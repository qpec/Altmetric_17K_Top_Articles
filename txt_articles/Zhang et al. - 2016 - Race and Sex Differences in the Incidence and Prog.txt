A
pproximately 635 000 new cases of coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD) occur annually in the United States, with 
an additional 155 000 incidentally discovered asymptomatic 
silent myocardial infarctions (SMIs).1 SMI, defined as the 
presence of pathological Q waves in the absence of a history 
of typical cardiac symptoms, is one of the important cardiac 
abnormalities that can be reasonably detected through ECG 
screening.2,3
Clinical Perspective on p 2148
Given that SMI is characterized by no or mild symptoms, 
patients with SMI are deprived medical treatments that could 
prevent subsequent adverse outcomes, including a second MI 
or even death.4 This underscores the importance of detecting 
SMI in clinical practice. In clinical trials evaluating interven-
tions to prevent or treat CHD, detection of unrecognized MI 
as a clinical end point has the potential to increase statisti-
cal power, to decrease sample sizes, and to reduce length of 
follow-up, cost, and potential harm from exposure.4
The reported incidence of SMI ranges from 22% to 60% 
of the total incidence of MI, and the prognosis of these SMIs 
has been shown to be similar to or worse than the prognosis 
for clinically recognized MI (CMI).4–27 However, the current 
understanding of the epidemiology of SMI is based primarily 
on studies in white populations of European ancestry8,11–15,18 or 
on studies with limited representation of both sexes.9,10,16,18,21,23 
The lack of race and sex diversity in these studies is occasion-
ally complicated by small sample size.7,28
Background—Race and sex differences in silent myocardial infarction (SMI) are not well established.
Methods and Results—The analysis included 9498 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study 
who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline (visit 1, 1987–1989). Incident SMI was defined as ECG evidence of 
MI without clinically documented MI (CMI) after the baseline until ARIC visit 4 (1996–1998). Coronary heart disease 
and all-cause deaths were ascertained starting from ARIC visit 4 until 2010. During a median follow-up of 8.9 years, 
317 participants (3.3%) developed SMI and 386 (4.1%) developed CMI. The incidence rates of both SMI and CMI were 
higher in men (5.08 and 7.96 per 1000-person years, respectively) than in women (2.93 and 2.25 per 1000-person years, 
respectively; P<0.0001 for both). Blacks had a nonsignificantly higher rate of SMI than whites (4.45 versus 3.69 per 
1000-person years; P=0.217), but whites had higher rate of CMI than blacks (5.04 versus 3.24 per 1000-person years; 
P=0.002). SMI and CMI (compared with no MI) were associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease death 
(hazard ratio, 3.06 [95% confidence interval, 1.88–4.99] and 4.74 [95% confidence interval, 3.26–6.90], respectively) 
and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.34 [95% confidence interval, 1.09–1.65] and 1.55 [95% confidence interval, 1.30–
1.85], respectively). However, SMI and CMI were associated with increased mortality among both men and women, with 
potentially greater increased risk among women (interaction P=0.089 and 0.051, respectively). No significant interactions 
by race were detected.
Conclusions—SMI represents >45% of incident MIs and is associated with poor prognosis. Race and sex differences in 
the incidence and prognostic significance of SMI exist that may warrant considering SMI in personalized assessments 
of coronary heart disease risk.  (Circulation. 2016;133:2141-2148 DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.021177.)

The aim of this study was to examine the race and sex differ-
ences in the incidence and prognostic significance of SMI ver-
sus MI with CMI in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
(ARIC) study, a community-based, predominantly biracial 
cohort study.
Methods
Study Population
The ARIC study was designed to investigate the causes of atheroscle-
rosis and its clinical outcomes, as well as variations in cardiovascular 
risk factors, medical care, and disease by race and sex.29 From 1987 to 
1989 (ARIC study baseline), 15 792 adults (55.2% women; age, 45–
64 years) from 4 US communities (Washington County, Maryland; 
suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; Jackson, MS; and Forsyth County, 
North Carolina) were enrolled and underwent a phone interview and 
clinic visit. Additional examinations were conducted in 1990 to 1992 
(visit 2), 1993 to 1995 (visit 3), 1996 to 1998 (visit 4), and 2011 
to 2013 (visit 5). Participants were mostly white in the Washington 
County and Minneapolis sites, exclusively black in Jackson, and a 
mix of both in Forsyth County. The study was approved by the institu-
tional review board at each study site. All participants provided writ-
ten informed consent.
For the purpose of this analysis, we included all ARIC participants 
with good-quality and complete ECG data at visits 1 through 4 and 
outcome events after visit 4. We excluded the following participants: 
47 with reported race other than black or white; 136 with poor-qual-
ity ECGs; 3775 with missing ECGs in any of the ARIC first 4 visits 
(including 871 who died before visit 4); 429 with an ECG diagnosis of 
bundle-branch block, external pacemaker, or Wolff-Parkinson-White 
pattern; and 201 with missing ≥1 baseline cardiovascular disease risk 
factors. We also excluded 1706 participants with a history of cardio-
vascular disease at baseline that was defined as the presence of ECG 
evidence of MI or a self-reported history of physician-diagnosed MI, 
coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty, heart failure, 
or stroke. After all exclusions (n=6294), 9498 subjects remained and 
were included in the analysis.
Silent MI
Incident SMI was defined as ECG evidence of new MI at ARIC visit 2, 
3, or 4 that was not present at the baseline visit (visit 1) in the absence 
of documented CMI. Participants with both SMI and CMI between 
ARIC visits 1 and 4 were considered to have CMI. Identical electro-
cardiographs (MAC PC, Marquette Electronics Inc, Milwaukee, WI) 
were used at all clinical sites, and resting 10-second standard simul-
taneous 12-lead ECGs were recorded in all participants using strictly 
standardized procedures. All ECGs were processed in a central ECG 
laboratory (initially at Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, 
and later at the Epidemiological Cardiology Research Center, Wake 
Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC), where all ECGs 
were visually inspected for technical errors and quality. ECG evi-
dence of MI was defined by the new appearance of Minnesota Code 
(MC) ECG classifications as a major Q/QS wave abnormality (MC 
1.1 or MC 1.2) or minor Q/QS wave abnormality (MC 1.3) plus 
major ST-T abnormality (MC 4.1, MC 4.2, MC 5.1, or MC 5.2).30,31 
Traditional serial change comparisons30 were not used.
CHD Death and All-Cause Mortality
CHD death and all-cause mortality were ascertained after ARIC visit 
4 (1996–1998) through December 31, 2010, from death certificates. 
Deaths and hospitalization events were ascertained in each clinical cen-
ter during an annual follow-up phone interview or through review of 
community hospital discharge indexes. Incident CHD events included 
definite or probable hospitalized MI (CMI in this analysis) or definite 
CHD death. All CHD event classifications and specific criteria, includ-
ing the adjudication process, have been described previously.32–34 CMI 
was based on physician review and adjudication of chest pain, cardiac 
biomarkers/enzymes from hospitalizations, ECG evidence including a 
new pathological Q wave, CHD history, the underlying cause of death 
from death certificates, and other associated information. All eligible 
hospitalized events were classified as definite, probable, suspect, or 
no MI. Definite MI and probable MI were combined to define CMI 
in this analysis. The definite hospitalized CMI met ≥1 of the follow-
ing criteria: evolving diagnostic ECG pattern, diagnostic ECG pattern 
and abnormal enzymes, or cardiac pain and abnormal enzymes plus

evolving ST-T pattern or equivocal ECG pattern. The probable hos-
pitalized MI met ≥1 of the following criteria in the absence of suffi-
cient evidence for definite hospitalized MI: cardiac pain and abnormal 
enzymes, cardiac pain and equivocal enzymes and either evolving ST-T 
pattern or diagnostic ECG pattern, or abnormal enzymes and evolv-
ing ST-T pattern. Criteria for each of these diagnostic elements in the 
algorithm remained constant over the study period and are described in 
detail in the ARIC study surveillance manual.31,33,34
Covariates
Baseline age, sex, race, education level, income, and smoking 
status were determined by self-report. Body mass index at base-
line was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height 
in meters squared. Blood samples were obtained after an 8-hour 
fasting period. Baseline diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting 
glucose level ≥126 mg/dL (or nonfasting glucose ≥200 mg/dL), a 
self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or the use of 
diabetes medications. Baseline hypertension was defined as systolic 
blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, 
or the use of blood pressure–lowering medications. At each study 
visit, medication history was obtained by self-report of medication 
intake during last 2 weeks and by a review of medications brought 
by the participants to their visits. Each medication was coded by 
trained and certified interviewers with the use of a computerized 
medication classification system. Prevalent stroke and peripheral 
arterial disease were identified by self-reported history of a previous 
physician diagnosis. Prevalent heart failure was identified by the 
Gothenburg criteria or self-reported history of heart failure medica-
tion use in the past 2 weeks.
Statistical Methods
Frequency distributions of the variables used in analyses were first 
inspected to rule out anomalies and outliers. Descriptive statistics 
were used to determine mean values, standard deviations, and per-
centile distributions for continuous variables, as well as frequencies 
and percentages for categorical variables.
During the period from visit 1 to 4, incidence rates of SMI and 
CMI were calculated per 1000 person-years, compared in all ARIC 
participants, and stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the asso-
ciations of SMI and CMI (versus no MI) occurring from visit 1 to 4 
with CHD death and all-cause mortality occurring after visit 4. The 
follow-up time included the time elapsed between the identification 
of SMI or CMI plus the time from visit 4 to the event. Non-CHD 
deaths were treated as censored. Models were incrementally adjusted 
as follows: Model 1 was adjusted for baseline demographics (age, 
sex, and race), and model 2 was adjusted for variables in model 1 
plus study field center, body mass index, income, education, smoking 
status, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure–lowering medications, 
diabetes mellitus, ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, use of cholesterol-lowering medications, use of aspirin, 
family history of CHD, and serum creatinine (all variables measured 
at baseline). Interactions by sex and race were examined in model 2. 
We examined the assumption of proportional hazards by computation 
of Schoenfeld residuals and inspection of log (−log [survival func-
tion]) curves, and they were met.
All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC). A 2-sided value of P<0.05 was considered 
significant. However, because the interaction tests were used only

and not testing a hypothesized effect modification, we used a more 
relaxed P value of 0.10 to define significance to detect interaction.35
Results
This analysis included 9498 participants (age at baseline, 
54.0±5.7 years; 56.9% women; and 20.3% black). From 
baseline through the fourth ARIC visit, 317 participants 
developed SMI, and 386 developed CMI. Table 1 shows the 
baseline characteristics of the study participants stratified by 
MI status.
Table 2 shows the incidence rates (per 1000 person-
years) of SMI and CMI, overall and stratified by sex and 
race. Overall, the incidence rate of CMI was slightly higher 
than the incidence rate of SMI. However, sex and race dif-
ferences in the incidence of SMI and CMI were observed. 
The incidence rates of both SMI and CMI were higher in 
men compared with women (P<0.0001). On the other hand, 
blacks had a nonsignificantly higher rate of SMI than whites 
(P=0.217), but whites had a higher rate of CMI than blacks 
(P=0.002). Figure 1 shows the incidence rates of SMI and 
CMI in white men, black men, white women, and black 
women. As shown, the incidence rate of SMI was higher 
than the rate of CMI in black women, which is the opposite 
of what is observed in white men, in whom CMI was more 
common than SMI. On the other hand, the incidence rates 
of SMI were comparable to those of CMI in white women 
and black men.

During a median follow-up of 13.2 years follow-up, 1833 
cases of all-cause mortality were detected, of which 189 
were CHD deaths. Figures 2 and 3 show the event-free sur-
vival curves by MI status (CHD death and all-cause mortality, 
respectively; no MI, SMI, and CMI).
In multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analy-
sis, both SMI and CMI (compared with no MI) were associ-
ated with increased risk of CHD death (Table 3) and all-cause 
mortality (Table 4). However, SMI and CMI were associated 
with increased risk of mortality among both men and women, 
with potentially greater increased risk among women (interac-
tion P=0.089 and 0.051, respectively). No significant interac-
tion by race was detected.
Discussion
In this analysis from the ARIC study, one of the largest com-
munity-based biracial cohort studies in the United States, we 
examined the sex and racial differences in the incidence and 
prognostic significance of silent versus CMI. The 3 key find-
ings are the following: (1) SMI is common (≈45% of the MIs 
are silent); (2) both SMI and CMI are associated with poor 
prognosis, with CMI showing slightly stronger association 
with risk of death than SMI; and (3) there are race and sex 
differences in the incidence and prognostic significance of 
SMI. These findings highlight the importance of detection of 
SMI and the potential impact of such detection on personal-
ized prevention of CHD that takes into account race and sex. 
This is further underscored by the known sex and race dispar-
ity in CHD incidence and prognosis36 and the fact that those 
with SMI are deprived medical attention compared with those 
with CMI.
Several previous studies have examined the prevalence, 
incidence, and prognostic significance of SMI.4–26 In literature 
reviews by Pride et al4 and Sheifer et al,37 SMI constituted up to 
44% of the total MIs and carried a prognosis that was as poor 
as that for CMIs. The prevalence and incidence of SMI dif-
fered, however, from 1 study to another. In the Cardiovascular 
Health Study (CHS), which is a predominantly white popu-
lation of elderly ≥65 years of age, SMI accounted for 22% 
of the prevalent MIs.19 In a similar cohort of elderly patients 
>75 years of age, the Bronx Aging Study, SMIs represented 
44% of the total MIs.17 On the other hand, in the Heart and

Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study Trial, which included 
only women, SMI constituted only 4% of the total MI,38 which 
is much lower than in the Reykjavik Study in Women, in 
which SMIs represented 33% of the total MIs.10 Similarly, dif-
ferent studies showed different prognoses of SMI, with some 
reporting similar or poorer prognosis17,26 and others showing 
better prognosis with SMI compared with CMI.7,39
Differences in the incidence and prognostic significance 
among various studies could be explained by differences in the 
population studied (eg, distribution of age, race, and sex) and 
the method by which SMI is detected (eg, Q wave in the ECG, 
myocardial scar in the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or 
areas of akinesia in the echocardiography). Even within stud-
ies that used ECG to define SMI there are differences: Some 
used serial Q/ST/T changes,26 and others used MI at each 
point of time as in our study. Regardless of these differences, 
the overall incidence and prognostic significance of SMI in 
these studies generally agree with our results. However, none 
of these studies had the large sample size or the ethnically 
diverse community-based population with good represen-
tation of both sexes that our study has. Hence, the race and 
sex differences in the incidence and prognostic significance 
of SMI were not appropriately examined in previous stud-
ies. Therefore, our results expand on the previous studies and 
extend our previous ARIC report on SMI that examined the 
incidence but not the prognostic significance of these MIs.40
Our observations of race and sex differences in the inci-
dence and prognostic significance of SMI add to the accumu-
lating evidence of sex and racial differences in cardiovascular 
disease outcomes and the potential differences in the impact 
of risk factors among sexes and races. Because we adjusted 
for several potential confounders, it is less likely that our 
observed sex and racial differences were confounded by dif-
ferences in MI-associated morbidities. Future investigation 
should assess whether genetic background, emerging risk fac-
tors, access to health care, awareness, and adherence to medi-
cations contribute to sex and racial differences.
Our results should be read in the context of certain limi-
tations. Our analyses included only whites and blacks; hence, 
our results may not be generalizable to other races/ethnicities. 
Although we adjusted for several potential confounders in the 
models examining the association between SMI and CMI with

outcomes, residual confounding remains a possibility as in all 
similar studies. Q waves often disappear after MI; thus, the inci-
dence of SMI in our study might be underestimated given the 
time between visits. In addition, the increasing sensitivity of 
troponin in the past decade probably has yielded more CMI and 
subsequently less SMI in the later stages of ARIC compared 
with earlier stages. Although this should not affect the race and 
sex differences, it may affect the trend of SMI over time. In 
addition, there were no significant changes in the sensitivity of 
troponin before 1998, the date our ascertainment of SMI ended. 
Despite these limitations, our study was able to document the 
race and sex differences in the incidence and prognostic signifi-
cance of SMI and to compare the results with CMI in a large, 
well-designed, prospective cohort study with long-term follow-
up, the ARIC study. Other strengths include standardized ECG 
procedures and carefully documented outcomes events ascer-
tained by an independent adjudication committee.
Conclusions
In the ARIC study, we showed that SMI is as common as CMI, 
that 45% of the MIs are silent, and that both SMI and CMI are 
associated with poor outcomes. However, there are race and 
sex differences in the incidence and prognostic significance 
of SMI. Thus, an accidental ECG finding of MI in individuals 
without a history of MI may warrant enhanced CHD preven-
tion efforts that take into account sex and race differences.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
This report from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, one of the largest community-based biracial cohort 
studies in the United States, shows that the presence of asymptomatic or silent myocardial infarction on screening ECGs 
is a common finding; ≈45% of the total number of myocardial infarctions in the study were silent. These silent myocardial 
infarctions were associated with increased risk of death in a magnitude that is relatively comparable to that of myocardial 
infarctions with clinical manifestations. However, race and sex differences in the incidence and prognostic significance of 
silent myocardial infarction were observed in this study. These findings highlight the importance of detecting silent myo-
cardial infarctions and the potential impact of such detection on personalized prevention of coronary heart disease that takes 
into account race and sex.
