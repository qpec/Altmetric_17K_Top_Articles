IMPORTANCE Prevention of obesity during childhood is critical for children in underserved
populations, for whom obesity prevalence and risk of chronic disease are highest.
OBJECTIVE To test the effect of a multicomponent behavioral intervention on child body
mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)
growth trajectories over 36 months among preschool-age children at risk for obesity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial assigned 610 parent-child
pairs from underserved communities in Nashville, Tennessee, to a 36-month intervention
targeting health behaviors or a school-readiness control. Eligible children were between ages
3 and 5 years and at risk for obesity but not yet obese. Enrollment occurred from August 2012
to May 2014; 36-month follow-up occurred from October 2015 to June 2017.
INTERVENTIONS The intervention (n = 304 pairs) was a 36-month family-based,
community-centered program, consisting of 12 weekly skills-building sessions, followed by
monthly coaching telephone calls for 9 months, and a 24-month sustainability phase
providing cues to action. The control (n = 306 pairs) consisted of 6 school-readiness sessions
delivered over the 36-month study, conducted by the Nashville Public Library.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was child BMI trajectory over 36
months. Seven prespecified secondary outcomes included parent-reported child dietary
intake and community center use. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure corrected
for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS Participants were predominantly Latino (91.4%). At baseline, the mean (SD) child
age was 4.3 (0.9) years; 51.9% were female. Household income was below $25 000 for
56.7% of families. Retention was 90.2%. At 36 months, the mean (SD) child BMI was 17.8
(2.2) in the intervention group and 17.8 (2.1) in the control group. No significant difference
existed in the primary outcome of BMI trajectory over 36 months (P = .39). The intervention
group children had a lower mean caloric intake (1227 kcal/d) compared with control group
children (1323 kcal/d) (adjusted difference, −99.4 kcal [95% CI, −160.7 to −38.0]; corrected
P = .003). Intervention group parents used community centers with their children more than
control group parents (56.8% in intervention; 44.4% in control) (risk ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.08
to 1.53]; corrected P = .006).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A 36-month multicomponent behavioral intervention did not
change BMI trajectory among underserved preschool-age children in Nashville, Tennessee,
compared with a control program. Whether there would be effectiveness for other types of
behavioral interventions or implementation in other cities would require further research.

besityoftenbeginsinchildhood,withthehighestrates
among minority populations.1,2 Numerous random-
ized clinical trials (RCTs) address childhood obesity
treatmentbytargetingchildhealthbehaviorssuchasdiet,physi-
cal activity, sleep, and media use.3 These behavioral interven-
tions have met with variable efficacy and often yield small, if
any, effect sizes on child weight outcomes.4,5 In addition,
whereas several interventions have been successful at produc-
ing short-term reductions in child body mass index (BMI), few
trials have been of sufficient length to assess sustainability.6
Obesity is a complex problem, affected by the dynamic in-
teraction of biology, behavior, and children’
s social and physi-
cal environments.7,8 Given the challenges associated with ef-
fective obesity treatment, recent focus has been on childhood
obesityprevention.5,9Thedevelopmentaloriginsofdiseasehy-
pothesis suggests that early life influences can alter a per-
son’
s life-long health trajectory, linking early obesogenic ex-
posures and rapid weight trajectory to common chronic adult
conditions including coronary artery disease and type 2
diabetes.10,11 These problems are especially salient for fami-
lies from traditionally underserved minorities,12 who are con-
fronted with significant barriers such as poverty.
The Growing Right Onto Wellness (GROW) RCT tested
a theoretically grounded, 36-month behavior change inter-
vention focused on childhood obesity prevention among
preschool-aged children from underserved communities. It
was hypothesized that the intervention would attenuate
child BMI growth trajectories compared with the control
group over 36 months.
Methods
This study was conducted within the Childhood Obesity Pre-
vention and Treatment Research consortium, a National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development–sponsored collaborative
effort to develop and evaluate novel approaches to prevent
or treat childhood obesity. The study was supported by
an independent coordinating center at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The Vanderbilt University Medical Center institutional re-
view board and a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–
appointed data and safety monitoring board approved the
study protocol and conducted routine evaluations of partici-
pant safety and protocol adherence throughout the trial.
Written informed consent was obtained by bilingual data
collectors in participants’language of choice using an en-
hanced, low-literacy approach.13
The intervention focused on changing behavior and fea-
turedseveralkeystrategieshypothesizedtomaximizehealthbe-
haviorchange,including(1)consideringthehealthbehaviorsof
both parent and child, (2) using the built environment of exist-
ing community centers, (3) implementing a tiered-intensity
intervention to maximize sustainability of participation,
and (4) using an adaptive intervention.7 The study’
s design and
methodology have been previously reported.14 The protocol
and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1.
Setting and Participants
Parent-child pairs were recruited from 54 physicians’offices
andcommunitysettingsandenrolledfromAugust2012toMay
2014 in Nashville, Tennessee. The final 36-month follow-up
was conducted between October 2015 and June 2017. Recruit-
ment efforts included posters, mailed brochures, radio com-
mercials, community events, in-person recruitment, and word
of mouth. Child eligibility criteria included age 3 to 5 years,
English or Spanish speaking, and high normal weight to over-
weightbutnotyetobese(BMI≥50thand<95thpercentilebased
on US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard-
ized growth curves).15 Caregiver eligibility included commit-
ment to participate in the 36-month study, English or Spanish
speaking, and consistent telephone access.
Participants also had to qualify for at least 1 service for un-
derserved populations (eg, Medicaid; Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children). Partici-
pants were excluded if a medical condition precluded routine
physical activity or if participants lived or worked outside an
8-km radius of participating community centers. Because obe-
sity disproportionately affects children from underserved
minorities,12raceandethnicityinformationwascollected.Race
and ethnicity for both parent and child were assessed by par-
ent report, using fixed categories with an open-ended option.
Randomization
Participants were randomized using a computer-generated
schedule that was stratified by community center and parent
language preference (English or Spanish). Randomly per-
muted block sizes varied from 2 to 6. Assignment was imple-
mented through an electronic interface that concealed group
assignmentuntileachindividualwasenrolled.Onlystudystaff
not involved in data collection implemented randomization,
and group assignment could not be changed.
Intervention Description
Informed by effective adult obesity treatment behavioral
trials16,17 and innovative concepts proposed by the National
Institutes of Health,18 the intervention (GROW Healthier)
was a tiered-intensity program of decreasing intensity:
(1) a 12-week intensive phase with weekly 90-minute skills-
building sessions via either in-person groups or telephone
calls; (2) a 9-month maintenance phase with monthly coach-
ing telephone calls; and (3) a 24-month sustainability phase
Key Points
Question What is the effect of a 36-month multicomponent
behavioral intervention for obesity prevention on body mass index
(BMI) trajectories in underserved preschool-age children at risk for
obesity but not yet obese?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 610
parent-child pairs from underserved communities, the mean BMI
in both the intervention and control groups was 17.8 at 36 months,
with no significant difference in BMI trajectories.
Meaning The behavioral intervention was not effective in this
low-income minority population.

 providing frequent cues to action (eg, texts, personalized let-
ters, monthly calls) to use parks and recreation programming
for healthy family behaviors. The intervention was based on
social cognitive theory and the socioecological model, focus-
ing on behavior change techniques including goal setting,
self-monitoring, and problem solving in the context of par-
ticipants’home and community environments.19,20
Interventioncontentincludedskillsbuildingforparentsand
children regarding nutritional choices, physical activity hab-
its, use of the family and built environment, engaged parent-
ing, healthy sleep, and reduced media time.21 Each week
(intensive phase) or month (maintenance phase), participants
created a self-defined goal about family health behaviors tar-
geted in the intervention (diet, physical activity, sleep, media
use, engaged parenting). The intervention included an adap-
tivecomponent,anadditionalcoachingtelephonecall14thatpro-
vided BMI results and additional guided goal setting and
problem solving; this occurred when a child’
s BMI category in-
creased or remained obese at a data collection time point.
The control condition (GROW Smarter) was a school-
readiness program developed and delivered by the Nashville
Public Library. The curriculum consisted of six 30-minute
group-based activities delivered concurrently with data col-
lection sessions. Participants in the intervention and control
groups received the school-readiness program. Therefore, the
only difference between conditions was the obesity preven-
tion intervention.

Outcomes
The prespecified primary outcome was child BMI trajectory
across 36 months modeled using linear and quadratic
terms. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared. The protocol identified 7 pre-
specified secondary outcomes: (1) child mean daily energy in-
take (kcal); mean percentage of energy intake from (2) fat,
(3) carbohydrates, and (4) protein; mean daily minutes spent
in (5) rest and sedentary behavior and (6) moderate and vig-
orous physical activity (MVPA); and (7) community center use
with child (never or at least once). Prevalence of child obesity
(BMI ≥95th percentile) was the only post-hoc outcome ana-
lyzed. Parent anthropometrics and child waist circumference/
triceps skinfold were also collected but not included as sec-
ondary outcomes in this analysis.

Of the 610 parent-child pairs
randomized, 304 were randomized
to the intervention group and 306
were randomized to the control
group. At each time point, the
number retained represents the
number of children for whom BMI
was collected. Missing body mass
index (BMI) falls into 2 categories:
BMI measure missing but BMI was
collected at a later time point vs
permanently lost to follow-up with no
further BMI measures collected. The
cumulative number of parent-child
pairs permanently lost to follow-up is
indicated at each time point above,
and was 26 for the intervention
group and 34 for the control group at
year 3 follow-up.
a Because the primary analysis used
an intention-to-treat approach,
all participants were analyzed in
the group to which they were
randomized, regardless of
missing data.

 Data were collected at baseline and 3, 9, 12, 24, and 36
months by trained, blinded, bilingual data collectors in par-
ticipant homes or local community centers. Data collected in-
cluded parent and child height (without shoes, to nearest
0.1 cm) and weight (to nearest 0.1 kg) using wall-mounted sta-
diometers and research-grade scales. Annually, children were
askedtowearaGT3X+accelerometer(ActiGraph)ontheirwaist
for 24 hours daily for 7 consecutive days to assess physical ac-
tivity. Previously validated cut points determined time spent
in sedentary behaviors and light, moderate, and vigorous
activities.22 Data obtained annually from 24-hour diet recall
on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day assessed parent-reported
child dietary intake (using NDS-R software).
Survey data were collected in the participant’
s chosen lan-
guage via guided administration and included demographic,
behavioral, and psychosocial domains. Parent-reported com-
munity center use with the child was assessed through the sur-
vey item: “How often do you go to your community recre-
ation center with your children to be active together?” (6-point
scale from “never” to “every day”), and the responses were di-
chotomized into “never” or “at least once” for analysis. Food
insecurity was assessed using the 6-item short form of the US
Household Food Security Survey Module.23
Participants were encouraged to complete all data collec-
tion elements within 45 days of anthropometric data collec-
tion.Processmeasuresincludedfidelityofimplementationand
dosereceived.Fidelitywasassessedusingstandardizedtools14
for both in-person and telephone call sessions. Dose received
was measured by attendance at in-person sessions or partici-
pation in telephone calls throughout the study.
Adverse Event Reporting
Adverse events were identified throughout the study period by
encouraging participants to contact the study team if an event
occurredandbyaskingparticipantsaboutadverseeventsusing
a structured questionnaire at all data collection time points.
Sample Size
A power analysis was conducted with a 2-tailed α = .05 and
90% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.4. Results
suggested that a final sample of 480 pairs was required. There-
fore, 600 pairs were planned, with an anticipated 80% reten-
tion rate. The effect size of 0.4 was selected based on data from
a previous behavioral intervention conducted in Nashville
among Latino participants (trial protocol in Supplement 1).24
Statistical Methods
Baseline characteristics were expressed as mean (SD) or
median (quartile 1, quartile 3), depending on their distribu-
tion, or number (%) for categorical variables. This trial used
an intention-to-treat approach to test the difference in the
BMI growth trajectory between children in the intervention
and control groups. The analysis fit a 2-level (time nested
within child) mixed-effects regression model, using a maxi-
mum likelihood procedure to handle missing data and an
unstructured variance-covariance matrix.25 Data were
assumed to be missing at random. Because clinical literature
about childhood obesity indicates that the shape of the BMI
trajectory across ages 3 to 8 years is curvilinear, a quadratic
model was selected a priori, defining trajectory using both
linear and quadratic terms.15,26 Time varied individually and
was measured as a continuous variable defined as years since
baseline. Two child-level variables, age at baseline (mean-
centered) and intervention condition, were covariates for the
intercept, linear, and quadratic BMI growth trajectory terms.
Child sex was a covariate for the intercept only. Success was
evaluated by a likelihood ratio test to determine whether the
linear and quadratic intervention effects were jointly equal to
zero (df = 2; .05 level). The coordinating center indepen-
dently replicated the primary outcome analysis and con-
firmed the findings.
Analysis of secondary and post-hoc outcomes used ordi-
nary least squares regression for continuous outcomes and
Poisson regression with robust standard errors for binary out-
comes. Models were prespecified and accounted for covari-
ates thought to be associated with each outcome, such as
baseline outcome value, child age, and sex. The Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure was used to control the false-discovery
rate for multiple comparisons based on the number of time
points analyzed for each outcome. The P values before and
after correction are presented. Residual diagnostics were per-
formed to ensure distributional assumptions were met.
Prior literature informed selection of a series of post-hoc
moderator analyses based on the child BMI growth trajec-
tory mixed-effects model to determine whether the inter-
vention’
s effect on growth trajectory varied across different
baseline values of child age; child sex; parent BMI; parent
race/ethnicity; child energy intake; percentage of energy
intake from fat, carbohydrates, and protein; percentage of
wear time in sedentary behavior and MVPA; baseline child
BMI percentile; child birth weight; food security status; and
community center.27,28

Results
Of the 2126 participants assessed for eligibility, 610 parent-
child pairs were randomized, with 304 assigned to the inter-
vention group and 306 to the control group. The 36-month
retention rate was 91.4% for the intervention and 88.9% for
the control (Figure 1). At baseline, the child mean (SD) age
was 4.3 (0.9) years, 51.9% were female, 91.4% were Hispanic/
Latino, 65.7% were between the 50th and 85th Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention BMI percentiles, and 34.3%
were between the 85th and 95th percentiles. Most study chil-
dren were born in the United States (96.4%), whereas most
adults were born outside the United States, including Mexico
(63.6%), El Salvador (9.4%), Honduras (6.6%), and Guatemala
(6.1%). The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children and/or Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program was used by 87.5% of families, and
42.6% of families reported food insecurity. Table 1 shows
baseline data by study group.

 Primary Outcome
The mean (SD) child BMI at 36 months was 17.8 (2.2) in the
intervention group and 17.8 (2.1) in the control group.
Adjusted models showed no significant BMI difference
(B = 0.05 [95% CI, −0.29 to 0.38]; P = .79) at 36 months
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Box plots of child BMI at each
time point for the intervention and control groups are pre-
sented in Figure 2. No meaningful intervention effect was
detected on the prespecified primary outcome of child BMI
trajectory over 3 years (joint likelihood ratio test, P = .39).
Neither the linear intervention effect (BMI difference per
year) (B = −0.082 [95% CI, −0.246 to 0.082]; P = .33) nor the
quadratic effect (BMI difference per year squared) (B = 0.032
[95% CI, −0.014 to 0.078]; P = .18) was statistically significant
(Figure 3). Model-estimated child BMI trajectories by sex and
age are presented in eFigure 1 in Supplement 2.
Secondary Outcomes
Analyses of secondary outcomes are shown in Table 2. At 36
months, the mean (SD) child daily energy intake was 1227
(363) kcal for children in the intervention group and 1323
(397) kcal for children in the control group. The intervention
resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean child
daily energy intake compared with the control group, which
persisted across the 3 yearly time points. At 36 months,
regression models indicated that parents in the intervention
group reported their children consumed 99.4 kcal fewer than
the control group (95% CI, 38.0-160.7; P = .002; corrected
P = .003) and a slightly greater percentage of energy intake
from protein at 24 and 36 months. No statistically significant
intervention effects were detected for percentage of energy
from fat or carbohydrates or mean daily time in sedentary
behavior or MVPA. At 36 months, 56.8% of parents in the

 intervention group reported use of a community center with
their child compared with 44.4% in the control group.
Adjusted models indicated that participants in the interven-
tion group were more likely to use a community center with
their child vs those in the control group at all yearly time
points (36-month adjusted risk ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.08-1.53];
P = .004; corrected P = .006).
Post-Hoc Outcomes
At study end, when children were ages 6 to 8 years, 25.4% of
children in the intervention group and 23.5% of children in the
control group were overweight, and 35.5% of children in the
intervention group and 34.2% of children in the control group
were obese. Children eligible for the adaptive intervention in-
creasedovertime:n = 39at3-month;n = 45at9-month;n = 46
at 12-month; and n = 102 at 24-month follow-up. In post-hoc
analysis, children in the intervention group had a signifi-
cantly lower risk of developing obesity at 3-month follow-up
compared with the control group before correcting for mul-
tiple comparisons (adjusted risk ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.29-
0.92]; P = .02; corrected P = .10). The intervention effect on re-
ducing the estimated risk of obesity at 3 months increased as
child baseline BMI increased above the mean (eFigure 2 in
Supplement 2). The lower risk of obesity was not sustained at
other time points (Table 3).
Post-hoc exploratory moderator analyses indicated sta-
tistically significant intervention effects on the linear and qua-
dratic growth of BMI of children who were food insecure with
hunger at baseline (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). Significant
quadratic intervention effects were also found for males and
baseline child energy intake. No other statistically significant
moderator effects were found (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Adherence to Study Protocol
The mean dose received among intervention participants was
92% for the intensive phase, 87% for the maintenance phase,
and 85% for the sustainability phase. School-readiness dose
receipt in both conditions was 83% throughout the study
period. No crossover occurred between conditions. Fidelity to
the intervention curriculum was 99% over the 3 years.

 Adverse Events
One parent fractured an ankle while roller-skating during an
event at a local community center. No additional intervention-
related adverse events occurred.
Discussion
This 36-month community-based, family-centered, behav-
ioral intervention did not change BMI trajectory in under-
served preschool children who were not yet obese. The pri-
mary outcome of child BMI trajectory was selected in lieu of
other standardized outcomes (eg, BMI z score) to capture
potential differences in child growth curve shapes known to
be predictive of later cardiovascular risk.11,30 Throughout
the 36-month trial, the intervention and control groups dem-
onstrated nearly identical growth trajectories and rates of
obesity. The prevalence of obesity observed in both the
intervention and control groups was similar to the regional
prevalence of obesity for Latino children (37.7%), indicating

 that the behavioral intervention did not alter the usual pat-
tern of obesity in this low-income minority population.31 The
study was adequately powered to detect differences in child
BMI trajectory and achieved 90% retention with little differ-
ential attrition. In addition, the precision of the effect esti-
mates (ie, confidence intervals for the difference in mean
child BMI trajectories) is sufficient to conclude that no mean-
ingful difference existed in the primary outcome between the
intervention and control groups.
Of the more than 350 RCTs conducted to prevent or treat
childhood obesity, few have demonstrated successful BMI
change and most have studied higher-resourced populations,
had small effect sizes not always of clinical significance,
and/or lacked long-term follow-up. RCTs conducted with
high quality and an independent coordinating center have
consistently failed to produce meaningful, sustained results
in childhood obesity prevention.32,33 This pattern of unsuc-
cessful childhood obesity prevention interventions is consis-
tent with the findings of this study, which, to our knowledge,
is the largest and longest obesity prevention RCT of its kind
to date. This study was consistent with recent recommenda-
tions from the US Preventive Services Task Force to achieve
26 hours of contact time in year 1 but then it decreased in
subsequent years.34 The US Preventive Services Task Force
examined the dose required for obesity treatment for chil-
dren 6 years and older. There are no guidelines yet for what is
needed to achieve effective obesity prevention. Prevention of
childhood obesity in low-income, underserved populations
could require an increased intensity of behavioral interven-
tions over longer periods of time.
While there was no effect on the primary outcome, the
multicomponent intervention demonstrated effects on the
secondary outcomes of diet and use of the community center
for physical activity. Children in the intervention condition
consumed almost 100 fewer kcal per day and had a higher
percentage of energy from protein compared with children in
the control condition. While the intervention did not change
the already high levels of child MVPA, children in the inter-
vention used their local community centers for family physi-
cal activity more frequently than the control group, although
the control group participants increased their use as well.
Previous research has hypothesized that health behavior
changes of this magnitude would result in modest improve-
ments in BMI.35 However, previous population-based model-
ing studies have indicated that populations from different
socioeconomic strata as well as racial and ethnic subgroups
have different thresholds for achieving healthy weight, with
Latino and African American populations requiring more
than 100-kcal differences.35
There are several potential explanations for why a close
to 100-kcal reduction and increased use of the built environ-
ment would not result in child BMI change. First, measure-
ment bias due to the reliance on parent-report measures may
have led to these results, suggesting the need for confirma-
tion in controlled settings.36,37 However, the multipass proto-
col required for 24-hour diet recalls and the absence of direct
nutrition education during the more passive 24-month sus-
tainability phase might make a systematic measurement bias
less likely. Second, while some individual behavior change can
result from interventions such as these, achieving a suffi-
cient amount of individual-level behavior changes in the fam-
ily and community environment may not be feasible for these
extremely low-income minority populations.
A notable characteristic of this trial was the exclusive
enrollment of parent-child pairs from significant poverty.
Parental depression was reported by 21.4% of these fam-
ilies, and 42.6% reported food insecurity at baseline. Previ-
ous literature suggests that biologically embedded obesity
phenotypes can be produced by toxic stress, altering homeo-
static regulation of pathways that influence resting metabolic
rate, satiety set points, and epigenetics even before obesity
manifests.38 Research has also found that diversity of micro-
biome species and exposure to endocrine disruptors early in
life affect changes in metabolic function, in some cases,
regardless of calories consumed.39,40 These influences could
potentially alter an individual’
s energy balance so that even a
statistically significant reduction in daily energy intake might
not be clinically meaningful. Further evaluation may be
warranted and underscores the importance of measuring
biological-level mediators in long-term, high-intensity
behavioral obesity interventions.
Post-hoc analyses indicated several findings that should
be interpreted with caution, generating hypotheses for future
research. First, the intervention reduced obesity prevalence
after the 3-month intensive phase, but this reduction was not
sustained. The effect was most pronounced in children with

 higher baseline BMI. This finding is consistent with previous
literature on childhood obesity treatment in which short-
term BMI improvements are achieved for those with higher
baseline BMI, but long-term BMI improvements are not real-
ized. Second, post-hoc moderator analyses indicated that the
intervention may have been more effective for certain popu-
lation subgroups, suggesting that tailored interventions may
be needed. The moderator analyses indicated that interven-
tiongroupchildrenwhoexperiencedfoodinsecuritywithhun-
ger at baseline had a different BMI growth trajectory over 3
years. This finding emphasizes the importance of addressing
systemic factors that affect health behaviors to achieve child
obesity prevention.
Limitations
Thisstudyhadseverallimitations.First,becausethestudywas
conducted among low-income minority populations, the find-
ings should not be generalized to other populations. Second,
data on biological measures of cardiovascular or diabetes risk
were not collected. Third, energy and nutrient intake were as-
sessed by parent report of child diet and subject to social de-
sirability bias that may differ as a result of intervention
participation.37 Fourth, this trial focused on the preschool pe-
riod, which may not be the optimal age for obesity preven-
tion. Future research should clarify the optimal timing of obe-
sity prevention interventions.
Conclusions
A 36-month multicomponent behavioral intervention did not
change BMI trajectory among underserved preschool-age chil-
dren in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with a control pro-
gram. Whether there would be effectiveness for other types
of behavioral interventions or implementation in other cities
would require further research.
