ABSTRACT
Objective To assess the relationships between golf and
health.
Design Scoping review.
Data sources Published and unpublished reports of
any age or language, identified by searching electronic
databases, platforms, reference lists, websites and from
consulting experts.
Review methods A 3-step search strategy identified
relevant published primary and secondary studies as well
as grey literature. Identified studies were screened for
final inclusion. Data were extracted using a standardised
tool, to form (1) a descriptive analysis and (2) a thematic
summary.
Results and discussion 4944 records were identified
with an initial search. 301 studies met criteria for the
scoping review. Golf can provide moderate intensity
physical activity and is associated with physical health
benefits that include improved cardiovascular, respiratory
and metabolic profiles, and improved wellness. There is
limited evidence related to golf and mental health. The
incidence of golfing injury is moderate, with back injuries
the most frequent. Accidental head injuries are rare, but
can have serious consequences.
Conclusions Practitioners and policymakers can be
encouraged to support more people to play golf, due to
associated improved physical health and mental well-
being, and a potential contribution to increased life
expectancy. Injuries and illnesses associated with golf
have been identified, and risk reduction strategies are
warranted. Further research priorities include systematic
reviews to further explore the cause and effect nature of
the relationships described. Research characterising golf’s
contribution to muscular strengthening, balance and falls
prevention as well as further assessing the associations
and effects between golf and mental health are also
indicated.
INTRODUCTION
The objective of this scoping review is to map the
literature on golf and health and to examine the
relationships and effects of golf on physical and
mental health.
Golf is a sport usually played on a large open-air
course, in which a ball is struck with a club, with
the aim of taking the lowest number of shots pos-
sible to get the ball into a series of holes in the
ground. Golf is played by around 55 million
people1 in 206 countries worldwide2 representing
1/127 of the global population. This global reach,
and appeal to persons of all ages and abilities has
seen golf reintroduced in 2016 to the Olympic
Games, with efforts ongoing to secure Paralympic
status for disability golf. Further information about
golf is shown in online supplementary appendix 1.
Health is influenced by a range of individual
behaviours and characteristics, and the physical,
social and economic environment that people are
subject to.3 There is compelling evidence that
regular physical activity has longevity, physical and
mental health benefits for people of all ages,
genders, geographical and socioeconomic back-
grounds, and can deliver economic benefits for
communities, as well as national and international
policymakers.4–6
Golf has potential to provide physical activity,
and thus health and social benefits to persons of all
ages.
Golf
is
particularly
popular
among
middle-aged and older adults, who are generally
less active than younger adults.7
8 To date the
review evidence on this topic is limited. Previous
reviews,9 10 including a systematic review,11 have
been
undertaken
to
consider
the
relationships
between golf and health with many of these focus-
ing on the subject of golf-related injuries, while a
further review of undocumented methodology12
focused on health benefits only. A recent systematic
review of health benefits related to sport suggested
that evidence was conclusive only for football
(soccer) and running, noting further evaluation and
research looking at other sports, including golf, was
required.13 A clear need exists to comprehensively
review the relationships between golf and health. W
e
therefore undertook a scoping review that maps
available evidence, in order to identify the existing
gaps in evidence and document impacts of golf on
health where these data were available.
METHODS
W
e
adopted
the
established
five-stage
scoping
review process proposed by Arksey and O’Malley,
incorporating adaptions from Levac et al, and the
Joanna Briggs Institute14–16 as per our published
protocol.17
The
following
summarises
our
approach to each stage.
Stage 1: Identify the research question
Considering the populations, concepts and contexts
of interest enabled a broad research question to be
formulated:
What is known about the relationships and effects
of golf on physical and mental health?
Stage 2: Identifying relevant studies
The following explicit inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria were developed through researcher discussion
and expert consultation:

 Inclusion criteria:
▸ Research articles not limited by geographical location, lan-
guage or setting.
▸ All age groups and both sexes of participants.
▸ Research that considers the general population, as well as
specific population groups (with a specific physical or mental
illness or condition).
▸ All forms of golf (including but not limited to 18 holes, 9
holes, driving range, spectating).
▸ Any physical and/or mental health condition.
▸ Sources of information, including primary research studies,
reviews, systematic reviews, scoping reviews, meta-analyses,
guidelines, as well as grey literature to include unpublished
and ongoing trials, annual reports, dissertations and confer-
ence proceedings.
Exclusion criteria:
▸ Opinion pieces/opinions, magazine and newspaper articles,
case reports, papers with no data.
▸ Health and safety/occupational issues not related to playing
or watching golf.
▸ Studies focusing on biomechanics, or improved performance
in golf.
Search strategies and databases
Step 1: An initial limited search
An initial limited search (September 2015) of SPORTDiscus
and Google Advanced Search for review articles and ProQuest
for dissertations was conducted as detailed in the published
protocol.17
Step 2: Identify key words and index terms
The title, abstract and index terms used to describe the
articles identified in step 1 were analysed. The research
team identified golf as the only primary research term. For
the
health-focused
databases,
namely
MEDLINE
and
PsycINFO, ‘golf ’ was used as the only search term to maxi-
mise inclusivity. Secondary search terms included a broader
set of keywords for SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and
Google Scholar. Boolean terms AND and OR were used to
extract
relevant
studies.
All
relevant
articles
from
SPORTDiscus and Web of Science were reviewed, with the
same search strategy applying to Google Scholar. A prag-
matic decision to review only the Google Scholar articles
with these terms in the title was taken following consult-
ation with a research librarian.
A similar strategy was applied to the grey literature. The
same search terms used for SPORTDiscus, Web of Science
and Google Scholar were applied to search for theses in the
ProQuest database. ‘Golf’ as the only search term was used
for the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.
The advanced search function on Google was used to look
for
relevant
reports
and
articles
from
the
World
Golf
Foundation, the Royal and Ancient, the British Journal of
Sports Medicine, The American College of Sports Medicine
and the Faculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine while repre-
sentatives of these organisations were contacted for further
information.
Step 3: Further searching of references and citations
A search was conducted of the reference list of the most rele-
vant identified articles while authors of relevant primary com-
prehensive, scoping or systematic reviews were contacted for
further information.
The complete final search strategy is shown in online supple-
mentary appendix 2.
Stage 3: Study selection
Relevant titles and abstracts were evaluated against the eligibility
criteria by one reviewer (ADM). A second reviewer (LD) com-
pleted the same process on a random sample of 10% of titles
and abstracts, with concordance >97% regarding inclusion/
exclusion decision. Where a consensus was not reached, the
study proceeded to full-text review.
Scoping reviews are typically iterative, as reviewers become
increasingly familiar with the research and evidence.14 W
e wished
to focus on the relationships and effects of golf on physical and
mental health. T
o enhance this focus, ‘studies focusing on bio-
mechanics, or improved performance in golf’ was added to the
existing exclusion criteria stated in the scoping review protocol.17
Full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria were sourced.
Translations by University staff and associates who were fluent
speakers of Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Spanish and Thai to English were undertaken. Despite searching
the University of Edinburgh library databases, using interlibrary
loans and contacting authors, 318–20 of 365 papers could not be
found and were excluded.
Stage 4: Charting the data
Extracting the results
Charting tables to record and assimilate extracted data from
included studies were developed. A priori categories were
charted as were emergent themes. Three reviewers (ADM, LD
and EJ) undertook data extraction duties. A sample data extrac-
tion form is shown in online supplementary appendix 3. ADM
extracted data from 90% of included studies and LD/EJ
extracted data from 10% of studies. LD/EJ checked 10% of
ADM’s data extractions for accuracy and vice versa. Any dis-
crepancies were discussed at group meetings. Concordance was
>97% regarding inclusion/exclusion.

Stage 5: Collating, summarising and reporting the results
Methods employed in the protocol17 enabled us to collate existing
knowledge on this broad topic and summarise and report as
1. A descriptive analysis, mapping the data, showing distribu-
tion of studies by period of publication, country of origin,
study method and theme/focus.
2. A thematic summary, describing how identified research
relates to the research question and aims, and the main find-
ings from these organised by theme.
In this study, we aim to:
A. Map the evidence and key concepts available for golf and
health.
B. Summarise and share existing research findings in a useful way
for policymakers, practitioners and other relevant stakeholders.
C. Identify research gaps in the existing literature on golf and
health.

 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Descriptive analysis
A review flow diagram (see figure 1) details the results from the
search, and study selection processes.
Our initial search identified 4944 studies. Of these, 4041
were identified searching databases/search platforms, and 903
from grey literature. After duplicates were excluded, 3380
records remained. A further 43 eligible studies were identified
by snowballing or via expert consultation during the step 3
search.
In total, 362 articles underwent full-text screening, 3015
records being excluded after abstract screening with a further 3
articles excluded as full text was unavailable.
Overall, the scoping review identified 301 eligible studies rele-
vant to the aims and research question ‘What is known about
the relationships and effects of golf on physical and mental
health?’ and these are included in the analysis.
Included studies by year of publication
In keeping with wider bibliometric trends in sport and health
research, figure 2 highlights a substantial chronological increase
in the number of papers relating to golf and health, with an
associated increase in the range of study designs and research
questions.
Geography of included studies
Research studies were identified from 24 countries and in 9 lan-
guages. Table 1 demonstrates the percentage of included studies
per country. The majority (53.8%) of included studies were
from the USA, where almost half of the world’s golfers live.2
Studies from North America (57.1%), Europe (22.3%) and
Oceania (10.0%) are relatively well represented, as they are
generally for research publications on physical activity.21 There
were fewer included studies per golfing facility (eg, golf course,
driving range and practice facilities) from Asia (10.0%) and
Africa (0.3%), and none included from South America.
Type of study
Study design
The studies varied considerably in terms of study design and
primary focus. No formal quality assessment of included
studies was performed as scoping reviews are intended to
provide a map of what evidence has been produced as
opposed to seeking only the best available evidence to answer
a narrow policy or practice-related question.15 A taxonomy
of research designs included by the scoping review is shown
in figure 3.
One
hundred
and
seventy-eight
(59.1%)
were
primary
research, while 89 (29.5%) were secondary studies and 34
(11.3%) were grey literature.
Of the primary literature, 118 (66.3%) studies had a cross-
sectional design, with 14 (7.9%) longitudinal and 46 (25.8%)
experimental. The majority of the experimental studies quan-
tified golf parameters, for example, steps taken or calories
burned while playing golf. Overall 16 of 301 studies con-
ducted a primary assessment of health outcomes in relation
to golf, while only 4 conducted interventions principally
aiming to promote behaviour change in relation to golf and
health.
The vast majority of secondary studies were reviews. Only six
of these were systematic reviews. The systematic reviews each
focused on a narrow aspect of the broad topic of golf and
health.
The grey literature comprised 17 published conference pro-
ceedings, 11 theses and 6 organisational reports.

 Theme of the study
The primary focus of the included studies fitted broadly into
four key themes, namely
1. Physical activity and golf (N=49).
2. Golf and physical health (non-injury/accident) (N=49).
3. Golf and injury/accident (N=135).
4. Golf and mental health/wellness (N=29).
These themes were formed from merging of the a priori cat-
egories identified. Additional studies from emergent themes
were classified into a further category ‘other and general’
(N=39) to include studies of golf participation, implications for
policy, legal implications or studies that focus evenly on more
than one of these areas. Articles focusing on injuries and acci-
dents relating to golf were the most frequent, comprising nearly
44.9% of included studies despite the exclusion of articles with
a biomechanical/performance focus. Figure 4 shows the primary
focus of included studies.
THEMATIC SUMMARY
Key concepts and evidence available
Participation
Golf is a sport played by 55 million people in 206 countries, by
males and females across the life-course.1 2 Globally, this com-
pares to 250 million direct participants in football (soccer),22 75
million tennis23 and 5 million rugby union players.24 Gaining
health benefits and exercise are powerful motivators for persons
to play sport, and golf in particular.25–27 Golfers more frequently
continue to play into middle age compared with participants in
sports like football and rugby.28 29 Golf is played by people of all
backgrounds, but participation is stronger in males,8 30 higher
socioeconomic groups7 and more affluent countries.2
Golf and physical activity
Golf can contribute to physical activity as a leisure time or rec-
reational activity, while work and occupation yields physical
activity
for
modest
numbers
of
professional
players
and
caddies.31
The relative contribution of golf to population physical activ-
ity increases in older adults,27 31 a group that are typically less
physically active than younger adults,32 but for all ages remains
considerably less than recreational walking, which is highly
accessible and often bears zero cost.31
Individual differences in energy expenditure can be large,
depending on individual and golf-related factors, but golf can
provide moderate intensity physical activity. Moderate intensity
physical activity is recommended for children, adults and older
adults for the longevity, physical and mental health effects it
brings.33–35 Golf typically involves a mixture of exercise inten-
sities. Golf can help persons and populations meet, and exceed
minimum

recommendations
for
Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity.36 37
Studies quantifying golf by Metabolic Equivalent of Task
(MET) value generally agree it offers moderate intensity aerobic
activity,36
38–46 although with a wide range of MET values
quoted (2.5–8.0) some studies classify it as low intensity47 48 or
high intensity.49 50 The mean of the range of estimates is 4.5
METs. Figure 5 shows MET values attributed to different

 modes of golf and, for comparison, other physical activities suit-
able for all ages, by the Compendium of Physical Activity.38

51–56 264–450 kcal/

61 steps, walking 4–8
miles,36 48 49 51 57 60 62 while those playing and riding a golf
cart accrue 6280 steps61 or just under 4 miles.51 There is poor
agreement in the literature assessing intensity of golf by heart
rate, with a majority classifying golf as low intensity,47 58 63–65
but others quantifying it as moderate to high intensity.36 57 66 67
Intensity of physical activity playing golf is higher for those
walking rather than riding a golf cart,51 58 59 65 68 those playing
a hillier course,55
67 older adults,66 heavier players,49
56
69
males36 and those of low baseline fitness. Intensity further
varies depending if a player is swinging a club, walking or
standing.69
Knowledge of the contribution of golf to muscle strengthen-
ing and to the balance aspects of physical activity recommenda-
tions is limited, and a priority for a review and further primary
research. Studies suggest that golf may improve proprioception,
balance, muscle endurance and function particularly in the
elderly,57 70–74 while in younger players, no increase in muscle
mass or bone mineral density has been seen.75
Sedentary behaviour is characterised as ‘any waking activity
characterised by an energy expenditure over 1.5 METs and a
sitting or reclining posture’.76 Time playing golf without riding
a golf cart is non-sedentary time,36 38–45 47–49 and although
golfers riding a golf cart do gain some health-enhancing physical
activity, golfers walking the course gain more.
Unlike most other sports, golf spectating offers the opportun-
ity to walk around the field of play, rather than being restricted
to a seat. Spectators from North America and South Korea have
highlighted ‘exercise’ as a reason for attending golf events,
which can attract in excess of 500 000 spectators per week.77–79
Golf and longevity
Physical inactivity is a determinant of excess mortality, killing
>3 million,5 and perhaps in excess of 5 million people annu-
ally.4 The 2010 Global Burden of Disease study highlights that
physical inactivity is one of the top five causes of death in
North America, W
estern Europe and in Australasia,5 three
regions where golf is frequently played.2
The best available evidence suggests that playing golf may con-
tribute to reduced mortality and increased life expectancy. When
a Swedish study compared 300 818 golfers to non-golfers, they
found a 40% lower mortality rate, although the study design and
limitations meant that this could not be directly attributed to
golf-related physical activity.80 The authors of that study speculate
that this corresponds to a 5-year increase in life expectancy
regardless of gender, age or socioeconomic status. This increase
will also have further contributing factors, including other life-
style factors. Playing sport several times per week is likely to
benefit health more than playing one to two times per week.81
An association, but not causal relationship, is demonstrated
between golf and life expectancy in Swedish and US studies.80 82
Golf and physical health
In providing moderate intensity physical activity, it is biologic-
ally plausible that golf could be expected to have beneficial
effects in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases,
including ischaemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and
colon and breast cancer.4 83 A review commissioned by the
W
orld Golf Foundation concluded that participating in golf can
‘yield a number of positive health and fitness effects’12 although
methods
were
not
stated
and
only
health
benefits
were
described. Frequent golfers perceive their physical health to be
better than infrequent golfers.84
Cardiovascular system
Golf is associated with improvements in known risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, including physical inactivity,38 blood

 lipid and insulin–glucose levels,57 66 85 body composition57 85
and aerobic fitness,57 although direct evidence and longitudinal
trials assessing the medium-term and long-term impact of golf
on coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease are lacking.
Golf is reported as providing suitable exercise for patients with
cardiac43 86 87 and stroke rehabilitation.88
Golf can provide a sufficient stimulus to improve aerobic
fitness, but higher intensity exercise generates significantly
improved
cardiovascular
adaption
compared
to
playing
golf.43 57 69 The effects of a season of golf on systolic blood
pressure showed no significant difference in a controlled trial,57
while no consistent effect has been found measuring blood pres-
sure during golf.64 67 86
There is an increased incidence of acute cardiac events during
participation in sport89 and golf in particular.90–92 Golf players
with new or unstable cardiac symptoms should consult a doctor.90
There is contradictory and inconclusive evidence regarding the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of automatic external defibrilla-
tors situated at golf courses.93–96 An extremely rare mechanism of
ischaemic stroke linked to golf has been described.97
Respiratory system
Regular participation in golf may improve lung function and
maintain it in older adults.69 98 Separate golf and swimming
interventions decreased hospital admission rates and symptom
severity, while improving quality of life and parent satisfaction
in a randomised trial of children with asthma.99
Metabolic health
Quasi-experimental studies are united in describing overall posi-
tive effects on lipid profile.53 57 67 85 Statistically significant
effects of a season of golf on body composition (body weight,
body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and some skinfold thick-
nesses) are described in controlled trials,57 85 while a smaller
study showed no effect on body composition.69 Blood glucose
levels decreased during golfing activity in Swedish and Japanese
studies.53 66
Cancer risk
An inverse relationship is demonstrated regarding physical activ-
ity and colon/breast cancer.4 Five ultraviolet radiation dosimetry
studies report exposures that place golfers at higher risk of skin
cancer than non-golfers.100–104 A cross-sectional study of female
professional and amateur golf players highlighted increased
numbers of non-melanoma skin cancers.105 Appropriate sun-
screen,
protective
clothing
and
shade
availability
are
suggested.100 106
Musculoskeletal health
Golf is associated with musculoskeletal benefits as well as acci-
dent
and
injury.
Older
golfers
may
gain
improved
balance,70 71 73 muscular function72 and strength74 compared to
controls, but no lower limb bone mineral density increase was
found in male professional golfers.75 Female caddies show
better bone health than the general female population.107 108
Golf and injury
Injuries and accidents related to golf comprise the largest group
of studies identified by the scoping review. A 2009 systematic
review and other reviews describe golf as overall a moderate
risk activity for injury compared to other sports.11 26
Prospective and retrospective epidemiological studies quote
the incidence of injury in amateur golfers annually to be between
15.8% and 40.9%109–114 and lifetime injury incidence between
25.2% and 67.4%.10
115–118 Prospective longitudinal studies
report very low injury rates compared to other sports, at 0.28–
0.60 injuries per 1000 hours in amateurs.57 109 119 Professionals
play more, and are injured more frequently, with annual injury
rates of between 31.0% and 90.0%,115 120 and quoted lifetime
incidence of 60.0–88.5%. Overall, the incidence of injury is
moderate, and the rate of injury per hour played is low.
The most frequent cause of injury in amateur and professional
golfers is volume of repetitive practice,113 114 116 117 121 while
suboptimal swing biomechanics are a frequent115–117 122 and
perhaps even leading109 cause in amateurs. Attention to these
factors, and to an adequate warm up,26 123–128 and physical
conditioning11 26 129 130 reduces risk of injury.
Regarding limb injuries, the lead side (the left arm and leg in
a right-handed golfer) is more often injured than the trail
(right side in a right-handed golfer).11 26 113 131 132 The mean
length of missed practice or competition quoted is 4.0–5.2
weeks.116

 account for the greatest overall incidence of injury in amateur
golfers (18.3–36.4%).109 115–117 133 The elbow (8.0–33.0%),
the wrist and hand (10.0–32%) and shoulder (4.0–18.6%) are

in
amateur
golfers.10 11 109 110 115–117 133
Golf is an infrequent cause of head and particularly ocular
injury, but these injuries can be severe particularly in chil-
dren.134–145 Injuries in children most often occur when struck
by a club,134 140–142 while adults are more frequently hit by a
ball. Most paediatric golf-related injuries occur away from a golf
course134 143 with authors urging preventative strategies target-
ing improved education and supervision of children and safe
storage of golf equipment.11 134 135 138 140
Although still infrequent, golf is reported to be the sport with
the highest incidence of lightning strike in the USA146 with
deaths,147 148 and prevention strategies for players and courses
outlined.147
Golf cart-related injuries, including from falls, collisions
or
limb
entrapment,
can
occur11
149
150
and
can
be
severe.139 149–152 The US National Safety Council reports over
15 000 golf cart-related injuries per year, noting that not all are
related to golf.149 Authors suggest regulation and instruction
around safe golf cart use,150 151 as well as improvement and
standardisation of safety features—for example, speed limiters,
seat belts and front wheel brakes.149 150
Golf and mental health/wellness
No consistent evidence for the associations or effects of golf on
mental illness was reported. Golf is associated with positive
impacts on mental wellness.35 153 154 A wide range of method-
ologies,
including
qualitative
interviewing,
cross-sectional
surveys and longitudinal studies, were used.
Mental health
A small experimental study enrolling nine persons with severe
and enduring mental illness tentatively reported a number of
mental and social benefits for participants.155 There is conflict-
ing evidence relating to the effect of golf and other sports on
mood and anxiety, with positive156 and negative62 mood
changes noted. Improvement in stress and anxiety was reported
by two studies156 157 highlighting stress-busting qualities, ver-
balised as a ‘sense of cool control’ and a ‘release of aggres-
sion’.157
Conversely,
studies
describe
anxieties
relating
to
performance on the golf course.62 157 Increased heart rates are
noted prior to tournament play, consistent with prematch
tension.86
Mental wellness
Quantitative and qualitative studies have described benefits
related to self and group identity157–161 and social connections,
many of which have been cultured long term.84 161 162 Golf
facilitated opportunities for intergenerational interaction,163 164
and created opportunities to rebuild social connections86 161
and confidence165 during and post illness.
Self-efficacy, self-worth and physical activity levels improved
after a golf intervention in 814 participants with a disability in
the USA.166 In addition, self-worth in golfing populations158 161
and self-esteem156
167 in sporting populations that include
golfers show positive change. An initial analysis of ‘The First
T
ee’—an at-scale US sport-based development programme—sug-
gests that participants and parents noted improved confidence,
interpersonal skills and emotional control.168 Finally, sunshine,
fresh air and kinaesthetic pleasure were identified through quali-
tative interview responses as contributing factors to potential
wellness162 benefits related to golf.

relating to golf
Comment
Why required
Mental health and illness
Physical activity has an overall positive impact on wellness and
mental ill health, but robust, controlled studies with objective
measures are required in relation to golf
Weight of evidence low
Systematic reviews relating to
golf and health
To explore cause and effect nature of the relationships described
Scoping review methods cannot answer these specific questions,
but have been able to map the evidence landscape and indicate
where more focused study is required
Muscle strengthening/strength
and balance/musculoskeletal
benefits
Research on the contribution of golf to muscle strengthening/
strength and balance, and potential effects in relation to
osteoporosis and osteoarthritis could be important to golfers,
practitioners and policymakers looking to provide advice to patients
and populations
Weight of evidence low/knowledge gap
Golf carts
Research is needed exploring how health effects/relationships differ
between golf played while riding a golf cart and golf played walking
the course
Weight of evidence low
Spectating
Research assessing useful physical activity accrued spectating is
required. Opportunities exist to shape health behaviours among
spectators on course and in daily life using the experience as a
‘teachable moment’
Knowledge gap
Health behaviour change
Research is needed addressing how golfers and potential golfers can
be influenced to take part and maintain golfing activity, and
investigating and improving knowledge and behaviours related to
golf injuries, illnesses and accidents
Weight of evidence low
Economic effects
Research investigating cost savings to health and other services
associated with golf, and opportunities to make golf more accessible
and affordable for all will inform policy
Weight of evidence low
Specific populations
Research addressing associations between golf and health in (1)
disabled and (2) older adult populations may highlight specific
benefits/disbenefits
Weight of evidence low

 In summary, a number of qualitative and quantitative studies
describe improved wellness in golfers, but there are few con-
trolled studies looking at golf and mental health.
Further research priorities
This study has identified research gaps in the existing literature
on golf and health with future research priorities outlined in
table 2.
Limitations
Scoping reviews are comprehensive, but not exhaustive in iden-
tifying literature16 recognising the balance between the breadth
and depth of analysis.169 Our search was subject to older but
relevant sources being less available via databases, search plat-
forms and search engines. Scoping reviews are broad in nature
and provide an overview of existing literature regardless of
quality, providing a broader and more contextual overview than
systematic reviews. Formal assessment of methodological quality
is not undertaken when conducting a scoping review,14 15 169
and synthesis of the literature quantitatively, nor demonstration
of a cause and effect nature for the found relationships is not
possible. Golfers are likely different to non-golfers in many
ways, with confounding factors a challenge to identify and
adequately control. Documented attempts were made through-
out the design and conduct of this study to appraise and report
evidence in an objective way.17 Rigorous and reproducible
methods have been applied and authors are committed to
publish all findings whether findings were positive, negative or
not significant.
CONCLUSIONS
This scoping review identified over 300 studies investigating the
relationship between golf and health. Golf has been shown to
provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity and therefore
could be expected to have the same beneficial effects on longev-
ity, physical health, mental health and wellness associated with
physical activity.170 The scoping review cannot demonstrate
causative effects, but reports evidence that is biologically plaus-
ible and relatively consistent, highlighting positive associations
between golf and physical health, and mental wellness. The best
available evidence suggests that golf may contribute to reduced
mortality. The existing evidence supports efforts to promote golf
as a sport with overall health benefits. To maximise health bene-
fits, golfers should walk the course rather than riding a golf cart.
Research assessing golf’s contribution to muscle strengthening
recommendations, the relationships of golf on mental health,
golf spectating and health, and the influencing of health beha-
viours in golfers, have been identified as priorities for further
study. Systematic reviews to further explore health effects of
golf on specific conditions are also required.

What is known?
▸ Scoping reviews provide a useful framework to collate and
summarise information on a broad topic.
▸ Golf is played by over 50 million people of all ages
worldwide.
What this study adds?
▸ Playing golf can provide moderate intensity physical activity
and has overall positive associations with physical health
and mental wellness, while golf may contribute to increased
longevity.
▸ Disbenefits include (mostly overuse) injuries; accidents are
rare, but deleterious consequences of them can be high.
▸ Priority areas for future research include the associations
and effects of golf on mental health, golf’s contribution to
muscle strengthening, balance and falls prevention, and
influencing health behaviours among golfers and potential
golfers. Systematic reviews to further explore the cause and
effect nature of the relationships described are merited.
