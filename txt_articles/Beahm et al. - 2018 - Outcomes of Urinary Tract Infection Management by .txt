Introduction
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common con-
dition that often results in the initiation of anti-
bacterial therapy.1-3 It is also the eighth most 
common reason for ambulatory clinic visits 
and the fifth most common reason for emer-
gency department visits in Canada.4,5 UTI is a 
leading cause of inappropriate antimicrobial 
There is limited evidence 
on the outcomes of 
pharmacists assessing and 
managing urinary tract 
infections. We undertook 
this research to address 
this gap in the literature.

AbstrAct
Background: Pharmacists have the authoriza-
tion to prescribe medications for the treatment 
of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UtI) in 
some provinces. However, there are limited data 
on the outcomes of this care by pharmacists. Our 
objective was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety 
and patient satisfaction with pharmacist prescrib-
ing and care in patients with uncomplicated UtI. 
Methods: We conducted a prospective registry 
trial in 39 community pharmacies in the canadian 
province of New brunswick. Adult patients were 
enrolled if they presented to the pharmacy with 
either symptoms of UtI with no current antibac-
terial treatment (Pharmacist-Initial Arm) or if they 
presented with a prescription for an antibacterial 
to treat UtI from another health care provider 
(Physician-Initial Arm). Pharmacists assessed 
patients and if they had complicating factors or 
red flags for systemic illness or pyelonephritis, 
they were excluded from the study. Pharmacists 
either prescribed antibacterial therapy, modified 
antibacterial therapy, provided education only or 
referred to physician, as appropriate. the primary 
outcome was clinical cure at 2 weeks and the sec-
ondary outcomes included adverse events and 
patient satisfaction. 
Results: A total of 750 patients were enrolled (87.4% 
in the Pharmacist-Initial Arm), average age was 40.9 
(sD 16.0) years. clinical cure was achieved in 88.9% 
of patients. Of those that did not have sustained 
symptom resolution, most (5.5% overall) had symp-
tom recurrence after completion of therapy. Adverse 
events were reported by 7.2% of patients and 88.9% 
of those continued their medication. Most adverse 
events were gastrointestinal-related and transient. 
the patient satisfaction survey reflected very high 
levels of satisfaction for the care they received, as 
well as for trust and accessibility of the pharmacist. 
Conclusion: Pharmacist management of uncomplicated UtI is effective, safe, and patient satisfaction 
appears very high. Can Pharm J (Ott) 2018;151:305-314.

prescription, frequently leading to both direct 
antimicrobial adverse events and secondary 
complications, including infection with Clos-
tridium difficile.3,6,7 The incidence of UTI in 
women is 12% annually, with 50% of women 
reporting to have had a UTI by 32 years of age.2 
Recurrence of infection occurs in 25% of women 
within 6 months of the first UTI, and this rate 
increases when more than one prior UTI has 
been experienced.2
Pharmacists are accessible primary health care 
professionals who are well positioned to take on a 
larger role in the management of UTI. The ability 
of pharmacists to prescribe for UTI varies in Can-
ada from province to province, with New Bruns-
wick,8 Quebec,9 Saskatchewan10 and Alberta11 all 
allowing pharmacists to prescribe for this indica-
tion, to varying extents. Regardless of the prov-
ince or setting in which pharmacists practise, 
there are several ways that pharmacists can get 
actively involved in the management of patients 
with UTIs.12 However, there is a paucity of stud-
ies on the impact of pharmacist management of 
UTI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
effectiveness and safety of, and patient satisfaction 
with, pharmacist assessment and management of 
patients with uncomplicated UTI.

Original research 
Brunswick. Pharmacists in New Brunswick have 
the authority to prescribe for uncomplicated UTI. 
The study was designed to be pragmatic, captur-
ing data that are reflective of real-world practice 
while integrating into the pharmacists’ workflow.
Study population
Patients were included in the study if they were 
at least 19 years of age and either 1) presented to 
the pharmacy with symptoms suggestive of UTI 
without a current prescription to treat it from 
another health care provider (Pharmacist-Initial 
Arm) or 2) presented with a new prescription 
for the treatment of UTI from another health 
care provider (Physician-Initial Arm). There was 
no cap on the number of patients who could be 
enrolled per arm. Patients were excluded if they 
had signs or symptoms suggestive of pyelone-
phritis or systemic illness, the presence of compli-
cating factors and if receiving an antibacterial for 
UTI prophylaxis. Complicating factors included 
male sex, pregnancy, indwelling urinary catheter, 
poorly controlled diabetes, chronic obstruction, 
nephrolithiasis, chronic renal insufficiency and 
immunosuppression. “Red flags” for pyelone-
phritis or systemic illness included flank pain or 
tenderness, fever (≥38°C), rigors, significant nau-
sea or vomiting, and frank hematuria. Patients 
were also excluded if it was their second or more 
recurrence of symptomatic UTI in the past 30 
days. Pharmacists obtained informed consent 
from patients for study participation and collec-
tion of data before enrolling them in the study. 
At the time of the study, pharmacist assessments 
were not provincially funded services. Pharma-
cist assessment fees were reimbursed to pharma-
cies from the study budget to allow them to waive 
their pharmacist assessment fees for participat-
ing patients to enhance study enrollment.
Study intervention
The study intervention was based on recently 
published pharmacist guidelines for the manage-
ment of UTI.12 Pharmacists performed patient 
assessments for symptoms of UTI and prescribed 
antibacterial therapy, modified antibacterial 
therapy, provided education only or referred to 
physician, as appropriate. The preferred anti-
bacterial regimen was nitrofurantoin monohy-
drate/macrocrystals 100 mg taken twice daily 
for 5 days. Alternative first-line options included 
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 800-160 mg 
twice daily for 3 days, fosfomycin 3 g single dose 
and cefuroxime axetil 500 mg twice daily for 7 
days. Education was provided to all patients and 
included information on what to expect and 
instructions to come back if symptoms were not 
improving or worsening after a few days. Phar-
macists conducted follow-ups with included 
patients at 2 weeks to assess for resolution of 
symptoms, adherence to therapy and any adverse 
events. Additional follow-ups were permitted, if 
necessary. Those failing to achieve clinical resolu-
tion at 2 weeks were again assessed for evidence 
of complication and provided with a modified 
treatment plan or physician referral, depending 
on the pharmacist’s findings.
Study outcomes
The primary outcome was clinical cure (i.e., 
symptom resolution) at 2 weeks. Secondary out-
comes included adverse events, patient adher-
ence to therapy, number of follow-ups, treatment 
failures (and reasons for), time from decision to 
seek care until seen by pharmacist (Pharmacist-
Initial Arm) or physician (Physician-Initial 
Arm) and patient satisfaction. Patient satisfac-
tion was collected using a survey that has been 
used previously to gauge satisfaction in other 
general pharmacist prescribing activities,13,14 
with slight modification.
Statistical analyses
We estimated that with a 95% confidence level 
and a 5% margin of error, the sample size required 
would be 384 patients. This number was inflated 
to 500 to allow for 20% loss to follow-up and was 
further increased to 750 for added power in the 
analyses of secondary outcomes.
The primary outcome for efficacy was com-
pared to our hypothesis of 90% clinical cure

using the chi-squared test. Between-arm com-
parisons were conducted using the chi-squared 
test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, 
as appropriate, and t-test was used for continu-
ous variables. When data deviated from normal-
ity, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used.
Data collection/management
Data were entered by the pharmacists into a secure, 
centralized, web-based database that was designed 
and maintained by the EPICORE Centre, Uni-
versity of Alberta. The database was designed as a 
practice tool and was intended to have data entered 
in real time while the pharmacist is with the 
patient. Pharmacists were able to print off a single-
page documentation note that self-populated from 
the data that were entered into the database. This 
documentation note was sent to the patient’s most 
responsible physician for all pharmacist assess-
ments and could also be scanned into the patient’s 
file on the pharmacy computer system. The satis-
faction surveys were emailed to patients directly 
from the data management system following their 
baseline visit. For the few patients who did not 
have email access, paper surveys were mailed to the 
patient with a prepaid return envelope in which the 
patients mailed the surveys back to the EPICORE 
Centre to be manually entered into the database. 
Study pharmacists did not have access to the satis-
faction survey results.
Ethics
The study was approved by the Health Research 
Ethics Boards of the University of Alberta 
(Pro00072493) and the Horizon Health Net-
work (New Brunswick) (RS 2017-2443). The 
study was also registered on Clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT03184818).
Results
From June 2017 to April 2018, there were 818 
patients assessed, of whom 750 met the study 
inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Of those, 87.5% 
were Pharmacist-Initial Arm patients. Baseline 
characteristics of included patients are depicted 
in Table 1. The average age was 40.9 (standard 
deviation [SD], 16.0) years, and the 2 most 
common presenting symptoms were new or 
increased urinary frequency and dysuria. The 
time from decision to seek care to accessing a 
pharmacist was 1.7 (SD 2.4) days compared to 
2.8 (SD 3.8) days for a physician (p = 0.0153). Of 
the enrolled patients who received a prescription 
from a physician first, pharmacists modified 
40.4% of those initial prescriptions.
Of the 750 patients enrolled, 686 (91.5%) com-
pleted the 2-week follow-up. The average num-
ber of follow-ups per patient was 1.1 (SD 0.2). 
At 2-week follow-up, 88.9% had sustained symp-
tomatic resolution (i.e., clinical cure) (Table 2). Of 
those who did not have sustained resolution of 
symptoms at 2 weeks, 51.3% (5.5% overall) expe-
rienced an initial resolution of symptoms but had 
recurrence of symptoms after completion of ther-
apy (i.e., early recurrence of infection). Therefore, 
initial cure was achieved in 94.5% of patients (p = 
0.0025), but 5.5% had early recurrence of infec-
tion, leading to the sustained clinical cure rate of 
88.9%, which was not significantly different from 
our a priori hypothesis of 90%.
Adverse events were reported by 7.2% of 
patients (Table 3). Of these, 88.9% were still able 
to complete their course of medication. Most 
adverse events were gastrointestinal-related 
(59.3% of those reported) and transient. The 
next most commonly reported adverse events 
were secondary vaginal infections (14.8% of 
those reported) (e.g., vaginal candidiasis). A 
total of 5 (0.7%) reported adverse events resulted 
in a physician or emergency department visit 
 
(3 in the Pharmacist-Initial Arm and 2 in the 
Physician-Initial Arm).
Most patients (96.5%) took their medica-
tion as prescribed (Table 4). Of the reasons for 
treatment failure, 6 (0.9% overall) were due 
to complications (Table 5), of which 2 were 
pyelonephritis. Treatment failure was possi-
bly influenced by adherence in 6.8% of fail-
ures (0.7% overall), with 5 patients who either 
missed 50% or more of their doses or did not 
take them at all with subsequent treatment 
failure (Table 6).
The responses to the patient satisfaction 
survey are depicted in Figure 2. The survey 
was completed by 398 of the enrolled patients 
(53.1%). Generally, patients felt that the pharma-
cists’ assessments were thorough and they were 
very satisfied with the care they received. They 
also expressed a high level of trust in their phar-
macist, as well as an appreciation of the acces-
sibility of their pharmacist.
Discussion
UTI is an acute condition that is common and 
very often produces symptoms that are unpleas-
ant and result in restricted activities.15 It is also

a common reason for antibacterial use (and mis-
use). The RxOUTMAP study is the first compre-
hensive evaluation of community pharmacist 
assessment and management, including pre-
scribing, for uncomplicated UTI. We found that 
pharmacist management of UTI was highly effi-
cacious and safe. Importantly, we also found that 
patient satisfaction with this clinical service was 
very high, especially in the areas of thorough-
ness of the assessment, accessibility and trust in 
the care provided by their pharmacists.
Our findings are consistent with previous 
work in this area. One Scottish study of pharmacist-
directed UTI care reported time to symptom 
resolution to be ≤2 days in 49%, between 3 and 5 
days for 34% and unresolved (at 7 days) in 15%, 
with no difference in these frequencies between 
pharmacist-initiated 
and 
physician-initiated 
arms (note: pharmacists did not modify treat-
ment from physicians in this study).16 They 
also found that, of the few patients who were 
followed up, 22% (4 patients overall) from the 
pharmacist-initiated arm planned to seek phy-
sician consultation after receiving the pharmacy 
service; however, they make no mention of how 
many from the physician-initiated arm planned 
to go back to the physician. This study was lim-
ited by small sample size (153) and high loss 
to follow-up (30%). Our study provides more 
robust data on the efficacy and safety of phar-
macists prescribing for uncomplicated UTI. We 
also demonstrated that pharmacists are able 
to identify complicating factors and red flags 
for pyelonephritis or systemic illness and refer

these patients, when necessary. Another recent 
report of pharmacist prescribing in Scotland 
for UTI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
and impetigo surveyed patients who received 
these services.17 Of the 797 patients who used 
those services during the study survey period, 
73 (9%) responded, the majority of whom (61) 
received treatment of UTI. The responses from 
that survey showed high levels of satisfaction 
with the care provided by pharmacists and that 
this was related to the quicker and more efficient 
access to treatment. This was also reflected in 
our study’s patient satisfaction survey, through 
which patients expressed very high levels of sat-
isfaction for the care they received.
Several clinical implications can be inferred 
from this study. One important implication is 
accessibility. The time from deciding to seek 
care to accessing a pharmacist was signifi-
cantly shorter than accessing a physician by 1

day. Given the increasing constraints on urgent 
care clinics and emergency rooms, this option 
provides patients with an alternative assess-
ment pathway for a common medical condition. 
Although the accessibility of community phar-
macists is well known,18 coupling this with the 
high efficacy and safety data, as well as the very 
high level of patient satisfaction, should help to 
justify the expansion of pharmacists’ prescribing 
authority for UTI in other jurisdictions.
Several potential limitations to this study 
warrant discussion. First, the study lacked a 
comparator group. Although it is common for 
contemporary pharmacy practice research stud-
ies to have a “usual care” group as their compara-
tor,19,20 this would not have been feasible for this

Original research 
study because of the acute nature of the illness 
(i.e., it would not have been ethical to withhold 
pharmacist management). We instead compared 
our primary outcome to our hypothesized clinical 
cure rate of 90%, which was derived from pub-
lished data on rates of cure in studies of the treat-
ment of uncomplicated UTI.1 Another potential 
limitation is that several aspects of this study 
relied on the patients’ subjective description and 
recollection of symptoms. More objective tests, 
such as a urinalysis (or urine dipstick) for pyuria 
or a urine culture, could have been an option; 
however, neither pyuria nor a positive urine cul-
ture in the absence of symptoms would be indica-
tive of infection, and if those tests were negative 
in conjunction with the presence of typical symp-
toms of UTI, then treatment would usually still be 
indicated. It is generally accepted clinical practice 
that urine culture confirmation is not necessary 
for most cases of uncomplicated UTI2,12,21 and 
pyuria is more useful for its negative predictive 
value in the elderly, but this negative predictive 
value is much lower in younger patients.2,12,21,22 
Because of these considerations and the fact that 
this study was intended to be pragmatic, these 
tests were not required. Also, the high rate of clin-
ical resolution observed in the study further sup-
ports management without adjunctive laboratory 
testing for cases of uncomplicated UTI. Another 
potential limitation is that loss to follow-up was 
relatively moderate at 8.5%. However, the loss 
to follow-up is not completely unexpected for a 
pragmatic, practice-based trial, as follow-up is 
very rarely complete in real-world practice, espe-
cially for acute conditions such as UTI. It could 
also be argued that designing the study to capture 
real-world data is actually a strength. The patient 
satisfaction survey response rate of 53.1% could 
be considered low-moderate. However, there is 
little consensus as to what constitutes an accept-
able survey response rate and some evidence to 
suggest that surveys with lower response rates 
very often carry comparable accuracy to that of 
surveys with larger response rates.23 As an acute 
condition, it is also possible that patients felt less 
impetus to respond once they no longer required 
care, as compared to a chronic condition in which 
care would be ongoing.
Our findings demonstrate that the manage-
ment of uncomplicated UTI by pharmacists 
is effective and safe and that patients express 
a high level of satisfaction with this care. One 
could postulate that this care by pharmacists is 
a cost-effective health delivery solution that can 
make the health care system more efficient—
the planned future analyses of these results will 
include an economic analysis to further evaluate 
this notion. In addition, further review of these 
results will evaluate antimicrobial utilization and 
antimicrobial stewardship implications. ■
