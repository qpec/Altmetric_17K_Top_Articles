Modeling Contagion Through Social Networks to Explain
and Predict Gunshot Violence in Chicago, 2006 to 2014
Ben Green, MSc; Thibaut Horel, MSc; Andrew V. Papachristos, PhD
IMPORTANCE Every day in the United States, more than 200 people are murdered or
assaulted with a firearm. Little research has considered the role of interpersonal ties in the
pathways through which gun violence spreads.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the extent to which the people who will become subjects of gun
violence can be predicted by modeling gun violence as an epidemic that is transmitted
between individuals through social interactions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was an epidemiological analysis of a social
network of individuals who were arrested during an 8-year period in Chicago, Illinois, with
connections between people who were arrested together for the same offense. Modeling of
the spread of gunshot violence over the network was assessed using a probabilistic contagion
model that assumed individuals were subject to risks associated with being arrested together,
in addition to demographic factors, such as age, sex, and neighborhood residence.
Participants represented a network of 138 163 individuals who were arrested between
January 1, 2006, and March 31, 2014 (29.9% of all individuals arrested in Chicago during this
period), 9773 of whom were subjects of gun violence. Individuals were on average 27 years
old at the midpoint of the study, predominantly male (82.0%) and black (75.6%), and often
members of a gang (26.2%).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Explanation and prediction of becoming a subject of gun
violence (fatal or nonfatal) using epidemic models based on person-to-person transmission
through a social network.
RESULTS Social contagion accounted for 63.1% of the 11 123 gunshot violence episodes;
subjects of gun violence were shot on average 125 days after their infector (the person most
responsible for exposing the subject to gunshot violence). Some subjects of gun violence
were shot more than once. Models based on both social contagion and demographics
performed best; when determining the 1.0% of people (n = 1382) considered at highest risk
to be shot each day, the combined model identified 728 subjects of gun violence (6.5%)
compared with 475 subjects of gun violence (4.3%) for the demographics model (53.3%
increase) and 589 subjects of gun violence (5.3%) for the social contagion model (23.6%
increase).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Gunshot violence follows an epidemic-like process of social
contagion that is transmitted through networks of people by social interactions. Violence
prevention efforts that account for social contagion, in addition to demographics, have the
potential to prevent more shootings than efforts that focus on only demographics.

I
n 2014, a total of 10 945 people in the United States were
murdered with a firearm, and approximately 65 106 oth-
ers were injured in nonfatal gun assaults (an average of
more than 200 fatal and nonfatal subjects of gun violence per
day).1 Although mass shootings are often the focus of public
attention, most gun murders and assaults occur in everyday
incidents involving a small number of people (typically 2
individuals).2 Furthermore, gun violence tends to concen-
trate within socially and economically disadvantaged minor-
ity urban communities, where rates of gunshot injuries far ex-
ceed the national average3,4 and where young black men
experience rates of gun homicide 10 times higher than their
white counterparts.2
The media, politicians, and academics alike often de-
scribe gun violence in the United States as an “epidemic,”2,5-9
implying concern over its alarmingly high levels, as well as the
possibility of its spread. Although gun violence’
s stubborn per-
sistence in certain communities might be more accurately de-
scribed as an endemic,6 the public emphasis on epidemics has
inspired research on the mechanisms through which vio-
lence might be transmitted.9-11 The most common approach
measures the spatial diffusion of gun violence from neighbor-
hood to neighborhood.3,9,11,12 Although this spatial approach
often discusses interpersonal relationships related to gang
activity9,13 or drug markets14 as the drivers behind the diffu-
sion of gun violence, the statistical models presume that vio-
lence might be conceptualized as an airborne pathogen (eg, in-
fluenza) moving between neighborhoods, which can be
“caught” by inhabiting locations with high incidence rates.
However, recent thinking suggests that many of the pro-
cesses that we attribute to geography might occur in part be-
causeoftheinterpersonaltiesunderlyingsocialnetworks15(see
the Glossary in the eText in the Supplement for definitions of
social network and other technical terms used in this article).
Research on gun violence in Chicago, Illinois, Boston, Massa-
chusetts, and Newark, New Jersey, has found that subjects of
gun violence are concentrated within networks, along with
cross-sectional evidence that such concentration is related to
social contagion (ie, the spread of beliefs, attitudes, and be-
haviors through social interactions).10,16-18 Furthermore, so-
cial networks are fundamental in diffusion processes related
to diverse areas, such as behaviors,19 opinions,20,21 human im-
munodeficiency virus (HIV),22 obesity,23 and depression.24
Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that the
diffusion of gun violence might occur through person-to-
person interactions, in a process akin to the epidemiological
transmission of a blood-borne pathogen (eg, HIV). Contagion
via social ties, then, may be a critical mechanism in explain-
ing why neighborhoods matter when modeling the diffusion
of crime and, perhaps more important, why certain individu-
als become subjects of gun violence while others exposed to
the same high-risk environments do not.
To study the role of social influence in gun violence, we
examinedaparticularinteractionbetweenindividuals,namely,
beingarrestedtogetherforthesameoffense,abehaviorknown
asco-offending.Co-offendingtypicallyoccursbetweenpeople
who share strong preexisting social ties25 and is driven by so-
cial processes that amplify risky behaviors (criminal or delin-
quent acts that might lead to arrest, including violent epi-
sodes and offending).25-29 Like other social behaviors, such as
needle sharing30 and sex,22,31 co-offending may reveal pat-
terns of social interactions that influence how gun violence
spreads.25,27,32-34 We postulated that a person becomes ex-
posed to gun violence through social interactions with previ-
ous subjects of gun violence: someone who has been shot may
be more likely to be embedded in the networks and environ-
ments in which guns are present and gun violence is likely to
erupt.Therefore,associatingwithsubjectsofgunviolence,and
specifically co-engaging in risky behaviors with them, may ex-
pose individuals to these same behaviors, situations, and
people that in turn increase the probability of becoming a sub-
ject of gun violence.
Our study directly assessed the efficacy of treating the dif-
fusion of gunshot violence as an epidemiological process that
spreads through social networks. Our central hypothesis was
that, when someone in your network becomes a subject of gun
violence, your risk of becoming a subject of gun violence tem-
porarily increases. We hypothesized that predictive models in-
corporating social contagion would outperform models con-
sideringonlyindividualandecologicalriskfactorsinpredicting
future gunshot subjects. Modeling the precise social dynam-
ics of gun violence could represent an important advance in
treating gun violence as a public health epidemic. By identi-
fying high-risk individuals and transmission pathways that
might not be detected by other means, a contagion-based ap-
proach could detect strategic points of intervention that would
enable measures to proactively reduce the trauma associated
with gun violence rather than just react to past incidents. Most
important, such a contagion-based approach is centered on
subjectsofgunviolenceand,assuch,hasthepotentialtomove
the larger public dialogue on gun violence away from efforts
that rest largely on geographic or group-based policing
efforts that tend to disproportionately affect disadvantaged
minority communities.
We tested our hypothesis in Chicago, a city whose well-
documented patterns of gun violence are emblematic of the
epidemic described above and whose rates of gun violence are
more than 3 times the national average (eText and eFigures 1,
2, and 3 in the Supplement).15,35-39 Although Chicago does not
Key Points
Question Does gun violence spread over social networks through
a process of social contagion?
Findings An epidemiological analysis of a network of 138 163
individuals in Chicago, Illinois, determined that social contagion
was responsible for 63.1% of the 11 123 gunshot violence episodes
that occurred between 2006 and 2014. Models incorporating
social contagion and demographics (eg, age, sex, and
neighborhood residence) predicted future gunshot subjects better
than models based on social contagion or demographics alone.
Meaning Violence prevention efforts that account for social
contagion, in addition to demographics, have the potential to
prevent more shootings than efforts that focus only on
demographics.

ber of homicides than any other city in the United States.40
As in other major US cities, violent gun crime in Chicago
isintenselyconcentratedinasmallnumberofsociallyandeco-
nomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (where homicide
rates can be upward of 75 per 100 000 people).36,37,41 Further-
more, gun violence is concentrated in small social networks:
a recent study10 by one of us (A.V.P.) of nonfatal gunshot vio-
lence episodes in Chicago from 2006 to 2014 found that more
than 70% of all subjects of gun violence could be located in
networks containing less than 5% of the city’
s population. The
present study examines the extent to which being shot in
Chicago might be explained as a process of epidemiological
transmission between individuals in these networks.
Methods
Data
We examined all recorded fatal and nonfatal gunshot injuries
in Chicago from 2006 to 2014 among the population of indi-
viduals arrested during this period. Data are from 2 different
sources provided by the Chicago Police Department through
a nondisclosure agreement (and approved by the Yale Insti-
tutional Review Board). These data were considered exempt
by the institutional review board because they were second-
ary deidentified information provided for the study, and in-
formed consent was not necessary. The first source was all
1 189 225 arrests recorded by the police between January 1,
2006, and March 31, 2014, involving 462 516 people (for com-
parison, the adult population of Chicago totals approxi-
mately2.1million).Arrestdataarerecordedattheincidentlevel
and contain social and demographic information on each re-
ported individual, including birth date, race, sex, and gang
membership (as identified by the police).
The second source was detailed records for all 16 399 gun-
shot violence episodes recorded by the police during the same
period, excluding suicides, accidents, and shootings that oc-
curred during legal interventions (ie, shootings involving law
enforcement personnel). These records consist of 13 877 non-
fatal and 2522 fatal shootings, affecting 14 695 people; 1498
people were shot on more than 1 occasion. Among all shoot-
ing subjects, 90.2% were arrested during the study period and
could be identified in the arrest data.
Co-offending Network
Figure 1 shows how the co-offending network was created. We
generated a social network from the data by identifying all
unique individuals arrested during the study period and con-
necting them via “edges,
” that is, a relationship between pairs
of individuals defined by being arrested together for the same
offense (a behavior known as co-offending) at least once dur-
ing the study period (section 2 of the eMethods in the Supple-
ment). This network contained 462 516 individuals, 467 506
edges, and 13 252 subjects of gun violence. Because co-
offending typically occurs between individuals who share pre-
existing social ties,25 co-arrests represent an association be-
tween 2 people but not the date at which this relationship
formed. Therefore, we developed a static network with edges
between every pair of individuals who had been arrested to-
gether at any time during the study period.
We restricted our analysis to the network’
s largest con-
nected component, which contained 29.9% of all arrested in-
dividuals (n = 138 163) and 89.3% of all the co-offending edges
(n = 417 635). Consistent with previous research on the con-
centration of gun violence within co-offending networks,10
the largest connected component contained 74.5% of gun-
shot violence episodes of arrested individuals (11 123 vio-
lence episodes, affecting 9773 people). We henceforth refer to
this component as the network.
Social Contagion Model
We modeled the contagion of violence over the network using
a stochastic model in which the probability of future shoot-
ings depended on the history of past shootings.11,42-45 Indi-
viduals are susceptible to gunshot violence through the fol-
lowing 2 means: (1) social contagion, reflecting the increased
probability to be shot immediately after a person with whom
one associates has been shot, and (2) a seasonal factor that re-
flects the persistent rate of violence episodes within the net-
work. The model expressed the social contagion component
of susceptibility via 2 factors, namely, time and network struc-
ture (section 4 of the eMethods and eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment). Consistent with previous models and epidemiological
research,weassumedthatgunviolenceismostlikelytospread
immediately after another shooting44-46 and between people
who are closely linked in the network.47,48 Regarding this lat-
ter point, we set the influence of contagion to weaken farther
away from the source according to the inverse square of net-
work distance and to disappear beyond 3 degrees of separa-
tion (ie, >3 edges away in the network).10,23

Using variables calibrated on the observed data, our model
calculated each person’
s exposure to gun violence based on
the aggregate influence of social contagion and seasonal fac-
tors (section 4 of the eMethods and eFigures 5 and 6 in the
Supplement). For each gunshot subject who was influenced
primarily by contagion, we identified which peer (the infec-
tor) was most responsible for causing him or her to become in-
fected (ie, a subject of gun violence). We then connected these
infections from infector to subject of gun violence to trace cas-
cades of gunshot violence episodes through the network (ie,
chains in which one person becomes infected, exposing his or
her associates, who then may become infected and spread the
infection to their associates, etc) (section 4 of the eMethods
in the Supplement). It is important to note that the infector is
not assumed to be the person who shoots the subject of gun
violence but rather the one who exposes him or her to the risk
of gun violence.
Model Evaluation for Predicting Subjects of Gun Violence
An important application of modeling gun violence is to iden-
tify who might be shot in the future: predicting gunshot sub-
jects might provide information that can be used for interven-
tion and violence prevention efforts, especially if we could
precisely identify a small population that faces the most im-
mediate risk. Therefore, we applied our model to predict who
would be shot. We compared the model described above (re-
ferred to henceforth as the social contagion model) with 2 oth-
ers. The first model was a demographics model that assumes
becomingasubjectofgunviolenceisdeterminedbytraits,such
as age, sex, and neighborhood residence, and correspond-
ingly predicts future subjects of gun violence based on demo-
graphic similarities to previous subjects of gun violence. This
model approximated traditional risk factor theories of gun vio-
lence. The second model combined the social contagion and
demographics models in a weighted average (with weights
found by optimizing over all possible linear combinations) to
account for both potential explanations of gun violence.
For every day of the study period, based on the data up to
that day, we calculated the risk of every person in the net-
work to be shot according to each model and selected the high-
est-risk individuals identified by each (section 5 of the
eMethods in the Supplement). We defined 3 high-risk popu-
lations as those people identified with the top 0.1% (n = 138),
0.5% (n = 691), and 1.0% (n = 1382) of risk to be shot on a given
day. Although larger populations of high-risk individuals could
potentially include more subjects of gun violence, larger popu-
lations could also include too many people to be reasonably
suited for targeted interventions. We evaluated and ranked our
models based on the number of subjects of gun violence they
identified within these high-risk populations. To evaluate the
reliability of the models, we performed tests on simulated data
for which we knew the true variable values and showed that
for the duration of our study period the method could accu-
rately estimate the variables within 12.7% (section 4 of the
eMethods and eFigure 6 in the Supplement).

Characteristics of the Network
The Table lists characteristics of the 138 163 individuals in the
network. Figure 2 shows a graphical representation of the net-
work, illustrating the relative locations of subjects of gun vio-
lence and those who were not. Individuals were on average 27
years old at the midpoint (in 2010) of the study and predomi-
nantly male (82.0%) and black (75.6%). According to police es-
timates, 26.2% were members of street gangs. Compared with
those who were not subjects of gun violence, the subjects of
gunshots were 3.8 years younger (23.2 vs 27.0 years) and more
likely to be male (97.0% vs 80.9%), black (79.8% vs 75.3%), and
involved in a gang (52.3% vs 24.3%). Consistent with prior
research,10 subjects of gunshot violence were concentrated
within the network. Gunshot subjects were socially close to
other gunshot subjects in the network: 17.9% of first-degree

associates of subjects of gun violence were also subjects com-
pared with 9.8% for subjects who were not. This pattern was
similar for second-degree and third-degree associates as well
(Table), indicating that there were clusters in the network with
many subjects of gun violence and other parts with few sub-
jects of gun violence.
To analyze the concentration of subjects of gun violence
within the network, we sought to distinguish between 3 po-
tentialexplanations,namely,homophily,confounding,andso-
cial contagion.49-52 Homophily is when individuals associate
with similar people, confounding occurs when individuals are
exposed to the same environmental factors, and social con-
tagion refers to individuals influencing one another’
s behav-
ior; homophily and confounding can generate situations that
appear to be due to social contagion. To explore the ability of
homophilyandconfoundingtogeneratetheobserveddata,we
performedsimulationexperimentsbasedondemographicsand
the dates of violence episodes. The results of these experi-
ments suggested that homophily and confounding were in-
sufficient explanations for the data, leaving social contagion
as a more likely explanation (section 3 of the eMethods and
eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
Modeling Contagion
After calibrating our model to the data, we found that 63.1%
(n = 7016) of the 11 123 gunshot violence episodes in the net-
work during the study period were attributable to social con-
tagion (section 4 of the eMethods and eFigure 8 in the Supple-
ment). In total, 60.8% of fatal violence episodes and 62.6% of
nonfatal violence episodes were attributable to social conta-
gion. Subjects of gun violence were shot on average 125 days
after their infector (the person most responsible for exposing
the subject to gunshot violence), with a median time differ-
ence of 83 days. From tracing gunshot violence episodes
throughthenetwork,wedetected4107separatecascades(con-
nectedchainsofinfectionthroughthenetwork),ranginginsize
from cascades with a single subject to a cascade involving 469
subjects, with 680 cascades involving multiple subjects and
a mean cascade size of 2.7 subjects (eFigure 9 in the Supple-
ment). Figure 3 shows 3 representative cascades, containing
12 people, 34 people, and 64 people, all shot during the study
period, and illustrating the pathways of diffusion between in-
dividuals. These cascades visually reinforce how gunshot vio-
lence spreads through a co-offending network, connecting in-
dividuals who initially may have had no connections to one
another. They also help to explain the concentration of sub-
jects of gun violence, as summarized in the Table and Figure 2,
because violence episodes in one part of the network gener-
ate further violence episodes in that same region.

ics, a model based on social contagion, and a model based on
both social contagion and demographics. The social conta-
gion model outperformed the demographics model at esti-
mating an individual’
s risk to be shot (Figure 4 and eFigure 10
in the Supplement). During the study period, the social con-
tagion model identified 5.3% (589 of 11 123) of the network’
s
subjects of gun violence among the 1.0% of the population it
deemed highest risk each day compared with 4.3% (475 of
11 123) identified by the demographics model (24.0% in-
crease).Thecombinedmodelperformedbest,identifying6.5%
(728 of 11 123) of subjects of gun violence when selecting the
1.0% highest-risk population daily. Compared with the demo-
graphics model, across the 3 daily high-risk population sizes
considered (0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%), the combined model cor-
rectly identified 71.7%, 65.5%, and 53.3% more subjects of gun
violence, respectively.
Discussion
Comparing levels of gun violence in the United States and its
concentration within communities with an epidemic garners
wide appeal but, scientifically, often stops at descriptive and
spatial analyses. Whereas previous research has been cross-
sectional, the present study advances understanding of gun
violence by modeling it as social contagion and by directly
tracking the contagion’
s spread. Our findings suggest not only
that gunshot violence concentrates within certain popula-
tions but also that the diffusion of violence follows an epi-
demic-like process of social contagion that is transmitted
through networks by social interactions. Violence prevention
efforts that account for contagion, in addition to demograph-
ics, to identify likely subjects of gun violence have the poten-
tial to prevent more shootings than efforts that focus on only
demographics.
Our research suggests that a holistic public health
approach to gun violence should be developed in at least 2
ways.53 First, violence prevention efforts should consider
the social dynamics of gun violence: tracing the spread of
violence episodes through social networks could provide
valuable information for public health and medical profes-
sionals, in addition to law enforcement, looking to intervene
with the people and communities at highest risk. Given that
public health and epidemiology are founded on studying
pathways of transmission, approaches from these domains
may readily extend to gun violence prevention efforts. For
example, information on the timing and pathways of gun-
shot cascades might provide street outreach workers of cam-
paigns (eg, Cure Violence, a violence prevention model used
in more than 50 US cities that draws on public health meth-
ods to mediate conflicts before they become violent54) with
a more accurate assessment of the people who would most
benefit from their program. Likewise, hospital-based vio-
lence intervention programs55,56 might follow such network
models to extend their services beyond the emergency
department to others within a social network who are also at
risk of becoming gunshot subjects.
Second,concertedeffortsshouldfocusonmakinggunvio-
lence prevention efforts subject focused rather than offender
focused by prioritizing the health and safety of those in harm’
s
way. Although mounting evidence from multiple cities sug-
gests that small place-, group-, and network-based interven-
tions can effectively reduce gun violence,57-60 these network-
based approaches have often relied heavily or solely on law
enforcement activities. The individuals identified in our study
are not in contact just with the criminal justice system: they
are also deeply embedded within the public health, educa-
tional, housing, and other governmental systems. A fully re-
alized public health approach centered on subjects of gun vio-
lence includes focused violence reduction efforts that work in
concert with efforts aimed at addressing the aggregate risk fac-
tors of gun violence, namely, the conditions that create such
networks in the first place or otherwise determine which in-
dividuals are in such networks (eg, neighborhood disadvan-
tage and failing schools).
Limitations
Several limitations of our study should be noted. First, we
lacked additional data that might have been relevant to un-
derstanding individual and neighborhood risk factors, such as
substance abuse, employment, and police activity. There-
fore, our models may have underestimated the predictive abil-
ity of demographic and ecological risk factors. Second, al-
though our descriptive findings of the Chicago co-offending
network were similar to those from Boston and Newark,16,17
additional research is needed to understand how city-
specific factors like segregation, public housing policies, street
gangs, and the availability of guns might influence the struc-
ture of social networks and the transmission process of gun
violence within them. Third, our study relied on a single be-
havioral tie, co-offending, and thus failed to capture other so-
cial ties (eg, kinship, friendship, employment, and gang mem-
bership) that might also facilitate the contagion process or
protect individuals from infection. Specifically, we were un-
able to assess why some individuals in the social network (in-

violence as an epidemic that spreads through social networks
via interpersonal interactions can improve violence preven-
