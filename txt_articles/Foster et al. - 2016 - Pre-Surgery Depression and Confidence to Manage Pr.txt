Abstract
Purpose
This paper identifies predictors of recovery trajectories of quality of life (QoL), health status
and personal wellbeing in the two years following colorectal cancer surgery.
Methods
872 adults receiving curative intent surgery during November 2010 to March 2012. Ques-
tionnaires at baseline, 3, 9, 15, 24 months post-surgery assessed QoL, health status, well-
being, confidence to manage illness-related problems (self-efficacy), social support, co-
morbidities, socio-demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics. Group-based trajec-
tory analyses identified distinct trajectories and predictors for QoL, health status and
wellbeing.
Results
Four recovery trajectories were identified for each outcome. Groups 1 and 2 fared consis-
tently well (scores above/within normal range); 70.5% of participants for QoL, 33.3% health
status, 77.6% wellbeing. Group 3 had some problems (24.2% QoL, 59.3% health, 18.2%
wellbeing); Group 4 fared consistently poorly (5.3% QoL, 7.4% health, 4.2% wellbeing).
Higher pre-surgery depression and lower self-efficacy were significantly associated with

including disease characteristics, stoma, anxiety and social support.
Conclusions
Psychosocial factors including self-efficacy and depression before surgery predict recovery
trajectories in QoL, health status and wellbeing following colorectal cancer treatment inde-
pendent of treatment or disease characteristics. This has significant implications for colorec-
tal cancer management as appropriate support may be improved by early intervention
resulting in more positive recovery experiences.
Introduction
Worldwide 17 million people are living with or beyond cancer. This figure is expected to triple
by 2050. If patients are not adequately supported their recovery may be impaired at a cost to
patients, those close to them, health and social care [1].
Cancer care is changing to tailored care according to need rather than a single approach for
all. There is an increasing emphasis on supported self-management yet little is known about
how equipped cancer survivors are for this [2]. Foster and Fenlon developed a conceptual
framework of recovery from cancer in which confidence to manage problems and symptoms
(self-efficacy: belief in one’s ability to manage illness-related problems) is hypothesised to be
central to recovery [3]. A positive association between self-efficacy and quality of life (QoL) has
been reported in cross-sectional studies [4–6], however, prospective studies are lacking [7].
While studies have explored QoL following colorectal cancer, most are cross-sectional and
few include pre-treatment assessments [8]. Studies typically focus on specific outcomes, such
as physical [9] and psychological symptoms [10], comorbidities [9], and presence of a stoma
[11] which are associated with poorer QoL. Whilst these studies are important they are limited
in describing the impact of cancer treatment on individuals and the process of recovery, or
how individuals at risk of poor recovery can be identified or supported.
Previous literature suggests that QoL in the first years following colorectal cancer treatment
are similar or better than population norms [7]. However these data report overall means and
do not explore distinct groups of patients who may fare better or worse. Studies have begun to
examine this by identifying trajectories of recovery for different populations and outcomes. For
example, Dunn et al [12] identified 4 trajectories of psychological distress following colorectal
cancer with baseline assessment at 5 months; 19% had consistently low levels of distress how-
ever the majority (39%) experienced a moderate level of distress which increased rather than
decreased over time. Being younger, male, with late stage disease, low education and limited
social support was associated with worse distress over time. In a further paper, Dunn and col-
leagues [13] described trajectories of health-related QoL (HRQoL) and life satisfaction over 5
years among colorectal cancer survivors (no pre-treatment assessment); 4 distinct trajectories
were identified for HRQoL (measured by FACT-C), and 19% of respondents reported poor
HRQoL throughout the 5 years. Factors associated with poorest recovery included being youn-
ger, having low social support, negative cognitive appraisal and low optimism. These findings
have begun to enhance our understanding of the nature of longer-term recovery from cancer,
however they do not include self-efficacy or assessments before treatment begins.
This paper presents data from CREW, the first large-scale cohort study of a representative
group of colorectal cancer patients recruited before surgery and followed up at regular intervals

 that has a focus on recovery of health and wellbeing. We examine the impact of curative intent
treatment on the processes of recovery of health and wellbeing, the role of factors hypothesised
to be associated with recovery and implications for how patients can best be supported. The
objectives of this paper are to: 1) describe recovery trajectories after colorectal cancer surgery
in the first 2 years; and 2) find predictors for these, including self-efficacy.
Methods
Study design and participants
A prospective cohort study of colorectal cancer patients recruited from 29 UK hospitals
between November 2010 and March 2012 [14, 15]. Eligible patients: a) diagnosis of colorectal
cancer (Duke’s A-C, where A = T1/2, B = T3/4 N0 and C = T1-4 N1 or 2, with an R0 resection),
b) awaiting initial curative intent surgery, c) � 18 years, d) ability to complete questionnaires.
Exclusions: metastatic disease at diagnosis or prior diagnosis of cancer (exceptions: non-mela-
nomatous skin cancer; in situ carcinoma cervix). Written consent obtained and baseline ques-
tionnaires were completed prior to surgery wherever possible; follow-up questionnaires were
completed at 3, 9, 15 and 24 months post-surgery (longer-term assessments ongoing). Socio-
demographic information was collected at consent, including postcode, which was used to cal-
culate the Index of Multiple Deprivation, a measure of neighbourhood deprivation [16]. Clini-
cal and treatment details were collected from medical notes. Ethical approval was granted by
the UK NHS Health Research Authority NRES Committee South Central—Oxford B (REC ref:
10/H0605/31).
Measures
Areas of assessment were informed by our recovery framework [3]. Validated measures were
repeated at every time point unless otherwise indicated.
Quality of life, health status and personal wellbeing.
Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Sur-
vivors (QLACS [17]). Part 1 generic domains: negative feelings, positive feelings, cognitive
problems, pain, sexual interest/function, energy/fatigue, social avoidance. Summing these
domains (reverse-scoring positive feelings) yields Generic Summary Score (GSS). Part 2
(assessed �9 months) cancer-specific domains: appearance concerns, financial problems, dis-
tress from fear of recurrence, distress from family risk of cancer, benefits of cancer. Summing
these domains (excluding benefits of cancer) yields Cancer-specific Summary Score (CSS).
Higher scores represent poorer QoL (except positive feelings; benefits of cancer).
The EQ-5D and EQ Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measure health status [18, 19]. Scores
from each of 5 domains are combined and converted into a summary utility index; higher
scores indicate better health. A score of 1 for the utility index indicates “full health” (no prob-
lems on any of the 5 domains).
The Personal Wellbeing Index–Adult (PWI-A [20]) contains 8 items of satisfaction corre-
sponding to: standard of living, health, achieving in life, relationships, safety, community-con-
nectedness, future security, and spirituality/religion. An overall score of subjective wellbeing is
calculated, with higher scores denoting better wellbeing (< 70 represents reduced wellbeing).
Psychosocial factors. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI [21]) consists of 20 items (state
only), with a higher total score indicating greater state-anxiety; � 40 has been suggested to
indicate clinically significant anxiety [22].
Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D [23]) consists of 20 items, with a
higher total score indicating greater depression; � 20 has been suggested to indicate clinical
depression (major and minor) for cancer patients [24].

 Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form (PANAS [25]) consists of two 5-item
mood scales measuring positive and negative affect. Higher scores represent stronger positive
or negative emotions.
Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease Scale [26] consists of 6 items (S1 Fig). Higher
scores indicate greater confidence to manage illness-related problems.
Medical Outcomes Study (MOS [27]) consists of 19 items, 18 of which comprise 4 subscales
representing emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate support and positive social inter-
action. An overall support index is calculated as the mean of all individual items; higher scores
denote greater social support.
Statistical methods
Target sample size was 1000, based on ability to detect a difference of 0.5 of a standard devia-
tion (SD) in the QLACS-GSS (assuming mean 71.2, SD 25.6) [17], with 80% power and 5% sig-
nificance. This allowed for 30% drop-out and an intra-cluster correlation of 0.05 to take into
account cluster effects within sites.
Subscale scores were calculated according to published guidelines where available; otherwise
if �75% items within a subscale had been completed mean scores were imputed from com-
pleted items. Participants with missing questionnaires were included in analyses for time-
points for which they provided data; no imputation of missing questionnaires. Many subscale
scores were not normally distributed; means and standard deviations are presented, to enable
comparison with other studies. The Index of Multiple Deprivation was categorised into
quintiles.
Group-based trajectory analyses [28] were used to investigate whether distinct trajectories
of outcomes could be identified for QLACS-GSS, EQ-5D utility index and PWI. These are dis-
crete mixture models, which model the outcomes as censored normal data following a polyno-
mial time curve. The optimal number of distinct trajectories for each outcome was determined
using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [29, 30] to compare model fit (a change in BIC
>10 supports the more complex model), while aiming to avoid trajectories containing very few
individuals. The shape of each trajectory was assessed to determine whether it was best
described by a linear, quadratic or cubic function according to the significance of each term.
Statistical significance of model parameters was assessed by the Wald test. Estimated propor-
tions of participants within each trajectory were obtained from the models, with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI). Date of surgery was taken as time zero and follow-up time calculated
using date of questionnaire completion; timing of baseline questionnaire (pre/post-surgery)
was adjusted for in all trajectory models.
Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine statistically significant predictors of
trajectory group membership from the following domains measured at baseline: (i) pre-existing
factors (sociodemographic, clinical, treatment) and (ii) psychosocial factors (anxiety, depres-
sion, positive/negative affect, self-efficacy, social support). Factors found to be significant or
borderline significant (p<0.1) from univariate analyses were modelled together, and only those
which remained statistically significant were retained in the final prediction models. Odds
ratios (OR), with 95% CI for each predictor were obtained from the regression models.
Results
A total of 1,056 participants consented to the study (910 to all aspects of data collection and
146 to collection of medical details only) out of 1,234 invited. Post-surgery, 38/910 were
deemed ineligible due to benign or advanced disease, leaving 872 participants for follow-up, of
whom 15 withdrew consent prior to baseline data collection (Fig 1). The final denominator for

 collection of questionnaire data was 857 participants. The sample is representative of eligible
patients treated in the recruitment period and includes: 64.6% colon and 35.4% rectal patients
(Table 1). 18.4% received neoadjuvant, 34.7% adjuvant therapy and 35.4% had a stoma (most
temporary). A total of 39 participants reported having ever used mental health services (5.4%
of the 723 who responded to this item on the baseline questionnaire). By 24 months, 79 partici-
pants (9.3%) had experienced a recurrence (median 13 months), 65 (7%) had died, and 105
(12%) had withdrawn (Fig 1). Response rates were high at each time point; 809 (94.4%) com-
pleted at least one questionnaire from baseline to 2 years and were included in longitudinal
analyses. Most participants (592/857, 69%) were consented and completed their baseline ques-
tionnaire prior to surgery but due to logistical issues (e.g. those receiving emergency surgery or
surgical dates altered without notifying the research nurse) some were enrolled soon after sur-

 gery. Overall scores for QLACS, EQ-5D and PWI at each time-point show participants were
coping reasonably well up to 2 years post-surgery, with mean scores on QLACS-GSS compara-
ble with other cancer survivors at 15 months [31], with over 40% reporting “full” health on the
EQ-5D (compared with 35% reported by Downing et al [32]) at 15 and 24 months, and 65–
70% above the cut-off for reduced wellbeing throughout follow-up (Table 2).
Trajectories of quality of life, health status and personal wellbeing
Four trajectories of recovery from surgery to 2 years (Groups 1–4) were identified for each of
the 3 outcome measures representing QoL (QLACS-GSS), health status (EQ-5D) and personal
wellbeing (PWI) (S1 Table), and the estimated proportion of the CREW sample in each trajec-
tory was obtained. For QLACS-GSS (similar pattern for all QLACS Part 2 subscales), where
low scores indicate better QoL, Group 1 had consistently good QoL (below median baseline
score for the whole CREW sample), (31.3%, 95% CI 26.8–35.8%); Group 2 had consistently
average QoL (39.2%, 95% CI 34.4–43.9%); Group 3 had worsened QoL in the short-term (�9
months) which then improved from 15 months, (24.2%, 95% CI 20.1–28.4%); Group 4 had

For the EQ-5D utility index (Fig 2B), Group 1 began with some (mild) problems but
improved by 15 months, reaching a mean score of 1 indicating “full” health (20.9%, 95% CI
16.5–25.3%); Group 2 had consistently good health status which declined slightly from 15
months (12.4%, 95% CI 8.7–16.1%); Group 3 showed consistent health problems over the 2
years (59.3%, 95% CI 54.9–63.6%); and Group 4 displayed fluctuating and the poorest health of
the CREW participants (7.4% of CREW sample, 95% CI 4.8–10.0%). For some of the trajecto-
ries the change in EQ-5D utility score over time was greater than a published cut-off of 0.08 for
a minimally important difference [33].
For the PWI (Fig 2C), Group 1 reported consistently good wellbeing throughout, with scores
well above the 70–80 normal range (44.9%, 95% CI 39.1–50.7%); Group 2 had a mean PWI
around 80 at baseline which declined to around 70 by 2 years (32.7%, 95% CI 27.5–37.8%);
Group 3 showed declining levels of wellbeing which were consistently below the threshold of 70
for reduced wellbeing (18.2%, 95% CI 14.0–22.4%); and Group 4 had the poorest levels of wellbe-
ing consistently <70 and which declined over the 2 years (4.2%, 95% CI 2.3–6.2%).
Across the three outcomes, 56.1% (454/809) were in the best trajectory (Group 1) and
10.7% (87/809) in the poorest trajectory (Group 4) for at least one of the outcome measures.
Baseline predictors of group membership
Frequencies of sociodemographic, clinical, treatment and psychosocial characteristics accord-
ing to estimated trajectories for QoL, health status and wellbeing are shown in S2 Table. Lower
self-efficacy and a higher level of depression before surgery were statistically significantly asso-
ciated with poorer trajectories for all three outcome measures adjusting for other significant
predictors (Table 3). For example, adjusted OR for QLACS-GSS Group 4 (poorest QoL) versus
Group 1 (best QoL) for self-efficacy was 0.32 (95%CI 0.24–0.44, p<0.001), indicating a 68%
reduced odds of being in Group 4 versus Group 1 with every unit increase in the score for self-
efficacy. Adjusted ORs for self-efficacy for EQ-5D and PWI Group 4 versus Group 1 were 0.60

1 Overall denominators are less than those shown in Fig 1 as data were only included in the cross-sectional analyses presented in the table if the
questionnaire was completed within a given time-frame around the due date: pre-surgery or < 3 months post-surgery for the baseline questionnaire, ± 2
months for the 3 and 9-month questionnaires and ± 3 months for the 15 and 24-month questionnaires. Denominators also vary for the different subscales
within each time-point. Proportion of participants with missing data on individual subscales ranges from 0.2% (QLACS energy/fatigue) to 10.6% (QLACS
sexual interest/function).
2 Individual QLACS subscales can range from 4–28; Generic Summary Score can range from 28–196; Cancer Summary Score can range from 16–112.
Higher scores for QLACS scales indicate poorer QoL, with the exception of positive feelings and benefits of cancer, where higher scores indicate better
QoL.
3 The EQ-5D summary index (utility score) ranges from -0.59 to 1, and the EQ-5D VAS has an overall range of 0–100; higher scores represent better
health. A score of 1 represents “full health” (no problems on any of the 5 health domains).
4 PWI can range from 0–100, with higher scores representing greater wellbeing/satisfaction with life.

 (0.45–0.81, p = 0.001) and 0.43 (0.31–0.59, p<0.001) respectively, indicating similarly large
reductions in odds of being the poorest trajectory with increased self-efficacy. Similarly for
depression, adjusted ORs for Group 4 versus Group 1 were 1.20 (1.12–1.28, p<0.001) for
QLACS-GSS (indicating a 20% increased odds of being in Group 4 versus Group 1 for every
unit increase in the score for depression), 1.13 (1.06–1.20, p<0.001) for EQ-5D and 1.14 (1.07–
1.22, p<0.001) for PWI, all indicating a higher risk of being in the poorest trajectories for those
with greater depression. The prevalence of clinically significant depression (CESD score � 20)
in Group 4 was 77.1% for QLACS-GSS, 66.0% for EQ-5D and 81.5% for PWI, although abso-
lute numbers in this group were small.
Other factors found in the multiple regression to be statistically significantly associated with
poorer trajectories for at least one of the outcomes were higher levels of anxiety, and presence
of stoma (both QLACS-GSS and EQ-5D), lower social support (QLACS-GSS and PWI), female
gender, greater deprivation, more co-morbidities, adjuvant treatment (EQ-5D), younger age,
living alone, neo-adjuvant treatment (PWI); (Table 3). There were no statistically significant
associations between trajectory group membership and tumour site, Duke’s stage, and positive
and negative affect. Recurrence was examined and made only minor differences to the results
of the trajectory analyses.
Discussion
This paper reveals for the first time that pre-surgery level of self-efficacy, i.e. confidence to
manage illness-related problems, and depression predict recovery trajectories in all three out-
comes of QoL, health status and wellbeing, independent of treatment or disease characteris-
tics. This has significant implications for cancer management as self-efficacy can be
enhanced by intervention, and depression may be better supported during the treatment
phase to improve the recovery experiences of a significant proportion of colorectal cancer
patients. Other important predictors of poor recovery include higher pre-surgery levels of
anxiety, lower social support and stoma, which were each significant for two of the outcome
domains. Older age was significantly associated with higher levels of wellbeing. This paper
identifies who is most in need of intensive support from the point of surgery so resources can
be directed accordingly.
Previous research has described the consequences of treatment for colorectal cancer [32]
and attention is often focused on supporting recovery once treatment has finished. Self-efficacy
has emerged as an independent predictor of recovery of QoL, health status and wellbeing,
which suggests health and social care professionals should assess levels of self-efficacy from the
point of diagnosis to identify those at risk of poorer recovery. Individuals reporting clinically
significant levels of depression also need to receive adequate support to enhance their recovery
experiences. The prevalence of depression at cancer diagnosis and its impact on recovery from
cancer treatment is not well described. Most patients with depression do not receive potentially
effective treatment for their depression [34]. Despite guidance (NICE, 2004 [35], NCCN 2015
[36], NHMRC 2003 [37]) that structured psychological assessment should be undertaken at
key points in the individual’s pathway, there is little evidence that this is routinely carried out
at diagnosis. Benefit has been demonstrated in managing anxiety and depression using formal-
ised screening [38] and early identification of pre-disposing factors will be key to managing the
impact of a cancer diagnosis. Early assessment and intervention to support those experiencing
anxiety, depression and low self-efficacy may significantly improve the recovery experiences of
those in the worst trajectories. Given that future services will be tailored to meet people’s needs
following their treatment it is important that we consider how low self-efficacy and depression

May 12, 2016
13 / 18
 will be supported in practice and where barriers to support exist as the longer-term conse-
quences for recovery may be compromised by poor support.
Interventions designed to enhance self-efficacy have been shown to be effective for people
living with cancer and treatment-related problems [39]. Dunn and colleagues [12] describe the
importance of social support, cancer threat appraisal and optimism in relation to long-term
QoL and suggest interventions that target self-efficacy, although they did not measure self-effi-
cacy in their study. Data from CREW provides the first prospective longitudinal data relating
to the association between self-efficacy and QoL, health status and wellbeing in colorectal can-
cer and supports this suggestion. Failing to provide appropriate support to enable people to
self-manage the consequences of cancer and its treatment may leave them feeling overbur-
dened, lead to less self-management, greater inequalities, reduced access to services and poorer
health and wellbeing [1].
In clinical practice, treatment- and disease-specific factors are frequently used as predictors
of outcome, for example; co-morbidities [9, 40–42] having a stoma [43] and symptoms experi-
enced as a consequence of treatment [32]. We found no evidence for independent predictive
effects of clinical factors including tumour site and disease stage, nor of personal affect. Assess-
ment of outcomes representing QoL, health status and personal wellbeing in CREW provides a
more detailed picture of overall recovery not captured by previous longitudinal studies [12,
32]. This paper demonstrates that it is important to assess psychosocial characteristics includ-
ing self-efficacy, anxiety, depression and social support, and to do this early in the treatment
pathway so that additional support can be offered.
Results of physical symptoms and functioning data that were collected in CREW from 3
months onwards (using EORTC QLQ-C30 [44] and QLQ-CR29 [45] questionnaires) will be
presented separately, including the effect of these on overall quality of life. Additional analyses
of other clinical outcomes in CREW including recurrence and survival will also be reported
separately.
Study limitations
We set out to recruit all eligible colorectal cancer patients treated with curative intent surgery
in 29 cancer centres over a specific period; 91% of all eligible participants were approached.
Older patients and the very frail are underrepresented in the sample although there were a
number of participants > 80 years. For a number of reasons, some baseline questionnaires
were completed after surgery; whilst this maximises the proportion of eligible participants able
to be included in CREW, this introduced some variation in baseline responses, and so all analy-
ses were adjusted for time of response to baseline questionnaire. Whilst response rates were
high at each time point there has been attrition as would be expected: 10% of the sample has
actively withdrawn, 7% have had a recurrence and a similar proportion has died. Incomplete
follow-up may have introduced some bias into the longitudinal analyses, although a sensitivity
analysis including only the participants with all five completed questionnaires from baseline to
2 years produced similar results for the trajectories. One challenge for research of this type is
continuing to engage those who no longer wish to be reminded about their cancer.
Implications / indications
Novel findings from this study raise important questions for transforming cancer management
to identify those at risk of poor recovery before treatment begins and direct services to those
most in need. Internationally, cancer care is rapidly changing with the aim of supporting indi-
viduals to self-manage. Integral to this are holistic needs assessments, care planning, treatment
summaries, cancer care reviews and health and wellbeing events. These assessments and
Confidence to Manage Health-Related Problems Predict Recovery

 reviews generally focus on physical symptoms, treatment and clinical factors. Where psycho-
logical or social domains are examined a problem or need is often quantified, but a person’s
capacity to manage is often not considered. The trajectories identified offer a clear opportunity
to develop a stepped approach to care offering self-management support to enhance self-effi-
cacy and those identified as having clinical depression, and likely to fare least well, being
referred to specialist psychological services. One of the next steps in the research process will
be to develop a screening tool based on the risk factors reported here, to identify those individ-
uals at greatest risk of falling into the lower trajectories, irrespective of disease-specific parame-
ters, and use this information to intervene to support them at an early stage in the pathway i.e.
soon after diagnosis. This has the potential to revolutionise patient assessment and care-plan-
ning and enhance patient care.
