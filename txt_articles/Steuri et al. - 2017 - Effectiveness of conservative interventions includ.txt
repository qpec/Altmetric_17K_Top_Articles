AbstrAct
Objective To investigate the effectiveness of 
conservative interventions for pain, function and range of 
motion in adults with shoulder impingement.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of 
randomised trials.
Data sources Medline, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase and 
PEDro were searched from inception to January 2017.
study selection criteria Randomised controlled trials 
including participants with shoulder impingement and 
evaluating at least one conservative intervention against 
sham or other treatments.
results For pain, exercise was superior to non-exercise 
control interventions (standardised mean difference 
(SMD) −0.94, 95% CI −1.69 to −0.19). Specific exercises 
were superior to generic exercises (SMD −0.65, 95% CI 
−0.99 to −0.32). Corticosteroid injections were superior 
to no treatment (SMD −0.65, 95% CI −1.04 to −0.26), 
and ultrasound guided injections were superior to 
non-guided injections (SMD −0.51, 95% CI −0.89 to 
−0.13). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) 
had a small to moderate SMD of −0.29 (95% CI −0.53 
to −0.05) compared with placebo. Manual therapy 
was superior to placebo (SMD −0.35, 95% CI −0.69 to 
−0.01). When combined with exercise, manual therapy 
was superior to exercise alone, but only at the shortest 
follow-up (SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.62 to −0.01). Laser 
was superior to sham laser (SMD −0.88, 95% CI −1.48 
to −0.27). Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ECSWT) 
was superior to sham (−0.39, 95% CI −0.78 to –0.01) 
and tape was superior to sham (−0.64, 95% CI −1.16 to 
−0.12), with small to moderate SMDs.
conclusion Although there was only very low quality 
evidence, exercise should be considered for patients 
with shoulder impingement symptoms and tape, ECSWT, 
laser or manual therapy might be added. NSAIDS and 
corticosteroids are superior to placebo, but it is unclear 
how these treatments compare to exercise.
IntrODuctIOn
Shoulder complaints are the third common 
musculoskeletal presentation after back and neck 
disorders in primary care, and shoulder disorders 
account for 10% of referrals to physiotherapy 
in the Netherlands.1 The incidence of shoulder 
complaints is 29.3 per 1000 person-years2 and the 
1-year prevalence, 21%;3 with the highest incidence 
and prevalence in women and persons aged 45–64 
years. Among people with shoulder pain, shoulder 
impingement syndrome (SIS) has the highest preva-
lence and accounts for 36% of shoulder disorders.4
SIS is a generic term for injury of structures in 
the subacromial space, such as rotator cuff tendi-
nosis, partial thickness tears of the rotator cuff and 
bursitis.5 The aetiology of rotator cuff injury and 
its relationship to subacromial impingement, the 
encroachment of the involved structures, are still a 
matter of debate.6
The common consequences of SIS are pain and 
disability, loss of quality of life and sleep distur-
bances.7 An ongoing impingement process with 
serious rotator cuff damage can lead to complete 
joint destruction and end in a replacement of 
the glenohumeral joint.8 Tears in the rotator cuff 
tendons are common in symptomatic shoulders, 
whereas up to 16.9% of asymptomatic shoulders 
also demonstrate tears in the rotator cuff.9 The 
prevalence increases with age.10
The main treatment goals for patients with SIS 
are to reduce the common impairments related to 
pain, and to improve upper extremity function.
Systematic reviews and meta-analysis5 11–39 have 
investigated treatment effects in patients with 
shoulder impingement. However, missing are (1) 
a comprehensive overview of all relevant inter-
ventions, (2) outcomes from all levels of disability, 
that is, impairments and activity limitations or 
participation restrictions40 and (3) an outcome 
selection based on an a priori stated hierarchy.
The aim of this systematic review and meta-anal-
ysis of randomised trials was to provide a 
comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of all 
relevant non-surgical interventions for adults with 
shoulder impingements and outcomes on impair-
ment (pain and active range of motion (AROM)), 
activity limitation or participation restriction 
(shoulder function questionnaires) based on an a 
priori stated hierarchy.
MethODs
We followed the recommendations of the PRISMA 
statement for the conduct and reporting of this 
review.41

review
Trials Register (CENTRAL), Embase, Medline, CINAHL, and 
PEDro were searched (search strategy in online supplemen-
tary appendix 1) for randomised controlled trials, published as 
full text in peer-reviewed journals from inception to January 
2017. Only Chinese and Farsi language articles were excluded. 
Relevant reviews and selected articles were also screened for 
potentially relevant studies (see flow chart in online supple-
mentary appendix 1). Trials that enrolled patients with shoulder 
impingement diagnosed with a minimal set of diagnostic criteria 
(one criteria fulfilled of the box ‘Complaints of shoulder pain’ 
in table 1, or diagnosed by MRI or ultrasound) and any kind of 
conservative interventions were eligible for inclusions.
Trials were included if surgery was compared with conserva-
tive interventions but not if only different types of surgery or 
postoperative interventions were compared. Trials that included 
patients with calcifying tendinitis, frozen shoulders, treatments 
after surgery and secondary impingement were excluded.
The protocol of this review was presented to an expert 
committee but not published or registered. Some amendments 
were made to the protocol after inclusion of the studies but 
prior to data analysis. This refers, for example, to the amend-
ment of the hierarchy of outcome measures, (ie, which outcome 
measure should be selected if several measures were used for 
one outcome) or the refraining from performing a network 
meta-analysis because of clinical heterogeneity.
study selection criteria and selection process
Each title and abstract was independently screened by pairs of 
researchers (RS, CK, SE, RH), based on established criteria. Full 
texts were independently screened by two authors (RS, RH). 
Disagreement was resolved by consensus, and a third author 
(MS) was consulted if consensus could not be reached.
Data extraction process
The lead author extracted data of the characteristics of the 
individual trials and all outcomes for all time points into spread-
sheets. A second author (RH) checked the data for accuracy. 
The primary outcomes considered in this systematic review 
were pain and shoulder function. The secondary outcome was 
range of motion. Outcomes were extracted from the longest 
available follow-up (for main analysis) and the first time point 
available after the end of the intervention period (for sensitivity 
analysis). For all outcomes, we defined, a priori, a hierarchy of 
outcome measures based on the literature and theoretical consid-
erations, and extracted data accordingly (table 2). When a study 
reported multiple scales for a given outcome, the highest on 
the hierarchy of pain and shoulder function related scale was 
chosen (table 2). If reported, change score from baseline to the 
follow-up were extracted, or else postintervention scores were 
used.42
risk of bias
The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool was used to assess the risk of 
bias in each included article.43 Each article was graded (unclear, 
low or high risk of bias) based on sequence generation, allocation 
concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of 
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, other possible 
bias, intention-to-treat analysis, selective reporting and baseline 
characteristics. The risk of bias assessment was completed by one 
author (RS) and checked by a second author (MS). Disagree-
ments were resolved by discussion, and a third author (RH) was 
consulted if consensus could not be reached.
Quality of evidence
The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, 
and Evaluation44 tool was used to assess the overall quality of 
evidence. For every comparison, evidence started out to be 
strong. We decreased the level of evidence by 1 for each of the 
following factors: risk of bias, inconsistency of results, indirect-
ness, imprecision and other biases, such as reporting bias.
This process of analysis was completed by using a combina-
tion of GRADE systematic and traffic alert action, that is, how

confident we are that it is effective or useless for each interven-
tion and for all outcomes (table 3; adapted from reference 45).45
Data management and synthesis
Individual study effect sizes were expressed as standardised 
mean differences (SMDs), calculated as the difference in means 
between the two groups, divided by the pooled SD of the 
measurement. For pain and shoulder function, the sign of the 
extracted scores was changed according to the idea that higher 
scores meant worse outcome. Hence, a negative effect size indi-
cated a beneficial effect for the experimental group. AROM 
scores were intuitively handled differently with higher scores 
indicating a better outcome. A positive effect size indicated a 
beneficial effect for the experimental group. If data were missing, 
we tried to contact the corresponding author. If mean or SDs 
were not reported, we used different methods to estimate those 
values (eg, extracting these data from figures, using median and 
IQR, p values or CIs).43
Each intervention was compared against different control 
groups such as other treatments, usual care or sham treatments. 
In this review, we used the term active intervention or active 
control for all treatments that were not placebo, sham or ‘doing 
nothing’. The term passive control was used for all sham or 
placebo interventions.43
Meta-analysis
We decided to use a random effects model a priori. Weighting 
factors were calculated using the DerSimonean and Laird 
method.46 Presence of heterogeneity was tested using a χ2 test 
(Q value) and its corresponding degrees of freedom and p value. 
The extent of heterogeneity was analysed using Higgins’ I2 value 
(expressed as %). We used a funnel plot to assess publication bias 
in those comparisons with at least 10 trials.47
To test the robustness of the overall weighted effect sizes, a 
sensitivity analysis was conducted by extracting results for the first 
time point available after the end of the intervention period. For 
example, if a study reported results at several follow-up time points 
(eg, immediately after the intervention period and at 3 months and 
6 
months), the 6-month data were used for the primary analysis 
(called longest follow-up) and the data from immediately after the 
intervention period were used for the sensitivity analysis (called 
shortest follow-up). Meta-analyses were performed in RevMan 
V
.5.3.48 In addition, for each risk of bias item, we calculated the 
differences in the effect sizes between studies with low risk of bias 
in this item and the studies with unclear or high risk of bias in 
this item. To test the influence of each risk of bias item on the 
effect size, we calculated the differences, and corresponding 95% 
CIs, between low risk and high risk of bias effect sizes. This was 
repeated for all risk of bias items.
results
study selection and characteristics
The electronic database search yielded 9351 studies, from 
which we screened 324 articles in full text screening (figure 1). 
Ultimately, we included 200 articles for analysis—177 in the 
quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) and 23 in the qualita-
tive synthesis (appendix 2). Ten trials had small samples sizes 
(n<20),49–54 whereas most of the studies had sample sizes 
ranging from 20 to 232 participants. Most studies included 
participants who were between 18 years and 65 years of age, 
while the duration of symptoms varied widely across the trials. 
Injection tests were used in 22 trials, 26 trials used unilateral 
shoulder problem as inclusion criteria. T
wo trials included only 
women or only men.55 56 In 50 trials there was a greater propor-
tion of female participants than male participants. Insufficient 
data were reported in 23 studies; we were able to obtain two 
additional data files.
risk of bias and quality of evidence
In 90% (n=159) of trials the random sequence generation was 
adequate. Adequate allocation concealment was observed as 
low risk of bias in 30% (n=54), unclear in 61% (n=108) and 
high risk of bias in 9% (n=15) of the included trials. Outcome 
assessors were blinded in 64% (n=114), while incomplete 
outcome data in 54% (n=96), and intention-to-treat analysis

were reported in 50% (n=89) of trials (see online supplemen-
tary appendix 5).
For all comparisons and outcomes, the quality of evidence was 
graded as very low.
It was appropriate to assess a funnel plot in one comparison 
(corticosteroids vs active controls) with 20 trials. The funnel plot 
had slight asymmetry, indicating a possible risk of publication 
bias. All other comparisons had less than 10 trials, so funnel 
plots were not examined.
Across all comparisons, trials with an unclear or high risk of 
bias on allocation concealment had a significantly greater effect 
than trials with correct allocation concealment for pain, indi-
cating a small bias (SMD of 0.28 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.51)). For 
function, AROM, and other risk of bias items in our sensitivity 
analyses, such as blinded outcome assessor for observer-based 
outcomes and intention-to-treat, there was no significant differ-
ence between trials with high risk and low risk of bias.
Meta-analysis: outcome pain
Hundred and one comparisons from 184 trials with 10 
529 
patients were included in this meta-analysis. Table 4 summarises 
the significant results from comparisons including at least 
 
100 patients. Online supplementary appendix 3a shows all 
summary effect sizes, the Higgins’ I2 measure of heteroge-
neity (in %) and the level of evidence from the GRADE rating 
approach. Online supplementary appendix 4a shows all forest 
plots for the 101 comparisons. The strongest, but still very low 
quality, evidence for the reduction in pain was found for the 
following treatments:
Corticosteroids
 
►
Corticosteroids were superior to control (6 studies, n=372, 
SMD −0.65, 95% 
CI −1.04 to −0.26)
 
►
Corticosteroids were superior to active controls (physical 
therapy modalities), but only at the shortest follow-up (20 
studies, n=1394, SMD −0.25, 95%

►
Ultrasound guided corticosteroid injections were superior 
to blind injections (5 studies, n=298, SMD −0.51, 95%

note: the quality of the evidence is very low and we have but very little confidence in the effect size estimate: The true 
effect size is likely to be substantially different from the estimated effect size. This does not mean that our results and 
conclusions are meaningless. Future research might change the conclusions and therefore, practitioners need to reconsider 
our conclusions if new research becomes available. For all interventions, the readers should bear in mind that due to the 
insufficient reporting of unexpected adverse effects, no advice can be given with regard to potential harms.
Green
Do it—this intervention is effective.
Orange
Uncertain effect—the effect of this intervention must be monitored, and alternative interventions need to be considered if the effect is not 
satisfactory.
Red
Don’t do it—this intervention is ineffective.
Corticosteroid injections
Orange
Corticosteroids were superior to doing nothing (pain −0.65, 95% CI −1.04 to −0.26; function −0.56, 95% CI −1.06 to −0.05).
Compared with active control (physical therapy modalities), corticosteroids were superior only at the shortest follow-up (pain −0.25, 
95% CI −0.46 to −0.05).
Corticosteroids may be an alternative treatment if a patient disagrees on the use of other effective treatment options with less side effects, 
such as exercise.
Ultrasound guided corticosteroid injections were superior to blind injections for pain (−0.51, 95% CI-0.89 to −0.13) and for function (−0.43, 
95% CI −0.71 to −0.15).
For active range of motion (AROM), local steroids were superior to systemic steroids (AROM 0.72, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.11).
There was no conclusive evidence for the comparison between corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Medicaments, other than 
corticosteroid injections
Orange
NSAIDs were superior to placebo (pain −0.29, 95% CI −0.53 to −0.05; AROM 2.62, 95% CI 2.25 to 3.00) but there is no evidence about 
how they compare to other treatments such as exercise.
Local anaesthetics were inferior to corticosteroids at the shortest follow-up (pain 0.45, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73).
Exercise
Orange
Exercise was superior to doing nothing (pain −0.94. 95% CI −1.69 to −0.19; function −0.57, 95% CI −0.85 to −0.29).
Specific exercise was superior to non-specific exercise (pain −0.65, 95% CI −0.99 to −0.32; function −0.68, 95% CI −1.26 to −0.10; AROM 
0.59, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.10). Exercise was less effective than surgery for pain but not for function (pain 31% risk difference, 95% CI 13% to 
49%), supporting surgery if indication for surgery is given (ie, tears).
Exercise was superior to non-exercise physical therapy (AROM 1.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.76).
Manual Therapy
Orange
Manual therapy was superior to doing nothing for pain (−0.35, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.01).
Manual therapy plus exercise was superior to sham ultrasound and placebo gel for function (−0.42, 95% CI −0.78 to −0.06).
Manual therapy combined with exercise was superior to exercise alone only for shortest follow-up (pain −0.32, 95% CI −0.62 to −0.01; 
function −0.41, 95% CI −0.71 to −0.11).
There were immediate effects (after one session) for manual therapy versus placebo for pain (−0.62, 95% CI −0.97 to −0.28).
Laser
Orange
Laser plus exercise was superior to exercise plus sham laser for pain (−0.65, 95% CI −0.99 to −0.31).
Laser was superior to sham laser for pain (−0.88, 95% CI −1.48 to −0.27).
Ultrasound
Orange
There was very low statistical precision for the effect estimates of ultrasound; the only significant effect was for long duration ultrasound 
(8 min) versus short duration (4 min) (pain −1.32, 95% CI −1.76 to −0.89; function −0.42, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.02).
Extracorporeal shockwave 
therapy (ECSWT)
Orange
ECSWT was superior to sham ECSWT for pain (−0.39, 95% CI −0.78 to −0.01) but there was not enough evidence for or against the use in 
combination with exercise.
Because exercise showed the best effects, the use of ECSWT as stand-alone therapy may be questionable.
Tape
Orange
Tape was superior to sham tape for pain (−0.64, 95% CI −1.16 to −0.12).
Hyaluronate
Orange
Insufficient evidence for or against the use of hyaluronate.
Pulsed electromagnetic 
field
Orange
Insufficient evidence for or against the use of pulsed electromagnetic field.
Transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation
Orange
Insufficient evidence for or against the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.
Surgery (vs conservative 
treatment)
Orange
Very low evidence that surgery was superior to exercise or physiotherapy for pain (−0.66, 95% CI −1.06 to −0.26).
We cannot exclude that a subset of patients will have a large benefit from surgery.
Acupuncture
Orange
Insufficient evidence for or against the use of acupuncture.
Diacutaneous fibrolysis
Orange
Insufficient evidence for or against the use of diacutaneous fibrolysis.
Nerve block
Orange
Nerve block was superior to control for pain and function (pain −0.91, 95% CI −1.27 to −0.54; function −0.55, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.08).
Myofascial trigger point
Orange
Insufficient evidence for or against the use of myofascial trigger point therapy.
Microwave
Orange
Insufficient evidence for or against the use of microwave.
Comprehensive

Orange
Insufficient evidence for or against the use of comprehensive physiotherapy.
Platelet rich plasma

DIscussIOn
This systematic review and meta-analysis includes 200 trials 
comparing strategies to treat shoulder impingement. There 
was very low quality evidence that for pain and function (1) 
corticosteroid injections were superior to doing nothing, and 
ultrasound guided corticosteroid injection was superior to 
blind injection; (2) exercise was superior to doing nothing, and 
specific exercise was superior to non-specific exercise. For pain, 
(3) manual therapy was superior to doing nothing or sham, 
manual therapy plus exercise was superior to exercise alone 
(but only at the shorter follow-ups) and manual therapy had 
immediate effects; and (4) laser was superior to sham. Finally, 
(5) for AROM exercise was superior to non-exercise physical 
therapy modalities. The quality of evidence was very low for all 
comparisons because of high risk of bias, lack of precision, lack 
of consistency and clinical heterogeneity.
strength and limitations of this review
There have been previously published reviews on SIS,12 13 16 18 57 
but only one review57 included all conservative interventions 
for SIS, and reported the outcomes pain, shoulder function and 
AROM. Therefore, our meta-analysis provides a comprehen-
sive overview. Another strength of this study is its systematic 
approach. We followed a stringent protocol and rigorously 
controlled every step of the process by two or more researchers. 
We are confident to have included most of the trials reporting 
on SIS. We used current recommendation to judge the risk of 
bias of the studies and we used the GRADE approach for the 
rating of the quality of evidence.58 It could have been expected 
that the large number of studies and participants would allow 
to provide strong evidence for or against the different interven-
tions. However, the methodological quality, the large clinical 
and statistical heterogeneity, and the low number of participants 
for most of the comparisons reduced the level of evidence to 
very low quality evidence. We have only low confidence in the 
overall effect size of our different meta-analyses. The underlying 
true population effect sizes might be substantially different from 
our estimated effect sizes. Nevertheless, some of the observed 
effects are large and therefore, despite the very low quality of 
evidence, we are confident that there is still a likely beneficial 
effect of the interventions.
The included trials had some specific limitations: There was 
a broad clinical diversity (such as duration of symptoms, diag-
nostic criteria used, sex ratio), and varying length of follow-up 
periods. Most of the included trials had a high risk of bias. It is 
suggested to either restrict the meta-analysis to studies with low 
risk of bias or to present the results of low risk of bias studies 
separately from those with high risk of bias. Because only few 
studies could be classified as low risk of bias, such an approach 
might have introduced selection bias in our systematic review.59 
Therefore, we decided to include all studies and to perform a 
sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of the high risk of 
bias studies.
There is a lack of uniformity in the concept of SIS. Braman 
et al60 argued to abandon the diagnosis impingement syndrome 
and to investigate more homogenous groups of patients. T
wo 
reviews on diagnostic tests proposed to use a battery of tests 
to confirm SIS.21 61 For example, to confirm SIS, three out of 
five tests need to be positive and SIS can be ruled out if less 
than three out of five tests are positive.62 Furthermore, the use 
of multiple tests could help to build a more homogenous group. 
The use of modern diagnostic technics, so far not routinely used 
in randomised trials, will enhance the inclusion process and 
support homogenous grouping.60 In our review only 61 trials 
out of 200 confirmed the diagnosis of shoulder impingement 
and related stage I–III with ultrasound or MRI. Because of 
insufficient reporting of patients’ characteristics regarding clas-
sification of impingement (ie, stage I–III) we were not able to 
perform separate analysis for the different stages. This would 
be an important analysis, as each stage needs different interven-
tion targets. The interventions might have varying effects in the 
different stages.
Including trials with varying length of follow-up periods 
resulted in additional heterogeneity. Follow-up periods in future 
trials need to be longer to learn more about the course of SIS.63 
In our meta-analysis 137 studies assessed patients within 2 
weeks 
after end of treatment, 54 studies at 6 
weeks, 52 studies at 
the end of 3 
months, 24 studies up to 6 
months, whereas only 
 
21 studies had a follow-up longer than 6 months, and in 3 studies 
the length of follow-up was unclear.51 64 65
Not all interventions were compared against validated sham 
interventions or placebo. Non-valid sham interventions might 
disclose blinding of the participants and hence lead to a falsely 
increased (biassed) effect size in some of the comparisons against 
sham interventions. For example, there exist validated sham 
procedures for manual therapy.66
We found a higher proportion of women in the included trials, 
which is in line with survey data on 2144 Japanese patients 
having SIS, of whom 60% were women and 40% were men.67 
Hence, with regard to gender mix, our results are generalisable.
Unfortunately, we had to exclude several trials (n=23) for 
the quantitative analysis because of missing data. However, it 
is unlikely that those missing results would have changed our 
reported evidence on effect.
comparisons with other studies
There exist several other reviews, although previous reviews have 
focused on fewer interventions.14–16 19 28 57 The most important 
difference between our systematic review, and previously 
published reviews is that we have a more stringent assessment of 
the risk of bias and quality of included trials. This is important 
because the strength of recommendations (eg, in future guide-
lines) will be based on the quality of the evidence. Furthermore, 
we performed a meta-analysis and decided to evaluate hetero-
geneity with I2 statistics, although we refrained from doing a 
network meta-analysis because of the high clinical heterogeneity.
For exercise, our results are in line with the other reviews, 
with the exception that we concluded that there is only very 
low quality evidence where other studies reported moderate14 
or even high or strong evidence.15 38 T
wo reviews evaluated 
scapula-focused treatments, reporting moderate evidence,36 and 
significant but clinically not relevant effects;68 whereas we did 
not separately analyse the scapula-focused treatments.
T
wo previous reviews18 57 concluded that exercise (stretching 
and strengthening of the rotator cuff and scapular muscles) was 
as effective as surgery. This contrasts with our interpretation that 
there is insufficient evidence to state whether exercise is as good 
as surgery. We classified studies comparing exercise to surgery 
as being at very high risk of bias. Therefore, our differing inter-
pretation may be first due to our more severe rating of the risk 
of bias (eg, we classified Haahr et al69 70 and Ketola et al71 72 as 
high risk of bias studies, whereas Saltychev18 classified them as 
low risk of bias. One argument for a high risk of bias rating was

What are the new findings?
 
► Exercise therapy was effective in improving pain, function 
and active range of motion.
 
► Specific exercises were more effective than general shoulder 
exercises.
 
► NSAIDS, corticosteroid injections (with an advantage for 
ultrasound guided injections), manual therapy, tape in 
combination with exercise, extracorporeal shockwave 
therapy and laser were also effective.
 
► The quality of evidence was very low, therefore clinicians 
should apply this evidence cautiously when making clinical 
decisions.
review
the fact that in the study by Haahr et al69 70 6 out of 43 patients 
in the exercise group were operated, 5 of them because of unsat-
isfactory improvements with exercise, and in the study by Ketola 
et al71 72 14 patients from 70 allocated to the exercise group 
underwent surgery). Second, we also analysed a dichotomised 
pain outcome, which showed very low quality evidence for an 
advantage of surgery. However, we cannot exclude that a subset 
of patients may benefit from surgery.
Acupuncture has been recommended as a first choice to be 
added to exercises for the treatment of early stage shoulder 
impingement,13 whereas we did not find enough evidence to 
make a statement in favour or against acupuncture. Our results 
for corticosteroid injections were in line with other reviews,22 24 
although we classified the evidence as a lower level of evidence 
(very low quality compared with moderate to strong in).15 
Our review supports previous findings14 regarding low quality 
evidence for manual therapy. We found positive results for 
laser, although previous reviews are conflicting about whether 
laser is16 or is not13 57 effective. This might be because previous 
reviews have included fewer studies,13 and have not performed a 
meta-analysis and probably based their statements of evidence on 
non-significance of the individual trials.57 Our results for ultra-
sound therapy, hyaluronate, tape, pulsed electromagnetic field 
therapy, ECSWT, microwave and platelet-rich plasma support 
previous reviews.11 13
Implication for research
Larger trials that employ rigorous methodology to reduce the 
risk of bias studies and follow patients for longer than 6 months 
should be performed. Future trials must include homogenous 
populations, regarding clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria 
and duration of symptoms.60 Also, health economic evaluations 
alongside such trials are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness 
and cost utility of different interventions. In studies comparing 
surgery with conservative interventions a clinical decision rule 
should be evaluated,73 to distinguish patients who will only 
benefit from surgery from those who will recover with conser-
vative treatments. Further research is also needed to evaluate 
exercise modalities and strategies to increase exercise adherence.
Implication for practice
Although our review only provides very low quality evidence, 
we suggest that exercise may be considered as the core conserva-
tive treatment for shoulder impingement. Furthermore, manual 
therapy, laser and tape might provide additional benefit. Surgery 
may be a valid alternative after unsuccessful conservative treat-
ments, and for patients with clearly distinguished clinical signs. 
Most shoulder surgeons in the UK use a minimum period of 
 
12 weeks of conservative treatments and at least two subacro-
mial steroid injections.74
cOnclusIOn
Exercise, especially shoulder-specific exercises, should be 
prescribed for all patients with shoulder impingement. The addi-
tion of manual therapy, tape, ECSWT and laser might add a small 
benefit. For other non-exercise physical therapy modalities, we 
cannot provide enough evidence for or against, therefore they 
should only be used in addition with exercise. Corticosteroid 
injections seems to be a valid alternative only when exercise or 
other modalities are not possible while NSAIDS can be helpful, 
if necessary, in addition to exercise. Future research should eval-
uate treatments applied to patients with a more clearly defined 
diagnosis.
