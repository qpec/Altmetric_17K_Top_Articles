Abstract
Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting and disabling side effect of taxane anti-
cancer agents. We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of cryotherapy for CIPN prevention.
Methods: Breast cancer patients treated weekly with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 for one hour) wore frozen gloves and socks on the
dominant side for 90 minutes, including the entire duration of drug infusion. Symptoms on the treated sides were compared
with those on the untreated (nondominant) sides. The primary end point was CIPN incidence assessed by changes in tactile
sensitivity from pretreatment baseline in a monofilament test at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2. We also assessed
thermosensory deficits, subjective symptoms (Patient Neuropathy Questionnaire [PNQ]), manipulative dexterity, and the
time to events and hazard ratio by PNQ. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Among the 40 patients, four did not reach the cumulative dose (due to the occurrence of pneumonia, severe fatigue,
severe liver dysfunction, and macular edema), leaving 36 patients for analysis. None dropped out due to cold intolerance.
The incidence of objective and subjective CIPN signs was clinically and statistically significantly lower on the intervention
side than on the control (hand: tactile sensitivity ¼ 27.8% vs 80.6%, odds ratio [OR] ¼ 20.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 3.20
to 828.96, P < .001; foot: tacile sensitivity ¼ 25.0% vs 63.9%, OR ¼ infinite, 95% CI ¼ 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; hand: warm sense
¼ 8.8% vs 32.4%, OR ¼ 9.00, 95% CI ¼ 1.25 to 394.48, P ¼ .02; foot: warm sense: 33.4% vs 57.6%, OR ¼ 5.00, 95% CI ¼ 1.07 to 46.93,
P ¼ .04; hand: PNQ ¼ 2.8% vs 41.7%, OR ¼ infinite, 95% CI ¼ 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; foot: PNQ ¼ 2.8% vs 36.1%, OR ¼ infinite,
95% CI ¼ 2.78 to infinite, P < .001; hand: hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.13, 95% CI ¼ 0.05 to 0.34; foot: HR ¼ 0.13, 95% CI ¼ 0.04 to 0.38,
dexterity mean delay ¼ �2.5 seconds, SD ¼ 12.0 seconds, vs þ 8.6 seconds, SD ¼ 25.8 seconds, P ¼ .005).
Conclusions: Cryotherapy is useful for preventing both the objective and subjective symptoms of CIPN and resultant
dysfunction.
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a fre-
quent and disabling side effect of cancer treatment, primarily
taxanes and platinum agents (1). CIPN reduces health-related
quality of life (2) and often results in dose delay, dose reduction,
or treatment discontinuation (3). A patient-reported outcome
study found that CIPN numbness persisted in 67%–80% of

 patients for one year following the completion of paclitaxel
therapy (4). Duloxetine was recommended for CIPN; however, it
has limited efficacy for the amelioration of chemotherapy-
induced pain, and none for numbness or functional disability
(4,5). Furthermore, no established strategy exists for CIPN pre-
vention (4).
Therapeutic regional hypothermia (cryotherapy) can reduce
chemotherapy-induced complications by decreasing regional
perfusion with acceptable tolerability (6). Frozen gloves and socks
prevented docetaxel-induced nail and skin toxicity in prospec-
tive, self-controlled trials that compared the protected side with
the nonprotected side (7,8). A retrospective study indicated that
the occurrences of docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy was
lower in the patients who used frozen gloves and socks com-
pared to the patients who did not wear them (35% vs. 57%) (9).
Because CIPN symptoms are largely subjective and many
clinicians underestimate their severity using the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 4.0 (CTCAE) (10,11),
prospective trials with patient-reported outcomes may be supe-
rior for evaluating preventative efficacy; however, additional
end points, including objective and functional assessments, are
also needed to control for the placebo response bias of patient-
reported outcomes. A self-controlled design can mitigate the
effects of other confounders, including individual differences in
sensory detection. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness
of cryotherapy against paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropa-
thy in a prospective self-controlled trial with multiple end
points (e.g., objective, subjective, and functional assessments).
Methods
Study Design
This
self-controlled
clinical
trial evaluated
the
preventive
effects of cryotherapy for CIPN. As in previous cryotherapy stud-
ies (7,8), each patient wore frozen flexible gloves and socks
(Elasto-Gel, 84400 APT Cedex, Akromed, France) on the domi-
nant hand and foot from 15 minutes before paclitaxel adminis-
tration
to
15 minutes
after
the
infusion
was
complete
(90 minutes in total). Frozen gloves were replaced after the first
45 minutes. The nondominant side acted as the untreated con-
trol. Symptoms of CIPN were assessed before chemotherapy
(baseline) and before every cycle of paclitaxel administration
during outpatient care. We analyzed the time to events (the cu-
mulative doses to subjective CIPN events [PNQ � D]) and CIPN
symptoms at the cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2, which is the
recommended dose for neo-adjuvant and adjuvant weekly pac-
litaxel therapy (12).
To explore the risk factors for CIPN, we assessed the phar-
macokinetics during the first administration of paclitaxel.
Breast cancer patients were recruited from the Kyoto University
Hospital (Kyoto, Japan) between May 2014 and August 2015
according to the following inclusion criteria: planned adminis-
tration of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 for one hour) for at least
12
cycles
(cumulative
dose
of
960 mg/m2),
an
Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1, and a
provision of signed informed consent. The exclusion criteria
were as follows: peripheral sensory/motor neuropathy (CTCAE
grade � 2); neuralgia or edema (CTCAE grade � 2); tumor metas-
tasis in bone, soft tissue, or skin of the hands or feet; the ab-
sence of one or more fingers or toes; Raynaud’s symptoms;
peripheral arterial ischemia; hand-foot syndrome; and any
other reasons based on the primary physician’s judgment.
This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto
University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine (G638) in
accordance with Helsinki guidelines and was registered with
the
University
Hospital
Medical
Information
Network
in
February 2014 (UMIN000013398).
Outcome Measures
Primary End Point Assessment: Tactile Disturbance
The primary end point was the incidence of CIPN (any grade),
defined as a decline in tactile sensation from the pretreatment
baseline as assessed by the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament
test (NIHON MEDIX, Chiba, Japan), which is a validated measure
of peripheral neuropathy (13). Patients were blinded and stimu-
lated by 20 grades of nylon filaments. We set the Semmes-
Weinstein monofilament test as the primary end point for two
reasons: 1) it is a robust and patient-blinded assessment, which
will decrease the effects of patient expectancy in this non-
blinded intervention trial; and 2) patients suffer who undergo
paclitaxel therapy from tactile problems more than other types
of sensory or motor problems. (14). Patients experiencing at
least a diminished sensation in response to light touch after a
cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2 were counted as events in the
primary end point assessment.
Thermosensory Disturbance (Objective Symptoms)
Thermosensory disturbance was assessed using a thermal stim-
ulator (Yufu Itonaga, Tokyo, Japan) with 3 �C and 48 �C outputs.
We stimulated the patients’ (with their eyes closed) hands or
feet with hot or cold stimulation and assessed the sensation fol-
lowing the thermal stimulation (normal, delayed, or diminished
compared with baseline). The delayed and diminished sensa-
tions at 12 cycles (cumulative dose, 960 mg/m2) compared with
the pretreatment baseline were classified as events.
Vibration Perception (Objective Symptoms)
Vibration perception at the wrist and ankle was assessed by a C
128-Hz tuning fork (NITI-ON CO, LTD, Chiba, Japan). Patients no
longer feeling vibrations within 10 seconds of application after
12 paclitaxel cycles were considered events. Patients who exhib-
ited abnormal scores at baseline were excluded from the
analysis.
Performance Speed (Objective Symptoms)
Manipulative dexterity was assessed using the grooved peg-
board test (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette IN), a vali-
dated sensory motor speed test (15). The pegboard has 25 holes,
with randomly positioned slots for pegs and keys along one
side. Each peg must be properly rotated to match the hole before
it can be inserted. We measured the time (seconds) required for
the insertion of 25 pegs by each hand (dominant vs nondomi-
nant) and calculated the mean difference from the baseline
score.
Patient-Reported Assessment (Subjective Symptoms)
Subjective symptoms were assessed using the Japanese version
of the PNQ, a validated patient-reported questionnaire on neu-
ropathy and activities of daily living (ADL) that correlates with
quality of life (11). The patient subjectively responded to each
item, grading each as A (no neuropathy), B (mild neuropathy), C
(moderate neuropathy that does not interfere with ADL), D
(moderate neuropathy that interferes with ADL), or E (severe

 neuropathy that interferes with ADL) (11). We assessed the
grades of CIPN, and patients having grades D or E, as severe as
CTCAE grades 2 and 3 (11), were counted as severe CIPN events.
Cryotherapy Tolerability
Adherence to cryotherapy, pain, abnormality of sensation, and
other discomforts due to cryotherapy were checked during ev-
ery intervention.
Electrophysiological Signs
We measured the conduction velocity and action potential am-
plitude of the median nerve using Neuropack X1 (Nihon Kohden
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The current perception thresholds
on the hands and feet were also assessed using a Neurometer
CPT (Neurotron, Towson, MD). Patients exhibiting abnormal val-
ues (16,17) were counted as events.
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel was assessed by plotting the
area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for 24hours,
commencing immediately before administration (AUC0-24). Blood
samples were obtained prior to infusion and immediately before
and one, three, five, and 23hours after the end of the infusion. The
plasma drug concentration was measured by high-performance liq-
uid
chromatography
with
tandem
mass
spectrometry
(18).
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated according to the two-
compartment model using the nonlinear least squares method in
WinNonlin 6.4 (Pharsight, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Furthermore,
we calculated the dose intensity (mg/m2/wk) of paclitaxel as the cu-
mulative dose (mg/m2) divided by the administration period.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was determined by referring to the sizes recorded
in similar previous cryotherapy studies (8). CIPN symptoms are pre-
sented as the incidence rate, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence
interval (CI) of the hands and feet. The time to subjective CIPN was
analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression anal-
ysis. Manipulative dexterity was presented as the mean time differ-
ence (SD). McNemar’s test (tactile, thermal, vibration perception,
and subjective CIPN), log-rank test (time to CIPN events), and
two-sided paired t test between intervention and control sides (ma-
nipulative dexterity) were used for statistical comparison. A P value
of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses
were performed using SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA) and
R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), super-
vised by a statistician. Data quality was ensured by an independent
data center (Medical Research Support Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). All
statistical tests were two-sided.

 paclitaxel dose of 960 mg/m2, leaving 36 patients for the analy-
sis (Figure 1; Table 1). A total of 25 patients completed paclitaxel
therapy at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2, and 11 underwent
chemotherapy at a cumulative dose higher than 960 mg/m2
(maximum ¼ 4080 mg/m2).
Cryotherapy Tolerability
No patients dropped out due to cold intolerance. The most fre-
quently reported adverse events (events / (person*cycle)) were
pain (8.2%), sensory abnormalities (0.4%), and feeling cold
(4.2%). The adverse events diminished immediately during or
after cryotherapy intervention.
Primary End Point
The proportion of hands and feet exhibiting tactile deterioration
were clinically and statistically significantly lower for the inter-
vention side than the control side (hand: 27.8% vs 80.6%, OR ¼
20.00, 95% CI ¼ 3.20 to 828.96, P < .001; foot: 25.0% vs 63.9%, OR ¼
infinite, 95% CI ¼ 3.32 to infinite, P < .001). The proportions in-
clude the patients who experienced CIPN from both the inter-
vention and control sides of the hand and foot (Figure 2A).

Figure 2B presents the incidence of thermosensory deficits.
Patients who exhibited an abnormal thermal sense at baseline
(hands warmth, n ¼ 2; feet warmth, n ¼ 3; and feet cold, n ¼ 4)
were excluded from the analysis. The incidence of a reduced
perception of warmth was clinically and statistically signifi-
cantly lower on the intervention side (hand: 8.8% vs 32.4%, OR ¼
9.00, 95% CI ¼ 1.25 to 394.48, P ¼ .02; foot: 33.4% vs 57.6%, OR ¼

patients who experienced CIPN from both the intervention and
control sides of the hands and feet). In contrast, cold-sense defi-
cits also tended to be numerically lower on the intervention
side but showed no statistical significance (hand: 2.8% vs 13.9%,
OR ¼ inifinite, 95% CI ¼ 0.66 to infinite, P ¼ .13; foot: 12.6% vs

Figure 2. Objective chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) events at a
cumulative dose of 960mg/m2. A) The efficacy of cryotherapy for reducing the pri-
mary end point, incidence of CIPN, was assessed by tactile-sensory deficits on the
monofilament test. Any tactile deterioration from the pretreatment baseline in an in-
tervention or control side hand or foot at a cumulative dose of 960mg/m2 was con-
sidered a CIPN event. The differential incidence between the intervention and
control sides was evaluated using a two-sided McNemar’s test (n ¼ 36). B) Treatment
with cryotherapy reduced thermosensory dysfunction. Only patients who exhibited a
normal sensory threshold at baseline were included (hand: warm, n¼ 34, cold, n¼ 36;
foot: warm, n¼ 33, cold, n¼ 32). Any response delay, response reduction, or thermal
analgesia at a cumulative dose of 960mg/ m2 was considered a CIPN. C) This figure
shows manipulative dexterity deficits. P values were determined by a two-sided
paired t test between the intervention and control side. The solid line denotes the in-
tervention side, and the dotted line indicates the control side (N¼ 36).

tended to be numerically lower on the intervention side but
showed no statistically significant differences between the in-

(Figure 2C). Some patients showed abnormal scores, and there
were no statistically significant differences in nerve degenera-
tion in the electrophysiological signs. Supplementary Figure 1
(available online) shows the incidence overlaps of CIPN in the
hands and feet.
Subjective End Point
For sensory dysfunction, Figure 3 shows the subjective sever-
ity grades of CIPN at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2 (PNQ
grades A–E). The occurrences of CIPN (PNQ grades C–E) were
prevented by cryotherapy (severe CIPN with grades D or E;
hand: 2.8% vs 41.7%, OR ¼ infinite, 95% CI ¼ 3.32 to infinite, P <
.001; foot: 2.8% vs 36.1%, OR ¼ infinite, 95% CI ¼ 2.78 to infinite,
P < .001). A log-rank analysis of Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure 4)
revealed that CIPN also occurred faster on the control side
than on the intervention side (hand: HR ¼ 0.13, 95% CI ¼ 0.05
to 0.34, P < .001; foot: HR ¼ 0.13, 95% CI ¼ 0.04 to 0.38, P ¼ .007).
Only two patients reported motor dysfunction, which lasted
less than one week.
Risk Factors of CIPN
We analyzed the effect of clinical factors on the time to subjec-
tive CIPN events (PNQ � D) on the control side. No statistically
significant differences were found for the time to events be-
tween the low AUC0 � 24 group, with the low AUC means below
the median value (group mean ¼ 6.6 mg�h/mL, SD ¼ 0.5 mg�h/mL;
total cohort median ¼ 7.2 mg�h/mL) and the high AUC0 � 24
group (mean ¼ 8.3 mg�h/mL, SD ¼ 1.4 mg�h/mL) (hand: P ¼ .54,
foot: P ¼ .56) (Figure 5A). The dose intensity varied because of
the results of temporary delays due to chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia. Symptoms occurred statistically earlier in the
high–dose intensity group (mean ¼ 75.0 mg/m2/wk, SD ¼
4.8 mg/m2/wk) above the median (68.6 mg/m2/wk) than in the
low–dose
intensity
group
(mean
¼
56.6 mg/m2/wk,
SD
¼
7.0 mg/m2/wk; hand: P ¼ .001, foot: P ¼ .003) (Figure 5B). We also
examined the effects of other factors; however, none were sta-
tistically significant risk factors for CIPN (Supplementary Table
1, availale online).
Electrophysiological Signs
For the incidence of electrophysiological signs, patients exhibit-
ing a normal sense at the pretreatment baseline were included
in the analysis (median nerve conduction velocity, n ¼ 18; me-
dian nerve action potential amplitude, n ¼ 14; current percep-
tion thresholds, hands, n ¼ 11, feet, n ¼ 8); they showed no
statistically significant differences between intervention and
control sides (nerve conduction velocity: 5.5% vs 5.5%, OR ¼
1.00, 95% CI ¼ 0.01 to 78.50, P ¼ 1.00; action potential: 28.5% vs
28.5%, OR ¼ 1.00, 95% CI ¼ 0.01 to 78.50, P ¼ 1.00; current percep-
tion threshold; hand: 18.1% vs 27.2%, OR ¼ inifinite, 95% CI ¼
0.03 to inifinite, P ¼ 1.00, foot: 25.0% vs 25.0%, OR ¼ 1.00, 95% CI
¼ 0.01 to 78.50, P ¼ 1.00) . All P values were analyzed using

divided by the median AUC (7.2 mg�h/mL). The solid line denotes the high-AUC group, and the dotted line indicates the low-AUC group. B) This figure presents high/low
dose intensity (mg/m2/wk). The low–dose intensity group (mean ¼ 56.6 mg/m2/wk, SD ¼ 6.7 mg/m2/wk) and high–dose intensity group (mean ¼ 75.0 mg/m2/wk,
SD ¼ 4.8 mg/m2/wk) were divided by the median dose intensity (68.6 mg/ m2/wk). The solid line represents the high–dose intensity group, and the dotted line denotes
the low–dose intensity group. A two-sided log-rank test was used to calculate the P values.

 Discussion
Our findings support the efficacy of cryotherapy for CIPN pre-
vention, as evidenced by a clinically and statistically significant
reduction in patient-reported subjective symptoms, diminished
objective signs (tactile and thermosensory), and prevention of
manipulative dexterity. The development of subjective CIPN
symptoms was clinically and statistically significantly delayed
during the course of the paclitaxel treatment, the occurrence of
subjective CIPN at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2 was almost
completely prevented, and the CIPN incidence as assessed by
other objective modalities tended to be lower on the interven-
tion side. Because the self-controlled design can reduce the
effects of unknown potential confounders to levels lower than
expected in randomized clinical trials, data consistency among
the multiple assessments and large effect size, as exampled by
a small hazard ratio, support the robustness of our conclusions
despite the limited sample size (19). Furthermore, no patients
dropped out due to cold intolerance in response to cryotherapy.
Our study had several limitations. First, placebo effects are
inevitable. To minimize differences in expectancy between the
intervention and control sides, we supported a subjective symp-
tom evaluation with objective measures. One potential con-
founder is that the control side may exhibit higher skin
temperatures concomitant with a homeostatic whole-body
temperature increase due to cooling on the intervention side;
however, this influence was likely minimal because the inci-
dence of CIPN symptoms on the control sides did not deviate
substantially from that reported in previous studies (1,2). A
comparison between patients with and without intervention
would control for this physiological response. Second, the non-
dominant hand and foot always acted as the control, as in pre-
vious studies of cryotherapy (7,8). To the best of our knowledge,
there have been no reports on bilateral differences in CIPN
symptoms (either subjective or objective). Impairments in ADL
are likely less severe when CIPN occurs in the nondominant
hand due to easier compensation using the dominant hand.
Third, we did not plan to follow the patients after the comple-
tion of paclitaxel treatment because postpaclitaxel therapy
could impact the sensory status. In this study, patients under-
went surgery (n ¼ 10), radiotherapy (n ¼ 8), hormonal therapy,
and/or additional chemotherapy (n ¼ 18) following paclitaxel
therapy. The 30 patients who returned to our clinic within a me-
dian of 6.1 weeks (2 to 126 weeks) stated that there was no wors-
ening of CIPN symptoms after the cessation of paclitaxel
treatment. While previous studies have suggested that the de-
velopment of additional CIPN signs or coasting is relatively rare
after cessation of chemotherapy (20,21), long-term follow-up
would reveal the effects of cryotherapy on the natural course of
CIPN signs and symptoms.
Compression therapy using surgical gloves modestly pre-
vents CTCAE grade 2 or higher sensory and motor peripheral
neuropathy with four cycles of triweekly nanoparticle albumin-
bound paclitaxel (22). Compression therapy and cryotherapy
share an analogous mechanism of reduced drug exposure due
to vasoconstriction during paclitaxel infusion. The low temper-
ature associated with cryotherapy may also decrease the uptake
of paclitaxel and damage of neurons or mechanotransductions,
which might be related to decreased CIPN (20,23).
Total drug exposure may also enhance the risk of CIPN. In a
previous study, the CIPN incidence increased with AUC and
time
above
the
paclitaxel
concentration
threshold
(24).
Although we found clinically and statistically significant differ-
ences in the cumulative dose to events between the high- and
low-dose intensity groups, no differences were found between
high- and low-AUC groups with a uniform dosage and relatively
small variability in pharmacokinetics. Any other risk factor
analyses have low power, and we could not identify any correla-
tion between CIPN occurrence and the baseline assessments.
We conclude that cyrotherapy is a simple, safe, and effective
strategy for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer un-
dergoing paclitaxel treatment. Cyrotherapy could support the
delivery of optimal chemotherapy by preventing a dose delay or
reduction, as well as inhibiting the deterioration of quality of
life in cancer patients during and after treatment.
