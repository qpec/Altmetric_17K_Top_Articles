With more than 240 million people infected, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major health
concern. The inability to mimic the complexity of the liver using cell lines and regular primary
human hepatocyte (PHH) cultures pose significant limitations for studying host/pathogen
interactions. Here, we describe a 3D microfluidic PHH system permissive to HBV infection,
which can be maintained for at least 40 days. This system enables the recapitulation of all
steps of the HBV life cycle, including the replication of patient-derived HBV and the main-
tenance of HBV cccDNA. We show that innate immune and cytokine responses following
infection with HBV mimic those observed in HBV-infected patients, thus allowing the dis-
section of pathways important for immune evasion and validation of biomarkers. Additionally,
we demonstrate that the co-culture of PHH with other non-parenchymal cells enables the
identification of the cellular origin of immune effectors, thus providing a valuable preclinical
platform for HBV research.

lobally, more than 240 million people are chronically
infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)1. HBV infection is
associated with the development of liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV belongs to the family of Hepad-
naviridae and comprises of a small (3.2 kb), partially double-
stranded DNA genome, which persists as covalently closed, cir-
cular (ccc)DNA episome. This cccDNA is the transcriptional
template for pregenomic (pg)RNA and subgenomic (sg)RNA
species. HBV genome amplification includes the reverse tran-
scription of pgRNA within assembling progeny virions2. This step
is the target of the majority of drugs currently in clinical practice,
but since this represents a late stage during infection, treatment
with nucleo(s)tide analogs including lamivudine, entecavir, or
tenofovir do not result in the elimination of cccDNA. Studying
the life cycle of HBV has been complicated mostly due to the lack
of suitable in vitro models recapitulating all steps of the viral life
cycle in hepatocytes and the difficulty of modeling physiologically
intact host cells for HBV replication.
Hepatocytes, which are the target cell for HBV, form complex
three-dimensional (3D) structures in vivo, lining the hepatic
sinusoids3. Despite the ability to isolate viable primary human
hepatocyte (PHH) from liver resections, the in vitro cultures
remain challenging, mainly due to their de-differentiation as
evidenced by their loss of cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) activity and
morphological changes within days of culture4–6. This has led to
the development of several culture models, which better support
hepatocyte differentiation, notably the use of fetal hepatoblast
cultures7 as well as the micropatterning of PHH and non-hepatic
stromal cells8. Although these culture models recapitulate certain
aspects of HBV infection, they are not susceptible to patient-
derived HBV isolates, only supporting transiently low levels of
infection or require immunomodulation in order to stably
replicate HBV8. Other model systems, including single-channel
microfluidic hepatocyte cultures9 and organoid cultures10 are
promising in their development, though they have not been
evaluated regarding their susceptibility to HBV. Additionally,
they do not fulfill the requirement for multiplexing, which is
essential for preclinical evaluation. Notably, very high viral titers
are required to initiate infection in most culture systems, often
necessitating multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of up to 4 × 104
HBV genome equivalents (GE)/cell, the presence of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance
virus binding11, or the use of immunomodulators including
Janus-activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of tran-
scription factor (STAT) inhibitors8. Most studies utilizing PHH
cultures for HBV infection require analysis after up to 15 days, at
which time the majority of PHH have already dedifferentiated.
Even though the initial infection might have been in PHH, the
changing phenotype of cells during culture makes interpretation
of results difficult. In vivo however, HBV can be transmitted by
low
pathogen
numbers
and
in
the
absence
of
immunomodulation12, 13. This raises the question as to whether a
more natural host cell environment including a physiological liver
architecture resembling liver sinusoids would impact the sus-
ceptibility to infection of PHH with HBV.
Finally, HBV infection has been shown to go largely undetected
by the hosts’ immune system, explaining the high viral titers and
absence of immune-mediated liver injury during the acute phase
of infection. Early experiments in chimpanzees have shown that
HBV does not induce a potent innate immune response13, and
recent reports indicate that HBV might evade detection by
interfering with several innate immune-sensing pathways14. Most
hepatic cell lines and primary cells, however, alter the expression
levels of innate immune sensors, which might alter the ability of
HBV proteins to interfere with host signal transduction. Indeed, a
recent report describes dependency of HBV replication on the
absence of a type I interferon (IFN) response8, which had not
been observed in vivo13.
Here we describe a novel 3D microfluidic PHH culture model
for HBV, based on a previously developed platform15–17. We
demonstrate that this culture system recapitulates the hepatic
sinusoid microarchitecture including functional bile canaliculi
and complete cell polarization. In addition to maintaining stable
high levels of albumin secretion, Cyp450 activity as shown by the
expression, and activity of phase I, II, and III enzymes for at least
40 days, PHH become susceptible to cell culture- and patient-
derived HBV isolates at low MOI and show hallmarks of innate
immune activation observed in HBV-infected patients. Compar-
ing this platform to other advanced primary hepatocyte culture
models (e.g., hepatic spheroids18 or self-assembling co-cultures
(SACC PHH)19), we show that the 3D PHH cultures enable
infection studies at 10,000-fold lower MOI than other advanced
culture models. Furthermore, utilizing co-cultures of PHH and
primary Kupffer cells (KC) we provide direct evidence that KC
fail to recognize HBV infection and do not participate in an early
innate immune response. However, upon exogenous stimulation,
KC rapidly induce interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-α, which may contribute to the observed suppression of
HBV replication.
This preclinical platform opens the door for the identification
of biomarkers, dissection of host genetics, and its impact on HBV
infection as well as modeling drug treatment responses. The
versatility of this novel model system is furthermore underlined
by the ability to co-culture innate immune cells including KC,
which phenocopy host responses observed in HBV-infected
patients.
Results
Hepatocytes form hepatic microtissues in 3D culture. To model
the organization of PHH on liver sinusoids, we used microfluidic
recirculation through collagen-coated polystyrene scaffolds see-
ded with PHH (Fig. 1a). The recirculation of culture media at a
speed of 1 μL/s provides nutrients and oxygen to the cultures at
stable levels, which is one of the main obstacles of conventional
two-dimensional (2D) PHH cultures15, 16, 20. In 3D PHH and 3D
spheroid cultures, PHH retain viability and exhibit stable mor-
phology and phenotype for at least 40 days (Fig. 1b, c) in contrast
to conventional static 2D PHH cultures and SACC PHH (com-
posed by PHH and the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3-J2),
which show morphological de-differentiation over 10–13 days.
3D PHH cultures form viable hepatic microtissues (Fig. 1b, c) and
produce approximately 10-fold higher levels of the hepatocyte-
specific marker albumin, compared to 2D or SACC PHH after
2 weeks of culture (Fig. 1d, e). However, albumin and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in 3D PHH cultures are comparable
to 3D spheroid cultures and remain stable over time (Supple-
mentary Figs. 1, 2 and Supplementary Movie 1).
To further characterize the metabolic functionality of 3D PHH
cultures, we compared the mRNA levels of key Cyp450 including
phase I, II, and III enzymes (HNMT, CYP2A6, ABCB11,
SLC22A1, CYP2A13, GSTP1) between PHH grown in 2D, 3D
spheroid, SACC PHH, and 3D PHH cultures (Fig. 2a). Overall,
cultures grown in 2D exhibited lower or absent levels of Cyp450
genes following 2 weeks of culture (Fig. 2b). Only 3D spheroids
and 3D PHH cultures demonstrate Cyp450 levels comparable to
freshly thawed PHH. Compared to 2D PHH, 3D PHH cultures
are also longitudinally stable in their Cyp450 and HBV entry
factor gene expression (NTCP, ASGPR) (Fig. 2b). To test the
metabolic activity of 3D PHH, the biological activity of CYP3A in
six different hepatocyte donors was evaluated after 7 days of
culture
and
shows
uniform
CYP3A
activity
(Fig.
2c).

 Additionally, the ability of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 to
metabolize their respective substrates was evaluated 7, 14, and
21 days post-seeding of PHH and suggests the maintenance of
functionally intact PHH (Fig. 2d). Stable secretion of DPPIV/
CD26, a marker of bile canaliculi21 and staining of cultures with
5-CDF furthermore demonstrates that hepatic bile canaliculi are
functional

 (TAPA-1, CD81), connexin 32 (GJB1), integrin β1 (ITGB1), and
zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) 26 days post-seeding confirm
the presence of tight junctions, which are prime indicators for
polarized growth of PHH (Fig. 2i, Supplementary Movies 2–5).
Tissue formation and longitudinal maintenance of hepatic
phenotype are additionally independent of hepatocyte donor,
age, or genetic background.
3D hepatocytes support long-term HBV infection. To evaluate
whether 3D PHH can be infected with HBV, cultures were
incubated with patient-derived HBV at an MOI of 100 GE/cell
followed by detection of HBcAg and HBsAg by immuno-
fluorescence 10 days postinfection, which indicates that the
majority of cells are infected (Fig. 3a). HBcAg staining further-
more confirmed that infection was sustained for at least 22 days
(Supplementary Movie 6). Direct comparison of the susceptibility
of 3D PHH, 3D spheroid, and SACC PHH cultures to different
MOIs of sucrose-purified HepDE19-derived HBV furthermore
demonstrates that, even though all culture models can be infected
with 500 GE/cell (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Fig. 4), only 3D PHH
cultures still readily become infected, when using as little as 0.05
GE/cell as confirmed by the secretion of HBsAg and HBV DNA
(Fig. 3c, d). HBsAg and HBV DNA production was stable for at
least 22 days postinfection and, for the first time, demonstrates
that 0.05 GE/cell results in stable HBV infection in vitro, even
though observable HBsAg secretion at an MOI of 0.05 GE/cell
was under the limit of quantification. Despite the ability to detect
HBcAg-positive cells in 3D spheroids infected with 50 GE/cell of
HBV (Supplementary Movie 7), this infection does not result in
sufficient HBV DNA secretion or pgRNA accumulation to be
detected by the assays used. In contrast to previously described
culture systems for HBV8, 19, 3D PHH culture initiation and
maintenance of HBV infection does not require the use of PEG or
DMSO8, 19, does not depend on inhibition of cell-intrinsic innate
immune responses8, and is independent of host genetic differ-
ences between hepatocyte donors (Supplementary Fig. 5a) or the
source of patient-derived HBV (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
HBV entry into 3D PHH is still highly dependent on NTCP
since preincubation of cultures with a myristoylated preS1
peptide (2–48)22 resulted in an inhibition of HBsAg secretion
of 90%. Furthermore, depletion of cellular heparan sulfate using
heparinase III treatment prior to infection completely abolishes
susceptibility to HBV infection, indicating that the attachment of
HBV to cellular heparan sulfate is essential to establish infection
(Fig. 3e). Additionally, infection of 3D PHH cultures leads to the
accumulation and maintenance of sgRNA and pgRNA (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4) as well as cccDNA at approximately 2 copies per
cell (Fig. 3f). Treatment of cultures with IFNα demonstrated that
cccDNA levels are unaffected, whereas HBV DNA and HBsAg
secretion are inhibited by IFNα (Fig. 3g, h), as previously
reported23. Longitudinal HBsAg and HBV DNA release from 3D
PHH cultures infected with patient-derived HBV resulted in a
steady increase of both viral markers as well as replicative
intermediates (Fig. 3i, Supplementary Fig. 4). When treated with
the HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor tenofovir alafena-
mide (TAF), HBV DNA secretion rapidly decreased, whereas
antigen expression remained stable, indicating that similar to
HBV-infected patients, RT inhibitors are non-curative (Fig. 3j).
This demonstrates that 3D PHH cultures are susceptible to HBV
at more physiological inoculum doses than 2D PHH, SACC
PHH, 3D spheroid cultures, or hepatoma cell lines overexpressing
NTCP24. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-term nature
of 3D PHH cultures enables, for the first time, the evaluation of
sequential treatments with clinically used drugs (e.g., IFNα, TAF)
and novel drug candidates, including Toll-like receptor (TLR)
agonists (GS-9620) and epigenetic modulators (C646) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6). HBeAg is effectively suppressed and HBV DNA
decline is more pronounced in sequential treatments using IFNα
and TAF in contrast to monotherapy (Supplementary Fig. 6a–d).
Using monotherapy with either IFNα or C646 followed by an
untreated follow-up time, we furthermore show that both control
HBV DNA release (Supplementary Fig. 6g), whereas only C646
additionally reduces the levels of secreted HBeAg and intracel-
lular cccDNA (Supplementary Fig. 6f, h).
This validates 3D PHH cultures as a robust preclinical platform
for evaluating novel treatment combinations and subsequent
treatment studies.
HBV suppresses baseline innate immune activation. Since
previous data indicate that HBV infection in vivo fails to elicit a
potent innate immune response13, we aimed at dissecting the
early host response to HBV infection in 3D PHH cultures. To
assess whether 3D PHH cultures maintain the expression levels of
key pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and signaling media-
tors, we compared the longitudinal mRNA expression levels of
TLRs and cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensors as well as signaling
mediators in different hepatocyte donors in 2D and 3D PHH
cultures and their levels remained stable for at least 10 days when
compared to freshly thawed PHH (Supplementary Fig. 7). Next,
we performed phospho-kinase arrays, evaluating the activation of
key innate immune pathways by HBV antigen and their sup-
pression by HBV infection (Fig. 4a, b). In particular, we utilized a
myristoylated preS1 peptide25 to dissect the contribution of HBV
binding to its cognate receptor and any other potential PRRs and
compared this to productive HBV infection. For this purpose,
PHH grown in 3D cultures were either left untreated, treated with
the indicated concentration of preS1, infected with 100 GE/cell
HBV, or with a combination of HBV infection and preS1 for 24 h.
PreS1 peptides result in a pronounced activation of p38, c-Jun N-
terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)/2/3, extracellular signal–regulated
kinase 1 (ERK1)/2, and STAT2 by phosphorylation 24 h post
addition to 3D PHH cultures, whereas HBV infection of 3D PHH
cultures only induces detectable levels of ERK1/2 but not p38,
JNK1/2/3, or STAT2, indicating that HBV infection interferes
with their activation. Strikingly, HBV infection furthermore
overrides the potential of preS1 peptides to induce the afore-
mentioned
innate
immune
signaling
mediators,
since
co-
administration of HBV-infected 3D PHH cultures with preS1
peptides fails to induce p38, JNK1/2/3, or STAT2. This HBV-
mediated interference of innate immune signal transduction
furthermore translates to a lack of transcriptional activation of
IFN in HBV-infected 3D PHH cultures over time (Fig. 4c, e).

 Upon infection with HBV, both, type I and III IFN transcripts
were suppressed to 10% of the levels observed in uninfected
cultures, suggesting an active role for HBV in suppressing innate
immune activation. This lack of IFN induction translates to a lack
of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression at baseline,
including CXCL10, IFI27, Viperin, IFITM3, Mx1, and OasL fol-
lowing HBV infection (Fig. 4d, f). Cells, however, retain their
responsiveness to exogenous IFNα, as indicated by the induction
of ISGs (Fig. 4l), suggesting that HBV exerts its immunomodu-
latory function prior to the induction of IFN. However, HBV
infection suppresses the expression of TLRs 1, 2, and 8; RIG-I;
and IRF3 (Fig. 4g–k) 10 days postinfection, suggesting that, in
addition to the direct impact on signal transduction, HBV
impairs innate immune responses at the transcriptional level.
This suppression of innate immune sensors and mediators was
completely
reversed
by
treatment
with
IFNα.

 investigate as to whether the observed suppression of innate
immune activation is directly exerted by HBV, we compared
induction of cytokine responses following infection with HBV or
with ultraviolet (UV)-, heat-, or paraformaldehyde-inactivated
HBV. UV inactivation of HBV abolishes the block in innate
immune activation, as evident by the increased levels of IFI27 and
IFITM3 mRNA in the absence of HBV replication 10 days
postinfection, supporting that direct immune evasion of HBV
occurs early during infection (Fig. 4m–o). Even though all inac-
tivation conditions used resulted in complete loss of infectivity,
the ability of a viral antigen to exert immune activation in 3D
PHH cultures depends on conformational integrity since heat-
induced antigen denaturation does not induce potent immune
activation.

 3D PHH phenocopy host responses seen in HBV-infected
patients. To determine whether the host response to HBV
infection could be translated to that observed in HBV-infected
patients, we measured global changes in chemokine and cytokine
responses in 3D PHH cultures following HBV infection, utilizing
Cytokine XL antibody arrays, which simultaneously determine
changes in over 100 cytokines and chemokines. As evident, HBV
infection does not induce a pronounced proinflammatory
response as evidenced by the lack of induction of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-
12, and the majority of other cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 5a).
To compare host responses in HBV-infected 3D PHH cultures to
serum samples from HBV-infected patients (Supplementary
Table 2), we performed Luminex protein analysis. Even though
3D cultures solely contain PHH and no other cell types, levels of
IL-8, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-3α, SerpinE1, and
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) showed significant
elevation on the protein level in HBV-infected 3D PHH cultures
as well as in the sera of HBV-infected patients (Fig. 5b, c, f, g).
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which was highly
induced in 3D PHH cultures, was not elevated in the sera of
HBV-infected patients, which may be due to the short radius of
action of VEGF, restricting it to the liver (Fig. 5e). C-X-C motif
chemokine
ligand 10 (CXCL10),
which is produced
pre-
dominantly by plasmacytoid dendritic cells26, demonstrated an
inverse correlation with HBsAg and HBeAg and levels detected
are far lower than those observed in HBV-infected patients,
further supporting that in PHH, ISG induction is inhibited by
HBV (Fig. 5d). Notably, both in 3D PHH cultures and HBV-
infected patient sera, the levels of IL-8 and MIP-3α correlated
with HBsAg levels, suggesting a direct effect of HBV infection. In
3D PHH cultures, the direct correlation also exists with secreted
HBeAg levels. These factors were also shown to be elevated in the
serum of patients infected with HBV in clinical studies27–30.
Taken together, these results indicate that 3D PHH accurately
recapitulate host responses observed in patient samples and
earlier studies using chimpanzees13, validating 3D PHH cultures
for the identification and dissection of host/pathogen interactions
and biomarkers.
Co-cultures with KC do not impact HBV infection. Even
though 3D PHH cultures are able to recapitulate many of the host
responses described in humans, many interactions of HBV and its
surrounding host involves other liver-resident cells. It has pre-
viously been shown that IL-6, which is predominantly produced
by macrophages, plays an important role in suppressing HBV
transcriptional activity31, 32. However, no expression of IL-6 or
TNF-α was detectable even though HBV-infected patients exhibit
elevated levels of both cytokines (Fig. 6). To address the impact of
non-parenchymal cell populations within the liver on HBV
infection, we performed co-cultures of 3D PHH and primary KC
cells. We used PHH monocultures and co-cultures with a PHH:
KC cell ratio of 10:1 and analyzed the cytokine and chemokine
secretome 13 days post-seeding using Cytokine XL antibody
arrays (Fig. 6a) and longitudinal cell viability via albumin
secretion and LDH release (Supplementary Figs. 2, 8). In contrast
to 3D PHH, 3D PHH/KC co-cultures stably release EMMPRIN
(CD147), IGFBP-2, IL-1ra, CXCL10/IP-10, MIP-3α, matrix
metalloproteinase-9 and Osteopontin (OPN) (Fig. 6a). Long-
itudinal analysis of OPN expression levels in monocultures and
co-cultures confirmed that KC remain viable for at least 13 days
post-seeding (Fig. 6b). To evaluate the functionality of KC, we
stimulated 3D PHH and 3D PHH/KC co-cultures with 1 μg/mL
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 11 days post-seeding and analyzed the
protein levels of IL-6 and TNF-α at day 12. As expected, only co-
cultures secreted high levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, indicating that
KC remain functional throughout the culture period (Fig. 6c, d).
Infection of 3D PHH and 3D co-cultures with 100 GE/cell HBV
resulted in a pronounced acute phase response, as evident by high
levels of C-reactive protein only in PHH/KC co-cultures (Fig. 6e),
which has been shown to be produced by macrophages33.
Comparing
virological
characteristics
of
HBV
infection
revealed that the secreted levels of HBsAg and HBeAg, and
levels of pgRNA and sgRNA, are identical in monocultures and
co-cultures (Fig. 6f–k). Treatment of both monocultures and co-
cultures with IFNα resulted in the reduction of viral replication to
similar extents as indicated by the reduction of secreted HBsAg,
HBeAg, pgRNA, and sgRNA (Fig. 6f–k). In contrast to PHH
monocultures, the presence of KC abolished the HBV-induced
suppression of IFN production (Fig. 6l). This elevation in type I
and III IFN was, however, likely to originate from the KC, since
HBV infection in PHH/KC co-cultures still failed to elicit a potent
ISG response (Fig. 6m), suggesting that, even though they remain
functional in culture, they do not actively interfere with HBV or
its ability to subvert innate immune responses.
Exogenous stimulation of KC suppresses HBV replication.
Since KCs do neither affect HBV replication nor mount proin-
flammatory immune responses, we evaluated as to whether KCs
still respond to exogenous stimuli. 3D PHH cultures themselves
do not produce any IL-6 and TNF-α in response to infection with
HBV since these cytokines are KC specific (Fig. 7a). However,
HBV-infected patients exhibit elevated serum levels of IL-6 and
TNF-α, suggesting proinflammatory immune responses (Fig. 7b,
c). Analysis of the secretion of cytokines and chemokines revealed
that HBV-infected co-cultures, similar to 3D PHH monocultures,
do not secrete IL-6 and TNF-α in response to HBV infection
(Fig. 7d, e). However, when exogenous stimulation is applied via
LPS even 8 days after infection with HBV, KC rapidly secrete IL-6
and TNF-α (Fig. 7d, e). Interestingly, LPS-induced IL-6 responses
were significantly stronger in HBV-infected compared to unin-
fected cultures, suggesting that, even though HBV effectively
blocks most innate immune activation in PHH, it is not able to
subvert exogenous activation of non-parenchymal cells. This LPS-
induced innate immune activation is furthermore able to suppress
HBV replication, as determined by reduced HBsAg secretion
(Fig. 7f) in the absence of LPS-induced cytotoxicity or IL-6-
induced proliferation, as determined by albumin secretion (Sup-
plementary Fig. 8), suggesting that exogenous antigen may be

demonstrates that 3D PHH/KC co-cultures can be utilized to
dissect the contribution of individual liver-resident cell types to
antiviral responses against HBV.
Discussion
The study of HBV infection has been complicated in the past by
the unavailability of model systems allowing the study of disease
pathogenesis and limiting research to using patient samples or
animal models. Even though many advanced culture platforms
for PHH have been developed in recent years9, 10, 34–39, no
information is yet available on their susceptibility to HBV
infection. The discovery of NTCP as entry factor into human
hepatocytes has paved the way to facilitating molecular studies of
the complete HBV life cycle, but the downregulation of innate
immune factors in cell lines restricts the study of host/pathogen
interactions and disease pathogenesis to PHH cultures. Most 2D
PHH cultures, even though permitting short-term studies, are
difficult to maintain and rapidly de-differentiate over the course
of several days11. Here we describe a novel 3D PHH culture
system facilitating the study of HBV under physiological condi-
tions and compare it to conventional 2D PHH, 3D hepatic
spheroid, and SACC PHH cultures. The constant recirculation of
nutrients and oxygenated medium leads to the formation of
hepatocyte microtissues, which are metabolically and functionally
stable for at least 40 days post-seeding, allowing the study of long-
term effects of HBV on PHH and the analysis of sequential drug
treatments in the context of HBV infection. Microtissues are
characterized by the formation of a liver-like microarchitecture
including tight junctions and bile canaliculi, which localizes host
factors at correct cellular surfaces. This is especially important for
HBV, where receptors are distinctly expressed on basolateral
hepatocyte surfaces24. The 2D nature of PHH cultures results in
only limited cell polarization with random cell surface distribu-
tion of entry factors, potentially explaining the poor susceptibility
of 2D cultures to HBV infection11. The nearly equal amounts of
NTCP mRNA in 2D and 3D PHH cultures would suggest that
infection should be possible to equal extent, given that mRNA
expression correlates with protein expression. This raises the
question whether NTCP and ASGPR represent the sole receptors
for HBV on PHH.
It has been previously shown that most 2D systems for HBV,
including HepG2/hNTCP, HepaRG, and 2D PHH cultures,
require high inoculation titers to establish infection, limiting their

 use to study patient-derived viral isolates. Even using more
advanced model systems incorporating the micropatterning of
PHH on collagen and the use of murine feeder cells only mar-
ginally raises the hepatocyte susceptibility to HBV infection, while
requiring active suppression of innate immune signaling path-
ways in order to detect significant levels of HBV antigen. We
demonstrate that 3D spheroids susceptibility to HBV infection is
lost below 500 GE/cell of inoculum, even though some HBcAg-
positive cells are still detectable at MOI 50. Most of these HBV
infection systems furthermore rely on the addition of large
quantities of DMSO, PEG11, or immunomodulatory agents8 to
detect infection. This is in stark contrast to HBV infection in vivo,
where minimal HBV inocula are sufficient to establish infec-
tion13. We demonstrate that hepatocyte polarization is critical for
their susceptibility to HBV infection since as little as 0.05 GE/cell
can initiate stable infection for at least 22 days, whereas the same
HBV inoculum does not result in any detectable HBV infection
using 2D cultures, 3D spheroids, or SACC PHH cultures. Nota-
bly, all tested PHH donors and HBV patient samples were able to
initiate and maintain infection in 3D PHH cultures, independent
of whether they were HBeAg-positive or -negative. In contrast to
other HBV culture systems, HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg
secretion are rapid and stable over time, resulting in the accu-
mulation of cccDNA. Every hepatocyte in infected cultures har-
bors approximately two cccDNA molecules, which is similar to
the number previously reported in human liver biopsies. Even
though infected cultures respond to IFNα treatment with reduced
HBV DNA and HBsAg secretion, cccDNA levels remain largely
unaffected.
Since, in contrast to traditional 2D PHH cultures, all tested
PHH donors are susceptible to infection using this 3D PHH
culture system, this opens the door for comparative studies on
host genetic effects on HBV. Especially in light of a thus far
poorly understood contribution of IL-28b genotypes to HBV
infection outcome, the ability to compare PHH donors with
differential innate immune responses might reveal important
mechanisms of immune control40. Most importantly, 3D PHH
cultures can be used for infections with patient-derived HBV,
which could not be achieved using 2D PHH cultures or HepG2/
hNTCP. This offers the unique opportunity for comparative
analysis
of
different
HBV
genotypes,
HBeAg-positive
and
-negative isolates, drug-resistant strains, and mutants with dele-
tions within the HBV genome. Similar to other HBV culture
systems, including HepG2/NTCP cells, HepaRG cells, 2D PHH
cultures, 3D spheroids, and SACC PHH cultures, no viral spread
to neighboring, uninfected cells, was visible, since low MOI
infections failed to spread through the cultures, as evidenced by
HBsAg and HBV DNA secretions not reaching levels observed in
high MOI infections. This indicates that additional host factors or
cell populations may be involved in the spread of HBV, which
ultimately results in >80% of the human liver becoming infected
with HBV.
The ability of 3D PHH cultures to maintain hepatocyte mor-
phology for extended periods of time additionally enables the
evaluation
of
subsequent
treatments

 combination clinical trials. As previously demonstrated in clinical
trials41, 42, sequential treatment with IFNα and a nucleotide
analog resulted in a more profound viral suppression at earlier
time points compared to either monotherapy. Furthermore, using
recently described epigenetic modulators43 we demonstrate that
inhibition of p300 using C646 results not only in an early
suppression of HBV antigen expression and HBV DNA release
but also reduces the levels of cccDNA.
Most hepatoma cell lines as well as PHH in 2D either alter their
expression of key innate immune receptors or loose expression
rapidly following plating on collagen-coated plates, hindering the
evaluation of physiological host responses. As we show, PHH

 expression levels of innate immune receptors and downstream
effectors, enabling the study of host/pathogen interactions. HBV,
however, elicits minimal-to-no innate immune activation in 3D
PHH cultures, despite the stable expression of all relevant DNA
and RNA sensors usually required for viral sensing. This may be
mainly due to effective innate immune inhibition by HBV44–47,
including the HBV RT48 and the X protein49, but might also stem
from hepatocytes not being professional pathogen sensing and
antigen-presenting cells. Since HBV specifically evolved to evade
pattern recognition, initiated by HBV components, which would
activate innate immune responses, the observed dependence on
secondary stimuli through PRRs detecting bacterial products
could be attributed to a lack of evolutionary pressure to evade
bacteria-initiated innate immunity. HBV infection in 3D PHH
cultures results in active suppression of type I and III IFN pro-
duction and subsequent reduction of ISG expression. Interest-
ingly, this extends to CXCL10, which has previously been shown
to be induced by HBV in 2D PHH cultures50. This may indicate
that HBV actively subverts CXCL10 production and the lower
infection efficiency of 2D PHH cultures allows for its production
by uninfected bystander cells. However, HBV infection does not
interfere with IFN signaling since IFNα readily induces high
levels of ISGs, irrespective of whether they are infected with HBV
or not. The active suppression of innate immune responses by
HBV is furthermore supported by the loss of innate immune
evasion following inactivation of HBV. Nevertheless, HBV
infection of 3D PHH results in alterations in the cytokine and
chemokine fingerprint of infected cultures, which correlates with
those observed in HBV-infected patients. In addition to allowing
the identification of biomarkers correlating with HBV infection in
PHH, 3D cultures are amenable to co-cultures of PHH with other
non-parenchymal cells, in particular human KC. For the first
time, this enables the dissection of the cellular origin of bio-
markers associated with HBV infection. Remarkably, KC fail to
respond to HBV antigen by themselves, resulting in uncontrolled
replication of HBV, even though they elicit a potent acute phase
response. KC secrete large quantities of IL-6 and TNF-α only in
response to a secondary stimulus like LPS, which in turn actively
suppress HBV replication. This suggests that HBV efficiently
silences not only hepatocyte-intrinsic innate immune activation
processes but also effectively evades the immunosurveillance
function of liver-resident macrophages. Recently, several immu-
nomodulatory functions of HBV proteins have been identified44.
Among them, several are directly targeting innate immune acti-
vation pathways, and even though HBV-infected patients exhibit
elevated levels of both IL-6 and TNF-α, further investigation of
the impact of HBV or HBV proteins directly on KC is needed.
Taken together, we provide a novel culture model for HBV that
allows inoculation of PHH with low-titer patient-derived HBV. In
addition to facilitating the study of host and viral genetics, this
platform also enables the dissection of complex host/pathogen
interactions and validation of biomarkers of HBV infection,
treatment responses, or potential curative therapeutic interven-
tions using PHH/KC co-cultures, which cannot be studied using
other in vitro or even in vivo xenograft systems. This opens the
door to further expanding this culture platform to other non-
parenchymal cells to form a “liver on a chip”, applicable not only
to the study of HBV but also to other hepatotropic pathogens,
liver biology, and drug development.
Methods
Cells. HepDE19 cells were kindly provided by Haitao Guo (Indiana University, IN,
USA) and were maintained as described51. Cryopreserved PHH were provided by
QPS Laboratories (Newark, NJ, USA) and Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and KC were from Life Technologies (Supplementary Table 1). HepG2 cells
(ATCC, Middlesex, UK) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Thermofisher, Paisley, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Gibco, Thermofisher), 100 IU/mL Penicillin, and 100 μg/mL Strep-
tomycin (Merck, Millipore, Hertfordshire, UK) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.
PHH and KC were removed from liquid nitrogen and thawed according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, PHH were resuspended in prewarmed thawing
medium (QPS Laboratories). PHH were centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min and
resuspended in Williams E medium (WEM) supplemented with Thawing/Plating
Supplement Pack (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) that consisted of 5% FBS, 1 μM Dex-
amethasone, 100 IU/mL Penicillin, 100 μg/mL Streptomycin, 4 μg/mL Human
Recombinant Insulin, 2 mM GlutaMAXTM, and 15 mM HEPES pH 7.4. KC were
resuspended in Advanced DMEM medium supplemented with Thawing/Plating
Supplement Pack (Invitrogen) without Dexamethasone. KC were centrifuged at
500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in complete Advanced DMEM medium. Cell
viability was determined using trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and was
>90% in all cases.
Reagents. IFNα was purchased from Invitrogen; TAF, C646, and GS-9620 were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). Antibodies against HBsAg
(ab20930, 1:100) were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and HBcAg (B0586, 1:200)
were from Dako (Cambridgeshire, UK). Antibodies against CD81 (TAPA-1, JS-81)
were from BD Biosciences (555675, 1:200) and antibodies recognizing connexin 32
(ab66613), ITGB1 (ab30394), and ZO-1 (ab59720) were from Abcam (all 1:100).
The antibody recognizing human albumin was from Fitzgerald (10-1950, 1:200,
Acton, MA, USA). Alexa Fluor488®-, Alexa 594®- and Alexa700®-conjugated
secondary antibodies (A-11034, R37117, A-21038) were from Life Technologies (all
1:2000). LPS was obtained from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). The myristoylated
preS1 peptide (aa2–48) was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Heparinase III
was obtained from Sigma Aldrich.
Microfluidic 3D culture system. Cells were seeded into isolated bioreactors within
the LiverChip platform (CNBio Innovations, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire,
UK) with media flow in the downward direction on top of collagen-coated scaffolds
for 8 h at a flow rate of 1.0 µL/s. Following cell attachment within the scaffold, the
flow was changed to the upward direction and maintained at 1.0 µL/s for the
remainder of the culture. Hepatocyte monocultures were seeded at a density of
0.6 × 106 viable cells in 1.6 mL of medium per well. The cells were maintained in
WEM supplemented with Thawing/Plating Supplement Pack (Invitrogen) for the
first 24 h of culture and in WEM supplemented with Cell Maintenance Supplement
Pack (Invitrogen) thereafter for the duration of the culture. The media was replaced
every 48 h. PHH/KC co-cultures were seeded simultaneously, at a ratio of 10:1. Co-
cultures were seeded in Advance DMEM supplemented with Thawing/Plating
Supplement Pack without dexamethasone (Invitrogen) for the first 72 h of culture
and then in WEM supplemented with Cell Maintenance Supplement Pack without
dexamethasone and with 100 nM hydrocortisone (Invitrogen). The media was
replaced every 48 h.
2D static hepatocyte cultures. PHH were seeded in collagen-coated 12-well
plates at a density of 600,000 cells/well in WEM supplemented with Thawing/
Plating Supplement Pack (Invitrogen). After 24 h, medium was replaced with
WEM supplemented with Cell Maintenance Supplement Pack (Invitrogen) and
total medium was replaced every 48 h.
3D hepatocyte spheroid cultures. 3D spheroid cultures were performed as pre-
viously described18. Cells were seeded into 96-well ultra-low attachment plates
(Corning, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at a density of 1500 cells/well and were
maintained in WEM supplemented with Thawing/Plating Supplement Pack
(Invitrogen) for 5 days prior to HBV infection until the spheroid formation is
readily detectable by microscopy. Medium was subsequently replaced with WEM
supplemented with Cell Maintenance Supplement Pack (Invitrogen) and 50% of
the media volume was replaced every 48 h.
Self-assembling co-cultures of PHH. PHH were seeded at a density of 30,000
cells/well in collagen-coated 96-well plates (Corning) in WEM supplemented with
Thawing/Plating Supplement Pack (Invitrogen). After 24 h, 15,000 NIH3T3/J2 cells
in WEM supplemented with Cell Maintenance Supplement Pack (Invitrogen) were
added and the medium was changed every 48 h for 10 days before infection with
HBV. DMSO 0.5% was added to the cultures 24 h before HBV infection as pre-
viously described19.
HBV production and purification. Infectious recombinant HBV was produced
from the tetracycline-inducible HepDE19 cells. Cells were seeded at 80% con-
fluence in Millicell HY 5-layer cell culture flasks (Millipore), and from 8 days post
withdrawal of tetracycline to induce the production of HBV, virus-containing
supernatants were harvested every 48 h for 12 days. HBV was precipitated from
supernatants using a total concentration of 6% PEG for 16 h at 4 °C and purified by
sucrose density gradient purification using an SW28 rotor at 140,000 × g for 16 h at
4 °C using a Beckman XPN ultracentrifuge (High Wycombe, UK). The resulting

 virus was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% FBS and
stored at −80 °C.
HBV patient-derived viruses and infections. HBV-positive serum samples of five
different donors were used at the indicated MOI. For the 3D infections, serum
samples were diluted in 1.6 mL of WEM supplemented with Cell Maintenance
Supplement Pack with dexamethasone or hydrocortisone (Invitrogen). HBV
infection was performed 3 days after seeding for 24 h, after which cells were washed
three times with maintenance medium for 3.5 min using 1 µL/s downward flow. 2D
infections were performed using PHH seeded in 24-well collagen-treated plates.
Infections were carried out for 24 h, after which cells were washed three times and
the medium was replaced with maintenance medium.
Viral inactivation. HBV inactivation was accomplished by either heat inactivation
at 98 °C for 1.5 min, UV inactivation (254 nm, 3 J/cm2), or by incubation with a
final concentration of 4% w/v formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. For-
maldehyde was removed by filtration using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filter units
(Millipore).
Cell viability analysis. CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Kits and
Celltiter Glo Cell Viability Kits were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI,
USA), and the assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Absorbance (490 nm) was measured using a BMG Labtech FluoStar Optima Plate
Reader. Calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 were from Thermo Scientific.
Human albumin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Human serum albumin
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed as previously
described52. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with goat-anti-human-albumin
primary antibody (1:400 at 37 °C for 2 h, A80-129A from Bethyl, TX, US) and
blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma) in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h.
Supernatants from the cultures were diluted and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Mouse
monoclonal anti-human albumin antibody (ab399, Abcam) was used for primary
detection (1:1000 at 37 °C for 2 h) and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) goat anti-
mouse IgG secondary antibody (405306, BioLegend, London, UK) was used for
secondary detection (1:2000 at
37 °C for an hour). TMB ELISA substrate was added to measure peroxidase
activity. The colorimetric reaction was stopped by adding 1 M H2SO4. Absorbance
(450 nm) was measured using a BMG Labtech FluoStar Optima Plate Reader.
HBsAg and HBeAg ELISAs. HBsAg and HBeAg levels in cell culture supernatants
were quantified using CLIA ELISA Kits (Autobio Diagnostic, Zhengzhou, China),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cytokine XL and phospho-kinase arrays. To quantify the expression of cytokines
and chemokines, a Proteome Profiler™ Human XL Cytokine Array Kit, a
membrane-based antibody array for the determination of relative levels of 102
human cytokines and chemokines, was used according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (R&D Systems, Inc., USA). Briefly, cell culture supernatants, harvested
10 days post HBV infection at different conditions, were incubated overnight with
the Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array. The membrane was washed to
remove unbound material followed by incubation with a cocktail of biotinylated
detection antibodies. Streptavidin-HRP and chemiluminescent detection reagents
were then applied to produce a signal at each capture spot corresponding to
evaluate the amount of protein bound. To quantify the phosphorylation profiles of
kinases and their protein substrates, a Proteome Profiler™ Human Phospho-
Kinase Array, a membrane-based antibody array for the parallel determination of
the relative levels of human protein kinase phosphorylation, was used according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems, Inc., USA). Briefly, cell lysates were
diluted and incubated overnight with the Human Phospho-Kinase Array. The
array was washed to remove unbound proteins followed by incubation with a
cocktail of biotinylated detection antibodies. Streptavidin-HRP and chemilumi-
nescent detection reagents were applied to produce a signal at each capture spot
corresponding to evaluate the amount of phosphorylated protein bound.
Luminex analysis. Cytokines identified as differentially regulated using Proteome
Profiler™ Human XL Cytokine Array were validated using Luminex bead arrays of
IL-8, CXCL10, MCP-1, MIP-3α, Serpin E1, IL-6, TNF-α, Osteopontin, DPPIV, and
VEGF according to the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems, Inc., USA). Data
were analyzed using a five-parameter logistic curve fit.
HBV DNA extraction and quantification. DNA from supernatants harvested at
different time points was extracted using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen,
Manchester, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then viral load was
evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) as described53. The primer sequences used
are forward primer: 5ʹ-GTGTCTGCGGCGTTTTATCA-3ʹ and reverse primer: 5ʹ-
GACAAACGGGCAACATACCTT-3ʹ from Life Technologies, and probe: 5ʹFAM-
CCTCTKCATCCTGCTGCTATGCCTCATC-3ʹTAMRA from Life Technologies.
Quantification was normalized to a 1.3×HBV-containing plasmid (pCMV-HBV),
kindly provided by Christoph Seeger (Fox Chase Cancer Center, PA, USA).
HBV cccDNA extraction and quantification. The quantification of cccDNA was
performed as described previously54. Briefly, total DNA was isolated from scaffolds
using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen), subjected to Plasmid-Safe™ ATP-
Dependent DNase digest (EpiCentre, Madison, WI, USA), and amplified using
qPCR primers specific to the single-stranded HBV genomic region. The primer
sequences used are forward primer: 5ʹ-ATCTGCCGGACCGTGTGC-3ʹ and reverse
primer: 5ʹ-TTGGAGGCTTGAACAGTAGGA-3ʹ from Life Technologies, and
probe: 5ʹFAM-GCACGTCGCATGGAGA-3ʹTAMRA from Life Technologies.
Quantification was normalized to a plasmid containing the complete 951–1621 bp
region unique to cccDNA of 3.2 kb size, generated through Life Technologies.
Viral and cellular RNA extraction and quantification. RNA from cells at dif-
ferent time points and conditions was extracted to determine gene expression or
replicative intermediate production of HBV using the QIAshredder and RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was synthe-
sized using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit provided by Applied
Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described by the manufacturer’s protocol.
qPCR quantification of ISGs, entry factors, PRRs, pgRNA, and sgRNA were per-
formed using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG w/ROX provided by
Life Technologies on a ViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR System instrument (Applied
Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s protocol (Supplementary Table 3). Gene
expression levels for NTCP, ASGPR, CYP2A6, HNMT, ABCB11, CYP2A13,
GSTP1, and SLC22A1 were determined using Taqman Real-Time PCR assays (Life
Technologies). The level of expression in each case was normalized to the
housekeeping gene RPS11 or GAPDH.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. All brightfield and immunofluorescence
microscopy was performed using an EVOS FL Auto microscope (Life
Technologies).
Metabolite quantification by mass spectrometry. Conversion of Tacrine (5 µM)
to 1-hydroxytacrine, Diclofenac (90 µM) to 4-hydroxydiclodenac, and Midazolam
(5 µM) to 1-hydroxymidazolam was used to quantify the activities of CYP-1A2,
CYP-2C9, and CYP3A4, respectively. A single cocktail of substrates was prepared
at a 1000-fold concentration in DMSO and added to medium immediately before
incubation. Microtissues were exposed to drugs by performing a wash followed by
full medium change and incubated for 1 h under standard LiverChip culture
conditions. Metabolites were quantified by mass spectrometry against quantitative
standard curves by an independent contract research organization (Xenogesis Ltd,
Nottingham UK). For N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP) metabolite quantification,
APAP was dissolved directly in cell culture medium to a final concentration of 1
mM. APAP metabolites formed after 6 or 24 h incubation were quantified in media
samples using a quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (AB Sciex 4000
QTrap) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system. Ten microliters of each
sample was separated with a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6u C18 100 A 100 × 2.10 mm
column. A gradient consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water (mobile phase A) and
acetonitrile (mobile phase B) was used with a flow rate of 300 μL/min. The column
oven and auto-sampler were maintained at 40 and 4 °C, respectively. The mass
spectrometer was operated using the multiple reaction-monitoring mode, and the
analytes were detected and quantified using the most abundant transitions obtained
during direct infusion of standards.
CYP450 activity. CYP3A activity of 3D PHH cultures was determined using the
P450-GloTM Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Electron microscopy. For transmission electron microscopic analysis, scaffolds
were fixed overnight at 4 °C with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.3) and post-fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.3) for 1 h at 4 °C. Scaffolds were then dehydrated through a graded
ethanol series before infiltration with TAAB epoxy resin. Resin blocks were poly-
merized at 70 °C for 24 h. In some cases after resin infiltration, cells growing within
the scaffold channels will become loose within the channel while keeping the 3D
growth orientation and therefore could be embedded directly on the resin block. In
other cases, the whole scaffold was embedded flat in the mold and then a razor
blade was used to carefully trim around the scaffolding. Ultrathin sections (70–90
nm) were prepared using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome, mounted on
150 mesh copper grids and contrasted using uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
Samples were examined on an FEI Tecnai 12 transmission microscope operated at
120 kV. Images were acquired with an AMT 16000M camera.
Statistical analysis. Sample sizes were calculated based on an average expected
effect size of 70% using alpha and beta levels of 0.05 and 0.5, respectively. Statistical
significance was tested using two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test
in Prism v5.0 (GraphPad). A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.
