Abstract
Background: Strategies in many countries have sought to improve palliative care and reduce hospital deaths for
non-cancer patients, but their effects are not evaluated. We aimed to determine the trends and factors associated
with dying in hospital in two common progressive respiratory diseases, and the impact of a national end of life
care (EoLC) strategy to reduce deaths in hospital.
Methods: This population-based observational study linked death registration data for people in England dying
from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial pulmonary diseases (IPD). We plotted age- and
sex-standardised trends, assessed during the pre-strategy (2001–2004), first strategy phase (2004–2008), and strategy
intensification (2009–2014) periods, and identified factors associated with hospital death using multiple adjusted
proportion ratios (PRs).
Results: Over 14 years, 380,232 people died from COPD (334,520) or IPD (45,712). Deaths from COPD and IPD
increased by 0.9% and 9.2% annually, respectively. Death in hospital was most common (67% COPD, 70% IPD).
Dying in hospice was rare (0.9% COPD, 2.9% IPD). After a plateau in 2004–2005, hospital deaths fell (PRs 0.92–0.94).
Co-morbidities and deprivation independently increased the chances of dying in hospital, with larger effects in IPD
(PRs 1.01–1.55) than COPD (PRs 1.01–1.39) and dose-response gradients. The impact of multimorbidity increased
over time; hospital deaths did not fall for people with two or more co-morbidities in COPD, nor one or more in IPD.
Living in rural areas (PRs 0.94–0.94) or outside London (PRs, 0.89–0.98) reduced the chances of hospital death. In
IPD, increased age reduced the likelihood of hospital death (PR 0.81, ≥ 85 versus ≤ 54 years); divergently, in COPD,
being aged 65–74 years was associated with increased hospital deaths (PR 1.13, versus ≤ 54 years). The independent
effects of sex and marital status differed for COPD versus IPD (PRs 0.89–1.04); in COPD, hospital death was
associated with being married.
Conclusions: The EoLC strategy appeared to have contributed to tangible reductions in hospital deaths, but did
not reach people with multimorbidity and this gap widened over time. Integrating palliative care earlier in the
disease trajectory especially in deprived areas and cities, and where multimorbidity is present, should be boosted,
taking into account the different demographic factors in COPD and IPD.

 Background
Chronic diseases and multimorbidity are common and
increasing. Respiratory diseases are major contributors,
especially
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(COPD) and interstitial pulmonary disease (IPD). More
than 3 million people worldwide died of COPD in 2012,
representing 6% of all deaths that year [1]. Mortality
from IPDs is climbing, with current age-standardized
mortality ranging from 4 to 10 per 100,000 population
(highest in UK and lowest in Sweden) [2]. Both condi-
tions result in a high use of hospital services across all
medical areas, especially among people in advanced
stages, when the systemic effects of disease lead to de-
pendency [3]; this leads to high healthcare costs. UK
population-based data on admissions suggests that, in
IPD, the estimated financial burden of hospitalisation in
2010 was £16.2 million per year [4]. Despite this expend-
iture, there are concerns that care in advanced disease is
suboptimal, inadequately co-ordinated, and with patients
suffering an average of 14 symptoms, plus psychological
and information concerns [5–8]. For most patients with
a progressive illness, the hospital is among the least pre-
ferred places of death [9].
In the UK, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence
(NICE) published Guidance on Supportive and Palliative
Care in 2004 [10], and an extra £50 million was allocated
to palliative care services. Building from this Guidance,
the End of Life Care (EoLC) Programme was developed
to improve care in the last year of life, with a specific
goal to reach patients in general medical care and with
diseases beyond cancer [11]. Roll out was intensified
after
2008
within
the
EoLC
Strategy
[12].
The
Programme and Strategy prioritised home care as an
alternative to hospital, promoting initiatives to elicit
preferred place of death and boost support from gen-
eral practitioners. However, whether policies altered
care for those dying from major diseases, apart from
cancer [11, 13], is unknown. Where people die is a
common quality marker. Whilst place of death has
been widely studied internationally in cancer [13–15],
only one Spanish study has assessed factors associated
with place of death from COPD [16], and none for
IPD, despite the greater prevalence of respiratory conditions
and the imminent global epidemic [3]. Understanding which
factors affect place of death is vital for service planning and
care improvement, especially given population ageing, rising
chronic diseases worldwide and the high costs of hospital
admissions [17]. Information to reduce hospitalisations is
needed internationally both to meet patient preferences and
to ease healthcare costs [18–21].
Therefore, we aimed to compare the trends and factors
associated with place of death in people with two
common progressive respiratory diseases. We sought to
determine whether hospital deaths for individuals dying
from COPD or IPD fell after the Strategy was intro-
duced, and after roll out was intensified. To aid future
interventions, we also evaluated which factors affected
place of death, and whether these were similar across
COPD and IPD.
Methods
Study design
Population-based observational study (as per STROBE
and RECORD [22] guidelines, Additional file 1) as part
of our study of Geographical and Temporal Variations in
Place of Death in England (GUIDE_Care) [23].
Data sources
The Office for National Statistics death registrations in
England, which detail decedents’ age, sex, marital status,
usual residence, place and year of death, and, based on
the clinician’s death certificate, the underlying and
contributing causes of death using the International
Classification
of
Diseases Tenth
Revision
(ICD-10),
employed since 2001.
Office for National Statistics death registration records
were
linked
with
area
level
indices
of
multiple
deprivation (IMD) 2010 [24]. The IMD 2010 is a com-
posite measure of deprivation, providing a weighted
average of seven domains: income, employment, health
and disability, education, skills and training, living envir-
onment and crime, and barriers to housing and services.
These are based on the Lower Super Output Area
(LSOA) of the decedents’ usual residence. There are
32,482 LSOAs in England, with each area having a mini-
mum of 1000 residents and an average of 1500. LSOAs
were grouped into quintiles based on their IMD scores
[13, 24, 25].
Study population
All deaths between 2001 and 2014 (inclusive) with
COPD or IPD as an underlying cause of death (ICD-10
codes: J40-J44, J47 (COPD); J84 (Interstitial pulmonary
disease, encompassing all progressive fibrotic interstitial
lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia)) were extracted.
Variables
The main outcome was place of death grouped into six
categories: hospital, home, hospice (an inpatient special-
ist palliative care unit, freestanding or clearly specified
within a hospital, 75% are voluntary, 25% NHS man-
aged), nursing home, care home or residential home,
and elsewhere [13].
Explanatory variables were age at death (≤54, 55–64,
65–74, 75–84, 85+), sex (men, women), year of death
(grouped
into
2001–2004
(pre-Strategy),
2005–2008
(Strategy first phase, which included the implementation
Higginson et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:19 
Page 2 of 12
 of the NICE Guidance and first phase of the EoLC
Programme and Strategy), and 2009–2014 (Strategy in-
tensification)), marital status (married, widowed, divorced,
single, not stated/unknown), number of co-morbidities
assessed from contributory cause(s) of death (0, 1, 2, 3, 4
+), type of settlement (rural, urban), socioeconomic status
(as measured by IMD of area of residence), and region
(defined by Clinical Senate, 2013). We analysed age as an
ordered five-category rather than a continuous variable to
aid interpretation and comparison with other studies;
category boundaries were chosen based on the data
distribution [26–28].
Statistical analysis
We plotted the time trend of age- and sex-standardised
proportion of deaths in hospital for COPD and IPD.
Proportions were standardised using the 2010–2015
mortality structure for more developed countries from
the United Nations standard population [29].
We used Modified Poisson Regression to evaluate the
relationship between place of death and potential ex-
planatory variables (selected from those available, ac-
cording to existing literature and univariable analysis
results), including age, sex, marital status, co-morbidity,
year of death, IMD, rural/urban indicator and region of
the usual residential address (Table 2). The dependent
variable was binary (1 = hospital, 0 = non-hospital). We
focused on hospital death as this was most common and
reducing it was a target of the Strategy. The strength of
association was measured using proportion ratios (PRs).
Two separate models were constructed for COPD and
IPD. The Modified Poisson regression was chosen over
the binomial model as the latter failed to converge in
IPD [30]. Sensitivity analysis entered year of death as a
continuous rather than categorical variable.
All analyses were performed using the SAS 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Over the 14 years, 334,520 people died from COPD and
45,712 from IPD (Table 1), representing 5.3% and 0.7%
of the total 6,368,760 non-accidental deaths during the
period. Annual deaths from COPD increased slightly
from 23,303 (2001–2004) to 24,717 (2009–2014), repre-
senting a yearly increase of 0.9%. The annual number of
IPD deaths, although much smaller, almost doubled
from 2403 (2001–2004) to 4091 (2009–2014); represent-
ing a yearly increase of 9.2%. Across both conditions,
more than 65% of deaths occurred among people aged
over 75 years.
Hospital was the most common place of death (67.3%
for COPD, 70.1% IPD), followed by home (19.9% COPD,
19.1% IPD). Deaths within hospices accounted for just
0.9% of COPD and 2.9% of IPD cases (Table 1).
The pattern of higher proportions of hospital deaths in
IPD was consistent over the years, even when standar-
dised by age and sex. For both groups, the proportion of
hospital deaths peaked between 2003 and 2005 (Fig. 1).
The proportion of age- and sex-standardised deaths in
hospital fell slightly between 2005 and 2014 for people
with COPD (from 67% to 61%) and IPD (from 71 to 68%).
In multivariable analysis (Table 2), hospital deaths re-
duced significantly over time in both COPD and IPD,
with a fall occurring after 2005. Female sex was inde-
pendently associated with higher hospital deaths in
COPD (PR 1.04) but lower in IPD (PR 0.97). In COPD,
there was a U-shaped relationship regarding age, with
those aged 65–74 years having the highest hospital
deaths (PR 1.12); whereas in IPD, increased age was in-
dependently associated with fewer hospital deaths (PR
0.81). Being married increased the chance of dying in
hospital for COPD but not for IPD (Table 2).
Having co-morbidities and living in deprived areas in-
dependently increased the chance of dying in hospital,
with larger effects for IPD (PRs 1.01–1.55) than COPD
(PRs 1.01–1.39) and a “dose–response” relationship
(Fig. 2). Living in rural areas as opposed to cities reduced
the chances of hospital death (PRs 0.94–0.95). When plot-
ted over the period (Fig. 2), after 2005 hospital deaths fell
chiefly for people with no co-morbidities. Hospital deaths
did not fall for people with two or more co-morbidities in
COPD, or with any co-morbidity in IPD. For deprivation
and urban areas, the dose–response relationship appeared
to stay constant over time (Fig. 2).
Significant variations by region were observed for both
COPD and IPD. For COPD and IPD groups, “London”
had the highest hospital deaths, and the “South West”
and “South East Coast” regions had lower hospital
deaths than most other regions. Sensitivity analysis, with
year of death as a continuous variable, produced similar
results (Table 3).
Discussion
In this large population-based study assessing place of
death in respiratory disease over 14 years, we found
hospital was the most common place of death, and
remained
constantly
higher
for
people
with
IPD
(67.5–74.7%, standardised by age and sex) than COPD
(61.3–67.4%). During the period following the intro-
duction of the NICE Guidance on Supportive and
Palliative Care, and the introduction and intensifica-
tion of the EoLC Strategy, hospital deaths fell slightly,
by 6% for people with COPD and 3% for IPD. In re-
gression analysis, the change after 2005 was signifi-
cant for both COPD and IPD.
Our design is observational; therefore, as in other
population studies, we cannot infer causality. However,

 our findings meet many of the Bradford-Hill and related
criteria [31] for providing evidence supporting a causal
relationship. There is strength, consistency, specificity
and coherence in our findings. We observed a similar
but more pronounced and immediate effect in adults
who died from cancer – the traditionally best served
condition by palliative and end of life care [13]. Con-
versely, in children and young people with cancer, a pa-
tient population rarely accessing palliative and end of
life care services, the Strategy made little impact on
where people die [32]. There is strong evidence of tem-
porality, with the changes emerging after the Strategy
was introduced and increased after it was intensified.
For both conditions, multimorbidity, social deprivation
and living in urban areas were associated with dying in
hospital, with larger effects for IPD than COPD. We
found a “dose–response” effect, with higher deprivation
and multimorbidity producing the largest effects on
dying in hospital. Increased age and being female were
associated with higher hospital deaths in COPD but lower
in IPD. In both groups, being single, widowed or divorced,
and living in rural or outside London areas were
associated with reduced chances of dying in hospital.
These data are ecological, and may be subject to the eco-
logical fallacy, whereby the risk-associations apparent for
social deprivation, multimorbidity, or other factors may
not accurately reflect the true association between individ-
uals within those groups. However, our findings meet the
Bradford-Hill criteria of a dose–response relationship.
These associations could be examined further in prospect-
ive research.
Our findings suggest the EoLC Strategy contributed to
tangible impact in reducing hospital deaths for people
with respiratory diseases. However, the effects were
mainly for people with few or no co-morbidities; people
with two or more co-morbidities had no reduction in
hospital deaths over the period. Most healthcare systems
are dominantly established for people with individual
diseases [33, 34]. Many different specialists can become
involved during multimorbidity. This can be duplicative,
burdensome and unsafe for patients because of poor co-
ordination and integration, with some patients inversely
receiving less care [33, 35, 36]. Another reason might be
that the more medical specialists are involved, the higher

 the chance of the family doctor or general practitioner
(GP) having a minor role in the care of the patient, thus
being less often aware of the progressive stage of the dis-
eases. Supporting patients with multimorbidity needs
knowledge and expertise that a GP may not always have,
which may be a reason for why GPs may refer to
hospital during crises. These factors could increase hos-
pital admissions and length of stay.
Multimorbidity is increasing globally [37, 38]. In the
UK, the number of people with three or more long-term
conditions is predicted to rise from 1.9 million in 2008
to 2.9 million in 2018, requiring a major increase in

 healthcare expenditure [39]. It was particularly concern-
ing that, in our data, there was no fall in hospital deaths
for people with multimorbidity, and the disparity wid-
ened over time. Therefore, it is essential that future
strategies for end of life and palliative care directly ad-
dress the issue of multimorbidity, and this may require
different approaches.
Median survival for people with IPD is poor, at be-
tween 2 and 5 years from diagnosis [40]. Prognosis in
COPD is better, though around one third die within
3 years following diagnosis [41]. However, it is difficult
to prognosticate, as many people have frequent exacer-
bations of their disease and encounter life-threatening
events before death occurs. Prognostication, especially

 during the last year of life, is problematic when patients
have multimorbidity. Patients with COPD and IPD often
suffer refractory breathlessness, which can result in panic
and distress [42]. Breathlessness is often unpredictable
and episodic [5, 43], with multiple other symptoms that
can result in accident and emergency attendance [44].
Managing refractory breathlessness and issues in multi-
morbidity is therefore more complex and time consuming
than for single conditions, especially responding to the
needs for ‘joined-up’ co-ordination, communication and
symptom management [35, 36]. Organising some specific
treatments, such as non-invasive ventilation in COPD,
also may take time in the community.
Taken together, these findings suggest that earlier pal-
liative care is needed, with an integrated short-term as-
sessment and review. Two challenges exist regarding
access to end of life or palliative care for a patient with
organ failure. Firstly, when and how to trigger care? As
prognostication is difficult, professionals can have ‘prog-
nostic paralysis’
, and may postpone discussions with pa-
tients about the future. Secondly, patients may not
realise or acknowledge that they have a life-limiting dis-
ease. This is often not clearly communicated by the
healthcare professionals, which implies that preferred
place of death is not discussed [45]. Early palliative care
could be triggered by multimorbidity and complexity in
terms of symptoms and needs rather than waiting until
the end of life is apparent or acknowledged. Evidence
supports such services; strong evidence supports early
integration in cancer [46, 47] and evidence is emerging
in respiratory and mixed conditions for integrated
breathlessness support services [48, 49], hospital to
home [50] and multiprofessional teams [51]. Perhaps
multimorbidity should be a specific focus for palliative
care. A recent study found the cost-savings of palliative
care were largest among patients with multimorbidity,
costs were 22% lower than standard care for patients
with a co-morbidity score of 2–3 and with 32% lower for
those with a score of 4 or higher [52]. There may be a
role for tools to understand and elicit discussions earlier
in care, including in Intensive Care Units [53, 54], and
for palliative care units in the acute hospital where non-
invasive
ventilation
can
be
provided.
Exactly
how
integration should occur needs to be tailored to the
characteristics of the healthcare system and the local re-
sources but evidence suggests that identification based
on clinical characteristics is more reliable than relying
on clinicians to remember to make referrals [46]. The
factors identified in this study, along with the symptom
of breathlessness, could be applied to trigger more inte-
grated palliative support, with models such as a breath-
lessness support service [49]. Hospices, which in the UK
provide inpatient specialist palliative care, remained a
rare place of death, yet these may be appropriate places
outside of hospitals to care for more complex patients
with multimorbidity.
Our
findings
support
other
research
that
found
deprivation is associated with higher hospital and fewer
home deaths in cancer and COPD [15, 55, 56], and studies
in COPD suggesting that deprivation and co-morbidity
are associated with hospital admission and readmission
for acute exacerbation [17, 57, 58]. We could find no lit-
erature on deprivation in IPD; ours appears to be the first
study to consider this group. It would seem plausible that
more hospital admissions may lead to greater chances of
dying in hospital. McAllister et al.’s [55] study in Scotland
found that winter and socioeconomic deprivation-related
factors appear to act synergistically, increasing the rate of
COPD admissions to hospital more among deprived
people and in winter. The results suggest there may be a
role for targeting initiatives in deprived areas and in win-
ter. Interestingly, we found both diseases were still in-
creasing in frequency as a cause of death over the period
and for COPD this appears to run contrary to other
European trends [59].
Factors such as being widowed or divorced making
hospital deaths less likely in COPD are surprising; this is
independent of age and may suggest the presence of
family members increased the chance of patients being
admitted to hospitals. Qualitative work has identified
gaps in information and support for patients, families
and professionals, who are often invisible to services
[60]. The findings highlight more work is needed to
support patients and family members at home, who
often struggle in knowing what to do when breath-
lessness escalates [61].
For COPD, our findings of age and sex run contrary to
those of a study of 4983 decedents in Andalusia, Spain
[16], where older age and female sex were associated
with home death. However, the Andalusia study con-
trolled for a smaller number of potential confounders,
e.g. deprivation and co-morbidities were not assessed,
whereas both were important in our study. It also con-
sidered only one year, 2009, and focussed on factors as-
sociated with deaths at home versus elsewhere rather
than with hospital versus elsewhere. In accordance with
our results, the Andalusia study found rural residents
were more likely to die at home.
Our study was limited by the nature of data available.
We do not have information to address the appropriate-
ness of the place of end of life care and the quality of
the care provided. COPD and IPD can be characterised
by a trajectory of a prolonged phase of recurrent exacer-
bations with recovery. Patients and their families are
often acutely distressed during an exacerbation. Standard
medical treatments are often appropriate in correcting
reversible processes, and also in providing symptom re-
lief in these circumstances. Thus, palliative and end of
Higginson et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:19 
Page 9 of 12
 life care strategies may well need to be different for these
patients than for cancer patients. Approximately 70% of
the patients died in hospital, with patients admitted to
hospital rather than remaining at home. Primary care
and hospital teams may have thought that admission
was the best option [61]. Many services have now moved
on from the limitations of applying the generic EoLC
strategy to COPD and IPD patients, to a model of care
whereby standard medical and palliative care are deliv-
ered in parallel, in an integrated way, particularly in dis-
eases where the patient has a good prospect of recovery
from an acute exacerbation.
Other research indicates that people with COPD and
IPD often miss out on the best care in advanced stages
of illness, in the community, in hospital, and from pallia-
tive care [8, 62, 63]. Our finding of high hospital use
may be a result of lower quality care and forward plan-
ning, driving emergency admissions [61, 63, 64]. There
is little research on the preferences for place of care and
death of people with respiratory disease, but there is no
data to indicate that their preferences are especially dif-
ferent from other groups [14]. It is possible that COPD
and IPD were misclassified as a cause of death, but as
we focussed on recent years, this effect is likely to be
minimised. The increase in mortality from IPD has been
partly linked to better identification of the disease [2, 4].
The apparent growth in IPD in our study may also be as
a result of this trend. It is also possible that classification
of IPD and COPD as a cause of death is influenced by
setting, and other conditions, such as pneumonia, are
more commonly recorded in community settings, thus
underestimating COPD and IPD deaths in these settings.
However, these limitations would be unlikely to affect
the trends over time or the associated factors. The only
concern would be if the Strategy helped to identify
people with COPD and IPD earlier, which lead to in-
creased community identification and recording as a
cause of death. If this occurred, the effect of the Strategy
found here would be over-estimated. Multimorbidity is
usually defined as the presence of two or more chronic
diseases within an individual. We used the reported con-
tributing causes of death to determine the number of
co-morbidities. It may have been that only more major
co-morbidities were recorded and therefore the number
of co-morbidities may be underestimated. However, the
presence of the clear trend shows the need to focus
more clearly in the future on multimorbidity and its po-
tential role. Our factors and trends point the way to po-
tential interventions to improve care.
Conclusions
Hospital deaths from COPD and IPD fell by 3–6% in the
8 years following the introduction of the EoLC strategy;
however, those with multimorbidity did not show a fall
in hospital deaths. Multimorbidity, deprivation, living in
cities, and living in London play a greater role in affect-
ing where people with IPD die than those with COPD.
Age and sex affect the chance of hospital death differ-
ently for COPD and IPD. Being married rather than sin-
gle, widowed or divorced made hospital death more
likely in COPD, but not in IPD. Thus, the results suggest
that the EoLC Strategy may have helped to shift some
deaths out of hospital for people with respiratory disease
but more integrated approaches of earlier palliative care
are needed, targeting those at highest risk, especially
with multimorbidity, and in deprived areas and cities.
Further initiatives and trials are needed to understand
and to improve the quality of care for people both in
hospital (where most people are dying) and at home.
