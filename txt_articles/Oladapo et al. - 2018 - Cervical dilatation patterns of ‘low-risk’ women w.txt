Background The call for women-centred approaches to reduce
labour interventions, particularly primary caesarean section, has
renewed an interest in gaining a better understanding of natural
labour progression.
Objective To synthesise available data on the cervical dilatation
patterns during spontaneous labour of ‘low-risk’ women with
normal perinatal outcomes.
Search strategy PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, POPLINE, Global
Health Library, and reference lists of eligible studies.
Selection criteria Observational studies and other study designs.
Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data on:
maternal characteristics; labour interventions; the duration of
labour centimetre by centimetre; and the duration of labour from
dilatation at admission through to 10 cm. We pooled data across
studies using weighted medians and employed the Bootstrap-t
method to generate the corresponding confidence bounds.
Main results Seven observational studies describing labour
patterns for 99 971 women met our inclusion criteria. The
median time to advance by 1 cm in nulliparous women was
longer than 1 hour until a dilatation of 5 cm was reached, with
markedly rapid progress after 6 cm. Similar labour progression
patterns were observed in parous women. The 95th percentiles
for both parity groups suggest that it was not uncommon for
some women to reach 10 cm, despite dilatation rates that were
much slower than the 1-cm/hour threshold for most part of
their first stage of labours.
Conclusion An expectation of a minimum cervical dilatation
threshold of 1 cm/hour throughout the first stage of labour is
unrealistic for most healthy nulliparous and parous women. Our
findings call into question the universal application of clinical
standards that are conceptually based on an expectation of linear
labour progress in all women.

Introduction
The landmark studies of Emmanuel Friedman in the 1950s
and 1960s on normal and abnormal labour progression
have continued to influence labour management until
today.1–5 Since the early 2000s, however, there is increasing
evidence to suggest that the described relationship between
cervical dilatation and duration of the first stage of labour,

Systematic review
 and the definitions of labour protraction and arrest that
have informed obstetric practice for over six decades, may
be inappropriate.6,7 In practice, identifying abnormally pro-
gressing labour that justifies a medical intervention is often
challenging. Thus, ‘failure of labour to progress’—a poorly
defined but generally accepted term—has become a leading
indication for oxytocin augmentation and primary cae-
sarean section (CS). The need to medically expedite birth
on the grounds of slow labour accounts for the rapid esca-
lation in global rates of labour augmentation and CS in the
last two decades.8 This interventionist approach, including
the ‘active management of labour’ model of care, is likely
to interfere with a woman’s intrinsic capacity to give birth
and to negatively impact on her birth experience and
health outcomes.9
The call for women-centred approaches to reduce labour
and childbirth interventions, particularly primary CS, has
renewed interest in a better understanding of natural
labour progression.10,11 This has become more critical
because of the variations in current labour practices and
the characteristics of pregnant women compared with when
Friedman conducted his studies.12 An important derivative
of Friedman’s work—the ‘1-cm/hour’ alert line of the par-
tograph—has come under intense scrutiny as a result of
studies suggesting that labour can indeed be slower than
the limits earlier proposed.6,7,13 Studies published in the
last decade on ‘natural’ labour progression have prompted
a few international organisations to revise their labour
management guidelines to accommodate a cervical dilata-
tion rate slower than 1 cm/hour as the normal thresh-
old.11,14 In spite of these developments, several obstetric
textbooks and international guidelines still maintain 1 cm/
hour as the minimum dilatation threshold that should be
expected in all women.15,16 This lack of international con-
sensus calls for a systematic evaluation of the available
studies on this topic to justify a review of global guidance
on assessment of labour progression. The aim of this
review was to synthesise available data on cervical dilata-
tion patterns during the spontaneous labour of ‘low-risk’
women with normal perinatal outcomes.
Methods
We conducted this review in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines, and followed a protocol (PROS-
PERO2016:CRD42016053892).17 Eligible studies included
published and unpublished observational studies reporting
cervical dilatation over time for low-risk women with spon-
taneous labour and normal perinatal outcomes. We consid-
ered but did not identify randomised and non-randomised
trials in which observations of cervical dilatation patterns
were reported for our population of interest. We included
studies where the study population was defined as women
‘without risk factors for complications’ or women who
were deemed to be ‘low-risk’, or with clearly defined
criteria including at the minimum a singleton pregnancy,
near-term or term pregnancy, and cephalic (or vertex) pre-
sentation, and a labour progression that ended in a vaginal
birth or reached full cervical dilatation. ‘Normal perinatal
outcomes’ were as defined by the primary study authors,
but must include birth of a live baby with an Apgar score
of ≥7 at 5 minutes. We excluded studies that estimated the
linear cervical dilatation rate from the total duration of
labour without describing the labour progression patterns
throughout the first stage, and those that applied an ‘active
management of labour’ protocol in the management of all
study participants.
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, POPLINE,
Global Health Library, and the reference lists of eligible
studies, and contacted authors for any further published
and unpublished work. No date or language restrictions
were applied. The detailed search strategies are included in
Appendix S1. Two review authors independently performed
initial screening of search outputs, identified eligible stud-
ies, and extracted the data. A third author verified eligible
studies and checked data for errors. Any discrepancies were
resolved through discussion.
Outcomes of interest consisted of baseline information
(including demographic and reproductive characteristics
and labour admission findings) and interventions during
labour.
To
determine
cervical
dilatation
patterns,
we
extracted data on the time (in hours) needed to gain
1 cm as labour progresses through to 10 cm (i.e. the
‘traverse time’ or ‘sojourn time’ from 2 to 3 cm, 3 to
4 cm, etc.) To assess potential differences in labour pat-
terns
based
on
cervical
dilatation
on
admission,
we
extracted data on the cumulative labour duration from
the cervical dilatation on admission (i.e. at 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6 cm) at an interval of 1 cm until 10 cm. All time-
related variables were extracted using the reported mea-
sure of central tendency (median or mean) and their
corresponding distribution. Data were extracted according
to two parity groups: nulliparous (parity = 0) and parous
(parity ≥ 1) women.
We synthesised data on cervical dilatation patterns to
generate aggregate estimates of time to gain 1 cm from one
level of cervical dilatation to the other (i.e. centimetre by
centimetre), and time to advance by 1 cm from cervical
dilatation at admission, until 10 cm. For studies reporting
medians, we determined the weighted median of time (in
hours) to pool data across studies. The weighted approach,
based on the number of women providing the data from
each study, took into consideration the individual study
size. To derive confidence bounds for pooled medians for
the centimetre by centimetre labour duration, we combined

Labour progression patterns of low-risk women
 samples generated with quantiles and sample sizes assum-
ing uniform probability, and used a two-level Bootstrap-t
method to estimate standard errors and percentiles of the
Student’s t-statistic to compute confidence intervals.18 We
used SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R-
CRAN 3.4.0 for these analyses.19
We designed a checklist and criteria to assess the
methodological quality of the included studies to investi-
gate their internal and external validity based on the fol-
lowing attributes: primary intent of the research question
(evaluation of labour progression clearly described as pri-
mary study objective versus secondary analysis); represen-
tativeness of the study population (truly representative of
low-risk women, with a detailed description of normal
perinatal
outcomes,
versus
unclear
representativeness
because of a lack of details on the excluded risk factors
and/or
inadequate
description
of
perinatal
outcomes);
ascertainment
and
temporality
of
the
observations
(prospective
direct
observations
versus
retrospective
review of medical charts); adequacy of data points for
valid assessment of cervical dilatation patterns for study
participants (restriction of analysis to women with at
least three versus two or fewer/unreported data points);
and the use of a valid and robust approach for analysing
labour progression and constructing the labour curve
(advanced statistical and/or computational method versus
graphical or other methods). The studies were assessed to
be at low, moderate, or high risk of bias based on com-
pliance with more than three, three, and fewer than three
of the above criteria, respectively.
Results
We prepared the results according to the proposed report-
ing checklist for meta-analysis of observational studies.20
Of the 8785 citations obtained from the search strategies,
169 potentially eligible studies were identified for full-text
assessment (Figure 1). Seven observational studies con-
ducted in the USA,6,7,21 China,22,23 Japan,24 Nigeria (OT
Oladapo et al., unpubl. data), and Uganda (OT Oladapo
et al., unpubl. data) met our inclusion criteria.
Tables
S1
and
S2
show
the
characteristics
of
the
included studies and corresponding study populations.
Study populations were generally made up of the nation-
ality where each study was conducted, except for studies
in the USA.6,7,21 All of the studies provided data for
nulliparous women (n = 43 148), whereas three studies
provided
data
for
parous
women
(n = 56 823)
(OT
Oladapo et al., unpubl. data).6,21 Nulliparous women had
mean ages of 20.3–28.0 years and gestational ages at
delivery of 39.3–39.8 weeks. Parous women had mean
ages of 22.7–30.9 years and gestational ages at delivery of
39.1–39.8 weeks.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of women at
labour admission, and the interventions received during
labour. For nulliparous women the median cervical dilata-
tion was 3.0–4.0 cm, with variable degrees of effacement,
and for parous women the median cervical dilatation was
3.5–5.0 cm, with a considerable proportion of women with
a well-effaced cervix. Oxytocin augmentation varied from
0% (in a Chinese study)23 to 50% in a US study,7 for nulli-
parous women, and between 126 and 45%21 in two US
study populations for parous women. Epidural analgesia
use was restricted to the US studies for both parity
groups.6,7,21
Tables S3 and S4, and Figure S1, present the risk of
bias for the included studies. Of the seven studies examin-
ing nulliparous women, four were considered to be at low
risk of bias (OT Oladapo et al., unpubl. data),6,21,22 two
at moderate risk of bias,7,24 and one at high risk of bias.23
All three studies examining parous women were assessed
to be at low risk of bias (OT Oladapo et al., unpubl.
data).6,21
Cervical dilatation patterns
Time to advance by 1 cm during the first stage of labour in
nulliparous women
Table 2 shows the time required to advance from one
level of cervical dilatation to the next. From six studies,
the pooled median time to advance by 1 cm in nulli-
parous women was longer than 1 hour until a dilatation
of 5 cm was reached (i.e. when the median dilatation
rate became 1.09 cm/hour) (OT Oladapo et al., unpubl.
data).6,7,21,22,24 The transition
to more rapid
progress
started between 5 and 6 cm, but it was only after 6 cm
that the dilatation rate doubled (Figure S2). The 95th per-
centiles of the time reported by individual studies suggest
that it was not uncommon for women to spend more
than 4 hours progressing from 3 to 4 cm, as well as from
4 to 5 cm. As labour progressed, the 95th percentiles
show wide variability around the median for each level of
cervical dilatation in each study; however, there is a con-
siderable overlap in the distributions of women whose
labours were slower than the median for their popula-
tions, but who achieved full dilatation when considered
centimetre by centimetre (Figure S3). The exception is
Suzuki et al.,24 who reported an even slower labour than
all other studies. Based on the lowest values of 95th per-
centile data across studies, there were always women
whose rates of dilatation never reached the 1-cm/hour
threshold except between 9 and 10 cm. The data show
that it was not uncommon for women to achieve full cer-
vical dilatation despite progressing at rates slower than the
1-cm/hour threshold for the most part of their labours.
The only study that reported the mean time to advance
946

Oladapo et al.
 by 1 cm found similar patterns as were found in the stud-
ies reporting medians.23
Time to advance by 1 cm during the first stage of labour in
parous women
Similar to nulliparous women, Table 3 shows that the
pooled median time it took parous women to advance by
1 cm was longer than 1 hour until a cervical dilatation of
5 cm
was
reached
(when
the
median
dilatation
rate
became
1.49 cm/hour);
however,
the
dilatation
rate
increased sharply and almost doubled between 5 and 6 cm,
and then rose rapidly as it advanced towards 10 cm (Fig-
ure S2). As labour progressed, the 95th percentile data
show considerable overlap in the distributions of women
with labours that progressed more slowly than the medians
and yet achieved full dilatation (Figure S4). When advanc-
ing from 4 to 5 cm, some women took between 3.30 and
8.05 hours, and when advancing from 5 to 6 cm, some
women took between 1.60 and 6.24 hours. Based on the
lowest values of 95th percentile data across studies, there
were always women whose rates of dilatation never reached
the 1-cm/hour threshold until 7 cm.
Cumulative labour duration from cervical dilatation at
admission in nulliparous women
Three studies reporting the median cumulative duration of
labour from the dilatation at admission to the next cen-
timetre, until 10 cm was reached,
show the patterns
reflected
in
the
centimetre-by-centimetre
progression
(Table S5) (OT Oladapo et al., unpubl. data).6,21 When
estimated linearly, the total median time from any cervical
dilatation at admission until 10 cm reflects a dilatation rate
of less than 1 cm/hour: 2–10 cm (7.85 hours), 3–10 cm
(6.44 hours), 4–10 cm (4.86 hours), 5–10 cm (3.44 hours),
and 6–10 cm (2.86 hours). The rates became much faster
as the dilatation at admission increased, similar to the
observations in the centimetre-by-centimetre data; however,
the corresponding 95th percentile data show a wide vari-
ability above the median duration. Figure S5 illustrates
these 95th percentiles plotted as connected staircase lines

 for specific dilatation observed at admission. For example,
in nulliparous women admitted with a dilatation of 2 cm,
the pooled median time to reach 4 cm was 2.96 hours, but
the 95th percentiles ranged between 11.20 and 12.60 hours.
Likewise, the pooled median time to achieve a dilatation of
10 cm for women admitted at 4 cm was 4.86 hours, but
the 95th percentiles were between 14.10 and 16.40 hours.
Cumulative labour duration from cervical dilatation at
admission in parous women
One study reported data on the cumulative duration of
labour based on the dilatation at admission for parous
women (Table S6) (OT Oladapo et al., unpubl. data). The
observed patterns are similar to those for nulliparous
women. Figure S6 illustrates the 95th percentile data plot-
ted as connected staircase lines for dilatation at admission.
For example, in women admitted at 3 cm, the pooled
median time to reach 5 cm was 3.49 hours, but the 95th
percentiles ranged between 18.55 and 20.75 hours, and for
women admitted at 4 cm, the pooled median time to reach
10 cm was 3.23 hours, but the 95th percentile ranged from
12.96 to 13.02 hours.
Discussion
Main findings
Our review shows that cervical dilatation patterns for low-
risk women are not linear. The overall labour progression
pattern deviates considerably from the classic Friedman’s
curve that has been central to labour practice for several
decades.1–3 In the early part of the period that is traditionally
described as the active phase, we found that the rate of cervi-
cal dilatation may be slower, and in advanced labour the rate
may indeed be faster than generally thought. Labour tends to
become accelerative (i.e. >1 cm/hour) between 5 and 6 cm
in both nulliparous and parous women. Thereafter, it esca-
lates rapidly as labour becomes more advanced. An impor-
tant finding across included studies is the wide variability in
the distribution of cervical dilatation profiles, as shown by
the 5th and 95th percentiles. Whereas the median cumulative
duration of labour from cervical dilatation at admission
through full dilatation is similar to the observations in earlier
studies,1–3,25,26 the corresponding 95th percentiles across
studies show that it is not uncommon for some women to
experience much longer labour and yet give birth vaginally
without adverse perinatal outcomes. Women admitted
before 4 cm tend to progress very slowly, and could take
close to 24 hours before achieving full cervical dilatation.
Strength and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that
has analysed cervical dilatation patterns centimetre by cen-
timetre for the assessment of labour progression. We
examined the cervical dilatation pattern from one level to
the next, rather than estimate the average dilatation rate
based on centimetres covered over a period of time. We
included studies that have taken advantage of statistical
advancements to minimise the challenges of studying
labour progression.27 We minimised potential bias in the
review process by searching major databases without any
restrictions, and considered studies conducted as long ago
as the 1950s. Our review included studies describing the
cervical dilatation patterns for close to 100 000 women of
diverse ethnicities, spread across major geographic regions
of
the
world.
We
employed
a
pragmatic
statistical
approach to address the challenges of generating confi-
dence bounds for pooled medians when only quantiles
and sample sizes are provided, and other distributional
parameters for the underlying study populations are not
available. Nonetheless, a few limitations need to be high-
lighted.
The main limitations of this review relate to the inherent
limitations in the design and conduct of the primary stud-
ies. Notable is the potential selection bias that could arise
from the populations selected for individual studies (e.g.
the exclusion of women who had CS during first stage, and
the inclusion of women with variable use of oxytocin aug-
mentation, epidural analgesia, and instrumental vaginal
birth). Although it is possible that the synthesis of these
studies could accentuate such bias, the general consistency
in the observed patterns of cervical dilatation across all
studies is reassuring. We believe that the inclusion of
women with certain interventions, albeit variable across
studies, strengthens the generalisability of our results to
current obstetric practice, as the presented data reflect the
diversity in healthcare practices within and across settings.
Another limitation arises from the non-uniformity in
weights used for pooling medians. As women in the studies
were not admitted at the same cervical dilatation, and thus
would not have contributed data equally to every centime-
tre of cervical dilatation for their cohort, the use of the
same sample size for weighting could have impacted the
pooled values, especially for those reported for the early
phase of labour (e.g. 2–3 cm and 3–4 cm). Therefore,
aggregated values for the period traditionally described as
the latent phase should be interpreted with caution.
Interpretation
Our findings support the observations from other primary
studies showing that the dilatation rate in healthy pregnant
women could be slower than 1 cm/hour.25,26,28 Although
such studies have generally selected women who received
no obstetric intervention to explore the natural history of
labour, in our review we found that women could have
slower rates of cervical dilatation, even in contexts where
obstetric interventions are the norm.

Labour progression patterns of low-risk women
 A remarkable finding of this review is the demonstration
of nonlinear changes in cervical dilatation rates throughout
the period commonly described as the active phase. For
instance, up to 50% of the nulliparous population analysed
progressed from a much slower (0.50 cm/hour at 3–4 cm) to
a much faster (2.04 cm/hour at 9–10 cm) rate, compared
with the accepted minimum threshold. The variability shown
by the 95th percentiles across studies confirms that although
it was not uncommon for some women to experience an even
slower cervical dilatation rate as they progressed in labour,
the nonlinear pattern remained preserved. Based on this find-
ing, it may be more clinically beneficial to conceptualise
labour pattern as a hyperbolic curve that is slower at the
beginning of the traditional active phase and faster towards
full dilatation, when prospectively making a clinical decision
about labour progress. Although this may be difficult to
implement in practice, especially because dilatation rates can
change very quickly, even in the same woman, it has the pro-
spect of reducing the premature diagnosis of dystocia in early
labour, and could potentially reduce the unnecessary use of
interventions to accelerate labour.
The clinical decision about whether or not interventions
should be applied to accelerate labour requires an under-
standing of when a woman is truly in her phase of natural
acceleration. Although the commonly agreed point of onset
of accelerative labour is 4 cm, as popularised by the start
of the partograph alert line, our review suggests that labour
may indeed not begin to accelerate substantially until 6 cm
in a considerable proportion of women. This observation
from one of the studies in this review was used as the basis
for the recent American College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists’ (ACOG) recommendation that standards of
care for the active phase of labour should only be applied
when women have reached a 6-cm threshold.6,11 The pat-
terns observed in the individual studies included in our
review and the aggregated estimates provide even more
robust evidence in support of this recommendation. We
propose that the revision of norms and standards for
labour care should evaluate the impact of these findings on
the starting point of the partograph alert line.
The use of arbitrary statistical limits to define the
boundaries for normal labour progression deserves a special
mention. Since the pioneer studies of Friedman, the 95th
percentiles have been arbitrarily taken as the upper limit of
normal labour duration or dilatation rate. Although this
offers the clinician a benchmark against which to evaluate
women in labour, it does not imply that labour within this
boundary cannot result in adverse outcomes. Rather, the
95th percentiles provide boundaries within which, when
maternal and fetal conditions are reassuring, a woman
should continue to be offered expectant, supportive, and
woman-centred labour care. This assertion is supported by
the similarity between the labour progression patterns
described in this review and those reported from study
populations with risk factors and childbirth-related mor-
bidities.29,30
Conclusions
The opportunity to confidently assess natural labour pro-
gression without any intervention or interference in current
obstetric practice is limited; however, new computational
methods in the included studies offer an insight into what
may have been responsible for the increasing medicalisation
of birth over the last two decades. The overall labour pro-
gression data within and across studies show that an expec-
tation of a minimum cervical dilatation threshold of 1 cm/
hour throughout labour is unrealistic for most healthy nul-
liparous and parous women. To improve birth outcomes,
it is essential to lower this expectation and conceptualise
labour progress as a potentially hyperbolic rather than a
linear process. The findings of our review call into question
the application of standards that are currently in use based
on research conducted more than 50 years ago. A potential
direction for future research could be the use of individ-
ual-level data set meta-analysis, where statistical methodol-
ogy using LMS (Lambda, Mu, and Sigma) parameters
could be explored to construct normalised centile stan-
dards, similar to its application for the development of
growth charts.31
