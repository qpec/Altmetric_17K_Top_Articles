A leading hypothesis proposes that increased human life span
since 1850 has resulted from decreased exposure to childhood
infections, which has reduced chronic inflammation and later-life
mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular disease, stroke,
and cancer. Early-life cohort mortality rate often predicts later-life
survival in humans, but such associations could arise from factors
other than disease exposure. Additionally, the impact of early-life
disease exposure on reproduction remains unknown, and thus
previous work ignores a major component of fitness through
which selection acts upon life-history strategy. We collected data
from seven 18th- and 19th-century Finnish populations experienc-
ing naturally varying mortality and fertility levels. We quantified
early-life disease exposure as the detrended child mortality rate
from infectious diseases during an individual’s first 5 y, controlling
for important social factors. We found no support for an associa-
tion between early-life disease exposure and all-cause mortality
risk after age 15 or 50. We also found no link between early-life
disease exposure and probability of death specifically from cardio-
vascular disease, stroke, or cancer. Independent of survival, there
was no evidence to support associations between early-life dis-
ease exposure and any of several aspects of reproductive perfor-
mance, including lifetime reproductive success and age at first
birth, in either males or females. Our results do not support the
prevailing assertion that exposure to infectious diseases in early
life has long-lasting associations with later-life all-cause mortality
risk or mortality putatively linked to chronic inflammation. Varia-
tion in adulthood conditions could therefore be the most likely
source of recent increases in adult life span.

n industrialized nations, human life expectancy at birth has
increased by around 3 mo/y between 1840 and 2002 (1). Al-
though this is linked to improvements in child survival rates,
there have been considerable increases in the life expectancy of
adults: In the United Kingdom in 1843, the mean expected age at
death of a 20-y-old was 60, whereas in 2011 it was 81 (2, 3), a
50% increase in remaining life span. Longer adult life expectancy
has been accompanied by increased incidence of previously rare
chronic health problems, and thus identifying the drivers of en-
hanced life span is an important question for global health.
Declines in adult mortality rate since the 18th century in Europe
were more closely linked to year of birth than to the year in
which mortality was assessed, leading to the hypothesis that
“the expectation of life was determined by the conditions which
existed during the child’s earlier years” (4). The “cohort mor-
bidity phenotype” hypothesis suggests that the link between de-
clining birth year mortality rate and increasing adult survival is
due to reduced exposure to infectious diseases in early life and
reduced lifelong burden of chronic inflammation (5–8). Thus,
individuals experiencing exposure to infectious disease in early
life are expected to have higher adulthood mortality risk.
It is hypothesized that early-life exposure to infectious dis-
eases could increase later-life mortality risk through a number of
physiological mechanisms (6). Bacterial and viral infections elicit
inflammatory immune responses, and chronic inflammation is
associated with atherosclerosis, increased risk of stroke, cardio-
vascular disease (CVD), and mortality (9). Thus, early-life dis-
ease exposure is expected to be linked to adult mortality risk
from these causes in particular (6). Support for this hypothesis
comes from studies showing that exposure to high levels of early-
life cohort mortality or infection is associated with middle-age
mortality from CVD (10, 11); that exposure to infection is as-
sociated with chronically high levels of inflammation (12, 13);
and that high levels of inflammation are associated with CVD
(14). This physiological mechanism is underpinned by the fact
that natural selection should favor the expression of robust im-
mune responses at young ages, even at the cost of lower later-life
survival (15).
Building on such knowledge, studies have tested the cohort
morbidity phenotype hypothesis by showing that early-life in-
fections are associated with chronic inflammation and impaired
later health (16, 17). A drawback is that these studies are performed
on modern populations with good health care and therefore cannot
estimate associations between early-life disease exposure and nat-
ural mortality risk. A second approach is to use historical data
on natural-mortality preindustrial populations and to link early-
life cohort mortality (a proxy for early-life disease exposure) with
later-life mortality (18–20). Studies of historical populations have,
however, experienced at least one of several shortcomings. First,
many studies are based on population-level statistics, meaning
Significance
Why has human life expectancy increased since 1850? A lead-
ing hypothesis proposes that limited exposure to childhood
infections has reduced lifelong inflammation and enhanced
survival, but tests of this hypothesis typically use all-cause
mortality rates to estimate disease exposure. Meanwhile, links
between early-life disease and reproduction have been neglected.
We used data from preindustrial Finnish populations to show that
early-life disease exposure was not associated with all-cause
mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, stroke, and can-
cer, or reproductive success. Our study therefore does not support
the prevailing contention that reduced exposure to early-life in-
fections has increased life expectancy in modern populations.

 they cannot identify factors allowing some individuals to live long
lives despite being born in high-mortality cohorts. Second, most
studies only consider all-cause cohort mortality rate as a measure
of disease exposure, which may be driven by nutrition and social
factors as well as disease. Third, it is often unknown which types
of deaths are associated with early stressors, obfuscating the
mechanism through which early-life disease exposure is associ-
ated with later mortality.
The majority of studies of early-life disease exposure have fo-
cused solely on associations with later-life mortality, despite the
fact that selection on life-history strategy should act through both
survival and reproductive success. Life-history theory predicts
that high mortality risk in early life should lead to earlier age at
maturity (21), but associations between early-life disease exposure
and between-individual variation in reproductive success have
been neglected. A series of studies have shown that early-life
trauma, such as sibling mortality, parental separation, disadvan-
tageous birth location, and famine (22–25), is associated with
earlier age at first reproduction and/or larger family size, sug-
gesting adoption of a “fast” life history in high-stress, high-mortality
environments. In contrast, childhood infections may have a non-
lethal but damaging impact upon physiology, which may impede
reproduction during adulthood (26). These could include infec-
tions after birth leading to stunted growth in childhood and
eventually reduced adult size (27), or even infections of focal in-
dividuals’ mothers leading to reduced birth weight, which may
lead to reduced birth weight of focal individuals’ offspring (28,
29). Nevertheless, it has been shown that the direction of the as-
sociation between final adult height and fertility is variable across
populations (30).
We used church register data collected from seven Finnish
populations across the 18th and 19th centuries to determine the
association between early-life exposure to infectious diseases and
(i) later-life mortality risk, (ii) cause of death, and (iii) reproduc-
tive success. These populations had no access to modern contra-
ception or health care (31), and as a result ∼40% of children died
of disease before age 15. Having survived to age 15, mean life span
in our sample was ∼56 y and individuals produced an average of
∼4 surviving offspring, with >99% of individuals born to parents
aged <50. We used cause-of-death data recorded by churches to
adopt a measure of disease exposure based on the local probability
of child death from infectious diseases during the early years of an
individual’s life. Crucially, we controlled for other salient variables
reflecting early-life conditions and known to influence fitness in
these populations (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 and Table S1), including
social class at birth (32), twin status (33), interbirth interval (34),
and season of birth (35).
Results
There was considerable between-year variation in the prevalence
of deaths from infectious diseases in the early years of our study
individuals’ lives. We used these data to calculate a measure of
early-life exposure to infectious diseases for each of the first 5 y
of life of each individual based on the proportion of children
dying from infectious diseases in their parish in each year. We
recorded the number of children aged 0–10 alive in each parish
in each year, 1751–1855 (a total of 195,170 person-y). In 194,182
(>99.5%) cases, the child had a known cause of death or sur-
vived, whereas in the remaining 988 cases, the child died of an
unknown cause; these 988 cases were not included in our cal-
culations of early-life disease exposure (SI Appendix, Table S2).
During these years, 4,780 child deaths of known cause were
recorded, with 73% due to infectious diseases (SI Appendix,
Table S3). We calculated annual parish-specific variation in
child mortality rate from infectious diseases by dividing the
number of child (aged 0–10) deaths in each parish due to infec-
tions in each year, 1751–1855, by the number of children alive in
each parish in the same year. The child mortality rate from in-
fectious diseases varied substantially across the study period in all
seven parishes (Fig. 1). We detrended the child mortality rate from
infectious diseases by applying a Hodrick–Prescott filter to data
from each parish using the R package “mFilter”, with a filtering
term of 100. This decomposed variation in child mortality rate
from infectious diseases in each parish into a long-term smoothed
“trend” component (Fig. 1) and the short-term deviation from
the trend, or the “cycle” (Fig. 2). The cycle component for each
year was multiplied by 100 to aid model convergence, and we
refer to this measure herein as annual “disease exposure” (Fig.
2). Each individual was therefore defined by their potential early
exposure to infections, rather than simply the level of all-cause
cohort mortality (8, 18, 19), on a continuous quantitative scale,
accounting for temporal changes in conditions and specific to the
parish in which they were born. We designed analyses to de-
termine whether our measure of disease exposure in each of
the first 5 y of life was associated with later-life survival and
reproductive success.
Mortality Risk. Our mixed-effects Cox model analyses showed that
greater disease exposure in each of the first 5 y of life was not
associated with increased mortality risk in adulthood (n = 7,283).
Controlling for a higher mortality risk among poor individuals
and males and variation between parishes as well as other fixed
and random effects (Table 1), disease exposure measured in
each of the first 5 y of life was not significantly associated with
hazard of mortality after age 15, nor was the association between
early-life disease exposure and mortality risk dependent upon
parish, social class, or sex (SI Appendix, Table S4). When we
restricted our analyses to individuals who survived to at least the
age of 50 (n = 3,822) and who were therefore most likely to
experience stroke, CVD, and cancer, we again found no evidence
for an association between early-life disease exposure and mor-
tality risk and no indication of interactions with individual parish,
social class, or sex (SI Appendix, Table S4).
Cause of Death. Mixed-effects Cox models showed that there was
no significant association between early-life disease exposure and
cause of death. We tested for an association between disease
exposure in each of the first 5 y of life and death from CVD,
stroke, and cancer, on which the cohort morbidity phenotype
focuses (8). Individuals were scored as 1 (a “failure”) if they died
of CVD, stroke, or cancer, and 0 if they died of other causes or
were censored without dying (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Table S5).
As above, we first performed the analysis on all individuals who

 survived to at least the age of 15. There was no statistical support
for an association between early-life disease exposure in any of the
first 5 y of life and death from CVD, stroke, or cancer (SI Ap-
pendix, Table S6). Although there was some evidence to support
an interaction between early disease exposure and social class
[disease year 4–social class (poor) hazard 0.79; 95% confidence
interval 0.62–1.00; χ2
1 = 4.17; P = 0.0.041], suggesting that poor
individuals with higher early-life disease exposure in the fourth
year of life were less likely to later die of infection (SI Appendix,
Table S7), this interaction was only weakly statistically supported,
with an Akaike Information Criterion value relative to the base
model (ΔAIC) of −2.02 (36). Nevertheless, it suggested a trend
for a mildly protective effect of early disease exposure and later
death risk from CVD, stroke, or cancer in poor individuals. We
also repeated this analysis on individuals who survived to at least
age 50, because the majority (263/346) of individuals affected by
these death causes were aged over 50. Once again, there was no
evidence that early-life disease exposure was associated with cause
of death, nor any evidence for interactions between disease ex-
posure and parish, social class, or sex (SI Appendix, Table S6).
Lifetime Reproductive Success. We next assessed links between
early-life disease exposure and later-life reproductive success in
individuals who married and survived to at least age 50 and who
had therefore completed their reproductive life spans with the
opportunity to reproduce. We analyzed data from females and
males separately, due to their differing social and physiological
factors affecting reproductive schedules. First, we used linear
mixed-effects models to show that there was no association
between early-life disease exposure and Box–Cox–transformed
lifetime reproductive success (LRS) in females (n = 1,512), de-
fined as the number of offspring an individual produced who
survived to age 15 (best-fitting single year; disease year 1 esti-
mate −0.0202 ± 0.0112; χ2
1 = 3.25; P = 0.071; SI Appendix, Table
S8). This model controlled for variation between parishes (χ2
6 =
68.60; P < 0.001), lower LRS in poor compared with rich indi-
viduals (estimate −0.24 ± 0.04; χ2
1 = 44.77; P < 0.001), and
nonsignificant effects of birth interval, birth season, and twinning
status. There was also no statistical support for interactions be-
tween early disease exposure and social class or parish (SI Ap-
pendix, Table S8). In males (n = 1,333), there was once again no
support for an association between early-life disease exposure
and LRS (best-fitting single year; disease year 4 estimate 0.0068 ±
0.0118; χ2
1 = 0.33; P = 0.563), nor any support for interactions
with social class or parish (SI Appendix, Table S8).
We next determined whether there were any links between
early-life disease exposure and other components of reproduc-
tion that constitute LRS, namely age at first reproduction, number
of children born, or child survival rate. In neither sex, however, did
we find any support for associations between early-life disease
exposure and any of these measures of reproductive success, either
as a main effect or in interactions with social class or parish (SI
Appendix, Tables S9–S11).
Discussion
It has been hypothesized that recent increases in human life span
have been brought about by reduced exposure to infectious
diseases in early life and reduction of lifelong inflammation and
associated chronic diseases such as CVD, stroke, and cancer (5–
8). Tests of this hypothesis have used data from historical pop-
ulations to support a link between cohort all-cause mortality rate
and later-life survival, but have not assessed later-life survival in
relation to measures of early-life disease exposure based on
disease prevalence or determined how early disease exposure is
linked to mortality risk specifically from CVD, stroke, and can-
cer. Studies of how early-life disease exposure may impact upon
later-life reproductive success are also extremely rare. We used
data from seven preindustrial Finnish populations and addressed
these shortcomings by (i) quantifying variation in early-life dis-
ease exposure as the proportion of children alive in each of the
first 5 y of an individual’s life who died of infectious diseases;
(ii) assessing links between disease exposure and cause of death;
and (iii) determining the association between early-life disease
exposure and reproduction. Our results show that individuals
experiencing higher early-life disease exposure do not experience
higher all-cause mortality risk or risk of mortality from CVD,
stroke, or cancer during adulthood. We also found no support
for associations between early-life disease exposure and re-
productive performance in either males or females. Our results
do not support the link between early-life disease exposure and

 chronic inflammation-associated mortality risk, which forms the
crux of the cohort morbidity phenotype hypothesis.
Our analyses showed that, controlling for individual parish,
social class, sex, birth season, twinning status, birth interval, and
temporal changes in disease exposure (Fig. 1), there was no
statistical support for an association between early-life disease
exposure and mortality risk after age 15 (Table 1 and SI Ap-
pendix, Table S4). Previous studies have found evidence for links
between early-life cohort mortality rate and later survival (4, 5,
8), but without considering that such a measure of disease ex-
posure could be confounded by spatial variation, social status,
other intrinsic and extrinsic conditions as well as disease expo-
sure, and improvements in living conditions and hygiene across
time. Demographic studies have applied statistical techniques
such as Hodrick–Prescott decomposition to trending environ-
mental data and found generally weak associations between early
and later cohort mortality (37–40), although some of these
studies have still detected significant correlations (19, 41). By
applying Hodrick–Prescott decomposition, we were able to ac-
count for declines in death rates from infection across time by
using deviations from this trend as our measure of early-life
disease exposure (Fig. 2). Unlike these studies, however, we use
a measure of disease exposure explicitly based on prevalence of
deaths from the infectious diseases most likely to affect infants
(SI Appendix, Tables S2 and S3).
Early-life disease exposure may influence later-life health in
a number of ways, and it is this complexity that may have pre-
vented us from detecting significant associations. For example,
early infections may have negative associations with later health
through chronic physiological “scarring,” but may also have
positive associations due to acquired immunity or selection of
the most robust individuals who were able to survive the harsh
early environment (42). There may also be changes in the fac-
tors that influence mortality in different parts of the life course,
such that the relative importance of scarring and selection may
vary with age (43) and the effects of early adversity may be
short-lived, or be negligible in comparison with events that
occur in adult life (39). A study using data from Sweden, col-
lected 1813–1968 and calculating early-life disease risk based
on neonatal mortality rates, showed that effects of exposure on
mortality varied with age: Individuals born during times of
higher neonatal mortality rates showed higher mortality initially
but lower mortality in later life (44). These results suggest ini-
tial scarring effects of disease at younger ages, followed by a
strengthening influence of acquired immunity and/or selection
of robust individuals at later ages. Thus, rather than being
unimportant for later-life survival, early-life infections may
have both negative (through scarring) and positive (through
acquired immunity and/or selection) associations with later
survival, which may combine to culminate in no detectable
overall effect.
The cohort morbidity phenotype (5–8) proposes a link be-
tween infection, chronic inflammation, and risk of CVD, stroke,
and cancer (14). The exact prevalence of these diseases in our
study population is unknown: Although 9.6% of deaths were due
to CVD or stroke, a further 13.7% of deaths were due to “old
age” and could have been related to chronic inflammation (SI
Appendix, Table S5). Exposure to infection in early life has also
been linked to respiratory disorders in later life (16, 17, 45),
which is noteworthy given that 14.9% of deaths in our studied
individuals were from tuberculosis (SI Appendix, Table S5). Fo-
cusing on deaths from CVD, stroke, and cancer, we did not find
evidence that early-life disease exposure was associated with
these causes of death, linked to chronic inflammation by the
cohort morbidity phenotype (SI Appendix, Table S6). It should
be noted that, with only 346/7,283 (5%) individuals scored as
dying of CVD, stroke, or cancer, our statistical power to detect
links between early disease exposure and cause of death may
have been low. Meanwhile, studies of contemporary populations
experiencing high exposure to infection and high levels of in-
flammatory markers rarely show signs of CVD despite their short
life spans, suggesting that a low level of CVD, stroke, and cancer
is simply the ancestral state and that high prevalence of these con-
ditions may be a consequence of longer life spans in industrialized
populations (46). Finally, it may be possible that adverse effects of
chronic inflammation are only apparent in populations experi-
encing resource-rich or pathogen-poor environments, and that in
our (relatively) resource-poor and pathogen-rich environments,
heightened inflammatory responses are advantageous or neutral.
Our study individuals were born before 1850, and thus it is possible
that our results may not be generalizable to later cohorts, who ex-
perienced increased adult nutrition and health care. On the other
hand, if chronic inflammation does not lead to CVD, stroke, and
cancer in low-nutrition, high-pathogen environments, then the co-
hort morbidity phenotype would not offer an explanation for longer
modern life spans being due to reduced or delayed instances of
these disorders.
The majority of studies of early-life disease exposure have
focused solely on associations with mortality, and our results are
among the first to address links between early-life disease ex-
posure and reproductive success. We found, however, that as-
sociations between early-life disease exposure and lifetime
reproductive success, age at first reproduction, lifetime breeding
success, and child survival rate were absent in both sexes. Life-
history theory predicts that high mortality risk in early life should
lead to earlier age at maturity (21), which should be associ-
ated with higher LRS, predictions that have been supported by
population- (23, 47) and individual-level studies showing that
adverse early-life conditions such as experience of mortality,
deprived upbringing, experience of famine, or chronic childhood
illness are associated with earlier age at first birth and higher
fertility (22, 23, 25). In contrast, early-life stressors such as low
food availability have been linked to later-life health problems
(48) and, in our study population, reduced reproductive success
(49, 50). These effects may be mediated through neonatal in-
fections that stunt growth and diminish later reproductive suc-
cess (26, 27) or maternal infections that reduce the birth weight
of focal individuals (28, 29). In a historical German population,
birth during a high-mortality period was associated with lower
child survivorship in males and lower lifetime births in females
(51). Thus, adverse conditions in early pre- or postnatal life may
slow growth and development, affect reproductive physiology,
and postpone first birth (52). As with survival, the conflicting
negative (scarring) and positive (selection) effects of disease
exposure may underpin our finding of no overall association
between early-life disease exposure and later-life reproductive
success. Alternatively, the lack of association in the present study
could indicate that links detected in previous studies were due to
factors other than disease. A recent study on data from 251 20th-
century English women used path analysis to show that although
social class was linked to age at first birth and illness in the first
year of life was linked to adult height, there was no direct or
indirect effect of childhood illness on age at first birth or LRS
(53). Our results (with n > 1,000) are therefore unlikely to reflect
lack of statistical power, and it may therefore simply be that
effects of early-life infections on reproduction are weak and
overshadowed by socioeconomic factors.
Unlike many previous studies testing for links between early-
life disease exposure and later-life fitness, we (i) incorporated
data on disease prevalence into our measure of early-life disease
exposure; (ii) determined associations between disease exposure
and cause of death; (iii) assessed associations between disease
exposure and reproductive success; (iv) controlled for several
important social factors; (v) detrended our measure of early-life
disease exposure to account for temporal trends; and (vi) ex-
amined early-life effects not only around birth but up to age 5.
An “ideal” study would link full health records from each indi-
vidual documenting previous illness with lifetime follow-up on
survival and reproduction. Our results should be interpreted
with the acknowledgment that infection of any individual in
our population at any time is unknown. Instead, our measure of
disease exposure assumes that a higher child mortality rate from

 infection meant that, on average, individuals experiencing such
conditions were more likely to be exposed to infections. In ad-
dition, we included the 22% of child deaths due to “unknown
diseases” in the “infectious” category because deaths from in-
fection were generally more common than those due to other
causes, especially in children (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S5),
but this may have introduced noise into our calculation of dis-
ease exposure if not all such unknown diseases were indeed in-
fectious. It therefore remains possible that inability to detect an
association between early disease exposure and fitness is due to
our way of calculating early disease exposure. Ability to accu-
rately determine cause of death with poor medical knowledge is
a general caveat of using historical data. These two caveats aside,
a strength is that we have used parish-specific records rather than
nationwide figures, thereby gaining the most geographically re-
stricted estimate of disease exposure possible.
The results of our study strongly challenge the hypothesis that
links between early- and later-life mortality rates are mediated
through effects of early-life infectious diseases on chronic in-
flammation. Longitudinal study of contemporary populations
will be essential for detecting the mechanisms underpinning such
effects (53), for example for disentangling the role of early and
later conditions in influencing mortality risk. With the increasing
availability of national, individual-based health data, this en-
deavor will be achievable in a more explicit manner than shown
here. Our study, however, uses data from 100 cohorts of a pre-
industrial population and controls for variation in social class
and birth circumstances to provide a unique snapshot of how
early-life conditions may have influenced human populations for
much of our evolutionary history (6, 7). We conclude, in agree-
ment with several other authors (37, 39, 40), that the influence of
improved adult, rather than childhood, conditions is likely to
have driven recent improvements in life expectancy.
Materials and Methods
Study Population and Data Collection. We investigated associations between
early-life disease exposure and later-life survival and reproductive success
using longitudinal data collected from 18th- to 19th-century church records in
seven populations, termed “parishes,” located across the southern half of
Finland. Before the 1870s, these populations had high birth and death rates,
primitive agricultural technology, and unreliable contraception and medical
care (31) and were strictly monogamous. Individuals were divided into two
social classes: “Rich” individuals included farm owners, merchants, and
craftsmen, and “poor” individuals included crofters and laborers (32).
Causes of Death and Early-Life Disease Exposure. We have collected data in-
cluding birth, parentage, marriage, reproduction, and death for a total of
72,564 individuals in the parishes of Hiittinen, Ikaalinen, Jaakkima, Kustavi,
Pulkkila, Rautu, and Rymättylä born 1702–2012. We restricted our analyses
to 21,539 individuals born after 1750, because before this records were
patchy, and born before 1851, ensuring that we only used data from indi-
viduals with natural mortality and fertility (31). We further restricted our
analyses to individuals who survived to at least age 15 (15,237) and those of
known maternal identity and social class (n = 7,327). This was done to ensure
that we captured longer-term effects of disease exposure and to control for
variation in survival and reproductive success between families and social
classes (32). Finally, because birth order (34), twinning status (33), and birth
season (35) are all linked to fitness in this population, we restricted our
analyses to individuals for whom this information was recorded, leaving a
final sample size of 7,283 individuals, born 1751–1850. None of our study
individuals moved between parishes between birth and adulthood.
Based on previous studies examining links between early exposure to
mortality and later-life health and fitness (19, 38–40), we aimed to estimate
an individual’s experience of infectious diseases in their first 5 y of life, as
illustrated by the prevalence of death from infectious diseases recorded by
the church (54). Because children and adults are vulnerable to different
diseases in this population (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S5), we recorded the
number of individuals aged 0–10 y who were alive in the parish in each year,
1751–1855, a total of 194,182 person-y (SI Appendix, Table S2), during which
time 4,780 children died of a known cause, 73% of which were due to in-
fectious diseases (SI Appendix, Table S3); 22% of deaths were from an un-
known disease, which we included in the infectious category. We gained a
parish-specific measure of disease exposure for each year by dividing the
number of children dying of infectious diseases in a given year in a given
parish by the number of children alive in the same parish in the same year
(Fig. 1). Thus, our measure of early-life disease exposure is based on the child
mortality rate from infectious diseases during an individual’s early life. We
then detrended this measure using Hodrick–Prescott decomposition, and
used the deviations from the trend (the cycle component) as our measure of
disease exposure (Fig. 2). Early-life disease exposure was multiplied by 100
before use in analysis to aid model convergence.
Statistical Analysis. We determined the association between disease exposure
in each of the first 5 y of life and later-life fitness, controlling for other
potentially confounding effects (SI Appendix, Table S1). All models described
below were mixed-effects models with maternal identity and birth year as
random effects, to account for between-family and -cohort variation in fit-
ness. All models estimated the association between early-life disease expo-
sure and fitness after controlling for the following fixed effects, which were
retained in all models. Parish (seven levels), social class (rich or poor), and sex
(male or female) were all included as categorical fixed effects. Because child
survival is higher for those born in August, September, and October com-
pared with other months (35), birth season was included as a two-level
categorical variable (high or low survival). First-born males have higher
prospects of wealth inheritance, marriage, and reproduction in this pop-
ulation, and individuals born with a longer intervening period after their
previous sibling may have higher fitness (34). We incorporated both of these
effects into a four-level categorical variable, interbirth interval (IBI; firstborn;
born <2 y after sibling; born <3 y after sibling; born >3 y after sibling). Fi-
nally, all models accounted for the link between twin status at birth and
later-life fitness (33) by including twin status at birth (singleton or twin) as
a categorical fixed effect. All analyses were conducted in R version 3.2.3
(https://www.r-project.org/).
Mortality Risk. We determined the association between early-life disease
exposure and mortality risk after the age of 15 in 7,283 individuals using
mixed-effects Cox models in the R package coxme. We constructed a “base”
model containing the fixed and random effects described above (model 0)
and then built a series of models testing the association between early-life
disease exposure and mortality risk. We considered disease exposure in each
of the first 5 y of an individual’s life as separate variables: year 0 (birth year),
year 1, year 2, year 3, and year 4. We first tested for main effects of disease
exposure in each of the first 5 y of life separately by (models 1–5) comparing
the base model with separate models containing the disease exposure of
each of the first 5 y, fitted as covariates, using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs),
where the χ2-distributed test statistic is calculated as −2*(LogLikmodel1 −
LogLikmodel2). We next (model 6) fitted all 5 disease-exposure years as
covariates in the same model and compared model 6 with model 0 using an
LRT. We determined which of models 1–5 fitted best by comparing their
Akaike information criterion (AIC) values, where the lowest value provided
the best fit (36). We did not encounter any situation where more than one
of models 1–5 outperformed model 0. This allowed us to determine which
disease-exposure year was most strongly associated with mortality risk. We
took the best-fitting disease-exposure year forward into model 7, which
tested for a nonlinear association between the best-fitting disease-exposure
year and survival by comparing the model with a linear term of disease
exposure to one with both linear and quadratic terms. Finally, we tested for
interactions involving the best-fitting disease-exposure year by comparing
the model with the main effect of the best-fitting disease-exposure year
with models with interactions between disease exposure and parish (model
8), social class (model 9), and sex (model 10). We subsequently restricted the
analyses to individuals who lived to at least age 50 (n = 3,822), because these
individuals are most likely to fall victim to CVD, stroke, and cancer.
Cause of Death. We next aimed to determine whether early-life disease ex-
posure was associated with increased risk of death from stroke, CVD, or
cancer versus other causes. Each individual was scored as dying from stroke,
CVD, or cancer (1; 346 individuals), with the remainder (6,937 individuals)
scored as 0. Cause-of-death analyses were performed using mixed-effects Cox
models, following the same fixed- and random-effects structure and model
selection procedure as described above. We then repeated this analysis on
individuals who survived until at least the age of 50, because 263/346 (76%) of
deaths from these causes occurred in individuals aged 50 and over.
Lifetime Reproductive Success. We next determined the association between
early-life disease exposure and later-life reproductive success by quantifying
lifetime reproductive success as the number of children an individual pro-
duced who survived to age 15. From the original sample size of 7,283, we

 removed data from 1,200 individuals who were unmarried or whose marriage
status was unknown; 488 individuals who had unknown LRS; 1,417 individuals
whose reproductive success was unknown or whose children had unknown
fates to age 15; and 1,333 individuals who failed to survive to the age of 50
and therefore complete their reproductive life span (49). We therefore fo-
cused on fertility differences within marriage to determine differences in
reproductive capacity, rather than “mating success” (or marriage), which is
influenced by a host of social and cultural factors that contribute to finding
a partner. The final dataset for analysis of LRS contained 2,845 individuals,
with 1,512 females and 1,333 males. The analyses were separated by sex
due to the biological and social differences governing variation in re-
productive success between the sexes in this population. We visually
inspected diagnostic plots of several different modeling structures, in-
cluding linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) of untransformed LRS; LMMs
of log-transformed LRS; LMMs of Box–Cox–transformed LRS; and gener-
alized linear mixed-effects models of untransformed LRS with Poisson,
Poisson-lognormal, and negative binomial error structures. In both males
and females, Box–Cox transformation provided the most favorable diagnostics,
so LRS was modeled using LMMs of (LRS+1)0.5 in the R package lme4. The
fixed- and random-effects structures of models 1–9 were the same as for the
Cox models described above, although because we performed separate
analysis for males and females, we did not fit model 10, which included the
interaction between early-life disease exposure and sex.
Finally, we tested for associations between early-life disease exposure and
the reproductive traits that contribute to LRS. We therefore performed
analyses determining whether early-life disease exposure was associated with
later age at first reproduction, reduced lifetime breeding success (number of
children born), and/or child survival rate to age 15. These analyses are de-
scribed in full in SI Appendix.
