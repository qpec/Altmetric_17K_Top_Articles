Acute brain changes are expected after concussion, yet there is growing evidence of persistent abnormalities well
beyond clinical recovery and clearance to return to play. Multiparametric MRI is a powerful approach to non-
invasively study structure-function relationships in the brain, however it remains challenging to interpret the
complex and heterogeneous cascade of brain changes that manifest after concussion. Emerging conjunctive,
data-driven analysis approaches like linked independent component analysis can integrate structural and
functional imaging data to produce linked components that describe the shared inter-subject variance across
images. These linked components not only offer the potential of a more comprehensive understanding of the
underlying neurobiology of concussion, but can also provide reliable information at the level of an individual
athlete. In this study, we analyzed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
within a cohort of female varsity rugby players (n = 52) through the in- and off-season, including concussed
athletes (n = 21) who were studied longitudinally at three days, three months and six months after a diagnosed
concussion. Linked components representing co-varying white matter microstructure and functional network
connectivity characterized (a) the brain's acute response to concussion and (b) persistent alterations beyond
clinical recovery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these long-term brain changes related to specific aspects of
a concussion history and allowed us to monitor individual athletes before and longitudinally after a diagnosed
concussion.
1. Introduction
Concussion is a prevalent injury for young athletes participating in
contact sports and it provokes an acute set of heterogeneous symptoms
that generally recover quickly. However, the underlying changes in the
brain that are responsible for these symptoms and the long-term con-
sequences of concussion remain elusive. There is a critical need to
understand

changes

 potentially lasting effects of early and/or multiple concussions (Kamins
et al. 2017).
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-
fMRI) are sensitive to different attributes (i.e. structure and functional)
of the neurobiological cascade following concussion (Bigler and
Maxwell 2012), a cascade that appears to persist beyond clinical re-
covery and clearance to return to play (Churchill et al. 2017). Tradi-
tionally, each MRI metric is analyzed separately and related to each
other post-hoc. Such approaches fail to take advantage of the inter-
twined structure-function relationship in the brain and typically pro-
vide limited understanding of an individual longitudinally. A data-
driven analysis that examines structure-function relationships jointly
could yield powerful insights into the underlying neurobiological
changes in young concussed athletes over time (Shin et al. 2017).
Linked independent component analysis (LICA) is a data-driven
approach that evaluates shared inter-subject variations across the dif-
ferent MRI measures and provides a more coherent appreciation of the
underlying structure-function modes of variation (Groves et al. 2011;
Sui et al. 2012). LICA is a powerful approach that decomposes multi-
parametric imaging data in an unbiased manner to produce components
of (a) spatial maps that show where each of the image-derived metrics
of interest (i.e. DTI parameters, rs-fMRI network (RSN) connectivity)
co-vary together across subjects and (b) common component weights.
Component weights represent to what extent an individual subject ex-
presses a linked component at a particular time. When investigating
longitudinal multiparametric data this analysis approach may allow a
more complete picture of how an individual concussed athlete's brain
measures evolve together throughout recovery.
Here we examined co-varying changes in the brain's structure (DTI)-
function (rs-fMRI) relationships in a cohort of female varsity rugby
players over a five-year period. The MRI data from non-concussed
rugby players throughout the in- and off-season were compared to
concussed athletes acutely (24–72 h) and longitudinally (3-months and
6-months) post-concussion. We hypothesized that linked rs-fMRI and
DTI components would characterize acute neurobiological mechanisms
post-concussion and that there would be distinct brain abnormalities
that persist beyond clinical and symptomatic recovery. Given the ex-
isting literature (Alosco et al. 2017), we predicted that the expression of
these linked components would relate to concussion history. Further-
more, because this approach interrogates the imaging structure-func-
tion data together, it may provide a more reliable way to monitor in-
dividual concussed athletes longitudinally.
2. Methods
2.1. Patient recruitment and ethics approval
This study was approved by the University of Western Ontario's
Health Sciences Research Ethics Board. Informed consent was obtained
prior to the start of each season. All female rugby athletes on the varsity
team were invited to participate and only sports-related concussions
were enrolled in the longitudinal post-concussion protocol. Exclusion
criteria included a previous concussion within 6-months of data col-
lection, pre-existing systemic diseases or MRI exclusion criteria (metal
fragments, implanted devices, severe heart disease, non-removable
body piercings, or tattoos containing metallic inks). This longitudinal
study followed the women's rugby team (ages 18–22, mean age
[SD] = 20.1[1]) over a five-year period of national competition.
Participants did not partake in all seasons. Table 1 details the activities
during the season. We gathered 74 in-season and 63 off-season data sets
that included returning players without a diagnosed concussion within
the past 6-months. The in-season data was acquired during a high in-
tensity training camp involving multiple daily contact practices and
games as the participants strived to make the team. The off-season data
was acquired in the winter term, 2–3 months after the regular season
ended (approximately 6-months after the in-season scan). Players with

 a diagnosed concussion (n = 21) were assessed 24–72 h, 3-months and
6-months post-concussion.
2.2. Clinical assessment
Players suspected of a self-reported concussion were assessed at the
Fowler Kennedy Sports Medicine Clinic within 24–72 h of their injury
where an experienced Sports Medicine physician diagnosed a concus-
sion based on a mechanism of injury consistent with TBI and Sport
Concussion Assessment Tool (version 3) measures. SCAT3 was per-
formed in accordance with the instructional guidelines (“SCAT3.,”
2013). The SCAT3 is composed of the Glasgow coma scale (GCS), the
Maddocks Score and a cognitive and physical evaluation to evaluate the
athlete's orientation, concentration, balance and coordination. The GCS
assesses an athlete's eye, verbal, and motor responses and the Maddocks
score consists of 5 questions to assess short-term memory. The SCAT3
also scores 22 possible symptoms (symptom score) on a scale from 0 to
6 (symptom severity score). We investigated the relationship between
our MRI results with the SCAT3 self-reported symptoms and severity as
these two measures were the only measures significantly different
acutely post-concussion reported in a previous study of these athletes
(Schranz et al. 2017). We also documented the time since the most
recent concussion (in months) and the self-reported total number of
concussions in their history and included previous concussions as a
predictor of neuroimaging changes post-concussion (Table A.1).
2.3. MRI acquisition
All MRI data was acquired on a 3-Tesla MR scanner (Prisma,
Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil. A coronal
T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence (echo time (TE)/repetition time
(TR) = 85/7640 ms, flip angle = 120°, matrix size = 320 × 256, field
of view (FOV) = 220 mm × 179 mm, number of slices = 43, slice
thickness = 4 mm), a sagittal T1-weighted magnetization-prepared
rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) (TE/TR = 2.94/

confirm a mild traumatic brain injury with no evidence of cerebral
edema and were used for image registration. Approximately 20 min into
the scan, one 10-min rs-fMRI gradient echo echo-planar imaging se-
quence (TE/TR = 30/2500 ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix size = 80 × 80,
FOV = 240 mm × 240 mm,
number
of
slices = 45,
slice
thick-
ness = 3 mm) was performed while the individual was simply asked to
remain still with eyes open. Finally, a spin echo DTI sequence (TE/
TR = 79/7200 ms, matrix size = 98 × 98, FOV = 200 mm × 200 mm,
number of slices = 64, slice thickness = 2 mm, b1 = 0, b2 = 1000 s/
mm2, gradient directions = 64) was used for creating diffusion-
weighted images.
2.4. MRI preprocessing
The rs-fMRI and DTI data were preprocessed and analyzed using
FMRIB FSL software (version 5.0.9) (Jenkinson et al. 2012). The rs-
fMRI data was screened for excessive motion (> 1 mm) and any sub-
jects with a mean relative displacement > 0.5 mm were either trun-
cated to only include low motion data or were excluded. All remaining
data was preprocessed using the following standard steps: motion cor-
rection by affine registration to the middle volume, brain extraction,
5 mm full width half maximum (FWHM) smoothing, and high-pass fil-
tering at 0.01 Hz. Preprocessed data was de-noised further using single-
dataset ICA with automatic dimension calculation. Components that
were composed of voxels outside the brain, in the CSF, primarily white
matter, with a high frequency profile or related to motion artifacts were
regressed from the data (Griffanti et al. 2017). Cleaned data was re-
gistered to the corresponding MPRAGE structural T1-weighted image
that was in turn registered to a standard MNI 2 mm brain-extracted
standard template using linear registration with 12 degrees of freedom.
Cleaned and registered rs-fMRI data were analyzed using temporally
concatenated ICA to identify the ten RSNs by cross correlating with
well-established reference template spatial maps (Nickerson et al. 2017;
Smith et al. 2009). The default mode network (DMN) was split into
anterior and posterior sections of the network and each correlated with
the reference template. Dual regression algorithms were used to back-
project these networks and produce RSNs at the single subject and
session level (Beckmann et al. 2005). These individual RSN maps were
normalized to create z-statistic images for each subject's session and
each RSN. Statistical maps were down-sampled by a factor of 2 to 4 mm
isotropic voxels to facilitate higher-level computational analyses
(Groves et al. 2011).
DTI data was first corrected for head movement and eddy currents
using the eddy tool in FSL, and then the data was masked using the non-
diffusion weighted volume and a diffusion tensor was fit to each voxel.
These preprocessed diffusion images were than analyzed using the
tract-based spatial statistics tools (TBSS) (Smith et al. 2006). This in-
volved further preprocessing where fractional anisotropy (FA) diffusion
maps were eroded and end slices were removed. These eroded images
were inspected visually for any artifacts. Images were then non-linearly
registered to a 1 mm isotropic FA template image, which in turn was
registered and transformed to 1 mm isotropic MNI space. All subjects'
diffusion images were merged and a mean FA skeleton was made with a
threshold of FA > 0.2. Each individual's diffusion maps are projected
onto this skeletonized map and down-sampled to 2 mm isotropic voxels.
This was repeated for each diffusion metric to generate several skele-
tonized maps for each subject's session(s).
2.5. Linked independent component analysis
We investigated the shared inter-subject variations across 3 diffu-
sion and 3 RSN maps to remain consistent with previous LICA appli-
cations (Groves et al. 2012; Wolfers et al. 2017). In particular, we in-
vestigated skeletonized maps of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity
(AD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps as well as z-statistical images
quantifying whole-brain voxel-wise connectivity with the posterior
default mode network (DMN), cerebellar, and executive control RSNs.
These networks were chosen based on previous results (Manning et al.
2017) and their potential functional relevance with respect to common
concussion symptoms. An iterative LICA was performed using subject-
specific spatial maps in FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/
FLICA) with 10,000 iterations monitoring the free energy of the de-
composition. A common mixing matrix containing the components'
weights is common across all image-derived metrics. Data was de-
composed into 15 linked independent components that are comprised
of (1) spatial maps for each imaging-derived metric displaying specific
regions that co-vary across subjects and (2) common component
weights (Fig. 1A). Each image-derived metric of interest contributes a
fractional amount to each component (Fig. 1B). The z-normalization is
calculated independently for each linked independent component at
every modality and the normalization factor includes the modality
weights (fraction of each modality contribution) and the estimated
modality-independent SNR (Groves et al. 2012). Generally n/4 is
chosen as the model order, however we conservatively used a lower
model order to avoid over-fitting given the longitudinal data. We re-
peated the analysis using ± 1 model orders to confirm the robustness of
our results (Wolfers et al. 2017).
2.6. Statistical analysis
Linked components were deemed clinically relevant based on

 significant clinical predictors of component weights or if component
weights were significantly different amongst subject visits (i.e. non-
concussed in-season and off-season, and concussed athletes 24–72 h, 3-
months and 6-months post-concussion). We did not include components
that were dominated by a single subject (i.e. describing > 10% of the
variance). The remaining component weights were analyzed using a
linear mixed model within MATLAB (fitlme function) to determine
significant predictors which included the number and severity of SCAT3
symptoms, age at the time of the scan and number of self-reported
previous concussions with a fixed factor of subject visit while control-
ling for the longitudinal nature of the data through a random factor for
subject ID number. The differences amongst subject visits was assessed
using an SPSS mixed model approach with subject ID set as a random
factor and age as a covariate, and post-hoc comparisons of the linearly
independent estimated marginal means of component weights were
assessed and corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni cor-
rection. Additionally we examined repeated within-subject data over
time from concussed subjects with complete data (i.e. their most recent
pre-concussion scan, 24–72 h, 3-months and 6-months post-concus-
sion). We used repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Greenhouse-
Geisser corrected p-values to investigate athlete's component weights
before and longitudinally post-concussion.

 3. Results
3.1.1. Linked ICA decomposition
In total, 182 complete MRI datasets from 52 individual subjects
were included in the LICA. We gathered 74 in-season and 63 off-season
datasets and excluded six subjects for motion or data reconstruction
problems (71 in- and 60 off-season) and these subjects had not ex-
perienced a concussion within 6-months (average [SD] = 0.56 [0.8]
concussions ranging from 0 to 3 previous concussions that occurred on
average [SD] 36 [28] months before the commencement of the study).
We included 21 diagnosed concussions at 24–72 h (n = 21), then 3-
month (n = 17) and 6-month (n = 13) follow-ups. Eight concussions
occurred early in the season before that specific subject's in-season data
could be acquired and limited repeated measures analysis. SCAT3
symptom score and severity were both significantly elevated 24–72 h
post-concussion compared to both in- and off-season data and re-
covered by 3-months post-concussion (Table A.1, p < .0001). Three
subjects experienced two diagnosed concussions over the course of the
study and in all three cases full longitudinal post-concussion data re-
lative to the first concussion could not be acquired before they ex-
perienced a second concussion. Complete longitudinal data was ac-
quired relative to their most recent concussion. One player (#25)
experienced three concussions over a three-year period and we were
able to obtain three longitudinal follow-up datasets in this case, in-
cluding one in-season scan before they experienced their third con-
cussion.
A single subject drove components 3, 6, 7, and 9. Component 1
(t = −2.9, p = .003, Confidence Interval (CI) = [−0.023 to −0.044])
and 11 (t = 3.32, p = .001, CI = [0.033 to 0.13]) were significantly
associated with the subject's age at the time of scanning, Table B.1).
Relevant components were reproducible and correlated when re-
plicating results for different LICA model orders (Table B.2). There were
three relevant components that showed linked structure-function
changes related to concussion: components 4 and 5 had a significant
main effect for subject visit, components 5 was also significantly asso-
ciated with the number of previous concussions (t = 2.65, p = .008,
CI = [0.035 to 0.24]) and component 8 was significantly associated
with SCAT3 reported symptoms (t = −2.28, p = .024, CI = [−0.07 to
−0.005]).
3.1.2. Linked component 4: the brain's acute response to concussion
Component 4 weights were significantly different amongst the
subject visits (F = 8.13, p = .000007) and diffusion metrics dominated
(87%, Fig. 1B and Fig. 2). Post-hoc tests revealed a significant differ-
ence between off-season and 24–72 h post-concussion (p = .0002) as
well as between in- and off-season (p = .0009). 6-month post-concus-
sion data was also significantly different from acute post-concussion
data (p = .005). In-season and acute post-concussion data had sig-
nificantly lower component weights than off-season (and 6-month data
compared to acute post-concussion data only) (Fig. 3) that represent
decreased MD, AD, and increased FA acutely post-concussion and
during the in-season (specific regions shown in Fig. 2) that were asso-
ciated with subtle changes in RSN functional connectivity. MD and AD
maps overlapped with decreases acutely post-concussion focused in-
feriorly along the brainstem including bilateral corpus callosum, ante-
rior thalamic radiation, inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fas-
ciculus, and corticospinal tract, including the superior cerebellar
peduncle (Fig. 2). FA increased in some of the same areas as MD and AD
decreases. Subject #17 who notably experienced a loss of consciousness
and #20 who had a relatively early previous concussion explained
nearly 10% of the variance and once these two datasets were removed,
the main effect (and post-hoc comparisons) remained significant. An
artifact within these datasets was not evident, and their large associa-
tions with this component may be biologically relevant, i.e. related to
the specific injury severity or concussion history. These datasets were
not included in the repeated measures analysis for component 4.
3.1.3. Linked component 5: long-term alterations of brain structure-function
Component 5 was also significantly different amongst the subject
visits (F = 4.45, p = .002) and was composed of more balanced con-
tributions from all imaging metrics (Fig. 4). There were significant
differences in component 5 weight estimates between in-season and 6-
months post-concussion (p = .015). Increased component 5 weights
represent decreased MD and AD along the body and splenium of the
corpus callosum, fornix, and thalamus linked with rs-fMRI connectivity
changes (regions shown in Fig. 4). Subject #25 (concussed three times)
showed a large component weight across all her time points (including
in-season), and once this subject's data was removed the main effect and
post-hoc result remained significant. Artifacts were once again not
evident in the data and this subject's component weights may be related
to her repeated concussions. This subject's data was not included in the
repeated measures analysis of component 5.
3.1.4. Monitoring
linked
components
longitudinally
within
individual
concussed athletes
We looked at the modulation of these linked components long-
itudinally in concussed players with complete data (Table C.1, n = 9).
There was a significant repeated measures effect (p < .05) that re-
plicated our whole data average comparisons (Fig. 3b and 5b). We
could reliably see significant decreases in component 4 weights acutely
post-concussion in individual athletes compared to their specific in- or
off-season scan. Component 5 weights were consistently increased at 3-
months and/or 6-months post-concussion compared to their own most
recent pre-concussion scan.
3.1.5. Effects of clinical data and concussion history
Component 5 weights were significantly associated with the total
number of concussion reported (t = 2.65, p = .009, CI = [0.035 to
0.236]). The number of reported SCAT3 symptoms was significantly
associated
with
component
8
weights
(t = −2.38,
p = .018,
CI = [−0.07 to −0.005]) within the linear mixed effects model. MD
dominated this linked component once again focused in the fornix,
corpus callosum and thalamus, with co-varying AD, FA, DMN and ex-
ecutive RSN connectivity changes (Fig. 6).
4. Discussion
In this study, we used data-driven techniques to examine female
rugby players with and without a concussion over time. This is the first
concussion study to examine multiparametric MRI data using LICA and
allowed unbiased and reliable decomposition of the data to reveal
complex neurobiological signatures that characterized structure-func-
tion alterations both acutely and persistently post-concussion. These
linked changes of brain structure-function were related to self-reported
concussion history and consistent when following individual concussed
athletes longitudinally over time.
Rugby generally does not involve direct impacts to the head but
rather substantial and repetitive rotational accelerations of the head. A
study of amateur male rugby players reported 77 impacts exceeding
10 g acceleration per game, and higher rotational accelerations com-
pared to other previously studied cohorts like football (King et al.
2015). A recent study of female rugby players recorded an average of
14 impacts per player, per match and the majority of these were to the
side of the head (King et al. 2018). We expect that these numbers are
not substantially different for the varsity athletes studied here given the
rigorous practice schedule (4 contact practices/week) where they may
experience subconcussive (and concussive) impacts and accelerations.
We found two linked multiparametric MRI components that were
expressed differently amongst the subject visits. Component 4 was as-
sociated with acute brain changes post-concussion and during the in-
season where athletes participate in contact practices and play.
Diffusion metrics dominated this component and corresponded to de-
creased MD and AD located inferiorly in the brain involving many deep

 white matter tracts linked with rs-fMRI connectivity decreases between
cortical regions in the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes. This in-
cluded regions structurally connected by the implicated white matter
tracts as well as regions spatially near diffusion variations.
Acute decreases in MD and AD have been observed post-concussion
in multiple studies, and could reflect neuroinflammation, diffuse axonal
disruption, and/or changes in myelin content (Bazarian et al. 2007; Chu
et al. 2010; Mayer et al. 2012; Wilde et al. 2008). We observed that this
linked component recovered back to off-season levels by 3-months post-
concussion and was also not strongly associated with reorganized
functional connectivity patterns. This component may reflect an acute
neuroinflammatory response and/or a temporary disruption of in-
feriorly located white matter tracts near the brainstem. In our previous
study of younger hockey players, we also found changes in white matter
diffusion located inferiorly in the corticospinal tract within 24–72 h
post-concussion with very subtle changes in functional connectivity
(Manning et al. 2017) as well as acute neuroinflammatory blood bio-
markers (Daley et al. 2016).
In-season data had decreased diffusion compared to off-season data
(the same direction as the acute post-concussion data) and could reflect
the cumulative effect of subconcussive impacts (Abbas et al. 2015;
Slobounov et al. 2017). Previous studies support this interpretation by
relating accelerometer measures of repetitive head impacts with diffu-
sion MRI measures in non-concussed contact sport athletes (McAllister
et al. 2014). MR spectroscopy data in a subset of these rugby players
has been published previously and reported glutamine decreases within
the prefrontal white matter of both non-concussed and concussed rugby
players (Schranz et al. 2017). Given the present findings, we are ac-
quiring data from age-matched varsity female rowers and swimmers
(non-contact) in order to control for the influence of high athletic ac-
tivity.

 recovery post-concussion. Decreases in diffusion along major white
matter tracts like the corpus callosum and co-varying changes in rs-
fMRI network connectivity were observed at 6-months post-concussion.
Some of these changes are consistent with previous longitudinal find-
ings of a small study of concussed female athletes (Chamard et al.
2016). A decrease in AD has been shown to correlate with damage to
the axons themselves due to rotationally accelerated stretch-injury and
the corpus callosum has been repeatedly shown to be vulnerable to
concussion (Chamard et al. 2016; Stamm et al. 2015; Sullivan et al.
2013; Wright et al. 2016). The fornix is another major white matter
structure that carries information from the hippocampus and limbic
system in general, and has been associated with memory loss and CTE
(Adnan et al. 2013; McKee et al. 2013; Thomas et al. 2011). These
linked longitudinal imaging changes represent simultaneous disruption
of white matter tracts and compensatory functional connectivity
changes that may reflect simultaneous membrane dysfunction and
physical alterations of microstructure that consequently affect func-
tional architecture. The number of concussions reported was also sig-
nificantly associated with the component weights. There may be in-
accuracies in this self-reported data and undiagnosed concussions that
the players did not seek medical attention for. However, given recent
research findings of severe CTE in young varsity athletes (Mez et al.
2017), this is an important result that requires further investigation.
Our data suggests that concussion causes long-lasting and cumulative
changes of brain microstructure and functional connectivity at 6-
months or even years after injury. Abnormalities within central and
primary white matter structures appear to be closely related to con-
cussion history and are linked with altered functional connectivity.
Using conjunction analysis approaches, we can appreciate that these
long-term post-concussion disruptions along fundamental white matter
tracts are directly linked with alterations in functional connectivity
throughout the cortex. Component 8 was significantly related to the

resting networks (DMN = default mode network) that contributed to this linked component.

 SCAT3 symptom score and involved diffusion measures in the fornix
linked with DMN and executive RSN hyperconnectivity. Functional
hyperconnectivity patterns were not exclusively evident at 3-months
post-concussion like in our previous study of younger male hockey
players (Manning et al. 2017), however prolonged decreases in MD and
AD were observed in both studies. Comparison between these two
studies is difficult due to many different factors including age, sex,
analytical approach, the use of a helmet, or sports-specific biomecha-
nical factors. Future research efforts should investigate if these brain
alterations are a precursor of neurodegenerative processes or if they can
enable more specific predictions of recovery and vulnerability to re-
injury. While this data-driven approach has a number of advantages,
there are a few subjective choices including the chosen model order and
what parameters to input into the model that are a limitation, where
other choices may render different results. In general the DTI metrics
dominated the linked components that were significantly altered
longitudinally post-concussion. We also found that components that
were dominated by a single subject's data were often a result of a
specific RSN connectivity map, perhaps indicating that the DTI metrics
are spatially more consistently altered post-concussion compared to the
resting state connectivity patterns explored here. Another limitation is
the relatively small sample size of concussed athletes and these findings
warrant further investigation and replication.
The conjunction of MRI data from this complex cohort of female
rugby players has shown that there are acute multiparametric imaging
changes following concussion. While some of these changes may reflect
acute neuroinflammatory disruptions that recover quickly along with
symptoms, we found linked functional and white matter micro-
structural changes that remained altered 6-months after the concussion
- well beyond clinical recovery and clearance to return to play. Linked
imaging components related to individual concussion history where
currently healthy subjects with more previous concussions were related
to decreases in AD within the fornix and corpus callosum linked with
both structurally connected and distal cortical connectivity changes.
Though some components related to clinical scores, the associated long-
term clinical implication of these observations remains an open ques-
tion. However, given the growing literature and the findings reported
here, it is clear that concussions are related to underlying white matter
microstructural and linked functional connectivity changes that persist
well beyond symptomatic recovery.
