abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric hypertension predisposes children to adult 
hypertension and early markers of cardiovascular disease. No large-scale studies have 
examined diagnosis and initial medication management of pediatric hypertension 
and prehypertension. The objective of this study was to evaluate diagnosis and initial 
medication management of pediatric hypertension and prehypertension in primary care.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study aggregating electronic health record data on >1.2 
million pediatric patients from 196 ambulatory clinics across 27 states. Demographic, 
diagnosis, blood pressure (BP), height, weight, and medication prescription data extracted. 
Main outcome measures include proportion of pediatric patients with ≥3 visits with 
abnormal BPs, documented hypertension and prehypertension diagnoses, and prescribed 
antihypertensive medications. Marginal standardization via logistic regression produced 
adjusted diagnosis rates.
RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-eight thousand seventy-nine patients, ages 3 to 18, had 
≥3 visits with BP measurements (48.9% girls, 58.6% <10 years old). Of these, 3.3% met 
criteria for hypertension and 10.1% for prehypertension. Among practices with ≥50 eligible 
patients, 2813 of 12 138 patients with hypertension (23.2%; 95% confidence interval, 
18.2%–28.2%) and 3990 of 38 874 prehypertensive patients (10.2%; 95% confidence 
interval, 8.2%–12.2%) were diagnosed. Age, weight, height, sex, and number and magnitude 
of abnormal BPs were associated with diagnosis rates. Of 2813 diagnosed, persistently 
hypertensive patients, 158 (5.6%) were prescribed antihypertensive medication within 
12 months of diagnosis (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptive 
blockers [35%], diuretics [22%], calcium channel blockers [17%], and β-blockers [10%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension and prehypertension were infrequently diagnosed among 
pediatric patients. Guidelines for diagnosis and initial medication management of abnormal 
BP in pediatric patients are not routinely followed.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Pediatric hypertension or 
prehypertension is known to be underdiagnosed from small 
studies. No studies show whether guideline-based medication 
treatment is initiated for pediatric patients with hypertension or 
how antihypertensive medications are used among these patients.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study confi
 rms widespread 
underdiagnosis of pediatric hypertension and prehypertension 
among 400 000 pediatric patients seen in primary care settings 
across the United States. For the fi
 rst time ever we report on 
antihypertensive medication initiation and use in hypertensive 
patients.

Pediatric hypertension has an 
estimated prevalence of 2% to 
5% among children, is 1 of the 10 
most common chronic diseases in 
childhood, 
 
1 
 
 
–5 predisposes children 
to adult hypertension, and is 
associated with early markers of 
cardiovascular disease. 
6 
 
 
 
– 
12 Given the 
estimated several million children 
and adolecents with abnormal 
blood pressure (BP) throughout 
the United States and potential 
long-term health risks, 
 
13 timely 
recognition of pediatric hypertension 
and treatment, with safe and 
effective medications, is needed to 
reduce long-term morbidity and 
mortality. 
12, 
14, 
 
15 In previous research 
at a single institution among almost 
15 000 patients, clinicians failed to 
recognize 76% of cases of pediatric 
hypertension, suggesting the 
possibility of 1.5 million undiagnosed 
cases in the United States. 
16
Lack of diagnosis prevents the 
initiation of guideline-based 
treatments, including lifestyle 
modification and medication. 
14 
Antihypertensive medication 
treatment is specifically recommended 
for children and adolescents with 
symptomatic stage 1 hypertension or 
those who have persistently abnormal 
BP after 3 to 6 months without 
pharmacological intervention, and for 
all children and adolescents with stage 
2 hypertension. 
14 This study seeks to 
determine the extent to which national 
guidelines regarding the diagnosis and 
initial pharmacological management 
of pediatric hypertension are being 
followed in a large number of diverse 
primary care practices caring for 
children and adolescents.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
The participating clinicians, sites, and 
patients in this retrospective cohort 
study were part of the Comparative 
Effectiveness Research Through 
Collaborative Electronic Reporting 
(CER2) Consortium, coordinated 
by the American Academic of 
Pediatrics. 
17 The network consists of 
7 health care organizations, including 
196 pediatric primary care sites 
across 27 states, representing >2000 
pediatric primary care clinicians 
(pediatricians, family physicians, 
internist-pediatricians, physician 
assistants, and pediatric and family 
medicine nurse practitioners) 
and >1.2 million children. To 
participate, study sites had to be 
using an electronic health record 
(EHR) for the period in which they 
submitted data. Organizations and 
sites used different EHRs. We did not 
investigate the details of EHR tools 
and functions or other strategies that 
might have been in place to aid in 
the recognition and/or management 
of pediatric hypertension or 
prehypertension, although we know 
that some EHR tools and functions 
were in place at certain sites in the 
latter part of the 15-year study period.
Patients
This study included children and 
adolescents between 3 and 18 years of 
age. Included subjects were primary 
care patients with ≥3 visits, each 
with BP and height measurements, 
between 1999 and 2014. Age criteria 
were selected according to the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute’s National High Blood 
Pressure Education Program Working 
Group on High Blood Pressure in 
Children and Adolescents fourth 
report on the diagnosis, evaluation, 
and treatment of high BP in children 
and adolescents (“the fourth report”) 
recommendations for routine BP 
screening. 
14 The average time period 
over which the ≥3 visits occurred was 
62 months (range 0.3–173 months).
Data Collection
Data from the study sites’ EHRs were 
extracted and standardized according 
to the Observational Medical 
Outcomes Partnership Common Data 
Model Version 4.0. 
17, 
 
18 Data elements 
used included vital signs (BP, 
height, and weight), visit diagnoses 
(International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] 
codes), and prescriptions recorded 
in the EHRs, as well as race and 
ethnicity, insurance, age, and sex. 
We identified and excluded outlying 
height and weight measurements by 
using a validated algorithm based 
on exponentially weighted moving 
averages of growth measurements. 
19 
Within a given site, EHR data were 
included only if BP, height, diagnosis 
codes, and prescriptions all were 
captured in a given year. If any of 
these were not recorded, then all 
data for that practice for that year 
were excluded. Less than 10% of all 
observations were excluded based on 
outlier and incomplete data criteria. 
Race or ethnicity was available on 
only 74.1% of patients and insurance 
data on 69.8% of patients, because 
these data were not routinely 
captured in some practice sites. 
Standard clinical BP measurement 
protocols were in place at each site.
Antihypertensive medication 
prescriptions were classified as 
β-blockers, diuretics, calcium 
channel blockers, renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system (RAAS) 
blocking agents, and other. “Other” 
antihypertensive medications included 
peripheral α-antagonist, vasodilators, 
and α-agonists. Combination drugs 
were counted toward each of their 
contributing drug classes. Although 
prescription data came from primary 
care provider practices’ EHRs, the use 
of medication reconciliation processes 
in primary care sites should include 
entering medications prescribed by 
other providers involved in the care 
of the patient (eg, specialists), if they 
were not already part of the primary 
care practices’ EHRs.

Disease Control and Prevention 
growth chart algorithms. 
20 Age, 
sex, and height-adjusted systolic 
and diastolic BP percentiles were 
calculated based on published 
formulas. 
14 Prehypertension was 
defined as ≥3 systolic and/or 
diastolic BP measurements ≥90th 
and <95th percentiles for sex, age, 
and height percentile or >120/80 
mm Hg. 
14 Stage 1 hypertension 
was defined as ≥3 systolic and/or 
diastolic BP measurements ≥95th 
percentile and <99th percentile +5 
mm Hg. 
14 Stage 2 hypertension was 
defined as systolic and/or diastolic 
BP measurements ≥99th percentile 
+5 mm Hg.14 In the rare circumstance 
that a patient had ≥3 systolic and/or 
diastolic BP measures in >1 abnormal 
BP category, they were counted in 
the most severe category. Diagnosis 
of prehypertension or hypertension 
was defined as an abnormal BP–
related diagnosis listed on or after 
the date of the first abnormal systolic 
and/or diastolic BP. ICD-9 codes 
for recognized prehypertension 
or hypertension included elevated 
BP without hypertension (code 
796.2); hypertension (code 401.xx); 
hypertension, not otherwise specified 
(code 401.9); hypertension, benign 
(code 401.1); and hypertension 
(code 997.91) or heart disease due to 
hypertension, not otherwise specified 
(code 402.9).
Statistical Analysis
Confidence intervals (CIs) for overall 
rates accounted for the clustered 
sampling (patients within practice 
sites) and reflect the variability of 
those rates across sites. Standardized 
proportions (percentages) of 
patients with hypertension and 
prehypertension diagnoses were 
estimated via logistic regression, with 
hypertension or prehypertension 
as the outcome. 
21 Covariates for 
standardization included sex, age 
(3–9, 10–14, and 15–18 years), 
weight (normal, overweight, and 
obese by BMI percentiles), height 
(designated as “not tall” and “tall, 
” 
because patients who resemble 
adults in stature may be more 
likely to have their hypertension 
or prehypertension recognized), 
sex (male or female), number of 
abnormal BP readings beyond the 3 
needed for diagnosis, and number 
of stage 2 BP readings, all of which 
were specified a priori. Because 
we hypothesized that patients 
who resembled adults in stature 
may be more likely to have their 
hypertension or prehypertension 
recognized, “not tall” was defined as 
height less than the median heights 
for 18-year-old boys and girls in 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention Growth Chart, 
 
20 and 
“tall” was greater than or equal to 
these heights. Data on patient race or 
ethnicity and health insurance were 
commonly missing, and because we 
could not conduct formal imputation 
of missing data because missingness 
varied by site, we performed no 
analyses that involved race and 
ethnicity or health insurance.
To complete multivariable analysis of 
associations of patient-level factors 
and diagnosis while controlling for 
possible confounding effects of site, 
sparse data made the elimination of 
small sites necessary. 
22 
– 
24 Therefore, 
we restricted analyses to practice 
sites with ≥50 hypertensive or 
prehypertensive children. To evaluate 
the extent of variation in the treatment 
of hypertension across sites, we fit 2 
models that included age (categorized) 
as a covariate and practice site 
as a random effect, by using 2 
approaches: adaptive quadrature (16 
integration points), as implemented 
in Stata version 14 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX), 
 
25 and integrated 
nested Laplace approximations26 as 
implemented in R version 3.1.2 (The 
R Project for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria). 
27
The Institution Review Board 
(IRB) at the American Academy of 
Pediatrics approved this study and 
the IRB at the Children’s Hospital 
of Philadelphia determined that 
this study was not human subjects 
research. Additional local IRBs also 
reviewed and approved this study.
RESULTS
From the ≤15-year study period 
at some sites and from a total 
population of >1.2 million pediatric 
patients, 398 079 patients were 
between 3 and 18 years of age and 
had ≥3 visits with BPs and heights 
measured over 3 032 430 visits. 
From this eligible population, 13 080 
children (3.3%) met criteria for 
hypertension and 40 076 (10.1%) 
for prehypertension. After smaller 
practice sites were dropped to 
allow multivariable modeling, the 
sample included 12 138 children 
in 44 sites with hypertension and 
38 874 children in 77 sites with 
prehypertension ( 
Table 1,  
Fig 1).
Hypertension Underdiagnosis 
Analysis
Among the 12 138 children with 
hypertension, 2813 (23.2%; 95% CI, 
18.2%–28.2%) had an EHR diagnosis 
of hypertension or abnormal BP. 
Of the 4996 children with stage 2 
hypertension, 1612 (32.4%; 95% 
CI, 26.6%–38.3%) had a diagnosis. 
Children who were older, heavier, 
tall, or male, who had ≥1 BP 
measurement in the stage 2 BP range, 
or who had additional readings 
beyond the 3 needed for diagnosis 
were more likely to be diagnosed 
with hypertension ( 
Table 2).
Prehypertension Underdiagnosis 
Analysis
Among the 38 874 children with 
prehypertension, 3990 (10.3%; 
95% CI, 8.2%–12.2%) had an 
EHR diagnosis of hypertension or 
abnormal BP. Children who were 
older, heavier, tall, or male, who had 
≥1 BP in the stage 2 BP range, or 
who had additional readings beyond 
the 3 needed for diagnosis were 
more likely to be diagnosed with 
prehypertension ( 
Table 3).

Antihypertensive Medication 
Analysis Among Hypertensive 
Patients
Among children with diagnosed 
hypertension and who continued to 
have high blood pressure readings 
(n = 2813), 158 (5.6%; 95% CI, 
4.5%–6.7%) were treated with 
antihypertensive medicine within 
12 months of diagnosis. Stage 2 
hypertension (5.8% vs 3.2%), but not 
age, sex, or BMI percentile, increased 
the chances of an antihypertensive 
medication prescription. The most 
common antihypertensive medication 
categories were RAAS inhibitors 
(angiotensin-converting-enzyme 
inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor 
blockers) (35% of children), followed 
by diuretics (22%), calcium channel 
blockers (17%), and β-blockers (10%) 
( 
Fig 2). The average age of the first 
prescription was 13.7 years. Variation 
across sites in medication initiation 
achieved statistical significance 
(P = .029); however only 1 site had 
much higher treatment rate (15% 
[13/85]) than others.
DISCUSSION
This study documents the 
underdiagnosis of pediatric 
hypertension and prehypertension 
and the medication undertreatment 
of pediatric hypertension in a sample 
of pediatric primary care practice 
sites caring for almost 2% of the 
pediatric population across the 
United States. The 3.3% prevalence 
of hypertension is consistent with 
pediatric hypertension studies 
measuring multiple blood pressures 
over multiple visits, documenting 
prevalence ranging from 2% to 
5%. 
1 
 
 
–5 The low diagnosis rate 
(24%) is consistent with a smaller 
study from 1 health system. 
16 Some 
underdiagnosis may be explained by 
the fact that identifying hypertensive 
children is complicated by the 
variation in normal BP ranges across 
sex, height percentile, and age, with 
hundreds of abnormal BP threshold 
values for pediatric patients. 
14 When 
abnormal BP identification becomes 
a core functionality in pediatric 
EHRs, 
 
28 recognition of abnormal 
BPs and hypertension or 
prehypertension may improve. 
29
Several factors were associated 
with higher rates of hypertension or 
prehypertension diagnosis. Children 
who were overweight or obese, male, 
or tall or who had a greater number 
of or higher abnormal BPs were

The more abnormal the value and the 
more frequent the abnormal value, 
the more likely pediatric providers 
were to recognize the disease. In 
addition, if a child is overweight 
or obese, the pediatric provider 
may be more likely to look for and 
recognize existing hypertension 
or prehypertension, which could 
be ameliorated by weight loss. The 
difference in rates of diagnosis by

to have higher BP, which similarly 
may lead to increased diagnosis.
Because of the large number of 
children in our cohort and because 
we followed patients over time, we 
were able to assess the initiation 
of antihypertension medication 
treatment. Because of the low rates 
of disease, large samples are essential 
to study factors associated with 
diagnosis and treatment. Unlike 
hypertension guidelines for adults that 
recommend the initiation of particular 
antihypertensive medications for 
specific clinical indications, pediatric 
hypertension guidelines generally 
do not specify any antihypertensive 
medication initiation hierarchy. 
14, 
 
31
Current guidelines state that children 
with stage 2 hypertension or 
symptomatic stage 1 hypertension 
should be started on antihypertensive 
medication at the time of diagnosis, 
and children with asymptomatic stage 
1 hypertension should be started 
on antihypertensive medication if 
their hypertension persists after 3 to 
6 months without pharmacological 
intervention. 
14 Therefore, all 
children with hypertension should 
be prescribed antihypertensive 
medications at diagnosis or at least 
within 6 months of diagnosis with 
persistently abnormal BP. In this 
study, children were given 12 months 
in which to initiate medication. 
Patients with stage 2 hypertension 
were more likely to be prescribed 
antihypertensive medications than 
those with stage 1, although the 2% 
absolute increase in prescribing 
was small. The finding that only 
1 in 20 children with diagnosed, 
persistent hypertension for ≥1 year 
were prescribed antihypertensive 
medication indicates poor compliance 
with current pediatric hypertension 
guidelines recommending 
pharmacological treatment if no 
improvement occurs at least within 3 
to 6 months. 
14
RAAS blockers were the most 
common antihypertensive 
medications prescribed. This finding 
was surprising because these agents 
are teratogenic and were prescribed 
in a substantial number of adolescent 
girls. Diuretics, recommended for 
first-line treatment in adults, 
 
32 
were the second most commonly 
initiated drug class, consistent with 
their low side effect profile. Calcium 
channel blockers were the third 
most commonly prescribed drug 
class, analogous to their secondary 
or tertiary recommended use in 
adults. 
32 β-blockers were the fourth 
most commonly prescribed drug 
class, consistent with their relative 
contraindication in overweight 
and obese children, where exercise 
would be an additional treatment 
management strategy. In addition, 
16% of the children were prescribed 
“other” antihypertensives, 
including peripheral α-antagonists, 
vasodilators, and α-agonists.
This study demonstrates both 
the limitations and the power of 
pooling EHR data from multiple, 
disparate health care systems and 
clinicians using different EHRs 
to create “big data” for research. 
Particularly in pediatrics, EHRs, 
as demonstrated here, show great 
potential to investigate questions in 
uncommon conditions or conditions 
with infrequent treatment. More 
than 1.2 million original patients 
were needed initially to address 
the ultimate question of which 
antihypertensive medications were 
commonly prescribed in less then 
175 patients. However, pooling EHR 
data across systems with different 
EHRs is challenging because of a lack 
of data standards and data collection 
inconsistencies. 
17, 
 
33, 
 
34 For example, 
race or ethnicity and insurance 
information existed for only ~70% 
of our final eligible population, 
and several sites did not collect or 
preserve data on these important

factors. Although race or ethnicity and 
insurance were not included in our 
analysis, imputation methods that use 
direct patient identifiers (name and 
address) are available for critical race 
and ethnicity analyses. 
35 We lacked 
name and address in the limited 
data set used. As EHR incentives to 
promote data collection and adoption 
continue to expand, these limitations 
should decrease.33, 
 
36, 
 
37 The usefulness 
of pooled EHR data for research, 
especially in smaller subpopulations, 
should increase with broader EHR use, 
growing ease of EHR data extraction, 
and the modest additional cost to 
support EHR-based observational 
research.
This study had several limitations. 
It relied on entered ICD-9 codes as 
the gold standard for the positive 
identification by a provider of a 
child or adolescent with abnormal 
BPs. However, given that manual 
chart review of a subset of EHR 
records showed <10% with only 
text notations of an abnormal BP, 
this limitation is unlikely to have 
substantially influenced our overall 
findings. Also, we relied on standard 
clinical (nonresearch), in-office BP 
measurements recorded in the EHR 
and included all reasons (preventive 
care and nonpreventive care) for 
visits to primary care pediatric 
providers. These limitations have the 
potential to inappropriately identify 
hypertension (eg, abnormal BPs 
due to inaccurate measures, pain, or 
white-coat hypertension). However, 
the overall prevalence of pediatric 
hypertension in this study (3.3%) 
is consistent with other studies 
specifically designed to measure the 
prevalence of chronic hypertension. 
1 
 
 
–5 
We relied on the August 2004 
definitions of hypertension and 
prehypertension, although some 
visits and BPs occurred before then. 
However, only 11% of BPs in the 
hypertension or prehypertension 
range, and 8.4% of all available BPs, 
were from before August 2004. And if 
a pediatric provider identified a post–
August 2004 abnormal BP, the normal 
process should have been to evaluate 
or reevaluate pre–August 2004 BPs 
in the EHR against post–August 2004 
criteria. Therefore, we do not expect 
pre–August 2004 visits or BPs to have 
had any significant impact on our 
findings.
Additionally, we relied on 
EHRs to identify prescribing of 
antihypertensive medications. All sites 
were using computerized physician 
order entry in their EHRs for the 
years included for analysis. Our 
results might be biased toward the 
underdiagnosis of hypertension and 
its undertreatment if children treated 
by specialists did not have their 
medications abstracted in the EHR 
or did not share the same EHRs as 
the pediatric primary care clinicians. 
However, the standard of care is that 
pediatric primary care clinicians 
should maintain a complete diagnosis 
and medication record of all diagnoses 
and medications that a patient takes, 
not just the ones they are actively 
managing. The fact that at least some 
of the EHRs in our sites provided 
decision support for identification 
and management of pediatric 
prehypertension or hypertension 
during the study period means that 
this study may actually overreport 
the diagnosis of hypertension or 
prehypertension compared with 
primary care pediatric provider sites 
without advanced EHRs. Of the >1.2 
million patients seen at the primary 
care pediatric provider sites in the 
CER2 network, >50% of patients were 
excluded because they did not have 
≥3 visits during the study period. 
We lack data on the diagnosis and 
medication treatment of pediatric 
hypertension in these patients. 
Missing data on race or ethnicity 
and insurance precluded formal 
imputation and reliable analysis of 
these secondary factors. Finally, BP 
measurements followed routine 
clinical procedures, as opposed to 
more rigorous measurement methods. 
It is impossible to know how well 
standard clinical procedures were 
followed, what percentage of the BPs 
obtained from EHRs were repeated, 
or the method used to obtain the BP 
(automated or manual). However, the 
EHR BPs obtained were the ones in 
the legal medical record. In addition, 
the fact that the overall prevalence of 
hypertension is in the range identified 
through more rigorous methods is 
reassuring.
CONCLUSIONS
Hypertension and prehypertension, 
well-defined, prevalent, and 
generally asymptomatic conditions 
in children and adolescents, are often 
undiagnosed and untreated with 
medications. Because appropriate 
diagnosis and guideline-based 
medication management are 
important for effective treatment, 
intervention is needed to help 
pediatric primary care clinicians 
recognize and treat hypertension and 
prehypertention. The description 
of antihypertensive medication 
treatment could not have been 
accomplished without the large initial 
cohort, demonstrating the power of 
pooling EHR data across practice sites.
