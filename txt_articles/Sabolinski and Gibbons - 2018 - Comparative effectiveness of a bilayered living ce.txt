Aim: To compare the effectiveness of bilayered living cellular construct (BLCC) and an acellular fetal bovine
collagen dressing (FBCD) for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. Methods: Data from WoundExpert
R
� (Net
Health, PA, USA) was used to analyze 1021 refractory venous leg ulcers treated at 177 facilities. Results:
Kaplan–Meier analyses showed that BLCC (893 wounds) was superior to FBCD (128 wounds), p = 0.01 for:
wound closure by weeks 12 (31 vs 25%), 24 (55 vs 43%) and 36 (68 vs 53%); reduction in time to wound
closure of 37%, (19 vs 30 weeks); and improvement in the probability of healing by 45%. Conclusion: BLC
versus FBCD showed significant differences in both time to and frequency of healing suggesting that BLCC
may provide significant cost savings compared with FBCD.

Venous leg ulcers (VLUs), also referred to as venous stasis ulcers, are the most common type of chronic leg wound.
These often painful wounds represent the majority of leg ulcers [1–3]. VLUs have a prevalence estimated at 1% of
adults [4,5], with rates even higher among the elderly (1.7% prevalence, annually) [6]. The annual direct financial
cost to US payers for the treatment of chronic VLUs has been estimated to be US$15 billion [7].
The standard treatment for VLUs is compression therapy. However, with standard care alone, research has shown
that up to 75% of patients fail to achieve healing with the use of standard compression therapy [8]. Up to 50%
of VLUs remain unhealed at 6 months, 20% at 2 years and approximately 8% at 5 years [9]. Advanced treatment
options, such as skin substitutes, have been demonstrated to show safety and effectiveness as adjunctive therapies
to accelerate the wound healing process in nonhealing VLUs [10,11]. Treatment algorithms for initiating advanced
therapies in VLUs have not been definitively established. Such therapies, however, may be appropriate to use as
part of the initial treatment regimen in patients with poor prognostic indicators such as an ulcer size ≥10 cm2 and
an ulcer that has been present ≥12 months [12]. Data also suggest that advanced therapies should be considered in
VLUs that have not reduced in surface area by at least 40% following 4 weeks of good standard wound care with
compression therapy [13].
A bilayered living cellular construct (BLCC; Apligraf, Organogenesis, Inc., MA, USA) is at present the only
product that has undergone premarket review and is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of VLUs (premarket
approval (PMA)-approved Class III medical device). BLCC is comprised of human neonatal keratinocytes and
fibroblasts in an extracellular matrix (bovine collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins) and has been in
clinical use for the treatment of VLUs since 1998. In order to gain FDA approval for the treatment of VLUs, BLCC
was evaluated in a pivotal randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a sample size of 275 patients that showed, when
used in conjunction with compression therapy, BLCC significantly increased the percentage of patients healed

by 6 months and reduced the median time to complete wound closure when compared with an active control
(standard compression therapy) [10].
Fetal bovine collagen dressing (FBCD; Primatrix; Integra, NJ, USA) has been cleared by FDA as a 510(k) Class
II device for the management of VLUs and other skin wounds with the exception of third degree burns. FBCD
is an animal-derived acellular collagen dressing that has been processed and treated to remove cellular elements,
lipids, carbohydrates and noncollagenous proteins, resulting in a scaffold with physiological amounts of collagen
but without viable cells. Retrospective comparison of diabetic foot ulcer and venous stasis ulcer healing outcomes
(n = 40) between FBCD and BLCC showed that both treatments were highly effective; however, the FBCD-treated
wounds healed faster than patients treated with BLCC [14]. FBCD in the published retrospective analysis [14] was
demonstrated to be successfully incorporated into standard of care therapy as a primary wound covering for the
treatment of VLUs.
BLCC has not been compared with FBCD in comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies in real-world
treatment settings. Effective treatment, established in CER studies, is the extent to which an intervention produces
its intended effect in routine care conditions (real-world situations). RCTs with positive results, on the other
hand, provide evidence of efficacious treatment in controlled, highly constrained conditions that are optimal for
obtaining favorable results [15]. Thus, it is important to determine if efficacy reported from the results of RCTs can
be translated to everyday, routine practice settings (effectiveness) to support evidence-based practice.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the comparative effectiveness of BLCC to FBCD for the treatment
of VLUs in real-world settings using data over a 2-year period from a large wound care-specific electronic medical
record (EMR) database (WoundExpert R
�, Net Health, PA, USA) that is utilized by approximately 20,000 physicians
in over 1000 wound care facilities across the USA.
Methods
Study design
This study is a retrospective analysis to compare the effectiveness of BLCC and FBCD for the treatment of VLUs
using de-identified EMRs from wound care facilities across the USA in a 2-year period. The primary analyses were
median time to and frequency of wound closure evaluated up to 36 months. Wound areas (cm2) were calculated
from wound measurements of length and width. The final visit denoting VLU closure was not always recorded;
thus, wound closure was defined as an ulcer achieving an area between 0 and 0.25 cm2.
Patients
Patients eligible for inclusion were those documented as receiving at least one treatment of either BLCC or FBCD
on a partial or full thickness venous ulcer with the location coded as ankle, lower leg, shin, pretibial or calf. Included
baseline wound areas were 1–40 cm2 with ulcer duration of longer than 1 month prior to first treatment with BLCC
or FBCS. To ensure that analyses were restricted to refractory VLUs, no ulcers were included that achieved >40%
closure within the 4 weeks prior to first treatment with BLCC or FBCD. Wounds without baseline or follow-up area
measurements were excluded as well as those where the date of BLCC or FBCD treatment was unknown. Wounds
were also excluded if they received skin substitute treatments (Apligraf, Primatrix, Dermagraft, Epifix, Theraskin,
Grafix, Graftjacket) on or within 28 days of the first treatment with BLCC or FBCD. Censoring occurred for
nonhealed wounds at their last visit with an area measurement. Patients were also censored at the visit where the
alternate product was applied (either BLCC or FBCD). Wounds treated with the same product >183 days after the
prior application were censored at the visit where the subsequent application occurred. Other concurrent treatments
such as hyperbaric oxygen or negative pressure wound therapy were allowed as this was a real-world study of wound
care clinical practice not governed by a standardized, single protocol as in RCTs.
Data collection
Data were obtained from the WoundExpert EMR, which was de-identified under the terms and conditions of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Net Health provided all treatment records
for any patient receiving at least one application of BLCC or FBCD from January 2015 to January 2017 from 177
centers with contracted agreements for the transfer of de-identified data for research purposes. Treatment records
included patient baseline demographics including age (years, ≤89 per HIPAA), sex, race, wound size and duration,
and wound-specific information recorded at each visit including area measurements and treatments.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive data are expressed as mean (standard deviation) and median for continuous variables and n (%) for
categorical variables. The level of p < 0.05 was established for the purpose of defining statistical significance.
Baseline characteristics were reported as observational data for both continuous and categorical variables. Missing
covariates were imputed with the mean value of the treatment group. The primary analyses comparing incidence
of and median time to wound closure were determined by Kaplan–Meier analysis with a two-tailed log-rank test.
The last observation was carried forward for missing data. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used
to estimate the percentage of VLUs with closure at weeks 12, 24 and 36. Median time to wound closure was
determined by the Cox proportional hazards regression survivor function. The frequency of wounds closed at week
12, 24 and 36, and median time to wound closure, hazard ratio with 95% CI and p-value were estimated from the
Cox model with terms for treatment, baseline wound area, baseline wound duration, baseline wound depth, sex,
BMI and patient age at first treatment.
Results
All VLUs that received their first treatment with BLCC or FBCD from January 2015 and January 2017 at all
participating Net Health centers were eligible for inclusion. A total of 927 patients with 1021 refractory wounds
met the eligibility requirements for inclusion in the analysis. Eight hundred and ninety-three wounds (805 patients)
were treated with BLCC, and 128 wounds (122 patients) were treated with FBCD.
Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1, and baseline wound and treatment characteristics are shown
in Table 2. Treatment groups were similar with respect to age, sex, BMI and number of wounds per patient. The
median age was 70 years old in both groups. Women represented a little more than half of the population in the
BLCC group while men represented greater than half of the population in the FBCD group, and the median BMI
was comparable between groups (31.5 kg/m2 in the BLCC group and 30.6 kg/m2 in the FBCD group). Groups
were comparable for the percentage of patients presenting with a single wound (65.7 vs 71.3% for BLCC and
FBCD, respectively) as well as patients presenting with multiple wounds at baseline (34.3 vs 28.7% for BLCC
and FBCD, respectively). Though some nominal differences were observed, the BLCC and FBCD treated wounds
were similar for baseline wound area, depth and duration (Table 2). At the first treatment application, the mean
wound area was 10.1 cm2 in the BLCC group and 10.6 cm2 in the FBCD group. The mean wound durations
in the BLCC and the FBCD groups were similar, both being >1 year (12.6 and 17.3 months in the BLCC and
FBCD treatment groups, respectively).
Treatment characteristics are also shown in Table 2. The median number of treatment applications received was
comparable for BLCC and FBCD with a mean of 2.8 ± 1.6 for BLCC and 2.1 ± 1.6 for FBCD. FBCD was
used as a single application 46.9% of the time. Multiple applications were used on 53.1% of FBCD-treated ulcers.
The percentage of patients treated with a single application with BLCC was 26.3%, and 73.7% had multiple

applications. For patients receiving multiple applications, the median interval between applications was longer with
FBCD compared with BLCC (21.0 vs 14 days). Groups were similar with regard to the number of debridements at
or within 28 days prior to or post the initial treatment application. Treatment with hyperbaric oxygen or negative
pressure wound therapy prior to or concurrent with BLCC or FBCD treatment rarely occurred (<6% of wounds
treated) and comparable between groups (Table 2).
After adjusting for treatment, treatment characteristics, baseline wound area, baseline wound duration, baseline
wound depth, sex, BMI and patient age at first treatment application, Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that
BLCC treatment significantly improved the median time to VLU wound closure by 37%, achieving the end point
11 weeks sooner than FBCD-treated patients (19 weeks for BLCC vs 30 weeks for FBCD; p = 0.01) (Figure 1).
The estimated incidence of wound closure for BLCC compared with FBCD was significantly improved by week 12
(31.0 vs 25.0%), week 24 (55.0 vs 43%) and week 36 (68 vs 53%); p = 0.01 (Figure 2). BLCC treatment increased
the probability of wound closure compared with FBCD by 45% showing a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.45 (95% CI:
1.08, 1.94), p = 0.01.
Discussion
This is the first comparative effectiveness study to evaluate BLCC and FDCD for the treatment of VLUs. The
ulcers in the patient population evaluated were refractory or nonhealing with routine care. Ulcers in both study
groups showed a duration of >1 year, failed to achieve ≥40% wound closure in 4 weeks prior to the first treatment
application, and had a mean size of >10 cm2 at baseline, all negative risk factors for healing [11,13,16,17]. That the
wounds in this analysis were required to have closed by <40% prior to treatment with either BLCC or FBCD is

adopted to identify patients who may benefit from advanced wound care therapy, including skin substitutes. In
this retrospective CER study analysis, BLCC demonstrated wound closure at significantly higher frequencies and
in significantly less time compared with FBCD. BLCC increased the probability of wound closure by 45% over
the 36 weeks of observation.

In order to address the potential impact of sex, age and BMI as individual patient characteristics on comparative
clinical outcomes of BLCC and FBCD, three additional Cox analyses were performed. When treatment was
adjusted for: sex as a categorical variable, HR = 1.42 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.91); p = 0.02; age as a continuous variable,
HR = 1.44 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.93); p = 0.02; and BMI as a continuous variable, HR = 1.42 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.91);
p = 0.02. These data are consistent with the outcomes reported in our primary Cox analysis when terms for
treatment, treatment characteristics, baseline wound area, baseline wound duration, baseline wound depth, sex,
BMI and patient age at first treatment are all included (HR = 1.45 [95% CI: 1.08, 1.94]; p = 0.01). These data
would appear to indicate that the comparative effectiveness outcomes of BLCC and FBCD are minimally affected
by sex, age and BMI when these patient characteristics are considered in isolation from multivariate wound and
treatment characteristics.
Efficacy reflects the degree to which an intervention produces the expected result under the carefully controlled
conditions of a clinical research protocol. RCTs provide the best method for establishing efficacy and are considered
to have high ‘internal validity’ because of randomization, careful selection of participants and standardized treatment
practices proscribed by the clinical protocol [18,19]. The conditions of an RCT are intended to maximize the
probability of showing differences between treatment groups if they exist. RCTs act as the basis of FDA premarket
review (New Drug Applications [NDAs], Biologics License Applications [BLAs], and PMAs) of clinical evidence
for the approval of drugs, biologics and Class III devices. For guideline therapy, RCTs are generally considered level
1 evidence and the ‘gold standard’ in determining if a product can actually work. However, RCTs have limitations.
The generalizability or ‘external validity’ of data generated may be problematic if RCT data alone are interpreted in
the absence of real-world data [20]. The strict criteria for patient inclusion (which may exclude ‘higher risk’ patients),
rigorous monitoring and adherence to treatment protocols may create an environment not reflective of clinical
practice conditions in the community at large, and patients treated in RCTs may not truly represent typical patient
populations treated where these products are utilized [21]. CER studies do not narrowly select patient populations
but rather reflect interventions as typically used in practice without forced standardization. CER analyses may
therefore be interpreted as more widely applicable and complementary to RCTs since CERs evaluate treatments in
ordinary settings and in broader populations [22].
In effectiveness studies, performance is often reduced in less homogeneous populations treated outside of expert
clinical research centers and in a less rigorous fashion. Thus, it is important to determine if efficacy can be translated
to routine practice settings. Although strict comparisons between RCTs and the results presented here cannot be
made because of differences in study design and patient populations, we found the incidence of complete wound
closure for the 146 BLCC-treated patients in the pivotal RCT was 63% at week 24. These data correlated well
with the wound closure rates of 55 and 68% at weeks 24 and 36, respectively in this CER analysis [10]. To date,
there has not been a prospective RCT reporting the results of FBCD versus standard of care compression therapy
in VLUs to allow for a comparison with the outcomes demonstrated in this CER study.
VLUs have been estimated to affect approximately 2.5 million patients in the USA [23,24]. The economic burden
of VLUs on the US healthcare system in an analysis of 81,000 chronic VLU patients [7,25] was determined to be
approximately US$18 billion annually in direct costs. Medicare VLU patients receiving skin substitutes analyzed
over the same time period showed total healthcare costs were US$537 per week higher for patients who were
still incurring VLU-related costs (‘nonhealed’ ulcers) compared with those no longer incurring VLU-related costs
(‘healed’ ulcers). Of this amount, US$377 per week were for selected services considered directly related to VLU
treatment [7]. Therefore the 11-week difference in median time to wound closure (19 weeks for BLCC vs 30 weeks
for FBCD) in the current analysis could result in estimated cost savings of between US$4100 and US$5900 per
patient based on the differences in median time of having an open ulcer. This estimate likely understates the
overall economic burden of nonhealing VLUs as it does not include 20% of the total costs of care not covered by
Medicare. Analyses of two deidentified insurance claims databases showed that VLU treatment costs were directly
proportional to the frequency of and time to healing. Medicare patients with nonhealed VLUs had 78% more
hospitalization days, 50% more emergency department visits, 27% more outpatient office visits and 60% more
days of home healthcare [7]. Important indirect costs not factored in must also be taken into consideration. These
indirect costs include those associated with quality of life and lost productivity because of patient and caregiver
missed days of work. Further specifics on relative costs would require a database with more detailed information
than was available for this analysis.
We recognize that this study design analyzing real-world data, like all retrospective analyses, introduces ‘noise’ into
the study environment that typical prospective RCTs minimize. A limitation of this study is that EMR databases

often are not developed for research purposes, and variability in recording practices of individual clinics exists. Even
with the WoundExpert EMR data collection system, uniform data reporting is not monitored. Although certain
fields within the WoundExpert EMR were reliably and consistently completed (such as wound measurements),
information regarding the type of secondary dressings was found to be less consistently reported and often entered
as ‘free text’ making reliable analyses problematic. Completion of some baseline patient information fields such as
medical history, prior surgical interventions or concomitant medications, varied across centers. Additionally, the
reporting of all safety-related outcomes, adverse events or ulcer recurrences were not possible as this information
was not uniformly captured. Finally, given the lack of randomization, there is a possibility of bias in selection of
patients for BLCC or FBCD at the centers involved in patient care. However, given the large number of wounds
and centers providing information for the analysis, it is less likely that a uniform bias was present that affected
the study results. Additionally, Cox analyses used to determine wound closure outcomes adjusted for multiple
covariates and corrected for any imbalances between groups that might have arisen based on entry criteria.
There were also many advantages that the WoundExpert afforded. Because of the large sample sizes of the two
treatment groups in the Net Health database, we were able to investigate outcomes in refractory, ‘hard-to-heal’ VLUs
and excluded wounds that had reduced in size >40% in the 4 weeks prior to the first application of investigational
treatment. It is notable that percent reduction in wound size of <40% at 4 weeks from baseline has been reported
as the strongest negative predictor of nonhealing in VLUs (i.e., identifies VLUs that will not achieve wound closure
in a timely fashion) [13]. This 4-week prognostic milestone has been selectively adopted across the field of wound
care to identify patients who may benefit most from intervention with advanced therapies; however, few previous
studies have employed criteria that apply this measurement for inclusion. These results may provide important data
to help guide treatment decisions for patients with recalcitrant wounds.
Conclusion
These real-world data showed that BLCC compared with FBCD significantly improved the probability, speed, and
the incidence of wound closure in VLUs.
Summary points
• This is the first comparative effectiveness research study that compares the clinical outcomes of a bilayer living
cellular construct (BLCC) and an acellular fetal bovine collagen dressing (FBCD) for the treatment of venous leg
ulcers (VLUs) in a real-world setting.
• Treatment with BLCC significantly improves the incidence and speed of VLU wound closure compared with FBCD.
• The effectiveness of BLCC in these analyses was supportive of the efficacy results from the pivotal BLCC trial in
VLUs.
• BLCC showed a 45% greater probability of wound closure when compared with FBCD.
• BLCC demonstrated accelerated time to wound closure of 37%, an 11-week improvement compared with FBCD.
• The incidence of wound closure was superior with BLCC versus FBCD at all time points in the study.
• Improvements in the probability, speed and the incidence of wound closure in VLUs treated with BLCC suggest a
greater clinical benefit as well as a potential cost savings benefit.
• Electronic healthcare databases when used in Comparative Effectiveness Research studies offer the benefit of
providing robust sources of data in large study populations over long observation periods.
