Pediatric multiple sclerosis
Escalation and emerging treatments
ABSTRACT
Over the last 20 years, there have been significant advances in multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeu-
tics, with regulatory approval for 13 therapies in adults by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
and Food and Drug Administration. However, there is only limited approval for interferon-b and
glatiramer acetate use in children 12 years and older by the EMA. Availability of disease-
modifying therapies to children and adolescents with MS is variable by region, and is extremely
limited in some regions of the world. Up to 30% of children experience breakthrough disease
requiring therapies beyond traditional first-line agents. Recent legislation in both the United
States and Europe has mandated clinical studies for all new therapeutics applicable to children.
Several clinical trials in children are underway that will provide important information regarding
the efficacy and safety of newer drugs. This review summarizes the current knowledge of break-
through disease, escalation, and induction treatment approaches in children with MS, especially
pertaining to disease course and disability outcomes in this group of patients. In addition, ongoing
clinical trials and approaches and challenges in conducting clinical trials in the pediatric popula-
tion are discussed. Neurology® 2016;87 (Suppl 2):S103–S109

Over the last 20 years, there have been significant advances in multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeu-
tics, with regulatory approval for 13 therapies in adults by the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1 There is limited approval for interferon
(IFN)–b and glatiramer acetate (GA) use in children $12 years of age by the EMA. Safety data
for IFN–b-1a SC TIW (Rebif) for children .2 years of age is included in the European label.
Availability of disease-modifying therapies to children and adolescents with MS is variable by
region, and is extremely limited in some regions of the world. Several clinical trials in children
are underway that will bring important information regarding the efficacy and safety of newer
drugs (table 1). This review summarizes the current knowledge of breakthrough disease, esca-
lation, and induction treatment approaches in children with MS, especially pertaining to disease
course and disability outcomes in this group of patients.
CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES TO TREATING CHILDREN WITH MS No evident disease activity (NEDA). The
ultimate goal of therapy in MS is to prevent relapses and to halt disability accrual. The concept of zero disease
activity has been termed NEDA, measured by absence of clinical and MRI disease,2,3 and is increasingly being
viewed as the overall goal for treatment. However, the impact of low subclinical disease activity (e.g., rare new
lesions on MRI) on long-term MS outcome is unclear. Despite advances in MS therapeutics, no one MS
therapy has 100% efficacy on NEDA, and NEDA is achieved in approximately 50% of adult patients with MS
followed for 2 years in any therapeutic trial.4 Longitudinal data have shown that only 7% of adult patients with

 MS remain NEDA at 7 years of follow-up.4 NEDA
has not yet been systematically evaluated in children
with MS, especially since formal clinical trials in this
population have only just started, and there are
limited longitudinal datasets available to answer
this question. Although difficult to achieve on
a population or cohort level, NEDA is the ultimate
goal for individual treatment in pediatric MS.
However, given the current treatment options and
available treatment data in pediatric MS, this may be
challenging to achieve in all patients.
Individualized therapy. The identification of patients
with high and low risk for disease activity and disabil-
ity accrual falls into the overall concept of personal-
ized or individualized medicine, which should also
be considered in pediatric MS, particularly as more
therapies become available. Validated outcome pre-
dictors are limited in adults and nonexistent in chil-
dren with MS.
Induction vs escalation therapy. Another relevant con-
cept when considering approaches to treating pediat-
ric MS is the idea of stepwise escalation in therapy vs
initiation with potent agents, which, if followed by
de-escalation, can be termed induction therapy.
There is presently insufficient evidence in adult and
pediatric MS to favor one approach over another,
and consideration of the overall disease course,
safety, and efficacy of various drugs currently guides
therapeutic decisions. The terminology of first- and
second-line treatments is disappearing in the academic
literature and is being supplanted with the concepts
of escalation/induction and individualized therapy;
however, the terms first/second-line treatments
are still often used by payers and regulatory
agencies.
SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF
PEDIATRIC MS As summarized in “Pediatric multi-
ple sclerosis: Clinical features and outcome” (p. S74),
pediatric MS appears to be overall a more inflammatory
disease than adult MS, with more frequent relapses5,6
and MRI lesion accrual.7 Paradoxically, long-term
disability accrual measured by the Expanded Disability
Status Scale is slower in pediatric-onset MS (POMS)
than adult-onset MS (AOMS); however, patients
with POMS will be more disabled than patients with
AOMS at a younger age.8 Between 30% and 50% of
children with MS experience significant cognitive issues
(see “Pediatric multiple sclerosis: Cognition and
mood,” p. S82), and adults with POMS may have
more
difficulty
with
processing
speed
than
patients
with
AOMS.9

development, outcomes tailored to pediatric MS

 should be considered. Therefore, when evaluating
therapeutic efficacy in children with MS, these
factors, and particularly cognition, should be taken
into account.
INADEQUATE
TREATMENT
RESPONSE
TO
INITIAL THERAPY The current knowledge on treat-
ment with IFN and GA in children, which have been
the most commonly used therapies in pediatric MS
over the last 10 years, is summarized in “Pediatric
multiple sclerosis: Conventional first-line treatment
and general management” (p. S97). IFNs and GA are
reported to decrease the relapse rate in adult patients
with MS by approximately 30%. In absence of
placebo-controlled double-blind treatment studies,
several retrospective or open-label studies in children
treated with IFN or GA have demonstrated similar or
greater reductions in relapse rates. However, as in
adult patients with MS, many children experience
breakthrough disease.
Definitions for inadequate treatment response
vary and have to take into account age (higher relapse
rates in pediatric than adult patients with MS), dis-
ease duration (relapse rate declines over time), and
disease activity prior to treatment initiation. A recent
International Pediatric MS Study Group (IPMSSG)
consensus statement proposes the following defini-
tion of inadequate treatment response in pediatric
MS: if the patient has been fully compliant on treat-
ment for at least 6 months and demonstrates (1) no
reduction in relapse rate or new T2 or contrast-
enhancing lesions (as compared to pretreatment); or
(2) 2 or more confirmed relapses (clinical or MRI)
within a 12-month period.10 This definition might
be conservative with regards to relapse activity, and
another review has suggested that an annual relapse
rate .0.6 in the first 2 years of disease or .0.35 in
years 2–5, or $3 new lesions in the first year and .2
lesions in years 2 and 3, would indicate inadequate
treatment response.11
None of these definitions has formally been
applied to pediatric MS cohorts, and the percentage
of children with inadequate treatment response is
therefore unknown. A retrospective analysis of 258
treated pediatric patients with MS revealed that
28% were considered by their health care practi-
tioners to have refractory disease on their first therapy
(mainly IFN and GA), and were therefore switched to
a second therapy after a mean of 1.3 years. Medica-
tion changes included lateral switches between IFN
and GA therapies, as well as use of natalizumab, dacli-
zumab, and cyclophosphamide, among others.
Adherence. Medication switches on account of poor
tolerance or noncompliance were reported in 16%
of patients after mean treatment duration of 1.1
years.12 Self-reported rate of nonadherence (defined
as not taking the prescribed medication .20% over
the past month) was as high as 37%13–47%14 in recent
surveys of pediatric patients with MS. A Russian study
found that in adolescents with MS, adherence was
better in therapies with fewer weekly injections.15 In
the absence of reliable biological adherence markers,
discrimination
between
inadequate
treatment
responses secondary to refractory disease or secondary
to nonadherence remains a major challenge. Use of
clinic-administered therapies or oral therapies could
potentially increase adherence, particularly in the
adolescent population, and should be a focus for
further study.
CURRENT
KNOWLEDGE
ON
SECOND-LINE
TREATMENTS IN PEDIATRIC MS None of the cur-
rently available immunomodulatory or immunosup-
pressive treatments in use for adult patients with
highly active relapsing-remitting MS has completed
randomized
controlled
trials
in
the
pediatric
population. However, the increasing number of
published
reports
of second-line agent
use in
children and adolescents with MS confirms the
need for additional therapies in this age group.
Natalizumab. Natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal
antibody targeting the a4 subunit of a4b1 integrin,
was first introduced in 2004. In its pivotal random-
ized controlled phase III trial, it demonstrated a 68%
reduction of the annualized relapse rate (ARR) (p ,
0.001), a 42% reduction of 12 weeks sustained pro-
gression of disability (p , 0.001), and an 83% reduc-
tion of new T2 lesions on MRI compared to placebo
(p , 0.001).16 However, 3 months after its initial
approval, natalizumab was temporarily withdrawn
from the market, following the occurrence of 3 cases
of
progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
(PML).17–19 Natalizumab was reintroduced for the
second time into the US market and the European
Union in 2006, with the stipulation of a Global Risk
Management Plan, mandated in the United States
(TOUCH: TYSABRI Outreach: Unified Commit-
ment to Health) and voluntarily in the rest of the
world (TYGRIS: TYSABRI Global Observation Pro-
gram in Safety). Three risk factors for PML associated
with natalizumab use have been identified: (1) posi-
tive serostatus for anti–JC virus (JCV) antibodies; (2)
prior use of immunosuppressants; (3) duration of
natalizumab therapy.20 The overall PML incidence,
as of June 3, 2015, in natalizumab-treated patients
was 3.96 cases/1,000 patients (95% confidence
interval [CI] 3.64–4.30 per 1,000 patients), with
the highest risk in JCV-positive patients who have
received
prior
immunosuppression
and
treatment
duration of .24 months (11.2/1,000; 95% CI

 8.6–14.3).21 The recently published long-term studies
(Safety of TYSABRI Redosing and Treatment, Tysabri
Observational Program) confirmed no additional serious
adverse events, other than PML.22,23
Natalizumab use in pediatric MS was reported in
several retrospective series.24–28 In an Italian report of
55 cases, natalizumab was started at a mean age of
14.4 6 2.6 years after a mean disease duration
of 25.5 6 19.2 months.24 ARR decreased from 2.4
6 1.6 in the year before natalizumab therapy to 0.1
6 0.2 at the end of the treatment period (p 5
0.001). Median Expanded Disability Status Scale
(EDSS) decreased from 2.5 (range 1–6.5) at treat-
ment initiation to 1.5 (range 0–5) at last visit. Sixty
percent of patients were free from clinical and MRI
activity after 30 months of treatment. A German/
Austrian cohort including 20 pediatric patients26 trea-
ted with natalizumab led to profound reduction of
the ARR (3.7 vs 0.4; p , 0.004) and median EDSS
score (2 vs 1; p , 0.024). The frequency of anti-JCV
antibodies was 39%24 and 38%,26 which is lower
compared to the reported prevalence in adults of
57%. Side effects were mild to moderate in both
series and comprised infections and hypersensitivity.
Neutralizing antibodies were found in 2 out of 16
patients.17 In both cases, natalizumab was withdrawn
due to a severe relapse or anaphylaxis. Interestingly,
a German study found that 50% of their pediatric
patients with MS overall were JCV antibody–posi-
tive, which was considerably higher than reported
in other studies.25
Discontinuation of natalizumab is often associated
with return of clinical and MRI activity. In 6 out of 8
pediatric patients who discontinued natalizumab, $1
relapse occurred within the following 6 months.26
Mitoxantrone. Mitoxantrone is approved for adult pa-
tients with rapidly evolving relapsing-remitting and
secondary progressive MS according to the MIMS
trial.29 However, mitoxantrone is associated with
increased risk of cardiomyopathy in up to 12% of
patients,30 therapy-related acute leukemia (up to
2.8%31), liver toxicity, and amenorrhea, and therefore
is rarely used. One report documents mitoxantrone use
in 4 pediatric patients with MS with 3.8–18 years of
follow-up.32
Laboratory
abnormalities
including
anemia, leukopenia, and elevation of liver enzymes
returned to normal levels after cessation of therapy.
One patient developed transient asymptomatic left
ventricular dysfunction during treatment. Leukemia
was not reported in this case series; however,
cardiomyopathy and leukemia may occur many years
after treatment cessation.30
Cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been used
mainly as a second- or third-line agent in very active
MS. Although formal approval has not been achieved,
cyclophosphamide may be effective in reducing
clinical
and
MRI
activity.
Cyclophosphamide
therapy
is
associated
with
significant
safety
concerns, including an increased risk of bladder
cancer as well as the risk of secondary leukemia
and infertility. A retrospective multicenter study
reported treatment of 17 pediatric patients with
severe relapses or ongoing relapse activity despite
conventional
therapy.33
Before
the
onset
of
cyclophosphamide therapy, the 14 patients had
a mean of 3.8 relapses per year, which decreased
to 1.1 during the first year of cyclophosphamide
therapy. Seven patients remained relapse-free. The
EDSS remained stable or decreased in 10 out of 12
patients. After cessation of therapy, 50% of
patients with a follow-up of more than 1 year
experienced relapses and required further second-
line therapies. Short-term side effects included
nausea and vomiting in 15/17 patients, alopecia
in 10/17 patients, and menstrual irregularities in
5 patients, as well as anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Lymphopenia was achieved in all children, according
to therapy goals. Long-term side effects included the
development of bladder cancer in one patient,
amenorrhea in 3 girls, and sterility in one patient.
Secondary leukemia was not reported in these cases.
Rituximab. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 chimeric
monoclonal
antibody
that has
been
shown
to
suppress clinical and MRI activity in MS and
neuromyelitis optica (NMO). A retrospective review
documents rituximab use in 144 children and
adolescents
with
pediatric
autoimmune
and
inflammatory disorders of CNS: NMDA receptor
encephalitis (n 5 39), opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia
syndrome (n 5 32), NMO (n 5 20), MS (n 5 4),
neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (18),
and other neuroinflammatory disorders (n 5 35).34
A definite, probable, or possible benefit was reported
in 125 of 144 (87%) patients. Rituximab improved
neurologic outcomes with a 7.6% risk of transient
adverse infectious events. A separate retrospective
study reported rituximab therapy in 11 pediatric
patients, including 8 patients with NMO and 3
patients with MS.35 Two out of the 3 children with
MS remained relapse-free on follow-up while 1 patient
continued to experience relapses. The treatment was
well-tolerated and no serious infections occurred.
Another report of 14 Swedish pediatric MS patients
(mean age 16.5 years) found rituximab treatment to be
safe
and
well-tolerated.
None
of
the
patients
experienced new relapses after a median treatment
duration of 23.6 months.36 A related agent is
ocrelizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody
to CD20, which completed phase III trials in adult
relapsing-remitting MS in 2015.

 Fingolimod. Fingolimod has had some limited use in
children. A retrospective review from Brazil docu-
mented 17 children between the ages of 14 and 17
treated with fingolimod. Mean pretreatment ARR
was 2.8, EDSS was 2.05 6 0.98. Patients were fol-
lowed for a mean of 8.6 months (range 1–18
months). Only one patient had a relapse 14 months
after starting treatment. Of the 12 patients with an
MRI 3–6 months after the start of treatment, 1
patient had a new lesion. No major adverse events
were noted in this study.37
Several drugs are currently in clinical trials for pedi-
atric MS (table 1). Ongoing trials include those for 3
oral therapies, which are approved for adult MS by the
EMA and FDA: fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, and
teriflunomide. Mechanism of action and adverse events
observed in adult MS are provided in table 2.
CONCEPTS
AROUND
EMERGING
CLINICAL
TRIALS
OF
NOVEL
AGENTS
IN
PEDIATRIC
MS All the pediatric MS treatment studies published
to date are observational studies. However, federal
mandates from the US Congress introduced in
2003 and amended in 2007 and similar mandates
from the European Union in 2008 require pediatric
studies to be performed for all new therapies. In the
United States, the Pediatric Research Equity Act
(PREA) passed in 2003 required a pediatric assess-
ment for certain applications unless waived or
deferred. The PREA was amended in 2007 to apply
to any new active ingredient, indication, dosage form,
regimen, or route. Waivers are granted if drug will not
be used substantially in children, or if ineffective or
unsafe in children, or if formulation cannot be made.
An accompanying piece of legislation termed the Best
Pharmaceuticals for Children Act was passed in 2002
and amended in 2007, and allowed the voluntary
submission of a written request if studies are needed
in the pediatric population, allowing the sponsor 6
months of additional marketing exclusivity. Similarly,
the EMA and its pediatric committee, the PDCO, ad-
vises on Pediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs). As of
July 2008, the condition for registering a new drug
is an agreed-upon PIP. Similar to the written
request, compliance with the PIP is rewarded by 6
months of additional market exclusivity.
Given these mandates, the need for randomized
clinical trials in pediatric MS was recognized. The
IPMSSG published 2 consensus statements around
this topic. The first, published in 2012,10 summarized
consensus from 50 IPMSSG members and concluded
the following:
• Exposure of pediatric patients with MS to new
therapeutic agents should occur in the context
of carefully designed clinical trials.
• Placebo-controlled trials in pediatric MS should
be of brief duration and should have rigorous
monitoring to ensure a rescue strategy for chil-
dren in the placebo arm who experience rapid
accrual of physical, cognitive, or MRI burden of
disease.
• Development and growth parameters should be
included in all studies, as well as long-term
impact on fertility.
• Contraceptive use and close pregnancy monitor-
ing should be considered for female patients of
child-bearing potential.
The second article is a summary statement from
a meeting held in January 20121 with representatives
from the FDA, EMA, Health Canada, academic neu-
rologists, and representatives from pharmaceutical
companies. The major additional conclusions were
as follows:
• Randomized controlled trials are necessary from
a regulatory standpoint for drug approval, and
will provide robust data to guide clinical care.
• Patient study populations should include ,10-
year-old participants.
• Relapse is a clinically meaningful outcome mea-
sure for trials meeting regulatory requirements.
• Inclusion of an internationally applicable neuro-
psychological battery for pediatric MS that is sen-
sitive to cognitive deficits in pediatric MS and
suited for detecting reliable change is needed.

 • A prospective registry is needed to obtain data
on safety and clinical outcome in patients
exposed to MS therapies during childhood to
evaluate long-term impact.
Various aspects of clinical trial design were dis-
cussed, including the use of placebo vs active compar-
ator and ARR vs time to relapse designs, as well as
estimated sample sizes needed for these various de-
signs. Since then, several clinical trials in pediatric
MS have been launched, and their design and specif-
ics are summarized in table 1.
VIEW TO FUTURE APPROACHES TO THERAPY
WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND EMERGING
KNOWLEDGE OF THERAPEUTICS IN PEDIATRIC
MS Apart from those listed in table 1, additional
therapies are in or have completed late-stage trials in
adult MS. Many of these newer agents will require
pediatric studies. Some considerations for moving
forward with such studies are listed in table 3.
The emergence of newer classes of drugs that are
being developed for MS, including remyelinating
therapies,38 neuroprotective therapies,39 and symp-
tomatic treatments,40 presents new opportunities
and challenges when considering use in pediatric
MS. Some of these classes will apply to children,
and consideration of outcome measure for pediatric
studies is critical for effective evaluation of these
therapies.
The most important factor to keep in mind when
considering long-term treatment is how therapies
impact pediatric patients and their families over the
short and long term. A major need is a means to eval-
uate the long-term outcomes of therapies on the
physical, developmental, cognitive, and psychosocial
outcomes in patients with childhood-onset MS into
adulthood, potentially through the implementation
of long-term outcomes registries. International col-
laboration among physicians, patients and their
families, regulators, and the pharmaceutical industry
is required in all of the aspects discussed above.

Considerations for future clinical trials in pediatric multiple sclerosis
(MS)
1. There are a limited number of children worldwide with MS; therefore it is recommended that
only one phase III trial be initiated for each agent, and to avoid the situation of multiple studies,
possibly to satisfy different regulators, for one drug. Wherever possible, all international trials
should be harmonized.
2. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies should precede and inform dosing for phase
II/III trials.
3. There is a need for increased awareness and training of clinicians treating children with MS in
clinical trial methodology and understanding the risks and benefits that clinical trials offer.
4. Further discussions with patients and their families regarding their goals for treatment and
clinical trials and to develop patient-centered outcomes are needed.
5. Continued discussion and information about the state of the field for regulators and the
pharmaceutical industry is required.
6. There is a need to explore strategies to facilitate and expedite clinical trials in pediatric MS.
7. Methodology to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy outcomes in pediatric patients with
MS, particularly those participating in clinical trials, is needed.
