Targeted Delivery of STAT-3 Modulator to
Breast Cancer Stem-Like Cells Downregulates a
Series of Stemness Genes

Abstract
Cancer stem cells are known to be controlled by pathways that
are dormant in normal adult cells, for example, PTEN, which is a
negative regulator of transcription factor STAT3. STAT3 regulates
genes that are involved in stem cell self-renewal and thus repre-
sents a novel therapeutic target of enormous clinical significance.
Studies on breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) have been also signif-
icantly correlated with STATs. We describe here for the first time a
novel strategy to selectively target CSCs and to induce down-
regulation of STAT3 downstream target genes reducing expression
of series of "stem-ness genes" in treated tumors. In vitro and in vivo
experiments were performed to evaluate functional activity with
gene and protein expression studies. The results of the study
indicate that this targeted delivery approach deactivates STAT3
causing a reduction of CD44þ/CD24� CSC populations with
aptly tracked gene and protein regulations of "stemness" char-
acteristics. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(1); 119–29. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Despite significant improvement in survival rates of breast
cancer patients, it is on rise in developing countries such as Brazil
and China. Main concern associated with breast cancer has been
its high malignancy with considerable metastatic potential and
recurrence with irregular time lags (1–4). Years after removal of
the primary tumor, recurrence of tumors at secondary locations
often associate with higher mortality rate in cancer patients.
Resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy, metastasis, and eventual
relapse have been attributed to a distinct tumor subpopulation
with "stem-like" cell property known as cancer stem cells (CSC;
refs. 3, 5, 6). These cell populations had been associated with
marked degree of cellular heterogeneity. To delegate unregulated
growth of tumors via serial acquisition of genetic events resulted
in the turning on of genes promoting proliferation, silencing of
genes involved in inhibiting proliferation, and circumventing of
genes involved in programmed cell death (7, 8). Survival of CSCs
vary to dependability on wide ranges of genes and mechanisms
like transglutaminase2 (TGM2) for epidermal squamous cell
carcinoma stem cells, kinase-independent scaffolding functions
of FAK for influencing cell survival and breast cancer stem cell
(BCSC) proliferation (9–11) and emergence of castration resis-
tant prostate cancer (CRPC) via androgen receptor (AR)-mediated
survival pathways (12–14). A series of gene regulation could be
correlated with CSCs (Fig. 1A).
These cell populations were identified with cell surface markers
CD44þ/CD24�/low as was found in breast CSCs (BSC) based on
mouse model (15). BSCs in mouse mammary tumors were also
found to be overexpressing CD133 (16). Some other important
genes associated with CSCs were LIN28A/LIN28B. They act main-
ly as oncogenes and found to be overexpressed in human malig-
nancies to play important role in the maintenance of CSCs (17).
LIN28B has also been firmly demonstrated as one of the critical
molecules required for CSC growth and tumorigenesis in lung
cancer (18). Downregulation of LIN28B decreased self-renewal
capability of prostate CSCs. Among other markers, aldehyde
dehydrogenase class I (ALDH1) has been identified as CSC-
specific marker in multiple cancers. Current evidences also indi-
cate that some specific pluripotency genes, such as OCT4, SOX2,
NANOG, expressed in human cancer types as putative regulators
of embryonic stem cell identity (19). EpCAM is expressed in a
variety of human cancers, progenitor, and stem cells; thus, it is one
of the markers that identifies tumor cells with high tumorigenicity
(20). CXCR4 has a role not only in cancer metastasis but also in
regulating CSCs in breast cancer (21).
Studies on BSCs were also significantly correlated with
STATs (22). In recent years, STAT-3 has been well studied for its
impending role in survival, invasion, and promotion of tumor
cell proliferation, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, obesity,
inflammation, and premetastatic niche formation (23). In addi-
tion to these, STAT3 plays a crucial role as potent immune
checkpoint for multiple antitumor immune responses and
immune cells, which are recruited to the tumor microenviron-
ment to promote tumor progression (24–27). Thus, strategies that
block STAT3 may prove efficacious for sustained cancer treatment.
Several therapeutic approaches are being pursued, including
inhibitors of STAT3 function, agents that block either dimeriza-
tion or DNA binding by STAT3, and strategies to reduce STAT3
expression (28). In addition, cell surface receptor inhibitors,
kinase inhibitors, STAT3 SH2 domain inhibitors, and inhibitors

 for STAT3 DNA-binding domain were used to disrupt STAT3
signaling and activity. Specifically, garcinol was found to inhibit
phosphorylation and acetylation of STAT3 and preventing its
dimerization (29), whereas U-STAT3 could bind AT-rich DNA
sequences causing regulation of chromatin structure, and even-
tually recognition of secondary structures in addition to tran-
scriptional activator functions (30). Acetylation on STAT3
increases its DNA binding, transactivational, and nuclear locali-
zation activity. Increase of STAT3 transactivation activity by acet-
ylation could be the result of the tight DNA binding and increased
STAT3 nuclear localization (31). Among these, STAT-3 inhibition
approach can be highly effective for cancer treatment as normal
cells can tolerate a reduction in STAT3 function, but cancer cells
require constitutive STAT3 signaling for its survival.
STAT3 signaling is a major intrinsic pathway for cancer inflam-
mation and capable of inducing a large number of genes that are
crucial for inflammation including IL6, 10, 11, 17, 23, CXCL12,
and COX-2. STAT3 is regarded as a direct transcriptional activator
of VEGF gene (32). Constitutive activation of STAT3 upregulates
VEGF expression and tumor angiogenesis in melanoma cells (33)
and pancreatic cancer cells. Activation of STAT3 signaling in
tumor cells or in inflammatory immune cells modulates secretion
of various inflammatory factors such as IL6 and TNF that act as an
immunosuppressor and increase the probability of survival of
tumor cells (34). Abnormal expression of FGFRs is often linked
with development and progression of a variety of human cancers
and STAT3 as a mediator of amplified FGFR signaling (35).
In pursuit of a suitable STAT-3 inhibitor, we considered drug
repurposing strategy. Drug repositioning of already approved
agents helps to overcome physical limitations of poorly soluble
drugs, off-target toxicity, and others. The approach represents an
attractive way to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy and aids to
substantial cost savings in drug development efforts. Niclosamide
was originally FDA approved for treating patients with Taeniasis
saginata as vermicide. Later on, it was studied in various trans-
formed human cancer cells as an anticancer agent (36–40) via

 regulation of NFkB (39), Wnt/b-catenin (41), Notch (42),
mTORC1 (43), and STAT3 (44) pathways and relates to stem-
ness of CSCs. In specific studies, niclosamide was found to be
highly effective against breast cancer and breast cancer stem-like
cells (Fig. 1B; ref. 45). A nanomedicine approach is sought to
explore the repositioning of this agent. In nanomedicine, the
hydrophobic nature of drugs has favored its incorporation into
many nanoparticle formulations, including amphiphilic lipid
(46–48) or polymer-based particles (49). Although drug encap-
sulation in nanoparticles can enrich the local concentration of
drug molecules and improved functional activity, but cannot
completely ensure the reach of these unguided nanoparticles to
desired sites/cells. In this study, a polymeric, niclosamide-incor-
porated, nanoparticle was conjugated with CD44-targeting pep-
tide, generating CD44-NIC-Veh (CD44-tagged niclosamide-load-
ed nano-vehicles) for efficiently treating breast cancer–like cells
(BSC). An array of in vitro and in vivo experiments was performed
to evaluate functional activity of CD44-NIC-Veh with gene and
protein expression studies (Fig. 1C).
Materials and Methods
Materials
Niclosamide was obtained from AK Scientific, Inc. Reagent-
grade polyethylene glycol cetyl ether, and poly(styrene)-block-
poly(acrylic acid) were obtained from Sigma Life Sciences and
were used as received. Tetrahydrofuran was obtained from Avan-
tor Performance Materials . A cellulosic membrane 20,000 Da
MW cutoff (Thermo Scientific Inc.) cassettes were used for dialysis.
Please see Supplementary Methods for preparation procedure
of Nano-Veh and NIC-Veh particles, Cell viability assay protocol,
procedure of FACS analysis of CD44þ cell populations, and
apoptosis assay.
Preparation of CD44-NIC-Veh
CD44-NIC-Veh was prepared by surface conjugation of anti–
CD44-peptide (RLVSYNGIIFFLK) by 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylami-
nopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) coupling. Prepared NIC-Veh (1
mL, 200 mmol/L of loaded niclosamide) was stirred at room
temperature with EDC (0.1 mmol/L) for 20 minutes in DPBS (pH
7.4). Anti-CD44 antibody (0.18 mg, 0.1 mmol) and a catalytic
amount of 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) were further
added. Mixture was stirred for next 12 hours at room temperature.
At the end of the process, sample was purified from free isourea
molecules (produced as byproduct of the EDC coupling) and
unconsumed DMAP by dialysis against DPBS (pH ¼ 7.4) using a
10,000 Da MWCO cellulose membrane for 24 hours. Purified
samples were stored at 4�C till next use for physiochemical or
biological studies.
Dynamic light scattering measurements
Hydrodynamic diameter distribution and distribution averages
for NIC-Veh, CD44-NIC-Veh, and controls in aqueous medium
were determined by dynamic light scattering. Hydrodynamic
diameters were determined using a Malvern Zetasizer ZS90 par-
ticle size analyzer. Measurements were made following dialysis
(MWCO 20 kDa dialysis tubing, Spectrum Laboratories) of nano-
particle suspensions into deionized water (filtered through 0.2 m
filter). Nanoparticles were dialyzed against water before analysis.
Scattered light was collected at a fixed angle of 90�. A photo-
multiplier aperture of 400 mm was used, and the incident laser
power was adjusted to obtain a photon counting rate between 200
and 300 kcps. Only measurements for which the measured and
calculated baselines of the intensity autocorrelation function
agreed to within þ0.1% were used to calculate nanoparticle
hydrodynamic diameter values. All determinations were made
in multiples of five consecutive measurements.
Animal studies
All the animal experiments were performed in accordance with
the approved guidelines. The experimental animal protocol was
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC), University of Illinois, Urbana–Champaign, and satis-
fied all University and National Institutes of Health (NIH,
Bethesda, MD) rules for the humane use of laboratory animals.
All animal experiments were designed to minimize the use of
animals. To detect at least of 20% difference in tumor size, we
decided to generate 2 tumors per animal as 5 mice per group.
Athymic nude mice were procured from Charles River Laborato-
ries International, Inc. Upon arrival, animals were allowed for
one-week acclimation. Animals were housed as one animal per
cage with free access to food and water. Animals were housed in
Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign (Champaign, IL).
Tumor regression studies
Isoflurane was used to anesthetized animals before injecting
the MCF-7 cells suspended in Matrigel (50%, v/v). We subcuta-
neously injected approximately 5 � 106 MCF-7 cells suspended in
40 mL of Matrigel using a Hamilton autoinjector syringe tipped
with a 26 gauge 1/200 long needle at two sites in the flanks of each
mouse. Mice were monitored for recovery from the anesthesia. A
minimum of 0.5 � 0.5 cm2 size of tumors were grown on the back
of mice after cell injection. We did not find any significant
discomfort to the mice in the time span of the experiment. We
monitored the mice daily for signs of discomfort and any behavior
change. Mice body weight was measured every week for any
significant change and found no more than 10%. Changes in
parameters of physiologic function or abnormal behavior (short-
ness of breath, unsteady gait, abnormal eating behavior, phys-
ical abnormalities, rough hair coat due to lack of grooming, or
lethargy) were reported to division of animal research. Criteria
for stopping experiments or sacrificing animals were set up as
animal body weight drops by 20% or tumor increase to 17 mm
� 17 mm. Tumor size was determined by calculating the tumor
volume via formula Tumor volume ¼ ðlength2 � widthÞ=2
Animals were kept untreated till their tumors grew to a min-
imum of 5 mm � 5 mm before starting the treatment protocol.
CD44-NIC-Veh were prepared at 5 mmol/L concentration and
injected in tumors grown to at least 5 mm � 5 mm dimensions.
Isoflurane–oxygen mixture anesthetic was maintained with 1%–
2% isoflurane via an inlet tube in animal trap chamber. A second
tube from the chamber was used to remove carbon dioxide and
excess anesthetic. A 40-mL volume of formulation were injected
per site on every fourth day and followed till 44th day for tumor
growth and regression.
Statistical analysis
Biostatistical analysis was performed on tumor volume
regression study results using one-way ANOVA considering
volume of tumors in animals treated with Nano-Veh as a

 comparison. A P value of 0.05 was reported as statistically
significant (indicated by �).
Animal dissection, tumor collection, processing, embedding,
and sectioning
On the completion of tumor regression experiments, animals
were euthanized under CO2 influx. Dissections were performed
on animals to collect tumors and stored in tissue cassettes dipped
in 10% formalin. Samples were transferred to Leica ASP300 tissue
processor for performing the tissue fixation. Steps of tissue incu-
bation included processing with neutral buffered saline for 45
minutes, twice with ethanol (70%) for 45 minutes, ethanol (80%)
for 45 minutes, twice with ethanol (95%) for 45 minutes, twice
with absolute ethanol for 45 minutes, twice with xylene for 45
minutes, and finally thrice with paraffin wax for 45 minutes. Wax
was melted at 65�C using a metal cast for submerging the
processed tumors for paraffin embedding. Embedded tumor
blocks were clamped in microtome (Leica) and sectioned at 7-
mm thickness.
Histology and H&E staining
Paraffin-embedded sections (5-mm thickness) were subjected
to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. H&E staining was
performed by following the standard protocol provided by core
facility at Institute of Genomic Biology (IGB). The morphologic
changes of H&E-stained tissue with individual fixation were
analyzed at magnification �20 and �40.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated from NIC-Veh–treated and control
mice xenograft tumors using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as
per the manufacturer's protocol. RNA pellets were dissolved in
nuclease-free water and stored at �80�C until analysis. Quality of
the isolated RNA was determined using a Nano Drop spectro-
photometer (Thermo Scientific) and analyzed by an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer using an RNA Nano bioanalyzer chip to determine
the RNA integrity as well as the presence/absence of gDNA by the
Carver High-Throughput DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Unit
(HTS Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). The concen-
tration of the RNA was determined by the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Life Technologies) as per the manu-
facturer's protocol.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Reverse transcription of RNA was performed from 1 mg total
RNA in the presence of RNase inhibitor, random hexamer primers
(50 ng/mL), deoxynucleotides (dNTP, 10 mmol/L), SuperScript III
reverse transcriptase (200 U/mL), and reverse transcriptase buffer
in a 20-mL final reaction volume using SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies).
Relative quantification of the genes was performed by using
Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (2X; Applied Biosystems) in
TaqMan ABI 7900 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).
Relative expression of a total of 32 genes, that is, STAT3, MYC,
BCL2, IL10, MCL1, IL11, MMP9, MUC1, EGFR, COX2, IFNG,
VEGF, CD44, CD24, PROM1, LIN28A, LIN28B, ALDH1A1,
POU5F1, NOTCH1, SOX2, CTGF, MMP1, EPCAM, FGFR1,
ERBB2, CXCR4, PROCR, TGFB1, CTNNB1, WNT1, and WNT2
were studied. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as endog-
enous control to normalize for differences in reverse transcription
efficiency. The thermal cycling conditions for real-time PCR were
one cycle of 50�C for 2 minutes (AmpErase uracil-N-glycosylase
activation) and 95�C for 10 minutes (AmpliTaq Gold activation),
followed by 40 cycles of 95�C for 15 seconds (denaturation) and
60�C for 1 minute (annealing and extension). Gene expression
levels were calculated using the 2�DDC
t method relative to the
internal control.
Protein extraction and Western blotting
Western blotting was used to examine the expression of four
proteins (STAT3, pSTAT3, CD24, and CD44). Total protein con-
tent in the tumors was extracted using Minute Total Protein
Extraction Kit (Invent Biotechnologies) as per the manufacturer's
protocol. The protein concentrations of the samples were deter-
mined by a colorimetric assay using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Twenty-five micrograms of protein
extracts were separated by gradient (4%–20%) SDS-PAGE and
then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using a
wet transfer unit (company name), blocked with 2.5% BSA in TBS-
Tween buffer (0.12 mol/L Tris-base, 1.5 mol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween
20) for an hour at room temperature, and incubated overnight at
4�C with the appropriate primary antibodies; b-actin (1:3,000),
CD24 (1:3,000), CD44 (1:3,000), STAT3 (1: 3,000), and pSTAT3
(1:3,000). This was followed by incubation with a horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(Thermo Scientific) for an hour and subsequent washing in TBST.
The blots were developed using the Chemiluminescent Kit
(Thermo Scientific) to detect the target protein as per the man-
ufacturer's protocol.

Results
CD44-NIC-Veh preparation, characterization, and stability
CD44-NIC-Veh particles were prepared by conjugating NIC-
Veh particles (mixed micelles of polyethylene cetyl ether with
polystyrene-b-polyacrylic acid; Supplementary Methods) with
CD44-targeting peptide (RLVSYNGIIFFLK) using EDC/DMAP
coupling method (Supplementary Fig. S1). Prepared formula-
tions (Nano-Veh, NIC-Veh and CD44-NIC-Veh) were character-
ized for size, stability, drug loading, and release patterns along
with anhydrous morphologic distributions. Drug loading and
release efficiency of CD44-NIC-Veh was found to be around 55%
� 10% (Fig. 2A) and 70% � 15%, respectively (Fig. 2B). The
average hydrodynamic diameter was approximately 100 � 25 nm
in the case of the CD44-NIC-Veh (Fig. 2C). Anhydrous morpho-
logic distribution and surface topography of CD44-NIC-Vehs

 were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM
studies showed sizeof approximately 100 nm for CD44-NIC-Vehs
(Supplementary Fig. S2D). CD44-NIC-Veh formulations under
low pH conditions of approximately 4.6 showed destabilization
like in case of NIC-Veh (Supplementary Fig. S2B), whereas Nano-
Veh were more stable at lower pH values (Supplementary Fig.
S2C). Hydrodynamic diameter of Nano-Veh and NIC-Veh was
found to be approximately 90 � 15 nm (Supplementary Fig. S2B
and S2C), whereas Nic-Veh resulted in a drug loading of 80% �
15%, but could release only approximately 20% � 10% (96
hours; Supplementary Fig. S2D). A higher drug release level in
CD44-conjugated
CD44-NIC-Veh
particles
helped
in
drug
release. Anhydrous morphology and surface topography of
NIC-Veh by TEM (Supplementary Fig. S2E) and AFM (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2F) gave a size of approximately 50 nm and height
profile 10 nm, respectively. An AFM analysis of CD44-NIC-Veh
nanoparticles revealed height profile of approximately 20 nm
(Supplementary Fig. S2G).
In vitro response on CD44þ population post-CD44-NIC-Veh
treatment
Specific detection of CD44þ MCF-7 cell population was done
by flow cytometry experiments performed on CD44 antibody–
tagged MCF-7 cells while visualized under bright field microscopy
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Cells were treated with niclosamide and
CD44-NIC-Veh with 10 mmol/L for 72 hours (Supplementary
Methods). Cells were also treated with NIC-Veh or NanoVh,
nanoparticles with no niclosamide as controls of different niche.
At the end of the incubation, cells were further incubated with 2 mg
rat anti-mouse CD44 mAb conjugated to fluorescein isothiocya-
nate (FITC, Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 2-mL
DMEM. DPBS washed (thrice) cells were used for analysis by flow
cytometry. Around 10% of growing MCF-7 cell population (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4A) was found to be CD44þ possessing stem-like
cancer cell properties (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Any decrease in
CD44þ population would indicate the loss of stemness in cancer
cells and if it was achieved after treatment would correlate with
stem cell regression ability of the treating agent. It was noticed that
treatment with NanoVeh did not alter the CD44þ population
(Supplementary Fig. S4C) to any significant level, whereas niclo-
samide (Supplementary Fig. S4D) and NIC-Veh (Supplementary
Fig. S4E) only reduced it to approximately 20%–30%. Maximum
reduction in CD44þ cells was reported for CD44-NIC-Veh treat-
ment, with a regression effect as low as approximately 60% of total
CD44þ population, that is, 4% of total population with CD44þ
character (Supplementary Fig. S4F and S4G). The overall change
in cancer cell population was studied by MTT assay. An additional
cancer cell line of breast origin, MDA-MB231 (triple-negative
breast cancer) was also used for overall cell growth inhibition
study and found to be little less responsive against CD44-NIC-Veh
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4H) as in case of MCF-7 (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4I), although in both the cases, IC50 was found to
be approximately 2 mmol/L across 48-hour time point. After
establishing mechanistic function of niclosamide-loaded Nano-
Veh in MCF-7 cells, experiments were performed in MDA-MB231
to find the cause of lower response. Activity mechanism of
niclosamide-loaded Nano-Veh in MDA-MB231 was established
by performing apoptosis assay. Propidium iodide (PI) is a known
DNA binder a good indicator of genetic DNA integrity. PI-stained
cells with high DNA degradation, resulting from induced apo-
ptosis (Supplementary Methods), show lower red fluorescence in
flow-assisted cell studies (Supplementary Fig. S5). An improved
apoptosis induction efficiency was found in case of MDA-MB231
cells treated with CD44-NIC-Veh (Supplementary Fig. S5E) with
approximately 25% cells in apoptotic region of cell histogram
compared with nontargeted NIC-Veh treatment (�15%; Supple-
mentary Fig.S5D) and niclosamide alone (�10%; Supplementary
Fig. S5C) where blank particles (Nano-Veh; Supplementary Fig.
S5B) were not effective to any significant level. These results
signify the effect of CD44-targeting–mediated improvements in
induced apoptosis in MDA-MB231, but also indicate lower effi-
ciency compared with MCF-7.

 In vivo evaluation of CD44-NIC-Veh efficiency in tumor
regression
The tumor regression ability of CD44-NIC-Veh was verified by
treating xenograft tumors generated from MCF-7 cells in nude
mice. Tumors grown to a minimum size of 0.5 � 0.5 cm were
injected with CD44-NIC-Veh (Tumor #5B, 5C, 15A, 15B, 24A)
and Nano-Veh [Tumor #6B, 6D, 7A, 20D (termed as C)] in 40-mL
volume four times and followed till total of 44 days before
sacrificing and collecting the tumor tissue (Fig. 3A). All group of
animals were made by random assignments and found to show
no biostatistical significant in tumor size on the first day of
treatment injections. Tumor sizes were followed for 44 days but
first injection was given only at 24th day, when tumors gained a
minimum size of around 5 mm � 5 mm. The volume of grown
tumors were followed for regression along the time of investiga-
tion using caliper measurements and found to be biologically
significant in reducing the tumor size for CD44-NIC-Veh treat-
ment compared with Nano-Veh–treated tumors (Fig. 3B). Tumors
treated with blank nanoparticles (Nano-Veh) were grown as high
as 200% larger compared with treated ones (Fig. 3C). One-way
ANNOVA was applied considering volume of tumors on animals
treated with Nano-Veh as comparison line for volume of tumors
on animals treated with CD44-NIC-Veh. P ¼ 0.05 was reported as
statistically significant (indicated by �; Fig. 3B and C).
Liver enzymes and kidney function were evaluated after admin-
istration of CD44-NIC-Veh in rodents (n ¼ 3). Our preliminary
results indicated that an initial (2 hours) negligible influence on
mice liver function (BUN ¼ 20 � 3 mg/dL; creatinine ¼ 0.5 � 0
mg/dL; albumin ¼ 3.7 � 0.2 g/dL; AST ¼ 192 � 35 mL and ALT ¼
56 � 2 mL) 2 hours postinjection of CD44-NIC-Veh, which then
begins to resolve toward normal physiologic levels 24 hours
posttreatment (BUN ¼ 17 � 3 mg/dL; creatinine ¼ 0.2 � 0
mg/dL; albumin ¼ 2.8 � 0.2 g/dL; AST ¼ 132 � 35 mL, and ALT
¼ 42 � 2 mL). This suggests the burden of CD44-NIC-Veh on the
liver and kidneys is an acute response that resolves as the CD44-
NIC-Veh are subsequently metabolized and secreted. Although an
in-depth safety study is warranted, this preliminary experiment
points to the overall safety of the particles.
Tumor reduction was further corroborated with histopatho-
logic analyses. The signs of tissue damage resulting from the
treatment of CD44-NIC-Veh were clearly evident. Representative
tissue sections from group of animals treated with Nano-Veh
(Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B) and CD44-NIC-Veh (Supple-
mentary Fig. S6C and S6D) were used to compare histologic
features
generated
posttreatments.
Significantly
fragmented
nuclei and retracted cytoplasm were seen across the sections from
CD44-NIC-Veh–treated tumors at �20 (Supplementary Fig. S6C)
and �40 magnification (Supplementary Fig. S6D). These signs
further support the induction of apoptosis in CD44-NIC-Veh–
treated tumors.
IHC responses post tumor treatment with CD44-NIC-Veh
Tumor growth regression could be corroborated with STAT-3
inhibition in CD44-NIC-Veh–treated animals. Loss in level of
STAT-3 phosphorylation has been established as the process of
niclosamide-mediated phosphoSTAT-3 (pSTAT-3) inhibition,
indicating the possibility of CD44-NIC-Veh working in similar
way. To image the extent of pSTAT-3 protein expression (red)
in CD44-NIC-Veh–treated tumors, immune-labeling was per-
formed on paraffin-embedded tumor sections. Immunolabeling
was performed by following standard protocol. b-Actin (green)
was used as background protein for all the sections investigated.
Representative CD44 antibody immune-labeled cross sections of
tumors treated with CD44-NIC-Veh (Fig. 4A–F) and NanoVeh
(Fig. 4G–L) revealed the downregulation activity of CD44-NIC-
Veh with drastic decrease in pSTAT-3 level. Sections were treated
with pSTAT-3 antibody (red) against basal protein b-actin (green)
around cell nuclei (blue) to show significantly high level of
pSTAT-3 in NanoVeh–treated tumors compared with tumors
treated with CD44-NIC-Veh (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Targeted vehicle treatment induced downregulation of STAT3
downstream target genes
To further support our findings that CD44-NIC-Veh treatment
caused inhibition of STAT3, we studied the expression of the
STAT3 downstream target genes by quantitative PCR. An average
of gene expression values from five control tumor samples was
used as base for comparative change calculation. Expression of 11
downstream target genes of STAT3, that is, MYC, BCL2, IL10,
MCL1, IL11, MMP9, MUC1, EGFR, COX2, IFNG, and VEGF were
studied. No significant difference in expression of STAT3 tran-
script was found between control and treatment samples indicat-
ing that CD44-NIC-Veh did not interfere with the STAT3

 transcription (Fig. 5). The expression of all the studied STAT3
downstream target genes were downregulated (Fig. 5) indicating
that CD44-NIC-Veh treatment caused inhibition of STAT3. Over-
all, CD44-NIC-Veh treatment does not affect total STAT3 tran-
scription but induces downregulation of the STAT3 target genes,
which supports our earlier findings that CD44-NIC-Veh inhibits
phosphorylation of STAT3 in turn making it inactive and host cells
lose their survival ability under treatment condition.

collected from CD44-NIC-Veh–treated animals. Here, red fluorescence indicated the level of CD44 protein availability, which was inhibited with niclosamide

 Reduced expression of "stemness genes" in CD44-NIC-Veh–
treated tumors
In recent years, CSCs have been recognized as important
components in carcinogenesis, and could form basis of many
tumor types. To evaluate the role of STAT3 in CSC self-renewal, we
have studied the expression of a panel of CSC marker genes that
are reported to be involved in the regulation of self-renewal of the
CSCs. An average of gene expression values from five control
tumor samples was used as base for comparative change cal-
culation. Expression of a total of 20 "stemness genes" namely
CD44, CD24, PROM1, LIN28A, LIN28B, ALDH1A1, POU5F1,
NOTCH1, SOX2, CTGF, MMP1, EPCAM, FGFR1, ERBB2,
CXCR4, PROCR, TGFB1, CTNNB1, WNT1, and WNT2 were
studied in control tumors and tumors treated with CD44-NIC-
Veh. CD44 expression was downregulated in treated tumors,
whereas CD24 was upregulated indicating a reduction of
CD44þ cell population and increase in CD24þ cell population
in CD44-NIC-Veh–treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Significantly reduced expressions of all the other stemness
genes were found in tumors treated with CD44-NIC-Veh in
comparison with control tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8),
indicating a reduction of the CSC population in treated sam-
ples. Overall, inactivation of STAT3 by CD44-NIC-Veh reduced
of CSC population in mice xenograft tumors.
CD44-NIC-Veh inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 and induced
an increase in the ratio of CD24 to CD44 in mice xenografts
Niclosamide inhibits STAT3 by blocking its phosphorylation.
To validate this, Western blot analysis was used to determine the
effect of CD44-NIC-Veh on the expression of total and phosphor-
ylated STAT3. Figure 6A–C depicts that CD44-NIC-Veh treatment
induced downregulation of phosphorylated STAT3, whereas no
difference in total STAT3 protein expression between control and
treated samples was observed, indicating that CD44-NIC-Veh
inhibits the posttranslational phosphorylation of the STAT3. We
further studied the effect of CD44-NIC-Veh treatment on the
expression of CD44 and CD24 proteins in mice xenograft tumors.
It was found that following treatment, the expression level of
CD24 was upregulated (Fig. 6D) and CD44 was downregulated
(Fig. 6E) because of which the ratio of CD24 to CD44 in treated

Discussion
CSCs have been highlighted lately, because of the opinion
that these CSCs are the culprits for therapeutic resistance,
metastasis and recurrence of the tumors, and therefore, might
be selected as the target of treatment. The issue of cancer
resurrection and metastasis have been largely attributed to the
presence of stem-like cancer cells. In case of breast cancer, a
subpopulation of cells expressing the CD44þ/CD24� pheno-
type have been reported to represent such stem-like popula-
tions. Selective delivery of STAT3 modulators by using CD44
targeted nano-vehicle could offer a strategy for regression of
BCSCs. STAT family proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcrip-
tion factors initially discovered as acute phase response factors
(22). In resting cells, STATs are generally located in the cyto-
plasm in their inactive state. Phosphorylation of specific tyro-
sine residue is an essential step for STAT activation. Once
activated, STAT dimerizes to other STATs by reciprocal SH2
phosphotyrosine interaction, leading to its translocation into
the nucleus followed by its binding to the specific enhancer
elements for initiation of transcription. Of the STAT family of
proteins, STAT3 has received greatest attention as it is involved
in a number of oncogenic signaling pathways and intracellular
signal transduction pathways. STAT3 regulate Cyclin D1, cMyc,
BclXL, Mcl1 and p53, thereby regulating cellular proliferation
and survival. It has been found that cancer cells harboring
aberrant STAT3 activity have elevated levels of antiapoptotic
(Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL) and cell-cycle regulating proteins
(cyclin D1 and c-Myc). STAT3 plays a crucial role in cell
invasion by regulating the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP),
including MMP-9 and MMP-1.
Our initial study focused on the self-assembly of an amphi-
philic polymer in presence of niclosamide (50). This exciting
finding led us delve deeper to establish effects in vivo after active
targeting to cells with stem-ness and follow variations on
genetic framework of the cells. Micellar particles with CD44-
targeting peptides have been developed to efficiently down-
regulate STAT-3 proteins in vitro and in vivo. Although IC50 for
niclosamide in MCF-7 was found to be lower, drug resistant
nature of stem like cancer cells obligated us to use of a higher
concentration (10 mmol/L) to observe significant change in
stem-like cell population. Treatments with lower concentra-
tions did not produce any significant effect in stem-like cell
populations. A decrease in CD44þ cell population positively
correlated with total number of dead cancer cells with "stem-
ness" property. A constant population of cancer cells will have
certain percentage of CD44þ cells and any nonspecific death of

 cancer cells (including cells with stemness characteristics)
would not change the overall percentage of CD44þ cell pop-
ulation. Only a case of specifically high level of cell death in
cancer cell population with stemness property would lead to
overall decrease in the percentage of CD44þ cells. The whole
purpose of the study was looking at stemness genes after CD44
targeting and not to make a simple activity comparison. Pri-
marily because of this, animal experiments were performed
only by using CD44-NIC-Veh as treatment. Downregulation of
all the chosen CSC marker genes was observed in mice xeno-
graft tumors treated with CD44-NIC-Vehs compared with the
control samples Nano-Veh. The results of the study indicate
that CD44-NIC-Veh deactivates STAT3 causing a reduction of
CD44þ/CD24� CSC populations with appropriately followed
gene and protein regulations of "stemness" characteristics. With
these results in hand, our future studies will focus on an in-
depth safety evaluation of these particles and their biodistri-
butive properties in rodents. Although more in-depth animal
studies will be necessary to understand the behavior of each
component in vivo, our results indicated remarkable efficacy
and preliminary safety with an already FDA-approved drug,
which should facilitate its eventual clinical translation.
