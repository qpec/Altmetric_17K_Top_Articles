Summary
Background Government policies can strongly influence migrants’ health. Using a Health in All Policies approach, we 
systematically reviewed evidence on the impact of public policies outside of the health-care system on migrant health.
Methods We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 1, 2017, for 
quantitative studies comparing the health effects of non-health-targeted public policies on migrants with those on a 
relevant comparison population. We searched for articles written in English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, 
French, Spanish, or Portuguese. Qualitative studies and grey literature were excluded. We evaluated policy effects by 
migration stage (entry, integration, and exit) and by health outcome using narrative synthesis (all included studies) 
and random-effects meta-analysis (all studies whose results were amenable to statistical pooling). We summarised 
meta-analysis outcomes as standardised mean difference (SMD, 95% CI) or odds ratio (OR, 95% CI). To assess 
certainty, we created tables containing a summary of the findings according to the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Our study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017076104.
Findings We identified 43 243 potentially eligible records. 46 articles were narratively synthesised and 19 contributed 
to the meta-analysis. All studies were published in high-income countries and examined policies of entry (nine articles) 
and integration (37 articles). Restrictive entry policies (eg, temporary visa status, detention) were associated with poor 
mental health (SMD 0·44, 95% CI 0·13–0·75; I²=92·1%). In the integration phase, restrictive policies in general, and 
specifically regarding welfare eligibility and documentation requirements, were found to increase odds of poor self-
rated health (OR 1·67, 95% CI 1·35–1·98; I²=82·0%) and mortality (1·38, 1·10–1·65; I²=98·9%). Restricted eligibility 
for welfare support decreased the odds of general health-care service use (0·92, 0·85–0·98; I²=0·0%), but did not 
reduce public health insurance coverage (0·89, 0·71–1·07; I²=99·4%), nor markedly affect proportions of people 
without health insurance (1·06, 0·90–1·21; I²=54·9%).
Interpretation Restrictive entry and integration policies are linked to poor migrant health outcomes in high-income 
countries. Efforts to improve the health of migrants would benefit from adopting a Health in All Policies perspective.

Introduction
WHO’s Health in All Policies approach1 to improving 
population health advocates for consideration of the 
health implications of public policies across all sectors. 
This perspective is particularly relevant for the health of 
migrant populations, who are affected by both general 
and migrant-specific policies in the destination country. 
Migrant-specific policies include those pertaining to 
entry (visa and entry criteria), resettlement (dispersal 
policies), short-term integration (language classes), 
long-term integration (anti-discriminatory policies in 
the labour market, democratic participation, and 
citizenship policies), and forced and voluntary return 
migration (deportation procedures). More importantly, 
the steady increase in international migration, from 
approximately 155 million migrants in 2000, to 
258 million in 2017,2 has been met with increasingly 
 
hostile migration policies worldwide, from expanded EU 
border control efforts3 to attempts to rescind legal 
protection granted to undocumented migrants under 
the US Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals 
programme.4 Although such policies have not been 
designed to influence migrant health, their role as social 
determinants of health is incontestable. Previous 
systematic reviews have examined the health effects of 
detention policies5,6 and documentation requirements7 
among specific migrant populations, but have not 
isolated policy effects with comparator populations or 
examined policies at multiple stages of the migration 
process. The aim of this systematic review and meta-
analysis was to comprehensively examine the effect of 
non-health-targeted policies on migrant health.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria

between Jan 1, 2000, and Sept 1, 2017, and written in 
English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, French, 
Spanish, or Portuguese. Search strings were constructed 
in collaboration with a medical librarian (appendix). 
Studies were eligible for inclusion if an international 
migrant population was studied (as per the International 
Organization for Migration definition);8 a policy inter-
vention, not primarily introduced to improve health, was 
implemented at the supranational, national, or local 
level; a relevant comparison group was used (ie, between 
intervention and control groups, between countries or 
regions, or before and after policy implementation within 
a target population); and a health outcome was assessed. 
All quantitative and mixed-methods designs were 
considered. Qualitative studies were excluded as our aim 
was to quantify policy health effects. We did not search 
grey literature sources. Forward and backward citation 
searching (ie, identification of newer publications citing 
a reference included in our review and previous 
publications cited within an included study) and 
consultations with topic experts were used in parallel to 
identify additional articles for inclusion. Article titles and 
abstracts were imported into the Covidence systematic-
review online management tool. Review team members 
(SPJ, HH, and ACD) alternated review duties for each 
paper. Two reviewers independently screened titles and 
abstracts, retrieved full texts of potentially relevant 
articles, and assessed article eligibility for inclusion, 
while discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer.
Statistical analysis
Review team members (SPJ, HH, and ACD) extracted 
the data and assessed risk of bias of included papers. 
Extracted data included sample characteristics of 
exposure and control groups (ie, sample size, participants’ 
age, gender, origin, and reason for migration), policy 
measures, health outcomes, control variables, details of 
the analytical approaches used in studies, types of 
outcome measures, and measures of association and 
statistical significance (data extraction sheet available 
upon request from authors). Risk of bias was assessed 
with a modified version of the Effective Public Health 
Practice Project quality assessment tool (appendix).9,10 
Authors were contacted if add 
itional study information 
was required. 
Our analytical approach entailed narrative synthesis of 
all included studies and meta-analysis of poolable 
estimates. Narrative synthesis was done according to the 
Economic and Social Research Council guidelines.11 We 
categorised policies according to the Migration Phases 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The extent to which health policies are effective in influencing 
the health of migrants and natives alike has been investigated, 
yet evidence on the health effects of other public policies 
among migrants is scarce. To prepare for this systematic review 
and meta-analysis we used expert recommendations and 
searched the PubMed and Embase databases from Jan 1, 2000, 
to July 15, 2017, for English-language review articles that 
examined the impact of various public policies on the health of 
migrants. Search terms included “policy”, “migrants”, 
“refugees”, and “asylum seekers”. We identified three relevant 
systematic reviews, all published within the last decade, which 
found increased odds of poor mental health for asylum seekers 
exposed to detention and undocumented migrants exposed to 
restrictive (anti-immigrant) policy in the integration phase. 
Policies that instituted strict documentation requirements were 
shown to reduce migrant health-care access. However, these 
reviews considered few aspects of public policy outside of the 
health-care sector, often did not assess the quality of included 
studies, and did not assess health among people not exposed 
to such policies as a comparison group. Previous narrative 
reviews have highlighted the importance of considering the 
social determinants of health among migrants.
Added value of this study
This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a 
comprehensive overview of the impact of public policies on a 
range of migrant health outcomes. All peer-reviewed evidence 
came from high-income countries and primarily focused on 
integration policies, with scarce evidence of the effect of entry 
or exit policies on migrant health. Our findings highlight a 
mental health disadvantage in refugees with temporary 
residence protection and stringent reception upon arrival; 
decreased health-insurance enrolment and health-service use 
stemming from restrictive welfare policies; and poor self-rated 
health and psychological health among non-citizen migrants 
due to documentation-related and general integration-related 
fears.
Implications of all the available evidence 
Migration policies are key social determinants of health and can 
affect health directly, through access to care, and indirectly, 
through social and economic pathways. This review highlights 
the capacity of policy mechanisms to affect migrant health 
negatively and perpetuate migrant health inequities. 
These effects have yet to be studied in low-income and 
middle-income contexts and across other dimensions of 
migration policy, such as educational and housing 
opportunities and deportation and exit procedures. Based on 
our findings, we recommend the use of a Health in All Policies 
approach, which considers the health effects of all 
migrant-oriented policies. More inclusive approaches towards 
integration of migrants into their host societies, rather than the 
enforcement of stringent reception and border control efforts, 
is likely to have a positive effect on migrants’ health and life 
opportunities. Such policies are also more in line with the spirit 
of international agreements made to respect and uphold 
universal human rights.

Framework,12 focusing on the entry, integration, and exit 
phases. Policies were further classified by generosity—ie, 
whether migrants’ access to health-promoting resources 
and opportunities was increased (generous) or limited 
(restrictive) by the policy.13 Tabulation and modified vote-
counting (ie, assessing frequency and direction of effects 
across studies while accounting for risk of bias) was used 
as per the Economic and Social Research Council 
guidance11,14 and was paired with subanalyses to explore 
the heterogeneity of health effects by migrant population 
and context, when possible.
We did the random-effects meta-analysis by policy 
domain and health outcome when results were amenable 
to statistical pooling,15 using the metan command in 
Stata version 13.16 Conceptually similar health outcomes 
assessed with different measures (eg, different indicators 
of mental health) were meta-analysed together to quantify 
policy effects on broad categories of health. We grouped 
outcomes based on whether they were originally reported 
as dichotomous, which we summarised as odds ratios 
(ORs; 95% CI), or continuous, which we summarised as 
standardised mean differences (SMDs; 95% CI). Some 
measures were dichotomised or transformed from risk 
ratios to ORs to facilitate inclusion in meta-analysis.17 
Results were displayed in Forest plots with I² statistics to 
indicate the proportion of true heterogeneity between 
studies from the total observed variation.18 We used 
the 
Grading 
of 
Recommendations 
Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to 
summarise and assess the certainty of findings 
concerning the direction of the effect by outcome.19,20 
Sensitivity analyses were done to test the robustness of 
overall findings by excluding studies with high risk of 
bias,18 and to explore heterogeneity of health effects 
by excluding specific migrant populations (eg, older 
migrants [ie, aged ≥65 years], child migrants, non-citizen 
migrants, and undocumented migrants).
Our study was registered with PROSPERO, number 
CRD42017076104.

Results
The database search yielded 43 243 records. After the 
removal of 11 715 duplicates, 31 232 records were excluded 
by date, language, or publication type, or on the basis of 
their title or abstract. Of the remaining 296 potentially 
relevant full-text articles, 251 did not meet the eligibility 
criteria. One record was included through citation 
searching. A final 46 articles were included in the narrative 
synthesis,21–66 of which two reported on the same study,48,58 
and 19 qualified for meta-analysis22,25,29,30,34–37,41,45,47–51,53,60,62,65 
(figure 1; table 1; appendix). All included studies 
were done in high-income contexts, and examined the 
health-related impact of entry (eight studies)32,35,47,48,53,57–59,61 
and integration (37 studies)21–31,33,34,36–46,49–52,54–56,60,62–66 policies 
(table 1); no study investigated exit policies. Most studies 
pertaining to entry had high risk of bias, while integration-
related studies generally had low and moderate risks 
of bias. Findings from the meta-analysis and narrative 
synthesis are described by policy type (entry or integration), 
then by health outcome (table 2).
Entry policies were examined in eight studies primarily 
in relation to mental health,32,35,47,48,53,57,58 but also to birth 
outcomes,61 mortality,59 and health-care access.35,57 Seven 
studies35,47,48,53,57,59,61 were cross-sectional and two32,58 had 
cohort designs. Study contexts included Australia,35,48,57,58

Canada and Spain,61 and refugee sites in multiple 
countries.59 Most studies examined refugees or asylum 
seekers, and two32,53 specifi
 cally studied asylum-seeking 
children.
Meta-analysis indicated that restrictive entry policies 
were associated with poor mental health outcomes 
(ie, psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and post-
traumatic stress disorder; SMD 0·44, 95% CI 0·13–0·75, 
I²=92·1%; figure 2),35,47,48,53 specifically with regard to 
temporary (vs permanent) protection visas, restrictive 
(vs open) border control, and reduced (vs freer) mobility 
in detainment. Despite high risk of bias and hetero-
geneous policy contexts and analytical methods across 
most entry policy studies, narrative synthesis largely 
supported these findings (appendix).35,47,53,57,58
Restrictive entry policies were associated with 
decreased odds of low birthweight among migrants in 
one study,61 perhaps because of positive health selection. 
However, a high-risk-of-bias study59 of forced migration 
to refugee camps, which might be less likely to be 
affected by health selection than labour-based migration, 
revealed decreased crude and under-5 mortality with 
increased (ie, generous) spending on refugee protection 
and assistance programmes. Other evidence with 
high risk of bias showed increased57 or similar levels 
of difficulties35 in obtaining access to health care 
among refugees granted temporary versus permanent 
protection visas.
The 37 identified studies pertaining to the integration 
stage of migration were subdivided into categories of 
general integration, welfare, and documentation policies 
(table 1). Studies of general integration policies26,31,34,42,45,46 
considered the broad approaches adopted by different 
European destination countries, using the Migrant 
Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) to categorise policy 
contexts (inclusive, assimilationist, and exclusionist).67 
Studies on migrant-specific welfare policies in the 
USA23,25,28-30,36-39,41,43,44,49-51,65,66  and in Germany27 assessed efforts 
to curtail non-citizen welfare  service use (including public 
health insurance) via waiting times,25,27,28,30,36–39,41,43,44,49,50,65,66 
cost barriers,41,43,51 and burden of proof for eligibility,23,29,56 
with controlled before–after and difference-in-difference 
designs. Finally, studies of documentation policies 
published in the USA,21,22,24,33,52,54,60,62–64 Italy,55 and South 
Korea40 examined efforts to institute a burden of proof for 
legal residence, to be used for employment and law-
enforcement purposes, while also considering mig 
rants’ 
experiences of fear and discrimination.
Meta-analysis of integration studies indicated that 
more restrictive policies across the three subcategories 
were associated with increased odds of poor self-rated 
health (OR 1·67, 95% CI 1·35–1·98, I²=82·0%; 
figure 3a).22,45,62 Exclusion of evidence with high risk of 
bias did not affect this finding (1·68, 1·31–2·05, 
I²=84·8%).62 Meta-analysis of MIPEX-based general 
policy approaches found that the odds of poor self-rated 
health were increased among migrants in assimilationist

1·99–2·78, I²=0·0%) contexts relative to inclusive 
contexts.45 Narrative synthesis of studies with low risk of 
bias supported this gradient of poor self-rated health by 
increasingly 
restrictive 
general 
policy 
contexts.26,31 
However, examination of both welfare and documentation 
policies revealed mixed associations with self-rated 
health (appendix).22,39,62,63
Similarly, relative to inclusive approaches to integration 
(as per MIPEX), migrant mortality risks were elevated by 
more restrictive general policy approaches (OR 1·38, 
95% CI 1·10–1·65, I²=98·9%; figure 3b), specifically in 
exclusionist settings (2·14, 1·71–2·57, I²=89·0%), among 
both men (2·45, 1·74–3·17, I²=89·4%) and women 
(1·80, 0·78–2·81, I²=94·0%).34 A decreased risk of 
all-cause mortality was observed in assimilationist 
contexts (0·73, 0·58–0·89, I²=96·7%) and among women 
specifically (0·69, 0·52–0·85, I²=91·0%), possibly attrib-
utable to variation in health-care access and quality 
within these policy classifications.34
Subcategories of integration policies were found to have 
mixed effects on mental health. With inadequate data for 
meta-analysis, narrative synthesis of general integration 
policies revealed that all migrants had worse health than 
natives,42,46 with the greatest mental health gap in 
exclusionist contexts, followed by assimilationist, and 
finally, inclusive contexts (as per the MIPEX score).46 
Protective documentation policy was shown to safeguard 
undocumented migrants against poor mental health in 
robust63 and weak52 studies alike, while evidence with 
moderate and high risk of bias for the mental health 
effects of restrictive documentation policies was mixed.33,62
Several studies also assessed the effects of welfare 
and documentation policy on health insurance and

(ie, Medicaid) enrol 
ment (OR 0·89, 95·% CI 0·71–1·07, 
I²=99·4%; figure 4A) in the meta-analysis.25,29,37,49,50 
However, post-hoc analysis that excluded non-working-
age migrants showed a reduction in the odds estimate—
albeit not significant—for enrolment (0·80, 0·50–1·10, 
I²=99·8%), suggesting a potential policy effect for some 
migrants.25,29,37 In line with welfare policies’ contingency 
on citizenship, post-hoc analysis similarly found lower 
odds of enrolment among non-citizens than among 
their naturalised peers (0·87, 0·74–1·00, I²=96·3%).25,29,49 
Synthesis of studies with low and moderate risk of bias 
revealed mixed effects of heterogeneous welfare policies 
on Medicaid enrolment in diverse migrant populations 
(appendix).25,29,37,38,49,50,56,66
Welfare restrictions likewise did not appear to affect 
odds of being uninsured (ie, lacking any form of health 
insurance, public or private) as an unqualified migrant 
relative to qualified individuals (OR 1·06, 95% CI 
0·90–1·21, I²=54·9%; figure 4B), as per our meta-
analysis.36,49,51 Narrative synthesis of studies with low and 
moderate risk of bias showed increases in uninsured 
status for women38 and children,38,44,51 or no change in 
insurance status among women,39 children,39 and older 
people.49 This discrepancy could be attributable to age 
hetero 
geneity. Post-hoc meta-analysis excluding children 
and older migrants revealed that increased welfare 
restrictions did not lead to working-age migrants 
becoming uninsured (0·97, 0·80–1·13, I²=49·7%).36 State-
level policies in the USA that guaranteed migrants’ right 
to public insurance were mostly unsuccessful in buffering 
insurance loss relative to states without supplementary 
insurance,38,39 with only one study with moderate risk of 
bias showing a state-protective effect against insurance 
loss after welfare reform.36
Restrictive welfare policies were also associated with 
reduced migrant use of health-care services (OR 0·92, 
95% CI 0·85–0·98, I²=0·0%; figure 4C).60,65 In the 
narrative synthesis, studies with low39 and greater23,60,64,65 
risk of bias showed that restrictive welfare and 
documentation policy discouraged adult,23,64 maternal,39,60 
and older migrant service use,65 but not children’s 
use.39,60,64 This was perhaps because migrant parents were 
more likely to seek care for their children than them-
selves.64 A study with high risk of bias on documentation 
policy also showed decreased service use in paediatric 
emergency wards, counteracted by increased acute 
admissions.24 This was in line with low-risk-of-bias 
evidence showing increased societal health expenditures 
in Germany following the postponement of asylum-
seeker and refugee welfare eligibility,27 suggesting that 
restricting health-care access can delay treatment of 
existing health issues and ultimately force migrants to 
seek more costly acute care.

after the introduction of federal welfare restrictions. 
Evidence in the narrative synthesis was mixed with 
regard to the effects of this state-level welfare policy30,36,41,43 
and of documentation policies54 (appendix), alluding to 
individual patterns of prenatal-care use dependent on 
one’s nativity and state residency.
For birth outcomes, one study with low risk of bias 
showed that welfare restrictions were associated with 
increased infant mortality among Mexican immigrants 
in the USA compared with natives.28 These restrictions 
did not appear to affect low birthweight (moderate risk of 
bias),36,41 except by state-level differences in supplementary 
welfare programmes.36 Finally, a robust Italian study on 
documentation policy granting legal rights to previously 
undocumented women indicated decreased odds of low 
birthweight in their children.55
Given the observational nature of the included studies, 
our findings are largely reported with low or very low 
certainty (table 2). More restrictive entry policies were 
shown to increase levels of poor mental health, albeit 
with very low certainty given the predominance of studies 
with high risk of bias. Restrictive policies in the 
integration phase were associated with decreased self-
rated health, once again with very low certainty, given the 
studies’ risks of bias and imprecision (ie, null effects for 
documentation policies). However, we have moderate 
certainty that increasingly restrictive general policies of 
integration increase migrant mortality—inconsistencies 
in these effects are probably attributable to differences in 
the contexts and migrant populations studied within 
each MIPEX integration category. Mental health was 
shown to worsen with more restrictive policies in the 
integration phase, a finding we report with low certainty 
given some imprecision in the estimates. Restrictive 
welfare policies were associated with decreased public 
health insurance and increased proportion of uninsured 
(low certainty). Inconsistencies in these findings appear 
to be partly attributable to age differences, with working-
age migrants more likely to lose public health insurance 
but less likely to be uninsured overall than children and 
older migrants. Finally, we have very low certainty that 
more restrictive policies in the integration phase 
decreased health-care service use among migrants. Study 
findings differed by age group, with children’s health-
care service use less affected than that of adult and older 
migrants, and by service type, with decreases in primary 
care use countered by heightened use of acute care.
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the 
effect of non-health-targeted public policies on migrant 
health. The included studies focused exclusively on 
policies in high-income countries related to the entry and 
integration phases of the migration journey.
We found evidence for negative effects on mental health 
in relation to restricted entry, including policies on 
temporary protection, detention, and restricted asylum

reception. Studies also revealed a gradient in health 
inequalities (poor self-rated health and mortality) between 
natives and migrants by severity of restrictive policy. 
Together, these findings suggest that the use of restrictive 
entry and integration policies should be avoided. If these 
policies are to be used in exceptional circumstances, they 
should be implemented alongside strategies to mitigate 
mental and physical health risks, and to protect the health 
of refugee migrant groups as per the international 
responsibilities of nations and states. We also found that 
increased risks of poor mental health in settings with 
strict documentation requirements were mirrored by the 
protective mental health effects of generous docu-
mentation policy. This implies that policy makers should 
not only aim to avoid poor health outcomes by reducing 
the implementation of harmful policies, but actively work 
to improve migrant health through the maintenance of 
generous policy efforts. Finally, there was conflicting 
evidence that restricting eligibility for welfare support 
resulted in reduced health insurance coverage. Yet, 
evidence of policy effects on specific types of health-care 
use were more consistent, whereby migrants received 
increased inadequate prenatal care, had reduced perinatal 
outcomes, and increased the use of acute care services, 
probably because individuals delayed care for concerns 
regarding eligibility and affordability. These factors can 
amplify long-term health-care costs, thus providing an 
economic incentive for policy revisions. Alternatively, 
policies ensuring earlier engagement in primary and 
routine health-care services for migrants would be both 
health-promoting and cost-mitigating.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and 
meta-analysis to examine the effects of non-health-targeted 
public policies on migrant health. Although previous 
research has found health inequalities among migrants as 
a result of societal and institutional factors—many of 
which are affected by public policies68—little has been 
done to isolate the effects of these policies on migrant 
health. Furthermore, comprehensive evidence on policies 
across country contexts and migrant populations has been 
lacking. Our review aimed to summarise research across 
these dimensions and revealed a strong regional dispersal 
of research on specific migrant policy domains. The 
Australian lit 
erature largely focused on entry criteria 
among asylum seekers,35,48,57,58 reflecting ongoing inter-
national criticism of its detainment procedures.69 Most 
European studies centred on general integration efforts, 
particularly labour-market participation.27,31,34,42,45,46 Research 
from the USA prioritised documentation status and 
general attitudes towards migrants,21,22,24,33,52,54,60,62-64 as well 
as policy changes that restricted migrant welfare 
benefits.23,25,28–30,36–39,41,43,44,49-51,56,65,66
Our review has several strengths, including its 
systematic and comprehensive approach to synthesising 
all available evidence from the scientific peer-reviewed 
 
literature.14 We also considered the adequacy of the 
counterfactuals or comparators used to estimate policy 
effects.70,71 However, our decision to exclude grey 
literature and restrict our search languages by our 
linguistic competencies might have excluded some 
relevant policy evaluations, particularly those outside of 
the European or North American contexts. The certainty 
of evidence was largely affected by our reliance on 
observational studies which often do not employ more 
advanced analytical 
strategies 
found in 
natural 
experiment designs to identify policy effects.70,71 The

heterogeneity of migrant popu 
lations and policies, 
including whether policy intro 
ductions or withdrawals 
were assessed,72 and the heterogeneity in comparators, 
health outcomes, country contexts, and study designs, 
constrained our ability to do meta-analyses. Inadequate 
reporting of policy implem 
entation73 and statistical 
results further limited potential narrative synthesis. 
Despite these challenges, we were able to synthesise 
and meta-analyse findings related to entry and 
integration policies.74 However, evidence was sparse for 
exit policies. Additionally, no included studies assessed 
return or circular migration, preventing assess 
ment of 
these migration phases.75 Other frame 
works, such as 
the lifecourse perspective,76 could also have been used to 
structure the review or provide alternative insights into 
our findings.
The Edinburgh Declaration on Migration, Ethnicity, 
Race, and Health77 has advocated for more empirical 
evidence to understand and tackle inequalities. Our 
review 
reveals 
that 
non-health-targeted 
policies 
contribute to the production of health inequalities 
among migrants. Given the rapid nature of policy 
change, future research should aim to update the work 
summarised here to maintain an up-to-date evidence 
base on the health effects of public policy in migrants. 
Substantial study design limitations persist, with 
shortages of natural experiment studies that use robust 
analytical 
approaches 
to 
isolate 
policy 
effects 
(eg, difference-in-difference analyses with appropriate 
counterfactuals); of low-income and middle-income 
study contexts and international comparisons of such 
policies; and of health research on resettlement, short-
term integration, and voluntary or involuntary return 
policies. These gaps should also be addressed in future 
research efforts (panel).
The findings of this systematic review and meta-
analysis provide empirical evidence that non-health-
specific public policies can affect migrant health, 
supporting the importance not only of adopting a Health 
in All Policies paradigm, but ultimately embracing a 
human-rights framework that draws attention to the 
rights of migrants under international law.78,79 The 
human-rights framework considers health as an 
interdependent human right, whereby action to support 
some rights could reinforce others—eg, action to provide 
secure shelter is an important component of ensuring 
the right to health. Restrictive migration policies (through 
detention, reduced access to welfare, and so on), 
therefore, do not only appear to cause health harms, as 
our findings show, but fundamentally undermine human 
rights more broadly. Although international law provides 
a supportive institutional context for improving the 
health of migrants, its enforcement to meet human-
rights obligations is weak. Achieving healthy migration 
policies requires an appreciation of the conflicting policy 
interests, with often hostile domestic views on migration 
being weighed up against potential improvements to the 
health and human rights of migrants.80,81 While 
improving the evidence base is an important part of 
improving migrants’ health, political action is also 
ultimately required.

Future research directions
• 
Research should evaluate the effects of non-health-targeted policies on migrant 
health in low-income and middle-income countries, as the existing evidence base is 
derived from high-income countries.
• 
More studies focusing on the health effects of resettlement (dispersal), short-term 
integration (language training), and involuntary return (deportation) policies are 
needed.
• 
The differential health impacts of policies targeted at the social determinants of 
health, on migrants compared with non-migrants, remain poorly investigated; these 
include major macroeconomic, education, employment, social security, and housing 
policies which might be expected to affect migrants more than native populations.
• 
Consideration of the medium-term and long-term health effects of policies, as well as 
whether effects differ amongst migrant subgroups, including by gender, age, 
socioeconomic position, and reason for migration, is needed.
• 
Studies should evaluate the health effects of potentially desirable policies oriented 
towards anti-discrimination, citizenship acquisition, or democratic participation; 
such studies could inform the implementation of compensatory government policies.
• 
Further research on entry policies is needed for non-refugee migrants in relation to 
visa and selection criteria to understand their long-term health effects and how such 
policies might impact health selection.
Methodological considerations
• 
Studies should attempt to consider how best to create a counterfactual for 
assessment of causal effects.
• 
Adequate reporting of policy implementation and its context is essential to ensure 
results can be interpreted meaningfully.
• 
Further efforts should be made to theorise the potential mechanisms at play between 
policies and the specific health outcomes under consideration—when possible, 
empirical analysis should investigate these mechanisms.
• 
Data linkage might provide new opportunities for studying the health of migrants in a 
robust and efficient way, but has been underused thus far.
