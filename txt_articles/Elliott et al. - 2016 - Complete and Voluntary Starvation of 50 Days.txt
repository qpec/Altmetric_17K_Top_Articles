Introduction
A 34–year-old male presented for general examination on day 
49 of a 50-day self-imposed fast, seeking approval to continue 
his fasting behavior. During this period, the patient reported 
only consuming water, tea, coffee (with no milk or sugar), and 
a daily multivitamin tablet (Centrum Performance; Pfizer).
Patient history prior to fasting behavior revealed a family 
history of obesity and the presence of pathologies related to body 
mass. Personal history involved an oscillating mass between 85 
and 134 kg over a 10-year period. At the start of fasting, the 
patient reported body mass as 96.8 kg, and 29.2% body fat, as 
recorded by a personal bioelectrical impedance device. History 
following the onset of fasting behavior was unremarkable, but 
included severe abdominal cramps between days 7 and 21 of 
fasting, development and frequent occurrence of vasovagal syn-
cope on transition from sitting to standing, and the near-cessa-
tion of fecal movement. Eructation frequency was significantly 
increased. Self-reported physical activity and mobility was 
reduced, but not prevented; this participant was not bedridden. 
Substantial water and coffee intake was noted (8–12 cups of cof-
fee daily and 2–3 bottles of water daily). As expected, body mass 
loss during fasting was severe and noticeable (Fig. 1).
Initial examination showed maintenance of motor and 
cranial nerve function. Resting metabolic rate (30 minutes 
by indirect calorimetry) was 1626 kcal day−1. During the 
30-minute rest period, ECG and blood pressure were 
monitored. Resting ECG appeared morphologically normal, 
patient was bradycardic (52 bpm) and notably hyperten-
sive (150/78 mmHg). Body composition was measured by 
whole-body air displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod) 
as 19.8% body fat, while height was 180.9 cm and mass 
was 75.4 kg, with a BMI of 23.5 kg m−1, all recorded on

AbstrAct: A 34-year-old obese male (96.8 kg; BMI, 30.2 kg m−1) volitionally undertook a 50-day fast with the stated goal of losing body mass. 
 
During this time, only tea, coffee, water, and a daily multivitamin were consumed. Severe and linear loss of body mass is recorded during these 50 days 
(final 75.4 kg; BMI, 23.5 kg m−1). A surprising resilience to effects of fasting on activity levels and physical function is noted. Plasma samples are suggestive 
of early impairment of liver function, and perturbations to cardiovascular dynamics are also noted. One month following resumption of feeding behavior, 
body weight was maintained (75.0 kg; BMI, 23.4 kg m−1). Evidence-based decision-making with the fasting or hunger striking patient is limited by a lack of 
evidence. This case report suggests that total body mass, not mass lost, may be a key observation in clinical decision-making during fasting and starvation.

calibrated laboratory devices. Sum of four skinfolds1 was 
30.0 mm, approximately half of that of a reference popula-
tion of similarly aged males (62 ± 25 mm, aged 30–39). It 
was visually noted that subcutaneous fat in the abdominal 
region was still present, despite severe losses in the periph-
eral limbs, protruding ribs, and lack of prominent chest and 
shoulder musculature. A grade 1/2 panniculus resulting from 
rapid abdominal adipose loss was present (Fig. 2). During a 
six-minute walk test, this individual covered 342 m, which 
was below expected performance for a healthy male adult.2 
A mild scoliosis was observed while walking; however, it is 
unclear if this is related to fasting.
Venous blood was taken for serum markers of metabo-
lism, liver, and renal function. Results are given in Table 1. 
Noteworthy findings include plasma glucose of 3.1 mmol L−1 
and alkaline phosphatase of 36 U L−1. Total bilirubin was 
19 µmol L−1, direct bilirubin was 7 µmol L−1. Uric acid was 
620 µmol L−1.
Urine was straw colored, lacked sediment, and was 
noticeably sweet in aroma. Rapid dipstick analysis (Multistix 
2161; Siemens) was negative for blood glucose, contained trace 
proteins, and indicated urine pH of below 5. Urine was highly 
ketonuric (.16 mmol L−1).
one Month Past breaking of Fast
One month following initial presentation, the patient returned 
for follow-up examination during which body composition, 
resting metabolic rate, urine, and venous blood were recorded. 
Resumption of feeding initially involved liquids such as 
vege 
table soups, with the resumption of solid foods three 
days following breaking of fast. Days 3–5 involved one solid 
meal per day, with 2–3 solid meals during days 5–7, and the 
resumption of three solid food meals per day for 7 days fol-
lowing breaking of fast. In the following 23 days, diet was

reported to be of caffeine and alcohol free, low carbohydrate 
 
(a piece of bread every 1–3 days), and high servings of fruit and 
vegetables. Self-estimation of diet by volume was 20% animal 
protein (chicken and fish) and 80% fruit or vegetables; validated, 
quantifiable measures of intake and caloric content are not 
available. Heart rate remained bradycardic at rest (48 bpm), and 
blood pressure was notably reduced (132/78). Metabolic rate was 
reduced (1413 kcal day−1), and body composition was unchanged 
(75.0 kg; BMI, 23.4 kg m−1; 16.1% fat mass). Urinary ketones 
were reduced, but not removed. Normal fecal movements were 
reported to begin seven days following resumption of feeding. 
Blood biochemistry returned to within normal range, with the 
exception of direct bilirubin (Table 1). The six-minute walk test 
was repeated, and the patient covered 401 m.
discussion
Clinical examinations and research models reporting such 
severe starvation are absent in modern literature. Clear ethi-
cal barriers preclude structured research into the physiology of 
such stimuli. It is noteworthy, therefore, in this case study that 
moderate physical function appears maintained at day 49, as 
assessed by general observation and results of the six-minute 
walk test. Frommel et al.3 suggested that fasting in healthy 
lean individuals was well tolerated until 18% of body mass was 
lost; the patient reported here lost 20.7% of body mass with-
out substantial loss of function. One prior report of long-term 
fasting in obese individuals for 30–40 days demonstrated body 
mass losses between 10.6% and 20.5%, but does not report 
on function of individuals.4 It seems self-apparent and sup-
ported by this limited evidence, such that the starting mass 
is a key variable in survival of extreme fasting, and not the 
amount of loss. This patient started fasting while obese and 
ended his fast when anthropometric variables were within the 
targeted ranges for the general population. Indeed, among the 
few (nonpublished) examples of complete fasting and mortal-
ity,5 patients were frail between 30 and 50 days, and death was 
noted to occur between days 43 and 70, which this case study 
has reached without obvious or significant frailty occurring. 
These findings were reported in nonoverweight individuals.
Current World Medical Association guidelines prioritize 
autonomy, recommending nonintervention in fasting to the point 
of harm and/or death, if the patient makes a written informed 
statement of intent.5 Lack of research into this field precludes 
evidence-based decision-making or advice. In the limited light 
of this case study and historic data of fasting in obesity,4 it is 
tempting to suggest that guidelines to physicians for advice to 
the fasting individual reflect body mass, and specifically mass 
of adiposity at start of fasting behavior. Survival in starva-
tion is ultimately governed by physics, the calories available to 
maintain metabolic function. Availability of adipose tissue for 
metabolic usage may thus delay the catastrophic degradation of 
muscular protein, increasing survival time.
That said, small animal models reveal organ-spe-
cific effects of starvation, with loss of liver and gut size 
and function noted after only four to six days.6 Functional 
damage to digestive organs cannot be ruled out, and indeed, 
the elevated direct bilirubin is suggestive of reduced liver 
filtration. Of concern, direct bilirubin remained elevated 
30 days post breaking of fast. Elevated uric acid is likely due 
to reduced kidney filtration, as has been reported in caloric 
 
restriction previously.7
Further, hypertension was an unexpected finding. This 
finding is counter to one of the few published examinations 
of cardiology in severe starvation, where bradycardia and 
hypotension (∼20 mmHg below fed state) were noted in juve-
nile pigs following 29 days of complete starvation.8 The por-
cine heart contains several structural differences relative to 
the human, most related to bipedal vs. quadrupedal stance.9 
As frequent syncope was also noted in that our case study, it 
is plausible that dysregulated autonomic regulation of blood 
pressure underlies the observed hypertension. Blood pressure 
was measured in a supine position, increasing venous return 
in the human relative to standing position. Simple Frank–
Starling mechanics combined with a failure of autonomic reg-
ulation may thus explain elevated blood pressure. Thus, it is 
tempting to suggest that differences observed may be species 
dependent; however, this is highly speculative on a single case 
study. Further, long-lasting cardiovascular deficits were noted 
in the above porcine model on refeeding, as well as chronically 
following experimental conclusion.8 As death resulting from 
starvation often occurs via cardiovascular complications, this 
elevated blood pressure during fast is key to note; this should 
be carefully monitered in fasting individuals.
Caloric restriction and weight loss in overweight or 
obese individuals is often associated with subsequent regain 
of weight.10,11 Having access to this case study 30 days follow-
ing resumption of feeding was of interest due to a chance to 
examine any occurrence of such a rebound effect. It is of inter-
est to note that this was not seen here; however, future gains 
in weight cannot be ruled out.
Here, we report the maintenance of physical function 
of an individual after 49 days of complete fast. This report 
does not indicate support for such behavioral choices, and the 
projections of metabolic energy provision by starting adipos-
ity assume no other perturbations to homeostasis, such as 
impaired immune response, liver and renal function, or car-
diovascular events. Such a voluntary behavioral choice is dif-
ficult to support.
