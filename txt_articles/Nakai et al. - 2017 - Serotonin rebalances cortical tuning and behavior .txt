Serotonin is a critical modulator of cortical function, and its metabolism is defective in autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) brain. How serotonin metabolism regulates cortical physiology and contributes to the pathological and
behavioral symptoms of ASD remains unknown. We show that normal serotonin levels are essential for the
maintenance of neocortical excitation/inhibition balance, correct sensory stimulus tuning, and social behavior.
Conversely, low serotonin levels in 15q dup mice (a model for ASD with the human 15q11-13 duplication) result
in impairment of the same phenotypes. Restoration of normal serotonin levels in 15q dup mice revealed the
reversibility of a subset of ASD-related symptoms in the adult. These findings suggest that serotonin may have
therapeutic potential for discrete ASD symptoms.
INTRODUCTION
Copy number variation (CNV) is one of the most prevalent genomic
abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (1–3). We previ-
ously generated a 15q11-13 duplication model mouse corresponding
to one of the most cytogenetically frequent CNVs in ASD (4, 5) and
showed that paternal duplication (15q dup) mice displayed ASD-like
behaviors including poor social communication and interaction, be-
havioral inflexibility (6, 7), and abnormalities of cortical spines and
cerebellar functions (8, 9). We also found a reduction in the level of
serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] and in the volume of the
dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which contains a large proportion of
5-HT neurons providing serotonergic projections to cortical fore-
brain regions (7, 10). A decreased rate of 5-HT synthesis in develop-
mental stages has been reported in the central nervous system of
ASD patients (11), suggesting a hyposerotonergic state. The 5-HT
system also has abnormal modulatory effects on cognitive function
in ASD (12), and behavioral abnormalities are thought to result from
5-HT–impaired neural networks, although direct evidence is lacking
(13). Excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance is suggested to be disrupted in
ASD (3, 14), and enhancement of the g-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–
ergic system rescues physiological and behavioral deficits in ASD
model mice(15–17). However, the hyposerotonergic state and its phys-
iological and behavioral consequences (particularly for cortical E/I bal-
ance and social behavior) remain unexamined in ASD model mice.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
15q dup mice have reduced excitatory transmission and
glucose metabolism in the DRN
We initially measured the electrophysiological properties of 5-HT
neurons in the DRN of wild-type (WT) and 15q dup mice. 5-HT neu-
rons were identified by their firing patterns and action potential
shapes, along with subsequent immunohistochemistry with a trypto-
phan hydroxylase (Tph) antibody (Fig. 1A). The resting membrane
potential of 15q dup neurons was hyperpolarized compared with that
of WT neurons (Fig. 1B), whereas other properties related to action
potential generation did not differ (table S1) and dendritic complexity
of 5-HT neurons was unchanged (fig. S1). We also recorded sponta-
neous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) from DRN neurons.
The sEPSC amplitudes in 15q dup neurons were smaller in both ven-
tromedial DRN (vmDRN) and lateral wing DRN (lwDRN), whereas
sEPSC frequencies showed no changes (Fig. 1, C to E). We assessed
DRN activity in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
of regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) with a 2-[18F]fluoro-
2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) probe. The global brain activity of 15q
dup mice did not significantly differ from that of WT mice (Fig. 1, F
and G), but a voxel-based statistical parametric mapping analysis re-
vealed lower rCGM in the DRN of 15q dup mice (Fig. 1, H, J, L, and
M). We also observed increased rCGMs in the hippocampus and an-
terior cingulate cortex (Fig. 1, H to M), which may reflect elevated
levels of anxiety in 15q dup mice. Together, these results suggest that
the hyposerotonergic state in 15q dup mice is caused by overt low ac-
tivity of the DRN and may be explained in part by 5-HT neurons re-
ceiving a weaker drive from afferent excitatory inputs.
Sensory tuning is impaired in 15q dup somatosensory cortex
barrel field
The reduced DRN activity led us to investigate its impact on down-
stream cortical areas. We recorded from the somatosensory cortex
where the circuit organization is well known to be affected by 5-HT
level (18), and patients with ASD show poor response reliability in
sensory cortical areas (19, 20). Using a transgenic mouse expressing
GCaMP7, we measured the reliability of sensory-evoked response
tuning in the somatosensory cortex barrel field (S1BF) in 15q dup mice

 by transcranial calcium imaging (Fig. 2A). The size of the peak re-
sponse area of the principal barrel to single whisker stimulation (prin-
cipal area) was unchanged, whereas that of the responded area
(surrounding area) was significantly larger in 15q dup mice (Fig. 2,
B and C). Moreover, the peak amplitude was smaller, and the percent-
age of its decay slope was slower in the principal area in 15q dup mice
(Fig. 2, D to F), indicating that 15q dup mice have degraded respon-
siveness to the principal whisker. To evaluate the responsiveness of a
single neuron to whisker stimuli, we performed in vivo patch-clamp
recordings of layer 2/3 (L2/3) regular spiking neurons of the S1BF (Fig.
2, G and H). In 15q dup regular spiking neurons, firing properties were
normal (table S2), but the amplitudes of surrounding whisker re-
sponses (S1Ws) were larger than those in WT mice, whereas the
amplitudes of principal whisker responses (PWs) were comparable

 (Fig. 2I). In line with the calcium imaging data, the tuning of whisker
selectivity was less evident in 15q dup S1BF (Fig. 2J).
15q dup S1BF has fewer inhibitory synapses and L2/3
pyramidal neurons exhibit intrinsic hyperexcitability
Local inhibition is required for specific responses to whisker stimula-
tion (21, 22). Therefore, we examined whether inhibition is impaired
in 15q dup S1BF. The densities of several types of interneurons in the
S1BF were comparable between genotypes (fig. S2). We next analyzed
inhibitory synapses by immunostaining for vesicular GABA trans-
porter (VGAT) (Fig. 3A). VGAT puncta density was reduced specif-
ically in L2/3 (Fig. 3, B and E) but not in L4 or L6 of 15q dup S1BF (Fig.
3, C and D). On the other hand, the density of L2/3 excitatory synapses
stained by vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) was unchanged
(Fig. 3F). Electron microscopy also supported a reduction of inhibito-
ry synapses in 15q dup S1BF (fig. S3). To confirm these abnormalities
Fig. 3. 15q dup mice have fewer inhibitory synapses and a higher excitability of pyramidal neurons in L2/3 of somatosensory cortex. (A to D) Representative
images show the S1BF with anti–microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and anti-VGAT immunostaining [A1 to D1 (left column), WT; A2 to D2 (right column), 15q dup]. At
low magnification, VGAT signals (white) are comparable between WT (A1) and 15q dup (A2) mice. Scale bars, 1 mm. At high magnification, inhibitory terminals (red, VGAT)
on neural dendrites (green, MAP2) in L2/3, L4, and L6 of the S1BF show that only in L2/3 were the VGAT signals weaker in 15q dup mice (B2) than in WT mice (B1). The VGAT
signals in L4 (C1 and C2) and L6 (D1 and D2) were comparable. Scale bars, 20 mm. (E) The density of VGAT-positive puncta is reduced in L2/3 of 15q dup mice (*P < 0.05, two-
tailed Student’s t test; n = 15 images from five mice per genotype). (F) The density of VGluT1-positve puncta was not changed in L2/3 of 15q dup mice. (G) Representative

t test), and the cumulative probability of the inter-event interval (IEI) was shifted to the right compared to WT mice. The amplitude and rise time were not changed, but the
decay time was increased in 15q dup mice (**P < 0.01, two-tailed Welch’s t test). (I) Representative traces of mEPSCs from L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the S1BF of WT and 15q

 at the functional level, we recorded miniature inhibitory postsynaptic
currents (IPSCs) and EPSCs (mIPSCs and mEPSCs, respectively)
from L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the S1BF (Fig. 3, G to J). The frequen-
cy of mIPSCs was significantly decreased in 15q dup mice, although
the amplitude and 10 to 90% rise time were unchanged (Fig. 3H). The
paired-pulse ratio of evoked IPSCs in 15q dup mice was the same as
that of WT (fig. S4), suggesting normal release probabilities of inhib-
itory synapses. We found that the decay of mIPSCs was slower in 15q
dup mice (Fig. 3H), which may be induced by the differential expres-
sion of GABA type A (GABAA) receptor subunits located in the du-
plicated chromosome because of the longer decay time constant of the
a5 subunit (fig. S5) (23). Consistent with histology, the electrophysio-
logical properties of mEPSCs were comparable between genotypes
(Fig. 3J). The 15q dup neurons showed higher input resistance (Fig.
3K), whereas the cellular capacitance and the resting membrane
potential were comparable with WT neurons (Fig. 3, L and M). The
15q dup neurons also had smaller hyperpolarization-activated cation
(Ih) currents (Fig. 3, N and O) and decreased dendritic length (fig.
S6), similar to those in autism-associated SHANK3 knockout mice
(24). Consistent with these findings, the intrinsic excitability of L2/3
pyramidal neurons was higher in 15q dup mice (Fig. 3, P and Q). Col-
lectively, these morphological and electrophysiological abnormalities
may contribute to the underlying mechanisms of reduced response
tuning specificity to whisker stimuli.
Serotonin modulation ameliorates local synaptic
transmission in 15q dup mice
How are the electrophysiological abnormalities related to the hypo-
serotonergic state of the 15q dup mouse? We examined whether 15q
dup mice have alterations in 5-HT responsiveness. Gene expression
of 5-HT receptors in 15q dup brain was unchanged (fig. S7). In 15q
dup mice, 5-HT application enhanced the frequency of spontaneous
IPSCs (sIPSCs) (fig. S8, A to F) and suppressed the intrinsic excit-
ability of S1BF pyramidal neurons (fig. S8, G and H), suggesting that
compensatory mechanisms took place in 15q dup cortex in response
to the hyposerotonergic state.
The cortical physiology results indicated the potential of 5-HT in-
tervention for restoring cortical E/I balance and behavior. To examine
this possibility, we administered the selective serotonin reuptake in-
hibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (FLX) to infant mice through their mothers
via milk to increase extracellular 5-HT levels (Fig. 4A) because the pre-
viously observed 5-HT reduction in 15q dup mice was seen from post-
natal 1 to 3 weeks (7). The serum levels of FLX and norfluoxetine (a
metabolite of FLX) in the treated offspring were 6.4 ± 6.4 and 220 ±
38 ng/ml at 2 weeks old and 43 ± 23 and 320 ± 70 ng/ml at 3 weeks old,
respectively, and neither FLX nor norfluoxetine was detected in serum
1 week after the last treatment. These results indicate that FLX was
substantially transferred to offspring mice. Notably, the mIPSC fre-
quency of L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the S1BF was ameliorated in
15q dup mice treated with FLX (FLX–15q dup) but not in the 15q
dup mice treated with vehicle (Veh–15q dup; Fig. 4, B and C). FLX
treatment did not change the amplitude and rise time of mIPSCs.
The decay time constant of FLX–15q dup was longer than that of
FLX-WT but not significantly different from that of Veh-WT (Fig.
4, B and C). These results indicate that the FLX treatment affects in-
hibitory synaptic connections rather than synaptic strength in 15q dup
S1BF. Next, we examined 5-HT neurons in the DRNs. The resting
membrane potential of FLX–15q dup was hyperpolarized compared
with that of FLX-WT (Fig. 4D). However, the sEPSC amplitudes at
both vmDRN and lwDRN of FLX–15q dup mice were comparable
to those of FLX-WT (Fig. 4, E and F). Together, these results indicate
that increasing the extracellular 5-HT rescued electrophysiological
phenotypes of 15q dup mice by modifying inhibitory transmission
in the S1BF and excitatory transmission in the DRN.
Early serotonergic intervention improves social behaviors in
15q dup mice
Finally, we investigated whether early 5-HT intervention in 15q dup
adult mice could be effective at the behavioral level. Wefirst confirmed
the restored levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
acid (5-HIAA), in FLX–15q dup mice (Fig. 5A). In the three-chamber
social interaction (3-CSI) test, FLX–15q dup mice spent more time
around the cage with a novel mouse than around the empty cage
(Fig. 5B), indicating that sociability of 15q dup mice was rescued by
FLX treatment. In the Morris water maze (MWM), all groups showed
a normal performance in the learning phase (Fig. 5, C and D), whereas
both FLX-WT and FLX–15q dup mice exhibited no difference in the
length of stay between the target and opposite quadrants in the rever-
sal learning phase, as did the Veh–15q dup mice (Fig. 5E). In the open-
field test, the FLX treatment induced lower exploratory activity in both
WT and 15q-dup mice (Fig. 5F, left). The time spent in the center of
the open field was decreased only in FLX–15q dup mice (Fig. 5F, mid-
dle). The “anxiety index,” which is calculated by normalization of the
distance traveled in the center of the open field by the total distance
traveled, was significantly decreased in FLX–15q dup mice (Fig. 5F,
right), indicating that they show an increase in anxiety. These results
suggest that FLX has not only positive but also negative effects on cer-
tain behaviors such as behavioral flexibility and exploratory behavior.
We also examined the effect of FLX treatment on communication be-
havior in pups by daily injection using two dosages (0.5 and 2.5 mg/
kg). Veh–15q dup mice exhibited a larger number of ultrasonic vocal-
izations (USVs) (Fig. 5G), which may reflect higher anxiety levels or
fear in response to stress, as previously reported (6). The FLX treat-
ment during the first 6 days after birth decreased the number of 15q
dup USVs at postnatal day 7 (P7) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5G),
suggesting that FLX treatment can ameliorate anxiety-like behaviors in
infant 15q dup mice.
Serotonergic neuromodulation of the cortical E/I balance in
15q dup mice
In summary, we identified an essential role for 5-HT in coordinating a
broad and plastic subset of ASD-related physiological and behavioral
phenotypes in 15q11-13 duplication mice (Fig. 5H). Our electro-
physiological results suggest that the cortical E/I balance of 15q dup
mice is shifted to an excitatory state due to decreased inhibitory con-
nections and intrinsic hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons, which is
affected bya weakened 5-HTsystem. Effects of the serotonergicsystem
on the cerebral cortex remain unclear because 5-HT receptors have
heterogeneity in their function and diversity of their expression (13).
Regarding the major receptors, it is suggested that the 5-HT1A receptor
can suppress the excitability of pyramidal neurons and that 5-HT2A
and 5-HT2C receptors can enhance interneuron activity in the rat pre-
frontal cortex (25), which may be associated with acute serotonergic
modulation in the S1BF of 15q dup mice (see fig. S8). Such serotoner-
gic neuromodulation was focused in the study of regulatory mecha-
nisms in sensory systems (26). The increased E/I ratio is associated
with an abnormal sensory system in ASD (27, 28), and disruption of in-
hibitory circuits is potentially associated with abnormalities in cortical

 processing (29). Our findings further strengthen these associations,
because 15q dup mice exhibited inaccurate sensory processing. How-
ever, the chronic effect of altered 5-HT levels is not well studied at the
in vivo circuit level. Thus, further investigation on whether the recov-
ered inhibitory connections ameliorate sensory response in the FLX-
treated mice should be undertaken in future studies.
Our findings also suggest that a subset of ASD-like behaviors, in-
cluding reduced social behavior and abnormal communication behav-
ior in infant stages but not elevated anxiety in adulthood and
behavioral inflexibility, is caused by reduced 5-HT levels. Recovery
of the 5-HT system in 15q dup mice may extend to cortical regions
associated with higher brain function [for example, medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC)]. It is reported that 5-HT exerts a potent control on
slow and gamma oscillations through 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors
in the rat secondary motor cortex and mPFC (30). Moreover, optogen-
etically elevated E/I balance of mPFC induces social dysfunction in WT
mice (31). There is a possibility that abnormal E/I balance in mPFC of
15q dup mice, which is induced by low 5-HT as in the case of S1BF, can
affect social behavior and that it can be recovered by FLX treatment.
This hypothesis will be interesting to examine in future studies.
Potential for developmental therapeutic intervention in the
5-HT system of ASD
Our results reveal the potential of developmental therapeutic interven-
tions in the 5-HT system to restore normal cortical E/I balance and
behavior in ASD, although it is difficult to simply apply the strategy
used in this study to humans. Clinical studies of SSRIs for ASD have
not reached unified conclusions (32), and to further develop therapeutic
methods for SSRIs, it will be essential to understand their downstream
output mechanisms, such as the oxytocin system, on regulating social
interaction phenotypes and other relevant behaviors.
Several candidate genes are located within the duplicated chromo-
some in 15q dup mice that may be linked to 5-HT abnormalities.

traces of mIPSCs from L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the S1BF of vehicle-treated WT (Veh-WT), vehicle-treated 15q dup (Veh–15q dup), FLX-treated WT (FLX-WT), and FLX-
treated 15q dup (FLX–15q dup) mice. (C) The graphs show box plots and cumulative probabilities for mIPSC frequency and basic synaptic responses from the treated
mice. The mIPSC frequency of Veh–15q dup was significantly lower, but the mIPSC frequency of FLX–15q dup was comparable with that of Veh-WT. The amplitude and
rise time of mIPSCs were not changed among these groups. The decay time of FLX–15q dup was not significantly different from that of Veh-WT but still longer than that
of FLX-WT mice. P values were obtained by Steel-Dwass test. (D) The hyperpolarized resting membrane potential of DRN 5-HT neurons in 15q dup mice was not
changed by the FLX treatment. P value was obtained by two-tailed Student’s t test. (E and F) The FLX treatment ameliorated reduction in sEPSC amplitude of 15q
dup mice. The sEPSC amplitudes in 5-HT neurons at vmDRN and lwDRN of FLX–15q dup were comparable with FLX-WT mice. There was no difference in sEPSC
frequency between groups at both vmDRN and lwDRN. n = cells per mice. Box plots represent the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles. Each dot represents

 Fig. 5. Restoration of 5-HT level improves social behaviors of 15q dup mice. (A) The tissue levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the midbrain at 9 weeks of age were examined.
Veh–15q dup showed a reduction in 5-HT levels (left) and 5-HIAA levels (right), whereas FLX–15q dup showed no difference in both levels compared with Veh-WT. P values were
obtained using the Games-Howell test. (B) Approaching time to the stranger cage (S) and the empty cage (C) in the 3-CSI test was compared in each group. Only in Veh–15q dup
was there no difference in approaching time to both cages, whereas others showed increased approaching time to the stranger cage. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01, exact Wilcoxon

 role for the pathogenesis of 15q dup mice because their cognate mu-
tant mice have abnormalities in the 5-HT system (33, 34). A selective
duplication, including these genes, was recently reported in two autis-
tic patients (35). Future studies will examine the functional roles of
genes within the duplicated CNV region in 5-HT–dependent neuron
and circuit development, synaptic activity and behavior, and their
therapeutic potential in reversing discrete ASD symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All procedures for animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the guidelines of the Animal Experimentation Committee of
Nippon Medical School, Hiroshima University, RIKEN Brain Science
Institute, and Kobe Institute. The generation of paternal 15q11-13
duplication mice (15q dup) was reported previously (6), and the line
was maintained by mating male 15q dup with WT female C57BL/6J
mice. All mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and
food and water were available ad libitum. For [18F]FDG-PET imaging,
3- to 5-month-old male mice were used. To fix brain volumes of the
habituated awake mice for the scanning, these aged mice were needed.
For transcranial imaging, 7- to 8-week-old mice were used. For
electrophysiology of 5-HT neurons, 5- to 8-week-old mice were used.
For in vivo electrophysiology, 4- to 8-week-old mice were used. For
immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology of the S1BF, 2- to
3-week-old mice were used. To ensure quality of in vitro and in vivo
electrophysiology using patch-clamp recordings, young aged mice
were needed. For monoamine measurement and adult behavior
tests, 9- to 12-week-old mice were used. Age-matched littermates were
used for all experiments.
Chronic drug treatment
FLX hydrochloride (0.1 mg/ml) (LKT Laboratories) in the drinking
water including 0.2% saccharin was used except for the USV test.
The FLX water was administered to mothers as previously described
(36). The offspring were treated with FLX through their mothers via
milk. Saccharin was used as control drinking water to promote
drinking; otherwise, mothers disfavored the FLX water. The saccharin
water was not used as drinking water under conventional breeding
conditions except for this experiment. FLX treatment was initiated
at P3 and terminated at P21. After weaning at P21, the offspring were
divided into groups of two to five per cage depending on the treat-
ment and were thereafter fed with normal water. For the USV test,
pups were treated with FLX [0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg dose diluted in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS)] by daily intraperitoneal injection from P1 to P6.
PET imaging for glucose metabolism
A head-holder attachment for fixation of the head during PET
scanning was placed on the skull of the mouse under 1.5% isoflurane
anesthesia using a stereotaxic instrument (SR-6N, Narishige) at
least 7 days before the PET experiments as previously described
(37). Each mouse, which had been well-trained and acclimated to the
head-fixation apparatus several times, was fasted for 12 hours and
catheterized with a 30-gauge stainless steel needle with a polyethylene
tube into the tailvein for injection of [18F]FDG before the PETscan. The
mouse was set on the apparatus with head fixation in a small-animal
PETscanner(microPETFocus220,SiemensMedicalSystems). A trans-
mission scan for attenuation correction was performed for 30 min using
a 68Ge-68Ga point source before the emission scan, and [18F]FDG at a
dose of 12 to 15 MBq in 0.1 ml of physiological saline was intravenously
injected via the catheter for 10 s using a syringe pump. A dynamic emis-
sion PET scan was then performed for 60 min in triplicate for each
mouse on separate days. The PET images were reconstructed using a
filtered back-projection algorithm with attenuation and no scatter cor-
rection for quantitative evaluation of [18F]FDG uptake. Data analysis
was performed on seven mice in each group. Two of nine mice in each
group were excluded from the data analysis because their blood glucose
levels showed higher concentrations (no less than 100 mg/dl) before the
beginning of the PET scan. For quantitative analysis of the rCGM, we
evaluated the standardized uptake value of glucose as an index and com-
pared the values between 15q dup and WT mice using PMOD image
analysis software (version 3.4; PMOD Technologies Ltd.). Each PET
image was co-registered to an FDG-mean image template created using
all PET images in the experiment. For identification of the rCGM, a typ-
ical mouse brain magnetic resonance T1-weighted image obtained with
a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging system (Signa Horizon Lx VH3, GE
Healthcare) from an age- and sex-matched mouse of the same strain
was used. To identify the precise locations of brain regions showing sta-
tistical significance, averaged PET images made by left-right flipping
were used. A broader analysis of the rCGM was performed by a two-
group comparison test using SPM8 software (Wellcome Trust Centre
for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, UK).
Immunohistochemistry
Three-week-old male mice were anesthetized and transcardially per-
fused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were removed and immersion-fixed
with 4% PFA at 4°C overnight, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS
for 2 days at 4°C, embedded in an OCT (optimum cutting tempera-
ture) compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetechnical), and frozen in
powdered dry ice. Coronal or sagittal sections (30 mm thick) were
made using a cryostat and collected in PBS containing 0.01% NaN3
and stored at 4°C until use. Sections were treated with 0.3% H2O2 in
PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS for 5 min three times, incubated with
a blocking solution (PBS containing 3% normal goat or donkey serum
and 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated
with primary antibodies diluted with the blocking solution overnight at
4°C. Sections were washed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100
(PBST) for 10 min four times, incubated with fluorescent-conjugated
secondary antibodies diluted with the blocking solution for 1 hour at
roomtemperature, washedwithPBST for10min fourtimes,transferred
onto SuperFrost slides, and mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector
Laboratories). The sections were imaged with an FV1000 (Olympus)
confocal microscope for puncta analysis and with a BZ8100 fluores-
cent microscope (Keyence) for cell counting. The images were ana-
lyzed using ImageJ software.

tion; catalog no. 711-165-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used
for secondary antibodies.
Puncta analysis
L2/3 of S1BF (bregma, −1.34 to −1.82 mm; lateral direction, 2.5 to
3.5 mm) of male mice at P21 was imaged with an FV1000 (Olympus)
confocal laser scanning microscope at 60× magnification digitally
zoomed 1.6 times. For VGluT1 puncta analysis, a total of 150 images
at 512 × 512 pixels were acquired from five mice per genotype. For
VGAT puncta analysis, a total of 15 images were acquired from five
mice per genotype. Using the area selection tool of ImageJ software,
108 × 108 pixel areas (688.75 mm2) devoid of somata were selected
and converted into binary data with a certain threshold. The thresh-
old was determined to outline as many immunopositive puncta as
possible throughout all images with subsequent linearity check,
where the linear increase of the number of puncta as a function of
the number of image stacks was tested (focal planes taken at a dis-
tance of 1 mm). The experiment and analysis were performed without
knowledge of the genotype.
Transcranial calcium imaging
Seven- to eight-week-old G7NG817 heterozygote male and female
mice (38), which were bred from male 15q dup mice and female
G7NG817 heterozygote mice, were used for calcium imaging. Mice
were anesthetized with urethane [1.5 g/kg, intraperitoneally (ip); 15%
solution in PBS buffer], fixed to a stereotaxic stage by the ear bar, and
placed under a fluorescence stereomicroscope (MZ10F, Leica). The
GFP3 filter set (excitation, 470 ± 20 nm; emission, 525 ± 25 nm; Leica)
was used with the EL6000 light source (Leica). Images were acquired
using the ORCA-Flash 2.0 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics)
using HC Image software (Hamamatsu Photonics). The HC Image
software also controlled a shutter unit to illuminate the skull only dur-
ing imaging. Images were acquired with a size of 512 × 512 pixels and
16-bit resolution at a 30-Hz frame rate. The left C2 whisker was cut at
10 mm above the skin, and the surrounding whiskers were trimmed.
By the custom device made out of a piezo driver, the C2 whisker was
backwardly deflected 20 times with a 200-ms duration at a frequency of
1 Hz and 10 times with a 25-ms duration at 10 Hz and repeated 16 times
at an interval of 30 s.
The original 512 × 512 pixel images were reduced to 64 × 64 pixels
by binning. The ratio of the relative fluorescent change and the
baseline fluorescence (DF/F) was calculated by taking the baseline
(F) as the signal 500 ms before the stimulus presentation. For the
analysis of sensory-evoked response area, the principal area is
defined as the region that exceeds the mean response in the 3 × 3
binned area around the peak value during 500 ms from the stimulus
onset; the surrounding area is defined as the region that exceeds 60%
of the mean peak amplitude during 500 ms from the stimulus onset.
In this analysis, the principal area size in WT mice was about 0.04 to
0.05 mm2, which is consistent with the histological C2 barrel size. To
compute the decay slope, the mean whisker-evoked responses for re-
spective periods were normalized to their peak value. Pseudocoloring
was carried out using Origin 9.0 (OriginLab).
In vivo electrophysiology
Male and female littermates (4 to 8 weeks old) were used. Mice were
anesthetized with urethane [1.5 g/kg, ip; 15 to 20% solution was
prepared in Hepes-buffered saline containing 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.3)]. The
depth of anesthesia was monitored by vibrissa movements and with-
drawal reflex to hindlimb pinch. Body temperature was maintained at
37° ± 1°C using a heating pad. The animal’s head was fixed on a stereo-
taxic apparatus using ear bars (Narishige). After cutting the skin and
removing muscles and connective tissues, the skull over the cerebral
cortex was exposed. Lidocaine gel was applied to the skin incision. A
craniotomy (diameter, 1 to 2 mm) was performed by using a microdrill
(NSK) to expose a barrel cortex at 3.5 to 4 mm lateral and 1 to 1.5 mm
posterior from the bregma. Subsequently, the dura was cut using a
30-gauge syringe needle and fine forceps. The craniotomy was then
filled with 1.5% low–melting point agarose dissolved in Hepes-buffered
saline as described above. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were
made with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) by in vivo
blind patch-clamp techniques as previously described (39, 40). Briefly, a
high positive pressure (100 to 200 mbar) was applied to the pipette to
prevent tip occlusion while penetrating the agarose and the pia. After
passing the pia, the positive pressure was immediately reduced (25 to
35 mbar) to prevent cortical damage. The pipette advanced in 2-mm
steps, and monitoring pipette resistance was used for searching target
cells under voltage-clamp mode with a square voltage step (10 mV,
20-ms duration at 50 Hz). When current pulse amplitude decreased
suddenly (20 to 50%), quick removal of the positive pressure (following
gentle suction, if required to obtain tight seals) resulted in a gigohm seal
(>1gigohm). Aftercell-attached configuration, whole-cellconfiguration
was obtained by the breaking of the patch membrane using a slow
ramp of negative pressure. The resistance of the patch pipette was 5 to
10 megohms when filled with one of the internal solutions with the
following compositions: 135 mM K-D-gluconate, 4 mM KCl, 10 mM
Hepes, 10 mM Na2-phosphocreatine, 4 mM Mg–adenosine tri-
phosphate (ATP), and 0.3 mM Na3–guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
(pH 7.3). Liquid junction potential (7 mV) was not corrected. Series
resistance was typically 20 to 100 megohms. Electrophysiological data
were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 20 or 50 kHz with an ITC-18 in-
terface (Instrutech) and acquired with AxoGraph X software (AxoGraph
Scientific). Data were analyzed with AxoGraph X, Microsoft Excel
(Microsoft), and OriginPro (OriginLab). Single whisker deflection
was performed by a voltage step with a 10 to 90% rise of 4.5 ms to a
piezoelectric stimulator with an attached glass capillary (41). The deflec-
tion point of the whisker was about 5 mm from its base. The whisker
was deflected backward by 0.8 mm for 200 ms at a frequency of 0.5 Hz
and repeated typically 10 to 20 times consecutively. The peak amplitude
of whisker-evoked PSP was calculated from averaged traces within
100 ms from stimulation onset. The principal whisker was identified
as the whisker-evoking, shortest-latency PSP. The analysis was per-
formed blind to genotype.
In vitro electrophysiology on 5-HT neurons
Brain slices for experiments were prepared from 5- to 8-week-old male
mice as previously described (42). The mice were deeply anesthetized

 by halothane inhalation (~2% in air, v/v) for decapitation. The brains
were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold Na+-deficient saline
(~4°C) containing the following compounds: 252 mM sucrose,
21 mM NaHCO3, 3.35 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM
NaH2PO4, and 10 mM glucose. Each brain was cut into blocks, and
three to four coronal slices (250 mm) were cut with a vibratome
(VT1200s, Leica) through the entire rostrocaudal extent of the DRN
between −4.84 and −4.48 mm from the bregma. The slices were placed
in a submerged chamber for at least 1 hour in artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (ACSF) containing 138.6 mM NaCl, 3.35 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2,
1.3 mM MgCl2, 21 mM NaHCO3, 0.6 mM NaH2PO4·2H2O, and
10 mM glucose. The ACSF was maintained at pH 7.4 by bubbling with
95% O2/5% CO2 gas.
Individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber attached
to a microscope stage and continuously perfused with oxygenated
ACSF at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min and a temperature of 28°C. Boro-
silicate glass-patch electrodes (World Precision Instruments) were
used for whole-cell recordings from DRN cells and had a resistance
of 4 to 6 megohms when filled with an internal solution of 150 mM
K-methanesulfonate, 1 mM KCl, 0.2 mM K-EGTA, 20 mM Hepes,
3 mM Mg-ATP2, 0.4 mM Na-GTP, and 15 mM biocytin (pH 7.38).
DRN serotonergic cells were visually identified on infrared–differential
interference contrast images using a water-immersion objective (40×,
numerical aperture of 0.80; Olympus). The recorded neurons were in-
fused with biocytin via the recording patch electrode. After the
experiments, immunohistochemical procedures were used to visualize
the cell morphology and identify Tph immunoreactivity, which is a
marker of 5-HT neurons. Briefly, the slices were immersion-fixed
overnight in 4% PFA prepared in 0.1 M PBS and then stored in
PBS until use. The fixed sections were incubated with anti-Tph poly-
clonal antibody for 3 days at 4°C. Subsequently, the sections were
incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody
and Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated streptavidin (1:1000 dilution; Life
Technologies) to visualize Tph immunohistochemical labeling and
biocytin, respectively.
In vitro electrophysiology for L2/3 pyramidal neurons in
somatosensory cortex
Male and female P15 to P23 littermate mice were used. Mice were
anesthetized with CO2 gas for decapitation. Cortical slices (300 mm)
were prepared as previously described (43). The brains were sectioned
with VT1000 or VT1200S slicers (Leica Microsystems) in an ice-cold
cutting solution containing 120 mM choline-Cl, 2 mM KCl, 8 mM
MgCl2, 28 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, and 20 mM glucose
bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. For recovery, slices were incubated
for 1 hour in a normal external solution containing 125 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4,
26 mM NaHCO3, and 20 mM glucose, which was bubbled continu-
ously with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at room temperature.
Whole-cell recordings were made from the somata of L2/3 pyram-
idal neurons in the S1BF using an upright microscope (BX50WI,
Olympus). Pyramidal neurons were identified on the basis of the tri-
angular appearance of the cell soma and the presence of a single apical
dendrite as well as electrophysiological properties. All experiments
were carried out at 32° ± 1°C. The composition of intracellular solu-
tions were as follows: 35 mM K-D-gluconate, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM
NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.34 mM Na2-GTP, and
4 mM Mg-ATP (pH 7.3 with KOH) for IPSC recording and 140 mM
K-D-gluconate, 8 mM KCl, 2 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes,
3 mM Mg-ATP, and 0.5 mM Na2-GTP (pH 7.3 with KOH) for EPSC
recording. The membrane potential was held at −80 mV for both EPSC
and IPSC recordings. By using the intracellular solution containing high
chloride ion, IPSCs were detected as inward currents at a holding
potential of −80 mV. Miniature PSCs were recorded in the presence
of 0.5 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX) 10 min after the establishment of
whole-cellpatchclamp.The normalexternalsolutionwassupplemented
with 5 mM (R)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid

sulfonamideforIPSCrecordingtoblockNMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate)
and AMPA receptors or 50 mM picrotoxin for EPSC recording to block
GABAA receptors. sIPSCs were recorded in the absence of TTX. Ionic
currents were recorded with an Axopatch 1D patch-clamp amplifier
(Molecular Devices) or EPC10 USB (HEKA). Signals were digitized at
20 kHz for recording-evokedresponsesor at 40 kHz for recordingmin-
iature responses. Online data acquisition and offline data analysis were
performed using the PULSE or PATCHMASTER software (HEKA).
For electrical stimulation, a stimulating electrode filled with standard
saline was placed in L2/3 around recording cells. Electrical stimuli (du-
ration, 0.1 ms; amplitude, 0.8 to 5.5 mA) were applied at 10- to 3000-ms
intervals. For acute 5-HT treatment, 10 mM serotonin creatinine sul-
fate was added in the external bath solution. The sIPSC and mIPSC re-
cordings before 5-HT treatment and 2 to 4 min after treatment were
analyzed as pretreatment and 5-HT conditions, respectively. The mIPSCs

TTX, 10 mM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt hy-
drate, and 50 mM D-(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. Miniature
responses were analyzed using Mini Analysis Program (version 6.0.7;
Synaptosoft Inc.).
For Ih current analysis, 2 mM 4-aminopyridine, 0.5 mM BaCl2,
and 1 mM TTX were added in the external bath solution. The neu-
rons were held at −40 mV and hyperpolarized with 2-s voltage steps
from −50 to −120 mV in 10-mV increments. Whole-cell capacitive
transients and leak currents were not compensated for in this record-
ing. The Ih currents were calculated by dividing the instantaneous
current measured at the beginning of the step by the steady-state cur-
rent measured at the end of the step. All analyses were performed
blind to genotype.
Quantitative analyses of 5-HT and 5-HIAA
The concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the midbrain were
measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
system (Eicom) as previously described (36). The midbrain samples
were dissected from 9- to 10-week-old mice and stored at −80°C until
use. For analyses, the samples were homogenized in 0.2 M ice-cold
perchloric acid, and the homogenates were cooled on ice for 30 min
for deproteinization. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000g for
15 min at 0°C. The pH of the supernatants was adjusted to approxi-
mately 3 by adding 1 M sodium acetate, and the pellets were used for
protein quantification. The supernatants were filtered through a
0.45-mm filter (Millipore), and 10 ml of the filtrate was applied to the
HPLC system. The system had a 3 × 150 mm octadecylsilane column
(SC-5ODS, Eicom) and an electrochemical detector (HTEC-500, Eicom)
set to an applied potential of 750 mV versus an Ag/AgCl reference ana-
lytical electrode. The changes in electric current (in nanoamperes) were re-
corded using a computer interface. The mobile phase was composed
of 0.1 M aceto–citric acid buffer (pH 3.5), methanol, 0.46 M sodium-

 was performed using a Bio-Rad protein assay system (Bio-Rad)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Behavioral tests
All behavioral tests were performed between 8:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.
The procedures were principally based on those described in our pre-
vious report (6). The observer was blinded to the mouse genotypes
until all behavioral tests were finished. All apparatuses and analysis
software were products of O’Hara & Co. Ltd.
Open-field test
The open-field test was performed before the 3-CSI test. The plastic
open-field chamber was 50 cm (length) × 50 cm (width) × 50 cm
(height). The field was illuminated at 40 lux. Behavior was monitored
for 15 min and recorded with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera
connected to a personal computer. The total ambulation distance
and percentage of time spent in the center of the field were recorded
automatically using Image OF software. The center of the field was
defined as a central square of 30 cm × 30 cm. The distance traveled
in the center area was measured using ImageJ software at offline
analysis.
3-CSI test
The apparatus usedwas a plastic box [40 cm (length) × 60 cm (width) ×
20 cm (height)] with two partitions that separated the box into three
chambers of the same size. The box was illuminated at 100 lux, and the
partitions had openings that allowed the mouse to move freely from
one chamber to another. Wire cages [11 cm (height) × 9 cm (diame-
ter)] were placed at the left corner of the left chamber and at the right
corner of the right chamber. Before the test, each subject mouse was
allowed to acclimate to the test box by free exploration for 5 min. Sub-
sequently, an unfamiliar younger WT C57BL/6J male mouse (stranger
mouse) that had no previous contact with the subjectmouse was placed
in the wire cage at one corner, whereas the cage at the opposite corner
remained empty. The locations of the stranger mouse and the empty
cage were alternated between the left and right chambers on consecu-
tive sessions. At the beginning of the test, the subject mouse was placed
in the middle chamber and allowed to move freely throughout all three
chambers. During a 10-min session, the behaviorwas recorded, andthe
time spent in the interaction zone (approaching time), which is defined
as an area within 9 cm from the edge of the wire cage, was measured
automatically using Image CSI software.
MWM test
The visible platform, hidden platform, probe test, and reversal probe
test components of the MWM test were conducted. A circular pool
[100 cm (diameter) × 20 cm (height)] filled with water (23° ± 0.5°C)
was used for the tests. Each training trial began by placing the mouse
into the quadrant that was adjacent right, adjacent left, or opposite to
the target quadrant containing the platform (10 cm in diameter and
1 cm beneath the water surface), in a semi-random order. A different
order of the start positions was applied every day, but the identical
order of start positions was used for all mice. The training trials were
60 s in maximum duration. A mouse that failed to reach the platform
within 60 s was subsequently guided to the platform. Four trials per
day (25-min intervals between trials) were conducted for six successive
days for acquisition of the hidden platform test with the original plat-
form location and four successive days with a new platform location
(reversal probe test) rotated 180° from the original platform location.
At 1 hour after the end of the 6th day and 10th day of hidden platform
training, a probe test and a reversal probe test were conducted for
1 min to confirm that these spatial learning tests were acquired on
the basis of navigation by distal environmental room cues, respective-
ly. The time spent in each quadrant and numbers of crossings above
the former target site were automatically recorded with a CCD camera
connected to a personal computer and analyzed by TimeWMZ
software. We excluded data from mice that stopped searching for
the platform and floated in the water for more than 5 s in the probe
tests.
USV test
Both male and female pups (P7) were used. To examine the effect of
FLX dosage, we treated the pups daily (from P1 to P6) with FLX (0.5
or 2.5 mg/kg dose diluted in PBS) by intraperitoneal injection. On
the day of the study, the pups with their mother were moved to
the experimental room at least 60 min before the initiation of the
study. After habituation, each pup was removed from its mother
and placed in a stainless steel cylinder [7.5 cm (diameter) × 7 cm
(height)] on the COOL PLATE (NCP-2215, Nisshin Rika Co.
Ltd.), which maintained a cylinder temperature of 25°C in a
soundproof room (AT-81, RION Co. Ltd.). The number of vocaliza-
tion was measured for 5 min. Individual calls made by each pup were
collected by an ultrasound-detectable microphone (UC-29, RION
Co. Ltd.) and then amplified by a preamplifier (NH-05A, RION
Co. Ltd.) and a main amplifier (UN-04A, RION Co. Ltd.) with a
high-pass filter (1.5 kHz; Multifunction filter 3611, NF Co. Ltd.).
Then, analog signals were converted to digital signals by an analog-
to-digital converter (CH-3150, Exacq Technologies Inc.) and stored
in a personal computer. The numbers of vocalizations were counted
by the recording software (Dasy Lab 9.0, measX GmbH and Co. KG)
with a digital filter at 20 kHz to count the vocalizations generated at
the ultrasound range. In the case of power spectrum analysis, stored
signals were transformed with the fast Fourier transform method
by the MATLAB software and visualized by SASLab Pro (Avisoft
Bioacoustics).
Statistics
Data sets were first tested for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk normal-
ity test, and then equal variances were tested using an F test in the case
of two-group comparison or a Bartlett test in the case of multiple com-
parison. If the data sets fit a normal distribution, a parametric method
was used, and if not, a nonparametric method was used. A two-tailed
Student’s t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test for the data sets with equal
variances and a two-tailed Welch’s t test and Brunner-Munzel test for
the data sets with non-equal variances were used in parametric and
nonparametric analyses, respectively. For multiple comparison tests,
a Steel test or a Steel-Dwass test was used for the data sets with non-
normality and equal variances, and a Games-Howell test was used
when the criteria of normality and equal variance were not satisfied.
A two-tailed paired t test and exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test were
used for comparison of paired samples. A two-sample Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test was used for morphological analysis of 5-HT neurons.
For the analysis of gene expression, P value was corrected with the
Holm method. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used for
comparison of dendritic blanch interactions and Ih currents of pyram-
idal neurons. In PET imaging, a statistically significant difference in
the rCGM between WT and 15q dup mice was defined at a threshold
of P < 0.005 (uncorrected). The analyses described above were per-
formed with GraphPad software, StatView software, or R version
3.3.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Differences were
considered to be statistically nonsignificant when P > 0.05. All statis-
tical results are described in table S3.
