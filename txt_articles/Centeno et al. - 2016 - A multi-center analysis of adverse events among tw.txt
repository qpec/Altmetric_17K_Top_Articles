Abstract
Introduction The purpose of the present investigation is to
report on detailed complications among a much larger group
of 2372 orthopaedic patients treated with stem cell injections
who were followed in a treatment registry for up to nine years.
Methods All patients underwent an MSC-based, percutane-
ous injection treatment of an orthopaedic condition between
December 2005 and September 2014 at one of 18 clinical
facilities. Treated areas of the body included the knee, hip,
ankle/foot, hand/wrist, elbow, shoulder, and spine. The pa-
tients were followed prospectively via enrollment in a treat-
ment registry. Patients were followed prospectively at one,
three, six and 12 months, and annually thereafter, using an
electronic system, ClinCapture software.
Results A total of 3012 procedures were performed on 2372
patients with follow-up period of 2.2 years. A total of 325
adverse events were reported. The majority were pain post-
procedure (n=93, 3.9 % of the study population) and pain due
to progressive degenerative joint disease (n=90, 3.8 % of the
study population). Seven cases reported neoplasms, a lower
rate than in the general population. The lowest rate of adverse
events was observed among patients injected with BMC
alone.
Conclusion Lowest rate of adverse events was among those
patients receiving BMC injections alone, but the higher rate of
AEs for BMC plus adipose and cultured cells was readily
explained by the nature of the therapy or the longer follow-
up. There was no clinical evidence to suggest that treatment

Introduction
Autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been uti-
lized to treat degenerative and post-traumatic orthopedic con-
ditions for more than two decades [1]. Because MSCs can
differentiate into bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, and ligament
tissue and can use paracrine and other effects to elicit signif-
icant changes in injured tissues, their use for treating ortho-
paedic conditions holds significant promise [2–5]. In a clinical
setting MSCs are typically harvested from bone marrow, then
isolated and either re-injected or implanted in the same surgi-
cal procedure or culture expanded and then used clinically.
The same surgical procedure use of bone marrow aspirate
is known as bone marrow concentrate (BMC). This is a frac-
tion of the whole marrow which is isolated via centrifugation
and subsequently injected into joints and surrounding tissue
[3]. BMC contains MSCs and other nucleated cells, including
hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, macro-
phages, and platelets [6]. MSCs can also be isolated from
marrow aspirate and then expanded in culture as a means of
increasing the MSC dose [7]. In contrast with therapy utilizing
BMC in which the entire procedure is performed in the same
procedure, in vitro culture-expansion of MSCs requires a one
to two week period of preparation and incubation.
A number of studies published over an 18-year span have
described the safe use of autologous bone marrow derived
MSCs to treat orthopaedic conditions [1, 5, 8–12]. The results
of these studies, bolstered by the results of in vitro and animal
studies, indicate that bone marrow derived MSCs carry little to
no risk of malignant transformation, and that they are likely
safe for use in human orthopaedic applications [4, 7, 13–15].
However, no large scale investigations exist with long-term
patient follow-up where all complications have been reported,
adjudicated, and classified.
We have previously published the results of two treatment
registry studies that followed reported complications among
227 (in 2010) and 339 (in 2011) orthopaedic patients treated
with culture-expanded MSCs [9, 14]. The purpose of the pres-
ent investigation is to report on detailed complications among
a much larger group of 2372 orthopaedic patients treated with
stem cell injections who were followed in a treatment registry
for up to nine years. The patients in the present analysis fall
into one of the following treatment groups: 1) those who were
treated with BMC only; 2) those who were treated with
BMC along with an adipose graft, and 3) those who were
treated with culture-expanded MSCs.
Methods
Participants and settings
Subjects included in the present study are all patients who
underwent an MSC-based, percutaneous injection treatment
of an orthopaedic condition between December 2005 and
September 2014 at one of 18 clinical facilities located in the
United States or Australia and who had attained at least a
three month follow-up period. Treated conditions included
those resulting from degenerative joint changes (i.e., osteoar-
thritis, degenerative disc disease, degenerative disc disease) as
well as trauma (e.g., anterior cruciate ligament injuries, rotator
cuff tears, etc.). Treated areas of the body included the knee,
hip, ankle/foot, hand/wrist, elbow, shoulder, and spine. Knee,
hip, and shoulder patients constituted approximately 87 % of
the population.
The patients were followed prospectively via enrollment in
a treatment registry. Patients were grouped by type of MSC
treatment (see below). The choice of treatment type was left to
the treating physician and while there were no exclusion
criteria for MSC-treated patients to enter the registry, patients
were naturally excluded from treatment if they were found not
to be a candidate for the treatment by the attending physician.
Reasons for exclusion from treatment included conditions for
which the only therapeutic alternative was deemed to be sur-
gery as well as medical conditions that would make MSC
therapy difficult. Examples include a completely torn and
retracted tendon or ligament, a severely osteoarthritic knee
with deformity, severe spinal stenosis with neurologic com-
promise, and severe rheumatologic conditions like rheumatoid
arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Institutional Review
Board oversight for the registry protocol was provided by a
U.S. Office of Human Research Protections registered organi-
zation (#IRB00002637). Outcomes and efficacy of each pro-
cedure have been reported previously [2, 8, 13, 16]. Prior to
each procedure, physicians discussed risks, benefits, and al-
ternatives to the procedure. Each subject gave both oral and
written informed consent for procedure.
Baseline information collected in the registry included pri-
mary diagnosis, patient demographics, medical history, and
physical examination. Patients were followed prospectively
at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post treatment, and annually there-
after, using an electronic system, ClinCapture software
(Clinovo Clinical Data Solutions, Sunnyvale, California).
Patients were sent automated e-mails that asked them to re-
spond to a number of questions regarding outcomes, function,
and general health. Three e-mails were sent once a week and if
the patient failed to respond after three e-mails, the registry
1756
International Orthopaedics (SICOT) (2016) 40:1755–1765
 staff initiated two phone calls. If the patient failed to respond
to these additional two queries, then the time point was con-
sidered lost to follow-up and the process began again at the
next time point. Attending physicians participating in the reg-
istry were also encouraged to report any complications.
In addition to outcome information, patients were also
asked the following two questions regarding possible
treatment-related adverse events (AEs): BDid you experience
any complications you believe may be due to the procedure
(i.e., infection, illness, etc.)? If yes, please explain;^ and
BHave you been diagnosed with any new illness since the
procedure? If yes, please explain.^ The complications ques-
tions were intentionally broad in order to capture any change
in the patient’s health status that could possibly be related to
the MSC procedure.
Treatment groups
The patients were grouped based on type of MSC treatment,
as follows: SD (same day aspiration, isolation, and re-
injection procedure with BMC), AD (same day aspiration,
isolation, and re-injection procedure with BMC plus adipose
graft), and CE (culture expanded MSCs re-implanted weeks
or months after bone marrow aspiration) (see Supplement 1).
All physicians were trained to use the same protocol for bone
marrow aspiration, adipose graft, and re-injection procedures.
Two weeks prior to the bone marrow harvest procedure,
patients in all groups were restricted from using steroidal and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in order to avoid pos-
sible cytotoxic effects on MSCs [17]. All injections in this
study were confirmed with ultrasound or fluoroscopic imag-
ing to ensure accurate placement. Two to five days prior to the
administration of the MSCs to the treatment area, the patient’s
joint, ligament, or tendon was pre-injected with 12.5 % hyper-
tonic dextrose to promote an inflammatory response and begin
the process of tissue repair. The decision to use this protocol
was based on promising earlier observations in animal models
that this protocol aided tendon healing and improved function
in knee osteoarthritis patients and confirmed more recently
through stabilization of cartilage volume on MRI in patients
receiving only this treatment [18]. A detailed description of
the procedures performed for the SD, AD, and CE groups are
provided in our earlier publications [7, 9, 16]. Briefly, bone
marrow harvest was completed via the collection of approxi-
mately 10–15 cc of bone marrow aspirate from the six to ten
total sites from the bilateral posterior iliac crests. For the BMC
injections (SD and AD groups), the aspirate was centrifuged
to separate the buffy coat, resulting in 1–3 ml of BMC gener-
ally containing 0.2-1.5×108 nucleated cells. Platelet rich plas-
ma (PRP) and platelet lysate (PL) was concurrently prepared
and injected along with the BMC into the target region on the
same day as the bone marrow aspiration. In the AD group, an
additional component of minimally processed lipo-aspirate
which had been separated from the aqueous and oil compo-
nents was co-injected along with the BMC (3–7 cc) and PRP
and PL solution [7]. All isolation techniques for PRP, PL, SD,
AD, and CE were standardized using a standard operating
procedure (SOP) protocol that has been described in previous
publications [7, 9, 16]. Specifically, purpose built kits were
not used, but all sites used the same off the shelf disposable lab
supplies and the same or similar equipment such as centri-
fuges, pipettes, and microscopy. Staff at each site were trained
in these SOP protocols. Based off the PLRA classification, the
type of PRP produced is 1 cc of 14x/−/−/NO [19] but baseline
platelet counts were not obtained. In the CE group, MSCs
isolated from the bone marrow aspirate were expanded in an
autologous based culture media for 12–16 days prior to injec-
tion into the joint space (1–3 cc in PL with dose ranges gen-
erally from 0.1-6×107 MSCs) or musculoskeletal structure
(see Supplement 1 which elaborates on treatment differences
between groups) [14]. Injectate volumes and dose were re-
corded, but not controlled and were determined by the treating
physician.
Adverse events adjudication
AEs accessed from the treatment registry were initially sorted
into one of 20 categories: allergic, bone, cardiac, endocrine,
gastrointestinal, immune, infection, lab work, neoplasm, neu-
rologic, pain-post procedure, pain due to progressive DJD,
pain-other areas, pain-other, pulmonary, renal, rheumatologi-
cal, skin, vascular, and other.
AEs were further categorized by the attending physician as:
(1) serious adverse events (SAEs) or non-SAEs (2) expected
or unexpected, and, as appropriate (3) related to the implanta-
tion procedure or related to stem cells (not mutually exclu-
sive). AEs related to the implantation procedure or the stem
cells were further defined as Bdefinite,^ Bpossible,^ Bunlikely,^
or Bnot related.^ SAEs were defined using guidelines devel-
oped by the United States Department of Health and Human
Services [20]. This is defined as any untoward event that re-
sults in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitaliza-
tion or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results
in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or requires
intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. All
Bpossible^ SAEs were tabulated by one author (CJC) and then
provided to five independent physician reviewers who were
blinded to any initial or subsequent adjudication by another
reviewer. The tabulating author (CJC) also remained blinded
as to the identity of the physician who performed any specific
independent adjudication. The independent reviewers were un-
related to the treating physicians in the study. Independent
reviewers were recruited via an electronic discussion board
for physicians if they: (1) had experience in using platelet
rich plasma or stem cells for orthopaedic conditions
(2) were a practicing physician in private or academic

 practice (Mishra, Feb 2009). In order to estimate the AE inci-
dence, a person-time metric was calculated based on the num-
ber of patients and the amount of time they were followed from
the time of treatment. The follow-up period was calculated
from the date of the procedure to the date of data access or
study exit.
Statistical analysis
The treatment groups were described by age, body-mass
index (BMI), follow-up time, gender, and the joint/area
treated. Frequency, proportion, and the rate of AEs by
category were reported for each treatment group. AE rates
were compared between treatment groups using a chi-
square test. Frequency, proportion, and rate were also
reported for SAEs, expected AEs, procedure-related AEs,
and stem cell-related AEs. Categorical differences in pro-
portions and rates between groups were analyzed using a
chi-square test. Post hoc pair-wise comparisons between
groups were made using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test,
as appropriate. AE incidence rates were calculated by di-
viding the frequency of a specific AE by the total person-
year (PY) denominator, with the results reported per 100
PY. Logistic regression analysis for binary outcomes was
used to quantify the risk of reporting an AE, SAE, and
treatment-related AE by treatment group, and adjusted for
potential predictive or confounding factors (i.e., length of
follow-up, age, gender, and body area treated). All statis-
tical analyses were performed using SAS software version
9.4 [21].

 Results
There were 2372 patients in the registry who were treated with
any one of the three autologous MSC protocols in the period
between December 2005 and September 2014. The follow-up
period ranged from 1 month to 8.8 years, with 2.2 years mean
follow-up time. In the SD group 1590 patients were treated
(1949 BMC injections), 247 patients were treated in the AD
group (364 BMC injections with adipose graft), and 535 pa-
tients were treated in the CE group (699 culture-expanded
MSCs procedures). The higher number of procedures than
patients indicates both serial procedures that occurred at dif-
ferent times and/or bilateral or multiple joint procedures that
occurred in the same treatment session. The CE group was
followed for an average of 4.4 years (3 months to 9 years),
and the SD and AD groups were followed for an average of
1.1 (3 months-5 years) and 1.8 years (3 months to 4 years),
respectively (see Fig. 1). Other baseline characteristics are
reported in Table 1.
There were a total of 325 AEs reported by 287 patients
(12.1 % of the study population), with 36 reported SAEs,
representing 1.5 % of the study population and incidence of
0.7/100 PY (see Fig. 2 and Table 2). SAE incidences were
significantly different between groups, with the CE group
reporting the highest incidence at 1.1/100 PY, versus 0.9/100
PY in the AD group and 0.4/100 PY in the SD group
(P=0.006). There were 38 AEs that were deemed to be defi-
nitely related to the procedures (1.6 % of the total population)
and ten AEs definitely related to stem cells (0.4 % of the total
population). Incidences of procedure- and stem cell-related
AEs were not significantly different between treatment
groups.
The majority of AEs were post-procedure pain or
attributed to degenerative joint disease (DJD) for which
the treatment was sought (Fig. 3). There were 93 reports
of post-procedure pain (3.9 % of the study population),
and 90 reports of pain due to DJD (3.8 % of the study
population) (Table 2). There were 27 AEs classified as
Bother^ (i.e., that did not fit into any of the described
categories) and Bpain in other areas^ was reported by 16
patients. This last category describes AEs where the
patient reported pain in an area that was not treated

 (i.e., the knee was treated and the patient reported new
onset shoulder pain). Frequencies of neurologic, vascu-
lar, and allergic AEs were 14 (0.6 %), 14 (0.6 %), and
11 (0.5 % of the study population), respectively
(Table 2). Among SAEs the most frequent categories
were neoplasm, neurologic, and vascular events
(Table 3). There were seven neoplasm cases
representing 0.3 % of the study population, with an
incidence of 0.14/100 PY. The difference in neoplasm
rates between groups was not statistically significant.
Serious neurologic and vascular events were six and
five cases, respectively, representing 0.25 % and
0.21 % of the total population.
Results of the SAE adjudication are reported in Table 4
and the Addendums. In Addendum 1, the adjudications of
the six reviewers regarding the relatedness of the 36 SAEs
are recorded. A majority opinion (as defined by >50 %
agreement) was present in all but two SAEs (#15 and

 #30). Addendum 2 includes the results, by reviewer, of
the relationship of the SAE to the procedure. In total,
19/36 (53 %) of the SAEs were considered as not related
or unlikely to be related to the procedure. There were 13/
36 cases or 36 % in which at least one reviewer indicated
that the SAE was possibly related. Four of the 36 cases,
or 11 %, of SAEs were adjudicated as definitely related to
the procedure by a minority of reviewers (i.e., one or two
of the six reviewers). These four cases were categorized as
neoplasm, pain post procedure, rheumatological, and other.
Addendum 3 contains adjudication information from the
reviewers regarding the relationship of the SAE to the
stem cells or other biologic agent used. Fourteen of the
16 cases (39 %) of the SAEs were categorized as not
related or unlikely to be related, while 16/22 (61 %) were
adjudicated by one or more reviewer as possibly related.
None of the SAEs were considered to be likely or defi-
nitely related to the stem cells or other biologic agent.
Logistic regression modeling revealed that patients in both
the AD and CE groups were more likely to report an AE than
in the SD group; ORs=1.64 (95 % CI; 1.03, 2.61) and 1.68
(95 % CI; 1.11, 2.54), respectively (Table 5). Further analysis
showed that, compared to the SD group, the increase in AE
rate was largely attributable to post-procedure pain in the AD
group, and pain due to DJD in the CE group (Figs. 4 and 5). A
longer follow-up period, older age, and female gender in-
creased the risk of reporting an AE. SAEs were more common
in patients with a longer follow-up period and of older age
[OR=1.51 (95 % CI; 1.37, 1.67) and 1.03 (95 % CI; 1, 1.06),
respectively]. Patients treated for spinal conditions were more
likely to report any AE in comparison with patients undergo-
ing knee procedures [OR=2.17 (95 % CI; 1.13, 4.15)].
Discussion
In the present study we generally observed low rates of
reported AEs among patients treated with MSC proce-
dures, and substantially lower rates of serious or
treatment-related AEs. The finding that the majority of
AEs were post-procedure pain or pain due to DJD that
pre-existed the treatment was not surprising, and consis-
tent with the progressive nature of the treated disorders.
While there have been several publications that have
described the safety and efficacy of bone marrow de-
rived stem cell therapies for orthopaedic applications [1,
7, 9–13, 15], to our knowledge the current investigation
is the most comprehensive report of its kind, following
the largest population for the longest time, and incorpo-
rating an analysis of the relative safety of several dif-
ferent approaches. Our findings are consistent with prior
investigations demonstrating a favorable safety profile
for the percutaneous use of BMC and MSC injections
for the treatment of orthopaedic conditions of the pe-
ripheral and axial joints and surrounding tissues [7, 9,
13, 14]. The SAE rates observed in our study were
substantially lower than those reported for more invasive or-
thopaedic surgical procedures [22]. As an example, the SAE
rate for total knee arthroplasty among 260 patients
at three months follow-up was 6 % [22]. In comparison,
there were 13 possibly related SAEs in the present study

 among 2372 patients, approximately 0.55 %, and only
four of these SAEs (0.17 %) were deemed definitely
related to the procedure. While SAEs related to stem
cell injections can and do occur, prior authors have
indicated that the rate is not greater than that observed
with other types of intra-articular injections, such as
hyaluronic acid injections [23]. The findings in the pres-
ent investigation reinforce this conclusion.
The differences observed in the AE rates between the treat-
ment groups were not directly attributed to the treatment but

 rather to symptoms of progressive degenerative disease. Thus,
the group that was tracked for the longest time (the culture
expanded [CE] group) also had the highest incidence of AEs
resulting from worsening of the treated condition over time.
This observation is consistent with the natural history of pain-
ful degenerative joint disease [24, 25]. Further, the AEs re-
ported in the first months of follow-up differ from those re-
ported after several years of follow-up. For example,
treatment-related AEs, including post-procedural pain, are
more likely to be reported in the earliest few weeks after treat-
ment; while unrelated or more serious AEs, such as neoplastic
and cardiovascular events, are more likely to be reported after
several years of follow-up (i.e., as patients age). The higher
rate of AEs in the adipose graft (AD) BMC group versus the
BMC only group (SD) was largely attributed to post-
procedural pain. This difference may be explained by the
pro-inflammatory effects of residual adipose oil in the
injectate [26].
Of the seven reported cases of neoplasm among the registry
patients, none occurred at the site of implantation despite all
injections being confirmed with imaging guidance. Given the
number and age of the patients followed in the registry, and
the amount of time that the patients were followed, some cases
of cancer were expected. According to the National Cancer
Institute, the annual incidence of cancer in the U.S. population
in 2011 was 0.44 % (438 cases per 100,000 individuals), and
0.78 % in adults 50–64 years [27]. In contrast, we observed a
lower annual cancer rate (0.14 %) among our registry partic-
ipants. These findings are consistent with previous reports
indicating no increased risk of tumor formation following
BMC injections or treatment with culture-expanded MSCs
[9, 11, 13, 15].
Older age and longer follow-up times increased the risk of
reporting of both AEs and SAEs. These findings are explained
both by the fact that morbidity increases with age [28], and
that older patients are more likely to report adverse events

 after orthopaedic procedures [29]. A gender effect was also
observed, in that women were more likely than men to report
AEs. While the nature of the registry data makes it difficult to
determine the reason for this disparity, previous authors have
noted that women are more likely to report post-operative pain
after arthroscopic procedures [30]. Patients who underwent
treatment for degenerative joint and disc changes in the spine
also had a higher rate of AE reporting, including AEs related
to the treatment. Most of the reports in this group were of pain
due to degenerative joint disease and post-procedural pain.
While the explanation for this observation is not readily ap-
parent; it could be due to the nature of the treated condition or
it could be entirely due to differences in treatment efficacy.
Further study would be required to provide more meaningful
insight.
The results of the SAE adjudication by the attending phy-
sician and the panel of independent and blinded reviewers
indicated good agreement on the categorization of pre-
existing conditions, with majority agreement on 34 of 36
SAEs. One of the cases in which a minority of reviewers
judged an SAE to be related concerned a neoplasm that a
single reviewer opined was definitely related to the mechanics
of the draw or re-implant injection procedure (the other five
reviewers judged the relationship to be unlikely or not relat-
ed). The SAE concerned a patient who was diagnosed with
aggressive stomach cancer three weeks following a knee
BMC injection, and who died from the disease at approxi-
mately two months following the injection. The protocol of
the blinded adjudication process made impossible any follow
up with the reviewer for an explanation as to why he or she
believed that the stomach cancer, which likely pre-existed the
procedure in nearly the same state as it was in three weeks
following the procedure, was definitely related.
Another SAE, consisting of severe post-procedure swell-
ing, was judged by two reviewers as definitely needle trauma
related, and two reviewers judged the condition as definitely
caused by the stem cells or other injectates. A rheumatologic
condition was deemed to be definitely related to an injection
by two reviewers. In that case, the patient presented with se-
vere knee swelling after a pre-injection procedure with hyper-
tonic dextrose. The joint was drained and found to be purulent,
but gram stain and culture were negative. Ultimately synovial
fluid crystalline structures were revealed and a diagnosis of
gout was made. Because of the pre-injection complication the
patient did not undergo the stem cell injection.
An SAE following treatment of a degenerated and painful
intervertebral disc was judged to be to be definitely related to
the trauma of the stem cell injection by two reviewers. In that
case, at approximately eight months post-procedure, the patient
sustained an acute disc herniation at the injected level. Three of
the reviewers considered the SAE to be possibly related and
one determined that it was unlikely to be related to the injec-
tion. It is certainly plausible that the needle trauma could have
resulted in injury to the disk annulus, resulting in structural
compromise and the latent herniation.
The strengths of the current study are its large patient pop-
ulation, the fact that data was collected from multiple centers,
that SAEs were adjudicated by multiple independent and
blinded reviewers, that AE/SAE rates of multiple treatment
types are compared, and that unlike prior large studies all
AEs were reported and classified. The main weaknesses of
the current research are that it is based on data accessed from
a treatment registry. Thus, there is no control group with
which the frequency and type of observed illnesses could be
compared. Further, the majority of AEs were patient reported.
Despite the fact that repeated efforts were made to contact
non-responders and all treating physicians were encouraged
to report any possible complications while patients were under
their care, it is possible that adverse events were under-
reported to some degree.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, the present investigation is the first report
to compare the clinical safety of different bone marrow de-
rived stem cell therapies to treat orthopedic diseases and the
first multi-site, large scale report of all AEs in stem cell treated
orthopaedic patients. We found that the lowest rate of adverse
events was among those patients receiving BMC injections
alone, but the higher rate of AEs for BMC plus adipose and
cultured cells was readily explained by the nature of the ther-
apy or the longer follow-up. There was no clinical evidence to
suggest that treatment with MSCs of any type in this study
increased the risk of neoplasm. Although efficacy is best dem-
onstrated with randomized controlled clinical trials, it is rea-
sonable to conclude that the results of the present study add to
the existing body of evidence showing the safety of MSC
based therapies for orthopaedic conditions.
