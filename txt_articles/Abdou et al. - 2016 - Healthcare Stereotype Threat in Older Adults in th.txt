Abstract
Introduction—Healthcare stereotype threat is the threat of being personally reduced to group 
stereotypes that commonly operate within the healthcare domain, including stereotypes regarding 
unhealthy lifestyles and inferior intelligence. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to 
which people fear being judged in healthcare contexts on several characteristics, including race/
ethnicity and age, and to test predictions that experience of such threats would be connected with 
poorer health and negative perceptions of health care.
Methods—Data were collected as part of the 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS). A 
module on healthcare stereotype threat, designed by the research team, was administered to a 
random subset (n=2,048 of the total 20,555) of HRS participants. The final sample for the present 
healthcare stereotype threat experiment consists of 1,479 individuals. Logistic regression was used 
to test whether healthcare stereotype threat was associated with self-rated health, reported 
hypertension, and depressive symptoms, as well as with healthcare-related outcomes, including 
physician distrust, dissatisfaction with health care, and preventative care use.
Results—Seventeen percent of respondents reported healthcare stereotype threat with respect to 
one or more aspects of their identities. As predicted, healthcare stereotype threat was associated 
with higher physician distrust and dissatisfaction with health care, poorer mental and physical 
health (i.e., self-rated health, hypertension, and depressive symptoms), and lower odds of 
receiving the influenza vaccine.
Conclusions—The first of its kind, this study demonstrates that people can experience 
healthcare stereotype threat on the basis of various stigmatized aspects of social identity, and that

 these experiences can be linked with larger health and healthcare-related outcomes, thereby 
contributing to disparities among minority groups.
Introduction
Health disparities exist on the basis of many aspects of identity, including racial/ethnic 
background,1–3 SES,4,5 gender,6,7 age,8,9 as well as indicators of healthy versus nonhealthy 
body weight.10,11 Recently, it has been suggested that health-care stereotype threat (HCST) 
might be one of the overlooked pathways whereby minority and stigmatized identities 
contribute to health disparities.12–15 Stereotype threat is the threat of being personally 
reduced to a group stereotype,16–19 which can lead individuals to avoid stereotype-relevant 
domains. HCST, as a more specific form of stereotype threat, is the threat of being 
personally reduced to group stereotypes that commonly operate within the domain of health 
care, such as stereotypes regarding unhealthy lifestyles and inferior intelligence. The 
experience of HCST—although stemming from social cues and interpersonal experiences 
that result from group-level stereotypes—is a situational, psychosocial phenomenon that the 
authors propose contributes to population-level health disparities. Specifically, the authors 
propose that stereotypes: (1) are salient in healthcare settings for ethnic minorities and 
members of other socially stigmatized groups; (2) can serve as a form of identity threat; and 
(3) ultimately contribute to proximal and distal health disparities. HCST may affect the care 
one receives by impairing working memory20 or creating anxiety,21 which could lead a 
patient to forget or intentionally withhold important information or mistrust medical 
recommendations, and even lead to the avoidance or underutilization of care.13,14 
Importantly, unlike discrimination and other established social determinants of health 
disparities that can be difficult to address or modify, a vast literature shows that stereotype 
threat can be prevented or reduced, such as by emphasizing that a stereotyped trait (e.g., 
intelligence) is malleable,22,23 creating identity-safe environments,24 reframing threat as a 
challenge,25 and utilizing self-affirmation,26–28 among other methods. Stereotype threat can 
also be prevented and reduced from a societal standpoint (discussed in Inzlicht et al.29) and 
within the healthcare domain13,14 via changes in social and health policies that do more to 
promote equality.
The application of stereotype threat to health care is a new phenomenon, with only a handful 
of papers addressing the topic.13,14 In the first published experimental study of HCST, 
Abdou and Fingerhut12 assessed black and white women’s anxiety levels while waiting to 
ostensibly see a physician in a virtual healthcare setting. Those in the HCST condition were 
primed by being asked about their race and ethnic identification at the beginning of the study 
as opposed to at the end and by being exposed to images that were stereotypical (e.g., a 
poster of a young black pregnant woman) or neutral with respect to the reproductive health 
of black women, thus invoking threat or not. As predicted, highly identified black women 
reported higher levels of anxiety under threat than did their white counterparts, a difference 
that disappeared when threat was not present.
Thus far, the work on HCST has been limited in at least two ways. Among these is the 
singular focus, to date, on racial/ethnic identity as the source of HCST.12–15 Second, 
existing work has yet to empirically demonstrate the link between HCST and downstream

 health outcomes and larger health disparities. The objective of the present study was to 
begin remedying these limitations by assessing the extent to which people fear being judged 
in healthcare contexts on a variety of characteristics, not just race/ethnicity, and to connect 
these threats to larger health outcomes. To the extent that stereotype threat theory is 
applicable to the healthcare domain, people who possess a particular stigmatized identity 
should be more likely to report HCST, or the fear of being judged by that identity when 
seeking health care, and the people who are reporting fear of being judged should be more 
likely to experience disparities in health care and broader health outcomes.
Methods
Data Source
Data were collected as part of the 2012 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), 
including a module on HCST, which was designed by the research team. The HRS is a 
longitudinal study that began in 1992 and surveys approximately 26,000 Americans aged 
≥50 years and their spouses every 2 years. The HRS collects extensive data on demographic, 
social, economic, and health characteristics. A random subsample (n=2,048) of the 20,555 
individuals participating in the 2012 wave of HRS was administered the HCST module. A 
total of 1,746 answered preliminary questions, and, of those, 1,479 had seen a doctor in the 
previous 2 years and were asked HCST-related questions. In comparison to those who had 
seen a physician in the past 2 years, those who had not were more likely to report poor self-
rated health and dissatisfaction with health care; they were also far less likely to have had 
the influenza vaccine. Given this, the sample may have been relatively healthier than the 
larger HRS and overall population.
Measures
HCST was measured with three questions across six different aspects of identity. 
Participants were asked: (1) When you visit the doctor, do you worry that the doctor or other 
medical staff make judgments about you because of your [race/ethnic background, gender, 
age, weight, money, other reason]?” and could respond yes or no. The “other reason” 
question was not included in this analysis because, ultimately, it was unclear whether 
individuals had identity-related concepts in mind when they chose this option and, therefore, 
whether the reasons were relevant in the context of HCST. The individuals who reported 
HCST with respect to a particular identity were then asked (2) if they worry that they might 
act in ways that justify such judgments and (3) whether they think that judgments affect the 
quality of health care they receive.
Health outcomes were selected to reflect global physical and mental health status. These 
included self-rated health, diagnosed hypertension, and depressive symptoms. Respondents 
were asked whether their health was excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Those who 
reported fair or poor health were considered to have poor self-rated health. Respondents 
were considered to have hypertension if they had ever been told by a doctor that they had 
high blood pressure or hypertension. Depressive symptoms were defined as feeling sad, 
blue, or depressed for ≥2 weeks in a row in the last 12 months.

 Perceptions of health care were assessed as physician distrust and dissatisfaction with health 
care. Responses to three dichotomous items were averaged to calculate physician distrust, 
including disagreement with the statement (1) you completely trust the doctor’s judgment 
about your medical care and agreement with the statements (2) you worry that the doctor is 
judging you based on the private information you discussed and (3) you worry that the 
doctor is testing you for things that you don’t know about. Dissatisfaction with health care 
was defined as being somewhat or very dissatisfied overall about the quality, cost, or 
convenience of health care. Finally, preventative health care was indicated by whether or not 
in the past 2 years the respondent had received the influenza vaccine.
Control variables included age in years, gender, race/ethnicity, education, household 
income, and lack of health insurance. Race/ethnicity was defined as black, Latino, white, or 
other. Education was categorized as no degree, high school diploma or General Educational 
Development test, some college or college degree, and master’s or other professional degree. 
Household income was the sum of all income reported by the respondent and their spouse (if 
applicable) in dollars. This measure was natural log transformed because of its skewed 
distribution. Lack of health insurance was defined as not having any type of public (e.g., 
Medicare, Medicaid) or private health insurance.
Statistical Analysis
First, the authors examined the demographic and health-related characteristics of the sample 
and examined the prevalence of HCSTs. Second, logistic regression was used to test whether 
each type of HCST was associated with the specific stigmatized social identity (e.g., race 
predicts race-related HCST). Third, the association between HCST and each health outcome 
(poor self-rated health, diagnosed hypertension, and depressive symptoms) was tested in 
logistic regression models controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Fourth, logistic 
regression was used to test whether HCST was associated with dissatisfaction with health 
care and use of preventative care, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and also 
health status (poor self-rated health, six chronic health conditions, and an index of symptoms 
experienced in the past 2 years), as health is likely to influence one’s utilization of health 
care (or contact with the healthcare system). Ordinary least squares regression was 
employed for the model of physician distrust, a continuous measure that was converted to z-
score for analysis. Finally, logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and 
health characteristics associated with belief that one acts in ways that justify judgments and 
that judgments affect care among those who reported one or more threats. All analyses were 
performed using the SVY command, which accounts for complex sampling design in Stata, 
version 13.1.
Results
Table 1 summarizes the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample as well as 
descriptive statistics for the HCST measures and dependent variables. Mean age was 65.9 
(SD=10.1) years, and 56% were female. Approximately 10% were black, 5% were Latino, 
82% were white, and 3% were other. The majority of respondents (56%) had a high school

 diploma or General Educational Development test. Median household income was $47,000 
and about 5% lacked health insurance.
Seventeen percent of respondents reported HCST with respect to one or more aspect of their 
identities, with the prevalence of specific types of HCST ranging from just >2% for race/
ethnicity and gender to 8.3% for age and weight (Table 1). Logistic regression results 
indicated that age was positively associated with age-related HCST (OR=1.03, p=0.005). 
Compared with whites, blacks (OR=7.44, p<0.001) and Latinos (OR=11.05, p<0.001), but 
not those of other race, had higher odds of reporting race-related HCST. Household income 
and level of education were not significantly associated with money-related HCST, except 
that relative to those with no degree, those with a master’s or professional degree had 
marginally statistically significant lower odds of reporting HCST (OR=0.18, p=0.053). 
Gender was not significantly associated with gender-related HCST; however, the OR was in 
the predicted direction (with women reporting higher levels of HCST than men). Finally, 
compared with normal-weight individuals, those who were overweight (OR=3.58, p=0.004) 
or obese (OR=25.40, p<0.001) had significantly higher odds of reporting weight-related 
HCST.
Regarding health outcomes (Table 2), logistic regression analyses showed that those who 
reported experiencing HCST on the basis of one or more aspects of identity had higher odds 
of poor self-rated health, hypertension, and depressive symptoms compared with those who 
experienced no HCST, holding sociodemographic characteristics constant.
Findings for healthcare perceptions and use of preventative care are summarized in Table 3. 
Ordinary least squares regression results for physician distrust indicated that those who 
experienced one or more types of HCST reported higher average physician distrust, with a 
greater effect size among those who perceived two or more types of HCST. Similarly, those 
who reported two or more types of HCST had higher odds of being dissatisfied with health 
care and had lower odds of receiving the influenza vaccine compared with those who 
reported no threat.
Finally, among those who reported one or more types of HCST, those who reported two or 
more types of HCST had 3.8 times greater odds of worrying that they acted in ways that 
justified judgment(s) by healthcare providers and 8.3 times greater odds of thinking that 
judgment(s) by healthcare providers affect the quality of care they receive (Table 4).
Discussion
This naturalistic observation of older adults is an important demonstration of the existence 
of HCST. In addition to corroborating the first set of experimental findings to exist on the 
topic of HCST (i.e., Abdou and Fingerhut12), this study demonstrates that HCST exists in 
relation to aspects of social identity beyond race/ethnicity (e.g., age, gender). Additionally, 
these data are the first to show that the experience of HCST is associated with important 
proximal and distal health consequences. Specifically, those reporting one or more types of 
HCST were more likely to exhibit poorer global physical and mental health, as indicated by 
self-rated health, diagnosed hypertension, and depressive symptoms. HCST was also

 associated with greater distrust of physicians and dissatisfaction with health care. Finally, 
HCST was associated with lower odds of receiving the influenza vaccine, a preventative 
measure that is now largely accessible via coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and 
recommended for all individuals aged 50 years and older.
Given the links presented here between HCST, on one hand, and mental and physical health 
outcomes, perceptions of healthcare providers, and use of preventative care, on the other 
hand, more research and attention to policy implications are warranted. As for research, data 
are needed to better understand how each of the identity dimensions assessed in the current 
study become activated within healthcare contexts, as well as the ways in which each 
identity becomes more versus less important across life stages. Additionally, though the 
current study improves on other stereotype threat research, and HCST research specifically, 
by examining threats along multiple identity dimensions, it is limited in that it treats each 
identity as a unique, orthogonal construct. An important next step is to engage 
intersectionality theory to examine specific combinations of threats and what they mean for 
the health outcomes examined here. For example, to the extent that gender and weight create 
threats within healthcare environments, how do the experiences of overweight women differ 
from overweight men and average-weight women and men? In what ways do various 
combinations of identities predict exacerbation or perhaps amelioration of threat?
From a policy standpoint, interventions borrowed from other areas of stereotype threat 
research need to be examined and introduced in the healthcare domain.30 As an example, 
research has shown that creating an identity-safe environment by emphasizing equality and 
similarity between individuals of different groups can reduce the effects of stereotype 
threat.24 Research such as this shows that reducing the threat related to a particular identity 
dimension can ameliorate the negative consequences generally associated with identity 
threat. However, complicating matters, the present study shows that threat can be 
experienced across a variety of identity dimensions, perhaps simultaneously. Given this, we 
need to better understand how influencing threat based on one identity may (or may not) 
transfer to other identities. Some research has suggested that general cues that diversity, 
broadly construed and operationalized, is valued can reduce identity threat based on any 
particular identity or perhaps set of identities.31 As a result, cues placed in doctor’s offices 
and hospitals that signify that the spaces are identity safe, such as visible nondiscrimination 
polices, may reduce the experience of HCST overall. Finally, research has shown that 
providing information about stereotype threat to potentially susceptible individuals can arm 
them in the face of a threat experience.32 In other words, simply knowing that stereotype 
threat exists and is potentially present in a given context can help individuals to combat it. 
Although such interventions have largely been conducted in the academic arena, similar 
effects should be found in other domains as well, and are worth exploring in the context of 
health care.
Limitations
The data and sample were limited in a variety of ways that should be accounted for in future 
research. To reduce participant burden, only participants who had seen the doctor in the 
previous 2 years were presented the HCST items. Future research should also include those

 who have not recently seen a doctor, as one hypothesized outcome of HCST is avoidance of 
the healthcare domain. Given this, the percentage of individuals reporting threat or multiple 
threats may be under-reported in this sample. Additionally, the sample is comprised of older 
adults. There is no reason to believe that the process of HCST works differently in younger 
versus older individuals; however, it may be the case that as some identities become more 
versus less salient over time, threat related to those identities waxes or wanes with age. 
Finally, and also related to efforts to minimize participant burden, the module questions (i.e., 
When you visit the doctor, do you worry that the doctor or other medical staff make 
judgments about you because of your gender?) were answered as yes/no questions. Using a 
dichotomous variable greatly restricted the variability in responses and likely contributed to 
a lower proportion of the module sample reporting HCST at all. Future research should use a 
response set with a wider range to capture subtle variations in the experience of HCST. The 
findings of the present study are particularly compelling in light of such limitations. For all 
of the practical reasons listed here, the authors expect that these are highly conservative 
estimates of the range and consequences of HCST in general and with respect to specific 
aspects of identity, including but not necessarily limited to race/ethnicity, gender, age, 
weight, and social class.
Conclusions
The study presented here represents an important first step in demonstrating that people can 
experience HCST on the basis of various stigmatized aspects of social identity and that these 
different types of HCST can be linked with larger health and healthcare-related outcomes. 
Theoretically significant, this work extends stereotype threat research beyond academics and 
other performance domains into the public health arena. It also examines longer-term 
consequences of stereotype threat that are not typically measured, including avoidance of 
domains that are directly critical to livelihood, such as healthcare utilization. Practically 
significant, this research provides new insight into the persistence of health disparities and 
their prevention, including the need to identify alternative approaches to the delivery of 
health services and health communications that may inadvertently invoke HCST, 
particularly when targeting specific or high-risk groups.
