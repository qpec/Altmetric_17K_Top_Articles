The number of available donor organs limits lung transplantation, the only lifesaving therapy
for the increasing population of patients with end-stage lung disease. A prevalent etiology of
injury that renders lungs unacceptable for transplantation is gastric aspiration, a deleterious
insult to the pulmonary epithelium. Currently, severely damaged donor lungs cannot be
salvaged with existing devices or methods. Here we report the regeneration of severely
damaged lungs repaired to meet transplantation criteria by utilizing an interventional cross-
circulation platform in a clinically relevant swine model of gastric aspiration injury. Enabled by
cross-circulation with a living swine, prolonged extracorporeal support of damaged lungs
results in significant improvements in lung function, cellular regeneration, and the develop-
ment of diagnostic tools for non-invasive organ evaluation and repair. We therefore propose
that the use of an interventional cross-circulation platform could enable recovery of other-
wise unsalvageable lungs and thus expand the donor organ pool.

rgan transplantation has overcome significant technical,
immunological, and ethical hurdles to become a life-
saving treatment1. The full potential of organ trans-
plantation remains constrained by the global shortage of organs—
a problem that has been described as “the greatest crisis facing
biomedicine today”2. Notably, up to 80% of donated lungs are not
utilized3, often as a result of injury at the time of death (e.g.,
trauma, pulmonary contusion, aspiration, ventilator-associated
lung injury). Major efforts to expand the donor pool are under-
way4–6, including ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), which is under
clinical investigation as a means to evaluate and improve mar-
ginal quality donor lungs7. With the use of hyperosmotic and
blood-based perfusates, EVLP has been shown to decrease pul-
monary edema and enable ~6 h of normothermic perfusion prior
to transplantation8,9. EVLP is also used as an investigational
platform for the delivery of therapeutic agents including anti-
biotics10, pulmonary surfactant11,12, immunomodulatory viral
vectors13,14, and mesenchymal stem cells15,16.
Despite the clinical use of EVLP since its introduction in 2012
and expansion of criteria for donor lungs, the annual number of
lung transplants in the United States has not dramatically
increased17. Consequently, there is a compelling need to extend
organ recovery capabilities beyond the limited category of mar-
ginal lungs to severely damaged lungs, such as those injured by
aspiration of gastric contents (hydrochloric acid, bile acids, gastric
enzymes, and food particulates18,19). Gastric aspiration results in
damage to the pulmonary epithelium, leading to pneumonitis and
respiratory insufficiency18. Previous attempts to recover lungs
injured by gastric aspiration using EVLP have been unsuccess-
ful20, having resulted in increased edema21 and failure to reduce
levels of inflammatory cytokines22 or improve tissue morphol-
ogy23 (Supplementary Table 1–3).
We previously reported the development of an extracorporeal
organ support platform that utilized cross-circulation to radically
extend the duration of time that lungs can be maintained outside the
body (normothermic perfusion time 37.7 ± 1.8 h; total extracorporeal
preservation time 56.2 ± 0.1 h)24. Following these prolonged extra-
corporeal preservation times, lungs met all transplantation criteria
and showed maintenance of pulmonary vasoregulation, micro-
vascular and bronchial epithelial tight junctions, alveolar type II
pneumocyte surfactant recycling, airway submucosal gland secretory
activity, and a coordinated mucociliary escalator. Based on these
results, we hypothesized that normothermic perfusion via cross-
circulation could enable therapeutic interventions leading to func-
tional recovery and regeneration of severely damaged lungs.
In this study, we use an established clinically relevant large
animal model of gastric aspiration to recapitulate severe injury
that currently renders a large number of donated lungs unsal-
vageable for clinical transplantation. We investigate the ability of
the cross-circulation platform to: (i) provide prolonged nor-
mothermic extracorporeal support of severely damaged lungs
outside the body, and (ii) enable continuous assessment of lung
regeneration at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. Severely
damaged lungs are subjected to multiple therapeutic interventions
—bronchoalveolar lavage, surfactant replacement, and alveolar
recruitment—on an interventional cross-circulation platform that
provided physiologic systemic regulation. We also apply non-
invasive diagnostics (exosomes, surface thermography) in extra-
corporeal lungs on cross-circulation support, and establish
benchmarks of lung repair and regeneration and corresponding
scope of analyses (Supplementary Table 4).
Results
Experimental design. To induce lung injury, gastric contents
(2 mL kg−1; pH 2) were delivered into a single lung of an
anesthetized swine via flexible video bronchoscopy, and an acute
injury was allowed to develop for 6 h (Fig. 1a; Supplementary
Movie 2). Progression of lung injury was assessed every 2 h by
radiography, bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis,
and serologic and hemogas analyses (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 5).
Upon explant, extensive lung consolidation, cellular derangement,
peribronchial edema, and regions of alveolar hemorrhage, edema,
and pervasive infiltration of leukocytes were observed (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1). Lungs were cannulated, and pulmonary venous drainage
was managed with cannulas placed through a vascular bio-bridge to
enable single lung functional assessment (i.e., gas exchange in injured
and control lungs; Fig. 1c–g; Supplementary Fig. 2a–h). An endo-
tracheal tube was inserted and secured in the extracorporeal lungs to
enable continuous ventilation throughout the duration of the study.
Periodic use of bronchial blockers enabled single lung assessment of
compliance of injured and control lungs (Fig. 1h–j; Supplementary
Fig. 2i–m). Following cannulation of the internal jugular veins of the
recipient, lungs were connected to the extracorporeal circuit and
cross-circulation was established. All cross-circulation procedures
were conducted in an operating room and utilized clinical equipment
and supporting devices (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Validation of in vivo lung injury after gastric aspiration. Video
bronchoscopy was used to confirm unilateral delivery of gastric
contents into lungs (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Movie 2). Six hours
after in vivo delivery of gastric contents, chest X-rays showed
marked unilateral lung injury characterized by increased radio-
pacity, basilar atelectasis, and areas of consolidation with air
bronchograms (Fig. 2a). Bronchoscopy revealed severe unilateral
airway inflammation, edema, and mucus secretions (Fig. 2b)
resulting from the insult of gastric contents. Lung donors
experienced hemodynamic instability (increased heart rate,
decreased MAP; Fig. 2c, d), significantly decreased gas exchange
capacity (Fig. 2f–h), and developed a severe inflammatory
response (significant elevation in levels of IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-
6, IL-8, TNFα in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, p <
0.001; Fig. 2i), consistent with previously described effects of large
volume aspiration25. Significantly more inflammatory cells,
including lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, and mast cells,
were observed in BAL fluid from injured lungs compared to BAL
fluid from control lungs (Fig. 2j; Supplementary Fig. 1j).
Histologic
and
immunohistochemical
evaluation
revealed
dramatic inflammatory response, cellular derangement, and
peribronchial edema, with localized regions of alveolar hemor-
rhage, alveolar edema, pervasive infiltration of leukocytes (Fig. 2k;
Supplementary Fig. 1e–h), perivascular edema, vascular intimal
thickening, and extravasation of inflammatory cells (Fig. 2l) in
injured lungs. Immunostaining for caspase 3, a marker of early
apoptosis, showed numerous apoptotic cells throughout injured
lungs 6 h after gastric aspiration, while apoptotic cells were very
rarely observed in control lungs (Fig. 2m). Pathologic assessments
were performed in a randomized and blinded fashion according
to
a
previously
established
protocol24,26,27
(Supplementary
Table 6) to obtain lung injury scores of injured and control
lungs at baseline and 6 h after gastric aspiration. Injured lungs
received significantly higher injury scores than control lungs
across all injury categories (Fig. 2n; Supplementary Fig. 1k).
Therapeutic intervention in lungs during cross-circulation.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (performed with a flexible video
bronchoscope, Supplementary Movie 4), surfactant replace-
ment, and alveolar recruitment maneuvers were conducted
according to a specified sequence of interventions and func-
tional assessments (Fig. 1b). Analysis of BAL fluid from
injured lungs demonstrated significant decreases in turbidity,

proteinaceous contents, and cell counts (0 h, 1816 ± 244 cells;
36 h, 120 ± 31 cells; p < 0.001) over 36 h of cross-circulation
(Fig. 3a–c). The concentration of pepsin in BAL fluid from
injured lungs also decreased significantly over 36 h of cross-
circulation (0 h, 111.9 ± 43.2 ng mL−1; 36 h, 5.8 ± 3.9 ng mL−1;
p < 0.001), while the pH (0 h, 4.5 ± 0.2) normalized to the pH
of BAL fluid from control lungs (5.5 ± 0.1) by 12 h of cross-
circulation (Fig. 3d, e). Total protein in BAL fluid from injured
lungs gradually decreased over 36 h of cross-circulation (0 h,
1.51 ± 0.29 mg mL−1; 36 h, 1.04 ± 0.16 mg mL−1) but remained
consistently elevated compared to BAL fluid from control

 lungs (0 h, 0.25 ± 0.13 mg mL−1; 36 h, 0.28 ± 0.18 mg mL−1,
Fig. 3f).
Interestingly, the concentration of exosomes in BAL fluid from
injured lungs was significantly elevated at 12 h of cross-
circulation (injured, 8.96 × 1015 ± 2.24 × 1015 particles mL−1;
control, 4.88 × 1014 ± 3.90 × 1014 particles mL−1; p < 0.01) but
trended downward between 12 and 36 h of cross-circulation
(Fig. 3g). Correlation between injury/inflammation and exosome
concentration has been previously reported in other pathologic
conditions28,29, and these results suggest that the concentration of
exosomes in BAL fluid may serve as a diagnostic marker of
extracorporeal lung injury and recovery. Exosomes in BAL fluids

 from injured and control lungs had comparable mean diameters
and size distributions (Supplementary Fig. 4d–f). In parallel, the
effect of interventional cross-circulation on the inflammatory
response in injured lungs was analyzed by quantification of
cytokines in BAL fluid. GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4,
IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, M30, and TNFα all decreased over 36 h of
cross-circulation (Fig. 3h, Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary
Fig. 4c).
Following airway lavage, exogenous surfactant was delivered
via video bronchoscopy into each lobe of injured lungs (Fig. 3i, j;
Supplementary Fig. 8g), and was observed advancing distally
through the airway tree during positive pressure ventilation,
consistent with the transport and deposition of liquid plugs
through small airways30,31 (Supplementary Movie 5). Transmis-
sion electron microscopy confirmed the presence of abundant
surfactant in distal airspaces (Fig. 3k; Supplementary Fig. 8h).

 Dynamic compliance of injured lungs consistently increased after
surfactant delivery and throughout the duration of interventional
cross-circulation (Fig. 3l). Following surfactant replacement,
alveolar recruitment maneuvers were performed by adjusting
ventilator settings to recruit additional lung volumes32,33. Gross
imaging of the lung surface (Fig. 3m, Supplementary Movie 6)
and histologic analysis (Fig. 3n) showed that atelectatic regions
throughout the injured lung were successfully recruited over 36 h
of interventional cross-circulation. Peak inspiratory pressures
(PIP) during standard ventilation gradually decreased from 20.6
± 5.8 cmH2O to 11.5 ± 1.7 cmH2O over 36 h of cross-circulation
(Fig. 3o), consistent with lung recovery and recruitment of
additional lung volumes.
Functional assessment of lungs during cross-circulation. Lung
weight significantly decreased over 18 h (0 h, 0.75 ± 0.06 kg; 18 h,
0.61 ± 0.05 kg, p < 0.05) and remained stable through 36 h (18 h,
0.61 ± 0.05 kg; 36 h, 0.54 ± 0.06 kg, p > 0.05) of cross-circulation
(Supplementary Fig. 5e). Trans-pulmonary pressure gradients
(TPG) were tightly maintained at 5–15 mmHg throughout cross-
circulation (Supplementary Fig. 3j). Significant improvements of
pressure–volume (PV) loops and dynamic compliance of injured
lungs were observed throughout 36 h of cross-circulation. Initi-
ally, injured lungs displayed significant derangement of PV loops
(PIP: 28.7 ± 4.4 cmH2O, volume: 67.9 ± 16.3 mL; injured, 0 h, red
loop, Fig. 4a) and significantly reduced dynamic compliance
(injured,
2.83 ± 1.86 mL
cmH2O−1;
control,
23.03 ± 1.84 mL
cmH2O−1; p < 0.01; Fig. 4b). After 36 h of interventional cross-
circulation, injured lungs recovered normal hysteresis (PIP: 17.9
± 3.6 cmH2O, volume: 186.6 ± 23.8 mL; injured, 36 h, blue loop,
Fig. 4a) similar to that of control lungs (PIP: 14.5 ± 2.1 cmH2O,
volume: 227.5 ± 12.4 mL; control, 36 h, dark blue loop, Fig. 4a).
Injured lungs maintained on 40% FiO2 had an average initial
PaO2 of 36 ± 28 mmHg, corresponding to an average initial PaO2/
FiO2 ratio of 90 ± 70 mmHg, and demonstrated steady improve-
ments in gas exchange function through the first 12 h of cross-
circulation (12 h, PaO2: 257 ± 57 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 643 ± 144
mmHg). Control lungs maintained an average PaO2 of 309 ± 57
mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 of 773 ± 142 mmHg (Fig. 4c).
Injured and control lungs demonstrated differential capacities
to exchange gas. Response to increasing minute ventilation by
100% and increasing FiO2 from 40 to 100% was demonstrated by
differences (Δ) in baseline and challenge levels of pulmonary
artery and vein hemogases (Fig. 4h), ΔpO2 (oxygenation,
Fig. 4d, f) and ΔpCO2 (ventilation, Fig. 4e, g). Notably, injured
lungs achieved ΔpO2 values of control lungs after 12 h of cross-
circulation (Fig. 4d) and ΔpCO2 values of control lungs after 30 h
of cross-circulation (Fig. 4e).
Recovery of injured lungs during cross-circulation. Injured
lungs had sizable areas of consolidation and discoloration sug-
gestive of pulmonary edema and hemorrhage that were reduced
after 18 h and resolved after 36 h of cross-circulation (Fig. 5a;
Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). Radiography revealed severe unilateral
injury with marked lobar and multi-focal opacities and the pre-
sence of air bronchograms throughout injured lungs (Fig. 5b;
Supplementary Fig. 5d), while contralateral control lungs main-
tained normal radiographic appearance. Progressive clearance
was observed throughout interventional cross-circulation, with
recovery of aerated lung volume in injured lungs after 36 h.
Thermography was used to assess global and local changes
in lung surface temperatures throughout 36 h of cross-circulation.
Injured and contralateral control lungs were rewarmed in the
normothermic
organ
chamber
and
achieved
steady
state
surface
temperatures
within
30 min
of
reperfusion
(Supplementary Fig. 3l, m; Supplementary Movie 3). Notably,
through 18 h of cross-circulation, injured lungs showed more
heterogeneous and elevated surface temperatures compared to
contralateral regions of control lungs (Fig. 5c; Supplementary
Fig.
8a).
Regions
of
injured
lungs
with
elevated
surface
temperatures correlated with areas of consolidation and hemor-
rhage, consistent with perfused parenchyma with diminished
ventilation.
After
36 h
of
cross-circulation,
no
significant
differences in surface temperatures were observed across injured
lungs or between injured and control lungs (Fig. 5c, d;
Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). These results suggest that surface
thermography is a useful diagnostic imaging modality for non-
invasive assessment of extracorporeal lung recovery.
Lung surface regions (diameter: 8 mm) were topically cooled
by contact with a hypothermic probe (Fig. 5f; Supplementary
Fig. 8c, d). In control lungs, surface temperatures returned to
baseline within 20 s (Supplementary Fig. 8e), while injured lungs
consistently demonstrated protracted recovery, requiring more
than 45 s to return to baseline (Fig. 5g; Supplementary Movie 7).
Differences in surface temperatures between topically cooled
regions and surrounding areas were quantified using video
thermography and image analysis software. Temperature differ-
ences decreased exponentially over time (Fig. 5e, Supplementary
Fig. 8f), with time constants for injured lungs (0 h, τ = 71.4 s;
12 h, τ = 39.1 s; 24 h, τ = 38.5 s; 36 h, τ = 36.2 s) gradually
decreasing to values of time constants for control lungs (0 h, τ
= 33.3 s; 12 h, τ = 30.3 s; 24 h, τ = 32.2 s; 36 h, τ = 30.3 s). These
results suggest that in addition to global surface thermography,
regional thermodynamic imaging may be a useful diagnostic tool
for real-time, non-invasive assessment of extracorporeal organs to
identify and monitor injury resulting in ventilation–perfusion
mismatch.
The airways of injured lungs were inflamed and clearly
distinguishable from airways of control lungs. After 18 h of
interventional cross-circulation, airway bronchoscopy showed
reduced erythema of injured airways, with resolving inflamma-
tion of the bronchial mucosa (Fig. 5k). After 36 h, only minimal
residual inflammation was observed in airways of injured lungs.
Histologic analyses of control lungs revealed normal tissue
histomorphology with intact columnar bronchial epithelium and
alveolar architecture, and no evidence of pulmonary edema or
inflammation throughout 36 h of cross-circulation (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5f, 7c), consistent with previous studies wherein our
group demonstrated robust maintenance of healthy lungs over
36 h of cross-circulation support24.
In contrast, injured lungs displayed pervasive inflammation
and disruption of the lung parenchyma, with extensive airway
congestion, interstitial and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, leuko-
cyte infiltration, leakage of lymphatic and plasma proteins, and
cellular debris (Fig. 5h, 0 h). Scanning and transmission electron
microscopy showed severe tissue derangement, exudation, and
loss of stereotypical saccular structures (Fig. 5i, 0 h), with alveolar
spaces containing particulate debris, extravascular erythrocytes
consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar septal thickening,
neutrophil extravasation, and an impaired blood–gas barrier with
severely compromised respiratory epithelium, disruption of type I
pneumocyte cell membranes, and atypical cytomorphology of
type II pneumocytes (Fig. 5j, 0 h; Supplementary Fig. 7b).
Markers of injury were drastically reduced after 18 h of
interventional cross-circulation, with evidence of partial restora-
tion of the alveolar epithelial lining, and complete resolution by
36 h of interventional cross-circulation (Fig. 5h–j, 36 h; Supple-
mentary Fig. 7b).
Pathologic assessment of injured and control lungs was
performed in a randomized blinded fashion to obtain categorical
and composite lung injury scores according to a previously

 established scoring rubric24 (Supplementary Table 6). Lung injury
was evaluated by quantification of polymorphonuclear (PMN)
cells in airways and alveoli, early and late apoptotic cells,
interstitial and alveolar edema, and interstitial infiltrates (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6). Lung injury scores trended downward in all
categories over 36 h of interventional cross-circulation (Fig. 5l;
Supplementary Fig. 5g). Apoptosis was the lung injury category
with the most significant reduction in injury score, decreasing
from 3.0 at initiation to 0.3 after 36 h of interventional cross-
circulation. Control lungs showed no changes in categorical or
composite lung injury scores across 36 h of cross-circulation
(Fig. 5l; Supplementary Fig. 5h). The difference in composite lung
injury scores between injured and control lungs decreased
throughout 36 h of cross-circulation from 12.1 to 5.7 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5i), suggesting a high degree of lung recovery.
Regeneration of injured lungs during cross-circulation. Silver
reticulin staining of injured lungs demonstrated dense cellular
debris and mucus within the bronchial lumen, peribronchial
edema, and consolidation of alveoli, consistent with severe acute
lung injury and disruption of the pulmonary epithelium. Alcian
blue staining showed abundant trans-epithelial migration of
neutrophils into the airway lumen through pseudostratified air-
way epithelium, and apparent loss of secretory vesicles containing
mucus in goblet cells. Periodic acid-Schiff and pentachrome
staining showed damaged, discontinuous columnar epithelium
with exposed basement membrane, inflammatory cells, and loss
of airway cilia (Fig. 6a). After 36 h of cross-circulation, con-
ducting airways of injured lungs exhibited resolution of edema
and inflammation, clearance of luminal debris consistent with the
histologic appearance of proximal airways in control lungs, trace
evidence of neutrophil infiltration, presence of mucus-filled
granules in goblet cells, and intact columnar epithelium with
reconstituted ciliated brush border (Fig. 6a). In the respiratory
zone of injured lungs, retention of structural fibers in the alveolar
extracellular matrix, clearance of alveolar edema and inflamma-
tory cell infiltration, absence of extravascular erythrocytes,
reduced perivascular edema, and restored vascular histomor-
phology were observed (Fig. 6b, c).
Injured lungs also contained significantly more neutrophils
than control lungs, with significantly greater myeloperoxidase

 (MPO) activity in injured lung parenchyma (Fig. 6d, e). By 18 h
of cross-circulation, neutrophil numbers and MPO activity were
significantly decreased and maintained within normal ranges
through 36 h of cross-circulation, consistent with histologic
evaluations (Fig. 6a–c). Additionally, the number of CD163+
macrophages in injured lungs decreased to normal (control)
levels by 36 h of cross-circulation (p < 0.001, Fig. 6f). Over the
same period, the high initial levels of caspase 3 and TUNEL
significantly decreased, and apoptotic cells were rarely observed
in injured lungs, indicating clearance of dying and dead cells
(Fig. 6g; Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Interestingly, mitochondrial
activity showed no significant differences in metabolism of
injured or control lungs during 36 h of cross-circulation support
(Fig. 6h).
As aspiration of gastric contents incurs a severe chemical injury
to the respiratory epithelium, especially to the type I pneumocytes
that comprise the majority of the alveolar surface34, the integrity
of the alveolar epithelium was assessed. Expression of aquaporin
5, an integral membrane protein that functions as a water channel
and marker of type I pneumocytes, was largely lost following
aspiration of gastric contents but recovered during interventional
cross-circulation (Fig. 6i; Supplementary Fig. 7a). Initially, total
depletion of epithelial tight junctions (zonula occludens-3, ZO-3)
and loss of barrier function was observed in injured lungs, but the
number of tight junctions increased by 18 h of cross-circulation
(Fig. 6j; Supplementary Fig. 7d). Expression of surfactant protein
C (SPC), a marker of type II pneumocytes, was negligible in
injured lungs but became increasingly abundant by 36 h of cross-
circulation, with clear punctate distributions suggesting normal
intracellular localization within lamellar bodies (Fig. 6k; Supple-
mentary Fig. 7e). Viability and function of type II pneumocytes
after 36 h of cross-circulation were confirmed by uptake of
BODIPY-labeled surfactant protein B (BODIPY-SPB) delivered
into distal regions of injured lungs (Fig. 6m).
Regeneration of pulmonary endothelium after aspiration of
gastric contents was also assessed by analysis of the injured

Discussion
We describe the application of interventional cross-circulation—a
strategy for prolonged, systemically regulated normothermic
extracorporeal organ support—to regenerate severely damaged
lungs (Supplementary Movie 1). Our results suggest that lungs
injured by gastric aspiration, a common lung injury rendering
donor lungs unsuitable for transplantation: (i) can be maintained
on cross-circulation support without decline in lung function or
tissue integrity, (ii) are amenable to repeated therapeutic inter-
ventions, and (iii) display evidence of cellular regeneration and
improved function over the course of 36 h.
Aspiration of gastric contents was used as an injury model due
to its: (i) reproducibility and established protocols21,36, (ii)
severity of functional decline and tissue derangement, and (iii)
clinical relevance in the context of acute lung injury and lung
transplantation. Lung injury occurs in two distinct phases37. In
the first phase (0–2 h after aspiration), damage results in the
disruption of alveolar type I cell membranes and increased
microvascular permeability. Alterations in the blood–gas barrier
lead to extravasation of fluid and protein into the airways and
alveoli, leading to pulmonary edema, decreased compliance, and
progressive hypoxia38. In the second phase (2–6 h after aspira-
tion), an inflammatory cascade results in neutrophil migration
and the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and
TNFα by activated alveolar macrophages39,40. These processes in
conjunction with the release of reactive oxygen species, free
radicals, and proteases by infiltrating immune cells41,42 exacer-
bate lung injury.
Normothermic cross-circulation allowed for 36 h of repeated
therapeutic interventions (Fig. 1b) that aided in the recovery of
damaged lungs. Airway lavage was effective in ameliorating the
caustic effects of gastric aspiration by removing particulate and
cellular debris43 and by neutralizing pH, thereby decreasing pro-
teolytic enzyme concentration and activity (Fig. 3, a–h). While the
delivery of exogenous surfactants effectively replenishes depleted
and degraded endogenous surfactants and improves compliance44,
beneficial effects only occur after inhibitory plasma proteins and
fluid are removed by lavage45. Accordingly, in our therapeutic
intervention regimen, surfactant replacement was performed after
bronchoalveolar lavage. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers improve
ventilation–perfusion matching and arterial oxygenation46, and
have been shown to improve clinical outcomes47. Administration
of surfactant enhances the spatial distribution of lung ventilation
via recruitment, which recovers gas exchange48 through restora-
tion of ventilation–perfusion match.
Pepsin, a biomarker of gastric aspiration49,50, has recently been
linked to allograft injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in
transplant patients51. Pepsin-induced cytotoxicity and release of
IL-6 and IL-8 peaks at pH 1.5–2.552. After 12 h of cross-
circulation and repeated bronchoalveolar lavage, pepsin con-
centrations in BAL fluid significantly decreased, pH of BAL fluid
normalized
to
pH > 5,
and
IL-6
and
IL-8
concentrations
decreased significantly (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4). Elevated
levels of IL-8 in BAL fluid perpetuate aspiration injury via IL-8
dependent mechanisms53,54. Notably, initially high levels of IL-8
in injured lungs normalized to control levels after 12 h of inter-
ventional cross-circulation. Similarly, levels of other key inflam-
matory cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, IL-1β, and TNFα) decreased
significantly in BAL fluid from injured lungs over the course
of 36 h of interventional cross-circulation (Fig. 3h, Supplementary
Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 9). Gastric aspiration also increa-
ses
susceptibility
to
respiratory
pathogens
and
bacterial
infections55,56. Microbial cultures of BAL fluids from injured and
control lungs contained normal respiratory flora and were
negative for pathologic growth, demonstrating that repeated
interventions in extracorporeal lungs can be performed without
introducing pathogens.
Over 36 h of cross-circulation, injured lungs showed recovery
of mechanical compliance to 68% of the average compliance of
control lungs—a more than six-fold improvement. Significant
changes in pressure–volume (PV) loops were consistent with this
degree of recovery and did not resemble stereotypical PV loop
hysteresis until after 24 h of cross-circulation (Fig. 4a, b). The
initial average PaO2/FiO2 of injured lungs was <90 mmHg (11%
of the average PaO2/FiO2 in control lungs) and increased to >640
mmHg (83% of the average PaO2/FiO2 in control lungs). Notably,
following 36 h of cross-circulation there was no significant dif-
ference between the PaO2/FiO2 of injured and control lungs
(Fig. 4c).
Lung injury scores consistently decreased across all categories,
with the greatest reductions in alveolar PMN cells, edema, and
apoptosis (Fig. 5l, Supplementary Fig. 5g–i; Supplementary
Fig. 6). Notably, we demonstrated: (i) longitudinal expression and
regeneration of cell surface markers of the pulmonary epithelium
and endothelium, and tight and gap junction proteins, (ii)
recovery of functional subcellular structures (e.g., intracellular
vesicles), and (iii) cellular function and integrity throughout 36 h
of extracorporeal support (Fig. 6).
Acute lung injury affects the alveolar epithelium and micro-
vascular endothelium, and specifically reduces the expression of

 aquaporin 5, which plays an essential role in water transport57.
Following aspiration, aquaporin 5 was drastically reduced in
injured lungs. After 36 h of interventional cross-circulation,
aquaporin 5 expression was similar in injured and control lungs
(Fig. 6i, Supplementary Fig. 7a). Additionally, epithelial tight
junction protein ZO-3 and microvascular tight junction protein
ZO-1 displayed similar expression patterns of recovery, with very
low initial levels and significantly higher levels reaching those in
control lungs after 36 h of cross-circulation. These data, along
with decreased lung weight (Supplementary Fig. 5e), improved
gas exchange and compliance (Fig. 4), and decreased alveolar
edema observed by light and electron microscopy (Figs. 5, 6),
strongly suggest that interventional cross-circulation enabled
significant cellular regeneration in the airway and vascular
compartments, resulting in functional restoration of the alveolar-
capillary membrane in extracorporeal lungs.
Decrease in surfactant protein C, a marker of type II pneu-
mocytes58, in distal regions of injured lungs resulted in the loss of
surfactant-filled lamellar bodies in type II cells. After 36 h of
interventional cross-circulation, significant increases in SPC
expression
and
restoration
of
intracellular
surfactant-filled
lamellar bodies were observed (Fig. 6k, l). Airway regeneration
was demonstrated by the restoration of: (i) contiguous type I cell
membranes, (ii) a ciliated epithelial brush border, and (iii) sub-
cellular structures including mucus-filled vesicles in airway goblet
cells and surfactant-filled lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells.
These data suggest extensive epithelial cellular regeneration in the
airway that has not been demonstrated by other lung support
systems (Supplementary Table 1–3). In addition, increased
expression of connexin 43 (Fig. 6o, p) correlated with the
recovery of severely damaged lungs over 36 h of support, during
which the injured pulmonary vascular network not only remained
viable but also substantially regenerated. We hypothesize that the
degree of cellular regeneration achieved is the result of the ben-
eficial effects of therapeutic interventions, physiologic homeo-
static maintenance and prolonged support provided by cross-
circulation with a living host.
The present study has several limitations: (1) While the use of
inbred swine enabled recovery and regeneration of injured lungs
with minimal donor–recipient immunologic cross-reactivity,
future studies will need to assess the effects of immunosuppres-
sion (necessary for lung transplantation) on lung recovery. (2)
This study assessed recovery from lung injury 6 h after gastric
aspiration, a period within which a severe inflammatory response
develops. Clinically, aspiration events often precede interven-
tional recovery by more than 6 h, and additional studies are
needed to extend this approach to lungs enduring a longer
exposure to aspiration pneumonitis. Nevertheless, the injury
model and therapeutic regimen used in this study may also
represent an opportunity to inform clinical practice in cases of
known or suspected gastric aspiration (e.g., in trauma patients,
patients found down prior to admission to the hospital, or
patients intubated in the field by first responders). (3) To main-
tain appropriate controls, only a single lung was injured in each
experiment, while in the clinical setting, patients frequently
develop bilateral aspiration pneumonitis. (4) According to mul-
tiple assessment criteria, including radiography, pressure–volume
loops, compliance, histologic analyses, lung injury scores, and
cell-specific functional markers such as aquaporin 5 and surfac-
tant protein C, injured lungs improved to reach transplantation
criteria, but did not achieve full recovery. Future studies should
investigate the functional capacity of lungs following transplan-
tation, and if longer support and recovery times would be of
greater benefit.
Beyond demonstrating extracorporeal regeneration of severely
damaged lungs, this study resulted in the development of
technical
methodologies.
During
ex
vivo
organ
perfusion,
advanced thermography59 can be used for the identification of
flow and circuit failures60, and enable real-time visualization of
rewarming during lung reperfusion24. We extended thermo-
graphy to assessing global surface temperatures and conducting
localized thermal recovery tests as a diagnostic for non-invasive
evaluations of injured extracorporeal lungs. We also found that
exosome concentrations in BAL fluids from injured lungs were
elevated and increased over the first 12 h of cross-circulation. As
injured lungs recovered, exosome concentrations decreased and
approached levels in control lungs (Fig. 3g). Profiling of exosome
surface markers and cargo was beyond the scope of this study but
represents an opportunity for future investigation, as exosomes in
BAL fluid may represent a biomarker to diagnose, grade, and
monitor the trajectory of lung injury and recovery.
Envisioned clinical applications of an interventional cross-
circulation platform are motivated by the thousands of patients
who die every year awaiting suitable organs for transplantation.
The recovery of an unsuitable organ may represent their only
chance for transplantation and survival. We envision that pro-
longed extracorporeal support by interventional cross-circulation
could be used to recover and regenerate severely damaged organs
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Furthermore, as humanized swine and
immunosuppressive regimens are being developed for applica-
tions in xenotransplantation, the utility of a non-human host
should also be assessed in a xenogeneic cross-circulation system
for the recovery of human donor organs unacceptable for
transplantation.
In summary, we report: (i) the development of an interven-
tional extracorporeal organ support platform capable of systemic
regulation, (ii) the use of non-invasive diagnostics (dynamic
surface thermography, exosomes), and (iii) evidence of cellular
regeneration of severely damaged extracorporeal lungs. Further-
more, we demonstrate: longitudinal expression and regeneration
of cell markers of the pulmonary epithelium and endothelium,
recovery of functional subcellular structures, and cellular function
and integrity throughout 36 h of interventional cross-circulation.
Our results also establish a benchmark for molecular and cellular
analytics of extracorporeal lung regeneration (Supplementary
Table 4). We envision that interventional cross-circulation may
be used to investigate regeneration of other damaged organs (e.g.,
hearts, kidneys, livers), where expansion of donor pools through
the salvage of severely damaged organs could lead to more organ
transplantations.
Methods
Animals. Sixteen miniature swine (eight donor–recipient pairs) from a herd of
partially inbred swine were utilized in this study. Pairs with well-defined major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci were selected. Immunogenetic character-
istics and selective breeding methods have been previously reported61. Animals
were 5–8 months of age, with a median weight of 39.2 kg (range: 30.6–53.5 kg). All
studies complied with the relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and
research. Approval for this study was received from the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at Columbia University. Animal care and procedures were
conducted in accordance with the US National Research Council of the National
Academies Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition.
Standardization of gastric contents for gastric aspiration injury model. Gastric
contents were collected from six swine (of the same herd) deprived of food for 12 h
and standardized according to methods previously described21,25,36. Briefly, ani-
mals (n = 6) were sedated, and an orogastric tube (36 Fr) was inserted and engaged
to suction. Gastric contents collected from swine were admixed, strained through
sterile surgical gauze to remove large particulates, normalized with sterile hydro-
chloric acid to a standard pH of 2.00 ± 0.05, aliquotted, stored at – 80 °C, and
thawed immediately prior to experimental use (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The
concentration of total non-sulfated bile acids (416 ± 208 µM) and presence of
pepsin in standardized gastric contents were measured and confirmed using a Bile
Acid Assay Kit (Sigma–Aldrich) Pepsin ELISA kit (LSBio) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Microbial cultures of gastric contents were negative
for all aliquots.

 In vivo lung injury. Donor swine (n = 8) underwent general anesthesia via intra-
muscular induction with Telazol (5 mg kg−1, Zoetis) and buprenorphine hydro-
chloride (0.03 mg kg−1, Hospira). Following induction and intubation, the anesthetic
regimen consisted of continuous infusions of midazolam (1.5 mg kg−1 h−1, Akorn),
fentanyl citrate (0.1 mg kg−1 h−1, West-Ward), and inhaled isoflurane (1–5% in
oxygen, Henry Schein). Gastric aspiration injury was adapted from previously
established injury models21,25,36. Following donor sedation, a bronchoscope was
introduced into the lower lobe of a single lung, and the location of the bronchoscope
tip was confirmed by chest X-ray. Standardized gastric contents (2 mL kg−1; pH 2)
were delivered bronchoscopically while withdrawing the tip of the bronchoscope to a
position approximately 1 cm distal to the carina to avoid introduction of gastric
contents into the contralateral (control) lung. This distance was established prior to
delivery of standardized gastric contents by measuring the length of the bronchoscope
as it was advanced past the carina. After delivery, animals remained under general
anesthesia and standardized gastric contents remained in donor lungs for 6 h to allow
development of a unilateral acute lung injury in vivo.
Validation of gastric aspiration injury. Following unilateral bronchoscopic
delivery of standardized gastric contents into donor lungs, donor vitals and ven-
tilator settings were continuously recorded. Chest X-rays, airway bronchoscopic
images, and hemogases were obtained at baseline and every 2 h for 6 h. Donor
blood samples were collected at baseline and 6 h after gastric aspiration to assess
serum levels of inflammatory markers (GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1rα, IL-2,
IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, P-Selectin, and TNFα) by multiplex array
analysis (Eve Technologies) and hemolytic markers (D-dimer, fibrinogen, and
plasma free hemoglobin) by commercially available enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbant assays (ELISAs). A list of the ELISA kits used is provided in Supplementary
Table 11. BAL fluid samples were collected from injured and control lungs at
baseline and 6 h after gastric aspiration to assess the airway response to gastric
aspiration. Inflammatory markers (GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1rα, IL-2, IL-4
IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and TNFα) in BAL fluid samples were quantified by
multiplex array analysis (Eve Technologies), M30 by commercially available ELISA,
and cellular contents in BAL fluid were analyzed by Kwik-Diff staining or periodic
acid-Schiff staining. Gross images of injured lungs were obtained prior to explant
using an interchangeable lens digital camera (Sony).
Histopathologic analyses of in vivo lung injury. Tissue samples were collected
from lung segments (lower lobes and posterior segments of upper lobes) of injured
and control lungs according to a pre-determined lung map (Supplementary Fig. 4a)
to avoid sampling bias and enable randomized sampling of injured and control
lungs. A surgical stapler with medium/thick reloads was used to obtain lung
samples. Specimens were immediately fixed in cold phosphate-buffered 4% par-
aformaldehyde for 48–72 h, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3 μm or 5 μm
thickness. All sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and pen-
tachrome and examined via light microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining was
conducted for neutrophil elastase (airway and alveolar polymorphonuclear cells)
and caspase 3 (early apoptotic cells). Late apoptosis was detected on tissue sections
using a TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay. Pathologic review
was performed by a pulmonary pathologist blinded to the samples and study
protocol. All slides (H&E, immunohistochemical staining for neutrophil elastase
and caspase 3, and TUNEL) were randomized, arbitrarily numbered, and
delivered to the pathologist without reference to experimental time points or
conditions55. To evaluate gastric aspiration injury, a modified lung injury score was
developed from previously described methods56,57. Scoring (Supplementary
Table 6) was based on airway polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (hpf)
(×40; 0.2 mm2; 0 ⇒ 0, 1 ⇒ 1–25, 2 ⇒ 26–50, 3 ⇒ > 50), alveolar polymorpho-
nuclear cells per hpf (×40; 0.2 mm2; 0 ⇒ 0, 1 ⇒ 1–25, 2 ⇒ 26–50, 3 ⇒>50), alveolar
edema (0 ⇒<5% of all alveoli contained edema fluid, 1 ⇒ 6–25%, 2 ⇒ 26–50%,
3 ⇒>50%), interstitial infiltrate (lymphocytes and neutrophils in the interstitium
around vessels and airways and in alveolar septa and pleura; 0 ⇒ none per hpf,
1 ⇒ < 50 per hpf, 2 ⇒ 50–100 per hpf, 3 ⇒ > 100 per hpf), interstitial edema
(perivascular and peribronchial spaced expanded with edematous fluid; 0 ⇒ none
per hpf, 1 ⇒ 1x width vessel media, 2 ⇒ ≥ 2x width vessel media), and total number
of apoptotic cells per hpf (×40; 0.2 mm2; 0 ⇒ < 2, 1 ⇒ 3–5, 2 ⇒ 6–10, 3 ⇒>10).
Numbers for early and late apoptosis, as quantified by caspase 3 and TUNEL, were
combined into a single apoptosis score. Lung injury scores of injured and control
lungs were compared at 6 h after gastric aspiration as an index of lung injury
following unilateral delivery of standardized gastric contents.
Procurement of injured lungs. Prior to skin incision, animals were prepped and
draped in standard sterile fashion and antibiotics were given (Cefazolin, 30 mg kg−1;
WG Critical Care). Following median sternotomy, a heparin bolus (30,000 U) was
administered intravenously (Sagent Pharmaceuticals), and the main pulmonary artery
(PA) was cannulated. Autologous blood was collected via the PA cannula. Blood was
stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose collection bags (Chinook Medical) at 8 °C. Fol-
lowing exsanguination and presence of a non-perfusing cardiac rhythm, a
cold anterograde low-potassium dextran flush (Perfadex, Vitrolife) with alprostadil
(25 mg kg−1, Prostin VR Pediatric, Pfizer) was delivered via the main PA cannula,
and the inferior vena cava and left atrial appendage were transected. Concurrently
with the flush, topical cooling with sterile ice was applied. Once the flush was
complete additional dissection was completed, and the lungs were inflated to a sus-
tained airway pressure of 15 cmH2O. With the lungs inflated and all lobes recruited,
the trachea was stapled (Endo GIA, Medtronic), and the heart and lungs were
explanted en-bloc. Working on a sterile back table, the heart was removed. Cannu-
lation with the bio-bridge was facilitated by leaving a circumferential cuff (height of
3–5 mm) of the left atrium. Next, a retrograde flush with cold Perfadex (20 mL kg−1)
was performed. To prepare the bio-bridge, the aortic arch was first dissected, and the
left subclavian and brachiocephalic branches were stapled. A sufficient length of aorta
was left on either side of these vessels to facilitate placement of the pulmonary
vein cannula into one end and attachment to the left atrial cuff at the other (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2a–f).
Lung cannulation. To enable inflow via the pulmonary artery, an 18–20 Fr cannula
was secured using a purse-string 5–0 prolene suture, 0 silk ties, and TourniKwik
tourniquet (Medtronic). To enable ventilation, a 7.5–8.0 mm cuffed endotracheal
tube (Sheridan) was placed within the trachea and secured with 0 silk ties.
Single lung venous cannulation. The aortic arch, serving as an endothelialized
biological bridge (bio-bridge) between the lung and the extracorporeal circuit, was
connected to the left atrial cuff with a running 6–0 prolene suture (Ethicon).
Outflow through the bio-bridge was facilitated by the placement of a 36 Fr cre-
nellated drainage cannula. This venous drainage cannula was secured in place with
2–0 Ti-Cron ties (Covidien) or 0 silk ties. To assess unilateral gas exchange
function of injured or control lungs, two 20 G × 12 cm cannulas (Arrow Interna-
tional) (Supplementary Fig. 2e) were placed through the wall of the bio-bridge
(aortic arch) and inserted into the left and right pulmonary veins. The position of
each single lung venous cannula was confirmed by X-ray (Fig. 1d; Supplementary
Fig. 2g). Intravenous tubing (diameter: 3 mm) was connected to each single lung
venous cannula, led out of the organ preservation chamber, and connected to a
venous blood port (Supplementary Fig. 2h) to enable single lung venous blood
hemogas analysis.
Once cannulated, lungs were flushed with cold normal saline to remove air and
prime the cannulas. Within the preservation chamber (XVIVO), a top-loading
balance (Denver Instrument Company) was placed, followed by a double-lined
organ basin with warm recirculating saline (Supplementary Fig. 3). Lungs were
positioned in the prone position within the basin, and the PA, PV, and
endotracheal tube were secured. Whole blood collected during donor lung
procurement was used to prime the circuit. Next, the circuit was de-aired, and
connected to extracorporeal lungs. Initial flow rates were set to 5–10% of the
estimated cardiac output, with a target pulmonary artery pressure of <15 mmHg,
and pulmonary vein pressure of 3–5 mmHg.
Cross-circulation. Recipient swine (n = 8) underwent sedation and general anes-
thesia in the same fashion as donor swine. All recipients underwent endotracheal
intubation and were continuously ventilated throughout the duration of the study.
Prior to skin incision, antibiotics (Cefazolin; 30 mg kg−1) was given and re-dosed
every 8 h. An auricular arterial line (Arrow International) was placed for hemo-
dynamic monitoring and periodic blood sampling. Femoral arterial lines were used
if auricular placement was unsuccessful. Exposure of the left and right internal
jugular veins was accomplished via bilateral neck cut-downs. Cannulation with
16–18 Fr catheters was performed in standard fashion using the Seldinger tech-
nique. A heparin bolus (15,000 U) was administered just prior to cannulation.
Immediately prior to initiation of cross-circulation, 1 g methylprednisolone (APP
Pharmaceuticals) and 500 mg calcium chloride (Hospira) were intravenously
administered to recipient swine. Donor blood was used to prime the circuit, and
tubing was spliced to connect the recipient swine to the extracorporeal circuit,
marking the start of cross-circulation (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).
Ventilation was initiated within the first 10 min of cross-circulation while the
circuit and lungs were allowed to acclimate to ambient temperature. Initial settings
were as follows: volume control mode, respiratory rate 6–8 bpm, tidal volume (TV)
6–8 mL kg−1, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 40%
(Oxylog 3000 plus; Dräger). To recruit atelectatic lung regions, ventilatory
maneuvers included increasing PEEP (up to 10 cmH2O), TV, and by performing
inspiratory hold maneuvers (up to 25 cmH2O). Manual recruitment maneuvers
were used if ventilation strategies failed. Thermal images of the lung were captured
at periodic time points throughout the duration of each procedure using a FLIR
T430sc infrared camera.
Circuit elements consisted of the following: main console (Jostra HL-20 pump
console; Maquet), disposable pump (Rotaflow centrifugal pump; Maquet), softshell
reservoir (Maquet), and three-eighths inch tubing (Smart coated tubing;
LivaNova). Continuous monitoring and recording (VIPER clinical interfacing
software; G2 v1.26.4; Spectrum Medical) of pressures (pulmonary artery and vein),
flows (pulmonary artery and vein), and temperatures were performed. The
recipient was maintained on a continuous heparin infusion throughout the
duration of cross-circulation (initial rate of 25 U kg−1 h−1), and activated clotting
time (ACT) was measured using a whole blood micro-coagulation system
(Hemochron; Accriva Diagnostics). Adjustments to the heparin drip were made in
order to maintain a target ACT value of 250–350 s. Physiological parameters of the

 recipient were continuously monitored and recorded using a multi-parameter
Advisor vital signs monitor (SurgiVet). These included: heart rate,
electrocardiogram, blood pressure (cuff and arterial line pressure), mean arterial
pressure (MAP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), end-tidal CO2, temperature, and
respiratory rate. Analysis of recipient vitals, hemogas, biochemistry, hemolysis,
electrolytes, and serum cytokines throughout 36 h of cross-circulation is provided
in Supplementary Table 7, 8.
Therapeutic interventions. Recovery of injured lung function during cross-
circulation was facilitated by a series of interventions within the scope of standard
clinical practice. A standardized 30-min interventional procedure (Fig. 1b) was
performed on injured lungs at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 h of cross-circulation: three
cycles of bronchoalveolar lavage (15 min), surfactant replacement (5 min), and
alveolar recruitment (10 min), followed by functional assessments of injured and
control lungs by single lung analysis of hemogases and dynamic compliance. All
airway bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and surfactant delivery were per-
formed with a 3.8 mm flexible bronchoscope (aScope 3, Ambu).
Bronchoalveolar lavage. At 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 h of cross-circulation, bronch-
oalveolar lavage was used to clear gastric contents, secretions, and cellular debris
from injured lungs. Sterile normal saline (5 mL segment−1) was bronchoscopically
injected into each injured lung segment and immediately aspirated. To ther-
apeutically intervene in an injured porcine lung (e.g., the left porcine lung consists
of two lobes (cranial and caudal) with a total of ten bronchopulmonary seg-
ments62) the volume of lavage fluid per therapeutic intervention was ~50 mL. Five-
minute intervals were interspersed throughout the lavage procedure to minimize
interruptions in lung ventilation. Accordingly, similar to previously described
protocols11, the total volume of lavage fluid was ~300 mL.
Surfactant replacement. Immediately following bronchoalveolar lavage of injured
lungs at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 h of cross-circulation, exogenous surfactant (bovine
lipid extract surfactant, BLES; Biochemicals) was delivered bronchoscopically into
injured lungs. Bovine lipid extract surfactant was stored at –20 °C and warmed to
room temperature immediately prior to administration (Supplementary Fig. 8g).
During each therapeutic intervention, one vial of bovine lipid extract surfactant
(3 mL; 27 mg phospholipids mL−1) was administered and dispersed throughout
injured lungs. Accordingly, injured lungs received a total dose of bovine lipid
extract surfactant of 12.5 mg phospholipid kg−1 (donor swine body weight),
consistent with surfactant replacement strategies previously described11.
Alveolar recruitment. Following bronchoalveolar lavage and surfactant replace-
ment, alveolar recruitment maneuvers were performed to transiently increase the
airway positive pressure gradient, resulting in the opening of non-aerating lung
units and increased vital capacity, while avoiding barotrauma and the deleterious
effects of hyperinflation. Ventilation strategies included increasing tidal volume by
15–20%, increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) up to 12.5 cmH2O,
and performing inspiratory hold maneuvers (sustained inflation) up to 25 cmH2O.
When ventilation strategies were insufficient, manual recruitment maneuvers were
performed by an experienced lung transplant surgeon in a manner consistent with
standard practices used during clinical lung transplantation. During inspiration,
gentle manual compression was applied to areas of aerated lung, thereby directing
ventilation and recruitment toward areas of non-aerating atelectatic lung. Peak
inspiratory pressures were monitored and maintained below 30 cmH2O. Accord-
ingly, during each therapeutic intervention, injured lungs were subjected to 10 min
of alveolar recruitment maneuvers prior to returning all ventilator settings to a lung
protective ventilation strategy. Injured lungs underwent a total alveolar recruitment
time of ~60 min.
Recipient monitoring and blood analysis. Hourly blood samples were drawn
from an auricular arterial line (or femoral arterial line if auricular placement was
unsuccessful), and analyzed using an epoc point-of-care blood analysis system
(Epocal). Additional samples were collected in test-specific specimen vials (BD
Vacutainer) every 4 h to obtain the following: complete blood count, liver function
tests, basic metabolic panel, lactate dehydrogenase, and coagulation panels (Antech
Diagnostics). Additional hemolytic markers (D-dimer, plasma free hemoglobin
fibrinogen,) and inflammatory markers (GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1rα, IL-2,
IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, P-selectin, and TNF-α) were analyzed in
triplicate by the Discovery Assay Pig Cytokine Array (Eve Technologies) or by
commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. A list of the ELISA kits used is provided in
Supplementary Table 11.
Extracorporeal lung monitoring and functional analyses. Blood samples were
drawn from the main pulmonary artery cannula (blood entering both lungs), main
pulmonary vein cannula (blood exiting both lungs), and single lung venous can-
nulas (blood exiting each lung) every 6 h and analyzed in the same fashion as
recipient blood samples. Temporary changes in ventilation settings (minute ven-
tilation and FiO2) were made according to a lung performance challenge protocol
in order to further assess extracorporeal lung performance every 6 h. Immediately
following the challenge, a subsequent set of blood samples were drawn from the
pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein cannulas. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn = TV/
(PIP – PEEP); mL cmH2O−1) of extracorporeal lungs was calculated every 6 h.
Pressure and volume recordings of lungs were measured using a custom mea-
surement system consisting of sensors for pressure and airflow and a data acqui-
sition device (Arduino Uno). Data collected with this system were processed, and
pressure–volume loops were generated using MATLAB v. R2016b (Mathworks).
Lung weight was obtained every 6 h using the top-loading scale (Denver Instru-
ment Company) within the organ chamber. To ensure accurate recordings, the
basin and contents were tared (zeroed) at each time point. X-ray images of lungs
were obtained using a PXP-16HF portable X-ray unit (United Radiology Systems)
at 2.2 mAs and 90 kVp.
Single lung ventilation. To enable single lung ventilation and single lung com-
pliance measurements, an endobronchial blocker (7 Fr; Cook Medical) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2i–k) was inserted into the left or right main stem bronchus under
video bronchoscopy (Fig. 1h; Supplementary Fig. 2l). The balloon was then
expanded in the main stem bronchus to occlude airflow (Supplementary Fig. 2m)
and enable single lung ventilation of the contralateral lung. Additionally, when
obtaining measurements from the left lung the endotracheal tube was advanced
slightly and the cuff was inflated to enable the occlusion of the right tracheal
bronchus (i.e., pig bronchus). Once occluded, tidal volumes were reduced by half
and pressure–volume loops and dynamic compliance of single lungs (injured or
control) were acquired during single lung ventilation.
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis. BAL fluid samples were collected by
wedging a 3.8 mm flexible bronchoscope (aScope 3, Ambu) into a subsegmental
bronchus of an injured or control lung. Sterile normal saline (5 mL) was injected,
aspirated, and collected in a sterile specimen trap (Busse Hospital Disposables).
Gross images of BAL fluid samples were acquired throughout 36 h of cross-
circulation using an interchangeable lens digital camera (Sony). The pH of BAL
fluid samples was measured with a glass double junction microelectrode (Fisher
Scientific). BAL fluid samples were centrifuged at 2164 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Snap-
frozen supernatants were stored at –80 °C until further processing.
Cytopathology. The cellular contents of BAL fluid samples were visualized by
Kwik-Diff staining or periodic acid-Schiff staining of BAL fluid smears and
quantified using a previously described automatic cell counting algorithm
(ImageJ)63 (Supplementary Fig. 4b).
Molecular pathology. Inflammatory markers (GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-
1rα, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, M30, and TNFα) in BAL fluid
samples collected from injured and control lungs were analyzed in triplicate using
either the Eve Technologies Discovery Assay Pig Cytokine Array or commercially
available enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) (Supplementary Table 9).
Total protein concentrations of BAL fluid samples were determined using a protein
assay (Pierce Coomassie Bradford Protein Assay Kit, ThermoFisher Scientific) with
bovine serum albumin as a standard. Pepsin concentrations in BAL fluid samples
were measured using a commercially available porcine pepsin ELISA kit (LS Bio)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Microbial cultures. BAL fluid samples collected from injured and control lungs
throughout 36 h of interventional cross-circulation were submitted to a diagnostic
laboratory (Antech Diagnostics; Lake Success, NY) for bacterial cultures. Microbial
cultures of BAL fluid samples collected from injured lungs (n = 8) and control
lungs (n = 8) were negative for pathologic growth after 72 h in all cases. Of note, all
contents within the organ chamber were sterile, and proper sterile technique was
stringently adhered to during all tissue sampling and lung manipulation. Between
each use the bronchoscope was disinfected and sterilized according to established
protocols to prevent bronchoscopy-associated infection64.
Exosomes. BAL fluid samples collected from injured and control lungs throughout
36 h of interventional cross-circulation were submitted for analysis of exosome
total concentration, concentration as a function of size, distribution of mean
particle size (diameter), and imaging (Supplementary Movie 8) (NanoSight
Tracking Analysis, System Biosciences).
Acetylated LDL uptake assay. To assess the function and viability of the vascular
endothelium65, at the conclusion of each procedure, biopsies of the pulmonary
arteries and veins were collected and placed in a 96-well plate (BD Falcon).
Acetylated LDL, Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (ThermoScientific L35353) was diluted
1:200 in 1X DMEM/F12K (50/50) cell culture media (Corning). Wells received
150 μL of media containing acetylated LDL. Media alone (150 μL) was added to
control wells containing vascular biopsies from each source. The multi-well plate
was then covered and incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 4 h. Next, samples
were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixation in cold
phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h. Samples were then embedded

 in paraffin, sectioned (5-μm thickness), de-paraffinization, stained with DAPI, and
examined using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus FSX100).
Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester uptake assay. To assess the viability of
the pulmonary endothelium, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Affy-
metrix, eBioscience) was reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of
1.06 M and protected from light. At the conclusion of each procedure, CFSE was
delivered via intravascular injection with a 20 Ga needle. Following 15 min incu-
bation, samples were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in
cold phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, fixed, embedded, de-
paraffinized, and imaged using an Olympus FSX100 microscope.
BODIPY-surfactant uptake assay. To assess the functional uptake and viability of
type II pneumocytes66, delivery of a fluorescent BODIPY-labeled surfactant protein
B (BODIPY-SPB) was performed into the distal regions of injured lungs. A flexible
video bronchoscope and Renegade microcatheter system (Boston Scientific)
enabled targeted delivery. Lung samples were collected after 30 min using a surgical
stapler (Medtronic). Samples were then dissected, rinsed (Dulbecco’s phosphate-
buffered saline), and imaged immediately with an Olympus FSX100 microscope.
Further resolution was obtained by incubating injured lung tissue samples (2 × 2
mm) collected after 36 h of cross-circulation with 20 ng mL−1 BODIPY-SPB for
30 min in a normoxic incubator at 37 °C. Next, specimens underwent staining for
10 min with CellMask Deep Red plasma-membrane stain, followed by five wash-
ings for 1 min each (Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline). Images were acquired
with a two-photon confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8). Visuali-
zation of the fluorescent signal in a punctate pattern (lamellar bodies) within type
II pneumocytes indicated surfactant uptake.
Metabolic activity assay. To assess changes in lung metabolism, lung tissue
samples from injured and control lungs were collected at 0 and 36 h of cross-
circulation. Lung parenchyma (~250 μL tissue volume; n = 8) was dissected in
standard sterile fashion. Fine mincing and gentle homogenization was performed
prior to sample placement in a 96-well plate. Alamar Blue Assay67 (ThermoFisher)
reagent was diluted 1:10 in DMEM cell culture media with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Next, 100 μL Alamar Blue reagent was added to wells containing lung sample
homogenates. In addition, Alamar Blue alone (100 μL) was added to empty wells
(negative controls). The multi-well plate was covered and incubated at 37 °C with
gentle shaking for 2 h. Following incubation, well contents were transferred into
new 96-well plates, and absorbance (optical density, OD) was measured at 570 nm
and normalized to absorbance at 600 nm. Following the metabolic activity assay,
the DNA content of each sample was quantified using a Quanti-iT PicoGreen
dsDNA Assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sample digestion was carried out in 250 µg papain mL−1 at 60 °C for 4 h and mixed
with PicoGreen reagent. To quantify DNA using a standard curve, fluorescence
emission was measured at 520 nm with excitation at 480 nm.
Myeloperoxidase activity assay. To study the activity of myeloperoxidase
(MPO), tissue samples were collected at multiple time points throughout cross-
circulation. Lung tissue sections (≥10 mg) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at –80 °C. MPO assay was conducted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Abcam, ab111749).
Thermography. Thermal images of the lungs were captured at selected time points
throughout the cross-circulation procedure using a T430sc infrared camera (FLIR)
and ResearchIR v. 4.40.6 software (FLIR). Lung surface temperatures were averaged
over isomorphic regions of interest in injured and control lungs and plotted relative
to the average blood temperature during cross-circulation.
Hypothermic probe test. To standardize background reflectance and atmospheric
effects68 prior to each hypothermic probe test, the lung was maintained for a
minimum of 10 min enclosed within the organ chamber to allow lung surface
temperatures to equilibrate to ambient conditions. For each hypothermic probe
test, real-time calibrated thermal videos of the hypothermic probe test were
recorded at 60 frames s−1. The organ chamber was opened, and a hypothermic
probe (aluminum alloy tip, diameter: 8 mm) maintained at 4 °C was immediately
and consistently brought into physical contact with the pleural surface of injured or
control lungs at pre-determined, designated locations for a duration of 1 s. Contact
pressures were calibrated and then standardized across all tests and time points
using a manual push–pull force gauge (Topac). Thermal videography of lung
regions topically cooled by thermophysical contact with the hypothermic probe
was acquired for non-invasive quantitative assessment of localized rewarming in
injured and control lungs (Supplementary Movie 7). Thermographic images were
extracted from raw video sequences at 15 s intervals. Differences in surface tem-
peratures between topically cooled regions and surrounding surface areas were
quantified throughout 36 h of cross-circulation using video thermography and
image analysis software (ImageJ 1.51m9). Extracted images were subjected to image
processing wherein average pixel values were measured in congruent regions of
topically cooled areas and areas unaffected by hypothermic cooling. Differences in
mean pixel values were calculated and plotted as a function of time.
Immunohistochemical staining. Following de-paraffinization, lung sections were
subjected to boiling citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, and blocked with
10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature.
Next, primary antibodies were diluted 1:100, applied, and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C
or 4 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:200 and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were mounted in Vectashield Mounting
Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and coverslips were applied. Images
were obtained using an Olympus FSX100 microscope. To detect late apoptosis, a
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick
end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was used. Immunohistochemical stains for aquaporin
5 (Abcam, ab78486), caspase 3 (Abcam, ab13847), CD163 (Abcam, ab87099),
CD31 (Abcam, ab28364), connexin 43 (Abcam, ab11370), neutrophil elastase
(Abcam, ab68672), surfactant protein C (Abcam, ab196677), zonula occludens-1
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-10804), and zonula occludens-3 (Abcam, ab205882)
were conducted by the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center molecular
pathology services at Columbia University Medical Center. A list of antibodies and
dilutions used is provided in Supplementary Table 10.
Histopathologic sample collection and analysis. The location of each lung wedge
sample was randomized for each time point prior to the start of the experiment.
Each lung was divided into 12 regions as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4a. To avoid
sampling bias, a random number generator (www.random.org) was used to assign
a lung region to each sample collection time point. Tissue sampling was restricted
to the lower half of injured and control lungs to eliminate sampling bias in superior
segments of upper lobes of injured lungs with better aeration. A surgical stapler
with medium/thick reloads was used to obtain lung samples every 6 h. Specimens
were immediately fixed in cold phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for
48–72 h, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3 μm or 5 μm thickness. All sec-
tions were stained for hematoxylin and eosin and examined under light micro-
scopy. Additional sections were stained for Alcian blue (pH 2), trichrome, silver
reticulin, elastic van Gieson, and pentachrome by histology services in the
Department of Molecular Pathology at Columbia University Medical Center.
Blinded pathologic review. Blinded pathologic review was performed by a pul-
monary pathologist blinded to the study protocol. All slides (H&E, immunohis-
tochemical staining for neutrophil elastase and caspase 3, and TUNEL;
Supplementary Fig. 6 a, b; Supplementary Fig. 7f) were randomized, arbitrarily
numbered, and delivered to the pathologist without reference to experimental time
points or conditions55. To evaluate recovery from injury resulting from aspiration
of gastric contents, a modified lung injury score was developed from previously
described methods56,57. Scoring (Supplementary Table 6) was based on number of
airway polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (hpf) (×40; 0.2 mm2; 0 ⇒ 0,
1 ⇒ 1–25, 2 ⇒ 26–50, 3 ⇒ >50), number of alveolar polymorphonuclear cells per
hpf (×40; 0.2 mm2; 0 ⇒ 0, 1 ⇒ 1–25, 2 ⇒ 26–50, 3 ⇒ >50), alveolar edema (0 ⇒
<5% of all alveoli contained edema fluid, 1 ⇒ 6–25%, 2 ⇒ 26–50%, 3 ⇒ >50%),
interstitial infiltrate (number of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the interstitium
around vessels and airways and in alveolar septa and pleura; 0 ⇒ 0 per hpf, 1 ⇒ <50
per hpf, 2 ⇒ 50–100 per hpf, 3 ⇒ >100 per hpf), interstitial edema (perivascular
and peribronchial spaces expanded with edematous fluid; 0 ⇒ 0 per hpf, 1 ⇒ 1x
width vessel media, 2 ⇒ ≥2x width vessel media), and total number of apoptotic
cells per hpf (×40; 0.2 mm2; 0 ⇒ <2, 1 ⇒ 3–5, 2 ⇒ 6–10, 3 ⇒ >10). Numbers for
early and late apoptosis, as quantified by caspase 3 and TUNEL, respectively, were
combined into a single apoptosis score. Lung injury scores of injured and control
lungs were compared at 6 h after gastric aspiration and periodically throughout
interventional cross-circulation procedures as an index of lung injury following
unilateral delivery of standardized gastric contents.
Scanning electron microscopy. Lung samples were obtained from multiple time
points (0, 18, and 36 h of cross-circulation), and fixed in formalin for 48 h. Spe-
cimens were then rinsed in 70% ethanol, frozen, and lyophilized. Samples were
imaged using Zeiss GeminiSEM 300 with accelerating voltage of 2.5 kV.
Transmission electron microscopy. Lung samples were obtained from multiple
time points (0, 18, and 36 h of cross-circulation), and fixed with 2.5% glutar-
aldehyde in 0.1 M Sorensen’s buffer (pH 7.2). Next, lung samples were post-fixed
with 1% OsO4 in Sorenson’s buffer for 1 h, and following dehydration, tissues were
embedded in Lx-112 (Ladd Research Industries). Sectioning was performed on a
PT-XL ultramicrotome (60 nm thickness). Samples were then stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a JEOL JEM-1200 EXII electron
microscope. Images capture was performed using an ORCA-HR digital camera
(Hamamatsu) and recorded with AMT Image Capture Engine v.602.569.
Statistical analysis. No data were excluded from analysis. One-way analysis of
variance with Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc tests and Student’s t-tests were

 performed using Prism Version 7.0e (GraphPad). A value of p < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Study design. The study was designed as a proof-of-concept study (n = 8) for the
purposes of testing interventional procedures and demonstrating the ability to
support and recover the function of acutely injured lungs with cross-circulation for
36 h, during which standard therapeutic interventions could be performed and the
functional recovery of lungs assessed. Our hypothesis was that cross-circulation
could provide a sufficiently robust level of extracorporeal support to enable mul-
tiple therapeutic interventions and recovery of extracorporeal lung function. The
study was conducted with the minimum number of animals needed to demonstrate
reproducibility and achieve statistical significance between time points. Data from
this initial study will be used to conduct power analysis for subsequent investi-
gations. Collection of all samples was performed as technical replicates in triplicate.
Randomization of sampling. Samples of extracorporeal lung collected for histo-
logic, microscopic, and pathologic analyses were collected randomly during pro-
cedures according to a pre-determined lung map (Supplementary Fig. 4a) with 12
regions arbitrarily numbered for each lung.
Blinded review. All analytical assessments were blinded to the maximum practical
extent. Pathologic analysis was performed by an independent expert to
eliminate bias.
