P
latelets play a pivotal role in thromboembolic diseases and 
participate in early stages of the pathophysiological pro-
cess. Therefore, antiplatelet drugs have become a major class 
of therapeutics used to prevent and reverse platelet aggrega-
tion in acute coronary diseases, the leading cause of death in 
the world.1,2 Currently prescribed antiplatelet drugs, including 
cyclooxygenase inhibitors, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, ADP 
receptor antagonists, and glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor 
antagonists, have 1 common side effect—an increased risk 
of hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia.3,4 Thus, the ideal effi-
cacious antithrombotic agents with minimal bleeding side 
effect are under active investigation. Experimental and clini-
cal evidence has shown that platelets deficient in GPVI fail to 
activate/aggregate in response to collagen, but this deficiency 
in GPVI expression does not lead to severe bleeding.5,6 As 
a result, GPVI has emerged as a potential pharmacological 
target because the inhibition of this receptor seems to ideally 
exhibit antithrombotic efficacy with good safety.

Objective—Currently prescribed antiplatelet drugs have 1 common side effect—an increased risk of hemorrhage and 
thrombocytopenia. On the contrary, bleeding defects associated with glycoprotein VI (GPVI) expression deficiency are 
usually slightly prolonged bleeding times. However, GPVI antagonists are lacking in clinic.
Approach and Results—Using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing, we revealed the 
partial sequence of trowaglerix α subunit, a potent specific GPVI-targeting snaclec (snake venom C-type lectin protein). 
Hexapeptide (Troα6 [trowaglerix a chain hexapeptide, CKWMNV]) and decapeptide (Troα10) derived from trowaglerix 
specifically inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation through blocking platelet GPVI receptor. Computational peptide 
design helped to design a series of Troα6/Troα10 peptides. Protein docking studies on these decapeptides and GPVI suggest 
that Troα10 was bound at the lower surface of D1 domain and outer surface of D2 domain, which was at the different place 
of the collagen-binding site and the scFv (single-chain variable fragment) D2-binding site. The newly discovered site was 
confirmed by inhibitory effects of polyclonal antibodies on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. This indicates that D2 
domain of GPVI is a novel and important binding epitope on GPVI-mediated platelet aggregation. Troα6/Troα10 displayed 
prominent inhibitory effect of thrombus formation in fluorescein sodium-induced platelet thrombus formation of mesenteric 
venules and ferric chloride-induced carotid artery injury thrombosis model without prolonging the in vivo bleeding time.
Conclusions—We develop a novel antithrombotic peptides derived from trowaglerix that acts through GPVI antagonism with 
greater safety—no severe bleeding. The binding epitope of polypeptides on GPVI is novel and important. These hexa/
decapeptides have therapeutic potential for developing ideal small-mass GPVI antagonists for arterial thrombogenic diseases.

function.8,9 CVX (convulxin), a multimeric protein derived from 
Crotalus durissus terrificus venom, is the first identified sna-
clec capable of inducing platelet activation via binding to GPVI 
and GPIb.10,11 The structure of GPVI together with its ligand has 
been partially determined,12 casting some light on the potential 
binding sites at molecular level. Because GPVI ligand complex 
structure was not fully evaluated, the detailed GPVI-ligand-
binding domain and the dissection of critical sequence responsi-
ble for design of target inhibition still need further investigation.
Previous literature has shown that GPVI recognizes gly-
cine–proline–hydroxyproline repeat motifs in the triple heli-
cal structure of collagen.13 GPVI has 2 extracellular C2-type 
immunoglobulin-like domains (D1 and D2). The residues of 
GPVI extracellular domain, involved in the GPVI–collagen 
interaction, are majorly located on the surface of D1 
domain.14,15 It also was suggested that CVX exists in solution 
as a dimer of α4β4 rings and contains 8 distinct GPVI-binding 
sites and binds GPVI with high-binding affinities.16 Also, 
presence of 2 distinct GPVI-binding surfaces on the (α4β4)2 
CVX dimers allows CVX to both cluster GPVI on a single cell 
and to cross-link target cells via GPVI.
We previously demonstrated that Trowaglerix, a novel sna-
clec purified from Tropidolaemus wagleri venom, specifically 
activated platelets via GPVI when compared with CVX (mixed 
binding of GPVI and GPIb).17 Here, we determined the par-
tial amino acid sequences of trowaglerix and synthesized the 
small-mass peptides derived from these snaclecs C terminal 
accordingly. We found that the hexa-/decapeptides of trowa-
glerix α subunit specifically exhibited marked inhibitory activ-
ity on collagen-induced platelet aggregation by interacting with 
GPVI receptor in vitro and effectively exerted antithrombotic 
activity in mice model without causing bleeding tendency. 
Through computational peptide design and molecular dynamic 
simulations on the decapeptides and GPVI, the possible bind-
ing site was identified near D1/D2 domain surface, which is 
different from well-known collagen-binding site.

Results
Hexapeptide and Decapeptide Derived 
From Trowaglerix Specifically Inhibit 
Collagen-Induced Platelet Aggregation 
and Downstream Activation Cascade
Trowaglerix α subunit obtained from reverse-phase high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (Figure 1A) was more effective in 
inhibiting collagen-induced platelet aggregation compared with 
β subunit (Figure 1B). The sequences are similar to several other 
snaclecs with some distinctive differences observed (Figure 1C). 
Several hexapeptides from snaclecs of C terminus, including 
CVX (CVXα6/CVXβ6), trowaglerix (Troα6 [trowaglerix a 
chain hexapeptide, CKWMNV]), aggretin (also called rhodo-
cytin, a α2β1/CLEC-2 agonist, Aggα6/Aggβ6), and agkistin 
(a GPIb agonist, Agkα6/Agkβ6), were used to investigate their 
effects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. As shown in 
Figure 2A, trowaglerix hexapeptide (Troα6 100 μg/mL, 128.2 
μmol/L) showed the most potent inhibitory effect (almost 50% 
inhibition) on collagen-induced aggregation. Thus, Troα6 was 
selected for further mutation studies to investigate which amino 
acid is critical for its inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity 
of Troα6 was diminished by mutating the specific amino acid 
residue (W116A; Figure 2B), indicating that this tryptophan 
residue is critical for the expression of Troα6 inhibitory activity. 
Moreover, scrambled peptide(s) showed little effect.
As shown in Figure 2C, Troα6 specifically inhibited col-
lagen-induced platelet aggregation in platelet suspension and 
human platelet-rich plasma without affecting platelet aggrega-
tion stimulated by other agonists (ADP, thrombin, ristocetin, 
or gramicetin). Therefore, Troα6 was proposed to specifically 
interact with collagen receptors (integrin α2β1 or GPVI) to 
inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Decapeptides 
were further investigated by extending the original hexapeptides 
(decapeptide, Troα10, and GFCKWMNVAC) to evaluate their 
effects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Troα10 dis-
played more prominent inhibitory effect on collagen-induced 
platelet aggregation than Troα6 at the same concentration 
(100 μg/mL), with IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentra-
tion) of 30.42±9.52 and 106.90±11.09 μmol/L, respectively 
(Figure 2D). Troα6/Troα10 also displayed concentration-
dependently inhibitory effects on P-selectin expression, throm-
boxane A2 formation, and intracellular calcium concentration 
([Ca2+]i) increasing of collagen-stimulated platelets (Figure IA 
through IC in the online-only Data Supplement).
In addition, the inhibitory activity of Troα10 was dimin-
ished by the substitution of 5 amino acid residues, including 
a glycine residue (Gly, G), a phenylalanine (Phe, F) residue, 2 
sites of half-cystine (Cys, C), and a tryptophan (Trp, W) resi-
due (Figure 2E), indicating that these residues are essential for 
maintaining the activity of Troα10.
Troα6/Troα10 Binds To Platelet GPVI 
and Inhibits GPVI Signal Transduction 
in Platelets Activated by Collagen
We used flow cytometry to elucidate the binding site of Troα6/
Troα10 on human platelets. As shown in Figure 3A, FITC 
(fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated Troα10 concentra-
tion dependently bound to platelets and almost saturated 
at a concentration of 300 μg/mL (FITC-conjugated Troα6 
showed the similar effect in Figure ID in the online-only Data 
Supplement). To further confirm the GPVI-Troα10 interaction, 
an ELISA was performed. Biotin-conjugated Troα10 binds 
to recombinant GPVI in a concentration-dependent manner 
as shown in Figure 3B. It also reveals a high-affinity binding 
of Troα10 (apparent dissociation constant Kd=9.06±2.59 µg/
mL [7.82±2.24 μmol/L]). A major 60-kDa platelet membrane 
protein was specifically recognized by a GPVI mAb, 326E12 
(Figure 3C). Synthetic Troα10 was also tested for its inhibi-
tory effect on GPVI binding to collagen in ELISA experiment.

Troα10 showed essentially no inhibitory effect on GPVI binding 
to collagen even at high concentrations (Figure 3D), indicating 
that the binding epitope of Troα10 on GPVI may be different 
from those of 326E12 and collagen. Furthermore, to confirm 
GPVI as the major target for Troα10-mediated platelet–colla-
gen association, we also compared the concentration–inhibition 
curves by collagen and CVX (Figure 3E). Troα10 also has the 
ability to inhibit CVX-induced platelet aggregation in platelet 
suspension with similar inhibition pattern when compared to 
collagen. The binding of collagen to platelet GPVI receptor is 
known to trigger platelet aggregation through sequential tyro-
sine phosphorylation of signaling molecules.18 In the presence 
of decapeptide, collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 
these kinases (including Src, Fyn, LAT, and PLCγ2 [phospho-
lipase Cγ2]) and the subsequent platelet activation were sup-
pressed (Figure IE in the online-only Data Supplement).
The Possible GPVI Binding Sites of the 
Decamer Was Located at the Inner Surface 
Between the D1 and D2 Domains
To understand the potential binding sites of the trowaglerix pep-
tides at GPVI, exhaustive docking of the trowaglerix decamer 
peptide with the entire surface of GPVI was performed. First, 
the 3-dimensional structure of the decamer peptide from trow-
aglerix was predicted (Figure 4A). The residues from 3Cys to 
6Met formed an α helix, as other residues formed a linear-like 
structure. The decamer peptide was folded in a U-shaped form.
Unlike the entire C-type lectin-like snake venom proteins 
which contain GPVI-binding sites at the boundary between 
the α and β subunits of the proteins, the docking models 
showed that the binding site of trowaglerix α decamer was 
at the inner surface of the area between D1 and D2 domains 
of GPVI (Figure 4B). From the docked position, residues 12 
to 16 in D1 domain provided a cavity for fitting the lysine 4 
of the peptide. Also, cysteine 10 of the peptide might have 
hydrogen bond interaction with the main chain oxygen atoms 
of the residues glycine 129 and asparagine 136 in D2 domain. 
We further designed polyclonal antibodies, one targeting the 
outer surface at D2 domain (D2[A]), and the other targeting 
collagen-binding site at D1 domain (D1[B]), which are the 
predicted epitopes toward Troα10, to investigate their effects 
on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The D1 and D2 
targeting epitopes were KEGDPAPYKNPER (D2[A]) and 
QGPPGVDLYRLEK (D1[B]). As shown in Figure 4C, anti-
bodies against outer surface at D2 showed better inhibitory 
effects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation, compared 
with antibodies against collagen-binding site at D1 domain. 
Antibody against outer surface at D2 displayed more promi-
nent inhibitory effect than antibody against collagen-binding 
site at D1, indicating that the predicted binding epitope of 
Troα10 on GPVI D2 domain is a novel binding candidate for 
developing anti-GPVI agents.
Antithrombotic Activity of Troα6/Troα10 
in Ex Vivo and In Vivo Model
We next investigated the ex vivo antithrombotic effect of 
Troα6/Troα10 by examining the responsiveness of platelet-
rich plasma prepared from Troα6/Troα10-treated mice toward 
Figure 1. Fractionation of trowaglerix α 
or β subunits, their effects on collagen-
induced platelet aggregation, and 
sequence alignment of trowaglerix α

(snake venom C-type lectin protein). A, 
Fractionation of the reduced and alkyl-
ated trowaglerix on a reserve-phase high-
performance liquid chromatography was 
performed using a C8 column. Fraction 
of α and β subunits was eluted at 20 and 
22 min, respectively. B, Washed human 
platelets were preincubated with α and 
β subunits (5 μg/mL each) of trowaglerix 
at 37°C for 3 min, and then stimulated 
with collagen (2 μg/mL) to trigger plate-
let aggregation. Results are expressed 
as percentage of inhibition. Data are

sequences are shaded. Percentage iden-
tity between trowaglerix and other sna-
clecs proteins are shown at the bottom

collagen. Platelet aggregation response induced by collagen 
was significantly inhibited in platelet-rich plasma prepared 
from mice pretreated with Troα6 (30 mg/kg, % of inhibi-
tion: 57.07±6.06, n=22) or Troα10 (8 mg/kg, % of inhibition: 
85.27±7.78, n=10) for 5 minutes (Figure 5A). However, the 
platelet counts, as measured at 5 minutes after the administra-
tion of Troα6/Troα10, were not altered.
Furthermore, the in vivo antithrombotic effect of Troα6 
was examined by thrombus formation in irradiated mesenteric 
venules of mice pretreated with fluorescein sodium. As shown 
in Figure 5B, intravenous administration of Troα6 (30 mg/
kg) delayed thrombus formation and significantly prolonged 
the time to occlusion from 134.9±10.34 s (control, n=19) 
to 315.9±21.89 s (n=20). Initially, we chose Troα10 30 mg/
kg to perform in vivo study. However, we found that deca-
peptide exhibits more prominent inhibition than hexapeptide 
both in in vitro and ex vivo experiments (Figures 2D and 5A). 
Therefore, we used a lower dose of decapeptide to examine its 
effect. Troα10 (10 mg/kg) also markedly prolonged the occlu-
sion time to 294.5±25.38 s (n=19). On the other hand, at the

Troα6 (trowaglerix a chain hexapeptide, CKWMNV) and other synthetic hexapeptide, 100 μg/mL): convulxin α and β (CVXα6/CVXβ6), 
trowaglerix α (Troα6), aggretin α and β (Aggα6/Aggβ6), agkistin α and β (Agkα6/Agkβ6), at 37°C for 3 min. After incubation, platelets were 
stimulated with collagen (3 μg/mL) to trigger platelet aggregation. Results are expressed as percentage of inhibition. Data are presented 
as mean±SEM (n=3–4). B, Washed human platelets were preincubated with hexapeptide (Troα6), its mutants or scrambled hexapeptides 
(s, 100 μg/mL) at 37°C for 3 min, and then stimulated with collagen (3 μg/mL) to trigger platelet aggregation. Results are expressed as

(20 μmol/L) to trigger platelet aggregation. Washed human platelets (PS) were preincubated (upper arrowhead) with Troα6 (100 μg/mL) 
at 37°C for 3 min, and then stimulated (lower arrowhead) with collagen (3 μg/mL) or thrombin (0.05 U/mL) to trigger platelet aggregation, 
ristocetin (1 mg/mL) in the presence of small amount of plasma (10 μL) as the source of von Willebrand factor or gramicetin (1 μg/mL) to 
trigger platelet agglutination. This is representative of at least 3 similar results obtained from separate experiments. D, Washed human 
platelets were preincubated (upper arrowhead) with Troα6 or Troα10 at the same concentration (100 μg/mL) at 37°C for 3 min, and then

and its mutants (100 μg/mL) at 37°C for 3 min, and then stimulated with collagen (5 μg/mL) to trigger platelet aggregation. Results are 
expressed as percentage of inhibition. Data are presented as mean±SEM (n=3–4).

dose of 250 mg/kg, aspirin increased the occlusion time to 
298.7±29.55 s (n=15). In FeCl3-induced arterial thrombosis 
model, complete carotid artery occlusion occurred in control 
ICR (imprinting control region) mice in response to 5% FeCl3 
within 15 minutes, whereas Troα10 (8 mg/kg)-treated mice 
showed no appreciable changes in blood flow ≤60 minutes 
(Figure 5C). These data showed that intravenous administra-
tion of hexa-/decapeptide exhibited antithrombic activity both 
ex vivo and in vivo in mice.
The prolonged bleeding phenotype is the common unde-
sirable side effect after antithrombotic therapy. A mouse 
tail transection model was used to examine the influence 
of hexa-/decapeptide on hemostasis in vivo. As shown in 
Figure 5D, Troα6 (30 mg/kg) and Troα10 (8 mg/kg) did 
not apparently affect the bleeding time in mice (Troα6: 
3.09±0.70 minutes, Troα10: 2.01±0.26 minutes versus con-
trol 1.81±0.19 minutes, P>0.05). In contrast, tirofiban (0.4 
mg/kg, a commercial GPIIb/IIIa antagonist) and aspirin at 
the dose of 250 mg/kg significantly prolonged the bleeding 
times (6.31±0.95 minutes, P<0.01 and 8.20±0.91 minutes, 
P<0.001, respectively).
Discussion
In this study, we have identified the partial amino acid 
sequences of trowaglerix, a specific GPVI-binding snaclec α 
subunit.17 We have also predicted the structure of decapeptide 
and analyzed its possible binding sites at the inner surface of 
the area between D1 and D2 domains of GPVI, which is novel 
and probably different from well-known collagen-binding 
site. Most importantly, we found that the hexa-/decapeptide 
of trowaglerix α subunit (Troα6/Troα10) specifically exhib-
ited inhibitory activity toward collagen-induced aggregation 
via interacting with platelet GPVI receptor and displayed anti-
thrombotic effect in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to design small-mass peptides derived from snaclecs 
with antithrombotic activity that target platelet GPVI receptor 
with atypical binding epitope.
In this study, the inhibitory activity of Troα6 was diminished 
with mutant W116A but not mutant M117A (Figure 2B), indi-
cating that tryptophan is critical for the activity expression of 
Troα6. Alanine scanning of Troα10 in collagen-induced plate-
let aggregation experiment demonstrated that the Gly,1 Phe,2 
Cys,3 Trp,5 and Cys10 residues are important for the activity of

cytometric analysis of FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated decapeptide binding to platelets. Specific binding was calculated by 
subtracting the nonspecific binding (probed by FITC-conjugated BSA) from total binding observed (probed by FITC-conjugated deca-
peptide). B, Recombinant GPVI (rhGPVI [recombinant human GPVI]) was immobilized on ELISA plate, and then incubated with different 
concentrations of biotin-conjugated Troα10. Signal intensity was measured at 450 nm by ELISA reader (n=4). C, Platelet lysate and pro-
teins eluted from biotinylated decapeptide-bound Streptavidin Sepharose beads were blotted with anti-integrin β1 (upper) and anti-GPVI 
antibodies. D, Type I collagen was immobilized on 96 well plate, and then incubated with rhGPVI in the absence or presence of Troα10 
or 326E12. E, Washed human platelets were preincubated with Troα10 at 37°C for 3 min. After incubation, platelets were stimulated with 
collagen (COL, 3 μg/mL) or convulxin (CVX, 5 ng/mL) to trigger platelet aggregation. Results are expressed as percentage of inhibition. 
Data are represented as binding percentage of 4 independent experiments. **P<0.01 compared with control (collagen–rhGPVI binding).

Troα10 (Figure 2E). Structural modeling of snaclecs has been 
a fairly useful approach for establishing putative binding sites 
on their surfaces, based on the premise that interactions with 
ligands involve electrostatic, as well as shape-matching inter-
actions. There are only a few laboratories that are conducting 
functional studies to prove the importance of these potential 
ligand-receptor-binding residues. This study is one of the pio-
neering functional studies to investigate the effect of snaclecs 
fragments and their mutants on platelet aggregation.
We propose that Troα10 inhibits collagen-induced aggre-
gation via interacting with GPVI by the following evidence: 
(1) Troα10 binds to immobilized GPVI in a concentration-
dependent manner (Figure 3B) and (2) the eluted platelet 
membrane proteins bound to biotinylated Troα10 were recog-
nized by anti-GPVI mAb (Figure 3C). Our docking result also 
showed that the possible GPVI-binding sites of decapeptide are 
located at the lower surface of D1 domain and outer surface of 
D2 domain (Figure 4B) and are different from that of 326E12 or 
collagen. The polyclonal antibodies against binding surface at 
the D2 domain showed inhibitory effects on collagen-induced 
platelet aggregation, indicating that surface at the D2 domain 
of GPVI is a novel and important binding epitope on GPVI-
mediated platelet aggregation. We also compared the GPVI 
sequences at the Troα10-binding site between human and 
mouse. In the sequence of Troα10-binding site in the mouse 
GPVI, there are 4 different residues from human: GLN13 (LEU 
in human), ILE86 (VAL in human), ARG136 (ASN in human), 
and LYS139 (ARG in human). However, the decapeptide only 
interacts with LEU13 and ASN136 using hydrogen bonds with 
the carboxyl groups at the peptide main chain in human GPVI. 
At the residues 86 and 139, these amino acids differences are of 
similar amino acid types with positive charges (ARG and LYS). 
It is reasonable to assume similar interactions at potential bind-
ing sites of D1/D2 domain between human and mouse GPVI.
Our present results demonstrated that Troα6/Troα10 inhib-
ited platelet responses to collagen ex vivo without causing 
thrombocytopenia and delayed the occlusion time of irradia-
tion-induced thrombus formation in vivo, but did not prolong 
bleeding time (Figure 5). Up to date, there are few small-
mass GPVI inhibitors reported as efficacious antithrombotic, 
although many anti-GPVI antibodies and GPVI mimetics have 
been reported. Recently, a dimeric GPVI-Fc (fragment crys-
tallizable) (Revacept), which can bind to collagen with high 
affinity, was classified as a GPVI mimic.19 There are some dif-
ferences between our decapeptide and Revacept as follows: (1) 
Revacept, a GPVI-mimicking fusion protein, competitively 
blocks the GPVI-binding site of collagen; Troα10, a small mol-
ecule GPVI-function blocking agent, binds to GPVI, interfer-
ing with collagen-GPVI interaction and (2) the administration 
route of Revacept is limited to injection, whereas Troα10 may 
be used orally after optimized transformation into nonpeptide 
mimetics. We provide a novel skeleton for developing specific 
small-mass antagonist of platelet GPVI for prevention of arte-
rial thrombosis. We are now developing an in silico peptide 
design by Greedy approach20 with system mutation inspired 
from similar in vitro study.21 The spirit of Greedy is collecting 
best components to optimize the composed product. Instead 
of estimating all the possible potential mutations (which we 
would need to analyze 20n peptides), we only estimate 20×n 
mutations with only 1 mutant position at a time.
Antiplatelet drugs are commonly used in thrombogenic 
diseases, but acute profound thrombocytopenia is a recog-
nized complication of treatment with antiplatelet drug (eg, 
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors), and the cause is not yet fully known. 
Thrombocytopenia may be associated with a variety of condi-
tions, and life-threatening bleeding is one of its worst side effects. 
Because GPVI expression deficiency is usually only associated 
with slightly prolonged bleeding times, it is worth to develop

novel GPVI antagonists for thrombogenic diseases. We demon-
strated Troα6/Troα10 specifically inhibited collagen-induced 
platelet aggregation via interacting with platelet GPVI at novel 
binding epitope. They exhibited a marked antithrombotic effect 
in vivo with a minimal bleeding side effect. Their action as a 
specific small-mass GPVI antagonist provides a promising novel 
molecular skeleton for designing the new class of antithrombotic 
agents targeting platelet GPVI with limited bleeding side effect.
Figure 5. Effects of hexapeptide and decapeptide in ex vivo and in vivo studies. A, The aggregation response of platelet-rich plasma 
(PRP) prepared from mice treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; CTL), hexapeptide (Troα6 [trowaglerix a chain hexapeptide, 
CKWMNV], 30 mg/kg), or decapeptide (Troα10, 8 mg/kg) was induced by collagen (5 μg/mL). This experiment is representative of at least 
6 similar experiments. B, Effect of PBS (CTL), Troα6 (30 mg/kg), Troα10 (10 mg/kg), or aspirin (250 mg/kg) on fluorescent dye-induced 
thrombus formation, in the irradiated mesenteric vunules of mice. The time to occlusion (TTO) is presented as mean±SEM (n≥6). C, Mea-
surement of carotid artery blood flow after ferric chloride injury. Complete occlusion time was recorded from the time at which ferric chlo-
ride solution was removed from the surface of artery. Troα10 (8 mg/kg) was administered 3 min before the initiation of vascular injury. This 
experiment is representative of at least 3 similar experiments. D, Bleeding time was measured 5 min after the intravenous injection of PBS 
(CTL), Troα6 (30 mg/kg), Troα10 (8 mg/kg), tirofiban (0.4 mg/kg), or aspirin (250 mg/kg). Bleeding time longer than 10 min was expressed 
as >10 min. The average bleeding time is indicated as (—). Each different symbol represents the bleeding time of an individual mouse.

Highlights
• Trowaglerix venom polypeptides inhibit collagen-induced aggregation via interacting with platelet glycoprotein VI receptor D1/D2 domain and 
displayed antithrombotic effect in vivo.
• The outer surface of the D2 domain of glycoprotein VI is a novel and important binding epitope on glycoprotein VI–mediated platelet aggrega-
tion.
• Small-mass peptides derived from snaclecs (snake venom C-type lectin protein) may be the new class of antithrombotic agents targeting 
platelet glycoprotein VI with limited bleeding side effect.
