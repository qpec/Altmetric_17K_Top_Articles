Dengue burden in India: recent trends and importance
of climatic parameters

For the past ten years, the number of dengue cases has gradually increased in India. Dengue is driven by complex interactions
among host, vector and virus that are influenced by climatic factors. In the present study, we focused on the extrinsic incubation
period (EIP) and its variability in different climatic zones of India. The EIP was calculated by using daily and monthly mean
temperatures for the states of Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Kerala. Among the studied states, a faster/low EIP in
Kerala (8–15 days at 30.8 and 23.4 °C) and a generally slower/high EIP in Punjab (5.6–96.5 days at 35 and 0 °C) were
simulated with daily temperatures. EIPs were calculated for different seasons, and Kerala showed the lowest EIP during the
monsoon period. In addition, a significant association between dengue cases and precipitation was also observed. The results
suggest that temperature is important in virus development in different climatic regions and may be useful in understanding
spatio-temporal variations in dengue risk. Climate-based disease forecasting models in India should be refined and tailored for
different climatic zones, instead of use of a standard model.

INTRODUCTION
Dengue is a vector-borne disease that is a major public health threat
globally. It is caused by the dengue virus (DENV, 1–4 serotypes),
which is one of the most important arboviruses in tropical and
subtropical regions.1,2 Other arboviral diseases are present in India,
including Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus, chikungunya fever,
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Kyasanur forest disease. Since
the mid-1990s, epidemics of dengue in India have become more
frequent, especially in urban zones, and have quickly spread to new
regions, such as Orissa, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram, where
dengue was historically non-existent.3 The epidemiology of dengue in
India was first reported in Madras (now Chennai) in 1780, and the
first outbreak occurred in Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1963; subsequent
outbreaks have been reported in different parts of India.4,5 Since 1956,
four serotypes (one to four) of dengue virus have been reported in
various parts of the country.6 The total number of dengue cases has
significantly increased in India since 2001. In the early 2000s, dengue
was endemic in a few southern (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu
and Pondicherry) and northern states (Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana,
Punjab and Chandigarh). It has recently spread to many states,
including the union territories.3 In addition to the increased number
of cases and disease severity, there has also been a major shift in the
geographical range of the disease. Dengue had been restricted to urban
areas, but it has now spread to rural regions.7 The expansion of
dengue in India has been related to unplanned urbanization, changes
in environmental factors, host–pathogen interactions and population
immunological factors. Inadequate vector control measures have also
created favorable conditions for dengue virus transmission and its
mosquito vectors. Both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the main
competent vectors for dengue virus in India.8 The number of dengue
cases has increased 30-fold globally over the past five decades.9 Dengue
is endemic in more than 100 countries and causes an estimated 50
million infections annually.10 Nearly 3.97 billion people from 128
countries are at risk of infection.11,12 Individuals infected with dengue
exhibit a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from asympto-
matic to severe clinical manifestations, such as dengue shock
syndrome.13 The WHO regions of Southeast Asia (SEA) and the
western Pacific represent ~ 75% of the current global burden of
dengue.14 A dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia(R), has been registered in
several countries. Dengvaxia(R) is a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine
that is currently under evaluation in phase 3 clinical trials in Asia
(Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) and Latin
America (Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Puerto Rico).15
The protective efficacy of Dengvaxia(R) against virologically confirmed
dengue in the respective individual trials has been estimated to range
between 50.2% and 76.6% for different ages and serotypes.16
Dengvaxia(R) has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare, Government of India, because more clinical trials
are
thought
to
be
necessary
in
India.17

 pharmaceutical companies are developing an indigenous dengue
vaccine candidate that protects against all four strains in clinical
manifestations.18
Dengue outbreaks in SEA were recorded as early as the late 1940s,
and they have continued to the present, exhibiting a larger disease
burden. Dengue has been hyperendemic for decades in SEA, which
has the highest reported incidence19 and is one of the most important
hotspots, with a series of epidemics occurring every 3–5 years.20
Approximately 87% of the total population in the SEA region is at
risk of dengue.21 In India, compared with other Asian countries,
dengue was not widespread before the 1990s.
Many studies have reported changing spatial patterns in dengue
transmission. The reasons for such changes are related to several
factors, ranging from the globalization of travel and trade, which
favors the propagation of pathogens and vectors, to climatic changes
or modified human behavior.22–24 In 2007, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change cautioned that between 1.5 and 3.5 billion
people worldwide will face the risk of dengue fever infection during
the 2080s, owing to climate change.25 Temperature and precipitation
are important climatic factors in mosquito population and disease
transmission dynamics.26 Temperature influences the developmental
rates, mortality and reproductive behavior of mosquitoes. Precipita-
tion provides the water that serves as a habitat for larvae and
pupae.26,27 According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, the global average temperature has increased by ~ 0.6 °C over
the past 35 years, and the variation in precipitation has increased.28
Warm temperatures and high humidity favor increased longevity of
the adult mosquitoes and shorten the viral incubation period within
the vector and its blood-feeding intervals, thus leading to faster virus
replication and increased transmission intensity.29 The association
between weather and dengue varies across geographical locations and
socio-environmental strata.30,31
Precipitation is often required to create and maintain breeding sites
and consequently has a strong influence on vector distribution.
Dengue is endemic in Thailand and Latin American countries, where
a positive association between dengue prevalence and rainfall has been
reported.32,33 Aguiar et al.14 have shown that the risk of dengue
infection in Brazil is highly seasonal and increases primarily during the
rainy season, when vector infestation reaches its peak.14 Similarly,
studies have also reported that in wetter conditions, compared with
drier conditions, mosquitoes expand their spatial range, thereby
leading to increased risk of dengue infection.34 In contrast, dry
conditions can also lead to epidemics in urban settings, because
vulnerable people with little access to water resources tend to store
water in unprotected reservoirs near their households. This water
attracts Ae. aegypti, which is anthropophilic, thus further increasing
the risk of transmission.35,36 In South American countries, several
studies have shown a significant relationship between the warm phase
of El Niño Southern Oscillation and dengue outbreaks.37,38
The climate of South Asia is highly influenced by the Asian
monsoon. India receives 75% of its rainfall during the southwest
monsoon period from June to September.39 Indian monsoon rainfall
provides ample breeding habitats for Ae. aegypti, thus leading to high
vector densities.36 For tropical zones, including India, dengue is highly
seasonal, and very limited research has been conducted to estimate the
influence of climatic factors on the burden of dengue.
The extrinsic incubation period (EIP) is the viral incubation period
between the time when a mosquito draws a viremic blood meal and
the time when that mosquito becomes infectious. Since the 1900s, the
EIP has been recognized as an important factor in dengue transmis-
sion dynamics.40 Vector competence and horizontal transmission of
dengue highly depend on the EIP.41 Many studies have revealed that
temperature influences the EIP; at higher temperatures within a viable
survival temperature range for the vector, the DENV replicates faster,
and the EIP shortens and increases the chance of a high proportion of
mosquitoes becoming infective during their life span.42,43 The EIP is
an important determinant of the temporal dynamics of DENV
transmission.44
The EIP plays an important role in modulating the occurrence of
dengue cases/outbreaks in a given region. Decreasing the incubation
period by 5 days can lead to a threefold higher transmission rate of
dengue, and raising the temperature from 17 to 30 °C increases
dengue transmission fourfold.45 Higher temperatures may increase the
amount of feeding within the gonotrophic cycle, given the smaller
body
size
and
enhanced
metabolism
resulting
from
higher
temperatures.46 Rohani et al.47 have reported that the EIP decreases
when the extrinsic incubation temperature increases from 9 days at
26 °C to 5 days at 30 °C. Most researchers have examined the EIP of
dengue virus type 2, whereas Rohani et al.47 have also examined the
EIP for dengue virus type 4.
The EIP is generally assumed to range between 8 and 12 days.9,48,49
Most dengue models use fixed values for the duration of the EIP, and
very few experimental studies have been carried out in this
direction.50–52
Climatologically, the Indian climate is distinct, including six
climatic zones. To understand the EIP in these different climatic
zones, five dengue-endemic states (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan,
Gujarat and Kerala) were selected to characterize changes in the EIP
by using daily and monthly mean temperatures. Similarly, this study
also further assessed the effect of rainfall on dengue burden.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Epidemiological data
The dengue surveillance system in India is a passive surveillance
system, wherein dengue cases are diagnosed by public health care
professionals at different levels, for example, in sub-centers (at the
village level), primary health centers (intermediate structures) and
community health centers (with more than 30 beds). These health
centers report the number of confirmed laboratory dengue cases to the
district medical officer, who then forwards the information to the state
government. The disease surveillance system is carried out by the state
government and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program
(NVBDCP). The NVBDCP reviews the dengue in different states of
India and systematically maintains the case data. Periodic reviews and
field visits are made by health officials to review the dengue incidence
and record the data daily. The NVBDCP, of the Government of India,
reviews these data and provides technical assistance, funding and
commodities to the endemic states and union territories. In addition
to the NVBDCP, an integrated disease surveillance program was also
established by the Government of India in 1999, and it covers 600
districts in India.53
For the effective control of disease outbreaks, rapid and precise
diagnosis of dengue is of paramount importance. In India, dengue is
diagnosed primarily on the basis of clinical manifestations (such as
high fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash and
hemorrhagic manifestations) and laboratory diagnosis.54 Dengue cases
are confirmed in the laboratory by the MAC ELISA method on the
basis of the detection of IgM antibodies.
EIP model
The country-level EIP was calculated by using the monthly mean
temperatures for 1998–2014 from NCEP2 reanalysis temperature data.

 Similarly, the daily EIP was calculated for each day of the year by using
the daily mean NCEP2 temperature data, and the seasonal EIP was
also calculated by using the daily mean temperature. We calculated the
EIP at different temporal scales to obtain EIP ranges for different
climatic zones of India.
To investigate the effect of temperature on the extrinsic incubation
period of dengue virus in India, we used the model described by
McLean et al.42 This model relates the EIP with temperature as a
covariate.42 The EIP (n, in days) was estimated for each state on the
basis of temperature (T, in °C), by using the following equation:

 forecast system to perform data assimilation on the basis of past
observed data. This data set is available on a T62 global Gaussian grid
(~1.8°× 1.8°) from 1979 to present, in daily time steps. Rainfall was
derived from the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data
set. The TRMM data set is a satellite product that uses a ground
rainfall station for calibration. The TRMM is available on a
0.25° × 0.25° spatial grid covering the tropics from 1998 to present
at a daily time step. The TRMM was originally designed to improve
observations of rainfall over the tropics.56 The annual means for
rainfall and the maximum, minimum and mean temperature in India
are shown in Figure 1. The average temperatures and rainfall for the
five states of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Kerala are
shown in Table 1.
Statistical analysis
A bivariate Pearson correlation coefficient test was used to detect
correlations between annual dengue cases and rainfall in Punjab,
Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Kerala. The level of significance was
considered to be 0.05. The correlation analysis was calculated by using
the SPSS statistical software (version 22).
RESULTS
Epidemiological context of dengue in India
Since the 1990s, epidemics of dengue have become more frequent in
many parts of India. Over the period 1998–2009, 82 327 dengue cases
(incidence: 6.34 per million population) were reported. During a more
recent period (2010–2014), 213 607 cases (incidence: 34.81 per million
population) of dengue fever were observed. Thus, the number of
dengue cases during the past 5 years has increased markedly, by a
factor of ~ 2.6, with respect to the 1998–2009 period (Figure 2).
The 1996 dengue epidemic that occurred around Delhi and in
Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, subsequently spread all over the country,
causing 16 000 cases and 545 deaths. The dengue incidence sharply
increased from 1998 to 2001 from 0.72 to 3.21 per million population.
In 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009, the dengue incidence exceeded
10 per million population. Since 2010, a dengue incidence of greater
than 15 per million population has been reported annually (Figure 2).
From 2010 onward, the states of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and
Uttarakhand and some union territories including Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu have
become endemic for dengue. India experienced the highest dengue
incidence in 2012 (about 41 per million population), 2013 (61 per
million population) and 2014 (32 per million population).
From 1998 to 2014, the highest dengue incidence was reported in
Pondicherry (372.92), followed by Dadra Nagar Haveli (176.31) and
Delhi (102.15). Similarly, high dengue incidence, ranging between 21
and 50 per million, was reported for the states of Punjab, Gujarat,
Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Orissa (Figure 3).
Mean climatic conditions in India
The Indian monsoon, which usually starts in June and ends in
September–October, brings rainfall from the Indian Ocean to the land.
The highest level of precipitation occurs over the western coasts of
India (states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala) and the far
eastern states (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura
and Meghalaya). More moderate rainfall is observed over the south-
eastern coasts (Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry), the eastern states and
over the northern states bordering the Himalayas (Figure 1). Mean

 annual temperatures generally lie within the 20–30 °C range for most
Indian states (Figure 1) except for the northern mountain states
(Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal), where more
extreme cold winter conditions prevail.
Temperature influence on dengue virus development within the
mosquito vector
To understand the role of temperature on the development of dengue
virus, five states in India were selected: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan,
Gujarat and Kerala. These states were selected because they are very
different in nature, both geographically and climatologically. Punjab
and Haryana are humid, subtropical states, and they are located in
northern India. Rajasthan and Gujarat states encompass an arid zone
and are located in western India. The southern state of Kerala is
located in a tropical wet and warm region. The mean annual
temperatures for these five states, from the warmest to the coldest,
were 27.3 °C (Kerala), 21 °C (Gujarat), 16.6 °C (Rajasthan), 14.8 °C
(Haryana) and 10.1 °C (Punjab). Among these five states, the highest
average dengue incidence from 1998 to 2014 was reported for the state
of Kerala (49.27 per million population), followed by Punjab (44.89),
Gujarat (21.04), Haryana (16.54) and Rajasthan (15.38). The state-
and year-specific dengue cases for these five states are further shown in
Figure 4.
The EIPs estimated by using daily mean temperature data for each
studied state are shown in Figure 4. For the humid, subtropical state of
Punjab, the virus development period was predicted to range between
5.6 (at 35 °C) and 96.4 (at 0 °C, see Figure 5) days. These simulated
EIPs were compared with those of another subtropical and humid
state, Haryana. The EIP in Haryana ranged between 4 (at 39.8 °C) and
80.7 (at 2.3 °C) days (Figure 5) on the basis of the daily mean
temperature. These two states showed long EIPs, owing to the low
temperatures reported after the monsoon period. The semi-arid
Rajasthan state showed EIP values ranging from 3.6 (at 41.4 °C) to
85.3 (at 1.6 °C) days (Figure 5). Similarly, in Gujarat, the EIP ranged
from 5 (36.8 °C) to 38.8 (11.5 °C) days on the basis of the daily
temperature (Figure 5). The wettest and warmest state, Kerala, showed
a narrow range of EIP values, varying from 8.3 (at 30.8 °C) to 15 (at
23.4 °C) days (Figure 5).
The mean annual EIP estimated by using monthly mean tempera-
tures for India is shown in Figure 6. The eastern and western coasts of

 India showed the lowest EIP values, whereas the central, northern and
northeastern parts showed higher EIP values. The northern and
northeastern parts of India are highland areas and are located in the
foothills of the Himalayas, where low temperatures are generally
reported, thus leading to high EIP values. The lowest EIP values were
mainly in the coastal states of India (Figure 6), a result relatively
consistent with the dengue hotspots observed in Figure 3.
Seasonal EIP prediction
In India, the climate is generally divided into four seasons: (a) the pre-
monsoon season/summer period (March–May), (b) the monsoon
period (June–August), (c) the post-monsoon period (September–
November) and (d) winter (December–February). The temperature
varies substantially across seasons, thus affecting EIP dynamics. The
EIP was calculated for different seasons by using daily temperatures.
The EIPs for the studied states during different seasons are shown in
Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1. Among all of the states, Kerala
showed the lowest EIP (8–12.5 days) during the pre-monsoon period,
followed by a similar range of EIPs observed in the winter, monsoon
and post-monsoon periods (9–14.9 days). Gujarat showed low EIPs
(5–13.5 days) during the monsoon period and again nearly similar
pre-monsoon and post-monsoon EIPs (5.83–25.4, see Supplementary
Figure S1).
In Punjab, the mean (±95% CI) EIP estimated using daily
temperature
was
24.48 ± 0.24
days
at
19.4 °C,
Haryana:
16.98 ± 0.17 days at 23.9 °C, Rajasthan: 14.28 ± 0.15 days at 26.3 °C
and Kerala: 11.07 ± 0.01 days at 27.3 °C. Similarly, the mean (±95%
CI) EIPs for different seasons predicted from daily temperatures are
highlighted in Table 2, which indicates that the risk of dengue is
particularly high during the monsoon period, when the EIP appears to
be at a minimum in most states.
The correlation coefficients between annual dengue incidence and
annual EIP at the state level showed low values (see Supplementary
Table S1), thus indicating poor model performance in reproducing the
observed annual dengue burden from year to year. This poor
performance may be due to many reasons (for example, changes in
surveillance across different states, or the virus still not being
introduced in a given state). In contrast, the mean dengue incidence
and simulated EIP showed significant negative spatial correlation
(r = − 0.33; P = 0.94). This result indicates that the EIP model based
only on temperature is able to discriminate among states with low/
high dengue burden.
Precipitation and dengue cases
To understand the role of rainfall on dengue transmission, annual
rainfall data were extracted for the dengue-endemic states of Punjab,
Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Kerala. Pearson correlation analysis
showed a moderate to strong positive association between dengue
cases and total precipitation, as well as rainy days greater than 1 mm
or greater than 10 mm. The states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and
Kerala showed significant associations between dengue cases and
annual rainfall, as well as rainy days greater than 1 mm and greater
than 10 mm, whereas the arid state of Gujarat did not show any
significant association between rainfall and dengue cases (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Dengue is a major public health problem in India. Some studies have
reported that an epidemiological shift in dengue viruses and climate
change might be responsible for the observed increase in dengue
burden across India.57,58 Studies have focused on several epidemiolo-
gical and entomological aspects of dengue and to a lesser extent on
understanding the relevance of climatic factors, but none have
investigated the extrinsic incubation period of the dengue virus within
the mosquito vector. This is the first study to estimate the extrinsic
incubation period by using temperature data for different states of
India. The EIP plays a major role in dengue-endemic regions, where
the vectors ingest the virus through a blood meal, and the virus
escapes the mid gut, passes through the mosquito body and finally
reaches the salivary glands and can be transmitted to another
susceptible host. Most modeling studies have considered static EIP
values rather than dynamic EIP estimates for a particular region.59 In
this study, instead of using fixed values, we estimated EIPs by using
daily mean temperatures for dengue-endemic Indian states and
examined the association with the overall dengue burden at the
Figure 4

 country level and for five dengue-endemic states in India. This study
also investigated EIPs for different seasons to understand dengue virus
transmission dynamics.
The Indian climate is highly influenced by the Indian monsoon
system. During the boreal summer, southwesterly winds bring
moisture from the Indian Ocean to the land, thus resulting in heavy
rains across India during the southwest monsoon period. This is
followed by the northeast monsoon. Recent studies have shown that
seasonal mean temperature in India has increased significantly over
the past 100 years, with an increase of 0.9 °C during the post-monsoon
period and 1.1 °C during winter.60 Slight increases in temperature can
increase the dengue risk by increasing the mosquito development rate
and shortening the virus incubation time, thereby increasing the rate
of transmission. In India, temperature varies in different climatic
zones at both temporal and spatial scales, and these variations
influence the EIP. This influence is very pronounced in Punjab,
Haryana and Rajasthan, where the EIP generally exceeds the average
life span (45–49 days) of both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus
mosquitoes, even during intense dengue transmission periods (Punjab
only).61,62
Some studies have reported that daily temperature variation may
play a major role in dengue virus transmission and vector–pathogen
interactions.63,64 Similarly, understanding of ectotherm ecology has
improved, thus providing novel ideas on how to quantify the impact
of anthropogenic climate change on pest and disease risk.65,66 In
general, the EIP for dengue ranges between 8 and 12 days.9 Chan and
Johansson44 have calculated the mean EIP for a village in Taiwan,
finding EIP values of 15 days at 25 °C and 6.5 days at 30 °C, whereas
our study predicted 13 days at 25 °C and 9 days at 30 °C.44 Most
studied states showed low EIP values during the monsoon period,

 whereas other seasons had large spatial variation in the EIP (Table 2).
The northwestern parts of India usually exhibited low-temperature
conditions during the late post-monsoon or winter periods, owing to
cold conditions. In cool temperature settings, DENV cannot repro-
duce in mosquitoes, and transmission does not occur. An experi-
mental study has also shown that below 18 °C, the virus cannot be
found in the vector’s salivary glands, whereas at 21 °C, the viral antigen
is detectable in Ae. albopictus.67 Similarly, above 20 °C, the dengue
incidence gradually increases and peaks at ~ 32 °C before declining at
higher temperatures.68
The EIP for dengue viruses has been found to decrease when the
temperature increases from 26 to 30 °C, results similar to our
findings.47 In tropical countries, including India, these temperatures
are generally experienced during monsoon or early post-monsoon
periods. Among the five states studied, Kerala experiences the highest
number of dengue cases, possibly because of the availability of
breeding grounds, a higher percentage of infected mosquitoes, suitable
temperature ranges (23.5–30 °C) and subsequent short incubation
periods in all seasons (9–14 days) and during the rainy season. These
temperature ranges are mostly suitable for mosquito development and
virus transmission. Similar studies have also reported a high pre-
valence of dengue in Mexico during the rainy season, when
temperatures typically range between 17 and 30 °C.45
Temperatures in the lower range of dengue distribution (~17–18 °C)
limits disease transmission through its effect on the EIP. High
temperatures (~35 °C, depending on the vector species) tend to
decrease disease risk, because they can limit mosquito survival.
Consequently, future climate change might further affect dengue
burden and that of other vector-borne diseases in India. In cooler
areas, where temperature is a limiting factor, a slight increase in
temperature might lead to disease transmission. As an example,
dengue virus and its vectors have rapidly expanded their range into
Himalayan countries, such as Nepal and Bhutan, as well as into
northern states of India, such as Darjeeling, over the past 10 years.69
A recent study has compiled all dengue outbreaks in India3,
showing that most dengue outbreaks occurred in Punjab, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Gujarat and Kerala states during the monsoon or post-
monsoon period. Thus, all study states are influenced by strong
seasonality, underscoring the roles of both rainfall and ambient
temperature in the potential transmission of dengue virus during
monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Further studies are required to
develop seasonal forecasting of dengue incidence in India.
During the past few decades, Aedes vectors have expanded their
geographical range. Apart from dengue, Aedes vectors can also
transmit other arboviruses, such as chikungunya and Zika virus.70
Chikungunya is already widespread in many countries, including
India, whereas Zika virus is now an emerging arbovirus, and it has a
similar epidemiology and transmission cycle to that of dengue virus in
the tropical world.71 This study had some limitations, including the
need to understand the incubation period according to serotype and
by mosquito species. Our study highlights the association between
weather and the EIP for different states of India, and we show that it is
very difficult to develop a general model for the entire country. Hence,
future studies should focus on the development of forecasting models
by climatic zone and season. Other important parameters, including
socioeconomic and demographic factors such as population density
