Context: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) favorably affects bone mineral density (BMD).
Whether MHT also affects bone microarchitecture, as assessed by trabecular bone score (TBS), has
never been evaluated.
Objective: Our objective was to assess the effect of MHT on TBS and BMD before and after its
withdrawal.
Design: This was a cross-sectional study.
Setting: This study included the general community.
Patients or other participants: Data were collected from the OsteoLaus cohort (1500 women aged
50–80 years). After exclusion of women with bone-modulating treatments, 1279 women were
categorized according to MHT status into current (CU), past (PU), and never (NU) users.
Main outcome measure(s): Spine TBS and BMD at lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip were
assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry.
Results:Age-andbodymassindex-adjustedanalysisshowedhigherTBSvaluesinCUvsPUorNU(1.31�
0.01, 1.29 � 0.01, and 1.27 � 0.01, respectively; P � .001). All BMD values were significantly higher in
CU vs PU or NU. Compared to NU, PU exhibited higher lumbar spine (0.94 � 0.01 vs 0.91 � 0.01 g/cm2;
P � .017) and total hip (0.86 � 0.01 vs 0.84 � 0.01 g/cm2; P � .026) BMD and a trend for higher TBS (P �
.066). The 10-year loss of TBS and BMD at lumbar spine and total hip was significantly lower for both
CU and PU vs NU. MHT duration had no effect on bone parameters. In PU, the residual effect on TBS
and BMD was significantly more prominent in early discontinuers (�2 years).
Conclusion: MHT is associated with bone microarchitecture preservation, as assessed by TBS. The
effect of MHT on TBS and BMD persists at least 2 years after withdrawal. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab

steoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease character-
ized by low bone mass and microarchitectural de-
terioration of bone tissue, resulting in increased bone fra-
gility and susceptibility to fracture (1). Bone mineral
density (BMD), measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA), is a major determinant of bone strength and frac-
ture risk (2). Nevertheless, one-half of fragility fractures
occur in individuals with BMD values in the osteopenic or
even normal range (3), highlighting the role of other fac-
tors on bone strength, such as bone microarchitecture. A
noninvasive assessment of the latter has been proposed by
the use of trabecular bone score (TBS). TBS is a textural

 index that evaluates pixel gray-level variations in the lum-
bar spine DXA image, providing an indirect index of tra-
becular microarchitecture (4). Multiple case-control stud-
ies, prospective trials (5, 6), and a meta-analysis (7) have
shown that TBS predicts fracture risk in postmenopausal
women, independently of clinical risk factors, BMD and
FRAX tool. In 2015, TBS was added in the FRAX tool to
evaluate the 10-year fracture risk.
Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was for many
years a first-line therapy in the prevention of postmeno-
pausal osteoporosis. This practice was supported by ob-
servational data. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)
randomized trial was the first study to prove that MHT
reduces the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures
in postmenopausal women, even those at low risk of frac-
ture (8, 9). The trial concluded, however, that the bone
benefits are outweighed by other adverse events, particu-
larly an increase in breast cancer, coronary heart disease,
and strokes in the estrogen/progestin arm and an excess of
strokes in the estrogen-only arm. These conclusions led to
a diminishing clinical use of estrogen (10), with regulatory
bodies downgrading MHT to second-line therapeutic
choice for postmenopausal osteoporosis.
However, controversy persists about the validity of
these conclusions (11). Subgroup analysis of women aged
50–59 years at entry in the WHI trial showed favorable
long-term outcomes for cardiovascular disease and global
indexofhealth(12,13).Promisingevidenceforprotection
against bone loss has been reported with lower doses of
oral estrogen or transdermal administration (14). The lat-
ter most likely causes fewer less adverse vascular events
(15). As a result, the latest guidelines reestablish MHT as
a first-line treatment for the prevention of fracture in at-
risk women before age of 60 years or within 10 years after
menopause without any mandatory time limit for the du-
ration of treatment (16). The initiation of MHT after the
age of 60 years remains not recommended because of the
risk of long-term complications and the existence of al-
ternatives medications with a better safety profile.
Although the positive effect of MHT on BMD is well-
established, there are no available data on the direct in-
fluence of MHT on TBS. A small retrospective cohort
study assessed the longitudinal changes of BMD and TBS
in two different states of estrogen deprivation: natural
menopause and aromatase inhibitor treatment (17). After
a follow up of 2–3 years, TBS declined in both groups, but
to a lesser extent than BMD.
Given the renewed interest for MHT, we aimed to ex-
plore the effect of MHT on TBS and BMD before and after
its withdrawal using data from a large cross-sectional,
population-based study on osteoporosis in women con-
ducted in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Materials and Methods
Setting. Data from the OsteoLaus study were used (18). Osteo-
Laus is a substudy of the CoLaus study, an ongoing prospective
study aiming to assess the determinants of cardiovascular disease
using a population-based sample drawn from the city of Laus-
anne, Switzerland (19). Between September 2009 and September
2012, all women aged between 50 and 80 years from the CoLaus
study were invited to participate in the OsteoLaus study and
85% accepted. The OsteoLaus study was approved by the In-
stitutional Ethics Committee of the University of Lausanne. All
participants signed an informed consent.
At baseline, each patient had: 1) A questionnaire on potential
clinical risk factors for fracture/osteoporosis (including Swiss
FRAX assessment) and on conditions affecting bone metabo-
lism; 2) determination of the type, dose and duration of MHT;
3) a spine (L1 to L4) and femur DXA scan using the Discovery
A System (Hologic); 4) a blind central processing of TBS (TBS
iNsight v2.1, medimaps) based on a previously acquired antero-
posterior spine DXA scan; and 5) a vertebral fracture assessment
(VFA) by two experimented clinicians using the semiquantitative
approach of Genant (20).
Participants. A total of 1500 women were included in the Os-
teoLaus cohort; 58 were excluded from our analysis because of
uninterpretable lumbar spine images (extreme body mass index
[BMI] defined as �15 kg/m2 or �37 kg/m2, severe spine defor-
mations, osteosynthesis material, fewer than two evaluable ver-
tebrae). A total of 137 women were excluded for current or past
osteoporotic treatment other than MHT and 23 for current or
past exposure to aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen. Three oth-
ers cases were excluded because of congenital hyperostosis, an-
drogen treatment, and transsexuality.
According to MHT status, the remaining participants (n �
1279) were divided into three groups: current (CU), past (PU),
and never users (NU). The CU group was on MHT at trial entry
or discontinued MHT for less than 6 months (otherwise consid-
ered as PU). The CU group had followed MHT for at least 6
months (otherwise considered as NU). The PU group followed
MHT for at least 6 months (otherwise considered as NU) and
discontinued MHT at least 6 months before trial entry (other-
wise considered as CU).
Variables. BMD at lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, as well
as spine TBS were defined as the primary outcomes of the anal-
ysis. Age and BMI were considered as major confounders and
effect modifiers. Other variables of interest were prevalence of
vertebral fractures in VFA (defined as at least one fracture of
grade 2/3 and/or at least two fractures of grade 1), history of
fragility fractures (defined as low-trauma fractures, symptom-
atic or asymptomatically discovered on VFA), history of major
osteoporotic fractures (defined as fragility fractures in vertebrae,
hip, proximal humerus, distal forearm, and pelvis), and use of
supplements (defined as current or past use of calcium and/or
vitamin D). The 10-year fracture risk was calculated with the
Swiss FRAX tool.
Dietary calcium intake was assessed using a validated, semi-
quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which also includes
portion size (21). This food frequency questionnaire has been
validated in the Geneva population (22).

 Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were available for most
the participants (n � 1204, NU � 582, PU � 359, CU � 263)
from the second CoLaus visit that took place within 6 months
before the OsteoLaus visit. The plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D
level was measured using an ultrahigh pressure liquid chroma-
tography-tandem mass spectrometry system (23). The interday
coefficient of variation was 4.6% at 40 nmol/L.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using
Stata, v14.1 (StataCorp), for Windows. Descriptive results were
expressed as number of participants (percentage) or as average �
SD. Bivariate analyses were conducted using �2 for categorical
variables and ANOVA for continuous variables. Multivariate
analyses for continuous variables were conducted using
ANOVA or multiple regression; results were expressed either as
adjusted average � SE or as slope and (95% confidence interval
[CI]). Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using the
method of Scheffe. The association between bone outcomes and
time since MHT discontinuation was modeled by nonlinear re-
gression to identify possible hinges in the relationship. For each
bone parameter, the hinge and the slopes before and after the
hinge (when present) were estimated and their 95% CIs were
assessed by bootstrap with 100 replications. Statistical signifi-
cance was considered for a bivariate test with a P value � .05.
Results
Of the 1279 women included in the analysis, 282 (22%)
were CU, 380 (30%) were PU, and 617 (48%) were NU.
The vast majority of participants were of Caucasian eth-
nicity (1256/1279, 98.2%). Their baseline characteristics
according to MHT group are shown in Table 1. PU group
members were significantly older, had a higher prevalence
of fractures, took calcium and vitamin D supplements
more frequently, and had a higher 10-year fracture risk.
The latter was no longer present after adjustment for age.
No differences were found for BMI and dietary intake of
calcium. There was a significant difference regarding
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (CU�PU�NU),
which nonetheless remained slight with an average differ-
ence of 5.5 nmol/liter between CU and NU.
The results for the primary bone outcomes according to
MHTgroup,bothunadjustedandafteradjustmentforage
and BMI are shown in Table 2. CU group members had
consistently higher values of TBS and BMD at all sites

 compared with NU and PU members in both unadjusted
and adjusted models. After adjustment for age and BMI,
PU members showed higher lumbar spine and total hip
BMD than NU members (P � .017 and P � .026, respec-
tively). A trend in favor of PU vs NU was noted for TBS
values (P � .066).
The effect of MHT was also assessed by a multivariate
analysis with age as an independent variable (Table 3).
The adjusted slopes for 10-year increments showed a de-
crease of all-sites BMD and TBS loss according to MHT
status:CU�PU�NU(P�.05fortrend).Figure1provides
a graphic representation of BMI-adjusted slopes for asso-
ciation of BMD and TBS with age, according to MHT
group. CU group members exhibited significantly less
steep slopes for loss of TBS as well as BMD at all sites.
BMI-adjusted slopes for PU were significantly less steep
than those for NU, with the exception of the BMD at
femoral neck.
Table 4 shows the bone parameters according to MHT
duration and time since MHT withdrawal. No association
was found between MHT duration and bone outcomes in
the combined CU�PU group. In the PU group, all BMD
and TBS values were significantly higher when the time
since discontinuation was less than 2 years compared with
morethan5years.Amultivariateregressionanalysisusing
time since MHT discontinuation as a continuous variable
led to similar conclusions, whereas a hinge analysis (Table
5)allowedtheidentificationofaninflectionpointbetween
2 and 4 years since MHT discontinuation, beyond which
the benefit of MHT on bone outcomes has disappeared.
No statistically significant difference was noted between
the different bone outcomes (TBS, BMD at different sites)
in terms of inflection points.
Discussion
To maximize antifracture efficacy, agents against osteo-
porosis should ideally have an effect on both bone mass
and bone microarchitecture. TBS has emerged as a non-
invasive, easily acquired and reliable indirect indicator of
bone microarchitecture, providing an additional surro-
gate marker for fracture risk assessment (4). The effect of
antiosteoporotic drugs on TBS has been shown to be
smaller in magnitude than the one on BMD (4, 24). In a
substudy of the randomized Tamoxifen Exemestane Ad-
juvant Multicentre trial, Kalder et al explored the effect of
exemestane and tamoxifen on BMD and TBS in post-
menopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer
(25). After 2 years, TBS increased by 3.3% in the tamox-
ifen group compared to a decrease of 2.3% in the exemes-
tane group. The positive impact of tamoxifen on TBS
could suggest a potential advantage related with its estro-
genic agonist properties.
This cross-sectional analysis of the OsteoLaus cohort
demonstrates for the first time that MHT is associated
with higher levels of TBS. CU group members presented
significantly higher TBS values than in NU and PU mem-
bers. After adjustment for age and BMI, a trend for higher
TBS values in PU vs NU was observed. In the multivariate
analysis, slopes for 10-year increments were significantly
less steep in both CU and PU, indicating that MHT slows
down the age-associated loss of TBS. Interestingly, the
slopes for age-associated decline in TBS were significantly
more pronounced than those in spine BMD, a finding
which was attributed to TBS being less influenced by age-
induced osteoarthritic changes (4), which falsely elevate
spine BMD.

 The only clinical study that has analyzed the effect of
MHT on bone microarchitecture is the Kronos Early Es-
trogen Prevention Study (26). In a subset of this trial
(MHT n � 45 vs placebo n � 30), bone microarchitecture
was assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative
computed tomography at the distal radius. After 4 years of
follow-up, MHT prevented the decrease of cortical volu-
metric BMD as well as the increase of cortical porosity at
distal radius. Nevertheless, the degradation of trabecular
microarchitecture at the distal radius was not halted by
MHT. No trabecular assessment of the lumbar spine was
performed in the Kronos study, thus not allowing for a

The Benefit of MHT on Bone, the OsteoLaus Cohort

 direct comparison with our data. It is possible that the
beneficial effect of MHT on trabecular bone is not iden-
tical at all skeletal sites.
Our results confirm that current MHT use is associated
with higher BMD values at all relevant sites, a finding
consistent with previous randomized trials as well as a
meta-analysis (27). The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Pro-
gestin Intervention trial investigated the effect of MHT in
women in the early menopausal phase. After 3 years, those
assigned to MHT regimens had an average gain of 5.1%
and 2.4% at spine and total hip BMD, respectively, com-
pared to a loss of 2.8% and 2.2% in the placebo group
(28). In the relatively older population of the WHI trial
(29), after 3 years of follow-up, the percentage difference
in favor of the MHT group was 4.5% and 3.6% for BMD
at lumbar spine and total hip, respectively. MHT was ef-
fective despite the absence of osteoporosis at baseline
(mean T-scores: –1.3 at lumbar spine, –0.94 at total hip).
If the beneficial effect of MHT on BMD is well-estab-
lished, this is not the case for the BMD preservation after
its withdrawal. Our data argue in favor of a partially per-
sistent effect in PU group members, who showed higher
BMD values in the age-adjusted analysis as well as a less
rapiddecreaseofage-associatedBMDlossatlumbarspine
and total hip compared to NU. Further analysis confirmed
that time since MHT withdrawal is a crucial factor, with
early discontinuers (�2 years) presenting with signifi-
cantly higher BMD levels than the late ones (�5 years).
The inflection point, beyond which the BMD benefit dis-
appears, is estimated between 2 and 4 years.
Conflicting data exist about an eventual rebound effect
after MHT withdrawal resulting in rapid loss of the pre-
viously acquired benefit. Several nonrandomized studies
(30–32) did not find any accelerated bone loss after MHT
discontinuation. In the Prospective Epidemiologic Risk
Factor study (30), the dosage of bone remodeling markers
did not show increased bone resorption following MHT
withdrawal. However, in a randomized placebo-con-
trolled trial, Greenspal et al (33) revealed significant loss

neck, and total hip, respectively) 1 year after estrogen

in 425 hysterectomized women previously treated with
these agents vs placebo for 2 years. The loss of BMD ob-
served in the estrogen group was associated with an in-
crease of bone resorption markers. Similar results were
described in other trials of recently menopaused (34, 35)
or older women (36). In the latter study, there were no
significant BMD differences between PU and placebo
group already 2 years after estrogen withdrawal.
Possible explanations for these divergent results can be
hypothesized. In the Prospective Epidemiologic Risk Fac-
tor trial, the authors reported heterogeneous rates of bone
loss with faster decrease of BMD in women with lower
BMI. Trémollieres et al (35) also detected large variations
among MHT withdrawers. The rate of bone loss corre-
lated with age and vertebral BMD at the time of MHT
cessation but not with BMI. Differences regarding MHT
type and dose between different studies as well as the non-
assessment of 25-hydroxyvitamin D status in some trials
constitute additional factors possibly contributing to the
contradictory results. Because of our large sample cover-
ing the whole age spectrum of postmenopausal women,
we consider our results to be less dependent on individual
variables, thus being reliable for generalization to clinical
practice. In our cohort, the mean BMI was in the slightly
overweight range without differences between groups.
Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels differed slightly but
remained higher than 50 nmol/liter (� 20 �g/liter) in all
groups. Relatively high BMI and adequate plasma 25-hy-

 droxyvitamin D levels may have lessened excessive bone
resorption post MHT withdrawal, in contrast to other
studies.
Another interesting point is the between-sites discrep-
ancy with absence of residual effect on femoral neck,
whose content is rich in cortical bone. This finding has not
been reproduced in previous studies and should be con-
sidered cautiously until further evaluation, given that es-
trogen-deprivation states have been preferentially linked
to loss of trabecular bone.
BMD and TBS are surrogate markers of osteoporotic
fracture risk. Consequently, given our results in favor of a
residual effect in PU, we would expect decreased fracture
incidence in this group in comparison with NU. The re-
cently published National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence guidelines (37) on the effect of MHT recency
and duration on fracture incidence support this hypothe-
sis. Indeed, after an exhaustive meta-analysis and based
mostly on observational trials, the authors concluded that
bone benefits of MHT seem to persist after its withdrawal;
however, they have vanished by 5 years since MHT dis-
continuation. Data derived from randomized controlled
trials showed no effect of MHT duration on fracture risk,
whereas some observational studies suggested additional
benefits only for MHT duration longer than 10 years.
In agreement with these conclusions, we did not detect
any BMD differences according to MHT duration in the
combined CU�PU group. The most plausible explanation
is the accelerated gain of bone density at all sites during the
first 2 years of treatment, seen with MHT (29) and also
described for other antiresorptives. The increase of bone
density slows down during the next years of treatment
with a subsequent flattening of the changes, constituting
the overall duration of MHT a less decisive factor on bone
outcomes.
Our study has several limitations. First, the beginning
and the end of MHT were self-reported. Second, for the
same reason, we could not reliably distinguish the differ-
ent routes of administration of MHT (oral, transdermal,
vaginal) or the type of MHT (estrogen-alone or estrogen/
progestin). Third, we could not determine the dose of es-
trogen per participant, which can be important given the
potentially dose-dependent effects on bone outcomes. On
the other hand, our study has many strong points to be
taken into account. The large sample of the OsteoLaus
cohort allows for adequate statistical power to detect dif-
ferencesbetweengroups.Anotherstrengthisthequalityof
the data collected in the CoLaus and OsteoLaus cohorts.

In conclusion, we report here for the first time that
MHT is associated with better preservation of bone mi-
croarchitecture, as assessed by TBS. In addition to the
well-establishedpositiveeffectofMHTonBMD,thebone
microarchitecture preservation probably contributes to
the antifracture efficacy. The protective effect of MHT on
BMD and TBS seems to persist after its withdrawal for at
least 2 years. Given the renewed interest in MHT, our
