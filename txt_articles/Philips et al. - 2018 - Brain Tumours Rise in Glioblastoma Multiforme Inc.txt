Objective. To investigate detailed trends in malignant brain tumour incidence over a recent time period. Methods. UK Office of
National Statistics (ONS) data covering 81,135 ICD10 C71 brain tumours diagnosed in England (1995–2015) were used to calculate
incidence rates (ASR) per 100k person–years, age–standardised to the European Standard Population (ESP–2013). Results. We
report a sustained and highly statistically significant ASR rise in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) across all ages. The ASR for GBM
more than doubled from 2.4 to 5.0, with annual case numbers rising from 983 to 2531. Overall, this rise is mostly hidden in the
overall data by a reduced incidence of lower-grade tumours. Conclusions. The rise is of importance for clinical resources and brain
tumour aetiology. The rise cannot be fully accounted for by promotion of lower–grade tumours, random chance or improvement
in diagnostic techniques as it affects specific areas of the brain and only one type of brain tumour. Despite the large variation in
case numbers by age, the percentage rise is similar across the age groups, which suggests widespread environmental or lifestyle
factors may be responsible. This article reports incidence data trends and does not provide additional evidence for the role of any
particular risk factor.
1. Introduction
The causes of brain tumours in adults remain largely
unknown [1]. In 2011, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
prioritised the monitoring of detailed brain tumour incidence
trends through population–based cancer registries [2]. This
article reports recent changes in malignant brain tumour
incidence in England that include age, sex, morphology and
tumour location.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data. The International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD–O) is a dual classification, with coding sys-
tems for both topography and morphology [3]. The relevant
topology codes are listed in Table 1, along with the number of
tumours diagnosed in 1995 and 2015.
There are 102 different ICD–O–3.1 morphology codes
used in the data set, though many have few cases. The
morphology code describes the cell type and its biological
activity / tumour behaviour.
WHO last updated their classifications in 2016, but their
changes have minimal impact on our analysis of the data [4,
5]. Malignant brain neoplasms without histology are recorded
as ICD–10 D43 (D43.0 & D43.2 supratentorial).
We used anonymised individual–level national cancer
registration case data from the UK Office of National
Statistics (ONS) for all 81,135 ICD10–C71 category primary
malignant brain tumours diagnosed in England for the years
from 1995 to 2015, plus 8,008 ICD10–D43 supratentorial
malignant tumours without histology/morphology data from
1998–2015. The initial data is supplied by the National Cancer
Registration Service (NCRS). The ONS then apply further

validation checks and the UK Department of Health use the
ONS data to inform policy making. The ONS state their
cancer data are generally within 2% of the correct values [6].
Until about 2005, some cases in the oldest age–groups will
not have been recorded in the cancer registries. Since 2005
this error is likely to be small.
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most common and
most malignant primary tumour of the brain, is associated
with one of the worst five–year survival rates among all
human cancers, with an average survival from diagnosis
of only about 1 year. This ensures that few cases will be
unrecorded in the ONS database and we show that their
number of GBM tumours is similar to NHS hospital inpatient
numbers. The data include the year of diagnosis, age at
diagnosis, sex of patient, primary site and morphology
code. National population estimates of age and gender
by calendar year were also obtained from ONS data [7]
and age–specific incidence rates per 100,000 person–years
and for a wide variety of tumour types were calculated
in 5-year age group bins for males and females sepa-
rately.
Some published incidence analyses have used different
criteria as to which glioma and astrocytoma should be
considered malignant. WHO considers Grades I to IV as
biologically malignant even if they have not been graded
histologically malignant. We have taken the WHO/IARC
morphology behaviour codes /3, /6 and /9 as being histologi-
cally malignant which means that Grade I and II tumours are
classed as low–grade malignancies.
We are not aware of any specific bias in the ONS data.
There is a slight data–lag in cancer registry data, which are
regularly checked and updated if necessary, but are generally
stable after 3 to 5 years. Our ONS data extract is dated 4th July
2017.
Brodbelt et al. (2015) [8] reported an analysis of treatment
and survival for 10,743 GBM cases in England over the period
2007–2011, which had an overall median survival of only
6.1 months, rising to 14.9 months with maximal treatment.
Brodbelt et.al.’s GBM case total from English hospital data
is only 0.5% higher that our ONS GBM total of 10,687 cases
for the same time period; this suggests that a very complete
UK cancer diagnosis and registration system is now in place.
In contrast, Ostrom et al. (2015) [9] reporting on USA SEER
brain tumour data provide a scatter–plot that shows a median
complete registration and histological confirmation level of
only about 65%, with the best examples returning less than
75% full completion in 2012.
2.2. Confounding. We had a large number of categories and
sub–categories in the data. It was necessary to combine some
of these to increase the resolving power. We ran analyses
separately for each site (C71.0 to C71.9), for each main type of
tumour, and for tumour grade (I to IV). It was immediately
obvious that the most significant change was in the incidence
of GBM in frontal and temporal lobes. The obvious potential
confounders would be the C71.8 (overlapping) and C71.9
(unspecified) categories due to better imaging techniques and
we discuss this later.
2.3. Standardisation. Incidence rates rise dramatically with
age and standardisation is necessary as population age pro-
files are changing with time. We calculated age–standardised
incidence rates (ASR) per 100k person–years to the current
recommended European Standard Population (ESP–2013), as
it best represents the reality of the case burden on society [10].
Adjusting European cancer incidence to the World Standard
Population is not helpful as the age-spectra are so different.
Table 2 lists the morphology codes with the highest case
numbers, totalling 80354 tumours. Included in our analyses
are an additional 781 cases in 78 other categories, each with
fewer than 100 cases over the 21 years. A full listing of all the
cases in the data set is provided in the Supplementary File
[S1].
We needed to group data to improve resolution and
reduce random data noise. We examined infant and child

neoplasms separately, but did not find any statistically signif-
icant time–trends. Three age-groups seemed reasonable. We
chose a child, teenage and young-adult group (0-29), a main
middle-age group (30-54) and an older age group (over 55
years of age). These reasonably split the population into three
roughly equal (20, 18 and 16 million) groups of people. The
case totals in the three groups were about 9.5k, 19.5k and 52k
respectively. We tested moving the cut-point boundaries by
5 years in both directions and it made little difference to the
overall results.
2.4. Analysis. The cases were analysed by morphology, topol-
ogy, sex, age, age–specific and age–standardised incidence.
The Annual Average Percentage Change (AAPC) and cor-
responding 95% CI and p–values were calculated using
Stata SE12.1 (StataCorp). A linear model on the log of the
age–standardised rates, which tests for a constant rate of
change (e(ln(rate))), best fitted the data. See Supplementary File
sections [S2] and [S3].
2.5. Background. In a major 2013 review article, Hiroko
Ohgaki and Paul Kleihues [11] wrote “Glioblastoma is the
most frequent and malignant brain tumor. The vast majority
of glioblastomas (∼90%) develop rapidly de novo in elderly
patients, without clinical or histologic evidence of a less
malignant precursor lesion (primary glioblastomas). Sec-
ondary glioblastomas progress from low-grade diffuse astro-
cytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. They manifest in younger
patients, have a lesser degree of necrosis, are preferentially
located in the frontal lobe, and carry a significantly better
prognosis.”
Overall primary malignant brain tumour ASRs are only
rising slowly and are often considered fairly static. Figure 1
shows the age–standardised trends from 1971 to 2015. From
the 1970s to about 2000 there was a fairly steady rise in
recorded overall incidence, however since then the rise has
slowed, though clinicians have been reporting a rise in high-
grade, aggressive tumours.
Overall adult survival for all malignant brain tumours
after diagnosis during 2006–2010 was about 35% for one
year and 15% for five years, falling to about 3% for aggres-
sive grades–III and IV tumours. ONS data show age-
standardised death rates from malignant brain tumours (C71)
have increased by 7% between 2001 and 2015, showing that
improvements in treatment alone are inadequate and that
there is a need to find ways of preventing brain cancer [12].
3. Results
Comparing new case numbers in 2015 with 1995 shows an
extra 1548 aggressive GBM tumour cases annually. Figure 2

and Table 3 show that up to about 2004 the overall rise
in GBM incidence (Annual Average Percentage Change
(AAPC) 5.2%, 95% CI 3.7–6.6, p < 0⋅00003) could be mostly
compensated for by the fall in incidence of all lower grade
astrocytoma and “glioma, malignant, NOS, ICD10–93803”.
This leaves a fairly steady rise in the GBM ASR from 2004
to 2015 (AAPC 2.2%, 95% CI 1.4–3.0, p < 0.0001).
Ohgaki and Kleihues [11] reported that most secondary
GBMs are found in younger middle-age people and most
primary GBMs are in over 60s. We tested our (30–54) and
(>54) age group data, splitting the total GBM into de novo
and promoted tumours. We estimated the maximum possible
number of promoted tumours using the change in the grades
II and III diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas. The results are
shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b). These are discussed later.
We found a large decrease of ASR over time for Grade–II
diffuse astrocytoma, a slight rise in ASR for WHO Grade–III
anaplastic astrocytoma (94013; 2832 cases). There was little
change in rates of anaplastic oligodendroglioma (94513;
1339 cases), anaplastic ependymoma (93923; 313 cases)
Grade–II oligodendroglioma (94503; 2671cases), embryonal,
or ependymal tumours.
Figure 4 shows the relative increase in age-specific GBM
incidence between the averaged periods (1995–1999) and
(2011–2015) for 5–year age–groups. This 1.5-fold change
is remarkably similar across the age–groups, suggesting a
universal factor.
Figure 5 shows ASR GBM rates for frontal lobe, temporal
lobe, unspecified & overlapping (C71.8 & C71.9) and ‘all other
brain regions’
. Most of the rise is in the frontal and temporal
lobes, and most of the cases are in people over 55 years of age,
with a highly statistically significant overall AAPC of 7.6%
(see Table 4). There was an extra rise in frontal and temporal
GBM incidence between 2006 and 2008, which coincided
with a slight reduction in the GBM ASR in overlapping and
unspecified regions and may be due to improved imaging.
4. Discussion
Using sufficiently high–quality data, we present a clearer
picture of the changing pattern in incidence of brain tumour
types than any previously published. We report a sustained
and highly statistically significant ASR rise in GBM across
all ages and throughout the 21 years (1995–2015), which is
of importance both for clinical resources and brain tumour
aetiology.
Dobes et al. (2011) [13] reported a significant increase
in malignant tumour incidence from 2000 to 2008 in the
≥65–year age group. In a second article they noted an
increasing incidence of GBM (APC, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.5–5.6) in
patients in the same age group, especially in temporal and
frontal lobes [14]. De Vocht et al. (2011) [15] reported a rise in
temporal lobe tumour incidence in ONS data, but dismissed
its significance. In a 2016 paper he claimed no increase in
GBM incidence, but later published a major correction to the
paper that shows an increase [16].
Zada et al. (2012) [17] using USA SEER data for 1992–2006
reported a rising trend in frontal and temporal lobe tumours,
the majority of which were GBM, with a decreased incidence
of tumours across all other anatomical sub–sites. Ho et
al. (2014) [18] reported a 2.2–fold increase in glioblastoma
incidence in the Netherlands over the period 1989–2010 (APC
3.1, p<0.001).
There were no material classification changes over the
analysis period that might explain our findings [19], though
multidisciplinary team working was strengthened (2005
onwards) and better imaging has resulted in improved
diagnosis along with a more complete registration of brain
tumours in the elderly. We analysed our data in 5-year age
group categories to look for evidence of improved diagnosis;
the data do suggest diagnosis and registration have improved

in people aged over 70. However, at earlier ages the incidence
rate of ‘all’ glioma (and all C71) registrations have remained
almost constant, whereas the rates for lower–grade tumours
fell until about 2006 and have since remained fairly static as
the rate for GBM has risen steadily.
Most GBM cases seem to originate without any known
genetic predisposition. GBMs from promoted lower–grade
gliomas usually have different molecular genetic markers
from de novo GBMs [20]. The 2016 revision of the WHO
classification of CNS tumours [3, 4] highlights the need for
recording molecular genetic markers and divides glioblas-
tomas into two main groups. The IDH–wildtype mostly
corresponds to clinically defined primary or de novo glioblas-
toma and accounts for about 90% of cases. The remaining

10% are IDH–mutant cases, which usually arise in younger
patients and mostly correspond to secondary or promoted
lower–grade diffuse glioma [11, 21]. Figures 3(a) and 3(b)
support the conclusion of Ohgaki and Kleihues [11] that
promoted (secondary) tumours mainly occur in younger
people and that de novo GBMs dominate in the over-54 age
group. It is important that this pattern is monitored using
modern genetic techniques.
GBM tumours are almost always fatal and are not likely
to have been undiagnosed in the time-frame of our data. It
is possible that some elderly cases were not fully classified,

but then they should have been recorded as ICD10–D43.
However, as D43 rates have remained very constant over this
time period (see Figure 1), this is unlikely to have been a
significant confounder.
4.1. Possible Causal Factors. We cite examples of some
possible causal factors that have been discussed in the
literature that could contribute changes in GBM incidence.
In an important 2014 “state of science” review of glioma
epidemiology, Ostrom et al. [22] list and discuss a number
of potential factors that have been associated with glioma
incidence, some of which we list below.
Ionising radiation, especially from X-rays used in CT
scans, has the most supportive evidence as a causal factor.
Due to the easy availability of CT imaging and relative lack
and higher cost of MRI imaging in UK NHS hospitals, CT
scans are often used, especially for initial investigations. Their
use over the period 1995-2013 is shown in the Supplementary
File [S6]. Given the time-frame of the trend that we have
identified, we suggest that CT imaging X-ray exposures
should be further investigated for both the promotion and
initiation of the rising incidence of GBM tumours that we
have identified.
Preston et al. (2007) [23] concluded that radiation–
associated cancer persists throughout life regardless of age
at exposure and that glioma incidence shows a statistically
significant dose response. Our oldest age group also expe-
rienced atmospheric atomic bomb testing fallout and some
association with ingested and inhaled radionuclides should
not be dismissed as a possible factor. England was in one of
the highest exposed regions for atmospheric testing fallout
as determined by the United Nations Scientific Committee
on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, UNSCEAR 2000 Report
[24]. Further information is given in Supplementary File S7.
If only some of the population were susceptible and received
a significant dose, any resulting extra cancers would show up
in the ONS data.
The European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects
by Andersen et al. (2017) [25] found suggestive evidence
of an association between traffic-related air pollution and
malignant brain tumours.
There is increasing evidence literature that many cancers
including glioma have a metabolic driver due to mitochon-
drial dysfunction resulting in downstream genetic changes in
the nucleus [26–28].
The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) judged both power–frequency ELF (2002) [29] and
radio–frequency RF (2011) [30] electromagnetic fields as
Group 2B ‘possible human carcinogens’
. Villeneuve et al.
(2002) [31] concluded that occupational (ELF) magnetic field
exposure increases the risk of GBM with an OR = 5.36
(95% CI: 1.2 – 24.8). Hardell and Carlberg (2015) [32] have
reported an increase in high–grade glioma associated with
mobile phone use. The multi-country Interphone study [33]
collected data from 2000 to 2003 and included few people
over 55 years of age and would have been unable to resolve
any association involving older–aged people. Volkow et al.
(2011) [34] found that, in healthy participants and compared
with no exposure, a 50-minute cell phone exposure produced
a statistically significant increase in brain glucose metabolism
in the orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole regions closest
to the handset.
5. Conclusions
(1) We show a linear, large and highly statistically signifi-
cant increase in primary GBM tumours over 21 years
from 1995–2015, especially in frontal and temporal
lobes of the brain. This has aetiological and resource
implications.
(2) Although most of the cases are in the group over
54 years of age, the age–standardised AAPC rise is
strongly statistically significant in all our three main
analysis age groups.
(3) The rise in age–standardised incidence cannot be fully
accounted for by improved diagnosis, as it affects
specific areas of the brain and just one type of
brain tumour that is generally fatal. We suggest that
widespread environmental or lifestyle factors may be
responsible, although these results do not provide
additional evidence for the role of any particular risk
factor.
(4) Our results highlight an urgent need for funding more
research into the initiation and promotion of GBM
tumours. This should include the use of CT imaging
for diagnosis and also modern lifestyle factors that
may affect tumour metabolism.
Data Availability
The data were obtained from the UK Office for National
Statistics (ONS), who are the legal owners of the data. Some
data are publicly available in the ONS annual MB1 data series,
which are freely downloadable from the ONS website, but this
article uses the latest updated data, plus ICD–O–3 morphol-
ogy codes, extracted under personal researcher contract from
the ONS database in July 2017. ONS Data Guardian approval
was required for the supply, control and use of the data. A
nominal charge is made by the ONS for such data extraction.
We are not permitted to supply the raw ONS extracted data
to anyone else. Other researchers can obtain the latest data
directly from the ONS in a similar manner. The authors
provide some extra tables and figures in the Supplementary
File downloadable from the journal website.
