 2008 Physician Quality Reporting Initiative 
Specifications Document  
 
This document contains the complete specifications for the 119 measures that make up the 2008 Physician 
Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI). Each measure is assigned a unique number.  Measure numbers for 2008 
PQRI represent a continuation in numbering from the 2007 PQRI Measures 1 through 74.  Gaps in measure 
numbering reflect those 2007 PQRI measures that are not included for implementation in 2008 PQRI. In 
general, the quality measures consist of a numerator and a denominator that permit the calculation of the 
percentage of a defined patient population that receive a particular process of care or achieve a particular 
outcome. These specifications will be updated prior to the beginning of the 2008 PQRI reporting period to reflect 
any additional edits. 
 
The denominator population is defined by certain ICD-9 and CPT Category I codes specified in the measure 
that are submitted by eligible professionals as part of a claim for covered services under the Medicare Physician 
Fee Schedule. Some measure coding specifications are adapted as needed for implementation in PQRI in 
agreement with the measure developer. For example, CPT codes for non-covered services such as preventive 
visits are not included in the denominator. If the specified denominator codes for a measure are not included in 
the patient’s claim as submitted, then the patient does not fall into the denominator population, and the PQRI 
measure does not apply to the patient.   
 
If the patient does fall into the denominator population, the applicable CPT Category II code (or temporary G-
code, where CPT Category II codes are not yet available) that defines the numerator should be submitted.  
 
Where a patient falls in the denominator population but specifications define circumstances in which a patient 
may be excluded from the measure’s denominator population, CPT Category II code modifiers such as 1P, 2P, 
or 3P are available to describe medical, patient, system, or other reasons for such exclusion. Where the 
performance exclusion does not apply, a measure-specific CPT Category II modifier 8P or HCPCS G-code may 
be used to indicate that the process of care was not provided for a reason not otherwise specified. 
  
To successfully report quality data for a measure under the PQRI program, it is necessary in all circumstances 
to report numerator coding (CPT Category II code and/or G-code), with or without an applicable CPT Category II 
code modifier (1P, 2P, 3P, or 8P). Instructions specific to each measure provide additional reporting information.  
 
Instructions for some measures limit the frequency of reporting necessary in certain circumstances, such as for 
patients with chronic illness for whom a particular process of care is provided only periodically.

Measure #1: Hemoglobin A1c Poor Control in Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 18 through 75 years with diabetes mellitus who had most recent 
hemoglobin A1c greater than 9.0%  
 
INSTRUCTIONS:  
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients with diabetes 
mellitus seen during the reporting period. The performance period for this measure is 12 months. 
The most recent quality code submitted will be used for performance calculation. This measure 
may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on 
the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes:  
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, G-codes, and patient demographics (age, gender, 
etc.) are used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II 
codes are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes or 
G-codes, and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the 
modifier. The reporting modifier allowed for this measure is: 8P- reasons not otherwise specified.  
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients with most recent hemoglobin A1c level > 9.0% 
 
Numerator Instructions: This is a poor control measure. A lower rate indicates better 
performance (e.g., low rates of poor control indicate better care) 
 
Numerator Coding: 
Most Recent Hemoglobin A1c Level > 9.0% 
 
CPT II 3046F: Most recent hemoglobin A1c level > 9.0%  
OR  
If patient is not eligible for this measure because hemoglobin A1c not performed, 
report: 
Hemoglobin A1c not Performed 
Append a reporting modifier (8P) to CPT Category II code 3046F to report circumstances 
when the patient is not eligible for the measure. 
• 8P: Hemoglobin A1c level was not performed during the performance period (12 
months) 
OR

RATIONALE: 
Intensive therapy of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) reduces the risk of microvascular 
complications.
  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
A glycosylated hemoglobin should be performed during an initial assessment and during follow-up 
assessments, which should occur at no longer than three-month intervals.
 (AACE/ACE) 
 
The A1c should be universally adopted as the primary method of assessment of glycemic control. 
On the basis of data from multiple interventional trials, the target for attainment of glycemic control 
should be A1c values ≤6.5%. (AACE/ACE) 
 
Obtain a glycosylated hemoglobin during an initial assessment and then routinely as part of 
continuing care. In the absence of well-controlled studies that suggest a definite testing protocol, 
expert opinion recommends glycosylated hemoglobin be obtained at least twice a year in patients 
who are meeting treatment goals and who have stable glycemic control and more frequently 
(quarterly assessment) in patients whose therapy was changed or who are not meeting glycemic 
goals. (Level of evidence: E)
 (ADA) 
 
Because different assays can give varying glycated hemoglobin values, the ADA recommends that 
laboratories only use assay methods that are certified as traceable to the Diabetes Control and 
Complications Trial A1c reference method. The ADA’s goal for glycemic control is A1c <7%. (Level 
of evidence: B) (ADA) 
 
Monitor and treat hyperglycemia, with a target A1c of 7%, but less stringent goals for therapy may 
be appropriate once patient preferences, diabetes severity, life expectancy and functional status 
have been considered. (AGS)

RATIONALE: 
Persons with diabetes are at increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Lowering serum 
cholesterol levels can reduce the risk for CHD events.
  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
A fasting lipid profile should be obtained during an initial assessment, each follow-up assessment, 
and annually as part of the cardiac-cerebrovascular-peripheral vascular module. (AACE/ACE) 
 
A fasting lipid profile should be obtained as part of an initial assessment. Adult patients with 
diabetes should be tested annually for lipid disorders with fasting serum cholesterol, triglycerides, 
HDL cholesterol, and calculated LDL cholesterol measurements. If values fall in lower-risk levels, 
assessments may be repeated every two years. (Level of evidence: E)
 (ADA) 
 
Patients who do not achieve lipid goals with lifestyle modifications require pharmacological therapy. 
Lowering LDL cholesterol with a statin is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events. 
(Level of evidence: A)  
 
Lipid-lowering therapy should be used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and 
morbidity for all patients with known coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. (ACP) 
 
Statins should be used for primary prevention against macrovascular complications in patients with 
type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors.  
 
Once lipid-lowering therapy is initiated, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be taking at 
least moderate doses of a statin.
 
 
Older persons with diabetes are likely to benefit greatly from cardiovascular risk reduction, 
therefore monitor and treat hypertension and dyslipidemias. (AGS)

Measure #3: High Blood Pressure Control in Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
 
DESCRIPTION:  
Percentage of patients aged 18 through 75 years with diabetes mellitus who had most recent blood 
pressure in control (less than 140/80 mmHg) 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:  
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients with diabetes 
mellitus seen during the reporting period. The performance period for this measure is 12 months. 
The most recent quality code submitted will be used for performance calculation. This measure 
may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on 
the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes:

RATIONALE:  
Intensive control of blood pressure in patients with diabetes reduces diabetes complications, 
diabetes-related deaths, strokes, heart failure, and microvascular complications. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Recommends that a blood pressure determination during the initial evaluation, including orthostatic 
evaluation, be included in the initial and every interim physical examination. (AACE/ACE) 
 
Blood pressure control must be a priority in the management of persons with hypertension and 
type 2 diabetes. (ACP) 
 
Blood pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit. Patients found to have systolic 
blood pressure >130 mmHg or diastolic >80 mmHg should have blood pressure confirmed on a 
separate day. Orthostatic measurement of blood pressure should be performed to assess for the 
presence of autonomic neuropathy. (Level of Evidence: E)

Measurement of blood pressure in the standing position is indicated periodically, especially in 
those at risk for postural hypotension. At least two measurements should be made and the average 
recorded. After BP is at goal and stable, follow-up visits can usually be at 3- to 6-month intervals. 
Comorbidities such as heart failure, associated diseases such as diabetes, and the need for 
laboratory tests influence the frequency of visits. (JNC) 
 
All individuals should be evaluated during health encounters to determine whether they are at 
increased risk of having or of developing chronic kidney disease. This evaluation of risk factors 
should include blood pressure measurement. (NKF)

RATIONALE: 
Patients may not volunteer information regarding falls.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
All older persons who are under the care of a health professional (or their caregivers) should be 
asked at least once a year about falls. (AGS/BGS/AAOS) 
 
Older persons who present for medical attention because of a fall, report recurrent falls in the past 
year, or demonstrate abnormalities of gait and/or balance should have a fall evaluation performed. 
This evaluation should be performed by a clinician with appropriate skills and experience, which 
may necessitate referral to a specialist (e.g., geriatrician). (AGS/BGS/AAOS) 
 
Older people in contact with health care professionals should be asked routinely whether they have 
fallen in the past year and asked about the frequency, context and characteristics of the falls. 
(NICE) (Grade C) 
 
Older people reporting a fall or considered at risk of falling should be observed for balance and gait 
deficits and considered for their ability to benefit from interventions to improve strength and 
balance. (NICE) (Grade C)

systolic dysfunction (LVSD) who were prescribed ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:  
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for all heart failure patients 
seen during the reporting period. This measure is intended to reflect the quality of services 
provided for patients with heart failure and decreased left ventricular systolic function. The left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction may be determined by quantitative or qualitative assessment, which 
may be current or historical. Examples of a quantitative or qualitative assessment may include an 
echocardiogram: 1) that provides a numerical value of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or 2) that 
uses descriptive terms such as moderately or severely depressed left ventricular dysfunction. This 
measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure 
based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are 
used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes 
are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, 
and the appropriate CPT Category II code(s) OR the CPT Category II code(s) with the modifier. 
The modifiers allowed for this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 2P- patient reasons, 3P- system 
reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified.

RATIONALE: 
Oral antiplatelet therapy, preferably aspirin unless contraindicated, is recommended for all patients 
with coronary artery disease. By limiting the ability of clots to form in the arteries, antiplatelet 
agents have proven benefits in reducing the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke 
and death. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Chronic Stable Angina: Class I – Aspirin 75-325 mg daily should be used routinely in all patients 
with acute and chronic ischemic heart disease with or without manifest symptoms in the absence of 
contraindications. Class IIa – Clopidogrel is recommended when aspirin is absolutely 
contraindicated. Class III – Dipyridamole. Because even the usual oral doses of dipyridamole can 
 
 
12/31/2007  
15
  
 
enhance exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with stable angina, it should not be 
used as an antiplatelet agent. (ACC/AHA/ACP-ASIM) 
 
Unstable Angina and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Class I – Aspirin 75 to 325 
mg/dl in the absence of contraindications. Class I – Clopidogrel 75 qd for patients with a 
contraindication to ASA. (ACC/AHA) 
 
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): Class I – A dose of aspirin, 160 to 325 mg, should be given on 
day one of AMI and continued indefinitely on a daily basis thereafter. Trials suggest long-term use 
of aspirin in the postinfarction patient in a dose as low as 75 mg per day can be effective, with the 
likelihood that side effects can be reduced. Class IIb – Other antiplatelet agents such as 
dipyridamole, ticlopidine or clopidogrel may be substituted if true aspirin allergy is present or if the 
patient is unresponsive to aspirin. (ACC/AHA) 
 
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery: Aspirin is the drug of choice for prophylaxis against early 
saphenous graft thrombotic closure and should be considered a standard of care for the first 
postoperative year. In general, patients are continued on aspirin indefinitely, given its benefit in the 
secondary prevention of AMI. Ticlopidine is efficacious but offers no advantage over aspirin except 
as an alternative in the truly aspirin-allergic patient. Clopidogrel offers the potential of fewer side 
effects compared with ticlopidine as an alternative to aspirin for platelet inhibition. Indobufen 
appears to be as effective as aspirin for saphenous graft patency over the first postoperative year 
but with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Current evidence suggests that dipyridamole adds 
nothing to the aspirin effect for saphenous graft patency. (ACC/AHA)

recurrent MI and decrease mortality for those patients with a prior MI.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS:  
Chronic Stable Angina: Class I – Beta-blockers as initial therapy in the absence of 
contraindications in patients with prior MI. Class I – Beta-blockers as initial therapy in the absence 
of contraindications in patients without prior MI. (ACC/AHA/ACP-ASIM) 
 
Unstable Angina and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Class I – Drugs required in 
the hospital to control ischemia should be continued after hospital discharge in patients who do not

undergo coronary revascularization, patients with unsuccessful revascularization, or patients with 
recurrent symptoms after revascularization. Upward or downward titration of the doses may be 
required. Class I – Beta-blockers in the absence of contraindications. (ACC/AHA) 
 
Acute Myocardial Infarction: Class I – All but low-risk patients without a clear contraindication to ß-
adrenoceptor blocker therapy. Treatment should begin within a few days of the event (if not 
initiated acutely) and continue indefinitely. Class IIa – Low-risk patients without a clear 
contraindication to ß-adrenoceptor blocker therapy. Survivors of non-ST-elevation MI. Class IIb – 
Patients with moderate or severe LV failure or other relative contraindications to ß-adrenoceptor 
blocker therapy, provided they can be monitored closely. (ACC/AHA) 
 
Although no study has determined if long-term ß-adrenoceptor blocker therapy should be 
administered to survivors of MI who subsequently have successfully undergone revascularization, 
there is no reason to believe that these agents act differently in coronary patients who have 
undergone revascularization. (ACC/AHA)

RATIONALE: 
The consequences of untreated, or inadequately treated, depression are significant; therefore, 
adherence to antidepressant medication is very important. Clinical guidelines for depression stress 
the importance of effective clinical management in increasing patients’ medication compliance, 
monitoring treatment effectiveness, and identifying and managing side effects. If pharmacological 
treatment is initiated, appropriate dosing and continuation of therapy through the acute and 
continuation phases decreases recurrence of depression. Thus, evaluation of length of treatment 
serves as an important indicator of success in promoting patient compliance with the establishment 
and maintenance of an effective medication regimen. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Successful treatment of patients with major depressive disorder is promoted by a thorough 
assessment of the patient and close adherence to treatment plans. Treatment consists of an acute 
phase, during which remission is induced; a continuation phase, during which remission is 
preserved; and a maintenance phase, during which the susceptible patient is protected against the 
recurrence of a subsequent major depressive episode. Patients who have been treated with 
antidepressant medications in the acute phase should be maintained on these agents to prevent 
relapse. American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients 
with Major Depressive Disorder, 2000 
 
Antidepressants should be continued for at least 6 months after remission of an episode of 
depression, because this greatly reduces the risk of relapse. (A: At least one randomized controlled 
trial as part of a body of literature of overall good quality and consistency addressing the specific 
recommendation (evidence level-I) without extrapolation) National Institute for Clinical Excellence 
(UK), Management of Depression in Primary and Secondary Care, 2004 
 
In recent years, major depression has come to be considered a chronic and/or recurrent, rather 
than an acute illness. This reevaluation of the disorder has inherent treatment implications because 
patients with major depression tend to exhibit episodic recurrence and/or chronic residual

symptoms. Considering this, the management of depression can be divided into the acute phase 
(suppression of symptoms to achieve clinical remission), lasting 8 to 12 weeks, and the 
maintenance phase (prevention of relapse/recurrence), lasting 6 months or longer. Clinical 
management is an important component of pharmacotherapy; and includes a brief session of 
psychoeducation and supportive strategies. During the maintenance phase after remission of acute 
symptoms, all patients should continue the antidepressant dose that induced remission for at least 
6 months. The relapse rate is 35% to 60% if antidepressants are discontinued in the first 6 months, 
compared with 10% to 25% in patients who continue medications. The risk of relapse is particularly 
high if drug discontinuation occurs in the first few months of response/remission. Canadian

RATIONALE: 
The CT and MRI findings are critical to initiating care for the patient with stroke. All CT and MRI 
reports should address the presence or absence of these three important findings. This 
documentation is particularly vital in the report of the first imaging study performed after arrival at 
the hospital, on which initial treatment decisions will be based.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Brain imaging is required to guide acute intervention. (Grade A) There is a uniform agreement that 
CT accurately identifies most cases of intracranial hemorrhage and helps discriminate nonvascular 
causes of neurological symptoms, e.g., brain tumor. (Grade B) With the advent of rtPA treatment, 
interest has grown in using CT to identify subtle, early signs of ischemic brain injury (early infarct 
signs) or arterial occlusion that might affect decisions about treatment. The presence of these signs 
is associated with poor outcomes. (Adams, ASA, 2003) (Class A)  
 
A technically adequate head CT scan is required prior to administration of thrombolytic therapy to 
exclude brain hemorrhage and nonischemic diagnoses. The baseline CT scan is also sensitive for 
detection of early signs of cerebral infarction. Subtle or limited signs of early infarction on the CT 
scan are common even within the first 3 h of stroke evolution. 
 
Preliminary data suggest that specific MRI profiles may identify patients who are particularly likely 
to benefit from thrombolytic therapy. New MRI techniques including perfusion-weighted and 
diffusion-weighted may detect ischemic injury in the first hour and may reveal the extent of 
reversible and irreversible injury. In addition, MRI appears to be highly sensitive for identification of 
acute brain hemorrhage. (Albers, ACCP, 2004)

Measure #11: Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation: Carotid Imaging Reports 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of final reports for carotid imaging studies (neck MR angiography [MRA], neck CT 
angiography [CTA], neck duplex ultrasound, carotid angiogram) performed for patients aged 18 
years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) that include 
direct or indirect reference to measurements of distal internal carotid diameter as the denominator 
for stenosis measurement 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported each time a carotid imaging study is performed during the reporting 
period for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA. It is anticipated that clinicians who 
provide the physician component of diagnostic imaging studies for patients with stroke or TIA in the 
hospital or outpatient setting will submit this measure. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT procedure codes, and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are 
used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes 
are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT procedure codes, and 
the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The 
modifiers allowed for this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Final carotid imaging study reports that include direct or indirect reference to measurements of 
distal internal carotid diameter as the denominator for stenosis measurement 
 
Definition: “Direct or indirect reference to measurements of distal internal carotid diameter 
as the denominator for stenosis measurement” includes direct angiographic stenosis 
calculation based on the distal lumen as the denominator for stenosis measurement OR an 
equivalent validated method referenced to the above method (e.g., for duplex ultrasound 
studies, velocity parameters that correlate the residual internal carotid lumen with methods 
based on the distal internal carotid lumen) 
 
Numerator Coding:  
Reference to Measurements of Distal Internal Carotid Diameter as the Denominator 
for Stenosis Measurement Documented 
CPT II 3100F: Carotid image study report includes direct or indirect reference to 
measurements of distal internal carotid diameter as the denominator for stenosis 
measurement 
OR

Measurements of Distal Internal Carotid Diameter not Referenced for Medical 
Reasons 
Append a modifier (1P) to CPT Category II code 3100F to report documented 
circumstances that appropriately exclude patients from the denominator. 
• 1P: Documentation of medical reason(s) for not including direct or indirect reference to 
measurements of distal internal carotid diameter  
OR 
Measurements of Distal Internal Carotid Diameter not Referenced, Reason not 
Specified 
Append a reporting modifier (8P) to CPT Category II code 3100F to report circumstances 
when the action described in the numerator is not performed and the reason is not 
otherwise specified.  
• 8P: Carotid image study report did not include direct or indirect reference to 
measurements of distal internal carotid diameter as the denominator for stenosis 
measurement, reason not otherwise specified 
 
DENOMINATOR: 
All final reports for carotid imaging studies (neck MR angiography [MRA], neck CT angiography 
[CTA], neck duplex ultrasound, carotid angiogram) performed for patients aged 18 years and older 
with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA 
 
Denominator Coding:  
An ICD-9 diagnosis code for ischemic stroke or TIA and a CPT procedure code for patients 
undergoing carotid imaging are required to identify patients for denominator inclusion. 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes: 433.01, 433.11, 433.21, 433.31, 433.81, 433.91, 434.01, 434.11, 
434.91, 435.0, 435.1, 435.2, 435.3, 435.8, 435.9  
AND  
CPT procedure codes: 70498, 70547, 70548, 70549, 75660, 75662, 75665, 75671, 
75676, 75680, 93880, 93882  
 
RATIONALE: 
Since the clinical decision-making is based on randomized trial evidence and degree of stenosis is 
an important element of the decision for carotid intervention, characterization of the degree of 
stenosis needs to be standardized. Requiring that stenosis calculation be based on a denominator 
of distal internal carotid diameter or, in the case of duplex ultrasound, velocity measurements that 
have been correlated to angiographic stenosis calculation based on distal internal carotid diameter, 
makes the measure applicable to both imaging and duplex studies. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS:  
For patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis > 70%, as defined using the 
NASCET criteria, the value of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been clearly established from the 
results of 3 major prospective randomized trials: the NASCET, the European Carotid Surgery Trial 
(ECST), and the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Program. Among symptomatic patients with 
TIAs or minor strokes and high-grade carotid stenosis, each trial showed impressive relative and 
absolute risk reductions for those randomized to surgery. For patients with carotid stenosis < 50%, 
these trials showed that there was no significant benefit of surgery. (Sacco, ASA, 2006) 
 
 
12/31/2007

It is important to consider that the degree of carotid stenosis in ECST was measured differently 
than that in NASCET. The degree of carotid stenosis is significantly higher if calculated by the 
NASCET rather than the ECST method. In summary, it appears that patients with a recent TIA or 
nondisabling stroke with ipsilateral carotid stenosis benefit from surgery if the stenosis is > 50% as 
measured by the NASCET method; however, this benefit appears to be less pronounced in 
women. Recently symptomatic patients with > 70% stenosis as measured by the NASCET method 
can expect a far greater benefit from carotid endarterectomy. (Albers, AHA, 1999)

RATIONALE: 
Changes in the optic nerve are one of two characteristics which currently define progression and 
thus worsening of glaucoma disease status (the other characteristic is visual field). There is a 
significant gap in documentation patterns of the optic nerve for both initial and follow-up care 
(Fremont, 2003), even among specialists (Lee, 2006). Examination of the optic nerve head and 
retinal nerve fiber layer provides valuable structural information about glaucomatous optic nerve 
damage. Visible structural alterations of the optic nerve head or retinal nerve fiber layer and 
development of peripapillary choroidal atrophy frequently occur before visual field defects can be 
detected.{ ADDIN EN.CITE

hemorrhages is important, since these hemorrhages can precede visual field loss and further optic 
nerve damage. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The physical exam focuses on nine elements: visual acuity, pupils, slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the 
anterior segment, measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), determination of central corneal 
thickness, gonioscopy, evaluation of optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer, documentation 
of optic nerve head appearance, evaluation of fundus (through dilated pupil), and evaluation of the 
visual field (Level A: II Recommendation for optic nerve head evaluation) (AAO, 2005).

RATIONALE: 
A documented complete macular examination is a necessary prerequisite to determine the 
presence and severity of AMD, so that a decision can be made as to the benefits of prescribing 
antioxidant vitamins. Further, periodic assessment is necessary to determine whether there is 
progression of the disease and to plan the on-going treatment of the disease, since several 
therapies exist that reduce vision loss once the advanced “wet” form of AMD occurs. While no data 
exist on the frequency or absence of regular examinations of the macula for patients with AMD, 
parallel data for key structural assessments for glaucoma and cataract and diabetic retinopathy 
suggest that significant gaps are likely.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, a stereo biomicroscopic examination of the 
macula should be completed. Binocular slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the ocular fundus is often 
necessary to detect subtle clinical clues of CNV. These include small areas of hemorrhage, hard 
exudates, subretinal fluid, or pigment epithelial elevation (Level A: III Recommendation) (AAO, 
2005).

INSTRUCTIONS:  
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients seen during the 
reporting period. It is anticipated that clinicians who provide the primary management of patients 
with diabetic retinopathy (in either one or both eyes) will submit this measure. The system reason 
exclusion may be used if a clinician is asked to report on this measure but is not the clinician 
providing the primary management for diabetic retinopathy.

RATIONALE: 
Several level 1 RCT studies demonstrate the ability of timely treatment to reduce the rate and 
severity of vision loss from diabetes (Diabetic Retinopathy Study - DRS, Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study - ETDRS). Necessary examination prerequisites to applying the study results 
are that the presence and severity of both peripheral diabetic retinopathy and macular edema be 
accurately documented. In the RAND chronic disease quality project, while administrative data 
indicated that roughly half of the patients had an eye exam in the recommended time period, chart 
review data indicated that only 19% had documented evidence of a dilated examination. (McGlynn, 
2003). Thus, ensuring timely treatment that could prevent 95% of the blindness due to diabetes 
requires the performance and documentation of key examination parameters. The documented 
level of severity of retinopathy and the documented presence or absence of macular edema assists 
with the on-going plan of care for the patient with diabetic retinopathy.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Since treatment is effective in reducing the risk of visual loss, detailed examination is indicated to 
assess for the following features that often lead to visual impairment: presence of macular edema, 
optic nerve neovascularization and/or neovascularization elsewhere, signs of severe NPDR and 
vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage. (Level A:III Recommendation) (AAO, 2003)

RATIONALE: 
The physician that manages the ongoing care of the patient with diabetes should be aware of the 
patient’s dilated eye examination and severity of retinopathy to manage the on-going diabetes 
care. Such communication is important in assisting the physician to better manage the diabetes. 
Several studies have shown that better management of diabetes is directly related to lower rates of 
development of diabetic eye disease. (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial - DCCT, UK 
Prospective Diabetes Study - UKPDS)  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
While it is clearly the responsibility of the ophthalmologist to manage eye disease, it is also the 
ophthalmologist’s responsibility to ensure that patients with diabetes are referred for appropriate 
management of their systemic condition. It is the realm of the patient’s family physician, internist or 
endocrinologist to manage the systemic diabetes. The ophthalmologist should communicate with 
the attending physician. (Level A: III Recommendation) (AAO, 2003)

Measure #20: Perioperative Care: Timing of Antibiotic Prophylaxis – Ordering Physician 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of surgical patients aged 18 years and older undergoing procedures with the 
indications for prophylactic parenteral antibiotics, who have an order for prophylactic antibiotic to 
be given within one hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours), prior to the surgical incision 
(or start of procedure when no incision is required)  
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported each time a procedure is performed during the reporting period for 
patients who undergo surgical procedures with the indications for prophylactic antibiotics. There is 
no diagnosis associated with this measure. It is anticipated that clinicians who perform the listed 
surgical procedures as specified in the denominator coding will submit this measure.  
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
CPT procedure codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the 
numerator of the measure. If multiple surgical procedures were performed on the same date of 
service and submitted on the same claim form, it is not necessary for the same clinician to submit 
the CPT Category II code with each procedure. However, if multiple NPIs are reporting this 
measure on the same claim, each NPI should report the quality-data code. 
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed CPT procedure code and the appropriate CPT 
Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The modifiers allowed for this 
measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Surgical patients who have an order for prophylactic antibiotic to be given within one hour (if 
fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to the surgical incision (or start of procedure when 
no incision is required)

order, or standing order/protocol) specifying that antibiotic is to be given within one hour (if 
fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to the surgical incision (or start of 
procedure when no incision is required) OR documentation that antibiotic has been given 
within one hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to the surgical incision 
(or start of procedure when no incision is required). 
Note: In the event surgery is delayed, as long as the patient is redosed (if clinically 
appropriate) the numerator coding should be applied.

RATIONALE: 
The appropriate timing of administration of prophylactic antibiotics has been demonstrated to 
reduce the incidence of surgical wound infections. Specifying the time of administration in the order 
is critical as available evidence suggests that the drug should be received within one hour before 
incision for maximum antimicrobial effect.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The anti-infective drug should ideally be given within 30 minutes to 1 hour before the initial incision 
to ensure its presence in an adequate concentration in the targeted tissues. For most procedures, 
scheduling administration at the time of induction of anesthesia ensures adequate concentrations 
during the period of potential contamination. Exceptions: cesarean procedures (after cross 
clamping of the umbilical cord); colonic procedures (starting 19 hours before the scheduled time of 
surgery). (ASHP) 
 
Infusion of the first antimicrobial dose should begin within 60 minutes before incision. However, 
when a fluoroquinolone or vancomycin is indicated, the infusion should begin within 120 minutes 
before incision to prevent antibiotic-associated reactions. Although research has demonstrated that 
administration of the antimicrobial at the time of anesthesia induction is safe and results in adequate 
serum and tissue drug levels at the time of incision, there was no consensus that the infusion must 
be completed before incision. (SIPGWW)

Measure #21: Perioperative Care: Selection of Prophylactic Antibiotic – First OR Second 
Generation Cephalosporin 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of surgical patients aged 18 years and older undergoing procedures with the 
indications for a first OR second generation cephalosporin prophylactic antibiotic, who had an order 
for cefazolin OR cefuroxime for antimicrobial prophylaxis 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported each time a procedure is performed during the reporting period for 
patients who undergo surgical procedures with the indications for a first or second generation 
cephalosporin prophylactic antibiotic. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. It is 
anticipated that clinicians who perform the listed surgical procedures as specified in the 
denominator coding will submit this measure. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
CPT procedure codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the 
numerator of the measure. If multiple surgical procedures were performed on the same date of 
service and submitted on the same claim form, it is not necessary for the same clinician to submit 
the CPT Category II code with each procedure. However, if multiple NPIs are reporting this 
measure on the same claim, each NPI should report the quality-data code. 
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed CPT procedure codes and the appropriate CPT 
Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The modifiers allowed for this 
measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Surgical patients who had an order for cefazolin OR cefuroxime for antimicrobial prophylaxis 
 
Numerator Instructions: There must be documentation of order (written order, verbal 
order, or standing order/protocol) for cefazolin or cefuroxime for antimicrobial prophylaxis 
OR documentation that cefazolin or cefuroxime was given. 
Note: In the event surgery is delayed, as long as the patient is redosed (if clinically 
appropriate) the numerator coding should be applied. 
 
Numerator Coding:  
 
Acceptable First and Second Generation Cephalosporin Prophylactic Antibiotics 
First generation cephalosporin: cefazolin 
Second generation cephalosporin: cefuroxime

Documentation of order for cefazolin OR cefuroxime for antimicrobial prophylaxis 
(written order, verbal order, or standing order/protocol)  
CPT II 4041F: Documentation of order for cefazolin OR cefuroxime for antimicrobial 
prophylaxis  
Note: CPT Category II code 4041F is provided for antibiotic ordered or antibiotic given. 
Report CPT Category II code 4041F if cefazolin OR cefuroxime was given for antimicrobial 
prophylaxis. 
OR 
Order for First or Second Generation Cephalosporin not Ordered for Medical 
Reasons 
Append a modifier (1P) to CPT Category II code 4041F to report documented 
circumstances that appropriately exclude patients from the denominator. 
• 1P: Documentation of medical reason(s) for not ordering cefazolin OR cefuroxime for 
antimicrobial prophylaxis 
OR 
Order for First or Second Generation Cephalosporin not Ordered, Reason not 
Specified 
Append a reporting modifier (8P) to CPT Category II code 4041F to report circumstances 
when the action described in the numerator is not performed and the reason is not 
otherwise specified.  
• 8P: Order for cefazolin OR cefuroxime for antimicrobial prophylaxis was not 
documented, reason not otherwise specified 
 
DENOMINATOR: 
All surgical patients aged 18 years and older undergoing procedures with the indications for a first 
or second generation cephalosporin prophylactic antibiotic  
 
Denominator Coding:  
A CPT procedure code for surgical procedures with indications for first or second 
generation cephalosporin prophylactic antibiotic is required to identify patients for 
denominator inclusion.

RATIONALE: 
Current published evidence supports the use of either cefazolin, a first generation cephalosporin, 
or cefuroxime, a second generation cephalosporin, for many surgical procedures, in the absence of 
β-lactam allergy. An alternative antimicrobial regimen may be appropriate depending on the 
antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in an individual institution (potentially a medical reason for 
excluding patients treated at that institution from this measure.)  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
For most procedures, cefazolin should be the agent of choice because of its relatively long duration 
of action, its effectiveness against the organisms most commonly encountered in surgery, and its 
relatively low cost. (ASHP) 
 
In operations for which cephalosporins represent appropriate prophylaxis, alternative antimicrobials 
should be provided to those with a high likelihood of serious adverse reaction or allergy on the 
basis of patient history or diagnostic tests such as skin testing.

The preferred antimicrobials for prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty are 
cefazolin and cefuroxime. Vancomycin or clindamycin may be used in patients with serious allergy 
or adverse reactions to β-lactams. 
 
The recommended antimicrobials for cardiothoracic and vascular operations include cefazolin or 
cefuroxime. For patients with serious allergy or adverse reaction to β-lactams, vancomycin is 
appropriate, and clindamycin may be an acceptable alternative. (SIPGWW)

Measure #22: Perioperative Care: Discontinuation of Prophylactic Antibiotics (Non-
Cardiac Procedures) 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of non-cardiac surgical patients aged 18 years and older undergoing procedures with 
the indications for prophylactic antibiotics AND who received a prophylactic antibiotic, who have an 
order for discontinuation of prophylactic antibiotics within 24 hours of surgical end time 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported each time a procedure is performed during the reporting period for 
patients who undergo non-cardiac surgical procedures with the indications for prophylactic 
antibiotics. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. It is anticipated that clinicians who 
perform the listed surgical procedures as specified in the denominator coding will submit this 
measure. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
CPT procedure codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the numerator of 
the measure. If multiple surgical procedures were performed on the same date of service and 
submitted on the same claim form, it is not necessary for the same clinician to submit the CPT 
Category II code with each procedure. However, if multiple NPIs are reporting this measure on the 
same claim, each NPI should report the quality-data code. 
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed CPT procedure codes and the appropriate CPT 
Category II code(s) OR the CPT Category II code(s) with the modifier. The modifiers allowed for 
this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Non-cardiac surgical patients who have an order for discontinuation of prophylactic antibiotics 
within 24 hours of surgical end time 
 
Numerator Instructions: There must be documentation of order (written order, verbal 
order, or standing order/protocol) specifying that prophylactic antibiotic is to be 
discontinued within 24 hours of surgical end time OR specifying a course of antibiotic 
administration limited to that 24-hour period (e.g., “to be given every 8 hours for three 
doses”) OR documentation that prophylactic antibiotic was discontinued within 24 hours of 
surgical end time. 
 
NUMERATOR NOTE: The correct combination of numerator code(s) must be reported on 
the claim form in order to properly report this measure. The “correct combination” of codes 
may require the submission of multiple numerator codes.

Numerator Coding:  
Documentation of order for discontinuation of prophylactic antibiotics (written 
order, verbal order, or standing order/protocol) within 24 hours of surgical end time 
(Two CPT II codes [4049F & 4046F] are required on the claim form to submit this 
category) 
 
CPT II 4049F: Documentation that order was given to discontinue prophylactic antibiotics 
within 24 hours of surgical end time, non-cardiac procedure  
Note: CPT Category II code 4049F is provided for documentation that antibiotic 
discontinuation was ordered or that antibiotic discontinuation was accomplished. 
Report CPT Category II code 4049F if antibiotics were discontinued within 24 
hours.  
AND  
CPT II 4046F: Documentation that prophylactic antibiotics were given within 4 hours prior 
to surgical incision or given intraoperatively 
OR 
Prophylactic Antibiotics not Discontinued for Medical Reasons 
(Two CPT II codes [4049F-1P & 4046F] are required on the claim form to submit this 
category) 
 
Append a modifier (1P) to CPT Category II code 4049F to report documented 
circumstances that appropriately exclude patients from the denominator.  
• 4049F with 1P: Documentation of medical reason(s) for not discontinuing prophylactic 
antibiotics within 24 hours of surgical end time 
AND 
CPT II 4046F: Documentation that prophylactic antibiotics were given within 4 hours prior 
to surgical incision or given intraoperatively 
 
OR 
 
If patient is not eligible for this measure because patient did not receive 
prophylactic antibiotics within specified timeframe, report: 
(One CPT II code [4042F] is required on the claim form to submit this category) 
 
CPT II 4042F: Documentation that prophylactic antibiotics were neither given within 4 
hours prior to surgical incision nor given intraoperatively 
OR 
Prophylactic Antibiotics not Discontinued, Reason not Specified 
(Two CPT II codes [4049F-8P & 4046F] are required on the claim form to submit this 
category) 
 
Append a reporting modifier (8P) to CPT Category II code 4049F to report circumstances 
when the action described in the numerator is not performed and the reason is not 
otherwise specified.  
• 4049F with 8P: Order was not given to discontinue prophylactic antibiotics within 24 
hours of surgical end time, non-cardiac procedure, reason not otherwise specified 
 
 
12/31/2007  
55
  
 
AND 
CPT II 4046F: Documentation that prophylactic antibiotics were given within 4 hours prior 
to surgical incision or given intraoperatively 
 
DENOMINATOR: 
All non-cardiac surgical patients undergoing procedures with the indications for prophylactic 
antibiotics AND who received a prophylactic antibiotic. 
 
Denominator Instructions: For the purpose of this measure of antibiotic discontinuation, 
patients may be counted as having “received a prophylactic antibiotic” if the antibiotic was 
received within 4 hours prior to the surgical incision (or start of procedure when no incision 
is required) or intraoperatively.  
 
Denominator Coding:  
A CPT procedure code for non-cardiac surgical procedures for which prophylactic 
antibiotics are indicated is required to identify patients for denominator inclusion.

RATIONALE:  
There is no evidence there is added benefit of prolonged prophylactic antibiotic use. Prolonged use 
may increase antibiotic resistant organisms.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
At a minimum, antimicrobial coverage must be provided from the time of incision to closure of the 
incision. For most procedures, the duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis should be 24 hours or less, 
with the exception of cardiothoracic procedures (up to 72 hours’ duration) and ophthalmic 
procedures (duration not clearly established). (ASHP) 
 
Prophylactic antimicrobials should be discontinued within 24 hours after the operation. (SIPGWW)

RATIONALE: 
This measure addresses VTE risk based on surgical procedure. VTE prophylaxis is appropriate for 
all patients undergoing these procedures regardless of individual patient thromboembolic risk 
factors.  
 
Additional work is needed to determine if a physician-level measure for VTE prophylaxis can be 
developed to address individual patient thromboembolic risk factors, in addition to procedural risk, 
without creating data collection burden. Many of these procedures are done in hospitals and ASCs, 
but quite a few are performed in the physician's office. There are many reasons for the differences 
in the site of service, including that breast lesions and breast tissue varies considerably. Some 
women have a small breast and a small lesion that can be expeditiously treated as a minor office 
procedure done in 20 minutes under local anesthesia. In this instance, the evidence for DVT 
prophylaxis is simply not present. Other patients have small or large lesions located in difficult 
positions within a dense complex breast. In this instance, the patients have long procedures under 
general anesthesia. Both of these instances can occur within the same CPT code. It should be 
noted that the number of medical exclusions for these codes will likely be much higher than other 
codes to account for the variation in major and minor procedures within the same CPT code. 
Duration of VTE prophylaxis is not specified in the measure due to varying guideline 
recommendations for different patient populations.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Recommend that mechanical methods of prophylaxis be used primarily in patients who are at high 
risk of bleeding (Grade 1C+) or as an adjunct to anticoagulant-based prophylaxis (Grade 2A). 
 
Recommend against the use of aspirin alone as prophylaxis against VTE for any patient group 
(Grade 1A). 
 
Recommend consideration of renal impairment when deciding on doses of LMWH, fondaparinux, 
the direct thrombin inhibitors, and other antithrombotic drugs that are cleared by the kidneys, 
particularly in elderly patients and those who are at high risk for bleeding (Grade 1C+). 
Moderate-risk general surgery patients are those patients undergoing a nonmajor procedure and 
are between the ages of 40 and 60 years or have additional risk factors, or those patients who 
are undergoing major operations and are < 40 years of age with no additional risk factors. 
Recommend prophylaxis with LDUH, 5,000 U bid or LMWH <= 3,400 U once daily (both Grade 
1A). 
Higher-risk general surgery patients are those undergoing nonmajor surgery and are > 60 years of 
age or have additional risk factors, or patients undergoing major surgery who are > 40 years of 
age or have additional risk factors. Recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH, 5,000 U tid or 
LMWH, > 3,400 U daily (both Grade 1A). 
Recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all major gynecologic surgery patients (Grade 
1A). 
 
For patients undergoing major, open urologic procedures, recommend routine prophylaxis with 
LDUH twice daily or three times daily (Grade 1A). 
 
Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, which includes hip and knee arthroplasty and hip 
fracture repair, represent a group that is at particularly high risk for VTE, and routine 
thromboprophylaxis has been the standard of care for > 15 years. Elective total hip replacement: 
routine use of LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose VKA (all Grade 1A). Elective total knee 
arthroplasty: routine thromboprophylaxis using LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose VKA (all 
Grade 1A). Hip fracture surgery: routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1C+), 
adjusted-dose VKA (Grade 2B), or LDUH (Grade 1B). 
 
For major orthopedic surgical procedures, recommend that a decision about the timing of the 
initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis be based on the efficacy-to-bleeding tradeoffs for that 
particular agent (Grade 1A). For LMWH, there are only small differences between starting 
preoperatively or postoperatively, both options acceptable (Grade 1A). 
 
Recommend that thromboprophylaxis be routinely used in patients undergoing major neurosurgery 
(Grade 1A). (ACCP)

Measure #24: Osteoporosis: Communication with the Physician Managing Ongoing Care 
Post-Fracture  
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 50 years and older treated for a hip, spine, or distal radial fracture with 
documentation of communication with the physician managing the patient’s on-going care that a 
fracture occurred and that the patient was or should be tested or treated for osteoporosis 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported after each occurrence of a fracture during the reporting period. 
Patients with a fracture of the hip, spine, or distal radius should have documentation in the medical 
record of communication from the clinician treating the fracture to the clinician managing the 
patient’s on-going care that the fracture occurred and that the patient was or should be tested or 
treated for osteoporosis. If multiple fractures occurring on the same date of service are submitted 
on the same claim form, only one instance of reporting will be counted. Claims data will be 
analyzed to determine unique occurrences. Documentation must indicate that communication to 
the clinician managing the on-going care of the patient occurred within three months of treatment 
for the fracture. The CPT Category II code should be reported during the episode of care (e.g., 
treatment of the fracture). The reporting of the code and documentation of communication do not 
need to occur simultaneously. It is anticipated that clinicians who treat the hip, spine or distal radial 
fracture will submit this measure. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, CPT procedure codes, and patient demographics 
(age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. 
CPT Category II codes are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, 
CPT procedure codes, and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code 
with the modifier. The modifiers allowed for this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 2P- patient 
reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients with documentation of communication with the physician managing the patient’s on-going 
care that a fracture occurred and that the patient was or should be tested or treated for 
osteoporosis  
 
Definition: Communication may include: Documentation in the medical record indicating 
that the clinician treating the fracture communicated (e.g., verbally, by letter, DXA report 
was sent) with the clinician managing the patient’s on-going care OR a copy of a letter in 
the medical record outlining whether the patient was or should be treated for osteoporosis.

RATIONALE: 
Patients who experience fragility fractures should either be treated or screened for the presence of 
osteoporosis. Although the fracture may be treated by the orthopedic surgeon, the testing and/or 
treatment is likely to be under the responsibility of the physician providing on-going care. It is 
important the physician providing on-going care for the patient be made aware the patient has 
sustained a non-traumatic fracture. There is a high degree of variability and consensus by experts 
of what constitutes a fragility fracture and predictor of an underlying problem of osteoporosis. The 
work group determined that only those fractures, which have the strongest consensus and 
evidence that they are predictive of osteoporosis, should be included in the measure at this time. 
We anticipate that the list of fractures will expand as further evidence is published supporting the 
inclusion of other fractures.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The most important risk factors for osteoporosis-related fractures are a prior low-trauma fracture as 
an adult and a low BMD in patients with or without fractures. (AACE) 
 
BMD measurement should be performed in all women 40 years old or older who have sustained a 
fracture. (AACE) 
 
The decision to measure bone density should follow an individualized approach. It should be 
considered when it will help the patient decide whether to institute treatment to prevent 
osteoporotic fracture. It should also be considered in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for 2 
months or more and patients with other conditions that place them at high risk for osteoporotic 
fracture. (NIH)  
 
The most commonly used measurement to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fracture risk is 
based on assessment of BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). (NIH) Measurements of 
BMD made at the hip predict hip fracture better than measurements made at other sites while BMD 
measurement at the spine predicts spine fracture better than measures at other sites. (NIH) 
 
The single most powerful predictor of a future osteoporotic fracture is the presence of previous 
such fractures. (AGA)

Measure #28: Aspirin at Arrival for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 
 
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients, regardless of age, with an emergency department discharge diagnosis of 
AMI who had documentation of receiving aspirin within 24 hours before emergency department 
arrival or during emergency department stay 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported each time during the reporting period a patient has been discharged 
from the emergency department with a diagnosis of AMI. Patients who are discharged from the 
emergency department with a diagnosis of AMI should have documentation in the medical record 
of having received aspirin 24 hours before emergency department arrival or during emergency 
department stay. It is anticipated that clinicians who provide care in the emergency department will 
submit this measure. The Part B claim form place-of-service field must indicate that the encounter 
has taken place in the emergency department. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes:  
ICD-9 diagnosis codes and CPT E/M service codes are used to identify patients who are included 
in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the numerator of the 
measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, 
and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The 
modifiers allowed for this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 2P- patient reasons, 8P- reasons not 
otherwise specified.

Measure #30: Perioperative Care: Timing of Prophylactic Antibiotic – Administering 
Physician 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of surgical patients aged 18 and older who have an order for a parenteral antibiotic to 
be given within one hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to the surgical incision 
(or start of procedure when no incision is required) for whom administration of prophylactic 
antibiotic has been initiated within one hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to 
the surgical incision (or start of procedure when no incision is required) 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported each time a procedure is performed during the reporting period for 
patients who undergo surgical procedures with an order for prophylactic antibiotics. It is anticipated 
that clinicians who provide anesthesia care for surgical procedures with an order for prophylactic 
antibiotics will submit this measure.  
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
A CPT Category II code and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the measure’s denominator. Only CPT Category II codes are used to report 
this measure. 
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category 
II code with the modifier. The reporting modifier allowed for this measure is: 8P- reasons not 
otherwise specified. There are no allowable performance exclusions for this measure. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Surgical patients for whom administration of a prophylactic antibiotic has been initiated within one 
hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to the surgical incision (or start of 
procedure when no incision is required) 
 
Numerator Instructions: This measure seeks to identify the timely administration of 
prophylactic antibiotic. This administration should begin within one hour (if fluoroquinolone 
or vancomycin, two hours) prior to surgical incision.

when the action described in the numerator is not performed and the reason is not 
otherwise specified.  
• 8P: Prophylactic antibiotic was not given within one hour (if fluoroquinolone or

DENOMINATOR: 
All surgical patients aged 18 years and older who have an order for a parenteral antibiotic to be 
given within one hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to the surgical incision (or 
start of procedure when no incision is required) 
 
Denominator Instructions: For denominator inclusion, there must be documentation of 
order (written order, verbal order, or standing order/protocol) specifying that prophylactic 
parenteral antibiotic is to be given within one hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two 
hours) prior to the surgical incision (or start of procedure when no incision is required). 
 
 
Denominator Coding:  
A CPT Category II code for a parenteral antibiotic order is required to identify patients for 
denominator inclusion.  
CPT II 4047F: Documentation of order for prophylactic antibiotics to be given within one 
hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to surgical incision (or start of 
procedure when no incision is required)  
 
RATIONALE: 
The appropriate timing of administration of prophylactic antibiotics has been demonstrated to 
reduce the incidence of surgical wound infections. Available evidence suggests that although most 
surgical patients receive a prophylactic antibiotic, many do not receive the drug within one hour 
before incision as recommended.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The anti-infective drug should ideally be given within 30 minutes to 1 hour before the initial incision 
to ensure its presence in an adequate concentration in the targeted tissues. For most procedures, 
scheduling administration at the time of induction of anesthesia ensures adequate concentrations 
during the period of potential contamination. Exceptions: cesarean procedures (after cross 
clamping of the umbilical cord); colonic procedures (starting 19 hours before the scheduled time of 
surgery). (ASHP) 
 
Infusion of the first antimicrobial dose should begin within 60 minutes before incision. However, 
when a fluoroquinolone or vancomycin is indicated, the infusion should begin within 120 minutes 
before incision to prevent antibiotic-associated reactions. Although research has demonstrated that 
 
 
12/31/2007

administration of the antimicrobial at the time of anesthesia induction is safe and results in adequate 
serum and tissue drug levels at the time of incision, there was no consensus that the infusion must 
be completed before incision. (SIPGWW)

99291  
 
RATIONALE: 
Patients on bed rest are at high risk for deep vein thrombosis. DVT prevention is important for all 
patients who have suffered a stroke or an intracranial hemorrhage and may have decreased 
mobility. The intent of this measure is to assure that adequate DVT prophylaxis is received for 
either diagnosis. As noted in the clinical recommendation statements, the appropriate type of 
prophylaxis differs by diagnosis. Anticoagulants are generally contraindicated in patients with 
intracranial hemorrhage. These patients are still at risk for DVT so they should receive prophylaxis 
with mechanical devices. Low-dose subcutaneous heparin may be initiated on the second day after 
onset of the hemorrhage.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, LMW heparins, and heparinoids may be considered for DVT 
prophylaxis in at-risk patients with acute ischemic stroke, recognizing that nonpharmacologic 
treatments for DVT prevention also exist. (Coull, AAN/ASA, 2002) (Grade A) 
 
The use of intermittent external compression stockings or aspirin for patients who cannot receive 
anticoagulants is strongly recommended to prevent deep vein thrombosis among immobilized 
patients. (Adams, ASA, 2003) (Grades A and B) 
 
For acute stroke patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose 
subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins or heparinoid. (Grade 1A) In patients with 
an acute ICH, we recommend the initial use of intermittent pneumatic compression for the 
prevention of DVT and PE. (Grade 1C+) In stable patients, we suggest low-dose subcutaneous 
heparin may be initiated as soon as the second day after the onset of the hemorrhage. (Grade 2C)

RATIONALE: 
Following a stroke, patients should be prescribed antiplatelet therapy to decrease the risk of 
additional strokes. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
We recommend that every patient who has experienced a noncardioembolic (atherothrombotic, 
lacunar, or cryptogenic) stroke or TIA and has no contraindication receives an antiplatelet agent 
regularly to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events. Aspirin, 50 to 325 mg qd; 
the combination of aspirin, 25 mg, and extended-release dipyridamole, 200 mg bid; or clopidogrel, 
75 mg qd, are all acceptable options for initial therapy. (Albers, ACCP, 2001) (Grade 1A) 
 
For patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, antiplatelet agents rather than oral 
anticoagulation are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular 
events. (Sacco, ASA, 2006) (Class I, Level of Evidence: A) 
 
Aspirin (50 to 325 mg/d), the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, and

RATIONALE: 
Patients with atrial fibrillation (permanent, persistent, or paroxysmal) and stroke should be 
prescribed an anticoagulant to prevent recurrent strokes.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Administer antithrombotic therapy (oral anticoagulation or aspirin) to all patients with AF, except 
those with lone AF, to prevent thromboembolism. (ACC/AHA/ESC, 2001)(Class I, Level of 
Evidence: A) 
 
We recommend that clinicians use long-term oral anticoagulation (target INR of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 
3.0) for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients who have suffered a recent stroke or TIA. 
Oral anticoagulation is also beneficial for prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with several 
other high-risk cardiac sources. (Albers, ACCP, 2001) (Grade 1A) 
For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA with persistent or paroxysmal AF, anticoagulation with 
adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR, 2.5; range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended. (Sacco, ASA, 2006)

RATIONALE: 
Patients with elevated risk for osteoporosis should have the diagnosis of osteoporosis excluded or 
be on treatment of osteoporosis.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that women aged 65 and older 
be screened routinely for osteoporosis. (B Recommendation) (USPSTF) 
 
The USPSTF recommends that routine screening begin at age 60 for women at increased risk for 
osteoporotic fractures. Use of risk factors, particularly increasing age, low weight, and non-use of 
estrogen replacement, to screen younger women may identify high-risk women. (B 
Recommendation) (USPSTF) 
 
BMD measurement should be performed in all women beyond 65 years of age. Dual x-ray 
absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and proximal femur provides reproducible values at important 
sites of osteoporosis-associated fracture. These sites are preferred for baseline and serial 
measurements. (AACE) 
 
The most important risk factors for osteoporosis-related fractures are a prior low-trauma fracture as 
an adult and a low BMD in patients with or without fractures. (AACE)  
 
BMD testing should be performed on: 
• All women aged 65 and older regardless of risk factors 
• Younger postmenopausal women with one or more risk factors (other than being white, 
postmenopausal, and female) 
• Postmenopausal women who present with fractures (NQF)  
 
 
12/31/2007  
87
  
 
The decision to test for BMD should be based on an individual’s risk profile. Testing is never 
indicated unless the results could influence a treatment decision. (NQF) 
 
Markers of greater osteoporosis and fracture risk include older age, hypogonadism, corticosteroid 
therapy, and established cirrhosis. (Level B Evidence) (NQF) 
 
The single most powerful predictor of a future osteoporotic fracture is the presence of previous 
such fractures. (NQF) 
 
Pharmacologic therapy should be initiated to reduce fracture risk in women with: 
• BMD T-scores below -2.0 by central dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with no risk factors 
• BMD T-scores below -1.5 by central dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with one or more risk 
factors 
• A prior vertebral or hip fracture (NQF) 
 
The decision to measure bone density should follow an individualized approach. It should be 
considered when it will help the patient decide whether to institute treatment to prevent 
osteoporotic fracture. It should also be considered in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for 2 
months or more and patients with other conditions that place them at high risk for osteoporotic 
fracture. (NIH) 
 
The most commonly used measurement to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fracture risk is 
based on assessment of BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). (NIH)  
 
Measurements of BMD made at the hip predict hip fracture better than measurements made at 
other sites while BMD measurement at the spine predicts spine fracture better than measures at 
other sites. (NIH)

Measure #40: Osteoporosis: Management Following Fracture 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 50 years and older with fracture of the hip, spine or distal radius who 
had a central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement ordered or performed or 
pharmacologic therapy prescribed 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported after each occurrence of a fracture during the reporting period. 
Patients with a fracture of the hip, spine, or distal radius should have a central DXA measurement 
ordered or performed or pharmacologic therapy prescribed. The management (DXA ordered or 
performed or pharmacologic therapy prescribed) should occur within three months of the initial visit 
with the reporting clinician following the fracture. If multiple fractures occurring on the same date of 
service are submitted on the same claim form, only one instance of reporting will be counted. 
Claims data will be analyzed to determine unique occurrences. Patients with documentation of 
prior central DXA measurement or already receiving pharmacologic therapy would automatically 
meet the intent of this measure. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the 
quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific 
denominator coding.  
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, CPT procedure codes, and patient demographics 
(age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. 
CPT Category II codes are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, 
CPT procedure codes, and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code 
with the modifier. The modifiers allowed for this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 2P- patient 
reasons, 3P- system reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified.

RATIONALE: 
Patients with a history of fracture should have a baseline bone mass measurement and/or receive 
treatment for osteoporosis. Given that the majority of osteoporotic fractures occur in patients with a 
diagnosis of osteoporosis by bone mass measurement, exclusion of osteoporosis by bone mass 
testing does not preclude treatment of osteoporosis in a patient with a history of fracture. There is a 
high degree of variability and consensus by experts of what constitutes a fragility fracture and 
predictor of an underlying problem of osteoporosis. The work group determined that only those 
fractures, which have the strongest consensus and evidence that they are predictive of 
osteoporosis, should be included in the measure at this time. We anticipate that the list of fractures 
will expand as further evidence is published supporting the inclusion of other fractures. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The most important risk factors for osteoporosis-related fractures are a prior low-trauma fracture as 
an adult and a low BMD in patients with or without fractures. (AACE) 
 
BMD measurement should be performed in all women 40 years old or older who have sustained a 
fracture. (AACE) 
 
The single most powerful predictor of a future osteoporotic fracture is the presence of previous 
such fractures. (AACE)

Agents approved by the FDA for osteoporosis prevention and/or treatment include (in alphabetical 
order) bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate), salmon calcitonin, estrogen, 
raloxifene, and teriparatide. All act by reducing bone resorption, except for teriparatide, which has 
anabolic effects on bone. Although estrogen is not approved for treatment of osteoporosis, there is 
level 1 evidence for its efficacy in reducing vertebral fractures, nonvertebral fractures, and hip 
fractures. Level 1 evidence of efficacy in reducing the risk of vertebral fractures is available for all 
the agents approved for treatment of osteoporosis (bisphosphonates, calcitonin, raloxifene, and 
teriparatide). Prospective trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of bisphosphonates and 
teriparatide in reducing the risk of nonvertebral fractures (level 1), but only bisphosphonates have 
been shown to reduce the risk of hip fractures in prospective controlled trials (level 1). (AACE) 
 
US Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic options for osteoporosis prevention 
and/or treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis include, in alphabetical order: bisphosphonates

This measure is to be reported for patients who undergo an isolated coronary artery bypass graft 
(CABG) procedure during the reporting period. It is anticipated that clinicians who provide services 
for isolated CABG will submit this measure. This measure is intended to reflect the quality of the 
surgical services provided for isolated CABG patients. Isolated CABG refers to CABG using arterial 
and/or venous grafts only. Part B claims data will be analyzed to determine “isolated” CABG. This 
measure does not include patients undergoing repeat CABG surgery. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
CPT procedure codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the 
numerator of the measure. 
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed CPT procedure codes and the appropriate CPT 
Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The modifiers allowed for this 
measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified.

RATIONALE: 
A major innovation has been the introduction of off-bypass CABG, which has reduced the post-
procedure length of stay in some centers to between 2 and 3 days. In some centers, this has led to 
a total 3-month cost for single-vessel coronary bypass that is not significantly different from the 
total 3-month cost for angioplasty of single-vessel disease. Considering the favorable long-term 
patency of an internal mammary artery (IMA) graft to the LAD, the cost reductions possible with off-
bypass CABG may improve the relative cost-effectiveness of coronary bypass compared with 
either medical therapy or percutaneous techniques, particularly for symptomatic, proximal LAD 
disease. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Class I 
In every patient undergoing CABG, the left internal mammary artery (IMA) should be given primary 
consideration for revascularization of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. (Level of Evidence:

INSTRUCTIONS:    
This measure is to be reported for patients who undergo an isolated coronary artery bypass graft 
(CABG) procedure during the reporting period. It is anticipated that clinicians who provide services 
for isolated CABG will submit this measure. Isolated CABG refers to CABG using arterial and/or

DENOMINATOR: 
Patients with isolated coronary artery bypass graft  
 
Denominator Coding:    
A CPT procedure code for isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery is required to 
identify patients for denominator inclusion. 
CPT procedure codes: 33510, 33511, 33512, 33513, 33514, 33516, 33517, 33518, 
33519, 33521, 33522, 33523, 33533, 33534, 33535, 33536 
 
RATIONALE: 
In patients at risk of cardiovascular complications in a variety of medical conditions, beta-blockers 
have shown to reduce that risk. Studies show that patients with a history of myocardial infarction, 
who have had beta-blocker therapy initiated and continued, have a 20 to 30% reduction in 
subsequent coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality (Yusuf, 1985). In a 
meta analysis by McGory et al (2005), long-term cardiac mortality and myocardial ischemia were 
reduced significantly by perioperative beta blockade. Patients maintained on beta-blockers, without 
complications that might warrant discontinuation, are good candidates for continuation of beta-
blockers through the perioperative period. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Prevention of Postoperative Arrhythmias 
Class I 
Preoperative or early postoperative administration of beta-blockers in patients without 
contraindications should be used as the standard therapy to reduce the incidence and/or clinical 
sequelae of atrial fibrillation after CABG. (Level of Evidence: B) 
 
The use of b-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates plays a significant role in ensuring 
that the myocardial oxygen demand does not exceed the supply. Patients well compensated while 
receiving these agents should be continued on their therapy through the perioperative period. 
Special attention should be paid to avoiding excess catecholamine effects by the sudden 
withdrawal of b-blocker therapy. At least one study supports the use of b-blocker immediately prior 
to surgery: in 1988, Stone and colleagues gave oral b-blockers 2 hours prior to surgery and 
reported a decrease in frequency of ST segment depression from 28% among control patients to 
2% in treated patients. Similarly, in 1987, Pasternack and colleagues reported a reduction from 
18% to 3% incidence of acute perioperative myocardial infarction in patients treated with 
metoprolol immediately prior to and following surgery. More recently, Podesser and colleagues 
demonstrated in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass procedures that the combination of 
nifedipine and metoprolol was associated with a lower incidence of ischemic events than nifedipine 
alone.

Measure #45: Perioperative Care: Discontinuation of Prophylactic Antibiotics (Cardiac 
Procedures) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of cardiac surgical patients aged 18 years and older undergoing procedures with the 
indications for prophylactic antibiotics AND who received a prophylactic antibiotic, who have an 
order for discontinuation of prophylactic antibiotics within 48 hours of surgical end time 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported each time a procedure is performed during the reporting period for 
patients who undergo cardiac procedures with the indications for prophylactic antibiotics. There is 
no diagnosis associated with this measure. It is anticipated that clinicians who perform the listed 
surgical procedures as specified in the denominator coding will submit this measure. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
CPT procedure codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the 
numerator of the measure. If multiple surgical procedures were performed on the same date of 
service and submitted on the same claim form, it is not necessary to submit the CPT Category II 
code with each procedure. 
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed CPT procedure code and the appropriate CPT 
Category II code(s) OR the CPT Category II code(s) with the modifier. The modifiers allowed for 
this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Cardiac surgical patients who have an order for discontinuation of prophylactic antibiotics within 48 
hours of surgical end time 
 
Numerator Instructions: There must be documentation of order (written order, verbal 
order, or standing order/protocol) specifying that prophylactic antibiotic is to be 
discontinued within 48 hours of surgical end time OR specifying a course of antibiotic 
administration limited to that 48-hour period (e.g., “to be given every 8 hours for three 
doses”) OR documentation that prophylactic antibiotic was discontinued within 48 hours of 
surgical end time. 
 
NUMERATOR NOTE: The correct combination of numerator code(s) must be reported on 
the claim form in order to properly report this measure. The “correct combination” of codes 
may require the submission of multiple numerator codes.

RATIONALE: 
There is no evidence there is added benefit of prolonged prophylactic antibiotic use. Prolonged use 
may increase antibiotic resistant organisms.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
At a minimum, antimicrobial coverage must be provided from the time of incision to closure of the 
incision. For most procedures, the duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis should be 24 hours or less, 
with the exception of cardiothoracic procedures (up to 72 hours’ duration) and ophthalmic 
procedures (duration not clearly established). (ASHP) 
 
There is evidence indicating that antibiotic prophylaxis of 48 hours duration is effective. There is 
some evidence that single-dose prophylaxis or 24-hour prophylaxis may be as effective as 48-hour 
prophylaxis, but additional studies are necessary before confirming the effectiveness of prophylaxis 
lasting less than 48 hours. There is no evidence that prophylaxis administered for longer than 48 
hours is more effective than a 48-hour regimen. Optimal practice: Antibiotic prophylaxis is not 
continued for more than 48 hours postoperatively. (STS) (Class IIa, Level B)

Measure #46: Medication Reconciliation 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 65 years and older discharged from any inpatient facility (e.g., 
hospital, skilled nursing facility, or rehabilitation facility) and seen within 60 days following 
discharge in the office by the physician providing on-going care who had a reconciliation of the 
discharge medications with the current medication list in the medical record documented 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported at an office visit occurring within 60 days of each inpatient facility 
discharge date during the reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. If 
multiple claims are submitted within 60 days of inpatient discharge, only one instance of reporting 
will be counted. Part B claims data will be analyzed to determine the inpatient facility discharge 
date. This measure is appropriate for use in the ambulatory setting only. This measure may be 
reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the 
services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. This measure is not to be 
reported unless a patient has been discharged from an inpatient facility within 60 days prior to the 
outpatient visit. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
CPT E/M service codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the 
numerator of the measure.  
 
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed CPT E/M service codes and the appropriate CPT 
Category II codes OR the CPT Category II codes with the modifier. The reporting modifier allowed 
for this measure is: 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. There are no allowable performance 
exclusions for this measure. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients who had a reconciliation of the discharge medications with the current medication list in 
the medical record documented  
 
Definition: The medical record must indicate that the clinician is aware of the inpatient 
facility discharge medications and will either keep the inpatient facility discharge 
medications or change the inpatient facility discharge medications or the dosage of an 
inpatient facility discharge medication.

Medications are often changed while a patient is hospitalized. Continuity between inpatient and on-
going care is essential.  
 
 
 
 
 
12/31/2007  
104
  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
No trials of the effects of physician acknowledgment of medications post-discharge were found. 
However, patients are likely to have their medications changed during a hospitalization. One 
observational study showed that 1.5 new medications were initiated per patient during 
hospitalization, and 28% of chronic medications were canceled by the time of hospital discharge. 
Another observational study showed that at one week post-discharge, 72% of elderly patients were 
taking incorrectly at least one medication started in the inpatient setting, and 32% of medications 
were not being taken at all. One survey study faulted the quality of discharge communication as 
contributing to early hospital readmission, although this study did not implicate medication 
discontinuity as the cause. (ACOVE) 
 
First, a medication list must be collected. It is important to know what medications the patient has 
been taking or receiving prior to the outpatient visit in order to provide quality care. This applies 
regardless of the setting from which the patient came — home, long-term care, assisted living, etc.  
The medication list should include all medications (prescriptions, over-the-counter, herbals, 
supplements, etc.) with dose, frequency, route, and reason for taking it. It is also important to verify 
whether the patient is actually taking the medication as prescribed or instructed, as sometimes this 
is not the case. 
  
At the end of the outpatient visit, a clinician needs to verify three questions: 
1. Based on what occurred in the visit, should any medication that the patient was taking or 
receiving prior to the visit be discontinued or altered?  
2. Based on what occurred in the visit, should any prior medication be suspended pending 
consultation with the prescriber?  
3. Have any new prescriptions been added today? 
 
These questions should be reviewed by the physician who completed the procedure, or the 
physician who evaluated and treated the patient. 
• If the answer to all three questions is “no,” the process is complete. 
• If the answer to any question is “yes,” the patient needs to receive clear instructions about 
what to do — all changes, holds, and discontinuations of medications should be 
specifically noted. Include any follow-up required, such as calling or making appointments 
with other practitioners and a timeframe for doing so. (IHI)

Measure #47: Advance Care Plan 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 65 years and older who have an advance care plan or surrogate 
decision maker documented in the medical record or documentation in the medical record that an 
advance care plan was discussed but the patient did not wish or was not able to name a surrogate 
decision maker or provide an advance care plan in the medical record 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients seen during the 
reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be 
reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the 
services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is appropriate for use in all healthcare settings (e.g., inpatient, nursing home, 
ambulatory) except the emergency department. For each of these settings, there should be 
documentation in the medical record(s) that advance care planning was discussed or documented.  
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
CPT E/M service codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the 
numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed CPT E/M service codes and the appropriate CPT 
Category II codes OR the CPT Category II code(s) with the modifier. The reporting modifier 
allowed for this measure is: 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. There are no allowable 
performance exclusions for this measure. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients who have an advance care plan or surrogate decision maker documented in the medical 
record or documentation in the medical record that an advance care plan was discussed but 
patient did not wish or was not able to name a surrogate decision maker or provide an advance 
care plan 
 
Definition:  For the purposes of this measure, “documentation that patient did not wish or 
was not able to name a surrogate decision or provide an advance care plan” may also 
include, as appropriate, the following:  
• That the patient’s cultural and/or spiritual beliefs preclude a discussion of advance 
care planning, as it would be viewed as harmful to the patient's beliefs and thus 
harmful to the physician-patient relationship  
 
Numerator Instruction: If patient’s cultural and/or spiritual beliefs preclude a discussion of 
advance care planning, report 1124F.

*Clinicians indicating the place of service as the emergency department will not be 
included in this measure. 
 
RATIONALE: 
It is essential that the patient’s wishes regarding medical treatment be established as much as 
possible prior to incapacity. The Work Group has determined that the measure should remain as 
specified with no required time frame based on a review of the literature. Studies have shown that 
people do change their preferences often with regard to advanced care planning, but it primarily 
occurs after a major medical event or other health status change. In the stable patient, it would be 
very difficult to define the correct interval. It was felt by the Work Group that the error rate in simply 
not having addressed the issue at all is so much more substantial (Teno 1997) than the risk that an 
established plan has become outdated that we should not define a specific time frame at this time. 
As this measure is tested and reviewed, we will continue to evaluate if and when a specific time 
frame should be included.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Advance directives are designed to respect patient’s autonomy and determine his/her wishes about 
future life-sustaining medical treatment if unable to indicate wishes. Key interventions and 
treatment decisions to include in advance directives are: resuscitation procedures, mechanical 
respiration, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, dialysis, simple diagnostic tests, pain control, blood 
products, transfusions, and intentional deep sedation.

RATIONALE: 
Evaluation of lung function for a patient with COPD is vital to determine what treatments are 
needed and whether those treatments are effective. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Spirometry should be performed in all patients suspected of COPD. This is necessary for 
diagnosis, assessment of severity of the disease and for following the progress of the disease. 
(ATS and ERS) 
 
For the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, spirometry is the gold standard as it is the most 
reproducible, standardized, and objective way of measuring airflow limitation. FEV1/FVC < 70% 
and a postbronchodilator FEV1 < 80% predicted confirms the presence of airflow limitation that is 
not fully reversible. (NHLBI/WHO) 
 
A patient's decline in lung function is best tracked by periodic spirometry measurements. Useful 
information about lung function decline is unlikely from spirometry measurements performed more 
than once a year. Spirometry should be performed if there is a substantial increase in symptoms or 
a complication. (NHLBI/WHO)

RATIONALE: 
Inhaled bronchodilator therapy is effective in treating and managing the symptoms of COPD, 
particularly, for those patients with moderate to very severe COPD, and improving a patient’s 
quality of life.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Short-acting bronchodilators can increase exercise tolerance acutely in COPD. (ATS and ERS) 
 
Bronchodilator medications are central to the symptomatic management of COPD. (Evidence A) 
(NHLBI/ WHO) 
 
A combination of a short-acting β2-agonist and an anticholinergic produces greater and more 
sustained improvements in FEV1 than either alone and does not produce evidence of tachyphylaxis 
over 90 days of treatment. (Evidence A) (NHLBI/WHO) 
 
In patients with Stage II: Moderate COPD to Stage IV: Very Severe COPD whose symptoms are 
not adequately controlled with as-needed short-acting bronchodilators, adding regular treatment 
with a long-acting inhaled bronchodilator is recommended. (Evidence A) NHLBI/WHO) 
 
Regular treatment with long-acting bronchodilators is more effective and convenient than treatment 
with short-acting bronchodilators, but more expensive. (Evidence A) (NHLBI/WHO)

Although current guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids as the preferred pharmacological 
treatment for persistent asthma, other long-term control medications are acceptable alternatives. 
Long Acting-inhaled Beta2 Agonists (LABA) are recommended in combination with Inhaled 
Corticosteroids 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
A stepwise approach to therapy is recommended to maintain long-term control: 
• Step 1: Mild Intermittent Asthma 
• No daily medication needed 
• Step 2: Mild Persistent Asthma 
• Preferred treatment: Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) 
• Alternative treatment: Cromolyn, leukotriene modifier, nedocromil, OR sustained-release 
theophylline 
• Step 3: Moderate Persistent Asthma 
• Preferred treatment: Low-medium dose ICS + long-acting inhaled beta2-agonists (LABA) 
• Alternative treatment: Increase medium-dose ICS OR low-medium dose ICS and either 
leukotriene modifier or theophylline (If needed, may increase ICS within medium-dose 
range in either treatment) 
• Step 4: Severe Persistent Asthma 
• Preferred treatment: High-dose ICS + LABA AND, if needed, corticosteroid tablets or syrup 
long-term 
 
Studies comparing ICS to cromolyn, nedocromil, theophylline, or leukotriene receptor antagonists 
are limited, but available evidence shows that none of these long-term control medications appear 
to be as effective as ICS in improving asthma outcomes. 
 
For quick relief for all patients, a short-acting bronchodilator is recommended as needed for 
symptoms. (NAEPP/NHLBI)

Measure #54: Electrocardiogram Performed for Non-Traumatic Chest Pain  
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION:  
Percentage of patients aged 40 years and older with an emergency department discharge 
diagnosis of non-traumatic chest pain who had a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:  
This measure is to be reported each time a patient has been discharged from the emergency 
department with a discharge diagnosis of non-traumatic chest pain during the reporting period. 
Claims data will be analyzed to determine the emergency department discharge. Patients who 
were discharged from an emergency department with a diagnosis of non-traumatic chest pain 
should have documentation in the medical record of having a 12-lead ECG performed. It is 
anticipated that clinicians who provide care in the emergency department will submit this measure.

AND 
Place of Service Indicator: 23 
 
RATIONALE: 
12-lead ECG can occasionally pick up potentially life-threatening conditions such as pre-excitation 
syndromes, prolonged QT syndromes, or Brugada’s syndrome in otherwise healthy appearing 
young adults. 12-lead ECG testing is performed inconsistently, even in high risk patients; the 
largest study to date of 12-lead ECG testing variation in ED syncope visits using a 9 year national 
sample illustrated that 12-lead ECG testing was documented in only 59% of ED syncope visits. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Obtain a standard 12-lead ECG in patients with syncope when history and physical examination do 
not reveal a diagnosis. (ACEP) (Level A) 
• A patient with normal 12-lead ECG has a low likelihood of dysrhythmias as a cause of 
syncope. 
• Abnormal 12-lead ECG has been associated as being the most important predictor of 
serious outcomes and a multivariate predictor for arrhythmia or death within 1 year after 
the syncopal episode.

* Clinicians utilizing the critical care code must indicate the emergency department place-
of-service (23) on the Part B claim form in order to report this measure. 
 
RATIONALE: 
Each of the vital signs should be recorded in the emergency department. While vital signs may be 
routinely recorded, there likely is a gap in care on acting on those values that warrant further 
evaluation. Moreover, it is important for physicians to review the vital signs to ensure continuous 
quality improvement and consistent patient care. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
It is necessary to assess the severity of illness. This includes the radiographic findings (multilobar 
pneumonia or pleural effusion) and physical findings (respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, signs of dehydrations and mental status). (ATS) (Level II Evidence)

Measure #65: Appropriate Treatment for Children with Upper Respiratory Infection (URI) 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of children aged 3 months through 18 years with a diagnosis of upper respiratory 
infection (URI) who were not prescribed or dispensed an antibiotic prescription on or within 3 days 
of the initial date of service 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:  
This measure is to be reported once for each occurrence of upper respiratory infection during the 
reporting period. Claims data will be analyzed to determine unique occurrences. This measure may 
be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the 
services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, and patient demographics (age, etc.) are used to 
identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used 
to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, 
and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The 
modifier allowed for this measure is: 1P- medical reasons.  
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients who were not dispensed an antibiotic prescription on or within 3 days of the initial date of 
service 
 
Numerator Instructions: For performance, the measure will be calculated as the number 
of patients for whom antibiotics were neither prescribed nor dispensed over the number of 
patients in the denominator (patients aged 3 months through 18 years with URI). A higher 
score indicates appropriate treatment of patients with URI (e.g., the proportion for whom 
antibiotics were not prescribed or dispensed). 
 
Numerator Coding: 
Antibiotic not Prescribed or Dispensed 
CPT II 4124F: Antibiotic neither prescribed nor dispensed 
OR 
Antibiotic Prescribed or Dispensed for Medical Reasons  
Append a modifier (1P) to CPT Category II code 4120F to report documented 
circumstances that appropriately exclude patients from the denominator.

DENOMINATOR: 
All patients aged 3 months through 18 years with a diagnosis of upper respiratory infection 
 
Denominator Coding: 
An ICD-9 diagnosis code for upper respiratory infection (URI) and a CPT E/M service code 
are required to identify patients for denominator inclusion. 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes: 460, 465.0, 465.8, 465.9 
AND

RATIONALE: 
Existing clinical guidelines do not support the use of antibiotics for the common cold/upper 
respiratory infection.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Recent clinical practice guidelines set out the evidence supporting the recommendations for 
treating a host of upper respiratory tract infections in pediatrics. The guidelines do not recommend 
antibiotics for a majority of upper respiratory tract infections, except for conditions with bacterial 
etiology such as acute otitis media, bacterial sinusitis, mucopurulent rhinitis with prolonged 
symptoms, i.e., at least 10 days of continual symptoms, and group A streptococcal pharyngitis (but 
only cases with a confirmatory test for group A strep). The guidelines support targeting treatment of 
non-specific URI (the common cold) or viral rhinosinusitis with antibiotics as an indicator of 
inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.

RATIONALE: 
Clinical practice guidelines recommend group A streptococcus pharyngitis be treated with 
antibiotics (Schwartz et al, 1998). 
 
 
 
 
12/31/2007  
141
  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The group A strep test (rapid assay or throat culture) is the definitive test of group A strep 
pharyngitis. Pharyngitis is the only respiratory tract infection with an objective diagnostic test that 
can be validated with administrative data, and not medical records. A process measure that 
requires the performance of a group A strep test for children given antibiotics for pharyngitis is 
supported by the guidelines. (Ibid)

99215, 99241, 99242, 99243, 99244, 99245  
 
RATIONALE: 
For MDS: 
Cytogenetic testing is an integral component in calculating the International Prognostic Scoring 
System (IPSS) score. Cytogenetic testing should be performed on the bone marrow of patients 
with MDS in order to guide treatment options, determine prognosis, and predict the likelihood of 
disease evolution to leukemia. 
 
For acute leukemias: 
In addition to establishing the type of acute leukemia, cytogenetic testing is essential to detect 
chromosomal abnormalities that have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic significance.  
 
 
 
 
 
12/31/2007  
144
  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
For MDS: 
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are needed to calculate the degree of hematopoietic cell 
maturation abnormalities and relative proportions, percentage of marrow blasts, marrow cellularity, 
presence or absence of ringed sideroblasts (and presence of iron per se), and fibrosis. Marrow 
cytogenetics should be obtained because they are of major importance for prognosis (Category 2A 
Recommendation). (NCCN)  
 
The decision to treat patients having marrow blasts in the range of 20% to 30% with intensive AML 
therapy is thus complex and should be individualized. The clinician should consider such factors as 
age, antecedent factors, cytogenetics, comorbidities, pace of disease, and performance status 
(Category 2A Recommendation). (NCCN) 
 
A chromosome abnormality confirms the presence of a clonal disorder aiding the distinction 
between MDS and reactive causes of dysplasia, and in addition has major prognostic value. 
Cytogenetic analysis should therefore be performed for all patients in whom a bone marrow 
examination is indicated. (BCSH) 
 
For acute leukemias: 
The initial evaluation has two objectives. The first is to identify the pathology causing the disease 
including factors such as prior toxic exposure or myelodysplasia, cytogenetics and molecular 
markers that may have an impact on chemoresponsiveness and propensity for relapse which may 
guide choice of treatment. The second objective focuses on patient-specific factors including 
comorbid conditions that may affect an individual's ability to tolerate chemotherapy (Category 2A 
Recommendation). (NCCN) 
 
Although cytogenetic information is usually unknown when treatment is initiated in patients with de 
novo AML, karyotype represents the single most important prognostic factor for predicting 
remission rate, relapse, and overall survival. Therefore, the importance of obtaining sufficient 
samples of marrow or peripheral blood blasts at diagnosis for this analysis cannot be 
overemphasized (Category 2A Recommendation). (NCCN)

Multiple myeloma is a disease characterized by bone destruction, in the form of diffuse osteopenia 
and/or osteolytic lesions, which develop in 85% of patients. Bisphosphonates can inhibit bone 
resorption by reducing the number and activity of osteoclasts and therefore could “reduce pain and 
bone fractures in people with multiple myeloma”. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Based on published data and clinical experience, the guidelines recommend the use of 
bisphosphonates for all patients with multiple myeloma who have bone disease, including 
osteopenia. In 10% to 20% of patients with earlier-stage disease who do not have bone disease, 
bisphosphonates may be considered but preferably in a clinical trial (Category 1 
Recommendation). (NCCN) 
 
Intravenous bisphosphonates should be administered monthly for patients with MM and lytic 
disease evident on plain radiographs (Grade A, Level II). It is reasonable to start intravenous 
bisphosphonates in patients with MM who do not have lytic bone disease if there is evidence of 
osteopenia or osteoporosis on bone mineral density studies (Consensus Recommendation, Level 
N/A). No randomized clinical trials support the use of bisphosphonates in patients with smoldering 
MM. We believe that bisphosphonates should be used only in the setting of a clinical trial [in these 
patients] (Consensus Recommendation, Level N/A). (Mayo Clinic)

Measure #70: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): Baseline Flow Cytometry 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of CLL who had baseline flow 
cytometry studies performed 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients seen during the 
reporting period, regardless of when the baseline flow cytometry studies are performed. It is 
anticipated that clinicians who provide services for patients with the diagnosis of chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, not in remission, will submit this measure. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are 
used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes 
are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, 
and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The 
modifiers allowed for this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 2P- patient reasons, 3P- system 
reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified.   
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients who had baseline flow cytometry studies performed 
 
Definition: Baseline flow cytometry studies refer to testing that is performed at time of 
diagnosis or prior to initiating treatment for that diagnosis. Treatment may include anti-
neoplastic therapy.

when the action described in the numerator is not performed and the reason is not 
otherwise specified.  
• 8P: Flow cytometry studies not performed at time of diagnosis or prior to initiating 
treatment, reason not otherwise specified 
 
DENOMINATOR: 
All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of CLL 
 
Denominator Coding: 
An ICD-9 diagnosis code for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, not in remission, and a CPT 
E/M service code are required to identify patients for denominator inclusion. 
ICD-9 diagnosis code: 204.10 
AND 
CPT E/M service codes: 99201, 99202, 99203, 99204, 99205, 99212, 99213, 99214, 
99215, 99241, 99242, 99243, 99244, 99245  
 
RATIONALE: 
Due to the distinct pattern of protein antigens expressed in CLL, flow cytometry should be 
performed in order to confirm the diagnosis, correctly characterize the pathological cells, and 
determine prognosis. In some instances, flow cytometry may also offer additional therapeutically 
relevant information. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
As with all the lymphoid neoplasms, adequate hematopathologic review is essential to establish an 
accurate diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma CLL/SLL. 
…a combination of morphologic and flow cytometric studies may provide adequate information to 
provide a diagnosis. This is particularly true for the diagnosis of CLL. Flow cytometric studies 
performed on patients with leukemic cell burden include kappa/lambda to [assess] clonality… 
Distinguishing CLL/SLL from mantle cell lymphoma is essential (Category 2A Recommendation).

RATIONALE: 
Despite evidence suggesting the role of adjuvant endocrine therapy in lowering the risk of tumor 
recurrence, many female patients who should be receiving this therapy are not. This measure 
assesses whether patients with a certain stage of breast cancer (IC through IIIC) and ER/PR+ are 
currently receiving the therapy. There are allowable medical, patient, and system reasons to 
document instances in which a woman with stage IC through IIIC, ER/PR+ may not be a candidate 
for the therapy. Note: the reporting/managing physician does not need to have actually written the 
 
 
12/31/2007  
156
  
 
prescription; however the reporting/managing physician must verify that the patient already has 
been prescribed the hormonal therapy by another physician. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer should 
include an aromatase inhibitor in order to lower the risk of tumor recurrence. Aromatase inhibitors 
are appropriate as initial treatment for women with contraindications to tamoxifen. For all other 
postmenopausal women, treatment options include 5 years of aromatase inhibitors treatment or 
sequential therapy consisting of tamoxifen (for either 2 to 3 years or 5 years) followed by 
aromatase inhibitors for 2 to 3, or 5 years (ASCO guidelines include narrative rankings). (ASCO)  
 
Patients intolerant of aromatase inhibitors should receive tamoxifen. Women with hormone 
receptor–negative tumors should not receive adjuvant endocrine therapy (ASCO guidelines include 
narrative rankings). (ASCO)   
 
Patients with invasive breast cancers that are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive should be 
considered for adjuvant endocrine therapy regardless of patient age, lymph node status, or 
whether or not adjuvant chemotherapy is to be administered (Category 2A). (NCCN)   
 
The most firmly established adjuvant endocrine therapy is tamoxifen for both premenopausal and 
postmenopausal women. Prospective, randomized trials demonstrate that the optimal duration of 
tamoxifen appears to be five years. In patients receiving both tamoxifen and chemotherapy, 
chemotherapy should be given first, followed by sequential tamoxifen. Several studies have 
evaluated aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of postmenopausal women with early-stage breast 
cancer (Category 2A). (NCCN)

DENOMINATOR: 
All female patients aged 18 through 70 years with invasive breast cancer  
 
Denominator Coding:  
An ICD-9 diagnosis code for invasive breast cancer and a CPT E/M service code are 
required to identify patients for denominator inclusion. 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes: 174.0, 174.1, 174.2, 174.3, 174.4, 174.5, 174.6, 174.8, 174.9  
AND 
CPT E/M service codes: 99241, 99242, 99243, 99244, 99245 
 
RATIONALE: 
Data from multiple large randomized trials have demonstrated that the addition of radiation after 
breast conserving surgery in patients with invasive breast cancer lowers the risk of local 
recurrence. The Oxford meta-analysis of these studies (Peto, et. al., Lancet, 2006) has also 
detected an improvement in overall survival with the use of radiation therapy in this setting. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Refer to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Breast Cancer guideline recommendations 
v2.2006, BINV-2. 
 
The National Quality Forum is in the process of approving the National Voluntary Consensus 
Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment of Breast and Colon Cancer, which includes a measure at 
the facility level for radiation therapy for patients who have had breast conserving surgery for 
accountability purposes.

Measure #75: Prevention of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia – Head Elevation 
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of ICU patients aged 18 years and older who receive mechanical ventilation and who 
had an order on the first ventilator day for head of bed elevation (30-45 degrees) 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported once for each episode of care for all critically ill patients seen during 
the reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. An individual patient may 
have multiple ICU episodes during the same hospitalization. This measure should be reported for 
each new episode of care, even those that occur during the same hospitalization.   
Situations that define an episode include the following: 
1) The first instance 99291 is used (e.g., admission to the ICU or a new episode of critical 
care)   
2) Upon readmission to the ICU from another unit (e.g., discharged to a step-down unit, 
then readmitted to ICU due to complications) 
3) *Upon reintubation or intubation any time following admission to the ICU  
 
*The following is an example: For the patient initially admitted to the ICU, not receiving 
ventilation, CPT II 4169F (see coding below) would be reported. There may be instances 
when a critically ill patient is not ventilated at the initial instance of 99291; if the patient’s 
status changes during the episode, requiring ventilation, a second CPT II code (4168F) 
indicating that the patient is receiving ventilation should be reported; finally, if head of bed 
elevation is ordered, report CPT II code 4167F.   
 
It is anticipated that clinicians who provide care in the ICU will submit this measure. Clinicians 
utilizing the critical care code in the emergency department will not be included in this measure. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
CPT E/M service codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients 
who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the 
numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed CPT E/M service codes and the appropriate CPT 
Category II code(s) OR the CPT Category II code(s) with the modifier. The modifiers allowed for 
this measure are: 1P- medical reasons, 8P- reasons not otherwise specified.   
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients who had an order on the first ventilator day for head of bed elevation (30-45 degrees) 
 
NUMERATOR NOTE: The correct combination of numerator code(s) must be reported on 
the claim form in order to properly report this measure. The “correct combination” of codes 
may require the submission of multiple numerator codes.

*Clinicians indicating the place of service as the emergency department will not be 
included in this measure. 
 
RATIONALE: 
Mechanically ventilated patients are at high risk for aspiration pneumonia. Elevation of the head of 
the bed has been shown to reduce the risk of aspiration.  
 
Existing hospital-level measures for this topic were consulted and, to the extent feasible, 
harmonization between physician- and hospital-level measurement was achieved. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Patients should be kept in the semi-recumbent position (30–45°) rather than supine to prevent 
aspiration, especially when receiving enteral feeding. (ATS/IDSA) (Level I) 
 
In the absence of medical contraindication(s), elevate at an angle of 30-45 degrees the head of the 
bed of a patient at high risk for aspiration pneumonia (e.g., a person receiving mechanically 
assisted ventilation or who has an enteral tube in place). (CDC) (Category I)

Denominator Coding: 
A CPT procedure code for CVC insertion or replacement is required to identify patients for 
denominator inclusion. 
CPT procedure codes: 36555, 36556, 36557, 36558, 36560, 36561, 36563, 36565, 
36566, 36568, 36569, 36570, 36571, 36578, 36580, 36581, 36582, 36583, 36584, 36585 
 
RATIONALE: 
Catheter-related bloodstream infection is a costly complication of central venous catheter insertion, 
but may be avoided with routine use of aseptic technique during catheter insertion. This measure is 
constructed to require that all of the listed elements of aseptic technique are followed and 
documented.  
 
Existing hospital-level measures for this topic were consulted and, to the extent feasible, 
harmonization between physician- and hospital-level measurement was achieved. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Maximal sterile barrier precautions during catheter insertion: Use aseptic technique including the 
use of a cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves, and a large sterile sheet, for the insertion of CVCs 
(including PICCS) or guidewire exchange. (CDC/MMWR) (Category IA) 
 
Hand hygiene: Observe proper hand-hygiene procedures either by washing hands with 
conventional antiseptic-containing soap and water or with waterless alcohol-based gels or foams. 
Observe hand hygiene before and after palpating catheter insertion sites, as well as before and 
after inserting, replacing, accessing, repairing, or dressing an intravascular catheter. Palpation of 
the insertion site should not be performed after the application of antiseptic, unless aseptic 
technique is maintained. Use of gloves does not obviate the need for hand hygiene. (CDC/MMWR) 
(Category IA) 
 
Cutaneous antisepsis: Disinfect clean skin with an appropriate antiseptic before catheter insertion 
and during dressing changes. Although a 2% chlorhexidine-based preparation is preferred, tincture 
of iodine, an iodophor, or 70% alcohol can be used. (CDC/MMWR) (Category IA)

99215, 99241, 99242, 99243, 99244, 99245 
 
RATIONALE: 
Many patients with GERD remain on medication therapy for years, and experts suspect that not all 
patients are being reassessed on a regular basis to determine whether the medication is still 
needed. This measure attempts to capture whether or not a patient on chronic medication have 
their GERD symptoms are assessed at least annually. Research indicates that patients on chronic 
therapy are able to have their dose modified or reduced based on the presence or absence of 
symptoms. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Because GERD is a chronic condition, continuous therapy to control symptoms and prevent 
complications is appropriate. (ACG) 
 
Nonresponders to adequate trials of drug therapy, particularly PPI therapy, should have their 
symptoms reassessed, undergo endoscopy if it was not previously done, and be considered for 
additional diagnostic work-up. (VHA/DOD) 
 
Inadequate response to a 4- to 8-week course of standard-dose PPI may indicate longer treatment 
is needed, more severe disease, or incorrect diagnosis. If there is an adequate response to a 
course of standard-dose PPI (the recommended duration of therapy for PPIs in the treatment of 
GERD is 4 to 8 weeks), extend treatment with either the same or double dose of PPI. (VHA/DOD)

RATIONALE: 
A functioning AV fistula is the preferred delivery method for hemodialysis. This measure assesses 
two components: 1) whether patients have a functioning AV fistula, or 2) if not, was the patient 
referred for an AV fistula or permanent vascular access at least once during the reporting year. 
This measure captures actions that are within a nephrologist’s control (e.g., referral) rather than 
simply measuring the percentage of patients who have an AV fistula. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Patients should have a functional permanent access at the initiation of dialysis therapy. A fistula 
should be placed at least 6 months before the anticipated start of HD treatments. This timing allows 
for access evaluation and additional time for revision to ensure a working fistula is available at 
initiation of dialysis therapy. (B) A graft should, in most cases, be placed at least 3 to 6 weeks 
before the anticipated start of HD therapy. Some newer graft materials may be cannulated 
immediately after placement. (B) A peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter ideally should be placed at 
least 2 weeks before the anticipated start of dialysis treatments. A backup HD access does not 
need to be placed in most patients. A PD catheter may be used as a bridge for a fistula in 
“appropriate” patients. (B) (KDOQITM )

this high risk population is therefore critical to increasing patient well-being and potentially reducing 
morbidity and mortality. Despite its importance, a review of Medicare billing data has indicated that 
the ESRD population had a less than 50% immunization rate for the years 1997 to 1998 and 1998 
to 1999. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all persons aged 65 and older and persons in 
selected high-risk groups. (B recommendation) (USPSTF)  
 
Vaccination is recommended for the following persons who are at increased risk for complications 
from influenza: adults and children who have required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization 
during the preceding year because of chronic metabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus), 
renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression (including immunosuppression 
caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]); (CDC).

RATIONALE: 
Anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with kidney disease, increasing in likelihood as kidney 
function declines. The goal of this measure is to identify anemia and develop a treatment plan 
which is vital to “improve patient quality of life, to improve the various physiological abnormalities 
associated with anemia, to decrease morbidity, to decrease hospitalization, and to improve patient 
survival.” 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Hb testing should be carried out in all patients with CKD, regardless of stage or cause (Opinion). 
Hb levels should be measured at least annually (Opinion). In patients with CKD, Hb should be 11.0 
g/dL or greater (Moderately Strong Recommendation). (KDOQITM)

12/31/2007  
183
  
 
RATIONALE: 
Patients receiving hemodialysis must be monitored (by assessing Kt/V) regularly to ensure that 
their dialysis dose is sufficient. A patient receiving hemodialysis whose Kt/V level is less than 1.2 is 
not receiving optimal dialysis. This measure assesses whether the treating physician addressed 
the low Kt/V level. A plan of care (action defined as checking for adequacy of the AV access, 
increasing the blood flow, increasing the dialyzer size, or increasing the time of dialysis sessions) 
should be documented by the physician for every time Kt/V is less than 1.2. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Quantifying HD is the first step toward assessment of its adequacy. Fortunately, the intermittent 
rapid decrease in urea concentration during HD allows a relatively easy measurement of the dose. 
The delivered dose of HD should be measured at regular intervals no less than monthly(A). 
(KDOQITM ) 
 
The minimally adequate dose of HD given 3 times per week to patients with Kr less than 2 
mL/min/1.73 m2 should be an spKt/V (excluding RKF) of 1.2 per dialysis. For treatment times less 
than 5 hours, an alternative minimum dose is a URR of 65% (A). The target dose for HD given 3 
times per week with Kr less than 2 mL/min/1.73 m2 should be an spKt/V of 1.4 per dialysis not 
including RKF, or URR of 70% (A). (KDOQITM)

of months during the reporting period a patient is receiving peritoneal dialysis:  
• 1-4 months- report once during the reporting period 
• 5-8 months- report twice during the reporting period 
• 9-12 months- report three times during the reporting period 
It is anticipated that clinicians providing care for patients with ESRD will submit this measure. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT procedure codes, G-codes, and patient demographics (age, gender, 
etc.) are used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II 
codes are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT procedure codes, G-
codes, and the appropriate CPT Category II code(s) OR the CPT Category II code(s) with the 
modifier. The modifier allowed for this measure is: 8P- reasons not otherwise specified. There are 
no allowable performance exclusions for this measure. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients who have a Kt/V ≥1.7 OR have a Kt/V <1.7 with a documented plan of care for inadequate 
peritoneal dialysis at least three times during the 12 month reporting period

the number of exchanges per 24 hours) should be documented by the physician for every time Kt/V 
is less than 1.7. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Total solute clearance (residual kidney and peritoneal, in terms of Kt/Vurea) should be measured 
within the first month after initiating dialysis therapy and at least once every 4 months thereafter 
(B). (KDOQITM) 
 
For patients with residual kidney function (considered to be significant when urine volume is > 100 
mL/d): The minimal “delivered” dose of total small-solute clearance should be a total (peritoneal

RATIONALE: 
HCV RNA testing is needed to establish and confirm diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C. HCV is an 
RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. HCV replicates preferentially in hepatocytes but is not directly 
cytopathic, leading to persistent infection. During chronic infection, HCV RNA reaches high levels, 
generally ranging from 105 to 107 international units (IU)/mL, but the levels can fluctuate widely. 
However, within the same individual, RNA levels are usually relatively stable. (NIH) 
 
After initial exposure, HCV RNA can be detected in blood within 1 to 3 weeks and is present at the 
onset of symptoms.  
 
Antibodies to HCV are detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in only 50 to 70 percent of patients 
at the onset of symptoms, increasing to more than 90 percent after 3 months. 
 
The clinical utility of serial HCV viral levels in a patient is predicated on continued use of the same 
specific quantitative assay that was used in the initial determination of the viral level. While there is 
little correlation between disease severity or disease progression with the absolute level of HCV 
RNA, quantitative determination of the HCV level provides important information on the likelihood 
of response to treatment in patients undergoing antiviral therapy. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing should be performed in:  
a. patients with a positive anti-HCV test (Grade II-2); 
b. patients for whom antiviral treatment is being considered, using a quantitative assay 
(Grade II-2); 
c. patients with unexplained liver disease whose anti-HCV test is negative and who are 
immunocompromised or suspected of having acute HCV infection (Grade II-2). (AASLD) 
 
The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection is often suggested by abnormalities in ALT levels and 
is established by EIA followed by confirmatory determination of HCV RNA. (NIH)

RATIONALE: 
Establish baseline level against which to monitor virologic response and indicate likelihood of 
response. The clinical utility of serial HCV viral levels in a patient is predicated on continued use of 
the same specific quantitative assay that was used in the initial determination of the viral level. 
While there is little correlation between disease severity or disease progression with the absolute 
level of HCV RNA, quantitative determination of the HCV level provides important information on 
the likelihood of response to treatment in patients undergoing antiviral therapy. (NIH) 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
HCV RNA testing should be performed in patients with a positive anti-HCV test (Grade II-2), 
patients for whom antiviral treatment is being considered, using a quantitative assay (Grade II-2), 
patients with unexplained liver disease whose anti-HCV test is negative and patients who are 
immune compromised or suspected of having acute HCV infection (Grade II-2). AASLD) 
 
All candidates for antiviral therapy should be tested for HCV RNA with a quantitative amplification 
assay, which provides both a baseline level against which to monitor virologic response and a 
prognostic indicator of the likelihood of response. AGA) 
 
The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection is often suggested by abnormalities in ALT levels and 
is established by EIA followed by confirmatory determination of HCV RNA. NIH)

RATIONALE: 
To guide treatment decisions regarding duration of therapy and likelihood of response. There are 6 
HCV genotypes and more than 50 subtypes. These genotypes differ by as much as 31 to 34 
percent in their nucleotide sequences, whereas subtypes differ by 20 to 23 percent based on full-
length genomic sequence comparisons. Genotype determinations influence treatment decisions. 
Patients with genotypes 2 or 3 have better response rates to re-treatment than those with genotype 
1. (NIH) 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
HCV genotype should be determined in all HCV-infected persons prior to treatment in order to 
determine the duration of therapy and likelihood of response (Grade I). (AASLD) 
 
Information on the genotype of the virus is important to guide treatment decisions. Genotype 1, 
most commonly found in the United States, is less amenable to treatment than genotypes 2 or 3.

RATIONALE: 
Monitor effectiveness of antiviral therapy. An early virologic response (EVR), during the first 12 
weeks of therapy, is a valuable clinical milestone. In the absence of an EVR, the likelihood of an 
SVR is 0–3%. If the only goal of therapy is to achieve an SVR, therapy can be discontinued after 
12 weeks if an EVR is not achieved. Potentially, histologic benefit can accrue even in the absence 
of an SVR; therefore, some authorities treat beyond 12 weeks even in patients who have not 
achieved an EVR. For documentation of a virologic response at the end of therapy (end-of-
treatment response) or an SVR ≥ 6 months after completing therapy, a more sensitive quantitative 
assay with a lower limit of ≤ 50 IU/mL, if available, or a qualitative HCV RNA assay is 
recommended. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Baseline and 12-week monitoring of HCV RNA levels should be performed with the same 
quantitative amplification assay. An early virologic response (EVR), defined as a ≥ 2-log10 
reduction in HCV RNA levels during the first 12 weeks of therapy, is a valuable clinical milestone 
(Category I). (AGA) 
 
Clinical and virologic monitoring during therapy should be conducted at intervals ranging from once 
a month to once every 3 months. Frequent hematologic monitoring is necessary to identify marked 
anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone level is 
indicated to identify hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (Category I). (AGA)

RATIONALE: 
Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy. Therefore, counseling regarding strict precautions and 
contraception in women of childbearing age and their sexual partners and in HCV-infected men 
with female partners of childbearing age needs to be provided to those receiving treatment for 
chronic hepatitis C prior to the initiation of treatment. Although this measure is only captures data 
related to counseling prior to therapy it should be subsequently re-enforced during treatment and 
for a period of 6 months after treatment. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Because of the concern of birth defects from the use of ribavirin, it is imperative that persons who 
receive the drug use strict contraception methods both during treatment and for a period of 6 
months after treatment. (AASLD) 
 
Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy, necessitating strict precautions and contraception in 
women of childbearing age and their sexual partners and in HCV-infected men with female 
partners of childbearing age. (AGA)

99215, 99241, 99242, 99243, 99244, 99245 
 
RATIONALE: 
Despite their limited utility, many patients with AOE receive systemic antimicrobial therapy, often in 
addition to topical therapy. “There are no data on the efficacy of systemic therapy with the use of 
appropriate antibacterials and stratified by severity of the infection. Moreover, orally administered 
antibiotics have significant adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic 
reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance.” The use of 
systemic antimicrobial therapy to treat AOE should be limited only to those clinical situations in 
which it is indicated. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside the ear canal 
or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy.

Measure #98: Otitis Media with Effusion (OME): Systemic Corticosteroids – Avoidance of 
Inappropriate Use 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 2 months through 12 years with a diagnosis of OME who were not 
prescribed systemic corticosteroids 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported once for each occurrence of OME in children seen during the 
reporting period. Each unique occurrence is defined as a 90-day period from onset of OME. Claims 
data will be analyzed to determine unique occurrences. If multiple claims are submitted within that 
90-day period, only one instance of reporting will be counted. This measure may be reported by 
clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided 
and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are 
used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes 
are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate ICD-9 diagnosis codes, E/M service codes, 
and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The 
modifier allowed for this measure is: 1P- medical reasons. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients who were not prescribed systemic corticosteroids 
 
Numerator Instructions: For performance, the measure will be calculated as the number 
of patients for whom systemic corticosteroids were neither prescribed nor recommended 
over the number of patients in the denominator (patients aged 2 months through 12 years 
with a diagnosis of OME). A higher score indicates appropriate treatment of patients with 
OME (e.g., the proportion for whom systemic corticosteroids were not prescribed). 
 
Systemic Corticosteroids not Prescribed 
CPT II 4136F: Systemic corticosteroids not prescribed 
OR 
Systemic Corticosteroids Prescribed for Medical Reasons 
Append a modifier (1P) to CPT Category II code 4135F to report documented 
circumstances that appropriately exclude patients from the denominator. 
• 1P: Documentation of medical reason(s) for prescribing systemic corticosteroids

tumor), the pN category (regional lymph nodes), and the histologic grade  
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported each time a breast cancer resection surgical pathology examination 
is performed during the reporting period for breast cancer patients. It is anticipated that clinicians 
who examine breast tissue specimens following resection in a laboratory or institution will submit 
this measure.  
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes and CPT procedure codes are used to identify patients who are included in 
the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes are used to report the numerator of the 
measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT procedure

175.0, 175.9 
AND 
CPT procedure codes: 88307, 88309 
 
RATIONALE: 
Therapeutic decisions for breast cancer management are stage driven and cannot be made 
without a complete set of pathology descriptors. Incomplete cancer resection pathology reports 
may result in misclassification of patients, rework and delays, and suboptimal management. The 
College of American Pathologists (CAP) has produced evidence-based checklists of essential 
pathologic parameters that are recommended to be included in cancer resection pathology reports. 
These checklists have been endorsed as a voluntary standard by National Quality Forum (NQF) 
and are considered the reporting standard by the Commission on Cancer (CoC) of the American 
College of Surgeons (ACS). 
 
The CAP recently conducted a structured audit of breast cancer pathology report adequacy at 86 
institutions. Overall, 35% of eligible reports were missing at least one of the ten CAP-
recommended breast cancer elements. Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) conducted a similar study in 
2005 and found that 25% of breast cancer pathology reports did not include all of the information 
required by the CAP standards.  
 
While the exact percentage of breast cancer resection pathology reports that are missing the pT 
category, the pN category and the histologic grade is unknown, these are essential elements in 
breast cancer treatment decisions and should be included in every pathology report when possible.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Patient management and treatment guidelines promote an organized approach to providing quality 
care. The (American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer) CoC requires that 90% of 
pathology reports that include a cancer diagnosis contain the scientifically validated data elements 
outlined in the surgical case summary checklist of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) 
publication Reporting on Cancer Specimens. (ACSCoC)   
 
All invasive breast carcinomas, with the exception of medullary carcinoma should be graded. The 
grading system used must be specified in the report; the Nottingham combined histologic grade 
(Elston-Ellis modification of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading system) is recommended. Within 
each stage grouping there is a relation between histologic grade and outcome. (CAP)

Surgical resection is the primary therapy for most colorectal carcinomas, and the most important 
prognostic indicators are related to the pathologic findings in the resection specimen. The anatomic 
extent of disease is by far the most important prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. Pathologic 
staging depends on pathologic documentation of the anatomic extent of disease, whether or not 
the primary tumor has been completely removed. If a biopsied tumor is not resected for any reason  
 
 
 
 
 
12/31/2007  
230
  
 
(e.g., when technically unfeasible) and if the highest T and N categories or the M1 category of the 
tumor can be confirmed microscopically, the criteria for pathologic classification and staging have 
been satisfied without total removal of the primary cancer.(CAP)

RATIONALE: 
The initial assessment of all prostate cancer patients should include the three evaluations required 
in this measure.   
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Tumor characteristics, including PSA level and changes such as velocity and doubling time, 
Gleason score, and tumor stage, are predictive of cancer outcomes. Using PSA, Gleason score, 
and tumor stage, risk strata have been defined that are significantly associated with PSA 
recurrence and cancer specific mortality. (AUA) 
 
The combination of Gleason score, PSA level, and stage can effectively stratify patients into 
categories associated with different probabilities of achieving a cure. In addition to considering the 
probability of cure, the choice of initial treatment is highly influenced by estimated life expectancy, 
comorbidities, potential therapy side effects, and patient preference. (NCCN)

RATIONALE: 
A bone scan is generally not required for staging prostate cancer in men with a low risk of 
recurrence. This measure is written as a negative measure so that the performance goal is 100%, 
consistent with the other measures for this condition.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Routine use of a bone scan is not required for staging asymptomatic men with clinically localized 
prostate cancer when their PSA is equal to or less than 20.0 ng/mL. (AUA) 
 
Patients with a life expectancy > 5 years or symptomatic: 
• 
A bone scan is appropriate for T1 to T2 disease in the presence of a PSA greater than 20 
ng/mL, Gleason score of 8 or higher, clinical stage of T3 to T4, or symptomatic disease.  
• 
Patients at higher risk of metastatic disease may undergo pelvic computed tomography (CT) 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with possible fine-needle aspiration of 
enlarged lymph nodes or staging lymph node dissection. Nomograms or risk tables may be 
used to identify patients with a higher likelihood of having metastatic disease. If the 
nomogram indicates a probability of lymph node involvement greater than 20% or if the 
patient is stage T3 or T4, this is recommended as a threshold for doing a staging CT scan or 
MRI evaluation.    
 
For all other patients, no additional imaging is required for staging. (NCCN) (Category 2A)

RATIONALE: 
Current, computer-aided radiotherapy techniques improve the precision of the irradiation of 
cancerous tissue and should be employed for all patients receiving external beam radiotherapy to 
the prostate.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Three-dimensional CRT or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques should be 
employed over conventional techniques. These techniques use computer software to integrate CT 
images of the patients' internal anatomy in the treatment position, which allows the volume 
receiving the high radiation dose to "conform" more exactly to the shape of the tumor. Three-
dimensional CRT has reduced both acute and late normal tissue toxicity in patients with prostate 
cancer and allows higher cumulative doses to be delivered with a lower risk of late effects. (NCCN)

RATIONALE: 
Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions comprise the leading cause of disability among adults in 
the United States, and the cost of this public health burden is expected to increase as the U.S. 
population ages. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 1 percent of the adult population. Although the 
course of RA in individual patients is highly variable, most patients with persistent RA develop 
progressive functional limitation and physical disability. In addition, there is excess mortality and 
decreased survival among patients with persistent RA compared with the general population. While 
the prevalence of RA is low, the associated costs are very high over the lifetime of the affected 
person. Costs of RA amount to approximately 1 percent of the U.S. Gross National Product. 
 
RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder often characterized by progressive joint destruction and 
multi-system involvement. RA affects approximately 2.5 million Americans, disproportionately 
women. There is no cure; consequently, the goal of treatment is to slow the progression of disease, 
thereby delaying or preventing joint destruction, relieving pain and maintaining functional capacity. 
RA pain is often most effectively managed in the long term by altering the natural history of the 
active progressive disease with DMARDs, but analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs also have an 
important place in pain management.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
RA should be treated as early as possible with DMARDs to control symptoms and delay disease 
progression.  
Good Practice Point: All patients with persistent inflammatory joint disease (> 6–8 weeks duration) 
already receiving simple analgesics and NSAIDs should be considered for referral for specialist 
rheumatology opinion and DMARD therapy, preferably within 12 weeks.  
Early DMARD therapy in RA is important to maintain function and reduce later disability.  
DMARD therapy should be sustained in inflammatory disease in order to maintain disease 
suppression.

American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Subcommittee on Rheumatoid Arthritis Guidelines: 
Guidelines for the Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The majority of patients with newly 
diagnosed RA should be started on DMARD therapy within three months of diagnosis. All patients 
with RA are candidates for DMARD therapy. Although NSAIDs and glucocorticoids may alleviate 
symptoms, joint damage may continue to occur and progress.  
Initiation of DMARD therapy should not be delayed beyond three months for any patient with an 
established diagnosis who, despite adequate treatment with NSAIDs, has ongoing joint pain, 
significant morning stiffness or fatigue, active synovitis, persistent elevation of the ESR or CRP 
level or radiographic joint damage. For any untreated patient with persistent synovitis and joint 
damage, DMARD treatment should be started promptly to prevent or slow further damage.  
(ACR: Wherever possible, guidelines are evidence-based. However, because significant gaps in 
knowledge still exist, some recommendations are based on best practices and a consensus of the 
committee.)

Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis: 2002 Update. Arthritis Rheum. 2002;46:328-346. 
 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network: Management of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
There is clear evidence from placebo-controlled trials that DMARDs reduce symptoms in RA (as 
measured by joint pain, swelling and tenderness, and duration and severity of morning stiffness). 
DMARDs also improve global well being, as assessed by both patients and physicians. It is 
becoming increasingly clear that DMARDs should be introduced as soon as possible. Protracted 
benefit may be achieved in RA patients if appropriate DMARD therapy is introduced early.

RATIONALE: 
Osteoarthritis can be a debilitating condition. An assessment of patient symptoms and functional 
status is important as it serves as the basis for making treatment modifications, which in turn, 
assists in improving the patient’s quality of life. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Because pain is a major cause of disability in people with arthritis, assessment of functional status 
should be included in the pain assessment. When selecting a functional status measure, 
consideration should be given to the cognitive-developmental abilities of the person, the type of 
practice setting, the domains of function to be assessed, and the time and resources needed to 
complete the assessment. (APS; B Recommendation) 
 
Any persistent pain that has an impact on physical function, psychosocial function, or other aspects 
of quality of life should be recognized as a significant problem. (AGA; IIA Recommendation) 
 
Control of pain and maintenance of activity correlate well with satisfactory quality of life. (AAOS)

99348, 99349, 99350, 99356, 99357 
 
RATIONALE: 
The elderly have a much higher mortality from community-acquired pneumonia due to increased 
risk factors such as comorbidities, an increase in the number of medications taken and 
weaknesses or disease of lung tissue. Pneumonia accounts for an estimated 20 percent of 
nosocomial infections among the elderly, second only to urinary tract infections. The disease 
burden is large for older adults and the potential for prevention is high. (Ely, E., 1997) 
 
Drugs such as penicillin were once effective in treating these infections; but the disease has 
become more resistant, making treatment of pneumococcal infections more difficult. This makes 
prevention of the disease through vaccination even more important. (CDC. National Immunization 
Program—Pneumococcal Disease., 2005) 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force’s Guide to Clinical Preventive Services recommends 
pneumococcal vaccine for all immunocompetent individuals who are 65 and older or otherwise at 
increased risk for pneumococcal disease. Routine revaccination is not recommended, but may be 
appropriate in immunocompetent individuals at high risk for morbidity and mortality from 
pneumococcal disease (e.g., persons ≥ 75 years of age or with severe chronic disease) who were 
vaccinated more than five years previously. Medicare Part B fully covers the cost of the vaccine 
and its administration every five years. (United States Preventive Services Task Force, 1998) 
Pneumococcal infection is a common cause of illness and death in the elderly and persons with 
certain underlying conditions. In 1998, an estimated 3,400 adults aged ≥ 65 years died as a result 
of invasive pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal infection accounts for more deaths than any 
other vaccine-preventable bacterial disease. (CDC, 2002; Pneumococcal Pneumonia, NIAID Fact 
Sheet, December 2004.) 
 
One of the Healthy People 2010 objectives is to increase pneumococcal immunization levels for 
the non-institutionalized, high-risk populations to at least 90 percent (objective no. 14.29). While 
the percent of persons 65 years and older receiving the pneumococcal vaccine has increased, it 
still remains considerably below the Health People 2010 objective. According to the National 
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which is used to track performance on year 2010 objectives, in 
1998 only 46 percent of adults age 65 years and older report receiving the vaccine. The figure was 
45 percent based on the 1997 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. 
(National Center for Health Statistics., 2005; CDC, 1997)

A particular strength of this measure is that it provides an opportunity to compare performance 
against national, state and/or regional benchmarks, which are collected through nationally 
organized and administered surveys.  
 
At the physician practice level where a patient survey may not be feasible, data collection on 
pneumonia vaccination status through chart abstraction is a viable option.

RATIONALE: 
Breast cancer ranks as the second leading cause of death in women. For women 40 to 49 years of 
age mammography can reduce mortality by 17 percent. (AMA, 2003) 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT: 
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening mammography, with 
or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1-2 years for women aged 40 and older. 
(USPSTF, 2002) 
 
• The USPSTF found fair evidence that mammography screening every 12-33 months 
significantly reduces mortality from breast cancer. Evidence is strongest for women aged 
50-69, the age group generally included in screening trials. (USPSTF, 2002) 
• For women aged 40-49, the evidence that screening mammography reduces mortality 
from breast cancer is weaker, and the absolute benefit of mammography is smaller, than it 
is for older women. Most, but not all, studies indicate a mortality benefit for women 
undergoing mammography at ages 40-49, but the delay in observed benefit in women 
younger than 50 makes it difficult to determine the incremental benefit of beginning 
screening at age 40 rather than at age 50. (USPSTF, 2002) 
• The absolute benefit is smaller because the incidence of breast cancer is lower among 
women in their 40s than it is among older women. (USPSTF, 2002) 
 
The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is also generalizable to women aged 70 and older (who 
face a higher absolute risk for breast cancer) if their life expectancy is not compromised by 
comorbid disease. The absolute probability of benefits of regular mammography increases along a 
continuum with age, whereas the likelihood of harms from screening (false-positive results and 
unnecessary anxiety, biopsies, and cost) diminishes from ages 40-70. The balance of benefits and 
potential harms, therefore, grows more favorable as women age. The precise age at which the 
potential benefits of mammography justify the possible harms is a subjective choice. (USPSTF, 
2002) 
 
American Cancer Society: Yearly Mammograms starting at age 40 and continuing for as long as a 
woman is in good health. (Smith, 2003) 
 
American College of Preventative Medicine (ACPM): 
 
• Low-risk women (no family history, familial cancer syndrome, or prior cancer). There is 
inadequate evidence for or against mammography screening of women under the age of 
50. Women between the ages of 50-69 should have annual or biennial, high-quality, two-
 
 
12/31/2007  
263
  
 
view mammography. Women aged 70 and older should continue undergoing 
mammography screening provided their health status permits breast cancer treatment. 
(Ferrini, 1996) 
• Higher-risk women: Women with a family history of pre-menopausal breast cancer in a 
first-degree relative or those with a history of breast and/or gynecologic cancer may 
warrant more aggressive screening. Women with these histories often begin screening at 
an earlier age, although there is no direct evidence of effectiveness to support this 
practice. The future availability of genetic screening may define new recommendations for 
screening high-risk women. (Ferrini, 1996) 
 
The American Medical Association (AMA), the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American College of Radiology (ACR), all support screening with 
mammography and CBE beginning at age 40. (AMA, 1999; ACOG, 2000; Feig, 1998) 
 
The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), and the American Academy of 
Family Physicians (AAFP), recommends beginning mammography for average-risk women at age 
50. (Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination, 1999; AAFP, 2005) 
AAFP recommends that mammography in high-risk women begin at age 40, and recommends that 
all women aged 40-49 be counseled about the risks and benefits of mammography before making 
decisions about screening. (AAFP, 2005)

RATIONALE: 
Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. There 
were an estimated 135,400 new cases and 56,700 deaths from the disease during 2001. 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) places significant economic burden on the society as well with treatment 
costs over $6.5 billion per year and, among malignancies, is second only to breast cancer at $6.6 
billion per year (Schrag, 1999). 
 
Colorectal cancer screening can detect pre-malignant polyps and early stage cancers. Unlike other 
screening tests that only detect disease, colorectal cancer screening can guide removal of pre-
malignant polyps, which in theory can prevent development of colon cancer. Four tests are 
currently available for screening: fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, 
colonoscopy, and double contrast barium enema. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
During the past decade, compelling evidence has accumulated that systematic screening of the 
population can reduce mortality from colorectal cancer. Three randomized, controlled trials 
demonstrated that fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), followed by complete diagnostic evaluation of 
the colon for a positive test, reduced colorectal cancer mortality (Hardcastle et al., 1996; Mandel & 
Oken, 1998; Kronborg; 1996). One of these randomized trials (Mandel et al., 1993) compared 
annual FOBT screening to biennial FOBT screening, and found that annual screening resulted in 
greater reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. Two case control studies have provided evidence 
that sigmoidoscopy reduces colorectal cancer mortality (Selby et al., 1992; Newcomb et al., 1992). 
Approximately 75% of all colorectal cancers arise sporadically (Stephenson et al., 1991). Part of 
the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening is mediated by the removal of the precursor 
lesion—an adenomatous polyp (Vogtelstein et al., 1988). It has been shown that removal of polyps 
in a population can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer (Winawer, 1993). Colorectal 
screening may also lower mortality by allowing detection of cancer at earlier stages, when 
treatment is more effective (Kavanaugh, 1998).  
 
 
Because of the accumulated evidence, broad consensus has emerged about the virtue of 
screening individuals aged 50 years or older for colorectal cancer. In 1996, the U.S. Preventive 
 
 
12/31/2007  
266
  
 
Services Task Force (USPSTF) published guidelines that recommended screening all persons 
aged 50 and older for colorectal cancer by annual FOBT or sigmoidoscopy (at unspecified 
periodicity) or both (USPSTF, 1997). In February 1997, clinical practice recommendations were 
issued by an interdisciplinary task force originally convened by the Agency for Health Care Policy 
and Research (AHCPR; the agency has since been renamed the Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality) and supported by a consortium of professional organizations including the American 
Gastroenterological Association (Winawer, 1997). The American Cancer Society (ACS) has 
recommended screening for colorectal cancer since 1980 and recently updated its guidelines in 
January, 2002 (Smith et al., 2002). These updated guidelines recommend colorectal cancer 
screening starting at age 50 for all persons at average risk of developing colorectal cancer using 
one of five options for screening: (1) annual FOBT; (2) flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years; (3) 
annual FOBT plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years; (4) double contrast barium enema 
(DCBE) every five years; or (5) colonoscopy every 10 years.   
 
The USPSTF released its updated recommendations for colorectal cancer screening in July 2002. 
The USPSTF strongly recommends that clinicians screen men and women 50 years of age or older 
for colorectal cancer (A recommendation). The USPSTF found good evidence for FOBT screening, 
fair evidence for sigmoidoscopy (alone or in combination with FOBT), and no direct evidence for 
colonoscopy or double contrast barium enema. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to 
recommend new technologies, such as virtual colonoscopy. The recommended periodicity is 
annually for FOBT, every 5 years for sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium enema, and every 
10 years for colonoscopy. FOBT is the only test for which direct evidence on periodicity exists. The 
intervals for the other tests are based on their sensitivity and the natural course of the disease.

RATIONALE: 
Interventions to control smoking are strategically important because smoking is the leading 
preventable cause of death in the United States, clinical interventions are known to be effective in 
increasing cessation rates, and quitting smoking has been shown to improve health outcomes 
(Fiore, 2000) 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The Clinical Practice Guidelines: Treating tobacco use and dependence published by USDHHS 
Public Health Service (Fiore, 2002) provide convincing empirical support for providing advice to 
and assistance with quitting smoking for patients who smoke. Specifically, these guidelines 
recommend:  
1) repeated advice and support at all or most visits, and  
2) delivery of cessation assistance and follow-up at all or most visits. 
 
There have been more than 12 million premature deaths attributable to smoking since the first 
published Surgeon General’s report on smoking and health in 1964. Smoking remains the leading 
preventable cause of premature death in the United States. 
 
Nearly every organ in the body is affected by smoking (USDHHS, 2004). Smoking causes many 
diseases and reduces the health of smokers in general. The list of diseases caused by smoking 
has been expanded to include abdominal aortic aneurysm, acute myeloid leukemia, cataract, 
cervical cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, pneumonia, periodontitis, and stomach cancer 
(USDHHS, 2004). 
In the US in 2003, 45.4 million adults (21.6 percent) were current smokers—24.1 percent of men 
and 19.2 percent of women (CDC, 2005a). An estimated 70% of these smokers said they wanted 
to quit (CDC, 2005a).  
 
An estimated 45.9 million adults were former smokers in 2003, representing 50.3 percent of those 
who had ever smoked (CDC, 2005a). For the second consecutive year, more adults had quit than 
were still smoking. A large number of clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 
counseling in increasing cessation rates, and the effectiveness of bupropion and NRT has been 
 
 
12/31/2007  
271
  
 
demonstrated (Fiore, 2000). A meta-analysis of 7 studies found that physician advice to quit is 
associated with a 30% increase in cessation rates (Fiore, 2000). Counseling and medication are 
each associated with a doubling of cessation rates (Fiore, 2000).

Measure #116: Inappropriate Antibiotic Treatment for Adults with Acute Bronchitis 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of adults aged 18 through 64 years with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis who were not 
prescribed or dispensed an antibiotic prescription on or within 3 days of the initial date of service 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported at each visit for acute bronchitis during the reporting period. This 
measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure 
based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using CPT Category II codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are 
used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. CPT Category II codes 
are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the listed ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, 
and the appropriate CPT Category II code OR the CPT Category II code with the modifier. The 
modifier allowed for this measure is: 1P- medical reasons. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients who were not prescribed or dispensed antibiotics on or within 3 days of the initial date of 
service 
 
Numerator Instructions: For performance, the measure will be calculated as the number 
of patients for whom antibiotics were neither prescribed nor dispensed on or within 3 days 
of the initial date of service over the number of patients in the denominator (patients aged 
18 through 64 years with acute bronchitis). A higher score indicates appropriate treatment 
of patients with acute bronchitis (e.g., the proportion for whom antibiotics were not 
prescribed or dispensed on or three days after the initial date of service).

RATIONALE: 
Antibiotics are commonly misused and overused for a number of viral respiratory conditions where 
antibiotic treatment is not clinically indicated. (Scott J.G., D. Cohen, B. Dicicco-Bloom, 2001) About 
80 percent of antibiotics prescribed for acute respiratory infections in adults are unnecessary, 
according to CDC prevention guidelines. In adults, antibiotics are most often (65–80 percent) 
prescribed for acute bronchitis, despite its viral origin. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics 
contributes to antibiotic drug resistance, which is of public health concern due to the diminished 
efficacy of antibiotics against bacterial infections, particularly in sick patients and the elderly. 
(Austin D.J., K.G. Kristinsson, R.M. Anderson, 1999, Patterson, JE, 2001, Cohen ML, 1992, 
Lipsitch M, 2001) 
 
A HEDIS measure that highlights inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in adults for a common 
respiratory condition will help to raise awareness among clinicians and patients about inappropriate 
antibiotic use. Antibiotics are most often inappropriately prescribed in adults with acute bronchitis. 
This measure builds on an existing HEDIS measure targeting inappropriate antibiotic prescribing 
for children with upper respiratory infection (common cold), where antibiotics are also most often 
inappropriately prescribed. (Chandran R., 2001, Gonzales R., J.F. Steiner, et al., 1999) 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Clinical guidelines do not support antibiotic treatment of otherwise healthy adults with acute 
bronchitis due to the viral origin of acute bronchitis. Patients with chronic bronchitis, COPD or other 
chronic comorbidity may be treated with antibiotics and are therefore excluded from the measure 
denominator. (Gonzales R., D.C. Malone, J.H. Maselli, et al, 2001)

RATIONALE: 
Examination of the eyes is the first step in the treatment of any existing or developing conditions 
related to retinopathy and the first step in the prevention of blindness. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENCATION STATEMENTS: 
AACE/ACE, ADA, and American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO): Recommend that a dilated 
eye examination be performed on patients with diabetes during an initial assessment and at least 
annually thereafter. (AACE/ACE, 2002; ADA, 2004; AAO, 1998; Hammond, 1998) 
 
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology 
(AACE/ACE): Recommend that the annual eye examination be performed as part of a retinal 
module. The module includes test of visual acuity (Snellen chart); funduscopic examination and 
intraocular pressure (IOP) test. The AACE/ACE recommends that diabetic patients should be 
under the care of an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinopathy. 
AACE/ACE further believes that a dilated eye exam should only be done by an MD/DO. 
(AACE/ACE, 2002) 
 
American Diabetes Association (ADA): Patients with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated 
and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 3-5 years after 
the onset of diabetes. In general evaluation for diabetic eye disease is not necessary before 10 
years of age. However, some evidence suggests that the prepubertal duration of diabetes may be 
important in the development of microvascular complications; therefore, clinical judgment should 
be used when applying these recommendations to individual patients. (Level of Evidence: B) 
 
 
12/31/2007  
277
  
 
Patients with type 2 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by 
an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after diabetes diagnosis. (Level of Evidence: B) 
 
Subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients should be repeated annually by 
an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is knowledgeable and experienced in diagnosing the 
presence of diabetic retinopathy and is aware of its management. Examination will be required 
more frequently if retinopathy is progressing. This follow-up interval is recommended recognizing 
that there are limited data addressing this issue. (Level of Evidence: B) 
 
Seven standard field stereoscopic 30° fundus photography is an accepted method for examining 
diabetic retinopathy. (ADA, 2004) 
 
American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO): Recommends that diabetic patients should be under 
the care of an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinopathy. 
Ophthalmologists with specialized knowledge and experience in managing the disease are best 
able to detect and treat serious disease. Stereoscopic photographs offer an advantage over 
nonstereoscopic photographs, and the traditional “seven stereo fields” provide the most complete 
coverage. (AAO, 1998; Hammond, 1996) 
 
American Geriatrics Society (AGS): Dilated eye examinations should be performed every two years 
at a minimum, and more often if there are additional risk factors for diabetic eye disease or 
evidence of age-related eye disease. (CHF/AGS, 2003)

Measure #118: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACE) or Angiotensin Receptor 
Blocker (ARB) Therapy for Patients with Coronary Artery Disease and Diabetes and/or Left 
Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD) 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) 
who also have diabetes mellitus and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) who were 
prescribed ACE Inhibitor or ARB therapy 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:  
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for all patients with CAD 
seen during the reporting period. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the 
quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific 
denominator coding. 
 
There are two reporting options for this measure: 
(1) Patients who are 18 years and older with a diagnosis of CAD who also have LVSD who 
are prescribed ACE Inhibitor or ARB therapy  
OR 
(2) Patients who are 18 years and older with a diagnosis of CAD who are also diabetic who 
are prescribed ACE Inhibitor or ARB therapy.  
 
This measure is reported using G-codes: 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT E/M service codes, and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are 
used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. G-codes are used to 
report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate denominator code(s) and the appropriate 
numerator G-code.

99245, 99455, 99456 
 
RATIONALE: 
Nephropathy is a frequent complication of renal disease for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and 
often ends in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (ADA, 2002). Of all people with diabetes, 10-21% 
have nephropathy (ADA 2002). 
 
CLINICAL RECOMENNDATION STATEMENTS: 
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology 
(AACE/ACE): Recommends that the initial assessment should include a urinalysis, test for 
microalbuminuria and creatinine clearance. The renal complication module should be performed 
annually and includes a test for microalbuminuria and creatinine clearance (AACE/ACE, 2002). 
 
American Diabetes Association (ADA): A test for the presence of microalbumin should be 
performed at diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Microalbuminuria rarely occurs with short 
duration of type 1 diabetes; therefore, screening in individuals with type 1 diabetes should begin 
after 5 years' disease duration (Level of Evidence: E). However, some evidence suggests that the 
prepubertal duration of diabetes may be important in the development of microvascular 
complications; therefore, clinical judgment should be exercised when individualizing these 
recommendations. Because of the difficulty in precise dating of the onset of type 2 diabetes, such 
screening should begin at the time of diagnosis. After the initial screening and in the absence of 
previously demonstrated microalbuminuria, a test for the presence of microalbumin should be 
performed annually (ADA, 2004). 
 
Screening for microalbuminuria can be performed by three methods: 
 
 
12/31/2007  
284
  
 
1) 
measurement of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in a random spot collection  
2) 
24-h collection with creatinine, allowing the simultaneous measurement of creatinine clearance  
3) 
timed (e. g. 4-h or overnight) collection – the analysis of a spot sample for the albumin-to-
creatinine ratio is strongly recommended. 
 
The role of annual microalbuminuria assessment is less clear after diagnosis of microalbuminuria 
and institution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker 
(ARB) therapy and blood pressure control. Many experts recommend continued surveillance to 
assess both response to therapy and progression of disease. 
 
National Kidney Foundation (NKF): Individuals at increased risk, but found not to have chronic 
kidney disease, should be advised to follow a program of risk factor reduction, if appropriate, and 
undergo repeat periodic evaluation (NKF, 2003). 
 
A comparative analysis of recommendations and evidence in diabetes guidelines from 13 countries 
(including the American Diabetes Association and Canadian Medical Association) found there was 
agreement among the guidelines that ACE inhibitors should be recommended to patients with 
hypertension and renal disease (Burgers, 2002). 
 
The ADA also recommends that for the treatment of both micro- and macroalbuminurua, ARBs 
should be used except during pregnancy (ADA, 2005).

disease (CKD) (stage 4 or 5, not receiving Renal Replacement Therapy [RRT]), and hypertension 
and proteinuria who were prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin 
receptor blocker (ARB) therapy during the 12-month reporting period 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:  
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients with CKD seen 
during the reporting period. It is anticipated that clinicians providing care for patients with CKD will 
submit this measure.

RATIONALE: 
Evidence has shown that use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs as antihypertensive therapy is effective, 
and may help slow the progression of CKD. These drugs help control hypertension and decrease 
proteinuria. However, data shows that only approximately one-third of patients with CKD are 
treated with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB. 
 
Process/goal of care to be improved: Percentage of pts on ACEI or ARB and thereby slowing 
progression of CKD.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
If a patient has GFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m² and hypertension, then s/he should receive an ACE 
inhibitor or an ARB as a first-line agent (Grade C). (RPA 2002)  
 
ACE inhibitors and ARBs can be used safely in most patients with CKD. ACE Inhibitors and ARBs 
should be used at moderate to high doses, as used in clinical trials (Grade A). (NKF 2004)  
 
ACE inhibitors and ARBs have not been tested in all types of CKD. Where tested, ACE inhibitors 
and ARBs have generally similar effects on blood pressure, urine protein excretion, and slowing 
the progression of kidney disease (Strength of Recommendation: STRONG). (NKF 2004)

RATIONALE: 
Bone disease is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Patients with CKD should be 
monitored for calcium and phosphate imbalances and secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
Disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism are prevalent in CKD and are an important cause of 
morbidity, decrease in quality of life, and extraskeletal calcification that has been associated with 
increased CV mortality (taken verbatim from Definition, evaluation, and classification of renal 
osteodystrophy: a position statement from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 
(KDIGO), Moe, et al, Kidney Int, 2006; 69:1945-53). Gaps: USRDS 2006 data show that less than 
30% of Medicare (and less than 20% of EGHP) pts receive Ca, Phos, PTH measures within a year.  
 
Process/goal of care to be improved: identification of abnormalities mineral and bone metabolism 
that relate to increased morbidity and mortality. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and intact plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) should be 
measured in all patients with CKD and GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m². (Evidence) (NKF 2003)  
 
If a patient has GFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m², then s/he should have his/her serum calcium and 
phosphorus measured at least every three months, and iPTH levels measured at least once. 
(Grade B) (RPA 2002)  
 
Patients with CKD should be considered in the “highest-risk” group for CVD for implementing 
recommendations for pharmacological therapy, irrespective of cause of CKD. (Grade A) (NKF 
2004)  
 
All adults and adolescents with CKD should be evaluated for dyslipidemias. (Grade B) (NKF 2003)

RATIONALE: 
Identification of hypertension in patients with CKD is an essential part of management of the 
disease. Hypertension is common in patients with CKD, and if hypertension is left untreated, it will 
speed the progression of the disease. Recent research has shown that during office visits, 
approximately 20% to 30% of CKD patients do not have their blood pressure measured. 
Additionally, if the CKD patient is has an anemia/ESA visit, they are even less likely to have their 
blood pressure measured. In these patients, recent research has shown that 75% do not have their 
blood pressure measured at an anemia/ESA visit. Patients with CKD should have their blood 
pressure measured at each office visit so that changes can be identified and treatment initiated as 
soon as it is necessary. Blood pressure control is important in slowing the progression of chronic 
kidney disease. By slowing the progression of the disease, quality of life is improved for the patient, 
and it results in a longer period of time before a patient requires renal replacement therapy.  
Patients with chronic kidney disease should have a lower target blood pressure (< 130/80) than 
other patients with hypertension.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Blood pressure should be measured at each health encounter. (Grade A) (NKF 2004)  
 
If a patient has GFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m2, then his/her blood pressure should be checked with 
every clinic visit. (Grade A) (RPA 2002)  
If a patient has a GFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m², and if blood pressure is determined to be elevated 
(systolic > 130 mmHg OR diastolic > 80 mmHg), then s/he should receive intensified 
antihypertensive therapy (Grade B). (RPA, 2002)  
 
Patients with CKD should be considered in the “highest-risk” group for CVD for implementing 
recommendations for pharmacological therapy, irrespective of cause of CKD (Grade A). (NKF, 
2004)  
 
Target blood pressure for CVD risk reduction in CKD and diabetic/nondiabetic kidney disease 
should be < 130/80 mmHg (Grade B). (NKF, 2004)

(stage 4 or 5, not receiving RRT), receiving ESA therapy 
 
Denominator Coding: 
An ICD-9 diagnosis code for CKD and a CPT E/M service code are required to identify 
patients for denominator inclusion.  
ICD-9 diagnosis codes: 585.4, 585.5 
AND 
CPT E/M service codes: 99201, 99202, 99203, 99204, 99205, 99212, 99213, 99214, 
99215, 99241, 99242, 99243, 99244, 99245 
 
RATIONALE: 
The clinical recommendation regarding Hb levels for CKD patients receiving ESA therapy is that 
Hb level should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL. Additionally, these patients should 
also have their Hb level checked at least monthly. Given that Hb levels vary for each patient due to 
numerous factors, it is necessary to monitor Hb level closely in order to make the individualized 
treatment decisions required in maintaining Hb level in the target range. There is no evidence of 
benefit from ESA therapy when Hb levels are maintained at greater than 13.0 g/dL. Maintaining Hb 
at higher levels may result in potential harm to the patient, as well as incur unjustified cost. 
Evidence linking increased risks for patients with CKD and higher Hb levels were for target Hb 
levels greater than 13.0g/dL (CHOIR/CREATE). The intention of this measure is not to suggest that 
the goal of ESA treatment is to reach an achieved Hb of 13.0 g/dL. Rather, as a patient safety 
measures, it is to realize that patients who reach Hb levels higher than 13.0 g/dL are at increased 
risk for adverse events, and that these elevated Hb levels need to be addressed by adjusting ESA 
dosage. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The frequency of HB monitoring in patients treated with ESAs should be at least monthly. (Opinion) 
(NKF 2006) 
 
The Hb target is the intended aim of ESA therapy for the individual patient with CKD. In clinical 
practice, achieved Hb results vary considerably from Hb target. 
• Selection of the Hb target and selection of the Hb level at which ESA therapy is initiated 
in the individual patient should include consideration of potential benefits (including 
improvement in the quality of life and avoidance of transfusion) and potential harms 
(including the risk of life-threatening adverse events). (Clinical Practice 
Recommendation) (NKF 2007) 
• In dialysis and nondialysis patients with CKD receiving ESA therapy, the selected Hb 
target should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL. (Clinical Practice 
Recommendation) (NKF 2007)  
 
 
12/31/2007  
296
  
 
• In dialysis and nondialysis patients with CKD receiving ESA therapy, the Hb target 
should not be greater than 13.0 g/dL. (Clinical Practice Guideline; Moderately Strong 
Evidence) (NKF, 2007)  
 
The initial ESA dose and the ESA dose adjustments should be determined by the patient’s Hb 
level, the target Hb level, the observed rate of increase in Hb level, and clinical circumstances. 
(Opinion) (NKF 2006)  
 
ESA doses should be decreased, but not necessarily held, when a downward adjustment of Hb 
level is needed. (Opinion) (NKF 2006)

Measure #124: HIT - Adoption/Use of Health Information Technology (Electronic Health 
Records) 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Documents whether provider has adopted and is using health information technology. To qualify, 
the provider must have adopted a qualified electronic medical record (EMR). For the purpose of 
this measure, a qualified EMR can either be a Certification Commission for Healthcare Information 
Technology (CCHIT) certified EMR or, if not CCHIT certified, the system must be capable of all of 
the following: 
• Generating a medication list 
• Generating a problem list 
• Entering laboratory tests as discrete searchable data elements

This measure is to be reported at each visit occurring during the reporting period for patients seen 
during the reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may 
be reported by clinicians who have adopted and are using health information technology. 
 
This measure is reported using G-codes: 
CPT E/M codes, CPT service codes, CPT procedure codes, HCPCS D-codes and HCPCS G-
codes are used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. G-codes are 
used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate denominator code(s) and the appropriate 
numerator G-code.

RATIONALE: 
The need for clinical information systems to provide high-quality, safe care is a well recognized 
fact, as publicized by Dr. Ed Wagner in his Chronic Care Model. A comprehensive clinical 
information system can enhance the care of individual patients by: 
• Providing timely reminders about needed services 
• Summarizing data to track and plan care 
• Identifying groups of patients needing additional care 
• Facilitating performance monitoring and quality improvement efforts 
 
While it is preferable to encourage adoption of CCHIT certified EMRs, it became apparent during 
measure field testing that CCHIT certified EMRs are not currently available for all provider settings 
and specialty groups that may report this measure. Therefore, additional numerator coding was 
added to enable providers who have adopted a non-CCHIT certified product, which meets a set of 
standards, to also report this measure. The following is an excerpt taken from the CCHIT website: 
 
The 2006 Ambulatory EHR Criteria represent basic requirements that the Commission and its 
Workgroups believe are appropriate for many common ambulatory care settings. CCHIT 
acknowledges that these Criteria may not be suitable for settings such as behavioral health, 
emergency departments, or specialty practices and our current certification makes no 
representation for these. Purchasers should not interpret a lack of CCHIT Certification as being of 
significance for specialties and domains not yet addressed by CCHIT Criteria.

This report explains the difficulty managing a patient’s care using a written medical record, 
which can be cumbersome to navigate through, as well as illegible. Not only would an 
EMR be consistent and legible, it can provide reminders and prompts, allowing better 
management of patient care. In addition, patients who can access their provider using e-

RATIONALE: 
Automation of the ambulatory prescribing process has many potential benefits including:  
• Patient safety through computerized transmission of legible prescriptions directly to the 
pharmacy and checks for harmful interactions. 
• Patient satisfaction in a process that results in fewer errors and less waiting time 
• Avoidance of unnecessary phone calls for clarification between Providers and 
Pharmacies. 
• Easier data collection of physician prescribing patterns and improved formulary 
compliance for Health plans, pharmacy benefit managers and employers.

RATIONALE:  
Foot ulceration is the most common single precursor to lower extremity amputations among 
persons with diabetes. Treatment of infected foot wounds accounts for up to one-quarter of all 
inpatient hospital admissions for people with diabetes in the United States. Peripheral sensory 
neuropathy in the absence of perceived trauma is the primary factor leading to diabetic foot 
ulcerations. Approximately 45-60% of all diabetic ulcerations are purely neuropathic. Other forms of 
neuropathy may also play a role in foot ulcerations. Motor neuropathy resulting in anterior crural 
muscle atrophy or intrinsic muscle wasting can lead to foot deformities such as foot drop, equinus, 
and hammertoes. In people with diabetes, 22.8% have foot problems -- such as amputations and 
numbness -- compared with 10% of nondiabetics. Over the age of 40 years old, 30% of people with 
diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet. 
 
CLINCAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
Recognizing important risk factors and making a logical, treatment-oriented assessment of the 
diabetic foot requires a consistent and thorough diagnostic approach using a common language. 
Without such a method, the practitioner is more likely to overlook vital information and to pay 
inordinate attention to less critical points in the evaluation. A useful examination will involve 
identification of key risk factors and assignment into appropriate risk category. Only then can an 
effective treatment plan be designed and implemented. (ACFAS/ACFAOM Clinical Practice 
Guidelines)

RATIONALE:  
Foot ulceration is the most common single precursor to lower extremity amputations among 
persons with diabetes. Shoe trauma, in concert with loss of protective sensation and concomitant 
foot deformity, is the leading event precipitating foot ulceration in persons with diabetes. Treatment 
of infected foot wounds accounts for up to one-quarter of all inpatient hospital admissions for 
people with diabetes in the United States. Peripheral sensory neuropathy in the absence of 
perceived trauma is the primary factor leading to diabetic foot ulcerations. Approximately 45-60% 
of all diabetic ulcerations are purely neuropathic. In people with diabetes, 22.8% have foot 
problems -- such as amputations and numbness -- compared with 10% of nondiabetics. Over the 
age of 40 years old, 30% of people with diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet. 
 
CLINCAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The multifactorial etiology of diabetic foot ulcers is evidenced by the numerous pathophysiologic 
pathways that can potentially lead to this disorder. Among these are two common mechanisms by 
which foot deformity and neuropathy may induce skin breakdown in persons with diabetes. The 
first mechanism of injury refers to prolonged low pressure over a bony prominence (i.e., bunion or 
hammertoe deformity). This generally causes wounds over the medial, lateral, and dorsal aspects 
of the forefoot and is associated with tight or ill-fitting shoes. (ACFAS/ACFAOM Clinical Practice

Measure #128: Universal Weight Screening and Follow-Up 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 65 years and older with a calculated Body Mass Index (BMI) within 
the past six months or during the current visit that is documented in the medical record and if the 
most recent BMI is ≥ 30 or < 22, a follow-up plan is documented 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients seen during the 
reporting period. The most recent quality code submitted will be used for performance calculation. 
There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be reported by clinicians 
who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the 
measure-specific denominator coding. BMI measured and documented in the medical record may 
be reported if done in the provider’s office/facility or if BMI calculation within the past six months is 
documented in outside medical records obtained by the provider. The documentation of a follow up 
plan should be based on the most recently calculated BMI. 
 
This measure is reported using G-codes: 
CPT procedure codes, CPT E/M codes, CPT service codes, HCPCS D-codes, HCPCS G-codes, 
and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients who are included in the 
measure’s denominator. G-codes are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate denominator code(s) and the appropriate 
numerator G-code. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patients with BMI calculated within the past six months or during the current visit and a follow up 
plan documented if the BMI is ≥ 30 or < 22  
 
Definitions: 
BMI – Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person’s weight and height. 
BMI provides a reliable indicator of body fatness for most people and is used to screen for 
weight categories that may lead to health problems. BMI is calculated by dividing a 
person’s weight (in kilograms) by his/her height (in meters, squared). BMI can also be 
calculated by multiplying weight (in pounds) by 705, then dividing by height (in inches) 
twice. A simpler method to calculate the BMI involves the use of a chart. The weight is 
plotted on one axis and the height is plotted on the other axis. The BMI can then be read 
where the two points intersect. Example BMI charts are widely available via the internet.  
Calculated BMI – Requires that both the height and weight are actually measured. Values 
merely reported by the patient cannot be used. 
Follow-up plan – Proposed outline of treatment to be conducted as a result of abnormal 
BMI measurement. Such follow-up can include documentation of a future appointment, 
education, referral, prescription/administration of medications/dietary supplements, etc. 
Not eligible for BMI measurement – Patients can be considered not eligible in the 
following situations: 
 
 
12/31/2007  
308
  
 
• If the patient already is diagnosed as over or under weight and there is documentation 
in the medical record that the weight problem is being managed by another provider 
• If the patient has a terminal illness 
• If the patient refuses BMI measurement 
• If there is any other reason documented in the medical record by the provider 
explaining why BMI measurement was not appropriate 
• Patient is in an urgent or emergent medical situation where time is of the essence and 
to delay treatment would jeopardize the patient’s health status

RATIONALE: 
Of the Medicare population, 37 percent are overweight and 18 percent are obese, the economic 
impact of which has been estimated at $117 billion in the U.S. Additionally, elderly patients with 
unintentional weight loss are at higher risk for infection, depression and death. Older people have 
special nutritional needs due to age and disease processes and professionals of all disciplines 
need to help older individuals modify their nutritional status, thereby improving quality of life 
(American Dietetic Association, Nutrition Screening Initiative, 2002). 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen all adult patients for obesity and offer intensive 
counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss for obese adults. (Level 
of Evidence = B, USPSTF)  
 
The clinical guideline for obesity recommends assessment of BMI at each encounter (National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute). 
 
Validated measure of nutrition status serves as an indicator of over-nourishment and under-
nourishment. Nutrition Screening Initiative: “Nutrition Interventions Manual for Professionals Caring 
for Older Americans,” 2002 (Co-sponsored by American Dietetic Association (ADA), AAFP and 
National Council on Aging, Inc.). 
 
The NSI-suggested BMI range is 22-27 (values outside this range indicate overweight or 
underweight for elderly) Nutrition Screening Initiative: “Nutrition Interventions Manual for

(ADA), AAFP and National Council on Aging, Inc.). 
 
Interventions can be grouped into six primary categories: Social Services, Oral Health, Mental 
Health, Medication Use, Nutritional Education and Counseling, and Nutritional Support. For further 
detail on any of the potential interventional strategies, see the Nutritional Interventions Manual for 
Professionals Caring for Older Americans, 2002. Nutrition Screening Initiative: “Nutrition

RATIONALE: 
In the United States, epidemics of influenza typically occur during the winter months and have 
been associated with an average of approximately 36,000 deaths per year during 1990-1999. The 
CDC reported that although the target coverage set by Healthy People 2010 is 90 percent for 
annual influenza immunization, in 2002 national statistics demonstrated rates of only 66 percent. 
This measure focuses on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
revised recommendation of annual influenza vaccination for all persons age 50 and over, with a 
reminder to providers that they should routinely offer influenza vaccine to patients throughout the 
influenza season. (see MMWR 2006 citation below) 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccination for persons aged 50 or older. 
 
In order not to duplicate resources, the task force did not update their 1996 immunization 
recommendations and cites the CDC recommendations above, noting that ACIP’s methods used to 
review evidence may differ from those used by USPSTF.

Measure #130: Universal Documentation and Verification of Current Medications in the 
Medical Record 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with written provider documentation that current 
medications with dosages (includes prescription, over-the-counter, herbals, vitamin/mineral/dietary 
[nutritional] supplements) were verified with the patient or authorized representative  
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported at each visit occurring during the reporting period for patients seen 
during the reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may 
be reported by non-MD/DO clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure 
based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using G-codes: 
CPT service codes, CPT procedure codes, HCPCS G-codes and patient demographics (age, 
gender, etc.) are used to identify patients who are included in the measure’s denominator. G-codes 
are used to report the numerator of the measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate denominator code(s) and the appropriate 
numerator G-code. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Verification of patient’s current medications with dosages is documented 
 
Definitions: 
Authorized representative – A person who is acting on the patient’s behalf and who does 
not have a conflict of interest with the patient, when the patient is temporarily or 
permanently unable to act for himself or herself. This person should have the patient’s best 
interests at heart and should be reasonably expected to act in a manner that is protective 
of the person and the rights of the patient. Preferably, this individual is appointed by the 
patient. 
Not eligible – A patient is not eligible if one or more of the following condition(s) exist: 
• Patient refuses to participate 
• Patient is in an urgent or emergent medical situation where time is of the essence and 
to delay treatment would jeopardize the patient’s health status 
• Patient cognitively impaired and no authorized representative available 
Current medications – All medications (includes prescription, over-the-counter, herbals, 
vitamin/mineral/dietary [nutritional] supplements) a patient may be taking routinely and/or 
on a PRN basis

RATIONALE: 
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are one of the leading causes of hospitalizations and deaths in the 
U.S., with 13% of ADEs occurring in patients with a prior or documented allergy/reaction to the 
reactive drug. Using a medication list in the office setting promotes patient safety and reduces 
medical errors, both by improving documentation in general and, specifically, by improving 
communication between patients and providers. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
In addition, as part of its efforts to promote patient safety and reduce the growing incidence of 
medical errors in the office setting, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement created a 
recommended medication list for patients and their families to carry with them to medical 
appointments to help providers reconcile medications during medical visits. Refer to: Institute for 
Healthcare Improvement, Medication List For Patients and Families, and Massachusetts Coalition 
for the Prevention of Medical Error (in collaboration with the Massachusetts Medical Society). ]

of drug therapy and estimates of the proportion of outpatients experiencing an ADE per 
year range from 5-35%, with 13% of events occurring in patients with a prior or 
documented allergy/reaction to the causative drug. There is need for improved physician-

Measure #131: Pain Assessment Prior to Initiation of Patient Treatment 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with documentation of a pain assessment (if pain 
is present, including location, intensity and description) through discussion with the patient or 
through use of a standardized tool on each initial evaluation prior to initiation of therapy 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported for each initial evaluation occurring during the reporting period for 
patients seen during the reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This 
measure may be reported by non-MD/DO clinicians who perform the quality actions described in 
the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using G-codes: 
CPT service codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients who 
are included in the measure’s denominator. G-codes are used to report the numerator of the 
measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate denominator code(s) and the appropriate 
numerator G-code. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patient’s pain assessment prior to initiation of treatment is documented 
 
Definitions: 
Standardized tool – A standardized tool is a test or measure administered and scored in 
a consistent manner and supported by psychometric literature. Examples of tools for pain 
assessment include, but are not limited to, Multidimensional Pain Score and McGill Pain 
Questionnaire. 
Not eligible – A patient is not eligible if the following condition(s) exist: 
• Patient refuses to participate 
• Severe mental and/or physical incapacity where the person is unable to express 
himself/herself in a manner understood by others. For example, cases where pain 
cannot be accurately assessed through use of nationally recognized standardized pain 
assessment tools 
• Situations where the patient’s motivation to improve may impact the accuracy of 
results of nationally recognized standardized pain assessment tools 
• Patient is in an urgent or emergent situation where time is of the essence and to delay 
treatment would jeopardize the patient’s health status

RATIONALE: 
The multidisciplinary pain management team is the optimal method for delivery of comprehensive 
treatment to patients in pain. Thus, it is essential for therapists to assess pain prior to initiation of 
therapy. Pain is the most common symptom for which the general population seeks health care, 
with chronic pain costing the U.S. $100 billion per year in lost worker productivity and health costs.   
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) supports that the intensity of pain should be 
assessed prior to the initiation of appropriate treatment and continually reassessed throughout the 
duration of treatment. 
 
Reducing the intensity of the pain by just 25% has been shown to achieve a 50% improvement in 
functional status (Flor, Fydrich, & Turk, 1992. Evidence Grade = A). 
 
Older adults with persistent pain commonly experience an increase in pain intensity with movement 
and, as a result, will limit the activities or movements that exacerbate the pain (e.g., stair climbing 
or walking) (Davis, Hiemenz, & White, 2002; Duong et al., 2005. Evidence Grade = C). 
 
A multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of pain is the preferred method of 
delivering health care to patients with chronic pain of any etiology due to the complexity of 
diagnosis and management. (International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Task Force on 
Guidelines for Desirable Characteristics for Pain Treatment Facilities, Level N/A).

development of the treatment plan/plan of care. Appropriate documentation includes signature of 
the practitioner and either co-signature of the patient or documented verbal agreement obtained 
from the patient or, when necessary, an authorized representative 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported at least one time for each unique episode of care for patients seen 
during the reporting period. For the purpose of this measure, a unique episode of care is defined by 
the care given for each unique diagnosis (ICD-9 code) during the reporting period. This measure 
may be reported by non-MD/DO clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the 
measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using G-codes: 
CPT service codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients who 
are included in the measure’s denominator. G-codes are used to report the numerator of the 
measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate denominator code(s) and the appropriate 
numerator G-code. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patient’s active participation in development of treatment plan/plan of care is documented 
 
Definitions: 
Unique episode of care – For the purpose of this measure is defined by each unique 
ICD-9 code billed in combination with an appropriate CPT service code during the 
reporting period. Multiple diagnoses on a claim form will count as one episode. 
Active participation – Patient involvement in discussions, decisions, objectives 
determination, and goal setting to the extent that the patient is a co-author of, and 
responds affirmatively to, the care plan/treatment plan. 
Care plan/treatment plan – A roadmap or course of action involving input and approval 
from the patient.   
Authorized representative – A person who is acting on the patient’s behalf and who does 
not have a conflict of interest with the patient, when the patient is temporarily or 
permanently unable to act for himself or herself, but not against the patient’s wishes. This 
person should have the patient’s best interests at heart and should be reasonably 
expected to act in a manner that is protective of the person and the rights of the patient. 
Preferably, this individual is appointed by the patient. 
Not eligible – A patient is not eligible if one or more of the following conditions exist:

RATIONALE: 
Collaborative interventions involving both client and care provider are significantly more acceptable 
and likely to produce follow through than directive approaches. This is consistent with the findings 
of Ed Wagner’s “The Chronic Care Model,” which states that evidence-based change concepts 
foster productive interactions between informed patients who take an active part in their care and 
providers with resources and expertise.  
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The Siskin Hospital for Physical Rehabilitation states that patients’ basic treatment plan and initial 
goals should include input and agreement of the patient before treatment begins, while the Scottish 
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) suggests that patients and their caregivers should have 
an early, active role in the multidisciplinary rehabilitation team. 
 
The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) recommends that patients and their families 
should be educated and actively engaged as to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options, while 
the National Collaborating Center for Mental Health recommends that health care professionals 
 
 
12/31/2007  
322
  
 
should make all efforts necessary to ensure that a patient can give meaningful and properly 
informed consent before treatment is initiated. 
 
The 2005 Standards of Practice for Occupational Therapy recommends in Standard III, 1: An 
occupational therapist has overall responsibility for the development, documentation, and 
implementation of the occupational therapy intervention based on the evaluation, client goals, 
current best evidence, and clinical reasoning (American Occupational Therapy Association). 
A 2001 American Psychiatric Association guideline states that treatment of patients with borderline 
personality disorders should be a collaborative process between patient and clinician and that 
patient preference is an important factor to consider in developing an individual treatment plan 
(APA). 
 
The 2004 Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VHA) guideline 
states that treatment options for persons with psychoses should be presented and discussed with 
the person/legal guardian and then proceed with treatment if the person/legal guardian consents 
(DoD and VHA). 
 
Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement 1995 guideline suggests that providers should 
recognize that it is a sign of progress when a patient becomes more ready to change a health-
related behavior (ICSI). 
 
In a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2005 guideline for substance 
abuse treatment for persons with co-occurring disorders, motivational interviewing was cited as 
being proven effective in helping clients clarify goals and commit to change (SAMHSA).

Additionally 76% of participants with post-college education, 73% of participants with some 
college education, and 49% of participants with a high school education preferred patient-
centered communication.

illness?" Effective Clinical Practice 1: 2-4. 
The chronic care model identifies the essential elements of a health care system that 
encourage high-quality chronic disease care. These elements are the community, the 
health system, self-management support, delivery system design, decision support and 
clinical information systems. Evidence-based change concepts under each element, in 
combination, foster productive interactions between informed patients who take an active 
part in their care and providers with resources and expertise. The model can be applied to 
a variety of chronic illnesses, health care settings and target populations. The bottom line 
is healthier patients, more satisfied providers, and cost savings.

Measure #133: Screening for Cognitive Impairment 
 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 65 years and older who have documentation of results of a screening 
for cognitive impairment using a standardized tool  
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients seen during the 
reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be 
reported by non-MD/DO clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based 
on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using G-codes: 
CPT service codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients who 
are included in the measure’s denominator. G-codes are used to report the numerator of the 
measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate denominator code(s) and the appropriate 
numerator G-code. 
 
NUMERATOR: 
Patient’s screening for cognitive impairment is documented 
 
Definitions: 
Screening – Testing done on people at risk of developing a certain disease, even if they 
have no symptoms. Screening tests can predict the likelihood of someone having or 
developing a particular disease. This measure looks for the test being done in the 
practitioner’s office that is filing the code. 
Standardized tool – An assessment tool that has been appropriately normalized and 
validated for the population in which it is used. Some examples of cognitive impairment 
screening tools include: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination 
(MMSE), Global Deterioration Scale, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Clock 
Drawing Test, Modified MMSE, Mini-Cog, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, and 7-Minute 
Screen. 
Cognitive impairment – Impairment of mental activities associated with thinking, learning, 
and memory. 
Not eligible/not appropriate – A patient is not eligible/not appropriate if one or more of 
the following conditions exist: 
• Patient refuses to participate 
• Patient is in an urgent or emergent situation where time is of the essence and to delay 
treatment would jeopardize the patient’s health status 
• Patient was referred with a diagnosis of cognitive impairment 
• Patient has been participating in on-going treatment with screening of cognitive 
impairment in a preceding reporting period 
• Patient is not appropriate for cognitive impairment screening due to physical capacity

RATIONALE: 
As many as 6.8 million people in the U.S. have dementia, and at least 1.8 million of those are 
severely affected. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reported that Alzheimer’s 
Disease and cerebrovascular ischemia (vascular dementia) are the two most common causes of 
dementia, with estimated economic costs of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in the U.S. totaling at least 
$100 billion annually. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke contends that 
accurate diagnosis of dementia is important for patients and their families because it allows early 
treatment of symptoms.   
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) states that the core of the treatment of demented 
patients is psychiatric management, through psychiatric, neurological, and general medical 
evaluations of the nature and cause of cognitive deficits, while the American Academy of 
Neurology (AAN) states there is good evidence to support the use of general cognitive screening 
instruments. 
 
Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality Measure: 
Overall Evidence Grading: SORT Strength of Recommendation B: considerable patient-oriented 
evidence, i.e., re: improved early detection and initiation of treatment for dementia that may delay 
further progression; reduced iatrogenic illness, unnecessary workups driven by vague symptoms, 
and inappropriate and costly utilization of hospital and emergency room care; and improved 
outcomes, but not consistently high quality evidence 
 
American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 
A guideline revised in 2004 includes the identification and monitoring of Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) patients for progression to Alzheimer’s disease. It also states there is 
good evidence to support the use of general cognitive screening instruments. 
 
 
 
12/31/2007  
326
  
 
In a second guideline developed in 2001, it states that general cognitive screening 
instruments, which include the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), Kokmen Short Test of 
Mental Status, the 7-Minute Screen, or the Memory Impairment Screen, are useful for the 
detection of dementia when used in patient populations with an elevated prevalence of 
cognitive impairment either due to age or presence of memory dysfunction. 
 
A third guideline developed in 2001 on the early detection of dementia included a review of 
the evidence on mild cognitive impairment. It reported that studies indicated that 
individuals characterized as being cognitively impaired, but not meeting clinical criteria for 
Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment), have a high risk of progressing to 
dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. It further reported that, if the figures for incident 
Alzheimer’s disease from the general population are used, one could see that the rates 
range from 0.2% in the 65-69 year age group to 3.9% in the 85-89 year age group. Finally, 
it reported that studies of mild cognitive impairment indicate that the rate of progression to 
dementia or Alzheimer’s disease is between 6% and 25% per year.

Chow, T. W. (2001). "Quality indicators for dementia in vulnerable community dwelling and 
hospitalized elders." Annals of Internal Medicine 135: 668-676. 
A review of 30 quality indicators for dementia resulted in 14 being judged to be valid by the 
expert panel process. These included five dealing with dementia screening and diagnosis. 
The cognitive and functional screening indicator states that, if a vulnerable elder is 
admitted to the hospital or is new to a physician practice, the multidimensional assessment 
of cognitive ability and assessment of functional status should be documented because 
screening for dementia can lead to early detection and initiation of treatment that may 
delay further progression.

treatment for people with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Bloomington, National Chronic Care 
Networks for Alzheimer's Disease initiative. 
Dementia is very prevalent among the elderly, but is often overlooked even by skilled 
clinicians. Unrecognized dementia may lead to iatrogenic illness, unnecessary workups 
driven by vague symptoms, inappropriate and costly utilization of hospital and emergency 
room care, and poor outcomes. Improving our ability to recognize dementia is a key first 
step toward improving this widespread situation. The Chronic Care Networks for 
Alzheimer’s disease early identification process uses two tools to identify people who may 
have dementia and should receive a full assessment. These tools include education and 
awareness materials/triggers and a family questionnaire.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the U.S. and much of 
the world with rates increasing exponentially from age 65. Increases in life expectancy in 
the last century have resulted in a large number of people living to old age and will result in 
a quadrupling of AD cases by the middle of the century. Preventing or delaying the onset 
of AD could have a huge impact in the number of cases expected to develop. The oldest-
old are the fastest growing segment of the population and are estimated to account for 
12% of the population over 65.

Measure #134: Screening for Clinical Depression 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older screened for clinical depression using a 
standardized tool  
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients seen during the 
reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be 
reported by non-MD/DO clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based 
on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. 
 
This measure is reported using G-codes: 
CPT service codes and patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) are used to identify patients who 
are included in the measure’s denominator. G-codes are used to report the numerator of the 
measure.  
 
When reporting the measure, submit the appropriate denominator code(s) and the appropriate 
numerator G-code. 
 
NUMERATOR:

Definitions: 
Screening – Testing done on people at risk of developing a certain disease, even if they 
have no symptoms. Screening tests can predict the likelihood of someone having or 
developing a particular disease. This measure looks for the test being done in the 
practitioner’s office that is filing the code. 
Standardized tool – An assessment tool that has been appropriately normalized and 
validated for the population in which it is used. Some examples of depression screening 
tools include: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI or 
BDI-II), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Depression Scale 
(DEPS), Duke Anxiety-Depression Scale (DADS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), GDS 
- Short Version, Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL), The Zung Self-Rating Depression 
Scale (SDS), and Cornell Scale Screening (this is a screening tool which is used in 
situations where the patient has cognitive impairment and is administered through the 
caregiver).  
Not eligible/not appropriate – A patient is not eligible if one or more of the following 
conditions exist: 
• Patient refuses to participate 
• Patient is in an urgent or emergent situation where time is of the essence and to delay 
treatment would jeopardize the patient’s health status 
• Situations where the patient’s motivation to improve may impact the accuracy of 
results of nationally recognized standardized depression assessment tools. For 
example: certain court appointed cases

• Patient was referred with a diagnosis of depression 
• Patient has been participating in on-going treatment with screening of clinical 
depression in a preceding reporting period 
• Severe mental and/or physical incapacity where the person is unable to express 
himself/herself in a manner understood by others. For example: cases such as 
delirium or severe cognitive impairment, where depression cannot be accurately 
assessed through use of nationally recognized standardized depression assessment 
tools

RATIONALE: 
Major depression was the fourth leading cause of worldwide disease in 1990, with estimated direct 
and indirect costs to American businesses ranging from $36.2 to $80 billion annually. The U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force compared the effects of integrated recognition and management 
depression screening programs with “usual care” in community primary care practices, and the 
results showed significantly improved patient outcomes. 
 
CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: 
USPSTF recommends screening adults for depression in clinical practices that have systems in 
place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up. Small benefits have been 
observed in studies that simply feed back screening results to clinicians. Larger benefits have been 
observed in studies in which the communication of screening results is coordinated with effective 
follow-up and treatment. (Evidence: B) 
 
The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care used the rigorous USPSTF 2002 systematic 
review to update their recommendations regarding depression screening. The Canadian task force 
arrived at the same practice recommendations as USPSTF.

This review provides an overview of evidence identifying use of health services for 
depression, effective interventions, barriers to depression care, strategies to reduce 
barriers, and translating research into practice. There is strong empirical support for 
implementing strategies to improve depression care for older adults, and there is recent 
encouraging evidence from Medicare data that older adults may be more willing to seek 
and accept antidepressant treatment.

settings." The Medical Journal of Australia 177: S111-116. 
This meta-analysis included reviews found by searching MEDLINE, Cochrane, and other 
databases. It found that screening increases the recognition and diagnosis of depression 
and, when integrated with a commitment to provide coordinated and prompt follow-up of 
diagnosis and treatment, clinical outcomes are improved.

This study aims to clarify whether screening adults for depression in primary care settings 
improves recognition, treatment, and clinical outcomes. It concludes that, compared with 
usual care, screening for depression can improve outcomes, particularly when screening is 
coupled with system changes that help ensure adequate treatment and follow-up.
