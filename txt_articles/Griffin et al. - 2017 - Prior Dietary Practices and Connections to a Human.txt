SUMMARY
Ensuring that gut microbiota respond consistently to
prescribed dietary interventions, irrespective of prior
dietary practices (DPs), is critical for effective nutri-
tional therapy. To address this, we identified DP-
associated gut bacterial taxa in individuals either
practicing chronic calorie restriction with adequate
nutrition (CRON) or without dietary restrictions
(AMER). When transplanted into gnotobiotic mice,
AMER and CRON microbiota responded predictably
to CRON and AMER diets but with variable response
strengths. An individual’s microbiota is connected to
other individuals’ communities (‘‘metacommunity’’)
by
microbial
exchange.
Sequentially
cohousing
AMER-colonized mice with two different groups of
CRON-colonized mice simulated metacommunity ef-
fects, resulting in enhanced responses to a CRON
diet intervention and changes in several metabolic
features in AMER animals. This response was driven
by an influx of CRON DP-associated taxa. Certain
DPs may impair responses to dietary interventions,
necessitating the introduction of diet-responsive
bacterial lineages present in other individuals and
identified using the strategies described.
INTRODUCTION
The microbiota of an individual is not an isolated community, but
rather exists within a large metacommunity, in which microbes
have the potential to disperse between people to colonize new
gut habitats and to become locally extinct from others. The diver-
sity and richness of organisms within individuals, as well as the
similarity in composition between individuals, is governed by
several ecological factors, including (i) selective pressures within
host habitats, such as diet and antibiotic exposures (Falony
et al., 2016; Zhernakova et al., 2016; Bokulich et al., 2016), and
(ii) rates of colonization and extinction of specific microbial line-
ages within and between hosts. Global surveys of human gut
microbiota have shown that Westernization is associated with
lower taxonomic and functional diversity, which may be partially
restored by dietary interventions involving calorie restriction (Le
Chatelier et al., 2013; Cotillard et al., 2013). The microbiota of
cohabitating individuals develop increased community similarity,
indicating that transfer of gut taxa occurs between people with
close associations (Song et al., 2013). The relative strengths of
selection and dispersal in influencing community structure and
diversity can vary across different metacommunities. Compari-
sons to null models suggest that in the USA, lower dispersal
and highly variable selection play major roles in leading to
reduced alpha-diversity and greater beta-diversity, whereas in
Sausi and Asaro populations in Papua New Guinea, greater
dispersal and more consistent selection lead to greater alpha-
diversity and lower beta-diversity (Martı
´nez et al., 2015).
Interpersonal differences in the richness and composition of
gut bacterial taxa have been correlated with biomarkers of meta-
bolic and physiological health, as well as variation in metabolic
and immunological responses to particular foods (e.g., Le Cha-
telier et al., 2013; Cotillard et al., 2013; Martı
´nez et al., 2013;
Zhu et al., 2016; Zeevi et al., 2015; Stefka et al., 2014). Short-
term consumption of animal- or plant-based diets has been re-
ported to reproducibly alter microbial community structure and
gene expression in small groups of humans (David et al.,
2014). Nonetheless, it is unclear whether individuals practicing
different long-term dietary practices (DPs) have the capacity to
respond to a given dietary intervention in a similar manner, or
whether variation in their community structures leads to marked
interpersonal differences in their responses. Thus, understand-
ing how selection and dispersal impact responses to dietary
84

 interventions and how diet impacts these processes is important
for a number of reasons, including (i) identifying microbes
associated with different DPs, (ii) predicting the responses of in-
dividuals to prescribed diets based on a consideration of the rep-
resentation of these microbes in the targeted human population,
and (iii) determining the extent to which DP-associated microbes
can be used therapeutically as probiotics to enhance both the
magnitude and durability of responses to prescribed dietary in-
terventions in individuals lacking these taxa.
The current study focuses on two groups of people living in
the USA who exemplify distinct DPs: those who practice chronic
calorie restriction with optimized intake of nutrients (CRON), and
those without prescribed or self-imposed dietary restrictions
(AMER). Analysis of the nutrient intake of members of the Calo-
rie Restriction Society has shown that these adherents to a
CRON DP exceed the recommended daily intake of all essential
nutrients while consuming nearly 50% fewer calories than their
AMER counterparts (Fontana et al., 2004). They avoid pro-
cessed and refined foods rich in (trans) saturated fatty acids
and high-glycemic carbohydrates. This DP is associated with
reductions in risk factors for atherosclerosis and cancer, as
well as improvements in several physiological and metabolic
parameters (Fontana and Partridge, 2015). Moreover, long-
term calorie restriction has been shown to influence gut micro-
bial community structure in C57BL/6J mice (Zhang et al., 2013).
We identify distinguishing characteristics of the fecal microbiota
of CRON and AMER individuals, use food journals of CRON
and AMER practitioners to design diets representative of their
DPs, and examine the effects of imposing these two disparate
DPs on gnotobiotic mice colonized with transplanted fecal
microbiota
from
AMER
and
CRON
donors.
Finally,
we
examine whether AMER-colonized mice alter their responses
to a CRON diet intervention when cohoused sequentially with
mice harboring the transplanted microbiota of two different
CRON donors. These experiments address several questions.
Do transplanted microbiota from different individuals with
different DPs take on similar configurations in response to pre-
scribed diets? Do bacteria identified as DP-associated in the
human population drive diet-induced reconfigurations in trans-
planted communities? Does exposure to DP-associated bacte-
ria from other donors (simulating the potential for dispersal
within a metacommunity) alter an individual donor’s community
and metabolic responses to a diet intervention?
RESULTS
Discriminatory Features of the Fecal Microbiota of
CRON and AMER Subjects
Single fecal samples were obtained from 34 adult CRON do-
nors with body mass indices (BMIs) from 16.7 to 22.5 kg/m2,
and 198 AMER donors. AMER microbiota donors (n = 198)
were placed into five different BMI ‘‘bins’’ (n = 66, lean [BMI
% 25 kg/m2]; n = 29, overweight [BMI 25–30 kg/m2]; n = 27,
obese I [BMI 30–35 kg/m2]; n = 26, obese II [BMI 35–
40 kg/m2]; n = 50 obese III [BMI > 40 kg/m2]). In the AMER
cohort, 170 individuals were related to at least one other
AMER donor in either twin sibling or mother-daughter relation-
ships. CRON donors had practiced this DP for 2–21 years and
none belonged to the same family. Donors had not used antibi-
otics for at least 4 months prior to sampling. The gut microbiota
of CRON and AMER subjects were characterized by multiplex
sequencing of PCR amplicons generated from variable region
4 (V4) of bacterial 16S rRNA genes present in pulverized fecal
samples (Table S1A).
Linear mixed-effects models (LMEs), followed by comparisons
of least-squares means (LS-means), revealed that CRON fecal
microbiota were significantly richer and more diverse than their
AMER counterparts (Figure 1A; Table S2A–S2C). On average,
CRON microbiota had greater phylogenetic diversity (PD;
p = 3.0 3 10�8), which measures the phylogenetic branch length
represented in a community, more OTUs detected (p = 0.0001),
and greater Shannon’s diversity indices (p = 2.7 3 10�5) and
Pielou’s evenness indices (p = 4.0 3 10�5). The increased taxo-
nomic diversity and richness observed in CRON subjects
compared to AMER subjects is consistent with the results of
a previous study reporting that gut microbiomes with low
gene content are associated with lower consumption of fruits
and vegetables (Cotillard et al., 2013). Both phylogenetic diver-
sity (PD, p = 0.024) and observed OTUs (p = 0.025) were greater
in lean versus obese AMER individuals who were members of
the twin cohort. Moreover, paired t tests in twin pairs discordant
for obesity also showed significantly greater values in lean co-
twins for PD (p = 0.011) and observed OTUs (p = 0.035). These
results are consistent with our previous studies (Turnbaugh
et al., 2009).
We used UniFrac distances, a phylogenetic measure of the
dissimilarity between microbial communities, to examine pat-
terns of beta-diversity. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of
unweighted UniFrac distances showed that lean AMER and
CRON individuals clustered apart from each other (Figure 1B).
Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)
revealed that DPs explained 7.9% (p = 0.0001) of the variance
in their unweighted UniFrac distances and 11.6% (p = 0.0001)
of the variance in their weighted UniFrac distances (Figure S1A;
Table S2D–S2I). To avoid bias due to sampling related to AMER
individuals, the 39 lean AMER subjects with the most 16S rRNA
reads among their respective families were utilized for UniFrac-
based analyses, as well as the following Random Forests and in-
dicator species analyses.
Random Forests classification was used to determine how
well the compositions and relative abundances of 97% ID
OTUs in the human donors’ fecal microbiota discriminated be-
tween the AMER and CRON DPs. In 100 independent runs
with 1,000 decision trees each, the out-of-box error rate was
low (4.4% ± 0.1%; mean ± SEM); the mean percentage of runs
in which an individual’s microbiota was successfully classified
was 97.2% ± 2.1% for AMER subjects and 93.6% ± 3.7% for
CRON individuals (mean ± SEM). Hierarchical clustering of the
algorithm’s mean proximity scores placed the sample commu-
nities into two large clusters, each dominated by either CRON
or AMER subjects (Figure S1B). The 100 Random Forests-gener-
ated models also successfully predicted the DPs of the remain-
ing AMER subjects based on their fecal microbiota. Of these
subjects, 93.6% were successfully identified as AMER in every
run; this high degree of success was observed across all BMI
categories (lean, 99.8% ± 0.2%; overweight, 92.2% ± 5.0%;
Obese I, 98.4% ± 1.4%; Obese II, 100.0% ± 0.0%; Obese III,
97.8% ± 2.0% [mean ± SEM]).

 To identify bacterial OTUs associated with the CRON and
AMER DPs, we combined indicator species analysis and phi-
coefficient analysis. Indicator species analysis measures the
strength of association between an organism and a habitat
type as the product of its fidelity (probability of occurrence in a
habitat type), and its specificity mean abundance in that habitat
type, normalized to the sum of its mean abundances in all other
habitat types observed) (Dufre
ˆ ne and Legendre, 1997). A taxon is
indicative of a particular habitat type if it is much more likely to
occur in that type than in another, or if it is much more abundant
in that type. Phi-coefficient analysis measures the correlation be-
tween a habitat type and the presence or absence of an organ-
ism. The significance of these associations was determined by
permutation tests, followed by Benjamini-Hochberg corrections
for multiple tests. OTUs were considered significantly associ-
ated with a DP if they had a significant indicator species value
or phi-coefficient, or if both indicated significant associations
with the same DP. We compared the results of these analyses
to the OTUs’ feature importance scores (mean decreases in ac-
curacy across all Random Forests runs).

Indicator species analysis and phi-co-
efficient analysis identified 242 DP-asso-
ciated OTUs, of which 159 (65.7%) were
significantly associated with the same
DP by both metrics (Figure 1C; Table
S3A). Of the significant DP-associated
OTUs, 173 (71.5%) were CRON-associ-
ated, compared to 69 (28.5%) that were
significantly associated with the lean
AMER subjects. Of the CRON-associated
OTUs, 69 (39.9%) were detected in less
than 10% of lean AMER subjects, while
only 15 (21.7%) of the lean AMER-associ-
ated OTUs were present in less than 10%
of the CRON individuals. Random Forests
feature selection scores were positively correlated with the asso-
ciation strengths defined by the indicator species analysis
(Spearman’s r = 0.63, p < 10�15; Figure S1C). These findings,
together with the increased richness and diversity observed in
CRON subjects, suggest that the CRON lifestyle is associated
with a large number of OTUs that are not commonly detected
in people practicing the AMER DP.
We developed a metric, community indicator value (CIV), to
describe how strongly skewed a microbial community is toward
CRON-associated or AMER-associated bacteria. CIV calculates
the mean difference between each OTU’s AMER and CRON in-
dicator species values, for all OTUs present in an individual’s gut
community. The weighted version (wCIV) is the relative abun-
dance-weighted sum of these differences in indicator species
values (Figure 1D). Both metrics range from �1, where all
OTUs are completely associated with the CRON DP, to +1,
where all are perfectly associated with the AMER DP. Mean
values of both CIV and wCIV were significantly lower in CRON in-
dividuals than in AMER individuals, indicating that the microbiota
of CRON individuals were skewed toward greater representation
86
Cell Host & Microbe 21, 84–96, January 11, 2017
 of bacteria associated with the CRON DP (Figures 1E and S1D;
Table S3B–S3D). These two metrics provide information about
different ecological processes. CIV is expected to increase
with new colonization by taxa that are more strongly AMER-
associated. wCIV is affected by new colonization as well, but is
also sensitive to increases in the relative abundance of more
AMER-associated taxa that are already present. CIV and wCIV
were convenient measures for tracking the responses of
CRON and AMER donor microbiota transplanted into gnotobi-
otic mice in two different experimental contexts: (i) as ‘‘isolated’’
communities exposed to representative CRON and AMER diets
monotonously or in diet oscillations, and (ii) as ‘‘metacommun-
ities’’ formed through deliberate sequential cohousings of
AMER- and CRON-colonized mice subjected to a CRON diet
intervention.
Variability in Responses of Different Human Microbiota
to CRON and AMER DPs in Gnotobiotic Mice
To determine whether the gut microbial communities of multiple
individuals practicing the AMER or CRON DP mount generaliz-
able responses to a switch in DP, we designed representative
AMER and CRON diets and administered them to gnotobiotic
mice colonized with fecal microbiota from CRON and AMER
individuals. AMER and CRON DPs encompass an enormous
set of possible food items and combinations. To identify differ-
ences in the diets of AMER and CRON subjects, and then
generate diets that embody these differences, we compared
food diaries from individuals representing the two DPs (Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). On average, on a daily basis,
CRON individuals consumed 42.1% fewer kilocalories, 48.6%
less total fat, 33.5% less carbohydrates, 37.6% less total pro-
tein, and 60.8% less protein from animal sources than their
AMER counterparts (ANOVA, p < 0.05; Table S4A). We used
these food journals to generate randomly selected lists of 41
food entries (the median number consumed daily). We then
selected one menu for each DP that was most closely represen-
tative of the mean consumption of kilocalories, carbohydrates,
proteins, and fats. This approach allowed us to generate repre-
sentative diets using actual foods consumed by the two human
groups without our own biases. The ingredients for each diet
were cooked where appropriate, homogenized, and sterilized
by gamma-irradiation (Supplemental Experimental Procedures;
Table S4B–S4D).
Ten trios of adult (11–12 week old) male germfree C57BL6/J
mice were individually caged and distributed among 10 gnotobi-
otic isolators. Mice were colonized, by oral gavage, with the fecal
microbiota of one of five AMER donors or one of five CRON do-
nors (Figure 2A). Each donor’s microbiota was transplanted into
mice in a single isolator. Within each isolator, one mouse was fed
the AMER diet ad libitum, and another was fed the CRON diet
restricted to �60% of ad libitum caloric intake of the AMER
diet. Additionally, the third mouse received the diet reflecting mi-
crobiota donor’s original DP, but at an altered caloric intake. For
AMER donors, the third mouse was fed the AMER diet at a
caloric intake equal to that of the CRON restricted treatment.
For CRON donors, the third mouse was fed the CRON diet ad li-
bitum (Figure 2A). Mice were maintained on their diet regimens
from 2 weeks prior to colonization until they were sacrificed
11 weeks later. Body weights were recorded weekly throughout
the experiment, and fecal samples were taken at the time points
shown in Figure 2A.
Body weight was significantly influenced by diet treatment
(p = 3.9 3 10�8; LME) and not by the DPs of microbiota donors
(p = 0.840; LME); by the end of the experiment, mice on the
AMER diet had gained 23.0% ± 3.7% (mean ± SEM) of their initial
body weight when fed ad libitum and lost 14.6% ± 1.3% at the
restricted caloric level. Likewise, mice fed the CRON diet ad libi-
tum lost 1.0% ± 2.1% while those fed the CRON diet at the
restricted level lost 18.4% ± 1.8% (Table S5A). The relative
weights of the epididymal fat pads mirrored this pattern and
were highly correlated with change in body weight (Pearson’s
correlation = 0.912, p = 3.4 3 10�11; Table S5A).
Fecal microbial communities collected over the course of the
experiment, and cecal contents harvested at sacrifice, were
characterized by bacterial V4-16S rRNA gene sequencing
(Table S1B and Figure 2A). PCoA of unweighted UniFrac dis-
tances
revealed
that
the
transplanted
fecal
communities
achieved relatively stable compositions by the eighth day after
gavage (Figures 2B and 2C). Therefore, we limited our subse-
quent analyses to fecal samples taken after the 8-day time point.
Beyond this time point, the microbiota of recipient mice
captured, on average, 23.9% ± 0.3% (mean ± SEM; range
14.4%–35.6%) of their human donors’ OTUs, and 87.5% ±
0.4% (mean ± SEM; range 73.7%–96.7%) of the V4-16S rRNA
reads in the donors’ microbiota, suggesting that the most prev-
alent organisms successfully colonized mice (Table S5B).
PERMANOVA revealed that the experimental factors micro-
biota donor, donor DP, and mouse diet type influenced un-
weighted UniFrac and abundance-weighted UniFrac distances
differently (Figures 2D and 2E; Table S5C). For unweighted
UniFrac, microbiota donor DP explained 10.5% of the variance,
donor explained 51.9%, and the mice’s diets explained 6.5%.
For weighted UniFrac, the corresponding values were 5.8%,
39.8%, and 27.7%, respectively. Caloric intake did not signifi-
cantly influence unweighted or weighted UniFrac distances
for mice consuming the CRON or AMER diets (Table S5D
and S5E). PCoA of unweighted UniFrac distances also showed
that the phylogenetic compositions of the gnotobiotic animals’
fecal microbiota remained highly differentiated from each
other according to their human donors and their donors’ DPs
(Figure 2D). However, PCoA of weighted UniFrac distances
divided the mice’s fecal microbiota according to their diet types
(AMER versus CRON), indicating that the various recipient
communities shared similarities in the bacterial lineages that
exhibited altered relative abundances in response to the diets
(Figure 2E).
CIV and wCIV showed the same pattern and confirmed that
bacteria identified as DP-associated in the human population
contributed to the similarity of these community-level responses.
Using mean values obtained from all fecal samples collected
from each mouse after the 8-day time point, LME models
showed that the animals’ diets (F = 48.04, p = 0.0004) and their
microbiota donor’s DPs (F = 6.33, p = 0.0456) significantly influ-
enced CIVs (Figure 2F; Table S5F and S5G). In contrast, only the
diets significantly influenced wCIV (F = 37.61, p = 0.0009); for
both unweighted CIV and weighted CIV, mice consuming the
AMER diet ad libitum consistently had higher values than their
counterparts fed the CRON diet at the restricted level (Figure 2G;
Cell Host & Microbe 21, 84–96, January 11, 2017
87
 Table S5F and S5G). The diet-based responses of individual
donors’ microbiota varied in magnitude but shared predictable
features. On a CRON diet, transplanted AMER microbiota man-
ifested an enhanced representation of members that were clas-
sified as more strongly CRON-associated (Figures 2F and 2G;
Table S5H–S5K). Similarly, transplanted CRON microbiota re-
sponded to the AMER diet exposure by increasing the represen-
tation of more strongly AMER-associated taxa. Paired t tests
revealed no significant differences between groups of mice
consuming different amounts of the same diet. Procrustes ana-
lyses showed that cecal and fecal microbiota at the end of the
experiment showed very similar patterns of beta-diversity, with
high correlations for both unweighted UniFrac (M12 = 0.965,
p = 0.001) and weighted UniFrac (M12 = 0.869, p = 0.001).

Figure 2. Effects of Diet on the Fecal Microbiota of Gnotobiotic Mice Colonized with CRON and AMER Donor Communities
(A) Experimental design used for monotonously fed AMER- and CRON-colonized mice. Time points (days) for microbiota sampling are shown.
(B and C) The first principal coordinates from PCoA plots of unweighted UniFrac (B) and weighted UniFrac (C) distances show initial community assembly in fecal
microbiota of recipient mice.
(D and E) PCoA plots of unweighted UniFrac (D) and weighted UniFrac (E) distances show the effects of experimental treatments on the phylogenetic structures of
the various transplanted donor microbiota. Mean positions in PCoA space are shown for fecal samples collected from each mouse 15–56 days following gavage
of the human donor’s microbiota. Points connected by yellow lines in both panels are from mice colonized by the same AMER donor, and points connected by
blue lines are from the same CRON donor. Circle colors in (D) reflect donor DP, and mouse diet treatment in (E).

 For each donor’s microbiota, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests
with strata defined by the sampling days were used to identify
OTUs whose relative abundances differed consistently over
time between an animal fed the AMER diet ad libitum and an an-
imal consuming the CRON diet at the restricted level. These tests
yielded 180 OTUs with significant differences in at least one
donor microbiota; 73 were previously identified as significantly
DP-associated in the human subjects (46 CRON-associated,
27 AMER-associated; Table S5L). 15 of these 73 DP-associated
OTUs represented at least 1% of a recipient mouse’s fecal mi-
crobiota and exhibited a diet-based difference in relative abun-
dance in at least four donors’ transplanted microbiota. These
15 OTUs accounted for 74 significant diet-based differences
observed across the various transplanted donor microbiota,
91.9% of which were in the direction predicted from their DP-
association in AMER or CRON population (e.g., the CRON-
associated Bacteroides cellulosilyticus OTU 4020502 and the
AMER-associated Ruminococcus sp. Ce2 OTU 289734 at the
top and bottom of Figures 3A and 3B). These microbial re-
sponses also provided direct evidence that common features
of the highly varied diets consumed by a group of unrelated hu-
man subjects within a broadly defined DP were captured by our
randomized approach to diet design.
Exposure to Multiple CRON Microbiota Enhances the
Response of an AMER Microbiota to a CRON Diet
Intervention
We hypothesized that an AMER donor’s transplanted microbiota
would exhibit a greater response to a CRON diet intervention as
part of a metacommunity that included CRON microbiota than it
would if it remained isolated. Cohousing coprophagic mice has
been used in previous studies to determine which bacterial
taxa from one community can invade another under various die-
tary conditions (e.g., Ridaura et al., 2013; Seedorf et al., 2014).
We reasoned that cohousing mice harboring different human
donor microbiota would allow their ‘‘isolated’’ communities to
be placed in a deliberately designed metacommunity. Our
experimental design included four groups of mice: two groups
colonized with the fecal microbiota of a single AMER donor
(AMER5) and two other groups each colonized with microbiota

(A) A heatmap shows differences in mean relative abundances of OTUs, for each transplanted human donor community, between recipient mice fed the AMER
diet (ad libitum) and those fed the CRON diet (restricted). Cells outlined in black represent significant differences (p < 0.05; NS, non-significant differences).
AMER-associated and CRON-associated OTUs are highlighted in red and blue text, respectively.
(B) A volcano plot shows the significance and magnitude of differences in the relative abundances of OTUs between the diet treatments, as defined Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel tests followed by FDR correction of p values. PFDR-values of zero are plotted as %4.9 3 10�323 (minimum non-zero value calculated by the R

 from one of two different CRON donors (Figures 4A and 4B). The
human donor AMER5 was chosen because that subject’s trans-
planted fecal microbiota had very high CIV values in the gnotobi-
otic mouse experiment described in Figure 2A (i.e., was the most
skewed toward AMER-associated OTUs even in the context of
the CRON diet; Figure 2F). The CRON1 and CRON5 donors
were chosen due to the very strong responses of their trans-
planted microbiota to CRON versus AMER diets (Figures 2D–
2G). Five AMER-colonized mice that would not be exposed to
other communities were maintained as controls (AMER-Control).
The other five AMER-colonized mice served as the target hosts
(AMER-Target) that would be exposed to CRON1 and CRON5
mice. All mice were initially caged individually, with each group
of animals maintained in a separate gnotobiotic isolator. All
mice were started on the diets of their microbiota donor 3 days
prior to transplantation (Figure 4A). To provide a within-experi-
ment measurement of the response of the transplanted donor
communities’ responses to a diet intervention, all mice were
maintained on the diet of their microbiota donor for 10 days
following transplant (‘‘Diet 1’’ stage; AMER ad libitum, CRON
restricted) and were then switched to the opposite diet for
11 days (‘‘Diet 2’’ stage). Beginning 21 days after initial coloniza-
tion, all mice in all four groups were maintained on the CRON diet
at the restricted feeding level (‘‘CRON diet’’ stage). At 38 days
post colonization, the CRON1 mice were moved to the AMER-
Target isolator, and each CRON1 mouse was placed in the
cage of an AMER-Target mouse (‘‘Cohousing stage 1’’ in Figures
4A and 4B). Upon cohousing, the amount of the CRON diet was
doubled in these cages to preserve the level of daily caloric
intake the mice had experienced when singly housed. At day
52, the CRON1 mice were returned to their original cages, and
the CRON5 mice were moved to the AMER-Target isolator in
the same fashion (‘‘Cohousing stage 2’’ in Figures 4A and 4B).
At day 66, the CRON5 mice were returned to their original cages.
All mice remained in their original gnotobiotic isolators until the
end of the experiment on day 78 (‘‘Post-cohousing’’ stage).
Bedding was changed with every change in diet or housing.
This protocol yielded mice exposed to one, two, or three
communities by the end of the experiment. Fecal microbiota
were sampled throughout the diet oscillations and housing
changes and profiled by V4-16S rRNA sequencing (Figures 4A
and 4B; Table S1C). Transplantation efficiencies at the ends of
the Diet 1 and Diet 2 stages were comparable to those in gnoto-
biotic mice fed the AMER and CRON diets monotonously (Tables
S6A and S5B).
Before cohousing, in isolation, the fecal microbiota of CRON1
and CRON5 mice changed dramatically in response to 10 days
on the AMER diet. CIV and wCIV increased in these mice, as
did the total relative abundance of AMER-associated OTUs,
while the total relative abundance of CRON-associated OTUs
decreased. Conversely, AMER-colonized mice showed no sig-
nificant response in wCIV and only a small increase in the total
proportional representation of CRON-associated OTUs after
10 days of exposure to the CRON diet. After an additional
17 days (CRON diet stage), both CIV and wCIV were significantly
reduced, but failed to reach the values in either group of CRON-
colonized mice while they consumed the CRON diet. The AMER-
Control mice did not reach the pre-cohousing CIV and wCIV
levels of either group of CRON-colonized mice even after
57 days of consuming the CRON diet (Figures 4C, 4D, and S2;
Table S6B–S6J; also see Figure S2F and Table S7A for OTUs
whose relative abundances were significantly altered by the
diet interventions as defined by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
tests).
Having established that the AMER-colonized mice were un-
able to emulate the configurations of transplanted CRON micro-
biota in mice fed the CRON diet, we next determined whether
sequential cohousing with the CRON1 and CRON5 mice would
strengthen the response of the AMER5 community.
During Cohousing stage 1, phylogenetic diversity increased,
and both CIV and wCIV decreased in the AMER-Target mice
cohoused with CRON1 mice (Figures 4C, 4D, and S2C; Table
S6B, S6C, S6F, S6G, and S6J). These changes reflected in-
creases in the numbers and total relative abundances of
CRON-associated OTUs in the AMER-Target mice’s fecal micro-
biota (Figures S2B and S2D; Table S6E, S6I, and S6J). In
Cohousing stage 2, when AMER-Target mice were caged with
CRON5 mice, phylogenetic diversity and the number of CRON-
associated OTUs increased further and unweighted CIVs
decreased. Nonetheless, the aggregate percent abundance of
CRON-associated OTUs and weighted CIVs did not continue
to change in AMER-Target animals with this second cohousing
(Figures 4C, 4D, and S2B–S2D; Table S6B, S6C, S6E–S6G,
S6I, and S6J). These exchanges of microbes also resulted in
convergence in configurations of the fecal microbiota of
cohoused mice. Hierarchical clustering of Bray-Curtis dissimilar-
ities between the animals’ fecal microbiota grouped them by
their donors and diets. The AMER-Target mice clustered with
the AMER-Control mice before cohousing, with the CRON1
mice during the first cohousing, and with CRON5 mice during
and after the second cohousing (Figure 4E).
Phi-coefficient-based analysis revealed OTUs that were
consistent invaders of each group of mice during the two co-
housing stages (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for analytical methods and tests of statistical significance). This
analysis identified 27 OTUs that passed from the CRON1 mice
Figure 4. Responses to a CRON Diet Intervention in the Context of an Experimental Metacommunity
(A) AMER- and CRON-colonized mice were subjected to diet oscillations and cohousing in a designed metacommunity, during a CRON diet intervention, as
described in the text and Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
(B) AMER-Control mice were only exposed to their human donor’s microbiota. CRON1 mice were exposed to vtheir donor’s community and to an AMER mi-
crobiota. AMER-Target and CRON5 mice were exposed to microbes from all three communities.
(C and D) Mean (±SEM) CIVs (C) and wCIVs (D) for transplanted fecal bacterial communities are shown as a function of dietary and microbial exposures. More
positive CIVs and wCIVs indicate greater representation of more AMER-associated OTUs, while more negative values indicate greater representation of more
CRON-associated OTUs.
(E) Hierarchical clustering groups the fecal microbiota of mice according to diet and history of microbial exposure.

 into the AMER-Target mice during Cohousing stage 1 (Figure 5A;
Table S7B). By the end of Cohousing stage 1, the aggregate rela-
tive abundances of these invading OTUs accounted for 27.1%
of the total community (24.7%–32.1%, range). The 27 OTUs
included seven that were CRON-associated in the human popu-
lation and 11 that had previously displayed greater relative
abundance in the CRON versus AMER diet context in CRON1
mice (i.e., from the comparison of pre-cohousing Diet 1 versus
Diet 2 stages) (Figure 5A; Table S7B). Thus, a variety of
diet-responsive taxa from the CRON1 community established
themselves in an AMER microbiota in the context of a CRON
diet. Many (11/27) of these successful invaders belonged
to the phylum Bacteroidetes, including OTUs assigned to

and 181432), and the genus Alistipes
(213671) (Figures 5A and S3; Table S7B).
During Cohousing stage 2, an addi-
tional 27 OTUs invaded the AMER-Target
microbiota, this time from the CRON5-
colonized mice (Figures 5B and S3; Table
S7C). Six of these OTUs were significantly
CRON-associated in humans, and six
were significantly more prevalent when
the CRON5 mice were fed the CRON diet compared to AMER
diet during the pre-cohousing Diet 1 and Diet 2 stages. By the
end of Cohousing stage 2, these 27 OTUs comprised a mean
of 21.6% (range, 18.9%–23.6%) of the AMER-Target cage-
mates’ fecal microbiota. Again, the Bacteroidetes accounted
for a large proportion of the invading OTUs (11/27), including
Parabacteroides johnsonii (851323), P. goldsteinii (4372003),
B. intestinalis (332732), and B. ovatus (4467447) (Figures 5B
and S3; Table S7C).
During both cohousing stages, invasion was bidirectional. In
Cohousing stage 1, 16 OTUs from the AMER-Target mice
migrated to the CRON1 mice (Figure 5A; Table S7D). Seven of
these had previously shown an increase in relative abundance
92
Cell Host & Microbe 21, 84–96, January 11, 2017
 in the AMER-Target mice when they were switched to the CRON
diet during the pre-cohousing stages. During Cohousing stage 2,
19 OTUs from the AMER5 mice invaded the CRON5 mice, but
nearly half of these (9) actually originated in the CRON1 mice,
including five OTUs that had increased proportional abundance
in the CRON1 mice fed the CRON diet before cohousing (Fig-
ure 5B; Table S7E). Thus, much of the influx of OTUs into
CRON-colonized mice from their AMER-Target cagemates
was made up of OTUs that had shown a preference for the
CRON diet in mice and/or humans. Four OTUs originating in
the AMER5-colonized mice invaded both the CRON1 and
CRON5 mice. The invasion of the CRON mice may be due to
several possible factors. CRON donor communities, though
more diverse than AMER communities, may possess unoccu-
pied niche space. Taxa that successfully transfer from AMER5
mice to CRON1 mice may displace resident taxa due to better
utilization of particular components of the CRON diet than
some resident taxa present in the CRON1 community (Table
S7D). Moreover, some of these invading taxa may maintain their
fitness regardless of the diet by consuming resources available
in both diet contexts or derived from the host (e.g., mucosal
glycans).
Our experimental metacommunity demonstrated that the ex-
change of diet-responsive taxa between hosts can enhance the
extent of a community’s reconfiguration in response to a diet
intervention. This finding raises an obvious question: would
similar community configurations arise from cohousing per se,
regardless of diet, or must the target community’s host be
consuming a CRON diet? One way to determine whether a

DP-associated donor microbiota and a
diet reflective of that DP are both neces-
sary to enable a response to that DP
(i.e., transfer of the relevant OTUs) is to
conduct a cohousing experiment using
a diet that is not associated with the
target or donor microbiota. However, it
is not apparent how to design, a priori,
a diet that is neutral with respect to
the
preferences
of
CRON-associated
and AMER-associated taxa; this would
require knowledge of the overlap be-
tween the CRON and AMER diets at
the
molecular
level
as
well
as
the
resource requirements of each DP-asso-
ciated taxon. Nonetheless, we were able
to explore this question in part by consid-
ering the changes observed in CRON1
mice and CRON5 mice when they came
into
contact
with
the
AMER-Target
mice. During Cohousing stage 1, the
mean CIV of CRON1 mice increased (Fig-
ure 4C; Table S6C, S6G, and S6J), along
with an increase in their mean number of AMER-associated
OTUs (Figure S2E; Table S6D, S6H, and S6J). CRON5 mice ex-
hibited similar increases in CIV and the number of AMER-asso-
ciated OTUs in their communities during Cohousing stage 2
(Figures 4C and S2E; Tables S6C, S6D, S6G, S6H, and S6J).
By these metrics, these two CRON communities became
more AMER-like despite being fed the CRON diet at the same
time. However, metrics incorporating the relative abundances
of bacterial lineages (wCIV, total abundances of CRON-associ-
ated taxa) showed that the CRON mice maintained strong
CRON-like structures. We conclude from these observations
that the CRON diet did not prevent invasion of AMER-associ-
ated taxa into the CRON microbiota. This is consistent with
results from the experiment described in Figure 2A in which
transplanted microbiota from five AMER and five CRON sub-
jects maintained community compositions reflective of their
donors but exhibited large differences in the relative abun-
dances of specific taxa in response the AMER and CRON
diet. Figure 6 summarizes the outcomes the diet switching
and cohousing experiments.
Effects of History of Microbial Exposure on Metabolic
Profiles
There was no statistically significant difference in the percent
weight change between AMER-Control and AMER-Target
mice from the beginning of cohousing to the end of the Post-co-
housing stage (t test, p = 0.082). To characterize the metabolic
effects of microbial exchange in the sequential cohousing exper-
iment, we performed mass-spectrometry-based profiling of 81
Cell Host & Microbe 21, 84–96, January 11, 2017
93
 metabolites in cecal contents and 176 in liver in all animals at the
time of euthanasia (Table S8).
Several metabolites present in cecal contents differenti-
ated AMER-Control animals from AMER-Target, CRON1, and
CRON5 mice (Table S8A). AMER-Target mice exhibited signifi-
cantly increased cecal concentrations of propionate compared
to AMER-Control mice, as well as moderate, but not significant,
increases in acetate. AMER-Control mice exhibited elevated
concentrations of methylmalonylglycine and succinate. This in-
crease may reflect heightened methylmalonyl-CoA metabolism,
in which methylmalonylglycine is produced as a means of purg-
ing excess methylmalonyl-CoA that is isomerized to succinyl-
CoA. In addition, three inositol metabolites (pinitol, chiro-inositol,
and myo-inositol) were significantly higher in AMER-Control
animals than in the other three groups. Pinitol was also detect-
able in the serum of AMER-Control, but not in any of the other
treatment groups. Inositols are present at high levels in a variety
of ingredients that are well represented in the CRON diet,
including fruits, nuts, and grains (Clements and Darnell, 1980).
Moreover, inositol is a commonly used dietary supplement.
Nonetheless, the role of the gut microbiota in metabolizing inosi-
tols is not well understood.
AMER-Target mice had significantly increased hepatic concen-
trations of eight amino acids (leucine/isoleucine, alanine, gluta-
mine/glutamic acid, phenylalanine, tyrosine, ornithine, serine,
proline) compared to AMER-Control mice (p < 0.05, ANOVA
with Tukey’s post hoc tests). The concentrations of these amino
acids in this group were not significantly different from those of
CRON5 mice that served as their final cohousing partners (Fig-
ure 5C; Table S8B). Likewise, liver lactate concentrations were
significantly greater in AMER-Target mice compared to AMER-
Controls (p < 0.0008, Tukey’s post hoc test; Figure 5D). Modest
decreases in pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and citrate levels
were observed in the former compared to latter animals but did
not reach statistical significance in liver (Table S8B). Together,
these findings suggest that mice harboring an isolated AMER
donor community and fed a CRON diet used a greater proportion
of glucose oxidatively, with less glycolytic metabolism to lactate
and less conversion of pyruvate to alanine and other amino acids,
compared to AMER mice that had been exposed to both CRON
microbiota. Conversely, in animals exposed to both the CRON1
and CRON5 microbiota (AMER-Target and CRON5 mice), the
data suggest that a greater proportion of glucose was used for
lactate and amino acid production. These metabolic features
were not observed in the CRON1 group, which had never been
exposed to the CRON5 community and whose intestinal commu-
nities were not as enriched in CRON-associated taxa as in either
CRON5 or AMER-Target mice (Figures 5C and 5D).
DISCUSSION
Long-term DPs play a large role in determining the selective envi-
ronment that the gut microbiota faces, ultimately influencing the
composition and diversity of taxa maintained within the gut
microbial community. In our study, Americans consuming unre-
stricted diets maintained less diverse fecal microbiota than those
of individuals adhering to a plant-rich diet with restricted caloric
intake. Moreover, the AMER individuals’ gut communities were
marked by a lack of many bacterial lineages that are indicators
of the CRON DP. When transplanted into gnotobiotic mice
and faced with a CRON diet intervention, some of these less-
diverse AMER communities mounted community reconfigura-
tions that were weaker than those of their CRON counterparts.
By placing these AMER communities into a model metacom-
munity composed of several CRON communities, we were
able to utilize the dispersal of organisms between coprophagic
mice to enhance the reconfiguration of an AMER individual’s
microbiota in response to a CRON diet intervention.
Humans continuously shed microorganisms; a vivid and
experimentally validated image is that each individual is literally
surrounded by a cloud of his/her microbes (Meadow et al.,
2015). More knowledge is needed about the rates of interper-
sonal exchange of organisms as a function of the ‘‘health’’ of a
microbiota and host. To what extent do health status and
behavior (e.g., hygiene, dietary practices, antibiotic use) impose
selective forces that influence the composition and diversity of
an individual’s gut microbiota, as well as the dispersal of organ-
isms between individuals? Experiments in mice have shown that
multigenerational exposure to a Western diet poor in ‘‘micro-
biota-accessible carbohydrates’’ can lead to extirpation of
specific bacterial lineages (Sonnenburg et al., 2016). In addition,
Cotillard et al. (2013) reported that in humans possessing gut
microbiomes with ‘‘low gene content,’’ 6 weeks of caloric restric-
tion raised gene content to nearly the same levels observed in
individuals with high microbiome gene content, although the
sources of the microbial gene enrichment were not defined.
We may need to evolve our view of ‘‘social’’ diseases to include
an understanding of how a given individual’s gut microbial
community is connected to those of other hosts in a microbial
metacommunity.
The current study illustrates a way of characterizing the extent
to which bacterial dispersal under the most permissive condi-
tions (cohousing of coprophagic mice) impacts diet responses.
An artificial metacommunity provides an opportunity to mine
multiple human microbiota for organisms that are not only re-
porters of responses to diet interventions but also effectors of
host responses to these interventions. Applying this approach
may facilitate preclinical identification of (i) diets capable of
reprogramming human gut microbial functions in practitioners
of other DPs and (ii) consortia of diet-responsive taxa that
may influence the outcomes of given diet interventions. In princi-
ple, constructing experimental metacommunities using donors
exemplifying contrasting phenotypes of interest may also be
useful for capturing taxa that influence other features of host
biology in healthy or diseased states.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human Studies
Human fecal samples were obtained from biospecimen collections assembled
during previous studies (Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Muegge et al., 2011; Ridaura
et al., 2013) as well as from subjects in ongoing studies. Subjects were enrolled
and samples were collected using procedures approved by the Washington
University Human Studies Committee. Fecal samples were frozen at �20�C
within 30 min after collection and placed in a �80�C freezer within 24 hr.
Animal Studies
Protocols used in experiments involving mice were approved by the Washing-
ton University Animal Studies Committee.

 Constructing Representative Diets
Representative CRON and AMER diets were designed based on daily food
journals kept by members of the Calorie Restriction Society and a non-
restricted control cohort. Briefly, 1,000 randomly selected menus of 41 items
from the journals of each cohort were compared to the mean daily intake of
kilocalories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to select the best representative
diets for each DP. Ingredients were then homogenized, after cooking eggs and
meat, and irradiated before feeding to gnotobiotic mice (Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures).
Transplanting Human Fecal Microbiota to Gnotobiotic Mice
Aliquots of pulverized, frozen fecal samples from human donors were resus-
pended under anaerobic conditions in filter-sterilized PBS supplemented with
0.05% L-cysteine-HCl and 0.1% resazurin. A single 200 mL aliquot of this sus-
pension was administered by oral gavage into the stomach of each mouse
within its gnotobiotic isolator. Details of animal husbandry and experimental
design are provided in Results and Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Bacterial 16S rRNA Analyses
DNA was isolated from aliquots of pulverized frozen human feces, mouse fecal
pellets, and mouse cecal contents by extraction with phenol:chloroform:
isoamyl achohol (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The V4 region of
bacterial 16S rRNA genes present in fecal and cecal samples was amplified
by PCR and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq instrument, according to pro-
tocols detailed in Bokulich et al. (2013). OTU abundance data were rarefied to
10,000 reads per sample prior to statistical analyses (also see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures).
Successfully invading OTUs were identified by a multi-step phi-coefficient
analysis performed for each cohousing stage and invasion direction
(i.e., CRON/AMER, AMER/CRON). OTUs invading in the AMER/CRON
direction were defined as those that were significantly (PFDR < 0.05) associated
with (i) the AMER-Target mice (versus their CRON cagemates) prior to cohous-
ing and (ii) samples taken from the CRON-colonized mice during cohousing
(versus samples taken pre-cohousing) with a phi-coefficient R 0.6. OTUs
invading in the CRON/AMER direction were defined as those that were
significantly (PFDR < 0.05) associated with (i) the CRON1 or CRON5 mice
(versus their AMER-Target cagemates) prior to cohousing, (ii) samples taken
from the AMER-Target mice during cohousing (versus samples take pre-
cohousing) with a phi-coefficient R 0.6, and (iii) the AMER-Target mice
(compared to AMER-Control mice) during cohousing (also see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures).
Measurement Metabolites in Mouse Cecal Contents, Serum, and
Liver Samples
Cecal contents were analyzed using non-targeted GC-MS of 69 analytes, tar-
geted UPLC-MS of bile acids, and targeted GC-MS of short-chain fatty acids.
Liver samples were subjected to targeted MS-MS of 176 analytes. Protocols
for MS analyses are described in Ridaura et al. (2013; also see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures).
