Abstract
As bisexual individuals in the United States (U.S.) face significant health disparities,
researchers have posited that these differences may be fueled, at least in part, by negative
attitudes, prejudice, stigma, and discrimination toward bisexual individuals from heterosex-
ual and gay/lesbian individuals. Previous studies of individual and social attitudes toward
bisexual men and women have been conducted almost exclusively with convenience sam-
ples, with limited generalizability to the broader U.S. population. Our study provides an
assessment of attitudes toward bisexual men and women among a nationally representa-
tive probability sample of heterosexual, gay, lesbian, and other-identified adults in the U.S.
Data were collected from the 2015 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior
(NSSHB), via an online questionnaire with a probability sample of adults (18 years and
over) from throughout the U.S. We included two modified 5-item versions of the Bisexuali-
ties: Indiana Attitudes Scale (BIAS), validated sub-scales that were developed to measure
attitudes toward bisexual men and women. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics,
gamma regression, and paired t-tests. Gender, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, income,
and educational attainment were all significantly associated with participants’ attitudes
toward bisexual individuals. In terms of responses to individual scale items, participants
were most likely to “neither agree nor disagree” with all attitudinal statements. Across sex-
ual identities, self-identified other participants reported the most positive attitudes, while
heterosexual male participants reported the least positive attitudes. As in previous research
on convenience samples, we found a wide range of demographic characteristics were
related with attitudes toward bisexual individuals in our nationally-representative study of
heterosexual, gay/lesbian, and other-identified adults in the U.S. In particular, gender

 emerged as a significant characteristic; female participants’ attitudes were more positive
than male participants’ attitudes, and all participants’ attitudes were generally more positive
toward bisexual women than bisexual men. While recent population data suggest a marked
shift in more positive attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women in the general popula-
tion of the U.S., the largest proportions of participants in our study reported a relative lack of
agreement or disagreement with all affective-evaluative statements in the BIAS scales.
Findings document the relative lack of positive attitudes toward bisexual individuals among
the general population of adults in the U.S. and highlight the need for developing interven-
tion approaches to promote more positive attitudes toward bisexual individuals, targeted
toward not only heterosexual but also gay/lesbian individuals and communities.
Introduction
Bisexual individuals commonly report experiencingstigma, prejudice, and discrimination
regarding their sexual identity from both heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals [1, 2]. This
stigmatization of bisexuality among monosexual (i.e., exclusively heterosexual and exclusively
homosexual) individuals has been documented in scientific and community literature as
“biphobia” (or more recently “binegativity” or “anti-bisexual prejudice”) [3–5]. Biphobia
derives in part from heterosexist reaction to sexual expression that is not heteronormative
(same-gender sexual expression), as well as monosexist reaction to sexual expression that is not
monosexual (e.g., sexual expression with more than one gender). Beyond default assumptions
that privilege heterosexuality, negative attitudes toward bisexual groups are also grounded in
monosexism, or the belief that people can only be either heterosexual or gay/lesbian, i.e., one or
the other. Binary conceptions of sexuality and sexual identity can further fuel dismissive and
denigrating attitudes toward bisexual persons, from both heterosexual and gay/lesbian groups
[4].
Thus, while sexual minority persons do share some collective experiences of prejudice living
in a heteronormative and heterosexist society (e.g., [6, 7]) bisexual individuals are additionally
burdened by negative attitudes from gay and lesbian individuals. The deployment of oppressive
structures often create multiple levels of oppressive dynamics, from the dominant group to the
minority group, and also from minority group to other minority groups [8]. In other words,
from a sexual rights perspective,negative attitudes from gay men and lesbian women toward
bisexual individuals can be conceptualized as reinforcing of larger oppressive structures against
non-heteronormative, non-monosexual forms of expression [9, 10]. Anderson & McCormack
note ten forms of “bisexual burden” that may contribute to an increased burden of mental and
other health challenges faced by bisexual individuals [11]. Prior research on social attitudes
toward sexual minority individuals typically aggregate “lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals”
into a single “LGB” or “sexual minority” category, despite the distinct anti-bisexual prejudices
faced by bisexual individuals. Among these, bisexuality is often trivializedas an illegitimate and
transitional “phase” in which the person is assumed to be on their way to a “valid” (i.e., mono-
sexual) identity—resulting in colloquial microaggressions such as “bi now, gay later” [5, 12–
17]. Bisexual individuals are also commonly characterized as sexually promiscuous, even
responsible for serving as a “bridge population” for HIV and other sexually transmitted infec-
tions (STI) from partners of one gender to others [3, 18–20]. This is also related to a broader
discourse on any form of non-monogamy as “risky” in terms of HIV/STI. As such, another

 common stereotype involves equating bisexuality with non-monogamy, and bisexual individu-
als being inherently “incapable” of maintaining monogamous relationships [1, 5].
Impacts of Negative Attitudes on Health
Negative attitudes derived from such stereotypes may impact the health of bisexual individuals,
as they develop into and are enacted in subsequent forms of stigma and prejudice which cumu-
latively contribute to a state of “minority stress” [21]. The deleterious effects of stigma and prej-
udice on the health of sexual minority individuals have been well-documented across both
physiological and psychological domains. Theoretical models on relations between health dis-
parities and poor health outcomes assume that sexual minority individuals experience distinct
elevated levels of stress due to the social stigmatization of their sexual orientation/identity [21,
22]. Broadly, stress can be conceptualized as a biopsychosocial process occurringat three inter-
connected levels: 1) biological (e.g., elevated diastolic blood pressure); 2) psychological (e.g.,
stress affect); and 3) social (e.g., experiences of prejudice) [23]. Such a model demonstrates
intersections between an individual’s social interactions and their physiological health may be
a contributing factor in explaining the highest rates of many adverse health outcomes are
found among bisexual individuals, who experience distinct and multiple levels of sexuality-
related stigmatization.
Research on the etiologies of health disparities among sexual minority individuals, beneath
the surface of “minority stress,” has also highlighted the importance of social support and mate-
rial resources as moderators of stigma-induced stress [22]. Bisexual individuals’ experiences of
biphobia and subsequent marginalization from gay/lesbian, and heterosexual communities
(i.e., sources of social support and resources) place them at elevated risk for physical and men-
tal health disparities [24]. Recent research has documented the existence of a wide range of dis-
tinct health disparities among bisexual individuals, relative to their exclusively heterosexual
and homosexual counterparts [25, 26]. Compared to their gay and lesbian peers, bisexual indi-
viduals report higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders [27, 28], physical and emotional
abuse [29], and substance abuse [30], which are strong predictors of early and excess mortality.
Previous Explorations of Attitudes toward Bisexuality in the United
States
Data from large polling agencies reveal that attitudes toward “homosexuality” and “gays and
lesbians” have become markedly more positive over the past decade [31], both in the U.S. and
throughout much of the world [32]. Previous social and behavioral science researchers have
made efforts to assess attitudes toward bisexuality, as distinct from heterosexuality and hetero-
sexuality, in a range of convenience samples in the U.S. and other contexts [33]. Mohr and
Rochlen developed the Attitudes Regarding Bisexuality Scale (ARBS) with convenience samples
of lesbian, gay, and heterosexual college students and found two factors associated with atti-
tudes towards bisexuality:tolerance and stability [34]. Tolerance determined whether bisexual-
ity was viewed as morally acceptable, whereas stability determined whether bisexuality was
perceived as a legitimate sexual orientation. Attitudes regarding bisexuality varied greatly in
respect to the gender of the bisexual individual; specifically, bisexual men were rated less posi-
tively than bisexual women in studies with other convenience samples of heterosexual college
students [18, 35–37]. Brewster and Moradi developed and psychometrically evaluated another
measure, the Anti-Bisexual Experiences Scale, using a different scaling approach based on data
from convenience samples of bisexual individuals [5]. Their scale development process
involved separate measurements of anti-bisexual experiences directed from heterosexual and

 gay/lesbian individuals, and their findings align with negative attitudinal findings from other
samples [1, 34].
Herek [38] conducted the only prior study using probability sampling to examine adults’
attitudes towards bisexual men and women in the U.S., although his sample was limited to het-
erosexual individuals. Attitudes towards bisexual individuals were less favorable than a wide
range of religious, racial, political, and sexuality groups (e.g., Jewish individuals, Haitian indi-
viduals, pro-choice individuals, lesbian and gay individuals). Indeed, injection drug users were
the only group to be perceived more negatively. Gender differences were observedamong het-
erosexual respondents, with female participants rating bisexual men and women less favorably
than gay/lesbian individuals, and male participants reporting more positive views towards les-
bian and bisexual women than gay and bisexual men. Although strengthened by probability
sampling, the study was limited in that it focused solely on heterosexual individuals’ attitudes
(not those of gay/lesbian individuals’). Additionally, the findings are nearly two decades old
and predate a number of structural and societal changes that have reflected changes in attitudes
among heterosexual individuals toward sexual minority individuals in some ways, including
legislation recognizing the legality of same-sex marriage [39].
Study Aims
Our study aimed to examine attitudes toward bisexual men and women in the general popula-
tion of the U.S., using a probability sample of heterosexual, gay, lesbian, and other-identified
participants from the 2015 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB). We used
abridged versions of the Bisexualities: Indiana Attitudes Scale (BIAS) [40], incorporating two
forms measuring distinct attitudes towards bisexual men and bisexual women—i.e., the BIAS-
m and BIAS-f, respectively. (While numerous gender identities exist outside a male/female
binary, the BIAS specificallymeasures attitudes towards bisexual individuals who identify as
men and women without specific mention of whether these men/women are transgender or
cisgender, as prior studies have documented differences in attitudes between these two
groups.)
The BIAS assesses a number of domains that have emerged in previous studies, including
bisexual men and women being confused or in transition regarding their sexual orientation,
bisexual men and women as hypersexual, and bisexual men and women as vectors of STI. The
current study is innovative not only in terms of sampling, by relying on a large probability sam-
ple of adults from throughout the U.S., but also because it is among the first to examine atti-
tudes toward bisexual men and women in a nationally-representative sample of not only
heterosexual but also gay, lesbian, and other-identified individuals.
Materials & Methods
The National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) is an ongoing population-based
survey of adults and adolescents in the U.S. [41]. The first wave of data was collected in 2009,
and subsequently in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. This paper presents the data from the 2015
NSSHB, which was conducted during November and December 2015, via the KnowledgePanel
of GfK Research (GfK) (Menlo Park, California). Research panels accessed through GfK are
based on a national probability sample established using both random digit dialing (RDD) and
an address-based sampling (ABS) frame. ABS involves the probability sampling of a frame of
residential addresses derived from the U.S. Postal Service’s Delivery Sequence File, a system
that contains detailed information on every mail deliverable address in the U.S. Collectively,
the sampling frame from which participants are recruited covers approximately 98% of all U.S.
households. Randomly selected addresses are recruited to the research panel through a series of

 mailings and subsequently by telephone follow-ups to non-responders when possible. To fur-
ther correct sources of sampling and non-sampling error, study samples are corrected with a
post-stratification adjustment using demographic distributions from the March 2015 Current
Population Survey (CPS), the monthly population survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the
Census considered to be the standard for measuring demographic and other trends in the U.S.
These adjustments result in a panel base weight that was employed in a probability propor-
tional to size selection method for establishing the samples for this study. Oversampling of spe-
cific subgroups are corrected by adjusting the corresponding weights accordingly with the CPS
benchmarks serving as reference points.
Once the sample frame was established, all individuals within that frame received a recruit-
ment message from GfK that provided a brief description of the NSSHB and invited them to
participate. A total of 2,999 adults (ages 18+) completed the survey, including 1,320 from the
general population, 1,230 from an oversample of 18–34 year-olds, and 156 from an oversam-
ple of gay men. Given sufficient participation across sexual identity categories, the oversample
of gay men was excluded in this analysis, resulting in a total unweighted sample of 2,843
adults.
Post-stratification weights, provided by GfK, were used to maximize generalizations. The
post-stratification weights were produced using an iterative proportional fitting procedure that
aligned the study sample to all study benchmark distributions from the March 2015 CPS. All
results hereafter presents the weighted data. As we focused on the attitudes of non-bisexual
individuals about bisexual persons, 33 self-identifiedbisexual male and 61 bisexual female par-
ticipants were intentionally excluded from subsequent analyses. Given the very small number
of transgender participants (N = 5), these individuals were also removed the analyses. The
weighted total sample resulted in 3,221 adults, with 2,434 from the general population and 787
from the 18–34 year-old oversample. A sensitivity analysis excluding the oversample of 18–34
year-old adults was conducted for all analyses. No significant difference were observed,and
therefore, the oversample of 18–34 year-old adults was pooled with adults from the general
population.
Measures
In preparation for survey data collection, we engaged a panel of expert reviewers from a range
of both scientific and community-based organizations who reviewed the original BIAS scales
(26-item BIAS-m sub-scale for male participants, 27-item BIAS-f sub-scale for female partici-
pants) [1, 40]. Previous studies have demonstrated differences in attitudes toward bisexual
women in comparison to bisexual men and, as such, we sought to determine whether this was
the case in a national probability sample. A panel of six expert reviewers helped the researchers
to identify common themes across scale items in order to identify those that tapped into the
most important factors that emerged during prior data analysis [1, 12]. While our pilot study,
as well as other studies, showed significant differences in attitudes toward bisexual men and
bisexual women, the same 5 themes were selected by reviewers as most relevant for both men
and women, specifically:
1. Perceptions of confusion
2. Perceptions of HIV/STI “riskiness”
3. Perceptions of non-monogamy
4. Perceptions of promiscuity
5. Perceptions of bisexuality as temporary

 After examining feedback from reviewers, the study team identified the highest ranked
items and conducted a second level of review with the expert panel. Reviewers agreed, despite
similarity of the scale items, that separate items for attitudes toward bisexual men and bisexual
women are necessary in order to capture potentially important gender differences in a proba-
bility sample.
Table 1 presents the final scale items for the abridged BIAS-m and BIAS-f measures. These
abridged scale items were compiled for the 2015 wave of NSSHB in order to collect data from a
nationally representative sample of self-identifiedheterosexual, gay, lesbian, and other partici-
pants. The Institutional Review Board of the Human Subjects Office at Indiana University—
Bloomington reviewed and approved all study protocols.
For measures of sexual identity, participants responded to the following item:
Which of the following commonly used terms best describes your sexual orientation?
1. Straight/heterosexual
2. Gay, lesbian, or homosexual
3. Bisexual
4. Asexual (I am not sexually attracted to others)
5. Other, please describe [textbox]
In addition to the widely used identity labels of heterosexual, gay/lesbian, and bisexual, the
NSSHB offers participants the opportunity to indicate and briefly describe the other identities;
in previous probability samples of U.S. adults, the other identity is endorsed by approximately
1% of male and 2% of female respondents [42]. As an increasing number of other identified
NSSHB participants have describedtheir orientation as asexual, we have offered this term as a
separate option in recent waves of data collection.We were particularly interested in examining
attitudes among other-identified individuals because, just as diverse individuals are problemati-
cally collapsed together under the auspices of “sexual minorities,” a number of non-monosexual

 identities (e.g., bisexual, pansexual, queer) are sometimes subsumed under the label of “bisex-
ual” [43, 44] and experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice have been found to differ based on the
label endorsed by the individual [45].
As anticipated, based on previous waves of NSSHB data collection, relatively small num-
bers of participants self-identified as asexual (N = 21) and other (N = 15). Among the partici-
pants who identified as other, participants’ self-reported identities included pansexual,
demisexual, gray-asexual, and “I do not identify with any sexual orientation.” A very small
number (N = 3) participants did not provide a textbox response for the other item. As the
small numbers of asexual and other identified individuals did not provide sufficient statisti-
cal power for advanced analyses, we combined these individuals into an aggregate “other”
category.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in sociodemographiccharacteristics between participants who responded to BIAS-
m and/or BIAS-f were presented descriptively. For an overall measurement of attitudes towards
bisexual men and women, we summed the responses for all participants who completed each
BIAS scale, subtracting by the total number of items answered. BIAS-m and BIAS-f were also
summed to generate a total BIAS score among participants who completed both scales. Due to
the right-skewness of the scale response distributions, generalized linear modeling with gamma
distributions (log link) were utilized to assess the association between sociodemographicchar-
acteristics and BIAS scores. For each of the three BIAS scores, pairwisecomparisons by sexual
orientation and race/ethnicity, respectively, using t-tests for weighted survey data were con-
ducted. To test for differences between negative attitudes towards bisexual men versus bisexual
women, weighted paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were conducted on BIAS-m
and BIAS-f scores. All analyses were performed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp. 2013. Stata
Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).
Results
Participants
Table 2 provides an overview of the demographic characteristics reported by participants who
completed the BIAS-m and the BIAS-f measurements. Again, self-identifiedbisexual partici-
pants were intentionally excluded from these analyses since the study focused on the attitudes
of non-bisexual individuals about bisexual persons. For the male version, most participants in
our sample identified as heterosexual or straight (95%, N = 2,885), with a further 3.7% identify-
ing as gay (N = 112) and a remaining 1.2% (N = 36) as other. Proportions were identical for the
female version, with slightly more heterosexual participants completing the sub-scale. For the
BIAS-m scale as a whole, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.911; for the BIAS-f scale as a whole, Cron-
bach’s alpha was 0.909.
Descriptive Findings
Table 3 provides an overviewof the descriptive responses from all participants for each individ-
ual scale item on the BIAS-m and BIAS-f sub-scales. Regarding the response rate for the BIAS
sub-scales, 97.0% responded to both scales, 2.5% did not respond to either scale, 0.02%
responded to BIAS-m but not BIAS-f, and 0.5% responded to BIAS-f but not BIAS-m. In com-
parison to participants who responded consistently to both scales (either both responded or
both non-response), the people who responded to one scale and not the other is extremely

 small (less than 1%). The location of the BIAS-f items before the BIAS-m items may account
for the very slightly higher non-response rate of the BIAS-m items.
In terms of responses, for both male and female sub-scale items, participants were most
likely to “neither agree nor disagree” with attitudinal statements (Table 3). For all items, the
proportions of “neither agree nor disagree” responses were over one-third; indeed, nearly 40%
neither agreed nor disagreed regarding the capability of bisexual men and/or bisexual women
to be “faithful” in a relationship.

 Difference between Overall Attitudes towards Bisexual Men versus
Bisexual Women
Average BIAS scores for participants completing both scales were 13.64 (95% CI: 13.08–14.20)
towards bisexual men and 12.80 (95% CI: 12.25–13.35) towards bisexual women. Negative atti-
tudes towards bisexual men was significantly greater than negative attitudes towards bisexual
women (p<0.001 by both weighted paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test).
Factors Influencing Attitudes toward Bisexual Men and Women
Table 4 presents the relationships between specific demographic characteristics and mean
BIAS scores. Age emerged as a related factor with attitudes toward bisexual men and women.
Participants under the age of 25 years old reported significantly lower BIAS scores; thus, youn-
ger participants reported more positive attitudes (p<0.001). Gender was also a significant fac-
tor, such that, relative to men in the sample, women reported significantly lower scores on the
BIAS-f. There were not; however, any significant gender differences between participants on
the BIAS-m.
Race/ethnicitywas significantly related to the participants’ attitudes toward bisexual indi-
viduals. In terms of the total BIAS measure, White/non-Hispanic participants reported the low-

 and Black/non-Hispanic participants (p = 0.003), as well as Other/non-Hispanic and Black/
non-Hispanic participants. (p = 0.006).
Income was significantly related to participants’ attitudes. In particular, participants who
earned less than $25,000 annually reported significantly higher BIAS mean scores. Thus, higher
income participants were more likely to report more positive attitudes toward bisexual men
and women. Similarly, educational attainment was significantly associated with participants'
attitudes. Participants whose educational attainment was a high school diploma or less
reported significantly higher BIAS scores. Thus, participants with higher levels of educational
attainment were more likely to report more positive attitudes toward bisexual men and
women.
Last, sexual identity was also significantly related to participants’ attitudes. Specifically,
other-identified participants reported the lowest BIAS scores, followed by gay/lesbian partici-
pants and lastly heterosexual participants. Table 6 demonstrates relationships among various
sexual identity categories for both BIAS-m and BIAS-f measures. Overall, sexual minority indi-
viduals (other and gay/lesbian) reported significantly more positive attitudes toward bisexual
men and women than heterosexual participants. This was finding was consistent for both sub-
scales on attitudes toward bisexual men and women.
Discussion
Our findings are among the first to document attitudes toward bisexual men and women
among a probability sample of adults in the general population of the U.S. Our data from the
2015 NSSHB provide a snapshot of attitudes toward bisexual men and women in the U.S. that
is both nationally representative and inclusive not only of self-identifiedheterosexual individu-
als but also, importantly, among individuals of diverse sexual identities. While a small number
of studies have examined attitudes toward bisexual individuals (or bisexuality) in a range of
convenience samples, our paper is only the second that explores such attitudes in a nationally
representative sample, and is the first to do so in a sample of gay, lesbian, and other-identified

 individuals. In the sole prior probability study of heterosexual individuals’ attitudes toward
bisexual men and women, self-reported attitudes (toward bisexual men, in particular) were
extremely negative [38]. As such, our findings represent a “shift” in attitudes toward bisexual
men and women from negative to more neutral in the general population. Further nationally
representative data on attitudes toward bisexual men and women are needed in order to pro-
vide a clearer sense of change over time in such attitudes.
Positive attitudes toward gay and lesbian individuals among heterosexual individuals have
dramatically increased over the past decade [31], both in the U.S. and around the world [32].
In the U.S., every demographic group has seen an increase in acceptance of gay and lesbian
individuals including religious groups, all political parties, and young people [46]. These rates
have remained constant almost a year after the Supreme Court ruling Obergefell v. Hodges
[46]. However, in terms of attitudes toward bisexual men and women, the majority of

 participants in our study remained “middle of the road” and were most likely to report neither
agreeing nor disagreeing with the range of sentiments and stereotypes embedded within the
BIAS items. These responses can be interpreted in a variety of ways, including the participant
not knowing, the participant being unsure, or the participant not caring [47]. Additionally,
mid-point responses may also reflect social desirability bias [48]. While it is encouraging that
most participants did not report more explicitly negative attitudes, that over one-third of par-
ticipants neither agreed nor disagreed with every scale item may also be indicative of a general
ambivalence toward bisexual men and women within the general population [49]. This may be
reflective of larger cultural shifts away from expressing explicitly negative or discriminatory
attitudes toward minority groups, while implicit or unconscious biases may still operate [50].
This may also be partially due to the relative invisibility of bisexual individuals and positive
bisexual role models, relative even to increasing portrayals of gay men and lesbians in media
and social consciousness [3, 28]. It may also reflect respondents’ unfamiliarity with bisexual
people as bisexual men and women are significantly less likely than gay and lesbian individuals
to disclose their identities and behaviors to friends and family members [51, 52].
In terms of specific scale items, the most commonly endorsed belief was that bisexual men
and women are at a heightened risk for HIV/STI. This finding is in line with prior assessments
of attitudes toward bisexual men and women in convenience samples in terms of “sexual riski-
ness” [1], as well as descriptions of “sexual irresponsibility” as a commonly reported anti-bisex-
ual experience among bisexual individuals [5]. This sentiment is likely an artifact from the
early days of the HIV epidemic, in which bisexual men, in particular, were stereotyped as a
“bridge population” between their male partners and their presumably unaware female part-
ners [53, 54]. [1, 5] However, recent research has demonstrated that, in the U.S., the number of
bisexual men who are HIV-positive is likely no greater than the number of heterosexual men
who are HIV-positive [55]; that bisexual men who are HIV-positive report lower proportions
of female sexual partners, and lower rates of sexual intercourse with women, than bisexual men
who are HIV-negative [56]; and that Black men who are gay-identified but behave bisexually
are more likely to use HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) than Black gay men who do not
report sex with women [52]. Taken together, these findings suggest that social discourse about
bisexual men’s viral bridging behavior does not take into account current strategies that bisex-
ual men have developed to minimize risk to themselves and their partners, whether male,
female, or other. Additionally, while it is important to document the existence of health
disparities, researchers and public health professionals are encouraged to be mindful of their
role in perpetuating these stereotypes. Researchers are encouraged to engage with bisexual

 communities in both research design and dissemination in order to ensure that their research
does not cause further unintentional damage to these communities [24].
Several findings on demographic factors associated with self-reported attitudes are parallel
to results from prior studies focused on convenience samples and warrant further discussion
[1, 33]. Gender was significantly associated with self-reported attitudes. Specifically, women
were more likely to report more positive attitudes for bisexual men and women. These findings
are consistent with the larger body of research on attitudes toward “LGB” populations, wherein
women consistently demonstrate more positive attitudes toward sexual and gender minority
groups than men [38, 57]. This may be because, overall, women tend to be less conservative
and look more favorably upon social issues related to equality [58]. Similarly, attitudes toward
sexual minority women are less negative than those towards sexual minority men. Worthen
offers a number of explanations for this “gender gap”
, including the sexualization of bisexual
and lesbian women [59]. As it pertains to our findings, we would also posit that society con-
stantly monitors women’s sexual behavior and uses that behavior to define and control women
(e.g., being labelled as a “slut” versus a “prude”) [60]. Being made aware of the damage that this
constant regulation may have on the way that they are able to experience their life may make
women less prone to posing similar regulations on the lives of others. Additionally, more
women identify as bisexual than men and women have also been thought to be more sexually
fluid than men [14]. It is possible that women are less judgmental about bisexuality because
many have considered their own bisexuality and/or sexual fluidity. Additionally, as men are
traditionally expected to more rigidly conform to gender explicitly heteronormative norms and
stereotypes, their attitudes may be markedly less “fluid” than women’s [61], though attitudes
about stringent masculinity expectations are changing rapidly in youth populations in the U.S.
and elsewhere [62].
Age also emerged as significant, specificallythat lower age (under 25 years) was associated
with more positive attitudes. These findings are consistent with recent qualitative cohort
research on bisexual men, in which those in the 18–24 year old age cohort reported more
acceptance from their heterosexual and gay and lesbian peers, than those in the older cohorts
[63]. Contemporary youth are more likely to consider and define their sexuality and gender in
ways that are less rigid than older generations. This is reflected both in national surveys that
have found an increasing number of youth adopting non-monosexual identity labels (e.g.,
bisexual, pansexual, queer) and further highlighted by the number of young celebrities who
have publicly claimed similar labels [64]. Youth may be more sensitive and resistant to stereo-
types about those who adopt a bisexual label based on reflections of their own sexualities.
In relation to sexual identity, this may also explain why other-identified participants were
more likely than others to report more positive attitudes toward bisexual men and women.
Along the same lines as above, those who have questioned their identity and do not define
within ‘traditional’ categories may relate to and be more sensitive about similar stereotypes. It
is positive that gay/lesbian-identifiedindividuals responded with less negative attitudes toward
bisexual men and women than heterosexual participants. However, their attitudes were also
less positive than other-identified individuals. This may be further evidence that nominally
inclusive “LGB” support mechanisms may not be as relevant to bisexual individuals as they are
to gay men and lesbian women [1]. Additionally, regarding sexual prejudice more broadly,
oppressive structures operate through multiple levels, and to a large extent monosexism might
be a fundamental source of oppressive attitudes faced by bisexual individuals. It is important to
also consider that monosexism is dominated by heteronormative discourse thus, placing non-
heterosexual forms of expression in antithesis to heteronormativity but also in conflict with
each other.

 In relation to race/ethnicity, Black/non-Hispanic participants were most likely to report
more negative attitudes toward bisexual men and women. This is interesting given that, in
many convenience samples of gay and bisexual men, Black men are significantly more likely to
identify as bisexual than as gay [53, 65]. More negative attitudes among Black participants may
also be the result of recent sensationalized negative media portrayals of Black behaviorally
bisexual men “on the down low,” which has been alluded to in prior qualitative research [53].
In our pilot research, biracial/multiracialparticipants reported more positive attitudes toward
bisexual men and women than their counterparts [1]. Null significancemay be due to statistical
power, due to the relatively smaller number of participants who report 2+ races/ethnicitiesin
our nationally representative sample, and this issue may be explored in future research.
Both educational attainment and income level were associated with participants’ attitudes.
Specifically, lower levels of income were reported with less positive attitudes toward bisexual
men and women. This was also true of education, in that lower educational attainment was
associated with less positive attitudes toward bisexual men and women. When away from
home in an academic setting, students are often encouraged to question their beliefs, tolerate
and accept diversity, and sometimes explore their sexuality. They may also be exposed to others
whose sexual lives differ from their own. This exposure (whether in their lives or to the lives of
others) may reduce judgement that they may have had about an otherwiseunknown group [2].
Limitations
As with all social science research, this study is not without limitations. Future research would
benefit from exploring attitudes toward bisexual transgender, non-binary, gender-queer, and
other groups of individuals who may not identify as male or female. While some perhaps have
not included these non-binary identities in previous studies on bisexuality, due to the assump-
tion that the numbers of people who would report these identities is too low, it may be the case
that we simply have not afforded individuals the option to report such identities consistently in
research.
Additionally, as in prior waves of NSSHB, small numbers of individuals self-identifiedtheir
sexual orientation as other. Unfortunately, we were not able to capture a large enough sub-
sample size to explore the diversity among individuals who are captured under the other
umbrella (e.g., similarities or differences among asexual, pansexual, and others who do not
self-identify their sexual orientation with “traditional” labels, or who do not label themselves at
all). An interesting finding that emerged, however, is that attitudes toward bisexual men and
women among the aggregated other individuals were the most positive of all sexual identity
sub-groups. Future research on sexuality-related attitudes and concerns among other-identi-
fied individuals is warranted.
Conclusions
Although it was not the aim of our study to directly examine previously established health dis-
parities, the pervasive absence of positive attitudes toward bisexual men and women may be
one of a number of other complex factors that continue to drive higher rates of adverse health
outcomes among bisexual men and women. Researchers should continue to explore these
unique health disparities in the context of social attitudes toward bisexual men and women in
the U.S. After documenting the existence of an absence of positive attitudes toward bisexual
men and women in the general U.S. population, we encourage future research to explore inter-
vention opportunities focused on assessing, understanding, and eliminating biphobia—for
example, among clinicians and other serviceproviders—and determining how health dispari-
ties among bisexual men and women can be alleviated.
