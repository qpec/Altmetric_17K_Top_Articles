Abstract
Objective—Describe the process of enacting and defending strong tobacco packaging and 
labelling regulations in Uruguay amid Philip Morris International’s (PMI) legal threats and 
challenges.
Methods—Triangulated government legislation, news sources and interviews with policy-makers 
and health advocates in Uruguay.
Results—In 2008 and 2009, the Uruguayan government enacted at the time the world’s largest 
pictorial health warning labels (80% of front and back of package) and prohibited different 
packaging or presentations for cigarettes sold under a given brand. PMI threatened to sue Uruguay 
in international courts if these policies were implemented. The Vazquez administration maintained 
the regulations, but a week prior to President Vazquez’s successor, President Mujica, took office 
on 1 March 2010 PMI announced its intention to file an investment arbitration dispute against 
Uruguay in the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. Initially, the Mujica 
administration announced it would weaken the regulations to avoid litigation. In response, local 
public health groups in Uruguay enlisted former President Vazquez and international health groups 
and served as brokers to develop a collaboration with the Mujica administration to defend the 
regulations. This united front between the Uruguayan government and the transnational tobacco 
control network paid off when Uruguay defeated PMI’s investment dispute in July 2016.
Conclusion—To replicate Uruguay’s success, other countries need to recognise that strong 
political support, an actively engaged local civil society and financial and technical support are

 important factors in overcoming tobacco industry’s legal threats to defend strong public health 
regulations.
INTRODUCTION
Since the 1990s, the tension between trade and tobacco control has escalated1 as new legal 
rules concerning intellectual property and foreign investment have enabled investors 
(including tobacco companies) to challenge domestic public health policies in international 
trade and investment arbitration courts.2–4 Tobacco companies lobbied states in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and World Trade Organization (WTO) to file trade disputes 
against other member states’ tobacco control policies.56 Subsequently, tobacco companies 
directly challenged public health policies using investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS) 
mechanisms in trade and investment agreements7 and used the threat of legal action8 to 
dissuade governments from implementing tobacco control policies.9
Partially in response to trade challenges, tobacco control advocates formed a transnational 
tobacco control network, consisting of health advocates, health organisations, academics, 
lawyers and donors to increase exchanges of information and services.10 This network 
combines characteristics of global civil society,11 epistemic communities1213 and advocacy 
networks.14 This network supported the creation of the WHO Framework Convention on 
Tobacco Control (FCTC)15 and assisted governments in implementing it,16–19 which has 
accelerated the adoption of tobacco control regulations,20–23 including pictorial health 
warning labels (HWLs) on cigarette packages.24 The fact that the FCTC does not clearly 
prioritise health over trade125 forced this network to adapt and combat emerging pressures of 
trade on tobacco control.
In 2004, Dr Tabaré Vazquez, an oncologist, was elected president and made reducing 
tobacco consumption a high priority. Supported by strong local advocates, Uruguay became 
the first Latin American country to establish 100% smokefree environments in all 
workplaces and public places,26 prohibit misleading descriptors on cigarette packages and 
adopt pictorial HWLs covering 50% of the front and back of the package27 (table 1). As in 
other countries,28–30 Philip Morris International’s (PMI) Uruguayan subsidiary Abal 
Hermanos (Abal) responded to the prohibition by colour-coding cigarette packages (eg, 
replacing Marlboro Lights with yellow Marlboro packages). In 2008 and 2009, the 
Uruguayan government responded by implementing the world’s strongest (at the time) 
tobacco packaging and labelling regulations, requiring pictorial HWLs covering 80% of the 
front and back of the package31 (figure 1) and that cigarette brands be sold in a single pack 
presentation.32 (The single pack presentation permitted only one variant of each cigarette 
brand which prohibited the colour-coding of ‘light’ and ‘mild’28–3033 or menthol33 variants). 
PMI then threatened and sued Uruguay in domestic and international courts. With strong 
political support, an actively engaged local civil society and the transnational tobacco 
control network that provided financial and technical support, Uruguay overcame these legal 
challenges and defended its regulations, serving as a model for future public health 
successes.

 METHODS
Between August 2014 and June 2016, we reviewed Uruguayan tobacco control legislation 
(available at https://parlamento.gub.uy/), government and health group reports (https://
www.google.com.uy) and newspaper articles (www.elpais.com.uy) using standard snowball 
searches34 beginning with search terms ‘advertencias sanitarias’, ‘el comercio 
internacional’, ‘tratado bilateral de inversion’, ‘propiedad intellectual’, ‘marcas’, ‘Philip 
Morris’ and ‘Abal Hermanos,’ as well as key dates and specific actors. Between November 
2014 and July 2015, we attempted to recruit 26 interviewees via email and telephone and 16 
agreed to be interviewed (four denied our requests and six never responded after multiple 
requests). The 16 interviewees included seven Uruguayan tobacco control advocates, three 
congressmen, five Ministry of Health officials and one Ministry of Foreign Relations 
official. The interviewees agreed to waive their anonymity in accordance with a protocol 
approved by the University of California, Santa Cruz Committee on Human Research. 
Results were triangulated and thematically analysed through standard process tracing 
frameworks.35
RESULTS
Abal (PMI) domestic and international legal threats
Between September 2008 and June 2009, Abal sent five letters to the Health Ministry (table 
1) arguing the packaging and labelling regulations were unconstitutional, beyond the 
executive’s jurisdiction and violated Uruguay’s obligations under two treaties governing 
trademark and investment rights, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial 
Property and the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPS).36–38 Abal argued the regulations violated a 1991 Uruguay-Switzerland bilateral 
investment treaty (BIT) and threatened to file a complaint with the World Bank’s 
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) seeking compensation 
for damages.
Vazquez administration’s response to Abal’s first threats (2008–2010)
Despite Abal’s threats, the administration remained firm on the regulations. The Health 
Ministry recognised trade and investment agreements presented new complexities beyond 
their expertise and requiring discussions with the Ministries of Economy and Foreign 
Affairs.3940 Their support41 for the Health Ministry’s approach to HWLs was necessary 
since each ministry had different priorities and stakeholders. President Vazquez’s support,41 
as well as public support for tobacco control and Uruguay’s international commitments to 
the FCTC42 were vital to defending the regulations.
Health officials contacted local health groups, the Centro de Investigacion para la Epidemia 
del Tabaquismo (CIET, Tobacco Epidemic Research Centre) and the Sociedad Uruguaya de 
Tabacología (SUT, Uruguayan Tobacco Society) for information on the regulations’ 
international legal implications; these organisations asked the US-based Campaign for 
Tobacco Free Kids (TFK, supported by the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use43 
and the Framework Convention Alliance (FCA) for help.44–48

 Political support in the legislature
In addition to support by the executive branch, there was strong support for the regulations 
in the Uruguayan congress. Legislators confirmed local tobacco control organisations, CIET 
and SUT, and President Vazquez changed the culture of tobacco control in Uruguay and 
achieved strong political consensus for the regulations49–51 assisted by strong public 
support,45–485253 and a reduction in hospital admissions following Uruguay’s smokefree 
law.54 This assistance proved critical because unlike other countries,55–57 congress did not 
attempt to weaken the regulations.49–51
Abal’s domestic legal challenge
After failing to force the Vazquez administration to withdraw the regulations, between 2009 
and 2012 Abal unsuccessfully filed two lawsuits58–60 to block the single pack presentation 
on the grounds that the Health Ministry did not have jurisdiction to issue the ordinance and 
that only congress could restrict Abal’s constitutional rights. Then Abal unsuccessfully sued 
to block the requirement for the 80% pictorial HWLs, again arguing the Health Ministry did 
not have authority to issue the decree6162 (table 1).
PMI ratchets up threats against new Mujica administration (2010–2015)
On 1 March 2010, while the domestic legal challenges were pending and a week before new 
President Mujica took office, PMI filed a request for arbitration with ICSID under the 
Uruguay-Switzerland BIT.63 PMI argued the regulations expropriated PMI’s trademark 
property rights without compensation, the company was not provided fair and equitable 
treatment under a stable regulatory environment, and was not dealt with properly by 
Uruguayan courts (table 2). PMI sought damages which it later quantified as US$25.7 
million, and requested the tribunal order Uruguay to suspend the regulations, an unusual 
request that was later dropped as investor-state disputes usually only award monetary 
damages.64 PMI’s statements concerning intellectual property and investment in trade 
agreements were magnified by front page stories in major Uruguayan newspapers.6566 The 
ICSID’s Secretary General registered PMI’s challenge as within the jurisdiction of the 
Centre on 26 March 2010.67
Mujica administration’s response to PMI’s second set of threats (2010–2015)
Mujica’s administration told the media that they were ‘reviewing’ the issue.65 Between 
April and June 2010, reports surfaced that PMI was privately negotiating an amendment to 
the regulations with the Ministers of Economy, Foreign Affairs and Health.4449 While it is 
unclear what occurred during these private meetings, on 23 July 2010 Health Minister 
Daniel Olesker (2010–2015) announced the regulations would be amended by eliminating 
the single pack presentation rule and reducing the size of HWLs from 80% to 65%.68
Early mobilisation by local health groups in Uruguay—In February and March 
2010, CIET and SUT published opinion-editorials in newspapers denouncing PMI’s attempt 
to intimidate the government.6970 In March 2010, during a WHO meeting, CIET convened a 
meeting with TFK and FCA, Uruguayan government officials, and WHO lawyers to request 
support defending the regulations.4449

 After learning about the government’s private negotiations with PMI, CIET alerted the 
media and met with government officials to argue for maintaining the regulations.4447 In 
June and July 2010, CIET continued publishing opinion-editorials and participated in media 
interviews highlighting the industry’s interference.53 In June, CIET wrote former President 
Vazquez stating changes to the regulations would reverse progress in Uruguay and set a bad 
precedent for the region.44 In July, CIET met with Senator Lucia Topolanski, President 
Mujica’s wife, to explain the risks of weakening the regulations. She told CIET to speak 
directly with the president. CIET requested a meeting and was eventually invited (together 
with a delegation of international lawyers) to discuss the regulations in August4447–4953 
(table 1).
Response from former President Vazquez—On 24 July 2010, a day after Health 
Minister Olesker announced the government intended to weaken the regulations, the press 
and CIET contacted former President Vazquez who appeared on television to express 
disappointment in the Mujica administration and oppose weakening the regulations.71 Luis 
Almagro, Minister of Foreign Affairs, responded, telling reporters the government remained 
committed to fighting tobacco but was uncertain of the regulations’ legality under 
international trade law.72
A few days later, Mujica said in a radio interview that the government’s approach to the 
regulations had been ‘no simple thing’ and that his government faced ‘a clever and powerful 
enemy’ and was seeking other options to avoid contracting ‘lawyers at $1500 an hour for 
several years’.73
A week later, Mujica visited Vazquez to privately discuss PMI’s legal threats and the 
regulations, when Vazquez reportedly urged Mujica to defend the regulations and seek 
international support.73 Mujica reportedly acknowledged that Vazquez made some 
convincing arguments but that he was still concerned about the legal costs of fighting PMI, 
and was continuing to evaluate the situation.
International support to the Uruguayan government—CIET requested TFK’s 
assistance to help the government defend the regulations.4449 In response, TFK wrote 
President Mujica on 16 July 2010, (a week before the public announcement of the weakened 
regulations) offering legal support and requesting that his administration not settle with PMI.
74 On 28 July 2010, (four days after the public announcement of the weakened regulations), 
TFK coordinated a letter signed by several international health groups urging Mujica to 
defend the regulations.75 This support and Vazquez’s encouragement helped Mujica 
reconsider defending both regulations in August 2010.75
Bloomberg financial support: On 10 August 2010, the international delegation of lawyers 
met high level government officials and congressmen to argue against settling. They told the 
government that it had a strong legal case76 because international law, including the 
Uruguay-Switzerland BIT, recognised governments’ authority to protect public health. 
Uruguay’s legal position was strengthened by being a party to the FCTC, which 
recommends the implementation of strong regulations.77 With authorisation from the

 Bloomberg Foundation, TFK offered financial assistance to the Uruguayan government to 
help support Uruguay’s legal defence.
Generating international political support for Uruguay: In late August, TFK reiterated to 
the Uruguayan government the widespread global support to Uruguay’s case.78 In 
September 2010, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the WHO regional office 
for the Americas, became the first inter-governmental health organisation to formally 
support Uruguay.79 PAHO’s Executive Committee passed a resolution which specifically 
expressed support for Uruguay implementing FCTC recommended policies and urged 
member states to oppose tobacco industry interference.79 PAHO also offered technical 
support to the Health Ministry, focusing on the Conference of the Parties (COP), the FCTC’s 
governing body, scheduled to be held in Uruguay in November 2010.
In late September and early October, TFK reiterated its offer of financial and technical 
support to defend the regulations and develop a communications strategy80 (table 1). On 4 
October 2010, the Foreign Minister held a press conference to announce the government 
would fight PMI and accept the financial support provided by Bloomberg though TFK.81 
From this point on, the Mujica administration took a strong stance against PMI and the 
investment challenge to ensure the regulations would be protected.
The fourth COP meeting in Uruguay: The FCTC COP, which had been scheduled 2 years 
earlier, was held in Punta del Este, Uruguay in November 2010, providing further 
international support to Uruguay. During the COP, international health groups informed 
governments and generated international media coverage of PMI’s attempts to intimidate 
Uruguay82 (table 1). Uruguay produced and tabled the Punta del Este Declaration, supported 
by the FCTC Parties attending the COP (except the EU, China and Japan), declaring the 
rights of sovereign countries to prioritise public health regulations over trade agreements.25 
The declaration specifically recognised the Parties’ concern regarding industry attempts to 
undermine government tobacco control regulations and Parties’ right and commitment to 
implement the FCTC.25 The EU successfully proposed adding the clause, ‘provided that 
such measures are consistent with the TRIPS agreement.’25
This international support sent a clear signal that Uruguay was not alone in defending its 
regulations against PMI. Former President Vazquez and President Mujica addressed the 
COP, acknowledging the assistance from the transnational tobacco control network and the 
courage required to defend the regulations.2583 The WHO held a press conference and 
announced it would provide scientific evidence supporting the regulations and coordinate 
briefings related to trade and tobacco control to assist other governments in defending their 
regulations against legal challenges.44
On 15 November 2010, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced he had 
offered $500 000 to help defend Uruguay’s regulations against the investment challenge and 
personally called President Mujica to offer his support.84 This ongoing assistance included 
legal collaboration with the law firm retained by the Uruguayan government to represent it 
throughout the ICSID proceedings.

 PMI investment challenge
After the ICSID Secretary General registered PMI’s investment dispute on 26 March 2010, 
the Uruguayan government and PMI spent a year selecting arbitrators for the tribunal, which 
was constituted in March 2011.85 In September 2011, Uruguay filed a memorandum arguing 
the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim as PMI was required under the treaty 
to litigate in domestic courts before seeking arbitration,85 which the arbitrators denied in 
2013.85 The next 2 years each party presented their arguments to the tribunal, which 
reviewed the case. In January and March 2015, the WHO and FCTC Secretariat86 and 
PAHO87 presented separate amicus briefs expanding on the scientific evidence and public 
health justification for the regulations. President Tabaré Vazquez, re-elected in 2014 and 
resuming office in March 2015, appointed a new team to coordinate the legal defence for the 
oral hearings on the merits of the case held in Washington, DC in October 2015.
In July 2016, ICSID rejected PMI’s claims and ruled Uruguay had the sovereign right to 
protect public health.88 ICSID ruled the regulations did not substantially deprive PMI’s 
value of investment, were not arbitrary, reasonable and expected regulations, and handled 
properly in Uruguayan domestic courts85 (table 2). The tribunal noted PMI’s total costs were 
US$16.9 million while Uruguay’s total costs were US$10.3 million and ruled PMI had to 
pay US$7 million of Uruguay’s cost and an additional US$1.5 million for ‘all of the fees and 
expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID’s administrative fees and expenses’,85 leaving the 
government to pay $3.3 million. Bloomberg through TFK funded $1.5 million of the $3.3 
million legal defence.
DISCUSSION
The Uruguayan case illustrates how strong political support, an actively engaged local civil 
society, and international financial and technical support are important factors in overcoming 
tobacco industry legal threats to defend public health policies.8990
Strong political support
The Vazquez and Mujica administrations demonstrated strong political commitments to 
tobacco control and ensuring the regulations were protected. President Vazquez’s leadership 
and prioritising tobacco control helped alter the culture of tobacco control in Uruguay, 
demonstrating the importance of political champions in advancing tobacco control measures. 
Uruguay’s Health Ministry established supportive communication with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, illustrating the importance of developing interagency alliances and a whole-
of-government approach91 to implement the FCTC and resolve differences at the 
intersection of health and trade.
Active engagement by local civil society
Similar to successful tobacco control advocacy efforts in other countries,17579293 local civil 
society groups developed close relationships with government officials, provided evidence-
based information to policy-makers, and closely monitored swift government actions and 
industry activity to advance tobacco control in Uruguay. When the Mujica administration 
considered weakening the regulations to avoid an expensive legal battle with PMI (whose

 2010 annual net revenues exceeded $64 billion versus Uruguay’s $32 billion GDP73 local 
health groups mobilised support from former President Vazquez and international health 
groups to produce a strong united response to support defending the regulations.
Support by the transnational tobacco control network
The united front between local and international health organisations demonstrates the value 
of the transnational tobacco control network in combating tobacco industry interference and 
supporting FCTC implementation,139495 especially in low-income and middle-income 
countries.192057 Even though international health organisations could have responded sooner 
to the government’s legal concerns, organisations such as TFK, WHO, and PAHO have 
become more knowledgeable about trade and investment issues. Advocacy networks and 
epistemic communities have continuously improved the links between science and advocacy 
to advance tobacco control policy13149496; the Uruguay case highlights how this network 
strengthened the links between trade and tobacco control to combat emerging pressures of 
trade on health. The network recognised the importance of legal precedents in tobacco 
control,97 contributing to their decision to support Uruguay’s regulations as a global tobacco 
control issue.
International financial and technical support
Bloomberg’s financial contributions highlight that trade and investment disputes create 
substantial burdens for small and financially vulnerable countries, which can be strong 
incentives for governments to settle these lawsuits. As a result, international organisations 
have focused more attention and resources towards this growing concern, especially in low 
and middle-income countries. In particular, in March 2015 Bloomberg and Bill Gates 
launched a $4 million ‘anti-tobacco trade litigation fund’ to assist countries in drafting 
legislation ‘to avoid legal challenges and potential trade disputes’, and if challenges arise to 
provide funds for actual litigation defence expenses.98
Domestic and international legal implications
PMI’s losses to Uruguay in domestic and international courts are the latest in a string of 
losses at the national and international level. Constitutional courts upheld strong tobacco 
control policies in fourteen countries.17199399 In particular, the Australian,100 UK101 and 
Indian102 High Courts upheld strong packaging and labelling policies, concluding similarly 
to the 2016 ICSID Uruguay ruling, that the registration of tobacco company trademarks did 
not prevent governments from restricting their use and imposing such restrictions was not 
expropriating their intellectual property rights. The EU Court of Justice also upheld the EU 
Tobacco Products Directive103 that grants the authority for each EU member to implement 
plain packaging104 and an arbitration tribunal dismissed as an ‘abuse of rights’ a BIT 
investment challenge filed by PMI against Australia’s plain packaging law on jurisdictional 
grounds.105
PMI’s loss to Uruguay in ICSID, along with other defeats, provides greater legal clarity 
surrounding a country’s sovereign right to implement public health regulations. While there 
is no binding precedent in international arbitration law, the broader value of each award can 
contribute to the development and understanding of investment treaty law vis-a-vis tobacco

 control.106 By highlighting the importance of the FCTC in justifying evidence-based 
tobacco control measures, ICSID’s ruling should assist other countries, including New 
Zealand, Canada, Norway, South Africa, Malaysia, Turkey, India, Panama, Brazil, Ecuador 
and Chile, which, as of February 2017, were implementing or had announced plans to 
introduce similar tobacco packaging and labelling regulations.107108
A more direct way to minimise the tobacco industry’s ability to threaten governments would 
be eliminating the application of ISDS mechanisms in relation to tobacco (and public health 
more broadly)4 in trade and investment agreements. Without the ISDS mechanism in the 
Uruguay-Switzerland BIT, PMI would have had to convince a WTO member to challenge 
Uruguay’s regulations. Forced to lobby WTO member states to file trade disputes can also 
backfire; after tobacco companies paid the fees for the Ukraine government to challenge 
Australia’s plain packaging policy, health advocates convinced the new government to 
withdraw the claim because Ukraine had no tobacco trade with Australia.109 Ten months 
after Australia announced the plain packaging proposal, PMI moved ownership of its 
Australian operations from Switzerland to Hong Kong to challenge Australia’s plain 
packaging policy under a 1993 Australia-Hong Kong BIT.110 This treaty shopping also 
failed when the investment dispute was rejected on jurisdictional grounds.111
LIMITATIONS
Top government officials in the president’s office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
declined requests to be interviewed for this study, limiting the complete understanding of 
how the Mujica administration responded to tobacco industry legal threats. To protect 
attorney-client privileges policy-makers in the Health Ministry and Foreign Affairs Ministry 
could not discuss legal advice given to the President surrounding the PMI investment 
challenge against Uruguay.
CONCLUSION
To replicate Uruguay’s success, other countries need to recognise that strong political 
support, an actively engaged local civil society, and financial and technical support are 
important factors in overcoming tobacco industry legal threats to defend strong public health 
regulations. Uruguay’s historic legal victory should provide legal clarity for other countries 
interested in implementing similar tobacco packaging and labelling regulations.

 What this paper adds
What is already known on this subject?
►
Tobacco companies have threatened governments over their packaging and 
labelling laws with international investment lawsuits since the 1980s.
What important gaps in knowledge exist on this topic?
►
Historically, some countries have dropped or delayed strong packaging and 
labelling rules in the face of legal threats from the industry but Uruguay, a 
small middle-income country, successfully resisted these threats with strong 
political leadership and support from the transnational tobacco control 
network.
What does this study add?
►
This is the first case study of how a tobacco company tried using investor 
protection provisions in an international trade and investment treaty in order 
to intimidate a government into withdrawing, weakening or delaying 
progressive tobacco packaging and labelling regulations. Uruguay illustrates 
how strong political will at the national level with support from the 
transnational tobacco control network helped a small and financially 
vulnerable country confront the tobacco industry in an international 
investment dispute to defend its public health regulations.

Table 2
Summary of Philip Morris International’s (PMI) investment dispute and International Centre for Settlement of 
Investment Disputes’s (ICSID) ruling85
PMI’s claims
Tribunal ruling
Tribunal quotes
(1) Regulations 
expropriate PMI’s 
property rights without 
compensation
a.) Regulations did not 
substantially deprive PMI’s value 
of investment as a.) PMI could 
continue selling tobacco in 
Uruguay and
b.) The state can exercise its right 
to regulate in the public good 
(police powers)
c.) The registration of PMI’s 
trademarks does not grant them 
the right to use those trademarks
‘As long as sufficient value remains after the Challenged Measures are 
implemented, there is no expropriation. As confirmed by investment treaty 
decisions, a partial loss of the profits that the investment would have yielded 
absent the measure does not confer an expropriatory character on the measure.’ 
(P 286)
‘Protecting public health has long since been recognised as an essential 
manifestation of the State’s police powers’ (P 291)
‘The Tribunal notes that there is nothing in the Paris Convention that states 
expressly that a mark gives a positive right to use’ (P 260)
‘nowhere does the TRIPS Agreement, assuming its applicability, provide for a 
right to use’ (P 262) ‘The Claimants (PMI) also argue that a trademark is a 
property right under Uruguayan law which thus accords a right to use. Again, 
nothing in their argument supports the conclusion that a trademark grants an 
inalienable right to use the mark.’ (P 266)
‘The Tribunal concludes that under Uruguayan law or international conventions 
to which Uruguay is a party the trademark holder does not enjoy an absolute 
right to use, free of regulation, but only an exclusive right to exclude third 
parties from the market so that only the trademark holder has the possibility to 
use the trademark in commerce, subject to the State’s regulatory power’ (P 271)
(2) Regulations are 
arbitrary and not 
supported by evidence 
so they do not accord 
PMI with fair and 
equitable treatment
Regulations were not arbitrary as 
they fulfilled Uruguay’s national 
and international legal obligations 
for protecting public health under 
the FCTC
‘It should be stressed that the (Challenged Measures) have been adopted in 
fulfilment of Uruguay’s national and international legal obligations for the 
protection of public health’ (P 302)
‘For a country with limited technical and economic resources, such as Uruguay, 
adhesion to the FCTC … represented an important if not indispensable means 
for acquiring the scientific knowledge and market experience needed for the 
proper implementation of its obligations under the FCTC’ (P 393) ‘In these 
circumstances there was no requirement for Uruguay to perform additional 
studies or to gather further evidence in support of the Challenged Measures’ (P 
396)
(3) Regulations do not 
meet PMI’s legitimate 
expectations of a stable 
regulatory environment
Given the harmful effects of 
tobacco, it would be reasonable 
to expect stronger regulation of 
tobacco over time
‘In light of widely accepted articulations of international concern for the 
harmful effects of tobacco, the expectation could only have been of 
progressively more stringent regulation on the sale and use of tobacco products. 
Nor is it a valid objection to a regulation that it breaks new ground.’ (P 430)
(4) Uruguayan courts 
have not dealt properly 
with PMI’s domestic 
legal challenges and 
there was a denial of 
justice
The domestic rulings may appear 
unusual but investment tribunals 
should not act as courts of appeal 
to national courts to find a denial 
of justice
‘In general, when considering procedural improprieties arbitral tribunals have 
adopted a high threshold for a denial of justice. For a denial of justice to exist 
under international law there must be ‘clear evidence of … an outrageous 
failure of the judicial system’ or a demonstration of ‘systemic injustice’ …’ (P 
500)
