ABSTRACT
Background and objective: Malignant pleural effusion
(MPE) affects >90% of mesothelioma patients. Research
on MPE has focused on its physical impact on breathless-
ness; MPE is rich in growth mediators but its contribution
to tumour biology has not been investigated. We aimed to
examine the potential effects of MPE in promoting growth,
migration and chemo-resistance of mesothelioma.
Methods: Pleural fluid samples from 151 patients
(56 mesothelioma, 60 metastatic pleural cancer and
35 benign) were used. Seven validated human mesothe-
lioma cell lines and three primary cultured mesotheli-
oma lines were employed.
Results:
Pleural
fluid
from
mesothelioma
patients
(diluted to 30%) consistently stimulated cell prolifera-
tion (trypan-blue cell viability assay) in five mesotheli-
oma
cell
lines
tested
by
(median)
2.23-fold
over
controls (all P < 0.0001). The fluid also induced cell
migration by (median) 2.13-fold in six mesothelioma
cell lines using scratch-wound assay. In a murine flank
model of mesothelioma, tumour infused with daily
instillations of pleural fluid grew significantly faster
over saline controls (median 52.5 cm2 vs 28.0 cm2 at
day 13, P = 0.028). Addition of MPE (diluted to 30%) to
culture
media
significantly
protected
mesothelioma
from cisplatin/pemetrexed-induced cell death in all
three cell lines tested (median fold reduction of 1.29,
1.98 and 3.90, all P < 0.001 vs control). The growth
effects of matched pleural fluid and cultured mesotheli-
oma cells from the same patients did not differ signifi-
cantly from unmatched pairs.
Conclusion: This ‘proof-of-concept’ study reveals potent
biological capabilities of malignant pleural fluid in mes-
othelioma pathobiology.

INTRODUCTION
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an incurable cancer
that kills one person every 3 h in the UK and every
12 h in Australia. The World Health Organization pre-
dicts that the incidence of mesothelioma will continue
to rise rapidly especially in developing countries. Most
(>95%) mesothelioma patients present with a malig-
nant pleural effusion (MPE), which is often recurrent
during the patients’ disease course. It is associated with
significant breathlessness that impairs quality-of-life
and is troublesome to control.1
Studies on MPE to date have focused on its physical
effects in inducing dyspnoea, and its best management.
MPE arises from plasma extravasation from leaky vascu-
lature in the visceral and parietal pleura. The fluid is
exudative and has been shown to contain abundant
growth factors, for example vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF)2 and
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β),3 as well as cyto-
kines that promote tumour proliferation, for example
IL-6,4
IL-8,
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
(MCP-1)5 and others. These molecules are present in
significantly higher concentrations in the MPE than in
corresponding sera, implying their local production

SUMMARY AT A GLANCE
Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is often viewed as
a by-product of cancer with breathlessness as the
only significant consequence. Its production and
role in cancer biology are unclear. This study pro-
vides ‘proof-of-concept’ evidence revealing potent
biological capabilities in cancer progression. Further
understanding of MPE may uncover exciting thera-
peutic possibilities.

 from the pleural tumours. In mesothelioma patients
with an MPE, the tumour cells are bathed in this fluid
and its biologically potent proteins.
MPE is conventionally viewed by clinicians as a by-
product of cancer development. Why mesotheliomas,
or indeed other metastatic pleural cancers, produce
large quantities of pleural fluid has not been explored.
This study examines, for the first time, the biological
capabilities of MPE fluid in promoting key pathobiolo-
gical features, especially proliferation, migration and
chemo-resistance of mesothelioma. We hypothesize
that malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) produces
pleural fluid, which has potent biological activities,
furthering tumour progression. The result of this proof-
of-concept study may challenge traditional belief that
MPE is an ‘innocent bystander’ in pleural malignancies
and establish the contribution of MPE in the cancer
biology of mesothelioma.
METHODS
Pleural fluid samples
Pleural fluid samples (n = 151) from patients with
MPM (n = 56), metastatic pleural carcinoma (n = 60)
and benign pleural diseases (n = 35) were randomly
selected from the Australian Mesothelioma Biobank
cohort (Table 1). The study was approved by the Sir
Charles Gairdner Hospital Research Advisory Commit-
tee
(2009-104/2020,
2011-109/2125,
2012-005/2019,
2012-038/2092 and 2012-156/2121).
Measurements of pleural fluid protein, pH, glucose,
lactate
dehydrogenase
(LDH)
levels
and
standard
microbiological culture were performed in most (116 of
the 151) samples as per the British Thoracic Society
Pleural
Disease
Guidelines6
(Tables
2,
S1
(Supplementary Information)).
Pleural effusion classification
The hospital integrated clinical system,
outpatient
clinic letters and radiology images were interrogated by
a clinician (S.L.L.). The diagnosis for each pleural effu-
sion was categorized into three groups: MPE from mes-
othelioma, MPE from metastatic pleural carcinomas
and benign effusions. Further details on diagnostic
classifications
are
described
in
Appendix
S1
(Supplementary Information).

 Mesothelioma cell culture
Established

cell
lines
(JU77,
LO68,
ONE58, STY51, GAY2911 and NO36 from BW Robinson
(Perth, Western Australia) and MSTO-211H from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA,
USA)) were used in this study. Cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s
Modified
Eagle
Medium
(DMEM)
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented
with L-glutamine (4 mmol/L), penicillin 100 U/mL and
streptomycin 100 μg/mL (all from Invitrogen) and 10%
foetal calf serum (FCS; Serana Australia, Bunbury,
Australia) at 37�C with 5% CO2. Primary mesothelioma
cells were established from pleural effusion samples as
per methods of Manning et al.7
In vitro cell proliferation assay
Proliferation of mesothelioma cells grown in vitro was
assessed by three techniques: trypan blue exclusion
test of cell viability,8 methylene blue proliferation
assay9 and crystal violet colony formation assay.10 Cells
were serum-starved for 24 h before assays were per-
formed. Cells grown in the same standard DMEM with
either 10% or 0% FCS served as controls. In all of the
assays conducted, we diluted the pleural fluid to 30%
(v:v). Our pilot experiments revealed that as the opti-
mal
concentration
for
demonstrating
proliferative
effects on mesothelioma cells. The proliferation assays
are
described
in
further
detail
in
Appendix
S1
(Supplementary Information).
In vitro cell migration assay
In vitro scratch-wound assays were performed as
described.11 The protocol for this assay is further
described in Appendix S1 (Supplementary Information).
In vivo animal model
A well-validated flank model of mesothelioma was
employed.12 Human mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells
(106/mouse) were injected subcutaneously into the
hind flank of 6–8-week-old nude athymic mice (BALB/
c-Foxn1nu/Arc)
(Animal
Resources
Centre,
Perth,
Australia). Tumour size was determined by taking two
perpendicular diameter measurements using micro-
callipers. When the tumour size reached approximately
20 mm2, six daily intratumoral injections (maximum
allowed by local ethics committee guidelines) of 200 μL
pleural fluid or saline were administered. Animal
weights and tumour size were monitored until tumour
size of one of the groups reached 100 mm2. The animal
experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Com-
mittee of the University of Western Australia (RA/3/
100/976).
In vitro apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was quantified using Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate
(FITC)
apoptosis
detection
kit
(BD Biosciences, North Ryde, Australia) as per the
manufacturer’s
instructions.
Experimental
details
regarding
the
assay
are
further
explained
in
Appendix S1 (Supplementary Information).
Statistical analysis
Prism 5 statistical software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA,
USA) was used. Significant differences between groups
were
determined
by
Student’s
t-test
and
Mann–
Whitney test for parametric and non-parametric data,
respectively. Tumour growth curves were compared
using two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Mann–
Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to
detect significant differences at each time point of the
tumour growth curve. A P-value of <0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Mesothelioma pleural fluid potently induced
cell proliferation in vitro
Addition of mesothelioma MPE fluid induced prolifera-
tion of mesothelioma cells in a time- and dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 1A,B) in preliminary experi-
ments. Subsequent experiments were performed over
48 h in the presence of 30% (v:v) of MPE fluid. MPE of
56 mesothelioma patients was applied to cultured mes-
othelioma cells, and consistently induced significant
cell proliferation (P < 0.001) in all five cell line tested
(Fig. 1C). The fold increase in proliferation from addi-
tion of MPE fluid (over serum-free controls) was rela-
tively consistent among the cell lines tested: JU77
(median 2.92-fold increase over controls, interquartile
range
(IQR):
2.33–3.46),
LO68
(2.56-fold,
IQR:
2.26–2.89),
MSTO-211H
(2.23-fold,
IQR:
1.96–2.44),
GAY2911 (2.19-fold, IQR: 1.73–2.45) and NO36 (1.50-
fold, IQR: 1.36–1.60).
Mesothelioma MPE fluid stimulated
mesothelioma cell migration in vitro
Addition of MPE fluid induced a consistent and signifi-
cant increase in cell migration in each of the six meso-
thelioma cell lines tested: LO68 (median percentage of
wound closure 50.1%, IQR: 41.2–68.9), JU77 (68.8%,
IQR:
52.4–87.9),
NO36
(56.2%,
IQR:
44.8–67.5),
GAY2911 (63.9%, IQR: 51.28–96.7), ONE58 (50.3%, IQR:
35.2–55.1) and STY51 (35.21%, IQR: 27.7–47.8) (all
P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2).
Mesothelioma MPE fluid enhances tumour
proliferation in vivo
A subset (n = 26) of the mesothelioma MPE from the
in vitro study were randomly selected to assess the
effect of the fluid on MM cell growth in the flank
model using athymic nude mice. Tumours injected/
bathed with MPE fluid from mesothelioma grew sig-
nificantly faster compared with saline-injected controls
during the period of fluid injections (P = 0.0002).
Upon cessation of MPE injections, tumour growth of
the two groups began to converge, further confirming
that the accelerated tumour growth during the treat-
ment period was related to the delivery of MPE fluid
(Fig. 3A).

 into ‘high inducers’ and ‘low inducers’ (n = 13 each
group). The in vivo growth stimulation effects of the
high and low inducers were compared (Fig. 3B).
Tumours injected/bathed with high inducer MPE fluid
grew significantly faster than those from the low inducer
and saline group (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). At days
11 (P = 0.044), 13 (P = 0.009), 15 (P = 0.043) and
18 (P = 0.031), tumour size between groups was signifi-
cantly different, with the largest difference of 29 cm2
between high responders MPE versus saline groups
(day 11).

fluid and cells are obtained from the same or different
patients. Primary cultures of mesothelioma cells were

thelioma cells from the three patients were treated with
MPE fluid from the same three subjects. A twofold
increase in cell proliferation (over serum-free controls)
was observed after 48 h in all matched and unmatched
pairs of cells/fluid. No significant difference in cell pro-
liferation was observed between matched samples and
cross-over
pairs
(Fig.

To assess if the mesothelioma cell proliferation
depends specifically on MPE fluid from mesotheli-
oma,
the

were
repeated
using pleural fluid from non-mesothelioma aetiolo-
gies, namely MPE fluid from metastatic pleural carci-
nomas and from benign effusions. Both types of fluid
were able to induce mesothelioma cell proliferation

mas by an increase of 1.42–2.79 fold (vs serum-free

and

Within the benign effusion group, no significant dif-
ferences were observed among fluids from different
subcategories (Fig. S1C, Supplementary Information).
Rate of cell migration was increased when treated
with pleural effusion of other carcinomas and benign

We have conducted a comparison of proliferation
and migration rates with different types of pleural fluid
and cell lines by Spearman’s correlation analysis. No
consistent correlation was found between the prolifera-
tion and migration data. (Table S2, Supplementary
Information).
DISCUSSION
This study provides proof-of-concept data on the
potent and diverse biological roles of MPE fluid in mes-
othelioma. MPE fluid significantly induces growth of
mesothelioma cells in vitro and in mice, promotes cell
migration and protects mesothelioma cells from effects
of chemotherapy agents. The study included a large
cohort of human samples and the findings were con-
sistent in the many primary and established mesotheli-
oma cell lines tested. The clinical relevance of the
potent biological properties in mesothelioma MPEs will
warrant future research.
MPE can complicate most cancers and affect over a
quarter of a million people in the USA alone each year.
MPE can arise from metastatic pleural cancers (one in
four of breast and lung cancer patients) and primary
pleural malignancies, especially mesothelioma. Meso-
thelioma kills 3000 patients in the UK each year; over
250 000 patients in Europe are expected to die from
mesothelioma within these three decades. The WHO
predicts an exponential rise in mesothelioma deaths in
developing countries in coming decades because of the
unregulated use of asbestos.
MPE is the commonest presentation of mesotheli-
oma; up to 95% of patients suffer from a pleural effu-
sion during their disease course. In the largest study of
MPE in mesothelioma (n = 390), we found that even
after pleurodesis approximately 70% of patients had
radiological evidence of fluid reaccumulation; about
half of them required further pleural interventions.13
Mesothelioma
characteristically
proliferates
on
the
parietal and visceral pleural surfaces. Many of the
tumour cells are intimately bathed in MPE fluid. Intra-
cavitary drug delivery studies have shown that mole-
cules within the cavity can penetrate readily into the
first few millimetres of the tumour, reaching tumour
cells beyond the immediate surface.14
This study provides strong evidence that MPE fluid is
biologically potent which contrasts with the conven-
tional view that MPE is an ‘innocent’ by-product of
pleural cancer that only causes dyspnoea by altering
respiratory mechanics. Our findings are not unexpected.
Numerous studies have shown that MPE fluids contain
rich amounts of growth factors, cytokines and chemo-
kines, each of which has been shown to induce meso-
thelioma and/or lung cancer proliferation. Even in its
diluted form (to 30%), the MPE fluids induced signifi-
cant growth over and above cells cultured in 10% FCS,
the standard positive control in cell proliferation experi-
ments in all primary and established mesothelioma cell
lines used. Importantly we have provided in vivo evi-
dence that the effect is reproduced in mice, and that the
fluid that induced more cell growth in vitro also did so
in vivo, a strong validation of the bench findings.
Mesothelioma has a strong predilection in spreading
along the pleural surfaces. Our findings support the
hypothesis that MPE fluid may promote this character-
istic. First, we found that MPE supports proliferation of
mesothelioma cells in cultured media and thus likely
free-floating cancer cells within clinical effusions. Free-
floating mesothelial cells from pleural fluid have been
shown to settle into new, especially wounded, sites on
serosal surfaces.15 Second, our wounding experiments

 suggest that MPE fluids promote migration of mesothe-
lioma cells along tumour edges to extend directly into
new sites.
Pemetrexed (or raltitrexed, a similar compound), cis-
platin and bevacizumab are the only chemotherapeutic
combination regimes that have been proven in rando-
mized
trials
to
prolong
survival
of
mesothelioma
patients.16,17 Nonetheless, approximately 50% of meso-
thelioma patients show a meaningful clinical response
to chemotherapy; no accurate predictors exist for che-
motherapy response. We found that the presence of
MPE impairs the cytotoxic effects of pemetrexed/cis-
platin therapy in vitro; the clinical relevance of this
finding requires investigation. Studies on ovarian can-
cer also suggest that malignant peritoneal fluid protects
tumour cells from TRAIL-induced cell death and apop-
tosis.18,19 Exploration of the underlying biological mech-
anism may be of interest to basic researchers whilst the
presence/absence of fluid or its in vitro chemo-
resistance profile may interest clinical investigators.
Identification of the molecule(s) within the MPE that
drives the biological responses will be the logical step.
Our cross-over experiments and the finding that other
carcinoma effusions can promote mesothelioma cell
proliferation suggest that the driving compounds are
not unique to mesothelioma. Our finding that MPE
could be segregated into those with high or low prolif-
eration potential profiles could present a starting point
to delineate the fluid biochemical profiles that drive
mesothelioma growth. Whether the fluid biological
tests (e.g. proliferation capacity) may predict patients’
disease
course
(e.g.
survival
or
chemotherapy
response) warrants further investigation.
Our study has limitations and the results must not
be over-extrapolated. This study is designed to prove
the concept that MPE fluid is a biologically potent
component of the tumour environment in mesotheli-
oma. Clearly, MPE is not a pre-requisite in mesotheli-
oma pathogenesis as there are patients who never
develop an MPE. Whether active removal of fluid
improves survival and chemotherapy response will
require
testing
in
animal
models
and
humans
(although the latter will require large number of sub-
jects to adjust for confounders).
Overall, our observations raise interesting hypotheses
worthy of further investigation. Previous studies have
shown that MPE fluid has the capacity to increase vas-
cular permeability,20 thus perpetuating further effusion
formation. We hypothesize that mesothelioma induces

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) partially protects against cisplatin/pemetrexed-induced cell death. Flow cytometry analysis
of three different malignant mesothelioma (MM) cell lines following treatment with drug alone or drug and MPE, illustrating the
percentage of late apoptotic cells. The presence of MPE have significantly reduced the percentage of dead cells in all cell lines tested
(***P < 0.0001, **P = 0.0055). Pooled data are from three independent experiments (control n = 15 and MPE n = 26).

 allows transport of these proteins along and into the
pleural tissues, promoting proliferation, metastasis as
well as a feedback loop for further cytokine/growth fac-
tor production. This surge in pleural fluid further attri-
butes to the distribution and survival of the detached
malignant cells.
