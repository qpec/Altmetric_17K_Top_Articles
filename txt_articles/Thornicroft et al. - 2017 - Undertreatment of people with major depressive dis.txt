 The Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study indicated that major
depressive disorder (MDD) ranked as the second leading cause
of years lived with disability in the world and the first to fourth
leading cause (out of nearly 300 considered) in each region of
the world.1 These high estimates are because MDD has both high
prevalence (estimated by the Global Burden of Disease 2010
investigators to be the 19th most common disease in the world)1
and high severity, and a relatively high proportion of individuals
with long illness duration.2–4 Only a minority of people with
MDD receive any treatment, despite MDD being a leading cause
of disability that also significantly worsens the impact of
comorbid non-communicable diseases.5,6 There is an increasing
awareness that MDD can be reliably diagnosed and treated in
primary care settings using antidepressant medications and/or
brief structured psychological therapies,7 but substantial barriers
exist to this care being delivered. These include supply-side factors
(for example, policies to invest resources, and consequent scarce
mental health services, community and human resources), as well
as demand-side issues (for example, lack of awareness of MDD as
a treatable illness, and stigma and social exclusion associated with
lower rates of help-seeking).8,9 Substantial economic costs are
the consequence both for people with MDD10 and for society,11
because of low rates of treatment and recovery.12 In this context,
the aim of this paper is to present findings from the World Mental
Health (WMH) Surveys quantifying: (a) the 12-month prevalence
of DSM-IV13 MDD in household surveys in 21 countries world-
wide; (b) the proportion of those people who are aware that they
have a problem serious enough to need treatment and who believe
that treatments exist that could help them; (c) the proportion of
the latter individuals who actually receive treatment (‘contact
coverage’); and (d) the proportion of this treatment that meets
minimal standards for adequacy.
Method
Participants
Data come from the World Health Organization (WHO) WMH
surveys, a series of 23 community epidemiological surveys
administered in 21 countries. These included 10 countries
classified by the World Bank in 200914 as low or middle income
(Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Iraq, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Peoples Republic of China (PRC), Peru and Romania) and 11 high
income (Argentina, Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the USA). The majority of
surveys were based on nationally
representative household
samples. Three were representative of all urban areas in their
countries (Colombia, Mexico, Peru); two were representative of
selected regions in their countries (Japan, Nigeria); and four were
representative of selected metropolitan areas in their countries
(Sao Paulo in Brazil; Medellin in Colombia; Murcia in Spain;
Beijing-Shanghai in PRC).

Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of
disability worldwide.
Aims
To examine the: (a) 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV MDD;
(b) proportion aware that they have a problem needing
treatment and who want care; (c) proportion of the latter
receiving treatment; and (d) proportion of such treatment
meeting minimal standards.
Method
Representative community household surveys from 21
countries as part of the World Health Organization World
Mental Health Surveys.
Results
Of 51 547 respondents, 4.6% met 12-month criteria for
DSM-IV MDD and of these 56.7% reported needing
treatment. Among those who recognised their need for
treatment, most (71.1%) made at least one visit to a service
provider. Among those who received treatment, only 41.0%
received treatment that met minimal standards. This resulted
in only 16.5% of all individuals with 12-month MDD receiving
minimally adequate treatment.
Conclusions
Only a minority of participants with MDD received minimally
adequate treatment: 1 in 5 people in high-income and 1 in
27 in low-/lower-middle-income countries. Scaling up care
for MDD requires fundamental transformations in community
education and outreach, supply of treatment and quality of
services.

Mental Health Survey collaborators – see the Appendix for details.
 Trained lay interviewers administered the interviews face to
face in the homes of respondents aged 18 years or older and
assessed MDD using a fully structured diagnostic interview that
produces validated diagnoses of common DSM-IV disorders.13
Standardised interviewer training and quality-control procedures
were used in each survey. Informed consent was obtained before
administering interviews. The institutional review boards of the
organisations coordinating the surveys approved and monitored
adherence with procedures for informed consent and protecting
human participants. Full details of the WMH Survey methodology
are available elsewhere.15
To reduce respondent burden, the interview was divided
into two parts. Part I, which assessed core mental disorders
including MDD, was administered to all respondents. Part II,
which assessed additional disorders and correlates including
service use, was administered to all Part I respondents who met
criteria for any Part I disorder plus a probability subsample of
other Part I respondents. Part II interviews, the focus of the
current report, were weighted by the inverse of their probabilities
of selection into Part II and additionally weighted to adjust
samples
to
match
population
distributions
on
the
cross-
classification of key sociodemographic and geographic variables.
Further details about WMH sampling and weighting are available
elsewhere.15
Measures
Mental disorders
Mental disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Version 3.0,16 a fully
structured lay-administered interview generating lifetime and
12-month prevalence estimates of 20 mood, anxiety, behaviour and
substance use disorders. The WMH CIDI interview translation,
back-translation and harmonisation protocol required culturally
competent bilingual clinicians to review, modify and approve
key phrases describing symptoms.17 However, no attempt was
made to go beyond DSM-IV criteria to assess depression-
equivalents that might be unique to specific countries. The latter
expansion might have led to a change in results, although previous
research has shown that the latent structure of major depression is
quite consistent across countries.18–20 Masked clinical reappraisal
interviews with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
(SCID)21 were carried out in four WMH countries. Good
concordance was found with diagnoses based on the CIDI.22
MDD was defined as meeting lifetime DSM-IV/CIDI criteria for
a major depressive episode and not meeting lifetime DSM-IV/
CIDI criteria for broadly defined bipolar disorder (bipolar I–II
or subthreshold). As detailed elsewhere,23 our definition of
subthreshold bipolar disorder includes both hypomania without
history of a major depressive episode and subthreshold hypomania
with a history of a major depressive episode.
Treatment
Respondents were asked whether they ever obtained professional
treatment for ‘problems with their emotions, nerves or use of
alcohol or drugs’ and, if so, whether they did so in the past 12
months. Those with 12-month treatment were asked whether they
saw a mental health specialty treatment provider (psychiatrist,
psychologist, other mental health professional in any setting,
social worker or counsellor in a mental health specialty treatment
setting, used a mental health hotline), general medical treatment
provider (primary care doctor, other general medical doctor, any
other healthcare profession seen in a general medical setting) or
non-medical treatment provider (religious or spiritual advisor,
social worker or counsellor, any other type of healer) for a mental
health problem. The treatment provider categories offered were
the same across countries. A more detailed description of WMH
12-month treatment measures is presented elsewhere.24
The analyses reported here focus on respondents who met
DSM-IV criteria for MDD at some time in the 12 months before
interview. The definition used of minimally adequate treatment
was that of Wang et al,24 using evidence-based guidelines25–27 that
consisted of receiving either pharmacotherapy (51 month of a
medication, plus 54 visits to any type of medical doctor) or
psychotherapy
(58
visits
with
any
professional
including
religious or spiritual advisor, social worker or counsellor). The
decision to have four or more physician visits for pharmacotherapy
was based on the fact that for medication assessment, initiation
and monitoring, four or more visits are generally recommended
during the acute and continuation phases of treatment. We
required at least eight sessions for psychotherapy based on the fact
that clinical trials showing efficacy have generally included eight
or more visits. Any respondent in continuing treatment was
regarded as having met this definition.
Statistical analyses
Survey sampling weights were applied in all analyses so that
respondents reflected nationally representative samples in terms
of sociodemographic characteristics within each country. Standard
errors were estimated using the Taylor series linearisation method
implemented in the SAS software survey procedures to adjust
weighting andclustering. To test for differencesbetweenhigh-income,
upper-middle-income, and lower-middle- and low-income country
groups, in relation to the key variables of interest related to the
aims of the paper, w2 tests were applied. Statistical significance
was evaluated using two-sided 0.05-level tests.
Results
The characteristics of the study sites are shown in Table DS1. The
weighted average response rate across all countries was 71.2%.
A total of 51 547 respondents were assessed for 12-month MDD
and treatment.
Prevalence rates
Across all countries, an average of 4.6% of respondents met 12-month
criteria for DSM-IV/CIDI MDD (Table 1). As in most community
epidemiological surveys, MDD prevalence was higher in high-income
(5.2%), than upper-middle-income (4.7%) or low-/lower-middle-
income (3.2%) countries. Given what we know about sample bias,
reporting bias and CIDI validity, these are likely conservative
estimates.
Recognition of need for treatment
An average of 56.7% respondents with 12-month MDD across
surveys reported that they recognised that they needed treatment.
It is noteworthy that this recognition is greater in high-income
(64.9%), than upper-middle-income (52.2%) countries and is
substantially
lower
in
low-/lower-middle-income
countries
(34.6%). This means that only one out of every three people with
depression in low-/lower-middle-income countries recognised a
need for treatment.
Obtaining treatment once need is recognised
Among people with depression who recognised their need for
treatment, most (71.1%) made at least one visit to some service
120
Thornicroft et al
 Undertreatment of people with major depressive disorder
provider for their emotional problems (including visits to
religious advisors or traditional healers). Again, there was a
gradient, with the treatment proportions being much higher in
high-income (77.9%), than upper-middle- (59.6%), or low-/
lower-middle-income (52.6%) countries.
Treatment adequacy
Among patients who received treatment, 41.0% met criteria for
minimally adequate treatment, again with a gradient by country
income (44.2%, 36.7% and 20.5%, respectively in high-, upper-
middle-,
and
low-/lower-middle-income
countries).
Among
people with MDD (i.e. those who did or did not receive
treatment) only 16.5% received minimally adequate treatment
(22.4%, 11.4% and 3.7%, respectively, in high-, upper-middle-,
and low-/lower-middle-income countries).
The results for differences between high-income, upper-
middle-income, and lower-middle- and low-income country
groups showed that all countries within an income group were
significantly
different
from
other
country
groups
at
the
P50.001 level for all of the five treatment-related variables shown
in Table 1 namely: 12-month prevalence of MDD; perceived need
for treatment; any treatment received in 12 months; and the two
measures of minimally adequate treatment.
Discussion
These results show that several different classes of barriers exist to
people with MDD receiving minimally adequate treatment and
that the combined effect of these barriers is that only a small
minority of people with MDD receive minimally adequate
treatment.
Limitations
Several limitations of this study need to be kept in mind in
interpreting these results. The response rates in the WMH surveys
varied widely and included some response rates that fell below
levels usually considered acceptable. We attempted to control for
differential response through post-stratification adjustments, but
it remains possible that survey response was related to the
presence and severity of mental disorders or treatment in ways
that were not corrected.
A second potential limitation is that the reliability and validity
of diagnoses made with the WMH CIDI may vary across
countries. Although acceptable concordance has been observed
between diagnoses made with the CIDI compared with masked
clinical
re-interviews,
such
studies
have
been
conducted
exclusively in Western countries. It remains possible that the
accuracy of CIDI diagnoses could be worse in other countries.

 Thornicroft et al
One distinct possibility is that there may be a lower relevance of
CIDI symptom descriptions in non-Western cultures or greater
reluctance to disclose or endorse having emotional problems.
For example, some people with a major depressive episode might
not have experienced this as primarily emotional, and may rather
have understood this as disordered sleep or as somatic distress.
Third, without corroborating data on service use we cannot
determine the accuracy of self-reported treatment use or how this
validity may differ across specific sectors or clinical, socio-
demographic and cultural groups. WMH surveys attempted to
minimise such inaccuracies by using commitment probes (i.e.
questions measuring a participant’s commitment to the survey)
and excluding respondents who failed to endorse that they would
think carefully and answer honestly. Nevertheless, potentially
biased recall of service use remains possible and may have led to
underestimation of unmet need for treatment. Finally, in spite
of the unprecedented scope and size of the WHO WMH survey
initiative, some analyses involved small numbers of respondents,
leading to imprecision of some estimates.
Fourth,
there
were
diminishing
response
rates
within
countries as income increases. As many of the results are discussed
in terms of income categories, this is a potential confounding
factor for the findings. It is possible that the differences across
income categories are actually a reflection of greater selection bias
in high-income countries, with participants with greater service
use potentially being more likely to respond to the survey.
Fifth, some of these surveys were conducted over a decade ago,
and it is possible that treatment rates in these countries may have
changed substantially since then. We consider this unlikely
however, since periodic data on service provision collected for
WHO ATLAS and AIMS purposes shows relatively few such
changes over the recent decade.
Implications
Within these constraints, the results support previous reports in
identifying a large ‘treatment gap’ for people with MDD.28,29
Notably the overall prevalence rates of MDD are somewhat greater
in high- than in middle- or low-incomes countries, yet all the
service utilisation rates are far worse in the low-income settings,
namely the perceived need for treatment among people with
MDD, and the proportions of people with MDD who receive
any, or any minimally adequate treatment. The issue of perceived
need for treatment is especially intriguing, as the results show that
in overall terms even if acceptable treatment were available to
people with MDD, only about a half (56.7%) felt that they had
a need for treatment, and that this proportion fell to about a third
(34.6%)
in
low-/lower-middle-income
countries.
Previous
research shows that this recognition is related to the persistence
and severity of depression and is higher among women, the young
and people with higher education.30 This strongly suggests that
efforts to decrease the treatment gap for depression need to
address both scaling up the supply of services and supporting
people with depression and their family members to recognise
that they have the condition and that it is treatable.
Calls
for
scaling
up
mental
healthcare
to
date
have
insufficiently emphasised the quality of services.31 Although the
criteria used in this study to assess the minimal adequacy of
treatment were ad hoc and may need to be refined in future, the
results indicate clearly that there are grounds to consider much
treatment currently provided to people with MDD (‘contact
coverage’) as falling short of the criteria for evidence-based
treatment (‘effectiveness coverage’).32 One consequence of failing
to attend to the quality of care is that this may contribute to
low rates of help-seeking if local services for people with mental
illness have a poor reputation, and another consequence is likely
to be high rates of treatment drop-out before treatment is
completed.33
Quality
improvement
initiatives,
such
as
the
widespread adoption of the evidence-based WHO mhGAP
Intervention Guide, are needed to deal with these problems.7,34,35
Providing treatment at the scale required to treat all people
with MDD is an imperative, not only for decreasing disability
and death by suicide, but also from a moral and human rights
perspective.36 These WMH survey findings make it clear that
success in attacking the problem of unmet need for treatment of
people with MDD will require addressing issues at several levels:
low rates of recognition of their problem by people with
depression, low rates of consultation by people who do recognise
that they have such a mental illness, barriers to access treatment37
and poor treatment adequacy. Each of these problems requires a
distinct intervention, or set of interventions, and all of these
interventions are necessary to improve access to quality treatment
for people with depression, including e-health and m-health treat-
ment options that may be relevant in low- and middle-income
countries. None of these alone will suffice.
The Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2020
adopted by the World Health Assembly38 provides the political
commitment for these actions, although the human and financial
resources
deployed
within
most
low-
and
middle-income
countries are still too low to achieve improvement in the provision
of treatment for MDD and other mental disorders. In the recently
adopted United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, mental
health was for the first time explicitly recognised within the
concept of Universal Health Coverage.39,40 It is clear that
providing effective services for people with depression, integrated
into general health services, is a vital element of basic healthcare
provisions.41 As we now have evidence for effective and feasible
interventions
suitable
for
low-,
middle-
and
high-income
countries,7 we call upon national and international organisations
to make firm and time-bound commitments to make adequate
resources available for scaling up the provision of mental health
services so that ‘no one is left behind’.39
