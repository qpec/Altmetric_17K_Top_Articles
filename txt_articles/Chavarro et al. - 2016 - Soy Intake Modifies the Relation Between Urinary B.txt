Context: Experimental data in rodents suggest that the adverse reproductive health effects of
bisphenol A (BPA) can be modified by intake of soy phytoestrogens. Whether the same is true in
humans is not known.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether soy consumption modifies the relation
between urinary BPA levels and infertility treatment outcomes among women undergoing assisted
reproduction.
Setting: The study was conducted in a fertility center in a teaching hospital.
Design: We evaluated 239 women enrolled between 2007 and 2012 in the Environment and
Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study, a prospective cohort study, who underwent 347 in vitro
fertilization (IVF) cycles. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and provided up to 2
urine samples in each treatment cycle before oocyte retrieval. IVF outcomes were abstracted from
electronic medical records. We used generalized linear mixed models with interaction terms to
evaluate whether the association between urinary BPA concentrations and IVF outcomes was
modified by soy intake.
Main Outcome Measure: Live birth rates per initiated treatment cycle were measured.
Results: Soy food consumption modified the association of urinary BPA concentration with live birth
rates (P for interaction � .01). Among women who did not consume soy foods, the adjusted live birth
rates per initiated cycle in increasing quartiles of cycle-specific urinary BPA concentrations were 54%,
35%, 31%, and 17% (P for trend � .03). The corresponding live birth rates among women reporting
pretreatment consumption of soy foods were 38%, 42%, 47%, and 49% (P for trend � 0.35). A similar
pattern was found for implantation (P for interaction � .02) and clinical pregnancy rates (P for inter-
action � .03) per initiated cycle, where urinary BPA was inversely related to these outcomes among
women not consuming soy foods but unrelated to them among soy consumers.
Conclusion: Soy food intake may protect against the adverse reproductive effects of BPA. As these
findings represent the first report suggesting a potential interaction between soy and BPA in humans,
they should be further evaluated in other populations. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 1082–1090, 2016)

 B
isphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume chem-
ical widely used in the manufacture of a variety of
consumer products (1). Exposure to BPA in the general
population is widespread with detectable urinary concen-
trations in more than 90% of individuals in a representa-
tive sample of US residents (2). Aglycone (unconjugated)
BPA has weak estrogenic activity through binding with
multipleestrogenreceptors(3–8)andisalsoaligandofthe
androgen receptor, the peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor �, and the thyroid hormone receptor (9). Fur-
thermore, the endocrine activity of BPA has been shown to
adversely affect fertility in animal models. Specifically, ex-
perimental data in rodents have shown that BPA hampers
ovarian follicle development and uterine receptivity
(10–17).
Experimental data also suggest that the adverse repro-
ductive effects of BPA can be modulated by specific dietary
factors. Although data in this area are still emerging, 2
independent groups have reported that the reproductive
effects of BPA in rodents are modified by the phytoestro-
gen content of diets. In mice fed a phytoestrogen-free diet,
there was a clear dose-response relationship between BPA
and congression failure (defined as the chromosomes’ fail-
ure to align on an otherwise normal meiotic spindle), with
abnormalities present in 2.0%, 3.5%, 3.6%, and 6.4% of
the oocytes at increasing doses of BPA, whereas BPA was
unrelated to oocyte abnormalities in the animals fed a
soy-based diet (18). In the Agouti mouse model, maternal
supplementation with phytoestrogens prevented BPA
from shifting the coat color distribution of their offspring
(19). We have recently reported little evidence of associ-
ations between urinary BPA concentrations and adverse
reproductive and pregnancy outcomes among women un-
dergoing infertility treatment with assisted reproductive
technologies (20). However, we also found that soy intake
was positively related to the probability of having a live
birth during infertility treatment with assisted reproduc-
tive technologies (21). Therefore, the objective of this ar-
ticle was to examine the hypothesis that soy intake mod-
ifies the association between BPA and fertility in women
undergoing assisted reproduction.
Subjects and Methods
Study population
Study participants were women enrolled in the EARTH
Study, an ongoing prospective cohort established in 2004 to
evaluate the role of environmental and nutritional determinants
of fertility (22). Women 18 to 45 years old were eligible to par-
ticipate, and approximately 60% of those contacted by the re-
search nurses enrolled. The current analysis includes 239 women
who completed at least 1 IVF cycle between 2007 and 2012 at the
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Fertility Center, had
provided at least 1 urine sample for the measurement of BPA per
IVF cycle, and had data on pretreatment soy food intake. The
study was approved by the Human Studies Institutional Review
Boards of the MGH, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public
Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). Participants signed an informed consent form after the
study procedures were explained by a research nurse, and all
questions were answered.
Clinical management and assessment of outcomes
Clinical information was abstracted from the patient’s elec-
tronic medical record by research nurses. Subsequent to an in-
fertilityevaluation,eachpatientwasgivenaninfertilitydiagnosis
by a physician at the MGH Fertility Center according to the
Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology definitions as de-
scribed previously (23). The participant’s date of birth was col-
lected at entry, and weight and height were measured by the
nurse. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in ki-
lograms) divided by height (in meters) squared.
Women underwent 1 of 3 controlled ovarian stimulation IVF
treatment protocols on day 3 of induced menses after completing
a cycle of oral contraceptives: (1) luteal phase GnRH-agonist
protocol, (2) follicular phase GnRH-agonist/flare protocol, or
(3) GnRH-antagonist protocol. The leuprolide dose was reduced
at, or shortly after, the start of ovarian stimulation with FSH/
human menopausal gonadotropin in the luteal phase GnRH-
agonist protocol. The FSH/human menopausal gonadotropin
and GnRH-agonist or GnRH-antagonist protocols were contin-
ued to the day of trigger with human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG). Throughout the monitoring phase of the subject’s IVF
treatment cycle, estradiol levels were obtained (Elecsys estradiol
II reagent kit; Roche Diagnostics). Oocyte retrieval was com-
pleted when at least 3 follicles reached a diameter of 16 to 18 mm
on transvaginal ultrasound, and the estradiol level reached at
least 800 pg/mL. Patients were monitored during gonadotropin
stimulation for serum estradiol, follicle size measurements and
counts, and endometrial thickness through 2 days before egg
retrieval. hCG was administered approximately 36 hours before
the scheduled egg retrieval procedure to induce ovulation.
Embryologists determined the total number of oocytes re-
trieved per cycle and classified them as germinal vesicle, meta-
phase I, metaphase II (mature), or degenerated. Oocytes under-
went either conventional IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm
injection as clinically indicated. Embryologists determined the
fertilization rate 17 to 20 hours after insemination as the number
of oocytes with 2 pronuclei divided by the number of mature
oocytes inseminated. The resulting embryos were assessed for
cell count and assigned a quality score, ranging from 1 (best) to
5 (worst) based on morphological characteristics. We classified
embryos as best quality if they had 4 cells on day 2, 8 cells on day
3, and a morphologic quality score of 1 or 2 on days 2 and 3. In
women who underwent an embryo transfer, clinical outcomes
were assessed. Implantation was defined as a serum �-hCG level
of �6 mIU/mL, typically measured 17 days (range 15–20 days)
after egg retrieval. An elevation in �-hCG with the confirmation
of an intrauterine pregnancy on an ultrasound at 6 weeks was
considered a clinical pregnancy. A live birth was defined as the
birth of a neonate on or after 24 weeks of gestation.

 Urine sample collection and BPA measurements
Women provided up to 2 spot urine samples per IVF cycle,
with the first one collected between day 3 and day 9 of the go-
nadotrophin phase and the second one collected on the day of
oocyte retrieval, before the procedure or administration of in-
travenous fluids. Urine was collected in a sterile, clean polypro-
pylene specimen cup. Specific gravity (SG), which was used to
correct BPA concentrations for urine dilution, was measured at
room temperature using a handheld refractometer (National In-
strument Company, Inc) calibrated with deionized water before
each measurement. Eighty percent of the cycles (278 of 347 cy-
cles) used 2 urine samples to characterize cycle-specific BPA lev-
els. The urine was divided into aliquots, frozen, and stored at
�80°C. Samples were shipped on dry ice overnight to the CDC
where they were stored at or below �40°C until analysis. The
urinary concentrations of the sum of free and conjugated BPA
species (total BPA) were measured using online solid-phase ex-
traction coupled with isotope dilution–HPLC-tandem mass
spectrometry,asdescribedbefore(24).First,100�Lofurinewas
treated with �-glucuronidase/sulfatase (Helix pomatia, H1;
Sigma-Aldrich) to hydrolyze the BPA-conjugated species. BPA
was then retained and concentrated on a C18 reversed-phase
size-exclusion solid-phase extraction column (Merck KGaA),
separated from other urine matrix components using a pair of
monolithic HPLC columns (Merck KGaA), and detected by neg-
ative ion–atmospheric pressure chemical ionization–tandem
massspectrometry.Thelimitofdetection(LOD)forBPAwas0.4
�g/L. In addition to study samples, each analytical run included
low-concentration and high-concentration quality control ma-
terials, prepared with spiked pooled human urine and reagent
blanks to assure the accuracy and reliability of the data (24). BPA
concentrations were corrected for urine dilution by SG using the
formula: Pc � P[(1.015 � 1)/SG � 1], where Pc is the SG-cor-
rected BPA concentration (micrograms per liter), P is the mea-
sured BPA concentration (micrograms per liter), and 1.015 is
the mean SG in the study population (25). The geometric mean
of the SG-adjusted BPA concentrations from 2 spot urine sam-
ples collected during each IVF cycle was used as a measure of
cycle-specific urinary BPA concentration. For cycles with only 1
urine sample (�20%), the BPA concentration for that single
urine sample was used as the cycle-specific urinary BPA concen-
tration. Samples with a BPA concentration below the LOD were
assigned a value equal to the LOD divided by the square root of
2 before adjustment for urine dilution by SG as described pre-
viously (26).
Dietary assessment
At enrollment, a brief, nurse-administered questionnaire
was used to collect data on demographics, medical history,
and lifestyle. Participants also completed a detailed take-
home questionnaire with additional questions on lifestyle fac-
tors, reproductive health, and medical history. Completion of
this questionnaire took, on average, 30 minutes. The ques-
tionnaire included a section querying the frequency of con-
sumption of 15 soy-based foods, a method previously found
to produce valid estimates of intake (27–30). Women were
asked to report how often, on average, they consumed each of
these 15 foods during the preceding 3 months and to describe
the usual serving size for each food in relation to a specified
“medium” serving size. The 15 food items included in this
questionnaire were tofu, tempeh, soy sausages, soy burgers, soy
packages,misosoup,soymilk,soyyogurt,tofucream,soybeans,
soy nuts, soy drinks, soy protein, and soy bars. There were 9
possible frequencies of intake ranging from never or less than
once per month to twice or more per day, and 3 possible usual
serving sizes: medium (the specified serving size), small (less than
specified), and large (more than specified). A more comprehen-
sive dietary assessment was later added to the study with the
introduction of a previously validated food frequency question-
naire (31), which asked participants to report how often, on
average, they consumed specified amounts of 131 food items
during the previous year. From this questionnaire we estimated
dietary pattern adherence scores (32).
Statistical analysis
Demographic and baseline reproductive characteristics of the
women are presented as medians � interquartile ranges (IQRs)
or percentages. Women were divided into quartiles of urinary
BPA concentrations (based on their cycle-specific geometric
meanoftheSG-adjustedBPAasdescribedabove)withthelowest
quartile considered the reference group. Associations between
urinary BPA concentrations and demographics and baseline re-
productive characteristics among women who consumed soy
and women who did not were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis
tests for continuous variables and �2 tests for categorical vari-
ables. Multivariable generalized linear mixed models were used
to evaluate the association between urinary BPA concentrations
and IVF outcomes among women who consumed soy and
women who did not, with a random intercept to account for
multiple IVF cycles in the same woman. A Poisson distribution
and log link function were specified for oocyte counts, a normal
distribution and identity link function were specified for endo-
metrial wall thickness and estradiol (E2) trigger levels, and a
binomial distribution and logit link function were specified for
embryo quality, fertilization rates, and clinical outcomes (im-
plantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth). To test whether
the relations between urinary BPA concentrations and IVF out-
comes were modified by diet, a product of quartiles of BPA and
a dichotomized soy variable (women who consumed soy vs who
did not) was entered into the model. Tests for linear trends (33)
were conducted using the median values of each quartile of uri-
nary BPA concentration as a continuous variable. To allow for
better interpretation of the results, population marginal means
(34) were presented accounting for all the covariates in the
model.
Confounding was assessed using prior knowledge on biolog-
ical relevance and descriptive statistics from our study popula-
tion. Specifically, we considered as potential confounders factors
related to BPA and IVF outcomes that were not potential inter-
mediates of this relation. These included factors previously re-
lated to IVF outcomes in this and other studies (35–39), as well
as factors associated with BPA exposure and IVF outcomes in
this study, regardless of whether they had been previously de-
scribed as predictors of IVF outcomes. Final models were ad-
justed for age (continuous), BMI (continuous), race (white vs
nonwhite), and infertility diagnosis (male, female, and unex-
plained).Sensitivityanalyseswereconductedtoevaluatethepos-
sibility of residual confounding. In these analyses, covariates
considered of clinical relevance were added to the multivariable
model even if they did not have the statistical properties of a
confounder (day 3 FSH, peak E2, and number of embryos trans-
ferred). We also restricted analyses to subpopulations of clinical

with SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
The study population comprised 239 women with a me-
dian age of 35.0 years (IQR, 32–38 years) and a median
BMI of 23.0 kg/m2 (IQR, 21.0–25.8 years), most of whom
(71%) had never smoked. Of the women, 176 (74%) con-
sumed soy foods. The mean isoflavone intake among soy
food consumers was 3.4 mg/d. The average number of
cycles per woman was 1.5 (range, 1–6 cycles); 168 (70%)
women underwent 1 treatment cycle, 44 (18%) under-
went 2 cycles, and 27 (11%) underwent �3 cycles. Uri-
nary BPA concentrations ranged from �0.4 �g/L (LOD)

 cantly related to urinary BPA concentrations among
women who consumed soy and who did not, respectively.
Soy food consumption modified the association be-
tween urinary BPA concentrations and clinical outcomes
of women undergoing infertility treatment with assisted
reproductive technologies (Figure 1). Women who did not
consume soy foods had lower rates of implantation, clin-
ical pregnancy, and live birth across increasing quartiles of
urinary BPA concentrations. On the other hand, urinary
BPA concentrations were unrelated to these outcomes
among women consuming soy foods
(Figure 1). This differences in dose-
response associations were statisti-
cally significant for implantation (P
for interaction � .02), clinical preg-
nancy (P for interaction � .03), and
live birth rates (P for interaction �
.01) per initiated treatment cycle.
Urinary BPA, however, was unre-
lated to intermediate outcomes (in-
cluding measures of oocyte yield,
oocyte quality, fertilization, and em-
bryo quality) among both sets of
women (Table 2).
We also conducted a series of
sensitivity analyses to address the
possibility of residual confound-
ing. Results remained unchanged
after adjustment for day 3 FSH lev-
els, peak E2 levels, and number of
embryos
transferred
and
when
analyses were restricted to cycles
with an embryo transfer (data not
shown). The same pattern was also
present in the subgroup of women
for whom a complete pretreatment
dietary assessment was conducted
with a validated food frequency
questionnaire (n � 192 women,
272 cycles). After additional ad-
justment for dietary patterns or in-
takes of folic acid and vitamin B12,
the magnitudes of dose-response
associations between BPA and im-
plantation remained similar, al-
though relations were not stati-
stically significant (Supplemental
Table 1).
Discussion
We evaluated whether the relation
between urinary concentrations of BPA with IVF out-
comes differed according to soy food intake in a pro-
spective cohort study of 239 women who underwent
347 IVF cycles. We found suggestive evidence that BPA
might relate to lower implantation, clinical pregnancy,
and live birth rates only among women who did not
consume soy foods but was unrelated to these outcomes
among women who consumed soy foods. This pattern
persisted in sensitivity analyses aimed to address po-
tential sources of unmeasured confounding including
Figure 1. Effect of the modification by soy intake of the relation between implantation (P for
interaction � .02), clinical pregnancy (P for interaction � .03), and live birth (P for interaction �
.01) and urinary BPA concentrations (micrograms per liter) (n � 347 fresh cycles). Implantation
(95% confidence interval) per initiated cycle across quartiles of urinary BPA concentrations
(represented by the medians for each quartile) by soy intake is presented. Models are adjusted
for age (continuous), BMI (continuous), race (white, black, Asian, and others), and infertility
diagnosis (male, female, and unexplained). Tests for trend were performed using the median
level of urinary BPA level in each quartile as a continuous variable in the model. Implantation was
defined as a serum �-hCG level of �6 mIU/mL typically measured 17 days (range, 15–20 days)
after egg retrieval, clinical pregnancy as the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by
ultrasound, and live birth as the birth of a neonate on or after 24 weeks of gestation. *, P � .05

 intake of nutrients previously related to live birth rates
in this cohort (35). We did not find any evidence, how-
ever, for an interaction between BPA and markers of
ovarian response, oocyte quality, embryo quality, or
fertilization rate.
The findings in the current analysis suggesting that soy
intake modifies the relation between BPA and infertility
treatment outcomes probably explain why we failed to
find an association between urinary BPA concentrations
and outcomes of women undergoing infertility treatment
inourrecentpublication(20).Specifically,weobservedno
overall effect of BPA on a wide range of intermediate and
clinical treatment endpoints, ranging from markers of
oocyte and embryo quality to live birth rates. However, as
our current analysis shows, there were significant associ-
ations between urinary BPA concentrations and preg-
nancy outcomes among women who do not consume soy
products. It is also possible that the lack of association
between BPA and couple fecundity observed in the Lon-
gitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment
(LIFE) Study (40) could also be the result of a strong un-
derlying interaction with soy intake as was the case in our
study.OurresultshavepotentialimplicationsbeyondBPA
and soy. That is, when we explore the effects of environ-
mental chemicals, it is important to consider modifiers
such as diet, stress, or other factors.
Our findings are in agreement with experimental data
in rodents showing a protective effect of soy on the adverse
reproductive effects of BPA (18, 19). Muhlhauser et al (18)
demonstrated that the effects of BPA on the growing
oocyte are modulated by phytoestrogens in the diet. They
performed an experiment in which female rodents treated
with increasing doses of BPA were fed either a casein-
based diet or a soy-based diet. Among mice fed the casein-
based diet, there was a linear dose-response relationship
between BPA and the frequency of spindle/chromosome
alignment abnormalities. Among mice fed the soy-based
diet, however, there was not a clear relation between BPA
and congression failure. In a separate experimental model,
Dolinoy et al (19) found that maternal supplementation
with genistein, a phytoestrogen primarily found in soy,
restored the coat color distribution in BPA-exposed off-
spring. Specifically, Agouti females exposed to BPA were
assigned to receive either a phytoestrogen-free or a
genistein-supplemented diet. Of the offspring of mice not
supplemented with genistein, 21% had a yellow coat,
whereas the frequency of yellow coat offspring among
genistein-supplemented mice was 10%.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that an inter-
action between BPA and soy has been suggested in hu-
mans. Although the consistency of our findings with those
of previous experiments in rodents suggests that they may
represent a true biological interaction, it is not possible to
discern the underlying biological mechanism for interac-
tion from our data. Work in rodents suggests that the
effects on DNA methylation may be one of the mecha-
nisms underlying this interaction. In the Agouti mouse
model, maternal exposure to BPA results in decreased
methylation at the CabpIAP metastable epiallele in BPA-
exposed offspring, indicating that BPA-induced DNA hy-
pomethylation is not locus dependent (19). In contrast,
dietary exposure to genistein induces gene hypermethyl-
ation (41) and reverses BPA-induced DNA hypomethyla-
tion (19). Genistein inhibits tyrosine kinase (42), scav-
enges free radicals (43), and, like BPA, exhibits mixed
estrogenicandantiestrogenicproperties(44)dependingon
timing, dose, and tissue. Whether these or other, yet to be
described, biological mechanisms underlie the observed in-
teraction is not known, highlighting the need for additional
study of potential interactions between diet and BPA.
The present study has some limitations. First, because
all study participants were women undergoing infertility

Data are presented as rates (95% CI) adjusted for age (continuous), BMI (continuous), races (white, black, Asian, and others), and infertility
diagnosis (male, female, and unexplained). A total of 100 fresh cycles were carried out among women who did not consume soy and 247 fresh
cycles among women who consumed soy.
a We classified embryos as best quality if they had 4 cells on day 2, 8 cells on day 3, and a morphologic quality score of 1 or 2 on days 2 and 3.
b Tests for trend were performed using the median level of urinary BPA level in each group as a continuous variable in the model.

 treatment with assisted reproduction, it is not possible to
know whether our findings are generalizable to women
trying to become pregnant without medical interventions.
However, women in this study are comparable to women
attending fertility clinics in the United States (45), sug-
gesting that these findings may be applicable to other
women seeking infertility treatment. Second, as is the case
for all studies based on diet questionnaires, measurement
error and misclassification of intake are of concern. Nev-
ertheless, similar questionnaires have been found to cor-
relate well with biological markers of intake (27–30).
Moreover, because soy food intake was assessed before
the initiation of infertility treatment, it is unlikely that the
error was related to treatment outcome. Therefore, the
expected effect of this type of error is that the association
between soy intake and treatment outcomes is actually
stronger than that observed in this study. Third, although
we included 347 urine samples in this analysis, some of the
BPA quartiles, particularly among the 61 women who did
not consume soy, have relatively small size. Misclassifica-
tion of BPA exposure based on a spot urine sample is
possible because BPA is a short-lived chemical, and expo-
sures are probably episodic in nature, which might atten-
uate associations. Last, some legumes as well as bakery
products made with soy protein–enriched flour contain
small amounts of phytoestrogens, specifically of isofla-
vones (46). Nevertheless, soy and soy products are the
primary sources of exposure to isoflavones in Western
populations (47–50). In fact, among contemporary
women in the United States, soy foods account for �90%
of total isoflavone intake and among women in the Boston
area, where the study was conducted, they account for
nearly 97% of intake (49). As a result, the effect of failing
to account for nonsoy sources of isoflavones is probably
negligible. The strengths of our study include its prospec-
tive design and complete follow-up of participants, which
minimizes the risk of reverse causation, and the compre-
hensive adjustment of possible confounding variables is
made possible by standardized assessment of a wide range
of participant characteristics. In addition, the similarity in
the distribution of urinary BPA concentrations (51) and of
isoflavone intake (27) between women in this study and
womeninthegeneralpopulationsuggeststhatthefindings
may be generalizable.
In summary, we found that soy food intake may be
protective against the adverse reproductive effects of BPA.
These findings are in agreement with data from 2 inde-
pendent experimental models in rodents. However, they
represent the first report of a possible interaction between
soy and BPA in humans, and as such it is important that
these findings be further evaluated in other populations.
Moreover, these results highlight the need to study how
diet and other lifestyle factors amenable to change may
modify the potentially deleterious health effects of BPA in
particular and of environmental chemicals in general.
