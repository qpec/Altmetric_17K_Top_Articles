Background
More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are diagnosed each year worldwide and the incidence
is rising, partly as a result of human papillomavirus. Human papillomavirus-associated OPSCC affects younger patients and often
presents at a higher stage; however, it is associated with a better prognosis.
Until recently, first-line management of OPSCC involved chemoradiotherapy, as research had demonstrated comparable survival
outcomes when compared with open surgery, with significantly decreased morbidity. However, interventions have now evolved with
computerised planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and the advent of endoscopic head and neck surgery, which provide the
potential for decreased treatment-associated morbidity.
The oropharynx plays an essential role in swallowing, speech and protecting the airway as it is situated at the bifurcation of the respiratory
and digestive tracts. Treatment modality recommendations are based on survival outcomes. Given the younger patient demographic,
establishing the safety of modalities that potentially have better functional outcome is becoming increasingly important.
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of endoscopic head and neck surgery (transoral robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for small-volume,
primary (T1-2, N0-2) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in comparison to radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy.
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL
2016, Issue 10); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and
unpublished trials. The date of the search was 8 November 2016.

 Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials in patients with carcinoma in the oropharynx subsite (as defined by the World Health Organization
classification C09, C10). Cancers included were primary squamous cell carcinomas arising from the oropharyngeal mucosa. The
tumours were classified as T1-T2 with or without nodal disease and with no evidence of distant metastatic spread. The intervention
was transoral, minimally invasive surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The comparator was
primary radiotherapy with or without induction or concurrent chemotherapy for the tumour. The treatments received and compared
were of curative intent and patients had not undergone prior intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy.
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (disease-related
mortality was to be studied where possible), locoregional control, disease-free survival and progression-free survival or time to recurrence.
All outcomes were to be measured at two, three and five years after diagnosis. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, harms
associated with treatment, patient satisfaction and xerostomia score.
Main results
No completed studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Two ongoing trials fulfilled the selection criteria, however neither are
complete.
’Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: radiotherapy versus trans-oral robotic surgery (ORATOR)’ is a phase II
randomised controlled trial comparing primary radiation therapy with primary transoral robotic surgery for small-volume primary
(T1-2, N0-2) OPSCC. It is currently in progress with an estimated completion date of June 2021.
’European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 1420 (EORTC 1420-HNCG-ROG)’ is a phase III, randomised study
assessing the “best of” radiotherapy compared to transoral robotic surgery/transoral laser microsurgery in patients with T1-T2, N0
squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and base of tongue. It was due to start accrual mid-2016.
Authors’ conclusions
The role of endoscopic head and neck surgery in the management of OPSCC is clearly expanding as evidenced by its more overt
incorporation into the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Data are mounting regarding its outcomes both
in terms of survival and lower morbidity. As confidence increases, it is being used in the management of more advanced OPSCC.
Based on this review, there is currently no high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding clinical outcomes for
patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving endoscopic head and neck surgery compared with primary chemoradiotherapy.

Minimally invasive (keyhole) surgery versus radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy and chemotherapy for early-stage throat cancer
Review question
We reviewed the evidence to compare two treatments for throat cancer. The treatments were keyhole surgery and radiotherapy alone
or combined with chemotherapy.
Background
More than 400,000 cases of cancer of the middle part of the throat (oropharynx) are diagnosed each year worldwide and this number
is rising, with human papillomavirus (HPV) being a significant contributing factor. Throat cancer caused by this virus affects younger
patients and they often present with more advanced disease. However, it is associated with a better prognosis.
Until recently the first-line management of this type of throat cancer involved radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy, as research
had demonstrated similar survival rates when compared with surgery but with significantly fewer side effects. However, treatments have
now evolved with computerised planning and improvements in radiotherapy, and the advent of keyhole head and neck surgery, which
have the potential for fewer side effects from treatment.
The oropharynx plays an essential role in swallowing, speech and protecting the airway as it is situated at the junction of the respiratory
and digestive tracts. The choice of which treatment to use is based on which is associated with the best survival. As younger patients

 are being affected, establishing the safety of treatments with potentially fewer side effects and less disability is becoming increasingly
important.
Search date
The evidence is current to November 2016.
Study characteristics
We found no completed studies that compared keyhole surgery and radiotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy. Two ongoing
trials did fulfil our selection criteria, however neither are yet complete. One has an estimated completion date of June 2021 and the
other planned to start recruiting patients mid-2016.
Key results
There are not yet any completed studies to include in the review so there are no results.
Quality of the evidence and conclusions
The role of keyhole surgery in the management of throat cancer is expanding as is demonstrated by its incorporation into the current
national guidelines in the USA. Evidence is mounting regarding its outcomes both in terms of survival and fewer side effects.
Based on this review, there is currently no high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials that compare keyhole surgery with
radiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with throat cancer.

Description of the condition
More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carci-
noma (OPSCC) are diagnosed each year worldwide (Chaturvedi
2013). It is estimated that there will be approximately 48,000 new
cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer in the United States in 2016
(Siegel 2016). Worldwide the incidence of OPSCC ranges from
7 to 17 cases per 100,000 persons (Chaturvedi 2013), and in de-
veloped countries it is steadily rising, particularly in young males
(Chaturvedi 2011).
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major carcinogen, with an esti-
mated 4.8% of total worldwide cancers in 2008 linked to the virus
(de Martel 2012). HPV now meets the epidemiological criteria
for OPSCC causality, especially in non-smokers (Gillison 2015;
Sudhoff 2011). Meta-analysis of the world literature has demon-
strated that the proportion of HPV-associated oropharyngeal can-
cer has increased from 40.5% in studies recruiting before the year
2000 to 72.2% in studies reporting after 2005 (Mehanna 2012).
However, this is known to vary by individual population (Schache
2016). In contrast to this apparent overall trend, Schache et al have
published recent work to show that over the period 2002 to 2011,
whilstthe overall incidence of OPSCCinthe UK doubled,the pro-
portion that were HPV-positive stayed the same, demonstrating
an increase in non-HPV associated OPSCC (Schache 2016). In
the UK population, therefore, the increase cannot be attributed to
HPV alone. It is worth noting that this group of HPV-positive pa-
tients has significantly improved rates of both overall and disease-
free survival compared to HPV-negative tumour groups. HPV-
positive OPSCC displays a 58% reduction in the risk of death
compared to HPV-negative disease (Ang 2010; Fakhry 2008). In-
deed the presence or absence of HPV with regard to the tumour
may have a greater impact on five-year survival than T stage or
nodal status alone (Haughey 2011).
Risk factors for oral HPV infection include a history of orogenital
sexual practice, a large number of sexual partners and first inter-
course at an early age. The same factors also reflect changes in
modern society and combine to increase the cumulative effect of
HPV infection in OPSCC (Chung 2009). HPV-negative OPSCC
tends to affect an older age group and is normally associated with
smoking and alcohol. HPV-positive OPSCC behaves differently,
often presenting with a small primary in the oropharynx com-
bined with a metastatic cystic deposit in the neck, thereby entail-
ing a higher stage at presentation for the majority of patients (Ang
2010; Dwivedi 2013; Evans 2010).
Description of the intervention
Over the last 20 years management of oropharyngeal cancer has
changed dramatically. In 2002, Parsons et al published a review of
51 studies of patients with OPSCC who were treated with surgery
with or without radiation therapy or primary radiation therapy
without neck dissection (Parsons 2002). The cumulative five-year
survival was 47% for patients undergoing primary surgical resec-
tion with or without neck dissection, and 43% for those under-
going primary radiation therapy with or without neck dissection.
However, the severe complication rate was 23% in the primary sur-
gical group and only 6% in the primary radiation group. This led
to the conclusion that non-operative therapy was superior to oper-
ative therapy for OPSCC of all stages. More recently a large meta-
analysis comparing primary radiotherapy with chemoradiother-
apy in 16,192 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
patients provided updated results. The study concluded an abso-
lute survival benefit of 8.1% after five years in OPSCC patients
treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (Blanchard 2011).
As the biological differences in viral/non-viral associated OP-
SCC are further elaborated (Masterson 2015; Pyeon 2007; Slebos
2006), radical change in most therapeutic interventions has taken
place. With regard to radiotherapy, intensity modulation and com-
puterised planning have been introduced in addition to external
beam therapy. In surgery, the focus has shifted to the use of min-
imally invasive procedures such as transoral laser microsurgery
or transoral robotic surgery, which demonstrate reduced imme-
diate postoperative toxicity, reduced length of hospital stay and
faster functional recovery compared with open surgery (Holsinger
2015). Furthermore, these techniques have the potential to im-
prove organ preservation and function, and ameliorate the eco-
nomic burden of treatment. Additionally, with regard to control
of lymphatic spread, neck dissections have become more selective
(resulting in the removal of fewer normal structures and therefore
lower morbidity) (Adelstein 2012).
Current management, following the US National Comprehen-
sive Cancer Network guidelines for T1-2, N0-1 oropharyngeal
tumours (NCCN 2015), is either definitive radiotherapy (with or
without salvage surgery) or primary surgery (transoral or open,
with or without ipsilateral or bilateral neck dissection). Post-
surgery, if there is extracapsular spread or a positive margin
not amenable to re-resection, the patient should have adjuvant
chemoradiotherapy. If there are other adverse features (pT3-4 pri-
mary, N2-3 nodal disease, nodal disease in levels IV or V, perineu-
ral invasion or vascular embolism) patients should at least have
radiotherapy with consideration of chemoradiotherapy. For T2 le-
sions the current guidance is for patients to receive induction che-
motherapy prior to radiotherapy or to receive chemoradiotherapy,
each with the possibility of salvage surgery for residual disease.
The extent of neck dissection depends on the staging. In the case
of N0 lesions a selective neck dissection of at least levels II-IV is
recommended. In N1-N2a-c cases a selective to comprehensive
neck dissection is recommended. The NCCN guidelines state that
“In general, patients undergoing selective neck dissection should
not have clinical nodal disease; however, selective neck dissection
may prevent morbidity in patients with nodal disease and may
6

 be appropriate in certain patients with N1-N2 disease” (NCCN
2015).
Transoral endoscopic head and neck surgery poses several chal-
lenges in relation to haemostasis, illumination and tissue manip-
ulation. In particular, transoral laser surgery is limited by a ’line
of sight’ where the lens of the microscope, used for visualisa-
tion, is distant from the patient. The CO2 laser is also not ide-
ally suited to haemostasis, sometimes requiring alternation of the
laser with diathermy or surgical clips. The long manipulators can
further restrict the surgeon. Piecemeal removal may be required
to facilitate the minimally invasive approach, which goes against
the traditional tenets of en-bloc removal to preserve the speci-
men for the histopathologist and in order to prevent seeding of
the tumour. However, data published by several units have pro-
vided evidence that challenges this latter point (Christiansen 2006;
Haughey 2011).
Robotic surgery has now emerged to overcome some of the limi-
tations of laser surgery and further expand the minimally invasive
surgery portfolio. The advantages offered to the surgeon include a
three-dimensional view, 360° robotic arm movement (in restricted
spaces with precision of movement), hand tremor filtration and
lack of muscle fatigue. Line of sight restrictions can be avoided
as optical feedback from the endoscope is near the resection tis-
sue and angled instruments can be used (Genden 2012). Further-
more, combinations of the two techniques have been developed
including carbon dioxide and thulium laser attachments for the
Da Vinci robot (Solares 2007; Van Abel 2012).
How the intervention might work
In the 1980s, Wolfgang Steiner pioneered the transoral use of
lasers to resect tumours of the upper aerodigestive tract (Steiner
1988). Subsequent publications have confirmed that survival us-
ing these transoral laser techniques is at least as good as with
primary radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy, whilst long-term swal-
lowing function is significantly enhanced (Haughey 2011; Rich
2011).
The published literature suggests that survival outcomes are sim-
ilar for OPSCC treated by either transoral laser microsurgery or
lip split mandibulotomy (Jackel 2007). One recent clinical trial
comparing both modalities had too few patients in each group to
make a valid comparison with respect to survival, but suggested a
benefit of transoral laser microsurgery for other parameters such as
tracheostomy rate, time to decannulation, mode of feeding, length
of hospital stay and cost (Williams 2013).
Most tertiary head and neck ENT departments will already possess
or have access to a CO2 laser, given its use in the larynx, and its
limitations are well recognised. However, the expertise required
for its use in resection of OPSCC is less widespread. Nevertheless,
given the possibilities in terms of patient outcomes, its use can
only increase (Grant 2009).
In recent years, additional evidence of enhanced functional out-
come following transoral tumour resection has been provided by
the early proponents of transoral robotic surgery (Lawson 2011;
Moore 2009; Weinstein 2012). The da Vinci Surgical Robot (In-
tuitive Surgical Incorporated, CA, USA) has been utilised for al-
most all surgical procedures performed in the head and neck region
(Weinstein 2012). The system comprises three components: (a) a
high-definition visual display unit, (b) a surgical control platform
that is distant from the patient, and (c) a robotic platform adjacent
to the patient. The surgeon can remotely operate the robot using
EndoWrist technology, which offers several advantages in terms
of tremor filtration, three-dimensional visualisation and wristed
instrumentation. The surgical platform allows control of robot
manipulators that normally consist of a camera arm (providing
true stereoscopic, high-definition images) and two 8 mm or 5 mm
handling arms.
Lack of haptic feedback, extra space and time allocation are com-
mon limitations that are likely to improve in the near future with
advancing technology. The cost of installation is approximately
GBP 1 million (USD 1.2 million) along with a GBP 70,000 to
80,000 (USD 87,000 to 99,000) yearly maintenance fee and GBP
150 to 500 (USD 186 to 620) per case due to disposable instru-
mentation (Weinstein 2007). Whilst this high price restricts ac-
quisition to larger teaching hospital settings where the capital out-
lay cost can be shared with urology, general surgery and cardio-
thoracic departments (who will also have higher case-loads), the
disposable instrument costs are comparable with other endoscopic
harmonic or laser instruments (Richmon 2014).
Why it is important to do this review
The oropharynx plays an essential role in swallowing, speech and
protecting the airway as it is situated at the bifurcation of the
respiratory and digestive tract. Treatment modalities are heavily
influenced by the aim of reducing the risk of functional disability
where possible.
Early-stage tumours arising from the tonsil or base of the tongue
region (T1 or T2) can be a technical challenge to excise and may
necessitate a trans-cervical or mandibulotomy approach. Radio-
therapy or chemoradiotherapy are alternative primary treatments
and will often be given as adjuvant treatment if complete surgi-
cal clearance cannot be obtained. Open surgery and radiotherapy/
chemoradiotherapy both have drawbacks in terms of cost, over-
all survival and patient quality of life (Haigentz 2009; Machtay
2008). This latter point has become more important because
HPV-associated OPSCC affects a younger patient cohort who
may have to carry the burden of treatment-related morbidity for
a much longer period of time (Quon 2013).
Advanced technology has now made it possible to completely re-
sect a primary oropharyngeal tumour using transoral, minimal ac-
cess surgery. Lasers can be used to resect tumours under micro-
scopic guidance and three-dimensional images of the back of the

 mouth enable robotically guided instruments to dissect tumours
free from surrounding tissues. So far, observational studies suggest
that these approaches may have an advantage by improving pa-
tient quality of life and functional outcome, and reducing the need
for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Leonhardt 2012; Moore 2013).
Furthermore, the use of endoscopic head and neck surgery for the
primary site may permit a lower radiation dose to the neck (60 Gy
rather than 70 Gy), with a concomitant reduction in radiation-
related morbidity. This has raised the potential option of ’de-es-
calation therapy’ in the case of HPV-related OPSCC (Masterson
2014a; Masterson 2014b; Moore 2009). The potential benefits of
this are apparent when one considers the well-established relation-
ship between the radiation dose to the constrictor muscles and
long-term swallowing difficulties: patients in whom more than
78% of their cricopharyngeus inlet receives over 60 Gy have a
50% risk of developing a stricture (Chen 2010).
The potential benefits of a minimally invasive approach were be-
hind the drive to investigate the evidence comparing this with tra-
ditional radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy. We plan to review the
evidence for de-escalation of adjuvant treatment post minimally
invasive surgery in a related review of ’Trans-oral endoscopic head
and neck surgery plus adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy versus trans-
oral endoscopic head and neck surgery plus de-intensified adju-
vant (chemo)radiotherapy for oropharyngeal squamous cell carci-
noma’ (title registered with Cochrane).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials. We excluded quasi-randomised and
cluster-randomised trials.
Types of participants
We included patients with carcinoma in the oropharynx subsite
(as defined by the World Health Organization classification C09,
C10). We excluded oral cavity (C01-C02, C03, C04, C05-C06),
hypopharynx (C13), nasopharynx (C11) and larynx (C32) lesions
(WHO 2000).
Cancers included were primary squamous cell carcinomas arising
from the oropharyngeal mucosa. The tumours were classified as
T1-T2 with or without nodal disease and with no evidence of dis-
tant metastatic spread. A significant proportion of patients are ex-
pected to be HPV16-positiveve (the commonest subtype of HPV
responsible for more than 95% of cases of oropharyngeal squa-
mous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)).
Types of interventions
Intervention
Transoral, minimally invasive surgery (transoral robotic surgery/
transoral laser microsurgery) with or without adjuvant radiother-
apy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
Control
Primary radiotherapy with or without induction or concurrent
chemotherapy for the tumour. The treatments received and com-
pared were of curative intent and patients had not undergone prior
intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy.
The sole planned comparison was:
• endoscopic head and neck surgery versus radiotherapy/
chemoradiotherapy.
Types of outcome measures
We planned to analyse the following outcomes in the review, but
they would not have been used as a basis for including or excluding
studies.
Primary outcomes
• Overall survival (disease-related mortality was to be studied
where possible)
• Locoregional control
• Disease-free survival
• Progression-free survival or time to recurrence
All outcomes were to be measured at two, three and five years after
diagnosis.
Secondary outcomes
• Quality of life, dysphagia and patient satisfaction, including
the following:
◦ MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI)
◦ Gastrostomy tube rate (at one year)
◦ European Organisation for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC) scales (e.g. QLQ-C30 and H&N35)
◦ Neck Dissection Impairment Index (NDII)

Search methods for identification of studies
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist conducted systematic
searches for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical
trials. There were no language, publication year or publication
status restrictions. The date of the search was 8 November 2016.

The Information Specialist modelled the subject strategies for
databases on the search strategy designed for CENTRAL. Where
appropriate, they were combined with subject strategy adaptations
of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by Cochrane for
identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical tri-
als (as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions Version 5.1.0, Box 6.4.b. (Handbook 2011). Search
strategies for major databases including CENTRAL are provided
in Appendix 1.
Searching other resources
We scanned the reference lists of identified publications for ad-
ditional trials and contacted trial authors where necessary. In ad-
dition, the Information Specialist searched PubMed, theCochrane
Library and Google to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant
to this systematic review, so that we could scan their reference lists
for additional trials.
Data collection and analysis
This review is based on a published protocol (Howard 2014).
Selection of studies
Three authors (JH, LM and RD) independently screened the re-
sults of the search to identify studies that broadly met the inclu-
sion criteria. We independently assessed studies selected for full-
text review against the predefined inclusion criteria. Any conflict
was resolved by referral to a senior author.
Data extraction and management
Three review authors (JH, LM and RD) independently extracted
data using a specially designed data extraction form. We piloted
the data extraction forms on several papers and modified them as
required before use. We discussed any disagreements in full and
consulted a senior review author where necessary. Where required,
we contacted the authors for clarification or missing information.
For each trial we recorded the following data.
• Year of publication, country of origin and source of study
funding.
• Details of the participants, including demographic
characteristics and criteria for inclusion and exclusion.
• Details of the type of intervention, timing and duration.
• Details of quality of life after treatment (EORTC QLQ-
HN35 or equivalent questionnaire) (Singer 2013).
• Details of treatment-related morbidity, categorised as acute
(less than 90 days after treatment) or late (more than 90 days)
and classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE 2010).
• Details of all other outcomes reported, including method of
assessment and time intervals.
• HPV status for each patient established by displaying p16
activity (a surrogate marker of viral activity) utilising
immunohistochemistry and, if positive, confirmed by
polymerase chain reaction or DNA/RNA in situ hybridisation
(Masterson 2016; Schache 2011; Westra 2009).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Had suitable trials been retrieved JH, LM and RD would have
assessed the risk of bias of the included trials independently, with
9

 the following taken into consideration, as guided by theCochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook
2011):
• sequence generation;
• allocation concealment;
• blinding;
• incomplete outcome data;
• selective outcome reporting; and
• other sources of bias.
We planned to use the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool in RevMan 5.3
(RevMan 2014), which involves describing each of these domains
as reported in the trial and then assigning a judgement about the
adequacy of each entry: ’low’, ’high’ or ’unclear’ risk of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
We planned to express continuous outcomes as a mean difference
with standard deviation. For continuous outcomes measured using
different (but compatible) scales we planned to express treatment
effects as a standardised mean difference.
For the key outcomes in the ’Summary of findings’ table we also
planned to present the results as absolute percentages.
Unit of analysis issues
We planned to use data only from individually randomised con-
trolled trials to avoid unit of analysis issues. We planned to exclude
cluster-randomised trials.
Dealing with missing data
We planned to contact study authors:
• where a study protocol suggested an outcome of interest
had been measured but was not reported;
• if not all data required for meta-analysis were reported;
• if standard deviation data were not available or estimable
from other reported data (using the methods detailed in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Handbook 2011)).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We planned to assess heterogeneity by inspecting the overlap of
confidence intervals for the results of individual studies and to
utilise horizontal lines to depict these graphically. We planned to
conduct formal assessment of heterogeneity using the Chi² test
(with a significance level of α = 0.1 in view of the low power
of this test) and the I² statistic (with 75% or more indicating a
considerable level of inconsistency), both available in RevMan 5.3
(RevMan 2014).
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned to assess reporting bias as within-study (outcome re-
porting) bias and between-study (publication) bias.
Outcome reporting bias
Bias can occur if outcomes are not adequately reported to allow
further analysis. We planned to assess outcome reporting bias by
comparing the reported outcomes against the outcomes listed in
the trial protocol or methods section. Where there was insufficient
detail we planned to contact study authors. If no further informa-
tion could be found this would be judged a ’high’ risk of bias. If
insufficient information was found to allow adequate judgement
we would judge this an ’unclear’ risk of bias.
Publication bias
If sufficient trials were available we planned to assess funnel plots
for each outcome. If asymmetry was found we planned to inves-
tigate this further according to the methodology in the Cochrane
Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2011).
Data synthesis
We planned to extract data from the included studies and enter
the data into RevMan 5.3 for statistical analysis. In the event of
incomplete data, we intended to contact the study authors to ob-
tain further information and to seek statistical advice where nec-
essary. We planned to approach survival and disease recurrence in
one of two ways depending on the data available and aimed to
include analysis of the proportion surviving at two, three and five
years as dichotomous outcomes or hazard ratios for comparison in
meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes were to be restricted to assess-
ment of validated questionnaires (where appropriate). If the data
provided were in the form of means and standard deviations, we
intended to display the effects on outcomes as standardised mean
differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and us-
ing an intention-to-treat analysis. If hazard ratios were not quoted
in studies, we planned to calculate them from available summary
statistics such as observed events, expected events, variance, con-
fidence intervals, P values or survival curves (Parmar 1998).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We intendedtoassessclinical heterogeneitybyexaminingthe types
of participants, interventions and outcomes in each study. We
would have attempted a meta-analysis if studies were available with
similar comparisons and reported the same outcome measures.
If appropriate, we intended to calculate pooled estimates using a
random-effects model (Handbook 2011), as there is likely to be
significant statistical or clinical heterogeneity (an I² value > 50%,
as specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions).

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 If the data provided were in the form of means and standard de-
viations, we intended to display the effects on outcomes as stan-
dardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs and using an in-
tention-to-treat analysis.
Furthermore, if the subgroups showed a clinically relevant dif-
ference we planned to report them separately using a fixed-effect
model (Handbook 2011).
Sensitivity analysis
We aimed to consider a sensitivity analysis to compare fixed-ef-
fect and random-effects estimates. We also planned to undertake
a sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of allocation conceal-
ment, randomisation, quality of follow-up and blind outcome as-
sessment (if appropriate).
GRADE and ’Summary of findings’ table
We planned to use the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality
of evidence. The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we
are confident that an estimate of effect is correct and we planned to
apply this in the interpretation of results. There are four possible
ratings: high, moderate, low and very low. A rating of high quality
of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect
and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence
in the estimate of effect. A rating of very low quality implies that
any estimate of effect obtained is very uncertain.
The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs that do not have
serious limitations as high quality. However, several factors can
lead to the downgrading of the evidence to moderate, low or very
low. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness
of these factors:
• study limitations (risk of bias);
• inconsistency;
• indirectness of evidence;
• imprecision; and
• publication bias.
We planned to include a ’Summary of findings’ table, constructed
according to the recommendations described in Chapter 10 of
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Handbook 2011), which would include the following outcomes:
1) overall survival; 2) locoregional control; 3) progression-free sur-
vival; 4) gastrostomy rate (at one year); 5) tracheostomy rate; 6)
swallowing function (MDADI); 7) quality of life (EORTC QLQ-
C30 and H&N35).

 No completed studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. We
excluded three studies, ADEPT, ECOG-E3311 and PATHOS,
and identified two ongoing studies that will meet our inclusion cri-
teria when they are complete (EORTC 1420; ORATOR). There
are no studies awaiting assessment.
Included studies
There are no included studies.
Excluded studies
We excluded three studies after full-text review (see the table of
Characteristics of excluded studies for individual study details).
ADEPT is a phase III, prospective trial of de-escalated adju-
vant treatment post endoscopic head and neck surgery (transoral
robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for human papillo-
mavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC) (T1-4a) patients noted to have extracapsular spread de-
tected in the nodal disease. The study is currently in progress with
an estimated completion date of October 2021. Patients are allo-
cated to two arms post endoscopic head and neck surgery through
randomisation or patient choice, to receive either postoperative
radiotherapy (60 Gy) alone or with concurrent systemic cisplatin
therapy.
The primary outcomes are disease-free survival and locoregional
control at two years. Secondary outcomes include overall survival
and distant metastasis rate up to five years, quality of life and
functional outcomes to two years, and toxicities up to 4.5 months.
We excluded this study because it includes advanced tumours (T1-
4a) and all patients have nodal neck disease with extracapsular
spread. Again all patients receive the surgical intervention so there
is no radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy-alone cohort.
ECOG-E3311 is a phase II, prospective randomised trial of re-
duced adjuvant treatment post transoral robotic surgery for HPV-
positive locally advanced OPSCC (stages III-IVa + IVb without
distant metastases). The study is in progress with an estimated
completion date of October 2016. The primary foci for inves-
tigation are the feasibility of risk-adjusted adjuvant therapy and
oncologic outcomes for intermediate-risk patients post transoral
robotic surgery and standard or de-escalated treatment.
Patients will be stratified into three groups depending on their
surgical histology. The low-risk group will have no adjuvant ther-
apy as per standard treatment. The medium-risk group will be
randomised to receive either standard (60 Gy) or de-escalated (50
Gy) postoperative radiotherapy. The high-risk group will receive
postoperative radiotherapy (60 Gy) with concurrent cisplatin.
The primary outcomes include progression-free survival at two
years, risk distribution and grade 3-4 bleeding events during
surgery. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, swallow and
voice function up to two years post-treatment, and change in pa-
tient-reported quality of life up to six months post-radiation treat-
ment.
We excluded this study because it includes advanced tumours (T3-
4)onlyandagainbecause all patientsreceive asurgical intervention
so there is no radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy-alone cohort.
PATHOS is a phase II/III, prospective randomised controlled trial
of reduced-intensity adjuvant treatment for HPV-positive OP-
SCC(T1-3,N0-2b)patientstreatedwith transoral roboticsurgery.
It is not yet open for recruitment and the estimated completion is
December 2019.
Patients will be stratified into three groups depending on their
surgical histology. The low-risk group will have no adjuvant ther-
apy as per standard treatment. The medium-risk group will be
randomised to receive either standard (60 Gy) or de-escalated (50
Gy) postoperative radiotherapy. The high-risk group will be ran-
domised to receive postoperative radiotherapy (60 Gy) with or
without concurrent cisplatin.
The primary outcome measure is swallowing function (MD An-
derson Dysphagia Inventory) at one year. Secondary outcomes in-
clude disease-free and overall survival at six months, and swallow-
ing function, quality of life and acute or late toxicities measured
at up to 24 months.
We excluded this study because it includes patients with T1-3,
N0-2b disease and all patients receive endoscopic head and neck
surgery. There is therefore no radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy-
alone cohort. Randomisation is also performed only after stratifi-
cation by stage/features of the excised tumour.
All three of these studies are potentially of interest for our related
review on de-escalation of adjuvant therapy (title registered with
Cochrane).
Ongoing studies
Two studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, however
neither are completed. One is in preparation and the other in
progress with initial results expected in 2021.
’Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: Radio-
therapy versus Trans-oral Robotic Surgery’ (ORATOR) is a phase
II, randomised controlled trial comparing primary radiotherapy
with primary transoral robotic surgery for early-stage (T1-2, N0-
2) OPSCC. It is currently in progress with an estimated com-
pletion date of June 2021. Patients will be randomised to receive
either primary radiotherapy or primary transoral robotic surgery
with or without neck dissection. The primary outcome is quality
of life (at one year) and the secondary outcomes include overall
and progression-free survival (at three and five years), toxicity and
swallowing function (at five years).
’European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer
1420 (EORTC 1420-HNCG-ROG)’ is a phase III, randomised
13

 study assessing the “best of” radiotherapy compared to the “best
of” endoscopic head and neck surgery in patients with T1-T2,
N0 squamous cell carcinoma (EORTC 1420). This study will in-
clude stage I and II tonsil, glosso-tonsillar sulcus, lateralised base
of tongue as well as lateral pharyngeal wall squamous cell carci-
noma. The study is in preparation and was expected to start ac-
cruing patients around mid-2016. Treatment of the neck will be
with surgery or radiotherapy depending on the randomisation.
The primary outcome will be the assessment of swallowing func-
tion within the first year after the two treatment strategies. Sec-
ondary outcomes include locoregional tumour control rate at one
and two years, overall survival at one, two and five years, functional
assessment at two years, complication rate at two years, quality
of life up to two years and cost-effectiveness. One hundred and
seventy patients will be randomised to demonstrate a difference
between the two treatment arms of at least eight points on the
MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory swallowing scale.
Risk of bias in included studies
We found no completed studies that met the inclusion criteria.

Summary of main results
Unfortunately, although we deemed two randomised controlled
trials suitable for inclusion, neither are complete (EORTC 1420;
ORATOR). The earliest results are expected in 2021.
Quality of the evidence
Most studies were either retrospective or prospective in design
without evidence of randomisation. The two randomised trials
with adequate inclusion criteria will report from 2021. The overall
risk of bias is therefore unclear at present.
Potential biases in the review process
The search for this topic is comprehensive and up to date to
November 2016, allowing for identification of all appropriate
studies. We made some minor post hoc changes to our proto-
col (Howard 2014), which are described in Differences between
protocol and review.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
This review is in agreement with other reviews in that there are no
prospective data available on oncologic or quality of life outcomes
for patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving endoscopic head
and neck surgery alone compared with radiotherapy/chemoradio-
therapy.
De Almeida et al reviewed the literature and found similar on-
cologic outcomes at two years when comparing eight intensity-
modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and 12 transoral robotic surgery
studies (de Almeida 2014). The main difference they found be-
tween the two groups was in the adverse outcomes. For IMRT
these were: gastrostomy tube (43%), oesophageal stenosis (4.8%)
and osteoradionecrosis (2.6%). For transoral robotic surgery these
were: fistula (2.5%), haemorrhage (2.4%) or gastrostomy tube at
the time of surgery (1.4%) or during adjuvant therapy (30%).
Morisod et al examined the literature for survival post radiother-
apy or endoscopic head and neck surgery (transoral robotic surgery
and transoral laser microsurgery) for early oropharyngeal squa-
mous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (T1-2, N0, M0) (Morisod 2016).
When analysing studies published from 2004 onwards they found
no difference in five-year overall and disease-specific survival. Lo-
coregional failure rates were similar (21.3% radiotherapy versus
15.2% endoscopic head and neck surgery) but salvage success rates
appeared better after endoscopic head and neck surgery (50.1%
radiotherapy versus 93.6% endoscopic head and neck surgery),
although these data were not present in all studies. This review is
limited as it did not stratify by IMRT or conformal radiotherapy.
Also, the endoscopic head and neck surgery trials had a high de-
gree of heterogeneity.
Yeh et al reviewed the literature and found 14 studies following
IMRT and six following transoral robotic surgery (Yeh 2015).
They found similar disease-free survival between the two modali-
ties. The follow-up was generally longer in the IMRT studies (~2.5
years) than in the transoral robotic surgery studies (~1.5 years).
No meta-analysis was performed, possibly due to incompatibility/
heterogeneity of the data.
Tracheostomy, gastrostomy and quality of life
De Almeida et al found that there were no recorded tracheostomies
in the IMRT studies (de Almeida 2014). Tracheostomy was re-
quired for 12% of transoral robotic surgery patients at the time of
surgery with the majority decannulated prior to discharge.
For transoral robotic surgery, with the exception of one study
where 100% of patients had a gastrostomy tube (a protocol that
has now changed), the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy rate
14

 was low, with three studies giving a cumulative rate of 1.4% (2/
139) at the time of surgery, and two studies quoting 0% and 2%
rates at one year. For patients requiring adjuvant treatment this
rose to 30% (32/107) in the three studies reporting this. The rate
was 43% for the three IMRT studies reporting this outcome.
Validity of the comparison can be criticised in that there were only
772 transoral robotic surgery patients (502 T1-2) compared to
1337 IMRT patients (1010 T1-2). There was significant hetero-
geneity between studies, which may have been exacerbated by the
inclusion of studies with over 75% of participants with low T stage
and any N stage. Patients with advanced disease may therefore
have been included with resultant increases in the rates of con-
current chemotherapy and neck dissection. This may explain the
high frequency of adjuvant treatment found in both the IMRT
and transoral robotic surgery trials although early experience (pa-
tient selection and technical expertise) is likely to have played a
role too.
Yeh et al found three IMRT and nine transoral robotic surgery
papers quoting tracheostomy dependency at one year (Yeh 2015).
This ranged from 0.1% to 4.5% for the IMRT studies and 0%
to 3.5% for the transoral robotic surgery studies. Seven of the
transoral robotic surgery studies had no tracheostomies.
Feeding tube dependence at one year was available in 14 IMRT
and 13 transoral robotic surgery studies. For IMRT studies the
average was 6.1% (range 0% to 18%) and was more likely in older,
higher N stage, greater pack-year smoking history or concurrent
chemotherapy patients. For transoral robotic surgery studies the
average was 3.8% (range 0% to 20.7%). The study with a 20.7%
rate, Al-Khudari 2013, included salvage and advanced cases, and
no patients who underwent transoral robotic surgery alone were
feeding tube dependent. Five of the 13 transoral robotic surgery
studies had no cases dependent.
The authors also looked at quality of life and swallowing out-
comes, however there was very little consensus on the scoring or
scales used, which precluded more formal comparison. Two stud-
ies compared swallowing quality of life between IMRT and tran-
soral robotic surgery. More et al found that at 6 and 12 months
patients treated with transoral robotic surgery and adjuvant treat-
ment had significantly better (MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventor
scores; More 2013). Chenetal foundnostatistical difference, how-
ever the swallowing scores were better (91.5 versus 72.1) (Chen
2015).
Rathod et al reviewed the literature on quality of life outcomes
in surgery versus radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy for OPSCC (
Rathod 2015). Unfortunately, no study met their inclusion criteria
(endoscopic head and neck surgery or IMRT), preventing a meta-
analysis of the results.
Margins and adjuvant treatment
Cracchiolo et al searched the National Cancer Data Base for T1-
2 OPSCC patients from 2004 and found that 25% of patients
treated with primary surgery (both open and endoscopic) had
positive margins, and 25% had extracapsular spread (Cracchiolo
2016). The rate of positive margins was highest in 2007 (34%)
and lowest in 2013 (18%) and decreased significantly with time (P
< 0.0001). The authors suggested a possible correlation between
the peak value and the early work with transoral robotic surgery.
Higher-volume centres had fewer positive margins (P < 0.0001)
and were more likely to use surgical management than lower-
volume centres. Surgery was also more likely to be used for patients
with a lower nodal status (P < 0.0001) and who were younger.
Of the patients treated with surgery with full pathological staging
available 47% of candidates originally suitable for monotherapy
(T1-2, N0-1) had at least one adverse factor (T3-4, N2-3, positive
margins or extracapsular spread).
Concerns have been raised regarding the proportion of endoscopic
head and neck surgery patients requiring adjuvant treatment and
thereby nullifying some of the potential gains regarding treatment
de-escalation (Huang 2015), and placing them at risk of complica-
tions, for example soft tissue necrosis (Hee 2016; Luckens 2014).
Huang et al found that only 11% to 36% of primary surgical cases
were treated with transoral robotic surgery alone, with 15% to
54% rates of postoperative radiotherapy and 11% to 63% rates of
postoperative chemoradiotherapy, raising concerns regarding ap-
propriate patient selection (Huang 2015). Notably the adjuvant
treatment rate for transoral robotic surgery appears to be decreas-
ing with time. Recent data from the safety monitoring committee
for ECOG E3311 reveal that a majority of patients (69%) have
avoided concurrent chemoradiation (Holsinger 2015).
The presence of extracapsular spread is an important factor in-
fluencing the rate of adjuvant treatment. In surgically treated pa-
tients, according to the SEER database, the incidence of extracap-
sular spread in OPSCC is 23% (Byrd 2016). The relevance of ex-
tracapsular spread as a high-risk feature in HPV-positive OPSCC
has been questioned (Sinha 2012). The ADEPT trial (currently
in progress) is specifically investigating this and may result in a
change in the guidelines in the future.
It is worth remembering that whilst current efforts are focused
on de-escalation and the avoidance of triple therapy, a proportion
of primary radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy patients will also re-
quire salvage surgery and to a certain extent this is unavoidable at
present (de Almeida 2014). Furthermore, surgical treatment also
provides valuable pathological staging information, which may be
especially helpful in HPV-negative patients (Byrd 2016).
Transoral robotic surgery has also been employed for salvage
surgery. White et al found that TNM stage-matched patients
who underwent salvage transoral robotic surgery rather than open
surgery had a significantly lower incidence of tracheostomy (P <
0.001) and feeding tube (P < 0.001), and a shorter hospital stay
(White 2013). Whilst the healing time is prolonged for these pa-
tients (in the context of prior radiation) the two-year disease-free
survival rate was also significantly higher (74% versus 43%; P =
0.01) for the transoral robotic surgery group.

 Cost
In terms of cost, transoral robotic surgery has been shown to
be cheaper than open surgery for the treatment of OPSCC (Yeh
2015). De Almeida et al found that there was a cost saving as-
sociated with transoral robotic surgery over IMRT, however this
was lost in low-volume centres and with the addition of adjuvant
treatment (de Almeida 2014).
In summary, the current literature reports mainly heterogeneous
and retrospective data. The cumulative evidence would suggest
an equivalent survival rate for both IMRT and endoscopic head
and neck surgery. Tracheostomy rates are similar with possibly
better quality of life, feeding tube and swallowing outcomes for
endoscopic head and neck surgery. Rates of positive margins are
decreasing with time and these (along with costs) appear to be
better at high-volume centres.
Whilst concerns have been raised regarding high rates of adjuvant
treatment (reported in retrospective trials), this appears to improv-
ing as evidenced by early data from current randomised controlled
trials. Furthermore, the results of trials currently in progress may
change future guidelines, allowing more patients to receive de-es-
calated treatment.

Implications for practice
Based on this review, there is currently no high-quality evidence
from randomised controlled trials regarding clinical outcomes for
patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving endoscopic head and
neck surgery compared with primary chemoradiotherapy. We can-
not therefore present any evidence that would suggest any change
of practice.
Implications for research
Further trials are clearly required in this area. Since the protocol
for this review was approved endoscopic head and neck surgery
has progressed from being used solely for early-stage oropharyn-
geal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) to also being used for
late-stage disease. Future reviews comparing endoscopic head and
neck surgery with radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy should there-
fore include this important group of patients.
Furthermore, the altered tumour biology and behaviour associated
with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive OPSCC mean that
the potential for ’de-escalation’ of the adjuvant treatment (hope-
fully with reduced treatment-associated toxicity) has become a fur-
ther area for research. The possibilities for de-escalation of adju-
vant treatment are more varied and include reduction of the total
radiotherapy dose dependent on the stage of disease, removal of
chemotherapy, or both. Studies investigating this are in progress,
however it will be several years before they report their findings
and the evidence base develops. Given the large number of poten-
tial strategies for de-escalation, further trials directly comparing
these for patients at all stages of disease would be welcome.

ORATOR
Trial name or title
A phase II randomised trial for early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: radiotherapy vs trans-
oral robotic surgery (ORATOR)
Methods
Parallel-group randomised controlled trial
Participants
Inclusion criteria:
• Age 18 or older
• Willing to provide informed consent
• ECOG performance status 0-2
• Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma primary tumour site in the oropharynx (includes
tonsil, soft palate, base of tongue, walls of oropharynx)
• Tumour stage: T1 or T2, with likely negative resections at surgery
• Nodal stage: N0, N1 (<= 3 cm) or N2 (up to 2 nodes between 1 cm and 3 cm, on either side of the
neck), without extranodal extension on pre-randomisation imaging
• Patient assessed at head and neck multidisciplinary clinic (with assessment by radiation oncologist and
surgeon) and presented at multidisciplinary tumour board prior to randomisation
Exclusion criteria:
• Serious medical comorbidities or other contraindications to radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery
• Prior history of head and neck cancer within 5 years
• Prior head and neck radiation at any time
• Metastatic disease
• Inability to attend full course of radiotherapy or follow-up visits
• Neck disease with unknown primary site
• Prior invasive malignant disease unless disease-free for at least 5 years or more, with the exception of
non-melanoma skin cancer
• Unable or unwilling to complete QOL questionnaires
Interventions
Experimental:
TORS + neck dissection using Da Vinci Robot. Cautery spatula. 1 cm margins. Frozen sections + proceed
until negative margins if feasible
Comparator:
Radiotherapy ± chemotherapy
Gross tumour and nodes: 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks. High-risk nodal areas: 63 Gy in 35 fractions
over 7 weeks. Low-risk nodal areas: 56 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks
Outcomes
Primary:
• QOL (time frame: 1 year post-treatment)
Secondary:
• Overall survival (time frame: at the end of 3 years and at the end of 5 years)
• Progression-free survival (time frame: at the end of 3 years and at the end of 5 years)
• Quality of life at other time points (time frame: every 6 months for 5 years from 1st date of treatment)
• Toxicity (time frame: 5 years from date of first treatment)
• Swallowing function (time frame: 5 years from date of first treatment)

Title:
• ’Early-stage’ changed to ’small-volume, primary’. The same clarification was carried through the entire review.
Background:
• Addition of work by Schache 2016 and new HPV demographic data.
Methods section:
• Types of studies clarified to exclude quasi- and cluster-randomised trials.
• Types of interventions: clarification of planned comparisons.
• Types of outcome measures: addition of statement to meet MECIR standards whereby studies are not included or excluded
based on outcome measures; addition of further details of anticipated/allowable measurement instruments.
