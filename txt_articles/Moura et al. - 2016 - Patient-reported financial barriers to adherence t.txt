Objective: Many effective medical therapies are available for treating neurological diseases, 
but these therapies tend to be expensive and adherence is critical to their effectiveness. We 
used patient-reported data to examine the frequency and determinants of financial barriers to 
medication adherence among individuals treated for neurological disorders.
Patients and methods: Patients completed cross-sectional surveys on iPads as part of 
routine outpatient care in a neurology clinic. Survey responses from a 3-month period were 
collected and merged with administrative sources of demographic and clinical information 
(eg, insurance type). We explored the association between patient characteristics and patient-
reported failure to refill prescription medication due to cost in the previous 12 months, termed 
here as “nonadherence”.
Results: The population studied comprised 6075 adults who were presented between July and 
September 2015 for outpatient neurology appointments. The mean age of participants was 56 
(standard deviation: 18) years, and 1613 (54%) were females. The patients who participated in 
the surveys (2992, 49%) were comparable to nonparticipants with respect to gender and ethnic-
ity but more often identified English as their preferred language (94% vs 6%, p<0.01). Among 
respondents, 9.8% (n=265) reported nonadherence that varied by condition. These patients 
were more frequently Hispanic (16.7% vs 9.8% white, p=0.01), living alone (13.9% vs 8.9% 
cohabitating, p<0.01), and preferred a language other than English (15.3% vs 9.4%, p=0.02).
Conclusion: Overall, the magnitude of financial barriers to medication adherence appears to 
vary across neurological conditions and demographic characteristics.
Keywords: outcomes, adherence, cost
Introduction
There is a growing armamentarium of effective medical therapies to treat neurological 
diseases.1,2 National guidelines have discussed ten US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-approved disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis, >20 FDA-approved 
antiepileptic drugs for seizure prophylaxis, and 23 drugs involved in stroke preven-
tion, including novel oral anticoagulants.3–5 Most of these therapies are expensive and 
adherence is critical to their effectiveness.6–8
Medication adherence depends on many factors, including affordable access to 
drugs, which varies by drug type and insurance-benefit design. For instance, Medicare 
beneficiaries obtain outpatient drug coverage through the Part D program, which is 
administered by private insurance plans, i.e., Part D drug plans. The formulary protec-
tions of these plans apply to formulary inclusion, but not tier placement. The resulting 
differences in out-of-pocket payments can be challenging for beneficiaries with limited

incomes or impaired cognition.9 In addition, since adher-
ence depends mainly on patient reporting and perception, 
it has been demonstrated that many patients who claim to 
have been adherent to their medications are in fact not.10,11 
According to a recent study on therapeutic drug monitoring 
in consecutive emergency hospital admissions for seizures, 
>40% of nonadherent patients claimed to have been adherent 
when further asked about medication failure.12
Medication nonadherence has been shown to seriously 
hurt health outcomes in neurology, and hence efforts to 
understand the causes and solutions to this problem have 
become increasingly important. Some studies have shown 
a moderate association between drug choice, adherence, 
and satisfaction with treatment.7,13 Previous studies of 
medication  
nonadherence in neurology have been limited 
to population-wide databases and reliable claims-based 
algorithms.14–24 These large-scale approaches to the evalua-
tion of medication adherence using retrospective electronic 
health records (EHRs) abstraction or claims data have missed 
critical information and fallen short in representing the real-
world complexity.25 In an effort to capture more accurate, 
specific, and informative data on medication nonadherence, 
systematic collection of patient-reported outcomes offers 
great promise.26,27
The term “patient-reported outcomes” refers to data 
directly collected from patients such as self-administered 
surveys and other attempts to quantify patients’ behavior and 
their subjective experience of health. Patient-reported data 
have been shown to correlate with and augment more typical 
clinical measurements, proving useful in the assessment of 
treatment outcomes and determinants of health.28–31
This study examined the frequency and determinants of 
financial barriers to medication adherence among individuals 
treated for neurological disorders using patient-reported data.
Patients and methods
Participants
This study was a retrospective review of data collected 
as part of a quality improvement project implemented 
in Neurology Ambulatory clinical practices that began 
in July 2015 and continues to date. Since July 2015, all 
ambulatory neurology patients in the outpatient waiting 
room aged 18+ years have been offered an iPad survey 
upon arrival at the office, except for unaccompanied non-
English speakers, whose eligibility was determined by 
front desk staff based on the patient’s observed inability 
to understand very simple survey directions. The front 
desk staff had received standard institutional training to 
determine patients’ ability to read and sign check-in-related 
documents (eg, insurance-driven pre-office forms). All 
patients were given the opportunity to verbally opt out of 
the survey and were reminded that the quality of their care 
would not be adversely affected by survey completion. 
Patients who arrived late for appointments or had other 
essential tasks to complete prior to the physician visit were 
at times unable to complete the survey prior to the end of 
the office visit. Although longitudinal data were captured 
for patients with several visits during this period, only the 
first visit was included in the analysis.7,32,33
Procedures and measurements
This study combines information from the survey merged 
by deterministic linkage using the medical record number to 
administrative and clinical data gathered using a Research 
Patient Data Registry (RPDR) query tool.
Survey
In ambulatory neurology clinics, patients were checked in 
by front desk staff before being seen by the provider. After 
determining patient appropriateness, the front desk staff 
handed patients an iPad tablet pre-loaded with the survey 
questions. Patients completed the survey in the waiting room. 
Before beginning, they were prompted to read and agree to 
an informed consent disclaimer, which they signed on the 
Apple iPad2 (Apple, CA, USA) screen. A report summarizing 
the patients’ survey responses became available in the EHR 
immediately upon completion, and providers were encour-
aged to review this information with the patient.
The survey had four parts – an introduction, demographic 
questions, and the medication adherence question, “How 
often in the past 12 months did you decide not to fill or refill 
your prescription because the medicines cost too much?” 
with the answers “often”, “sometimes”, “never”, and “prefer 
not to answer”. After this question, the survey included an 
additional questionnaire to measure global health function, 
which is not the focus of this article and is detailed in the 
Supplementary materials.
RPDR query tool
We anticipated that not all patients would be able to partici-
pate in the survey. To determine the primary predictors of 
participation and examine the potential for selection bias, 
we gathered additional demographic information using the 
Partners Healthcare Clinical data registry for all arriving 
patients (both participating and nonparticipating in the 
survey) seen in the Ambulatory Neurology clinics during 
the study time frame. The RPDR is a clinical data registry 
that aggregates data from sources throughout the Partners

Patient-reported financial barriers to medication adherence
Healthcare System (PHS), including the medical record, 
reports, claims, and administrative systems. Queried vari-
ables included age, gender, preferred language, insurance 
status, ethnicity, marital status, and clinic type (eg, general 
 
neurology vs subspecialty area).
Results of the RPDR query identified patients scheduled 
for an ambulatory neurology clinical visit from July 2015 to 
September 2015. A member of the study staff reviewed the 
RPDR query output to exclude ineligible patients or encoun-
ters. Eligible encounters were the patients >18 years of age 
seen at the neurology outpatient clinic (main campus only), 
who had a first visit or were established patients who came 
for a follow-up visit within the study time frame (subsequent 
visits were excluded). There were 6075 eligible visits.
Statistical analysis
We defined cost-related medication nonadherence as an 
answer of “often” or “sometimes” to the question “How 
often in the past 12 months did you decide not to fill or refill 
a prescription because the medicines cost too much?”.
We performed univariate comparisons of the baseline 
characteristics of the adherence groups using two-group two-
sided t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for 
categorical variables. In multivariable analysis, we utilized 
logistic regression models to assess the associations between 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with 
the report of cost-related medication nonadherence. The inde-
pendent variables were selected based on prior knowledge 
and examination of the distribution of the univariate analysis. 
Conservatively, no step-wise approach was used.
To address the potential for selection bias in our 
respondents, we performed univariate analysis of covari-
ates associated with survey participation (participants vs 
nonparticipants, including age, gender, ethnicity, preferred 
language, insurance type, marital status, and clinic type).
We used SAS Studio®, version 9.4 for statistical analysis.
This study was conducted under a protocol approved by 
the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board.
Results
A total of 2992 out of 6075 patients participated in the survey 
and 2716 fully completed the survey questions, yielding a 
participation rate of 49% and a completion rate of 45% 
 
(Figure S1). The mean age of participants was 56 (SD: 18) 
years and 1613 (54%) were females. Respondents were 
comparable to nonrespondents with respect to gender and 
ethnicity. Survey responders more often identified English 
as their preferred language (90.6%, p=0.02; Table S1).
Among the participants, 9.8% (n=265) of patients 
reported cost-related medication nonadherence. More 
specifically, nonadherent patients “often” (40 or 15.1%) or 
“sometimes” (225 or 84.9%) failed to fill or refill a prescrip-
tion (Figure 1).
Table 1 summarizes the distribution of sociodemographic 
indicators among nonadherent vs adherent patients. Patients 
who reported cost-related nonadherence were younger (mean 
age: 53±16 years vs 56±18 years, p<0.01), more often His-
panic (16.7% vs 9.8%, p<0.01), had a native language that 
was not English (22% vs 9.4%, p=0.02), and were not cur-
rently partnered (single, separated, divorced, or widowed vs 
married; 11.9% vs 8.5%, p<0.01).
In multivariable analysis, care in subspecialty clinics, 
compared to general neurology clinic as the reference, was 
associated with higher rates of patient-reported nonadher-
ence. Stroke clinical patients had twice the odds ratio (OR) of 
nonadherence (OR =2.09, 95% CI: 1.05–4.16), and memory 
disorder clinical patients had more than threefold increase 
(OR =3.73, 95% CI: 1.31–10.59; Figure S2). A sensitivity 
analysis using both marital status and cohabitation in a mul-
tivariable logistic regression did not significantly impact the 
reported results.
Discussion
We have presented a cross-sectional study of cost-related 
medication nonadherence to use in a patient-reported survey 
conducted in a large cohort of neurology patients. Our results 
suggest that the prevalence of financial barriers to medication 
adherence is modest (<10%). These findings were consistent 
with those presented in the study of Campbell et al,34 who 
found that trouble affording medications was the fourth 
leading reason for medication nonadherence among elderly 
patients.

However, the comparison of our cost-related non-adher-
ence rates with the current literature is limited by the general 
lack of congruence in the way adherence is measured and 
reported. Most other medication adherence studies have either 
evaluated patients in controlled settings with small sample 
sizes or used claims data to measure patient prescription 
refills. In comparison, our survey describes the patient report 
of the burden of financial barriers to medication adherence.35,36
In addition, to reduce potential for both recall and inter-
viewer bias, we collected data from patients immediately 
before their clinical visits. We believe that collecting data from 
patients immediately before their clinical visits yielded more 
accurate results because the patients were already prompted to 
think about their health problems and medications in use. Also, 
having to complete the survey in the waiting room allowed 
the patients to have ready access to staff members and clarify 
the meaning of any question they found hard to interpret. 
In comparison, this would not be possible in a paper-based 
form sent out after clinic.37–41 Of note, our participation and 
completion rates (49% and 45%, respectively) were similar 
to the rates obtained in previous similar studies.42–46
A second interesting finding was that patients seen at the 
memory disorders clinic, which includes primarily patients 
with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias who were 
almost always accompanied by a care giver, were especially 
vulnerable to financial barriers to medication adherence, even 
after adjusting for pertinent socioeconomic factors. This find-
ing is particularly concerning because these patients tend to 
be older, and medication adherence by older patients is lower 
compared to younger patients due to increased side effects 
as well.47–49 These older- and cognitively impaired adults are 
clinically vulnerable due to concurrent medical illnesses and 
drug interactions.47–49 Studies have shown that the number and 
types of co-morbidities, such as depression, are predictors 
of cost-related nonadherence.36,37 This is especially striking 
since most of these patients are Medicare eligible and so 
would not be expected to have large out-of-pocket expenses 
for many tests, procedures, or hospitalizations.
Observational retrospective studies using claims data 
(prescription fills) have suggested that drug-benefit design 
and tier strategies (i.e., prescription drug coverage) may 
also affect adherence to treatment.50 Adding complexity to 
this problem, McWilliams et al9 showed that Medicare ben-
eficiaries with low cognitive function were less responsive 
to the generosity of Medicare Advantage benefits in their 
decisions (i.e., multiple and complex insurance plan benefit 
choices negatively impacted seniors with impaired decision 
making). Our study findings build upon the existing literature

Patient-reported financial barriers to medication adherence
and highlight the complex interaction of multiple socioeco-
nomic and clinical factors in cost-related nonadherence.35
In this study, patients from socially disadvantaged back-
grounds, such as Hispanics and non-English speakers, also 
appear to be more likely to report having financial barriers to 
medication adherence.51 Our study supports other groups that 
have presented data on how people of lower socioeconomic 
status and ethnic minorities report higher rates of cost-related 
medication nonadherence.37,47,52–57
While many studies focused on examining the adherence 
to a specific medication, we asked a broad question about any 
medication, which allowed for a cross-clinic comparison.58 In 
the case of patients with Alzheimer’s disease in our memory 
disorders clinic, our study findings remain consistent with 
studies about the recent rising costs of neurology prescrip-
tion drugs, which ultimately indicates more out-of-pocket 
spending for this population.5 For example, an analysis of 
Medicare Part D data revealed that neurologists comprised 
only 1.2% of prescribing providers but expenditures with 
neurology-prescribed medications were the third highest of 
all specialties. Medications for multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, 
and Alzheimer’
s disease and related dementias were the major 
drivers of the exceptional costs ($5 billion in 2013).5
Finally, this study is aligned with the existing literature 
that suggests that patient reporting and the linking of multiple 
sources of data have been shown to improve the accuracy of 
research findings.59,60
This study had many important limitations. Most notably, 
the trade-off in asking a broad medication adherence question 
and absence of data from chart abstraction is that we may 
not have captured the specific medication that is the princi-
pal reason for the financial barrier in each clinical scenario. 
For instance, aspirin is an important medication prescribed 
for patients with stroke. This medication is relatively of low 
cost and is classified as Tier 1, designating medications that 
are largely covered, according to the most common insur-
ance policies. For patients with stroke, we believe that the 
culprit might be the related medications often prescribed in 
patients with stroke, such as anticoagulants and medications 
for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pain management.58,61
In addition, other broad wordings that serve as a limitation 
of our study were such as the categorical scale with frequency 
options (eg, “often”, “sometimes”, and “never”). The mean-
ings of these frequency words can vary among individuals. 
Perhaps, an open-ended question could yield a more specific 
measurement (eg, “How many days in a month would you 
miss a medication?”). However, the likelihood that a patient 
would be able to provide an accurate numerical value with 
respect to adherence over the past 12 months would be low. 
Therefore, we considered categorical scales easier to respond 
and opted to use simple frequency words.
A second major limitation was that we were unable to 
distinguish between patients who declined to participate and 
patients who were not approached, due to the aforementioned 
exclusion criteria and administrative errors. The absence of 
these data prevents further characterization of potentially con-
founding participant vs nonparticipant differences. In addition, 
we excluded unaccompanied non-English speakers and unac-
companied patients with severe cognitive impairment. Both the 
criteria were determined after a patient-handed survey based 
on self-reported or observed inability to follow basic survey 
directions. Also, 275 patients (9%) started the survey but did 
not complete the medication adherence question. The reasons 
for leaving the survey incomplete include the early call from 
the treating physician (eg, when there is <10 minutes of wait-
ing time from check-in to the encounter with the physician), 
fatigue (eg, patients get tired and give up), and distractions 
(eg, patients answer phone calls and leave the survey aside). 
Another limitation that exists with the study population is that 
the research team did not consider other impairments, such as 
visual impairment, as one of the exclusion criteria due to the 
fact that patients were likely to visit with a designated proxy. 
Because the patients were self-answering the survey in the 
context of a busy neurology clinic, we were unable to track 
specific reasons for survey exclusion and incompletion.
This study has limited generalizability to nonacademic 
medical centers as is common to many similar studies.11,22 How-
ever, it is hoped that the findings are more generalizable due to 
the high participation and completion rates. We did not identify 
patients who were nonadherent because of nonfinancial reasons, 
and therefore the comparison arm of our analysis includes some 
patients who were nonadherent due to other reasons.
Next, this study did not prospectively capture adherence 
following the prescription of a specific medication, making 
causal association in our study impossible. The clinical value 
of our study was demonstrated in the secondary analysis. As 
outlined earlier, this study made note of a potential associa-
tion between patients being seen in certain clinics that may 
prescribe more expensive medications, such as those for 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, 
suggesting that they may have a higher cost-sharing burden.
Finally, residual measured and unmeasured confounding 
may exist, such as the cost per drug tier in each patient’s insur-
ance coverage formulary. We would expect that the patients 
with cost-related nonadherence would have been most often 
prescribed medications in the highest cost tier, as described 
in previous studies.62 However, we were not able to examine 
if nonadherence was related to drug tier and co-pay as we did

not have reliable access to each patient’s pharmacy benefit 
to determine these interactions.
Despite these limitations, this study offers opportunities 
to improve outcomes in neurology patients through medica-
tion adherence and drive health policy in neurology. There 
are many possible future studies and solutions to the issues 
we have outlined. 1) Patients could be encouraged to reduce 
their medication costs by requesting generic medications or 
using mail order pharmacies. 2) More assistance for patients 
in navigating health insurance and therapeutic choices might 
reduce nonadherence to medication regimens among patients 
with neurological conditions. 3) Value-based drug pricing 
(varying payments for medications based on outcomes or 
magnitude of clinical benefits) may be another means of 
engaging patients, physicians, and payers toward improving 
adherence and outcomes.
Our study also sought to improve the discussions between 
patients and treating physicians about prices of medications. 
We present the medication adherence question to the patients 
before their visit in order to prompt the patients to discuss 
any prescription filling problems with the treating physician 
during the encounter. However, patients still have difficulty 
starting this conversation and may only realize the amount of 
co-pay when they go to pick up their refill after the clinical 
visit. We encourage quality improvement strategies, such as 
using electronic notifications of answers to the cost-related 
nonadherence question, in order to encourage the physicians 
to incite these discussions about financial issues. Future 
studies should also integrate patient-reported information 
into insurance-benefit designs in order to measure the actual 
ratio of adherence to out-of-pocket spending, per patient and 
by treatment period.
Conclusion
This study suggests that while the overall level of poor 
adherence due to costs is limited, cost-related barriers to 
medication adherence appear to be concentrated among the 
most cognitively- and socioeconomically vulnerable patients. 
Multiple strategies are needed to prospectively identify these 
vulnerable patients and to alter prescribing practices to 
enhance affordability and thereby long-term efficacy.

Patient-reported financial barriers to medication adherence
Supplementary materials
Additional survey details
The survey was administered on an Apple iPad2 (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA), with a plastic cover to allow for easy grip 
and identification in the busy outpatient setting of a major academic neurology clinic. The survey questions were built using 
the Tonic for Health platform (Tonic Solutions Inc., CA, USA), a survey software tool that allowed intuitive survey construc-
tion, and integration with the Apple iPad iOS (version 8 and beyond) and the hospital’s electronic health record (EHR). All 
data were stored in a repository compliant with the hospital’s privacy policies.
In addition to the measures described in the main manuscript, we also collected the NIH PROMIS-10. The NIH PRO-
MIS-10 is a short form that measures a patient’s perceived physical and mental health. The PROMIS-10 has been validated 
in populations with different neurological diseases (eg, stroke, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease) as well as without neuro-
logical diseases and attempt to measure patient-reported physical and mental function.1
