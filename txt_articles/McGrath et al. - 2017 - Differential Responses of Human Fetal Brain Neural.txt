SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes microcephaly in a subset of infants born to infected pregnant mothers. It is unknown whether human
individual differences contribute to differential susceptibility of ZIKV-related neuropathology. Here, we use an Asian-lineage ZIKV strain,
isolated from the 2015 Mexican outbreak (Mex1-7), to infect primary human neural stem cells (hNSCs) originally derived from three in-
dividual fetal brains. All three strains of hNSCs exhibited similar rates of Mex1-7 infection and reduced proliferation. However, Mex1-7
decreased neuronal differentiation in only two of the three stem cell strains. Correspondingly, ZIKA-mediated transcriptome alterations
were similar in these two strains but significantly different from that of the third strain with no ZIKV-induced neuronal reduction. This
study thus confirms that an Asian-lineage ZIKV strain infects primary hNSCs and demonstrates a cell-strain-dependent response of
hNSCs to ZIKV infection.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a global public
health threat with 70 countries and territories reporting
active ZIKV transmission (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2016a). ZIKV is a flavivirus transmitted
by the Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes with
recent outbreaks in the Americas, including in Brazil and
Mexico (Kindhauser et al., 2016; Guerbois et al., 2016).
Currently, there are two principal lineages of ZIKV, African
and Asian (Haddow et al., 2012; Kindhauser et al., 2016;
Weaver et al., 2016). Only the Asian lineage has been asso-
ciated with fetal microcephaly and other neurological ab-
normalities such as Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome, whereas few
infections with the African lineage have been described
(Broutet et al., 2016; Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; Kindhauser
et al., 2016; Paploski et al., 2016; Weaver et al., 2016).
Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
officially confirmed the link between microcephaly and
ZIKV infection, as well as the capability of ZIKV to be sexu-
ally transmitted (Hills et al., 2016). While ZIKV typically re-
sults in mild or asymptomatic infections in healthy adults
or children, the risk of microcephaly and other serious
neurological deficits in the developing fetus is an alarming
consequence of ZIKV infection and thus is a serious health
problem worldwide (Brasil et al., 2016).
Microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder where
the head is smaller than the typical size during fetal devel-
opment and at birth, with the circumference less than 2
SDs below the mean (Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, 2016b). Babies with microcephaly can have a wide
array of problems such as developmental delays, seizures,
vision and hearing loss, and feeding difficulty. To date, little
is known about the mechanism underlying ZIKV-associ-
ated microcephaly. Since a normal brain develops from
neural stem cells (NSCs) and their differentiated neural
cells, microcephaly is most likely associated with the
abnormal function of these cells. Yet, many questions
remain to be addressed, such as how human fetal brain
NSCs or their progeny are susceptible to ZIKV infection,
whether different strains of ZIKV infect NSCs with equal ef-
ficiency, if such infection affects functions of NSCs impor-
tant in human brain development, and whether NSCs from
different human origins respond to ZIKV equally. Recent
evidence shows that ZIKV directly infects NSCs of the fetus
and impairs growth in mice (Li et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016).

 It has also been shown that ZIKV infects neural progenitors
from human skin-cell-induced pluripotent stem cells
(Garcez et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016), but these studies
used the murine neuro-adapted prototype strain (MR766)
belonging to the African lineage. A more recent study
showed that a 2015 Puerto Rico strain of ZIKV, PRVABC59,
infects and kills primary human fetal neural progenitors
(Hanners et al., 2016). However, none of these studies
investigated the effect of ZIKV on neural stem cell func-
tions, particularly their differentiation into neurons and
glial cells, which is critical for brain development.
We used several strains of human fetal brain-derived
NSCs (hNSCs) and evaluated the effects of recent ZIKV
outbreak strains on their infection, proliferation, and dif-
ferentiation. To distinguish from genetically modified cell
lines, we refer to these non-genetically modified hNSCs
as hNSC strains. We found that Mex1-7 was able to infect
hNSCs and decrease proliferation in all strains but altered
neuronal differentiation in only two of the hNSC strains.
Transcriptome analyses also revealed cell-strain-dependent
upregulation of genes associated with innate immunity
and apoptotic cell death and downregulation of genes asso-
ciated with cell-cycle progression and neurogenesis. The
in vitro primary hNSC system will be critically important
for further mechanistic studies of ZIKV strain and human
neural damage and for providing insights into novel thera-
peutic developments.
RESULTS
Infection of Primary hNSCs by Asian and African
Lineages of ZIKV
Three primary strains of hNSCs were derived from three
male donor brains at the gestational age of 9 weeks
(K048) or 13 weeks (G010 and K054). ZIKV infectivity
and all other analyses of these hNSCs were carried out at
passage number 22. Fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) analysis revealed that the three cell strains main-
tained a normal cytogenetic profile with very few cells
showing chromosomal trisomy (Figure S1). MOIs of 1 and
10 infectious units/cell were initially used to test the infec-
tivity
of
the
following
three
ZIKV
strains:
Mex1-7,
FSS13025 (or FSS hereafter), and DakAr41525 (or DakAr).
MOIs were calculated from Vero cell focus-forming units.
Due to overall low infection rates, an MOI of 10 was chosen
for all further experiments to ensure maximum infectivity.
Mex1-7 and FSS (Asian-lineage strains) are a 2015 mosquito
isolate from an outbreak in southern Mexico (Guerbois
et al., 2016) and a 2010 human isolate from Cambodia
(Haddow et al., 2012), respectively. DakAr, on the other
hand, is a 1984 mosquito isolate from Senegal, belonging
to the African lineage. These three ZIKV strains were prop-
agated only in mosquito and African green monkey kidney
Vero cells, and particularly Mex1-7 is a newly isolated Asian
strain with very limited passage history in C6/36 mosquito
cells (three passages).
Figure 1A shows representative images from K054 hNSC
infection with Mex1-7, FSS, and DakAr 4 days post infec-
tion (4 dpi), with adsorption for 1 hr. Both FSS and DakAr
produced significantly higher titers 4 dpi compared with
Mex1-7 in all three hNSC strains. One day of ZIKV infec-
tion resulted in cell-rounding cytopathic effects as shown
in Figure 1B. Quantitative analyses of ZIKV infectivity re-
vealed that 10% and 8% of K054 cells were infected by
FSS and DakAr, respectively; whereas Mex1-7 resulted in
only �1.5% cell infection in K054, K048, and G010 hNSCs
(Figures 1C and 1D). Given the clinical relevance of Mex1-7
and the distinct difference of this strain from FSS and
DakAr, Mex1-7 was chosen for further evaluation for its ef-
fects on hNSC survival, proliferation, and differentiation.
As shown in Figure 1E, Mex1-7 infection resulted in a
change in hNSC morphology. When cultured in flasks un-
coated with adherent substances such as poly-D-lysine,
hNSCs grew as neurospheres in suspension in the absence
of ZIKV infection. However, upon the presence of ZIKV,
cells developed an adherent network structure and gradu-
ally lost sphere formation (Figure 1E).
Proliferation and Survival of Primary hNSCs Altered
by Mex1-7 Independent of Human Donor Origin
To measure the effect of ZIKV infection on hNSC prolifera-
tion, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and Ki-67 staining was
performed. BrdU incorporates into the DNA during the
S phase, and thus labels dividing cells. In this study, cells
were incubated with BrdU for 4 hr to ascertain the effect
of Mex1-7 infection on proliferation 7 dpi. As shown in
Figure 2A, no significant changes were observed in BrdU la-
beling in Mex1-7-infected cells compared with controls
(Figure 2A). Ki-67, a marker for proliferating cells, showed
a significant decrease of approximately 15% in K054 cells
but not in K048 or G010 (Figure 2B). Considering that
BrdU and Ki-67 provide information on cell proliferation
at a certain point of time, proliferation following Mex1-7
infection was further evaluated by counting cells. Initially,
1 million cells with or without Mex1-7 infection were
immediately plated into a T-25 flask and allowed to grow
for up to 11 days, then passaged, and counted. Without
ZIKV infection, the total cell number increased by about
2.8-fold in K054, 3.6-fold in K048, and 3-fold in G010 cells
(Figure 2C). In contrast, Mex1-7 infection significantly
reduced the total cell numbers compared with controls.
Mex1-7-infected cells decreased from 1 million cells by
15% in K054 (0.85 million), 23% in K048 (0.77 million),
and 10% in G010 (0.9 million) (Figure 2C). This reduction
of cells may be due to loss of cells during the passaging

 procedure. Alternatively, it could be due to cytopathic ef-
fects of ZIKV infection. However, we found that there was
no change in apoptosis in any of the cell strains following
ZIKV infection in the proliferation stage, as determined
by activated caspase-3 (Cas3) staining (Figure S2). On the
other hand, following differentiation, ZIKV-infected K054
cells had a significant 3.5-fold increase in activated Cas3,
whereas infected G010 and K048 showed no significant
change in Cas3+ cells (Figure 2D).
Differentiation of Primary hNSCs Altered by Mex 1–7
in a Human Cell Strain-Dependent Manner
To evaluate the effect of ZIKV infection on hNSC differen-
tiation, Mex1-7-innoculated G010, K048, and K054 hNSCs
were allowed to differentiate for 9 days. At 15 dpi, cells were
immunostained with markers for mature neurons (micro-
tubule-associated protein 2 or MAP2), astrocytes (glial
fibrillary acidic protein or GFAP), and ZIKV proteins.
Mex1-7 infection significantly reduced MAP2+ neurons
by approximately 33% in K054 cells and 43% in K048 cells
(Figure 3A). Interestingly, G010 neuronal differentiation
was not affected by ZIKV infection, although some
morphological changes were visible in these as well as in
K054 and K048 (Figure 3A). On the other hand, GFAP+
cell populations were not altered in any of the three
cell strains, but there was a change in cell morphology
(Figure 3B). These data suggest that hNSCs of different
individuals vary in neuronal differentiation potential
following ZIKV infection. When dual staining of ZIKV
and either GFAP or MAP2 was conducted, the majority of
Mex1-7-infected and surviving cells were GFAP+ astrocytes.
Of the ZIKV+ population, approximately 46% in K054, 64%
in K048, and 72% in G010 were double labeled with GFAP
(Figure 3C). This was significantly higher than ZIKV+ cells
dual-labeled with MAP2 for neurons which were about
26% in K054, 27% in K048, and 25% in G010 (Figure 3C).
We do not believe apoptosis to be responsible for this
decreased neurogenesis, considering less than 1.7% of cells
showed activated Cas3 staining (Figure 2D).
ZIKV-Induced Changes of Gene Expression in a
Human Cell Strain-Dependent Manner
To
investigate
the
underlying
cause
of
ZIKV-infec-
tion-related changes in neuronal differentiation, deep
sequencing of RNAs from all three strains was performed
7 dpi and after 1 day of differentiation. RNA analysis
was conducted in triplicate for each cell strain. Figure 4
shows Venn diagrams and heatmaps of significantly
changed genes based on a false discovery rate (FDR)
cutoff of <0.05, with up- or downregulation by 2-fold or
greater. Specifically, ZIKA upregulated 370 and 819 genes
in K054 and K048 cells, respectively (Figure 4A); and

 downregulated 227 and 508 genes in K054 and K048,
respectively (Figure 4B). In contrast, ZIKV-infected G010
had only 32 upregulated and 56 downregulated genes. Of
the G010 upregulated genes, 11 were shared with K048,
and only 2 shared with K054. In addition, 2 downregulated
genes in G010 were shared with K048 and 1 gene with
K054. A complete list of all ZIKV-altered genes can be found

 et al., 2005) of Hallmark pathways on these changed genes
confirmed that ZIKV-infected K048 and K054 had similar-
ity in transcriptome alteration, which was remarkably
different from that of G010 (Figure 4C). This trend was
also held for the top hit pathways related to immune
response, neurogenesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis (Figures
4D–4G, 5, and 6).
One of the most striking findings from the Hallmark
analysis was that G010 had no significantly downregulated
pathways (Figure 6). For example, doublecortin (DCX)
is a protein that regulates microtubule stability and is
commonly expressed in migratory neuroblasts or imma-
ture neurons. DCX was downregulated in both K048 and
K054, but not G010, which correlates well with the immu-
nocytochemical findings in Figure 3. Similar results were
also detected in the expression of another neuronal marker,
Tubulin Beta 3 class III (TUBB3). In addition, of the 200
genes implicated in the Hallmark pathway of the check
point progression from G2 to mitotic phase in the cell cy-
cle, K048 and K054 had 52 and 20 downregulated, respec-
tively, while G010 showed no changes (Figures 5 and 6,
Table S1). The histone cluster 1 family, particularly histone
cluster 1 H4 family member A (HIST1H4A), is implicated in
this cell-cycle progression process and was significantly
downregulated in K048 and K054 (Figure 5, Table S1).
Generally, this gene family is implicated in a wide variety
of functions, including transcriptional regulation, DNA
repair, and chromosomal architecture (Harshman et al.,
2013; Zhou et al., 2013); and particularly HIST1H4A has
been shown to be essential for DNA replication (Miotto
and Struhl, 2010). It requires further studies to determine
whether ZIKV-downregulated cell-cycling genes during
the early differentiation stage affect neuronogenesis in
the later stage. On the other hand, K048, K054, and G010
all had significantly upregulated genes associated with im-
mune and inflammatory pathways such as interferon-
gamma response; however K048 and K054 had much
greater changes when compared with G010 (Figures 5
and 6A). Of the 200 genes associated with the interferon-
gamma response pathway, K048 and K054 had 109 and
89 genes upregulated, respectively, compared with G010,
which had only 4 upregulated genes (Figure 6A). One inter-
esting gene upregulated in K048 and K054, but not
G010, was tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-induced protein 3
(TNFAIP3), which is involved in cytokine-mediated im-
mune responses. It remains to be determined whether
altered innate immune response genes contribute to
ZIKV-mediated differential deficits in neuronogenesis.
qRT-PCR analysis further confirmed the similar cell
strain-dependent trends of ZIKV-altered expression pat-
terns in several genes such as apoptotic protein FAS, neural
stem cell stemness marker SOX1, and neuron-specific
TUBB3 (Figure 6B).
DISCUSSION
Here, we established an in vitro system using primary hu-
man fetal brain-derived NSCs from three different donors
to characterize the effect of ZIKV infection. We particularly
focused on an Asian-lineage ZIKV strain, Mex1-7, that was
involved in the first outbreak in North America in late 2015
in Chiapas State (Guerbois et al., 2016). Interestingly, we
found that the Mex1-7 strain had a substantial lower infec-
tivity (1.5%) in primary hNSCs when compared with other
strains (10% by FSS and 8% by DakAr) tested in this study,
as well as compared with the 1947 African lineage MR766
strain (20%–80% infection rate) and ArB41644 strain
(40% infection rate) reported previously (Garcez et al.,
2016; Tang et al., 2016; Simonin et al., 2016). The high
infectivity of MR766 may be explained by the fact that
it has been passaged for over 150 times in suckling
mouse brains and developed a neuro-adapted phenotype,
a concern addressed previously (Miner and Diamond,
2016). An alternative explanation is that African ZIKV
strains may have a higher infectivity rate than Asian
ZIKV strains. In this study, the FSS and DakAr strains used
were passaged 3 and 7 times, respectively, only in mosquito
and mammalian cell culture and not in neural cells. On the
other hand, the source of NSCs may also contribute to the
discrepant infectivity of ZIKV. For example, our observa-
tion of less than 10% cell infection rates are more in line
with recent reports (Hanners et al., 2016). Both this, and
the fact that our study used primary cultured human fetal
brain NSCs may account for differences compared with
Tang et al. (2016) and Garcez et al. (2016) who used neural
progenitor cells derived from human skin-cell-induced
pluripotent stem cells. However, all of these results indicate
that the type of neural cells, the viral lineage/strain from
different sources, and the viral propagation methods
need to be considered when interpreting ZIKV infectivity
and functional consequences in human cells.

 Microcephaly may result from abnormal proliferation or
differentiation of NSCs during early development (Homem
et al., 2015). We thus established an in vitro system to char-
acterize the effect of Mex1-7 on survival, proliferation, and
differentiation of three primary human fetal NSC strains:
G010, K048, and K054. These three cell strains were derived
from three human fetal donors at gestational weeks 9
(K048) and 13 (K054 and G010), around the end of the first
trimester of pregnancy and within the time frame with
high risk of viral-mediated abnormal neural development,
including ZIKV-induced microcephaly (Cauchemez et al.,
2016). Further, Mex1-7 infections decreased the cell popu-
lation in all three cell strains without significant changes in
Cas3 or BrdU during the proliferation stage. The lack of
change of Cas3 could indicate that, during the proliferative
stage, cell-cycle progression is halted but cells are not un-
dergoing apoptosis. Since only a small percentage of hNSCs
are infected (1.5%), a bystander effect may be occurring to
inhibit proliferation. Alternatively, a necrotic mechanism
of cell death could account for the decreased population.
The population decrease is in general accordance with
the previous studies using either human embryonic stem
cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (Dang et al., 2016;
Garcez et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016).

 In addition to these in vitro studies, two groups have also
shown that ZIKV infection in pregnant mice leads to inhi-
bition of neural progenitor proliferation in mouse embryos
by cell-cycle arrest (Wu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016). Further
studies are warranted to dissect the mechanisms underly-
ing ZIKV inhibition of NSC proliferation both in vitro
and in animal models in vivo.
The most important contribution of our study to ZIKV
research is the finding of ZIKV-mediated impairment of
hNSC neuronal differentiation in a cell-strain-dependent
manner. Specifically, ZIKV infection significantly reduced
neuronal differentiation of K054 and K048 strains but
not G010. Both RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR also confirm
the similar trend of reduction in the expression of neuron-
specific TUBB3 gene. This cell-strain-dependent impair-
ment is unlikely related to the initial derivation of hNSC
strains from different human gestational weeks: K048 at
the week 9, and both K054 and G010 at 13. First, it is
known that there are no significant developmental mile-
stones between gestational weeks 9 and 13 (Stiles and
Jernigan, 2010). Second, K054 and G010 were both derived
from week 13 but respond differently to ZIKV in terms
of neuronogenesis. On the other hand, both K054 and
K048 showed significant reduction in the number of differ-
entiated neurons despite being derived from different
developmental stages. Third, the cell-strain-dependent
impairment of neuronal differentiation is unlikely due
to the long-term culture (passage 22) of hNSCs. Previous
studies indicate that some hNSC strains, when cultured
long-term in vitro, extensively accumulate chromosomal
7 and 19 trisomy that may affect neuronal differentiation
(Sareen et al., 2009). However, our cytogenetic analyses
identified only minimal if any chromosomal trisomy in
all cell strains. Finally, the cell-strain-dependent neuronal
deficit is unlikely attributed to ZIKV-induced apoptosis.
This is because that K054 cells, although having a higher
apoptotic death rate than K048, showed a smaller reduc-
tion of neurons than K048. Furthermore, the low rates
(<1.7%) of apoptotic cell death in K048 and K054 do not
match the magnitude of neuronal reduction (>33%) caused
by ZIKV infection.
Interestingly, this cell-strain-dependent neuronal impair-
ment seems well correlated with the ZIKV-induced alter-
ation of global gene expression pattern; i.e., K054 and
K048 share similar changes in transcriptome and neuronal
phenotype that are distinct from G010. It remains to
be determined what gene(s) is/are responsible for ZIKV-
induced and cell-strain-dependent reduction of neuronal
differentiation. One of the most obvious differences de-
tected by transcriptome analyses is that K054 and K048

 but not G010 share similar patterns in the innate immune
response, including interferons, cytokines, and comple-
ments. A recent study also shows that cranial neural crest
cells produce cytokines associated with decreased neuro-
genesis following infection with either MR-766 or H/PF/
2013 ZIKV strains (Bayless et al., 2016). In addition, the
findings related to downregulation of the Histone 1 gene
family in K048 and K054 but not G010 also warrant
further investigation due to the broad implications of his-
tone modifications. Further studies with additional hNSC
strains and ZIKV viral strains are required to investigate
the correlation of these findings and the underlying mech-
anisms as to how different genetic backgrounds contribute
to the cell-strain-dependent neuronal deficits following
ZIKV infection.
Another important discovery of our study is that
following 2 weeks of differentiation, Mex1-7 infection
was mainly found in glial cells. This was true for all three
cell strains. Possible explanations include that: (1) ZIKV
does not interfere with astroglial differentiation from in-
fected hNSCs; (2) hNSC-differentiated astroglia survive
better than neurons; and (3) free virions released from
the original target cells preferentially infect glial cells
upon their differentiation. Studies to evaluate various
infection time points during differentiation and to include
other
ZIKV
strains
are
needed
to
investigate
these
hypotheses.
In summary, we demonstrate that the Asian-lineage ZIKV
2015 Mexican strain, Mex1-7, is neurotropic to human
fetal brain-derived NSCs. It halts hNSC proliferation inde-
pendent of human donor origin but elicits impairment of
neuronal differentiation and alters the global gene expres-
sion pattern in a cell-strain-dependent manner. The pri-
mary hNSC culture system allows quantitative analyses of
ZIKV affecting various perspectives of neural development,
which lays a foundation for mechanistic investigation of
ZIKV neuropathology and for therapeutic development.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
ZIKV Isolation and Culture
ZIKV Mex1-7 was isolated from an A. aegypti pool of mosquitoes
collected in late 2015 in Mexico on a monolayer of Vero cells, an
African green monkey kidney cell line. This virus was amplified
33 in Vero cell cultures prior to use and titrated on Vero cell mono-
layers as previously described (Rossi et al., 2016). Other ZIKV
strains include FSS (2010 human isolate from Cambodia, Asian
lineage) and DakAr (1984 mosquito isolate from Senegal, African
lineage). FSS was passaged once in AP-1 cells, once in C6/36 mos-
quito cells, and five times in Vero cells. DakAR was passaged five
times in Vero cells, once in C6/36 cells and another two times in
Vero cells prior to use. All viruses were amplified to high titers
with the final passage in Vero cells (Rossi et al., 2016).
Human Neural Stem Cell Culture and Proliferation
The G010, K048, and K054 strains of primary hNSCs, originally
derived from the cortex of 9-week-old (K048) and 13-week-old
(K054 and G010) human male fetuses, were propagated in vitro
as described previously (Tarasenko et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2002).
Cells were grown as neurospheres in DMEM/F12 basic medium
supplemented with 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF),
20 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 2, 10 ng/mL leukemia inhibitor
factor (LIF), and N2; and passaged every 10 days. Reagents were
purchased from Invitrogen, Sigma-Aldrich, R&D Systems, or Fisher
Scientific. All three cell strains were used at passage number 22.
Cytogenetic analyses to determine chromosomal properties of
these hNSC strains were performed by FISH. For details on FISH,
see Supplemental Information.
ZIKV Infection
Three strains of ZIKV were used in this study, including Mex1-7
(2015 isolate in Mexico, Asian lineage), FSS (2010 human isolate
from Cambodia, Asian lineage), and DakAr (1984 mosquito isolate
from Senegal, African lineage). Primary hNSCs were infected for
1 hr in suspension with an MOI from 1 to 10 initially and then
10 for all experiments described here. Following ZIKV inoculation,
cells were either kept in proliferation media or subjected to differ-
entiation. Following infection, cells were pelleted by centrifuga-
tion and resuspended in the appropriate media, and then seeded
into 24-well plates pre-coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin to
facilitate adherence. To determine the effect of ZIKV infection on
cell proliferation, uninfected or ZIKV-inoculated G010, K054,
and K048 cells were seeded at the density of 1 million cells/flask
into uncoated T-25 flasks to maintain cells in 3D free-floating
spheres. Eleven days after infection, cells were dissociated and
numbers counted.
Differentiation of Human Neural Stem Cells after ZIKV
Infection
Dissociated hNSCs were plated into T25 flasks after Mex1-7 inocu-
lation. After a 2-day incubation, 8 3 104 hNSCs (small spheres)
were seeded into 24-well plates pre-coated with 0.01% poly-D-
lysine and 1 mg/cm2 laminin (Invitrogen/Gibco) and incubated
for 4 days with priming medium containing EGF (20 ng/mL),
LIF (10 ng/mL), and laminin (1 mg/mL), followed by 9 days incu-
bation with a differentiation medium consisting of N2 plus
glutathione (1 mg/mL) (Sigma), biotin (0.1 mg/mL) (Sigma), super-
oxide dismutase (2.5 mg/mL) (Worthington), DL-a-tocopherol
(1 mg/mL) (Sigma), DL-a-tocopherol acetate (1 mg/mL) (Sigma),
and catalase (Sigma).
BrdU Labeling
BrdU was acquired from Sigma (catalog no. B9285-16) and pre-
pared in a natural saline solution of 0.9% sodium chloride (Sigma).
BrdU was added to the cells 7 dpi at a concentration of 10 mM for
4 hr. Following 4 hr of BrdU pulse labeling, cells were fixed with
cold 4% paraformaldehyde and post fixed with cold methanol. An-
tigen unmasking was performed by adding 2 N hydrochloric acid
to each well, then neutralizing with borate buffer. Cells were
then blocked with 5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% BSA for
1 hr. Primary sheep antibody for BrdU (catalog no. ab1893) and
724
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 8 j 715–727 j March 14, 2017
 secondary antibody donkey anti-sheep 568 (catalog no. A-21099)
was used to stain and visualize BrdU.
Immunocytochemistry
Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies and then fluo-
rophore-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the proced-
ure described previously (Jordan et al., 2009). Particularly, ZIKV
viral foci were detected by immunostaining using a polyclonal
mouse hyperimmune ascites fluid (MHIAF) generated against
ZIKV diluted 1:2,000 (Walker et al., 2015; Vasilakis et al., 2008).
The MHIAF was obtained from the World Reference Collection
for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas
Medical Branch. Primary antibodies against MAP2 (Millipore,
no. AB5622) and GFAP (Sigma, no. G9269) were used to stain for
neurons and astroglia, respectively. Anti-active Cas3 antibody
(Abcam, no. ab2303) was used to identify apoptotic cells. Anti-
BrdU (Abcam, no. ab1893) and anti-Ki-67 antibodies (Abcam, no.
ab15580) were used to determine proliferation. Nuclear marker,
DAPI, was used to stain cell nuclei. Images were taken using a
Nikon epifluorescent microscope.
RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR Analyses
An RNAqueous total RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher, no.
AM1912) was used to extract total RNA from 1 day-differentiated
hNSCs (or 5 days after ZIKV infection) in each of the three hNSC
strains in independent triplicates, as recommended by the manu-
facturer. Uninfected cells served as controls. Total RNA (�1 mg)
was used for library construction for each of the three replicates
of the control and infected cells. First- and second-strand synthe-
sis, adapter ligation, and amplification of the library were per-
formed using the Illumina TruSeq v2 RNA Sample Preparation
kit under conditions prescribed by the manufacturer (Illumina).
Samples were tracked using ‘‘index tags’’ incorporated into the
adapters. Library quality was evaluated using an Agilent DNA-
1000 chip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Quantification of li-
brary DNA templates was performed using qPCR and a reference
standard of known size. Cluster formation of the library DNA tem-
plates was performed using the TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 (Illumina)
and the Illumina cBot workstation using conditions recommended
by the manufacturer. Template input was adjusted to obtain a clus-
ter density of 700–900 K/mm2. Paired-end 50 base sequencing by
synthesis was performed using a TruSeq SBS Kit v3 (Illumina) on
an Illumina HiSeq 1500 using the manufacturer’s protocols.
Reads were aligned to the human GRCh38 reference genome us-
ing STAR, an ultrafast splicing aware alignment program, version
2.5.1b (Dobin et al., 2013). Gene expression levels were quantified
with the cuffquant function of the Cufflinks software (Trapnell
et al., 2012), version 2.2.1, using the UCSC annotation file from
the iGenomes website (Illumina). Differential expression analysis
was performed with the Cufflinks function cuffdiff, using the
default parameters, with the significance cutoff set to an FDR
of <0.05. Hallmark pathways were identified using gene set enrich-
ment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005; Mootha et al., 2003), with
genes that were upregulated more than 2-fold (781) or 4-fold (312),
or downregulated more than 2-fold (448).
RNA-seq results were further validated by qRT-PCR on specific
target genes. Duplicate CT values were analyzed in Microsoft Excel
by using the comparative CT(DDCT) method as described by
the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Values of FAS, SOX1,
and TUBB3 products (2�DDCT) were normalized to the endogenous
reference (18S rRNA) and then to a calibrator (one of the experi-
mental samples). For details on qRT-PCR primer design and
running conditions, see Supplemental Information.
Statistical Analyses
Experiments were performed in independent triplicate infec-
tions. For immunocytochemical analysis, 10–17 randomly cho-
sen fields per sample were counted blindly from triplicate exper-
iments by three independent investigators. Data were quantified
using Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s least sig-
nificant difference test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
