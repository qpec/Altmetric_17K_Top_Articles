Purpose
Expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a potential predictive marker for response and
outcome after treatment with anti–programmed death 1 (PD-1). This study explored the relationship
between anti–PD-1 activity and PD-L1 expression in patients with advanced melanoma who were
treated with pembrolizumab in the phase Ib KEYNOTE-001 study (clinical trial information:
NCT01295827).
Patients and Methods
Six hundred fifty-five patients received pembrolizumab10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks or once every
3 weeks, or 2 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. Tumor response was assessed every 12 weeks per
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by independent central review. Primary
outcome was objective response rate. Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS). Membranous PD-L1 expression in tumor and tumor-associated
immune cells was assessed by a clinical trial immunohistochemistry assay (22C3 antibody) and
scored on a unique melanoma (MEL) scale of 0 to 5 by one of three pathologists who were blinded to
clinical outcome; a score $ 2 (membranous staining in $ 1% of cells) was considered positive.
Results
Of 451 patients with evaluable PD-L1 expression, 344 (76%) had PD-L1–positive tumors. De-
mographic and staging variables were equally distributed among PD-L1–positive and –negative
patients. An association between higher MEL score and higher response rate and longer PFS (hazard
ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.82) and OS (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.83) was observed
(P , .001 for each). Objective response rate was 8%, 12%, 22%, 43%, 57%, and 53% for MEL 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
Conclusion
PD-L1 expression in pretreatment tumor biopsy samples was correlated with response rate, PFS,
and OS; however, patients with PD-L1–negative tumors may also achieve durable responses.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer cells can exploit many pathways to evade
the immune system.1 One such mechanism in-
volves the exploitation of endogenous inhibitory
checkpoints that serve to terminate the immune
response after antigen activation.2-4 Antibodies
against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated pro-
tein 4, such as ipilimumab, release one such
negative regulatory pathway,5 which results in
a survival benefit in patients with metastatic
melanoma.6,7 Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is
another key immune inhibitory checkpoint. The
PD-1 pathway is a powerful regulator of pe-
ripheral tolerance. Initially described in 1992,8
PD-1 is preferentially expressed by activated
T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells in the setting of
chronic antigen exposure.9 Two ligands for PD-1
have been identified to date: programmed death-
ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-ligand
2. PD-L1 was first described in 200010 and is
widely expressed by myeloid and lymphoid tissues
as well as in nonlymphoid tissues, such as the

 lung, heart, pancreas, and placenta.11 In the tumor microenvi-
ronment, PD-L1 is known to be induced by types I and II in-
terferon. Both tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating cells of multiple
cancers have been shown to express PD-L1.12-15
Recent clinical trials that assessed monoclonal antibodies
against PD-1 and PD-L1 have shown that these therapies pro-
vide antitumor activity against diverse tumor histologies. Pem-
brolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal
antibody against PD-1, has been assessed in multiple clinical trials
and has demonstrated antitumor activity and a manageable safety
profile in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignan-
cies.16-27 Although these data highlight the effectiveness of PD-1
pathway inhibition, it is clear that most patients, even those with
prototypically immunogenic tumors, such as melanoma, will not
achieve objective responses. Currently, the best marker of response
to anti–PD-1 and anti–PD-L1 antibodies is the presence of PD-L1
in tumor cells or tumor-associated stromal cells.14,15,28 Despite the
availability of preliminary evidence that supports the use of PD-L1
as a biomarker, published correlative data remain scarce. Here, we
report on the relationship between anti–PD-1 activity and PD-L1
expression in patients with advanced melanoma who were treated
with pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE-001 clinical trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Conduct
KEYNOTE-001, an international, multicohort, open-label, phase I
study that assessed the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients
with advanced melanoma, was sponsored by Merck & Co (Kenilworth,
NJ). The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, Good
Clinical Practice standards, and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol
and its amendments were approved by the relevant institutional review
boards or ethics committees of the participating institutions. All patients
provided written informed consent to participate. The study was registered
with ClinicalTrials.gov.
As described previously,24 patients with ipilimumab-naive, ipilimumab-
treated, or ipilimumab-refractory melanoma were enrolled in non–randomly
assigned and randomly assigned cohorts and were treated with pem-
brolizumab 2 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, or
10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks. Regardless of dose or schedule, pembrolizumab
was administered intravenously over a 30-minute period on day one of each
cycle and continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal
of consent, or investigator decision.
Patient Eligibility
Detailed eligibility criteria have been published previously.16,17 In
brief, enrolled patients were $ 18 years of age with advanced unresectable
melanoma, had measurable disease per investigator assessment, an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate
organ function. Previous systemic therapy was limited to two or fewer
regimens for patients with ipilimumab-naive disease and was unlimited for
patients who were previously treated with ipilimumab. A new tumor
biopsy sample collected within 60 days of the first pembrolizumab dose
was required. Key exclusion criteria included active autoimmune disease,
systemic corticosteroid therapy (except for managing ipilimumab-related
adverse events in patients with ipilimumab-refractory disease), and pre-
vious treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. There was no protocol
requirement for baseline magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, but
patients with previously treated brain metastases could enroll if they were
clinically stable for $ 8 weeks. A later protocol amendment permitted
patients with brain metastases who were stable for $ 4 weeks to enroll.
Assessments
Tumor response was assessed every 12 weeks per RECIST v1.129 by
independent central review and per immune-related response criteria30 by
investigator review. Pembrolizumab treatment decisions were made on the
basis of immune-related response criteria. The primary end point was the

PD-L1 Expression and Response in Melanoma
 objective response rate (ORR) assessed per RECIST v1.1 by central review.
Secondary end points included response duration (time from first docu-
mentation of response to first documentation of disease progression),
progression-free survival (PFS; time from start of treatment to docu-
mentation of disease progression or death as a result of any cause), and
overall survival (OS; time from start of treatment to death as a result of
any cause).
PD-L1 expression was assessed in pretreatment tumor biopsy samples
by using an investigational version of an immunohistochemistry assay,
which is now commercially available (PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx; Dako
North America, Carpinteria, CA) and approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for use in non–small-cell lung cancer. All samples were
obtained within 60 days of the first pembrolizumab dose and were analyzed
either internally at Dako North America (n = 195; 30%) or at Labcorp
Clinical Trials (Los Angeles, CA; n = 460; 70%). Each sample was scored by
one of three pathologists who were blinded to clinical outcome. Examples
of stained samples are shown in Fig 1.
Melanoma samples were scored on the MEL 0 to 5 scale, which was
derived from a scheme commonly used for hormone receptors in breast
cancer.31 The MEL score was described using the hormone receptor
terminology of the Allred proportion score in the European Union
pembrolizumab label. However, we abandoned that terminology herein to
avoid confusion, because, other than the 0 to 5 scale, PD-L1 scoring for
melanoma differs considerably from scoring hormone receptors. Of note,
PD-L1 scoring is distinct from that used for non–small-cell lung cancer.
Table 1 lists the correspondence between the MEL 0 to 5 scores and the
percentage of stained cells. Cells scored include tumor cells themselves as
well as mononuclear inflammatory cells, which are intercalated within or

 are contiguous with tumor nests. Inflammatory cells within the stroma,
distinct from the tumor nests, are excluded from scoring. MEL scores of
0 or 1, corresponding to , 1% staining, are considered to be negative,
whereas scores of 2 to 5, corresponding to $ 1% staining, are considered
positive. The positive and negative interpretation is based on receiver
operating characteristic analysis, which favored the true-positive rate—and,
thus, negative predictive value—at the expense of the false-positive rate.
Statistical Analyses
ORR was assessed in all patients with evaluable PD-L1 expression
who received one or more doses of study treatment and had measurable
disease per RECIST v1.1 by central review. ORR and its associated 95% CI
was estimated by using the exact binomial method. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to estimate time-to-event outcomes, including PFS,
duration of response, and OS, in all patients with evaluable PD-L1 ex-
pression who received one or more doses of study treatment. The re-
lationship between tumor PD-L1 positivity and ORR was explored by
using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.32 The relationship between
ORR and PD-L1 expression via the MEL score was explored by using
logistic regression analysis. The relationships between tumor PD-L1 ex-
pression and PFS and OS were explored by Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis. All analyses were performed using a data cutoff date of
October 18, 2014.
RESULTS
Study Design and Patient Characteristics
Between December 2011 and September 2013, 655 patients
with advanced melanoma were enrolled in KEYNOTE-001 (Ap-
pendix Fig A1, online only). Among these 655 patients, biopsy
samples from 451 patients that were collected in the 60 days before
the first dose of pembrolizumab was administered were evaluable
for PD-L1 expression. Of 451 evaluable patients, 344 (76%) had
PD-L1–positive tumors and 107 (24%) had PD-L1–negative

PD-L1 Expression and Response in Melanoma
 tumors. Patient baseline demographics and disease characteristics
were mostly similar between patients with PD-L1–positive and
those with PD-L1–negative tumors, with the exception of higher
percentages of BRAF wild-type tumors and ipilimumab treatment
in patients with PD-L1–positive tumors (Table 2). A breakdown of
key baseline characteristics by MEL score is presented in Appendix
Table A1 (online only).
Relationship Between PD-L1 Expression and Efficacy
The confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 by independent central
review was 33% (95% CI, 28% to 37%) in 405 patients who were
evaluable for both PD-L1 expression and tumor response. An
association between a higher MEL score for PD-L1 expression and
ORR was observed (P , .001; Fig 2; panel A). The highest and
lowest ORRs were observed in patients with tumors with a MEL
score of 4 (ORR, 57%) and 0 (ORR, 8%). The pattern of change in
tumor size compared with baseline seemed to vary by MEL score
(Fig 3). Among evaluable patients at week 12, 35%, 38%, 57%,
78%, 84%, and 86% showed reductions from baseline tumor
measurements for MEL scores 0 to 5, respectively. Of note, patients
with MEL scores of 4 or 5, 33% and 22%, respectively, showed
a reduction of $ 50% at week 12. Qualitatively, patients with MEL
scores of 0 or 1 were less likely to have a decrease from baseline
tumor size overall, whereas more patients with MEL scores of 2 to 5
had a 100% decrease from baseline.
In 451 patients who were evaluable for PD-L1 expression,
associations between a higher MEL score and the 9-month PFS and
12-month OS rates were observed (Fig 2; panels B and C). Similar
to ORR, patients with tumors with a MEL score of 4 had the best
outcomes in terms of survival, whereas a similar proportion of
patients with tumors with MEL scores of 4 and 5 were alive and free
of progression at 9 months. Associations between higher PD-L1
MEL score and PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.82;
P , .001) and OS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.83; P , .001) were
observed. Similarly, significant associations were also observed
when PD-L1 expression was categorized as positive (ie, MEL score
2 to 5) or negative (ie, MEL score 0 or 1; Fig 4), with a HR of 0.51
(95% CI, 0.40 to 0.65) and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.67) for PFS and
OS, respectively.
DISCUSSION
PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are rapidly emerging as a central
therapeutic modality for patients with advanced melanoma.
Results of recent clinical trials have shown the superiority of
pembrolizumab over chemotherapy for patients with ipilimumab-
refractory melanoma and, if BRAFV600 mutant, a BRAF in-
hibitor;25 of pembrolizumab over ipilimumab for patients with
ipilimumab-naive melanoma;26 of nivolumab over chemotherapy
as first-line therapy;33 and of nivolumab alone or combined with
ipilimumab over ipilimumab as first-line therapy.34 Anti–PD-1 and
anti–PD-L1 antibodies are also widely active across diverse non-
melanoma cancers.16-27 Given the targeted nature of these anti-
bodies, it seems logical that PD-L1 expression should be correlated
with outcome; however, the data that have emerged so far are
complex and ambiguous. Whereas PD-L1 expression seems to
correlate with response, the thresholds required for response vary
widely by both tumor histology and immunohistochemistry
method used.14,15 PD-L1 assays that incorporate different cut
points to define PD-L1 positivity also pose a challenge for in-
terpretation.35 The variability of tumor PD-L1 status according to
assay and cut point used is illustrated by the PD-L1 positivity rates
observed in similar advanced melanoma populations in the current
study (76.3%) and in a recent randomized trial of ipilimumab plus
nivolumab versus each agent alone in patients with treatment-
naive melanoma (23.6%).34 Along with differences in assays and
antibodies, use of newly collected versus archival tumor samples
may impact the rate of PD-L1 positivity.31 Furthermore, PD-L1
expression is dynamic and is affected by many factors, including
prior therapy and presence of tumor-infiltrating immune cells,34
which may limit its ability to discriminate between patients who
will and will not respond to therapy. Physicians should be made
aware of the various antibodies and assays in use, including their
differences and their limitations. Of note, the clinical use of the
assay described here may be less uniform in practice than readings
done by more experienced pathologists. Nonetheless, tumor
PD-L1 expression remains of predictive value.36,37 One of the critical
unanswered questions is whether PD-L1 expression is correlated
with survival, which remains the gold standard for therapeutic
intervention. Other correlative markers, such as CD8+ T-cell in-
filtration of the tumor or of the tumor margin, have also been
studied.36 Whereas these are promising biomarker candidates,

 there are currently few prospective data that assess their po-
tential use.
To our knowledge, the data described here represent one of the
most comprehensive analyses of the relationship between PD-L1
expression and treatment outcome presented to date for any tu-
mor. KEYNOTE-001 was a large phase I trial, with 655 patients
enrolled in the melanoma arms. Of these 655 patients, 451 patients
had tumor samples that were evaluable for PD-L1 expression by
using the 22C3 antibody. Clinical outcomes in KEYNOTE-001
were measured rigorously, with radiologic response to therapy
evaluated per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review. Using
this robust dataset, a relationship was observed between PD-L1
expression assessed by using a unique MEL scoring system and
ORR. The highest ORR was observed among patients with an MEL
score of 4. Of most importance, survival was also correlated with
PD-L1 expression. Reflective of the significance of PD-L1 ex-
pression, Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS diverged when PD-
L1 expression was categorized as positive (ie, MEL score 2 to 5) and
negative (ie, MEL score 0 or 1).
Given the data described here, PD-L1 expression is correlated
with clinical outcome in patients with advanced melanoma.
Whereas there is some uncertainty regarding the optimal level of
PD-L1 expression, a level that corresponds to MEL scores of 3 to 5
seems to best capture the population that is most highly responsive

PD-L1 Expression and Response in Melanoma
 to PD-1 blockade. Conversely, MEL scores of 0 or 1 represents the
least responsive population, and a MEL score of 2, which represents
the largest proportion of patients (29%), seems to be intermediate,
with many patients experiencing a response to therapy. Further-
more, tumors with the highest levels of PD-L1 staining exhibited
deeper responses (33% and 22% of patients showed reductions
of $ 50% at week 12 with MEL scores of 4 and 5, respectively).
Although there was no clear evidence of differences between MEL
score and age or sex, there did seem to be some evidence of in-
creased PD-L1 positivity with prior ipilimumab treatment; how-
ever, it is not clear that this relationship is reproducible in other
studies, as PD-L1 expression—using the same assay and scoring
guidelines—was observed in 81% of ipiliumab-naive patients in
KEYNOTE-006.26
Randomized controlled studies are needed to better un-
derstand the clinical benefits of pembrolizumab in patients with
PD-L1–positive and PD-L1–negative melanoma, particularly given
that a proportion of patients who have PD-L1–negative tumors
may experience a durable response with pembrolizumab. Of note,
both intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of PD-L1
expression have been observed,37,38 as have changes in PD-L1
expression over time.13,39 Therefore, analysis of a single tissue
sample, as in this study, may result in the classification of a tumor
with some PD-L1–positive areas as PD-L1 negative. Further
limitations of this analysis are that the study included non–
randomly assigned cohorts, and a sizeable fraction (31%) of the
overall study population was not evaluable for PD-L1 expression.
Important questions remain regarding the relationship be-
tween PD-L1 expression and the therapeutic effects of anti–PD-1
and anti–PD-L1 antibodies. It is clear that even with a MEL score of
0 in the assay used in this study, durable responses were still
observed; response rates were even higher in the other MEL score
groups. The high prevalence of PD-L1 positivity observed in this
study, along with the durable responses observed in PD-L1–
negative tumors, suggest that pembrolizumab treatment should
not be limited to patients with PD-L1–positive tumors. Ongoing
clinical trials with correlative studies will further delineate the role
of PD-L1 expression in melanoma.
