Objective Dna-based testing of pancreatic cyst fluid 
(PcF) is a useful adjunct to the evaluation of pancreatic 
cysts (Pcs). Mutations in KRAS/GNAS are highly 
specific for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms 
(iPMns) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (Mcns), while 
TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN alterations are associated with 
advanced neoplasia. a prospective study was performed 
to evaluate preoperative PcF Dna testing.
Design Over 43-months, 626 PcF specimens from 
595 patients were obtained by endoscopic ultrasound 
(eUS)-fine needle aspiration and assessed by targeted 
next-generation sequencing (ngS). Molecular results 
were correlated with eUS findings, ancillary studies and 
follow-up. a separate cohort of 159 PcF specimens was 
also evaluated for KRAS/GNAS mutations by Sanger 
sequencing.
results KRAS/GNAS mutations were identified in 308 
(49%) Pcs, while alterations in TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN were 
present in 35 (6%) cases. Based on 102 (17%) patients 
with surgical follow-up, KRAS/GNAS mutations were 
detected in 56 (100%) iPMns and 3 (30%) Mcns, and 
associated with 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity for 
a mucinous Pc. in comparison, KRAS/GNAS mutations 
by Sanger sequencing had a 65% sensitivity and 100% 
specificity. By ngS, the combination of KRAS/GNAS 
mutations and alterations in TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN had 
an 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity for advanced 
neoplasia. Ductal dilatation, a mural nodule and 
malignant cytopathology had lower sensitivities (42%, 
32% and 32%, respectively) and specificities (74%, 94% 
and 98%, respectively).
Conclusions in contrast to Sanger sequencing, 
preoperative ngS of PcF for KRAS/GNAS mutations is 
highly sensitive for iPMns and specific for mucinous 
Pcs. in addition, the combination of TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN 
alterations is a useful preoperative marker for advanced 
neoplasia.
InTrODuCTIOn
The frequent detection of a pancreatic cyst (PC) 
by abdominal imaging has created a diagnostic 
and treatment dilemma. PCs represent a broad and 
diverse group of lesions that range from benign to 
malignant entities. For example, pseudocysts and 
serous cystadenomas (SCAs) do not have malig-
nant potential and can be monitored clinically, 
whereas mucinous PCs, such as intraductal papil-
lary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and mucinous 
cystic neoplasms (MCNs), can progress to invasive 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.1 2 However, 
distinguishing one cyst from another can be chal-
lenging on the basis of standard clinical findings, 
imaging parameters and ancillary fluid studies.3 
Moreover, the rate of progression of mucinous 
PCs into malignancy is low and difficult to predict. 
Weighing the risks of cancer development with the 
risks of surgical intervention, both consensus-based 
and evidence-based guidelines were developed to 
aid in the appropriate surveillance and treatment of 
PCs.4 5 While these guidelines represent an extrap-
olation of current data, several studies have found 
them to be imperfect.6–8 Hence, the management of 
PCs is often an individualised approach.
Recently, DNA-based testing has emerged as an 
adjunct to the assessment of PCs.9 Although cellular 
content and fluid volume of PC aspirates are often 
suboptimal for routine ancillary studies, such as 
cytopathology 
and 
carcinoembryonic 
antigen 
(CEA) quantitation, DNA from lysed or exfoliated 
cyst epithelial lining shed into the pancreatic cyst 
fluid (PCF) can be analysed for genetic abnormal-
ities.10 11 Furthermore, sequencing studies have 
identified distinct mutational profiles of the major 
PCs as well as those that have progressed to invasive 
adenocarcinoma.12–14 For example, mutations in 
KRAS are commonly detected in IPMNs and MCNs 
and the presence of GNAS mutations is highly 
specific for IPMNs.15–17 In contrast, VHL mutations 
and/or deletions are characteristic of SCAs and 
CTNNB1 mutations in the absence of other genetic 
alterations are observed in solid-pseudopapillary 
neoplasms.13 Additionally, IPMNs with advanced 
neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia and invasive adeno-
carcinoma) are reported to harbour mutations in 
TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN and/or AKT1.18–23 While 
several studies have evaluated DNA testing of PCs, 
they have largely been retrospective in design, using 
postoperative specimens, limited in sample size and/

significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
 
► DNA-based testing has emerged as an adjunct to the 
assessment of pancreatic cysts (PCs).
 
► Although cellular content and fluid volume of PC aspirates 
are commonly suboptimal for routine ancillary studies, 
such as cytopathology and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 
quantitation, DNA from lysed or exfoliated cyst epithelial 
lining shed into the PC fluid can be analysed for genetic 
abnormalities.
 
► Several studies have evaluated DNA-based testing of PCs, 
but they have largely been retrospective in design, using 
postoperative specimens, limited in sample size, lack 
adequate follow-up and/or suffer from insensitive detection 
strategies.
What are the new findings?
 
► We have prospectively evaluated preoperative DNA-based 
testing of PC fluid within a large cohort and found mutations 
in KRAS and/or GNAS by next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
are highly sensitive and specific for intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), but not mucinous cystic 
neoplasms (MCNs).
 
► The sensitivity of preoperative DNA-based testing for IPMNs 
and MCNs was lower with Sanger sequencing than NGS.
 
► The preoperative detection of mutations/deletions in 
TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN with mutant allele frequencies 
(MAFs) that are equivalent to MAFs for KRAS and/or GNAS 
mutations was highly sensitive and specific for IPMNs with 
advanced neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia and invasive 
adenocarcinoma).
 
► Low-level mutations in TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN 
were detected in IPMNs with low-grade dysplasia and 
may represent a subset of IPMNs at risk for malignant 
transformation.
 
► MAFs for GNAS mutations >55% correlated with IPMNs with 
high-grade dysplasia.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable 
future?
 
► These results definitively highlight the usage of preoperative 
NGS in accurately classifying PCs and the detection of IPMNs 
harbouring advanced neoplasia.
or lack adequate follow-up.12 14 24 25 Thus, the diagnostic usage of 
DNA analysis of PCF in routine clinical practice remains unclear.
In this study, we developed a highly sensitive, targeted 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for genes known to be 
frequently mutated and/or deleted in PCs and PCs with advanced 
neoplasia (KRAS, GNAS, NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, TP53, 
PIK3CA, PTEN and AKT1). Due to technical issues, we were 
unable to include VHL within this panel, but assessed the entire 
coding sequence of VHL by Sanger sequencing with the under-
standing that the sensitivity of Sanger sequencing is known to 
be lower than NGS.26 This test was performed within a Clin-
ical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified and 
College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited clinical labo-
ratory using PCF obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle 
aspiration (EUS-FNA) for the routine assessment of PCs. Our 
objectives were to prospectively evaluate DNA-based molecular 
testing on a large, consecutive cohort of patients to (1) identify 
the prevalence and distribution of genetic alterations within PCs; 
(2) determine the accuracy of molecular analysis using both NGS 
and Sanger sequencing and (3) based on follow-up diagnostic 
surgical pathology compare these findings with other accepted 
diagnostic modalities in the preoperative assessment of PCs.
MATerIAls AnD MeTHODs
Cases
Study approval was obtained from the University of Pittsburgh 
Institutional Review Board (IRB# PRO13020493). Between 
January 2014 and July 2017, 673 PCF specimens obtained by 
EUS-FNA were prospectively submitted to the Molecular & 
Genomic Pathology Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Centre (UPMC) for molecular testing. In all cases, the 
indication for PCF molecular testing was a clinical concern for 
a mucinous PC. Medical records were reviewed to document 
patient demographics, clinical presentation, EUS findings, 
fluid viscosity (as noted by the endoscopist), CEA analysis and 
cytopathological diagnoses. Endoscopic criterion of main duct 
dilatation was defined by a diameter ≥5 
mm.4 In addition, the 
presence of a mural nodule was defined as a uniform echo-
genic nodule of any size without a lucent centre or hyperechoic 
rim.27 A value >192 
ng/mL was used as a cut-off for an elevated 
PCF CEA. For cytopathology specimens, specimen adequacy was 
assessed in all cases using a three-tiered system: satisfactory, less 
than optimal and unsatisfactory. Satisfactory was defined as the 
presence of sufficient epithelial cells and/or mucin representative 
of the target cyst. Less than optimal consisted of scant epithelium 
in the absence of mucin, but with at least few histiocytes present. 
Unsatisfactory specimens were virtually acellular and lacked 
mucin. Malignant cytopathology was defined as either at least 
suspicious for adenocarcinoma or positive for adenocarcinoma. 
Pathology slides were reviewed for each surgical specimen and 
diagnoses for all PCs were rendered based on standard histo-
morphological criteria.28 Cases diagnostic for a mucinous PC 
(IPMN and MCN) with high-grade dysplasia or invasive adeno-
carcinoma were interpreted as advanced neoplasia.7 Patholog-
ical staging was performed as outlined by the American Joint 
Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Manual (eighth edition).29
Molecular testing
Molecular testing was performed prospectively as part of clin-
ical care and within a 14-day (mean, 10 days) turnaround 
within the CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited Molecular and & 
Genomic Pathology Laboratory at UPMC at a cost of $750 per 
PCF specimen. Genomic DNA was isolated from PCF obtained 
by EUS-FNA using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid 
Isolation Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) on Compact 
MagNA Pure (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA). Extracted 
DNA was quantitated on the Qubit V
.2.0 Fluorometer using the 
dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mary-
land, USA). Amplification-based targeted NGS (PancreaSeq) was 
performed with primers for genomic regions of interest that 
included KRAS, GNAS, NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, TP53, 
PIK3CA, PTEN and AKT1 with primer sequences and perfor-
mance characteristics as previously described.12 30 Amplicons 
were barcoded, purified and ligated with specific adapters. DNA 
quantity and quality check was performed using the 2200 TapeS-
tation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). The 
Ion One Touch 2 and One Touch ES were used to prepare and 
enrich templates and enable testing via Ion Sphere Particles on 
a semiconductor chip. Massively parallel sequencing was carried 
out on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine Sequencer 
or Ion Proton according to the manufacturer’s instructions

47 patients were unsatisfactory for molecular testing; however, the remaining 601 PCF specimens from 595 patients were satisfactory. Repeat EUS-
FNA and molecular testing was performed for 25 PCs from 25 (of 595) patients. (*) Of note, 1 of 47 PCs with a VHL alteration also harboured a TP53

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Maryland, USA) and anal-
ysed with the Torrent Suite Software V
.3.4.2. Bioinformatic 
data analysis is described further within the  online supple-
mentary material. The limit of detection was 5% mutant allele 
frequency (MAF) at 500× or 3% MAF at 1000× coverage for 
each tested region. The minimal depth of coverage was 500×. 
For each mutation identified, a MAF was calculated based on 
the number of reads of the mutant allele versus the wild-type 
allele and reported as a percentage. Copy number assessment 
was performed as previously described.31 The total depth of 
sequencing coverage at each sequenced region normalised by the 
normal controls was calculated per sequenced case. A decrease 
in sequencing coverage below established cut-offs with simulta-
neous presence of sequence variant at high MAF was considered 
a biallelic inactivation.
The VHL gene was sequenced by Sanger sequencing approach. 
For the detection of a mutation or deletion, DNA was amplified 
with primers flanking VHL exons 1 (5′-GCG AAG ACT ACG 
GAG-3′ and 5′-CCG TGC TAT CGT CCC T-3′), exon 2 (5′-GTT 
TCA CCA CGT TAG CCA-3′ and 5′-TAC AAA TAC ATC ACT 
TCC A-3′) and exon 3 (5′-CTC TTG TTC GTT CCT TGT-3′ 
and 5′-AAG CAA TGG TGC CTA TT-3′). The quality of ampli-
fied PCR product was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. 
Then, bidirectional Sanger sequencing was performed using the 
BigDye Terminator Kit on ABI3730 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, Maryland, USA). The detection of mutations was 
performed with Mutation Surveyor V
.3.01 (SoftGenetics, State 
College, Pennsylvania). The limit of detection was approxi-
mately 10%–20% of mutant alleles present in a background of 
normal DNA. The aforementioned primers include individual 
exon–intron boundaries, and, therefore, allows for detection of 
both deletions and insertions within exons or complete loss of 
an exon by visual inspection of electropherograms. However, 
a limitation of this method is that it does not detect loss of the 
entire VHL gene.
statistical analysis
Differences in mutational status were compared using Fisher 
exact test for dichotomous variables. Sensitivity and specificity 
were calculated using standard 2×2 
contingency tables for cases 
with confirmed diagnostic pathology. All statistical analyses 
were performed using the SPSS Statistical software, V
.23 (IBM, 
Armonk, New York, USA) and statistical significance was defined 
as a p value of <0.05.

Molecular testing and correlative clinicopathological findings
In total, 673 EUS-FNA-obtained PCF specimens from 642 
patients were prospectively analysed for genetic alterations 
over a 43-month time period (figure 1). Among these cases, 
626 (93%) specimens from 595 patients were satisfactory for 
molecular testing (table 1 and online supplementary data). The 
remaining 47 cases were unable to be tested due to insufficient 
DNA for evaluation. For 6 of 595 (1%) patients, two separate 
specimens corresponding to separate PCs were submitted for 
molecular testing. Further, 25 of 595 (4%) patients had repeat 
EUS-FNA and molecular testing of their PC during the study 
period.
Although sufficient for molecular studies, the amount of cyst 
fluid was insufficient for CEA analysis in 174 of 626 (28%) cases. 
In addition, 375 (60%) specimens were either less than optimal 
(n=297, 47%) or unsatisfactory (n=78, 13%) for cytopatholog-
ical diagnosis. The primary reason for specimen inadequacy was 
absent-to-scant cellularity.
The DNA concentration from submitted EUS-FNA-obtained 
PCF specimens ranged between 0.01 and 248 
ng/uL (mean,

ng/uL). Overall, genetic alterations using 
the 11-gene panel were detected in 357 (57%) PCs. NGS revealed 
activating mutations in KRAS, GNAS, BRAF and CTNNB1 in 264 
(42%), 162 (26%), 5 (1%) and 4 (1%) cases, respectively. No 
mutations in HRAS and NRAS were detected. In total, KRAS 
and/or GNAS mutations were identified in 308 (49%) PCs with 
119 (19%) cases harbouring mutations in both genes (online 
supplementary table 2). Multiple KRAS mutations were present 
in 10 specimens and included various combinations of codon 
12, 13 and 61 substitutions. MAFs for KRAS were 3%–55% 
(mean, 24%; median, 24%). Multiple mutations in GNAS were 
detected in three specimens and consisted of substitutions in 
codons 201 and 227. GNAS MAFs were 3%–92% (mean, 28%; 
median, 26%). T
wo PCs had a GNAS MAF of >55%. The MAFs 
for these two cases were 88% and 92%. BRAF and CTNNB1 
MAFs were 24%–46% 
and 6%–46%, respectively. The presence 
of BRAF and CTNNB1 mutations were only seen in the setting 
of a KRAS and/or GNAS mutation. Instead of NGS, exons 1–3 
of VHL were evaluated by Sanger sequencing. VHL mutations 
and/or deletions were identified throughout the gene coding 
sequence in 47 of 626 (8%) PCs.
NGS was also used to assess the status of TP53, PIK3CA, 
PTEN and AKT1 (table 2). Genetic alterations in TP53, PIK3CA, 
PTEN and AKT1 were identified in 24 (4%), 11 (2%), 2 (1%) 
and 1 (1%) PCs, respectively. Overall, TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN 
and AKT1 alterations were present in 35 (6%) cases. For TP53 
and PTEN, genetic alterations consisted of mutations and/or 
deletions throughout the gene coding sequence. Among these 
cases, MAFs for TP53, PTEN and AKT1 were 4%–43%, 11% 
and 8%, respectively. In addition, homozygous deletions in TP53 
and PTEN were detected in 2 (1%) and 1 (1%) cases, respec-
tively. Alterations in PIK3CA corresponded to activating point 
mutations in exon 9 (n=7) and/or exon 20 (n=5) with MAFs 
of 3%–50%.
PCs with alterations in TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN were 
associated with co-mutation(s) in KRAS and/or GNAS mutations 
(p<0.001). However, 3 of 35 PCs that had a TP53 mutation 
(n=2) or PTEN deletion (n=1) were wild type for KRAS and 
GNAS. Among the two TP53 mutant cases, one harboured a 
VHL deletion and the other was negative for genetic alterations. 
No other genetic alterations were detected in the single PC with 
a PTEN deletion.
Follow-up information and correlation with diagnostic 
surgical pathology
Follow-up data were available for 571 of 595 (96%) patients 
and ranged from 1 to 42 months (mean, 27 months; median, 
26 months). Diagnostic pathology was available for 102 of 
595 (17%) patients that underwent surgical resection within 
1–16 months (mean, 4 months; median, 3 months) from initial 
EUS-FNA and molecular testing (online supplementary table 2).

cyst.
the remaining PCs were due to concern for advanced neoplasia 
within a mucinous PC on the basis of the Fukuoka guidelines and 
consideration of molecular testing.7 Mutations in KRAS and/or 
GNAS were preoperatively detected in all 56 IPMNs. In addition, 
KRAS mutations were identified in two MCNs with high-grade 
dysplasia and one MCN with low-grade dysplasia. However, the 
remaining seven MCNs with low-grade dysplasia were KRAS/
GNAS-negative. The MAFs for KRAS and GNAS were 3%–47% 
and 3%–92%, respectively. As previously described, two PCs had 
MAFs of >55%, and both cases corresponded to IPMNs with 
high-grade dysplasia. No mutations in KRAS and/or GNAS were 
found in the non-mucinous PCs within the resection cohort.
VHL alterations were preoperatively seen in two of three 
SCAs. Although Sanger sequencing failed to detect a VHL 
alteration in one SCA by EUS-FNA, repeat testing of the corre-
sponding surgical resection specimen identified the presence of a 
VHL frameshift mutation. No alterations in VHL were observed 
in the remaining mucinous and non-mucinous PCs.
Genetic alterations in TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN were iden-
tified in all 13 IPMNs with adenocarcinoma, 2 IPMNs with high-
grade dysplasia, 3 IPMNs with low-grade dysplasia and 1 MCN 
with low-grade dysplasia (table 3 and online supplementary 
table 3) The MAFs for TP53, PIK3CA and PTEN were 8%–43%, 
3%–50% and 10%, respectively. Except for the one MCN with 
low-grade dysplasia, co-mutations in KRAS and/or GNAS were 
detected in all PCs with alterations in TP53, PIK3CA and/or 
PTEN. Among the 13 IPMNs with adenocarcinoma and 2 IPMN 
with high-grade dysplasia, the MAFs for KRAS and/or GNAS 
were at least equal to MAFs for TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN 
(figure 2). The three IPMNs with low-grade dysplasia had acti-
vating mutations in PIK3CA, but the MAFs for PIK3CA were less 
than the MAFs for KRAS. While no genetic alterations in TP53, 
PIK3CA and/or PTEN were detected in two IPMNs with high-
grade dysplasia, the MAF for GNAS in both cases was >55%. 
The remaining 2 MCNs with high-grade dysplasia, 36 IPMNs 
with low-grade dysplasia, 8 MCNs with low-grade dysplasia and 
non-mucinous PCs were negative for TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN and/
or AKT1 alterations.
Among the remaining 469 patients with follow-up data and 
no diagnostic surgical pathology, 230 (49%) had PCs with KRAS 
and/or GNAS mutations. Fourteen of these 230 (6%) patients 
also had mutations in TP53, PIK3CA and/or AKT1. However, 
the MAFs for TP53, PIK3CA and/or AKT1 (4%–9%) were less 
than MAFs for KRAS and/or GNAS (28%–45%). In addition, 
two patients harboured a PC with a TP53 mutation and MAFs 
of 5%, but wild type for both KRAS and GNAS. One of these 
two TP53 mutant cases also harboured a VHL deletion. None 
of these PCs demonstrated concerning features for advanced 
neoplasia by both imaging (eg, ductal dilatation or the presence 
of a mural nodule) and cytopathology (eg, malignant cytopa-
thology). Moreover, all 16 patients are currently alive and well 
and have not developed pancreatic cancer on follow-up.
As discussed previously, 25 of 595 patients had repeat 
EUS-FNA and molecular testing of their PC (figure 1). Fifteen of 
25 patients harboured a PC with no detectable alterations, while 
the remaining 10 patients had a KRAS and/or GNAS mutant PC. 
Repeat aspiration and molecular testing of all 25 cases continued 
to identify the same KRAS and GNAS genetic status as initial

testing. However, among the 10 KRAS and/or GNAS-mutant 
PCs, 1 case had a TP53 mutation on initial molecular testing 
that was absent on subsequent testing. For this single case, the 
MAFs for KRAS and TP53 were 39% and 4%, respectively. In 
contrast, the subsequent specimen had a KRAS MAF of only 4%. 
A comparison of both the initial and repeat EUS-FNA specimens 
for the remaining six PCs revealed MAFs for KRAS and/or GNAS 
that were essentially the same.
Comparison and combination of molecular testing with other 
diagnostic modalities
Based on 102 cases with follow-up diagnostic pathology, preop-
erative NGS detection of KRAS and/or GNAS mutations had 
100% sensitivity and 96% specificity for an IPMN (table 4). 
Further, mutations in KRAS and/or GNAS mutations had a sensi-
tivity of 89% and a specificity of 100% for both IPMNs and 
MCNs. Increased fluid viscosity and an elevated CEA had lower 
sensitivities (77% and 57%, respectively) and lower specificities 
(89% and 80%, respectively).
In conjunction with KRAS and/or GNAS mutations, alterations 
in TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN had 88% sensitivity and 97% 
specificity for IPMNs with advanced neoplasia. Both the sensi-
tivity and specificity increased to 100% by modifying the selec-
tion criteria to include cases with either GNAS MAFs >55% 
or 
TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN MAFs that were at least equivalent to 
KRAS/GNAS MAFs. In comparison, main pancreatic duct dila-
tation and the presence of a mural nodule on EUS had sensitivi-
ties of 47% and 35%, respectively, and specificities of 74% and 
94%, respectively. A preoperative cytopathological diagnosis of 
at least suspicious for adenocarcinoma was associated with 35% 
sensitivity and 97% specificity.
Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of combining KRAS and/
or GNAS mutations with the presence of TP53, PIK3CA and/or 
PTEN alterations for a mucinous PC with advanced neoplasia 
was 79% and 96%, respectively. Modification of selection 
criteria to include the detection of GNAS mutations with MAFs 
of >55% 
or the MAFs for TP53, PIK3CA, and/or PTEN alter-
ations of either equal or greater to MAFs for KRAS and/or GNAS 
mutations had 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity. A diagnosis 
of at least suspicious for adenocarcinoma on cytopathology had 
32% sensitivity and 98% specificity.
Prospective analysis of KrAs and GnAs testing using sanger 
sequencing
Prior to this study, prospective EUS-FNA PCF testing of KRAS 
and GNAS was performed by Sanger sequencing for 175 PCs 
from 169 patients over a 12-month time period (online supple-
mentary material and supplementary table 3). Among the 175 
PCs, 159 (91%) PCs from 153 patients were satisfactory for 
molecular analysis. In contrast to a prevalence of 49% by NGS, 
Sanger sequencing detected mutations in KRAS and/or GNAS in 
39% of PCs (62 of 159). Among this cohort of 159 PCs, 34 cases 
had diagnostic pathology and included the following mucinous 
PCs: 5 IPMNs with adenocarcinoma, 1 IPMN with high-grade 
dysplasia, 12 IPMNs with low-grade dysplasia and 2 MCNs 
with low-grade dysplasia. By Sanger sequencing, 13 of 18 (72%) 
IPMNs and 0 of 2 (0%) MCNs were found to harbour muta-
tions in KRAS and/or GNAS. Overall, the presence of KRAS and/
or GNAS mutations by Sanger sequencing had a sensitivity and 
specificity of 72% and 100%, respectively, for IPMNs and 65% 
and 100%, respectively, for both IPMNs and MCNs. Among the 
159 PCs tested, 24 cases (8 KRAS/GNAS mutant and 16 KRAS/
GNAS wild type) underwent repeat testing for KRAS and GNAS 
 on 3 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

by NGS. The status of KRAS and GNAS were essentially the same 
by NGS; however, 3 of 16 KRAS/GNAS wild type PCs by Sanger 
sequencing were found to harbour mutations in KRAS (n=3) 
and/or GNAS (n=1) by NGS.
DIsCussIOn
Although several factors should be considered when evaluating 
a patient with a PC, key questions need to be answered before 
continuing further surveillance and treatment. First, what type of 
PC does the patient have? More specifically, given the malignant 
potential of mucinous PCs, is the cyst mucinous or non-muci-
nous? Second, does the mucinous PC harbour malignancy? And, 
lastly, if not, what is the malignant potential of the mucinous PC 
within the patient’s lifetime?
Similar to previous studies using retrospective cohorts and 
postsurgical specimens, our prospective evaluation of preoper-
ative DNA-based PC testing identified mutations in KRAS and/
or GNAS to be 89% sensitive and 100% specific for a mucinous 
PC. Furthermore, the presence of KRAS and/or GNAS mutations 
reached 100% sensitivity for IPMNs, and the presence of GNAS 
mutations was 100% specific for an IPMN. However, KRAS 
mutations were detected in only 30% of MCNs. While muta-
tions in KRAS are common in MCNs, the prevalence of these 
activating mutations is reported to increase with the severity of 
dysplasia.16 17 Jimenez et al identified KRAS mutations in 26% of 
MCNs with low-grade dysplasia and 89% of MCNs with high-
grade dysplasia.32 Among the MCNs within our study cohort, 
KRAS mutations were found in 100% of MCNs with high-
grade dysplasia and 13% of MCNs with low-grade dysplasia. 
Considering the relatively young age of most patients, frequent 
occurrence within the pancreatic body and tail and unknown risk 
of progression to adenocarcinoma, surgical resection is typically 
recommended for patients with MCNs.4 Therefore, the assess-
ment of KRAS alone is inadequate for the detection of MCNs 
and additional markers are needed to improve the sensitivity 
of DNA testing. Of note, one MCN with low-grade dysplasia 
did harbour a PTEN deletion and, in the absence of a KRAS 
mutation, may represent a marker for MCNs. Despite the lack 
of sensitivity for MCNs, the sensitivity and specificity of DNA 
testing for a mucinous PC were higher than surrogate markers 
of mucinous differentiation, such as increased fluid viscosity and 
elevated CEA.
The diagnosis of a mucinous PC is further enhanced by molec-
ular markers to exclude common mimics. Oligocystic and uniloc-
ular variants of SCA are often clinically and radiographically 
indistinguishable from branch duct IPMNs and MCNs. Genetic 
alterations in VHL have been described to be highly specific 
for SCAs, but could potentially be present in cystic PanNETs.33 
Within our study, the specificity of VHL mutations and/or dele-
tions by Sanger sequencing for SCAs was 100%. However, we 
failed to preoperatively identify a VHL alteration in one SCA. 
Repeat testing of the corresponding surgical pathology specimen 
revealed a frameshift mutation in VHL. The inability to detect a 
VHL alteration within the preoperative PCF may be attributed 
to the inherent limitations of Sanger sequencing. Prior to this 
study, we prospectively evaluated KRAS and GNAS mutations 
by Sanger sequencing. In contrast to NGS, Sanger sequencing 
detected KRAS and GNAS mutations in 39% of PCs and had

a sensitivity of 72% for IPMNs. The differences in sensitivity 
between Sanger sequencing and NGS can be explained by the 
detection limit for each assay. The lowest limit of detection for 
Sanger sequencing is approximately 10%–20% of mutant alleles, 
while NGS as described herein is approximately 3%–5% of 
mutant alleles. Within this study, 24% of KRAS mutant cysts and 
22% of GNAS mutant cysts had MAFs of <10%. These findings 
would suggest that Sanger sequencing is insufficient for preop-
erative VHL testing and the prevalence of VHL mutations and/
or deletions within our study cohort is likely to be inaccurate. 
Thus, we would discourage the use of Sanger sequencing when 
evaluating preoperative PCF for molecular alterations.
In addition to accurate cyst classification, PC DNA testing 
has garnered significant interest due to the genetic differences 
between mucinous PCs with low-grade dysplasia and those with 
high-grade dysplasia and invasive adenocarcinoma (advanced 
neoplasia). Alterations in the gene TP53 and those within the 
mTOR pathway have been implicated in the malignant transfor-
mation of mucinous PCs. The combination of KRAS and/or GNAS 
mutations with TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN alterations had 79% 
sensitivity and 96% specificity for a mucinous PC with advanced 
neoplasia. Rosenbaum et al described their experience with 
preoperative NGS testing of 113 PCs with corresponding diag-
nostic pathology available for 38 cases.25 The authors reported 
that DNA mutational analysis was associated with 46% sensi-
tivity and 100% specificity for advanced neoplasia. Although the 
authors did not include PIK3CA and PTEN within their testing 
panel, TP53 was assessed, but only mutated in 17% of cases with 
advanced neoplasia. Herein, we found that 63% of mucinous 
PCs with advanced neoplasia harboured TP53 alterations. While 
both studies used NGS, the depth of coverage for each assay was 
significantly different. Coverage refers to the number of times 
a region is sequenced. The deeper the coverage of a genetic 
target (eg, the more times a region is sequenced), the greater 
the reliability and sensitivity of the sequencing assay. Within our 
study, the minimum depth of coverage for each genetic target 
was 500×. In fact, we routinely achieved over 1000× depth 
of coverage. Rosenbaum et al aimed for a minimum depth of 
coverage of 100× with a median of 200× per target.24 25 Never-
theless, the authors state that MAFs as low as 5% were achieved 
for individual genes.
Reviewing the results of NGS testing from the entire study 
cohort revealed two findings that would improve the sensi-
tivity and specificity for detecting mucinous PCs with advanced 
neoplasia. First, a MAF >55% in GNAS was identified in 
two PCs and corresponded to IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia. 
Activating mutations in KRAS and GNAS are typically hetero-
zygous and the MAF is ≤50% due to masking of mutations 
by contaminating non-neoplastic cells (eg, chronic inflamma-
tion and gastrointestinal contamination). In rare instances, the 
MAF of KRAS mutations is >50% through either deletion of 
the wild-type allele or copy number gain of the mutant allele. 
This phenomenon is known as mutant allele-specific imbalance 
(MASI) and reflects increased dosage of the mutant allele by 
copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity or gene amplification. We 
previously reported KRAS MASI in PCF correlates with muci-
nous PCs with advanced neoplasia.11 To date, GNAS MASI within 
PCF has not been described, but based on our findings it seems 
to be associated with high-grade dysplasia within IPMNs.
A second finding was a MAF for TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN that 
was at least equal to a MAF for KRAS/GNAS correlated with 
the presence of advanced neoplasia within an IPMN. Although 
the combination of KRAS and/or GNAS mutations with genetic 
alterations in TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN were frequently

detected in IPMNs with advanced neoplasia, mutations in 
KRAS/GNAS and PIK3CA were also identified in two IPMNs 
with low-grade dysplasia. Moreover, 10 PCs without diagnostic 
surgical pathology were found to harbour mutations in KRAS/
GNAS and TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN, but lacked concerning features 
for advanced neoplasia by both imaging and cytopathology, and 
have not progressed to malignancy on follow-up. However, 
among these cases, the MAFs for TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN were 
lower than the MAFs for KRAS/GNAS. By modifying the selec-
tion criteria of NGS testing to include a MAF >55% for GNAS 
and a MAF for TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN that is at least equivalent 
to an MAF for KRAS/GNAS, the sensitivity and specificity for 
a mucinous PC with advanced neoplasia was 89% and 100%, 
respectively. In comparison, a cytopathological diagnosis of at 
least suspicious for adenocarcinoma within a mucinous PC was 
associated with 32% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Thus, NGS 
testing seems to outperform other diagnostic modalities in the 
detection of a mucinous PC with high-grade dysplasia and inva-
sive adenocarcinoma.
The presence of TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN alterations 
within IPMNs with low-grade dysplasia and IPMNs are clini-
cally not worrisome is an intriguing observation. The traditional 
thought is mutations in these genes emerge as IPMNs progress 
from low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasive 
adenocarcinoma.1 Recently, Yu et al described their experience 
with NGS of secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice samples.22 Anal-
ogous to our findings, the authors reported that TP53 mutations 
were detected in samples from patients with invasive adenocarci-
noma and a minority of patients with low-grade IPMNs. In addi-
tion, higher concentrations of mutant TP53 were present in cases 
with invasive adenocarcinomas as compared with IPMNs with 
low-grade dysplasia. The authors also described a case where 
a TP53 mutation was identified 1 
year prior to the diagnosis 
of invasive adenocarcinoma and at a time when no worrisome 
features were evident by imaging. While the natural history of 
IPMNs with low-level alterations in TP53, PIK3CA and/or PTEN 
is relatively unknown, it is plausible that these IPMNs are at a 
high risk for progression to malignancy. Considering 49% of PCs 
within our study cohort are likely mucinous PCs with majority 
representing IPMNs, a rational and cost-effective strategy for PC 
surveillance is needed. The identification of KRAS and/or GNAS 
mutations and low-level alterations in TP53, PIK3CA and/or 
PTEN in PCF may represent a predictive marker of malignant 
potential within an IPMN.
This study is, however, not without limitations. Although 
a large number of PCs were analysed, diagnostic surgical 
pathology was available for a small proportion of patients that 
represent a surgical selection bias. Our study also suffers from a 
testing selection bias as PC specimens satisfactory for NGS and 
Sanger sequencing were used for analysis. Considering 7% of 
cases failed molecular testing, the effect of this selection bias on 
our results is likely to be minimal. In addition, the follow-up 
period of this study is relatively short to assess the clinical 
impact of detecting alterations in TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN and/or 
AKT1. The results published herein represent our initial findings 
and we plan to continue monitoring these patients over their 
lifetime. Further, the molecular panel consisted of 11 genes 
commonly altered in PCs and present in invasive adenocarci-
noma, but did not include RNF43, CDKN2A and SMAD4. Muta-
tions and/or deletions in RNF43 have been identified in both 
IPMNs and MCNs, and may improve the sensitivity of detecting 
MCNs.13 However, RNF43 alterations have a prevalence of 8% 
to 35% in MCNs and, therefore, the addition of RNF43 may 
have limited usage in PC testing.22 34 Deletions in CDKN2A 
and SMAD4 are associated with IPMNs harbouring high-grade 
dysplasia and invasive adenocarcinoma.18 22 25 While these genes 
may improve the accuracy of detecting molecular testing, using 
the aforementioned selection criteria to include MAFs for GNAS 
and TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN alterations, the sensitivity and speci-
ficity for advanced neoplasia in an IPMN was 100%, respec-
tively. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to identify a 
minimal set of genes necessary for the assessment of PCs. Lastly, 
this study does not address the optimal approach of integrating 
DNA-based molecular testing to current PC surveillance proto-
cols. Previously, we proposed an algorithmic approach to the 
management of PCs by utilizing molecular testing to stratify 
patients for appropriate management, but this requires further 
validation before implementation.7 Herein, the Fukuoka guide-
lines were applied to the evaluation of mucinous PCs with 
consideration of the impact of molecular testing based on prior 
studies.7 12–14 16 19–23 25
In summary, we report the results of a large, prospective study 
of DNA-based molecular testing of EUS-FNA-obtained preoper-
ative PCF. Overall, our results support the usage of NGS analysis 
in PCF given the high sensitivity and specificity in classifying PCs, 
especially IPMNs, and in the diagnosis of IPMNs with advanced 
neoplasia. Notable limitations of DNA-based molecular testing 
include the assessment of MCNs using KRAS and usage of Sanger 
sequencing in the evaluation of PCs. Future studies are required 
to explore the integration of DNA-based molecular testing into 
current management guidelines.
