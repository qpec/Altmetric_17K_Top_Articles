We evaluate public health and climate impacts of low-sulphur fuels in global shipping. Using
high-resolution emissions inventories, integrated atmospheric models, and health risk func-
tions, we assess ship-related PM2.5 pollution impacts in 2020 with and without the use of
low-sulphur fuels. Cleaner marine fuels will reduce ship-related premature mortality and
morbidity by 34 and 54%, respectively, representing a ~ 2.6% global reduction in PM2.5
cardiovascular and lung cancer deaths and a ~3.6% global reduction in childhood asthma.
Despite these reductions, low-sulphur marine fuels will still account for ~250k deaths and
~6.4 M childhood asthma cases annually, and more stringent standards beyond 2020 may
provide additional health benefits. Lower sulphur fuels also reduce radiative cooling from ship
aerosols by ~80%, equating to a ~3% increase in current estimates of total anthropogenic
forcing. Therefore, stronger international shipping policies may need to achieve climate and
health targets by jointly reducing greenhouse gases and air pollution.

hip power systems emit a wide variety of pollutants that
have important health and climate change impacts. Fine
particulate matter (PM2.5), sulphur oxides (SOx), and
nitrogen oxides (NOx) that emerge from ship smokestacks lead to
premature mortality and morbidity effects that are well docu-
mented1–10. In particular, SOx emissions form sulphate (SO4)
aerosols that increase human health risks and contribute to
acidification in terrestrial and aquatic environments11. Sulphates
from ships also participate in regional short-lived aerosol cooling
that affects radiative budgets.
Given shipping’s significant contribution to global sulphur
inventories (estimated to be 13% of total SOx emissions
annually12), the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
proposed new global standards to limit sulphur (S) in fuel oil to
0.5% S (by mass) after January 1, 2020, from the current limit of
3.5% S. These standards will reduce sulphate aerosols and provide
health benefits to exposed populations. Sulphate reduction will
also directly and indirectly affect atmospheric light scattering and
absorption properties, thereby increasing net forcing effects that
contribute to climate change13–15. These coupled effects raise
both environmental and social implications because shipping
activity along major trading routes distributes these changes
heterogeneously. Thus, policymakers face tradeoffs whereby
achieving human health benefits may be associated with climate
change consequences16–18.
This work presents an integrated global spatial analysis that
assesses regional health benefits and net aerosol forcing effects for
current and future lower-sulphur marine fuels. Complying with
low-sulphur limits for marine fuels reduces ship air pollution and
attributable health impacts substantially. Prior to cleaner ship
fuels, ship-related health impacts include ~400,000 premature
deaths from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease and ~ 14
million childhood asthma cases annually. Reduced PM2.5 from
marine engine combustion mitigates ship-related premature
mortality and morbidity by 34 and 54%, respectively. Reduced
aerosol radiative cooling attributable to ship emissions accom-
panies health benefits from lower-sulphur fuels. Cleaner fuels
reduce radiative cooling from ship aerosols by ~80% (71 mW m
−2) due to lower direct aerosol cooling (−3.9 mW m−2) and lower
cloud albedo (−67 mW m−2). Local intensities of these changes in
health and climate directly relate to the major patterns of ship
traffic along major trade routes and continental coastlines.
Results
Overview of approach. On the basis of 2015 Automatic Identi-
fication System (AIS) data on shipping traffic (over 65,000 IMO
registered vessels and over 7.6 billion motion records), we project
2020 geospatial shipping emissions inventories with and without
implementation of the proposed standards. Using global chemical
transport models with very high spatial and temporal resolution
(10 × 10 km × 3 h), we evaluate the public health and climate
forcing consequences of low-sulphur marine fuel policy imple-
mentation. Atmospheric transport and transformations of ship-
emitted pollutants serve as inputs to modelling health effects, and
to estimating direct and indirect radiative forcing potential. All
computations incorporate existing regulations that limit sulphur
emissions from ships in designated Sulphur Emissions Control
Areas (SECAs). We report results of advanced shipping emissions
inventories for 2015 and 2020 scenarios, high-resolution spatial
and temporal chemistry-transport port model runs, health out-
comes using linear and log-linear concentration–response func-
tions, and radiative transfer evaluations of direct and indirect
aerosol forcing changes.
Global shipping emissions in 2015 with projections to 2020.
Global ship emissions were calculated using the Ship Traffic
Emissions Assessment Model (STEAM) model19–21 and 2015 AIS
ship traffic (see Methods). Emissions were projected to 2020
using vessel-type-specific annual growth rates (MEPC 70/5/322, 23
Table 166). Annual totals for emissions from global shipping for
2015 and 2020 are presented in Table 1, comparable with the
2012 results described in the Third IMO GHG Study12. Projected
business-as-usual (BAU) emission results of the global fleet in
2020 are consistent with those of the Third IMO GHG Study,
mainly reflecting growth assumptions; as shown in Table 1,
emissions reductions associated with implementation of a low-
sulphur fuel standard in 2020 (2020 Action) affect both SO2 and
PM (via reduction of sulphate emissions).
Implementation of the 2020 standards results in ~75%
reduction in shipping SOx emissions globally, along similar
spatial distribution of emissions without the new standards (see
Supplementary Figure 1). Supplementary Figure 1 also illustrates
the presence of an IMO-approved sulphur emissions control area
(SECA) designation for the United States (US) and Canada24; a
Chinese domestic emissions control area (DECA) designation for
the Bohai Sea, Yangtze River delta, and Pearl River delta in
China25; IMO-approved SECA designation in parts of Europe;
and additional European Union control requirements under the
European Directive26. In the European and US/Canadian SECAs,
ships are limited to burning 0.1% S fuel within 200 nautical miles
of the coast, whereas the limit under the European Directive and
in Chinese areas will be 0.5% S from the beginning of 2020 and
2019, respectively. These SECAs will be in force independent of
the IMO decision to implement global fuel sulphur standards.

 of Atmospheric coMposition (SILAM)27–29. SILAM was run at
geospatial resolution of 10 x 10 km and a temporal resolution of 3
h (see Methods section). We used SILAM to predict pollutant
concentrations under the following two scenarios: (1) business-
as-usual (BAU), which assumes no implementation of a global,
low-sulphur fuel standard; and (2) 2020 Action, which assumes
on time implementation of the IMO’s 0.5% S low-sulphur fuel
standard. Figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of atmospheric
PM2.5 near-surface concentrations under the BAU scenario; Fig. 2
presents the difference between the BAU scenario and the 2020
Action scenario. Related concentration maps provided in Sup-
plementary Figure 1 shows consistency with previous distribu-
tions at a global level30.
Considering all PM sources, typical concentrations of PM2.5
amount to a few μg m−3, with much higher levels in arid areas
and regions with strong fire activity (Fig. 1). Over the ocean, the
major component of PM2.5 is sea salt (over 50–75%), whereas
over land terrestrial emissions are the major contributor. Ship
contributions are visible mainly in the open ocean and over the
busiest sea-lanes. Stricter limits on sulphur content in ship fuel
decrease sulphate concentrations (2–4 μg SO4 m−3 annual
mean), leading to significant reduction of PM2.5 in the vicinity
of busy ship lanes (Fig. 2). However, total aerosol load
reduction is limited since sulphates constitute on average less
than 15% of total PM in the air (compare concentrations in
Figs. 1 and 2).

 Chemical links between sulphate and nitrate species resulted in
some ammonia becoming available for forming ammonium
nitrate, partly offsetting the sulphate aerosol reductions. However,
this effect is small and the offset only exceeds 1% around the east
coast of China, with a maximum of 15% over the Yellow Sea.
Health impacts of global shipping. We apply concentration–
response (C–R) functions to 2020 population projections to
estimate health impacts due to ship emissions in the BAU case
and the 2020 Action case (see Methods section). We calculate
adult mortality from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease and
childhood asthma morbidity, and report results using a linear
C–R function as discussed in Lepeule et al.31, and Zheng
et al.31, 32. The vast majority of PM2.5 exposure concentrations in
our study area represent conditions similar to those in the Six
Cities Study, indicating that functions derived from that study
can also apply to our study.
Total premature mortality due to shipping in the 2020 BAU
case is 403,300 per year (range of 212,300–595,400 based on the
95% confidence interval for relative risk); BAU mortality
distribution is shown in Fig. 3. Total avoided premature mortality
in 2020 with implementation of the low-sulphur fuel standards is
expected to be 266,300 per year (range of 138,500–395,700), a
reduction of ~ 34%); avoided mortality distribution is shown in
Fig. 4. Childhood asthma morbidity due to shipping declines by
54%, from 14 million children affected in the BAU case, to 6.4
million children in the 2020 Action case (see Supplementary
Note 1, Supplementary Figure 2. Detailed results are in Table 2,
and Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2 report
regional results.
More than 97% of the adult mortality benefits from ship
emissions reductions will be in Asia (80%), Africa (12%), and
Latin America and the Caribbean (5%). More than 98% of the
childhood morbidity benefits from ship emissions reductions also
occur in Asia (54%), Africa (33%), and Latin America and the
Caribbean (12%). The different distributions are primarily due to
the different distributions of adult and youth populations among
nations. Europe, North America, and Oceania combined will
receive <3% and <2% of the mortality and morbidity benefits of
the global sulphur standard, respectively. This is primarily due to

 existing legislation (with or without the global standards) in
North America, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the English
Channel, and EU sea areas in general (see Supplementary Note 2
for regional tables).
Our assessment of the global health burden due to air pollution
from ships are much higher than prior assessments primarily due
to improved geospatial resolution of global models, updated
inputs, and the use of linear C–R functions (see Methods section).
First, by applying higher spatial and temporal resolution using the
2020 STEAM inventories and SILAM chemistry transport model,
we more precisely assess proximal exposure concentrations, better
quantifying peak exposure to at-risk communities (see Supple-
mentary Note 2, Supplementary Figure 3). Second, the updates
provided by Lepeule, et al.31, increase the health risks attributable
to PM compared to previous assessments; e.g., the attributable
fraction for lung cancer due to PM2.5 exposure increases by a
factor of 2.5. Third, we adopt the so-called linear relative risk
function by Lepeule, et al.31, which differs from the log-linear
functions of Pope, et al.33 and Ostro34 used in our previous health
burden studies. The linear formulation produces characteristically
higher health burden estimates for the range of ship pollution
concentrations modelled (see Methods section and Supplemen-
tary Note 1). At higher concentrations, the combination of
updated β coefficients and C–R functional form can increase the
in-cell health burden estimate by orders of magnitude. Supple-
mentary Table 3 presents results using log-linear C–R function.
Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 present regional mortality and
asthma results using log-linear C–R function, respectively. Lung
cancer mortality using the linear function is more than three
times the log-linear C–R results in Supplementary Table 3, and
more than seven times the lung cancer estimates using coarser
resolution inputs in Winebrake et al.10. (Note that Winebrake
et al.10 computed premature cardiopulmonary mortality and
cannot be compared directly with cardiovascular mortality as
discussed in Methods section).
Our linear function BAU 2020 estimates in the East Asia region
are an order of magnitude higher than the health burden
estimated for 2013 by Liu et al.7 (238,100 vs. 24,000 air pollution
deaths from shipping). This is clearly a result of the different
choices of C–R functions, where Liu et al. use an assortment of
relative risk functions within their exposure–response model
based on Burnett et al.35. For our 2020 Action case, global
controls for sulphur standards would reduce the shipping health
burden in the East Asia domain of Liu et al. by 25% (with 34%
reduction of all Asia as shown in Supplementary Table 1).
Calculations using the log-linear C–R function in Supplementary
Note 3 are 45% higher than the health burden estimated by Liu
et al., and their estimates fall within the log-linear 95% confidence
interval.
Ship pollution matters in the context of total health impacts
from ambient (outdoor) air pollution, with or without the new
standards. Despite demonstrated health benefits associated with a
low-sulphur fuel standard, ship traffic using cleaner fuel will
produce air pollution impacting mortality and morbidity in
proximal coastal communities. The World Health Organization
(WHO) estimates ~3 million deaths in 2012 attributed to ambient
air pollution36, with 1.48 million attributed to lung cancer and
cardiovascular disease; the World Bank estimates 5.5 million
deaths in 2013 attributed to both household and ambient air
pollution (2.9 million due to ambient PM2.5)37. Other scientific
peer-reviewed journal papers report similar health burdens due to
ambient PM, with estimates ranging from 2.2 to 3.3 million
deaths annually38–42.
In terms of childhood asthma, the results are also quite
significant. Under our BAU case and linear risk function,
shipping emissions lead to ~14 million childhood asthma cases
annually. Further, even with the low-sulphur fuel standards
proposed by IMO, ships are still responsible for ~6.4 M childhood
asthma cases annually. The 2014 Global Asthma Study estimated
“as many as 334 million people in the world have asthma,” and
statistics indicate 26% of the world population is 14 years or
younger43. Without adjusting for higher prevalence for asthma
among young and old persons, direct application of population
statistics suggest 86 million children could suffer from asthma,
and our linear-function results suggest that shipping is currently
responsible for ~16% of these cases (~7.5% if the new IMO
standards are implemented).
Most synthesis reports reference sources using log-linear C–R
functions and matched β-coefficients35–42, and some meta-
analyses do not explicitly report underlying C–R functions
informing their health assessments. We can make bounding
comparisons of the contribution of ship pollution to global
cardiovascular and lung cancer mortality and asthma morbidity
assuming that our log-linear specifications compare better with
other studies (see Supplementary Note 3). Under the BAU
scenario, shipping accounts for about 3.6% of WHO and World
Bank mortality estimates from ambient air pollution, and nearly
7% of lung and cardiovascular disease mortality; shipping
pollution under the BAU scenario contributes to ~3.6% of
childhood asthma morbidity. Under the 2020 Action scenario,

 shipping would contribute about 2% of WHO and World Bank
air pollution total mortality from ambient air pollution, about 4%
of the lung cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality, and about
2.5% of childhood asthma. Cleaner ship fuels reduce exposure to
ambient PM2.5 air pollution, reducing total ambient air pollution
deaths from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease by ~2.6% and
reducing total childhood asthma by ~3%. Along major shipping
lanes and ports near densely populated coastal regions, these
health impacts are much greater.
Radiative forcing due to low-sulphur fuel. Global low-sulphur
fuel standards also impose climate forcing consequences. Sul-
phates from ship emissions reduce radiative flux at the earth’s
surface (i.e., contribute a cooling effect), previously estimated in
the range of −47 to −8 mW m−2 (direct radiative effect) and −600
to −38 mW m−2 (indirect radiative effects)15, 30, 44–46.
Our analysis covered direct and the first-indirect effects (i.e.,
impact on the number concentration and size of cloud droplets
and, consequently, cloud albedo via the Twomey effect). We
estimated these effects for a variety of assumptions regarding the
aerosol properties and meteorological conditions. We found that
the global average of the direct radiative forcing of ship-emitted
sulphates and nitrates strongly depends on the assumption of the
single-scattering albedo (SSA) of the particles, consistent with
Lohman et al.47 and Lesins et al.47, 48. The cooling under the BAU
scenario is about −5.2 mW m−2 and −1.5 mW m−2 for sulphate
and nitrate scattering aerosols, respectively (Table 3). Comparing
BAU and 2020 Action scenarios, reduction of sulphates will lead
to over 4 mW m−2 of reduced cooling, whereas the nitrate
concentrations will increase due to the compensation effect,
thereby adding extra cooling of almost 0.2 mW m−2. The net
reduced direct cooling will be 3.9 mW m−2 for scattering particles.
Estimation of the indirect effects remains very uncertain and
depends on the assumption on the distribution of the ship-
induced sulphate aerosols. We quantified the first-indirect effect
using empirical relationships between the sulphate and sea salt
concentrations derived from several cloud chemistry observation
campaigns49–51 (see Methods section). This allowed estimating
the sensitivity of the forcing in terms of the vertical in-cloud
distribution of the sulphate aerosols. In order to compute an
envelope of the possible variations, we considered two extreme
cases: (1) when the sulphates are well mixed with the cloud water,
i.e., the in-cloud convection mixes them perfectly; and, (2) when
the in-cloud convection does not affect the sulphate vertical
profiles. In the latter case, the sulphates and cloud-water vertical
profiles are largely detached, and the upper levels of the clouds
are practically not polluted by sulphates. For the well-mixed case,
the cooling by ship-induced sulphates amounts to −86 mW m−2
for our BAU scenario and −19 mW m−2 for 2020 Action scenario.
This means that the reduced cooling due to these first-indirect
effects is 67 mW m−2.
Sensitivity simulations for direct and indirect effects high-
lighted several parameters affecting the final estimates. The direct
radiative effect is strongly sensitive to aerosol optical features. The
ship-induced sulphates and nitrates in nature are not pure
scattering aerosols due to emissions of black carbon as part of
PM. Black carbon serves as condensation centres attracting SO2
and creating internally mixed particles with black cores coated by
sulphates. Sensitivity computations suggested that at SSA of
~0.975 the direct cooling effect of ship plumes is zero, whereas
darker aerosols are the warming agents (see Supplementary
Figure 5, for results with SSA = 0.999, 0.99, and 0.95). The tipping
point at SSA = 0.975 leads to all-zero direct forcing practically
everywhere48. Therefore, the change of the direct radiative forcing
due to low-sulphur standards will strongly depend on the
technologies used for reaching the limitations, specifically how
control technologies affect black carbon emissions52, 53.
Sensitivity of the indirect effect to the vertical profile of in-
cloud sulphates seems to be most important to our estimates. In
the detached sulphate profiles, the dominant effect of upper cloud
layers, which are practically not polluted by sulphates, determines
the overall cloud albedo regardless of the pollution at the cloud
bottom, resulting in the lower estimate. Therefore, if most of
sulphates are located near the cloud bottom, the reduced cooling
is much less than for the well-mixed case: 17 mW m−2 instead of
69 mW m−2 (see Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Figure 6).
With high-resolution simulations, however, the well-mixing
assumption is closer to observations, especially in tropical
conditions, where horizontal size of the convective clouds is
indeed of the order of 10 km. Therefore, the best estimate from
this study is 69 mW m−2.
The
above
results
are
generally
consistent
with
other
literature15, 46, 54, 55. Thus, Eyring et al.54 roughly estimated
direct cooling effect of sulphates of −11 to −26 mW m−2 in 2030
depending on traffic scenarios54, which is well in line with our
BAU case plus the increase of ship traffic by 2030. Fuglesvedt
et al.46 estimated indirect negative forcing from ship sulphate
aerosols as −66 mW m−2 compare to preindustrial level (uncer-
tainty range (−114, −38) mW m−2), which also compares well to
our range of the first-indirect effect (−86, −22) mW m−2 46.
Capaldo et al.56 suggested −110 mW m−2, but the evaluation
against SO2 mixing ratio observations showed almost an order of
magnitude of over-estimation. A study of Dalsoren et al.57
considered a similar set of ship emission scenarios and estimated
the total loss of sulphate-induced cooling at −70 mW m−2 with
10–15% variability depending on scenario of ship emission in
2030, which is in close agreement with our estimates. However,
Dalsoren et al. suggested that direct and indirect effects are
similar in amplitude, which differs from our and most other
studies, which showed ~10-fold dominance of indirect effect(s).
Our BAU 2020 direct radiative forcing estimates are also
consistent with the estimates by Liu et al.7 in East Asia7. This
work estimates the BAU direct forcing in East Asia averages −23
mW m−2 (standard deviation of −14 mW m−2), with a region
peak and minimum forcing of −55 mW m−2 and −1.5 mW m−2,
respectively. We identify two local maxima for sulphate and
nitrate radiative forcing (Fig. 3), one in the East Asia domain
aligned with Liu et al., and a second region with greater maxima
in the South China Sea. Liu et al. evaluated AIS-derived shipping
only within their East Asia study domain, which included only a
portion of the shipping traffic in the South China Sea. Our global
AIS-derived shipping domain extends the major shipping lanes

A few studies showed much larger effects than the ones above.
Tronstad Lund et al.15 based on regression between total sulphur
emission and radiative forcing suggested the indirect cooling
effect as high as −450 mW m−2. However, a relative reduction was
estimated as 37–40% in direct and indirect aerosol forcing from
fuel changes originally presented by Lauer et al.58, about half of
the results reported in this work58. In turn, Lauer et al.58
estimated the direct effect at the same −11 mW m−2 level as
came from our computations but got the indirect effect varying
from −190 to −600 mW m−2 (about 75% of these attributed to
sulphates) depending on ship emission inventory58. A similar
study of Righi et al.59 showed the range from −280 to −400 mW
m−2 but used higher ship SOx emission of 14 Mton per year.
Balkansky et al. (2010) reported shipping direct effect of −20 mW
m−2, and also pointed out the compensation by direct warming
effect of road-traffic carbonaceous aerosols.44 For global esti-
mates, including CO2, the net reduced cooling of this study
amounts to nearly 35% of the total radiative forcing from
transport46 and over 3% of anthropogenic radiative forcing13.
Considering the reasons for the differences from some of the
previous work, one can notice a generally lower-sulphur lifetime
and global mean burden in the current simulations in comparison
with other studies. For example, we estimate a 0.6 Mton sulphur
burden (2015), vs. 1.5 Mton sulphur burden (mean 1999–2004)
assumed by Lauer, et al. Accounting for the lower emission of SOx
in 2015 (111 vs. 150 Mton per year in Dentener et al.60 used by
Lauer et al.), one ends up with the mean atmospheric lifetime of
sulphur of about 2.8 days in the current study and 3.6 days in
Lauer, et al. Species-specific lifetimes in our runs were 1.5 days for
SO2 (primary sink is oxidation to SO4) and 2.8 days for sulphates,
i.e. dry and wet deposition of sulphates are the primary
mechanisms controlling the total-sulphur burden in SILAM.
These lifetimes are within the range of values reported by other
models61, with the SILAM estimate being more on the lower end.
Evaluation of SILAM is outlined in Supplementary Note 5.
With our results comparing BAU and 2020 Action scenarios,
Table 3 presents the estimated change in the radiative forcing
from cleaner ship fuels on the following: (a) the shipping sector,
(b) the transportation sector, and (c)all anthropogenic activity.
The cleaner fuels will also shift the composition of the forcing
aerosols. In the BAU scenario, over two-thirds of the cooling is
due to sulphates, whereas the contributions of sulphates and
nitrates are practically the same under the 2020 Action scenario.
Similar to patterns of near-surface PM2.5 concentrations, highly
heterogeneous ship traffic density and meteorological conditions
determine the radiative forcing patterns (Fig. 5). In particular, the
most-significant regional direct radiative effect is over the Persian
Gulf, where very dense emissions coincide with large fraction of
cloud-free days. Shipping in Southeast Asia is stronger and leads
to higher ship-induced PM2.5 concentrations covering wider area
(Fig. 1). However, the resulting direct radiative forcing is lower
than in the Persian Gulf region due to a larger number of cloudy
days. For the indirect forcing, the pattern is likely to be the
opposite: the effect will be more pronounced in cloudy regions of
South-East Asia.
Discussion
Global compliance with 2020 marine fuel-sulphur standards will
reduce annual premature mortality and morbidity in nations
across the globe. We demonstrate significant mortality and
morbidity benefits from low-sulphur ship fuels in densely
populated, major-trading nations. Additionally, even coastal
nations, which are not engaged heavily in international trade will
benefit, if these nations are proximal to major shipping routes.
The distributional impacts associated with air pollution health
burdens and the benefits of new standards should be considered
in future research. Health burdens and benefits are accompanied
by important changes in the regional distribution and global net
radiative forcing due to ship-emitted aerosols, which can itself
lead to potential health impacts associated with a warmer planet.
Even with cleaner marine fuels after 2020, shipping activity will
continue to produce harmful air emissions and greenhouse gases.

 Notwithstanding the first meaningful global fuel-sulphur controls
since fleets converted from coal to petroleum byproducts, energy
use in global trade is expected to increase, along with air emis-
sions from shipping12. Given that low-sulphur marine fuels still
account annually for ~250k deaths (CI 95% ~139k; ~396k) and
~6.4 M childhood asthma cases (CI 95% ~4.1 to 11.5 million),
additional
reductions
beyond
2020
standards
may
prove
beneficial.
Sulphate-specific impacts quantified here cannot be posed
strictly as offsetting tradeoffs. Emission reductions of sulphur
aerosols by ships using cleaner marine fuels may offer collateral
health and climate benefits that merit quantification beyond this
work. For example, 2020 compliant fuels may enable or be
accompanied with other PM2.5 emission reductions, such as
organic carbon particles and black carbon particles which con-
tribute to strongly warming effects62. Moreover, many control
technologies for harmful particulates and ozone precursor emis-
sions perform better under low-sulphur combustion conditions.
In a broader context, near-term air-quality health implications
and longer-term health implications related to climate forcing
deserve joint consideration.
Ship emissions impacts reported here will inform evaluation of
additional air pollutant health and climate impacts from shipping
activities, and future shipping policies to achieve environmental
stewardship goals in shipping and related transportation sectors
serving a global economy. International policymaking efforts
jointly pursuing air pollution health benefits and climate targets
may increase the urgency for continued progress to control and
reduce greenhouse gases.
Methods
Geospatial emissions inventories. For this research, we constructed geospatial
shipping emissions inventories under the following two scenarios: (1) a business-
as-usual (BAU) scenario, where we assume shipping emissions are not constrained
by a global fuel sulphur standard; and (2) a policy implementation case (2020
Action), where the IMO MARPOL VI fuel sulphur standard goes into effect in
2020. The emissions inventory was facilitated by the use of the Ship Traffic
Emission Assessment Model (STEAM), which has been used in similar types of
work6, 12, 19–21, 63–65. The STEAM model combines 2015 AIS data on shipping
routes and volume as well as vessel technical data from IHS Fairplay, with peer-
reviewed energy use and emissions equations to construct a geospatial emissions
inventory for global shipping. Propulsion energy is evaluated with the Hollenbach
resistance calculation method, which is based on tank tests66. The STEAM model
employs a range of emissions factors, specific to fuel types, engine types, and engine
load, and Table 4 presents a range of these values with notes below the table.
Emission factors for NOx depend on engine crankshaft speed (rpm) and age.
The IMO Tiers are applied for engines, where Tier 0 follows the definitions of the
Third IMO GHG study12, and where Tiers 1–3 follow the functions defined in
MARPOL VI.
Emission factors for sulphur oxides (SOx) are determined from fuel sulphur
content (% by weight) and the amount of fuel consumed at specific engine load.
Part of fuel sulphur is emitted as primary PM and the sulphur fraction included in
SO4 is subtracted from sulphur available for SOx formation in the atmosphere. All
gaseous emissions of sulphur are calculated as SO2. Sulphur content for residual
fuel use outside of ECA regions in the BAU scenario were assigned 2.7% S, similar
to the Third IMO GHG Study; in the 2020 Action scenario, sulphur content was
adjusted to 0.5% S. Where lower fuel limits will be in place in 2020 due to current
legislation, the maximum sulphur content was set accordingly: (i) the IMO ECA
regions (0.1% S)5; (ii) the regions covered by the European Directive (0.5% S)26;
(iii) China legislation applied to the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and
Bohai Sea (0.5% S)25.
Particulate matter is modelled as dry PM without the associated water, which
normally accompanies the sulphate aerosol. The mass of associated water depends
on the ambient conditions (temperature, humidity) and the consecutive chemical
transport modelling step takes the hygroscopicity of PM into account.
The emission factor for CO2 depends on fuel type and specific fuel oil
consumption (SFOC) at a specific load point. The base SFOC (at 80% engine load)
depends on engine age, power output and stroke type, as defined in the Second
IMO GHG Study 200967. Table 4 lists the range of values for HFO and MDO/
MGO at high and low engine loads. These examples represent the extremes used in
the model for diesel engines. This approach necessitates SFOC modelling as a
function of engine load and further details can be found in Jalkanen et al.20 and the
Third IMO GHG Study12.
Base year inventory adjustments for 2020. Ship inventories for future years
were adjusted for the year 2020 using vessel type compound annual growth rates
(Table 5), which are consistent with energy use base case growth rates used in the
2016 IMO FAS (see MEPC 70/5/623, Table 166). These growth rates produce future
year inventories for ship energy demand and emissions that are lower than some
other demand estimates submitted to MEPC-70 by observer delegations [MEPC
70/5/5]68; if higher energy demand estimates were used, the health impact from
uncontrolled sulphur levels would be greater. The projected emission results of the
global fleet in 2020 are similar to those of the Third IMO GHG Study. Largest
differences are because of reduction of sulphur in marine fuels, which has an
impact on SOx and PM emissions.
Atmospheric simulations and radiative forcing. The atmospheric simulations
have been performed by the chemical transport model SILAM (System for Inte-
grated modeLing of Atmospheric coMposition, http://silam.fmi.fi)69–72 with spatial
resolution of 0.1 degree longitude-latitude, 13 uneven stacked layers, terrain-

 following near surface and reaching ~330 hPa at the highest model altitude (see
Supplementary Note 5). The output time step was 3 h for all produced quantities:
concentrations; dry and wet deposition; and optical thickness at 380 nm, 550 nm,
and 1020 nm wavelength.
The non-shipping gridded emissions inventories prepared as input into SILAM
include a number of different sources. Anthropogenic source inventories are
obtained through HTAPv2+MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for
China)+REAS (Regional Emission Inventory in Asia)73; fires inventories are from
IS4FIRES (from FMI, http://is4fires.fmi.fi/72; sea salt inventories are embedded in
SILAM72; desert dust inventories are embedded in SILAM following the saltation
mechanism that Marticorena & Bergametti (1995) advanced in several follow-up
works74–77; DMS from sea surface is embedded in SILAM after Kettle et al. (2000)1;
biogenic VOC inventories are from MEGAN-MACC78; and aircraft emissions are
from RETRO (http://retro-archive.iek.fz-juelich.de/data/documents/reports/D1-
6_final.pdf).
Simulations were driven with the meteorological fields of the Integrated
Forecasting System (IFS) of the ECMWF with spatial resolution of 0.1 × 0.1 degree
and temporal resolution of 3 h. Chemical transformations were computed
following the set of gas-phase reactions of CBM-IV carbon-bond mechanism2 with
updated reaction rates following the IUPAC guidelines (http://iupac.pole-ether.fr/).
They were complemented with inorganic aerosol formation reactions described in
Sofiev (2000)79 for sulphates, nitrates and ammonium. Formation of sulphates was
considered as an irreversible reaction, whereas ammonium nitrate was in
equilibrium with nitric acid and ammonia. This mechanism was extended with the
production of coarse nitrates due to replacement of chlorine on sea salt particles.
The organic aerosol precursors were limited to biogenic isoprene and
monoterpenes, with emissions computed by Model of Emissions of Gases and
Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). A volatility-basis set (VBS) scheme80, 81 was
applied to organic aerosol oxidation. All secondary aerosols were considered to be
submicron in size under dry conditions but growing if relative humidity goes above
species-specific deliquescence points. External mixing of particles was assumed.
Primary particles were represented by anthropogenic elemental and organic
carbon as well as mineral PM, all in two size sections: below and above 2.5 μm in
diameter. The non-anthropogenic primary aerosols were sea salt (5 bins from 0.01
up to 30 μm), desert dust (4 bins from 0.1 up to 30 μm) and smoke from vegetation
fires (3 bins from 0.1 up to 6 μm). Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary
Figure 7, and Supplementary Figure 8 provide further information.
We calculated changes in direct radiative forcing from the change in the aerosol
optical depth (AOD) of the atmosphere due to sulphates and nitrates from ships
under the BAU and 2020 Action scenarios. We assumed no emission reductions
for primary particulates (ash and elemental and organic carbon) and NOx under
the low-sulphur scenario. Direct radiative forcing was computed as the difference
of the upward radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere.
The radiative transfer modelling was completed offline with the Library for
radiative transfer (libRadtran) software package for radiative transfer calculations82
following the approach of Soares et al.83. The libRadTran tool calculates radiances,
irradiances, and actinic fluxes for the given optical properties. The Earth radiative
balance results from the difference between the incoming and outgoing radiative
fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). The impact of aerosols is assessed by the
difference in the upward fluxes at the TOA for the atmosphere with and without
particles, for both BAU and 2020 Action scenarios. The calculations were defined
with wavelength ranging from 0.2 to 4.0 µm. To limit the amount of calculations,
the SILAM AOD fields were averaged to a 3° × 3° grid. All the runs used 3D cloud
liquid- and ice-water content, cloud cover and surface albedo taken from the IFS.
The aerosol optical depth diagnosed by SILAM was superimposed to the default
vertical distribution of aerosols defined in libRadTran. The prescribed aerosol
optical properties, such as single scattering albedo, asymmetry factor and
Ångström exponent were used. To get integrated radiative fluxes, 3-hourly global
fields of outgoing radiation at the TOA were averaged over the whole year.
The first indirect aerosol effect—via impact on the size and the number of cloud
droplets and, consequently, on cloud albedo—was computed using the empirical
relationship suggested in a series of works49–51 and used in modern numerical
weather prediction systems such as IFS of ECMWF. The most-uncertain part of it
is the multi-component relation, which would include effects of non-sea-salt
sulphates combined with the sea salt and non-sulphate anthropogenic aerosols. The
approximation formulas in these works suggest a power-law type of dependence,
thus claiming zero number concentration of droplets in absence of anthropogenic
sulphates. In addition, part of the data with heavy sea salt load was removed from
the analysis. A review of the data of Borys et al.49 leads to another approximation
that describes the whole data set without any withdrawal. It also manifests a
physically meaningful asymptote for pristine areas:
Dn ¼ a þ bCNSS þ cCSSLT:
Here Dn, CNSS, and CSSLT are concentrations of cloud droplets, non-sea-salt
sulphates and sea salt, respectively. Fitting constants a = 31 # m−3, b = 93.5 # μg
−1, c = 16.5 # μg−1 (where # refers to number of particles).
Health impact analysis and uncertainty. The process of calculating the health
impact analysis follows the general approach discussed in previous work4, 10. Prior
work applied a mortality risk analysis discussed in Ostro (2004)34, which built on
work developed out of the United States Harvard Six Cities study conducted earlier
by Pope, et al.33, 84, 85. The vast majority of PM2.5 exposure concentrations in our
study area study area represent conditions similar to those in the Harvard Six Cities
study, indicating that premature mortality functions derived from that study can
also apply to our study (see Supplementary Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure 10).
We conduct a similar assessment (updated with new population data, incidence
data, and concentration data) using a recently preferred concentration–response
(C–R) function from Lepeule, et al.31, which updates epidemiology from the
Harvard Six Cities study31. Recognising that Marshall et al.86 specifically notes that
the proper functional form is as yet unclear, we present the log-linear C–R function
results in Supplementary Note 3 (see global results in Supplementary Table 3, and
regional results in Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Table 5). The linear
C–R function reflects new understanding about the relationship between health
impacts and exposure to increased air pollution concentrations and better describes
the global range of exposures to global shipping pollution across a long-tailed
distribution of PM2.5 concentrations (see Supplementary Figure 9). Therefore, the
linear C–R function (shown below) provides better estimates of health impacts
where i) ambient concentrations of PM2.5 are high (e.g., >20 µg m−3, WHO
guidelines), and ii) major ship traffic contributes more to ambient concentrations
(e.g., >10 µg m−3). Supplementary Note 3 provides an alternate, log-linear C–R
function and β coefficients, following Barnett et al. Supplementary Figure 4 illus-
trates that the log-linear function produces higher relative risk under low initial
concentration (C0) conditions, but appears to imply a saturation effect at higher
ambient air pollution concentrations that is not evident in air health impact stu-
dies. The log-linear C–R construct enables matched comparison with most of the
global health assessments, which do not adopt the linear C–R and β recommended
by Lepeule’s updates. We focus on cardiovascular and lung cancer mortality
responses as identified by Lepeule, et al.31. We also extend the health analysis to
include for the first time an assessment of childhood asthma morbidity, which uses
similar concentration–response equations based on reported asthma incident rates
by nation32.
Concentration–response functions for chronic exposure adult mortality
correspond to impacts for a population cohort aged 30 years or more using
Lepeule, et al.31. Concentration–response functions for childhood asthma
morbidity correspond to impacts for a population cohort aged 14 years or younger
using Zheng (2015). Our gridded population data are from NASA’s Socioeconomic
Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) Population of the World, Version 487. We
apply age cohort fractions directly to the population counts for each nation from
the United Nations to determine the age cohort populations by country88. The
Median Variant values for the year 2020 were used to calculate the 30–99 fraction,
based on summing population across all age cohorts at 30 years or older and
dividing by the total population.
We calculated country-specific incidence rates for cardiovascular disease and
lung cancer using data from the World Health Organization’s Global Health
Observatory (GHO), which publishes mortality by age cohort and country, and
GLOBALCAN, respectively89, 90. In particular, we divided reported deaths from
WHO by WHO population estimates for age cohorts 30–99 to calculate an
incidence rate for each disease per 100,000 people over 30 years of age. We make a
simplifying assumption to attribute all cardiovascular disease and lung cancer
deaths to the over 30 population, which is demonstrated to be the case after
reviewing cause of death data by age cohort. In cases, where country data were not
available through this data source, we used an additional WHO data source that
publishes cardiovascular diseases mortality using an age-standardised death rate
(ASR) per 100,000. These data were converted to crude (non-ASR) values using a
non-ASR:ASR ratio. For lung cancer mortality incidence rates, we use data from
GLOBOCAN 201289. To determine overall health impacts associated with ship
emissions and the potential effects of IMO policy delays, we calculate expected
mortality under the BAU and 2020 Action scenarios by comparing concentration
results of these scenarios with a no-shipping case, whereby emissions from ships
are removed from the geospatial inventory prior to SILAM processing.
We obtained country-specific incidence rates for childhood asthma using data
from the 2014 Global Asthma Report43. Specifically, we used the current wheeze
data from the ISAAC world map data as reported in the 2014 Global Asthma
Report. Zheng et al.32 provide relative risk (RR) factors for childhood asthma from
exposure to PM2.5 pollution (Table 2 of Zheng), which we convert to β coefficients.

 We calculated expected mortality and morbidity due to changes in total
particulate matter concentrations using approaches mentioned above, consistent
with other recent work in this area7, 10. The total effect (E) of changes for each grid
cell is given as:
E ¼ AF � B � P;

exposed population; and AF is the attributable fraction of mortality or morbidity to

mortality31, 35, 85; and where β = 0.002469 (95% CI = 0.001291, 0.003633) for
childhood asthma morbidity32.
We apply mortality C–R functions in a way that is consistent with previous
work published by Winebrake, et al.10. There are several important differences in
this health analysis compared with previous work; however, similar types of
uncertainties affect our health results (some reducing and some increasing
uncertainty ranges).
One important uncertainty involves global ship emissions and inventories.
Inventory uncertainties using the AIS data and bottom-up models are both reduced
and more transparent than previous work that used AMVER and ICOADS data in
top-down geospatial inventories, similar to rigorous bottom-up inventory
uncertainty analyses reported by the IMO, which also employed an approach
similar to the STEAM model12. STEAM also applies a fully dynamic spatial-
temporal variation of global ship emissions that reduces uncertainty further.
Conducting our analysis at a 10 × 10 km resolution reduces spatial uncertainty that
existed in previous work. This analysis uses a geospatial resolution considerably
more resolved that other comparable work in the literature. To understand how the
geospatial resolution affects results, we compare our 10 × 10 km gridded results
with results from an analysis done at a 50 × 50 km resolution (Supplementary
Figure 7). This comparison demonstrates the heterogeneous regional effects that
can result due to geospatial resolution, with notable under-estimation of emissions
over large parts of Southeast Asia and Western Europe when using more coarse
model outputs.
Another uncertainty is in the specification of a linear C–R function results in
higher health impact estimates where shipping pollution concentrations are higher.
Based on Lepeule et al.31, we use a linear C–R function. Comparison of linear and
log-linear C–R functions using different concentration differences demonstrate that
the linear model in-grid-cell estimates can be more than an order of magnitude
greater than health impacts estimated for the same concentration differences using
the log-linear model. Direct comparison of Lepeule and Ostro lung cancer beta-
coefficients indicates Lepeule coefficients produce higher estimated mortality
impacts. Ostro (2004) estimates the relative risk for lung cancer due to a 1 µg m−3
concentration increase (using the so called linear formulation) to be 1.012751,
corresponding to an attributable fraction (AF) of 0.01259, and beta coefficient of
0.01267. Lepeule (2012) estimates lung cancer relative risk to be 1.031982,
corresponding to an AF of 0.030991 and beta coefficient of 0.031481 Ostro’s 2004
best or central estimate for lung cancer beta-coefficients falls within Lepeule’s 95th
percentile confidence range. In addition to lung cancer mortality, this work
evaluates cardiovascular mortality, where our prior mortality work evaluated
cardiopulmonary mortality. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a broad term for a
range of diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels that include
cardiopulmonary conditions (cardiovascular conditions involving the lungs).
Therefore, we observe as expected that Lepeule’s beta coefficients for CVD are not
directly comparable with Ostro’s beta coefficients for cardiopulmonary disease, but
produce higher estimated mortality impacts.
Lepeule uses additional years’ data to evaluate a broader uncertainty range than
Ostro et al., providing a quantitative and consistent update to earlier assessments of
regional and global health burden from shipping. Note that Lepeule et al.31 not
only has a higher value for the coefficient mid-point, but also a wider 95%
confidence interval for the beta coefficient compared to previous work.
Employment of best-available incidence rates for each country in a common set
of C–R functions applied to the global population assumes pollution response
similarity and recognises uncertainty where in-country incidence rates are poorly
known or under reported91, 92. Where unavailable, global averages incidence rates
are used. This source of uncertainty appears to affect asthma morbidity estimates
more so than mortality estimates. We observe, for example, that nations with more
advanced healthcare systems (i.e., typically wealthier nations) report higher
underlying incidence rates for childhood asthma. For mortality, the uncertainty in
underlying incidence rates is somewhat mitigated based on results of
epidemiological studies that show similar concentration–response patterns across
different countries34, 93, 94.
A final area of uncertainty includes assumptions about the geographic
distribution of populations geospatially. We distribute uniformly across each
country the fraction of population under the age of 14 and between the ages of 30
and 99. This may not account for in-country spatial differences in age cohort
distributions (e.g., age distributions in coastal communities that may differ from
national statistics). Also, this use Knowing that “the burden of asthma, measured by
disability and premature death, is greatest in children approaching adolescence
(ages 10–14) and the elderly (ages 75–79)”43, assigning age cohorts uniformly may
produce conservatively low estimates low for childhood asthma morbidity.
Code availability. The STEAM model is intellectual property of the Finnish
Meteorological Institute (FMI) and is not publicly available. This code uses a real-
time connection to IHS Fairplay ship register, requiring an annual subscription.
Bilateral contracts between data providers and FMI govern access to input data sets
that are required for the modelling, such as vessel activity and ship technical data.
The work described in this manuscript did not contain modifications of the
STEAM model; model description can be found in the references. The SILAM
model is an open-code system and is free for research applications. The model can
be obtained by contacting persons responsible for the SILAM model development
(visit silam.fmi.fi for more information). The health risk functions are fully
described in the manuscript and do not require code to replicate; data obtained for
this work are also publicly available and cited.
Data availability. FMI may share STEAM outputs upon request as long as the
data are in aggregated form, individual vessels cannot be identified, and the
commercial input data cannot be reverse engineered from model outputs. The
gridded ship emission files used in this work are available from FMI ftp site upon
request to authors. The gridded population data used in this work were taken
from NASA’s Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) Population
of the World, Version 4. This data set is available at http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.
