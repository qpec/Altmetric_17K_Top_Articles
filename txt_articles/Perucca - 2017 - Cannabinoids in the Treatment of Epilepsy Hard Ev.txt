The interest in cannabis-based products for the treatment of refractory epilepsy has skyrocketed in 
recent years. Marijuana and other cannabis products with high content in Δ(9) –tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC), utilized primarily for recreational purposes, are generally unsuitable for this indication, primarily 
because THC is associated with many undesired effects. Compared with THC, cannabidiol (CBD) 
shows a better defined anticonvulsant profile in animal models and is largely devoid of adverse 
psychoactive effects and abuse liability. Over the years, this has led to an increasing use of 
CBD-enriched extracts in seizure disorders, particularly in children. Although improvement in seizure 
control and other benefits on sleep and behavior have been often reported, interpretation of the data is 
made difficult by the uncontrolled nature of these observations. Evidence concerning the potential 
anti-seizure efficacy of cannabinoids reached a turning point in the last 12 months, with the completion 
of three high-quality placebo-controlled adjunctive-therapy trials of a purified CBD product in patients 
with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In these studies, CBD was found to be superior to 
placebo in reducing the frequency of convulsive (tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, and atonic) seizures in 
patients with Dravet syndrome, and the frequency of drop seizures in patients with Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome. For the first time, there is now class 1 evidence that adjunctive use of CBD improves seizure 
control in patients with specific epilepsy syndromes. Based on currently available information, however, 
it is unclear whether the improved seizure control described in these trials was related to a direct action 
of CBD, or was mediated by drug interactions with concomitant medications, particularly a marked 
increased in plasma levels of N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam. Clarification of 
the relative contribution of CBD to improved seizure outcome requires re-assessment of trial data for the 
subgroup of patients not comedicated with clobazam, or the conduction of further studies controlling for 
the confounding effect of this interaction. (2017;7:61-76)

Introduction
The history of human use of the Cannabis plant goes back to the 
dawn of mankind. The plant, which originated in Central Asia or in 
the foothills of the Himalayas, was initially cultivated in China for fi-
ber and seed production, and in India for resin production.1 For many 
centuries, European and East Asian societies have used mostly 
Cannabis strains containing low amounts (< 1% dry weight) of the 
psychoactive principle 9-Δ-tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC), and their 
main utilization was for fiber and food. Conversely, African, 
Middle-Eastern, South Asian, and Southeast Asian societies have 
used cannabis primarily for its psychoactive properties, with strains 
from these regions often containing 5-10% THC.1 
The first studies on the medical use of cannabis date back to the 
Chinese Emperor Shen Nung (about 2,700 B.C.).2 As evidence of the 
important role of the plant in ancient Chinese culture, archeological 
excavations in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region of China 
have recently unearthed a 2,700-year-old grave of a shaman which 
contained a large cache of cannabis, perfectly preserved by climatic 
and burial conditions, presumably employed as a medicinal or psy-
choactive agent, or as an aid to divination.3 Early written records of 
medical applications can be traced to Sumerian and Akkadian tab-

lets, around 1,800 B.C., which mention the use of a medicinal plant, 
most likely cannabis, to treat a variety of ailments, including noctur-
nal convulsions.2,4 In less ancient times, there are records in the 
Arabic and Islamic literature which mention explicitly cannabis as a 
treatment for seizures and epilepsy.4
The first detailed modern description of the utility of canna-
bis-based products as an anti-seizure medication was published in 
1843 by W.B. O’Shaughnessy, physician in the Bengal Army and Late 
Professor of Chemistry and Materia Medica at the Medical College of 
Calcutta. After testing the behavioral effects of various preparations 
of Cannabis indica in healthy fish, dogs, swines, vultures, crows, 
horses, deers, monkeys, goats, sheep, cows, and military assistants, 
he investigated the potential value of extracts of the plant in patients 
with different disorders, and reported remarkable anti-seizure effects 
in a 40-days-old baby girl with recurrent convulsive seizures.5 These 
observations were taken up by other physicians, including Sir William 
Gowers, who described the effectiveness of Cannabis indica against 
seizures resistant to bromides.6  
In the twentieth century the use of cannabis declined somewhat 
because cultivation of the plant was made illegal in many countries. 
However, scientific advances on the properties of the plant pro-
gressed as chemists and pharmacologists started on work on the 
chemical characterization of its active ingredients, and on the rela-
tionship between their molecular structure and biological activity. 
While various reports focused on the effects of smoked cannabis on 
seizure control, it soon became clear that the psychoactive effects of 
THC limited the applicability of crude cannabis preparations in the 
treatment of seizures, and attention shifted to the potential utility of 
non-psychoactive ingredients such cannabidiol (CBD).2 Although in-
terest in ‘medical marijuana’ and its individual constituents for the 
treatment of seizures persisted through the years, it is only in the last 
decade that preclinical and clinical research into the potential appli-
cation of cannabis in the treatment of epilepsy has literally exploded 
(Fig. 1). The purpose of the present article is to review the pharmaco-
logical basis of the anti-seizure effects of cannabis and particularly its 
non-psychoactive constituents, and to discuss critically the expand-
ing range of evidence on the efficacy of these compounds in the 
management of different seizure types and epilepsy syndromes. 
Chemistry and mechanisms of action
The genus Cannabis refers to a flowering plant of which there are 
three main species, Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis 
ruderalis. These plants contain over 100 biologically active chemicals 
called cannabinoids, with the most abundant and best characterized 
among those being THC and CBD (Fig. 2).7 Crude preparations of 
cannabis include dried leaves, stems and flower pods (marijuana), 
resins (hashish), and oily extracts (hashish oil), all of which have been 
used through the centuries mostly for their psychoactive properties. 
In general, cannabis products derived from Cannabis sativa exhibit a 
higher CBD/THC ratio than products derived from Cannabis indica. 
Different Cannabis strains have been bred either to maximize THC

content or, conversely, to reduce THC content and increase the con-
centration of CBD and other non-psychoactive ingredients.8
Many biological actions of cannabinoids are mediated by their in-
teraction with two closely related receptors, cannabinoid receptor 
type 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2), although a variety of other receptors and 
targets are also involved in the effects of these compounds.9-13 Both 
the CB1 and the CB2 receptors belong to the class of Gi/o-coupled 
metabotropic receptors and are widely distributed throughout the 
central nervous system (CNS), with CB1 receptors being localized pri-
marily in neurons and CB2 receptors being expressed in microglia 
and, to a greater extent, in the immune system.9 The discovery of 
cannabinoid receptors in the CNS led to a search for endogenous 
substances interacting with these receptors and to the identification 
of so-called ‘endogenous cannabinoids’, the most important of 
which are the arachidonic acid derivatives anandamide (2-arachido-
noylethanolamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol.9 Extensive evidence 
has now accumulated that endocannabinoids play an important role 
in the control in synaptic transmission and the regulation of the rate 
of neuronal firing.13-17 In the CNS, CB1 receptors are expressed pre-
synaptically on both glutamatergic and GABAergic interneurons, and 
activation of these receptors results in inhibition of synaptic trans-
mission, including glutamate release.9,10,16 An involvement of endo-
cannabinoid signaling pathways in the pathophysiology of epilepsy 
(and the possibility of targeting these pathways for therapeutic pur-
poses) is suggested by a number of experimental and clinical 
observations. Experimentally, many studies reviewed in recent ar-
ticles10,14,16,17 have demonstrated that endogenous cannabinoids sys-
tems are altered in a variety of models of seizures, epilepsy and epi-
leptogenesis, whereas external modulation of these systems can pre-
vent or modulate seizure activity. Clinically, observations implicating 
a role of endocannabinoid systems in epilepsy include the finding of 
reduced anandamide concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of in-
dividuals with new-onset temporal lobe epilepsy;18 demonstration of 
downregulation of CB1 receptors and related molecular components 
in glutamatergic neurons from surgical samples of epileptic human 
hippocampus;19 demonstration of sprouting of CB1-receptor ex-
pressing GABAergic axons (or increased expression of CB1-receptors 
on these fibers) in sclerotic human hippocampi;20 and PET evidence 
of differential changes in CB1 receptor availability in the seizure on-
set zone and in the insula of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and 
hippocampal sclerosis.21
Cannabinoids have numerous and complex pharmacological 
properties. In experimental models, for example, THC displays com-
plex psychoactive effects, variable anticonvulsant effects, and an-
algesic, cognitive, muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory, appetite 
stimulant, and antiemetic activity.9,12,22 On the other hand, CBD is 
mostly devoid of adverse psychoactive effects and possesses anti-
convulsant, analgesic, anti-anxiety, antiemetic, immune-modulating, 
anti-inflammatory, neuroprotectant, and anti-tumorigenic pro-
perties.9,12,22 In the case of THC, anti-seizure activity seems to be 
mediated to an important extent by its partial agonist action on the 
CB1 receptor, which is also primarily involved in the expression of 
psychoactive effects.9,13,23 CBD, on the other hand, has very weak af-
finity for the CB1 and CB2 receptors and its anti-seizure activity at 
clinically relevant concentrations is considered to be mediated by 
other mechanisms,13,24,25 possibly including functional agonism or 
antagonism at multiple 7-transmembrane receptors, ion channels, 
and neurotransmitter transporters (Table 1).24-35 In particular, an ef-
fect on adenosine reuptake and antagonism of G protein-coupled re-
ceptor 55 (GPR55) have been recently suggested to play an im-
portant role in CBD anti-seizure activity.36

Pharmacological profile in experimental 
models of seizures and epilepsy
Among the many active principles found in the cannabis plant, 
THC is the most widely investigated for its many actions, including its 
psychoactive effects and risks associated with overdose and abuse. 
THC shows some anticonvulsant effects in certain seizure models, 
but there have also been studies suggesting a proconvulsant 
effect.14,37 Although it is plausible that THC may contribute to the an-
ti-seizure activity reported for medical marijuana and other cannabis 
preparations, its adverse psychotropic properties37 and inconsistent 
activity in seizure models render it undesirable for development for 
the treatment of epilepsy.38 Therefore, most cannabinoid research ef-
forts in epilepsy have focused on the characterization of non-psycho-
active agents, particularly CBD and cannabidivarin (CBDV), and the 
present review will focus especially on these compounds.
CBD
In preclinical studies, CBD has been found to be active in a variety 
of seizures models, including seizures induced by maximal electro-
shock39-41 and by pentylentetrazole in rats and mice,42-44 audiogenic 
seizures in rats45 and seizures induced by 3-mercaptopropionic acid, 
bicuculline, picrotoxin, cocaine and isoniazid (but not strychnine) in 
mice.39,45,46 In addition, CBD shows protective activity in pilocarpine 
models of temporal lobe seizures and in the penicillin and cobalt 
models of focal seizures in rats,47-49 and increases the afterdischarge 
threshold while reducing afterdischarge amplitude and duration in 
electrically evoked kindled seizures in rats.50 CBD also inhibits epi-
leptiform potentials induced by a Mg2+-free medium and 4-amino-
pyridine in hippocampal brain slices.42
Recently, the anticonvulsant profile of CBD was re-evaluated using 
a refocused screening protocol developed by the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-funded Epilepsy 
Therapy Screening Program.41 In this investigation, CBD given intra-
peritoneally (i.p.) produced a dose-dependent protection against 
maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice (ED50 83.5 mg/kg) 
and rats (ED50 88.9 mg/kg), and was also found to be effective in the 
6 Hz 44 mA seizure model (ED50 164 mg/kg), and in the corneal kin-
dling model (ED50 119 mg/kg) in mice. These effects were observed 
at doses that did not cause motor impairment. No protection, how-
ever, was attained in the lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindled rat 
at doses up to 300 mg/kg.
As discussed above, the molecular actions involved in CBD an-
ti-seizure activity do not appear to be mediated by a direct effect on 
cannabinoid receptors, but the precise mechanisms of action have 
not been ascertained. In various studies, CBD has been reported to 
exhibit a range of other activities which suggest potential utility in 
many other conditions, including anxiety, mood disorders, psychosis, 
fear, trauma-related conditions, tobacco and opioid addition, in-
flammatory diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and as a tool to 
counteract the undesired psychotropic effects of THC.32,51-56 
CBDV
CBDV, another cannabinoid present in the cannabis plant, has 
been the focus of many recent studies. Like CBD, CBDV is virtually de-
void of psychoactive effects and shows protecting activity in vitro 
against epileptiform potentials induced by 4-aminopyridine and 
Mg2+- free conditions in rat hippocampal slices and, in vivo, against 
seizures induced by maximal electroshock, pentylentetrazole, and 
audiogenic stimulation.57 In an early study, CBDV was not found to 
protect against pilocarpine-induced seizures at doses up to 200 
mg/kg i.p., but potentiated the effect of valproic acid and pheno-
barbital in this model.57 In a subsequent study by the same group, 
however, inhibition of pilocarpine-induced seizures was observed af-
ter administration of a CBDV-rich cannabis extract.58 The mecha-
nisms responsible for the anti-seizure effects of CBDV do not seem to 
involve an action on cannabinoid receptors.25,29 Like CBD, CBDV acts 
as an agonist for the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels 
TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPA1, and as an antagonist for TRPM8.28,30,59 These 
actions, however, have been considered unlikely to contribute to its 
anticonvulsant activity.29,36 CBDV also inhibits diacylglycerol lipase α, 
the primary enzyme involved in the synthesis of 2-arachidono-
ylglycerol.28 Again, the potential contribution of this effect to its anti-
convulsant activity has not been established.
9-Δ-tetrahydrocannabinolinic acid 
In the cannabis plant, most cannabinoids are synthesized in their 
acidic form. These acidic cannabinoids undergo decarboxylation to 
their neutral counterparts (e.g., CBD and THC) under the influence of 
auto-oxidation, light and heat. In most common extraction and deliv-
ery methods, plant materials are exposed to heat, resulting in the 
conversion of the acidic forms to the neutral constituents.60 However, 
some cannabis products may retain some content in acidic cannabi-
noids, particularly cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and 9-Δ-tetrahydro-
cannabinolinic acid (THCA). THCA has been found to possess anti-
convulsant activity in preliminary preclinical investigations, and be

devoid of adverse psychoactive effects.61 Interest in THCA been re-
kindled recently by the fact that it is sometimes used for anti-seizure 
purposes in the USA, where it can be more readily available and/or 
affordable than CBD. One specific concern is that accidental ex-
posure to heat of artisanal THCA preparations may result in partial 
conversion to THC.61
Pharmacokinetics and drug interactions
CBD
Following administration to healthy subjects of a single 400 mg or-
al dose encapsulated in gelatin capsules, CBD was found to be rap-
idly absorbed, with mean peak plasma concentrations of 114 to 181 
ng/mL being attained at about 1.5 to 3 hours.62 Following oral ad-
ministration, CBD shows a high interindividual pharmacokinetic 
variability. Its oral bioavailability is low, in the order of 6%37 or 
10%,63 due in part to extensive first-pass metabolism.37 Bioavail-
ability appears to be higher (in the range of 11 to 45%) after in-
halation in cannabis smokers.64 In a study conducted with an or-
omucosal spray of nabiximols (a formulation containing THC and 
CBD in an approximately 1:1 ratio, which is approved in some coun-
tries for the treatment of symptoms of spasticity associated with mul-
tiple sclerosis), co-administration with food resulted in a mean 5-fold 
increase in CBD bioavailability.65 It is unclear whether a similar effect 
also occurs with oral formulations.  
CBD is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%)63 and is ex-
tensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, partic-
ularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19,66 and glucuronyltransferases.67 The 
major metabolic pathway involves hydroxylation and oxidation at 
C-7, followed by further hydroxylation in the pentyl and propenyl 
groups.68 The major oxidized metabolite identified is cannabi-
diol-7-oic acid containing a hydroxyethyl side chain. The elimination 
of CBD follows a biphasic pattern, with an initial half-life of about 6 
hours which partly reflects distributive processes. Because of its very 
high lipophilic properties, CBD distributes extensively into tissues, 
from which it is slowly released, resulting in a late-phase terminal 
half-life of about 24 hours.63 In a safety and pharmacokinetic study in 
patients with Dravet syndrome, 27 children aged 4 to 10 years re-
ceived CBD doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/day in addition to pre-exist-
ing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).69 On treatment day 22, exposures 
to CBD and its major metabolites were found to increase 
dose-proportionally.
The clearance of CBD has been reported to be increased after 
co-administration with the enzyme inducer rifampicin.70 It would be 
expected that enzyme inducing AEDs such as carbamazepine and 
phenytoin also accelerate CBD metabolism and reduce CBD levels at 
steady state. Conversely, CBD levels have been found to be increased 
by the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, but not by the CYP2C19 in-
hibitor omeprazole.70
In studies conducted on liver isozymes, CBD has been shown to in-
hibit the activity of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, 
and CYP2C19 enzymes.71-75 There is also evidence of CBD acting as 
an inhibitor of transporter systems, such as BCRP and the ABC trans-
porter multidrug resistance-related protein 1.67 Some of these in vitro 
effects occur at concentrations above those found within the clin-
ically used dose range. However, at least one clinically important in-
teraction mediated by inhibition of drug metabolism has been 
reported. In a group of 13 patients with epilepsy aged 4 to 19 years, 
addition of CBD (initial dose 5 mg/kg/day, titrated up to a target dose 
of 25 mg/ kg/day) resulted in an increase in the plasma levels of con-
comitantly administered clobazam by 60 ± 80% (mean ± standard 
deviation). More importantly, the plasma concentration of the active 
metabolite of clobazam, N-desmethyl-clobazam, increased by 
500 ± 300% (95% confidence interval [CI]: +90 to +610%) at 
4 weeks after starting CBD.76 Ten of the 13 patients experienced side 
effects, most commonly drowsiness, which resolved after lowering 
the clobazam dose. This interaction, which was considered to be 
mediated by inhibition of CYP2C19, is particularly relevant because 
clobazam is frequently used in epileptic encephalopathies for which 
CBD appears to be a promising new treatment. In a safety and phar-
macokinetic study in children with Dravet syndrome, there were mini-
mal changes in clobazam levels, but concentrations of N-desmethyl 
clobazam increased independently of CBD dose, except for patients 
on stiripentol in whom N-desmethyl-clobazam levels appeared to be 
unaffected by CBD.69 There were no demonstrable effects on other 
AEDs (valproic acid, topiramate, stiripentol, levetiracetam).69 Serum 
levels of concomitant AEDs were also measured in another study 
which assessed 39 adults and 42 children started on CBD at a dose 
of 5 mg/kg/day, increased according to clinical response up to a max-
imum of 50 mg/kg/day.77 In the latter study, increases in the levels of 
N-desmethyl-clobazam, topiramate, and rufinamide were reported 
with increasing CBD doses. In adults, there were also increases in se-
rum levels of zonisamide and eslicarbazepine. The results of this 
study are difficult to interpret, because of the confounding effects of 
changes in the dose of comedications. Serum clobazam levels, for ex-
ample, decreased during CBD coadministration, primarily due to a re-
 66 Journal of Epilepsy Research Vol. 7, No. 2, 2017

duction in clobazam dose. In any case, assessment of the data sug-
gested that changes in serum levels of concomitant AEDs during CBD 
administration were generally minor, with the exception of clobazam 
and N-desmethylclobazam levels.77 In fact, occurrence of sedation as 
a result of the interaction with clobazam often led to a decrease in 
clobazam dose.
CBD may also be involved in pharmacodynamic interactions, i.e. 
interactions which occur at the site of action. In particular, acutely ad-
ministered CBD may antagonize some of the effects of THC at CB1 
receptor sites,78-80 an observation which may explain why patients 
taking marijuana with higher CBD content are less likely to develop 
adverse THC-related psychotropic symptoms, and may tolerate high-
ecr THC doses.37,81 Studies in animal models, however, suggest that 
after prolonged exposure molecular interactions between CBD and 
THC may be more complex than previously thought, and may involve 
superadditive effects on some measures.82 Terpenoids contained in 
cannabis extracts may also interact with the action of CBD and other 
cannabinoids.83
The observation has been made that elevations in liver enzymes 
associated with CBD treatment occur much more frequently among 
patients comedicated with valproate than among patients come-
dicated with other AEDs.77,84-86 It is unclear whether the mechanism 
underlying this interaction is pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic 
in nature.87 
CBDV
The pharmacokinetics of CBDV have not been reported in detail. In 
a recently completed Phase I study, healthy subjects were given sin-
gle oral doses ranging between 25 and 800 mg, as well as multiple 
doses of 800 mg once daily over 5 days.36 Peak plasma concen-
trations and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve were 
found to be dose proportional. The 7-hydroxy- and 6-hydroxy-metab-
olites could be detected shortly after dosing. 
Clinical evidence of efficacy and safety: 
exploratory studies 
Marijuana and oral cannabis extracts
As discussed in the introductory section of this article, evidence of 
cannabis being used in the treatment of seizure disorders dates back 
thousands of years, and cannabis preparations had a role in the 
treatment of epilepsy by neurologists in the late nineteenth century. 
Although use of cannabis in epilepsy declined in the twentieth cen-
tury due to legal restrictions and the gradual introduction of AEDs, 
observations suggesting anti-seizure activity continued to be 
reported. In 1975, Consroe et al.88 described a 24-year-old patient 
with seizures uncontrolled despite therapy with phenobarbital and 
phenytoin, who became seizure-free after starting to smoke 
marijuana. A few other reports suggestive of beneficial effects on 
seizures of marijuana smoking appeared in the subsequent deca-
des,89-92 including an interesting epidemiological study which found 
a reduced risk of a first seizure among illicit cannabis users.93 There 
have been however, also reports of marijuana smoking precipitating 
or aggravating seizures.94,95
For medicinal use, oral intake provides a more easily controllable 
route of drug delivery than inhalation. Therefore, particularly during 
the last twenty years, users of cannabis for seizure control have gen-
erally preferred oral preparations. At the same time, increasing real-
ization that CBD is superior to THC in safety and potential anti-seiz-
ure activity has resulted in preferential use of whole plant prepara-
tions or cannabis-based oil or liquid extracts enriched in CBD 
content. A number of such products are accessible in many countries 
and states under widely different legal and regulatory scenarios.87,96 
In some settings, users obtain their cannabis from local growers, pur-
chase it online or they grow the plant and process the product 
themselves.61 Therefore, it is not surprising that many preparations 
lack adequate quality validation, and that some marketed products 
when tested are found to have contents of individual cannabinoids 
wildly different from those stated in their label,97,98 and some may 
even contain potentially harmful contaminants .99 This situation rais-
es concerns about consistency in dosing and risk of adverse effects, 
including toxic effects resulting from psychoactive constituents such 
as THC. In this regard, a recent report described two children with 
manifestations suggestive of THC intoxication, including seizure ex-
acerbation, in whom clinical symptoms remitted after switching their 
treatment from a CBD-enriched edible cannabis preparation to a for-
mulation of purified CBD.100 In some countries, well standardized 
products are accessible, which typically differ in their relative content 
of CBD and THC. In Israel, for example, available medical cannabis 
products approved for epilepsy have standardized CBD/THC ratios of 
2:1, 5:1, and 20:1, with the latter being the preparation most com-
monly used.101 
Evidence about the efficacy and safety of oral cannabis prepara-
tions is mostly based on surveys and case reports, including the wide-
ly publicized story of Charlotte, a little girl with SCN1A-confirmed 
Dravet syndrome, who experienced a remarkable improvement in her

seizures after being switched to a CBD-enriched extract.102 One of 
the first surveys targeted a Facebook group of approximately 150 pa-
rents in the USA supporting the use of CBD-enriched cannabis in 
their children with drug refractory seizures.103 There were only 19 re-
spondents, with most of the children having a diagnosis of Dravet 
syndrome and Doose syndrome. Over 80% of parents in this small 
and possibly biased sample considered their child to have fewer seiz-
ures while on CBD-enriched cannabis, at estimated doses up to 25 
mg/kg/day for CBD and up to 0.8 mg/kg/day for THC. Two children 
were free from seizures. Parents also reported other beneficial ef-
fects, including improved alertness, and improved mood and sleep. 
Side effects included drowsiness and fatigue. Another online survey 
was directed to parents who used CBD-enriched cannabis products 
for the treatment of their children’s epilepsy.104 There were 117 re-
spondents (including parents of 53 children with infantile spasms 
and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), with 85% reporting a reduction in 
seizure frequency in their children, and 14% reporting complete seiz-
ure freedom. The median duration of therapy was 6.8 months, and 
the median estimated CBD dosage was 4.3 mg/kg/day. Many res-
ponders reported that their children showed improved sleep, alert-
ness and mood. In a very recent web-based survey from Australia tar-
geting people with epilepsy nationwide, 137 of the 976 respondents 
reported to be using, or having previously used, cannabis products 
for the treatment of their seizures.105 Use of these products increased 
with increasing number of AEDs used in the past, suggesting that pa-
tients with the most drug resistant seizures were more likely to ac-
cess cannabis therapy. Products were perceived as helpful in manag-
ing seizures in 71% of children and 89.5% of adults, and almost one 
half of respondents reported to have been able to reduce their con-
comitant AEDs. Interestingly, only 6.5% of responders stated that 
they used cannabis because it was recommended by their physician, 
and the majority of the products used were obtained from illegal sup-
pliers, without knowledge of their precise composition. Positive re-
sults with cannabis use were also reported in another recent online 
survey directed to parents of children with refractory epilepsy in 
Mexico.106
In addition to web-based surveys, there have several reports based 
on chart reviews. In one such report from the USA, use of artisanal 
cannabis in 272 children and adults with a variety of seizure types 
was associated with at least 50% seizure reduction in 55% of cases, 
with 10% achieving seizure freedom, and there was no indication of 
improvement being preferentially associated with a specific seizure 
type or syndrome.61 In a retrospective survey of 75 children and ado-
lescents with refractory epilepsy from Colorado, where use marijuana 
for medical purposes was legalized in 2,000, one third of patients ex-
perienced a > 50% seizure reduction after starting therapy with oral 
cannabis, with the highest apparent benefit being reported in those 
with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.107 Adverse events were reported in 
almost one half of the cases and included increased seizures (13%) 
and somnolence/fatigue (12%), but there were also reports of im-
proved alertness or behavior in one third of the cases. Comparable 
findings were reported in a similar report from Colorado, which in-
cluded data from 119 patients (it is unclear whether this population 
partly overlapped with that described in the earlier report by the 
same group).108 In the latter study, the proportion of patients who 
showed >50% seizure reduction was 24% and, interestingly, one 
third of those who did not report any seizure improvement continued 
to take cannabis therapy, presumably because of other perceived 
benefits. The average duration of cannabis use in this cohort was 
11.7 months (range 0.3 to 57 months) and overall 71% of patients 
discontinued cannabis therapy during the study period. Another re-
port from Israel included 74 patients with highly drug resistant epi-
lepsies secondary to various etiologies (mostly epileptic encephalo-
pathies), treated with a CBD dose of 1 to 20 mg/kg/day using an oil 
product containing CBD and THC in a 20:1 ratio.109 Almost 90% of 
the patients were cognitively impaired and one half were less than 
10 years of age. Unlike other studies, therapy in the Israeli setting 
was generally prescribed by a physician, and the fact that 81% of the 
patients received relatively low doses (less than 10 mg/kg/day) was 
attributed to the fact that most patients kept the oil drops sub-
lingually for several minutes, which would be expected to result in 
higher bioavailability.102 About one half of the patients reported at 
least a 50% reduction of their seizures, but five reported seizure ag-
gravation leading to treatment withdrawal. As in previous reports, 
many patients reported improvements in behavior, alertness, lan-
guage, communication, motor skills and sleep. Thirty-four (45%) pa-
tients reported adverse events, including somnolence/fatigue (22%), 
seizure aggravation (18%), gastrointestinal symptoms and irritability 
(7%). 
Overall, review of the available studies suggests that CBD-en-
riched cannabis may have anti-seizure effects, but the quality of the 
evidence does not allow to draw firm conclusions. Studies were gen-
erally retrospective, and based on patient or parenteral reports with-
out adequately structured data collection. Many of the patients sur-
veyed used unspecified products whose composition and dosage 
was unknown. Moreover, estimates of apparent efficacy could be af-

fected by patients’ selection bias, reporting bias, and other con-
founders such as the natural course of the disease, regression to the 
mean phenomena, and placebo effects.110 In particular, placebo ef-
fects are known to be strongly influenced by expectations,111 and the 
broad media exposure associated with cannabis products is a strong 
generator of positive expectations. An indication that patient or pa-
rental expectations may have a strong impact on the outcome of can-
nabis treatment is provided by a comparison of perceived improve-
ment among patients included in the Colorado surveys.107,108 
Specifically, outcomes of cannabis therapy were significantly better 
when families moved their residence to Colorado in order to access 
the medication compared with families already residing in Colorado 
(Fig. 3). Although there could be alternative explanations for this 
finding, it is plausible that patients with high expectations/mo-
tivations, leading them to relocate to another state, were those who 
responded best.
Purified cannabidiol
The first studies of pure CBD in the treatment of drug-resistant epi-
lepsy date back to the late 70s and the 80s and explored oral doses 
in the range of 200 to 300 mg/day.112-115 Despite the fact that all four 
studies included placebo as a control, only one trial was truly dou-
ble-blind, the largest sample size was only 15 patients, critical details 
were lacking, and there were other methodological shortcomings.37 
These trials were evaluated in a Cochrane review which included a 
systematic literature search up to September 2013, and the con-
clusion was reached that ‘no reliable conclusions can be drawn at 
present regarding the efficacy of cannabinoids as a treatment for epi-
lepsy’.116 Similar conclusions were reached in a 2014 report of the 
Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of 
Neurology.117 
To date, the largest exploratory study of the tolerability and an-
ti-seizure activity of CBD relates to a recent physician-sponsored ex-
panded-access programme at 11 epilepsy centres in the USA.84 A to-
tal of 214 patients aged 1-30 years with severe, childhood-onset, 
drug resistant epilepsy received an oil-based liquid formulation of 
99% pure CBD at an initial dose of 2-5 mg/kg/day, up-titrated until 
intolerance or to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg per day, 
depending on study site. Tolerability and safety were analysed for the 
group of 162 patients who achieved at least 12 weeks of follow-up–
this included 33 patients with Dravet syndrome and 31 patients with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In this group, adverse events were re-
ported in 128 (79%) patients, the most common being somnolence 
(25%), decreased appetite (19%), diarrhea (19%), fatigue (13%), 
and convulsion (11%). Adverse events leading to discontinuation of 
treatment occurred in 5 patients (3%). An explorative assessment of 
efficacy was performed in a subgroup of 137 patients, after excluding 
patients with less than 12-week follow-up (n = 52), patients with no 
motor seizures (n = 21), and patients who were aged less than one 
year or had a severe progressive metabolic disease (n = 3). In those 
137 patients, there was a median 35% decrease in total seizures, 
with the greatest seizure reduction being recorded in patients with 
focal seizures (-55%, n = 42) and atonic seizures (-54%, n = 32). 
Nine patients (7%) were free from all seizures during the last 4 
weeks of follow-up. It is of interest that a reduction in motor seizures 
by 50% or greater was observed in 51% of patients comedicated 
with clobazam (n = 70), compared with 27% of those not receiving 
clobazam (n = 67). Patients on clobazam, however, were also more 
likely to develop adverse effects, particularly somnolence and fatigue. 
These differences in outcome in relation to type of comedication may 
be explained by the increase in plasma clobazam and N-desmethyl-
clobazam levels caused by CBD.76 Additional analyses in the efficacy 
patient set showed that patients with Dravet syndrome (n = 32) had 
a 43% median reduction in all seizures, whereas for patients with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 30) median reduction in total seiz-
ures was 36%. In a subgroup of children evaluated with a care-
giver-filled quality of life questionnaire, CBD therapy was associated 
with improved scores for energy/fatigue, memory, control/help-
lessness, other cognitive functions, social interactions, behavior, and 
global quality of life, which did not correlate with changes in seizure 
frequency.118 Outcome data from a larger cohort of 261 children and

young adults from the same program (including 44 with Dravet syn-
drome and 40 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) have also been re-
ported in summary form.36 Convulsive seizure rate for the whole co-
hort decreased by a median of 48% compared with baseline, where-
as atonic seizures in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome de-
creased by 71.1%. Overall, the main value of these studies is in pro-
viding a preliminary characterization of CBD safety profile. Data con-
cerning improvement in seizure control, however, are difficult to as-
sess in view of the uncontrolled nature of the observations.
Smaller uncontrolled studies and case reports have also suggested 
that CBD could be of value in the treatment of patients with drug re-
sistant seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex,119,120 fe-
brile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES),121 Sturge-Weber 
syndrome122 and malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy.123
Well controlled randomized trials 
The recent flurry of research focused on the potential usefulness of 
cannabinoids in epilepsy has resulted in the completion of three well 
controlled randomized trials, all of which evaluated a liquid propri-
etary oral formulation of CBD.85,86,124 Of these trials, only one has 
been published in detail.85 
Double-blind trial in Dravet syndrome
As an indication of the high interest of the medical community in 
the application of cannabinoids to epilepsy management, the first 
randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial of CBD in Dravet 
syndrome was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 
May 2017.85 In this trial, conducted at 23 centers in the USA and 
Europe, 120 patients with an established diagnosis of Dravet syn-
drome (mean age 9.8 years, range 2.3 to 18.4 years) were random-
ized to receive placebo or 20 mg/kg/day CBD in two divided daily 
administrations. All patients had at least 4 convulsive seizures during 
a preceding 4-week baseline, and CBD or placebo were added on to 
pre-existing medications, which included clobazam in 65% of cases. 
The duration of treatment was 14 weeks, including a 2-week-titra-
tion phase. Compared with baseline, the median monthly frequency 
of convulsive seizures (defined as the sum of tonic-clonic, tonic, clon-
ic, and atonic seizures) decreased from 12.4 to 5.9 in the CBD group, 
and from 14.9 to 14.1 in the placebo group. Median percent changes 
in seizure frequency are shown in Fig. 4. The adjusted median differ-
ence in change in seizure frequency between the CBD and the place-
bo group (primary endpoint) was -22.8% (95% CI: -41.1 to -5.4, p = 
0.01). The proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in convulsive 
seizures frequency was 43% in the CBD group compared with 27% 
in the placebo group. Non-convulsive seizures were not significantly 
affected by CBD therapy. Three patients (5%) became seizure-free 
during the treatment period in the CBD group, compared with none 
in the placebo group. 
Adverse events deemed to be related to the study treatment were 
reported in 75% of patients in the CBD group and 36% of those in 
the placebo group. Somnolence, diarrhea, and decreased appetite 
were the most common CBD-associated adverse events (Table 2). 
Eighteen of the 22 CBD-treated patients who developed somnolence 
were on clobazam comedication. Adverse events appeared mostly 
during the first two weeks of therapy, and there were instances in 
which the dose of CBD or other medications were reduced. No in-
formation, however, was reported on how often the dose of con-
comitant clobazam was reduced. Eight patients in the CBD group dis-
continued the trial prematurely due to adverse events (in three cases, 
marked elevation of liver enzymes), compared with one patient in the 
placebo group who also had a marked elevation in liver enzymes. 
Overall, elevated aminotransferases levels occurred in 12 patients in 
the CBD group and one in the placebo group, all of whom were on 
concomitant valproate therapy. In the nine patients with raised ami-
notransferases who did not discontinued treatment, liver enzymes 
reverted to normal on continuation of therapy.

in patients with Dravet syndrome85 
Overall, this trial provides for the first time robust evidence that 
CBD added-on to pre-existing AED treatment reduces the frequency 
of convulsive seizures in children and young adults with Dravet 
syndrome. The data also emphasize the need for caution in interpret-
ing results from previous uncontrolled trials–although median con-
vulsive seizure frequency (primary endpoint) decreased by a statisti-
cally significantly greater extent in the CBD group compared with the 
placebo group, the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in 
convulsive seizure frequency did not differ significantly between 
groups, and more than one quarter of patients allocated to placebo 
had their seizure frequency reduced by one-half or more during the 
trial. Interestingly, no significant differences between groups were 
found in sleep scores, behavioral adaptation (Vineland-II) scores, and 
Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy scores, even though duration of 
treatment was relatively short and possibly insufficient to determine 
changes in these parameters. A major weakness in the presentation 
of the trial results is the failure to report changes in plasma concen-
trations of concomitant AEDs and, most notably, clobazam and 
N-desmethylclobazam. In view of the fact that 66% of patients in the 
CBD group were on clobazam comedication, and evidence from a 
previous study indicating that N-desmethylclobazam levels increase 
by 500% on average after adding CBD,76 the reported data do not al-
low to determine whether the reported improvement in seizure fre-
quency can be ascribed to a direct action of CBD, or is simply a con-
sequence of increased plasma levels of comedication.
Double-blind trials in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
Two well controlled double-blind trials in patients with Len-
nox-Gastaut syndrome have been completed, but results to date 
have only been reported in summary form.86,124 
In the first trial, 171 patients (mean age 15 years) with uncon-
trolled drop seizures (median baseline monthly frequency 74) were 
randomized to receive adjunctive treatment with CBD oral solution 
20 mg/kg/day or placebo for a period of 14 weeks (2-week titration 
and 12-week maintenance).86 Fourteen patients (16%) in the CBD 
group and one patient (1%) in the placebo group withdrew 
prematurely. Compared with placebo, CBD treatment was associated 
with a greater median percent reduction in monthly drop seizures 
(44% vs. 22%; p = 0.0135, Fig. 4) and a greater proportion of pa-
tients with a ≥ 50% seizure reduction (44% vs. 24%; p = 0.0043). 
Adverse events were reported in 86% of CBD and 69% of placebo 
patients, the most common being diarrhoea, somnolence, pyrexia, 
decreased appetite, and vomiting. Treatment-related serious adverse 
events were reported in nine CBD patients and one placebo patient. 
Elevations in transaminases occurred mostly in patients on con-
comitant valproate therapy and all resolved.
In the second trial, 225 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
(mean age 16 years, median number of drop seizures per month at 
baseline 85) were randomised to three groups and allocated to two 
doses of CBD (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) or placebo.124 Enrolled patients 
were receiving a median of 3 concomitant AEDs. Duration of the trial 
was 14 weeks (2-week titration and 12-week maintenance). The re-
duction in monthly frequency of drop seizures was significantly great-
er in the CBD 20 mg/kg group (42%) and 10 mg/kg group (37%) 
than in the placebo group (17%; p = 0.0047 and 0.0016, re-
spectively, Fig. 4). The proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease 
in drop seizure frequency was also significantly greater in the 20 and 
10 mg/kg groups (40% and 36%, respectively) than in the placebo 
group (15%; p = 0.0006 and p = 0.0030, respectively). Total seiz-
ures were also significantly reduced in both CBD groups compared 
with placebo. Adverse events were reported in 94% of patients allo-
cated to 20 mg/kg, 84% of those allocated to 10 mg/kg, and 72% of 
 Emilio Perucca. Cannabinoids for Epilepsy 71

placebo patients, the most common being somnolence and de-
creased appetite. Serious treatment‑related adverse events occurred 
in five patients in the 20 mg/kg group, two patients in the10 mg/kg 
group, and no patients on placebo patients. Some elevations in trans-
aminases were seen. Of 212 completers, 99% entered an open-label 
extension study.
Overall the results of these trials demonstrate that at dosages of 
10 to 20 mg/kg/day CBD is superior to placebo in reducing the fre-
quency of drop seizures in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. 
Published reports, however, provide no information on concomitant 
therapies, and most notably whether, and to what extent, the clinical 
improvement on CBD therapy could be related to elevation in serum 
concentrations of other medications, most notably clobazam and 
N-desmethylclobazam.
Conclusions and future perspectives
The interest in cannabis preparations in the treatment of epi-
lepsies, particularly drug refractory childhood epilepsies, has sky-
rocketed in recent years. Marijuana and other cannabis products with 
moderate to high THC content utilized primarily for recreational pur-
poses are generally unsuitable for this indication, not only because 
evidence for an anti-seizure activity of THC is equivocal and risk of 
seizure aggravation cannot be excluded,101 but also because THC is 
associated with many undesired effects, including addiction liability, 
psychiatric disorders, cognitive and motor impairment125-127 and, 
possibly, also cardiovascular toxicity.128 The maturing brain is also 
more vulnerable to the adverse of effects of marijuana,126,129,130 and 
there is evidence of THC impairing structural and functional con-
nectivity during brain development.126,129,130 Discontinuation of THC 
after prolonged exposure can also lead to withdrawal manifes-
tations131,132 and cases have been reported of seizure exacerbation 
after marijuana cessation in people with epilepsy.133
Compared with THC, CBD shows a better defined anticonvulsant 
profile in animal models considered to be predictive of efficacy 
against focal and generalized seizures. Moreover, CBD is largely de-
void of adverse psychoactive effects, and is considered to lack the 
abuse liability associated with THC-containing products.134 In the last 
decade, this has led to an increasing use of CBD-enriched extracts as 
a potential treatment for epilepsy, particularly in children. 
Improvement in seizure control, often associated with additional 
benefits on sleep and behaviour, have been reported in a sizeable 
proportion of cases,87 but interpretation of these data is made diffi-
cult by the uncontrolled nature of the observations. Additionally, as 
discussed in this article, there are concerns about the quality and var-
iability of many of the products used,98 particularly because cannabis 
treatment is often initiated spontaneously by patients or caregivers 
without adequate medical supervision.105
Evidence concerning the potential anti-seizure efficacy of cannabi-
noids reached a turning point in the last 12 months, with the com-
pletion of the first high-quality placebo-controlled trials of a purified 
oil-based liquid CBD preparation in patients with Dravet syndrome 
and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.85,86,124 The results of these studies 
demonstrate that, at a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day, CBD added on to 
pre-existing AED treatment is superior to placebo in reducing the fre-
quency of convulsive (tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, and atonic) seizures 
in patients with Dravet syndrome, and the frequency of drop seizures 
in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In the latter patients, a 
dosage of 10 mg/kg/day treatment was also superior to placebo. 
Therefore there is now for the first time class 1 evidence that CBD im-
proves seizure control when added on to other AEDs in patients with 
two difficult-to-treat epileptic encephalopathies. Available data, 
however, do not allow to conclude that CBD per se has anti-seizure 
activity. At least for the trial published in full,85 a majority of patients 
were receiving concomitant clobazam therapy, and it is unclear 
whether the reported seizure benefits, as well as adverse effects, 
were related to a direct action of CBD, or were mediated by a pre-
viously described 5-fold elevation in plasma N-desmethylclobazam 
levels. For the two studies in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the pro-
portion of patients on concomitant clobazam therapy was not re-
ported, but it is likely to have been significant because clobazam is a 
frequently used comedication in patients with this syndrome. 
Clarification of the independent effects of CBD would require re-as-
sessment of trial data for the subgroup of patients not comedicated 
with clobazam, or the conduction of further studies after excluding 
such patients or, alternatively, adjusting blindly clobazam dosages to 
maintain unaltered concentration of N-desmethylclobazam. Additio-
nal well controlled studies are also desirable to determine the poten-
tial value of CBD in other seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, in-
cluding refractory focal epilepsies.
One of the reasons for the utilization of cannabis products to have 
become so popular among patients and their caregivers is that these 
products are generally regarded as causing fewer adverse effects 
compared with traditional AEDs, partly out of the misperception that 
remedies derived from natural products are unlikely to be harmful. In 
a survey carried out by Epilepsia, 96% of respondents among the 
 72 Journal of Epilepsy Research Vol. 7, No. 2, 2017

general public felt that there was sufficient safety evidence about 
cannabis products, whereas only 34% of physicians considered this 
to be the case.135 In fact, in the randomized controlled trials con-
ducted to date the tolerability profile of CDB was relatively benign, 
with somnolence, decreased appetite and gastrointestinal symptoms 
being the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. 
Although these results are encouraging, further studies are required 
to evaluate the safety profile of CBD and other cannabis products in 
greater detail, particularly after long-term exposure and whenever 
these products are used in subpopulations potentially at risk. 
Elevations of liver enzymes have been frequently observed, especially 
in patients comedicated with valproate, and although they were gen-
erally reversible, close observation for signs suggestive of hepatic 
toxicity is advisable. Nabiximols, an oromucosal spray formulation 
containing approximately equal amounts of THC and CBD, has been 
commercially available in several countries for a number of years and 
has a relatively extensive safety record.68 However, the maximum ap-
proved daily CBD dose in nabiximols is considerably lower than the 
CBD doses used in epilepsy trials, and experience of nabiximols in pe-
diatric age is limited because the product is not recommended for 
use ‘below 18 years of age due to lack of safety and efficacy data’.68 
As discussed above, prolonged exposure of the immature brain to 
THC has been shown to cause deleterious effects on brain con-
nectivity, and there is some evidence of prolonged recreational use of 
marijuana in adolescence being associated with neuropsychological 
decline and lower academic performance scores.136,137 There are also 
special concerns for risks to the offspring of mothers who use mar-
ijuana during pregnancy.138,139 Although these findings may be spe-
cific for THC and other psychoactive cannabinoids, adequate safety 
data for young children exposed to long-term CBD therapy are not 
yet available.24 Another area where limited data is available relates 
to the risk of rebound seizures following abrupt or rapid discontinua-
tion of treatment. Unlike THC, CBD is not associated with the devel-
opment of tolerance after repeated administration in various seizure 
models, and there is no evidence of a withdrawal syndrome develop-
ing after CBD discontinuation.12
These are exciting times for research in cannabinoids. After almost 
four millennia of their documented medical use in the treatment of 
seizure disorders, we are very close to obtaining conclusive evidence 
of their efficacy in some severe epilepsy syndromes. The era of evi-
dence-based prescription of a cannabis product is within our sight.
