Abstract
Background: Previous research has reported that sexual harassment can lead to reduced mental health. Few
studies have focused on sexual harassment conducted by clients or customers, which might occur in person-
related occupations such as eldercare work, social work or customer service work. This study examined the cross-
sectional association between sexual harassment by clients or customers and depressive symptoms. We also
examined if this association was different compared to sexual harassment conducted by a colleague, supervisor
or subordinate. Further, we investigated if psychosocial workplace initiatives modified the association between
sexual harassment by clients or customers and level of depressive symptoms.
Methods: We used data from the Work Environment and Health in Denmark cohort study (WEHD) and the Work
Environment Activities in Danish Workplaces Study (WEADW) collected in 2012. WEHD is based on a random
sample of employed individuals aged 18–64. In WEADW, organizational supervisors or employee representatives
provided information on workplace characteristics. By combining WEHD and WEADW we included self-reported
information on working conditions and health from 7603 employees and supervisors in 1041 organizations within
5 occupations. Data were analyzed using multilevel regression and analyses adjusted for gender, age, occupation
and socioeconomic position.
Results: Exposure to workplace sexual harassment from clients or customers was statistically significantly associated
with a higher level of depressive symptoms (2.05; 95% CI: 0.98–3.12) compared to no exposure. Employees harassed by
colleagues, supervisors or subordinates had a higher mean level of depressive symptoms (2.45; 95% CI: 0.57–4.34) than
employees harassed by clients or customers. We observed no statistically significant interactions between harassment
from clients and customers and any of the examined psychosocial workplace initiatives (all p > 0.05).

Conclusions: The association between sexual harassment and depressive symptoms differed for employees harassed
by clients or customers and those harassed by colleagues, supervisors or subordinates. The results underline the
importance of investigating sexual harassment from clients or customers and sexual harassment by colleagues,
supervisors or subordinates as distinct types of harassment. We found no modification of the association between
sexual harassment by clients or customers and depressive symptoms by any of the examined psychosocial workplace
initiatives.

Background
According to the EU Directive of 2006, [1] sexual harass-
ment is any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual nature which occurs with the
purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in
particular
when
creating
an
intimidating,
hostile,
degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. Sexual
harassment is a gendered phenomenon as women are
more likely to be exposed compared to men. A survey
among Danish employees shows that 5.1% of women aged
18–64 years have been exposed to sexual harassment
compared to 1.2% of men [2]. The same survey also
showed that the prevalence was higher among employees
working in health care: the prevalence of sexual harass-
ment across all jobs was 3.1%, and for health care workers
it was 16.4% [2]. Another study of 8064 Danish employees
showed that in the health care sector, sexual offensive
behaviors at work were 3.5 times more often reported
than the national average of all other jobs [3, 4]. Among
health care workers, sexual harassment is most often con-
ducted by clients or customers [3, 5, 6].
Research reports that workplace sexual harassment
has negative consequences such as decreased job satis-
faction, long-term sickness absence, and mental health
problems such as depression and anxiety [7–11]. One of
the most commonly studied consequences of sexual
harassment is its effects on mental health [7, 11]. Most
research
has
focused
on
sexual
harassment
from
colleagues, supervisors or subordinates while sexual har-
assment conducted by clients or customers has received
limited interest, despite studies showing such harassment
is frequent [12–16]. Small studies of occupation-specific
samples find associations between sexual harassment
by clients or customers and adverse mental health con-
ditions including depression and burnout [13, 17–21]
but there is a paucity of larger cross-occupational
studies in the field. A reason for the limited interest in
sexual harassment from clients or customers may be
that organizations may normalize and neglect the
seriousness of this act [3, 7, 22]. At some workplaces
there is a tendency to consider sexual harassment from
clients or customers as a part of the job and not as a
potentially harmful experience [3, 22]
Sexual harassment by clients or customers
Sexual harassment conducted by clients or customers may
occur in person-related occupations, i.e. jobs that require
interactions with clients or customers [23, 24]. Examples
of person-related work include care work - caring for
individuals who are elderly, ill, or disabled - social work,
and customer service work. Harassment conducted by
clients or customers may differ from sexual harassment
conducted by colleagues, supervisors or subordinates.
Employees in person-related professions may have to navi-
gate between their own perception of unacceptable behav-
ior and an organizational expectation that it is part of
professional competency to manage difficult clients or
customers [3, 22, 25–27]. Often it is not well defined in
the organization what kinds of behavior are to be accepted
[3, 22, 28–30]. Literature indicates that organizations may
refrain from explicitly taking on the responsibility for
making
guidelines
and
policies
regarding
sexual
harassment from clients and customers [3, 22, 28–30].
Consequently, the responsibility of setting boundaries and
evaluating the behavior of a client or customer to
determine if the behavior is acceptable or not is left to
individual employees [25]. In recent years there has been a
gradual change in the conception of professional practice
in person-related jobs [3, 23, 24]. With respect to
employees working with institutionalized clients, there is
an increasing emphasis of the client’s self-determination
[3, 27]. The sexual needs of clients should not be ignored
or rejected but accepted and thus a practice is constituted
where the professional may potentially harm the client by
ignoring of sexual utterances [3, 22, 27]. Also sexual
harassment in person-related professions may often be
explained by client dementia or cognitive impairment,
[25, 27, 31] making the organization conclude that the
harassment is unintended and thus unharmful. In this
way sexual harassment by clients might be normalized
as an inevitable working condition and not as sexual
harassment [22]. This normalization may not occur if the
perpetrator is a colleague, supervisor or a subordinate.
In person-related professions, it may be difficult to
distinguish between inappropriate sexual behavior from
clients and work-related responsibilities. With intimate
care sometimes being part of work-related responsibilities,
Friborg et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:675 
Page 2 of 12
 employees are more likely to be confronted with aspects re-
lated to sexuality and sexual needs of the patients, e.g. if the
patient gets an erection during bathing. It may, in many sit-
uations, be challenging to distinguish if a client’s behavior is
acceptable or not, for instance when patients are cognitively
impaired and not able to understand the consequences of
their actions. In eldercare, employees are also often alone
with the client in his or her home making it difficult for the
employee to set boundaries. Over time, the employee may
perceive the responsibility of setting boundaries as some-
thing that strains his or her coping resources [13, 32].
Following stress theories this might result in negative
mental health outcomes such as depressive symptoms and
depression
[32–34].
Among
employees
working with
customers similar tendencies as described above may apply
[19, 35]. Employees working with customers have to
navigate in an organizational climate, where customer’s sat-
isfaction is a main priority [16, 19, 36, 37]. Thus, as with cli-
ents, sexual harassment might not be an organizational
concern but a matter of employees setting boundaries and
at the same time react on customers’ needs [3, 16, 24].
Employees in person-related professions not only
have to set boundaries. They also have to relate to
the potential risk of recurrent incidences of sexual
harassment.
Sexual
harassment
is
more
often
recurrent when conducted by clients or customers
compared
to
sexual
harassment
by
colleagues,
supervisors or subordinates [15, 38–40]. Recurrent
exposure can be explained by the specific nature of
person-related work [38]. First, the same client or
customer is likely to harass an employee more than
once, if there is a continued contact between the
employee and the client or customer, as is often the
case at hospitals, psychiatric institutions, and in the
elder care. Second, employees may experience sexual
harassment from more than one client or customer
during their career, if they stay in the same job were
the risk of exposure is higher than for the general
working population [13, 15].
The aims of this study are: First, to examine the
cross-sectional association between exposure to sexual
harassments by clients or customers and the level of
depressive
symptoms;
Second,
to
examine
if
the
association between sexual harassment and depressive
symptoms is different when the perpetrator is a client
or customer compared to a colleague, supervisor or
subordinate; Third, to examine if different psycho-
social
workplace
initiatives
(activities
to
prevent
sickness-absence, access to treatment, evaluation of
the psychosocial work environment) may modify the
association
of
sexual
harassment
by
clients
or
customers with level of depressive symptoms in a
large cross-occupational sample of 7603 employees
from Denmark.
Methods
Study design and population
Data were derived from two sources: 1) The Work
Environment and Health in Denmark cohort study
(WEHD) and 2) the Work Environment Activities in
Danish
Workplaces
Study
(WEADW).
WEHD
is
based on a random sample of employed individuals
aged
18–64.
The
study
is
designed
to
document
developments in work environment and health in the
Danish working population, and contains comprehen-
sive self-reported work environment data. Data are
collected every second year from 2012 to 2020, using
either
postal
or
web-based
questionnaires.
The
present
analyses
were
based
on
data
from
2012,
where the overall response rate was 50.8%, and there
were
7603
respondents
from
WEHD
who
were
employed within 1041 organizations participating in
WEADW.
In
the
WEADW
survey,
organizational
supervisors
or
employee
representatives
supplied
information on the organizational work environment
of the participating workplaces. The workplaces were
selected to represent a range of occupational sectors,
including building and construction, private service,
knowledge work, care work and industrial work.
For WEADW, 2040 organizations were invited to par-
ticipate and 1053 organizations responded (51.6%). A
total of 8409 (53%) employees within these organiza-
tions replied to WEHD. Each participating organization
could have up to four answers on WEADW as this
questionnaire were sent to both organizational supervi-
sors, employee representatives, work environment rep-
resentatives and owners of the organization. For the
present analyses only one answer per organization were
included with the following prioritization: 1) owners, 2)
organizational supervisors, 3) employee representatives,
4) work environment representatives, and 5) other. We
chose this hierarchical order, as we assume owners and
supervisors to have the most comprehensive knowledge
of the respective organization. Five of the responding
organizations had missing data on the psychosocial
workplace
initiatives
and
were
thus
excluded.
By
merging the two datasets, we identified 8366 employees
from 1044 organizations. We excluded employees with
missing data on any of the analyzed items (sexual
harassment, the MDI, socioeconomic status and occu-
pational group) (n = 763). The final study population
consisted of 7603 participants within 1041 organiza-
tions. Figure 1 summarizes the selection of the study
population.
Measurements
Workplace sexual harassment
Workplace sexual harassment was measured with the
following
item:
“Have
you
been
exposed
to
sexual

Page 3 of 12
 harassment at your workplace during the last 12 months?”
The response categories were “yes, daily”, “yes, weekly”,
“yes, monthly”, “yes, rarely” or “never”. The item mea-
sured perceived exposure to sexual harassment and no
definition of sexual harassment was given in the ques-
tionnaire. Participants responding “yes” were asked to
report if the perpetrator was a “colleague”, “supervisor”,
“subordinate” or “a subject not employed at the work-
place of the respondent, e.g. clients or customers”.
Given the distribution of participants, with relatively
few respondents being frequently exposed, we categorized
exposure to workplace sexual harassment as “yes, from
clients/customers” (exposed to sexual harassment and
reporting client/customer as perpetrator), “yes, from
others” (exposed to sexual harassment and reporting
colleague, supervisor or subordinate as perpetrator), or
“no” (not exposed to sexual harassment).
Depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Major
Depression Inventory (MDI) [41, 42]. The MDI includes 10
items (12 questions) that cover the ICD-10 (International
Classification of Diseases 10th revision) and DSM-IV
(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth
edition) symptoms of depression and major depression.
The items are measured in frequency, using the past
2 weeks as the time frame [41, 42]. The questions and
response categories are shown in Table 1. Responses were
scored 0–5 and summed, yielding a scale from 0 to 50, with
higher scores indicating a higher level of depressive
symptoms. For a sensitivity analysis we dichotomized

Table 1 Items of the Major Depression Inventory
Major Depression Inventory
How much of the time
1. Have you felt low in spirits or sad?
2. Have you lost interest in your daily activities?
3. Have you felt lacking in energy and strength?
4. Have you felt less self-confident?
5. Have you had a bad conscience or feelings of guilt?
6. Have you felt that life wasn’t worth living?
7. Have you had difficulty in concentrating, e.g. when reading the
newspaper or watching television?
8. Have you felt very restless?
9. Have you felt subdued or slowed down?
10. Have you had trouble sleeping at night?
11. Have you suffered from reduced appetite?
12. Have you suffered from increased appetite?
Response categories: “all the time”, “most of the time”, “slightly more than half
the time”, “slightly less than half the time”, “some of the time”, “at no time”

 the MDI scale score into probable depression or not by
the cut-off ≥20 in accordance with previous studies in-
dicating this as the most accurate cut-off score for
probable depression [43, 44]. Bech and colleagues
(2001) have validated the MDI as a measure of
depression
using
SCAN
(Schedules
for
Clinical
Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) interviews [41].
Psychosocial workplace initiatives
Psychosocial workplace initiatives were measured with
three
items:
1)
“within
the
last
year,
has
the
organization
implemented
activities
to
prevent
sickness-absence?” We dichotomized the response op-
tions into “yes” (“to a high degree”/“partly”) and “no”
(“to a low degree”/“no”/“do not know”). Organizations
answering “not relevant” were excluded from this spe-
cific analysis. 2) “Within the last year, were employees
offered health insurance to cover treatment by spe-
cialists
(physiotherapist,
psychologist
or
similar)?”
This item had four response categories, which we
combined into “yes” (“yes, offered during working
hours”/“yes, offered outside of working hours”) and
“no” (“no”/“do not know”). 3) “Within the last three
years, has the organization evaluated the psychosocial
work environment?” The question had three response
categories, which we dichotomized into “yes” (“yes”)
and “no” (“no”/“do not know”). We chose the above-
mentioned psychosocial workplace initiatives as we
expected them to potentially be able to buffer any
negative mental health consequences of sexual harass-
ment. Access to treatment by a psychologist might
for instance help employees cope with harassment.
Thus the association between harassment and depres-
sive symptoms might be weaker in workplaces that
offer access to such treatment. This would be likely
given data supporting effects of psychotherapy on de-
pression [45]. Also, organizations which evaluate their
psychosocial working conditions might be more likely
to uncover problems relating to sexual harassment
and initiate interventions to prevent and manage this
exposure.
Furthermore,
organizations
implementing
activities to prevent sickness absence might have im-
plemented initiatives dealing with sexual harassment,
if harassment was identified as a problem within the
organization. If such initiatives to manage sexual har-
assment were successful, the effects of sexual harass-
ment on employee mental health might be weakened
in organizations with such interventions compared to
organizations without such interventions.
Statistical analyses
We analyzed data using Multilevel Modeling given the
hierarchical structure of our data. In our dataset
employees (level 1) are nested within organizations
(level 2), resulting in two hierarchical levels. By using a
mixed model with random intercepts across organizations,
we accounted for correlated observations from participants
being employed in the same organization [46–48]. Allowing
the parameter determining the association between sexual
harassment and depressive symptoms to vary between
organizations (random slope model) made only negligible
changes in the results in all but one case (mentioned in
results). Therefore we report results from a fixed slope
model.
We first examined how depressive symptoms were
associated with sexual harassment from clients or
customers in an analysis comparing participants with
this exposure to participants not exposed to sexual
harassment.
We
excluded
those
harassed
by
colleagues, supervisors or subordinates. Subsequently,
we examined the mean difference in depressive symp-
tom level between participants exposed to harassment
from colleagues, supervisors or subordinates com-
pared
to
participants
harassed
by
clients
or
customers. Finally, again comparing participants har-
assed by clients or customers to non-exposed partici-
pants
and
excluding
participants
harassed
by
colleagues,
supervisors
or
subordinates,
we
tested
whether the psychosocial workplace initiatives modi-
fied the association between sexual harassment from
clients or customers and depressive symptoms. We
tested for statistical interaction (departure from addi-
tivity) between each workplace initiative and exposure
(sexual harassment from clients or customers) in their
association with depressive symptoms by including an
interaction
term
between
the
exposure
and
the
respective workplace initiative. This analysis was con-
ducted separately for each psychosocial workplace ini-
tiative.
We
adjusted
all
associations
for
potential
confounding by sex, age, socioeconomic position and
occupation, as these factors are related to depressive
symptoms [49–52] and workplace sexual harassment
[3, 8, 38, 53]. All analyses used a level of statistical
significance of P < 0.05 and P-values were calculated
using
Restricted
Maximum
Likelihood
estimation.
Data were analyzed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, NC).
Potential confounders
We derived sex and age from the participants’ civil regis-
tration number [54], while information on occupation
were derived from the job register. We classified respon-
dent’s occupation into five main groups: “Knowledge
work” (e.g. working in public administration or educa-
tion), “Private service” (e.g. working in supermarkets or
restaurants), “Care work” (e.g. working in hospitals or
residential care), “Industrial work” (e.g. working in manu-
facturing), or “Building and construction” (e.g. working in
Friborg et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:675

 bricklaying or civil engineering). The coding of subgroups
is presented in Additional file 1: Appendix 1, and is based
on the Danish version of EU’s nomenclature (NACE,
Statistical classification of economic activities in the
European Community), which is a statistical classification
of economic activities [55]. Socioeconomic status was
determined from group of occupation following the
Danish version of the International Standard Classification
of Occupations approved in 2008 (ISCO-08) [56]. This
classification organizes jobs on the basis of the skills
needed to perform them [56].
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted three sets of sensitivity analyses: First,
we tested the examined associations for care workers
only. This analysis was conducted because this article
was written as part of a project focusing especially on
sexual harassment conducted by clients, amongst care
workers. Second, we tested whether the examined as-
sociations were different if the outcome was clinical
depression instead of depressive symptoms. Third, we
conducted a gender stratified analyses, because some
previous analyses suggest that sexual harassment may
have gender specific effects [57]. Gender stratification
was not part of the main analyses of the article, be-
cause of the low number of men exposed to sexual
harassment in the sample, yielding a high level of
statistical uncertainty in this part of the analyses.
Results
Descriptive analyses
Table 2 presents the characteristics of the participants
stratified by sexual harassment from clients/ cus-
tomers and sexual harassment from colleagues/super-
visors/subordinates. The participants had a mean age
of 46 years and the largest occupational group was
care work (28.8%), whereas 24.9% were employed in
knowledge work, 17.9% in industrial work, 16.3% in
private service, and 12.0% in building and construc-
tion. Slightly more women (54.1%) than men (45.9%)
participated. Of the participants, 2.4% were exposed
to sexual harassment by clients/customers. Women
(4.1%) were more likely to be exposed than men
(0.3%). In comparison, 1.0% was exposed from col-
leagues/ supervisors/subordinates, and this exposure
was reported by 1.2% of the women, but only 0.9% of
male respondents. Participants employed in care work
were more often exposed to sexual harassment from
clients/customers (6.9%) than participants employed
in
private
service
(1.0%),
knowledge
work
(0.7%),
building and construction (0.2%), and industrial work
(0.0%). Older employees were generally less like than
younger employees to be exposed from clients/cus-
tomers. Among the participants in private service,
1.8% was exposed to harassment from colleagues/su-
pervisors/subordinates, whereas this percentage was
1.1% in industrial work, 1.1% in building and con-
struction, 0.8% in knowledge work and only 0.7% in
care work.
Association of sexual harassment and depressive
symptoms
Table 3 shows estimated differences and the P-value
of the multilevel regression analyses. Both types of
exposure to sexual harassment were associated with
an increased level of depressive symptoms. Compared
to employees not exposed to sexual harassment, the
mean level of depressive symptoms was 2.05 (95% CI:
0.98–3.12) (p = 0.0002) points higher for employees
harassed by clients/customers. Employees harassed by
a
supervisor/colleague/subordinate
had
a
further
elevated
mean
level
of
2.45
(95%
CI:
0.57–4.34)
(p = 0.011) points. Applying a random slopes model
instead, yielded slightly different results, estimating
this mean difference to be 2.70 (95% CI: 0.45–4.95).
Effect modification by psychosocial workplace initiatives
Regarding the psychosocial workplace initiatives as po-
tential modifiers of associations, we found no statistically
significant interactions of harassment from clients/cus-
tomers with any of the examined psychosocial workplace
initiatives (all p > 0.05). There were also no statistically
significant main effects of the examined psychosocial
workplace initiatives on the level of depressive symp-
toms amongst employees (all p > 0.05, data available on
request).
Sensitivity analyses
In sensitivity analysis 1, we restricted our sample to care
workers and found a mean level of depressive symptoms
that was 2.05 (95% CI: 0.83–3.27) (p = 0.001) points
higher for employees exposed to sexual harassment from
clients or customers compared to non-exposed em-
ployees. In this analysis, however, there was no statisti-
cally significant difference in symptom level between
participants harassed by supervisors/colleagues/subordi-
nates compared to participants harassed by clients/cus-
tomers (mean difference − 1.03(−3.14; 1.08)).
By changing the outcome to clinical depression
(sensitivity analysis 2) we found no statistically in-
creased
risk
(OR
=
1.19
(95%
CI:
0.72–1.97)
(p = 0.50) of clinical depression among those harassed
by clients/customers compared to non-exposed. For
participants harassed by supervisors/colleagues/subor-
dinates
we
observed
a
statistically
significantly
increased risk with an odds ratio of 3.30(1.62–6.73),
p = 0.001.

 When conducting the analyses separately for men
and women, results were largely similar to those
from the main analysis. The mean difference in
depressive
symptoms
associated
with
harassment
from
clients/customers
compared
to
non-exposed
participants was 1.36 points (−2.56–5.28) for men
and
2.17
(1.00–3.34)
for
women.
The
mean
difference in depressive symptoms associated with
harassment from supervisors/colleagues/subordinates
compared
to
participants
harassed
by
clients/
customers was 4.64 points (0.06–9.21) for men and
1.35 (−1.05–3.75) for women.
We found no statistically significant interactions with
the examined psychosocial workplace initiatives in any
of the sensitivity analyses.
Discussion
We found that exposure to workplace sexual harassment
was associated with a higher level of depressive symp-
toms compared to employees not exposed to sexual

 harassment. We also saw a tendency towards a stronger
association between sexual harassment and depressive
symptoms, when the harassment was conducted by
supervisors, colleagues or subordinates compared to
clients or customers. This difference, however, was not
robust when limiting the sample to participants working
in carework. We found no modification of the association
between sexual harassment from clients or customers and
depressive symptoms by any of the examined psychosocial
workplace initiatives.
Sexual harassment from clients or customers and
depressive symptoms
Our finding of an association between workplace sexual
harassment from clients or customers and depressive
symptoms is in line with occupation specific studies in-
dicating a relationship between sexual harassment from
clients or customers and various negative outcomes such
as decreased work ability, headache, self-reported stress,
and alcohol use [13, 18, 19, 58–60]. However, two recent
Danish studies [40, 57] found no statistically significant
association with long-term sickness absence. It is pos-
sible that sexual harassment from clients may be more
related to “softer” indicators of well-being and less
severe mental health problems than to more severe indi-
cators such as long-term sickness absence or clinical
mental disorders. For employees to stay in person-
related professions, they may feel compelled to cope
with sexual harassment. Therefore, employees who are
able to remain in person-related professions may be less
sensitive to exposure to sexual harassment from clients
or customers, compared to other employees (healthy
worker selection).
Our findings nonetheless underline the importance of
identifying methods to prevent both the occurrence of
sexual harassment from clients or customers and the
development of depressive symptoms following sexual
harassment in person-related professions. This is the
case as sexual harassment from clients or customers was
associated with a higher mean level of depressive symp-
toms compared to no exposure, although this difference
was smaller than that for exposure from colleagues,
supervisors or subordinates. Not only are depressive
symptoms associated with reduced general well-being
limiting social interactions and work ability, employees ex-
periencing depressive symptoms can also be at substantial
risk of developing clinically significant mental health
conditions such as depression and anxiety [61–63].
Sexual harassment from colleagues, supervisors or
subordinates and depressive symptoms
We found a tendency that employees harassed by col-
leagues, supervisors or subordinates had a higher mean
level of depressive symptoms compared to employees
harassed by clients or customers. This result suggests
that it may be important to investigate sexual harassment
from clients or customers and sexual harassment by col-
leagues, supervisors or subordinates as two distinct types
of harassment. Several factors may be hypothesized to ex-
plain the difference in depressive symptoms associated
with these two different forms of harassment.
It may be more difficult for employees to react on and
report sexual harassment when conducted by a col-
league, supervisor or subordinate. Employees harassed
by a colleague, supervisor or subordinate may fear job
loss, retribution and that the harasser will not receive
any penalty [10]. This notion is in line with research
showing that only between 5 and 30% of targets to sex-
ual harassment in general file formal complaints, and
that employees harassed by a supervisor are less likely to
report the conduct [10, 64]. Contrary, in person-related
professions it is often recognized that sexual harassment
can occur and it may be perceived as a part of the job to
manage such situations [3, 5, 16, 65]. It is also possible
that harassment from colleagues, supervisors or subordi-
nates may have had a longer duration compared to har-
assment from clients. We could not include information
on duration in the present study, but it is certainly

 plausible that longer exposure to harassment has more
detrimental mental health effects compared to more
brief exposure, all else being equal. In addition, when sex-
ual harassment is conducted by a supervisor, a power-
perspective must be acknowledged. It is possible that the
effects of sexual harassment are more severe in the con-
text of power imbalance. Sexual harassment by supervi-
sors can also reflect sexual coercion, where the supervisor
offers bonuses, pay increases, and promotion in return for
sexual attention [10, 66, 67]. Further, sexual harassment
by a colleague, supervisor or subordinate can be indicative
of a poor work environment to a higher extent than sexual
harassment by clients or customers. Research suggest that
a poor organizational climate (e.g. a climate that tolerates
sexual harassment) is an antecedent to sexual harassment
and a direct contributor to mental health problems be-
yond the experience of sexual harassment [10, 67–71].
Also, studies report that perceptions of organizational
procedures for dealing with sexual harassment are related
to mental health problems [6, 69]. Finally, as stated above,
sexual harassment by clients or customers is often nor-
malized as an inevitable working condition [3, 5, 16, 65].
For employees to stay in person-related professions they
may feel they have to accept sexual harassment as a part
of professional practice. Therefore, a healthy worker selec-
tion may be involved, and the employees who are able to
remain in person-related professions may be less sensitive
to
exposure
to
sexual
harassment
from
clients
or
customers, compared to other employees. It should be
noted, that given the high correlation between job type
and exposure from clients or customers versus colleagues,
supervisors or subordinates, the results may reflect under-
lying differences in consequences of sexual harassment
within job types, rather than difference associated with the
source of harassment. This could not be separated in
detail in the present study. Further research looking into
the possible differential effects of sexual harassment
depending on the source of exposure, seems warranted.
Psychosocial workplace initiatives
We found no modification of the association between
sexual harassment from clients or customers and de-
pressive symptoms by any of the examined psycho-
social workplace initiatives. Temporal factors might
influence these results. The time frame for the inves-
tigated psychosocial workplace initiatives is up to
three years as the participating organizations were
asked about the implementation of workplace initia-
tives within the last three years. Consequently, for
some participants there can be a considerable time
lapse between the implementation of a workplace ini-
tiative and the development of depressive symptoms.
It is possible that only recent initiatives influence the
relation
between
sexual
harassment
by
clients
or
customers and depressive symptoms. Also, the investi-
gated psychosocial workplace initiatives were reported
by owners, organizational supervisors, employee rep-
resentatives
or
work
environment
representatives
making it a possibility that our result are affected by
information bias (supervisors over-reporting the im-
plementation of psychosocial workplace initiatives).
Further, the potentially modifying psychosocial work-
place initiatives examined in this study were relatively
broad and non-specific, as we were limited to data
collected in the WEADW. Thus our results do not
preclude that more specific workplace initiatives tar-
geted sexual harassment may be effective in prevent-
ing
the
occurrence
and
consequences
of
sexual
harassment by clients or customers (an issue that we
are investigating qualitatively as a separate element of
a research project of which the present study is part
[72]). Workplace initiatives targeted sexual harassment
could for instance establish common guidelines and
policies and thus provide employees with criteria for
acceptable and non-acceptable behavior. In line with
this notion, organizational procedures and climate is
found to be the strongest predictor of sexual harass-
ment [11]. Another initiative that can possibly prevent
negative consequences following sexual harassment by
clients or customers is to make social support from
colleagues and supervisors, in cases of sexual harass-
ment, a common and accepted practice [7, 11, 67].
Additionally, as sexual harassment from clients and
customers can be a working condition [3, 22], educat-
ing employees in avoiding and handling risk situations
might be relevant. One study indicates that confidence
in responding to sexual harassment can be considered
as a resource that prevents development of negative
mental health consequences [13].
Strengths and limitations
This is the first study to demonstrate an association
between sexual harassment by clients or customers and
depressive symptoms in a large cross-occupational sample
of employees. Additionally, this study is the first to compare
the mental health consequences of sexual harassment de-
pending on the source of exposure. Given the demographic
characteristics of this sample (7603 participants from 1041
organizations) the generalizability across the Danish work-
force is high. Further, the strengths of this study is the
measurement of several important psychosocial workplace
initiatives using WEADW, the application of a well-
validated rating scale to measure depressive symptoms, and
the usage of multilevel data including answers from both
employees and organizational supervisors (representatives
for the involved organizations). By applying multilevel mod-
elling, the dependence of employees within an organization
is considered [46–48].
Friborg et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:675 
Page 9 of 12
 Some limitations of the study must be noted. First, the
cross-sectional design means that temporality cannot be
established and consequently we cannot preclude reverse
causality. There is a possibility that depressive symptoms
can increase the risk of experiencing sexual harassment
at work – potentially because subjects with depressive
symptoms tend to perceive the environment more nega-
tively than individuals without depressive symptoms [73,
74]. Consequently, the possibility of reverse causality has
to be taken into account when interpreting the results.
Second, we used self-reported data, and such data are
vulnerable to subjective factors and outcome expecta-
tions [75]. Also we relied on participant’s ability to recall
episodes
of
sexual
harassment
during
a
12-month
period. Asking participants about sexual harassment ex-
perienced within a shorter period may have minimized
recall bias [76] but might have underestimated the
prevalence of sexual harassment. Third, the exposure to
sexual harassment was measured using a single item
measurement and there is a possibility that participants
may under- or over-report the occurrence of sexual har-
assment. Studies show that healthcare workers tend to
under-report violent incidents at work because they inter-
pret such incidents as a part of their job [5, 13, 77].Single
item measurements, on the other hand, have been argued
to result in over-reporting compared to using specific
questionnaires asking about a range of sexually harassing
behaviours [78]. In any case, it is important to keep in
mind, that the exposure in the present study was behav-
iors that were perceived and labelled by the respondents
as sexual harassment, irrespective of the specific nature of
this behavior. Fourth, although we adjusted for several
confounders, we lacked information on other confounders
that may be associated with depressive symptoms
such as history of psychological illness or traumatic
life events [59–61, 76]. Fifth, there was substantial
non-response amongst both invited participants and
workplaces.
There
is
a
possibility
that
this
non-
response might be selective, This may reduce the
generalizability of our findings, in particular to groups
less
likely
to
respond,
such
as
young
men
with
shorter education
[79,
80],
or
workplaces
with
a
poorer psychosocial work climate. Sixth, although we
analyzed data from a large cross-occupational sample of
Danish employees, the number of exposed individuals was
relatively low, increasing the statistical uncertainty of the
reported estimates. In particular, the sample included a
low number of men exposed to sexual harassment. Whilst
this likely reflects a lower prevalence of sexual harassment
amongst men than amongst women, it should be noted
that the reported main associations are largely driven by
the association in women. Though we found no strong in-
dications of different associations in men when separating
men and women in a sensitivity analysis, there was a large
statistical uncertainty of the estimate for men due to the
low number of exposed men included.
Conclusions
This study found that workplace sexual harassment from
clients or customers were associated with employee de-
pressive symptoms. The results underline the importance
of identifying methods to prevent sexual harassment from
clients or customers and to prevent the development of
depressive symptoms following this type of harassment.
We found no modification of the association by any of the
examined
psychosocial
workplace
initiatives.
Further
research is needed to identify psychosocial workplace
initiatives that may prevent depressive symptoms in
employees exposed to workplace sexual harassment by
clients or customers. Whether specific workplace initia-
tives targeting sexual harassment are more effective than
general psychosocial organizational changes needs to be
examined. Additionally, the results suggested that the
association between sexual harassment and depressive
symptoms differed for employees harassed by clients or
customers compared to those harassed by colleagues,
supervisors or subordinates. This result underlines the
need to investigate sexual harassment from clients or cus-
tomers and sexual harassment by colleagues, supervisors
or subordinates as two distinct types of harassment.
