In Brief
Bomba-Warczak et al. demonstrate that
BoNT/A, BoNT/D, and TeNT enter
neurons via two separate entry pathways,
a canonical synaptic vesicle recycling
pathway that leads to local effects and a
distinct secondary uptake pathway that
directs these toxins to a common, non-
acidified, retrograde carrier. This
secondary pathway leads to distal effects
in neurons upstream from the cells that
mediate the initial uptake of these agents.

SUMMARY
Recent reports suggest that botulinum neurotoxin
(BoNT) A, which is widely used clinically to inhibit
neurotransmission, can spread within networks of
neurons to have distal effects, but this remains
controversial. Moreover, it is not known whether
other members of this toxin family are transferred
between neurons. Here, we investigate the poten-
tial distal effects of BoNT/A, BoNT/D, and tetanus
toxin (TeNT), using central neurons grown in mi-
crofluidic devices. Toxins acted upon the neurons
that mediated initial entry, but all three toxins were
also taken up, via an alternative pathway, into non-
acidified organelles that mediated retrograde trans-
port to the somato-dendritic compartment. Toxins
were then released into the media, where they
entered and exerted their effects upon upstream
neurons. These findings directly demonstrate that
these agents undergo transcytosis and interneuronal
transfer in an active form, resulting in long-distance
effects.
INTRODUCTION
The clostridial neurotoxins (CNTs), comprising tetanus toxin
(TeNT) and seven serologically distinct botulinum neurotoxins
(BoNT/A–BoNT/G), are among the deadliest agents known,
with BoNT/A having an estimated median lethal dose (LD50) of
1 ng/kg body weight (Gill, 1982). Due to the potential use of
BoNTs as biological weapons, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) designated the BoNTs as tier 1 select
agents. Paradoxically, BoNT/A (onabotulinumtoxin A, abobotuli-
numtoxin A, incobotulinumtoxin A) and BoNT/B (rimabotulinum-
toxinB), are also used clinically. In addition to the well-known
cosmetic uses of BoNT/A, both serotypes are also used to
treat numerous medical conditions, including cervical dystonia,
strabismus, migraine headaches, overactive bladder (neuro-
genic and idiopathic), hyperhidrosis, upper limb spasticity, and
blepharospasm (de Maio, 2008). They are also used ‘‘off label’’
to treat a variety of additional conditions that include chronic lower
back pain, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, achalasia, voice
abnormalities, and various additional dystonias (Scott, 1980;
Schantz and Johnson, 1992; Silberstein et al., 2000; Foster
et al., 2001; Jankovic, 1994). According to Allergan’s 2013 Annual
Report (http://www.allergan.com/miscellaneous-pages/allergan-
pdf-files/2013annualreport), more than half of all patients who
receive toxin injections do so for medical, rather than aesthetic,
reasons. Given their extreme potency, widespread medical use,
and potential use as bioterrorism agents, the CNTs are the subject
of intensive investigation.
The CNTs are produced by anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria
of the genus Clostridium (Popoff and Bouvet, 2013). Each CNT is
composed of a heavy chain (HC) and a light chain (LC) linked via
a disulfide bond. The first step in the action of these agents
involves high-affinity interactions with neurons, mediated by
their HCs. Binding occurs via a dual-receptor mechanism,
where the receptors are composed of polysialic gangliosides
in conjunction with proteins. For most of these toxins, protein
receptors are presented by recycling synaptic vesicles (SVs).
Upon exocytosis, the luminal domains of SV proteins are
exposed to the extracellular milieu; BoNT/B, BoNT/G, and a
naturally occurring D-C chimera bind to the intraluminal tail of
the SV proteins synaptotagmin 1 and 2 (Nishiki et al., 1994;
Dong et al., 2003; Rummel et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2012), while
BoNTs A, D, and E and TeNT bind to synaptic vesicle protein 2
(SV2) (Dong et al., 2006, 2008; Yeh et al., 2010; Mahrhold
et al., 2006, 2013; Peng et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2009; Rummel
et al., 2009; Benoit et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2016). BoNT/F was
also found to bind to SV2; however, it is not clear whether SV2
serves as a functional protein receptor for this toxin, as primary
hippocampal neurons lacking SV2 show no changes in sensi-
tivity to BoNT/F (Fu et al., 2009; Rummel et al., 2009; Peng
et al., 2012; Yeh et al., 2010). The identity of the protein receptor
for BoNT/C remains to be established. Upon SV endocytosis, the
drop in luminal pH triggers the transformation of the HC into a
translocation machine (Fischer, 2013; Montal, 2010; Williamson
and Neale, 1994; Fu et al., 2002; Puhar et al., 2004; Galloux
et al., 2008; Pirazzini et al., 2013); interestingly, the ability to
sense low pH requires the interaction of the HC with the gangli-
oside co-receptor (Sun et al., 2011). The HC then translocates
the LC into the cytosol, where it cleaves neuronal soluble

 N-ethylmaleimide attachment receptors (SNAREs), which form
the core of a conserved membrane fusion complex (Rothman,
1994). Cleavage, thereby, inhibits neurotransmission. BoNT/C
cleaves the target membrane SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25;
BoNT/A and BoNT/E cleave SNAP-25; and BoNTs D, B, F, and
G and TeNT cleave the vesicular SNARE, synaptobrevin/VAMP
(Rossetto et al., 2014; Schiavo et al., 2000; Jahn and Niemann,
1994; Montecucco and Schiavo, 1995). Recently, two additional
putative toxin receptors have been identified: fibroblast growth
factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) for BoNT/A and nidogens 1 and 2 for
TeNT (Bercsenyi et al., 2014; Jacky et al., 2013). How these pro-
teins act in conjunction with the primary protein receptor, SV2,
remains unknown.
It is widely believed that BoNT/A confers its medicinal effects
by inhibiting synaptic transmission near the site of injection; i.e.,
that this toxin has only local effects at the neuromuscular junc-
tion (NMJ), resulting in flaccid paralysis. However, this idea
has been called into question by physicians utilizing this agent
in human patients. For example, after peripheral injection of
BoNT/A, reciprocal inhibition between agonist and antagonist
muscles has been reported, raising the possibility that BoNT/A
moves within networks of neurons to affect circuit function (Priori
et al., 1995; Aymard et al., 2013; Marchand-Pauvert et al., 2013;
Ceballos-Baumann et al., 1997; Giladi, 1997). Alternatively, the
observed effects might be due to the compensatory reorganiza-
tion and remodeling of neuronal networks upstream of the injec-
tion site, as a result of purely local effects on the initial uptake
neurons (Berardelli and Curra, 2002; Curra
` et al., 2004; Gilio
et al., 2000; Boroojerdi et al., 2003; Abbruzzese and Berardelli,
2006). A major goal in the field is to determine which of these
models is correct.
What is known concerning the movement of the BoNTs?
BoNT/A and BoNT/E were recently shown to undergo retrograde
axonal transport in cultured motor neurons, but putative transfer
and action on upstream neurons was not addressed in these
in vitro experiments (Restani et al., 2012a). For clarity, we note
that these authors used the term ‘‘distal’’ or ‘‘central’’ effects,
but this refers to the action of the toxins in the somatodendritic
compartment (which can lie in the CNS in vivo) versus their action
within pre-synaptic boutons, where they were initially taken up.
However, it is well established that the toxin LC can diffuse
and cleave SNAREs throughout neurons, so we use the term
‘‘distal effects’’ to indicate the action of the toxins on neurons
that are upstream from the neurons that mediate the initial up-
take step. Interestingly, in whole-animal experiments, BoNT/A
was reported to have bona fide distal effects (i.e., effects on up-
stream neurons) (Antonucci et al., 2008; Restani et al., 2011)), but
this could not be reproduced in an in vitro system based on
cultured neurons (Lawrence et al., 2012). Furthermore, the inter-
pretation of data obtained from in vivo approaches can be
confounded by myriad variables, including long axon collaterals
that can make it appear as if distal effects are occurring. Collec-
tively, the question of whether BoNT/A confers its medicinal
effects indirectly (network remodeling) or directly (by interneu-
ronal transfer and action of holotoxin) remains to be definitively
addressed. The in vitro system described in the present study
circumvents the caveats mentioned earlier and allowed us to
resolve the controversy surrounding distal effects of CNTs.
The goal of the present study was to directly ascertain whether
CNTs move from neuron to neuron, in an active form, resulting in
the cleavage of SNAREs in cells that are upstream from the initial
uptake neurons. As earlier work focused on in vivo experiments
(Antonucci et al., 2008; Restani et al., 2011, 2012a, 2012b), here,
we sought an in vitro experimental approach that can be used
to directly visualize toxin action within networks of neurons and
that provides an experimentally amenable system to elucidate
the mechanisms that mediate local versus distal effects. In our
study, we utilized cultured hippocampal neurons, grown in mi-
crofluidic devices, to directly compare our results with those of
Antonucci et al. (2008), who injected BoNT/A directly into the hip-
pocampus of intact mice. The experiments reported here clearly
establish that BoNT/A, BoNT/D, and TeNT undergo retrograde
transport along axons, followed by cell-to-cell transfer of the
intact holotoxins into upstream neurons where they cleave
SNAREs. Additionally, we characterize the receptors and entry
pathways that mediate interneuronal transfer of these agents.
Together, these experiments demonstrate that CNTs interact
with host cells in a more complex manner than was originally en-
visioned, prompting further re-evaluation of the clinical uses of
BoNT/A.
RESULTS
Visualization of Interneuronal Transfer and Action of
the CNTs
In order to address the question of whether the CNTs move
within networks of neurons, we utilized compartmentalized
microfluidic devices. Three toxin serotypes were examined:
BoNT/A, which cleaves SNAP-25A and -B (hereinafter SNAP-
25); and BoNT/D and TeNT, which cleave a number of synapto-
brevin (syb) isoforms, with syb2 being the major isoform that
mediates rapid exocytosis at many synapses (Montecucco and
Schiavo, 1995; Turton et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2005). The exper-
imental layout is shown in Figure 1A. Rat hippocampal neurons
are seeded in one macrochannel (i.e., the soma chamber). By
14 days in vitro, axons project through the microchannels to
the opposing macrochamber (i.e., the axon chamber). Dendrites
are unable to traverse the microchannel (Figure 1B); hence, only
axons are present in the axon chamber (Taylor et al., 2005). The
axon chamber was then loaded with a dye, Calcein-AM-green
(Figure 1A), to label all of the axons and their corresponding
cell bodies and processes residing within the soma chamber.
Counterstaining of the soma side with Calcein-AM-red (Fig-
ure 1A), which labeled both projecting (to the axonal side) and
non-projecting cells, revealed that only 24% ± 1.5% of cells
seeded in the soma side extend their axons to the axon chamber
(green cells) and that over half of these ‘‘projecting neurons’’
(52% ± 2.9%) reside in the proximal region of the chamber, close
to the mouth of the microchannels. With rare exceptions (3% ±
0.6%), neurons distal from the microgroove barrier do not extend
axons to the axon chamber, creating a hierarchy of neuronal
connectivity. Representative images of distal and proximal re-
gions in the soma side, along with a proximal region in the
axon side, are shown in Figure 1A (right panels). Microfluidic
isolation is achieved and maintained by keeping the media vol-
ume in the soma chamber higher (300 ml), as compared to that
Cell Reports 16, 1974–1987, August 16, 2016
1975
 in the axon chamber (200 ml). This volume difference prevents
diffusion of molecules from the axon side to the soma side, as re-
ported previously (Taylor et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2015; David
et al., 2012); fluidic isolation is validated using fluorescent
markers in Figure S1. Moreover, we routinely include fluorescent
dyes in the microfluidics to ensure that fluidic isolation is main-
tained and leak does not occur; when leak occurs, these sam-
ples are excluded from further analysis (Figure S1; <5% of the
devices fail to seal).
When the soma chamber was incubated with BoNT/A,
BoNT/D, or TeNT, nearly complete cleavage of SNAP-25 or
syb2, respectively, was observed at 48 hr (Figures 1C–1E).
Cleavage of SNAP-25 by BoNT/A was monitored by measuring
the ratio of full-length to cleaved protein (c-SNAP-25); actin
served as a loading control. Cleavage of syb2 by TeNT and
BoNT/D was monitored by measuring the loss of substrate
signal, and these values were normalized to the actin signals in
each sample. Interestingly, when toxins were added to the
axon side, the degree of cleavage observed in the soma side
far exceeded the levels predicted by the fraction of neurons
that project axons from the soma to the axon side (24% ±
1.5%, as indicated by the dashed line in the bar graphs in Figures

Figure 1. CNTs Cleave Substrates beyond the Levels Predicted by Connectivity of Neurons in Compartmentalized Microfluidic Devices
(A) Dissociated hippocampal neurons were seeded into the soma chamber (top, red) of a microfluidic device. The number of cells that extend axons through the
microchannels to the axon chamber (projecting cells) was determined by differential Calcein-AM-red and -green staining, added to the soma (top) and axon
(bottom) chambers, respectively. Projecting cells are green/yellow; non-projecting cells are red. The number of projecting neurons drops sharply from 52% ±
2.9% of cells residing proximal to the microchannels in the soma side to 31% ± 3.5% in the mid-proximal region, 14% ± 2.5% in the mid-distal region, and to just
3% ± 0.6% in the most distal region. Representative image of Calcein-stained neurons; white boxes denote regions that are magnified in the right panel.
(B) Dendrites fail to reach the axon side due to the length of the microgroove barrier, creating an isolated axonal compartment, as illustrated by staining with MAP2
to mark dendrites (red/orange) and tau1 to mark axons (blue).
(C) BoNT/A was added to the soma (10 nM) or axon (30 nM) side of the microfluidic device. After 48 hr, cells in the soma chamber were assayed for substrate
cleavage via immunoblot analysis. The horizontal dotted line represents the total fraction of cells projecting to the axon side (24% ± 1.5%). Cleavage of substrate
was abolished by axotomy.
(D and E) Similarly, TeNT (D) or BoNT/D (E) was added to either the soma or axon side of microfluidic devices, and cleavage of syb2 was assayed by immunoblot
analysis.

 1C–1E). Namely, 48 hr after addition to the axon side, BoNT/A
cleaved 49.6% of SNAP-25, while TeNT and BoNT/D cleaved
63.7% and 83.8% of syb2, respectively, on the soma side. Sig-
nificant substrate protection was observed following axotomy in
the axon chamber, demonstrating that axonal transport was
required for efficient substrate cleavage in the soma chamber;
these observations further rule out diffusion of toxin from one
side of the device to the other. While we routinely used 10–
30 nM toxin in the axon side, distal effects were also observed
using lower, clinically relevant concentrations (picomolar) of
BoNT/A and TeNT, though this required an extended incubation
period (Figure S2); hence, the remainder of the experiments were
carried out using higher toxin concentrations so that we could
assay for toxin effects on short timescales (24–48 hr).
Next, we conducted experiments to determine more directly
whether the observed substrate cleavage within the soma cham-
ber occurs in second-order neurons that do not project axons
to the axon side. Due to the dramatic difference in connectivity
of neurons between proximal and distal regions of the soma
side, we monitored substrate cleavage in those two regions via
immunocytochemistry. For all of these experiments, Calcein-
AM-green was added to the axon side to mark projecting
neurons; representative images of this staining along with the
corresponding immunocytochemistry are shown (Figure 2A).
Each microfluidic was stained for MAP2 to mark all neurons
and VGlut1 to mark synapses (similar results were obtained
using vGAT to mark inhibitory synapses; data not shown). Cleav-
age of SNAP-25 by BoNT/A was measured using an antibody
that is specific for the cleaved form of this protein (c-SNAP-
25). Only background signals for c-SNAP-25 were observed,
proximally and distally, in control microfluidics, and the greatest
degree of cleavage was observed in both regions when the soma
chamber was directly treated with BoNT/A; these data are quan-
tified in Figure 2B. We then treated the axon chamber with BoNT/
A and observed significant cleavage in the proximal region of the
soma side, as expected, since over 50% of cells in this region
project to the axon side. Importantly, we also observed efficient
cleavage distally, in neurons that did not project axons to the
axon side, as evidenced by the absence of Calcein-AM staining.
As a control, we again performed axotomy, which diminished the
cleavage of SNAP-25.
To determine the generality of the findings obtained using
BoNT/A, we tested both TeNT and BoNT/D using a similar
experimental design. Representative images of Calcein-AM-
green, along with VGlut and syb2 staining for each experiment,
are shown (Figures 3A and 3C). In control microfluidics, syb2
and VGlut1 are co-localized, as expected. Soma treatment
with TeNT and BoNT/D resulted in near-complete cleavage of
syb2 in both the proximal and distal regions, as illustrated by
the lack of staining following the application of either toxin,
which was quantified in Figures 3B and 3D. Axon-side treat-
ments with either toxin led to efficient cleavage in the soma
side, both proximal to, and distal from, the microchannels;
cleavage was inhibited by axotomy. Notably, BoNT/D had
particularly strong distal effects; we observed almost complete
cleavage of its substrate throughout the microfluidic device,
including the reservoirs, which are millimeters away (data not
shown).
Holotoxins, Released into the Media from the Initial
Uptake Neuron, Enter Upstream Neurons
The aforementioned experiments provide strong support for the
idea that a fraction of BoNT/A, BoNT/D, and TeNT can, in fact,
undergo retrograde transport and inter-neuronal transfer. In the
next series of experiments, we further explored this idea by
determining whether substrate cleavage in the soma chamber
could be blocked by adding an excess toxin receptor binding
(HC) domain, to interfere with toxin-receptor recognition, or by
adding anti-toxin antibodies that, in principle, should intercept
toxin molecules as they leave the initial uptake neuron, thus
preventing their action upon other neurons. Neutralizing anti-
BoNT/A and anti-BoNT/D antibodies were tested previously
(Bjo
¨ rnstad et al., 2014; Kalb et al., 2009); anti-TeNT antibody
was validated by neutralization of TeNT in primary hippocampal
neurons (data not shown). The scheme for these experiments is
shown in Figure 4A.
Holotoxins were added to the axon side, while the soma side
was pre-incubated with corresponding HC fragments, or anti-
toxin antibodies. Substrate cleavage in both proximal and distal
regions in the soma macrochannel was monitored via immuno-
cytochemistry, as described in Figure 2. For all three toxins, HC
fragments and anti-toxin antibodies provided significant protec-
tion from cleavage within the soma side (Figures 4B–4D). In each
case, there was a trend toward greater protection in the distal
regions, as compared to the proximal regions, but since 48%
of neurons in the proximal region do not project axons to the
axon side of the device (see Figure 1A), some degree of protec-
tion, even in the proximal region, was expected if the toxins un-
derwent interneuronal transfer. Together, these results indicate
that, after uptake on the axon side, the toxins are retrogradely
transported to the soma side, where they are released into the
media; the toxins then enter upstream neurons.
An Alternative SV-Independent Pathway Underlies the
Distal Effects of the CNTs
Following entry into neurons via recycling SVs, acidification of
the vesicle lumen triggers the translocation of the LC into the
cytosol. In order for the toxin to traffic to the soma side, and to
be released in an active form to enter and affect upstream neu-
rons, the LC must remain linked to the HC. This can be achieved
if the toxin is located in a non-SV compartment that does not un-
dergo significant luminal acidification (or acidifies slowly enough
to first allow transport without translocation). Previous work re-
ported that TeNT, as well as BoNT/A and BoNT/E, indeed share
a common retrograde transport organelle that does not acidify
(Restani et al., 2012a). However, in contrast to BoNT/A, BoNT/E
was shown not to exert distal effects (Restani et al., 2012b;
Antonucci et al., 2008), and trafficking of BoNT/D has not been
studied.
To directly monitor toxin co-trafficking, HC fragments derived
from each of the three serotypes studied here were labeled
with either Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 and added to the axon cham-
ber for 4–24 hr prior to imaging. Entry and trafficking of the
labeled HC fragments were monitored, within the microchannels,
�350–400 mm away from the axon side (Figure 5A, red box). As
before, microfluidic isolation was maintained with a higher vol-
ume of media on the soma side throughout the entire length of
Cell Reports 16, 1974–1987, August 16, 2016
1977
 the experiment to prevent diffusion of the HC domains to the
soma side (see Figure S1). We observed that labeled HC domains
derived from both BoNT/D and BoNT/A (D-HC and A-HC, respec-
tively) co-localized to the same transport organelles (77%; Fig-
ure 5E), which were observed moving retrogradely (Figure 5B).
HC fragments from BoNT/D and TeNT were also co-localized in
retrograde transport organelles (80%; Figures 5C and 5E), which
do not acidify, as evidenced by a lack of co-localization of D-HC
with LysoTracker (16%; Figures 5D and 5E; Movie S1). These
observations fit the idea that a common carrier mediates the
retrograde trafficking of these agents. The lack of acidification
allows the holotoxins to remain intact so that when they are
released they are able to bind, enter, and affect upstream
neurons.
TeNT, BoNT/A, and BoNT/D utilize SV2 as a protein receptor
to enter cells via the SV recycling pathway (Dong et al., 2006;
Yeh et al., 2010; Mahrhold et al., 2006; Peng et al., 2011). In
the absence of this receptor, cleavage of substrate by all three

side of the microfluidics are shown (regions of interest indicated by red boxes). Neurons growing in both proximal and distal regions stain positive for the dendritic

with BoNT/A on the soma side (10 nM) or axon side (30 nM) with and without axotomy for 24 hr. Cleavage of SNAP-25 was assayed using an antibody that
recognizes the BoNT/A cleaved form of this protein (c-SNAP-25). Only background signals for c-SNAP-25 were observed, both proximally and distally, in control
microfluidics; robust cleavage was observed following soma treatment with BoNT/A, in both regions. After addition of BoNT/A to the axon side, c-SNAP-25 was
observed in proximal as well as distal regions of the soma side, and cleavage was significantly reduced by axotomy.

 toxins is significantly reduced, and knockout (KO) animals lack-
ing SV2A/B are resistant to the toxins. Of the three isoforms of
SV2, the majority of hippocampal neurons exclusively express
SV2A and SV2B (Dong et al., 2006; Janz and S€
udhof, 1999; Baj-
jalieh et al., 1994; Peng et al., 2011), and only a small population
of hippocampal neurons express SV2C (Peng et al., 2011; Dong
et al., 2008). Therefore, neurons obtained from SV2A/B double-
KO (DKO) animals serve as a desirable model to investigate
whether the secondary, ‘‘non-productive’’ pathway (i.e., fails to
trigger translocation) occurs via an SV2-independent mecha-
nism. To address this, hippocampal neurons from embryonic
day (E)15.5 (wild-type) WT and SV2A/B DKO mice were seeded
into microfluidic devices. Toxin HC fragments, conjugated to

Figure 3. Cleavage of Substrate by BoNT/D
and TeNT in Upstream Neurons
(A and B) As in Figure 2, (A) images of Calcein-
AM-green-stained neurons were inverted and
switched to grayscale. Neurons in both proximal
and distal regions of the soma side stain positive
for the synaptic vesicle marker, vGlut1 (green), and
syb2 (red); MAP2 staining is not shown. Micro-
fluidics were treated with either (A) TeNT or (B)
BoNT/D for 24 hr (10 nM toxin for soma side
treatments, 30 nM for axon side treatments), fixed,
and assayed for syb2 cleavage via immunocyto-
chemistry. In both cases, cleavage of substrate
was observed in proximal as well as distal, non-
projecting neurons, and syb2 was protected from
cleavage by axotomy.

quantum dots (Qdots) (Figure S3), were
added to the axon side of cultures 13–
14 DIV (days in vitro). After 6 hr, entry
and trafficking of HC Qdots was moni-
tored, as described earlier for the organic
dyes. Qdot-labeled HC domains derived
from all three toxins entered WT axons
and
underwent
retrograde
transport
toward the soma side (Figures 5F–5K).
The speed of toxin HC transport is in
agreement with data from earlier studies
of TeNT and BoNT/A (Restani et al.,
2012a) and is consistent with the speed
reported for fast axon retrograde trans-
port of endosomal carriers (Deinhardt
et al., 2006, 2007; Salinas et al., 2009).
Importantly, all three HC fragments effi-
ciently entered SV2A/B DKO neurons,
where they also underwent processive,
retrograde transport with speeds that
were comparable to those found using
WT neurons (Figures 5F–5K, right panel;
Movie S2). The entry and overlap in speed
distribution profiles of these toxin fragments indicate that (1) all
three toxins share a retrograde trafficking route and that (2) sort-
ing of the toxin into this organelle is independent of interactions
with SV2, clearly establishing the existence of second receptor
and uptake pathway for each toxin.
Assessing Candidate Receptors for the Second CNT
Uptake Pathway
Together, the results thus far reveal two distinct uptake/traf-
ficking pathways for BoNT/A, BoNT/D, and TeNT: the canonical
SV pathway, which leads to acidification and local effects, and a
second, SV receptor independent pathway that routes the toxins
to a common non-acidified carrier that mediates delivery to distal

 sites. As detailed earlier, receptors for the SV pathway have been
established for most of the CNTs: SV2 serves as the SV receptor
for all three toxins examined here. However, it has also been re-
ported that FGFR3 and nidogens 1 and 2 might serve as recep-
tors for BoNT/A and TeNT, respectively (Bercsenyi et al., 2014;
Jacky et al., 2013). Namely, the 2,3 loop of FGFR3b (FGFR3L2,3)
was shown to interfere with toxin and host cell interactions
(Jacky et al., 2013), and peptides derived from nidogens 1 and
2 (N1 and N2, respectively) were shown to protect mice from
the effects of TeNT (Bercsenyi et al., 2014). We tested these
reagents in microfluidic devices by pre-incubating them with
holotoxins and then adding them to the axon side, followed by
immunocytochemistry to determine whether they prevented
toxin action in proximal and distal regions in the soma chamber.
The scheme for these experiments is shown in Figure 6A.
As a control, and as expected, the A-HC fragment protected
neurons in the soma macrochannel when added together with
BoNT/A on the axon side (Figure 6B). Surprisingly, inclusion of
the FGFR3L2,3, which was implicated in the action of BoNT/A
(Jacky et al., 2013), but not any other serotype, resulted in
enhanced cleavage of SNAP-25 in the proximal region of the
soma macrochannel and had no significant effect on cleavage
in the distal region. Equally surprising was the finding that the
nidogen peptide N2 resulted in significant protection of distal
neurons from the action of BoNT/A. This was unexpected, as
A-HC was found to bind nidogen 2 KO neurons just as efficiently
as WT cells, and nidogens have been implicated only in the ac-
tion of TeNT (Bercsenyi et al., 2014). The N1 peptide was without
effect.

Figure 4. BoNT/A, BoNT/D, and TeNT Are
Released by the Primary Uptake Neurons
to Enter Upstream Neurons
(A–D) In (A), a schematic representation is shown
of the experimental design. Soma chambers were
pre-treated with either A-HC, D-HC, or T-HC do-
mains (300 nM for A-HC and T-HC, 100 nM for
D-HC) or anti-CNT antibodies specific for each
toxin, followed by addition of holotoxin to the axon
side of the microfluidic (30 nM of BoNT/A and
TeNT, 10 nM of BoNT/D). After 24 hr, neurons were
fixed and stained for VGlut1, MAP2, and c-SNAP-
25 for BoNT/A (B), or syb2 for TeNT (C) and
BoNT/D (D). Images were obtained from proximal
and distal regions of soma side and analyzed as in
Figures 2 and 3. In each case, inclusion of HC
fragments, or antibodies, in the soma chamber,
protected neurons from substrate cleavage, both
proximally and distally, for BoNT/A (B), TeNT (C),
and BoNT/D (D), demonstrating that toxins physi-
cally leave uptake neurons and enter upstream
neurons where they cleave SNAREs.
All plotted values are averages ± SEM; minimum of
three to four images from each region (proximal/
distal), from four to five separate experiments.
**p % 0.01; ****p % 0.0001; ns indicates p > 0.05.
Similar experiments were carried out for
TeNT. As expected, partial proximal and
strong distal protection was observed on
the soma side when the axon side was co-treated with TeNT
and T-HC (labeled HC domain derived from TeNT) (Figure 6C).
FGFR3L2,3 was without effect, but both nidogen peptides, N1
and N2, reduced syb2 cleavage on the soma side in three out of
four conditions; the only exception was N1, which failed to protect
proximally. Together, these data suggest that nidogens might
play a role in TeNT entry into, or trafficking within, the second
uptake pathway.
Finally, we carried out the same experiments using BoNT/D,
which has the most pronounced distal effects studied so far.
While the D-HC fragment from this serotype resulted in protec-
tion from syb2 cleavage in both the proximal and distal regions
of the soma channel, none of the putative alternative receptor
fragments had any demonstrable effect on the action of this
toxin (Figure 6D). We note that none of the alternative receptor
fragments affected the interaction of native SV2, from brain
detergent extracts, with immobilized HC fragments derived
from all three toxins, indicating that these agents do not interfere
with the SV uptake pathway (Figures S4A–S4C). In addition, pre-
incubation of toxins with alternative receptor fragments had
no effect on toxin-mediated substrate cleavage when applied
directly to neurons grown in mass culture (Figures S4D–S4F).
DISCUSSION
Owing to the opposing clinical presentations of tetanus and
botulism, which are associated with rigid and flaccid paralysis,
respectively, it has been long assumed that TeNT and BoNTs,
once they enter the nervous system at the NMJ, have distinct

 itineraries. After TeNT is internalized, it is sorted into signaling en-
dosomes that undergo retrograde transport into the spinal cord
(Salinas et al., 2010). The holotoxin is then thought to undergo
interneuronal transfer to upstream inhibitory neurons to cleave
syb2 and block neurotransmission (Deinhardt et al., 2006; von
Bartheld, 2004). This disinhibition results in the rigid paralysis
characteristic of this agent (Montecucco and Schiavo, 1995; Tur-
ton et al., 2002). Since intoxication with BoNTs leads to flaccid
paralysis, it was inferred that these toxins remain confined to
the NMJ, where they cleave their target SNAREs within presyn-
aptic boutons of motor neurons. However, as discussed in the
Introduction, recent studies raised the issue that BoNT/A might
also undergo transcytosis and cell-to-cell transfer, but this re-
mains controversial. Moreover, there is no evidence that any
other BoNTs can move from neuron to neuron to exert distal ef-
fects, and numerous questions remain concerning the move-
ment of TeNT from neuron to neuron.
In the present study, we used microfluidic devices to directly
address the question of whether BoNT/A and TeNT, as well as
the less studied serotype, BoNT/D, can spread within networks

 of neurons to have distal effects (as shown in the model in Fig-
ure 7). The microfluidic system used in these experiments pro-
vides a straightforward means to analyze toxin action within a
hierarchy of neurons, which reflects the connectivity of neuronal
networks that exist in vivo. We note that the interpretation of
in vivo experiments depends on the absolute knowledge that
there are no direct connections between the region injected
with toxin and the distal region that is analyzed. This is circum-
vented in the microfluidics approach by the use of Calcein-AM
to precisely map the connectivity of the entire network. Use of
this dye made it possible to directly visualize distal effects of
the CNTs, as substrate cleavage was observed in neurons that
were not directly treated with toxins (Figures 2 and 3). The micro-
fluidics also made it feasible to readily visualize toxin trafficking
and to carry out perturbation experiments that cannot be per-
formed in whole-animal studies. For example, it was possible
to exploit SV2 KO neurons (as these mice are not viable as
adults) to directly reveal the existence of an alternative, SV2-in-
dependent uptake pathway of the three toxins examined here.
The retrograde trafficking of TeNT-containing signaling endo-
somes has been described in detail (Lalli and Schiavo, 2002; Ca-
leo et al., 2009; Deinhardt et al., 2006), but the mechanisms that
mediate the sorting and putative transcytosis from the initial up-
take neuron to an upstream neuron remain somewhat obscure
(Erdmann et al., 1981; Sverdlov and Alekseeva, 1966; Curtis
and De Groat, 1968). One of the most convincing observations
concerning distal effects of TeNT was the finding, more than
3 decades ago, that the intraspinal injection of TeNT antitoxin,
post-peripheral injection of TeNT, prevents hindlimb rigidity in
rats (Erdmann et al., 1981). In the present study, we recapitu-
lated these classical findings by showing that inclusion of an
Figure 7. Model Depicting Two Distinct Traf-
ficking Pathways for BoNT/A, BoNT/D, and
TeNT
Toxins can enter the SV2-dependent pathway,
which leads to local effects and results in substrate
cleavage throughout the cell (shown in green:
pathway indicated by dashed lines, left side), or they
can enter via an alternative receptor pathway (solid
lines, right side), which leads to distal effects [1].
Since the CNTs tested here do not all enter via the
same secondary receptor, additional local sorting
steps are required before the CNTs can converge
into
the
common,
non-acidified,
retrogradely
transported organelle [2]. The holotoxin is then
delivered to the somato-dendritic compartment,
where it undergoes further sorting [3], followed by
exocytosis [4]. Holotoxin is then released from the
primary uptake neuron and is able to enter a sec-
ondary neuron (shown in red) via either pathway: the
synaptic vesicle-dependent pathway (by binding
SV2), which leads to substrate cleavage, or the
synaptic vesicle-independent pathway (by binding
to alternative receptor[s]), which leads to further
propagation of the holotoxin into upstream neurons.
anti-TeNT antibody in the soma chamber
of a microfluidic device provides protec-
tion from substrate cleavage in secondary
neurons. We obtained similar results using the T-HC fragment.
These results directly demonstrate that TeNT physically leaves
the primary uptake neuron, is exposed to the extracellular milieu,
and then binds and enters another neuron, where it cleaves its
substrate. Hence, the reconstitution approach described here
made it possible to directly visualize the distal action of TeNT.
Parallel experiments using BoNT/A and BoNT/D revealed that
both of these serotypes were also intercepted, during inter-
neuronal transfer, by anti-toxin antibodies that prevent entry;
protection from substrate cleavage was also observed using
HC fragments. These findings demonstrate that these two sero-
types also undergo cell-to-cell transfer to exert distal effects.
Whether BoNTs B, C, G, and F spread within networks of neu-
rons is a question that has yet to be explored.
In the entry pathway that results in substrate cleavage, holo-
toxin is internalized by endocytosed SVs, and re-acidification
of the vesicle lumen leads to the irreversible separation of the
LC from the HC, as the LC is translocated into the cytosol. The
LC is then trapped inside the cell, and cell-to-cell propagation
of the holotoxin is no longer possible. Therefore, either entry of
the holotoxin into the retrograde pathway must involve sorting
away from recycling SVs before they acidify, or the holotoxins
are internalized via a distinct pathway. In order to address this
issue, we utilized neurons lacking the SV receptor, SV2. If SV2
serves as the only receptor for these toxins, entry would not be
observed in the KO cells. However, Qdot-labeled HC fragments
from all three toxins were able to enter SV2 KO neurons, clearly
establishing the existence of an alternative, SV2-independent,
entry pathway. Moreover, after entry, each of the Qdot-HC con-
jugates underwent axonal retrograde trafficking, with speeds
consistent with the signaling organelle that, as Schiavo and
Cell Reports 16, 1974–1987, August 16, 2016
1983
 co-workers have shown, transports TeNT, BoNT/A, and BoNT/E
(Restani et al., 2012a; Deinhardt et al., 2006). Additionally, this
organelle does not acidify, thus allowing for long-distance trans-
port of the holotoxin, in the absence of any translocation. We reit-
erate that BoNT/E undergoes retrograde traffic in the same
compartment that transports TeNT, BoNT/A (Restani et al.,
2012a), and BoNT/D (Figure 5). However, BoNT/E does not exert
distal effects (Antonucci et al., 2008; Restani et al., 2012a). Thus,
inclusion in this retrograde transport pathway does not always
necessitate interneuronal transfer, a point we return to further
below in the subsequent text. We also note that previous work
examined retrograde transport of BoNT/A and TeNT in primary
motor neurons (Restani et al., 2012a) (trafficking of BoNT/D
has not been studied before); the findings reported here extend
these observations to central neurons.
The identification of an alternative uptake pathway, indepen-
dent of recycling SVs, prompts the question of the identity of
the receptors that mediate entry into this pathway. FGFR3 and
nidogens 1 and 2 have been proposed to serve as alternative re-
ceptors for BoNT/A and TeNT, respectively (Jacky et al., 2013;
Bercsenyi et al., 2014). Therefore, we made use of the toxin-
binding domains of all three of these putative secondary receptor
molecules and determined whether these reagents inhibited
distal effects in microfluidic devices. We found that the FGFR3
fragment failed to block the distal effects of BoNT/A, indicating
that interactions with this receptor are not required for retro-
grade trafficking or toxin transfer. Surprisingly, a greater degree
of cleavage was observed in the proximal region of the soma
channel in the presence of the receptor fragment. The reasons
for this observation are unclear, but these results suggest that
the FGFR3 fragment might enhance entry via recycling SVs,
potentially by increasing the avidity of BoNT/A for the SV2-
ganglioside co-receptor. The FGFR3 fragment had no discern-
able effect on the action of either TeNT or BoNT/D. We then
turned our attention to the nidogen 1 and 2 peptides (Bercsenyi
et al., 2014), which were shown to protect mice from the effects
of TeNT. When added, in conjunction with TeNT, to the axon
side, protection in the proximal and distal regions of the soma
side was observed (the only case where this did not reach signif-
icance was for N1 in the proximal region of the soma channel).
These findings are consistent with the idea that nidogens play
a role in the distal effects of TeNT. Interestingly, the N2 peptide
also protected SNAP-25 from cleavage by BoNT/A, proximally
and distally, while N1 was without effect. Finally, neither nidogen
peptide had any discernable effect on the action of BoNT/D.
In conclusion, the CNTs studied here do not all enter the second-
ary SV2-independent uptake pathway via a single, common,
alternative receptor.
While the experiments summarized earlier indicate conver-
gent early sorting immediately following uptake via the secondary
pathway, it should also be noted that, after delivery to the somato-
dendritic compartment, the holotoxins are likely to undergo
further sorting and routing to distinct destinations. For example,
as mentioned earlier, BoNT/E is co-trafficked with TeNT and
BoNT/A in the same organelle toward the soma (Restani et al.,
2012a); however, BoNT/E does not exert distal effects (Antonucci
etal.,2008),indicatingthat,onceitisdeliveredtothecell body,itis
sorted away from the interneuronal transfer pathway. Similarly,
TeNT and cholera toxin have been reported to undergo co-trans-
port back to the soma, where they are sorted apart from one
another to distinct destinations: cholera toxin is trafficked to the
Golgi, while TeNT is targeted to the plasma membrane for exocy-
tosis (Schmieg et al., 2014). Putative sorting steps in the somato-
dendritic compartment are appealing in the context of the CNTs
due to the fact that TeNT causes rigid paralysis, while BoNTs
cause flaccid paralysis: these toxins might be routed to different
release sites to affect distinct constellations of upstream neurons.
However, it is also possible that BoNTs, akin to TeNT, can also
cause disinhibition in the spinal cord; this might have gone unde-
tected due to efficient inhibition of the NMJ by the same toxin.
Electrophysiological recordings from motor neurons in animals
challenged with BoNT/A will resolve this issue.
In summary, the experiments described here help to resolve
the controversy regarding distal effects of CNTs by directly visu-
alizing the interneuronal transfer and distal action of TeNT and of
BoNT/A and BoNT/D in central neurons. An important next step
in these studies will be to engineer the toxins so that they are able
to enter only the local pathway by mutating binding sites that
mediate recognition of the alternative receptor. At present, these
efforts can begin by focusing on interactions with nidogens for
TeNT, and perhaps for BoNT/A, but this work will await the iden-
tification of the secondary receptor for BoNT/D. A key question
will be whether such designer toxins are still efficacious in human
patients. If so, off-target effects can be avoided; if not, then many
of the clinical effects of these agents are, in fact, due to their
distal effects, and this will require a re-evaluation of how these
toxins are used in human patients.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement
All animal care and experiment protocols in this study were conducted under
the guidelines set by the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
handbook. The protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee (ACUC) at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (assurance
number: A3368-01).
Cell Culture
Rat or mouse hippocampal neurons were cultured as described previously
(Yeh et al., 2010). Hippocampal neurons were cultured in standard neuron
microfluidic devices (SND450, XONA Microfluidics) mounted on glass cover-
slips, as previously described (Taylor et al., 2005).
Treatments in Microfluidic Devices
For the experiments shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3, toxins (30 nM) were applied
to the axon side; axotomy was performed 2 hr before toxin treatment by rapid
aspiration and reperfusion of the axon chamber. Calcein-AM-red or -green,
was added to either side of the microfluidic devices at a final concentration
of 1 mM; when treating the axon side, dye was incubated for 5 hr before imag-
ing to allow the entire cell to become stained.
For the experiments shown in Figure 4, A-HC (300 nM), T-HC (300 nM),
D-HC (100 nM), control antibody, and anti-toxin antibodies were premixed
as specified in the Figure 4 legend and added to the soma side prior
to the axon treatment with, respectively, BoNT/A (30 nM), TeNT (30 nM),
or BoNT/D (10 nM). For the experiments shown in Figure 6, toxins were
premixed with either
their respective HC fragments or FGFR3bL2,3
(300 nM for BoNT/A and TeNT, and 100 nM for BoNT/D), or nidogen N1
or N2 peptides (20 mM each), incubated for 60 min at 37�C, and then
added to the axon side. After 24 hr, substrate cleavage was measured
via immunocytochemistry.

Cell Reports 16, 1974–1987, August 16, 2016
 For soma-side toxin treatments, neurons seeded on the soma side of a
microfluidic device were incubated with 10 nM of BoNT/A, BoNT/D, or TeNT
for 48 hr (for immunoblotting in Figure 1) or 24 hr (for immunocytochemistry
in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 6).
For all treatments, preconditioned media were removed from the micro-
fluidic chamber, mixed with an equal volume of fresh media, and used in the
treatments to follow. All control microfluidics were sham treated with precon-
ditioned media.
The fraction of neurons that project to the axon side (Figures 1 and S2) was
calculated using data from 20 separate chambers obtained from five indepen-
dent litters of rats.
Statistical Methods
Statistical significance was by determined by performing the Student’s
t test for all immunocytochemistry data analysis: ns = p > 0.05, *p %
0.05, **p % 0.01, ***p % 0.001, and ****p % 0.0001. An ANOVA with
Dunnett’s post hoc test was used to analyze and compare immunoblot
data, where p < 0.05.
