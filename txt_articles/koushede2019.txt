This study examined the psychometric properties of the Danish WEMWBS, and its short 
version (SWEMWBS) in a Danish population sample, and compared scores in Denmark with 
scores representative of three other European settings. A total of 3,508 Danish men and 
women aged 16-95 filled out an electronic survey. Face validity was examined by cognitive 
interviews. Content validity was assessed by examining response distributions and construct 
validity by confirmatory factor analysis, measurement invariance, and relations to other or 
similar measures. Overall mental well-being scores were calculated, as well as stratified by 
sex and age. Support was found for the single-factor hypothesis, yielding good model fits for 
both versions of the scale. Both scales have high internal consistency. Correlations with 
mental health measures were largely in line with expectations. The highest mental well-being 
scores were reported for Catalonia, followed by Denmark, Iceland, and England. The 
(S)WEMWBS appear to be appropriate instruments to measure mental well-being in the 
Danish population. The present findings encourage the use of the scales, particularly 
SWEMWBS, in epidemiological, intervention and evaluation studies in research and practice. 
Cross-cultural comparisons like the one reported here may be essential to inform international 
mental health policy.

1. Introduction  
 
 
Mental well-being is a concept regarded as encompassing dimensions of hedonic 
(positive feelings, affect, emotions) and eudemonic (positive functioning, mindset and 
relationships) well-being (Stewart-Brown, 2013). Over the past decade, interest in the concept 
of mental well-being has increased along with the recognition of its impact on public health 
(WHO, 2013). This has led to an increased interest among researchers, policymakers and 
service providers to improve knowledge about mental well-being measurement and 
application (Forsman et al., 2015; Huppert, 2014). In spite of mental well-being being closely 
connected to healthy life years and productivity, how to promote mental well-being has 
generally been under-researched, partly due to a lack of appropriate population-based 
measures (Huppert, 2014; Huppert and Whittington, 2003).  
 
The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) was developed in the 
United Kingdom (UK) to meet the need for a psychometrically robust measure that would 
enable monitoring of mental well-being in the general population and the evaluation of 
projects, programs and policies which aim to improve mental well-being (Stewart-Brown, 
2015; Tennant et al., 2007). Mental well-being is desirable in its own right and is also a 
modifiable determinant of longevity and a protective factor against future disease (Chida and 
Steptoe, 2008; Siahpush, Spittal, and Singh, 2008).  The scale covers both feeling and 
functioning aspects of mental well-being which it represents as the positive end of a 
continuum of mental health. Licenses to use WEMWBS are provided free on application.  
 
The scale is now widely used in the UK and other parts of Europe, where it is 
considered an appropriate tool to measure mental well-being (Stewart-Brown, 2015). The 
WEMWBS has been validated in various populations and among different subgroups

including adolescents, clinical samples and ethnic minority samples (McKay and Andretta, 
2017; Smith, Alves, Knapstad, Haug, and Aaro, 2017; Stewart-Brown, 2015; Stewart-Brown 
et al., 2011; Trousselard et al., 2016). The scale has been translated into more than a 25 
languages including Arabic, Urdu, Japanese and Chinese (Taggart, 2015), and validated in 
e.g. Norwegian, Swedish, Italian, Dutch, German, French and Spanish (Castellví et al., 2014; 
Forero et al., 2014; Haver, Akerjordet, Caputi, Furunes, and Magee, 2015; Smith et al., 2017; 
Taggart, 2015). Previous validation studies have found that the WEMWBS is considered easy 
to complete and that it provides a credible measure of mental well-being (Stewart-Brown, 
2015). The scale has also been found to be sensitive to the changes which occur in the context 
of a broad variety of well-being promotion initiatives (Stewart-Brown, 2015).  
 
Some validation studies suggest that item redundancy might be an issue for the 
WEMWBS leading to the development of the 7-item short WEMWBS (SWEMWBS) 
(Stewart-Brown et al., 2009). The SWEMWBS is preferred by some researchers in terms of 
its psychometric properties and convenience for monitoring mental well-being. However, the 
seven items in the SWEMWBS relate more to functioning than to feeling and therefore offer a 
slightly different perspective on mental well-being (Stewart-Brown, 2015). When content 
coverage is an issue, such as in research projects where for example the project or 
intervention aims to help participants develop their understanding of the concept of mental 
well-being, gathering data on the full 14-item scale may therefore be preferred (Stewart-
Brown et al., 2009). 
 
The (S)WEMWBS is a potentially promising scale for measuring mental well-being in 
Danish population studies. However, the (S)WEMWBS has not been validated in a Danish 
context. Validation of a scale in the national context in which it is meant to be used is

important in order to ensure its appropriateness in the specific setting. If validity of the 
(S)WEMWBS) can be ensured in a Danish setting, it would be of immense value as it would: 
a) provide a tool suitable for measuring mental well-being in population-based samples - in 
which there is currently a high demand; b) enable mental health promotion practitioners to 
evaluate their programmes using a practical mental well-being measure; and c) to conduct 
research on the distributions and predictors of mental well-being in order to inform experts 
and stakeholders relevant to national and international public mental health policy. 
 
1.1. Aim 
The aim of this study is to examine the psychometric properties and validate the 
original and the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale among a Danish 
population sample, as well as comparing mental well-being scores in Denmark with scores 
representative of three other European settings. 
 
2. Methods  
2.1. Study design 
We used data from a national cross-sectional survey The Danish Mental Health and 
Well-being Survey 2016 (Nielsen, Hinrichsen, Santini, and Koushede, 2017). The survey was 
carried out by Statistics Denmark. A random representative sample of Danish men and 
women aged 16 years and above was drawn from the Danish Civil Registration System. 
Statistics Denmark sent an electronic letter to the sampled individuals in October 2016 with 
information about the study and an invitation to participate. After a week a reminder letter 
was sent, and after yet another week a final reminder was sent.  
 
2.2. Sampling 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
7 
 
In total 5,050 men and 5,200 women were contacted. Out of them 1,656 men and 
1,852 women responded to the web-based survey resulting in a response rate of 33 % for men 
and 36 % for women. In terms of non-response, 5,854 did not respond to the invitation to 
participate, 463 only partially completed the survey, 183 refused to participate, 3 could not 
participate due to language barriers, 213 could not participate due to privacy protection, and 
26 could not participate due to medical conditions or disability.  
 
2.3. Ethics 
There is no formal agency for ethical approval of questionnaire-based survey studies 
in Denmark. The study complies with the Helsinki 2 declaration on ethics and is registered 
with the Danish Data Protection Authority, and confidentiality and privacy requirements were 
met. The participants‟ voluntary completion and return of the survey questionnaires 
constituted implied consent. 
 
2.4. Measures 
All measures included in this study were self-administered.  
 
2.4.1. 
(S)WEMWBS: The WEMWBS is a 14-item scale with 5 response categories, with a total 
score ranging from 14-70. The SWEMWBS consists of 7 items with a total score ranging 
from 7-35 (see table 2). The items are all positively worded. Respondents are required to 
describe their experience of each statement over the past two weeks using a 5-point Likert 
scale („none of the time‟, „rarely‟, „some of the time‟, „often‟, „all of the time‟). The overall 
WEMWBS score is calculated by summing the scores for each item, with equal weights. A 
higher WEMWBS score therefore indicates a higher level of mental well-being (Tennant et 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

al., 2007). The SWEMWBS is scored similarly by creating a sum scores for all the items with 
final scores transformed to enhance scaling properties (available online) (Stewart-Brown, 
2015). Participants were asked to respond to the 14-item scale, of which the same responses 
were used for the 7-item scale, i.e. participants were not asked to respond to the seven same 
items twice.  
 
The scale was translated into Danish in line with recommendations set forth by the 
World Health Organization for the translation and adaptation of scales, which includes 1) 
forward-translation, 2) expert panel back-translation, 3) pre-testing and cognitive 
interviewing, and 4) final version. The details of the translation methodology can be found 
elsewhere (WHO).  
 
2.4.2. 
Other measures 
Five additional measures were included in this study to assess relations to other 
variables. The measures were chosen to include similar concepts to the WEMWBS and 
concepts expected to be associated with mental well-being. The measures included for 
analysis were: 
 
2.4.2.1. 
WHO-5 (Topp, Ostergaard, Sondergaard, and Bech, 2015) covering overall well-being: 5 
items given a score from 0-5, then added up and multiplied by 4, and scored into a continuous 
scale 0-100, with high scores indicating high levels of mental well-being. 
2.4.2.2.

9 
 
Self-rated health: Single item for self-rated health which asks respondents to rate their 
overall health (physical as well as mental), five response categories from poor to excellent 
ranging from 1-5, higher scores indicate better self-rated health. The question is part of the 
Danish national health and morbidity surveys (Christensen, Davidsen, Ekholm, Pedersen, and 
Juel, 2014). 
2.4.2.3. 
Discomfort and pain: Six items for symptoms of discomfort and pain within the past two 
weeks in; Shoulder or neck; Back or lower back; Arms, hands, legs, knees, hips or joints; 
Headache; Stomach-ache; Difficulties sleeping. Each item coded 0 = symptom not present, 1 
= symptom present. Items added up to a scale ranging from 0-6, with higher scores indicating 
a higher number of symptoms. The questions are part of the Danish National Health and 
Morbidity surveys (Christensen et al., 2014). 
2.4.2.4. 
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein, 1983) covering 
perceived stress and coping: 10 items each given a score from 0-4. Positive items reversed, 
and added up into a scale ranging from 0-40, with higher scores indicating higher levels of 
perceived stress.  
2.4.2.5. 
The Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4): Data on poor 
mental health was collected using the PHQ-4 which asks participants about their experience 
of core depressive and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks as specified by DSM-IV 
(Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, and Lowe, 2009). There are 4 items for depression/anxiety, each 
item is given a score from 0-3, then scored into continuous scale 0-12, with higher scores 
indicating high level of depression/anxiety.

Other variables included in the present study were: sex, age, education, and 
employment.  
 
2.4.3. Steps of validation and statistical procedures 
Validation of the scales examined: 1) the face validity, 2) construct validity assessing 
goodness of fit and measurement invariance through confirmatory factor analysis, as well as 
relations to other or similar measures, 3) content validity including distribution of responses 
and potential floor and ceiling effects, 4) assessment of internal consistency. Quantitative 
analyses were completed using the statistical package R (R, 2018), and the Lavaan package 
for structural equation modelling (Rosseel, 2012).  
 
2.4.3.1. Face validity 
Cognitive interviewing techniques were used to examine the face validity of the scale 
(i.e. do people understand the questions in the way they were intended) and how participants 
process and respond to the scale. Eleven face-to-face interviews were conducted with six men 
and five women aged 20-77 years. Participants were selected striving for a variation on age, 
sex and education, attributes known to be associated with mental health and health literacy 
(Bo, Friis, Osborne, and Maindal, 2014; Christensen, Davidsen, Koushede, and Juel, 2017). 
Interview data was analysed using the Framework Approach based on the four stages 
(comprehension, retrieval, judgement, and response) of Tourangeau et al.‟s model for survey 
response (Tourangeau, Rips, and Rasinski, 2000).   
 
2.4.3.2. Construct validity  
Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) based unweighted least squares means and 
variance adjusted (ULSMV) was performed to assess goodness of fit and measurement

invariance for a single-factor model of both the Danish WEMWBS and SWEMWBS. To 
enhance cross-validity of the analyses, two independent subsets were randomly created for 
assessing global fit (n = 1150) and measurement invariance (n = 2358). As recommended by 
Hoyle and Panter (1995), several fit indices were used including the Root Mean Square Error 
of Approximation (RMSEA), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the Tucker-Lewis Index 
(TLI). Values greater than 0.95 for the CFI and TLI were considered to reflect good model fit. 
A RMSEA value of 0.06 or less is considered to indicate a good fit, although values up to 
0.08 were considered acceptable (Hu and Bentler, 1999; Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1993). 
Measurement invariance was evaluated across sex (women vs. men) and age groups (16-54 
years of age vs. 55+) performing a Likelihood-Ratio Test (LRT). 
Criterion validity was assessed by calculating correlations between the WEMWBS 
scores and the SWEMWBS scores. Convergent validity was assessed by calculating 
correlations between the (S)WEMWBS and WHO-5. Discriminant validity was assessed by 
calculating correlations between the (S)WEMWBS and Self-rated health (SRH), education, 
symptoms of discomfort and pain, PSS, and PHQ-4. We hypothesized that the (S)WEMWBS 
scores would show a strong positive correlation with the positively phrased measure of 
general well-being (WHO-5) (Tennant et al., 2007), moderate positive association with SRH 
(McKay and Andretta, 2017), and moderate negative associations with scales measuring the 
negative aspects of physical or mental health status (symptoms of discomfort and pain, PSS 
and PHQ-4) (McKay and Andretta, 2017) (based on Cohen‟s rule of thumb, i.e. small: r = 0.1; 
moderate = 0.3; large = 0.5 (Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken, 2003)). 
Based on the findings of recent Danish health and morbidity studies we hypothesized 
that men would show a higher score than women on the (S)WEMWBS and that the scales 
would show a positive association with education (Christensen et al., 2014; Christensen et al., 
2017). The latter association was hypothesized to be mild to moderate based on recent studies 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

12 
 
suggesting that mental well-being is less sensitive to socioeconomic patterning compared to 
poor mental health (Nielsen et al., 2016). Differences in scores across sex and education were 
assessed using linear regression analysis. 
 
2.4.3.3. Content validity 
The distribution of responses highlighted the frequency of popular responses and any 
floor and ceiling effects. Total scores were examined for floor and ceiling effects. Instruments 
exhibit floor or ceiling effects if more than 15% of participants record the lowest or highest 
score (McHorney and Tarlov, 1995).  
 
2.4.3.4. Internal consistency 
Cronbach's α and McDonald‟s ω were calculated as reliability indices of the total 
scores. Internal consistency estimates of > 0.70 were sought (Bagozzi and Yi, 2012). 
 
2.4.3.5. Cross-cultural comparison of mental well-being scores 
Total (S)WEMWBS scores were computed with weights applied to generate nationally 
representative estimates. The Danish mental well-being scores were reported along with 
scores based on data representative of three other European settings, specifically Iceland, 
England, UK, and Catalonia, Spain. Overall scores were reported as well as scores stratified 
by age and sex. Information regarding survey and sampling in Iceland, England, and 
Catalonia is provided in Appendix 1.  
 
3. Results 
3.1. Participant characteristics 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

13 
 
319 (9.1%) were 16-25 years old, 735 (21.0%) were 26-44 years old, 1,437 (41.0%) 
were 45-64 years old, and 1,017 (28.9%) were 65-95. The mean age was 52.1 years. Among 
participants 2,528 (72.0%) were either married or living with a partner. 1,919 (54.7%) were 
employed, and 1,220 (34.8%) were educated beyond youth education (For more information 
on the demographic distribution see table 1). 
 
3.2. Face validity  
Participants found the scales easy to complete with no major problems in terms of 
understanding. All items are shown in table 2. Item b) I have been feeling useful and item l) I 
have been feeling loved evoked a few comments on the ambiguity caused by the context 
sensitiveness of the questions (i.e. have I been feeling useful or loved at work, in school, in 
my family or as a citizen?). The concepts of feeling useful and loved were understood 
consistently among participants. Further, the wording used for item n) (cheerful in Danish 
translated into fornøjet) was considered outdated or quirky. Nevertheless, participants felt 
able to provide an answer. The recall time-scale of the previous two weeks was considered 
appropriate. Some participants mentioned not using the outermost answer categories, because 
they considered it unrealistic to feel a certain way all of the time.  
 
3.3. Construct validity 
We conducted a CFA on the long and short versions of the WEMWBS scale. We 
obtained good model fit for both the WEMWBS (χ2 (77) = 1037.7, CFI = 0.998; TLI = 0.986; 
RMSEA = 0.063) and the SWEMWBS (χ2 (14) = 227.8, CFI = 0.990; TLI = 0.984; RMSEA 
= 0.065). Table 3 illustrates all model fit results. 
Strong measurement invariance (see table 4) was sustainable for both sex and age 
groups on both scales. Difference in factor mean was significant across age groups, with a 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
14 
 
lower latent score for the younger population (-0.193, z = -4.28, p < 0.001) but there were no 
significant differences between men and women (0.049,  z = 1.06, p = 0.29). This latent trend 
is consistent with observed scores. 
As can be seen from Table 5, the correlation between the original and short form 
showed that 92% of the variation in the WEMWBS is explained by the 7 items in the 
SWEMWBS. In terms of convergent validity, as expected, the (S)WEMWBS correlated 
positively and more strongly with the WHO-5 than with other measures. In terms of 
discriminant validity, there was a strong negative correlation with the PHQ-4 and the PSS, a 
positive moderate correlation with self-rated health, and a negative moderate correlation with 
symptoms of discomfort and pain. Finally, there was a statistically significant but weak 
correlation between (S)WEMWBS and education.  
 
3.4. Content validity 
In histograms, the WEMWBS and SWEMWBS total scores appeared to be normally 
distributed (figures not shown). Neither floor nor ceiling effects were observed for the scales 
(results not shown).  
 
3.5. Internal consistency  
Both the WEMWBS and the SWEMWBS showed high internal consistency in the 
total sample (WEMWBS: α = 0.94, ω = 0.92; SWEMWBS: α = 0.88, ω = 0.85). The internal 
consistency of the (S)WEMWBS scales can be seen in table 5.  
 
3.6. Cross-cultural comparison of mental well-being scores 
Table 6 shows the (S)WEMWBS scores in Denmark, as well as in Iceland, England, 
UK, and Catalonia, Spain. Mean (SD) scores for the total scales in Denmark were 52.2 (8.7) 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
15 
 
for the WEMWBS, and 26.4 (4.31) for the SWEMWBS. The difference between WEMWBS 
scores in relation to sex were significant, with men scoring slightly higher than women (men: 
M = 52.6, SD = 8.7; women: M = 51.9, SD = 8.7, p = 0.047). No sex differences in mental 
well-being was found on the SWEMWBS scale (men: M = 24.3, SD = 3.81; women: M = 
24.1, SD = 3.93, p = 0.164).  
The highest overall mental well-being scores were reported for Catalonia, followed by 
Denmark, Iceland, and England. Differences between geographical locations exceeded 
estimates of minimally important differences for WEMWBS in Catalonia (Maheswaran, 
Weich, Powell, and Stewart-Brown, 2012), and between England and both Iceland and 
Denmark for SWEMWBS (Shah, Cader, Andrews, Wikijsera, and Stewart-Brown, under 
review). Consistently, men reported slightly higher mental well-being scores than women in 
all four countries/regions. In terms of age differences, scores rose with age in northern 
settings, but fell with age in Catalonia.  
 
4. Discussion  
To our knowledge this is the first study to analyse the validity of the (S)WEMWBS in 
Denmark. This study included a large sample size with representatives from all social groups 
above the age of 16. Some limitations deserve mentioning. The response rate was 34 percent 
and while this is not unusual for web based surveys (Christensen, Bekker-Jeppesen, Jensen, 
and Juel, 2016), selection bias cannot be ruled out. Regarding the comparison of well-being 
scores with other European data, there were some minor discrepancies particularly in terms of 
the year of the survey, the age groups, and the lowest age for participation in each survey. 
Also, since this study set out to validate (S)WEMWBS in the Danish context, we did not test 
for measurement invariance across all four European settings. These limitations should be 
kept in mind when interpreting the results.

In line with previous studies our study showed that the (S)WEMWBS were considered 
easy to complete and to provide a credible measure of mental well-being (Stewart-Brown, 
2015). The original WEMWBS scale was developed as an instrument for assessment in the 
general population fitting a one-factor model. The factor analysis conducted in our study 
showed that a single factor adequately confirmed item relationships with good model fit for 
both scales. SWEMWBS explained a substantial amount of the variance in WEMWBS and 
may therefore be preferred. As shown by the measurement invariance tests, the (S)WEMWBS 
could be used to compare parameter estimates over sex and age. Age was shown to be a 
source of population heterogeneity, which should be taken into account if (S)WEBWBS is 
used specifically for the purpose of comparing individual differences (rather than population 
differences) in scores between people belonging to different age groups. 
Reliability estimates displayed high internal consistency for both the original and the 
short scale. The (S)WEMWBS did not show a ceiling effect in our sample, indicating that the 
scales have the potential for detecting overall improvement in mental well-being in the 
population. The results from the convergent and discriminant validity tests suggest that the 
(S)WEMWBS share common features with the WHO-5, and are inversely related to the PSS 
and the PHQ-4, in line with the original validation study (Tennant et al., 2007).  
The (S)WEMWBS have proved very popular both in their country of origin and 
internationally (Shah, Steiner, Petrou, Johnson, and Stewart-Brown, in press) because they 
have enabled studies of risk and protective factors for mental well-being as well as 
intervention evaluation. Cognitive interviews with the general public confirm that the range of 
items in these measures offers a recognisable picture of a previously unfamiliar concept 
(Stewart-Brown, 2013). This is likely an important component of the scale‟s popularity in 
supporting research and evaluation in subtle ways that are hard to measure. The scales have 
proved responsive to change in evaluation studies (Maheswaran et al., 2012; Shah et al., under

review) and also in RCTs (Shah et al., in press). Studies of risk and protective factors suggest, 
surprisingly, that mental well-being is much less strongly associated with socio-demographic 
factors and health related lifestyles than mental illness (Ng Fat, Scholes, Boniface, Mindell, 
and Stewart-Brown, 2017; Stewart-Brown, Samaraweera, Taggart, Kandala, and Stranges, 
2015; Stranges, Samaraweera, Taggart, Kandala, and Stewart-Brown, 2014). Studies on 
adolescents, using other measures of mental well-being, have confirmed that this is also likely 
to be true in Denmark (Nielsen et al., 2016). This study now makes it possible to investigate 
distributions of mental well-being in the Danish population. 
Finally, this study provided comparative mental well-being scores across four 
European settings, suggesting that population norms for mental well-being are higher in 
Catalonia compared to Denmark, Iceland, and England. This is in contrast to the World 
Happiness Reports that have consistently ranked the Nordic countries highest on well-being 
(assessed by the Cantril ladder) (World Happiness Report, 2017) and the European Social 
Survey (ESS) where Denmark ranked highest (assessed by hedonic and eudemonic measures 
separately), followed by Iceland, the UK, and finally Spain (ESS, 2015). The World 
Happiness Reports evaluate participants‟ views of „the best possible life for them‟ which 
elicits views on hedonic wellbeing or life satisfaction. It has recently been shown that in spite 
of the Nordic countries ranking highest in the World Happiness Reports, significant 
struggling or suffering minorities have been masked by these results (Andreasson and 
Birkjær, 2018), suggesting that measures of life satisfaction are insufficient as indicators of 
national happiness. This may in part explain the differences in ratings between our study and 
those reported in the World Happiness Reports. The ESS evaluates both hedonic and 
eudemonic wellbeing, finding a high correlation between the two, but with greater between-
country variation in hedonic wellbeing as compared to eudemonic wellbeing. The 
(S)WEMWBS combine hedonic and eudemonic wellbeing in one overall score, possibly

accounting for the differences in our findings compared to the findings reported in the ESS. It 
may also be considered that the relatively high mental wellbeing scores found for Catalonia 
compared to those reported in the aforementioned studies may be related to within-country 
variation, i.e. other studies reported on Spain as a whole rather than Catalonia in isolation. 
Catalonia is a region quite distinct from the rest of Spain, with considerable differences in 
ethnicity, cultural values and economic conditions, and it is possible that these differences 
may explain our findings rather than the properties of the different measures. That said, we 
were not able to identify any other studies indicating that mental wellbeing is considerably 
better in Catalonia than in the rest of Spain. Finally, due to the different sources of survey 
data, we could not test for measurement invariance across the four settings, and we cannot 
rule out that this could also have had implications for the findings. Thus, explanations for the 
reasons behind the differences in ratings between our study and the aforementioned reports 
remain speculative.  
Different measures capture different constructs. It is important to understand the 
differences between them and their underlying mechanisms in relation to these different 
measures in order to guide policy and practice most appropriately. Comparison of mental 
well-being scores across different European settings offer valuable insights that might 
otherwise be unknown, as well as allowing research into risk and protective factors that vary 
between countries. Such research is strongly needed to inform international mental health 
policy, and scales that are valid across cultures and languages are essential to support this 
research. Further, multicultural validity testing is warranted to examine how (S)WEMWBS 
functions across different cultural settings.

The (S)WEMWBS are shown to be valid and appropriate instruments to measure well-
being in the Danish population. The present findings encourage the use of these measures in 
epidemiological, intervention and evaluation studies, where they are likely to be valuable for 
research as well as practice. While the WEMWBS scale may be used, the short version 
explains a substantial amount of the original scale, and may be preferred for the sake of 
practicality. The highest mental well-being scores were reported for Catalonia, followed by 
Denmark, Iceland, and England. Our findings offer insights into distributions of mental well-
being on a global level that would otherwise likely remain unknown. Future cross-national 
investigations are therefore strongly warranted, as they may be essential to inform 
international mental health policy.

Appendix 
Data sources, designs, and samples.  
 
Iceland: 
Data on wellbeing using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale 
(SWEMWBS) were extracted from the survey Health and Wellbeing of Icelanders 2017, 
which was conducted in October 2017. Health and Wellbeing of Icelanders 2017 is a national 
questionnaire survey among 9887 randomly selected Icelanders, 18 years and older of which 
6.776 (68,5 %) participated and 6.344 (64,2%) completed SWEMWBS. 
England, UK: 
Data on well-being using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) 
were extracted from the Health Survey England 2016 (HSE). HSE 2016 survey sampled one 
dwelling unit from 9558 addresses randomly selected from 531 postcode sectors to provide a 
representative sample of adults (>16 years) living in private households. All consenting adults 
living in the sample dwelling units were interviewed. 8011 adults were interviewed, 55% of 
those approached. Of these 7071 (88.3%) completed WEMWBS. 
Catalonia, Spain: 
The Spanish version of the WEMWBS was administered to a representative sample of non-
institutionalized general population 15 years or older in Catalonia, a northeastern region of 
Spain with about 7.5 million inhabitants, as part of the 2016 Catalan Health Interview Survey 
(CHIS) Waves 12 and 13. The sample was selected using a stratified multistage random 
sampling design. Computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) were carried out by trained 
interviewers at the respondents‟ households from January 2016 to February 2017.
