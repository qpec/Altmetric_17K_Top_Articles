Flaws in the design of randomized trials may bias intervention effect estimates and increase between-trial het-
erogeneity. Empirical evidence suggests that these problems are greatest for subjectively assessed outcomes.
For the Risk of Bias in Evidence Synthesis (ROBES) Study, we extracted risk-of-bias judgements (for sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and incomplete data) from a large collection of meta-analyses pub-
lished in the Cochrane Library (issue 4; April 2011). We categorized outcome measures as mortality, other objec-
tive outcome, or subjective outcome, and we estimated associations of bias judgements with intervention effect
estimates using Bayesian hierarchical models. Among 2,443 randomized trials in 228 meta-analyses, intervention
effect estimates were, on average, exaggerated in trials with high or unclear (versus low) risk-of-bias judgements
for sequence generation (ratio of odds ratios (ROR) = 0.91, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.86, 0.98), allocation con-
cealment (ROR = 0.92, 95% CrI: 0.86, 0.98), and blinding (ROR = 0.87, 95% CrI: 0.80, 0.93). In contrast to previous
work, we did not observe consistently different bias for subjective outcomes compared with mortality. However, we
found an increase in between-trial heterogeneity associated with lack of blinding in meta-analyses with subjective
outcomes. Inconsistency in criteria for risk-of-bias judgements applied by individual reviewers is a likely limitation
of routinely collected bias assessments. Inadequate randomization and lack of blinding may lead to exaggeration
of intervention effect estimates in randomized trials.

Meta-analyses of randomized trials are often more influential
than single trials, and they increasingly inform health-care deci-
sions made by clinicians and health authorities. For their results
to be valid, randomized trials should employ rigorous methods
that can achieve and preserve comparability of the intervention
and control groups (1). For example, concealment of random-
ized allocation prevents an influence of patient characteristics
on allocation to intervention and control groups; blinding of
participants and trial personnel prevents differences in patient
management between groups; and blinding of outcome asses-
sors prevents knowledge of the assigned intervention group
influencing outcome measurement. Randomized trials vary in
methodological rigor, and flaws in trial conduct can lead to
biased estimation of the intervention effect (2). Systematic
reviewers should therefore assess the risk of bias in inter-
vention effect estimates from each included trial.
Meta-epidemiologic studies analyze collections of meta-
analyses to provide empirical evidence about the influence
of trial design characteristics on trial results (3). Such studies
have, however, reached differing conclusions about which
trial design characteristics most influence their results (4–8).
For example, 4 studies found that lack of adequate allocation
concealment was associated with overestimation of treatment
effect (9–12), while several other studies did not find evidence
for this (4, 5, 13–15). In a previous study, we explored reasons
for these discrepancies by combining data from 7 meta-
epidemiologic studies (16, 17). To our knowledge, this was
the first study to explore the effects of bias on between– and

 within–meta-analysis heterogeneity using Bayesian hierar-
chical models. The results suggested that trial results based on
subjectively assessed outcomes are more susceptible to bias
and that the effect of bias is unpredictable, leading to increased
heterogeneity in meta-analyses assessing subjective outcomes
(16, 17). Further investigation of the effects of trial character-
istics across different interventions, settings, and outcomes in
larger collections of meta-analyses (not previously used) may
provide more clarity and resolve inconsistencies between pre-
vious empirical studies.
Since January 2008, authors of Cochrane reviews have used
a “risk-of-bias” tool for assessing included trials (18). The
assessors make judgements in relation to “sequence generation,”
“allocation concealment,” “blinding of participants, personnel,
and outcome assessors,” “incomplete outcome data,” “selective
outcome reporting,” and a general category of “other potential
threats to validity.” For each of these areas, review authors
record whether there was a judgement of low, high, or unclear
risk of bias for each trial, together with comments or quotes to
justify each judgement. Accumulated standardized risk-of-
bias assessments are a potentially useful resource for meta-
epidemiologic research.
In this paper, we describe and report the main results from a
new, large empirical study investigating the associations of
risk-of-bias judgements for sequence generation, allocation
concealment, blinding, and incomplete outcome data with
treatment effect estimates— the Risk of Bias in Evidence Syn-
thesis (ROBES) Study. Our aims were to examine whether
routinely collected risk-of-bias assessments relating to meth-
odological characteristics are associated with effect estimates,
to compare these associations with findings from our previous
study (17), and to examine further the effect of outcome types
in a new collection of meta-analyses.
METHODS
Data source
The April 2011 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews (issue 4) included 4,371 intervention reviews (exclud-
ing protocols), of which 1,399 had at least 2 completed domains
in the Risk of Bias tables. The complete 1,399 reviews were
supplied by the Cochrane Informatics and Knowledge Manage-
ment Department in electronic format, as Review Manager (ver-
sion 5.0) files (19). We converted these to a customized Microsoft
Access database (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington)
using bespoke software which we commissioned from Riskaware
Ltd. (Bristol, United Kingdom).
Data selection and categorization
We selected meta-analyses that fulfilled the following criteria:
1) address a binary outcome; 2) include at least 5 randomized
trials, each with at least 1 event across the 2 trial arms; 3) accom-
panied by risk-of-bias assessments, with all 5 core domains
of the tool having been assessed (sequence generation, alloca-
tion concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selec-
tive outcome reporting); 4) compare an active intervention with
a control or “older” intervention; and 5) include no trials that
overlap with another meta-analysis in the data set. Details of the
process for selecting eligible meta-analyses are provided in
Web Appendix 1 (available at https://academic.oup.com/aje).
Meta-analyses can inform estimation of the bias associated with
a particular domain only if they contain at least 1 trial at “low
risk” of bias and 1 at “high or unclear” risk of bias. We refer
to these as informative meta-analyses for that bias domain.
We categorized each meta-analysis according to objectiv-
ity of the outcome measure (see below), direction of outcome
(adverse or favorable) (16, 17), type of intervention (pharmaco-
logical, surgical, psychosocial and behavioral, care pathways, or
other), clinical area (based on the World Health Organization’s
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) (20),
and whether the comparator was an active intervention (i.e., not
a placebo, untreated, or standard care). Classification of out-
come measure objectivity followed the method of Savovi´
c et al.
(16, 17): We categorized outcome measures as 1) all-cause mor-
tality; 2) other objectively assessed outcome (including live
birth, noncephalic birth, low birth weight, miscarriage, preg-
nancy, and all automated laboratory outcomes); 3) semiobjec-
tive outcome (where the outcome event is considered to be
measured accurately but the decision behind it is influenced by
a clinician’s or patient’s judgement (e.g., hospital admission or
readmission, study dropout/withdrawal for any reason, treat-
ment completion, cesarean delivery, spontaneous vaginal birth,
operative/assisted delivery, conversion to open surgery, addi-
tional treatments administered)); or 4) subjectively assessed
outcome (e.g., clinician-assessed outcomes, symptoms and
symptom scores, pain, mental health outcomes, cause-specific
mortality). Too few meta-analyses had outcomes in the objec-
tive and semiobjective categories (categories 2 and 3) for sepa-
rate analyses to be possible, so we combined these categories as
“other objective.” When both objective and subjective methods
of outcome assessment were used in different trials contributing
to the same meta-analysis, the meta-analysis was categorized as
having a subjectively assessed outcome (e.g., some trials in meta-
analyses examining smoking cessation used a laboratory measure,
while others used patient self-reporting).
Statistical analysis
To explore correlations between bias domains, we computed
odds ratios for the association between risk-of-bias judgements
for pairs of domains using logistic regression in Stata 14 (Stata-
Corp LP, College Station, Texas). For the main analyses, we
modeled intervention effects as log odds ratios with outcomes
coded so that odds ratios less than 1 corresponded to beneficial
intervention effects in all meta-analyses. In the main analysis,
“high risk” and “unclear risk” bias judgements were grouped
together. The underlying idea of the analysis is described in
Web Appendix 2 and illustrated in Web Figure 1.
We fitted Bayesian hierarchical bias models, assuming a
binomial likelihood (“model 3” by Welton et al. (21)). This as-
sumes random intervention effects (between-trial heterogene-
ity) within meta-analyses, which allows us to assess whether
individual bias domains are associated with increased heteroge-
neity. The model includes parameters for average bias in inter-
vention effects (log odds ratios comparing trials at “high or
unclear” risk of bias with “low” risk of bias, averaged across all
meta-analyses) and 2 sources of variation in bias. Variation in
bias among trials within meta-analyses was quantified using a

 κ2 term representing the average increase in between-trial het-
erogeneity in trials at “high or unclear” risk of bias (vs. “low”
risk of bias) for each bias domain. Variation in mean bias
across meta-analyses was quantified by a measure of between–
meta-analysis variance, φ2. Posterior mean values for aver-
age bias were exponentiated and are reported as the ratio of
odds ratios; posterior median values for κ and φ are reported
on the log odds ratio scale. All are presented with 95% credi-
ble intervals. Meta-analyses containing fewer than 2 studies at
“low risk” of bias and at “high or unclear” risk of bias are
uninformative for κ and thus were prevented from influencing
the estimation of this parameter. Additional statistical analysis
information and analysis code is provided in Web Appen-
dix 2.
We conducted univariable analyses for each of 4 risk-of-
bias domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding, and incomplete outcome data) using all informative
meta-analyses for that domain (model A in Web Appendix 2).
We did not explore the association between the selective out-
come reporting domain and intervention effect estimates. This
domain currently addresses the nonreporting of outcomes
rather than bias in the results available for meta-analysis, so it
is not directly relevant to bias in the observed results. Analyses
were also stratified according to type of outcome measure (all-
cause mortality, other objectively assessed, and subjectively
assessed). Multivariable analyses were based on an extended
model assuming distinct variance components associated with
each bias domain (model B in Web Appendix 2), described
elsewhere by Savovi´
c et al. (16). We also fitted multivariable
analyses that allowed interactions between sequence genera-
tion and allocation concealment, allocation concealment and
blinding, and sequence generation and blinding (model C
in Web Appendix 2). We conducted a univariable sensitivity
analysis combining trials with an “unclear” risk-of-bias judge-
ment with those with “low risk” of bias (rather than with “high
risk”). We also conducted separate analyses for objective and
semiobjective outcomes.
RESULTS
Following our selection process, the final ROBES Study
data set consisted of 228 meta-analyses containing 2,443 ran-
domized trials (Figure 1). The full list of included reviews and
meta-analysis is provided in Web Appendix 3. The median year
of publication of included reviews was 2008 (interquartile range
(IQR), 2005–2010; range, 1996–2011), and for trials it was 1999
(IQR, 1992–2005, range, 1950–2011). The median sample size
was 1,290 (IQR, 676–3,403; range, 110–341,351) for meta-
analyses and 114 (IQR, 60–256; range, 8–182,000) for trials.
Based on the categorization of clinical areas in the International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, the most frequently
assessed conditions were related to pregnancy and childbirth
(28 meta-analyses; 12.3%) and mental health (27 meta-analy-
ses; 11.8%), followed by circulatory system conditions (21
meta-analyses; 9.2%) and respiratory system conditions (20
meta-analyses; 8.8%). Subjectively assessed outcomes were re-
ported most frequently, in 127 (55.7%) meta-analyses, followed
by all-cause mortality (42 meta-analyses; 18.4%) (Table 1).
The proportion of trials judged as being at low risk of bias
was highest for the incomplete outcome data domain (1,493
trials; 61.1%), followed by sequence generation (1,143 trials;
46.8%), blinding (1,119 trials; 45.8%), and allocation conceal-
ment (1,033 trials; 42.3%). The proportion of trials with unclear
risk of bias was highest for allocation concealment (1,267 trials;
51.9%) and sequence generation (1,226 trials; 50.2%) and was
markedly lower for blinding (641 trials; 26.2%) and incomplete
outcome data (580 trials; 23.7%). The proportion of trials rated
as being at high risk of bias was highest for blinding (683 trials;
28.0%), followed by incomplete outcome data (370 trials;
15.2%), with low proportions rated as high risk for alloca-
tion concealment (143 trials; 5.9%) and sequence generation
(74 trials; 3.0%) (Table 2). Numbers of trials with each combi-
nation of the 4 risk-of-bias domain judgements are shown by
type of outcome in Web Figure 2.
For sequence generation, 2,158 trials were included in 189
(82.9%) informative meta-analyses, of which 1,006 (46.6%)
were judged as having low risk of bias, 1,081 (50.1%) as having
unclear risk of bias, and 71 (3.3%) as having high risk of bias.
For allocation concealment, 2,121 trials were included in
188 (82.5%) informative meta-analyses, of which 933 (44.0%)
were judged as having low, 1,068 (50.3%) as having unclear,
and 120 (5.7%) as having high risk of bias. Only 144 (63.2%)
meta-analyses (1,678 trials) were informative for blinding:
854 (50.9%) trials were judged as low, 437 (26.0%) as unclear,
and 387 (23.1%) as high risk of bias. For incomplete outcome
data, 1,956 trials were included in 167 (73.2%) informative
meta-analyses: 1,156 (59.1%) were judged as low, 475 (24.3%)
as unclear, and 325 (16.6%) as high risk of bias.
There was a strong association between judgements of low
risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment
(odds ratio = 10.4, 95% confidence interval: 8.6, 12.5) (Table 3).
Odds ratios for this association were consistent across types of
outcome variables. Associations between low-risk-of-bias judge-
ments for the other 5 pairs of domains were of smaller magnitude;
odds ratios across all trials varied between 1.8 and 2.9 (Table 3).
Table 4 and Web Figure 3 show results from univariable
analyses (based on model A). Intervention effect estimates
were exaggerated by an average of 9% in trials judged as
being at high or unclear risk of bias for sequence generation
(ratio of odds ratios (ROR) = 0.91, 95% credible interval (CrI):
0.86, 0.98). There was only a modest increase in between-
trial heterogeneity among such trials compared with trials at
low risk of bias (standard deviations (SDs) differed by 0.09
(95% CrI: 0.02, 0.21)). Mean bias varied between meta-
analyses, although this variability was imprecisely esti-
mated (SD, 0.10 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.20); Table 4). There was
no convincing evidence that the magnitude of average bias dif-
fered according to the type of outcome. Meta-analyses with sub-
jective outcomes contributed the most data to the analysis,
and the average bias among these studies was similar to the
overall result (ROR = 0.90, 95% CrI: 0.83, 0.98). In multivari-
able analyses (based on model B), the association between risk-
of-bias judgement and intervention effect estimate was attenu-
ated after adjusting for risk-of-bias judgements for allocation
concealment, blinding, and incomplete outcome data (ROR =
0.95, 95% CrI: 0.89, 1.03). The average bias was similar across
all outcome types (Table 5, Web Figure 4).

 Because there was a strong association between sequence
generation and allocation concealment, the estimates of aver-
age bias for these 2 domains may be expected to be similar.
Intervention effect estimates were exaggerated by an average
of 8% (ROR = 0.92, 95% CrI: 0.86, 0.98) in trials judged to
be at high or unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment,
but there was very little evidence of an increase in between-
trial heterogeneity (SDs differed by 0.05 (95% CrI: 0.01,
0.15)). The variability in average bias across meta-analyses
was small (SD, 0.05 (95% CrI: 0.01, 0.17)). There was little

 evidence that the average bias varied according to type of out-
come. Estimates of both between-trial and between–meta-analysis
heterogeneity in bias were low for all outcome types. As for
sequence generation, the analysis including adjustment for
the other 3 domains (model B) produced an attenuated estimate
of average bias (ROR = 0.96, 95% CrI: 0.88, 1.03), and the esti-
mates were very similar across all outcome types (Table 5, Web
Figure 4).
Intervention effect estimates were exaggerated by an average
of 13% (ROR = 0.87, 95% CrI: 0.80, 0.93) in trials judged to
be at high or unclear risk of bias for blinding. Between-trial het-
erogeneity was modestly increased for such studies (SDs dif-
fered by 0.10 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.25)), and average bias varied
between meta-analyses (SD, 0.12 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.24)). There
was little evidence that intervention effects differed according
to type of outcome. Increases in between-trial heterogeneity
(SDs differed by 0.22 (95% CrI: 0.04, 0.36)) and between–
meta-analysis heterogeneity in average bias (SD, 0.19 (95%
CrI: 0.03, 0.34)) appeared greater in meta-analyses asses-
sing subjective outcomes than for all-cause mortality or
other objective outcomes. In adjusted analysis (model B), the
estimated effect of high or unclear risk of bias due to blinding
was similar to the unadjusted estimate (ROR = 0.88, 95% CrI:
0.81, 0.94).
There was little evidence that intervention effects were exag-
gerated in trials judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias for
incomplete outcome data (ROR = 0.98, 95% CrI: 0.92, 1.05).
The corresponding estimated increase in between-trial hetero-
geneity was small (SDs differed by 0.05 (95% CrI: 0.01, 0.15)).
There was little evidence that average bias or increases in between-
trial heterogeneity varied according to type of outcome. The
adjusted estimates were very similar to the unadjusted estimates
(Table 5, Web Figure 4).
The results of the sensitivity analysis (model A) in which
trials with an unclear risk-of-bias judgement were combined
with those at low risk of bias are shown in Web Table 1. The
average intervention effects in meta-analyses with high risk of
bias for blinding compared with those with low or unclear risk
of bias were exaggerated, on average, by 13% (ROR = 0.87,
95% CrI: 0.79, 0.95), consistent with the main analysis. For the
other 3 bias domains, the 95% credible intervals for estimates of
average bias included the null. These analyses included fewer
informative meta-analyses, especially for sequence generation
and allocation concealment, and consequently the estimates had
wider credible intervals. Estimated increases in between-trial
heterogeneity were larger for sequence generation, compared
with those observed in the main analysis.
The separate estimates for subgroups of meta-analyses
with “other objective” and “semiobjective” outcomes (which
were analyzed together in the main analysis) were similar to
each other for allocation concealment and blinding. They dif-
fered somewhat for sequence generation (ROR = 0.85 (95%
CrI: 0.67, 1.09) for other objective outcomes and ROR =
1.08 (95% CrI: 0.91, 1.34) for semiobjective outcomes) and
incomplete outcome data (ROR = 0.94 (95% CrI: 0.72, 1.22)
for other objective outcomes and ROR = 1.11 (95% CrI: 0.93,
1.30) for semiobjective outcomes), but the credible intervals
were wide and overlapping (Web Table 2).

 In multivariable models with interaction terms (model C),
an interaction was observed between allocation concealment
and blinding (ROR = 0.84, 95% CrI: 0.74, 0.96) and between
sequence generation and blinding (ROR = 0.77, 95% CrI:
0.66, 0.91) (Web Table 3). This means that lack of blinding
may introduce greater bias in estimation of intervention effects
within studies with inadequate randomization than within stud-
ies with adequate randomization.
DISCUSSION
Using a collection of 2,443 randomized trials included in
228 meta-analyses, our estimates of the association between
average intervention effect estimates and routinely collected
risk-of-bias judgements for sequence generation, allocation
concealment, blinding, and incomplete outcome data confirm
that problems with randomization and a lack of blinding are,
on average, associated with a modest (around 10%) exaggeration
of treatment effect estimates. Lack of blinding appears to have
the largest influence on treatment effect estimates, and this re-
mains after adjustment for other domains. There was little evi-
dence that these biases varied according to the type of outcome
measure assessed. Although there were some differences in
the ratios of odds ratios for different outcome types in uni-
variable analyses, the 95% credible intervals overlapped, and
the differences were attenuated or disappeared in adjusted
analyses. We found little evidence that trials assessed as
being at high or unclear risk of bias for incomplete outcome
data produced systematically different estimates compared with
trials at low risk of bias for this domain, for all types of outcome
measures. Variability of treatment effects was higher in trials that
lacked blinding and had subjective outcomes, suggesting that for
such trials the direction and magnitude of bias is unpredictable.
Such variability in bias was observed both between trials
within a meta-analysis and across meta-analyses. There

 was little evidence of such variation in bias for other bias do-
mains or for objectively determined outcomes. Multivariable
analyses suggested that effects of individual risk-of-bias domain
judgements were less than additive, in that estimated effects of 2
bias domain judgements together were less than the com-
bined individual effects.
To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehen-
sive attempt to date to quantify the influence of 4 bias domains
on intervention effect estimates from randomized controlled
trials using routinely collected risk-of-bias assessments from
published Cochrane reviews. Our findings indicate that assess-
ments are associated with effect sizes, on average, for 3 of the 4
domains, providing some degree of validation of the risk-of-
bias tool. However, to interpret our findings as evidence of bias
due to the methods implemented in the trials, it is important to
consider the accuracy and reliability of these risk-of-bias assess-
ments. The assessments were made by a large number of Coch-
rane review authors with varying degrees of experience and
training, and we did not replicate assessments to determine how
appropriate they were. Although detailed guidance on how to
assess risk of bias in trials included in Cochrane reviews is
available in chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook (18), review
authors have reported that they find aspects of the assessment
difficult (22). Indeed, some studies have found that the assessor
agreement and interrater reliability of the risk-of-bias tool is
suboptimal (23, 24). Specifically, individual reviewers have
different criteria for judging a study to be at “low risk” of bias:
Some may be more confident about making a judgement with
less information, while others would opt for “unclear risk.”
Standard advice is that 2 assessors independently assess
risk of bias and resolve disagreements through discussion.
We presume that this advice was followed. As a safeguard
that recommended assessment methods were followed, at
least to some extent, we restricted eligibility to reviews that
had completed all 5 prescribed bias domains. It is possible
that individual review teams had their own criteria for rat-
ing a study “low-risk” for each of the domains, which may
have differed from those described in the handbook.

 In our main analyses, risk-of-bias judgements were dichoto-
mized so that “high” risk and “unclear” risk were considered
together. This allows for like-for-like comparisons with results
from most of the previous empirical studies, including our
previous study (17). Furthermore, there were few “high-
risk-of-bias” judgements, so analyses with the alternative
dichotomization of “high” versus “low” or “unclear” risk of
bias were not informative. For the domains of sequence genera-
tion and allocation concealment, a “high-risk-of-bias” judge-
ment was recorded in only 3% and 6% of trials, respectively
(Table 2). We demonstrated that Cochrane assessors frequently
reach a judgement of “unclear” risk of bias (Table 2). Inade-
quate reporting of key features of trial design is a likely explana-
tion for this high rate of uncertainty, particularly for methods of
sequence generation and allocation concealment. This obser-
vation is consistent with findings from a study by Turner et al.
(25) that allocation concealment was reported in sufficient detail
in 30% (722/2,396) of published randomized trials.
Our adjusted results for sequence generation and allocation
concealment were largely consistent with meta-analyses of all
previous meta-epidemiologic studies reported in a recent sys-
tematic review (26). Blinding and incomplete data in studies
included in that review were not assessed in the same way as in
our study and cannot be meaningfully compared with our re-
sults. Our results for average bias were slightly smaller than
those from our previous study, the Bias in Randomized and
Observational Studies (BRANDO) Study (17). This may reflect
dilution due to measurement error, arising because the risk-of-
bias assessments in the current study were conducted by a hetero-
geneous group of Cochrane reviewers. In contrast, assessments
used in the BRANDO Study were done by teams of trained
methodologists, and data were only combined in the BRANDO
analyses where the definitions for adequate versus inadequate
study method were consistent across studies. Our finding that
the lack of blinding in trials with subjective outcomes can lead
to biased effect estimates, but the direction and magnitude of
such bias are unpredictable, also confirms a finding from the
BRANDO Study (16, 17). The main difference between find-
ings from the current study and those from the BRANDO Study
is that here we do not see a clear difference in the magnitude of
bias according to type of outcome.
In summary, our results confirm that some aspects of the
conduct of randomized trials, particularly blinding, are associ-
ated with a modest exaggeration of treatment effects on aver-
age, but there is little evidence that the average bias differs
according to whether the outcome was subjectively or objec-
tively assessed. However, lack of blinding in trials with sub-
jective outcomes leads to increased heterogeneity and hence
unpredictable bias in effect estimates. As far as possible, clini-
cal and policy decisions should be cautious when they are
based on trials in which blinding was not reported or not feasi-
ble and outcome measures were subjectively assessed. Future
development of tools for assessing risk of bias in randomized
trials (27, 28) should reflect this observation and collect infor-
mation on the subjectivity of an outcome. Facilities for capture
of detailed routine assessments of risk of bias in randomized
trials should be made available for future meta-epidemiologic
research and could contribute to further improvement in methods
of risk-of-bias assessment.
