ABSTRACT
Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a highly specific feature of coronary atherosclerosis. On the basis of single-center and
multicenter clinical and population-based studies with short-term and long-term outcomes data (up to 15-year follow-
up), CAC scoring has emerged as a widely available, consistent, and reproducible means of assessing risk for major
cardiovascular outcomes, especially useful in asymptomatic people for planning primary prevention interventions such as
statins and aspirin. CAC testing in asymptomatic populations is cost effective across a broad range of baseline risk. This
review summarizes evidence concerning CAC, including its pathobiology, modalities for detection, predictive role, use in
prediction scoring algorithms, CAC progression, evidence that CAC changes the clinical approach to the patient and
patient behavior, novel applications of CAC, future directions in scoring CAC scans, and new CAC guidelines.

C
oronary artery calcium (CAC), a highly spe-
cific feature of coronary atherosclerosis (1),
is one of the most thoroughly studied and
widely available tests in cardiovascular medicine.
Following important single-center and clinical regis-
try studies, large long-term population-based obser-
vational studies were launched in the United States
(2,3), Germany (4), and the Netherlands (5) in the
late 1990s and early 2000s that have produced consis-
tent, reproducible, and convincing evidence of a
strong association between CAC (6) and major cardio-
vascular outcomes in asymptomatic people. Clinical
practice guidelines in the United States (7) and
Europe (8) consider CAC scoring to be a potentially
useful way of improving cardiovascular risk assess-
ment in asymptomatic people and serving as a guide
for initiating or deferring preventive therapies. Cost-
effectiveness analyses (9–14) have concluded that
CAC testing is cost effective in asymptomatic popula-
tions. Yet such application of CAC scoring in asymp-
tomatic
people
is
still
sometimes
regarded
as
experimental or unproven by many health insurance
companies in the United States (15).
The purpose of this review is to summarize the
evidence concerning CAC, with emphasis on asymp-
tomatic patients, including its pathobiology, modal-
ities for detection, predictive role, use in prediction
scoring algorithms, CAC progression, evidence that

 CAC changes the clinical approach to the patient and
patient behavior, novel applications of CAC, and
future directions in scoring CAC scans.
PATHOBIOLOGY OF
CORONARY ARTERY CALCIFICATION
Vascular calcification was accepted until recently as
an inevitable result of aging, and the development of
CAC was considered a passive process. The develop-
ment of CAC is now understood to be an active
pathogenic process that is not inevitable, and mech-
anisms that underlie vascular calcification have been
identified.
Ectopic
bone
production,
a
common
feature of atherosclerosis, is the basis for coronary
artery calcification (16). Developmental, inflamma-
tory, and metabolic factors all influence the process.
Master transcription factors, such as Msx2, Runx2,
Osterix, and Sox9, have been implicated in vascular
calcification, as have potent osteogenic differentia-
tion factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins 2
and 4. Matrix Gla protein is an inhibitor of bone
morphogenetic protein and is highly expressed in
calcified human arteries (17). Expression of both pro-
and antiosteogenic factors in CAC highlights the
extensive regulation of this process.
Inflammation, propagated by apolipoproteins and
oxidized phospholipids in the artery wall, is critical to
the development of both atherosclerosis and vascular
calcification
(18,19).
Several
mediators
associated
with oxidative stress are implicated in calcification,
and oxidative stress may be a key link between
inflammation and vascular calcification (20). Lipid
oxidation leads to pro-osteogenic mediators, such as
minimally
modified
low-density
lipoprotein
and
oxidized phospholipids (20).
Hyperlipidemia likely has both direct and indirect
effects on vascular calcification (21). Glucose can
directly promote vascular cell calcification (22), and
insulin can inhibit it (23). Adipose-derived factors
affect calcification, with leptin promoting (24) and
adiponectin inhibiting (25) vascular calcification.
MODALITIES FOR DETECTION OF CAC
Early studies of CAC used chest radiography, fluo-
roscopy, or digital subtraction fluoroscopy (26) and
began to show the potential value of CAC in predict-
ing the presence of obstructive coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD) (27), as well as future coronary events
(28–31).
Cardiac
gating,
first
introduced
with
electron-beam
computed
tomography
(EBCT),
allowed detection, localization, and quantification
with higher sensitivity (6). With the introduction of
EBCT, more precise quantification of CAC became
possible, allowing sufficient temporal reso-
lution
of
the
moving
heart.
However,
electron-beam computed tomographic (CT)
scanners were inadequate for general CT im-
aging and have been superseded by multi-
detector
computed
tomographic
scanners
that
are
comparable
with
EBCT
for
CAC
measurement
(32).
With
gantry
rotation,
MDCT produces hundreds of “snapshot” im-
ages from different angles, which are used to
reconstruct a complete image. Until recently,
only
cardiac-gated
studies
allowed
the
quantification of CAC. Because of the larger
numbers
of
detectors
and
faster
gantry
speeds in current multidetector CT scanners,
even nongated studies can provide either
semiquantitative (ordinal scores) or quanti-
tative CAC (Agatston scoring), with high cor-
relation
with
gated
CT
studies
and
cardiovascular disease outcomes (33,34). Modern CT
scans can be accomplished with 10 to 15 min of total
room time at about 1 mSv of radiation, without the
need for contrast agents.
EARLY STUDIES OF CAC,
CORONARY PLAQUE, AND CLINICAL CAD
Pathological studies demonstrated a strong correla-
tion between the presence of coronary calcium and
CAD. An early focus of CAC testing was to compare
results to invasive angiography, to establish the
sensitivity and specificity to detect obstructive CAD.
Sensitivity for obstructive CAD ranges from 88% to
100% (31,35–37). With high sensitivities for disease, a
negative test result has a very low probability of being
associated with obstructive CAD, with negative pre-
dictive values approaching 100% (38,39).
CAC quantification was found to be an excellent
anatomic measure of atherosclerotic plaque burden
(36,40). Sangiorgi et al. (40) showed a significant
association between coronary calcification area and
plaque volume, compared with no association be-
tween coronary calcification and lumen area. Rum-
berger et al. (36) conducted a histopathologic study
of coronary arteries from autopsy hearts that were
dissected, straightened, and scanned with EBCT in
3-mm
contiguous
increments.
CAC
and
coronary
artery plaque areas were highly correlated for the
hearts as a whole, for individual coronary arteries, and
for individual coronary artery segments (Figure 1).
Studies
of
intracoronary
ultrasound
have
also
confirmed a direct association of the CAC score with
the location and extent of atherosclerotic plaques
in vivo (41).

CAC Score and CVD Risk
435
 As early as 2004, single-center studies suggested a
strong risk-predictive value of CAC and incremental
value of CAC over traditional risk factors. The South
Bay Heart Watch Study demonstrated that CAC further
risk-stratified subjects deemed at intermediate risk by
the Framingham risk score (42). In 2005, the St. Francis
Heart Study showed a much higher risk, comparing
CAC >400 versus CAC ¼ 0 and an improvement in the
area under the curve from 0.69 to 0.79 with addition of
CAC to the Framingham risk score (43). Other studies
have shown that the incremental risk predictive value
of CAC extended to both younger and older subjects
(44), patients with diabetes (45), smokers (46,47), and
elderly patients (48,49).
FINDINGS FROM MAJOR
POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDIES
Findings from population-based cohort studies are
presented in Table 1.
MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) is a
prospective multicenter cohort sample of 6,814 men
and women 45 to 84 years of age, started in 2000 (2).
Approximately 38% of the recruited participants were
white, 28% African American, 22% Hispanic, and 12%
Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent. MESA used
electron-beam CT scanners at 3 centers and multi-
detector CT systems at 3 centers (50). CAC distribu-
tions were similar for EBCT and MDCT (51).
The prevalence of CAC was shown to differ by
ethnicity, higher in whites compared with the 3 other
ethnic groups (50). Differences across ethnicities
were not fully explained by risk factor differences,
suggesting that other factors must account for some
of the variability in CAC distributions. Most impor-
tant,
CAC
convincingly
predicted
cardiovascular
events beyond traditional risk factors, with similar
strength in all 4 ethnicities. MESA introduced the
presentation of estimated curves for the 50th, 75th,
and 90th percentiles of calcium across age, making it
possible to determine at a glance what an approxi-
mate percentile means for a particular patient (51).
The population-based HNR (Heinz Nixdorf Recall
[Risk Factors, Evaluation of Coronary Calcium and
Lifestyle]) study had similar goals to the MESA study
(4). Random samples of the general population were
drawn from residents’ registration offices from 3 West
German cities and included men and women from 45
to 74 years of age (52). The initial examination be-
tween 2000 and 2003 involved 4,487 people who
underwent EBCT, and results were blinded until the
second examination in 2006 to 2008. The second
examination included repeat EBCT (53), and a third
visit of the participants was organized after 10 years
(2011 to 2014), in addition to yearly written and tele-
phone contact and plans for ongoing future follow-up
(54). The mean age in the HNR study was 59 � 8 years,
and 53% of participants were women. Among 1,918
men, CAC prevalence was 82%, and in 2,148 women,
CAC prevalence was 55%. CAC $400 was found in
16.3% of men and 4.4% of women. In subjects with
known CAD, 100% of the men (n ¼ 218) and 82% of the
women (n ¼ 62) had CAC scores >0, and 77.5% and
41.9%,
respectively,
were
found
to
have
CAC
scores $400.
On the basis of similar designs and study protocols,
the results of the MESA and HNR study cohorts were
compared, including 2,220 and 3,126 participants,

 respectively (55). Despite differences in risk factor
profiles between the 2 studies, CAC scores were very
similar, as well as the age and sex distributions of CAC
expressed in percentiles (51). CAC was a similar pre-
dictor of events in both studies.
The Rotterdam Study is a prospective cohort study
among, initially, 7,983 persons living in the city of
Rotterdam in the Netherlands (78% of 10,215 invitees)
(56). All participants were at least 55 years of age.
Imaging of the heart, vasculature, eyes, skeleton, and
brain
was
completed,
and
biospecimens
were
archived. Of 3,370 eligible participants, 2,063 (61%,
mean age 71 years) underwent EBCT at first exami-
nation (57). Thus, the Rotterdam Study was an older
sample than in MESA or in the HNR study. The me-
dian CAC was 98 (25th and 75th percentiles: 10 and
430). Despite age and ethnicity differences between
cohorts, findings in the Rotterdam Study for CAC and
disease risk have been generally similar to those in
MESA and in the HNR study (58). A strong and graded
association was found between coronary calcification
and
myocardial
infarction,
and
the
association
remained present, even in older subjects (57,58).
Because of similarities among the 3 cohort studies,
meta-analyses including all 3 studies have examined
subcohorts of interest. A meta-analysis in low-risk
women (59) found that CAC >0 was present in
approximately one-third and was associated with an
increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-
ease (ASCVD) and modest improvement in prognostic
accuracy compared with traditional risk factors. A
meta-analysis
was
conducted
in
elderly
subjects
(mean age 70 years) (58) from among 4,778 partici-
pants from 3 U.S. cohorts, including MESA, Framing-
ham, and the Cardiovascular Health Study. Over 11
years of follow-up, 405 coronary heart disease (CHD)
and 228 stroke events occurred. CAC score (vs. age)
had a greater association with incident CHD and
modestly improved prediction of incident stroke.
Findings were similar in the Rotterdam and HNR
cohorts.
The FHS (Framingham Heart Study) added a CAC
measurement by MDCT to the examinations of the
Framingham Offspring and Third Generation cohorts
in 2005. The FHS is limited to white men and women,
but distributions of CAC >0 and CAC >100 were very
similar to those previously reported from MESA. A
novel analysis from the CAC data evaluated whether
information on the distribution of CAC and coronary
dominance, as detected by MDCT, was incremental to
the traditional Agatston score in predicting incident
CHD. During a median follow-up of 7 years, the
number of coronary arteries with CAC and the pres-
ence of CAC in the proximal dominant coronary artery
were significantly associated with major CHD events
after multivariate adjustment for Framingham risk
score and categories of Agatston score. This analysis
suggested that additional information from MDCT can
augment the traditional Agatston score for risk pre-
diction (60).
The CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in
Young Adults) study measured CAC during follow-up
and is the first prospective cohort to include data on
CAC among subjects from 32 to 46 years of age.

 CARDIA showed that CAC >0 is not uncommon in this
age group, particularly when a risk factor is present
(61,62). Over an approximately 10-year follow-up
period, CAC strongly predicted risk beyond tradi-
tional risk factors in these young subjects (63).
The Jackson Heart Study measured CAC during
follow-up. Among African Americans, CAC predicted
risk beyond the traditional risk factors and has been
shown to better identify persons most likely to
benefit from preventive therapies (64,65).
CAC
was
measured
during
follow-up
of
the
Women’s Health Initiative, with CAC showing incre-
mental predictive value over risk factors in post-
menopausal women (66). CAC is currently being
measured in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Com-
munities)
study,
which
is
expected
to
provide
important insight into its risk predictive capability in
adults >75 years of age.
USING CAC IN RISK SCORES FOR
CLINICAL DECISION MAKING
For more than 40 years, clinical decisions in preven-
tive cardiology have been based on risk assessment
equations (67). Clinical practice guidelines, including
those from the United States (7), Europe (8,68), and
Canada (69), have universally recommended risk
factor equations that use office-based measurements
of blood lipids, blood pressure, age, smoking history,
and presence or absence of diabetes as mainstays of
clinical risk assessment. Although it is widely recog-
nized that CAC scoring can improve upon these clin-
ical
risk
assessments,
guidelines
have
not
recommended using risk scores that require CAC
testing (Table 2). To date, there is only 1 risk score that
has incorporated CAC into the model and validated
the score in external population samples (70). After 10
years of follow-up, McClelland et al. (70) used MESA
data to derive and validate a risk score to estimate 10-
year CHD risk using CAC plus traditional risk factors.
External validation was conducted in the HNR study
and the DHS (Dallas Heart Study). Inclusion of CAC
results in the MESA risk score offered significant im-
provements in risk prediction. External validation in
HNR demonstrated very good discrimination and
calibration. The MESA risk score is available online
(71) and via smartphone application and can be used
when communicating risk to patients and when
determining risk-based treatment strategies.
CAC scoring was also tested in a cardiovascular
event prediction model created by machine learning
techniques in the MESA dataset (72). The CAC score
was the most important predictor of CHD and all
ASCVD combined outcomes, improving on more than
700 other baseline variables.
COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF CAC IN
PREVENTIVE CARDIOLOGY
Cost-effectiveness of CAC testing in the primary pre-
vention context has been evaluated by several inde-
pendent groups using generally similar assumptions
and simulations (9–14). The datasets for 6 separate
cost-effectiveness studies have been based on results
from the Rotterdam Study, MESA, and the FHS. Crit-
ical factors that drive conclusions in all of the cost-
effectiveness studies are the cost of statins and the
rating of discomfort or side effects from statins, as
well as the general desire to avoid lifelong preventive
therapy (“disutility”). With relatively small differ-
ences in these inputs into the models, conclusions
have varied from “treat all” with statins above a fairly
low risk threshold (10,12) without performing CAC to
“perform CAC in all” in selected risk categories and
treat with statins if CAC >0 (11,14). In a recent anal-
ysis by Hong et al. (14), outcomes were similar be-
tween using CT scans for CAC measurement or the
2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American
Heart Association (AHA) guidelines (7,73) to guide
long-term

However,
fewer
patients would be treated using a CAC screening
strategy. Hong et al. therefore proposed that cost-
effectiveness analyses should not be the only crite-
rion
for
clinical
decision
making,
but
a
shared
decision-making model is most important for clini-
cians, patients, and policymakers. Their analysis and
previous cost-effectiveness analyses are consistent
with
the
concept
that
CAC
testing
represents
a
reasonable option to risk-stratify as well as facilitate
shared
decision
making
without
any
significant
downstream adverse outcomes, loss of quality of life,
and/or increased costs (14).
CAC PROGRESSION
Because interscan variability of CAC score results is
low (w10%), quantitative estimates of CAC progres-
sion are possible. MESA reported results of CAC pro-
gression in 5,756 participants with an average of 2.4
years between 2 CT scans (74). CAC scores increased
by about 20% to 25% per year, and about 20% of
subjects with CAC ¼ 0 progressed to CAC >0 within 4
to 5 years. Because CAC progression is most strongly
predicted by baseline CAC, the distribution of CAC is
always heavily right skewed, underscoring the expo-
nential nature of CAC change over time, which was
confirmed by the HNR study (75).
In the HNR study, with CT scans spaced 5 years
apart, CAC incidence was identified in a cohort of
men and women who had CAC ¼ 0 at the first exam-
ination. The probability of incident CAC at 5 years
among those with no CAC initially steadily increased
with age, from 23% in men 45 to 49 years of age to
67% in the 70 to 74 years of age category. In women,
new onset of CAC was seen in 15% (age 45 to 49 years)
and 43% (age 70 to 74 years), respectively. Findings
were
similar
after
adjusting
for
traditional
risk
factors (76).
CAC progression has been associated with higher
risk for myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality
(77–79). Various studies have used differing algo-
rithms to quantify the degree of CAC progression,
which may have influenced the different outcomes
among studies (80,81). Lehmann et al. (82), in the
HNR study, reported a method to differentiate rapid
and
slow
CAC
progression
compared
with
an
expected and calculated norm. On the basis of addi-
tional HNR data, the prediction of coronary and car-
diovascular events was compared for 10 published
algorithms (54). Analysis of CAC progression did not
add
any
benefit
to
risk
prediction
models
that
included the most recent CT scan and the most recent
follow-up risk factors. The best coronary disease
prognosis was found for participants with “double
zero,” meaning CAC ¼ 0 both at baseline and at the CT
scan 5 years later. This pair was associated with a
10-year risk of only 1.4%, followed by incident CAC
after 5 years with a 10-year risk estimate of 1.8%.
Therefore, a repeat scan after 5 years seems to be of
additional value, except for those who already have a
double-zero CAC scan or have already been classified
at high risk because of CAC $400 (54).
CAC AND PREVENTIVE THERAPIES
Although there is now ample evidence that CAC im-
proves statistical risk reclassification (83,84), that is,
modifying risk estimates in subjects free of events
into lower risk categories and those with events into
higher risk categories (net reclassification index),
there is also evidence that CAC might directly guide
risk-based selection of appropriate preventive thera-
pies (85). MESA investigators studied 950 subjects
who met inclusion criteria for the JUPITER (Justifi-
cation for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Inter-
vention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) clinical trial
(86). Of these “eligible” subjects, 47% had CAC ¼ 0,
whereas 25% had CAC >100. Using observed absolute
event rates from MESA, coupled with the relative risk
reduction observed with rosuvastatin in the JUPITER
trial, the 5-year number needed to treat to prevent 1
cardiovascular event varied from 124 for subjects with
CAC ¼ 0 to just 19 for those with CAC >100. Similar
analyses
demonstrating
that
CAC
might
identify
those expected to derive both the most and the least
net benefit from statin therapy have been performed
for patients meeting criteria for any one of the statin
clinical trials (87), among elderly patients (88), or for
all patients with dyslipidemia (89).
Nasir et al. (90) conducted an analysis of the
potential impact of CAC on statin allocation in the
context of the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment
guidelines.
In
MESA
participants
with
a
10-year
ASCVD risk of between 5% and 7.5% using the
pooled cohort equation (7,90), a finding of CAC ¼ 0
was associated with observed ASCVD event rates
less
than
the
guideline-recommended
treatment
threshold
of
7.5%
(actual
event
rate
w1.5%),
whereas any CAC >0 was associated with event
rates higher than the accepted threshold for statin
benefit.
Likewise,
in
participants
with
10-year
ASCVD risk between 7.5% and 20%, CAC ¼ 0 was
associated with event rates below the guideline-
based threshold of statin benefit (w4.5%), whereas
any CAC >0 was associated with events consistent

 with net benefit from statin therapy (w10.5%). In
this analysis, CAC had no role in middle-aged adults
with a 10-year ASCVD risk >20%. This study directly
informed the recommendation by the Society of
Cardiovascular
Computed
Tomography
(SCCT)
to
consider CAC testing, within the context of shared
decision making, in intermediate-risk patients be-
tween 40 and 75 years of age with a 10-year ASCVD
risk between 5% and 20% (91). Mahabadi et al. (92)
conducted
a
similar
analysis
relating
to
the
indication for statin therapy using European Society
of Cardiology and ACC/AHA guidelines. The CAC
score consistently stratified risk for ASCVD events
across
both
statin-recommended
and
non-statin-
recommended groups (Figure 2). Thus, CAC scoring
may help match intensified risk factor modification
to atherosclerotic plaque burden as well as actual
risk, while avoiding statin therapy in patients with
low
CAC
scores
and
low
10-year
event
rates
(sometimes called derisking) (92,93).

Miedema
et

(94)
studied
the

benefit
of
aspirin in 4,229 subjects free of diabetes in MESA.
This analysis found that there would be a predicted

with

therapy
when

(number

bleeds

apy, regardless of risk factors, in those with CAC

(Figure
3).
These
data
also
helped
inform
recent
SCCT
guidelines
recommending
consider-
ation of aspirin therapy for all patients with CAC
>100 (91).
With more formal incorporation of absolute risk
assessment in future cholesterol and blood pressure
guidelines, CAC may take on a greater role in the se-
lection of cholesterol and blood pressure therapeutic
targets. For example, subjects with CAC >100 have
event rates closer to stable secondary prevention (89)
and
could
benefit
from
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol goals of <70 mg/dl (95). McEvoy et al. (96)
demonstrated that the 10-year number needed to
treat of pursuing aggressive blood pressure targets
varies considerably by baseline CAC status (99 for
CAC ¼ 0 vs. 24 for CAC >100).
CAC AND CLINICIAN AND
PATIENT BEHAVIOR
Risk reclassification by any test, including CAC, will
result in clinical benefit only if there is an impact
on patient or physician behavior. The EISNER (Early
Identification
of
Subclinical
Atherosclerosis
by
Noninvasive Imaging Research) study randomized
2,137 volunteers to CAC scanning versus no CAC
scanning
and
followed
subjects
for
the
4-year
change in risk factors and 10-year estimated risk
score (97). In the primary analysis, those random-
ized to CAC scanning experienced a net favorable
change in blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and waist circumference, along with a
lower Framingham risk score at the 4-year follow-
up. Medical costs in the CAC scanning group were
similar to those in the no-scanning group, with
decreased costs in those with CAC ¼ 0 balanced by
increased spending in those with CAC $400 (i.e.,
closer association between risk and medical expen-
diture in the CAC scanning arm of the trial) (98).
Observational studies suggested an impact of high
CAC score on initiation and continuation of preven-
tive medications (99), and more definitive evidence
has been provided by a recent meta-analysis. In a
pooled analysis of 6 studies including 11,256 partici-
pants, with a mean follow-up time ranging from 1.6 to
6 years, Gupta et al. (100) demonstrated significantly
higher
odds
of
aspirin
initiation,
lipid-lowering
medication initiation and continuation, antihyper-
tensive medication initiation, increased exercise, and
dietary change in subjects with CAC >0 compared
with those with CAC ¼ 0. Findings persisted after
adjustment for demographic factors as well as car-
diovascular risk factors.
CAC USING NONGATED CHEST CT IMAGING
Several studies have confirmed a role for identifying
CAC on nongated chest CT imaging (34,101). Although
a formal quantitative CAC score cannot be obtained
from a nongated study, experienced readers can
provide a qualitative CAC assessment (none, mild,
moderate, or severe) that correlates closely with
traditional CAC score groups (0, 1 to 100, 101 to 400,
and >400) (102,103). The role of CAC in nongated
chest CT imaging takes on importance with the
increasing acceptance of lung cancer screening in
those between 55 and 80 years of age who have a 30-
pack-year smoking history and who have smoked
within the past 15 years. Leigh et al. (104) demon-
strated that CAC predicted ASCVD risk in all smokers

The estimated risk and benefit of aspirin in primary prevention by coronary artery calcium
(CAC) score in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) participants are shown.
Coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was calculated using the Framingham risk score. The
red line represents the estimated 5-year number needed to harm on the basis of a
0.23% increase in major bleeding over 5 years. The 5-year number needed to treat
estimations are based on an 18% relative reduction in CHD events. In patients with
CAC ¼ 0, aspirin was not estimated to be beneficial, regardless of estimated CHD risk.
Conversely, when CAC >100, aspirin was estimated to provide net benefit, regardless of
CHD risk estimate. Reprinted with permission from Miedema et al. (94).

 and in those eligible for lung cancer screening,
although the improvement over the risk factor score
alone was modest. Recent guidelines from the SCCT/
Society of Thoracic Radiology provide a Class I indi-
cation for evaluation and reporting of at least quali-
tative
CAC
scoring
on
all
noncontrast
chest
CT
examinations (91).
CAC IN SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION CT AND
POSITION EMISSION TOMOGRAPHIC
PERFUSION IMAGING
A limitation of routine stress testing is the reliance on
functional data (i.e., evidence of ischemia), with an
inability to quantify the anatomic atherosclerosis
burden. However, CAC scoring can be added to
single-photon emission computed tomography and
positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion
imaging using hybrid scanners (105). CAC scores ob-
tained from the attenuation scans obtained at the
time of perfusion imaging are highly predictive of
risk, including in patients for whom there is no evi-
dence of myocardial ischemia (106,107). CAC testing
at the time of stress testing can improve assessment
of pre-test risk (38), increase interpreter certainty
(108), and lead to more risk-based preventive medical
decision making compared with stress testing alone
(109).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
IMPROVING THE CAC SCORE
When a formal approach to CAC scoring was intro-
duced in 1990 (6), little was known about the rela-
tionship among calcification, total atherosclerotic
plaque, and ASCVD risk. However, since then, the
understanding of why CAC scoring predicts risk has
matured, with increasing attention paid to potential
ways to improve the Agatston score. The Agatston
score is limited in its assumption that scores should
be upweighted with higher calcium density, its failure
to capture information about the regional distribution
of calcified plaque, and its fixed scanning parameters
(120 kV, 3-mm slice thickness) (110). Following evi-
dence demonstrating that low attenuation of a plaque
is a high-risk feature, studies have suggested that the
Agatston score predicts risk better if it is inversely
weighted
for
calcium
density
(111).
In
addition,
studies have shown that the regional distribution of
CAC (in particular the total number of coronary ar-
teries with CAC) adds prognostic information to the
Agatston score, with higher risk in those with more
diffuse plaque distributions (112,113).
CAC
scoring
can
be
accomplished
with
little
ionizing radiation with simple modifications to the
scanning protocol. For example, radiation could be
reduced to well below 1 mSv of radiation with use of a
lower energy photon, although CAC scores must then
be recalibrated (114). In addition, emerging micro-
calcification may be detected using thinner slices,
allowing detection of higher risk cases among those
with CAC ¼ 0 (115).
The need for a new CAC score is a matter of current
debate
(116).
A
new
CAC
score
may
potentially
incorporate extracoronary calcification, as evidence
mounts that aortic valve calcification, aortic calcifi-
cation, and mitral annular calcification add risk pre-
dictive value, particularly from stroke and other
cardiovascular outcomes (117).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: CAC AND
NONCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK
CAC provides a summary measure of atherosclerotic
disease, reflecting the cumulative lifetime effect of
both measurable (i.e., risk factors) and unmeasurable
(i.e., all genetic and environmental factors) risk de-
terminants directly on vulnerable tissue (118). Given
its role as a “risk integrator,” there is increasing in-
terest
in
the
role
of
CAC
in
predicting
non–
cardiovascular
disease
outcomes.
CAC
has
been
shown to predict incident cancer, chronic kidney dis-
ease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hip
fracture independent of age, sex, and risk factors (119).
CAC has also been shown to be an independent pre-
dictor of dementia (120). Ongoing work seeks to clarify
the role of CAC in predicting risk for ASCVD versus
cancer across the life span (121). CAC also appears
valuable in identifying long-term “healthy agers”:
those surviving into old age with CAC ¼ 0 (122).
CAC AND GUIDELINES
In 2010, the ACC/AHA guidelines on risk prediction in
asymptomatic patients assigned CAC a Class IIA
recommendation for intermediate-risk patients and a
Class IIB recommendation in low- to intermediate-
risk patients and advised against CAC testing in very
low-risk patients, as defined by the Framingham risk
score.
In
2013,
the
ACC/AHA
guidelines
on
risk
assessment gave CAC a Class IIb recommendation for
patients in whom risk or the decision to treat with
statins is unclear. Recent 2017 guidelines from the
SCCT recommended consideration of CAC testing
(equivalent of a Class II recommendation), in the
context of shared decision making, for subjects with a

 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to 20% or in those with <5%
10-year risk but with another strong indication, such
as a family history of premature CAD (91). Other
guidelines (8,123) have provided recommendations
similar to the 2013 ACC/AHA risk assessment guide-
line; see Table 2 for a summary of recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS
Coronary artery calcification has emerged as the most
predictive
single
cardiovascular
risk
marker
in
asymptomatic persons, capable of adding predictive
information beyond the traditional cardiovascular risk
factors. CAC scoring appears to be useful for making
decisions about preventive statin and/or aspirin use. In
most studies, CAC testing has been shown to be cost
effective compared with alternative approaches when
factoring in patient preferences about taking preven-
tive medications. In the Central Illustration, we suggest
a clinical approach, modified from the ACC/AHA lipid
treatment guideline (73) and from Nasir et al. (90,124),
incorporating a broader use of CAC testing in selected
individuals.
