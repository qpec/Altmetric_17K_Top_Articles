Summary
Background Presbyopia, age-related decline in near vision, is the most common cause of vision impairment globally, 
but no trials have assessed its workplace effects. We aimed to study the effect of near glasses on the productivity of tea 
workers with presbyopia.
Methods This randomised trial was done in tea pickers aged 40 years or older in Assam, India, with unaided 
near visual acuity (NVA) lower than 6/12 in both eyes, correctable to 6/7·5 with near glasses; unaided distance 
vision 6/7·5 or greater; and no eye disease. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive free glasses 
optimising NVA at working distance (cost including delivery US$10·20 per person), either immediately (intervention 
group) or at closeout (control group). Participants were stratified by age, sex, and productivity. The primary outcome 
(investigator-masked) was the difference between groups in the change in mean daily weight of tea picked 
(productivity), between the 4-week baseline period (June, 2017) and the 11-week evaluation period (July 24, 2017, to 
Oct 7, 2017). Workers’ income was tied to their productivity. Compliance with study glasses was assessed at 
seven unannounced visits. Results were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03228199.
Findings Between July 3, 2017, and July 15, 2017, 1297 (48·1%) of 2699 permanent workers met the age criteria and 
consented for eye examinations. 751 (57·9%) fulfilled vision criteria and were randomly assigned to the intervention 
(n=376) or control (n=375) groups. Groups did not differ substantially in baseline characteristics. No participants 
owned glasses at baseline, 707 (94·1%) received the allocated intervention, and all were followed up and analysed. 
Between the baseline and evaluation periods, mean productivity in the intervention group increased from 25·0 kg per 
day to 34·8 kg per day (an increase of 9·84 kg per day), a significantly higher increase than in the control group 
(from 26·0 kg per day to 30·6 kg per day; an increase of 4·59 kg per day), corresponding to a between-group difference 
of 5·25 kg per day (95% CI 4·50–5·99; 21·7% relative productivity increase; effect size 1·01 [95% CI 0·86–1·16]; 
p<0·0001). Intervention-group compliance with study glasses reached 84·5% by closeout. Regression model 
predictors of greater productivity increase included intervention group membership (5·25 kg per day [95% CI 
4·60–5·91], p<0·0001) and, among intervention participants, older age (p=0·039) and better compliance with the 
intervention (p<0·0001).
Interpretation A substantial productivity increase was achieved in this rural cohort by providing glasses to correct 
presbyopia, with little cost and high intervention uptake.

Introduction
Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman has said: “Productivity 
isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost 
everything. A country’s ability to improve its standard of 
living over time depends almost entirely on… [raising] 
output per worker.”1 The Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), central to the UN global development 
agenda, call for an end to poverty (SDG 1) and the 
promotion of health for all (SDG 3).2 A basic tenet of 
global health policy is that good health and productive 
work are causally linked,3 and yet the effects on labour 
productivity of only a few health interventions have 
been evaluated in randomised trials in low-income and 
middle-income countries.4–9 Most such trials involve 
dietary supplementation to improve nutritional status,4,6–9 
and have generally shown uncertain or non-significant 
effect sizes.4,6–9 Supplementation requires sustainable 
distribution pathways and long-term adherence, both of 
which are challenging in low-resource areas.
Low-cost, sustainable, and effective health inter-
ventions are needed to increase work productivity 
and reduce poverty in low-income and middle-income

countries. With the global population ageing rapidly, 
and labour participation rates in low-income and 
middle-income countries declining in individuals older 
than 45 years,10 health strategies that support productive 
employment (SDG 8) among older workers are of 
particular interest. Gender equality (SDG 5) is also 
highly relevant to poverty alleviation, as increasing 
workforce participation and productivity among women 
results in faster economic growth.11
Presbyopia is the essentially universal decline in 
unaided near vision associated with ageing. Functionally 
apparent around the age of 40 years, and essentially 
complete by age 55 years,12 presbyopia is prevalent during 
the working years.13 The number of affected individuals 
globally exceeds 1 billion, making presbyopia the world’s 
most common cause of vision impairment.14 Although 
presbyopia is safely, effectively, and inexpensively treated 
with glasses, ownership rates in low-income and middle-
income countries are as low as 10%.15,16 Presbyopia causes 
an estimated US$25 billion in global productivity loss17 
and is associated with substantial impairment in 
activities of daily living.18 However, to the best of our 
knowledge there are no published trials examining 
whether correcting presbyopia with glasses improves 
work productivity.
We aimed to do a randomised, investigator-masked 
trial to ascertain whether providing free glasses to tea 
workers with presbyopia in India could improve work 
productivity. Our hypothesis was that inclusion in the 
intervention group would lead to significantly greater 
increases in productivity than in the control group, 
measured as the group difference in the change in 
mean daily weight of tea picked before and after the 
intervention.
Methods
Study design and participants
The PROSPER (PROductivity Study of Presbyopia 
Elimination 
in 
Rural-dwellers) 
study 
was 
an 
investigator-masked, randomised trial carried out in 
Assam, India. The protocol was approved by ethics 
committees at Lions National Association of the Blind 
(NAB) Eye Hospital (Miraj, India) and Queen’s 
University Belfast (Belfast, UK; approval for data 
analysis). The tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki 
were followed throughout. The study protocol is 
available online.
Unlike the rest of the year, the amount of tea picked 
during the high season in Assam (June to October) is 
limited by the worker, rather than by the rate of plant 
growth. Income is therefore tied to productivity as an 
incentive. All permanent workers aged 40 years or older 
as of Dec 31, 2017, at three tea estates in Assam (Kellyden, 
Nonoi, and Sagmootea) owned by Amalgamated 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We reviewed the impact of presbyopia in low-income and 
middle-income countries by searching MEDLINE, Embase, and 
WHO Library databases from Nov 19, 2017, to Nov 26, 2017, 
for articles published in any language appearing after 
Jan 1, 1975, using the following combinations of terms 
together with a list of low-income and middle-income 
countries: “near vision” AND “impairment”; “prevalence” AND 
“presbyopia”; “presbyopia” OR “near vision” AND “correction”; 
“presbyopia” AND “correction” AND “productivity”; and 
“presbyopia” AND “correction” AND “quality of life” AND 
“activity”. Population studies in rural China and Tanzania 
provided low-quality evidence of significantly increased 
difficulty with activities of daily living among individuals with 
presbyopia. A small study (n=187) in Zanzibar addressing the 
impact of presbyopia correction with glasses found 
moderate-quality evidence of large effects on work-related 
activities of daily living. We found no randomised trials. For 
our review of health interventions to improve work 
productivity in low-income and middle-income countries we 
searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Econlit databases on 
Nov 16, 2017, for studies published in any language since 
inception, using 53 terms (appendix). We found six trials, only 
one published after 2005, of which five concerned nutritional 
interventions and one mosquito nets. Only two had 
statistically significant effect sizes, both less than 15%. 
Together, these studies provided weak-to-moderate-quality 
evidence for a modest effect of iron, and possibly mosquito 
netting, on improving work productivity.
Added value of this study
Our investigator-masked, randomised trial on the effect of 
providing glasses to correct presbyopia among 751 tea workers 
aged 40 years or older in India found a significantly higher 
increase in mean productivity in the intervention group than in 
the control group. The intervention cost was low (US$10·20 per 
person), acceptance was high (>80% by closeout), presbyopia 
was common (>50%) among workers aged 40 years or older, 
and biological plausibility was increased by an observed greater 
effect of the intervention among older participants with this 
age-related condition.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study adds to the evidence that correction of even modest 
presbyopia, which is common at age 40 years or older, can 
significantly improve work productivity at low cost in a 
visually demanding labour setting. This intervention can be 
sustained by workers themselves; 95% of workers in this study 
said they would pay for glasses. Our results are consistent with 
evidence from other studies (none of which were trials) 
suggesting that correction of presbyopia can improve 
performance of various economically important tasks.

Plantation Private Ltd (APPL), and who had worked for 
APPL for at least 1 year and for 10 or more days in the 
previous month, were invited to undergo a free eye 
examination. Study personnel obtained oral informed 
consent from workers undergoing examinations. The 
study inclusion criterion based on this examination 
was the presence of presbyopia in both eyes, defined 
as habitual near visual acuity (NVA) of 6/12 or lower at 
40 cm, correctable with spherical (non-astigmatic) near 
glasses to 6/7·5 or greater, as such glasses are cheap 
and quick to make. Exclusion criteria were: ownership 
of near glasses capable of improving NVA to 6/12 or 
greater, unaided distance vision lower than 6/7·5, 
visually significant eye disease, and low likelihood of 
completing follow-up. The latter was assessed by asking 
participants whether there was any reason why they 
might not be able to complete the study (eg, plans to 
move out of the region).
Randomisation and masking
Consenting participants eligible for the trial were 
divided into eight strata according to age (<50 years vs 
≥50 years), sex, and work productivity during June, 2016 
(<median vs ≥median). Participants in each stratum 
were randomly assigned (1:1) with a block size of six to 
the intervention or control groups. The intervention 
group immediately received free, spherical presbyopic 
glasses providing the best NVA in each eye at the 
participant’s usual working distance. The control group 
received similar glasses after the 11-week evaluation 
period.
The randomisation sequence was generated by the 
study statistician at the Clinical Trials Unit of the 
Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (Guangzhou, China) by 
use of an online random number generator (Random-
ization.com), and concealed until a worker was identified 
as being eligible and agreed to participate. The field 
team consisted of four experienced optometrists, 
three nurses, two data assistants, and a screening 
coordinator, all employed by VisionSpring, an eye health 
non-governmental organisation. This team had a list 
provided by APPL of potential participants and their 
current age and productivity in June, 2016. The team 
carried out eye examinations and distributed glasses 
to eligible participants in the intervention group from 
July 3, 2017, to July 15, 2017
. Study personnel accessed 
the random assignment for each participant according 
to the correct age-sex-productivity stratum only at the 
time of enrolment.
Study personnel carrying out the eye examination 
and facilitating randomisation and distribution of 
glasses had no further contact with participants until 
glasses were distributed to the control group at trial 
closeout. Masking of study participants to their group 
assignment was impractical, but staff measuring the 
weight of tea picked were masked to workers’ group 
assignments.
Procedures
Consenting workers meeting age and work criteria 
underwent measurement of distance visual acuity in 
each eye separately with a log of the Minimum Angle 
of Resolution (logMAR) chart in a well-lit area. Study 
optometrists measured unaided NVA (without near 
glasses) in each eye separately with a tumbling E Early 
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart19 
at a distance of 40 cm.
Workers meeting criteria for near and distance vision 
underwent assessment of refractive power by an 
optometrist. They were directed to stand in front of a tea 
bush and adopt their usual stance for picking tea. The 
distance from each eye to the top of the bush was 
measured, and lenses enabling the participant to identify 
two to three leaves and a bud appropriate for picking 
were prescribed. Glasses were provided to the inter-
vention group immediately after the eye examination, 
with directions to begin wearing them on July 24, 2017, 
when the trial began. 
Data were collected on potential determinants of 
productivity and compliance with glasses, including age, 
sex, marital status, baseline ownership of glasses, years 
working as a tea picker, and work attitudes. Participants’ 
height was also measured as a potential determinant of 
productivity.
Workers with unaided distance visual acuity lower 
than 6/18 (ineligible for the study) underwent refraction 
tests and received free distance glasses if required. 
Those whose distance visual acuity did not improve 
with glasses underwent a detailed ocular examination 
with dilation of the pupil and examination of the ocular 
fundus. Workers with cataract were referred for free 
surgery and those with other conditions were referred 
to a local eye hospital (ERC Eye Care, Jorhat, Assam, 
India), with medical expenses assumed by APPL.
Outcomes
The main study outcome was the difference between 
randomised groups in the change in mean daily weight 
of tea picked between the baseline period (retrospective 
data from June, 2017) and the evaluation period. 
Secondary outcomes were visual quality of life, assessed 
once (Aug 2–8, 2017) with the National Eye Institute 
Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25)20 during 
the evaluation period, and observed wear of glasses 
in the intervention group during seven regular, un-
announced visits. Daily work attendance during the 
evaluation period was obtained from APPL records. 
Subjective usefulness of study glasses, likelihood of 
recommending them to other workers, and amount 
willing to pay for them if lost or broken were assessed 
for the intervention group, but these assessments were 
not prespecified.
Daily weight of tea picked by participants in both 
groups was assessed by masked APPL employees 
as follows during an 11-week evaluation period from

. Intervention-group 
participants removed their glasses before proceeding to 
the weighing station. One employee received the sack 
of tea and suspended it on an electrical scale (Easyweigh, 
Applied Data Logix, Chennai, India), while a second, 
also masked to workers’ group assignments, swiped the 
participant’s work identification card. The scale 
automatically measured and recorded the weight in the 
APPL database.
Statistical analysis
With a two-sided significance level of p=0·05 and power 
of 80% to detect a 10% greater increase in the 
intervention group than in the control group from a 
baseline mean of 25·0 kg per day (SD 5·0) of tea picked 
(based on APPL records), and allowing for 20% loss 
to follow-up, we calculated that a sample size of 
160 individuals (80 per group) would be required. To do 
adequately powered age-stratified analyses, we sought 
to recruit 700 participants in total.
The difference in productivity gains between study 
groups was assessed by intention to treat with the 
two-sample t test. Linear regression analyses were done 
on potential determinants of primary and secondary 
outcomes. The study group and all significant variables 
with p values less than 0·20 in simple regression 
analyses were included in multiple regression models. 
Histograms, normal quantile plots (QQ Plot), and the 
Jarque-Bera normality test were used to test the 
normality assumption in regression models. For the 
VFQ-25, a composite score (25 items) and near activities 
subscore (two items) were created on 0–100 scales. The 
percentage increase in productivity for each group, 
measured as the change in mean daily weight of tea 
picked between the baseline and evaluation period, 
divided by the group’s baseline mean, was calculated. 
For multiple imputation of missing data in assessing 
primary and secondary outcomes, we created 20 copies 
of the data, in which missing values were imputed by 
chained equations, and the datasets were averaged. 
Statistical analyses were done in Stata, version 14.2.
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT03228199.

Results
Among 2699 permanent tea pickers at the three estates, 
1398 (51·8%) met the age and work criteria and were 
eligible for the screening eye examination (figure 1). 
For details of stratification by age, sex, and productivity, 
see the appendix. Among these, 1297 (92·8%) 
completed the examination. 63 (4·51%) were absent 
and 38 (2·72%) declined. Based on the examination, 
751 (57·9%) workers were eligible for the trial and 
underwent stratification and randomisation, with 376 
(50·1%) participants allocated to the intervention group 
and 375 (49·9%) to the control group. Among 
intervention participants, 361 (96·0%) received their 
allocated treatment, as did 346 (92·3%) of control 
participants. All participants completed follow-up and 
were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.
Participants in both groups were primarily women, 
with a mean age of 47 years (table 1). No participants 
had glasses at baseline, and most had modest 
presbyopia, with less than 20% in both groups having 
NVA less than 6/18. Nearly all participants in both 
groups had normal NVA (6/6 at 40 cm) with study 
glasses, and all agreed that “It is important to maximise 
my income by picking as much tea as possible.”

Baseline mean daily weight of tea picked (June, 2017) 
differed between control (26·0 kg per day) and 
intervention participants (25·0 kg per day; p=0·00055), 
as stratification on the most recently available data 
(June, 2016) did not fully balance the groups.
The daily weight of tea picked in the intervention 
group increased from 25·0 kg per day to 34·8 kg per 
day between the baseline and the evaluation periods. 
This increase of 9·84 kg per day (95% CI 9·27–10·4) 
was greater than that for the control group (from 26·0 kg 
per day to 30·6 kg per day, an increase of 4·59 kg per 
day [95% CI 4·10–5·07]; p<0·0001). The between-group 
difference (5·25 kg per day [95% CI 4·50–5·99]; 
p<0·0001) was equivalent to a 21·7% relative produc-
tivity increase, with an effect size (Cohen’s d) of 
1·01 (95% CI 0·86–1·16; table 2). In multiple regression 
models, variables significantly associated with greater 
productivity increase included intervention group 
membership, female sex, and work attendance during 
the evaluation period (table 3). Years working as a tea 
picker (p=0·042) and intervention-group compliance 
with glasses (p<0·0001) were significantly associated 
with greater productivity increases in univariate 
analyses, but were excluded from multivariate models 
because of collinearity with age and group assignment.
In multivariate models, the association between age 
and productivity increase was different between inter-
vention and control groups: increasing age was associated 
with greater productivity increases (0·112 kg per day 
per year of age, p=0·039) in the intervention group, but 
negatively associated with productivity (–0·158 kg per 
day per year of age; p=0·00022) within the control 
group (table 3). Thus, the between-group difference 
in the change in productivity rose with increasing 
age (figure 2): 40–44 years (3·89 kg per day [95% CI 
2·82–4·96], 15·8% of baseline); 45–49 years (4·79 kg per 
day [3·47–6·12], 18·9% of baseline), and 50 years or older 
(7·29 kg per day [5·90–8·68], 31·6% of baseline; 
p=0·0003, two-way ANOVA). Larger gains among older 
intervention-group participants were due to their lower 
baseline productivity than that of younger participants 
(40–44 years, 25·6 kg per day [95% CI 24·9–26·2]; 
≥50 years, 23·9 kg per day [23·1–24·7]; p=0·0018]), a 
deficit that disappeared during the evaluation period 
(40–44 years, 35·4 kg per day [34·5–36·2]; ≥50 years, 
35·1 kg per day [34·2–35·9]; p=0·607).
Intervention-group participants wore glasses during 
1547 (69·5%) of 2227 unannounced visits. Compliance 
reached 84·5% (539 of 638) during the last month of 
the evaluation period. Productivity in the intervention 
group rose as compliance with study glasses increased 
(figure 2). No control-group participants had purchased 
glasses during compliance assessments.
Among those completing questionnaires (intervention 
group: 311 [82·7%] of 376; control group: 319 [85·1%] of 
375), visual quality of life was significantly higher in 
the intervention group: the between-group difference 
in multiple regression models (same variables as for 
table 3) for VFQ-25 total score was 9·25 points (95% CI 
8·47–10·0; p<0·0001) and 29·1 points (27·1–31·1; 
p<0·0001) for the near activities subscore (both 100-point 
scales). Older age was associated with a lower near 
activities subscore in the control group (–1·20 points per 
year [95% CI –1·59 to –0·814], p<0·0001), but not in the 
intervention group (p=0·663).
The cost of glasses per person, including delivery, was 
$10·20. Among the 362 (92·8%) recipients of glasses

who responded to questionnaires, 356 (98·3%) found 
study glasses useful or very useful, 345 (95·3%) said 
they would recommend them to other tea pickers, and 
343 (94·8%) said they would pay for new glasses if 
theirs were lost or broken. The mean amount willing to 
pay increased with age: $5·57 at age 40–44 years, 
$6·03 at age 45–49 years, and $6·64 at age 50 years or 
older (Kendall’s tau bivariate correlation).
Discussion
In this randomised trial, we observed a significant 
increase in relative productivity of more than 
20% among intervention-group members in this rural 
cohort of mostly female participants, with a low-cost 
and widely accepted intervention of near glasses for 
correction of presbyopia. The effect size of 1·01 fell 
between large (>0·8) and very large (>1·2).21 Visual 
quality of life was also higher in the intervention group 
than in the control group, and almost all intervention-
group participants found study glasses useful and said 
they would pay for them.
Presbyopia is strongly associated with ageing,12 and 
we observed a significant interaction between age 
and study group for the main study outcome. Older 
participants in the intervention group had significantly 
greater productivity increases than younger participants, 
due to removal of their baseline deficit in productivity 
during the evaluation period, presumably because of the 
effects of corrective eyewear. Older participants in the 
control group, having more pronounced, uncorrected 
presbyopia, were less able than their younger peers to 
take advantage of higher tea yields during the peak high 
season, resulting in lower productivity increases. This 
strong interaction of age and productivity with study 
group adds to the biological plausibility of our results, as 
does the greater intervention-group productivity increase 
with improved study glasses compliance during the 
evaluation period.
We did two systematic reviews of studies done in 
low-income and middle-income countries: first, on the 
impact of presbyopia and second, on health interventions 
to improve work productivity. From the first systematic 
review, population studies of cohorts older than 40 years 
in rural China22 and Tanzania18 reported increased 
difficulty with near activities of daily living among 
individuals with presbyopia (increases of two times in 
China and eight times in Tanzania), although neither 
study assessed the effect of correction with glasses 
(low-quality data). Among 187 individuals aged 40 years 
or older in Zanzibar, most of whom had presbyopia, the 
effect size of giving glasses was substantial for various 
work-related activities of daily living (1·6–3·8, all 
p<0·001; moderate-quality data).23 We identified no 
randomised trials in this review.
From our second systematic search, we found an 
iron supplementation trial among 199 tea workers with 
anaemia in Sri Lanka4 that reported a significant effect 
on daily weight of tea picked for the intervention group 
only, but found no between-group difference. No 
signifi 
cant difference between groups in weight of tea 
picked was reported in a trial of iron and anthelmintics 
among 553 Bangladeshi tea workers.9 An Indonesian 
trial of iron supplementation involving 302 rubber 
plantation workers8 reported a significant (14·5%) 
difference between study groups in productivity for 
tappers, but not for weeders. Among 80 Chinese mill

workers receiving iron or placebo for 12 weeks,6 a 
significant (5·2%) increase in productivity was observed 
in the intervention group, but there was no between-
group difference. A Kenyan trial found no significant 
effect of caloric supple 
mentation on productivity 
among 224 con 
struction workers.7 Provision of 
mosquito netting in a trial involving 516 farmers in a 
malarial area of Zambia5 was associated with an 
improved harvest value of $76 (14·7%; p<0·05) 
compared with controls, although intervention-group 
farms were larger and more productive at baseline. In 
summary, few recent trials (only one since 2005) 
have assessed the impact of health interventions on 
productivity 
in 
low-income 
and 
middle-income 
countries. Only two studies5,8 provide evidence for a 
modest effect of iron supplementation, and possibly 
mosquito netting, on work productivity.
The relative productivity increase in our intervention 
group was as large as or larger than that reported for 
other health intervention trials in low-income and 
middle-income countries.4–9 Delivery of glasses to older 
workers could be a scalable and sustainable strategy for 
poverty alleviation. Our intervention was inexpensive 
and could potentially be sustained by employers bene-
fiting from productivity increases, or by workers 
themselves: 95% of intervention-group participants said 
they would pay for glasses, consistent with other 
reports.23 Medium-to-long-term retention of presbyopic 
glasses appears to be good, making provision logistically 
easy. Observed wear rates of our study glasses exceeded 
80% by closeout, in accordance with other findings of 
high acceptance and retention of presbyopic glasses in 
low-income and middle-income countries.23,24 Age-related 
decline in unaided near vision is essentially universal, 
so the pool of potential beneficiaries is large. Our data 
suggest that correction of even modest presbyopia 
(NVA ≤6/12), common in this setting, is associated 
with significant productivity gains. A study of Kenyan 
tea workers retiring for medical reasons25 reported 
decreased productivity of 16–18% in the last 18 months 
of work, similar to the declines observed in workers 
with uncorrected presbyopia in our study. This finding 
suggests that productivity increases from provision of 
glasses might be sufficient to prevent older workers 
from leaving the labour force because of age-related 
vision loss.
Inferences about the applicability of our results to 
other work settings are limited by incomplete data. It 
is unclear what proportion of economically productive 
activity among older people in low-income and

middle-income countries is sufficiently dependent on 
vision that correction of presbyopia would be useful. 
However, existing reports22,23 from low-income and middle-
income countries suggest that uncorrected presbyopia 
affects many economically important activities, including 
reading, writing, cooking, use of tools and mobile phones, 
sewing, weeding, and recognising money. Additional trials 
are needed in other work settings.
Other limitations of this study include the fact that, 
for practical and ethical reasons, participants were 
not masked to study group assignment, leaving open 
the possibility of placebo effects. The significant and 
biologically plausible interaction between age and study 
group makes a large placebo effect less plausible, 
although it cannot be excluded. Because of field team 
errors, 44 (5·85%) participants did not receive the 
allocated treatment, but the intention-to-treat analysis 
preserved the benefits of randomisation. Stratification 
of available data from 2016 rather than 2017 resulted 
in a modest but significant baseline difference in 
between-group produc 
tivity, although the difference-in-
difference analysis reduced the impact on results. Study 
strengths, besides the randomised controlled design, 
included completeness of data for the main study 
outcome and its determinants, no losses to follow-up, 
and selection of a rural, low-income population highly 
relevant to assessment of poverty alleviation strategies 
in low-income and middle-income countries.
