Summary
Background Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more eff
 ective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in 
postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer. However, it is not known whether 
anastrozole is more eff
 ective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS). Here, we compare the effi
  cacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with 
hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.
Methods In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been 
diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS. Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years. 
Randomisation was stratifi
 ed by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten). All trial personnel, 
participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment 
allocation. The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours. All 
analyses were done on a modifi
 ed intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke 
consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and 
corresponding confi
 dence intervals. This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.
Results Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries 
and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed). Median follow-up was 
7·2 years (IQR 5·6–8·9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded. We noted no statistically signifi
 cant diff
 erence 
in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·64–1·23]). The non-inferiority 
of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1·25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0·49). A total of 
69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·58–1·50], p=0·78), and no specifi
 c 
cause was more common in one group than the other. The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar 
between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-eff
 ect profi
 les of the two drugs 
diff
 ered, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more 
muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.
Conclusions No clear effi
  cacy diff
 erences were seen between the two treatments. Anastrozole off
 ers another treatment 
option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for 
some women with contraindications for tamoxifen. Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment 
diff
 erences.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women 
worldwide, with an estimated 1·6 million new cases 
reported every year.1 The proportion of these that are 
diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has 
substantially increased over the past few decades due to 
the introduction of mammographic screening. It is 
estimated that approximately a fi
 fth of all screen-detected 
breast cancers are DCIS.2
Management strategies for DCIS vary depending on 
histological grade, tumour characteristics, and extent of 
disease. Almost all aspects of treatment are controversial,

including the need for any treatment for some screen-
detected lesions,3 the extent of surgery,4 the use of 
radiotherapy,5,6 and the use of adjuvant endocrine 
therapy.7,8 The role of tamoxifen has been investigated in 
two large trials.7,8 In the National Surgical Adjuvant 
Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-24 trial,7 all women 
with DCIS received radiotherapy before being randomly 
assigned to tamoxifen or matching placebo. After a 
median of 6 years of follow-up, a signifi
 cant 
37% reduction in breast cancer recurrence was observed 
with tamoxifen compared with placebo.7 Retrospective 
evaluation of oestrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone 
receptors (PgR) in 732 patients from the original study 
showed that tamoxifen reduced subsequent breast cancer 
events by 51% for women with ER-positive DCIS.9 
However, no signifi
 cant benefi
 t with tamoxifen was 
observed for women with ER-negative DCIS. In the 
UK/ANZ DCIS trial,8 1578 women with locally excised 
DCIS were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen with 
or without radiotherapy. After a median of 12·7 years of 
follow-up, tamoxifen signifi
 cantly reduced all new breast 
cancer events by 29%, with a signifi
 cant impact on 
ipsilateral DCIS recurrence and contralateral tumours, 
but no eff
 ect on ipsilateral invasive recurrence.8
Until now no data have been available on the use of 
aromatase inhibitors for DCIS. Two trials of very similar 
design have been conducted. Both compared anastrozole 
with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ER-
positive or PgR-positive DCIS. The NSABP B-35 results 
will be reported elsewhere.10 Here, we report the fi
 rst 
results from the International Breast Cancer Intervention 
Study-II DCIS (IBIS-II DCIS).
Methods
Study design and participants
We undertook a double-blind, randomised, placebo-
controlled trial to compare anastrozole with tamoxifen 
for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral 
breast 
cancer. 
Participants 
were 
women 
aged 
40–70 years, postmenopausal, and had DCIS diagnosed 
within 6 months before randomisation. Microinvasion 
of less than 1 mm was permitted. Patients treated by 
mastectomy were not eligible for this study but could be 
included in the IBIS-II breast cancer prevention trial.11 
Radiotherapy was permitted according to local practice. 
Margin status was determined by the local pathologist 
and ER and PgR positivity was determined as greater 
than or equal to 5% positive cells (equivalent of Quick-
score of three or above and H-score of ten or above). 
After a protocol amendment on Feb 24, 2009, women 
were also allowed to enter the trial if they had been 
diagnosed 
with 
atypical 
hyperplasia 
or 
lobular 
carcinoma in situ to allow treatment of these benign 
breast diseases known to respond to tamoxifen.12,13
Exclusion criteria were: premenopausal at diagnosis; 
any previous diagnosis of breast cancer (including DCIS 
excised more than 6 months before randomisation or 
treated by mastectomy); diagnosis of any other cancer in 
the past 5 years (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer 
or in-situ cervical cancer); current treatment with anti-
coagulants; previous diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis, 
transient ischaemic attack, or cerebrovascular accident; 
previous or current use of selective oestrogen receptor 
modulators; intention to use menopausal hormone 
therapy; unexplained postmenopausal bleeding; evidence 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
A PubMed search between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2002 (with 
the terms “ductal carcinoma in situ”, “breast cancer”, “aromatase 
inhibitors”, and “endocrine therapy”) and discussion with 
colleagues yielded no clinical trials or large cohorts of women with 
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated by aromatase inhibitors. 
There have been two previous trials of tamoxifen. In the National 
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-24 trial, all 
women with DCIS received radiotherapy before being randomly 
assigned to tamoxifen or matching placebo. After a median of 
6 years of follow-up, a signifi
 cant 37% reduction in breast cancer 
recurrence was observed with tamoxifen compared with placebo. 
In the UK/ANZ DCIS trial, 1578 women with locally excised DCIS 
were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen with or without 
radiotherapy. After a median of 12·7 years of follow-up, 
tamoxifen signifi
 cantly reduced all new breast cancer events by 
29%, with a signifi
 cant eff
 ect on ipsilateral DCIS recurrence and 
contralateral tumours, but no eff
 ect on ipsilateral invasive 
recurrence. A further PubMed search was performed in October, 
2015, which found no further published articles except the 
NSABP B-35 trial conference abstract.
Added value of this study
In combination with the B-35 trial, this trial provides the fi
 rst 
evidence for the use of an aromatase inhibitor (here, anastrozole) 
compared with tamoxifen for postmenopausal women with 
locally excised hormone-receptor-positive DCIS after a median 
follow-up of 7·1 years. In this study, no clear effi
  cacy diff
 erences 
were seen between the two treatments, although all available 
evidence supports a greater effi
  cacy for anastrozole.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results are consistent with the small benefi
 t of anastrozole 
versus tamzifen as seen in the NSABP B-35 trial. This is also 
supported by direct evidence of greater effi
  cacy for recurrence 
in adjuvant trials of women with early invasive cancer and 
indirect evidence of greater effi
  cacy against new cancers in a 
preventive setting. Side-eff
 ect profi
 les between the drugs 
diff
 ered, but there was no clear overall advantage for either 
treatment. Anastrozole off
 ers another treatment option for 
postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive 
DCIS which might be more appropriate for some women with 
contraindications to tamoxifen.

of severe osteo 
porosis (T-score less than –4 at total hip or 
lumbar spine or more than two fragility fractures); 
history of lactose intolerance, glucose intolerance, or 
both; or life expectancy judged by the clinician to be less 
than 10 years.
All women provided written informed consent and the 
study was approved by the ethics committees of all 
participating institutions. The study sponsor was Queen 
Mary University of London.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive 1 mg/day oral anastrozole or 20 mg/day oral 
tamoxifen. Randomisation was stratifi
 ed by major centre 
or hub. Randomised blocks (six, eight, or ten) were used 
to maintain balance and randomisation was performed 
centrally by electronic contact with the main trials centre. 
All treatment was given on a daily basis for 5 years and all 
women took two tablets per day (tamoxifen and 
anastrozole placebo, or anastrozole and tamoxifen 
placebo). All IBIS-II DCIS personnel, participants, and 
clinicians were masked to treatment allocation, except for 
the IBIS-II DCIS trial statistician, who had access to 
unblinded data, and the independent data monitoring 
committee, who reviewed interim data for safety purposes.
Procedures
A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan within 2 years 
before entry to the trial and two lateral spinal 
radiographs were required to assess bone density and 
vertebral fractures. Women were seen at 6 months, 
12 months, and then annually up to the 5 year follow-up 
point at local clinics. Adherence to treatment was 
ascertained at each follow-up visit. After 5 years, follow-
up was annual and either by a short postal questionnaire 
or clinic visit, depending on country. Clinical adverse 
events were recorded during the post-treatment follow-
up period. Mammograms were performed at least every 
2 years. Blood samples were taken at baseline, year 1, 
and year 5 for the evaluation of potential biomarkers.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint of this analysis was the 
development of histologically confi
 rmed breast cancer, 
both invasive and new or recurrent DCIS. First events 
were further categorised as local recurrence (all ipsilateral 
disease), distant recurrence (including node-positive 
contralateral disease and recurrences at distant sites [eg, 
lung, bone, etc]), or isolated contralateral events. 
Secondary endpoints included ER status, breast cancer 
mortality, other cancers, cardiovascular disease, fractures, 
adverse 
events, 
and 
non-breast 
cancer 
deaths. 
Prespecifi
 ed subgroup analyses of recurrence were for 
invasive versus DCIS, contralateral versus ipsilateral, 
and ER status (ER positive vs ER negative); other 
subgroup analyses were exploratory. Further post-hoc 
analyses included PgR and HER2 receptor status for 
invasive recurrence only. Future plans are to explore 
outcomes by ER levels and HER2 status of the primary 
tumour when tissue collection is complete, and to

 ects of treatment after the initial 
5 year treatment period is completed.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were done on a modifi
 ed intention-to-treat 
basis, including all women who were enrolled, randomly 
assigned, and did not revoke consent for use of their 
data. Analyses of the effi
  cacy endpoints were based on 
hazard ratios (HRs). Cox proportional hazard models14,15 
were used to derive these with corresponding 95% CIs. 
The analysis plan fi
 rst tested non-inferiority of 
anastrozole (upper 95% CI of HR <1·25) and, if 
successful, then for the superiority of anastrozole. 
Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method.16 Secondary endpoints were compared using 
odds ratios (ORs), which closely approximate relative 
risk for rare events. Adverse events are presented if 
predefi
 ned or occurred in at least 5% of participants, and 
Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare adverse events 
when appropriate. Adherence was calculated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method, censoring at breast cancer 
recurrence, death, or 5 years of follow-up. All p values 
were two-sided.
We estimated a required sample size of 4000 on the 
basis of a 1·6% annual recurrence rate for tamoxifen-
treated patients with a 16·7% relative reduction for 
anastrozole to show non-inferiority, and a 33% reduction 
to show superiority with 5-year median follow-up. 
Recruitment to the trial closed on Feb 8, 2012, after 
enrolment of 2980 of the 4000 planned participants. 
During the course of the trial, local recurrences occurred 
at less than half the rate anticipated in the analysis plan, 
due largely to improvements in the surgical treatment of 
DCIS. Consequently, the required numbers of events 
anticipated in the protocol would not be reached for a 
number of years, and the IBIS-II steering committee, 
with the agreement of the independent data monitoring 
committee, took the decision to analyse and report the 
results at this stage; data were collected up to the cutoff
  
date of Sept 30, 2015.
All analyses were done using Stata version 13.1. This 
trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number 
ISRCTN37546358.
Role of the funding source
The study funders had no role in design, data collection,

publication.
Results
Between March 6, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we recruited 
2980 postmenopausal women with locally excised ER-
positive or PgR-positive DCIS in 236 centres from 
14 countries, and randomly assigned them to receive 
anastrozole (n=1471) or tamoxifen (n=1509; fi
 gure 1). A 
total of 42 women (22 in the anastrozole group, 20 in the 
tamoxifen group) withdrew their consent to use their 
data, leaving 2938 women for the primary analysis 
(fi
 gure 1). Baseline characteristics are presented in 
table 1. A further 26 women were found to be ineligible 
after randomisation (fi
 gure 1) but were included in the 
primary 
analysis. 
Median 
age 
was 
60·3 
years 
(IQR 56·1–64·6), and 658 (22%) were older than 65 years. 
Median 
body-mass 
index 
was 
26·7 
kg/m² 
(IQR 23·6–30·4), with 903 (31%) of women being obese 
(>30 kg/m²) at baseline (table 1). Median age at menarche 
was 13 years (IQR 12–14) and at birth of fi
 rst child was 
24 years (IQR 21–27), and 814 (28%) women had had a 
hysterectomy before trial entry. 1336 (45%) women had 
used menopausal hormone therapy before trial entry and 
two-thirds were never-smokers (table 1). Only nine 
women (<1%) with atypical hyperplasia or lobular 
carcinoma in situ were entered into the trial.
Baseline DCIS tumour characteristics are also shown 
in table 1. Median DCIS major diameter was 13 mm 
(IQR 7–22), median clear margin distance was 5 mm 
(IQR 2–10), and most women had either intermediate-
grade (1224; 42%) or high-grade (1129; 38%) tumours. 
Radiotherapy was given to 2091 (71%) women. Again, we 
noted no signifi
 cant diff
 erences between treatment 
groups.

The cutoff
  date for this analysis was Sept 30, 2015. 
Median follow-up was 7·2 years (IQR 5·6–8·9) 
and 
21 112 
women-years 
of 
follow-up 
were 
accrued (10 670 women-years for anastrozole and 
10 442 tamoxifen). 5 year adherence was estimated to be 
67·6% (95% CI 65·1–70·0) in the anastrozole group 
compared with 67·4% (64·9–69·7) in the tamoxifen 
group (p=0·71; appendix). The main reasons for 
treatment cessation were adverse events and patient 
decision (data not shown).
A total of 144 breast cancer recurrences were reported; 
recurrences were mostly invasive (84 [58%]; table 2). 
Numerically 
fewer 
recurrences 
occurred 
with 
anastrozole (67 recurrences; annual rate 0·64% [95% CI 
0·50–0·82]) than for tamoxifen (77; 0·72% [0·58–0·90]; 
HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·64–1·23]; fi
 gure 2). The non-
inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI 
<1·25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0·49). 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of recurrence at 5 years were 
2·5% (95% CI 1·8–3·5) for anastrozole and 3·0% 
(2·2–4·0) for tamoxifen. After 10 years of follow-up, 
recurrence was 6·6% (95% CI 4·9–8·8) and 7·3% 
(5·7–9·4), respectively.
Among the 144 recurrences, 86 (60%) were ER-positive, 
30 (21%) were ER-negative, and ER status was missing 
for 28 (19%). Among women with ER-positive 
recurrences, 30 (2%) were in the anastrozole group 
compared with 56 (4%) in the tamoxifen group (HR 0·55 
[95% CI 0·35–0·86], p=0·008). Among women with ER-
negative recurrences, 17 (1%) were in the anastrozole 
group compared with 13 (<1%) in the tamoxifen group 
(HR 1·34 [95% CI 0·65–2·75], p=0·43).
Analyses 
adjusted 
by 
age, 
body-mass 
index, 
menopausal hormone therapy use, grade, margins, and 
radiotherapy subgroups yielded similar HRs as in the 
univariate analyses (table 2). Similar numbers of DCIS 
recurrences were observed in each treatment group 
(29 for anastrozole vs 30 for tamoxifen; HR 0·99 [95% CI 
0·60–1·65], p=0·98; table 2).
A total of 69 deaths had been reported by the cutoff
  
date (appendix). Overall, we noted no statistically 
signifi
 cant diff
 erence between treatment arms (33 for 
anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0·93 [95% CI 
0·58–1·50], p=0·78) and no specifi
 c cause of death 
diff
 ered by treatment group. Only four deaths from 
breast cancer were recorded, one in the anastrozole 
group and three in the tamoxifen group. Overall, the 
frequency of cancers other than breast was not 
signifi
 cantly diff
 erent in the anastrozole and tamoxifen 
groups (61 vs 71; OR 0·88 [95% CI 0·61–1·26], p=0·47; 
table 3). However, endometrial, ovarian, and skin cancers 
were signifi
 cantly more common with tamoxifen 
(table 2).
We collected a comprehensive record of side-eff
 ects 
during the 5 years of treatment (table 4). The number of 
women reporting any event was similar between 
treatment groups overall (1323 for anastrozole vs 1379 for

tamoxifen) but the specifi
 c profi
 les were diff
 erent. 
Fractures were signifi
 cantly higher in the anastrozole 
group (129 vs 100; OR 1·36 [95% CI 1·03–1·80], p=0·027) 
and musculoskeletal adverse events such as joint 
stiff
 ness, paraesthesia, carpal tunnel syndrome, and 
osteoporosis were also signifi
 cantly higher with 
anastrozole 
(table 
4). 
Hyper 
cholesterolaemia 
was 
furthermore signifi
 cantly more common in women 
receiving anastrozole compared with those receiving 
tamoxifen, probably as a result of the cholesterol-
reducing eff
 ects of tamoxifen. By contrast, anastrozole 
was associated with substantially fewer muscle spasms 
compared with tamoxifen (25 [2%] vs 106 [7%]; OR 0·23 
[95% CI 0·14–0·36], p<0·0001).
Apart from vaginal dryness, gynaecological symptoms 
were signifi
 cantly higher with tamoxifen. Vasomotor 
symptoms were common in both treatment groups, but 
the frequency was signifi
 cantly lower with anastrozole 
(818 [56%] vs 899 [60%]; OR 0·85 [95% CI 0·73–0·99], 
p=0·0310; table 4). We noted a signifi
 cant decrease in 
pulmonary emboli and deep vein thromboses (seven vs 
24; OR 0·30 [95% CI 0·11–0·71], p=0·0028). No 
statistically 
signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence 
was 
seen 
for 
cardiovascular events overall or myocardial infarction in 
particular (table 4). However, transient ischaemic attacks 
(13 vs fi
 ve; OR 2·69 [95% CI 0·90–9·65], p=0·05) and 
particularly cerebrovascular accidents (13 vs four; 3·36 
[1·04–14·18], 0·025) were increased with anastrozole.
Despite the diff
 erences in side-eff
 ect profi
 les, treatment 
adherence was virtually identical between treatment 
groups and was 67·6% for anastrozole and 67·4% for 
tamoxifen after 5 years (appendix).
In a post-hoc analysis, we assessed diff
 erences by 
subgroups of tumour for invasive recurrence (fi
 gure 3). 
The largest diff
 erence was noted for invasive ER-positive/
HER2-negative tumours (10 recurrences with anastrozole 
vs 28 with tamoxifen; HR 0·37 [95% CI 0·18–0·75], 
p=0·0060; fi
 gure 3). HER2-positive tumours showed 
better effi
  cacy with tamoxifen (HR 1·62 [95% CI 
0·53–4·96]; heterogeneity p=0·05; fi
 gure 3).
We did not fi
 nd a diff
 erential eff
 ect on recurrence 
according to radiotherapy use at baseline (54 recurrences 
with radiotherapy vs 30 with no radiotherapy; 
HR 0·77 [95% CI 0·49–1·21], p=0·25). Furthermore, 
anastrozole was not more eff
 ective at reducing invasive 
recurrences in those women who had radiotherapy at 
baseline (HR 0·77 [95% CI 0·45–1·32], p=0·34) 
compared with those who did not (0·86 [0·42–1·77], 
p=0·69; heterogeneity p=0·79; fi
 gure 3).
In a post-hoc analysis, we excluded 26 women who 
were found to be ineligible after randomisation (fi
 gure 1). 
Exclusion of these women from the primary analysis did 
not alter the results (data not shown). Furthermore, 
exclusions of the nine (<1%) women with atypical 
hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in-situ from a post-hoc 
reassessment of the primary endpoint analysis had no 
eff
 ect on the results (data not shown).
Discussion
In this large, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial comparing anastrozole with tamoxifen in 
women with ER-positive or PgR-positive DCIS treated by 
wide local excision with or without breast radiotherapy, 
the non-inferiority of anastrozole to tamoxifen was 
demonstrated, but a signifi
 cant superiority effi
  cacy was 
not, although we noted a slightly lower recurrence rate 
for anastrozole. However, the overall event rate was lower 
than anticipated, which might have contributed to non-
signifi
 cant results with wide confi
 dence intervals, and as 
a result smaller eff
 ects of anastrozole might have been 
missed. This possible small benefi
 t for anastrozole is 
consistent with the larger 27% reduction seen in the 
similar NSABP B-35 trial, which was statistically 
signifi
 cant (p=0·03).10 Trials in the adjuvant setting have 
also indicated greater effi
  cacy for anastrozole and other 
aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen.17,18 Additionally, 
the reduction in contralateral breast cancer is consistent 
with the benefi
 ts of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen 
seen in the ATAC trial17 and compared with placebo in 
the IBIS-II breast cancer prevention trial.11 The greater 
effi
  cacy of anastrozole for ER-positive or HER2-negative 
invasive recurrence has been seen elsewhere for invasive 
disease.19 HER2 status was not routinely collected for the 
baseline tumour, but tumour blocks are being collected 
retrospectively and its impact along with other markers 
will be reported at a later stage. Local recurrence rates 
were lower than those predicted on the basis of earlier 
trials. This is probably caused by greater attention to

achieving clear surgical margins, and improvements in 
and more frequent use of radiotherapy.
Clear diff
 erences were seen in the side-eff
 ect profi
 le. 
Many side-eff
 ects followed the expected pattern seen 
during treatment of invasive cancer,18 with a higher 
fracture rate and more musculoskeletal events with 
anastrozole, and more venous thromboembolic events, 
gynaecological events, and vasomotor symptoms with 
tamoxifen. The higher rate of strokes with anastrozole is 
surprising because this pattern was not seen in ATAC 
(62 strokes with anastrozole vs 80 with tamoxifen),17 or 
the prevention component of IBIS-II (three with 
anastrozole vs six with placebo),11 and these events were 
not lower for tamoxifen when compared with placebo in 
IBIS-I (ten with tamoxifen vs 12 with placebo).20 
Tamoxifen has previously been reported to reduce 
headache occurrence,20,21 so the higher rate of headache 
in the anastrozole group of our trial probably resulted 
from this rather than the eff
 ects of anastrozole. However, 
increased hypertension was seen for anastrozole in both 
ATAC17 and IBIS-II prevention;11 the small increase in our 
anastrozole group therefore seems to be a real treatment 
eff
 ect, although the mechanism is not understood.
Although occurrence of other cancers was similar 
overall, the incidence of specifi
 c cancers diff
 ered by 
treatment. A two-to-three-fold increase in endometrial 
cancer is well documented for tamoxifen,22,23 by contrast 
with a reduced incidence compared with the general 
population anticipated for anastrozole in view of the 
strong hormone dependence for this tumour.24 In 
combination, these two eff
 ects account for the striking 
diff
 erence seen here. Ovarian cancer is not known to be 
aff
 ected by tamoxifen and the diff
 erences here probably 
result from a preventive eff
 ect of anastrozole, as 
previously seen in IBIS-II prevention (four cases with 
anastrozole vs seven with placebo) and indirectly in ATAC 
(ten with anastrozole vs 17 with tamoxifen), and supported 
by the increased risk associated with use of menopausal 
hormone therapy.25 A decrease of colorectal cancer has 
been reported in users of menopausal hormone therapy;26 
although a small increase was reported in ATAC (39 cases 
with anastrozole vs 31 with tamoxifen), a lower risk was 
seen in IBIS-II prevention (three with anastrozole vs 
11 with tamoxifen), so the role of aromatase inhibitors in 
aff
 ecting risk of colorectal cancer remains uncertain.
The major strengths of this study include its 
multinational nature, large size, moderate length of 
follow-up, and detailed collection of side-eff
 ect data. The 
major limitation of this trial was the lower-than-expected 
event rate, which adds uncertainty about the lack of 
signifi
 cance of some of the small diff
 erences seen. A few 
unexpected side-eff
 ects were also recorded, which 
require further validation in view of the amount of 
multiple testing. It is too early to assess the eff
 ect of these 
treatments on mortality and long-term follow-up; a full 
meta-analysis of all major endpoints with the B-35 study 
is planned to study these issues.
In summary, anastrozole off
 ers another option for 
postmenopausal women with ER-positive DCIS, and the 
choice between it and tamoxifen will probably depend 
more on previous history of other conditions (eg, 
osteoporosis and venous thrombosis) and short-term 
tolerability (musculoskeletal, vasomotor, and gynae-
cological symptoms) than diff
 erences in effi
  cacy.
