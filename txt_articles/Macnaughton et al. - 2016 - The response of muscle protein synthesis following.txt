Abstract
The currently accepted amount of protein required to achieve maximal stimu-
lation of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) following resistance exercise is
20–25 g. However, the influence of lean body mass (LBM) on the response of
MPS to protein ingestion is unclear. Our aim was to assess the influence of
LBM, both total and the amount activated during exercise, on the maximal
response of MPS to ingestion of 20 or 40 g of whey protein following a bout
of whole-body resistance exercise. Resistance-trained males were assigned to a
group with lower LBM (≤65 kg; LLBM n = 15) or higher LBM (≥70 kg;
HLBM n = 15) and participated in two trials in random order. MPS was mea-
sured with the infusion of 13C6-phenylalanine tracer and collection of muscle
biopsies following ingestion of either 20 or 40 g protein during recovery from
a single bout of whole-body resistance exercise. A similar response of MPS
during exercise recovery was observed between LBM groups following protein
ingestion (20 g – LLBM: 0.048 � 0.018%�h�1; HLBM: 0.051 � 0.014%�h�1;
40 g – LLBM: 0.059 � 0.021%�h�1; HLBM: 0.059 � 0.012%�h�1). Overall
(groups combined), MPS was stimulated to a greater extent following inges-
tion of 40 g (0.059 � 0.020%�h�1) compared with 20 g (0.049 � 0.020%�h�1;
P = 0.005) of protein. Our data indicate that ingestion of 40 g whey protein
following whole-body resistance exercise stimulates a greater MPS response
than 20 g in young resistance-trained men. However, with the current doses,
the total amount of LBM does not seem to influence the response.
Introduction
The stimulatory effects of resistance exercise and amino
acid provision on muscle protein synthesis (MPS) are well-
documented (Biolo et al. 1997; Tipton and Wolfe 2004).
Whereas amino acid provision from protein feeding alone
stimulates MPS above basal rates (Morton et al. 2015;
Witard et al. 2016), the combination of amino acid provi-
sion and resistance exercise results in greater stimulation of
MPS than amino acid provision alone (Biolo et al. 1997).
The type of protein ingested, timing of protein ingestion
and amount of protein ingested in any given serving influ-
ence the response of MPS following exercise (Witard et al.
2016). Of these factors, the amount of protein ingested fol-
lowing exercise seems to have the most impact on MPS
during recovery from resistance exercise. Hence, there is
continuing interest in determining the factors that may
influence the dose of ingested protein required to stimulate
maximal MPS during exercise recovery while limiting sig-
nificant amino acid oxidation.

 Based on available evidence, a 20–25 g dose of high
quality protein is considered sufficient to maximally stim-
ulate MPS after resistance exercise in young adults (Mor-
ton et al. 2015; Witard et al. 2016). Results from the
seminal study by Moore et al. (2009) demonstrated that
ingestion of 40 g of egg protein following bilateral leg
resistance exercise stimulated a similar response of MPS
compared with 20 g of egg protein. We replicated these
findings, detecting no statistically significant difference in
the response of MPS to unilateral leg-only resistance exer-
cise after ingesting 20 or 40 g of whey protein in resis-
tance-trained young men (Witard et al. 2014). Taken
together, these data support the recommendation that
ingesting ~20–25 g of high-quality protein after exercise
will maximize stimulation of MPS during recovery from
leg-only resistance exercise.
One attribute that may influence the response of MPS
to ingested protein following exercise is total muscle
mass. It is often assumed that young adults possessing
greater amounts of muscle mass require a larger dose of
protein for maximal stimulation of MPS compared with
young adults that possess less muscle mass (Churchward-
Venne et al. 2012b; Morton et al. 2015; Witard et al.
2016). Therefore, it may be necessary for individuals with
greater muscle mass to ingest greater amounts of protein
for maximal stimulation of MPS. Consequently, it seems
intuitive to propose that the uptake of amino acids by a
greater amount of muscle mass may be limited by a given
amount of ingested protein. An extension to the notion
that total muscle mass influences the dose response of
MPS to protein ingestion is that the total amount of
muscle involved in the exercise bout also will influence
the MPS response. Prior resistance exercise increases
blood flow to skeletal muscle, resulting in increased deliv-
ery and transport of amino acids into the activated mus-
cle (Biolo et al. 1997). Thus, more exogenous amino
acids would be necessary to ensure that delivery of amino
acids to any given muscle would not be limiting. This
concept is intuitively satisfying, but to our knowledge no
study has directly investigated the influence of muscle
mass on the response of MPS to protein ingestion. There-
fore, in the present study we examined the response of
MPS to two doses of whey protein ingested following
exercise involving a greater amount of muscle mass, that
is, a whole-body exercise routine. We intended to maxi-
mize the difference in the amount of muscle exercised
and the potential influence of muscle mass, both exercised
muscle and muscle not involved in the exercise bout, on
the response of MPS to protein ingestion.
The primary aim of the present study was to determine
the response of MPS to two different doses of protein fol-
lowing a bout of whole-body resistance exercise in resis-
tance-trained
males
with
a
large
amount
of
LBM
compared to those with a smaller amount of LBM. We
hypothesized that the group with higher LBM would
require more protein for maximal stimulation of MPS
during recovery from whole-body resistance exercise com-
pared with the group with lower LBM.
Methods
Participants
Thirty healthy, resistance-trained (≥2 sessions per week
for previous 6 months) males participated in the present
study and were grouped according to LBM. Fifty-six par-
ticipants
were
recruited
and
those
that
possessed
LBM ≤ 65 kg were categorized as the lower lean body
mass (LLBM) group (n = 15) and LBM ≥ 70 kg were cat-
egorized as the higher lean body mass (HLBM) group
(n = 15). Volunteers with LBM between these values were
not eligible to participate in the present study. The cur-
rent study conformed to the standards of the latest ver-
sion of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013) and the NHS
West of Scotland Ethics Committee (REC number 12/
WS/0316) approved the study. The nature of the study
and its associated risks were explained to the participants
in
lay
terms
before
informed
written
consent
was
obtained.
Experimental design
In a two-group, randomized, double-blind, crossover
design, each volunteer participated in two infusion trials
designed to measure the response of MPS following
whole-body resistance exercise and whey protein inges-
tion. Trials were separated by ~2 weeks. Each infusion
trial included the ingestion of either 20 or 40 g of whey
protein isolate (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) as a
500 mL drink immediately after exercise. The order of
infusion trials, and thus dose of ingested protein, was
randomized and an independent investigator prepared the
drinks.
Preliminary testing
Prior to study inclusion, participant LBM was assessed
using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (GE
Healthcare
Systems,
Hertfordshire).
Participants
with
either ≤65 kg LBM or ≥70 kg LBM were included in the
study. Each participant’s one repetition maximum (1
RM) was assessed using a previously validated protocol
(Baechle and Earle 2008) on select resistance exercise
machines (Cybex International, MA); chest press, latis-
simus pull-down, leg curl, leg press, and leg extension in
this order. All leg exercises were carried out unilaterally,

 that is, on one leg at a time. Participants returned
~1 week later (at least 3 days prior to the first infusion
trial) to confirm their 1 RM. Participant characteristics
for each group are presented in Table 1.
Dietary and activity control
Each participant completed a 3 days weighed food diary
that was analysed using the nutritional analysis software
package Wisp Version 4.0 (Tinuvel Software Systems,
Anglesey, UK). Each participant’s control diet was based
on the self-recorded intakes of the participants and
matched the energy intake and composition of their
habitual diet (Table 2). Diets were tailored to the individ-
ual’s food preferences and were supplied in food packages
for a 48 h period prior to both infusion trials. Partici-
pants completed a 7 days activity diary and were asked to
keep their activity consistent during the study period.
Participants were instructed to refrain from strenuous
exercise 48 h before the infusion trials.
Experimental protocol
A schematic diagram of the experimental protocol is pre-
sented in Figure 1. Participants arrived at the research
laboratories of the Health and Exercise Sciences Research
Group at the University of Stirling at ~0600 h after an
overnight fast. Upon arrival body mass was measured
before a 20-gauge cannula was inserted into a forearm
vein and a fasted blood sample was collected. Participants
were
then
provided
with
a
standardized
breakfast
(7 kcal�kg�1 body mass) consisting of 50% of energy as
carbohydrate, 30% of energy as protein and 20% of
energy as fat. After breakfast participants rested in a
semisupine position for 2 h before a primed constant
infusion (0.05 lmol�kg�1�min�1; 2.0 lmol�kg�1 prime) of
L- [ring-13C6] phenylalanine (Cambridge Isotope Labora-
tories, MA) was initiated through a 0.2 lm filter. Another
20-gauge cannula was inserted into a vein on the con-
tralateral hand or distal portion of the arm for frequent
blood sampling. The cannula was periodically flushed
with 0.9% saline solution and the arm was wrapped in a
heated blanket to allow arterialized blood sampling.
Approximately 1 h after starting the infusion participants
performed an acute bout of resistance exercise on the fol-
lowing machines in the following order; chest press, latis-
simus pull-down, leg curl, leg press, and leg extension.
Leg exercises were performed for both legs unilaterally,
that is, one leg at a time. Participants worked at 75% of
their 1 RM at a cadence of 1 sec concentric – 2 sec eccen-
tric contraction. Each participant was instructed to com-
plete three sets of 10 repetitions with a final fourth set to
volitional failure, to ensure that each participant was
working at the same relative intensity. The exercise bout
for the second trial was matched to the first. There were
no significant differences between trials in volume (work-
load 9 repetitions) performed for any of the exercises.
Immediately after exercise, a skeletal muscle biopsy was
obtained from the vastus lateralis under sterile conditions
and local anaesthesia (2% lidocaine) using a 5 mm Berg-
strom needle modified for manual suction. Participants
then consumed a drink that contained either 20 or 40 g
of a whey protein isolate made up in 500 mL of
water (t = 0 min). Drinks were enriched to 6% with
L- [ring-13C6] phenylalanine tracer. Subsequent muscle

 biopsies were obtained from the same leg at 180 and
300 min. During the second trial the participants con-
sumed the alternate dose of protein from the first trial and
biopsies were obtained from the contralateral leg. Arterial-
ized blood samples were obtained at t = �60, 0, 15, 30,
45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min. The infusion was
stopped following collection of the final blood sample at
300 min. Muscle samples were cleaned with ice cold 0.9%
saline solution and were blotted, removing any blood, fat
or connective tissue before being frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at �80°C for further analysis. Blood samples
were dispensed into EDTA- and sodium heparin- contain-
ing vacutainers and centrifuged at 2500 g for 15 min at
4°C. Plasma was extracted into ~0.5 mL aliquots and
stored at �80°C for further analysis.
Plasma analysis
Plasma samples were analysed for leucine, phenylalanine,
and threonine concentrations using the internal standard
method, as well as phenylalanine and tyrosine enrich-
ments
using
gas-chromatography,
mass-spectrometry
(GCMS) as previously described (Witard et al. 2014).
Briefly,
plasma
samples
were
thawed
before
adding
acetic acid (1:1 dilution) and internal standard (U-[13C6]
leucine
0.52 mmol�L�1;
U-[13C9
15N]
phenylalanine
0.50 mmol�L�1; U-[13C4
15N] threonine 0.58 mmol�L�1).
Next, amino acids were extracted and purified on cation-
exchange columns (Dowex 50WX8 hydrogen form 100–
200 mesh resin, Sigma Aldrich, Dorset). Samples were
dried under N2 gas before being converted to their tert-
butyl dimethylsilyl derivative (MTBSTFA). Finally, 2 lL
of derivatized sample was injected into the GCMS (Agi-
lent, Santa Clara, CA). Ions were monitored at m/z 302/
308 for leucine, 336/346 and 234/240 for phenylalanine,
404/409 for threonine and 466/472 for tyrosine in split
mode (1:50 split ratio).
Plasma urea concentrations were measured at each time
point using an automated laboratory analyser (Instrumen-
tation Laboratory, Milano).
Muscle analysis
Muscle samples (30–35 mg) were homogenized in 500 lL
0.6 mol L�1 perchloric acid (PCA) prior to centrifugation
at 3500 g. The supernatant was collected and a further
500 lL 0.6 mol L�1 PCA was added and was spun at
4500 rpm. This step was repeated. The resulting accumu-
lation of supernatant had internal standard (U-[13C6]
leucine
0.01 mmol�L�1;
U-[13C9
15N]
phenylalanine
0.01 mmol�L�1) added to it. The supernatant and internal
standard were added to the cation-exchange columns and
analysis continued as described above for plasma. Finally,
4 lL of intracellular (IC) sample was injected into the
GCMS (same conditions as plasma analysis detailed
above) and was run in splitless mode. IC leucine was
detected at m/z 302/308 and phenylalanine (concentration
and enrichment) at m/z 336/342 and 336/346.
Following IC extraction from the muscle sample the
protein pellet was rinsed with doubly distilled H2O before

 being further homogenized in homogenization buffer
(7.5 lL�mg�1 muscle; 50 mmol L�1 Tris-HCl, 1 mmol
L�1 EDTA, 1 mmol L�1 EGTA 10 mmol L�1 b-glycero-
phosphate, 50 mmol L�1 NaF). Samples were spun and
rinsed, removing the supernatant between spins. There-
after, 0.3 mol L�1 NaOH was added and samples were
heated at 50°C for 30 min with periodic spinning. The
supernatant was collected and 0.3 mol L�1 NaOH was
added to the pellet and spun before the supernatant was
added to the previous collection. Next, 1 mol L�1 PCA
was added to supernatant and spun. The resulting super-
natant was removed and discarded; the remaining pellet
was rinsed twice in ethanol. The pellet was hydrolysed
overnight at 110°C in 0.5 mol L�1 HCl and 1 mL of acti-
vated resin. The hydrolysed samples were purified on the
cation-exchange columns and dried under N2. Samples
were converted to their n-acetyl, n-propyl ester (NAP)
derivative. Finally, 1 lL of derivatized sample was injected
into a gas-chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass
spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, Hertfordshire, UK) and
run in splitless mode monitoring m/z 44/45 carbon ratio.
p70S6K1 activity assays
Muscle tissue (~30–50 mg) was homogenized in a 10-fold
volume of homogenization buffer (50 mmol L�1 TrisHCl
pH 7.5, 0.1 mmol L�1 EGTA, 1 mmol L�1 EDTA, 1% (v/
v) TritonX-100, 50 mmol L�1 NaF, 5 mmol L�1 NaPPi,
0.27 mol L�1 sucrose, 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol
L�1 Na3(OV)4, and 1 Complete (Roche) protease inhibi-
tor tablet per 10 mL) using dounce homogenization.
Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 4°C for
45 min at 21,000 9 g. The protein concentration of each
sample
was
quantified
using
the
DC
protein
assay
(BioRad, Hertfordshire, UK) and Gen 5 software (BioTek,
Vermont) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Total p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) was immuno-
precipitated from the lysate for 2 h at 4°C in homoge-
nization buffer with 4 lg p70S6K1 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc, Heidelberg, Germany). Activity assays
were then performed as previously described (McGlory
et al. 2014).
Calculations
Myofibrillar fractional synthesis rate (FSR) was calculated
using the standard precursor product equation below:
FSR ¼ ½ðEB2 � EB1Þ=ðEIC � tÞ� � 100
where EB (B2 is the biopsy at the later time point, B1 is
the biopsy from the earlier time point) is the enrichment
of bound phenylalanine, EIC is the IC phenylalanine
enrichment of the biopsies and t is time of tracer
incorporation (h). IC phenylalanine enrichment was used
as the precursor in all FSR calculations.
Plasma and IC amino acid concentrations were calcu-
lated by the internal standard method:
C ¼ Qis=V � Eis
where Qis is the amount of internal standard added to the
sample,
V
is
the
volume
of
plasma
or
IC
water
(663 mL�kg�1 muscle) (Biolo et al. 1995) and Eis is the
internal standard tracer to tracee ratio in the plasma.
Whole-body phenylalanine oxidation rates were esti-
mated using the phenylalanine balance model based
on the hydroxylation of L- [ring-13C6] phenylalanine to
L- [ring-13C6] tyrosine, without measuring 13CO2 enrich-
ment in the breath (Thompson et al. 1989):
Pt=Pp � ðQ2
p=ðEp=EtÞ � 1Þ � ðF þ QpÞ
where Pt/Pp is the molar ratio of fluxes of tyrosine and
phenylalanine, Qp equals the rate of disappearance of
phenylalanine under steady state conditions, Ep is the
enrichment of phenylalanine, Et is the enrichment of tyro-
sine and F equals the infusion rate.
Incremental area under the curve (AUC) for plasma
amino acid and urea concentrations, as well as rate of
phenylalanine oxidation, was calculated using GraphPad
Prism (V6, Graphpad Software Incorporation, California).
AUC of urea concentrations and phenylalanine oxidation
rates was calculated from a baseline = 0 for each and for
amino acid concentrations the baseline was calculated
from the concentration at t = 0 min time point.
Statistical analysis
Data were plotted in graphical format to assess normal
distribution using Minitab Version 17.0 (Minitab Soft-
ware Systems, State College, PA). Box cox transformations
were performed on data that were not normally dis-
tributed. The statistical significance level was set at
P = 0.05.
Anthropometric,
strength
and
dietary
data
(HLBM vs. LLBM)
were analysed
using
one
factor
(group) ANOVA using SPSS (Version 21, IBM UK Ltd,
Hampshire). Plasma amino acid and urea concentrations
and phenylalanine oxidation rates were analysed using
repeated measures ANOVA with dose (2 levels) and time
(12 levels) as within-factors and group (HLBM and
LLBM) as a between-factor. AUC for plasma amino acid
and urea concentrations and phenylalanine oxidation
rates were calculated and analysed using a repeated mea-
sures ANOVA with dose as a within-factor and group as
a between-factor. Myofibrillar FSR and IC amino acid
concentrations (leucine and phenylalanine) were anal-
ysed using a mixed model, repeated-measures ANOVA
in SPSS, with dose (2 levels) and time (3 levels) as

calculated for IC leucine and phenylalanine concentra-
tions and analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA

Cohen’s effect size (d) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were calculated for group and dose. Effect sizes of 0.2 are
considered small, 0.5 considered medium and >0.8 are
considered large (Cohen 1988). If 0 was not contained
within the confidence intervals for the effect size the effect
was deemed significant.
Results
Blood and muscle intracellular amino acid
concentrations
Plasma leucine concentrations peaked at 45 min with 20 g
of ingested whey protein and at 60 min with 40 g in both
groups (Fig. 2A). Plasma leucine concentrations were
higher at 45 (d = 1.81; CI = 1.21–2.42), 60 (d = 3.13;
CI = 2.38–3.89),
90
(d = 2.64;
CI = 1.94–3.33)
and
120 min (d = 2; CI = 1.38–2.63) in both groups with 40 g
compared with 20 g of whey protein whilst being elevated
also at 30 min (d = 1.13; CI = 0.36–1.90) in LLBM.
Plasma leucine concentrations for 40 g were higher in
LLBM than HLBM at 90 min (d = 1.26; CI = 0.48–2.04)
(group 9 time 9 dose
interaction;
P = 0.048).
Plasma
leucine concentrations, expressed as AUC after protein
ingestion,
were

tein (49,108 � 6516 nmol�mL�1 9 300 min) (d = 2.68;
CI = 1.98–3.38). With 40 g plasma leucine AUC was 1.3-
fold greater in the LLBM (74,630 � 6122 nmol�mL�1 9
300 min)
than
HLBM
(66,526 � 6901

action; P = 0.039) (data not shown).
Plasma phenylalanine concentrations were greater with
40 g compared with 20 g of ingested whey protein at 30
(d = 0.94, CI = 0.40–1.47), 45 (d = 1.33, CI = 0.77–1.89),
60 (d = 2.08; CI = 1.46–2.71), and 90 min (d = 1.32;

primarily driven by the 180 min time point. The effect
sizes for each time point were as follows; 0 min d = 0.02;
CI = �0.49 to 0.53; 180 min d = 0.48; CI = �0.03 to
0.99; 300 min d = �0.08; CI = �0.58 to 0.43. The activ-
ity of p70S6K1 was greater at 180 min compared with
0 min (main effect of time; P = 0.008), but there were no
differences in p70S6K1 activity between 0 and 300 min
time points or 180 and 300 min time points.
Discussion
The primary aim of the present study was to investigate
the response of MPS to two doses of protein following
whole-body resistance exercise in trained young males
with higher and lower amounts of LBM. We hypothesized
that individuals with greater LBM would require more
protein for greater stimulation of MPS during recovery
from whole-body resistance exercise compared with indi-
viduals with lower LBM. Our novel findings demonstrate
that, overall, ingesting a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate
stimulated MPS to a greater extent than a 20 g dose of
whey protein isolate during acute (0–300 min) exercise
recovery in young, resistance-trained males. However,
contrary with our hypothesis, the response of MPS fol-
lowing whole-body resistance exercise was similar in both
groups
of
resistance-trained
males,
despite
different
amounts of LBM.
The general consensus within the scientific literature is
that ingestion of 20–25 g of protein after resistance exer-
cise is sufficient for the maximal stimulation of MPS
(Churchward-Venne et al. 2012b; Morton et al. 2015;
Witard et al. 2016). Previous studies in young, resistance-
trained males reported no statistically significant differ-
ence in the response of MPS to ingestion of 20 or 40 g of
protein
after
resistance
exercise
(Moore
et al.
2009;
Witard et al. 2014). However, in the present study we
demonstrated that ingestion of 40 g of protein signifi-
cantly increased myofibrillar MPS compared to ingestion
of 20 g of protein after resistance exercise. The reason
our results and previous results (Moore et al. 2009;
Witard et al. 2014) do not agree cannot be determined
with absolute certainty, but methodological differences
exist between studies that may offer some explanation.
We believe the most likely explanation for the difference
in response of MPS to resistance exercise and protein
ingestion is the amount of muscle activated during the
exercise bout. Whereas our participants performed a bout
of whole-body resistance exercise, those in Moore et al.

Muscle Protein Synthesis, Whole-Body Resistance Exercise And Protein
 (2009) and Witard et al. (2014) performed leg only exer-
cise bouts (bilateral and unilateral, respectively). Accord-
ingly, we suggest that the overall demand for amino acids
following a bout of whole-body resistance exercise is
greater compared to a bout of unilateral or bilateral leg
resistance exercise. Nutritive blood flow increases follow-
ing resistance exercise (Biolo et al. 1995) facilitating the
delivery of amino acids to the working muscle. Resistance
exercise increases amino acid transport and uptake into
the muscle (Biolo et al. 1995). Therefore, the greater the
amount
of
muscle
activated
the
greater
the
overall
amount of amino acids taken up by muscle after exercise.
Moreover,
Pennings
et al.
(2011)
demonstrated
that
incorporation of amino acids from exogenous protein for
de novo MPS was greater in exercised than rested muscle.
Consequently, MPS is higher in response to resistance
exercise followed by protein feeding compared with feed-
ing alone (Pennings et al. 2011; Witard et al. 2014). Thus,
the greater the amount of muscle utilized during a resis-
tance exercise bout, the greater the demand for amino
acids that must be met by exogenous sources for MPS to
be increased in any given muscle. Furthermore, blood
flow is reduced to any given muscle when other muscles
are activated compared to when one muscle group alone
is exercised (Volianitis and Secher 2002), thus reducing
amino acid delivery to any particular muscle. We propose
that amino acid supply may have been insufficient with
ingestion of 20 g whey protein to meet the demands of
the exercised muscle during recovery from whole-body
resistance exercise. Thus, MPS in the measured muscle is
lower when only 20 g of whey protein was ingested fol-
lowing whole-body resistance exercise. Conversely, in the
40 g trial there were more amino acids available for all
the exercised muscles and MPS measured in the legs likely
was able to respond at a greater rate. Hence, whole-body
resistance exercise seems to lead to a broader dispersal of
ingested amino acids and thus the stimulation of MPS by
ingestion of 20 g of whey protein is limited by amino
acid availability in some muscles compared to ingestion
of 40 g of whey protein.
The notion that amino acid availability to any single
muscle may be limited with whole-body exercise may
help explain the seemingly low FSR values that we report
in the present study. The mean FSR values are approxi-
mately 71% and 76% of the FSR values for the 20 and
40 g, respectively, doses of whey protein that we reported
previously (Witard et al. 2014). The lower FSR values in
the present study seem to be consistent with the notion
of reduced amino acid availability due to the whole-body
resistance exercise bout. Thus, whereas we cannot defini-
tively state that the lower FSR values we observed in this
study are due to the dispersal of available amino acids to
a greater amount of muscle, it is an intuitively satisfying
explanation. Moreover, this notion is consistent with the
differential responses of MPS to the 20 and 40 g doses of
protein we report following whole-body, but not leg-only,
resistance exercise.
Although we believe the amount of muscle exercised is
the most likely explanation for the differences in results
observed between this study and previous studies (Moore
et al. 2009; Witard et al. 2014), alternative nonphysiologi-
cal explanations must be considered. One alternative
explanation may be related to sample size. The present
study results stem from n = 30 in a crossover design,
whereas previously we (Witard et al. 2014), and others
(Moore et al. 2009), recruited 12 and 6 participants (in
each group), respectively. However, since both previous
studies (Moore et al. 2009; Witard et al. 2014) observed a
mean difference of ~10% in MPS between the 20 and
40 g conditions and we detected a difference of ~20% in
the present study, there appears to be a real difference in
the response of MPS to whole-body resistance exercise
plus protein ingestion and leg-only exercise plus protein
ingestion.
Other possible explanations for the different results
between studies may relate to differences in the type of
protein ingested following exercise and the fraction of
muscle protein for which the muscle protein synthetic
rate was determined. However, the results of Moore et al.
(2009) and Witard et al. (2014) are similar despite these
methodological differences. Furthermore, our present and
previous (Witard et al. 2014) results differ despite similar
methodologies. Thus, the factor that differs between the
present study and previous studies (Moore et al. 2009;
Witard et al. 2014) is the amount of muscle activated
during the exercise bout. The postprandial time period
for measurement of MPS is another potential factor that
may explain the variable response to protein ingestion in
these studies. Both previous studies assessed MPS over
4 h
following
protein
ingestion
(Moore
et al.
2009;
Witard et al. 2014). We measured MPS for a total of 5 h
after protein ingestion. However, we also attempted to
determine more time resolution of the MPS response by
calculating FSR for two distinct time periods within the
overall 5 h. MPS was greater for the 40 g dose than
the 20 g dose for both time periods. Thus, it seems that
the differences in time of measurement between studies is
unlikely to explain the different responses to ingesting 40
and 20 g of whey protein that are reported. Therefore,
whereas we cannot definitively determine the exact cause
of the disparity in results between the present study and
the previous research, it may be due to the whole-body
exercise performed.
The dose of protein necessary for maximal stimulation
of MPS following resistance exercise often has been
thought to be greater for those individuals with greater

 LBM (Churchward-Venne et al. 2012b; Morton et al.
2015; Witard et al. 2016). However, our study is the first
to directly address whether the total amount of LBM
influences the MPS response to resistance exercise com-
bined with protein feeding. Whereas we did not observe
any influence of the amount of LBM on the MPS
response, we did observe that 40 g of protein stimulated
MPS to a greater extent than 20 g following whole-body
resistance exercise. Thus, it seems that the overall amount
of muscle mass possessed by the individual is a less
important determinant of the maximally effective dose of
protein to ingest than the amount of muscle mass acti-
vated during exercise. However, it is possible that LBM
may be an important determinant of the response of
MPS to a given amount of protein in other circum-
stances. For example, if leg-only exercise is performed,
perhaps MPS would not be similar between individuals
with higher and lower amounts of LBM in response to
ingestion of 20 and 40 g of protein. Our data suggest that
several factors other than the total amount of protein
ingested may influence the metabolic response of muscle
following exercise, that is, the physiological response of
muscle to varying amounts of ingested protein likely is
less simple than is often portrayed. More studies need to
be performed to examine these complexities.
The mTORC1 signaling pathway regulates MPS (Kim-
ball et al. 2002; Philp et al. 2011) and p70S6K1 activity
is one of the key readouts of activation of the pathway
(Hamilton et al. 2009). There were no differences in
p70S6K1 activity between the 20 and 40 g trials in the
present study, yet there was a significant difference in
MPS between protein doses. These results are consistent
with the findings of a previous study that observed no
increase in p70S6K1 phosphorylation at 4 h in response
to resistance exercise and increasing doses of egg protein
despite increased MPS at higher doses (Moore et al.
2009). However, in the present study p70S6K1 activity
was 1.6-fold greater at 180 min following protein inges-
tion in the LLBM compared with the HLBM group. We
believe that this difference in p70S6K1 activity was dri-
ven by the higher plasma leucine concentration in the
LLBM compared with the HLBM group with ingestion
of 40 g of whey protein. Leucine plays a unique role in
the regulation of mTORC1 signaling and MPS in combi-
nation with exercise (Anthony et al. 1999; Kimball and
Jefferson
2005,
2006;
Apro
and
Blomstrand
2010;
Moberg et al. 2014). However, this elevated activity was
not associated with a greater response of MPS in LLBM
compared to HLBM. Thus, in the context of both dose
and LBM groups there appears to be a discrepancy
between the response of p70S6K1 activity and MPS. This
apparent disconnect between signaling and MPS has
been noted in multiple studies previously (Dreyer et al.
2006; Mayhew et al. 2009; Witard et al. 2009; Atherton
et al. 2010; Churchward-Venne et al. 2012a). The dis-
crepancy could be due to the temporal pattern of the
response of mTORC1 signaling. It seems apparent that
the coupling of MPS with molecular signaling is most
certain only during the short temporal period around
peak signals (Atherton et al. 2010). Moore et al. (2011)
showed that whereas p70S6K1 phosphorylation was ele-
vated above baseline at 180 and 300 min following resis-
tance
exercise
and
protein
ingestion,
the
greatest
response was at 60 min. Consequently, it seems likely
that by measuring p70S6K1 activity at 180 and 300 min
following exercise and protein ingestion we may not
have measured the maximal response. Therefore, it is
perhaps not surprising that differences in p70S6K1 activ-
ity do not directly correspond with differences in MPS
in the present study.
In summary, our data show for the first time that
ingestion of 40 g whey protein results in greater stimula-
tion of MPS than 20 g whey protein following whole-
body resistance exercise in healthy, young males. Thus,
our data show for the first time that 20 g of protein does
not stimulate a maximal response of MPS in young,
trained men. These data may suggest that whole-body
resistance
exercise
alters
the
dynamics
of
the
MPS
response to protein feeding compared with exercising a
smaller amount of muscle, such as the case with lower-
limb exercise protocols (Moore et al. 2009; Witard et al.
2014). Whereas the total amount of muscle possessed by
the individual does not seem to influence the MPS
response in an individual muscle, the amount of muscle
that has been exercised seems to be important at doses of
40 g whey protein and below. We conclude that more
protein is necessary for the increased stimulation of MPS
following whole-body compared to unilateral or bilateral
resistance exercise. However, we must stress that our data
do not allow for a final explanation for the differences
between our study and previous studies. Future studies
should examine this issue directly. Thus, our results may
have implications for the design and implementation of
resistance

strategies to optimize muscle mass. At the very least, it
seems clear that ingesting 20 g of protein does not maxi-
mally stimulate MPS following resistance exercise in all
circumstances. Moreover, it is important to note that our
results are limited to healthy, young resistance-trained
individuals. Other populations with differing metabolic
responses
to
protein,
for
example,
older
individuals
(Moore et al. 2015), may respond differently. Moreover,
it is not possible to determine the dose of protein neces-
sary to stimulate a maximal MPS response from our data.
We examined the MPS response to two amounts of pro-
tein only. Further study is required to identify a maximal
