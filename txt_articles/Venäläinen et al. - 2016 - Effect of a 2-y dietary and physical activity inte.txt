ABSTRACT
Background: Evidence on the effects of lifestyle interventions on
plasma fatty acid composition in children is limited.
Objective: We investigated the effects of a dietary and physical
activity intervention on plasma fatty acid composition of cholesteryl
esters (CEs) and phospholipids and estimated desaturase and elongase
activities in children.
Design: We conducted a 2-y controlled dietary and physical activity
intervention based on Finnish nutrition and physical activity recom-
mendations in a population sample of 506 children aged 6–8 y. We
assessed plasma fatty acid composition by gas chromatography and
estimated desaturase and elongase activities as the ratio of product
fatty acids to precursor fatty acids. We analyzed data by using linear
mixed models adjusted for age and sex.
Results: The proportion of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
in CEs tended to increase in the intervention group compared with the
control group (P = 0.007 for group 3 time interaction). The propor-
tion of total PUFAs in phospholipids (P = 0.019 for group 3 time
interaction) and the proportion of linoleic acid in CEs (P = 0.038 for
group 3 time interaction) decreased in the control group. The pro-
portion of a-linolenic acid in CEs (P , 0.001 for group 3 time
interaction) increased and in phospholipids (P = 0.015 for group 3
time interaction) tended to increase in the intervention group. The
proportion of stearic acid in CEs decreased in the intervention group
(P = 0.001 for group 3 time interaction). The proportion of oleic acid
in CEs (P = 0.002 for group 3 time interaction) increased and in
phospholipids (P = 0.023 for group 3 time interaction) tended to
increase in the control group. Estimated elongase activity in CEs de-
creased in the control group (P = 0.050 for group 3 time interaction).
Intervention had no effect on estimated desaturase activities.
Conclusions: Dietary and physical activity intervention had a ben-
eficial effect on plasma fatty acid composition in children by
preventing the decrease in the proportion of total PUFAs and lino-
leic acid and by increasing the proportion of a-linolenic acid. This
study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01803776.

INTRODUCTION
Plasma fatty acid composition reflects the dietary intake
of saturated and polyunsaturated fat during the preceding weeks
(1–5) and is also influenced by several other factors such as adi-
posity, physical activity, and genetic factors (6–9). Plasma fatty
acid composition may predict the risk of developing type 2 dia-
betes and cardiovascular diseases in adults (10–13) and has also
been linked to increased cardiometabolic risk in children (14).
Eating a healthy diet and increasing physical activity starting
in childhood are key factors in the prevention of type 2 diabetes
and cardiovascular disease (15, 16). One of the reasons for the
beneficial effects of these lifestyle changes could be their in-
fluence on plasma fatty acid composition. A dietary intervention
beginning in infancy to decrease dietary saturated fatty acid and
cholesterol intake resulted in lower proportions of SFAs and
higher proportions of PUFAs in serum triglyceride fractions after
5 y of follow-up (17). Other studies on the effects of dietary
interventions on plasma fatty acid composition in children are
scarce. Moreover, evidence on the effects of physical activity or

 combined dietary and physical activity interventions on plasma
fatty acid composition among children is limited.
Increased stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD)9 and D6-desaturase
(D6D) activities and decreased D5-desaturase (D5D) activity in
plasma are associated with a weakened insulin sensitivity and an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adults (18, 19). Moreover,
high SCD and D6D activity, as well as low elongase activity in
plasma cholesteryl esters (CEs) and phospholipids, estimated by
the ratios of the proportions of individual fatty acids (20), are
linked to increased cardiometabolic risk already in childhood
(14). To our knowledge, there are no studies on the effects of
dietary and physical activity interventions on the desaturase and
elongase activities among children.
In many cases, it is still unclear whether associations found
between certain fatty acids and some disease risks indicate harmful
or beneficial effects of the fatty acids themselves or metabolic
changes affecting the concentration of these fatty acids. In addition,
the metabolism and fatty acid composition of plasma CE and phos-
pholipid fractions vary greatly, and there are also differences in
how the individual fatty acids reflect dietary intake or liver fatty
acid metabolism (14). Therefore, separate fatty acid analyses of
plasma CEs and phospholipids provide more information than the total
plasma fatty acid analysis in which, for example, changes in tri-
acylglycerol concentrations could mask the changes in other fractions.
We investigated the effects of a 2-y individualized and family-
based dietary and physical activity intervention on plasma fatty acid
composition, as well as estimated desaturase and elongase activities in
a population sample of children. We hypothesized that a lifestyle
intervention aimed at enhancing diet quality, increasing physical
activity, and decreasing sedentary behavior according to the Finnish
nutrition and physical activity recommendations increases the pro-
portion of PUFAs and decreases the proportion of MUFAs and SFAs
in plasma CEs and phospholipids among children.
METHODS
Study design and study population
The PANIC (Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children)
Study is a controlled dietary and physical activity intervention
study in a population sample of children from the city of Kuopio,
Finland (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01803776). The
study was primarily carried out at the Institute of Biomedicine at
the Kuopio campus of the University of Eastern Finland. Alto-
gether, 736 children 6–8 y of age who were registered for the
first grade in 16 primary schools of Kuopio were invited to
participate in the baseline study in 2007–2009 (Figure 1). In-
vitation letters were sent by mail to the principal custodians of
the children, who were asked to contact the research secretary
for participation. Of the 736 invited children, 512 (70%) par-
ticipated in the baseline study. Based on the comprehensive
school health examination data, the participants did not differ in
age, sex distribution, or BMI-SD score (SDS) from all children
who started the first grade in Kuopio during the years 2007–2009.
In total, 6 children were excluded from the intervention study
because of severe physical disability or withdrawal during
baseline examinations.
The 506 eligible children were then allocated to the inter-
vention group (306 children, 60%) or the control group (200 children,
40%) by matching them according to the location (urban com-
pared with rural) and size (large compared with small) of the
schools to minimize differences in baseline characteristics
between the groups. Dividing the children in the intervention or
control groups according to schools made it possible to organize
after-school exercise clubs conducted at schools only for the
intervention group and to avoid nonintentional intervention in the
control group. More children were included in the intervention
group than in the control group because of a larger number of
dropouts expected in the intervention group and to have sufficient
statistical power for comparison between the groups. Therefore
we ended up with 9 intervention schools with only intervention
subjects and 7 control schools with only control subjects.
Of the 506 children who participated in the baseline study, 440
(87%) attended the 2-y follow-up study (Figure 1). The median
(IQR) of the intervention period was 2.1 y (2.1–2.2 y) in both
groups. No interim measurements were taken during the 2-y
follow-up. Altogether, 45 (15%) children in the intervention
group and 21 (11%) children in the control group dropped out
during the 2-y follow-up. Data on plasma fatty acid composition
were available for 464 children (290 children in the intervention
group and 174 children in the control group) at baseline and for
386 children (236 children in the intervention group, 150 children
in the control group) at 2-y follow-up. The study protocol was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital
District of Northern Savo. Both the children and their parents
gave their written informed consent.
Dietary and physical activity intervention
The children and their parents allocated to the intervention
group had 6 dietary counseling sessions of 30–45 min and 6
physical activity counseling sessions of 30–45 min during the
2-y intervention period. The dietary and physical activity
counseling sessions occurred at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 mo
after baseline. Authorized clinical nutritionists and specialists in
exercise medicine of the PANIC study gave detailed and indi-
vidualized advice on how to enhance diet quality, increase
physical activity, and decrease sedentary behavior. The children
and their families also received fact sheets on diet quality,
physical activity, and sedentary behavior; verbal and written
information on opportunities to exercise in Kuopio; and some
financial support for physical activity, such as exercise equip-
ment and admission for indoor sports. The children were also
encouraged to participate in after-school exercise clubs orga-
nized by the PANIC study and supervised by trained exercise
instructors. In the exercise clubs, the children had the opportunity
to engage in different kinds of physical activities, such as indoor
ball games, cross-country skiing, and skating.
The goals of the intervention were 1) to decrease the con-
sumption of foods high in saturated fat, particularly high-fat
dairy and meat products; 2) to increase the consumption of foods
high in unsaturated fat, particularly high-fat vegetable oil–based
margarines, vegetable oils, and fish; 3) to increase the con-
sumption of vegetables, fruit, and berries; 4) to increase the
consumption of whole-grain products and other foods high in

 dietary fiber; 5) to decrease the consumption of foods high in
sugar, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages, sugar-sweetened
dairy products, and candies; 6) to decrease the consumption of
foods high in salt and the use of salt in cooking; 7) to avoid
excessive energy intake; 8) to increase total physical activity by
emphasizing its diversity; and 9) to decrease total and particu-
larly screen-based sedentary behavior. These goals were based
on the Finnish Nutrition Recommendations (21) and the Finnish
Recommendations for Physical Activity of School-aged Chil-
dren (22). The children and their parents in the control group
received verbal and written advice on a health-improving diet and
physical activity according to the Finnish recommendations (21, 22)
at baseline but no active intervention.
Assessment of body size and composition
Body height and weight were assessed by trained research
personnel. Body height was measured to accuracy of 0.1 cm by
a wall-mounted stadiometer in the Frankfurt plane without shoes.
Body weight was measured to accuracy of 0.1 kg after overnight
fasting, with an empty bladder, and standing in light underwear
by use of a calibrated InBody 720 device (Biospace). BMI was
calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by body height (m) squared.
BMI-SDS was calculated by use of Finnish references (23).
Assessment of plasma fatty acid composition and
calculation of estimated desaturase and elongase activities
Blood sampling was conducted after a 12-h overnight fast.
Plasma fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chroma-
tography, as described previously (5, 24). Plasma samples were
extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1), and the lipid fractions
were separated by solid-phase extraction with an aminopropyl
column. Fatty acids in plasma CEs and phospholipids were
transmethylated with 14% boron trifluoride in methanol and were
analyzed by the 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technol-
ogies Inc.) equipped with a 25-m FFAP column. Cholesteryl
nonadecanoate (Nu Chek Prep Inc.), trinonadecanoin, and

 phosphatidylcholine dinonadecanoyl (Larodan Fine Chemicals)
served as internal standards. The relative amount of fatty acids
was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of fatty acids
reported (25). The amounts of some fatty acids present in
plasma phospholipids were under the detection limit in plasma
CEs.
The desaturase and elongase activities in plasma CEs and
phospholipids were estimated as the ratio of the single product fatty
acid divided by the single precursor fatty acid. In terms of fatty acids
in CEs, the formulas were set as follows: SCD is 16:1n–7/16:0, D6D
is 18:3n–6/18:2n–6, and D5D is 20:4n–6/20:3n–6 (26). In terms
of phospholipids, the same ratios were used except for the D6D
that equaled 20:3n–6/18:2n–6 (26). The proportion of dihomo-
g-linolenic acid was used in phospholipids because the proportion
of g-linolenic acid was too low for detect in phospholipids, and
this ratio is a valid estimate for activity of D6D (26). The ratio
for estimation of the elongase activity both in CEs and phos-
pholipids was 18:1n–7/16:1n–7 (27).
Sample size calculations
The original power calculations were performed according
to the primary outcomes of the PANIC Study, which were
BMI-SDS, waist circumference, fasting serum insulin, fasting
plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, fasting plasma triglycerides, HDL
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure, and the cardiometabolic risk score. The plasma fatty com-
positions of CEs and phospholipids were secondary outcomes.
We determined the number of children required at 2-y follow-up
to detect a $0.30-SD difference in the primary outcomes be-
tween the intervention group (60% of children) and the control
group (40% of children) with a power of 80% and a 2-sided P
value for the difference between the groups of 0.05, allowing
for a 20% loss to follow-up or missing data. According to these
power calculations, we would need a sample size of $275
children in the intervention group and $183 children in the
control group at baseline and $220 children in the interven-
tion group and $147 children in the control group at 2-y follow-
up for the whole PANIC study. In this secondary outcome
study, the fatty acid data were available for 236 children in
the intervention group and 150 children in the control group at
2-y follow-up, which is in the range of our original power
calculation.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were performed by using the IBM SPSS
Statistics, version 21 (IBM Corp.). Differences in basic char-
acteristics between the intervention group and the control group
at baseline were tested by the t test for independent samples
except for the difference in sex distribution that was tested by
the x2 test. The effects of the 2-y intervention on plasma fatty
acid composition were analyzed by use of the linear mixed
models. Study group (intervention group, control group), time
(baseline, 2-y follow-up), and group 3 time interaction were
included as fixed factors in the model. Participant and school
were included as random effects in the model to account for in-
traparticipant and intraschool correlations between the repeated
measures for each participant. The interaction between study group
and time was analyzed after adjustment for age and sex. We also
made further adjustments for BMI-SDS. Therefore, the linear
mixed models we used were as follows: (study group, time, age,
sex, group 3 time interaction) and (study group, time, age,
sex, BMI-SDS, group 3 time interaction). Differences and in-
teractions with 2-sided P values ,0.05 were considered statis-
tically significant.
RESULTS
Baseline and 2-y follow-up characteristics
The basic characteristics of the children at baseline and 2-y
follow-up are presented in Table 1. Children in the intervention
group were 129.0 cm tall and weighed 27.0 kg, and the BMI-SDS
was 20.16 at baseline, whereas at 2-y follow-up they were 140.8 cm
tall and weighed 34.4 kg, and the BMI-SDS was 20.14. There
were no differences in sex distribution, age, body weight, body
height, or BMI-SDS between the intervention group and the
control group at baseline (data not shown). During the 2-y follow-up,
15% of the intervention group and 10% of the control group
dropped out (Figure 1).
Effect of intervention on fatty acid composition of plasma
cholesteryl esters
The proportion of stearic acid decreased in the intervention
group but not in the control group after adjustment for age and sex
(P = 0.001 for group 3 time interaction; Table 2). The pro-
portion of total MUFAs did not change significantly in the in-
tervention group but increased in the control group (P = 0.007
for group 3 time interaction). The proportion of oleic acid
tended to decrease in the intervention group but increased in the
control group (P = 0.002 for group 3 time interaction). The
proportion of total PUFAs tended to increase in the intervention
group but decreased in the control group (P = 0.007 for group 3
time interaction). The proportion of linoleic acid did not change
significantly in the intervention group but decreased in the
control group (P = 0.038 for group 3 time interaction). The
proportion of a-linolenic acid increased in the intervention
group but decreased in the control group (P , 0.001 for group 3
time interaction). Estimated elongase activity did not change
significantly in the intervention group but decreased in the
control group (P = 0.050 for group 3 time interaction). The
intervention had no effects on estimated desaturase activities in
plasma CEs. Additional adjustment for BMI-SDS did not alter
the results, except that it weakened the effect of intervention on
the proportion of linoleic acid (P = 0.054 for group 3 time
interaction) (data not shown).
Effect of intervention on fatty acid composition of plasma
phospholipids
The proportion of total MUFAs tended to decrease in the
intervention group but did not change significantly in the control
group after adjustment for age and sex (P = 0.021 for group 3
time interaction; Table 3). The proportion of oleic acid did not
change significantly in the intervention group but tended to in-
crease in the control group (P = 0.023 for group 3 time inter-
action). The proportion of total PUFA did not change
significantly in the intervention group but decreased in the

 control group (P = 0.019 for group 3 time interaction). The
proportion of a-linolenic acid tended to increase in the interven-
tion group but tended to decrease in the control group (P = 0.015
for group 3 time interaction). The proportion of docosapentaenoic
acid did not change significantly in the intervention group but
decreased in the control group (P = 0.003 for group 3 time in-
teraction). The intervention had no effects on estimated desaturase
or elongase activities in plasma phospholipids. Further adjustment
for BMI-SDS had no effect on the results regarding the fatty acid
composition of phospholipids.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the effects of
combined dietary and physical activity intervention on plasma
fatty acid composition in children. The results from the present
study demonstrate that a 2-y individualized and family-based
dietary and physical activity intervention in school-aged children
attenuated the decrease in PUFAs and the increase in MUFAs in
plasma CEs and phospholipids relative to the control group. The
proportion of a-linolenic acid increased, and the proportion of
oleic acid decreased in the intervention group compared with
the control group. Moreover, the proportion of stearic acid in
plasma CEs decreased in the intervention group relative to the
control group.
We found a decrease in the proportion of oleic acid and an
increase in the proportion of a-linolenic acid in CEs in the in-
tervention group compared with the control group. In addition,
the proportion of linoleic acid decreased in the control group.
These findings may be caused by the substantial increase in the
consumption of vegetable oil–based margarine (fat 60–80%) and
increase in the intake of PUFAs in the intervention group, as
previously reported (28). We have reported earlier that the
consumption of vegetable oil–based margarine is inversely as-
sociated with all plasma SFAs and MUFAs and directly asso-
ciated with the proportion of linoleic and a-linolenic acid in CEs
at baseline (5). These results and our previous findings together
may result in the higher intake of linoleic acid and a-linolenic
acid in the intervention group and may explain the differences
in their proportions in CEs. However, because the margarines
in Finland are rich in rapeseed oil, the intake of MUFAs also
increased in the intervention group (28), and yet the propor-
tion of MUFAs and oleic acid was found to decrease in CEs and
phospholipids compared with the control group. This could
be a consequence of more efficient incorporation of linoleic
acid and a-linolenic acid into plasma lipid fractions replacing
MUFAs. However, it is also possible that higher intake of
PUFAs had a beneficial effect on liver fatty acid metabolism
because PUFAs have been shown to reduce liver fat content, de
novo lipogenesis, and SCD activity (29, 30). The pattern with
increased proportion of oleic acid and decreased proportions of
linoleic acid and a-linoleic acid seen in the control group may
suggest increased de novo lipogenesis and SCD activity, whereas
this development may have been prevented by the better diet
quality in the intervention group. This view is also sup-
ported, despite the lack of significant interaction between
group and time, by the increased proportion of palmitoleic acid
and increased estimated SCD activity in CEs in the control
group.
We also found that the proportion of stearic acid in CEs de-
creased among children in the intervention group but not in the
control group. In a previous study with adults, a decrease in the
proportion of stearic acid in plasma CEs was reported during
a 6-wk Healthy Nordic Diet intervention (31). We have previ-
ously shown that the intervention slightly decreased the con-
sumption of butter-based spreads (28), which may contribute to
this finding. However, the intake of butter and butter-oil mixture
was not associated with stearic acid in CEs at baseline (5). In
addition, a dietary intervention to decrease dietary SFA and
cholesterol intake resulted in a lower proportion of palmitic acid
in serum triglycerides but a higher proportion of stearic acid in
serum CEs among children 5 y of age (17). Therefore the more
probable explanation for the decreased proportion of stearic acid
in CEs is, as in the case of oleic acid, the increased consumption
of vegetable oil-based margarine in the intervention group. In line
with this, a decrease in the proportion of stearic acid in CEs but
not in PLs has been found after a rapeseed oil diet (26).
The results of the present study showed no effect of lifestyle
intervention on the estimated desaturase activities in children.
This is in accordance with an exercise and dietary counseling
study among adults showing no changes in desaturase estimates
after 1 y (18). Previous short-term dietary intervention studies
have resulted in a decrease in the estimated SCD activity and an
increase in estimated D5D activity (26, 31) and also a decrease
in estimated D6D activity (26). This difference might be explained
by the greater modification of dietary fatty acid composition

 in these studies. However, it is also possible that rapid sub-
stantial changes in the intake of fatty acids used in the calcula-
tion of estimates, for example palmitoleic acid and linoleic
acid, may affect their amounts in plasma and thus desaturase
estimates without or in addition to actual change in enzyme
activity.
We found decreased estimated elongase activity in CEs in the
control group. Because this estimate was calculated from the ratio
of cis-vaccenic acid to palmitoleic acid, it may represent the
activity of elongase 5 or 6 or both (32). The proportion of
docosapentaenoic acid in phospholipids decreased in the control
group, which may also indicate decreased elongase 5 activity. A
high proportion of palmitoleic acid and low elongase activity
estimates in erythrocyte membranes have been associated with
worsening of hyperglycemia (27) and also with higher plasma
concentration of C-reactive protein (33), which indicates that
low elongase activity and accumulation of palmitoleic acid may
be biomarkers for unfavorable metabolic changes.
To our knowledge, there are no previous intervention studies
about the effects of physical activity on plasma fatty acid compo-
sition in children, and there are only a few such studies in adults
(7, 8). Aerobic training has been reported to increase the pro-
portion of oleic acid and to decrease the proportion of arachidonic
acid in muscle phospholipids and the proportion of di-homo-g-
linolenic acid in serum CEs but not in muscle triglycerides or other
fatty acids in serum phospholipids or CEs compared with the
control group (34). Nevertheless, enhancing dietary fat quality is
a more important way of improving plasma fatty acid composi-
tion than physical activity.
The strengths of our study are a relatively large population
sample of children and a carefully conducted, individualized, and
family-based dietary and physical activity intervention with a long
follow-up and detailed fatty acid analysis. Because the sensitivity
of individual fatty acid to dietary or metabolic changes may be
different in plasma CEs and phospholipids, separate analyses can
reveal changes not seen in all fractions or whole plasma. A
weakness of the study is that we did not randomly allocate the
children in the intervention and control group. However, we
divided the children into groups by matching them according to
the location and size of the schools. This allowed us to organize
after-school exercise clubs at schools that minimized the non-
intentional intervention in the control group. This is why we
controlled for the possible random effect of the schools in the
mixed-model analyses. Another weakness is that we were not
able to assess the true enzyme activities, because liver biopsy
would be needed for that purpose (19). We used ratios calculated
from the proportions of individual fatty acids for the estimation of
desaturase and elongase activities in plasma lipid fractions. This
approach has been widely used (35, 36).
In conclusion, the 2-y individualized and family-based life-
style intervention aimed at enhancing overall diet quality, in-
creasing physical activity, and decreasing sedentary behavior
prevented the decrease in the proportion of total PUFAs and
linoleic acid, as well as increased the proportion of a-linolenic
acid relative to the control group. These findings on the bene-
ficial effects of dietary and physical activity intervention on
plasma fatty acid composition in children may be useful in
developing lifestyle counseling strategies to prevent metabolic
syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases since
childhood.
