Auto-antibodies against the paranodal proteins neurofascin-155 and contactin-1 have recently been described in patients with
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and are associated with a distinct clinical phenotype and response to
treatment. Contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr, encoded by CNTNAP1) is a paranodal protein that is attached to neurofascin-
155 and contactin-1 (CNTN1) but has not yet been identified as a sole antigen in patients with inflammatory neuropathies. In the
present study, we screened a cohort of 35 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (age range
20–80, 10 female, 25 male) and 22 patients with Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (age range 17–86, eight female, 14 male) for auto-
antibodies against paranodal antigens. We identified two patients, one with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculo-
neuropathy and one with Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome, with autoantibodies against Caspr by binding assays using Caspr transfected
human embryonic kidney cells and murine teased fibres. IgG3 was the predominant autoantibody subclass in the patient with
Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome, IgG4 was predominant in the patient with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.
Accordingly, complement deposition after binding to HEK293 cells was detectable in the patient with IgG3 autoantibodies only,
not in the patient with IgG4. Severe disruption of the paranodal and nodal architecture was detectable in teased fibres of the sural
nerve biopsy and in dermal myelinated fibres, supporting the notion of the paranodes being the site of pathology. Deposition of
IgG at the paranodes was detected in teased fibre preparations of the sural nerve, further supporting the pathogenicity of anti-
Caspr autoantibodies. Pain was one of the predominant findings in both patients, possibly reflected by binding of patients’ IgG to
TRPV1 immunoreactive dorsal root ganglia neurons. Our results demonstrate that the paranodal protein Caspr constitutes a new
antigen that leads to autoantibody generation as part of the novel entity of neuropathies associated with autoantibodies against
paranodal proteins.

 Introduction
The nodes of Ranvier are essential for saltatory nerve con-
duction along myelinated nerve fibres and are divided into
the nodal, paranodal and juxtaparanodal compartments,
which consist of different adhesion
proteins and ion
channels (Dupree et al., 1999). At the paranodes, the pro-
tein complex consisting of neurofascin-155, contactin-1
(encoded by CNTN1) and Caspr (encoded by CNTNAP1)
forms a link between myelin sheath and axon (Susuki et al.,
2008). Recent studies have shown that this paranodal com-
plex is a target for autoantibodies against the proteins con-
tactin-1,
neurofascin-155
and
the
contactin-1/Caspr
complex in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinat-
ing polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) (Devaux et al., 2012;
Ng et al., 2012; Querol et al., 2013; Doppler et al.,
2015b; Miura et al., 2015). Antibodies against neurofas-
cin-155 and contactin-1 are associated with a distinct clin-
ical
picture
of
severe
acute-onset
motor
and
sensory
neuropathy, and often with tremor or ataxia (Querol
et al., 2014; Doppler et al., 2015b; Miura et al., 2015).
Although neuropathies with these paranodal antibodies
have only been detected in a small percentage of patients
with inflammatory neuropathies, they are of diagnostic
interest, as there is evidence that these patients may respond
less well to the standard therapy of CIDP (Querol et al.,
2014, 2015; Doppler et al., 2015b). So far, information on
this rare condition is limited, as only a few patients have
been identified and reported. In the present study, we pro-
spectively screened serum from a cohort of patients with
inflammatory neuropathies for binding to murine teased
fibres and thereby identified the paranodal protein Caspr
as a new antigen for autoantibodies against the paranodal
complex.
Materials and methods
Patients
Patients with a diagnosis of CIDP fulfilling the Inflammatory
Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) criteria (Hughes
et al., 2008) or Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (GBS) according to
the Brighton criteria (Sejvar et al., 2011) who attended the
University Hospitals Wu
¨rzburg or Gießen between January
2014 and November 2015, were prospectively recruited. The
resulting cohort comprised 35 patients with CIDP (age range
20–80, 10 female, 25 male) and 10 patients with GBS (age
range 17–86, 8 female, 14 male). To increase the number of
GBS samples, plasma exchange material of 12 patients with
GBS
that was
stored
in the
Department
of
Neurology,
University Hospital Wu
¨rzburg, was retrospectively included.
Healthy controls and disease controls (patients with multiple
sclerosis or myasthenia gravis) for binding assays with Caspr-
transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and
murine teased fibres were taken from serum samples recruited
for a former study that were stored in our department
(Doppler et al., 2015a, b). The study and the use of sera
from
the
previous
study
were
approved
by
the
Ethics
Committees of the Medical Faculties of the Universities of
Wu
¨rzburg and Gießen, and all patients gave informed and
written consent to participate.
Binding assays with murine teased
fibres
Murine sciatic nerves and ventral and dorsal roots were obtained
from adult C57BL/6 mice, and teased fibre preparations and
binding assays with human sera and plasma exchange material
were performed as previously described (Doppler et al., 2015a,
b). Briefly, teased fibre preparations were incubated with patients’
sera diluted 1:100 overnight at 4�C following incubation with
appropriate anti-human IgG Cy3-conjugated secondary antibo-
dies (Dianova, 1:100) for 1h at room temperature. Double im-
munofluorescence staining using polyclonal rabbit anti-Caspr
(Abcam, 1:1000) and corresponding anti-rabbit IgG Cy3-conju-
gated and anti-human IgG Cy2-conjungated secondary antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100) was performed to detect co-
localization of sera and the paranodal complex. Slides were as-
sessed using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Ax10, Zeiss).
ELISA for autoantibodies against
contactin-1 and neurofascin-155
ELISA for anti-contactin-1 and anti-neurofascin-155 was per-
formed as previously described (Ng et al., 2012; Doppler et al.,
2015a).
Briefly,
Maxisorb
96-well-plates
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific) were coated with human full-length contactin-1
(Sino Biological) or neurofascin-155 (kindly provided by J.
K. Ng and E. Meinl; Ng et al., 2012). All wells were incubated
with either patients’ samples (1:100), anti-contactin-1 (mouse
monoclonal, Abcam, 1:200) or anti-neurofascin antibodies
(chicken polyclonal, R&D, 1:5000). Plates were then incu-
bated with appropriate horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies (anti-human-IgG for patients’ material,
1:10 000, Dako; anti-mouse IgG/-chicken IgY for the control
antibody, anti-mouse: Dako, 1:500, anti-chicken: Thermo
Fisher Scientific, 1:10 000). TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) solu-
tion (eBioscience) was added to each well and the reaction was
stopped after 15 min by the addition of 50 ml of 1 M sulphuric
acid.
Optical
density
was
measured
at
450 nm
with
a
Multiskan EX Elisa Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
normal value was set at 5 standard deviations (SD) above
the mean of 60 healthy controls, based on the distribution of
values obtained from normal controls and anti-contactin-1-
positive/anti-neurofascin-positive
CIDP
patients
from
a
former study (Doppler et al., 2015a,b).
Binding assays with transfected
HEK293 cells and flow cytometry
HEK293 cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated cover
slips in a 24-well-plate at a density of 50 000 cells/well and
were transiently transfected with plasmids of human Caspr
(Peles et al., 1997) or human contactin-1 as a control (Peles
et al., 1995) using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method
(0.25 mg of DNA/well) as previously described (Doppler et al.,
2015a, b). A transfection rate of about 20% was achieved.

 Binding assays were performed 48 h after transfection by incu-
bating the cells for 1 h with the serum samples of the two
patients who showed paranodal binding to murine teased
fibres (1:500) and then fixing them with 4% paraformalde-
hyde. The cells were then incubated with Cy3-conjugated
anti-human
IgG
as
a
secondary
antibody.
Immunofluorescence staining with mouse monoclonal anti-
contactin-1 (Abcam, 1:200) or anti-Caspr (UC Davis/NIH
NeuroMab Facility, 1:200) with corresponding Cy3-conjun-
gated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies was performed as
a control. For the identification of IgG subclasses, FITC-con-
jugated anti-human IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 (Abcam, 1:200) or
anti-human IgG3 (Sigma Aldrich, 1:200) were used as second-
ary
antibodies.
Coverslips
were
mounted
using
Mowiol
(Calbiochem) with DAPI. Immunostaining was assessed using
a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Ax10). The examiners (L.A.,
K.D.) were blinded to the diagnosis of the patients and con-
trols. For flow cytometry, cells were co-transfected with plas-
mids of Caspr and contactin-1, as it is known that contactin-1
is required for cell surface expression of Caspr (Faivre-Sarrailh
et
al.,
2000).
Cells
were
detached
with
Accutase
�
(GE
Healthcare), rinsed, suspended in flow cytometry buffer con-
taining 1% bovine serum albumin and subsequently incubated
with sera of either patients or healthy controls (1:50) or a
polyclonal rabbit anti-Caspr-antibody (Abcam, 1:50) as a posi-
tive control. After a washing step, the corresponding secondary
Cy2-conjugated anti-human IgG or Alexa Fluor
� 488-conju-
gated
anti-rabbit
IgG
antibodies
were
added
(Jackson
ImmunoResearch,
1:50/Thermo
Fisher
Scientific,
1:50).
Fluorescence data were acquired on a FACSCalibur
TM flow
cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Bioscience).
Pre-absorption experiments
Pre-absorption was performed by serial incubation of patients’
samples (1:500 and 1:1000) 1 h each in three wells with Caspr-
transfected HEK293 cells. Sera incubated in wells with contac-
tin-1-transfected cells served as controls. Then, the samples
were incubated with murine teased fibres, dorsal root ganglion
(DRG) sections and cultured DRG neurons and labelled with
anti-human IgG as described above.
Binding assays with cultured
hippocampal neurons, motor neurons
and dorsal root ganglia neurons
Hippocampi were dissected from C57BL/6 embryonic Day 18
mouse embryos, were transferred to pre-warmed trypsin-
EDTA and were digested for 5 min. Neurobasal
� medium
was added and the hippocampi were triturated gently with a
fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were plated on poly-D-
lysine coated cover slips at a density of 25 000 cells per plate
and were grown for 7–14 days. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and were incubated with patients’ samples
(1:1000) and Cy3-conjugated anti-human IgG as a secondary
antibody (Dianova, 1:100). For the dissection of DRG neu-
rons, C57BL/6 wild-type mice aged 6–12 weeks were used.
Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and cervical
dislocation. DRG neurons were extracted from all parts of
the spinal cord and treated with Liberase Blendzyme 4 (TH;
5U/500 ml, Sigma Aldrich) and Liberase
TM Blendzyme 3 (1 U/
100 ml, Sigma-Aldrich) as described (Dib-Hajj et al., 2009).
DRGs were kept and grown in 89% Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium/F12 high glucose. DRG neurons were plated
at a density of 7 � 103 cells on glass cover slips coated with
poly-L-lysine (20 mg/ml). Fixation and staining of the cells was
performed 7 to 14 days after isolation. Mixed motor neuron
cultures were prepared from spinal cord of embryonic Day 13
mouse embryos. Spinal cord pieces were digested with trypsin
for 30 min at 37�C in a water bath. Trypsinization was
stopped with foetal calf serum. Following trypsin digestion,
the cell solution was supplied with Neurobasal
� medium and
triturated. The supernatant was supplied to a fresh tube and
the cell debris again triturated. Both supernatants were com-
bined and centrifuged for 20 min at 600 g. The cell pellet was
resuspended in Neurobasal
� medium containing L-glutamine
and B27. Cells were counted and plated with a density of
300 000 cells /3 cm dish containing 4 polylysine-coated cover
slips. Cells were grown for 4 weeks to reach full neuronal
differentiation.
Binding assays with cerebellum,
spinal cord, cortex and dorsal
root ganglion sections
Cerebellum, spinal cord, cerebral cortex and DRG were pre-
pared
from
adult
Lewis
rats
and
were
cryoconserved.
Cryosections were cut and incubated with patients’ and con-
trol samples at a dilution of 1:100 and 1:500 each. Anti-
human IgG (Dako) was used as a secondary antibody and
was visualized with diaminobenzidine.
For double labelling of DRG, sections were incubated with
patients’ IgG and anti-TRPV1 (Alomone labs, 1:100) and
biotin-conjugated IB4 (Sigma Aldrich, 1:500) as well as appro-
priate secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor
� 488-conjugated anti-
human IgG, Dianova, 1:100, FITC-conjugated extravidin, Sigma,
1:200) and were assessed using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss
Ax10). Again, the examiner (K.D.) was blinded to the diagnosis.
Immunohistochemistry of skin
biopsies and human teased fibres
Punch skin biopsies of the lateral index finger, proximal and
distal leg of Patient 1 were taken as previously described
(Doppler et al., 2013). Double immunofluorescence with
anti-MBP
(GeneTex,
1:200),
anti-Caspr
(Abcam,
1:100),
anti-pan-neurofascin (recognizing both isoforms, neurofascin-
155 and -186, Abcam, 1:400) and anti-pan-sodium-channel
(Sigma Aldrich, 1:100) was performed as previously described
(Doppler et al., 2013). Intraepidermal nerve fibre density was
determined by immunofluorescence labelling with anti-PGP9.5
(Ultraclone, 1:1000) and counting of nerve fibres crossing the
dermal-intraepidermal junction according to published count-
ing rules (Lauria et al., 2010). Sural nerve biopsy was per-
formed according to standard procedures in Patient 1 (Dyck,
2005). One-quarter of the nerve biopsy was used for teased
fibre preparations that were performed and immunolabelled
according to the same protocol as used for murine teased
fibres (Doppler et al., 2015a, b). Double immunofluorescence
staining was done with anti-MBP (GeneTex, 1:500) and
anti-Caspr
(Abcam,
1:100),
anti-pan-neurofascin
(Abcam,

 1:400) and anti-pan-sodium-channel (Sigma Aldrich, 1:100).
For the detection of binding of IgG at the paranodes, teased
fibres were incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-human IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100) or FITC-conjugated anti-
human IgG1-4 antibodies (IgG1, 2 and 4: Abcam, IgG3:
Sigma Aldrich; 1:200) for 1 h. All immunofluorescence stains
were evaluated using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio).
Complement binding assay with C1q
Caspr-transfected HEK293 cells were washed with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 1h at 37�C and
constant agitation with patients’ samples diluted 1:500 in 2%
BSA/PBS. After three washing steps with PBS, human C1q
(Sigma Aldrich, 200 mg/ml) was added and was incubated for
2h at 37�C and constant agitation. After further washing and
fixation with 4% PFA, FITC-conjugated anti-C1q (Abcam,
1:200) was used as a secondary antibody to detect deposition
of C1q, performing double immunofluorescence with anti-human
IgG Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova, 1:200).
Results
Detection of autoantibodies against
Caspr
Characteristic binding to the paranodes of murine teased
fibres co-localizing with the immunofluorescence signal of
anti-Caspr was observed in two patients, one with CIDP
and one with GBS (Table 1 and Fig. 1A–I). No autoanti-
bodies against neurofascin-155 or contactin-1 were detect-
able in these samples by ELISA. Both sera tested negative
for autoantibodies against gangliosides GM1 IgM/IgG,
GM2
IgM/IgG,
GD1b
IgM/IgG
and
GQ1b
IgM/IgG
(Euroimmun). Binding assays of the sera of both patients
with Caspr-transfected HEK293 cells showed strong bind-
ing to transfected cells. No binding to Caspr-transfected
HEK293 cells was found after incubation with the sera of
25 normal controls and 10 disease controls with other
neurological autoimmune disorders. We did not detect
any binding to cells transfected with contactin-1 (Fig. 2E
and F). Binding of sera to Caspr-transfected HEK293 cells
was assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A–F) and
was further quantified by flow cytometry (Fig. 2G–I).
To confirm the specificity of the autoantibodies against
Caspr, the samples of both patients were preincubated with
Caspr and contactin-1 transfected HEK293 cells. Paranodal
staining of teased fibres was lost after preincubation with
Caspr, but not with contactin-1 (Fig. 1J–M), confirming the
existence of autoantibodies specifically directed against Caspr
in 1/35 patients with CIDP and 1/22 patients with GBS.
Using
secondary
antibodies
directed
against
human
IgG1–4, both in the teased fibres assay and the HEK293
cell assay, IgG4 was identified as the most prevalent sub-
class in Patient 1. No relevant immunoreactivity was found
for IgG2 and IgG3 and only weak reactivity for IgG1. In
Patient 2, IgG3 was the most prevalent subclass and no
immunoreactivity of IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 was detectable
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Clinical features of patients with
anti-Caspr autoantibodies
Patient 1 was a 30-year-old male who developed sensory
deficits and severe pain in the back and feet in January
2013, 2 weeks after a common cold. Pareses followed
shortly after, symptoms were rapidly progressive, and the
patient was unable to walk within a few months (Table
2). There were no autonomic symptoms. The patient suf-
fered from severe neuropathic pain in the hands and feet
that required treatment with high doses of tilidine and preg-
abalin (Table 2). CSF revealed a slightly increased cell count
and high protein level (Table 2). Nerve conduction studies
showed features of a demyelinating neuropathy including
decreased
nerve
conduction
velocity,
prolonged
distal
motor latency and F waves and preserved compound
muscle and sensory nerve action potentials at the onset of
disease. No compound motor nerve action potentials were
recordable 1 year after onset except for the right median
nerve. EMG revealed fibrillations and positive sharp waves
in distal more than in proximal muscles. An MRI scan of the
lumbosacral plexus showed increased signal intensity in the
spinal roots and the sciatic nerves of both sides. Symptoms
were continuously progressive until the patient was mostly
wheel-chair bound and was only able to walk a few steps
with crutches. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins
was ineffective. Methylprednisolone (1g/day for 5 days) led
to a slight improvement for only a few weeks. Plasma ex-
change was started in 2014 and resulted in stabilization of
the patient’s condition for several weeks. Treatment with
rituximab was initiated in July 2014. The patient showed
marked
improvement
after
treatment
with
rituximab
(2 � 1000mg initially and 1 � 1000 mg after 6 months).
Pareses as well as sensory deficits ameliorated over a
period of 20 months. The patient was finally able to walk
without aid. Furthermore, nerve conduction studies con-
firmed a partial recovery of the peripheral nerves. Binding
to murine teased fibres had disappeared in an assay per-
formed 5 months after the first treatment with rituximab.
At this time, binding to transfected HEK293 cells was
weak as confirmed by flow cytometry, and 6 months after
treatment it was no more detectable (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Patient 2 was a 69-year-old female who developed pain
in the back and legs and distal numbness followed by par-
eses of the hands and legs in 2011, 10 days after a respira-
tory infection. Pareses and sensory deficits increased over 3
weeks. There were no autonomic symptoms, but severe
neuropathic pain in the arms and legs that was treated
with up to 200 mg of pregabalin per day. Nerve conduction
studies showed reduced compound muscle action potentials
but normal nerve conduction velocities during the first
week of disease. One week later, nerve conduction studies
revealed prolonged F wave and distal motor latencies,

 reduced compound muscle action potential, a conduction
block in the tibial nerve and slightly reduced nerve conduc-
tion velocities, but no temporal dispersion, fulfilling the
electrophysiological diagnostic criteria of acute inflamma-
tory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (Hadden et al.,
1998). No spontaneous activity was recordable on EMG at
any time. The patient was diagnosed with GBS and treated
with five plasma exchanges. Recovery started 4 weeks after
onset. The course of disease was monophasic. At a follow-
up visit in our department 1 year after the diagnosis of
GBS, the patient did not present any neurological deficits
or pain. Nerve conduction studies were nearly normal, the
conduction block of the tibial nerve was no longer present
(Supplementary Fig. 3). A follow-up serum sample was ob-
tained in April 2016 and did not show any binding to
murine teased fibres or Caspr-transfected HEK293 cells as
assessed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.
Destruction of paranodal/nodal
architecture in the sural nerve biopsy
and skin biopsies
Sural nerve biopsy of Patient 1 and skin biopsies of the
distal and proximal leg and finger were obtained in 2014
for diagnostic work-up. No sensory nerve action potential
was measurable in the sural nerve at this time-point. Sural
nerve biopsy revealed subperineurial oedema, severe axonal
loss, numerous degenerating axons, but only a few thinly
myelinated fibres and no onion bulbs; thus showing fea-
tures of axonal damage but no features of de- or remyeli-
nation (Supplementary Fig. 4). The number of endoneurial
T cells was only mildly increased. Skin biopsies revealed a
normal intraepidermal nerve fibre density of 12.2 fibres/mm
at the distal leg and 16.9 fibres/mm at the proximal leg.
Paranodal and nodal architecture was studied using teased
fibres of the sural nerve biopsy and skin biopsy sections
from the lateral index finger. We found severe dispersion
of Caspr and neurofascin staining in teased fibres of the
sural nerve and dermal myelinated fibres (Fig. 4A, C and
D), similar to the findings in skin biopsies of patients with
anti-contactin-1 autoantibodies (Doppler et al., 2015b).
Numerous elongated nodes of Ranvier were detectable,
but dispersion of Caspr and neurofascin staining was also
found at nodes of normal length (Fig. 4D). Remarkably,
morphological changes were not restricted to paranodal
proteins.
Immunofluorescence

anti-pan-
sodium

of

band
of
sodium channels at many nodes (Fig. 4B).

 Patient 1 to demonstrate binding of patient’s IgG to the
paranodes in vivo. Indeed, paranodes were immunoreactive
for human IgG in the sural nerve biopsy of Patient 1, but
not in a nerve biopsy of a patient with non-inflammatory
peripheral neuropathy that served as control (Fig. 5).
Binding to paranodes of motor
and sensory nerve fibres and
non-paranodal tissue
As motor symptoms were more severe than sensory deficits
in both patients, binding to motor nerve fibres (ventral
roots) and sensory nerve fibres (dorsal roots) was assessed
in comparison. Strong binding to the paranodes of fibres of
the ventral root was detected, but only weak binding to the
paranodes of dorsal roots (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Binding to neuronal structures such as cerebellum, hippo-
campal neurons or DRGs has been described in sera with
autoantibodies against other paranodal proteins, namely
contactin-1 and neurofascin-155 (Querol et al., 2013,
2014; Doppler et al., 2015b; Miura et al., 2015). We there-
fore investigated binding of the samples of our patients
with anti-Caspr autoantibodies to cerebellum, spinal cord,
cerebrum, hippocampal neurons, motor neurons and DRG
(sections and cultured neurons). We did not detect any
binding of patients’ samples to tissue of the CNS (including
spinal cord and motor neurons), but both sera bound to
small DRG neurons of DRG sections and cultured DRG
(Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Double labelling for
TRPV1
and
IB4
displayed
that
these
neurons
were
TRPV1-positive and most of them were also IB4-positive
(Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Pre-absorption of sera

patients’ samples with Caspr-transfected HEK293 (B and C) cells and contactin-1-transfected cells as a control (E and F). Both patients as well as
commercial anti-Caspr show clear binding to Caspr-transfected HEK293 cells (B–D), but lack of binding to contactin-1 transfected HEK293 cells
(E and F). A normal control does not bind to Caspr-transfected HEK293 cells (A). When quantified by flow cytometry, binding is confirmed by
higher fluorescence intensity of the binding of patients’ sera compared to controls (G–I). Grey areas indicate the fluorescence of the normal
controls, red lines indicate patients’ samples.

 assays with DRG sections and neurons prevented binding
of patients’ IgG (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7).
Complement binding assay
Complement binding assays with samples of both patients
with Caspr-transfected
HEK293 cells were performed.
Distinct binding of C1q by HEK293 cells after binding of
patients’ IgG was only found in Patient 2 who mainly had
IgG3 anti-Caspr autoantibodies, not in Patient 1, where
IgG4 was the predominant subclass (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Discussion
Here, we give the first description of autoantibodies against
the paranodal protein Caspr in patients with inflammatory
neuropathies and provide a detailed clinical and histo-
pathological description of this condition, including evi-
dence of binding of IgG to the paranodes in a patient’s
sural nerve. The clinical picture of the patient with anti-
Caspr associated CIDP very much resembles the symptoms
described in patients with autoantibodies against neurofas-
cin-155 and contactin-1, namely acute onset of severe
motor more than sensory neuropathy, very good response
to treatment with rituximab, and demyelinating features in
nerve conduction studies, in contrast to axonal degener-
ation in nerve biopsies (Querol et al., 2013, 2014, 2015;
Doppler et al., 2015b; Miura et al., 2015). However, in
comparison to patients with anti-contactin-1 or anti-neuro-
fascin-155 autoantibodies, our patients did not present with
cerebellar tremor or spinal ataxia, and sera did not bind to
cerebellum, hippocampal neurons or large DRG neurons
(Querol et al., 2013; Miura et al., 2015). Instead, we de-
tected binding of both samples to small diameter TRPV1-
immunoreactive DRG neurons that are supposed to be
involved in pain perception. In both patients, pain was
the first symptom and both suffered from severe neuro-
pathic pain requiring treatment with pregabalin or opioids.
Neuropathic pain has not been described in patients with

subclasses of human IgG. Photomicrographs of immunofluorescence binding assays of patients’ samples (green), anti-Caspr (red) and DAPI

Weak binding of anti-IgG1 is detectable in Patient 1 (A and B), but not in Patient 2 (C and D). No binding of anti-IgG2 can be found in both
patients (E–H). Strong reactivity of anti-IgG3 is found in Patient 2 (K and L), not in Patient 1 (I and J). Anti-IgG4 shows strong immunoreactivity in
Patient 1 (M and N) but is negative in Patient 2 (O and P).

 autoantibodies against other paranodal proteins so far, but
some patients with chronic idiopathic pain have autoanti-
bodies against the juxtaparanodal protein Caspr-2 (Klein
et al., 2012). Pain resolved shortly after treatment with
rituximab in Patient 1 and resolved completely in Patient
2 after recovery. The quick relief of pain after treatment as
well as normal intraepidermal nerve fibre density as de-
tected in Patient 1 argues against small nerve fibre or neur-
onal damage in these patients but rather for a functional
effect by antibody binding to nociceptive neurons. As
described in other neuropathies with autoantibodies against
paranodal proteins (Querol et al., 2013, 2014; Doppler
et al., 2015b; Miura et al., 2015), motor symptoms were
more severe than sensory deficits in both patients. This
might correlate with stronger binding of both sera to the
paranodes of motor fibres compared to sensory fibres as
observed in our study. Exclusive binding to ventral but
not dorsal roots has recently been described in a passive
transfer rat model with autoantibodies against contactin-1
(Manso et al., 2016) and was observed in acute motor
axonal neuropathy (AMAN) patients with anti-GD1a auto-
antibodies (De Angelis et al., 2001). However, weak bind-
ing to sensory fibres as well as severe destruction of
paranodal architecture in the sural nerve in our study re-
flects sensory involvement, though less dominant than
motor symptoms.
So far, autoantibodies against paranodal proteins have
been described as associated with CIDP but not with GBS
(Querol et al., 2013; Doppler et al., 2015b), with the ex-
ception of anti-contactin-1 in rare cases of GBS, though
without binding to paranodes (Miura et al., 2015). In the
present study, we show distinct binding of antibodies of a

elongated nodes are detectable (double-ended arrows). Almost complete loss of Caspr-immunoreactivity is found at some nodes (C, arrows) or
at one side of the node (D, asterisks). Dispersion of Caspr to the juxtaparanodes and internodes is detected in another nerve fibre (C,
arrowheads), as well as an elongated node of Ranvier (C, double arrow). Scale bars = 10 mm. See Supplementary material for single channel images

 patient with GBS to the paranodes and confirmed anti-
Caspr autoantibodies by binding assays with Caspr-trans-
fected HEK293 cells. In contrast to Patient 1, who was
diagnosed with CIDP and to the other published patients
with autoantibodies against paranodal proteins (Querol
et al., 2013, 2014; Doppler et al., 2015b), no fibrillations
or positive sharp waves were found in Patient 2 by EMG,
arguing against axonal damage. This finding may support

autoantibodies at the paranodes. No binding is present when using a control nerve (B). Scale bar = 10 mm.

 the notion that binding of autoantibodies to the paranodes
alone can lead to a disruption of nerve conduction, not
only by induction of secondary axonal degeneration. A
rapid improvement of symptoms as usually seen in GBS
seems to be possible if the production of autoantibodies
does not persist. This pattern of acute neuropathy with
autoantibodies, quick recovery and absence of spontaneous
activity or temporal dispersion resembles a condition that
was described as a possible variant of AMAN associated
with anti-ganglioside autoantibodies: it has been hypothe-
sized that autoantibodies against gangliosides might induce
reversible conduction failure at the nodes leading to a vari-
ant of AMAN, termed AMAN with reversible conduction
block or acute motor conduction block neuropathy, that
can go along with quick recovery if no secondary axonal
damage occurs (Capasso et al., 2003; Kuwabara and Yuki,
2013). This condition was recently summarized by the term
‘nodo-paranodopathy’, emphasizing the node of Ranvier as
the site of pathogenic attack (Uncini, 2012; Uncini et al.,
2013). Histopathological evidence of paranodal disruption
in patients with autoantibodies against contactin-1 led to
the idea that the term ‘paranodopathy’ might also be ap-
propriate for the new entity of neuropathies with autoanti-
bodies against paranodal proteins (Doppler et al., 2015b).
Previously, we could not further strengthen the idea be-
cause reversible conduction failure could not be demon-
strated in our cohort of patients with anti-contactin-1
autoantibodies due to severe secondary axonal degener-
ation in all patients (Doppler et al., 2015b). The detection
of anti-Caspr autoantibodies in a new patient (Patient 2)
with the clinical picture of GBS with reversible conduction
block supports the idea of the concept of paranodopathy in
patients with autoantibodies against paranodal proteins.
Remarkably, autoantibodies of the subclass IgG3 were de-
tected in this patient and complement deposition was
found. Thus, dysfunction of the nodal/paranodal complex
may be complement-mediated in GBS with reversible con-
duction block and anti-Caspr autoantibodies, similar to
what has been assumed in patients with anti-ganglioside
autoantibodies (Susuki et al., 2012). Patient 1 also fits
into the concept of paranodopathy, but in addition he
had secondary axonal degeneration leading to spontaneous
activity on EMG. This may explain the long delay of re-
covery after treatment with rituximab and subsequent de-
cline of anti-Caspr titres.
As already described in patients with anti-contactin-1
autoantibodies (Doppler et al., 2015b), the nerve biopsy
of the patient with anti-Caspr did not show classical fea-
tures of demyelination like thinly myelinated fibres or
onion
bulbs,
indicating
that
the
paranodes/nodes
of
Ranvier are the site of attack in this subtype of inflamma-
tory neuropathy rather than the myelin sheath (Uncini,
2012; Uncini et al., 2013). Indeed, severe disruption of
the paranodal region and lengthening of the nodal gap
were detectable in teased fibres of the sural nerve of our
patient as well as in skin dermal nerve fibres. Furthermore,
we could demonstrate dispersion of sodium channels to the
paranodes as well as disruption of the band of sodium
channels in elongated nodes of Ranvier. This may be the
morphological equivalent of impaired nerve conduction at
the nodes of Ranvier. It resembles nodal changes that were
described in rabbits immunized with gangliosides and in
mice lacking gangliosides (Susuki et al., 2007a, b) but
never in patients with CIDP without the detection of auto-
antibodies (Li et al., 2005; Doppler et al., 2013).
Destruction of the paranodal architecture indicates a
pathogenic effect of autoantibodies affecting the paranodes
that is strengthened by the detection of deposition of IgG at
the paranodes in the sural nerve of Patient 1. However, the
exact pathogenic link between binding of autoantibodies
and paranodal destruction in patients with IgG4 autoanti-
bodies remains to be established. We did not detect any
binding of complement by complement binding assay in
Patient 1, which is consistent with the predominance of
IgG4 antibodies that do not bind complement. Functional
disturbance of the paranodal adhesion molecules may
underlie paranodal destruction and impairment of nerve
conduction, as already hypothesized in patients with anti-
contactin-1 autoantibodies (Labasque et al., 2014).
The presence of different subclasses of IgG in patients
with anti-Caspr autoantibodies, namely IgG3 in the pa-
tient with GBS and IgG4 in the patient with CIDP, is con-
sistent with a recent study of patients with anti-contactin-1
autoantibodies. In this former study we also found a pre-
dominance of IgG3 in two patients who were tested dur-
ing the acute GBS-like beginning of CIDP and two with
IgG4 who were analysed during the chronic phase of dis-
ease (Doppler et al., 2015b). The current findings sup-
port the idea of a switch to IgG4 at the chronic phase of
disease.
Summary
In summary, our study demonstrates that Caspr is another
antigen in the subgroup of inflammatory neuropathies with
autoantibodies
against
paranodal
proteins
and that
a
monophasic course of disease may occur. In contrast to
other neuropathies with antibodies to the paranodal com-
plex (anti-contactin-1, anti-neurofascin-155) both patients
with autoantibodies against Caspr suffered from severe
neuropathic pain. However, larger studies are needed to
clarify if neuropathic pain is a distinct feature of anti-
Caspr-associated neuropathy. We give further evidence
that ‘paranodopathies’ with autoantibodies against the
paranodal complex represent a well-defined entity within
the spectrum of inflammatory neuropathies with excellent
response to treatment with rituximab. This entity needs to
be taken into account in the diagnostic work-up of patients
with peripheral neuropathy as it represents a treatable con-
dition, where treatment significantly differs from the cur-
rent first-line treatments of CIDP.
