Abstract
Background: In 1982, the Annals of Virology published a paper showing how Liberia has a highly endemic
potential of Ebola warning health authorities of the risk for potential outbreaks; this journal is only available by
subscription. Limiting the accessibility of such knowledge may have reduced information propagation toward
public health actors who were indeed surprised by and unprepared for the 2014 epidemic. Open access (OA)
publication can allow for increased access to global health research (GHR). Our study aims to assess the use,
cost and impact of OA diffusion in the context of GHR.
Method: A total of 3366 research articles indexed under the Medical Heading Subject Heading “Global Health”
published between 2010 and 2014 were retrieved using PubMed to (1) quantify the uptake of various types of
OA, (2) estimate the article processing charges (APCs) of OA, and (3) analyse the relationship between different
types of OA, their scholarly impact and gross national income per capita of citing countries.
Results: Most GHR publications are not available directly on the journal’s website (69%). Further, 60.8% of
researchers do not self-archive their work even when it is free and in keeping with journal policy. The total
amount paid for APCs was estimated at US$1.7 million for 627 papers, with authors paying on average US$2732
per publication; 94% of APCs were paid to journals owned by the ten most prominent publication houses from
high-income countries. Researchers from low- and middle-income countries are generally citing less expensive
types of OA, while researchers in high-income countries are citing the most expensive OA.
Conclusions: Although OA may help in building global research capacity in GHR, the majority of publications
remain subscription only. It is logical and cost-efficient for institutions and researchers to promote OA by self-
archiving publications of restricted access, as it not only allows research to be cited by a broader audience, it
also augments citation rates. Although OA does not ensure full knowledge transfer from research to practice,
limiting public access can negatively impact implementation and outcomes of health policy and reduce public
understanding of health issues.

 Background
The 2014 Ebola outbreak proved disastrous for nations
such as Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which were
already rife with civil unrest [1]. Yet, in 1982, knowledge
that Liberia had a high potential of endemic Ebola had
been published in the Annals of Virology [2]. Local public
health institutions and officials were most likely unaware
of these findings as they remained hidden behind a pay-
wall in a subscription only journal. This may have contrib-
uted to the lack of preventative measures which could
have mitigated the severity and magnitude of the eventual
outbreak [3]. During the outbreak, understanding the evo-
lution of the epidemic from an epidemiological standpoint
was, in itself, difficult given the lack of investment in data
collection, sharing and management [4].
As mentioned by WHO in their report entitled Research
for Universal Health Coverage [5], accessible knowledge is
an important first step in the translation of knowledge
from research to policymakers and stakeholders in low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although access
to knowledge would not of itself have prevented or
averted the Ebola epidemic, better informed health offi-
cials might have taken timely preventive measures and
been better equipped to mitigate risks during and after the
outbreak [6]. Actually, in the recent Zika virus outbreak,
research is more readily accessible, providing evidence-
based knowledge faster to mitigate immediate and future
harms [7]. This may be due to consensus reached by im-
portant stakeholders (British Medical Journal, the Nature
journals, the New England Journal of Medicine, and the
seven PLoS journals) during the 2015 WHO consultation
promoting sharing of data, results and pre-prints during
public health emergencies [8].
As international healthcare research has evolved over
the past several decades, so has the sharing of know-
ledge. Prior to the 1990s, the involvement of multiple
international collaborators was much less prevalent and
usually limited to matters of complex disease control
(e.g. smallpox) [9]. Generally, the scope of ‘public
health’ was determined by the resource capacity and
geographical reach of a specific country or community
[10]. It was common practice for researchers from
high-income countries (HICs) to study health issues in
LMICs. However, this type of research in the field of
‘international health’ was exclusive in that it rarely in-
cluded or considered the interests and needs of re-
searchers and communities in LMICs [11]. Knowledge
remained with HIC research groups and was published
in subscription journals, held behind ‘paywalls’ – ex-
pensive subscriptions or toll access, affordable mainly
for HIC researchers and/or institutions. Restricting ac-
cess to knowledge from public health research that can
have direct influence in life or death contexts remains a
serious social justice concern [12].
The contemporary approach to global health research
(GHR) promotes partnerships that meaningfully include
researchers and communities from LMICs [13]. Re-
search ethics has developed benchmarks for ethical glo-
bal research to minimise exploitation of local players by
including them and giving them fair recognition in col-
laborative research partnerships [14]. Mutual capacity
building is encouraged so that researchers from both
HICs and LMICs may learn from each other [15, 16].
These partnerships can facilitate knowledge translation
among the diverse actors in LMIC health research, in-
cluding researchers, non-governmental organisations
and healthcare providers [17]. The intended outcome is
greater health equity on a global scale among people
and nations [10]. Since researchers in GHR are called
upon to work in a collaborative fashion for health
equity, sharing knowledge on a global scale is of central
importance [6, 16, 18].
There are different ways to increase access to pub-
lished knowledge. In LMICs, there are programmes such
as the Health Internetwork Access to Research Initiative
(HINARI), an initiative put together by WHO in collab-
oration with journal publishers, which provides greater
access to many different research resources including e-
books, textbooks and up to 14,000 journals, many of
which are subscription based [19]. HINARI’s goal is to
contribute to improving world health [19]. HINARI pro-
motes ideals central to GHR, such as furthering equity
in research access, but it does have important practical
limitations. While HINARI provides free access to re-
search institutions in low-income countries, it still re-
quires that medium-income countries pay ‘low cost fees’
(US$1500 per year) for full access to HINARI resources
[20]. Although these fees are indeed lower than the full
price for HINARI resources through subscriptions or toll
access, certain institutions – notably those that play
many other roles such as healthcare provision and health
prevention and promotion – have competing claims for
limited funding, may not prioritise research funding
within their institution, or may simply not have the ne-
cessary funding.
Moreover, since HINARI is a voluntary programme,
publishers may choose to opt out or restrict free access
status to specific countries; this creates uneven and
uncertain access for users. This instability was well ex-
emplified in 2011, when five publishers withdrew free
access to more than 2500 biomedical and health journals
including Elsevier’s Lancet journals from Bangladesh
[21]. Although free access was soon reinstated after pub-
lic outcry, the sustainability of such initiatives led by for-
profit publishers remains questionable [22]. In fact, a
similar withdrawal of access to various publishers in
Nigeria in 2013 and 2014 has had the effect of reducing
HINARI users in Nigeria [23]. It is noteworthy that the

 subscription journals are published almost exclusively
by Western publishers such as Wiley, Taylor & Francis,
Springer Nature, and Elsevier; the consequence of this
is a financially induced knowledge inequality focused
in the places where the research could have the highest
impact.
Open access (OA) is another method where scholarly
content is freely available online to all readers. Research
has shown that OA is associated with higher citation
rates [12, 24–26], likely as a consequence of wider ac-
cessibility. One main issue of certain high-profile OA
journals is the existence of significant article processing
fees (APCs) paid by authors, which may disadvantage
researchers who are unable to cover these costs,
emphasising the already significant inequity in research
dissemination [27]. Although many funding institutions
or universities may cover APCs [28], this is not system-
atically the case, especially in LMICs. To offset this fi-
nancial barrier, certain journals offer OA waivers for
researchers in low-income countries and in certain
middle-income countries [29]; however, criteria to ob-
tain waivers differ based on the journal.
It must be noted at the outset that the OA model has
also led to the creation of a number of ‘deceptive publi-
cation practices’ often referred to as ‘predatory journals’
that do not follow standard peer-review process and
often lack quality and transparency [12]. To ensure a
level of quality control, journals do traditionally have an
important role in managing the peer-review system
where experts critically review research before it is made
public. Regardless of the journal model – whether sub-
scription based or OA – a certain level of peer-review is
seen as essential [30].
Free access to knowledge may also be provided when
researchers self-archive their papers, as we often see in
public or institutional repositories. The copyright trans-
fer agreements of many journals allow for the archiving
of pre-prints and/or post-prints of journal articles, a
practice termed ‘green OA’. Journal policies that do not
allow for self-archiving often have an embargo period
during which they control access to peer-reviewed arti-
cles for a specific range of time (generally 6 months to
1 year in journals publishing GHR papers); the impetus
behind such embargos is to require institutions to pur-
chase and thus fund subscription-based journals.
Over the last few decades, many studies have analysed
the evolution of the OA availability of papers [31–36].
When one combines all different forms of OA, 50% of
all biomedical research papers published between 2004
and 2011 were freely available in 2013 [24]. The same
study shows that for the field of Public Health and
Health Services, of which GHR can be considered a sub-
field, the share of OA is slightly higher, with 57.2% [24].
Given the importance of worldwide knowledge access in
GHR, one might expect OA to be more prevalent in this
field than in others. However, some may consider APCs
to be simply too costly. The goal of this article is to (1)
quantify the uptake of various types of OA used in GHR
research, (2) calculate the financial costs of such prac-
tices from the authors’ point of view (paying for APCs),
and (3) assess the impact of different OA models as in-
dicated through citation analysis. Although there exist
many other elements that influence the use of OA in
GHR, such as journal prestige, general awareness,
funder requirements and availability of repositories,
these aspects are outside the scope of this specific re-
search. Since the main goal of this paper is to assess the
differences between different types of OA models, the
comparison of subscription costs paid by university
libraries and OA costs known as APCs paid by the
author(s) is beyond the scope of this paper.
Methods
The PubMed search engine was used to retrieve all
research articles indexed under the Medical Subject
Heading (MeSH) ‘Global Health’ from 2010 to 2014 [37].
From 1978 to 2014, research in global health was
indexed under ‘International Health’; however, with the
increase of institutions, research and journals in GHR
[38], ‘International Health’ was replaced by ‘Global
Health’ in 2015. This modification can be explained by
the historical shift described at the outset of this paper,
in which researchers wished to create global partner-
ships based on global equity. The analysis is based on
3366 GHR journal articles published in 909 journals. OA
availability was defined at journal level (Table 1) as well
as paper level (Table 2).
The OA status of a journal was determined using the
Directory of Open Access Journals, Ulrich’s Periodicals
Directory and journal lists from Elsevier, Sage, Springer
Nature, Taylor & Francis, and Wiley-Blackwell. Due to
conflicting and missing information, the status of each
journal was verified and APCs retrieved from the journal
websites. APCs were collected in or converted to USD.
If APCs were not provided in USD, currencies were con-
verted using the mean of weekly historical conversion
rates between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014
using OANDA [39]. To understand who benefits finan-
cially from OA, we identified publishers of journals (as
seen in [40]). The SHERPA RoMEO database was used
to determine whether self-archiving was formally sup-
ported or not. Self-archiving may come in different
forms, including pre-print (i.e. before peer-review), post-
print (i.e. after peer-review) or in the final PDF format-
ted by the journal publishers. We did not verify which
type of manuscript versions were shared (e.g. pre-print,
post-print), we only distinguished between journals that
did or did not allow self-archiving.

information
together
with
PubMed search as well as a manual Google search for
self-archived versions of articles published in subscrip-
tion journals. Since the main criteria is ‘availability’ of
research, we included articles online from various plat-
forms such as institutional repositories (e.g. university,
research centre), publicly based repository (e.g. PubMed
Central, Europe PMC, SciElo, BIREME), venture-capital
based online social networking sites that allows self-
archiving (e.g. academia.edu, researchgate.net), and
private pages owned by researchers. Since many closed
access journals allow for self-archiving, we compared
which toll access papers could be self-archived but
were not.
A citation analysis was carried out at the paper level to
compare the scholarly impact of different types of access
categories. Citations were obtained from the Web of
Science (WoS), thus restricting the set of papers from
3366 to 2655 papers. These citations were then normal-
ised by year. A normalised citation rate of 1.0 thus indi-
cates that a paper (or a set of papers) was cited according
to the expected average citation rate for the set of GHR
papers published in a particular year. A citation rate above
1 indicates impact above average and a citation rate below
1 indicates impact below average.
Using institutional affiliations of authors appearing
on citing articles, an analysis was conducted to explore
whether certain accessibility categories are cited more
or less predominantly by various countries depending
on their socio-economic context. Countries were cate-
gorised into (1) low-, (2) lower middle-, (3) upper mid-
dle- or (4) high-income countries [41]. A citing paper
written
by
authors
from

countries
was
assigned once per World Bank Atlas (WBA) country
group. Countries were retrieved manually for 374 citing

information. Two citing papers were excluded because
the authors’ addresses could not be determined and 50
citations
from
Guadeloupe,
Netherlands-Antilles,
Palestine and Reunion were excluded because they were
not classified by the WBA. The analysis of citing coun-
tries was normalised in a way that each paper was
weighted equally (as a percentage of citing papers) re-
gardless of their actual number of citations, as we
aimed to evaluate how the distribution of countries
changed per category. In other words, the over- and
under-representation of a WBA group among citations
per access category was calculated as the average per-
centage per paper per access category divided by the
overall average percentage of that WBA group. Re-
search was conducted using publicly available data and,
as such, is not considered ‘research on human subjects’;
such research is exempted from institutional review
board ethics approval. Datasets used for this study are
available online [42].
Results and Discussion
Uptake of OA
From 2010 to 2014, 909 journals published at least one
paper indexed as GHR. Figure 1 provides an overview of
the frequency of different access categories at the journal
(Fig. 1a) and paper level (Fig. 1b). Including both those
with and without APCs, 18.8% journals and 18.6% pa-
pers are available through gold OA. While there are less
gold OA journals with an APC, the percentage of papers
published in these periodicals (12.0%) exceeds those in
gold OA journals without an APC (8.6%), most likely be-
cause they are more renowned and have impact factors
(IFs) (such as Lancet Global Health, PLOS Medicine and
Global Health Action). The majority of journals (64.2%)
are hybrid, meaning that authors can choose to publish
research in closed access without financial cost or pro-
vide an APC and make the paper OA; still, only 6.8% of
papers make use of the hybrid OA option. If immediate
OA access is sought via the publisher, GHR researchers
seem to choose gold journals over hybrid ones. On the
paper level, 69.2% of all GHR publications are not avail-
able for free on the publishers’ website. However, 27.2%
of toll accessed papers are self-archived (also called
green OA) leaving a total of 42.0% of GHR papers only
accessible through subscription or toll access.
According to the archiving policy recorded by RoMEO,
84.0% of the 700 subscription and hybrid journals allow
green OA, while 7.4% explicitly prohibit it (8.9% of the
700 subscription and hybrid journals were not graded by
RoMEO). Among RoMEO-graded subscription and hy-
brid journals, we determined that 733 papers were self-
archived in accordance to journal policy and 1139 were
not self-archived, despite authors having the possibility of
doing so according to the journal policy. This shows that
60.8% of papers that could have been self-archived were
not. In a field where OA seems of practical and ethical im-
portance for the sharing of knowledge promoting health
equity, it is surprising that researchers do not make their
papers available when they are legally able to do so with-
out any cost; this suggest that authors might not be aware
of green OA policies.

 Cost of OA
Figure 2 presents the total APCs required for GHR pub-
lications over the 2010–2014 period, by publisher and
OA category. The total fees amounted to US$1.7 million
for 627 gold OA (APC) and hybrid papers; on average,
authors paid US$2732 (SD = US$1090) to make their
publication freely available on the publisher’s website.
These APCs can be explained by many factors, such as
the high scholarly capital associated with publishing in
journals of big publishers (which are generally hybrid),
as well as the presence of an oligopoly in the academic
publishing system [40]. Such oligopolistic conditions cre-
ate a limited market, reducing economic competition be-
tween publication houses and giving little incentive to
decrease prices. More specifically, according to our find-
ings, 93.4% of APCs were paid to journals owned by the
10 most prominent publishing companies. Elsevier alone
accounts for 22.8% of the total APCs and charged the
highest average gold APCs (on average US$4435 for 69
papers) among all publishers in the GHR set. Their
APCs for 26 hybrid fees were lower and close to the
GHR average at US$3271 per paper; nevertheless,
Elsevier’s hybrid uptake remained low at 3.5%.
Mean OA fees in hybrid journals (US$3240 per paper)
are higher than those in gold OA journals (US$2452),
which is somewhat surprising given that the former group
of journals already has revenues from subscriptions [43],
while APCs are the main source of revenues of the latter.
Historically, hybrid journals have justified this double
income stream as a way to reduce subscription fees
proportionally with the uptake of OA [44]. However,
this fee reduction has been questioned given the lack of
transparency of journal costs and the growing fees of
both APCs and subscriptions [45]. This lack of trans-
parency augments the possibility of a phenomenon of
‘double dipping’
, in which journals profit from both rev-
enue streams – APCs and subscriptions – without
readjusting the price based on APC uptake [46]. Even
though APCs are getting considerably expensive, they
continue to be promoted by many important stake-
holders and funders making gold and hybrid OA pub-
lishing a growing business [47].
Impact of OA
Figure 3 demonstrates the number of papers and the
mean number of citations per type of OA. Articles cate-
gorised as delayed, green and hybrid OA are cited above
average while toll access and gold OA papers are cited
below average. Of particular interest is the difference be-
tween green OA (1.5) and toll access (0.7), which shows
that self-archived papers receive more than twice as
many citations as those hidden behind a paywall, which
corroborates previous findings obtained in other fields
[48, 49]. It should be noted that the green OA articles
Fig. 2 Sum of gold and hybrid article processing charges per publisher
Smith et al. Health Research Policy and Systems  (2017) 15:73 
Page 6 of 10
 available on PubMed Central were cited more (1.9) than
those deposited on other platforms (1.3).
Hybrid articles were cited 37% more than the average
GHR paper and twice as much as toll access articles,
which supports the previous findings that OA broadens
citation impact. However, one has to keep in mind the
paramount
fees
for
hybrid
publishing,
while
self-
archiving comes at no charge to the author and a higher
increase in impact. Although proper IT infrastructure
and human resources are necessary to ensure an orga-
nised, indexed and sustainable repository, studies show
that such costs are meager compared to subscription or
gold and hybrid OA (e.g. [35, 50]). Articles published in
gold OA journals remained cited 40% below the average
GHR paper, with no difference between APC and non-
APC journals. The fact that the impact of gold OA pa-
pers is lower than those published in subscription jour-
nals (green, hybrid, toll) can be partly explained by the
fact that prestigious journals are largely subscription
journals, while many gold OA journals are younger and,
thus, are not as prestigious. Journal prestige is an im-
portant confounding factor that limits this type of study
[51]. Results for delayed OA and other papers are based
on as few as 49 and 16 papers, respectively. Given this
limited number, results are inconclusive.
Usage of GHR papers varied according to the socio-
economic situation of countries (Fig. 4). Indeed, 3.1% of
the 42,479 citing WBA category-cited paper combina-
tions came from low-income countries, 8.5% from lower
middle-income, 20.0% from upper middle-income and
68.4% from HICs. Such underrepresentation of re-
searchers from LMICs is well-known [52, 53]. Analysing
the average share of citing countries per paper, re-
searchers from low-income countries were, on average,
29.0% and 46.9% more likely to cite papers from gold
OA journals with and without an APC and 8.6% more

 likely to cite a green OA paper, while they were under-
represented on papers citing hybrid (–37.4%) and toll
access papers (–15.0%). The underrepresentation of
LMICs on papers citing hybrid papers show that, even
with availability on the publisher’s website, such articles
are rarely considered by LMIC researchers. This may
simply be the result of subscription journals not trad-
itionally being accessible and thus researchers are not
in the habit of searching in such resources. The re-
sults for HICs suggest that the type of access has less
influence on HIC authors. However, they are under-
represented on papers citing articles published in gold
OA journals with (–16.8) and without (–5.8) APCs,
which might again be explained by the lower prestige
of these journals in comparison to many traditional
subscription-based journals.
Limitations
The first limitation of this study pertains to the calculation
of green OA articles at the paper level. After we compiled
the number of PubMed articles that were freely available
in green OA format, we performed a manual search on
Google to assess other articles that may be freely access-
ible. We used the author’s name and the title of the article,
and then looked at the top ten results to find a green OA
article. We found many articles on institutional reposi-
tories, publicly based repositories and social media sites.
However, there may be some available research that was
simply not found by our search method.
The second limitation is regarding the calculation of
costs (APCs) paid by authors. In cost calculations, we
did
not
include
waivers
or
institutional
discounts.
Waivers can be given to cover part or all of APCs where
funding is limited, especially in the case where a re-
searcher is affiliated to an institution in a LMIC. Waivers
are generally granted on a case by case basis and are not
made public. Institutional discounts were also not in-
cluded in our calculation because they are quite variable
based on institution and year. In our study, APC costs
were gathered in 2016, but APCs were paid before that
time and thus may have been different – most likely
slightly lower due to inflation. Given all these factors,
the total APCs may be slightly overestimated herein.
The third limitation pertains to the categorisation of
citing papers written by authors from different countries
once per WBA country group. This decision was made
because it is not possible to know how much contribu-
tion each author made to the paper. We could (1) frac-
tionalise
by
number
of
authors
or
country
group
according to WBA classification or (2) count once for
each author or country group. Since we analyse on the
country level (or country group according to WBA) we
do not wish to risk punishing papers with multiple au-
thors that are in more than one country groups.
The fourth limitation is that we decided to compare
average citation rate of different access levels without
controlling for IF. We decided not to include the IF as it
is a flawed indicator already overused in the scientific
community [54]. It is also discipline-specific and not
readily comparable between fields. Additionally, in this
specific study, the majority of the 909 journals published
only one or a few papers; such an analysis would be per-
formed on very small amounts of data. However, herein,
we did make the logical assumption that closed journals
will most likely have more prestige because prestige is
built with time, something that is not yet acquired with
novel OA journals. Yet, there is no empirical evidence-
based research to validate this last assumption.
Conclusions
This paper explored publication practices of GHR re-
searchers, a field where sharing of knowledge is inherent
to its mission of equity in healthcare and essential to its
collaborative nature. Regardless of this emphasis on
sharing, our research shows that 42.0% of scholarly articles
are not freely available online even if many funders,
scholars and universities promote some form of OA
(mainly green or gold). While it is understandable that re-
searchers gravitate towards traditional, highly reputable
journals, it remains sobering to note that only 39.2% of pa-
pers published in journals that allow green OA, which
comes at no cost for the authors, were in fact self-
archived. Findings clearly show that self-archiving does
not only promote knowledge sharing but also increases
the impact of research. Many reasons could explain this
behaviour, such as a lack of knowledge of journals’ self-
archiving policies, lack of appropriate user-friendly self-
archiving platforms, lack of time or general unawareness
of the advantages of green OA (i.e. such as increased im-
pact). Researchers may think that publication in traditional
closed (paywalled) journals are sufficient because of initia-
tives such as HINARI, which provide a certain level of free
or low cost access to research for LMIC researchers.
Despite increased access provided by HINARI, LMIC
researchers are still underrepresented in citing subscrip-
tion journals. Our study supports the claim that increased
access through green and gold OA is reaching underrep-
resented researchers more so than subscription journal
articles. As such, it provides more research capability that
is at the centre of GHR. When researchers are to publish
their work in an accessible format it is important to
choose an OA type that best suits their needs and not as-
sume that the most expensive APC has the best impact,
reach and citability. In fact, hybrid OA journals, which
have the most expensive APCs, were the most underrep-
resented in LMICs. It remains unclear why APCs for
hybrid journals remain higher than gold APCs given the
fact that these journals also ask for subscription fees.

 Since the APCs are mainly paid to the ten same pub-
lishers creating an oligopoly, there is little incentive to
keep APCs low. This oligopoly may also run much
deeper than costs; it creates an important inequity in
publication. Although publishers may wish to include
researchers from LMICs through waivers, they have not
really included LMICs in the publication industry itself.
After witnessing significant inequities and issues related
to exploitation in global health, the impetus behind
GHR was to provide a space for equal partnerships.
Broadening these partnerships to the publication indus-
try, which is a significant gatekeeper in research, may
provide for a stronger voice for researchers in LMICs
with the goal of reducing power inequities in global
health more broadly.
