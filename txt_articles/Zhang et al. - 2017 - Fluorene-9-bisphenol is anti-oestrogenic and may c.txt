Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the production of plastic but has oestrogenic activity. Therefore,
BPA substitutes, such as fluorene-9-bisphenol (BHPF), have been introduced for the
production of so-called ‘BPA-free’ plastics. Here we show that BHPF is released from
commercial ‘BPA-free’ plastic bottles into drinking water and has anti-oestrogenic effects in
mice. We demonstrate that BHPF has anti-oestrogenic activity in vitro and, in an uterotrophic
assay in mice, induces low uterine weight, atrophic endometria and causes adverse
pregnancy outcomes, even at doses lower than those of BPA for which no observed adverse
effect have been reported. Female mice given water containing BHPF released from plastic
bottles, have detectable levels of BHPF in serum, low uterine weights and show decreased
expressions of oestrogen-responsive genes. We also detect BHPF in the plasma of
7/100 individuals, who regularly drink water from plastic bottles. Our data suggest that BPA
substitutes should be tested for anti-oestrogenic activity and call for further study of the
toxicological effects of BHPF on human health.

 T
he chemical bisphenol A (BPA) is produced in large
quantities for the production of polycarbonate (PC) and
epoxy resin plastics, which are used various daily life
products1–3. In recent years, BPA was shown to have oestrogenic
activity, linking BPA to endocrine diseases and to an increased
incidence of endocrine-related cancers3–9. Because materials
synthesized with BPA were widely used in packing materials for
food and beverages, and BPA can be released into food from such
containers1–3, many countries have restricted or banned the use
of BPA in materials or containers that come in contact with food,
especially baby bottles for milk or water. This ban has led to the
introduction of BPA substitutes by the plastics industry.
One such BPA substitute is, fluorene-9-bisphenol (CAS NO.
3236-71-3), also known as 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorene
(BHPF). BHPF is used in the synthesis of polyester polymers such
as PC, epoxy resins, polyurethanes, polyesters, polyarylates
and polyethers10–13. In recent years, materials containing BHPF
have been used to produce a variety of products, including
protective coatings, semiconductor encapsulations, composite
matrices, moulded products, insulation materials, solder-resistant
materials, epoxy floor coatings and structural adhesives, in the
electronics, aerospace, automobile and other industries. However,
whether BHPF is also used in materials or containers that come
into contact with food—including milk bottles, children’s bottles
and sippy cups—and whether humans are exposed to BHPF
remains unclear.
Over the past decades, studies2,3,14–16 have focused on the
oestrogenicity of BPA substitutes and related compounds,
attributing exposure to such compounds with endocrine-related
diseases, such as the loss of gender characteristics, precocious
puberty, low semen quality and obesity. However, the anti-
oestrogenicity of environmental pollutants, as well as the
potential adverse effects thereof, have rarely been studied.
Because oestrogens play a critical role in maintaining the
development of female reproductive organs and the course of
pregnancy,
anti-oestrogenic
effects
may
be
physiologically
important. Anti-oestrogenic drugs, such as tamoxifen (TAM)
and U39411, have been reported to prevent pregnancy, reduce
litter size and weight, and induce embryonic absorption in
animals. According to a report by WHO-UNEP entitled ‘State of
the Science of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals—2012,’ (ref. 17)
significant knowledge gaps exist on the association between
exposure
to
endocrine-disrupting
chemicals
and
adverse
pregnancy outcomes, even though the incidence of these
outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birth
weight and fetal death, has increased in many countries over the
last decades. Therefore, assessing the anti-oestrogenicity of
environmental pollutants and evaluating their effects on female
development and reproduction is important.
In the present study, we report the presence of BHPF in plastic
bottles, measure BHPF concentrations in water released from
commercial plastic bottles and in serum samples of human
volunteers, determine the anti-oestrogenic activity of BHPF by
in vitro, in vivo and in in silico assays, and evaluate the
developmental and reproductive toxicities of BHPF using mice
following subchronic exposure. We believe that this study will
extend the knowledge of environmental anti-oestrogens, and raise
awareness of anti-oestrogenic BPA substitutes and the possibility
of their causing adverse effects on human health.
Results
Determination of BHPF released from plastic bottles. BHPF
was identified in a fraction isolated from the methanol leachates
of plastic drink bottles labelled ‘BPA-free’ using 1H and 13C
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis (Fig. 1). The NMR
results are consistent with those for BHPF reported previously11.
After synthesis of a deuterated standard of BHPF (BHPF-d7)
(Methods, Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), a reliable derivatization
method for the sensitive quantification of BHPF in water by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was developed
(Methods, Supplementary Fig. 1c). We then studied the release of
BHPF from 52 commercial plastic bottles into drinking water.
The concentrations of BHPF in water samples that had been
contained in bottles of different materials are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1. The release of BHPF was detectable in
61.11% (11/18) of the water samples from PC bottles, with a
maximal concentration of 81.47 ng l � 1 from a PC water bottle
intended for adults. Because PC bottles for babies’ milk are
now prohibited in China, we purchased three PC bottles from
non-Chinese suppliers, and found that BHPF was detectable in
the water samples from these bottles. In addition, BHPF was also
detected in water from two bottles made of Eastman Tritan
copolyester, a BPA-free material.
BHPF in serum samples from college student volunteers.
Because BHPF is widely used in various products in daily life, and
human exposure occurs through drinking water, we further
determined the BHPF levels in serum samples from 100 college
student volunteers (50 male and 50 female) who habitually
used plastic bottles for drinking water. BHPF was detectable
in seven volunteers (four male and three female), with a mean
serum BHPF level of 0.34±0.21 ng ml � 1 and a maximal level of
0.7 ng ml � 1.
Anti-oestrogenic activity of BHPF in vitro. The oestrogenic
and anti-oestrogenic activities of BHPF were studied by a yeast
two-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The yeast
two-hybrid assay comprised the ligand-binding domain of human
oestrogen receptor a and a co-activator. The dual-luciferase
reporter assay comprised a full-length human oestrogen receptor
a or b and oestrogen response elements (EREs). As shown in
Fig. 2a, 17b-estradiol (E2) increased the b-galactosidase activity
in the yeast, with a half-maximal effect concentration of
1.28 � 10 � 9 M, but BHPF did not show oestrogenic activity;
however, when BHPF coexisted with 1 � 10 � 9 M E2, BHPF
showed strong anti-oestrogenic activity in a concentration-
dependent manner, and the half-inhibition concentration (IC50)
of
BHPF
was
5.44 � 10 � 7 M,
which
was
close
to
that
(4.50 � 10 � 7 M)
of
4-hydroxytamoxifen
(OHT)
(Fig.
2b).
Similarly, BHPF showed no oestrogenic activity but strong anti-
oestrogenic activities in the dual-luciferase reporter assays
(Fig. 2c–f). The IC50 values of BHPF were 1.09 � 10 � 7 and
7.53 � 10 � 8 M for oestrogen receptor a and oestrogen receptor b,
respectively, when BHPF coexisted with 1 � 10 � 9 M E2. A WST-
1 cell proliferation assay using human choriocarcinoma JEG-3
cells was performed, and no obvious cytotoxicity of BHPF
was observed from 1.0 � 10 � 6 M to lower concentrations
(Supplementary
Fig.
2).
The
IC50
values
of
OHT
were
8.61 � 10 � 9 and 5.19 � 10 � 9 M for oestrogen receptor a and
oestrogen receptor b, respectively, which were 12.66 and 14.51
times lower than those of BHTF in the dual-luciferase DLR
assays.
Docking of BHPF into active sites of oestrogen receptor a.
Molecular docking was performed to investigate the structural
basis of the observed anti-oestrogenic activity of BHPF, using
Scigress (Ultra Version 3.0.0, Fujitsu). We found that BHPF could
not be accommodated by the ligand pockets of oestrogen receptor
a (PDB IDs 1ERE, 3UU7, 3UUA and 3UUC), but BHPF could be
well fitted into the antagonist pocket of oestrogen receptor a

 (PDB ID 3ERT). The interaction between BHPF and the
antagonist pocket of oestrogen receptor a is shown in Fig. 2g. The
important features of the interaction are (a) the formation of
hydrogen bonds between a phenolic hydroxyl group of BHPF and
the carboxylate of Glu-353, the guanidinium group of Arg-394
and a water molecule (H2O 2) of the pocket—and (b) the van der
Waals forces between the phenyl rings of BHPF and the core
hydrophobic moiety provided by Leu-328, Met-342, Met-343,
Leu-346, Leu-349, Leu-384, Leu-387, Met-388, Leu-391, Phe-404,
Leu-410, Val-418, Met-421, Ile-424, Met-517 and Leu-525. As
shown in Fig. 2h, the optimal position of BHPF could be well
accommodated by the antagonist pocket of oestrogen receptor a,
with one of the phenol groups of BHPF located at the site for the
phenol group of OHT (the original ligand of the structure
(3ERT)), the other phenol group of BHPF located at the site for
the phenyl ring on the side chain of OHT, and the fluorene group
in the space for the 1-phenylpropylidene of OHT.
Anti-oestrogenic activity of BHPF in vivo. The uterotrophic
bioassay in rodents is a short-term in vivo screening test for
oestrogenic substances, which has occasionally been used to
determine
anti-oestrogenic
compounds
by
combination
with exogenous oestrogen. As shown in Fig. 3a, BHPF showed
neither uterotrophic nor anti-uterotrophic effects when singly
administered to mice for 3 days beginning on postnatal day
(PND) 21; however, when combined with E2, it significantly
(Po0.01, Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test) inhibited
the uterotrophic effect of E2 in the 250 and 500 mg kg � 1 d � 1
groups (Fig. 3b). Considering that endogenous oestrogens are
increasingly produced when mice reach puberty, an improved
anti-uterotrophic assay for evaluating the anti-oestrogenicity of a
chemical using female CD-1 mice (n ¼ 10) at a beginning age
(PND 24) close to puberty were developed by daily oral gavage of
fulvestrant (FULV) for 10 days. As shown in Fig. 3c, after 10 days
of treatment, the relative uterine weights were decreased in a
dose-dependent manner in the mice given FULV, indicating that
this anti-uterotrophic assay should be suitable for evaluating the
anti-oestrogenicity of chemicals. Using the improved assay, the
relative uterine weights were found to be significantly decreased
(Po0.05, Fisher’s LSD test) to B63.20, 59.59 and 52.80% that of
the control in mice given BHPF at doses of 27.8, 83.3
and 250 mg kg � 1 body weight (bw) per day, respectively
(Fig. 3d). The anti-uterotrophic activity of BHPF at a dose
of
27.8 mg kg � 1 bw d � 1
was
close
to
that
of
FULV
at
2 mg kg � 1 bw d � 1.
Opposite patterns of gene regulation by BHPF and E2. Analysis
of the global gene expression profiles in the livers, ovaries
and uteri of mice treated with 50 mg kg � 1 bw d � 1 of BHPF for 3
days compared with those of the control mice was performed
using an Agilent mouse gene expression microarray (Agilent
Technologies). In the livers, the expressions of 2,963 of the 55,821
genes and expressed-sequence tags (ESTs) evaluated was modified
by at least two-fold in mice after BHPF treatment (up-regulated
in 77.7% and down-regulated in 22.3%). GO analysis showed that
1,363 genes were enriched in 207 biological process categories,
such as defence responses, responses to stimuli, responses
to other organisms, multi-organism processes, immune system
processes,
responses
to
biotic
stimuli
and
inflammatory
responses. Pathway enrichment analyses showed that 302 altered
genes in the liver were enriched in 29 pathways, such as natural
killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, hematopoietic cell lineage and
autoimmune thyroid disease. In the ovaries, the expressions of
948 genes and ESTs was up-regulated (34.5%) or down-regulated
(65.5%) by at least two-fold after BHPF treatment. Among them,
488 genes were enriched in 45 biological process categories,
including immune
system processes,
responses to stimuli,
responses to E2 stimuli, responses to chemical stimuli, and
immune responses. The genes associated with ‘response to E2
stimuli’ were sprr2a, sprr2b, sprr2f and sprr2g, which were down-
regulated by BHPF. Pathway analyses showed that 98 genes were
enriched in 14 pathways, including natural killer cell-mediated
cytotoxicity, viral myocarditis, autoimmune thyroid disease,
and the B-cell receptor-signaling pathway. In the uteri, the
expressions of 1324 genes or ESTs was up-regulated (56.6%)
or down-regulated (43.4%) by at least two-fold after BHPF
treatment. Of them, 534 genes were enriched in 200 biological
processes, including responses to stimuli, responses to chemical
stimuli, responses to E2 stimuli, oxidation-reduction processes,
cholesterol homoeostasis and efflux, regulation of cholesterol

in 27 pathways, including complement and coagulation cascades,
drug metabolism, retinol metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics
by
cytochrome

hormone
biosynthesis,
and
androgen and oestrogen metabolism. The expression profile of
oestrogen-responsive genes in the uteri is of great concern, so we
compared our gene expression data with an expression profile of
oestrogen-responsive genes in the uteri of mice administered E2
from previously published data18. As shown in Fig. 4a, most of
the oestrogen-responsive genes exhibited the opposite expression
pattern in the uteri of mice treated with BHPF to that induced by
E2. Of particular note is the down-regulation of small proline-rich
proteins (SPRR), including Sprr2a2, Sprr2b, Sprr2d, Sprr2f and

 Sprr2g, in the uteri. In addition, we found that many genes
involved in
the biotransformation
and oxidation-reduction
processes were up-regulated in the uterus but not in the liver
(Fig. 4b). The expressions of 14 genes were quantified to validate
the microarray by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR), and it was found that
most genes showed similar results to those of the microarrays
(Supplementary Table 2). We selected sprr2a and sprr2b as
biomarker genes and studied their expressions in the uteri of the
mice
given
BHPF
at
doses
of
0,
9.26,
27.8,
83.3
and
250 mg kg � 1 bw d � 1 for 10 days. As shown in Fig. 4c, the
expressions of sprr2a and sprr2b were significantly decreased
in a dose-dependent manner; both genes were significantly
down-regulated by 9.26 mg kg � 1 bw d � 1 BHPF and higher doses
(Po0.05, Fisher’s LSD test).
Subchronic and reproductive toxicity of BHPF in mice. To
identify the subchronic and reproductive toxicity associated with
the anti-oestrogenicity of BHPF, mice were given doses of 0.4, 2,
10 and 50 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1 BHPF or 1.2 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1
TAM by oral gavage once every 3 days from PND 24. The body
weight evolution of the mice during the experiments is shown in
Fig. 5a,b. Before pairing, no significant differences in weight gain
were found in relation to the administration of these substances,
except in the male receiving 0.4 mg kg � 1 3-d � 1 BHPF, which
showed higher weight gain than the control from PND 30. After
mating, pregnancy-related weight gain was significantly decreased
in all of the BHPF-treated groups, but no pregnancy-related
weight gain was observed in the TAM-treated group because all of
the females were non-pregnant. The data obtained from the
subchronic and reproductive toxicity tests are summarized in
Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 5–7. After 36-day exposure,
10 females of each group were weighed and killed on PND 60.
The relative uterine weights were found to be decreased in a
dose-dependent manner in the mice that had been given BHPF
(Table 1). The relative uterine weight in the 2, 10 and
50 mg kg � 1 3-d � 1 BHPF groups and the 1.2 mg kg � 1 3-d � 1
TAM group were significantly (Po0.05, Fisher’s LSD test) lower
than that of the control. Histopathological examination found
serious atrophic endometria in the uteri of mice administered
BHPF and TAM. Figure 5c shows microscopic images of uterine
sections. The endometrial stromal cells and columnar epithelial
cells were observed to be atrophic in each of the mice treated with
BHPF, but in the TAM-treated mice, only atrophy of the endo-
metrial stromal cells was observed, while the columnar epithelial
cells were dilated. Because oestrogen primes the endometrium
and plays a key role in inducing its proliferation, the atrophy of
the endometrium caused by BHPF once again demonstrated the
strong anti-oestrogenicity of BHPF in vivo. The weights of the
ovaries on both sides were not affected in the BHPF groups, but
they were significantly decreased in the 1.2 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1
TAM group (Po0.01, Fisher’s LSD test). Analysis of ovary
sections showed that BHPF and TAM retarded follicular
development and reduced the numbers of corpora lutea (Fig. 5d).

 After a 7-day mating period, the male mice were weighed and
killed at the age of PND 84. The relative weights of the liver,
kidney, spleen, testes and accessory sex organs are summarized in
Supplementary Table 6. The relative weights of the seminal
vesicle and epididymis were found to be significantly (Po0.05,
Fisher’s LSD test) increased in the 10 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1 BHPF

 BHPF-administered animals, and the numbers of absorption sites
were increased in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly,
the numbers of live pups per litter in all of the BHPF groups were
lower than that of the control, and they were significantly
decreased in the 2 and 50 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1 BHPF groups
(Po0.05, Fisher’s LSD test). In addition, the birth weights of the
pups in the 2, 10 and 50 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1 BHPF groups were
significantly (Po0.01, Fisher’s LSD test) lower than that of the
control. However, the weights of the pups in all of the BHPF
groups were higher than that of the control on PND 4. The
acceleration in weight gain in the BHPF groups was attributed to
the smaller number of pups per litter in those groups, which
therefore received more milk per capita. There were 1, 3, 3 and 2
non-pregnant females in the 0.4, 2, 10 and 50 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1
BHPF groups, respectively. Histopathological examination found
that haemorrhagic ovary cysts occurred in both the TAM and
BHPF groups, which may have been another cause of the reduced
pregnancy rates besides the atrophic endometria and retarded
follicular development. Additionally, in a pregnant female of the
10 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1 BHPF group that did not parturite 4 days
after the estimated date of parturition, a dead fetus in late
pregnancy was observed in the uterus (Fig. 5f); and, moreover,
one case of late abortion with the uterus containing insufficiently
absorbed embryos (Fig. 5g) and one unexplained maternal death
during parturition were observed in the 50 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1
BHPF group.
Effects of low doses of BHPF relevant to human exposure. To
study the effects of BHPF at doses relevant to human exposure,
water samples with BHPF artificially added (100 ng l � 1 BHPF)
or released from ‘BPA-free’ plastic water bottles (Bottle A and
Bottle B) were given ad libitum to female CD-1 mice beginning
on PND 24. The mice of the Bottle A and Bottle B groups
received cooled boiled water that had been filled into Bottle A and
Bottle B, respectively, while still boiling, and their BHPF levels
were determined to be 124.35 and 23.81 ng l � 1, respectively.
After a 10-day exposure, the relative uterine weights in the
groups of 100 ng l � 1 BHPF, Bottle A, Bottle B, and the positive
control (100 ng l � 1 FULV) were decreased to 79.34%±26.99%,
76.62%±19.97%, 94.81%±34.45% and 77.89%±37.50% that of
the control (P40.05, Fisher’s LSD test), respectively (Fig. 5h).
The gene expressions of sprr2a and sprr2b in the uteri of the mice
were also studied by Q-RT-PCR (Fig. 5i). The expressions of
sprr2a were decreased in the groups of 100 ng l � 1 FULV,
100 ng l � 1 BHPF, and Bottle A, but no statistically significant
difference was observed (P40.05, Fisher’s LSD test). The gene
expressions of sprr2b were decreased in all of the test groups, and
were significantly lower (Po0.05, Fisher’s LSD test) than that of
the control in the groups of 100 ng l � 1 FULV and Bottle A.
Finally, the serum levels of BHPF in each mouse were determined
after enzymatic hydrolysis using b-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase.
Serum BHPF was detected only in the mice of the Bottle A
group (1.21±1.11 ng ml � 1), with BHPF levels in the range of
0.36–2.70 ng ml � 1, but no serum BHPF was detected in the
100 ng l � 1 BHPF group.
Discussion
Over the past two decades, oestrogenic substances have caused
great concern as endocrine-disrupting chemicals2,3,14–16. A large
number of natural or man-made oestrogenic substances have
been listed as environmental oestrogens, while relatively few
strongly anti-oestrogenic substances have been reported other
than anti-oestrogenic drugs, such as TAM, OHT, raloxifene and
FULV. In this study, BHPF showed strong anti-oestrogenic
activity in a yeast two-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase reporter
assays (Fig. 2b,d,f). The uterotrophic and vaginal cell cornification
assays are the most widely used in vivo assays for assessing
oestrogenic substances19. Although the vaginal cell cornification
assay has the advantage of being relatively simple and can use the
same animals repeatedly if the test compound does not
bioaccumulate, it is rarely used to evaluate anti-oestrogenic
substance and it has been criticized as being largely qualitative as
scoring is dependent on the evaluation of cellular contents of a
vaginal lavage19. The uterotrophic assay has been served as a test
for oestrogenic and anti-oestrogenic substances since 1930s
(ref. 20). Previous studies examining the effects of oestrogenic
and anti-oestrogenic substances on uterine wet weight have
used a number of different protocols and species; therefore,
uterotrophic assay requires validated operating procedures that
specify
species,
strain,
age
and
route
of
test
compound
administration19,20. In this study, we validated the uterotrophic
assay using FULV, a full oestrogen receptor antagonist, and then
evaluated the anti-oestrogenicity of BHPF. We found that BHPF
significantly inhibited the uterine weights of CD-1 mice in a
dose-dependent manner, and the anti-uterotrophic activity of
BHPF at a dose of 27.8 mg kg � 1 bw d � 1 was close to that of
FULV at 2 mg kg � 1 bw d � 1 (Fig. 3c,d). We analysed the global
gene expression profiles in the livers, ovaries and uteri of mice
treated with 50 mg kg � 1 d � 1 BHPF for 3 days. Gene ontology
analysis of the entire sets of up-regulated or down-regulated
genes in the ovaries and uteri of mice treated with BHPF revealed
the biological processes in response to E2 stimuli. By comparing
the gene expression profile in the uteri of mice given BHPF with
that reported in the uteri of mice given E2 (ref. 18), we found that
most of the oestrogen-responsive genes exhibited the opposite
expression pattern in the uteri of mice treated with BHPF to that

 induced by E2 (Fig. 4a). Of particular note is the down-regulation
of SPRRs, a cluster of genes known to be induced by oestrogens
through nuclear oestrogen receptors in mouse uteri21. Moreover,
it should be noted that BHPF might induce anti-oestrogenic
effects
through
mechanisms
other than
nuclear
oestrogen
receptors, as reported for BPA and some other bisphenols,
which can induce adverse effects through mechanisms including
the oestrogen membrane receptor, oestrogen-related receptor
gamma, pregnane X receptor and so on2,16,22–24. Our microarray
analysis
also
showed
that
some
genes
involved
in
biotransformation and oestrogen metabolism were up-regulated
in the uteri of the BHPF-treated mice (Fig. 4b), and the
up-regulation
of
these
genes
may
facilitate
the
in
utero
metabolism of oestrogen, thereby suppressing the effect of
oestrogen on the uterus. Molecular docking of BHPF into the
antagonist pocket of ERa (PDB ID 3ERT) showed that BHPF
could
be
well
accommodated
by
this
pocket
(Fig.
2h).
Interestingly, even though BHPF could not be accommodated
by the bisphenol C (BPC) pocket of the oestrogen receptor a
structure (PDB ID 3UUC), the optimal position of BHPF in
oestrogen receptor a (PDB ID 3ERT) was very similar to that of
BPC in the oestrogen receptor a structure (3UUC)25. It was
previously reported that BPC displayed almost full antagonistic
activity in the presence of E2, and that oestrogen receptor a with
BPC displayed an antagonist conformation similar to that of the
OHT-bound structure (3ERT)25. In addition, it was found that
BHPF inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells in a granted patent (CN102727470) (ref. 26). These findings
indicated the strong anti-oestrogenic activity of BHPF.
Serious developmental and reproductive effects of BHPF
associated with its anti-oestrogenic activity were observed in this
study. In the subchronic and reproductive toxicity tests, BHPF
significantly decreased the uterine weights and induced atrophic
endometria in the intact female mice at doses of 2 mg kg � 1 3-
d � 1 or higher by oral gavage for 36 days from PND 24 (Table 1).
These findings are consistent with a previous study on the anti-
oestrogen EM-800, which was found to reduce uterine weights
and cause atrophy of the endometrium following 28 days of oral
administration in intact female BALB/c mice at an age of B50
days27. We also found that BHPF reduced pregnancy-related
weight gain and caused embryonic absorption and fetal death
during pregnancy, and caused decreased birth weights of the
pups, in the reproductive toxicity study (Table 1). Because uterine
stromal cells are known to play a critical role in pregnancy-
associated neovascularization and embryo survival28, the adverse
pregnancy outcomes were thought to have been caused by the
atrophic endometria. Kaplan-Kraicer et al.17 orally administered
TAM or the anti-oestrogen RU39411 to rats before implantation
on day 2 of pregnancy, and found that low doses of TAM and
RU39411 reduced the litter sizes and weights and induced
embryonic absorption in some animals, while high doses
prevented pregnancy in all animals. The reproductive effects of
BHPF observed in this study are similar to those of RU39411 and
TAM, suggesting that its anti-oestrogenicity plays a critical role in
its reproductive toxicity. The incidence of adverse pregnancy
outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, low
birth weight and fetal death in humans, has increased in many
countries29–31, and it has been proposed that exposure to certain
environmental pollutants may be linked with these adverse
pregnancy outcomes16,30,31. This study provided evidence that
anti-oestrogenic chemical exposure may cause adverse pregnancy
outcomes, suggesting that environmental anti-oestrogens, as well
as their adverse effects on human reproductive health, should be
of concern.
In this study, we recruited 100 college student volunteers
(50 female and 50 male) who habitually drank from plastic
bottles, and measured their serum BHPF levels by GC–MS.
Although we do not know whether these bottles contained BHPF,
we found that BHPF was detectable in 7 volunteers (4 male and 3
female), with a mean serum BHPF level of 0.34±0.21 ng ml � 1
and a maximal level of 0.7 ng ml � 1. When we administered
cooled boiled water with a concentration of 124.35 ng l � 1 of
BHPF released from plastic bottles, ad libitum to female CD-1
mice for 10 days, beginning on PND 24, we detected serum BHPF
levels of 1.21±1.11 ng ml � 1 in the group receiving water from
Bottle A, suggesting that drinking cooled boiled water from
BHPF-containing plastic bottles may be sufficient to elevate
BHPF levels in human blood. In China and some other countries,
drinking boiled water is routine. Plastic bottles, being easily
transportable, are often used to store boiled drinking water.
Student
populations
(from
elementary
students
to
college
students) are among the most common users of plastic bottles.
Many students carry plastic bottles every day, and mostly drink
boiled water collected from public drinking-water heaters.
However, because students (particularly elementary and middle
school students) are at developmental stages from prepuberty to
sexual maturity, the effects of anti-oestrogenic pollutants on these
populations deserve particular attention.
In the dual-luciferase reporter assays, the IC50 values of BHPF,
that is, the concentrations of BHPF inhibiting 50% of the activity
of 1 nM (E272.38 pg ml � 1) E2, were 1.09 � 10 � 7 M for
oestrogen receptor a and 7.53 � 10 � 8 M for oestrogen receptor
b (Fig. 2d,f); converting the molar concentrations to mass
concentrations, these correspond to 38.19 and 26.39 ng ml � 1,
respectively. Therefore, the IC50 values of BHPF were only
B54.56 and 37.70 times higher than the maximal serum BHPF
level (0.7 ng ml � 1) detected in the human volunteers, and
B31.56 and 21.81 times higher than the mean serum BHPF
level of 1.21±1.11 ng ml � 1 in the female mice of the Bottle A
group. It is notable that 272.38 pg ml � 1 E2 is a relatively high
level in serum for healthy adult women, which would be expected
to occur only as the follicle matures, with peak E2 levels of
B200–300 pg ml � 1
just
before
ovulation
in
the
normal
menstrual cycle. Moreover, in the female mice given water
containing BHPF at concentrations relevant to human exposure,
low uterine weights and decreased expressions of oestrogen-
responsive genes were observed (Fig. 5h,i). These results indicated
the risk that BHPF may antagonize endogenous oestrogens and
disrupt the normal physiological effects of oestrogens at doses
relevant to human exposure.
In principle, substitutes for hazardous chemicals should
present
lower
risks
than
the
original
substances.
Several
guideline-compliant toxicity studies have found a systemic no-
observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 5 mg kg � 1 bw day � 1
for
BPA
and
a
reproductive/developmental
NOAEL
of
50 mg kg � 1 bw day � 1 for BPA in rats and mice32–34. However,
some BPA substitutes, such as bisphenol S, bisphenol F, bisphenol
AF and BPC, were recently reported to be as hormonally active as
BPA, and have been detected in food and human urine samples in
several countries25,35–38. In this study, we found that BHPF could
be released from plastic bottles into drinking water, whereupon it
was detectable in the serum samples of a small proportion of
human volunteers; it induced atrophic endometria at doses of
0.4 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1 or higher and caused adverse pregnancy
outcomes at doses of 2 mg kg � 1 bw 3-d � 1 or higher in CD-1
mice; and in female mice given water containing BHPF at doses
relevant to human exposure, low uterine weights and decreased
expressions
of
oestrogen-responsive
genes
were
observed.
These findings suggest that substitutes for BPA may also be
toxicologically problematic.

 tests using CD-1 mice showed that BHPF could reduce uterine
weights and induce atrophic endometria in females, reduce
pregnancy-related weight gain and cause embryonic absorption
and fetal death during pregnancy, and reduce the birth weights of
pups at doses lower than the NOAEL reported for BPA. In
prepubertal female mice given ad libitum water containing BHPF
at concentrations relevant to human exposure, low uterine
weights and decreased expressions of oestrogen-responsive genes
were observed; and BHPF was detected in the serum of mice
given cooled boiled water containing higher levels of BHPF
released from plastic bottles. These results hint at potential the
health risks of BHPF, suggesting that it may not be safe for the
use in materials that come into contact with food. Screening
programs for endocrine disruptors have been established in many
countries in recent years, but many of these programs do not
screen compounds for anti-oestrogenic activity. Our results
suggest that anti-oestrogenic pollutants, such as BHPF, as well
as their adverse effects on human health, warrant further study.
Moreover, this study raises questions about the safety of
BPA substitutes and the current toxicological management of
substitutes for hazardous chemicals.
Methods
Chemicals. Methanol, acetone and hexane were HPLC-grade, obtained from
Fisher Chemicals (Fair Lawn, NJ). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was ACS-grade,
obtained from AMRESCO. BHPF (498%), E2 (Z98%), OHT (Z98%), FULV
(498%) and 9-fluorenone (498%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis,
MO). TAM (Z99%) was obtained from Aladdin Reagents (Shanghai, China).
Phenol-d5 (RING-D5,498%) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories
(Andover, MA). b-Mercaptopropionic acid (498%) was obtained from Tokyo
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan).
Identification of BHPF from a plastic bottle by NMR. Methanol leachates from
the grated plastic of a ‘BPA-free’ bottle were isolated and purified by liquid
chromatography with a C18 preparative column. The purified substance was used
for 1H and 13C NMR analysis. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at
400 and 600 MHz on a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer and a Bruker AVANCE
DRX-600 spectrometer, respectively.
Synthesis of deuterated BHPF. A mixture of 9-fluorenone, phenol-d5 and
b-mercaptopropionic acid was added to a 50 ml three-neck bottom flask equipped
with a magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser and thermometer, and then concentrated
sulphuric acid was slowly added dropwise with stirring. The mixture was heated at
55 �C for 4 h, and then washed several times with water and methanol, and dried.
The dried powder was recrystallized from toluene, and deuterated BHPF was
obtained. By analysis of this deuterated BHPF, it was identified as BHPF-d7
(Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), which was used as a surrogate standard for the GC–MS
analysis of BHPF.
Analysis of BHPF in water released from plastic bottles. Fifty two plastic
bottles, including adult water bottles, children water bottles and sippy cups, and
baby milk bottles, with volume in the range of 240–1,000 ml, were purchased in
China and in foreign markets (Supplementary Table 1). The plastic bottles were
filled with water heated to 60 �C, and allowed to sit for 6 h before the determination
of BHPF. A water sample spiked with 20 ng of surrogate standard (BHPF-d7) was
extracted on a Phenomenex strata-x SPE cartridge (500 mg 6 ml � 1). The cartridges
were preconditioned with 20 ml of methanol and 8 ml of distilled water, and then
rinsed with 5 ml of distilled water and 8 ml of methanol/water (1:20, v/v). After
being dried under a flow of nitrogen, the cartridge was eluted with 8 ml of
methanol. The extracts were then dried under a flow of nitrogen and derivatized
with 100 ml BSTFA þ 1% TMCS (Regis Technologies, Inc., Morton Grove, IL) in
acetone. After 30 min of reaction, 1 ml of water was added to the incubation
mixtures, and they were extracted with n-hexane (1:1) three times. The extracts
were evaporated to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream and dissolved in 100 ml
of n-hexane for GC–MS analysis (Agilent 7890A/5975C). An HP-5MS capillary
column (30 m � 0.25 mm � 0.25 mm film thickness; Agilent) was used to separate
the target chemicals. A splitless injector was used and was maintained at 300 �C.
The temperature program ranged from 100 to 300 �C at a rate of 15 �C min � 1.
The interface temperature, ion temperature and quadrupole temperature were
maintained at 300, 230 and 150 �C, respectively. The carrier gas was helium
supplied at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min � 1. The injection volume was 1 ml.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1b, O-bis(trimethylsilyl) derivatives were observed
at m/z ¼ 494 and 501 for BHPF and BHPF-d7, respectively. The recoveries of BHPF
and BHPF-d7 in the spiked water samples were in the range of 80.8–103.5%, and
the limit of detection was calculated as 0.1 ng l � 1.
Analysis of BHPF in human serum. In China, college students usually undergo a
physical examination before graduation. The volunteers in this study were senior
students who were undergoing a physical examination in Beijing. Fifty male and 50
female healthy volunteers (mean age, 23.5±1.2 years) who habitually used plastic
water bottles were randomly recruited to participate in this study in June 2015,
after appropriate ethical approval was received from the Human Ethics Committee
of the Peking University Peoples’ Hospital. Each participant provided informed
consent and volunteered to give one 10-ml random sample of blood. Fasting blood
was collected at Peking University Hospital Medical Center with vacutainer blood
collection device (Chengwu Yongkang Medical Products Ltd., China) between 8
and 9 h. The blood collection device principally consisted of a steel needle with
sharp ends, which linked the blood–vessel lumen with the glass vacutainer tube
during blood collection, and a polypropylene auxiliary syringe for holding the
blood, which had been verified to be free of BHPF contamination. The blood was
collected directly into plain 10-ml glass vacutainer tubes and spun down 30 min
later for serum preparation. The serum samples were stored in glass tubes
at � 80 �C until analysis. The samples were fortified with 5 ng of surrogate
standard BHPF-d7, and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 with ammonium acetate.
b-Glucuronidase/arylsulfatase (20 ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added to
the samples, and they were incubated at 37 �C for 20 h to allow deglucuronidation.
After enzymatic hydrolysis, the samples were diluted and loaded onto a
Phenomenex strata-x SPE cartridge (200 mg 3 ml � 1) that had previously been
conditioned with 6 ml of methanol and 3 ml of distilled water. The cartridge was
rinsed with 3 ml of distilled water and 4 ml of methanol/water (1:20, v/v). After
being dried under a flow of nitrogen, the cartridge was eluted with 4 ml of
methanol. The eluate was evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in n-hexane
for GC–MS analysis. All analytical procedures were checked for precision,
reproducibility, blank contamination and linearity. Quality control was maintained
by analysing a method blank (calf serum) and two spiked calf serum samples
(piked with BHPF-d7 singly or a mixture of BHPF-d7 and undeuterated BHPF)
along with every 12 samples. No BHPF was detected in the blank and single
BHPF-d7 spiked calf serum samples during the analytical procedures. The
detection limit (0.1 ng ml � 1) was based upon the criterion of the instrument
having a signal-to-noise response of 3:1.
Yeast two-hybrid assay. The oestrogenic and anti-oestrogenic activities of BHPF
were tested by a yeast two-hybrid assay with human oestrogen receptor a and the
coactivator transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (refs 39,40). Yeast cells
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190) expressing the human oestrogen receptor a (ERa)
were grown overnight at 30 �C with vigorous shaking in synthetic defined medium
lacking tryptophan and leucine. The overnight culture was then added to fresh
medium and treated with test chemicals at 30 �C for 4 h. After the incubation, the
treated cells were collected and digested with 1 mg ml � 1 Zymolyase-20T
(Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo) at 37 �C for 20 min, and then 2-Nitrophenyl
b-D-galactopyranoside was added to the lysate to a final concentration of
4 mg ml � 1. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the yellow colour
developed and 100 ml of 1 M Na2CO3 were added to stop the reaction. Then, the
yeast debris was removed by centrifugation and b-galactosidase activities were
determined by measuring the absorbance of supernatant at 415 nm in a
spectrophotometer. To determine whether BHPF possessed anti-oestrogenic
activity, 1 nM of E2 with the diluted BHPF was added to the medium. OHT was
used as a positive control. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Sigmoidal
dose–effect curves were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 4 software. The IC50
values were calculated on the basis of the sigmoidal dose-effect curves.
Dual-luciferase reporter assays. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were carried out
primarily according to the method described in a previous study41. In short,
full-length sequences of human oestrogen receptor a and b were amplified by
RT-PCR using mRNA from MCF-7 (Supplementary Table 3), and inserted into a
pSVSPORT1 (Invitrogen); the resulting constructs were termed pSVhERa and
pSVhERb. A reporter plasmid containing ERE was constructed by inserting four
tandem repeats of an ERE of Xenopus laevis vitellogenin A2 into a pGL4.23 vector
(Promega), and was termed pGL4-ERE-luc. All of the plasmids constructed were
confirmed by sequence analysis. The Renilla LUC control reporter construct
pGL4.74-TK was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Human
choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells (ATCC No. HTB-36) were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and were cultured in
minimal essential medium (MEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 2 mM
L-glutamine, 0.1 mM minimal essential medium nonessential amino acid solution
(Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY), and 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS) at 37 �C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells
(3 � 104 cells per well) were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h before transfection. The
cells were transfected with pGL4-ERE-luc (5 ng per well), pGL 4.74-TK (0.2 ng per
well) and either pSVhERa (5 ng per well) or pSVhERb (5 ng per well) using
Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). At 24 h after transfection, the compounds in
DMSO were added to the cultures at a volume ratio (v/v) of 0.1%. The cells were

 continuously cultured in medium supplemented with 1% charcoal-stripped FCS for
another 24 h and then harvested, and cell extracts were assayed for firefly luciferase
activity. The assays were performed in quadruplicate, and the results were
expressed as the fold induction of the control after normalization against Renilla
luciferase activity. Sigmoidal dose-effect curves were calculated using the GraphPad
Prism 4 software. The IC50 values were calculated on the basis of the sigmoidal
dose-effect curves. Finally, a WST-1 cell proliferation assay was performed to
evaluate the cytotoxicity of BHPF using the cell proliferation reagent WST-1
(Dojindo, Mashiki, Japan). Aliquots (200 ml) of JEG-3 cells (1 � 104 cells per well)
were seeded into 96 well-plates and precultured for 24 h. The cells were then
treated with various concentrations of BHPF. After another 24 h, 20 ml of 5 mM
WST-1 with 0.2 mM 1-Methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate was added
for 4 h before the absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a microplate reader
(iMark, BioRad). The WST-1 cell proliferation assay was performed in
quadruplicate.
Molecular docking. Scigress (Ultra Version 3.0.0, Fujitsu) was used for in silico
molecular docking analysis42,43. The three-dimensional structures of the ligand-
binding domain of human oestrogen receptor a, PDB IDs 1ERE, 3UU7, 3UUA,
3UUC and 3ERT, were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank website
(http://www.rcsb.org.pdb) and used to evaluate the binding affinities of BHPF in
the agonist and antagonist pockets of human oestrogen receptor a, respectively.
The structures were refined, and all of the water molecules were removed from the
protein, except for those that were important to the ligand-binding pocket
composition, using Scigress-integrated procedures. The structures of BHPF and the
original ligands were drawn, cleaned, and energy-optimized for molecular
modulation. Automated docking of the flexible ligands into the flexible active sites
was carried out using a genetic algorithm. The docking calculations were evaluated
on a 0.25 Å grid in a 15 � 15 � 15 Å box containing the active site for the original
ligand. The local search parameters included 300 maximum iterations at a rate of
0.06, and the procedure was set to run 30,000 generations with an initial population
size of 50, an elitism of 7, a crossover of 0.8, a mutation of 0.2, and a convergence of
1.0.0. After automated docking, a geometric optimization calculation was
performed for the human oestrogen receptor a-BHPF complex using augmented
MM3 parameters.
Anti-uterotrophic assays using mice. All animal studies were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University, and were
performed in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the
university, which meet the ethical guidelines for experimental animals in China.
Immature female CD-1 mice (20 days old) were obtained from Experimental
Animal Tech Co. of Weitonglihua (Beijing, China). Mice with a maximal difference
in body weight of 1 g were selected for the experiments and randomly assigned to
either the treatment or control groups. The animals were housed five to a cage and
acclimatized in a controlled environment with a temperature of 22±2 �C, a relative
humidity between 40 and 60%, and artificial lighting in a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle.
The animals were fed ad libitum with a basic diet from the Laboratory Animal
Center of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Beijing, China), and drinking
water was provided ad libitum. Before the experiments, the mice were randomly
assigned to either the treatment or the control group (n ¼ 10). Mice treated with
peanut oil were used as a vehicle control, and the chemicals were dissolved in
peanut oil to the appropriate concentrations. The volume of vehicle or chemical
solutions administered was adjusted daily based on body weight measured during
the dosing period according to the volume-body weight ratio of 5 ml kg � 1 bw. The
treatment via oral gavage to each mouse was performed for 10 days beginning on
PND 24. Mice in each cage were labelled by shaving hair on different parts of the
body, and the oral gavage treatment was performed in turns for each group,
whereby in each turn only one mouse in a group was treated. After the period of
treatment, the mice were weighed and killed 24 h after the final treatment
according to the sequence of the treatments, and the uteri were removed, blotted
and weighed by one experimenter to reduce the risk of bias in the data collection.
The relative uterine weight, that is, the ratio of uterine weight to final body weight,
was calculated to evaluate the anti-uterotrophic activity of the chemicals.
Expression profiling and Q-RT-PCR. Immature female CD-1 mice were obtained
from Experimental Animal Tech Co. of Weitonglihua (Beijing, China) and
acclimatized in an experimental environment with a temperature of 22 �C±2 �C,
relative humidity between 40 and 60%, and artificial lighting in a 12 h/12 h light-
dark cycle. The animals were fed ad libitum with a basic diet from the Laboratory
Animal Center of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Beijing, China), and
drinking water was provided ad libitum. The mice were treated with 50 mg kg � 1
bw d � 1 of BHPF or peanut oil via oral gavage for 3 days beginning on PND 21. On
PND 24, mice of each group were weighed and killed by cervical dislocation. The
uteri, ovaries and livers were collected for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was
isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified by NucleoSpin RNA
Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). Fluorescence labelling of the RNA samples
was performed with a Jingxin cRNA linear amplification and labelling kit
(CapitalBio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA from
each pool of tissue samples (a mixture from three animals) was used for microarray
analysis. Cy3 dCTP was used to label the samples. The labelled products were
added to SurePrint G3 mouse gene expression 8 � 60 K microarrays (Agilent) and
incubated overnight at 42 �C. Following hybridization, the gene arrays were washed
and scanned using an Agilent G2565CA Microarray Scanner. Glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control to
monitor the quality of the target preparation. The data were processed with feature
extraction software (GeneSpring GX v.11; Agilent). The raw signals were
log-transformed and normalized with the percentile shift normalization method.
All arrays met the minimum Agilent QA/QC standards. To verify the data from the
gene array, 14 genes were chosen as candidates for Q-RT-PCR. Primers are listed
in Supplementary Table 4. GAPDH was used as an endogenous control.
Amplification was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative expression
was quantified using the 2( � DDCt) method. The Gene Ontology (GO) and
KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed with DAVID (refs 40,41).
Sprr2a and sprr2b were selected as biomarker genes, and their expressions in the
uteri of the mice (n ¼ 10) given BHPF at doses of 0, 9.26, 27.8, 83.3 and
250 mg kg � 1 bw d � 1 for 10 days were studied by Q-RT-PCR.
Subchronic and reproductive toxicity tests using mice. Immature CD-1 mice
(20 days old) were obtained from Experimental Animal Tech Co. of Weitonglihua
(Beijing, China) and acclimatized in an experimental environment with a
temperature of 22 �C±2 �C, relative humidity between 40 and 60%, and artificial
lighting in a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle. The animals were fed ad libitum with a
basic diet from the Laboratory Animal Center of the Academy of Military Medical
Sciences (Beijing, China), and drinking water was provided ad libitum. The animals
were randomized into 6 groups (vehicle control group, 0.4, 2, 10 and 50 mg kg � 1
BHPF groups, and 1.2 mg kg � 1 TAM group) with 15 males and 25 females per
group. The animals were housed five to a cage until the pairing date. The treatment
via oral gavage of each mouse was performed once every 3 days beginning on PND
24. The chemicals were dissolved in peanut oil to the appropriate concentrations.
The volume of vehicle or chemical solutions administered was adjusted daily based
on body weight measured during the dosing period according to the volume-body
weight ratio of 5 ml kg � 1 bw. On PND 60, 10 females of each group were weighed
and killed by cervical dislocation. The uteri, ovaries, livers, kidneys and spleens
were weighed and collected for histological analysis. At the age of PND 77, males
and females were paired. Each morning, the females were examined for the pre-
sence of vaginal plugs. Gestational day 1 was defined as the day on which a vaginal
plug was found. In cases where pairing was unsuccessful, females were re-mated
with proven males of the same group, except that females in the 1.2 mg kg � 1 TAM
group were re-mated with proven males of the control group. After a 7-day mating
period, the males were weighed and killed, and organs were weighed and collected
for further analysis. Cauda epididymal sperm was collected from each mouse and
observed under a trinocular microscope (Olympus BX53) in physiological saline.
A microscopic video was recorded and analysed for sperm quality evaluation. The
treatment via oral gavage was continued for the females until day 19 of pregnancy.
On post-partum days 0 and 4, the weights of the dams and pups were recorded and
the pups were checked for abnormalities. On post-partum day 4, the dams were
weighed and killed, and their organs were weighed and collected for further
analysis. The ovaries and uteri were examined for the numbers of corpora lutea and
implantation sites, respectively. Finally, the non-pregnant and nulliparous females
were killed for histopathological analysis. For histological examination, organs and
tissues were fixed in formalin fixation, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned serially
at 5 mm. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and observed
under a light microscope (Olympus BX53).
Exposure experiment through drinking water using mice. Immature female
CD-1 mice (20 days old) were obtained from Experimental Animal Tech Co. of
Weitonglihua (Beijing, China). Mice with a maximal difference in body weight of
1 g were selected for the experiments and randomly assigned to either the treatment
or control groups. The animals were housed four to a cage and acclimatized in a
controlled environment with a temperature of 22 �C±2 �C, relative humidity
between 40 and 60%, and artificial lighting in a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle. The
animals were fed ad libitum an oestrogen-free diet from Trophic Animal Feed
High-tech Co., Ltd. (Nantong, China), and drinking water was provided ad libitum
in glass bottles. Before the experiments, the mice were randomly assigned to five
groups (n ¼ 8). Ultra-pure water was used as a control. FULV was dissolved in
ultra-pure water to a concentration of 100 ng l � 1 and used as a positive control.
BHPF was dissolved in ultra-pure water to prepare a concentration of 100 ng l � 1,
which is relevant to human exposure. Two plastic drinking bottles labelled
‘BPA-free’, of different brands, were purchased and denoted Bottle A and Bottle B.
The plastic bottles were filled with boiling ultra-pure water from a stainless steel
electric water heater and allowed to cool down to room temperature before the
animal experiment. The BHPF levels in the cooled boiled waters from Bottle A,
Bottle B and the stainless steel electric water heater were determined by GC–MS.
No BHPF was detected in the cooled boiled water from the stainless steel electric
water heater. The cooled boiled waters from Bottle A and Bottle B were transferred
to glass bottles during the experiment. The exposure experiment was performed for
10 days beginning on PND 24. After the period of exposure, the mice were weighed
and killed in turns for each group, whereby in each turn only one mouse in a group

 was killed. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture soon after each animal was
killed, and the uteri were removed, blotted and weighed by one experimenter to
reduce the risk of bias in the data collection and immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen for gene expression analysis. The relative uterine weight was calculated to
evaluate the anti-uterotrophic activity. The serum was separated by centrifugation
and frozen at � 20 �C for BHPF analysis. The serum BHPF levels were analysed by
GC–MS using the same method as that for human serum. The gene expressions of
sprr2a and sprr2b in the uteri were determined by Q-RT-PCR.
Data analysis. Data analysis was performed with the statistical program SPSS
(v.18.0; Chicago, IL). The data are presented as the mean and s.d. unless otherwise
indicated. Group differences were assessed by one-way analysis of variance and
Fisher’s LSD tests after running the one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the
test of homogeneity of variances. P values of o0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Data availability. Microarray data are deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession code
GSE74066. All the other data supporting the findings of this study are available
from the corresponding authors on request.
