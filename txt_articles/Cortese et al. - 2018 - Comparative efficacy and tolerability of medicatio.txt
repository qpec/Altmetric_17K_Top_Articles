Summary
Background The benefits and safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain 
controversial, and guidelines are inconsistent on which medications are preferred across different age groups. 
We aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of oral medications for ADHD in children, adolescents, 
and adults.
Methods We did a literature search for published and unpublished double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing 
amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and 
modafinil with each other or placebo. We systematically contacted study authors and drug manufacturers for additional 
information. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on teachers’ and 
clinicians’ ratings) and tolerability (proportion of patients who dropped out of studies because of side-effects) at 
timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) and standardised 
mean differences (SMDs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. We assessed the risk of bias 
of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and confidence of estimates with the Grading of Recommen 
d-
ations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for network meta-analyses. This study is registered with 
PROSPERO, number CRD42014008976.
Findings 133 double-blind randomised controlled trials (81 in children and adolescents, 51 in adults, and one in both) 
were included. The analysis of efficacy closest to 12 weeks was based on 10 068 children and adolescents and 8131 adults; 
the analysis of tolerability was based on 11 018 children and adolescents and 5362 adults. The confidence of estimates 
varied from high or moderate (for some comparisons) to low or very low (for most indirect comparisons). For ADHD 
core symptoms rated by clinicians in children and adolescents closest to 12 weeks, all included drugs were superior to 
placebo (eg, SMD –1·02, 95% CI –1·19 to –0·85 for amphetamines, –0·78, –0·93 to –0·62 for methylphenidate, –0·56, 
–0·66 to –0·45 for atomoxetine). By contrast, for available comparisons based on teachers’ ratings, only methylphenidate 
(SMD –0·82, 95% CI –1·16 to –0·48) and modafinil (–0·76, –1·15 to –0·37) were more efficacious than placebo. In 
adults (clinicians’ ratings), amphetamines (SMD –0·79, 95% CI –0·99 to –0·58), methylphenidate (–0·49, 
–0·64 to –0·35), bupropion (–0·46, –0·85 to –0·07), and atomoxetine (–0·45, –0·58 to –0·32), but not modafinil (0·16, 
–0·28 to 0·59), were better than placebo. With respect to tolerability, amphetamines were inferior to placebo in both 
children and adolescents (odds ratio [OR] 2·30, 95% CI 1·36–3·89) and adults (3·26, 1·54–6·92); guanfacine was 
inferior to placebo in children and adolescents only (2·64, 1·20–5·81); and atomoxetine (2·33, 1·28–4·25), 
methylphenidate (2·39, 1·40–4·08), and modafinil (4·01, 1·42–11·33) were less well tolerated than placebo in adults 
only. In head-to-head comparisons, only differences in efficacy (clinicians’ ratings) were found, favouring amphetamines 
over modafinil, atomoxetine, and methylphenidate in both children and adolescents (SMDs –0·46 to –0·24) and adults 
(–0·94 to –0·29). We did not find sufficient data for the 26-week and 52-week timepoints.
Interpretation Our findings represent the most comprehensive available evidence base to inform patients, families, 
clinicians, guideline developers, and policymakers on the choice of ADHD medications across age groups. Taking 
into account both efficacy and safety, evidence from this meta-analysis supports methylphenidate in children and 
adolescents, and amphetamines in adults, as preferred first-choice medications for the short-term treatment of 
ADHD. New research should be funded urgently to assess long-term effects of these drugs.

Introduction
Attention-deficit 
hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD) 
is 
characterised by age-inappropriate and impairing levels of 
inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, or a combination.1 
It is estimated to affect around 5% of school-age children 
(aged ≤18 years)2 and 2·5% of adults worldwide.3 Annual 
incremental costs for ADHD have been estimated at 
US$143–266 billion in the USA4 and are substantial in 
other countries.5,6 Available pharmacological treatments 
for ADHD include psychostimulants (eg, methylphenidate 
and amphetamines) and non-psychostimulant medica-
tions (eg, atomoxetine and α2-agonists). In the past few 
decades, prescriptions for ADHD drugs have increased 
significantly both in the USA7 and other countries.8 
However, even though recommended in clinical guide-
lines,9–14 the efficacy and safety of ADHD medications 
remains controversial.15–17 Furthermore, current guidelines 
are inconsistent in their treatment recommendations.9–14 
Although some guidelines rank methylphenidate over 
amphetamines (eg, in children),9 others recommend 
psychostimulants as first-line treatment without any 
distinction between methylphenidate and amphetamines 
being made.10,11 Additionally, the non-psychostimulant 
atomoxetine is variously recommended by available 
guidelines as third-line,9 second-line,10,11 and potentially 
first-line treatment.12 The methods used for sequencing 
these recommendations are not always specified and most 
commonly—including the 2018 UK National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines9—
incorporate national drug licencing regulatory approval 
and cost-effectiveness with expert opinion in conjunction 
with the few head-to-head comparisons that are available.
Network meta-analyses facilitate estimation of the 
comparative efficacy and tolerability of two or more 
interventions, even when they have not been investigated 
head-to-head in randomised controlled trials.18 Thus, 
compared with standard pairwise meta-analyses, network 
meta-analyses have been found to increase the precision

Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, ERIC (Education 
Resources Information Center), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, 
Web of Science Core Collection, ProQuest Dissertations and 
Theses (UK and Ireland), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses 
(Abstracts and International), and the WHO International Trials 
Registry Platform (including ClinicalTrials.gov) from database 
inception up to April 7, 2017, with no restrictions by language, 
for published and unpublished double-blind randomised 
controlled trials comparing amphetamines (including 
lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, 
guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with each other or 
placebo. We used the search terms: “adhd” OR “hkd” OR “addh” 
OR “hyperkine*” OR “attention deficit*” OR “hyper-activ*” OR 
“hyperactiv*” OR “overactive” OR “inattentive” OR “impulsiv*”, 
combined with a list of ADHD medications (appendix pp 3–15). 
We also hand-searched the websites of the US Food and Drug 
Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and relevant 
drug manufacturers, and references of previous systematic 
reviews and guidelines, for additional information. Further, 
we contacted study authors and drug manufacturers to gather 
unpublished information or data. Over the past few decades, 
a substantial increase has been noted across many countries in 
prescription of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD). However, the benefits and safety of these 
medications remain a matter for debate. Published 
meta-analyses of head-to-head trials and network 
meta-analyses provide inconsistent findings on the 
comparative benefits and harms of ADHD medications.
Added value of this study
Our study, based on advanced methodology for network 
meta-analyses, represents the most comprehensive synthesis 
to date on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 
medications for ADHD across age groups. Unlike previous 
network meta-analyses of ADHD treatments, we have included 
unpublished data, which were gathered systematically from 
study authors, the websites of regulatory agencies, and drug 
manufacturers, using a common set of inclusion criteria for 
trials in children, adolescents, and adults. We focused on a series 
of clinically relevant outcomes—namely, efficacy on ADHD core 
symptoms, global clinical functioning, tolerability, effects on 
weight and blood pressure, and acceptability. We also 
investigated important effect-modifiers (eg, dose and 
comorbidities). We retained only a few studies with outcomes 
beyond 12 weeks. All medications we included in our study 
(except modafinil in adults) were more efficacious than placebo 
for the acute treatment of ADHD. Medications for ADHD were 
less efficacious and less well tolerated in adults than in children 
and adolescents. However, included drugs were not equivalent, 
and their profile in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and 
acceptability varied across age groups.
Implications of all the available evidence
Evidence from our network meta-analysis supports 
methylphenidate (in children and adolescents) and 
amphetamines (in adults) as the preferred first pharmacological 
choice for short-term pharmacological treatment of ADHD. 
This network meta-analysis should inform future guidelines 
and daily clinical decision-making on the choice of medications 
for ADHD across age ranges, along with available evidence on 
cost-effectiveness and considering patients’ preferences. 
The paucity of trials with randomised outcomes beyond 
12 weeks highlights the need to fund studies to assess 
long-term effects of these drugs. Furthermore, future research 
should include individual patient data in network 
meta-analyses of ADHD medications, which will allow a more 
reliable estimation of predictors of individual response.

of the estimates.18 Previous network meta-analyses in 
ADHD have focused on either children and adole 
s-
cents19–24 or adults only,25–28 have typically compared only a 
few drugs,24,25,27,29 or have addressed exclusively the safety 
of treatments.26
To fill this gap, we did a systematic review and network 
meta-analysis of double-blind randomised controlled 
trials in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD, 
using data from published reports and unpublished data 
gathered systematically from drug manufacturers or 
study authors. We aimed specifically to compare ADHD 
medications in terms of efficacy on core ADHD symp-
toms, clinical global functioning, tolerability, accept-
ability, and other clinically important outcomes—eg, 
blood pressure and weight changes.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We searched PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, 
ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, Web of Science 
Core Collection, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (UK 
and Ireland), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (abstracts 
and international), and the WHO International Trials 
Registry Platform, including ClinicalTrials.gov, from the 
date of database inception to April 7, 2017, with no language 
restrictions. We used the search terms “adhd” OR “hkd” 
OR “addh” OR “hyperkine*” OR “attention deficit*” OR 
“hyper-activ*” OR “hyperactiv*” OR “overactive” OR 
“inattentive” OR “impulsiv*” combined with a list of 
ADHD medications (appendix pp 3–15). The US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency 
(EMA), and relevant drug manufact 
urers’ websites, and 
references of previous systematic reviews and guidelines, 
were hand-searched for additional information. We also 
contacted study authors and drug manufacturers to gather 
unpublished information and data (appendix p 15).
We included double-blind randomised controlled trials 
(parallel group, crossover, or cluster), of at least 1 week’s 
duration, that enrolled children (aged ≥5 years and 
<12 years), adolescents (aged ≥12 years and <18 years), or 
adults (≥18 years) with a primary diagnosis of ADHD 
according to DSM-III, DSM III-R, DSM-IV(TR), DSM-5, 
ICD-9, or ICD-10. We did not restrict our search by ADHD 
subtype or presentation, gender, intelligence quotient (IQ), 
socioeconomic status, or comorbidities (except for those 
needing concomitant pharmacotherapy). We included 
studies if they assessed any of the following medications, 
as oral monotherapy, compared with each other or with 
placebo: amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), 
atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methyl-
phenidate (including dexmethylphenidate), and modafinil. 
We excluded studies with enrichment designs (eg, trials 
selecting drug responders only after a run-in phase), 
because these types of trial can potentially inflate efficacy 
and tolerability estimates. Full inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are in the appendix (pp 16, 17).
Our study protocol was registered with PROSPERO 
(number CRD42014008976) and published.30 We followed 
the PRISMA extension for network meta-analyses.31
Procedures
Data were extracted by at least two independent 
investigators. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane 
risk of bias tool.32 We estimated the certainty of evidence 
with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for 
network meta-analyses (appendix pp 18, 19).33
Outcomes
For our primary analyses we considered efficacy, which 
we measured as the change in severity of ADHD core 
symptoms based on clinicians’ ratings for children, 
adolescents, and adults. The appendix (pp 273, 274) 
contains a list of rating scales considered for inclusion. 
For children and adolescents, we also considered teachers’ 
ratings as a primary efficacy outcome because they 
provide a complementary view to clinicians’ ratings, and 
information from multiple raters increases the validity of 
ADHD diagnosis.34 We also considered tolerability in 
children, adolescents, and adults—ie, the proportion of 
participants who left the study because of any side-effect.
Secondary outcomes included the change in severity of 
ADHD core symptoms based on parents’ ratings for children 
and adolescents and self-reports for adults, clinical global 
functioning measured by the Clinical Global Impression–
Improvement (CGI-I, clinicians’ ratings), acceptability 
(ie, the proportion of participants who left the study for 
any reason), and change in weight and blood pressure. 
We assessed those outcomes available at the times closest 
to 12 weeks (primary endpoint), 26 weeks, and 52 weeks.

Statistical analysis
We did all analyses separately for studies in children and 
adolescents and for studies in adults. First, we did 
pairwise meta-analyses (active drug vs placebo, or active 
drug vs another active drug) for all outcomes and 
comparisons at every available timepoint, using a 
random-effects model.35 We calculated standardised 
mean differences (SMDs), Hedges’s adjusted g, and odds 
ratios (ORs), with relative 95% CIs, for continuous and 
dichotomous outcomes. We assessed statistical hetero-
geneity within each pairwise comparison by calculating 
the I² statistic and its 95% CI.36 Second, we did network 
meta-analyses within a frequentist frame 
work assuming 
equal heterogeneity parameter τ across all comparisons 
and accounting for correlations induced by multiarm 
studies.37,38 We based the assessment of statistical 
heterogeneity in the entire network on the magnitude of 
the common τ² estimated from the network meta-
analysis models.39 We compared the magnitude of the 
heterogeneity variance with the empirical distrib 
ution.40,41 
We used the loop-specific approach42 and the design-by-
treatment model43 to evaluate incoherence locally and 
globally, respectively. We established a hierarchy of 
competing interventions using surface under the 
cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and mean ranks.44
We planned a set of subgroup and sensitivity analyses 
to assess the effect of clinical and study design effect-
modifiers—eg, duration of study, gender, age (children vs 
adolescents), psychiatric comorbidities, IQ, crossover 
design, medication status, industry sponsorship, inequal-
i 
ties in doses, risk of bias, and data imputation.30 
We restricted the primary analysis to studies using 
medications within the therapeutic range (as per FDA 
recommendations, where applicable). Additionally, we 
investigated effects at different dose regimens in two sets 
of sensitivity analyses. First, we excluded studies that did 
not use the FDA-licensed dose (appendix pp 277–79). 
Second, we included studies in which the dose ranges 
used were recommended in national or international 
guidelines or formularies but differed from FDA recom-
mendations. Finally, to investigate possible differences 
between lisdexamfetamine and other amphetamines, we 
did a post-hoc analysis separating this compound, 
because lisdexamfetamine is metabolised differently 
from other amphetamines, which could affect its efficacy 
and tolerability.45
We did all analyses with STATA version 14. Additional 
details are reported in the appendix (pp 20–24, 277–82). 
Changes to the original protocol are listed in the 
appendix (p 25).
Role of the funding source
The funder had no role in study design, data collection, 
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. 
SCo, NA, CDG, and AC had full access to all data in the 
study, and AC was responsible for the final decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
The literature search, study selection, and data extraction 
were done between Jan 11, 2014, and Sept 9, 2017, and data 
analysis was done from Sept 10, 2017, to Feb 24, 2018. The 
study selection process is shown in figure 1; a list of 
excluded studies, with reasons for exclusion, and a list 
of retained studies is provided in the appendix (pp 26–272). 
133 studies were retained for the network meta-analysis, 
81 in children and adolescents, 51 in adults, and 
one including children, adolescents, and adults. In total, 
14 346 children and adolescents and 10 296 adults were 
included. For 83% of studies, additional data and 
information not reported in the full-text paper were used. 
Figure 2: Network of eligible comparisons for efficacy and tolerability
The width of the lines is proportional to the number of trials comparing every pair of treatments, and the size of 
every circle is proportional to the number of randomly assigned participants (sample size). The number of trials for 
pairs of treatments ranged from 22 (eg, studies of tolerability of methylphenidate vs placebo in children and 
adolescents) to one (several comparisons).

The appendix (pp 283–381) reports the main characteristics 
of included studies. The risk of bias was rated overall low in 
23·5% of studies in children and adolescents, unclear in 
65·4%, and high in 11·1%. The risk of bias was overall low 
in 27·5% of studies in adults, unclear in 56·8%, and high 
in 15·7% (appendix pp 382–458).
Figure 2 shows the network plots for the primary 
outcomes closest to 12 weeks. Network plots for secondary 
outcomes are reported in the appendix (pp 624–29). 
Results of the pairwise meta-analyses and related 
heterogeneity are reported in the appendix (pp 459–71). 
Results of the network meta-analyses of primary 
outcomes at 12 weeks are shown in figure 3, tables 1 and 2, 
and the appendix (pp 472, 473). Tables 1 and 2 also show 
the confidence of estimates for every comparison. 
Figure 4 summarises data for efficacy (in 10 068 children 
and adolescents and 8131 adults) and tolerability (in 
11 018 children and adolescents and 5362 adults).
With respect to ADHD core symptoms rated by 
clinicians in children and adolescents, all drugs were 
superior to placebo (figure 3, table 1). In adults, 
amphetamines, methylphenidate, bupropion, and ato-
moxe 
tine were superior to placebo, but modafinil was 
not superior to placebo; no data were available for

guanfacine and clonidine. In children, adolescents, and 
adults, amphetamines were significantly superior to 
modafinil, atomoxetine, and methylphenidate (table 1). 
Additionally, in children and adolescents, amphetamines 
were superior to guanfacine and methylphenidate was 
superior to atomoxetine. In adults, methylphenidate, 
atomoxetine, and bupropion were superior to modafinil. 
By contrast, according to teachers’ ratings of children’s 
ADHD core symptoms, only methylphenidate and 
modafinil were superior to placebo (no data were 
available for amphetamines and clonidine; table 1).
With respect to tolerability, in children and adolescents, 
only guanfacine and amphetamines were less well 
tolerated than placebo (figure 3, table 2). In adults, 
modafinil, amphetamines, methylphenidate, and ato-
moxetine were inferior to placebo (no data were available 
for guanfacine and clonidine). No differences in tolerability 
were noted between active drugs, in children, adolescents, 
and adults.
In children and adolescents, the common heterogeneity 
SD for efficacy (teachers’ and clinicians’ ratings) and 
tolerability was 0·355, 0·188, and 0·268, respectively. In 
adults, the common heterogeneity SD for efficacy rated 
by clinicians and tolerability was 0·178 and 0·282, 
respectively. The test of global inconsistency did not 
show any significant difference for the primary outcomes. 
Additional details are reported in the appendix (p 474).
Parents’ ratings of their child’s ADHD core symptoms 
and adults’ self-ratings of their own ADHD core symptoms, 
with respect to efficacy of active drugs versus placebo, were 
similar to clinicians’ ratings. Exceptions were guanfacine, 
which was not superior to placebo according to parents’ 
ratings (SMD –0·23, 95% CI –0·90 to 0·45), and 
bupropion, which was not superior to placebo with respect 
to parents’ ratings (0·24, –0·44 to 0·92) and adults’ self-
reports (–0·30, –0·61 to 0·01; appendix pp 475–76).
In children and adolescents, all compounds were 
superior to placebo on the CGI-I scale, except for clonidine 
(OR 2·78, 95% CI 0·91–8·53). In adults, amphetamines 
(4·86, 3·30–7·17), bupropion (3·43, 1·45–8·14), and 
methylphenidate (3·08, 2·04–4·65) were superior to 
placebo on the CGI-I scale (appendix p 476).
Weight was decreased significantly by amphetamines (in 
children and adolescents, SMD –0·71, 95% CI –1·15 to –0·27; 
in adults, –0·60, –1·03 to –0·18), methylphenidate (in 
children and adolescents, –0·77, –1·09 to –0·45; in adults, 
–0·74, –1·20 to –0·28), atomoxetine (in children and 
adolescents, –0·84, –1·16 to –0·52), and modafinil (in 
children and adolescents, –0·93, –1·59 to –0·26), compared 
with placebo (appendix pp 476, 477). Systolic blood pressure 
was increased with use of amphetamines (SMD 0·09, 
95% CI 0·01–0·18) and atomoxetine (0·12, 0·02–0·22) in 
children and adolescents, and with use of methylphenidate 
(0·17, 0·05–0·30) in adults, compared with placebo 
(appendix p 477). Use of amphetamines (0·21, 0·12–0·31), 
atomoxetine (0·28, 0·18–0·37), and methylphenidate (0·24, 
0·14–0·33) in children and adults, and atomoxetine (0·19, 
0·08–0·30) and methylphenidate (0·20, 0·08–0·32) in 
adults, significantly increased diastolic blood pressure 
compared with placebo (appendix p 478).

For acceptability, compared with placebo, methyl-
phenidate (OR 0·69, 95% CI 0·52–0·91) in children and 
adolescents and amphetamines (0·68, 0·49–0·95) in 
adults were significantly better (appendix p 478).
In subgroup and sensitivity analyses, data were 
sufficient to assess the effect of study length, 
comorbidities, IQ, crossover design, unfair dose 
comparisons, and data imputation. Findings of these 
analyses were generally robust (appendix pp 479–91). 
Because of a paucity of data, we could not assess the effect 
of gender, age (children vs adolescents), low risk of bias, 
medication status, and industry sponsorship. Sensitivity 
analyses investigating the effect of different maximum 
doses confirmed the results of the primary dose analysis 
(appendix pp 492–575).
Post-hoc analyses separating lisdexamfetamine from 
other amphetamines highlighted some differences. In 
children, lisdexamfetamine was less well tolerated 
compared with placebo (OR 2·69, 95% CI 1·40–5·16), 
whereas tolerability of the other amphetamines was 
slightly better (1·83, 0·84–4·02); in adults, the opposite 
pattern emerged (vs placebo: lisdexamfetamine, 2·74, 
0·80–9·30; other amphetamines, 3·66, 1·36–9·87). 
Network meta-analyses heterogeneity for the dose 
and post-hoc analyses are reported in the appendix 
(pp 576–78).
Data for network meta-analyses inconsistency and 
SUCRA and mean rank are reported in the appendix 
(pp 579–85). Empirical heterogeneity variance for 
continuous outcomes for drug versus placebo compar-
isons was 0·05 (50% percentile) and 0·24 (75% percentile); 
for binary outcomes it was 0·12 (50% percentile) and 
0·34 (75% percentile). Funnel plots are shown in the 
appendix (pp 630–32). We retained only a few studies—all 
in adults—with reported outcomes closest to 26 weeks or 
52 weeks (appendix pp 586–88); therefore results for 
outcomes at these timepoints were deemed not 
informative.
Of 42 mixed comparisons (ie, combining direct and 
indirect evidence), the confidence in estimate for primary 
outcome comparisons was rated as very low in 
13 comparisons, low in 18, moderate in ten, and high 
in one. Of 59 indirect comparisons, the confidence in 
estimate was very low in 37 comparisons, low in 20, and 
moderate in two (appendix pp 589–623, 633–43).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, our network meta-analysis 
represents 
the 
most 
comprehensive 
comparative 
synthesis to date on the efficacy and tolerability of 
medications for children, adolescents, and adults with 
ADHD. We have addressed the limitations of previous 
network meta-analyses, which focused selectively on 
children and adolescents19–24 or adults,25–28 or included 
only published material,21–24,26 non-blinded trials,19,21–24 or 
non-core ADHD outcomes.19,22,25,28
Overall, all medications, except modafinil in adults, were 
more efficacious than placebo for the short-term treatment 
of ADHD, and they were less efficacious and less well 
tolerated in adults than in children and adolescents. 
However, the included medications were not equivalent in 
relation to their mean effect size, which ranged from 
moderate to high and varied according to the type of rater. 
Furthermore, even though amphetamines were the most 
efficacious compounds in children, adolescents, and 
adults, the effects of medications varied across age groups 
for several outcomes. With respect to tolerability, in 
children, only amphetamines and guanfacine were 
less well tolerated than placebo, whereas in adults, 
methylphenidate, amphetamines, and atomoxetine were

worse than placebo. Additionally, amphet 
amines signif-
icantly increased diastolic blood pressure in children and 
adolescents, but not in adults. In children and adolescents, 
methylphenidate was the only drug with better acceptability 
than placebo; in adults, amphetamines were the only 
compound with better acceptability than placebo. 
Atomoxetine had the lowest mean effect size in children 
and adolescents based on clinicians’ ratings, but in adults, 
its efficacy on ADHD core symptoms was comparable 
with that of methylphenidate. The large confidence interval 
in relation to the efficacy and tolerability of bupropion, 
clonidine, guanfacine, and modafinil suggests that caution 
should be used when interpreting these data. Another 
relevant finding, which requires replication in head-to-
head trials, is the absence of significant differences 
between amphetamines and methylphenidate on the 
CGI-I measure.
Accounting for all included outcomes, our results 
support methylphenidate in children and adolescents, 
and amphetamines in adults, as the first pharmacological 
choice for ADHD. In fact, in adults, amphetamines were 
not only the most efficacious compounds, as rated by 
clinicians and by self-report, but also as well tolerated as 
methylphenidate and the only compounds with better 
acceptability than placebo. In children and adolescents, 
even though amphetamines were marginally superior 
to methylphenidate according to clinicians’ ratings, 
methylphenidate was the only compound with better 
acceptability than placebo and, unlike amphetamines, 
was not worse than placebo in terms of tolerability. 
Additionally, our results on secondary outcomes high-
light the importance of monitoring weight and blood 
pressure changes with atomoxetine as much as with 
stimulants.
Our conclusions from this analysis concur partly with 
NICE 
guidelines,9 
in 
which 
methylphenidate 
is 
recommended as the first choice in children and 
adolescents and methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine as 
first choice in adults. Additionally, although NICE 
recommend atomoxetine or guanfacine as a possible 
third-line choice in children, our results suggest that, 
despite comparable efficacy on ADHD core symptoms 
rated by parents, atomoxetine was equal to placebo in 
terms of tolerability, whereas guanfacine was worse. 
However, it is noteworthy that the NICE recommendations 
were informed not only by empirical evidence but also by 
considerations on costs and licence and flexibility of 
formulations.
Although post-hoc analyses did indicate differences 
between the amphetamine prodrug lisdexamfetamine and 
other amphetamines, the few studies that we were 
able to include in this comparison (four studies of 
lisdexamfetamine in children and adolescents and one of 
amphetamines; and two studies of lisdexamfetamine in 
adults and one of amphetamines) prevent us from drawing 
any firm conclusions from these findings. We would, 
therefore, not feel confident at this stage to recommend 
lisdexamfetamine over the other amphetamines for adults, 
as was suggested by NICE, although based on UK costs.9
An important factor to consider in the interpretation of 
our findings is the medication dose. There is considerable 
interindividual variation in terms of most effective dose. 
In general, we found no substantial differences in either 
efficacy or tolerability across the various medications 
when the maximum dose allowed was the dose defined 
by the FDA or by guidelines (suggesting in general 
higher maximum doses than the FDA). We excluded 
some studies9,46,47 because they included doses higher 
than those recommended in available guidelines, thus 
poorly reflecting common clinical practice. It is possible 
that inclusion of these studies would have changed the 
efficacy and tolerability results.
In general, results for the primary outcomes were 
robust in our sensitivity analyses, suggesting that trials 
of short duration (<3 weeks), presence of psychiatric 
comorbidities, low IQ as an inclusion criterion, dose 
comparisons that we judged unfair, crossover design, 
and missing data imputation did not significantly affect 
the results.
Our study has some limitations. Although we did our 
best to include all available trials and retrieve unpublished 
data, we cannot rule out the possibility of missing 
information. The latest update of studies included in the 
network meta-analysis was in April, 2017
. We did a 
PubMed search in May, 2018, and found only three 
additional studies that met our inclusion critieria.48–50 
Since we already had 133 included studies, we decided 
that adding these three studies would not have changed 
the final results materially. Additionally, some nodes in 
our network included only few studies. To adhere to the 
assumption of transitivity and reduce the risk of biased 
estimates (for instance, those that included enrichment 
designs), we had to discard many studies that were initially 
selected as potentially relevant (appendix pp 26–235). 
Most included studies compared an active drug with 
placebo and the number of actual head-to-head trials was 
quite small, so comparative efficacy between interventions 
was frequently based on indirect comparisons.
We found significant statistical heterogeneity in the 
pairwise meta-analyses, and the study population in our 
review included participants with different previous 
exposures and responses to ADHD medications. These 
characteristics were quite evenly distributed across the 
included studies and across the different nodes in the 
network, therefore, even if they contributed to statistical 
heterogeneity, it is unlikely that they have implications 
in terms of clinical heterogeneity and affected the 
validity of our results. On the contrary, heterogeneity can 
be seen as increasing the external validity of our findings, 
because the patients seen in real-world clinical practice 
tend to have similar variations. Although we included 
studies that used different rating scales to assess the 
core symptoms of ADHD, we selected carefully only 
validated scales that measure exclusively the same

triad of symptoms—ie, inattention, hyperactivity, and 
impulsivity.
Our results should also consider the risk of bias of 
individual studies and GRADE quality ratings. After 
gathering additional unpublished information, the overall 
number of unclear items—across all items of the risk of 
bias—decreased from 63·5% to 35·2%. This reduction 
points to an urgent need for complete and open reporting 
in this research area. Additionally, the confidence of 
estimate for primary outcomes was low or very low in 
multiple comparisons, reducing the certainty of the 
findings. Most very low ratings were for indirect 
comparisons, suggesting the need for additional well 
designed 
head-to-head 
studies. 
Whereas 
previous 
pairwise16,51 or network meta-analyses19 of ADHD 
medications rated all comparisons as low or very low 
quality, attributable in part to unpublished information 
that we gathered and a more nuanced assessment, we 
could rate some comparisons as high or moderate quality. 
Of note, these comparisons included the most commonly 
used drugs for ADHD (ie, methylphenidate and 
amphetamines). Additionally, our stringent criteria for 
the risk of bias (ie, a study was assessed at overall low risk 
only when all individual items were at low risk) could 
have contributed to downgrade the final GRADE ratings.
We planned to do analyses for outcomes closest to 
12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks, but few data were 
available for 26 weeks and 52 weeks and analyses at these 
timepoints were, therefore, not possible. This scarcity of 
data reflects ethical issues associated with doing long-
term, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials of 
effective treatments. Thus, our findings can inform only 
the choice of short-term medication treatment for 
ADHD. Moreover, because of a paucity of data, we were 
unable to properly undertake all the planned sensitivity 
analyses. Finally, we did not include studies of 
antipsychotic or tricyclic antidepressant compounds 
because, although commonly prescribed for patients 
with ADHD, they are not used routinely to treat ADHD 
core symptoms, and their inclusion would, therefore, 
violate the assumption of transitivity in the networks.
Notwithstanding these caveats, our findings represent 
the best currently available evidence base (not constrained 
by local costs and licencing) to inform future guidelines 
internationally and shared decision-making between 
patients, carers, and clinicians, when a balance has to be 
made between efficacy and tolerability of ADHD 
medications.
