IMPORTANCE Lung cancer has become a leading cause of death among people living with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH). Over 40% of PLWH in the United States
smoke cigarettes; HIV independently increases the risk of lung cancer.
OBJECTIVE To project cumulative lung cancer mortality by smoking exposure among PLWH
in care.
DESIGN Using a validated microsimulation model of HIV, we applied standard demographic
data and recent HIV/AIDS epidemiology statistics with specific details on smoking exposure,
combining smoking status (current, former, or never) and intensity (heavy, moderate, or
light). We stratified reported mortality rates attributable to lung cancer and other
non–AIDS-related causes by smoking exposure and accounted for an HIV-conferred
independent risk of lung cancer. Lung cancer mortality risk ratios (vs never smokers) for male
and female current moderate smokers were 23.6 and 24.2, respectively, and for those who
quit smoking at age 40 years were 4.3 and 4.5. In sensitivity analyses, we accounted for
nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and for a range of HIV-conferred risks of death
from lung cancer and from other non–AIDS-related diseases (eg, cardiovascular disease).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cumulative lung cancer mortality by age 80 years
(stratified by sex, age at entry to HIV care, and smoking exposure); total expected lung cancer
deaths, accounting for nonadherence to ART.
RESULTS Among 40-year-old men with HIV, estimated cumulative lung cancer mortality for
heavy, moderate, and light smokers who continued to smoke was 28.9%, 23.0%, and 18.8%,
respectively; for those who quit smoking at age 40 years, it was 7.9%, 6.1%, and 4.3%; and
for never smokers, it was 1.6%. Among women, the corresponding mortality for current
smokers was 27.8%, 20.9%, and 16.6%; for former smokers, it was 7.5%, 5.2%, and 3.7%;
and for never smokers, it was 1.2%. ART-adherent individuals who continued to smoke were
6 to 13 times more likely to die from lung cancer than from traditional AIDS-related causes,
depending on sex and smoking intensity. Due to greater AIDS-related mortality risks,
individuals with incomplete ART adherence had higher overall mortality but lower lung cancer
mortality. Applying model projections to the approximately 644 200 PLWH aged 20 to 64 in
care in the United States, 59 900 (9.3%) are expected to die from lung cancer if smoking
habits do not change.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Those PLWH who adhere to ART but smoke are substantially
more likely to die from lung cancer than from AIDS-related causes.

ntiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically
improved the life expectancy of people living with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH), with
a concomitant shift in morbidity and mortality from AIDS to
non-AIDS diseases.1,2 Much of the non-AIDS disease burden
is tobacco-related. Over 40% of PLWH in the United States
smoke cigarettes, more than double the smoking prevalence
in the general population.3-7 Among PLWH undergoing ART,
smoking now reduces life expectancy more than HIV
itself.8-10
Tobacco use and HIV together may accelerate the devel-
opment of lung cancer.11-14 The risk of lung cancer is
increased by the presence of HIV through mechanisms likely
involving chronic inflammation, immunomodulation, and
other infections.11,15-19 Lung cancer is the leading cause of
cancer death among PLWH undergoing ART and is among
the leading causes of death overall in this population.13,20
Despite the high smoking prevalence and the risk of lung
cancer and other tobacco-related diseases, smoking cessa-
tion programs generally have not been successfully imple-
mented in HIV care. As the population of PLWH in the
United States ages, estimates of projected comorbidities can
help guide where to direct attention and resources in HIV
care. We sought to understand the likely impact of smoking
cessation on lung cancer mortality among PLWH in HIV care
in the United States. We compared the risk of lung cancer
death against the risks of death from other causes as a func-
tion of smoking exposure.
Methods
Analytic Overview
We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Compli-
cations (CEPAC)-US model, a validated, widely published
Monte Carlo microsimulation of HIV disease and
treatment.10,21-23 After populating the model with published
data, we projected lung cancer mortality among PLWH in HIV
care according to smoking exposure. We defined smoking ex-
posure by both smoking status (current, former, or never) and,
for current and former smokers, intensity (heavy, moderate,
or light) based on number of cigarettes per day. We accounted
for competing risks of death from AIDS-related and non–AIDS-
related causes, the latter stratified by smoking exposure. We
modeled cohorts of 1 million men or women of a particular
smoking exposure entering HIV care at a specific age (eg, 30,
40, or 50 years).
The primary outcome was cumulative lung cancer mor-
tality by age 80 years. We combined the model-generated es-
timates with published epidemiologic data to project the total
expectedlungcancerdeathsamongPLWHincareintheUnited
States.
Model Overview
For this analysis, an individual enters the model at the time
of linkage to HIV care and is followed until death or age 80
years, whichever comes first. The model draws randomly
from user-defined initial distributions of CD4 count and HIV
RNA and tracks clinical outcomes as an individual transi-
tions monthly through states of disease progression and
treatment. Probabilities of transition between HIV-related
health states depend on factors including current CD4 count
and HIV RNA. All individuals are ART eligible, regardless of
CD4 count.24 An individual may die from an AIDS-related
cause (opportunistic infection or chronic AIDS-related dis-
ease), lung cancer, or another non–AIDS-related cause (eg,
cardiovascular disease; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Model
details are available at http://www.massgeneral.org/mpec
/cepac/.
Cohort Stratifications
We simulated cohorts stratified by sex, age at entry to HIV
care, and smoking exposure (eg, current moderate smokers,
former heavy smokers). We assumed no change in smoking
status or intensity stratification over time. Former smokers
are stratified by past smoking intensity. Within each cohort
of former smokers, all individuals stop smoking at the same
age (at entry to HIV care, except in sensitivity analysis, in
which they quit later) and remain abstinent. We did not
evaluate those who had quit smoking before entering HIV
care.
Lung Cancer Mortality
We derived lung cancer mortality probabilities by sex, age, and
smokingexposure.Forcurrentsmokers,risksdependonsmok-
ing intensity. At the time of quitting smoking, risks decrease
to those of former smokers and depend on age at cessation and
prior smoking intensity.
Lung Cancer–Deleted, Non–AIDS-Related Mortality
We applied probabilities of non–AIDS-related death from all
causes besides lung cancer (eg, other cancers, cardiovascular
disease) by sex, age, and smoking exposure. Risks for current
and former smokers are stratified in a similar manner to lung
cancer risks. We additionally stratified former smokers’risks
by years since cessation, in accordance with available data.25
Antiretroviral Therapy and HIV Care
In the pre-ART era, smoking was not an important driver of
mortality among PLWH.26 Untreated individuals were un-
Key Points
Question What is the risk of lung cancer death by smoking
exposure for a person living with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)?
Findings In this microsimulation model–based analysis,
cumulative lung cancer mortality by age 80 years for men and
women who entered HIV care in the United States at age 40 years
and continued to smoke an average number of cigarettes daily was
23.0% and 20.9%, respectively; if they quit smoking, the
respective risks decreased to 6.1% and 5.2%. Those who
continued to smoke were 6 to 13 times more likely to die from lung
cancer than from traditional AIDS-related causes.
Meaning Smoking cessation should be a priority in the care of
people living with HIV.

 likely to survive long enough to develop lung cancer. Recog-
nizing that smoking emerges as an important competing risk
in the presence of virologic suppression, we assumed, in the
base case, complete ART adherence and no loss to follow-up
from HIV care. These in-care individuals are more likely to par-
ticipate in a smoking cessation intervention. In sensitivity
analysis, we relaxed this assumption, accounting for re-
ported rates of ART nonadherence and loss to follow-up
(Supplement).27 Additional specifications are described
elsewhere.23,27
Model Validation
Therearefewpublisheddataonsmoking-relatedmortalityspe-
cific to PLWH. We therefore pursued 2 validation strategies.
First, we compared our model-generated cumulative lung can-
cer mortality among HIV-uninfected people to results re-
ported in general population studies in Western Europe.28,29
Second, we compared our model-generated cumulative lung
cancer mortality among PLWH (accounting for ART nonad-
herence and loss to follow-up) with the modeled cumulative
lung cancer incidence reported by the North American AIDS
Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD)
(Supplement).30,31
Input Parameters
Cohort Characteristics
We simulated PLWH reflecting those initiating HIV care in the
UnitedStates25,32-39(Table1andSupplement).Inthebasecase,
weassumedthesameCD4distributionregardlessofcohortage
at entry to care.
Cohort Stratifications by Smoking Exposure
Smoking intensity for current and former smokers was based
on number of cigarettes per day as derived by Rosenberg et
al,25 who categorized US smokers into quintiles of cigarettes
per day stratified by sex, age, and 5-year birth cohort,
through the year 2000.25 Among current and former smok-
ers, we considered the fifth, third, and first quintiles to be
heavy, moderate, and light smokers. For example, among
40-year-old men, heavy, moderate, and light smokers con-
sumed 35, 18, and 2 cigarettes per day, respectively (Table 1).
These quantities changed with age according to published
data (Supplement).25
Lung Cancer Mortality
To derive monthly lung cancer mortality by smoking expo-
sure, we combined US general population data on lung can-
cer mortality rates in 2000 (to match the latest year of the
lung cancer–deleted life tables25), lung cancer mortality risk
ratios for current and former smokers (further stratified by
smoking intensity) vs never smokers, and the proportions of
current, former, and never smokers in the population
(Supplement).25,36,40-42 Compared with never smokers, the
lung cancer mortality risk ratio for male and female current
moderate smokers was 23.6 and 24.2, respectively, and for
those who quit at age 40 years, it was 4.3 and 4.5.
The derived smoking exposure-stratified lung cancer
rates were not specific to PLWH. Therefore, in the base case,
we accounted for an HIV-associated independent risk of lung
cancer by multiplying the derived rates by 1.7. This was the
multivariable-adjusted risk ratio (PLWH vs HIV-uninfected
people) reported by the Veterans Aging Cohort Study,11
the largest study of the association between HIV and lung
cancer.
Lung Cancer–Deleted, Non–AIDS-Related Mortality
We applied lung cancer–deleted, non–AIDS-related mortality
probabilities (eg, from other cancers and cardiovascular dis-
ease) based on published lung cancer–deleted life tables
through 2000 (Supplement).25 Mortality risks were stratified
by sex, age, and smoking exposure. In the base case, we as-
sumed no HIV-associated increase in these causes of death. We
did not specify the cause of death within this group; esti-
mates would have been inaccurate owing to the absence of
many cause-deleted life tables.
Sensitivity Analysis
To understand the robustness of our findings under param-
eter uncertainty, we performed sensitivity analyses with
alternative assumptions and parameter estimates. These
included (1) accounting for reported rates of ART nonadher-
ence and loss to follow-up from HIV care, which increase
AIDS-related death risk; (2) varying the HIV-associated risk
ratio for lung cancer from 1.0 to 1.911; (3) varying initial CD4
count at entry to HIV care, which affects AIDS-related death
risk; and (4) varying when former smokers quit: 10 or 20
years after entering HIV care, rather than at the time of
entering care.
Our base case did not include a link between HIV and other
non–AIDS-related causes of death (besides lung cancer). This
reflectedtheinconsistencyofreportedsmoking-adjusted,HIV-
associated risks of death from these causes. However, we con-
ducted an additional sensitivity analysis using a multiplica-
tive risk factor of 1.7 to increase the independent effect of HIV
onothernon–AIDS-relatedmortality,includingthatfromother
cancers and cardiovascular disease. This value highlighted the
reported HIV-conferred risk of myocardial infarction and
matched the HIV-associated lung cancer risk ratio we applied
in the base case.37-39,43
Population-Level Impact
We derived the number of current, former, and never smok-
ers among PLWH aged 20 to 64 years in HIV care in the
United States by sex and 5-year age increment (the overall
prevalence of current, former, and never smokers among
PLWH was approximately 42%, 20%, and 37%, respectively,
in 2009).3,31 Accounting for reported rates of ART nonad-
herence and loss to follow-up from care, we used model-
generated cumulative lung cancer mortality for each sex,
age, and smoking stratum to derive the expected total
number of lung cancer deaths by age 80 years among PLWH
in HIV care in the United States. To examine the potential
impact of a smoking cessation intervention, we estimated
the reduction in lung cancer deaths if 20% of current
smokers in each sex and age cohort were to quit smoking
(Supplement).

 Results
Model Validation
For HIV-uninfected people, model-generated cumulative lung
cancer mortalities by age 75 years for current heavy smokers
were 24.5% and 19.5% for men and women, respectively; these
values are similar to those reported in the United Kingdom,
24.4% and 18.5% (eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement).28 For
20-year-old PLWH in the United States, our model-generated
cumulative lung cancer mortality by age 75 years was 5.0%,
while the modeled cumulative lung cancer incidence re-
ported by NA-ACCORD was 3.7% (Supplement).30

 moderate, and light current smokers was 27.8%, 20.9%, and
16.6%; for heavy, moderate, and light former smokers who quit
at age 40 years, it was 7.5%, 5.2%, and 3.7%; for never smok-
ers, it was 1.2% (Table 2 and Figure 1). Cumulative lung can-
cer mortality for ART-adherent current and never smokers var-
ied little by age at entry to HIV care, with slightly higher results
among those entering care at older ages owing to survival bias
(Table 2).
Risk of Mortality From Lung Cancer vs Other Causes
Risks of mortality from lung cancer vs other causes varied by
smoking exposure. For men who entered HIV care at age 40
years, adhered to the ART regimen, and continued to smoke
at a moderate (“average”) level, cumulative mortality from
lung cancer was 10 times that from AIDS-related causes
(23.0% vs 2.3%; Figure 2A). The mortality for former smok-
ers in this category is illustrated in Figure 2B, and for never
smokers, it is illustrated in eFigure 2A in the Supplement.
For women who entered HIV care at age 40 years, adhered to
the ART regimen, and continued to smoke at a moderate
(“average”) level, cumulative mortality from lung cancer
was 8 times that from AIDS-related causes (20.9% vs 2.5%).
Depending on sex and smoking intensity, ART-adherent
smokers were 6 to 13 times more likely to die from lung can-
cer than from AIDS-related causes. For 40-year-old ART-
adherent men who were current moderate smokers, the
combined cumulative mortality from lung cancer and other
non–AIDS-related causes—both of which were increased by
smoking—was approximately 35 times that from AIDS-
related causes (79.9% vs 2.3%); for women in this category,
it was approximately 27 times higher (66.6% vs 2.5%)
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). See eTable 4 in the Supplement
for results for different ages at entry to HIV care.
Sensitivity Analysis
For the sensitivity analyses described in the Methods sec-
tion, we report instances where input data were most uncer-
tain and/or where variation in the underlying parameter had
a material impact on our findings. Results of other sensitivity
analyses (including varying CD4 count at entry to HIV care and
timing of smoking cessation) are reported in the Supplement.
Incomplete Adherence and Loss to Follow-up
When we accounted for reported rates of ART nonadherence
and loss to follow-up from HIV care, cumulative lung cancer
mortality among moderate smokers decreased, and cumula-
tive AIDS-related mortality increased (Figure 2C and D). The
results for never smokers are depicted in eFigure 2B in the
Supplement. For men who were current heavy smokers, cu-

 mulative lung cancer mortality (22.7%) was similar to AIDS-
related mortality (23.0%); for women, the corresponding re-
sults were 21.6% vs 25.5% (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Varying HIV-Associated Risks of Lung Cancer
and of Other Non–AIDS-Related Mortality
Model-generated cumulative mortality varied depending on
the HIV-associated risk ratios applied for lung cancer and for
other non–AIDS-related causes. For male and female current
moderate smokers, cumulative lung cancer mortality varied
from 10.5% to 23.0%, and cumulative other non–AIDS-
related mortality varied from 45.7% to 78.0%. The lower num-
bers reflected scenarios assuming no direct influence of HIV
on these causes of death (Table 3).
Population-Level Impact
Applying sex- and age-specific, model-projected results to the
approximately 644 200 PLWH aged 20 to 64 years in care in
the United States (including current, former, and never smok-
ers), 59 900 lung cancer deaths by age 80 years are expected
(9.3% of this population) if smoking status does not change.
If 20% of the 273 200 current smokers quit, their lung cancer
riskwoulddecreasetothatofformersmokers,and6900(11.5%)
lung cancer deaths could be averted.
Discussion
Using a microsimulation model, we found that ART-
adherent PLWH in the United States who smoke cigarettes
are 6 to 13 times more likely to die from lung cancer than
from AIDS-related causes. Even when accounting for
reported rates of ART nonadherence and loss to follow-up,
we found that nearly 10% of PLWH initially linked to HIV
care (including both smokers and nonsmokers) are expected
to die from lung cancer if smoking habits do not change.
Smoking cessation could substantially reduce lung cancer
risk for an individual and avert many lung cancer deaths at
the population level.
People with HIV whose virus is suppressed now have a life
expectancyapproachingthatofHIV-uninfectedpeople.44How-
ever, life expectancy gaps persist, and smoking is a key driver
of this difference.45 This smoking footprint will likely grow as
PLWH age and develop lung cancer and other smoking-
associateddiseases.Lungcancerwasalreadytheleadingcause
of death in a study of PLWH in France in 2010; the smoking

ART indicates antiretroviral therapy; LTFU, loss to follow-up. The intensity of
smoking (number of cigarettes per day) was considered to be moderate
(“
average”). Current smokers continued smoking until the end of follow-up.
Former smokers quit at age 40 years and remained abstinent. “Number at risk”
tables are not needed here. The graphs represent model-generated outcomes,
each line a simulated cohort of 1 million people entering HIV care at age 40
years. While some people are lost to follow-up from clinical care (in the
sensitivity analyses that allow for loss to follow-up), the model still keeps track
of them, recording when and how they die, so they are not lost from the model
or from the results. The number at risk are the number of people still alive at
each time point, with no other form of censoring.

a The model-generated results are for people who entered HIV care at age 40
years and were followed up until death or age 80 years. These simulations
assumed moderate (“
average”) intensity of smoking, based on number of
cigarettes per day. Individuals continued smoking until the end of follow-up.
The HIV-associated mortality risk ratios represent the independent risk
conferred by HIV, compared with HIV-uninfected people, of mortality from
either lung cancer or other non–AIDS-related causes. A mortality risk ratio of
1.0 indicates no increased risk for a person with HIV compared with an
HIV-uninfected person of otherwise similar characteristics.
bNon–AIDS-related causes of death include cardiovascular disease and cancers
besides lung cancer.
c AIDS-related causes of death include opportunistic infections and chronic
AIDS-related conditions such as wasting.

 prevalence among PLWH is similar in France and the United
States.3,20,46
In stratifying mortality risks by smoking status and inten-
sity, our results can inform important conversations between
clinicians and PLWH who smoke, helping both clinician and
patient understand the patient’
s risks of different diseases and
the potential benefits of smoking cessation. Recognizing the
increased risk of death from lung cancer vs that from tradi-
tionally feared AIDS-related causes may motivate a smoker to
quit smoking,47 although this is not always the case. Our analy-
ses also accounted for the smoking-conferred increase in risk
of death from causes besides lung cancer and AIDS—this in-
cludes other cancers, other lung diseases, and cardiovascular
disease. Our results provide evidence for HIV care programs
and policymakers to include smoking cessation interven-
tions as a key component of the comprehensive care of PLWH.
Though smoking cessation is challenging, smoking preva-
lence among the US general population has decreased sub-
stantially in recent decades, from 42% in 1965 to 15% in
2015.7,48 While the current smoking prevalence among PLWH
ismuchhigherthanthatamongHIV-uninfectedpeople,asimi-
lar proportion of smokers in the 2 groups want to quit, offer-
ing hope for a potential decrease in smoking prevalence in
PLWH as well.49
Perhaps counterintuitively, lung cancer risk is linked to
adherence to HIV therapy. Those who are not ART-adherent
are more likely to die of AIDS-related causes before develop-
ing lung cancer. Nonetheless, even when accounting for
reported rates of ART nonadherence and loss to follow-up
from HIV care, we found that for male heavy smokers, the
risk of dying from lung cancer is similar to the risk of dying
from AIDS-related causes.
Limitations
Our results are subject to limitations inherent in the assump-
tions and simplifications of any model-based study. These
include the following: (1) using data from the US general
population in 2000 in the absence of smoking-stratified lung
cancer data for PLWH; (2) uncertainty around the HIV-
conferred risk of lung cancer, which could be lower or higher
than what we applied in this analysis, and could vary by
age11,13-17,50; (3) assuming no relationship between CD4 count
and lung cancer risk, given conflicting reports affected by
confounders such as smoking intensity15,19,51-54; (4) assum-
ing that the HIV-associated increase in lung cancer mortality
is similar to the increase in incidence, since median survival
after lung cancer diagnosis is short11,40; (5) not accounting
for disparities between PLWH and HIV-uninfected people in
mortality after lung cancer diagnosis17,55-58; (6) not examin-
ing race: African American men are overrepresented among
PLWH in the United States and may be more susceptible to
lung cancer than people of other races31,59; (7) not differenti-
ating by HIV transmission risk category: the national survey
data for smoking prevalence among PLWH indicated little
difference by sexual transmission risk category, but there
were few injection drug users3; (8) not accounting for possi-
bly higher average daily cigarette consumption among
PLWH who smoke compared with HIV-uninfected people
who smoke11; (9) assuming, in the base case, that smoking
status does not change over time; and (10) not examining a
potential impact on mortality from lung cancer screening
with computed tomography.60,61 Estimating smoking-
attributable mortality for various diseases would be informa-
tive, but the data for non-AIDS, non–lung cancer outcomes
were too limited to do so. The smoking-conferred risk of
death from smoking-related diseases may be even greater
than that applied in our analyses, especially in PLWH.43
Though the model-generated estimates may be influenced
by input parameter uncertainty, the magnitude of smoking-
related harm with respect to lung cancer and other non–
AIDS-related mortality, and the magnitude of the benefit
from smoking cessation, remain robust, as shown in our sen-
sitivity analysis.
Conclusions
In conclusion, there is a large expected burden of lung can-
cer among PLWH in the United States because (1) the smok-
ing prevalence is very high in this population; (2) HIV itself
increases the risk of lung cancer; and (3) PLWH are increas-
ingly living long enough to develop lung cancer. For PLWH
who adhere to ART, smoking is a much greater threat to their
health than HIV itself. Clinicians caring for PLWH should
offer guideline-based behavioral and pharmacologic treat-
ments for tobacco use.62 Lung cancer is now a leading cause
of death among PLWH, but smoking cessation can greatly
reduce the risk. Lung cancer prevention, especially through
smoking cessation, should be a priority in the comprehen-
sive care of PLWH.
