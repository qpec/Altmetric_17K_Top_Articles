diabetes (T2D) is characterized by reductions in �-cell function and
insulin secretion on the background of elevated insulin resistance.
Aerobic exercise has been shown to improve �-cell function, despite
a subset of T2D patients displaying “exercise resistance.” Further
investigations into the effectiveness of alternate forms of exercise on
�-cell function in the T2D patient population are needed. We exam-
ined the effect of a novel, 6-wk CrossFit functional high-intensity
training (F-HIT) intervention on �-cell function in 12 sedentary adults
with clinically diagnosed T2D (54 � 2 yr, 166 � 16 mg/dl fasting
glucose). Supervised training was completed 3 days/wk, comprising
functional movements performed at a high intensity in a variety of 10-
to 20-min sessions. All subjects completed an oral glucose tolerance
test and anthropometric measures at baseline and following the
intervention. The mean disposition index, a validated measure of
�-cell function, was significantly increased (PRE: 8.4 � 3.1, POST:
11.5 � 3.5, P � 0.02) after the intervention. Insulin processing
inefficiency in the �-cell, expressed as the fasting proinsulin-to-
insulin ratio, was also reduced (PRE: 2.40 � 0.37, POST: 1.78 �
0.30, P � 0.04). Increased �-cell function during the early-phase
response to glucose correlated significantly with reductions in abdom-
inal body fat (R2 � 0.56, P � 0.005) and fasting plasma alkaline
phosphatase (R2 � 0.55, P � 0.006). Mean total body-fat percentage
decreased significantly (�: �1.17 0.30%, P � 0.003), whereas lean
body mass was preserved (�: �0.05 � 0.68 kg, P � 0.94). We
conclude that F-HIT is an effective exercise strategy for improving
�-cell function in adults with T2D.

INSULIN IS AN essential glucoregulatory hormone. In the pres-
ence of insulin resistance, this pancreatic �-cell-secreted hor-
mone has a diminished ability to drive plasma glucose into
peripheral tissues. The subsequent glycemic dysregulation is
overcome by �-cell compensation via insulin hypersecretion.
In a subset of individuals, however, the �-cell is unable to
sustain this compensatory state and eventually undergoes fail-
ure. This progression underlies the pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes (T2D) and is the topic of several in-depth reviews (8,
12, 15). The investigation of therapies that target recovery of
�-cell function in the T2D patient population is of paramount
clinical importance, as 21 million American adults have al-
ready been diagnosed with the disease (7).
Several groups have demonstrated that exercise has a pro-
found effect on insulin secretion and �-cell function (16, 29),
in addition to its already-established influence on insulin sen-
sitivity (17, 28). The specific effects of exercise on �-cell
function appear to be dependent on metabolic status and the
mode of exercise implemented. We have shown that a 12-wk
aerobic exercise intervention improved �-cell function in
adults with T2D (31). The same intervention also suppressed
insulin hypersecretion in healthy, overweight adults. We fur-
ther demonstrated that exercise-driven improvements in glyce-
mic control were better predicted by insulin secretion rather
than sensitivity (32). Specifically, participants with greater
preintervention pancreatic secretory function also had the
greatest improvements in glycemic control. When comparing
responses with physical training in T2D patients with moderate
vs. low secretory capacity, Dela et al. (9) reached a similar
conclusion, showing that only the moderate secretors re-
sponded favorably to exercise training. From these findings,
there appears to be a response dichotomy to exercise in the
T2D population, specifically dependent on residual �-cell se-
cretory capacity.
The aforementioned studies used only aerobic exercise train-
ing. A recently published study of 8 wk of high-intensity
interval training, which has risen in popularity in both the
exercise science field and society at large, in adults with T2D
showed improvements in �-cell function, despite no changes in
insulin secretion or sensitivity (21). The combination of aero-
bic and resistance training in the Studies Targeting Risk Re-
duction Interventions through Defined Exercise-Aerobic Train-
ing and/or Resistance Training randomized trial resulted in
increased �-cell function to a greater extent than either training
mode alone in sedentary, obese, nondiabetic adults (1). Com-
bination training or high-intensity training may be able to
overcome the apparent resistance to exercise seen in some
individuals in aerobic training-only studies, but this has yet to
be investigated.

 The exercise approach that was developed by CrossFit
differs significantly from the exercise protocols used in studies
to date and may be described as a functional high-intensity
training (F-HIT) protocol. This type of supervised training is
defined by constantly varied, functional movements performed
at a high intensity and combines resistance training, gymnas-
tics (body weight), and aerobic exercise. Importantly, workouts
only require 10–20 min/session and are only performed 3
times/wk (30). To date, there are no published studies that have
assessed �-cell function in F-HIT or resistance training within
the T2D patient population. We hypothesized that this novel
F-HIT intervention program would increase �-cell function in
adults with T2D.
METHODS
Subjects. This pilot, proof-of-principle study, involved 12 adults
with clinically diagnosed T2D (8 women, 4 men; glycated hemoglo-
bin test, 8.6 � 0.7%; 53 � 2 yr), recruited from the Cleveland met-
ropolitan area. All participants were receiving standard-of-care treat-
ment, including Metformin and diet/exercise education, but none was
taking insulin to control his or her diabetes. Exclusion criteria in-
cluded heart, kidney, liver, thyroid, intestinal, and pulmonary diseases
or medications known to affect the outcome variables of the study. All
participants underwent medical history, physical exam, and clinical
blood work before entering the study. Participants were sedentary
(�1 h of exercise/wk) and weight stable (�5 lb.) for the prior
6 mo. Study design and procedures were approved by the Cleve-
land Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants pro-
vided written, informed consent.
Intervention. Exercise was composed of 6 wk of F-HIT (CrossFit)
training, performed at an established gym (Great Lakes CrossFit,
Bedford Heights, OH) under the instruction of a certified CrossFit
trainer. Groups of two to four participants performed three exercise
training sessions per week, which included one high-intensity workout
(�85% heart rate maximum), ranging in duration from 10 to 20 min.
Over the course of 6 wk, participants were exposed to an array of
functional weightlifting, gymnastics, and endurance movements in
various combinations. More information about the individual move-
ments and exercises may be found on the CrossFit website (https://
www.crossfit.com/exercisedemos/). Post-testing commenced within
36 h after the final exercise bout.
Oral glucose tolerance test. Participants were provided a standard-
ized mixed-meal dinner (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein) the
night before testing. The meal made up 33% of their daily energy
requirements, based on the Harris–Benedict equation (13). Medica-
tions were withheld 24 h before testing, and the participants also
refrained from structured exercise during that time. Following an
overnight (~12 h) fast, a baseline blood sample (5 ml) was drawn from
an antecubital vein. A 75-g glucose beverage was then consumed
within 5 min. Additional blood samples were drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120,
and 180 min after the glucose was consumed. Aprotinin, EDTA, and
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors were included in subaliquots of
plasma and serum, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Blood analysis. The following clinical blood measures were deter-
mined on an automated platform (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN): alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine transaminase (ALT), plasma glucose, total triglycerides, total
cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL choles-
terol. Free fatty acids (FFAs) were measured on serum samples
collected at 0 and 120 min of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
using a nonesterified fatty acid enzymatic colorimetric quantification
assay (Wako Diagnostics, Richmond, VA). FFA suppression was
calculated as the percent reduction in serum FFA from the 0- to
120-min time points (14). Insulin and C-peptide were measured for all
OGTT samples via radioimmunoassay (Millipore Sigma, Billerica,
MA) and counted on a Beckman Gamma 4000 Counter (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA). Intact proinsulin was measured by ELISA (Mer-
codia, Uppsala, Sweden), with �0.03 and �0.006% specificity for
insulin and C-peptide, respectively. Plasma glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) were
measured on baseline and 30 and 60 min samples using an ELISA
(Millipore Sigma). Insulin processing was calculated as the ratio of
proinsulin to insulin (6). The early-phase C-peptide secretory response
(secretory index), an established predictor of early-phase insulin
secretion, was calculated as the ratio of the change in plasma C-pep-
tide and glucose concentrations between baseline (0 min) and 30 min
samples during the OGTT (26). Late-phase insulin secretion was
calculated as the ratio of the total area under the curve (tAUC) for
plasma C-peptide and glucose measures, from 30 to 180 min of the
OGTT. An insulin sensitivity index was calculated using the validated
Stumvoll equation (37). �-Cell function [disposition index (DI)] was
individually calculated as the product of the secretory index and
insulin sensitivity index � 103 (2). Unless stated otherwise, secretion
and �-cell function here refer to the early-phase secretion index and
DI, respectively.
Body composition. Body composition measures were obtained
before and after completion of the intervention. Body weight was
determined using standard procedures to the nearest 0.1 kg, averaged
over three independent measures. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
was used to determine total and depot-specific body fat, as well as lean
mass, with the Lunar iDXA model scanner and software (GE Health-
care, Madison, WI).
Physical performance. All participants underwent a screening 12-
lead ECG submaximal exercise stress test (SensorMedics; Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) to assess healthy heart function and
safety to exercise. The test was performed on a treadmill at constant
speed, while the grade was increased in 2 min stages until the
individual reached 80–85% of his or her age-predicted heart rate max.
Blood pressure was also recorded during every 2 min stage of the test.
A second incremental-graded treadmill exercise test was administered
on a separate day and was performed before and after the exercise
intervention to measure maximal oxygen consumption (V
˙ O2max; Jae-
ger Oxycon Pro; Viasys Healthcare, Yorba Linda, CA) (17). The test
was deemed maximal if there was a plateau of V
˙ O2 despite an
increased workload and at least two of the following additional
criteria were satisfied: volitional fatigue, heart rate greater than age-
predicted maximum, and respiratory exchange ratio of �1.10. Blood
pressure and heart rate were also monitored during the test. Perfor-
mance during each exercise training session was recorded by the
CrossFit trainer. Days 2 and 18 (final session) consisted of the same
sets of exercises with total repetitions recorded: five sets of 1 min of
rowing, 1 min of sit-ups, 1 min of squats (no weight), and 1 min of
rest. One subject did not complete a postintervention V
˙ O2max test due
to equipment failure, and another subject did not have the number of
repetitions recorded for his or her final exercise training session.
Statistics. Data are presented as means � SE. Statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La
Jolla, CA). Data sets were tested for normality using the Shapiro–
Wilk test. Non-normal data were natural log transformed to approach
normality, which was subsequently confirmed using the Shapiro–Wilk
test. PRE to POST intervention statistical comparisons were analyzed
with a paired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Linear regression analyses
between study variables (� vs. �) were also performed in GraphPad
Prism 5, using the Pearson test for correlations. Non-normally dis-
tributed � data sets were also natural log transformed to approach
normality. The accepted significance for each two-tailed test and
Pearson correlation was set a priori at P � 0.05.

 measures are listed in Table 1. Body composition changed
significantly, with a mean reduction in total body fat percent-
age (�: �1.1 � 0.3%, P � 0.002), along with trending total
body weight loss (�: �1.8 � 1.0 kg, P � 0.09). Exercise
capacity was significantly greater after training, with increases
in both V
˙ O2max (�: 0.38 � 0.08 l/min, P � 0.001) and total
repetitions completed for standardized training sessions (�:
59 � 8, P � 0.001). Mean fasting plasma measures of glucose,
insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and FFAs, which are of general
clinical importance to patients with T2D, did not change
significantly. Measures of liver enzyme levels in the plasma
(ALP, AST, ALT) were significantly, or tended to be, reduced.
First-phase (0–30 min) and late-phase (30–180 min) plasma
glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin remained un-
changed as well (Table 1).
Insulin secretion. The early-phase DI was significantly im-
proved following the intervention (PRE: 8.4 � 3.1, POST:
11.5 � 3.5, P � 0.02; Fig. 1A). Late-phase DI was not in-
creased (PRE: 15.6 � 3.1, POST: 16.4 � 2.5, P � 0.65). There
was, however, variability in individual responses to the inter-
vention with regard to DI (Fig. 1C). Individuals with �DI
above and below the mean are indicated. Since DI is the
product of early-phase secretion and insulin sensitivity, the
individual changes (�) for these measures are presented in Fig.
1, D and E. The individual demarcations from Fig. 1C are
retained in Fig. 1, D and E to illustrate further the variability in
responses to the intervention. These latter data show that
improvements in insulin secretion, and not insulin sensitivity,
were most likely responsible for the improvement in DI. The
proinsulin/insulin ratio, a measure of insulin-processing inef-
ficiency, was reduced after the intervention (PRE: 2.40 � 0.37,
POST: 1.78 � 0.30, P � 0.04; Fig. 1B).
Incretin and FFA responses. Fasting GLP-1 (PRE: 3.32 �
0.65, POST: 3.46 � 0.72 ng/ml, P � 0.78) and GIP (PRE:
40.5 � 7.0, POST: 46.9 � 7.0 ng/ml, P � 0.14) levels re-
mained unchanged, as well as tAUC for the first 60 min of the
OGTT: GLP-1 (PRE: 558 � 98, POST: 477 � 88 ng· ml�1·
min�1, P � 0.58), GIP (PRE: 10,903 � 1,502, POST: 11,645 �
1,257 ng·ml�1·min�1, P � 0.38). The intervention did not sig-
nificantly alter fasting FFA levels (Table 1) or FFA suppression
(PRE: �78.4 � 3.8, POST: �78.5 � 5.3%, P � 0.98).
Correlations. Based on correlation analyses, changes in
body composition and ALP correlated significantly with �-cell
function and secretion. These data are presented in Fig. 2, with
linear regressions and 95% confidence intervals plotted for
each � vs. � correlation. The individual demarcations from
Fig. 1 for individual responses in early-phase �-cell function
are kept in Fig. 2. This representation further emphasizes the
significant correlations between changes in �-cell function
and insulin secretion and decreases in abdominal body fat
and lowered fasting serum ALP levels. Individual changes
in the fasting proinsulin/insulin ratio, another measure of
�-cell function, did not correlate significantly with any
study variables.
Subgroup analysis. Figure 2C shows the spread of individual
responses to the F-HIT intervention based on the DI-derived
�-cell function index. Subgroup analyses were performed to
compare the individuals demarcated in Fig. 1 as above the
mean (“responders,” n � 5) vs. below the mean (“nonre-
sponders,” n � 7). Participants in the responder subgroup were
all women, with no significant differences from the nonre-
sponders in terms of age or body composition. This responder
subgroup had higher PRE intervention fasting plasma ALP
levels (92 � 5 vs. 64 � 7 U/l, P � 0.008), as well as higher

mg·dl�1·min�1, P � 0.02) intervention. Secretory capacity,
expressed as C-peptide tAUC (0–180 min), was also greater in
the responder subgroup, PRE (792.4 � 54.0 vs. 550.8 � 73.9
ng·ml�1·min�1, P � 0.03) and POST (787.0 � 44.5 vs. 569.0 �

tion changes were significantly greater in the responder subgroup
(0.20 � 0.06 vs. �0.02 � 0.01 ng·ml�1·mM�1, P � 0.02), which
is apparent from the distribution of individual changes in secretion
presented in Fig. 1D. Congruent with the correlations shown in
Fig. 2, fasting plasma ALP levels (�18.4 � 3.3 vs. 0.9 � 2.6 U/l,
P � 0.002) and abdominal fat (�2.6 � 0.85 vs. 0.40 � 0.65%,
P � 0.02) were significantly reduced in the responder
subgroup. Following the intervention, the responder sub-
group also had lower fasting plasma glucose (126 � 11 vs.
187 � 22 mg/dl, P � 0.04).
DISCUSSION
The determination of �-cell function in humans poses spe-
cific challenges, as only indirect plasma metabolite measures
are generally possible. The OGTT has emerged as an efficient
and effective method for assessing pancreatic insulin secretion
(36). However, insulin secretion is tied directly to insulin
sensitivity in a classic hyperbolic relationship (4). The DI,
which is the mathematical product of secretion and sensitivity,
has thus been clinically accepted and validated as a measure of
�-cell function in humans (33). Here, we show that exercise at
high intensity for as little as 10–20 min/day, 3 days/wk for 6
wk, improves �-cell function in adults with T2D (Fig. 1A). The
fasting proinsulin/insulin ratio, representing the processing
inefficiency of insulin within the �-cell, was also significantly
reduced following the intervention (Fig. 1B), providing further
evidence for improved �-cell function.
Despite the achievement of mean improvements in �-cell
function, overall glucose tolerance was not significantly
changed. Following a more traditional, 3-mo aerobic exercise
intervention in T2D patients, Dela et al. (9) used a subgroup
analysis to show that only participants with residual �-cell
secretory capacity (defined as “moderate secretors”) had sig-
nificantly improved �-cell function, despite no changes in
glucose tolerance. We also found variability in individual
changes in DI, where some participants had limited changes
and even reductions in DI in response to the intervention.
Therefore, we used a similar subgroup analysis approach to
delineate possible factors that might contribute to these differ-
ences. This analysis revealed that the responder subgroup did
indeed show improved glucose tolerance, lower glucose tAUC,
and fasting glucose POST intervention, following the interven-
tion, in contrast to the nonresponder subgroup. These data
highlight that participants who did not appreciably improve

 their �-cell function also did not experience improvements in

Resistance to the beneficial effects of exercise could be due
to underperformance or compensatory lifestyle changes, as
some research groups have suggested (20, 24, 35). This vari-
ability in response to lifestyle intervention has been noted
before (5). In this study, two measures of physical performance
improved very significantly in response to the intervention
(Table 1), but neither �-cell function nor secretion significantly
correlated with either of these measures. Within the subgroup
analysis, there were also no differences between “training
volume” or the total number of repetitions in comparative
sessions between either of the two subgroups. As a result, we
cannot attribute response variability specifically to differences
in training effort. Instead, as our previously published (32) and
currently presented data suggest, residual �-cell secretory ca-
pacity is required for exercise (independent of mode) to im-
prove �-cell function and glycemic control effectively. Longer
exercise interventions, combined with strict dietary guidelines,
may be able to drive improvements in �-cell function in
patients with more severe T2D who display resistance to the
exercise modes studied to date (25). However, if nonresponse
is driven by genetic factors, as Stephens and Sparks (34) and
Lessard et al. (20) suggest, then the modification of lifestyle
only may not be a sufficient therapeutic approach.
The intervention was quite effective at reducing total body
fat, with trending reductions in body weight. Notably, lean
mass was preserved (�: 0.05 � 0.68 kg, P � 0.94), indicating
that any changes in body weight were due to reductions in fat
mass. We also found that reductions in abdominal fat corre-
lated significantly with changes in both �-cell function (R2 �
0.56, P � 0.005) and secretion (R2 � 0.41, P � 0.02; Fig. 2).
Accumulation of adipose tissue in the abdominal region has
been linked to increased insulin resistance (18) and correlates
closely with increased �-cell dysfunction (40), highlighting the
negative role of fat in this region on metabolic function.
Potential mechanisms include increased plasma FFAs driving
lipotoxicitiy of the �-cell (3). However, we did not see any
significant statistical association between change in FFAs and
�-cell function. We recognize that fasting levels of FFAs do
not adequately represent the dynamic regulation of lipolysis
(38). However, the percent suppression of plasma FFAs from
min 0 to 120 of the OGTT also remained unchanged after the
intervention. We have previously reported that exercise and
diet intervention-induced improvements in �-cell function
among adults with T2D were significantly correlated with
changes in GIP (31). However, the incretin hormone levels of
GLP-1 and GIP remained unchanged in this study, suggesting
that some other mechanism is driving improved �-cell function
after this type of intervention.
Many patients with T2D also have accompanying nonalco-
holic fatty liver disease and hepatocyte apoptosis, which we
(10) and others (27) have shown can be reduced by exercise
(aerobic and resistance training). Mean plasma AST and ALT
levels, which are clinical measures of liver hepatocyte apopto-
sis, were significantly reduced following the intervention (Ta-
ble 1), suggesting overall improvements in liver function (11).
Fasting ALP also tended to decrease. The correlations in Fig.
2 and our subgroup analyses reveal that in the responder
subgroup, ALP levels were significantly elevated PRE inter-
vention but markedly reduced POST intervention. Cross-sec-
tional analysis of plasma ALP levels show that there appears to
be no link to sex (41), despite the sex differences between the
two subgroups. The source of circulating ALP, which may be
of liver, bone, or intestinal origin, was not specifically identi-
fied in the clinical assay performed. As a result, we are unable

FUNCTIONAL-HIT IMPROVES �-CELL FUNCTION IN T2D

 to conclude whether ALP levels were indicative of changes in
liver, gut, or bone function. The limited available literature on
the topic of ALP in T2D is conflicting. One study determined
that bone is the predominant source of elevated ALP in T2D
(23), although this is not a consistent observation (39). In a
mouse model, a high fat diet increases serum ALP levels, but
ALP was unaffected by exercise training, despite protecting the
mice from liver steatosis and loss of �-cell function (22). Our
data are contrary to these animal model findings, highlighting
the need to investigate further the role of this enzyme in
diabetes and exercise, especially as it relates to �-cell function.
This was a pilot proof-of-principle study investigating the
efficacy of a 6-wk F-HIT lifestyle intervention in adults with
T2D, and hence, limitations of this study include the relatively
small sample size and lack of comparative groups, in the form
of a control group or groups participating in alternative forms
of exercise. Instead, we designed the study using an internal
validity paradigm, where each participant’s PRE intervention
served as the control for the POST intervention testing results.
Second, we note that from a technical perspective, the use of
the hyperglycemic clamp technique would have provided a
more in-depth determination of pancreatic function.
There is little scientific doubt that exercise is beneficial, yet
adults with T2D may find it difficult to adhere to a strict
exercise regimen, citing “lack of time” as one of their primary
barriers (19). F-HIT programs, such as CrossFit, may address
this barrier by providing structure, supervision, and account-
ability, with a minimal time commitment (10–20 min/session,
3 times/wk). Additionally, no adverse events or injuries were
reported by participants throughout the course of the study.
Therefore, we conclude that F-HIT is a safe and effective
exercise approach by which adults with T2D may improve
their �-cell secretory function, given that residual �-cell secre-
tory capacity is preserved. Here, we have identified that
changes in plasma ALP levels and abdominal adiposity appear
to be additional delineating factors in determining the efficacy
of exercise-mediated improvements in �-cell function. Larger
training studies may shed important insight into the variability
in responses to exercise observed in the T2D patient population
and subsequently, to develop the most effective exercise treat-
ment options for these patients.
