IMPORTANCE The association between socioeconomic status and survival based on all-cause,
cardiovascular (CV), diabetes-related, and cancer mortality in type 2 diabetes has not been
examined in a setting of persons with equitable access to health care with adjustment for
important confounders.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether income, educational level, marital status, and country of
birth are independently associated with all-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer mortality
in persons with type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A study including all 217 364 individuals younger than
70 years with type 2 diabetes in the Sweden National Diabetes Register (January 1, 2003, to
December 31, 2010) who were monitored through December 31, 2012, was conducted. A Cox
proportional hazards regression model with up to 17 covariates was used for analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer mortality.
RESULTS Of the 217 364 persons included in the study, mean (SD) age was 58.3 (9.3) years
and 130 839 of the population (60.2%) was male. There were a total of 19 105 all-cause
deaths with 11 423 (59.8%), 6984 (36.6%), and 6438 (33.7%) CV, diabetes-related, or cancer
deaths, respectively. Compared with being single, hazard ratios (HRs) for married individuals,
determined using fully adjusted models, for all-cause, CV, and diabetes-related mortality were
0.73 (95% CI, 0.70-0.77), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.63-0.71), and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.57-0.67),
respectively. Marital status was not associated with overall cancer mortality, but married men
had a 33% lower risk of prostate cancer mortality compared with single men, with an HR of
0.67 (95% CI, 0.50-0.90). Comparison of HRs for the lowest vs highest income quintiles for
all-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer mortality were 1.71 (95% CI, 1.60-1.83), 1.87 (95%
CI, 1.72-2.05), 1.80 (95% CI, 1.61-2.01), and 1.28 (95% CI, 1.14-1.44), respectively. Compared
with native Swedes, HRs for all-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer mortality for
non-Western immigrants were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.48-0.63), 0.46 (95% CI, 0.38-0.56), 0.38
(95% CI, 0.29-0.49), and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58-0.88), respectively, and these HRs were
virtually unaffected by covariate adjustment. Hazard ratios for those with a college/university
degree compared with 9 years or less of education were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.90), 0.84
(95% CI, 0.78-0.91), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93) for all-cause, CV, and cancer mortality,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Independent of risk factors, access to health care, and use of
health care, socioeconomic status is a powerful predictor of all-cause and CV mortality but
was not as strong as a predictor of death from cancer.

S
ocioeconomic status is a fundamental element of pub-
lic and individual health,1 indicating an individual’
s re-
sources and ability to thrive and survive. Socioeco-
nomic measures commonly include race/ethnicity, income,
educational level, and occupation. Other featured compo-
nents are sex and marital status.
Socioeconomicstatusisgenerallyinverselyassociatedwith
the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and death2-5 as well as
the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (referred to as diabetes
for the study outcomes).6-8 Studies have demonstrated that
mortality rates among individuals with diabetes vary accord-
ing to neighborhood9,10 as well as individual income and edu-
cational level.11-13
However, access to medical care, varying risk factors,
and comorbidities may contribute to socioeconomic differ-
ences in outcome. Sweden provides a setting in which
socioeconomic status has a minimal influence on access
to and use of health care services and comprehensive
individual-level data on risk factors, as well as clinical and
socioeconomic variables, in individuals with diabetes.
Given these prerequisites, the present nationwide study
aimed at examining how socioeconomic status relates to the
adjusted risk of all-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer
mortality in diabetes.
Methods
The National Diabetes Register (NDR) in Sweden was launched
in 1996 as a tool for quality control of care for persons with dia-
betes.Nursesandphysiciansinprimaryhealthcarecentersand
hospital outpatient clinics report information on these pa-
tients. Reporting, which is carried out online or by direct data
transmission from electronic medical records to the NDR, is
done at least once a year and includes information on clinical
characteristics. The NDR currently includes the vast majority
of all Swedish individuals with diabetes.14,15
The present study was approved by the ethics committee
of the University of Gothenburg. All individuals provided ver-
bal informed consent before being included in the NDR, and
data were deidentified.
Study Cohort
We included 217 364 individuals younger than 70 years with
diabetes who had at least 1 entry in the NDR between January
1, 2003, and December 31, 2010. We excluded individuals 70
years or older because income drops steeply after retirement,
whereaseducationallevelisunchanged.Withoutthisagelimit,
a large proportion of the events would occur among the el-
derly, which would influence estimated hazard ratios (HRs).
We intended to study a homogeneous cohort in terms of the
association between socioeconomic status and mortality and
therefore restricted the cohort to individuals of working age;
the youngest age in our cohort was 18 years.
Type 2 diabetes was defined on the basis of epidemio-
logicdata:participantswerereceivingtreatmentwithdietwith
or without the use of oral hypoglycemic agents or treatment
with insulin with or without the use of oral hypoglycemic
agents.Thelattercategoryappliedonlytoparticipants40years
or older at diagnosis of diabetes.
Socioeconomic Data
DataonindividualincomeinSwedishkronor(1USdollarequals
8 Swedish kronor), highest educational level, country of birth,
marital status, and occupation were obtained from the Lon-
gitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and
Labour Market Studies (http://www.scb.se/en_/Services
/Guidance-for-researchers-and-universities/SCB-Data
/Longitudinal-integration-database-for-health-insurance
-and-labour-market-studies-LISA-by-Swedish-acronym/#).
Education was stratified into lower (≤9 years, with 9 years
being the length of compulsory education in Sweden),
intermediate (10-12 years, upper secondary), and higher
(college/university). Income was stratified into quintiles.
Country of birth was categorized into the following groups:
Sweden, high-income Europe, low-income Europe, non-
Western, and Nordic. Marital categories were single (never
marriedorhadaregisteredpartner),marriedorhadaregistered
partner, divorced, or widowed.
Clinical Data
Microalbuminuria was defined as 2 positive tests from 3
samples taken within 1 year, with an albumin to creatinine ra-
tio of 3 to 30 mg/mmol or urinary albumin level of 20 to 200
μg/min or 20 to 300 mg/L. Macroalbuminuria was defined as
an albumin to creatinine ratio greater than 30 mg/mmol or uri-
naryalbuminlevelgreaterthan200μg/minorgreaterthan300
mg/L. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was estimated with
the Modified Diet in Renal Disease equation.16,17 Systolic blood
pressure was the mean value of 2 supine readings after at least
5 minutes of rest with a cuff of appropriate size. Diabetes treat-
ment categories were diet and lifestyle modification, oral hy-
poglycemic agents, insulin only, or insulin with oral hypogly-
cemicagents.Useofstatins,antihypertensives,andaspirinwas
dichotomized. Smoking was coded as positive if the indi-
vidual was a current smoker.
Comorbidities, Events, and Vital Status
Data on comorbidities and events were collected at baseline
and during follow-up by linking the NDR to the Inpatient Reg-
ister and the Cause of Death Register, both of which are main-
Key Points
Question How important is socioeconomic status in type 2
diabetes?
Findings In this nationwide study in Sweden, low socioeconomic
status was associated with almost a 2-fold risk of all-cause,
cardiovascular, and diabetes-related mortality but was not as
strong as a predictor of death from cancer. Controlling for
well-recognized risk factors did not eliminate the disparities;
however, non-Western immigrants displayed a substantially lower
risk of most outcomes.
Meaning Socioeconomic disparities in survival in type 2 diabetes
are pronounced and may not be eliminated by conventional risk
factor control.

tained by the National Board of Health and Welfare. The In-
patient Register includes mandatory information on all
principal and secondary hospital discharge diagnoses and has
had near-complete coverage since 1987. Codes from the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases are used to classify diagno-
ses in the Inpatient Register, which has been validated.18
ThefollowingInternationalClassificationofDiseases,Ninth
Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of
Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes were collected: coro-
nary heart disease, 410-414 (ICD-9) and I20-I25 (ICD-10); acute
myocardialinfarction,410(ICD-9)andI21(ICD-10);stroke,431-
434, 436 (ICD-9), and I61-I64 (ICD-10); hospitalization for heart
failure,428(ICD-9)andI50(ICD-10);andatrialfibrillation,427D
(ICD-9) and I48 (ICD-10). For renal dialysis and transplant, the
following codes were used: V42A, V45B, V56A, and V56W
(ICD-9)andZ94.0,Z49,andZ99.2(ICD-10).Stage5chronickid-
ney disease was defined as the need for renal dialysis or renal
transplant or estimated glomerular filtration rate less than
15 mL/min/1.73 kg.
The outcomes assessed were all-cause, CV (ICD-10
codes I00-I99), and cancer mortality (ICD-10 codes C00-
C97). Post hoc assessment included diabetes-related death
(ICD-10 codes E10-E14) and the following cancers: prostate
(ICD-10 code C61); breast (ICD-10 code C50); lung and tra-
cheal (ICD-10 codes C33-C34); gastrointestinal (ICD-10 codes
C15-C21); liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and biliary tract
(ICD-10 codes C22-C26); and kidney and urinary system
(ICD-10 codes C64-C68).
Allindividualsweremonitoredfrombaselineuntilanevent
or death through December 31, 2012. Median follow-up was
5.6 years.
Statistical Analysis
Crude mortality rates are described as events per 1000 person-
years. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression
model was used to perform survival analyses. We computed
3 sequentially adjusted models for each outcome. Model 1 was
identical for all outcomes and included age, sex, duration of
diabetes, marital status, income, educational level, and coun-
try of birth. Covariate adjustment in the remaining models dif-
fered slightly to suit the outcome.
For all-cause mortality, model 2 was additionally
adjusted for smoking, hemoglobin A1c, estimated glomeru-
lar filtration rate, diabetes treatment, and body mass index.
Model 3 was also adjusted for albuminuria, heart failure,
myocardial infarction, stroke, stage 5 chronic kidney dis-
ease, and cancer at baseline. Adjustments to models 2 and 3
for CV mortality were identical to all-cause mortality except
that previous cancer was not included. Adjustments to
models 2 and 3 for cancer mortality were identical to all-
cause mortality.
For diabetes-related death, we computed one model
that included the same covariates as model 3 for CV mortal-
ity. Similarly, for specific cancers, only one model was used,
and it was adjusted for the same covariates as model 3 for
overall cancer mortality. Competing risks were not taken
into consideration since we were interested in estimating
only cause-specific hazards.
Results
Baseline Clinical Characteristics
Characteristics of the population are presented in Table 1 and
eTables 1 to 4 in the Supplement. Of the 217 364 persons in-
cluded in the study, the mean (SD) age was 58.3 (9.3) years and
130 839 of the population (60.2%) was male. Individuals who
were married were older, had higher educational levels, were
more frequently born outside of Sweden, and had more coex-
isting conditions compared with those who were single. Indi-
viduals in quintile 5 (highest income) had more favorable char-
acteristics than those in quintile 1 (lowest income). Individuals
fromnon-Westerncountries(1699[9.7%]originatedfromLatin
America and the Caribbean; 2902 [16.5%] from East or South
Asia; 10 506 [59.7%] from the Middle East or North Africa; and
2482 [14.1%] from Sub-Saharan Africa) were younger than na-
tive Swedes (mean [SD], 52.1 [9.8] vs 58.8 [9.2] years). Non-
Western immigrants were approximately 6 years younger at
diagnosis of diabetes and had lower income, higher educa-
tional levels, and a higher prevalence of albuminuria. As pre-
sented in eTable 5 in the Supplement, there were no notewor-
thy differences regarding the number of entries in the register
per year regarding socioeconomic categories.
Unadjusted Mortality Rates
There were a total of 19 105 all-cause deaths with 11 423
(59.8%), 6984 (36.6%), and 6438 (33.7%) CV, diabetes-
related, or cancer deaths, respectively. Unadjusted mortality
rates are presented in Table 2. Mortality increased gradually
with declining income. In quintile 5, there were 8.92 deaths
per 1000 person-years (highest income) compared with
18.33 deaths per 1000 person-years in quintile 1 (lowest
income) with comparable age distribution. The age of indi-
viduals with 10 to 12 years of education was comparable to
the age of those with a college/university degree. The latter
category had lower rates for all outcomes. Persons from
high-income Europe, low-income Europe, Sweden, and Nor-
dic countries were of similar ages. Individuals from Nordic
countries had higher incidence rates for all outcomes. The
mean ages of married and divorced individuals were nearly
the same (59.3 vs 59.2 years). The mortality rate was 13.00
deaths per 1000 person-years among married individuals
compared with 18.82 deaths per 1000 person-years among
those who were divorced.
Adjusted HRs for All-Cause Mortality
Figure 1 presents the HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality.
Being single was the reference group for marital status. The
HR for individuals who were married was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.70-
0.77) in model 3, which was similar to the estimates in mod-
els 1 (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.67-0.73]) and 2 (HR, 0.71 [95% CI,
0.67-0.74]). Being widowed was associated with a slightly el-
evated risk in model 1 (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.02-1.16]), but the
statistical significance was eliminated in models 2 (HR, 1.02
[95% CI, 0.95-1.10]) and 3 (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.97-1.14]). The
HRinmodel3forindividualswhoweredivorcedwas0.94(95%

served as the reference group for income. The HR for death in-
creased gradually with declining income. In the fully
adjusted model (model 3), the HRs for individuals in quin-
tiles 1 and 2 were 1.71 (95% CI, 1.60-1.83) and 1.68 (95% CI, 1.58-
1.80), respectively.
The effect of education was robust against covariate
adjustment. Compared with having 9 years or less of
education, HRs for individuals with 10 to 12 years of educa-
tion and those with a college/university degree were
0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.93) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.90),
respectively (model 3). Similarly, the association between
country of birth and death withstood covariate adjustment.
In model 3, HRs for individuals born in low-income
European or non-Western countries were 0.72 (95% CI,
0.62-0.83) and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.48-0.63), respectively.
Adjusted HRs for CV Death
For CV death, we noted the same associations as for all-
cause mortality, but the differences were slightly more pro-
nounced. The HR for married individuals compared with
those who were single, determined using the fully adjusted
model, was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.63-0.71). Individuals in the 2
lowest income quintiles had an almost 90% elevated risk of
CV death compared with those in the highest income quin-
tile. The HR for the lowest vs highest income quintile was
1.87 (95% CI, 1.72-2.05) and for the second lowest vs highest
income quintile was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.72-2.03). Hazard ratios
for persons with a college/university degree compared
with those having 9 years or less education was 0.84 (95%
CI, 0.78-0.91). The HR for non-Western immigrants com-
pared with native Swedes was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.38-0.56)
(Figure 2).
Adjusted HRs for Diabetes-Related Death
Hazard ratios for diabetes-related death in the fully adjusted
model are presented in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. We
noted associations similar to those of all-cause mortality.
Using the same reference groups for all-cause mortality, we
found that individuals who were married displayed an HR
of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.57-0.67). Being in the lowest income
quintile yielded an HR of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.61-2.01). Non-
Western immigrants displayed an HR of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.29-
0.49), which was the lowest observed in the present
study.

Death From Any Cancer
Therewasnostatisticallysignificantassociationbetweenmari-
talstatusanddeathfromanycancer(Figure3).Individualsinin-
come quintiles 1, 2, and 3 had approximately the same elevated
risk (30% higher) of death from cancer compared with those in
the highest income quintile. The HR for persons with a college/
university degree was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93) compared with
having 9 years or less of education. A smaller but significant re-
ductioninriskwasalsonotedforindividualswith10to12years
ofeducation.ComparedwithnativeSwedes,personsfromnon-
Western countries had an HR of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58-0.88).
Death From Specific Cancers
Hazard ratios are presented in eFigure 2 to eFigure 7 in the
Supplement. Compared with men who were single, those who
were married displayed an HR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.50-0.90) for
death from prostate cancer; the HR in men with 10 to 12 years
of education was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.60-0.99). Remaining socio-
economic status variables were not associated with a risk of
prostate cancer (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
None of the socioeconomic status variables were associ-
ated with the risk of breast cancer. However, there was a ten-
dency for increasing risk with declining income (eFigure 3 in
the Supplement) in the judgment of point estimates.
Being divorced, having a low income, or being born in
nearby Nordic countries were each associated with higher risks
for lung and tracheal cancer. The HR for individuals with a col-
lege/university degree compared with those who had 9 years
or less of education was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.44-0.76) (eFigure 4
in the Supplement).
Compared with the highest income quintile, all other in-
come groups displayed a 30% to 50% elevated risk of death
from gastrointestinal cancers. Being well educated appeared
to be associated with a lower risk of the outcome, although sta-
tistical significance was absent. The HR for non-Western im-
migrants compared with Swedish natives was 0.54 (95% CI,
0.31-0.93) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Socioeconomic status was not associated with death from
kidney and urinary tract cancer except for individuals in the
second highest income quintile, who displayed a lower risk
than persons in the highest income quintile (eFigure 6 in the
Supplement).Lowincomewasassociatedwithanelevatedrisk
ofdeathfromcancerintheliver,pancreas,orbiliarytract(eFig-
ure 7 in the Supplement).

Previous studies9,11 have shown that low socioeconomic
status is associated with mortality from diabetes, but these
studies did not adjust for important covariates, did not have
accesstodetailedindividual-levelsocioeconomicdata,orwere
conducted in a setting in which access to health care is ineq-
uitable. The present study overcame these obstacles and as-
sessed cancer mortality to show the greater effect of socio-
economic factors on CV outcomes.
The mechanisms by which socioeconomic status exert an
influence have been extensively studied.20-23 Absence of so-
cioeconomic privilege is coupled with psychosocial stress, un-
employment, financial difficulties, unhealthy habits, health
obstacles, living in an at-risk neighborhood, lack of social sup-
port, and insufficient cohesion.

Swedish natives, non-Western immigrants had a lower income
and higher educational level but a lower risk of virtually all out-

Model 1 was identical for all outcomes and included age, sex, duration of
diabetes, marital status, income, educational level, and country of birth. Model
2 was further adjusted for smoking, hemoglobin A1c level, estimated glomerular
filtration rate, diabetes treatment, and body mass index. Model 3 was further
adjusted for albuminuria, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, stage 5
chronic kidney disease, and cancer at baseline.

a range of outcomes, and, perhaps even more intriguing, is not
affected by adjustment for well-recognized risk factors and co-
morbidities.
The study has limitations. Because of its observational de-
sign,wecannotexcluderesidualconfounding.Althoughthere-
gression methods and number and quality of included vari-
ables restrict residual confounding, they do not correct for
confounding factors that were not considered. We did not have
accesstodataonalcoholconsumption,andinformationregard-
ing smoking was limited to a dichotomous variable. Further-
more, the epidemiologic definition of type 2 diabetes makes it
possiblethatpersonswithautoimmune(ie,type1)diabetesmay
have been included in the cohort, provided that they had dis-
ease onset after age 40 years. However, we compared this defi-
nitionwiththephysician’
sclassificationofdiabetestype(which
is available in the NDR), and the epidemiologic definition was
concordant with the physician’
s in 95% of the cases.
Conclusions
In this nationwide study in Sweden, where access to and use
of health care resources is equitable and affordable and man-
agement is well developed, low socioeconomic status was as-
sociated with a 2-fold risk of all-cause, CV, and diabetes-
related mortality. A significant but less pronounced increased
risk of death from cancer was also noted. Controlling for con-
ventional risk factors does not eliminate these disparities, but
socioeconomically tailored management and aggressive treat-
ment are likely to reduce them.
