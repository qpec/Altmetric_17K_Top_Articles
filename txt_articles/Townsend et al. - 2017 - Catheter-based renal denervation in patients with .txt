SUMMARY   (322 of 300 words) 
38 
BACKGROUND: Previous randomised renal denervation studies failed to show consistent efficacy 
39 
benefit in reducing blood pressure (BP).  
40 
METHODS: SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED is a multicentre, international, single-blind, randomised, sham-
41 
controlled, proof of concept trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02439749). The objective was to evaluate the 
42 
effect of renal denervation on BP in the absence of anti-hypertensive medications. Patients were enrolled 
43 
at 21 centres in the USA, Europe, Japan and Australia. Eligible patients were drug naïve or discontinued 
44 
their anti-hypertensive medications. Patients with an office systolic BP (SBP) ≥150 mmHg and <180 
45 
mmHg, a diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mmHg and a 24-hour ambulatory SBP ≥140 mmHg and <170 mmHg at 
46 
second screening underwent renal angiography and were randomised to renal denervation or sham 
47 
control. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing BP were blinded to randomisation assignments. Changes 
48 
in office and 24-hour BP at three months were compared between groups. Drug surveillance was 
49 
employed to ensure patient compliance with medication withdrawalabsencse. Safety events were assessed 
50 
through three months.   
51 
FINDINGS: Eighty patients were randomiszed and followed through three months. Office and 24-hour 
52 
ambulatory BP decreased significantly from baseline to three months in the renal denervation group 
53 
(n=38); 24-hour SBP (-5·5 mmHg [-9·1, -2·0]), 24-hour DBP (-4·8 mmHg [-7·0, -2·6]), office SBP (-
54 
10·0 mmHg [-15·1, -4·9]), and office DBP (-5·3 mmHg [-7·8, -2·7]).   There were no significant changes 
55 
in the sham-control group (n=42); 24-hour SBP (-0·5 mmHg [-3·9, 2·9]), 24-hour DBP (-0·4 mmHg [-
56 
2·2, 1·4]), office SBP (-2·3 mmHg [-6·1, 1·6]), and office DBP (-0·3 mmHg [-2·9, 2·2]).  The difference 
57 
between groups favoured renal denervation for both office and 24-hour three-month change from 
58 
baseline; 24-hour SBP (-5·0 mmHg [-9·9, -0·2]), 24-hour DBP (-4·4 mmHg [-7·2, -1·6]), office SBP (-
59 
7·7 mmHg [-14·0, -1·5]) and office DBP (-4·9 [-8·5, -1·4]). Baseline-adjusted analysis gave very similar 
60 
findings. There were no major adverse events in either group.

INTERPRETATION: Results from SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED provide biologic proof of principle for 
62 
the BP lowering efficacy of renal denervation.

INTRODUCTION 
66 
While the ability of renal denervation to decrease renal and systemic sympathetic tone was established by 
67 
Esler et al1 and early clinical trials were promising2,3 , The encouraging results reported from the 
68 
SYMPLICITY HTN-1 and HTN-2 trials1,2 led to substantial interest in percutaneous renal denervation as 
69 
a potential device related non-pharmacological method to treat hypertension.  However, despite meeting 
70 
its safety endpoint, the randomised, blinded, sham-controlled SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial failed to 
71 
demonstrate a statistically significant blood pressure lowering effect of renal denervation when compared 
72 
with sham treatment.4 Post-hoc sub-analyses suggested postulated that variance in medication adherence, 
73 
incomplete renal denervation of the renal arteries and the inclusion of patients with isolated systolic 
74 
hypertension might have contributed to the surprisingly absence of an observable blood pressure 
75 
reduction.5 Hence, the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED was initiated to demonstrate that renal denervation 
76 
could indeed impact blood pressure in a blinded, sham-controlled study. A new proof of concept trial was 
77 
warranted due to dramatic trial design differences from previous studies.  These differences included the 
78 
unknown impact on BPblood pressure reduction due to a different population (not “treatment resistant”), 
79 
unknown impact on blood pressureBP reduction of a new procedure, and unknown impact on the 
80 
variability of what had previously been a secondary endpoint but was now the main focus of measurement 
81 
, namely 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Since the actual blood pressure 
82 
reduction relative to sham could not be predicted, a study of 120 evaluable patients randomised 1:1 was 
83 
designed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful signal focused on ABPM.  
84 
 Given the uncertainty of both the blood pressure reduction and standard deviation, analyses were pre-
85 
specified at 40, 60, 80, and/or 100 subjects followed to three months so that if a clinically meaningful 
86 
reduction was observed there could be rapid advancement to design and initiation of a powered, pivotal 
87 
study.  We present here the primary three-month analysis of  the 80 subjects enrolled in the SPYRAL 
88 
HTN-OFF MED trial.

METHODS 
91 
Trial design and patients 
92 
The design of the multicentre, international, single-blind, randomised, sham-controlled SPYRAL HTN-
93 
OFF MED proof of concept trial has been described previously and is illustrated in appendix Figure S1.68 
94 
Briefly, we enrolled patients 20 to 80 years old with mild to moderate hypertension, defined as office 
95 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥150 and <180 mmHg, office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg, 
96 
and a mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP ≥140 and <170 mmHg. Patients were enrolled at 21 centres: ten in 
97 
the USA, four in Germany, two in Japan, two in the United Kingdom, one in Australia, one in Austria, 
98 
and one in Greece. The trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, all local ethics committees 
99 
approved the research protocol and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The trial is 
100 
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02439749. 
101 
 
102 
Screening and randomisation 
103 
Randomisation to renal denervation or sham procedure was stratified by trial centre at a 1:1 ratio, using 
104 
block randomisation with a block size of four. Randomisation was performed by ICON plc using SAS-
105 
based software to generate the lists of randomisation codes. Participants were assigned to interventions 
106 
through ICON’s website. Prior to randomisation, patients were required to be off all anti-hypertensive 
107 
medications (Figure S1).68 An initial screening visit was conducted to verify initial eligibility criteria and 
108 
initiate medication washout, if needed.   
109 
After a three- to four-week period of medication washout, screening visit two confirmed patients’ 
110 
eligibility for randomisation. Absence of anti-hypertensive medication usage was evaluated using tandem 
111 
high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy of urine and plasma by an independent 
112 
laboratory.79  Office blood pressure and heart rate measurements were obtained using an automatic blood 
113 
 7 
 
pressure monitor (Omron, see appendix), and patients whose office blood pressure remained within range 
114 
(SBP ≥150 mmHg and <180 mmHg and DBP ≥90 mmHg) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
115 
monitoring (ABPM; Mobil-O-Graph; I.E.M GmbH, Stolberg, Germany).  Blood pressure was measured 
116 
every 30 minutes and a minimum of 21 daytime (7:00 to 21:59) and 12 night-time (22:00 to 6:59) 
117 
measurements were required for inclusion in the analysis.  Patients had one opportunity to repeat ABPM 
118 
data collection if they failed to record 21 daytime and 12 night-time readings, or the average 24-hour SBP 
119 
was between 135-140 or 170-175 mmHg.  Mean 24-hour heart rate was also determined from the ABPM 
120 
record as the average of all heart rates measured during the cuff pressure measurement cycle. 
121 
Patients who satisfied all inclusion and exclusion criteria at the second screening visit were scheduled for 
122 
renal angiogram and, if anatomical suitability was confirmed, proceeded to randomisation.  
123 
Procedure 
124 
The Symplicity SpyralTM multielectrode catheter (Medtronic, Galway, Ireland), and the Symplicity G3TM 
125 
generator were used to provide radiofrequency ablation treatments. The four electrodes on the catheter are 
126 
positioned to apply radiofrequency energy circumferentially in all four quadrants of the renal artery and 
127 
branch vessels (Figure 1). All proceduralists had prior renal denervation experience and all cases were 
128 
proctored based on detailed pre-specified treatment plans including a standardized approach to all 
129 
accessible renal arterial vessels, including branch vessels and accessory arteries having a diameter of 
130 
greater than three and less than eight mm.  To minimize procedural variability, the number of 
131 
proceduralists was restricted to one per trial centre.   
132 
In the control group, the sham procedure consisted of only a renal angiogram. Patients were also required 
133 
to remain on the procedure table for at least 20 minutes post-angiogram to help prevent possible 
134 
unblinding of randomisation allocation.  
135 
 
136 
Follow-up 
137 
 8 
 
Patients’ blood pressure was assessed at two-week intervals post-randomisation to ensure safety.  If a 
138 
patient’s SBP surpassed the pre-specified escape criteria threshold (≥180 mmHg), and this was confirmed 
139 
by repeated measurement within 72 hours, they could receive anti-hypertensive drug therapy at the 
140 
discretion of the investigator. Otherwise, patients remained off anti-hypertensive medications post-
141 
randomisation until follow-up at three months, when a prespecified drug titration protocol was initiated if 
142 
SBP was greater than 140 mmHg. 
143 
 
144 
Maintenance of blinding  
145 
Trial patients were not informed of their randomisation assignments and were blinded during the renal 
146 
angiogram by a combination of conscious sedation, sensory isolation (blindfolding and music), and lack 
147 
of familiarity to the procedural details and duration of the angiogram (i.e., patients were not expected to 
148 
know the difference between the renal angiography procedure alone and the renal angiography and 
149 
denervation procedure).  The proceduralist performing the angiogram and designated trial staff were 
150 
blinded to the randomisation assignment until the angiography was completed and inclusion/exclusion 
151 
criteria were confirmed.  Blinded trial staff conducted all trial follow-up visits and the patient’s 
152 
referring/managing physicians were not informed of a patient’s treatment assignment. Per protocol, 
153 
blinding of patients and BP assessors was maintained to 12 months post-randomisation. Patients were 
154 
asked to guess which randomisation group they were in at discharge and three months to evaluate the 
155 
strength of the blinding procedures.  
156 
 
157 
Efficacy endpoints 
158 
The primary efficacy endpoint of blood pressure reduction based on ABPM measurements was assessed 
159 
at three months, judged to be an acceptable amount of time for patients to withhold their anti-hypertensive 
160 
medications and to observe a decrease in blood pressure. The change from baseline (blood pressure 
161 
 9 
 
measured at screening visit two) in SBP and DBP measurements obtained in-office and with 24-hour 
162 
ABPM was assessed for the renal denervation and sham control groups at three-months post 
163 
randomisation. The three-month change in BP measurements were then compared between the two 
164 
treatment groups in order to assess if the ABPM sham-control subtracted SBP and the corresponding 
165 
standard deviation was sufficient to justify design of a larger, powered pivotal trial. Continued absence of 
166 
anti-hypertensive medication usage was assessed by urine and plasma sampling at baseline and at three 
167 
months. Plasma samples were also analysed for sodium, potassium, renin activity, aldosterone, serum 
168 
creatinine, and other relevant laboratory values. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 
169 
calculated using the four variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Formula or the local 
170 
Japanese criteria for patients enrolled in Japan.810  
171 
 
172 
Safety endpoints 
173 
Safety endpoints collected at three months included all-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease, any 
174 
significant embolic event resulting in end-organ damage, hospitalization for hypertensive crises not 
175 
related to medication nonadherence, new myocardial infarction, new stroke, renal artery re-intervention, 
176 
major bleeding, major vascular complications and increase in serum creatinine >50% from screening 
177 
assessment. End-stage renal disease is defined as two or more eGFR measurements <15 mL/min/1·73 m2 
178 
at least 21 days apart and requiring dialysis.  
179 
 
180 
Statistical analysis 
181 
The current proof-of-concept trial was designed in collaboration with the FDA and influenced by 
182 
recommendations in the 2014 Scientific Statement by the American Society of Hypertension9  which 
183 
suggested a Phase Two- type trial in a small group of patients. To conduct a properly powered

after this decision point are planned to be included in the pivotal dataset, as discussed with the FDA, and 
189 
thus this report represents the primary results of the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial.  
190 
There are no powered endpoints in the trial. To conduct a properly powered randomised trial assuming a 5 
191 
mmHg SBP reduction with a standard deviation of 12, it was determined that 246 patients would be 
192 
required. Considering the failure of SYMPLICITY HTN-3 it was agreed to proceed with a smaller proof 
193 
of concept trial that would minimize exposure of patients to an interventional procedure and provide 
194 
sufficient evidence to move forward with a larger, powered trial. Statistical analyses were performed 
195 
based on the intention-to-treat principle. A modified intention-to-treat cohort excluded patients who met 
196 
escape criteria (SBP ≥180 mmHg). For patients meeting escape criteria, the last observation was carried 
197 
forward for three-month blood pressure assessment. A per-protocol analysis was also performed which 
198 
excluded patients meeting escape criteria, who had antihypertensive medications measured in urine or 
199 
serum, and who had at least one non-standardized blood pressure assessment. To adjust for baseline blood 
200 
pressure measurements, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was employed as an additional analysis of 
201 
blood pressure changes. 
202 
Means and standard deviations of continuous variables are presented per treatment group. Between group 
203 
differences and differences from baseline to the three-month follow-up assessment were tested with the 
204 
use of unpaired and paired t-tests, respectively. For categorical variables, counts and percentages are 
205 
presented per treatment group; values were tested with the use of the exact test for binary variables and 
206 
the chi-square test for multilevel categorical variables. All reported subgroup analyses were prespecified.  
207 
Commented [FM[1]: We have 90% power with 246 
patients under these assumptions. 
 11 
 
Correlation of office with 24-hour SBP measurements per patient was analysed using regression methods. 
208 
A blinding index, based on responses to a questionnaire, was calculated at hospital discharge and at three 
209 
months to verify the effectiveness of blinding.101  
210 
Role of the funding source 
211 
The SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial was funded by Medtronic (Santa Rosa, CA, USA). The trial 
212 
executive committee designed the protocol in conjunction with the funder. The funder was responsible for 
213 
selection of clinical sites, in collaboration with the executive committee, as well as collection, monitoring 
214 
and analysis of the data. The manuscript was written by the lead author with substantial contributions 
215 
from the executive committee and co-authors. The funder assisted in figure and table generation, copy 
216 
editing and formatting. The authors had unrestricted access to the data and had full responsibility for the 
217 
decision to submit for publication.   
218 
 
219 
RESULTS 
220 
The current analysis presents results from the first 80 patients randomised (38 to renal denervation and 42 
221 
to sham) from a total of 353 patients enrolled and screened between June 2015 and May 2017 (Figure 2). 
222 
At the interim analysis of 80 patients, a reduction in BP, as well as in variability of 24-hour BP 
223 
measurements was seen; all patients randomised after these 80 patients will contribute to the pivotal 
224 
dataset. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics, weight, heart rate, office, 
225 
or mean 24-hour SBP and DBP between the renal denervation and sham control groups although there 
226 
were more current smokers in the sham-control group than the renal denervation group (23.8% vs 10.5%) 
227 
(Table 1).  
228 
 
229 
All patients underwent aortography and selective renal angiography. Angiographic documentation of 
230 
catheter position for the renal denervation group was required.  During the procedure, a mean of 251·0 ± 
231 
99·4 cc of contrast was used in the renal denervation group and 83·3 ± 38·5 cc in the sham control group. 
232 
 12 
 
For the renal denervation group, on a patient basis, proceduralists performed an average of 43·8 ± 13·1 
233 
total ablations, and treated an average of 2·2 main arteries (17·9 ± 10·5 ablations) and 5·2 branch vessels 
234 
(25·9 ± 12·8 ablations).  
235 
The blinding index was 0·65 (0·56, 0·75) at discharge and 0·59 (0·49, 0·70) at three months, indicating 
236 
proper blinding.101  
237 
 
238 
Drug testing was performed at baseline and three months to identify whether patients were taking any 
239 
anti-hypertensive medications. At baseline, 92·1% (35/38) of renal denervation patients and 88·1% 
240 
(37/42) of sham control patients had no evidence of anti-hypertensive medication use (p=0·72). At three 
241 
months, for available data, 94·3% (33/35) of renal denervation and 92·7% (38/41) of sham control 
242 
patients had no anti-hypertensive medications detected (p>0·99). Overall compliance with the 
243 
requirement to be off antihypertensive medications at baseline and 3 months was 85.5%.  Of the six 
244 
patients who met escape criteria following randomiszation, three had drugs measured at three months, 
245 
drugs were not detected in two patients, and one patient did not undergo drug testing.  There were no 
246 
significant differences in baseline laboratory values or in the three-month change in values between the 
247 
renal denervation and sham control groups (Appendix, Table S2).   
248 
 
249 
The three month SBP and DBP change from baseline for both 24-hour ambulatory and office 
250 
measurements in the renal denervation and sham control groups is displayed in Figure 3, and Table 2.  
251 
The change in blood pressure was greater at three months for the renal denervation group vs. sham control 
252 
for 24-hour ambulatory SBP (difference -5·0 mmHg [-9·9, -0·2], p=0·04) as well as office SBP 
253 
(difference -7·7 mmHg [-14·0, -1·5], p=0·02). The same was documented for 24-hour DBP (difference -
254 
4·4 mmHg [-7·2, -1·6] p=0·002) and office DBP (difference -4·9 mmHg [-8·5, -1·4] p=0·008). 
255 
Comparison of office and 24-hour blood pressure measurements at baseline and three months for renal 
256 
denervation and sham control groups are included in appendix Table S3.  
257 
 
258 
 13 
 
Comparison of three-month change, adjusted for baseline measures using ANCOVA, provide similar 
259 
results with a 24-hour SBP between group difference of -4.6 mmHg [-9·2, 0·1], p=0·053 and 24-hour 
260 
DBP between group difference of -4·3 mmHg [-7·1, -1·5], p=0·003.  Office SBP difference was -7·1 [-
261 
13·2, -1·1], p=0·021 and office DBP difference was -5·0 mmHg [-8·6, -1·4], p=0·008 (Table 2).  Results 
262 
were consistent using unadjusted and baseline-adjusted analysis for the modified ITT and per-protocol 
263 
populations (Appendix Table S4). 
264 
 
265 
Individual patient responses to renal denervation or sham procedure via office and 24-hour BP 
266 
measurements are illustrated in Figure 4.  As expected, the three-month change in blood pressure after 
267 
renal denervation was correlated between 24-hour and office measurements (r=0·41, p=0·01) but this 
268 
correlation was not observed in the sham control group (r=0·06, p=0·72) (Appendix Figure S2).    
269 
 
270 
There were no major procedural or clinical safety events in either the renal denervation or sham control 
271 
groups out to three months (Appendix Table S5). Specifically, there were no cases of death or 
272 
occurrences of myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding, serum creatinine elevation >50%, 
273 
significant embolic events, vascular complications, renal artery re-intervention, new or worsening renal 
274 
failure, or hypertensive emergency/crisis.  
275

277 
DISCUSSION 
278 
This novel trial differs substantially from previous renal denervation trials in the hypertensive population 
279 
enrolled, the renal denervation technique employed, and the absence of concomitant anti-hypertensive 
280 
medications. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorously conducted sham controlled clinical trial to 
281 
assess BP reduction in hypertensive patients in the absence of anti-hypertensive medications. These data 
282 
provide the biologic proof of principle that renal denervation as performed in this trial lowers blood 
283 
 14 
 
pressure in untreated hypertensive patients and supports the prior data from Esler et al about the 
284 
correlation of reduction in sympathetic tone and blood pressure reduction.1 While not powered for 
285 
efficacy endpoints,  a substantial difference in both office and mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP and DBP 
286 
change was observed between the renal denervation and sham control groups at three months. In addition, 
287 
the renal denervation group had significant changes from baseline to three months in office and mean 24-
288 
hour ambulatory blood pressures. Of note, the sham control group had a small, non-significant change in 
289 
blood pressure.  
290 
 
291 
A new proof of concept trial was warranted due to substantial trial design differences from the previous 
292 
SYMPLICITY HTN-1 proof of concept trial112 based on key learnings from subsequent clinical 
293 
trials. The current trial design was influenced by several key learnings. These included recent advances in 
294 
our understanding of renal nerve anatomy12, the potential impact of concurrent drug therapy54,13, the 
295 
importance of operator experience and an individual procedural treatment plan14, and the biological 
296 
difference between combined systolic-diastolic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension (office 
297 
DBP <90 mmHg with a SBP ≥140 mmHg).155  Most prior renal denervation trials enrolled patients with 
298 
resistant1,3,42,3,15 or moderate hypertension13,16 while patients continued their anti-hypertensive regimen 
299 
without excluding isolated systolic hypertension patients. Unlike earlier SYMPLICITY trials that utilized 
300 
a single electrode renal denervation catheter in main renal arteries exclusively, the current trial utilized a 
301 
multi-electrode catheter that delivered up to four simultaneous, radiofrequency ablations in a helical 
302 
pattern and included branch vessel treatment. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the effect of 
303 
different catheters and treatment protocols on efficacy of BP reduction.  
304 
Elimination of anti-hypertensive medications as a confounding factor in the evaluation of efficacy of renal 
305 
denervation was important as adherence to anti-hypertensive medications has been well documented to be 
306 
unpredictable over time in hypertension clinical studies17,18 and specifically in renal denervation clinical 
307 
 15 
 
studies.19,20  Several hypertension studies found an association between a higher number of detected anti-
308 
hypertensive medications and lower blood pressure in patients,12,20−23 underscoring the importance of 
309 
objective measurement of medication adherence in an interventional therapy trial. The standard deviations 
310 
for blood pressure change were notably tighter in this compared tothan in previous trials and may be 
311 
attributed to removing drug adherence confounding of blood pressure measurement, to patient selection, 
312 
as well as to proctoring to ensure consistency in performance of renal denervation and the addition of 
313 
branch vessel treatment.  Moreover, in the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial, despite known drug 
314 
surveillance, compliance with the requirement to remain off antihypertensive drugs through three months 
315 
was 85·5%, illustrating the value of drug surveillance.  
316 
Results from the current trial are supported by data from several important trials that suggest an effect of 
317 
renal denervation in treating hypertension. Symplicity HTN-1, an open-label proof-of-principle study, 
318 
was among the first to report a significant BP reductions in patients with resistant hypertension, that were 
319 
evident by 1 month and sustained through three years.2,11 The Renal Denervation for Hypertension 
320 
(DENERHTN) prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled trial reported a significant difference in 
321 
reduction in daytime ambulatory SBP after renal denervation plus antihypertensive medication compared 
322 
to a control medication alone group.24 A second recent retrospective, non-randomised analysis of renal 
323 
denervation in a non-medicated hypertensive population documented a reduction in 24-hour SBP of -5·7 
324 
mmHg after renal denervation treatment.25  
325 
The choice of 24-hour SBP as the primary endpoint resulted from consensus that it is less prone to bias,  
326 
and, due to the multiple measurements, not only better reflects a patient’s blood pressure but also 
327 
demonstrates less variability of measurement;9,29-31 for these reasons it was the endpoint recommended by 
328 
regulatory authorities including the FDA.  There was a significant correlation between ambulatory and 
329 
office blood pressure changes in patients after renal denervation. This observation suggests that either 
330 
measure may be appropriate for future clinical trials when office BP measurements are blinded. In line 
331 
with expectations, a numerically smaller decrease was observed in the 24-hour ambulatory measurements. 
332 
 16 
 
The minimal blood pressure reductions in the sham control group did not show a similar relationship 
333 
supporting the reduction of blood pressure specifically in response to renal denervation rather than other 
334 
confounding factors.  
335 
The magnitude of the presently observed SBP reductions in the renal denervation arm, -10·0 mmHg for 
336 
office (p<0·001) and -5·5 mmHg for 24-hour ABPM (p=0·003), represent clinically meaningful 
337 
reductions in blood pressure. Blood pressure reductions of similar magnitudes have been associated with 
338 
reduced rates of cardiovascular death, coronary death and stroke.32-3429−31 For example, a recent meta-
339 
analysis predicts an approximate 20% reduction in relative risk for cardiovascular events with the 
340 
presently observed 7.7 mmHg sham-adjusted reduction in office SBP.330  Likewise, the observed 
341 
reduction in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure is also associated with relative risk reductions and meets 
342 
the criteria recommended by an expert panel.27,29,35,366,32−34 It is noteworthy that unclear why there is a 
343 
greater reduction in DBP after renal denervation in our trial. It is possible that this is related to the 
344 
mechanism of action of renal denervation related to vascular tone or may be due to the exclusion of 
345 
patients with isolated hypertension, but this is only speculation at this point. 
346 
Changes in renal denervation procedural requirements in SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED may have also 
347 
contributed to the reduction in blood pressure observed in the treatment group. Based on more recent 
348 
preclinical and clinical data a greater number of ablations were delivered in a circumferential pattern 
349 
within the main artery, renal artery branches and accessory arteries of greater than three to less than eight 
350 
mm in diameter, whereas in previous studies only the main renal artery was treated, the total number of 
351 
ablations were fewer, ablations were not applied in a circumferential pattern and accessory renal arteries 
352 
were not treated.5,8,14 In SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED, 17·9 ± 10·5 ablations were attempted in the main 
353 
renal arteries and 25·9 ± 12·8 ablations in branch vessels as compared with 11·2 ± 2·8 ablation attempts 
354 
and no branch treatments in SYMPLICITY HTN-3. Nevertheless, not all patients responded to renal 
355 
denervation treatment in this trial, which could be explained by variations in the degree of renal nerve 
356 
innervation between patients,12 or differences in the underlying pathophysiology.  
357 
 17 
 
There are several limitations to our trial. As a feasibility proof of concept trial, it was designed with a small sample 
358 
size, and was not powered for statistical significance given the uncertainty of the placebo-subtracted 
359 
blood pressure reduction and of the standard deviation of these measurements. Some patients had anti-
360 
hypertensive medications measured in their urine or serum, met escape criteria, or had blood pressure 
361 
measured in a non-standardized manner; however, the findings were consistent in the primary intention to 
362 
treat analysis as well as the modified intention to treat and per protocol analyses when these patients were 
363 
excluded from analysis (Appendix Table S3). The three-month follow-up was relatively short; however, a 
364 
short off-med period was specified per-protocol for safety reasons. After three-months antihypertension 
365 
medications could be titrated as needed and thus there was not a substantial cohort of truly off-med 
366 
patients after this time point. While renal denervation was performed to achieve complete and 
367 
comprehensive denervation of the kidneys, no practical methods to verify nerve destruction are currently 
368 
available.  As previously described and similarly to trials of pharmacological therapies, not all 
369 
participants experienced a blood pressure reduction post-renal denervation treatment.  Furthermore, the 
370 
method employed in this trial may not be generalizable to other renal denervation technologies or other 
371 
populations not studied.  
372 
In conclusion, results from SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED provide biologic proof of principle for the efficacy 
373 
of catheter based renal denervation to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive subjects not treated with 
374 
antihypertensive medications. We demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in office and 24-hour 
375 
ambulatory SBP and DBP at three months in mild to moderate hypertensive patients following renal 
376 
denervation in the absence of anti-hypertensive medications that was not observed in the sham control 
377 
group. There were no major safety events in either group despite lack of pharmacologic therapy from 
378 
enrolment to three- month follow-up and a more aggressive renal denervation procedure that extended 
379 
into renal artery branch vessels. The results of this trial will be useful in informingserve as the basis to 
380 
inform on adesign of a  pivotal trial design.

Research in Context 
440 
Evidence before this study  
441 
Early uncontrolled and unblinded trials reported large reductions in blood pressure following renal 
442 
denervation in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. However, the results of the randomised, sham-
443 
controlled SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial showed no statistically significant blood pressure lowering benefits 
444 
over sham treatment although continued follow-up of patients from multiple studies has confirmed the 
445 
safety of renal denervation. Subsequent post-hoc analyses of SYMPLICITY HTN-3 suggested that 
446 
ablation of the renal nerves, patient non-adherence to anti-hypertensive medications and patient selection 
447 
might have impacted these results.  Continued pre-clinical and clinical research provided evidence for the 
448 
importance of circumferential ablations in both the main renal arteries and vessel branches.   
449 
Added value of this study  
450 
The SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial was designed to evaluate the effectfeasibility of renal denervation to 
451 
influence blood pressure in non-medicated patients with mild to moderate hypertension. While not 
452 
powered for efficacy endpoints, patients randomised to renal denervation experienced significant 
453 
reductions in office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure compared to much smaller, non-significant 
454 
blood pressure reductions in the sham control patients. These results provide the biologic proof of concept 
455 
for the effect of renal denervation on blood pressure when performed by the described method.  
456 
Implications of all the available evidence  
457 
The results of this proof of conceptfeasibility trial will inform the design of a larger pivotal trial that will 
458 
be important to establish the role of renal denervation in the treatment of hypertension.
