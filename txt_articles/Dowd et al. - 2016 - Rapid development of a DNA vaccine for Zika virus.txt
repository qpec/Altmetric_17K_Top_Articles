Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified as a cause of congenital disease during the explosive outbreak in
the Americas and Caribbean that began in 2015. Because of the ongoing fetal risk from endemic
disease and travel-related exposures, a vaccine to prevent viremia in women of childbearing
age and their partners is imperative. We found that vaccination with DNA expressing the
premembrane and envelope proteins of ZIKV was immunogenic in mice and nonhuman
primates, and protection against viremia after ZIKV challenge correlated with serum
neutralizing activity.These data not only indicate that DNA vaccination could be a successful
approach to protect against ZIKV infection, but also suggest a protective threshold of vaccine-
induced neutralizing activity that prevents viremia after acute infection.
T
he emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the
Americas and Caribbean follows a series
of global threats to public health from
mosquito-borne viral diseases over the past
three decades. Because of the profound im-
pact on individuals and society from a disabling
congenital disease caused by ZIKV infection in
pregnant women, the World Health Organiza-
tion declared ZIKV a global health emergency in
February 2016. Although it is likely that the in-
cidence of ZIKV infection will decline consider-
ably within 1 to 2 years (1), it is also likely that
ZIKV will become endemic in tropical and sub-
tropical regions, with sporadic outbreaks and po-
tential for spread into new geographical areas,
as observed with other emerging arboviruses such
as West Nile (WNV) and chikungunya. Therefore,
unless immunity is established before childbear-
ing age, pregnant women will continue to be at
risk for an infection that could harm their fetus.
Further, because men can harbor ZIKV in semen
for several months after a clinically unapparent
infection and can sexually transmit virus to a
pregnant partner (2), even women in nonendemic
regions will have some ongoing risk if exposed to
men who have traveled to endemic regions. These
characteristic features of transmission and disease
suggest that there will be an ongoing need for a
ZIKV vaccine to maintain a high level of immunity
in the general population and in travelers to endem-
ic regions to reduce the frequency of fetal infection.
To rapidly address the critical need for a preven-
tive vaccine to curtail the ongoing ZIKV outbreak
in the Americas, we chose a gene-based vaccine de-
livery approach that leverages our prior experience
with a DNA-based WNV vaccine (3). Advantages
of DNA vaccines include the ability to rapidly test
multiple candidate antigen designs, the ability to
rapidly produce material that conforms to good
manufacturing practices, an established safety
profile in humans, and a relatively straightforward
regulatory pathway into clinical evaluation.
Antigen design was guided by prior knowledge
about humoral immunity to flaviviruses. Vaccine-
elicited neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are asso-
ciated with protection from flavivirus-mediated
disease (4). Because the most potent monoclonal
flavivirus NAbs map to conformational epitopes
in domain III (DIII) of the envelope (E) protein
(5), or to more complex quaternary epitopes that
bridge between antiparallel E dimers or between
dimer rafts arrayed on the virus surface (6, 7), our
goal was to identify constructs that produced par-
ticles that faithfully captured the antigenic com-
plexity of infectious virions. Expression of the
structural proteins premembrane (prM) and E are
sufficient for the production and release of virus-like
subviralparticles(SVPs)withantigenicandfunctional
propertiessimilartothoseof infectious virions (8, 9).
To identify promising vaccine candidates, prM-
E constructs were synthesized and screened for
expression and efficiency of particle release from
transfected cells. prM-E sequences were inserted
into a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter–
containing vector (VRC8400) that has been eval-
uated clinically in several previousstudies (3, 10, 11).
These constructs are distinct from one reported in
recent studies by Larocca et al. (12) and Abbink et al.
(13) that was based on a Brazilian isolate (strain

Downloaded from 
 BeH815744) and did not express the first 93 amino
acids of prM, encoding only the short M peptide
that is the product of furin cleavage of prM during
natural infection. Because prM plays a critical role
in the folding of the E protein and the release of
particles from cells (14, 15), it is not known how
the antigenicity of that product compares to the
prM-E product described here. The prM-E se-
quence in the constructs used in this study was
selected from a French Polynesian isolate (strain
H/PF/2013) that is identical or highly related to
strains circulating in the Americas. Neutralization
studies using contemporary sera against tempo-
rally and geographically diverse strains indicate
that ZIKV exists as a single serotype, suggesting
that a single vaccine antigen will provide pro-
tection against all ZIKV strains (16). To improve
expression, the ZIKV prM signal sequence was
exchanged with the analogous region of Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV), as previously reported
(17), to create vector VRC5283 (Fig. 1A). VRC5283
was further modified to create a second prM-E
construct, VRC5288, in which the final 98 amino
acids of E, comprising the stem and transmem-
brane regions (ST-TM), were exchanged with
corresponding JEV sequences. This substitution
has been previously shown to improve SVP se-
cretion (18). Both vectors exhibited expression by
mammalian cells (Fig. 1B, right panel), with more
efficient SVP release into supernatants by VRC5288
(Fig. 1B, right panel, and Fig. 1C) (19). Electron
microscopic analysis of negative-stained puri-
fied VRC5288 SVP preparations revealed roughly
spherical particles that are consistent with the ap-
pearance of other flavivirus SVPs (Fig. 1D) (8, 20).
Next, we assessed the immunogenicity of each
DNA candidate in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.
Mice were immunized intramuscularly once with
50 mg of DNA in the quadriceps, using electropo-
ration, as previously described (21). Serum was
evaluated for binding to ZIKV SVPs by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (fig. S1A)
and neutralizing activity by using ZIKV reporter
virus particles (RVPs) (fig. S1, B to D) (16). Vac-
cination with either VRC5283 or VRC5288 elicited
ZIKV-specific NAbs after a single immunization,
with reciprocal EC50 (half-maximal inhibition
of virus infection) serum dilution titers up to
105 in C57BL/6 mice (fig. S1D). NAb titers were
similar in mice vaccinated with 2, 10, or 50 mg of
DNA (fig. S2) and were of similar magnitude to
titers induced by a previously described WNV
DNA vaccine (fig. S3) (3).
Immunogenicity in rhesus macaques was eval-
uated after delivering vaccine intramuscularly by
a needle-free injection device (PharmaJet) (Fig. 2
and figs. S4 and S5). Six animals per group re-
ceived two 1-mg (VRC5283) or 4-mg (VRC5283
and VRC5288) doses of vaccine at 0 and 4 weeks,
and one group received a single 1-mg dose of
VRC5288 at week 0. After a single dose of DNA,
binding and neutralizing antibodies were detect-
able by week 2 and peaked at week 3. All ZIKV
vaccine groups had significantly higher NAb re-
sponses than macaques that received VRC8400
control vector when comparing the area under
the curve (AUC) using a Kruskal-Wallis test (P =
0.022; Fig. 2D). Macaques that received a single
1-mg dose of VRC5288 had significantly lower
NAb titers than macaques that received two doses
of either vaccine at either dose level (P = 0.022).
There were no significant differences, when com-
paring the AUC, in NAb titers between animals
that received two doses of VRC5283 and animals
that received two doses of VRC5288. Sera collec-
ted at week 6 were also evaluated for NAb activity
by the conventional focus-reduction neutraliza-
tion test (FRNT) (22, 23) and a microneutraliza-
tion (MN) assay (12, 13, 24). The results of both the
FRNT and MN assays strongly correlated with
EC50 RVP values (fig. S6 and table S1), although the
RVP assay was more sensitive than the MN assay,
as demonstrated by the detection of neutralizing
activity in macaques that received only a single
1-mg dose of VRC5288 (average week 6 reciprocal
EC50 serum NAb titers of 322 versus <10 for RVP
and MN assays, respectively). Further comparison
of these assays showed that MN values above the
limit of detection corresponded more closely to
EC90 RVP values (1.3-fold average difference be-
tween RVP EC90 and MN EC50 versus 9.6-fold av-
erage difference between RVP EC50 and MN EC50
NAb titers for all animals at week 6). These data
indicate that both VRC5283 and VRC5288 elicit
substantial ZIKV-specific NAbs in macaques.
Eight weeks after the first immunization, all
animals were challenged subcutaneously with
103 focus-forming units (FFU) of the Puerto Rican
ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (GenBank identifier,
KU501215.1), and blood was collected daily for
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
analysis of ZIKV genome copies in plasma (13, 19).
Control animals showed a peak virus load (VL) at
day 3 or 4 of between 104 and 106 genome copies/
ml. Animals that received two 4-mg or 1-mg doses
of VRC5283 or two 4-mg doses of VRC5288 were
largely protected from viremia, with 17 of 18 ani-
mals having no detectable viremia (Fig. 3A). One
animal that received two 4-mg doses of VRC5288
had a low-level positive PCR in one of two assays
performed on day 3 and another positive blip at
day 7. All six animals that received a single 1-mg
dose of VRC5288 were viremic, with a peak VL at
day 3 of between 102 and 105 genome copies/ml.
This VL was significantly reduced relative to that
of animals that received two doses of VRC8400
control vector (comparing AUC by a Wilcoxon
exact test; two-sided P = 0.041). The cutoff for
low values has been established at <100 genome
copies/ml, so it cannot be ruled out that low-level
viremia may have occurred in other animals.
Of the animals that received two doses of vac-
cine, 17 of 18 (94%) had no detectable viremia
after challenge. The animal with blips above back-
ground levels at days 3 and 7, which received two
4-mg–doses of VRC5288, had a prechallenge re-
ciprocal EC50 NAb titer of 1218, which was among
the lowest titers of all those measured in the two-
dose vaccine groups (Fig. 4A). A probability ana-
lysis indicated that one could anticipate 70%
protection from viremia if a reciprocal EC50 serum
NAb titer of 1000 is achieved in the RVP assay
(Fig. 4B). This corresponds roughly to a reciprocal
EC50 MN titer of ~100 (fig. S6), which is similar to
the NAb titer that has been shown to prevent

 viremia in nonhuman primates passively treated
with immune serum (13).
Animals receiving a single 1-mg dose of VRC5288
had prechallenge reciprocal EC50 NAb titers mea-
sured by the RVP assay of between 203 and 417.
The two animals with the highest NAb activity
were the ones with delayed onset of viremia at
day 3. MN titers atthe 6-week time point, as noted
above, were undetectable in the group receiving
a single 1-mg dose, and these animals uniformly
had breakthrough infection (table S1). Therefore,
the larger dynamic range of the RVP assay will
allow a more precise definition of the protective
threshold needed to prevent viremia in a par-
ticular model or against a particular challenge
inoculum (figs. S5 and S7).
One concern that is routinely raised about vac-
cination against flaviviruses is the possibility of
enhanced disease if there is incomplete or waning
immunity, as observed in a subset of secondary
dengue virus infections (25). In this study, the
group that received a single 1-mg dose of VRC5288
had low, subprotective NAb levels that resulted
in breakthrough infections. In those animals, there
were reduced levels of viremia relative to unvac-
cinated controls and no visible signs of illness or
enhancement of replication. Retrospectively, we
also determined that one animal in the mock-
immunized control group and one in the single
1-mg–dose VRC5288 group with detectable levels
of ZIKV antibody binding, but no neutralizing ac-
tivityatweek 0,hadpreexistingWNV-specificNAbs
(fig. S8). The levels of virus replication in these
animals were near the group average, and there
was no evidence of disease enhancement in the
setting of prior flavivirus exposure.
Vaccine development for ZIKV must be spe-
cific and guided by an expanded understanding
of ZIKV virology, pathogenesis, immunity, and
transmission. It must also be strategic, matching
technical and manufacturing feasibility with the
target populations that will benefit most. In addi-
tion, to achieve both rapid deployment and long-
term protection, it should be staged. This means
that a rapid response to the global health emer-
gency may require a different vaccine approach
than the longer-term goal of achieving durable im-
munity in the general population as ZIKV becomes
a sporadic, endemic infection. Both VRC5288 and
VRC5283 will be evaluated in human trials. A
phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identi-
fier, NCT02840487) of VRC5288 has already
been launched to test a variety of regimens and
doses for safety and immunogenicity. These trials
constitute the initial efforts to define the level of

Fig. 3. ZIKV DNA vaccines reduce viremia in
ZIKV-challenged rhesus macaques. Eight weeks
afterthefirstvaccination,macaques werechallenged
with 103 FFU of ZIKVstrain PRVABC59. (A) qPCR of
the capsid gene was used to determine the number
of genome copies per milliliter on days 1 to 5 and 7
after challenge. Each line represents an individual
animal. (B) Mean viral load after challenge in each
group. Error bars represent SEM. The dashed line
indicates the limit of detection (100 copies/ml).
Any value below the limit of detection was assigned
a value half the limit of detection for graphing and
AUC calculation.
Fig. 4. Protection from ZIKV challenge correlates with NAb titers present at challenge. Animals
that had detectable viremia after challenge were analyzed with respect to prechallenge NAb activity.
(A) The reciprocal EC50 NAb titer of each animal is individually plotted to reflect whether infection
occurred. Lines represent individual animals. Protected (no detectable viremia) and infected (viremia
detectable on 2 successive days) animals are represented by gray and red lines, respectively.The sole
animal that received two 4-mg doses of VRC5288 and was found to have a low level of viremia on days
3 and 7 after challenge is denoted as “breakthrough” (circles with black outlines). (B) The probability of
protection (logit) based on the reciprocal EC50 NAb titer is shown and indicates that prevention of
viremia would be expected in ~70% of animals with NAb titers >1000.The colors of the circles indicate
vaccination group (black,VRC8400, 4 mg × 2; blue,VRC5283, 4 mg × 2; light blue,VRC5283, 1 mg × 2;
red, VRC5288, 4 mg × 2; pink, VRC5288, 1 mg × 1).
