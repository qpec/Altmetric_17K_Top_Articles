Abstract 
25 
PURPOSE A dramatic improvement in the survival of chronic myeloid leukemia 
26 
(CML) patients occurred after the introduction of imatinib myeselate (IM), the first 
27 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). We assess how these changes affect the life 
28 
expectancy of CML patients and life years lost due to a diagnosis of CML between 
29 
1973 and 2013 in Sweden. 
30 
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients recorded as having CML in the Swedish 
31 
Cancer registry from 1973 to 2013 were included in the study and followed until 
32 
death, censoring or end of follow-up. The life expectancy and loss in expectation of 
33 
life were predicted from a flexible parametric relative survival model.  
34 
RESULTS 2,662 CML patients were diagnosed between 1973 and 2013. Vast 
35 
improvements in the life expectancy of CML patients were seen over the study 
36 
period; larger improvements were seen in the youngest ages. The great 
37 
improvements in life expectancy translated into great reductions in the loss in 
38 
expectation of life. Patients of all ages diagnosed in 2013 will on average lose less 
39 
than 3 life years due to their diagnosis of CML. 
40 
CONCLUSION Imatinib mesylate, new TKIs along with allogeneic stem cell 
41 
transplantation and other factors have contributed to the life expectancy in CML 
42 
patients approaching that in the general population today. This will be a very 
43 
important message to convey to patients in order to understand the impact of a CML 
44 
diagnosis on their life. In addition, the increasing prevalence of CML patients will 
45 
have a great effect on future healthcare costs as long as continuous TKI treatment is 
46 
required.

Introduction 
49 
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by 
50 
an acquired balanced chromosomal translocation, giving rise to a constitutively active 
51 
tyrosine kinase (BCR–ABL1) 1. Untreated or symptomatically treated CML is a fatal 
52 
disease, with a reported median survival of approximately 2–3 years in seemingly 
53 
unselected CML populations 4. Over 90% of Swedish patients are diagnosed in the 
54 
chronic phase, and the major treatment goal is to prevent the disease from 
55 
progressing into more advanced phases 3. Treatment for CML patients has changed 
56 
dramatically over the years. CML therapy was restricted to busulphan and 
57 
hydroxyurea prior to the 1980s 4. During the 1980s allogeneic stem cell 
58 
transplantations (allo-SCT) and interferon-α were the treatments of choice.6. A 
59 
dramatic improvement occurred after 2000 due to the introduction of imatinib 
60 
mesylate (IM), the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specifically targeting the BCR–
61 
ABL1 oncoprotein 1. IM treatment significantly increased the survival and quality of 
62 
life for patients of all ages, particularly for patients in chronic phase 7,8.  
63 
The improved survival has led to an increasing prevalence, a trend that is projected 
64 
to continue during coming decades2,3,9. The increased prevalence in combination 
65 
with, for the large majority of patients, the recommended life-long IM treatment will 
66 
have a great impact on costs 9. It will be very important to, in an accessible way, 
67 
guide health care professionals, educators, and policy makers regarding present and 
68 
future achievements with a focus on population-based data. It is also important for 
69 
these groups, as well as for patients and clinicians, that survival statistics are 
70 
presented in a comprehendible way, that enhance the understanding of the impact of 
71 
a cancer diagnosis on a patient’s life expectancy, especially for chronic diseases 
72 
such as CML.  
73 
 5 
 
Life expectancy is a simple, well-known concept that quantifies the expected number 
74 
of life years remaining. The loss in expectation of life (LEL) is a survival measure that 
75 
presents the number of life years lost, or the reduction in the life expectancy, due to a 
76 
diagnosis of cancer 13,14. These measures have many advantages including being 
77 
easily comprehendible, and thus easily communicated, and providing a survival 
78 
measure over a whole time scale.  
79 
The aim of this study is to assess how the life expectancy of CML patients and life 
80 
years lost due to a diagnosis of CML have changed between 1973 and 2013 in 
81 
patients diagnosed in Sweden. Particular interest lies in the survival of patients after 
82 
the introduction of the TKIs. An additional aim is to determine whether improvements 
83 
previously reported in the survival of CML patients in Sweden have continued 
84 
between 2008 and 2013.

Methods 
86 
Cancer registries and patients 
87 
The study included CML patients recorded within the nationwide Swedish Cancer 
88 
Registry established in 1958. By law every incidence of cancer must be reported to 
89 
this registry by each physician and pathologist/cytologist. The Swedish Cancer 
90 
registry contains information on age, sex, date and type of diagnosis but does not 
91 
contain detailed information such as symptoms, routine laboratory tests, treatments 
92 
and comorbidities 15. Patients with CML were identified using International 
93 
Classification Version 8 (code 2051). All residents in Sweden are given a unique 
94 
national registration number which was used for linkage with the national Cause of 
95 
Death Register to obtain the date of death. 
96 
Patients who were diagnosed between January 1, 1973 and December 31, 2013 
97 
were included within the cohort. Patients were followed until their date of death, date 
98 
of emigration or to the end of follow-up (31 December 2013), whichever occurred 
99 
first. Diagnoses were included from 1973 since the registry is known to have reached 
100 
a high coverage for hematological malignancies by then 16. Only the first diagnosis of 
101 
CML of patients diagnosed at 50 years of age or above which were histologically 
102 
verified were considered. The reason for including patients aged 50 years and above 
103 
at diagnosis was so that long extrapolation was not required when calculating the 
104 
loss in expectation of life. Incidental autopsy findings and misclassified cases were 
105 
excluded. The study was approved by the Stockholm Regional Ethics Review Board. 
106 
Informed consent was waived since there was no contact with study participants. 
 
107

Statistical methods 
108 
The loss in expectation of life (LEL) is the difference between the life expectancy of a 
109 
cancer patient and the life expectancy of a similar individual, in terms of age and sex, 
110 
from the general population. This measure estimates the average number of life 
111 
years lost, or the reduction in the life expectancy, due to a diagnosis of cancer. The 
112 
LEL can also be presented as a proportion, in the form of the proportion of expected 
113 
life lost (PELL). This is the proportion of remaining life years that are lost due to a 
114 
diagnosis of cancer. The LEL and PELL can be estimated based on the relative 
115 
survival of the cancer patients and the survival of the general population 13. Relative 
116 
survival is defined as the all-cause observed survival in the cancer population under 
117 
study divided by the expected survival of a comparable group in the general 
118 
population 17,18. 
119 
The LEL and PELL were predicted from a flexible parametric relative survival model 
120 
with 5 degrees of freedom to model the baseline excess hazard 19,20. Age at 
121 
diagnosis, year of diagnosis and sex were all modeled (age and year continuously 
122 
using restricted cubic splines 21) and interactions between all these covariates were 
123 
included. The model included time-dependent effects with 2 degrees of freedom for 
124 
all covariates to allow for non-proportional excess hazards. The expected survival 
125 
was obtained from population mortality files up to 2012 and predictions beyond 2012 
126 
by Statistics Sweden 22 stratified on age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis and sex.  
127 
All analyses were performed in Stata 13 23.

Results 
130 
A total of 2,662 CML patients diagnosed between 1973 and 2013 at age 50 years 
131 
and over, 1,446 (54.3%) males and 1,216 (45.7%) females were included. The 
132 
median age at diagnosis for the included cohort was 69 years. See Table 1 for 
133 
descriptive statistics.  
134 
Results are presented for four selected ages at diagnosis; 55, 65, 75 and 85 years. 
135 
The life expectancy of the general population for males and females increased over 
136 
the follow-up period; this increase was larger for the younger populations presented.  
137 
The life expectancy of the CML patients steadily increased for all ages between 1973 
138 
and 1990. For younger CML patients presented in this study, a large increase in the 
139 
life expectancy was seen after 1990, this increase was not as great in the older 
140 
patients and began later, see Figure 1. The increase seen in the life expectancy in 
141 
those aged 55 at diagnosis after 1990 continued until 2013; however the largest 
142 
increase was seen between approximately 1990 and 2000, with a more steady 
143 
increase after 2000. In those CML patients aged 85 years at diagnosis the greatest 
144 
increase in life expectancy began from approximately 2000. The life expectancy of 
145 
CML patients of all ages increased dramatically over the whole of the study period 
146 
which resulted in the life expectancy of CML patients in 2013 was approaching that in 
147 
the general population. For example, a 55-year old male CML patient diagnosed in 
148 
1980 would on average have 3.5 (95% CI: 2.9, 4.1)  life years remaining whereas a 
149 
55-year old male diagnosed in 2010 would have 27.3 (95% CI: 25.7, 28.8) life years 
150 
remaining. An 85-year old male patient would on average have 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 1.1) 
151 
life years remaining if he was diagnosed in 1980 and 4.1 (95% CI: 3.4, 4.7) life years 
152 
remaining if he was diagnosed in 2010. The life expectancy of all aged CML patients 
153 
 9 
 
was within 3 years of the life expectancy in the general population for diagnoses in 
154 
2010, as shown in the LEL estimates; see Table 2 and Figure 2. 
155 
The LEL decreased for all ages over the study period but the most dramatic decrease 
156 
was seen in diagnoses after 1990 in younger patients presented. This was due to the 
157 
huge increase in the life expectancy of CML patients at this time; see Figure 2 and 
158 
Table 2. For example, a male diagnosed with CML in 1980 at age 55 on average had 
159 
a reduced life expectancy of 20.8 (95% CI: 20.2, 21.4). In contrast, a 55-year old 
160 
male diagnosed in 2010 would on average have a reduced life expectancy of only 2.6 
161 
(95% CI: 1.0, 4.1) years For older patients, improvements were still seen, with a more 
162 
rapid decrease after the 1990s, but not to the same scale as in the younger patients 
163 
since older patients have on average fewer potential remaining life years.  
164 
Estimates of PELL also suggest a vast improvement in the outcomes of CML patients 
165 
of all ages over the study period; see Figure 3 and Table 2.  Prior to approximately 
166 
1990, the PELL was higher in younger patients included in the study, whereas after 
167 
this time the PELL was higher in the older patients. For example, the PELL for a 55-
168 
year old male and an 85-year old male diagnosed in 1980 were 86% (95% CI: 83%, 
169 
88%) and 80% (95% CI: 76%, 85%) respectively, in 2010 these values were 9% 
170 
(95% CI: 4%, 14%) and 28% (95% CI: 16%, 40%) respectively.

 Discussion 
173 
Our results show that there has been a dramatic reduction in the life years lost in 
174 
patients diagnosed in Sweden with CML between 1973 and 2013. Patients aged 55 
175 
years at diagnosis benefitted greatly from 1990, and life expectancy improvements 
176 
continued to 2013 but less dramatically from 2000. For older patients, improvements 
177 
in life expectancy began a little later. The results indicate that the life expectancy of 
178 
CML patients is now close to the life expectancy of the general population for all 
179 
ages10-12. However, reports suggesting an increased incidence of other cancers 10,11 
180 
and cardiovascular morbidity 12 associated with the use of TKIs, could have a 
181 
negative impact on survival gains. Thus the life expectancy of CML patients may 
182 
never reach that seen in the general population. Also, approximately 10% of CML 
183 
patients diagnosed in Sweden are diagnosed in an advanced phase, and it is 
184 
therefore unlikely that the life expectancy for the whole group of CML patients will 
185 
reach the life expectancy of the whole population. Even so, the life expectancy of 
186 
CML patients was within 3 years of the life expectancy in the general population for 
187 
diagnoses in 2010, which must be seen as a great success of CML treatment. 
188 
Treatment for CML patients has changed dramatically over the years, and IM was 
189 
approved as CML treatment in Sweden in 2001 (second line) and 2002 (first line). 
190 
However, the implementation of imatinib differed between age groups: during the 
191 
period 2002–2008 it was on average 79% in persons below 70 years and 47% in 
192 
persons older than 70 years, leading to a less conspicuous or no improvement in 
193 
survival for elderly patients 2. These proportions increased to 94% for younger (<70 
194 
years) and 79% for older (>80 years) patients during 2007-2009 3. Although IM 
195 
remains the gold standard for first-line treatment of CML, the appearance of IM 
196 
resistance and intolerance has led to the development of several additional TKIs 24. 
197 
 11 
 
Studies have shown that second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) 
198 
improve outcome of CML patients in whom IM therapy has failed 24,25. In addition, a 
199 
third-generation TKI (ponatinib) targeting the frequently observed mutant T315I has 
200 
been developed 26. Thus, CML treatment is progressing rapidly and further 
201 
advancements are anticipated. Notwithstanding the fact that a small subgroup of 
202 
patients with an excellent response to treatment have been able to stop taking TKI 
203 
agents 27, most CML patients will take the drug for life which, along with the 
204 
increasing prevalence of CML, has high implications for the cost. Ohm et al. 
205 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of IM in CML patients and found that incremental 
206 
cost-effectiveness ratios comparing IM to other treatments were generally acceptable 
207 
by health authorities 9 meaning that these treatments should continue to be 
208 
financially feasible. 
209 
The results shown for the youngest patients presented here suggest that 
210 
improvements in survival of CML patients began for patients diagnosed in the mid-
211 
1990s. Our results also show improvements from the introduction of IM in 2001, 
212 
however, great improvements are observed prior to its introduction. The 
213 
improvements seen for older patients began slightly later than the younger patients 
214 
presented; however there was no immediate improvement after 2001 when IM was 
215 
introduced. The use of interferon-α28, more precise diagnostics involving centralised 
216 
cytogeneic labs and a more structured approach in treating and monitoring CML 
217 
patients are plausible explanations for the trend.. Although our research suggests 
218 
that improvements in survival of CML patients over the years may not have been 
219 
completely due to the introduction of IM, it is clear that the prognosis for CML patients 
220 
today is extremely positive with the current treatment.  
221 
 12 
 
Sasaki et al. concluded from clinical trial data that the five-year survival of chronic-
222 
CML patients was almost the same as the general population29; our results support 
223 
this finding. Björkholm et al. followed Swedish CML patients on a population level and 
224 
saw improvements in the relative survival between 1973 and 2008 for Swedish CML 
225 
patients of all ages, with vast improvements in those aged 79 years and less at 
226 
diagnosis from 2001 2. Our study shows that these improvements have continued to 
227 
2013. We here chose to present outcomes in CML patients using LEL whilst others 
228 
quantified survival using relative survival. It is important to remember that these two 
229 
measures are related but describe different aspects of the patients’ survival. In 
230 
particular, the relative survival is an estimate of net survival which is interpreted in a 
231 
hypothetical situation where cancer patients can only die of their cancer whereas the 
232 
loss in expectation of life is a measure which represents the real-world survival seen 
233 
by cancer patients.  
234 
One potential limitation of the study is that the current analysis is not able to capture 
235 
any late lethal effects if they were to occur, due to fewer years of follow-up in the later 
236 
calendar years; the fewer years of follow-up also mean that the estimates presented 
237 
rely more on the model assumptions. However, it is also possible that any late 
238 
adverse effects may not impact the life span of patients.  
239 
A major strength of the current study is the use of population-based information; we 
240 
include all CML diagnoses reported to the Swedish Cancer Register between 1973 
241 
and 2013. The Swedish Cancer Register has high completeness; in 1998 it was 
242 
estimated to capture 96% of all cancers in Sweden 16. Using population-based data is 
243 
optimal since it captures the mortality of CML patients in Sweden on a whole whilst 
244 
incorporating changes in treatments, increasing prevalence of CML and potential 
245 
negative side-effects of treatments for CML patients. Unfortunately, the Swedish 
246 
 13 
 
Cancer Register doesn’t contain information on treatment and other detailed clinical 
247 
information. This also means that there is a lack of potential confounder information 
248 
such as socioeconomic status. 
249 
In order to present the LEL for all patients including those diagnosed in the most 
250 
recent years, extrapolation from models are required. This potential weakness of the 
251 
LEL has been assessed by Andersson et al.13 in several different cancers and 
252 
extrapolation was shown to be accurate. However, further extrapolation is required to 
253 
calculate the LEL in younger patients due to their larger potential life expectancy. 
254 
Therefore, the LEL was presented for patients aged 55 years and above.  
255 
In conclusion, the life expectancy, and the number of life years lost, has vastly 
256 
improved in all-aged CML patients in Sweden since 1973 with larger improvements 
257 
beginning already in the mid-1990s. IM along allo-SCT and other factors have 
258 
contributed to the life expectancy in CML patients being almost the same as the 
259 
general population today.
