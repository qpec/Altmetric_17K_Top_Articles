 Revisiting the “Christmas Holiday Effect” in the Southern Hemisphere

Background-—A “Christmas holiday effect” showing elevated cardiovascular mortality over the Christmas holidays (December
25 to January 7) was demonstrated previously in study from the United States. To separate the effect of seasonality from any
holiday effect, a matching analysis was conducted for New Zealand, where the Christmas holiday period falls within the
summer season.
Methods and Results-—New Zealand mortality data for a 25-year period (1988–2013) was analyzed based on the same
methodology used in the previous study. Locally weighted smoothing was used to calculate an “expected” number of deaths
for each day of the year. The expected value was compared with the actual number of deaths. In addition, mean age at death
was estimated and used to assess the life-years lost due to excess mortality. There were 738 409 deaths (197 109 coded as
cardiac deaths) during the period. We found evidence of a Christmas holiday effect in our of medical facility’s cardiac deaths,
with an excess event rate of 4.2% (95% CI 0.7–7.7%) leading to �4 additional deaths per annum. The average age of those
with fatal cardiac deaths was 76.8 years (SD 13.5) during the Christmas holiday period, resulting in 148 to 222 years of life
lost per annum.
Conclusions-—Cardiac mortality is elevated during the Christmas holiday period relative to surrounding time periods. Our findings
are consistent with a previously reported study conducted in the United States, suggesting that cardiac mortality does not take a
“summer break.” (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e005098 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.005098)

A
“Christmas holiday effect” on mortality has been
established in the United States, with spikes in deaths
from natural causes at both Christmas and New Year’s Day.1
In the United States, however, the Christmas holiday period
coincides with the coldest period of the year, when mortality
rates are already seasonally high because of low temperatures
and influenza.2 Previous studies used statistical techniques to
help disentangle the holiday effect from the winter effect and
found that deaths from natural causes were almost 5% higher
than would be expected if the holidays did not affect
mortality.1
Various possible explanations exist for a mortality holiday
effect, including the emotional stress associated with the
holidays, changes in diet and alcohol consumption,3 less staff
at medical facilities, and changes in the physical environment
(eg, visiting relatives). Nevertheless, few attempts have been
made to replicate this study. A regional analysis conducted in
the north of England failed to find any elevated mortality at
Christmas but found a spike on New Year’s Day.4 Although
the original study indicated1 that future research should “seek
to disaggregate the effects of winter and the winter holiday,”
we are unaware any comparable studies conducted in the
Southern Hemisphere, where Christmas occurs during sum-
mer, when death rates are usually at a seasonal low. In this
paper, we have replicated the earlier Northern Hemisphere
analysis using data from New Zealand, which allows us to
separate any winter effect from the holiday effect.

 Health. Access to the mortality collection data was permitted
via an addendum to the data access agreement between the
VIEW/PREDICT project5 and the New Zealand Ministry of
Health. The deaths were categorized into cardiac and noncar-
diac groups, as defined by Phillips et al,1 on the basis of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code assigned as
the primary cause of death for that person. Specifically, ICD-9
codes 390–398, 402, 404, and 410–429 and ICD-10 codes
I00–I09, I11, I13, and I20–I51 were considered cardiac events.
To allow for further decomposition of the data, the events were
further categorized as to whether or not the death occurred in a
medical facility. This was determined at the time of mortality
coding using the location of death recorded on the death
certificate. Where the recorded location of death was not a
recognized medical facility, the code 9990 was recorded,
indicating that the person had died outside of a medical facility.6
Deaths on the additional day in leap years (February 29) were
removed. This meant all days in the calendar year were
identically coded. To prevent any disclosure of confidential
information, only data at the aggregated level were reported.
This aggregation included national-level reporting and the use
of pooled ICD codes, as specified, rather than ICD codes for
specific conditions.
Mortality records are centrally coded by the New Zealand
Ministry of Health on the basis of death certificates completed
by individual certifying physicians. The centralization of the
coding is expected to reduce variability that might otherwise
occur if the coding were undertaken at a facility or regional
level. The possibility of misclassification remains during coding
of the cause of death but is unlikely to be specific to the
Christmas period because the coding is not done strictly
contemporaneously. A World Health Organization report clas-
sified New Zealand as a “low ill-defined coding” country for the
coding of ischemic heart disease deaths, giving confidence that
the mortality data are robust and accurate.7
All unique identifiers for data used in the analysis were
encrypted, and the PREDICT study was approved by the
Northern Region Ethics Committee Y in 2003 (AKY/03/12/
314), with subsequent annual approval by the National
Multiregion Ethics Committee since 2007 (MEC07/19/EXP).
We followed a previously published analysis1 in using a
polynomial regression locally weighted smoothing (LOESS)
function for daily mortality data. The bandwidth used for the
LOESS was 0.11 based on the description from Phillips and
colleagues of 6-week bandwidth within an annual cycle, giving
the following calculation: (697)/365.25. As explained by
Phillips and colleagues, this method corrects for trends and
seasonality but makes minimal distributional assumptions
about the data. This method calculates an expected number
of deaths that was compared with the actual number of
deaths to detect short-term fluctuations from an expected
seasonal pattern such as a Christmas holiday effect.
The Christmas holiday period was defined as December 25
to January 7. To minimize the established impact of season-
ality on mortality, the 2 weeks before (December 11–24) and
after (January 8–21) the Christmas period were used as
comparison periods in addition to an “all non-Christmas” time
period. The all non-Christmas period was defined as all dates
not between December 25 and January 7 and so includes the
pre- and post-Christmas windows.
An excess event percentage was calculated based on the
difference in number of events between the actual and
expected values for each day of the year, for which the
expected value was defined by the LOESS data using the
following formula: ((actual�expected)/expected)9100. To
get a summary estimate for the impact of the Christmas
holiday period on excess mortality, the mean value for all
excess event percentages within the time periods (14 days
for the pre-Christmas, Christmas, and post-Christmas values
and the 351 days of the all non-Christmas period) were
calculated.
Mean ages at death and standard deviations were
calculated for all mortality, all cardiac mortality, and cardiac
mortality outside of a medical facility for the 4 time periods
identified. To compare the age distributions of the mortality
data, a t test was conducted and Cohen’s d was calculated.
Cohen’s d is a measure of the size of the difference between 2
values for continuous data.8 It is often used in cases for which
a very large sample size means that a t test will typically result
in a statistically significant P value; however, this P value
provides no information about the practical significance of the
difference between the results.
To observe the impact across the age range, a cumulative
distribution plot was created. An estimate of decreased life-
years was calculated on the basis of the difference in mean
age at death for the Christmas period and the comparison
time period, either the pre-Christmas or all non-Christmas
period, multiplied by the number of events within the
Christmas period. This value was then compared with census
data to calculate an effect per million persons for the most
recent time period, with the denominator provided by the
2013 New Zealand census population9 estimated as the
“usually resident population.” The usually resident population
figure was used to avoid issues with undercounting found in
the raw census count figures.
As a sensitivity analysis, the Christmas holiday period was
moved incrementally forward and backward from the baseline
Christmas start date of December 25 to test for any
boundaries of the holiday effect. To maintain comparability
between results, the 2-week time period was maintained by
moving the end date in an identical manner as the start date.
Because
the LOESS method partially
incorporates any
Christmas effect in the smoothing algorithm, a sensitivity
analysis was undertaken to estimate the size of this impact.

 This was done by calculating an expected value for each day
of the Christmas period by linear interpolation using the last
day of the pre-Christmas period and the first day of the post-
Christmas period.
To detect any broad-scale change in magnitude in the size
of any Christmas effect, the 26 years of data were divided in
to 4 approximately equal time periods, and subgroup analysis
was undertaken, as described.
Results
There were 738 409 deaths (of which 197 109 where
coded as cardiac deaths) in New Zealand between 1988
and 2013 (Figure 1). The average age of cardiac mortality
was 76.2 years (SD 13.7) during the Christmas period
compared with 77.1 years (SD 13.2) at other times of the
year (Table 1). Comparing the Christmas period with the 2
weeks immediately prior to Christmas indicated that the
average age of cardiac death was �6 months less (76.2
years
[SD
13.7]
versus
76.8
years
[13.5],

(Table 1).
The mortality data had an observable Christmas holiday
effect for those persons who died out of hospital from an
event for which the principal code was a cardiac-related
diagnosis (Figure 2). Each point on Figure 2 represents the
mean number of events by calendar date based on the
26 years of available records. The chart was centered on the
Christmas period to make observations of the critical time
period easier. There were 4.2% (95% CI 0.7–7.7%) more
recorded events than would be expected based on the annual
trends absent a Christmas effect (Table 2). There was no
significant change from the seasonal trend for cardiac death
within a medical facility (�0.7%, 95% CI �4.2% to 2.8%) or for
overall mortality.
During the 2012–2013 Christmas season, the latest for
which we have full data, there were 247 cardiac deaths of
which 93 were outside of a hospital facility. We estimated �4
additional cardiac-related deaths out of hospital due to the
Christmas holiday effect. Statistics New Zealand reported the
population as 4 442 100 based on the 2013 New Zealand
census.9 This indicates an increased event rate of �0.9 death
per million people within the 2 weeks of the Christmas period.
Based on the decreased mean age of death, between 148 and
222 life-years (based on the pre-Christmas and full-year
estimates, respectively) were lost due to the Christmas
holiday effect.
The size of the effect was sensitive to the timing of the
start of the holiday period (Figures S1 and S2), with the effect
peaking in the 2 weeks starting December 27, for which a
4.5% (95% CI 1.1–7.9%) excess event rate was detected
(Table S1). When the start date for a modified Christmas
period was on or before December 23, there was no

 statistically significant Christmas effect. Likewise, if the start
date was moved to or beyond December 29, no holiday effect
was detected, placing upper and lower bounds on the timing
of the Christmas effect. When the a linear interpolation was
used to derive the expected values for the Christmas period,
an increase in the effect was observed, suggesting that the
LOESS method potentially underestimated the size of the
effect by �0.8% (Figure S3, Table S2).
When a subgroup analysis of the magnitude of the
Christmas holiday effect was undertaken, there was no
statistically significant difference in the size of the effect
between the earlier and later time periods (Figure S4). There
was a nonsignificant trend toward an increasing Christmas
holiday effect in the later time periods, suggesting against any
attenuation of the size of the Christmas effect (Table S3).
Discussion
We found that 4.2% more persons die from a cardiac-related
cause outside of a hospital during the Christmas period than
would be expected based on long-term seasonal trends. This
is consistent with reports from the United States that also
indicated an increased mortality rate during the Christmas
holiday period in the Northern Hemisphere. Because the
seasonality, and associated temperature profile, is opposite to
the previously reported results from the Northern Hemi-
sphere, this result supports the conclusions of Phillips and
colleagues1 and, prior to that, Kloner et al,3 who indicated
that the Christmas holiday effect is not associated with
temperature, specifically with the cold temperatures associ-
ated with winter.
Persons who die from a cardiac event, in or out of hospital,
during the Christmas period are younger by almost a year
than those who die from the same or similar condition during
the remainder of the year. The decrease in age at death is
reduced but is still present when the comparison periods are
restricted to the Christmas period and the 2 weeks prior, for
which it was found that those who had a fatal cardiac event
during the Christmas period were �6 months younger than
those who died during the previous 2 weeks.
Phillips and colleagues1 suggested 8 further potential
explanations, some of which can potentially be clarified using
the New Zealand data; others remain ambiguous.
Causes for the Christmas holiday effect that are unlikely
considering the New Zealand data include:
1 Respiratory diseases: Given that Christmas falls in the
summer season within the Southern Hemisphere, respira-
tory illness seems to be an unlikely contributor to the

 increased mortality rate. Respiratory disease rates show a
strong correlation with the winter season in New Zealand10
and other Southern Hemisphere countries11 and so are
unlikely to play a major role in any Christmas holiday effect
in New Zealand.
2 Increased particulate pollution: Phillips and colleagues1
conjectured that the increased particulate matter during
their winter season might be a cause of the increased
cardiac mortality rate. Pollution levels peak in many parts
of the world in winter because of increased heating, which
is not a factor in the New Zealand summer.12,13
3 Reporting effect: The Christmas holiday effect has now
been described in at least 3 different regions,1,4 including
New Zealand. This would argue against a reporting effect
being a major contributor to any apparent Christmas
holiday effect. It would require an assumption that a
common or comparable issue was present in all reporting
and recording systems represented, which, although not
impossible, is considered unlikely.
4 Month-boundary effect: The Christmas holiday effect is not
correlated with a monthly reporting cycle. It has also has
been observed in a number of independent jurisdictions,
reducing the likelihood of a month-boundary effect.
Other suggested explanations are not clarified by the new
results:
1 Changes in diet and alcohol consumption: The contribution
of this factor cannot be further elaborated because it is a
function of the holiday period and not of seasonality.
Furthermore, the degree of overlap between the general
holiday traditions and timing of events between New
Zealand and the United States makes any distinction
difficult without high-quality dietary data. Assessing the
impact of major holidays on cardiac mortality in cultures
that have cultural attributes, including major holidays,
distinct from New Zealand and Australia culture may aid in
clarification of any dietary component.
2 Emotional stress associated with holidays: The contribution
of this factor cannot be further elaborated because this is a
function of the holiday and not of seasonality.
3 Inappropriate delay in seeking medical care: The Christmas
holiday period is a common time for travel within New
Zealand, with people frequently traveling away from the
main centers. This could contribute to delays in seeking
treatment because of both a lack of familiarity with nearby
medical facilities and geographic isolation from appropriate
medical care in emergency situations. The reduced age at
death (Table 1) recorded during the Christmas period for
persons with cardiac-related mortality compared with both
the non-Christmas and pre-Christmas periods (�1 year
and 6 months less, respectively) could add weight to the
argument that this item is indeed a factor.
4 Displacement of death: This would include both hastening
and postponement of death for reasons associated with
the holiday period. The ability of persons to modify their
date of death on the basis of dates of significance has been
both confirmed14,15 and refuted16,17 elsewhere; however, it
remains a possible explanation for this holiday effect.
Because the Christmas effect is seen in cardiac deaths,
this limits or eliminates the involvement of suicides, in
which the time of death is much more directly controlled by
the individual than other modes of mortality. The hastening
or delaying of mortality would be expected to create a
displacement effect in which a local peak is developed on
or around dates of significance, leading to decreases in
events surrounding the period in a compensatory manner.
The 2 explanations that are most supported by the data
are displacement of death and inappropriate delay in seeking
medical care. The modification of the age at death would
appear to suggest that access to medical treatment, which

 would otherwise preserve life, is not available during this
period. With regard to displacement of death, the trend
within the data is toward concentration of cardiac mortality
during the Christmas period, with lower than expected
results (but not statistically significant) before and after
Christmas.
Although the methods presented closely replicate those
used in prior publications, some limitations of this current
study could be addressed in future work. Ideally, daily
temperature would have been linked to mortality events;
however, this was not possible with this data set at this stage.
This is a limitation, but a recent report indicated that the
majority of mortality attributable to temperature was caused
by cold conditions, with excessive heat playing a reduced
role.2 This should mitigate the impact of not directly
accounting for temperature variation in this data set, because
the observed Christmas effect occurs during the summer
season. New Zealand also has a temperate, island climate,
which almost eliminates the extremes of temperature18 that
have been associated with increased cardiovascular disease
mortality rates.19,20 The historical temperature records also
indicate that the hottest period of the year in New Zealand
typically falls outside of the identified Christmas periods.21
Because of the LOESS method used to estimate the
“usual” event rate, it is likely that the effect of the Christmas
period is underestimated due to the smoothing procedure
incorporating part of the Christmas holiday effect into the
estimate of expected events. This can be observed in
Figure 2, in which a prominent deviation upward during the
Christmas period can be observed on the smoothing or
expected line (black line). The partial incorporation of the
increase associated with the Christmas holiday effect would
be expected to bias the result toward the null result of “no
Christmas effect,” making it less likely to detect any true
Christmas effect. A sensitivity analysis conducted to test this
assumption indicated that the underestimate is on the order
of 0.8%, or �20% of the detected effect. The result thus
represents a conservative estimate, and there is confidence
that, on the basis of the data available, the Christmas effect
seen in the New Zealand population is of at least the
magnitude reported. On this basis, and to maximize compa-
rability with the paper by Philips et al,1 we maintained the
LOESS method for this analysis.
In conclusion, we observed a clear Christmas holiday effect
in the New Zealand population for persons suffering a cardiac
death outside of a hospital setting, replicating the effect
observed in US data. This result in the Southern Hemisphere,
with seasonality opposite that in previous reports, helps
reaffirm that there is no apparent correlation between any
observed Christmas holiday effect and the impact of temper-
ature or seasonality. We found that the age of death was
younger for those who died from a cardiac-related condition
during the Christmas period compared with those who died of
a similar condition during the remainder of the year and in the
pre-Christmas period. By virtue of studying data from a
Southern Hemisphere location, we have been able to clarify
the likely causes contributing to the Christmas holiday effect;
however, we are not able to make a definitive statement about
the cause of the effect. There is the possibility of a
displacement effect, in which mortality is being concentrated
during the holiday period rather than directly causing
additional mortality; however, the use of a different method
of estimating the expected deaths will be required to fully
explore this issue.
