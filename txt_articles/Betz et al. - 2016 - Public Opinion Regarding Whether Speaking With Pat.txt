 Public Opinion Regarding Whether Speaking With Patients About
Firearms Is Appropriate
Results of a National Survey
Marian E. Betz, MD, MPH; Deborah Azrael, PhD; Catherine Barber, MPA; and Matthew Miller, MD, ScD
Background: Health care providers have been encouraged to
discuss firearms with patients; whether patients view these dis-
cussions as appropriate is unclear.
Objective: To estimate, in a national sample, the perceived ap-
propriateness of provider discussions about firearms.
Design: Probability-based online survey conducted in April
2015. Analyses used survey weights to generate nationally rep-
resentative estimates.
Setting: U.S. adults.
Participants: 3914 English-speaking adults (55% participation
rate).
Measurements: Participants were asked, “In general, would
you think it is never, sometimes, usually, or always appropriate
for physicians and other health professionals to talk to their pa-
tients about firearms?”
Results: A majority (66% [95% CI, 63% to 69%]) of participants
said that it is at least sometimes appropriate for providers to talk
to patients about firearms. Specifically, 23% (CI, 20% to 25%)
said that provider discussions about firearms were always appro-
priate, 14% (CI, 11% to 16%) said that they were usually appro-
priate, and 30% (CI, 27% to 33%) thought they were sometimes
appropriate; 34% (CI, 31% to 37%) felt that such discussions
were never appropriate. Views varied by firearm ownership: 54%
(CI, 52% to 57%) of gun owners said that provider discussions
are at least sometimes appropriate, compared with 67% (CI, 62%
to 71%) of nonowners living with an owner and 70% (CI, 66% to
74%) of nonowners not living with an owner. Firearm owners
who were more likely to think that firearm discussions are at least
sometimes appropriate included those with children at home
(62% [CI, 57% to 67%]), those who thought that having a gun at
home increases suicide risk (75% [CI, 67% to 83%), and those
who thought that provider discussions of seat belts are at least
sometimes appropriate (73% [CI, 70% to 75%]).
Limitations: The provider discussion question did not specify
clinical context.
Conclusion: Two thirds of non–firearm owners and over one
half of firearm owners in the United States believe that health
care provider discussions about firearms are at least sometimes
appropriate. The observed heterogeneity underscores the need
to better understand assumptions that may underlie these views,
particularly among firearm owners.

I
n 2014 in the United States, there were 33 599 fire-
arm deaths and an additional estimated 81 000 non-
fatal firearm injuries (1). Suicides account for the major-
ity (59%) of firearm deaths (1). Unintentional deaths and
injuries in children from home firearms, although far
fewer in number, are another area of concern given
their preventability. Many pediatric shootings could be
prevented through safe firearm storage (2) or by not
having firearms in homes with children (as recom-
mended by the American Academy of Pediatrics) (3).
Storing firearms locked and unloaded has been associ-
ated with lower risk for completed suicide among chil-
dren (2) and adults (4, 5). For those at risk for suicide,
storing household firearms either away from home or
securely at home (that is, locked inaccessibly to at-risk
people until they have recovered) is a suicide preven-
tion approach that is considered an indispensable part
of best practice (6–8) and is advocated as such by na-
tional organizations (9, 10).
Prior surveys have found that many gun owners
store at least some guns unlocked and loaded; storage
practices varying by type of gun owned, the reason for
ownership, the presence of children in the home, and
geographic location (11–14). For example, Okoro and
colleagues (15) estimated that 1.69 million children
younger than 18 years (95% CI, 1.57 to 1.82 million)
were living in homes with at least 1 loaded and un-
locked firearm in 2002 (15). Recognizing that education
from health care providers may help reduce unsafe
storage practices (16–19), many medical and public
health organizations have advocated firearm safety
counseling by health care providers (20), especially
when there are children or teens at home or when a
patient is at risk for harm to self or others.
However, health care providers do not seem to
routinely discuss firearms with patients, even when the
providers believe that such discussions are important
(16, 21). This discrepancy probably stems from such
issues as limited provider training, time constraints, and
concerns about whether patients would be likely to fol-
low a health professional'
s suggestions (16). National
firearm organizations provide guidance for firearm
owners about safe home storage, including recommen-
dations about locked storage (22, 23). However, some
groups oppose clinicians discussing firearms with pa-
tients and have supported legislation to limit question-

 ing and documentation about firearms (24, 25). These
legislative initiatives, which are still being debated in
the courts and the public realm (24, 26), may heighten
providers' concern about the legality of discussions
about firearms. The initiatives may also exacerbate or
engender fear among providers about alienating or of-
fending patients (27, 28), even though prior work with
convenience samples suggests that most patients are
not offended by “culturally competent” education (27–
33) that incorporates preferred terminology (34) and
respects the autonomy and values of firearm owners.
To date, studies examining patient views on the ap-
propriateness of firearm discussions have focused on
subpopulations (for example, patients in a family prac-
tice clinic) (16). Our study is the first of which we are
aware to use a nationally representative sample of
adults to describe the perceived appropriateness of
firearm discussions between health care providers and
patients.
METHODS
Design and Sampling
Data came from a nationally representative, Web-
based survey conducted in April 2015. We designed
the survey and contracted the survey firm GfK to admin-
ister it. Respondents were drawn from GfK'
s Knowl-
edgePanel, a sampling frame that includes approxi-
mately 55 000 U.S. adults and is selected on an
ongoing basis with a design based on equal probability
of selection (35). Invitations to participate were sent by
e-mail; 1 reminder e-mail was sent to nonresponders 3
days later. Additional details are available in the Ap-
pendix (available at www.annals.org). Participants did
not receive any specific incentive to complete this sur-
vey, although GfK has a modest point-based incentive
program through which participants accrue points for
completing surveys and can later redeem them for
cash, merchandise, or participation in sweepstakes.
The Northeastern University Institutional Review
Board approved the study.
Measures
The full survey was designed primarily to describe
gun ownership, storage, and use patterns in the United
States; detailed findings about these domains are pub-
lished elsewhere (36). Our primary outcome measure
was survey respondents'answers to a single question
on health care provider discussions about guns: “In
general, would you think it is never, sometimes, usually,
or always appropriate for physicians and other health
professionals to talk to their patients about firearms?”
Three related items asked whether it was never, some-
times, usually, or always appropriate for providers to
talk to their patients about alcohol, seat belts, and
cigarettes.
In addition to demographic information, the survey
assessed other factors that might be related to our out-
come of interest; these included firearm ownership,
storage, use, presence of children in the home, political
views, presence of firearms in the home during child-
hood, prior firearm safety training, and opinions about
various firearm-related issues. Firearm ownership status
was assessed and classified into 3 a priori groups: non–
gun owner, does not live with a gun owner; nonowner,
lives with an owner; or personally owns a firearm. Fire-
arm owners were asked additional questions about typ-
ical storage practices. Key survey questions are avail-
able in the Supplement (available at www.annals.org).
Weighting and Analysis
To ensure reliable estimates at the national level,
our survey oversampled gun owners and veterans. GfK
provided final survey weights that combined pre-
sample weights with study-specific poststratification
weights to account for both this oversampling and for
survey nonresponse. Additional details about weight-
ing are available in the Appendix.
We conducted all analyses by using Stata IC 11
(StataCorp), with use of appropriate weighting com-
mands (using the weight variable provide by GfK) to
generate national estimates and following the STROBE
(Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology) guidelines for reporting (37). We de-
scribed participants' demographic characteristics and
perspectives by using weighted percentages and 95%
CIs. For ease of exposition and presentation, for some
analyses we collapsed our 4-category primary outcome
(never, sometimes, usually, always) into a dichotomous
variable (never vs. at least sometimes).
Role of the Funding Source
This work was supported by the Fund for a Safer
Future and the Joyce Foundation. Neither funder
played a role in the design, conduct, or reporting of the
research, or in the decision to submit the manuscript
for publication.
RESULTS
Of 7318 invited panel members, 4165 started and
3949 completed the survey (overall response rate,
54.6%, excluding 48 active-duty military personnel who
started the survey but were ineligible to complete it).
Compared with survey nonrespondents, respondents
were more likely to be female, younger, less educated,
unmarried, and living in metropolitan areas. Respon-
dents were approximately as likely as nonrespondents
to live in a home with a firearm, but they were more
likely to personally own a firearm.
We excluded 35 respondents with missing re-
sponses to the question about the appropriateness of
physicians discussing firearms with patients, resulting in
a final sample size of 3914. Over one half of these 35
persons also did not answer the related questions
about discussing seat belts, tobacco, or alcohol but re-
ported similar rates of firearm ownership.
Participant Characteristics
Among respondents, approximately one half were
men, the mean age was 49 years, and 30% (CI, 27% to
33%) had at least 1 child (aged <18 years) living in their
household (Table 1). Nearly one half reported having a
firearm in their home during childhood (48% [CI, 45%

 to 51%]), and 24% (CI, 22% to 26%) said they had per-
sonally had formal firearm safety training. Twenty-six
percent (CI, 24% to 28%) of respondents said that a
firearm makes a home safer, 24% (CI, 21% to 27%) said
it makes it more dangerous, and the remainder said it
depends.
Thirty-five percent of respondents reported that
they or someone else in the household owned 1 or
more guns; among these, 63% (CI, 60% to 65%) re-
ported that they themselves were a gun owner (Table
1). Almost all gun owners (95% [CI, 94% to 96%]) said
that at least 1 gun was stored in or around their home.
Participant Attitudes
Regarding discussions by health care professionals
with patients, 66% (CI, 63% to 69%) of all respondents
said that it is at least sometimes appropriate for provid-
ers to talk to patients about firearms—a lower propor-
tion than reported that it is at least sometimes appro-
priate for providers to talk with patients about seat
belts (81% [CI, 80% to 84%]), tobacco (95% [CI, 93% to
97%]), or alcohol (96% [CI, 94% to 97%]) (Figure and
Appendix Table, available at www.annals.org). Twenty-
three percent (CI, 20% to 25%) of respondents thought
that provider discussions about firearms were always
appropriate, 14% (CI, 11% to 16%) thought they were
usually appropriate, 30% (CI, 27% to 33%) sometimes
appropriate, and 34% (CI, 31% to 37%) never appropri-
ate. Among respondents who thought that discussions
about firearms were at least sometimes appropriate,
95% (CI, 93% to 96%) also thought that discussions
about seat belts, tobacco, and alcohol were at least
sometimes appropriate.

ateness of firearm discussions, by participant character-

Among gun owners, 54% (CI, 52% to 57%) said that
firearm discussions are at least sometimes appropriate,
compared with 67% (CI, 62% to 71%) of nonowners

52% (CI, 49% to 55%) of those without a child at home
viewed discussions as at least sometimes appropriate.
Firearm owners who indicated conservative political af-
filiations and those who reported believing a home fire-
arm makes the home safer less often felt that provider
discussions were ever appropriate (Table 2). Gun own-

 cide (83% [CI, 77% to 91%]) or makes the home more
dangerous (81% [CI, 74% to 87%]), or when they be-
lieved that provider discussions about seat belts are at
least sometimes appropriate (73% [CI, 70% to 75%]).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative survey of adults in
the United States, 2 out of 3 adults (66%) said that it is
at least sometimes appropriate for health care provid-
ers to discuss firearms with their patients. However,
views varied by demographic characteristics, including
firearm ownership status; by views on the risks of
household firearms with respect to suicide and more
generally; and by views on whether providers should
discuss other preventive health issues.
Our findings underscore the variability in patient
views. Indeed, those who believed that provider discus-
sions about seat belts are at least sometimes appropri-
ate most often reported similar views regarding the ap-
propriateness of discussions about firearms. Use of
in-vehicle restraints clearly decreases the likelihood of
death during a car crash (38, 39), although the incre-
mental effectiveness of physician counseling in increas-
ing the proportion of their patients who use seat belts is
unclear (40). Similarly, safe firearm storage is associ-
ated with lower risk for firearm death (2, 4, 5), although
more work is needed to identify the most effective way
to promote safer storage practices (16). For the practic-
ing clinician, this means that some patients may be un-
interested in or resistant to discussing firearm safety in
a clinical setting, at least initially. Finding ways to rou-
tinize these discussions or, more generally, to optimize
approaches to addressing firearm safety may help cli-
nicians and their patients navigate these conversations
in the clinical setting in ways that lead to more informed
decision making.
Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the pop-
ulation with firearms at home, and the varied response
they may have to injury prevention counseling or inter-
ventions. Among people living in homes with firearms,
nonowners seemed to be more open to counseling
than the owners themselves, although nonowners
might not be fully aware of storage practices (41) and
might be less likely to control decision making regard-
ing gun storage (12). A particularly notable finding was
that firearm owners with a child at home and partici-
pants who viewed home firearms as a risk factor for
suicide more often said that firearm discussions are at
least sometimes appropriate, suggesting that discus-
sions may be best received when they are clearly rele-
vant to the clinical context (for example, anticipatory
guidance for pediatric injury prevention or reducing
the risk for self-harm for someone with suicide risk).
Our study has limitations. First, the provider ques-
tion did not specify the context in which such discus-
sions might take place, and perceived appropriateness
may vary according to clinical indication (for example,
risk for suicide or having a child in the home) (29). As

 one example, in a focus group study, veterans who had
received treatment for a mental health problem found
it acceptable for clinicians to raise the topic of firearm
access (33). Second, other factors that might affect
views of provider discussions of firearms were not as-
sessed in this survey but deserve attention in future
work. These might include employment in the medical
or public health community, living with or being some-
one at increased risk for suicide or harm to others, per-
sonal losses to firearm violence, prior positive or nega-
tive experiences with provider counseling, physician
specialty, and established relationship with the pro-
vider. Third, support for provider discussions about
firearms in our study may have been elevated because
of social desirability bias, but online surveys in general
are less subject to such biases than are other forms of
eliciting opinions (42). Finally, our survey completion
rate (55%) was higher than those of typical nonprob-
ability, opt-in, online surveys, which have completion
rates of 2% to 16% (43), and it was higher than those of
a previous national injury survey that included ques-
tions about firearm ownership (48%) (44).
To our knowledge, our study provides the first na-
tional estimates among adults in the United States of
the acceptability of health care provider discussions
about firearms. Most respondents thought that such
discussions are at least sometimes appropriate. The
observed heterogeneity in opinions highlights the
need for communications research to better under-
stand the viewpoints of all types of firearm owners
when creating targeted firearm safety educational ma-
terials and interventions; the assumptions that may un-
derlie these views; and what information may help
open up the possibility of dialogue for different people,
especially in higher-risk situations, such as when a pa-
tient is experiencing a mental health problem. It is im-
portant that any messaging about firearm safety be fac-
tually accurate and represented in a way that neither
overstates risks nor alienates patients. Partnerships with
stakeholders who are knowledgeable about firearm
safety (45)—as well as involvement by both gun-owning
and non–gun-owning providers—offer potential to ad-
vance foundational knowledge about the observed
heterogeneity in views and to improve the content,
acceptability,
and
effectiveness
of
firearm
safety
counseling.

APPENDIX: DETAILED SURVEY METHODS
Study Design
The GfK Group (formerly Knowledge Networks;
www.gfk.com) was contracted by Northeastern Univer-
sity (principal investigator, M. Miller) to conduct the Na-
tional Firearms Survey, which aimed to examine firearm
ownership and use in the United States. The survey was
conducted in a sample from KnowledgePanel, an on-
line research panel that is representative of the entire
U.S. population.
KnowledgePanel Details
Panel members are randomly recruited through
probability-based sampling, and households are pro-
vided with access to the Internet and hardware if
needed. GfK recruits panel members by using address-
based sampling methods (previously, GfK relied on
random-digit dialing methods). After initially accepting
the invitation to join the panel, participants are asked to
complete a short demographic survey (the initial profile
survey), answers to which allow efficient panel sampling
and weighting for future surveys. Completion of the
profile survey allows participants to become panel
members, and as in the past, all respondents are
provided the same privacy terms and confidentiality
protections.
Once household members are recruited for the
panel and assigned to a study sample, they are notified
by e-mail for survey taking, or panelists can visit their
online member page for survey-taking (instead of be-
ing contacted by telephone or postal mail). This ap-
proach reduces the burden placed on respondents,
because e-mail notification is less intrusive than tele-
phone calls, and most respondents find answering
Web questionnaires more interesting and engaging
than being questioned by a telephone interviewer. Fur-
thermore,
respondents
have
the
convenience
to
choose what time of day to complete their assigned
survey. To assist panel members with their survey-
taking, a personalized “home page” lists all the surveys
that were assigned to him or her and have yet to be
completed.

Panel sampling, data collection procedures, weighting,

Sampling
For this study, the target population comprised
adults 18 years or older who fell into 1 of 3 groups: gun
owners, non–gun owners living in a gun-owning house-
hold, or non–gun owners living in a non–gun-owning
household. An additional target population was veter-
ans (who could fall into any of the 3 groups above). To
sample this population, GfK targeted respondents who
met the criteria above in GfK profile surveys and recon-
firmed their gun ownership and veteran status within
the survey.
The survey had 2 stages: initial screening for gun
ownership and veteran status, and the main survey that
included the study-eligible respondents. To qualify for
the main survey, a panel member must have been aged
18 years or older and not currently serving on active
duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.
Data Collection
Survey pretesting occurred in March 2015, with ad-
ministration of the final survey in April 2015. Potentially
eligible panel members received a notification e-mail
letting them know that a new survey was available for
them to take. This e-mail notification contained a link
that sent them to the survey questionnaire. No login
name or password was required. After 3 days, auto-
matic e-mail reminders were sent to all nonresponding
panel members in the sample. Participants completed
the main survey in a median of 14 minutes.
KnowledgePanel Sample Weighting
GfK structures recruitment for the KnowledgePanel
with the goal of having the resulting panel represent
the adult population of the United States with respect
to a broad set of geodemographic distributions as well
as particular subgroups of hard-to-reach adults (for ex-
ample, those without a landline telephone or those
who primarily speak Spanish). Consequently, the raw
distribution of KnowledgePanel mirrors that of U.S.
adults fairly closely, except for occasional disparities

 that may emerge for certain subgroups owing to differ-
ential attrition rates among recruited panel members.
For selection of general population samples from
KnowledgePanel, GfK uses an equal probability of se-
lection method design by weighting the entire Knowl-
edgePanel to the benchmarks from the latest March
supplement of the U.S. Census Current Population Sur-
vey (www.census.gov/cps/data/). The geodemographic
dimensions used for weighting the entire Knowl-
edgePanel typically include sex, age, race, ethnicity,
education, census region, household income, home
ownership status, metropolitan area, and Internet ac-
cess. Using these weights as the measure of size for
each panel member, in the next step a probability pro-
portional to size procedure is used to select study-
specific samples. Application of the proportional to size
procedure methodology with the above measure of
size values produces fully self-weighting samples from
KnowledgePanel, for which each sample member can
carry a design weight of unity.
Study-Specific Poststratification Weights
Once the study sample was selected and fielded
and all of the survey data were edited and made final,
design weights were adjusted for any survey nonre-
sponse as well as any under- or overcoverage imposed
by the study-specific sample design. For this study, the
following benchmark distributions of gun ownership
from weighted KnowledgePanel data and veteran sta-
tus from the 2014 veteran supplemental survey of the
Census Current Population Survey were used for the
raking adjustment of weights:
Sex, by age (18 to 29, 30 to 44, 45 to 59, 60 to 69,
or ≥70 years)
Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West),
by metropolitan area (yes or no)
Sex, by veteran status (yes or no)
Age (18 to 29, 30 to 44, 45 to 59, 60 to 69, or ≥70
years), by veteran status (yes or no)
Race/Hispanic ethnicity (white/non-Hispanic, black/
Non-Hispanic,
other/Non-Hispanic,
≥2
races/Non-
Hispanic, Hispanic), by veteran status (yes or no)
Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West),
by veteran status (yes or no)
Metropolitan area (yes or no), by veteran status (yes
or no)
Education (less than high school/high school, some
college, bachelor or greater), by veteran status (yes or
no)
Household
income
(<$25 000,
$25 000
to
<$50 000, $50 000 to <$75 000, or ≥$75 000 per year),
by veteran status (yes or no)
Internet access (yes or no), by veteran status (yes or
no)
Veteran serving year (<2, 2 to 3, 4 to 9, or ≥10
years)
Armed services branch (Air Force, Army, Coast
Guard/Marines/other, Navy)
An iterative proportional fitting (raking) procedure
was used to produce final weights aligned with respect
to all study benchmark distributions simultaneously. In
the final step, calculated weights were examined to
identify and, if necessary, trim outliers at the extreme
upper and lower tails of the weight distribution. The
resulting weights were then scaled to the sum of the
total sample size of all eligible respondents.
