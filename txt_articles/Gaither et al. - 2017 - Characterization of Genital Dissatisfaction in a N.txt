We aim to characterize genital satisfaction using the IMGI and
correlate dissatisfaction with sexual activity. We conducted
a nationally representative survey of non-institutionalized adults
aged 18–65years residing in the U.S. In total, 4198 men com-
pleted the survey and 3996 (95.2%) completed the IMGI. Men
reported highest satisfaction with the shape of their glans (64%),
lowest satisfaction with the length of their flaccid penis size
(27%), and neutrality with the scent of their genitals (44%). No

tion,location,andincome)weresignificantlyassociatedwithgen-

genital satisfaction, which included men of all ages, races, and

Introduction
Male genital satisfaction is an important aspect of psychosocial
and sexual health (Davis, Binik, Amsel, & Carrier, 2013). Psy-
chosocialdysfunctionandanxietyareextremelycommoninmen
with genital anomalies (Reiner, Gearhart, & Jeffs, 1999). Men
who have sex with men and a self-perception of below-average
penissizehadpoorermeasuresofpsychosocialadjustmentinlife
(Grov, Parsons, & Bimbi, 2010). Case reports have shown men
undergo risky procedures, such as silicon injections, to lengthen
their penis and increase penile girth (Silberstein, Downs, &
Goldstein, 2008). Despite poor surgical outcomes, men with a
normal size phallus desire to undergo penile enhancement sur-
gery(Vardi,Har-Shai,Gil,&Gruenwald,2008).Onereportof67
menwhopresentedforapenilelengtheningprocedurefoundthat
all of these men actually had a phallic length within several
standard deviations of normal (Mondaini et al., 2002). Genital
piercings, silicone injection, and subcutaneous implants are
increasingly common and are associated with numerous com-
plications (Dalke, Fein, Jenkins, Caso, & Salgado, 2013). Simi-
larly, case reports have shown incarcerated men put themselves
at risk of injury by attempting penile enhancement (Hudak,
McGeady,Shindel,&Breyer,2012).Whetherornotmotivations
forthesebehaviorsstemfromgenitaldissatisfactionisunknown.
Physician views of male genital satisfaction may be skewed
(Davis, Paterson, & Binik, 2012; Mureau, Slijper, Slob, Verhulst,
& Nijman, 1996). Patient satisfaction of penile appearance fol-
lowing hypospadias repair is often less than surgeon satisfaction
(Mureau et al., 1996). Various urologic disorders, such as micro-
penis,hypospadias,Peyronie’sdisease,andgenitalcancers,affect
male genital image. Medical interventions associated with these

the psychosocial needs of patients (Davis et al., 2012). Overall,
men care about their genital appearance; however, the precise
aspects of which is unclear.
Literature onmale genital image islacking.One studyshowed
that approximately 20% of men indicated some dissatisfaction
with their genital size (Herbenick, Schick, Reece, Sanders, &
Fortenberry,2013).How thisdissatisfactionaffectssexualbehav-
ior is not completely known. One recent study showed that men
with ‘
‘small penis anxiety’
’ had reduced intercourse satisfaction,
butweresimilartocontrolsinotherfacetsofsexualbehavior,such
as sexual desire and frequency of intercourse (Veale et al.,
2015a, b). On the other hand, women’s genital satisfaction has
been shown to correlate with frequency of masturbation and
having used a vibrator in the past month (Herbenick et al., 2011),
but few studies have examined male genital self-image and its
relationship to outcomes such as sexual behavior. Herbenick
et al.’s study used the Male Genital Self-Image Scale, which is a
seven-item Likert scale instrument that assesses general genital
satisfaction. The Index of Male Genital Image (IMGI) is a new
scale that measures male genital image. This 14-item scale has
been shown to be reliable, valid, internally consistent, and asso-
ciated with health and psychosocial variables (Davis et al., 2013).
Thisscalehasoneadvantageinthateachitemrepresentsaspecific
aspect of the male genitalia (i.e., size of testicles, erect penile
length), which will enable researchers to investigate genital satis-
factionmoregranularly.Todate,nostudyhasusedtheIMGIona
national level to characterize genital satisfaction among a sample
of men. In doing so, we will understand satisfaction and dissatis-
faction of men’s genitalia and the relationship to sexual behavior.
Aims
Weaimedtocharacterizemalegenitalsatisfactioninanationally
representative sample of U.S. men. In particular, we sought to
determine what men are most and least satisfied with their gen-
itals. In addition, we aimed to characterize men who were dis-
satisfied with their genitals and how this was related to sexual
activity, frequency, and other sexual behaviors. As sexual fre-
quency declines with age (Karraker, DeLamater, & Schwartz,
2011), we hypothesized that poor genital satisfaction would be
associated with age and less sexual activity.
Method
Participants and Procedure
We conducted a nationally representative survey of non-insti-
tutionalized adults aged 18–65years residing in the U.S. We
developed a questionnaire examining the prevalence of injuries
and infections that occur as a result of personal grooming and
associated risk factors. The IMGI was included in this survey.
The survey was conducted with the GfK Group (GfK, formerly
Knowledge Networks). Details regarding GfK study methods
have been reported previously (Gaither et al., 2015; Knowledge
Panel Design Summary, 2013).
Panel members were randomly recruited using address-based
sampling methods. GfK samples addresses from the U.S. Postal
Service’s Delivery Sequence File. Address-based sampling esti-
mates 97% of households can be reached and contacted through
household mail. Once the panel members are recruited, they
receive notification via e-mail to participate in a study sample.
Panel members may also check their personal online member
page to participate in survey taking. The topic of the survey is
giventoparticipants.Participantsdonotseeanyquestionsfroma

current study given to participants was‘‘Personal Grooming

Internet service to all panel members without access to the Inter-
net.Forthecurrentstudy,panelmembersreceived1000pointsfor

In addition to standard measures taken by GfK to enhance
survey cooperation, e-mail reminders were sent to non-respon-
dersonDay3ofthefieldperiod.Apretestsurveywascompleted
in December 2013 to ensure participants understood the ques-
tions. The final survey was conducted in January 2013 in which
7580 participants completed the survey out of 14,409 sampled
via mail (completion rate of 52.5%). GfK consented all partici-
pants prior to the beginning of the survey.

Measures
Predictor Variables
Participants were queried in reference to their entire lifetime.
Participants answered the 14-item Likert scale Index of Male
Genital Image (IMGI) in Question 33a of our survey instrument
(‘‘Appendix’’). Genital satisfaction was determined by a score of
4,5,6,or7.Dissatisfactionwasdeterminedbyascoreof1,2,or3.
Genital neutrality was defined by a score of 4 for one analysis in
order to determine which aspects of their genitalia men felt most
neutralabout.WeusedtheCronbach’saasameasureofinternal
consistency (Bland & Altman, 1997).

 Outcome Variables
We collected the following demographic data: age, race, rela-
tionshipstatus,education,income,geographicregion,andsexual
partnerpreferences.Wealsocollectedsexualcharacteristicssuch
as whether or not participants were sexually active, frequency of
sexual intercourse, and types of sexual behaviors (penetrative
vaginal sex, receptive anal sex, etc.).
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed using the survey function within
Stata 13.1 (Stata, StataCorp, College Station, TX) to adjust and
weight the observations for the complex sampling design. All

Results
General Population
Of the 4198 (51.2%) men who completed the survey, 3996
(95.2 %) completed the IMGI. Baseline demographics of our
participantpoolareshowninTable1,whichdemonstratesthedis-

high (a=0.98).
Overall Satisfaction
The average score on the total IMGI was 68.7 (median=67), or
anaverageof4.9peritem,witha SDof 14.4(Table2).Atotalof
563(14.1%)reportedanaveragescorelessthan4peritemonthe

(85.9%)reportedanaveragegreaterthan4peritemontheIMGI
and thus were classified as satisfied. Men reported highest sat-
isfaction with the shape of their glans (64%), followed by cir-
cumcision status (62%), girth of erect penis (61%), texture of
skin (60%), and size of testicles (59%). Men reported dissatis-
faction with the size of their flaccid penis (27%), length of erect
penis (19%), girth of erect penis (15%), amount of pubic hair
(14%), and amount of semen (12%). Men reported neutrality
with the scent of their genitals (44%), genital veins (43%),

Demographic Analysis
No statistically significant differences were found comparing
demographics of men who reported genital dissatisfaction versus
genital satisfaction (Table3). There were no significant differ-
encesinthemeanageofmenwhoweresatisfiedwiththeirgenitals
versus those who were dissatisfied (45.3±13.3 vs. 44.5±13,
respectively, p = .18). Similarly, there were no significant

Sexual Behavior Analysis
Men who were dissatisfied with their genitals were less likely to
report being sexually active (73.5%) than those who were satis-
fied (86.3%, p\.01) (Table4). Overall, dissatisfied men repor-
ted less daily and weekly sexual activity compared to satisfied
men(1.8vs.4.2and38.5vs.49.9%,respectively,p\.01).Pene-
trative vaginal sex and receptive oral sex were reported signifi-
cantlylessbymenwhoweredissatisfiedwiththeirgenitals(85.2
vs. 89.5%, p=.01 and 61.0 vs. 66.2%, p=.03). No statistical
differences were observed between the number of satisfied and
dissatisfied men reporting penetrative anal sex, performing oral
genitalsex,receivinganalsex,performingoralanalsex,orreceiv-
ing oral anal sex.
Discussion
Thisstudyaimedtocharacterizegenitalsatisfactioninanational
sampleofU.S.menasitrelatestosexualbehaviors.Menreported
satisfaction with shape of their glans and dissatisfaction with the
size of their flaccid penis. Demographic variables were not sig-
nificantly associated with dissatisfaction with one’s genitals.
Broadly,menwhoreportedmoregenitaldissatisfactionwereless
sexually active, had sex less frequently, and were less likely to
reportpenetrativevaginalsexandreceivingoralgenitalsexinthe
last year.
Overall,menweremostlysatisfiedwiththeirgenitalswithless
than a quarter of men reporting dissatisfaction. This coincides
withHerbenicketal.(2013),whoreportedaquarterofmenwere
dissatisfied with their genital size. Our results confirm this find-
ing,as15–27%ofmenreporteddissatisfactionwithpenissize.In
particular,menweredissatisfiedwiththesizeoftheflaccidpenis,
length of erect penis, and girth of erect penis (Table2). The
average flaccid penile length ranges from 6.8 to 10.4cm (Wylie
& Eardley, 2007); however, it is unclear which size thresholds
predict genital satisfaction and whether dissatisfaction comes
from peer-to-peer size comparisons, the so-called shower room
appearance (Khan, Somani, Lam, & Donat, 2012). In contrast to
our findings, Lever, Frederick, and Peplau (2006) found that
45% of men reported that they wanted their penis to be larger.
Thislargerestimateisprobablyduetosomeselectionbias,asthis
wasavolunteerInternetsurvey.Also,thosemenwhomightwant
theirpenistobelargercouldalsofallintothesatisfiedcategoryon
the IMGI. Interestingly, men reported being satisfied with the
shape of their glans (64%), which has little anatomic variability.
Partner satisfaction of these same aspects of male genitalia was
not captured in our study. Discrepancies or similarities between
self-satisfaction and partner satisfaction require future research.
To our knowledge, no other study has used the IMGI to com-
pare demographic characteristics between men with high and
low genital satisfaction. Veale et al. (2014) did show that men
whowereolder,homosexual,orbisexualhadahigherlikelihood
ofreportingconcernordissatisfactionwiththesizeoftheirpenis.
It is possible that men who have sex with men have more oppor-
tunities to compare their size with other men (Grov et al., 2010).
In our study, although there were more homosexual men who
reported overall dissatisfaction, this result was not statistically
significant. It is possible that this analysis was underpowered as
only 5% of men in our sample reported having sex with men or
with men and women. No significant differences were observed
between varying age cohorts among satisfied and dissatisfied
men.Becausemalegenitalimagemayimpactmedicaldecisions

(Veale et al., 2015a, b).
We found that genital dissatisfaction was associated with less
sexualactivity,lessfrequentsexualactivity,lesspenetrativevagi-
nalsex,andlessreceptiveoralsex.Suchdataareclinicallymean-
ingful as penile–vaginal intercourse has been associated with
quality of life and positive mental health (Brody & Costa, 2009).
Positive female genital self-image correlates with increased
vibrator use, frequency of masturbation, having had gynecolog-
ical examinations in the past year, and having performed genital
self-examinationinthepastmonth(Herbenicketal.,2011).How
malegenitalself-imageaffectssexualbehaviorandclinicaldeci-
sion making is less clear. No studies have associated the IMGI
with sexual frequency or behavior. Among young military per-
sonnel,greatergenitalsatisfactionwasassociatedwithlowersex-
ual anxiety and lower episodes of erectile dysfunction (Wilcox,
Redmond,& Davis,2015).Poor sexual function,suchasanxiety
or erectile dysfunction, may be a confounder in the relationship
between genital dissatisfaction and sexual activity. Poorer

 satisfactionmightcausesexualanxietyandthusleadtolesssexual
activity. How poorer satisfaction affects sexual function without
partners, such as masturbation, was not assessed in this study.
Receptive oral sex was reported less by men who were dis-
satisfied with their genitals. Although this finding was only bor-
derline significant due to the false discovery rate calculation, this
finding merits consideration. About three-fourths of men in the
U.S. report receiving oral sex in their lifetime (Herbenick et al.,
2010; Leichliter, Chandra, Liddon, Fenton, & Aral, 2007). In
heterosexualmen,receptiveoralsexisassociatedwithwhiterace
and having a non-monogamous sex partner (Leichliter et al.,
2007). Chambers (2007) reported that men and women perceive
the act of oral sex as less intimate than intercourse. Two inter-
estingfindingsofthisstudyincludethatcollegewomenperceived
oral sex as less intimate than college men, and college men
endorsed power as the most typical reason for receiving oral sex.
It is possible that these twofindingsmight explainwhymenwho
arelesssatisfiedwiththeirgenitalsreportlessreceptiveoralsex.If
men are dissatisfied with their genitals, they might also perceive
themselves as having less power and not want to engage in an
intimate act. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the
connection between genital dissatisfaction and sexual behavior.
However,fromourstudy,itisclearthatlowersexualactivityand
genital dissatisfaction are strongly associated.
This is the first study to use the IMGI in a nationally represen-
tative sampleof U.S.men.Itsstrengthsinclude a large,nationally
representative sample from a well-validated source. The IMGI
showedhighinternalconsistency. Participantscompletedthe sur-
veyviatheInternet,whichfacilitatesprivacyandeaseofaccessas
the survey was of a sensitive nature. Internet access was provided
to all those without access.
Our study had limitations. All individuals contacted must
havehadahomeaddressintheU.S.andbenon-institutionalized.
Thus, these results may not be generalizable. Test–retest has not
been completed on the IMGI.The IMGI hasonly beenvalidated
inonestudy(Davisetal.,2013),andoursurveyasawholehasnot
been validated. Given the sensitive nature of our survey, some
participants may not have felt comfortable answering questions
about sexual behavior or genital satisfaction. Numerical corre-
lation between genital satisfaction and penile length or testicular
size was not possible with our survey instrument. Furthermore,
the impact of psychological or medical conditions, such as
erectile dysfunction, upon genital satisfaction is unknown. The
valence of certainaspectsonthe IMGI (e.g.,genital veins,scent)
was not measured in our survey and thus should be an area of
future investigation. Despite these limitations, our findings aid
the understanding of genital satisfaction as it relates to sexual
activity among U.S. men.
