Humans undergo extensive sensorimotor adaptation during spaceflight due to altered vestibular inputs and body unloading. No
studies have yet evaluated the effects of spaceflight on human brain structure despite the fact that recently reported optic nerve
structural changes are hypothesized to occur due to increased intracranial pressure occurring with microgravity. This is the first
report on human brain structural changes with spaceflight. We evaluated retrospective longitudinal T2-weighted MRI scans and
balance data from 27 astronauts (thirteen ~2-week shuttle crew members and fourteen ~6-month International Space Station crew
members) to determine spaceflight effects on brain structure, and whether any pre to postflight brain changes are associated with
balance changes. Data were obtained from the NASA Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health. Brain scans were segmented into
gray matter maps and normalized into MNI space using a stepwise approach through subject specific templates. Non-parametric
permutation testing was used to analyze pre to postflight volumetric gray matter changes. We found extensive volumetric gray
matter decreases, including large areas covering the temporal and frontal poles and around the orbits. This effect was larger in
International Space Station versus shuttle crew members in some regions. There were bilateral focal gray matter increases within
the medial primary somatosensory and motor cortex; i.e., the cerebral areas where the lower limbs are represented. These
intriguing findings are observed in a retrospective data set; future prospective studies should probe the underlying mechanisms
and behavioral consequences.

INTRODUCTION
Humans undergo extensive sensorimotor adaptation during
spaceflight due to altered vestibular inputs and unloading of the
body. No studies have yet evaluated the effects of spaceflight on
human brain structure. This is despite the fact that recently
reported optic nerve structural changes are hypothesized to
occur due to increased intracranial pressure occurring with fluid
shifts towards the head in microgravity.1 NASA has recently laid
out plans for remote space exploration, including potential human
travel to Mars.2 Microgravity has negative effects on physiological
systems, including muscle and bone mass loss, which are targeted
with exercise and pharmacological countermeasures. Long-term
head down tilt bed rest, an established spaceflight analog, leads to
a superior–posterior shift of the brain within the skull,3 suggesting
that microgravity exposure may lead to similar results.
The untoward effects of spaceflight on sensorimotor function
have been well-studied, including postflight impairments in
posture control4,5 and locomotion,4,6–8 as well as inflight spatial
disorientation,9 reduced mass discrimination10 and increased
manual tracking errors under cognitive load.11,12 Astronauts
gradually adapt their sensorimotor processing inflight in response
to body unloading and altered vestibular inputs. This adapted
sensorimotor state is then inappropriate upon return to Earth’s
gravitational
environment,
with
astronauts
exhibiting
slow
re-adaptation over days and even weeks postflight.8
Based on the extensive literature documenting experience-
dependent brain plasticity,13,14 one might predict that neuroplas-
ticity occurs in sensorimotor cortical regions with spaceflight.
Indeed, experiments conducted with rodents have reported
changes with spaceflight such as alterations in the distribution
of axonal terminal type in the somatosensory cortex15 and
degeneration of Purkinje cell dendrites.16 A recent human case
study reported increases in motor cortex-cerebellar functional
connectivity with spaceflight.17 In addition to specific sensorimo-
tor structural plasticity, it is also possible that the accompanying
cephalic fluid redistribution, sleep loss, and other stressors of
spaceflight would result in nonspecific structural brain atrophy
or edema. Evaluating the extent and nature of human brain
structural changes with spaceflight and how this relates to
sensorimotor performance is critical given the increasing duration
of human spaceflights including advanced plans for remote
explorations to Mars.2 Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to
study brain changes occurring with sensorimotor adaptation
on a much longer timescale than has ever been investigated.
Previous work using brain imaging and stimulation approaches
has found activity in a right lateralized frontoparietal network as
well as motor corticocerebellar regions that is associated with
visuomotor
adaptation18–20

weighted MRI scans and balance performance data from 27
astronauts obtained from the NASA Lifetime Surveillance of

human brain structure, and whether any changes are associated
with the magnitude of balance decrements observed from pre to
postflight.

 METHOD
Study design
The current study is a retrospective follow-up study. T2-weighted
MRI scans of 27 astronauts were obtained from the NASA Lifetime
Surveillance of Astronaut Health. Because of the retrospective
nature of this study, not all MR images were collected using the
same protocol.
Participants
We included data from 27 astronauts of whom 13 completed a
space shuttle mission (~2 weeks) and 14 completed a mission to
the International Space Station (ISS) (~6 months). Demographic
information is presented in Table 1. The astronauts’ age ranged
from ~40 to ~60 years (mean = 48.0, sd = 3.6), while their mission
duration ranged from 12 to less than 200 days. Prior spaceflight
experience in these astronauts ranged from 0 (two astronauts) to
>300 days. The MRI and neurosensory data were collected for
mission-related medical monitoring. All astronauts in this study
provided written informed consent for this retrospective analysis.
Balance control
Balance control was measured using the Sensory Organization
Tests (SOTs) provided by the EquiTest System platform (Neuro-
Com,
Clackamas,
OR).21
Out
of
27
astronauts
there
were
21 subjects with complete SOT assessment at both pre and
postflight assessments where the postflight measurement was
collected within the first two days postflight. We report data from
all trials that were conducted with sway-referenced support
surface intended to disrupt somatosensory feedback and with
eyes closed (SOT5); this test reflects how well vestibular input
could be utilized to maintain balance.
Image acquisition
Within the group of 27 astronauts either (1) low resolution (n = 10)
or (2) high-resolution (n = 17) pre- and postflight image pairs were
acquired:
1)
Low-resolution scans were either sagittal (n = 8) or axial (n =
2) acquisitions. In both cases MRI was performed on a 3T
Philips Intera MRI scanner with an 8-channel head coil.
Sagittal T2-weighted sensitivity encoding (SENSE) images had
the following parameters (TR = 6.1 s, TE = 80 ms, flip angle =
90°, number of signal averages (NSA) = 1, field of view (FOV)
= 240 × 240 mm, slice thickness = 3.0 mm (no slice gap),
50 sagittal slices, matrix = 512 × 512, and voxel size = 3.00 ×
0.47 × 0.47 = 0.66 mm3). Identical parameters were used for
pre- and postflight data collection, except for one out of
these ten subjects for whom post data was collected with a
slightly larger FOV (i.e., 256 × 256 mm) resulting in an in-plane
voxel size of 0.50 × 0.50 mm. Axial T2-weighted SENSE images
had the following parameters (TR = 3.6 s, TE = 80 ms, flip
angle = 90°, NSA = 2, FOV = 240 × 240 mm, slice thickness =
4.0 mm (1mm slice gap), 32 axial slices, matrix = 512 × 512,
and voxel size = 0.47 × 0.47 × 5.00 = 1.10 mm3).
2)
All high-resolution T2 scans were obtained using a 3T
SIEMENS Verio scanner applying a sagittal 3D TSE (turbo
spin echo) SPACE (sampling perfection with application
optimized contrasts by using different flip angle evolutions)
sequence with the following scan parameters: parameters
(TR = 3.2 s, TE = 409 ms, flip angle = 120°, NSA = 1, FOV =
250 × 250 mm,
slice
thickness = 1.0 mm
(no
slice
gap),
176 sagittal slices, matrix = 512 × 512, and voxel size =
1.00 × 0.49 × 0.49 = 0.24 mm3).
Preflight scans were collected at a median of 194 days before
launch (range = 18–627). Postflight scans were collected at a
median of 6 days after return (range = 1–20).
Image processing
Longitudinal voxel-based morphometry and region of interest
(ROI) analyses (see below, under “Sensorimotor Regions of
Interest”) were used to detect significant changes in brain gray
matter volume from preflight to postflight. Voxel-based morpho-
metry involves voxel-wise comparison of probabilistic gray matter
maps that have been transformed to the same stereotactic
space.22–24 The following software packages were used for image
processing: Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) version 1.9.x,
FMRIB Software Library (FSL) version 5.0.8, Statistical Parametric
Mapping (SPM) 8 v6313, SPM 12 v6470, and MATLAB 8.3.0.532
(R2014a).
Preprocessing
Image intensity non-uniformity correction was applied to all T2
images within a subject specific brain mask using N4ITK with a
shrink factor of 2 and 80, 60, and 40 iterations at each level of
resolution.25 The brain masks were created using FSL’s Brain
Extraction Tool26 with robust brain center estimation.
Segmentation
Bias field corrected images were segmented into 6 probabilistic
tissue classes (i.e., gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid,
bone, fat, and air) using unified segmentation with a sampling
distance of 1 under SPM 12.27,28 The unified segmentation
algorithm uses a prior probability map per tissue class and voxel
intensity to attribute the a posteriori probability of each voxel
belonging to a tissue class. Bias regularization was set to ten and
the bias full width at half maximum (FWHM) cutoff was set to 150
because of our initial non-uniformity correction. Segmentation
quality of the high-resolution and low-resolution images (see
Supplementary Fig. 1) was satisfactory.
Normalization
High-resolution images (i.e., 0.49 × 0.49 × 1.00 mm) were down
sampled to 0.98 × 0.98 × 1.00 mm to reduce memory costs and
speed up the normalization process.29 We used a stepwise
approach to transform the preflight and postflight gray matter
maps of each subject into MNI space. This method first registers all
bias field corrected T2 images to an initial template using six

 degrees of freedom. Transformation parameters were stored in
the header of the image to avoid rounding. Separate initial
template images were created for the high-resolution image pairs
and the low-resolution image pairs to fit their initial resolutions.
These templates were constructed by rigid body registration of
the T2 MNI ICBM152 nonlinear symmetric image30 to the average
of the non-transformed data in our sample that were acquired
using a sagittal sequence (i.e., eight out of ten astronauts for the
low-resolution images and 17 astronauts for the high-resolution
image). An initial subject specific template was created from each
co-registered pair of preflight and postflight scans by averaging
the two images and subsequently smoothing the resulting image
with a Gaussian kernel of 1 mm. For further normalization steps
we selected ANTs because it has proven to be superior in
normalization than other algorithms and offers readily available
scripts to create templates and combine warp fields.31 From ANTs,
we used buildtemplateparallel with the initial subject specific
template as reference image with probability mapping as
similarity metric and symmetric normalization as transformation
model to create a final subject specific template. After that, we
calculated the warp from the single subject template to the T2
MNI ICBM152 nonlinear symmetric image (2009a)30 using ANTs
with cross correlation as similarity metric and symmetric normal-
ization as transformation model. For each subject, for each time
point the non-linear warp field from subject space to the subject
specific template and the non-linear warp field from the subject
specific template to the MNI template were combined into one
flow field. From this flow field we obtained the Jacobian
determinant image using ANTs’ CreateJacobianDeterminantImage.
The Jacobian determinant encodes local expansion/shrinkage for
each voxel in the image. The gray matter map of each subject, for
each time point was then warped to MNI space using the
combined affine and non-linear transformations that we obtained
from brining the subject specific and time point specific T2 image
into MNI space. Subsequently, these normalized images were
modulated by multiplying them with their Jacobian determinant
image to preserve the amount of gray matter volume that was
present in the untransformed image. Finally, the modulated
warped images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm
FWHM to increase the signal to noise ratio.
Sensorimotor regions of interest
A spherical ROI around MNI coordinate = 42, −24, 18 with a
diameter of 5 mm (33 mm3) was used to mask out gray matter
volume of the smoothed modulated gray matter images in MNI
space as a proxy of the right vestibular cortex. This voxel
coordinate represents the center of operculum parietale 2 (i.e., the
homolog of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex in nonhuman
primates).32, 33 Volumes of the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus,
and paracentral gyrus were also obtained per subject per time
point by masking out the gray matter volume in these regions
from the smoothed modulated gray matter images in MNI space.
The masks were obtained from the T1 MNI ICBM152 using
Freesurfer.34 Finally, we tested for changes in global tissue volume
of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid.
Analysis
Voxel-wise nonparametric sign-flip and permutation based one-
sample t-tests on pre-to-post GM difference maps with 15,000
random permutations and threshold-free cluster enhancement
(TFCE)35 implemented in FSL’s randomize36 were used to test (1) if
there were local gray matter increases or decreases as a function
of spaceflight, (2) if there was a difference in GM changes between
astronauts who completed a shuttle mission versus an ISS mission,
and (3) if focal GM volume obtained at the preflight scan was
associated with previous flight experience in days (i.e., a cross-
sectional analysis). Non-parametric permutation tests with 15,000
random permutations and TFCE were used to analyze the
association between local changes in GM volume and changes
in balance control. Analysis of this association was conducted at
the whole brain level as well as restricted to those locations in
which we observed significant changes in GM volume from
preflight to postflight and was performed in the whole group as
well as stratified for mission type (ISS versus Shuttle). Because we
only included the non-linear transformation in the Jacobian
determinant image and not the affine transformations, the GM
maps
were
already
scaled
for
head
size
and
subsequent
adjustment for head size was unnecessary. All voxel-wise analyses
were adjusted for multiple comparisons by applying a family-wise
error correction (p < 0.1).
Changes in regional volume and balance control were analyzed
using linear-mixed models with subject as random intercept and
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) as maximum likelihood
estimation because REML is less sensitive to small sample bias
than
traditional
maximum
likelihood
estimation.37
Regional
volumes were obtained from gray matter maps that were scaled
for head size and thereby adjusted for total intracranial volume.
Any significant changes in regional GM volume were correlated
with changes in balance performance using Spearman’s rank
correlation test. Alpha levels were set at 0.05 for all analyses. Stata
SE was used for all analyses (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical
Software: Release 13.1. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).
RESULTS
Astronauts performed significantly worse on measures of standing
balance performance postflight compared to preflight (see
Table 2).
Family wise error corrected analysis of the gray matter maps
revealed significant widespread volumetric decreases as well as
more localized increases. The GM decreases were distributed
broadly around: the temporal and frontal poles, in lateral inferior
temporal and frontal areas, around the orbits, and in bilateral
medial parts of Crus II of the cerebellum. The GM increases
overlapped the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, the posterior
cingulate gyrus, and precuneus cortex (see Fig. 1). We observed
some regions in which GM decreases were significantly larger in
astronauts who completed an ISS mission than in those who
completed a shuttle mission (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, no
association was observed between focal GM volume measured
preflight
and
days
of
previous
spaceflight
experience.
No
correlations were observed between pre to postflight changes in
focal GM volume and corresponding changes in standing balance
performance.
Given
that
altered
vestibular
function
and
central
re-
interpretation of vestibular inputs and body unloading underlies
much of the spaceflight-induced sensorimotor disturbances,38 we
evaluated potential volumetric GM changes in the precentral
gyrus, postcentral gyrus, paracentral gyrus, and vestibular cortex.
Except for the paracentral gyrus, no significant changes were
observed in these regions (see Table 2). Additionally, no significant
changes were observed in global GM, white matter, CSF, and total
intracranial volume (see Table 2). No correlations were observed
between pre to postflight changes in regional GM volume and
changes in standing balance performance.
To aid in the interpretation of the here reported focal gray
matter changes from preflight to postflight we have made a
qualitative comparison of the average focal gray matter changes
in these astronauts with the average gray matter changes that we
observed in a group of 18 subjects who participated in our
microgravity-analog head down tilt bed rest study.39,40 No
statistical tests were run because of differences in pre-to-post
intervals, scan sequence and parameters, and demographic
differences. Figure 3 presents the mean and standard deviation
of pre- to post-intervention changes for both long duration head

 down tilt bed rest and spaceflight. There are extensive similarities
between the two, with the pattern of increases and decreases
shifted somewhat posteriorly in the bed rest subjects relative to
flight. Between subject variability is generally higher in the flight
than bed rest subjects, potentially due to variability in mission
duration and scan quality. A notable exception to these similarities
in mean change and variability is observed in the cerebellum. To
provide insight into the association between GM changes and CSF
changes, we have plotted areas in which the average change over
all subjects in CSF and GM from pre to postflight was larger than
1 %. We then binarized these areas and plotted them on a single
brain to show where GM increases overlapped with CSF increases
and vice versa (see Supplementary Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
We observed significant increases and decreases in GM volume
from pre to postflight in a group of 27 astronauts. The widespread
gray matter decreases were located around the frontal and
temporal poles and the orbits. We also observed small but
localized gray matter increases in sensorimotor brain regions.
There were also significant increases in the paracentral gyrus in
our ROI analysis that we did not pick up in the voxel-wise analysis.
This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that ROI analyses
can be more sensitive to pick up small effects over a larger region
whereas voxel-wise analysis can be more sensitive to pick up large
focal changes, which is one of the reasons why we chose to apply
both approaches.
The GM decreases that we observed could reflect focal changes
in CSF due to the probabilistic nature of the segmentation
algorithm.28 The changes in GM volume overlapped somewhat
with changes in CSF volume in our sample, although there were
also widespread differences. This suggests that the GM changes
that we observe may be related to CSF redistribution. Further
evidence for this idea comes from patients suffering from
idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH41,42). Several
VBM studies in iNPH patients revealed increases in CSF and
decreases in GM (and vice versa) in regions very similar to ours.43–45
Our results are further in line with a spaceflight analog study that
used T2-images to study regional changes in CSF volume as a
function of bed rest; the authors reported CSF decreases in a
predefined location
in
the posterior
parietal subarachnoidal
space.46 However, inferior frontal regions in which we observed
gray matter decreases were not examined in the previous study,
which precludes further comparison. Hence, in general our results
largely parallel findings from long duration head down tilt bed rest
studies in terms of the distribution of GM changes that were
attributed to an upward shift of the brain’s center of mass.3,47 A
qualitative comparison of our data with bed rest data also showed
differences in the regions in which we observed GM changes, such
as in the cerebellum. This suggests that bed rest and spaceflight
have some similar but also unique effects on the brain. Interestingly,
GM volumetric decreases were larger in certain regions including
the insular cortex in astronauts who completed an ISS mission
compared to shuttle flight. Despite the lack of correlation between
days previously spent in space and focal GM volume maps obtained
preflight this finding suggests a dose-response effect for GM
volumetric decreases with spaceflight.
It is possible that the small but localized gray matter increases
we observed in sensorimotor brain regions parallel what has been
reported in studies of neuroplasticity occurring with extended
practice.48,49 For instance, it has been observed that one week of
adaptation training results in gray matter volumetric changes in
the motor cortex which furthermore predicted retention of
sensorimotor adaptation over days.50 In the current study, crew
members were exposed to the adaptive microgravity stimulus
continuously throughout their spaceflight. Typically studies of
sensorimotor adaptation have participants practice for less than
an hour at a time,51 or examine adaptation interacting with injury
or disease.52 In contrast, our findings may represent a greater
reserve in the maximum capacity for neuroplasticity in the healthy
human brain and suggests the utility of enhancing neuroplasticity
to adapt to change in sensorimotor environments as potential
countermeasure application in general.53 It is particularly compel-
ling that the GM increases were restricted to medial sensorimotor
regions which represent the lower limbs. Lower limb muscles are
extensively active on Earth to counteract gravity, and exhibit the
largest morphological changes with spaceflight.54 Increasing GM
volume in the brain regions which process lower limb somato-
sensory inputs and motor control may reflect an attempt by the
system to increase input sensitivity of representations and
adaptation of lower limb control to the microgravity environment.
Indeed a bed rest study has reported that corticospinal excitability
is increased as a function of long term unloading.3 Sensorimotor
novelty and practice have been associated with positive brain
plasticity and protection of neural tissue,55,56 particularly in
sensorimotor brain regions in relation to spaceflight,15,16 and this
may be what led to the sensorimotor structural brain plasticity we

 observed here. Gray matter increases observed with MRI can
reflect different neuroplastic processes that could take place
simultaneously such as gray matter plasticity. Although neurogen-
esis in the adult brain is limited to certain regions (e.g., the dentate
gyrus of the hippocampus, the subventricular zone of the lateral
ventricle, and the olfactory bulb) other neuroplastic changes
including axon sprouting, dendritic branching and synaptogen-
esis, changes in glial number and morphology, and angiogenesis
occur over the adult life course.14
There are several factors that could have affected our results
that are inherent to the retrospective nature of our study. Low
image resolution, considerable intervals between the launch and
pre and postflight MRI assessments, and previous flight experi-
ence
may
have
masked
some
pre
to
postflight
changes.
Additionally, differential time intervals between preflight and
postflight MRI and SOT
assessments
may have negatively
impacted our ability to detect a true correlation between brain
changes and balance performance. Also, even though we did not
observe associations between balance and GM changes, these
structural changes may be associated with other motor disabilities
that occur frequently in astronauts postflight. A controlled
longitudinal prospective study looking into brain changes and
changes in balance, gait, and fine motor skill as a function of
spaceflight is currently underway.39 Ideally, such a study would
include free-water analysis of diffusion tensor MRI to assess fluid
shifts, considering the high sensitivity of this method to changes
in interstitial fluid.57,58 Furthermore, since preflight measures were
obtained generally a long period before flight and therefore, the
changes that we observed could partially reflect the intensive
training that astronauts complete in preparation for their missions.
This effect may be tempered because this preflight training
typically starts at a minimum of 2 years before launch. Preflight
MRI assessment for 20 out of 27 subjects was completed within
one year before launch and therefore, the effects of this training
on brain structure may have already been largely accounted for in
the preflight measure. Despite all of these shortcomings, we still
observed widespread GM decreases and increases occurring with
spaceflight that resemble the pattern of GM changes that we
observed in a microgravity analog bed rest study (see Fig. 3).39,40
This is the first documentation of structural brain changes after
spaceflight in human subjects. Ongoing prospective controlled
studies will be important to refine our findings, to understand the
mechanisms, and to characterize both the performance relevance
and recovery timecourse for these changes. Thus, the potential
underlying
mechanisms
of
these
GM
changes
should
be
considered speculative due to the retrospective and heterogenic
nature of our data.
In sum, our data show structural brain changes occurring with
spaceflight that could be related to cephalad fluid shifts or
neuroplasticity. Moreover, we found evidence of dose-response
effects for GM decreases. More carefully controlled prospective
studies may shed further light on these changes and their relation
to behavioral performance.

Qualitative comparison of focal gray matter changes with bed rest and spaceflight. Images on the two middle rows show average focal
gray matter changes from pre to post-bed rest [18 subjects] and from pre to post-spaceflight [27 subjects] plotted on the ICBM MNI brain. Red-
to-yellow gradients indicate gray matter increases whereas blue gradients indicate gray matter decreases. The top and bottom rows show the
standard deviation of focal gray matter changes in these samples. This overview is intended for qualitative comparison. No statistical tests
were run because of differences in pre-to-post intervals, scan sequence and parameters, and demographic differences
