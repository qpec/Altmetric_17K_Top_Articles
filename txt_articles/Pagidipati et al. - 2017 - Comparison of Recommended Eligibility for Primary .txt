IMPORTANCE There are important differences among guideline recommendations for using
statin therapy in primary prevention. New recommendations from the US Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) emphasize therapy based on the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk factors and a 10-year global CVD risk of 10% or greater.
OBJECTIVE To determine the difference in eligibility for primary prevention statin treatment
among US adults, assuming full application of USPSTF recommendations compared with the
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data (2009-2014) were used to assess statin eligibility under the 2016 USPSTF
recommendations vs the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines among a nationally
representative sample of 3416 US adults aged 40 to 75 years with fasting lipid data and
triglyceride levels of 400 mg/dL or less, without prior CVD.
EXPOSURES The 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy.
RESULTS Among the US primary prevention population represented by 3416 individuals in
NHANES, the median weighted age was 53 years (interquartile range, 46-61), and 53% (95%
CI, 52%-55%) were women. Along with the 21.5% (95% CI, 19.3%-23.7%) of patients who
reported currently taking lipid-lowering medication, full implementation of the USPSTF
recommendations would be associated with initiation of statin therapy in an additional 15.8%
(95% CI, 14.0%-17.5%) of patients, compared with an additional 24.3% (95% CI,
22.3%-26.3%) of patients who would be recommended for statin initiation under full
implementation of the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. Among the 8.9% of individuals in the
primary prevention population who would be recommended for statins by ACC/AHA
guidelines but not by USPSTF recommendations, 55% would be adults aged 40 to 59 years
with a mean 30-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%, and 28% would have diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this sample of US adults from 2009-2014, adherence to
the 2016 USPSTF recommendations for statin therapy, compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA
guidelines, could lead to a lower number of individuals recommended for primary prevention
statin therapy, including many younger adults with high mean long-term CVD risk.

I
n 2013, the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/
American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines substan-
tially expanded the population eligible for statin therapy
by basing recommendations on an elevated 10-year risk of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).1,2 In 2016,
the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released
new recommendations for primary prevention statin therapy
that increased the estimated ASCVD risk threshold for pa-
tients (including those with diabetes) and required the pres-
ence of at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor (ie, hypertension,
diabetes, dyslipidemia, or smoking) in addition to elevated
risk.3 This study used data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare the
proportion of individuals in the United States who would be
eligible for primary prevention statin treatment with the
2016 USPSTF recommendations compared with the 2013
ACC/AHA guideline recommendations.
Methods
For this analysis, we used data from the 2009-2014 fasting
subsample of the continuous NHANES, which contains a
representative sample of the US civilian noninstitutionalized
population.4 We excluded persons younger than 40 years or
older than 75 years, those with a history of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) (defined as symptomatic coronary artery dis-
ease or ischemic stroke), those with a triglyceride level
greater than 400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L), and those with miss-
ing values for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, or
systolic blood pressure.
We assessed eligibility for statin therapy according to
the criteria outlined in the USPSTF recommendations3 and the
2013 ACC/AHA guidelines1 (see eAppendix in the Supplement
for criteria details). LDL-C values were calculated using the
Friedewald equation5; dyslipidemia was defined as LDL-C
level greater than 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) or high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L)
per the USPSTF recommendations; hypertension was de-
fined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, dia-
stolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater, or self-reported
use of antihypertensive medication; and diabetes was de-
fined as hemoglobin A1c concentration 6.5% or greater or a self-
reported diagnosis of diabetes.
We determined the proportion of adults eligible for
statintherapyundereachrecommendationfollowingNHANES
analytic guidelines, using sample weights to account for
the complex multistage probability-sampling design,
nonresponse rates, and oversampling of certain segments of
the population.6,7 Adults with LDL-C levels of 190 mg/dL
(4.92 mmol/L) or greater and those who reported use of lipid-
lowering medications were considered “recommended,” be-
cause pretreatment lipid levels were unavailable. We exam-
ined clinical characteristics and average ASCVD risk8,9 of
individuals with concordant and discordant recommenda-
tions by the 2 guidelines in the overall sample and by age group
(40-59 years and 60-75 years). We also investigated the
reasons some individuals would no longer meet eligibility
for treatment recommendation when transitioning from
ACC/AHA guidelines to USPSTF recommendations. Analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
All individuals provided informed consent to participate
in the NHANES study. The NHANES survey data are available
publically, and the survey has been approved by the National
Center for Health Statistics ethics review board. The analyses
reported in this article were considered exempt by the Duke
University institutional review board (PRO00078278).
Results
After exclusion of 577 individuals (13.6%) with CVD, 66
(1.6%) with triglyceride levels greater than 400 mg/dL
(4.52 mmol/L), and 175 (4.1%) with missing laboratory or
blood pressure data, the study sample consisted of 3416
adults aged 40 to 75 years, free of CVD with triglyceride lev-
els of 400 mg/dL or less. Of these, 747 (21.5% of the primary
prevention population [95% CI, 19.3%-23.7%]) reported that
they were currently taking lipid-lowering medication.
Full implementation of the USPSTF recommendations
would be associated with an incremental increase of 15.8%
(95% CI, 14.0%-17.5%) of US adults receiving statin treat-
ment. In contrast, full implementation of the ACC/AHA guide-
lines would be associated with an incremental increase of
24.3%(95%CI,22.3%-26.3%)instatinusers.TheACC/AHAand
USPSTF recommendations for treatment were concordant for
36.9% (95% CI, 34.4%-39.3%) of individuals (21.5% [95% CI,
19.3%-23.7%] currently taking lipid-lowering therapy; 15.4%
[95% CI, 13.7%-17.1%] not taking lipid-lowering therapy) and
were concordant for no treatment in 53.8% (95% CI, 51.2%-
56.4%). Few individuals (0.4% [95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%]) would
be recommended for treatment by USPSTF but not by
ACC/AHA; these individuals have LDL-C levels less than 70
mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L), at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor, and
a 10-year ASCVD risk 10% or greater.
Key Points
Question How do the 2016 USPSTF primary prevention statin
recommendations compare with the ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines
in terms of the proportion of US adults potentially treated?
Findings Using estimates based on data from 3416 participants
in the 2009-2014 NHANES, the USPSTF recommendations would
be associated with statin initiation in 16% of US adults aged 40 to
75 years without prior cardiovascular disease (CVD), compared
with 24% according to the ACC/AHA guidelines. Of the 8.9% of
adults who would no longer be recommended to receive therapy
under the USPSTF recommendations, 55% are aged 40 to 59
years with a mean 30-year cardiovascular risk exceeding 30%,
and 28% have diabetes.
Meaning Compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines,
adherence to the 2016 USPSTF recommendations could lead
to a lower number of individuals recommended for primary
prevention statin therapy, including many younger adults with
high mean long-term CVD risk.

In contrast, 8.9% (95% CI, 7.7%-10.2%) of individuals in
the primary prevention population would be recommended
for statin therapy under the ACC/AHA guidelines but not
under the USPSTF recommendations. Further exploration by
age group (Table 1) revealed that among these adults, 55%
(representing 4.9% [95% CI, 4.0%-5.9%] of the primary pre-
vention population) were aged 40 to 59 years. This group had
a relatively low mean 10-year risk of CVD (7.0% [95% CI,
6.5%-7.5%]), but their mean 30-year risk was 34.6% (95% CI,
32.7%-36.5%).
Further examination of individuals with diabetes not al-
ready taking lipid-lowering therapy revealed that, among
older adults (60-75 years), the proportions recommended for
statins would be similar under both the USPSTF recommen-
dations and the ACC/AHA guidelines: 2.3% (95% CI, 1.7%-
2.9%) and 2.5% (95% CI, 1.9%-3.1%) of the primary preven-
tion population, respectively (Table 1). However, among
younger individuals (40-59 years), the USPSTF recommenda-
tions would recommend statins for 42% of those recom-
mended for statins under the ACC/AHA guidelines (represent-
ing 1.6% [95% CI, 1.1%-2.1%] vs 3.8% [95% CI, 3.0%-4.6%] of
the primary prevention population).
Table 2 shows reasons that the 8.9% of individuals with
anACC/AHArecommendationforlipid-loweringtherapywould
nolongerberecommendedforstatinsaccordingtotheUSPSTF
guidelines. These include (1) adults free of diabetes and with
10-year risk of 7.5% to 10.0% (5.3% of the primary prevention
population[95%CI,4.4%-6.2%]),primarilymenwithhighrates
of smoking, dyslipidemia, and high median LDL-C levels;
(2) adults with diabetes and LDL-C levels of 70 mg/dL
(1.81 mmol/L) or greater and with a 10-year risk less than 10%
(2.5% of the primary prevention population [95% CI, 1.9%-
3.1%]), primarily younger women with high rates of obesity;
and (3) adults with 10-year risk 10% or greater but no cardio-
vascular risk factor defined by the USPSTF recommendations
(ie, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or smoking) (1.1% of
the primary prevention population [95% CI, 0.7%-1.5%]), gen-
erally older men with lower median LDL-C levels.
Discussion
In this study based on NHANES participants from 2009-
2014, it was estimated that, if fully implemented, the
USPSTF recommendations would be associated with statin
initiation in 15.8% of US adults aged 40 to 75 years without
prior CVD, in addition to the 21.5% of adults already taking
lipid-lowering therapy; in comparison, the ACC/AHA guide-
lines would be associated with statin initiation in an addi-
tional 24.3%. If these estimates are accurate and assuming
these proportions can be projected to the US population,
there could be an estimated 17.1 million vs 26.4 million US
adults with a new recommendation for statin therapy, based
on the USPSTF recommendations vs the ACC/AHA guideline
recommendations, respectively—an estimated difference of
9.3 million individuals. Further exploration of those who are

recommended to receive statins by the ACC/AHA guidelines
butnotbytheUSPSTFrecommendationsrevealedthatyounger
adults (4.9% of the primary prevention population) and per-
sons with diabetes (2.5% of the primary prevention popula-
tion) would account for much of this difference. Even though
younger individuals have modest short-term CVD risk (7.0%
over 10 years), approximately one-third would be expected to
experience a cardiovascular event in the next 30 years. Given
that half of all CVD events in men and one-third in women oc-
cur before age 65 years,10 reliance on 10-year ASCVD risk alone

efit from long-term statin therapy. Alternative approaches to
augmenting risk-based cholesterol guidelines, including those
thatexplicitlyincorporatepotentialbenefitoftherapy,11should
be considered.
This study should be interpreted in light of several cave-
ats and limitations. First, the analysis depends on the repre-
sentativeness and accuracy of NHANES data, which in part re-
lies on self-report. Second, it is not possible to accurately
determine the effects of new recommendations for individu-
als currently receiving lipid-lowering therapy. Third, the analy-
sis did not take into account the controversy that exists over
whether the ASCVD risk score overestimates risk in certain
subgroups.12 Fourth, this analysis was based on a cross-
sectional sample that does not account for changes in risk and
treatment patterns over time. Fifth, the study assumed that
treatment recommendation equated with treatment initia-
tion, whereas USPSTF recommendations and ACC/AHA guide-
lines also recommend an informed risk-benefit discussion be-
tween patients and clinicians.1,3
Conclusions
In this sample of US adults from 2009-2014, adherence to the
2016 USPSTF recommendations for statin therapy, compared
with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, could lead to a lower num-
ber of individuals recommended for primary prevention statin
therapy, including many younger adults with high mean long-
term CVD risk.
