Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is mostly preventable. More in-
formation about the epidemiology and extent of CSD would 
help direct prevention efforts to those at highest risk. To gain 
such information, we reviewed the 2005–2013 MarketScan 
national health insurance claims databases and identified 
patients <65 years of age with an inpatient admission or out-
patient visit that included a CSD code from the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifica-
tion. Incidence of CSD was highest among those who lived 
in the southern United States (6.4 cases/100,000 population) 
and among children 5–9 years of age (9.4 cases/100,000 
population). Inpatients were significantly more likely than out-
patients to be male and 50–64 years of age. We estimate 
that each year, 12,000 outpatients are given a CSD diagno-
sis and 500 inpatients are hospitalized for CSD. Prevention 
measures (e.g., flea control for cats) are particularly helpful in 
southern states and in households with children.
C
at-scratch disease (CSD) is a zoonosis caused by 
Bartonella henselae, a fastidious, hemotropic, gram-
negative bacterium. B. henselae is maintained and spread 
among cats—the principal mammal reservoir species—by 
the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis); transmission to humans 
occurs via scratches, and possibly bites, from cats. CSD 
occurs throughout the United States and worldwide wher-
ever cats and their fleas are found (1). Knowledge of this 
emerging pathogen continues to expand; additional Barton-
ella species, such as B. clarridgeiae, and mammal hosts, 
including dogs, have also been linked to CSD (2–4).
The predominant clinical feature of CSD is lymph-
adenopathy proximal to the site of a cat scratch or bite; in 
many patients, a papule develops at the initial wound site 
before onset of lymphadenopathy. Some patients with B. 
henselae infection experience more serious manifestations, 
such as neuroretinitis, Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome, 
osteomyelitis, encephalitis, or endocarditis (1). B. hense-
lae infection can be particularly severe for patients with 
immunocompromising conditions, such as AIDS, in whom 
vascular proliferative lesions (bacillary angiomatosis and 
bacillary peliosis) may develop (5).
In the United States, CSD is not a notifiable condition; 
therefore, information on the epidemiology of this disease 
has been limited to clinical case series and analyses of hos-
pital discharge databases. Jackson et al. used records from 
the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities 
(1983–1989) and the National Hospital Discharge Survey 
(1978–1989) to estimate incidence of CSD hospitalizations 
to be 0.77–0.86/100,000 population/year. Most hospitalized 
patients were <18 years of age (55%) and male (60%); high-
est incidence was in the southern United States. Although the 
authors also extracted outpatient records from the National 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, only 10 cases of CSD 
were identified, limiting analysis and extrapolation (6).
Reynolds et al. analyzed the Kids’ Inpatient Database 
for the year 2000 and estimated the incidence of CSD hos-
pitalizations to be 0.60/100,000 children <18 years of age/
year. In this study, incidence was also highest in southern 
states but was slightly higher among girls and women (7).
Although the syndrome of CSD was first defined in 
1950, identification of the etiologic agent and development 
of diagnostic tests did not occur until the mid-1980s and 
later (8). Therefore, the epidemiology of CSD may have 
changed in the past few decades because of improved diag-
nostic tests for CSD and other conditions that mimic CSD 
(9). Patients with typical signs of CSD and compatible ex-
posure history can be given a presumptive clinical diag-
nosis; diagnostic tests such as serology, PCR, and culture 
can be useful for confirming typical CSD or for diagnosing 
atypical CSD (1).
To better define the current epidemiology and burden 
of CSD in the United States, we analyzed a large medical 
claims database to 1) describe national patterns of clinician-
diagnosed CSD among inpatients and outpatients, 2) evalu-
ate changes in disease patterns during the study period, and 
3) identify demographic groups at higher risk for CSD. Im-
proved understanding of CSD may facilitate recognition by 
clinicians and identification of risk groups for whom educa-
tion about cats and flea control is particularly helpful.

employer-sponsored private health insurance claims from 
employees, their spouses, and their dependents from all 
50 states. The database contains records for persons <65 
years of age only.
The MarketScan database includes information about 
inpatient admissions, outpatient clinic visits, and emergen-
cy department visits with associated billing codes from the 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). A case was defined as 
illness in any patient with an insurance claims record for 
inpatient or outpatient care that included the ICD-9-CM 
code for cat-scratch disease (078.3) as either a principal or 
secondary diagnosis. Only the first record with the 078.3 
code was counted and considered the incident event. Pa-
tients who had been hospitalized and had also had outpa-
tient visits were counted as inpatients.
Because some persons in the database were covered by 
an included health insurance plan for only part of each year, 
we calculated the denominators for incidence calculations 
by summing the total number of person-months by year, 
region, age, and sex. We then divided these sums by 12 
to yield the number of person-years for each category. To 
assess changes in the epidemiology of CSD over time, we 
divided the dataset into two 3-year periods (2005–2007 and 
2011–2013), with a washout period of 3 years in between.
The cost of hospitalization and outpatient visits was 
calculated by summing total payments for the initial en-
counter plus any subsequent encounter with the 078.3 code 
up to 1 year afterward. Total costs included the primary 
insurance payment, co-insurance, and patient copayment. 
Costs for procedures such as phlebotomy and laboratory 
testing were included if they had an associated 078.3 code. 
Costs of inpatient medications were incorporated into the 
total payments for hospital stay. Outpatient prescriptions 
were included in the total cost calculation if they were for 
an antimicrobial drug recommended for treatment of CSD 
and prescribed within 30 days before or after the initial out-
patient 078.3 encounter (10,11).
To estimate the total annual number of US patients 
<65 years of age with a CSD diagnosis, we first calcu-
lated age-specific and US census region–specific rates of 
CSD within the MarketScan database. We then performed 
direct standardization by multiplying these rates by the 
US population by age and region. Population estimates 
were obtained from the 2010 US Census Bureau Popula-
tion Survey (12).
Descriptive statistics and comparisons were performed 
by using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 
To compare categorical data between inpatients and outpa-
tients and between the periods 2005–2007 and 2011–2013, 
we calculated risk ratios (RRs).
The protocol underwent human subjects review at 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was 
 
determined not to be research involving human subjects. As 
such, institutional review board approval was not required.
Results
Study Population
During 2005–2013, the MarketScan database contained in-
formation on a median of 39,970,145 enrollees for each year 
(range 16,159,068–53,131,420). A total of 280,522,578 
person-years were analyzed during the 9-year study period.
Incidence and Geographic Distribution
During the study period, we identified 13,273 patients 
with a diagnosis of CSD: 12,735 outpatients and 538 in-
patients. Average annual incidence was 4.5 outpatient di-
agnoses/100,000 population (range 4.0–5.7/100,000) and 
0.19 inpatient admissions/100,000 population (range 0.17–
0.22/100,000).
Annual incidence of outpatient CSD diagnoses was 
highest in 2005 (5.7/100,000 population) then steadily de-
clined to a low of 4.0/100,000 population in 2013 (Figure 
1). The decrease in incidence over time occurred primarily 
in southern states. For inpatient admissions, annual inci-
dence remained relatively stable during the study period 
and peaked slightly in 2008 (0.22/100,000 population).
Incidence was highest in the West South Central, East 
South Central, and South Atlantic divisions (6.1–6.4 cases/ 
100,000 population) and lowest in the more arid Mountain 
 
division, where cat fleas are less common (2.2 cases/100,000 
population) (Figure 2). The highest overall proportion of cas-
es occurred in the South Atlantic division (26.3%), followed 
by the West South Central division (19.7%).
Distribution by Age and Sex
Highest average annual CSD incidence for outpatients 
and inpatients was among children 5–9 years of age (9.0 
cases/100,000 patients and 0.4 cases/100,000 patients, re-
spectively) (Figure 3). Children <14 years of age account-
ed for 32.5% of diagnoses overall. Among adults, highest

incidence for outpatients and inpatients was among wom-
en 60–64 years of age (6.6 cases/100,000 and 0.3 cas-
es/100,000, respectively) (Figure 3).
Women and girls accounted for 62.0% of outpatient 
diagnoses and 55.6% of inpatient diagnoses. Although 
most inpatients were female, inpatients were significantly 
more likely than outpatients to be male (RR 1.17, 95% CI 
1.06–1.29) (Table). Incidence among female patients was 
higher than that among male patients in all age groups with 
the notable exceptions of inpatients 0–4, 25–29, and 40–49 
years of age. The incidence difference between adult fe-
male and male patients widened as age increased.
Seasonality
The largest proportion of diagnoses was made during Janu-
ary (10.2%), followed by August–November (9.1%–9.6%/
month) (Figure 4). Diagnoses were significantly more like-
ly to be made during August–November for inpatients than 
for outpatients (Table). Of note, when data were stratified 
by region, a spike in January was apparent for all regions 
but most pronounced in the North Central region and least 
pronounced in the West region (Figure 5).
To account for differences in enrollment by time of year, 
we also compared incidence by using monthly insurance en-
rollment figures and incidence among the subset of persons 
enrolled for the entirety of each year. A similar monthly pat-
tern remained, including the notable spike in January. When 
stratified by age group, patients 10–49 years of age were 
most commonly given their diagnosis in January, whereas 
patients <9 years and >50 years of age were most commonly 
given their diagnosis during August–November.
Comparisons over Time
During the 3-year period of 2005–2007, a total of 2,881 
patients were given a CSD diagnosis (incidence 5.5 cas-
es/100,000 population/year). During 2011–2013, a total 
of 5,522 patients received a CSD diagnosis (incidence 4.4 
cases/100,000 population/year). The MarketScan database 
included records from substantially more patients during 
the latter period, hence the lower overall incidence despite 
a greater number of patients with CSD.
The proportion of patients with CSD who were hos-
pitalized increased from 3.5% in 2005–2007 to 4.2% in 
2011–2013. Patient sex or residence in a rural area did not 
differ significantly between the 2 periods. Patients with 
CSD in 2011–2013, as opposed to 2005–2007, were sig-
nificantly less likely to be <14 years of age (RR 0.79, 95% 
CI 0.74–0.84), to have been given their diagnosis during 
August–November (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87–0.97), and to be 
from southern states (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.73–0.79).
Estimated Cost and Extrapolation to the US Population
The mean cost of care for outpatients with CSD was $244/
patient (median $100; interquartile range [IQR] $68–$169). 
The mean cost of an inpatient admission plus follow-up 
care for CSD was $13,663 (median $8,525; IQR $5,535–
$15,273). Median length of stay for inpatient admissions 
was 3 days (IQR 2–5 days).
After directly standardizing age- and region-specific 
CSD incidence rates to the US population, we estimated 
that each year 12,000 outpatient diagnoses are made among 
patients <65 years of age. In addition, each year ≈500 pa-
tients <65 years of age are hospitalized for CSD. Using

these estimates, we calculated the total annual cost of CSD 
among persons <65 years of age to be $2,928,000 for out-
patients and $6,832,000 for inpatients. Thus, in the United 
States, the total direct medical costs for CSD are estimated 
to be $9,760,000/year.
Discussion
Using data from a large national health insurance claims 
database, we estimated that the annual incidence of CSD is 
4.7 per 100,000 persons <65 years of age and that a total of 
12,500 patients in this age group receive a CSD diagnosis 
each year in the United States. The highest rates of out-
patient diagnoses and inpatient admissions for CSD occur 
among children 5–9 years of age. 
The epidemiology of CSD inpatient admissions de-
scribed in this study was in some regards similar to that 
found by previous studies of national hospitalization data-
bases (6,7). For example, we found that cases occurred pre-
dominantly in southern states and during the late summer 
and fall. Furthermore, incidence of outpatient diagnoses 
and inpatient admissions in the MarketScan database was 
highest among children <14 years of age. We also found, 
however, that children <14 years of age accounted for a 
smaller proportion of inpatient admissions (35.5%) than 
that found by the Jackson et al. analysis of hospital data-
bases (45%–50%) (6). This difference is surprising given 
that the MarketScan databases include information on in-
sured persons <65 years of age only, so the proportion of 
children with CSD in our analysis is artificially inflated.
Although very little data on incidence of CSD in outpa-
tients have been published, our estimate (4.5 cases/100,000 
population) is similar to that reported from an outpatient 
survey conducted in the Washington, DC, metropolitan 
area (3.3 cases/100,000 population) (13). Although Jack-
son et al. reported a higher estimated incidence (9.3 cas-
es/100,000 population), this extrapolation was based on 
only 10 patients identified in an ambulatory care database 
(6). The incidence of outpatient diagnoses—but not inpa-
tient admissions— in the MarketScan database clearly and 
steadily decreased during the study period and should be 
further evaluated by use of other data sources.
Incidence of inpatient admissions reported in this study 
(0.19/100,000 population) is substantially lower than that 
reported in 2 studies of national hospitalization databases 
(0.60–0.86/100,000). Although Jackson et al. and Reynolds 
et al. used different data sources, these studies relied on the 
same basic method of using ICD-9-CM code 078.3 to iden-
tify cases. The reported incidences in both previous studies, 
however, had wider variation and were limited by smaller 
sample sizes (6,7). 
The lower incidence of inpatient admissions found 
by our study is surprising, given that the number of US

households with cats has increased in recent decades to 
an all-time high of 45 million (14). The overall proportion 
of CSD patients who were hospitalized may be artificially 
low because our analysis did not include patients >65 years 
of age, who typically have more comorbidities and thus 
are more likely to be hospitalized. It is also possible that 
patients with atypical manifestations of CSD were given 
ICD-9-CM codes for specific clinical conditions (e.g., en-
cephalitis) but not the underlying etiology and so were not 
included according to our search criteria.
Greater availability and efficacy of flea control prod-
ucts may have reduced risk for B. hensalae transmission to 
humans. Furthermore, while laboratory diagnosis of CSD 
has improved in recent decades—which may bolster the cal-
culated incidence of CSD—diagnostic capability for other 
causes of lymphadenopathy (e.g., neoplasms) has also ad-
vanced and may have prevented overdiagnosis of CSD. 
It is unclear why an unusually high number of cases 
occurred in January. Jackson et al. also observed an in-
crease in hospitalizations during January, although the in-
crease was not as striking (6). A study of Lyme disease, 
which used the same MarketScan database, did not show 
an unusual peak in January, suggesting that it is not artifact 
from changes in insurance coverage at the beginning of 
each year (15). Kittens are typically born in the spring and 
adopted during the summer (16), and kittens 0–6 months 
of age have been shown to be at greatest risk for B. hense-
lae bacteremia. Conversely, C. felis flea abundance peaks 
during fall and winter, and the highest risk for B. hense-
lae bacteremia among cats is during winter (17,18). These 
seasonal variations elucidate the reasons for increased in-
cidence of CSD during the fall but do not fully explain 
the decrease in December and subsequent peak in January.
One hypothesis to explain the January peak is that cats 
are adopted from shelters more often during the holiday 
season, for sentimental reasons or as gifts. However, we 
are unaware of any comprehensive data on cat adoption 
 
statistics by month, so assessing this relationship is dif-
ficult. Of note, stratified analysis showed that the Janu-
ary peak occurred primarily among patients 10–49 years 
of age. Another hypothesis is that teenagers and middle-
aged adults, who typically spend a great deal of time at 
school or work, spend more time during the holidays 
at home in contact with their cats or traveling to other 
houses with cats. Also, cats spend more time indoors as 
temperatures decrease during the winter. These and other 
potential explanations for the unexpected January peak in 
disease should be explored further.
In contrast to several previous studies that report-
ed an overall predilection of CSD among male patients 
(6,7,19,20), our analysis indicated that only 44.4% of inpa-
tients and 38.0% of outpatients were male. The reasons for 
this discrepancy are unclear and should be explored further. 
Compared with outpatients, inpatients were more likely to 
be male (although a minority of inpatients were male), be 
50–64 years of age, and reside in the South. These differ-
ences could results from risk factors for severe disease that 
should be explored further. Differences could also result 
from more accurate diagnosis for inpatients, rather than 
true epidemiologic differences.
Our study has several limitations. First, the case defini-
tion relies on diagnosis by clinicians and subsequent cod-
ing by clinicians or billing specialists, both of which are 
subject to error. For example, the 078.3 code could have 
been inappropriately used for care of a cat-scratch wound 
but not actual CSD. Also, in some cases, the 078.3 code 
may have been recorded as a rule-out diagnosis when CSD 
was not actually confirmed. To our knowledge, there are no 
data on the sensitivity and specificity of the 078.3 code for 
CSD. Furthermore, the MarketScan database is a conve-
nience sample and does not include insurance claims from

persons >65 years of age, military personnel, uninsured 
persons, or Medicaid/Medicare enrollees, among whom 
risk for CSD may differ. Last, the calculated medical cost 
of CSD is probably an underestimate because some CSD-
related visits and procedures may have been missing the 
078.3 code and we did not account for indirect costs such 
as time away from work.
CSD causes a substantial burden of disease nationwide 
and disproportionately affects children. Because CSD is 
a zoonotic infection that is maintained and spread among 
cats by fleas, comprehensive flea control for cats can help 
reduce the risk for human infection. Risk may also be re-
duced by washing hands after contact with cats, to remove 
potentially infectious flea feces that could enter breaks 
in the skin. Furthermore, because cats that hunt outdoors 
are at substantially greater risk for B. henselae bacteremia 
(17), limiting hunting activity of cats may reduce risk for 
human infection. Educational efforts should focus on cat 
owners, particularly those with children in the household 
or those with immunocompromising conditions. Addition-
al research is warranted to elucidate the reasons for epide-
miologic differences noted in this study and risk factors for 
severe disease.
