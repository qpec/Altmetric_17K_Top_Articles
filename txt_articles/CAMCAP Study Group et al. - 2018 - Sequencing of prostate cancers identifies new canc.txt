Abstract 
Prostate cancer (PCa) represents a significant clinical challenge because it is difficult to 
predict outcome and advanced disease is often fatal. We sequenced the whole genomes of 
112 primary and metastatic PCa samples. From joint analysis of these cancers with those 
from previous studies, 930 cancers in total, we identified evidence for 22 novel putative 
coding driver genes, as well as evidence for NEAT1 and FOXA1 acting as drivers through 
non-coding mutations. Through the temporal dissection of aberrations, we identified driver 
mutations specifically associated with steps in the progression of PCa, for example 
establishing loss of CHD1 and BRCA2 as early events in cancer development of ETS fusion 
negative cancers. Computational chemogenomic (CanSAR) analysis of PCa mutations 
identified eleven targets of approved drugs, seven of investigational drugs and sixty-two 
compounds that may be active and should be considered candidates for future clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION 
Prostate cancer is the most common solid cancer in men (diagnosed in 12%) and often fatal 
(9% of male cancer deaths). It is difficult to manage clinically due to a poor current 
understanding of what dictates its highly variable natural history, and of what underlies the 
development of castration-resistant disease1. Extensive data on the structure of prostate 
cancer genomes have been published2-6, including work from our own consortium7-10. 
These studies have identified a number of genetically distinct subgroups, including cancers 
with ERG, ETV1, ETV4, FLI1, SPOP, FOXA1 and IDH1 alterations. Overlapping with 
these categories, cancers may have alterations in PI3K and DNA repair pathways, with the 
latter significantly over-represented in advanced disease4. However, we have relatively 
limited understanding of the ordering of genetic events with the exception that ETS gene 
alteration appears to represent an early event, whilst mutations of AR are later, sometimes 
convergent, events, occurring in advanced and metastatic disease. Indeed, we have very 
little understanding of the evolution of mutational processes, the various genetic paths that 
cancers traverse on their way to progression, the levels of heterogeneity at different stages 
of development or the effect of these factors on clinical outcome.   
Gene status has been used in studies designed to improve the poor predictive value of 
conventional clinical markers (PSA, Gleason sum, stage) and to develop disease 
management strategies. For example, genetic alteration of BRCA1/211, PTEN deletion12, 
amplification of AURKA together with the MYCN gene13, and coordinated loss of MAP3K7 
and CHD114 have been reported to have prognostic value. A number of commercial 
prognostic tests based on gene expression profiles are also available15,16,17 and a 
classification framework has been proposed18. Improvements in the treatment of castration-
resistant disease have been made through better targeting of AR regulation using 
 Page 7 of 43 
 
abiraterone19 and enzalutamide20, whilst PARP inhibitors are effective against cancers 
harbouring BRCA1/2 mutations and other defects in DNA repair pathways21. However, 
significant advances have been made recently through the re-tasking of approved drugs22. 
In the present study, we use previously unpublished whole genome DNA sequencing data 
in combination with published data to provide new insights into the mechanism of 
progression of prostate cancer to lethal disease, and to design novel molecular-based 
strategies for drug targeting. 
RESULTS 
We whole genome sequenced cancerous and matched normal samples from 87 primary 
prostate cancers from the UK and 5 from China, together with 10 hormone-naïve prostate 
metastases and 10 castration-resistant metastases from the USA. Analysis (see Online 
Methods) reveals insights into the nature and order of acquisition of driver alterations, 
genomic heterogeneity in primary and metastatic cancers, changes in mutational signatures 
during progression, and potential drug targets. In addition, we identify coding and non-coding 
drivers by combining single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions 
(indels) within our dataset with those from TCGA4 (425 samples), the COSMIC database23 
(243 samples) and Stand Up to Cancer24 (SU2C-PCF, 150 samples) to give a combined 
dataset, hereafter referred to as the ‘joint dataset’, comprising 710 primary cancers and 220 
metastases. Supplementary Table 1 summarises the genes affected in both our study and the 
joint dataset. 
For the 112 cancer-normal pairs in our cohort, we identified 392,753 SNVs, 54,952 indels 
and 10,921 chromosomal rearrangements (Fig. 1). The mean genome-wide substitution rate 
was 1.23/Mb, with a significant difference in mutational burden between the primary (0.99) 
 Page 8 of 43 
 
and metastatic (2.30) samples (P=4.4x10-15, Online Methods). Moreover, within the 
metastatic subset, mutation burden was higher in men treated with androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT or CRPC) than treatment-naïve cases (2.98 vs 1.61, P=0.015). There were also 
significantly more rearrangements in metastatic than in primary samples (P=0.0059), whilst 
the proportion of breakpoints attributed to a chromoplexy-like event25 was indistinguishable 
between the two groups. Within the metastatic group, the ADT samples had more 
rearrangements than did the hormone-naïve (P=0.027), with no difference in the proportion 
of chromoplexy-like events (Fig. 1). 
Genes of interest were identified through a comprehensive set of analyses to identify: excess 
non-synonymous mutations in coding regions; excess missense mutations within a gene, 
indicative of an oncogenic driver; excess mutations in non-coding regions; regions with an 
excess of structural variants in either ETS+ or ETS- cancers; regions with recurrent copy 
number aberrations in either ETS+ or ETS- cancers. Overall, we identified 73 genes with 
evidence for involvement in prostate cancer development (Fig. 2, Table 1, Supplementary 
Table 2). Based on a literature search, each gene was assigned a high, medium or low level of 
previous supporting evidence (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2). In addition to 22 genes with 
little or no previous evidence of involvement in prostate cancer (Table 1, ‘low’ previous 
evidence), we provide corroborating evidence for 8 further genes previously lacking strong 
evidence of driving prostate cancer (Table 1, ‘medium’ previous evidence). 
Coding drivers 
We identified 28 genes with an excess of non-synonymous coding mutations, five of which 
are previously unknown drivers in prostate cancer (Supplementary Table 2). TBL1XR1 was 
enriched in truncating SNVs and indels and is also located in a genomic region enriched for 
rearrangements in ETS+ cancers (chr3: 172-179Mb) (Fig. 3). These rearrangements result in 
 Page 9 of 43 
 
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or, in one case, homozygous deletion, suggesting a cancer 
suppressor role for this gene. Another significantly mutated gene primarily affected by 
truncating mutations was ZMYM3, which encodes a component of CoREST, a transcriptional 
repressor complex including REST (RE-1 silencing transcription factor) and involved in 
suppression of neuronal differentiation-related genes in non-nervous tissues26. In addition, 
two further CRPC samples from the SU2C-PCF study24 had nonsense mutations and one 
sample within our study had a 70kb exonic deletion in REST.  
Two other genes with recurrent truncating mutations were IL6ST and CASZ1 (Fig. 3). The 
latter is a putative cancer suppressor in neuroblastoma27 while the former encodes 
glycoprotein 130, the signal-transducing subunit of the interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor. The 
pattern of mutations we observe in the joint dataset for IL6ST is dominated by truncating 
events. Moreover, this gene is located in a genomic region recurrently rearranged in ETS+ 
cancers, resulting in either LOH or homozygous deletion (four cases of each), suggesting a 
cancer suppressive role. TBX3, previously reported to harbor mutations in breast cancer28, 
exhibited a mixed pattern of mutations with mostly missense mutations and two cancers 
harbouring truncating events. 
Analysis of missense mutations identified recurrent mutations in seven further genes, of 
which two are newly reported (Supplementary Table 2). CNOT3 exhibited mutation hotspots 
in two amino acid positions, p.E20K (4/932 samples) and p.E70K (5/932 samples), as well as 
a nonsense mutation in a single sample (Fig. 3). CNOT3 has a known cancer suppressive 
function in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia29. Enrichment for missense mutations was 
identified in RPL11 a ribosomal protein and putative cancer suppressor upstream of the 
MDM2/TP53 pathway30. In contrast to previous studies, the enrichment for missense 
mutations in both CNOT3 and RPL11 suggests oncogenic, rather than tumor suppressor, roles 
in prostate cancer.  
 Page 10 of 43 
 
A comparison between coding mutations in metastatic and primary samples within the joint 
dataset identified enrichment in metastases for mutations in TP53, AR, KMT2C, KMT2D, 
RB1, APC, BRCA2, CDK12, ZFHX3, CTNNB1, PIK3CB (Supplementary Table 2), 
confirming previous studies3,24. 
Non-coding drivers 
Analysis of non-coding components of the genome identified two regions significantly 
enriched for mutations. NEAT1, a lncRNA recently reported to be associated with PCa 
progression31, was mutated in 13/112 ICGC cases with significant over-representation in 
patients with metastatic disease (6/20 metastases vs. 7/91 primaries, Fisher exact test, 
P=0.012, Fig. 3). Interestingly, out of the metastatic cases NEAT1 mutations were found only 
in patients that had undergone ADT, consistent with the link between high NEAT1 expression 
and resistance to AR-targeting therapies31. Notably, two of these six cases had two separate 
NEAT1 mutations. The FOXA1 promoter also had significant evidence of selection. This gene 
modulates AR-regulated transcriptional signalling32 and has previously been found to harbor 
recurrent coding mutations5. In our series, we identified 14 samples with coding and 6 
samples with non-coding mutations, with two samples (PD14721a and PD12813a) bearing 
both a coding and a non-coding mutation. Interestingly, we also identified mutations in the 
FOXP1 promoter, a gene with known cancer-suppressive effect in prostate tumorigenesis33, 
in three samples, but this was insufficient to reach statistical significance.  
Structural variant enrichment in ETS+ and ETS- cancers 
The density of rearrangements varies across the genome as a result of various factors 
including chromatin state, GC content, gene density, replication timing and repetitive 
sequence. In order to remove the effect of these factors, we segmented inter-breakpoint 
distance across the genome separately in ETS+ and ETS- cancers and identified regions with 
 Page 11 of 43 
 
differential enrichment for rearrangements between the two subtypes. The functional 
importance of many of these regions was supported by an excess of truncating mutations or 
CNAs.  
In addition to regions previously identified as enriched for rearrangements in ETS+ cancers 
(FOXP1, RYBP, SHQ1, PTEN, and TP53)34-37, two unreported regions were identified. The 
region chr5:55-59Mb covers the genes PPAP2A, PDE4D, MAP3K1 and IL6ST (Fig. 3). In 
IL6ST we also detected significant enrichment for coding mutations, suggesting this is the 
main target of the aberrations. In chr3:171:178Mb, TBL1XR1 is similarly enriched for both 
rearrangements and truncating mutations. 
In ETS- cancers, we confirmed a previously reported enrichment for rearrangements 
containing CHD1(38,39). A target of enriched rearrangements in the region chr1:149-158Mb is 
likely ETV3. In 5/9 cancers, ETV3 was exclusively affected by these events (4 LOH by 
deletion and 1 by translocation). Additionally, one cancer had a truncating mutation 
(p.R413fs*3) and two had missense mutations (p.A73V and p.L37Q). In total, 12 patients had 
localised alteration, 10 of whom had ETS- cancers. Moreover, within the joint dataset, there 
are four cancer samples with truncating mutations in this gene. In contrast to ETV4, the 
nature of variants in ETV3 is indicative of a tumor suppressive role in PCa.  Manual 
inspection of the recurrently rearranged region chr3:76-84Mb identified ROBO1 and ROBO2 
as possible targets (Fig. 3). In total 16/112 samples had an event affecting one or other of 
these genes, and in four samples both were affected. Previously implicated in pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma40, these two genes have not been previously reported in the context of 
PCa. 
Events enriched at chr6:80-114Mb indicate that ZNF292 is a possible target. 11/112 patients 
(5 ETS+ and 6 ETS-) had loss of at least one chromosome copy and in two patients there was 
 Page 12 of 43 
 
a homozygous loss specifically targeting ZNF292. Moreover, the joint dataset contained 
5/932 samples with a truncating mutation, further suggesting a cancer suppressive function 
for this gene in PCa. Another gene affected by recurrent rearrangements on 6q was SENP6, a 
small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease that removes SUMO polypeptides 
from conjugated proteins41, and possibly plays a role in AR function42. Of note, 4/5 
rearrangements in this region affected SENP6 only, leading to a significant reduction in 
expression (Supplementary Fig. 1). Finally, located at chr6:126Mb, the nuclear receptor co-
activator NCOA7 was altered in six samples, one sample having homozygous loss.  
Further regions enriched in ETS- cancers were chr2:133-144Mb (LRP1B), chr8:112-114 
(CSMD3) and chr8:40-41Mb (MYST3). The first two genes are very large and fall within 
reported fragile sites43. Nevertheless, preferential enrichment of breakpoints in ETS- cancers 
may suggest either that underlying structure, such as AR binding sites or nucleosome 
structure, or epistatic interactions between ETS fusion and other rearrangements affect the 
occurrence of rearrangements at these loci. Samples containing structural variants affecting 
MYST3 were found to have significantly reduced RNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 1).  
 
Timing of copy number aberrations 
In order to identify routes to progression in PCa, we developed a novel approach to order the 
occurrence of copy number aberrations by combining information on: the clonality of copy 
number aberrations; timing relative to whole genome duplication; timing of homozygous 
deletions relative to neighboring hemizygous losses. Information from all tumors was 
combined using a Bradley-Terry model, to give the most likely ordering of events. By 
applying a set of logical rules (see Online Methods), we deciphered the temporal ordering of 
subclonal CNAs within each cancer. In general, homozygous deletions appear late in 
 Page 13 of 43 
 
oncogenesis, corroborating previous findings that homozygous deletions are associated with 
advanced disease44-46. Clear differences emerge in the evolution of ETS+ and ETS- PCa’s.  
Where present, the deletion between the TMPRSS2 and ERG genes in ETS+ cancers was an 
early (generally clonal) event, as was gain of chr8q within the locus 112 – 137Mb (Fig. 4a). 
The earliest homozygous deletions in ETS+ cancers include chr5: 55Mb-59Mb, corroborating 
the rearrangements targeting PPAP2A, PDE4D, MAP3K1 and IL6ST, and chr10:89Mb-
90Mb, which covers PTEN (Figs. 3 and 4a). 
In ETS- cancers, losses at chr5:60–100Mb (CHD1 and RGMB), chr13:32-91Mb (which 
includes BRCA2, RB1 and FOXO1), and chr6:73-120Mb are followed by losses at chr2:124-
142Mb, then by gains at chr3:100-187Mb, and then whole chromosome gain of chr7 (Fig. 
4b).  Loss of CHD1 has been previously implicated in the initiation of ETS- prostate cancers, 
preventing ERG re-arrangement in the prostate38 and our data confirm the exclusivity 
between ETS positivity and homozygous loss of CHD1 (Fig. 4c).  
In both ETS+ and ETS- cancers, whole genome duplication (WGD) correlated with loss of 
chromosomal segments at: chr1:94Mb, chr2:140Mb, chr12:12Mb, chr16:85Mb and 
chr17:7Mb (Fig. 4c). From timing analysis, these losses appear to occur co-synchronously 
with WGD in most cases. Gains at chr8:101Mb occurred prior to WGD, chr3:131Mb 
occurred synchronously, and gains at chr7:88Mb tended to follow WGD. 
Timing point mutations and indels 
SNVs and indels were clustered according to their cancer cell fraction (CCF) using a 
Bayesian Dirichlet process47. The proportion of SNVs identified as subclonal showed 
considerable variation across cancers, but was significantly higher in primary than metastatic 
samples (Fig. 5a, P=0.022, Wilcoxon rank sum test), as was the proportion of subclonal 
indels (P=0.00033) and the fraction of the genome with subclonal copy number aberrations 
 Page 14 of 43 
 
(P=0.0037, Supplementary Fig. 2). This is apparent evidence for a bottleneck in acquiring 
metastatic potential rather than a response to treatment, since levels of heterogeneity in 
untreated metastases are no lower than in androgen-deprived metastases (Fig. 5a). 
The levels of heterogeneity observed in SNVs and indels were correlated (Fig. 5a, Pearson r 
= 0.57, P=2.3x10-9). Higher levels of heterogeneity were observed amongst indels than SNVs 
(P=2.4x10-8). However, it cannot be ruled out that variant calling of indels may have greater 
sensitivity for low allele frequency variants than calling of SNVs. 
Driver SNVs were identified as clonal or subclonal in each sample according to the cluster to 
which they were assigned, with 84 classified as clonal and 22 (21%) as subclonal. Our power 
to detect subclonal mutations is limited by sequencing depth and the real number of subclonal 
driver mutations is likely much higher. The driver mutations identified as subclonal include 
two mutations in APC in the same sample, PD14713a. Interestingly, this cancer has 
undergone clonal loss of one copy of chr5q, followed by mutations in APC in 2 different 
subclones (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting convergent evolution. Five other 
samples each have two subclonal drivers: PD12808a has a missense mutation in ZNF292 and 
an essential splice site mutation in SMAD2; PD13401a has a nonsense mutation in PPP1R3A 
and a mutation in the promoter of NEAT1; PD13402a has a nonsense mutation in USP34 and 
an essential splice site mutation in ABI3BP (Fig. 5b); PD12820a has a missense mutation in 
USP48 and an essential splice site mutation in ASXL2; PD13389a has a frameshift mutation 
in PHF12 and an essential splice site mutation in TBX3 (not shown). 
Subclonal mutations are also seen in several common drivers including one in TP53 
(PD13339a) and one in PTEN (PD12840a). On the other hand, SPOP was mutated in 10 
samples, always clonally and always in ETS- tumors (Fig. 2).  
Mutational signatures 
 Page 15 of 43 
 
Analysis of the mutational signatures by non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) revealed 
that, in addition to the ubiquitous ‘clock-like’ signatures 1 and 5, there was presence of the 
previously described signatures 2, 3, 8, 13 and 1848. Signature-3-positive samples were 
enriched for germline/somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 genes (4/6 samples) as reported 
previously48 (Fig. 1). However, the presence of high levels of microhomology (MH)-
mediated deletions was even more strongly correlated with the presence of BRCA mutations 
(6/6 samples). Separating the mutations into early clonal, late clonal and subclonal epochs, as 
described in Online Methods, revealed that the proportion of signature 1 mutations decreases 
over time, suggesting an increase of cancer-associated mutagenic processes relative to innate 
processes (P=2.2x10-16, test for trend in proportions). 
Signature 13, previously associated with the activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine 
deaminases, was over-represented in advanced disease, 45% (9/20) in metastases vs. 14% 
(14/92) in primaries (Fisher exact test, P=5.6x10-3). Similarly, signature 18, which has been 
previously associated with failure of base excision repair and to the accumulation of 
mutations from 8-Oxoguanine damage49, was enriched in advanced disease, 40% (8/20) in 
metastases vs. 11% (10/92) in primaries (Fisher exact test, P=3.8x10-3). In a recent report of 
560 breast cancer whole-genomes, signature 8 correlated with DNA damage repair 
deficiency50. Androgen signalling is known to positively regulate multiple genes involved in 
DNA repair51,52, while androgen deprivation impairs DNA double-strand break repair53. In 
support of these previous reports, the proportion of mutations assigned to signature 8 is 
consistently higher amongst later appearing (subclonal) populations of cells (55% ± 24%) 
than earlier (clonal) populations (28% ± 12%) (t-test, P=1.3×10-4, Supplementary Table 3). 
The proportion of metastases with evidence for the action of signature 8 was higher than that 
for primary tumors, although not reaching statistical significance (8/20 metastases, 25/92 
primaries, Fisher exact test P=0.28). Increased prevalence of DNA-damage related genes in 
 Page 16 of 43 
 
metastatic prostate cancer as well as the observations made in this study warrant an extensive 
study of mutational signatures in therapy-naïve disease and CRPC in a larger dataset to 
explore the relevance of check-point inhibition as an alternative therapy for advanced prostate 
cancer. 
Clinical correlates 
CDH12 and ANTXR2 alterations were significantly associated with time to biochemical 
recurrence (Benjamin-Hochberg adjusted P = 0.0060 (CDH1) & 0.012 (ANTXR2), HR = 9.3 
& 7.7, Cox regression model, Fig. 6), and were significant predictors of biochemical 
recurrence independent of cofactors Gleason, PSA at prostatectomy, and pathological T-stage 
(P = 0.00061 (CDH1) & 0.0015 (ANTXR2), HR = 7.3 & 6.5, Cox regression model, 
Supplementary Table 4). A Cox regression model containing a combination of CDH12, 
ANTXR2, SPOP, IL6ST, DLC1 & MTUS1 mutations was determined to be an optimal 
predictor of time to biochemical recurrence and was a significant improvement over a 
baseline model of Gleason, PSA at prostatectomy, and pathological T-stage (model χ2 test, P 
= 0.00053). The number of mutational signatures identified in a cancer was negatively 
correlated with time to biochemical recurrence in prostatectomy patients (P = 0.014, HR = 
3.0; Cox proportional hazards model on number of processes greater than 3, Supplementary 
Fig. 4) and is an independent predictor (P = 0.0061, HR = 3.6; Cox proportional hazards 
model). The number of SNVs detected was also an independent prognostic biomarker 
(P=0.031, HR=1.005; Cox proportional hazards model). The numbers of both samples and 
events within this study are modest and further analysis of larger cohorts is required to 
establish firmly these findings.

Druggable targets in the prostate cancer disease network 
A key opportunity arising from systematic analyses of cancer genomics is the early 
identification of therapeutic intervention strategies. To this end, we applied established 
chemogenomic technologies using the canSAR knowledgebase54 to map and 
pharmacologically annotate the cellular network of the prostate disease genes identified in 
this study. We derived the network using curated protein-protein and transcriptional 
interaction data. We included the protein products of the genes identified in this study and 
other key proteins that directly interact with these proteins or affect their function (see 
Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5 for details). This resulted in a focussed prostate 
network of 156 proteins. Each protein was annotated based on multiple assessments of 
‘druggability’, i.e. the likelihood of the protein being amenable to small molecule drug 
intervention (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 5). We find that PCa driver genes are 
embedded in a highly druggable cellular network that contains eleven targets of approved 
therapies and seven targets of investigational drugs. As well as the Androgen Receptor 
(AR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), the network contains targets of drugs 
approved for other indications, several of which (e.g. BRAF, ESR1, RARA, RXRA, 
HDAC3) are under clinical investigation for PCa.  
Seven proteins within the prostate network are targets of drugs currently in clinical trials. 
In particular, the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor AZD-0156, currently in 
Phase 1 for safety assessment, is a likely candidate for exploration in PCa due to the 
recently described role of DNA damage repair, particularly in advanced PCas21,55. The 
network highlights targets of PI3 Kinase pathway inhibitors (PI3K, AKT1) that are 
undergoing clinical investigation in PCa, as well as IDH1 and MDM2 drug targets.  
 Page 18 of 43 
 
To give an indication of the potential of these drugs, we analysed the most recent drug 
sensitivity data (GDSC56, see URL below). Eighteen drugs acting on our network were tested 
in GDSC on PCa cell lines. Of these, 5 showed significant effect on growth inhibition and the 
remaining13 drugs showed weak activity in at least one cell line (Supplementary Table 6). 
However, to validate fully the potential of these drugs, extensive drug sensitivity testing 
needs to be performed in disease-relevant cancer models that correctly reflect the patient 
population. 
Potential future opportunities for PCa therapy are also highlighted by 13 proteins that are 
under active chemical biology or drug discovery investigation (Table 2). These include 
Menin (MEN1), a component of the MLL/SET1 histone methyltransferase complex. Mice 
with MEN1 mutations develop PCa57 and recent data have shown that menin expression is 
involved in CRPC58. A further 49 proteins are predicted to be druggable and therefore 
potentially amenable to drug discovery. These include the known PCa protein SPOP, the 
transcription activator BRG1 (SMARCA4), CDK12, and the CREB binding protein 
CREBBP.  
In summary, we find that 80 of the 156 proteins central to the prostate disease network are 
either targets of existing drugs or have the potential to be targeted in the future. To maintain 
an up-to-date-view of this analysis, we provide a link to a live-page in canSAR (see link 
below). 
 
DISCUSSION  
The analysis of whole genome sequence data from 112 prostate cancers has revealed many of 
the genetic factors underlying the processes of carcinogenesis, progression, metastasis and 
 Page 19 of 43 
 
the acquisition of drug resistance. Supporting evidence has been provided for thirty candidate 
driver genes with limited or no previous support, including the non-coding drivers NEAT1 
and FOXA1. 
Through the timing of genomic aberrations, we have a picture of the possible routes to 
progression in PCa. Most driver mutations may occur either clonally or subclonally, but 
mutations in SPOP and ETS-fusions occur early in cancer development and are exclusively 
clonal. Whereas the gain of 8q and ETS fusion appear to be sufficient to drive a dominant 
clonal expansion, ETS- cancers typically need a combination of large-scale losses, acquired 
over an extended period of time. Known cancer drivers are frequently observed subclonally 
and two competing drivers are seen in several cancers. Metastases have less genomic 
heterogeneity, likely resulting from a bottleneck in achieving metastatic potential.  
We observe changes in the mutational processes operative upon cancers during progression. 
Signature 8 was enriched in subclonal expansions, and signatures 13 and 18 were enriched in 
metastatic cancers. Cancers with germline or somatic BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were 
enriched for signature 3, demonstrating the effect of double-strand repair defects throughout 
cancer evolution. 
Losses of CDH12 and ANTXR2 result in poorer recurrence-free survival. We identify 69 PCa 
associated proteins that are either targets for currently available drugs or new potential targets 
for therapeutic development. 
Analysis of the whole-genome sequences of over a hundred prostate cancers has started to 
reveal the complex evolutionary pathways of these cancers. The early acquisition of driver 
aberrations including ETS-fusions and whole genome duplications strongly affects the 
acquisition of subsequent aberrations. Acquisition of individual mutations affects both the 
subsequent likelihood of metastasis and response to treatment. Network analyses identified, 
 Page 20 of 43 
 
in addition to previously known drivers, targets that could be exploited for clinical 
investigation with existing drugs as well as targets for new drug discovery, giving potential 
for the results of genome analysis to be translated rapidly into therapeutic innovation and 
patient benefit.

of DNA repair genes, ETS fusion status and sample type; proportion of mutations assigned to 
each signature48; number of SNVs identified in each sample; proportion of small 
insertions/deletions associated with microhomology or repetitive regions; number of 
insertions, deletions and complex insertions/deletions in each sample; total number of 
structural variants in each sample, separated into inversions, translocations, deletions and 
tandem duplications. Sample ordering is reported in Supplementary Table 7.  
Figure 2. Landscape of driver genes in prostate cancer. Genes were identified using three 
different methods: upper panel shows genes that have undergone genetic aberration in at least 
6 samples (n=112 biologically independent samples); middle panel shows genes with 
aberrations enriched in either ERG+ or ERG- cancers (Fisher exact test for PTEN, TP53, 
SPOP, 3p13, PDE4D, PPAP2A; ROBO1 and ROBO2 are in a region enriched for SVs in 
ETS- tumors; IL6ST is in a region enriched for SVs in ETS+ tumors; n=59 ETS+, n=53 ETS

biologically independent samples); lower panel shows genes enriched in metastatic samples 
(Fisher exact test, n=20 metastatic, n=98 primary biologically independent samples). Right-
hand bar graphs show the fraction of samples bearing each type of aberration. DDR = DNA 
damage response, ‘hemi.loss’ = loss of heterozygosity resulting from copy number change, 
‘homo.loss’ = homozygous deletion resulting from copy number aberration, ‘two allele loss + 
sub/indel’ indicates genes in triploid regions bearing aberrations of all 3 gene copies. Sample 
ordering is reported in Supplementary Table 7. 
Figure 3. Putative novel driver genes. Putative drivers are shown in red and genomic 
aberrations are displayed as: missense SNVs – circles; nonsense SNVs – open triangles; 
essential splice site mutations – open squares;  indels – closed squares; non-coding mutations 
– closed triangles; simple SV - yellow cross; chromoplexy event – blue cross; region enriched 
for loss of heterozygosity, with height proportional to the number samples containing LOH - 
pink shading; region enriched for homozygous deletions, with height proportional to the

Figure 5. Heterogeneity and subclonal mutations. (a) Metastatic tumors have less 
heterogeneity than primary tumors, whether assessed from SNVs or indels. Each dot 
represents a different sample, colored by sample type. x-axis = fraction of SNVs that are 
subclonal, y-axis = fraction of indels that are subclonal, contour lines calculated using R 
package kde2d. n= 93 biologically independent samples (10 ADT metastases, 9 hormone 
naïve metastases, 74 primary tumors) (b) Samples with multiple subclonal mutations in driver 
genes. Fraction of cancer cells carrying mutation is shown as grey histogram for all mutations 
and as red ovals for mutations in known driver genes. Mutations are clustered using a 
Dirichlet process as previously described47, with thick plum-colored lines indicating fitted 
distribution and pale blue regions indicating 95% posterior confidence intervals. Peaks with a 
subclonal fraction close to 1 are clonal, whereas peaks at lower subclonal fractions indicate 
subclonal mutations.

information was available for 89 prostatectomy samples with WGS data, with a median 
follow up of 1108 days in which biochemical recurrence occurred in 26 patients. The 
mutations in both genes consisted of a frameshift deletion in one sample and structural

Table 1. Putative driver genes. Genes were identified in our study using several methods, 
detailed in the last column: dN/dS; enrichment for SVs or CNAs in ETS+ or ETS- cancers; 
enrichment for truncating mutations or homozygous deletions, clinical correlation. From a 
PubMed literature search, prior evidence for each gene being a driver of prostate cancer was 
classified as ‘low’ if the gene has not been previously reported as playing a role in prostate 
cancer tumorigenesis or progression. Isolated alterations may have been observed or 
biological evidence for importance may have been presented as indicated in the prior 
evidence column. Prior evidence was classified as ‘medium’ for genes reported previously as 
playing a role in prostate carcinogenesis or progression but currently lacking statistical 
support based on genetic alterations. Evidence considered included presence of multiple 
genetic alterations, SNP associations, and known cancer genes in other tissues. The high 
confidence genes are those that are widely accepted to represent cancer genes and to be 
altered in prostate cancer: this would include genes such as HRAS, SPOP, IDH1 etc. In each 
case there are two or more of the following: statistical verification of higher incidence, 
biological experiments, clinical correlations, confirmation in multiple studies, recognition as 
cancer genes in other cancer types. dN/dS = non-synonymous: synonymous ratio, calculated 
for all SNVs and indels; dN/dS (missense) = non-synonymous: synonymous ratio, calculated 
for missense SNVs only; SV = structural variant; CNA = copy number aberration; SNV = 
single nucleotide variant; indel = small insertion/deletion; ETS = E26 transformation-
specific.

ONLINE METHODS 
Patient Cohorts, Samples and Ethics 
We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations. 92 cancer samples from 
prostatectomy patients treated at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, at the 
Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, and at 
Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China were collected as described previously68,69. Clinical 
details for the patients are shown in Supplementary Table 7. Ethical approval was obtained 
from the respective local ethics committees and from The Trent Multicentre Research Ethics 
Committee. All patients were consented to ICGC standards. (see link below).   20 men from 
PELICAN (Project to ELIminate lethal CANcer)70, an  integrated clinical-molecular autopsy 
study of metastatic prostate cancer,  were the subjects of the current study. Subjects 
consented to participate in the Johns Hopkins Medicine IRB-approved study between 1995 
and 2005. (Supplementary Table 7). A17 had a germline BRCA1 mutation, as previously 
reported71. 
DNA preparation and DNA sequencing 
DNA from whole blood samples and frozen tissue was extracted and quantified using a ds-
DNA assay (UK-Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Assay Kit for DNA) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions with a Fluorescence Microplate Reader (Biotek SynergyHT, 
Biotek). Acceptable DNA had a concentration of at least 50ng/μl in TE (10mM Tris/1mM 
EDTA), was between 1.8-2.0 with an OD 260/280. WGS was performed at Illumina, Inc. 
(Illumina Sequencing Facility, San Diego, CA USA) or the BGI (Beijing Genome Institute, 
Hong Kong), as described previously, to a target depth of 50X for the cancer samples and 
30X for matched controls68.  
 Page 32 of 43 
 
 The Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) was used to align the sequencing data to the GRCh37 
reference human genome72. Sequencing data have been deposited at the European Genome-
phenome Archive (EGAS00001000262). 
Variant Calling Pipeline 
SNVs, insertions and deletions were detected using the Cancer Genome Project Wellcome 
Trust Sanger Institute pipeline as described previously68. In brief, SNVs were detected using 
CaVEMan with a cut-off ‘somatic’ probability of 95%. Post-processing filters were applied. 
Insertions and deletions were called using a modified version of Pindel73. Variant allele 
frequencies of all indels were corrected by local realignment of unmapped reads against the 
mutant sequence. Structural variants were detected using Brass68. A positive ETS status was 
assigned if a breakpoint between ERG, ETV1 or ETV4 and previously reported partner DNA 
sequences was detected. 
Data availability 
Sequencing data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in the European 
Genome-phenome Archive with the accession code EGAS00001000262.(see link below).  
See Supplementary Table 7 for sample specific EGA accession codes. 
Code availability 
Alignment and variant calling was performed using analysis pipelines in the Cancer Genome 
Project (CGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Software versions applied to each 
sample are listed in Supplementary Table 9. The CGP pipelines may be downloaded (see link 
below). 
Chromoplexy was called using Chainfinder version 1.0.1. Chainfinder may be downloaded 
(see link below) 
 Page 33 of 43 
 
The Battenberg algorithm was used to call clonal and subclonal copy number aberrations in 
all samples. The Battenberg pipeline may be downloaded (see link below). 
Putative drug targets were identified using CanSAR version 3.0. 
Data analysis was carried out using R, version 3.0.0. 
Mutation burdens 
Mutation burdens were compared between primary and metastatic samples and between ADT 
and hormone-naïve samples using a negative binomial generalised linear model (GLM), 
implemented with the R package MASS. Sample type was found to be an independent 
predictor of number of SNVs, as was age at time of sampling. 
Timing of copy number events 
We developed a novel approach to order the occurrence of copy number aberrations by 
combining three sources of information: 
 Clonality of copy number aberrations 
 Timing relative to whole genome duplication 
 Timing of homozygous deletions relative to neighboring hemizygous losses. 
Information from all tumors was combined using a Bradley-Terry model, to give the most 
likely ordering of events during progression of PCa. 
The Battenberg algorithm was used to detect clonal and subclonal somatic copy-number 
alterations (CNAs) and to estimate ploidy and cancer content from the next-generation 
sequencing data as previously described74. Briefly, germline heterozygous SNPs were 
phased using Impute2, and a- and b- alleles were assigned. Data were segmented using 
piecewise constant fitting75 and subclonal copy-number segments were identified via a t-
test as those with b-allele frequencies that differed significantly from the values expected 
 Page 34 of 43 
 
of a clonal copy number state. Ploidy and cancer purity were estimated with the same 
method used by ASCAT76. 
In this cohort, we defined WGD samples as those that had an average ploidy greater than 3. 
For tumors that had not undergone WGD, gains were defined as those regions that had at 
least one allele with copy number greater than 1, while losses were defined as those segments 
that undergone LOH. For tumors that had undergone WGD, losses were called in those 
segments with at least one allele with copy number of less than 2, whereas gains were called 
for those with an allelic copy number greater than 2. An extension of this logic was used for 
subclonal copy number segments – the evolving cellular fraction was always defined as that 
which deviated away from overall ploidy (defined as 2 for non-WGD samples and 4 for 
WGD samples). For example, if 75% of cells within a non-WGD tumor have a copy number 
of 3 + 1 at a given genomic loci, with the remaining 25% of cells having a copy number of 2 
+ 1, then we assume there has been clonal gain to 2 + 1, and then a subclone containing 75% 
of cells has undergone a further gain. 
Three independent approaches were used to extract evolutionary data from each cancer 
sample. The first involved ordering clustered sub-clonal cancer fractions, the second used 
implicit ordering of clonal HDs in relation to losses, and the third estimated the relative 
timing of whole genome duplication. The logical arguments used within each approach were 
considered in turn: 
1. 
Battenberg algorithm-derived estimates for the cellular fraction and standard 
deviation of each subclonal aberration were input to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
hierarchical Bayesian Dirichlet process to group linked events together in an unsupervised 
manner. This defined clusters of different cell populations, each present at a calculated cancer 
cell fraction. The pigeonhole principle was then used to determine the hierarchical 
 Page 35 of 43 
 
relationship between these clusters. Using this process, gains, losses and HDs were ordered 
with the following caveat to ensure that only independent events are ordered: if there was a 
clonal and subclonal gain (or loss) at the same locus, then only the clonal or initial gain (or 
loss) was ordered. 
2. 
Homozygous deletions have implicitly occurred after loss of heterozygosity at the 
same locus. 
3. 
The parsimony principle was used to define the allele counts that correspond to early 
and late changes in relation to WGD. For losses, if the minor allele copy number equals 0, 
then the loss occurred prior to WGD. Otherwise the loss occurred after WGD.  Regarding 
gains, if the major allele copy number is twice or greater than ploidy, then the gain occurred 
prior to WGD. Otherwise, the gain occurred after WGD. 
The above arguments allow us to gain insights into the order of copy number events within 
each individual tumor sample. To establish a consensus order across a cohort of tumor 
samples requires the ordering data to be integrated across all samples.  As specific copy 
number events (location of breakpoints and the individual copy number states) tend to be 
unique to individual samples, we defined reference copy number segments that occurred 
recurrently.  These were then used to build an overall contingency table. 
The reference genomic segments were defined as regions that were recurrently aberrant. 
Regions of significant recurrence (false detection rate (FDR), P < 0.05) were determined by 
performing 100,000 simulations, placing the copy number aberrations detected from each 
sample in random locations within the genome. The process was repeated for gains, LOH and 
HDs and the randomly generated copy number landscape compared to that arising from this 
cohort provided significance levels.  Each significantly aberrant region was initially 
segmented using all breakpoints from all the events that contributed to that region. For 
 Page 36 of 43 
 
instance, the significantly enriched region for LOH: chr8: 0-44Mb contains over 300 
breakpoints drawn from from all the samples which contain LOH at chromosome 8p. We 
computed significantly recurrent regions and reference segments for both ETS+ and ETS- 
sample subgroups. 
Performing pair-wise comparisons between all segmented results using the Bradley-Terry 
method described below proved computationally expensive and therefore the total number of 
segments used in the pairwise comparison was rationalised by grouping reference segments 
to make combined segments of minimum length 1 MB. 
We then considered each tumor sample in turn.  If any copy number event overlapped the 
reference genomic segments and was ordered in relation to any other event (that also 
overlapped regions of significance), those overlapped reference segments were ordered in 
comparison to other overlapped reference segments. In addition to these reference segments, 
the TMRPSS2-ERG deletion was ordered more stringently by considering only those 
segments that could result in the gene fusion, and not merely overlap the locus. In this 
manner, a contingency table of contests was constructed, using reference genomic segments 
as the variables. We built contingency tables for both ETS+ and ETS- tumor samples to 
determine whether their evolutionary trajectory differed significantly. .   
An implementation of the Bradley-Terry model of pairwise comparison in R77 with bias 
reduced maximum likelihood estimated the ability or overall order of each individual 
reference segment. 
Subclonal Analysis 
The fraction of each cancer genome with subclonal copy number aberrations was calculated 
as the total amount of the genome with subclonal CNA, as identified by the Battenberg 
 Page 37 of 43 
 
algorithm, divided by the total amount of the genome that had copy number aberrations. One 
sample (PD13397a, Supplementary Table 8) was identified as having very low cellularity, as 
it had a completely flat copy number profile and only 411 identified SNVs. Since CNAs 
could not called in this sample, it was not possible to adjust allele frequencies to CCFs and 
this sample was excluded from subclonality analysis. SNVs and indels were separately 
clustered using a Bayesian Dirichlet process, as previously described47. Clonal variants are 
expected to cluster at a CCF close to 1.0. However, in 18 tumors (Supplementary Table 8), 
there was no cluster in the range [0.95,1.05]. The likely cause of a shift in CCF is inaccuracy 
in copy number calling and these samples therefore failed quality control and were excluded 
from subclonality analysis. From Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling carried out within the 
Dirichlet process model, the posterior probability of each variant having a CCF below 0.95 
was estimated. Variants with a probability above 80% were designated as ‘subclonal’, those 
with probability below 20% were designated ‘clonal’ and those with intermediate 
probabilities were designated as ‘uncertain’. The fraction of subclonal variants used in Fig. 5 
and Supplementary Fig. 2 was then calculated after excluding uncertain variants. 
Mutational Spectra 
The mutational spectra, defined by the triplets of nucleotides around each mutation  of each 
sample were deconvoluted into mutational processes as previously described48,78. Clonal and 
subclonal variants were separated, as defined above.  Further separation of clonal mutations 
was performed for mutations in genomic regions that had undergone copy number gains. 
These mutations were classified as ‘early’ or ‘late’ depending whether their observed allele 
frequencies were more likely to indicate their presence on 2 or 1 chromosome copies, 
respectively, as assessed by binomial probability. Assignment of mutations to mutational 
signatures was carried out on each subset of mutations (early, late, clonal, subclonal), as well 
as on all mutations from each sample (Supplementary Table 3). 
 Page 38 of 43 
 
Clinical survival analyses 
A Cox regression model was fitted to 71 features: every gene with mutations (breakpoints, 
subs or indels) with a potential functional impact (missense, nonsense, start-lost, inframe, 
frameshift, or occurred in a non-coding transcript) or a CNA highlighted by the copy number 
aberration analysis that occurred in three of more prostatectomy patients. The endpoint was 
biochemical recurrence. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-
Hochberg method. Multivariate analyses were performed on all genes found to be significant 
using discretised Gleason (6, 7, 8 or 9), pathological T-stage (T2, T3) and PSA at 
prostatectomy as cofactors. Gene selection for the optimal predictor of time to biochemical 
recurrence was determined using Lasso79, a shrinkage and selection method for linear 
regression, starting with all genes that had a significant association with time to biochemical 
recurrence. Standard algorithms were used for survival analyses and statistical associations. 
Identifying novel oncogenes 
The joint dataset was compiled from the aggregation of variants called within our samples 
with 3 other datasets, yielding a total of 930 samples, comprised of 710 primary and 220 
metastatic samples: 
 TCGA4, 425 primary cancer samples, whole exome sequencing with SureSelect 
Exome v3 baits on Illumina HiSeq 2000, average coverage ~100X 
 COSMIC database22, 243 samples, curated set of mutations from several sources, 
http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic 
 Stand Up to Cancer23 (SU2C-PCF), 150 metastatic castrate resistant samples, paired-
end, whole exome sequencing with SureSelect Exome v4 baits on Illumina 
HiSeq2000, average coverage ~160X 
 Page 39 of 43 
 
To identify coding and non-coding drivers from SNVs and indels, we used two previously 
described methods50. Coding drivers on the joint dataset (930 cancers) were identified using 
dNdScv, a dN/dS method designed to quantify positive selection in cancer genomes. dNdScv 
models somatic mutations in a given gene as a Poisson process. Inferences on selection are 
carried out separately for missense substitutions, truncating substitutions (nonsense and 
essential splice site mutations) and indels, and then combined into a global P-value per gene. 
Non-coding recurrence was studied using NBR. Both dNdScv and NBR model the variation 
of the mutation rate across the genome using a negative binomial regression with covariates. 
First, Poisson regression is used to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates for the 192 rate 
parameters (rj) describing each of the possible trinucleotide substitutions in a strand-specific 
manner. rj = nj/Lj , where nj is the total number of mutations observed across samples of a 
given trinucleotide class (j) and Lj is the number of available sites for each trinucleotide. 
These rates are used to estimate the total number of mutations across samples expected under 
neutrality in each element considering the mutational signatures active in the cohort and the 
sequence of the elements (Eh = j rjLj,h). This estimate assumes no variation of the mutation 
rate across elements in the genome. Second, a negative binomial regression is used to refine 
this estimate of the background mutation rate of an element, using covariates and Eh as an 
offset. Both methods identify genes or non-coding regions with higher than expected 
mutation recurrence, correcting for gene length, sequence composition, mutation signatures 
acting across patients and for the variation of the mutation rate along the genome. A QQ-plot 
confirmed that P-values obtained from this method in this cohort were not subject to inflation 
and consequent over-calling of driver genes (Supplementary Fig. 6). 
Chromoplexy, characterized by highly clustered genomic breakpoints that occur in chains and 
are sometimes joined by deletion bridges, has been shown to be prevalent in PCa25. To 
identify rearrangement drivers, we first used ChainFinder25 to account for any bias towards 
 Page 40 of 43 
 
regions with chromoplexy and identified ‘unique’ rearranged regions per sample taking the 
mid-point between all the breakpoints ChainFinder assigns to the same chromoplexy event. 
Next, separately aggregating the ICGC samples with and without ERG fusions, we calculated 
inter-breakpoint distance and performed piecewise constant fitting (PCF)75 to identify 
genomic regions which were recurrently rearranged in multiple samples. Rearranged regions 
with potential functional impact were identified using two criteria: a minimum 3-fold 
difference in the number of SVs per MB of ERG+ and ERG- samples; region contains at least 
one gene with multiple samples with truncating events, i.e. homozygous deletion, stop codon, 
frameshift indel or essential splice site mutation. In addition, several identified regions were 
significantly enriched for LOH in either ETS+ or ETS- samples, from copy number analysis 
(see above). The variants identified in key regions are depicted in Fig. 3. 
Chemogenomics annotation of the prostate cancer network 
To construct the network, we used the 71 protein products of the 73 genes identified in this 
study (hereon referred to as Prostate Proteins) to seed a search for all possible interacting 
proteins in the canSAR interactome54. This interactome contains merged and curated data 
from the IMeX consortium80, Phosphosite, (see link below) and other databases. It includes: 
 1) interactions where there were more than two publications reporting experiments 
demonstrating the binary interaction between the two proteins 
2) interactions where there is 3D protein structural evidence of a direct complex 
3) interactions where there are at least two publications reporting that one protein is a 
substrate of the other 
4) interactions where there are at least two papers reporting that one protein is the product of 
a gene under the direct regulatory control of the other 
 Page 41 of 43 
 
It excludes the following: 
A) interactions that were inferred from a large immunoprecipitation experiment without 
follow-up to demonstrate the specific binary interaction 
B) interactions inferred from text mining 
C) interactions inferred from co-occurrence in publications or from gene expression 
correlation. 
The initial prostate cancer seeded network resulted in a large collection of 3290 proteins that 
have some experimental evidence of interacting with at least one Prostate Protein. When we 
added extra proteins into the network, we wanted to ensure that we only add proteins that are 
more likely to function primarily through interaction with the proteins in the network rather 
than just be generic major hubs. To this end, we carried out the following steps: Starting with 
the input (prostate protein) list, we obtained all possible first neighbours. We then computed, 
for each new protein, the proportion of its first neighbours that are in the original input list. 
To define the proteins that are most likely to function through our network, we calculated the 
chances of these proportions occurring in a random network. We did this by randomising our 
interactome 10,000 times and computing how often the observed proportions can be achieved 
by chance (empirical p-value). We corrected the p-values for multiple testing and retained 
only proteins that have corrected FDR p-values less than 0.05. (Supplementary Fig. 5). We 
performed network minimisation to maintain only proteins that are strongly connected to 
more than one Prostate Protein or whose only connection is to one of the Prostate Proteins. 
We identified a Prostate Cancer network of 156 proteins. Using canSAR’s Cancer Protein 
Annotation Tool (CPAT)81, we annotated the 156 proteins with pharmacological and 
druggability data. We labelled proteins that are: 1) targets of approved drugs; 2) targets of 
drugs under clinical investigation, 3) targets of preclinical or discovery stage compounds that 
 Page 42 of 43 
 
are active at concentrations equal to or less than 100 nM against the protein of interest 4) 
proteins that we predict to be druggable using our structural druggability prediction 
protocols81-84 but that have few or no published active inhibitors – these are potential targets 
for future drug discovery.
