IMPORTANCE Optimal timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for severe acute
kidney injury (AKI) but without life-threatening indications is still unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether early initiation of RRT in patients who are critically ill with
AKI reduces 90-day all-cause mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-center randomized clinical trial of 231
critically ill patients with AKI Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2
(�2 times baseline or urinary output <0.5 mL/kg/h for �12 hours) and plasma neutrophil
gelatinase–associated lipocalin level higher than 150 ng/mL enrolled between August 2013
and June 2015 from a university hospital in Germany.
INTERVENTIONS Early (within 8 hours of diagnosis of KDIGO stage 2; n = 112) or delayed
(within 12 hours of stage 3 AKI or no initiation; n = 119) initiation of RRT.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was mortality at 90 days after
randomization. Secondary end points included 28- and 60-day mortality, clinical evidence of
organ dysfunction, recovery of renal function, requirement of RRT after day 90, duration of
renal support, and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay.
RESULTS Among 231 patients (mean age, 67 years; men, 146 [63.2%]), all patients in the early
group (n = 112) and 108 of 119 patients (90.8%) in the delayed group received RRT. All
patients completed follow-up at 90 days. Median time (Q1, Q3) from meeting full eligibility
criteria to RRT initiation was significantly shorter in the early group (6.0 hours [Q1, Q3: 4.0,
7.0]) than in the delayed group (25.5 h [Q1, Q3: 18.8, 40.3]; difference, −21.0 [95% CI, −24.0
to −18.0]; P < .001). Early initiation of RRT significantly reduced 90-day mortality (44 of 112
patients [39.3%]) compared with delayed initiation of RRT (65 of 119 patients [54.7%];
hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.97]; difference, −15.4% [95% CI, −28.1% to −2.6%];
P = .03). More patients in the early group recovered renal function by day 90 (60 of 112
patients [53.6%] in the early group vs 46 of 119 patients [38.7%] in the delayed group; odds
ratio [OR], 0.55 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0. 93]; difference, 14.9% [95% CI, 2.2% to 27.6%]; P = .02).
Duration of RRT and length of hospital stay were significantly shorter in the early group than
in the delayed group (RRT: 9 days [Q1, Q3: 4, 44] in the early group vs 25 days [Q1, Q3: 7, >90]
in the delayed group; P = .04; HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.48 to 1.00]; difference, −18 days [95% CI,
−41 to 4]; hospital stay: 51 days [Q1, Q3: 31, 74] in the early group vs 82 days [Q1, Q3: 67, >90]
in the delayed group; P < .001; HR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.52]; difference, −37 days [95% CI,
−� to −19.5]), but there was no significant effect on requirement of RRT after day 90, organ
dysfunction, and length of ICU stay.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients with AKI, early RRT compared
with delayed initiation of RRT reduced mortality over the first 90 days. Further multicenter
trials of this intervention are warranted.

A
cute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-recognized compli-
cation of critical illness with a large effect on morbid-
ity and mortality.1 Despite increases in our knowledge
of the management of patients who are critically ill, mortality
associated with AKI remains high.2-4 Although renal replace-
ment therapy (RRT) provokes a considerable escalation in the
complexity of treatment,
the optimal timing of ini-
tiation of RRT in critically
ill patients with AKI is still
unknown.5,6Althoughthe
need for RRT in patients
with severe AKI and life-
threatening complica-
tions is unequivocal, the
timing of RRT initiation in patients with severe AKI without
such complications has not yet been defined. Earlier initia-
tion of RRT may produce benefits by avoiding hypervolemia,
eliminating of toxins, establishing acid-base homeostasis, and
preventing other complications attributable to AKI. How-
ever, early initiation of RRT may unnecessarily expose some
patients to potential harm because some patients will spon-
taneously recover renal function.
The optimal timing of RRT initiation has been the focus
of several studies. Current evidence suggests reduced mortal-
ity and better renal recovery with earlier RRT initiation.7-9 A
recently published pilot multicenter randomized trial inves-
tigated the optimal timing of initiation of RRT in critically ill
patients with AKI.10 The authors demonstrated the feasibil-
ity of conducting a large definitive trial comparing 2 strate-
gies for RRT initiation among critically ill patients with AKI.
In this pilot trial, mortality rates were not different between
groups.10 Thus, a large randomized study with a robust and
relevant clinical end point is warranted to resolve this issue.
As an initial step to achieve this goal, a single-center random-
ized clinical trial was performed to investigate whether early
initiation of RRT could reduce 90-day all-cause mortality and
to analyze other relevant clinical outcomes of RRT in criti-
cally ill patients with AKI.
Methods
Study Design and Ethics
A randomized, single-center, 2-group, parallel-group trial of
different RRT-implementation strategies for critically ill pa-
tients with AKI was conducted between August 2013 and July
2015(trialprotocolinSupplement1).Institutionalreviewboard
approval was obtained from the research ethics committee of
the Chamber of Physicians Westfalen-Lippe and the West-
phalian Wilhelms University Muenster and the trial was reg-
isteredintheGermanClinicalTrialsRegister(DRKS00004367).
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
ofHelsinki,October2008(49thGeneralAssemblyoftheWorld
MedicalAssociation).Allconsentproceduresfollowedlocalre-
quirements, as approved by the ethics committee of the Uni-
versity of Muenster. The treating investigator informed the pa-
tient about the nature of the trial, its aims, and expected
advantages, as well as possible risks. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from eligible patients or by their legally au-
thorized representative. Deferred consent was used in emer-
gencies, and a consultant physician independent of the
investigational team gave authorization. Once the partici-
pant regained capacity or the legally authorized representa-
tive was available, the individual was asked to affirm or with-
draw consent.
Patient Recruitment
AKI was diagnosed based on changes in the serum creati-
nine, urine output, or both. Creatinine measurements were
performed twice per day. Every patient had a urinary cath-
eter and urine output was measured every hour. Prior to ran-
domization, investigators obtained consent for participation
in the study. Assuming all inclusion criteria were fulfilled
and no exclusion criteria were met, each patient received a
study identification number and treatment allocation at
enrollment. Inclusion criteria were (1) Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2 (2-fold increase
in serum-creatinine from baseline [for baseline serum
creatinine, we used the serum creatinine at hospital admis-
sion, the last available serum creatinine within the last 3
months, or an estimated serum creatinine as per the KDIGO
guideline5 in patients with no information about their prior
kidney function] or urinary output <0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥12
hours) despite optimal resuscitation (optimizing intravascu-
lar volume [fluid resuscitation: pulmonary artery occlusion
pressure/central venous pressure of >12 mm Hg, stroke vol-
ume variation <12% in ventilated patients]; optimization of
cardiac index [>2.6 L/min/m2]; hemodynamic optimization
[mean arterial pressure >65 mm Hg]; normalizing intra-
abdominal pressure [<15 mm Hg]); (2) plasma neutrophil
gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL) >150 ng/mL; (3) at
least 1 of the following conditions: severe sepsis, use of vaso-
pressors or catecholamines (norepinephrine or epinephrine
>0.1 μg/kg/min), refractory fluid overload (worsening pul-
monary edema, PaO2/FiO2 <300 mm Hg or fluid balance
>10% of body weight), development or progression of nonre-
nal organ dysfunction (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
[SOFA] score ≥2); (4) aged between 18 and 90 years; and
(5) intention to provide full intensive care treatment for at
least 3 days. Patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <30 mL/min),
previous renal replacement therapy, AKI caused by perma-
nent occlusion or surgical lesion of the renal artery, glomeru-
lonephritis, interstitial nephritis, vasculitis, postrenal
obstruction, or hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura were excluded. We also excluded
patients for pregnancy, prior kidney transplantation, hepa-
torenal syndrome, AIDS with a CD4 count of <0.05 × 10 E/L,
hematologic malignancy with neutrophils of <0.05 × 10 E/L,
or participation in another interventional clinical trial.
Randomization and Interventions
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment
groups using a computerized system. Randomization was
stratified by SOFA Cardiovascular score (0-2 vs 3-4) and by the

presence or absence of oliguria. A block randomization within
each stratum with block size of 10 was used. Early RRT was
initiated within 8 hours of diagnosis of stage 2 AKI using the
KDIGO classification (urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥12h or
2-fold increase in serum creatinine compared with baseline).
Delayed RRT was initiated within 12 hours of stage 3 AKI (urine
output <0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥24 h and/or >3 fold increase in se-
rum creatinine level compared with baseline or serum creati-
nine of ≥4 mg/dL with an acute increase of at least 0.5 mg/dL
within 48 hours [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]) or if
any of the following absolute indications for RRT were
present: serum urea level higher than 100 mg/dL; serum po-
tassium level higher than 6 mEq/L and/or with electrocardiog-
raphy abnormalities; serum magnesium level higher than
8 mEq/L (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.5); urine pro-
duction lower than 200 mL per 12 hours or anuria (according
totheKDIGOrecommendations);andorganedemainthepres-
ence of AKI resistant to diuretic treatment (1 attempt with loop
diuretics prior to randomization).
RRT Delivery
Once RRT was initiated, identical settings were used in both
treatment groups according to the KDIGO guidelines. To
ensure uniformity of treatment between early and delayed
RRT groups, specific protocols for the performance of RRT
were strictly adhered to. All patients in both groups were
treated using continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.
Replacement fluid was delivered into extracorporal circuit
before the filter (ie, predilution), with a ratio of dialysate to
replacement fluid of 1:1. The effluent flow prescribed was
based on the patient’
s body weight at the time of random-
ization and was 30 mL/kg/h (additional fluid removal with-
out replacement was not considered part of the prescribed
dose). Blood flow was kept above 110 mL/min. The deliv-
ered dose of RRT was monitored based on bloodside urea
kinetics. Regional anticoagulation with citrate was used to
prevent circuit clotting. RRT was discontinued if renal
recovery defined by urine output (>400 mL/24 h without
and 2100 mL/24 h with diuretic treatment) and creatinine
clearance (>20 mL/min) occurred. If cessation criteria were
not fulfilled after 7 days, continuous renal replacement
therapy could be changed to an intermittent procedure (sus-
tained low-efficiency daily dialysis [SLEDD], slow continu-
ous ultrafiltration or intermittent hemodialysis).
Follow-up
Following randomization, laboratory and physiologic data, se-
verity of illness as measured by the modified SOFA score, and
RRT administration details for 21 days were documented. All
patients were followed up for 90 days to ascertain vital sta-
tus, RRT requirement, and recovery of renal function.
Outcomes
The primary end point was overall mortality in a 90-day
follow-up period (from randomization). Secondary out-
comesincludedoverallmortalityina28-and60-dayfollow-up
period, clinical evidence of organ dysfunction (daily SOFA
scores while in the ICU), recovery of renal function, require-
ment of hemodialysis after day 28 and day 60, duration of re-
nal support, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and markers of
inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, and mac-
rophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]).
Biomarker Assay Methods
Blood samples were collected for measurement of inflamma-
tory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18 and MIF) on the day
of randomization (day 0) and 1 day after randomization (day 1),
centrifuged and frozen immediately at −80°C, and then stored
untilassayed.Allinflammatorymediatorswereanalyzedusing
commercially available assay kits (LEGENDplex; BioLegend).
Sample Size Determination
A group sequential adaptive design with 1 interim analysis
and a global (2-sided) significance level α of .05 was used.
Power calculations were performed based on the primary
end point (ie, the overall mortality in a 90-day follow-up
period). The expected 90-day mortality rate in the control
group with delayed initiation of RRT was 55% based on the
literature.8,11-19 Differences between treatment groups were
to be detected with a power of 80%, if the 90-day mortality
rate with early initiation of RRT was 37% or less. The
expected treatment effect of 18% was calculated on the mor-
tality differences between early and delayed RRT reported in
prior studies.8,11-19 A required sample size for the final analy-
sis was 115 patients per treatment group, 230 patients in
total. One interim analysis was performed after half of the
total number of deaths across both treatment groups. Power
calculations were performed based on a 2-sided inverse nor-
mal log-rank test,20 using ADDPLAN software (ICON).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed according to the prin-
ciples of the International Conference on Harmonisation of
Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals
for Human Use guideline E9 using the SAS software for
Windows (SAS Institute), version 9.4. Descriptive analyses
were performed on all baseline variables including means
and standard deviations, medians and quartiles (quartile 1
[Q1], quartile 3 [Q3]), or frequency and percentages, as
appropriate. The primary efficacy analysis includes all ran-
domized patients (full analysis set) and was performed
according to the intention-to-treat principle (ie, all patients
were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized).
Patients who received RRT were analyzed in the per-
protocol analysis. A group sequential plan according to
O’
Brien and Fleming with 1 interim analysis was established.
To maintain a global significance level α of .05, the interim
and the final analysis were performed on local significance
levels 0.0052 and 0.0480, respectively. Based on the group
sequential plan, in the interim analysis the number of deaths
up to the final analysis was recalculated applying the inverse
normal method.21 The effect of early vs delayed initiation of
RRT on overall mortality in a 90-day follow-up period was
assessed by comparing the randomized groups with a
(2-sided) inverse normal log-rank test.20 The inverse normal
log-rank test is performed by computing P values for the

interim and final log-rank tests separately, and then combin-
ing these P values so that the overall type I error is con-
trolled. The primary intention-to-treat analysis of the pri-
mary outcome provides confirmatory statistical evidence.
The primary statistical analysis was performed first using
a hierarchical testing procedure. After reaching a significant
result in the primary analysis, each of the secondary out-
comes were tested separately using a significance level of .05.
No adjustment for multiplicity was applied across the second-
ary outcomes. Therefore, the results of secondary outcome
analyses do not claim confirmatory statistical evidence. The
evidence level of the results, however, is more than explor-
atory,duetotheprespecificationofsecondaryoutcomesinthe
protocol, as well as the hierarchical ordering (ie, a required sig-
nificant result in the primary statistical analysis before the sec-
ondary outcomes were tested).
Inferential statistical analyses of time-to-event out-
comes that include censored cases were performed using
survival analytic methods, such as Kaplan-Meier estimation
of the survival function and the log-rank test. Proportional
hazards models were fitted after checking the proportional-
ity assumption using the Grambsch and Therneau test, and
hazard ratios (HRs) with associated 95% confidence inter-
vals were calculated.
Binary data were tested for significance using the χ2 test
or Fisher exact test where appropriate. Event rates were com-
pared by calculating the odds ratio [OR] and absolute risk re-
duction with associated asymptotic 95% confidence inter-
vals. Normally distributed data were tested for significance
using t tests. For non-normal data the Mann-Whitney U test
was applied, and median values were compared using the
Hodges-Lehmann estimation of location shift with associ-
ated 95% confidence interval.
All patients completed 90-day follow up (with a toler-
ance of ±14 days) and vital status was determined. Therefore,
in all corresponding statistical analyses (including the pri-
mary analysis) an issue of missing data does not arise. In all
other statistical analyses, very little missing occurred and were
not replaced using any kind of imputation.
Results
Patients
Of 604 patients with AKI screened for the trial, 231 were en-
rolled and randomized to receive either early initiation of RRT
(early group; n = 112) or delayed initiation of RRT (delayed
group; n = 119) and included in the primary analysis (Figure 1).
The baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Baseline
NGAL values were not significantly different between both
groups (Table 1). There were no significant differences regard-
ing the criteria for dialysis initiation between both groups
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
All 112 patients assigned to early group received RRT.
However, for the 119 participants assigned to delayed group,
only 108 received RRT. RRT was not initiated in 11 patients
(9.2%) because 6 patients (5.0%) did not progress to severe
AKI (stage 3), 4 patients had protocol violations (3.4%; the
patients recovered renal function after reaching stage 3 but
without RRT), and 1 patient (0.8%) had no RRT device avail-
able. Consistent with the protocol, absolute indications
occurred in 18 patients in the delayed group (15.1%), 17 of
whom received RRT before reaching KDIGO stage 3 criteria.
At randomization, serum creatinine and urine output were
not significantly different between early and delayed groups
(mean [SD] serum creatinine, 1.95 mg/dL [0.64] for the early
group vs 2.00 mg/dL [1.1] for the delayed group, P = .67;
median [Q1, Q3] urine output, 460 mL/24 h [187.5, 840.0]
for the early group vs 500 mL/24 h [156.3, 1042.0] for the
delayed group, P = .89). The median time from meeting full
eligibility criteria to RRT initiation in the early group (6.0
hours [Q1, Q3: 4.0, 7.0]) was significantly shorter compared
with the delayed group (25.5 hours [Q1, Q3: 18.8, 40.3];
between-group difference, −21.0 [95% CI, −24.0 to −18.0];
P < .001; Table 2). In addition, patients in the delayed group
were analyzed separately. The median time from random-
ization to initiation of RRT was similar in those patients
reaching KDIGO stage 3 compared with the patients devel-
oping an absolute indication (25 hours [Q1, Q3: 19, 40] for
patients reaching KDIGO stage 3 vs 27 hours [Q1, Q3: 14, 41]
for patients with an absolute indication, P = .97). At the time
of RRT initiation, serum creatinine and urea concentrations
were both higher in the delayed group compared with the
early group, whereas urine output was significantly lower in
the delayed group compared with the early group (Table 2).
All other clinical and biochemical parameters were similar
at the time of RRT initiation (Table 2).
Primary Outcome
Early initiation of RRT significantly reduced 90-day mortal-
ity (Figure 2) compared with delayed initiation of RRT (44 of
112 patients [39.3%] in the early group vs 65 of 119 patients
[54.7%] in the delayed group; P = .03; HR, 0.66 [95% CI,
0.45 to 0.97]; between-group difference, −15.4% [95% CI,
−28.1% to −2.6%]) (Table 3). A subgroup analysis of patients
randomized to delayed initiation of RRT found no signifi-
cant difference between those reaching stage 3 and those
developing an absolute indication of RRT for the primary
end point (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Secondary Outcomes
Early initiation of RRT significantly reduced the median
duration of RRT compared with the delayed group (9 days
[Q1, Q3: 4, 44] for the early group vs 25 days [Q1, Q3: 7, >90]
for the delayed group, P = .04; HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.48 to
1.00]; between-group difference, −18 [95% CI, −41 to 4]),
enhanced recovery of renal function at day 90 (60 of 112
patients [53.6%] for the early group vs 46 of 119 patients
[38.7%] for the delayed group, P = .02; OR, 0.55 [95% CI,
0.32 to 0.93]; between-group difference, 14.9% [95% CI,
2.2% to 27.6%]), reduced the median duration of mechani-
cal ventilation (125.5 hours [Q1, Q3: 41, 203] for the early
group vs 181.0 days [Q1, Q3: 65, 413] for the delayed group,
P = .002; between-group difference, −60 [95% CI, −110.0 to
−22.0]), and decreased the length of hospital stay (51 days
[Q1, Q3: 31, 74] for the early group vs 82 days [Q1, Q3: 67,

the 2 groups were seen in the requirement of RRT on day 90
(9 of 67 patients [13.4%] for the early group vs 8 of 53
patients [15.1%] for the delayed group; OR, 0.87 [95% CI,

[Q1, Q3: 12, 36] in the delayed group, P = .33; HR, 0.85 [95%

treatment group comparing those reaching stage 3 vs those de-
velopinganabsoluteindicationforRRTfoundnosignificantdif-
ferences for the secondary end points of duration of RRT, ICU,
and hospital stay (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
There were no significant differences regarding RRT
modalities (blood flow per session, effluent volume per ses-
sion, and session duration) between the groups (eTable 3 in
Supplement 2). Not considering death, 1 serious adverse
event (new-onset arrhythmia) and 84 adverse events among
112 patients in the early group were observed, and no seri-
ous adverse events and 74 adverse events in 108 patients
were observed in the delayed RRT group (eTable 3 in
Supplement 2). RRT-related complications were similar in
both treatment groups (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). In total,
32 of 112 patients (28.6%) in the early group vs 42 of 108
patients (38.9%) in the delayed group were transitioned to
other RRT modalities after receiving continuous RRT: 25 of
112 patients (22.3%) in the early group vs 32 of 108 patients
(29.6%) in the delayed group were transitioned to SLEDD, 2
of 112 patients (1.8%) in the early group vs 2 of 108 patients
(1.9%) in the delayed group were transitioned to intermit-
tent hemodialysis, and 5 of 112 patients (4.5%) in the early
group vs 8 of 108 patients (7.4%) in the delayed group were
transitioned to SLEDD and then to intermittent hemodialy-
sis before being discharged (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).

Daily fluid balance between early and delayed groups did
not differ within the first 3 days after randomization (me-
dian [Q1, Q3]: day one, 2773 mL [702, 5280] for the early
group vs 2207 mL [441, 4167] for the delayed group, P = .15;
day two, 1102 mL [−493, 2789] for the early group vs 1077
mL [−80, 2465] for the delayed group, P = .79; day three,
384 mL [−913, 1847] for the early group vs 209 mL [−933,
1428] for the delayed group, P = .41).
Exploratory Analysis: Inflammatory Mediators
Pro- (MIF, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18) and anti-inflammatory
(IL-10) cytokine concentrations in the blood were measured.
These molecules were selected because they are involved in
inflammation and have been associated with decreased sur-
vival and recovery in prior studies.22-25 At the time of ran-
domization, the plasma concentrations of biomarkers MIF,
IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-18 did not differ between groups
(eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Twenty-four hours after ran-
domization when 100% patients in the early group and
21.8% of patients in the delayed group had received at least
6 hours of RRT, IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were signifi-
cantly reduced in the early group compared with the
delayed group (IL-6: 399.4 pg/mL in the early group vs
989.3 pg/mL in the delayed group; Hodges-Lehmann esti-
mation of location shift, 310.9 [95% CI, 93.3-663.2]; P = .02;
IL-8: 65.7 pg/mL for the early group vs 215.5 pg/mL for the
delayed group; Hodges-Lehmann estimation of location
shift, 105.9 [95% CI, 52.7-160.6]; P = .001), whereas the
plasma concentrations of MIF, IL-10, and IL-18 did not differ
between groups (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Furthermore,
by Cox regression analysis, IL-6 and IL-8 at day 1 were asso-
ciated with mortality (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial of critically ill patients with
AKI, the use of early RRT compared with delayed therapy re-
duced mortality over the first 90 days and reduced duration
of RRT and length of hospital stay.
Three other trials have evaluated outcomes following
early vs delayed initiation of RRT.8-10 In a randomized clini-
cal trial, Bouman and colleagues8 enrolled 106 patients with
AKI and randomized them to early or delayed RRT initia-
tion. Patients in the early group received RRT soon after
meeting criteria for AKI, whereas delayed initiation of RRT
was defined when patients developed hyperkalemia or pul-
monary edema or had plasma urea levels higher than 440
mmol/L. There was no difference in mortality. One impor-
tant limitation of this study was that patients who were
intended to receive RRT early (early group) received RRT
rather late in the course of AKI. Another single-center trial
performed in India enrolled 208 patients with community-
acquired AKI.9 In the early group, RRT was started after
serum creatinine exceeded 7 mg/dL or serum urea exceeded
25 mmol/L regardless of other AKI complications. In the
usual care group, RRT was initiated only in the setting of
refractory hyperkalemia, acidosis, or volume overload or if

uremic symptoms developed. No differences in kidney
recovery or mortality were observed. In line with these
results, a recently published multicenter trial investigating
accelerated vs standard initiation of RRT in 101 critically ill
patients with AKI also demonstrated no mortality difference
between both groups.10 However, this was a feasibility trial,
and the trial was not powered to investigate mortality.
Finally, 1 small randomized clinical trial demonstrated that
early initiation of RRT was associated with a reduced mor-
tality compared with late initiation of RRT.18 In this study,
the authors evaluated the role of early RRT in 28 patients
with AKI following cardiac surgery. Fourteen patients were
started on continuous hemodialysis when their urine vol-
ume decreased to less than 30 mL/h for 3 hours. In patients
in the “late” group (n = 14), RRT was delayed until urine
output had fallen to less than 20 mL/h for 2 hours. Survival
was significantly better in the group of patients who started
RRT earlier. There were no differences between the 2 groups
with respect to age, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and serum creatinine
level at the time of initiation of RRT.
The results of a recently published meta-analysis suggest
that earlier initiation of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI
may have beneficial association with survival (OR, 0.45 [95%
CI, 0.28-0.72]).7 However, this conclusion is based on hetero-
geneous studies of variable quality. Therefore, more random-
ized trials are required to answer this question. This research
priority has been articulated by the KDIGO clinical practice
guidelines,5 and the Acute Kidney Injury Network26 has pri-
oritized this research topic.
Potential benefits of earlier initiation are attributable to
morerapidmetabolicoruremiccontrolandmoreeffectivepre-
vention and management of fluid overload.27 Some data also
suggest that RRT before the onset of severe AKI may attenu-
ate kidney-specific and non–kidney organ injury from acide-
mia, uremia, fluid overload, and systemic inflammation and
could potentially translate into improved survival and earlier
recovery of kidney function.28,29 The counterargument is that
a strategy of early initiation of RRT might subject patients who
would recover renal function with conservative treatment
alone to the potential risks associated with RRT. However, AKI
confers a substantial increased risk of death even in patients
never treated with RRT.30 As such, although there may be a
risk of “unnecessary” RRT, there could be an even greater risk
associatedwithnotprovidingit.Toavoidtreatingpatientswith

system were used in this trial because it has been demon-
strated that plasma NGAL is a good predictor for the need of
RRT in critically ill patients with AKI.31,32 Moreover, NGAL con-
centration can be measured at the bedside within 20 min-
utes, making this biomarker suitable for a trial testing a time-
sensitive intervention. Our data demonstrate that the
combination of the KDIGO classification system in combina-
tion with plasma NGAL can reliably detect patients with pro-
gressively deteriorating AKI. Only 5% (6 of 119 patients) of the
patientsinthedelayedgroupdidnotreceiveRRT,becausethey
spontaneously recovered or died.
Fluid accumulation in patients with AKI is associated
with adverse outcomes.33 However, in our study we could
exclude that fluid accumulation was responsible for a
worse outcome in the delayed group because there were no
differences in daily fluid balance before and within 3 days
after randomization. As some data suggest that initiation of
RRT before the onset of severe AKI may attenuate kidney-
specific and non–kidney organ injury from systemic
inflammation.28,29 It is possible that the reduced plasma lev-
els of inflammatory mediators in the early group are respon-
sible for the reduced mortality. Our data extend the findings

of other studies in which pro-inflammatory cytokines were
associated with poorer outcomes.22,34,35 Increased IL-8 con-
centrations are associated with an increased risk of RRT
dependence and death.36 IL-8, a chemokine, is an important
mediator of innate and adaptive immunity and has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of AKI.37-39 Higher IL-8 con-
centrations may reflect a persistent pro-inflammatory milieu
among renal tubular cells impairing renal recovery. IL-6 is a
pleiotropic cytokine and higher concentrations have been
associated with increased susceptibility to AKI40 and mortal-
ity in patients with AKI.22
As several molecules were associated with adverse out-
comes in our study, immunomodulation strategies that in-
clude inhibition of single molecules are unlikely to be success-
ful,andbroad-spectrummodulationofmultiplemoleculesmay
be needed to improve outcomes in AKI patients.
Study limitations need to be considered. Although a large
mortality difference was detected, this was not a multicenter
trial, and as with many single-center studies, the observed ef-
fect size is likely inflated. Furthermore, larger trials are needed
because small trials cannot avoid small baseline differences.
Another limitation of this study is the limited generalizabil-
ity, because almost all patients recruited were surgical pa-

firm our results and establish the best time point for the ini-
tiation of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI.
Conclusions
Among critically ill patients with AKI, early RRT compared
with delayed initiation of RRT reduced mortality over the
first 90 days. Further multicenter trials of this intervention
are warranted.
