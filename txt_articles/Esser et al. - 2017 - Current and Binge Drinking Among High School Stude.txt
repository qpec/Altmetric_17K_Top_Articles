Excessive drinking accounted for approximately 4,300 deaths 
each year among persons aged <21 years during 2006–2010,* 
and underage drinking cost the United States $24.3 billion in 
2010 (1). CDC analyzed data from the national Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey (YRBS) for the years 1991–2015 to examine 
trends in drinking by U.S. high school students, and from the 
2015 YRBS to assess the usual source of alcohol consumed† 
and binge drinking intensity (i.e., the average number of drinks 
consumed per binge drinking occasion).§ During 1991–2007, 
the prevalence of current drinking¶ among high school stu-
dents declined significantly, from 50.8% (1991) to 44.7% 
(2007), and then significantly declined to 32.8% in 2015. 
The prevalence of binge drinking** increased from 31.3% in 
1991 to 31.5% in 1999, and then significantly declined to 
17.7% in 2015. Most high school students who drank were 
binge drinkers (57.8%), and 43.8% of binge drinkers con-
sumed eight or more drinks in a row. Despite progress, current 
drinking and binge drinking are common among high school 
students, and many students who binge drink do so at high 
intensity (i.e., eight or more drinks in a row). Widespread use 
of evidence-based strategies for preventing excessive drinking 
(e.g., increasing alcohol taxes, regulating alcohol outlet density, 
and having commercial host liability laws) could help reduce 
underage drinking and related harms.††
The national YRBS is a cross-sectional, biennial school-based 
survey of 9th–12th grade students in U.S. public and private 
schools that monitors the prevalence of health risk behaviors. 
During 1991–2015, a three-stage cluster sample design was 
used to select nationally representative samples of students; 
sample sizes ranged from 10,904 to 16,410. During each 
cycle, students completed an anonymous, self-administered 
questionnaire. Response rates ranged from 60% to 71%. Data 
were weighted to account for oversampling of non-Hispanic 
black and Hispanic students and nonresponse, and to produce

national estimates of health risk behaviors among U.S. high 
school students who attend public or private schools. Details 
of the YRBS methodology have been published previously.§§
Current drinking was defined as consuming one or more 
alcoholic drink on ≥1 days during the past 30 days. Binge 
drinking was defined as consuming five or more alcoholic 
drinks in a row on ≥1 days during the past 30 days. The 
usual source of alcohol and binge drinking intensity also were 
assessed. The prevalence of current drinking was calculated 
among students overall. The prevalence of binge drinking 
was calculated among students overall and current drinkers. 
The usual source of alcohol and binge drinking intensity were 
calculated among current drinkers only.
Data from 1991–2015 were used to examine trends in 
current drinking, binge drinking, and binge drinking among 
current drinkers, adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, and grade. 
Trends were analyzed using logistic regression models and 
interaction terms. Time was modeled as a continuous variable¶¶ 
with linear and nonlinear (quadratic) components, which were 
considered significant at p-values <0.05. Joinpoint software*** 
was used, when significant quadratic trends were found, to 
determine the year in which the trend changed direction or lev-
eled off. Percentage-point changes were calculated to compare 
the magnitude of trends, but differences between subgroups 
were not tested for significance. Data from 2015 were used 
to assess the prevalence of drinking patterns overall and by 
sociodemographic characteristics, using pairwise t-tests to 
assess differences by subgroup. Respondents who had missing 
information were excluded from analyses.††† The sample sizes 
presented are unweighted and the percentages are weighted.
The overall prevalence of current drinking among U.S. high 
school students declined significantly from 50.8% in 1991 
to 44.7% in 2007, then further declined to 32.8% in 2015 
(Figure 1). Trend analysis indicated that the prevalence of binge 
drinking increased from 31.3% in 1991 to 31.5% in 1999, 
then declined significantly to 17.7% in 2015. From 1991 to 
2015, the percentage-point decline in the prevalence of current

Among all students, the percentage missing for current drinking was 9.7%, 
and for binge drinking was 4.2%.

and binge drinking was greater among male students (current 
drinking declined 20.5 percentage points, and binge drinking 
declined 17.9 percentage points) than female students (current 
drinking declined 15.3 percentage points, and binge drinking 
declined 9.1 percentage points).
The prevalence of binge drinking among current drink-
ers increased significantly from 62.2% in 1991 to 66.6% in 
1997, then declined significantly to 57.8% in 2015 (Figure 2). 
Among male current drinkers, the prevalence of binge drink-
ing declined significantly from 69.9% in 1991 to 61.5% in 
2015. Among female current drinkers, the prevalence of binge 
drinking increased from 53.5% in 1991 to 60.4% in 1997, 
then declined to 54.0% in 2015.
In 2015, the prevalence of current drinking increased signifi-
cantly with school grade from 23.4% among 9th grade students 
to 42.4% among 12th grade students, as did the prevalence of 
binge drinking, which was 10.4% among 9th grade students 
and 24.6% among 12th grade students (Table). Similarly, the 
prevalence of binge drinking among current drinkers increased 
significantly with school grade from 47.0% (9th grade stu-
dents) to 61.9% (12th grade students). The prevalence of 
current and binge drinking was significantly higher among 
non-Hispanic white and Hispanic students than among non-
Hispanic black students. The prevalence of binge drinking 
among current drinkers was also significantly higher among 
non-Hispanic white than among non-Hispanic black students.
In 2015, 36.4% of binge drinkers and 55.7% of current 
drinkers who did not binge drink usually obtained alcohol 
from someone who gave it to them. Binge drinkers were more 
than three times more likely than current drinkers who did 
not binge drink to give someone money to purchase alcohol 
(30.7% compared with 8.8%) and to purchase alcohol them-
selves (8.8% compared with 2.8%). Among binge drinkers, 
43.8% consumed eight or more drinks in a row. Among binge 
drinkers, the prevalence of consuming eight or more drinks 
in a row was significantly higher among male (50.5%) than 
female (35.3%) students.

Discussion
Overall, current and binge drinking declined significantly 
among U.S. high school students from 1991 to 2015.§§§ The 
percentage-point decrease was greater among male than female 
students, and the prevalence of current and binge drinking 
among male and female students converged in recent years. 
However, approximately one in three high school students 
still drank alcohol and one in six were binge drinkers in 2015. 
Most high school students who drank were also binge drinkers, 
and in 2015, more than two in five binge drinkers consumed 
eight or more drinks in a row, increasing the risk for alcohol-
attributable harms (e.g., violence, unintentional injuries, and 
alcohol poisoning). High school students who drank usually 
obtained alcohol from others, but binge drinkers were three 
times more likely than current drinkers who did not binge 
drink to give others money to purchase alcohol for them.
Other national surveys have also reported declines in cur-
rent and binge drinking among high school–aged students 
since the 1990s, although specific prevalence estimates vary 
(2,3). The decline in underage drinking might be related to 
increased implementation of state underage drinking policies 
(4). Previous studies have also shown that the age 21 minimum 
legal drinking age was associated with reduced youth drink-
ing (5) and reduced alcohol-attributable harms (e.g., motor 
vehicle crashes).¶¶¶ However, enforcement of this law varies 
across jurisdictions (6).
The finding that high school students who drink usually 
obtain alcohol from others, potentially including parents and 
guardians, is consistent with the state-specific relationship 
between youth and adult drinking (7). Policies affecting adults’ 
alcohol consumption have also been shown to reduce youth alco-
hol consumption significantly, and alcohol policies affecting the 
price and availability of alcohol consumption have been found 
to have the greatest impact on binge drinking by adults (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, YRBS data were only collected among teens who 
attended school, and therefore are not representative of all 
teens. Nationwide, in 2012, approximately 3% of persons 
aged 16–17 years were not enrolled in high school and had 
not completed high school.**** Second, YRBS data are self-
reported, and alcohol consumption might not be accurately 
reported because of recall and social desirability biases. Third, 
the 1991–2015 YRBS period defines binge drinking for males 
 §§§ The minimum legal drinking age of 21 years was implemented by all states 
by 1988.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Each year from 2006 to 2010, excessive alcohol consumption 
was responsible for approximately 4,300 deaths among persons 
aged <21 years, and, in 2010, underage drinking cost the United 
States $24.3 billion.
What is added by this report?
The overall prevalence of current drinking among U.S. high 
school students declined significantly from 50.8% in 1991 to 
44.7% in 2007, then further declined to 32.8% in 2015. The 
prevalence of binge drinking increased from 31.3% in 1991 to 
31.5% in 1999, then declined significantly to 17.7% in 2015. 
However, in 2015, approximately one in three high school 
students drank alcohol during the past 30 days and one in six 
were binge drinkers. Most high school students who drank 
(57.8%) were also binge drinkers, and more than two in five 
binge drinkers consumed eight or more drinks in a row.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Despite progress, current and binge drinking remain common 
among high school students, and many students who binge 
drink do so at high intensity (i.e., eight or more drinks in a row). 
Widespread use of evidence-based prevention strategies for 
excessive drinking (e.g., increasing alcohol taxes, regulating 
alcohol outlet density, and having commercial host liability 
laws) could help reduce underage drinking and related harms.
and females as five or more drinks in a row, and the prevalence 
of binge drinking among females would likely be higher if it 
were assessed using a sex-specific, four-drink threshold (9). 
Fourth, data were not available to assess drinking by other 
racial/ethnic populations. Finally, it was not possible to evaluate 
reasons for the observed declines in current and binge drinking 
using YRBS data.
The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends 
evidence-based strategies for reducing excessive alcohol use, 
including underage and binge drinking. These include increas-
ing alcohol taxes, regulating alcohol outlet density, and having 
commercial host liability laws. Moreover, given the association 
between youth exposure to alcohol advertising and underage 
drinking, monitoring and reducing youth exposure to alcohol 
advertising through the implementation of “no-buy” lists (i.e., 
lists of television programming that risk overexposing youth 
to alcohol advertising based on the industry’s self-regulatory 
alcohol marketing guidelines) might also help reduce under-
age drinking (10).
