Aim: Glioblastoma multiforme is a devastating disease with no curative options due 
to the difficulty in achieving sufficient quantities of effective chemotherapies into the 
tumor past the blood–brain barrier. Micelles loaded with temozolomide (TMZ) were 
designed to increase the delivery of this drug into the brain. Materials & methods: pH-
responsive micelles composed of distearoyl phosphoethanolamine-PEG-2000-amine 
and N-palmitoyl homocysteine were surface-functionalized with PDGF peptide and 
Dylight 680 fluorophore. Results & conclusion: PDGF-micelles containing TMZ have 
specific uptake and increased killing in glial cells compared with untargeted micelles. 
In vivo studies demonstrated selective accumulation of PDGF-micelles containing TMZ 
in orthotopic gliomas implanted in mice. Targeted micelle-based drug carrier systems 
hold potential for delivery of a wide variety of hydrophobic drugs thereby reducing 
its systemic toxicity.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) occurs in 
2–3 people per 100,000 [1]. This relatively 
rare tumor of the brain has a significant over-
all mortality due to its refractory response 
to treatment. The standard of care therapy 
for GBMs is maximal safe surgical resection, 
radiation therapy and concurrent chemother-
apy with temozolomide (TMZ). However, 
even with temozolomide therapy, GBMs have 
a dismal prognosis with a median survival of 
only 14 months [1]. Challenges to offering 
curative therapy to patients with GBMs are 
multifocal: surgery is unable to remove 100% 
of the tumor [2], radiation is able to temporar-
ily halt the growth of a GBM, but is unable to 
eradicate GBMs [3], and chemotherapy deliv-
ery is limited by systemic toxicity [4], thereby 
reducing the amount of active drug that can 
be delivered past the blood–brain barrier 
(BBB) into the tumor.
The standard of care chemotherapy, TMZ, 
is a second-generation imidazotetrazine pro-
drug that is converted by pH changes in the 
cytoplasm of cells to the active alkylating 
agent 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-
4-carboxamide [5,6]. This drug has been used 
for decades in the treatment of GBM, but 
is unable to achieve a cure for patients with 
GBMs in spite of activity in mouse mod-
els [7]. At standard of care dosages, hemato-
logic toxicity in those animals administered 
TMZ is dose limiting [8]. This implies that, 
in spite of its bioavailability and ability to 
cross the BBB, an increased intratumoral 
concentration of TMZ could be beneficial in 
treatment of GBMs.
Delivery of chemotherapy to tumors 
while reducing systemic toxicity has become 
more feasible as technology improves in the 
development of nanoparticles [9]. Polymeric 
micelles have been developed for delivery 
of chemotherapy into tumors [10,11] because 
they are stable nanoparticles that can release 
their contents under specific environmental

circumstances (e.g., a change in pH can trigger the 
release of micellar chemotherapy). In addition, these 
polymeric micelles can be designed with targeting to 
tumor cells in mind [12]. This can decrease systemic 
toxicity while increasing the local concentration of 
chemotherapy into the desired tissues.
As is common in breast cancer and other cancer 
cells, GBMs have specific cell surface receptors that are 
frequently overexpressed, and there is an expanding 
field of targeted biomarkers available for GBMs. GBM 
targets that have been utilized in development of poly-
meric micelles include EGF receptor (EGFR), transfer-

PDGFR-targeted temozolomide micelles to treat tumors    Research Article
rin receptor (TfR), aminopeptidase N and some inte-
grins [13]. This expanding field of discovery can allow 
for better inclusion of a range of GBM tumor markers 
in the targeting of micelle delivered chemotherapies. 
Ultimately, this will allow chemotherapies to be tar-
geted to specific tumor markers in each GBM, allow-
ing for truly personalized therapy with minimization 
of systemic toxicity.
EGFR has been used as a tumor marker for 
GBMs [14], and is used for targeting of micelles, as 
above. However, it is present in only certain subtypes of 
GBMs. Specifically, it is present in classical-like GBMs, 
though it is not present in proneural-like GBMs. This 
relationship is therapeutically relevant when designing 
therapies and targeted micelle therapies. Proneural-like 
GBMs have an increase in PDGF receptors (PGDFRs)

on their cell surfaces [15]. In fact, PDGFR is noted 
on more than 50% of analyzed GBMs [15] and is also 
noted as a cell surface receptor in oligodendrogliomas 
and diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas [16]. Given this 
frequent upregulation of PDGR in GBMs and other 
gliomas, PDGFR is an appropriate target for micelle 
delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into GBMs in the 
human brain.
Here, we improve upon previous micelle composi-
tions in a number of ways to create an efficient and 
effective nanocarrier. First, we conjugate the micelle 
with a novel moiety against an overexpressed cell surface 
receptor, PDGR. TMZ-loaded micelles are targeted 
to GBM cells for increased uptake. Second, we incor-
porate a biocompatible coating to reduce cytotoxicity 
and improve circulation. Micelles loaded with TMZ 
are utilized for increased permeation across the BBB, 
due to the smaller size of the lipid structure. Finally, 
we add a triggered-release (i.e., pH) mechanism of the 
carrier for drug release in a localized environment. The 
pH-dependent release of TMZ from the micelles thus 
occurs preferentially within the GBM cells, thereby 
reducing the risks of systemic toxicity when adminis-
tered in vivo. Taken in combination, these modifica-
tions increase the concentration of TMZ released into 
GBM tumor cells while simultaneously decreasing the 
risks of systemic toxicity.
Materials & methods
Synthesis of micelle-encapsulated TMZ
Micelle encapsulation of TMZ (MTMZ) was car-
ried out as described by Dubertret et al. [17]. Dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to TMZ and sonicated 
for 30 min in a water bath at room temperature. The 
TMZ was then mixed with amino-PEG-PE (1,2-dia-
cyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino-
poly(ethylene glycol)]; 870320P; Avanti Polar Lipids, 
AL, USA) and 0.5 mg of PHC (N-palmitoyl homocys-
teine [ammonium salt]); 880128P; Avanti Polar Lip-
ids, AL, USA) and suspended in chloroform. The sol-
vent was evaporated in a vacuum oven for 1 h at room 
temperature. The pellet obtained after evaporation was 
heated to 80°C and dissolved in nanopure water (18 
mΩ) to produce amine functionalized micelles. The 
micelle solution was sonicated for 1 h in a water bath 
and subsequently filtered using a 0.2 μm syringe filter 
to remove aggregates. For the synthesis of PDGFR-
targeted MTMZ (PMTMZ), MTMZ solution was 
used for peptide conjugation (1:1 ratio of carboxyl 
group on peptide to amine group on the micelles at 
30% coverage of amines). The PDGF peptide (PDG-
Fpep) sequence was yITLPPPRPFFK (Peptide Interna-
tional, KY, USA) [18]. After 15 min of incubation at 
room temperature, phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 
pH ∼12) was added to bring the pH back to 7.5. PDGF 
peptide solution was added to the micelle solution and 
left incubating for 2 h at room temperature. After 2 h, 
excess peptide was purified using 10K MWCO ultra-
centrifugal device (EMD Millipore, MA, USA) at least 
three-times at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. For dye 
labeling, MTMZ and PMTMZ solution was added to 
NHS Dylight 680 (ratio of covering 30% amines on 
the micelles, Thermo Scientific, IL, USA), respectively. 
PBS buffer (pH 7.2) was added to the solution. The 
solution was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 
After 1 h, excess dye was purified using 10K MWCO 
ultracentrifugal device three-times.
Characterization of micelle-encapsulated TMZ
The concentrations of MTMZ and PMTMZ were 
determined by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption 
using a Biotek microplate spectrophotometer (Win-
ooski, VT, USA). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) anal-
ysis and zeta potential analysis of MTMZ and PMTMZ 
in aqueous solution was performed on a ZetaPALS par-
ticle analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments, NY, USA). 
PBS (pH 7.2) was used as the starting solvent. The 
respective aqueous master solution was diluted fivefold 
and sonicated for 1 h to prevent aggregation. The solu-
tion was filtered using a 0.2 μm syringe filter before tak-
ing the measurements. Zeta (ξ) potential was automati-
cally calculated from electrophoretic mobility based on 
the Smoluchowski equation, v=(eE/η)ξ, where v is the 
measured electrophoretic velocity, η is the viscosity, e is 
the electrical permittivity of the electrolytic solution and 
E is the electric field.
Negative-stain transmission electron micrographs 
(TEM) of MTMZ and PMTMZ were taken by spread-

ing 10 μl of MTMZ or PMTMZ solution (∼1 μM) 
on a carbon-coated copper grid. Excess solution was 
removed with filter paper after 10 min, followed by the 
addition of 10 μl of saturated uranyl acetate solution 
(2% w/v). After another 10 min, the excess stain was 
removed with filter paper. The sample was visualized 
with a JEOL 200CX transmission electron microscope 
(JEOL, MA, USA) at 80 kV equipped with a digital 
camera.
For pH change experiments, PBS buffers of pH 
4–10 were prepared. The pH of PBS buffer (pH 7.2) 
was changed to alternate pHs (pH 4-10) by adding 
sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to assess the 
stability of the micelle at various pHs, thereby keep-
ing the salt concentration in the PBS constant. 5 μl of 
MTMZ or PMTMZ (∼10–4 M) were placed in a 96 
well plate. 200 μl of the respective PBS buffers were 
added to a well. The wells were incubated for 4 h. After 
4 h, UV-Vis measurements were recorded at 325 nm 
(TMZ excitation).
In vitro treatment of micelle encapsulated TMZ
Two types of GBM cell lines are used in this work, U87 
and LN229 (ATCC, VA, USA). These are the most 
commonly used glioma cell lines in research studies. 
U87 is a primary human GBM cell line with an epi-
thelial morphology which was acquired from a stage 
IV 44-year-old cancer patient [19]. LN229 is another 
human GBM cell line derived from brain/right frontal 
parieto-occipital cortex of a 60-year old female GBM 
patient with similar epithelial morphology [20]. LN229 
or U87 cells were plated on a 25 × 25 mm coverslip at 
a density of 30,000 cells per coverslip and maintained 
overnight in cDMEM at 37°C in an incubator sup-
plied with 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours after plating, 
cells were treated with increasing TMZ concentra-
tions of MTMZ and PMTMZ with a final volume of 
300 μl for a total of 4 h. Immunostaining was done 
to observe the co-localization of the drug and recep-
tors. After treatment, the cells were washed with media 
and then fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde for 10 min 
followed by three washes with PBS buffer. The fixed 
cells were blocked with 3% goat serum for 1 h. Fol-
lowing blocking, the cells were incubated with primary 
anti-PDGFR (1:500; sc-432; Santa Cruz Biotech, TX, 
USA) for 2 h. The cells were washed with PBS buffer 
followed by incubation with secondary goat antirab-
bit Alexa 488 antibody (1:1000; A11034; Life Tech-
nologies, NY, USA). For staining of nuclei, cells were 
incubated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) 
(1:7500). The uptake and co-localization of particles 
was visualized by fluorescence microscope using a 
Leica DM 4000B microscope (Leica Microsystems, 
IL, USA). The images were analyzed using ImageJ 
(NIH) software for relative normalized intensities for 
comparison analysis.
The prior experimental protocol was then replicated 
in a longitudinal study using MTMZ and PMTMZ 
at concentrations of 0.5 μM or 1 μM. Cells plated 
on coverslips were incubated with either MTMZ or 
PMTMZ over increasing time. Coverslips were fixed 
with paraformaldehyde at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min after 
incubation for short-term observation and at 4, 8, 16 
and 24 h for long-term examination. The uptake and 
co-localization of particles was visualized by fluores-
cence microscope using a Leica DM 4000B micro-
scope (Leica Microsystems). The images were analyzed 
using ImageJ (NIH) software for relative normalized 
intensities for comparison analysis.
Cytotoxicity of TMZ micelles
Three cytotoxicity experiments, using Guava Via-
Count Assay and flow cytometry (EMD Millipore, 
MA, USA), were performed using increasing con-
centrations of free TMZ, MTMZ and PMTMZ over 
increasing time. Cells (30,000 cells per well) were 
plated in 24-well plates and incubated overnight at 
37°C with 5% CO2. A TMZ solution (1 mg ml-1) in 
DMSO was prepared and stored at 4°C. The stock 
solution was diluted with alpha-MEM and used to 
prepare free TMZ at increasing concentrations of 
0–100 μM. Independently, both 1 μM and 10 μM 
samples of PMTMZ and MTMZ were prepared with 
alpha-MEM. The triplicate wells were treated with 
concentrations at a constant volume of 200 μl per 
well. After 24 h, cell viability was performed using 
Guava ViaCount Assay and flow cytometry (EMD 
Millipore). The remaining wells were retreated with 
the appropriate concentrations over a 10 days period. 
Viability data were collected and analyzed.
Inhibition of receptor cycling using brefeldin A 
in vitro
U87 cells were plated on 25 × 25 mm coverslips at a 
density of 30,000 cells per coverslip and maintained 
overnight in media at 37°C in an incubator supplied 
with 5% CO2. Twenty four hours after plating, one set 
of cells were treated with 250 μl of brefeldin A (BA) 
solution (10 μg ml-1 in media) and were incubated for 
1 h (+BA). Another set of coverslips was left with 250 μl 
of media as -BA controls. For the +BA set of cells, the 
BA solution in media was replaced with 250 μl of 500 
nM MTMZ or PMTMZ solutions. The -BA cells were 
treated with 250 μl of 500 nM MTMZ or PMTMZ 
solutions. Both set of cells were incubated with the NPs 
for 0.5, 1, 4 and 6 h, respectively. After treatment, the 
cells were washed with media and then fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by three washes

Figure 2. Concentration-based and kinetic internalization and accumulation of micelle-encapsulated 
temozolomide and PDGF-micelles containing temozolomide into U87 cells (please see facing page). (A) Confocal 
microscopic imaging was performed to assess the uptake of both MTMZ and PMTMZ by glioma cells (U87). U87 
cells were incubated with either MTMZ or PMTMZ (0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 μM). MTMZ and PMTMZ (red) were taken 
up in a concentration-dependent fashion. PMTMZ (red) accumulates in PDGFR-positive (green) U87 cells. PMTMZ 
appeared to internalize more rapidly than MTMZ and were present at higher levels at all the concentrations. 
(B) To evaluate kinetic-based uptake of MTMZ and PMTMZ, mean fluorescence imaging of internalized micelles 
at 0.5 or 1 μM at 0–1, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h was performed. Targeted-TMZ (0.5 or 1 μM) shows a significant increase 
in fluorescence intensity when compared with the same concentration of untargeted-TMZ. Experiments were 
conducted three-times in triplicate. Error bars represent standard deviation.

Orthotopic tumor implantation
For orthotopic brain tumor implants, athymic nude 
mice (NCR Nu;Nu; Charles River Laboratory, MD, 
USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 
50 mg kg-1 bodyweight ketamine/xylazine and fitted 
into a stereotaxic rodent frame (David Kopf Instru-
ments, CA, USA). A small incision was made just 
lateral left to midline to expose the bregma suture. A 
small (1.0 mm) burr hole was drilled at AP = +1, ML 
= -2.5 from bregma. Glioblastoma cells (U87, 300,000 
cells in 3 μl) were slowly deposited at a rate of 1 μl 
per minute in the left striatum at a depth of –3 mm 
from dura with a 10 μl Hamilton syringe (26G blunt 
needle, Fisher Scientific, PA, USA). The needle was 
slowly withdrawn and the incision was closed with 
2–3 sutures. The tumors developed for 9 days prior 
to tail vein injection. Tumor burden and location was 
evaluated using luciferase activity. At 9 days, lucif-
erin (150 μg ml-1; substrate for luciferase) was injected 
within the peritoneal cavity. Luminescence measure-
ments were taken using an IVIS 200 imager (Perki-
nElmer, MA, USA). Animals were fed exclusively on 
a special rodent diet (Tekland 2018S; Harlan Labora-
tories, Inc., IN, USA) to reduce autofluorescence. Ani-
mal experiments were performed according to policies 
and guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee (IACUC) at Medical University of 
South Carolina under approved protocols.
In vivo fluorescence imaging
Mice with orthotopic tumors were anesthetized with 
isoflurane and injected intravenously via the tail with 
either PMTMZ or MTMZ at a dosage of 0.001 mg kg-
1 of TMZ per total mouse body weight. Mice were 
imaged at 0, 1, 4, 6 and 24 h. After live imaging, the 
mice were euthanized and excised organs were imaged 
after necropsy. Fluorescent multispectral images were 
obtained using the Maestro In Vivo Imaging Sys-
tem (PerkinElmer, MA, USA). Multispectral in vivo 
images were acquired under a constant exposure 
of 2000 ms with an orange filter acquisition setting 
of 630–850 nm in 2 nm increments. Multispectral 
images were unmixed into their component spectra 
(Dylight 680, autofluorescence, and background) and 
these component images were used to gain quantita-
tive information in terms of average fluorescence inten-
sity by creating regions of interest (ROIs) around the 
organs in the Dylight 680 component images.
Results
Micelles composed of PEG-PE amine (1,2-dis-
tearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-
[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000 and PHC (N-pal-
mitoyl homocysteine (ammonium salt)) were prepared 
to encapsulate hydrophobic TMZ (Figure 1A). PHC, a 
pH sensitive lipid [21] was used to assist in the micelle 
rupture at acidic pH to ensure the delivery of the cargo 
inside the micelle core. Amine functionality on PEG-
PE amine was utilized for further tailoring of the micelle 
with targeting peptides (PDGF, yITLPPPRPFFK) 
containing a carboxyl group and labeling with fluo-
rescent dyes (Dylight 680) for tracking the micelle in 
in vitro cellular uptake studies.
Untargeted, micelle-encapsulated TMZ (MTMZ) 
and PDGFR-targeted TMZ (PMTMZ) were char-
acterized by DLS, UV-Vis spectroscopy and micelle 
integrity in physiological buffer. The UV-Vis spectra 
of MTMZ and PMTMZ showed peaks from TMZ 
(325 nm) and the fluorophore (680 nm) demonstrat-
ing the presence of hydrophobic TMZ inside the core 
and the fluorescent label on the exterior of the micelles 
(Figure 1B). DLS data showed both MTMZ and 
PMTMZ have an average hydrodynamic diameter of 
around 10 ± 1.2 and 12 ± 2.3 nm, respectively, with a 
polydispersity index of 0.1 and 0.2% (Figure 1C). The 
size distribution is determined by the polydispersity 
index. The lower the value is, the narrower the size dis-
tribution or the more uniform the nanoparticle sam-
ple. However, attachment of PDGF increased the poly-
dispersity index due to the steric hindrance caused by

the cyclic structure of PDGF. The DLS size distribu-
tion is identical to the instrumental response function 
corresponding to a monodispersed sample, indicating 
that aggregation is negligible [22]. Zeta potential is an 
indicator of surface charge, which determines particle 
stability in dispersion. Zeta potentials of MTMZ and 
PMTMZ were -40.35 ± 4.46 and -45.18 ± 3.71 mV, 
respectively, as shown in Table 1. The micelles in the 
present study were found stable in the dispersion state, 
possessing high absolute values of zeta potential and 
having negative surface charges. Particle surface conju-
gation slightly increased the absolute value of the zeta 
potential.
Stability and rupture efficiency of the micelles were 
evaluated using a pH change assay (Figure 1E). The pH 
change studies were performed to evaluate the range at 
which the micelle would rupture. This is particularly 
important, as the micelles were engineered to be taken 
up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The micelles 
would need to rupture at an endosomal of pH approxi-
mately 5.5 in order to deliver the encapsulated TMZ 
cargo. These studies illustrated that for both MTMZ 
and PMTMZ increased absorbance intensity at 325 
nm was seen between pH 6 and 7 indicated that the 
micelles were intact, holding the hydrophobic TMZ 
inside its core. Upon decreasing the pH from 7 to 4 
(acidic milieu), the intensity was reduced by approxi-
mately 34% for MTMZ and 40% for PMTMZ. Upon 
increasing the pH from 7 to 9 (basic milieu), the inten-
sity declined by approximately 33% for both MTMZ 
and PMTMZ. This depletion of intensity is attributed 
to the loss of micelle membrane integrity, which is due 
to the pH-responsive lipid composition. TMZ was 
able to leach out of the micelle and then aggregated 
within the aqueous solution. TMZ was removed from 
the optical path of the excitation wavelength. This 
demonstrates the functional capability of the micelle 
to release the TMZ at an acidic pH that mimics the 
endosomal pH.
Stability of the MTMZ and PMTMZ was assessed 
over a 24 h period. To mimic the physiologic envi-
ronment, the micelles were suspended in saline (PBS, 
pH 7.2) and absorbance of the drug was examined 
(Figure 1E). Both carriers were relatively stable over 
the 24 h since the change in absorbance of the drug 
was negligible. The slight increase in absorbance for 
MTMZ can be attributed to instrumental error. In 
addition, the stability of these micelles was also evalu-
ated in serum since the presence of lipids, amino acids 
and proteins in the serum could aid to micelle insta-
bility (Figure 1F). The micelles were slightly less stable 
than those suspended in saline over the same period 
with overall loss of absorbance at 325 nm of approxi-
mately 5–7%. These micelle stability experiments 
established the robust nature of the micelles for poten-
tial use in in vivo studies. The self-assembly of the 
two lipids and structural integrity of the micelles were 
examined using electron microscopy (Figure 1G). TEM 
reveals the presence of spherical micelles for PMTMZ 
with a diameter of approximately 12–13 nm.
Micelles were functionalized with a PDGF pep-
tide (PDGFpep) to target the PDGFR expressed on the 
glioma cell surfaces to facilitate targeting and cellular 
uptake. A schematic for the final structure of PMTMZ 
is shown in Figure 1A. Theoretical calculations predict 
that there are 242 PDGF peptides per micelle. Calcu-
lations were made as follows: assuming the micelle is 
a sphere of 10 nm, the surface area (SA) of the sphere 
was calculated first. Then the total number of lipid 
molecules in one micelle was calculated by dividing 
the SA of the lipid molecules by the total SA. Using 
the molar ratio of the lipids used, the number of PEG-
PE amine molecules was calculated, which is equiva-
lent to number of PDGF peptides (assuming 100% 
coupling). Accumulation of the micelles after target-
ing with the PDGFpep was assessed in vitro utilizing 
immunofluorescence (Figure 2). U87 cells that overex-
press the PDGFR (Figure 2A, inset left) were treated 
with increasing concentrations of either PMTMZ 
(targeted) or MTMZ (untargeted) for 4 h at 37°C. 
PMTMZ was internalized in PDGFR-expressing U87 
cells with as little as 0.01 μM micelles, indicating the 
threshold concentration for uptake (Figure 2A, graph). 
At 0.5 μM, significant uptake was observed suggesting 
receptor-mediated endocytosis. The uptake was quan-
tified and the relative intensity graph demonstrated 
that PMTMZ uptake is threefold higher than that of 
MTMZ at 0.1 μM and sixfold higher at 0.5 μM. The 
targeted micelles (red) co-localized with the recep-
tor (green) with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 
0.83 (Figure 2A, inset right). In contrast, few untar-
geted micelles were taken up during treatment with 
increasing concentrations and did not co-localize with 
the receptors (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.32). 
A longitudinal study was performed to demonstrate 
uptake of PMTMZ and MTMZ over a total period of 
24 h (Figure 2B). Overall, PMTMZ uptake for 0.5 μM 
or 1 μM was consistently higher than MTMZ at every 
time point (1, 4, 8, 16, 24 h). A significant increase 
was first observed within 30 min to 1 h after treatment 
was initiated (Figure 2B, inset). After 24 h, PMTMZ 
uptake at 0.5 μM was significantly higher (166%) as 
compared with MTMZ uptake.
To demonstrate that uptake of PMTMZ was pre-
dominantly due to endocytosis associated with the 
PDGF peptide and not diffusion of the micelles, U87 
were treated with brefeldin A (BA), a fungal metabo-
lite that reversibly interferes with intracellular trans-

reduced internalization of PMTMZ. For MTMZ in the presence of BA, the decrease in fluorescence was minimal.

port and receptor cycling and examined for uptake 
(Figure 3). BA acts by inducing major structural changes 
in the morphology of endosomes, the trans-Golgi net-
work, and lysosomes by causing the formation of an 
extensive tubular network and preventing new endo-
some formation [23]. As seen previously in Figure 2, 
significant fluorescence was observed when U87 were 
incubated with PMTMZ (-BA, 15.8% increase) over 
a 6 h period. Fluorescence intensity increased by only 
5.06% when U87 were treated with MTMZ (-BA). 
Preincubation with BA (+BA) decreased the relative 
fluorescence intensity of PMTMZ incubated cells by 
78.2% over time. MTMZ uptake was inhibited to a 
much lesser extent with BA (8.2%).
PMTMZ was first evaluated for cell killing effi-
cacy using a short-term cell viability assay (Figure 4A). 
Glioma cells (U87) were treated with PMTMZ or 
MTMZ (10 μM each) or free TMZ (10 or 100 μM 
each) over the course of 24–72 h with treatments 
added to fresh media once a day. PMTMZ results 
were compared directly to either free TMZ or MTMZ 
measurements. After only 24 h, both PMTMZ and 
MTMZ began to exhibit more killing (∼30%) than 
that of equal or increased concentrations of free TMZ. 
By 72 h, there was a significant difference in the kill-
ing between treatment groups; with PMTMZ killing 
approximately 84% more cells than 10 or 100 μM of 
free TMZ; and MTMZ killing approximately 61% 
more cells than either treatment concentration of free 
TMZ. Overall, between 24 and 72 h, PMTMZ exhib-
ited compelling cell death of approximately 78% with 
MTMZ following at compelling 44%. In comparison, 
free TMZ (10 or 100 μM) only illustrated a cell death 
of compelling 2%.
PMTMZ was then evaluated for cell killing efficacy 
using a longitudinal cell viability assay with a tenfold 
decrease in TMZ concentration (Figure 4B). Glioma 
cells (U87) were treated with PMTMZ, MTMZ or 
free TMZ (1 μM each) over a 10 days period with 
treatments added to fresh media once a day. PMTMZ 
results were compared directly to either free TMZ or 
MTMZ measurements. Between 1 and 5 days, there 
was no significant difference between the treatment 
groups; free TMZ killed approximately 4% of the cells

future science group
PDGFR-targeted temozolomide micelles to treat tumors    Research Article
and PMTMZ and MTMZ had little to no effect on 
cell death. However, after day 5, PMTMZ dramati-
cally killed the cells at 1 μM (∼82% by day 8). In con-
trast, MTMZ after day 5 showed no appreciable cell 
death, maintaining a 1–2% death rate comparable to 
that of untreated cells.
For Figure 4A the concentration is tenfold higher for 
MTMZ and PMTMZ administered to the cells than 
that of Figure 4B. We would expect that a decrease in 
administered concentration would take longer (5 days) 
to show efficacy as compared with that of a higher con-
centration over a shorter period of time (3 days). Our 
data show a consistent decrease in cell viability over 3 
days at 10 μM PMTMZ (Figure 4A) and after 5 days 1 
μM PMTMZ (Figure 4B). It appears that untargeted, 
MTMZ is unable to deliver a significantly toxic dose 
of TMZ to the cells when only 1 μM is administered.
Mice containing orthotopic gliomas from implanted 
luciferase expressing U87 cells were first evaluated for 
tumor burden using in vivo bioluminescence imaging 
(Supplementary Information 1). Luciferase expressing 
glioma cells were used in conjuction with luciferin sub-
strate (150 μg ml-1) in order to confirm the presence of 
tumor in the brain and verify the location of the tumor 
(Supplementary Information 1B). A standard curve 
for luciferase activity was generated using increasing 
cell numbers of U87 (without luciferase expression as 
control) and U87-luciferase cells incubated with lucif-
erin (Supplementary Information 1A). U87-luciferase 
expressing cells showed a linear increase in luminescence 
with increasing cell numbers. Tumor burden in vivo 
was approximated to cell number using the standard 
in vitro curve (Supplementary Information 1B). After 7 
days of growth, tumors contained approximately 12.3 
million cells.
Mice treated with PMTMZ accumulate the nano-
carrier in the brain over a 24 h period (Figure 5A, top 
panel) as compared with those animals treated with 
untargeted MTMZ (bottom panel). Multiple controls 
were conducted, including mice sham-implanted with 
PBS instead of cells and mice orthotopically implanted 
but administered PBS instead of either MTMZ or 
PMTMZ. No fluorescence was observed in these con-
trol mice as compared with the experimental PMTMZ 
and MTMZ administered mice. A ROI modeled 
around the craniums of the mice showed significant 
fluorescence associated with PMTMZ treated animals. 
Quantitation of fluorescence intensity in an ROI cre-
ated around the brain tumor (white dashed circle) 
confirmed the trend observed in the whole animals 
(Figure 5B). During short incubation periods (3–6 h), 
both targeted PMTMZ and untargeted MTMZ 
micelles were found in the brain tumor. However, 
after 24 h the untargeted micelles washed away and 
the tumors retained 40% more of the targeted micelles 
containing TMZ. To verify that the fluorescence from 
PMTMZ was attributable to uptake specifically within 
the brain, the brains of mice injected with either 
PMTMZ (left) or MTMZ (right) were then excised 
from euthanized mice and imaged (Figure 5C). Biodis-
tribution of PMTMZ was also observed using real time 
in vivo fluorescence (Figure 5D). Animals were imaged 
in the ventral position during the 24-h period. Since 
this is topographic fluorescence imaging, the 3 mm 
depth of the tumor in the dorsal striatum of the brain 
would not be seen from the ventral side because of tis-
sue and bone scattering. PMTMZ was found quickly 
in the colon just postinjection and declined rapidly 
over 6 h. PMTMZ then was excreted through the uri-
nary bladder until almost all fluorescence washed away 
after 24 h. No difference was observed in the excre-
tion pattern of MTMZ as compared with PMTMZ 
(Supplementary Information 2).
Discussion
Temozolomide is an effective, US FDA-approved che-
motherapeutic known for its comprehensive antitu-
mor activity in tumor models, and it is the current 
standard of care for glioblastoma multiforme. In 
previous studies TMZ has proven potent in in vivo 
systems by traversing the CNS, demonstrating accu-
mulation in malignant tissues [5]. Despite its excep-
tional tumor regression activity, TMZ is extremely 
hydrophobic thereby reducing its bioavailability. In 
addition, it also hampers its ability to cross the BBB, 
which remains considerable obstacle in glioma ther-
apy [24]. This necessitates formulation of a drug deliv-
ery system which can encompass these requirements: 
a tailored surface on the carrier to attach biomolecules 
for targeted drug delivery; a biocompatible coating 
which can efficiently encapsulate the hydrophobic 
drug thereby reducing cytotoxicity; stimuli-induced 
(i.e., pH) disruption of the carrier agent for drug 
release to the desired environment.

PDGFR-targeted temozolomide micelles to treat tumors    Research Article
Micelles are the preferred choice of nanocarrier in 
comparison to other potential carriers based on their 
composition. Micelles are composed of amphiphilic 
lipid molecules with a hydrophobic core and hydro-
philic exterior. The hydrophobic core of the micelles 
serves as a container for weakly water-soluble drugs 
while the outer shell can protect encapsulated drugs 
and prevent the drugs from leaching out. Recently, 
polymeric micelles have been utilized as drug carriers 
due to their properties of hydrophilicity and degrad-
ability and due to the ability to tailor their exterior 
surface with multiple functionalities to attach various 
biomolecules [12]. In addition, PEG (hydrophilic poly-
mer) can be incorporated in the micellar composition 
in order to block nonspecific interaction and prolong 
the blood circulation times of the micelles in a biologi-
cal milieu. Other hydrophobic drugs like lomustine, 
carmustine and 5-fluorouracil have been encapsulated 
inside these micelles composed of poly(propylene 
oxide) (PPO), poly(D, L-lactic acid) (PDLLA), poly(e-
caprolactone) (PCL), poly(L-asparate) and poloxam-
ers against brain tumors [25]. Our system is distinct 
because it incorporates a pH-sensitive lipid (PHC), a 
targeting ligand (PDGF), and PEG for prolonged cir-
culation, making it a multifunctional micelle within 
the tumor environment. Since MTMZ and PMTMZ 
range between 10 and 15 nm, their size (<100 nm) is 
advantageous for these carriers to cross the BBB, which 
prohibits larger nanocarriers [26]. The main mecha-
nisms by which micelles target brain tumors are pas-
sive diffusion through a disrupted BBB via permeabil-
ity and enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) 
effect to reach glioma cells or active receptor-mediated 
endocytosis to the tumor region [27].
Treatment of GBMs has been limited by a number 
of medical obstacles, not least of which is the challenge 
of achieving adequate chemotherapeutic concentra-
tions in the tumor without systemic toxicities. As dis-
cussed above, micelle-encapsulated therapies address 
this obstacle. Outside of the brain, micelle packaged 
chemotherapies are being tested in clinical trials and 
are demonstrating improved tolerability compared 
with similar free chemotherapies [28]. However, many 
micelle formulations rely upon ultrasound-guided 
hyperthermia for release of the packaged chemo-
therapies [29]. Though this is a practical approach in 
mouse and rat models [30], ultrasound guided localized 
delivery into the human brain poses quite a logistic 
challenge in the human brain.
This is one motivation for specifically investigat-
ing pH-sensitive micelles for treatment of GBMs. 
Although PDGFR is expressed at low to moderate lev-
els in other organs, focal amplification of the PDGFR 
gene and overexpression of PDGFR is frequently 
observed in aggressive brain tumors. The PDGFR 
targeting induces the GBM tumor cells to internalize 
the micelles via receptor-mediated endocytosis. These 
internalized micelles are then within an appropriate 
pH environment for the intracellular release of TMZ. 
This approach increases the accumulation of micelles 
in the relevant regions of the brain (specifically, in the 
tumor tissue) in order to increase the release of TMZ, 
which leads to an elevated concentration of TMZ in 
the tumor itself. Simultaneously, this approach also 
potentially reduces the risk of systemic toxicity as the 
micelles are targeted to the GBM, such that lysis of 
the micelle should preferentially occur in the tumor 
rather than systemically. The pattern of fluorescence 
observed in the biodistribution study suggests that the 
micelles are processed through both hepatobiliary and 
urinary excretory paths with over 80% clearance from 
initial excretory organ uptake within 72 h.
Due to the high concentration of TMZ (∼100 μM) 
utilized in the clinical setting, this concept of an 
effective and efficient targeting moiety (PMTMZ) is 
vital to the cause [31,32]. Consistent treatment at these 
increased concentrations does not guarantee that all 
of the chemotherapeutic will reach the tumor, but 
instead leads to concern of unintentionally prompting 
drug resistance [33]. Through the use of the targeted, 
pH-responsive chemotherapeutic, the dosage can be 
reduced from approximately 100 μM of free TMZ to 
a minimum of 1 μM PMTMZ resulting in more than 
double the efficacy of glioma cell death and dimin-
ished overall systemic effects.
Conclusion
Targeted micelles loaded with TMZ were designed to 
increase the delivery of the drug into the brain. TMZ-
packaged pH-responsive micelles composed of PEG-
PE amine and PHC surface functionalized with PDGF 
peptide and Dylight 680 fluorophore (PMTMZ) have 
specific uptake and increased cell killing in glial cells 
compared with untargeted micelles (MTMZ). In vivo 
studies demonstrated selective and increased accumu-
lation of PMTMZ in orthotopic gliomas implanted in 
mice.
Future perspective
This study validates the use of a pH-responsive, recep-
tor-mediated targeting moiety for the effective deliv-
ery of chemotherapeutics in the treatment of GBM. 
Through its ability to overcome the widespread clini-
cal obstacle of crossing the BBB, in addition to signifi-
cantly decreasing overall systemic toxicity, this hydro-
phobic drug-loaded carrier creates potential for the 
selective delivery of other anticancer agents. The next 
clear steps for investigating targeted micelles for treat-

Executive summary
Synthesis & characterization
• Temozolomide (TMZ) encapsulated micelles composed of PEG-PE amine and PHC were self-assembled and 
further conjugated with PDGF peptide via covalent amide bond. These conjugated micelles were labeled with 
a fluorescent dye for tracking applications.
• Both targeted and untargeted micelles were 10–15 nm in diameter (dynamic light scattering). They were 
stable for a period of 24 h, both in serum and phosphate-buffered saline.
In vitro studies
• Due to the targeting moiety, PDGF-micelles containing TMZ (PMTMZ) demonstrated higher uptake than 
MTMZ in U87 cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. This was further confirmed with the brefeldin-blocking 
assay in U87 cells.
• PMTMZ demonstrated efficient cell death overall when compared with either micelle-encapsulated TMZ (at 
similar concentrations) or free TMZ.
In vivo & biodistribution studies
• PMTMZ accumulated at a higher level in the brain over a period of 24 h as compared with micelle-
encapsulated TMZ.
• Biodistribution of PMTMZ was immediately observed in the colon, stomach and bladder postinjection, and 
declined rapidly over a period of 6 h.
Conclusion
• This work represents a targeted, pH-responsive micelle system for drug delivery of chemotherapeutics across 
the BBB in the treatment of GBM.
