Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are initiated and 
sustained by self-renewing malignant stem cells; thus, eradication of AML and MDS stem cells is 
required for cure. We identified CD99 as a cell surface protein frequently overexpressed on AML 
and MDS stem cells. Expression of CD99 allows for prospective separation of leukemic stem cells 
(LSCs) from functionally normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in AML, and high CD99 
expression on AML blasts enriches for functional LSCs as demonstrated by limiting dilution 
xenotransplant studies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting CD99 induce the death of AML 
and MDS cells in a SRC-family kinase dependent manner in the absence of immune effector cells 
or complement, and administration of anti-CD99 mAbs exhibit anti-leukemic activity in AML 
xenografts. These data establish CD99 as a novel marker of AML and MDS stem cells, as well as 
a promising therapeutic target in these disorders.

 Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are disorders 
arising in the hematopoietic system that share common molecular origins, with MDS 
patients showing a propensity to progress to AML. AML arises from immature 
hematopoietic cells and is composed of leukemic blasts organized in a developmental 
hierarchy reminiscent of normal hematopoiesis. At the apex of this hierarchy are leukemic 
stem cells (LSCs) that possess the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into non-self 
renewing progeny that comprise the vast majority of leukemic blasts(1, 2). LSCs appear to 
be largely resistant to conventional chemotherapy and are thought to serve as the reservoir of 
minimal residual disease (MRD) that is responsible for disease relapse following initial 
treatment(3). Xenografts and mouse models of AML suggest that fully transformed LSCs 
arise not from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but rather more committed myeloid 
progenitors that acquire aberrant self-renewal(4–6). In contrast, MDS is initiated by 
neoplastic HSCs that fail to give rise to sufficient numbers of mature hematopoietic cells, 
leading to bone marrow failure(7–9). True to their identity as disease stem cells, when 
transplanted into immunodeficient animals MDS HSCs give rise to long-term grafts that 
recapitulate features of MDS(7, 10). Similar to AML LSCs, MDS HSCs are also highly 
resistant to standard therapies(8, 11). Thus, despite the likely differing cellular origins of 
AML and MDS, curative therapies for these malignancies must eliminate disease stem cells 
(LSCs or MDS HSCs, respectively), as they are likely the only self-renewing disease cells in 
the bone marrow (BM).
In efforts to identify potential therapeutic targets in AML, a number of groups have 
identified cell surface proteins preferentially expressed on AML LSCs compared to normal 
HSCs, including CD47(12), CD44(13), CD96(14), TIM3(15, 16), and CD123(17). While 
these antigens are present on LSCs, their relative levels of expression among AML cells 
have not been shown to enrich for functional LSCs. In the context of MDS, aberrant HSC 
cell surface protein expression has not been carefully characterized, and therefore no 
therapies targeting MDS stem cells based on differentially expressed cell surface antigens 
have been described or evaluated.
Here, we demonstrate that CD99 is expressed at increased levels at a high frequency on 
immunophenotypic AML LSCs and MDS HSCs compared to their normal hematopoietic 
counterparts, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Furthermore, high CD99 
expression can be used to identify and prospectively separate leukemic cells from non-
leukemic cells in AML patient BM specimens, as well as to selectively enrich for functional 
LSC activity, as demonstrated by xenotransplantation assays. Ligation of AML and MDS 
stem cells with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing CD99 directly induces 
cytotoxicity in vitro. Moreover, anti-CD99 mAbs exhibit anti-leukemic activity in AML 
xenografts, demonstrating the potential of anti-CD99 mAbs as therapeutic agents.

 Results
MDS HSCs and AML blasts frequently express high levels of CD99
To identify candidate cell surface proteins differentially expressed on MDS HSCs, we 
evaluated the transcriptomes of purified HSCs (lineage negative [LN] 
CD38+CD34−CD90+CD45RA−) from MDS patients and age-matched controls(18), 
identifying 25 dysregulated transcripts encoding cell surface antigens. We used flow 
cytometry (FC) to validate cell surface expression of these antigens on MDS HSCs from 24 
MDS patient specimens (Supp. Table 1) as compared with cord blood (CB) HSC controls, 
identifying CD99 as the most frequently overexpressed among the antigens tested (83% of 
cases as defined by a >50% increase in mean fluorescence intensity [MFI], mean 6.35-fold 
increase, Fig. 1A–B). Normal adult BM HSCs expressed similar levels of cell surface CD99 
as compared with CB HSCs (Supp. Fig. 1). We previously demonstrated that CD99 
transcripts are more highly expressed in LSC-enriched CD34+CD38− AML cells compared 
with normal bone marrow CD34+CD38− cells(14), suggesting that CD99 protein is also 
upregulated on AML LSCs. Comparison of cell surface CD99 expression on unfractionated 
bulk leukemic blasts (CD45[low]SSC[low], representative gating shown in Supp. Fig. 2) 
from 79 paired diagnosis/relapse AML samples (Supp. Table 2) with expression on normal 
CB HSCs by FC confirmed elevated levels of CD99 in 82% of diagnostic samples and 90% 
of relapse samples (average 8.34-fold increase, Fig. 1B).
CD99 distinguishes between leukemic and non-leukemic hematopoietic cells
To determine whether differential CD99 expression can be used to identify and prospectively 
isolate LSCs from pre-leukemic or residual normal HSCs(19), we measured CD99 
expression in the LSC-enriched CD34+CD38− fraction of AML (Fig. 1C, Supp. Fig. 3A). 
Within this fraction, CD99 positive cells expressed an antigenic profile consistent with 
lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs, CD34+CD38−CD90−CD45RA+), the 
immunophenotype most highly enriched for LSCs in the majority of human AML(5), while 
CD99 negative cells exhibited an antigenic profile consistent with a mixture of HSCs and 
multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (CD34+CD38−CD90+/−CD45RA−) present in proportions 
similar to those observed in normal hematopoiesis(20). CD34+CD38− CD99 negative cells 
from ten independent AML specimens were FACS-purified and grown in methylcellulose 
and demonstrated the robust myeloid colony formation characteristic of normal HSCs, but 
not observed with LSCs (Fig. 1D, Supp. Fig. 3B–C, Supp. Fig. 4)(21). These colonies lacked 
the full complement of molecular genetic abnormalities identified in the corresponding bulk 
AML blasts, consistent with their derivation from residual normal or pre-leukemic HSCs(19, 
22, 23) (Fig. 1E–F, Supp. Fig. 3B, Supp. Fig. 4). Moreover, transplantation of FACS-purified 
CD99 negative cells into sublethally irradiated NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) 
mice (n=3) led to lymphomyeloid human engraftment (Fig. 1G, Supp. Fig. 5C), with 
engrafted cells lacking all leukemia associated mutations (Fig. 1E, H), further confirming 
the utility of CD99 in separating LSCs from functionally normal pre-leukemic HSCs. In 
contrast, transplantation of FACS-purified CD99 positive cells into NSG mice (n=4) led to 
engraftment of a rapidly lethal myeloid leukemia (Supp. Fig. 5A–C). This capability to 
prospectively separate leukemic from non-leukemic hematopoiesis may eventually allow for

 effective purging of LSCs from autologous BM grafts that may be used clinically for 
therapeutic HSC transplantation.
CD99 enriches for functional leukemic stem cells
In AML specimens with an identifiable LMPP-like population 
(CD34+CD38−CD90−CD45RA+, n=69) within the CD99 positive leukemic fraction, this 
LSC-enriched population consistently expressed higher levels of CD99 compared with more 
differentiated blasts, demonstrating intra-leukemic heterogeneity of CD99 expression and 
suggesting that LSCs exhibit the highest levels of CD99 (Fig. 2A, Supp. Fig. 2). Consistent 
with the chemoresistant nature of LSCs, CD99 expression was significantly higher on 
leukemic blasts at relapse when compared directly with paired specimens from the time of 
diagnosis (Fig. 2B). To test whether CD99 enriches for LSC function among CD99 positive 
leukemic blasts, we transplanted the highest and lowest CD99 expressing leukemic cells (top 
and bottom 10%, respectively) within the LSC-enriched LMPP-like fraction of a CD34 
positive primary AML specimen into sublethally irradiated NSG mice. Leukemia-initiating 
cell (L-IC) activity was only observed in mice transplanted with the top 10% of CD99 
expressing LMPP-like cells, indicating that CD99 is not only highly expressed in AML, but 
is also expressed at the highest levels on functional LSCs (Fig. 2C–D). Similar results were 
obtained when transplanting the highest and lowest CD99 expressing leukemic cells (top and 
bottom 15%, respectively) from a CD34 negative AML (Fig. 2E, gating strategy shown in 
Supp. Fig. 6A–B), which represents a subset of AMLs for which a strategy to enrich for 
functionally defined LSCs has not been reported. To test whether CD99 can enrich for 
functional LSCs irrespective of CD34 and CD38 expression, we transplanted the highest and 
lowest CD99 expressing leukemic cells (top and bottom 10%, respectively) among bulk 
unfractionated leukemic blasts (CD45[low]SSC[low]) from an AML with variable CD34 
and CD38 expression, demonstrating a 10-fold increase in L-IC activity in the CD99 high 
fraction (Fig. 2F, gating strategy shown in Supp. Fig. 6C–D). When the CD99 high and 
low populations from both CD34+ and CD34− AMLs were cultured in vitro in liquid culture 
supplemented with cytokines, CD99 high cells demonstrated improved viability compared 
with CD99 low cells (Supp. Fig. 7), a previously described characteristic of LSC-enriched 
blasts in AML(24, 25).
RNA-sequencing of the top 10% and bottom 10% of CD99 expressing blasts within the 
LMPP-like fraction of seven primary AML specimens and the bulk fraction of a CD34− 
AML (post-sort data shown in Fig. 2C, Supp. Fig. 6, Supp. Fig. 8) revealed 1558 
differentially expressed genes (p<0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis(26) revealed 
enrichment for LSC(27–29) and HSC(28, 30) gene signatures in CD99 high blasts (Fig. 2G–
H). Furthermore, CD99 high blast associated transcriptomes were depleted for ribosomal 
gene transcripts and gene signatures associated with translation (Fig. 2I), consistent with 
recent reports that both normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cells exhibit highly 
regulated levels of translation(31, 32). Since functional LSCs have been demonstrated to 
exist in populations outside of the LMPP fraction of AML, we performed RNA-sequencing 
of the top 10% and bottom 10% of CD99 expressing cells among bulk leukemic blasts from 
six of the eight primary AMLs initially tested (excluding one AML that was entirely CD34− 
and one that was entirely CD34+, post-sort data shown in Supp. Fig. 9) and found

 enrichment for the same LSC and HSC gene signatures, as well as depletion of translation 
associated gene signatures (Fig. 2G–I).
In six of the specimens confirmed to harbor recurrent AML-associated somatic mutations, 
we were able to assess for the burden of mutant transcripts in the CD99 high and low 
fractions. In three of the six specimens, the variant transcript frequency (VTF) was higher in 
the CD99 high fractions (MSK AML-002 [particularly in the LMPP fraction], MSK 
AML-005, and MSK AML-006), while there was no difference in two specimens (MSK 
AML-003, UP31) and a decrease in VTF in one specimen (MSK AML-006) (Supp. Fig. 10). 
Thus, in a subset of AMLs, CD99 expression may correlate in part with clonal 
heterogeneity.
Collectively, these data provide functional and transcriptomal evidence that CD99 is 
preferentially expressed on LSCs, identifying CD99 as the first LSC specific cell surface 
marker that can be used to selectively enrich for LSC activity in AML. Other previously 
identified LSC markers do not appear likely to share this feature, as they are expressed at 
equal or decreased levels on LSC-enriched fractions compared to more differentiated blasts 
(Supp. Fig. 11)(12–15, 17). Thus, these data validate CD99 expression as a novel method for 
the purification of LSCs, which will allow for more refined studies of this biologically and 
clinically significant cell population.
Anti-CD99 mAbs are directly cytotoxic to AML and MDS cells
As therapeutic targeting of CD99 with mAbs has shown promise in other human cancers 
such as Ewing’s sarcoma(33), we tested the ability of anti-CD99 mAbs to induce 
cytotoxicity in AML and MDS stem/progenitor cells in vitro. The anti-CD99 mAb clone 
H036-1.1 was cytotoxic to purified primary MDS CD34+ cells (Fig. 3A) as well as LMPP-
like AML blasts (Fig. 3B), AML CD34+ blasts (Fig. 3C), and bulk leukemic blasts (Fig. 
3D). Of note, the only primary AML specimen we tested that was resistant to anti-CD99 
mAb treatment harbored a BCR-ABL translocation (Fig. 3C). In addition, when treated with 
lower concentrations of anti-CD99 mAb, MDS HSPCs and AML blasts with at least partial 
CD34 expression exhibited selective depletion of the least mature populations (either 
CD34+CD38− or CD34+) (Fig. 3E–F, Supp. Fig. 12). Anti-CD99 mAbs were also cytotoxic 
to myeloid leukemia cell lines such as the AML-derived cell line MOLM13 (Fig. 3G). Anti-
CD99 mAbs induced apoptosis as confirmed by annexin V and activated caspase 3 staining 
(Fig. 3H, Supp. Fig. 13) in the absence of immune effector cells or complement, consistent 
with a direct cytotoxic effect.
Since normal HSCs and endothelial cells express low and intermediate levels of CD99, 
respectively (Supp. Fig. 1), we tested whether cytotoxic anti-CD99 mAbs would affect their 
growth or survival. At concentrations toxic to AML and MDS cells, anti-CD99 mAbs had 
minimal effects on HSC growth in liquid culture supplemented with cytokines (Fig. 3I) and 
exerted no significant toxicity to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Fig. 
3J). Ex vivo incubation of leukemic blasts from an AML patient previously shown to engraft 
NSG mice with anti-CD99 mAb (clone H036-1.1) for 45 minutes prior to 
xenotransplantation completely abolished their engraftment capability (Fig. 4A–C). To rule 
out a possible effect of anti-CD99 mAbs on LSC homing and to determine whether anti-

 CD99 mAbs can eradicate LSCs in vivo, NSG mice transplanted with leukemic blasts from 
the same AML specimen were allowed to engraft for two weeks prior to treatment with 15 
μg of anti-CD99 mAb (clone H036-1.1) or isotype control (Fig. 4A). One treatment with 
anti-CD99 mAb was sufficient to completely abolish AML engraftment as measured in the 
BM at five months post-transplantation (Fig. 4C, Supp. Fig. 14). When followed out to 11 
months, none of the mice transplanted with AML cells treated with anti-CD99 mAb ex vivo 
or in vivo demonstrated engraftment. Conversely, treatment of normal CB HSCs with anti-
CD99 mAb (H036-1.1) ex vivo or in vivo in the same manner did not have any significant 
effect on engraftment in the BM or PB (Fig. 4D–E). The eradication of LSCs in vivo by anti-
CD99 mAbs is likely due to the direct cytotoxic effect of the antibody, since IgM antibodies 
such as H036-1.1 have minimal capability to induce antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC)(34), and NSG mice are deficient in hemolytic complement(35).
To determine whether anti-CD99 mAbs have anti-leukemic activity against established 
AML, we transplanted NSG mice with four independent AML specimens and confirmed 
human leukemic engraftment in both the BM and PB (with the exception of specimen UP32, 
which demonstrated detectable engraftment in the BM, but not PB) (Fig. 4F). Engrafted 
mice were treated for four weeks with the anti-CD99 mAb H036-1.1 (15 μg/ml three times 
weekly) or isotype control. Additionally, we generated a novel anti-CD99 mAb (clone 10D6, 
IgG1κ isotype) that demonstrates direct cytotoxicity to AML cells (Supp. Fig. 15), and we 
also treated engrafted mice with this mAb for four weeks (40 μg daily). Treatment with 
either anti-CD99 mAb (clone H036-1.1 or 10D6) led to a significant reduction in leukemic 
burden in both the BM and PB (Fig. 4G). In contrast, treatment of NSG mice engrafted with 
normal CB HSCs with anti-CD99 mAbs (H036-1.1 or 10D6) had minimal effects on 
engraftment, with the exception of a modest reduction in PB chimerism with clone 10D6 
(Fig. 4H–I). Together, these results indicate that anti-CD99 mAbs preferentially induce 
death in AML disease stem cells, possess a potentially large therapeutic window, and 
represent a promising AML stem cell-directed therapeutic strategy.
Anti-CD99 monoclonal antibodies activate SRC-family kinases
To determine the mechanism of anti-CD99 mAb induced cell death, we assessed the effect 
of anti-CD99 mAbs on SRC-family kinase (SFK) activation, since CD99 has been shown to 
negatively regulate SFK activation in osteosarcoma cells(36). We confirmed that CD99 
negatively regulates SFK activation in AML cell lines, as shRNA-mediated knockdown of 
CD99 in the AML cell line MOLM13 induced SFK activation, while overexpression 
repressed SFK activation (Fig. 5A–B). Cytotoxic anti-CD99 mAbs recapitulated the effects 
of CD99 knockdown, inducing rapid and robust SFK activation in both AML cell lines (Fig. 
5C) as well as primary AML blasts (Fig. 5D). Pharmacologic inhibition of SFKs with the 
small molecule inhibitors PP2 or dasatinib significantly attenuated anti-CD99 mAb induced 
cytotoxicity in both AML cell lines (Fig. 5E) and primary AML blasts (Fig. 5F), confirming 
that anti-CD99 mAbs promote cell death in part by inducing SFK activation. Consistent with 
the deleterious effects of rapid SFK activation, we observed cell cycle arrest (Fig. 5G), as 
well as enrichment for gene expression signatures associated with DNA damage response, 
replication stress, and the unfolded protein response (Fig. 5I). The chronic myeloid leukemia 
blast crisis derived cell line K562 was highly resistant to the cytotoxic effects of anti-CD99

 mAbs (Fig. 5J, Supp. Fig. 15). Similar to the resistant primary sample shown in Fig. 3C, this 
cell line harbors the constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL, which promotes high 
basal levels of SFK activation(37). Thus, resistance to anti-CD99 mAb induced cytotoxicity 
is likely due to the ability of K562 cells to better tolerate acute SFK activation. To determine 
whether SFK activation is sufficient to induce cell death, we generated a constitutively active 
SRC mutant (Y530F) (Fig. 5K) and overexpressed it in anti-CD99 mAb sensitive and 
resistant cell lines (MOLM13 and K562, respectively). While MOLM13 cells exhibited a 
marked decrease in cell growth (Fig. 5L), cell cycle arrest (Supp. Fig. 16), and increased 
apoptosis (Fig. 5M) in response to constitutive SRC activation, thereby phenocopying the 
effects of treatment with anti-CD99 mAb, K562 cells demonstrated a modest decrease in 
growth and no increase in apoptosis (Fig. 5L–M) or cell cycle arrest (Supp. Fig. 16). 
Together, these findings suggest that anti-CD99 mAbs promote cell death by inducing SFK 
activation and oncogenic stress in myeloid leukemias that do not exhibit constitutive 
activation of SFKs.
Discussion
Both AML and MDS fulfill central tenets of the cancer stem cell hypothesis, whereby 
disease-initiating stem cells display the ability to self-renew and differentiate into non-self-
renewing progeny that comprise the majority of neoplastic cells(1, 7–9). As disease-
initiating cells represent the only self-renewing cells in these diseases, therapies aimed at 
inducing durable remissions or cures must target these populations, which are resistant to 
current standard therapies(3, 8, 11). Prior studies have identified a number of antigens 
differentially expressed on AML LSCs(12–17), but these markers are not specific for, or 
enriched on, functional LSCs (Supp. Fig. 11). Examples of therapies that target cell surface 
antigens in AML include antibodies against CD47 to enhance phagocytic clearance of 
blasts(12), against CD44 to disrupt blast:niche interactions(13), and against CD123 to impair 
cytokine signaling(17). Numerous separate efforts to target LSCs with small molecule 
inhibitors of self-renewal or survival pathways are also underway(38, 39). Despite these 
efforts, strategies to exploit unique AML LSC surface antigens have yet to be successfully 
translated to the clinic. Similarly, therapies directly targeting MDS stem cells have yet to be 
described, which is not surprising since very little information is available regarding aberrant 
antigen expression on MDS HSCs.
By examining a large number of primary AML and MDS patient specimens, we have 
identified CD99 as a cell surface antigen expressed at increased levels on disease-initiating 
cells compared with normal HSPCs in the vast majority AML and MDS cases. Similar to a 
subset of previously defined AML associated cell surface markers present on LSCs(12, 14–
16), differences in CD99 expression allow for the prospective separation of leukemic blasts 
from residual normal or pre-leukemic hematopoietic cells. However, CD99 also exhibits the 
unique capability to enrich for functional LSCs within the leukemic blast population as 
demonstrated by limiting dilution xenograft assays, even when assessing the LN 
CD34+CD38−CD90−CD45RA+ LMPP-like fraction of AML, which is most highly 
enriched for LSC activity(5). This characteristic is not shared by any other previously 
described LSC markers and will allow for more refined studies of the functional and 
molecular features of LSCs in the future.

 Given the high frequency of aberrant CD99 expression in our series of AML and MDS cases 
and the fact that these cases were not selected with prior knowledge of their cytogenetic and 
mutational profiles, our studies suggest that CD99 is likely to be an exploitable therapeutic 
target in the vast majority of AML and MDS patients. Although we do not expect all 
myeloid leukemias to be sensitive to this single strategy, we speculate that it may be possible 
to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anti-CD99 mAbs by combining their direct cytotoxic 
activity with other strategies including conjugation with cytotoxic adducts (40, 41) or the 
derivation of bi-specific antibodies to simultaneously target other leukemia associated 
antigens or recruit cytotoxic T-cells (42, 43). The robust and rapid activation of SFKs 
following anti-CD99 mAb binding suggests a mechanism of cytotoxicity via induction of 
oncogenic stress, as has been described for a number of oncogenes such as RAS(44), c-
MYC(45), BCR-ABL(46), and SYK(47). Accordingly, overexpression of constitutively 
active SRC is sufficient to induce apoptosis in anti-CD99 mAb sensitive MOLM13 cells, but 
not in K562 cells, which are relatively resistant to anti-CD99 mAbs and exhibit high basal 
levels of SFK activation. One possible explanation for the relative resistance of K562 cells 
may be their lack of functional CDKN2A and TP53(48), both critical mediators of 
oncogene-induced cell cycle arrest(44). Thus, while prior studies have suggested inhibiting 
the SFK pathway in AML as a potential therapeutic strategy (49), our studies demonstrate 
that activation of SFKs may represent a novel therapeutic vulnerability in myeloid 
malignancies.
Although CD99 appears to be a robust marker of disease stem cells and a promising 
therapeutic target in AML, a number of unresolved issues remain. First, it is not clear 
whether CD99 is only upregulated in fully transformed LSCs, or whether it is also 
upregulated on a subset of pre-leukemic HSCs. A number of recent studies have identified 
pre-leukemic HSCs which functionally give rise to normal hematopoiesis but which may 
harbor a subset of the full complement of somatic mutations which are present in fully 
transformed leukemia(19, 22, 23). In our studies, the CD99 negative fraction of a number of 
specimens completely lacked mutations previously described to be pre-leukemic (e.g. 
DNMT3A and IDH1/2)(19, 22, 23). Thus, it appears that CD99 may be upregulated on pre-
leukemic HSCs in some AMLs. Further characterization of CD99 positive and negative 
populations by comprehensive targeted sequencing and other approaches will be necessary 
to fully characterize the stage of leukemogenesis during which CD99 is upregulated, as well 
as the mechanisms of its upregulation. Identifying the spectrum of pre-leukemic HSCs that 
upregulate CD99 will be important to assess whether anti-CD99 mAbs may also target this 
potential reservoir of pre-neoplastic cells that may re-initiate disease.
Second, although we demonstrate that immunophenotypically defined disease initiating 
MDS HSCs (7, 9) express high levels of CD99, it is unclear whether these high levels of 
CD99 expression are sufficient to prospectively separate MDS HSCs from residual normal 
HSCs. We were unable to assess this directly due to the limited cellularity of the MDS 
samples we evaluated. Additionally, given the high burden of involvement of the HSC 
compartment by the MDS clone at diagnosis (>95–99% based on prior studies)(7, 8, 11), 
addressing this question may require evaluation of CD99 expression in the post-therapy 
and/or minimal residual disease setting, at which time MDS HSCs persist at significant, but 
likely lower levels(8, 11). Single cell transcriptomal/exome sequencing approaches may also

 have the potential to address this question by correlating differences in CD99 expression 
with somatic mutational status. Finally, it is unclear whether high CD99 expression enriches 
for disease initiating function among MDS HSCs. We were unable to address this question 
experimentally since current MDS xenograft models require transplantation of relatively 
large numbers of cells(7, 10), thereby not allowing for limiting dilution analyses using 
samples with limited cellularity.
In sum, our evaluation of primary patient specimens and xenograft models reveals that CD99 
is a novel AML LSC and MDS HSC marker that also identifies cells with functional disease-
initiating capability, particularly in AML. Moreover, anti-CD99 mAbs effectively target 
AML LSCs, directly inducing their death in part by activating SFKs. These studies establish 
the use of anti-CD99 mAbs as a promising and novel disease stem cell directed therapeutic 
strategy and identifies a previously unappreciated molecular vulnerability in myeloid 
malignancies.
Materials and Methods
Experimental Design
Research objectives—The primary objectives of this study were to characterize the 
frequency of expression of CD99 on disease initiating stem cells in MDS and AML, and to 
determine the potential of anti-CD99 mAbs as potential therapeutic agents. Our initial data 
confirmed our pre-specified hypotheses that CD99 is frequently expressed on disease 
initiating stem cells in MDS and AML, and that anti-CD99 mAbs exhibit direct cytotoxicity 
to disease cells. Based on our initial data, we hypothesized that CD99 may also enrich for 
functional leukemic stem cells, and that anti-CD99 mAbs may exert their cytotoxic effects 
by modulating cell-signaling pathways regulated by CD99. Our secondary objectives were 
thus to validate CD99 as a cell surface marker which can be used to enrich for functional 
leukemic stem cells, and to characterize cell-signaling pathways perturbed by anti-CD99 
mAbs.
Research subjects and study design—For validation of CD99 expression, 24 MDS 
specimens and 79 AML specimens were analyzed (39 diagnostic specimens and 40 relapse 
specimens- for one patient, relapse specimens were available from two different time 
points). No patient samples were excluded from the analysis or inclusion in results. Human 
AML and MDS specimens were obtained from patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Adelaide, and the University of 
Rochester with informed consent under IRB-approved protocols. Umbilical cord blood (CB) 
specimens were purchased from the New York Blood Center (New York, New York). 
Normal human BM specimens were purchased from AllCells Inc. (Emeryville, California).
For limiting dilution analyses, at least 21 xenografts were analyzed for each AML specimen 
to ensure a large enough sample size for statistical comparison. Experimental groups (e.g. 
top 10% and bottom 10% of CD99 expressing LSCs) were transplanted into NSG mice in a 
randomized manner, with age and sex of animals balanced between groups. Animals that 
died within one week of transplantation were censored, but no other animals were excluded 
from the analysis. Outcome assessments were performed in a blinded manner (animals were

 assigned a random numerical code prior to analysis). In vitro cytotoxicity assays were 
performed on consecutive primary MDS and AML specimens based on availability and 
adequate cellularity, with no samples excluded from analysis or inclusion in results.
Experimental Methods
Flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting—All FACS-sorting and 
flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San 
Jose, California). Analysis of leukemic blasts and LSCs in human AML specimens was 
performed using the following antibodies: CD19 (HIB29), CD3 (HIT3a), CD34 (581), 
CD45RA (HI100), CD47 (CC2C6), and CD44 (BJ18) from Biolegend, San Diego, 
California, CD38 (HIT2), CD99 (3B2/TA8), CD123 (6H6), and TIM3 (F38-2E2) from 
eBioscience, San Diego, California, and CD90 (5E10) from BD Biosciences, San Jose, 
California. Given the expression of aberrant differentiation antigens on leukemic cells, an 
abbreviated lineage stain of CD3/CD19 was used, with lineage negative (LN) 
CD34+CD38−CD90+CD45RA− cells designated HSCs, LN CD34+CD38−CD90−CD45RA
− cells MPPs, and LN CD34+CD38−CD90−CD45RA+ cells LMPPs.
Analysis of HSPCs in human MDS specimens and cord blood was performed using a full 
lineage stain including: CD2 (RPA-2.10), CD3 (HIT3a), CD4 (RPA-T4), CD7 (M-T701), 
CD8 (RPA-T8), CD10 (HI10a), CD11b (ICRF44), CD14 (TuK4), CD19 (CC2C6), CD20 
(2H7), GPA (HIR2), and CD56 (B159), all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, California. 
Definitions of HSCs, MPPs, and LMPPs/LSCs remained as described above.
Analysis of human and murine cells in xenograft experiments was performed using the 
following antibodies: Mouse Ter119 (TER-119) and CD45.1 (A20) from eBioscience, San 
Diego, California, human CD45 (2D1), CD99 (3B2/TA8), CD38 (HIT2), and CD33 
(WM53) from eBioscience, San Diego, California and human CD34 (581) from Biolegend, 
San Diego, California. Engrafted human cells were identified based on their 
immunophenotype: mouse Ter119 and mouse CD45 negative, human CD45 positive, with 
confirmation of CD34, CD38, CD99, CD45RA, and CD33 expression depending on the 
immunophenotype of the transplanted AML.
Methylcellulose colony assays—HSPCs (CD3-CD19-CD34+CD38−) from primary 
AML specimens were double FACS-sorted to >95% purity and seeded in methylcellulose 
with myeloid/erythroid-promoting cytokines (MethoCult H4435; Stem Cell Technologies, 
Vancouver, Canada). Colony number and lineage were scored after 14 days with an 
Olympus BX41 microscope.
Genotyping of methylcellulose colonies—Methylcellulose colonies were aspirated, 
and cells were resuspended in sterile water and heated to 95°C for 10 minutes. FLT3 
mutational status was determined by PCR using primers that yield a product of 329 bp for 
wild-type alleles, and products of varying larger sizes for ITD alleles. Reactions were 
performed in 50 μl total volume containing 5 μl template, 5 μl each of 10 μM forward primer 
11F (5′-GCAATTTAGGTATGAAAGCCAGC-3′) and reverse primer 12R (5′-
CTTTCAGCATTTTGACGGCAACC-3′), 1.25 U Taq DNA Polymerase, 50 mM KCl, 30 
mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM Mg, and 200 μM of each dNTP. Thermocycling conditions were as

 follows: 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 62°C, and 30 sec at 72°C for 40 cycles. The presence of 
the BCR-ABL (e6a2) translocation present in MSK AML-005 was detected using the same 
reaction mixture with forward primer (5′-GACTTCATTATCAGCTCAGAATGCACC-3′) 
and reverse primer (5′-AGATACTCAGCGGCATTGCGG-3′). Thermocycling conditions 
were as follows: 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 56°C, and 60 sec at 72°C for 40 cycles. The 
mutational status of other genes was determined by Sanger sequencing of PCR fragments 
amplified from genomic DNA using the primers listed in Table 3.
In vitro antibody incubation assays—Cell lines were plated at a concentration of 
2,500 cells per 20 μl of RPMI 1640, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Thermo Fisher, 
Rockford, Illinois), and Penicillin (5000 U/ml)/Streptomycin (5000 μg/ml)(Life 
Technologies, Carlsbad, California) in a flat-bottom 384-well tissue culture treated plate 
(Corning, Corning, New York). Primary MDS, AML, and CB specimens were plated at a 
concentration of 700–2,500 cells per 20 μl of Stemspan SFEM media (Stem Cell 
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with 40 μg/ml human LDL (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and the following cytokines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, New 
Jersey): 100 ng/ml Flt-3 ligand, 100 ng/ml SCF, 50 ng/ml TPO, 20 ng/ml IL-3, and 20 ng/ml 
IL-6. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were plated at a concentration of 
5,000 cells per 20 ul of M199 medium (Thermo Fisher) containing 20% heat-inactivated 
fetal calf serum (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, Illinois), 15 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, Missouri), 50 mg/L EC mitogen (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, 
Massachusetts), 50 mg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri), 2mM L-Glutamine 
(Cellgro, Manassas, Virginia), and Penicillin (100 IU/ml)/Streptomycin (100 μg/ml)/
Amphotericin B (250 ng/ml)(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California). For in vitro antibody 
incubation assays, we utilized anti-CD99 mAb clone H036-1.1 (Abcam, Cambridge, United 
Kingdom) in sterile PBS. H036-1.1 was added at the indicated concentrations up to 35 
μg/ml, and cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. At the end of the treatment 
time course, cells were resuspended in buffer (phosphate buffered saline with 2% FCS) 
containing 100 ng/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and quantified 
using flow cytometry counting beads (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California). The SFK 
inhibitor dasatinib (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, Texas) was resuspended in DMSO and 
used at a final concentration of 1 μM. The SFK inhibitor PP2 (EMD Millipore) was 
resuspended in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 20 μM.
Apoptosis assays—Annexin V and caspase 3 staining was performed according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California). For cell cycle analysis, 
cells were stained with a LIVE/DEAD fixable dead cell stain (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, 
California) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by fixation and 
permeabilization (BD cytofix/cytoperm). Cells were then stained with Ki-67 (SolA15) from 
eBioscience (San Diego, California) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by DAPI 
(2 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Site-directed mutagenesis—Mutant SRC (Y530F) was generated from a human SRC 
cDNA (CCSB-Broad Lentiviral Expression Library, Open Biosystems, Lafayette, Colorado) 
using a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s

 instructions (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) and the following primers: sense 
(5′-CCACCGAGCCCCAGTTCCAGCCCG-3′) and anti-sense (5′-
CGGGCTGGAACTGGGGCTCGGTGG-3′). Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by 
Sanger sequencing, and the mutant SRC cDNA was cloned into a lentiviral expression 
vector (pLentiLox 3.7, pLL3.7) containing a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Lentiviral 
particles were generated using standard techniques(50). To induce ectopic wild-type SRC or 
SRC (Y530F) expression, 50 ng/ml of doxycycline was added to the media.
Western blotting—5–10 × 106 MOLM13 cells were incubated with H036-1.1 or isotype 
control (20 μg/ml) for a 90-minute time course. At each time point, cells were pelleted, 
washed in PBS containing sodium orthovanadate, and lysed using Pierce IP lysis buffer 
(Thermo Pierce, Rockford, Illinois) containing FOCUS-Protease Arrest (GBiosciences, 
Houston, Texas) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail II (EMD Millipore, Billerica, 
Massachusetts). Western blotting was performed using anti-CD99 mAb clone EPR3097Y 
from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom), and phospho-SRC family kinase (Y416) mAb 
clone D49G4, total SRC family kinase mAb clone 32G6, β-actin mAb clone 13E5, and 
HSP90 mAb clone C45G5 from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, Massachusetts). 
Electrochemiluminescent reagent (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) was applied to 
Western blots and images were acquired using a GE ImageQuant LAS 4000 instrument (GE 
Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Densitometry analysis was performed using 
GelQuant.NET image analysis software (http://biochemlabsolutions.com/).
Xenotransplantation assays—All mice were housed in Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center (MSKCC) animal facilities. All animal procedures were conducted in 
accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) at MSKCC. 
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice 8–10 weeks of age were used for xenogeneic 
transplantation assays. FACS-sorted human cells were transplanted into sublethally 
irradiated NSG mice (185 cGy) via retro-orbital injection. Hu-CD34-NSG™ mice engrafted 
with human cord blood derived HSCs (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were also 
utilized for experiments shown in Fig. 4D. Peripheral blood and BM analysis was performed 
by flow cytometry at the indicated times using the antibodies described above. Anti-CD99 
mAb clone H036-1.1 or IgM isotype control was administered by retro-orbital injection, 
and.anti-CD99 mAb clone 10D6 or IgG isotype control was administered by intraperitoneal 
injection.
RNA sequencing—Primary AML specimens were FACS-sorted into Trizol LS (Thermo 
Fisher, Rockford, Illinois). cDNA libraries were prepared using a SMARTer mRNA 
amplification kit (Clontech, Mountain View, California) and sequencing was performed 
using the Hi-Seq platform (Illumina, San Diego, California) with 40 million paired end reads 
per sample.
Statistical and data analysis
All flow cytometry data were analyzed using Flowjo (TreeStar, Ashland, Oregon). L-IC 
frequency estimations were calculated using a Poisson distribution probability calculator (L-

Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). RNA-seq data was aligned by STAR(51) to human 
genome hg37 and reads for each gene were counted by HTSeq(52). Differentially expressed 
genes were identified by DESeq2(53), followed by gene set enrichment analyses(26). P-
values were calculated using two-tailed t-tests (Prism 7, GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, California). 
Estimated variation was taken into account for each group of data and is indicated as 
standard error or standard deviation in each figure legend.

 Fig. 1. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells express 
high levels of CD99
(A) Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs; lineage negative [LN] CD34+CD38−CD90+CD45RA
−) from patients with MDS (n=24) and normal cord blood (CB) controls (n=24) were 
analyzed by flow cytometry (FC) for CD99 expression, (B) shown as fold-change CD99 
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on MDS HSCs compared with CB HSCs. Unfractionated 
blasts (CD45[low]SSC[low]) from diagnostic (n=39) or relapse (n=40) AML specimens and 
normal CB HSCs (n=18) were analyzed by FC for CD99 expression, shown as fold-change 
CD99 MFI on AML blasts compared with CB HSCs. Error bars represent ±SEM.

 CD34+CD38− cells from AML specimen MSK AML-003. By immunophenotype, CD99 
negative cells include HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs; LN 
CD34+CD38−CD90−CD45RA−), while CD99 positive cells are almost entirely composed 
of lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor-like cells (LMPP-like; LN 
CD34+CD38−CD90−CD45RA+). (D) When these populations were plated in 
methylcellulose (750 cells in triplicate), normal myeloid/erythroid colonies formed only 
from the CD99 negative fraction. Error bars represent ±SEM of triplicates. (E) All CD99 
negative derived methylcellulose colonies lacked the heterozygous FLT3-ITD and NPM1 
abnormalities present in MSK AML-003, while 14 out of 33 sequenced colonies harbored a 
heterozygous DNMT3A R882P abnormality. CD99 negative sorted cells and xenografts 
lacked DNMT3A, NPM1, and FLT3 mutations, while all three abnormalities were present in 
CD99 positive sorted cells and xenografts. (F) Summary of the percentage of CD99 negative 
cell derived colonies from ten AML specimens that were positive for disease associated 
mutations in the indicated alleles (which were confirmed to be present in the bulk fraction of 
each corresponding AML). Each data point represents a summary of results for each AML 
harboring a particular mutation (shown in detail in Supp. Fig. 4). (G) CD99 negative cells 
(2,500 cells) were transplanted into sublethally irradiated NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ 
(NSG) mice (n=3), with mice demonstrating human lymphomyeloid engraftment in the BM 
10 months after transplantation. Representative FACS-plots are shown from two CD99 low 
xenografts. (H) Sanger sequencing traces reveal the absence of DNMT3A R882P and NPM1 
W288fs mutations in CD99 negative cell derived xenografts, and the presence of both of 
these abnormalities in CD99 positive cell derived xenografts.

 sublethally irradiated NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Sort gates were drawn 
based on normal HSC, MPP, and LMPP populations in CB as depicted in Fig. 1A. (D) 
Leukemic engraftment (defined as >0.1% detectable human cells in the bone marrow >12 
weeks after transplantation) was only observed in mice transplanted with “top 10%” CD99 
expressing LMPP-like blasts. (E) The highest and lowest CD99 expressing blasts (top and 
bottom 15%, respectively) from the CD34 negative AML specimen UP32 were FACS-
purified to >95% purity and transplanted at limiting dilution into NSG mice. Leukemic 
engraftment was only observed in mice transplanted with “top 15%” CD99 expressing 
blasts. (F) The highest and lowest CD99 expressing blasts (top and bottom 10%, 
respectively) from the bulk (CD45[low] SSC[low] CD45RA+) fraction of AML specimen 
MSK AML-003 were FACS-purified to >95% purity and transplanted at limiting dilution 
into NSG mice. Leukemia-initiating cell activity was estimated to be 10-fold higher in the 
“top 10%” CD99 expressing blasts. (G–I) The top 10% and bottom 10% of CD99 
expressing blasts within the LMPP-like fraction of eight independent primary AML 
specimens, as well as the bulk fraction from six of these AML specimens, were FACS-
purified and RNA-sequencing was performed. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed in “top 
10%” CD99 expressing blasts enrichment for LSC (27–29) and HSC gene signatures (28, 
30), as well depletion of ribosomal gene transcripts (KEGG)(54) and gene signatures 
associated with translation (REACTOME)(55, 56).

 Fig. 5. Anti-CD99 mAbs induce apoptosis by promoting SRC-family kinase (SFK) activation
(A) MOLM13 cells were transduced with an shRNA targeting CD99. Western blot 
confirmed knockdown of CD99, which was accompanied by an increase in SFK activation, 
as measured by pSRC (Y416). (B) MOLM13 cells were transduced to overexpress CD99 
under a doxycycline inducible promoter, and 1 μg/ml doxycycline was added to the media. 
Western blot confirmed overexpression of CD99 24 hours after addition of doxycycline,

(1 μM) or DMSO for eight hours prior to incubation with anti-CD99 mAb (H036-1.1, 5 
μg/ml) for 48 hours. Anti-CD99 mAb induced a significant reduction in cell number that 
was partially rescued by dasatinib treatment. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (unpaired t-

Incubation of MOLM13 cells with anti-CD99 mAb (H036-1.1, 20 μg/ml) for 36 hours leads 
to a marked redistribution of cells from the G1 to the G0 or S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle. 
*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (unpaired t-test). (I) MOLM13 cells were incubated with 
anti-CD99 mAb (H036-1.1, 36 μg/ml) and after 24 hours live cells (propidium iodide 
negative) were FACS-purified and RNA-sequencing was performed. Gene set enrichment 
analysis revealed enrichment for gene signatures associated with DNA-damage 
response(57), cell cycle arrest, replication stress, and the unfolded protein response(55, 58). 
(J) K562 cells were incubated with anti-CD99 mAb (H036-1.1) for 48 hours. The IC50 was 
not reached using mAb concentrations up to 17.4 μg/ml. The sensitivity of MOLM13 cells to 
anti-CD99 mAb, as shown in Fig. 3G, is juxtaposed for comparison. Error bars represent 
±SEM of biological triplicates. (K) A constitutively active SRC (Y530F) mutant was 
generated by site directed mutagenesis. (L) MOLM13 and K562 cells were transduced to 
overexpress wild-type SRC or mutant SRC (Y530F) using a doxycycline-inducible system; 
SRC (Y530F) expression induced a greater decrease in cell growth in MOLM13 as 
compared with K562 cells. Error bars represent ±SEM of biological triplicates. **P<0.01, 
***P<0.001 (unpaired t-test). (M) SRC (Y530F) expression induced apoptosis, as measured 
by activated caspase 3, in MOLM13 but not K562 cells. Error bars represent ±SEM of
