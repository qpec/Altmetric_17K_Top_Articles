ABSTRACT
Objective The global burden of colorectal cancer
(CRC) is expected to increase by 60% to more than
2.2 million new cases and 1.1 million deaths by 2030.
In this study, we aim to describe the recent CRC
incidence and mortality patterns and trends linking the
findings to the prospects of reducing the burden through
cancer prevention and care.
Design Estimates of sex-specific CRC incidence and
mortality rates in 2012 were extracted from the
GLOBOCAN database. Temporal patterns were assessed
for 37 countries using data from Cancer Incidence in
Five Continents (CI5) volumes I–X and the WHO
mortality database. Trends were assessed via the annual
percentage change using joinpoint regression and
discussed in relation to human development levels.
Results CRC incidence and mortality rates vary up to
10-fold worldwide, with distinct gradients across human
development levels, pointing towards widening
disparities and an increasing burden in countries in
transition. Generally, CRC incidence and mortality rates
are still rising rapidly in many low-income and middle-
income countries; stabilising or decreasing trends tend to
be seen in highly developed countries where rates
remain among the highest in the world.
Conclusions Patterns and trends in CRC incidence and
mortality correlate with present human development
levels and their incremental changes might reflect the
adoption of more western lifestyles. Targeted resource-
dependent interventions, including primary prevention in
low-income, supplemented with early detection in high-
income settings, are needed to reduce the number of
patients with CRC in future decades.
INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most com-
monly
diagnosed
malignancy
and
the
fourth
leading
cause
of
cancer
death
in
the
world,
accounting for about 1.4 million new cases and
almost 700 000 deaths in 2012.1 The distribution
of CRC burden varies widely, with more than
two-thirds of all cases and about 60% of all deaths
occurring in countries with a high or very high
human development index (HDI).1 CRC is consid-
ered one of the clearest markers of the cancer tran-
sition,
replacing
infection-related
cancers
in
countries undergoing rapid societal and economic
changes together with other cancers predominantly
linked to western lifestyles, which are already fre-
quently found in high-income countries.2–4
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most
commonly diagnosed malignancy and the
fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
the world, and its burden is expected to
increase by 60% to more than 2.2 million new
cases and 1.1 million cancer deaths by 2030.
▸ CRC is considered one of the clearest markers
of the cancer transition, whereby countries
undergoing rapid societal and economic
changes show rapid increases in cancers
already more frequent in high-income
countries.
▸ Understanding the current patterns of CRC and
its evolution from an international perspective
is imperative in order to direct future prospects
of reducing the burden through cancer
prevention and cancer care.
What are the new findings?
▸ CRC incidence and mortality rates vary widely
worldwide, with distinct gradients across
human development levels and trends point
towards widening disparities and an increasing
burden in countries in transition.
▸ We identified three patterns of CRC incidence
and mortality trends and ascertained that CRC
incidence and mortality rates are still rising
rapidly in many low-income and middle-income
countries, linked to ongoing societal and
economic development; stabilising or
decreasing trends tend to be seen only in
highly developed countries where rates remain
among the highest in the world.
How might it impact on clinical practice in
the foreseeable future?
▸ Without targeted resource-dependent actions
based on this evidence, the number of patients
with CRC will continue to increase in future
decades.
▸ Improvements in treatment options and
accessibility are vital, particularly in low-income
and middle-income countries that face an
increasing burden of CRC.
▸ Prioritisation of primary prevention and early
detection are necessary, alongside their
integration into existing healthcare plans.

 Rapid increases in both CRC incidence and mortality are
now observed in many medium-to-high HDI countries particu-
larly in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America.2 In contrast,
CRC incidence and mortality rates have been stabilising or
declining in a number of the highest indexed HDI countries:
the
USA,
Australia,
New
Zealand
and
several
W
estern
European countries.2 The reasons for the recent declining
trends in incidence in these countries are ill-defined and likely
numerous but may partially reflect increased early detection
and prevention through polypectomy (at least in the USA).
Together with the factors that have brought about declines in
incidence, improvements in perioperative care, as well as
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, will have contributed to the
uniformly decreasing trends in CRC mortality in many high-
income settings.5 6
Given the temporal profiles and demographic projections,
the global burden of CRC is expected to increase by 60% to
more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.1 million cancer deaths
by 2030.1 Understanding the current patterns of CRC and its
evolution
from
an
international
perspective
is
therefore
imperative, and in this study, we describe the geographical var-
iations in CRC incidence and mortality in 184 countries and
time trends in 37 countries, linking the findings to the future
prospects of reducing the burden through cancer prevention
and care.
METHODS
Incidence and mortality estimates of malignant neoplasms of the
colon and rectum (ICD-10 C18-21) by country for 184 coun-
tries in 2012 were extracted from the GLOBOCAN database.1
Data on HDI for the same year were obtained from the United
Nations Development Programme.7
T
o assess time trends in CRC incidence and mortality, we
used data from two different sources with the requirement of at
least 15 consecutive years of data, and the availability of both
incidence and mortality data for each country included. For
CRC incidence, data series from high-quality regional and
national population-based cancer registries were extracted from

males in 2012 (GLOBOCAN 20121).

data
from
European countries,9 10 11 Australia,12 New Zealand,13 and the
USA14 for more recent years. Of the 37 countries studied,
national incidence data were available for 25 countries. For the
remaining countries, data from regional registries were pooled
to obtain a proxy of the national incidence (see online supple-
mentary annex table S1). National mortality data series were
extracted from the WHO mortality database, with the minimal
inclusion criteria set at the WHO-defined medium data quality
level, ensuring a reasonable degree of population coverage, com-
pleteness and accuracy.15 Rates were age-standardised (ASR) to
the world standard population.16
To analyse incidence and mortality trends, we used joinpoint
regression,17 which involves fitting a series of joined straight
lines to ASR trends. A logarithmic transformation of the rates,
calculation of SEs using the binomial approximation, and a
maximum number of three joinpoints were specified as options
in the analysis. To estimate the magnitude and direction of
recent trends, we calculated the average annual percentage
change (AAPC) and the corresponding 95% CI for the last avail-
able 10 years. The AAPC is a geometrically weighted average of
the different annual percentage changes from the joinpoint
trend analysis, for which weights are equal to the length of each
segment during the specified time interval.
RESULTS
Incidence and mortality patterns of CRC in 2012
In 2012, the estimated incidence rates in males varied from <5
(per 100 000) in several African countries to over 40 in certain
countries in Europe, Northern America and Oceania (figure 1).
The highest rates in males were observed in Slovakia (61.6),
Hungary (58.9) and the Republic of Korea (58.7), while the
lowest were seen in sub-Saharan Africa, in The Gambia and
Mozambique (both 1.5 per 100 000). Geographical patterns
were very similar between the sexes, although rates in females
tended to be lower (25% less) than their male counterparts
(data not shown, see ref.
1). Gradients in incidence were
observed with increasing levels of HDI: incidence rates in coun-
tries with a very high HDI were six times greater than countries
with a low HDI (figure 2A). Geographical patterns of CRC
mortality rates generally followed those of incidence, although
the highest rates observed tended to be in countries with high
rather than very high HDI in Central and Eastern Europe and
Latin America (figure 1). As with incidence, mortality showed a
distinct gradient across HDI levels (figure 2B), while compari-
sons of incidence-to-mortality revealed higher case fatalities
among countries indexed with lower levels of HDI.
Trends in incidence and mortality from CRC
Based on temporal characteristics of incidence and mortality
(in males), three different groups of countries were identified
(table 1): those with increasing or stable incidence and mortal-
ity (group 1, n=14 countries), those with increasing incidence
and decreasing mortality (group 2, n=14 countries) and those
with decreasing incidence and mortality (group 3, n=9 coun-
tries). The results are presented according to these three
categories.
Group 1: increasing incidence and mortality
Increases in both incidence and mortality over the most recent
10-year period were seen in this group, comprising several
Eastern European countries, and also in populations in Latin
America and Asia (see figures 3A and 4A/B; online supplemen-
tary annex tables S2 and S3). In males, the largest increases in
incidence were seen in Brazil (AAPC 7.2, 95% CI −7.5 to 24.2),
Costa Rica (3.6, 95% CI 3.1 to 4.2) and Bulgaria (3.6, 95% CI
3.1 to 4.2), while mortality rates rose most rapidly in the
Philippines (5.7, 95% CI 4.7 to 6.7) and Belarus (3.4, 95% CI
2.5 to 4.3). Incidence uniformly rose in all countries within this
group, while mortality rates appeared to level off in Bulgaria,
Russia, Croatia, Spain, Latvia and Estonia. Trends in females
were similar to those in males, although both incidence and
mortality were generally lower except in Latin American coun-
tries (Brazil, Costa Rica and Colombia), where rates in males
and females were quite similar.

 Group 2: increasing incidence and decreasing mortality
In this group, incidence rates continued to increase while mor-
tality rates decline, an observation seen in several European
countries, and also in Canada and Singapore (see figures 3B and
4A/B; online supplementary annex tables S2 and S3). The rate
of increase in incidence in males was marked in Southern
European countries including Slovenia (2.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 5.0),
Malta (1.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 2.9) and Italy (1.7, 95% CI 1.5 to
1.9), while stable or slight rises in trends were observed in
Northern European countries and in Canada. Although mortal-
ity rates decreased most remarkably in Ireland (−2.1, 95% CI
−2.9 to −1.3) and Denmark (−1.9, 95% CI −2.3 to −1.6), the
corresponding incidence rates remained constant during the
most recent 10-year period. As declining mortality rates were
also observed in the UK (−2.0, 95% CI −2.2 to −1.8), these
were, however, paralleled by a significant average increase of
1.3% per year in incidence. T
rends were similar in both sexes.
Group 3: decreasing incidence and mortality
Decreases in both CRC incidence and mortality in this group
were restricted to the highest HDI countries such as Australia,
Iceland, New Zealand and Japan (see figures 3C and 4A/B;
online supplementary annex tables S2 and S3). While the mag-
nitude of declining incidence in males were marked among US
Whites (AAPC −3.0, 95% CI −3.3 to −2.7) and Blacks (−2.2,
95% CI −3.3 to −1.0), mortality declines were greatest (−4.6%
per annum) in the Czech Republic. Again, patterns were similar
for males and females.
DISCUSSION

and trends in the overall CRC incidence and mortality world-
wide. CRC incidence and mortality rates varied widely, with

 distinct gradients across HDI levels. W
e identified three patterns
of CRC incidence and mortality trends: (1) increases in both
incidence and mortality in the most recent decade, as observed
in rapidly transitioning countries (eg, medium and high HDI
countries including those in the Baltics, as well as Russia, China
and
Brazil),
(2)
increases
in
incidence,
with
concomitant
decreases in mortality, as seen in very high HDI countries
including
Canada,
UK,
Denmark
and
Singapore
and
(3)
decreases in both incidence and mortality, as observed in a
number of the highest HDI-indexed countries including the
USA, Japan and France.
The mortality declines observed in latter two groups affect
both sexes and have been previously reported in North America
(the USA and Canada5
18), Oceania (Australia and New
Zealand),
most
European
countries
(other
than
Croatia,
Romania, Latvia, Estonia and Russia) and Asia ( Japan).2 These
can partly be linked to improving survival through the adoption
of best practices in cancer treatment and management for
CRC.19 20 Removal of polyps and early detection efforts,21–24
including the adoption of colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy,
CT colonography, faecal immunochemistry testing and faecal
occult blood testing, may be responsible for the rest of the
observed trends. The introduction of screening tests may ini-
tially increase CRC incidence rates due to the detection of
undiagnosed disease but has been shown to reduce incidence
longer term due to the removal of precancerous polyps during
colonoscopy.24 This may be particularly pertinent in explaining
the uniformly decreasing mortality trends in the USA, Israel and
Japan, countries where organised screening and early detection
programmes have been established since the 1990s.25 However,
the extent to which screening interventions are responsible for
the recent reduction in incidence rates in these countries, rela-
tive to a reduction in risk via a changing prevalence and distri-
bution of the key risk factors, is difficult to clarify at present.
Other high-income countries have introduced organised screen-
ing practices very recently; it is however unlikely that screening
has materially influenced recent incidence trends in these
countries.
The presence of birth cohort effects implies the importance
of changing risk in successive generations in contributing to the
recent plateau or declines in incidence observed in certain very
high HDI countries without long-standing organised screening
programmes, most notably Australia, New Zealand and several
European countries.26 Certainly, changes in the prevalence of
lifestyle-related factors linked to the extent of ‘westernisation’
are likely to be, in part, responsible for the global variation in
CRC incidence as well as the observed increasing incidence
trends in countries in transition in groups (1) and (2). These
modifiable risk factors include alcohol consumption,27–29 poor
diet (low consumption of fruits and vegetables, and high con-
sumption of red/processed meats),30–36 obesity,37
38 physical
inactivity39 40 and smoking.41–43 Despite higher relative risks,
family history of CRC44 and IBD45 accounts for only a small
proportion of the observed variation of CRC burden globally
given their lower prevalence. Established protective factors that
could partly explain stabilising of incidence rates in high-income
countries include the regular use of aspirin,46 47 the use of oes-
trogens after menopause48 and possibly vitamin D intake.49
Dietary patterns and the overall composition of diet have
shifted dramatically over the past half-century, with distinct dif-
ferences within world regions and individual countries. In
Japan, for example, cereal consumption decreased sharply and
vegetable consumption remained almost stable since the 1950s
until 1990.50 In contrast, meat and fat intake increased sharply
from the mid-1950s until the early-1970s to mid-1970s. The
slow increase until the last decade has been met with marked
concomitant increases in both colon cancer incidence and
mortality during the years 1990–2000.51 The rapid transition
in
income
and
economic
growth
in
low-income
and
middle-income countries has shifted dietary patterns towards an
increased
intake
of fat,
sugar and
animal-source foods.52
Changes in the food environment including access to cheaper
‘junk’ food were also paralleled by reductions in physical activ-
ity and increases in sedentary behaviour, fuelled by both
increases in overweight and obesity and changes in the built
environment.53
Increases in mortality have been reported in several countries
in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia,54 55 and these may
reflect limited health infrastructure and poorer access to early
detection and treatment.56 Survival from CRC depends heavily
on the stage at diagnosis,57–59 and the unfavourable distribution
of advanced cancers in low-income and middle-income coun-
tries may explain the higher M:I ratios as well as increases in
mortality in these countries. For colon cancer, typically the
tumour and corresponding lymph vessels are removed during
surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is administered to patients
at high risk of relapse.60 As for rectal cancer, complete removal
of the mesorectum is the standard surgical procedure that has
been shown to increase survival and substantially decrease the
risk of recurrence.60 61 In addition, typically a combination of
(neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy is administered,
whereby the recommended regimen depends heavily on the
tumour type and stage at diagnosis. Yet, in low-income settings
such as sub-Saharan Africa, surgery is often the only available
treatment option and adjunctive therapy often not available.62
Among all patients with cancer receiving radiotherapy in low-
income and middle-income countries only 1.3% and 3.1%
received radiotherapy for cancers of the colon and rectum,
respectively, while the ‘optimum’ proportion should have been
14% and 61%, respectively.58 Furthermore, delays in diagnosis,
referral and treatment and also cultural beliefs and financial con-
straints, for example, in rural areas of Latin America, may
explain part of the higher mortality in this region.62 63
This study has a number of strengths and limitations. W
e have
aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of geographical var-
iations of both CRC incidence and mortality in 2012 by sex and
the corresponding trends in both indicators in 37 countries.
Attention should be drawn to lack of availability of recorded
(registry) incidence and mortality data (particularly in low-
income and middle-income countries) in deriving national inci-
dence and mortality estimates in 184 countries as part of our
GLOBOCAN compilation; only one-third and one-fifth of the
world’s countries presently report high-quality incidence and
mortality data, respectively. For the trends analyses, we used
CI5 data of high comparability, completeness and validity to
assess trends in incidence. In using national mortality, we used
only data with at least WHO-defined medium levels of com-
pleteness and coverage.
The intention was to provide a global snapshot of the scale
and profile of CRC today, using high-quality data wherever
possible. This study serves as a pointer to show how the
disease burden is likely to develop in low-income countries in
the longer term and highlights the pressing need for cancer
control action to halt the rising mortality rates in many low-
income and middle-income countries. While the scope of this
study necessitates a general approach, the main weakness stems
from a lack of granularity in the analyses. W
e have not
included here a separate assessment of colon and rectal cancer,

 nor did we examine variations in distal (left-sided) cancers of
the rectosigmoid junction and proximal (right-sided) cancers of
the
descending
and
sigmoid
colon,
despite
many studies
reporting a rising proportion of the latter tumours. The inclu-
sion of birth cohort analyses would also have led to a more
robust assessment of the recent direction of trends enabling
the generation of hypotheses linked to the changing prevalence
of causative factors in successive cohorts and the impact of
early-stage
factors
and
early-in-life
experiences,
and
their
further study will increase our understanding of the aetiology
of this cancer.
Diverse global CRC patterns and trends point towards widen-
ing disparities and an increasing burden in countries in transi-
tion. Generally, CRC incidence and mortality rates correlate
with the adoption of a western lifestyle; while they are still
rising rapidly in many low-income and middle-income countries
linked to ongoing societal and economic development, in highly
developed
countries,
rates
are
stabilising
or
decreasing.
Decreases in incidence (also seen in recent birth cohorts) in high
HDI and high-risk countries are likely driven by changes in life-
style and dietary patterns over the past decades, which might
translate into further future rate declines as these cohorts age.
Early detection and screening might have led to short-term
increases in incidence, but such interventions will eventually
contribute to mortality reductions through the increased detec-
tion of early-stage tumours.
The fact that CRC has replaced infection-related cancers as
the second most common cancer in several middle-income
countries (particularly among women) highlights the major chal-
lenge of CRC control in countries undergoing significant socio-
economic transition, and the importance of continued efforts to
monitor trends in CRC incidence, mortality and survival world-
wide. Without targeted resource-dependent actions based on
this evidence, the number of patients with CRC will continue to
increase in future decades beyond those already projected as a
result
of
population
ageing
and
population
growth.

 Improvements in treatment options and accessibility, including
tertiary care, are vital in low-income and middle-income coun-
tries that face an increasing burden of CRC. In light of the
limited capacity for health service provision and associated
costs, however, there remains an overwhelming need to priori-
tise and integrate primary prevention and early detection mea-
sures into existing healthcare plans.64
