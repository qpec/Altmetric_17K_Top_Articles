Abstract
Given the proportion of individuals with resistance to, and poor compliance or tolerance of, anti-
hypertensive medication new drugs to treat this syndrome are required urgently. We show that 
peripheral chemoreceptors generate aberrant signalling contributing to high blood pressure in 
hypertension and thus reveal a novel target. We discovered that P2x3 receptor mRNA expression 
was up regulated substantially in chemoreceptive petrosal sensory neurones in hypertensive rats. 
These neurones generated both tonic drive and hyperreflexia in hypertensive (but not normotensive 
rats), and both phenomena were normalised by blockade of P2X3 receptors. Antagonism of P2X3 
receptors also reduced arterial pressure and basal sympathetic activity and normalised carotid body 
hyperreflexia in conscious hypertensive rats; no effect was observed in normotensive rats. These 
preclinical data support the P2X3 receptor as a putative novel target for controlling human

 hypertension, a notion supported by our evidence of both P2X3 receptor expression in 
hypertensive human carotid body and the revelation of its hyperactivity.
Introduction
One third of the human population is hypertensive. In the USA, despite 75% of individuals 
using anti-hypertensive medication only 53% (~41 million) have blood pressure controlled1. 
This may, in part, reflect the significant drug adherence problem due to the asymptomatic 
nature of hypertension and the poorly tolerated side-effects of current medication. 
Significant savings in healthcare costs are predicted if blood pressure was reduced to 
<140/90 mm Hg2. The clear evidence that a 10 mmHg rise in diastolic BP >115/75 mm Hg 
doubles the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in adults over 40 years3. Further, at 
least 8% of an estimated 900 million hypertensive humans worldwide4 currently have 
developed drug-resistance5,6. Categorically, there remains an unmet clinical need for 
controlling blood pressure.
Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, was the last anti-hypertensive drug introduced in 2007. This was 
the first new drug for thirteen years, yet its efficacy beyond the existing renin-angiotensin–
aldosterone enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers is questionable, and associated adverse 
effects question its long-term benefit-harm relationship7. The paucity of novel 
pharmacological anti-hypertensives has led to a series of device based interventional studies 
including renal denervation8, stimulation of carotid baroreceptors9, deep brain stimulation10 
and arterial venous anastomosis11,12. Here, we introduce a novel mechanistic approach using 
a highly selective small molecule antagonist, and provide the pre-clinical and clinical data 
that justifies its use in a future clinical trial in hypertension.
Currently the carotid body is being considered as a novel therapeutic target for 
cardiovascular disease: (i) the carotid body chemoreflex-evoked sympathoexcitatory 
response is potentiated in both a pre-clinical model of hypertension - the spontaneously 
hypertensive (SH) rat - and humans with hypertension13–18; (ii) denervation of the carotid 
body is evidently an effective way to control both the development and maintenance of high 
blood pressure in the SH rat19,20. We concluded that in conditions of hypertension the 
carotid body chemoreceptors generate aberrant excitatory tone driving up sympathetic 
activity and causing high blood pressure14,21. We found that by switching off this carotid 
body tone using either hyperoxia or nerve section to disconnect the carotid body from the 
brain, arterial pressure and sympathetic activity were reduced in SH rats, but were 
unaffected in a normotensive strain14. In hypertensive human, hyperoxia lowered 
sympathetic activity18 and carotid body resection can reduce arterial pressure22. Thus, the 
animal and human data support the presence of aberrant carotid body discharge contributing 
to hypertension. Although the mechanistic basis for the carotid body aberrant tone is 
unknown, it may be pivotal for refining new pharmacological anti-hypertensive approaches 
as we propose here.
It is acknowledged that a plethora of mechanisms governs carotid body signalling23–27. We 
have considered in our current investigations the ATP gated ion channels (called purinergic 
P2X receptors), specifically the C-fiber localised P2X3 receptor subtypes, which are

 commonly associated with afferent sensitisation, and that apparently may contribute to 
hyperreflexic disease states in a variety of organs28,29. ATP is one of a number of 
transmitters involved in the transduction process of hypoxia in the carotid body30–35. P2X3 
receptor expression is present in both carotid bodies and petrosal ganglia neurones of 
normotensive rats36. Moreover, combined P2X2 and P2X3 subunit deletion reduced the 
ventilatory response to hypoxia in mice37. We hypothesised that P2X3 receptors contribute 
to both the chemo-hyper reflexia and aberrant discharge of carotid body activity in 
hypertension and predict that their blockade would cause an anti-hypertensive effect. To 
address this, we have used highly selective P2X3 receptor antagonists. Herein, we 
demonstrate the translatability of our pre-clinical findings to hypertensive humans.
Results
Hyperactivity of carotid bodies in hypertensive rats
Carotid body afferent discharge was recorded from the carotid sinus nerve of the in situ 
preparation. Both basal discharge and chemoreflex evoked volleys (NaCN used to simulate 
hypoxia, 15–30 μg i.a.) were elevated in hypertensive versus normotensive rats (SH vs. 
Wistar: basal, 24.9 ± 2 vs 1.4 ± 0.3 spikes/s, respectively, P < 0.001; chemoreflex, 62.3 ± 3 
vs 28.3 ± 2 spikes/s, respectively; P < 0.001, Fig. 1a – c). Next, low dose dopamine was used 
to inhibit carotid body discharge39. In SH rats in vivo, dopamine infusion (10 μg/kg/min i.v. 
as per39) depressed respiration, an effect not observed in Wistar rats (Fig. 1d), indicating the 
presence of carotid body tonicity in the hypertensive animals. Intracellular recordings 
revealed that physiologically characterised chemoreceptive primary afferent petrosal 
ganglion neurones from hypertensive rats in situ were more depolarised (−51.5 ± 0.9 vs 
−55.7 ± 1 mV; P < 0.001, Fig. 2a,c and Supplementary Fig. 1a), exhibited tonic firing (1.5 
± 0.8 vs 0 Hz; Fig. 2a) and displayed an enhanced chemoreflex evoked firing response to an 
equivalent dose of sodium cyanide (22.5 μg) compared to normotensive rats (123 ± 5 vs. 52 
± 3 spikes; P < 0.001, Fig. 2a,d). In sum, compared to the normotensive rat, the carotid body 
of SH rats is hyperactive generating both aberrant tone and hyperreflexia.
Chemoreceptive petrosal neurone excitability in SH rats
We next compared the electrical excitability of chemoreceptive petrosal neurones and found 
that SH rats exhibited enhanced excitability to injected current pulses; for example, a 1nA 
current pulse evoked 25 ± 1.1 spikes vs 15 ± 1.7 spikes in Wistar rats (Supplementary Fig. 
2a,b, n = 6; P < 0.05). Neither the membrane input resistance of these cells (119 ± 3 vs 117 
± 9 MΩ; Supplementary Fig. 1c) nor whole cell capacitance was different between rat strains 
(Supplementary Fig. 1d).
Normalizing petrosal neurone excitability in SH rats
As P2X3 receptors are found in the carotid body of normotensive rats36 and associated with 
pathological afferent sensitisation in numerous other organs28,29,33 we assessed whether they 
were involved in carotid body dysfunction in SH rats in situ. In SH rats, focal delivery via a 
glass micropipette inserted into the ipsilateral carotid body of a highly selective non-
competitive P2X3 receptor antagonist (AF-353; 15 nl, 20 μM40) caused hyperpolarisation 
(−9.9 ± 2.1 mV; n = 12, P < 0.001, Fig. 2b,c), total abolition of ongoing activity (Fig. 2b)

 and reduced chemoreflex sensitivity of petrosal chemoreceptive neurones (from 123 ± 5 to 
34 ± 2 spikes; n = 12, P < 0.001, Fig. 2b,d). In normotensive animals in situ, AF-353 also 
caused hyperpolarisation (−4.4 ± 1.8 mV; n = 10, P < 0.001, Fig. 2c) and reduced the 
chemoreflex evoked volley from 52 ± 3 to 32 ± 2 spikes; n = 10, P < 0.001, Fig. 2b,d). Both 
the magnitude of the hyperpolarisation and reduction in chemoreflex evoked spiking were 
greater in SH versus Wistar rats (P < 0.001, Fig. 2c,d). Notably, after P2X3 receptor 
antagonism, carotid body activation yielded comparable firing responses in petrosal 
neurones between rat strains (SH: 34 vs. Wistar 32 spikes; NS), which was reversible in SH 
rats (Fig. 2b). After AF-353 treatment the intrinsic firing response to injected depolarising 
current pulses was reduced in SH (e.g. at 1 nA: 25 ± 1 to 19 ± 1 spikes; P < 0.05, 
Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) but not Wistar rat neurones (15 ± 2 to 12 ± 2, NS). We next tested 
whether P2X3 receptors were upregulated in SH rat petrosal neurones.
Upregulated P2X3 receptors in petrosal neurones of SH rats
Single cell PCR analysis of characterised chemoreceptive petrosal ganglion neurones 
recorded from SH rats in situ revealed a >4 fold up regulation of P2x3 receptor mRNA 
relative to Wistar rats (Fig. 2e,f; n = 6, P < 0.001); this was confirmed at the protein level 
using western blot performed on carotid bodies (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, no change was found 
in P2x3 (or P2x2) receptor mRNA expression in non-chemoreceptive petrosal neurones 
(Supplementary Fig. 2e) indicative of specificity to chemoreflex neurones. There was no rat 
strain related change in: P2x2 receptor (Fig. 2f) and tyrosine hydroxylase (a known marker 
of glomus cells) mRNA expression in petrosal chemoreceptive neurones of SH rats 
(Supplementary Fig. 2c) or in chemoreceptive neurones located in the nucleus tractus 
solitarii (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Fig. 3b shows co-localisation of P2X3 receptors with 
tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive glomus cells (and axons, Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). 
Based on the up regulation of P2x3 receptors in the petrosal neurones of SH rats, we tested 
whether there was a difference in sensitivity of these neurones to ATP between the rat 
strains.
Sensitisation of SH rat chemoreceptive petrosal cells to ATP
Application (15 nl) of ATP or α–β–methylene-ATP focally to the carotid body produced 
dose-dependent increases in the firing and membrane depolarisation of petrosal neurones. 
Notably, the petrosal neurones in the SH rat were more sensitive than those from Wistar rats: 
for ATP the EC50% SH vs Wistar rat was 8.8 ± 2.2 vs 17.2 ± 1.3 (P < 0.001; Fig. 3c,d) and 
for α–β–methylene-ATP the EC50% SH vs Wistar rat was 9.4 ± 2.1 vs 16.2 ± 2.4 (P < 0.05; 
Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). These findings were consistent with greater P2X3 receptor-
sensitive inward current evoked by ATP in chemoreceptive petrosal neurones (Fig. 3e,f). 
Next, we tested if antagonism of carotid body P2X3 receptors lowered arterial blood 
pressure in SH rats.
Blocking P2X3 receptors systemically is anti-hypertensive
One hour infusions of a highly selective non-competitive P2X3 receptor antagonist,AF-219, 
were made at 1, 4 and 8 mg/kg/h, i.v. This compound was preferred to the structurally 
related, more lipophilic antagonist AF-353, as AF-219 has been used clinically for other 
indications in humans29, and since it does not cross the blood brain barrier significantly its

 use in vivo was preferable. We performed a PK analysis to assess plasma concentrations in 
SH rats (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 5) and subsequently correlated these with the falls 
in systolic blood pressure (Fig. 4a). In SH rats, basal arterial pressure was 151±3/109±3 
(SBP/DBP) mmHg. AF-219 produced dose182 dependent falls in arterial pressure (Fig. 4a); 
no response was observed in Wistar rats (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 6). At a dose of 
8mg/kg/h SBP/DBP in SH rats fell by - 28±3/−26±4 mmHg (Fig. 4a; n = 7, P < 0.001). 
Heart rate and respiratory frequency also decreased (by −38±8 and −12±3/min, respectively; 
Supplementary Fig. 6, n = 7, P < 0.01). Interestingly, after carotid body resection a residual 
fall of −17±3 mmHg in SBP persisted with AF-219 infusion in SH rats (30 min, 8mg/kg/h; 
Fig. 4b, n = 7, P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 7). The chemoreflex evoked increase in arterial 
pressure in conscious SH rats was also reduced after systemic blockade of P2X3 receptors 
by AF-219 (bolus doses given i.v. >1 mg/kg; n = 4, P < 0.05; Fig. 4c). We next determined 
the mechanisms by which arterial pressure was lowered in SH rats by P2X3 receptor 
blockade.
P2X3 receptor blocker reduces sympathetic tone in SH rats
We evaluated the effect of P2X3 receptor antagonism on cardiovascular autonomic activity. 
Ongoing basal levels of thoracic SNA recorded in situ were reduced from 20.8±2.2 to 
13.7±2.5 μV (Fig. 5a–c; n = 12, P < 0.001) following focal delivery of AF-353 (15 nl, 20 
μM) to carotid bodies bilaterally in SH rats. This reduced value was similar to levels in 
normotensive rats either before (12.3±2.6 μV) or after AF-353 application (11.7±2.3 μV, 
Fig. 5c; n = 12, NS). Chemoreflex evoked increases in expiratory modulated SNA were 
209±12% and 131±11% for SH and Wistar rats respectively, and after AF-353 were reduced 
significantly to 76±11% and 69±7.8% in SH and Wistar rats, respectively (Fig. 5a–e, n = 12, 
P < 0.001); these new basal values were not different to one another. Following drug 
washout, the depressant effects on SNA was reversed (basal and reflex evoked; Fig. 5b).
We replicated these data using TNP-ATP (Supplementary Fig. 8). a high affinity, non208 
selective P2X receptor antagonist that inhibits P2X1, P2X3 and heteromeric P2X2/3 with a 
1000-fold selectivity over P2X2, P2X4 and P2X7 receptors that is structurally distinct to 
AF-353. This evidence supports AF-353 blocking P2X3 homomeric and P2X2/3 
heterotrimeric receptors rather than non-selective actions on ionic conductances and/or other 
receptors.
Recordings were made from renal sympathetic nerves using radio-telemetry in conscious SH 
rats in vivo during chronic systemic P2X3 receptor antagonism using AF-219. This reduced 
both the basal renal sympathetic activity (−37±13 normalised units relative to baseline, Fig. 
5f; P < 0.05) and the chemoreflex evoked increase in renal sympathetic activity (Fig. 5g,h; P 
< 0.05). Spontaneous renal sympathetic baroreflex gain was enhanced after AF-219 
(0.14±0.07 vs 0.01±0.02 %.mmHg−1; P < 0.05) but not vehicle infusion. Although no 
changes in autonomic activity to the heart were detected in conscious SH rats after AF-219 
infusion (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b), spontaneous cardiac baroreflex was increased 
(0.13±0.04 to 0.27±0.05 ms/mmHg, Supplementary Fig. 9c; P < 0.001). We next tested the 
translatability of the SH rat data and potential use of P2X3 receptor antagonist in human 
hypertension.

 Translating carotid body P2X3 receptors to human hypertension
If P2X3 receptors within the carotid body are to be considered a novel anti228 hypertensive 
target in humans, then evidence for their presence and pharmacokinetics of suitable 
antagonist are essential first steps. Carotid bodies were obtained from cadavers and 
processed for P2X3 receptors immunocytochemistry (n = 5) and western blot (n = 4). P2X3 
receptor antibody specificity was determined (Supplementary Fig. 10). P2X3 receptor 
expression was prevalent in human carotid body (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 11a) 
showing co-expression with tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for glomus cells. Axons within 
the carotid body also expressed P2X3 receptors (Supplementary Fig. 11b). This expression 
pattern was similar to that seen in the SH rat (Fig. 3b).
With the presence of P2X3 receptors in hypertensive human carotid body, we next assessed 
whether there was tonicity in the carotid body of hypertensive humans by chemical and 
reversible inactivation of it. In six hypertensive humans, minute ventilation was measured 
during low dose dopamine infusion (5 min; 2 μg/kg/min i.v.) as described previously to 
inactivate the carotid body38. A bi-phasic response in minute ventilation to dopamine was 
observed (Fig. 6c) comprising a depression (−1.28± 0.52 L/min; P < 0.05) and over shoot 
following dopamine (1.28± 0.41 L/min; P < 0.05) relative to vehicle infusion. These data 
indicate that the carotid body of hypertensive humans can generate tonic drive and that 
dopamine infusion allows identification of it.
Discussion
Many transmitter mechanisms mediating reflex responses to hypoxia have been described 
within the carotid body and may contribute to its sensitisation in disease states; these 
include: TASK and ASIC channels14,25, hydrogen sulphide23,24, carbon monoxide24, nitric 
oxide24 and carotid body blood flow27. However, in vitro studies have also shown a major 
role for ATP release from glomus cells in response to hypoxia in both rat30, cat31 and 
human35. Whether there is a link between ATP release and any of the aforementioned 
mechanisms remains an open question. Moreover, P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits were 
both found to be present in the rat carotid body36 and using co257 cultures of glomus and 
petrosal cells in vitro Nurse and colleagues demonstrated that ATP acted via P2X receptors 
to excite petrosal neurones36. This evidence was based on using suramin, a weak and non-
selective P2X antagonist. P2X2-containing channels (P2X2 homotrimers and/or P2X2/3 
heterotrimers) likely dominate the normal physiological ventilatory response to hypoxaemia 
as the P2X2 single and P2X2 + P2X3 double KO mice, but not the P2X3 single KO, showed 
ventilatory hyporeflexia37. Thus, P2X3 subunit expression changes seem associated with 
pathological sensitisation of carotid body reflexes.
In the present study, using selective antagonists, we found that both exogenous and 
endogenous ATP released from the carotid body can act on P2X3 subunit containing 
receptors on petrosal neurons. A caveat is that we cannot fully establish the relative 
contribution of homotrimeric P2X3 versus heterotrimeric P2X2/3 receptors in such 
responses, although the antagonists we used have higher affinity for P2X3 homotrimeric 
receptors28, and a P2X3 heterotrimeric upregulation in carotid body could account for 
increased ATP sensitivity per se, as this channel form in recombinant studies displays

 significantly lower EC50 values to the nucleotide40. Our voltage clamp data indicate a non-
desensitising current to α-β-methyl ATP and probable involvement of P2X3 homomeric and 
P2X2/3 heteromeric receptors. Our data provide the first evidence that P2X3 receptors in the 
carotid body play a vital role in controlling its reflex sensitivity in SH but not normotensive 
rats.
Up-regulation of P2X3 receptors in the carotid body appears, in part, causal for the aetiology 
of the tonicity, hyperreflexia of chemoreceptive petrosal neurones and downstream 
hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system in SH rats. We acknowledge that 
chemoreceptive petrosal neurones may have a larger receptive field in the carotid body of 
SH vs Wistar rats contributing to their hyperactive state. Notably, upregulated P2x3 receptor 
mRNA was exclusive to chemoreceptive petrosal neurons (i.e. not upregulated on non-
chemoreceptive petrosal cells). The carotid body tonicity we report from in situ preparations 
(1.5 Hz per petrosal neuron) most likely underestimates that in conscious SH rats as 
recordings were made in hyperoxia, a condition known to temper carotid body 
discharge14,20; this may also explain the dearth of activity in neurones recorded from Wistar 
rats. Whether P2X3 receptor up290 regulation alone is sufficient for the pathological carotid 
body signalling in the SH rat (without the need for increased ATP release or reduced ATP 
clearance) is unclear. However, given that the microvasculature of the carotid body is 
hypertrophied in the SH rat41 and the possibility that arterioles feeding the carotid body 
receive high sympathetic drive41, the tissue is likely to be hypoxic/hypercapnic – a condition 
known to induce ATP release42. Additionally, inflammation, known to be present in the 
carotid body of SH rats41, will also drive ATP release43.
The association of P2X3 receptor up-regulation and aberrant afferent signalling is not new28 
but consistent with sensitisation of visceral sensing mechanisms from, for example, the 
bladder44,45, urinary tract46, larynx29, lungs47, gastro-intestinal-tract48,49 and skeletal 
muscle50 in numerous diseased states including chronic pain51. Elucidation of the 
mechanisms controlling P2x3 receptor expression at both transcriptional and cytosolic 
trafficking levels within the carotid body and other organs now becomes an important issue 
to allow translation into the clinical arena.
The finding that P2X3 receptor activation evoked a rapidly inactivating current in vitro52 
seems inconsistent with an ability of P2X3 receptors to maintain tonic drive from the carotid 
body (or any organ). Notably, low pH, a postulated condition in the carotid body of SH rats 
(see above;41), can potentiate P2X3 receptor inward currents and reduce de310 
sensitisation53. Furthermore, the concept has been developed that P2X3 receptor activation 
may lead to local generator potentials and calcium transients in afferent terminals that lowers 
the threshold for activation by any other excitatory agent, as described in somatosensory 
nociceptor C-fibres as leading to a condition of hyperalgesic priming54,55. Such threshold 
attenuation and chemoceptive priming may be under the control of P2X3 receptor in the 
carotid body, although we do not rule out possible emergence of P2X2/3 heteromeric 
receptors, as these channels show less rapid de317 sensitisation52, which is consistent with 
our voltage clamp data (Fig. 3e,f).

 We found a robust dose-dependent lowering of arterial pressure following systemic 
administration of AF-219 in SH rats. That a fall in blood pressure was seen in rats with 
Goldblatt hypertension (W. Pijacka, F.M. McBryde & J.F.R. Paton – unpublished) suggests 
this is not restricted to the SH rat. We propose that the effect of P2X3 receptor antagonism 
is, in most part, acting within the carotid body but not exclusively as the antagonist induced 
fall in arterial pressure was substantially reduced but not abolished after carotid body 
ablation (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Further support for a direct action of the 
antagonist at the carotid body is that the fall in arterial pressure was accompanied with a 
reduction in sympathetic activity in vivo, a mechanism for the arterial pressure reduction, 
which was also found following direct injection of AF-353 into the carotid body in situ. The 
remaining residual depressor response seen with AF-219 after carotid body ablation suggests 
a contribution from other sensory afferents in which P2X3 receptors have become active. We 
propose this includes glomus tissue in the thorax and abdomen but this remains to be 
confirmed. Mechanistically, the decrease in sympathetic activity included a reduction in its 
respiratory modulation, particularly its expiratory component. It is this component that is 
upregulated in numerous models of hypertension56,57 supporting the importance of the 
central respiratory generator as a major driver of autonomic imbalance in hypertension57. 
We also found an improvement in the spontaneous cardiac baroreceptor reflex, possibly 
reflecting the removal of the inhibitory influence of the carotid body on the carotid sinus 
baroreceptor reflex as reported previously in both SH rats20 and human hypertensives58; this 
may contribute to the sympatho-inhibition and anti-hypertensive response of P2X3 receptor 
antagonism in the SH rat.
The clinical significance of the synergy of up-regulated P2X3 receptor expression in the 
carotid body and petrosal neurones with emerging pathology should not be underestimated. 
It follows that administration of a P2X3 receptor antagonist should attenuate aberrant 
signalling without affecting physiological function. Data herein supports this logic, as 
carotid body tonic drive and hyperreflexia were abated yet the system rem ained 
physiologically responsive to stimulation akin to control animals (Fig. 2b). This is entirely 
consistent with a recent human trial to treat chronic pathological cough where the latter was 
abated but physiological/protective cough reflexes did not appear to be altered29. Peripheral 
chemoreception also has both regulatory and protective reflex functions59. Simultaneously 
abolishing pathological signalling while preserving normal carotid body function with a 
P2X3 antagonist such as AF-219 is an ideal outcome clinically that would be paramount in 
drug safety and target specificity. An issue may be the known adverse effect of P2X3 
receptor antagonism affecting taste perception29 but appropriate dosing may negate this.
Over the last 20 years there has been a dearth of novel anti-hypertensive therapeutics (e.g.7). 
We speculate that P2X3 receptor antagonism may be most efficacious in a sub360 
population of uncontrolled hypertensive humans with demonstrable aberrant carotid body 
activity and an overactive sympathetic nervous system. The existence of P2X3 receptors in 
the carotid body of hypertensive human, the release of ATP from human glomus cells in 
response to hypoxia35 and the ability of dopamine to select those individuals with aberrant 
carotid body discharge (Fig. 6c) supports our contention of a translational trial to test the 
anti-hypertensive effect of P2X3 antagonism; this study now awaits commencement.

A. Animal studies
All procedures conformed to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and were 
approved by the University of Bristol ethical review committee. We used male 
spontaneously hypertensive (SH) or Wistar rats, which were bred within the animal facility 
of the University of Bristol. Animals were selected from different litters and housed with 
controlled temperature (21 ± 2 °C) and humidity (55 ± 10%). Wistar and SH rats were 
exposed to 12 hour day-night shift with unlimited access to food and water. We used rats 
either 4-5 weeks old (70-100 g) for in situ preparations or 14-16 weeks for in vivo radio-
telemetry. Power calculations were based on: determining response magnitude (arbitrarily or 
based on previous reports or pilot experiments), data variance (our previous experience, 
published papers, pilot experiments), taking into consideration number of drugs to be tested 
and drug doses, and expected technical success rate of each type of experiment. Given the 
highly technical nature and longevity of the studies it was not possible to blind them.
Arterially perfused in situ juvenile rat preparation—Male Wistar or SH rats, 4-5 
weeks, weighing 70–100 g were prepared as originally described60. In brief, rats were 
anesthetized deeply using isoflurane (5%). Anesthetic depth was assessed by a failure to 
respond to a noxious pinch of either a paw or the tail. Anesthetized rats were transected 
below the diaphragm, their upper body submerged in ice-cooled Ringer solution and 
decerebrated pre-collicularly by gentle aspiration. The preparation was skinned, transferred 
to a recording chamber and a double-lumen catheter was inserted into the descending aorta. 
One lumen was used to deliver perfusate pumped using a roller pump (Watson Marlow 
505S). The perfusate was an isosmotic Ringer solution (containing in mM: NaCl 120, 
NaHCO3 24, KCl 5, CaCl2 2.5, MgSO4 1.25, KH2PO4 1.25, glucose 10) containing an 
oncotic agent (polyethylene glycol, 1.5%; Sigma-UK), gassed with carbogen (95% O2 and 
5% CO2), warmed to 32 °C, pH 7.3 after carbogenation, and filtered using a nylon screen 
(pore size: 25 μM diameter). A side connector to this catheter allowed administration of 
drugs directly into the arterial circulation. The second lumen of the catheter was used to 
monitor aortic perfusion pressure. The left phrenic nerve was isolated and its activity (PNA) 
recorded from the cut central end using a glass suction bipolar electrode held in a 3-D 
micromanipulator. Rhythmic ramping PNA gave a continuous physiological index of 
preparation viability. After respiratory-related movements commenced, a neuromuscular 
blocker (vecuronium bromide, 40 μg.ml−1, Norcuron Organon Teknika) was added to the 
perfusate to stabilize mechanically the preparation. Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) was 
also recorded from the thoracic or lumbar sympathetic chain using a bipolar glass suction 
electrode. All nerve signals were AC-amplified, band-pass filtered (0.5 Hz−5 kHz), rectified 
and integrated and sampled at 2-5 kHz. At the end of each experiment the noise level was 
measured after application of lidocaine (2%) to the sympathetic chain; this level was 
subtracted from the integrated signal. The head of the preparation was fixed by ear bars.

 Whole cell recordings from chemoreceptive neurones—The carotid body/carotid 
sinus nerve/petrosal ganglion complex was isolated on the animal’s right side. Using 
recently described techniques57,61 whole cell patch clamp recordings of chemoreceptive 
petrosal ganglionic or NTS neurones was performed with electrodes filled with a solution 
containing the following (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 4.5 MgCl2; 14 trisphosphocreatine, 1 0 
HEPES; 5 EGTA; 4 Na-ATP; 0.3 Na-GTP; pH 7.3, and ∼300 mOsmol and had resistances 
of 3–8 MΩ when tested in bath solution. Current777 and voltage- clamp experiments were 
performed using an Axopatch-200B integrating amplifier (Molecular Devices) and pClamp 
acquisition software (version 10.0, Molecular Devices). Gigaseals (>1 GΩ) were formed, 
and whole-cell configuration was obtained by suction. To allow stable whole cell recordings, 
the petrosal ganglion was opened along its lateral aspect. A mesh grid was lowered onto the 
ganglion for stabilization, while permitting visualisation of the petrosal ganglia. We used 
electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve (the axons of petrosal neurones) to find the 
chemosensitive petrosal and NTS neurones as characterised by their excitatory response to 
sodium cyanide injected into the aorta (0.03%, 50 μl). ATP (15 nl of 0.5, 2, 10, 20, 40, 100 
mM) or α-β-methylene ATP (15 nl of 0.5, 2, 10, 20, 40, 100 mM) or AF-353 (15 nl of 20 
μM; a P2X3 receptor antagonist)40 were injected into the carotid body using a 2 μm tip 
diameter glass microelectrode attached to a picopump (Picospritzer II, Parker 
Instrumentation).
Single petrosal neurone PCR—The cytoplasm of the chemosensitive petrosal and NTS 
neurones were pulled into a patch pipette with a slight negative pressure as described 
recently61. The cytoplasm was then placed into a microtube containing High Capacity 
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit reagents (Life Technologies) and nuclease-free water for 
subsequent transcription in a thermocycler (Mastercycler Gradient, Eppendorf). A pre-
amplification of the cDNA was performed using the TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix Kit (Life 
Technologies) with the following probes: Rn04219592_g1 (P2x2), Rn00579301_m1 (P2x3), 
TH: Rn00562500_m1, Post-synaptic density-95: Rn00571479_m1 and β-Actin: 
NM_031144.2 (reference gene). The pre-amplification protocol consisted of a hold 
temperature at 95°C during 10 minutes and 14 cycles of 95°C and 60°C during 15 s and 14 
minutes, respectively. The reactions for the single-cell qRT-PCR were performed in 
singleplex and triplicate (StepOnePlus System, Applied Biosystems) using the same probes 
described above and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix kit (Life Technologies) 
according to the manufacture’s recommendations. Water was used instead of cDNA as a 
negative control. β-actin was used as a control gene to normalise the reactions. The relative 
quantitation was determined by the ΔΔCt method. For each sample, the threshold cycle (Ct) 
was determined and normalised to the average of the housekeeping genes 
. The fold change of mRNA content in the sample of 
petrosal neurones from SHR relative to the Wistar group was determined by 
, where 
. Data are presented as mRNA expression relative to the 
Wistar group. Dual probing of mRNA included: TH and PSD-95 in 11 petrosal 
chemoreceptive cells from Wistar rats; TH and PSD-95 in 9 petrosal chemoreceptive cells 
from SHR; P2x2 and P2x3 receptor expression in 6 petrosal chemoreceptive cells from 
Wistar and 5 petrosal chemoreceptive cells from SHR.

 In vivo blood pressure and renal nerve monitoring—Most surgical techniques were 
described previously20. Rats were anaesthetised with ketamine (100mg/ml; Vetalar, Zoetis, 
London, UK)/medetomidine hydrochloride (1 mg/ml Domitor, Elanco Animal Health, 
Hampshire, UK) injected intra muscularly. For blood pressure recording only, an incision 
was made in the midline of the abdomen and the abdominal aorta was exposed and 
cannulated just above the iliac bifurcation. The cannula of the transmitter (PA-C40; DSI, 
USA) was inserted until the tip rested just below the left renal artery branch point, and held 
in place using a tissue adhesive (VetBond, 3M, USA) and cellulose matrix. The transmitter 
body was placed in the abdominal cavity. Animals were allowed a seven days recovery 
period. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic, was administered for 3 to 5 days 
postoperatively (0.006 mg/100g of Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany). Some rats 
were fitted with heparinised (TDMAC, Plolysciences Inc., Eppelheim, Germany) catheters 
placed into right jugular and left femoral vein for blood sampling and drug infusions, 
respectively. The catheter placed in the right jugular vein was perforated according to the 
protocol62. Animals were allowed five days recovery post vein catheterisation. Catheters 
were flushed with heparinised saline solution (0.9 % Saline/100U Heparin) every other day 
in order to maintain their patency.
For renal nerve recording, rats were implanted with telemetric devices (TRM56SP; Millar 
Inc, Houston, Texas, USA). Details for blood pressure procedures are given above. For renal 
nerve recording, the right renal artery was exposed via a retroperitoneal approach, the renal 
nerves gently freed from surrounding connective tissue and a small piece of parafilm placed 
underneath. The renal nerve(s) were then lifted over bipolar silver wire recording electrodes, 
isolated with a biocompatible silicone elastomer (Kiwk-Sil, WPI, Eu), and the nerve/
electrode complex secured in place using tissue adhesive and cellulose mesh. The incision 
was closed, and rats recovered for at least seven days post-operatively, with analgesic 
treatment for 3 days (buprenorphine, 0.01 mg/kg per dose).
Experimental protocols for in vivo rat studies—These studies were repeated by two 
researchers working independently. Drug infusions (i.v.) were carried out in rats housed 
singularly. Animals were acclimatised to experimental environment for at least 2 hours. At 
this time blood pressure remained stable. AF-219 was dissolved in 0.9% saline containing 
10 mM HCl (vehicle). In some animals in which arterial blood pressure was measured, a PK 
analysis of AF-219 was performed by withdrawing blood from the jugular catheter at two 
time points: one hour from the start of infusion and one hour post infusion. Rats received an 
infusion of vehicle and 1, 4 and 8 mg/kg/h AF-219 for 60 minutes at 5 ml/kg/h into their 
femoral vein followed by a 60 minute washout period. Administration order of the drug 
doses and vehicle was randomized. These doses were selected by modelling 
pharmacokinetic data to obtain a pharmacokinetic profile in rats similar to that achievable in 
humans. The modelling was validated by quantifying AF-219 plasma concentrations after 
the 60 minute infusion period by using an HPLC-MS/MS assay and stable-labelled AF-219 
as internal standard. The peripheral chemoreflex was tested with sodium cyanide (0.1 ml 
bolus i.v. 0.04% NaCN; BDH, Poole, UK, flushed with 0.9% saline (0.1 ml)). A bolus 
injection of sodium cyanide (0.04% in 0.1 ml) was given 45 minutes before, and 60 and 90 
minutes after the beginning of the infusion to check for chemoreflex sensitivity. Rats were

 allowed 24 hour recovery between vehicle/drug and each drug dose. Infusions were carried 
using a standard syringe pump (Harvard apparatus, MA, USA). Dopamine hydrochloride 
was infused (10 μg/kg/min; Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Dorset, UK) to reversibly 
inactivate carotid bodies and assess their tonicity by measuring arterial pressure, heart rate 
and respiratory frequency.
Rats tested with NaCN and dopamine hydrochloride underwent selective bilateral carotid 
body resection. Via a midline incision through the skin on the ventral surface of the neck, 
and using a binocular dissecting microscope the carotid bifurcation was identified. From a 
medial perspective the carotid body was visualised and ablated using fine watchmakers 
forceps. Effective carotid body ablation was confirmed by an absence of a cardiovascular 
and respiratory response to NaCN (i.v.). Animals were allowed six days for recovery. Once 
confirmation of selective carotid body ablation rats were infused with vehicle, AF-219 (8 
mg/kg/h i.v.) and dopamine hydrochloride (10 μg/kg/min i.v.) on separate days.
Western blotting and immunocytochemical studies—Rat left and right carotid 
bifurcations were surgically removed from deeply anaesthetised rats and immediately 
transferred into ice cold saline. Carotid bodies were dissected under a Motic K Series Stereo 
Microscope (Ted Pella, Inc.). Five SH and four Wistar rats were used for western blotting 
and six SH and six Wistar rats were used for immunohistochemistry. Specificity of the P2X3 
receptor antibody was validated (Supplementary Fig. 10). Carotid artery bifurcations were 
removed and carotid bodies dissected from these and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (left and 
right together) for western blotting or they were fixed in ice cold methanol/DMSO (4:1) for 
immunohistochemistry. The relative expression of protein corresponds to one pair of carotid 
bodies (left and right). Immunohistochemistry was carried out on the whole mount rat 
carotid body and anti-P2X3 receptor antibody (APR026AN0202, Alomone, Israel). 
Incubation with anti-P2X3 and TH antibody was carried out in 2% goat serum over night at 
4°C, gently mixed. All other details are given below (Human Studies) and similar to those 
used in the human studies.
Statistical analysis—Digitally transmitted arterial pressure and renal SNA signals were 
collected continuously during the drug or vehicle infusion period. Arterial pressure was 
measured during resting conditions. The renal SNA signal was amplified, filtered (50-5000 
Hz), full-wave rectified and integrated using a low pass filter with a 20 ms time constant. 
Arterial pressure and renal SNA were sampled at 1k Hz using a 1401 acquisition system and 
purpose-written scripts in Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Designs, Cambridge, 
UK). From the arterial pressure we derived pulse pressure, heart rate and respiratory 
frequency. Power spectral analysis was performed on heart rate using Spike 2 software (CED 
instruments, Cambridge, UK). The inter-burst interval in renal SNA was taken as the 
baseline noise level, and removed from the signal. The renal SNA signal was then scaled, 
with the 30 minutes immediately prior to infusion taken as the 100% normalised level. We 
report the change in renal SNA with AF-219 relative to vehicle. The mean differences 
between baseline and treatment were analysed by the GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad 
Software, Inc., USA). We analysed the spontaneous cardiac and renal sympathetic baroreflex 
gain (sBRG). The sBRG for the arterial pressure–renal SNA relationship was calculated for

 10 minutes immediately before, and the final 10 minutes of the 60 minute infusion period of 
AF-219 or vehicle. Diastolic pressure was smoothed over 5 beats, and positive or negative 
pressure ramps of at least 5 consecutive beats were automatically identified using Spike2 
scripts (CED instruments, Cambridge, UK). All ramps where both heart rate and renal SNA 
opposed the change in the corresponding DBP ramp were included for analysis. As 
described earlier, renal SNA was normalised with the baseline (pre-infusion) level set at 
100%. A paired student t-test was used to compare the renal SNA sBRG between vehicle 
and AF-219 infusions.
The type of statistical test performed is indicated in the figure legends. Data were normally 
distributed and variance was comparable between groups statistically compared. Unless 
stated in the figure legends, data were expressed as mean ± SEM are presented and data 
were assumed significant when P < 0.05.
Drugs: Two highly potent and selective non-competitive P2X3 (homotrimeric) and P2X3/
P2X2 (heterotrimeric) receptor antagonists were used in these studies: AF-353 and AF-219. 
Although the antagonists we used have higher affinity for P2X3 homotrimeric 
receptors28,40,44 they cannot fully establish the relative contribution of homotrimeric P2X3 
versus heterotrimeric P2X2/3 receptors. AF-353 was used in all in situ studies and was only 
available to us when these were performed; this drug does cross the blood brain barrier. The 
in vivo experiments used AF-219 as this is known not to cross the blood brain barrier. The 
chemical formula for AF-219 is: (amino-(4-isopropyl-2-methoxyphenyl)sulfone)-5-yl-(2,4-
diaminopyrimidine-5yl)ether. The structure of AF-219 is contained in a published patent 
(see: http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?
PageNum=0&docid=20150057299&IDKey=DA73323D44 81&). Doses used were based on 
IC50 data63,64. For recombinant P2X3 homotrimers the IC50 for AF-35364 and AF-219 was 
~8 nM and ∼30 nM, respectively. A higher IC50 was found for P2X2/3 heterotrimeric 
receptors – for example 100 to 250 nM for AF-219. Note that no inhibitory effect on any 
non-P2X3 subunit containing receptors was noted63,64.
B. Human studies
All participants gave informed consent to participate in the studies, which were approved by 
the Central Bristol Research Ethics Committee (REC numbers: 14/SW/0054 and 12/SW/
0277).
Carotid body tone in hypertensive humans—Small increases in circulating 
dopamine can decrease peripheral chemoreceptor afferent input into the brainstem65. Thus, 
low dose intravenous dopamine infusion (2 μg/kg/min) was used to test for any tonicity from 
the carotid bodies. Six hypertensive humans (age 48.8±3 yr; BMI 28.6±4, three female) with 
an office blood pressure of >140/90 mmHg (ambulatory blood pressure: >139/91 mmHg) 
and on a mean of 2.83 anti-hypertensive medicines were selected. Participants were given an 
intravenous infusion of dextrose (5%) for 5 minutes via peripheral venous access while 
breathing room air as a vehicle control. After the vehicle infusion, the line was purged and 
the intravenous infusion of dopamine (infusion concentration: 100 μg/ml of dopamine in 5% 
dextrose) was started for 5 minutes while breathing room air. Equivalent volumes of

 dextrose and dopamine were administered. Participants were blinded to the order of the 
infusions. This was following by a recovery period of 5 minutes while breathing room air 
allowing time for the dopamine to be metabolised. Respiratory volumes were measured via a 
respiratory flow-head connected to the expiratory port of a non966 rebreathing valve 
attached to a face mask. Data were acquired using PowerLab and LabChart 7 software (AD 
Instruments) and analysed to calculate respiratory rate, tidal volume and minute ventilation 
using Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design) and MATLAB (MathWorks). The data was 
analysed by GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA).
Western blotting and immunocytochemical studies—Human left and right carotid 
bodies were obtained from twelve cadavers. Briefly, carotid bifurcations were cut out, placed 
into cold x1 PBS and both carotid bodies were dissected and processed. The left carotid 
body was directly snap frozen and used for western blotting and right carotid body was 
immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and used for immunohistochemistry.
Western blotting: The left human carotid body was crushed in liquid nitrogen with a mortar 
and pestle. Samples were subsequently homogenised with RIPA Lysis Buffer (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Inc). Homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C and the 
pellet was discarded. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Lowry 
method using the DC-protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd). Samples were mixed 
with loading dye (NuPage, LDS Sample Buffer 4x, Life Technologies) and 20 μg of protein 
was used for protein electrophoresis on 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel, 
Life Technologies). The Amersham ECL Plex Western blotting system using a low-
fluorescent PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and Alexa Fluor 488 
secondary antibody (Life Technologies, UK) were used. This system enables detection and 
quantification with a broad dynamic range and high linearity. After protein transfer, the 
membrane was blocked for 1h at room temperature with 2% Advance blocking agent (GE 
Healthcare). Membranes were incubated with Anti-P2X3 (APR026AN0202; 1:200 dilution) 
over night at 4°C. The membranes were subsequently washed with 1xPBS/0.1%Tween three 
times for 10 minutes at room temperature. Incubation with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 
488 was carried out in the dark at room temperature. Before imaging, the membrane was 
thoroughly washed. Signal was detected by scanning the membrane on a fluorescent laser 
scanner, Typhoon (GE Healt hcare). Protein expressions were quantified using ImageQuant 
software (GE Healthcare). The specificity of anti-P2X3 antibody was confirmed by 
membrane incubation with blocking peptide (APR026AG0140, Alomone; Supplementary 
Fig. 10).
Immunofluoresce: Human right carotid bodies were cut 20 μM thick on a cryostat. Carotid 
body slices were incubated with 10% goat serum/0.1% Saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) for 1h 
at room temperature and gently agitated overnight. Primary antibody incubation with anti-
P2X3 receptor (APR026AN0202, Alomone, Israel; 1:25 dilution) and anti-tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH, F-11, sc-25269, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc; dilution 1:25) was carried 
out using manufacturers recommendations in 2% goat serum over night at 4°C, overnight. 
Samples were then washed in 1 × PBS four times for 10 minutes at room temperature and 
the secondary antibody was applied for 1 hour at room temperature. Anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor

 488 was use to visualise the P2X3 receptor and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 was used to 
visualise tyrosine hydroxylase. Secondary antibody incubation was followed by washing as 
described above and the samples were mounted on slides using mounting medium 
(Vectashield, H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Inc). Carotid bodies were examined under a 
Leica SP8 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope attached to a Leica DM I6000 inverted 
epifluorescence microscope and imaging was performed using ‘hybrid’ GaAsP detectors for 
greater sensitivity. Images were processed in Adobe Illustrator CS3.

strains. (b), responses of neurones in (a) following P2X3 receptor blockade with AF-353 (20 
μM, 20 nl), which was delivered focally into the carotid body by picoinjection. Effects in SH 
rats were reversed upon washout. Grouped mean data summarising rat strain related 
differences and responses in membrane potential (c; see also Supplementary Fig. 1a,b) and 
chemoreflex evoked firing responses (d) before and after P2X3 receptor antagonism. Data in 
(c) are mean ± s.d. and those in (d) are mean ± s.e.m. One-way ANOVA Bonferroni post-test 
(n = 12 SH, n = 10 Wistar rats). The difference in expression of P2x3 and P2x2 receptor 
mRNA from petrosal chemoreceptive neurones (identified using sodium cyanide, NaCN, 
22.5 μg, i.a.) during whole cell patch (e) was revealed using single cell PCR ((f); n = 5 or 6).

 Figure 5. 
The anti-hypertensive action of P2X3 receptor antagonism is associated with a reduction in 
sympathetic activity in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats in situ and in vivo. A 
comparison of the effect of a P2X3 receptor antagonist (AF-353; 20 μM, 15 nl) applied 
locally to both carotid bodies on the ongoing thoracic chain sympathetic activity (arrow, raw: 
tSN; integrated: ∫tSN) and the sympathetic nerve reflex response (arrow head) to peripheral 
chemoreceptor stimulation (evoked by NaCN, 22.5 μg i.a.) in 12 Wistar (a) and 12 SH rats 
(b). The effect of P2X3 receptor antagonism within both carotid bodies on the basal (c), 
inspiratory- (d) and expiratory (e) modulated tSN for both rat strains is shown (n = 12 each). 
Inspiratory and expiratory modulation of tSN was determined using averaged triggering 
from the phrenic nerve (PN). One-way ANOVA Bonferroni post-test; data are mean ± s.e.m. 
from in situ rat preparations (n = 12 each strain). (f), renal sympathetic nerve activity (RNA) 
recorded from conscious radio697 telemetered in vivo SH rats (n = 5) during infusions of 
AF-219 (8 mg/kg/h i.v.). Note the similar time course of the response in RNA to the fall in 
systolic blood pressure depicted in Fig. 4(a). A representative example of the peripheral 
chemoreflex evoked sympathoexcitatory response (NaCN 22.5 μg i.a.) in a conscious radio-
telemetered SH rat before and after AF-219 (g) with mean data shown in (h), which includes 
drug washout data. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA, with Holm-Sidek post-hoc 
comparison. n = 5, * P < 0.05, *** P < 0.001.
