ore rapid treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients 
with intravenous alteplase is associated with improved 
outcomes.1,2 Because of the importance of earlier treatment 
with intravenous alteplase, the highest recognition in the 
American Heart Association/American Stroke Association’s 
Target: Stroke initiative is currently awarded to primary stroke 
centers (PSC) who achieve a door-to-needle (DTN) time for 
alteplase administration within 60 minutes in ≥75% of patients 
with acute ischemic stroke and within 45 minutes in ≥50% 
of these patients.3 Several approaches to reducing DTN times 
for alteplase administration have been studied, including in-
hospital system-level bundles, such as the Helsinki model4,5 
and use of centralized decision making via remote digital-net-
work neurological specialty consultation (telestroke care).6–12

Background and Purpose—Faster treatment with intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke is associated with better 
outcomes. Starting in 2015, Kaiser Permanente Northern California redesigned its acute stroke workflow across all 21 
Kaiser Permanente Northern California stroke centers to (1) follow a single standardized version of a modified Helsinki 
model and (2) have all emergency stroke cases managed by a dedicated telestroke neurologist. We examined the effect of 
Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Stroke EXpediting the PRrocess of Evaluating and Stopping Stroke program on 
door-to-needle (DTN) time, alteplase use, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates.
Methods—The program was introduced in a staggered fashion from September 2015 to January 2016. We compared DTN 
times for a seasonally adjusted 9-month period at each center before implementation to the corresponding 9-month 
calendar period from the start of implementation. The primary outcome was the DTN time for alteplase administration. 
Secondary outcomes included rate of alteplase administrations per month, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 
disposition at time of discharge.
Results—This study included 310 patients treated with alteplase in the pre–EXpediting the PRrocess of Evaluating and 
Stopping Stroke period and 557 patients treated with alteplase in the EXpediting the PRrocess of Evaluating and Stopping 
Stroke period. After implementation, alteplase administrations increased to 62/mo from 34/mo at baseline (P<0.001). 
Median DTN time decreased to 34 minutes after implementation from 53.5 minutes prior (P<0.001), and DTN time 
of <60 minutes was achieved in 87.1% versus 61.0% (P<0.001) of patients. DTN times <30 minutes were much more 
common in the Stroke EXpediting the PRrocess of Evaluating and Stopping Stroke period (40.8% versus 4.2% before 
implementation). There was no significant difference in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates in the 2 periods (3.8% 
versus 2.2% before implementation; P=0.29).
Conclusions—Introduction of a standardized modified Helsinki protocol across 21 hospitals using telestroke management 
was associated with increased alteplase administrations, significantly shorter DTN times, and no increase in adverse 
outcomes.

 134  Stroke  January 2018
Although the Helsinki model has been found to significantly 
reduce DTN times,4,5 it remains unclear whether telestroke ini-
tiatives can have an additional impact on treatment times.10,11,13
The Helsinki stroke thrombolysis model includes 12 mea-
sures designed to streamline the process of alteplase adminis-
tration in ischemic stroke, including hospital prenotification 
by emergency services, direct transfer of patients for com-
puted tomography (CT) immediately after rapid neurological 
evaluation in the emergency department (ED), premixing of 
alteplase, rapid interpretation of CT results, and administra-
tion of alteplase in the CT suite.4,5 The model has been shown 
to improve DTN time for alteplase in single-center studies,4,5 
but an implementation of these model components has not 
yet been reported for a large-scale system of care. Telestroke 
interventions allow centralization of expertise to a small num-
ber of stroke-trained neurologists by connecting the patient 
and stroke expert virtually using a secure video link and 
remote evaluation of medical imaging.11,12,14–17 The Helsinki 
model and telestroke have conceptually independent advan-
tages, but, to date, the results of combining these 2 methods in 
a large number of hospitals have not been reported.
Here, we present the results of the Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California (KPNC) Stroke EXpediting the PRocess of 
Evaluating and Stopping Stroke (EXPRESS) program. Stroke 
EXPRESS combines a modified Helsinki protocol with a cen-
tralized telestroke service across 21 community hospitals in an 
integrated care delivery system that serves >4 million members.
Methods
Study Setting
KPNC provides care in 21 hospitals and 60 clinics, with ≈17 million 
outpatient and ED visits and 250 000 hospitalizations each year (includ-
ing ≈3500 new stroke discharges per year). Patients who are demo-
graphically similar to the overall population of Northern California are 
cared for by a single provider group, The Permanente Medical Group, 
with 8500 physicians (including 112 neurologists). All 21 KPNC hos-
pitals are Joint Commission–certified PSC and 2 are certified compre-
hensive stroke centers providing endovascular stroke treatment.
Intervention
Before Stroke EXPRESS, the process of patient evaluation and 
alteplase decision making occurred in a serial fashion with the initial 
evaluation performed by the ED physician and imaging studies com-
pleted typically before obtaining the local on-call neurologist consul-
tation (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). No telestroke 
was used before the Stroke EXPRESS.
The standardized protocol used in Stroke EXPRESS included 
ambulance prenotification, regional electronic medical record medical 
history review, rapid neurological evaluation, prenotification of ambu-
lance transport for possible transfer for endovascular stroke treatment, 
rapid transport to the CT suite, and administration of alteplase in the 
CT suite (Table 1). The telestroke system connects all 21 hospitals to 
a single teleneurologist from the Stroke EXPRESS team who takes 
dedicated acute stroke call for all hospitals. For patient arrivals via 
ambulance, an ED staff contacts the on-call teleneurologist by calling 
a centralized number after being notified by prehospital providers of 
possible incoming acute stroke. For patient arrivals via walk-in, the 
triage nurse would activate the stroke alert and call teleneurology. The 
teleneurologist then performs remote video neurological examination 
together with the on-site ED physician and supervises all aspects of 
acute stroke care using a single standardized protocol for all hospitals. 
The teleneurologist would order alteplase to be mixed and hold if the 
patient meets all criteria except for completion of the noncontrast head 
CT scan. The telemedicine platform for all of the EDs is mobile and 
allows the stroke expert to virtually move with the patient from the ED 
to the CT suite and back. The Stroke EXPRESS program was rolled 
out in a staggered fashion to each of the 21 KPNC medical centers and 
was available during the hours of 7 am to midnight at each center dur-
ing the study period. The program was not operated overnight because 
of a combination of resource considerations and few stroke arrivals 
eligible for intravenous alteplase in the midnight to 7 am time period. 
Between midnight and 7 am, acute stroke evaluations were made by the 
ED physician and the local on-call neurologist in an identical fashion 
to the pre-EXPRESS workflow.
Each stroke center underwent an implementation training day with 
a regional simulation team. Role cards for each member of an acute 
stroke treatment team (including ED physician, teleneurologist, pri-
mary nurse, ED manager, radiology technician, radiologist, etc) were 
developed and used during all training and actual stroke alerts. Each 
teleneurologist underwent the same protocol training and conducted 
observed mock stroke alerts before taking part in the Stroke EXPRESS 
program. Monitoring of the program during the study period was per-
formed at weekly telestroke meetings and monthly local stroke com-
mittee meetings, as well as at the regional healthcare system level.
It should be noted that our telemedicine model differs from the 
traditional hub-and-spoke model. In Stroke EXPRESS, there is no 
single hospital serving as the hub. The program is based on the cen-
tralization of expertise of stroke neurologists recruited from across 
the network serving as a virtual hub, not a physical hub. The number 
of teleneurologists ranged from 9 to 12 during the study period. In 
addition, the teleneurologists use a single standardized protocol to 
handle all stroke alerts from all centers.
Data Source and Subjects
The data that support the findings of this study are available from 
the corresponding author on reasonable request. Data for the present 
study were extracted from the electronic medical record and asso-
ciated relational databases as part of a quality initiative to evaluate 
Stroke EXPRESS. Nine months of EXPRESS data were extracted 
from the electronic medical record, starting with the staggered go-live 
date for each center, and were compared with data extracted for the 
9-month period before implementation, matched for calendar dates 
to account for any potential seasonal variations. Cases were included 
for analysis only if the ED triage time was between 7 am and mid-
night for both periods because this was the availability time for Stroke 
EXPRESS for the study period.
To ensure accurate data on medical history, comorbidities, and out-
comes, only enrolled KPNC members were included in the present 
analysis.
Permission to publish fully anonymized, aggregate data from this 
quality initiative, with waiver of the need for institution review board 
evaluation and waiver of individual patient consent, was granted by 
the KPNC Research Determination officer. This research was con-
ducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Measurements
For each patient, we collected basic demographic information (age, 
sex, self-reported race/ethnicity), last known well time (in the post-
EXPRESS cohort), telestroke activation time, ED arrival time, 
alteplase bolus time, medical comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, congestive heart 
failure), Charlson comorbidity index,18 modified National Institutes 
of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) score on arrival and mNIHSS 
score19 recorded during hospitalization, mode of ED arrival, history 
prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, length of inpatient stay, 
and hospital discharge status. Symptomatic intracerebral hemor-
rhage was determined based on European Cooperative Acute Stroke 
Study criteria: any hemorrhage on repeat CT scan performed up to 
48 hours from presentation associated with at least a 4-point increase 
in the mNIHSS.20 The mNIHSS differs in only minor ways from the 
original scale and has been extensively validated against the parent 
scale21; we have previously reported its use in the context of our 
KPNC data source.22

Statistical Analysis
Univariable analyses comparing subjects in the pre-EXPRESS and 
EXPRESS periods were performed with the Fisher exact test for cat-
egorical variables and the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis equality-of-
populations rank test for continuous data. The numbers of alteplase 
administrations in the 2 study periods were compared with simple 
Poisson regression.
Multivariable analyses were conducted with mixed-effects linear 
and logistic models, allowing random intercepts for medical center. 
Models included adjustment for age, sex, race, baseline NIHSS score, 
Charlson comorbidity index, mode of ED arrival (ambulance/other), 
history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, dia-
betes mellitus, heart failure, and prior stroke. 
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.3 (SAS, 
Cary, NC) and Stata, version 14.1 (Stata, College Station, TX).
Results
There were 310 patients who received alteplase during the 
pre-EXPRESS period and 557 patients who received alteplase 
during the corresponding EXPRESS period (difference in 
alteplase administrations per month, P<0.001; Table 2; Figure 
I in the online-only Data Supplement). On average, there were 
8.8 stroke alerts daily in the pre-EXPRESS period compared 
with 11.7 stroke alerts daily in the EXPRESS period across 
21 centers. The rates of alteplase administration were 13.1% 
(310 cases/2375 stroke alerts) and 17.6% (557 cases/3168 
stroke alerts; P<0.001), respectively. There were no significant 
differences in patient characteristics between these 2 alteplase 
cohorts for demographics, mode of ED arrival, baseline mNI-
HSS, and comorbidities (Table 2). Among those who received 
alteplase, there were 12 (3.87%) in the pre-EXPRESS period 
who did not have a discharge diagnosis of stroke (ie, stroke 
mimics) compared with 38 (6.82%) in the EXPRESS period 
(P=0.04).
Both continuous and categorical DTN times decreased 
significantly in the Stroke EXPRESS period (Tables 3 and 
4; Figure). Mean DTN time decreased to 41.8 minutes from 
63.2 minutes, and median DTN time decreased to 34.0 min-
utes from 53.5 minutes (P<0.001; Table 3). The percentage of 
cases treated within 30 minutes increased to 40.8% from 4.2% 
(P<0.001; Table 4). In addition, median DTN times decreased 
consistently across nearly all medical centers regardless of 
volumes of alteplase cases (Figure II in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage during the 
2 study periods were not significantly different (3.8% versus 
2.2% before implementation; P=0.29; Table 5). We performed 
a sensitivity analysis on DTN times for more appropriately 
treated patients by removing the stroke mimics and found 
the median DTN times similar to those seen with the primary 
analysis, decreased from 53 to 34 minutes (P<0.001).
Although we required Kaiser Permanente membership 
for the primary analyses reported here (to ensure complete 
capture of comorbidities and other information), secondary 
analysis comparing Kaiser Permanente members and non-
members treated in the same Stroke EXPRESS period at each 
hospital showed similar mean DTN times (41.8±30.6 minutes 
for Kaiser Permanente members [n=557] versus 40.0±33.1 
minutes for nonmembers [n=141]; P=0.54). In addition, we 
also observed a significant decrease in the mean DTN time 
for nonmembers in the EXPRESS period compared with 
pre-EXPRESS period (40±33.1 versus 61.2±36 minutes; 
P<0.001).
During the study period, teleneurology was only available 
from 7 am to midnight. Sensitivity analysis for the hours from 
midnight to 7 am showed 20 treated cases in the pre-EXPRESS 
period and 43 cases in the post-EXPRESS period and a 
smaller and nonsignificant difference in mean DTN times in 
pre-EXPRESS compared with EXPRESS period (69.2±34.7 
versus 56±35.7 minutes; P=0.09).
There was no significant difference in the median length 
of hospital stay (3.1 versus 3.5 days before implementa-
tion; P=0.14) or discharge disposition to home (54.8% 
versus 55.4% before implementation; P=0.83) between the 
periods.
Discussion
We found that a standardized system combining a modified 
Helsinki model with a multicenter telestroke program led 
to increased alteplase use and substantially shorter DTN

times among patients with acute ischemic stroke. This suc-
cess was observed across nearly all medical centers regard-
less of volumes of treated stroke. Despite a 72% relative 
increase in the symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rate, 
this was not a statistically significant increase in the setting 
of 967 total patients treated. There was a small increase 
in the number of possible stroke mimics, which may have 
resulted from the increased speed of the new workflow, but 
this would not be sufficient to explain the larger increase in 
alteplase usage.
Overall rates of alteplase administration for ischemic stroke 
are increasing in the United States,23,24 but remain low, from 
4% to 6% as of 2010.24 Even among patients presenting to 
the ED within 2 hours of ischemic stroke onset, ≈25% are 
not treated with alteplase.25 The main reason reported for non-
treatment is mild or rapidly improving stroke.25
Earlier treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients with 
intravenous thrombolysis leads to improved outcomes,1,2 
particularly when alteplase is administered in the first hour 
after stroke onset.26 Despite these goals, rapid treatment with 
alteplase shortly after hospital arrival remains elusive in many 
academic and community settings, with a large number of 
parallel factors influencing DTN, including presence or lack 
or ambulance prenotification systems,27 time to imaging per-
formance,28 laboratory protocols, and presence or absence of 
alteplase premixing for high-probability alteplase candidates. 
Paradoxically, patients presenting earlier after stroke onset 
have been reported to have longer DTN times.29
Several system-level interventions have been explored in 
attempts to reduce time delays in thrombolytic administra-
tion.4,5,30–32 The Helsinki model has been the most successful 
of these interventions.4,5 The initial experience in a Helsinki

hospital reduced DTN times significantly,4 and external rep-
lication in a Melbourne hospital achieved similar results.5 To 
date, the experience with the Helsinki model has been limited 
to single-center efforts.
The Target: Stroke initiative by the American Heart 
Association/American Stroke Association has been intro-
duced in many certified PSC in the United States This was a 
national quality improvement initiative focused on reducing 
DTN times for eligible patients being treated with intravenous 
alteplase. Despite involving only broad guidance and recom-
mendations across >1000 centers, and an award recognition 
program, Target: Stroke has also been found to reduce DTN 
times.30 Participating Target: Stroke hospitals reduced aver-
age DTN time from 74 to 59 minutes and increased alteplase 
administrations within 60 minutes from 29.6% to 53.3%.30
Telestroke care has also been used successfully for manage-
ment of acute stroke treatment in a variety of settings, with a 
focus on bringing stroke expertise to more remote or under-
served areas.6,7,11 A horizontal networking approach of a hubless 
system of stroke specialists across multiple hospitals has been 
previously reported from the British National Health Service.33 
Overall, telemedicine may be associated with improved alteplase 
use, but it remains unclear whether telemedicine can also sub-
stantially reduce DTN times.10,11,13 In 1 randomized trial of tele-
medicine consultation versus telephone consultation, there was 
no difference in alteplase use despite a higher percentage of cor-
rect treatment decisions made in the telemedicine group.13
The Stroke EXPRESS program reported here takes a modi-
fied Helsinki protocol for acute stroke workflows and scales 
it to 21 hospitals in an integrated care delivery system by 
using telestroke to provide standardized, efficient care across 
the network. Because the whole program was rolled out as a 
bundle of multiple interventions, we could not identify one or 
more specific elements as being responsible for the dramatic 
improvement in DTN time and increased alteplase usage. 
However, the biggest changes made in this program on acute 
stroke alert management included a reduction in the time 
between ED arrival and stroke neurologist’s involvement in 
the case and reduction in ED arrival to order to mix alteplase. 
In the pre-EXPRESS period, a stroke alert activation and a 
call to the neurologist were not made until after the ED physi-
cian had evaluated the potential stroke patient. The new pro-
tocol called for immediate activation of stroke alert and call to 
telestroke for all potential acute stroke cases. Furthermore, no 
alteplase mix and hold was ever ordered before the comple-
tion of a head CT scan with the old protocol because such 
mechanism was not available pre-EXPRESS. Having access 
to early electronic medical record review in KPNC members 
was an added benefit, but this was not a required part of reduc-
ing DTN time as shown by the similar DTN time results for 
non-KPNC members. The successful rollout of this program 
demonstrates that telemedicine may have roles beyond the 
traditional hub-and-spoke model: we find that a large group 
of hospitals in an integrated system can collectively create a

stroke telemedicine network that is virtually, but not physi-
cally, centralized.
Our study has limitations. This is a retrospective analysis 
of data collected prospectively from a multicenter quality 
initiative, and randomization did not occur at the patient, 
physician, or hospital level. The results can only be gener-
alizable to acute stroke care provided during the hours of 
7 am to midnight because telestroke was not available from 
midnight to 7 am during the study period. However, there was 
a trend for decreased DTN time overnight post-EXPRESS 
suggesting a possible influence of the new workflow even in 
the absence of teleneurologist. This was a before-and-after 
single-cohort study and therefore subject to confounding 
by secular trends (although the sharp change in alteplase 
DTN times associated temporally with the staggered rollout 
should serve to minimize the impact of such confounding). 
Because this is a before-and-after study, it did not include 
an additional long-term follow-up phase to assess for sus-
tainability although the overall trend in administration 
times seems to be stable. Although the KPNC population 
is generally representative of the population of Northern 
California,34 KPNC members by definition have medical 
insurance, and thus more indigent populations are under-
represented. However, with the new telestroke program, 
similar mean DTN times were achieved for members and 
nonmembers. As noted, all 21 centers were certified as 
PSC or comprehensive stroke centers before the interven-
tion. Therefore, it remains unclear whether this intervention 
could be translated to non-PSC.
In summary, implementation of a modified Helsinki model 
with multicenter telestroke management across 21 hospital 
centers was associated with an increase in alteplase adminis-
tration rates and significantly shorter DTN times with a symp-
tomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rate that was not statistically 
different from the rate in preimplementation. Future studies 
are needed to better evaluate the long-term sustainability of 
the intervention and its effect on clinical outcomes, including 
mortality and long-term disability.
