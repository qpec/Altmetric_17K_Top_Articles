Abstract
Background
Individuals with criminal histories have high rates of opioid dependence and mortality.
Excess mortality is largely attributable to overdose deaths. Methadone maintenance treat-
ment (MMT) is one of the best evidence-based opioid substitution treatments (OSTs), but
there is uncertainty about whether methadone treatment reduces the risk of mortality
among convicted offenders over extended follow-up periods. The objective of this study was
to investigate the association between adherence to MMT and overdose fatality as well as
other causes of mortality.
Methods and findings
We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving linked population-level administrative
data among individuals in British Columbia (BC), Canada with a history of conviction and
who filled a methadone prescription between January 1, 1998 and March 31, 2015. Partici-
pants were followed from the date of first-dispensed methadone prescription until censoring
(date of death or March 31, 2015). Methadone was divided into medicated (methadone was
dispensed) and nonmedicated (methadone was not dispensed) periods and analysed as a
time-varying exposure. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using multivari-
able Cox regression to examine mortality during the study period. All-cause and cause-spe-
cific mortality rates were compared during medicated and nonmedicated methadone
periods. Participants (n = 14,530) had a mean age of 34.5 years, were 71.4% male, and had
a median follow-up of 6.9 years. A total of 1,275 participants died during the observation
period. The overall all-cause mortality rate was 11.2 per 1,000 person-years (PYs). Partici-
pants were significantly less likely to die from both nonexternal (adjusted HR [AHR] 0.27
[95% CI 0.23–0.33]) and external (AHR 0.41 [95% CI 0.33–0.51]) causes during medicated
periods, independent of sociodemographic, criminological, and health-related factors.
Death due to infectious diseases was 5 times lower (AHR 0.20 [95% CI 0.13–0.30]), and
accidental poisoning (overdose) deaths were nearly 3 times lower (AHR 0.39 [95% CI 0.30–

of results. The use of a Canadian offender population may limit generalizability of results.
Furthermore, our observation period represents community-based methadone prescribing
and may omit prescriptions administered during hospital separations. Therefore, the magni-
tude of the protective effects of methadone from nonexternal causes of death should be
interpreted with caution.
Conclusions
Adherence to methadone was associated with significantly lower rates of death in a popula-
tion-level cohort of Canadian convicted offenders. Achieving higher rates of adherence may
reduce overdose deaths and other causes of mortality among offenders and similarly mar-
ginalized populations. Our findings warrant examination in other study centres in response
to the crisis of opiate-involved deaths.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Individuals with criminal histories experience high rates of opioid dependence and pre-
mature mortality.
• Deaths caused by opioids are rising acutely and offenders are at risk.
• Adherence to opioid substitution treatments (OSTs), such as methadone, has been
shown to reduce the risk of death during custody and immediately following release.
• Little is known about the long-term association between methadone adherence and
mortality.
What did researchers do and find?
• This study integrated population-level data including prescriptions, convictions, and
deaths in British Columbia (BC), Canada spanning 1998–2015.
• We examined the risk of all-cause and cause-specific death among 14,530 people with
criminal convictions who had been prescribed methadone.
• Overall and cause-specific mortality rates were compared between periods when metha-
done was and was not dispensed.
• Periods when methadone was dispensed were associated with lower risk of mortality,
including overdose fatalities, after controlling for covariates.

Introduction
Overdoses and deaths caused by opioids have been declared a public health emergency in
North America. The rising prevalence of opioid dependence [1], alongside the emergence of
fentanyl in the illicit drug market [2], is contributing to premature mortality and sparking an
urgent need to mobilize public health and public safety resources. Many of North America’s
leading health organisations (American Medical Association, Health Canada, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention) have set priorities in response to the escalating public health
crisis [3]. Interventions emphasize prevention, education, and comprehensive care, including
access to substitution treatment where indicated [4]. Particular attention has been directed
toward high-risk populations, including offenders. Accidental poisoning is the most common
cause of mortality among opioid-dependent individuals [5,6], with opioids present in the vast
majority of drug-related deaths among ex-prisoners [7]. Several mortality-related risk factors
are overrepresented among offenders (e.g., repeated incarceration, low socioeconomic status,
and homelessness) [8,9], compounding the hazards associated with substance misuse. The
prevalence of opioid dependence [10] and risk of death from illicit drugs [11,12], such as her-
oin, is higher among offenders and is acutely elevated in the weeks following prison release
[13,14]. Despite evidence that prevention and treatment options (e.g., methadone) may reduce
the risk of death among opioid-dependent individuals [15,16], there remain significant barri-
ers [17,18] and underutilisation [19] of substitution treatment options for offenders. Factors
such as stigma, insufficient pharmacotherapy knowledge, concerns related to medication
diversion, and poor links between corrections and community-based care providers can
restrict access to methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and continuity of care for offend-
ers with opioid dependence [20,21] whether they are sentenced to custody or community set-
tings, as well as following the completion of sentencing.
MMT remains one of the best researched and most widely used opioid substitution treat-
ments (OSTs) [22,23]. MMT engagement is associated with reduced illicit opioid use [24],
infectious disease transmission [25], and recidivism [26,27]. While the benefits of MMT adher-
ence are well established for a number of health and justice outcomes, including reduced
health care costs [28], the role of MMT adherence in mortality among offenders is less clear. A
number of observational studies in Europe and Australia have indicated that adherence to
methadone reduces the risk of death during treatment compared with periods of nontreatment
[29–33] in general opiate-dependent populations. In these studies, treatment effects of metha-
done are strongest for drug-related deaths [31] and among subpopulations of MMT users with
infectious diseases (e.g., by potentiating adherence to antiretroviral treatments [ARTs]) [34].
However, these studies are not specific to offenders (in or out of custody) and are drawn from
relatively small samples sizes [30,31,35], with maximum follow-up periods of 4 to 7 years
[29,33,36]. Among studies that do focus on MMT among offenders, most concentrate on mor-
tality in the initial postrelease period [16,37] or during custody [38,39]. However, in many
jurisdictions, including British Columbia (BC), the majority of convictions result in sentences
served exclusively in the community (versus prison) and are of relatively short duration. Little

 is known about the long-term course and impact of MMT among people who have served sen-
tences at some point in their lives, although available evidence confirms that MMT adherence
fluctuates over time [40]. Despite clinical and empirical support from observational research
supporting a broad range of protective effects, independent systematic reviews evaluating the
association between methadone treatment and mortality have concluded that the available evi-
dence is “weak” [41] and “suggestive” [24]. Moreover, the very limited body of experimental
evidence is equivocal. Mattick and colleagues [22] reported positive but nonsignificant associa-
tions between mortality and methadone compared with nontreatment. In contrast, a recent
meta-analysis [32] reported greater reductions in mortality with methadone compared with
buprenorphine.
Careful examination of MMT and mortality among offenders is particularly valuable due to
elevated risks in this population (e.g., injection drug use, HIV) [42], periods of potential inter-
ruptions in treatment (e.g., incarceration) [43], barriers to treatment [44], and high likelihood
of relapse [45]. In this study, we investigated the association between methadone and mortality
in the population of convicted offenders in BC, Canada over a 17-year observation period. We
describe the distribution of nonexternal and external causes of morbidity and mortality and
address 2 main questions related to MMT: is the risk of all-cause mortality lower during peri-
ods of dispensed methadone compared with nondispensed periods? Is the risk of overdose
mortality lower during periods of dispensed methadone?
Methods
Study design and population
Data were obtained by linking population-level administrative records in BC, Canada under
the Inter-Ministry Research Initiative (IMRI). The study cohort consisted of all individuals
with provincial justice contacts (n = 250,884) in BC. Individuals with a history of conviction
and who filled a methadone prescription between January 1, 1998 and March 31, 2015 were
eligible for inclusion. Citizens of BC are legally required to register with the province’s publicly
funded health system and are assigned a unique ID. This ID is used to link information from
different program areas. We used several comprehensive data sets: the Ministry of Health’s
PharmaNet, Vital Statistics, and Billing databases; and the Ministry of Justice’s registry of con-
victions. The IMRI serves as a resource for the development of policies and services that span
health, justice, and social welfare sectors. Details of the IMRI that are not essential to the cur-
rent study have been described elsewhere [46].
Follow-up extended from the date of first-dispensed methadone prescription until censor-
ing (date of death or March 31, 2015) (Fig 1). Methadone prescription transactions were
collected by the Ministry of Health. Corrections-related incidents and sociodemographic vari-
ables (age, gender, ethnicity, and education) were collected by the Ministry of Justice. Mortal-
ity data were obtained from the BC Vital Statistics Agency. Covariate information concerning
medical and lab service use was extracted from the Provincial Medical Services Plan database,
which details the date, diagnostic code, and cost associated with medical services to citizens in
BC, including while serving sentences under provincial corrections. The study was approved
by the Simon Fraser University Research Ethics Board.
Variables
Data on the main exposure, methadone, were extracted from the PharmaNet database, a prov-
ince-wide network linking all prescriptions issued by BC pharmacies. This register omits
dispensing information during hospitalisation or outside the province of BC. Authorized phy-
sicians who hold an exemption from Health Canada are permitted to prescribe methadone in

 BC [47]. Methadone is dispensed to individuals who meet criteria for opioid dependence as
defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 5th edition and/
or DSM-IV-TR. Patients receiving methadone are required to comply with daily witnessed
ingestion under the supervision of a pharmacist (i.e., attend pharmacy daily to receive dis-
pensed dose of methadone), unless authorized to hold ‘carry’ privileges [47].
Methadone was treated as a time-varying exposure (i.e., medication status was not constant
throughout follow-up), and each participant’s follow-up was divided into medicated (metha-
done was dispensed) and nonmedicated (methadone was not dispensed) periods. Following
the method used in previous research [27], a participant was considered exposed to methadone
based on pharmacy fill transaction dates (see S1 Text). If a participant filled their methadone
prescription consistently (no gap in pharmacy transaction dates) for a period of time, this was
treated as a single interval and considered a medicated period (methadone was dispensed). If a
participant didn’t fill a prescription for a period of time (gap in pharmacy transaction dates),
the interval was considered a nonmedicated period (methadone was not dispensed). Partici-
pants were expected to alternate between medicated and nonmedicated periods (for further
details see S1 Text).
The main outcome was death during follow-up. When a person dies in BC, medical per-
sonnel (physician or nurse practitioner) or a coroner must complete a death certificate, and
the death must be registered with the Vital Statistics Agency. Causes of death were coded
according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Prob-
lems 10th Revision (ICD-10). We extracted details of all-cause mortality and cause-specific
mortality separated by ICD-10 chapter in accordance with the recorded cause of death.
Within the category of nonexternal causes of death (ICD-10 chapter I to XVII), we sepa-
rately examined deaths from infectious disease, and within external causes of death (ICD-10
chapter XX), we examined deaths by accidental poisoning and intentional self-harm (i.e.,
suicide).
Several covariates were included, including age (at time of methadone initiation), gender,
ethnicity, education, initiation of methadone period (years), prior offences (year preceding
methadone initiation), number of offences after methadone initiation (time-varying), number
of custody admissions (available from 2007–2015 and used for subgroup analysis only) after
methadone initiation (time-varying), severe mental illness, prior service use for non–sub-
stance-related mental disorders, prior service use for substance use disorders, and prior service
use for nonpsychiatric medical reasons (see S1 Text for details).
Statistical analyses
We used descriptive statistics (counts and proportions for nominal variables; mean and SD, or
median and interquartile range [IQR], for continuous variables) to characterize the study sam-
ple. We chose time-to-event, or survival, analysis because our outcome of interest was not only
the occurrence of an event (death) but also when the event occurred [48]. Methadone was our
primary covariate and was time-varying during the follow-up period. To address this time-
varying effect, we used the extended Cox model [49]. As an estimate of effect size, we reported
the hazard ratios (HRs) along with 95% CIs.
To control for potential confounding, HRs were estimated using multivariable Cox regres-
sion, with adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, education, methadone initiation period, psy-
chiatric diagnoses, criminal history, and health service use. In the Cox regression, we assessed
the proportional hazards assumption using Kaplan Meier curve as well as the Schoenfeld resid-
uals [50,51]. We found no violation of proportionality for methadone in the Cox models. We
used the robust variance estimator to estimate SEs for the parameters [52,53]. We chose the

 conventional alpha level (p � 0.05) to report significance for the estimated parameters. All
reported p-values were 2-sided.
We used the Cox model for cause-specific deaths and also conducted competing risk regres-
sion analysis [54–56] as a sensitivity analysis. We performed competing risk regression using the
method proposed by Fine and Gray [57]. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted inflat-
ing the definition of last-dispensed methadone prescription from 1 day to 3 and 7 days and
among participants whose cause of death was HIV. A subgroup analysis was conducted among
participants who initiated methadone and had at least one custody admission restricted to the
years 2007 to 2015, when admission and release dates were deemed to be sufficiently reliable.
Individuals with missing demographic information, including ethnicity and education
level, were not excluded from the analysis but were included as separate categories titled
‘unknown’ ethnicity and ‘unknown’ education level. STATA 13.1 was used to conduct all
analyses.
Results
The study cohort included 14,530 convicted offenders (mean [SD] age 34.5 [9.4] years; 71.4%
male) followed from January 1, 1998 to March 31, 2015 for a total of 114,243.7 person-years
(PYs). Table 1 shows baseline sociodemographic and criminological information as well as
diagnostic and medical services details for the eligible sample. For methadone prescriptions,
the median number of medicated and nonmedicated periods in years were 2.0 (IQR 0.5–4.9)
and 3.2 (IQR 0.9–7.1), respectively, representing a total medicated time of 47,681.7 PYs and a
nonmedicated time of 66,562.0 PYs.
During a median follow-up time of 6.9 years (IQR 3.4–12.8), 1,275 participants died (see
Table 2). Median age at death was 45.1 (minimum, maximum: 21.3, 75.2). The overall all-
cause mortality rate was 11.2 per 1,000 PYs, and the rate was higher during nonmedicated
periods (15.0 per 1,000 PYs) compared with medicated periods (5.9 per 1,000 PYs). A total of
504 deaths (39.5%) were attributed to external causes or morbidity and mortality, which were
predominantly accidental poisoning (27.8%) and intentional self-harm (4.2%). Infectious dis-
eases (14.9%) and cancer (11.2%) were other major causes of death classified as nonexternal
causes. Descriptive statistics characterizing events in the time leading up to death (n = 1,275)
are available in supporting information (see S1 Table).
We compared rates of death during dispensed methadone periods and nondispensed peri-
ods. Fig 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for all-cause mortality throughout the follow-up
period. Participants were significantly more likely to die during nonmedicated methadone
periods than during medicated periods (Fig 2).
As shown in Table 3, participants were more likely to die from both nonexternal (adjusted
hazard ratio [AHR] 0.27 [0.23–0.33]) and external (AHR 0.41 [0.33–0.51]) causes during non-
medicated periods. The risk of death due to infectious diseases was 5 times lower (AHR 0.20
[0.13–0.30]) during medicated methadone periods compared with nonmedicated periods.
Similarly, for deaths caused by accidental poisoning and intentional self-harm, the AHRs were
0.39 (0.30–0.50) and 0.36 (0.18–0.70), respectively, representing a roughly 2.75 times lower
risk of death during medicated methadone periods. All other external (AHR 0.54 [0.34–0.85])
and nonexternal (AHR 0.30 [0.25–0.37]) causes of morbidity and mortality were associated
with significantly lower mortality risk during periods when methadone was dispensed. The
effects (AHR) of all other covariates included in the multivariable model are available in Sup-
porting information (S2–S4 Tables).
A competing risk regression demonstrated a similar pattern of results for both nonexternal
(AHR 0.32 [0.27–0.39]) and external causes (AHR 0.46, [0.38–0.57]) of death as well as for

 other types of cause-specific deaths (S5 Table). When restricted to participants who initiated
methadone between 2007 and 2015 (when custody data became available), the rate of custody
admission was 0.3 per PY following methadone initiation. The subgroup analysis (S6 Table)
among participants (n = 2,905) with at least one custody admission (AHR 0.27 [0.15–0.51])
produced findings consistent with our primary results. Similarly, the HIV cause-specific sensi-
tivity analysis (S7 Table) produced comparable methadone treatment effects (AHR 0.19 [0.11–
0.33]). Sensitivity analyses (S8 Table) involving alternate definitions for methadone periods
(from 1 day to 3 and 7 days) confirm the same overall pattern of results for nonexternal (3-day
AHR 0.41 [0.34–0.48]; 7-day AHR 0.52 [0.45–0.52]) and external causes (3-day AHR 0.54
[0.44–0.66); 7-day 0.59 [0.48–0.71]] of death and remain significant although, as expected, the
effect decays when medicated time is inflated to 3 and 7 days.
Discussion
In this longitudinal cohort study, dispensed methadone was associated with significantly lower
risk of both all-cause and cause-specific mortality among patients diagnosed with opioid

 dependence and with prior convictions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate
the association between MMT and mortality in a large sample over an extended period (i.e.,
greater than 10 years) with adjustment for diverse covariates. The majority of our sample did
not commit an offence in the year preceding methadone initiation (62%), and few received
sentences that included time in custody (19%). Therefore, our observation period overwhelm-
ingly corresponds to events occurring in community settings while participants were not
under correctional supervision.
Our study has several implications for the treatment of opioid dependence and prevention
of premature mortality in populations with complex health and social needs including expo-
sure to corrections. The statistically significant relationship between dispensed methadone and
lower risk of all-cause mortality is particularly relevant in the context of North America’s cur-
rent opioid overdose crisis. The World Health Organization has recognised methadone as an
essential medicine for over a decade [58] and recommended access to methadone (or other
agonist treatments) for all opioid-dependent prisoners [59], acknowledging the role of
untreated substance dependence as a contributor to mortality [19,60]. Despite global aware-
ness of the importance of methadone in treating opioid dependence, a number of barriers
limit the optimisation of methadone programs, including high physician patient loads [61],
lack of education and training [20], and stigma [62]. These challenges are often amplified
among criminal justice populations [63] and among individuals residing in remote and rural
areas [64] even when offered through low-barrier services within a universal healthcare system
[65]. In addition, agonist treatment options are not routinely offered alongside psychosocial or
counselling interventions despite recommendations that support their importance in care [66]

 and their relationship to mitigating overdose risk in criminal justice populations [67]. Never-
theless, our results indicate that when methadone is administered, despite current limitations,
it can reduce mortality among marginalized patients with opioid dependence. Previous
research has demonstrated the substantially elevated risk of mortality among offenders during
the period immediately following release from custody [13,68]. Our results expand on this
work to show that mortality risk is elevated among methadone recipients with any exposure to
the corrections system—where the majority are not exposed to custody—and over periods of
time that greatly exceed their time under correctional supervision. Efforts to make methadone

 treatment more accessible, integrated, and comprehensive may yield additional life-saving
benefits.
Consistent with other research [11], overdose deaths accounted for nearly one-third of
mortality in our cohort. In addition to the reduced risk of all-cause mortality, our results dem-
onstrate that adherence to methadone was associated with a lower risk of death from acciden-
tal poisoning compared with nonmedicated periods. Despite evidence that methadone
adherence decreases the risk of fatal overdose [32], poor retention undermines this potential
benefit. Furthermore, the potential elevated risk for overdose associated with treatment adjust-
ments (i.e., induction and cessation) has raised concerns regarding the effectiveness of metha-
done as a harm-reduction measure. However, this concern is weakly supported by evidence
[36] and should not be a deterrent when offering treatment with methadone because fatalities
are more strongly related to other causes [35], including the illicit use of nonprescription
methadone [69]. On average, participants in our cohort spent more time in nonmedicated
periods than medicated periods, signalling an urgent need to substantially improve adherence.
An emerging body of evidence has highlighted the positive impact of MMT for populations
with infectious disease. Patients with HIV/AIDS using methadone are associated with earlier
ART initiation and higher levels of adherence [70,71]. Potential explanations are that MMT
adherence is associated with increased stability and decreased risks (e.g., drug injecting),
enabling increased engagement in HIV treatment. Our results are consistent with the finding
that methadone may potentiate ART adherence in patients with opioid dependence, demon-
strating a 5-fold lower risk of infectious disease mortality compared with nonmedicated meth-
adone periods (in HIV subgroup analyses, this finding remained consistent).
Researchers examining deaths among offenders have focused on the risk immediately fol-
lowing release from custody and have consistently found significant mortality during this criti-
cal period [14]. Although the transition from prison warrants close attention to prevent
mortality, a narrow focus on prison release ‘. . .fails to capture the ongoing elevation of risk
among ex-prisoners, and directs attention away from the ongoing health needs of this chroni-
cally marginalized and unwell group’ [72] (p. 1555). Current harm reduction and addictions
literature advocates for the treatment and management of substance misuse as a chronic dis-
ease [40] rather than an acute episodic illness requiring detoxification [73]. This approach is
supported by observations that a majority of opioid-dependent individuals receiving metha-
done have repeated treatment episodes, with continuous and/or longer treatment duration
typically occurring after several failed attempts [74]. The paucity of literature evaluating mor-
tality risk over extended time periods limits our understanding of risk related to the chronic
and relapsing nature of opioid dependence among individuals with criminal justice involve-
ment. Our research design aimed to address this gap by investigating treatment as it fluctuates
over a relatively long follow-up period.
Our study offers the advantages of a complete population of convicted offenders accessing
methadone, with specific objective measurement of exposure and outcome while controlling
for several key covariates. Our sample included individuals who were exposed to provincial
corrections, typically for short periods of time, serving sentences in noncustodial settings.
Therefore, our observation period overwhelmingly represents community-based methadone
prescribing. Despite its strengths, this study has limitations. The use of a Canadian provincial
offender population may limit the generalizability of results to other settings, jurisdictions,
and patient groups. Our outcome is restricted to recorded deaths and does not account for
undetected mortality. Also, our findings may have been subject to compliance bias because
adherence to MMT may indicate unmeasured behaviours that, in turn, have an influence on
mortality. The magnitude of the protective effects of methadone from nonexternal causes of
death should be interpreted with caution because our results and analyses do not take into

 account methadone prescribed in hospitals or other care facilitates (e.g., hospice); however,
this limitation does not affect the magnitude of effect for external causes of mortality. Receipt
of methadone treatment may be accompanied by psychosocial supports (e.g., counselling sup-
ports, Alcoholics Anonymous [AA], Narcotics Anonymous [NA], etc.) with varying degrees of
participation by individuals. Involvement with ancillary supports was not accounted for in our
analyses and may have altered treatment adherence. Methadone prescribing in BC almost uni-
versally involves witnessed methadone ingestion, and therefore our use of pharmacy dispens-
ing records provides a strong basis for inferring methadone adherence. Disruptions to
treatment, such as access or relocation, were not assessed and may have influenced our results.
The influence of other opioid prescriptions (buprenorphine and buprenorphine-naloxone)
prior to or during the observation period was minimal (approximately 1% of the total opiate
agonist prescriptions between 2008 and 2015); however, their exclusion is a limitation to our
study. Lastly, we did not account for methadone dose, which has been shown to be related to
mortality outcomes [75]; therefore, research examining the relationship between dose and
mortality is needed, as is research investigating additional opiate treatments (e.g., suboxone).
Conclusion
In a large cohort of Canadian convicted offenders, rates of mortality were significantly lower
during periods when individuals were dispensed methadone compared with periods in which
they were not dispensed methadone. Our findings strongly indicate that efforts to increase
methadone adherence may reduce mortality in high-risk populations such as opioid-depen-
dent offenders. Our findings warrant examination in other study centres in response to the cri-
sis of opiate-involved deaths.
