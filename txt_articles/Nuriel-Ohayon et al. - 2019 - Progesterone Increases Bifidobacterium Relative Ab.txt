SUMMARY
Gestation is accompanied by alterations in the micro-
bial repertoire; however, the mechanisms driving
these changes are unknown. Here, we demonstrate
a dramatic shift in the gut microbial composition of
women and mice during late pregnancy, including
an increase in the relative abundance of Bifidobacte-
rium. Using in-vivo-transplanted pellets, we found
that progesterone, the principal gestation hormone,
affects the microbial community. The effect of pro-
gesterone
on
the
richness
of
several
bacteria
species, including Bifidobacterium, was also demon-
strated in vitro, indicating a direct effect. Altogether,
our results delineate a model in which proges-
terone promotes Bifidobacterium growth during late
pregnancy.
INTRODUCTION
Pregnancy is accompanied by alterations in the oral, skin,
vaginal, and gut microbial profiles (Aagaard et al., 2012; DiGiulio
et al., 2015; Koren et al., 2012; Nuriel-Ohayon et al., 2016).
Among these, the most drastic effects are associated with
the gut microbiota, which undergoes changes that partially
resemble those observed in metabolic syndrome (Pitlik and
Koren, 2017). These changes include increased abundance of
Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and opportunistic pathogens
and a decrease in short chain fatty acid producers and in species
richness, all occurring as pregnancy progresses (Koren et al.,
2012). Some of the characteristics of pregnancy, e.g., weight
gain and low-grade inflammation, were transferrable to germ-
free (GF) mice following fecal transplants from pregnant women,
indicating a causative role for the gut microbiota in some of the
pregnancy phenotypes (Koren et al., 2012).
Progesterone levels increase dramatically during pregnancy,
and it plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining gestation
(Mesiano, 2001). Although some links between the endocrine
system and the microbiota have been previously described, un-
derstanding of the precise interactions between the endocrine
system and the microbiota is still limited (Neuman et al., 2015).
Here,
we
demonstrate
that
progesterone
modulates
the
pregnancy-associated gut microbial composition, including an
increase in the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium. Thereby,
progesterone regulates the microbial composition during preg-
nancy in a way that may facilitate both the pregnant mother
and perhaps also appropriate transmission of beneficial species
to the neonate.
RESULTS
Pregnancy-Associated Microbiota of Women and Mice
Is Enriched with Bifidobacterium
It has previously been demonstrated by sequencing the V2 re-
gion of the 16S rRNA gene that the gut microbiota changes
throughout gestation in women (Koren et al., 2012). Because
we currently know that V2 primers fail to identify several species
in the gut microbiome (Sim et al., 2012), to increase the species
coverage, we sequenced the V4 region, an additional variable re-
gion in the 16S rRNA gene. Our analysis of a new sample set con-
sisting of 35 women in both their 1st and 3rd trimesters (Table S1)
demonstrated significant differences in 3rd trimester microbiota
as compared to the 1st trimester (Figure 1A). By sequencing
the V4 region, we were able to observe a significant enrichment
in genera such as Neisseria, Blautia, Collinsella, and Bifidobacte-
rium (Figures 1A and 1B) as pregnancy progressed. We also
observed a decrease in the levels of Clostridium, Dehalobacte-
rium, and an unclassified Bacteroidales. The most abundant
changes at the genus level are summarized in Figure S1.
To study the mechanisms underlying the interaction between
pregnancy and the microbiota, we next used a murine model.
As expected, as pregnancy progressed, pregnant female mice
gained weight as compared to their control counterparts (Fig-
ure S2A), and dynamic changes in the beta (between samples)
diversity of the gut microbial composition were observed at
embryonic day 18 (E18) of pregnancy (Figure 2A). Changes
were observed at several taxonomic levels when comparing
E18 versus E0 (Figure 2B; Figure S2B). As we observed in
women, the levels of the genus Bifidobacterium were signifi-
cantly elevated (�4.3-fold higher average when compared to
non-pregnant controls; Figure 2C). These results demonstrate

 that Bifidobacterium responds to the late pregnancy conditions
in mice as in women.
Progesterone Enriches the Presence of Bifidobacterium
In Vivo
To explore the potential contribution of progesterone to the
observed changes in gut microbial compositions during preg-
nancy, we implanted progesterone subcutaneously (releasing
ca. 1.67 mg/day) as well as placebo pellets, for 21 days in female
mice. Progesterone treatment successfully raised serum pro-
gesterone levels versus the placebo treatment, as measured
on days 11 and 21 (Figure S3).
Microbial analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool
samples from progesterone- versus placebo-treated mice re-
vealed distinct microbial compositions. Linear Discriminant
Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) characterization of the microbiota
on day 18 revealed that the relative abundance of Archaea was
significantly elevated in the progesterone-treated group versus
placebo due to an increased abundance of Methanobrevibacter.
Additional genera that were more abundant in the progesterone-
treated
group
included
Lachnospira
and
unclassified
Clostridiaceae (Figure 3A). Most significantly, progesterone sup-
plementation led to increased relative abundance of Bifidobac-
trium (0.23% versus 0.0007% of total bacteria on day 18, p =
0.0007; Figures 3A and 3B). To tease out which bacterial
changes
were
most
probably
due
to
progesterone,
we
compared the microbiota of pregnant mice with that of proges-
terone- and placebo-treated mice. We searched for bacteria
that increased in the first two groups and decreased in the
placebo group. A heatmap comparing the relative abundance
of microbial changes (Figure 3C) demonstrated Turicibacter
(previously shown to also increase in pregnant rats and mice
[Elderman et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2016]), Anaeroplasma, and
Bifidobacterium as the bacteria that were most likely influenced
by the increased levels of progesterone. Together, these findings
strongly suggest that some of the pregnancy-associated micro-
bial alterations, such as an increased relative abundance of
Bifidobacterium, are mediated by progesterone.
Progesterone Directly Increases the Relative
Abundance of Bifidobacterium In-Vitro
To assess a potential direct effect of progesterone on the micro-
biota, we carried out an in vitro experiment where either proges-
terone or PBS (control) were added to fecal slurry from a female
mouse and incubated at 37�C under anaerobic conditions for
11 days. Dramatic effects on microbiota composition, measured
by unweighted UniFrac, were observed in the cultures grown
with
progesterone
(Figure
4A).
In
addition,
progesterone
also significantly influenced alpha diversity, as the microbial
composition following progesterone treatment was significantly
less diverse than that of the control (Figures 4B and 4C;
Table S2). Some of the genera that increased during the proges-
terone treatment were Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Bacter-
oides, Ruminococcus, Veillonella, Sutterella, and Lactobacillus
(Table S2). Of specific interest, progesterone treatment dramat-
ically increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium
(16.13% in progesterone versus 2.49% in control, p = 0.0043;
Figure 4D).
DISCUSSION
Significant alterations in the gut microbiota between the 1st and
3rd trimesters of pregnancy have been documented, including
changes in diversity, certain phyla, and specific genera (Koren
et al., 2012). However, due to the choice of the sequenced
variable region (region V2 of the 16S rRNA), not all of the bacterial
changes were previously identified. We, therefore, wished to test
a different region of the 16S rRNA gene in analysis of the micro-
bial populations in a cohort of pregnant women from Israel.
To this end, we analyzed the gut microbiota of 35 women in
their 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, in a pairwise manner,
using the primers for the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
We found that the generally dominant bacteria during preg-
nancy were Blautia, Bifidobacterium (important for human milk
oligosaccharide
(HMO)
degradation
[Nuriel-Ohayon
et
al.,
2016]), unclassified Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroides, unclassi-
fied Lachnospiraceae, unclassified Clostridiales, Akkermansia,

 Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, and Prevotella (known to
metabolize estradiol and progesterone [Kornman and Loesche,
1982]) (Figure S1). The genera that increased most significantly
in the 3rd versus 1st trimester were Bifidobacterium, Neisseria,
Blautia, and Collinsella. On the other hand, the genera Dehalo-
bacterium and Clostridium as well as the Bacteroidales order
were significantly higher in the 1st trimester versus the 3rd.
To
further
identify
the
pregnancy-associated
microbial-
sensing signals, we studied pregnant mice. As expected, the
mice gained weight during pregnancy. Bifidobacterium was the
only genus that was elevated in the gut microbiota of both
women and mice in the late stages of pregnancy, suggesting
that Bifidobacterium responds to the conditions of late preg-
nancy in mice as in women. It is important to note that
although in both human and mouse models we observed an
increase in the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, the natu-
ral abundance of this species during a non-pregnancy state
differs between mice and humans (�0.004% versus �5%,
respectively).
In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated the causative
role of progesterone on Bifidobacterium proliferation. It is
important to emphasize that the selection of anaerobic condi-
tions and a specific growth medium may have restricted our
in vitro observations to only a subset of the true gut microbial
potential and may have promoted the growth of species that
do not normally thrive within the gut. Furthermore, the proges-
terone concentration used in the in vitro experiment (80 ng/mL)
was initially higher than physiological levels in mice, perhaps
more comparable to levels in human pregnancy (Kumar and
Magon, 2012) and may not have stayed stable throughout the
experiment. Nonetheless, the differences between groups
were robust enough to lead to the conclusion that progesterone
has a broad effect on microbiota composition, which deserves
further study.
Female hormones have previously been described to pro-
mote
the
proliferation
of
multiple
bacterial
species.
For
example, several bacterial species, such as Lactobacillus, Bifi-
dobacterium, Streptococcus, and Escherichia coli, were iso-
lated from the follicular fluid during in vitro fertilization (IVF)
(Pelzer et al., 2012), and addition of in vitro progesterone to
the follicular fluid stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium
spp. among others species (Pelzer et al., 2012). The low

 abundance of Bifidobacteria may reflect a dysregulated hor-
monal equilibrium.
Bifidobacterium may be important for positive pregnancy out-
comes, as reduced relative abundance of Bifidobacterium is
associated with preterm birth (Dahl et al., 2017). Additionally,
Bifidobacterium may be beneficial for the pregnant mother
by moderating weight gain, improving insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance, and boosting the immune system. In a study
in which Bifidobacterium breve was given to mice fed a high-fat
diet, the probiotic decreased weight gain (Kondo et al., 2010).
Interestingly, even a sterilized culture of Bifidobacteria managed
to suppress fat accumulation, improve insulin resistance, and
lower blood glucose levels in mice on a high-fat diet (Kikuchi
et al., 2018). Other studies have shown that oral administration
of Bifidobacterium spp. improved insulin resistance and glucose
tolerance in mice and rat cells by reducing inflammation and
affecting both glucose and lipid metabolism (Kim et al., 2014;
Le et al., 2014). In terms of effects on the immune system, Bifido-
bacteria have been shown to interact with human immune cells
and to modulate specific pathways, involving innate and adap-
tive immune processes (Ruiz et al., 2017). Colonization of mice
with Bifidobacterium bifidum resulted in increased levels of inter-
leukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 cytokines, presumably through nuclear
factor kB (NF-kB) activation (Turroni et al., 2014). Supplementa-
tion of Bifidobacterium has also been shown to elevate fecal
levels of immunoglobulin A in young women (Kabeerdoss
et al., 2011), perhaps playing defense roles in the gastrointes-
tinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts (Woof and Kerr, 2006).
Bifidobacteria are clearly critical members of the newborn mi-
crobiota repertoire, as they are lactic-acid-producing bacteria
that have the ability to metabolize HMOs (Ba
¨ ckhed et al., 2015;
Turroni et al., 2017). It has also been shown that Bifidobacteria

are passed from mother to infant during
vaginal birth because specific Bifidobac-
terium species from the mother’s prena-
tal feces have been found in the feces
of infants born vaginally but not by cesar-
ean delivery (Makino et al., 2011; Nuriel-Ohayon et al., 2016).
They are also transferred through breast milk (Nuriel-Ohayon
et al., 2016). The passage of Bifidobacteria from mother to
infant may explain the importance of high levels of this genus
during late pregnancy; besides its ability to degrade HMOs,
Bifidobacteria also have an important role in the maturation of
the immune system in the first period of life, as studies have
shown that reduced levels of Bifidobacteria in newborns are
linked with disease states (Ruiz et al., 2017). Therefore, we hy-
pothesize that the elevation in Bifidobacterium during late preg-
nancy may not only be beneficial for pregnancy but may also
reflect an evolutionary process of preparation for birth and
lactation.
What could be the mechanisms underlying the selective
growth of Bifidobacterium in the presence of progesterone
both in vivo and in vitro? One option might be due to the
presence of the enzyme hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD)
which is involved in steroid metabolism and is abundant
in members of the Actinobacteria phylum (Kisiela et al.,
2012), specifically in Bifidobacteria (see Method Details). Alter-
natively, a yet unidentified Bifidobacterium regulator senses
progesterone.
In summary, our study demonstrates an increase in the rela-
tive abundance of Bifidobacterium in the 3rd trimester of preg-
nancy in both humans and mice, as well as in models of
progesterone supplementation. These findings, which provide
insights into the understanding of the relationship between hor-
mones and the gut microbiota during pregnancy, may be rele-
vant not only for pregnancy but also for other conditions in
which hormones are involved, including progesterone supple-
mentation as a component of fertility treatments or therapy in
women at menopause.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human Subjects and data collection
Fecal samples were collected from 35 healthy pregnant Israeli women between the ages of 23–42 years, with no pregnancy
complications. All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the institutional review board of Clalit health services
(Approval number 0135-15) and Rabin medical center (Approval number 0263-15), and informed consent was obtained.
Fecal samples were collected at 12-14 weeks (1st trimester) and 34-36 weeks (3rd trimester). Fresh fecal samples were collected
using FecesCatcher (ZymoResearch, Tustin, CA), and then frozen immediately at �80�C in sterile 50 mL tubes until DNA
purification.
Experimental animals
All mice used in the study were 8-10 week-old dams of the Swiss Webster strain. Mice were housed and bred in the same
room, under specific pathogen- free conditions with a 12h light/dark cycle and maintained at 22�C ± 1. Pregnant dams were
single-housed, whereas all other mice were group housed (2-3 mice/ cage). All mice were given free access to food and water
and were fed from the same food batch (Harlan-Teklad, Madison, WI). In each experiment, mice were randomly assigned to
experimental groups. The day of randomization into groups was considered as day 0. Blood samples were collected from
the facial vein into 1ml heparin tubes kept on ice (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany). Plasma was separated by
centrifugation at 1,500 g for 20 mins at 4�C, and kept frozen at �20�C until analysis. All experimental procedures were
approved by the Bar-Ilan University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol numbers 40-06-2016, 39-06-
2016 and 20-04-2015)

 METHOD DETAILS
Pregnancy mouse model
Fecal samples from 8-week old female Swiss Webster mice were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: (a) control-naive
(n = 11), and (b) mated (n = 10). Pregnancy was confirmed in the mated group by the appearance of a vaginal plug that defined
day E1 of gestation. Fecal samples were collected at days E0 and E18 for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and frozen immediately
at �80�C.
Progesterone implanted mouse model
Female mice were randomly assigned into one of two groups that were implanted with pellets releasing: (a) 35mg progesterone (n = 7)
or (b) placebo pellets containing only matrix without progesterone (n = 9)(Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL). Pellets
containing progesterone or placebo pellets were implanted subcutaneously in the lateral side of the neck between the ear and
the shoulder of the mice and lasted 21 days.
Throughout the experiment, fecal samples were collected on days 0 and 11 for gut microbiota analysis. Plasma levels of proges-
terone were measured by competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay using IMMULITE 2000 (Diagnostic product corporation).
Samples were stored at �80�C prior to the assay.
Fecal microbiota analysis
DNA was extracted from all fecal samples using the PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions following a preliminary step of beadbeating for 2 minutes and elution in 50 ml. Purified DNA was PCR amplified
using PrimeSTAR Max (Takara-Clontech, Shiga, Japan) for the variable V4 region (using 515F-806R barcoded primers) of the 16S
rRNA gene, as previously described (Caporaso et al., 2012). Amplicons were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and subsequently quantified using Quant-It Picogreen dsDNA quantitation kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Equimolar amounts of DNA from individual samples were pooled and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform at the
Genomic Center of the Bar-Ilan University, at the Azrieli Faculty of Medicine.
In vitro anaerobic bacterial culture
Fecal matter from a naive adult Swiss Webster female was resuspended in 6 mL PBS in an anaerobic chamber (90% N2, 5% CO2,
5% H2), vortexed for 5 minutes, and allowed to settle by gravity for 5 min. The supernatant was divided into two tubes: 2.5 mL of the
supernatant was added to a tube containing Depo Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate, Pfizer, Belgium) to a final concentration
of 80 ng/ml (n = 6), or an equal volume of PBS (n = 5). Suspensions were transferred into anaerobic blood culture bottles enriched with
soybean-casein digest broth. Vials were incubated at 37�C. After 11 days, 1 mL of bacterial culture was centrifuged (10,000 RPM for
5 minutes) and bacterial cells were harvested for microbiota composition analysis using the PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio,
Carlsbad, CA).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed using PRISM 7.0a. Weight and progesterone values were compared between groups using
multiple t tests. All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Asterisks in figures indicate significance (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, **p <
0.001). False discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p values were calculated for multiple comparisons. The number of mice per group is
annotated in the figure legends.
Bioinformatics and microbiome analysis
Microbial communities were analyzed using QIIME version 1.8.0 (Caporaso et al., 2010). Paired–end sequences were grouped into
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the GreenGenes (DeSantis et al., 2006) database, and sequences with a similarity of 97% or
greater were grouped into the same OTU. Chimeric sequences were removed, and rarefaction was carried out using 10,000 and
6,200 sequences per sample (for mouse and human pregnancies, respectively), 10,130 sequences per sample (for in-vitro studies),
and 13,000 sequences per sample (for the mouse pellet experiments). Beta diversity was measured using UniFrac (Lozupone and
Knight, 2005). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of the effect size (LEfSe) was used to identify significantly differentiating OTUs
and genera among groups (Segata et al., 2011).
Calour analysis
For identification of differentially abundant bacteria between the control and progesterone groups, samples were rarified to
10,130 reads/sample, and all OTUs with less than 10 reads total over all the samples were filtered out. Differentially abundant bacteria
were identified using the rank-mean test statistic (i.e., difference in the means of the rank transformed frequencies of each OTU)
compared to 1,000 random permutations. False discovery rate was controlled using the dsFDR test (Jiang et al., 2017), which is a
e2

 permutation-based FDR control algorithm, designed to handle sparse data (such as microbiome abundance tables), with a threshold
of 0.1. The resulting 205 OTUs were sorted according to the effect size (mean-rank difference). The differential abundance analysis
and heatmap plot were prepared using Calour (Xu et al., 2019).
Normalization
Given the large variation in OTU values, we transformed these values to Z scores by adding a minimal value to each OTU level (0.01)
and calculating the 10-basis log of each value. Statistical Whitening was then performed on the table, by removing the average and
dividing by the standard deviation of each OTU.
Correlations
ANOVA was performed to find the most significant difference between bacteria in each condition (progesterone/placebo/pregnancy)
and only bacteria with a p value less than 0.05 were considered significant (Figure 3C).
Bioinformatic analysis of HSD sequences
We extracted the Bifidobacterium longum HSD gene sequence from Ensembl bacteria (Kersey et al., 2018) (ENAjCEF11898.1).
This sequence was blasted (Altschul et al., 1990) against all nucleotide collections and while having a high similarity with the
Bifidobacterium longum complete genome (accession number: NC_004307.2), and the Bifidobacterium breve genome, no similar-
ities were found between the HSD gene in the Bifidobacterium to this gene in other species, such as human, mouse, or even other
Actinobacteria (Mycobacterium).
