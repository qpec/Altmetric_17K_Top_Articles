Aim Identify injury-related, patient-reported and 
treatment-related prognostic factors for 5-year outcomes 
in acutely ACL-ruptured individuals managed with early 
reconstruction plus exercise therapy, exercise therapy 
plus delayed reconstruction or exercise therapy alone.
Methods Exploratory analysis of the Knee Anterior 
Cruciate Ligament, Nonsurgical versus Surgical Treatment 
(KANON) trial (ISRCTN84752559). Relationships 
between prognostic factors (baseline cartilage, meniscus 
and osteochondral damage, baseline extension 
deficit, baseline patient-reported outcomes, number 
of rehabilitation visits, graft/contralateral ACL rupture, 
non-ACL surgery and ACL treatment strategy) and 
5-year Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score 
(KOOS) pain, symptoms, sport/recreation and quality 
of life (QOL) scores were explored using multivariable 
linear regression. Estimates were adjusted for sex, age, 
body mass index, preinjury activity level, education and 
smoking.
results For all participants (n=118), graft/contralateral 
ACL rupture, non-ACL surgery and worse baseline 
36-item Short-Form Mental Component Scores were 
associated with worse outcomes. Treatment with exercise 
therapy alone was a prognostic factor for less knee 
symptoms compared with early reconstruction plus 
exercise therapy (regression coefficient 10.1, 95% CI 2.3 
to 17.9). Baseline meniscus lesion was associated with 
worse sport/recreation function (−14.4, 95% CI −27.6 
to –1.3) and osteochondral lesions were associated with 
worse QOL (−12.3, 95% CI −24.3 to –0.4) following 
early reconstruction plus exercise therapy. In the same 
group, undergoing additional non-ACL surgery and 
worse baseline KOOS scores were prognostic for worse 
outcome on all KOOS subscales. Following delayed 
reconstruction, baseline meniscus damage was a 
prognostic factor for less pain (14.3, 95% CI 0.7 to 
27.9). Following exercise therapy alone, undergoing non-
ACL surgery was prognostic for worse pain.
Conclusions Treatment-dependent differences in 
prognostic factors for 5-year outcomes may support 
individualised treatment after acute ACL rupture in young 
active individuals.

InTrOduCTIOn
In 1983, one of the first literature reviews 
discussing surgical and non-operative management 
for ACL rupture concluded that ‘in the future, we 
hope to be able to discern more accurately which 
acute ACL ruptures need surgical treatment’.1 Thir-
ty-three 
years later, evidence-based recommenda-
tions to guide optimal selection of non-operative 
or surgical management strategies for the acutely 
ACL-injured patient have not been established. 
Systematic reviews have found similar long-term 
outcomes (physical activity levels, pain, symp-
toms, knee osteoarthritis and quality of life (QOL)) 
following ACL reconstruction and non-operative 
management of ACL rupture, although most studies 
have been of poor methodological quality and very 
few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) exist.2–5 
The only high-quality treatment RCT of the 
ruptured ACL, the KANON trial, found no differ-
ence in patient-reported, structural or functional 
outcomes at 2 and 5 
years following randomisa-
tion to early reconstruction plus exercise therapy 
versus exercise therapy with optional delayed ACL 
reconstruction.6 7 Irrespective of treatment strategy, 
a proportion of individuals experience persistent 
knee difficulties and unsatisfactory outcomes 
following ACL rupture.2 4 8–13
Multiple studies have identified prognostic factors 
for poor postoperative outcomes following ACL 
reconstruction. Meniscal injury, concomitant meniscal 
surgery and full-thickness cartilage damage at the time 
of ACL reconstruction have been associated with 
worse outcomes (pain, symptoms, function, activity 
levels and QOL) up to 16 years after surgery.14–21 
Psychological factors such as external locus of 
control, fear of reinjury and reduced knee self-effi-
cacy have also been associated with poor functional 
and patient-reported outcomes after ACL recon-
struction.22–28 Additionally, smoking and low educa-
tion levels have predicted worse ACL reconstruction 
 
outcomes.17 29
Factors associated with an unsatisfactory long-
term outcome following ACL rupture may differ in 
ACL-reconstructed and non-operatively managed 
persons. Better understanding of such differences 
could support individualised treatment choices to 
optimise outcomes following ACL rupture. Using 
data collected in the KANON trial,6 7 30 the objectives 
of the present study were to identify injury-related, 
patient-reported and treatment-related prognostic 
factors for 5-year patient-reported outcomes in 
ACL-ruptured individuals and to compare prognostic 
factors between the three as-treated groups (early

MeThOds
study design and participants
This is an exploratory ‘as-treated’ analysis from the KANON trial 
(Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN84752559), a prospective 
RCT on surgical versus non-surgical treatment strategies of acute 
ACL rupture. The KANON trial enrolled active adults aged 
18–35 years who presented to the Departments of Orthopaedics 
at Skåne University Hospital, Lund and Helsingborg Hospital, 
Sweden with an acute ACL rupture (injured within the preceding 
4 weeks). Major exclusion criteria were professional athletes, 
less than moderately active individuals, previous knee injury, 
total collateral ligament rupture, full-thickness cartilage lesion 
visualised on MRI and extensive meniscal fixation. We have 
described details of recruitment process, inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and randomisation.6 7 30
The objective of the KANON trial was to compare outcomes 
between individuals randomised to a strategy of early ACL recon-
struction plus supervised exercise therapy (n=62) and supervised 
exercise therapy with the option of having a delayed ACL recon-
struction if needed (n=59). T
wenty-three (39%) of the latter group 
had a delayed ACL reconstruction within the first 2 
years7 and an 
additional 7 had a delayed reconstruction using a similar proce-
dure in the following 3 years.6 One participant from the early 
reconstruction plus exercise therapy group was lost to follow-up 
between baseline and 5 
years. T
wo patients assigned to early recon-
struction plus exercise therapy did not have ACL reconstruction 
or attended <10 rehabilitation visits and were excluded from the 
as-treated analysis, presenting 59, 30 and 29 individuals in the early 
reconstruction plus exercise therapy, exercise therapy plus delayed 
reconstruction and exercise therapy alone groups at 5 
years.6 
Between baseline and 5-year follow-up, two participants received 
a revision ACL reconstruction, two individuals ruptured their ACL 
graft but did not undergo revision surgery and five underwent an 
ACL reconstruction in their contralateral knee (seven participants 
in the early reconstruction plus exercise therapy group and two 
participants in the exercise therapy plus delayed reconstruction 
group). Demographic data, patient-reported outcomes, imaging, 
biomarkers, strength and functional measures were collected at 
baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 5-year 
follow-up.
Treatment strategy
Single-bundle autograft ACL reconstructions were performed 
using the patellar tendon (40 procedures) or hamstring tendon 
(51 procedures) in line with the preference of four senior surgeons 
who performed all procedures. All early ACL reconstructions were 
performed 46 
weeks following randomisation. Timing of delayed 
ACL reconstructions ranged from 2 to 56 months after randomisa-
tion.6 Meniscal tears were treated by partial resection (and in a few 
cases partial fixation) when indicated by MRI and/or clinical find-
ings, either at the time of ACL reconstruction or separately.7 Other 
surgical interventions were done as clinically indicated.7 Partici-
pants from all groups performed the same goal oriented, physio-
therapist supervised neuromuscular exercise therapy programme at 
nine outpatient clinics.7
Five-year outcomes
The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 
is valid for use in ACL-ruptured individuals and has a high 
test–retest reliability in patients with knee injury.31 The 
KOOS comprises five subscales, scored from 0 (worst) to 100 
(best). The subscale addressing function in activities of daily 
living (ADL) is the least applicable to young, active individ-
uals 5 years following ACL rupture, where near to normal 
scores are commonly reported irrespective of impairments in 
the other four subscales.2 10 Therefore, we excluded the ADL 
subscale, but included the other four KOOS subscales (pain, 
symptoms, sport and recreation function (sport/rec), QOL) 
as outcomes.
Prognostic factors
Injury-related factors
Baseline cartilage and meniscus damage, osteochondral lesions 
and knee extension deficit were identified as injury-related 
factors with potential to impact 5-year outcome.
Baseline 1.5 T MRI examinations were used to grade concom-
itant baseline injuries using the Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
OsteoArthritis Score (ACLOAS)32 by a musculoskeletal radiolo-
gist with 11 years experience in standardised semi-quantitative 
MRI assessment of knee pathology and experience with using 
the ACLOAS (FWR). The ACLOAS is a whole joint scoring 
system devised for use in acutely ACL-injured knees covering 
acute osteochondral and other damage as well as pre-existing 
pathology commonly considered to be part of the osteoarthritis 
spectrum.32 All features were dichotomised into presence and 
absence for the purpose of this study (as described below), where 
the highest grade on each scale was taken for each participant. 
A full description of the ACLOAS scoring criteria has been 
published.32
The intraobserver reliability of the ACLOAS instrument 
including longitudinal assessment ranged between 0.52 (base-
line, Hoffa synovitis) and 1.00 (several features), per cent agree-
ment between 52% (all time points, Hoffa synovitis) and 100% 
(several features). Interobserver reliability ranged between 0.00 
and 1.00, which is explained by low frequency of some of the 
features. Altogether, 73% of all assessed 142 parameters showed 
weighted-kappa values between 0.80 and 1.00% and 92% 
showed agreement above 80%.32
Cartilage damage was assessed using all available sequences 
and graded based on percentage of affected area and depth 
of damage in any given subregion. For this study, a cartilage 
defect was defined as a score of 2 (focal partial thickness defect 
affecting ≤10% of subregional area) or above.32
Baseline osteochondral surface damage was assessed in two 
dimensions, type of injury and size. For this study, an osteochon-
dral lesion was defined as a score of ≥1 (subchondral fracture, 
osteochondral depression or detached fracture).32 Using these 
criteria, subchondral traumatic bone marrow lesions without 
a fracture and/or without articular surface damage were not 
considered osteochondral lesions.
Meniscal damage was assessed using sagittal sequences (for the 
anterior and posterior horn regions) and coronal sequences (for 
the meniscal body). For this study, meniscal damage was defined 
as a score of ≥2 (including all meniscal tears and extrusions, not 
including intrameniscal hyperintensity not extending to meniscal 
surface).32
A knee extension deficit >10 degrees at baseline was also 
identified as an injury-related factor with potential to impact 
5-year outcome.

surgical session as early or delayed ACL reconstruction or revision) 
performed between baseline and 5-year follow-up will be described 
as ‘non-ACL surgery’ (categorised into none, one or two or more 
‘non-ACL surgeries’). Experiencing ACL graft rupture or contra-
lateral ACL rupture, the number of rehabilitation visits attended, 
and receiving early reconstruction plus exercise therapy, exercise 
therapy plus delayed reconstruction or exercise therapy alone 
were also identified as treatment-related factors with a potential to 
impact 5-year outcome.
Patient-reported factors
Baseline Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form health 
survey (SF-36) Mental Component Scores (MCS)33 and baseline 
KOOS4 scores (a mean value from pain, symptoms, sport/rec and 
QOL subscales) were included as patient-reported outcomes with 
potential to impact 5-year outcome. The Physical Component 
Score from the SF-36 was not included in analyses due to potential 
collinearity with the KOOS4 and injury-related variables.
Confounders
Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), preinjury activity (assessed using 
the T
egner activity score),7 education (university vs other) and 
smoking (never vs other) were identified as potential confounders 
and included in the adjusted analyses.
statistical analysis
Prognostic factors and confounders were selected using clinical 
reasoning and literature review. Selected variables were portrayed 
in direct acyclic graphs to minimise overadjustment bias and 
collider stratification bias, with reference to a six-step process 
towards unbiased estimates.34 Linear regression analysis was used to 
investigate prognostic factors for 5-year outcome. Since this was an 
exploratory analysis, we made no adjustment for multiple compar-
isons. However, making multiple comparisons with no adjustments 
increases risk of chance findings. All underlying assumptions were 
assessed prior to analyses (including normality, multicollinearity 
between prognostic factors and normality, linearity and homosce-
dasticity of residuals). Since the preinjury T
egner score was nega-
tively skewed and violated several assumptions, it was dichotomised 
using a cut-off of 5–7 (lower-level recreational sport and activities) 
versus 8–9 (higher-level pivoting, contact sport). Variables with 
three categories were transformed to three binary variables for use 
in multivariable analyses and the variable with the greatest sample 
size was used as a reference group. Adjusted effect estimates are 
reported for the entire cohort and within treatment groups in terms 
of regression coefficients and the estimation uncertainty is presented 
using 95% 
CI. Crude effect estimates are presented in an online 
supplementary appendix. Data were incomplete for three variables 
(smoking n=11 missing (9%), BMI n=2 missing (2%), SF-36 MCS 
n=1 missing (1%)). All missing data were assumed to be missing at

Participant characteristics
Participant characteristics including demographics, prognostic 
factors and 5-year KOOS outcomes for each treatment group are 
described in table 1.
All participants (n=118)
After adjustment for potential confounders, experiencing an ACL 
graft rupture or contralateral ACL rupture were prognostic factors 
for more knee pain and symptoms, worse sport and recreation func-
tion and reduced QOL (table 2). Having at least one knee surgery 
not involving ACL reconstruction or revision, was also predictive 
of worse 5-year patient-reported outcomes. Reporting a 5-point 
worse SF-36 MCS at baseline predicted an estimated 1-point worse 
KOOS-pain score at follow-up. Individuals managed with exercise 
therapy alone reported an estimated 10-point better KOOS-symp-
toms score at 5 
years, compared with people who underwent an 
early reconstruction plus exercise therapy (table 2).
Early reconstruction plus exercise therapy (n=59)
Participants who received an early reconstruction plus exercise 
therapy and had baseline meniscus damage reported an estimated 
14-point worse KOOS-sport/rec score at follow-up compared with 
early reconstructed people without baseline meniscus damage 
(table 3). Participants who underwent an early reconstruction 
with baseline osteochondral injury reported an estimated 12-point 
worse KOOS-QOL score at 5 years compared with early recon-
structed individuals without osteochondral injury. Undergoing 
one or more non-ACL surgery following early ACL reconstruction 
was a prognostic factor for worse patient-reported outcomes at 
5 
years (table 3). Worse baseline KOOS4 scores were associated with 
worse knee symptoms, reduced sport and recreation function and 
decreased QOL at 5 
years.
Exercise therapy plus delayed reconstruction (n=30)
In the exercise therapy plus delayed reconstruction group, baseline 
meniscus damage predicted an estimated 14-point better KOOS-
pain score at follow-up compared with no baseline meniscal injury 
(table 4). Experiencing ACL graft rupture or contralateral ACL 
rupture after a delayed reconstruction was a prognostic factor for 
more knee pain, worse sport/recreation function and reduced QOL 
at 5 
years, although only two individuals in this group experienced 
a contralateral ACL or graft rupture.
Exercise therapy alone (n=29)
Participants managed with exercise therapy alone who received 
one non-ACL surgery reported an estimated 14-point worse

KOOS-pain score at 5 
years compared with people remaining

resulTs suMMAry
An overview of prognostic factors for 5-year outcome is provided 
in table 6.
dIsCussIOn
This is the first study to explore prognostic factors for a cohort 
comprising young active individuals with an acutely ruptured 
ACL managed with early reconstruction plus exercise therapy, 
exercise therapy plus delayed reconstruction or exercise therapy 
alone. When all participants were analysed together, graft rupture/
contralateral ACL rupture, non-ACL surgery, worse baseline SF-36 
MCS and undergoing early reconstruction plus exercise therapy 
compared with exercise therapy alone were prognostic factors for 
worse 5-year outcomes on one or more KOOS subscales. Baseline 
cartilage injury, baseline extension deficit and number of rehabili-
tation visits were not related to 5-year outcomes for all participants 
or any of the treatment groups. A further exploratory analysis 
of treatment groups revealed differences in prognostic factors, 
suggesting that delaying ACL reconstruction and managing ACL 
rupture with exercise therapy alone may alter prognostic factors 
for 5-year outcomes in a positive direction. Our findings suggest 
that young, active individuals with acute ACL rupture who have 
concomitant meniscus injury, and those reporting more severe 
knee pain, symptoms and impaired function in the early phase of 
injury, may benefit most from commencing exercise therapy before 
considering ACL reconstruction.
baseline meniscal damage and osteochondral lesions
For the early reconstruction plus exercise therapy group, osteo-
chondral injury was a prognostic factor for worse QOL and 
meniscus damage was related to worse sport and recreation func-
tion at 5 
years. In contrast, baseline meniscus damage was a prog-
nostic factor for less pain at follow-up for the exercise therapy 
plus delayed reconstruction group. The mechanisms behind this 
surprising finding are not clear, but sustaining a second knee insult 
in the form of an early ACL reconstruction shortly after a previous 
knee trauma may increase the likelihood of experiencing persistent 
postoperative difficulties. The additional sequelae of ACL recon-
struction, including surgical trauma to intra-articular structures 
and a period of prolonged joint inflammation and altered weight 
bearing, may provide a suboptimal environment for healing of 
meniscus and other joint tissues, compared with initial manage-
ment with a goal-oriented exercise therapy programme guided by 
knee pain and symptoms.
People with baseline meniscus injury who underwent a delayed 
reconstruction may have experienced more pain related to 
mechanical knee issues (such as instability, persistent swelling or 
limited range of motion) compared with those without meniscus 
injury. Reconstructive surgery may have been more successful 
in relieving pain in this group, compared with those electing to 
undergo surgery for a range of other reasons, including a desire 
to gain preinjury status, a pre-existing preference for surgery and 
finding exercise therapy boring and time consuming.36
These explanations are speculative and further research is 
needed to explore the relationship between management strategies 
for ACL rupture, meniscus damage and long-term outcomes.

ACL reconstruction.37 Subsequent surgery was found to predict 
more knee pain at 2 and 6 years after ACL reconstruction13 and 
worse QOL in people with knee difficulties 5–20 years after ACL 
reconstruction.38 In the present study, undergoing non-ACL surgery 
was related to worse patient-reported outcomes for all partici-
pants, especially for the early reconstruction plus exercise therapy 
group. The reason for worse outcomes in those who underwent 
non-ACL surgery after ACL rupture is unknown. However, it is 
likely that knee pain, symptoms, activity limitations and impaired 
QOL are common drivers of non-ACL surgery, while it is uncer-
tain if these symptoms are relieved by the surgery. Further inves-
tigation is required to assess the effectiveness of specific surgical 
procedures in improving long-term outcomes for people with knee 
difficulties after ACL reconstruction. Including a range of preop-
erative and postoperative patient-reported measures and reporting 
the patient’s and surgeon’s rationale for surgery may provide new 
insights.
ACl graft rupture or contralateral ACl rupture
Our finding of worse 5-year outcomes in people who experi-
ence an ACL graft rupture or contralateral rupture is in line with 
previous research.39–42 Of concern is that as many as one in four 
individuals suffer a graft rerupture or contralateral ACL rupture 
within 15 years of ACL reconstruction43 and this is most common 
in adolescents who undergo ACL reconstruction.44 The possibility 
of sustaining an ACL graft rupture that increases the risk of poor 
long-term outcomes should be discussed with patients weighing up 
ACL management options.
baseline KOOs4 and sF-36 MCs scores
Worse baseline KOOS4 score was a prognostic factor for worse 5-year 
outcomes following early reconstruction plus exercise therapy and 
impaired baseline SF-36 MCS predicted more knee pain at follow-up 
for all participants. Individuals who report worse baseline KOOS4 
and SF-36 MCS may exhibit psychological traits that are associated 
with reporting worse outcomes after ACL reconstruction, such as 
reduced knee self-efficacy, pain catastrophising, pessimism, poor 
knee confidence and external locus of control.22–24 45 46 Low base-
line KOOS4 scores also reflect more physical impairment and this 
may predispose an individual to worse postoperative outcomes. 
Individuals who report worse KOOS scores prior to reconstruction 
may benefit from postponing surgery and commencing exercise 
therapy before considering surgical reconstruction. This suggestion 
is consistent with a prior study showing that 5 
weeks of intensive 
exercise therapy prior to surgery resulted in a better postoperative 
outcome.47 48 Baseline patient-reported and psychological measures 
may be used in future studies to advise individuals better suited to a 
specific ACL management strategy.
early reconstruction plus exercise therapy compared with 
exercise therapy alone
Early reconstruction within 10 weeks of injury plus exercise therapy 
was a prognostic factor for more knee symptoms at 5 
years compared 
with management with exercise therapy alone. It is important to 
note that patients managed with exercise therapy alone in this study 
are not generalisable to all ACL-ruptured patients receiving exercise 
therapy, since those who went on to have a delayed ACL recon-
struction were excluded from this group. Notably, reporting worse 
preoperative KOOS scores prior to early reconstruction plus exer-
cise therapy was related to more knee symptoms at 5 years, but this 
was not the case for individuals treated with exercise therapy plus 
delayed reconstruction. These findings strengthen the possibility 
that commencing exercise therapy and enabling the acute signs 
of injury to subside prior to considering ACL reconstruction may 
benefit long-term outcomes. Surgical reconstruction of the ACL 
causes iatrogenic damage to knee structures, which may increase 
the likelihood of experiencing future knee symptoms compared 
with management with exercise therapy alone. Components of ACL 
reconstruction including surgical incision, graft harvesting and bone 
drilling may contribute to long-term complaints including numb-
ness and altered sensation, kneeling difficulties and patellofemoral 
 
pain.12 49 50

limitations and strengths
This was a post hoc exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of 
outcomes of an RCT on ACL treatment. Due to the exploratory 
nature of this analysis, we did not adjust for multiple comparisons. 
Furthermore, our subgroup analysis resulted in a reduced sample 
size, which may have increased the risk of spurious results and 
reduced the likelihood of finding statistically significant prognostic 
factors, in particular for the exercise therapy alone and exercise 
therapy plus delayed reconstruction groups. This may also explain 
the wide 95% CIs suggesting uncertainty in some of the estimates. 
Considering these limitations, we emphasise that larger prospec-
tive cohort studies are needed before these findings are applied in 
the clinical setting.
Although most estimates exceeded previously reported mini-
mally clinically important difference (MCID) values for the KOOS, 
we refrained from interpreting findings relative to MCID since the 
MCID is likely to be different for patients managed with recon-
struction and those managed with exercise therapy alone. Further-
more, the patient characteristics in the KANON trial differ from 
the characteristics of patients where MCID values were derived, 
making it in appropriate for use in this study.
Our study is the first to explore prognostic factors for long-
term outcome in different treatment groups in a high-quality RCT. 
Further strengths include the depth of baseline data available for 
use as prognostic factors, the low dropout rate over 5 
years and the 
standardised, monitored goal-oriented rehabilitation regime that 
all participants undertook.
Conclusion
This exploratory investigation suggests that young active adults 
with an acute ACL tear to a previously uninjured knee with baseline 
meniscus damage, an osteochondral lesion or more self-reported 
knee impairment, treated with early reconstruction plus exercise 
therapy, may experience worse 5-year outcomes compared with 
those with similar baseline characteristics treated with exercise 
therapy with or without a delayed reconstruction. This informa-
tion may be useful in guiding further research and could assist to 
identify individuals who may benefit most from non-operative or 
surgical management of ACL rupture.

What are the findings?
 
► Delaying ACL reconstruction and managing ACL rupture with 
exercise therapy alone may shift prognostic factors for 5-year 
outcomes in a positive direction.
 
► Individuals reporting worse Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score symptoms, sport/recreation and QOL scores 
following acute ACL rupture may benefit from commencing 
exercise therapy before considering ACL reconstruction.
 
► Research is needed to determine whether individuals with 
baseline meniscus damage benefit from delaying ACL 
reconstruction and commencing exercise therapy.
 
► Further investigation is required to assess the effectiveness of 
specific surgical procedures in improving long-term outcomes 
for people with knee difficulties after ACL reconstruction.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
If further research supports these findings:
 
► Patient characteristics including concomitant meniscus 
damage and a higher degree of self-reported knee 
impairment within 4 weeks of ACL rupture, may be used to 
identify individuals most likely to benefit from commencing 
exercise therapy before considering ACL reconstruction.
 
► To enable an individual with an acute ACL rupture to 
make an informed decision about management options, 
clinicians should provide a personalised discussion regarding 
the likelihood of better or worse outcomes with each 
management option, tailored to the individual’s personal and 
injury-related characteristics.
 
► Clinicians should assure that individuals with knee 
complaints after ACL rupture receive unbiased, evidence-
based information on the benefits and harms associated with 
different management options.
