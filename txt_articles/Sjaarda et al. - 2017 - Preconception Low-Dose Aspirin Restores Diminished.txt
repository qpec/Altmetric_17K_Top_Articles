Context: Inflammation is linked to causes of infertility. Low-dose aspirin (LDA) may improve
reproductive success in women with chronic, low-grade inflammation.
Objective: To investigate the effect of preconception-initiated LDA on pregnancy rate, pregnancy
loss, live birth rate, and inflammation during pregnancy.
Design: Stratified secondary analysis of a multicenter, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial.
Setting: Four US academic medical centers, 2007 to 2012.
Participants: Healthy women aged 18 to 40 years (N = 1228) with one to two prior pregnancy losses
actively attempting to conceive.
Intervention: Preconception-initiated, daily LDA (81 mg) or matching placebo taken up to six
menstrual cycles attempting pregnancy and through 36 weeks’ gestation in women who conceived.
Main Outcome Measures: Confirmed pregnancy, live birth, and pregnancy loss were compared be-
tween LDA and placebo, stratified by tertile of preconception, preintervention serum high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (low, ,0.70 mg/L; middle, 0.70 to ,1.95 mg/L; high, $1.95 mg/L).
Results: Live birth occurred in 55% of women overall. The lowest pregnancy and live birth rates
occurred among the highest hsCRP tertile receiving placebo (44% live birth). LDA increased live birth
among high-hsCRP women to 59% (relative risk, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.67), similar to
rates in the lower and mid-CRP tertiles. LDA did not affect clinical pregnancy or live birth in the low
(live birth: 59% LDA, 54% placebo) or midlevel hsCRP tertiles (live birth: 59% LDA, 59% placebo).
Conclusions: In women attempting conception with elevated hsCRP and prior pregnancy loss, LDA
may increase clinical pregnancy and live birth rates compared with women without inflammation
and reduce hsCRP elevation during pregnancy. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1495–1504, 2017)

 I
nflammation is an increasingly recognized factor con-
tributing to reproductive dysfunction, including several
common causes of infertility such as pelvic inflammatory
disease (1), polycystic ovary syndrome (2), endometriosis
(3), and recurrent pregnancy loss (4). Aspirin, an anti-
inflammatory agent (5), is generally regarded as safe,
widely available, and inexpensive and is used routinely
for prevention of other health complications linked to
inflammation. Specifically, low-dose aspirin (LDA; i.e.,
“baby aspirin,” 81 mg/d) is used to reduce cardiovascular
risk mortality in patients with elevated risk (6, 7), and a
recent report by the 2014 US Preventive Services Task
Force recommended prophylactic use of LDA beginning
at 12 weeks’ gestation for women at high risk of pre-
eclampsia (8). Prior to conception in infertile women,
aspirin therapy showed mixed efficacy in improving
endometrial vascularization, placentation, and preg-
nancy rates resulting from assisted reproductive tech-
nologies (9–12). Lastly, preconception-initiated LDA
resulted in a nonstatistically significant increase in the live
birth rate (58% vs 53% in placebo) among 1228 women
with a history of pregnancy loss participating in the
Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction
(EAGeR) randomized trial.
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is com-
monly used as a biomarker of systemic, chronic inflam-
mation, and moderately elevated hsCRP ($2.11 mg/L)
strongly predicted individuals most likely to exhibit a
statistically significant reduction in myocardial infarction
risk from daily LDA therapy (13). Thus, it is logical to
hypothesize that hsCRP may indicate a systemic, low-grade
inflammatory milieu amenable to daily LDA therapy to
also improve reproductive health outcomes. Furthermore,
in contrast to the paucity of data examining preconception
inflammation and successful reproduction, a growing body
of evidence supports a link between C-reactive protein
measured during pregnancy and risk of pregnancy com-
plications, including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia,
and low birthweight (14–16). Therefore, the aim of this
analysis was to determine the effect of LDA, according to
preconception inflammatory status, on pregnancy rate,
pregnancy loss, live birth rate, and hsCRP elevation during
pregnancy in women attempting pregnancy as part of the
EAGeR randomized trial with a history of one to two
pregnancy losses.
Materials and Methods
The EAGeR trial was a multicenter, block-randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
trial
of
1228
women
recruited from four medical centers in the United States from
2007 to 2012. Institutional review board approval was ob-
tained at each study site and the data coordinating center. All
participants provided written informed consent. A data
safety and monitoring board optimized patient safety. Ad-
verse events were monitored and reported to the data safety
and monitoring board throughout the trial by a committee
blinded to treatment status. The trial was registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00467363. Full details of the study
design, methods, and participant characteristics have been
previously described (17).
Study design and population
Women trying to conceive who were aged 18 to 40 years
with regular menstrual cycles of 21 to 42 days in length, no
known history of infertility, and confirmation of one or two
prior pregnancy losses were eligible for the EAGeR trial. In
the parent trial, participants were block-randomized by
study center and eligibility stratum, which was defined
based on specific eligibility qualifications (17): (1) original
stratum, women with exactly one documented pregnancy
loss ,20 weeks’ gestation during the preceding 12 months
and (2) expanded stratum, women not meeting all criteria for
the original stratum and having one or two prior pregnancy
losses of any gestational age at any time in the past. Exclusion
criteria for all women included but were not limited to clinical
indication for use of anticoagulant therapy or chronic use of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, major medical disorders
(e.g., diabetes, hypertension), and any self-reported history of
physician-diagnosed infertility or subfertility including, but not
limited to, related conditions such as polycystic ovary syn-
drome, endometriosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (17).
However, no specific testing was conducted to rule out such
conditions at study entry. The overall and eligibility stratum-
specific effects of LDA on live birth, the primary outcome of the
EAGeR trial, have been reported (18).
Recruitment occurred primarily by physician/nurse re-
ferral within clinical sites in participating medical centers and
was supplemented with household mailings, local health
promotion events, posters, social media, brochures, and local
media (19). Eligible women were scheduled for a baseline
(prerandomization) visit to coincide with days 2 to 4 of their
menstrual cycle.
Treatment and study procedures
Participants were block-randomized 1:1 using a computer-
ized algorithm by study center and eligibility stratum (original/
expanded) to receive either the intervention [81 mg LDA plus
400 mg folic acid daily (n = 615; 275 original, 340 expanded)] or
placebo [plus 400 mg folic acid (n = 613; 274 original, 339
expanded)]. Treatment assignment was implemented by the
data coordinating center; participants, clinicians, and in-
vestigators were blinded to treatment status. Study pills were
taken daily until completion of six cycles of follow-up while
attempting pregnancy or until week 36 of gestation for those
who became pregnant.
Participants attended two study visits per menstrual cycle for
the first two cycles attempting pregnancy and once per cycle
thereafter. Visits were timed to occur around ovulation and days
2 to 4 of the expected next cycle (postcycle visit). Fertility
monitors were used to assist with timing of intercourse to
optimize conception and scheduling study visits (Clearblue Easy
Fertility Monitor; Swiss Precision Diagnostics, Petit-Lancy,
Switzerland). In women becoming pregnant, blood was col-
lected at study visits scheduled approximately monthly through
36 weeks’ gestation.

 Outcome measures
Primary outcomes for the present analysis were clinically
confirmed pregnancy and live birth. Clinically confirmed
pregnancies were identified by intrauterine gestational sac on
ultrasound at 6 to 7 weeks’ gestation, clinical recording of fetal
heart tones, or clinical confirmation of pregnancy at a later
stage. Ectopic pregnancies (n = 6) were categorized as clinical
pregnancy losses but not clinically confirmed pregnancies. Live
birth was documented via abstraction of medical records. For
women with no clinically confirmed pregnancy, follow-up
ended after six menstrual cycles or after two pregnancy los-
ses, whichever occurred first.
Pregnancy losses were also examined as a secondary out-
come. Clinically confirmed losses were defined as losses oc-
curring after clinical confirmation of pregnancy. Human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)–detected losses were preg-
nancies detected by hCG testing but not confirmed by ultra-
sound (n = 55). An hCG-detected pregnancy was determined
from a positive result on a “real-time” urine pregnancy test
(Quidel Quickvue; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA),
which was sensitive to 25 mIU/mL hCG, conducted each
time participants reported missing menses on any postcycle
visit (n = 34), or from batched urine hCG testing performed
after study completion on stored samples from the last 10 days
of each woman’s first and second cycle of study participa-
tion (using daily first-morning urine collected at home) and on
spot urine samples collected at all postcycle visits (n = 21)
(17, 18).
Biochemical analysis
C-reactive protein was measured in serum samples collected
at the baseline (prerandomization) study visit (days 2 to 4 of
menses), in addition to samples collected at 8, 20, and 36 weeks’
gestation. An immunoturbidimetric assay using a Roche
COBAS 6000 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN) was used to measure hsCRP to a limit of detection of
0.15 mg/L. Interassay coefficients of variation were 5.1% at
1.05 mg/L and 6.7% at 3.12 mg/L.
Statistical analysis
All analyses followed intent-to-treat principles in that
analyses were completed according to assigned treatment, and
no exclusions were made based on treatment compliance. As
such, all women were included in analyses, except for 140
women who withdrew prior to observing the primary out-
come (i.e., live birth) and an additional 19 women who did not
have hsCRP assessed at baseline (Fig. 1). Baseline charac-
teristics of women with missing hsCRP were similar to those
with measured hsCRP, except that women with missing
hsCRP were less likely to have greater than high school ed-
ucation (P = 0.007).
Log binomial models with robust variance were used to
estimate the risk ratio of LDA vs placebo for outcomes of
clinically confirmed pregnancy, live birth, and pregnancy loss in
the total group, stratified by baseline hsCRP tertile (low, ,0.73
mg/L; middle, 0.73 to ,2.24 mg/L; high, $2.24 mg/L). Tertiles
of hsCRP were applied to ensure equivalent sample size to
enhance statistical power to detect an effect within each level of
hsCRP. Models were repeated, and all subsequent analysis
was conducted after excluding 55 (28 LDA, 27 placebo)
women with hsCRP $10 mg/L, a level noted in previous
literature to be consistent with recent or ongoing acute causes of
hsCRP elevation (e.g., infection, injury) as opposed to chronic
low-grade immune activation (low, ,0.70 mg/L; middle,
0.70 to ,1.95 mg/L; high, $1.95 mg/L after excluding
hsCRP $10 mg/L) (20, 21). The proportion of hsCRP $10 mg/L
in our study population of ;5% was expected in this relatively
healthy group of women (22). Furthermore, using available
diary entries from 1 day prior to 2 days after the hsCRP
measurement at the randomization visit, report of any illness or
side effects was 2.5 times as common among women with
hsCRP $10 mg/L than those with hsCRP ,10 mg/L (25% vs
11%, P = 0.002). Unfortunately, data on illness prior to 1 day
before the blood draw were not available, limiting a full
characterization of potentially relevant acute illness. Tertiles of
hsCRP were used to evenly divide the study population;
however, the resulting cut-point defining the top tertile
(1.95 mg/L) was similar to definitions of high hsCRP used by
others (23, 24).
To examine the effect of LDA on pregnancy and live birth
among women with low-grade inflammation (third tertile,
hsCRP $1.95 mg/L) separately by adiposity status, analysis was
stratified by above and below the median waist-to-hip ratio as a
proxy of central adiposity, as well as by normal [body mass
index (BMI) ,25 kg/m2] and overweight/obese (BMI $25 kg/m2)
body mass.
Lastly, generalized estimating equations models were used to
evaluate treatment group differences in log-transformed hsCRP
longitudinally across pregnancy, stratified by baseline hsCRP
tertile. For this analysis to correctly estimate the effect of LDA
on log(hsCRP) across pregnancy, inverse probability weights
were implemented to control for potential bias introduced by
restricting the analysis postrandomization to only women be-
coming pregnant (25, 26).
Because treatment allocation was randomized, all models
evaluating the effect of LDA are reported without adjustment
for any covariates. Consistent with analysis of a randomized
trial, adjustment for age, BMI, marital status, and income did
not appreciably change estimates, and findings remained un-
changed (data not shown). All analyses were conducted in SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The number needed to
treat with confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated using a
standard calculator (http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/
NNT1; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Results
A total of 1228 women were recruited and randomly
assigned to LDA or placebo between 15 June 2007 and 15
July 2011 and followed up until August 2012. Participants
were predominantly white (95%), married or living with a
partner (98%), educated (86% more than high school
education), and employed (76%) (Table 1). With increasing
hsCRP tertile, BMI increased (P , 0.001), waist-to-hip ratio
increased (P , 0.001), education level decreased (P = 0.01),
and time since the last pregnancy loss increased (P = 0.01).
The overall pregnancy and live birth rates of the study
were 67% (n = 732) and 55% (n = 597), respectively. The
mean (standard deviation) concentration of hsCRP was
2.79 (5.16) mg/L, and median (interquartile range) was

 1.19 (0.55 to 3.20) mg/L, representing the expected right-
skewed distribution of hsCRP concentrations.
Among women in the lowest and middle hsCRP ter-
tiles, clinically confirmed pregnancies did not differ by
treatment (lowest hsCRP, 70% LDA, 68% placebo;
middle hsCRP, 72% LDA, 67% placebo). However,
among those with the highest hsCRP, clinical pregnancy
rates were 71% (LDA) and 54% (placebo) (Fig. 2). As
such, LDA treatment was associated with a 31% increase
in clinically confirmed pregnancy incidence among
women in the highest hsCRP tertile (Table 2). Similarly,
live birth did not differ by treatment in the lower hsCRP
tertiles (lowest hsCRP, 59% LDA, 54% placebo; middle
hsCRP, 59% LDA, 59% placebo), but live birth was
lower (44%) among women receiving placebo in the
high-hsCRP group compared with 59% receiving LDA
(Fig. 2). As such, LDA was associated with a 35% in-
crease in live birth among women in the highest hsCRP
tertile (Table 2). Results summarized previously reflect
the population of women with hsCRP ,10 mg/L as this
level of hsCRP likely reflects chronic low-grade in-
flammation, as opposed to acute immune activation at-
tributable to recent or ongoing injury or infection (20,
21). However, results both including and excluding
women with hsCRP $10 mg/L are presented (Table 2).
Overall, the number needed to treat was seven women
(95% CI, 3.9 to 23.8) within the highest hsCRP tertile for
every additional live birth observed, whereas the effect of
LDA among all women (i.e., without hsCRP screening)
was not statistically significant (number needed to treat =
19; 95% CI, 8.9 if helpful to 158.3 if harmful).
Further examination of live birth restricted to women
with high hsCRP (hsCRP $ 1.95 mg/L), stratified by
waist-to-hip ratio as a measure of central adiposity,
showed a positive effect of LDA on live birth among
women with a waist-to-hip below the median [relative
risk (RR), 1.60; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.30) and a weaker effect
among women above the waist-to-hip median (RR, 1.18;
95% CI, 0.89 to 1.56). Repeating this analysis, stratifying
instead on normal BMI (n = 81; median hsCRP, 3.27 mg/L;
interquartile range, 2.26 to 4.63) vs overweight/obese
BMI (n = 293; median hsCRP, 3.99; interquartile range,
2.89 to 5.35), produced similar results with an increase in
live birth among normal-weight women (LDA 76% vs
placebo 50%; RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.35) but no
statistically significant increase among overweight/obese

 women (LDA 49% vs placebo 42%; RR, 1.16; 95% CI,
0.88 to 1.53).
LDA had no effect on clinical pregnancy losses.
However, LDA was associated with a slight increase in
the overall risk of pregnancy loss among the mid-hsCRP
group before excluding hsCRP $10 mg/L. When only
women with hsCRP ,10 mg/L were considered, all as-
sociations between LDA treatment and pregnancy loss
were null (Supplemental Table 1).
Last, similar to the pregnancy and live birth findings,
longitudinal hsCRP concentrations across pregnancy (8,
20, and 36 weeks’ gestation) were lower among women
assigned to LDA compared with placebo in the highest
baseline hsCRP tertile (P = 0.04), but no treatment dif-
ferences were observed in the middle and lower hsCRP
tertiles (Fig. 3).
Discussion
These findings elucidate two concepts: (1) systemic, chronic,
low-grade inflammation may harm women’s ability to
become pregnant and their inflammation changes through
pregnancy, and (2) this detriment may be restored to
expected levels using preconception-initiated LDA ther-
apy. Specifically, among women with relatively elevated
baseline hsCRP having a history of pregnancy loss, LDA
restored clinically confirmed pregnancy and live birth
rates and lowered hsCRP throughout pregnancy. More-
over, LDA did not reduce pregnancy loss but increased
pregnancy rates by 31% among women entering the
study with hsCRP concentrations among the top one-
third of the study population. Such an effect was most
predominant among lean women with higher hsCRP

 (women with normal BMI or below median waist-to-
hip ratio), in whom the live birth rate increased by 60%
with LDA treatment. Furthermore, preconception-
initiated LDA therapy lowered hsCRP concentrations
throughout pregnancy, with ;20% lower hsCRP con-
centrations at 36 weeks’ gestation, in women with high
hsCRP at baseline.
Inflammation in reproduction has been studied pri-
marily in the context of pregnancy and its complications,
assisted reproductive technologies, and gynecologic pa-
thology (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome). The current
findings among healthy women with mildly elevated
hsCRP, however, are consistent with randomized trials of
trace mineral treatment interventions in women with
polycystic ovary syndrome reporting increased preg-
nancy rates concomitant with lowering hsCRP (27, 28).
Notably, women in the current study were excluded if
polycystic ovary syndrome (or other such conditions)
were self-reported to be previously diagnosed by a
physician, although the presence of undiagnosed or un-
reported disease cannot be ruled out. Also, the differential
impact of inflammatory status on reproductive success
observed here may help explain prior findings of baseline
hsCRP being unrelated to pregnancy rates following
assisted reproductive technologies in a study of UK
women selected to be nonobese having relatively lower
hsCRP overall (29), compared with a report of higher
baseline hsCRP being implicated in lower pregnancy
success in another assisted reproductive technologies
population with overall wider range of hsCRP in study
subjects (30). Certainly, inflammation impeding re-
productive processes is plausible given the delicately
controlled inflammatory mechanisms involving in-
terleukins, tumor necrosis factor–a, and other in-
flammatory mediators that are necessary in the complex
stages leading to ovulation (31) and in endometrial re-
ceptivity and embryo implantation (32). Indeed, previous
data describing the sex ratio of offspring in the EAGeR
trial suggested that higher inflammation discordantly
affected viability of male compared with female con-
ceptions (33). Clearly, mild inflammation may have more
substantial population-level effects on reproduction than
previously thought.
Because cyclooxygenase-2 function, which is directly
inhibited by aspirin, is interrelated with many in-
flammatory mediators involved in reproductive pro-
cesses, aspirin may inhibit downstream effects of
chronically upregulated inflammatory pathways (34, 35).
In addition, it is plausible that processes of repair,
scarring, and embryo receptivity in women with a history
of pregnancy loss, which affects 20% to 30% of all
conceptions (36, 37), may be linked to systemic, chronic
inflammation that is improved with LDA. Importantly,
when we excluded hsCRP values $10 mg/L, a level that
prompts retesting in clinical cardiovascular risk assess-
ment and is consistent with acute phase inflammatory
events (e.g., infection) (20, 21), the effect of LDA in-
creased considerably. Of note, a previous study reported
that 80% of observed hsCRP concentrations $10 mg/L
were associated with a self-report of a cold or flu episode
in the preceding 90 days (20), explaining why such values
are considered uninformative in characterizing chronic
low-grade inflammation.
In addition to its effects on attaining pregnancy, LDA
suppressed hsCRP elevation among women in the highest
hsCRP tertile during pregnancy, a time when in-
flammation is known to increase (38, 39), but with no
effect on hsCRP changes in women with a lower pre-
conception hsCRP level. This finding is consistent with
prior reports indicating that aspirin treatment lowered
hsCRP concentrations in patients with inflammatory
burden (e.g., cardiovascular disease, metabolic syn-
drome) (40, 41) but did not affect inflammation or health
outcomes among participants who were healthy or
without inflammation-related pathology (42, 43). Pre-
pregnancy hsCRP and impacts on the subsequent hsCRP
trajectory in pregnancy could have important clinical
and population heath implications given the breadth of

Aspirin and Pregnancy Incidence in Women With Inflammation

 evidence indicating a link between preconception and
late-pregnancy hsCRP, in addition to the link between
hsCRP measured in pregnancy predicting risk of im-
portant and prevalent pregnancy complications, in-
cluding gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and low
birthweight (14–16). Larger studies are now required to
determine whether screening hsCRP and using risk-based
LDA therapy prior to conception would reduce the
prevalence of such complications, an effect that would
have tremendous public health impacts.
Like pregnancy, obesity is a state of increased in-
flammatory burden, and as expected, we observed in-
creasing mean BMI across the tertiles of hsCRP
concentrations. However, although average differences
in BMI across hsCRP tertiles reflect this relationship,
14% to 21% of women in the lowest hsCRP tertile were
overweight or obese, and conversely, 15% to 26% of
women in the highest hsCRP tertile were not overweight
or obese. Thus, BMI or central adiposity status was not
necessarily consistent with hsCRP status. Furthermore, a
statistically significant effect of LDA was identified
among normal weight, but a lesser, nonsignificant effect
was observed in overweight/obese women with higher
hsCRP, indicating that LDA may affect pathways of
inflammation independent of those linked to adiposity.
Alternatively, a higher aspirin dose may be required to
elicit positive effects in women with larger body mass.
Regarding risks of using LDA for improvement of
reproductive outcomes, comparison with its utilization in
cardiovascular health is useful. For example, in parallel to
the current study, middle-aged men in the highest quartile
of hsCRP experienced a 56% reduction in myocardial
infarction events with aspirin treatment, with attenuated
effects in patients with lower hsCRP (13). However, 118
men must be treated with LDA to prevent one myocardial
infarction event over 5 years (7), whereas the current
study indicates hsCRP screening could reduce the number
needed to treat with LDA to only seven women for every
one live birth gained in 6 months of attempting preg-
nancy if such practice were to be adopted in the future.

 Moreover, use of LDA in reproductive-age women for
purposes of achieving pregnancy and live birth would
represent a time-limited treatment period compared
with indefinite use for cardiovascular event protection in
older adults. As such, hsCRP screening to inform tar-
geted therapy to reduce unnecessary burden and/or risk
may be considered in future evaluation of using LDA in
healthy women. Among EAGeR participants, LDA
therapy was well tolerated (44). Also, given the notably
lower rate of pregnancy loss in the mid-hsCRP placebo
group, rather than higher/increased losses in the LDA
group, we believe our finding of increased pregnancy
loss in this group, when women with .10 mg/L were
included, was a chance finding. Currently, LDA is
recommended after 12 weeks’ gestation for reducing
risk of preeclampsia in high-risk pregnant women (8).
The size of this study, which allowed for stratification
by hsCRP level, and the block-randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled design with prospective monitoring of
conception and clinical pregnancy confirmation were
notable strengths. One drawback was the trial limiting
observation to six cycles of attempted conception; thus,
our results cannot be extrapolated to women (or couples)
with conception delay and infertility. Furthermore, our
population only included women with a history of preg-
nancy loss; however, up to 20% to 30% of all conceptions
end in loss (36, 37), making this population relevant to a
large proportion of women trying to conceive. Further-
more, pregnancy loss may lead to greater anxiety about
becoming pregnant again; thus, interventions to help
women in this situation may be of particular value. In
addition, the study population was predominantly (95%)
white, educated, and economically advantaged, limiting
the generalizability of these findings. Lastly, although
women were advised not to use aspirin while participating
in this study, as with any study of a low-cost, widely
available intervention, some women may have used aspirin
over-the-counter. However, given the double-blind, ran-
domized nature of the study, we would expect that aspirin
was not differentially used between treatment groups;
thus, our findings are unlikely to be affected by bias
stemming from over-the-counter availability of aspirin.
In summary, LDA increased the chances of clinically
recognized pregnancy and live birth in women with
moderately elevated hsCRP and prior pregnancy loss.
hsCRP is attractive as a screening test because it is an
established biomarker, for which standardized, relatively
inexpensive clinical assays are readily available. In addi-
tion to replicating the present findings, next steps should
include further data collection to examine inflammation as
related both to fertility and pregnancy outcomes. These
collective findings should inform further discussion of any
expanded use of aspirin in reproductive medicine, as well
as the potential use of hsCRP as an informative screening
test to guide its clinical application once appropriate
clinical cut-points in this setting are also determined.
