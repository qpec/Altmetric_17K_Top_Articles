Abstract
Introduction and Aims. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of several types of cancer, including several common can-
cers. As part of their corporate social responsibility activities, the alcohol industry (AI) disseminates information about alcohol
and cancer. We examined the information on this which the AI disseminates to the public through its ‘social aspects and public
relations organizations’ and related bodies. The aim of the study was to determine its comprehensiveness and accuracy.
Design and Methods. Qualitative analysis of websites and documents from 27 AI organisations. All text relating to cancer
was extracted and analysed thematically. Results. Most of the organisations were found to disseminate misrepresentations of
the evidence about the association between alcohol and cancer. Three main industry strategies were identified: (i) denial/omis-
sion: denying, omitting or disputing the evidence that alcohol consumption increases cancer risk; (ii) distortion: mentioning
cancer, but misrepresenting the risk; and (iii) distraction: focussing discussion away from the independent effects of alcohol on
common cancers. Breast cancer and colorectal cancer appeared to be a particular focus for this misrepresentation. Discussion
and Conclusions. The AI appears to be engaged in the extensive misrepresentation of evidence about the alcohol-related risk
of cancer. These activities have parallels with those of the tobacco industry. This finding is important because the industry is
involved in developing alcohol policy in many countries, and in disseminating health information to the public, including
schoolchildren. Policymakers, academics, public health and other practitioners should reconsider the appropriateness of their
relationships to these AI bodies. [Petticrew M, Maani Hessari N, Knai C, Weiderpass E. How alcohol industry organi-

Introduction
Alcohol consumption is a well-established risk factor for
a range of cancers, accounting for approximately 4% of
new cancer cases annually [1,2]. The evidence of an
association has been clear since the 1988 review by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),
which reported an increased risk of oral cavity, pharynx,
larynx, oesophagus and liver cancers [3]. In 2007, as
more evidence became available, IARC added breast
cancer and colorectal cancer to the list [4]. Since then
the evidence has strengthened further, with at least
100 studies on alcohol and breast cancer alone [5], and
the most comprehensive review of the evidence to date
shows that the risk of breast cancer is increased even at
low levels of consumption [6]. Both the most recent
IARC review in 2012 [7] and the UK’s Committee on
Carcinogenicity review in 2016 [8] confirmed the
increased risks of cancers of the mouth and throat, lar-
ynx, oesophagus, upper aerodigestive tract, breast, liver,

 colon and rectum and pancreas (see Table S1, Support-
ing information). There is little evidence of an association
with ovarian and prostate cancer, though a recent meta-
analysis has reported an increased risk of prostate cancer
[9]. The evidence on other cancers remains unclear [7].
The Committee on Carcinogenicity concluded that the
evidence that alcohol consumption reduces the risk of
some cancers (including renal cell cancers, and cancers
of the kidney, ovary, thyroid and lung) remains limited
and inconsistent, and that the increased risk of other can-
cers as a result of drinking alcohol far outweighs any pos-
sible decreased risk [8]. The weight of scientific evidence
is therefore clear that drinking increases the risk of some
of the most common cancers [10].
The relationship between alcohol consumption and
cancer has been disputed by the alcohol industry
(AI) and its affiliated organisations [11]. At the same
time many AI-funded organisations, most commonly
‘social
aspects
and
public
relations
organizations’
(SAPROs), disseminate health information with the
stated intention of informing consumers and encourag-
ing ‘responsible drinking’ [12]. Such organisations are
portrayed as delivering on the AI’s corporate social
responsibility (CSR) goals, but it has been argued that
these organisations’ activities are in fact aimed at main-
taining profits by promoting ineffective interventions,
misrepresenting the evidence, and attempting to influ-
ence public perceptions in ways that favour industry
interests [12].
This study analysed the information on cancer
which is disseminated by AI SAPROs and similar orga-
nisations. We aimed to determine the extent to which
they fully and accurately communicate the scientific
evidence on alcohol and cancer to consumers.
Methods
We searched for information on cancer and alcohol
consumption disseminated by 27 AI bodies and related
organisations (see Table 1 and Table S2). These were
identified during September–December 2016 from the
Global Alcohol Producers website and its progress
reports, and from the CSR sections of alcohol produ-
cers’ websites [13,14]. We included organisations from
English speaking countries or where the information
was available in English. One website was inaccessible,
leaving 26 for analysis.
Two authors independently extracted information
from documents, webpages or reports. These data were
coded iteratively by two authors in Excel (Redmond,
Washington: Microsoft, 2016) and in nVivo 11.3.2
(QSR International UK Ltd, Daresbury, Cheshire UK),
and were analysed using documentary analysis methods
[15,16]. The approach comprised reading and under-
standing meanings of individual texts to identify sub-
themes; identification of thematic clusters of nodes; tri-
angulation
between
documents
and
organisations;
checking reliability/validity, and the use of representative
examples [17–19]. Disagreements about coding or rele-
vance were referred to a third author. This resulted in
15 codes which were grouped for analysis into three
main industry strategies (see Box 1). The quotes were
coded independently by two authors, and agreement
calculated using the κ statistic (κ = 0.4). All the data
were extracted by one author, and a second author then
Box 1: How the alcohol industry organisations
under
review
misrepresent
the
evidence
on
alcohol and cancer
1. Denial/omission: denying, or disputing any
link with cancer, or selective omission of the
relationship
The approach includes:
• Denying that any relationship exists, or claiming
inaccurately that there is no risk for light or
‘moderate’ drinking.
• Selective omission: avoiding mention of cancer
in general, or of specific cancers.
2. Distortion: mentioning some risk of cancer,
but misrepresenting or obfuscating the nature
or size of that risk
This is done by:
• Claiming or implying that the risk applies only
to particular patterns of drinking (heavy drinking
or binge drinking).
• Claiming or implying that, as knowledge of the
mechanism is incomplete, the evidence of a
causal relationship is not trustworthy, and/or
claiming a lack of expert consensus.
• Claiming protective effects of alcohol on some
cancers, thus confusing the picture of overall risk.
3. Distraction: focussing discussion away from
the independent effects of alcohol on common
cancers
This is done by:
• Minimising the role of alcohol by pointing to a
wide range of other risk factors for cancer.
• Emphasising less common cancers, and emphasis-
ing cancer ‘types’ rather than cancer prevalence.
In addition, there appears to be a particular
focus on misrepresenting the risks of breast and
colorectal cancer.

 went back to the same sources to check all data, before
the final coding took place.
The detailed information on cancer presented by
these organisations is included as Table S2 (online).
Representative examples are given below to highlight
the common approaches used by these organisations.
Additional examples appear in Table S3.

Results
Most organisational websites (24/26) contain significant
omissions and/or misrepresentations of the evidence.
They appear to use three main strategies (Box 1).
Denying, disputing or selectively omitting the
relationship between alcohol consumption and
cancer
Denying that any relationship exists or claiming inaccu-
rately
that
there
is
no
risk
for
light
or
‘moderate’
drinking.
As noted in Table S1, alcohol consumption
is associated with at least seven types of cancer [20].
Five AI organisations deny an association between
alcohol and at least one type of cancer with statements
which
are
contradicted
by
the
existing
evidence
(Table 1). A frequent approach is to present mislead-
ing information about the risk associated with ‘light’ or
‘moderate’ drinking, as in these examples:
‘Recent research suggests that light to moderate drinking is
not significantly associated with an increased risk for total
cancer in either men or women.’ International Alliance
for Responsible Drinking [21].
‘Some studies show a link between alcohol and breast can-
cer among both pre-menopausal and post-menopausal
women. However, no causal relationship has been shown
between moderate drinking and breast cancer.’ Éduc’al-
cool (Quebec) [22].
The first statement from the International Alliance
for Responsible Drinking (IARD, an alcohol producers
‘responsible drinking’ body) misrepresents the well-
evidenced association between alcohol consumption
and a range of specific, common cancers. The second
statement from Éduc’alcool about ‘no causal relation-
ship’ is factually incorrect.
An informational video about cancer on the SAB Miller
website ‘TalkingAlcohol.com’ similarly states inaccurately
that there is no link between alcohol and most cancers
except for ‘mainly cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract’
and the liver [23] (other examples: see Table S3).
Selective omission: avoiding mention of cancer, and/or of
specific cancers.
Most of the websites or documents
(13/21 from SAPROs and 5/5 from producers) either do
not mention cancer (while discussing other health risks)
or appear to selectively omit specific cancers (Table 1).
For example, Pernod’s ‘Wise Drinking’ brochure dis-
cusses the need to ‘combat unhealthy drinking habits’,
and lists ‘mental retardation in children’ as among the
most common consequences of alcohol consumption,
but presents no information on cancer [24]. Diageo’s
DrinkIQ.com website has a section entitled ‘Alcohol’s
short-term and long-term effects on your body’, listing
alcohol dependence, pancreatic problems, liver cirrho-
sis, brain damage, death and ‘physical and emotional
health problems’ [25]. It does not mention cancer. Edu-
c’alcool (Quebec) has a webpage labelled ‘The effects of
moderate, regular alcohol consumption’, which men-
tions cardiovascular and peripheral disease, stroke, gall-
stones,
diabetes,
psychosocial
effects
and
‘other
beneficial effects’, but does not mention cancer [22].
Distortion: mentioning some risk of cancer, but
obscuring, misrepresenting or obfuscating the
nature or size of that risk
The second and most common approach involves pre-
senting the relationship between alcohol and cancer as
highly complex (for example, in terms of subgroup
effects and patterns of drinking), with the implication,
or statement, that there is no evidence of a consistent,
or independent link. Within this, three approaches
were identified (see also Table S3):
Claiming or implying that risk only applies to particular
patterns of drinking.
It is commonly stated by these
organisations (12/20 SAPROs) that the risk of some
common cancers only exists for ‘heavy’, ‘excessive’ or
‘binge’ drinking. For example,
‘Cancer risk associated with the consumption of alcohol is
related to patterns of drinking, particularly heavy drinking
over extended periods of time.’ Australia, Drinkwise [26].
Similar statements also appear on the IARD website,
such as ‘In general, alcohol-associated cancers have
been linked with heavy drinking’ [27].
The scientific evidence suggests that such statements
are misleading (Table S1), because the increased risk
of some common cancers, such as breast, oesophageal,
laryngeal, mouth and throat cancers and cancers of the
upper aerodigestive tract, starts at low levels of con-
sumption, even though it is low at those low levels
[7,8] (see also Table S3).
Alcohol industry information and cancer risk
297

 Claiming or implying that, as knowledge of the mechanism
is incomplete, the evidence of a causal relationship is
not
trustworthy,
and/or
claiming
a
lack
of
expert
consensus.
Other industry claims (from three organisa-
tions) relate to disputation of the mechanisms, or
involve claims about the consistency of the evidence,
as in these examples:
‘Recent studies indicate a dose-response relationship between
alcohol consumption and breast cancer, although this rela-
tionship was not evident in some past studies.’ IARD [27].
‘All the studies show that the knowledge about the causes of
breast cancer is still very incomplete and as scientists from
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in
the USA recently pointed out, some other (possible con-
founding) factors have not been considered in the research
relating the consumption of alcoholic beverages to breast
cancer.’ Wine Information Council [28].
This is also a feature of SABMiller materials:
‘The mechanism by which alcohol consumption may cause
breast cancer is not fully known…. The relationship… is
undergoing vigorous research… If and how these two factors
may interact and affect risk is not completely known.’
(Table S2).
Claiming protective effects of alcohol on some cancers, thus
confusing the picture of overall risk.
The evidence that
alcohol reduces the risk of some cancers is very lim-
ited. The Committee on Carcinogenicity review of
2016 stated in relation to protective effects:
‘We think that it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from a
small number of studies that indicate that kidney cancer, non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and extra-hepatic
bile system cancer are less common in people who drink alcohol
than in non-drinkers. However, it is clear that the increased
risk of other cancers as a result of drinking alcohol far out-
weighs any possible decreased risk of these cancers.’ [8].
In relation to non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin
lymphoma, the Committee on Carcinogenicity also
stated in their review of the evidence that they ‘….have
concerns about the consistency of the classification of
cancers of this type and the confounding effect of
diverse lymphoma types. In addition, there is no
immediately obvious mode of action that could explain
the association’ [8].
Despite the lack of evidence for protective effects of
alcohol consumption on cancer, a wide range of pro-
tective effects are claimed in industry websites. For
example ARA, a South African SAPRO [29], and the
industry body IARD [27], state that there is a protec-
tive effect for renal-cell cancer and non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma. IARD also appears to claim a protective effect
against multiple myeloma, while at the same time
acknowledging that the findings from individual stud-
ies
are
inconsistent
[27].
The
IARD
conclusion
regarding an inverse risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is
consistent with the IARC report in 2012 [7]. The
IARD conclusion regarding multiple myeloma is not
in agreement with that of IARC, who reported no con-
sistent association with multiple myeloma in most
studies [7].
The Wine Information Council claims that:
‘Moderate wine intake may actually reduce the risk of
oesophagus, thyroid, lung, kidney and colorectal cancers as
well as Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. …Concerning breast
cancer, there may also be a protective role for wine.’ Wine
Information Council [30].
Claims about the protective effects are also made on
the SABMiller website, which states that moderate
alcohol consumption can be linked to lower risk of
bladder, kidney, ovarian and prostate cancer [31].
IARD also appears to recommend drinking as protec-
tive in smokers:
‘Among long-term smokers consumption of alcohol has been
shown to be protective against colorectal adenomas.’ [27].
The Portman Group’s response to the consultation
on the revised UK guidelines (issued in 2016) includes
a section in which the evidence is disputed, referring
to protective effects. It refers to the ‘increased risk of a
small number of cancer types’ and states: ‘Different
levels of alcohol consumption have a range of effects
on cancer risk including no impact on the majority of
cancers, and in some cases, an inverse relationship.’
[11]. As well as misrepresenting the evidence, this
statement is misleading as it confuses the number of
different ‘types’ of cancer, with the risk of specific can-
cers. This is discussed further below.
Distraction: focussing discussion away from the
independent effects of alcohol in increasing the
risk of common cancers
Minimising the role of alcohol by pointing to a wide range
of other risk factors.
A common strategy appears to
involve discussing a wide range of real and potential
risk factors, thus presenting alcohol as just one risk
among many. Eight of the SAPROs appear to do this.
A wide range of risk factors, including irrelevant and
non-modifiable ones, are referred to, for example:
298
M. Petticrew et al.
© 2017 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs
 ‘Not all heavy drinkers get cancer, as multiple risk factors
are involved in the development of cancers including genet-
ics and family history of cancer, age, environmental factors,
and behavioural variables, as well as social determinants of
health.’ Australia: Drinkwise [26].
‘Alcohol has been identified as a known human carcinogen
by IARC, along with over 1,000 others, including solvents
and chemical compounds, certain drugs, viral infection,
solar radiation from exposure to sunlight, and processed
meat.’ IARD [27].
‘For example, the fact that you are female is a risk factor in
developing breast cancer. We also know breast cancer is
age-related so you’re more likely to develop it as you get
older and that you’re more prone to breast cancer if it is
part of your family history. These are all factors beyond our
control. We also know that risk is related to the ‘hormone
environment’ that women experience during the course of
early pregnancy, child birth and breastfeeding which all
exert a protective effect.’ Drinkaware, UK [32].
In other cases, wider socioeconomic factors are also
stated as possible causes by IARD [27], SABMiller
[31] and the Portman Group [11].
Such messages are misleading and potentially confus-
ing. Misleading, because they emphasise potential mod-
erating
factors
without
acknowledging
the
clear
independent risk of alcohol consumption; the informa-
tion therefore may suggest to readers that only people
with these co-factors are at risk. Confusing, because it is
unclear how the consumer is meant to interpret them or
what action she is meant to take (e.g. messages about
increasing risk with age at beginning of menarche or
about wider socioeconomic factors).
Discussion of smoking may also be used in this way
to distract from the independent effects of alcohol.
The scientific evidence shows that the risk is indeed
higher among smokers [7,8], and there is a strong
interaction between alcohol and smoking for cancers
of the upper aerodigestive tract [8]. The risk of cancer
is also independent of smoking [10,33,34]. As for spe-
cific cancers, for breast cancer the risk does not appear
to be confounded by smoking [7], and the association
is unclear for colorectal and pancreatic cancer [8]. AI
bodies in some cases appear to imply that it is mainly
smokers who should be concerned. For example, the
Portman Group’s response to the consultation on the
new UK alcohol guidelines places considerable weight
on smoking, recommending that it should be empha-
sised (see Table S2) [11]. An emphasis on smoking
appears in other AI materials [27] (Table S2).
Emphasising
less
common
cancers,
and
emphasising
cancer ‘types’ rather than cancer prevalence.
In a few
cases alcohol organisations places an emphasis on less
common cancers. The SABMiller website‘TalkingAlco
hol.com’ appears to imply that alcohol is only associ-
ated with less common forms of breast cancer:
‘Recent studies indicate that alcohol consumption may be
more strongly linked to a certain less common form of breast
cancer (lobular cancer), than it is to the most common type
of breast cancer (ductal cancer).’ [31].
The evidence regarding lobular and ductal cancers
is itself unclear. The Women’s Health Initiative Obser-
vational study found that, compared with never-drin-
kers, women consuming 7+ alcoholic drinks per week
had a slightly increased risk of hormone-receptor posi-
tive lobular cancer, than ductal cancer [35]. However
the authors also concluded that alcohol was signifi-
cantly positively associated with total breast cancer,
with even a moderate amount of alcohol (>10 g day−1)
significantly increasing breast cancer risk. Other stud-
ies have not found that alcohol risk is clearly differen-
tiated by subtype [3]. It is possible that the risk may be
slightly greater for lobular than ductal tumours, though
the direct relevance of this information for SABMiller’s
consumers is unclear.
The Portman Group document also appears to
imply that the risk only applies to less common can-
cers, by conflating cancer type with cancer prevalence.
It asserts that ‘the vast majority of cancer types are not
associated with alcohol consumption’, and criticises
the revised UK guidelines on the grounds that they
‘amplify the small number of cancer types where
increased risk is linked to alcohol consumption’ [11].
The small number of cancer ‘types’ distracts from the
fact that these include two of the most common can-
cers (breast and colorectal cancer) [1,2].
Misrepresentation of the risks of breast and
colorectal cancer
There appears to be two particularly frequent areas of
misinformation on these sites: breast cancer and colo-
rectal cancer. In all, 20 of the organisations present
no, or misleading information on breast cancer, and
21 present no information, or misleading information
on colorectal cancer (Table 1). Some websites single
out these cancers (but not others) to dispute or deny
the increase in risk. This can be seen on the websites
of Éduc’alcool (Quebec) [22] and on the Drinkwise
(Australia) website [26]. One such example is Éduc’al-
cool’s statement (above) that ‘no causal relationship
has been shown between moderate drinking and breast
cancer’
[36].
The
Wine
in
Moderation
website
includes a lengthy section on confounding in relation

 to the risk of breast cancer, concluding that ‘based on
scientific evidence, in post-menopausal women, the
increase in the risk of breast cancer, if there is any at
all, is small’ [37] (our emphasis). The SAB Miller
website also has a significant focus on proposing alter-
native risk factors for breast cancer, other than alcohol
(see
interview
in
Table
S2)
[37].
The
Portman
Group’s response to the UK guidelines includes a
section on breast cancer, in which the evidence is dis-
puted. For example, it states that ‘studies associating
moderate alcohol consumption are contradictory’. The
IARD ‘Drinking and NCDs’ brochure wrongly links
breast cancer only to heavy drinking [38]. [Correction
added on 7 November 2017, after first online publica-
tion: The second sentence in the above paragraph has
been corrected to change the numbers of organisations
to 20 and 21 respectively.’]
In the case of Drinkwise (Australia), an interactive
tool
(see:
https://drinkwise.org.au/alcohol-and-your-
health/#app) includes clickable links to the immune
system, heart, liver, skin, brain, liver, stomach, pan-
creas, bowel kidneys and reproductive system, but not
the breast. Clicking on the ‘Liver’ and ‘Bowel’ links
takes the user to other pages about cancers, but there
is no similar link to information on breast cancer.
Most of the websites/documents do not mention
colorectal cancer, even when in some cases (e.g. Hei-
neken, Drinkwise) they specifically mention other can-
cers. In one other case (Wine in Moderation) it is
stated inaccurately that alcohol reduces the risk of
colorectal cancer [30]. On the Australian Drinkwise
website, colorectal cancer is mentioned in the list of
cancers caused by alcohol, but not in the ‘Alcohol and
your bowel’ section, which discusses ‘bacterial over-
growth in your small intestine which may cause bloat-
ing, gas, abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhoea,
and irritable bowel syndrome’ [29]. The information
on colorectal cancer presented on two other websites

Six SAPRO websites substantiate their
statements on cancer and alcohol by providing a list of
references cited in the text, or a bibliography. Of the
SAPROS which include references, IARD is most
likely to cite peer-reviewed alcohol-cancer-related pub-
lications (48), followed by ARA (16), and Drinkaware
UK (12). However, this does not mean that the cita-
tions used are the most relevant. For example, inde-
pendent
IARC
reports
are
rarely
cited,
and
in
disputing the evidence on increased breast cancer risk,
the Portman Group document does not reference the
IARC
reviews,
other
systematic
reviews,
nor
the
Committee on Carcinogenicity review. The only cited
academic
review
paper
disputes
the
relationship
between breast cancer and alcohol consumption, using
many of the arguments discussed above [39]. The lead
author of the paper is head of Scientific Affairs of the
U.S. Distilled Spirits Council.
Discussion
Principal findings
Public awareness of the risk of cancer from alcohol con-
sumption is low [40], and it has been argued that
greater public awareness, particularly of the risk of
breast cancer, poses a significant threat to the AI [20].
Our analysis suggests that the major global alcohol pro-
ducers may attempt to mitigate this risk by disseminat-
ing misleading information about cancer through their
‘responsible drinking’ bodies. The existing evidence of
strategies employed by the AI suggests that this may not
be a matter of simple error [41,42]. It is already known
that the AI misrepresents scientific evidence, for exam-
ple in relation to Minimum Unit Pricing of alcohol
[43], where it has been demonstrated that the industry
employs ‘denialism’ in public discussions [43]. Our
analysis suggests that AI denialism may extend to the
relationship between alcohol and cancer.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study, and in relation to
other studies
The main strength of the study is its breadth: it ana-
lyses all information about cancer provided by the
major international CSR bodies which are used by the
AI to disseminate information to the public. This
strengthens the conclusion that the findings are both
robust and generalisable. The main weakness is that
there are many other mechanisms and organisations
through which industry disseminates health-related
information
(e.g.
through
Twitter
accounts,
at
meetings and via advertising campaigns) which we did
not examine. It seems implausible however that indus-
try would adopt different messaging regarding cancer
through other outlets, though this is an important issue
for further research. It is also possible that these indus-
try sources misquote or present out of context, expert
opinions or other commentary which they include.
There are no closely similar studies to this, though
our findings have similarities with other AI strategies,
particularly the focus on individual causal factors, and
personal variability in risk, even where these are not rele-
vant [42]. The systematic review by Savell et al. (2015),
for example, found that manipulation of evidence was a
key alcohol strategy for influencing marketing regula-
tions. This included selective citation of industry-

 favourable evidence, omission of evidence, removal of
industry-troubling phrases and contesting the nature of
the evidence, all of which we found here [42].
The most obvious parallel is with the global tobacco
industry’s decades-long campaign to mislead the public
about the risk of cancer, which also used front organisa-
tions and CSR activities to mislead the public [44,45].
The tobacco industry also developed arguments which
emphasise the complex aetiology of lung cancer and
CHD, in order to help deny the epidemiological evidence;
for example, it engaged in an ever-wider search for any fac-
tor, however unlikely (such as keeping pet birds, or inade-
quate consumption of green tea) that might serve as an
independent risk factor for smoking-related diseases [46].
The extensive AI discussions of potential confounders in
the alcohol–cancer relationship may be seen in the same
light. The analysis by Ulucanlar et al. (2014) of tobacco
industry submissions to the public consultation on plain
packaging found similar extensive misrepresentation of evi-
dence, including distortion of the findings of scientific
studies [47].
One important finding is that AI materials appear to
specifically omit or misrepresent the evidence on breast
and colorectal cancer. One possible reason is that these
are among the most common cancers, and therefore may
be more well-known or salient than oral and oesophageal
cancers
(which
we
found
to
be
more
commonly
acknowledged by industry SAPROs (Table 1)). The pro-
vision of misleading information about breast cancer may
also reflect existing industry strategies aimed at develop-
ing the female alcohol market [20]. Note also that these
data were collected in 2016. Some website content may
therefore have changed since the data were collected.
Implications for clinicians and policymakers
Overall,
through
its
provision
of
misleading
information, the AI can maintain ‘the illusion of right-
eousness’ in the eyes of policymakers [48], while
negating any significant impact on consumption and
profits. These findings therefore have significant impli-
cations. They provide evidence that the AI, like the
tobacco industry, misleads the public and policy-
makers about the cancer risks of their products. Our
findings are also a reminder of the risk which accom-
panies giving to the AI the responsibility of informing
the public about alcohol and health [49].
The findings also suggest that major international
alcohol companies may be misleading their share-
holders about the risks of their products. This may
leave the industry open to litigation in some countries,
as has happened with the tobacco and, more recently,
other industries. For example, Coca-Cola and the
American Beverage Association are currently being
sued for downplaying the risks of their products [50].
Finally, some public health bodies, academics and
practitioners liaise with the industry bodies included in
this study, for example by acting as advisors or trus-
tees, or by collaborating with them in implementation
activities. Despite their undoubtedly good intentions,
we suggest that it is unethical for them to lend their
expertise and legitimacy to industry campaigns which
mislead the public about alcohol-related harms.
Areas for further research
Further analysis of citation bias is needed, as cherry-
picking of evidence sources appears common (e.g.
single studies, and magazine and newspaper articles
frequently appear to be cited in preference to up-to-date
systematic reviews). The analysis of information produced
by new AI bodies which disseminate information about
alcohol and health—such as the newly established Alco-
hol Information Partnership [51]—should also be care-
fully monitored. There is also an urgent need to examine
other industry websites, documents, social media and
other materials in order to assess the nature and extent of
the distortion of evidence, and whether it extends to other
health information—for example, in relation to cardiovas-
cular disease. Comparative research across industries and
with other areas of alcohol policy to examine industry dis-
tortion of evidence is also needed.
Conclusion
It has often been assumed that, by and large, the AI,
unlike the tobacco industry, has tended not to deny the
harms of alcohol [52]. Our analysis shows that, on the
contrary, the global AI is currently actively disseminating
misinformation about alcohol and cancer risk, particu-
larly breast cancer [48]. The AI, unlike the tobacco
industry, still has significant access in many countries to
government health departments [52,53]. It is also active
in the international policy arena, with, for example, part-
ner or stakeholder status at World Health Organization
and United Nations meetings relevant to alcohol, on
occasions when the tobacco industry is excluded [52].
This study shows that the AI uses similar tactics to the
tobacco industry, to the same ends: to protect its profits,
to the detriment of public health. The full scale and
nature of these activities requires urgent investigation.
