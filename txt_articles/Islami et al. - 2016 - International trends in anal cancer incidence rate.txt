Abstract
Background: Previous studies have reported rapid increases in anal cancer incidence
rates in seven high-income countries in North America, Europe and Oceania. There is
very limited information on whether this pattern is replicated in other parts of the world.
In this study, we examine recent trends in anal cancer incidence in 18 countries
worldwide.
Methods: We calculated age-standardized incidence rates for anal squamous cell carcin-
oma (ASCC) and anal adenocarcinoma (AAC) for a minimum of 13 years through to
2007, using data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer’s Cancer
Incidence in Five Continents series, and applied joinpoint regression models to assess
changes in incidence rates. We also conducted an extended analysis of the data from the
USA through to 2012.
Results: ASCC was the main histological subtype in most of the countries considered in
this analysis. The incidence of ASCC increased in both men and women in several high-
income countries, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, the
UK and the USA, whereas it increased only in women in Colombia, Estonia, the Russian
Federation, Slovakia and Switzerland. Conversely, there was little change in the inci-
dence of ASCC in either men or women in India, Israel, Japan, Singapore and Spain. The
incidence rates of AAC decreased or were stable in most populations.
Conclusions: The ASCC incidence rates increased in both men and women or in women
in all countries included in this study, except Asian countries and Spain, where the rates
remained unchanged. Population-based preventive measures, including human papillo-
mavirus vaccination and advocacy for safe sexual behaviours, may contribute to curbing
the surging burden of the disease.

 Introduction
Anal cancer is often neglected because it is a relatively rare
cancer. It has been estimated that approximately 14 500
cases of anal cancer in women and 12 500 in men occurred
in 2008 worldwide.1,2 Previous studies have reported a
relatively rapid increase in the incidence rate in some very
high-income countries, including Australia,3,4 Canada,5,6
Denmark,7 France,8 The Netherlands,9,10 the UK11–13 and
the USA.14, 15 However, the direction and magnitude of anal
cancer trends elsewhere is largely unknown. Understanding
the epidemiology of a cancer is the first step in recognizing
and reducing the burden of that cancer.
In this paper, we present contemporary variations in the
incidence of anal cancer across 18 countries in four contin-
ents (excluding Africa), including several countries that are
economically less developed than the above-mentioned
countries, using the most up-to-date data. We use a system-
atic approach to address a limitation of previous reports,
that of ensuring comparability of the different datasets. We
report these results by histological subtype, as the descrip-
tive epidemiology and aetiology of anal squamous cell car-
cinoma (ASCC) and anal adenocarcinoma (AAC) are
somewhat heterogeneous due to differences in cellular
origin.16
Methods
In this analysis, anal cancer is defined as malignant neo-
plasm of the anus and anal canal (ICD-10 C21). Using
data from population-based cancer registries, we extracted
the number of new cases of anal cancer by year, sex and
age group and the corresponding population at risk from
the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5), CI5plus
database held at the International Agency for Research on
Cancer.17 Data on anal cancer by histological subtype
were available from 28 countries. To examine temporal
trends in anal cancer incidence worldwide, while ensuring
that the inherent random variation in individual datasets
was sufficiently limited to enable interpretation, we re-
stricted the analysis to countries with at least 200 cases in
men and/or 200 cases in women in the entire period of ob-
servation, and countries in which the proportion of anal
cancers with an unspecified histology (unspecified carcin-
omas or unspecified morphology) was less than 20%.
Finally, 19 populations from 18 countries were included in
this study, as we considered data from US Whites and
Blacks separately. Incidence data were based on national
registries in six countries: Denmark, Estonia, Israel, The
Netherlands, Singapore and Slovakia. In nine countries,
including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Spain,
Switzerland, the UK and the USA, aggregated data from at
least three local cancer registries were available. When the
starting date of cancer registries in a given country was not
the same, we selected a starting date to maximize popula-
tion coverage while ensuring a sufficient span of registra-
tion years. In Colombia, India and the Russian Federation,
incidence data were based on a single local cancer registry.
To calculate age-standardized rates (ASR), we stratified
the cases by the traditional 5-year age groups by sex, and
used the 1960 Segi world standard population.18 ASRs and
associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
for: all anal cancers combined; ASCC; AAC; a combined
group of anal cancers with other specified histologies; and
a combined group of unspecified carcinomas and anal can-
cers with an unspecified morphology. We did not adjust
ASCC and AAC categories for the latter category, as the
proportion of anal cancers with an unspecified histology in
both men and women was < 20% in all and � 5% in half
of the included populations. In the CI5 series, and conse-
quently in this analysis, the following ICD-O-2 (M) codes
were used to identify ASCC (8050–8076, 8123–8124) and
AAC (8140–8145, 8190–8231, 8260–8263, 8310, 8480–
8490, 8560, 8570).19
We report mean incidence rates over a 2-year period
(2006–07) to increase the stability of the results. Trends in
incidence by sex are shown with smoothed lines on fitting
locally weighted regression (LOWESS) curves, in which
Key Messages
• The incidence of anal cancer has been increasing in most populations included in this study.
• In these countries, anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is the most common histological subtype of anal cancer.
• Reasons for the increase in ASCC incidence are unknown but likely include a rise in prevalence of the factors that
may increase the incidence and persistence of anal HPV infection, such as cervical HPV infection in women.
• Factors that mediate the risk are linked to sexual behaviour and HIV infection, but further studies on contributing fac-
tors are needed.
• Certain preventive measures if implemented, including HPV vaccination and campaigns for safer sexual behaviours,
would serve to prevent a substantial number of anal cancer cases in the future.

 30% of the data were used in the smoothing. Using the
same methodology as above, we extended the analysis for
the USA through to 2012, as more up-to-date data strati-
fied by histology were available for the country.20 We per-
formed similar analyses stratified by broad age groups
(20–44, 45–64, � 65 years) for selected populations with
at least 400 anal cancer cases in each sex. Stata software
(Stata Corp LP, version 13) was used for all calculations.
We also show average incidence rates for overlapping
tumours of the rectum and anus (ICD 10 code C21.8) in
1993–97, 1998–2002, and 2003–07, available from three
latest editions of CI5 (editions VIII through to X), for select
registries.
In addition, we applied joinpoint regression models, in
which a series of joined straight lines were fitted to ASR
trends,
using
Joinpoint
Regression
Program,
version
4.1.1.5.21 This analysis was performed only when there
were at least 100 cancer cases in the respective group (by
population, sex and histological subtype) during the study
period. We specified a logarithmic transformation of ASRs
and a maximum number of three joinpoints in order to
avoid capturing unstable trends due to relatively small
numbers of cases. We present the annual percentage
changes (APC) and the corresponding 95% CIs to quantify
the magnitude of changes in anal cancer incidence over
time.
Results
Table 1 shows the registries, time periods, corresponding
population counts and cancer cases in 19 populations from
18 countries included in this analysis, by sex and histolo-
gical subtype. The earliest starting year in this analysis was
for Estonia (1968) and the latest was for the Russian
Federation (1994). The number of anal cancer cases ranged
from 80 in the Russian Federation to 3114 in the UK in
men, and from 195 in Singapore to 4639 in White women
in the USA.
Incidence rates in 2006–07
The ASRs for anal cancer (per 100 000) ranged from 0.2 in
the Russian Federation to 1.6 in Blacks in the USA among
men, and from 0.2 in Spain and Japan to 2.1 in Colombia
among women (Supplementary Table S1, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). The point estimate of
ASR for ASCC was greater in women than in men in all
populations except for US Blacks, Spain, Israel and Japan.
The incidence rates of ASCC in both men and women in
Australia and populations in the Americas and Northern
and Western Europe, except for men in Estonia, were gen-
erally higher than in other studied populations (Figure 1,
Supplementary Table S1). The highest ASR (per 100 000)
for ASCC was found for US Blacks (1.3) and US Whites
(0.8) among men and for Switzerland (1.7), Denmark (1.5)
and US Whites (1.3) among women. The ASR for ASCC in
both men and women was < 0.5 per 100 000 in Asian and
Central/Eastern European populations.
In both men and women, the incidence of AAC was
generally lower than ASCC, except for Japan, Singapore
and Slovakia, where at least half of anal cancers in 2006–
07 were AACs. However, the latter pattern was based on
modest numbers of anal cancer cases. Also, substantial
proportions of anal cancers in Japan and Singapore were
overlapping tumours of the rectum and anus, some of
which could actually be misreported cases of rectal cancer
(Supplementary Table S2, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). Overall, AAC was more common in men
than in women in most populations.
Trends in incidence
Incidence trends by population and sex for all anal cancers
combined are shown in Supplementary Figure S1 and
Supplementary Table S3 (available as Supplementary data
at IJE online), but we focus on trends for ASCC and AAC
because rates and the direction and relative magnitude of
the trends of the two main subtypes varied substantially by
population and sex. Incidence for ASCC in both men and
women
has
been
increasing
in
Australia,
Canada,
Denmark, France, Italy, The Netherlands, the UK and
Blacks and Whites in the USA (Table 2, Figure 2). Uniform
increases were apparent, except for women in Australia
and in US Whites where a steeper increase beginning in the
mid 1990s was observed. In all above-mentioned popula-
tions, incidence for ASCC was higher in women than in
men in all years of observation, except for US Blacks in
whom male incidence surpassed female incidence in 1996
(Figure 2). In Colombia, the Russian Federation, Slovakia
and Switzerland, the increase was confined to women. In
Estonia, incidence for ASCC also appears to be increasing
in women, although a joinpoint analysis for ASCC was not
feasible: in this group, anal cancer incidence has been
increasing, ASCC constitutes two-thirds of all anal cancers
and there has been little change in incidence of other histo-
logical subtypes. Incidence for ASCC was stable over time
in India, Israel, Japan, Singapore and Spain. When we lim-
ited the joinpoint analysis to 1989–2007 to examine the
trends in the same time period, the overall patterns did not
change substantially (Table 3).
Incidence trends for AAC have been decreasing in men
and women in The Netherlands, in men in Australia (fol-
lowing an earlier increase), France and Israel, and in
women in Denmark (Table 2, Figure 3). In contrast, the

 incidence of AAC has been increasing in men and women
in Japan and in women in the UK. In the joinpoint analysis
limited to 1989–2007, however, the increasing trend of
AAC in women in the UK disappeared. An examination of
average incidence rates of overlapping tumours of the rec-
tum and anus in the past three editions of CI5 suggested an
increasing trend for these tumours in Japan, which could
be responsible for the increase in AAC incidence rates in
that country (Supplementary Table S2). In other popula-
tions, there has been little change or too few cases to per-
form a joinpoint analysis. There has been little change in
incidence of anal cancers with a specified histology other
than ASCC or AAC (Supplementary Figure S2, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online) or with an unspecified
histology
(Supplementary
Figure
S3,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
The extended analysis of the data from the USA conveys
a continuation of the increasing trends in ASCC incidence
rates in both men and women (Supplementary Figure S4,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Based on a
small number of cases, the increase halted in Black men in
2010. Similar patterns were observed when the incidence
rates were standardized to the WHO Standard Population
(World Health Organization 2000–25), rather than the
1960 Segi World Standard Population (Supplementary
Figure S5, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
In a supplementary analysis, using the only source of that
information available to us at such level of detail globally,
we examined trend in incidence of rectal cancers (ICD
code C20) that had a morphology code for SCC (ICD-O-3
M of 8050–8085 and 8120–8131) in the USA. The inci-
dence rates for this group of cancers were low (0.2 per
100 000, or less in 2011–12) in each sex/race (Black or
White) stratum, with little change over time (data not
shown), indicating little impact of the SCCs categorized as
rectal cancer on the observed trends of ASCC in the USA.
In stratified analysis by age groups, in all populations
included in this analysis except in Japan, the incidence of
ASCC was the highest in ages 45–64 years with a sharp in-
crease starting in the 1990s, followed by rates for ages �
65
years
(Supplementary
Figure
S6,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online). Among US Blacks, the
incidence at ages 20–44 years has been higher than among
ages � 65 years since the 1990s. Incidence of AAC was
generally higher in older age groups (Supplementary Figure
S7, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Discussion
We found that incidence of anal cancer has been increas-
ing—either in both sexes or in women—in many popula-
tions, especially in the Americas, Northern and Western

 Europe, and Australia. In these populations, ASCC was
substantially more common than other histological sub-
types and was the main contributor to the increase in anal
cancer incidence. The incidence of ASCC is lower in Asia,
Central/Eastern Europe, and Spain, and Spanish and Asian
populations have seen little change. In contrast to ASCC,
incidence for AAC has been stable or decreasing in most
populations.
The reason for the increasing ASCC incidence rates in
many populations is unclear, but is likely to reflect changes
in prevalence of environmental risk factors. Infection with
human papilloma virus (HPV), in particular HPV16,22–24
is an established risk factor for anal cancer.24,25 Almost all
cases of ASCC are positive for HPV.2,22,23,26 Despite this
strong correlation between HPV and ASCC, there is lim-
ited longitudinal information on the prevalence of anal
HPV infection in the general population. Current evidence
suggests that anal HPV infection in those with HPV-
related anogenital diseases or cervical HPV infection is
common,2,27 but in the majority of infected cases, HPV
clearance occurs in a relatively short time.2,28,29 Factors
that lead to persistent anal HPV infection may thus be of
great importance in the risk of developing anal cancer.
These factors include concurrent cervical HPV infection
and other HPV-related anogenital diseases, receptive anal
intercourse
and
probably
tobacco
smoking.26–29
Furthermore, concomitant infection with human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) indirectly increases the risk of anal
cancer by immunosuppression and increased replication of
HPV.30 Consistent condom use during intercourse may re-
duce the risk of genital HPV infection, although it does not

Anal cancer is linked to current and past sexual prac-
tices that increase the risk of HPV infection or its persist-
ence, including lower age at first intercourse, higher
number of male sexual partners, and receptive anal inter-
course.26,28,29,33,34 Sexual behaviour has been changing to-
wards lower mean age at first intercourse and a higher
number of sexual partners, notably in higher-income coun-
tries.35–37 Little information is available on the prevalence

 of anal intercourse from nationally representative and
comparable surveys. However, a few cross-sectional na-
tional surveys in the USA conducted in the early 1990s and
late 2000s suggest that prevalence of receptive anal inter-
course has increased in both men and women in that coun-
try.38–40 It should be noted however that in many cases, in
particular in women, anal cancer occurs with no history of
receptive anal intercourse.27 The association between re-
ceptive anal intercourse and anal cancer appears to be
weaker in women than in men,26,33 probably because cer-
vical HPV infection is the most important factor for the
persistence of anal HPV infection in women.29An increase
in the prevalence of cervical HPV infection may be the
most plausible explanation for the increase in ACSS inci-
dence rates only in women in several countries that have
seen substantial changes in sexual behaviour in recent dec-
ades.35–37 The increase in cervical cancer incidence rates in
some of these countries (such as the Russian Federation)

 supports this assumption.41 A decrease in incidence rates
of cervical cancer in many other countries, however, may
reflect the role of cervical cancer screening which reduces
cervical cancer incidence rates as a result of treatment of
precancerous lesions.42,43 We observed little change in the
incidence of female ASCC in the Asian countries included
in this analysis, where the number of women’s sexual part-
ners and prevalence of cervical HPV infection have usually
been lower than in Europe or Americas,37,44 supporting
the importance of cervical HPV infection prevalence in
trends in incidence of anal cancer in women.
In both sexes, anal HPV infection and anal cancer are
more common in HIV-infected individuals, in particular
HIV-infected men who have sex with men.16,45,46 The risk
of anal cancer increases with duration of HIV infection.47
Current evidence suggests that the introduction of effective
therapies to control HIV infection, which has resulted in a
substantial increase in survival of HIV-positive individuals,
has been associated with an increase (or at least no de-
crease) in the incidence of anal cancer.47–51 The global epi-
demic of HIV infection started in the early 1980s; after an
increase, the average global prevalence of the infection in
ages 15–49 years has been stable at � 1% since the early
2000s.52–54 The highest increase in prevalence of HIV in-
fection occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (average prevalence
of � 6% since 2000), but for the present analysis we did
not have data on anal cancer occurrence from this region.
A much more modest increase in prevalence, followed by
stabilization, has been reported from most high-income
countries included in this analysis.53 Among the other
included countries, the Russian Federation has had the
highest increase in the number of HIV cases in Europe, and

 Estonia has the highest prevalence among the Baltic
states.53 Our analysis suggests that in view of rapid in-
creases in ASCC incidence rates among Black men in the
USA, HIV infection may have a more significant role in
anal cancer incidence in this group, given that they are dis-
proportionally affected by HIV.55 However, although HIV
infection appears to be one of the reasons for an increase
in anal cancer incidence rates, it cannot totally explain the
temporal pattern. In the USA, for example, HIV does not
seem to be a major determinant of anal cancer trends in
women, and only 1% of female anal cancers occur in
women with HIV infection.56 In fact, whereas the increase
in anal cancer incidence in our analysis is generally greater
in women, in most countries (outside sub-Saharan Africa)
the number of men infected with HIV has been higher than
infected women.53
A number of studies have reported an association be-
tween tobacco smoking and anal cancer.13,26,33,46,57,58
Given a typical lag period between the peak of smoking
and cancer incidence rates in a population (although as yet
unknown for anal cancer), trends in anal cancer rates
among women in many European countries are in line
with an increase in smoking prevalence until recently.59,60
Conversely, smoking prevalence in both men and women
in the USA, Australia and several countries in Northern
Europe has been decreasing for more than four dec-
ades,59,60 whereas anal cancer incidence rates are still
increasing in those countries. Nevertheless, HPV infection
may confound the correlation between smoking and anal
cancer trends, because smoking may primarily increase the
risk of anal cancer by delaying the clearance of anal
HPV.28 A higher incidence of ASCC among the middle-
aged (45–64 years) than in older age groups may reflect
differences in sexual behaviour and prevalence and dur-
ation of HIV infection and smoking61 across age groups,
although the contribution of these factors may vary by sex.
The association between smoking and anal cancer needs
further research.
Immunosuppression
following
transplantation,
and
with some diseases, are associated with an increased risk of
anal cancer.62 Due to the low prevalence of these risk fac-
tors, however, they are unlikely to play a major role in the
overall increase in anal cancer incidence rates. An associ-
ation between some other factors—such as longer duration
of oral contraceptive use and nulliparity among women13
and physical inactivity33—and anal cancer risk has been re-
ported in a few studies, but more research on the causality
of these associations is required before coming to any con-
clusions about the possible impact of these factors in the
observed incidence trends of anal cancer.
Little is known about risk factors of AAC, but anal fis-
tula, chronic local inflammation and Crohn’s disease may
contribute to the development of this subtype of anal can-
cer.63 The information available from the 1980s to early
2000s indicates a steady increase in the incidence of
Crohn’s disease in Japan,64 but in the UK, which has
among the highest incidence and prevalence rates for
Crohn’s disease worldwide and has seen an increase in ad-
mission rates for the disease, the incidence of Crohn’s dis-
ease has not shown a clear trend in recent decades.65,66
Nevertheless, the increase in AAC incidence rates in Japan
may be mostly related to an increase in overlapping
tumours of the rectum and anus; given the very low inci-
dence rate of AAC in Japan, even inclusion of a modest
number of rectal cancer cases as anal cancer might explain
this trend. Another analysis using CI5 data showed an in-
crease in the incidence of colorectal cancer in many coun-
tries
included
in
our
analysis
(Canada,
Colombia,
Denmark, Estonia, Italy, The Netherlands, the Russian
Federation, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland and
the UK) in relatively comparable time periods (up to
2007), but a decrease in the incidence in Australia, France,
Israel, Japan, US Blacks and US Whites.67 Part of the de-
crease in the latter group may be related to colorectal can-
cer screening, which may help to reduce colorectal cancer
incidence by removing precancerous lesions. In any case,
these and our results show that anal and colorectal cancers
do not share the same global trends in incidence, probably
due to differences in their aetiological factors.
A few studies have projected trends in incidence of anal
cancer in the future. One study projected an increase in the
incidence of ASCC in both sexes combined in New South
Wales, Australia, in 2010–32.4 On the other hand, the inci-
dence of AAC, which was much lower compared with
ASCC, was projected to decrease or remain stable.4
Another
analysis
predicted
little
change
in
age-
standardized rates (ASRs) for anal cancer mortality in
either sex in Spain.68 These results are consistent with con-
temporary trends in the above countries in our analysis.
Another analysis predicted little change in the ASRs for
anal cancer mortality from 2006–10 to 2021–25 in either
men (from 0.10 to 0.11 per 100 000) or women (from 0.16
to 0.13) in Brazil.69 It should be noted, however, that anal
cancer mortality rates examined in the latter two studies
may also be influenced by stage at diagnosis and access to
treatment, and may not be directly comparable with anal
cancer incidence rates.
Future perspectives
HPV vaccination can provide protection against anal HPV
infection.70 As it was first made available in 2006, it is
probably too early to see preventive effects of vaccination
of young adults on anal cancer incidence rates in the
934
International Journal of Epidemiology, 2017, Vol. 46, No. 3

 general population, but HPV vaccination has been shown
to prevent anal intraepithelial neoplasia71 and anal can-
cer72 in high-risk groups. Despite benefits of HPV vaccin-
ation in preventing several HPV-related cancers,73 it is yet
to be routinely administered in most low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), or at present the uptake is not
optimal.74 Raising awareness about safer sex is also im-
portant. Without these preventive measures, even popula-
tions with a stable trend for ASCC in this analysis could
see a future increase in the burden of HPV-related diseases,
including anal cancer, as a result of changes in sexual
behaviour.
Currently, mass screening for anal cancer is not recom-
mended because anal cancer is a rare disease, and there is
no evidence that screening for anal cancer improves the
outcome of the disease.75 Some cost-effectiveness analyses
have shown mixed results or no benefit from screening of
high-risk individuals.76,77 However, due to paucity of
data, screening in high-risk groups is a subject for debate.
Based on expert opinion, a few guidelines recommend
regular digital anorectal examination in high-risk individ-
uals.75,78 Some experts suggest annual anal Pap screening
of HIV-infected men who have sex with men, with referral
for high-resolution anoscopy for any abnormal cytology.79
Nevertheless, few national authorities worldwide recom-
mend routine Pap screening at present, even for high-risk
individuals.80 In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend any systematic
screening for anal cancer, but a few state-level authorities
in New York and professional organizations recommend
annual screening in certain high-risk groups.78,81,82
Strength and limitations
The main strengths of this study are the use of longitudinal
data from the cancer registries of high quality (passing
CI5’s inclusion criteria), and the uniform approach applied
in our analysis, allowing comparisons across countries.
This reduces potential problems associated with heterogen-
eity in the definition of the morphological group codes
across a country or between countries. The CI5 series se-
lects only registries that comply with the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)’s standards for
quality of data, and after selection of registries, every effort
is made to standardize the data presented.83 In our ana-
lysis, moreover, we used data from the same registry/regis-
tries from any given country throughout the study period,
to reduce the possibility of any residual heterogeneity in
quality of data that could have been introduced by adding
new registries over time. Therefore, a substantial change in
the observed trends only because of heterogeneity in the
data collection method is unlikely. However, the analysis
of data from several countries was based on small num-
bers, given the rarity of the disease and the size of the
underlying catchment populations. Nevertheless, consist-
ent trends in neighbouring countries within a region imply
that the local data are at least partially representative of
national trends. Although the inclusion of a relatively small
group of anal cancers with an unspecified histology would
lead to underestimation of incidence rates for ASCC and
AAC to some degree, it would have a minimal effect on
temporal trends in our analysis, as the incidence rates for
this group showed little change over time in the popula-
tions considered in this study.
Conclusions
The incidence of anal cancer has been increasing in most
populations included in this study. Reasons for this in-
crease are unknown, but may include a rise in prevalence
of factors that increase the incidence and persistence of
anal HPV infection. Certain preventive measures if imple-
mented, including HPV vaccination and campaigns for
safer sexual behaviours, would serve to prevent a substan-
tial number of anal cancer cases in the future.
