Prior research has found that cognitive benefits of physical exercise and brain health
in older adults may be enhanced when mental exercise is interactive simultaneously,
as in exergaming. It is unclear whether the cognitive benefit can be maximized by
increasing the degree of mental challenge during exercise. This randomized clinical
trial (RCT), the Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise Study (ACES) sought to replicate and
extend prior findings of added cognitive benefit from exergaming to those with or at
risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). ACES compares the effects of 6 months of an
exer-tour (virtual reality bike rides) with the effects of a more effortful exer-score (pedaling
through a videogame to score points). Fourteen community-dwelling older adults meeting
screening criteria for MCI (sMCI) were adherent to their assigned exercise for 6 months.
The primary outcome was executive function, while secondary outcomes included
memory and everyday cognitive function. Exer-tour and exer-score yielded significant
moderate effects on executive function (Stroop A/C; d’s = 0.51 and 0.47); there was no
significant interaction effect. However, after 3 months the exer-tour revealed a significant
and moderate effect, while exer-score showed little impact, as did a game-only condition.
Both exer-tour and exer-score conditions also resulted in significant improvements in
verbal memory. Effects appear to generalize to self-reported everyday cognitive function.
Pilot data, including salivary biomarkers and structural MRI, were gathered at baseline
and 6 months; exercise dose was associated with increased BDNF as well as increased

gray matter volume in the PFC and ACC. Improvement in memory was associated with
an increase in the DLPFC. Improved executive function was associated with increased
expression of exosomal miRNA-9. Interactive physical and cognitive exercise (both high
and low mental challenge) yielded similarly significant cognitive benefit for adherent sMCI
exercisers over 6 months. A larger RCT is needed to confirm these findings. Further
innovation and clinical trial data are needed to develop accessible, yet engaging and
effective interventions to combat cognitive decline for the growing MCI population.

INTRODUCTION
Annual diagnoses of dementia, such as due to Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), are expected to approach 1 million in 2050,
more than double the new cases diagnosed in 2000 (Alzheimer’s
Association, 2014). Lacking a cure for any of the many causes
of this devastating decline in cognitive function and loss of
independence, a rising public health outcry has helped spark
initiatives like the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (2011) and
the Healthy Brain Initiative (Alzheimer’s Association and Centers
for Disease Control Prevention, 2013). Research continues to
press on, seeking innovative and empirically-validated ways to
prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline and impairment.
While behavioral interventions are unlikely to completely
prevent or halt dementia, there is the potential for physical
exercise to reduce the risk of dementia onset (Heyn et al., 2004;
Hillman et al., 2008) or slow progression (Larson, 2010). It has
been estimated that if the onset of dementia could be delayed
a few years, the impact on the population over time could be
dramatic, decreasing prevalence by 1 million cases after 10 years
in the United States alone. By also delaying progression for 2
years this could reduce dementia incidence by an astonishing 18
million cases globally per year (Sano et al., 1997; Brookmeyer
et al., 1998). Interventions that reach patients before they have
declined into diagnosable dementia can have the greatest impact.
Thus, it is especially desirable to develop interventions that target
those who may be at an intermediate stage, perhaps diagnosed
with or at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI; per DSM-
IV in 1994; Jak et al., 2009) also known more recently as mild
neurocognitive disorder (mNCD per DSM-V in 2013; henceforth
MCI will be used for simplicity; Roberts and Knopman, 2013; Jak
et al., 2016).
Neuropsychological Effects of Physical
and Cognitive Exercise
Researchers have been investigating a variety of behavioral
interventions, including exercise, to improve cognitive function
and decrease risk of progression to dementia among individuals
with MCI (e.g., Kramer et al., 1999; Colcombe and Kramer,
2003; Studenski et al., 2006; Angevaren et al., 2008; Baker et al.,
2010; Geda et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2011). Physical exercise has
garnered significant support in the literature for its potency in
effecting cognitive benefits (e.g., Colcombe and Kramer, 2003).
While the literature examining the relationship between physical
exercise and cognitive benefit is not without issues (e.g., recent
Cochrane Reviews; Forbes et al., 2015; Young et al., 2015, which
focused on dementia and normative older adults, respectively),
it is widely accepted that exercise benefits cognition, particularly
executive function among symptomatic individuals, that are yet
early in their cognitive decline (e.g., MCI), the very population
on which this study focused (e.g., Colcombe and Kramer, 2003;
Etnier and Chang, 2009; Geda et al., 2010; Gates, 2013; Hess et al.,
2014; Zheng et al., 2016). Indeed, pre-clinical persons, ranging
from asymptomatic older adults to those with early MCI, may
experience the greatest benefit from exercise, due to the relatively
preserved brain structures and functions (in contrast with more
progressed dementia) that can support and supply components
needed to realize neuroplasticity as triggered by exercise (e.g.,
Colcombe et al., 2004; Kramer and Erickson, 2007; Ahlskog
et al., 2011; Teixeira et al., 2016). However, knowing that physical
exercise may be good for one’s body and brain may not be
enough to induce regular practice of exercise. Most older adults
do not meet the guideline from the American College of Sports
Medicine (ACSM) which now recommends 45 min per day, 5–7
days per week, including vigorous exercise (Chodzko-Zajko et al.,
2009).
In a previous randomized clinical trial (Anderson-Hanley
et al., 2012), we aimed to induce a thorough dose of exercise
(Vidoni et al., 2015) by assigning older adults to an exergame1.
We expected that the engagement of a stimulating exergame
would motivate regular exercise, therefore allowing older adults
to achieve maximum cognitive benefit. Three months of pedaling
a virtual-reality-enhanced stationary ergometer, displaying scenic
bike tours which we referred to as a “cybercycle” (see Figure 1),
was compared with a traditional stationary bike. In the end,
the cybercycle condition yielded significantly greater cognitive
benefit, as hypothesized. However, surprisingly, it was not due to
a difference in dose; we found instead that both the cybercycle
and traditional cyclists has been similarly adherent (e.g., no
significant difference between groups in miles, minutes, power,
heart rate, etc.).
This unexpected finding raised the possibility that the screen
display was providing benefit, beyond that of basic entertainment
1Exergaming is a subset of health games, sometimes referred to as active games,
that combine physical exercise with interactive gaming features, often through
a virtual reality-type platform (Van Schaik et al., 2008; Read and Shortell, 2011;
Stanmore et al., 2017).

or motivation. We theorized the enhanced form of exercise
was yielding findings much like those of the environmental
enrichment literature (e.g., animals provided with greater
physical and mental stimulation experience enhanced brain
function; Pusic et al., 2016); thus it seems more (even two types
at once) is generally better, although to a point. In humans
the complexity of experience and the diversity of type, timing
and compounding of “enrichment” makes this considerably
challenging to study as a unique phenomenon. It seemed that
for our participants, by interacting with the tour stimuli on
screen (e.g., changing pedaling speed yielded a change in speed
of scenery moving by), they were certainlyengaged in some
additional amount of cognitive processing beyond the control
condition. This layered cognitive stimulation may have combined
with the physical exercise required of the exergame to create a
“two-for-one” impact that resulted in the observed additional
cognitive benefit for participants. Hence, we hypothesized that
participants experienced better neuropsychological outcomes
because of the potentially synergistic phenomena created by
combining a type of “mental exercise” that was interactive with
physical exercise (Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012; Frantzidis et al.,
2014).
Several areas of the research literature speak to the possible
validity of this hypothesized compounding or synergistic
effect. As previously mentioned, there is a robust literature
documenting the cognitive benefits of physical exercise. There
is also a growing literature on cognitive training that purports
significant effects (Willis et al., 2006; Karr et al., 2014; Toril
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Huntley et al., 2015; Train the
Brain Consortium, 2017). However, in our view, the claims
are less convincing due to problems with reporting, limited
generalizability, and other reasons that have been cited in
various critiques of the literature and related “brain training”
industry (e.g., Owen et al., 2010; Muijden et al., 2012; Redick
et al., 2013; Boot and Kramer, 2014; Simons et al., 2016;
Zokaei et al., 2016). Indeed, a Cochrane Review of 11 RCTs
concluded there was “no indication of any significant benefits
from cognitive training” (Bahar-Fuchs et al., 2013, p. 1).
Nevertheless, considering some “mixed” results on the potential
benefits of cognitive training, and as well as the animal literature
on neurobiological impact of cognitive enrichments (reviewed
below), there is potential for mental challenge to have its own
benefit on cognition. Although perhaps it is most effectively
implemented as part of a more naturalistic intervention, as
when integrated with physical activity that taps additional neural
mechanisms.
One way to examine this possibility further is to evaluate
the body of literature that encompasses the cognitive effects of
interventions with multiple components (e.g., cognitive training
and physical exercise). Often these are referred to as:
• “combined” interventions, wherein the components are
administered sequentially/in tandem (e.g., Barnes et al., 2013;
Fiatarone et al., 2014; Law et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014;
Rahe et al., 2015; Karssemeijer et al., 2017; Lipardo et al.,
2017),which can be contrasted with:
• “dual-task”
interventions,
wherein
components
are
administered simultaneously, but typically are separate
tasks (e.g., reciting numbers backwards while walking;
Schaefer and Schumacher, 2011; Coelho et al., 2013b; Forte
et al., 2013; Theill et al., 2013; Bherer, 2015; Eggenberger et al.,
2015; Yokoyama et al., 2015; Desjardins-Crépeau et al., 2016),
which can be further contrasted with:
• interactive interventions, as in exergaming, in which the
actions in one realm affect the other (e.g., pedaling and steering
controls progress in a virtual world and attainment of goals;
Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012; Maillot et al., 2012; González-
Palau et al., 2014; Schoene et al., 2014; Bamidis et al., 2015;
Styliadis et al., 2015; Eggenberger et al., 2016; Lauenroth et al.,
2016; Wang et al., 2016; Stanmore et al., 2017).
Indeed, there is a vast literature on “dual-task” experiments
and interventions (Kramer et al., 1985; Hiyamizu et al., 2012;
Kramer and Wong et al., 2015; Hosseini et al., 2017), which
sometimes focus on the limitations of human abilities to manage
two separate (non-interactive tasks) at once (e.g., walking
and counting numbers backwards). Traditionally, the aim of
dual-task training might focus on interference effects (Al-
Yahya et al., 2011) and improving physical outcomes (e.g.,
decreasing falls) for impaired individuals (e.g., post-stroke),
especially while managing dual tasks. More recently, studies
have examined cognitive outcomes in dual tasks wherein there
is more naturalistic interactivity (as in the cybercycle scenario
above; Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012; as well as other interactive
modalities such as dance: Foster, 2013; Kattenstroth et al.,
2013; Dhami et al., 2015; Schoene et al., 2015; Burzynska
et al., 2017; Marquez et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2017; Rehfeld
et al., 2017). These recent studies seem to be converging on a
similar cognitive-enhancing phenomenon that lends empirical
support to the synergistic hypothesis outlined above and in part,
elsewhere (Fissler et al., 2013). Recent reviews of the literature on
the cognitive benefits of exergaming for older adults conclude the
preliminary evidence is promising (Smith et al., 2010; Schoene
et al., 2013; Bamidis et al., 2014; Barry et al., 2014; Chao et al.,
2014; Ogawa et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Zilidou et al., 2016), but
further research of the effects of these interactive interventions
and the impact of specific components (e.g., passive stimulation

vs. active cognitive training, aerobic vs. non-aerobic activity, etc.)
is necessary.
We have previously hypothesized that the benefits of
interactive physical and cognitive exercise may increase with
increased mental effort and our lab published a pilot trial as
a precursor to this present RCT, the Aerobic and Cognitive
Exercise Study pilot (ACES-pilot; Barcelos et al., 2015). The
ACES-pilot sought to investigate whether greater cognitive
challenge while exergaming would yield differential outcomes in
executive function and generalize to everyday functioning. Sixty-
four community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 82) were
randomly assigned to pedal a stationary bike, while interactively
engaging on-screen with: (1) a low cognitive demand task
(pedaling a steering along a virtual bike tour, referred to as
exer-tour), or (2) a high cognitive demand task (pedaling and
steering to chase dragons and score points in a 3D video game,
referred to as exer-score). Executive function (indices from
Trails, Stroop and Digit Span) was assessed before and after a
single-bout and 3-month exercise intervention. A significant
group × time interaction after 3 months of exergaming (Stroop;
among 20 adherents). Those in the high cognitive demand group
performed better than those in the low cognitive dose condition.
Self-reported everyday function improved across both exercise
conditions. These pilot data indicated that for older adults,
cognitive benefit while exergaming increased concomitantly
with higher doses of interactive mental challenge (Barcelos
et al., 2015). The present study aims to replicate and extend that
finding to MCI.
Neurobiological and Neuroimaging Effects
of Physical and Cognitive Exercise
It is our hypothesis that interactivity can produce greater
cognitive effects due to synergistic processes that compound
or magnify the benefit in a non-linear way, perhaps by
activation and utilization of neurobiological substrate of the
mind-body interface that is evolutionarily adapted for success
in naturalistic tasks (in this case, goal-directed motion through
3D space). While theory and research connecting cognitive
processes to neurobiological pathways triggered by exercise
in humans is expanding rapidly, there are indications of
important links with various biomarkers (e.g., brain-derived
neurotrophic factor [BDNF], insulin-like growth factor [IFG-
1]; Cotman et al., 2007; Knaepen et al., 2010), including
expression of microRNA (miRNA) in circulating exosomes
(Pusic et al., 2016; Bertoldi et al., 2017), and brain structure
and function (e.g., gray and white matter regions: Colcombe
et al., 2006; hippocampus; Thomas et al., 2012; Erickson et al.,
2015; Sexton et al., 2016). Animal models have more plainly
linked certain differential, compounding or synergistic cognitive
benefits with neurobiological phenomenon when both physical
and mental exercise are provided (e.g., in laboratory mice
exposed to enriched environments with physical and/or cognitive
challenges; Greenough et al., 1999; Churchill et al., 2002; Olson
et al., 2006; Galvan and Bredesen, 2007; Fabel et al., 2009;
Voss et al., 2013; Jessberger and Gage, 2014). These studies and
others, detail a variety of mechanisms and impacts linking mental
and physical exercise to improved neuronal and brain health
(e.g., via increased cerebral perfusion, neurogenesis, angiogensis,
synaptogenesis; Greenough et al., 1999; Gage, 2002; Trachtenberg
et al., 2002; Tsai et al., 2016; Kleemeyer et al., 2017), even detailing
specific differential benefits (Black et al., 1990; Olson et al., 2006;
Suo et al., 2016) such as cell proliferation with physical exercise,
and cell survival with mental exercise (Van Praag et al., 2005; van
Praag, 2008).
The Present Research
Since

adults
exercise
at
levels recommended by the ACSM and American Heart
Association (AHA; Chodzko-Zajko et al., 2009), and physician
recommendation appears to do little to change sedentary
behaviors (Grandes et al., 2009), the novel exergame utilized
in this study holds the promise of increasing compliance by
virtue of the distracting components of the virtual reality
environment and the interactive and challenging features of
the videogame. Besides being a potentially effective way of
engaging older adults in exercise, the present RCT augments
prior research by exploring the neuropsychological benefits of
interactive cognitive and physical training combined, rather
than focusing on either alone (Colcombe and Kramer, 2003;
Anguera et al., 2013), or in tandem, but lacking interactivity
(Fabre et al., 2002; Oswald et al., 2006; Kraft, 2012; Suzuki et al.,
2012; Hotting and Roder, 2013; Shatil, 2013; González-Palau
et al., 2014; Satoh et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2014; Suo et al.,
2016). By examining the neuropsychological effects some of
the components separately (e.g., physical exercise and mental
exercise alone), this study attempts to tease apart the unique
contributions of each component to any benefit to cognition, as
well as the potentially differential effect of low- vs. high-cognitive
demands. The present research specifically examines the benefits
of these behavioral interventions for community-dwelling older
adults with or at risk for MCI and thus, attempts to extend
previous findings to this more vulnerable population.
Finally, this RCT examines potential underlying mechanisms
of effects of combined physical and mental exercise on cognition
through the collection of neurobiological and neuroimaging
data. Prior research has begun to clarify the role a number
of biomarkers (primarily from serum, CNS, or saliva) that
change in accord with exercise interventions and appear to
be linked improvements in brain health that and/or promote
improvements in cognition. For example, exercise has been
shown to yield: increases in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor
(BDNF; Cotman et al., 2007; Coelho et al., 2013a; Leckie et al.,
2014; Vaughan et al., 2014; Dinoff et al., 2016; Maass et al.,
2016) and variable responses of insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF-1; Lorens-Martín et al., 2009). Research linking traditional
physical exercise and cognition in older adults has identified
BDNF and IGF-1 as biomarkers linking cognitive function and
healthy aging (Voss et al., 2010; Bellar et al., 2011; Erickson et al.,
2012; Hotting and Roder, 2013; Phillips et al., 2014; Szuhany
et al., 2014; Geerlings et al., 2015; Lara et al., 2015; Maass et al.,
2016). BDNF plays an important role in neuronal growth and
survival, it modulates neurotransmitters, and is involved in the
cascade to promote neuronal plasticity, while IGF-1 has also

Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise Study for MCI
been implicated as a mechanism in exercise-induced neuronal
plasticity (Voss et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2013; Phillips et al.,
2015; Maass et al., 2016). Cotman et al. (2007) has presented a
model in which exercise induces activity of BDNF and IGF-1 in
multiple pathways that facilitate: (a) learning, (b) neurogenesis,
and (c) angiogenesis. Furthermore, some research has found
increases in vascular endothelial growth factor with exercise
(VEGF; Vital et al., 2014). While growth factors are typically said
to increase with exercise, there are number of reports of decreases
in inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein and Interleukin-
6 (CRP and IL6; Thielen et al., 2016; Monteiro-Junior et al.,
2017). Additionally, recent progressive research has also been
examining the potential for circulating exosomes to serve as early
markers of neuropathology, such as AD, to act as delivery vehicles
for potentially reparative miRNA expressions, and even to play
a positive role the neurbiological effects of exercise (e.g., Zhang
et al., 2014; Kumar and Reddy, 2016; Pusic et al., 2016; Batistela
et al., 2017; Bertoldi et al., 2017). Some promising research has
pointed to miRNA-9 and miRNA-193 as linked to benefit in
neurobiological processes such that they play a therapeutic role
in dementia (e.g., Russell et al., 2013; Párrizas et al., 2015; Li et al.,
2016; Riancho et al., 2017).
In sum, exercise appears to be able to trigger or enhance
the function of complex cascades of neurobiological processes
that have sometimes been linked to cognitive benefits or other
expressions of brain or CNS health. It is likely that a number
of those processes act on neurophysiological substrate to foster
improved brain health that leads to improved cognition; some
of those mediating phenonmena may even be visible through
structural imaging.
Structural changes in certain regions of the brain have been
found to follow exercise and are often linked to concomitant
changes in cognition; for example, increases in the hippocampus
(Lorens-Martín et al., 2009; Erickson et al., 2011), as well as
the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex,
and more broadly the prefrontal cortex (ACC, DLPC, and PFC;
Gordon et al., 2008; Erickson et al., 2011; Weinstein et al., 2012;
Curlik and Shors, 2013; Hayes et al., 2013; Nishiguchi et al., 2015;
ten Brinke et al., 2015; Jonasson et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017). While
the body of research has been growing with respect to linking
physical exercise and cognition via biomarkers, scant literature
has yet explored how these indicators and mechanisms react in
the case of combined or interactive mental and physical exercise
interventions in humans, wherein there might be somewhat
differential or compounding beneficial effects given a two-for-
one intervention (for a promising exception, see Eggenberger
et al., 2016). The present study aims to address a number of these
gaps and replicate or extend other findings in the literature.
Hypotheses
This study is a partial replication and extension of the ACES-
pilot (Barcelos et al., 2015) and it was hypothesized that, similar
to that which was found in that prior pilot study: physical
exercise interactive with effortful cognitive challenge (exer-score;
Figure 2), would produce greater cognitive benefit than physical
exercise that was interactive with relatively passive cognitive
processing (exer-tour). We expected this previously observed
phenomenon to extend to MCI specifically. The primary aim
of the trial was for community-dwelling older adults with or
at risk for MCI to engage their assigned intervention regularly
for 6 months (longer than the ACES-pilot, which extended only
to 3 months). Baseline to 6-month intervention (exer-tour vs.
exer-score) were hypothesized to yield these effects:
1. executive function would increase significantly after either
exer-score and exer-tour (within subjects main effect)
2. executive function would increase significantly more for exer-
score (high mental challenge) than for exer-tour (low mental
challenge; between subjects interaction effect)
3. effects of either exer-score or exer-tour would exceed that of

METHODS
Participants
All study procedures were approved by the appropriate
Institutional Review Boards (i.e., including the PI’s institution
and the three medical centers where the study was conducted;
see section Author Notes). Older adults with a diagnosis of
MCI were initially sought via referrals from neurology and
neuropsychology at three medical centers in a specific region
of upstate New York where participants were to exercise (using
a cybercyle placed at each center’s physical therapy clinic).
However, given difficulties enrolling patients (especially due
to travel requirements, but also due to challenges targeting
patients with MCI before progression to dementia), further
IRB approval was obtained to expand recruitment by locating
additional cybercycles at several more locations around the
region (e.g., retirement communities, YMCAs, etc.) for a total of
14 sites. Enrollment was thus expanded to include self-referred
community-dwelling older adults, aiming to include especially
those that might be undiagnosed (because symptoms had not
affected function), but yet who might meet criteria for, or could
be said to be at risk for MCI (e.g., thus those that would meet
screening criteria for MCI, herein referred to as “screened
as MCI” or sMCI2). Participants were recruited using fliers,
2Screened as MCI (sMCI) based on a MoCA cut-off score for MCI of <26
(Nasreddine et al., 2005). This screening approach was utilized after initial planned
attempts to enroll clinically diagnosed patients with MCI (e.g., recruited from
neurologists, neuropsychologists, and geriatricians, yielded patients that had often

limitations that would restrict participation in cognitive testing
or exercise. After reviewing the informed consent form (ICF)
and answering all questions, a signed document was obtained
from all participants and their surrogate, if appropriate, based
on the Impaired Decision Making Capacity screen (IDMC;
Karlawish, 2008). Physician approval (PCP and if applicable,
cardiologist) was obtained for all participants to engage in
exercise as assigned. Enrollees (n = 111) were community-
dwelling older adults with a mean age of 78.1 (SD = 9.9), who
were predominantly female (66%), well educated (average years
of education = 16.2, SD = 2.4) Causasians (three individuals self-
reported minority ethnic/racial status). Participants scored on
average 23.7 (SD = 3.1) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA; 30-point multidimensional scale, with higher scores
indicative of better global cognitive function; Nasreddine et al.,
2005; Freitas et al., 2012; Julayanont et al., 2014), such that 75%
of enrollees were categorized at meeting screening criteria for
sMCI (“screened as MCI” based on MoCA < 26; Nasreddine
et al., 2005).
To provide an additional point of comparison of the relative
effect of physical exercise alone vs. interactively combined
with mental exercise, archival data was culled from our prior
already progressed in their decline toward dementia). Indeed, by the time some
patients had been referred for clinical evaluations, received a formal diagnosis and
subsequently were referred to our study, their disease had progressed such that
they no longer fit our target population of MCI. As a result, attempts to enroll such
referrals led to exclusion as the patient sometimes would be unable to understand
or participate in the research and/or complex intervention procedures.
Cybercycle Study. In that study, 33 participants were randomly
assigned to a traditional exercise or “pedal-only” condition in
which participants pedaled a stationary bike (in many cases the
same model as used in the present study), but without the virtual
reality display (see below for between group comparisons at
baseline; for additional details see Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012,
2014; Dimitrova et al., 2016).
Baseline Comparisons Between Groups
Between the three randomly assigned groups in the present
study (exer-tour, exer-score, and game-only; n = 46, 45, 20,
respectively), cognitive measures revealed that the groups were
comparable (no significant differences) on: overall cognitive
function (MoCA), rate of sMCI, and performance on individual
tests of cognition including: executive function, visual spatial
skill, and memory (verbal, nonverbal, list, story, immediate or
delayed).
On behavioral measures, those who were in the game-only
condition were somewhat less motivated to be in the study,
were not as ready for exercise, and reported they were more
sedentary (recall that some participants were randomly assigned
to game-only, but others were recruited specifically to the
condition, including with remuneration, due to a high dropout
rate once randomly assigned participants learned they would not
be engaging in a physical exercise component). However, self-
reported cognitive engagement (both recent and lifetime), was
similar across all three groups.
Baseline comparisons between the four groups, including the
above three, but also a pedal-only condition (archival control
group data from our prior study noted above; n = 33), revealed
that all four groups were similar (no significant differences) on:
the three primary outcome measures of executive function to
be the focus of our study (i.e., ratio scores for Digits, Trails,

and Stroop; see below for details). The four groups were also
comparable in proportion of men and women and BMI, but the
pedal-only condition was significantly older and had fewer years
of education3 (confirming use of age and education covariates in
statistical analyses).
Procedures
Participants were initially randomly assigned to one of three
conditions for 6 months: (1) exer-tour: physical exercise
interactive with relatively passive, low cognitive load, virtual
scenic bike tour; or (2) exer-score: physical exercise interactive
with a relatively effortful, high cognitive demand, videogame
(see Figure 2 for sample screen shots); or (3) game-only: the
same videogame operated by a joystick or keyboard (no physical
exercise was required). Exercise participants pedaled a virtual
reality enhanced, recumbent stationary bike (Expresso S3R, from
Interactive Fitness Holdings, LLC). Individuals in the exer-tour
condition pedaled through various virtual scenic bike tours while
3This difference is surmised to be likely due to differences in recruitment as the
prior, Cybercycle Study, only included participants exercising at their residential
facility, whereas the present study included those that could travel to exercise
equipment, often at locations across town.
steering along the path (but without significant consequence for
not steering; that is the bike would coast along the curb and
one could pass through other riders fluidly). Those in the exer-
score condition pedaled through a scenic landscape where the
goal was to score points by collecting different colored coins
and corresponding colored dragons. Throughout the videogame
(either exer-score or game-only), participants could navigate
through bonus items to increase their speed and score, while
avoiding penalties (e.g., steering into water). The exer-tour
condition was presumed to require less mental engagement than
the videogame conditions, as the game called for scoring and
thus, potentially effortful planning, tracking, multi-tasking, and
strategizing (a validity check of this assumption was confirmed
by those in the exer-score condition who reported expending
significantly greater “mental effort” than those in the exer-
score condition; see Table 1). Participants were provided “thank
you gifts” (e.g., water- bottle, mug, etc.) at each of evaluation
(baseline, 3-month, and 6-month).
Given difficulty retaining participants in the game-only
condition (due to preference for active/physical exercise,
boredom once started, etc.), the protocol was again adjusted,
with IRB approval, to allow randomly assigned game-only
participants to switch to the exer-score condition at the 3-month

mid-point evaluation. Additionally, game-only participants were
also recruited separately with modest periodic remuneration
provided. Upon enrollment, participants were phone screened
for eligibility and administered the Impaired Decision-Making
Capacity structured interview (IDMC; Veterans Administration
Medical Center (VAMC), 2007) and provided informed consent
(co-signed by a surrogate or legally-authorized representative
as applicable and/or per the IDMC). Once scheduled for an
initial evaluation, participants were mailed the ICF, demographic,
health and fitness history questionnaires. If they were willing, an
MRI (3T) of the brain was scheduled. At the baseline evaluation,
a saliva sample was collected (passive drool), and they were
administered a neuropsychological test battery (specified below).
Individuals were trained in the use of the equipment for their
assigned condition and underwent a single bout of exercise
for 20 min. Participants were asked to maintain a target heart
rate level, which was calculated using the Karvonen equation
(McAuley et al., 2011) and measured via steering hand-grips
built into the cybercycle (displayed on screen for participant
monitoring and captured by onboard computer for later data
extraction and analysis). Post-testing was conducted following
the single bout4 (SB) of exercise.
4single-bout results are not reported herein in part due to space constraints,
but also given the focus of the RCT on long-term intervention results which
Following the baseline (BL) evaluation, individuals were
instructed to exercise for at least 20 min at least twice a week, and
to gradually increase exercise duration to 45 min and frequency
to at least three to five times per week until the 3-month (3M)
mid-point evaluation, and then maintain that pattern though
a 6-month (6M) final evaluation. Participants were instructed
to aim toward their individualized specific target heart rate
(per above) throughout the intervention period. Participants
were also asked to document their exercise sessions on log
pages provided in a binder and used to calculate adherence
statistics (e.g., frequency, heart rate average, etc.); additionally,
the computer onboard the cybercycle captured similar data which
was used for spot verification. A final evaluation, including repeat
necessarily analyzes a different/smaller sample of those adherent for 6-months;
furthermore the single-bout was not a part of a priori hypotheses in the study
design, but rather included to accompany the training session and provide a repeat
testing experience/familiarization with tests before the follow-up evaluations
(3 M and 6 M) which would partly help “wash out”/reach sooner the plateau of
practice/learning effects and thus more plainly isolate intervention effects at the
follow-up evaluations; finally, the single-bout assessment provides a consistent
pattern with our prior RCTs (the Cybercycle Study and the ACES-pilot) in which
similarly a second round of testing before the long-term outcome for similar
reasons, as such this increases comparability of our data across trials and time-
points (both in terms of amount of familiarization with testing and matching of
alternate forms at each time-point).

neuropsychological, biomarker, and neuroimaging assessments,
was conducted at the end of the 6-month intervention period.
MEASURES
Primary Measures
Cognitive Function
Paper and pencil tests comprised the battery and alternate forms
of cognitive tests were utilized at each evaluation to minimize
practice/learning effects from serial testing. Cognitive testing
was done at baseline (BL) before starting the intervention, after
the 20-min training single-bout session, at a 3-month (3M)
mid-point, and after concluding the 6-month (6M) intervention
period.
Executive Function (Primary Outcome)
Three tests were selected to assess aspects of executive function,
which has been shown to be a complex, yet overarching
domain of cognitive function. The following three tests were
chosen as they are thought to tap overlapping, yet distinct
components of executive function, particularly mental flexibility
(i.e., Stroop for inhibition, Trails for set shifting, and Digit Span
for working memory; Wecker et al., 2000; Strauss et al., 2006).
Executive function is critical cognitive function for maintaining
independence in later life and thus an important focus of this
study’s intervention efforts (Pereira et al., 2008; Marshall et al.,
2011).
Stroop (Van der Elst et al., 2006)
A short, 40-item version of Stroop was administered. Colored
squares (red, green, blue) were presented in rows first (Stroop
A), followed by those color words typed in black ink (Stroop
B), followed by incongruent color words (Stroop C; in which
participants were asked to name the color of the ink while
ignoring the written word). A ratio was computed to isolate
the executive function component of the task (Stroop A/C;
Lansbergen et al., 2007). Among older adults, the ratio score
has reasonable test-retest reliability (0.68) over 1–2 months
(Ettenhofer et al., 2006) and strong test-retest reliability (0.80)
over 2 weeks using the shortened version used herein (Houx et al.,
2002). Higher ratios indicate better executive function.
Color trails (D’Elia et al., 1996)
Color Trails 1, requires participants to connect numbered circles
in ascending order. Color Trails 2, requires individuals to connect
numbered circles in consecutive order while also alternating the
color of the circle (pink or yellow). Following the pattern set by
Lansbergen et al. (2007) above of isolating the executive function
component by dividing basic and faster processing speed by the
slower interference trial, a ratio score (Trails1/2) was computed.
Reliability and validity are adequate (D’Elia et al., 1996). Higher
ratios represent better executive function.
Digit span (Strauss et al., 2006)
Digit Span Forward requires participants to first listen to a list
of numbers and repeat them, with the string length increasing
to the maximum of their ability. Digit Span Backward, requires
repeating a string of numbers in reverse order. Continuing the
pattern above to isolate the executive function component, the
ratio of the typically smaller sum of correct interference trials
on Digit Span Backward, divided by the typically greater sum of
correct basic attention trials on Digit Span Forward (DigitsB/F).
Good reliability and validity have been reported for Digit Span
(Strauss et al., 2006). An increase in the ratio was the desired
outcome.
Secondary Measures (Characterization of
Sample and Possible Additional Outcomes)
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine
et al., 2005)
The MoCA was administered at baseline to characterize the
sample as either normative aging or “screened as MCI” (sMCI;
see details above). The MoCA consists of eight different subtests
to assess overall cognitive impairment. Scores below 26 out of 30
were used to categorize sMCI (Nasreddine et al., 2005).
Ecological Validity (EV; Self-Reported Cognitive
Function; Klusmann et al., 2010)
In an attempt to measure any generalized, clinically relevant,
effects of the interventions (beyond any training to the tests
that might occur when using standardized, serial testing),
a participant self-report of perceived cognitive function was
utilized. Participants were asked about their self-perceptions and
beliefs related to their everyday functioning in regards to their
cognitive functioning (e.g., memory and concentration). The
Ecological Validity Questionnaire (Klusmann et al., 2010) was
administered at BL, 3M and 6M. This measure consists of eleven
statements that ask about participants perceptions of memory,
concentration, and everyday function. Using a 5-point Likert
scale (1 = absolutely wrong / bad to 5 = absolutely true / good),
participants rated how much each of the statements described
their behavior over the past 2 weeks. The total score can range
from 11 to 55, with higher scores representing perceptions of
better cognitive functioning.
Verbal Memory (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment
Scale; ADAS Word List—Immediate and Delayed
Recall; Harrison et al., 2007; Podhorna et al., 2016).
Participants are shown a list of 11 words on cards and they
recall as many as they are able immediately and also after a delay
interval. The number of errors/omissions comprises the score, so
lower scores are better.
Get-up-and-go Test (Podsiadlo and Richardson,
1991)
Participants rise from sitting, walk 10 feet, turn around and
return to sitting position. The time it takes to complete the task is
the score. Lower scores are better.
Other Measures Include
The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q; 0–7,
higher scores indicates barriers to readiness; NASM) and Self-
reported Physical Activity (SRPA); mental and physical effort
thermometers; Exercise Induced Feeling Inventory (EIFI); the
Confusion and Vigor subscales of the Brunel Mood Scale (Terry

et al., 2003); experience of Flow (Payne et al., 2011), and other
neuropsychological measures (e.g., Rey-O, NAART, etc.) not
expected to be affected by the intervention, but included for
separate use in full characterization of enrollees for later cross-
sectional analyses. Due to the focus of this report on a priori
hypotheses, and that the small adherent sample available for
final analysis and circumscribes statistical power, some of these
measures will be reported separately in cross-sectional or other
limited analysis.
Exploratory Measures
The following biomarker and neuroimaging data were collected
from some willing and able participants, who comprised a
small subset of the enrolled participants. Due to the small and
incomplete sample, we report these as pilot data to examine
comparisons that were planned a priori and provide tentative
findings, which may be useful in directing future research.
Biomarkers
Saliva samples (passive drool per Salimetrics protocol) were
collected at: BL, SB, 3M, and 6M from willing and able
participants. Samples were centrifuged, with a portion reserved
for protein analyses and a portion further processed for
exosome analyses. Exosomes were isolated from whole saliva
via differential ultracentrifugation as described in previously
published protocols (Thery et al., 2006; Gallo and Alevizos,
2013; Witwer et al., 2013). Briefly, whole saliva was subjected to
differential centrifugation steps at 300 × g, 1,500 × g, 17,000 × g,
and 160,000 × g. The exosome pellet was suspended in 1X PBS.
All samples were stored at −80◦C until analyses were conducted.
Protein Assays
Frozen samples were shipped overnight on dry ice for analysis
(to RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA). Protein concentrations of
BDNF, CRP, IGF-1, IL-6, and VGEF were obtained via ELISAs
(e.g., Mandel et al., 2011). Each patient sample was run in
duplicate using 100 ml of plasma diluted by a factor of 2.
A commercial multiplexed sandwich ELSIA-based array was
used (Quantibody custom array, RayBiotech Inc., Norcross,
GA, USA). All of the samples were tested using a panel of
cytokines per above. The antibody array is a glass-chip-based
multiplexed sandwich ELISA system designed to determine
the concentrations all cytokines simultaneously. One standard
glass slide was spotted with 16 wells of identical biomarker
antibody arrays. Each antibody, together with the positive and
negative control, was arrayed in quadruplicate. The samples
and standards were added to the wells of the chip array
and incubated for 3 h at 4 uC. This was followed by three
to four washing steps and the addition of primary antibody
and HRP-conjugated streptavidin to the wells. The signals
(Cy3 wavelengths: 555 nm excitation, 655 nm emission) were
scanned and extracted with an Innopsys laser scanner (Innopsys,
Carbonne France), and quantified using Quantibody Analyzer
software (Ray Biotech Inc). Each signal was identified by its spot
location. The scanner software calculated background signals
automatically. Concentration levels, expressed in picograms per
milliliter (pg/ml), were calculated against a standard curve set for
each biomarker from the positive and negative controls.
Exosome Analyses
Frozen samples were shipped overnight on dry ice for analysis
(to VY at Oklahoma State University). The exosome/PBS
solution was lyophilized for 9 h and RNA extraction was
performed using TrizolTM reagent (Life Technologies R
�, catalog
# 15596026.PPS) following the manufacturer’s protocol. A
fixed volume of 1,000 ng RNA was reverse-transcribed using
the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Appled
Biosystems, catalog #: 4368814). PCR forward and reverse
primers for the human miRNA-193 (forward: CTTTTGGAG
GCTGTGGTCTCAGAATC; reverse: CCAGTTGGATAAAAC
ATAAACTCATCTCGCC) and miRNA-9 (forward: AGGCGGG
GTTGGTTGTTATCTTTG; reverse: CTAGCTTTATGAAGACT
CCACACCACTCATAC) were used for real-time quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) amplification. miRNA-193 and miRNA-9
expression was normalized against the U6 housekeeping miRNA
(forward: GTGCCTGCTTCGGCAGC; reverse: TATGGAACGC
TTCACGAATTTGCGTG).
The real-time qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR R
� Select
Master Mix (ThermoFisher, cat #: 4472919). 100 ng of cDNA was
loaded per well and amplified for 45 cycles using Opticon R
� 2
real-time PCR instrument (Biorad, model #: CFB-3220) operated
by Opticon Monitor 3 software. All samples and references were
run in triplicate and each well contained 20 µL total volume. Raw
florescence readings were directly imported into, and baseline
corrected with, LinregPCR software package (Version 2016.1).
Linear regression was performed on the baseline-corrected data
to calculate efficiency using a common window-of-linearity for
each primer pair (Ruijter et al., 2009). Between-session variations
were estimated using a maximum likelihood approach (Ruijter
et al., 2006) and inter-plate variability was minimized using
factor correction calculated using Factor qPCR software (Version
2016.0). Taking into account the reaction efficiency of each
primer set, we used REST 2009 software package (Version 2.0.13,
QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) to calculate the relative RNA
expression ratios in samples by a Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation
Randomization model with 8000 iterations and a combination of
randomization and bootstrapping techniques (Pfaffl et al., 2002).
Neuroimaging
Brain imaging T1-weighted 3D MP-RAGE axial images were
acquired with a Siemens MAGNETOM Verio 3T MRI scanner
running syngo MR B19 software, using an 32-channel bodycoil
using the following parameters: 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.3 mm3 voxel
size; 256 × 256 matrix; 25 cm field of view; flip angle = 8◦;
echo time = 2.9 ms; repetition time = 1,640 ms; inversion
time = 828 ms. Gray matter (GM) volume was analyzed
using FreeSurfer software v. 5.3.05 (Fischl et al., 2002), in a
Linux environment, as described in detail previously (Destrieux
et al., 2010). Briefly, cortical reconstruction and volumetric
segmentation require the initial motion correction and averaging
of T1 images, signal intensity normalization, the removal
of non-brain tissue, automated Talairach transformation and
segmentation of gray and white matter6, and the parcellation

of the cortex into well-described units, using gyral and sulcal
landmarks for automatic differentiation. Each segmented brain
volume was then inspected visually for processing errors
which can occur during automation, and these were corrected
using manual edits and re-processed. The Longitudinal Stream
pipeline, available in Freesurfer v.5.3.0 (see website7), was used
to create an unbiased within-subject template for the two
timepoints in the present study (Reuter et al., 2012). Moreover,
we expect good reliability and a minimal risk of bias-introduction
with the automated pipeline, given that the within-subject scans
took place in the same scanner using the same parameters and
our focus was on cortical ROIs, which show somewhat better
scan-rescan reliability than subcortical structures (e.g., Mills and
Tamnes, 2014).
Given the literature cited above and a prioi hypotheses, the
regions-of-interest (ROIs) included: hippocampus, dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC)8. Freesurfer does not directly extract
these ROIs as they are not singular regions of the brain (see
discussion above as to why they are structurally and functionally
significant in the present context). As such, we defined our ROIs
by combining the following Freesurfer labels: DLPFC = frontal
middle gyrus and sulcus from the Destrieux et al. (2010) atlas;
ACC = rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortices from the
Desikan et al. (2006) atlas; PFC = ACC + medial orbitofrontal
and transverse frontopolar regions (Domenech and Koechlin,
2015). The DLPFC ROI that was chosen is one of the most
conservative and non-controversial groupings, although some
others have included more medial and/or caudal regions in
their work (Vijayakumar et al., 2014; Jonasson et al., 2017).
The volumes extracted are a measure of total gray matter only
(white matter was parcellated separately and excluded). For the
final analysis, GM volumes of each region were extracted and
considered as a ratio to total intracranial volume to account for
variations in brain size. Given the small sample size, volumetric
ratios were used in parametric partial correlations with cognitive
outcomes (controlling for age and sex).
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23 for Windows
(IBM Corporation). The primary goal of the RCT was to
examine, for those with sMCI, the possible differential effects
(via neuropsychological, neurobiological, and neuroimaging
measures) of long-term use of different combinations of physical
and cognitive exercise (exer-tour vs. exer-score). Analyses
focused on those sMCI participants that adhered to the protocol
(approximating the minimum prescribed dose by averaging
3×/wk for 6 months, allowing for 2 weeks of vacation, illness, or
equipment failure, in each of the 3-month evaluation windows).
Given the small sample of completers, there was concern about
insufficient power since a priori power analysis suggested a larger
sample was indicated (Faul et al., 2007). Additionally, small

samples often violate assumptions of standard parametric tests.
However, the data for the primary outcome variables was found
to be normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk tests for StroopA/C,
Trails1/2, and DigF/B were 0.52, 0.71, 0.16, respectively; Normal
Q-Q plots were also reviewed which appeared to be normally
distributed, with data following a linear pattern) and error
variances were consistent with parametric assumptions (Levine’s
tests were not significant). Furthermore, given the importance
of covariates (more readily implemented in parametric tests),
along with the possibility that effects could be magnified in
the sMCI sample, and following guidance in the literature on
statistical strength of ANCOVA above nonparametric approach,
especially in clinical trials (wherein a focus on change from
baseline facilitates a trend toward normality; Vickers, 2005),
it was decided to proceed with standard parametric analyses.
Repeated measure ANOVAs, controlling for age and education
were used to examine group (exer-tour vs. exer-score) × time
(BL vs. 3M and 6M) interaction effects on the primary outcome
measures of executive function. Covariates entered into the
repeated measures analyses included: age and education, due to
links to outcomes noted in the theoretical and empirical literature
(Hannay and Lezak, 2004; Lam et al., 2013). Paired t-tests were
used to evaluate within group change from baseline to the 3-
month mid-point, and baseline to conclusion of the 6-month
intervention.
Partial correlations, controlling for age and sex (based on
prior literature demonstrating links to secondary outcomes; e.g.,
BNDF decreases with age: Lommatzsch et al., 2005; brain region
variability with sex: Ruigrok et al., 2014), were conducted to
explore the relationship between cognitive change and possible
corresponding change in biomarkers (proteins and exosomes)
and neuroimaging regions of interest, per above hypotheses.
Further correlations were conducted to explore relationships
between baseline memory and exercise dose as represented by
ride frequency.
RESULTS
Effect on Primary Outcome: Executive
Function
Full (6-Month) Intervention (Exer-Tour vs. Exer-Score)
Fourteen participants who met criteria for sMCI (MoCA <
26) were adherent to the protocol approximating the minimum
assigned weekly average of 3×/week over 6 months. Half
had been randomized to exer-tour and half to exer-score.
After 6 months of interactive physical and cognitive exercise,
the repeated measures ANCOVA omnibus test of executive
function measures revealed a non-significant group x time
interaction effect, F(3, 7) = 0.85, p = 0.51, ηp2 = 0.27. Univariate
tests for StroopA/C, Trails1/2, and DigB/F were also not
significant (p = 0.82, 0.11, 0.99, respectively). Paired t-tests
were conducted to examine the change within groups over
6 months and StroopA/C improved significantly in both the
exer-tour, t(1, 5) = −2.6, p = 0.049, and exer-score conditions;
t(1, 6) = −5.5; p = 0.001 (Figure 4); Trails1/2 and DigB/F did not
change significantly in either group (Table 2). Paired t-tests of the

change from baseline to the mid-point (3M) evaluation revealed
no significant differences between the exer-tour and exer-score
conditions at that point among sMCI participants (n = 14) that
were adherent through 6 months (Table 2). sMCI participants
who had been assigned to either exer-tour or exer-score and were
not adherent over 6 months (n = 54) did not differ significantly
from adherent sMCI participants (n = 14) on any baseline
variables (including demographics, cognitive, physiological and
functional variables; Table 1).
Mid-point (3-Month) Intervention (Exer-Tour vs.
Exer-Score vs. Game-Only vs. Pedal-Only)
Given the high level of attrition from the game-only condition,
as noted above, a mid-course adjustment was made to enroll
game-only participants into a 3M-only intervention window.
Doing so provided some comparative data regarding the possible
relative effect of the mental exercise component separate from
physical exercise (videogame practice only). Additionally, we
were able to extract comparative 3M control data from our prior
Cybercycle Study regarding the effect of a pedal-only condition
for older adults. These 3M analyses utilized all older adults
(sMCI + normative9) that were adherent through 3M in their
assigned condition (thus the n’s for exer-tour, exer-score, game-
only, and pedal-only were: 15, 19, 8, 31, respectively). Paired t-
tests were conducted and revealed significant gains on StroopA/C
by 3M for exer-tour and pedal-only, with statistically significant
moderate effects (d = 0.49 and 0.35, respectively; Figure 5),
while exer-score and game-only yielded non-significant small
9The 3M analyses were not limited to sMCI, because added comparison of the
fourth group at 3M (the pedal-only condition from the archival dataset; Anderson-
Hanley et al., 2012), could not be sorted by the same sMCI criteria used in the
present study (MoCA scores were not available for pedal-only participants). Thus,
the decision was made to utilize all adherents (normative + sMCI) at 3M from the
four groups to retain comparability within the 3M comparisons.
effects (d = 0.14 and 0.13, respectively). TrailsA/B and DigF/B
did not change significantly. The 6M effect sizes for the two
conditions that progressed to 6M (exer-score and exer-tour) are
also included in Figure 4 and reveal that both the exer-tour and
exer-score conditions yielded statistically significant moderate
effects by 6M (d = 0.52 and 0.47, respectively); thus, the exer-
score group seems to “catch up” to the exer-tour from 3 to
6M.
Effect on Secondary Outcomes
Full (6-Month) Intervention (Exer-Tour vs. Exer-Score)
There were significant group x time interactions among the
14 sMCI adherents for: (1) immediate verbal memory (exer-
tour improved significantly more than exer-score; p = 0.018),
(2) self-report of everyday cognitive function (as assessed
on the Ecological Validity Questionnaire), with exer-tour
reporting significantly more improvement while exer-score
reported decline; p = 0.046), and (3) physical ability (exer-
tour increased significantly more than exer-score; p = 0.001;
see Table 3).
Biomarkers10
Biomarker samples were sought from all participants, but not
all were willing or able to provide saliva samples (data from
completers was available from a maximum of n = 16 for
analysis). Target analytes included: BDNF, CRP, IGF-1, IL-
6, and VEGF. Due to low concentrations of IGF-1 in the
samples collected, the assay results were below the limit of
detection on too many samples and this assay was excluded
from analyses. Partial correlations (controlling for age and sex;
Table 4) were conducted to examine the change from baseline
to 6M in biomarkers related to change in the primary outcome
measure, executive function (StroopA/C) which, per above,
changed significantly with the intervention. Similarly, change in
biomarkers were correlated with a secondary outcome that was
impacted significantly by both interventions, was verbal memory,
and we chose to focus on delayed verbal memory specifically
(ADAS errors), since one of the more salient cognitive functions
to impact for MCI patients. Finally, the exercise dose, based
on average number of rides, was examined for association with
the biomarkers change to evaluated the possibility of a dose
effect. Exercise dose (rides) was found to correlate significantly
with an increase in BDNF (r = 0.50, p = 0.04). Delayed recall
errors showed a trend toward a moderate inverse correlation with
increased VEGF such that better memory performance tended to
coincide with increasing VEGF (r = −0.42, p = 0.08). Exosome
analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between
miRNA-9 expression with improved StroopA/C performance
(r = 0.98, p = 0.002).
Neuroimaging7
Neuroimaging (3T structural MRI) was grant-funded and sought
from all participants, but not all were willing or able to undergo
imaging (data from completers was available from a maximum
10Results for bioassay and neuroimaging data analyses are to be interpreted
tentatively as exploratory pilot results, given the small sample sizes even with
collapsing across conditions.

and was obtained during the Cybercycle Study (Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012), which examined only a 3-month interval and was collected from older adults in the

of n = 8 for analysis). Partial correlations, just as described
above, are reported in Table 5. Greater exercise dose (number
of rides over 6M) was positively correlated with increasing PFC
(r = 0.80, p = 0.003) and ACC (right; r = 0.70, p = 0.05;
Figure 6). Verbal memory (delayed recall) errors were inversely
related to increasing DLPFC, such that improvement in memory
corresponded to increasing volume (r = −0.80, p = 0.01;
Figure 6).
DISCUSSION
This RCT was an attempt to replicate and extend findings of prior
research, which found greater cognitive benefit for older adults
engaged in interactive mental and physical exercise (i.e., while
exergaming using a cybercycle; Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012)
and furthermore, given pilot data which suggested greater mental
challenge may increase cognitive benefit of exergaming (Barcelos
et al., 2015). This RCT examined whether similar effects would
be found among community-dwelling older adults with or at
risk for MCI (screened as MCI; sMCI). We hypothesized that a
more mentally challenging exergame would yield greater benefit
to executive function than a more passive exergame. Community
dwelling older adults, with a focus on those with sMCI, were
randomly assigned to: exer-tour (pedaling along a virtual bike
path), exer-score (pedaling to score points by navigating an
interactive videogame), or a game-only condition (the latter
having to be adapted due to issues with participant adherence,
resulting in a shorter and remunerated, quasi-experimental arm).
Fourteen older adults with sMCI were adherent to the
minimum assigned dose (average 3×/wk of exercise) for
6 months. Both conditions were found to yield significant
improvement on one of three measures of executive function
(Stroop A/C), producing similar moderate effect sizes at 6
months (d = 0.52 and 0.47, respectively). There was no
interaction effect; however, from informal examination of the
graph of the data (Figure 4), it appears that the exer-score
condition did not produce incremental gains at the mid-
point (3M), while the exer-tour condition did appear to yield
benefit sooner, although by 6 months the exer-score and exer-
tour gains were similar. It is hypothesized that since the
exer-score condition does require significant mental effort to
play, it may have taken longer for exer-score participants
(with sMCI) to master the interactive pedaling and game-
play. Thus, there may have been delay in triggering the
synergistic effects of the interactive exercise that would lead
to a neurobiological cascade of events ultimately linked to
any cognitive benefit. Furthermore, it may be different brain
networks are activated by various aspects of the interactive
physical and mental tasks in each condition, thus resulting in
differential enhancement of network functions; for example,
the effect on Stroop herein is consistent with activation of

the fronto-parietal network used in inhibition and switching
and the fact that the volume of the ACC as shown on MRI
imaging was enlarged proportionally to exercise dose further
lends support to the impact on that specific network (Grandjean
et al., 2012).
The differential relative impact of the two forms of interactive
physical and cognitive exercise, exer-tour and exer-score, was
apparent when comparing mid-point (3M) moderate effect with
small effect (d = 0.52 and 0.14, respectively), while the game-
only condition showed little impact (i.e., of cognitive training;
d = 0.13). By contrast, the pedal-only condition by 3M was
more consistent with the literature on the benefits of physical
exercise alone for cognition as it yielded a significant within-
group improvement (Colcombe and Kramer, 2003), although it
was a more modest effect (d = 0.35) than the exer-tour, which is
also consistent with past research in which the cybercycle effect
exceeded exercise alone (Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012). It may
be that the measures of executive function that were chosen were
not as sensitive to the particular impact of each of the conditions
as they could be; while Stroop A/C revealed an effect, Trails 2/1
and Digit Span B/F did not, perhaps because the components
of executive function were not particularly enhanced (e.g., task
switching and working memory, respectively). Future research,
could strategically select measures that might better detect
change in selective attention or inhibitory control which arguably
might be more affected by repeated use of the exer-score
condition in which one is chasing dragons while scanning the
horizon for additional opportunities and avoiding pitfalls, and
so forth (e.g., Flanker or Go/no-Go tasks might have greater
sensitivity to detect for specific and relevant changes in executive
function; Diamond, 2013).
Analysis of secondary outcomes from the present study
yielded promising indications that this type of exergaming

activity can yield cognitive gains in other realms of cognition11
(e.g., verbal memory) among individuals with sMCI (with exer-
tour outperforming exer-score). Moreover, these effects seem
to generalize beyond standardized tests of cognition, to self-
reported perceptions of everyday cognitive function and also
vigor12 (again, with exer-tour outperforming exer-score). The
latter finding may benefit from further probing, perhaps via
focused exit interview questions regarding possible reasons for
this curious finding. Perhaps the regular practice of a mentally
challenging videogame led participants in that condition to
subjectively feel less capable (even though by 6M the gains exer-
score made in executive function matched that of exer-tour). It is
also likely that there would be individual variability in response
to the gaming scenarios (e.g., prior research has found that one’s
trait competitiveness can interact with benefit from presumably
facilitative features of an exergame, such as the presence or
absence of an avatar (Snyder et al., 2012). Indeed in conduct of
this trial, anecdotally, it was noted that some individuals were
keenly enthused by and motivated to keep track of their score,
while others were lackadaisical in their approach to pedaling
around for exercise but without much care for scoring. Indeed,
research shows the salience to the individual of the storyboard of

a videogame, as well as other features may affect enjoyment or
persistence, and can facilitate or limit use (Wang and Goh, 2017);
all relevant issues to consider when designing and planning a
long-term clinical trial with a goal of ensuring a thorough dose,
via consistent adherence.
These findings of significant effects with both types of
exergaming: exer-tour (low mental challenge) and exer-score
(high mental challenge) on executive function and memory,
mirrors one of the few similar studies, by Eggenberger
et al. (2015), who reported similar trends when comparing
an interactive dance exergame, with dual-task walking (non-
interactive), and physical exercise alone. It is interesting to note
that effect sizes were larger in our study and thus reached
statistical significance, while the trial above had a much larger
sample, but the effects were smaller leading to marginal results,
despite having exergaming conditions that were in many ways
similar. Perhaps this was due to the fact that the sample
herein was sMCI, specifically, while the Eggenberger study
utilized normative older adults. It seems likely that general, MCI
participants have already begun some cognitive decline and so
they may have more room to grow, so to speak, or at least more
distance from the ceiling on cognitive tests to reveal change
when attempting to attenuate the anticipated downward slope
of cognitive decline, and thus the effect may be more readily
apparent. Future research could further evaluate the possibilities
by enrolling and comparing effects of both normative and MCI
participants, with care taken to avoid possible ceiling effects on
baseline assessments.
Finally, possible mechanisms linking exercise to enhanced
cognition via presumed improved brain health were explored
with promising findings from pilot data sampled from willing
participants. Biomarker changes (e.g., BDNF and exosomes) were
found to correspond to improvements in cognition and dose
of exercise, each consistent with prior research (e.g., BDNF has
been found to promote the differentiation of new neurons and
synapses, and therefore, has been proposed to be a mediator of
adult neuroplasticity; Huang and Reichardt, 2001; Leßmann and
Brigadski, 2009; Flöel et al., 2010; Park and Poo, 2013; Edelmann
et al., 2014). Furthermore, neuroimaging revealed promising
gains in key ROIs (e.g., DLPFC and ACC) that corresponded with
improvements in cognition and dose of exercise, again consistent
with reports in the literature (Burdette et al., 2010; Weinstein
et al., 2012; Chapman et al., 2013, 2016; Hayes et al., 2013; Ehlers
et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017). While we retain a cautious stance for
interpreting these findings given the limitations already noted,
we are heartened that changes found are largely consistent with
changes in gray matter volume that have been noted in other
studies of learning and physical training. Some of which have
reported statistically significant changes as early as 1–2 weeks
(e.g., Ceccarelli et al., 2009; Zatorre et al., 2012) and specifically
regarding training-induced changes in older adults before the
6-month time point (e.g., Boyke et al., 2008).
Strengths of this RCT include a study design crafted to clarify
whether cognitive benefit could be maximized with a more
challenging videogame component integrated with the physical
exercise. In contrast to the findings of the ACES-pilot study
(Barcelos et al., 2015), which found that after just three months

Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise Study for MCI
FIGURE 6 | Neuroimaging correlates with exercise and cognition13: MRI of ACC and DLPFC. Notes: Illustration of regions-of-interest (ROI): ACC (increased with

of exer-score resulted in greater cognitive benefit than the exer-
tour. The present findings suggest that for a more impaired MCI
population the benefit of exer-tour shows up by three months, but
it may be necessary for participants to stick with the interactive
exercise through a longer window, six months, in order to
master the challenges and reap the benefits of the enhanced
exercise experience. Additionally, this study design began to
tease apart the impact the of component parts of exergaming
(e.g., physical exercise only vs. mental exercise only), as well as
explore possible neurobiological mechanisms and neuroimaging
markers that tentatively shed light and nudge future research
regarding the ways in which the body and mind might interact
for neuroprotection or amelioration of cognitive decline. A
particular strength of this study is the use of alternate forms
and additional serial testing (via single bout and 3M evaluation)
13As noted above, both ACC and PFC were analyzed in order to replicate prior
research which reported each ROI correlated with outcomes (e.g., exercise dose or
cognition), but because of the overlap of these ROIs only one is shown here for
clarity.
that preceded the final 6-month evaluation such that practice
or learning effects should have largely “washed out” or likely
plateaued by that point (Beglinger et al., 2005), thus greater
confidence can be placed in the results as representing a genuine
effect.
A significant limitation of this study is the difficulty
participants experienced in engaging a new behavioral approach
to preventing or curbing cognitive decline. Attrition far exceeded
our expectations based on past pilots and standard rates noted
in the literature. The fact that this study focused on persons
with sMCI, who face more than the usual challenges in
starting a new exercise regimen, was likely a major contributing
factor. Additionally, the requirement set out initially by grant
reviewers and medical center IRBs that persons with MCI be
considered a vulnerable population and must exercise in a
limited environment with professional oversight (i.e., physical
therapy clinics) proved daunting as participants were unwilling
or unable to arrange transport 3–7×/wk to engage in regular
exercise. Obtaining approval to make the equipment more

wellness centers did help somewhat, but nevertheless, retention
remained a significant issue. The resultant small sample does
diminish statistical power, although despite this, effects were
sizeable enough to detect. Additionally, a small sample limits
our ability to ask nuanced questions of the dataset which the
study design would have facilitated if a larger sample had been
obtained. For example, it was an a priori goal to compare known
subtypes of MCI (i.e., amnestic vs. not) to see what, if any, impact
subtype of MCI might have had on participants’ abilities to learn
and engage the more challenging exer-score videogame. This will
have to wait for a future trial with a larger sample, perhaps by
recruiting, as was necessary herein, those yet undiagnosed, but
going beyond a screening tool, a future study could prospectively
build in the mechanisms for a complete clinical workup of MCI
as well. Nevertheless, much was learned regarding the needs of
MCI patients and families in the conduct of such a trial, and will
enhance future trial designs and interventions (see below). It will
remain challenging however, to balance ideals about statistical
power with the reality and importance of continuing to conduct
research with clinical samples.
Future research is needed to address limitations of this study
and improve retention and adherence to these types of behavioral
interventions which have promising findings despite the variety
of hindrances. For example, to try to address the challenges
of enrolling and retaining MCI participants, our lab has been
developing a more strategic and tailored in-home approach
to facilitate adoption of this type of long-term behavioral
intervention. We have developed a portable, adaptive, tablet-
based neuro-exergame14, Memory LaneTM, specifically designed
to target executive function by way of integrating specific mental
challenges presented via a relatively simple, in-home interactive
Physical and Cognitive Exercise System (iPACESTM15). While
still only available for research purposes, the design had limited
bulkiness of equipment and used budget components such
that a large clinical trial will remain feasible (for example, an
under-table pedaler paired with a budget tablet). Preliminary
results from single bout use of our prototype iPACESTM have
been promising (Anderson-Hanley et al., 2017), and we hope
these various studies will encourage others to identify, design,
and implement novel behavioral interventions to combat and
ameliorate cognitive decline. Indeed there are a number of other
open protocols currently recruiting to innovative behavioral
interventions (Legault et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2016); for example,
the Aerobic Exercise and Cognitive Training Trial (ACT) out of
the University of Minnesota is enrolling patients with MCI to
better understand the benefit of combined physical and mental
activities (NCT03313895), and the Multidomain Alzheimer
Prevention Trial (MAPT) combines physical and cognitive
exercise, while also layering a nutritional component that may
be able to further maximize any cognitive benefit derived (Vellas
14Neuro-exergaming (Anderson-Hanley et al., 2016, 2017), is an adaptation of

improved cognitive function
15iPACESTM 2013-present, patent pending No. 62/140,991; BSK Ref. No.:
416P1700A
et al., 2014). Some research teams have been pushing the envelope
on the possibilities given advancing technologies and have even
explored web-connected exergaming to facilitate participation
(Bamidis et al., 2011; Konstantinidis et al., 2017). The availability
of such innovative interventions through data-yielding clinical
trials is heartening to many individuals and families already
facing the challenges of cognitive decline.
Given the encroaching dementia epidemic, it behooves
researchers and society at large to continue to press for innovative
and effective solutions that aim to maximize cognitive benefits.
In this way we can hope to make meaningful contributions
to the important cause of slowing or preventing the onset of
cognitive decline. It is likely that a multi-factorial approach will
yield the greatest impact, but there is much work to be done
to clarify which components and intensities (e.g., of physical
and mental exercise, nutritional and/or social supports, etc.), to
meld and leverage for the best and most meaningful impact on
brain health so as to ensure sustained cognitive functions in
later life. Furthermore, it seems likely that there is a great deal
to learn about factors that predict response to any intervention,
including physical and mental exercise. It may be that certain
genetic factors, such as ApoE status may moderate the body’s
ability to spark a given neurobiological cascade and thus reap the
benefits of a given intervention such as interactive physical and
cognitive exercise (Raichlen and Alexander, 2014). The more we
learn about these underlying mechanisms and the nuanced effects
exposed by analyzing larger samples, the more effective we can
be in designing and tailoring interventions (Morrison-Bogorad
et al., 2007; Lieberman, 2009; Larson, 2010; Read and Shortell,
2011; Gerling and Mandryk, 2014; Barha et al., 2016) to do the
most good for the greatest number of people as fast as we can,
especially now that so many are faced with sliding into the long
suffering.
