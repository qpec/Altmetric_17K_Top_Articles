Abstract. Turns out I have been a major contributor to the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease over its 20-year history. As such,
I was invited to provide a review of my work over the years. What follows is a retrospective of how the Alzheimer-related
research of a Ph.D. (i.e., not an M.D.) transitioned from basic to clinical, and moved from bench to bedside and back again.
I have included some of the more humorous and poignant twists along the way that some older players may find familiar and
I hope might inspire some younger players to hang in there.
Keywords: Environmental toxins, methionine cycle, nutrition, oxidative damage, translational studies, traumatic brain injury
THE ROLE OF JAD
I have been privileged to witness the Journal of
Alzheimer’s Disease (JAD) morph over the last 20
years from a grass-roots “by the people” journal into
a, if not the, premier journal in which to publish and
to locate studies on all aspects of neuronal homeosta-
sis and perturbation related to dementia. As many
journals rise in prominence, and of necessity become
more selective in which manuscripts are accepted
for publication, the editorial board often takes on a
“stuffy/holier-than-thou” stance. This has not hap-
pened with JAD, which has remained a major forum
for all things Alzheimer’s disease (AD). I recall an
editor’s meeting where founder George Perry said,
when JAD’s impact factor approached 5, he was of
course pleased but did not want it to go higher than
that, since such an approach imposes selection of arti-
cles that will continue to increase the impact factor.
The flip side of that is the rejection of articles, regard-
less of quality, that will likely not be widely accepted
should they challenge accepted views.

JAD
allowed
novel
articles,
novel
small
approaches, reactionary and revolutionary ideas, and
articles not taking part in the endless “A� versus tau
as the singular cause of AD” battles. This was in no
small way due to the originator and editor, George
Perry, himself a wellspring of reactionary and
revolutionary ideas, and the late Mark Smith, who
advanced the then heretical hypothesis that increased
A� during neurodegeneration was an attempt at
neuroprotection due to antecedent problems such
as oxidative damage. Mark drew the outstanding
analogy of the damage caused by A� to that of
firemen arriving at one’s home: they may break
down doors, chop through walls, and flood the area,
but in doing do they just might put out the fire and
save the home [1]. I found and still find solace in
the line of reasoning that, should this hypothesis
be correct, what we witness by definition are only
the A� failures; if a satisfactory neuroprotective
response were indeed mounted by A�, no clinical
signs would manifest.
This is not to imply that articles early on in JAD’s
history were inferior, but rather that they sometimes
explored novel areas and consequently, were small in
size. “You gotta start somewhere,” seemed uniquely
permissible for a submission to JAD. Indeed, how can

one obtain mega-funding for an area with virtually
(or literally) no existing studies, however preliminary
they may be. This is analogous to the “experi-
ence needed” for employment, leaving an entry-level
applicant unable to gain any experience since he/she
cannot secure employment.
The ability to publish somewhat radical ideas gave
my colleagues and I the hand-hold needed to develop
and submit a proposal to the Alzheimer’s Association
in the 1990 s on the potential role of homocysteine
in dementia-related neurodegeneration. There were
and are a number of good nutrition-based journals.
However, JAD provided a unique forum for connec-
tion of nutrition with AD neuropathology. Among
the reviews of this unsuccessful proposal was the
criticism that “There is no evidence for a role for
homocysteine.” Notably, 3 years later, the reviews of
our second revision (i.e., 3rd attempt) of this proposal
included the statement that “Everyone knows that!”
We just made it. Without ongoing acceptance by JAD
during these times, my group might have abandoned
this line of research, which after nearly 20 years led to
successful phase II clinical studies, themselves pub-
lished in JAD. Tracking the papers that I have handled
as editor has shown me that this is not a unique story,
but rather a consistent role played by JAD in allowing
novel ideas, and young investigators, to flourish.
The “shareholder” approach of providing an author
a term as an Associate Editor was, at least to me
as a young faculty member, an important feeling
of camaraderie and spurred on word-of-mouth/email
solicitation of colleagues’ submissions. I find it
poignant that, due to number of publications, refer-
rals, and service as both Senior and Associate Editor,
I have an appointment as Associate Editor until 2037,
which is well into my 80s. I stand the mind-boggling
possibility of presenting AD while still and editor for
JAD, hence the title “While I still remember . . . ”
Here’s to another 20 years for JAD, more success-
ful than the first 20! And I hope I am aware.
TIMING IS EVERYTHING
My forays into neurodegeneration began in the
laboratory of Ralph Nixon at McLean Hospital.
My studies began with studying axon outgrowth in
cultured neuronal systems. However, the Nixon lab-
oratory also a number of ongoing AD-related studies,
and in short time, I would add an extra set or two of
cultures to my experiments where I would perturb one
or more developmental systems. It quickly became
apparent that while slight activation or inhibition of
kinase or protease systems stimulated normal devel-
opment, overactivation or severe inhibition of the
same systems promoted “AD-like” mislocalization
and hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins
including tau. I ended up with a dual approach for
most experiments, where untreated or mildly stim-
ulated control cultures would provide indications of
normal development, yet would also serve as controls
for hyperactivation of alternate cultures. My stud-
ies were consequently funded both by the National
Science Foundation for normal outgrowth and the
Alzheimer’s Association and the like for neurodegen-
erativestudies.Thisoverlappingapproachminimized
the need for cultures and I was able to remain pro-
ductive on limited resources.
We were busy manipulating a laundry list of
kinase and phosphatase pathways and monitoring
their impact on neurofilaments, MAP2, and tau,
and were unaware that among these were “the”
tau kinases, which turned out to be the none other
than the ubiquitous glycogen synthase kinase 3�
(GSK3�), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), and
pp44-45 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPk). We and
others also found that tau underwent sequential phos-
phorylation, and that the order of kinase action
was critical in generation of AD-like phosphoryla-
tion [2–4]. This “unique critical order” turned out
to be nothing more than priming of the consensus
sequences for the proline-directed GSK3� by non-
proline directed kinases such as protein kinase C
(PKC)—yet another common player in many cellu-
lar processes. Modest activation of GSK3�, cdk5,
or MAPk promoted axon outgrowth and segrega-
tion within axons of phospho-neurofilaments and
phospho-tau characteristic of normal development.
However, a bit more activation instead induced
accumulation of phospho-isoforms of both within
perikarya. During this time, we also noted that slight
inhibition of the calcium-activated protease calpain
promoted axonal outgrowth, but activation instead
generated classical “AD-like phosphorylation” [5–7].
Moreover, these kinase and protease systems were
intimately related in that the impact of calpain on
both normal developmental and neurodegenerative
was mediated by modulation of PKC activity [8],
which in turn modulated GSK3� activity, which in
turn modulated axonal transport, including that of
neurofilaments and tau.
Additional studies added timing as a factor. We
saw that simple withdrawal of serum from culture
medium promoted differentiation, leading us to carry
 T.B. Shea / While I Still Remember: 30 Years of Alzheimer’s Disease Research
1051
out a study showing that differentiation was a default
pathway held in check in neuroblasts pending devel-
opmental withdrawal from the mitotic cycle [9].
Secondary glial-derived growth factors that were then
essential for axonal outgrowth and nervous system
development promoted neurodegeneration if secreted
at the wrong time [10–13]. Similarly, while A�
was neurotoxic to established neuronal cultures, it
was actually beneficial to undifferentiated neurons
or those in the earliest stages of differentiation [14].
I remember thinking that tweaking the same systems
spelled life or death. These findings led us to embrace
the notion put forth later from others that subtle
alteration of “housekeeping” systems could spell the
difference between homeostasis and degeneration.
FROM CHEMICAL TO NATURAL
APPROACHES
In the mid 1990 s, I relocated my growing research
operationtoUMassLowell,whichprovidedanumber
of advantages. The most important of these was that
I met faculty who specialized in nutritional research,
who noted that some of the systems and pathways
I had been studying were amenable to nutritional
intervention. Based on this suggestion, I incorpo-
rated a few nutritional as well as pharmacological
compounds in our ongoing experiments. Using vita-
min E, which quenched oxidative damage but did
not alter kinase activity, we were able to discern that
not only did tau hyperphosphorylation not correlate
with neurodegeneration in cultured cortical neurons,
but moreover that, while A� increased oxidative
stress and phosphorylation of tau, neurodegeneration
induced by A� was due entirely to oxidative stress
[15, 16]. These observations sparked what would
be a 20+ year collaboration and eventually lead to
a vitamin/nutraceutical formulation effective against
multiple biochemical/histological biomarkers of AD
neuropathology in laboratory studies and effective
against cognitive and behavioral decline for individu-
als diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) in clinical studies. Recalling Mark Smith’s
hypothesis that increased A� may be a reaction to
neurotrauma rather than a cause, these results also
steered my focus upstream of A�.
A second major advantage of UMass Lowell was
that at the time (late 1990s), there was no per diem
charge for mice. I therefore had the opportunity
to maintain large colonies of multiple transgenic
mice, with multiple breeding pairs, therefore at
various ages. And the last major advantage of relo-
cating to UMass Lowell was what seemed like
an endless stream of graduate students to whom
“Alzheimer’s-related research” was more attractive
than other more basic research. Overlapping exper-
iments (where untreated controls tracked normal
neuronal development), inexpensive reagents (vita-
mins and nutraceuticals), unlimited mice, and many
eager graduate students allowed us to embark on a
series of studies of nutritional supplementation or
deprivation with normal and transgenic mouse lines.
Nutritional expert Eugene Rogers proposed exam-
ining the impact of one-carbon metabolism, errors
in which fostered accumulation of homocysteine.
I was completely ignorant of this pathway, also
known as the Methionine Cycle. His interests lay
in basic research. But new research pointed toward
homocysteine as a potent neurotoxin, and when
Eugene pointed out that a component of this cycle
(S-adenosyl methionine, or “SAMe”) was the major
methyl donor (including methylation of DNA),
I saw this as an excellent means to position nutrition
against genetics in AD neuropathology. We main-
tained cohorts of adult mice (9 months of age) lacking
murineApolipoproteinE(ApoE–/–)mice,alongwith
normal (ApoE+/+) on a standard mouse diet and that
diet lacking folate and vitamin E for one month [17].
We found overall oxidative damage to brain tissue,
more so than liver (as an index of systemic dam-
age) exclusively for ApoE–/– mice lacking folate and
vitamin E. Surprisingly, we also observed cognitive
impairment for ApoE–/– mice lacking these vitamins
[18]. Normal mice displayed no increase in oxidative
damage nor cognitive decline when deprived of folate
andvitaminE,andApoE–/–micedisplayednooxida-
tive damage nor cognitive decline when provided
folate and vitamin E. The power of these findings was
that a genetic predisposition for oxidative damage
to brain tissue and accompanying cognitive decline
could be overcome by simple supplementation.
We then further manipulated the methionine cycle.
In addition to folate and vitamin E, we supple-
mented additional cohorts of mice with precursors
and compounds that were part of the methionine
cycle such as B12, SAMe and N-acetylcysteine
(NAC), and Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) to pro-
tect mitochondria and maintain ATP levels. In doing
so, we increased glutathione production and low-
ered oxidative species in brain tissue. Notably, when
ApoE–/– mice were deprived of folate and vita-
min E, they displayed significantly higher levels
of glutathione, but still showed increased oxidative
 1052
T.B. Shea / While I Still Remember: 30 Years of Alzheimer’s Disease Research
damage. We initially thought that generation of
excess glutathione was a failed attempt to quench
oxidative species [19–21]. However, because of the
large number of cohorts on multiple diets, we had
ApoE–/– mice deprived of folate and vitamin E but
supplemented with SAMe. These mice displayed nor-
mal glutathione levels, yet reduced oxidative species.
We essentially stumbled upon the finding that SAMe
is an obligate cofactor for glutathione bioavailabil-
ity. Specifically, glutathione-S-transferase requires
SAMe for transient methylation of oxidative species
for subsequent reduction by glutathione [22, 23]. Fur-
ther study revealed that the expression and activity
of multiple additional genes of the methionine cycle
were altered [24]. Similar findings were observed
when we compared mice expressing human ApoE3
versus ApoE4 [25]. Interestingly, normal aged mice
(2–2.5 years old) displayed biochemical and cog-
nitive impairments similar to those of 9-month old
ApoE–/– mice [26], leading us to hypothesize that
a genetic deficiency in oxidative buffering capacity
could play out as “advanced aging.”
We also manipulated the methionine cycle in
neuronal culture studies, which revealed aberrant
calcium influx, by multiple pathways, to under-
lie multiple neurodegenerative events including
increased oxidative damage, glutamate toxicity,
apoptosis, and homocysteine generation, the latter of
whichpotentiatedalloftheabovephenomena[15,16,
27–31]. Impairment of the methionine cycle fostered
aberrant calcium influx by multiple methods, includ-
ing a reduction of methylation of channels as well
as overactivation of phosphorylation by decreased
methylation of phosphatases [32, 33].
We also cultured cortical neurons in petri dishes
containing multi-electrode arrays, which allowed us
to monitor synaptic signaling. Supplementation to
bolster the methionine cycle increased complex sig-
naling characteristic of healthy neurons, while folate
and vitamin E deprivation prompted disorganized
signaling [34].
In addition to the above more general effects, our
studies also demonstrated that bolstering the methio-
nine cycle was beneficial for many AD-specific
biomarkers,includingpreventionofPS-1overexpres-
sion by methylation of the gene, prevention of beta-
and gamma-secretase activity, reduction of overall
A� levels (including extracellular deposits) and toxi-
city, reduction of phosphorylated tau, maintenance of
acetylcholine levels, improvement of cognitive per-
formance and reduction of aggression. Notably, all
of the above effects were deleteriously affected by
impairment of the cycle by folate and vitamin E depri-
vation (see references in [35, 36]).
These studies collectively demonstrated that nutri-
tion was pivotal not only for general neuronal health,
but for modulation of multiple aspects of AD-like
neuropathology.
FROM THE BENCH TO THE CLINIC
Overall, we conducted >40 studies with supple-
mentation of cultures and various mouse models,
which lead to a combinatorial formulation contain-
ing ingredients that bolstered the methionine cycle
(Folate, B12, SAMe, NAC) along with vitamin E
as a first-line of antioxidant defense and ALCAR to
maintain ATP.
We
made
a
small,
open-label
foray
with
this “Nutraceutical Formulation” with community-
dwelling individuals diagnosed with mild to moder-
ate AD, relying on the expertise of Ruth Remington
from UMass Lowell’s Department of Nursing and Dr.
James Paskevitz of the Dementia Clinic at UMass
Memorial Medical Center (Worcester, MA) and
internal funding from UMass Lowell. Participants
demonstrated statistical improvement in cognitive
performance (Clock-Drawing test and Dementia
Rating scale), while caregivers reported statistical
improvement in mood/behavior (Neuropsychiatric
Inventory) and maintenance of daily function (Activ-
ities of Daily Living) during the 12-month trial.
Caregivers requested that the trial be extended. Insti-
tutional Review Board restrictions could not allow
continued cognitive testing without a new applica-
tion (since this required visitations and interaction
with participants). However, a rapid minor amend-
ment allowed us to continue to deliver the formulation
and for caregivers to continue their assessment Neu-
ropsychiatricInventoryandActivitiesofDailyLiving
assessments for an additional 16 months. Participants
maintained their performance throughout this exten-
sion, resulting in efficacy for a total of 2 years and 2
months [37].
A second 9-month study with nursing home
residents
diagnosed
with
moderate-severe
AD
demonstratedaslowingofdeclineincognitiveperfor-
mance and improvement in mood/behavior for those
receiving the formulation versus placebo [38].
We conducted a series of trials with community-
dwelling participants with no known or suspected
cognitive difficulties. Participants improved statis-
tically by 100% in short-term word recollection
 T.B. Shea / While I Still Remember: 30 Years of Alzheimer’s Disease Research
1053
(California Verbal Learning Test II) and by 20%
in executive function (Trails Test A & B) within
3 months. All participants were then provided with
the formulation under open-label conditions. Partici-
pants originally receiving placebo improved within
3 months to the same extent as those originally
receiving the formulation for 3 months, while those
originally receiving the formulation continued to
improve. We then removed the formulation from
all participants for 3 months, after which time they
had declined to their respective baseline perfor-
mance. Participants then resumed the formulation
for 3 months, after which they once again demon-
strated improvement to the same extent as after their
first 3 months of receiving the formulation. Based
on the extent of improvement within just 3 months,
we conducted an additional randomized trial with a
secondcohort,inwhichparticipantsreceivingthefor-
mulation improved statistically in executive function
within just 2 weeks, and those receiving the placebo
did not improve until crossed-ever to the formulation
for 2 weeks [39].
Based on these results, the formulation was
awarded a US patent and we were able to com-
pete successfully for funding from the national
Alzheimer’s Association for phase II studies. These
studies, all of which appeared in JAD, confirmed
cognitive and behavioral improvement for individ-
uals with AD and cognitive improvement for those
diagnosed with MCI versus those receiving placebo.
Participants originally randomized to placebo also
demonstrated improvement following cross-over to
the formulation [40–42]. Individuals diagnosed with
AD who had previously begun consuming the for-
mulation on their own requested enrollment in these
studies. They were allowed to do so under open-label
conditions, since randomization would inappropri-
ately force cessation of consumption by some of
these individuals. These participants sustained cog-
nitive and behavioral performance over the course
of 12 months, during which time historical placebos
(from other publications) and placebo cohorts from
our own studies had declined [43].
These studies demonstrated that nutritional inter-
vention can be effective for cognition, mood, and
function for individuals prior to cognitive decline,
individuals diagnosed with MCI, and for all stages
of AD.
Due to funding and personnel limitations as well as
the relative novelty of this nutraceutical formulation,
our studies were confined to cognitive and behav-
ioral performance. However, since laboratory studies
indicate that this formulation reduced multiple AD
hallmarks including maintenance of neurotransmit-
ters, reduction of intracellular A�, extracellular
A�-reactive plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau
[26, 44], it is possible that the formulation could have
a similar impact for individuals with AD. Also of
interest would be a prospective longitudinal study to
determine whether or not initiation of consumption of
this formulation could delay a diagnosis of AD. This
is a reasonable possibility since individuals without
cognitive difficulties and those with MCI demon-
strated improved cognitive performance for at least
12 months. In addition, some individuals in our phase
II studies that had been diagnosed with AD prior to
baseline improved to the extent that their scores were
consistent with normal performance rather than that
anticipated for individuals with AD.
Notably, the extent of improvement observed in
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory in both phase I and
phase II studies was statistically identical to that
observed for donepezil in another study [37]. We by
no means suggest that this formulation is a substitute
for any prescribed pharmacological agent, but rather
make this point to highlight that nutritional interven-
tion can have a significant impact. Since donepezil
is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which functions
by preserving existing acetylcholine levels, and lab-
oratory studies indicate that SAMe (a component of
our formulation) maintains acetylcholine production
[26], donepezil and this formulation may be more
effective in combination.
IT STARTED LONG AGO
Many studies support the notion that cognitive
decline has begun in individuals that will develop
AD years to decades before clinical manifestation.
If this is the case (and the data suggest it is), then at
least one of the mitigating factors must, by definition,
have occurred at the start of this antecedent inter-
val, and must have been sufficiently benign to remain
unnoticed and avoid triggering intervention. One
such example was co-treatment of cultured neurons
with homocysteine and A�, each at concentrations
(10 �M) that alone provoked no detectable deleteri-
ous effect, yet together invoked oxidative damage,
calcium perturbations, and hyperphosphorylation of
tau to a greater extent than observed with 20 �M of
either agent alone [45].
Along these lines, within the past few years
we have taken advantage of our MEA system to
 1054
T.B. Shea / While I Still Remember: 30 Years of Alzheimer’s Disease Research
monitor subtle changes in synaptic signaling, with
the rationale that any such changes could precede
overt cognitive impairment or neurodegenerative
hallmarks. Indeed, we observed reversible inhibition
of complex signaling with exogenously-applied low
concentrations of A� that did not invoke oxidative
damage or calcium perturbations characteristic of
higher concentrations [46]. We also observed that
subcytotoxic concentrations of iron and A� had an
additive suppression of complex signaling, and fur-
ther that this deleterious impact was alleviated by
concentrations of zinc that had no detectable impact
alone [47].
Such mild delay or suppression in synaptic activ-
ity may not be detected during everyday life or even
during a standard cognitive test, but may spell all
the difference during a critical time-dependent situa-
tion such as the rapid reaction and decision-making
required to avoid a traffic accident.
WHAT ARE SOME UPSTREAM EVENTS
CONTRIBUTING TO AD?
AD has an apparent multifactorial etiology encom-
passing nutritional, genetic, and environmental risk
factors, none of which is sufficient to account for
all cases [48, 49]. Convergence of these factors
may be required for clinical manifestation [50, 51].
Genetic predispositions may be latent pending age-
related decline in nutrition [52]. We have already
discussed our work with nutrition, and much of that
work included positioning of nutrition with/against
genetics, including examples of how supplementa-
tion can overcome the deleterious impact of alleles
that promote AD-like neurodegeneration. However,
the contribution of genetics is exceptionally com-
plex. While some alleles and mutations have been
clearly identified as causal/contributory, there is a
less obvious facet of genetics, which is what I like
to refer to as “permissive alleles.” We had a very pro-
tracted series of revisions for a particular “position
paper,” ultimately published in JAD, which advanced
the possibility that the E3 allele of ApoE was in a
sense a risk factor for AD [53]. The focus of this
fight was to underscore that a host of alleles of key
genes (including those yet to be recognized) may not
directly promote AD, but may be permissive in the
sense that they do not provide critical neuroprotection
afforded by other alleles.
To try and quantify the impact of environmen-
tal enrichment and social interaction, we resorted to
our mouse models. Following systems set in place
by others, we examined the impact of environmen-
tal enrichment versus nutritional supplementation in
mice by housing mice either individually or in groups
under “standard” (a 173 cm2 enclosure layered with
pine chip bedding) or “enriched” (a 388 cm2 enclo-
sure with chewable nesting material for burrowing
and plastic toys rotated weekly) environments, and
provided them with either a complete diet or a diet
lacking folate and vitamin E. Among all groups, mice
receiving the complete diet housed in the enriched
environment displayed superior performance in Y
maze navigation [54]. In a separate study, a combi-
nation of environmental enrichment and housing of
mice in groups of 3 provided an additive boost to
cognitive performance in normal adult mice, as com-
pared to mice maintained in a standard environment
and/or in isolation [55].
These findings collectively indicate that environ-
mental, social, and dietary enrichment can have a
positive impact on cognitive performance. We note
that so-called enriched environments are in fact not
at all enriched from the perspective of the laboratory
animal. Providing mice with a larger enclosure con-
taining a few novel objects for exploration and the
possibility of digging a nest actually only serves to
approximate a natural environment; a standard mouse
cage with no objects and a thin layer of standard
bedding is actually an extremely deprived environ-
ment, analogous to an individual living alone in a
bleak tiny apartment or room in a nursing home
and eating poorly. Housing mice in isolation is also
unnatural. We could therefore re-evaluate such stud-
ies from the “reverse” viewpoint of the impact of a
deprived environment, lack of social interaction, and
poor nutrition on cognitive decline, rather than what
may be the less accurate viewpoint of a so-called
enriched environment, social interaction, and nutri-
tional supplementation on cognitive improvement.
A different class of environmental factors includes
air quality/airborne contaminants. Airborne carbon
nanoparticles of the sort emitted by standard pho-
tocopiers impaired complex synaptic signaling in
cortical cultures and furthermore imparted an addi-
tive impact to that of A� at concentrations at which
neitheragentperturbedsignalingalone[56].Compar-
ison of the geographical distribution of individuals
with dementia or MCI as reported by the National
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center with ambient air
concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter
(PM) suggested that ozone but not PM was asso-
ciated with more rapid cognitive decline [57]. This
 T.B. Shea / While I Still Remember: 30 Years of Alzheimer’s Disease Research
1055
impact was confined to individuals with dementia or
MCI and was not detected for individuals displaying
normal cognitive performance. Individuals harbor-
ing one or more APOE4 alleles exhibited a faster
rate of cognitive decline. These findings suggest
that airborne contaminants are another environmental
component that may influence the onset or progres-
sion of cognitive decline during dementia.
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AS A RISK
FACTOR FOR AD
A growing body of evidence has linked traumatic
brain injury (TBI) to subsequent manifestation of AD
later in life [58]. TBI encompasses primary and sec-
ondary injury. Primary injury encompasses structural
damage characterized by the stretching, compression,
and tearing of blood vessels and tissue, the extent of
which is dependent upon the nature of impact and
which can damage neuronal tracts. Secondary injury
encompasses an often protracted cascade of biochem-
ical processes instigated by primary injury, resulting
in excitotoxicity, cellular energy deficits, inflamma-
tion,oxidativestress,andapoptosis.Secondaryinjury
can accumulate over time and may not be detected
for days to years following the primary injury (see
refs. in [59]). This is particularly troubling since so-
called mild TBI can occur during relatively benign
situations, including “heading” the ball during junior
high school soccer. Even during a violent event, TBI
can be elusive. For example, when a military vehicle
runs over an explosive device, the one individual who
bumps his/her head but receives no physical wound
while all other do may not report for an examination.
Secondary damage can therefore continue unchecked
and can actually surpass the long-term damage from
an overt head wound. A few years back, I stopped
short at an intersection as someone ran a red light, and
turned to watch the car speeding by. A jeep slammed
into me from behind and pushed my car some 10–15
feet ahead, and my forehead slammed into the steer-
ing wheel. Since I was hit from behind, the airbag
did not deploy, and since I had turned to watch the
first car, my shoulder strap did not prevent this. The
reason I include this is that I had absolutely no rec-
ollection of hitting my head, or even being pushed
forward. However, a bruise appeared on my forehead
that matched the shape of the steering wheel. How
often does TBI occur leaving us unaware?
Lifestyle may influence the consequences of sec-
ondary injury. Since lifestyle modifications can also
impact AD, such modifications may be critical to
reduce the incidence of development of AD follow-
ing TBI. In initial studies to examine this possibility
under controlled conditions, we induced a closed
head injury (CHI) as a model of TBI in normal mice
using a standardized weight drop device after which
mice were housed in isolation or in groups. Cogni-
tive performance as assayed by Y maze navigation
was impaired in mice housed in isolation but not in
groups 1–4 weeks post CHI. CHI increased oxida-
tive species in brain tissue from social and isolated
mice, and also increased excitotoxic signaling in hip-
pocampal slices from all mice; however, excitotoxic
signaling was exacerbated by isolation [59].
These findings support the hypothesis that social-
ization may attenuate secondary damage following
TBI. More specific AD biomarkers (A�, phospho-
tau) were unchanged, but we recognize that we
only examined these mice over a short interval
following CHI. Future studies will examine the
consequences of single and multiple CHI in nor-
mal and transgenic mice over several months in
mice maintained ± environmental, social, and dietary
enrichment under the conditions described above.
With particular regard to excitotoxic signaling,
neurons exposed to glutamate elaborate excitotoxic
signals that differ dramatically from those elabo-
rated by untreated control neurons. We recorded
the synaptic signals elaborated by neurons treated
with glutamate in our MEA system, and uti-
lized them to stimulate additional cortical cultures.
Notably, otherwise untreated neurons displayed aber-
rant, disorganized signaling when stimulated by a
digitized synaptic signal from glutamate-treated cul-
tures. This disorganized signaling strongly resembled
that resulting from direct treatment with glutamate
(unpublished observations). These findings suggest
that secondary damage can spread to distal regions

IS THERE A CURE?
After all of these decades of research by so many
groups, no true cure is in sight despite identification
of integral processes and “at-risk” genes. However,
as discussed above, while we cannot alter our geno-
type, we can influence our phenotype. Our studies
are part of the growing body of evidence that lifestyle
modifications can make a huge difference in the onset
and/or progression of cognitive decline. Like diabetes
or cardiovascular disease, which can be kept in check

by lifestyle modifications, lifestyle modifications can
allow an individual to delay or reduce the rate of cog-
nitive decline such that the tipping point that warrants
a diagnosis of AD is pushed out beyond his or her life-
time. This is, by all measures, a “functional cure” for
that individual.
