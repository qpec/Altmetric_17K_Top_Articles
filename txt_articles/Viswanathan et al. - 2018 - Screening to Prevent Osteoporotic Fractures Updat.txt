IMPORTANCE Osteoporotic fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVE To update the evidence on screening and treatment to prevent osteoporotic
fractures for the US Preventive Services Task Force.
DATA SOURCES PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries (November 1,
2009, through October 1, 2016) and surveillance of the literature (through March 23, 2018);
bibliographies from articles.
STUDY SELECTION Adults 40 years and older; screening cohorts without prevalent
low-trauma fractures or treatment cohorts with increased fracture risk; studies assessing
screening, bone measurement tests or clinical risk assessments, pharmacologic treatment.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual, independent review of titles/abstracts and full-text
articles; study quality rating; random-effects meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident fractures and related morbidity and mortality,
diagnostic and predictive accuracy, harms of screening or treatment.
RESULTS One hundred sixty-eight fair- or good-quality articles were included. One
randomized clinical trial (RCT) (n = 12 483) comparing screening with no screening reported
fewer hip fractures (2.6% vs 3.5%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.89]) but no other
statistically significant benefits or harms. The accuracy of bone measurement tests to identify
osteoporosis varied (area under the curve [AUC], 0.32-0.89). The pooled accuracy of clinical
risk assessments for identifying osteoporosis ranged from AUC of 0.65 to 0.76 in women and
from 0.76 to 0.80 in men; the accuracy for predicting fractures was similar. For women,
bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, raloxifene, and denosumab were associated with a
lower risk of vertebral fractures (9 trials [n = 23 690]; relative risks [RRs] from 0.32-0.64).
Bisphosphonates (8 RCTs [n = 16 438]; pooled RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76-0.92]) and
denosumab (1 RCT [n = 7868]; RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]) were associated with a lower
risk of nonvertebral fractures. Denosumab reduced the risk of hip fracture (1 RCT [n = 7868];
RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]), but bisphosphonates did not have a statistically significant
association (3 RCTs [n = 8988]; pooled RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.44-1.11]). Evidence was limited for
men: zoledronic acid reduced the risk of radiographic vertebral fractures (1 RCT [n = 1199];
RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.16-0.70]); no studies demonstrated reductions in clinical or hip fractures.
Bisphosphonates were not consistently associated with reported harms other than deep vein
thrombosis (raloxifene vs placebo; 3 RCTs [n = 5839]; RR, 2.14 [95% CI, 0.99-4.66]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In women, screening to prevent osteoporotic fractures may
reduce hip fractures, and treatment reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures;
there was not consistent evidence of treatment harms. The accuracy of bone measurement
tests or clinical risk assessments for identifying osteoporosis or predicting fractures varied
from very poor to good.

Methods
Scope of the Review
Detailed methods, calibration and reclassification out-
comes, evidence tables, sensitivity analyses, and contextual
information are available in the full evidence report at https://
www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document
/UpdateSummaryFinal/osteoporosis-screening1. The analytic
framework and key questions (KQs) that guided the review are
shown in Figure 1.
Data Sources and Searches
PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for
English-language articles published from November 1, 2009,
through October 1, 2016, with active surveillance through March
23, 2018. ClinicalTrials.gov, Drugs@FDA.gov, HSRProj, Cochrane
Clinical Trials Registry, and the World Health Organization Interna-
tional Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also searched. To
supplement systematic electronic searches (eMethods 1 in the
Supplement), studies included in relevant existing systematic
reviews1,8,9 and reference lists of pertinent articles, and studies
suggested by reviewers, were reviewed.
Study Selection
Twoinvestigatorsindependentlyreviewedtitles,abstracts,andfull-
textarticlesusingprespecifiedinclusioncriteriaforeachKQ(eTable
1 in the Supplement), with disagreements about inclusion resolved
bydiscussion.ForKQ1,KQ2,andKQ3(benefitsandharmsofscreen-
ing),studiesforwhichthemajorityofparticipantswerecommunity-
dwelling adults with no known low-trauma fractures or metabolic
bone disease were included. For KQ4 and KQ5 (benefits and harms
of treatment), studies were included if the majority of participants
had an increased fracture risk.
Eligible screening tests included bone tests (eg, DXA, quantita-
tive ultrasound) and clinical risk assessments for osteoporosis or
fracture risk if externally validated and publicly available. Eligible
treatments included US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–
approved pharmacotherapy (specifically, bisphosphonates, estro-
gen agonists/antagonists, estrogen- and/or progestin-based
hormone therapy, parathyroid hormone , and RANK ligand inhibi-
tors [eg, denosumab]). Eligible outcomes included diagnostic or
predictive accuracy (as measured by area under the curve [AUC]),
incident fractures, fracture-related morbidity or mortality, all-cause
mortality, and harms.
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews were
eligibleforallKQs;observationalstudydesignswerealsoeligiblefor
accuracy of screening (KQ2) and harms of screening and treatment
(KQ3 and KQ5). Only studies published in English and conducted in
countries categorized as “very high”by the 2015 Human Develop-
ment Index were included.10
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Foreachincludedstudy,1investigatorextractedinformationabout
design, population, intervention, and outcomes, and a second in-
vestigator reviewed for completeness and accuracy. Two indepen-
dent investigators assessed the quality of each study as good, fair,
or poor, using predefined criteria developed by the USPSTF
(eMethods 2 in the Supplement)7 and others for assessing the risk
of bias of diagnostic tests,11 prognostic tests,12 trials,13 observa-
tional studies,14 and systematic reviews.11,15 Individual study qual-
ity ratings are provided in eTables 2 through 59 in the Supplement.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Findings were qualitatively synthesized for each KQ in tabular and
narrative formats. Studies were included if they met all study selec-
tion criteria and were fair or good quality; this included studies from
the prior review that informed the USPSTF 2011 recommendation
that continued to meet the study selection criteria for this update.
When at least 3 independent and similar RCTs were available,16
random-effects models using the inverse-variance weighted
method of DerSimonian and Laird was used to estimate pooled
effects for pooled AUCs or relative risks.17 Statistical heterogeneity
was assessed using the I2 statistic.13 All quantitative analyses were
conducted using OpenMetaAnalyst or Comprehensive Meta
Analysis.18,19 The strength of evidence for each outcome was
assessed based on the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research
Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness
Reviews,20 which specifies the assessment of study limitations,
directness, consistency, precision, and reporting bias for each inter-
vention comparison and major outcome of interest.

Evidence reviews for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) use an
analytic framework to visually display the key questions that the review will
address to allow the USPSTF to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a
preventive service. The questions are depicted by linkages that relate to
interventions and outcomes. A dashed line is used to reflect the natural
progression of disease between an intermediate outcome and a health
outcome. Further details are available from the USPSTF procedure manual.7

report higher AUCs than instruments measuring fewer risks.
Thirty-five studies reported other measures of diagnostic ac-
curacy (ie, sensitivity, specificity), but the instrument score thresh-
old used to assess diagnostic accuracy varied considerably across
studies.eTable60intheSupplementpresentssensitivityandspeci-

Bone Measurement Tests
Seven studies in women and 3 studies in men compared calcaneal
quantitative ultrasound to centrally measured DXA for identifying
osteoporosis. Reported AUCs varied from 0.69 to 0.90 (eTable 61
intheSupplement).Forwomen,thepooledAUCestimatewas0.77
(95% CI, 0.72-0.81; I2 = 82.3%; 7 studies [1969 participants]; eFig-

0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.94; I2 = 98.2%; 3 studies [5142 partici-
pants]) (eFigure 9 in the Supplement). Similar findings were ob-
served for digital x-ray radiogrammetry, peripheral DXA, and radio-
graphic absorptiometry were observed.

ported specificities were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.74-0.75) for women and
0.86 (0.85-0.87) for men.
Bone Measurement Tests
Twenty-three studies evaluated the accuracy of various bone mea-
surementtestsforpredictingfracture(Table2).Ingeneral,nomean-
ingful differences in accuracy by type of bone test or by sex were
observed.AUCestimatesweregenerallyhigherforpredictionofhip
fracture than for prediction of fractures at other sites.
Key Question 2b. What is the evidence to determine screening in-
tervals for osteoporosis and low bone density?
Two studies included participants with widely varying base-
line BMD. Both suggest no advantage to repeated bone measure-
ment testing (at 8 years86 and 3.7 years87 apart) (eTable 62 in the
Supplement).87However,3studiesthatdevelopedprognosticmod-
els suggested that the optimal screening interval varies by baseline
BMD.88-90 Age and use of hormone replacement therapy also in-
fluence optimal screening intervals.88,89
Harms of Screening
Key Question 3. What are the harms of screening for osteoporotic
fracture risk?
One trial, SCOOP (previously described in KQ1),21 assessed the
effect of screening on anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and

a Studies summarized in this table include instruments predicting fracture risk over a specified time horizon
(eg, 5 or 10 years). Additional studies predicting fracture by a certain age are summarized in the narrative.
bUpdated pooled estimates are provided where possible; otherwise, range of AUC estimates from relevant
studies is provided.
c FRAX has been updated several times since its initial release. Studies included in this review do not consistently
report which version was used; thus, findings reflect various versions of FRAX released from the initial version
through the current version. Further, although FRAX predicts 10-year fracture risk, the range of actual follow-up
used by studies reporting accuracy of fracture risk prediction varied from 2 years to 10 years.
dBased on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the femoral neck with T-scores based on National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) reference values for women aged 20 to 29 years.
e Based on DXA, site unspecified, reference values for T-scores unspecified.
f Either BMD or body weight is used in the nomogram.
g This instrument can be used for prediction of either 5- or 10-year fracture risk.
h One study58 reported discrimination using Harrell C statistic.
i Risk factor only used in prediction of fracture for women.
j Risk factor not included in the original QFracture but present in the 2012 update to QFracture.
k Original instrument was validated for up to age 85 years; 2012 updated version included up to age 100 years.
l Two studies60,62 did not include fractures of the proximal humerus in their definition of MOF.
mBased on DXA of the proximal femur, reference values for T-scores unspecified.
n These instruments were initially developed to predict osteoporosis, not incident fracture. Studies have
evaluated their use for fracture prediction with length of follow-up over 3 years or over 10 years as indicated.
o Only 5 risk factors from the original FRISC model were used for this estimate: age, weight, prior fracture, lumbar
BMD, back pain.
pBased on DXA of the total hip and hip subregions, T-scores based on NHANES reference values for men.
qOriginally developed on a cohort of only women for 5-year risk prediction, with a smaller set of clinical risk
factors. Subsequent validation studies included added risk factors, included 10-year risk predictions, and applied
the model to a cohort of only men.

Nonvertebral Fractures

FDA-approved dose] [n = 151 men] or 40 μg [n = 139 men] com-
pared with placebo [n = 147 men]),109 although the results did not
reach statistical significance because of a small number of frac-
tures and early termination of the study for safety concerns (20 μg
vsplacebo:1.3%vs2.0%;RR,0.65[95%CI,0.11-3.83];40μgvspla-

(RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.92-1.04]; I2 = 0.0%; 17 RCTs [11 745 partici-
pants]) (eFigure 26 in the Supplement), or upper gastrointestinal
events(RR,1.01[95%CI,0.98-1.05];I2 = 0.0%;13RCTs[20 485par-
ticipants]) (eFigure 27 in the Supplement) for any individual bis-
phosphonate drug or overall as a class.

Raloxifene
Pooled estimates of women followed up from 1 to 4 years and ran-
domized to raloxifene or placebo found no significant association
between raloxifene use and discontinuation of treatment because
of adverse events (12.6% vs 11.2%; RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.98-1.28];
I2 = 0.0%; 6 RCTs [6438 participants]) (eFigure 28 in the Supple-

between raloxifene use and deep vein thromboses (0.7% vs 0.3%;

Discussion
Table 3 and Table 4 summarize the strength of evidence and find-
ings from this review. This updated review for the UPSPTF incorpo-
rates new evidence on the direct link between screening for osteo-
porosis and health outcomes. One trial (SCOOP) addressed the
morbidity, mortality, and harms associated with screening to pre-
vent osteoporotic fractures (KQ1, KQ3). The trial found evidence of
benefit for a secondary outcome only, the incidence of hip fractures
(low strength of evidence of benefit). For all other outcomes (osteo-
porosis-related fractures, clinical fractures, mortality, anxiety, qual-
ityoflife;insufficientstrengthofevidence),thetrialdidnotreportsta-
tistically significant differences in benefits or harms. The release of
guidelines during trial recruitment122 and observation123 may have
changedstandardsforusualcare;differencesbetweenstudygroups
may have been attenuated as a result. The use of the 10-year risk of
hipfractureratherthantheriskofmajorosteoporoticfractureasthe
thresholdforDXAtestingmayhaveincreasedthelikelihoodofeffec-
tivenessforpreventinghipratherthanotherfractures(giventhatrisks
ofhipandotherfracturesarecorrelatedbutnotidentical21).Thedis-
crepancyinresultsbetweenthehipfractureoutcomesandotherfrac-
tures points to the need for caution in interpreting the results.
Although results from studies of accuracy of bone measure-
menttestsorclinicalriskassessmentsforidentifyingosteoporosisor
predicting fractures vary, in general they report no more than mod-
erate accuracy (KQ2), and this evidence was graded as low to mod-
erate. On average, clinical risk assessment tools to identify osteopo-
rosisperformedbetterinmenthaninwomen.FRAXperformedonly
better than chance in younger women. Predictions of hip fractures
weremoreaccuratethanpredictionoffracturesatothersitesorcom-
positefractureoutcomes.Sixteenclinicalriskassessmenttoolsforthe
identificationofosteoporosiswerefound,andalthoughtheseinstru-
ments had many risk variables in common (eg, age, weight, hor-
mone therapy use), there was considerable heterogeneity in the pa-
tient populations studied and the anatomical sites used to measure
bone density. The evidence for clinical risk assessments varies in the
incorporation of BMD and number of risks. In general, tools incorpo-
rating BMD had higher accuracy than tools without BMD. The accu-
racy of tools with more clinical variables was similar to the accuracy
oftoolswithfewerriskfactors,suggestingthatfutureresearchcould
focusonsimplerinstrumentsthatcanbeeasilyincorporatedintoclini-
cal practice. Future study into the optimal thresholds to trigger fur-
ther diagnostic evaluation (eg, DXA testing) or to begin treatment is
alsocritical,becausevalidandreliablecutoffsforhighandlowriskcat-
egories are necessary for clinical decision making.
Pharmacotherapytreatmentstudiesinwomenshowthatmul-
tiple classes of medications (bisphosphonates, parathyroid hor-
mone, raloxifene, and denosumab) reduce the risk of vertebral and
nonvertebral fractures (KQ4); this evidence was graded as low to
moderate for reducing fractures. Two of 3 studies of bisphospho-
nates that reported hip fractures were not powered to detect ef-
fects on hip fractures; the pooled evidence did not demonstrate a
statistically significant benefit. Evidence for benefit in men is lim-
ited to 1 trial of a bisphosphonate, which demonstrated a large re-
duction in radiographic vertebral fractures. No studies demon-
stratedreductionsinriskofclinicalvertebralfracturesornonvertebral
fractures for men. No studies reporting on hip fractures, fracture-
related morbidity, or mortality were identified.
Althoughseveraltrialsreportedonharms(KQ5),theyvariedsub-
stantially in definitions used. No consistent evidence of harms with
bisphosphonates (strength of evidence graded as moderate) was
identified and no bisphosphonate trials reported rare harms, such
as osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femur fractures, or kidney fail-
ure. The evidence on harms in men was very limited but was con-
sistent with harms for women when available.

 Limitations
This review has several limitations. First, it focused on treatment
with prescription medications only; it does not address other
interventions that might reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures,
such as functional assessment, safety evaluations, vision exami-
nations, exercise or physical therapy, vitamin supplementation,
and diet interventions. Further, this review did not consider com-
parative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment.
Second, treatment studies included in this review relied
on BMD T-scores to enroll participants into trials. Risk factors
beyond bone density, such as microarchitectural deterioration
of bone tissue and decline in bone quality, contribute to os-
teoporotic fractures: therefore, approaches that rely on BMD
measurement wholly or in part may not be the most accurate
approaches for identifying patients at highest risk for osteopo-
rotic fractures.
Third, included studies on diagnosing osteoporosis or pre-
dicting fractures are heterogeneous with respect to prevalence
of baseline fractures, baseline BMD, prior treatment, and length
of study follow-up (which was sometimes shorter than the time
horizon of the risk prediction instrument); most meta-analyses
demonstrated high statistical heterogeneity (I2 > 80%), suggest-
ing that the variance can be explained by heterogeneity rather
than chance. Fourth, the evidence base is sparse on screening
interval, screening in men and premenopausal women, and long-
term studies on the harms of screening and treatment.
Conclusions
In women, screening to prevent osteoporotic fractures may
reduce hip fractures, and treatment reduced the risk of vertebral
and nonvertebral fractures; there was not consistent evidence of
treatment harms. The accuracy of bone measurement tests or
clinical risk assessments for identifying osteoporosis or predicting
fractures varied from very poor to good.
