Long-term Risk of Hospitalization for Somatic Diseases
in Survivors of Adolescent or Young Adult Cancer
Kathrine Rugbjerg, PhD; Jørgen H. Olsen, MD, DMSc
IMPORTANCE Survivors of adolescent and young adult cancers are at risk for
treatment-induced late adverse effects; however, to our knowledge, the long-term risk of
hospitalization in this specific group of cancer survivors has not been thoroughly evaluated.
OBJECTIVE To examine relative and absolute excess risk for hospitalizations up to 34 years
after diagnosis of adolescent and young adult cancer compared with population
comparisons.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a cohort study, conducted in Denmark, of
33 555 five-year survivors of adolescent or young adult cancer, diagnosed from
1943 through 2004, when they were 15 to 39 years of age, and 228 447 population
comparisons, matched to the survivors by sex and year of birth.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cancer survivors and comparisons were followed up for
hospitalizations in the Danish Patient Register through December 2010. Standardized
hospitalization rate ratios (RRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated.
RESULTS After a median follow-up of 14 years, we identified 53 032 hospitalizations in cancer
survivors, whereas 38 423 were expected, resulting in an overall RR of 1.38 (95% CI,
1.37-1.39). The data analysis was started in January 2015 and ended in June 2015. Additional
data analyses requested by the reviewers were conducted in August 2015. The highest risks
were found for the main diagnostic groups of diseases of blood and blood-forming organs
(RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.87-2.14), infectious and parasitic diseases (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.61-1.77),
and malignant neoplasms (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.59-1.68). The overall AER was 2803 (95% CI,
2712-2893) per 100 000 person-years; the highest AERs were found for malignant
neoplasms, diseases of digestive organs, and diseases of the circulatory system (18%, 15%,
and 14% of total AER, respectively). Survivors of the 10 most common cancers in adolescents
and young adults were at significantly increased risk for diseases in the 12 main diagnostic
groups. The highest risks were those of survivors of leukemia (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 2.02-2.42),
brain cancer (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.86-2.00), and Hodgkin lymphoma (RR, 1.87; 95% CI,
1.80-1.94).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The large number of survivors and the use of hospital
discharge diagnoses made it possible to draw a comprehensive picture of the complex
inpatient disease burden experienced by survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer. The
findings underscore a great diversity of cancer-related health problems that physicians and
patients should be knowledgeable about.

S
everal large studies have been published on the gen-
eral disease burden of survivors of childhood cancer1-6;
however, the disease pattern of survivors of adolescent
and young adult cancer is only incompletely described. Few
studies conducted have focused mainly on risks for specific
diseases7-10; only 1 Canadian study11 evaluated the risk for hos-
pitalization for several diseases. That study,11 which included
902 five-year survivors of cancer diagnosed at ages 20 to 24
years, found a significantly increased risk for hospitalization
of1.4relativetothatofamatchedcomparisongroup.Thesmall
sample size, however, prevented formation of any firm con-
clusion when estimating risks for survivors of specific cancer
types and for specific causes for hospitalization.11 Because
the pattern of cancers in adolescents and young adults dif-
fers from that in children and middle-aged adults12 and the
biology of adolescent and young adult cancers is suggested
to be distinct,13 research on the disease burden of this par-
ticular group of cancer survivors is important for planning
preventive initiatives.
In a nationwide cohort study with virtually no loss to
follow-up and exclusive use of medically verified diagnostic
information from individual inpatient records, we studied the
fullrangeofsomaticdiseasesrequiringhospitalizationin33 555
five-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when they were 15 to
39 years old.
Methods
Cancer Survivors and Comparison Cohort
The basic cohort comprised 53 482 patients with a first pri-
mary cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) diagnosed
whentheywere15 to 39yearsoldandaddedtotheDanishCan-
cerRegistryintheperiodJanuary1,1943,toDecember31,2009
(recruitmentperiod),andwhowerealiveonApril2,1968,when
the Danish civil registration system was started. The Danish
Cancer Registry is nationwide, and cancer diagnoses are re-
ported from several sources, ensuring virtually complete cov-
erage. Cancers were classified according to the International
Classification of Diseases, seventh revision (ICD-7) from 1943
to 1977; the ICD for Oncology (ICD-O) during 1978 to 2003; and
the ICD-10 thereafter.14 From the Cancer Registry, we ob-
tained information on type of cancer and date of diagnosis and
assigned individuals to the main diagnostic groups of ICD-7.
Since the start of the centralized civil registration in Den-
mark, all residents (5.5 million in 2009) have been assigned a
unique personal identification number that allows accurate
linkage between registers.15
To measure disease-specific hospitalization rates in the
general Danish population, we established a comparison co-
hort from the files of Danish civil registration system. For each
cancersurvivorwerandomlyselected5comparisonswhowere
matched to the survivor on sex and year of birth. Moreover,
the comparisons had to be alive and free of cancer on the date
of diagnosis of their respective survivor. Information about
vital status and migration was obtained from the civil regis-
tration system for both cancer survivors and the compari-
son cohort.
Before linking survivors and population comparisons to
the Danish Patient Register (see next subsection), we ex-
cluded those who had died or emigrated within 5 years of the
date of cancer diagnosis, or an equivalent lag for the compari-
sons, and those who had died or emigrated before the start of
the Danish Patient Register. These exclusions resulted in a co-
hort of 35 848 five-year survivors of adolescent or young adult
cancer and 237 875 in the comparison cohort.
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS soft-
ware (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc). The study was approved
by the Danish Data Protection Agency.
Hospital Admissions for Somatic Disease
The Danish National Patient Register holds information on all
nonpsychiatric hospital admissions in Denmark since January
1, 1977.16 Registration is mandatory, and diagnostic informa-
tion is submitted electronically by the treating physician. Each
admission to hospital initiates a medical record that includes
the personal identification number of the patient, dates of ad-
mission and discharge, a primary discharge diagnosis, and
supplementary diagnoses coded according to the ICD, eighth
revision (ICD-8), until 1993 and according to ICD-10 thereafter.
Data on cancer survivors and comparisons were linked to
the Patient Register, and a full hospital history with discharge
diagnoseswasestablishedforeachpersonwithaprevioushos-
pital contact. On the basis of information in the Patient Regis-
ter, we excluded cancer survivors and comparisons who had
ever been hospitalized for a congenital malformation or chro-
mosome abnormality (ICD-8 codes 740-759, ICD-10 codes
Q00−Q99) because we judged that these disorders might con-
found any causal association between cancer treatment and
chronic disorders. Thus, 33 555 five-year survivors of adoles-
cent or young adult cancer and 228 447 population compari-
sonswereleftfortheriskanalyses(eFigure1intheSupplement).
To characterize and quantify the inpatient disease
burden among study subjects in a comprehensible fashion we
At a Glance
•A comprehensive picture of the risk of hospitalization in
survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer is needed to
identify survivors at high risk for serious late adverse effects.
•In this cohort of 33 555 five-year survivors of adolescent and
young adult cancer, we observed an overall increased relative risk
for hospitalization of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.37-1.39) compared with
population comparisons.
•Highest relative risks were seen for diseases of blood and
blood-forming organs (standardized hospital rate ratio [RR],
2.00; 95% CI, 1.87-2.14), infectious and parasitic diseases (RR,
1.69; 95% CI, 1.61-1.77), and malignant neoplasms (RR, 1.63; 95%
CI, 1.59-1.68).
•At highest risk for hospitalizations were survivors of leukemia
(RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 2.02-2.42), brain cancer (RR, 1.93; 95% CI,
1.86-2.00), and Hodgkin lymphoma (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.80-1.94).
•Clinicians and patients should be knowledgeable about this
increased disease burden and preventive strategies should be
developed considering the complex disease pattern among
survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer.

grouped their hospital discharge diagnoses into 12 main diag-
nostic groups and the group of injuries and violence; these
groups were further categorized into 97 more specific disease
categories; see eTable 1 in the Supplement for the detailed list
of ICD-8 defined categories and the equivalent ICD-10 codes.
Because the Patient Register does not reliably distinguish re-
lapses from primary cancer, we used the Danish Cancer Reg-
istry for information on second primary cancers among
cancer survivors and first primary cancers among compari-
sons. Hospitalizations due to injuries and violence account-
ing for 1 main diagnostic group were analyzed separately and
not added to the total disease burden because these condi-
tions are primarily of external origin. We did not include the
ICD section on symptoms and ill-defined diseases in the pres-
ent analysis because these were regarded as too unspecific for
solid conclusions. (Mental disorders, child birth, and repro-
ductive difficulties require special considerations and will be
dealt with in separate publications.)
Statistical Analysis
Follow-up for hospitalizations started 5 years after the date of
cancer diagnosis for the survivors and on the corresponding
date for the comparisons, at the earliest on January 1, 1977,
when the Danish Patient Register was initiated. Follow-up
ended at date of death, date of emigration, or end of study on
December 31, 2010, which was the latest available update of
the Patient Register. Only the primary diagnosis (ie, the main
reason for hospitalization at each in-patient contact) was in-
cluded in the analyses because primary diagnoses are judged
to be more reliable than supplementary diagnoses. If partici-
pants had more than 1 hospital admission for a particular dis-
ease category, only the first medical record was retained. Risk
wasanalyzedforeachdiseasecategory,andthenumberofhos-
pitalizations for different disease categories was added up for
each of the 12 main diagnostic groups and the group of inju-
ries and violence. For each person, the sum yielded the total
number of different disease categories requiring hospitaliza-
tion. The observed numbers of first hospital admissions of sur-
vivors of adolescent or young adult cancer for a given disease
category were compared with expected numbers derived from
the appropriate sex-, age-, and calendar period–specific hos-
pitalization rates of the comparison cohort, and the standard-
ized hospitalization rate ratio (RR), observed-to-expected hos-
pital admissions for the defined disease categories) with
corresponding 95% CIs, was estimated. The absolute excess
risk (AER) (ie, the additional risk of survivors for hospitaliza-
tion) was derived as the difference between the observed and
expected first hospitalization rates for a particular disease cat-
egory per 100 000 person-years of follow-up. For a selected
set of cancers and main diagnostic groups we calculated the
cumulativeriskuntilage70yearswithdeathascompetingrisk.
To obtain an indication of the overall burden of disease,
we generated the distributions of cancer survivors and
comparisons for hospitalizations in 3 or more and 5 or more
disease categories during follow-up before the age of 60 years.
Furthermore, standardized bed day ratios (SBDRs) and corre-
sponding 95% CIs were calculated; in this analysis, all hospi-
talizations were included. Hospitalizations for new malig-
nant neoplasms were not included in the calculation of SBDRs
since the information on new malignant neoplasms were ob-
tained from the Danish Cancer Registry, which do not hold in-
formation on number of days at hospital. Expected bed day
rates were calculated on the basis of the hospitalization pat-
tern in the comparison group.
Results
We included 33 555 five-year survivors of adolescent or young
adult cancer (61% of whom were women) and 228 447 popu-
lation comparisons in our risk analysis. During follow-up,
10 488 cancer survivors (31%) and 41 012 comparisons (18%)
died. The survivors were followed in the Patient Register for
521 228 person-years (median follow-up, 14 years [range, 0-34
years]).Comparisonshadamedianfollow-upof18years(range,
0-34 years). Additional selected key characteristics of the ado-
lescent and young adult cancer survivor group are given in
eTable 2 in the Supplement.
The 33 555 cancer survivors had 53 032 first admissions
to hospital for 1 or more of the 97 disease categories listed in
eTable 1 in the Supplement, with 38 423 expected, yielding a
standardized hospitalization RR for a category-specific first
hospitalization of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.37-1.39), which was slightly
higher in men than in women (Table 1). The observed and ex-
pectedcategory-specificfirsthospitalizationratesof10 174and
7372 per 100 000 person-years, respectively, gave an AER of
2803 per 100 000 person-years (Table 1). Thus, for each ad-
ditional year of follow-up, approximately 3 of 100 survivors
ofadolescentoryoungadultcancerwerehospitalizedforanew
excess disease (ie, a disease attributable to the status as can-
cer survivor). Although the relative risk was significantly in-
creased in all groups of attained age, the increase diminished
with age, from a relative risk of 1.9 in the age group 20 to 29
years to 1.3 in the age group 70 to 79 years (Table 1; eFigure 2
in the Supplement). The AER did not vary similarly with at-
tained age, ranging between 2 and 4 category-specific excess
hospitalizations per 100 survivors for each year of follow-up,
with the lowest number in the age group 40 to 49 years
(Table 1).

forming organs, infectious and parasitic diseases, and malig-
nant neoplasms. In general, men had higher risks than wom-
en; in particular, the risk of men for benign neoplasms was
markedly higher (Figure 1) primarily owing to a substantially
increased relative risk for benign bladder papilloma in male
cancer survivors and a decreased relative risk for uterine leio-
myoma in female survivors. The latter is likely due to a higher
prevalence of hysterectomy among survivors of cervical can-
cer. Relative and absolute risk estimates for each of the 97
disease categories are listed in eTable 3 in the Supplement.

most common cancers in adolescents and young adults. The
overall 18% excess risk for malignant neoplasms was mainly
due to large excesses in survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular cancer, and breast cancer with
AERs of 1280, 711, 701, and 610 per 100 000 person-years, re-
spectively.
Figure 2 gives the relative risks for the total sum of cat-
egory-specific first hospitalizations in survivors of the 10 most
common cancers among adolescents and young adults. Sur-
vivors of leukemia (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 2.02-2.42), brain cancer
(RR,1.93;95%CI,1.86-2.00),andHodgkinlymphoma(RR,1.87;
95% CI, 1.80-1.94) were at highest risk for subsequent hospi-
talizations; however, survivors of all 10 cancer types were hos-
pitalized significantly above expected rates.
In a further analysis we calculated the relative risk for all
first hospitalizations for different disease categories belong-
ing to each of the 12 main diagnostic groups and for the group
of injuries and violence stratified by type of cancer; these risk
estimates are presented by main diagnostic group (eFigure 4
in the Supplement) and by type of cancer (eFigure 5 in the
Supplement). While the relative risks for the groups of endo-
crine diseases and other related diseases and diseases of the
nervoussystemandsenseorganswereparticularlyhighamong
survivors of brain cancer (RRs, 5.5 and 5.5, respectively), risks
for diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and respi-
ratory system were highly increased among survivors of leu-
kemia (RRs, 6.3 and 4.9, respectively). Also, relative risks for
infectious and parasitic diseases were notably high among sur-
vivors of leukemia and of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RRs, 6.3
and 3.5, respectively), while survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma
were affected by high risk for malignant neoplasms (RR, 3.7)
(eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Although survivors of cancers of the testis, thyroid, breast,
cervix, and ovary experienced increased risks for a broad range
of diseases, the extent of the increase was generally smaller.
In particular, the observed increased risks among survivors of
malignant melanoma were modest (Table 2).
Table 2 gives the overall risk estimates for hospitalizations
in survivors of the 10 most common cancer types, and for a
selected set of combinations of type of cancer and main diag-
nosticgroupsforwhichtheRRs,theAERs,orthenumberofdis-
ease outcomes were particularly high. Survivors of leukemia,
brain cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin
lymphoma were affected by highest AERs for subsequent hos-
pitalizations equivalent to 49% of the hospitalizations per
100 000 person-years among all survivors. Table 2 also shows
that the group of survivors of cancers of the cervix, testis, and
breast account for most hospitalizations number-wise, owing
toasubstantiallyhigherprevalenceofthesecancersinthepres-
ent cohort. In eTable 4 in the Supplement, the information of
Table 2 is further extended with the inclusion of pairs of can-
cer and specific disease categories worthy of note. This se-
lected set of combinations of cancer type and disease category
reveals a disproportionally large number of high-risk combina-
tions among survivors of leukemia, brain cancer, and Hodgkin
lymphoma (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

groups among survivors of leukemia, brain cancer, and Hodg-
kin lymphoma, respectively; combining the 2 main diagnos-
tic groups constitutes approximately half of the total AER for
these cancer survivors (Table 2).
Cancer survivors experienced more comorbid conditions
than comparisons; for example, 11.6% of cancer survivors
(3750) and 8.4% of the comparisons (18 523) were hospital-
ized for diseases in at least 3 disease categories at any time be-
fore the age of 60 years. Hospitalization for diseases in at least
5 disease categories was experienced by 3.3% of cancer sur-
vivors (1071) and 1.9% of comparisons (4104) during the same
age range. Also, cancer survivors spent more days in hospital
than comparisons; the SBDR was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.49-1.50), and
the corresponding absolute excess bed days were 40.6 per 100
cancersurvivorsperyear.ThehighestSBDRswerethoseofsur-
vivors of leukemia (SBDR, 2.7), brain cancer (SBDR, 2.7), and

most common cancers in adolescents and young adults and
for 11 main diagnostic groups (hospitalizations for malignant
neoplasms were not included) and for the group of injuries and
violence are shown in eFigure 7 in the Supplement.
Discussion
Most of the current follow-up guidelines for adolescents and
young adults are based on knowledge from studies on child-
hood cancer survivors.17 In the present report, we provide risk

estimates for hospitalization in cancer survivors diagnosed at
age 15 to 39 years, including survivors of types of cancers that
are uncommon or nonexistent in children. The 33 555 five-
yearsurvivorsofadolescentoryoungadultcancerhadanover-
all 38% increased risk for being hospitalized during follow-up
for 1 or more of the defined disease categories. The increased
risk persisted throughout life, with 2 to 4 excess disease-
specific first hospitalizations per 100 survivors each year (ie,
hospitalizations for diseases attributable to their status as can-
cer survivors).
It is clear that the highest overall risks for diseases requir-
ing treatment at hospital were seen in survivors of leukemia,
brain cancer, and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ie,
cancers often characterized by particularly intensive and
lengthy treatments).
Hospitalizations among survivors of leukemia were pre-
dominated by a broad spectrum of infectious diseases, which
is likely the result of the common use of intensive treatments
with agents possessing immunosuppressive properties. Hos-
pitalizations among brain cancer survivors were primarily due
to dysfunction of the neurological and endocrine systems in-
duced by surgical interventions and radiation treatments di-
rectedtowardthebrain,whereashospitalizationsamongHodg-
kin lymphoma survivors mostly were characterized by new
malignant neoplasms and heart diseases. However, survivors
of all the 10 most common cancers had significantly in-
creased risk of hospitalization when compared with that of
population comparisons.
Not only are the survivors affected by an increased risk for
chronic disease but they also experience more chronic comor-
bid conditions than the comparison cohort and spent, on av-
erage, 50% more days in hospitals. A Scottish study1 of hos-
pital admissions among 5-year survivors of cancers diagnosed
before age 25 years reports a SBDR of 3.7, which is markedly
higher than our finding; however, this is likely due to the
younger age composition of survivors at diagnosis and dur-
ing follow-up with lower hospitalization rates of the back-
ground population.
To our knowledge, only 1 previous study11 has assessed the
diseaseburdenofsurvivorsofadolescentandyoungadultcan-
cerfrominpatientdata.InthefilesoftheBritishColumbiaCan-
cer Registry, the authors11 identified 902 five-year survivors
of cancer diagnosed in people ages 20 to 24 years during
1980 to 1999, who were subsequently followed up for hospi-
talizations from health insurance inpatient data for an aver-
ageof6.1years.Seventeendiagnosticgroupsweredefinedfrom
ICD-9,andafirsthospitalizationforanydiseaseinagivengroup
was counted as a new disease in the analysis. The authors11 re-
ported a significant, 1.4-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.2-1.5) for
any hospitalization when compared with 10 times as many
matchedindividualswhowerefreeofcanceratbaseline.When
we restricted our analysis to survivors with cancer diagnosed
in the same age range and shortened follow-up accordingly,
weobservedarelativeriskforoverallhospitalizationof1.6(95%
CI, 1.5-1.6), somewhat higher than that observed in the Cana-
dian study11 (eFigure 8 in the Supplement). This is likely a con-
sequence of inclusion of a larger number of more specific dis-
ease categories in our study.
In a recent cross-sectional survey18 in the United States of
general health and quality of life among 8375 survivors of can-
cer diagnosed at ages 15 to 39 years and 334 759 cancer-free
controls in the same age range, 30% of the survivors and less
than 20% of controls in their 40s, 50s, and early 60s were re-
ported to be in poor general health.18 Another cross-sectional
survey in the United States of 4054 survivors of cancer diag-
nosed at ages 15 to 29 years of age and 345 592 cancer-free
respondents, with a median age at interview of 40 and 42
years, respectively, showed that survivors had a signifi-
cantly higher prevalence of chronic health conditions,
including cardiovascular disease (14% vs 7%), hypertension
(35% vs 29%), disability (36% vs 18%), and asthma (15% vs
8%).19 These increases in a broad range of self-reported
health problems are reasonably in line with the hospitaliza-
tion pattern seen in our study.
We observed a 1.6-fold increased risk for a new primary
cancer in the entire cancer survivor cohort. The highest
risks were those of survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, with a
relative risk of 3.7 (95% CI, 3.4-4.1). This is markedly lower
than the relative risk of 7.0 (95% CI, 5.9-8.3) reported in a
Dutch study20 of 1253 survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma diag-
nosed at ages up to 40 years. We were unable to explain this
difference.

The size of the present study, with 33 555 survivors of
adolescent and young adult cancer and 5 times as many indi-
viduals in the comparison cohort, made it possible not only
to measure the burden of hospitalization accurately but also
to assess comprehensively the extent and range of chronic
diseases experienced by this somatically disadvantaged sub-
group of the population. Moreover, the unique personal
identifiers and the early start of the inpatient register in 1977
ensured both random selection of a population comparison
cohort and virtually complete long-term follow-up for
chronic comorbidity. We used hospital-based diagnoses by
physicians as markers of disease outcome. While this
increased the validity of the diagnostic information, we
could not include less severe conditions and often more eas-
ily compensational conditions treated by the survivors’gen-
eral practitioners because no register data on such activities
are available. Accordingly, we acknowledge that the study
does not give the full picture of the survivors’disease bur-
den. Thus, the absolute level of the somatic disease burden
is underestimated to an unknown extent; however, because
this limitation also applies to the population comparisons,
the validity of the relative risk estimates is probably little
affected. The testing in this descriptive study of the indi-
vidual associations for statistical significance should not be
considered as hypothesis testing. Given the unusually large
number of estimate rate ratios and our practice of establish-

ing significance with 95% CIs, chance alone might result in
some false-positive findings.
TheusefulnessoftheDanishCancerRegistryforresearchon
late adverse effects in survivors of cancer is limited by insuffi-
cientinformationaboutcancertreatment.Thus,wewereunable
tospecifythefractionoftotaldiseaseburdenattributabledirectly
or indirectly to the various treatment modalities used. The pri-
mary aim of the present study, however, was to measure the
frequency and distribution of somatic diseases serious
enough to require hospitalization rather than to disentangle
the complex causal relations between specific treatments for
a defined type of cancer and late adverse effects.
Conclusions
Survivors of adolescent and young adult cancers face persis-
tent risks for a broad range of somatic diseases requiring hos-
pitalization. The morbidity pattern which—as described
herein—is highly dependent on the type of cancer being
treated, underscores the need for further implementation of
strict evidence-based sex-, age-, and cancer-specific follow-up
plans for survivors, thereby increasing the likelihood for early
detection and ultimately prevention of treatment-induced
morbidities.
