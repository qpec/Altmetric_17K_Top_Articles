Abstract
For several years, alarmist articles both in mass media and in the scientific community have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance, even
citing an inability to treat patients infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR) responsible for high mortality worldwide. In this review
we summarize and discuss the key points associated with the reality of (i) the existence of pandrug-resistant bacteria, (ii) the increase of
resistance worldwide, (iii) the link between resistance and death, and (iv) the need to develop new antibiotics. Data on antibiotic
resistance in Europe for the main bacteria associated with invasive infections apparently demonstrate that apart from Klebsiella
pneumoniae, which is resistant to carbapenems in three countries (Romania, Italy and Greece), the level of resistance to three or more
classes of antibiotics (defined as MDR phenotype) has remained low and stable over the last 5 years and that therapeutic options exist
both for reference antibiotics and for old antibiotics. The clinical outcome of patients infected by MDR bacteria remains controversial
and death rates attributable to MDR bacteria versus non-MDR bacteria are still debated. The arsenal of antibiotics currently available
(including ‘old antibiotics’) suffices for facing the waves of emergence of new bacterial resistance and should be considered as a World
Heritage. This heritage should be managed in a non-profit model with international regulatory approval.

Introduction
Over the last decade a new fear has appeared in the scientific
and medical community with the emergence and rapid spread
of antibiotic resistance [1–4]. For several years, alarmist articles
in both mass media and the scientific community have reported
an increase in antibiotic resistance, even citing an inability to
treat patients infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR)
responsible for high mortality in Europe and the USA [1]. This
has led to speculations about the end of the modern world
because of both a global increase in bacterial resistance and the
absence of discovery of new compounds to treat patients
infected by MDR bacteria. Moreover, several models to eval-
uate the economic and human cost of antibiotic resistance have
been proposed in Europe and in the USA [1], which have led
some to propose research priorities to control antibiotic
resistance. One main limiting factor for development of new
antibiotics and/or repositioning of old drugs is that private
pharmaceutical companies do not want to invest in this topic
because of the lack of benefits [3] and/or because drug com-
panies prefer to develop drugs for chronic diseases.
In this review we summarize and discuss the key points
associated with the reality of (i) the existence of pandrug-
resistant bacteria, (ii) the increase of resistance worldwide,
(iii) the link between resistance and death, and, (iv) the need to
develop new antibiotics.

 Source of Antibiotics
The Golden Age of antibiotics began in 1928 when Sir Alex-
ander Fleming discovered penicillin. Antibiotics were first
introduced into clinical practice in the 1930s. The majority of
the modern classes of antibiotics were discovered between
1940 and 1980 by screening the antimicrobial activity of mi-
croorganisms cultured from soil only. Most antimicrobials are
secondary metabolites produced by bacteria (Actinobacteria,
Firmicutes and Proteobacteria) and fungi (Penicillium, Cepha-
losporium and Aspergillus). These are inexhaustible sources of
natural products for the future (bacteriocins, non-ribosomal
peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase secondary metab-
olites). These enzyme complexes (polyketide synthases and
non-ribosomal peptide synthetases) are thiotemplate modular
systems that are genetically organized in modules with large
genes (>10 kb) [5]. Each module contains specific enzyme ac-
tivity for adding particular amino acids that represents a natural
way of synthesizing secondary metabolites [5]. These secondary
metabolites have biological activities and unique pharmacolog-
ical properties including antimicrobial activities. Significant ge-
netic diversity exists among these genes. By identifying the
repertoire involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabo-
lites, we will be able to model complex assembly steps and
changes in metabolites during their biocatalysis. Analysis of
bacterial genomes has shown a wide distribution of genes
encoding non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide
synthase in many phyla, most of them being encoded by silent
bacterial operons [5,6]. Consequently, the number of thio-
template modular system clusters without an associated known
natural metabolite far outweighs the number of possible
chemical structures [5]. The top–down approach of whole
genome sequencing has provided plenty of gene sequences
related to thiotemplate modular systems but relatively modest
chemical and antimicrobial activity information. Over the last
50 years, only one new class of antibiotic that is used in clinical
practice has been discovered: the narrow-spectrum daptomy-
cin, used in clinical practice [7]. Discovering new classes of
antibiotics from soil stopped in the 1970s, because most of the
bacterial species from these external environments were
impossible to culture. Approximately 99% of all species in
external environments and in the human gut do not grow under
standard laboratory conditions and are a promising source of
new natural products [7,8]. Although the majority of antimi-
crobials have been discovered so far from environmental iso-
lates,
natural
antimicrobial
agents
synthesized
by
microorganisms from the microbiome of mammals have not
been explored exhaustively. Growing bacteria that have not
previously been cultured is obviously an alternative way of
discovering new compounds [9].
Source of Antibiotic Resistance
Antibiotic resistance was identified for nearly all antibiotics
quickly after they were introduced into clinical practice but
throughout the 1980s, many new antibiotics were introduced in
the market. This solved the resistance problem until interest in
development of new drugs by pharmaceutical companies
decreased. The main source of antibiotic resistance de-
terminants are the microorganisms themselves, fighting and
surviving within competitive environments [10]. Microorgan-
isms living in human digestive tracts are in extremely harsh
competition with 300 to 500 different species of bacteria,
archaea and fungi, with microbial concentrations ranging from
104 to 1012 from the duodenum to the colon. Moreover, long
before the colonization of humans, these bacteria or their an-
cestors had to live in a world of competition that naturally led
them to develop many antimicrobial compounds to survive
[11]. Notably, the antibiotics currently used in human medicine
are weapons used in this microbial battle. The first antibiotic
resistance mechanisms were discovered following the emer-
gence of resistant bacteria pathogenic to man. It took us a long
time to believe that the appearance of these resistance phe-
nomena was a direct consequence of the massive (and some-
times inappropriate) use of antibiotics in therapy. However,
recent studies have shown that antibiotic resistance is an old
phenomenon, from well before the use of antibiotics. In 2011, a
research team from McMaster University (Canada) discovered
different antibiotic resistance genes in permafrost sediments in
the Yukon Territory (Canada) dating back over 30 000 years.
Researchers have found an ancestral operon encoding for
vancomycin resistance [11]. In 2012, the same team published
similar results from 4 million-year-old samples taken from a
cave in New Mexico (USA), particularly with the discovery of
bacteria possessing genes that confer resistance to daptomycin
or tigecycline, two very recent antibiotics used in human
medicine [12]. Many antibiotic resistance genes (to antibiotics
such as ampicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,
streptomycin
and
chloramphenicol)
were
also
found
in
asymptomatic human carriers in remote areas of the Amazon,
where exposure to antibiotics is extremely low [10]. Meta-
genomic studies of soil, water [5–7] and also in the digestive
microbiota of healthy men [8], gulls and broilers [9], have
identified resistance genes that had never been described, and
some of which are genetically distant from known genes.
Therefore in the environment, in animals and in humans,

 naturally resistant bacteria that constitute a reservoir of resis-
tance genes exist.
The emergence of resistant pathogenic bacteria observed for
30 years in fact is the result of a recent mobilization of resis-
tance genes from these pre-existing reservoirs. Under antibi-
otic selective pressure, resistant bacteria present within a
community will be able to transfer the determinants conferring
a selective advantage to other bacteria. We now believe that
the emergence of worrying ‘super bugs’ is a consequence of the
extreme plasticity of bacterial genomes. The number of anti-
biotic resistance genes identified in bacteria is only a small part
of the existing directory in nature. We believe now that there
are over 20 000 antibiotic resistance genes [12]. Consequently,
the emergence and rapid spread of antibiotic resistance in the
world can be explained not only by the increase in modern use
of antibiotics in humans, but by a complex interaction in a
microbial ecosystem comprising antibiotics and antibiotic
resistance genes. This leads to a new paradigm: antibiotic
resistance must henceforth be regarded as the existence of
genes and/or gene sequences found in nature that can be
mobilized at any time to spread in the bacterial community and
transmitted to bacterial pathogens. However, the success of
selection of such genes under selection pressure is unpredict-
able because our understanding of the origins and diffusion of
antibiotic resistance in the microbial community remains low.
Therefore, the emergence of new types of antibiotic resis-
tance and their distribution cannot be predicted because our
understanding of how they are created, develop and are
disseminated remains limited to date. For example, the NDM-1
gene was found to be a chimeric gene resulting from the fusion
of a progenitor type metallo-β-lactamase gene with a partial
sequence of a gene conferring resistance to aminoglycosides,
probably created de novo in Acinetobacter baumannii [13]. It is
therefore necessary to study the various reservoirs of resis-
tance genes to discover new emerging resistance genes that
could spread in the bacterial community in the future.
Is Antibiotic-Resistant Phenotype Stable?
There is a complex ecological interaction between the acqui-
sition of antibiotic resistance and bacteria virulence and fitness
that led to non-cumulative resistance in bacteria [14]. In fact, as
many antibiotics target critical bacterial functions (e.g. cell wall
synthesis, transcription, translation), it is assumed that resistant
bacteria suffer from decreased fitness, i.e. slower bacterial
growth and virulence [14]. However, compensatory mutations
may contribute to enhanced fitness for resistant-bacteria [14].
Hence it is known that depending on the fitness cost of resis-
tance, reversion of resistance could be achieved if selective
pressure were absent with replacement of the resistant popu-
lation by susceptible population [14]. Finally, resistant bacteria
may also have reduced virulence as exemplified by a ‘pandrug’
colistin-resistant A. baumannii clinical isolate in a patient who
received colistin therapy without clinical signs of infection [15].
This isolate had impaired virulence and fitness demonstrated in
a rat model of pneumonia [16]. Clinical studies in hospitals to
test the reversal of resistance in individuals in the absence of
antibiotics have shown that decreasing antibiotic use may cause
rapid changes in resistance frequency [14]. However, the rate
of reversion by susceptible bacteria after removal of antibiotic
pressure could be low and complex and depends on several
factors including the individual, the bacterial species and the
mechanism of resistance itself. Moreover, for some antibiotics
such as chloramphenicol, for which use has declined in many
countries in the world, resistance to this antibiotic remains
stable over time [17]. At the community level, studies on na-
tional interventions to reduce antibiotic use have provided
conflicting results regarding the change in the incidence of
antibiotic resistance. In one interesting study in Iceland, it was
shown that decreased use of antibiotics in children was fol-
lowed within a few years by a decrease in penicillin-resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae [18]. However, it has been demon-
strated that decreased antibiotic resistance was due to
replacement of the resistant bacterial population by susceptible
clones that were unrelated to the reduction of antibiotic use
[19]. These results indicate that factors other than antibiotic
resistance acquisition may favour the selection of particular
successful clones and that these factors are the main drivers to
determine the success or failure of such clones after resistance
is acquired. Hence, because emergence of a successful sus-
ceptible clone in the community is unpredictable, the modelled
trajectories of probable overall increase in resistance to anti-
biotics are highly speculative.
Do We Really Observe Increased Antibiotic
Resistance?
Most of the data on antibiotic resistance are provided by sur-
veillance networks, such as EARS-NET in Europe (http://ecdc.
europa.eu/en/activities/surveillance/EARS-Net/Pages/index.
aspx). The data collected in this network represent an overview
and a compilation of data from laboratories and hospitals in 30
European countries and are based on antibiotic resistance data
only from invasive isolates. Although there is a trend to increased
resistance
to
third-generation
cephalosporins
in
Enter-
obacteriaceae, mainly in K. pneumoniae, resistance to methicillin in
Staphylococcus aureus has dramatically decreased over the last

 10 years worldwide without any definitive explanation [20,21]
(Fig. 1). We also observe a very low level of resistance in
enterococci in Marseille, France [22]. These results re-emphasize
the fact that trajectories of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are un-
predictable, probably because of the cyclic success of some bugs
that tend to replace others, including MDR clones. As a conse-
quence of the non-cumulative effect of antibiotic resistance and
fitness cost for bacteria, the resistance rates to the main refer-
ence antibiotic in our hospitals in Marseille, France, have fallen or
slightly increased for the more common pathogenic bacteria over
the past 15 years (Table 1). Moreover, the rate of resistance to
carbapenems in Escherichia coli remains low and is not worrying in
our community (Table 1) or in Europe overall [23]. The per-
centage of E. coli invasive isolates with combined resistance to four
classes of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones + aminopenicillins + third-
generation cephalosporins + aminoglycosides) in Europe is only
4.6% in 2013 and has been stable since 2010 (4.3%) [23]. The real
burden of MDR bacteria is seen for A. baumannii and
K. pneumoniae in the hospital settings responsible for nosocomial
infections or for imported carbapenemase-producing bacteria.
However, in Europe, the mean percentage of K. pneumoniae
invasive isolates resistant to carbapenems in 2013 was 8.3%. It was
also <6% for 27 countries and very high and endemic in only three
countries: Romania (20.5%), Italy (34.3%) and Greece (59.4%)
[23]. Again for K. pneumoniae, the percentage of invasive isolates

 [23]. Finally, combined resistance to three or more classes of
reference antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa has slightly
decreased in Europe (13.0% in 2013 versus 13.8% in 2010) [23]. In
conclusion, data on antibiotic resistance in Europe for the main
bacteria associated with invasive infections probably demonstrate
that apart from K. pneumoniae, which is resistant to carbapenems
in three countries (Romania, Italy and Greece), the level of
resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics (defined as MDR
phenotype) has remained low and stable over the last 5 years and
that therapeutic options exist for reference antibiotics that are
not analysed in the EARS-Net annual report 2013. Similarly, the
percentage of combined resistance for E. coli and K. pneumoniae to
three or more classes of antibiotics in our hospitals is very low
(Tables 2 and 3).
Is There a Link Between MDR Bacteria and
Death?
Whether death rates attributable to MDR bacteria are higher
than non-MDR bacteria remains debatable, a recent meta-
analysis on deaths attributable to carbapenem-resistant Enter-
obacteriaceae infections based on analysis of nine studies
probably suggests that the number of deaths was significantly
higher in patients with carbapenem-resistant infections in seven
studies [24]. However, in this meta-analysis it was shown that
patients infected with carbapenem-resistant bacteria were
more likely to receive inappropriate empirical therapy and that
attributability of death rates to antibiotic resistance does not
take into account other confounding factors such as individual
susceptibility, concurrent co-morbidities, or virulence charac-
teristics of the isolates. In fact, along with septic shock and
severe infections, underlying diseases and severity scores are
the most common predictors of mortality in most studies [25],
not antibiotic resistance [26]. To address this question at a local
level we have retrospectively analysed mortality in southeast
France in 2011 and in 2014 for susceptible and resistant bac-
terial species and found that the number of deaths due to
resistant bacteria for a given species was lower than the
number of deaths due to susceptible bacteria (Table 4).
Do We Really Need New Antibiotics? The
Revival of Old Antibiotics and Patrimonial
Management of Existing Compounds
In parallel, since 2001 in Marseille, France, no case of thera-
peutic impasse has been registered, that is to say no case of
infection where the microorganism in question was pan-
resistant. The only MDR bacteria that has emerged recently
in
that
same
Provence-Alpes-Côte
d’Azur
region
is
K. pneumoniae, especially strains of this species that produce
carbapenemases that make them resistant to the β-lactam
family. These bacteria, which are also resistant to other families
of antibiotics, have been responsible for an epidemic in several
facilities in the area since 2014. However, by testing the sus-
ceptibility of 41 strains producing carbapenemases to a panel of
antibiotics, we have shown that none of these bacteria was pan-
resistant [27]. This study was especially based on the use of old

 antibiotic molecules that current studies and analyses tend to
neglect. These ‘old’ antibiotics, whose clinical efficacy is not in
question, can treat infections for which the latest antibiotics,
which are over-consumed, are not active enough [28]. These
‘old’ antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, clindamycin, clofa-
zimine, colistin, cotrimoxazole, fosfomycin and minocycline,
have proven very effective in the treatment of ‘multi-resistant’
bacterial infections [28]. However, it should be noted that
those old antibiotics such as colistin are usually less effective
when used in monotherapy and should be given in combination
therapy to obtain a synergistic effect [29,30]. Similarly, Brouqui
et al. were able, through the use of a combination of leprosy
antibiotics (sulfadiazine, minocycline and clofazimine), to suc-
cessfully treat a patient infected with a strain of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis known as ‘multidrug-resistant’ [31]. This suggests
that such old drugs may be useful in these cases and should be
further investigated. The only problem with these ‘old’ antibi-
otics is their availability, since an international study in 2012
found that among a panel of 33 ‘essential’ antibiotics, including
older
antibiotics,

aAnalyses performed on R (Auckland, New-Zealand) using two-sided Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact tests as appropriate, p <0.05. Each p-value was obtained comparing the number of deaths due to the infection by a susceptible strain and the
number of deaths due to the infection by a resistant strain in 2011 to that of 2014.

 industrialized countries [32]. Hence many potentially useful and
safe antibiotics are no longer available in many countries
because they are usually low cost and marketed as generics.
Antibiotic development is no longer considered to be a wise
economic investment for pharmaceutical companies [3]. Finally,
we believe that susceptibility testing on these old antibiotics
should be harmonized and integrated in routine practice when
necessary, and that resistance rates should be added to sur-
veillance programmes as already implemented in our institution
[33].
Conclusion and Perspectives
Incomplete information circulates about antibiotic resistance
and the end of the modern world in the media and the scientific
community, including true rates of resistance and links with
deaths. The arsenal of antibiotics currently available is enough
to face the waves of emergence of new resistance in bacteria
and should be considered as a World Heritage. This heritage
should be managed in a non-profit model with international
regulatory approval from bodies such as the European Medical
Agency and Food and Drug Administration. Finally we believe
that non-inferiority clinical trials are unethical and require large
sample populations that do not really exist in the case of
countries with a low incidence of MDR bacterial infections.
However, clinical trials comparing old and new antibiotics in
countries with high prevalence of MDR bacterial infections are
warranted.
