When less may be more: calorie restriction
and response to cancer therapy
Ciara H. O’Flanagan1, Laura A. Smith1, Shannon B. McDonell1 and Stephen D. Hursting1,2,3,4*
Abstract
Calorie restriction (CR) extends lifespan and has been shown to reduce age-related diseases including cancer,
diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases in experimental models. Recent translational studies
have tested the potential of CR or CR mimetics as adjuvant therapies to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and novel immunotherapies. Chronic CR is challenging to employ in cancer patients, and
therefore intermittent fasting, CR mimetic drugs, or alternative diets (such as a ketogenic diet), may be more
suitable. Intermittent fasting has been shown to enhance treatment with both chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
CR and fasting elicit different responses in normal and cancer cells, and reduce certain side effects of cytotoxic
therapy. Findings from preclinical studies of CR mimetic drugs and other dietary interventions, such as the
ketogenic diet, are promising for improving the efficacy of anticancer therapies and reducing the side effects of
cytotoxic treatments. Current and future clinical studies will inform on which cancers, and at which stage of the
cancer process, CR, fasting, or CR mimetic regimens will prove most effective.

Background
Calorie restriction (CR) and cancer
CR, a chronic reduction of dietary energy intake by
approximately 30% without incurrence of malnutrition, is
a broadly effective dietary intervention that significantly
decreases adiposity and inflammation and improves meta-
bolic profiles in non-obese humans and rodents [1–4].
Preclinical studies in mammalian models demonstrate
that CR extends lifespan, ameliorates risk factors, and de-
lays onset of age-related diseases, including cancer, type II
diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative dis-
eases [4]. In response to decreased caloric intake, meta-
bolic alterations foster health promoting characteristics,
including increased insulin sensitivity and decreased blood
glucose, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and angio-
genesis [4]. While the impact of CR on age-related path-
ologies has been studied most extensively in rodent
models, data from human observational and randomized
clinical trials demonstrate that CR in non-obese humans
results in metabolic and molecular changes similar to
those observed in rodent models [5]. Within the scope of
cancer research, a meta-analysis of preclinical rodent
models evaluated the impact of CR across multiple cancer
types and through a variety of tumor models [6]; overall,
CR displayed a 75.5% reduction in tumor incidence.
Longitudinal studies at the National Institute of Ageing
and the University of Wisconsin showed a significant
reduction in the incidence of cancers in rhesus monkeys
fed a CR diet compared to a control diet [7]. While the
antitumorigenic effects of CR are well established, the
mechanism behind this relationship remains unclear,
though it is believed that the tumor suppressive effects are
mediated, in part, by enhanced apoptosis within tumors,
modulation of systemic signals such as insulin-like growth
factor (IGF)-1, insulin, metabolic and inflammatory path-
ways, as well as by reduced angiogenesis.
Exposure to
an energy restricted diet
results in
reduced systemic glucose and growth factors such as
IGF-1 [1, 8, 9]. Preclinical studies in breast, pancreatic,
and colon cancer have demonstrated that modulation of
IGF-1 signaling plays a major role in CR’s anticancer

 effects [8, 10, 11]. In alignment with this, population
studies have demonstrated that the IGF-1 signaling
pathway plays a significant role in the development and
progression of many cancer types [12]. IGF-1 is a
nutrient-responsive growth factor that activates two major
signaling cascades, namely Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT.
Activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway promotes activity of
transcription factors and subsequent expression of genes
involved in proliferation and cellular growth. Initiation of
the PI3K/AKT pathway promotes decreased apoptosis by
disrupting the BCL2-Bad complex, increases protein syn-
thesis via mTOR activation, and increases glucose metab-
olism by inhibiting GSK-3β [13]. Cancer cells utilize the
IGF-1 signaling pathway to redirect their metabolic invest-
ment towards proliferation and growth, and thus reduc-
tion of IGF-1 levels in CR results in decreased tumor
growth and progression [8, 10, 11]. Addition of exogenous
IGF-1 leads to the partial reversal of the anticancer effects
of CR, further supporting the role of IGF-1 in tumorigen-
esis [10]. In addition, expression of signaling factors down-
stream of IGF-1 has been correlated with either resistance
or sensitivity to several cancer therapies [14]. Neverthe-
less, although IGF-1 signaling is a promising anticancer
target, drugs targeting the pathway have been largely
unsuccessful [12].
CR also induces activation of AMP-activated protein
kinase
(AMPK),
a
molecular
sensor
that
increases
catabolism and inhibits anabolic metabolism, working in
opposition to IGF-1-mediated activation of mTOR [4, 15].
AMPK activation in response to CR conditions results in
increased apoptosis within brain tumors while protecting
normal cells from the stress [16, 17]. AMPK induces ex-
pression of metabolic control genes, including SIRT1,
resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation and glutamino-
lysis to provide auxiliary substrates when glucose is scarce
[18]. In line with this, CR results in elevated serum glu-
tamine [19] and ketone bodies [20]. Many tumors undergo
metabolic reprogramming, including enhanced fatty acid
oxidation and glutaminolysis in addition to increased glu-
cose metabolism [21–23]. Some cancers can therefore be-
come autonomous, uncoupling their growth from the
availability of systemic factors under normal conditions.
Despite it not being clear whether administration of CR
would support tumor growth in these circumstances, it is
thought that transformed cells lack the metabolic adapt-
ability to respond to altered substrate availability, having
already invested heavily in metabolic reprograming
and thus being more sensitive to increased pressure
on ketone metabolism and fatty acid oxidation than
normal cells [24].
The AMPK/mTOR axis also controls autophagy, a
process through which proteins, macronutrients and
organelles are enveloped in double-membraned vesicles
and degraded into building blocks that can then be
shuttled into synthetic pathways. Under CR conditions,
AMPK activation stimulates increased autophagy to re-
cycle cellular components and provide needed substrates
for metabolism and homeostasis [4, 15]. Autophagy can
act as a double-edged sword in cancer – it is thought to
be tumor suppressive since defects in autophagy drive
oxidative stress, mitochondrial defects, DNA damage,
genomic instability, and tumor growth [25]. Conversely,
it is believed to be tumor promoting because established
tumors can utilize autophagy to reduce oxidative stress
and increase mitochondrial function and metabolism in
order to promote survival and overcome stress and low
nutrient conditions [25, 26]. Due to the dual role of
autophagy in cancer, autophagy inducers and inhibitors
have become targets for cancer therapy [27]. Recent
research in our lab showed that combining autophagy
inhibition with a CR regimen reduced tumor growth
more than either treatment alone [20].
Furthermore, increasing preclinical and human evidence
suggests that CR reduces inflammation [11, 28, 29]. Mul-
tiple inflammatory signaling cascades can promote the
growth and survival of neoplastic cells [30]. The reduction
of energy intake in CR reduces the amount of adipose
tissue, a major endocrine organ that secretes pro-
inflammatory factors including leptin, adiponectin, mono-
cyte chemo-attractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor,
and interleukin-6 [31]. CR in human studies is associated
with reduced adiposity and a lessened inflammatory adi-
pose secretome, as well as particularly decreased systemic
levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines [32]. In addition,
CR has been shown to consistently reduce the expression
of the pro-angiogenic factors vascular endothelial factor
[9, 33] and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [15], both of
which induce the growth of new blood vessels to provide
growing tumors with oxygen and glucose. CR has also
been shown to reduce vascularization of tumors [9, 16]. In
addition to altering systemic inflammatory mediators, CR
has been shown reduce the expression of inflammatory
genes in cancer cells, including nuclear factor kappa
B [11, 34] and peroxisome proliferator-activated re-
ceptors [35], which are ligand-activated transcription
factors involved in regulating inflammation, prolifera-
tion, and glucose and lipid homeostasis and often
expressed in cancer cells [36, 37].
CR and therapeutic response
To date, much of the research into the tumor suppres-
sive effects of CR relate to the preventative capacity of
the intervention, rather than its application as an
anticancer therapy. Recent attention has focused on the
potential of CR as an adjunct therapy for a range of
cancers in combination with traditional chemotherapy
or radiation therapy [38]. While chronic CR may be well
tolerated in preclinical and clinical studies of healthy

 individuals, patients diagnosed with cancer are at a
greater risk of weight loss due to toxic cancer therapies,
as well as cachexia and sarcopenia from tumor-derived
signals to degrade adipose and muscle tissues, to which
chronic CR may contribute. Furthermore, as CR is anti-
inflammatory, chronic CR may be a concern to patients
with immunodeficiency or following surgery. Intermittent
CR, achieved through fasting where no calories are
consumed for defined periods of time (between 24 h up to
6 days), causes similar metabolic and anti-inflammatory
alterations as seen during chronic CR, and can often result
in greater changes in the short term [39]. In contrast to
chronic CR, fasting results in glycogen release from the
liver for use as an energy source. Once glycogen stores are
depleted, amino acids and fatty acids are catabolized to
generate glucose and ketone bodies, respectively [39].
Short-term fasting has been shown to improve chemo-
therapeutic treatment with etoposide [40], mitoxantrone,
oxaliplatin [41], cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxo-
rubicin [42] in transgenic and transplant mouse models of
neuroblastoma, fibrosarcoma, glioma, melanoma, and
breast and ovarian cancers. Alternate day fasting has also
been shown to improve the radiosensitivity of mammary
tumors in mice [38, 43], likely due to enhanced oxidative
stress and DNA damage during short-term fasting on can-
cer cells. Fasting has also been shown to control circadian
clock genes, the expression of which usually oscillates at
specific intervals throughout the day and is coupled to
processes such as oxidative stress response and DNA
damage repair [44]. Chemotherapeutic treatment adminis-
tered at different times of the day has been found to im-
prove efficacy, believed to be due to circadian rhythmic
control of stress responses [45]. Fasting may therefore
improve the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies in part by
controlling the circadian rhythm.
Elegant work by Rafaghello et al. [40] demonstrated
that short-term fasting elicits differential responses to
chemotherapy in normal and cancer cells, with normal
cells inactivating growth signals, such as Ras, Akt and
IGF-1, in response to short-term fasting protecting them
from therapeutic toxicity. In contrast, cancer cells, which
have arisen due to activation of these signals and evasion
of senescence-inducing signals, do not undergo this in-
activation, remaining vulnerable to cytotoxic treatment
via chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The induction of
these cancer-specific stress responses may impact mech-
anisms related to chemoresistance, including multidrug
resistance [46].
More recently, a fasting-mimicking diet, in which mice
are fed the same amount of food as control mice, albeit
with a severely reduced caloric density, showed a similar
reduction in tumor growth as short-term starvation and
displayed synergistic therapeutic effects when combined
with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [41, 47]. Cycles
of this diet have recently been shown to improve meta-
bolic and inflammatory biomarkers associated with can-
cer risk in humans [48]. Mechanistically, the synergizing
effects of the fasting-mimicking diet were associated
with increased autophagy in the cancer cells and re-
duced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the microenviron-
ment, causing increased circulating CD8+ T cells and
reduced Treg cells, and resulting in enhanced immuno-
surveillance and clearance of tumor cells [41, 47]. More-
over, prolonged cycles of fasting have also been shown
to protect immune cells during chemotherapeutic treat-
ment [49, 50], suggesting the possibility of combining im-
munotherapies with traditional chemotherapy alongside
such dietary interventions. Similarly, CR also maintains
immunological fitness of CD4+ T cells during aging to
enhance cancer immunotherapy, specifically OX40-agonist
immunotherapy [50]. In addition, a CR regimen can reduce
desmoplasia and the inflammatory microenvironment of
tumors [9], previously shown to impede the delivery of
therapeutic drugs to the tumor cells.
While preclinical studies are mounting on the effects
of intermittent CR in combination with chemotherapy
and radiation therapy, clinical studies are slow to follow,
likely due to the concerns listed above. A summary of
past and current clinical trials of intermittent CR, fast-
ing-mimicking diets, and ketogenic diets in combination
with anticancer therapies is included in Table 1. A small
study comprising ten subjects diagnosed with malignan-
cies, including breast, esophageal, prostate, and lung,
who underwent a 48–140 h fast prior to and a 56 h post-
chemotherapy fast revealed significant improvement in
self-reported side effects of therapy, including nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and fatigue [51, 52].
Larger trials are currently underway to determine the
potential for short-term fasting in reducing the side
effects and efficacy of chemotherapies, and will likely be
the launching point for future clinical trials with inter-
mittent CR as a potential adjuvant therapy.
CR mimetics
Given the nutritional concerns of CR and fasting in
some cancer patients, CR mimetics, namely pharmaco-
logical agents that target pathways affected by CR, such
as rapamycin, metformin, resveratrol, and hydroxyci-
trate, are attractive strategies to mimic the protective
effects of CR both for cancer prevention and as adjuvant
therapies without dietary restriction. These CR mimetics
affect systemic and tumor-specific inflammation and
metabolism, and targeting these pathways may sensitize
cancers to traditional and emerging anti-cancer therapies
by reducing tumor-associated inflammation or causing
metabolic stress in the cancer cell.

 mTOR, extends lifespan and delays cancer in mice [53].
Our lab has shown that rapamycin or its analog, Afinitor®
(everolimus), can mimic the anticancer effects of CR in
mouse models of pancreatic and breast cancer [54, 55].
Signaling via the mTOR pathway has been implicated in a
broad range of chemoresistant cancers [56], and rapamycin
has been shown to reverse multidrug resistance [57].
Promising preclinical studies demonstrate that rapamycin
can
sensitize
certain
cancers
to
chemotherapy
and
radiation therapy. Active phase I and II clinical trials are
ongoing to determine the effect of combining rapamycin
with chemotherapeutic regimens, including gemcitabine
for osteosarcoma, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone in
myeloma, and mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine for
leukemia.
Another CR mimetic, metformin, is a biguanide com-
monly used to treat type 2 diabetes by inhibiting gluconeo-
genesis through indirect activation of AMPK, thus reducing
blood glucose and insulin to levels observed in CR mice
[58]. Metformin, as a monotherapy, suppresses tumor de-
velopment and/or growth in multiple experimental models,
including colon, mammary, and hematopoietic cancer
models [59]. Metformin has shown promise both in
preclinical and clinical studies, improving treatment of
colon, breast, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancers [60, 61].
Several phase II trials are currently underway to evaluate
metformin as a potential combination therapy, including
one non-small cell lung cancer study that involves a low
carbohydrate diet arm.
Resveratrol,
a
polyphenolic
compound
found
in
grapes, berries and, most famously, red wine, has also
been under consideration as a CR mimetic. Resveratrol
is believed to underlie the “French paradox,” in which
the consumption of red wine is believed to reduce
mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and certain
cancers [62]. Resveratrol
displays anti-inflammatory,
anti-oxidant, and anti-angiogenic [63] properties and
suppresses development and growth of numerous cancer
types in preclinical models, including breast, prostate,
colon, and liver. Although several in vitro and in vivo
studies have indicated that resveratrol can enhance anti-
cancer treatments [64], Fukui et al. [65] suggested that
resveratrol may actually reduce the efficacy of paclitaxel
treatment in breast cancer. Therefore, more preclinical
studies should be performed prior to progressing to
clinical trials examining resveratrol as an adjuvant anti-
cancer therapy.
An emerging CR mimetic is hydroxycitrate, a citric
acid derivative and over-the-counter weight-loss drug
that inhibits ATP citrate lyase, the enzyme that catalyzes
the conversion of citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl
CoA. Cancer cells utilize acetyl CoA as a synthetic
precursor to fuel proliferation and growth [66]; thus,
blocking acetyl CoA synthesis is a rational approach to
specifically
target
cancer
metabolism.
Furthermore,
hydroxycitrate is a potent inducer of autophagy. Never-
theless, hydroxycitrate administration alone does not
affect systemic glucose or insulin [67]. Further, although
Pietrocola et al. [41] showed enhanced anticancer effects
combining hydroxycitrate with doxorubicin and cyclo-
phosphamide, a small trial revealed no added benefit of
hydroxycitrate when administered with α-lipoic acid
alongside the standard of care [68].
Alternative dietary approaches
Further to the CR mimetic drugs above, dietary regi-
mens, such as low carbohydrate/ketogenic and intermit-
tent energy restriction (IER), may be suitable alternatives
to chronic CR in combination therapies. Low carbohy-
drate/ketogenic diets rewire energy metabolism to utilize
ketones derived from fatty acids, in particular medium
chain triglycerides, as an energy source rather than

 glucose. These diets mimic many of the metabolic and
anti-inflammatory properties of CR, including reduced
blood glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 [69], as well as the oxi-
dation of fatty acids and generation of ketones. The ke-
togenic diet has long been used successfully as a means
to reduce epileptic seizures [70] and more recently in
type 2 diabetes [71]. Further, studies have shown that
the diet is well tolerated in cancer patients either as an
adjuvant or monotherapy [72, 73]. Use as a monotherapy
has been shown to halt progression of soft palate cancer
[73], suggesting that, in some circumstances, a ketogenic
diet alone may be sufficient for cancer management.
Preclinical studies have shown promising results for low
carbohydrate/ketogenic diets in reducing tumor growth
in breast [74], prostate [75], brain [76], and gastric
cancer models [77], and it has been shown to promote
response to adjuvant radiation therapy [72]. In addition,
a switch to a low carbohydrate/ketogenic diet has been
shown to
prevent
cachexia in patients undergoing
chemotherapy, suggesting this dietary approach may be
a suitable alternative for cancer patients at risk of cach-
exia, sarcopenia, and weight loss [78].
IER, such as the 5–2 diet, in which an individual
adheres to severe restriction (75% fewer calories) on 2
non-consecutive days while eating a normal, healthy diet
on the remaining 5 days, has been a successful weight
loss approach in human studies, and results in similar
improvements in metabolic parameters such as insulin
sensitivity [3]. A randomized trial is currently underway
comparing IER and chronic CR in combination with
taxane treatment in breast cancer patients. Preliminary
results from this study suggest that IER is tolerable in
patients receiving chemotherapy, and the outcome of
this trial will add to the evidence for CR as a supportive
treatment and evaluate IER as a feasible alternative to
CR as an anticancer therapy.
Conclusions
Dietary interventions are attractive as inexpensive sup-
portive anticancer therapies. CR is an established tumor
preventative regimen, reducing systemic inflammation
and growth factor signaling, as well as improving meta-
bolic markers. Improved metabolism and inflammation
are also likely mechanisms through which CR may re-
duce tumor growth and enhance therapeutic response
(Fig. 1). In addition, oncogenic transformation and loss
of senescence in cancer cells may render them more sen-
sitive to CR than normal cells (Fig. 1). As chronic CR is
contraindicated for many cancer patients at risk for weight
loss, cachexia, and immunosuppression, intermittent CR,
fasting-mimicking diets, low carbohydrate/ketogenic diets,
or CR mimetic drugs may be more suitable. Fasting and
Fig. 1 Mechanisms through which calorie restriction (CR) affects response to anticancer therapy. CR, fasting, or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs)
cause reduced Akt/mTOR and Ras signaling in normal cells, resulting in senescence, reduced growth, and protection from cytotoxic treatment, while
in tumor cells, oncogenic signals remain and cells are sensitive to anti-mitotic therapies. CR, fasting, and FMD also reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines
in the circulation and in the tumor microenvironment niche, as well as reduced leptin, insulin, IGF-1, and glucose. CR can reduce desmoplasia
surrounding the tumor tissue, which may facilitate better therapeutic drug delivery to the tumor cells. CR can also aid in immunosurveillance of tumors
by reducing Treg populations that inhibit cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. This figure has not been published elsewhere

 low carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce side
effects and to improve chemotherapy and radiation
therapy in animal models, and there is great promise for
these interventions in the clinic. More preclinical studies
are required to determine in which cancers, at which
stage, and in what combinations CR mimetic drugs may
prove most effective. Future studies should take into con-
sideration (1) the risk of cachexia in a patient population,
whereby those at high risk may benefit from a ketogenic
diet or short-term fasting; (2) the immunologic state of
the enrolled patients, when CR or rapamycin treatment
may be detrimental to wound healing or inflammatory re-
sponses; and (3) the metabolic state of patients, with dia-
betic patients in particular being at risk of adverse effects
during chronic CR or fasting regimens, whereby treatment
with metformin or a ketogenic diet may be of benefit.
While in the short-term studies will need to focus on the
safety and added benefit to current therapies, future
studies may also focus on the potential of CR in enhancing
the response to lower doses of chemotherapy and
radiation therapy. In summary, CR and its mimetics show
promise
as
supportive
anticancer
therapies.
Clinical
studies are ongoing and will inform on the potential use
of these dietary and drug treatments alongside conven-
tional treatments.
