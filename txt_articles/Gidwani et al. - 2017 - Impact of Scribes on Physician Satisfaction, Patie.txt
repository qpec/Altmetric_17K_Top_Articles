Impact of Scribes on Physician Satisfaction, Patient  
Satisfaction, and Charting Efficiency: A Randomized 
Controlled Trial
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Scribes are increasingly being used in clinical practice despite a lack of 
high-quality evidence regarding their effects. Our objective was to evaluate the 
effect of medical scribes on physician satisfaction, patient satisfaction, and chart-
ing efficiency.
METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which physicians in an 
academic family medicine clinic were randomized to 1 week with a scribe then 
1 week without a scribe for the course of 1 year. Scribes drafted all relevant 
documentation, which was reviewed by the physician before attestation and sign-
ing. In encounters without a scribe, the physician performed all charting duties. 
Our outcomes were physician satisfaction, measured by a 5-item instrument that 
included physicians’ perceptions of chart quality and chart accuracy; patient sat-
isfaction, measured by a 6-item instrument; and charting efficiency, measured by 
time to chart close.
RESULTS Scribes improved all aspects of physician satisfaction, including over-
all satisfaction with clinic (OR 
= 
10.75), having enough face time with patients 
(OR 
= 
3.71), time spent charting (OR 
= 
86.09), chart quality (OR 
= 
7.25), and 
chart accuracy (OR 
= 
4.61) (all P values <.001). Scribes had no effect on patient 
satisfaction. Scribes increased the proportion of charts that were closed within 
48 hours (OR =
1.18, P 
= 
.028).
CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, we have conducted the first randomized con-
trolled trial of scribes. We found that scribes produced significant improvements 
in overall physician satisfaction, satisfaction with chart quality and accuracy, and 
charting efficiency without detracting from patient satisfaction. Scribes appear 
to be a promising strategy to improve health care efficiency and reduce physi-
cian burnout.

INTRODUCTION
E
lectronic health records (EHRs) have radically transformed the 
practice of medicine. Driven by federal meaningful use incentives 
and penalties,1,2 more than 95% of US hospitals and 56% of office-
based physicians have adopted EHRs.3,4 Electronic health records hold 
promise to improve patient safety, quality of care, physician efficiency and 
performance, patient-physician communication, patient participation, cost 
of care, and health outcomes.5-9 There is also growing evidence, however, 
that in their current state, EHRs are associated with decreased physician 
productivity and revenue,10 negative patient-physician interactions and 
relationships,11 and widespread physician dissatisfaction.12-14
More than one-half of all US physicians experience burnout, with pri-
mary care physicians having one of the highest rates.15 Among the largest 
contributors to burnout is a growing clerical workload.16-18 For every hour 
physicians provide direct face time to patients, 2 more hours are spent on 
EHR and desk work.19 Many physicians leave most charting to the end of

the day, and spend 1 to 2 hours each night working on 
the EHR.19
One strategy to decrease clerical burden is the 
use of scribes. Scribes are nonlicensed team members 
trained to document patient encounters in real time 
under the direct supervision of a physician.20 Scribes 
do not act independently but may assist with chart-
ing, recording laboratory and radiology results, and 
supporting physician workflow with EHR data entry.21 
Although the use of scribes as physician extenders in 
emergency departments has been reported as early 
as the 1970s, it is only recently that the popularity of 
scribes has skyrocketed.22 Scribes are currently being 
used in more than 1,000 hospitals and clinics across 
44 states.23 It is estimated that by 2020, there will be 
100,000 scribes in the United States, or 1 scribe for 
every 9 physicians.23
Despite the increasing presence of scribes, method-
ologically rigorous studies regarding their impact are 
lacking. Two systematic reviews found, using data from 
observational studies, that scribes may improve rev-
enue, patient and physician satisfaction, productivity, 
efficiency, and the quality of patient-physician interac-
tions.24,25 There has been no randomized controlled 
study of scribes, and few studies have been undertaken 
in the primary care setting. Given that most office 
visits are to primary care physicians,26 research in this 
setting is particularly warranted.
METHODS
Design
Physicians were randomly assigned to 1 week practic-
ing with a scribe then 1 week without a scribe for the 
course of 52 weeks. Randomization at the physician-
week level was chosen instead of randomizing at the 
level of patients, as variations in length of patient 
appointments posed challenges for proper allocation 
of scribes across patients and was too disruptive to 
normal clinic flow. We also chose not to randomize 
at the physician level, as the small number of physi-
cians included in this study would not properly protect 
against imbalance in the scribe and no-scribe groups. 
During the week in which a physician was assigned 
a scribe, the scribe attended all appointments and 
drafted all relevant documentation, including the his-
tory and physical findings, objective examination find-
ings, laboratory and radiology results, assessment and 
plan, and patient instructions. The physician reviewed 
the note, attested to its accuracy, and signed it before 
the chart was closed. During the week in which the 
physician was not assigned a scribe, the physician per-
formed all charting duties. The EHR used was the out-
patient version of Epic (Epic Systems Corporation).
The study was conducted from July 2015 to June 
2016. Four physicians and 2 scribes participated in 
the study, which was undertaken in a family medi-
cine clinic associated with a large academic medical 
center in Northern California. All physicians were 
board-certified in family medicine and had an aver-
age of 6 years of practice experience. None had prior 
experience working with scribes. As part-time clini-
cians, each physician in the study had 4, 4-hour clinic 
sessions per week when data were collected. Both 
scribes were college graduates who completed an 
80-hour training course administered by a commercial 
scribe company (Elite Medical Scribes). One scribe 
was assigned to 2 physicians in the first 6 months of 
the study; in the second 6 months, that scribe was 
assigned to the other 2 physicians. This allowed us to 
test for any learning effects that may have occurred in 
the physician-scribe dyads.
Physician Satisfaction
Physician satisfaction was measured by a self-
administered 5-item questionnaire. Answers were 
recorded using a 7-point Likert scale, with a value of 
1 indicating strong disagreement (strongly dissatis-
fied) and 7 indicating strong agreement (strongly 
satisfied). Physicians were offered 1 questionnaire 
after each 4-hour clinic session. For data analyses, we 
dichotomized each answer into strongly satisfied vs 
non–strongly satisfied (7 vs 1 to 6) because of skewness 
in results. In sensitivity analyses, we tested alternate 
ways to characterize the outcome by dichotomizing 
scores from 1 to 5 and 6 to 7. To investigate the effect 
of scribes on aspects of physician satisfaction, each 
item was assessed using its own fixed-effects logistic 
regression equation with the physician questionnaire 
as the unit of analysis and accommodating multiple 
observations per physician. We adjusted for whether 
the interaction was new so we could test any learning 
effects over time within physician-scribe dyads. Specifi-
cally, we investigated whether a physician paired with a 
scribe had significantly lower satisfaction scores during 
the first quarter than during the second quarter that the 
same physician and scribe were paired. We adjusted for 
multiple hypothesis testing using the conservative Bon-
ferroni correction, resulting in an α of .01.27
Patient Satisfaction
Patient satisfaction was measured using a shortened, 
validated, 6-item questionnaire designed for the pri-
mary care setting.28 Each patient was asked to complete 
the questionnaire immediately after the appointment. 
To encourage completion, questionnaires were made 
anonymous. Answers were recorded using a 7-point 
Likert scale, with 1 indicating strong disagreement

(strongly dissatisfied) and 7 indicating strong agreement 
(strongly satisfied). Each response was dichotomized 
into strongly satisfied (7) vs non–strongly satisfied (1 to 
6) because of skewness of the distribution. In sensitivity 
analyses, we tested alternate ways to characterize the 
outcome, specifically dichotomizing scores from 1 to 5 
and 6 to 7. We investigated each item separately using 
its own fixed-effects logistic regression equation with 
the patient questionnaire as the unit of analysis, clus-
tering questionnaires within physician. All tests were 
evaluated against a Bonferroni-corrected α of .007.
Charting Efficiency
Physician efficiency was measured as the time to chart 
close, which is calculated as the time from appointment 
start to the physician signing the chart note, which is 
marked by timestamps in the EHR. Industry standards 
(Medicare documentation guidelines)29 state that charts 
should be completed within 48 hours; therefore, we 
dichotomized time to close chart into 48 hours or less 
vs more than 48 hours. We ran fixed-effects logistic 
regression with chart as the unit of analysis, accommo-
dating clustering of charts within physician.
This study was exempted from formal review by 
the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University 
School of Medicine.
RESULTS
Physician Satisfaction 
A total of 361 physician satisfaction questionnaires 
were completed, for a 73.1% response rate (Table 1). 
Physicians were more likely to complete a question-
naire when a scribe was present (53.2%) than when a 
scribe was not (46.8%). Scribes produced significantly 
higher physician satisfaction in all aspects of care 
and charting (Tables 2-4). Physicians who worked 
with a scribe had 10.75 the adjusted odds of express-
ing high satisfaction with their clinic that day, 3.71 
the adjusted odds of having enough face time with 
patients, and 86.09 the adjusted odds of expressing 
high satisfaction with the amount of time they spent 
charting (all P <.001). Scribes increased physician 
satisfaction with the quality and accuracy of their 
charts. Physicians reported 7.25 the adjusted odds of 
being satisfied with their chart quality when a scribe 
was present (P <.001). There was no 
difference in satisfaction with quality 
when the physician-scribe dyad was 
new vs established (P = .451). Physi-
cians reported 4.61 the adjusted odds 
of being satisfied with chart accuracy 
when a scribe was present (P < .001). 
Physicians did report being less 
satisfied with chart accuracy when 
the physician-scribe dyad was new 
(adjusted OR = 0.39) vs established,

but results were not significant using a Bonferroni-
corrected α of .01 (P = .019). There was no difference 
in significance of the impact of scribes on physician 
survey results when we dichotomized the responses 
into 1 to 5 vs 6 to 7.
Patient Satisfaction 
A total of 1,475 patient satisfaction questionnaires 
were completed for an 87.7% response rate (Table 1). 
Patients were more likely to complete a questionnaire 
when a scribe was present (54.8%) than when a scribe 
was not (45.2%). In adjusted analyses, there 
were no significant differences in any aspect 
of patient satisfaction between physician 
visits in which a scribe was or was not pres-
ent (Table 2 and Table 5). Satisfaction across 
patient questionnaires, however, was high 
with or without a scribe, with more than 
91% of patients in either group reporting 
being highly satisfied with their care. There 
was no difference in significance of the 
impact of scribes on patient survey results 
when we dichotomized the responses into 1 
to 5 vs 6 to 7.
Charting Efficiency
Scribes improved time to close chart. In 
unadjusted analyses, 28.5% of charts that 
were drafted by physicians were closed in 48 
hours relative to 32.6% of charts drafted by 
scribes. In adjusted analyses, scribed charts 
had 1.18 the adjusted odds of being closed 
within 48 hours compared with physician-
only charts (P = .028) (Table 6).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, we have undertaken the 
first randomized controlled trial evaluating 
the effects of medical scribes. We found 
that scribes significantly improved physi-
cian satisfaction across all measured aspects 
of patient care and documentation. Scribes 
improved physician-perceived chart qual-
ity and chart accuracy, as well as charting 
efficiency as measured by the likelihood of 
closing a chart within 48 hours.
When working with a scribe, physicians 
were much more satisfied with how their 
clinic went, the length of time they spent 
face-to-face with patients, and the time 
they spent charting. These findings suggest 
that scribes may have a protective effect on 
physicians’ well-being. Implementation of 
team documentation is an important com-
ponent of achieving the Quadruple Aim,30 a 
patient-centered approach to care that also 
emphasizes improving the work life of physi-
cians. Spending less time on documentation 
frees up the physician to pursue direct clini-

cal care and care coordination, thus enhancing joy of 
practice and preventing burnout. In academic centers, 
scribes provide faculty physicians more time to teach 
medical students and residents.31
We found that not only were physicians satisfied 
with the quality and accuracy of charting done by 
scribes, they were more satisfied with scribed charts 
than with their own. This finding is consistent with a 
study suggesting that scribed notes are of higher qual-
ity than physician-only notes.32 Patient encounters in 
primary care are often highly complex; scribes enable 
physicians to capture all the important details in the 
note while communicating effectively with the patient 
in the room.
During a typical day in the ambulatory setting, 
49% of physician time is spent on EHR and desk work, 
whereas only 27% is spent face-to-face with patients.19 
Physicians can use EHR shortcuts, such as copy and 
paste,33 but these actions are associated with a risk 
of documentation error that can jeopardize patient 
safety.34,35 In addition, documentation competes with 
panel management and EHR inbox completion. It is 
estimated that the average primary care physician 
receives 76.9 EHR inbox notifications daily, requiring 
an investment of approximately 66.8 minutes 
per day.36 Eliminating the burden of writing 
notes affords more time for physicians to 
attend to the tasks of panel management dur-
ing, not after, their workday.
Our study found no difference in patient 
satisfaction between visits with or without 
a scribe, perhaps because of ceiling effects; 
patients expressed high satisfaction both 
during visits with and without a scribe. Nev-
ertheless, we found that the presence of a 
scribe did not decrease patient satisfaction. 
This finding has been found in other nonran-
domized studies, even in settings as sensitive 
as a urology practice.37
Our study is the first to evaluate charting 
efficiency in a randomized controlled man-
ner. We found that scribed charts were more 
likely to be closed within 48 hours compared 
with charts completed by physicians alone. 
Charts that are completed in a timely man-
ner allow patient data to be accessed by 
other physicians in the health care system, 
which is particularly important to safety and 
effective care coordination. Charts com-
pleted in a timely manner may also be more 
accurate than those completed multiple days 
after the patient’s visit.
This randomized controlled trial was con-
ducted at a single family medicine clinic in an 
academic medical center. Although our unit 
of analysis was a physicians’ day or patient 
encounter, our study’s biggest limitation is 
the relatively few physicians and scribes. Our 
findings are positive with respect to physi-
cian satisfaction and efficiency, but future 
randomized studies should be conducted 
with large sample sizes and across multiple 
institutions to improve the generalizability 
of these findings. The physician satisfaction 
instrument we used measured markers related 
to joy of practice and was deemed feasible

for repeated use, but it was not a validated survey of 
joy of practice or burnout. Our findings of improved 
efficiency, as measured by time to chart close, would 
be strengthened by future work using other objective 
approaches, such as time and motion analyses. Our 
data show that physicians reported higher satisfaction 
with the quality and accuracy of charting when scribes 
were present; future work should evaluate chart qual-
ity in an objective way with blinded observers using a 
validated instrument. We also found that patient sat-
isfaction was not affected by the presence of a scribe, 
but we believe that qualitative work would better elu-
cidate patients’ perceptions of scribes. Other worthy 
avenues of research include evaluating team-based care 
models using medical assistants or nurses as scribes,38 
the effect of scribes on physician productivity and rev-
enue, as well as cost-benefit analyses, which have been 
described by others39-41 but warrant further research in 
the primary care setting.
The challenge of modifying physicians’ practices to 
accommodate EHRs without sacrificing quality of care 
or quality of physician-patient interactions is not trivial. 
Some have suggested that scribes are not an appropriate 
solution, arguing that they are no substitute for better 
functioning EHRs or may remove some of the pressure 
on EHR designers to improve their systems.23 We agree 
that scribes are not a replacement for EHR redesign, 
but we do consider them an immediate solution that 
can be implemented while the more onerous and time-
consuming problem of EHR redesign is also tackled. 
We also believe scribes can serve as a complement to a 
high-functioning EHR, as the latter will still require the 
mundane capture of information that does not require 
a physician. By reducing the time that physicians spend 
on clerical tasks, scribes serve an important function in 
a multidisciplinary health care team.
