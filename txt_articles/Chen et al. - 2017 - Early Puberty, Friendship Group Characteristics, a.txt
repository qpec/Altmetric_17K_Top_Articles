abstract
OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between advanced 
pubertal development and adolescent dating abuse (ADA) and to test if this relationship is 
moderated by friendship group characteristics in a nationally representative sample of US 
girls.
METHODS: Data were drawn from wave 1 and 2 (1995–1996) of the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The sample included 3870 girls aged 13 to 17 years, 
all of whom were in romantic and/or nonromantic sexual relationships. Relative pubertal 
development was measured as perceived physical development as compared with peers 
of the same age and race and age at menarche at wave 1. Participants reported at wave 
2 whether they had experienced any verbal or physical abuse in their relationships. 
Friendship group characteristics included the percentage of boy friends, older friends, and 
friends’ risk behavior level.
RESULTS: Negative binomial regression analyses revealed an interaction between advanced 
pubertal development and percentage of boy friends on ADA victimization, adjusted for age, 
race, parents’ marital status, household income, number of relationships, self-esteem, self-
control, and antisocial behavior history. Advanced pubertal development was associated 
with more ADA victimization when girls’ friendship groups comprised a higher percentage 
of boys.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the importance of pubertal timing and friendship group 
characteristics to ADA victimization. Early pubertal development is a risk marker for ADA 
victimization, particularly when a higher percentage of girls’ friends are boys. Pediatricians 
and adolescent health specialists should be sensitive to the elevated risk for ADA 
victimization in early-maturing girls.

According to the 2013 Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey, 20% and 10% of 
high school-attending girls and boys, 
respectively, in the United States 
reported experiencing sexual or 
physical abuse by a dating partner 
in the past year.1 Other studies using 
nationally representative samples 
have also found that 31% to 40% 
of girls and 27% to 30% of boys 
are victimized by psychological 
aggression, physical aggression, 
or both by a dating partner 
during adolescence.2, 
 
3 Not only 
is adolescent dating abuse (ADA) 
relatively common, but youth who 
are victimized are subsequently at 
elevated risk for depression, anxiety, 
eating disorders, substance use, 
2– 
4 
and suicidal behavior.2, 
 
5, 
 
6 Thus, ADA 
is a significant public health problem. 
One previous study has shown that 
girls who make an early transition 
to puberty are at elevated risk for 
ADA, 
7 but more research is needed 
to understand the conditions under 
which early-maturing girls are at 
heightened risk.
The current study is designed 
to inform prevention efforts by 
assessing the relationship between 
pubertal timing and ADA in a 
nationally representative sample 
of US girls. Our hypothesis was that 
early puberty would elevate the 
risk for subsequent ADA, especially 
when girls’ friendship groups 
included a high percentage of boys, 
older friends, and when friends 
participated in high levels of risk 
behavior.
Off-time pubertal development is 
defined as making the transition to 
puberty relatively earlier or later 
than one’s peers.8 
– 
10 The stage-
termination hypothesis proposes 
that early-maturing individuals have 
less time to acquire, integrate, and 
consolidate the coping and adaptive 
skills needed to successfully master 
the developmental challenges 
associated with the transition to 
adolescence.10– 
12 Consistent with 
this hypothesis, early puberty has 
been associated with emotional 
and behavioral problems, including 
externalizing and internalizing 
problems, substance abuse, eating 
disorders, and poor academic 
achievement.13, 
 
14
Girls who make an early transition 
to puberty may be at heightened risk 
for ADA. Girls who are physically 
mature tend to attract the attention 
of boys13, 
 
15 and girls who make an 
early transition to puberty are often 
sexually active at a younger age 
than later-maturers.15, 
 
16 However, 
there are relatively few data on the 
prevalence of ADA among early-
maturing girls. Studying a closely 
related topic, Craig et al17 found 
that early-maturing adolescents 
were at higher risk for same-sex and 
opposite-sex sexual harassment and 
opposite-sex relational aggression 
victimization. Similarly, a study 
revealed that early maturation was 
associated with physical violence 
victimization for both boys and 
girls, although not necessarily in the 
context of dating relationships.18 
In the only previous study focused 
specifically on ADA and pubertal 
timing, Foster et al7 found that 
adjusting for the impact of various 
covariates, early-maturating girls 
were at greater risk for ADA than 
their on-time and late-maturing 
peers. However, they did not test 
how the effect of pubertal timing 
varied as a function of adolescents’ 
social environment.
Although early-maturing girls may 
be at elevated risk for ADA, it is also 
true that not all early-maturing girls 
will be victimized.19 The contextual 
amplification hypothesis postulates 
that certain contextual conditions 
will accentuate the negative effect 
of early maturation.20 In the current 
study, we focused on peer context 
(ie, friendship) as a potential 
modifier of the association between 
early puberty and ADA, because 
peer context is highly salient in 
adolescence and relevant to dating, 
sexual, and romantic encounters. 
Adolescents spend increasingly 
more time with their friends than 
with their parents, and friends and 
romantic partners are influential 
and extremely important sources of 
social support.21 At least 3 aspects of 
the friendship group could increase 
the likelihood that girls will be 
exposed to ADA. First, girls with a 
higher percentage of boys in their 
friendship group may be more likely 
to be dating, which could potentially 
expose them to ADA. Second, older 
friends are also more likely to be 
involved in ADA, 
22 as victims or 
perpetrators, and having friends 
who are involved in ADA is a risk 
factor for one’s own ADA.23, 
 
24 Thus, 
as the proportion of older friends 
in the friendship groups increase, 
so may girls’ risk for ADA. Third, 
friends who engage in high levels of 
risk behaviors (eg, underage alcohol 
consumption, fighting) are likely to 
be involved in aggressive behavior 
and delinquency both inside and 
outside of dating relationships.6, 
 
25
Compared with on-time and later-
maturing girls, early-maturing 
girls may be more vulnerable to 
the effect of these friendship group 
characteristics26, 
 
27 because they will 
have had less time to develop coping 
skills10, 
 
12 and may have experienced 
a variety of hardships that limit 
their capacity to remove themselves 
from or resolve situations in sexual 
or romantic relationships that 
could become abusive. Thus, early-
maturing girls may be at greater risk 
for ADA relative to later-maturing 
girls if their network includes a high 
percentage of boy friends, older 
friends, or friends who engage in risk 
behavior. The current study tests 
these hypotheses.

in-home interview sample of the 
National Longitudinal Study of 
Adolescent to Adult Health (Add

Health). Add Health is a longitudinal 
study of a nationally representative 
sample of adolescents from the 
United States who were in grades 
7 through 12 in 1994 to 1995 
when the study began. Our final 
analytic sample comprised 3870 girl 
participants aged 13 to 17 years self-
identified as white (61%), African 
American (22.5%), and Hispanic 
(16.5%). Detailed information 
regarding how the final sample 
was derived can be found in in the 
Supplemental Information.
Measures
ADA
ADA was measured at the wave 2 
in-home interview. Each participant 
identified up to 3 romantic 
relationships and 3 nonromantic 
relationships that involved sexual 
activity in the past 18 months 
and reported ADA victimization 
information (but not perpetration) 
in each relationship. Of the 3870 
participants, all of whom had been  
in romantic and/or nonromantic 
sexual relationships, 9.15% (n =  
354) were involved in both 
romantic and nonromantic sexual 
relationships, 89.17% (n = 3451) 
were involved only in romantic 
relationships, and 1.68% (n = 65) 
were involved only in nonromantic 
sexual relationships. Sixty-seven 
percent of the participants had only 
1 relationship. For each relationship, 
participants reported whether their 
partners insulted them in public, 
swore at them, threatened them with 
violence, pushed/shoved them in 
public, or threw something at them 
(0 = no, 1 = yes). Responses were 
coded as missing if participants did 
not have a partner in the past 18 
months or if they refused or did not 
know how to answer the question. 
The same 5 items have been used to 
measure ADA in previous studies.2, 
 
7  
A participant was considered to  
have experienced a particular form 
of abuse if she reported experiencing 
that form of abuse ≥1 time in 
any relationship. Thus, across all 
relationships, participants could 
have experienced up to 5 forms of 
ADA. Thirty percent of participants 
reported that they experienced at 
least 1 form of ADA.
Relative Pubertal Development
Both a subjective and an objective 
measure of relative pubertal 
development were used. The 
subjective measure was a single item 
reported at wave 1 indicating how 
advanced participants thought their 
physical development was compared 
with other girls their age (1 = “I 
look younger than most” to 5 = "I 
look older than most”). One-third 
of the participants reported that 
they looked average compared with 
their peers. The objective measure 
of relative pubertal development 
was based on participants’ reports 
(from wave 1 or 2) of how old they 
were when they had their first 
menstrual period. Menarcheal age 
was standardized within participants 
of the same age and race. We 
multiplied this standardized score by 
the value of −1 so that higher scores 
indicated more advanced pubertal 
development compared with peers. 
We use the phrase “advanced 
pubertal development” to refer to 
girls who either had a relatively 
earlier age at menarche compared 
with peers of the same age and race 
or described themselves as being 
more physically developed compared 
with peers of the same age and race.
Friendship Group Characteristics
The Add Health study collected 
network data at wave 1 from 
all students who attended each 
participating school, enabling a 
comprehensive assessment of a 
participant’s friendship group. Only 
schools in which >50% of the student 
body completed the questionnaire 
(90% of all participating schools) 
were used to calculate the network 
measures. Each participant was 
asked to nominate up to 5 girl and 
5 boy friends from the roster of all 
students enrolled in the participant’s 
school and/or in the sister school. 
Nominations were used in the 
current study if both the participant 
(ie, nominator) and the individuals 
named as the participant’s friends 
(ie, nominees) were uniquely 
identifiable students who completed 
an in-school questionnaire. In the 
current study, we used the ego-
send network, which included all 
individuals the participant nominated 
as friends, even if these nominated 
friends did not nominate the 
participant as a friend in return. The 
use of peer network data allows us to 
determine features of the friendship 
group based on the nominated 
friends’ self-reports of behavior and 
demographic characteristics rather 
than on the participant’s perceptions 
of these characteristics.
We identified 3 characteristics of 
participants’ friendship groups. The 
first was the percentage of older 
friends, defined as the percentage of 
nominated friends who were at least 
1 year older than the participant. 
The second was the percentage of 
boy friends, which was defined as 
the percentage of boy friends in a 
participant’s friendship group. The 
third was risk behaviors among 
friends, which was based on the 
nominated friends’ reports of how 
often (0 = never; 1 = once or twice;  
6 = nearly every day) they engaged in 5 
risk behaviors in the past 12 months 
including (1) smoking cigarettes, (2) 
drinking beer, wine, or liquor, (3) 
getting drunk, (4) lying to parents 
or guardians, (5) skipping school 
without an excuse, and how often 
(0 = never; 4 = >7 times) they were 
in physical fights. To adjust for the 
density of the friendship groups, 
the item score was divided by the 
number of friends nominated. Risk 
behavior items were z-transformed 
and then summed to represent the 
level of risk behavior among friends. 
The measure of risk behavior among 
friends had good internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α = 0.79).

Covariates
We included a range of covariates in 
the analysis (Table 1). All covariates 
were drawn from the wave 1 in-home 
interview. Demographic covariates 
at wave 1 were age, participants’ 
race, whether parents were married, 
and the household income. We also 
included the number of relationships, 
self-esteem, self-control, and 
antisocial behavior at wave 1 because 
of their association with ADA in 
the literature.28 
– 
30 All but parents’ 
marital status was correlated 
with ADA, and all covariates were 
significantly correlated with at least 
1 of the main variables of interest 
(ie, friendship group characteristics 
and relative pubertal development). 
Detailed information about the 
covariates are reported in the 
Supplemental Information.
analysis Plan
We used negative binomial 
regression to test the hypothesis that 
the association between advanced 
pubertal development and ADA at 
wave 2 would be strongest when 
the friendship groups included a 
greater percentage of older friends 
and boy friends and when friends 
engaged in more risk behaviors 
at wave 1. Friendship group 
characteristics and relative pubertal 
development were mean-centered 
to facilitate interpretation. First, we 
tested the main effects of advanced 
pubertal development and the 3 
friendship group characteristics 
on ADA, adjusting for the effects 
of covariates. Next, we included 
the three 2-way interaction 
terms between relative pubertal 
development and each of the 3 
friendship group characteristics. We 
ran the analyses separately for the 
objective and the subjective measure 
of relative pubertal development. 
Analyses were conducted in Mplus 
631 by using maximum likelihood 
estimation with robust SE, and 
missing data were handled with the 
full information maximum likelihood 
method. Analyses were adjusted 
for the stratified and clustered 
sampling design of Add Health and 
incorporated sampling weights that 
adjusted for differential response and 
attrition rates over time.
ResulTs
Girls with more advanced pubertal 
development were more likely 
to be dating (see Supplemental 
Information) and reported more 
ADA (Table 1). The correlations 
between the 2 measures of relative 
pubertal timing and ADA were 
statistically significant but small in 
effect sizes (r = 0.06 and 0.07 for 
objective and subjective pubertal 
timing, respectively). Having 
more relationships, being older, 
living in a family with a lower 
household income, having lower 
self-esteem, engaging in more 
antisocial behaviors at wave 1, and 
being white versus Hispanic were 
associated with higher levels of ADA 
across all 4 models (Table 2). As 
seen in Table 2 (model 1), the main

effects of the objective measure 
of relative pubertal development 
and risk behaviors among friends 
were statistically significant. One 
unit increase in relative pubertal 
development was associated with a 
14% increase in ADA. In addition, 1 
unit increase in risk behaviors among 
friends was associated with a 3% 
increase in ADA. A similar pattern of 
results emerged for the subjective 
measure of relative pubertal 
development (Table 2, model 3).
The effects of the objective and 
subjective measures of relative 
pubertal development were 
moderated by the percentage of boys 
in girls’ friendship groups (Table 2, 
model 2 and 4). Figure 1A reveals the 
region of significance for the slope 
of the objective measure of relative 
pubertal development on ADA. When 
the proportion of boys in a friendship 
group was <29%, the association 
between relative menarcheal age and 
ADA was not statistically significant. 
However, when the percentage of 
boys in a girls’ friendship group was 
≥29%, having a relatively earlier 
menarcheal age was associated 
with ADA, and the magnitude of 
this association increased as the 
percentage of boy friends increased. 
 
Figure 2A illustrates the simple 
slope effects. Results involving 
the subjective measure of relative 
pubertal development were similar 
to those involving the objective 
measure (Table 2, model 4; Figs 1B 
and 2B).
To test the robustness of our findings, 
we repeated analyses using an 
alternative ADA score that summed 
across adolescents’ reports of all 
forms of ADA across all relationships. 
Negative binomial regression 
revealed similar results to those 
reported in Table 2 when using this 
alternative ADA score. The observed 
relationship between pubertal timing 
and ADA did not differ significantly 
between younger and older girls (see 
Supplemental Information).
DIscussIOn
Using a nationally representative 
sample of US girls, we found that 
girls who made an early transition to 
puberty relative to their peers of the 
same age and race were at elevated 
risk for ADA. Early-maturing girls 
whose friendship groups included a 
greater percentage of boys were at

exacerbated risk, even accounting 
for the fact that girls who were 
relatively more physically advanced 
had a higher number of romantic 
or sexual relationships than girls 
who were less physically advanced. 
Findings were replicated with both 
objective and subjective ratings 
of relative pubertal development, 
the first reflecting girls’ age at 
menarche, and the second reflecting 
their perceptions of their physical 
development relative to girls their 
age and race.
One reason that having a greater 
percentage of boys in a friendship 
group may specifically increase 
risk for ADA for early-maturing 
girls is because early-maturing girls 
are more likely to be in romantic, 
dating, or sexual relationships with 
their friends than later-maturing 
girls are.15 Boys may find early-
maturing girls attractive because 
they are more physically developed 
than their on-time/later-maturing 
peers15, 
 
32, 
 
33 and early-maturing 
girls may be more likely than their 
later-maturing peers to seek out 
boy friends to develop romantic 
or sexual relationships because 
of their relative sexual maturity. 
Thus, early-maturing girls are at 
heightened risk for ADA than their 
later-maturing peers because of the 
higher exposure. Second, compared 
with on-time or late-maturing girls, 
those who make an early transition 
to adolescence engage in higher 
levels of externalizing behavior.34 
The spectrum of risky behaviors 
that includes externalizing problems 
is hypothesized to result from the 
maturational gap between the brain’s 
reward system (which is activated 
by pubertal hormones35) and the 
cognitive control system (which is 
not fully mature until individuals 
are in their mid-to-late 20s).36, 
 
37 
Thus, early maturing girls may be at 
increased risk for ADA when their 
friendship group comprises a higher 
percentage of boys not only because 
they have more opportunities to be 
in romantic or sexual relationships, 
but also because they may perpetrate 
abuse that subsequently elevates 
the chances that they will be 
victimized.38
Risk behaviors among friends did not 
moderate the association between 
relative pubertal development 
and ADA, but it had a statistically 
significant main effect. Individuals 
who engage in risk behaviors are 
at elevated risk for perpetrating 
ADA.6, 
 
39 Adolescents with many 
peers who engage in delinquent and 
aggressive behavior might perceive 
such behavior, including ADA, as 
normative. If girls are dating these 
risk-taking friends, they would 
be at elevated risk for ADA. Thus, 
risk behaviors among friends may 
increase girls’ risk of ADA in general, 
and on-time/late-maturing girls were 
just as susceptible to this impact as 
their early-maturing counterparts.
The current study highlighted the 
importance of early puberty and 
friendship group characteristics in 
ADA victimization. A recent study 
showed that only 55% of parents 
talked to their children about 
dating abuse, and that parents were 
significantly less likely to discuss 
dating abuse than other sensitive 
topics, such as drugs or family 
finance.40 Our findings suggest 
that parents need to talk to their 
children about ADA before puberty 
and that they should be aware of 
who their children’s friends are. 
In addition, schools can provide 
developmentally appropriate healthy 
dating curricula for elementary and

middle school, so that girls who 
make an early transition to puberty 
are better prepared to differentiate 
abusive dating behaviors from 
normative dating behaviors. Finally, 
pediatricians can also play an active 
role in ADA prevention/intervention 
by being aware of the risks that early-
maturing girls face and being alert for 
signs of ADA.
Limitations of this study include 
the fact that pubertal timing was 
assessed by using self-report. The 
measure of pubertal timing could 
be improved by having a trained 
third party (eg, nurses) assess 
pubertal development according to 
the Tanner stages.41 Nevertheless, 
the current findings held across an 
objective (ie, age at menarche) and 
a subjective measure of relative 
pubertal development, bolstering 
confidence in the results. Second, 
ADA was assessed in up to 3 
romantic relationships and up to 3 
nonromantic sexual relationships, 
which means that ADA could 
have been underdetected if some 
girls had abusive experiences in 
a seventh or eighth relationship 
that was not assessed. This seems 
unlikely, however, because none of 
the participants reported having 
had 6 relationships, only 1 reported 
having had 5 relationships, and 
67% reported that they had only 
1 romantic or sexual relationship. 
Third, the data analyzed in this study 
were from 20 years ago. The reason 
is that Add Health is the only study 
that collected peer network data as 
part of a nationally representative 
sample; there are not more recent 
data we could use.
cOnclusIOns
ADA is prevalent and consequential. 
In recent years, more prevention 
programs have been tested for 
middle school youth, 
42, 
 
43 because 
it has become clear that ADA is 
already prevalent by the time youth 
reach high school.44, 
 
45 However, the 
effects of these prevention programs 
are typically small and difficult to 
sustain. Biological indicators that a 
girl may be at increased risk for ADA 
are important for the field because 
they give pediatricians, parents, 
and others who work with youth a 
marker that should prompt extra 
conversation about the importance 
of healthy relationships. Our study 
provides 1 marker for increased risk 
for ADA among US girls that should 
be included in lists of risk factors and 
educational materials. Adolescents 
and their parents should be 
reassured that only some girls who 
make an early transition to puberty 
(32% as compared with 28% of the 
on-time and 27% of the late-maturing 
girls based on the subjective rating 
of pubertal timing; see Supplemental 
Information) experience dating 
abuse, but that it is nevertheless 
worthwhile to be vigilant with this 
group, particularly when these girls 
have a greater percentage of boys in 
their friendship groups. Continued 
study of the mechanisms underlying 
the linkage of early puberty, boy 
friends, and ADA may additionally 
enhance prevention efforts.
