Objective: This study examined whether worksite wellness program
participation or achievement of health improvement targets differed accord-
ing to four incentive types (participation-based, hybrid, outcome-based, and
no incentive). Methods: The study included individuals who completed
biometric health screenings in both 2013 and 2014 and had elevated metrics
in 2013 (baseline year). Multivariate logistic regression modeling tested for
differences in odds of participation and achievement of health improvement
targets between incentive groups; controlling for demographics, employer
characteristics, incentive amounts, and other factors. Results: No statisti-
cally significant differences between incentive groups occurred for odds of
participation or achievement of health improvement target related to body
mass index, blood pressure, or nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Conclusions: Given the null findings of this study, employers cannot assume
that outcome-based incentives will result in either increased program
participation or greater achievement of health improvement targets than
participation-based incentives.
BACKGROUND
T
he majority of employers with 200 or more employees offer
some form of employee wellness program.1 Incentives are
increasingly used within these programs1–3 to promote participation
and encourage individuals to take ownership of their health. Two
types of incentives are commonly applied: participation-based
incentives and outcome-based incentives. The latter make rewards
contingent on achieving health metrics in a healthy range (or
improved from a prior period).
There has been significant movement among employers
toward outcome-based incentives,2,4 though that trend may be
subsiding. A 2014 survey found that 22% of employers had out-
come-based incentives in 2014 and an additional 24% were con-
sidering implementing them in the future. A more recent survey
showed 24% of employers using outcome-based incentives in 2016
that represented a reduction from 42% and 44% in 2014 and 2015,
respectively.5 Despite the adoption of outcome-based incentives,
there is a paucity of published evidence from real-world settings
regarding the impact of outcome-based incentives on either
participation in employer-sponsored wellness programs or on
achieving health improvement targets.
Several factors have prompted interest in outcome-based
incentives. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(PPACA)6 as well as recently revised EEOC regulations7 permit
and provide guidance around the use of outcome-based wellness
incentives. In addition, outcome-based incentives are conceptually
similar to performance-based pay systems designed to align incen-
tives with a desired outcome. Although the desired outcome in a
pay-for-performance system is typically related to business goals
such as increased sales or improved client retention, the desired
outcome in an outcome-based wellness incentive is health status
improvement. Similar to a performance-based pay, one may hypoth-
esize that outcome-based incentives lead to greater personal
accountability for health status measures and might therefore lead
to more people meeting health improvement targets.
Existing literature includes evidence supporting the efficacy
of behavioral economics derived outcome-based incentive designs
using randomized experiments.8–10 Most studies do not include
evidence from real-world worksite implementation of outcome-
based incentives. In experimental settings, outcome-based incen-
tives have been shown to be associated with greater rates of tobacco
cessation than no incentive8,10 and have also been shown to be
associated with greater short-term weight loss than no incentive.9
Although these studies all relied on a type of outcome-based
incentive, the incentive designs tested were notably different than
those frequently used in worksite wellness settings, and the com-
parison groups received no incentive rather than an alternative
(participation-based) incentive. In the studies cited above, incen-
tives were awarded to individuals who successfully met change
targets (quit smoking or lost weight). In contrast, outcome-based
incentives in a typical employer setting are awarded to individuals
who meet a healthy measure target [eg, healthy body mass index
(BMI)] or a health improvement target (eg, 5% weight loss).
Individuals who do not meet the target at baseline are able to
pursue a reasonable alternative standard (RAS) to earn the incentive.
RAS are defined in the final rule regarding incentives for
Nondiscriminatory Wellness Programs in Group Health Plans.11
Employers in this study implemented a variety of RAS consisting of
wellness program participation and allowing for exceptions to be
granted where medically advisable. Some employers’ RAS required
completion of a specific number of telephonic coaching calls, but
most allowed individuals to participate in a wellness program of
their choosing. Individuals who missed established targets in a given
year had the opportunity to improve their health status sufficiently to
achieve established targets and earn incentives in future years.
In addition to the notable differences in outcome-based
incentives as studied and as implemented in a typical worksite
setting, there are limitations around how research-backed incentive
designs may be applied in a worksite setting. Implementation in
worksite settings requires accommodation of employee feedback,
development of feasible and efficient processes to administer the
incentive program, and application of programs across a range of
individuals who may not be willing to participate in a research

 study.12 In addition, participant trust in and attitudes toward their
employer may impact the way that a program works within a
worksite setting. Consequently, effectiveness of outcome-based
incentive designs in practice may differ from the efficacy measured
in experimental settings.
Existing studies have looked at participation-based incen-
tives associated with a single activity such as completion of a health
assessment questionnaire13,14 or participation in telephonic coach-
ing programs.15–18 Most of these studies use the employer as the
unit of analysis and examine variation in incentive availability or
incentive amounts offered against participation rates. Because these
studies use the employer rather than person as the unit of analysis,
they are unable to control for person-level differences. One study
examined whether employer plan characteristics, including incen-
tives, explained variation in estimated coefficients for age and
gender derived from person-level analyses within each employer.18
Their findings indicated that some employer-level characteristics
were correlated with the estimated coefficients from person-level
data. Another study conducted with a person-level unit of analysis
found that coaching program participation was more likely when a
participation-based incentive was offered than when no incentive
was offered, but completion rates were no different among partici-
pants whether or not an incentive was offered.17 This study sought to
address a gap in current published literature by examining whether
worksite wellness program participation or achievement of health
improvement targets differed according to different incentive
modalities.
This study compared the effects of participation-based and
outcome-based incentives in an employer wellness setting control-
ling for age, gender, and other person-level and employer-level
characteristics. Analyses were conducted on three analytic groups
consisting of individuals with repeat health screening values
approximately 12 months apart. The first group was composed
of individuals with elevated baseline BMI, the second of individuals
with elevated baseline blood pressure, and the third of individuals
with elevated baseline nonhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol values. Logistic regression was performed to examine the
effects of different incentive types on two outcomes: participation in
worksite wellness programs and achievement of health improve-
ment targets.
METHODS
Setting
The study was conducted among a group of employers who
contracted with a specific wellness provider in calendar year 2014.
Forty-eight employers from various industries, including manu-
facturing, finance and insurance, health care, and retail, were
represented in the study population. The wellness provider con-
tracted primarily with large self-insured employers in the United
States. The wellness provider offered individualized guidance and
choice of personalized wellness programs, including phone-based
health coaching, onsite in-person health coaching, online or mobile
digital coaching programs, and self-monitoring programs (trackers)
that synchronized self-entered data with data from approved apps
and wearable devices. The wellness provider supported a range of
different types of incentives including both participation-based and
outcome-based incentives.
Final incentive and program design decisions were made by
employers in collaboration with third-party benefit consultants and
wellness provider staff. Employers decided which health promotion
activities should be incented as well as how incentives would
function. Employers frequently split their populations into different
incentive groups on the basis of various characteristics. For
example, an employer may have offered one set of incentives to
employees and a different set of incentives to eligible dependents.
Analytic Samples
A cohort of individuals who completed a biometric health
screening in both 2013 and 2014 (N ¼ 121,908) was identified and
examined to understand the differential impact of participation-
based and outcome-based incentives. Screenings were performed by
clinical staff at onsite events, in community-based walk-in clinics,
or by individuals’ primary care providers. Analysis was conducted
on three groups of individuals with elevated baseline (2013
measure) BMI (�30 kg/m2 19) (n ¼ 36,611), blood pressure (systolic
�140 mm Hg or diastolic �90 mm Hg20) (n ¼ 15,962), or non-HDL
cholesterol (�160 mg/dL21) (n ¼ 26,729) for two reasons. First,
given a similar improvement, long-term health impacts were more
likely to accrue to individuals with elevated baseline measures than
to individuals with healthy baseline values. Second, in outcome-
based incentive models, elevated baseline groups were targeted for
compliance with RAS participation requirements. Individuals with
elevated baseline metrics did not earn the outcome-based incentive
based on their biometric values and were required to participate in
relevant wellness programs in order to earn the incentive. Individ-
uals who met the outcome-based incentive target earn the incentive
and may have had limited or no further incentive to participate in
programs. Tables 1 to 3 summarize available sample sizes in each
analytic sample as well as the distribution of model covariates by
each incentive type within each analytic sample.
Measures
Two dependent variables were used in analyses: participation
and achievement of a health improvement target. Both variables
were binary indicators. Program participation was defined as having
completed at least one program interaction beyond enrolling in a
program (eg, completed a phone coaching call, completed a step in
an online coaching program, or tracked physical activity on 1 day)
between health screening observations for all groups. Participation
requirements to earn incentives varied by employer, but earning all
available incentives in a participation-based incentive typically
involved multiple program interactions through one or more pro-
gram types. Meeting participation-based RAS in an outcome-based
incentive sometimes required participation in a specific program
type. The operational definition of participation was selected to
avoid favoring particular types of interactions or incentive types and
to be consistent with an intent-to-treat approach.
The operational definition of health status improvement
varied according to baseline risk group. Achievement of a health
improvement target was defined as a reduction of at least 5% of
baseline body weight in the BMI group; as reducing blood pressure
to less than 140/90 mm Hg for blood pressure group; and as a
reduction of at least 10% from baseline non-HDL cholesterol for the
non-HDL cholesterol group. In practice, health improvement targets
varied by employer and did not exist for employers using participa-
tion-based incentives. Common definitions were selected to be
representative of outcome-based incentive improvement targets
used by employers in the study.
As described earlier, the primary independent variable of
interest was incentive type. Incentives were classified into one of
four incentive types on the basis of inclusion of health contingent
elements in the incentive design. An element was a specific activity
or achievement that was associated with an incentive award.
Participation-based incentives had no health contingent elements,
but included incentives for participation in wellness programs.
Hybrid (partial outcome-based) incentives included health contin-
gent elements that were worth less than the total available outcome
and participation incentive amount. Outcome-based incentives con-
tained health contingent elements equal to the total available out-
come and participation incentive amount. No incentive indicated
that there were no incentives available for either health contingent
elements or for participation in wellness programs.

 Other independent variables were included in analyses to
control for potential confounding effects. These variables included
person-level demographics such as age, gender, and relation type
(employee or dependent), which were derived from eligibility files.
Median income and population density in an individual’s residential
zip code were matched from U.S. census data.22 Zip codes were
divided into deciles on the basis of both median income and
population density and individuals were assigned to the decile into
which their zip code fell. An indicator was included to show whether
an email address, by which communications could be sent to each
individual, was available. Employer-level variables included an
industry categorization, the number of health promotion program
communications that the employer sent per eligible employee, and a
continuous culture of health index. The culture of health index was
constructed as the proportion of employees who reported in the
health assessment that their employer ‘‘actively promotes the health
of employees.’’ Incentive attributes included as control variables
included the total incentive dollars available in a year for health
outcomes or program participation, as well as indicators for two
other incentive characteristics: rollover and ‘‘get what you earn.’’
The rollover flag indicated that individuals who earned above their
maximum in one period could roll excess incentive points over into
a subsequent period. The ‘‘get what you earn’’ flag indicated that an
individual could earn partial incentive dollars, whereas absence of
the flag indicated that an individual earned all of the incentives or
none at all.
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate relationships between incentive type and each
covariate were examined. Chi-squared tests were used to test for
correlations between the distributions of categorical covariates and
incentive type. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for

 differences in the means of continuous covariates between incentive
types.
Multivariate logistic regression models were used to esti-
mate the association between incentive type and both wellness
program participation and achievement of health improvement
targets in each analytic group in order to control for observed
differences in other covariates that may influence program
participation or health status improvement. The explanatory var-
iable of interest was incentive type. Participation-based incentives
were used as the reference group because this was the largest group
and was considered current practice. Control variables included in
each model were age, gender, relation type, median income in zip
code of residence, population density in zip code of residence,
availability of email communication, an employer-level count
of the number of promotional messages sent per employee,
employer industry, an employer-level culture index, dollar value
of incentives, and other incentive characteristics. Regression
models of achievement of health improvement targets included
program participation as a covariate. Each regression model
included a random effect for the incentive group. Standard errors
were estimated using bootstrapping with 400 repetitions to account
for clustering of individuals within incentive groups. Incentive
groups were used as the clustering variable because of differences
in how employers treat individuals in each incentive group. A
separate logistic regression model was estimated for both program
participation and achievement of health improvement targets
within each of the three elevated baseline measures groups yielding
a total of six regression results. Commonalities across regression
results for participation or health target achievement were high-
lighted as findings. All statistical analyses were conducted using
Stata 12.123 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and tested for
significance at the a ¼ 0.05 level.

 RESULTS
There were demographic differences between the four incen-
tive type groups. The most notable differences were observed
among the full outcome-based incentive group. This group was
significantly older, lived in lower income and more rural zip codes,
and was more likely to work in manufacturing than other groups.
The full outcome-based incentive group had more incentive dollars
available but was less likely to be able to roll over incentives or earn
partial incentives. Tables 1 to 3 summarize the full set of demo-
graphic comparisons by incentive type. Individuals with participa-
tory incentives were more likely to be female than other groups.
Overall wellness program participation rates were 53.4%
among the elevated baseline BMI group, 54.5% among the elevated
baseline non-HDL cholesterol group, and 51.8% among the elevated
baseline blood pressure group. About 18.4% of program participants
in the elevated baseline BMI group lost at least 5% of body weight.
Among program participants in the elevated baseline non-HDL
cholesterol group, 38.2% reduced their non-HDL cholesterol by at
least 10%. Among program participants in the elevated baseline
blood pressure group, 62.9% reduced their blood pressure to less
than 140/90 mm Hg.

 amounts were associated with greater odds of participation as were
female gender and the ability to receive email communications.
Eligible dependents exhibited lower odds of participating in
programs than employees. Participation was not associated with
baseline biometric values and only in the BMI sample was it
significantly associated with age. Participation was also not associ-
ated with the employer-level measure of the number of messages
sent or the employer-level culture index measure.
Odds of Achieving Health Improvement Targets
Table 5 summarizes estimated health improvement target
odds ratios for each incentive type controlling for other factors using
logistic regression. Again, no significant difference in the odds of
achieving health improvement targets was observed by incentive
type categories. Several factors that were associated with participa-
tion such as incentive amount and the ability to receive email
communications were not associated with achievement of improve-
ment targets. The program participation indicator was only signifi-
cantly associated with achieving improvement targets in the BMI
sample. Age and gender were consistently associated with achieve-
ment of health improvement targets. Females were more likely to
achieve health improvement targets. Age was consistently nonlinear
with reduced odds associated with age and slightly higher odds
associated with the age-squared term. Higher baseline measure
levels were associated with greater odds of health status improve-
ment in the BMI and non-HDL cholesterol samples but not in the
blood pressure sample.
DISCUSSION
This study offered a direct comparison of the effectiveness of
participation-based and outcome-based incentives in worksite well-
ness program settings. This study found that, among groups with
elevated baseline health status measures, there were no significant
differences in the odds of program participation among different
incentive types when controlling for communications, individual
demographics, and other incentive characteristics such as incentive
amounts. There was also no statistically significant difference in the
odds of health improvement between the various incentive types
when controlling for potential confounders.
As mentioned in the Introduction, outcome-based incentives
are conceptually similar to performance-based pay systems
designed to align incentives with a desired outcome. Although
the desired outcome in a pay-for-performance system is typically
related to business goals such as increased client retention, the
desired outcome in an outcome-based incentive model is health
status improvement. Several factors are required for effective pay-
for-performance systems24: 1) clearly defined performance objec-
tives; 2) well-communicated performance objectives; 3) individuals
possess the knowledge, skills, abilities, and self-efficacy to meet
performance objectives; and 4) aligning incentives with individuals’
value systems.
Applying these principles to outcome-based incentives illus-
trates several potential reasons that outcome-based incentives may
not be associated with greater participation or health improvement.
Employers using outcome-based incentives appear to have clearly
defined and communicated health targets, but individuals may or
may not agree with these targets or may not understand what to do to
reach them. In addition, employees may feel that the targets are
arbitrary and irrelevant to work performance (not aligned with
individual or organizational values). Employees may not possess
the knowledge, skills, abilities, and self-efficacy required to meet
established health status targets. There may be opportunities for
employers or wellness providers to better apply learning from the
pay-for-performance world to wellness incentives.
In addition, the presence of RAS may have dampened effects
of outcome-based incentives. RAS in the study population consisted
largely of participation in a wellness program. Given the RAS,
outcome-based incentives are effectively participation-based for
those who do not meet established targets at baseline (the population
of interest in this study). In this light, it may be unsurprising that no
difference was observed. This differs from the expectations of many
employers who view outcome-based incentives as analogous to
performance-based pay and expect greater accountability and there-
fore better outcomes.
Several of the estimated odds ratios appear to be counter-
intuitive. Holding all other factors constant, no significant associ-
ation was observed between the client-level culture index and
worksite wellness program participation. The directionality of
estimated odds ratios suggested that higher culture scores were
associated with slightly lower odds of wellness program participa-
tion, whereas other studies have found positive associations between
culture and wellness program participation.13,14,17 This discrepancy
may be, at least in part, to the conceptualization of culture as a
shared perception of employer support. It may also be the case that
the employer-level shared perception captured in the variable was
not representative of the study population, those who had repeat
biometric health screenings and elevated baseline metrics.
Another example of a seemingly nonintuitive finding is the
lack of correlation between the number of messages sent per eligible
participant and wellness program participation. The ability to
communicate to an individual via email was associated with a
greater likelihood of wellness program participation, but the
employer-level number of communications sent per eligible partici-
pant was not. This may be due to the way communications were
targeted. Lack of prior participation was a common criterion used to
determine who should receive additional communications. Individ-
uals who participated early in the program year likely would have
received fewer messages than otherwise similar individuals who did
not participate or who postponed participation.
The no-incentive group showed higher odds of program
participation than other incentive types, though not significantly
so. This may be due to the focus of the analytic sample on individuals
who had completed health screenings in 2 consecutive years and had
an elevated baseline metric. Individuals who were motivated enough
to complete screenings in both years without having incentives in
place may have been more self-motivated than other groups that had
incentives in place. It should also be noted that nonincented groups in
the study population typically consisted of spouses or non-benefit
enrolled individuals who may not the primary target of the program,
but may be aware of available offerings. This suggests caution in
generalizing these findings beyond a repeat screening population and
indicates a need for future work explicitly modeling selection into the
repeat screening cohort.
Although this study was not designed to evaluate whether
worksite wellness programs lead to behavior change or health
improvement outcomes, the estimated odds ratio on the participa-
tion covariate hints that they may. For all three samples, the odds
ratio was greater than one, though it was only significantly greater
than one in the elevated BMI estimation sample. The very broad
definition of participation, at least one interaction regardless
of program focus or intended outcome, is likely insufficient to
estimate program effects. Future work should examine a range of
participation definitions.
Limitations
There are limitations to the current study that should be
noted. This analysis was not intended to evaluate the effectiveness
of health improvement programs, but rather to examine whether
there was any differential impact in the presence of outcome-based
incentives or participation-based incentives. This analysis relies on
a 1-year observation period. It is possible that differential impacts of
various types of incentives may become apparent over a longer time

 horizon. Future work looking at longer time periods is needed to
determine whether differences emerge over time.
This analysis relied on data from a narrow set of individuals
who chose to complete two biometric health screenings and who had
baselinevaluesabove a particular level. Reliance ona self-selectedset
of repeat screening participants limits the generalizability offindings.
Additional modeling to explicitly account for this selection effect
would be valuable. Another factor that may limit generalizability is
that all data were drawn from a single wellness provider. Reliance on
data from a single wellness provider may not only result in more
consistent incentive and participation data but may also limit general-
izability. Future work should examine whether outcome-based incen-
tives are more effective among specific populations, in specific
settings, or when particular conditions are present. For example,
individuals who have healthy metrics at baseline may respond more
positively to outcome-based incentives than individuals who are
outside of recommended ranges at program onset.
There are also several limitations to the measures that were
available for this study. The measure of culture used for this study
captures the degree to which employees share a perception that their
employer ‘‘actively promotes the health of employees.’’ This is
conceptually different than most other culture measures, but is the
only measure that was available for the timeframe of this study.
Future work should examine how well this correlates with other
culture measures. Another limitation relates to the inability to
control for differences in motivation or stages of change. These
measures were not available for the study period. Future work
should consider whether motivation or stages of change are
impacted by outcome-based incentives and whether controlling
for differences in motivation could yield different estimates of
the impact of outcome-based incentives.
Definitions of health improvement targets and participation
used in the study represent another potential limitation. The health
improvement target definitions were selected to be representative of
those used by study employers, but they do not match exactly what
was in place for each employer. Future work should consider
whether the health improvement targets selected might impact
the effectiveness of outcome-based incentives. Likewise, the defi-
nition of participation was intentionally chosen to be broadly
consistent with an intent-to-treat approach. Future work should
examine whether outcome-based incentives might have a differen-
tial impact on the quantity or quality of participation achieved.
CONCLUSION
When person-level demographics, communications, culture,
incentive amounts, and other incentive characteristics were con-
trolled for, no difference in program participation or the achieve-
ment of health improvement targets was observed between
participation-based and outcome-based incentives. Current policy
and employer interest in outcome-based incentives is based on
assumptions that linking incentives directly to outcomes of interest
will be more effective than linking incentives to participation that
may lead to that same outcome. This study does not definitively
support nor disprove that hypothesis. Future work is needed to
understand more completely the impacts of outcome-based wellness
incentives and the conditions and settings in which outcome-based
incentives may be most effective.
