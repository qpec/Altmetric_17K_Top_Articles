abstract
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiologic characteristics and outcomes of exposures to 
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), nicotine, and tobacco products among young children in 
the United States.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of exposures associated with nicotine and tobacco 
products among children younger than 6 years old was conducted by using National Poison 
Data System data.
RESULTS: From January 2012 through April 2015, the National Poison Data System received 
29 141 calls for nicotine and tobacco product exposures among children younger than 
6 years, averaging 729 child exposures per month. Cigarettes accounted for 60.1% of 
exposures, followed by other tobacco products (16.4%) and e-cigarettes (14.2%). The 
monthly number of exposures associated with e-cigarettes increased by 1492.9% during 
the study period. Children <2 years old accounted for 44.1% of e-cigarette exposures, 
91.6% of cigarette exposures, and 75.4% of other tobacco exposures. Children exposed 
to e-cigarettes had 5.2 times higher odds of a health care facility admission and 2.6 times 
higher odds of having a severe outcome than children exposed to cigarettes. One death 
occurred in association with a nicotine liquid exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of exposures to e-cigarettes and nicotine liquid among young 
children is increasing rapidly and severe outcomes are being reported. Swift government 
action is needed to regulate these products to help prevent child poisoning. Prevention 
strategies include public education; appropriate product storage and use away from 
children; warning labels; and modifications of e-cigarette devices, e-liquid, and e-liquid 
containers and packaging to make them less appealing and less accessible to children.

Exposure to E-Cigarettes, Nicotine, and Tobacco Products 
in the United States. Pediatrics. 2016;137(6):e20160041
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: E-cigarettes 
were introduced in the US marketplace in 2007. Calls 
to poison control centers related to this product 
have increased substantially since then, with most 
exposures occurring among young children.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Child exposure to 
e-cigarettes increased by ~1500% during the 
40-month study period. Children exposed to 
e-cigarettes had 5.2 times higher odds of health 
care facility admission and 2.6 times higher odds of 
severe medical outcomes than children exposed to 
cigarettes.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
are battery-operated devices that 
deliver nicotine, flavorings, and other 
chemicals through an inhaled aerosol. 
E-cigarette product manufacturers 
market their product as a safer 
alternative to traditional cigarettes.1 
E-cigarettes that are marketed 
without a therapeutic claim are not 
subject to regulation by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).2
The e-cigarette industry has 
expanded since the product entered 
the US marketplace in 2007, with 
total sales predicted to approach $10 
billion by 2017.3 This expansion is 
associated with a rapid rise in the use 
of e-cigarettes among US adults and 
adolescents.4–6 Use of e-cigarettes 
tripled among high school students 
from 2013 to 2014.6
Among the combined e-cigarette 
and cigarette exposure calls to US 
Poison Control Centers (PCCs), the 
proportion of e-cigarette exposures 
increased from 0.3% in September 
2010 to 41.7% in February 2014.2 
This surge is of concern because 
more than half of the exposures 
associated with e-cigarettes occurred 
among children <6 years and because 
nicotine can be fatal to young 
children.2, 
7
Despite the rapid increases in 
e-cigarette use and pediatric 
exposures, an analysis that focuses 
exclusively and comprehensively 
on the trends associated with 
exposures among young children 
nationally has not been published. 
To our knowledge, this is the first 
comprehensive multiyear study of 
e-cigarette, nicotine, and tobacco 
exposures among young children 
using a national database.
METHODS
Data Source
The American Association of 
Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) 
maintains the National Poison Data 
System (NPDS), which captures 
data regarding calls to US PCCs on 
a near real-time basis.8 These PCCs 
receive calls for exposures to a 
variety of substances through the 
Poison Help Line 24 hours per day, 
offer medical advice, and document 
reported events in the database. 
Extensive quality control measures 
are used to ensure the accuracy and 
completeness of the data collected.9 
This report is a retrospective analysis 
of data obtained from the NPDS.
Case Selection Criteria
NPDS data for single substance 
exposures reported to poison 
control centers involving nicotine 
and tobacco products (listed in the 
Supplemental Table 4) from January 
1, 2012, to April 30, 2015, among 
children <6 years were requested 
from the AAPCC and analyzed; the 
AAPCC Micromedex Joint Coding 
Group’s AAPCC generic substance 
coding system was used to identify 
these substances.10
Exposures that occurred outside of 
the 50 US states and the District of 
Columbia or occurred at a health 
care facility (HCF) or “other” location 
(including nursing home and prison) 
were excluded from the study. Calls 
to PCCs in which the outcome was 
a confirmed nonexposure or an 
unrelated effect were excluded. Calls 
for which the reason of exposure 
was an adverse reaction (to a drug or 
another substance), abuse, misuse, 
malicious, unintentional misuse, 
unintentional therapeutic error, or an 
unknown reason (both unintentional 
and otherwise) or calls involving 
individuals older than 5 years also 
were excluded.
Study Variables
Study variables included implicated 
substance, month and year of 
exposure, state in which the exposure 
occurred, child age and gender, event 
scenario, exposure route, exposure 
site, management site, level of health 
care received, outcome, duration and 
type of clinical effects, and therapy 
performed.
According to NPDS definitions, (1) 
minor effects included minimally 
bothersome symptoms, typically 
limited to the skin and mucus 
membranes, which generally 
resolved rapidly with no residual 
disability or disfigurement; (2) 
moderate effects included non–life-
threatening symptoms that were 
more prolonged or systemic in 
nature than minor symptoms with no 
residual disability or disfigurement, 
and usually, some form of treatment 
is indicated; and (3) major effects 
included symptoms that were 
life-threatening or resulted in 
major disability or disfigurement.8 
For subanalyses, outcomes were 
classified as severe (including death, 
major effects, and moderate effects) 
and other (including minor and no 
effect, unable to follow-up, and not 
followed-up).
The implicated substances were 
grouped into e-cigarettes (including 
nicotine device and nicotine liquid), 
cigarettes, other tobacco products 
(including chewing tobacco, cigars, 
dissolvable tobacco, filter tips only, 
and snuff), and unknown types 
of tobacco products. States were 
classified into 4 US regions (West, 
Midwest, Northeast, and South) 
per Census Bureau definitions.11 
Exposure route was grouped into 
ingestion, multiple routes with 
ingestion (including ingestion 
combined with ≥1 of dermal, ocular, 
inhalation/nasal, other, unknown, 
and aspiration with ingestion), 
dermal, inhalation/nasal, ocular, or 
other (including dermal combined 
with ocular or inhalation/nasal, otic, 
and other), and unknown. Exposure 
site was grouped into residence 
(including the patient’s own or other 
residence), nonresidence (including 
public area, restaurant/food service, 
school, or workplace), and unknown.

Statistical Analysis and Ethical 
Statement
Data analysis was conducted by 
using SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, 
NY) and SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC). Annual and state-specific 
exposure rates were calculated by 
using US Census Bureau population 
estimates.12 Inspection of the 
plots (Fig 1) of monthly cigarette 
and monthly overall tobacco and 
nicotine product exposures reveals 
a quadratic seasonal trend that 
peaks during the summer months. 
Linear regression with seasonal 
components (month and month-
squared terms) was used to evaluate 
trends for these exposures. On the 
other hand, monthly e-cigarette 
and monthly other tobacco product 
exposures exhibit a quadratic trend 
over the entire study period. Linear 
regression with a quadratic term 
was used to evaluate trends for these 
exposures. Simple logistic regression 
was used to compare various 
outcome measures between different 
types of tobacco and nicotine 
products. One model was used for 
each outcome measure (severe 
medical outcomes, HCF admission, 
and clinical effects) by using types of 
tobacco and nicotine products as the 
predictors. Odds ratios (ORs) with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
calculated by using e-cigarettes as the 
reference group. Unknown type of 
tobacco product was excluded from 
these analyses. Statistical significance 
was established at α = 0.05. This 
study was judged to be exempt by 
the institutional review board of the 
Research Institute at Nationwide 
Children's Hospital.
RESULTS
General Characteristics and Trends
From January 2012 through April 
2015, the NPDS received 29 141 calls 
for nicotine and tobacco product 
exposures among children <6 years, 
averaging 729 children per month. 
Cigarettes accounted for 60.1% of the 
exposures, e-cigarettes for 14.2%, 
and other tobacco products for 
16.4% (Table 1). Chewing tobacco 
(67.3%) and snuff (25.0%) accounted 
for most of the other tobacco product 
exposures. Thirty-nine percent of 
exposures occurred in the Southern 
region of the United States (Table 1). 
Most children were exposed through 
ingestion (95.5%) or multiple routes 
including ingestion (2.8%), and 
only 1.7% through noningestion 
routes. However, 8.6% of e-cigarette 
exposures occurred through 
noningestion routes. The scenario 
associated with children’s access to 
the nicotine and tobacco products 
was recorded for 1495 (5.1%) 
exposures. Of these exposures, the 
product was stored within sight of 
the child in 44.8%, was always left 
out in 10.2%, and was temporarily 
open while in use in 8.6% (Table 1).
More than three-quarters (79.6%) of 
exposed children were <2 years. The 
median age of exposed children was 
1.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 
0.8–1.7). The median age of exposed 
children varied by substance: 2.0 
years (IQR 1.4–2.0) for e-cigarettes, 
1.0 years (IQR 0.8–1.3) for cigarettes, 
and 1.3 years (IQR 1.0–1.9) for other 
tobacco products. Children <2 years 
accounted for 44.1% of e-cigarette 
exposures, 91.6% of cigarette 
exposures, and 75.4% of other 
tobacco exposures (Table 1). Boys 
accounted for 56.1% of all exposures, 
and the proportion of boys exposed 
increased with age from 53.4% 
among children <1 year to 64.3% 
among children 5 years old.
The monthly number of nicotine 
and tobacco product exposures, 
while adjusting for a seasonal trend, 
increased significantly (P < .01) by 
73.2% from 563 in January 2012 
to 975 in April 2015. This increase 
was driven by a significant (P = 
.04) quadratic increase in monthly 
e-cigarette exposures, which rose 
by 1492.9% from January 2012 
(14 exposures) through April 2015 
(223 exposures) (Fig 1). During 
the same time period, there was no 
significant increase in the monthly 
number of cigarette exposures 
adjusted for a seasonal trend (P = 
.08) and no significant quadratic 
increase in the monthly number of 
other noncigarette tobacco product 
exposures (P = .18).
The annual rate of nicotine and 
tobacco product exposure per 10 000 
children <6 years increased by 40.3% 
from 3.0 in 2012 to 4.2 in 2014. The 
exposure rate was highest in the 
Midwest region (4.2), and Wyoming 
was the state with the highest rate 
(8.3) (Fig 2).

Management Site, Level of Health 
Care Received, and Outcome
Approximately three-quarters 
(75.9%) of exposed children were 
managed on site (not at an HCF; 
usually at home), 16.6% were 
treated/evaluated and released 
from an HCF, 0.4% were admitted 
to a noncritical care unit, and 0.2% 
were admitted to a critical care unit 
(Table 2). Compared with children 
exposed to cigarettes or other 
tobacco products, those exposed 
to e-cigarettes were more often 
referred to an HCF by PCCs (23.4%), 
already in or en route to an HCF 
when the PCC was called (21.2%), 
and treated/evaluated and released 
(34.8%) (Table 2). Children exposed 
to e-cigarettes also had higher odds 
of being admitted to an HCF than 
children exposed to cigarettes (OR 
5.19, 95% CI 3.60–7.48) or other 
tobacco products (OR 4.69, 95% CI 
2.71–8.12). There were no significant 
differences in the odds of HCF 
admission between those exposed 
to cigarettes compared with those 
exposed to other tobacco products 
(OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52–1.58).

Among all children exposed to 
nicotine or tobacco products, 35.8% 
experienced no clinical effects, 
whereas 1.2% suffered severe 
outcomes (Table 2). One death to a 
1-year-old child occurred associated 
with nicotine liquid accessed from 
an open refill container. Children 
exposed to e-cigarettes (OR 2.60, 
95% CI 1.96–3.46) or other tobacco 
products (OR 3.05, 95% CI 2.35–
3.96) had higher odds of having 
a severe outcome than children 
exposed to cigarettes. There was no 
significant difference in the odds of 
having a severe outcome between 
those exposed to e-cigarettes and 
those exposed to other (noncigarette) 
tobacco products (OR 0.85, 95% CI 
0.85–1.36).
Clinical Effects and Therapies
Among all exposures, 27.5% of 
children developed ≥1 clinical 
effects related to the exposure. The 
most common clinical effect was 
vomiting (22.0%) (Table 3). The 
odds of having ≥1 clinical effect were 
higher among children exposed to 
e-cigarettes than among children 
exposed to cigarettes (OR 1.20, 95% 
CI 1.11–1.30). Serious clinical effects 
were less common and occurred 
among children <3 years; they 
included asystole/cardiac arrest 
(n = 1), coma (n = 6), single seizure 
(n = 6), and respiratory arrest (n = 3). 
The asystole/cardiac arrest was 
associated with the fatality; the 
other serious clinical effects were 
associated with other nonfatal 
exposures. Duration of clinical effects 
was documented for 6242 (21.4%) 
exposures; of these, 72.6% of the 
clinical effects persisted for ≤2 hours 
(Table 2).
One or more therapies were 
performed on 62.6% of the exposed 
children; dilution/irrigation/wash 
(56.4%) and food/snack (13.2%) 
were used most frequently.
DISCUSSION
From January 2012 through April 
2015, US PCCs received >29 000 
reports of nicotine and tobacco 
exposures among children <6 years. 
Most of the exposures resulted in 
minimal toxicity. Although most 
exposures were to traditional 
cigarettes, e-cigarette exposures were 
more often serious than cigarette 
exposures. Children exposed to 
e-cigarettes had 5.2 times higher 
odds of being admitted to an HCF 
and 2.6 times higher odds of having 
a severe outcome, compared with 
those exposed to cigarettes. There 
was 1 death associated with nicotine 
liquid exposure.13, 
14 The potential 
for toxic exposure among young 
children is heightened by the lack 
of regulation and standardization 
of nicotine concentration in 
e-cigarette cartridges and refill 
solutions.7 E-liquid refill containers 
are commonly available with 
nicotine concentrations of 6, 12, 18, 
24, and 36 mg/mL (among other 
concentrations) for direct use, and 
base concentrations up to 100 mg/
mL that are diluted before use.15 The 
most common routes associated with 
e-cigarette exposure were ingestion 
alone, multiple routes with ingestion, 
and dermal, which agrees with a 
previous study.16 This is of concern 
because the greatest risk of toxicity 
or fatality in the pediatric population 
is when e-liquid is ingested or 
absorbed transdermally.7
During the study period, the monthly 
number of exposures associated with 
e-cigarettes increased by ∼1500%. 
This significant increase can largely 
be attributed to the increasing use 
of these products. In January 2014, 
there were 466 e-cigarette brands 
and 7764 flavors of nicotine liquid 
available online, having increased 
by 10.5 e-cigarette brands and 
242 flavors per month during the 
previous 17 months.4 From 2010 
to 2013, awareness of e-cigarette 
products increased from 40.9% 
to 79.7%, while both ever use and 
current use more than doubled 
among US adults.5 As the household 
presence of e-cigarettes and their 
liquid nicotine refill products has 
increased, so has exposure among 
young children.17
Contrary to the trends observed 
for e-cigarettes, the monthly

number of exposures among young 
children to cigarettes did not change 
significantly over the study period. 
This is partly due to the decline in 
cigarette use during the study period, 
which contrasts with the increase 
in use of e-cigarettes. During 2002 
to 2012, cigarette sales declined 
from 96.9 to 59.9 cigarette packs 
per capita, and self-reported current 
cigarette use also decreased.18 
On the other hand, there was a 
significant increase in the sale of 
cigars (from 30.5 to 57.4 cigars per 
capita), loose tobacco (from 2.5 to 
5.6 cigarette pack equivalents per 
capita), and moist snuff (from 10.6 
to 14.6 cigarette pack equivalents 
per capita) among US adults from 
2002 to 2012, 
18 but there was no 
significant increase in the monthly 
exposures associated with other 
tobacco products (primarily chewing 
tobacco and snuff) during the study 
period. Although cigarette and other 
tobacco product exposures among 
young children did not increase, the 
continued high frequency of exposure 
remains an important problem.
Young children are at risk for 
ingestion because of their curiosity 
and tendency for oral exploration.19, 
20 
As they get older and their taste 
discrimination matures, they may be 
more attracted to flavored tobacco 
products.21 Under the Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, 
a ban was implemented in 2009 on 
cigarettes with characterizing flavors 
other than menthol and tobacco, 
including fruit- and candy-flavored 
cigarettes.22 Currently, no such ban 
exists on e-cigarettes and other 
tobacco products. The plethora of 
added flavors, colorful packaging, 
and candylike appearance associated 
with e-cigarette devices and their 
liquid refill products, as well as other 
tobacco products, may make them 
more attractive to young children.7, 
23 
With increasing mobility and 
dexterity, toddlers are also able 
to access and open liquid nicotine 
refill containers, which currently

generally lack child-resistant closures 
and often contain potentially lethal 
amounts of nicotine for a toddler. 
These developmental changes in 
taste discrimination, mobility, and 
dexterity may help explain the slightly 
greater median age of exposure 
for e-cigarettes (2.0 years) and 
other tobacco products (1.3 years) 
compared with cigarettes (1.1 years).
Prevention
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
issued 3 policy statements in 
November 2015 on public policy 
to protect children from tobacco, 
nicotine, and tobacco smoke 
and electronic nicotine delivery 
systems.24–26 These statements 
offer recommendations to reduce 
youth access to e-cigarettes, e-liquid, 
and related products, including 
unintentional exposure among young 
children.
The FDA issued an advanced notice 
of proposed rulemaking in June 
2015, inviting public comment to 
help inform potential regulatory 
actions by the FDA with respect 
to nicotine exposure warnings 
and child-resistant packaging for 
liquid nicotine, nicotine-containing 
e-liquids, and other tobacco 
products.27 In response, the AAP and 
>40 other organizations dedicated to 
protecting children from harm from 
tobacco products provided comments 
that included the following potential 
regulatory measures: requiring child-
resistant packaging and appropriate 
warning labels for e-cigarette 
products; requiring child-resistant 
closures and flow restrictors on 
e-liquid refill containers; restricting

the use of packaging and labeling 
attractive to children (eg, images of 
popular child food products, fruit, 
and candy are currently used); 
prohibiting the use of flavors (eg, 
bubblegum, cotton candy, and 
popular candy flavors are currently 
used); limiting the concentration of 
nicotine in e-liquid and the quantity 
of e-liquid in refill containers; 
and ensuring that activation 
mechanisms and the e-liquid tanks/
compartments on e-cigarette devices 
are child-resistant.28
Federal legislation, the Child Nicotine 
Poisoning Prevention Act, was 
signed into law in January 2016 that 
requires child-resistant packaging 
for e-liquid containers.29 Similar 
legislation has been adopted by 16 
states, including 4 states in 2014 and 
12 states in 2015.30
In addition to adopting new 
public policy and modifications of 
e-cigarettes, e-liquid, and e-liquid 
refill containers, educational efforts 
and public awareness may help 
prevent nicotine exposures among 
young children. The most frequently 
reported scenario of access was the 
product being stored within sight of 
the child, followed by the product 
always being left out and the product 
being temporarily open. Therefore, 
education of e-cigarette users and 
child caregivers should emphasize 
that e-cigarettes and associated 
products should be stored out of 
sight and reach of children in a locked 
location, and should not be accessible 
to children when in use. Educating 
child caregivers about potential 
clinical effects and outcomes 
associated with nicotine exposure 
may help motivate adoption of safety 
behaviors and aid in identification 
of symptoms in the event of an 
exposure. Adults in households 
with children <6 years should be 
counseled on vaping cessation and 
strongly encouraged not to use 
or store e-cigarettes, e-liquid, and 
related products in the home.
Limitations
This study has limitations. Our study 
analyzed NPDS data, which captures 
only cases voluntarily reported to 
PCCs, and therefore underestimates 
the frequency of pediatric exposures 
associated with nicotine and tobacco 
products. There is also potential 
reporting bias among physicians, 
who might be more inclined to report 
exposure to a new product, such as 
e-cigarettes, than a long-established 
product, such as cigarettes. In 
addition, the accuracy of reports 
cannot be completely verified by 
PCCs or the AAPCC. Data miscoding 
by PCC poison specialists attending to 
a call is another potential limitation. 
Reported exposures do not 
necessarily represent a poisoning or 
overdose. Despite these limitations, 
the NPDS provides a comprehensive, 
standardized national database on 
exposures to many substances. It is 
the most comprehensive data source 
for the investigation of nicotine and 
tobacco exposures among young 
children in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS
The frequency of exposures to 
e-cigarettes and nicotine liquid 
among young children reported to 
US PCCs is rising rapidly. Children 
exposed to e-cigarette devices and 
nicotine liquid are >2.5 times more 
likely to have a severe outcome 
than children exposed to cigarettes, 
and lethal exposure has occurred. 
Swift government action is needed 
to regulate these products to help 
prevent child poisoning. Prevention 
strategies include public education; 
appropriate product storage and use 
away from children; warning labels; 
and modifications of e-cigarette 
devices, e-liquid, and e-liquid 
containers and packaging to make 
them less appealing and accessible to 
children.
