Abstract: Engineering of neuronal network geometry by micropatterning technology is a key future
technology for creating artificial brains on a chip. However, engineering of network geometry at
the single-cell-level with functional morphology (axon/dendrite) and connectivity (synapses) is still
challenging. Here, we describe a method for controlling the axon and dendrite morphology of single
primary-cultured neurons and assembling a neural circuit using mobile microplates. The microplates
enabled morphological control of neurons by their shapes and bringing their ends into contact caused
the formation of physical connections. Functional synapse formation at the connection was indicated
by immunostaining of synapse-related proteins and intracellular Ca2+ imaging of neural activity.
We believe that the method will be useful in engineering neural circuits with selected neurons and
defined morphology.

1. Introduction
The brain, the sophisticated biological information processor in a living organism, is
fundamentally constructed as a neuronal network, an assembly of a hundred billion cell bodies
connected by elongated axons and dendrites [1]. Anatomical and functional investigation of this
complex neuronal network is extremely difficult in vivo [2]. In vitro models of the network serve
as critical research tools due to their simplicity of network structure and the controllability of their
physical and chemical environments [3].
Micropatterning
technologies
including
lithography,
molding,
laser
structuring
are
recently developed tools for preparation and control of in vitro neuronal networks [4–11].
Micropatterning technologies enable manipulation of physical and chemical guidance cues for
cultured neurons, e.g., cell-sized barriers or trenches for guiding axon and dendrite growth [12],
and micropatterned protein-based islands for guiding the location of cell bodies [13]. With these tools
a researcher can design a set of guidance cues and thereby determine the geometry of the neuronal
network [14]. Researchers have found three important neuronal behaviors relating to micropatterns:
(i) When a neuron is seeded on a cell-adhesive circular micropattern with several protruding lines,
the cell body of the neuron tends to adhere to the circle and its neuronal processes (axon and dendrites)
tend to grow along the lines [15,16]; (ii) When neurons are seeded on an array of circles connected by
lines, the positions of the cell bodies and neuronal processes (that is, the geometry of the neuronal
network) are roughly determined by the circles and lines respectively [17,18]; (iii) The lengths
of linear micropatterns influence differentiation of axons and dendrites from immature neuronal

processes [19,20]. By utilizing the behavior of neurons on circle and line micropatterns, it is possible
to design a neuronal network geometry, and thereby to construct an artificially designed brain on a
chip. A significant drawback of the technique is that the success rate of positioning and connection are
not 100% (less than 10% in practice), due to the variability of growth and the immobility of neurons
in culture [21]. As a consequence, full control over neuronal network geometry at the single-cell
level is virtually impossible. One possible approach to solving the problem is, as we previously
reported [22], to mobilize micropatterned single neurons by attaching them to movable microplates.
Recently we have demonstrated that a circular- or linear-shaped microplate can control the positions
of the cell bodies and neurites of single neuron-like cells (PC12 cells), and their positions can be
changed on demand during culture by micro-manipulating the microplates. This technique allows for
the positioning of cell bodies and neurites to desired locations with 100% certainty, and thus forms
a promising approach to the creation of fully controlled neuronal networks at the single-cell level.
However, since the PC12 neuron-like cells did not have specification of axon and dendrites, and did
not have synaptic connection, it was unclear whether the microplate technique can be used to form
functional neuronal networks.
In this paper, we investigate the next step in the microplate-based neuronal network formation
technique, namely control of functional axon and dendrite formation on the microplates and functional
synaptic connection between the neurons. Since PC12 cells do not have functional axons, dendrites and
synapses, we employ rat primary-cultured hippocampal neurons and newly designed microplates composed
of a circle and protruding long and short arms (Figure 1). We expect the cell bodies of hippocampal neurons
to attach to the circular areas (Cell body parts), the axons to grow along the long arms (Axon parts),
and the dendrites to grow along the short arms (Dendrite parts). The microplates have a biocompatible
sacrificial layer underneath for further detachment and manipulation, and are massively arrayed on a
non-cell-adhesive background to allow for the stochastic capture of single neurons on the microplates.
We first examine whether the long and short arms of microplates can control the differentiation of axons
and dendrites. We then assemble the cultured neurons on the microplates using a micro-manipulator,
and investigate whether synaptic connections form.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Design of Mobile Microplates
We designed the microplates to have a central Cell body part consisting of a 30 µm-diameter
circle, a long Axon part consisting of a 100 µm straight line, and one to three short Dendrite parts
consisting of 20 µm lines. The thickness of the microplate was 2 µm. Microplates were arrayed
on glass with 100 µm gaps in the x and y directions. The surface of the glass was covered with
cell-repulsive 2-methacryloyloxyethyl-phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymer [23] to pattern neurons only
on the microplates. The microplates were composed of three layers: a gelatin sacrificial layer for
detachment of the microplate from the glass after cell culture, a 2 µm transparent parylene layer for
adhesion and manipulation of neurons, and a laminin cell-adhesive layer for promoting neuronal
adhesion. The gelatin was biocompatible and denatured during culture at 37 ◦C to enable detachment
of the parylene layer by pushing with a glass capillary [22]. The parylene layer was biocompatible and
enabled phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy of the cells [22]. Laminin was chosen for its affinity
to primary hippocampal neurons.
2.2. Fabrication of Mobile Microplates
We fabricated the mobile microplates by a photolithography process using a protein
micropatterning technique (Figure 2a). The fabrication process was slightly modified from our previous
report [22]. First, we cleaned the surface of 120–170 µm-thick glass by acetone and isopropanol washing,
treated it with O2 plasma for hydrophilization, and spin-coated 0.01% (w/v) gelatin (from porcine skin,
type A, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 2000 rpm for 30 s on the glass. After dehydrating in a
vacuum chamber for more than 2 h, 2–3 µm thick parylene C (DPX-C, Speedline Technology, Franklin,
MA, USA) and aluminum (Al) were deposited. A photoresist layer (S1818, Shipley, Marlborough,
MA, USA) was patterned to the microplate shapes using photolithography, then the exposed Al layer
was chemically etched by 2.38% tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide solution (NMD-3, Tokyo Ohka
Kogyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Exposed Parylene C and gelatin layers were dry-etched by O2 plasma.
MPC solutions (provided by Prof. K. Ishihara of the University of Tokyo) were spin-coated at
2000 rpm for 30 s followed by drying under an ethanol atmosphere for 20 min, and baked at
70 ◦C for 4 h. Before cell culture, the Al and MPC polymers were removed from the microplates
by NMD-3, and the device was placed in a 35 mm-diameter glass dish. Laminin (L2020, Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved for 2 µg/mL concentration in a basal salt solution composed of
130 mM NaCl (Wako, Osaka, Japan), 5.4 mM KCl (Wako), 1.8 mM CaCl2 (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo,
Japan), 5.5 mM D-glucose (Kanto Chemical), 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES, Wako) of pH 7.4, and coated to the surface of the device for 100 µL/cm2, incubated for 4 h
in a humidified 37 ◦C incubator, and washed with phosphate buffer saline without MgCl2 and CaCl2
(PBS, Sigma) four times. Then 2 mL of Neurobasal medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2% B27 (Gibco,
Waltham, MA, USA), 1% GlutaMAX (Gibco), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was poured
in the dish, and incubated in a humidified 37 ◦C incubator.
We confirmed that the fabricated microplates were as designed by SEM observation (Figure 2b).
To investigate whether laminin layers were formed only on the microplates, we immunostained for
laminin using rabbit polyclonal anti-laminin primary antibody (AB11575, Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
and secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor488 (A-11008, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA)
(Figure 2c). Laminin was detected only on the microplates. We concluded that the micropatterning of
the laminin was a result of the anti-protein absorption function of the MPC polymers on the glass.

2.3. Cell Culture 
E16-20 rat primary hippocampal cells were obtained by a standard protocol [24]. All rats were 
treated in accordance with the policies of the University of Tokyo Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. Primary hippocampal cells were seeded on the microplates at 1.5 × 102 cells/mm2 and cultured 
in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The 
medium was changed after 1 day to remove unattached cells. The medium was routinely replaced 
once a week. 
2.4. Gene Manipulation 
Primary hippocampal neurons on microplates were genetically manipulated by adeno-
associated virus vectors to express green fluorescent protein (GFP, AV-9-PV1917, Penn Vector Core) 
or GCaMP6 (intracellular Ca2+ indicator, AV-1-PV2822, Penn Vector Core) under the control of a 
neuron-specific promoter. A solution of virus vectors was added to the culture medium, and the 
infected neurons on the microplates were observed after 1 day. 
2.5. Immunostaining of Neurons on Microplates 
Neurons were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako) for 1 h, permeabilized with 0.5% 
TritonX100 (Alfa Aesar, Lancashire, UK) for 6 min, and incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, 
Sigma) for 1 h. The fixed cells were treated with mouse monoclonal anti-Tau-1 (axon marker, 1:1000, 
MAB3420, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 
(MAP2, dendrite marker, 1:1000, AB1543, Millipore), guinea pig polyclonal anti-vesicular glutamate 
transporter 1 (vGlut-1, pre-synapse marker, 1:1000, AB5905, Millipore), or mouse monoclonal anti-
PSD95 (post-synapse marker, 1:1000, ab2723, Abcam) primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The neurons 
were then reacted with anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor488 (A11001, Invitrogen) or anti-rabbit IgG-
AlexaFluor568 (A11011, Invitrogen) or anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor647 (A-21245, Invitrogen) or anti-
Guinea Pig IgG-AlexaFluor488 (A-11073, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature.

cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

Primary hippocampal neurons on microplates were genetically manipulated by adeno-associated
virus vectors to express green fluorescent protein (GFP, AV-9-PV1917, Penn Vector Core) or GCaMP6
(intracellular Ca2+ indicator, AV-1-PV2822, Penn Vector Core) under the control of a neuron-specific

the microplates were observed after 1 day.
2.5. Immunostaining of Neurons on Microplates
Neurons were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako) for 1 h, permeabilized with 0.5% TritonX100
(Alfa Aesar, Lancashire, UK) for 6 min, and incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma)
for 1 h.
The fixed cells were treated with mouse monoclonal anti-Tau-1 (axon marker, 1:1000,
MAB3420, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-microtubule-associated protein 2
(MAP2, dendrite marker, 1:1000, AB1543, Millipore), guinea pig polyclonal anti-vesicular glutamate
transporter 1 (vGlut-1, pre-synapse marker, 1:1000, AB5905, Millipore), or mouse monoclonal
anti-PSD95 (post-synapse marker, 1:1000, ab2723, Abcam) primary antibody at 4 ◦C overnight.
The neurons were then reacted with anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor488 (A11001, Invitrogen) or anti-rabbit
IgG-AlexaFluor568 (A11011, Invitrogen) or anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor647 (A-21245, Invitrogen)
or anti-Guinea Pig IgG-AlexaFluor488 (A-11073, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature.

2.6. SEM Imaging
We sputtered platinum (Pt) on the microplates before scanning electron microscope (SEM,
SU-8000 FESEM, Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Tokyo, Japan) observation.
Neurons on the
microplates were freeze-dried before SEM observation. We fixed the neurons by replacing the culture
medium with 2% glutaraldehyde (Wako) solution and waited for 15 min. The microplates were then
washed with pure water three times, and washed with 30%, 50%, 70% ethanol for one time each.
After 10 min, the microplates were immersed in 80%, 90%, 95%, 99.5% ethanol for 10 min each and
washed with 99.5% ethanol two times. We immersed the microplates in a tert-butyl alcohol solution
(Wako) for 10 min and repeated this a total of three times. The culture dish with microplates was
covered by parafilm, and frozen in a −80 ◦C freezer for 5 min. Finally, the microplates were dried in a
freeze-drier (FS-2030, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), sputtered with Pt, and observed by SEM.
2.7. Image Acquisition and Processing
Inverted microscopes (IX71 or IX81, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were used to take phase contrast
and fluorescent images. In Ca2+ imaging, culture medium was replaced with basal salt solution
(described in Section 2.2) to induce spontaneous neuronal activity, then imaged by real-time confocal
microscopy (LSM710, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Time-lapse movies were taken with inverted
microscopes (Olympus IX81) equipped with a humidified 37 ◦C incubator chamber containing 5% CO2.
The images were processed using ImageJ (NIH) to enhance their contrast for visualization. The stained
cells were pseudo-colored by ImageJ for visibility.
2.8. Handling of Single Neurons on Microplates
The tip of a glass capillary was heated and pulled to attain a diameter of 1 µm, then coated with
1 µm parylene. The parylene-coated glass capillary was attached to a micro-manipulator. We handled
single neurons on microplates by pushing the side of a microplate with the parylene-coated glass
capillary. The manipulation procedures were conducted in less than 15 min to avoid large pH and
temperature changes.
3. Results
3.1. Controllability of Position of Cell Body/Axon/Dendrites on Microplates
To investigate whether single primary hippocampal neurons were patterned on microplates,
we seeded neurons and observed the results by SEM and fluorescent microscopy (Figure 3). At 6 days
after seeding onto microplates, neurons were observed by SEM (Figure 3a). The cell bodies were
positioned on the cell body parts, and neuronal processes (axons or dendrites) grew only on the Axon
and Dendrite parts. We observed stained neurons on the microplates by MAP2 immunostaining
(Figure 2b), and found that the neuronal processes could be patterned even when the number of
Dendrite parts was three. We previously found that the success rate of patterning neuronal processes
of PC12 neuron-like cells decreased as the number of lines increased [22], thus we used microplates
with one Dendrite part for the rest of the experiments to make the success rate as high as possible.
To check whether the cell on a microplate was a neuron or another type of brain cell, such as a glial
cell, we specifically marked neurons on the microplates by expressing GFP under a neuron-specific
promoter by transfection with an adeno-associated virus (Figure 3c). The cells on the microplates
showed green fluorescence, confirming that they were indeed neurons.
To quantify the success rate of single neuron patterning on the microplates, we counted the
number of cells on the microplates at day 7 after cell seeding (Figure 3d). The success rate of single cell
positioning was approximately 10%, and multiple cells tended to attach on the microplates. The low
success rate might be improved in a future study by employing precise cell positioning techniques such
as microfluidic devices. We checked the position of cell body on the successful samples (Figure 3e),
and found approximately half of the cell bodies were attached on the cell body part, but the rest were

attached to the Axon or Dendrite parts. In our previous study, PC12 neuron-like cells migrated from
the line part to circle part, however, we observed that the cultured neurons did not migrate very
frequently. The low rate of accurate positioning of the cell body might also be improved by precise cell
positioning techniques in the future.

like cells migrated from the line part to circle part, however, we observed that the cultured neurons 
did not migrate very frequently. The low rate of accurate positioning of the cell body might also be 
improved by precise cell positioning techniques in the future.

To investigate whether the Axon and Dendrite part of the microplates enable patterning of the 
axon and dendrites of single neurons, we immunostained for Tau-1 (axon marker) and MAP2 
(dendrite marker) and observed the results by fluorescent microscopy (Figure 4). At day 4 after cell 
seeding, we found a neuron on a microplate whose axon was on the Axon part and dendrite on the 
Dendrite part (Figure 4a, Tau-1: magenta, and MAP2: green, pseudo-colored). We measured intensity 
of the Tau-1 and MAP2 marker fluorescence, and found that the Tau-1 signal (axon) were higher on the 
Axon part (Figure 4b), and the MAP2 signal (dendrite) were higher on the Dendrite part (Figure 4c). 
Therefore, we can say that the shape of the microplate enabled control of axon-dendrite morphology.

3.2. Assembly and Connection of Neurons on the Microplates
To confirm that the position of the neuron-laden microplates can be changed, we manipulated
the microplates by a glass capillary tube controlled by a micro-manipulator (Figure 5a). After 4 days
of culture, the microplate could be manipulated by pushing the side with the tip of a glass capillary
tube. Two morphologically controlled single neurons on microplates could both be micromanipulated,
and adjoined during culture (Figure 5b, Video S1). To show that the assembled neurons could form
functional synaptic connections, we immunostained the assembled neurons for synapse markers
(vGlut1: pre-synaptic, PSD95: post-synaptic) and MAP2 (Figure 5c). We observed that pre-synaptic
marker vGlut1 and post-synaptic marker PSD95 co-localized at a spot on a dendrite stained by MAP2.
We measured the fluorescence intensity of the spot and plotted the normalized intensity (Figure 5c,
right graph). The graph shows that the signals of vGlut1 and PSD95 overlap with the MAP2 signal,
which suggests that a synaptic connection was formed by the adjoined neurons.

We measured the fluorescence intensity of the spot and plotted the normalized intensity (Figure 5c, 
right graph). The graph shows that the signals of vGlut1 and PSD95 overlap with the MAP2 signal, 
which suggests that a synaptic connection was formed by the adjoined neurons.

Finally, we observed a synaptic connection of the adjoined neurons by measuring neuronal
activity (Figure 5d, Figure S1, Video S2). The neurons were transfected by adeno-virus to express
GCaMP6, which emits green fluorescent signals depending on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
An example is shown in the left and center panel of Figure 5d. Two single neurons on microplates were
preliminarily assembled by micro-manipulation, and expressed GCaMP6. We traced the time course of
fluorescence change of the GCaMP6, and found that the signals of the two neurons synchronized at a
moment (Figure 5d, right panel, Figure S1). The graph in Figure 5d shows the changes in fluorescence
signals of the cell bodies of the two cells in the left panel (F: initial fluorescent intensity, ∆F: change
in fluorescent intensity between neighboring frames of the time lapse movie). We observed that
the fluorescence signals of the two neurons—representing neuronal activity—were synchronized.
As shown in Figure S1, activities of the two neurons synchronized at a certain moment, while those of
other neurons on neighbor microplates did not synchronized. This result indicates that the overlap of
traces of the two cells was not coincidental but synapse-related synchronization (a synaptic connection
was formed between the two neurons).
4. Discussion
The newly designed microplate enabled culturing of single primary hippocampal neurons and
control of their axon-dendrite morphology. The morphologically controlled single neurons could
be micromanipulated and assembled during culture. We observed synaptic connections between
adjoined neurons by immunostaining for co-localized synapse-related proteins, and by measurement
of synchronization of neuronal activity with intracellular Ca2+ imaging. For the first time, the mobile
microplate method enabled changing the position of morphologically controlled single primary
neurons, since in a conventional setup they die when they are detached from the culture. The method
may be useful in designing neuronal networks with single cell-resolution, which is difficult to achieve
by conventional micropatterning techniques.
The success rate of single neuron positioning was as low as in previous studies (less than 10%).
There were three possible reasons of the low rate. First, neurons that were randomly seeded on a
microplate aggregated, and single cells were rarely found. To overcome the multiple cell aggregation,
it will be necessary in the future to precisely position single neurons on each microplate by microfluidic
techniques such as droplet-based single cell isolation and positioning [25]. Second, neuronal cell
bodies and neuronal processes tended to localize to undesired parts of the microplate. As shown in
Figure 5c,d, cell body sometimes migrated toward the Axon and Dendrite parts. This problem was
probably a result of the size and structure of the Cell body, Axon, and Dendrite parts of the microplates.
It will be necessary to optimize the size of the microplates (e.g., fabricating a narrower Axon and
Dendrite parts to prevent intrusion of soma from Cell body part, since soma tends to adhere on wide
area) and add structures such as walls on the microplates to avoid having cell bodies migrated to
the Axon and Dendrite parts. Finally, single neurons tended to die when they were cultured alone.
Co-culturing with glia and connection with other neurons may be important factors for neuronal
survival [26], thus preparation and assembly of glia-laden microplates and detailed investigation of
the relationship between neuronal cell death and time before assembly are needed.
Although we observed clear examples of functional synaptic connection between assembled
neurons by immunostaining and Ca2+ imaging, it was difficult to observe assembled neurons
with well-controlled morphology, and this hampered quantification of synaptic connections.
Regarding immunostaining, it was necessary to refresh the medium around neurons many times
during fixing and antibody treatment, which frequently disassembled the assembled microplates,
since they could easily be moved by the drag force of the medium. For more precise analysis, it will be
necessary to add microfabricated structures to stabilize the assembled microplates. In Ca2+ imaging,
although it did not require medium exchange, imaging of well-controlled neurons was difficult.
Since the assembled microplates were often disassembled when we merely transported the whole
culture dish to another place, the microplate device was essentially not able to be moved, and only one
 Micromachines 2018, 9, 235

point was observable. Combined with the low success rate of morphological control of single neurons
on the microplates, this made it very difficult to repeat assembly and Ca2+ imaging. To improve
the results, the success rate of morphological control of single neurons on a microplate needs to
be increased and a microfabricated structure for stabilizing the assembled microplates is needed,
as mentioned above.
Synchronization of assembled neurons observed in Figure 5 was considered to be synapse-oriented
by the long traces shown in Figure S1. Neuronal activities of the two neurons did not synchronize at
1.7 s, and synchronized at 34.8 s, indicating that the input signal of pre-synaptic cell 2 was not sufficient
to fire post-synaptic cell 1, or action potential of the post-synaptic cell 2 did not affect pre-synaptic
cell 1. We could not clearly distinguish pre or post synaptic neurons from the results, however,
as already described in Section 3.2, the overlap of activities was not coincidental but synapse-related
synchronization since activities of the other neurons on neighbor microplates did not synchronized at
the same time.
5. Conclusions
We developed mobile microplates that enable axon-dendrite morphology control and assembly of
single primary neurons. A synaptic connection between assembled neurons was indicated. We believe
the method will be useful in engineering neuronal networks at the single-cell-level resolution to
develop artificially designed brain on a chip.
