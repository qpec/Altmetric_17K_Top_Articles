Abstract
Tick-borne pathogens are increasing their range and incidence in North America as a conse-
quence of numerous factors including improvements in diagnostics and diagnosis, range
expansion of primary vectors, changes in human behavior, and an increasing understanding
of the diversity of species of pathogens that cause human disease. Public health agencies
have access to human incidence data on notifiable diseases e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi, the
causative agent of Lyme disease, and often local pathogen prevalence in vector popula-
tions. However, data on exposure to vectors and pathogens can be difficult to determine
e.g., if disease does not occur.
We report on an investigation of exposure to ticks and tick-borne bacteria, conducted at a
national scale, using citizen science participation. 16,080 ticks were submitted between Jan-
uary 2016 and August 2017, and screened for B. burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma pha-
gocytophilum, and Babesia microti. These data corroborate entomologic investigations of
tick distributions in North America, but also identify patterns of local disease risk and tick
contact with humans throughout the year in numerous species of ticks and associated
pathogens.
Introduction
Tick-borne pathogens have emerged or have expanded their geographic range throughout
North America and are currently the most frequently reported vector-borne disease threat in
the US [1–3]. For example, Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and
transmitted by Ixodes scapularis in the eastern US and I. pacificus in the western US, is the
most abundant vector-borne disease in North America with an estimated incidence of
>300,000 cases per year [1]. Additional pathogens transmitted to humans by these same tick
species include the sister spirochetes Borrelia miyamotoi and B. mayonii which are newly
recognized as human pathogens [4–7], as well as the causative agents of granulocytic

 anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), human monocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaf-
feensis) and human babesiosis (Babesia microti) [3]. Other medically important hard-tick spe-
cies include Amblyomma spp. and Dermacentor spp. that can transmit other Ehrlichia spp. and
Francisella tularensis [8–11].
The incidence of tick-borne disease is the culmination of human exposure to an infected
tick and consequent transmission of the pathogen. Data on the incidence of human disease rely
on reports submitted to local, state and national health departments by laboratories, physicians
and/or health care providers following diagnosis of illness in patients or identification of the
pathogen in specimen samples [1]. Data on the risk of tick-borne diseases often depend on
field-based observations of tick abundance and/or pathogen prevalence [12–13], but are often
only relevant to a relatively small geographic area [14]. Unfortunately, descriptions of disease
incidence and local risk do not actually describe patterns of exposure to tick bite i.e., where
and when people come into contact with ticks. This type of data could be useful to reconcile
information on local tick risk and incidence [15]. However, it is no trivial matter to understand
rates of human contact, as researchers typically are limited by logistical and cost constraints to
small-scale studies of tick-biting behavior [16].
Citizen science–when members of the public collaborate with scientists to collect data and
samples–has recently been demonstrated as an effective technique to accomplish data collec-
tion and disease ecology surveillance at a scale unattainable by a limited research group of sci-
entists alone [17–18]. For example, citizen science has been used to monitor the Asian tiger
mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in Spain [19], and the spread of sudden oak death (caused by Phy-
tophthora ramorum) in California [20]. Indeed, citizen science can offer information on
national patterns in health issues and simultaneously convert the public from passive recipi-
ents of information to active participants in scientific study and, in effect, increase the body of
scientific knowledge on an issue that is directly affecting them [17]. Citizen science approaches
have previously been adopted to look at the ecology and epidemiology of tick-borne diseases
in Canada, Finland and Massachusetts, US [18, 21–24]. Here, we report our first results on citi-
zen scientist-collected data from across the US, to help broaden our geographic investigation
and surveillance of ticks and tick-borne pathogens.
Materials and methods
Passive tick surveillance
From January 2016 until August 2017, Northern Arizona University offered a free tick identifi-
cation and testing service made available to the general public i.e., citizen scientists, advertised
through an initial public relation campaign and then made available to the public via a web
site (Bay Area Lyme Foundation, http://www.bayarealyme.org/lyme-disease-prevention/tick-
testing/). Broad geographic coverage was not systematically attempted however many Lyme
Disease advocacy groups shared the website link on their own websites. Each submission
included a description of an approximate location where the tick was encountered, habitat
type, host type (human, pet, etc.), date encountered, and activity of the individual who encoun-
tered the tick. An email for a response was also included; however, no personal-identifying
information was collected (e.g., name, address, gender). Importantly, submissions did not
include information of recent travel history, and we accepted location information from the
data submitted by the citizen scientist submitter without verification.
Ticks were sent to Northern Arizona University via mail and enclosed in zip-locked plastic
bags. Upon arrival, ticks were identified to species, sex and stage using morphological charac-
teristics [25–26]. For some species (e.g., Dermacentor spp.), using morphological traits to dif-
ferentiate species can be difficult [27], but because the species are normally allopatric [28], we

 incorporated information on geographic range to allow species identification [29–30]. We did
not evaluate engorgement status of the tick during identification. Individual ticks were then
placed into 70% ethanol prior to nucleotide extraction.
Pathogen detection
The program tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocy-
tophilum, and Babesia microti via qPCR. Total DNA was extracted using the DNeasy blood
and tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following manufacturers recommendations with a
few modifications. Ticks were bisected prior to placement in the Buffer ATL and Protease K,
then incubated overnight at 56˚C. In addition, during the elution step, 75 μl of sterile DI water
was used as the elution buffer, columns were incubated at 56˚C for 5 minutes prior to centrifu-
gation, and the flow-through solution was then re-eluted for optimal DNA capture. The DNA
solution was then placed into a freezer (-20˚ C) until further analysis.
All extractions were subjected to qPCR using previously developed primers and hybridiza-
tion probes specific to each of the pathogens tested (Table 1). All assays were performed using
SsoAdvanced Universal Probes Supermix 1X (Life Science Research, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
on a CFX96-TOUCH system (Life Science Research, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and followed a
two-step cycling protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Each 20 μl reaction contained
primers at a concentration of 300 nM and probe at 250 nM (Applied Biosystems, Life Technol-
ogies, Carlsbad, CA) and included negative controls on every run. Samples were considered
positive if they had a cycle threshold (CT) value < 40 and logarithmic amplification plots.
Spatial and statistical analysis
County level-nationwide maps were created for each tick and pathogen species using ArcGIS
10.5 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). For each tick species, pathogen, and in each state we calculated the
qPCR-prevalence and 95% confidence intervals by the proportions test (prop.test) in the statis-
tical package “R” (R-Development Core Team, http://www.r-project.org).
Results
Tick submissions
We received a total of 12,130 submissions from across the US’ 50 states and Puerto Rico, with
an average of 1.33 (range = 1–84 ticks) ticks/submission, resulting in a total of 16,080 ticks col-
lected and tested for pathogens (Fig 1A). Although 1.4% (223/16,080) of ticks were not mor-
phologically identifiable due to decomposition or the removal of key morphological traits,
these samples were still qPCR tested for pathogen presence. A total of 1.6% (265/12,130) of
submissions were not ticks; these samples included insects (e.g. bees, beetles and ants), arach-
nids (e.g. mites), and scabs. None of the submissions from Alaska included ticks.

 Ticks arrived in two annual pulses: one in the spring and a second smaller peak in the fall
(Fig 1B). For example, in a single week in May 2017, we received ~600 submissions and ~1,000
ticks from across the US. The second year of surveillance, 2017, had a marked increase in sub-
missions compared to 2016 e.g., 9,391 ticks collected in 7 months in 2017, compared to 6,532
ticks in 12 months in 2016.
Ticks were predominantly removed from human hosts (71.4%, 11,486/16,080) and dogs
(17.1%, 2,746/16,080). Other host species included other domesticated animals (e.g. cats, rab-
bits), wildlife (e.g. deer, raccoons, rabbits) and livestock (e.g., goats, horses, pigs).
Submitted ticks were most often reported to have bitten their hosts (73.9%, 11,890/16,080),
with the minority being reported as questing/crawling (23.4%, 3,766/16,080). Adult ticks com-
prised the highest number of submissions (80.0%, 12,867/16,080), followed by nymphs (17.7%,
2,846/16,080), larvae (0.9%, 144/16,080) and 223 (1.3%) unknowns (Table 2). Adult female

 ticks (68.2% 8,777/12,867 were submitted more frequently than male ticks (31.6%, 4062/
12,867) and a small percentage (0.2%, 28/12,867) were not identifiable to sex.
Geographic distribution of submitted tick specimens
We identified a total of 13 species of ticks from 49 states (all except Alaska) and Puerto Rico
(Table 2, Fig 1A). The county-level distribution of each tick species generated by the citizen
science submissions generally reflected the known distribution of each species, though there
were some anomalies.
Both Ixodes species, I. scapularis (black-legged tick) and I. pacificus (western black-legged
tick), were identified within their known distribution [12] though some new counties were
identified as potential sources of these tick species. These ‘new’ county locations were most
often adjacent or in close proximity to counties with an established presence of Ixodes ticks
(Fig 2).
The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, was identified throughout the eastern US,
especially in the southeast, though also occasionally from individuals in far northern Wiscon-
sin and Michigan, Maine and upstate New York. These incidents echo previous reported

 observations of the lone star tick [34]. We also received six A. americanum ticks from Califor-
nia (3 nymphs and 3 adults) (see Discussion). The Gulf Coast tick, A. maculatum, and the Cay-
enne tick, A. cajennense, were identified in southeastern US states, but in lower numbers than
A. americanum (Fig 3A).
The American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, the Rocky Mountain wood tick, D. ander-
soni, and the Pacific Coast tick, D. occidentalis were submitted from counties corresponding to
their current known distribution [25, 29–30, 35] (Fig 3B and 3C). One D. variabilis was also
submitted from Puerto Rico.
We received brown dog ticks, Rhipicephalus sanguineous from a number of states in the
southern US, western US, and from Hawaii (Fig 3D). Our pathogen screening did not detect
infections in any of the R. sanguineus ticks submitted for testing (N = 119).
A few rare tick species were also submitted, including a single I. spinipalpis (from Califor-
nia), one Haemaphysalis leporispalustris (from Colorado), one Otobius megini (from Califor-
nia), and one Ornithodoros hermsi (from New Mexico), the rarity of which was expected given
the high specificity of their life-history and tendency to feed on wildlife or domestic animal
hosts [25] (Table 3). No pathogens were detected in any of these rare species.
Tick-borne pathogen prevalence
A total of 16,080 ticks were tested individually for four tick-borne pathogens via qPCR
(Table 4). All four pathogens were detected in I. scapularis, D. variabilis, and A. americanum
submissions, the three species with the highest numbers of submissions (Table 2). While inter-
esting, qPCR-positivity in the non-primary vector species may be more representative of expo-
sure to pathogens, rather than the ability of the tick to competently transmit the pathogen.

 Borrelia burgdorferi.
B. burgdorferi qPCR-positive samples were predominantly detected
in recognized primary tick vectors. In I. scapularis, the prevalence was 19.5% in adult ticks
(585/2997, CI = 18.1–21.0), and 11.0% in nymphs (173/1560, CI = 9.6–12.8), and 5.1% in lar-
vae (5/98, CI = 1.9–12.1) (overall prevalence of 16.4%, 765/4671, CI = 15.3–17.5). I. scapularis
submitted from northeastern US states had the highest prevalence of B. burgdorferi, ranging
from 6.5–23.1% (Table 2).
In contrast, in the western US, B. burgdorferi infections were highest in I. pacificus larvae
with a prevalence of 5.9% (1/17, CI = 0.3–30.8), followed by 3.5% (62/1785, CI = 2.7–4.5) in
adults and 1.8% (4/225, CI = 0.6–4.8) in nymphs (overall prevalence of 3.3%, 67/2027,
CI = 2.6–4.2).
B. burgdorferi DNA was also identified in A. americanum, with the highest prevalence of
4.8% (1/21, CI = 0.2–25.9) in larval ticks, followed by 1.4% (24/1754, CI = 0.9–2.0) in adults
and 0.7% (2/299, CI = 0.9–2.0) in nymphs (overall prevalence of 1.2% (27 / 2078, CI = 0.9–
1.9). Amblyomma spp., nymphs and larvae (2.1%, 14/661, CI = 1.2–3.6) and an A. maculatum
adult (5.2%, 1/21, CI = 0.3–28.1) tested positive for B. burgdorferi, as did D. occidentalis (0.8%,
2/264, CI = 0.1–3) and D. variabilis (0.9%, 54/5853, CI = 0.7–1.2).
Borrelia miyamotoi.
The newly identified human pathogen, B. miyamotoi, exhibited a
higher prevalence of infection in western black-legged ticks compared to the eastern congener.
In the western US, prevalence was highest in larval I. pacificus ticks (5.9%, 1/17, CI = 0.3–30.8),
followed by adults (1.8%, 33/1785, CI = 1.3–2.6), and nymphs (0.9%, 2/225, CI = 0.2–3.5), and
an overall prevalence of 1.8% (N = 36/2027, 1.8%, CI = 1.3–2.5).
B. miyamotoi DNA was also identified in I. scapularis populations (1.3%, 60/467, CI = 1.0–
1.7), with the highest prevalence in larvae (2.0%, 2/98, CI = 0.4–7.9), followed by adult ticks
(1.4%, 41/2,997, CI = 1.0–1.9), and nymphs (1.1%, 17/1,560, CI = 0.7–1.8). Other tick species,
not currently recognized as competent vectors, were also observed with B. miyamotoi infec-
tions: A. americanum (1.3%, 28/2078, CI = 0.9–2), an A. maculatum adult (4.8%, 1/21,

CI = 0.3–0.6).
Anaplasma phagocytophilum.
I. scapularis samples contained the highest prevalence of
A. phagocytophilum infections (4.1%, 191/4671, CI = 3.5–4.7) with adult ticks accounting for
the highest prevalence (5.1%, 153/2,997, CI = 4.4–6.0), followed by nymphs (2.4%, 38/1560,
CI = 1.8–3.4). I. pacificus also harbored A. phagocytophilum (1.1%, 23/2,033, CI = 0.7–1.7);
prevalence was 1.2% in adult ticks (21/1,785, CI = 0.7–1.8) and 0.9% in nymphs (2/225,
CI = 0.2–3.5). A. phagocytophilum DNA was also found in A. americanum adults (0.3%, 6/
2078, CI = 0.1–0.7%), an A. maculatum adult (4.8%, 1/21, CI = 0.2–25.9), Amblyomma spp.
(nymphs) (0.5%, 3/661 CI = 0.1–1.4). D. variabilis (0.5%, 28/5853, CI = 0.3–0.7%), D. andersoni
(0.8%, 1/132 CI = 0–4.8), and D. occidentalis (0.4%, 1/264, 0–2.4) also had a low prevalence of
A. phagocytophilum.
Babesia microti.
Amblyomma americanum ticks contained the highest prevalence of Bab.
microti (2.5%, 51/2078, CI = 2.5–3.2), with adults accounting for the highest prevalence of
2.6% (46/1754, CI = 1.9–3.5), followed by nymphs at 1.7% (5/299, CI = 0.6–4.0), and
Amblyomma spp. nymphs (1.4%, 9/656, CI = 0.7–2.7). Bab. microti was also detected in I. sca-
pularis (1.8%, 86/4671, CI = 1.5–2.3), with adults having a prevalence of 2.1% (64/2997,
CI = 1.7–2.7) followed by 1.3% in nymphs (20/1,560, CI = 0.8–2.0). A low prevalence of Bab.
microti was observed in D. variabilis (0.2%, 10/5,850, CI = 0.1–0.3).
Co-infections in ticks.
Co-infections were identified in 0.98% (N = 158, CI = 0.8–1.2) of
tested ticks, and I. scapularis accounted for 88.0% (139/158) of these co-infections. The most
common co-infection was between A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi, with an overall prev-
alence of 0.5% (83 / 16080, CI = 0.4–0.6%) and specifically in I. scapularis, 1.7% (79/4671,
CI = 1.3–2.1). Co-infections with Bab. microti and B. burgdorferi also occurred with an overall
prevalence of 0.2% (N = 36, CI = 0.2–0.3) and in I. scapularis, 0.7% (34/4,671, CI = 0.5–1.0). Co-
infections were predominantly found in adult ticks (81.6%, 129/158, CI = 74.5–87.2). In addi-
tion, seven I. scapularis ticks were infected with triple infections of B. burgdorferi-A. phagocyto-
philum-Bab. microti (0.1%, 7/4671, CI = 0.07–0.3). No ticks were positive for all four pathogens.
Discussion
Citizen science surveillance
Our citizen science based collection method resulted in a relatively low cost and widespread
collection of ticks from across the US, and provides insights into the patterns of tick exposure
on humans, pets and in a few cases, wildlife. It is worth noting that this kind of science obvi-
ously taps into a desire for knowledge into disease ecology and epidemiology among the gen-
eral populace. When the project was initiated, we expected approximately 2,400 submissions;
and at times were almost overwhelmed by the actual 16,000-plus! Perhaps this response can be
credited to the nature of the investigation i.e., examining human-wildlife interactions at the
nexus of disease ecology and epidemiology is of an applied nature that is reflective of increas-
ing concerns about disease emergence in society. Or perhaps the public interest was because
the project facilitated tick-pathogen testing for free. Nonetheless, although the project did not
make use of any concerted advertising campaign beyond the website and word-of-mouth (the
program was easily accessible to all individuals seeking out tick testing via internet search
engines, and was generally one of the first results to an internet search of “tick testing”), the
submission of over 16,000 ticks demonstrates the potential to use citizen science as a surveil-
lance tool for public health and vector-borne diseases.
We believe that utilizing the citizen science potential in a local area could be broadly effec-
tive at providing public health managers with a relatively cheap (reduced labor and travel

 costs) and effective (greater scope) way of determining the risk of particular tick species in a
region. As mentioned earlier, this type of program has been used in other parts of the world
and has helped to clarify the types of ticks and pathogens people come into contact with specif-
ically. Additional information including travel history, knowledge of ticks and tick-borne dis-
ease in the area, and more specific demographic information about the citizen scientists would
help us understand the biases involved in data collection.
Citizen science based sampling does have its limitations, including uneven awareness of the
program and variation in the motivation of people who have ticks crawling or attached to
them to actually submit the ticks as samples. These issues permeate passive surveillance pro-
grams generally. Concurrently, these data also have advantages in that they provide insights
into geographical patterns or exposure to ticks and tick-borne pathogens that are not limited
by jurisdictional boundaries, or by financial constraints and/or access to healthcare as the total
cost for participants was simply the price required for mailing samples.
Geographic distribution of tick species
Our data on geographic distributions of tick exposures corroborate and expand previously
published records on tick distribution ranges. For example, we received I. scapularis from 594
counties and 35 US states and I. pacificus in 79 counties from 6 states. These data echo findings
from an extensive literature search examining the reported presence of ticks within US coun-
ties: I. scapularis in 1,420 counties in 37 states, and I. pacificus in 111 counties and six states
[12]. It therefore seems feasible that citizen science contributions can augment our scientific
knowledge of where and when ticks are biting humans and animals, and perhaps can address
our current inability to properly define current tick and pathogen geographic distributions, as
well as to monitor changes in the ranges over time [12].
We did not collect travel history data of the people submitting ticks. Because ticks may
remain attached, even on clothing, for several days our geographic distribution data for both
tick and pathogen exposure must be regarded with caution [36–37]. However, ‘new’ county
records are often not far from recognized tick or pathogen distributions and suggest either
that prior efforts have not been adequate to report or collect ticks, the tick range is increasing,
and/or that human and pet movement should be considered by physicians and/or health agen-
cies when considering differential diagnoses for tick-borne diseases. A lack of data on travel
history may also explain the small number of outliers were detected during the program e.g.,
the submission of lone star ticks (A. americanum) from northern California, and a single
black-legged tick (I. scapularis) from northern Montana which are both locations well outside
of the recorded range for these species. These anomalies could also reflect human error in
identification, the potential import of the tick from either migratory wildlife or livestock to the
area, or the fact that travel history was not included in the data [25, 38–39].
Geographic distribution of tick-borne pathogens
For the most part, surveillance for pathogens also mirrored conventional perspectives on tick-
borne diseases but our citizen-science based database also allows insights that are not available
from the typical chains of information that rely on notifiable disease status by state. For exam-
ple, babesiosis has been reported in 15/18 states where the disease is reportable, and predomi-
nantly in just seven states (97% of cases in just Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) [40]. We observed Bab. microti in several
states where this pathogen is not a reportable disease (Table 3), and so although our data do
not necessarily reflect an increase in geographical distribution, they do provide additional
insight on the ecology and epidemiology of the disease. This kind of data could be used to

 inform predictive models of tick-borne disease spread that are currently restricted by the avail-
ability of human disease data [41]. Once again, this interpretation is subject to the caveat that
we do not have travel data associated with the submitted ticks. In addition, the tick submis-
sions confirm that babesiosis is a rare disease in the west coast; however the diversity of Babesia
organisms in the west is likely unrealized (e.g., Washington, Oregon and California). For
example, infection by Bab. duncani has occurred via transfusions in California, and Bab. conra-
dae has been detected in dogs, however there is still no know vector or reservoir host for the
piroplasms [42–43].
Nonetheless, citizen science-sourced data are not perfect. For example, our data did not
observe A. phagocytophilum in Oklahoma, Arkansas or Missouri, where human cases have
been identified [44]. Similarly, field surveillance efforts for ticks in California have demon-
strated the presence of B. miyamotoi or A. phagocytophilum in counties that were not identified
as locations for these pathogens based on citizen-science submitted ticks [45–46]. Obviously,
when a pathogen is rare there will be more variation in the ability to detect the pathogen,
which may be the case in the far western US. Additionally, our data identified a number of B.
burgdorferi positive larvae which contradicts evidence the spirochete has limited, if any transo-
varial transmission. This however can be explained by the fact that the larvae tested come from
poorly characterized sources and did not include engorgement status or infection status of the
host. The result may be that the prevalence then that we estimate may be inflated.
Lyme disease transmission is associated with I. pacificus and I. scapularis, but we observed
B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi in lone star, Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast and American dog ticks.
However, these observations are presumably because these tick species feed on the reservoir
hosts for these pathogens; these data do not on their own provide evidence that the tick species
are involved in disease transmission. Indeed, xenodiagnostic experiments have failed to dem-
onstrate viable pathogen transmission of B. burgdorferi by lone star or American dog ticks
[47–49]. Previous studies have observed Babesia in lone star ticks, and suggested the potential
for vector competence, but experimental studies are required to confirm pathogen transmis-
sion cycles in particular tick studies [49].
Conclusions
In conclusion, citizen science data on tick ecology, combined with pathogen screening, offers
insights into geographic patterns and distributions of these organisms at a scale that is difficult
to compete with by laboratories or government agencies. These data can also be used at a more
local scale to examine the phenology of human-tick encounters, geographical diversity of tick
and pathogen genetics and so on.
