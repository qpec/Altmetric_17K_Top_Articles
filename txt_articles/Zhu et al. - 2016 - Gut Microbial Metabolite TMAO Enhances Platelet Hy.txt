SUMMARY
Normal platelet function is critical to blood hemosta-
sis and maintenance of a closed circulatory system.
Heightened platelet reactivity, however, is associ-
ated with cardiometabolic diseases and enhanced
potential for thrombotic events. We now show gut
microbes, through generation of trimethylamine
N-oxide (TMAO), directly contribute to platelet hy-
perreactivity and enhanced thrombosis potential.
Plasma TMAO levels in subjects (n > 4,000) indepen-
dently predicted incident (3 years) thrombosis (heart
attack, stroke) risk. Direct exposure of platelets to
TMAO enhanced sub-maximal stimulus-dependent
platelet activation from multiple agonists through
augmented Ca2+ release from intracellular stores.
Animal model studies employing dietary choline or
TMAO, germ-free mice, and microbial transplanta-
tion collectively confirm a role for gut microbiota
and TMAO in modulating platelet hyperresponsive-
ness and thrombosis potential and identify microbial
taxa associated with plasma TMAO and thrombosis
potential. Collectively, the present results reveal a
previously unrecognized mechanistic link between
specific dietary nutrients, gut microbes, platelet
function, and thrombosis risk.
INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular arterial thrombotic events, such as myocardial
infarction and stroke, are a leading cause of disability and mor-
tality. Platelet activation, aggregation, and the subsequent gen-
eration of an occlusive intra-arterial thrombus are essential steps
in atherothrombotic disease, and enhanced platelet reactivity is
associated with both the extent of end organ injury and adverse
prognosis (Frossard et al., 2004; Tantry et al., 2013). Platelet hy-
perreactivity and thrombosis risk are enhanced in the setting of
numerous conditions associated with atherosclerotic heart dis-
ease, such as hyperlipidemia, oxidant stress, and hyperglycemia
(Podrez et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2012). Under-
standing the mechanisms through which platelets become hy-
perresponsive and more prone to clot formation is therefore of
considerable importance (Jennings, 2009).
The past decade has witnessed a rapidly growing awareness of
the involvement of gut microbial organisms in the development of
numerous cardiometabolic phenotypes (Ba
¨ ckhed et al., 2004;
Turnbaugh et al., 2006; Cox et al., 2014). For example, recent
studies reveal participation of gut microbes in a metaorganismal
pathway that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis
(Wang et al., 2011; Koeth et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2013; Gregory
et al., 2015). Briefly, specific trimethylamine (TMA)-containing di-
etary nutrients, such as phosphatidylcholine, choline, and carni-
tine, can be used by gut microbes as a carbon fuel source.
A waste product produced is TMA, which is carried via the portal
circulation to the liver, where it is rapidly converted by a family of
enzymes, host hepatic flavin monooxygenases (FMOs), into TMA
N-oxide (TMAO) (Wang et al., 2011). Animal model studies show
direct provision of TMAO within the diet is pro-atherogenic, and
similarly, provision of its dietary precursors (e.g., choline, carni-
tine, gamma butyrobetaine) also accelerates atherosclerosis
development, but only in the setting of intact gut microbiota and
TMA/TMAO generation (Wang et al., 2011; Koeth et al., 2013,
2014). Recent studies involving genetic manipulation of FMO3,
the major FMO responsible for converting TMA into TMAO (Ben-
nett et al., 2013), further confirm the involvement of this meta-
organismal pathway in both atherosclerosis development and
regulation of whole-body cholesterol and sterol metabolism
(Miao et al., 2015; Shih et al., 2015; Warrier et al., 2015). Moreover,
an obligatory role for gut microbes in TMAO generation in humans
was affirmed by two distinct studies involving ingestion of either
isotope-labeled phosphatidylcholine or isotope-labeled carnitine
as a tracer before versus following exposure to an oral cocktail
of poorly absorbed antibiotics to suppress intestinal microbes
(Tang et al., 2013; Koeth et al., 2013). Finally, an association be-
tween plasma TMAO levels and both the extent of coronary

 atherosclerotic plaque burden and CVD risks has been observed
in multiple distinct clinical studies (Wang et al., 2011; Tang et al.,
2013, 2014, 2015; Lever et al., 2014).
Insights into the mechanisms through which the meta-organ-
ismal pathway responsible for TMAO production are associated
with enhanced CVD risks have thus far focused on the involve-
ment of TMAO and FMO3 in atherosclerotic plaque develop-
ment, altered sterol and glucose metabolism, and changes in
macrophage phenotype (Wang et al., 2011; Koeth et al., 2013;
Miao et al., 2015; Shih et al., 2015; Warrier et al., 2015). The
involvement of gut microbes and TMAO in modulation of platelet
function and thrombosis risks in vivo has not yet been reported.
RESULTS
Plasma TMAO Levels Predict Incident Thrombotic
Event Risk
We previously reported an association between plasma levels
of TMAO and incident risk for the composite of major adverse
cardiovascular events in a cohort of sequential stable subjects
(n = 4,007) presenting to a cardiology clinic for elective
diagnostic cardiac evaluations and for whom adjudicated
longitudinal follow-up (3 year) for incident development of
myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, death, or need for revascu-
larization were collected (Tang et al., 2013). Initially, we there-
fore sought to reanalyze the clinical dataset and test whether
an association between plasma levels of TMAO and incident
risk for thrombotic events (MI or stroke) was observed.
Plasma TMAO levels within the cohort showed a large dy-
namic range (0.06 to 312 mM; Figure 1A). TMAO showed a
dose-dependent
association
with
increased
cumulative
burden of incident thrombotic events as illustrated by Ka-
plan-Meier survival analyses (Figure 1A). Importantly, the as-
sociation between TMAO and incident thrombosis risk was
observed even following adjustments for CVD history, tradi-
tional CVD risk factors, renal function, and medication use
(fourth quartile level versus first quartile, adjusted 1.64-fold
risk, p < 0.001; Figure 1A).

 TMAO Directly Enhances Human Platelet
Responsiveness to Multiple Agonists
The robust association observed between increasing TMAO
levels and incident risk of thrombotic events in subjects served
as impetus for further studies aimed at testing the hypothesis
that TMAO may directly modulate platelet function. Initially,
platelet-rich plasma was isolated from healthy volunteers
with low levels of TMAO (all in first quartile, < 2.4 mM), and
the effect of physiologically relevant levels of exogenous
TMAO (100 mM versus vehicle) on platelet activation by the
agonist ADP, as monitored by platelet aggregometry, was
examined. While inter-individual variations in the magnitude
of the effect of TMAO on platelet responsiveness to ADP stim-
ulation was seen (Figure S1), overall, a leftward shift (p <
0.0001) in the dose-response curve in the presence of high
TMAO levels was observed (Figure 1B, left). Upon further ex-
amination, the enhancing effect of TMAO on platelet function
was seen to be more generalizable, since similar results
were observed using washed human platelets briefly incu-
bated in the presence versus absence of TMAO (100 mM)
and varying doses of thrombin instead of ADP as agonist (Fig-
ure 1B, right).
Next, we examined the effect of TMAO on platelet adhesion to
collagen, a highly thrombogenic component of the sub-endothe-
lium (Furie and Furie, 2008). Platelets within whole blood were
fluorescently labeled, and adherence to the collagen surface of
a microfluidic device under physiological shear forces was moni-
tored in real time by microscopy, as described in the Experi-
mental Procedures. Figure 1C shows representative images of
the collagen-coated biochip under flow with whole blood from
a typical subject at initial (t = 0) and subsequent 1-min interval
periods of exposure and illustrates the visible increase in fluores-
cent platelet adhesion noted in the presence of TMAO. Com-
puter image-assisted quantification of adherent platelets was
employed, and cumulative data from multiple subjects (n = 11)
are shown in Figure 1D. TMAO significantly (p < 0.0001)
increased platelet adhesion within whole blood to immobilized
collagen under physiological shear force. In the absence of
collagen coating (± TMAO), platelet adhesion to the biochip sur-
face was negligible (Figure 1D). Cumulatively, the above data
demonstrate that physiological levels of TMAO directly enhance
platelet responsiveness to multiple distinct agonists (ADP,
thrombin, and collagen).
TMAO Enhances In Vivo Thrombosis
Since the enhancing effect of TMAO on platelet responsive-
ness is both rapid and direct, we reasoned that we should
be able to induce a relatively acute rise in plasma TMAO levels
within the physiologically observed range and simultaneously
enhance in vivo thrombosis potential. To test this, plasma
TMAO levels in mice were raised using intraperitoneal (i.p.)
TMAO injection (versus normal saline), and we quantified
in vivo thrombosis potential using a carotid artery injury
(FeCl3) model using fluorescently tagged platelets and intra-
vital microscopy (we aimed to perform the thrombosis model
when plasma TMAO was �100 mM, as described in the Exper-
imental Procedures). Figure 1E shows representative images
of thrombus development within the internal carotid artery at
various time points following FeCl3 injury in a representative
mouse injected with either TMAO or vehicle (normal saline).
At the time of the carotid artery injury (2 hr following TMAO
i.p. injection), a >10-fold increase in plasma TMAO was
observed that is well within the (patho)physiological range
observed in humans (Figure 1E; 93.0 ± 12.5 mM versus 7.2 ±
0.5 mM TMAO in TMAO versus vehicle, respectively; p <
0.001; n R 5 per group). As can be seen in Figure 1E, the
rate
of
fluorescent
thrombus
formation
is
increased
by
TMAO. Further, the occlusion time, monitored by direct visual-
ization of when platelets cease to pass downstream of the
growing thrombus, is significantly (p < 0.001) shorter in
TMAO-injected mice (Figure 1F).
TMAO Promotes Platelet Hyperresponsiveness by
Enhancing Stimulus-Dependent Release of Ca2+ from
Intracellular Ca2+ Stores
Under resting conditions, platelets maintain a low intracellular
cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) level as they circulate through healthy
vessels. However, at sites of vessel injury, platelets are rapidly
activated by stimulus-dependent mobilization of [Ca2+]i, a pre-
cursor to thrombus formation and hemostasis (Rink and Sage,
1990; Furie and Furie, 2008). To explore how TMAO influences
platelet [Ca2+]i, washed platelets from healthy donors were
loaded with Fura 2-AM, a calcium-selective dye, to permit real
time monitoring of [Ca2+]i at rest and following stimulus-depen-
dent activation. Pre-incubation with TMAO showed no effect
on resting platelet [Ca2+]i (Figure 2A). However, exposure to
physiological
levels
of
TMAO
enhanced
sub-maximal
thrombin-evoked augmentation of platelet [Ca2+]i in a dose-
dependent manner (Figures 2A and 2B). In parallel studies
TMAO similarly increased a sub-maximal ADP-triggered (1 mM)
rise in platelet [Ca2+]i (Figures S2A and S2B). The stimulatory
effect of TMAO on platelet responsiveness to agonist was
observed to occur rapidly, since only brief exposure (10 min) to
TMAO significantly enhanced stimulus triggered rise in [Ca2+]i
(data not shown) and platelet aggregation (Figure S2C). To deter-
mine whether TMAO affects the release of Ca2+ from platelet
stores or the entry of Ca2+ from extracellular media, we first
examined [Ca2+]i in Fura 2-AM loaded platelets incubated with
sub-maximal thrombin dose in media in the absence of free
Ca2+ (and 0.1 mM EGTA was added to the medium) in the pres-
ence versus absence of TMAO. As seen in Figure 2C (left), under
these conditions, platelet activation in the presence of TMAO re-
sulted in an initial several-fold enhancement in the rise of [Ca2+]i,
indicating an intracellular source of Ca2+ is sufficient for TMAO-
induced augmentation in the stimulus-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i.
With sustained incubation in media containing excess Ca2+
chelator, platelet [Ca2+]i eventually plummets, consistent with
depletion of intracellular stores triggering plasma membrane
Ca2+ channel opening. Subsequent addition of excess Ca2+ to
the external media reveals a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, but
no significant effect of TMAO on Ca2+ entry rate from the extra-
cellular pool (Figures 2C and 2D). Finally, TMAO was seen to
augment inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathways
in platelets with either sub-maximal thrombin (Figure 2E) or
ADP (Figure 2F) as agonists by quantifying inositol phosphate
levels.

 Dietary Choline Enhances Platelet Responsiveness and
In Vivo Thrombosis Potential
Demonstration of a direct effect of TMAO on platelet function
suggests that gut microbiota and specific dietary nutrients that
enhance TMAO generation should similarly modulate platelet
function and thrombosis potential in vivo. To explore this possi-
bility, mice were placed on a chemically defined diet comparable
to normal chow (0.08% total choline) versus the same chemically
defined diet supplemented with either TMAO (0.12%) or choline
(1%). In addition, the effect of gut microbial suppression with a
cocktail of oral broad-spectrum, poorly absorbed antibiotics
(ABS) (Wang et al., 2011) was examined with both diets (Figure 3).
After 6 weeks, platelet-rich plasma was isolated from mice,
platelet responsiveness to ADP stimulation was determined us-
ing ex vivo platelet aggregometry, and TMAO levels were quan-
tified. Figure 3A shows a representative tracing from the platelet
aggregometry studies of a mouse from each dietary group using
1 mM ADP as agonist, while data in Figure 3B represent scatter-
plots and cumulative statistical analyses of percent maximal
aggregation results at the sub-maximal ADP dose as an agonist
for each of the dietary ± ABS groups of mice. Examination of

was
significantly
increased in these groups (Figure 3B).
Moreover, the enhancing effect of dietary
choline on platelet aggregation was sup-
pressed in mice receiving oral ABS, which
markedly reduces plasma TMAO levels (Figures 3A and 3B).
Importantly, provision of ABS to the TMAO supplemented group
did not have a significant effect on either plasma TMAO levels or
platelet aggregation (Figure 3B). Figure 3C illustrates parallel in-
dependent studies examining platelet activation in response to
different concentrations of ADP or different agonists (collagen
or arachidonic acid). Notably, TMAO supplementation similarly
enhanced ex vivo platelet aggregometry responses to sub-
maximal levels of each of the agonists examined (Figure 3C).
In further studies the impact of dietary choline, TMAO, and gut
microbiota on in vivo thrombosis potential was examined using
the carotid artery FeCl3 injury model using an overall study
design identical to that used for the ex vivo platelet aggregome-
try studies above (Figure 3D). Consistently, in vivo thrombosis
potential, as monitored by time to blood flow cessation in the ca-
rotid artery following FeCl3 injury, was shortened (indicating a
more pro-thrombotic phenotype) in mice with heightened
TMAO levels (choline or TMAO supplemented diet groups) (Fig-
ure 3D). Importantly, the effect of dietary choline on in vivo
thrombosis was inhibited by concurrent oral ABS administration,

 (Figure 3D; TMAO levels in Figure 3B). We also examined the
impact of each dietary intervention on platelet counts, along
with other metabolic parameters (Table S1), and saw no differ-
ences to account for the observed effects on in vivo thrombosis
potential. In a complementary set of studies, we employed
photochemical injury using rose bengal as a photosensitizing
agent as an alternative trigger of platelet activation and throm-
bosis in vivo (Figure 3E) (Furie and Furie, 2008). Mice were placed
on the chemically defined chow diet (0.08% total choline) versus
the same diet supplemented with either TMAO (0.12%) or
choline (1%) for 1 week, at which point rose bengal was injected,
the mid portion of the common carotid artery was illuminated
with a 1.5 mW green light laser, and blood flow was continuously
monitored by doppler, as described in the Experimental Proce-
dures. Notably, dietary TMAO or choline supplementation each
markedly increased plasma TMAO levels and was accompanied
by significant shortening of occlusion time (Figure 3E).
Next, we sought to determine whether the enhancing effect of
dietary choline supplementation on platelet function was due to
a factor(s) that was contained within platelet-poor plasma, as
anticipated for TMAO, or whether the platelets themselves
showed altered responsiveness when recovered from mice
chronically on the choline supplemented diet. Platelet-rich
plasma from each group of mice was recovered and then further
fractionated into a washed platelet versus platelet-poor plasma
fraction under ultracentrifugation conditions that also removed
microparticles and exosomes, as described in the Experimental
Procedures. As shown in Figure 3F, enhanced platelet aggrega-
tion responses in add-back/mixing studies revealed that the
hyperresponsive phenotype followed the choline diet-derived
platelet-poor plasma. In contrast, the source of the washed
platelets (chow versus choline diet fed animals) failed to impact
the overall extent of platelet aggregation monitored.

 in vivo thrombosis studies (FeCl3-induced carotid artery injury
model) using germ-free C57BL/6J mice housed under sterile
conditions, their conventional (microbe-colonized) counterparts,
or germ-free mice after conventionalization (housing in con-
ventional cages to permit microbe colonization). All mice were
maintained on the indicated diets for 6 weeks, and plasma was
recovered for TMAO analyses on the day of the in vivo throm-
bosis assay. As previously observed, conventional mice supple-
mented with either dietary choline or TMAO (relative to the
control (chow) group) showed significant increases in plasma
TMAO levels, and in parallel, enhanced thrombosis (reductions
in carotid artery time to cessation of blood flow following FeCl3
injury; Figure 4A). In contrast, within the germ-free mice, supple-
mentation with choline no longer produced TMA (and hence
TMAO) or the pro-thrombotic phenotype. Moreover, provision
of dietary TMAO within the germ-free mice (bypassing the
need for gut microbes to elevate TMAO) resulted in significant
shortening in the time to cessation of blood flow (Figure 4A).
Notably, germ-free mice that were subsequently conventional-

for 6 weeks, and then plasma TMAO levels, in vivo thrombosis
potential using the carotid artery injury model, and cecal micro-
bial composition were examined. Principal coordinates analysis

 to visualize whether community differences were observed be-

plemented
diets.
Distinct
(non-overlapping)
clusters
were
observed (Figure 4C; p < 0.001 for Student’s t test with 1,000
Monte Carlo simulations), suggesting chronic exposure to sup-
plemental dietary choline induced a significant rearrangement
in the overall cecal microbial composition. Linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe)
further identified cecal microbial taxa that accounted for the
greatest differences observed in mice on the distinct diets. In
total, eight taxa were identified through LEfSe analyses as
being characteristic of choline versus chow diet (Figure 4D),
where choline diet significantly increased proportions of three
genera (Figures S3A–S3C) and decreased five genera (Figures
S3D–S3H).
In further analyses of the detected cecal genera within all
groups of mice, nine taxa were identified whose proportions
were significantly associated with plasma TMAO levels (FDR
adjusted p % 0.1), and 15 taxa were identified whose propor-
tions were significantly associated with in vivo thrombosis po-
tential (i.e., occlusion time; FDR adjusted p % 0.1) (Figure S4A;
Table S2). The proportions of eight taxa were significantly asso-
ciated with both plasma TMAO levels and occlusion time, and in
every case, microbial taxa positively associated with higher
plasma TMAO levels were associated with shorter time to blood
flow cessation (more pro-thrombotic), whereas taxa significantly
associated with reduced TMAO levels were associated with
longer time to blood flow cessation (Figure S4A; Table S2). Inter-
estingly, the proportions of most of the identified bacterial taxa
characteristic of a high choline diet were also positively associ-
ated with a pro-thrombotic phenotype (shorter occlusion time).
For example, the proportion of Allobaculum, a high choline diet
characteristic taxa, was significantly positively associated with
TMAO levels and shortened internal carotid artery occlusion
times (Figure 4E, left; Figure S4). In contrast, alternative bacterial
taxa that showed significant reduction in proportion, such as
Candidatus Arthromitus or Lachnospiraceae, were associated
with both lower TMAO levels and an anti-thrombotic phenotype
(longer occlusion times) (Figure 4E, right; Figure S4).
Metagenomic
analyses
were
also
performed
following
shotgun sequencing of the cecal microbiota within mice from
each of the three diets. Over 6,000 species and strains were de-
tected altogether. Table S3 lists the KEGG pathways that were
present, indicating those that were identified in one or more sam-
ples and the significance of differences in abundance between
the diets, and Figure S5 summarizes microbial pathways signif-
icantly different between cecal microbes recovered from the
different dietary groups of mice. In addition to the choline utiliza-
tion gene cluster identified in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (Cra-
ciun and Balskus, 2012), several human gut microbiota reference
species associated with TMA production, encoding the CutC/
CutD, YeaW/X and CntA/B enzymes recently identified (Falony
et al., 2015; Koeth et al., 2014), were also observed. Table S4
lists all of those detected in one or more samples in our study,
as well as differences in abundance between the diets. In recent
studies Romano et al. (2015) examined 79 common gut microbe
isolates and tested these in vitro for choline consumption and
TMA production. Of these, eight were found to be TMA pro-
ducers, and all eight were present in the metagenomic data
from the mice in our study: Anaerococcus hydrogenalis, Clos-
tridium asparagiforme, Clostridium hathewayi, Clostridium spor-
agenes, Escherichia fergusonii, Proteus penneri, Providencia
rettgeri, and Edwardsiella tarda. Of these, only the first three
differed significantly between the chow and choline diets; how-
ever, surprisingly, these tended to be more abundant in mice
from the chow versus high choline diet groups (Table S4). These
results underscore the complex community dynamic operating
in vivo is more relevant to global TMA/TMAO production, as
opposed to the in vitro ability of an individual microbial species
to produce TMA from choline. Moreover, additional microbial
TMA lyases no doubt exist that can contribute to TMA/TMAO
production besides those already reported.
Cecal Microbial Transplantation Studies Demonstrate
Thrombosis Potential Is a Transmissible Trait
Next, we sought to test whether the effect of dietary choline on
thrombosis potential is transmissible with microbial transplanta-
tion (i.e., fulfillment of an essential Koch’s [1880] postulate). We
recently examined TMAO levels in a mouse diversity panel
comprised of over 20 different inbred strains of mice and identi-
fied C57BL/6J as a ‘‘high TMAO’’-producing atherosclerotic dis-
ease-prone strain and NZW/LacJ as a ‘‘low TMAO’’-producing
disease-resistant strain (Gregory et al., 2015). In addition, we
successfully used cecal contents from these inbred strains of
mice as donors of functionally distinct stable microbial commu-
nities in transplantation studies, revealing that both atheroscle-
rosis susceptibility and TMA/TMAO production are transmissible
traits (Gregory et al., 2015). Before further using these inbred
strains as donors in cecal microbial transplantation studies
exploring thrombosis potential, we thought it important to first
confirm that the high TMAO-producing strain (C57BL/6J)
showed shorter occlusion time (more pro-thrombotic pheno-
type) than the low TMAO-producing strain (NZW/LacJ), particu-
larly on a high choline diet. Conventional C57BL/6J and NZW/
LacJ mice were maintained for 6 weeks on chemically defined
chow (0.08% total choline) versus choline supplemented (1.0%
total choline) diets. On the day of in vivo thrombosis assay,
plasma TMAO levels in the C57BL/6J mice were over twice as
high as those observed in the NZW/LacJ mice on the corre-
sponding diet in both normal chow and choline-supplemented
diet arms of the study (Figure S6A). Interestingly, whereas a
choline-supplemented diet fed to C57BL/6J mice provoked a
significant pro-thrombotic phenotype (p = 0.0002 relative to
chow), the NZW/LacJ mice on the choline-supplemented
(versus chow) diet exhibited only a trend (p = 0.07) toward
reduced carotid artery occlusion time following FeCl3-induced
injury (Figure S6A).
Based on the above results, we proceeded with cecal micro-
bial transplantation studies using C57BL/6J (‘‘high TMAO,’’
‘‘pro-thrombotic’’) and NZW/LacJ (‘‘low TMAO,’’ ‘‘low throm-
botic’’) mice as cecal microbial donor strains and germ-free
mice (C57BL/6J) as recipients. For 6 weeks preceding the start
of the study, all mice (both donors and germ-free recipients)
were maintained on the chemically defined (sterile) chow diet.
Following cecal microbial transplantation, recipients were indi-
vidually housed in separate microisolators and maintained on

 sterile (irradiated) chow versus choline-supplemented diets, as
described in the Experimental Procedures (overall scheme is
shown in Figure 5A). Successful transplantation of differential mi-
crobial choline TMA lyase enzyme activity in the donors
(measured by conversion of d9-choline into d9-TMA in cecum)
was
observed
in
the
recipients

transplantation
(Figure 5B). In contrast, examination of hepatic FMO enzyme ac-
tivity, which is responsible for converting TMA into TMAO (Wang
et al., 2011; Bennett et al., 2013), revealed no significant differ-
ences between both donor mouse strains and among the various
recipient groups post-cecal microbial transplantation (Fig-
ure S6B). Results of plasma TMAO levels on the day of sacrifice,
platelet function (ex vivo platelet aggregometry), and in vivo
thrombosis potential (FeCl3 carotid artery injury model) in each
group of mice are shown in Figures 5C and 5D. First, as previ-
ously observed, germ-free recipients following microbial trans-

(D). (B, C, and D) Plasma TMAO levels (mean ±

studies. For significance, a Kruskal-Wallis test was
used for multiple group comparison, and a Mann-
Whitney test was used for two-group comparison.

plantation with C57BL/6J cecal contents
showed a significant �2-fold increase in
plasma TMAO levels compared to recipi-
ents on the comparable diets receiving
microbial transplantation with NZW/LacJ
cecal contents (Figures 5C and 5D).
Moreover, recipient mice following micro-
bial transplantation with C57BL/6J cecal
contents on the choline supplemented
diet showed �10-fold increase in plasma
TMAO level and accompanying enhanced
platelet responsiveness to sub-maximal
ADP dose during platelet aggregometry
studies compared with chow-fed controls
(p < 0.0001; Figure 5C). Similarly, recipients of the C57BL/6J
cecal
microbes
maintained
on
the
choline-supplemented
diet also showed significant shortening of time to blood flow
cessation during in vivo thrombosis assay (p < 0.0001; Fig-
ure 5D). In contrast, a blunted (relative to C57BL/6J) rise in
TMAO in the recipients receiving NZW/LacJ cecal microbes
and placed on choline-supplemented diet was observed,
with a correspondingly reduced effect of choline diet on both
platelet responsiveness and in vivo thrombosis potential (Figures
5C and 5D).

TMAO Levels and Thrombosis Potential
Cecal microbial composition in donors (on chow diet) and germ-
free recipients post transplantation on the distinct diets (chow
versus choline supplemented) was examined as before by

 sequencing microbial DNA encoding 16S ribosomal RNA and
performing principal coordinates analyses. Clear differences in
community structure were visualized between cecal microbes
recovered from the donors (Figure 6A). Further, following trans-
plantation, recipients of C57BL/6J cecal microbes showed cecal
microbial composition similar to the C57BL/6J donors, and re-
cipients of NZW/LacJ cecal microbes showed cecal microbial
composition similar to the NZW/LacJ donors (Figure 6A). In addi-
tion, exposure to the high choline diet induced a shift in commu-
nity composition within each recipient group, but the differences
between (and similarities with their respective donor) the micro-
bial community compositions in the respective recipients re-
mained visible (Figure 6A).
In further studies we examined whether the proportions of any
cecal taxa in recipient mice from the above microbial transplan-
tation study were significantly correlated with either plasma
TMAO levels or in vivo thrombosis potential (occlusion time) at

proportions of several taxa previously
identified in analyses of mice on chow
versus choline-supplemented diets as
being associated with TMAO levels and
in vivo thrombosis potential (Figures 4E
and S4; Table S2) were again observed
to be significantly associated with TMAO
levels and occlusion time. Specifically,
proportions of three taxa in recipient cecal
microbes were identified when grouped
by dietary treatment as again being signif-
icantly
associated
with
both
plasma
TMAO levels and occlusion time (Allobac-
ulum with TMAO, p < 0.0001 and with
occlusion time, p = 0.01; Figure S7B;

0.007; Figure S7C; Lachnospiraceae with TMAO, p < 0.0001
and with occlusion time, p = 0.01; Figure S7D).
Next, LEfSe analyses was performed to identify cecal micro-
bial taxa that account for the greatest differences between
C57BL/6J and NZW/LacJ donor mice (Figure 6B), and the rela-
tionships of these donor characteristic taxa with both plasma
TMAO and in vivo thrombosis potential examined in recipients
following cecal microbial transplantation. Interestingly, of the
ten taxa identified as characteristic for C57BL/6J donors (Fig-
ure 6B; taxa depicted in red), examination of these in recipient
cecal microbes revealed that the proportions of seven taxa either
trended or were significantly positively associated with TMAO
and negatively with time to cessation of flow (i.e., associated
with a more ‘‘pro-thrombotic’’ phenotype). Genus Prevotella
and order YS2 from the Cyanobacteria phylum are examples of
C57BL/6J donor characteristic taxa identified by the LEfSe ana-
lyses that in recipients were positively associated (after FDR

 adjustment) with TMAO and negatively with time to occlusive
clot formation (Figures 6C and 6D). In similar analyses, of the
14 taxa identified as being characteristic of the NZW/LacJ do-
nors in LEfSe analyses (Figure 6B; taxa depicted in blue), when
examined in recipient cecal microbes, the proportions of eight
taxa either trended or were significantly negatively associated
with TMAO levels and positively associated with time to
cessation of flow (i.e., less thrombotic phenotype). The genus
Peptococcaceae is an example of a taxa identified as being
characteristic of the NZW/LacJ donors and that was observed
to be both significantly negatively associated with TMAO levels
and positively associated with in vivo time to occlusive clot for-
mation within recipients (Figure 6E).
DISCUSSION
The present studies reveal the interesting finding that gut mi-
crobes modulate thrombosis potential in vivo. They also expand
our understanding of the relationship between TMAO and CVD
risk. The TMAO meta-organismal pathway has been shown to
possess numerous clinical and mechanistic links (Figure 7A)
with both atherosclerotic plaque development and whole-body
cholesterol and sterol metabolism (Wang et al., 2011; Koeth
et al., 2013, 2014; Gregory et al., 2015; Miao et al., 2015; Shih
et al., 2015; Warrier et al., 2015). Moreover, circulating levels of
TMAO have been shown in multiple distinct clinical studies and
cohorts to be associated with CVD risks (Wang et al., 2011,
2014a; Tang et al., 2013, 2015; Lever et al., 2014; Trøseid et al.,
2015), and targeted suppression of microbial TMA/TMAO pro-
duction has recently been shown to inhibit diet-induced athero-
sclerosis (Wang et al., 2015). The present studies expand on
these findings and show that gut microbes, via generation of
TMAO, can directly modulate platelet hyperresponsiveness and
clot formation rate in vivo. A scheme illustrating the overall
involvement of gut microbes and the TMAO meta-organismal
pathway in platelet hyperresponsiveness and in vivo thrombosis
potential, a critical determinant of patient vulnerability for adverse
cardiac event risk, is illustrated in Figure 7A. Also shown are
known effects of the gut microbial TMAO pathway on CVD,
including the recent demonstration of adverse ventricular remod-
eling and heart failure risk (Organ et al., 2015) and arterial endo-
thelial cell activation in vivo (Seldin et al., 2016). The influence of
gut microbes on thrombosis risk via TMAO production requires
the presenceof an appropriate dietaryinputcapableofproducing
TMA (e.g., foods rich in choline or phosphatidylcholine), the pre-
cursor for TMAO generation. Further, an obligatory role of gut
microbes in choline diet-enhanced thrombosis was confirmed
both in studies using germ-free mice and in conventional mouse
studies in the presence versus absence of oral poorly absorbed
broad spectrum antibiotics. Cecal microbial transplantation
studies confirm that both choline diet-enhanced platelet respon-
siveness and in vivo thrombosis potential are transmissible traits.
Finally, the results of large-scale human clinical studies with over
4,000 subjects underscore the potential clinical significance of
the pathway, since elevated TMAO levels are independently
associated with incident risk for thrombotic events (myocardial
infarction or stroke) in subjects, even following adjustments for
multiple risk factors, medication use, and CVD status.
The mechanisms through which dietary choline influences
platelet responsiveness and function, impacting overall in vivo
thrombosis risk, are illustrated in Figure 7B. First, a diet rich in
choline alters microbial composition and function. Specifically,
with choline supplementation, total cecal microbial choline
TMA lyase activity was shown to increase, with parallel increases
in both plasma TMAO levels and proportions of specific taxa
associated with TMAO. The present studies also show that the
effect of TMAO on platelet hyperresponsiveness is not stimulus
specific; rather, multiple distinct agonists, including ADP,
thrombin, collagen, and arachidonic acid, all showed TMAO-
dependent enhancement in Ca2+ release from platelet intracel-
lular stores and activation in the setting of sub-maximal agonist
stimulation (Figure 7B). In addition, studies examining the effect
of TMAO on IP3 generation in platelets, a second messenger
signaling molecule produced by various phospholipase C iso-
forms that triggers intracellular Ca2+ release leading to platelet
activation, similarly showed TMAO-dependent enhancement.
These observations collectively suggest the site of TMAO action
in platelets is at a molecular level at, or proximal to, this step.
Importantly, the effect of TMAO on platelet function was also
dose dependent across the physiological range of TMAO con-
centrations observed in both humans and in animal models.
Finally, the effect of TMAO on platelet reactivity and in vivo
thrombosis was observed to be both rapid and reversible.
Despite the numerous findings and mechanistic insights re-
vealed regarding the impact of TMAO on platelet function, the
‘‘chemical sensor’’ for TMAO within platelets remains unknown.
Indeed, a receptor for TMAO in eukaryotic cells has not yet
been reported. In contrast, TMA is a well-known ligand for an ol-
factory G protein-coupled receptor, trace amine-associated re-
ceptor 5 (TAAR5), which is specific for TMA and dimethylamine,
but reportedly does not recognize either TMAO or numerous
alternative methylamines (Wallrabenstein et al., 2013). Since
orally ingested TMAO can in part be converted back to TMA by
gut microbes, one might speculate that TMA, and thus TAAR5,
might participate in the observed platelet phenotype. However,
results of platelet aggregometry studies with direct addition of
chemically pure TMAO, as well as studies employing germ-free
mice and dietary TMAO supplementation, both strongly indicate
that it is TMAO itself, and not TMA, that mediates the observed
platelet hyperresponsiveness ex vivo and the pro-thrombotic
phenotype in vivo. Whether there is a dedicated receptor on the
platelets for TMAO or TMAO instead acts as an allosteric modu-
lator of existing signaling pathways is unknown. TMAO is known
to function as a small-molecule chaperone mimetic, influencing
protein conformation and function. Studies with isotope-labeled
TMAO reveal it can enter cells (data not shown), but its site of
action in modulating platelet function is at present unknown. Bio-
physically, TMAO is rather unique and possesses both hydro-
phobic and hydrophilic properties and the known ability to alter
protein confirmation and stability (Brown et al., 1997; Singh
et al., 2007). Discovery of the molecular receptor(s) that senses
TMAO within cells like platelets is an area of intense interest.
In summary, the present work reveals the clinically relevant
discovery that gut microbes, via generation of TMAO, participate
in modulating platelet function and generation of a pro-throm-
botic phenotype in vivo. The results thus suggest new potential

 therapeutic targets and refinement of nutritional interventions for
the prevention of adverse cardiovascular event risk. It is remark-
able that numerous large-scale epidemiological studies have
noted a relationship between a western diet, which is enriched
in known nutrient TMAO precursors (e.g., choline, phosphatidyl-
choline, and carnitine), and an enhanced risk for myocardial
infarction, stroke, and death (Iqbal et al., 2008; Rohrmann
et al., 2013). It also is relevant that anti-platelet agents are a
cornerstone of current pharmacological interventions for the
treatment and prevention of acute complications of CVD. These
interventions are, however, hampered by their potential for
bleeding as a complication (Jennings, 2009). The present studies
suggest that targeting the gut microbial TMAO pathway as a
treatment strategy, whether it be via dietary manipulation, alter-
ation in microbial community with a probiotic or prebiotic, or
direct pharmacological inhibition of microbial enzymes involved
in TMA production, has the potential to temper platelet hyperres-
ponsiveness associated with elevated TMAO. Moreover, such
pharmacological interventions would, in contrast to existing
anti-platelet agents, be expected to reduce platelet hyperres-
ponsiveness to normal range, and not induce impairment in over-
all platelet function. Thus, one could speculate that targeting this
microbial pathway would foster a beneficial ‘‘anti-platelet’’ ef-
fect,
attenuating
pro-thrombotic
tendencies,
but
without
enhanced bleeding complications as a consequence. Studies
into this possibility represent an attractive future area of investi-
gation. Further examination of the clinical utility of TMAO levels
as an indication of subjects who may benefit from anti-platelet
prophylaxis therapy with low-dose aspirin or other platelet-
directed antithrombotic drugs is also an area of considerable
interest.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
More complete experimental procedures are provided in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
General Procedures and Reagents
Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Protein con-
centration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) assay (Bio-
Rad). Hepatic FMO activity was quantified as described previously (Bennett
et al., 2013). Mouse plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured
using Abbott ARCHITECT platform model ci8200 (Abbott Diagnostics).
Ethical Considerations
All animal model studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at the Cleveland Clinic. All study protocols and informed con-
sent for human subjects were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional
Review Board. Informed consents were obtained from all subjects.
Mass Spectrometry Quantification of Plasma and Dietary Analytes
Stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) was used for quantification of plasma TMA and TMAO, as well
as the content of free ant total choline of all chemically defined diets, as previ-
ously described (Wang et al., 2011, 2014b).
Human Studies
The association between TMAO levels and incident thrombotic event risk was
examined in the GeneBank Study (Tang et al., 2013). Platelets from consenting
healthy volunteers were drawn into citrate tubes. Donors were pre-screened
and confirmed to have fasting TMAO < 2.5 mM the day of blood draw.
Platelet-rich plasma, isolated human platelets, and aggregometry studies
were performed as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Thrombosis studies in whole blood at physiological levels of shear stress
were performed using the Cellix Microfluidics System (Cellix) with computer
image-assisted quantification of adherent platelets as described in the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures. Inositol phosphate levels were quantified
using the IP-One ELISA Kit (Cisbio Bioassays) in accordance with the manu-
facturer’s instruction.
In Vivo Carotid Artery Thrombosis Models
Two in vivo thrombosis models were used. Mice were typically placed for
6 weeks on the indicated chemically defined diets (± oral broad-spectrum an-
tibiotics provided in the drinking water, where indicated) as previously
described (Wang et al., 2011). For most studies, mice were subjected to com-
mon carotid artery injury by application of 10% FeCl3 for 1 min (Chen et al.,
2008). In alternative studies, a photochemical carotid artery injury model
was used as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. In
some experiments, plasma TMAO was acutely elevated by intraperitoneal in-
jection (100 ml) of sterile stock solution (290 mM final in sterile water, pH
adjusted to 7.4 using 0.1 N HCl) or sterile normal saline, and the carotid artery
thrombosis model was performed 2 hr later.
Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements
Ratiometric fluorescence measurements were conducted with 8 3 108
washed human platelets resuspended in Hank’s buffered salt solution supple-
mented with bovine serum albumin and glucose and after incubation with Fura
2-AM (1 mM) and removal of unabsorbed FURA 2-AM. Changes in [Ca2+]i were
monitored by measuring Fura 2-AM fluorescence using 340/380 nm dual-
wavelength excitation and an emission of 510 nm, as described in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Germ-free Mouse Studies
Germ-free C57BL/6J female mice bred and housed at the National Gnotobiotic
Rodent Resource Center, University of North Carolina (UNC) were used in
various studies. Mice were exposed to 3 weeks of the indicated chemically
defined sterile diets as described in the Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures. Conventionalization of germ-free mice and microbial transplantation
studies were performed as described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Microbiota Studies
Cecal microbial community composition was assessed by sequencing 16S
rRNA gene amplicons (Gregory et al., 2015), and metagenomic analyses were
performed as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures,
following shotgun sequencing of cecal microbes. Metagenomic data are depos-
ited in MG-RAST-Argonne National Laboratory (http://metagenomics.anl.gov/)
and can be accessed through project name: Platelet function and TMAO.
Statistical Analysis
Detailed statistical methods are described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures. All studies were repeated at least three independent times with
the number of biological replicates (animal numbers) for a given experiment
shown. Kaplan-Meier survival plots and Cox proportional hazards analysis
were used to determine Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) for thrombotic event (MI and stroke) risk stratified according to
TMAO quartiles. Adjustments were made for individual traditional risk factors
(B) Chronic exposure to a diet rich in choline leads to a shift in the gut microbial composition and function, with consequent enhancement in host TMAO plasma
