SUMMARY
T helper type 2 (Th2) cells are important regulators
of mammalian adaptive immunity and have rele-
vance for infection, autoimmunity, and tumor immu-
nology. Using a newly developed, genome-wide
retroviral CRISPR knockout (KO) library, combined
with RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq, we have
dissected the regulatory circuitry governing activa-
tion and differentiation of these cells. Our experi-
ments distinguish cell activation versus differentia-
tion in a quantitative framework. We demonstrate
that these two processes are tightly coupled and
are jointly controlled by many transcription factors,
metabolic genes, and cytokine/receptor pairs. There
are only a small number of genes regulating differen-
tiation without any role in activation. By combining
biochemical and genetic data, we provide an atlas
for Th2 differentiation, validating known regulators
and identifying factors, such as Pparg and Bhlhe40,
as part of the core regulatory network governing Th2
helper cell fates.
INTRODUCTION
CD4+ T helper (Th) cells are a central part of the adaptive im-
mune system. During immune response, Th cells transform
from a naive state into different effector subtypes, including
T helper type 1 cells (Th1), Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cells
(Treg). Different subtypes have distinct functions and molecular
characteristics (Zhu et al., 2010). Th2 cells are primarily involved
in eliminating helminths and other parasites and are strongly
associated with allergies.
Th2 differentiation is characterized by the production of the
cytokines Il4, Il5, and Il13. In vitro, Il4 is crucial for the activation
of the signaling transducer Stat6 (Kaplan et al., 1996; Chen et al.,
2003; Elo et al., 2010), which induces the Th2 master regulator
Gata3 (Swain et al., 1990). Gata3 activates Il4, forming a positive
feedback loop (Zheng & Flavell 1997). Th1 cells possess an
equivalent feedback mechanism for their defining transcription
factor (TF), Tbx21, which represses Gata3. Gata3 is able to inhibit
Ifng, the main cytokine driving Th1 differentiation. Thus, the bal-
ance of the two TFs Tbx21 and Gata3 defines the Th1-Th2 axis
(Kanhere et al., 2012). There are, however, many genes affecting
this balance, and alternative Th fates are frequently affected by
overlapping sets of regulatory genes. All T cell fates require acti-
vation via the T cell receptor and a co-stimulatory molecule, for
example, CD28. Additional signaling via cytokines then deter-
mines the adapted T cell fate. Therefore, a delineation of activa-
tion versus differentiation is critical for our understanding of
Th subtype development. Despite the importance of different
T helper subtypes, so far only the Th17 subtype has been exam-
ined systematically (Ciofani et al., 2012). Here, we dissect Th2
differentiation with a special emphasis on differentiation versus
activation signals.
A major challenge in performing genetic studies in primary
mouse T cells is the lack of efficient genetic perturbation tools.
To date, only a small-scale RNA interference screen has been
performed in vivo on mouse T cells (Chen et al., 2014). However,
recently developed CRISPR technology has the advantages of
higher specificity and greater flexibility, allowing knockout,
repression, and activation (Adli 2018). Currently, all existing
CRISPR libraries are lentiviral-based and therefore unable to
infect murine Th cells (Baumann et al., 2004). To overcome this
limitation, we created a genome-wide retroviral CRISPR small
guide RNA (sgRNA) library. By using this library on T cells from
mice constitutively expressing Cas9, we obtained high knockout
efficiency. In addition, we established an arrayed CRISPR
screening protocol that is scalable and cost efficient.
After library transduction, we screened for and characterized
genes strongly affecting Th2 differentiation and activation, with
Il4, Il13, Gata3, Irf4, and Xbp1 as our primary screen readouts.
Il4, Il13, and Gata3 are at the core of Th2 differentiation (Kanhere
et al., 2012), while Irf4 and Xbp1 have been suggested to have

 supporting roles in keeping the chromatin accessible and in
overcoming the stress response associated with rapid protein
synthesis during T cell activation (Li et al., 2012; Kemp et al.,
2013; Pramanik et al., 2018). Gata3 is involved in both activation
and differentiation, as mice deficient in Gata3 are unable to
generate single-positive CD4 T cells, which requires activation
via the T cell receptor (TCR) (Pai et al., 2003). However, Gata3
also has a well-established role in regulating the Th1 or Th2 dif-
ferentiation axis. Selected genes discovered by the screen were
validated in individual knockouts (KOs) and assayed by RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq). To place the discovered genes into the
context of Th2 differentiation, we profiled developing Th2 cells
using RNA-seq for gene expression, ATAC-seq (assay for trans-
posase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) for chromatin
accessibility, and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing) of three key TFs: GATA3, IRF4, and BATF. We
further acquired corresponding data from human donors to
study the conservation of the regulatory pathways.
A genome-wide assessment of gene regulatory function was
performed by combining state-of-the-art transcriptional gene
regulatory network analysis, literature curation, and genome-
wide screen enrichment. Selected hits were validated in individ-
ual KO and overexpression experiments. The function of key
regulators of Th2 differentiation was further explored by perform-
ing additional ChIP-seq experiments. We characterize genes in
terms of their impact on activation and differentiation and pro-
vide a comprehensive, multi-factor model for Th2 cell fate deter-
mination. For ease of visualization, the integrated dataset is
provided online at http://www.teichlab.org/data/.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Screens Reveal Genes
Driving Primary Mouse Th2 Differentiation
Figure 1 depicts an overview of our experimental approach. First,
a high-complexity retroviral sgRNA library was generated (Fig-
ure 1B). We activated naive CD4+ T cells, purified from mouse
spleens, with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 together with IL4 at day
0. On day 1, T cells were transduced with the retroviral libraries
and selected with puromycin from day 3. After dead cell removal,
the screens were carried out on day 4. A general protocol is
supplied as Data S1.
Our screening strategy used two different approaches. For Il4,
Il13, Xbp1, and Gata3, we used T cells from transgenic mice
carrying a fluorescent reporter driven by the promoter of the
respective genes. In this protocol, cell populations with high or
low fluorescence were enriched with sgRNAs for genes inhibiting
or promoting Th2 cell differentiation, respectively. In addition, we
carried out screens in which T cells were stained with antibodies
for IRF4, XBP1, or GATA3. Most CRISPR screens to date are
‘‘drop-out’’ screens where the sgRNAs from an early time point
are compared to those in the final surviving cell population. In
contrast, here we identify differentiation-related genes by
comparing the sgRNAs in the selected target-high versus
target-low fractions. We will refer to the most highly enriched
or depleted genes (defined in more detail below) as ‘‘hits.’’
In total, we carried out 11 genetic screens and analyzed these
using the CRISPR screen hit-calling software MAGeCK (Li et al.,
2014) and compared this method to an orthogonal hit-calling
method BaIOPSE (Bayesian inference of pooled screen enrich-
ment [Figure 2B], further described in Data S1). Qualitatively,
we find that there is reasonable overlap between MAGeCK and
BaIOPSE (BaIOPSE scores in Data S2). Figure 2A shows the
hits in a screen using anti-Gata3 antibody staining (i.e., sgRNA
for specific target genes), ranked by MAGeCK p value, against
the fold change (Th2, 0 h versus 72 h, described later) of those
sgRNA targeted genes. As expected, Gata3 is recovered as a
top hit in its own screen. Another top hit is a known signal trans-
ducer from the IL4 receptor to Gata3, the TF Stat6. Previous work
has shown Stat6 to be required for the majority of Th2 response
genes in mouse and human (Chen et al., 2003; Elo et al., 2010).
This gives us confidence that relevant genes are recovered.
In a gene ontology (GO) analysis of top hits from all screens
(Figure 2C), the categories for calcium and MAPK signaling
have the lowest p values. While BaIOPSE allows a more consis-
tent integration of multiple screen replicates than MAGeCK, we
use MAGeCK for the remainder of this paper because of its
pre-existing community acceptance and because BaIOPSE re-
lies on informative priors.
In all subsequent descriptions of hits, we will refer to the
expression of the targeted gene, rather than the level of sgRNA
enrichment or depletion. For the sake of brevity, in this paper
we will use the nomenclature X/y, when gene X is in the top
5% of hits in the screen Y, either positively or negatively en-
riched. If gene X falls within the top 1% of ranked hits, we denote
this as X/y!. A comprehensive list of all gene hits is included in
Data S2, and results are summarized in Figure 2D.
Next, we identified hits that were consistent between screens
(see STAR Methods for details). Some genes appear to have a
particularly strong impact on Th2 development as they are seen
in multiple screens. Some affect both activation regulators (Irf4,
Xbp1, Gata3) and differentiation regulators (Gata3, Il4, Il13). This
includes the known genes Il27ra/Il4,Il13! and Lag3/Il4,Il13,Xbp1!
but also genes not previously connected to T cells, e.g.,
Trappc12/Il4!,Irf4,Gata3!,
Mpv17l2/Il4!,Il13!,Xbp1,
and
the
TF
Pou6f1/Il4!,Gata3. The cytokine-like gene Ccdc134/Il4!,Irf4!,Gata3 is
also a major hit. It has so far received little attention in the literature
but has been linked to arthritis (Xia et al., 2017) and shown to
promote CD8+ T cell effector functions (Huang et al., 2014). In
short, we have discovered many genes with a broad effect
on Th2
differentiation
and activation that deserve further
investigation.
Time Course Analysis of Gene Expression and Human-
Mouse Comparison Highlight Metabolic Genes
To place our hits into the context of Th2 development, we gener-
ated in vitro time course data during mouse and human Th cell
activation and differentiation (Figure 3A). Mouse and human pri-
mary Th cells were isolated from spleen and cord blood, respec-
tively, and activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Upon addition
of IL4, these cells matured into Th2 cells, while absence of IL4
resulted in activated ‘‘Th0’’ cells, which proliferate but do not
differentiate into a Th subtype. We performed time course bulk
RNA-seq profiling on Th2 and Th0 and ATAC-seq at several
time points during Th2 differentiation. The large number of
data points allowed us to reconstruct the trajectory of Th2

 differentiation by principal component analysis (PCA), using
RNA-seq data or ATAC-seq data alone (Figures 3B and 3C).
When carrying out differential gene expression (DE) analysis
between the murine Th0 and Th2 populations, we split the time
course into the early or fine-grained (0–6 h) period and a late or
coarse-grained period (0 h + 6–72 h), as shown in Figure 3A.
The number of DE genes is shown in Figure 3D. Importantly, a
sizeable fraction of these (21%) were also identified in at least
one of our genetic screens, providing orthogonal evidence for
their importance (DE scores are in Data S2).
We carried out an equivalent RNA-seq analysis across ten
time points in cultured human primary T cells. Fewer DE genes
were identified, possibly because genetic diversity between indi-
viduals may obscure some gene expression changes, but more
than one-fifth of the human DE genes had direct orthologs in the
mouse response (Figure 3E). We will refer to any gene being DE
in either human or mouse, at any time, as simply DE.
A total of 216 genes were DE in both mouse and human,
either early or late (p = 10�4). DE genes that also are top
hits in our CRISPR screens are shown in Figure 3D. We note
Figure 1. Overview of the Experimental KO Screening Strategy
(A) In our culture system, naive, ex vivo T cells are differentiated into Th2 cells by IL4. Potential alternative T cell fates that may be open to genetically perturbed
cells are indicated. In vivo, T cells develop into different subtypes dependent on stimuli.
(B) The retrovirus is based on murine stem cell virus (MSCV), encoding one sgRNA per virus, and allows for BFP and puro selection. For the screening we have
used a pool of plasmids, encoding over 86,000 sgRNAs, from all of which we produced viruses. The library is subcloned from a previous mouse sgRNA library
(Tzelepis et al., 2016).
(C) For genome-wide screens, we pool cells from up to 30 mice. After infection and puromycin selection, the cells are sorted based on fluorescence for the
investigated gene. sgRNAs affecting gene expression are identified by genomic PCR. Differential sgRNA expression analysis then allows us to find genes
affecting either viability (drop-out screen) or differentiation.
(D) The top enriched and depleted genes (‘‘hits’’) were analyzed based on their dynamics measured by RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq.
(E) Particularly interesting genes were further validated by individual KO and RNA-seq.
(F) By using all this data and curating the literature, we provide a Th2 gene regulatory network.

 the presence of the well-known cytokines Ccl17/Il4,Il13,Xbp1,
Il13/Il4,Xbp1, and Il2/Irf4,Gata3 and its receptor Il2rb/Irf4 and
the TFs Gata3/Xbp1!,Gata3!, Tbx21/Il13,Xbp1, and Pparg/Il13,Gata3.
Several of these are canonical Th2 genes, but many other genes
were also noted. Several of these are related to metabolism,
such as Pparg, which is thought to signal through mTOR (mech-
anistic target of rapamycin) and control fatty acid uptake (Angela
et al., 2016). Another metabolic gene, related to fatty acid trans-
port (Dean et al., 2001), with a strong phenotype in our screen is

 Th1 repressor Mapkapk3/Il4,Gata3! is also a metabolic gene (Ko
¨ -
ther et al., 2014).
Other hits have more diverse functions in T cell develop-
ment. Hits include the known T cell regulator Stat-inhibitor
Socs1/Irf4,Xbp1. The Il13 hit Rasgrp1/Il13,Irf4 is known to be
involved in T cell maturation (Priatel et al., 2002) and links
guanyl to the RAS pathway. Interestingly the guanylate-bind-
ing protein, Gbp4/Il13, is also an Il13 hit (but with higher DE
p value). The Il4 candidate regulator Uhrf1bp1l/Il4 has been
connected to hypomyelination but could act through the chro-
matin regulator Uhrf1, which is required for Treg maturation
(Obata et al., 2014).
In conclusion, a human-mouse comparison of DE genes
highlights cytokines and TFs known to be important for both
Th2 activation and differentiation and suggests additional
hits in our screens that are likely to be of functional impor-
tance, in particular genes that act as metabolic regulators
(e.g., Abcd3).
Analysis of Chromatin Dynamics Reveals Different TF
Binding Patterns during Activation and Differentiation
To gain further insight into the regulation of gene expression, we
examined chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq. We per-
formed ATAC-seq of developing Th2 cells at 0, 2, 4 24, 48, and
72 h time points in both human and mouse (Figure 3A). The chro-
matin of naive T cells is condensed until activation. It has previ-
ously been shown that some TFs, for example, Stat5, can only
access the promoters of its target genes after T cell activation
(Rawlings et al., 2011). Th2 differentiation is classically thought
to be driven by Stat6, which in turn upregulates Gata3. We exam-
ined these dynamics over the time course of the Th2 response.
The ATAC peaks were first called using MACS2. Overall, there
is a massive gain of chromatin accessibility from 0 to 2 h (Fig-
ure S1). After this initial opening, the chromatin appears to recon-
dense continuously, as indicated by the reduced total number of
ATAC-seq peaks at each successive time point. We speculate
that the regulatory network shifts from a general T cell network

 to subtype-specific network and that cell identity becomes less
plastic and less responsive to external perturbation over time.
We next compared TF binding predictions between human
and mouse. Using FIMO (find individual motif occurrences), we
predicted TF-binding sites within ATAC-seq peaks. To reduce
the number of potential false-positive peaks, we concentrated
on ATAC peaks that are conserved between mouse and human
by calculating the percentage of overlapping peaks between
species (10%–15%) (Figure 3E) and used these conserved bind-
ing sites for the rest of the analysis.
For different TFs, we examined how ATAC peaks, in which the
relevant TF motif is found, are changing over time (Figure 3F). As
expected for Th2, chromatin accessibility over GATA3 motifs
increases strongly with time, correlating with the increase in
GATA3 abundance (confirmed by western blot [Figure S2] and
RNA-seq [Data S2]). However, the (composite) motif that is
most associated with relative peak size increase is BATF::JUN.
This is consistent with the suggestion that BATF can act as a
pioneer factor to open chromatin (Ciofani et al., 2012). The func-
tional importance of Baft and/or Jun is supported by our genetic
screens: Jun/Il13, Fos/Irf4,Xbp1, and Fosl2/Gata3! are all associ-
ated with increasing peak height. Since Jun and/or Fos and
Fosl2 all recognize the same AP-1 motif, the exact TF composi-
tion at these peaks is likely to depend on their expression level.
Notably, Fosl2 expression is highest at the time points of 1 and
2 h in Th0 or Th2, with largely similar levels across Th1, Th2,
Th17, or Treg subtypes (Stubbington et al., 2015). Overexpres-
sion of Fosl2 has been shown to block IL17A production in
Th17 by competing for AP-1 sites (Ciofani et al., 2012), but over-
all Fosl2 expression is low in lymphoid cells (Uhle
´ n et al., 2015).
Fos and Jun are transiently expressed during the first 6 h. Jund,
another classical AP-1 factor, displays slowly increasing expres-
sion over time. As most AP-1 factors are expressed at low levels,
Batf, whose expression increases continuously, is the most likely
driver behind these peaks.
At the other extreme, some TF motifs are overrepresented in
peaks that decrease over time, such as Hoxd9/Il4, Atf3/Gata3,
Atf4/Il4!, Foxj2/Gata3, Dmbx1/Irf4, Foxa2/Il4!, Foxo3/Il4, and
Foxc2/Il13!. Several of these TFs also have low or decreasing
expression levels. We have previously shown that Atf3/Gata3
positively regulates Ifng (File
´ n et al., 2010) and promotes Th1 dif-
ferentiation in humans. Atf4/Il4! has been shown to be important
for Th1 function as stress regulator (Xia et al., 2015), but its
impact on Il4 extends this claim to Th2. Foxo1/Il13!,Xbp1! is a
highly expressed TF, but peaks containing this motif are also de-
caying. Foxo1 has recently been shown to inhibit H3K27me3
deposition at pro-memory T cell genes (Gray et al., 2017).
Foxj2 has similar behavior to Foxo1 but has not been studied
in T cells.
Inferred STAT6-binding sites were also compared with previ-
ous mouse and human data (Elo et al., 2010; Chen et al.,
2003), and we found that the vast majority of the previous target
genes are also DE in our time course analysis. A list of all TFs and
the average height of peaks containing their cognate motif is
provided in Data S2.
To further characterize the dynamics of the Th2 response, we
generated ChIP-seq data at several time points (Figure 3A) for
the Th2 master regulator GATA3, as well as BATF and IRF4.
We created a mouse strain with a 3xFLAG-mCherry GATA3
construct (T2A fusion; Figure S3) for this purpose (see STAR
Methods for details). The ChIP-seq peaks for Batf and Irf4
have a large overlap as previously reported (Ciofani et al.,
2012) (Figure 3G) (Jaccard index = 0.35). However, we saw no
significant overlap of these two factors with GATA3 (Jaccard in-
dex = 0.028 and 0.032), suggesting that any synergistic function
between GATA3 and BATF and/or IRF4 is not due to direct pro-
tein-protein contact. MEME (multiple EM for motif elicitation)
was applied to the sequences in the GATA3 peaks to find
other potential binding partners, and we found enrichment of
YY1/Il4,Il13,Xbp1,Gata3 (p = 2.5 3 10�58) binding motifs. This is
consistent with previous reports that Yy1 is required but not suf-
ficient for Th2 cytokine expression (Hwang et al., 2013). Indeed,
ATAC-seq peaks containing the YY1 motif are stable or decrease
slightly (Figure 3f). This finding, together with the identification
of Yy1 as a strong hit in our screen, reiterates Yy1 as a key sup-
porter, but not driver, of Th2 differentiation.
Focusing on GATA3 with its 10,203 peaks, a GO term analysis
of its nearby genes yielded ‘‘natural killer cell activation’’ (p = 6 3
10�3) but included few other immune-related terms. This is likely
due to the fact that Gata3 has distinct roles in other cell types
(Wei et al., 2011; Van de Walle et al., 2016) (a survey has shown
that its expression is highest in breast cancer cell lines [Uhle

et al., 2015]). Since we performed time course ChIP-seq, we
were able to selectively investigate peaks based on their dy-
namics. We calculated the ChIP peak height ratio at 72 h versus
24 h and defined the most increasing or decreasing GATA3
peaks as the top and bottom 1,000 peaks ordered by ratio.
Genes near peaks decreasing over time were not linked to any
particular immune-related GO terms, but a GO term enrichment
for genes near increasing peaks revealed ‘‘defense to bacte-
rium’’ or ’’viral life cycle’’ (p = 5 3 10�3) as the top term and
included other terms such as ‘‘myeloid leukocyte activation’’
(p = 2 3 10�2). A ranking of peaks and nearby genes, as well
as GO terms, are provided in Data S2.
Overall, the early change in ATAC-seq peak size reflects a
rapid increase in accessibility for all TFs, that is further increased
for specific Th2-related TFs (e.g., Batf/Jun, Gata3), followed by a
progressive loss of peaks as the cells differentiate. Interestingly,
our screen hits were found in both categories of TFs and may be
functionally important as either activators or repressors for the
specific T helper type.
Motif Activity Analysis Quantifies Transcription Factors
Controlling Activation versus Differentiation
To gain a broader perspective on how genes affect differentia-
tion and activation, we chose to perform a network analysis to
compare their downstream effects. For this purpose, we used
the ISMARA (Balwierz et al., 2014) algorithm, which builds a
network by linking TFs to potential target genes based on the
presence of the relevant motif in an ATAC-seq peak within the
vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS) of that target gene
(Figure 4A). In short, a TF has a high motif activity response anal-
ysis (MARA) activity score if the TF consistently explains the up-
regulation of all its putative downstream genes (or negative
score, if it is a suppressor). Interestingly, we found a very high
correlation in the predicted networks using ATAC-seq and
Cell 176, 882–896, February 7, 2019
887
 ChIP-seq data (Figure 4B), suggesting that the algorithm per-
forms well on ATAC-seq input data, allowing us to analyze
many TFs besides those with ChIP-seq data. It should be noted
that this method struggles to separate TFs with highly similar
binding motifs (such as most STAT proteins) and may underesti-
mate the activity of TFs with degenerate motifs. In our interpreta-
tion, we associate motifs with the most likely target gene
based on the literature, hit score, and expression level in our
RNA-seq data.
To obtain an overview of the role of all TFs, we categorized TFs
according to their activity over time within the Th2 differentiation
pathway and whether their activity differs between Th2 and Th0
cells. In other words, two distinct comparisons are made: first
t = 0 h versus t = 72 h within the Th0 compartment, which we
term ‘‘activation,’’ and second, Th0 versus Th2 cells at t = 72
h, which we term ‘‘differentiation.’’ Figure 4C illustrates this anal-
ysis by showing MARA activity scores independently calculated
for Th2 and Th0 cells for a number of selected TFs. An example of
a TF strongly associated with differentiation (i.e., large difference
between black and green lines) is Fos/Irf4,Xbp1, while an activa-
tion phenotype, reflected in a large difference between t = 0 h
and t = 72 h, is observed for E2f1/Irf4.
The majority of TFs display a behavior reflecting both activa-
tion and differentiation (Figure 4D). We note that for many TFs
the activity score does not reflect an increase in expression.
Indeed, this is a key strength of the MARA analysis, which

 calculates a score based on the activity of downstream target
genes and can therefore reflect post-transcriptional regu-
lation or protein-protein interactions affecting TF activity (in-
dividual genes in Figure 4C, comparison to differential expres-
sion in Figure 4E). An example of this is the Th2-defining TF
Gata3/Gata3!,Xbp1!, which shows a transient increase in activity,
yet its expression levels continually increase with time. Gata3 is
one of the strongest mediators of both activation and differen-
tiation, although its differentiation activity appears to be ex-
erted early. Stat6/Gata3! is also thought to act early in differen-
tiation, after its activation via the Il4 receptor Il4ra/Gata3. We
previously showed that, during Th2 differentiation, signals
from IL4R are predominantly transduced through STAT6 (Elo
et al., 2010). Consistent with those findings, our data suggest
that Stat6 activity continues to increase throughout differentia-
tion. Interestingly all the STAT proteins map closely together in
Figure Dd (gray circle), affecting primarily differentiation but
also activation, possibly all contributing to different extents de-
pending on their expression, phosphorylation status, and inter-
actions with other proteins and regulatory elements. Irf4 is also
in this cluster (Figure 4D). Foxo1/Il13,Xbp1 and Xbp1/Il4 are also
strongly connected to activation and differentiation but with
Foxo1 and Xbp1 having effects in the opposite direction. Previ-
ous work suggested that the primary role of Batf is to open the
chromatin together with Irf4 (Ciofani et al., 2012), and this is
consistent with our analysis in Figure 3F. Here, Batf is one of
the strongest differentiators, suggesting that chromatin open-
ing is restricted to sites required for differentiation.
The roles of other genes are less clear. TFs that were identi-
fied as hits include Atf4/Il4! (Xia et al., 2015) and Yy2/Gata3,
Id4/Il13,(Il4),Xbp1, Ebf1/Irf4, Foxp2/Gata3, Yy1/Il4,Il13,Xbp1,Gata3,
and Fli1/Il4! affecting both activation and differentiation but
with weaker effects. The identification of a cluster of E2F-
proteins as strongly and purely activation-related is consistent
with their role in cell-cycle control.
The MARA approach allowed us to extract canonical Th2 TFs,
such as Stat6, Gata3, and Batf, and in addition highlighted TF hits
(E2f1, Foxo1) that are also likely to be relevant for Th2 develop-
ment. Similar results hold also when applied to the human time
course data (Figure S4). Since MARA is not directly dependent
on TF target gene co-variation, the output is complementary to
the previous DE approach. This analysis reinforces the notion
that many TFs are involved in both activation and differentiation,
with Gata3 being a notable example consistent with published
literature.
Validation of Hits by Individual CRISPR KO to Assess
Activation versus Differentiation
Next, we used the results described so far, related these to the
existing literature, and chose a panel of 45 genes (40 by scores
across all the screens and 5 controls), which were then validated
by individual CRISPR KO. Several of the chosen genes have
been studied before though not specifically in T cells. Our selec-
tion of interesting genes for further characterization is by no
means comprehensive, and additional genes can be found by
browsing our online resource.
For each KO, cells were grown under Th2 differentiation con-
ditions, and RNA-seq was carried out on day 4. For each gene, a
DE list of KO versus non-targeting control was derived and
compared to the activation and differentiation axes. As before,
we defined the activation axis as the DE genes from 72 h versus
0 h under Th0 culture condition and the differentiation axis as the
DE genes from Th0 versus Th2 at the 72 h time point (Figure 3A).
It should be noted that some genes might not be consistently
higher or lower in Th2 versus Th0 cells over time. To identify
whether a KO aligns with one of these axes, we determined
the projection of the DE genes of the particular KO to the afore-
mentioned axes (Figure 5A; see STAR Methods for further de-
tails). Figure 5B shows that all genes tested map away from
the neutral center of the plot (shaded in gray), indicating that
the hits are weighted to contribute slightly more strongly to either
differentiation or activation. In the KO analysis, Il4 shows little
effect, which we believe is due to IL4 being supplemented in
the media.
Consistent with the MARA analysis, Stat6 is primarily driving
differentiation. By basing this analysis just on expression,
Gata3 now appears to be primarily driving activation, while in
MARA it is also controlling differentiation. For TFs, the MARA
analysis uses only the expression values of genes that are bound
by the relevant TF and is therefore likely to be more accurate
whenever the two analyses diverge.
The majority of KO genes affect both differentiation and
activation to some degree. Examples of interesting genes that
have not been studied extensively before in T cells are Pgk1/Il4,
Lrrc40/Gata3, Slc25a3/Irf4, and Ccdc134/Il4!,Irf4!.
Important Transcription Factors Revealed through
Overexpression and ChIP-Seq Validation
To further validate the function and gain mechanistic insights
for some of the genes identified in the screen, we performed
overexpression by cloning the coding sequence of Bhlhe40,
Pparg,
Ccdc134,
Gata3,
Lrrc40,
and
Scara3
into
the
MSCV-gene-IRES-BFP (murine stem cell virus-gene-internal
ribosome entry site-blue fluorescent protein) vector. We per-
formed individual transduction and RNA-seq; individual DE
genes are listed in the Data S2. To summarize the data and
allow comparison to the knockout experiments, we repeated
the activation-differentiation analysis (Figure 5C). Since over-
expression is approximately the opposite of KO, the sign of
the axis in this panel has been reversed for easy compara-
bility. Qualitatively, we find agreement between KO and
overexpression.
The previously unpublished Lrrc40/Gata3 is in particularly
good agreement with the KO analysis. We found that it upregu-
lates Il4 (p = 2 3 10�17) and Il5 (p = 2 3 10�11), supporting its role
in differentiation. It also regulates Igfbp4/Gata3 (p = 7 3 10�17).
Overexpression of Igfbp4 has been shown to inhibit the
growth of the thymus (Zhou et al., 2004), which is the same
phenotype as observed in Gata3 KO mice, suggesting a link
Lrrc40/Igfbp4/Gata3. The molecular function of Lrrc40 is un-
known. It is present in all cell types and is expressed at the same
level across CD4 T cell types. The presence of leucine-rich re-
peats (LRR), shared with the Toll-like receptor, points to a func-
tion in the innate immune system/Irf4 (Sun et al., 2018). Based on
literature, Lrrc40 may regulate cell volume (Kasuya et al., 2018)
or Ca2+ channels (Yang et al., 2017).
Cell 176, 882–896, February 7, 2019
889
 While overexpression experiments validated our hits, we
wished to gain further insight into the mechanisms by which
some of the validated genes function. To this end, we added
3xFLAG tag at the 50 end of the two TFs, Bhlhe40 and Pparg,
to allow us to find their direct targets by ChIP-seq using a
FLAG antibody. Using this method, we analyzed the genome-
wide binding events of Bhlhe40 as well as Pparg/Il13,Gata3. For
both Bhlhe40 and Pparg, we found the expected motifs to be
highly enriched (Figures 5D and 5E). Under the PPARG peaks,
we found a strong enrichment of several other motifs (listed in
Figure 5E; full list in Figure S5), including AP1, ETS1, RUNX1,
IRF:BATF, GATA3, and STAT5.
The identification of motifs for known T cell program-related
genes prompted us to extend our analysis. We compared the
3xFLAG
ChIP-seq
to
our
endogenous
GATA3/IRF4/BATF
ChIP-seq, and all the previously published relevant T cell ChIP-
seq datasets (TFs and other DNA-binding proteins, see STAR
Methods). When clustering the TFs based on their ChIP target

Figure 5. KO and Overexpression Effect on Activation and Differentiation for Key Hits
(A) Axes representing activation and differentiation were defined in an unbiased way as the fold changes of DE genes from the RNA-seq time course, with
activation as Th0 (t = 0) versus Th0 (t = 72 h) and differentiation as Th2 versus Th0 (t = 72 h).
(B) The effect of gene KOs were quantified as the DE genes between KO and WT. These DE genes were then projected onto the axes representing activation and
differentiation. Thus genes/KOs toward the middle of the plot have the least effect.
(C) Verification of the KO effect by overexpression. The same projection onto the activation and differentiation axes. To facilitate comparison, the axes have been
flipped, thus genes should appear in the same position as in the KO analysis. There is a qualitative agreement between KO and OE.

 genes (Figure 5F), GATA3, PPARG, BARF, and IRF4 appear in
one cluster, and this holds true for a range of comparison
methods (e.g., Pearson correlation, Jaccard index, among
others, with and without normalizing for the number of peaks,
data not shown). This may explain why Pparg is one of the
most significant hits in our CRISPR screen: After Stat6 and
Gata3, it has the highest Gata3 upstream screen score of all
TFs. Xbp1 and Bhlhe40 cluster near Gata3. The close relation-
ship of Bhlhe40 and Pparg with canonical Th2 regulators identi-
fied these two TFs as members of the core Th2 regulatory
network.
Interestingly, STAT6 is separated from the GATA3 cluster. To
understand why, we looked closer at how the main Th2 TFs con-
nect together. A graph of TF connectivity is shown in Figure 6A,
where ChIP peaks were associated with their closest genes
whenever their distance to the TSS was less than 20 kb. Other
metrics gave a similar result (data not shown). As in Figure 5F,
PPARG-IRF4-BATF-GATA3 form a very tight cluster of TFs that
regulate each other and share target genes. STAT6, which con-
trols the Th2 program after input from IL4R, feeds into this pro-
gram but also directly regulates the downstream cytokines.
BHLHE40 and XBP1 are connected but mainly reside down-
stream of the other core TFs. A complementary network,

focusing on some of the most differen-
tially expressed activation marker genes,
is provided in Figure S6.
We next focused on genes with consis-
tent overexpression data and KO data
(i.e., opposite direction in fold change),
which were also identified as ChIP-seq
direct targets (annotated ChIP-seq peaks
are in Data S2). Bhlhe40/Irf4 has been
shown to suppress inflammation through
Il10 (Huynh et al., 2018), which our data
supports (direct target, Figure 6B, DE
p = 0.015). In another model, ChIP-PCR
in iNKT of Bhlhe40 has shown that
BHLHE40 binds near the Ifng locus and
that binding is facilitated by
Tbx21
(Kanda et al., 2016). However, we do
not see any peak near Ifng in Th2,
despite overexpression, nor does DE
analysis suggest any effect. Our data
suggest alternative mechanisms. For
example, Tnfrsf13b/Il13,Irf4 and Tnfsf13b
are both DE, in opposite directions, with Tnfrsf13b a direct target.
A peak and weak downregulation (p = 0.015), however, supports
Bhlhe40 as a negative regulator of inflammation through Il10
(Yu et al., 2018).
Pparg/Il13,Gata3 has recently been shown to be essential for
Th2 development (Chen et al., 2017), which our screen confirms.
Il5 (p = 10�14), Il4 (p = 2 3 10�6) are highly DE direct targets (Fig-
ure 6b). This fits with previous experiments as PPAR family
members have been noted to influence T cell activation and dif-
ferentiation (Choi and Bothwell 2012).
To conclude, we have investigated several genes individually
by overexpression and mapped their impact on activation and
differentiation. We show that two upstream TFs, Bhlhe40 and
Pparg, functionally overlap with the central Th2 genes GATA3,
BATF, and IRF4.
Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, the applicability
of CRISPR to primary murine T cells. By carrying out in vitro
genome-wide screens, we have created a resource of genes
important for Th2 helper cell differentiation. We provide opti-
mized protocols for performing additional screens as well as in-
dividual KOs. In our analysis, we chose five different readouts
Cell 176, 882–896, February 7, 2019
891
 (Gata3, Il4, Il13, Xbp1, and Irf4), which represent Th2 differentia-
tion and/or activation.
Our unbiased approach to discover Th2 regulators show that
the identified hits belong to many different classes of proteins,
including cytokines, TFs, proteins involved in calcium signaling,
and metabolic genes. We performed regulatory network analysis
(MARA) to obtain deeper insights into the upstream genes and
observed that many regulatory genes are involved in both differ-
entiation and activation. A summary of this analysis and our vali-
dation experiments is shown in Figure 7.
Our analysis of Th2 differentiation has allowed us to add to the
list of known regulators, such as Gata3 or Stat6, a number of
poorly or not previously examined genes. Among TFs, examples
include
Foxo1/Il13,Xbp1,
Bcl11b/Il13!,
Pparg/Il13,Gata3,
and
Bhlhe40/Irf4 (Figure 6B). Non-TFs have also been highlighted,
including the cytokine Ccdc134/Il4!,Irf4!,Gata3.
For 45 genes, we also generated specific knockouts and
analyzed overexpression and validated their impact on differen-
tiation and activation through RNA-seq. Bhlhe40/Irf4 and
Pparg/Il13,Gata3 were studied further through ChIP-seq, indi-
cating that Pparg is particularly central to the Th2 program.
Our results yield further insights into genes involved in T helper
cell differentiation that deserve further analysis. We also provide
an efficient protocol for CRISPR-mediated KO. Both of these re-
sources are key tools that will enable a more complete under-
standing of T helper cell biology. By combining our CRISPR
KO screen with time course data, ChIP-seq, and overexpres-
sion, we have been able to provide a comprehensive map of
the most important genes for Th2 differentiation and activation.
These genes, along with their expression dynamics and chro-
matin accessibility, can be browsed on our supplemental web-
site, http://www.teichlab.org/data/.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Generation of mouse strains
Rosa26Cas9/+ mice (Tzelepis et al., 2016) were crossed with other mice carrying fluorescent reporters. These strains were Gata3GFP
(Grote et al., 2006), Il13+/Tom (Barlow et al., 2012) and Il4tm1.1Wep (Hu-Li et al., 2001). For the screens we pooled mice, both hetero-
zygous and homozygous for Cas9 expression, male and female, of 8-12 weeks age.
The GATA3-3xFLAG-mCherry mouse strain was produced briefly as follows. The targeting construct was generated by BAC liquid
recombineering (Skarnes et al., 2011) such that a CTAP TAG element was linked via a Picornavirus ‘‘self-cleaving’’ T2a peptide (Parks
et al., 1986) to mCherry red fluorescent protein and placed upstream of a LoxP/Frt flanked promoter driven Neomycin cassette
(CTAP-T2a-mCherry-Neomycin). The cassette was flanked by arms of homology and designed to fuse the tagged fluorescent
cassette to the terminal Gata3 coding exon, replacing the stop coding and a portion of the endogenous 30UTR (Figure S3). Two
sgRNA oligos, gata3_flag_* (See Supplemental data S8 for sequences), were designed to generate double-strand breaks 30 to the
terminal stop codon. The respective complementary oligos (Sigma Genosys) were annealed and cloned into a U6 expression vector.
The targeting construct (2ug), along each U6 guide (1.5*2ug) and wild-type Cas9 (3ug, kind gift from George Church) were
nucleofected into 3*107 JM8 F6 C57BL/6 ES cells using Amaxa Human Stem Cell Kit 2 (Lonza #VPH-5022) and the Amaxa nucleo-
fector B. Subsequent ES cell injections and animal husbandry were carried out by the Sanger Animal facility.
Use of mice in experiments
The mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus Research Support
Facility (Cambridge, UK). These animal facilities are approved by and registered with the UK Home Office. All procedures were in
accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The protocols were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical
Review Body of the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus.
For the screens we used different Cas9-expressing strains as denoted throughout the text. We pooled mice of mixed gender,
heterozygous and homozygous expression of Cas9. The mice were 8-12 weeks old, healthy, and had not been used for other exper-
iments. Between 15 and 30 mice were pooled in each replicate. Of these, some of the mice had shared cage, and mouse selection
was guided by convenience and availability.
For the the time course ATAC-seq and RNA-seq experiments we used wild-type C57BL/6Jax mice, mixed gender 8-12 weeks old.
Similar cohorts of homo/hetero Cas9 mice were used for the follow up individual CRISPR KO experiments. For the ChIP-seq and
overexpression we used CBLA mice.
Human model
Umbilical cord blood was obtained from healthy neonates, mixed genders, at Turku University Central Hospital. The usage of the cord
blood of unknown donors was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital District of Southwest Finland (24.11.1998 article 323)
and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

 Cell lines for virus production
293T-cells (ATCC) were maintained in Advanced DMEM/F12 (GIBCO #12491015) supplemented with geneticin (500ug/mL, GIBCO
#10131035) at 37C. The cells were split between every 3 to 5 days, 80%+ confluency except during transfections. The cell lines were
not authenticated.
METHOD DETAILS
Cloning
The software Collagene (http://www.collagene.org/) was used to design and support the cloning. Phusion polymerase (NEB
#M0531L) was used for all cloning PCR reactions.
The entire BFP/puromycin and sgRNA system was PCR-amplified from pKLV-U6sgRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP (primers:
kosuke_mfei_fwd/kosuke_clai_rev). The plasmid pMSCV-IRES-mCherry FP (Addgene #52114) grown in dam-/dcm- competent
E. coli (NEB #C2925I), was digested with NEB ClaI/MfeI and the backbone was gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
(QIAGEN #28704). Ligation was done with T4 ligase (NEB #M0202T). The resulting plasmid that can be used to target individual genes
was named pMSCV-U6sgRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP (Addgene #102796).
To produce the pooled library pMSCV-U6gRNA(lib)-PGKpuroT2ABFP (Addgene: #104861) the sgRNA part of a previous mouse
KO sgRNA pooled library (Tzelepis et al., 2016) (Addgene: #67988) was PCR-amplified using the primers gib_sgRNAlib_fwd/rev.
Up to 1ug was loaded in a reaction and run for 10 cycles. The insert was gel purified, and then repurified/concentrated using the
MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN #28006). The backbone from pMSCV-U6sgRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP was obtained by
BamHI-HF (NEB) digestion. The final product was produced by Gibson assembly (NEB #E2611S) and combining the output of 10
reactions. 6 tubes of 5-alpha Electrocompetent E. coli (NEB #C2989K) were transformed using electroporation and the final
library obtained by combining 4 maxipreps. The library complexity was confirmed by streaking diluted bacteria onto plates and
counting colonies. The total number of colonies was > 100x the size of the library which according to simulations in R is far beyond
the requirement for faithful replication of a library (data not shown).
Two Cas9 control viruses were also derived from pKLV2(W-)U6sgRNA5(BbsI)-PGKpuroBFP and pKLV2(gfp)U6sgRNA5(BbsI)-
PGKpuroBFP. The resulting plasmids are correspondingly named pMSCV(W-)U6sgRNA5(BbsI)-PGKpuroBFP and pMSCV(gfp)
U6sgRNA5(BbsI)-PGKpuroBFP (Addgene #102797, #102798). The cloning was performed in the same manner as for pMSCV-
U6sgRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP.
Virus production
At least one day before transfection, 293T cells were kept in media without geneticin. When at roughly 80% confluency (day 1), the
cells were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX. To a 10cm dish with 5ml advanced DMEM, we added 3ml OPTI-MEM (GIBCO
#31985062) containing 36ul LTX, 15ul PLUS (Thermofisher #15338030), and a total of 7.5ug library plasmid and 7.5ug pcl-Eco
plasmid (Naviaux et al., 1996) (Addgene #12371). The OPTI-MEM was incubated for 30 min prior to addition. The media was replaced
with 5ml fresh Advanced DMEM/F12 the day after transfection (day 2), and virus harvested on day 3. Cells were removed by filtering
through a 0.45um syringe filter. Virus was either snap frozen or stored in 4�C (never longer than day 5 before being used).
Validation of Cas9 cutting in mouse
Expression of Cas9 was confirmed by western blot (anti-Cas9, BioLegend 7A9, #844301) as well as by RT-PCR (primers:
cas9_qpcr1/2/r/f). Qualitatively, Cas9 expression appears to increase during activation of cells (data not included). The function of
Cas9 was also validated using the two control viruses and cytometric analysis. The resulting viruses express both GFP and BFP
but only one of them contains a sgRNA targeting its own GFP sequence FACS analysis confirmed a reduction in GFP signal in
T cells infected with the self-targeting virus, as compared to T cells infected with the control virus (data not included).
T cell extraction for CRISPR screening
6-well plates were first prepared at least 2 hours before by adding anti-CD3e (1ul/mL, eBioscience #16-0031-81) in PBS, at least
1.2ml/well, and then kept at 37�C.
Cells were extracted from spleens by the following procedure: Spleens were massaged through a 70um strainer into cold IMDM
media (strainer slanted to avoid crushing the cells). Cells were spun down at 5min/400 g and then resuspended in 5ml red blood
cell lysis media (3-4 spleens per 50ml falcon tube). After 4 min PBS was added up to 50ml and cells spun again. Cells were then
resuspended in cold PBS and taken through a 70um strainer. The cells were counted and spun down again. Finally, the cells
were negatively selected using EasySep Mouse Naive CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Stem Cell Technologies, #19765) except for the
following modifications: The volume and amount of antibodies were scaled down to 20% of that specified by the manufacturer.
Up to the equivalent of the cells of 6-7 spleens can be loaded on one ‘‘The Big Easy’’ EasySep Magnet (Stem Cell Technologies,
#18001). Overloading it will cause a severe drop in output cells.
On day 0, the cells were then resuspended in warm IMDM supplemented with 2-Mercaptoethanol ‘‘BME’’ (50 uM GIBCO
#31350010), IL4 (10ng/mL, R&D Systems 404-ML), IL2 (6ng/mL) and anti-CD28 (3ug/mL, eBioscience #16-0281-86) and Pen/Strep,
before being seeded onto the 6-well plates (30-40M cells per plate).

 T cell culturing for CRISPR screening
On day 1, the cells were infected by the following procedure. To each well, 1.2ml media was added. This media consisted of 80%
virus, 20% IMDM, supplemented with BME/IL2/IL4/anti-CD28 at concentrations as before. In addition, the media contained 8ug/mL
polybrene. The plate was put in a zip-lock lag and spun at 1100 g for about 2 hours at 32�C. The plate was then put in an incubator
overnight (never more than 24h in total). The cells in the media were spun down (the cells attached kept in place) and resuspended
with media as after the T cell extraction except with the addition of 2ug/mL puromycin. Each well required 3-4ml media. For the 7 day
culturing the media had to be replenished after half the day. We estimate that the MOI was about 0.2. The use of puromycin is
essential to keep the FACS time down to reasonable levels (commonly 2ng/mL).
Sorting and genomic DNA extraction
On the day of sorting, cells were extracted and spun down. To eliminate dead cells we performed a ‘‘low-g spin,’’ 5 min at 200 g. This
brought the viability up to roughly 50%. We have in addition tried other methods such as Ficoll (works slightly better but takes 30 min
and is harder to reproduce) and Miltenyi Dead Cell Removal Kit. In our experience, the Miltenyi kit works great on uninfected cells but
effectively removed almost every infected cell when attempted on the real sample. This is most likely because the kit does negative
selection against Annexins which might be promoted by the virus or the puromycin.
In the cases when we used antibody reporters, we first fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3 Transcription Factor Staining
Buffer Kit (eBioscience, #00-5523-00). We then used the following antibodies: PE Mouse anti-XBP-1S (BD Biosciences,
#562642), FITC anti-IRF4 (BD Biosciences, #11-9858-80) and Alexa Fluor 488 Mouse anti-GATA3 (BD Biosciences, #560077).
For sorting, cells were resuspended at 40M/mL in IMDM with BME and 3mM EDTA (PBS for the stained cells). The use of EDTA is
essential to ensure singlet events at this high cell concentrations. The cells were then sorted into IMDM using either a Beckman MoFlo
or MoFlo XDP, or BD Influx. For non-stained screens we could use BFP to ensure that the cells passed were infected. For the stained
screens the BFP signal was disrupted by the staining and we performed it blindly. The subsequent steps are not affected by the
addition of uninfected cells. During protocol development, the FACS data was analyzed using the software FACSanadu (Bu
¨ rglin
and Henriksson 2017) (http://www.facsanadu.net).
After sorting the cells, we performed DNA extraction in two different ways. When using fluorescent reporter strains we used the
Blood & Cell Culture DNA Midi Kit (QIAGEN #13343). For the fixed cells, due to lack of suitable commercial kits (The FFPE kits we
have seen are for low amounts of DNA only), we instead performed DNA extraction as follows. Sorted cells were pellet using a
table-top centrifuge at 2000 g, 5 min. Cell pellet was resuspended in 500 ul Lysis Buffer I (50 mM HEPES.KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100) and rotate at 4�C for 10 min. Cells were spun down at
2000 g, 5 min, resuspended in 500 ul Lysis Buffer II (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA) and rotate
at 4�C for 10 min. Then the cells were pelleted again at 2000 g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ul Lysis Buffer
III (Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine). Then 75 ul TES
Buffer (50 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) was added to the cell suspension. This 100 ul reaction was put on an Eppendorf
ThermoMixer C to reverse crosslinking at 65�C, overnight. Then 1 ul proteinase K (20 mg/mL, ThermoFisher #100005393) was added,
and protein was digested at 55�C for 1 hour. DNA was purified using MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, #28006) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. DNA concentration was measured by a Nanodrop.
Sequencing of CRISPR virus insert
The genomic DNA was first PCR-amplified (primers: gLibrary-HiSeq_50bp-SE_u1/l1 (Tzelepis et al., 2016)) in a reaction with Q5 Hot
Start High-Fidelity 2 3 Master Mix (NEB #M0494L). In each 50ul reaction, we loaded up to 3ug DNA. From each reaction we pipetted
and pooled 5ul, before purifying it using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN #28104). The purified product was then further
PCR-amplified using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems #KK2602) and iPCRtag sequencing adapters (Quail et al.,
2014)þ. After Ampure XP bead purification (beads made up 70% of the solution) and Bioanalyzer QC, the libraries were pooled
and sequenced with a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina #SY-401-2501, 19bp SE). The custom primers U6-Illumina-seq2 (R1) and iPCRtagseq
(index sequencing) were used for this purpose. The original sgRNA library contained 86,035 distinct sgRNAs. In a representative
sequencing run (Gata3, using antibody selection) the sgRNAs with fewer than 500 reads encompassing 91% of the total complexity.
Mouse time-course RNA-seq
CD4+CD62L+ naive T cells were purified from spleens of wild-type C57BL/6JAX adult (6 - 8 weeks) mice using the CD4+CD62L+
T Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi #130-093-227). Cell culture plates were coated with anti-CD3e antibody (1 ug/mL, eBioscience #16-
0031-81) in 1X DPBS (GIBCO) at 4�C overnight. Purified naive T cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 M cells/mL on the coated
plates in IMDM (GIBCO) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma #F9665-500ML), supplied with 5 ug/mL anti-CD28 (eBioscience
#16-0281-86) with (Th2) or without (Th0) 10 ng/mL mouse recombinant IL-4 (R&D Systems #404-ML-050). Cells were cultured in
plates for up to 72 hours.
Total RNA was purified from all the cultured cells by QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s instruction, and con-
centration was determined by a Nanodrop. A total of 500 ng RNA was used to prepare sequencing libraries using KAPA Stranded
mRNA-seq Kit (KAPA #07962193001) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq
2000 (125bp PE, v4 chemistry).

 The efficiency of the Th2 differentiation was confirmed by antibody staining and FACS (Figure S5). In vitro differentiated Th2 cells
were fixed, permeabilized and stained with fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies to detect intracellular cytokine expression
following eBioscience intracellular staining protocol as previously described (Pramanik et al., 2018) (also described in http://
tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/staining-intracellular-antigens-for-flow-cytometry.pdf).
Fluorescent
dye-conju-
gated primary antibodies used: IL4 (eBioscience clone #11B11), IL13 (eBioscience clone #eBio13A) and CD4 (eBioscience clone
#GK1.5 or #RM4-5). Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a Fortessa (BD Biosciences) using FACSDiva and FlowJo
software. CompBeads (BD Biosciences) were used for compensation where distinct positively stained populations were
unavailable.
Human time-course RNA-seq
Mononuclear cells were isolated from the cord blood of healthy neonates at Turku University Central Hospital using Ficoll-Paque
PLUS (GE Healthcare, #17-1440-02). CD4+ T cells were then isolated using the Dynal CD4+ isolation kit (Invitrogen, #11331D).
CD4+ cells from three individual donors were activated directly in 24w plates with plate-bound anti-CD3 (500ng/well, Beckman
Coulter, #IM1304) and soluble anti-CD28 (500 ng/mL, #Beckman Coulter, #IM1376) at a density of 2 3 106 cells/mL of Yssel’s
medium (Yssel et al., 1984) containing 1% human AB serum (PAA). Th2 cell polarization was initiated with IL-4 (10 ng/mL, R&D
Systems, #204-IL-050). Cells activated without IL-4 were also cultured (Th0). At 48 hr, IL-2 was added to the cultures (17 ng/mL,
R&D Systems, #202-IL-500). All the cells were harvested at respective time points and RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN #74106) for library preparation. The efficiency of the Th2 differentiation was confirmed by measuring GATA3 levels using
western blot (WB) and RT-qPCR.
For WB, cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (TXLB) (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5%
Glycerol, 1% SDS) and sonicated for 5 min using a Bioruptor sonicator. Protein concentration was then estimated using DC Protein
assay (Biorad #500-0111). Equal protein amounts were loaded onto acrylamide gel (Bio-Rad Mini or Midi PROTEAN TGX precast
gels). For protein transfer to PVDF membranes, mini or a midi transfer packs from Bio-Rad were used, depending on the gel
size. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed in 5% Non-Fat milk or BSA in TBST buffer (0.1%Tween 20 in
Tris-buffered saline). The following antibodies were used: GATA3 (BD PharMingen #558686); GAPDH (Hytest #5G4MAB6C5); Actin
(Sigma, #A5441).
For RT-qPCR, RNA was isolated (RNeasy Mini Kit, #74106, QIAGEN) and treated in-column with DNase (RNase-Free Dnase Set,
#79254, QIAGEN) for 15 min. The removal of genomic DNA was ascertained by treating the samples with DNase I (Invitrogen, #18068-
015) before cDNA synthesis with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, #18064014). RT-qPCR was performed (primers:
rtqpcr_hGata3_*). KAPA Probe Fast Rox Low master mix (KAPA Biosystems, #kk4718) was used and amplification was monitored
with QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific).The Ct values were normalized against the signal
acquired with EF1a (primers: rtqpcr_hEF1a_*).
ATAC-seq was performed from same cultures for better comparability. ATAC-seq libraries were prepared as described below.
TIME-COURSE ATAC-SEQ DATA GENERATION
Experiments were done according to the published protocol (Buenrostro et al., 2013)þ with some modification. Briefly, 50,000 cells
were washed with ice cold 1X DPBS twice, and resuspended in a sucrose swelling buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 7.5,
3 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol). The cell suspension was left on ice for 10 min. Then, a final concentration of 0.5%
NP-40 was added, and the cells suspension was vortexed for 10 s and left on ice for 10 min. Nuclei was pelleted at 500 g at 4�C
for 10 min. Nuclei were washed once with 1X TD buffer (from Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit, Illumina, #FC-121-1030), and
resuspended in 50 ul tagmentation mix containing:
d 25 ul 2X TD buffer (Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit, Illumina #FC-121-1030)
d 22.5 ul H2O
d 2.5 ul TDE1 (Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit, Illumina #FC-121-1030)
The tagmentation reaction was carried out on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C at 37�C, 800 rpm, for 30 min. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 250 ul (5 volumes) Buffer PB (from QIAGEN MinElute PCR Purification Kit), The tagmented DNA was
purified by QIAGEN PCR Purification Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 12.5 ul Buffer EB from the kit, which
yielded �10 ul purified DNA.
The library amplification was done in a 25 ul reaction include:

 PCR was performed as follows:
d 72�C 5 min
d 98�C 2 min
d [98�C 10 s, 63�C 30 s, 72�C 60 s] x 12
d 10�C hold
Amplified libraries were purified by double Agencourt AMPureXP beads purifications (Beckman Coulter, #A63882).
0.4X beads:DNA ratio for the first time, flow through was kept (removing large fragments); 1.4X beads:DNA ratio for the
second time, beads were kept. Libraries were eluted from the beads by elution in 20 ul Buffer EB (from QIAGEN PCR Purifica-
tion Kit).
1 ul library was run on a Agilent Bioanalyzer to check size distribution and quality of the libraries.
Sequencing was done with an Illumina Hiseq 2500 (75 bp PE).
ChIP-seq data generation
ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al., 2015)þ was used to investigate the TF binding sites. 1 million cells from each sample were crosslinked
in 1% HCHO (prepared in 1X DPBS) at room temperature for 10 min, and HCHO was quenched by the addition of glycine at a final
concentration of 0.125 M. Cells were pelleted at 4�C at 2000 x g, washed with ice-cold 1X DPBS twice, and snapped frozen in liquid
nitrogen. The cell pellets were stored in �80�C until the experiments were performed. ChIPmentation was performed according to the
version 1.0 of the published protocol (http://www.medical-epigenomics.org/papers/schmidl2015/) with some modifications at the
ChIP stage. The antibody used were IRF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-6059), BATF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-100974)
and FLAG (Sigma M2, #F3165).
Briefly, cell pellets were thawed on ice, and lysed in 300 ul ChIP Lysis Buffer I (50 mM HEPES.KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% Glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100) on ice for 10 min. Then cells were pelleted at 4�C at 2000 x g for 5 min,
and washed by 300 ul ChIP Lysis Buffer II (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 8.0), and
pelleted again at 4�C at 2000 x g for 5 min. Nuclei were resuspended in 300 ul ChIP Lysis Buffer III (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-Lauroylsarcosine). Chromatin was sonicated using Bioruptor
Pico (Diagenode) with 30 s ON/30 s OFF for 10 cycles. 30 ul 10% Triton X-100 was added into each sonicated chromatin,
and insoluble chromatin was pelleted at 16,100 x g at 4�C for 10 min. 1 ul supernatant was taken as input control. The rest of the
supernatant was incubated with 10 ul Protein A or G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher #10001D, 10003D) pre-bound with 1 ug anti-
FLAG in a rotating platform in a cold room overnight. Each immunoprecipitation (IP) was washed with 500 ul RIPA Buffer (50 mM
HEPES.KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.7% Sodium Deoxycholate, check components) for 3 times. Then,
each IP was washed with 500 ul 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 twice, and resuspended in 30 ul tagmentation reaction mix (10 mM Tris.Cl,
pH 8.0, 5 mM Mg2Cl, 1 ul TDE1 (Nextera). Then, the tagmentation reaction was put on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C at 37�C for
10 min at 800 rpm shaking. After the tagmentation reaction, each IP was washed sequentially with 500 ul RIPA Buffer twice, and
1X TE NaCl (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl) once. Elution and reverse-crosslinking were done by
resuspending the beads with 100 ul ChIP Elution Buffer (50 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS) on an Eppendorf
ThermoMixer C at 65�C overnight, 1,400 rpm. DNA was purified by MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, #28004) and eluted
in 12.5 ul Buffer EB (QIAGEN kit, #28004), which yielded �10 ul ChIPed DNA.
The library preparation reactions contained the following:
d 10 ul purified DNA (from above)
d 2.5 ul PCR Primer Cocktails (Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit, Illumina #FC-121-1030)
d 2.5 ul N5xx (Nextera Index Kit, Illumina #FC-121-1012)
d 2.5 ul N7xx (Nextera index kit, Illumina #FC-121-1012)
d 7.5 ul NPM PCR Master Mix (Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit, Illumina #FC-121-1030)

d 98�C, 2 min
d [98�C, 10 s, 63�C, 30 s, 72�C, 20 s] x 12
d 10�C hold
The amplified libraries were purified by double AmpureXP beads purification: first with 0.5X bead ratio, keep supernatant, second
with 1.4X bead ratio, keep bound DNA. Elution was done in 20 ul Buffer EB (QIAGEN).
1 ul of library was run on an Agilent Bioanalyzer to see the size distribution. Sequencing was done on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 plat-
form (75 bp PE, v4 chemistry).

 Follow-up knock-out RNA-seq data generation
The backbone pMSCV-U6sgRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP was digested using BbsI and purified on a gel. 96*2 desalted oligos for the
sgRNA inserts were obtained from Sigma in premixed and diluted format. They were diluted to 10uM in T4 ligation buffer (NEB,
#M0202T) and annealed (cooling from 98�C to 4�C during 1 hour on a PCR block). Ligations were performed in 10ul volume, in
a 96w PCR on ice. Transformed E. coli (Stbl3, made competent in lab) were streaked onto 10cm ampicillin agar plates using an
8 channel pipette.
To avoid validating individual colonies, a mixture of at minimum 10+ colonies were picked and mixed for each clone. Digest by BbsI
of a few representative shows at the minimum presence of clones without original bbsI spacer. Bacteria were grown overnight in a
96w deep-well plate having an air-permeable seal. Minipreps were made using a homemade gravity manifold holding miniprep tubes
(blueprint for laser cutting available on request). The virus was subsequently made in 293T-cells, in 24w format. The virus was then
harvested into a 96w deep-well plate and any 293T removed by centrifugation.
Naive T cells were extracted from 3 mice independently, this time with the Naive CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi #130-104-453)
according to manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were seeded at 200k/well density in 96w format. Infection and puromycin selection
was then performed as before. On day 5, cells were washed and dead cells removed by low-G spin. This typically raised the viability
from roughly 10%–20% to 60% according to Trypan blue. Cells were spun down and as much of the media removed as possible. Up
to 100ul of buffer RLT+ was then added to each well and plates frozen. Later, plates were thawed and RNA extracted by adding 100ul
of Ampure XP beads. Purification was done by a robot, with 2x200ul EtOH wash and final suspension in RNase-free water. RNA was
then diluted to 500ng/ul and 2ul was taken as input into non-capping DOG-seq (manuscript in preparation). This protocol is for this
application roughly equivalent to Smartseq-2 (Picelli et al., 2014). Libraries were made using Nextera XT (Illumina, #FC-131-1096) and
all 96*3 libraries sequenced with a HiSeq 2500 (150bp PE).
Follow-up overexpression RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data generation
The plasmid pMSCV-IRES-Blue FP (Addgene #52115, gift from Dario Vignali) was digested with NEB MfeI-HF and BamHI-HF and
purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit.
The cDNA for cloning was generated by RLT lysis of in vitro Th2 cells (naive and day 5), Ampure XP bead purification, and
SmartSeq2 first strand synthesis without the addition of the TSO.
For each gene, PCR primers were generated using an R script. The CDS of each gene was downloaded from Ensembl, and
the most DE transcript as given by our RNA-seq time course was selected. Genes that later proved hard to clone from cDNA
were ordered as gBlocks, with optional codon optimization using the IDTDNA web interface.
The first (genefwd) and last 30bp (generev) were used as gene-specific PCR primer part. We created the primers by concatenating
sequences as follows, where RC denotes reverse complement: primer_fwd = (overlapFWD, seqkozak, genefwd), primer_3xflag_fwd =
(seq3xflag, flagspacer, genefwd) and primer_rev = (overlapREV, rc(seqStop), generev). Further, to genes not starting with the codon
G after ATG, the sequence GAG was added. All primers mentioned here were ordered PAGE purified from IDTDNA. The sequences
were fwd_3x = TCTTACGTAGCTAGCGGATCttaaccatggactacaaagaccatgacggtgattataaagatcatgacatcgattacaaggatg, seq3xflag =
cggtgattataaagatcatgacatcgattacaaggatgacgatgacaag, rev_3x = AATTGATCCCGCTCGAGCCTACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAA
TCGATGTCATGATCTTTATAATCACCG, seqkozak = ttaaccatg, seqStop = tag. The gene specific forward sequences are in the
Supplemental Datas. The specific gene product was first obtained by PCR of the cDNA with Phusion master mix (NEB #M0531L),
gene_fwd and gene_rev primers (25 cycles, 2 min extension, 72C annealing). The result was run on an 1% agarose gel, the band
cut, and purified with Qiaquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN #28704) and Qiaquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN #28104).
To obtain 3xFLAG versions of the insert, a phusion PCR reactions were set up (8 cycles, 65C annealing, 2min extension) over the
previously amplified non-3xFLAG fragments, primers fwd_3x, primer_3xflag_fwd and primer_rev. The gene specific inner primer was
used at 0.5uM concentration as opposed to 10uM for the outer primers. The products were purified by Ampure XP and eluted into
10ul NFW.
The inserts and the MSCV backbone were joined with Gibson assembly master mix (NEB #E2611S) in 10ul reactions. 1ul of the
ligated product was transformed in 25ul NEB DH5a competent cells, according to manufacturer’s specification.
Colonies were picked, amplified in 5ml LB (50ml Falcon tube) and plasmid purified by miniprep. Validation was done by two
rounds of Sanger sequencing, forward (mscv_seq2,CTTGAACCTCCTCGTTCGAC) and reverse (mscv_seq3,TAACATATAGAC
AAACGCACACCG). A custom Java program was written to find the best matching expected sequence (generated by previous
R script) and output a FASTA file with the reference and reads (reverse read reverse-complemented). The sequences for each
clone were aligned by CLUSTALW (Chenna et al., 2003). The result was visualized with CLUSTALX and/or a plain text editor.
The sanger sequencing reads of all clones are available as-is on GitHub. The finally selected clones are available on AddGene
with IDs #117263 - 117267.
Naive T cells from CBLA mice were purified, cultured in vitro with IL4, and transduced as described before. The original pMSCV
backbone was used as a negative control. On day 5, 20k BFP+ cells were FACS sorted, spun down and lysed in RLT. RNA-seq
libraries were generated as described before. The remaining cells were used for ChIPmentation, with the IP performed against
3xFLAG (SIGMA, clone F1804). RNA-seq read and ChIPmentaton reads were processed as before. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq libraries
were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500, 50BP SE.

 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Analysis and QC of CRISPR hits
Sequencing BAM-files were transformed into FASTQ using samtools and bamToFastq. A custom Java program was then used
extract per-sgRNA read counts. From these, per-gene p values were calculated using MAGeCK (Li et al., 2014)þ using the positive
and negative cell fraction from each screen. The hit rankings were then compared using R. To obtain a total per-gene score, we first
calculate the total rank from one screen as r = min(rpos,rneg), using the ranks from the positive and negative enrichments respectively.
Then, to calculate the composite score of two or more screens, we used the geometric mean (r1r2r3...rn)1/n. Follow-up hits were manu-
ally picked as those scoring high between the replicates, with genes of low expression level qualitatively filtered out using ImmGen
(Heng et al., 2008)þ.
The BaIOPSE model was implemented in STAN (Carpenter et al., 2017) using the RStan interface. For the full model implementa-
tion and parameters, with variances rather defined by the exponentials over the priors, we refer to the source code. 12 Markov chains
were run 800 steps and convergence was checked by the r-value. The top 300 hits were used to calculate GO term p-values.
GO terms were obtained in R by GO.db (Carlson 2016) and assessed individually using a Fisher exact test.
ChIP-seq peak analysis
The reads were first trimmed using Trimmomatic 0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014) with settings ILLUMINACLIP:NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10
LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:30. Reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome mm10 by
bowtie2 (Langmead & Salzberg 2012)þ. Peaks were then called using MACS2 (Zhang et al., 2008), merged over time, and annotated
using HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010).
The quality of the peaks was assessed using the two available replicates for each time point. While the trend over time agreed, the
number in each time point did not. For this reason we decided to consider the union of the peaks rather than the common peaks.
The sequences of the detected ChIP-seq peaks were extracted using ‘‘bedtools getfasta’’ (Quinlan & Hall 2010), for 200, 300, 400,
500bp regions around the peaks. These were fed into MEME (Bailey et al., 2009) for additional motif discovery.
To compare genes associated to increasing and non-increasing GATA3 peaks, we calculated the relative peak height at 72h versus
24h. We define the most/least increasing as the peaks with top/bottom 1000 ratios, and then included the genes the peaks are
closest to. GO analysis were performed to compare these groups.
Time-course RNA-seq differential expression
Gene expression from RNA-seq data was quantified in TPM using Salmon v0.6.0 (Patro et al., 2017)þ, with the parameters–fldMax
150000000–fldMean 350–fldSD 250–numBootstraps 100–biasCorrect–allowOrphans–useVBOpt. The cDNA sequences supplied
contain genes from GRCm38 (mouse), GRCh38 (human) and sequences from RepBase, as well as ERCC sequences and an
eGFP sequence.
Differentially expressed (DE) genes were found using the Sleuth R package (Pimentel et al., 2017), using the wasabi R package
(https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/wasabi) to allow it to accept Salmon input data. To strengthen the test of differential dynamics
between Th2 and Th0 culture conditions, instead of testing each time point individually (with few replicates), we separated time
into early (%6h) and late (> 6h). The DE test consisted of a likelihood-ratio test using the sleuth_lrt function, where the full model
contained terms accounting for the culture condition, for the temporal effect (modeled as a spline with 5 degrees of freedom) and
for an interaction of both terms. To capture the Th0/Th2 difference, the reduced model only contained a term accounting for the
time variation, modeled as before. A gene is considered differentially expressed for p value < 0.01.
Human/Mouse Stat6 comparison
Targets of Stat6 and Il4 as defined by time-course microarray and ChIP-seq data were downloaded from a previous study (Elo
et al., 2010).
ATAC-seq motif extraction
ATAC-seq reads were aligned using Bowtie 2 (Langmead & Salzberg 2012)þ with the parameter –X 2000 and the mouse genome
mm10. This was followed by peak calling on each replicate individually using MACS2 (Zhang et al., 2008)þ with the function ‘‘call-
peak’’ and the parameters -B–SPMR–call-summits. The peaks obtained were kept if they overlapped a peak from the other replicate
of the same time point by at least 50%. In these cases, the new peak would equal the combined coordinates of all the overlapping
peaks considering all replicates and time points.
Peaks were classified (annotatePeaks.pl–annStats) as intronic, exonic, upstream or intergenic, according to the gene feature they
intersected. Intersection is scored first considering the number of bases overlapped, and then the closeness in size between the peak
and the feature.
Known motif detection was performed on the peaks’ sequences using FIMO (Grant et al., 2011)þ, and motifs from the JASPAR
2016 database (Bryne et al., 2008)þ considering only those starting in MA or PB. In addition, we supplemented with a more recent
list of C2H2 motifs (Schmitges et al., 2016). To make the analysis more targeted, only motifs from TFs DE between Th2 and Th0 were
considered, and for each of them a single motif was selected, prioritizing the longest ones with the lowest mean entropy.

Cell 176, 882–896.e1–e12, February 7, 2019
 The overlap between human and mouse was calculated using liftOver -minMatch = 0.03 -multiple. Roughly 100 peaks mapped
to multiple sites and were thus ignored. LiftOver was also performed on individual TF sites from FIMO. The overlap between organ-
isms was calculated using R GenomicRanges (Lawrence et al., 2013). The overlap procedure was done at the peak and detected
motif levels.
We found that the analyses throughout the paper appear to give similar results when using all mouse peaks as opposed to only
using the conserved (overlapping) peaks. However, the ChIP-seq peaks of GATA3, IRF4 and BATF appear more comparable to
ATAC-seq predicted sites if only the conserved sites are used are used in the MARA.
ATAC-seq chromatin dynamics analysis
The height of the peaks, as well as any reads outside the peaks, were quantified using bedtools (Quinlan & Hall 2010). The peak levels
were divided by the background signal for normalization. Further, to make the contributions from different peaks comparable, they
were normalized to the level of the second time point. The contribution of motifs over time is defined as the average peak signal in
which they are present.
UCSC visualization of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq
The MACS2-generated BedGraph files were prepared for UCSC visualization using bedSort and bedGraphToBigWig.
MARA analysis
The MARA analysis was performed as follows. Early and late times were analyzed independently. For each of the two durations, the
connectivity matrix was constructed based on if a motif peak was present for a gene at any time. The number of such peaks, ignoring
time fluctuations, were entered as the connectivity value. The full RNA-seq time-course data for either Th0 or Th2 was used as the
signal. These two files were uploaded to ISMARA (Balwierz et al., 2014) using expert mode.
In the MARA comparison over time, Th0 and Th2 difference is calculated as the average MARA activity difference over time. The
activity increase is taken as the difference in activity at the first and last time points for Th0.
Follow-up knock-out RNA-seq analysis
Reads were filtered using Cutadapt (Martin 2011) for the Smart-seq2 TSO and mapped using GSNAP (Wu et al., 2016)þ. The software
featureCounts was then used to produce a final count table (Liao et al., 2014b)þ. The effects of the KO was studied using an EdgeR
(Robinson et al., 2010) linear regression model using the KO with scrambled sgRNA as reference point. We studied the impact of
the virus infection level, measured as a function of BFP, and found it to be confounding. To obtain stronger DE effect for future
KO experiments we recommend that non-infected cells are removed by FACS sorting rather than puromycin selection. Individual
replicates were compared in terms of p value and correlation of DE genes when one sgRNA was used versus when several sgRNAs
targeting the same gene were pooled. Libraries with low replicability or low virus infection were manually removed.
We define a differentiation axis as the DE genes (using DEseq2) from the RNA-seq time-course, Th0 versus Th2 at t = 72h, with
p < 10�10. The activation axis is similarly defined as the DE genes Th0 at t = 0h versus Th0 at t = 72h, with p < 10�10.
Follow-up overexpression RNA-seq analysis
Presence of the overexpressed gene was verified by manual inspection of RNA-seq reads as well as p-value in DE gene list.
Constructs failing this test were excluded. DESeq2 was used for the analysis and we tested 3 linear models: �treatment,
�treatment + mouse, and treatment versus all_samples. They all give consistent results. Here we report using the model �treatment +
mouse, and do not report genes which were less consistent between the models. Interestingly we obtained two clones of Lrrc40,
where one was truncated on the 30, but they qualitatively yield the same DE genes during overexpression, and cluster together using
tSNE (data not shown). We have deposited both versions to Addgene, but used the full-length Lrrc40 DE gene list for validation.
For sequencing data, see Addgene entry.
Clustering and analysis of ChIP-seq datasets
Additional BED-files of ChIP-seq datasets were downloaded from Cistrome (Liu et al., 2011). The following external datasets were
included, in addition to the 3xFLAG BHLHE40 & PPARG, and our endogenous BATF, IRF4 and GATA3 ChIP-seq: ASCL2 Th0 over-

The Rtsne package (Krijthe 2015) was used on a matrix consisting of 1 wherever a gene had a close ChIP peak according to an-
notatePeaks.pl (Heinz et al., 2010), otherwise 0. To generate the network diagrams, the output of annotatePeaks.pl was processed
with R to select peaks near the TSS of chosen genes. The network was written to an output file and rendered using Graphviz (https://
www.graphviz.org).

 Figure S5. HOMER De Novo Motif Discovery in 3xFLAG Overexpression ChIP-Seq, Related to Figure 5
Top: motifs found under peaks after BHLHE40 ChIP: BHLHE40 is the only highly significant motif. Bottom: Motifs found under peaks after PPARG ChIP: Several
highly significant motifs exist for PPARG, with the top motif being of the AP-1 family (Fra1 is also known as Fosl1). As expected from comparison with other
ChIP-seq datasets, the BATF:IRF4 and GATA3 motifs are also present.
 Figure S6. TF Network of Th2 Differentiation Based on ChIP-Seq Data, Related to Figure 6
(A) Network of Th2 transcription factors based on ChIP-seq peaks, focused on manually curated genes that are DE in activation.
(B) UCSC genome browser screenshots of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, focusing on two examples of activation related genes.
