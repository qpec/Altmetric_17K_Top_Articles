Background: Efficiency and fiscal responsibility are important to the equal, safe,
and effective delivery of care in the emergency department, where all presenting
patients must be evaluated for emergent conditions. Health care professionals’
understanding of the costs of care is a first step to developing rational approaches
for the efficient distribution of the finite resources hospitals and emergency depart-
ments have at their disposal to reduce costs to patients and health care systems.
Objective: To determine emergency department health care professionals’ knowl-
edge of the costs to patients of routine care delivered in the emergency department.
Methods: An internet-based survey of currently practicing emergency medicine
health care professionals with various levels of training (physicians, residents, phys-
ician assistants, and nurse practitioners) was conducted to evaluate their ability to
identify the cost of care for 3 common presentations to the emergency department:
abdominal pain, dyspnea, and sore throat.
Results: Four hundred forty-one emergency medicine health care professionals par-
ticipated. In the 3 cases presented, correct costs were determined by 43.0%, 32.0%,
and 40.1% of participants, respectively. Geographic region was not related to cost
determination. Larger institution size was related to greater cost chosen (P=.01).
Higher level of training was significantly correlated with perceived understanding
of cost (P<.001); however, it was not related to accurate cost assessment in this
study.
Conclusion: Emergency medicine health care professionals have an inadequate
understanding of the costs associated with care routinely provided in the emergency
department.

T
he current state of emergency department (ED) care in the United States requires
that efficiency and fiscal responsibility take a high priority to ensure that evalu-
ation and, if indicated, care be given to all patients effectively, equally, and
safely. Unique among medical specialties, EDs operate within a system of finite resources
to deliver care to patients with emergency medical conditions without regard to ability to
pay for that care.1 At hospitals that accept federal funding, the Emergency Medicine
Treatment and Active Labor Act requires that EDs provide an appropriate medical screen-
ing examination for any patient who requests it to determine whether an emergency

 medical condition exists or whether the patient is in
active labor regardless of citizenship, legal status, or
ability to pay for care. Emergency health care profes-
sionals (HCPs), therefore, must dictate many tasks,
such as conducting screening examinations in triage,
ordering tests, or transferring patients to higher levels
of care. This mandate to treat means that patients
receive the necessary care, but it also means that they
will be billed for this care. It is not uncommon for this
burden to be transferred to taxpayers or to the hospital.2
On average, ED HCPs are unlikely to see patients
again, which limits patient feedback to their ED HCPs
concerning the cost of the care. This relationship is in
stark contrast to that between patients and their
primary care physicians, which is established and
more intimate, and patients can discuss costs with their
physicians. The ED HCPs should strive to deliver the
most effective and highest quality care that is indicated
while at the same time taking into consideration how
costs affect not only the patient but the entire health
care system. Studies have looked at physicians’ under-
standing of the costs of testing and medications across
many specialties.3,4 Studies dating back to the 1970s
have been included in articles that show poor physician
understanding of tests and medication cost.3,4 A survey-
based study5 in June 2014 showed that understanding
had not improved. The costs of diagnostic tests and
medications have routinely been evaluated separately
but not in the context of a patient encounter.3-5
Care delivered in an ED can be more expensive than
care delivered in the outpatient setting.6 This factor
makes the ED an excellent place to improve cost
control. Being properly informed of cost is a logical
first step to delivering cost-effective care in the ED.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the under-
standing of ED HCPs of various levels with regard to
the costs associated with the management of 3
common ED presentations using patient-encounter
vignettes. We hypothesized that the HCPs’ ability to
accurately determine the costs would be poor (<50%).
Methods
Participants were recruited via e-mail. E-mails were
sent to 107 emergency medicine program directors
through the Council of Residency Directors listserv
requesting program directors to forward the participa-
tion information to all of their ED attendings, residents,
physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. Survey
responses were gathered from May 5, 2015, through
July 28, 2015. The inclusion criteria were any HCP
currently practicing in an ED in the United States and
employed at an ED residency site. The institutional
review board approved this study.
Survey
Data
were
collected
through
an
online
survey
(SurveyMonkey). The demographic portion of the
survey asked for level of training, primary practice loca-
tion, and institution size. The states where participants
practiced were consolidated into regions to correspond
with regional divisions used by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The cost-assessment portion of the survey presented 3
clinical vignettes of common presentations to the ED:
(1) a 35-year-old woman with abdominal pain, (2) a
57-year-old man with dyspnea, and (3) a 7-year-old
boy with a sore throat (Table 1). Participants were
asked to read the vignette, which consisted of a medical
history, focused physical examination, diagnostic tests,
and interventions. They were then given the choice of 4
ranges representing the total cost of ED care for each
patient. The correct range had been predetermined by
the billing department at Lakeland Health, which coded
the vignette encounters and produced billing charges for
the different levels of care as well as for the interven-
tions provided to the patients in the vignettes.
Statistical Analysis
We compared participant demographics against each
cost range as well as correct vs incorrect answers.
Analysis focused on comparison using nonparametric

ED costs and level of training—were also compared
using the χ2 test. Participants had to reply to both

 Statistical significance was defined as P<.05. Analysis
was performed with SPSS software (IBM).
Results
In total, 441 surveys were returned. Missing responses
were found in 32 surveys (7.3%); however, all ques-
tions had a minimum of 409 responses and, therefore,
were included in the study. Descriptive characteristics
of the study participants are presented in Table 2.
Participants were from the east (126 [28.6]), west (47
[10.7]), south (61 [13.9]), and Midwest (206 [46.8])
regions of the United States, including 33 states,
Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, and comprised
HCPs of various levels of experience (Table 2).
Main Outcome Measures
For each of the 3 case vignettes, the most common
answer chosen by participants was correct, but overall,
participants more frequently chose one of the incorrect
answer choices. Case 1 had the greatest number of
correct responses (182 [43.0%]) followed by case 3
(164 [40.1%]) and case 2 (132 [32.0%]). In case 2, the
second most common response, which was incorrect,
was given 31.8% of the time and represents a difference
of 1 response (132 vs 131 responses). More advanced
level of training was associated with choosing a higher
cost range for the care delivered in the 3 cases (P=.065,
.004, and <.001, respectively).
Secondary Outcome Measures
Some statistically significant relationships were found
between the demographic data and the responses to the
vignettes. Participants from tertiary hospitals chose
higher cost assessment compared with those from com-
munity or rural hospitals for the 3 cases (P=.01, .046,
and .396, respectively). Higher level of training was
strongly correlated with increased perceived under-
standing of cost of care (P<.001). Region of the
country showed no relationship to cost assessment
(P=.874, .455, and .916, respectively).
Discussion
Our survey was designed to mimic real-life scenarios
using patient encounter vignettes, as opposed to
presenting individual tests or medications, as other
similar studies have done.3-5 We found that ED HCPs
continue to have an inadequate overall understanding
of the cost of care in the ED. Displaying the costs of
diagnostic tests in the electronic health record and com-
puterized physician order entry could be a useful way to
educate HCPs. This strategy has been studied and
showed a modest decrease in the rate of ordering tests
whose cost was displayed.7,8 A 1996 study9 showed
that making patient charges available to HCPs reduced
the tests and medications ordered and, in turn, patient
costs while maintaining effective and safe care.

 The most recent projection by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services shows that national
health expenditures will nearly double, from $2.9 trillion
in 2013 to $5.5 trillion in 2025, a rate that will outpace
national gross domestic product by 1.2% per year
during this period.10,11 Studies12,13 have shown that phy-
sicians are generally cost-conscious and feel that it is
their responsibility to control costs where possible for
both patients and the health care system. These findings
seem to indicate that improved understanding of cost
would translate to decreased cost to both patients and
the health care system overall to some degree.
In the current study, higher level of training had a
significant positive correlation with perceived under-
standing of costs of care. However, a higher level of
training was not predictive of correct responses to the
cost of care chosen. It is likely that over a career, a
physician gains knowledge about the costs of various
interventions, such as computed tomographic imaging,
leading to a perception of increased understanding.
However, we suspect that other fees, not in the control
of these HCPs, such as room fees, nursing fees, and
radiologist fees, can make up a large percentage of a
patient’s bill for an encounter. Education about these
fees could inform HCPs’ decisions and aid in commu-
nication in the ED.
The relationship between being employed at a
tertiary hospital and choosing a higher cost could be
due to the location of most of these facilities in larger
cities where prices may be higher. It could also be
explained by the realization of HCPs who work in this
environment that a larger facility with more equipment
and personnel carries higher inherent costs. Institution
size and reputation have both been reported to be
related to increased costs.14
Limitations
This study should be interpreted in the context of some
limitations. In the dissemination of the survey, we relied
on program directors to forward the survey to the speci-
fied HCPs. Although a large number of surveys were
returned, the total number of possible participants
cannot be defined, making a response percentage
impossible to calculate.
An additional limitation of this study arises from the
wording of the survey questions. The questions asked
“What is the total cost of the care delivered in the
following scenario?” The intent of the question was to
assess what the patient would be charged for the care
provided; however, participants could have interpreted
the question as assessing costs charged to the hospital,
thus confounding those data.
It is recognized that the cost ranges provided for the 3
scenarios would not apply to every hospital in the United
States. The data showed that geographic region held no
relationship to the range chosen and that even at large
tertiary hospitals, where participants were more likely to
choose a higher range, in no case was the highest range
the most common answer for this subgroup. The ranges
were left intentionally broad to account for geographical
and institutional differences as much as was feasible.
Not all participants responded to every question,
which slightly decreased the n for some of the data;
however, a response rate of 92.3% to 100% for the indi-
vidual questions was returned.
Conclusion
Health care professionals in the ED continue to have an
inadequate understanding of the costs associated with
care routinely provided in the ED. Education concerning
cost, such as through the computerized physician order
entry, is likely to improve efficiency and decrease costs
to the patients as well as the health care system overall.
