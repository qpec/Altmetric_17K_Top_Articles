Cardiovascular vulnerability of childhood
cancer survivors: time to progress from risk
observation to risk modification

Online publish-ahead-of-print 9 March 2018
This editorial refers to ‘Burden of cardiovascular risk
factors and cardiovascular disease in childhood cancer
survivors: data from the German CVSS-study’†, by J. Faber
et al., on page 1555.
A rising incidence in paediatric cancers and improved long-term sur-
vival rates, reflective of substantial advances in paediatric oncology
care, contribute to a growing population of childhood cancer sur-
vivors. Unfortunately, this cohort manifests excess cardiovascular
(CV) risk throughout survivorship, and CV diseases eventually over-
take subsequent primary cancers as the leading cause of premature
mortality among ageing survivors of childhood cancer.1 In this issue
of the journal, Faber and co-investigators from the German Cardiac
and Vascular Late Sequelae in Long-Term Survivors of Childhood
Cancer (CVSS) study further our appreciation of the magnitude of
this excess CV risk.2
The CVSS-study investigators prospectively evaluated 1002 sur-
vivors, aged 23–48 years, who were treated prior their 15th birthday
for childhood cancer between 1980 and 1990, using the same sys-
tematic standardized clinical and laboratory CV screening that was
employed in the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS). Prevalence of CV
risk factors and CV disease among survivors was compared with that
of the GHS population, and with that of two further German
population-based cohorts. The definition of CV disease was broad,
including congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, stroke, per-
ipheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation, and venous thrombo-embol-
ism, determined by patient interview and supplemented with review
of medical records. This cohort had an age-adjusted increased risk of
38% for the development of hypertension and 26% for dyslipidaemia
compared with GHS participants. Hypertension and dyslipidaemia
were each present in roughly a quarter of survivors, and occurred
�6–8 years earlier than in the general population. At least one of the
diseases included in the aggregate definition of CV disease was
prevalent in 4.5% of survivors, with congestive heart failure and ven-
ous thrombo-embolism accounting for 64% of all CV disease. The
risk of CV disease among survivors was almost twice (relative risk
1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.34–2.66) that of the general popula-
tion, with survivors developing CV disease on average 7.9 years prior
to GHS participants.2
The prospective and systematic phenotyping of survivors and
comparison with control cohorts are welcome strengths of this
study. Previous reports on the burden of CV disease in childhood
cancer survivors have mostly relied on patient-reported outcomes
and/or have failed to consider relevant controls. Another prospective
evaluation from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study of 1853 adult sur-
vivors of childhood cancer, that included fasting lipid panels, detected
hypertension and dyslipidaemia in 23% and 62% of participants, re-
spectively.3 While the prevalence of hypertension is similar, the
lower prevalence of dyslipidaemia in the CVSS-study is in part ex-
plained by different definitions of dyslipidaemia in the two studies. In
addition, hypertension was defined as a systolic and/or diastolic blood
pressure of >
_140/90 mmHg in both studies, whereas application of
lower cut-off points for hypertension of >
_130/80 mmHg, endorsed
by the 2017 American Heart Association/American College of
Cardiology hypertension guideline,4 would reclassify a significantly
higher proportion of these survivors as hypertensive.
Cardiovascular disease considered by Faber and colleagues
focuses on reports of clinically manifest diagnoses only, and is exclu-
sive of subclinical or undiagnosed overt CV injury (Take home figure).
Thus, the prevalence of ‘CV disease’ in this cohort is an underesti-
mate of the true burden of CV disease when asymptomatic left ven-
tricular (LV) dysfunction, valvular disease, pericardial disease,
conduction disease, and silent coronary artery disease are con-
sidered. The CVSS-study investigators have tremendous potential for
incremental phenotyping of this cohort by including additional CV
testing such as echocardiography. Echocardiographic evaluation that

included global longitudinal strain and diastolic function performed
by the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study identified cardiac dysfunction in
one-third of survivors with a normal LV ejection fraction.5 However,
these studies are limited by the cross-sectional, single time point na-
ture of assessment, and future studies with serial testing over time
are needed to help determine the natural history and adverse associ-
ations of these subclinical abnormalities among survivors.
It should be noted that while Faber and colleagues identified a
prevalence of dyslipidaemia in 28% and hypertension in 23%, only
11% of survivors were on any CV medication.2 Although many fac-
tors contribute, use of pharmacological interventions in less than half
of survivors with hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia is probably in
part related to a reluctance to initiate drug therapy in younger pa-
tients (mean age of survivors in this cohort was 34 years). While life-
style changes are at the cornerstone of blood pressure and lipid
management,6,7 a lower threshold for pharmacological intervention
seems appropriate for this high-risk cohort. Traditional tools to esti-
mate CV risk, such as the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation
(SCORE) system7 or the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease
(ASCVD) risk estimator8 that guide treatment decisions in the gen-
eral population, are limited in the survivor cohort given their failure
to consider risk implications of previous cancer therapies.
Cardiovascular screening of childhood cancer survivors is fraught
with challenges, not least related to the latency between cancer
therapies and expression of CV injury. Various groups advocate both
for periodic cardiomyopathy surveillance of childhood cancer sur-
vivors based on age at treatment, cumulative anthracycline exposure,
and whether the heart was irradiated,9–11 and for periodic functional
stress testing following chest radiation therapy, even in the absence
of symptoms.12,13 However, such surveillance is inconsistently
adopted in clinical practice. While clinical responses to overt LV sys-
tolic dysfunction, valve disease, etc. may be clearly apparent, the
prognostic implications of subclinical findings such as LV diastolic dys-
function and abnormal global longitudinal strain in the setting of a
normal LV ejection fraction, and appropriate clinical response to
these findings among survivors are uncertain. In contrast, periodic as-
sessment of blood pressure, lipid, and glycaemic control in childhood
cancer survivors should be less controversial due to availability of
evidence-based interventions.
Healthcare providers must empower survivors to share in the bur-
den of CV surveillance, and have an ethical responsibility to counsel
survivors on their CV vulnerability. A written summary of their can-
cer therapies and personalized recommendations for surveillance for
late effects should be provided to all survivors. Survivors need to be
informed of clinical signs and symptoms that should prompt medical
review. In the current climate of stretched healthcare resources, sur-
vivors will need to become their own advocates for access to appro-
priate CV care. Optimization of modifiable CV risk factors should be
a shared goal of survivors and their providers. Although the preva-
lence of smoking in the CVSS-study sample was significantly lower
than in population-based cohorts, it is concerning that one-fifth of
survivors were smokers.2 This observation emphasizes the oppor-
tunity for health promotion among this cohort already predisposed
to second malignancies and cardiac disease, for which smoking is a
synergistic risk factor.
Childhood cancer survivors represent a medically complex and
currently underserved population at high risk of adverse CV out-
comes. The specific healthcare needs of the growing cohort of ageing

survivors are probably best served through multidisciplinary survivor-
ship clinics that include cardio-oncology expertise. Utilization of sur-
vivor clinics can improve adherence to guidelines for screening for
late effects14 and provide a platform for patient education of excess
CV and non-CV risks. Familiarity of primary care physicians with sur-
veillance guidelines has been shown to be often deficient,15 and so a
shared-care model that fosters close collaboration with survivorship
clinics may help improve quality of care for survivors.
Survivors evaluated in this study by Faber et al. were treated for
cancer between 1980 and 1990, and so findings probably overesti-
mate risk of premature CV disease among survivors of more contem-
porary
childhood cancer
therapies.
Refinements in
radiation
protocols and reductions in cumulative anthracycline exposure are
succeeding in reducing late mortality among 5-year survivors of child-
hood cancer.16 Encouragingly, the British Childhood Cancer Survivor
Study of 34 489 five-year survivors of childhood cancers diagnosed
between 1940 to 2006 found that risk of cardiac mortality was great-
est among those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989, and decreased for
those treated after 1990.17 In addition, the potential impact of contin-
ued integration of newer biological and molecularly targeted agents,
and immunotherapies, for treatment of childhood cancers on subse-
quent CV risk will require prospective evaluation. Furthermore, a
growing appreciation among healthcare providers of the excess CV
risk of survivors and improvements in their CV care should hopefully
improve CV outcomes.
While this work by Faber and colleagues reinforces the excess
burden of CV risk factors and disease among childhood cancer sur-
vivors, future studies must now focus on the many knowledge gaps in
mechanisms, diagnosis, screening, prevention, and management of
CV injury in this cohort. Our understanding of the multifactorial path-
obiology of premature CV disease in childhood cancer survivors that
involves a complex interaction of cancer, cancer treatments, trad-
itional CV risk factors, ageing, and genetics is incomplete. This defi-
ciency has curtailed development of prevention strategies. Similarly,
we lack a mechanistic approach for management of CV disease in sur-
vivors, and instead extrapolate treatment data from non-cancer co-
horts. There is a pressing need for research to inform practice
guidelines for screening, prevention, and management. There are
now sufficient observational data that childhood cancer survivors
represent a high-CV risk cohort that warrant more comprehensive
care systems to improve CV outcomes. It is time to progress from
risk observation to risk modification.
