Abstract
In light of the increasing refusal of some parents to vaccinate children, public health strate-
gies have focused on increasing knowledge and awareness based on a “knowledge-deficit”
approach. However, decisions about vaccination are based on more than mere knowledge
of risks, costs, and benefits. Individual decision making about vaccinating involves many
other factors including those related to emotion, culture, religion, and socio-political context.
In this paper, we use a nationally representative internet survey in the U.S. to investigate
socio-political characteristics to assess attitudes about vaccination. In particular, we con-
sider how political ideology and trust affect opinions about vaccinations for flu, pertussis,
and measles. Our findings demonstrate that ideology has a direct effect on vaccine atti-
tudes. In particular, conservative respondents are less likely to express pro-vaccination
beliefs than other individuals. Furthermore, ideology also has an indirect effect on immuni-
zation propensity. The ideology variable predicts an indicator capturing trust in government
medical experts, which in turn helps to explain individual-level variation with regards to atti-
tudes about vaccine choice.
Introduction
One of the most successful public health interventions has been infant and childhood immuni-
zation programs. In 1900, 16 out of every one hundred American children died from disease
before age five [1]. By the close of the century, 97% of American schoolchildren received vac-
cines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and Haemophilus
influenzae type b (Hib) by first grade [1]. While widespread vaccinations have nearly eradi-
cated what were once very common and deadly diseases, the unfortunate irony is that without
threat of such deadly diseases the proportion of the population that is not adequately vacci-
nated has grown [2]. In 2015, the national vaccination coverage among children aged 19–35
months was 91.9% for recommended MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) doses, but in states
such as Colorado, Ohio, and West Virginia the coverage is as low as 86.0% [3]. For measles,
the proportion of the population that should be vaccinated for prevention of disease outbreak
is 90–95% [4]. Thus, the fact that vaccination coverage is dropping is particularly concerning
especially in light of recent outbreaks.
Despite all 50 states requiring children to be vaccinated before attending school, all states
allow exemptions for medical reasons, all but two allow exemptions for religious reasons, and

 almost half allow exemptions for philosophical reasons [5]. Such exemptions contradict the
efforts of the U.S. government to adhere to a federally mandated vaccine schedule and achieve-
ment of universal vaccination to maintain herd immunity. Various reasons for parents not
vaccinating their children exist, from mere oversight [6], socio-economic barriers (that often
interact with race/ethnicity) [7], and for some the result of conscious decisions. Oftentimes the
deliberate decisions of parents are based on parental concern regarding vaccine safety [8] and
efficacy [9,10].
For example, there is a growing parental and public interest in natural products and even
some have taken up the mantel to “green our vaccines” due to public fears of the relationship
between MMR vaccine and autism (a relationship for which no credible empirical evidence
has been found [11]). When vaccinations concern children, as in the case of MMR, parents
lack control over the outcome of vaccination and the potential damage, although extremely
rare (less than 1 in a million), can be long-term or even fatal [12]. Moreover, benefits can be
difficult to calculate, particularly given that the negative consequences of nearly-eradicated dis-
eases are no longer salient. Consequently, many parents give greater weight to the risks of vac-
cines than the benefits [13]. With the ubiquity of the internet and information available online
along with a shifting parent-doctor relationship, parents have become more involved in vacci-
nation decisions and often override the mandated vaccine schedule.
In light of the increasing refusal of some parents to vaccinate children, public health strate-
gies deploy a “knowledge-” or “information-deficit” approach that educates people on the
risks, costs, and benefits of vaccination (and non-vaccination). If individuals respond to risk
information in a straightforward way, it is reasonable that a knowledge-deficit approach would
be successful. However, research across numerous domains suggests that, in general, decision
making under risk is complex and not straightforward [14–22]. There is reason to believe that
vaccine choice is no different [23]. For example, it is known that perceived risk of vaccines is
related to gender (with women perceiving greater vaccine risk than men) as well as a variety of
other demographic characteristics such as age, race, education, and income level, and other
factors such as emotion, culture, religion, and socio-political context [24]. In this paper, we are
interested in two sets of reasons for vaccination decision making and the relationship between
them: ideology and trust.
From a sociological perspective, a number of existing empirical studies indicate that peo-
ple’s ideologies and worldviews strongly influence their perception and acceptance of risk.
That is, rather than understanding risk as a result of individual cognition, Cultural Theory,
attributable to Douglas [25,26] and Douglas and Wildavsky [27], posits that individuals are
embedded in a sociocultural milieu wherein and by which risk is constructed and interpreted
[27]. Specifically, Douglas and Wildavsky use four categories—hierarchical, individualist, fatal-
ist, egalitarian—to understand how each cultural group applies salient values and interprets a
particular phenomenon to be risky or not. Others have built on their work, substantiating the
relationship between these four categories and perception of risk [28–32].
Related, political ideology, defined as the set of beliefs about the proper order of society
[33], has a strong influence on political attitudes and behaviors and general value orientations
—and by extension risk—in a pattern similar to what scholars find with Cultural Theory.
Indeed, some scholars [34] find that some individuals actually respond to egalitarianism and
individualism questions as if they were opposite ends of a single, liberal-conservative contin-
uum, rather than two of four distinct worldviews. This finding demonstrates the close corre-
spondence between Cultural Theory and political ideology and the explanatory value of
political ideology and risk.
Research further bears out the close correspondence between Cultural Theory and political
ideology. Studies find that liberals are more egalitarian and open to change than conservatives

 [35–43]. Others find political conservatives to be more sensitive to threat and more risk averse
than those who are politically liberal [44–46]. Moreover, ideological dispositions can shape sup-
port for or opposition to potentially risky technologies [47,48]. In particular, Rothman and Lich-
ter [47] find that ideology is related to assessments of nuclear power safety for some groups
including journalists and high-level government bureaucrats. Duckit and Sibley [49] distinguish
between social and cultural conservatives (or right-wing authoritarians), who tend to perceive
the world as “dangerous” or unstable, and economic conservatives (or those with high social
dominance orientation), who perceive “the world as a ruthlessly competitive jungle in which the
strong win and the weak lose” [50]. However, both types of conservatives have a desire to reduce
uncertainty and threat and “prioritize traditionalism, rule-following, and acceptance of inequal-
ity” [51]. Thus previous research provides a conceptual linkage between ideology and risk.
In light of the above research findings, political ideology may be of particular importance in
the case of vaccine attitudes. Some might suggest that because vaccinations have not yet been
adopted by a major political party or ideological camp (compared to other issues such as abor-
tion), the public should not possess well-developed partisan or ideological opinions about
them. Although we concur with this assessment, we also suspect there to be ideological opin-
ions about vaccines in the U.S. as a consequence of the aforementioned relationship that exists
between political values and risk (or risky technologies). Moreover, we suspect that conserva-
tives will be less likely to express pro-vaccination attitudes, despite the notorious vaccine skep-
ticism that some liberals, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have adopted. In fact, despite
anecdotes attributing anti-vaccination trends to some enclaves of liberal leaning types, evi-
dence points to more vaccination skepticism among conservatives [52]. Additionally, anti-vac-
cination opinions have been publicly discussed among conservative leaders. For example,
during the 2016 presidential race, several Republican candidates expressed some degree of
skepticism concerning vaccination [53]. Furthermore, Donald Trump has used Twitter to per-
petuate a long debunked linkage between autism and vaccines since as far back as March 2012
[54,55]. By bringing the issue into the highly salient presidential election, Trump could have
motivated an ideological gap in public attitudes about vaccination. The above considerations
allow us to formulate our first testable hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: Individuals who are more conservative are less likely to vaccinate against pre-
ventable diseases than less conservative individuals.
The other set of reasons for anti-vaccination attitudes we are interested in concerns trust,
which has been an area of interest for researchers studying vaccination propensity [56]. Trust is
particularly important when dissenting opinions exist regarding scientific facts and individuals
have to choose between them. For example, are vaccines safe or is there a substantial risk of ill-
ness or death? Typically, individuals are unable to answer this question for themselves given
that they lack the expertise to test vaccine safety or gather data on vaccination risk. Thus, people
need to turn to experts who have either done the research or have access to the relevant infor-
mation. In this context, we distinguish between two kinds of medical experts: government med-
ical experts and primary health care providers. Anti-vaccination attitudes are often correlated
with low levels of trust in the government [9], and lack of trust in corporations and public health
agencies [9]. The less people trust governmental or scientific institutions the more likely they
are to believe a link between vaccines and autism and thus, the less likely they are to demon-
strate support for vaccinations. Given these considerations, we have the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: Individuals with high levels of trust in government medical experts are more
likely to express pro-vaccination attitudes against preventable diseases than individuals
with low levels of trust.

 Separate from trust in medical institutions, individual members of the health care commu-
nity are also likely to influence vaccination attitudes. In particular, high levels of trust in a pri-
mary health care provider, e.g., a pediatrician, is expected to result in more positive attitudes
towards vaccination than low levels of trust:
Hypothesis 3: Individuals with high levels of trust in their primary health care provider are
more likely to express willingness to vaccinate against preventable diseases than individuals
with low levels of trust.
So far, we have argued that ideology and trust influence vaccine attitudes in individuals.
However, there are reasons to believe that these two independent variables also influence each
other. As we discussed in our motivation of hypothesis 1, individuals who are more conserva-
tive are more likely to be skeptical about vaccination. This may be part of a more general pat-
tern of skepticism towards different types of expertise. We know generally that trust in
government vaccination programs, trust in science, and trust in government is usually lower
for conservatives than for liberals [57–59]. Thus it is reasonable to expect that there are lower
levels of trust towards our two types of medical experts among more conservative individuals
than less conservative individuals:
Hypothesis 4: Individuals who are more conservative are less likely to trust government medi-
cal experts than less conservative individuals.
Hypothesis 5: Individuals who are more conservative are less likely to trust primary health
care providers than less conservative individuals
We have additional reasons for expecting support for hypothesis 4, that individuals that are
more conservative are less likely to trust government medical experts than less conservative
individuals. There is evidence that trust in government medical experts, such as the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, can be affected by ideological triggering. This can happen
by signaling group identity, e.g., through partisan news outlets. Receiving information through
partisan outlets allows individuals to selectively credit information related to vaccine risks and
benefits in ways that reflect their ideological dispositions (e.g., vaccines against sexually-trans-
mitted disease would lead to an increase in unprotected sex). The evidence comes from histori-
cal considerations. Consider the difference between the recent politically controversial HPV
vaccine and the uneventful introduction of the HBV vaccine into the U.S. health system in the
1990s. These vaccines protect against the cancer-causing sexually transmitted diseases Human
Papillomavirus and Hepatitis B, respectively. In the case of HBV, most people received their
information about the vaccine and associated risks through their pediatrician, whereas many
parents’ first exposure to information about HPV came through partisan news outlets. The
reason the HPV vaccine received a political spotlight is because Merck, the manufacturer of
the HPV vaccine Gardasil, attempted to get approval through a fast-track review process from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and lobbied a nation-wide campaign directing state
legislatures to add the vaccine to immunization schedules required for school enrollment. If
successful, Merck would have positioned itself in a dominant market position against GlaxoS-
mithKline’s rival product, Cervarix. Without the fast track, both vaccines would have gone
through the same process as the HBV vaccine, avoiding a political spotlight and receiving
approval about three years later. Once in the political spotlight, however, the HPV vaccine lent
itself to ideological objections. Some of these objections were religiously motivated, but not all
(in fact, religious groups did not oppose the FDA approval of the HPV vaccine [60]).
In light of the above considerations, we investigate the socio-political characteristics to
assess attitudes about vaccination. In particular, we consider how political ideology and trust

 affect vaccination beliefs for flu, pertussis (whooping cough), and measles. We select these dis-
eases because of their contrastive features. Flu vaccination is chosen annually while vaccination
for pertussis and measles are done during childhood, and measles outbreaks have received
heightened media attention compared to flu and pertussis. We investigate two forms of trust:
trust in government medical experts (such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and
trust in primary health care provider (such as pediatrician or family doctor). Furthermore, we
investigate the relationship between trust and ideology, where ideology is conceived as a con-
tinuum ranging from very conservative, to moderate, to very liberal.
Our results, in brief, demonstrate that political ideology affects vaccine attitudes indirectly,
by affecting a person’s trust in health-related information sources, and more directly as well.
These findings are consistent with an earlier study by Rabinowitz et al. [61] One of the criti-
cisms of this earlier study was that it made use of a convenience sample, rather than a nation-
ally representative survey. Our study makes use of a larger and nationally representative
sample. Thus our work constitutes an advance in knowledge of this topic by providing an
important replication of earlier work done by others.
Methods
Data collection and sample characteristics
In order to test our hypotheses, we rely on data from a nationally representative online survey,
collected from January 25–27, 2017. Our sample was provided by Survey Sampling Interna-
tional (SSI), a U.S.-based market research firm. After we obtained IRB exemption from our
institution [Project Number: 17–007; exemption granted under category 2 at 45 CFR 46.101
(b)(2)], SSI sent the link to our survey (which was programmed on Qualtrics) to 1,006 respon-
dents. In this context, the survey firm ensured that our final sample would match known
parameters of the U.S. adult population on five major dimensions: age, gender, income, eth-
nicity, and census region. This goal was achieved. As we show in S1 Table, our respondent
pool approximates the overall citizenry of the U.S. very closely.
The survey consisted of three major sections. First, respondents were asked a number of
questions about their political beliefs. Second, subjects answered survey items tapping into atti-
tudes about vaccinations (described below). Finally, all participants provided information
about basic demographic characteristics.
Dependent variable
Our dependent variable taps into individual-level beliefs about vaccinations. We focused on
three diseases: pertussis (whooping cough), measles, and influenza. Measuring vaccination
attitudes is a non-trivial task. It seems likely that the overwhelming majority of our respon-
dents received the vaccine for most preventable diseases at a very young age. As a result, asking
respondents about their own immunization record would not necessarily capture their beliefs
about the topic. An alternative approach would be to study the decisions that subjects make
for their children. This too, is problematic since an exclusive focus on parents would decrease
our sample size significantly and therefore compromise statistical power.
Our solution to this problem is as follows. We designed two hypothetical questions which
correspond to slightly different scenarios. Question 1 simulates a low-risk setting. We asked
our interviewees to imagine that they are currently “missing the vaccine for the following dis-
eases but there is no immediate risk of getting infected.” Respondents then gave separate
answers for pertussis, measles, and influenza and they indicated how likely/unlikely they
would be to get vaccinated. Answer options were (1) very unlikely, (2) unlikely, (3) neither
likely nor unlikely, (4) likely, (5) very likely, and (6) I don’t know. Question 2 corresponds to a

 high-risk scenario. Again, we asked respondents to imagine that they were missing the relevant
vaccines. However, “now there is an outbreak of that disease in [their] community.” Here too,
respondents gave separate answers for the three diseases of interest. The answer options
remained the same.
Our approach leaves us with six analyzable variables (i.e., answers for three diseases in two
different scenarios). We factor-analyzed these items and we expected to obtain two latent
dimensions: one tapping into vaccination attitudes in high-risk scenarios and one capturing
beliefs about immunizations in low-risk settings. This expectation is not supported. Our analy-
sis reveals that all survey items clearly tap into one underlying dimension: the factor loadings
for all variables are above 0.80. Furthermore, only one factor reaches an Eigenvalue of 1 or
higher (Factor 1: 4.56). Given these findings, we created one latent construct (“Vaccination
Attitudes”) and we used this item for our statistical analysis below. Higher values on this vari-
able indicate more favorable views about vaccinations. Factor loadings for this latent construct
are displayed in Table 1. A detailed breakdown of the associations between all vaccine-related
variables can be found in S2 Table.
Exogenous and mediator variables
Our main independent variable is political ideology. In order to capture this concept, we asked
respondents to place themselves on a five-point scale ranging from “very liberal” to “very con-
servative.” About 9.9 percent of respondents self-identified as “very liberal”, 17.5 percent as
“liberal”, 41.4 percent as “moderate”, 21.6 percent as “conservative”, and 9.6 percent as “very
conservative.”
According to the theoretical framework discussed above, ideology should have a direct
effect on vaccination attitudes. In addition, we also hypothesize that an individual’s political
worldview should influence how much trust they place in their primary health care provider as
well as government medical experts. According to Hypotheses 2 and 3, these two types of trust
should then also affect vaccination attitudes. Expressed in more formal terms, we also expect
an indirect effect of ideology on vaccination attitudes that is mediated by trust. We measured
these two mediator variables by asking respondents to what extent they trust their family’s
health care provider and government medical experts (such as Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention) “regarding questions about health.” There were six response options: (1)
strongly distrust, (2) somewhat distrust, (3) neither trust nor distrust, (4) somewhat trust, (5)
strongly trust, and (6) I don’t know. All respondents who answered “I don’t know” were
excluded from the analysis.
Finally, we introduce a standard set of control variables from the public opinion literature
to account for other causes of our dependent variables: age, gender (male 1/0), education,

in this paper can be found in Table 2. Descriptive Statistics for all variables can be found in S3
Table.
Analytical approach
We use a structural equation model to test for both direct and indirect effects. Calculations
were performed using STATA 14. It should be noted that the results of the model we present
herein use as the dependent variable the latent construct, described above. However, to dem-
onstrate the robustness of our results we also estimated six separate models using each of the
six base constructs as the outcome variable. The results are substantively identical and can be
found in S4 Table.
The following three indices (and standard cutoffs), recommended by Hu and Bentler [62],
were used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model: (a) the Standardized Root Mean Square
Residual (SRMR), (b) the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and (c) the
Comparative Fit Index (CFI); a model was considered to have a good fit if SRMR was below
0.05, RMSEA was below 0.05, and CFI was 0.95 or more. The results revealed that the model
fits the data very well: SRMR = 0.02; RMSEA = 0.04; and CFI = 0.97.
Results and discussion
Direct effects
Fig 1 provides results from our path model. We report unstandardized coefficients, standard
errors as well as p-values. As predicted by Hypothesis 1, ideology has a strong and statistically
significant effect on vaccination attitudes (B = -0.10; std. error: 0.03; p<0.01). More specifi-
cally, conservative respondents are less likely to indicate that they would vaccinate against
pertussis, measles, and influenza than other individuals. Furthermore, both trust in health
care provider (B = 0.27; std. error: 0.04; p<0.01) and trust in government medical experts
(B = 0.19; std. error: 0.03; p<0.01) have direct effects on our dependent variable. For both vari-
ables, the path coefficient is positive and statistically significant which suggests that people
with faith in these two entities are also more likely to indicate that they would vaccinate if they
missed the immunization. These empirical findings are in line with Hypotheses 2 and 3 of this
paper.

 Indirect effects
According to Hypotheses 4 and 5, an individual’s political worldview should influence their
level of trust in various health care-related information sources. Our statistical analysis pro-
vides evidence for only one of these paths. We see that ideology has a strong and statistically
significant effect on trust in government medical experts (B = -0.18; std. error: 0.03; p<0.01).
In particular, more conservative respondents tend to express lower levels of trust in institu-
tions like the CDC than their less conservative counterparts. Contrary to our theoretical ex-
pectations however, we find no evidence in support of Hypothesis 5. In other words, an
individual’s political worldview does not seem to influence the extent to which they trust their
family’s primary health care provider (B = -0.02; std. error: 0.02; p<0.41).
These findings imply that there is, in fact, an indirect effect of ideology on vaccination atti-
tudes that is mediated by trust in government medical experts. As we show in Table 3, the esti-
mated size of this indirect effect is -0.04 (std. error: 0.01; p<0.01). This amounts to about 29
percent of the total ideology effect on our dependent variable (B = -0.14; std. error: 0.03;
p<0.01). Taking into account all pathways in Fig 1, “strong conservatives” are thus estimated
to score 0.56 points lower on our latent scale than “strong liberals.” This means that the overall
effect of ideology is not only statistically significant but also substantively meaningful.
Discussion of control variables
Finally, we turn to a discussion of the direct effects of our control variables. Table 3 demon-
strates that vaccination attitudes are not only a function of trust and ideology but also of
other socio-demographic characteristics. In particular, age and income seem to affect how

 individuals think about vaccine choice. According to our results, older citizens have slightly
more negative views about immunizations than younger respondents (B = -0.006; std. error:
0.002; p<0.01). By contrast, income (B = 0.03; std. error: 0.01; p<0.01) has a positive effect on
this dependent variable. This suggests that vaccine attitudes are at least partially driven by the
resources that respondents have at their disposal.
Conclusion
Decisions regarding vaccination are more complicated than simply considering risks, costs,
and benefits. In this paper we argued that socio-political characteristics of individuals shape
their vaccination attitudes. More specifically, we examined the role of ideology, trust, and the
relationship between these and attitudes about vaccination. Our findings corroborate analyses
that show that the intent to vaccinate differs among conservatives and liberals with conserva-
tives expressing less intent to vaccinate. Similarly, those with lower levels of trust in govern-
ment medical experts are also less likely to express intent to vaccinate, and these individuals
also tend to be conservative. What has been less understood, however, is the nature of the rela-
tionship between ideology and trust. Our findings suggest that ideology has two routes in
affecting people’s vaccination attitude. One is direct, independent of trust. The other route
goes through trust. That is, a person’s ideology impacts who they trust such that they can selec-
tively credit information related to vaccine risks and benefits in ways that reflect their ideology.
We thus establish a direction in the relationship between ideology and trust, namely from ide-
ology to trust.
Our findings may provide insights into addressing growing vaccine refusal. Current strate-
gies tend to be driven by a knowledge-deficit approach, attempting to persuade the public by
appealing to risks. While we do see that vaccine attitudes are partially driven by resources, our
findings suggest that the success of knowledge-deficit strategies will be limited by whether
individuals trust the sources by which they are informed of risks and benefits, where this trust
in turn can be limited by ideology. These results and conclusions are consistent with earlier
work by Rabinowitz et al. [61]. There it is argued that in the domain of vaccination choice (in
addition to other domains such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and sexual behavior), the
perception of facts and beliefs, particularly perceptions of social norms, can differ between
conservatives, moderates, and liberals. We add to this the importance of variation in trust
