Abstract
Objectives: To report overall survival and local control for patients identified in the RSSearch® Patient Registry with
metastatic cancer to the lung treated with SBRT.
Methods: Seven hundred two patients were identified with lung metastases in the RSSearch® Registry. Of these
patients, 577 patients had SBRT dose and fractionation information available. Patients were excluded if they
received prior surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency ablation to the SBRT treated area. Between April 2004-July 2015,
447 patients treated with SBRT at 30 academic and community-based centers were evaluable for overall survival
(OS). Three hundred four patients with 327 lesions were evaluable for local control (LC). All doses were converted
to Monte Carlo equivalents and subsequent BED Gy10 for dose response analysis.
Results: Median age was 69 years (range, 18–93 years). Median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 90 (range 25/
75% 80–100). 49.2% of patients had prior systemic therapy. Median metastasis volume was 10.58 cc (range 25/
75% 3.7–25.54 cc). Site of primary tumor included colorectal (25.7%), lung (16.6%), head and neck (11.4%), breast
(9.2%), kidney (8.1%), skin (6.5%) and other (22.1%). Median dose was 50 Gy (range 25/75% 48–54) delivered in 3
fractions (range 25/75% 3–5) with a median BED of 100Gy10 (range 25/75% 81–136).
Median OS for the entire group was 26 months, with actuarial 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of 74.1%, 33.3, and 21.8%, respectively.
Patients with head and neck and breast cancers had longer median OS of 37 and 32 months respectively, compared to
colorectal (30 months) and lung (26 months) which corresponded to 3-year actuarial OS of 51.8 and 47.9% for head and
neck and breast respectively, compared to 35.8% for colorectal and 31.2% for lung.
The median LC for all patients was 53 months, with actuarial 1-, 3-, and 5-year LC rates of 80.4, 58.9, and 46.3%,
respectively. There was no difference in LC by primary histologic type (p = 0.49). Improved LC was observed for
lung metastases that received SBRT doses of BED ≥100Gy10 with 3-year LC rate of 77.1% compared to 45% for lung
metastases treated with BED < 100Gy10 (p = 0.01). Smaller tumor volumes (<11 cc) had improved LC compared to
tumor volumes > 11 cc. (p = 0.005) Two-year LC rates for tumor volumes < 11 cc, 11–27 cc and > 27 cc were 72.9, 64.2
and 45.6%, respectively. This correlated with improved OS with 2-year OS rates of 62.4, 60.9 and 46.2% for tumor
volumes < 11 cc, 11–27 cc and > 27 cc, respectively (p = 0.0023). In a subset of patients who received BED ≥100Gy10, 2-
year LC rates for tumor volumes < 11 cc, 11–27 cc and > 27 cc were 82.8, 58.9 and 68.6%, respectively (p = 0.0244), and
2-year OS rates were 66.0, 58.8 and 28.5%, respectively (p = 0.0081).
Conclusion: Excellent OS and LC is achievable with SBRT utilizing BED ≥100Gy10 for lung metastases according to the
RSSearch® Registry data. Patients with small lung metastases (volumes < 11 cc) had better LC and OS when using SBRT
doses of BED ≥100Gy10. Further studies to evaluate a difference, if any, between various tumor types will require a
larger number of patients.

 Introduction
Pulmonary metastases are a very frequent occurrence in
patients with cancer. One series of a thousand patients
found that 50% who suffered a malignancy-related death
had the presence of pulmonary metastases at the time of
autopsy [1]. A large surgical series of cancer patients
with lung metastases treated with metastasectomy re-
vealed a 15-year survival of 22%, an unexpected outcome
for patients with stage 4 disease [2]. Researchers have
found genomic differences in microRNA expression of
these limited metastatic tumors compared to their
widely metastatic counterparts, lending credence to the
idea that our binary system of local or metastatic disease
might be incorrect [3, 4]. Hellman et al. coined a limited
metastatic state titled oligometastases where aggressive
surgical and ablative therapies could potentially lead to
long disease free intervals [5].
Metastasectomy for lung metastases has been the
standard of care but is often not possible due to medical
comorbidities, extrathoracic disease, unresectable metas-
tases, or short disease free intervals. An ablative therapy
such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has
been reported in many retrospective reports for lung
metastases however, with limited sample size [6]. We
present a large series of metastatic lung tumors treated
with SBRT using the RSSearch® Registry.
Materials and methods
The RSSearch® Registry is an international, web-based
registry designed for SBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery
(SRS) research with currently over 18,000 patients enrolled
(www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01885299) [7]. RSSearch® was
designed to standardize the collection of patient screening,
treatment and outcome data for patients treated with SBRT
and SRS with the goal of conducting research outcomes
analysis to identify the most effective and appropriate
clinical uses of SRS/SBRT. RSSearch® is managed by the
Radiosurgery Society, a non-profit, professional medical
society (www.therss.org) and adheres to the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
in all domains including database security, data trans-
mission, and confidentiality. The database is contracted
and maintained by Advertek (Nashville, TN). An audit
was performed by the study investigators of sites par-
ticipating in this study which outlined missing data
points. Centers were asked to provide missing data
which was generally successful in recapturing this data;
however we are unable to quantify its success rate.
Data collected in RSSearch® includes the following cat-
egories: patient demographics, treated lesion (size, volume,
location), treatment plan including use of surgery or
chemotherapy, information on SBRT delivery including
dose and fractionation, toxicity, symptom control, lesion
response, survival data, and progression data. Aggregate
de-identified data is accessible by RSSearch® administra-
tors. Requests for retrospective data analysis are sent to
the RSSearch® Review Committee, which approves or
denies all requests for data.
Lesion locations and SBRT treatment sites are described
using the World Health Organization (WHO) International
Classification of Diseases (ICD), version 9 codes. Toxicity
data is coded using the Common Toxicity Criteria for
Adverse Event Reporting, version 3. The majority of pa-
tients
were
treated
with
the
CyberKnife™
Robotic
Radiosurgery System (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and
2 patients were treated with Truebeam (Varian Medical
Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Due to the nature of the
current study using registry data, no pre-defined treat-
ment planning criteria were enforced and instead relied
upon individual institutional guidelines. After consen-
sus review of the physicians from the treatment sites,
the majority of patients were simulated in the supine
position using computed tomography (CT) scanning
above and below the region of interest during inspir-
ation, expiration, and free breathing. One millimeter
slice reconstruction of the treatment planning area was
transferred to the treatment planning station. Positron
emission tomography (PET) scans were used to aid in
target volume delineation via image fusion to the CT
scan. Target volumes were delineated by physician (ra-
diation oncologist, pulmonologist, or surgeon) using
CT and PET scans. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was
often used as the clinical target volume (CTV), with a
3–10 mm margin added circumferentially to define the
planning target volume (PTV).
Real time tumor tracking was incorporated for patients
treated with CyberKnife using the Synchrony® Respira-
tory Motion Tracking System. Radiation dosimetry on
patients treated on the CyberKnife system was planned
using the MultiPlan® System (Accuray Incorporated,
Sunnyvale, CA) which incorporated non-isocentric and
non-coplanar radiation delivery using Monte Carlo or
Ray Tracing algorithms. Ray Tracing generally overesti-
mates tumor dose in the lung due to lack of capacity to
account
for
the
lung-tumor
density
heterogeneity.
Therefore Ray Tracing dose was converted into a more
accurate Monte Carlo equivalent dose using an equation
based on the tumor size. Patients who did not have
tumor size information available within the RSSearch®
Registry were excluded from BED analysis (n = 20). In
comparing various fractionation schema and doses, bio-
logically effective dose (BED Gy10) was calculated using
the linear quadratic model.
All centers performing SBRT/SRS are able to participate
in RSSearch®. No compensation is given to patient partici-
pants or participating centers. Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approval is required at each participating center, and
patients must give informed consent. Data is entered into

 RSSearch® usually in a prospective fashion however retro-
spective data entry is allowed and coded as such.
Patient follow-up was performed per institutional guide-
lines and the date of last follow up used for actuarial ana-
lysis with all time intervals considered. Patients were
censored for survival at time of death and for local control
at time of local failure. All participating centers reported
follow-up clinical and imaging data. Local progression was
evaluated independently for each lesion at the participat-
ing institution following a modified RECIST (Response
Evaluation and Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria which
defined local progression as at least a 20% increase in the
size of lesions and/or appearance of one or more lesions
in target treatment location and local control was defined
as disappearance of, decrease in, or no increase in size of
the treated lesions.
Statistical analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were performed using GraphPad and Instat Software, La
Jolla, CA. Overall survival was calculated for each pa-
tient using the first date of SBRT to date of death or date
of last follow up. Specific cause of death was not re-
ported for all patients in RSSearch® and therefore not
evaluated in this study. Local failure was determined for
each treated tumor using last date of SBRT to date of
physician reported failure. Subgroups were compared
using X2, log-rank tests and Gehan-Breslow Wilcoxon
tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

RSSearch® Registry, please see the previous descriptive
paper on its creation and use [7, 8].
Results
Patient characteristics
Between April 2004 and July 2015, 702 patients with
lung metastases from 28 centers in the US, one center
from Germany and one center from Australia, were
identified in the RSSearch®Patient Registry. Of those
patients, 577 had dose and fractionation information
available. One hundred thirty patients were excluded
from the study because of previous surgery, SBRT, or ra-
diofrequency ablation (RFA) to the SBRT-treated area.
This resulted in 447 patients with lung metastases
treated with SBRT evaluable for survival. We are unable
to say with certainty that these patients had no other
metastatic sites due to the nature of our data collection.
There were 304 of these patients with 327 lesions evalu-
able for LC. Median age of the group was 69 years
(range 18–93). Additional patient demographics and
characteristics are found in Table 1.
Tumor characteristics
Primary tumor types included colorectal (CRC) (25.7%),
lung (16.6%), head and neck (H&N) (11.4%), breast
(9.2%), skin (6.5%), gynecologic (6%), sarcoma (4%),
bladder/ureter (4%), and other (16%). Median Karnofsky
Performance Status (KPS) was 90 (range 25%/75% 80–
100). Median follow up was 13 months (range 25%/75%
6–26 months, max 123 months). Median number of me-
tastases was 1 (range 1–3). Median metastasis size was
10.58 cc (range 0.1–654.5 cc).
Treatment characteristics
Median dose of SBRT to target metastasis was 50 Gy
(range 25%/75% 48–54 Gy). The median corrected
Monte Carlo dose was 45.6 Gy (range 25%/75% 40.6–
50.7 Gy). The median bioequivalent dose was 100Gy10
(range 25%/75% 81–136). Median number of fractions

10–17 Gy/fraction).
Outcome data
Median overall survival (OS) for the entire group was
26 months. The 1-, 3- and 5- year OS were 74.1, 33.3, and
21.8% of patients, respectively (Fig. 1). Median LC for the
entire group was 53 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year LC
rates were 80.4, 58.9, and 46.2%, respectively (Fig. 2).
We investigated whether primary tumor type (breast,
lung, colorectal cancer (CRC), head and neck or other)
had an effect on LC and OS following SBRT treatment.
There was no statistical difference in LC rates (p = 0.485
by log-rank test; p = 0.181 by Gehan-Breslow Wilcoxon
test, Fig. 3a) for the primary tumor types. The 2-year LC
rates for breast, lung, CRC, head and neck, and other
primaries were 72.4, 55.6, 65.4, 74.4 and 63.1%, respect-
ively. A statistical difference in OS rates was observed
for primary tumor types, with head and neck patients
having a median OS of 37 months, breast cancer
patients had a median OS of 32 months, CRC patients
had a median OS of 30 months, lung cancer patients
had a median OS of 26 months, and all other primary
tumors had a median OS of 20 months (p = 0.004 by
log-rank test; p = 0.0024 by Gehan-Breslow Wilcoxon
test, Fig. 3b). The 3-year OS rates for breast, CRC, lung,
head and neck, and other primary tumors were 47.9,
31.3, 35.8, 51.8, and 23.1%, respectively.
We next investigated whether lung metastases tumor
volume was associated with LC and/or OS. Because me-
dian and average metastasis volumes were 10.58 cc and
26.72 cc, respectively, lesions were stratified into three
groups: tumor volume <11 cc, 11–27 cc, and >27 cc. A

 statistical difference was noted between the three groups,
with improved LC for smaller tumors. Two-year LC was
72.9, 64.2 and 45.6% for tumor volumes < 11 cc, 11–27 cc
and > 27 cc, respectively (p = 0.0005 by log-rank test; p =
0.0011 by Gehan-Breslow Wilcoxon test Fig. 4a). This
translated into improved OS, with 2-year OS of 62.4, 60.9,
46.1% for tumor volumes < 11 cc, 11–27 cc, and > 27 cc,
respectively, and median OS for lesions <11 cc, 11–27 cc,
and >27 cc was 29, 31, and 21 months respectively (p =
0.0023 by log-rank test; p = 0.0011 by Gehan-Breslow Wil-
coxon test, Fig. 4b).
All patients were stratified by BED < 100Gy10 and
BED ≥100Gy10 and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to
assess LC and OS. Lung metastases treated with BED
≥100Gy10 had improved LC compared to lesions that
received BED ≤ 100Gy10 (Fig. 5a). LC rates at 1-, 3-, and
5-years were 82.6, 71.1, and 66.4%, respectively, for le-
sions treated with BED ≥ 100Gy10, and 77.6, 44.9 and
30.7%, respectively, for lesions treated with BED <
100Gy10 (p = 0.0148 by log-rank test). This did not
translate into a significant difference in OS (p = 0.2064)
(Fig. 5b).
Stratification was then performed using only lung me-
tastases treated with BED ≥100Gy10 stratified by lesion
volume <11 cc, 11–27 cc, and ≥27 cc. Two-year LC rates
for tumors < 11 cc, 11–27 cc and > 27 cc were 82.8% and
58.9% and 68.6%, respectively (p = 0.0244 by log-rank
test; p = 0.0122 by Gehan-Breslow Wilcoxon test, Fig. 6a).
Two-year OS for patients with tumors < 11 cc, 11–27 cc
and 27 cc were 66.0 and 58.8% and 28.5%, respectively
(p = 0.008 by log-rank test; p = 0.0133 by Gehan-Breslow
Wilcoxon test, Fig. 6b).
Other factors that were evaluated during statistical
analysis included age, KPS, gender, and use of chemo-
therapy, which were all found to be not statistically sig-
nificant for LC or OS.
Discussion
This RSSearch® Patient Registry analysis represents a re-
port of a large cohort of patients treated with SBRT for lung
metastases (n = 447 patients). In comparison, another large
study includes 217 patients from a single-institutional

 prospective series and 95 patients analyzed in a single-
institution retrospective study [6, 9, 10]. A meta-analysis re-
ported by Ashworth et al. included 757 patients all with
lung cancer; however this study only included 88 patients
treated with SBRT and included metastases to all body sites
and not only lung metastases [11]. The current study in-
cludes a heterogeneous population of patients including
large sample sizes of various primary sites, tumor sizes,
doses, and patient populations from across the United
States, Germany and Australia.
The use of SBRT for lung metastases allows for high
ablative doses of radiation with the potential for ex-
tended local control and survival as shown in the
current analysis. Multiple studies since have found LC
rates of isolated or few lung metastases to be 70–100%
at 1 year [12–15]. Our LC rate compares favorably at
80.37%. The two-year weighted OS rate compiled in an
article review by Alongi et al. was 54% (range 39–84%)
[16]. In comparison, the 2-year OS rate for all patients
reported in our study compares similarly at 53.02%.
In assessing LC, most studies support using a BED of
at least 100Gy10 to have LC comparable to metastasect-
omy of pulmonary metastases [17, 18]. Doses of less
than 100 Gy10 however are still used in clinical practice
with high LC rates and minimal toxicity [13]. In our
current study, we saw a statistically significant difference
with higher LC rates in the BED ≥ 100Gy10 group, add-
ing further evidence for its use. This LC rate did not
translate into improved OS for all size lesions, but when
stratifying by metastasis volume there was a trend for
improved OS in lesions smaller than 11 cc.
In the current study, we saw differences in OS be-
tween primary histology types, favoring improved OS for
H&N, breast, and CRC but without difference in local
control by primary histology. Takeda et al. found CRC
lung oligometastases to have poorer LC than other his-
tologies (lung, H&N) [10]. These results do not corrob-
orate with our results, as oligometastatic tumors from
lung primaries fared worse in the present study com-
pared to Takeda et al. where other histologies (including
lung
primary
oligometastatic
tumors)
fared
better.
Takeda et al. was limited to a small sample size of pa-
tients with lung oligometastases (n = 44) of which half
were from colorectal cancer compared with our study
with a much larger cohort. In addition, other studies
have found no relationship between oligometastatic lung
tumors from CRC primary vs other primary oligometastatic
lung tumors on multivariate analysis (MVA) [14, 19]. Our
study also compares oligometastatic lung tumors by pri-
mary individually instead of grouping primaries together
for comparison.
Our study also found differences in LC and OS rates
based on tumor volume, with significantly higher LC
and longer OS for smaller volumes. McCammon et al.
had similar findings on univariate (UVA) and multivari-
ate (MVA) analysis, finding significant differences in
rates of LC comparing values above and below their me-
dian tumor volume (8.9 cc), but this study did not see
differences in OS [19]. In comparison, two previous
studies treated large volume metastases with SBRT, both
averaging a median volume of 41 cc per lesion treated,
and found a LC rate comparable to small volume le-
sions, again without reporting OS [20, 21].
Approximately 25% of patients undergoing metastasect-
omy have long term survival [2, 22, 23]. The remaining
patients usually see progression of their disease and devel-
opment of new metastases within 6 months of ablative
therapy [24, 25]. A greater time interval between locore-
gional disease and metastatic disease portends better
prognosis and longer disease-free survival [2, 22]. Other
factors portending to longer disease-free survival include
having fewer metastases, non-synchronous metastases,
stable disease before ablative therapies, estrogen-positive
receptor breast cancer primaries, and complete ablations

 [24–26]. Because this represents a registry for patients
treated with SBRT for lung metastases, many of these
parameters could not be evaluated.
It is difficult to properly evaluate OS using SBRT for
lung metastases in context of comparing it to metasta-
sectomy. There is an absence of phase III randomized
controlled trials, and the phase I/II trials that have been
completed have patients with widely variable clinical
characteristics [16]. Only 1 retrospective study by Yu et
al. compared SBRT to metastasectomy in 58 patients
with osteosarcoma, with OS at 40% in both groups [27].
In addition, there is a bias in selection of patients for
SBRT - they are generally judged to be inoperable due to
their medical comorbidities which could significantly
affect OS rates [16]. We did not find significant survival
differences by KPS however our dataset lacks more
rigorous comorbidity scores such as the Charlson/Deyo
score needed to provide survival for potentially operable
patients [28].
There are weaknesses to the current study including
the short median follow-up of 13 months however this
follow-up is comparable to other single institution series
[29, 30]. Our study includes no predefined treatment
planning criteria, defined individually by the participat-
ing centers, with variability in dose and fractionation.
This variability however allowed for dose response ana-
lysis due to wide ranges in dose but may have lowered
the local control and survival rates possible if more uni-
form high dose was utilized in all patients. Our study
also has the standard limitations intrinsic to registry
studies: allocation of patients is not random and data
collection is less robust than randomized clinical trials.
There are ongoing prospective trials that will hopefully an-
swer if a survival benefit is found for patients treated with
SBRT for oligometastases. Only one prospective trial from
MD Anderson reported in abstract form found a median
PFS advantage with three or less sites of oligometastases
treated with SBRT, conventional external beam radiation or
surgery for non-small cell lung cancer from 3.9 to
11.9 months (p = 0.005) [31]. In addition, other prospective
trials continue to accrue including the SABR-COMET, NRG
BR002, and the UK CORE trials. Until results of those trials
are reported, we will have to rely on prospective registry
series like the current study to guide treatment decisions.
Conclusions
SBRT provides extended survival in patients with lung
metastases, with the current study providing a 5-year ac-
tuarial survival of 21.8%. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year LC rates
were 80.4%, 58.9%, and 46.2%, respectively. Smaller
tumor size and the primary tumor type (H&N/colon/
breast) were associated with prolonged survival. High
dose BED (≥100Gy10) and smaller tumor size were asso-
ciated with prolonged local control.
