Studies have shown links between educational outcomes 
such as letter grades, test scores, or other measures of academic 
achievement, and health-related behaviors (1–4). However, 
as reported in a 2013 systematic review, many of these stud-
ies have used samples that are not nationally representative, 
and quite a few studies are now at least 2 decades old (1). 
To update the relevant data, CDC analyzed results from the 
2015 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), a biennial, 
cross-sectional, school-based survey measuring health-related 
behaviors among U.S. students in grades 9–12. Analyses 
assessed relationships between academic achievement (i.e., 
self-reported letter grades in school) and 30 health-related 
behaviors (categorized as dietary behaviors, physical activ-
ity, sedentary behaviors, substance use, sexual risk behaviors, 
violence-related behaviors, and suicide-related behaviors) that 
contribute to leading causes of morbidity and mortality among 
adolescents in the United States (5). Logistic regression models 
controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, and grade in school found 
that students who earned mostly A’s, mostly B’s, or mostly C’s 
had statistically significantly higher prevalence estimates for 
most protective health-related behaviors and significantly lower 
prevalence estimates for most health-related risk behaviors than 
did students with mostly D’s/F’s. These findings highlight the 
link between health-related behaviors and education outcomes, 
suggesting that education and public health professionals 
can find their respective education and health improvement 
goals to be mutually beneficial. Education and public health 
professionals might benefit from collaborating to achieve both 
improved education and health outcomes for youths.
The national YRBS is a biennial, school-based survey of 
U.S. high school students conducted by CDC. For the 2015 
survey, a three-stage cluster sample design was used to produce a 
nationally representative sample of students in grades 9–12 who 
attended public and private schools (6). The school response 
rate was 69%, the student response rate was 86%, and the 
overall response rate (the school response rate multiplied by the 
student response rate) was 60%. Data were weighted based on 
sex, race/ethnicity, and school grade to adjust for nonresponse 
and oversampling of black and Hispanic students. The final 
data set included data from 15,624 students in grades 9–12.
School-level parental permission procedures were followed 
before survey administration, and participation was voluntary. 
Survey procedures were designed to protect students’ privacy 
by allowing for anonymous participation. Students completed 
the self-administered questionnaire during a single class period 
and recorded their responses on a computer-scannable booklet 
or answer sheet.
Academic achievement was measured with a question on self-
reported letter grades in school: “During the past 12 months,

how would you describe your grades in school?” Students could 
select one of the following response options: mostly A’s, mostly 
B’s, mostly C’s, mostly D’s, mostly F’s, none of these grades, 
and not sure. Data from additional questions were used to 
measure five dietary behaviors, three physical activity behaviors, 
two sedentary behaviors, seven substance use behaviors, five 
sexual risk behaviors, five violence-related behaviors, and three 
suicide-related behaviors. The dietary behaviors included (for 
the 7 days before the survey): ate breakfast on all 7 days; ate 
fruit or drank 100% fruit juices one or more times per day; 
ate vegetables one or more times per day; drank one or more 
glasses of milk per day; and did not drink a can, bottle, or glass 
of soda or pop. The physical activity behaviors included being 
physically active at least 60 minutes per day on 5 or more days 
during the 7 days before the survey, played on at least one sports 
team during the 12 months before the survey, and attended 
physical education classes on 1 or more days in an average week 
when they were in school. The sedentary behaviors included 
having watched television 3 or more hours per day on an aver-
age school day, and played video or computer games or used a 
computer for something that was not school work 3 or more 
hours per day on an average school day.
The substance use behaviors included current alcohol use 
(on at least 1 day during the 30 days before the survey); current 
marijuana use (one or more times during the 30 days before 
the survey); ever use of cocaine, ever use of heroin, ever use of 
methamphetamines, ever injection of any illegal drug, and ever 
took prescription drugs without a doctor’s prescription. The 
sexual risk behaviors included ever had sexual intercourse, had 
sexual intercourse with four or more persons, currently sexually 
active (had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the 
survey), did not use a condom during last sexual intercourse, and 
did not use any method to prevent pregnancy during last sexual 
intercourse. The violence-related behaviors included having 
experienced, during the 12 months before the survey, physical 
violence by someone they were dating or going out with, sexual 
violence by someone they were dating or going out with, being 
bullied on school property, and being electronically bullied, 
and, during the 30 days before the survey, not going to school 
because of safety concerns. Finally, the suicide-related behaviors 
included having, during the 12 months before the survey, seri-
ously considered attempting suicide, made a plan about how they 
would attempt suicide, and attempted suicide. Four additional 
questions on sex, race, ethnicity, and grade in school were used 
to create control variables for the statistical analyses.
Unadjusted prevalence estimates were calculated. Logistic 
regression models were used to determine whether the categori-
cal variable of self-reported grades in school was associated with 
each health-related behavior while controlling for sex, race/
ethnicity, and grade (9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th). Wald F p-values 
from the logistic regressions were used to determine statisti-
cally significant associations between overall self-reported letter 
grades in school and each behavior with an alpha level of 0.05. 
Comparisons of students with specific self-reported grades 
(mostly A’s, mostly B’s, or mostly C’s) against a combined ref-
erent group of students with mostly D’s/F’s were also assessed.

Unadjusted percentages showed a general gradient of associa-
tion between self-reported letter grades and health behaviors 
(Table 1). After adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, and grade level, 
overall self-reported grades in school were significantly associ-
ated with each behavior (p<0.05), except for physical education 
attendance (p = 0.6416) (Table 2). Students with mostly A’s, 
mostly B’s, or mostly C’s had significantly higher prevalence 
estimates for most protective health-related behaviors and 
significantly lower prevalence estimates for most health-related 
risk behaviors, including all substance use, sexual risk, violence-
related, and suicide-related behaviors (Table 2). Prevalence 
estimates for students with mostly C’s were not significantly 
different from those for students with mostly D’s/F’s for two 
behaviors: ate vegetables one or more times per day during the 
past 7 days and watched television 3 or more hours per day on 
an average school day.
Discussion
Among U.S. high school students, healthy eating and 
physical activity were associated with higher self-reported letter 
grades, whereas sedentary, substance-use, sexual risk, violence-
related, and suicide-related behaviors were associated with 
lower self-reported grades. This relationship, which appears 
similar for both lifetime and more recent behaviors (i.e., 
behaviors that occurred one or more times during a student’s 
life and behaviors that occurred during the previous 7 days, 
30 days, 3 months, or 12 months), is consistent with findings 
of other reports (1–4,7). A 2013 systematic review examining

25 years of evidence related to academic achievement and 
health-related behaviors across a wide range of ages and grade 
levels found that 96.8% of reviewed cross-sectional studies and 
93.1% of longitudinal studies identified statistically significant 
associations between some form of academic achievement and 
behaviors related to physical activity, nutrition, substance use, 
sexual risk, or violence (1). With no assessment of self-reported 
academic performance on YRBS since 2009, this report of 
2015 data from a nationwide sample of high school students 
supports earlier findings and offers updated, nationally rep-
resentative findings as evidence of a continuing association 
between health-related behaviors and academic achievement.
Although causation cannot be inferred from the current 
analysis, causal relationships are believed to exist in both 
directions between education and health (1,8). Longitudinal 
studies in the 2013 literature review concluded that less 
engagement in health risk behaviors among persons aged 
10–18 years leads to higher achievement later in life, and 
that earlier academic achievement during the same period 
leads to less health risk behaviors later in life (1). Education 
is commonly viewed as an important social determinant of 
health, leading some health professionals to measure and 
target education-related outcomes in health-focused pro-
gramming (2,7). Conversely, some educational researchers 
have advocated addressing health risk behaviors and related 
disparities as a key approach to closing academic achievement 
gaps among youths (9).
Highlighting the association between education and health 
might facilitate the establishment of partnerships between 
health agencies and education agencies, many of which are 
well positioned to support health programs, in part because 
of existing infrastructure to support educational interventions, 
health services, and family and community involvement. U.S. 
high schools enroll approximately 16.5 million youths,* and 
schools provide the physical and social environment in which 
youths spend much of their day at a key phase of life when 
many youths engage in risk behaviors. Schools face tremendous 
pressure to reach educational goals. These findings, combined

with existing evidence that improved academic achievement 
outcomes can be seen from health programs based on the coor-
dinated school health or Whole School, Whole Community, 
Whole Child models, suggest that efforts to improve health 
among students might contribute to achievement of those 
educational goals (7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, because data analyzed in this report are 
cross-sectional, findings show only associations and cannot 
demonstrate causality in either direction.  Second, this study 
does not address potential confounding (e.g., the extent to 
which both health behaviors and educational outcomes might 
result from other factors such as family context and neigh-
borhood setting). However, several studies included in the 
2013 review found that the association between health-related 
behaviors and education outcomes can be seen even when 
accounting for family and community contextual variables 
(1). Third, these data represent only youths who attend 
school and are not representative of all youths in this age 
group. Data from 2012 indicated that approximately 2.9% of 
youths aged 16 and 17 years in the United States had dropped 
out of high school†; such youths are not represented in this 
report. Finally, CDC cannot determine the extent to which 
respondents might overreport or underreport behaviors or 
grades in school; however, YRBS questions have demonstrated 
good test-retest reliability (6).
School health interventions can promote positive health 
behaviors by 1) offering students opportunities to practice 
healthy behaviors; 2) increasing student knowledge and skills

education, and comprehensive health education (including 
sexual health education); 3) enhancing protective factors such 
as school connectedness or parent engagement; and 4) shap-
ing school health services and environments more broadly 
(9,10). School health programs based on the Whole School, 
Whole Community, Whole Child or coordinated school 
health models (https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/wscc/) 
that include safe, supportive environments and engagement 
from communities and families as key components, have 
been linked to improved academic achievement outcomes 
among students (2,7). Such evidence suggests that educa-
tion and public health professionals have a shared interest 
in promoting student health and that collaborative efforts 
have the potential to make important strides in improving 
the health and academic achievement of youths.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Studies have shown links between health-related behaviors and 
educational outcomes such as grades, test scores, and other 
measures of academic achievement; however, many of these 
studies have used samples that are not nationally representa-
tive or are out of date.
What is added by this report?
Analyses of nationwide 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey data 
(controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, and grade in school) reveal 
that high school students who received mostly A’s, mostly B’s, or 
mostly C’s had significantly higher prevalence estimates for 
most protective health-related behaviors and significantly lower 
prevalence estimates for most health-related risk behaviors 
compared with students with mostly D’s/F’s.
What are the implications for public health practice?
School health interventions can promote positive health 
behaviors and improve both health and academic outcomes for 
students. Evidence suggests that educational and public health 
institutions have a shared interest in promoting student health 
and that collaborative efforts have the potential to make 
important strides in improving the health and academic 
achievement of youths.
