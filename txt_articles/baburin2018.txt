Evodiae
 fructus
 is
 a widely  used
 herbal
 drug  in  traditional
 Chinese
 medicine.
 Evodia  extract
 was
 found
to
 inhibit  hERG  channels.
 The
 aim  of  the  current  study  was  to identify
 hERG  inhibitors  in
 Evodia
 extract
and  to  investigate
 their  potential
 proarrhythmic
 effects.  Dehydroevodiamine
 (DHE)
 and  hortiamine
 were
identified
 as
 IKr (rapid  delayed
 rectifier  current)  inhibitors
 in  Evodia
 extract  by  HPLC-microfractionation
and
 subsequent
 patch  clamp  studies  on  human
 embryonic
 kidney
 cells.  DHE  and  hortiamine
 inhibited
 IKr
with  IC50s of  253.2  ±
 26.3  nM
 and 144.8  ±  35.1  nM,  respectively.
 In dog  ventricular
 cardiomyocytes,
 DHE
dose-dependently
 prolonged
 the  action
 potential
 duration
 (APD).
 Early  afterdepolarizations
 (EADs)  were
seen
 in  14,  67, 100,  and 67%  of  cells  after  0.01,  0.1,  1
 and 10  �M DHE,  respectively.
 The  proarrhythmic
potential
 of DHE  was  evaluated
 in  8 anesthetized
 rabbits  and  in  8 chronic
 atrioventricular
 block  (cAVB)
dogs.
 In  rabbits,
 DHE  increased
 the QT  interval
 significantly
 by  12 ±
 10%  (0.05  mg/kg/5  min)  and
 60
 ±  26%
(0.5
 mg/kg/5
 min),  and  induced
 Torsade
 de  Pointes
 arrhythmias
 (TdP,  0.5  mg/kg/5  min)  in  2  rabbits.
 In
cAVB
 dogs,  0.33  mg/kg/5
 min  DHE  increased
 QT  duration
 by  48  ±
 10%  (P  <  0.05*)  and  induced
 TdP  in  2/4
dogs.
 A  higher  dose  did  not  induce
 TdP.  In human
 induced
 pluripotent
 stem
 cell-derived
 cardiomyocytes
(hiPSC-CMs),
 methanolic
 extracts
 of  Evodia,
 DHE  and  hortiamine
 dose-dependently
 prolonged
 APD.  At
3
 �M  DHE  and  hortiamine
 induced
 EADs.
hERG
 inhibition
 at submicromolar
 concentrations,
 APD  prolongation
 and  EADs
 in hiPSC-CMs
 and  dose-
dependent
 proarrhythmic
 effects  of  DHE  at  micromolar
 plasma
 concentrations
 in  cAVB  dogs  should
increase
 awareness
 regarding
 proarrhythmic
 effects  of  widely  used
 Evodia  extracts.

 Introduction
Herbal
 drugs
 are
 one
 of
 the
 cornerstones
 of
 traditional
 Chinese
medicine
 (TCM).
 Wu
 Zhu
 Yu,
 the
 dried
 and
 nearly
 ripe
 fruit
 of
 Evo-
dia
 rutaecarpa,  is
 among
 the
 most
 popular
 and
 widely
 used
 herbal
drugs
 in
 TCM.
 It
 is
 used
 as
 an
 analgesic,
 anti-emetic,
 for
 treatment
of
 headache,
 gastrointestinal
 disorders,
 and
 menstrual
 complaints,
or
 by
 means
 of
 external
 application
 against
 mouth
 ulcers
 [1].
 How-
ever,
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 elaborate
 preclinical
 safety
 evaluations
 [2,3]

to
 which
 new
 drug
 molecules
 are
 subjected,
 herbal
 drugs
 are
 con-
sidered
 as
 safe
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 empirical
 knowledge
 from
 use
 over
centuries.
 This
 may
 be
 an
 issue,
 in
 particular,
 with
 herbal
 drugs
 con-
taining
 pharmacologically
 potent
 molecules,
 such
 as
 is
 the
 case
 for
some
 TCM
 herbs.
 Use
 of
 some
 TCM
 herbal
 preparations
 have
 been
associated
 with
 severe
 side
 effects,
 and
 even
 deaths
 due
 to
 organ
failure,
 as
 was
 the
 case
 with
 a
 slimming
 product
 containing
 Aris-
tolochia
 fanchi,
 an
 herbal
 drug
 with
 meanwhile
 well-understood
nephrotoxic
 liabilities
 [4].
DHE
 is
 the
 major
 alkaloid
 of
 Evodia
 rutaecarpa,
 and
 is
 known
 to
have
 cardiovascular
 effects.
 DHE
 causes
 bradycardia,
 hypotension,
and
 vasorelaxation
 [5–7].
 More
 detailed
 electrophysiological
 stud-
ies
 revealed
 interference
 with
 pacemaker
 activity
 and
 with
 several
ion
 currents
 in
 the
 heart.
 In
 pacemaker
 cells
 from
 rabbit
 sinoatrial
tissue,
 diastolic
 depolarization
 was
 inhibited,
 and
 the
 spontaneous
cycle
 length
 increased
 [8].
 Furthermore,
 DHE
 increased
 the
 APD
 in
these
 cells,
 an
 effect
 that
 was
 also
 shown
 in
 rabbit
 papillary
 mus-
cle,
 and
 in
 isolated
 guinea
 pig
 atrial
 and
 ventricular
 cardiomyocytes
[8,9].
 In
 isolated
 guinea
 pig
 cardiomyocytes,
 DHE
 (0.1
 �M)
 inhibited
outward
 potassium
 currents
 (delayed
 rectifier)
 by
 50%,
 and
 higher
concentrations
 resulted
 in
 additional
 blockage
 of
 inward
 calcium
and
 sodium
 currents
 [9].
 It
 is
 currently
 not
 known
 whether
 inhi-
bition
 of
 hERG
 (human
 Ether-a-go-go
 Related
 Gene)
 contributes
 to
DHE-induced
 prolongation
 of
 the
 cardiac
 APD.
hERG
 encodes
 the
 �-subunit
 of
 the
 rapid
 delayed
 rectifier
 K+
channel
 which
 can
 be
 mainly
 found
 in
 human
 myocardium,
 where
it
 plays
 a
 central
 role
 in
 the
 repolarization
 phase
 of
 the
 car-
diac
 action
 potential
 [10–12].
 Inhibition
 of
 repolarizing
 outward
potassium
 currents
 (especially
 hERG
 channel
 inhibition)
 and
 APD
prolongation
 are
 considered
 as
 risk
 factors
 for
 TdP,
 even
 though
the
 relation
 between
 the
 factors
 is
 not
 very
 strong
 [13].
 There-
fore,
 investigation
 of
 possible
 effects
 on
 the
 surface
 ECG,
 and
 direct
determination
 of
 proarrhythmic
 potential
 in
 suitable
 large
 animal
models
 is
 recommended.
 We  here
 identified
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
as
 potent
 hERG
 channel
 inhibitors
 in
 Evodia
 extracts.
 The
 effects
of
 DHE
 (the
 major
 alkaloid
 in
 Evodia)  on
 APD
 were
 evaluated
 in
isolated
 cardiomyocytes
 from
 cAVB
 dogs.
 Anesthetized
 rabbits
 and
cAVB
 dogs
 were
 used
 to
 evaluate
 whether
 the
 ion
 blocking
 actions
of
 DHE
 indeed
 translate
 to
 QT
 prolongation
 and
 proarrhythmia
 in
vivo.
 Additionally,
 proarrhythmic
 effects
 of
 Evodia
 extracts,
 DHE
and
 hortiamine
 on
 APD
 were
 studied
 in
 hiPSC-CMs.

 and
 NaV1.5
 channels
 (ChanPharm

were
 cultured
 and
 harvested
 as
 previously
 described
 [14,15].
 Cur-
rents
 through
 hERG
 and
 NaV1.5
 channels
 stably
 expressed
 in
 HEK
293
 cells
 were
 studied
 within
 8
 h
 of
 harvest
 in
 the
 whole-cell
 config-
uration
 of
 the
 planar
 patch
 clamp
 technique
 (NPC-16
 Patchliner
®,

 [16,17]
 making
use
 of
 an
 EPC
 10
 patch
 clamp
 amplifier
 (HEKA,
 Lambrecht/Pfalz,
Germany).
 Currents
 were
 low-pass
 filtered
 at
 10
 kHz
 using
 the
internal
 Bessel
 filter
 of
 the
 EPC-10
 and
 sampled
 at
 25
 kHz.
 The
extracellular
 bath
 solution
 for
 hERG
 current
 recordings
 contained
(in
 mM):
 NaCl
 140,
 KCl
 4,
 CaCl2 2,
 MgCl2 1,
 D-Glucose*H2O
 5
 and
HEPES
 10
 (pH
 7.4
 with
 NaOH).
 The
 intracellular
 solution
 for
 hERG
current
 recordings
 contained
 (in
 mM):
 KCl
 50,
 NaCl
 10,
 KF
 60,
 EGTA
20
 and
 HEPES
 10
 (pH
 7.2

 solution
for
 sodium
 current
 recordings
 contained
 (in
 mM):
 NaCl
 20,
 KCl
 4,
CaCl2 1.8,
 MgCl2 0.75,
 choline
 chloride
 120
 and
 HEPES
 5
 (pH

with
 NaOH).
 The
 intracellular
 solution
 for
 sodium
 current
 record-
ings
 contained
 (in
 mM):
 CsF
 120,
 CsCl
 20,
 EGTA
 5
 and
 HEPES
 5
(pH
 7.4
 with
 CsOH).
 NPC-16
 Patchliner
® was
 used
 for
 drug
 appli-
cations.
 The
 PatchMaster
 software
 v.2.65
 (HEKA,
 Lambrecht/Pfalz,
Germany)
 was
 used
 for
 data
 acquisition.
 The
 voltage
 protocol
 for
hERG
 current
 recordings
 (see
 inset
 in
 Fig.
 1C)
 was
 designed
 to
 simu-
late
 voltage
 changes
 during
 a
 cardiac
 action
 potential
 with
 a
 300
 ms
depolarization
 to
 +20
 mV  (analogous
 to
 the
 plateau
 phase
 of
 the
cardiac
 action
 potential),
 a
 repolarization
 for
 300
 ms
 to
 −50
 mV
(inducing
 a
 tail
 current)
 and
 a
 final
 step
 to
 the
 holding
 potential
of
 −100
 mV.
 The
 decreases
 in
 the
 resulting
 tail
 current
 amplitudes
were
 taken
 as
 a
 measure
 of
 block
 development
 during
 a
 pulse
train.
 Sodium
 currents
 were
 recorded
 in
 response
 to
 10
 ms
 pulses
(0.2
 Hz)
 from
 a
 holding
 potential
 of
 −120
 mV to
 0
 mV,
 and
 the
NaV1.5
 channel
 block
 was
 estimated
 as
 the
 decrease
 in
 the
 peak
current
 amplitude
 during
 a
 pulse
 train.
For
 barium
 current
 measurements
 through
 CaV1.2
 channels,
HEK
 293
 cells
 were
 transfected
 and
 cultured
 as
 previously
described
 [18].
 Barium
 currents
 through
 CaV1.2
 channels
 tran-
siently
 expressed
 in
 HEK
 293
 cells
 were
 studied
 36–48
 h
 after
transfection
 by
 manual
 patch
 clamp
 technique
 making
 use
 of
 an
Axopatch
 200A
 patch
 clamp
 amplifier
 (Molecular
 Devices,
 Inc.,
 Sun-
nyvale,
 CA,
 USA).
 Currents
 were
 filtered
 at
 5
 kHz
 and
 sampled
 at
10
 kHz.
 The
 extracellular
 bath
 solution
 for
 IBa recordings
 contained
(in
 mM):
 BaCl2 20,
 MgCl2 1,
 choline
 chloride
 90
 and
 HEPES
 10
 (pH
7.4
 with
 methanesulfonic
 acid).
 Patch
 pipettes
 with
 resistances
 of
1–4
 M�
 were
 made
 from
 borosilicate
 glass
 (Harvard
 Apparatus,
Cambridge,
 UK)
 and
 filled
 with
 intracellular
 solution
 that
 contained
(in
 mM):
 CsCl
 145,
 MgCl2 3,
 EGTA
 10
 and
 HEPES
 10
 (pH
 7.25
 with
CsOH).
 Drugs
 were
 applied
 to
 cells
 under
 voltage
 clamp
 using
 a
microminifold
 perfusion
 system.
 The
 pClamp
 software
 package
v.10.0
 (Molecular
 Devices,
 Inc.,
 Sunnyvale,
 CA,
 USA)
 was
 used
 for
data
 acquisition.
 Barium
 currents
 were
 recorded
 in
 response
 to
50
 ms
 pulses
 (0.2
 Hz)
 from
 a
 holding
 potential
 of
 −80
 mV to
 +10
 mV,
and
 the
 CaV1.2
 channel
 block
 was
 estimated
 as
 the
 decrease
 in
 the
peak
 current
 amplitude
 during
 a
 pulse
 train.

 Patch
 clamp
 and
 voltage
 clamp
 data
 analysis
Origin
 software
 v.7.0
 (OriginLab
 Corp.,
 Northampton,
 MA,
 USA)
was
 employed
 for
 analysis
 and
 curve
 fitting.
 The
 cumulative
concentration-inhibition
 curves
 were
 fitted
 using
 the
 Hill
 equation:
IhERG,drug/IhERG,control =
 (100
 −
 A)/(1
 +
 (C/IC50) nH)
 +
 A
 in
 which
 IC50 is
the
 concentration
 at
 which
 hERG
 inhibition
 is
 half-maximal,
 C
 is
the
 applied
 drug
 concentration,
 A
 is
 the
 fraction
 of
 hERG
 current
that
 is
 not
 blocked,
 and
 nH is
 the
 Hill
 coefficient
 [19].
2.1.4.
 Docking
 and
 MD
 (molecular
 dynamics)
 simulations
Coordinates
 of
 the
 identified
 hERG
 blockers
 were
 generated
with
 Gaussview
 5
 (Gaussian,
 Inc.,
 Wallingford,
 CT,
 USA).
 The
 thor-
oughly
 validated
 homology
 model
 of
 the
 open
 hERG
 pore
 (model
 6
of
 Stary
 et
 al.
 [20])
 was
 used
 as
 starting
 point
 for
 docking
 analyses.
Docking
 was
 performed
 with
 the
 program
 GOLD
 v5.2
 (Cambridge
Crystallographic
 Data
 Centre,
 Cambridge,
 U.K.)
 using
 the
 GOLD
scoring
 function.
 The
 coordinates
 of
 the
 geometric
 center
 calcu-
lated
 among
 the
 Y652
 and
 F656
 residues
 were
 taken
 as
 binding
site
 origin
 and
 both
 side
 chains
 were
 treated
 as
 flexible.
 The
 mod-
eling
 software
 Pymol
 (Molecular

 was
 used
 to
 visualize
 and
 examine
 the
 interac-
tions
 of
 DHE
 with
 the
 hERG
 cavity.
 The
 most
 frequent
 binding

 White
 rabbits
 (2.7–4.3
 kg)
were
 used.
 The
 animals
 were
 prepared
 and
 instrumented
 as

 [29].
 In
 short,
 anesthesia
 was
 induced
 with
i.m.
 ketamine
 (35

 and
 xylazine
 (5
 mg/kg),
 and
 then
maintained
 with
 inhaled

2.2.3.
 In
 vivo
 experiments
 –
 cAVB
 dogs
Eight
 adult
 mongrel
 dogs
 (20–25
 kg)
 were
 included
 in
 the
 study.
The
 cAVB
 dog
 model
 was
 implemented
 as
 described
 earlier
 [31].
 In
short,
 the
 dogs
 were
 sedated
 with
 10
 mg
 methadone,
 10
 mg
 ace-
promazine
 and
 0.5
 mg  atropine
 (i.m.).
 Hereafter,
 general
 anesthesia
was
 induced
 by
 an
 intravenous
 bolus
 injection
 of
 25
 mg/kg
 sodium
pentobarbital,
 anesthesia
 was
 maintained
 by
 inhaled
 isoflurane
1.5%
 in
 N2O/O2 (1:2).
 A
 screw-in
 transvenous
 pacemaker
 lead
 was
advanced
 via
 the
 right
 jugular
 vein
 to
 the
 right
 ventricular
 apex
and
 connected
 to
 an
 internal
 pacemaker
 (Medtronic,
 Maastricht,
the
 Netherlands),
 subsequently,
 AV
 block
 was
 created
 by
 radiofre-
quency
 ablation.
After
 a
 baseline
 period
 of
 10
 min
 during
 which
 control
values
 were
 obtained,
 cAVB
 dogs
 were
 treated
 with
 either

 In
 sepa-
rate
 experiments
 all
 dogs
 were
 serially
 challenged
 with
 dofetilide
(25
 �g/kg)
 to
 confirm
 individual

 susceptibility.
 When
TdP
 arrhythmias
 occurred
 and
 lasted
 more
 than
 10–15
 s,
 electrical
cardioversion
 was
 applied
 via
 thoracic
 paces.
2.2.4.
 Analysis
 of
 in
 vivo
 experiments
All
 experiments
 were
 performed
 in
 chronic
 AV
 block
 condi-
tions,
 at
 least
 3
 weeks
 after
 creation
 of
 AV
 block,
 once
 electrical
remodelling
 is
 complete
 [32].
 General
 anesthesia
 was
 induced
according
 to
 the
 aforementioned
 protocol,
 hereafter;
 catheters
were
 advanced
 to
 RV
 and
 LV
 (the
 right
 and
 left
 ventricle)
 respec-
tively
 in
 order
 to
 record
 MAP
 (monophasic
 action
 potentials)
 from
the
 endocardium
 of
 the
 ventricular
 wall.
 During
 all
 animal
 experi-
ments
 standard
 6
 leads
 ECG
 with
 4
 precordial
 leads
 and
 endocardial
LV
 and
 RV
 MAP
 (precordial
 ECG
 leads
 and
 RVMAP
 only
 in
 cAVB
dogs)
 were
 recorded
 and
 stored
 continuously
 (EPtracer
 sampling
rate
 1
 kHz,
 Cardiotek,
 Maastricht,
 the
 Netherlands).
 Recorded
 ECG
data
 was
 analyzed
 off
 line
 using
 the
 EPTracer
 program.
 RR,
 QT,
 PR,
and
 QRS
 intervals
 were
 measured
 manually
 at
 baseline,
 directly
after
 drug
 infusion,
 and
 every
 10
 min
 during
 the
 observation
 peri-
ods.
 For
 each
 time
 point,
 the
 displayed
 intervals
 represent
 the
average
 of
 5
 beats
 (in
 rabbits
 of
 sinoatrial
 origin)
 from
 the
 lead
that
 provided
 the
 clearest
 signal
 (mainly
 lead
 II).
 Monophasic
action
 potential
 signals
 were
 measured
 semi
 automatically
 using
Matlab
 (Mathworks,
 Natick,
 USA),
 values
 are
 displayed
 at
 80%
 repo-
larization
 and
 represent
 the
 mean
 of
 30
 s
 recordings
 [33].
 The
proarrhythmic
 marker
 BVR
 was
 quantified
 as
 STV
 from
 LVMAPD80
as
 described
 previously
 [30].
 Note
 that
 at
 some
 preset
 time
 points,
ECG
 intervals
 could
 not
 be
 obtained
 from
 all
 animals
 because
 of
arrhythmias,
 ectopic
 beats
 (EB),
 or
 conduction
 disturbances,
 indi-
cated
 as
 not
 measurable
 (nm).
 The
 occurrence
 of
 single
 and
 multiple
(<4)
 EB’s
 and
 number
 of
 TdP
 arrhythmias
 were
 scored.
 TdP
 was
defined
 as
 a
 polymorphic
 ventricular
 tachyarrhythmia
 with
 at
 least
5
 consecutive
 undulating
 QRS
 complexes
 with
 a
 typical
 twisting
around
 the
 isoelectric
 line
 of
 the
 ECG.
 Animals
 were
 considered
inducible
 if
 3
 or
 more
 TdP
 episodes
 occurred
 in
 the
 10
 min
 obser-
vation
 period.
2.3.
 Optical
 action
 potential
 measurements
 in
 hiPSC-CMs
Cor.4U
® hiPSC-CMs
 (Ncardia,
 Cologne,
 Germany)
 were
 incu-
bated
 at
 37 ◦C,
 5%
 CO2 in
 Cor.4U
® complete
 human
 cardiomyocyte
culture
 medium.
 Before
 the
 experiments,
 the
 cells
 were
 transiently
loaded
 with
 the
 voltage-sensitive
 dye
 (VSD)
 FluoVolt
 (x0.25,
 for
30
 min
 at
 room
 temperature).
 Afterwards,
 the
 medium
 contain-
ing
 VSD
 was
 replaced
 by
 fresh
 serum-free
 medium
 (DMEM,
 Sigma
Aldrich,
 Vienna,
 Austria).
 The
 multi-well
 plate
 was
 placed
 in
 an
environmentally
 controlled
 stage
 incubator
 (37 ◦C,
 5%
 CO2,
 water-
saturated
 air
 atmosphere)
 (Okolab
 Inc,
 Burlingame,

 USA).
 The
FluoVolt
 fluorescence
 signal
 was
 recorded
 from
 a
 0.2
 ×
 0.2
 mm
area
 using
 a
 40
 ×
 (NA

 objective
 lens.
 Excitation
 wavelength
was
 470
 ±

 using
 a
 light-emitting
 diode
 (LED),
 and
 emitted
light
 was
 collected
 by

 (PMT)
 at
 510–560
 and.
 LED,
PMT,
 associated
 power
 supplies
 and
 amplifiers
 were
 supplied
 by
Cairn
 Research
 Ltd
 (Kent,

 Fluorescence
 signal
 was
 digitized
 at
10
 kHz.
 Acute
 effects
 of
 drugs
 were
 assessed
 by
 exposure
 to
 stud-
ied
 drug
 concentration
 with
 matched
 vehicle
 controls
 (DMSO).
 A
20
 s
 recording
 was
 then
 taken
 5
 min
 after
 exposure
 to
 the
 drug
or
 vehicle
 with
 only
 one
 concentration
 applied
 per
 well.
 The
 pro-
cedure
 was
 repeated
 five
 times.
 The
 records
 were
 subsequently
analyzed
 offline
 using
 the
 pClamp
 software
 package
 v.10.0
 (Molec-
ular
 Devices,

 APD
 was
 measured
 at
 90%
repolarization.

 Results
3.1.
 Initial
 finding
To
 assess
 the
 risk
 of
 hERG
 channel
 inhibition
 by
 medicinal
plants,
 we
 screened
 a
 library
 of
 extracts
 prepared
 from
 major
 herbal
drugs
 of
 the
 European
 and
 Chinese
 Pharmacopoeias.
 A
 methano-
lic
 extract
 of
 Evodia
 rutaecarpa
 was
 found
 to
 induce
 strong
 hERG
channel
 inhibition.
 Application
 of
 100
 �g/mL
 extract
 to
 HEK
 293
cells
 stably
 expressing
 hERG
 channels
 induced
 85.2
 ±
 0.5%
 (n
 =
 4)
inhibition
 of
 the
 potassium
 current.
The
 
active
 
(hERG
 
blocking)
 
compounds
 
were
 
tracked
with
 
an
 
established
 
profiling
 
approach
 
combining
 
HPLC-
microfractionation
 
and
 
in
 
vitro
 
bioactivity
 
testing
 
[13,34].
Microfractions

 14
 and
 15
 inhibited

 current
by
 77.0
 ±
 13.6%
 (n

 87.3
 ±
 3.1%
 (n
 =
 6)
 and
 87.8
 ±
 6.8%
 (n
 =
 3),
respectively
 (black
 bars
 in
 Fig.
 1A).
 Subsequent
 analysis
 revealed
that
 the
 hERG
 channel
 inhibitory
 activity
 of
 crude
 Evodia
 extract
was
 attributable
 to
 DHE
 (1)
 and
 hortiamine
 (3)
 (see
 Fig.
 1B).
The
 effect
 of
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 on
 hERG
 channels
 was
 inves-
tigated
 in
 HEK
 cells
 stably
 expressing
 hERG
 channels.

3.2.
 Binding
 modes
 of
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
To
 gain
 insight
 into
 the
 molecular
 mechanism
 of
 hERG
 channel
inhibition
 by
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine,
 their
 potential
 interaction
 with
key
 amino
 acids
 known
 to
 interact
 with
 hERG
 blockers
 [35]
 was
analyzed.
 For
 these
 experiments
 we
 made
 use
 of
 mutations
 Y652A
and
 F656A
 that
 are
 known
 to
 reduce
 the
 sensitivity
 of
 hERG
 to
 most
hERG
 inhibitors
 [36].
 The
 steady-state
 block
 by
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
at
 300
 �M
 concentrations
 of
 hERG
 channels
 expressed
 in
 Xenopus
oocytes
 was
 significantly
 reduced
 for
 both
 mutants
 compared
 to
wild
 type
 (WT,
 see
 Fig.
 2)
 [36,37].
A
 molecular
 docking
 approach
 was
 used
 to
 investigate
 the
structural
 interactions
 of
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine,
 whereby
 an
 open
conformation
 homology
 model
 of
 the
 hERG
 channel
 was
 used.
 The
predicted
 binding
 modes
 for
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 are
 shown
 in
Fig.
 3.
Docking
 suggests
 that
 DHE
 binds
 to
 the
 central
 cavity
 of
 hERG
and
 forms
 hydrophobic
 interactions
 with
 Y652
 and
 �-
 �-stacking
interactions
 with
 the
 aromatic
 rings
 of
 F656
 in
 segment
 S6.
 This
binding
 mode
 is
 highly
 consistent
 with
 experimental
 results
 (see
Fig.
 2),
 and
 in
 agreement
 with
 previous
 studies
 on
 various
 hERG
blockers
 [39].
 MD  simulations
 were
 performed
 to
 assess
 the
dynamic
 interactions
 of
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 with
 the
 hERG
 chan-
nel.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3C,D
 the
 majority
 of
 contacts
 remained
 the
same
 as
 described
 for
 the
 original
 docking.
 To
 analyze
 the
 inter-
actions
 of
 the
 ligands
 with
 the
 identified
 binding
 determinants,
distances
 of
 the
 aromatic
 rings
 of
 ligands
 (indole
 and
 ketoquinazo-
line)
 and
 Y652/F656
 were
 measured.
 Both
 aromatic
 rings
 showed
distances
 to
 the
 amino
 acids
 between
 0.35
 and
 0.5
 nm
 over
 time.
This
 range
 has
 been
 described
 as
 an
 important
 characteristic
 of
 �-�
stacking
 interactions
 [38].
 Visual
 inspection
 after
 40
 ns
 MD  simula-
tions
 showed
 that
 the
 indole
 ring
 of
 DHE
 was
 able
 to
 arrange
 itself
between
 Y652
 and
 F656
 in
 a
 sandwich
 type
 manner,
 thereby
 allow-
ing
 �-�
 stacking
 interactions
 with
 both
 amino
 acids
 (Fig.
 3A).
 These
binding
 interactions
 exhibited
 high
 stability
 as
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3C.
After
 a
 short
 rearrangement
 of
 DHE
 of
 6
 ns
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
simulation,
 the
 distance
 of
 the
 indole
 ring
 to
 Y652
 and
 F656
 was
reduced
 to
 0.4
 nm,
 indicating
 that
 �-�
 stacking
 interactions
 can
occur.
 Close
 proximity
 of
 the
 aromatic
 rings
 was
 observed
 for
 the
rest
 of
 the
 simulation.
 In
 the
 hortiamine
 simulation
 comparable
�-�
 stacking
 interactions
 were
 observed.
3.3.
 DHE
 in
 isolated
 cAVB
 dog
 cardiomyocytes
DHE
 prolonged
 APD
 in
 cAVB
 cells
 at
 0.01
 and
 1
 �M
 in
a
 concentration-dependent
 manner.
 At
 higher
 concentrations
(10
 �M),
 APD
 prolongation
 was
 less
 severe,
 and
 the
 statistical
 sig-
nificance
 compared
 to
 baseline
 values
 was
 lost,
 producing
 a
 bell
shaped
 curve
 (Fig.
 4A,B,
 Table
 1).
The
 increase
 in
 STV
 and
 the
 incidence
 of
 EADs
 were
 also
concentration-dependent.
 While
 the
 lowest
 concentration
 of
0.01
 �M
 DHE
 induced
 EAD
 in
 14%
 of
 cells,
 EAD
 incidence
 increased
to
 100%
 after
 application
 of
 1
 �M,
 and
 decreased
 to
 67%
 after
 10
 �M
DHE
 (Fig.
 4C,
 Table
 1).
 APD
 prolongation,
 STV
 increase,
 and
 EAD
incidence
 were
 somewhat
 lower
 after
 dofetilide,
 a
 compound
 that
reliably
 induces
 EAD’s
 in
 cAVB
 cells
 (Table
 1).
3.4.
 DHE
 in
 the
 anesthetized
 rabbit
DHE
 dose
 dependently
 affected
 heart
 rate,
 repolarization,
 and
conduction.
 The
 low
 dose
 of
 0.05
 mg/kg
 significantly
 increased
the
 RR
 interval
 and
 all
 repolarization
 parameters
 (QT
 166
 ±
 19
 to
185
 ±
 21*
 ms,
 LVMAPD80
 115
 ±
 12
 to
 132
 ±
 20*
 ms),
 while
 conduc-
tion
 parameters
 (PQ
 and
 QRS)
 remained
 unaffected
 (Table
 2
 upper
panels).
 Administration
 of
 the
 high
 dose
 of
 0.5
 mg/kg
 25
 min
 later
(when
 all
 parameters
 were
 back
 to
 baseline
 values;
 Table
 2
 lower
panels,
 see
 control
 (2)
 values),
 increased
 PQ
 significantly
 (69
 ±
 6
 ms
to
 75
 ±
 5*
 ms),
 and
 all
 repolarization
 parameters
 increased
 further
(QT
 169
 ±
 21
 to
 272
 ±
 63*
 ms,
 LVMAPD80
 122
 ±
 15
 to
 213
 ±
 40*
 ms,
both
 P
 <
 0.05
 vs
 low
 dose).
 The
 latter
 culminated
 in
 the
 induction
 of
single
 ectopic
 beats
 (SEB’s)
 (n
 =
 4),
 multiple
 ectopic
 beats
 (MEB’s)
(n
 =
 2),
 and
 eventually
 in
 multiple
 episodes
 of
 TdP
 in
 2/8
 rabbits.
 In
accordance,
 STV
 values
 increased
 significantly
 beyond
 the
 values
observed
 after
 the
 low
 dose
 of
 DHE
 (Table
 2).
In
 the
 second
 group
 of
 rabbits,
 the
 class
 III
 agent
 dofetilide
(0.004
 mg/kg)
 increased
 repolarization
 to
 a
 similar
 extent
 as
0.5
 mg/kg
 DHE,
 but
 no
 arrhythmias
 were
 observed
 (Table
 2
 upper
panels).
 Upon
 increasing
 the
 dose
 to
 0.04
 mg/kg
 (Table
 2
 lower
 pan-
els),
 repolarization
 parameters
 increased
 beyond
 those
 seen
 with
either
 dose
 of
 DHE.
 In
 addition,
 QRS
 duration
 increased
 significantly
(51
 ±
 2
 to
 69
 ±
 13*
 ms),
 and
 first
 and
 second-degree
 AV
 block
 (7/7
and
 6/7
 rabbits)
 were
 observed
 that
 were
 likely
 the
 result
 of
 exces-
sive
 QT
 prolongation
 [40].
 In
 2
 rabbits
 SEB’s
 and
 MEB’s
 were
 seen,
in
 each
 of
 these
 animals
 1
 short
 TdP
 episode
 was
 observed.
3.5.
 DHE
 in
 the
 proarrhythmic
 cAVB
 dog
 model
Plasma
 
concentrations
 
after
 
i.v.
 
administration
 
of
 
either
0.33
 mg/kg
 or
 0.5
 mg/kg
 DHE
 were
 determined
 (Fig.
 5).
DHE
 (0.33
 mg/kg)
 considerably
 increased
 repolarization
 dura-
tion
 (QT
 +
 48
 ±
 10%*)
 without
 affecting
 conduction
 (Table
 3
 upper
panels).
This
 culminated
 in
 the
 development
 of
 single
 and
 multiple
ectopic
 beats
 in
 all
 animals,
 and
 eventually
 in
 multiple
 TdP
 arrhyth-
mia
 episodes
 in
 2
 dogs
 (Fig.
 6).
In
 one
 additional
 animal
 a
 single
 long-lasting
 TdP
 arrhythmia
was
 induced
 and
 had
 to
 be
 terminated
 by
 electrical
 cardioversion.
In
 the
 same
 animals
 dofetilide
 induced
 a
 similar
 increase
 in
 repolar-
ization
 duration
 (QT
 +
 48
 ±
 6%*).
 Also
 TdP
 inducibility
 was
 similar,
with
 2/4
 dogs
 showing
 multiple
 TdP
 episodes
 and
 one
 additional
animal
 showing
 a
 single
 non
 self-terminating
 TdP
 arrhythmia.
Administration
 of
 0.5
 mg/kg
 DHE
 significantly
 increased
 QT
duration
 from
 382
 ±
 31
 to
 577
 ±
 25*
 ms
 (Table
 3
 lower
 panels),
which
 was
 not
 different
 from
 the
 increases
 in
 repolarization
 dura-
tion
 seen
 with
 the
 lower
 dose
 of
 DHE.
 Surprisingly,
 none
 of
 the
 dogs
developed
 TdP
 (Fig.
 7).
In
 contrast,
 in
 75%
 of
 these
 animals
 dofetilide
 was
 able
 to
reproducibly
 induce
 TdP
 arrhythmias
 with
 comparable
 increases
in
 repolarization
 parameters.
3.6.
 Effects
 of
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 on
 NaV1.5
 and
 CaV1.2
channels
Prediction
 of
 proarrhythmogenity
 can
 be
 improved
 by
 consid-
ering
 the
 effect
 of
 drugs
 on
 currents
 from
 three
 key
 ion
 channels:
hERG,
 Nav1.5
 and
 Cav1.2
 [41].
 We  have
 therefore
 investigated
 the
effects
 of
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 in
 HEK
 cells
 stably
 expressing
 NaV1.5
and
 transiently
 expressing
 CaV1.2
 channels.
 At
 the
 concentration
of
 10
 �M
 neither
 DHE
 nor
 hortiamine
 had
 any
 effect
 on
 sodium
(Fig.
 8A,B,
 n
 =
 3)
 and
 barium
 (Fig.
 8C,D,
 n
 =
 3)
 currents
 through
NaV1.5
 and
 CaV1.2
 channels,
 respectively.
3.7.
 Effects
 of
 Evodia
 extracts,
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 on
 hiPSC-CMs
To
 evaluate
 further
 the
 proarrhythmic
 risks,
 methanolic
 extracts
of
 Evodia
 rutaecarpa
 (E1
 and
 E2,
 see
 Supplemental
 Material),
 DHE
and
 hortiamine
 were
 tested
 in
 hiPSC-CMs.

 Discussion
 and
 conclusions
Using
 multiple
 models
 (cells,
 normal
 rabbits
 and
 cAVB
 dogs)
that
 have
 been
 previously
 used
 to
 determine
 the
 safety
 of
 (non)
cardiovascular
 drugs,
 we
 showed
 that
 DHE
 has
 strong
 proarrhyth-
mic
 properties
 that
 seem
 to
 be
 self-limiting
 at
 higher
 dosages.
The
 proarrhythmic
 effects
 of
 DHE
 at
 the
 submaximal
 dose
 are
comparable
 to
 dofetilide,
 an
 anti-arrhythmic
 agent
 known
 for
 its
proarrhythmic
 liability.
We identified
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 (Fig.
 1)
 as
 hERG
 inhibitors
by
 an
 approach
 combining
 HPLC-microfractionation,
 patch
 clamp
studies
 on
 mammalian
 cell
 lines
 expressing
 hERG,
 and
 on-line
and
 off-line
 spectroscopic
 analysis
 [34,42].
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
inhibited
 hERG
 channels
 expressed
 in
 a
 mammalian
 cell
 line
at
 submicromolar
 concentrations
 (IC50(DHE)
 =
 253.2
 ±
 26.3
 nM,
n
 =
 4;
 IC50(hortiamine)
 =
 144.8
 ±
 35.1
 nM,
 n
 =
 4;
 Fig.
 1C).
 Chan-
nel
 block
 in
 Xenopus
 oocytes
 occurred
 at
 higher
 concentrations
(IC50(DHE)
 =
 6.9
 ±
 0.8
 �M,
 
n
 =
 4;
 
IC50(hortiamine)
 =
 4.0
 ±
 0.7
 �M,
n
 =
 4;
 Fig.
 S1
 in
 Supplemental
 Material).
 This
 is
 in
 line
 with
 the
 com-
monly
 observed
 reduced
 channel
 block
 in
 Xenopus
 oocytes
 [43].
hERG
 channel
 block
 by
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 was
 dramatically
reduced
 by
 mutations
 of
 the
 two
 known
 putative
 binding
 deter-
minants
 on
 S6
 segments
 (Y652,
 F656,
 Fig.
 2).
 Docking
 suggested
that
 DHE
 binds
 to
 the
 central
 cavity
 of
 hERG
 and
 forms
 hydropho-
bic
 interactions
 with
 Y652,
 and
 �-
 �-stacking
 interactions
 with
the
 aromatic
 rings
 of
 F656.
 Furthermore,
 our
 data
 suggest
 that
 the
indole
 ring
 of
 DHE
 is
 able
 to
 arrange
 itself
 between
 Y652
 and
 F656
in
 a
 sandwich
 type
 manner,
 thereby
 allowing
 �-�
 stacking
 inter-
actions
 with
 both
 amino
 acids
 (Fig.
 3).
We
 subsequently
 focused
 on
 DHE,
 given
 that
 the
 compound
 is
present
 in
 Evodia
 at
 much
 higher
 concentrations
 than
 hortiamine
[1,34].
 DHE
 concentration-dependently
 increased
 repolarization
duration
 in
 isolated
 cAVB
 cardiomyocytes
 (Fig.
 4).
 Maximum
 effects
were
 observed
 using
 1
 �M
 DHE,
 whereby
 a
 large
 increase
 in
 repo-
larization
 duration
 and
 STV
 was
 observed,
 and
 EAD’s
 were
 induced
in
 all
 cells.
 Compared
 to
 literature
 data
 for
 dofetilide,
 the
 effect
 of
DHE
 on
 repolarization
 and
 STV
 was
 stronger
 (Table
 1),
 suggesting
 at
first
 a
 comparable
 or
 even
 higher
 proarrhythmic
 potential
 of
 DHE.
However,
 with
 10
 �M
 DHE
 concentration,
 APD
 prolongation,
 STV
increase,
 and
 EAD
 incidence
 were
 reduced
 compared
 to
 1
 �M
 DHE.
In
 the
 anesthetized
 rabbits,
 repolarization
 prolongation
 was
 the
most
 important
 electrophysiological
 effect
 after
 0.05
 and
 0.5
 mg/kg
DHE
 (Table
 2).
 While
 no
 arrhythmias
 were
 seen
 after
 the
 lower
 dose
of
 DHE,
 0.5
 mg/kg
 DHE
 induced
 TdP
 arrhythmias
 in
 2
 out
 of
 8
 ani-
mals,
 and
 STV
 increased
 accordingly.
 Interestingly,
 despite
 similar
QT
 prolongation
 seen
 with
 the
 low
 dose
 of
 the
 specific
 IKr blocker
dofetilide
 (0.004
 mg/kg),
 no
 arrhythmias
 were
 induced.
 Despite
 an
increase
 in
 repolarization
 parameters
 beyond
 those
 observed
 with
either
 dose
 of
 DHE,
 also
 the
 high
 dose
 of
 dofetilide
 (0.04
 mg/kg)
 did
not
 induce
 TdP.
 The
 higher
 STV
 values
 seen
 after
 administration
 of
this
 dose
 were
 likely
 due
 to
 the
 presence
 of
 AV
 block
 which
 influ-
ences
 the
 measurements
 and
 analysis.
 However,
 Kijtawornrat
 and
co-workers
 observed
 TdP
 arrhythmias
 in
 2/10
 and
 2/6
 ketamine-
xylazine
 anesthetized
 rabbits
 after
 administration
 of
 a
 similar
dose
 of
 dofetilide
 (0.04
 mg/kg/10
 min)
 and
 another
 class
 III
 agent,
clofilium
 [44].
 Similar
 or
 higher
 QTC values
 (0.04
 mg/kg
 dofetilide
QTC +
 ∼150
 ms;
 0.4
 mg/kg
 clofilium
 QTC +
 ∼225
 ms)
 were
 observed
compared
 to
 dofetilide
 treated
 rabbits.
 In
 chloralose-anesthetized
rabbits
 similar
 results
 were
 reported.
 Clofilium
 (6.0
 �mol/kg)
 and
almokalant
 (78.5
 �mol/kg)
 induced
 TdP
 arrhythmias
 in
 respec-
tively
 3/10
 and
 1/6
 of
 the
 animals
 tested
 [45,46].

between
 QTC prolongation
 and
 TdP
 incidence
 with
 dofetilide
 and
DHE
 could
 be
 due
 to
 the
 limited
 predictive
 power
 of
 the
 QT
 interval
regarding
 induction
 of
 arrhythmias
 [47].
 However,
 regarding
 the
results
 with
 class
 III
 agents
 mentioned
 above,
 the
 TdP
 incidence
with
 dofetilide
 in
 our
 study
 could
 be
 an
 underestimation.
 In
 this
case
 a
 TdP
 incidence
 of
 2/8
 with
 0.5
 mg/kg
 DHE
 would
 suggest
 a
proarrhythmic
 potential
 similar
 to
 several
 class
 III
 compounds
 and
might
 thus
 be
 labeled
 ‘high
 risk’
 or
 ‘unsafe’
 [48].
The
 dose-dependent
 proarrhythmic
 potential
 of
 DHE
 was
 con-
firmed
 in
 the
 proarrhythmic
 cAVB
 dog
 model.
 At
 a
 dose
 of
0.33
 mg/kg,
 which
 is
 equivalent
 to
 the
 0.5
 mg/kg
 dose
 in
 rabbits
when
 taking
 into
 account
 the
 blood
 volume
 and
 body
 surface
 area,
DHE
 prolonged
 repolarization
 and
 induced
 TdP
 arrhythmia
 to
 the
same
 extent
 as
 dofetilide
 (Fig.
 6,
 Table
 3
 upper
 panels).
 Thus,
 the
effects
 of
 DHE
 and
 dofetilide
 did
 not
 differ.
 Surprisingly,
 a
 moderate
increase
 in
 dose
 to
 0.5
 mg/kg
 led
 to
 similar
 increases
 in
 repo-
larization
 duration
 without
 an
 induction
 of
 arrhythmias
 (Fig.
 7,
Table
 3
 lower
 panels).
 Taking
 into
 account
 the
 plasma
 concentra-
tions
 reached
 (Fig.
 5),
 0.33
 mg/kg
 DHE
 could
 be
 considered
 mainly
a
 hERG/IKr blocker
 with
 minimal
 or
 no
 effect
 on
 other
 cardiac
 ion
currents.
Our
 in
 vitro
 and
 in
 vivo
 studies
 revealed
 for
 the
 first
 time
proarrhythmic
 effects
 of
 DHE
 which
 is
 in
 contrast
 to
 previously
 sug-
gested
 antiarrhythmic
 activity
 [9,49].
 According
 to
 our
 findings,
 the
decrease
 in
 proarrhythmic
 potential
 of
 the
 higher
 dose
 of
 0.5
 mg/kg
cannot
 be
 explained
 by
 additional
 blockage
 of
 other
 ion
 currents,
 as
we
 did
 not
 observe
 any
 block
 of
 NaV1.5
 and
 CaV1.2
 channels
 by
 DHE
and
 hortiamine
 at
 10
 �M
 (Fig.
 8;
 but
 see
 data
 from
 different
 assays
[8,9,49]).
 Moreover,
 we  did
 not
 observe
 QRS
 interval
 widening
 or
negative
 inotropic
 effects,
 which
 may
 also
 speak
 against
 block-
age
 of
 these
 ion
 currents.
 However,
 extra
 cardiac
 effects
 cannot
be
 excluded.
 These
 self-limiting
 electrophysiological
 properties
 of
DHE
 are
 not
 unique,
 as
 they
 have
 been
 already
 shown
 for
 cisapride
and
 vernakalant
 [31].
The
 use
 of
 iPSC-CMs
 in
 drug
 safety
 studies
 has
 been
 proposed
 by
the
 Food
 and
 Drug
 Administration
 (FDA)
 in
 frame
 of
 the
 “Compre-
hensive
 in
 vitro
 Proarrhythmia
 Assay”
 (CiPA)
 initiative
 as
 suitable
in
 vitro
 model
 for
 evaluation
 of
 the
 drug
 proarrhythmic
 risks
 [50].
We  therefore
 investigated
 the
 effects
 of
 Evodia
 extracts,
 DHE
 and
hortiamine
 on
 APD
 in
 hiPSC-CMs.
 The
 concentration-dependent
APD
 prolongation
 was
 confirmed
 for
 two
 methanolic
 extracts
(Fig.
 9A,B,
 left
 panel)
 prepared
 from
 E.
 rutaecarpa
 fruits
 that
 were
purchased
 from
 the
 different
 suppliers
 (see
 Supplemental
 Materi-
als).
 DHE
 and
 hortiamine
 also
 prolonged
 APD
 in
 hiPSC-CMs
 cells
 in
a
 concentration-dependent
 manner
 from
 0.01
 to
 1
 �M
 and
 induced
EADs
 at

 (Fig.

 In

 induced

 However,

 after

 of

 (prepared
 and
 dosed
 according
 to
 Chinese
standards)
 are
 not
 known
 at
 present.
The
 oral
 bioavailability
 of
 DHE
 was
 demonstrated
 in
 several
pharmacokinetic
 studies
 in
 rats
 which
 received
 either
 the
 pure
compound
 or
 an
 Evodia
 preparation
 by
 intragastric
 administra-
tion
 [51,53–55].
 Lin
 et
 al.
 [51]
 reported
 that
 the
 oral
 bioavailability
of
 DHE
 was
 approximately
 15%,
 and
 protein
 binding
 was
 65%.
 In
an
 intestinal
 absorption
 model
 with
 Caco-2
 cells,
 DHE
 permeated
the
 monolayer
 without
 any
 directional
 preference,
 gave
 additional
evidence
 for
 intestinal
 absorption
 [54].
From
 a
 consumer
 safety
 perspective
 and
 in
 view
 of
 clinical
 impli-
cations,
 quantitative
 data
 on
 the
 DHE
 content
 in
 commercially
available
 Evodia
 preparations
 seemed
 of
 particular
 interest.
 The
content
 of
 DHE
 in
 various
 Evodia
 products
 were
 previously
 deter-
mined
 and
 the
 amount
 in
 recommended
 daily
 doses
 calculated
[56].
 DHE
 was
 detected
 in
 all
 herbal
 drug
 and
 finished
 products
(extract
 granules
 commercially
 available
 in
 Europe),
 but
 quanti-
tative
 differences
 were
 observed
 between
 the
 products.
 Overall,
the
 possible
 daily
 intake
 from
 crude
 drugs
 appeared
 significantly
higher
 than
 from
 processed
 Evodia-containing
 products.
 Although
we
 found
 prolongation
 of
 repolarization
 by
 DHE,
 hortiamine
 and
Evodia
 exctracts
 in
 hiPSC-CMs,
 and
 prolongation
 of
 repolariza-
tion
 and
 TdP
 arrhythmias
 induced
 by
 concentrations
 of
 DHE
 that
might
 be
 clinically
 relevant
 in
 dogs,
 these
 results
 cannot
 be
 directly
extrapolated
 to
 the
 herbal
 drug
 itself,
 or
 to

ished

 The

 that
can
 either
 potentiate
 or
 counteract
 the
 proarrhythmic
 effects
 of

 and

 Our
study
 should
 increase
 awareness
 of
 possible

and
 warrant
 future
 investigations,
 such
 as
 QT

 in
humans
 taking

 and

 of

 From
 a
 consumer

 perspective,
the
 case
 of
 Evodia
 products
 and
 DHE
 shows
 that
 investigations
 into
possible
 hERG
 liabilities
 and
 cardiac
 safety
 of
 other
 herbal
 products,
in
 particular
 alkaloid-containing

 drugs,
 are
 needed.
