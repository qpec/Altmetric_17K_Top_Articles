Abstract
Nrf2, a transcriptional activator of cell protection genes, is an attractive therapeutic target for
the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Current
Nrf2 activators, however, may exert toxicity and pathway over-activation can induce detri-
mental effects. An understanding of the mechanisms mediating Nrf2 inhibition in neurode-
generative conditions may therefore direct the design of drugs targeted for the prevention of
these diseases with minimal side-effects. Our study provides the first in vivo evidence that
specific inhibition of Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, can prevent neuronal toxicity in
response to the AD-initiating Aβ42 peptide, in correlation with Nrf2 activation. Compara-
tively, lithium, an inhibitor of the Nrf2 suppressor GSK-3, prevented Aβ42 toxicity by mecha-
nisms independent of Nrf2. A new direct inhibitor of the Keap1-Nrf2 binding domain also
prevented synaptotoxicity mediated by naturally-derived Aβ oligomers in mouse cortical
neurons. Overall, our findings highlight Keap1 specifically as an efficient target for the re-
activation of Nrf2 in AD, and support the further investigation of direct Keap1 inhibitors for
the prevention of neurodegeneration in vivo.

 progression, and this will cause an overwhelming future burden on our healthcare system
and immense suffering for many more patients and their families. Nrf2 is a gene that nor-
mally protects cells from stressful conditions. Although we don’t know why, Nrf2 is
reduced in the brains of AD patients and this may explain the increased susceptibility of
neurons to damage in neurodegenerative diseases. Our research, using a fruit fly model,
identifies Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, as a valid target for the rescue of AD-related
Nrf2 defects and the subsequent prevention of neuronal degeneration. Moreover, we
show that a new compound, which directly blocks the binding between Nrf2 and Keap1,
can prevent toxicity of the AD-initiating Aβ peptide in mouse neurons. Hence, our study
provides strong evidence that direct Keap1-Nrf2 disruptors can specifically target the
defects in Nrf2 activity observed in neurodegenerative diseases, and supports the further
development of such compounds as potential new drugs to prevent neuronal decline AD
and other neurodegenerative conditions.
Introduction
The transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2) targets cellular defence genes
containing antioxidant response elements (ARE), which include antioxidant enzymes (gluta-
mate cysteine ligase; GCL), drug metabolising enzymes (cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-
transferases; GSTs), molecular chaperones, DNA repair enzymes and proteasome subunits[1].
Activation of these protective genes in response to Nrf2 enables the cell to maintain redox bal-
ance and to remove damaged proteins under conditions of oxidative and xenobiotic stress.
Such cellular stress is a key feature of several neurodegenerative diseases. Markers of oxida-
tive damage are increased in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)[2,3], Parkinson’s disease
(PD)[4–6], Huntington’s disease (HD)[7] and, in CSF, of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
patients[8]. Some evidence also suggests that AD, PD and ALS patients have reduced xenobi-
otic metabolism [9] and that the AD-causing Aβ42 peptide may act as a xenobiotic[10]. As
Nrf2 is inhibited in several neurodegenerative diseases[1, 11], including AD[11] and ALS[12],
as well as in APP/PS1 mutant mouse models of AD[13], deficits in this important cellular pro-
tection pathway may, in part, explain the cellular damage associated with these conditions.
Conversely, Nrf2 over-expression protects against toxicity induced by the Aβ42 peptide in
mammalian cells[13,14], and prevents neuronal pathology in mouse models of ALS[15], PD
[16] and AD[17]. Activation of Nrf2 is, therefore, increasingly implicated as an attractive target
for the prevention of several neurodegenerative conditions.
Potent activators of Nrf2 have been developed[18], and confer protection against chemi-
cally-induced neurotoxic insults[19] and improve memory deficits in mouse models of AD
[20]. Many of these Nrf2 activators, however, have been reported to exert toxicity due to off-
target effects[21][22]. Additionally, unregulated activation of Nrf2 can have detrimental conse-
quences, with prolonged, ubiquitous activation shortening lifespan in Drosophila[23], and
mutations in the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1) causing cancer
in humans[24]. Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which Nrf2 function is
inhibited in neurodegenerative disease may enable the design of drugs targeted for the preven-
tion of these conditions with minimal side-effects.
Nrf2 activity is tightly regulated by two main inhibitors, Keap1 and GSK-3 (glycogen
synthase kinase-3)[25] (S1 Fig). GSK-3 plays a well-established role in the pathogenesis of AD
[26], and GSK-3 inhibitors, including lithium, prevent pathology in animal models of AD
[26,27], ALS[28] and PD[29]. Emerging evidence also suggests that inhibiting Keap1 can

 ameliorate neuronal degeneration, with Keap1 RNA interference (RNAi) protecting against
Aβ42[30] and MPTP[31] toxicity in cells, and heterozygous loss of Keap1 protecting against
neuronal pathology in Drosophila models of PD[32,33]. Both GSK-3 and Keap1 may, there-
fore, serve as valid candidates for mediating the inhibition of Nrf2 in neurodegenerative dis-
eases, and their inhibition may enable the prevention of Nrf2 deficits, neuronal stress and
degeneration specifically in these conditions. A comparative analysis of the efficiency of their
inhibition in rescuing Nrf2 deficits in neurodegenerative diseases specifically, however, is
required.
We aimed therefore to investigate the role of Nrf2 in mediating the protective effects of
GSK-3 and Keap1 inhibition against Aβ42 toxicity. Using an inducible Drosophila model of
AD[34], we confirmed that Aβ42 inhibits activity of the fly homolog of Nrf2 (cap-n-collar iso-
form C, cncC[35]) in neurons, consistent with previous findings in mice[13]. Both inhibition
of GSK-3, using lithium, and loss-of-function mutations in Keap1 protected against Aβ42 tox-
icity in this model. We found, however, that neuronal protection in response to Keap1 inhibi-
tion correlates with the rescue of Aβ42-induced Nrf2 defects, whereas lithium treatment
appears to exert neuro-protection independently of Nrf2.
Consistent with Nrf2 activation, Keap1 inhibition prevented the enhanced sensitivity of
Aβ42-expressing flies to xenobiotic stress, but exerted minimal protection against oxidative
damage in comparison to lithium treatment. Combined modulation of Keap1 and lithium
additively protected against Aβ42 toxicity, in comparison with either treatment alone, but did
not improve their respective effects on xenobiotic and oxidative damage. This further supports
the divergent beneficial effects of these manipulations. Down-regulation of Keap1 alone addi-
tionally protected against Aβ42 toxicity by mechanisms correlating with enhanced degradation
of Aβ42 peptide.
Overall our data highlight Keap1 as an efficient target for the amelioration of Nrf2 deficits
and protection against neuronal damage in AD. Finally, we show for the first time that a
newly-described direct inhibitor of the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction[22] can indeed
protect against the synapto-toxicity of naturally-derived Aβ oligomers in primary mouse neu-
ronal cultures. As current Nrf2 activators may exert toxicity due to off-target effects, our data
suggest that blocking the specific interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1 may provide an exciting new
avenue for the discovery of disease-modifying treatments for AD, and potentially other neuro-
degenerative conditions.
Results
Aggregating Aβ42 peptides inhibit Nrf2/cncC activity in Drosophila
Over-expression of APP in mice inhibits expression of Nrf2 target genes[13]. Comparing
expression, at equivalent levels[36], of various Aβ species in adult fly neurons, we have shown
that the presence of aggregating Aβ42 peptides may specifically mediate this effect. Using
Nrf2/cncC reporter flies (gstD1-GFP; [35]), RU486 induction of a single, site-directed, copy of
Arctic mutant Aβ42 (ArcAβ42), but not WT Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptides, significantly reduced
Nrf2/cncC activity compared to un-induced gstD1-GFP-expressing controls (Fig 1A and 1B).
Only ArcAβ42 flies develop pathological phenotypes under these expression conditions. More-
over, inducing high levels of WT Aβ42 using an independent random-insertion line, which
does cause neuronal decline [37], also significantly reduced Nrf2/cncC activity (Fig 1C). This
suggests that the inhibition of Nrf2 may be related to the concentration-dependent ability of
Aβ42 to aggregate and exert toxicity.
Consistent with a specific inhibition of neuronal Nrf2/cncC activity in response to
Aβ42 expression, ArcAβ42 reduced GFP levels in the heads, but not bodies (S2A Fig), of

 RU486-induced flies. Microarray analyses further revealed several pathways and processes that
might mediate toxicity in response to ArcAβ42 expression in fly neurons (Fig 1D, Arc Aβ42).
Comparing this data-set to a previously published microarray analysis using flies ubiquitously
over-expressing Nrf2/cncC (Fig 1D, cncC[38]), we found that Aβ42 expression induced recip-
rocal effects on gene ontology (GO) categories normally regulated by the Nrf2 pathway. Aβ42
activated processes that are down-regulated, and inhibited processes that are up-regulated, by
cncC (Fig 1D & S2B Fig), further confirming its suppressive effect on Nrf2 signalling.
Overall these findings suggest that the inhibition of Nrf-2 in AD is robustly conserved in
Drosophila, and that this deficiency is caused by the Aβ42 peptide directly. Moreover, as we
also observed a suppression of Nrf2/cncC in flies over-expressing human 0N3R tau or the
ALS-related C9orf72 (GR) 100 di-peptide repeat protein (DPR) [40] in adult neurons (S3A
and S3B Fig), our findings suggest that the accumulation of toxic proteins may lead to the gen-
eralised defect in Nrf2 signalling observed in neurodegenerative diseases.
At therapeutic levels inhibition of Keap1, but not lithium treatment,
rescues Nrf2 defects in response to Aβ42 expression
Drosophila thus provide an excellent context for further analysis of the mechanisms by which
Aβ42 regulates Nrf2 in vivo. As cncC, MafS and Keap1 mRNA transcripts were unaltered by
Aβ42 in our flies (S3C Fig), we hypothesised that Aβ42 modulates Nrf2 activity by altering its
biochemical interaction with upstream regulators.
Keap1 is a well-known negative regulator of Nrf2 activity in response to oxidative and xeno-
biotic stressors[41], but its role in mediating damage in response to neurotoxic proteins has
not been widely studied in vivo. Genetically reducing Keap1, alone, extended lifespan (Fig 2A)
and rescued neuronal-specific motor defects in both WT (S4 Fig) and ArcAβ42-expressing
flies (Fig 2B) using two independent alleles, Keap1del [42] and Keap1EY5[35]. GSK-3 has more
recently been shown to inhibit Nrf-2[43], independently of Keap1, but has long been impli-
cated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including AD[26]. We have
previously shown that lithium, a well-described GSK-3 inhibitor[44–46], prevents Aβ42 toxic-
ity in our fly model [34]. Thus both GSK-3 and Keap1 may serve as effective targets for the pre-
vention of neurodegeneration in AD.
We next compared the effects of manipulating both Keap1 and GSK-3 regulatory pathways
on Aβ42 toxicity and Nrf2/cncC activity in a parallel study. Using a dose of lithium (25 mM)
that prevented Aβ42-induced lifespan-shortening to a similar extent as heterozygous loss-of-
function mutations in Keap1 (Fig 2C, P = 0.739 comparing +RU, + LiCl 25 mM to +RU,
Keap1 del), this comparative analysis revealed that both manipulations rescued lifespan-

 shortening in Aβ42-expressing flies in an additive manner (Fig 2C, P<0.001 comparing +RU
+ LiCl 25 mM to +RU + LiCl 25 mM, Keap1 del), consistent with an independent mechanism
of action.
At these therapeutic levels, genetically reducing Keap1, alone, significantly rescued the
decline in Nrf2/cncC reporter expression observed in Aβ42-expressing flies (Fig 2D, p<0.05
comparing +RU vs +RU, Keap1 del). By contrast, although 25 mM lithium was sufficient to
rescue Aβ42 toxicity, a dose of 50–100 mM lithium, which may exert toxic effects [47], was
required to rescue Nrf2/cncC activity as measured using both microarray (S5A Fig) and gstD2
expression (S5B Fig) analyses. A heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in cncC (cncCK6
[48]; S5C Fig) did not alter the ability of lithium to protect against Aβ42-mediated lifespan-
shortening, further suggesting that Nrf2 is not required for lithium to exert its protective
effects in vivo. Consistent with our previous finding that lithium reduces Aβ42 levels, and pre-
vents toxicity, by blocking translation[47], early intervention concurrent with RU486 induc-
tion was required for lithium to protect against Aβ42-induced climbing defects (S5D Fig) and
was correlated with reduced Aβ42 levels from the point of induction (S5E Fig). This suggests
that, at therapeutically active concentrations, the protective effect of lithium against Aβ42 tox-
icity is not predominantly mediated by activating Nrf2, but rather by blocking Aβ42 peptide
accumulation through inhibition of translation.
Our data provide the first evidence that specific Keap1 inhibition can protect against Aβ42
toxicity in vivo, and they highlight Keap1 as a more efficient target for the prevention of Aβ42
peptide-induced Nrf2 inhibition in comparison with lithium treatment.
Keap1 inhibition protects predominantly against Aβ42-induced
xenobiotic, not oxidative, damage
As Nrf2 plays an important role in protecting against oxidative and xenobiotic stress, we inves-
tigated the nature of the Aβ42-induced molecular damage that was ameliorated by Keap1 inhi-
bition (Fig 3). UAS-ArcAβ42>elavGS control and heterozygous Keap1 mutant flies were
induced with RU486 for 14 days before measuring sensitivity to xenobiotic (DDT; dichlorodi-
phenyltrichloroethane) or oxidative (hyperoxia or paraquat) stressors (see methods).
Reducing Keap1 alone protected against Aβ42-induced sensitivity to DDT (Fig 3A) and
paraquat (Fig 3C), but not hyperoxia (Fig 3B; +RU vs +RU, Keap1 del). Lithium treatment, on
the other hand, protected against sensitivity of Aβ42 flies to DDT to a similar extent as Keap1
inhibition (Fig 3A), but more significantly protected against sensitivity to both hyperoxia (Fig
3B) and paraquat (Fig 3C)-induced oxidative damage. Moreover, when combined, lithium did
not add significantly to the ability of reduced Keap1 to protect against the sensitivity of Aβ42
flies to DDT (Fig 3A, +RU, +LiCl 25 mM Keap1 del vs +RU, Keap1 del) and, conversely,
reduced Keap1 did not add to the ability of lithium to protect against paraquat (Fig 3B) or
hyperoxia (Fig 3C, +RU, +LiCl 25 mM Keap1 del vs +RU, +LiCl 25 mM). Consistent with the
apparently different mechanisms of neuronal protection by Keap1 and lithium, this finding
suggests that Keap1 inhibition acts mainly through protection against xenobiotic stress and
lithium predominantly by limiting oxidative damage.
Keap1 inhibition induces Aβ42 degradation
In addition to increasing Nrf2/cncC activity, the protective effect of reducing Keap1 on Aβ42
toxicity correlated with a reduction in Aβ42 peptide levels (Fig 4A). Although Aβ42 mRNA
was also slightly reduced by down-regulation of Keap1 (Fig 4B), the peptide levels were not
altered until 14 days of age (Fig 4C), suggesting that reducing Keap1 may clear Aβ42 peptide
by activating protein degradation mechanisms.

 We have shown previously that Aβ42 peptide is stable for several weeks following induction
in our inducible fly model[49]. To assess whether the peptide is indeed degraded as a conse-
quence of reducing Keap1, we induced Aβ42 expression in Keap1del and control flies for one
week with RU486 then measured Aβ42 levels by ELISA at several time-points following trans-
fer to non-RU486-containing medium (Fig 4D). Aβ42 levels were equivalent between hetero-
zygous Keap1del and control flies at the end of the induction period (0d since switch-off; age
7d), but then declined only in flies with reduced Keap1, starting from 3 days following switch-
off (age 10d). This finding confirms that inhibition of Keap1 does indeed lead to degradation
of the Aβ42 peptide. Moreover, analysis of insoluble proteins one week following RU486
induction for 10 days (Fig 4E), revealed that inhibition of Keap1 reduced the level of aggre-
gated Aβ42.
Keap1-Nrf-2 signalling has been implicated in both autophagy and proteasomal degrada-
tion. p62, a selective autophagy substrate, competes with Nrf-2 for binding to Keap1[50][51]
and Keap1 may activate autophagy directly by binding to p62[52]. However, we did not
observe any alteration in autophagy activity upon reduction of Keap1 in the Aβ42-expressing
flies, as measured by western blotting using an antibody specific for Drosophila ATG8 (Fig
5A). Proteasome subunits are transcriptional targets of Nrf2/cncC[53] and over-expression
of cncC in flies, either directly or by reducing Keap1 levels, increases proteasome expression
and activity[23]. Accordingly, we detected an increase in proteasome activity in the heads of
Aβ42-expressing flies upon reduction of Keap1 (Fig 5B), at a time-point coinciding with
reduced Aβ42 levels (age 14d). Pharmacological inhibition of this enhanced proteasome activ-
ity (S6A Fig), however, did not prevent the degradation of Aβ42 in response to Keap1 inhibi-
tion (S6B Fig), suggesting that this may not be the mechanism by which loss of Keap1 induces
Aβ42 degradation. Further studies are therefore required to elucidate the precise clearance
mechanisms mediating Aβ42 degradation following Keap1 inhibition.
Direct Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors protect against Aβ oligomer-induced
synaptotoxicity in primary mouse neurons
Our data highlight Keap1 as a valid in vivo therapeutic target for AD. Current activators of
Nrf2 are electrophilic compounds, which commonly act by modifying cysteine residues on
Keap1 and thus disrupt its interaction with, and inhibition of, Nrf2[54]. Of these, the synthetic
triterpenoids, such as Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me), are potent Nrf2 activators and have
exhibited therapeutic potential against several diseases, including neurodegeneration, in ani-
mal models and clinical trials[55]. One problem with the mechanism of action of these ele-
ctrophilic Nrf2 activators, however, is the modification of cysteine residues on other targets
[21,22], which may lead to side-effects in humans[22,55]. To improve specificity, compounds
have more recently been designed to directly disrupt Keap1-Nrf2 binding, and these enhance
Nrf2 activity in vitro [56] and in cells[22,57]. Activity of these compounds against disease mod-
els, however, remains to be examined.
We tested the ability of a recently published direct Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitor, 22h (Fig 6A[22]),
to protect against exogenous amyloid toxicity in cultured cells. At their EC50 concentrations
for Nrf2 activation (S7 Fig), we first performed a comparative analysis of 22h, CDDO-Me and
the GSK-3 inhibitor, TDZD-8, for protection against natural Aβ oligomer-induced toxicity
[58] in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig 6B). Interestingly, Nrf2 and Keap1 protein levels were increased
25 mM, Keap1 del). No deaths were observed for mock injection flies for each condition. Log-rank test. N = 120–140 flies

 following 24 h Aβ oligomer treatment (S8 Fig), suggesting that the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway is
indeed dysregulated by acute Aβ exposure. TDZD-8 was a poor activator of Nrf2, inducing its
target gene NQO1 only at a single concentration of 1 μM (S7C Fig), and exerted toxicity in
control SH-SY5Y cells (Fig 6B). Although CDDO-Me was a more potent activator of Nrf2
(S7D Fig), 22h significantly protected against Aβ toxicity, in comparison with both CDDO
and TDZD-8, in this experimental paradigm (Fig 6B). This comparative analysis supports our
suggestion that Keap1 may serve as a more efficient target, than inhibition of GSK-3, for the
rescue of Nrf2-dependent effects of Aβ42 toxicity. Moreover, as TDZD-8 has previously been
shown to protect against Aβ toxicity in primary neuronal cultures, our data suggest that the

 threshold for this protective effect of GSK-3 inhibition lies below that for its effects on Nrf2
activity. These findings indicate that direct Keap1-Nrf2 disruptors may protect against Aβ42
toxicity more effectively than established Nrf2 activators.
To further test the effects of Keap1-Nrf2 disruption on neuronal function in response to Aβ
oligomers, we measured the effects of 22h in primary mouse neurons (Fig 6C). Conditioned
medium obtained from Tg2576 mouse neurons (Tg2576CM) has previously been shown to
contain oligomeric Aβ species at concentrations similar to those in human CSF, and to reduce
spine density of GFP-transfected WT mouse cortical neurons[59]. We pre-treated GFP-trans-
fected WT mouse neurons of 12 d in vitro (DIV), with 1 or 10 μM 22h for 16 h prior to admin-
istration of either wt or Tg2576 conditioned media (wtCM or Tg2576CM), with continued
22h treatment, for a further 24 h before examining spine density (see Materials & Methods).
As previously reported[59], Tg2576CM reduced total spine density of cortical neurons com-
pared to wtCM (Fig 6C and 6D). Strikingly, spine density was rescued by treatment with com-
pound 22h (Tg2576CM, 0.01% DMSO vs Tg2576CM, 10 μM 22h) at non-toxic doses (wtCM,
0.01% DMSO vs wtCM, 10 μM 22h). Aβ42 levels in conditioned media were unchanged fol-
lowing treatment with 10 μM 22h (Fig 6E) which further correlated with increased expression
of Nrf2 target genes[60] (Fig 6F).
These findings suggest that directly blocking the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction can protect neu-
rons downstream of extracellular amyloid toxicity.
Discussion
As the prevalence of ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, is pre-
dicted to rise dramatically[61], and with a lack of disease-modifying therapies currently
available, there is an urgent need to find new therapeutic targets to slow down neuronal degen-
eration in these conditions. Accumulating evidence suggests that down-regulation of the cell
protective transcription factor Nrf2 may enhance neuronal susceptibility to molecular damage
[1, 62], and that its activation may confer neuronal protection[63]. Nrf2 is, therefore, a promis-
ing novel target for the prevention of several neurodegenerative diseases, but its activation
must be tightly regulated to have beneficial effects[23,24]. Moreover, although current

 activators of Nrf2, including electrophilic compounds, such as sulforaphane, and the more
potent bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me), can exert neuroprotective effects[20,64], all of these
compounds are indirect activators and likely to exert multiple off-target effects[55], potentially
leading to toxicity. A better understanding of the precise mechanisms regulating Nrf2 activity
(S1 Fig) under particular pathological conditions would, therefore, enable the design of drugs
targeted to the prevention of specific diseases with minimal side-effects. Our work aimed to
investigate the mechanisms regulating Nrf2 inhibition specifically in response to the AD-
related Aβ42 peptide, with a view to identifying novel targets for the prevention of AD and
other ageing-related neurodegenerative conditions.
Nrf2 activity in Alzheimer’s disease
Our study firstly confirms, in Drosophila, previous reports that Nrf2 target genes are down-
regulated in AD brain[11], and in mouse models of AD[13,65,66]. Some studies suggest that
this inhibition may be mediated by Aβ42 directly, with exogenous, synthetic, Aβ42 peptide
reducing Nrf2 target gene expression in primary mouse neurons[13], and blocking Nrf2
nuclear translocation following injection into the hippocampus of rat[65] and mouse[66]
brain. As Aβ42 peptide is expressed in our fly model independently of APP processing, our
study further confirms that this direct effect on Nrf2 activity occurs in response to naturally-
derived Aβ42 peptide conformations in vivo (Fig 7B). Importantly, other disease-related pro-
teins, including tau and C9orf72 DPRs, also suppressed Nrf2/cncC signalling, but the non-
toxic Aβ40 peptide did not. This suggests that inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway is a generalised
response to the accumulation of aberrant proteotoxic proteins.
Fig 7. Keap1 and GSK-3 in the regulation of Nrf2 in Alzheimer’s disease. (A) Aβ42 peptide inhibits activity of
Nrf2, and this may explain the increased presence of xenobiotic and oxidative stress markers observed in Alzheimer’s
disease. (B) Although lithium can activate Nrf2 at high concentrations, its protective effect against Aβ42 toxicity
appears to be mainly Nrf2-independent, reducing Aβ42 levels by inhibiting translation[47] and preventing oxidative
damage. More specific GSK-3 inhibitors are required to confirm the precise role of GSK-3 in rescuing Nrf2 deficits in
neurodegenerative disease. (C) Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Keap1 can rescue Aβ42-induced Nrf2
inhibition and neuronal toxicity by preventing xenobiotic damage and activating degradation of Aβ42 peptide. (D)
Keap1 inhibitors may serve as effective therapies for AD and, in combination with GSK-3 inhibitors, may provide
added benefits in preventing neurodegeneration through non-overlapping mechanisms.

 The mechanisms mediating the effect of Aβ42 on Nrf2 activity remains to be established.
Although a recent report, using sweAPP-expressing cells, has suggested that Nrf2 transcripts
can be replenished by altering DNA methylation [67], Aβ42 did not alter mRNA expression of
Nrf2/cncC, or of its co-transcription factor MafS, in our Drosophila model. This suggests that
in vivo Nrf2 de-regulation in AD may be post-transcriptional. We have shown that Aβ42 oligo-
mers increased Nrf2 and Keap1 proteins in SH-SY5Y cells after 24 h treatment, suggesting that
Nrf2 is initially stabilised in response to acute amyloid exposure. This may represent a protec-
tive response to the initial toxic insult, as similar effects on Nrf2 have been observed at early
time-points following transient focal ischaemia and correlate with preservation of peri-infarct
regions of the brain under these conditions [68]. Keap1 is also an Nrf2 target gene [35], how-
ever, and may subsequently be upregulated to control Nrf2 activity following the initial expo-
sure to Aβ42 in our study. If sustained, this increase in Keap1 levels could provide a potential
mechanism for the inhibition of Nrf2 observed in AD brain and other chronic neurodegenera-
tive conditions [11]. This hypothesis is supported by observations that Nrf2 protein is downre-
gulated and Keap1 upregulated in mouse brain following 15 days exposure to synthetic Aβ42
[66]. Further work is required, however, to investigate the detailed timing of these events fol-
lowing chronic in vivo exposure to natural Aβ oligomers.
GSK-3 as a target for AD: Nrf2-independent mechanisms?
Since Aβ42 did not directly affect Nrf2/cncC gene expression, we investigated the role of its
upstream inhibitors, GSK-3 and Keap1, on toxicity. GSK-3 has a well-documented role in Alz-
heimer’s, and is suggested to provide a pivotal connection between the characteristic amyloid
plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies of this disease[26]. Activation of GSK-3 has been
proposed to exert neuronal toxicity by many mechanisms, including increasing apoptosis and
inflammation, and impairing axonal transport, synaptic function, cell cycle regulation and
adult neurogenesis [26]. Conversely, several GSK-3 inhibitors, including lithium, protect
against AD-pathology in mice[69–71] and some have been tested in clinical trials for AD[72].
Although GSK-3 inhibition increases Nrf2 activity in AD models[73], however, only one study
has shown epistatically that Nrf2 mediates the neuroprotective effect of lithium treatment
against paraquat toxicity in cells[74]. The role of Nrf2 in mediating the protective effect of
GSK-3 inhibition in AD has also not been empirically investigated.
Our current study confirms that lithium treatment increases transcription of Nrf2 target
genes in a dose-dependent manner. Concentrations of lithium required to activate Nrf2 (�50
mM-100 mM LiCl), however, have previously been shown to exert toxicity in Drosophila[42,47].
Lower doses of lithium (25 mM) were sufficient to protect against Aβ42 toxicity, to a level com-
parable with reducing Keap1, but did not significantly activate Nrf2/cncC. Moreover, genetically
reducing Nrf2/cncC function did not prevent the lifespan-extending effects of lithium, in Aβ42
flies, even at a maximizing concentration (50 mM). Our data, therefore, suggest that lithium
mediates neuroprotection against Aβ42 independently of its effects on Nrf2 (Fig 7B). Consistent
with our previous observations that lithium (10–100 mM) reduces Aβ42 peptide levels by inhib-
iting translation[47], early lithium administration reduced Aβ42 peptide, from the point of
induction, in our current study and this was required for lithium to exert its protective effects.
These findings are further supported by our observation that the specific GSK-3 inhibitor
TDZD-8 has a narrow window for Nrf2 activation in cultured cells, inducing its target gene
NQO1 only at a single concentration of 1 μM (Fig 6B). At concentrations � 1 μM TDZD-8 has
been described to prevent Aβ-induced reductions in spine density in mouse neurons[59], but
doses � 1 μM exerted toxicity (Fig 6B and [59]). Together these data suggest that the threshold
for protection against Aβ toxicity by GSK-3 inhibitors lies below the concentration required

 for activation of Nrf2 in neuron. This supports the hypothesis that blocking GSK-3 exerts its
protective effects independently of Nrf2.
Keap1 as a target for AD: Nrf2-dependent mechanisms?
Contrary to our findings with lithium, we provide the first in vivo evidence that Keap1 inhibi-
tion can exert neuroprotective effects in response to Aβ42 by ameliorating deficits in Nrf2
activity (Fig 7C). As with Drosophila models of PD[32,33], heterozygous loss of Keap1 pro-
tected against Aβ42-induced lifespan-shortening and climbing defects in the fly. Moreover, we
show that this protective effect of reducing Keap1 correlates significantly with a rescue of
Nrf2/cncC activity in response to Aβ42.
Only one previous study has addressed the role of Keap1 inhibition, specifically, in AD.
Keap1 RNA interference increased expression of Nrf2 target genes, protected against synthetic
Aβ42-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, and enhanced autop-
hagy in cultured cells[30]. Our study adds to these in vitro findings, demonstrating that Keap1
inhibition rescues Aβ42-induced Nrf2 deficits, and protects against neuronal decline in vivo.
These effects occur in correlation with prevention of xenobiotic and, to a lesser extent, oxida-
tive damage as well as the degradation of endogenous, aggregated, Aβ42 peptide.
Using primary cortical neurons, our findings further confirm that direct pharmacological
inhibition of Keap1-Nrf2 binding can protect against neuronal damage downstream of extra-
cellular Aβ42 oligomers. The mechanisms by which reducing Keap1 enhances degradation of
Aβ in vivo, however, requires further investigation. Autophagy, as measured by cleavage of
ATG8, was unaltered in response to Keap1 inhibition in our Aβ42 expressing flies. Consistent
with the established effect of Nrf2 on transcription of proteasome subunits[23], loss of Keap1
enhanced proteasome activity in Aβ42 flies, but blocking this increase, using the proteasome
inhibitor Bortezomib, did not prevent the reduction in Aβ42 levels. This suggests that the
reduction of aggregated Aβ42 in response to Keap1 inhibition may not be directly mediated
via enhanced autophagy or proteasomal degradation. Nrf2 has also been implicated to play a
role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), serving as a target for PERK[75] and activating
transcription of several components of the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway[76],
including chaperones and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, in addition to proteasome subunits
and autophagy. Future studies will therefore be required to investigate the functional role of
such protein quality control pathways, potentially upstream of the proteasome and autophagy,
in the clearance of Aβ42 following Keap1 inhibition in vivo.
Overall, our data point to Keap1, in comparison with GSK-3, as an efficient target for Nrf2
activation in response to Aβ42 toxicity in vivo. Recent advances in the development of direct
inhibitors of the Keap1-Nrf2 binding domain may, therefore, enable the prevention of Nrf2
deficits in neurodegenerative diseases with minimal side-effects. Our study shows for the first
time that a direct, small molecule inhibitor of Keap1-Nrf2 binding, 22h[22], can ameliorate
synaptotoxicity in response to naturally-derived Aβ oligomers in mouse cortical neurons. As
synaptic loss correlates well with cognitive decline[77], our work suggests that these com-
pounds show promise as therapeutic agents for AD. Moreover, as this is the first demonstra-
tion that these compounds can prevent neuronal toxicity, our findings warrant their
investigation in other neurodegenerative conditions.
Combined benefits of Keap1 and GSK-3 inhibition for AD?
Both GSK-3 inhibitors[71] and Nrf2 activators[55] can exert toxicity due to off-target effects
and thus it is important that modifiers of these pathways achieve therapeutic benefits at low
doses. More specific inhibitors of each of these targets are currently being developed[22,71]. It

 has also been postulated that combined inhibition of both GSK-3 and Keap1 may activate
Nrf2, and confer protection, at lower doses than either intervention alone, hence limiting their
detrimental effects[25].
We present the first in vivo study showing that combined Keap1 and GSK-3 inhibition, by
lithium, confers additive protective effects against Aβ42 toxicity. Keap1 deletion and lithium
treatment extended lifespan and improved climbing ability of Aβ42-expressing flies to a
greater extent than either manipulation alone. Additionally, reducing Keap1 limits the dose of
lithium required to reach maximal levels of protection since heterozygous Keap1del combined
with low dose (25 mM) lithium extended lifespan of Aβ42 flies to a similar extent as high dose
(50 mM) lithium alone. Our data, however, do not predict that these additive protective effects
are due to mechanisms converging on Nrf2. Rather, low dose lithium treatment exerts protec-
tive effects independently of Nrf2 activation, whereas the neuroprotective effects of Keap1
inhibition correlate strongly with increasing Nrf2. Hence, the additive nature of combined
lithium and Keap1 inhibition appears to be mediated through divergent, complementary pro-
tective mechanisms.
Oxidative[2,3] and xenobiotic damage[9] are key features of AD brain and may potentially
be explained by the down-regulation of Nrf2, which is also observed in several neurodegenera-
tive diseases. Consistent with this idea, Keap1 inhibition and, therefore, Nrf2/cncC activation,
correlated strongly with protection against Aβ42-induced sensitivity to the xenobiotic DDT in
our fly model. Conversely, Keap1 inhibition exerted minimal protection against oxidative dam-
age in comparison with lithium treatment, which strongly protected against Aβ42-induced sen-
sitivity to both paraquat and hyperoxia-induced damage. As therapeutic concentrations of
lithium, which can prevent oxidative damage, did not strongly activate Nrf2/cncC in our flies,
this suggests that rescue of Nrf2 activity is not required to protect against oxidative damage in
response to Aβ42. Although pharmacological activation of Nrf2, has been shown to protect
against oxidative damage, in response to Aβ42 peptide, in cells[78,79] and in animal models
of AD[65,66], conflicting reports have also described protective effects against such damage
that are mediated independently of Nrf2[80]. Moreover, studies showing protection against
Aβ42-induced oxidative damage in response to GSK-3 inhibition, using antisense oligonucleo-
tides[73] and in response to lithium[81], have not demonstrated a causal role of increasing Nrf2
activity. Our direct comparison of Keap1 and GSK-3 pathways, however, reveals that Nrf2 activ-
ity and prevention of Aβ42-induced oxidative damage do not strongly correlate.
Finally, combining lithium treatment with manipulation of Keap1 did not confer additional
protection against oxidative and xenobiotic damage respectively. Overall this suggests that
Keap1 and lithium treatment combine to maximise protection against AD-phenotypes,
through divergent effects on Nrf2 and by additively protecting against Aβ42-induced oxidative
and xenobiotic damage (Fig 7D).
Conclusions
Our findings provide compelling support for the use of direct Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors for the
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD. Future work is warranted to develop
these compounds further for in vivo use, and to investigate their effects in combination with
other established therapeutic targets for AD, such as specific GSK-3 inhibitors.

were obtained from Dr D. Bohmann (University of Rochester, USA), and cncCK6 mutant
flies, originally generated in the laboratory of William McGinnis (University of California, San
Diego, USA), from Dr A. Whitworth (University of Cambridge, UK). All fly lines were back-
crossed six times into the w1118 genetic background.
Lithium treatment
LiCl (Sigma) was dissolved in ddH20 at a concentration of 5 M before diluting to the indicated
final concentrations in SYA medium.
Bortezomib treatment
Bortezomib (New England Biolabs) was dissolved in ethanol at a stock concentration of 10
mM, and stored frozen at– 20˚C, before diluting to the indicated final concentrations in SYA
medium.
Lifespan analyses
Flies were raised at a standard density on SY medium in 200 mL bottles. Two days after eclo-
sion once-mated females were transferred to experimental vials containing SY medium with
or without RU486 at a density of 10 flies per vial. Deaths were scored and flies were transferred
to fresh food 3 times per week. Data are presented as cumulative survival curves, and survival
rates were compared using log-rank tests.
Negative geotaxis
Climbing assays were performed using methods adapted from Sofola O et al., 2010 [34].
Briefly, 15 adult flies were placed in a vertical glass column (SciLabware), tapped to the bottom,
and their ability to climb subsequently analysed. Flies reaching the top (above 10 cm) and flies
remaining at the bottom (below 3 cm) of the column after a 30 sec period were counted. Scores
recorded, from three trials per biological repeat, were the mean number of flies at the top
(ntop), the mean number of flies at the bottom (nbottom) and the total number of flies assessed
(ntot). A performance index (PI) defined as ½ (ntot + ntop—nbottom)/ ntot) was calculated. Data
are presented as the mean PI ± SEM obtained in three independent repeats for each group.
cncC activity
cncC activity was measured by crossing UAS-ArcAβ42;elavGS flies to gstD1-GFP reporter
flies, expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a 2.7kb genomic
sequence upstream of the cncC target gene gstD1 [35], and analyzing GFP levels by western

 Western blotting
Fly heads were homogenized in 2× laemmli sample buffer containing 100mM DTT. Pro-
teins were separated by SDS-PAGE at 150V for 1h using 10% Bis-Tris gels and Mes-SDS
running buffer (Invitrogen). Gels were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, incu-
bated in a blocking solution containing 5% milk proteins in TBST for 1h at room tempera-
ture, then probed with GFP (Cell Signaling, 2955S, 1:1000), ATG8 (custom made anti-
rabbit polyclonal against peptide EP113385 (Eurogentec) [42], 1:1000,) or actin (Santa
Cruz, sc-47778, 1:5,000) primary antibodies overnight at 4˚C. Anti-horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abcam, 1:12,000) were used and blots were
developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL) according to the manu-
facturers’ instructions (Luminata Crescendo; Millipore). Proteins were visualized using a
luminescent image analyzer (ImageQuant LAS 4000; GE Healthcare) and relative intensities
measured using ImageQuant software. Proteins of interest were expressed as a ratio relative
to actin levels in each sample.
Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed as
previously published[34,49]. For gene expression in Drosophila, primers, 5’ to 3’, were as fol-
low: Aβ forward GATCCTTCTCCTGCTAACC and reverse CACCATCAAGCCAATAATCG;
cncC forward GAGGTGGAAATCGGAGATGA and reverse CTGCTTGTAGAGCACCTCA
GC; MafS forward AGATCGTTCGGATGAAGCAG and reverse GTCTCCAGCTCGTCCTT
CTG; gstD2 forward CATCGCCGTCTATCTGGTGGA and reverse GGCATTGTCGTACCA
CCTGG; and eIF-1A reference gene forward ATCAGCTCCGAGGATGACGC and reverse
GCCGAGACAGACGTTCCAGA[82]. Genes of interest were expressed as a ratio relative to
eIF-1A.
For gene expression in primary mouse neuronal cultures, primers 5’ to 3’ were: Hmox1 for-
ward AGCACAGGGTGACAGAAGAG and reverse GGAGCGGTGTCTGGGATG, Srnx1
forward GACGTCCTCTGGATCAAAG and reverse GCAGGAATGGTCTCTCTCTG, and
xCT forward ATACTCCAGAACACGGGCAG and reverse AGTTCCACCCAGACTCGAAC,
as previously published [60]. Reference gene primers were to mouse actin forward AACCGT
GAAAAGATGACCCAGA and reverse CACAGCCTGGATGGCTACGTA. Genes of interest
were expressed as a ratio relative to actin.
Quantification of total and insoluble Aβ42 peptide
Total Aβ42 peptide, from fly heads, was extracted into guanidinium HCl (GnHCl) buffer
based as previously described[34,83]. Alternatively, soluble and insoluble Aβ pools were iso-
lated by differential centrifugation followed by formic acid extraction, as previously described
[49]. Aβ42 levels were then measured using the High Sensitivity Human Amyloid Aβ42 ELISA
kit (Millipore). Samples were diluted 1:100, for total Aβ42, or 1:10, for insoluble Aβ42, in
dilution buffer and ELISA performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Protein
extracts were quantified using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad laboratories Ltd, UK) and
the amount of Aβ42 in each sample expressed as a ratio of the total protein content (pmoles/g
total protein).
For cell culture, conditioned media was removed from cells, following compound treat-
ment, and diluted 1:2 in dilution buffer before measurement of Aβ42 levels by ELISA as
described above.

 Proteasome activity
Fly heads were homogenized in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and protein content determined by
Bradford assay. Chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity of the proteasome was assayed using the
fluorogenic peptide substrate Succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amidomethylcoumarin (LLVY-
AMC), as previously described[49]. Proteasome activity was determined as the slope of AMC
accumulation over time per mg of total protein (pmoles/min/mg).
Stress assays
Flies were prepared as for lifespan experiments then aged to the indicated time-points
before measuring stress resistance. For xenobiotic stress, flies were exposed to DDT vapour,
1 mg/mL diluted in acetone, in glass vials in the absence of food. For oxidative stress, flies were
subjected to hyperoxia (95% oxygen; PROOX model 110, Biospherix, USA) or injected with
paraquat (75 nLs of 1 mg/ml in Ringers buffer) and maintained on SYA media containing
RU486 ± LiCl as indicated. As survival times were short in these experiments flies were not
transferred to fresh food. Survival under each stress condition was then monitored by record-
ing the number of deaths every 2 hours from the start of decline. Data are presented as cumula-
tive survival curves, and survival rates were compared using log-rank tests.
Microarray analyses
The raw microarray data generated in this study are deposited in ArrayExpress (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) with identifier E-MTAB-4611. UAS-ArcAβ42/+;elavGS/+ flies were
treated, for 17 days, with standard SY medium alone (-RU) or medium containing RU486
in the absence (+RU) or presence of 100 mM Lithium Chloride (+RU, +LiCl). Flies used
for microarray analyses were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and, for each array, RNA
extracted from 200 heads using RLT buffer + 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol and purified with
RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The quality and concentration of RNA was confirmed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and further procedures followed the stan-
dard Affymetrix protocol. All samples were hybridized to the Drosophila Genome 2.0 Gene-
chip. In total, 4–5 biological replicates of each condition (-RU, +RU and +RU, +LiCl) were
performed.
Differential expression analysis
Raw data (cel files) were processed to correct for probe-sequence biases, by using bioconduc-
tor’s package gcrma (http://www.bioconductor.org) in R (http://www.r-project.org). Affyme-
trix’s MicroArray Suite 5.0 (bioconductor’s package affy) was used to determine present target
transcripts[84]. Transcripts were deemed present if the p-value was <0.111 and absent other-
wise. The raw data were summarized and normalized by using Robust Multichip Average
(rma function, part of bioconductor’s package affy [85]. In order to identify differentially
expressed genes a linear model was fitted and differential expression was assessed using the
empirical Bayes moderated t-statistic as implemented in R’s limma package [86]. P-values
were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing by applying the Benjamini and Hochberg correc-
tion for false discovery rate. Summarized probe-sets were mapped to transcripts using R’s
package "drosophila2.db". Transcripts not mapping to any known or predicted genes were
excluded from further analysis. The following freely available gene expression microarray data-
sets were used: control vs. hsp70-CncC (E-GEOD-30087).

 Gene Ontology analysis
The Wilcoxon rank sum test, as implemented in Catmap[87], was used to perform functional
analysis, that is significant enrichment of Gene Ontology categories. FlyBase (http://flybase.
org) gene identifiers were mapped to Gene Ontology identifiers (FlyBase version FB2014_01).
Ranks of genes were based on the p-value derived from the Bayes t-statistic for differential
expression. To account for multiple hypothesis testing, an enrichment of GO terms was
deemed statistically significant if the p-value derived from the wilcoxon rank sum test was
�1.0x10-05. Gene lists were sorted by log-fold change and p-value. For all microarray experi-
ments two sets of lists were derived; a gene list comprising most differentially up-regulated
(log-fold change > 0) genes at the top of the list and most differentially down-regulated genes
(log-fold change < 0) at the bottom of the list (termed up-to-down) and vice versa (termed
down-to-up). If a GO category was found to be statistically significant in the up-to-down list,
this GO was referred to as up-regulated, meaning that a large enough proportion of the genes
in this GO category were found to be up-regulated or at the top of the list. If a GO category
was found to be statistically significant in the down-to-up list, this GO was referred to as
down-regulated, meaning that a large enough proportion of the genes in this GO category
were found to be down-regulated or at the top of the list.
Statistical significance of Gene Ontology (GO) sets
Statistical significance of overlaps of GOs in two microarray experiments was determined
using fisher’s exact test. To account for multiple hypothesis testing a p-value cut-off of
�1.0x10-05 was used.
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell culture
SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37˚C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s
modified medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4.5g/L glucose, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin- strep-
tomycin, and differentiated with 10 μM retinoic acid. Cells were seeded at an appropriate den-
sity in 96-well plates prior to subsequent analyses.
NQO1 induction assay
SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a density of 2 x 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate and cultured
for 2 days before treatment for 24 hours with compound or vehicle (0.1% DMSO final concen-
tration). Cells were then lysed in 50 μl/well lysis buffer (0.1% Tween20 in 2 mM EDTA [pH
7.5]) for 15 mins at room temperature. 200 μl enzyme reaction mixture (25 mM Tris buffer
[pH 7.5] containing BSA [0.067%], Tween20 (0.01%), FAD (5 μM), Glucose 6 Phosphate
(G6P) (1 mM), NADP (30 μM), G6P dehydrogenase (40 units), MTT (0.03%), and menadione
(50 μM)) was added to each well. After 5 min at room temperature, 40 μl/well stop solution
(10% SDS) was added and the absorbance at 595 nm measured. The background optical den-
sity was measured using wells containing lysis buffer, enzyme and stop solutions without
SH-SY5Y cells. The optical density values at 595 nm were averaged and the background cor-
rected ratio of optical densities (compound treated/control) was calculated.
Resazurin toxicity assay
SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a density of 2 x 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate. Cells were
pre-treated with compound or vehicle overnight before either Aβ-conditioned Chinese Ham-
ster Ovary (CHO) cell media (7PA2CM) or WT-conditioned CHO media (wtCM) was added
to wells at a dilution of 50% for 24 hours. Resazurin (final concentration 20 μM) was added to

 wells and incubated for 4 hours at 37˚C, 5% CO2. The resulting fluorescence intensity was
measured at 590 nm. The relative fluorescence values were averaged and normalised to wtCM,
DMSO-treated control intensities.
Immunostaining
SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a density of 6,000 cells per well, in a 96-well plate then, after 24
hours, treated with 50% 7PA2CM or wtCM for a further 24 hours. Plates were fixed with 4%
PFA (v/v) for 15 minutes, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X
before staining with primary antibodies against Keap1 (1:50; ab150654, Abcam) and Nrf2 (1:100;
ab62352, Abcam) in blocking solution containing 10% goat serum and 3% BSA overnight at 4 C.
After 3 washes in PBS secondary antibodies (α rabbit Alexa 594, ab150080, α mouse FITC,
ab6785, Abcam) were applied. Nuclei were stained in a PBS solution of 10 μM Hoechst 33342
before high-resolution digital imaging using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope.
For quantification of Nrf2 and Keap1 staining, and cell morphology, 250 cells per well were
imaged using the IN Cell Analyzer 6000 automated laser-based imaging platform with confo-
cal modality (GE Healthcare) at 40X magnification. Automated image analysis was conducted
with the IN Cell Developer software using custom-developed analysis protocols. Cell nuclei
were identified by acquiring images in the DAPI channel (405 nm excitation, 455/50 emis-
sion). Whole cells were identified using images of Keap1 from the FITC channel (488 nm exci-
tation, 524/48 emission). Images were also acquired of Nrf2 in the dsRed channel (561 nm
excitation, 605/52 nm emission). The whole-cell intensity of Keap1 FITC and Nrf2 Alexa 594
was measured and expressed as average fluorescence units per cell for each well. N = 5 wells
per condition.
Preparation of Aβ-oligomers from Tg2576 mouse neuron conditioned
media
To obtain transgenic conditioned medium (TgCM) enriched in Aβ, neurons from Tg2576
mice were maintained for 14 days in vitro (DIV) without changing the medium[88]. Medium
from wild type neurons from littermates, wild type conditioned medium (wtCM), was used as
a control. The genotype of the animals was determined by polymerase chain reaction on DNA
obtained from fibroblasts.
Culture and treatment of primary mouse cortical neurons
Wild type primary neurons were obtained from cerebral cortex of CD1 mouse embryos, at
embryonic day 15, as previously described [89]. Neurons were plated to a density 6×105 viable
cells/35-mm2 on glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA) previously
coated with poly-D-lysine (10 μg/ml) for at least 1 h at 37˚C. Cultures were maintained at 37˚C
with 5% CO2, supplemented with neurobasal medium with 2% B27 nutrient, 2 mM L-glutamine,
penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). At 12 days in vitro (DIV) neurons, trans-
fected on day 7 with the plasmid peGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using lipofecta-
mine 2000 (Invitrogen), were pre-treated with the Keap1 inhibitor, 22h (10 μM[22]), or 0.1%
DMSO, for 16 h. Conditioned medium (CM) from Tg2576 transgenic, Aβ-enriched, or wild
type mouse neurons, with and without 22h, was then added for a further 24h before analysis.
Analysis of neuronal morphology
Neuronal morphology was assessed at 14 DIV by high-resolution digital imaging using a Zeiss
LSM700 confocal microscope and analysis using NeuronStudio software (CNIC, Mount Sinai

 School of Medicine). Spine density was defined as the number of spines per micrometer of
dendrite length according to previously published protocols[59]. Dendritic spine densities
were calculated from 6–17 neurons per condition.
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as means ± SEM obtained in at least three independent biological samples.
Log-rank, analysis of variances (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference)
post-hoc analyses were performed using JMP (version 11.0) software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA).
Ethics statement
Animals were maintained and treated in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act, 1986, following approval by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB),
KCL, and the Home Office Inspectorate, and performed in accordance with the European
Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC).

S1 Fig. Dual degradation model of Nrf2 regulation. Under basal conditions (A) Keap1
binds to, and sequesters, Nrf-2 in the cytoplasm and actively targets it for ubiquitination by
a Cullin3-based E3 ligase complex, thus enabling its degradation by the proteasome[1]. During
conditions of oxidative or xenobiotic damage (B), Keap1 is inhibited by reactive oxidant
species (ROS) and electrophiles, thus facilitating the stabilisation of Nrf-2 and enabling its
translocation to the nucleus. Nrf-2 then forms dimers with small Maf (musculo-aponeurotic
fibrosarcoma oncogene) proteins, which subsequently bind to and activate transcription of
antioxidant response element (ARE)–containing cell protective genes. Alternatively, GSK-3
can inhibit Nrf-2 (C) by targeting it for ubiquitination by a β-TrcP-Cullin1 complex[43],
through mechanisms that are independent of Keap1. A dual-degradation model for regulation
of Nrf-2 under different pathophysiological conditions has been hypothesized[25].
