Abstract
Importance—Physicians and investigators have sought to determine the relationship between 
body mass index (BMI) and colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes, but methodologic limitations 
including sampling selection bias, reverse causality, and “collider” bias have prevented the ability 
to draw definitive conclusions.
Objective—We evaluated the impact of BMI at the time of, and following colorectal cancer 
(CRC) diagnosis, on mortality in a complete population using causal diagrams.
Design—Retrospective observational study with prospectively collected data
Setting—Kaiser Permanente Northern California
Participants—3,408 men and women diagnosed 2006-2011 with stages I-III colorectal cancer 
who had surgery
Exposures—BMI at diagnosis, and 15 months following diagnosis
Main Outcomes and Measures—Hazard ratios for all-cause and CRC-specific mortality, 
relative to normal-weight patients, adjusted for sociodemographics, disease severity, treatment, 
and pre-diagnosis BMI.
Results—At-diagnosis BMI was associated with all-cause mortality in a nonlinear fashion, with 
underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/m2, hazard ratio [HR]=2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.63-4.31) 
and class II/III obese (BMI≥35 kg/m2, HR=1.33, 95% CI: 0.89-1.98) patients exhibiting elevated 
mortality risks, compared with low normal-weight (BMI 18.5-<23 kg/m2) patients. In contrast,

 high-normal-weight (BMI 23-<25 kg/m2, HR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.56-1.06), low-overweight (BMI 
25-<28 kg/m2, HR=0.75, 95% CI:0.55-1.04), and high-overweight (BMI 28-<30 kg/m2, HR=0.52, 
95% CI: 0.35-0.77) patients had lower mortality risks, and class I obese (BMI 30-<35 kg/m2) 
patients showed no difference in risk. Spline analysis confirmed a U-shaped relationship in 
participants (p-value, test for nonlinearity<0.001) with lowest mortality at BMI=28 kg/m2. 
Associations with CRC-specific mortality were similar. Associations of post-diagnosis BMI and 
mortality were also similar, but class I obese had significantly lower all-cause and cancer-specific 
mortality risks.
Conclusions and Relevance—Overweight patients consistently had the lowest mortality after 
a CRC diagnosis. Though strong scientific evidence shows that exercise in cancer patients should 
be encouraged, findings suggest, among overweight CRC patients, that recommendations for 
weight loss in the immediate post-diagnosis period may be unwarranted.

Introduction
Body mass index (BMI) is positively associated with the risk of colorectal cancer1-9. For that 
reason, investigators have hypothesized that overweight/obesity leads to worse colorectal 
cancer (CRC) prognosis. However, though previous studies have shown an apparently 
elevated mortality risk in class II/III obese (BMI≥35 kg/m2) patients10-12, associations of 
class I obesity (BMI 30-<35 kg/m2) and survival are mixed; some studies show a higher 
mortality risk6, 10, 13-16 and others show no higher17 or a possible lower18 mortality risk, 
depending in part on when BMI is measured relative to diagnosis. Overweight and obese 
CRC patients have shown lower mortality risks11, 18 compared with normal- or underweight 
patients when BMI is measured following diagnosis but concerns are that this “obesity 
paradox” could reflect sampling selection bias, reverse causality, and/or collider bias19-21. 
We sought to employ methods to overcome these concerns in our evaluation of the impact of 
BMI on post-diagnosis mortality.
First, many studies of weight and CRC survival are conducted in samples recruited after 
diagnosis causing concerns that only the healthiest may enroll. Such sampling selection bias 
could produce an obesity paradox if the sickest overweight patients are less likely to enroll 
than the sickest normal-weight patients or they die prior to enrollment. Second, underweight 
or normal-weight patients may have higher mortality, compared with overweight patients 
because they may include cachectic patients nearing death, i.e., reverse causality22. A third 
concern is collider bias20; in the presence of an unmeasured risk factor for CRC diagnosis 
(see eFigure 1 in the supplement), selecting a population based on a CRC diagnosis could 
introduce a spurious association between an exposure (e.g., post-diagnosis BMI) and an 
outcome (e.g., death) that could reverse the direction of association, making a harmful 
exposure appear protective21. I.e., collider bias may occur if overweight/obesity leads to 
higher disease incidence, but unmeasured risk factors occurring disproportionately in 
normal-weight patients are more strongly related to mortality than is overweight/obesity. In 
this case, spuriousness can be avoided with adjustment for pre-diagnosis BMI (eFigure 1).

 Using electronic medical record (EMR) data collected as a part of routine clinical care 
within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) population, we examined the 
effect of BMI at, and following, diagnosis on all-cause and CRC-specific mortality in KPNC 
CRC patients diagnosed from 2006-2011, using several strategies to overcome bias. These 
included the use of data from a complete population of CRC patients with longitudinally-
collected data, examination of associations in stage I patients not expected to be at imminent 
risk of death, stratification by weight loss status, and the use of causal diagrams to identify 
sufficient adjustment sets23 of covariates. Related to this, we were able to adjust for 
prospectively collected data on pre-diagnosis BMI, a unique feature of our data.
We hypothesized higher mortality risks in underweight and class II/III obese CRC patients, 
and a lower risk in overweight, vs. normal-weight, patients.
Methods
Study Population
The study population consisted of all patients ages 18-80 from KPNC diagnosed from 
2006-2011 with stage I-III invasive CRC whose cancer was confirmed by computed 
tomography, who received surgery, and for whom an electronic weight and height were 
available at diagnosis. Case ascertainment began in 2006, one year after weights routinely 
became available in the EMR, to enable inclusion of pre-diagnosis weight in analyses. A 
third of the California population are KP members; members represent the underlying 
population except at socioeconomic extremes24. Approximately 5% of patients were missing 
at-diagnosis BMI data in a year. Loss to follow-up was <3%. 49.7% of study participants 
were female and 50.3% male. A waiver of written informed consent was obtained and the 
study was approved by the KPNC institutional review board.
Data Collection
Body mass index—Height and weight were measured by a medical assistant at each 
medical visit. BMI was computed in kilograms per height in meter squared. Patients were 
included in analyses if they had a recorded BMI <6 months of a CRC diagnosis prior to 
surgery. BMI closest to the diagnosis date (range -5.3 to 6.0 months, median=0.0 mo) was 
used in analyses of at-diagnosis BMI. BMI measured ≥9 months before CRC diagnosis 
(range 9.0-68.9 months prior, median=-12.5 mo) was used to assess pre-diagnosis BMI, and 
BMI measured approximately fifteen months following diagnosis (range 9.0-27.0 months, 
median=14.7 mo), post-treatment, was used to assess post-diagnosis BMI.
We initially categorized BMI using World Health Organization (WHO) categories25. 
However, the optimal weight for CRC patients is unknown and large BMI categories may 
obscure risk in the case of U- or J-shaped relationships, so we categorized BMI into finer 
categories (<18.5, 18.5-<23, 23-<25, 25-<28, 28-<30, 30-<35, and 35+) consistent with 
those used in a recent meta-analysis of weight and mortality26, and to distinguish risks for 
lower (18.5-<23 kg/m2) and upper (23-<25 kg/m2) normal-weight, as well as lower (25-<28 
kg/m2) and upper (28-<30 kg/m2) overweight.

 Clinical variables and endpoints—KPNC Cancer Registry data and the EMR were 
reviewed for information on prognostic factors, including disease stage, tumor 
characteristics, surgical procedures, and treatment (chemotherapy, radiation therapy). Data 
on overall and CRC-specific mortality were obtained from the KPNC computerized 
mortality file, which is comprised of data from the California State Department of Vital 
Statistics, U.S. Social Security Administration, and KPNC utilization data sources. 
Colorectal cancer death was attributed to persons if CRC was listed as a cause of death on 
the death certificate.
Other covariate data—EMR data were accessed for information on numerous potential 
confounders including demographics (self-reported race is included in the EMR) and 
smoking status. The Charlson index was used to measure (any vs. no) comorbidity. Physical 
activity data (minutes per week of moderate or vigorous activity) were available in 22% of 
the population.
Statistical analysis
We used analysis of covariance to examine linear covariates by categories of at-diagnosis 
BMI adjusted for age. For categorical variables, we examined covariate distributions by 
categories of at-diagnosis BMI.
We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine associations between BMI 
at the time of, and following diagnosis, and all-cause and CRC-specific mortality. For 
analyses of at-diagnosis BMI, time was computed from time of diagnosis. In analyses of 
post-diagnosis BMI, time was computed from the time of the follow-up BMI measure to 
time of event or study end.
To address possible reverse causality, we evaluated associations in those with stage I cancer. 
Typically, researchers eliminate deaths occurring early after measurement of a risk factor. 
Though this can lead to collider bias20, this strategy is commonly used so we nonetheless 
conducted sensitivity analyses eliminating deaths occurring within the first six months and 
the first year to facilitate comparison to other studies.
Potential confounding variables in models were selected based on subject matter expertise 
encoded in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)27, diagrams that help elucidate the causal 
structure relating variables under study. We compared models controlling for age, race, and 
sex, to those adjusted additionally for stage, grade, cancer site (colon; distal or proximal, and 
rectal), smoking, and physical activity. To address concerns about the potential for collider 
bias because of the restriction of analyses to diagnosed CRC patients (Supplementary 
eFigure 1), we adjusted for pre-diagnosis BMI when evaluating the effects of both at- and 
post-diagnosis BMI. Adjustment for chemotherapy and radiation were not suggested by the 
DAG in the analysis of at-diagnosis BMI based on the time order of covariates. We 
nonetheless included these variables in models based on convention; adjustment had no 
substantive effect on associations. We considered adjustment for comorbidity but sought to 
avoid overadjustment since CRC and comorbidities have mechanisms in common related to 
BMI.

 We used both standard WHO25, and expanded, BMI categories. We also examined possible 
nonlinear relationships between BMI and survival, nonparametrically, and by sex, with 
restricted cubic splines28, a technique enabling specification of a relationship between two 
variables when the function is nonlinear. Tests for nonlinearity used the likelihood ratio test, 
comparing the model with the linear term to one with linear and cubic spline terms.
Finally, we conducted analyses of at-diagnosis BMI and outcomes, stratified in separate 
analyses by sex, age (<65 vs. ≥65 years), race, stage, comorbidity, treatment status, CRC 
site, and weight loss status between diagnosis and post-diagnosis. Heterogeneity in 
associations in stratified analyses were examined via introduction of cross-product terms for 
BMI categories and stratification variables in regression models and evaluation of 
significance with likelihood ratio χ2 tests. We conducted sensitivity analyses restricting to 
the population with complete information on pre-diagnosis BMI. We also conducted tests of 
proportionality with variable by time interactions. Tests of statistical significance were two-
sided. Significant results denote p-values≤0.05.
Results
Of the 3,408 CRC patients, 617 died (411 from CRC), with follow-up ranging from 0-8.7 
years, with a median 4.5 years follow-up. For analyses of post-diagnosis BMI and mortality 
(N=3,157), 482 died (317 from CRC), and follow-up ranged from 0-7.9 years, with a median 
3.5 years follow-up.
Baseline characteristics
Examining covariates, age was inversely associated with at-diagnosis BMI. Women were 
more likely to be underweight, normal weight, and class II/III obese, compared with men. 
Asians were more likely to be underweight or normal-weight; Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics 
were more likely to be class II/III obese. Those with stages II and III cancers were more 
likely to be underweight or normal weight compared with those with stage I cancer. 
However, those with stage III cancer were more likely to be obese (BMI≥30 kg/m2) than 
those with earlier stage cancer. Predictably, levels of smoking and physical activity were 
higher in underweight and normal-weight patients. Distal cancers were more common 
among obese patients; those with BMI<25 kg/m2 were more likely to have proximal colon 
or rectal cancers. Underweight and class II/III obese patients were less likely to receive 
chemotherapy (Table 1).
BMI and all-cause mortality
Using WHO criteria, in models adjusted for age, sex, and race, at-diagnosis BMI was 
associated with all-cause and CRC-specific mortality in a nonlinear fashion, with 
underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) and class II/III obese (BMI≥35 kg/m2) patients exhibiting 
elevated, and overweight (BMI 25-<30 kg/m2) patients showing reduced, mortality risks, 
compared with normal-weight (BMI 18.5-<25 kg/m2) patients. Mortality risks of class I 
obese and normal-weight patients were similar. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, 
associations were similar though the association for overall mortality in overweight patients 
was somewhat attenuated (Table 2). After comorbidity adjustment, the association between

 class II/III obesity and all-cause mortality was no longer significant (HR=1.27, 95% CI: 
0.88-1.84).
Using expanded BMI categories, in models adjusted for age, sex, and race, at-diagnosis BMI 
was also associated with all-cause and CRC-specific mortality in a nonlinear fashion. 
Multivariable-adjusted results were qualitatively similar (Table 2). Underweight (BMI<18.5 
kg/m2, hazard ratio [HR]=2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.63-4.31) and class II/III 
obese (BMI≥35 kg/m2, HR=1.33, 95% CI:0.89-1.98) patients exhibited elevated mortality 
risks; high-normal-weight (BMI 23-<25 kg/m2, HR=0.77, 95% CI:0.56-1.06), low-
overweight (BMI 25-<28 kg/m2, HR=0.75, 95% CI:0.55-1.04), and high-overweight (BMI 
28-<30 kg/m2, HR=0.52, 95% CI:0.35-0.77) patients showed reduced mortality risks; and 
class I obese (BMI 30-<35 kg/m2) patients showed no difference in risk, compared with low-
normal-weight (BMI 18.5-<23 kg/m2) patients. Mortality risk did not differ comparing high-
normal-weight and low-overweight patients (Wald χ2=0.03, p=0.87).
In spline analyses of all-cause mortality, risk was lowest among CRC patients with a 
BMI=28 kg/m2 (Figure 1), evident in men (eFigure 2) and women (eFigure 3). Tests for 
linear trend suggested linear relationships of BMI with mortality hazard overall (p=0.01) and 
women (p=0.01) but not in men (p=0.21). In all cases, spline analyses provided evidence of 
a nonlinear component (p<0.001 for nonlinear association [men, p<0.001; women, p=0.02].
Patterns of associations of post-diagnosis (Table 3) BMI and all-cause mortality were similar 
to results for at-diagnosis BMI and all-cause mortality. However, class I obese patients had a 
lower mortality risk, and class II/III obese patients showed no higher mortality risk 
compared with low normal-weight patients.
BMI and CRC-specific mortality
Associations of both at-diagnosis and post-diagnosis BMI with CRC-specific mortality were 
similar to those for analyses of all-cause mortality. However, in post-diagnosis analyses, 
class I obese patients had a significantly lower mortality risk and class II/III obese patients 
showed no higher and a possibly lower mortality risk compared with the reference (Tables 
2-3).
Stratified analyses
In stratified analyses, there were few differences by age, race, sex, stage, comorbidity, 
treatment, or weight loss status (Table 4, eTable 1). However, there was strong evidence of 
statistical interaction by primary tumor site. The nonlinear pattern of BMI and mortality was 
apparent in all sites, but elevated risks for underweight and class II/III obesity were most 
evident in proximal cases whereas reduced risks for overweight and class I obese were most 
evident in distal and rectal cancers cases (p-interaction=0.005) (Table 4).
In sensitivity analyses excluding early deaths, we noted little qualitative change or 
attenuation in associations for at-diagnosis weight and mortality. Associations for 
underweight and mortality in post-diagnosis analyses were somewhat attenuated when we 
excluded first year deaths, but other associations were similar (data not shown). Results in

 sensitivity analyses were also similar (data not shown). With stratification on grade, 
proportional hazards assumptions were met.
Discussion
Consistent with hypotheses, CRC patients who were underweight or class II/III obese at 
diagnosis had worse overall prognosis than normal-weight patients. By contrast, neither all-
cause nor disease-specific mortality were elevated for class II/III obese CRC patients >1 
year after diagnosis. Overweight patients consistently had the best prognosis, with the lowest 
risks of all-cause and CRC-specific mortality, though the mortality risks of low-overweight 
and high-normal-weight CRC patients did not differ. We were able to overcome limitations 
of previous studies with the availability of a complete CRC patient population, prospectively 
measured pre-diagnosis weight data, and methods which may improve causal claims 
regarding the effects of BMI on post-CRC-diagnosis mortality. These findings, in the largest 
CRC cohort to date with data on weight prior to, at the time of, and following diagnosis, 
provide support that overweight does not confer an increased mortality risk, and may 
support an obesity paradox, in CRC patients.
Previous investigators have generally shown that underweight and class II/III obese CRC 
patients have a higher mortality risk when BMI is assessed prior to13, 29, 30 or near the time 
of10-12, 14, 31 diagnosis. Risks for underweight are higher than for other patients. Our 
findings are generally consistent with these, though we found elevated mortality risks for 
underweight patients at all timepoints, in contrast with previous findings showing 
diminished effects in post-diagnosis analyses. Consistent with our findings, several though 
not all previous studies have shown lower overall and/or disease-specific mortality risks in 
overweight18, 30, 32, 33, and even mildly obese33, CRC patients when BMI has been 
evaluated after diagnosis. However, results from these analyses have been a source of 
concern among researchers interested in causal methods who have argued that inverse 
associations are due to collider bias21, 34.
With sufficient covariate adjustment, including pre-diagnosis BMI, we found robust 
evidence that prognosis is best in CRC patients who are overweight at, and after, the time of 
diagnosis. In this study, overweight CRC patients had a lower mortality risk among stage I 
patients, whether or not we eliminated early mortality, and among those with or without 
weight loss, suggesting results were not attributable to reverse causality. Our strong inverse 
findings for overweight and both all-cause and disease-specific mortality are novel, obtained 
using improved methodologies.
A lack of association of overweight around diagnosis and outcomes in previous studies may 
be due to small sample sizes11, 17, 32 and to broad categorization of weight groups; most 
studies have defined normal-weight CRC patients with BMI 18.5-<25 kg/m2, though some 
omit lower normal-weight patients in this category10, 11, 14, 15. Our findings, including a 
nonsignificant inverse association in overweight patients with similar categorization, but 
strong inverse findings in all other analyses, suggest that traditional BMI categories are 
insufficiently granular to understand mortality risk in CRC patients since the nature of the 
relationship appears convincingly nonlinear. Intriguingly, some studies with long (median≥8

 years) follow-up have shown weak, significant or borderline significant positive findings of 
overweight and mortality10, 12. However, hazard ratios of approximately 1.0 suggest that 
these estimates are influenced by the tail at the high end of the BMI distribution or that they 
might represent time-averaged effects of being overweight and/or obese on patients 
outcomes with increasing risks further from diagnosis. Long-term studies of BMI and CRC 
survival, with regularly updated BMI measures, are needed.
By examining associations in a population unaffected by sample selection bias and using 
causal methods to address confounding, we provide support that results are biologically 
meaningful. In the context of disease, overweight may confer survival benefits35-48, 
attributed to better nutritional status36, more optimal medical treatment49, greater endothelial 
progenitor cells50, lower thromboxane production51, higher ghrelin sensitivity52, and lower 
concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α53, 54. CRC patients with extra weight may have 
greater muscle and fat mass enabling them to cope with the metabolic demands of tumor 
progression and treatment49-54. However, though mortality was lowest in the overweight, 
risk was similarly low in high-normal-weight patients, suggesting that a BMI in this range 
may minimize the risks entailed in managing disease.
A study strength was the ability to examine prospectively measured weight at, and following 
diagnosis, with outcomes, adjusted for pre-diagnosis BMI. Other study strengths include a 
large sample size, data on treatment and comorbidities, weights and height measured by a 
medical assistant, and follow-up to 8.7 years. Study limitations include lack of physical 
activity data for the full cohort. However, adjustment for this variable did not affect results in 
the subset with these data (data not shown). As with all observational studies, residual 
confounding is possible. We were unable to control for detailed treatment information. 
However, Glymour found that the level of unmeasured confounding would have to be very 
large to explain the obesity paradox55 and covariate adjustment in our study had little 
influence on associations.
In summary, extremes in weight at diagnosis were associated with elevated all-cause and 
CRC-specific mortality in a large population of stage I-III CRC patients. By contrast, 
overweight CRC patients had the best prognosis. Studies are needed to understand the 
mechanisms underlying these results, particularly studies of body composition. Though 
strong scientific evidence shows that exercise in cancer patients should be encouraged, 
findings suggest, among overweight CRC patients, that recommendations for weight loss in 
the immediate post-diagnosis period may be unwarranted.

**Note: Adjustment for comorbidity attenuated the association of those with BMI 35+ for all-cause mortality to HR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.88-1.84 and for other cause mortality in analyses (data not shown).

*Models adjusted for age (continuous), sex, and race (White (ref), Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Other), stage (I (ref), II, III), grade (1, 2 (ref), 3, 4), chemotherapy (no (ref), yes), radiation (no 
(ref), yes), and disease site (proximal (ref), distal, rectal), smoking (never (ref), past, current), physical activity (0, >0 to <120, 120+ minutes/wk), and pre-diagnosis BMI (<18.5, 18.5-<23 (ref), 23-<25, 25-
<28, 28-<30, 30-<35, 35+ kg/m2) though models were not adjusted for the stratification variable.
**p-value, Likelihood Ratio χ2 test for interaction
†There were no significant differences in analyses stratified by age (< vs. ≥65 years) (p-value, test for interaction=0.83), race (p=0.18), comorbidity status (p=0.64), chemotherapy (p=0.41) or radiotherapy 
(p=0.63).
