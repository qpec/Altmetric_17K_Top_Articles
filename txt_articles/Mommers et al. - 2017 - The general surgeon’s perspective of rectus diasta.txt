Abstract
Background Diastasis of the rectus abdominis muscles
(DRAM) is characterised by thinning and widening of the
linea alba, combined with laxity of the ventral abdominal
musculature. This causes the midline to ‘‘bulge’’ when intra-
abdominal pressure is increased. Plastic surgery treatment
for DRAM has been thoroughly evaluated, though general
surgical treatments and the efficacy of physiotherapy remain
elusive. The aim of this systematic literature review is to
evaluate both general surgical and physiotherapeutic treat-
ment options for restoring DRAM in terms of postoperative
complications, patient satisfaction, and recurrence rates.
Method MEDLINE�, Embase, PubMed, PubMed Cen-
tral�, The cochrane central registry of controlled trials
(CENTRAL), Google Scholar, and the Physiotherapy
Evidence Database (PEDro) were searched using the fol-
lowing terms: ‘rectus diastasis’, ‘diastasis recti’, ‘midline’,
and ‘abdominal wall’. All clinical studies concerning
general surgical or physiotherapeutic treatment of DRAM
were eligible for inclusion.
Result Twenty articles describing 1.691 patients (1.591
surgery/100 physiotherapy) were included. Surgical inter-
ventions were classified as plication techniques (313 patients;
254 open/59 laparoscopic), modified hernia repair techniques
(68 patients, all open), and combined hernia & DRAM
techniques (1.210 patients; 1.149 open/40 hybrid). The
overall methodological quality was low. Plication techniques
with interrupted sutures and mesh reinforcement were
applied most frequently for DRAM repair. Open repairs were
performed in 85% of patients. There was no difference in
postoperative complications or recurrence rate after laparo-
scopic or open procedures, or between plication and modified
hernia repair techniques. Physiotherapy programmes were
unable to reduce IRD in a relaxed state. Though reduction of
IRD during muscle contraction was described.
Conclusion Both
plication-based
methods
and
hernia
repair methods are used for DRAM repair. Based on the
current literature, no clear distinction in recurrence rate,
postoperative complications, or patient reported outcomes
can be made. Complete resolution of DRAM, measured in
a relaxed state, following a physiotherapy training pro-
gramme is not described in current literature. Physiother-
apy can achieve a limited reduction in IRD during muscle
contraction, though the impact of this finding on patient
satisfaction, cosmesis, or function outcome is unclear.

Physiotherapy
Diastasis of the rectus abdominis muscles (DRAM) is
characterised by a protruding midline following an increase
in intra-abdominal pressure. The condition is characterised
by a gradual thinning and widening of the linea alba,
combined with a general laxity of the ventral abdominal
wall muscles [1]. DRAM is frequently misclassified as a
primary
ventral
hernia,
though

and Other Interventional Techniques 
 continuity of the midline and subsequent absence of a true
hernia sac is what sets DRAM apart from a ventral hernia.
DRAM is defined according to the Beer classification as an
inter-rectus distance (IRD) of 22 mm, three centimetres
above the umbilicus measured in a relaxed state [2].
DRAM occurs most frequently during pregnancy and
regresses spontaneously after childbirth in most women.
However, 12 months postpartum, 33% of women still
experience DRAM [3].
Patients with DRAM can experience similar complaints
as patients with ventral hernias, such as lower back pain,
functional, and cosmetic impairment, although DRAM
does not pose any threat of strangulation [4–6]. DRAM
repair is challenging for most general surgeons since
guidelines on indication and methods for repair do not
exist. The similarity to primary ventral hernias causes
frequent misclassification of the disease, and potential
mistreatment of DRAM. In recent years, the overall com-
plexity of evidence concerning DRAM treatment has
increased. This is due to the development and implemen-
tation of several new reconstructive techniques, combined
with heterogenous outcome measurements, heterogenous
definitions for DRAM, and the lack of high quality data.
DRAM is mostly treated conservatively, with or without
the help of a physiotherapist. If conservative therapy is
preferred, patients can be referred to a physiotherapist for
training programmes that specifically target DRAM, with
the aim of reducing IRD and improvement of quality-of-
life (QoL). Benjamin et al. evaluated the efficacy of these
training programmes in 2014, though due to the low quality
of the included studies, no conclusions could be drawn [7].
In case of severe functional or cosmetic impairment, the
patient can be referred to a plastic or general surgeon.
Patients that suffer from excess skin or want to tailor their
waistline simultaneously with DRAM repair should be
referred to a surgeon in the field of plastic and recon-
structive surgery for an abdominoplasty. Publications
describing DRAM repair in combination with abdomino-
plasty, liposuction, or other strictly plastic surgical tech-
niques are numerous. A recent review of Akram et al. in
2014 concerning abdominoplasty repairs in combination
with plication of the linea alba concluded that most evi-
dence is of low quality and RCTs are required to gain more
insight in the short- and long-term effects of these com-
bined procedures [8].
Patients with the sole diagnosis of DRAM are frequently
referred to the general surgeon. If surgical treatment is
considered, several techniques ranging from laparoscopic,
endoscopic, hybrid, and open repairs are available. Cur-
rently, there is no consensus on the preferred surgical
management of DRAM. In contrast to evidence from the
reconstructive field, a thorough literature review comparing
different surgical techniques for DRAM is noticeably
absent in general surgery. The aim of this systematic lit-
erature review is to provide insight in the general surgical
treatment options for DRAM in terms of postoperative
complications, patient satisfaction, and recurrence rates,
and to evaluate if physiotherapy is an alternative for sur-
gical intervention.
Methods
This
review
was
registered
on
PROSPERO
[No.:
CRD42016048176],andconductedaccordingtothe PRISMA
statement [9]. Before the start of the review process, the
review protocol was evaluated and approved by an indepen-
dent, external expert in the field of ventral hernia repair.
Search strategy
A structured literature search of MEDLINE�, Embase,
PubMed, PubMed Central� (PMC), The cochrane central
registry of controlled trials (CENTRAL), Google Scholar,
and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) was
performed by two independent reviewers (E.M. and
A.A.O.) using the following terms:
‘Diastasis recti’ OR ‘rectus diastasis’ OR ‘diastasis of
the rectus abdominis’ OR ‘diastasis of the recti’ OR ‘ab-
dominal diastasis’ OR ‘abdominal separation’ OR ‘diasta-
sis recti abdominis’ OR ‘separation of the recti’ OR
‘separation of the rectus abdominis’ OR ‘divarication of
the recti’ OR ‘divarication the rectus abdominis’ (See
Table 1 for PubMed search algorithm).
The last search was performed on 8 September 2016.
The search was performed using validated methods of the
Cochrane collaboration [10]. Both medical subject heading
(MeSH) terms and free-text terms were used to construct
the search algorithm. To create a sensitive algorithm, only
one domain of search terms (DRAM population) was used.
In addition to the above-mentioned database searches, all
reference lists of included studies were cross-referenced to
retrieve additional articles eligible for inclusion. In case of
disagreement between the reviewers regarding the eligi-
bility for inclusion of an article, the study quality, or the
data abstraction, a third reviewer (NB) was consulted for
arbitration.
Outcome definition and study selection criteria
The primary outcome for surgical studies was recurrence
rate, secondary outcomes were complication rate within
30 days, and patient satisfaction.
The primary outcome for physiotherapy studies was the
effect of the treatment on IRD, secondary outcomes were
were patient satisfaction, and recurrence rate.

 Physiotherapy studies reporting the effect of a single
exercise, performed only once, on IRD were considered as
functional anatomy studies; these studies were not included
in this systematic review. Physiotherapy studies focussing
on rectus diastasis during pregnancy or during the imme-
diate postpartum period (B24 h after childbirth) are not
included in this review since results obtained during this
period cannot be translated to a later time point, and
therefore, do not provide an answer to the secondary end-
point of this review.
Any study (comparative, non-comparative, randomised,
or observational studies) describing the effect of a surgical
or physiotherapy intervention for DRAM in at least one
patient C18 years old and reporting on the primary and/or
secondary outcome of this systematic literature review was
eligible for inclusion, with the exclusion of plastic surgery
interventions such as abdominoplasty or liposuction. No
limitations to subjects, type of article, or language were
applied, though articles published before 1975 which
described techniques that have not been applied or
described since 1975 were excluded. Articles reporting on
the treatment of DRAM combined with primary ventral
midline hernias were included, yet analysed separately.
Quality assessment
The quality of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was
evaluated using a 14-item modified Jadad score and the
Cochrane risk of bias tool [11, 12]. The quality of non-
randomised clinical studies was evaluated using the
methodological index for non-randomised studies (MIN-
ORS) criteria [13]. In case of missing data for the quality
assessment tool or data abstraction, the first and corre-
sponding author of the study was contacted via email for
completion of the missing data. If the author did not
respond, a reminder was sent after two weeks. Studies
which scored below three on the MINORS checklist were
excluded due to lack of critical data needed for correct
interpretation
of
the
results,
combined
with
an
unacceptable risk of bias, as at least six of eight domains of
the MINORS checklist are either not reported, or partially
reported in those publications.
Data abstraction
Data abstraction was performed in duplicate by two inde-
pendent reviewers (E.M. and A.A.O.) with a standardised
electronic data extraction form including but not limited to
the following study variables: title, source, year of publi-
cation, study design incl. retrospective or prospective
design, demographics of study population, sample size,
type of rectus diastasis according to Nahas et al., descrip-
tion of intervention, type of analysis (intention to treat vs
per protocol), complications within and after 30 days
postoperative, follow-up period, follow-up assessment tool,
risk factors for recurrence, and recurrence rate [14]. The
Nahas classification defines four different aesthetic types of
DRAM: Type A, DRAM secondary to pregnancy; Type B,
DRAM and laxity of the lateral and infra-umbilical
aponeurosis; Type C, congenital lateral insertion of the
rectus abdominis muscles; and Type D, DRAM combined
with poor waistline.
Results
After screening 3.689 citations and removal of 20 duplicate
manuscripts, 37 articles were selected for full-text review
(Fig. 1). Seventeen articles did not meet the inclusion cri-
teria. Twenty studies describing a total of 1.691 patients,
1.591 (94 males, 1497 females) in general surgical tech-
niques and 100 (all female) in physiotherapy training
programmes, were included in this systematic review.
Fourteen articles described surgical techniques, and six
described
physiotherapy
interventions
(Table 1).
Five
articles were written in Russian, and one in Italian. The
included surgical techniques were divided into three cate-
gories: (1) plication techniques for DRAM repair, (2)

 hernia repair techniques modified for DRAM repair, and
(3) techniques for DRAM associated with small midline
hernias.
Surgery
Plication techniques
Six retrospective studies described a surgical technique that
included plication of the midline, anterior, or posterior
rectus fascia, whilst maintaining the myofascial continuity
of the ventral abdominal wall [15–20]. A total of 313
patients were included in this section. Four studies were
case series, and two were case reports (Table 2). Quality of
the included studies was low–to-moderate with MINORS
scores ranging from 4 to 7.
Techniques
Four studies used a laparoscopic plication technique
(Fig. 2A). All laparoscopic studies used mesh reinforce-
ment, of which three used interrupted sutures, and one used
a continuous suture. The study of Palanivelu et al.
describes a technique in which they place interrupted
sutures which run in and out of the widened linea alba
several times, causing the midline to fold like a ‘Venetian
blind’ when the sutures are tied [19]. The difference in
suture technique did not lead to a difference in recurrence
rate, which were 0% in all the laparoscopic repair groups
after a follow-up ranging from 6 to 24 months.
Three studies used an open technique, and all plicated a
different layer of the ventral abdominal wall (Fig. 2B)
[16–18]. The study of Nahas et al. included two female
patients with a recurrent DRAM, and is the only study in
this section that did not use mesh reinforcement. They
describe two type C (congenital lateral implantation of the
rectus abdominis muscle) DRAM patients that had under-
gone
plication
of
the
anterior
rectus
fascia
during
abdominoplasty surgery and were operated using an open
plication technique of the posterior rectus fascia [18]. The
anterior rectus fascia was then sutured to the midline, to
mimic the anatomic situation. The other two ‘open’ studies
described either a plication technique of the anterior rectus
fascia or solely the widened linea alba, combined with a
sublay mesh.

 Results of plication techniques
Postoperative complications were reported in five studies.
Three studies observed postoperative pain, two of which
report an incidence of around 10%. The study of Sahoo
et al. clearly shows a surplus of soft tissue clustered at the
midline as a direct result of the laparoscopic plication [15].
One of the six studies reported a recurrence after open
plication. The original article does not describe recur-
rences, instead they describe that three patients experi-
enced laxity of the abdominal wall with protrusion, forcing
them to wear an abdominal binder. These patients were
interpreted as having a recurrent DRAM.
Modified hernia repair techniques
Two articles used a (modified) hernia repair technique in
DRAM patients (Table 2) [21, 22]. The first study from
Angio et al. included twelve patients with a midline
diastasis and performed a modified Chevrel technique
(Fig. 2C) [21]. The modified technique leaves the mus-
culofascial continuity of the ventral abdominal wall intact
as the abdominal cavity or the posterior rectus fascia is not
opened. Instead, the anterior rectus fascia is incised and
overturned to form a wider new posterior rectus fascia.
The wident midline is not incised.
The second study of Gireev et al. described a meshless
modification of the Rives–Stoppa repair in which the
hernia sac is excised and the posterior rectus fascia is
sutured using an overlapping plasty. The anterior rectus
fascia is then closed [22]. Quality of both studies was 8/16
and 3/16, respectively. The population described by Gireev
et al. in the 1997 publication was identical to the popula-
tion in two prior publications of their group, from 1983
and 1994 [23, 24]. These three publications were com-
bined in one reference and included only once in this
review.
Results of hernia repair techniques
The study of Angio et al. described seroma formation in
7% of their population. The study of Gireev et al. only
reported nine short-term complications, though did not
specify these complications in their manuscripts [22]. Both
studies had a follow-up of 24 months and observed no
recurrences.
Techniques for combined repair of DRAM
and small midline hernia
Six studies, of which five retrospective case series and one
prospective cohort study, described surgical treatments for
DRAM associated with small midline hernias (Table 2)

 [6, 25–29]. The total number of patients in this section was
1.210. Quality of the included studies was low-to-moderate
as one studies scored 11/16 and the remaining MINORS
scores ranged from 3 to 5.
Two studies included both umbilical and epigastric
hernias. Four studies included small umbilical hernias.
Hernia repair in five out of six studies consisted of suture
closure of the hernia sac combined with mesh reinforce-
ment. The oldest study (1990), of Ranney et al., describes a
modified Rives–Stoppa repair without mesh reinforcement.
Four studies described open techniques, mostly resembling
either
modifed
Chevrel
or
Rives–Stoppa
procedures
(Fig. 2C, D respectively). One described an endoscopic
procedure in the anatomical plane between the subcuta-
neous fat and the anterior rectus fascia, with plication of
the midline and onlay mesh reinforcement. One described a
hybrid version in the same plane, which resembled a
modified Chevrel repair, performed partially endoscopic,
with onlay mesh reinforcement.
Results of combined repair DRAM and midline hernia
Five of the six studies reported on postoperative compli-
cations [6, 25–28]. Two of these studies encountered no
postoperative complications, and the remaining three
encountered only minor (Clavien-Dindo I–II) postoperative
complications. The majority of minor complications were
seromas, with an incidence ranging from 2.5%, reported by
Ko
¨ckerling et al. to 23%, reported by Bellido et al. [6, 26].
Follow-up was only reported in two studies and ranged
from 20 months to 14.8 years. Only one recurrence was
observed during the follow-up in the study of Privett et al.
in a patient with a combined DRAM and umbilical hernia
[28]. They mentioned that open repair with preperitoneal
placement of mesh without approximation of the rectus
fascia (resembling a bridged repair) leads to fluctuating
cosmetic results, since protrusion of DRAM may still be
present after mesh placement.
Physiotherapy
Six studies evaluated the effect of a physiotherapy inter-
vention on IRD in a total of one hundred postpartum
women. Two RCTs, two prospective uncontrolled trials,
and two case reports were included in this section (Table 3)
[5, 30–34]. All studies focussed on females at different
postpartum intervals, ranging from one month to three
years. Scientific quality of the included studies was mod-
erate with MINORS scores ranging from six to nine for the
non-randomised studies, and a Jadad score of 7–11 for the
included RCTs. See Table 4 for results of The Cochrane
risk of bias tool.
Training programme
One case study used a single exercise (prone kneeling) to
train the patients [33]. Two studies used general (not fur-
ther specified) strengthening exercises for the abdominal
wall, hip, and trunk muscles [5, 32]. The remaining three
studies used the head lift exercise, combined with pelvic
lock or pelvic tilt exercises [30, 31, 34].
Frequency of the training programme varied between
the studies. One study let patients train on their own and
the frequency of the exercise during the training pro-
gramme is not reported [33]. The remaining studies used
counselling of a physiotherapist to train patients in allo-
cated training sessions. Frequency of the programmes

 varies from one time per week, to five times per week. The
total number of sessions patients had to participate ranged
from 4 to 40 sessions.
Outcome measurement
Five out of six studies included IRD as an outcome
parameter. IRD was measured with a total of four different
instruments (ultrasound, tape measure, palpation, and dial
caliper). Three studies assessed IRD with two instruments
simultaneously [31, 32, 34]. Overall, three studies used
palpation as measurement for IRD, two studies combined
palpation with tape measurement, or dial caliper mea-
surement. One study used only tape measurement [33], and
one used only palpation [30]. Two studies did not report if
the IRD measurement took please during muscle contrac-
tion or relaxation. The remaining three studies reporting on
IRD all measured IRD during muscle contraction. Four of
the five studies measuring IRD reported the location of
IRD measurement. One study measured at the umbilicus,
two studies measured two centimetres above and below the
umbilicus, and one measured four-and-a-half centimetres
above and below the umbilicus.
Results of physiotherapy training programme
Five out of six studies reported IRD as outcome mea-
surement. Follow-up in all studies was performed directly
after the training programmes ended. Hence, follow-up
ranged from 2 weeks to 4 months. Five articles reported
IRD as their primary outcome and all reported a decrease
of IRD during the exercise programme. Both case reports
describe IRD values below 22 mm during muscle con-
traction, after completion of the training programme.
The article of Emanuelsson et al. measured QoL using
the SF-36 questionnaire and report that 87% (n = 26) of
the patients were unsatisfied with the results of their
training therapy and opted for surgical intervention after
completion of the training programme.
Discussion
Diastasis of the rectus abdominis muscles is a common
problem. If not treated as part of an abdominoplasty in the
field of plastic and reconstructive surgery, there is a lack of
consensus on the preferred treatment of DRAM. Apart
from conservative therapy, operative intervention and
physiotherapy are the most frequently reported treatments
for DRAM. This review provides an overview of the results
of these interventions.
The overall quality of the included studies was low-to-
moderate, combined with limited scientific power since
only five prospective studies were included, of which two
were RCTs. For this reason, meta-analysis of the included
studies was deemed unfit. As stipulated by the review of
Hickey et al. in 2011, indication for DRAM repair has
different considerations compared to ventral hernia repair,
despite the clinical similarity between the two entities [35].
Indication for DRAM repair is most often based on
Table 4 Cochrane risk of bias tool results

123
 cosmetic or functional impairment, as DRAM poses no risk
of strangulation. Therefore, the cosmetic results of a sur-
gical technique or physiotherapy training programme,
along with other patient reported outcomes (PROs), should
be an important outcome of scientific studies. Remarkably,
cosmetic outcome was only included in one study, and
measured subjectively with an instrument that was not
validated. Other PROs were not measured in surgical
publications and only reported twice in physiotherapy
studies.
Surgical technique
Based on the published literature, the surgical techniques
available for DRAM repair are either plication-based or
hernia repair-based. The plication-based techniques include
open plication, laparoscopic plication, or hybrid plication
of either the anterior or posterior rectus fascia. Based on
the results of this review, there is no clear difference in
postoperative
complications
between
these
methods.
Nearly all studies that described a plication technique used
interrupted sutures and mesh reinforcement, which could
account for the low recurrence rates, though comparative
data are not available. The plication techniques can leave a
surplus of skin directly after surgery, as described in the
study of Sahoo et al., though due to the lack of cosmetic
outcome
measurement
no
evidence-based
statements
regarding the cosmetic postoperative appearance can be
made [15].
Hernia repair techniques can be used for DRAM treat-
ment.
The
musculofascial
continuity
of
the
ventral
abdominal wall is an important anatomical structure to be
considered during DRAM repair. If the midline is incised
and the continuity is disturbed, the risk of incisional hernia
formation and subsequent risk of strangulation will become
larger, though alignment of the rectus muscles could be
easier. The current evidence is of insufficient quality to
detect differences between techniques that preserve the
musculofascial continuity versus techniques that incise the
midline. Hernia-based techniques for DRAM repair are
often modifications of the original Chevrel or Rives–
Stoppa techniques [21, 36, 37].
An important reason for DRAM patients to seek medical
attention is the cosmetic impairment they experience.
Despite the importance of cosmetic results, the majority
(85% of patients) of published literature in general surgery
for DRAM concerns open procedures. Recently developed
hybrid techniques such as the ELAR plus described by
Ko
¨ckerling et al., the endoscopic midline plication by
Bellido et al., or the eMILOS by Reinpold et al. could
increase the number of minimally invasive procedures in
the DRAM population [6, 26, 38]. These procedures are
promising
variations
of
classic
(open)
hernia
repair
techniques that respect the anatomical myofascial conti-
nuity of the ventral abdominal wall, and leave only mini-
mal scarring, without risk of incisional hernia formation
because the abdominal cavity is not opened. Given the
recent invention of these techniques, the amount of pub-
lished data is limited and with short follow-up. The study
of Reinpold et al. unfortunately had to be excluded since
the article did not describe critical data about the study
methodology or the population [38]. Nevertheless, the
technique seems to be promising for DRAM treatment.
It was not possible to isolate any difference in outcome
between male and female patients of the included studies
due to quality and reporting limitations of the included
studies. It is the author’s opinion that the pathophysiology
between males and females, or between type A/B and type
C/D DRAM is different. The A/B type DRAM may be
based on a physiological response during pregnancy, when
collagen is remodelled under the influence of the hormone
‘relaxin’ to allow widening or strentching of the midline
that is not corrected properly after pregnancy [39, 40]. In
males, or type C/D DRAM, genetic predisposition or
altered collagen 1:3 ratio’s may have a more pronounced
role.
Physiotherapy
The literature regarding physiotherapy interventions is
heterogeneous in nature and of low quality. The type of
exercises used to reduce IRD, the frequency of the exer-
cises, the total number of sessions within a training pro-
gramme, and the instruments used to asses IRD vary
greatly amongst the included studies. For instance, the case
study of Litos et al. informed their patient to avoid
abdominal exercises that could increase IRD by recruit-
ment of the transverse abdominal muscles, such as sit-ups,
crunches, and rotational trunk exercises, whilst other
studies from Ramesh et al. and Walton et al. target
specifically the transverse abdominal muscles with these
exercises to reduce IRD [31, 32, 34]. The included studies
only report on postpartum women (type A, B), making
translation of the results to men and type C and D DRAM
difficult, if not impossible.
Brauman et al. has investigated the clinical anatomy of
DRAM and reported that DRAM is not only associated
with a gradual thinning and stretching of the linea alba, but
also by a laxity of the ventral abdominal musculature [1].
Considering Brauman’s findings, physiotherapy could play
a role in treating the laxity of the ventral abdominal
musculature.
Despite the potential benefits of physiotherapy, current
literature does not describe the successful treatment of
rectus diastasis nor a reduction of IRD measured in a
relaxed state. Since diastasis rectus is defined as a
4946
Surg Endosc (2017) 31:4934–4949
123
 separation of the rectus abdominis muscles as measured in
a relaxed state, we must conclude that the currently
available evidence does not describe the successful treat-
ment of rectus diastasis after a physiotherapy training
programme. Physiotherapy was able to moderately reduce
IRD during muscle contraction. The impact of these results
on quality-of-life or functional outcome is currently
unknown, as is the sustainability of these results after a
follow-up exceeding four months. Based on the study of
Emanuelsson et al., physiotherapy alone is unlikely to lead
to satisfying functional and cosmetic results [5]. Ema-
nuelsson et al. compared DRAM patients treated with a
physiotherapy training programme with patients whom
received abdominoplasty for DRAM in a randomised
controlled trial. Eighty-one percent of the patients in the
training group were unsatisfied with their functional and
cosmetic appearance at the end of the programme and
opted for surgical intervention after the trial ended.
Physiotherapy could be an alternative to surgery for
patients who are unable or reluctant to undergo surgical
intervention. Surgical treatment only corrects the widening
of the linea alba and will not influence the general laxity of
the ventral abdominal wall. Therefore, physiotherapy could
be a useful addition to surgical intervention for DRAM, to
achieve satisfying functional outcome.
limitations
Most of the included studies were performed in postpartum
women (rectus diastasis type A and B), reducing the trans-
latability to men and rectus diastasis type C and D. Most of
the included studies were retrospective and non-comparative
in nature, reducing the scientific power of the review. The
quality of the included studies according to the MINORS
criteria was low; this is in part due to the ‘how-to-do-it’ type
of publication which describes surgical techniques in sci-
entific journals. These articles only include a small popula-
tion, limiting the description of the randomisation, inclusion,
end point, and blinding methods. Moreover, the MINORS
score is sensitive for retrospective studies, as a retrospective
study will automatically lose four out of sixteen points. Due
to the low quality of the included studies, gender differences
could not be isolated from the included population. Despite
the above-mentioned limitations some general recommen-
dations and conclusions can be drawn from this review.
Considerations for DRAM treatment
DRAM is not a hernia
The continuity of the myofascial anatomy in the ventral
abdominal wall is what sets DRAM apart from an
abdominal wall hernia. There are endoscopic, hybrid, and
open techniques available that leave the anatomical
myofascial continuity intact, and could potentially protect
the DRAM patient from the risk of incisional hernia for-
mation in case of a failed repair. Whether these techniques
have any cosmetic or functional advantage over traditional
hernia repair techniques, and if there is indeed no risk of
incisional hernia formation, is currently unclear.
Align and use mesh
For the repair of DRAM (without midline hernia), plication
techniques
with
mesh
reinforcement
and
interrupted
sutures are most frequently used to reconstruct the ventral
abdominal wall. Only using mesh reinforcement without an
approximation of the rectus fascia of some sort, may lead
to unsatisfying cosmetic results. Other minimally invasive,
hybrid, or open techniques are promising and can be used,
though long-term results and comparative controlled data
are not available.
Evaluate what is important for the patient
The current body of evidence focuses primarily on recur-
rence rates. It is well known that the risk of recurrence is
not the most important variable for the patient. Instead,
PROs such as postoperative pain, cosmetic outcome, and
functional result are variables that directly concern the
patients’ wellbeing. The use of PROs is low in both hernia-
and DRAM-related research, and should be increased
during the coming years [41].
Cosmetic outcome is important
Cosmetic impairment is an important factor for DRAM
patients to seek medical attention. Therefore, cosmetic
result of a surgical intervention is of high importance in the
DRAM population. Which surgical procedure (endoscopic,
hybrid, laparoscopic, or open) has the most satisfying
cosmetic outcome is not yet evaluated.
Consider physiotherapy
Physiotherapy is unlikely to completely treat DRAM, since
cases in which IRD was reduced to normal during a relaxed
state are currently not described in literature. However, a
moderate reduction in IRD during muscle contraction is
reported. Whether this has an influence on functional out-
comes or quality-of-life is not described. Physiotherapy
combined with surgery could potentially have favourable
results over surgery alone, this combination of treatments is
currently not investigated. Moreover, patients that are
reluctant or unable to undergo surgery may be referred to a

 physiotherapist for strengthening exercises of the abdomi-
nal wall.
Recommendations for future studies
The authors would like to recommend future studies
reporting on the efficacy of any DRAM repair to include
PROs such as cosmetic outcome, quality-of-life, and work
impairment, measured with a validated questionnaire (Eu-
raHS QoL, COMI-Hernia) as their primary outcome, and
IRD or recurrence rate as a secondary outcome. Both
should be measured using an objective tool (dial caliper or
ultrasound), as finger palpation should not be used for
scientific outcome reporting [42]. The location of mea-
surement and the cut-of value should be standardised for
patients’ age, location of measurement, and pre- or post-
partum status according to previously published classifi-
cations [2, 42–44]. IRD should be measured whilst the
rectus abdominis muscles are relaxed, as references values
of
normal
midline
width
and
DRAM
classification
are measured/based
on
measurements during
muscle
relaxation. Based on the pathophysiology described by
Brauman, the combination of physiotherapy and surgical
repair has great theoretical potential to solve both the
anatomical divarication and the laxity of the ventral
abdominal muscles [1]. The authors recommend that future
RCTs focus on the combination of surgery and physio-
therapy for the repair of DRAM.
Conclusion
Published literature on surgical treatments for rectus dias-
tasis is of low scientific and methodological quality. Both
plication-based methods and hernia repair methods are
used for DRAM repair. Based on the current literature, no
clear distinction in recurrence rate, postoperative compli-
cations, or patient reported outcomes can be made. DRAM
is most frequently repaired using plication techniques
combined with mesh reinforcement. Current literature does
not describe the successful treatment of DRAM or a
reduction of IRD in a relaxed state following physiother-
apy. Physiotherapy can achieve a moderate reduction in
IRD during muscle contraction, though it is currently
unclear if this has any positive effect on quality-of-life or
functional outcomes.
