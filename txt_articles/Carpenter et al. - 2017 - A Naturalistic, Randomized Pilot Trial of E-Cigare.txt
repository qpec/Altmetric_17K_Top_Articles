Abstract
Background: Most studies of electronic nicotine delivery sys-
tems (ENDS) compare self-selected users versus nonusers. The
few randomized studies to date generally support a positive
impact on reducing smoking behavior, but these studies are
focused on guided ENDS use. This study presents a randomized,
naturalistic trial of ENDS with prospective outcomes of uptake
and behavioral changes in smoking.
Methods: Adult smokers with minimal ENDS history were
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive product for 3 weeks (n ¼
46), or not (n ¼ 22). Changes in nicotine delivery (16 vs. 24 mg),
midway through the study allowed a compelling opportunity to
examine two ENDS products compared with the control group.
Primary outcomes, assessed via daily diaries during sampling
period and in-person laboratory visits over 4 months, included
uptake and usage of ENDS, cessation-related outcomes, and
exposure to smoke constituents.
Results: All ENDS participants tried product at least once, with
48% of 24 mg and 30% of 16 mg using their assigned product for
the entire sampling period. Within the 24 mg ENDs group, 57%
made an independent purchase of ENDS, versus 28% of 16 mg,
and 14% of control participants (P ¼ 0.01). Smokers in both
ENDS groups significantly reduced their smoking, whereas con-
trol participants did not (P ¼ 0.03). Cessation behaviors (quit
attempts, biologically verified abstinence) numerically but not
statistically favored ENDS participants.
Conclusions: Results suggest that cigarette smokers are willing
to use ENDS with trends toward reduced cigarette smoking and
positive changes in cessation-related behaviors.
Impact: Randomized, naturalistic trials such as presented
herein are needed to understand the population impact of
e-cigarettes. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(12); 1795–803.

Introduction
The proliferation of electronic nicotine delivery systems
(ENDS, or e-cigarettes) has generated a rapidly growing yet
divergent literature on how these products impact smoking
behavior (1, 2). Most studies that assess the impact of ENDS on
smoking are either cross-sectional or observational cohort designs
(3, 4). Evidence suggests that the majority of ENDS users have
intention to reduce and/or quit smoking (5), and a range of
studies have shown ENDS use to be associated with quit attempts
(6), reduction and/or cessation (7–16). More recent cohort stud-
ies further document a positive association between use and
subsequent quitting (17, 18), particularly when ENDS are
used regularly (19–21). However, not all studies have been
consistent, and some have shown negative associations with
quitting (22–25). The rapidly evolving marketplace combined
with methodological constraints across studies likely contributes
to inconsistent findings, making it difficult to draw firm conclu-
sions about the value of ENDS as a smoking cessation method. A
major barrier to study interpretation, especially from observa-
tional studies, is the reliance on self-selected samples of users
versus nonusers. This self-selection bias presents challenges when
determining causal inferences with regard to ENDS and their
impact on smoking behavior.
A more direct test of the impact of ENDS comes through
randomized controlled trials. Only four such trials exist (26–29)
and two are pending (30, 31). All but one of the existing RCTs
were based on early-generation products. The first was a study of
Italian smokers (27); randomized smokers (N ¼ 300); and high,
moderate, or placebo ENDS. Rates of abstinence after 3 months
(11%, 17%, 4% in each group, respectively) and 12 months
(13%, 9%, 4%) suggested higher quit rates among active ENDS
groups. The second study, a noninferiority, cessation-focused
trial (N ¼ 657), came from New Zealand (28, 32). Smokers were
randomized to receive (i) an early-generation ENDS product,
(ii) transdermal patch, or (iii) placebo ENDS. Abstinence rates
numerically but not statistically favored the ENDS product over

 both the nicotine patch and placebo. The third study was a
small-scale (N ¼ 48), randomized trial from Belgium that
showed short-term (2-month) increases in quitting as a func-
tion of newer-generation ENDS, which dissipated over longer-
term (8 months) follow-up (26). Finally, a recent reduction-
focused trial demonstrated significant decreases in smoking
as compared among active versus placebo ENDS (29).
Most of the aforementioned trials focused on prescribed and/or
structured e-cigarette use, that is, to reduce and/or quit smoking,
which is entirely different from real-world uptake. Naturalistic
provision of ENDS, yet still within a randomized design, allows
for assessment of self-determined use and its causal impact on
downstream smoking behavior while avoiding biases of self-
selection inherent in the observational studies. We have previ-
ously used the naturalistic, randomized clinical trial framework to
evaluate uptake, patterns, and consequences of nicotine products,
both snus (33) and cessation pharmacotherapies (NRTs; 34, 35),
and now extend this design to ENDS.
The current study presents results from a pilot (N ¼ 68) test
of short-term (3 weeks) ENDS sampling versus not, with follow-
up for an additional 3 months (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
NCT02357173). Our general aim was to approximate the real-
world scenario in which smokers are exposed to e-cigarette and
decide on their own if and how they will use them. Our specific
focus was on: (i) uptake and usage of the ENDS product during
the sampling period and beyond, (ii) smoker evaluation of
the product, (iii) changes in smoking and cessation-related out-
comes, and (iv) differences in exposure to cigarette smoke con-
stituents (i.e., cotinine, carbon monoxide, and NNAL).
Materials and Methods
Participants
Nontreatment seeking smokers were recruited from the local
community (southeastern U.S. urban area; approximately 30%
nonwhite) using various media outlets. To be eligible, partici-
pants were required to be/have: (i) age 18þ, (ii) current smoker of
�5 cigarettes per day (CPD) for �1 year, (iii) no recent history of
cardiovascular distress (heart attack in past 3 months, arrhythmia,
uncontrolled hypertension), (iv) neither pregnant nor breastfeed-
ing (verified), (v) absence of any major current psychiatric
impairment, (vi) current, active use of email, (vii) at least some
concern for health effects of smoking (>none at all on a Likert
scale), and (viii) not used any ENDS product in the past 6
months, and (ix) never purchased an ENDS product. The latter
two criteria were meant to ensure a study sample that was
relatively na€
�ve to ENDS so we could more accurately gauge how
the provision of the product in this study impacted use of the
product and smoking behaviors.
Participants eligible during phone screen were assessed and
ultimately consented during the initial in-person laboratory visit.
Randomization to group was stratified by motivation to quit in
the next 30 days (0–6 vs. 7–10 on a VAS scale) but proportioned
2:1 (ENDS:control) to increase precision estimates for e-cigarette
uptake and usage. The study consisted of two phases. An initial
3-week sampling period allowed participants to use ENDS (or
not), complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; 3x daily)
throughout, and visit the laboratory at weeks 2, 3, and 4. At week
4, daily EMA discontinued and no further product was offered.
The 3-month follow-up period consisted of laboratory visits at
weeks 8, 12, and 16. Study flow is depicted in Fig. 1.
Participants were compensated up to $346, inclusive of EMA-
contingent reimbursement. Control participants, not offered
ENDS, were offered an additional $30 to compensate for the free
product given to the ENDS group. All procedures were approved
by our local institutional review board (IRB) in accordance with
recognized ethical guidelines. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. Data collection began in Novem-
ber 2014 and continued through final follow-up in May 2016.
ENDS
Recent evidence suggests that newer-generation products based
on tank systems are better substitutes for cigarettes, as opposed to
standard cartridge or ciga-like design products (21). However, at
the time of study design, tank systems were just emerging on the
market. We also believed that new converts to ENDS would likely
start out with a standard cartridge design product instead of a tank
system, particularly in the United States where cartridge systems
are widely available and advertised in convenience stores. We thus
chose BluCig to use in our study which at the time of study onset
was the most popular product on the market (36). Also, our earlier
work that showed consumer preference for BluCig among other
ciga-like devices (37).
We offered ENDS group participants the choice of either
traditional tobacco or menthol flavor (other flavors available but
not offered to minimize methodological variance) Blu Starter
Pack, with 16 mg/mL nicotine (the highest dose available at study
initiation). Midway through the study, the manufacturer of Blu
altered the product and discontinued availability of the device,
replaced with BluPlusþ, with 24 mg/mL nicotine, again offered in
both tobacco and menthol flavorings, and with improved battery
duration (4-watt battery for both devices). In all, 25 participants
(54%) received the Blu Starter Pack (16 mg), and 21 participants
(46%) received BluPlusþ (24 mg); no switches were made within
participants. The change in product (IRB approved) allowed us
the unexpected opportunity to assess what impact, if any, the
change in product design had on study outcomes. Note that the
manufacturer, style of device, and packaging did not change, nor
did our messaging to participants. The only difference was the
strength of product. Thus, trial outcomes are reported across three
groups: control versus 16 mg versus 24 mg ENDS.
We selected a 3-week sampling period for three reasons. First,
we believed that smokers who adopt a new product are likely to
have a period of acclimation, in which they determine (i) if they
like it, and (ii) how to use it to manage cravings. Second, we
wanted a sufficiently long-time period to capture the "bookends"
of this acclimation period, inclusive of initial trial and established
use. Third, this period allowed sufficient time to observe natu-
ralistic changes in cigarette smoking. Participants were given up to
seven cartridges at each of three weekly visits (BL, visits 2 & 3)
during the sampling period. We purposefully oversupplied prod-
uct because we did not want to artificially suppress substitution.
ENDS group participants were allowed to retain any unused
product after the sampling period.
Instructions on usage were kept minimal to preserve natural-
istic intent. We simply suggested that ENDS could be used "as you
wish, to cut down or quit smoking, help manage smoking
restrictions, or both. It is entirely up to you if and how you use
this product." We provided participants with materials from the
manufacturer marketing, including messaging of (i) no ashes, (ii)
odorless, (iii) no after smell, and (iv) made in the United States.

 Assessments are structured across the four major outcomes
noted above
Uptake and usage of ENDS. We adapted EMA methods from prior
literature (38). Through our secure, encrypted, online database
(REDCap), we preprogrammed and auto-sent an email (or text
message reminders to check email) on designated diary days
(all 21 days of sampling period). Participants opened a link
within the email which took the user to a brief (2–5 minutes)
survey,
directly
entered
into
REDCap.
Participants
were
"pinged" 3x daily, at semi-random intervals. Validation checks
were embedded within each session to protect against rote
responding (e.g., "enter 4 here"); sessions with invalid data
(2%) were removed from analyses. Within each EMA session,
participants were asked about products used in the past hour
(electronic, conventional, both or none). If both products were
used, the participant was asked to reference the most recent.
Setting and context were asked for each conventional/electronic
cigarette episode. We used the final EMA entry of each day
to assess both (i) number of e-cigarette puffing episodes and
(ii) number of cigarettes smoked that day. Both measures thus
reflect partial days, which we deemed more feasible than asking
number of puffing episodes during a prior day (there is yet no
established method for EMA assessment of ENDS). Participants
were compensated for compliance (up to $6 per day for 21 days
þ $10 bonus for �80% EMA compliance). Overall compliance
was modest but no different across groups: 58% of all EMA
sessions completed.
Visit-based assessments, extending beyond the sampling peri-
od, included timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods (39) to assess
both number of cigarettes smoked each day over the preceding 7
days, and whether ENDS were used (yes/no) each day over the
same period. CPD represents an average over this 7-day period.
Product evaluation. Product evaluation was based on the Modified
Cigarette Evaluation Scale (40), asked in reference to both con-
ventional and ENDS. The mCEQ is a 12-item scale, recently
adapted for ENDS (41) with five factors: (i) enjoyment, (ii)
craving reduction, (iii) satisfaction, (iv) reward, and (v) aversion.
Changes in smoking and cessation-related behaviors. Changes in
smoking (CPD) are based on TLFB methods noted above. Ces-
sation-related behaviors included the incidence of quit attempts
(both any and those lasting �24 hours), floating abstinence
(any 7-day period of self-reported nonsmoking, ever in study)
and point prevalent abstinence (7-day nonsmoking at 4-month
follow-up), the latter verified via carbon monoxide breathalyzer
(<6 ppm). Motivation to quit (MTQ) in the next month was
assessed through 0–10 VAS used previously (42).
Biomarkers of exposure. These included urinary cotinine, carbon
monoxide, and NNAL. The latter was not included as a measure of
toxicant exposure per se (as results would be specific to chosen
product) but rather as a measure (like CO) to discriminate
between conventional versus e-cigarette exposure. Urine cotinine

 was assessed via enzyme immunoassay (DRI Cotinine Assay,
Thermo-Fisher Scientific), for which the limits of quantification
were 34 ng/mL, and the inter-assay coefficient of variation for
two controls were 3.6% and 3.0%. Urine total NNAL was mea-
sured in a separate laboratory (MLG) using UPLC-MS/MS as
described previously (43), for which the limits of quantification
were 5 pg/mL. Given skewed distribution of NNAL values, these
data were first log-transformed before analyses.
Statistical analyses
Demographic and smoking history data at baseline were com-
pared between the threegroups via ANOVA models andc2tests, as
appropriate. Analyses of e-cigarette usage, including EMA data,
were largely descriptive. Changes in biomarkers, CPD, and MTQ
were all assessed via generalized estimating equations (GEE),
testing group and time main effects and group � timeinteractions.
These analyses were primarily focused on the entire 16-week study
period. Whenever main or interaction effects were found, the
outcomes were examined separately for both the sampling (first
4 visits) and the follow-up periods (weeks 8–16). Assessment
of cessation-related behaviors (quit attempts, abstinence) fol-
lowed an intent-to-treat approach, in which all missing cases
were assumed as having no quit attempts/abstinence. These
cessation-related behavior outcomes were compared between
the three groups via c2 tests.
Results
Sample characteristics
Table 1 provides comparisons of selected demographic and
smoking history data. There were few differences between groups
at baseline. We did not include covariates in any following
analyses due to the pilot scope of our purpose. Participants were
primarily female, Caucasian (though with representative recruit-
ment of African Americans), moderately dependent, and with
moderate motivation to quit smoking.
Uptake and patterns of ENDS use
All but two ENDS participants attended at least one follow-up
visit, and we restrict uptake data to these individuals alone (not
assuming use/no use among those missing). Of these 44, all used
the e-cigarette at least once (Fig. 2). Most participants reported a
high frequency of use (based on TLFB), during the sampling
period (>5 days per week), which decreased to about 3 days per
week during follow-up. Over the 21-day sampling period, average
duration of e-cigarette use was 15.4 days (SD¼7.0) among 16 mg
ENDS participants and 17.0 (SD¼5.6) among 24 mg ENDS
participants. Just under half (48%) of 24 mg ENDS participants
used product all 21 days of the sampling period, versus 30% of 16
mg ENDS participants. Collapsing across both ENDS groups, the
only predictors of increased duration of use were greater income
(P ¼ 0.02) and nicotine dependence (P ¼ 0.04). Few control
participants (<5%) used an e-cigarette during the sampling peri-
od, though 19% reported ENDS use during follow-up (Fig. 2;

 frequency of use not shown given n ¼ 4). In the week preceding
the final study visit (week 16); 60% (24 mg), 32% (16 mg), and
13% (Control) of participants were using e-cigarettes.
Participants who received the 24-mg product were significantly
more likely to report independent purchase of an ENDS product
compared with those who received 16 mg product and those in
the control group (57% vs. 28% vs. 14%; P < 0.05). There were no
differences in purchasing between 16 mg and Control partici-
pants. There was a significant time x group interaction for inten-
tion to use e-cigarette in future, overall (P < 0.0001), both within
the sampling period (P < 0.0001) and throughout follow-up (P ¼
0.02), such that ENDS participants (both 24 mg and 16 mg)
increased in intention during the sampling period (combined
M¼5.5; SD¼3.1 at baseline vs. M¼7.0; SD¼3.1 at visit 4) whereas
control participants decreased (M¼5.4; SD¼3.3 at baseline vs.
M¼2.7; SD¼3.7 at visit 4); see Supplementary Fig. S1.
Beyond TLFB assessment at each laboratory visit, within-week
EMA data provided a more detailed account of cigarette and
e-cigarette use during the sampling period. Per-day cigarettes
smoked (based on final EMA entry each day; not a complete day)
dropped immediately upon onset of sampling period, and aver-
aged 5.3 CPD (SD¼1.1) for 24 mg ENDS, versus 8.4 CPD
(SD¼0.8) for 16 mg ENDS, versus 11.2 (SD¼0.8) for control
participants (See Supplementary Fig. S2). Number of puffing
episodes per day was generally higher early in the sampling period
among 24 mg ENDS participants (interaction P < 0.05; See
Supplementary Fig. S3). Contextual correlates of smoking versus
vaping, again based on EMA data and collapsed across all groups,
show that use of both conventional and ENDS was most common
when smoking was allowed (90% of cigarette smoking episodes
and 83% of e-cigarette episodes) and when alone (73% of
cigarette smoking episodes and 69% of e-cigarette episodes).
When the participant was smoking a conventional cigarette with
others present, these others were most likely also smoking con-
ventional cigarettes (66% vs. 6% vaping vs. 28% not using
anything). When others were present during e-cigarette episodes,
these others were less commonly but still predominantly con-
ventional smokers (59% vs. 29% vaping, vs. 12% not using
anything). Over 40% of all cigarette episodes were indoors versus
58% outdoors, in contrast to e-cigarette episodes (65% indoor vs.
35% outdoor). Alcohol co-use was slightly higher during cigarette
versus e-cigarette episodes (6% vs. 3%). The most common
settings for cigarette smoking were home (60% of all episodes),
car (18%) or another home (9%). The most common settings for
vaping were home (51% of all episodes), public area (16%), or at
work (12%).
Product evaluation
Product evaluation was asked for both conventional and
ENDS. Three analyses were conducted, all based on the mCEQ
and its adapted version for e-cigarettes: (i) control versus ENDS
(collapsed across both 16 and 24 mg ENDS) for comparison of
conventional cigarettes; (ii) conventional cigarettes versus e-cigar-
ettes, within 16mg ENDS group; and (iii) same, within the 24 mg
ENDS group. There were no differences in any of these measures at
baseline, and thus no baseline adjustment was included when
focused on outcomes at Visit 4, at the end of the sampling period.
Results are shown in Fig. 3 for all five mCEQ subscales. Though
not powered for tests of equivalence, products were generally
rated similarly, for all three comparisons. The only exception was
a significant difference within 16 mg ENDS participants, who
rated their conventional cigarettes as offering higher craving relief
than ENDS.
Changes in smoking and cessation-related behaviors
Consistent with EMA results, there was a significant time �
group interaction for changes in cigarette smoking (CPD; aver-
aged over the preceding 7 days before each laboratory visit), such
that ENDS participants (both 16 and 24 mg) decreased their
smoking, whereas control participants did not (Supplementary
Fig. S4). These results also show that smoking decreases during the

 sampling period persisted across the follow-up period. Cigarette
consumption decreased 45.1% for 24 mg ENDS participants
during the sampling weeks, versus 30.2% reduction for 16mg
ENDS participants, versus an increase of 0.7% for control parti-
cipants. At the end of the sampling period, 35% (24 mg ENDS),
30% (16 mg ENDS), and 5% (control) of participants had
reduced their smoking by at least 50% since baseline (overall
P ¼ 0.07). At the end of the entire study, respective rates of �50%
reduction were 47% versus 16% versus 19% (overall P ¼ 0.09).
There was an overall significant interaction for motivation to quit
(P ¼ 0.05), such that ENDS participants (both 16 and 24 mg)
increased in motivation to quit during the sampling period
whereas control participants did not, though they did have
comparable motivation to quit at end of study.
Cessation-related behaviors (quit attempts, floating and
point prevalence abstinence) are depicted in Fig. 4. There were
no statistically significant group comparisons across any of
these outcomes, but there were clear trends for higher rates of
all outcomes among 24 mg ENDS participants versus control
participants, particularly for incidence rates for 24 hours quit
attempts [48% vs. 23%; OR, 3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI),
0.8–11.5], and for floating abstinence (24% vs. 5%; OR, 6.7;
95% CI, 0.7–61.9).
Biomarkers of exposure
There were no group � time differences for urinary cotinine,
carbon monoxide, or NNAL (Supplementary Fig. S5). Although
these interactions were not statistically evident, some differences
were compelling. There was a 25% reduction in expired CO within
the 24 mg ENDS group by the end of the sampling period (vs. 10%
in 16 mg ENDS and 3% in control). By the end of the study,
reductions in CO were still evident: 29% versus 14% versus 12%
decrease since baseline visit.
Adverse events
During the course of the study, eleven 24 mg ENDS participants
(52%) reported a total of 21 adverse events, compared with nine
16 mg ENDS participants (36%) who reported 17 adverse events,
and compared with 8 control participants (36%) who reported a
total of 29 events. Collapsed across both ENDS groups, the most
common side effects reported were cough (32%), nausea
(24%), and mouth/throat irritation (16%), and in the control
group, headache (24%), cough (21%), and mouth/throat
irritation (17%). None of the adverse events resulted in study
termination, or, among ENDS participants, early discontinu-
ation of sampling.
Discussion
The current study presents a randomized yet naturalistic
study of ENDS, with a focus on uptake and impact of ENDS
over a 4-month period. An additional, unexpected strength
of this study is the ability to compare (nonrandomized
comparison) older versus newer e-cigarette devices, both
first-generation devices but with exclusive differences on
strength of nicotine delivery. Thus, our study affords a unique
opportunity to examine two devices that vary only in nicotine
strength (all other features constant) as compared with not
sampling anything.
Uptake of ENDS was high, and higher among those who
received newer/stronger product. All ENDS participants (both
groups) used the e-cigarette given to them. Even after the con-
clusion of the 3-week sampling period, and through to the final
study visit at 4 months, well over half of participants who were
given a newer product were still using ENDS and vaping about
half of each week. Although it is possible that participants held
over product on hand from the sampling period, it is more telling
that these same participants were significantly more likely to
purchase their own product. Unfortunately, we are unable to
determine whether they purchased the same, similar, or more
advanced ENDS. This interest in further use of product is corrob-
orated by their stated intentions on future use, which increased
over time, versus control participants whose interest in ENDS
waned. Participants generally rated cigarettes and ENDS similarly.
These results are likely product-specific, but they stand in contrast
to prior studies, similarly powered, showing favorability of cigar-
ettes over e-cigarettes (44).
The contexts of smoking versus vaping were largely similar. Use
episodes were generally bound to places or occasions where
smoking was permitted and the individual was alone. In the
presence of others, conventional smoking by that other person

 was most common, both for cigarette smoking episodes and
vaping episodes. The only contextual difference of note, not
surprising, was that vaping was largely indoors whereas conven-
tional smoking was largely outdoors. Future studies should also
include assessment of nonuse contexts that would allow for
comparisons to establish which situational factors determine use.
Changes in smoking behavior generally followed the same
patternsasabove withregard touptake.ENDSsampling,regardless
of older versus newer/stronger product, decreased cigarette smok-
ing, whether measured via daily fluctuations during the sampling
period or more robust measures (7-day weekly averages) over time
and throughout the study. More than twice as many participants
receiving 24 mg product (compared with control and 16 mg
product recipients) reduced their smoking by 50% or more by the
end of the trial. Across all cessation-related behaviors, outcomes
werenumericallybut notstatistically infavorofENDSparticipants,
particularly those receiving newer/stronger product. Although our
study was solely based on a first-generation ciga-like device, these
outcomes are consistent with a few laboratory-based studies show-
ing superiority of second-generation (i.e., stronger) devices to
control craving (45–47). These behavioral outcomes did not easily
translate to changes in exposure. We had expected that CO and
NNAL would roughly correspond to changes in smoking. This was
partially supported in that there was a greater decrease in CO
amongparticipantswho received thenewerproduct.Therewere no
changes in cotinine over time, nor between groups (or their
interaction), consistent with the notion that smokers self-titrate
their nicotine when using ENDS (48).
Our study provided ENDS free of charge, which we recognize is
not truly naturalistic. Our intent was to remove cost and access
barriers which would allow a more direct test of ENDS per se.
Thus, we observed uptake and outcomes under conditions that
were favorable to ENDS, and whether these same results would
transfer to conditions when smokers have to pay for product is
unclear. Forthcoming regulation of ENDS under the FDA will
prohibit product sampling. Although this study does not provide
sufficient data to overturn that ruling, our results are inconsistent
with the interpretation that sampling does harm, at least to
smokers (sampling directed to nonsmokers being a much greater
public health concern).
Among our study limitations, the small sample size stands out
as prominent. This was not a sufficiently powered trial, and most
results were not statistically significant. Our intent was to high-
light descriptive outcomes of uptake and general effect sizes for
between group comparisons, all of which should guide a larger
study. Second, we used a first-generation ciga-like product, which
at the time of study development was the best option available,
presumed to be a "starter" product among new converts. We have
no reason to believe that outcomes would be worse for a second-
or third-generation e-cigarette. In fact, there is reason to suggest
that outcomes would be even stronger (vs. control conditions) for
newer and more powerful ENDS devices, if only because they are
generally more efficient in nicotine delivery, offer improved
battery duration, and wider flavor assortment (45, 47), all of
which presumably increase consumer appeal and eventual
uptake. Third, our comparison group herein was a nonsampling
control, as opposed to a placebo e-cigarette condition, studied
elsewhere (49). We were less interested in the nicotine-specific
effects of e-cigarette uptake and more interested on the aggregate
experience of trying a new product versus not. Other, more active
control groups might also be considered for future research,
including: comparing ENDS sampling to provision of quit
advice/materials, or perhaps samples of NRTs. Finally, EMA
compliance was modest, somewhat dampening our rigor to assess
daily fluctuations in use. Nonetheless, almost 2,500 EMA entries
were recorded, mitigating this concern. The real challenges of EMA
with respect to studies of ENDS pertain to quantification of use
(e.g., operational definitions of puffs vs. puffing episodes),
particularly when these metrics do not easily translate from
conventional smoking (CPD). The current study provides some
guidance worth consideration, as do others (50, 51), and newer
devices with built-in technology to capture these metrics signif-
icantly expand the research potential.
Our study design is worth further comment, particularly given
our prior research using similar methodology to examine sam-
pling of other products. Randomized yet naturalistic designs
allow for causal inferences on downstream behavior as well the
more immediate effects of uptake and patterns of use. Prior trials
have shown modest improvements in cessation-related outcomes
when smokers sample NRT (34, 35, 52) but mixed or somewhat
negative outcomes for snus (33). The relative response to multiple
products can only come from studies that offer each, but these
studies are rare (53, 54) and difficult if focused on long-term
behavioral outcomes.
In sum, the results of this small pilot study suggest strong
interest and uptake of ENDS among smokers, with favorable
perception comparable with that of conventional cigarettes, and
trends toward positive changes in cessation-related behavior.
These findings, in need of replication within a larger trial, are
generally consistent with reviews elsewhere that document pos-
itive effects of ENDS among adult smokers (2, 4, 55). More studies
are needed to rigorously examine the naturalistic impact of ENDS
on smoking behavior (56).
