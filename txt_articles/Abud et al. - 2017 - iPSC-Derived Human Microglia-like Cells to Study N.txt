SUMMARY
Microglia play critical roles in brain development,
homeostasis, and neurological disorders. Here, we
report that human microglial-like cells (iMGLs) can
be differentiated from iPSCs to study their function
in neurological diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). We find that iMGLs develop in vitro similarly to
microglia in vivo, and whole-transcriptome analysis
demonstrates that they are highly similar to cultured
adult and fetal human microglia. Functional assess-
ment of iMGLs reveals that they secrete cytokines in
response to inflammatory stimuli, migrate and un-
dergo calcium transients, and robustly phagocytose
CNS substrates. iMGLs were used to examine the ef-
fects of Ab fibrils and brain-derived tau oligomers on
AD-related gene expression and to interrogate mech-
anisms involved in synaptic pruning. Furthermore,
iMGLs transplanted into transgenic mice and human
brain organoids resemble microglia in vivo. Together,
these findings demonstrate that iMGLs can be used
to study microglial function, providing important
new insight into human neurological disease.
INTRODUCTION
Microglia are the innate immune cells of the CNS and play impor-
tant roles in synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, homeostatic func-
tions, and immune activity. Microglia also play a critical role in
neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), high-
lighting the need to improve our understanding of their function in
both health and disease. Yet, studying human microglia is chal-
lenging because of the rarity and difficulty in acquiring primary
cells from human fetal or adult CNS tissue. Therefore, there is
a pressing need to develop a renewable source of human micro-
glia, such as from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
The challenges of generating microglia from iPSCs are due to
their unique developmental origin. Elegant lineage tracing
studies show that microglia originate from yolk sac erythromye-
loid progenitors (EMP) generated during primitive hematopoiesis
(Ginhoux et al., 2010; Kierdorf et al., 2013; Schulz et al., 2012).
EMPs further develop to early primitive macrophages that
migrate into the developing neural tube and become microglial
progenitors (Kierdorf et al., 2013; Prinz and Priller, 2014). Micro-
glia progenitors then mature and develop ramified processes
used to survey their environment, facilitate CNS development,
modulate synaptic plasticity, and respond to CNS injury and pa-
thology. Recently, murine studies identified key cytokines, cell
receptors, and transcription factors required for microglia devel-
opment and survival in vivo. These factors include IL-34 and
TGFb1 (Butovsky et al., 2014; Greter et al., 2012; Wang et al.,
2012; Yamasaki et al., 2014). We hypothesized that iPSCs could
be differentiated to human microglia in vitro by providing cues
that mimic the environment present in the developing embryo.
The generation of patient-derived iPSCs has facilitated new
opportunities to examine the relationships between genetic
risk factors and disease. Recently, genome-wide association
studies (GWASs) have identified several genes expressed by

 microglia that are associated with the risk of developing late-
onset AD (LOAD), such as TREM2 and CD33. The role of these
genes in microglial function and AD is just beginning to be exam-
ined in mouse models, but the generation of human microglia-
like cells would allow for the interrogation of human-specific
genes that cannot be modeled in mice.
In AD, microglia cluster around b-amyloid plaques highlighting
their inability to clear b-amyloid (Hickman et al., 2008; Liu et al.,
2010). Microglia are also implicated in the neuroinflammatory
component of AD etiology, including cytokine/chemokine secre-
tion, which exacerbates disease pathology (Guillot-Sestier and
Town, 2013). Furthermore, microglia-expressed AD-GWAS
genes, like TREM2 and CD33, likely play a role in AD progres-
sion. Thus, there is a pressing need to further our understanding
of human microglia and the influence of both pathology and dis-
ease-associated genes on microglial function. Addressing this
critical need, we report the effective and robust generation of hu-
man iPSC microglial-like cells (iMGLs) that resemble fetal and
adult microglia and demonstrate their utility in investigating
neurological diseases like AD.
RESULTS
Human Microglia-like Cells Are Generated from iPSCs
A two-step fully defined protocol was developed to efficiently
generate microglia-like cells from iPSCs in just over 5 weeks
(Figure 1A). This approach was used to successfully produce
iMGLs from ten independent iPSC lines (Figures S1A–S1C). A
critical prerequisite is the robust differentiation of iPSCs to he-
matopoietic progenitors (iHPCs). This recapitulates microglia
ontogeny as iHPCs represent early primitive hematopoietic cells
derived from the yolk sac that give rise to microglia during
development (Ginhoux et al., 2010; Kierdorf et al., 2013). Our
protocol (depicted in Figure 1Bi) yields primitive iHPCs that are
CD43+/CD235a+/CD41+ after 10 days (Kennedy et al., 2007;
Sturgeon et al., 2014). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) for CD43+ cells reveal that our approach produces iHPCs
with a >90% purity (Figure 1Bii). The resulting iHPCs resembled a
commercial source (Cellular Dynamics International) and repre-
sent the hematopoietic progenitor used to generate iMGLs.
Next, CD43+ iHPCs were grown in serum-free differentiation
medium (formulated in house) containing CSF-1, IL-34, and
TGFb1. By day 14, cells expressed the myeloid-associated tran-
scription factor PU.1 and the microglia-enriched protein TREM2
(Figure 1Aiii), demonstrating an early commitment toward micro-
glial fate. Because this protocol yields large amounts of iMGLs,
microglia development was studied in vitro as cells could be
characterized every 4 days by flow cytometry. Day 14 early
iMGLs were c-kit�/CD45+ (Figure 1C), suggesting commitment
toward a myeloid lineage. Additionally, cells can be further
subdivided into CD45+/CX3CR1� (A1) and CD45+/CX3CR1+
(A2) populations, similar to developing microglial progenitors
identified in vivo (Kierdorf et al., 2013). CD45 expression was
consistently monitored in developing iMGLs and compared to
monocyte-derived macrophages (MD-M4). While CD45 expres-
sion increased with maturation, levels never reached that of
macrophages (Figure 1D), consistent with murine development
(Kierdorf et al., 2013). A small population of iMGLs (�10%)
also expressed intermediate CD11b levels by day 14 that also
increased as cells matured but again never reached macro-
phage levels (Figures 1E and 1F).
By day 38, iMGLs resemble human microglia, but not mono-
cytes nor macrophages, by cytospin/Giemsa staining (Figure 1G)
and express many other microglial-enriched proteins, including
MERTK, ITGB5, CX3CR1, TGFbR1, and PROS1 (Figures 1H; Fig-
ure S4). Like murine microglia development in vivo, iMGLs devel-
oping in vitro express PU.1, TREM2, and CD11bint/CD45low
(Figures 1Aiii and 1D–1F). As iMGLs mature in vitro, they also
become more ramified, similar to microglia in vivo (Figures 1Aiv
and 1H). Furthermore, purinergic receptor P2RY12 and TREM2
co-expression was enriched in iMGLs when compared to mono-
cytes and quantification reveals that our protocol yielded iMGLs
of high purity (>97.2%, n = 5) (Figure 1I; Figures S2A and S2B).
Genomic integrity was also maintained over the course of dif-
ferentiation. Assessing copy number variants across all chromo-
somes demonstrated that extra chromosomal fragments were
not acquired by iMGLs when compared to their respective iPSCs
(n = 6, Figures S1D and S1E). A comparison of a representative
differentiation across the entire probeset (n = 383, nCounter
Human Karyotype Panel) revealed a high correlation between
the iPSC and iMGL genomes (r2 > 0.92, Figure S1F). Importantly,
this protocol typically yielded 30–40 million iMGLs from one
million iPSCs, suggesting that our approach can be readily
scaled up for high content screening. All iPSC work was per-
formed with approval from the appropriate University of Cali-
fornia, Irvine oversight committee (see STAR Methods).
iMGLs Resemble Human Fetal and Adult Microglia
Next, the iMGL transcriptome was profiled in comparison to hu-
man primary fetal microglia (Fetal MG) and adult microglia (Adult
MG). CD14+/CD16� monocytes (CD14 M), CD14+/CD16+ inflam-
matory monocytes (CD16 M), myeloid dendritic cells (Blood
DCs), iHPCs (Figure S2C–S2E), and iPSCs were also examined
to compare iMGLs to stem cells and other myeloid molecular
signatures. Correlation analysis and principal component anal-
ysis (PCA) revealed striking similarity of iMGLs (blue) to Fetal
MG (orange) and Adult MG (green) (Figure 2A; Figure S3A). We
confirmed that myeloid, hematopoietic, and stem cells used
in correlation and PCA analyses expressed lineage-specific
markers (Figure S3B). Furthermore, the first principal component
PC1 (21.3% variance, Figure 2A, arrows) defines the differen-
tiation time series from iPSC through iHPC to our iMGL cells
while PC2 and PC3 define the dendritic and monocyte trajec-
tories, respectively. Biclustering analysis using 300 microglial,

 macrophage, and other immune-related genes adapted from
previous studies (Butovsky et al., 2014; Hickman et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2014) identified similarities between groups and
highlighted common gene clusters but also uncovered differ-
ences between all groups. Again, this analysis showed that
iMGLs cluster with microglia but are distinct from other myeloid

n = 23,580 genes). PCA analysis reveals that iMGL cluster with Adult and Fetal MG and not with other myeloid cells. PC1 (21.3% var.) reflects the time series of
iPSC differentiation to iHPC (yellow arrow) and then to iMGLs (blue arrow). PC2 (15.4% var.) reflects the trajectory to Blood DCs. PC3 (7.6% var.) reflects the
trajectory to monocytes.

Representative profiles are shown for genes up- and downregulated in both human microglia (fetal/adult) and iMGLs.

 cells, iHPCs, and iPSCs (Figure 2B). All studies using human tis-
sue were approved by the appropriate institutional review board
(see STAR Methods).
Importantly, iMGLs, Fetal MG, and Adult MG express canoni-
cal microglial genes, such as P2RY12, GPR34, C1Q, CABLES1,
BHLHE41, TREM2, ITAM PROS1, APOE, SLCO2B1, SLC7A8,
PPARD, and CRYBB1 (Figure 2C; Table S1). When compared
to monocytes, iMGLs express the myeloid genes RUNX1,
PU.1, and CSF1R are enriched for P2RY12, OLFML3, and
GPR34 yet do not express monocyte-specific transcription fac-
tors IRF1, KLF4, and NR4A1 (Abdollahi et al., 1991; Hanna et al.,
2011; Lavin et al., 2014) (Figures S3C–S3E). Differential analysis
between iMGLs, CD14 M, and CD16 M (Figure S3F) further
emphasized that iMGLs predominantly express microglial genes
(greater than 2-fold change and p < 0.001), including CX3CR1,
TGFbR1, RGS10, and GAS6, but not monocyte and macrophage
genes KLF2, TREM1, MPO, ITGAL, and ADGRE5. At the protein
level, iMGLs, like primary microglia, are CD45lo compared to
CD45hi MD-M4 and express the microglia surface proteins
CX3CR1, TGFbR1, P2RY12, MERTK, PROS1, and ITGB5 (Fig-
ures S2A and S4A–S4C). Collectively, unbiased whole-transcrip-
tome analysis and protein expression of key microglial markers
strongly establishes iMGLs as a cell model that highly resembles
primary human microglia that can be used to study microglia
physiology and function in human health and disease.
Whole-transcriptome differential gene expression analysis
revealed increased expression of 1,957 genes and 1,071 genes
in iMGLs when compared to Fetal MG or Adult MG, respec-
tively. We also observed decreased expression of 1,916 genes
compared to fetal MG and 1,263 genes compared to Adult MG.
Enrichment analysis between iMGLs and primary microglia
show that iMGLs are enriched for pathways involving cell cycle
processes, migration, microtubule cytoskeletal organization,
and inflammatory response but do not differ in core myeloid
gene ontology (GO) terms (Tables S4–S6). These terms reflect
expected processes in which iMGLs are cued to respond to
the environment and possess a capacity for renewal and matu-
ration that have previously been reported in cultured microglia
(Butovsky et al., 2014). Differential gene expression analysis
between Fetal MG and Adult MG identified pathways related
to responses to environment, like migration and phagocytosis
regulation, but not key myeloid genes in Fetal MG. Adult MG
enrichment includes electron cryomicroscopy (ECM) organiza-
tion, nervous system regulation, cell adhesion, and negative
regulation of cell proliferation.
Functional Validation of iMGLs
Next, iMGLs were validated as surrogates of microglia using both
functional and physiological assays. By flow cytometry analysis,
iMGLs were CD11bint/CD45lo-int, similar to Fetal MG (Figures 3A
and 3B). Next, cytokine/chemokine secretion by iMGLs was
measured following stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
IL-1b, or IFNg. IL-1b and IFNg are two cytokines that are elevated
in AD patients and mouse models (Abbas et al., 2002; Blum-De-
gen et al., 1995; Marsh et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2005; Wang et al.,
2015) (Figure 3C). Basally, iMGLs secrete ten of the examined
cytokines at low, but detectable, levels (Table S2). However, in
response to IFNg or IL-1b, iMGLs secrete eight different chemo-
kines, including TNFa, CCL2, CCL4, and CXCL10. As expected,
iMGLs robustly responded to LPS with induction of all measured
cytokines except for CCL3 (Table S2 for values). Collectively,
iMGLs differentially release cytokines/chemokines based on
their cell surface receptor stimuli, a finding that closely aligns
with the responses observed in acutely isolated primary micro-
glia (Rustenhoven et al., 2016).
iMGLs express the microglial-enriched purinergic receptor
P2RY12, which sense extracellular nucleotides from degenerating
neurons, and is critical for microglial homeostatic function (De
Simone et al., 2010; Moore et al., 2015) (Figures S2A and S2B).
In response to ADP, iMGLs chemotax toward ADP and produce
detectable calcium transients (Figures 3D and 3E) that were both
negated by a P2RY12-specific inhibitor, PSB0739. These physio-
logical findings further underscore that iMGLs respond appropri-
ately to stimuli and express functional surface receptors, such as
P2RY12, enabling quantitative analyses of microglial physiology.
Microglia, like astrocytes, play a critical role in synaptic prun-
ing (Aguzzi et al., 2013; Paolicelli et al., 2011; Stephan et al.,
2012). Because in vitro synaptosome phagocytosis assays are
an established surrogate to study pruning, the ability of iMGLs
to phagocytose human synaptosomes (hS) was quantitatively
assessed. In comparison to MD-M4, iMGL phagocytosis of
pHrodo-labeled hS was less robust (Figures 3F and 3G). How-
ever, iMGLs preferentially internalized hS when compared to
E. coli particles and normalized to MD-M4 (Figures S4D and
S4E), supporting the notion that iMGLs and microglia are more
polarized toward homeostatic functions than MD-M4.
As iMGLs and primary microglia express both C1q and CR3
(CD11b/CD18 dimer), iMGLs were used to assess whether syn-
aptic pruning in human microglia primarily involves this pathway
as seen in mice (Hong et al., 2016a, 2016b). Using an additive-
free CD11b antibody, iMGL phagocytosis of hS was significantly

but not in PSB0739-treated group (black trace). Right: representative images of ADP-induced calcium flux at 240 s in vehicle (top) and PSB0739 (bottom).

 reduced (�40.0%, ***p < 0.0001) (Figures 3H and 3I). In contrast,
an inhibitor of MERTK (UNC569), also implicated in synaptic
pruning, only marginally decreased iMGL hS phagocytosis
(�12.6%, *p < 0.05) (Figures 3H and 3I). Similar to studies in mu-
rine knockout (KO) models, our data indicate that MERTK plays a
minor role in human microglia-mediated synaptic pruning
(Chung et al., 2013), whereas C1q/CR3 is integral for micro-
glia-mediated synaptic pruning in humans.

of AD pathology are being actively pur-
sued by biopharma. Therefore, we exam-
ined whether iMGLs can phagocytose
Ab or tau, two hallmark AD pathologies.
Like primary microglia, iMGLs internalize
fluorescently labeled fibrillar Ab (fAb) (Fig-
ure 4B). iMGLs also recognized and inter-
nalized pHrodo-labeled brain-derived tau
oligomers (BDTOs) (Figure 4B). Fluores-
cence emitted indicates trafficking of
pHrodo-conjugated BDTOs to the acidic
lysosomal compartment, showing that
iMGLs can actively ingest extracellular
tau that may be released during neuronal cell death (Villegas-
Llerena et al., 2016) and support recent findings that microglia
may play a role in tau propagation in AD and other tauopathies
(Asai et al., 2015). Together, these findings suggest that iMGLs
could be utilized to identify compounds in high-throughput
drug-screening assays that enhance Ab degradation or block
exosome-mediated tau release.
Microglia genes are implicated in late-onset AD, yet how they
modify disease risk remains largely unknown. Thus, iMGLs were
utilized to begin investigating how these genes might influence
microglia function and AD risk. Hierarchical clustering using
just these 25 AD-GWAS genes also demonstrates that iMGLs
284
Neuron 94, 278–293, April 19, 2017
 resemble microglia and not peripheral myeloid cells (Figure 4A).
In their investigated basal state, iMGLs and microglia express
many AD-GWAS-related genes, including those without murine
orthologs, i.e., CD33, MS4A4A, and CR1. Thus, iMGLs can be
used to study how altered expression of these genes influence
microglia phenotype in a way that cannot be recapitulated in
transgenic mice. Therefore, iMGLs were used to investigate
the influence of fAb or BDTOs on AD-GWAS gene expression
in microglia (Villegas-Llerena et al., 2016) (Figure 4C). Following
fAb exposure, iMGLs increased expression of ten genes (Ta-
ble S3), including ABCA7 (5.79 ± 0.44), CD33 (6.02 ± 0.41),
TREM2 (4.86 ± 0.50), and APOE (2.52 ± 0.19), genes implicated
in Ab clearance/degradation. BDTOs increased expression of
four genes, including CD2AP (4.62 ± 0.45), previously implicated
in tau-mediated toxicity (Shulman et al., 2014). In addition, six
genes were differentially elevated in fAb compared to BDTOs
(Table S3). Interestingly, CD33, TYROBP, and PICALM, genes
more enriched in other myeloid cells at baseline, were upregu-
lated by fAb and BDTOs, suggesting that proteinopathies may
alter microglia phenotype to resemble invading peripheral
myeloid cells (Chan et al., 2007; Prinz et al., 2011; Stalder
et al., 2005). In addition to AD-GWAS genes, iMGLs express
other CNS disease-related genes, including APP, PSEN1/2,
HTT, GRN, TARDBP, LRRK2, C9orf72, SOD1, VCP, and FUS,
and therefore can likely be used to study other neurological dis-
eases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s
disease (HD), frontal temporal dementia (FTD), and dementia
with Lewy bodies (DLB), in which microglia may play a prominent
role (Bachstetter et al., 2015; Crotti et al., 2014; Lui et al., 2016;
O’Rourke et al., 2016) (Figure S6C).
iMGL Maturation and Homeostasis Are Modulated by a
CNS Environment
Neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells in the brain interact
with microglia to influence gene expression and function. Our dif-
ferentiation protocol attempted to recapitulate CNS cues pre-
sent in the brain by including signals derived from these other
cell types, including CX3CL1, CD200, and TGFb. Whole-tran-
scriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis confirmed the
importance of these factors for establishing microglia in vitro
(Figures S5 and S6). TGFb, a glia-derived cytokine, is needed
for murine microglia development in vivo and in maintaining the
microglial-specific transcriptome signature (Abutbul et al.,
2012; Butovsky et al., 2014; Schilling et al., 2001). Differential
gene expression analysis confirmed TGFb’s role in maintaining
the human microglia transcriptome signature; 1,262 genes
were differentially expressed in iMGLs with TGFb, whereas
1,517 genes were differentially expressed in iMGLs after TGFb
removal (24 hr). Many of the differentially expressed genes are
identified
as
core
microglial
signature
targets,
including
P2RY12, TGFbR1, and CD33, and transcription factors EGR1,
ETV5, and APOE (Figures S5A–S5C). Examination of gene
ontology
highlight
neurodegenerative
disease
pathways,
including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases,
that are TGFb dependent (Figure S5D). Furthermore, removal
of TGFb led to significant changes in many of the human micro-
glia homeostatic targets also identified as AD-GWAS loci genes,
including TREM2, APOE, ABCA7, SPI1 (CELF1 locus), PILRA
(ZCWPW1 locus), and the HLA-DR and MS4A gene clusters
(Karch et al., 2016), suggesting many identified AD-GWAS genes
function in the maintenance of microglia homeostasis (Fig-
ure S5E) and underscoring the utility of iMGLs to interrogate
AD-GWAS gene function.
CX3CL1 and CD200 are both neuronal- and endothelial-
derived cues that can further educate iMGLs toward an endog-
enous microglia phenotype (reviewed in Kierdorf and Prinz,
2013). To test this hypothesis, we examined how inclusion or
exclusion of these factors modulates iMGL phenotype. The addi-
tion of CD200 and CX3CL1 to iMGLs increased the expression of
select genes like COMT (Bennett et al., 2016) (Figure S5B),
CD52, a cell surface receptor that binds Siglec10 and interacts
with DAP12 as part of the microglia sensome (Hickman et al.,
2013), and HLA-DRB5, a member of the MHC II complex impli-
cated in AD, while maintaining similar expression levels of
core-microglial genes (e.g., P2RY12, TYROBP, and OLFML3)
and AD risk genes (Figure S6A). Importantly, we found that
CD200 and CX3CL1 modulated iMGL response to CNS stimuli,
such as fAb. In the absence of CD200 and CX3CL1, fAb stimu-
lated the expression of AD-GWAS genes implicated in inter-
acting with misfolded folded protein, surface receptors, or
anti-apoptotic events, such as CLU (APOJ) (Yeh et al., 2016).
Whereas cells exposed to these two factors responded differen-
tially to fAb, increasing expression of genes involved in neuronal
cell surface motif recognition, or phagocytosis of CNS sub-
strates, including MS4A genes, TREM2, TYROBP, CD33, and
ABCA7 (Bradshaw et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2016; Greer et al.,
2016) (Figure S6B). These studies further support the notion
that CD200-CD200R1 and/or CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis can prime
microglia to respond to neurodegenerative conditions (Prinz
and Priller, 2014). Thus, exposure to soluble CNS factors, like
CD200 and CX3CL1, may allow for access to microglial-specific
transcriptional regulator elements (enhancers and promoters)
(Gosselin et al., 2014; Lavin et al., 2014), although future studies
are required to fully translate these observations.
Next, we examined whether iMGL maturation can be achieved
with direct contact with the CNS environment. Therefore, iMGLs
were cultured with rat hippocampal neurons (21 days in vitro
[DIV]) to assess how iMGLs respond to neuronal surface cues
(Figure 5A). Rat hippocampal neurons were used because they
readily form synapses in culture and can be generated with
limited variability. iMGLs were subsequently separated from
neurons by FACS with human-specific CD45 and CD11b
antibodies and profiled at the transcriptome level (Figure 5B).
Differential gene expression analysis revealed that neuronal
co-culturing upregulated 156 and downregulated 244 iMGL
genes (Figures 5C and 5D). FFAR2 and COL26A1 are two genes
differentially expressed in iMGLs cultured with only defined
factors and indicate a developmentally primed microglia profile.
In contrast, co-culturing microglia with neurons increased
expression of SIGLEC11 and SIGLEC12, human-specific sialic-
acid binding proteins that interact with the neuronal glycocalyx,
function in neuroprotection, and suppress pro-inflammatory
signaling, and thus maintain a microglia homeostatic state
(Linnartz-Gerlach et al., 2014; Wang and Neumann, 2010).
Additionally, we saw increased expression of microglial genes
CABLES1, TRIM14, MITF, MMP2, and SLC2A5. Overall, these
Neuron 94, 278–293, April 19, 2017
285
 results implicate both soluble and surface CNS cues as factors in
microglia maturation (Biber et al., 2007) (Figures 5E and 5F).
A fundamental characteristic of microglia is the surveillance
of the CNS environment with their highly ramified processes.
To investigate how iMGLs might interact within a human brain
environment and to test whether iMGLs invade BORGs similarly
to how microglia enter the developing neural tube (Chan et al.,
2007; Rezaie and Male, 1999), we cultured iMGLs with hiPSC
3D brain organoids (BORGs). BORGs include neurons, astro-
cytes, and oligodendrocytes that self-organize into a cortical-
like network but lack microglia (Figure 6). By day 3, iMGLs
had embedded into the BORGS and were not detected in the
media, suggesting rapid iMGL chemotaxis toward CNS cues
(Figures 6A–6C). By day 7, iMGLs (green) also tiled and
extended varying degrees of ramified processes within the 3D
organoid environment (Figures 6D–6F). To determine whether
iMGLs respond to neuronal injury, we pierced BORGS with a
25G needle. After injury, iMGLs clustered near the injury site

response, negative regulation of leukocyte differentiation, and cell adhesion molecules. Cells cultured in absence of neurons had a complimentary gene profile
with 20 statistically significant biological modules (blue histogram), including hallmark cholesterol homeostasis, hallmark TNFa signaling via NF-kB, leukocyte
differentiation, and regulation of IL-1b secretion.

 and adopted a more amoeboid morphology, resembling ‘‘acti-
vated’’ microglia found in injured or diseased brains (Ketten-
mann et al., 2011) (Figures 6G–6I). Collectively, these data
demonstrate that iMGLs can integrate within an in vitro 3D
CNS environment, mature, ramify, and respond to injury similar
to brain microglia.
Next, we sought to examine iMGLs within the context of a CNS
environment in vivo. To this end, we transplanted iMGLs (day 38)
into the cortex of MITRG mice that are Rag2-deficient and IL2rg-
deficient mice and also express the human forms of four cyto-
kines knocked in (M-CSFh;IL-3/GM-CSFh;TPOh), allowing for
xenotransplantation and survival of myeloid and other leuko-
cytes (Rongvaux et al., 2014). 2 months after transplantation,
the homeostatic state and identity of transplanted microglia
were
assessed
with
P2RY12
and
the
human-specific
TMEM119 antibodies, respectively (Bennett et al., 2016; Butov-
sky et al., 2014; Haynes et al., 2006) (Figure 7). Human-specific
markers, Ku80 (hNuclei) and cytoplasmic SC121 (hCyto), distin-
guished iMGLs from
endogenous microglia.
Transplanted
human iMGLs co-expressing both Ku80 and P2RY12 were
abundant within MITRG brains, suggesting long-term engraft-
ment
potential
(Figures
7A–7D).
At
higher
magnification,
P2RY12 is expressed in highly ramified iMGLs resembling quies-
cent cortical microglia; the membrane distribution accentuates
the finer extended processes (Figures 7B–7D) (Baron et al.,
2014). TMEM119 and IBA1 were also expressed in both hCyto+
soma and in highly arborized iMGL processes (Figures 7E–7L). At
higher magnification, TMEM119 is predominately membrane
bound, in agreement with previous studies (Bennett et al.,
2016). Together, these findings demonstrate engraftment and
long-term survival of iMGLs that result in highly branched, micro-
glia-like cells expressing IBA1, P2RY12, and TMEM119 (Figures
7I–7L), in which iMGLs resemble endogenous quiescent micro-
glia. Finally, the morphology and high P2RY12 expression sug-
gest that transplanted iMGLs are actively surveying their
neuronal environment that translates to their potential use in
studying human microglia function in mouse CNS disease
models.
To test this hypothesis, we transplanted iMGLs into the
hippocampi of xenotransplantation-compatible AD mice, previ-
ously generated and characterized in our lab (Marsh et al.,
2016), to examine how iMGLs interact with AD neuropa-
thology in vivo (Figures 7M–7P; Figure S7). Transplanted iMGLs
engraft and migrate along white matter tracts, similar to
microglia in development (Figure 7M). In many instances,
iMGLs migrated and extended processes toward Ab plaques

 to begin walling them off (Figures 7N–7P; Movie S1). A number
of iMGLs also began to phagocytose fibrillar Ab (Figures
7N–7P; Figures S7E–S7H). Similarly, human fetal microglia
migrated toward Ab, extended processes, and phagocytosed
Ab when transplanted in the same AD transgenic model
(Figures S7A–S7D).

Within the brains of xenotransplantation compatible mice, transplanted iMGLs are ramified and interact with the neuronal environment.

 DISCUSSION
Here, we show that human microglia-like cells can be generated
from iPSCs following a fully defined and highly efficient protocol,
which enables high purity (>97%) and robust scalability. Impor-
tantly, iMGLs are highly similar to cultured human adult and fetal
microglia by both transcriptomic and functional analyses. Our
whole-transcriptome PCA also highlights the differentiation tra-
jectory of iPSCs toward iHPCs and then iMGLs. Moreover, our
series of microglial functional assays, only possible with a high
yield and pure protocol, further strengthens how iMGLs can be
used to investigate microglia genes implicated in disease and
understand physiological function both in vitro and in vivo.
We also demonstrate the use of iMGLs to investigate human
microglial function as a therapeutic target in human disease. A
recent study implicated complement and increased microglia-
mediated pruning of synapses early in AD (Hong et al., 2016a,
2016b). Here, we found that blocking CR3, via anti-CD11b, in
iMGLs reduced phagocytosis of human synaptosomes. Our
findings provide one of the first examples, to our knowledge, of
quantitative
evidence
showing
human
microglia
engulfing
human synaptosomes predominately via the CR3 axis, as
implicated by transgenic mouse studies (Hong et al., 2016a).
Moreover, we highlight the utility of iMGLs to examine micro-
glia-targeted AD therapies, such as anti-CD11b, in phagocytic
assays and to potentially examine or validate other comple-
ment-targeted therapies in development.
Microglia mediate neuroinflammation through surveillance of
their environment and by cell surface receptor activation. There-
fore, we tested iMGL response to extracellular stimuli observed in
AD, such as nucleotides leaked from degenerating neurons. Mi-
croglia sense ADP release via purinergic receptors, and we like-
wise find that iMGLs robustly express functional P2RY12 and
migrate and exhibit calcium influx via an ADP-P2RY12 receptor
mechanism. Also, iMGLs secrete a variety of cytokines in
response to IFNg, IL-1b, and LPS stimulation. Many of these cy-
tokines are known to be highly elevated in neurological diseases
and/or involved in the recruitment of peripheral immune cells into
the CNS under pathological conditions (Chan et al., 2007; Prinz
et al., 2011; Rezaie and Male, 1999; Stalder et al., 2005). Micro-
glial-mediated cytokine secretion can further influence the in-
flammatory milieu in the CNS and thus represents an excellent
therapeutic target for restoring CNS homeostatic balance.
Together, migration, calcium imaging, and cytokine secretion as-
says not only validate iMGLs to be highly similar to brain-derived
microglia, but provide important functional assays to assess the
role of microglia in neuroinflammation. Furthermore, our data
highlight the potential utility of iMGLs to identify therapeutic com-
pounds via high-throughput assessment of microglia physiology.
Since the discovery of SNPs in immune genes as AD risk fac-
tors, microglia have been further highlighted in human neurolog-
ical health and disease. Several of these AD-GWAS genes,
including CD33 and CR1, lack functionally similar murine ortho-
logs. Thus, iMGLs can be utilized to investigate AD-GWAS genes
and elucidate their roles in human microglia biology. Ab fibrils up-
regulated APOE, TREM2, CD33, and APOJ, genes previously
implicated in modulating Ab phagocytosis and clearance
(Bradshaw et al., 2013; Yeh et al., 2016). We also found that
MS4A6A gene expression was increased. While the role of the
MS4A gene cluster in microglia function and AD risk is still un-
known, our data suggest a potential role in modulating Ab inter-
actions. Furthermore, CD200 and CX3CL1 were important
developmental CNS cues for generating iMGLs that can respond
appropriately to Ab. These data implicate these factors in modu-
lating promoter/enhancer regions that enables appropriate re-
sponses to stimuli previously shown for macrophages (Gosselin
et al., 2014; Lavin et al., 2014) (further reviewed in Glass and Na-
toli, 2016). Lastly, a TGFb-dependent homeostatic microglia
signature was identified that paralleled murine studies and high-
light that AD-GWAS genes function in microglia homeostasis.
Taken together, our studies emphasize the importance of micro-
glia in AD risk and the utility of iMGLs to interrogate genotype-
phenotype relationships of recent AD-GWAS single nucleotide
polymorphisms.
We also highlight how neuronal co-culture can further modu-
late microglial gene expression and how interactions with the
neuronal glycocalyx increase Siglec expression. Interestingly,
iMGLs not cultured with neurons differentially expressed early
microglia genes, including FFAR2 (Erny et al., 2015; Matco-
vitch-Natan et al., 2016), suggesting that other factors are
needed to further educate microglia as tissue-resident macro-
phages of the brain. In accordance with this notion, iMGLs
cultured in 3D brain cultures actively migrate, tile, and encom-
pass the volume of the BORGs, extending processes reminis-
cent of early microglia development. We also show that iMGLs
transplanted in mice, engraft, survive, and display characteristic
ramified
processes
that
have
increased
branch
order
complexity, closely resembling quiescent microglia (Andreasson
et al., 2016). We also note that transplanted, highly ramified
iMGLs were morphological heterogeneous within the brain (Fig-
ures 7I–7L). This morphological diversity is indicative of microglia
responding to distinct cortical layers/brain regions and poten-
tially reflect microglia subtypes found within the brain (Grabert
et al., 2016). Our results also demonstrate that iMGLs can
respond appropriately to the neurotoxic buildup of Ab, thus
providing a model system to investigate the role of microglia in
various proteinopathies.
Overall, these results underscore the potential of iMGLs as a
renewable source of patient-derived, microglial-like cells for
studying the role of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases.
While our comparisons were limited to cultured microglia, we
showed that our cells were highly similar to primary cells, and
our studies have highlighted potential new ways to culture micro-
glia within BORGs or mouse brains. For example, transplantation
of iMGLs into various CNS disease mouse models will allow for
the study of human microglial function in neurodegenerative dis-
ease in vivo that may be influenced by genetics and the inheri-
tance of specific mutations. This platform will allow for the
identification of potential novel, microglial-based translational
therapies, as recently discussed (Biber et al., 2016). Finally, while
technical challenges exist for isolating microglia from both human
brain and BORGS for study, the development of future tools will
likely make it feasible to compare microglia isolated from BORGs
with freshly isolated microglia to determine whether 3D organoid
systems fully recapitulate the in vivo microglia signature. In
summary, we demonstrate a methodology to generate human
Neuron 94, 278–293, April 19, 2017
289
 microglial-like cells in large quantities from renewable iPSCs that
can be used as primary microglia surrogates.
Our study is one of the first to describe a fully defined, serum-
free protocol for generating microglial cells from induced plurip-
otent stem cells with the exception of a recently published
resource from Muffat and colleagues (Muffat et al., 2016). How-
ever, their approach uses hematopoietic cells derived from
embryoid bodies (EBs) as microglia precursors. One challenge
with the use of an EB-based method and selection by cell adhe-
sion (Muffat et al. 2016 protocol) is the potential contamination
by other cell types that spontaneously arise from EBs, i.e., neuro-
ectoderm including astrocytes. More recently, a protocol
described the production of microglia-like cells reliant on astro-
cyte co-cultures and a serum-based media formulation. This
protocol produces cell quantities comparable to Muffat et al.
(2016) that exhibit amoeboid-like morphology in vitro and in vivo
(Pandya et al., 2017). Thus, some questions remain in terms of
yield, scalability, and purity of homeostatic microglia using these
other methods and whether the resulting cells can be used to
interrogate microglial function in quantitative assays that require
large numbers of pure microglia-like cells.
In summary, we have developed a highly reproducible pro-
tocol to generate iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells
and microglia-like cells in high yield that can be used in functional
assays to interrogate microglia function. We have also identified
a commercial HPC source that can be readily differentiated to
iMGLs with our protocol to study microglia biology. We demon-
strate that iMGLs phagocytose a variety of neuronal substrates,
including b-amyloid, brain-derived tau oligomers, and human
synaptosomes, that can be used to study the influence of AD ge-
netic risk factors, including recently identified novel TREM2 var-
iants (Sirkis et al., 2016) on microglia function, with the potential
to uncover altered microglia pathways that can guide future ther-
apeutic targets. Because many AD-GWAS genes also suggest
microglia-neuronal
crosstalk
(e.g.,
TREM2-lipids,
APOE/J,
CD33-sialic acid, MS4A cluster/lipids), we demonstrated that
iMGLs can be studied in context with neurons and glia by exam-
ining how both rodent and human neuronal cells influence
microglia phenotype and function both in vitro and in vivo. As ex-
pected, iMGLs gene profiles shift toward a neuronal-centric
phenotype and respond appropriately to injury in 3D cell culture
and b-amyloid plaques in AD transgenic mice brains. Together,
our fully defined protocol yields highly pure microglia-like cells
that provide a platform to investigate human microglia function
for a broad range of CNS development, homeostatic function,
and neurological disease applications. While the validation of
iMGLs as microglia surrogates raised several new and exciting
questions related to microglia biology in development, health,
and disease, this new renewable resource will allow for those
questions to be further addressed by the field.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Chemical Reagents
All cell culture flasks, reagents, supplements, cytokines, and general reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, unless
otherwise noted.
Cell Culture
Maintenance and Culture of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells (hPSCs)
All stem cell work was performed with approval from UC Irvine Human Stem Cell Research Oversight (hSCRO) and IBC committees.
The use of human fibroblast and PBMC samples for iPSC reprogramming and differentiation was approved by the University of Cal-
ifornia, Irvine Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol #2013-9561) and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Human
iPSC cell lines ADRC 2 (Male), 4 (Male), 5 (Female), 12 (Male), 14 (Male), 20 (Female), 22 (Female), 76 (Male), 85 (Female), and 86 (Fe-
male) were generated by the UCI Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Core using non-inte-
grating Sendai virus (Cytotune) and are available to other researchers via http://stemcells.mind.uci.edu/. iPSCs were confirmed to be
sterile and karyotypically normal via G-banding (http://www.WiCell.org). Pluripotency of all lines was confirmed via (http://pluritest.
org) and further confirmed using the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Functional Identification Kit (R&D Systems), per manufacturer’s
instructions.
iPSCs were maintained in 6-well plates (Corning) in feeder-free conditions using growth factor-reduced Matrigel (MTG, BD Biosci-
ence) in complete TeSR-E8 medium (STEMCELL Technologies) in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37�C). iPSCs were fed fresh
media daily and passaged every 7-8 days.
Differentiation of iPSCs to Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells
Human iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors were generated using defined conditions with several modifications to previously
published protocols (Kennedy et al., 2007; Sturgeon et al., 2014).
iHPC Differentiation Base Medium Formulation: IMDM (50%), F12 (50%), insulin (0.02 mg/ml), holo-transferrin (0.011 mg/ml), so-
dium selenite (13.4 mg/ml), ethanolamine (4 mg/ml) (can use ITSG-X, 2% v/v, Thermo Fisher Scientific), L-ascorbic acid 2-Phosphate
magnesium (64 mg/ml; Sigma), monothioglycerol (400 mM), PVA (10 mg/ml; Sigma), Glutamax (1X), chemically-defined lipid concen-
trate (1X), non-essential amino acids (NEAA; 1X), Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S; 1% V/V). Use 0.22 mm filter.
Day (�1): iPSCs were washed with room temperature 1X DPBS (minus Ca2+ and Mg2+) once. Wash was aspirated to waste and
TrypLE Select (1X; 37�C; 1 mL per 6-well) and placed in incubator (5% CO2, 37�C). After 3-5 min, cells were placed in cell culture
hood and the side of the plate was lightly tapped for 30 s to dislodge iPSCs. After lightly tapping the plate, 1 mL of room temperature
1X DPBS (minus Ca2+ and Mg2+) was added to each well. Then cells were collected into a 15 mL conical tube (Corning) using a 10 mL
Stripette (Corning). Cells were centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, supernatant was aspirated to
waste and cells were suspended in E8 medium + Y-27632 ROCK Inhibitor (RI,10 mM; R&D Systems), and gently triturated to generate a
single-cell suspension, counted, and cell density adjusted to seed at 5 3 105 cells/cm2 in tissue-culture treated 6-well plates. The final
volume was adjusted to 1.5 mL of E8+ RI per well. Cells were cultured for 24 hr under normoxic conditions (20% O2, 5% CO2, 37�C).
Day (0): Cells were gently collected into a 50 mL conical tube (Corning) using 10 mL Stripette and centrifuged at 300 x g for 6 min at
room temperature (all media changes will require this step using these parameters.). Media was aspirated to waste, and media was

 changed to basal medium complete with FGF2 (50 ng/ml), BMP4 (50 ng/ml), Activin-A (12.5 ng/ml), RI (1 mm) and LiCl (2mM) at 2 mL
per well. Cells were then placed in humidified tri-gas incubator under hypoxic cell culture conditions (5%O2, 5%CO2, 37�C).
Day (2): Cells were quickly and gently collected into a 50 mL conical using 10 mL Stripette and centrifuged. Supernatant was aspi-
rated to waste and media was changed to pre-equilibrated (at 5%O2, 5%CO2, 37�C for 1 hr) base media supplemented with FGF2
(50 ng/ml) and VEGF (50 ng/ml) and returned to the hypoxia incubator.
Day (4): Media was changed to 2 mL per well with basal media containing FGF2 (50 ng/ml), VEGF (50 ng/ml), TPO (50 ng/ml), SCF
(10 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), and IL-3 (10 ng/ml) and placed into a normoxia incubator.
Days (6 and 8): Cells were supplemented with 1ml per well of Day 4 medium.
Day (10): Cells were collected and prepped for FACS (see Method Details) and CD43+ cells were isolated by FACS for iMGL
differentiation. Additionally, iPSC-derived HPCs (Cellular Dynamics International) were identified as a commercial source of
CD43+ progenitors.
Differentiation of iHPCs to iMGLs
iMGL Differentiation Base Medium: Differentiation media consists a base media: phenol-free DMEM/F12 (1:1), insulin (0.02 mg/ml),
holo-transferrin (0.011 mg/ml), sodium selenite (13.4 mg/ml) (can use ITS-G, 2%v/v, Thermo Fisher Scientific), B27 (2% v/v),
N2 (0.5%, v/v), monothioglycerol (200 mM), Glutamax (1X), NEAA (1X), and additional insulin (5 mg/ml; Sigma) and filtered through
a 0.22 mm filter.
Day (0; or day 10 from iPSC): Isolated CD43+ iHPCs were washed using iMGL base differentiation medium and centrifuged at
300 x g for 6 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, supernatant was aspirated to waste and iHPCs were gently suspended
in complete differentiation medium: M-CSF (25 ng/ml), IL-34 (100 ng/ml; PeproTech), and TGFb-1 (50 ng/ml; Militenyi) added fresh
each time. Cell density was adjusted to seed at 1-2 x105 cells in 2 mL of complete medium per well in growth factor-reduced Matrigel-
coated 6-well plates.
Every two days: Each well was supplemented with 1 mL per well of complete differentiation medium.
Day (12; or day 22 from iPSC): Early iMGLs were collected (300x g for 6 min at room temperature) and a 50% media change was
performed.
After 25 days of microglial differentiation (35 days from iPSC), iMGLs were cultured in complete differentiation media supple-
mented with CD200 (100 ng/ml, Novoprotein) and CX3CL1 (100 ng/ml; PeproTech) for an additional three days.
Human Adult and Fetal Microglia Isolation
All studies using human tissue were approved by the McGill University institutional review board (McGill University Health Centre
Ethics Board; #ANTJ2001/1). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Sex of donor was either
not provided or collected. Human microglia were isolated from adult brain tissue using previously described protocols (Durafourt
et al., 2013). Briefly, normal appearing cortical tissue was resected from pharmacologically intractable non-malignant cases of tem-
poral lobe epilepsy. Tissue was cleaned extensively and mechanically dissociated. A single cell suspension was generated following
gentle enzymatic digestion using trypsin and DNase prior to passing through a nylon mesh filter. Single cell suspension underwent a
fickle ultracentrifugation step to remove myelin. Dissociated cells were centrifuged, counted, and plated at 2x106 cells/mL in MEM
supplemented with heat-inactivated FBS (5%), P/S (0.1% v/v) and glutamine (0.1% v/v.). Microglia were grown for 3 days, collected
and plated at 1x105 cells/mL and maintained in culture for 6 days during which time cells received two treatments of TGFb (20 ng/mL)
on days 3 and 5. Human fetal brain tissue was obtained from the Fetal Tissue Repository (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx,
NY). Total RNA was isolated using standard Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) protocols and stored at �80�C.
3D Brain-Organoid Generation
Human 3D brain organoids were generated as previously described, with some modifications (Lancaster et al., 2013). iPSCs were
cultured and maintained on Vitronectin XF (STEMCELL Technologies) in 6-well tissue culture treated plates (BD Falcon) and main-
tained with TeSR-E8 media (STEMCELL Technologies) daily, at 37�C with 5% CO2. At approximately 80% confluency, iPSCs were
detached from the Vitronectin XF substrate using the standard ReLeSR protocol (STEMCELL Technologies) and centrifuged, pel-
leted, and suspended in embryoid body (EB) media, which consists of KO DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), KOSR (20% v/v), Glutamax
(1X), NEAA (1X), 2-Mercaptoethanol (0.1mM), bFGF (4 mg/ml), and HSA (0.1% v/v) and ROCK inhibitor (50 mM), to form EBs. Approx-
imately 1x104 cells were plated per well of a standard V-bottom 96-well plate coated with Lipidure (1% v/v; AMSBio) to avoid having
the EBs attach to the 96-well plate. After 4 days in EB media with bFGF (4 ng/ml) and ROCK inhibitor (50 mM), both the bFGF and
ROCK inhibitor were discontinued leaving the brain organoids in basic EB media for an additional 3 days (7 days total). After the
EB media phase, the EB media is replaced with neural epithelium (NE) media which consists of DMEM/F12, N2 supplement
(0.1% v/v), Glutamax (1X), MEM-NEAA (0.1X), Heparin solution (0.2mg/ml; Sigma), and filtered using 0.22 mm PES filter (EMD Milli-
pore). The brain organoids were transferred to an ultra-low attachment 24-well plate (Corning) using cut P200 pipette tips, with 1-2
EBs per well in 1 mL NE media. The EBs were neuralized in the NE media for five days, after which they were transferred into Matrigel
(Corning) using a mold created from siliconized parafilm and a sterile empty P200 box. The brain organoids were kept in a 6-cm
suspension petri dish with differentiation media consisting of KO DMEM/F12 (50%), Neurobasal medium (50%), N2 supplement
(0.1% v/v), B27 without vitamin A supplement (0.1% v/v), Insulin solution (0.1% v/v; Sigma), 2-Mercaptoethanol (0.1mM), Glutamax
(1X v/v), MEM-NEAA (1X), and Penicillin/Streptomycin (0.1% v/v). After five days of being exposed to differentiation media containing
B27 without vitamin A, the differentiation media was replaced by a formulation that is identical except for the replacement of
B27 without vitamin A to B27 with vitamin A; at this time point, the brain organoids are also transferred to a 125 mL spinning flask

 bioreactor (Corning) siliconized with Sigmacote (Sigma), where they were fed differentiation media with vitamin A weekly for 8 weeks.
After 12 weeks, Borgs were utilized for iMGL co-culture studies.
Rat Cortical and Hippocampal Neuron Isolation
All procedures were performed under an IUCAC approved protocol. Primary cortical and hippocampal neuron cultures were derived
from embryonic rat (E18) as previously described (Loo et al., 1993). Briefly, dissected tissue was dissociated with trypsin, triturated,
and plated on 6-well plates coated with poly-L-lysine coated in NB medium (serum-free Neurobasal supplemented with 1% B27).
Cells were plated at a density of 5 3 106 cells/ml and cells were fed once a week with 50% media change until used for assays.
PBMCs and Monocytes Isolation from Human Blood
The isolation of human monocytes and dendritic cells from de-identified human subjects was performed under IRB Protocol
#2015-2437 and through the UC Irvine ICTS Blood Donor Program. Donor sex: CD14 M = 2 males, 3 females. CD16 M = 2 males,
2 females. Blood DCs were all from female donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors
using Ficoll-paque (GE Healthcare) gradient separation. In brief, blood was layered on top of Ficoll-Paque and centrifuged in swinging
bucket rotator without brake (400x g, 40 min, 18�C). After centrifugation, plasma and upper layers were removed and PBMCs isolated
from the interphase. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS and used immediately. CD14 and CD16 monocytes were
isolated via negative selection from PBMCs using the EasySep Monocyte Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) per manu-
facturer’s instructions. Blood dendritic cells were isolated via negative selection from PBMCs using the EasySep Human Pan-DC
Pre-Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) per manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated cells were washed three times with PBS
and sorted by FACS for either RNA-sequence analysis or used for further macrophage differentiation.
Monocyte-Derived Macrophages
Isolated monocytes (from males) were plated onto tissue culture treated 6-wells at 2 x106 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 media at 37�C 5%
CO2 incubator. After two hours, media was aspirated to waste and adherent monocytes washed three times with DPBS and replaced
with complete media composed of RPMI-1640, FBS (10% v/v), Penicillin/streptomycin (1% v/v), Glutamax (1X). To generate MD-Mf,
M-CSF (25 ng/ml) was added to wells and cells differentiated for 5 days.

Cells were harvested and washed three times with DPBS and stored in RNAlater, RNA preservation solution. RNA was extracted from
all cell types using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA integrity (RIN) was measured for all samples
using the Bioanalzyer Agilent 2100 series. All sequencing libraries analyzed were generated from RNA samples measuring a RIN
score R 9. The Illumina TruSeq mRNA stranded protocol was used to obtain poly-A mRNA from all samples. 200 ng of isolated
mRNA was used to construct RNA-seq libraries. Libraries were quantified and normalized using the Library Quantification Kit
from Kapa Biosystems and sequenced as paired-end 100 bp reads on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.
Confocal Microscopy and Bright-Field Imaging
Immunofluorescent sections were visualized and images captured using an Olympus FX1200 confocal microscope. To avoid non-
specific bleed-through, each laser line was excited and detected independently. All images shown represent either a single confocal
z-slice or z-stack. Bright-field images of cell cultures were captured on an Evos XL Cell Imaging microscope. Image analysis was
performed using Olympus.
FACS and Flow Cytometer Analysis
iHPCs were collected using cold (4�C) sterile filtered and degassed FACS buffer (1X DPBS, 2% BSA, and 0.05mM EDTA) spiked
with human SCF (5 ng/ml). Cells were then filtered through 70 mm mesh to remove large clumps, washed with spiked FACS buffer
(300 x g for 5 min 18�C), then stained (1:200) using spiked FACS buffer on ice for 1 hr in the dark using the following antibodies: anti
CD34-FITC clone 561, anti CD41-PE clone HiP8, anti CD43-APC clone CD43-10G7, anti CD45-APC/Cy7 clone HI30 (Tonbo Biosci-
ences), anti CD235a-PE/Cy7 clone HI264, and ZombieViolet live/dead stain, all from BioLegend unless noted. After staining, iHPCs
were washed once with spiked FACS buffer and suspended using spiked FACS buffer (500-700 ml) and sorted utilizing the BD
FACSARIA Fusion (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were collected in cold basal iHPC differentiation medium spiked with SCF
(10 ng/ml). Collected CD43+ iHPCs were then plated for iMGL differentiation as mentioned above. iMGLs were suspended in
FACS buffer and incubated with human Fc block (BD Bioscience) for 15 min at 4�C. For detection of microglial surface markers, cells
were stained with anti CD11b-FITC clone ICRF44, anti CD45-APC/Cy7 clone HI30 (Tonbo Biosciences), anti CX3CR1-APC clone
2A9-1, anti CD115-PE clone 9-4D, and anti CD117-PerCP-Cy5.5 clone 104D2, ZombieViolet live/dead stain, all from BioLegend.
Cells were sorted on a FACS Aria II, FACS Aria Fusion (BD Biosciences) and data analyzed with FlowJo software (FlowJo).
Cytospin and May-Grunwald Giemsa Stain
1x105 cells were suspended in FACS buffer (100 ml) and added to Shandon glass slides (Biomedical Polymers) and assembled in a
cytology funnel apparatus. Assembled slides containing cells were loaded in a cytospin instrument and centrifuged (500 rpm, 5 min).
Slides were allowed to air-dry for two minutes and immediately stained in May-Grunwald stain (100%; Sigma) for 5 min. Next, slides

 were washed in PBS for 1.5 min and immediately placed in Giemsa stain (4%; Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. Slides were
washed in double-distilled water 6 times and allowed to air-dry for 10 min. Slides were preserved using glass coverslips and
permount (Sigma).
RNA Isolation and qPCR Analysis
Cells were stored in RNAlater stabilizing reagent and RNA was isolated using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (Valencia, CA) following
manufacturer’s guidelines. qPCR analysis was performed using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System and using Taqman qPCR primers.
Analysis of AD-GWAS genes utilized a custom Taqman Low Density Array card using the primers described below.
iMGL Co-culture with Rat Neurons
Rat hippocampal or cortical neurons were cultured for 21 days with 50% media change every 3-4 days. iMGLs were cultured with
neurons at a 1:5 ratio (1 x106 iMGL to 5 3 106 neurons) in 50% iMGL and 50% NB medium. After 3 days, iMGLs were collected for
RNA isolation.
iMGL Transplantation in MITRG and Rag-5xfAD Brains
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with NIH and University of California guidelines approved IAUC protocols (IAUC
#2011-3004). MITRG mice were purchased from Jax (The Jackson Laboratory, #017711) and have been previously characterized
(Rongvaux et al., 2014). MITRG mice allow for xenotransplantation and is designed to support human myeloid engraftment. iMGLs
were harvested at day 38 and suspended in injection buffer: 1X HBSS with M-CSF (10 ng/ml), IL-34 (50 ng/ml), and TGFb-1 (25 ng/ml).
iMGLs were delivered using stereotactic surgery as previously described (Blurton-Jones et al., 2009) using the following coordinates;
AP: �0.6, ML: ± 2.0, DV: �1.65. Brains were collected from mice at day 60 post-transplantation per established protocols (Blurton-
Jones et al., 2009). Rag-5xfAD mice were generated in this lab and previously characterized (Marsh et al., 2016). Rag-5xfAD mice
display robust beta-amyloid pathology and allow for xenotransplantation of human cells. iMGLs were transplanted into the hippo-
campi using the following coordinates; AP: �2.06, ML: ± 1.75, DV: �1.95. After transplantation mice were killed and brains collected
using previously established protocol. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using sodium-barbiturate and perfused through the left-
ventricle with cold 1X HBSS for 4 min. Perfused mice were decapitated and brain extracted and dropped-fixed in PFA (4% w/v)
for 48 hr at 4�C. Brains were then washed 3 times with PBS and sunk in sucrose (30% w/v) solution for 48 hr before coronal sectioning
(40 mm) using a microtome (Leica). Free-floating sections were stored in PBS sodium azide (0.05%) solution at 4�C until IHC was
performed.
Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry
For ICC, cells were washed three times with DPBS (1X) and fixed with cold PFA (4% w/v) for 20 min at room temperature followed by
three washes with PBS (1X). Cells were blocked with blocking solution (1X PBS, 5% goat or donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 hr
at room temperature. ICC primary antibodies were added at respective dilutions (see below) in blocking solution and placed at 4�C
overnight. The next day, cells were washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min and stained with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies
at 1:400 for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark. After secondary staining, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and coverslipped with
DAPI-counterstain mounting media (Fluoromount, southern Biotech). For BORG IHC, tissue were collected and dropped-fixed in PFA
(4% w/v) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS. BORGs were then placed in sucrose solution (30%
w/v) overnight before being embedded in O.C.T (Tissue-Tek). Embedded tissue was sectioned at 20 mm using a cryostat and
mounted slides were stored at �20�C until staining. For BORG staining, mounted tissue was removed from storage and warmed
by placing at room temperature for 30 min. Tissue were rehydrated and washed with room temperature PBS (1X) 3 times for
5 min. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed by using Citrate Buffer (10mM Citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH = 6.0) at 97�C
for 20 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. After antigen retrieval, slides were washed three times with PBS. Slides
were then washed once in PBS-A solution (1X PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 15 min. Tissue was blocked using PBS-B solution
(PBS-A, 0.2% BSA, and 1.5% goat or donkey serum) for 1 hr at room temperature. After block, primary antibodies were added to
PBS-B solution (250-350 ml/ slide) at appropriate dilutions (see below) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The next
day, slides were washed with PBS-A solution 3 times for 5 min each. Tissue were blocked for 1 hr using PBS-B solution at room tem-
perature. After block, slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (all at 1:500) and Hoechst stain (1X) in
PBS-B (for 250-300 ml/slide) for 2 hr at room temperature in the dark. After secondary staining, slides were washed 5 times with PBS
for 5 min. Slides were coverslipped using fluoromount (Southern Biotech). For mouse brain IHC, brains were collected, fixed, and
processed as mentioned above. Free-floating sections were blocked in blocking solution (1X PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10%
goat serum) for 1 hr at room temperature with gentle shaking. For human TMEM119 staining, heat mediated antigen retrieval was
performed prior to blocking, as performed previously (Bennett et al., 2016). Free-floating tissue antigen retrieval was performed
by placing floating sections in a 1.5 mL micro centrifuge tube containing 1 mL of Citrate Buffer solution and placing in a pre-heated
temperature block set at 100�C. Tissue was heated for 10 min at 100�C then removed and allowed to come to room temperature for
20 min before washing with PBS 3 times for 5 min and then proceeding with blocking step. For AD mouse brain staining of amyloid
plaques, floating sections were placed in 1X Amylo-Glo RTD (Biosensis) staining solution for 10 min at room temperature without
shaking. After staining, sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 5 min each and briefly rinsed in MiliQ DI water before being placed

 back in to PBS followed by blocking. Primary antibodies were added to staining solution (1X PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1% goat
serum) at appropriate dilutions (see below) and incubated overnight at 4�C with slight shaking. The next day, sections were washed
3 times with PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:400 for 1 hr at room temperature with slight
shaking in the dark. After secondary staining, sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 5 min and mounted on glass slides. After
mounting, slides were coverslipped with DAPI-counterstain mounting media (Fluoromount, southern Biotech). Primary antibodies:
mouse anti-b3Tubulin (1:500; BioLegend, 801201), mouse anti-human Cytoplasm (SC121,1:100; Takara Bio, Y40410), mouse

Oligomeric (A11) (1:1,000, EMD Millipore, AB9234), mouse anti-Amyloid 1-16aa (6e10) (1:1,000, BioLegend, 803001).
ADP Migration and Calcium Imaging Assays
Trans-well migration assays to ADP was performed as previously described (De Simone et al., 2010; Moore et al., 2015). iMGLs
(5.5x104 cells/well) were cultured in serum-free basal media without cytokines pre-exposed to DMSO or PSB0739 (50 mM, Tocris)
for 1hr at 37�C in 5% CO2 cell culture incubator. Cells were then washed three times with basal medium and plated in trans-well
migration chambers (5 mm polycarbonate inserts in 24 wells; Corning) containing Adenosine 50-phosphate (ADP, 100 mM; Sigma)
in the bottom chamber in 37�C in 5% CO2. After 4 hr, cells were washed three times with PBS (1x) and fixed in PFA (4%) for
15 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with Hoechst stain for 10 min to visualize nuclei of cells. A blinded observer counted
total cells per slide and then scrubbed cells off top surface using a cotton-swab, washed with PBS, and recounted to record migrated
cells. Migration was reported as migrated over total cells per well. Fluorescent images of cells were captured using Olympus IX71
inverted microscope.
For calcium imaging, iMGLs were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and 1 hr later were incubated with Fura-2-AM (Mo-
lecular Probes) calcium dye diluted in Ringer solution containing (in mM): NaCl 140, KCl 4.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, glucose
10, sucrose 5, pH = 7.4. After 1 hr incubation, the dye was washed out 3 times using Ringer solution and treated for 1 hr with either
P2ry12 inhibitor PSB0739 (50 mM, Tocris) or Vehicle (DMSO) and used for experiments. Baseline Ca2+ signal (I340/I380) were measured
for more than 100 s and then ADP (10 mM) was introduced under steady flow after baseline measurement. Ca2+ recordings were per-
formed on Zeiss (Axiovert 35)-based imaging setup and data acquisition was conducted with Metafluor software (Molecular Devices).
Data analysis was performed using Metafluor, Origin Pro, and Prism 6.0.
Phagocytosis Assays
iMGLs and MD-Mf, were incubated with mouse anti CD16/32 Fc-receptor block (2 mg/ml; BD Biosciences) for 15 min at 4�C. Cells
were then stained with anti CD45-APC clone HI30 (Tonbo Biosciences) at 1:200 in flow cytometer buffer. Samples were then
analyzed using Amnis ImageStreamerX Mark II Imaging Flow Cytometer (Millipore). E.coli, human synaptosome, fAb, and BDTO
phagocytosis was analyzed using the IDEAS software onboard Internalization Wizard algorithm. Additive free Anti-CD11b antibody
(BioLegend, #301312) was used for CD11b blockade.
Fibrillar Ab Preparation
Fibrillar fluorescent amyloid-beta (fAb1-42) was generated as described previously (Koenigsknecht-Talboo and Landreth, 2005).
Fluorescently labeled Ab peptide (AnaSpec; Fremont, CA) was first dissolved in NH4OH (0.1%) to 1 mg/ml, then further diluted to
100 mg/ml using sterile endotoxin-free water, vortexed thoroughly, and incubated at 37�C for 7 days. fAb was thoroughly mixed prior
to cell exposure.
BDTO Preparation
Brain-derived tau oligomers were purified by immunoprecipitation as described previously (Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2012). Tau olig-
omers were isolated by immunoprecipitation with the T22 antibody using PBS-soluble fractions of homogenates prepared from AD
brain. These were then purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using PBS (pH 7.4). Additional analyses include western
blots to detect contamination with monomeric tau or large tau aggregates (tau-5, normally appear on top of the stacking gel) and
using a mouse anti-IgG to identify non-specific bands. BDTOs were subsequently conjugated to pHrodo-Red per manufacturer’s
protocol.
Human Synaptosomes
The synaptosome preparation protocol was adapted from (Gylys et al., 2000). Human tissue samples were obtained at autopsy and
minced, slowly frozen in 0.32 M sucrose with 10% DMSO and stored at �80 �C. To obtain a crude synaptosome fraction, tissue was
thawed in a 37 �C water bath and homogenized in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) with proteinase inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase

e8
 inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) using a glass/Teflon homogenizer (clearance 0.1–0.15 mm). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g at
4 �C for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and centrifuged again at 10,000 g at 4 �C for 20 min. Resulting pellets were suspended
in sucrose/Tris solution and stored at �80 �C. Synaptosomes were conjugated to pHrodo-Red per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Mesoscale Multiplex Cytokine and Chemokine Assay
iMGL culture media was replaced with basal media for 2 hr prior to stimulation with IFNg (20 ng/ml), IL1b (20 ng/ml), and LPS
(100 ng/ml) for 24 hr, after which cells were collected for RNA and conditioned media assessed for cytokine secretion. To simulta-
neously assess multiple cytokine and chemokine analytes from iMGL conditioned media, conditioned media from each treatment
group was processed and analyzed using the V-PLEX human cytokine 30-plex kit (Mesoscale) per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Dot Blot
Serial dilutions of proteins (2 ml) were blotted on a pre-wet nitrocellulose paper and allowed to dry. After drying, blots were blocked
with 5% BSA in 1x Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hr at room temperature with slight shaking. Next, blots were incu-
bated with primary antibodies (see below) at room temperature for 1 hr. Blots were then washed 3 times for 5 min each with TBST.
Blots were then incubated with HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) at 1:10,000 for 1 hr at room temperature with mild
shaking. After 1 hr, blots were washed 3 times for 5 min each with TBST. After wash, blots were dried on filter paper and incubated
with Pierce ECL western blotting development substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min in the dark. Blots were imaged on
ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging system (Bio-Rad).

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
RNA-Seq Analysis
RNA-seq reads were mapped to the hg38 reference genome using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) aligner and mapped to Gencode version
24 gene annotations using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Genes with expression (< 1 FPKM) across all samples were filtered from all
subsequent analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was performed on TMM normalized counts with EdgeR (Robinson et al.,
2010). Multiple biological replicates were used for all comparative analysis. A p value % 0.001 and a 2-fold change in expression were
used in determining significant differentially expressed genes for respective comparisons. PCA analysis was performed using the
R package ‘‘rgl’’ and plotted using ‘‘plot3d.’’ Clustering was performed using R ‘‘hclust2’’ and visualized using Java Tree View
3.0 (http://bonsai.hgc.jp/�mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm). Differential gene analysis between groups was performed
using the R package ‘‘limma’’ and significant genes (adjusted p < 0.01) were used for Gene ontology and pathway analysis. Gene
ontology and pathway analysis was performed using Enrichr database (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) (Chen et al., 2013; Ku-
leshov et al., 2016).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 7 software. Comparisons involving more than two groups utilized one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test and corrected p values for multiple comparisons were reported. Comparison’s with more
than two groups and comparing to a control or vehicle group utilized one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test with cor-
rected p values for multiple comparisons reported. Two-Way ANOVA were followed by Sidak’s multiple-comparison post hoc test
Comparisons of two groups utilized two-tailed Students t test. All differences were considered significantly different when
p < 0.05. Statistical analysis for RNA-sequencing is detailed above and all further statistical analysis details are reported in the figure
legends.
