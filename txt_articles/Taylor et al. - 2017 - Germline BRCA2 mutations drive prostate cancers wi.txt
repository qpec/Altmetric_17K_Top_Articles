Germline mutations in the BRCA2 tumour suppressor are associated with both an increased
lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa) and increased risk of aggressive disease.
To understand this aggression, here we profile the genomes and methylomes of localized PCa
from 14 carriers of deleterious germline BRCA2 mutations (BRCA2-mutant PCa). We show
that BRCA2-mutant PCa harbour increased genomic instability and a mutational profile that
more closely resembles metastastic than localized disease. BRCA2-mutant PCa shows
genomic and epigenomic dysregulation of the MED12L/MED12 axis, which is frequently
dysregulated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This dysregulation
is enriched in BRCA2-mutant PCa harbouring intraductal carcinoma (IDC). Microdissection
and sequencing of IDC and juxtaposed adjacent non-IDC invasive carcinoma in 10 patients
demonstrates a common ancestor to both histopathologies. Overall we show that localized
castration-sensitive BRCA2-mutant tumours are uniquely aggressive, due to de novo
aberration in genes usually associated with metastatic disease, justifying aggressive initial
treatment.

 G
ermline mutation of the BRCA2 tumour suppressor gene
substantially increases the lifetime risk of developing
prostate cancer (PCa)1,2. In BRCA2-mutation carriers,
localized PCa rapidly progresses to metastatic castrate-resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC) with 5-year cancer-specific survival
rates of B50–60% (refs 1,3,4). BRCA2-mutant tumours also
exhibit an increased frequency of intraductal carcinoma (IDC),
a pathology that predicts adverse outcome in both familial5 and
sporadic PCa6,7. Prostate tumours arising in men with an
inactivating BRCA2 germline mutation (BRCA2-mutant PCa)
are uniquely aggressive, associated with younger age of onset,
have higher rates of lymph node and distant metastasis, and
increased mortality relative to sporadic, non-BRCA2-mutant
disease3,5,6. Precision surgery or radiotherapy with curative
intent inexplicably fails, with a rapid onset of incurable mCRPC
in
BRCA2-mutant
PCa7–9.
The
molecular
origins
of
the
clinical aggressiveness of BRCA2-mutant PCa are unknown.
Understanding them may allow better treatment decision-
making;
for
example,
given
their
DNA
repair
deficient
genotype, these cancers may be amenable to treatment with
PARP inhibitors, based on genetic synthetic lethality10–12.
In this study, to identify the drivers of aggression in BRCA2-
mutant PCa, we characterized genomic alterations in localized
PCa tumour specimens from 14 men carrying a deleterious
germline mutant BRCA2 allele using either whole-genome
sequencing
(WGS)
and/or
SNP
array-based
copy-number
analyses (CNAs). We find that BRCA2-mutant PCa harbours a
mutational profile more akin to that of mCRPC than localized
sporadic PCa, and shows broad dysregulation of pathways
associated with aggressive disease, including the MED12/MED12L
axis.
Micro-dissection
and
subclonal
reconstruction
shows
distinct evolutionary trajectories and identifies a common
precursor to IDC and adjacent invasive carcinoma. Taken
together,
these
data
demonstrate
the
genomic
correlates
underlying aggressive BRCA2-mutant PCa.
Results
The Mutational Landscape of BRCA2-mutant PCa. To address
intra-prostatic and intra-lesion heterogeneity, we microdissected
regions of invasive carcinoma (IC) and of IDC from five tumours,
resulting
in
19
PCa
specimens
(Supplementary
Table
1;
Supplementary Fig. 1).
We first identified single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), genomic
rearrangements (GRs) and CNAs from these samples using
validated pipelines (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary
Fig. 2). We compared the mutational profiles of BRCA2-mutant
PCa
to
a
set
of
200
sporadic
PCa
with
whole-genome
sequencing13.
We
separated
this
comparison
cohort
into
patients 50 years of age or younger at the time of treatment
(n ¼ 8) and those older than 50 years (n ¼ 192), to control for
age effects. BRCA2-mutant PCa showed elevated genomic
instability, as measured by percent genome alteration (PGA),
an established prognostic factor for relapse in localized disease
(P ¼ 7.53 � 10 � 4;
two-sided
t-test;
Fig.
1a)14,15.
Similarly,
BRCA2-mutant tumours showed elevated numbers of SNVs and
GRs than sporadic tumours arising in either older or younger
men (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 3).
Overall,
BRCA2-mutant
PCa
shows
the
same
C-class
character16 as sporadic PCa, with a large number of CNAs and
a relative paucity of SNVs. Regions of the genome recurrently
gained or deleted in BRCA2-mutant PCa but not sporadic PCa
include a large amplification on chromosome 3q (Fig. 1b).
Genomic changes associated with aggressive disease were more
common, including gain of the MYC oncogene, which occurred
in 72% (13/18) of BRCA2-mutant PCa which was significantly
higher than the 20.1% rate in sporadic PCa of equivalent Gleason
score (57/283; P ¼ 1.42 � 10 � 3; two-sided proportion test17.
Gains in MYCN, GSK3B and MTOR were also more common
in BRCA2-mutant PCa. By contrast, losses of the tumour
suppressors TP53 and NKX3-1 occurred at similar rates in
BRCA2-mutant and sporadic PCa (Fig. 1c). Supplementary Data 1
lists all genes with differential rates of copy-number aberrations.
No individual gene was altered by SNVs in more than one
BRCA2-mutant patient (Supplementary Fig. 4). In fact, of the 11
most frequently mutated genes in a cohort of 477 sporadic
localized PCa (ref. 13), only 1 was mutated in BRCA2-mutant
PCa: TP53 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Similarly of the 32 genes
mutated in at least two BRCA2-mutant PCa, only 12 were
mutated
in
477
sporadic
PCa.
One
BRCA2-mutant
PCa
harboured a kataegic event (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Although the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion on chromosome 21
was observed at similar frequencies in BRCA2-mutant and
sporadic PCa (Fig. 2a; 3/12 versus 68/200; P ¼ 0.74, proportion
test;
Supplementary
Table
1),
we
identified
several
GRs
in
BRCA2-mutant
PCa
(Fig.
2b;
Supplementary
Fig.
7;
Supplementary Data 2). The most prominent of these was an
inversion on 3p26.1 which occurred in 4/12 BRCA2-mutant
specimens but 0/200 sporadic PCa. This region contains only
four genes: a metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM7) and two
of its antisense RNAs, along with a mitochondrial ribosomal
pseudogene.
GRM7
inactivation
suggests
loss
of
negative
regulation of NMDA signaling, as previously associated with
the neuroendocrine disease (NED) phenotype. NED commonly
arises in late-stage disease and is associated with treatment
resistance and poor prognosis18. There was also a recurrent
translocation on chromosome 7q in a non-genic region proximal
to several solute carriers and membrane proteins. BRCA2-mutant
PCa
tumours
showed
similar
chromothriptic
character
to
sporadic disease (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Surprisingly, BRCA2-mutant PCa showed global hypomethyla-
tion relative to sporadic PCa (Supplementary Fig. 9) which was
retained even after controlling for the increased CNA rate of
BRCA2-mutant PCa (Supplementary Figs 10 and 17). Overall
B1% (4,979/435,377) of copy-number neutral probes showed
differential methylation between BRCA2-mutant and sporadic
PCa specimens (Supplementary Data 3), and 74% (3,677/4,979)
of
these
were
hypomethylated,
including
21
of
the
25
most differentially methylated genes (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Differentially methylated genes in BRCA2-mutant PCa were
enriched in pathways associated with VEGF signaling, neuronal
development, and other neuronal processes characteristic of
NED (Supplementary Fig. 12; Supplementary Table 3). Other
hypomethylated NED-related genes include modulators of WNT
signaling (for example, AXIN, APC, ROCK1/2), IL6 signaling
(for example, IL6ST, BMP6), and mTOR signaling (for example,
TSC2),
and
many
of
these
genes
were
also
altered
by
CNAs (Supplementary Fig. 13). The 30 UTR of the BRCA2
locus was hypomethylated in BRCA2-mutant PCa specimens
(Supplementary Fig. 14).
MED12/MED12L amplification is associated with aggressive PCa.
To
identify
other
driver
events
that
might
help
explain
the aggressiveness of BRCA2-mutant PCa, we investigated the
amplification of a region on chromosome 3q (Fig. 1b) that is
common
in
BRCA2-mutant
PCa
(11/18;
61%),
but
rare
in sporadic PCa (55/809; 6.8% P ¼ 1.64 � 10 � 9, two-sided pro-
portion test). The consensus amplicon of this locus contains the
WNT/b-catenin pathway modulator MED12L (Supplementary
Data 4 and 7), as well as ATR, which encodes the DNA damage
response factor ataxia telangiectasia-and-Rad3 related protein.

 Importantly, the MED12L homolog, MED12 (chromosome
Xq13.1), is amplified in 44% of BRCA2-mutant PCa specimens
(8/18) compared with only B0.1% of localized sporadic PCa
(1/809, P ¼ 3.64 � 10 � 44, two-sided proportion test). Further,
MED12L (but not MED12) showed frequent amplification in
distant metastases from metastatic castrate resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC) patients (7/37 cases, 19%). Supporting this
model, four loci within the MED12L gene were significantly
hypomethylated in BRCA2-mutant versus sporadic PCa (Fig. 3a;
Supplementary Fig. 15). Consistent with their alteration at the
copy-number and methylation levels in aggressive BRCA2-
mutant PCa, MED12/MED12L are also amplified and/or show
elevated RNA expression levels in 18% (26/150) of mCRPC6 but
only 7.5% (25/333) of sporadic, localized PCa18 (P ¼ 0.002,
proportion
test).
Thus
MED12L/MED12
amplifications
are
preferentially
mutated
in
aggressive
disease—both
BRCA2-
driven primary tumours and sporadic mCRPC.
MED12L/MED12 amplification was also enriched in BRCA2-
mutant PCa harbouring IDC (6/8 IDC-positive specimens with
MED12L/MED12 gain versus 1/6 IDC negative specimens).
Importantly, these mutations are not enriched in sporadic
tumours
harbouring
IDC.
Therefore
we
evaluated
global
differences between IDC and IC. Presence of IDC in BRCA2-
mutant PCa associates with CNAs portending poor prognosis.
Several genomic regions were preferentially amplified or deleted
in tumours harbouring IDC, including gain of BCL6 and loss of
MTOR, along with gains of a region harbouring CDK2 and
ERBB3 (Fig. 3b). This underpins the observation that the presence
of IDC in BRCA2-mutant PCa associates with an aggressive
clinical course and increased PCa-specific mortality rates5.
Evolutionary trajectories of BRCA2-mutant and sporadic PCa.
Enrichment for negative prognostic factors in BRCA2-mutant
PCa harbouring IDC suggested that these tumours may have
distinct evolutionary trajectories. To assess the subclonal archi-
tectures of sporadic and BRCA2-mutant PCa harbouring IDC we
selected six sporadic PCa and microdissected the IDC and IC
components (Supplementary Fig. 16). Both components were
subjected to whole-genome sequencing and CNA profiling and
tumour phylogenies were reconstructed. This procedure was
repeated for four BRCA2-mutant PCa cases that harboured both
IDC and IC components. Reconstruction began with subclonal
CNA profiling using TITAN19, followed by clustering of SNV
frequencies with PhyloWGS20. In all four BRCA2-mutant PCa
(Fig. 4a; Supplementary Data 5) the IDC and IC components
arose from the same founding clone, with no evidence of multiple
independent tumours21. The parental population was found in
both the IDC and IC regions, providing no inference as to where
the tumour may have initiated. MYC amplifications were
observed in three of these four patients, and in each occurred
before divergence of IDC and IC components. By contrast,
MED12L gain was clonal in two samples and sub-clonal in two
others, in one case only occurring in the IC component.
In sporadic PCa with evidence of IDC (Fig. 4b; Supplementary
Data 6) there was again no evidence of multiple independent
tumours—the IDC and IC components arose from a common
ancestor
and
there
was
no
clear
evidence
as
to
which
compartment this ancestor arose in. MYC amplification was
observed in 4/6 tumours, once clonally, once in a clone only
present in IDC and twice only in a clone present in IC. NKX3-1
deletion was present in the trunk of 3/6 tumours. Intriguingly,
PIK3CA
SNVs
were
observed
in
2/6
patients
with
IDC
(once clonally and once only in the IC component), as compared
with
7/333
patients
in
the
TCGA
localized
PCa
dataset
(P ¼ 5.92 � 10 � 4; proportion test)9.
Discussion
While the clinical aggressiveness of germline BRCA2-mutant PCa
remains unexplained, it is distinguished from sporadic PCa by a
unique mutational profile. BRCA2-mutant PCa is characterized
by elevated global genomic instability, which is a well-established
biomarker of biochemical failure and metastasis14,15. BRCA2-
mutant PCa harboured specific mutations that are rarely, if ever,
observed in sporadic localized PCa. These lead to dysregulation of

 pathways associated with NED and mCRPC, despite no exposure
to androgen deprivation therapy in these patients. These
observations help rationalize our recent clinical association
between disease outcome and the presence of IDC5, in part,
with
increased
activation
of
the
MED12L/MED12
axis.
Surprisingly, and counter to previous expectations, the IDC and
IC components share a common precursor, and share a large
portion of their mutational profile.
MED12L/MED12 are components of the mediator complex
and important regulators of the WNT pathway, which has been
implicated in cell proliferation and neuroendocrine differentia-
tion in PCa22–25. The MED12L/MED12 axis is implicated in
metastatic sporadic PCa, with MED12 nuclear overexpression
common in mCRPC and localized recurrent PCa but not in
localized primary PCa or benign prostate tissue26. MED12
SNVs, which occur in both localized and advanced PCa,
are also implicated in prostate tumourigenesis27 and genome
instability28,29.
BRCA2-mutant PCa are also enriched for aberrant DNA
methylation in genes involved in neurogenesis and neuron
development, consistent with recent reports that autonomic nerve
development contributes to PCa progression and metastasis30.
Overall, our data strongly support a model in which germline
BRCA2-mutant PCa are genotypically-similar to mCRPC and
frequently harbour genomic aberrations in key pathways (for
example, WNT/APC, IL6-BMP6, mTOR, ATR, MYCN, and so
on; Supplementary Data 6; Fig. 4c) leading to genomic instability,
NED, castrate-resistance and metastasis, together explaining

Figure 4 | Evolutionary trajectory of BRCA2-mutant and sporadic PCa harbouring IDC. (a) Subclonal reconstruction of four BRCA2-mutant PCa from
microdissected IDC and IC components using CNA and SNV data. (b) Reconstructions of six sporadic PCa with microdissected IDC and IC components
using CNA and SNV data. Each tree gives the inferred phylogeny for a single patient. The gray node is the germline. Blue nodes are present in the IC
specimen, gold nodes in the IDC specimen, and the relative proportions of each reflect their relative cellular prevalence. Node size reflects the sum of the
cellular prevalence of the IDC and IC components. A set of key mutations that occur on each branch are annotated, and the length of the branch is
proportional to the number of SNVs that accumulated on it. (c) Early in the development of BRCA2-Mutant PCa, the disease is characterized by
amplifications in 3q, MED12, MED12L and MYC, global genomic instability, a global hypomethylation profile and presents as a more aggressive disease.
Tumour suppressors appear to be lost early in sporadic PCa, leading to subsequent development of global genome instability, and increased amplifications
as the disease advances.

 adverse patient prognosis. It remains to be shown if the temporal
change in genomic stability of BRCA2-mutation carrier PCa
tumours is relevant to other solid tumours with specific pre-
dispositions for aggressive disease such as those arising in breast,
colon and pancreas.
Collectively,
our
data
provide
genome-wide,
nucleotide-
resolution characterization of the molecular architecture of
localized PCa and IDC that develops in men who harbour a
mutant germline BRCA2 allele. While the population frequency is
relatively low (o1%)31, the aggressive natural history of localized
tumours may justify a change in clinical management to a more
intensified approach including upfront use of PARP inhibitors10
and chemotherapy
(for example, success of CHAARTED,
STAMPEDE trials)32 in addition to ADT to block the rapid
progression to mCRPC observed in these patients. Based on our
provocative data, trials could also explore molecular inhibition of
ATR, mTOR and GSK3A pathways in these patients, especially
when IDC is present. Our results may ultimately help to elucidate
multiple key pathways to therapeutically target men who are
carriers of a BRCA2 mutation with PCa to increase rates of cure
by preventing rapid progression to mCRPC.
Methods
Patient cohorts. Men were treated for sporadic or BRCA2-mutant PCa by radical
prostatectomy at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (University Health Network,
Toronto, Canada) or were recruited by kConfab (Kathleen Cuningham Foundation
Consortium for research into Familial Breast cancer) at the Peter MacCallum
Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia). Informed consent for analysis was obtained
through institutional Research Ethics Board protocols (UHN #11-0024 and
#11-0091-T; #97/27).
In Canada, patients with a known BRCA2 germline mutation were approached
for retrospective informed consent based on the following inclusion criteria:
(1) intermediate or high risk localized Prostate cancer, as defined by NCCN
guidelines, treated in the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre BRCA clinic;
(2) confirmed presence of primary tumour tissue in the UHN genitourinary
biobank; (3) whole blood (5 ml) was obtained at the time of consenting. Consent
was for use of tumour and normal tissues and associated DNA, RNA and protein,
including whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing of both somatic and
germline specimens.
In Australia, prostate cancer cases were identified from 1,600 families recruited
into the Kathleen Cunningham Consortium for Research into Familial Breast
Cancer (kConFab), the Australian and New Zealand consortium for families at
high-risk of breast cancer (http://www.kconfab.org). Inclusion in kConFab requires
a strong multi-case family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, or a germline
mutation in a breast cancer predisposition gene such as BRCA1and BRCA2
(see www.kconfab.org for full recruitment criteria). Male kConFab members were
eligible for inclusion in this study if: (i) they had a verified diagnosis of prostate
cancer, (ii) complete diagnostic and treatment notes were available and (iii) family
BRCA mutation status was known. Human Research Ethics Committee approval
(protocol: 97/27) was obtained from Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre to allow
recruitment of prostate cancer patients at the time of diagnosis for fresh tissue
collection or access to retrospectively archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded
tissues. A comparative cohort of patients with sporadic prostate cancer was
recruited for pathology review; these men were spouses of the multi-case breast
cancer women recruited into kConFab.
Tissue collection and microdissection. Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained sections
from fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate cancer
tissues were assessed by a clinical genitourinary pathologist (TvdK or DC). Regions
of at least 70% tumour cellularity were manually microdissected from fresh-frozen
or FFPE tissues from BRCA2 or sporadic tissues.
Copy-number profiling. Genome-wide gene CNA profiles were generated with
Affymetrix OncoScan v3 SNP microarrays. Genomic DNA was extracted
from microdissected tumour specimens using phenol:chloroform, as previously
described23), and quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer. Microarray analysis used
30–150 ng of dsDNA for each sample. Analysis of Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE
Express 3.0 SNP probe assays was performed using. OSCHP files generated by
OncoScan Console 1.1 using a custom reference when starting material was Fresh
Frozen (n ¼ 12). A custom reference which included 119 normal blood samples
from male patients with prostate cancer, 2 normal blood samples from females
with anaplastic thyroid cancer and 10 female HapMap cell line samples was created
to combat artefacts created due to the difference in sample preparation (FFPE
versus Fresh Frozen).
For FFPE samples,. OSCHP files generated by Affymetrix using their in-house
reference (n ¼ 8).
BioDiscovery’s Nexus Express for OncoScan 3 Software were used to call CNAs
with the SNP-FASST2 algorithm. Default parameters were used, except that the
minimum number of probes per segment was changed from 3 to 10. When
necessary, samples were re-centered using the Nexus Express software, choosing
regions that showed diploid log2ratio and B allele frequency profiles (n ¼ 2). Gene
level copy-number aberrations for each patient were identified by overlapping CN
segments with RefGene annotation using BEDTools (v2.17.0)33. Tumour purity
was assessed computationally (Supplementary Fig. 15). PGA was calculated for
each sample by dividing the number of base-pairs that are involved in a
copy-number change by the total length of the genome.
To discover differences in copy-number states between germline BRCA2
mutated samples (n ¼ 14) and sporadic samples (n ¼ 284) two-sided proportion
tests were performed as implemented in R (v3.1.3). A ‘by bvote’ profile was created
for patients with both IDC and IC samples. When the copy-number state per
gene differed between samples, gain and deletions were kept over neutral states.
Copy-number segment data was mapped to the RefGene annotation, classifying
each gene’s state as ‘amplification, ‘deletion’ or ‘neutral’ and then amplifications
and deletions were grouped together for this analysis. P values were FDR adjusted
to account for multiple testing. Two-sided, unpaired t-tests were performed to
test differences in PGA between BRCA2 and sporadic samples implemented in
R (v3.1.3).
The copy-number states of specific prognostic genes were investigated to
determine if the frequency differed between samples that had an IDC component
and those that did not. Samples that had both IDC and IC specimens were
combined to get a ‘complete’ profile, in which the union of all aberrations was
taken. Only CNAs that are in the same state (amplification versus deletion) as
known prognostic genes are shown. For example if a specimen has amplification of
NKX3-1, it will not be shown, as only NKX3-1 deletions have prognostic value.
A Wilcoxon test was performed comparing the rank sum of CNAs in three
prognostic genes (that is, NXK3-1, MYC, PTEN) between patients with IDC and
those without.
Whole-genome sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on
Illumina HiSeq 2,500 instruments at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.
Sequencing libraries were prepared on 150 ng of input genomic DNA, as previously
reported21. Tumour and normal DNA were sequenced to target depths of
50 � and 30 � , respectively (actual sequencing depths shown in Supplementary
Table 1).
Whole-genome sequencing data analysis. Each lane of raw sequencing reads
was aligned against human reference build GRCh37 with decoy (hs37d5) using bwa
(v0.7.11)34. Lane level BAMs from the same library were merged, marking
duplicates using picard (v1.92). Library level BAMs from each sample were merged
without marking duplicates. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK v2.4.9) was
used for local realignment and base quality recalibration, processing tumour/
normal pairs together35. Separate tumour and normal sample level BAMs were
extracted, headers were corrected using samtools (v0.1.9)36 and files were indexed
with picard (v1.107). To evaluate cross-individual contamination, ContEst
(v1.0.24530) was used for all the normal and tumour sequences37. Both the sample
and lane-level analysis were performed and confirmed no significant
contamination. Regarding the required input VCFs, genotype information was
gained from the germline SNVs generated by GATK (v2.4.9) and the VCF for
population allele frequencies for each SNP in HapMap (hg19) was downloaded
from https://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/contest_download.
Somatic SNVs were predicted using SomaticSniper (v1.0.2)38. First, somatic
SNV candidates were detected using bam-somaticsniper with the default
parameters except -q option (mapping quality threshold). The -q was set to 1
instead of 0 as recommended by the developer. To filter the candidate SNVs,
a pileup indel file was generated for both normal BAM and tumour BAM file using
SAMtools (v0.1.6). The SomaticSniper package provides a series of Perl scripts to
filter out possible false positives (http://gmt.genome.wustl.edu/somatic-sniper/
1.0.3/documentation.html). First, standard and LOH filtering were performed
using the pileup indel files and then, bam-readcount filter was also performed
(bam-readcount downloaded on 10 January 2014) with a mapping quality filter -q
1 (otherwise default settings). In addition, we ran the false positive filter.
Subsequently, a high confidence filter was used with the default parameters.
The final VCF file that contains high confidence somatic SNVs was used in the
downstream analysis.
After somatic SNV calling using SomaticSniper, identified SNVs were passed
through an annotation pipeline. SNVs were functionally annotated by ANNOVAR
(v2015-06-17)39, using the RefGene database (downloaded on 2014-07-15).
Nonsynonymous, stop-loss, stop-gain and splice-site SNVs (based on RefGene
annotations) were considered functional. If more than one mutation is found in a
sample for a gene, then the mutation of the higher priority functional class was
used for visualization. SNVs were filtered using tabixpp
(3b299cc0911debadc435fdae60bbb72bd10f6d84), removing SNVs found in any of
the following databases: dbSNP141 (modified to remove somatic and clinical
variants, with variants with the following flags excluded: SAO ¼ 2/3, PM, CDA,

 TPA, MUT and OM)40, 1,000 Genomes Project (v3), Complete Genomics 69 whole

Consensus Excludable databases (comprising poorly mapping reads, repeat regions,
and mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA)42, invalidated somatic SNVs from 68
human colorectal cancer exomes (unpublished data) using the AccuSNP platform
(Roche NimbleGen), germline SNVs from 477 sporadic PCa patients with the
intermediate GS (3 þ X and X þ 3) and additional 10 prostate cancer patients with
higher GS13, and the Fuentes database of likely false positive variants43. SNVs were
whitelisted (and retained, independently of the presence in other filters) if they
were contained within the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)
database (v70)44.
SNV mutation load. To find the total number of bases somatic SNVs can be called
on, each position in the reference was classified as ‘callable’ or not. Positions were
considered callable in a sample if it has a minimum coverage of 10 � in normal
and 17 � in the tumour as calculated using BEDTools (v2.18.2)33. Mutation load
for each sample was then calculated as the number of somatic SNVs divided by the
total number of callable bases and converted to per mega-basepair of sequence.
Mutation load was not calculated for samples missing a normal specimen to avoid
upwards bias on estimated mutation rates.
Genomic rearrangements. For each patient, aligned tumour and normal BAM
files were used to call structural variants with Delly (v0.5.5)45 at a minimum
median mapping quality of 20 and a paired-end cut-off of five. A list of somatic
variants were produced by removing germline mutations from the resulting VCF
files, which were further filtered using a consolidated list of structural variants from
124 normal samples. To identify genes affected by the genomic rearrangements,
bed files were generated for each sample from deleted regions, and breakpoints
from inversions, inter-chromosomal translocations, and tandem duplications. The
resultant bed files were examined with SnpEff (v3.5)46 and gene names were
subsequently extracted for downstream analyses. Recurrent translocation events
were visualized using Circos (v0.67-4)47. Input files were bed files containing paired
translocation breakpoints and the number of samples the event was observed.
Differentially aberrant regions between sporadic and BRCA2 patients were
identified by first dividing the genome into mega-basepair bins, and tabulating the
number of samples with a deletion, translocation or inversion breakpoint in each
bin. Subsequently, a difference in proportions test was performed for each bin and
the resultant P values were corrected for multiple comparisons with FDR. Entire
chromosomes containing mega-basepair bins with significantly different
proportions of breakpoints were visualized using Circos (v0.67-4)47.
Chromothripsis detection. ShatterProof48 was used with default settings to
examine the presence of chromothripsis through the analysis of copy-number
aberrations, loss of heterozygosity, and genomic translocations, and duplications.
Samples with a maximum ShatterProof score of at least 0.517 were defined as
having chromothriptic characteristics.
Subclonal reconstruction. For each of the four BRCA2-mutant PCa and six
sporadic PCa subjects with microdissected IDC and IC components, phylogenetic
trees were constructed using the predicted SNVs and CNAs inferred by TITAN19.
TITAN was run, from a range of one to five clonal clusters, on each sample and the
CNA segments associated with the run having lowest S_Dbw validity index was
used for further analysis. Using the predicted SNVs, a multi-sample PhyloWGS20
run was conducted on each subject to cluster the SNV frequencies. PhyloWGS
Witness was used to view and determine the consensus phylogenetic tree from the
many sampled trees, summarizing the co-evolution of IDC and IC (Fig. 4;
Supplementary Data 5 and 6) from the normal sample (gray). For each tree, blue
denotes IC while gold denotes IDC, and the relative proportions of each reflect
their relative cellular prevalence. Node size reflects the sum of the cellular
prevalence of the IDC and IC components. Length of the branch is proportional to
the number of SNVs that accumulated on it, while its width is scaled to the cellular
prevalence of the new arising node. Validated pipelines identified recurrent
mutations across the samples and using the gene list associated with the top
PhyloWGS tree, key SNV mutations (green) were annotated along the branches.
With OncoScan runs as a reference, TITAN’s subclonal CNAs and their inferred
cellular prevalence identified a set of key driver genes, both gains (red) and losses
(blue) along these branches, whereas parsimony was assumed.
Methylation microarray data analysis. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation
450 k BeadChip kits were used to assess global methylation, using 500 ng of input
genomic DNA at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre
(Montreal, QC). This study comprises 10 BRCA2-mutant and 104 sporadic samples
from 8 processing batches. All methylation analysis was performed in R statistical
environment (v3.2.1). The IDAT files were loaded and converted to raw intensity
with the use of the wateRmelon package (v1.6.0)49 from the BioConductor (v3.0)
open-source project. Quality control was conducted using the minfi package
(v1.12.0)50 (no outlier samples were detected). Batch effects were also examined
across 5 batches (BRCA2 versus sporadic samples) using the mclust package
(v5.0.2) and no batch effects were found (Adjusted Rand Index ¼ 0.070). Raw
methylation intensity levels were then pre-processed using Dasen. Probe filtering
was conducted after the normalization. For each probe, a detection p-value is
computed to indicate whether the signal for the corresponding genomic position is
distinguishable from the background noise. Probes having 1% of samples with a
detection p-value greater than 0.05 were removed (2,816 probes). We also filtered
probes based on SNPs (65 probes) and non-CpG methylation probes (2,944
probes). Next, we used the DMRcate package (v1.2.0)51 to further filter out 27,296
probes that are known to cross-hybridize to multiple locations in the genome and
17,079 probes that contain a SNP with an annotated minor allele frequency of
greater than 5% with a maximum distance of two nucleotides to the nearest CpG
site. Average intensity levels were taken for technical replicates. Probes showing
differential methylations between BRCA and sporadic samples (age450 years)
were identified using the DMRcate package. Probes were deemed to be significantly
differentially methylated based on qo0.05, |log2 FC| of b-values40.1, and CNA
status. The fraction of patients having a CNA event (whether it is a gain or loss) is
calculated and only probes with fraction CNAo0.1 were kept. Next, probes were
annotated to their respective gene symbols via IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.
ilmn12.hg19 (v0.2.1) annotation package, resulting in 2,624 unique genes; this gene
list showing differential methylations were analysed using g:GOSt in the g:profiler
web database (build: 2014-04-11)52. Significantly enriched pathways (Po0.05;
hypergeometric test), as an output from g:profiler52, were then visualized
using Cytoscape (v3.3.0)53. Tumour purities for all the samples were assessed
with LUMP54.
Public data analysis. To assess the occurrence of MED12/MED12L amplifications
in sporadic and mCRPC relative to BRCA2-mutant cancers, we downloaded
publically available gene copy-number data from TCGA9 (n ¼ 203), Baca55
(n ¼ 57), Barbieri56 (n ¼ 109) and Taylor8 (sporadic, n ¼ 157; mCRPC, n ¼ 37).
To assess the relationship between RNA expression and MED12L/MED12
amplification, we queried cBioPortal for the presence of RNA over-expression
(z-score4±2.0) and amplification of one or both of these genes in two studies for
which both RNA-seq and CNA data were available: Robinson et al.7 (mCRPC) and
TCGA9 (localized sporadic PCa). A case was counted as positive if either RNA was
overexpressed or the gene was amplified.
Data availability. Raw sequencing and SNP microarray data from this study is
available at EGA under the study accession EGAS00001001615. Methylation data
from this study is available at GEO under accession GSE80685. Methylation data
