Abstract
Objective—To study resting cerebral blood flow in children and adults with developmental 
stuttering.
Methods—We acquired pulsed arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging data in 26 
participants with stuttering and 36 healthy, fluent controls. While covarying for age, sex, and IQ, 
we compared perfusion values voxel-wise across diagnostic groups and assessed correlations of 
perfusion with stuttering severity within the stuttering group and with measures of motor speed in 
both groups.
Results—We detected lower regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) at rest in the stuttering group 
compared to healthy controls in Broca’s area bilaterally and the superior frontal gyrus. rCBF 
values in Broca’s area bilaterally correlated inversely with the severity of stuttering and extended

 posteriorly into other portions of the language loop. We also found increased rCBF in cerebellar 
nuclei and parietal cortex in the stuttering group compared to healthy controls. Findings were 
unchanged in child-only analyses and when excluding participants with comorbid illnesses or 
those taking medication.
Conclusions—rCBF is reduced in Broca’s region in persons who stutter. More severe stuttering 
is associated with even greater reductions in rCBF to Broca’s region, additive to the underlying 
putative trait reduction in rCBF relative to control values. Moreover, a greater abnormality in rCBF 
in the posterior language loop is associated with more severe symptoms, suggesting that a 
common pathophysiology throughout the language loop likely contributes to stuttering severity.

Introduction
Stuttering is a disorder of speech fluency. Manifestations include repetition of a sound, 
syllable, or one-syllable word, silent or audible prolongation, or both (Wingate, 1964). The 
lifespan incidence of stuttering is approximately 5%, though recent evidence suggests that it 
may be higher. The average lifespan prevalence is about 1%, though it may be lower per 
recent data (Yairi and Ambrose, 2013). Onset is typically in early childhood, with gradual 
attenuation in the frequency and severity of stuttering ultimately leading to recovery years 
later. Adult persistence is noted in less than 25% of those affected (Yairi and Ambrose, 
1999). Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), task-based functional MRI (fMRI), 
and resting state fMRI investigations of stuttering have noted abnormalities in widely 
distributed brain regions (Chang, et al., 2009; Choo, et al., 2011; Kell, et al., 2009; Liu, et 
al., 2014; Lu, et al., 2012).
Task-based fMRI studies of stuttering have several limitations. First, the only brain regions 
interrogated are those that subserve the task. Second, the scientific utility of the activation 
map depends on selection of a pathogenically relevant activation paradigm. Third, 
participants of differing ages in task-based fMRI studies often use different strategies to 
perform the task, or they differ systematically in their cognitive and emotional responses to 
variations in task performance, creating systematic age-related differences in activation that 
have little or no relevance to the task itself (Horga, et al., 2014). The effects of differences in 
task performance therefore are confounded with age effects on task-based fMRI activation.
In contrast, measures of regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) are a convenient surrogate 
measure of brain activity because blood flow is typically tightly coupled with neural activity. 
Consequently, rCBF measures can be acquired at rest, independent of any activation 
paradigm, making them potentially more useful than task-based fMRI for developmental 
studies; moreover, they are available from almost all brain regions simultaneously, at least 
when using modern measurement techniques. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies 
have reported perfusion-based measures of rCBF in developmental stuttering.

 Based on theoretical models and findings in prior brain imaging studies of stuttering (Beal, 
et al., 2013; Beal, et al., 2015; Bode, et al., 2011; Cai, et al., 2014; Chang, et al., 2015; 
Cykowski, et al., 2010; Lu, et al., 2010; Salmelin, et al., 2000; Sommer, et al., 2002; Wu, et 
al., 1995), we had strong a priori hypotheses about the primacy of Broca’s region and, 
secondarily, of related regions in the language circuit in the pathogenesis of developmental 
stuttering. We hypothesized that we would detect reduced perfusion in brain regions 
involved in various stages of speech production, including sensory feedback, phonological 
encoding, and motor planning and programming.
Methods
Participants
We recruited 26 participants with developmental stuttering via advertisements posted on the 
internet and at local clinics, hospitals, and stuttering support groups. A licensed speech-
language pathologist diagnosed all participants with stuttering prior to enrollment in the 
study. We administered Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Present 
and Lifetime Version to diagnose comorbid disorders in stuttering participants under age 18 
(Kaufman, et al., 1997). We administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR 
Axis I Disorders to diagnose comorbid disorders in stuttering participants over 18 (First, et 
al., 2003). We allowed inclusion of participants with comorbidities because these are highly 
prevalent in stuttering speakers in general, and excluding those with comorbid illnesses 
would have impaired the generalizability of our findings. We evaluated stuttering severity on 
the day of MRI scan using the Assessment of the Child’s Experience of Stuttering (ACES) 
for children (Yaruss et al. 2006), and the Overall Assessment of the Speaker’s Experience of 
Stuttering (OASES) for adults (Yaruss and Quesal, 2006). Stuttering severity ranged from 
mild to severe, with an average severity of 46.8, in the moderate range. We recruited 36 
fluent controls randomly from a telemarketing list of 10,000 names in the local community, 
excluding those with lifetime Axis I disorders or any language disorders, and group-
matching to the stutterers on age and sex.
In all participants we estimated IQ using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence 
(Wechsler, 1981) the Edinburgh Inventory to measure the laterality of handedness (Oldfield, 
1971), and Hollingshead’s four-factor index to measure socioeconomic status (Hollingshead, 
1975). Participants, both stutterers and fluent controls, performed several other 
neuropsychological tasks, including three that are thought to index one or more aspects of 
cerebral lateralization (desirable because language is thought to be lateralized): (1) A finger-
tapping task, which involved pressing a key on a personal computer (PC) with the index 
finger as rapidly as possible in a 10-second period; each participant underwent a total of 10 
trials using the dominant and nondominant hands alternately (Reitan and Wolfson, 1985). (2) 
A line bisection task using the dominant and nondominant hands separately, and a motor-
free assessment using visual inspection, as previously described (Jewell and McCourt, 
2000). (3) The Purdue pegboard test (Tiffin and Asher, 1948). Additional exclusionary 
criteria for all participants were: a history of premature birth, prior head trauma with loss of 
consciousness, past seizures, mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorders, or 
chronic medical illness. The Institutional Review Board of the New York State Psychiatric

written informed consent from all adult participants and the parents of child participants. 
Children also provided written assent.
MRI Scanning
Images were acquired on a GE Signa 3T (Tesla) HDx system with an 8-channel, receive-
only head coil. We optimized our Pulsed Arterial Spin Labeling (PASL) perfusion sequence 
for parallel imaging at 3T using a PICORE (Proximal Inversion with Control for Off-
Resonance Effects) QUIPSS II (Quantitative Imaging of Perfusion using a Single 
Subtraction) pulse sequence (Wong, et al., 1998). We placed a 9-cm tagging slab 16-mm 
below the proximal edge of the imaging volume. To control for the off-resonance effects of 
the inversion pulses used for acquiring the labeled images, we acquired the control images 
by applying off-resonance adiabatic hyperbolic secant RF pulse with the same frequency 
offset as that for the labeled images without the slice-selective gradient. We used a single-
shot gradient-echo EPI (echo planar imaging) sequence for image acquisition, with time to 
QUIPSS saturation TI1=600 ms, and inversion time of the first slice TI2=1300 ms. 
Acquisition parameters were: FOV 24 cm, 64×64 matrix, TE(echo time)/TR (repetition 
time)=24/2300ms, flip angle 90°, slice thickness 6 mm, inter-slice spacing 0.5 mm, for a 
nominal spatial resolution of 3.75×3.75×6.5 mm. We acquired 18 slices from inferior to 
superior in sequential order. Each ASL scan with 151 acquisitions plus 5 dummies required 
5 min 59 sec. We used gradient-echo EPI with TR=15 sec at the same resolution and slice 
positions as the ASL scan to quantify signal from white matter (M0_WM) (Wong, et al., 
1998).
Image Preprocessing
In native imaging space we aligned the PASL brain images and the M0_WM image to the first 
PASL image for each participant to correct for head motion. We subsequently smoothed the 
coregistered PASL images using a Gaussian kernel of 6mm Full Width at Half Maximum 
(FWHM) to remove spatial noise and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in the images. The 
choice of a moderate 6 mm FWHM spatial filter was based on our desire to avoid loss of 
spatial precision in locating our effects of interest. We generated a brain mask for each 
participant based on the mean PASL image.
Image Analysis
Maps of rCBF—For each participant we constructed a voxel-wise map of rCBF from the 
PASL time series and M0_WM image using in-house software, as follows: (1) We pair-wise 
subtracted the control images from the labeled images; (2) From the average of the 
subtracted images, we calculated rCBF at each voxel using the following equation: 
 where ΔI is the image difference obtained in step 
1; α is the tagging efficiency, for which we used the default value of 1.0; and T1B is the T1 
of blood, for which we used the default value of 1664msec (Lu, et al., 2004); M0_B is the 
MR signal from a voxel filled with arterial blood, which was estimated from the M0_WM 
map according to M0_B = rM0_WMe(1/T2WM–1/T2B)TE where r is the proton density ratio of

 blood, for which we used the default value of 1.06; and where the default values for T2WM 
and T2B were 80msec and 200msec, respectively (Alsop and Detre, 1996; Jarnum, et al., 
2010; Wong, et al., 1998).
Statistical Analysis of rCBF Maps—We used SPM-8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping) 
to coregister the anatomical brain images to the corresponding mean rCBF images for each 
participant using a 6 degrees-of-freedom linear transformation. We then coregistered the 
rCBF images for each participant to the canonical avg152T1_brain template, resampled with 
a voxel size of 3×3×3 mm3 in SPM, using each participant’s anatomical brain image as an 
intermediary source. The canonical avg152T1_brain is an average template derived from 
MRI’s of 152 healthy persons (18.5–43.5 years of age, average 24.5 years) in the 
International Consortium for Brain Mapping database (Fonov, et al., 2011; Mazziotta, et al., 
1995).
First-Level Maps of Normalized rCBF: For each participant, we averaged the spatially 
normalized rCBF maps across time, which produced a mean rCBF map. We converted this 
mean rCBF map into a Z-score map by subtracting from the rCBF value at each voxel the 
global mean across all voxels of the mean rCBF map and then dividing by the standard 
deviation across all voxels of the mean rCBF map. The purpose of transforming the raw 
mean rCBF map into a Z-score rCBF map was to provide rCBF maps that have the same 
mean and standard deviation across individuals, which emphasizes the location of individual 
rCBF values across the brain and improves our statistical power to detect effects of interest 
within and between diagnostic groups. It also obviated the need to include global CBF 
measures as covariates in statistical analyses.
Second-Level Maps of Group Differences: All group-level statistical analyses employed a 
general linear model (GLM), implemented in SPM8, at each voxel of the spatially 
normalized, individual Z-score rCBF maps, while covarying for age and sex. Our primary a 
priori analysis compared rCBF across diagnostic groups. To correct for multiple 
comparisons across voxels, we used Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations) 
implemented in customized, MATLAB-based software to determine the cluster extent 
threshold (55 voxels in resampled space, assuming an individual voxel type I error of 
p=0.05) that yielded a corrected a priori significance threshold of p<0.05 in all of our Z-
score rCBF maps (Forman, et al., 1995). This between-group statistical map is shown under 
the column heading of “Group difference” in Figure 1. As an aid for understanding the 
group difference maps, we also created maps comparing Z-score rCBF values within each 
diagnostic group against a value of zero, indicating where in the brain the normalized Z-
score rCBF values were significantly nonzero. These within-group statistical maps are 
shown under the column headings of “Stutterers” and “Controls” in Figure 1. They were 
used to indicate visually whether the statistically significant differences in the between-
group comparison maps (the first column in Figure 1) derived from larger or smaller overall 
Z-score rCBF values in one group or the other (the second and third columns in Figure 1).

 Results
Sample Characteristics
Our groups were generally well matched on demographic characteristics, including age, sex, 
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and handedness. [Table 1] However, controls had slightly 
higher, but statistically significant, full scale IQ scores than did the stutterers. Five stuttering 
participants had one comorbid disorder each, including attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder combined type (N=2), social anxiety disorder (N=1), chronic motor tics (N=1), and 
mild Tourette syndrome (N=1).
Group Comparison of Perfusion Values
rCBF values at rest were lower in Broca’s area (p<0.0043) and the superior frontal gyrus 
(p<0.0015) in the stuttering group compared to fluent controls (p < 0.0001) [Table 2]. Values 
were higher in cerebellar nuclei (p<0.0002) and the parietal cortex in the stuttering group 
(p< 0.0001). Our findings remained consistent when including only children (age < 20) in 
the analyses [figure e-1, table e-1]. rCBF values in the basal ganglia did not differ 
significantly between the two groups, although resting rCBF values in the basal ganglia were 
low in both groups, limiting our ability to detect group differences.
Within-Group Correlations
rCBF values in Broca’s area correlated inversely with the severity of stuttering measured 
using subscales I and V (total severity) of the ACES and OASES (r=0.67; df=25; p<0.0001) 
(Figure 1) and were consistent with correlations for the other subscales as well (not shown). 
The findings remained unchanged in analyses of children alone. Inverse correlations of 
perfusion with severity of stuttering extended posteriorly into the arcuate fasciculus within 
the superior temporal and inferior parietal cortex, and into Wernicke’s area.
Potential Confounds
Our findings did not change upon statistical covariation for IQ. Additionally, our findings 
remained consistent when excluding the 5 stuttering participants who had comorbid illnesses 
or when excluding 2 stuttering participants who were taking medications.
Neuropsychological Measures
Thirty-eight participants (22 stutterers and 16 fluent controls) from the 62 total participants 
underwent neuropsychological testing. Post-hoc analyses for these 38 participants revealed 
positive correlations of rCBF with finger tapping speed for the dominant hand in 
contralateral sensory and motor language areas (left inferior temporal, left insula, left middle 
temporal), while covarying for age, sex, and diagnostic group (p<0.01) [Fig. 2]. We also 
detected significant inverse correlations of rCBF with finger tapping speed for the dominant 
hand in bilateral sensorimotor areas cephalad to the language regions (right operculum, left 
rolandic, right parietal cortex) (p<0.01) [Fig. 2]. We did not detect significant correlations 
for finger tapping speed in the nondominant hand or for scores on the Purdue pegboard or 
line bisection tasks.

 Discussion
This study is, to our knowledge, the first to use perfusion MRI to investigate differences in 
brain activity in persons who stutter. We found reduced rCBF at rest in Broca’s area 
bilaterally and the superior frontal gyrus in the stuttering group compared to healthy 
controls. rCBF values in Broca’s area correlated inversely with the severity of stuttering and 
extended posteriorly into other portions of the language loop. We also found increased rCBF 
in the stuttering group compared to healthy controls in cerebellar nuclei and the parietal 
cortex. All findings were unchanged in children-only analyses. The consistency of findings 
across ages suggests that reduced rCBF in Broca’s region may represent a stable trait 
vulnerability, without which stuttering may not manifest. The inverse correlations of 
perfusion with stuttering severity suggest that more severe stuttering is associated with even 
greater reductions in rCBF to Broca’s region and posterior portions of the language loop, 
additive to the underlying putative trait reduction in rCBF relative to control values.
Broca’s area is a key component of the neural network for speech production. Cortical 
stimulation studies in monkeys and humans point to a critical role for Broca’s in the 
planning of fine movements necessary for speech production (Luders, et al., 1995). 
Additionally, intracranial recordings have documented its participation in phonological and 
syntactic processing, and in lexical retrieval (Sahin, et al., 2009). Reduced rCBF in Broca’s 
region could therefore disrupt motor planning, phonological and syntactic processing, and 
lexical retrieval, leading to speech dysfluency. Severity correlations extended posteriorly into 
adjacent tissue of the arcuate fasciculus, suggesting that when tissue disturbances present in 
Broca’s region extend posteriorly into the arcuate fasciculus, function of the language circuit 
worsens to produce more severe symptoms.
Post-hoc analysis correlating rCBF with measures of motor performance in all participants 
supported interpretations of our primary findings. Positive correlations of finger tapping 
speed using the dominant hand with rCBF in contralateral sensory and motor language areas 
suggests that better motor performance accompanies greater rCBF in language regions, and 
that reduced rCBF in language regions in stutterers represents relative impairment in 
planning and execution of not only speech actions, but also simple sensorimotor processes 
more generally. Inverse correlations of rCBF with finger tapping speed for the dominant 
hand in bilateral sensorimotor areas cephalad to the language regions suggests that speed on 
this simple motor task is greater in persons who require relatively less rCBF in sensorimotor 
cortices to generate comparable levels of motor performance and who therefore are more 
efficient in neural processing within their sensorimotor cortices.
Our findings are generally consistent with other neuroimaging studies that have reported 
abnormalities in Broca’s region in stuttering, including altered gray and white matter 
composition (Beal, et al., 2013; Beal, et al., 2015; Lu, et al., 2010), reduced fractional 
anisotropy on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Cai, et al., 2014; Chang, et al., 2015; 
Cykowski, et al., 2010; Sommer, et al., 2002), decreased connectivity on fMRI (Bode, et al., 
2011), decreased glucose metabolism on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) (Wu, et al., 1995), and aberrant activation on magnetoencephalography (MEG) 
(Salmelin, et al., 2000). Several of these prior studies have reported predominantly

 lateralized findings (De Nil, et al., 2000; De Nil, et al., 2003; Fox, et al., 2000; Ingham, et 
al., 2004). A seminal PET study, for example, reported increased activation in the right 
hemisphere in stuttering adult men (Fox, et al., 1996), consistent with the longstanding 
theory that abnormal hemispheric lateralization is the cause of developmental stuttering 
(Kushner, 2012). Several imaging studies have subsequently suggested, however, that 
lateralized activation could represent a compensatory brain response to the presence of 
stuttering (Braun, et al., 1997; Preibisch, et al., 2003; Sowman, et al., 2014). We suspect that 
we detected significant reductions in rCBF to Broca’s region bilaterally, rather than 
unilaterally, because our findings represent a trait-like vulnerability to stuttering, rather than 
a compensatory response to its presence. This interpretation is consistent with findings from 
a prior anatomical imaging study that reported bilateral trait-like abnormalities in the 
language system in both symptomatic and recovered children with developmental stuttering 
(Chang, et al., 2008).
Animal studies have provided indirect evidence of the key role of speech motor areas in 
learning and production of stereotyped song, with dysfunction in these regions leading to 
song dysfluency. Song speed slows if the premotor nucleus of the High Vocal Center (HVC, 
the songbird equivalent to Broca’s area) is cooled (Long and Fee, 2008). Bilateral ablation 
of the medial HVC induces a positive disruption of song (an increase in atypical sequences 
of syllables), whereas bilateral ablation of the lateral HVC induces a negative disruption 
(omission of one or more syllables) (Basista, et al., 2014). Bilateral lesions of the thalamic 
nucleus Uvaeformis (Uva) in songbirds prevent proprioceptive feedback from reaching the 
HVC and affects the timing and sequencing of note delivery but not the production of 
sounds, reinforcing belief that the learned patterns for these syllables reside in the HVC and 
RA (robustus archipallium, the equivalent of face-motor cortex) (Nottebohm and Liu, 2010). 
The HVC contains inhibitory interneurons and two classes of excitatory neurons that project 
to the RA and Area X (a basal ganglia equivalent) (Mooney and Prather, 2005). Excitatory 
projection neurons during song production fire in phasic bursts that are tightly and precisely 
locked to song motifs, while the interneurons are active throughout the song (Kozhevnikov 
and Fee, 2007). Lower rCBF in Broca’s area in our stuttering participants, when interpreted 
most parsimoniously in light of these animal models of song dysfluency, likely represents 
reduced firing of excitatory neurons that produces speech dysfluency.
Intraoperative subcortical mapping with electrical stimulation has recently identified the 
frontal aslant tract, a deep frontal pathway that connects Broca’s area to the superior frontal 
gyrus, which is responsible for speech initiation and spontaneity. Lesions of this tract 
produce speech slowing and arrest (Fujii, et al., 2015). Our findings of decreased rCBF in 
the region of superior frontal gyrus may reflect tissue disturbances in the aslant tract. 
Neuroimaging and lesion studies suggest that the cerebellar nuclei contribute to speech 
motor control (Marien, et al., 2014). Increased cerebellar rCBF in our stuttering group could 
represent a compensatory response for the presence of motor-based dysfluency based within 
Broca’s region and related language circuits. Similarly, increased rCBF in parietal cortex 
may represent the use of higher-order, multisensory integration processes to compensate for 
dysfluencies in our stuttering group, given that functional MRI studies have shown extensive 
connections of parietal cortex with the primary sensorimotor areas involved in speech 
production (Fuertinger, et al., 2015). Abnormal rCBF in areas beyond the sensorimotor

 language systems suggests the involvement of networks beyond the key anatomical areas 
responsible for normal speech production.
Our study has several limitations. First, the age range of stuttering participants was wide. We 
do not believe that the wide age range compromised our findings because our statistical 
analyses covaried for age, and our results were unchanged when including only children in 
the analyses. Moreover, we included both children and adults by design, so as to aid 
identification of trait-like abnormalities in rCBF, which should be age-independent. Second, 
we studied these language-based systems at rest, not when taxing them with a relevant task. 
Again, however, this was by design, because resting measures are more appropriate for 
developmental studies, as they do not conflate measures of task performance with age or 
with trait abnormalities. Third, the pulsed ASL sequence used for image acquisition 
employed gradient recalled Echo Planar Imaging (ge-EPI). This sequence produces signal 
drop-out in several key areas, including orbitofrontal cortex and inferior basal ganglia. 
Future ASL studies in stuttering populations should employ pulse sequences that do not 
suffer from this localized signal drop-out. Fourth, we did not register the images of our 
children and adult participants to separate, age-appropriate templates (Fonov, et al., 2011), 
as doing so would have precluded analysis of our data across all participants in our study. 
Moreover, the template we used is an average from 152 mostly young adult participants; the 
averaging introduces smoothing that should render inconsequential the distinction of this 
template from a pediatric template. Finally, we assessed the severity of stuttering based on 
the ACES and OASES, subjective measures of sustained dysfluency over time, rather than 
on potentially more transient measures of dysfluency made from short-duration speech 
samples. Nevertheless, future studies of stuttering should include objective measures of 
dysfluency.

 Figure 1. Group differences and severity correlations
The right sides of the images correspond to the right side of the brain.
Left Panel: The first column represents the statistically significant differences in rCBF Z-
score perfusion values between the stuttering group and the fluent controls while covarying 
for age and sex of the participants, displayed at a threshold of p<0.05 after correction for 
multiple comparisons. Voxels in blue indicate reduced perfusion values in the stuttering 
group, and voxels in red indicate increased perfusion values, relative to controls. Perfusion 
values at rest in the stuttering group were lower bilaterally in Broca’s area and the superior 
frontal gyrus, and higher in cerebellar nuclei and the parietal cortex, compared to fluent 
controls. The second and third columns show the color-coded maps of p-value significance 
levels comparing individual-level rCBF Z-score perfusion values against a value of zero in a 
general linear model applied within the stuttering and control groups separately, thresholded 
at Z = 1.65, corresponding to p = 0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons. The 
vertically aligned z-values at the left side of the figure represent slice level (in millimeters) 
in the Montreal Neurological Institute coordinate system.
Right Panel: Voxels in blue represent inverse correlations, and voxels in red represent 
positive correlations, between rCBF Z-score perfusion values and stuttering severity scores, 
displayed at a threshold of p<0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons. Perfusion 
values in Broca’s area correlated inversely with the severity of stuttering. Stuttering severity

 Figure 2. Correlations of perfusion values with dominant hand finger tapping speed
These correlation analyses included 38 participants (22 stutterers and 16 fluent controls, 
those who had finger tapping scores from the 62 total participants). The maps reveal positive 
correlations of rCBF Z-score values with Z-scores for finger tapping speed in the dominant 
hand that were located in contralateral sensory and motor language areas (Fig. 2). The 
correlations covaried for age, sex, and diagnostic group, and are displayed at a threshold of 
p<0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons. We also detected significant inverse 
correlations of perfusion with finger tapping speed for the dominant hand in bilateral 
sensorimotor areas cephalad to the language regions. Scatterplots for correlations at selected 
voxels are displayed to demonstrate that the correlations are not driven by outliers. Shown 
above each scatterplot are the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and associated p-value. 
The rCBF Z-score values in the scatterplots are adjusted for age, sex, and diagnostic group. 
Abbreviation: rCBF = regional Cerebral Blood Flow.
