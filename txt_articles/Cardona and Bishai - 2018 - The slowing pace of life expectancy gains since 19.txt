The slowing pace of life expectancy gains
since 1950
Carolina Cardona and David Bishai*
Abstract
Background: New technological breakthroughs in biomedicine should have made it easier for countries to
improve life expectancy at birth (LEB). This paper measures the pace of improvement in the decadal gains of LEB,
for the last 60-years adjusting for each country’s starting point of LEB.
Methods: LEB increases over the next 10-years for 139 countries between 1950 and 2009 were regressed on LEB, GDP,
total fertility rate, population density, CO2 emissions, and HIV prevalence using country-specific fixed effects and time-
dummies. Analysis grouped countries into one-of-four strata: LEB < 51, 51 ≤ LEB < 61, 61 ≤ LEB < 71, and LEB ≥ 71.
Results: The rate of increase of LEB has fallen consistently since 1950 across all strata. Results hold in unadjusted
analysis and in the regression-adjusted analysis. LEB decadal gains fell from 4.80 (IQR: 2.98–6.20) years in the 1950s to 2.
39 (IQR:1.80–2.80) years in the 2000s for the healthiest countries (LEB ≥ 71). For countries with the lowest LEB (LEB < 51),
decadal gains fell from 7.38 (IQR:4.83–9.25) years in the 1950s to negative 6.82 (IQR: -12.95–1.05) years in the 2000s.
Multivariate analysis controlling for HIV prevalence, GDP, and other covariates shows a negative effect of time on LEB
decadal gains among all strata.
Conclusions: Contrary to the expectation that advances in health technology and spending would hasten
improvements in LEB, we found that the pace-of-growth of LEB has slowed around the world.

Background
New technological breakthroughs in biomedicine con-
sume an increasing share of the global economy. Tech-
nology ought to enable production to become more
efficient. In the production of population health, one
would expect that the discovery of new vaccines, drugs,
and surgeries would enable more rapid improvement of
population health even if investments in health remained
the same. In the last 60 years with both improved bio-
medical technology and the large increases in health care
spending per capita one would expect to see progress in
the rate at which a country with a low life expectancy of
say 50 or 60 years could achieve improvements.
Multiple factors must work together to improve a
country’s life expectancy at birth (LEB). Economic re-
sources are a necessary, but not sufficient input into bet-
ter population health [1, 2]. Scientific breakthroughs can
help, but the world has abundant examples of poor popu-
lations who fail to access some of the lowest cost public
health interventions like basic sanitation and vector con-
trol. People in lower income countries not only have lower
levels of life expectancy than developed countries, but also
live in poor health a high proportion of their lives [3].
Biological limits to the human lifespan imply that LEB
gains will slow down as populations achieve higher and
higher LEB [4]. Mortality improvements were linked with
better policies that allowed advances in income, salubrity,
education, sanitation and medicine [5]. These gains be-
come harder to achieve as life expectancy becomes higher.
So when the pace of improvement in life expectancy slows
down one has to distinguish the role of ceiling effects
from a slow down due to ineffective policy, misapplication
of health technology or other factors.
The goal of this paper is to measure period effects on
the rate at which life expectancy grows over time. Refer-
ring to the rate of change of LEB over time as “velocity”
(dLEB/dt), we are concerned with asking whether the

 last 60 years have seen acceleration (d2LEB/dt2 > 0) or
deceleration (d2LEB/dt2 < 0). In the 60 year trajectory of
any single country it is trivial to show that there is decel-
eration as life expectancy approaches its upper limits.
The non-trivial question is whether a typical country
with a life expectancy of 50 years in 2010 had better fu-
ture health prospects than a typical country with a life
expectancy of 50 years in 1950. By stratifying countries
according to their starting life expectancy in each period
from 1950 to 2010 we can quantify how much global
changes in living standards and biomedical technology
have made it easier or harder to improve life expectancy.
The objective of this paper is to assess the pace of im-
provement in LEB in the last 60 years within comparable
strata of life expectancy from low LEB (< 51) to high
LEB (≥71). The analysis will try to explain changes in
the pace of life expectancy improvement over time for
each stratum.
Methods
To adjust for a country’s starting point of LEB we di-
vided countries into four strata according to their start-
ing LEB: LEB < 51, 51 ≤ LEB < 61, 61 ≤ LEB < 71, and
LEB ≥ 71. The analysis allowed each country to be re-
classified into a new stratum whenever its life expect-
ancy crossed a specific age cut, threshold. Over the 60-
years most countries left a lower stratum to join a higher
one. Many countries crossed 2–3 life expectancy strata,
contributing country-years of observation in multiple
strata. Table A-2-3 of the Additional file 1 lists countries
by strata using a representative year for each decade,
and Tables A-2-4 through A-2-7 show summary statis-
tics by strata.
Data
We obtained data for a set of 173 countries on life ex-
pectancy at birth and a set of key socioeconomic factors
over a 60-year period, 1950–2009, all from publicly
available databases. LEB data were from the Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [6] for 1970–
2009. Prior to 1970 LEB data were from: Human Mortal-
ity Database (HMD) [7–9], World Population Prospects
(WPP) [10, 11], and Gapminder [12], see Table A-1-1 of
the Additional file 1.
Socioeconomic factors identified in the literature as
contributing
to
life
expectancy
improvement
were:
Population density and GDP per capita, as proxies for
urbanization and economic growth; CO2 emissions, as a
proxy for environmental quality. Total Fertility Rate
(TFR) and HIV prevalence are included because of their
known correlation with population health. Summary sta-
tistics of the total sample of countries are in Table 1,
stratified by decade.
Population Density (per square km) was retrieved from
the United Nations Population Division [13]. Real GDP
per capita is measured at 2005 constant prices, and was
retrieved from Penn World Table of the University of
Pennsylvania [14].
Average CO2 emissions are measured in metric tons
per person, and were retrieved from the Carbon Dioxide
Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) [15]. A country’s
level of carbon dioxide is a proxy of the greenness of an
economy’s production processes. CO2 is included in the
model to control for confounding time trends in air pol-
lution, which has a known negative effect on health.
TFR data for 160 countries were retrieved from the
United Nations Population Division [16]. For the 13
remaining countries data were pulled from different
sources, see Data Sources of the Additional file 1. Esti-
mated HIV prevalence data were obtained from the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)
[17]. The global HIV/AIDS pandemic had a high impact
on the overall number of deaths worldwide. In some low
income countries, an estimated of 1–4 years of life ex-
pectancy are lost due to HIV/AIDS in those older than
5 years [18]. For the years prior to 1970, it was assumed
that HIV prevalence was virtually zero, since the disease
was first acknowledged in 1981 [19]. Some countries
lacked complete data on HIV between 1970 and 1989. For
these countries, country-specific trends after 1990 were
used to back-cast HIV rates into the prior period, see HIV
Imputation – Table A-4-1 of the Additional file 1.
Statistical methods
LEB decadal gains was used as the dependent variable,
defined as the difference between LEBt + 10 and LEBt.
Analysis was performed separately within each LEB
strata to confine comparisons of countries with roughly
equivalent LEB starting points.
For the regression-adjusted analysis, a country fixed
effects model was selected. This model controls for un-
observable time-invariant features of each country [20,
21]. The final model included the following 6 covariates
– motivated by theory, past evidence, and data availabil-
ity: LEB, GDP per capita, population density, CO2 emis-
sions, TFR,
and
HIV
prevalence.
The
model
also
included time dummies for each decade from 1950 -
1959 to 2000–2009.
Each covariate was converted to a Z-score by center-
ing it at its country-specific mean and dividing by its
country-specific standard deviation. Z-scores make it
possible to interpret effect sizes as the impact of a 1 SD
change in a covariate on the decadal change in life ex-
pectancy for countries in each starting LEB stratum.
The equation of the fixed effects model for LEB dec-
ade gain is:

each analysis is stratified to only include country-years
of similar starting life expectancies, we would expect the
benefits of accumulated biomedical technology over time
to make the δ terms get progressively larger such that
δ5>δ4>δ3>δ2>δ1.
The main model includes 139 countries, because HIV
prevalence data were missing for 34 countries. An add-
itional model was specified omitting HIV prevalence, to
ensure the results are not an artifact of a selective sub-
sample, results are on Table A-2-9 of the Additional file
1. This model includes 173 countries, the lists of coun-
tries included in both analysis are provided on Table A-
2-1 and A-2-2 of the Additional file 1.
Results
When we compare countries at a similar starting point
of LEB, we find that the pace of growth of LEB has slo-
wed over the last 60 years for countries at all levels of
starting LEB. Countries with the lowest LEB (LEB < 51)
had the greatest slowdown. Unadjusted results show that
between the 1950s–2000s LEB decadal gains got smaller
by approximately 14 years, from an average decade gain
of 7.38 (SD 3.59) years in 1950–59 to an average decade
loss of 6.82 (SD 6.64) years in 2000–09 (Fig. 1). For
countries in the middle strata see Figure A-3-1 of the
Additional file 1.
Regression-adjusted analysis also reconfirms that LEB
decadal gains became progressively smaller over time
(Table 2). This effect is consistent for countries at all
starting life expectancies, but the effect size is greater for
countries with lower life expectancies, for which the
model explains 55.1% of the variation. In the lowest
group, LEB decadal improvements in the 1960–69
decade were 4.171 (SE 0.473) years lower than in the
1950–59 decade (P < 0.001), and in the 2000–09 decade
were 8.491 (SE 0.982) years lower than in the 1950–59
decade (P < 0.001). The deceleration of LEB growth
among the group with the highest starting LEB was
smaller, at 2.961 (SE 0.181) years gained per decade
slower for the 1960s (P < 0.001) and 1.893 (SE 0.264)
years gained per decade slower for the 2000s (P < 0.001),
both compared to 1950s.
The effects of the factors used to explain improvement
in LEB over time are shown in Table 2. As expected, in-
come per capita had a positive effect. However, it is only
statistically significant for countries with lower starting
life expectancies, (P < 0.05). A 1 SD increase in GDP per
capita is associated with a 0.496 (SE 0.0940) and 0.129
(SE 0.0634) increase in LEB decadal gains in countries
with LEB below 51 and countries with LEB between 51
and 61, respectively.
CO2 emissions had a significant negative effect among
countries with greatest longevity. An increase of 1 SD
(roughly eight tons) in per capita CO2 emissions reduces
LEB decadal gains by 0.169 (SE 0.0295) years. Fertility
had a positive statistically significant effect for countries
of the highest stratum, (P < 0.01). An increase of 1 SD
(roughly 0.8) of TFR is associated with an increase of
0.287 (SE 0.0372) years in LEB decadal gains.
The HIV epidemic reduced LEB decadal gains in all
countries, except those from stratum III. For example, a 1
SD increase in HIV prevalence had a reduction of 0.355
(SE 0.1470) years and 0.082 (SE 0.0400) years in LEB dec-
adal gains among countries of the lowest stratum (P < 0.05)
and highest stratum (P < 0.05), respectively.
When increasing the number of countries to 173 by
omitting HIV prevalence as a control variable, a similar
pattern of decelerating progress in LEB improvement
was observed across all LEB strata, see Table A-2-9 of
the Additional file 1.
Discussion
Even though life expectancy increased year-by-year over
the last 60 years, the gains became progressively smaller

 regardless of whether countries are starting with LEB
below 51 or above 71 or any value in between. The rea-
son for poor performance by the 11 countries with LEB
below 51 in the 2000s cannot be because they were close
to a longevity ceiling. The biological limits of the human
life span cannot be a factor when life expectancy at birth
is less than 51.
There are some important limitations. Many well
known social determinants of health are not available
for most countries back to 1950 and analyzing mortality
at the level of a whole country has the disadvantage of
not allowing any controls for individual level risk factors
and experiences. But national level factors do affect na-
tional level mortality and are the reason population
health indicators like LEB exist. Furthermore, aggrega-
tion of mortality to the level of a whole country allows
fixed effects models to control for the time-invariant
characteristics of a country and permits one to observe
macroeconomic forces that affect the health of whole
populations.

 Our analysis spanned a period that included multiple
scientific breakthroughs spreading new antibiotics, vac-
cines, and surgeries, as well as better treatments for
AIDS, malaria, and TB, around the world. This period
also included a substantial expansion of health care sys-
tems of nearly every country bringing dispensaries,
clinics, and hospitals, as well as financial protection
mechanisms. Thus, it is surprising that the analysis
showed no evidence that time trends in LEB decadal
gains improved over time regardless of starting life
expectancy.
We can think of four potential explanations for this
paradox. First, it is possible that pre-1970 data on life
expectancy from HMD and WPP embody systematic as-
sumptions differing from post-1970 data from IHME.
Second, despite the inclusion of statistical controls for
HIV prevalence, the HIV/AIDS era may have brought
harmful spillover effects putting a brake on health im-
provements. Third, it is possible that the set of low life
expectancy countries in 1950 differs systematically from
the set of low life expectancy countries in 2000. Fourth,
it is possible that the 1950s embodied an approach to
population health different from the approaches used
more recently.
Data
It is possible to be misled by appending demographic
data from different sources. Life expectancy estimates
are inherently based on models, and the underlying age-
specific mortality rates can be extensively modeled by
demographers who are attempting to achieve best esti-
mates consistent with all the evidence at hand. If the
pre-1970 data came from models that overestimated life
expectancy relative to the post-1970 source, our analysis
should have found a step-off point only at 1970.
To assure that declining life expectancy is not simply
the result of appending multiple databases, we repeated
the analysis for 1970 onwards, using only IHME as
source and continued to find statistically significant evi-
dence of a slowdown in the pace of LEB gains, see Table
A-2-8 of the Additional file 1. Thus, the effects are not
solely due to the merging of life expectancy data from
multiple sources.
HIV/aids
It is possible that spillover effects from HIV impeded
progress in improving health, even though our model
controlled for HIV prevalence. It is also possible that
HIV effects spill over to other decades and could have
lagged effects for years into the future. This explanation
is most relevant from 1990 onwards, and among coun-
tries from the lowest strata of starting LEB. From the
1980’s onward there was a slight improvement in HIV
prevalence only among countries with a life expectancy
between 61 and 71, decreasing from 0.86 (SD 2.45) in
the 1980’s to 0.78 (SD 1.99) in the 2000’s. Countries with
lowest LEB (LEB < 51) were the most affected by HIV,
increasing their prevalence from 1.88 (SD 2.39) in the
1980’s to 17.03 (SD 7.83) in the 2000’s.
However, our analysis showed slowdowns in places
and periods where HIV/AIDS was not prevalent enough
to be a plausible explanation of LEB slowing pace. Add-
itional file 1 Table A-2-10 confirms LEB growth deceler-
ation since 1950 across regions where HIV prevalence
was lower than Africa’s. We see evidence of decelerating
rates of LEB growth in East Asia and Pacific, Europe and
Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and
Middle East and North Africa. Furthermore, LEB growth
deceleration was occurring before and during the 1980s
prior to the start of the HIV/AIDS era. Hence HIV may
have contributed to slowing progress in LEB growth, but
it cannot be the sole cause.
Changed mix of countries
Stratification controls for LEB level in each country, and
the fixed effects model can control for idiosyncratic fea-
tures of every single country over time. However, our
methods cannot adjust for unobservable features charac-
terizing the shifting composition of countries within
each grouping over time. For example, in the lowest
group there are 635 country-years of observations on 70
countries (like Mali, Burkina Faso, and India) in the
1950s, and 60 country-years of observations on 11 coun-
tries (like Zimbabwe, Swaziland, and Lesotho) in the
2000s. It is plausible that the former larger set of coun-
tries in the 1950–59 is mainly composed of countries
striving for better health, whereas the latter smaller set
of countries that remain in the lowest group in 2000–09
include a higher proportion of fragile-states [22]. Fragile
states have unique challenges to their health care sys-
tems, not only because of an increased burden of dis-
ease, but also because they have fragile governance and
political conflicts, along with scarcity of health care
workforce, and financial limitations.
While the shifting composition hypothesis is a compel-
ling explanation for the declines in decadal life expect-
ancy gains for the lowest stratum, it is somewhat less
compelling for the highest stratum of life expectancy.
Whereas the set of exceptional 12 countries achieving
life expectancy above 70 by 1950–1959 would be
enriched by high performers, all the 79 countries regis-
tering life expectancy above 70 in 2000–2009 would also
have had to learn to strive to achieve higher life
expectancies.
Explaining a declining pace of life expectancy gains
around the world as reflecting a decline in the eagerness
of societies and governments to improve population
health should provoke critical reflection. Societies have

 shown great enthusiasm for signing declarations like the
Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals. Countries around the world have also
shown a manifest willingness to increase governmental
expenditure on delivering health personal services. They
have had access to the very best policy advice on how to
expand universal health service coverage to guarantee
access to medical care for vulnerable groups. If the de-
clining pace of progress indeed reflects a decline in pol-
itical will among the least healthy countries, then the
policy community is remiss in failing to harness any of
the existing enthusiasm for higher government health
spending into investments that will maintain historical
rates of progress in the growth of life expectancy.
Changed approach to population health
The final explanation is admittedly speculative, and
would hold there has been a fundamental shift since the
mid-twentieth century in the basic approach to improv-
ing population health in every country.
Infectious disease mortality reduced dramatically in
high-income countries between 1880 and 1950, achieved
as a result of what some call the “golden age of public
health” [23, 24]. Improvements in housing, diet, the
safety and quality of water, air, and food mediated by
public health proponents were fundamental to these
early twentieth century gains [25].
In the 1950s countries around the world began to have
access to penicillin and other antibiotics. Following
1950, most countries prioritized efforts to scale-up
health care services supply and life-saving medical treat-
ments and vaccines. Following World War II, former
colonies and less developed countries were challenged to
simultaneously produce an effective public health work-
force while meeting the mandate to introduce life-saving
biomedical services.
In summary, a possible explanation for the slowdown
in health progress is half a century of shifting emphasis
away from covering populations with public health infra-
structure to keep populations healthy and towards deliv-
ering clinical services to cure the sick. Unfortunately, the
ideal evidence to test this conjecture would require data
on each country’s expenditure on non-clinical public
health related activities, and very few countries have this
data [26]. The recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika virus,
and recurrent calls to strengthen public health, reflect a
growing recognition of the unfinished agenda in building
public health infrastructure around the world [27, 28].
Conclusions
The pace of gains in life expectancy has slowed around
the world since 1950, regardless of a country’s starting life
expectancy level. The slowdown preceded the HIV/AIDS
era and extends to regions that have not had high HIV/
AIDS prevalence. Because government health spending
has grown around the world, the slowdown cannot be due
to a slowdown in health spending. Hence, restoring histor-
ical levels of LEB decadal growth is unlikely to be achieved
by further increasing health spending along its current
patterns. The slowdown coincided with an unprecedented
growth in the discovery of life-saving biomedical technolo-
gies, so reversing the slowdown is unlikely to occur
through expanded biomedical research. There are ample
opportunities to restore a policy emphasis on public
health approaches that worked well 60-years ago, when
the world was poorer and sicker.
