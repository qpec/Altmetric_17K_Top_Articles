CONSORT-EHEALTH (V 1.6.1) -
Submission/Publication Form
The CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is intended for authors of randomized trials evaluating web-
based and Internet-based applications/interventions, including mobile interventions, electronic 
games (incl multiplayer games), social media, certain telehealth applications, and other interactive 
and/or networked electronic applications. Some of the items (e.g. all subitems under item 5 - 
description of the intervention) may also be applicable for other study designs.
The goal of the CONSORT EHEALTH checklist and guideline is to be  
a) a guide for reporting for authors of RCTs,  
b) to form a basis for appraisal of an ehealth trial (in terms of validity)
CONSORT-EHEALTH items/subitems are MANDATORY reporting items for studies published in the 
Journal of Medical Internet Research and other journals / scienti䀒c societies endorsing the 
checklist.
Items numbered 1., 2., 3., 4a., 4b etc are original CONSORT or CONSORT-NPT (non-pharmacologic 
treatment) items.  
Items with Roman numerals (i., ii, iii, iv etc.) are CONSORT-EHEALTH extensions/clari䀒cations.
As the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is still considered in a formative stage, we would ask that you 
also RATE ON A SCALE OF 1-5 how important/useful you feel each item is FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
THE CHECKLIST and reporting guideline (optional).
Mandatory reporting items are marked with a red *.  
In the textboxes, either copy & paste the relevant sections from your manuscript into this form - 
please include any quotes from your manuscript in QUOTATION MARKS,  
or answer directly by providing additional information not in the manuscript, or elaborating on why 
the item was not relevant for this study. 
YOUR ANSWERS WILL BE PUBLISHED AS  A SUPPLEMENTARY FILE TO YOUR PUBLICATION IN 
JMIR AND ARE CONSIDERED PART OF YOUR PUBLICATION (IF ACCEPTED).  
Please 䀒ll in these questions diligently. Information will not be copyedited, so please use proper 
spelling and grammar, use correct capitalization, and avoid abbreviations.

1a-i) Identify the mode of delivery in the title
Identify the mode of delivery. Preferably use “web-based” and/or “mobile” and/or “electronic game” in the
title. Avoid ambiguous terms like “online”, “virtual”, “interactive”. Use “Internet-based” only if Intervention
includes non-web-based Internet components (e.g. email), use “computer-based” or “electronic” only if
oǴine products are used. Use “virtual” only in the context of “virtual reality” (3-D worlds). Use “online” only
in the context of “online support groups”. Complement or substitute product names with broader terms for
the class of products (such as “mobile” or “smart phone” instead of “iphone”), especially if the application
runs on different platforms.

Background states: Mobile diabetes applications enable health care 
professionals (HCPs) to monitor patient progress and offer remote 
consultations and allow more effective and informed treatment 
decisions by both patients and HCPs. 
Methods state: Real time app data was automatically uploaded via the 
Cloud from the subjects’ phone to a web version of OTR accessible by 
site HCPs on their office computer. To enable HCPs to easily manage, 
create and send texts across multiple subjects, a text messaging 
program (TextLocal, Chester, UK) was installed on each HCP computer. 
HCPs reviewed the 14 day OTR progress report for each intervention

We state subjects were "randomly assigned to OTVF alone (active 
control) or OTVF with the OTRM APP app (intervention). The intervention 
group also received diabetes­related text messages every 2 weeks from

application offering insights on patient data

1b-iii) Open vs. closed, web-based (self-assessment) vs. face-to-face assessments in the
METHODS section of the ABSTRACT
Mention how participants were recruited (online vs. oǴine), e.g., from an open access website or from a
clinic or a closed online user group (closed usergroup trial), and clarify if this was a purely web-based trial,
or there were face-to-face components (as part of the intervention or for assessment). Clearly say if
outcomes were self-assessed through questionnaires (as common in web-based trials). Note: In traditional
oǴine trials, an open trial (open-label trial) is a type of clinical trial in which both the researchers and
participants know which treatment is being administered. To avoid confusion, use “blinded” or “unblinded”
to indicated the level of blinding instead of “open”, as “open” in web-based trials usually refers to “open
access” (i.e. participants can self-enrol). (Note: Only report in the abstract what the main paper is reporting.

messages (­1.05%), was significantly greater than in active control

alone or to the intervention group which used OTVF and the OneTouch 
Reveal® mobile app (OTR) app together. The responsible HCP at each

Active control and intervention group subjects had similar baseline 
characteristics, with a mean A1c of 8.9% and mean duration of 
diabetes of about 17 years. Over 70% of subjects (94 of 128) reported 
performing SMBG ≥ 3 times per day. 111 of 128 (9287%) of all subjects 
were on some form of insulin therapy. Nearly all. The majority of 
subjects (117 of 128, 91%) had no diabetes apps on their current 
phone; 122 of 128 (95%) had never used diabetes management 
software; and only 12 of 128 (9%) responded that their HCP had ever 
downloaded SMBG data during consultations."

Report multiple “denominators” and provide de䀒nitions: Report N’s (and effect sizes) “across a range of

used more than y weeks, N participants “used” the intervention/comparator at speci䀒c pre-de䀒ned time

"These reductions in A1c in the intervention group after 12 and 24 weeks 
were greater by 0.22% and 0.12%, respectively, compared to reductions in

17a-i) Presentation of process outcomes such as metrics of use and intensity of use
In addition to primary/secondary (clinical) outcomes, the presentation of process outcomes such as
metrics of use and intensity of use (dose, exposure) and their operational de䀒nitions is critical. This does
not only refer to metrics of attrition (13-b) (often a binary variable), but also to more continuous exposure
metrics such as “average session length”. These must be accompanied by a technical description how a
metric like a “session” is de䀒ned (e.g., timeout after idle time) [1] (report under item 6a).
