Antidepressant Use During Pregnancy
and the Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children
Takoua Boukhris, MSc; Odile Sheehy, MSc; Laurent Mottron, MD, PhD; Anick Bérard, PhD
IMPORTANCE The association between the use of antidepressants during gestation and the
risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children is still controversial. The etiology of ASD
remains unclear, although studies have implicated genetic predispositions, environmental
risk factors, and maternal depression.
OBJECTIVE To examine the risk of ASD in children associated with antidepressant use during
pregnancy according to trimester of exposure and taking into account maternal depression.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a register-based study of an ongoing
population-based cohort, the Québec Pregnancy/Children Cohort, which includes data on
all pregnancies and children in Québec from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2009. A total
of 145 456 singleton full-term infants born alive and whose mothers were covered by the
Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec drug plan for at least 12 months before and during
pregnancy were included. Data analysis was conducted from October 1, 2014, to June 30,
2015.
EXPOSURES Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy was defined according to trimester
and specific antidepressant classes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Children with ASD were defined as those with at least
1 diagnosis of ASD between date of birth and last date of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs.
RESULTS During 904 035.50 person-years of follow-up, 1054 children (0.7%) were
diagnosed with ASD; boys with ASD outnumbered girls by a ratio of about 4:1. The mean (SD)
age of children at the end of follow-up was 6.24 (3.19) years. Adjusting for potential
confounders, use of antidepressants during the second and/or third trimester was associated
with the risk of ASD (31 exposed infants; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.15-3.04). Use of
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during the second and/or third trimester was
significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD (22 exposed infants; adjusted hazard
ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.20-3.93). The risk was persistent even after taking into account maternal
history of depression (29 exposed infants; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03-2.97).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of antidepressants, specifically selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, during the second and/or third trimester increases the risk of ASD in
children, even after considering maternal depression. Further research is needed to
specifically assess the risk of ASD associated with antidepressant types and dosages during
pregnancy.

A
ntidepressants (ADs) are widely used during gestation
forthetreatmentofdepression.IntheUnitedStates,the
prevalence of AD use during pregnancy increased from
5.7% in 1999 to 13.3% in 20031; in Canada, 4.5% of pregnant
women reported using ADs between 2001 and 2006.2 How-
ever,thereiscontinuedconfusionregardingtheappropriateuse
of ADs during this critical period. Gestational exposure to ADs
has been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous
abortion,3 major congenital malformations,4 prematurity,5,6
low birth weight,5,6 neonatal withdrawal,7 and pregnancy-
induced hypertension.8 Discontinuation of ADs during preg-
nancy in women with severe depression was associated with
relapse in some studies.9 Nevertheless, up to 20% of women
whocontinuetouseADsduringpregnancyremaindepressed,10
suggesting a lack of efficacy in some pregnant women.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental
syndrome detected in early childhood and characterized by al-
terationsincommunication,language,andsocialinteractionand
byparticularpatternsofinterestsandbehaviors.11Theestimated
prevalenceofASDhasincreasedfrom0.04%in1966toapproxi-
mately1%today12intheUnitedStates.Althoughthisincreaseis

tection, and the recoding of intellectual disability in ASD,13 en-

bothgeneticandenvironmentalfactorsareprobablyinvolved,16
and several risk factors, such as particular genetic variants,17
de novo mutations,18 maternal disease,19 and maternal history
of psychiatric disorders,20 already have been linked with ASD.
Few studies have investigated the effect of AD use during
pregnancy on the risk of ASD in children.21-24 Although some
investigators have found an increased risk of ASD with antena-
tal AD use,22,24 others have suggested there is no statistically
significant association.21,23 However, studies thus far have po-
tential limitations, such as lack of adequate adjustment for ma-
ternalpsychiatricillnessesandgeneticpredispositionsforASD.
In addition, to our knowledge, no study had sufficient power
to investigate the risk of ASD for each class of ADs. Given pro-
jectionsthatdepressionwillbethesecondleadingcauseofdeath
by 2020,25 ADs are likely to remain widely used, including dur-
ing pregnancy. Therefore, a better understanding of the long-
termneurodevelopmentaleffectsofADsonchildrenwhenused
during gestation is a public health priority. We used province-
wide administrative, hospital, and clinical registers in Québec
to investigate the association between AD use during preg-
nancy and the risk of ASD, taking into account classes of ADs,
trimester of use, and maternal psychiatric conditions.
Methods
Cohort
We conducted a register-based cohort study using data from
an ongoing population-based cohort, the Québec Pregnancy/
Children Cohort (QPC). All pregnancies that occurred between
January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2009, in the province of
Québec(186 165women)wereprospectivelyrecordedintheQPC.
Information about individual pregnancies was obtained from
province-widedatabasesandlinkedusinguniquepersonaliden-
tifiers.TheQPCwasfirstconstructedbyidentifyingallpregnan-
ciesintheRégiedel’

tabases.Thefirstdayofthelastmenstrualperiod(firstdayofges-
tation)wasdefinedusingdataongestationalage,whichwasvali-
datedfrompatientrecordsandresultsofultrasonography.26Data
on prospective follow-up were available from 1 year before the
firstdayofgestation,duringpregnancy,anduntilDecember31,
2009, for mothers and their children. The data sources for this
studyincludedthemedicalservicedatabase(RAMQ:diagnoses,
medical procedures, prescribers, and socioeconomic status of
womenandchildren),thePublicPrescriptionDrugInsuranceda-
tabaseofQuébec(drugname,startdate,dose,andduration),the

cedures), and the Québec Statistics database (patient sociode-
mographicdataandbirthweight).Thedatasourcesusedandthe
QPC are described by Bérard and Sheehy.27 This research proj-
ect was approved by the Sainte-Justine’

Participantdataweredeidentified.Dataanalysiswasconducted
from October 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015.
All full-term (≥37 weeks’gestation) singleton infants born
between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2009, and whose
mothers were covered by the RAMQ drug plan for at least 12
months before and during pregnancy were included in this
study.Onlyfull-terminfantswereconsideredbecausethecriti-

defined as the date of entry in the study cohort.
Exposure
We defined AD exposure as having at least 1 prescription filled
at any time during pregnancy or a prescription filled before

pregnancy that overlapped the first day of gestation. Data on
prescription filling for AD were validated against medical rec-
ords and maternal reports,28 with the timing of exposure de-
fined by the date the prescription was filled and duration of
therapy. Exposure to ADs was defined according to trimester
of use (≥14 weeks’gestation, first trimester; 15-26 weeks’ges-
tation, second trimester; and ≥27 weeks’gestation, third tri-
mester). The exposure time window of interest for ASD was
the second and/or third trimester.
The following AD classes were considered: selective sero-
toninreuptakeinhibitors(SSRIs),tricyclicADs,monoamineoxi-
dase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibi-
tors, and other ADs (eTable in the Supplement). Exposure to
a single class was defined as the filling of prescriptions for only
1 AD class in the time window of interest. Use of combined AD
classes was defined as the filling of prescriptions for 2 or more
differentADclasses.Thereferencecategoryforallanalyseswas
infants who were not exposed in utero to ADs.
Outcome and Follow-up
WeidentifiedallchildrenwithadiagnosisofASDbetweenbirth
and the end of follow-up. Autism spectrum disorder was de-
fined as a medical service claim or hospitalization with a di-
agnosis of ASD (childhood autism [International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 299.0 or ICD-10
code F84.0], atypical autism [ICD-9 code 299.0 or ICD-10 code
F84.1], Asperger syndrome [ICD-9 code 299.8 or ICD-10 code
F84.5], other pervasive developmental disorders [ICD-9 code
299.8orICD-10codeF84.8],andpervasivedevelopmentaldis-
ordersnototherwisespecified[ICD-9code299.9orICD-10code
F84.9]). Follow-up of children continued from birth until the
date of the event (index date: ASD), death (censoring), or the
endofthestudyperiod(December31,2009;censoring),which-
ever occurred first.
Covariates
Four categories of variables, including maternal sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, history of maternal psychiatric and
chronicphysicalconditions,andinfantcharacteristics,werecon-
sidered as potential confounding variables and collected in the
database. Maternal sociodemographic characteristics in-
cluded age at conception (<18, 18-24, 25-34, or ≥35 years), liv-
ing alone (yes or no), receipt of social assistance during preg-
nancy (yes or no), and educational level of 12 years or more (yes
or no). Infant characteristics at cohort entry included sex and
yearofbirthtocontrolforpotentialdetectionbias.Sinceinutero
exposuretoADshasbeenshowntobeassociatedwithlowbirth
weight and prematurity29 and thus is potentially in the causal
pathway between gestational use of ADs and the risk of ASD,
infant weight and duration of pregnancy were not used as co-
variates.Historyofmaternalpsychiatricconditionsincludedaf-
fective disorders, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disor-
der (yes or no), and other psychiatric disorders (yes or no).
Historyofmaternalchronicphysicalconditionsincludedchronic
diabetesmellitusorgestationaldiabetes(yesorno)andchronic
or gestational hypertension (yes or no). Psychiatric conditions,
diabetes, and hypertension were identified using diagnosis
codes from medical services and hospitalization in the 1 year
beforeandduringpregnancy(seeeAppendixintheSupplement
for diagnostic codes). The data on filled prescriptions of re-
latedmedications1yearbeforeandduringpregnancywerealso
used to assess other psychiatric conditions, diabetes, and
hypertension (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We first performed descriptive analyses to present the char-
acteristics of the study population, using t tests for continu-
ous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. Crude and
adjustedhazardratios(HRs)with95%CIswerecalculatedusing
Cox proportional hazards regression models. The propor-
tional hazard assumption was evaluated for all variables in-
cluded in the adjusted model by comparing estimated log-
minus-log survival curves. We used multivariable models to
adjust HRs for all potential confounding variables listed above,
including other maternal psychiatric conditions besides affec-
tivedisorders(depression,anxiety,orbipolardisorder).Weper-
formedadjustedKaplan-Meiersurvivalcurvesaccordingtosta-
tus of AD exposure, initially combining all ADs together and
secondly using each class of AD separately.
We further conducted a restricted analysis in women with
a history of depression using Cox proportional hazard regres-
sion models. Finally, we tested the robustness of our results
byconductingsensitivityanalysesinwhichwerestrictedanaly-
ses to infants with a diagnosis of ASD confirmed by a psychia-
trist or a neurologist. All analyses were performed with SAS,
version 9.3, software (SAS Institute Inc).
Differences were considered statistically significant if
the 95% CIs did not overlap 1.0 and at P < .05 (2-tailed). No
statistical adjustment was made for multiple testing.
Results
We identified 145 456 full-term singleton infants born alive,
representing 904 035.50 person-years. These infants consti-
tuted the study cohort (Figure 1), 1054 (0.72%) of whom had
at least 1 diagnosis of ASD. The mean (SD) age at first ASD di-
agnosis was 4.6 (2.2) years (median, 4.0 years), and the mean
age of children at the end of follow-up was 6.2 (3.2) years (me-
dian, 7.0 years). Boys with ASD outnumbered girls by a ratio
of about 4:1. Baseline characteristics of the study population
are shown in Table 1. Women who used ADs during preg-
nancy had a higher frequency of psychiatric disorders and co-
morbidities than women who did not use ADs (Table 1); those
using ADs were older and more likely to have had another child
with ASD than those not using ADs.
Antenatal Exposure to ADs and the Risk of ASD
We identified 4724 infants (3.2%) who were exposed to ADs
in utero; 4200 (88.9%) were exposed during the first trimes-
ter and 2532 (53.6%) were exposed during the second and/or
third trimester. Thirty-one infants (1.2%) exposed to ADs dur-
ing the second and/or third trimester and 40 (1.0%) exposed
during the first trimester were diagnosed with ASD (Figure 1).
After adjustment for all potential confounders, use of ADs
during the second and/or third trimester was statistically as-

sociated with an increased risk of ASD (31 exposed infants; ad-
justed HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.15-3.04) (Table 2 and Figure 2). Use
of ADs in the first trimester or the year before pregnancy was
not associated with the risk of ASD (Table 2).
AD Classes
Use of SSRIs during the second and/or third trimester was sta-
tistically significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD
(22 exposed infants; adjusted HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.20-3.93), as
was use of more than 1 class of AD during the second and/or
third trimester (5 exposed infants; adjusted HR, 4.39; 95% CI,
1.44-13.32) (Table 3). Other classes of ADs were not statisti-
cally significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD
(Table 3).
Assessment of Confounding by History
of Maternal Depression
As a secondary analysis, we restricted our sample to children
of mothers with a history of depression. Adjusting for the same
potential confounders as above, use of ADs during the sec-
ond and/or third trimester was also associated with an in-
creased risk of ASD compared with those who did not use ADs
(29 exposed infants; adjusted HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03-2.97).
Sensitivity Analysis
We conducted the same analyses restricting the study popu-
lation to children with ASD diagnoses confirmed by a psy-
chiatrist or neurologist. We observed an increased risk of
ASD associated with maternal use of ADs during the second
and/or third trimester, but this risk was not statistically sig-
nificant since the number of children with an ASD diagnosis
was reduced by this restriction (adjusted HR, 1.65; 95% CI,
0.98-2.22).
Discussion
Inthislargepopulation-basedstudyof145 456children,weas-
sessedtheassociationbetweenmaternaluseofADsduringpreg-
nancy and the risk of ASD in children, considering timing of ex-
posure, different AD classes, and the indication for use of ADs.
ThisstudyshowsthatuseofADsduringthesecondand/orthird
trimester is associated with an 87% increased risk of ASD, even
after taking into account potential confounders; no associa-
tion was observed between use of ADs during the first trimes-
ter and the risk of ASD. This increased risk was observed with
the use of SSRIs only, as well as the use of more than 1 class of
AD, during the second and/or third trimester. We further found
that prenatal exposure to ADs during the second and/or third
trimester was associated with an increased risk of ASD in chil-
dren whose mothers have a history of depression.
Other studies have explored the association between use
of ADs during pregnancy and the risk of ASD.21-24,30 Taken to-
gether, these studies are suggestive of an increased risk of ASD
associated with use of ADs during pregnancy. Our results on
the maternal use of ADs, and of SSRIs specifically, are in

accordance with others. The prevalence of ASD (0.7%) in our
study is consistent with the prevalence (approximately 60-
110 of 10 000) published in the past 15 years.31 The preva-
lence of boys with ASD in our study was higher than for girls,
which again was consistent with the ratio reported in earlier
epidemiologic studies.32 Maternal age also increased the risk
of ASD, as was observed in other studies.22,24
Several mechanisms may account for the increased risk of
ASD associated with maternal use of ADs during pregnancy.
Selectiveserotoninreuptakeinhibitorscrosstheplacenta33and
are found in amniotic fluid.34 Serotonin can modulate numer-
ous prenatal and postnatal developmental processes, includ-
ing cell division, neuronal migration, cell differentiation, and
synaptogenesis.35 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors act
by blocking the serotonin transporter, which promotes the ac-
cumulation of serotonin in extracellular space. Furthermore,
there is evidence that individuals with ASD have high levels
of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in blood platelets,36
termed hyperserotonemia. The capacity of the brain to syn-
thesize serotonin develops atypically in children with ASD,37
and serotonin receptor 2A binding is altered in the cerebral
cortex of these individuals.38
Strengths of our study include the use of a well-
established cohort of pregnant women with up to 11 years of
follow-up,givingtheadvantageofalargesamplesize.Usingthe
population-based QPC, we were able to obtain accurate infor-
mation on filled medications, without reliance on maternal re-
call,foralargenumberofbirthsandmothers.Thisdatabasealso
providedaccurateinformationabouttheclassesofADsused.28
Furthermore, the length of gestation was validated by ultraso-
nography to determine the exact timing of in utero exposure to
ADs. Physician reports were also prospectively collected, re-
ducing the potential for detection bias, as was observed by the
lack of association between calendar year of birth and the risk
of ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study to ex-
amine the association between maternal use of ADs and risk of
ASD in children according to trimester that takes into account
maternal depression, other maternal mental disorders, and
comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension.
Limitations of this study include the use of prescription
filling data, which may not reflect actual use. However, pre-
scription filling patterns are the most accurate data source for
estimating actual medication intake in large populations.39

all drugs dispensed to pregnant women are actually taken. The
QPC contained no information on maternal lifestyle, such as
smoking or body mass index, which may be potential con-
founders. Although the association between maternal smok-
ing and body mass index and the risk of ASD is debated, we
cannotcompletelyruleoutresidualconfounding.Althoughthe
diagnoses of ASD in the QPC were not validated, we con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis on children with a diagnosis of
ASD confirmed by neurologists and psychiatrists. The find-
ings of this analysis were consistent with those of the main
analyses, increasing the validity of our results. Although our
sample size is large, the size decreased substantially in strati-
fied analysis on family history of ASD, which led to decreased
statistical power. No adjustment was made for multiple com-
parisons; hence, we cannot rule out chance findings given the
number of comparisons made. Our cohort comprises predomi-
nantly women and children of lower socioeconomic status
insured by the RAMQ for their medications. Although this
demographic can affect generalizability, it is unlikely to affect
internal validity, as shown by Bérard and Lacasse.41 Given that
our findings on maternal use of ADs and the risk of ASD in chil-
dren are comparable with those of other studies, external
validity is likely.
Conclusions
In this large population-based cohort study, maternal use of
ADs during the second and/or third trimester was associated
with an increased risk of ASD. Children exposed to SSRIs alone
and those exposed to more than 1 class of ADs during the sec-
ond and/or third trimester had the highest risk. The effect was
persistent even after taking into account maternal history of
depression.
