background Intergenerational social mobility is 
hypothesised to be a stressful process that has a 
negative effect on health. By examining the relationship 
between own socioeconomic position, parental 
socioeconomic position and allostatic load (AL) in a 
representative sample of the British population, we test 
this hypothesis.
Methods Our study uses cross-sectional data 
from 9851 adult participants of waves 2 and 3 of 
Understanding Society. The relationship between 
parental occupational class at age 14 years, respondents’ 
social class at the time of the interview and AL is 
explored by means of diagonal reference models, which 
allow us to disentangle the effects of parental social 
class, own social class and the mobility process. The 
AL score comprises the following biomarkers: (1) total 
cholesterol, (2) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (3) 
triglycerides, (4) glycated haemoglobin, (5) C-reactive 
protein, (6) fibrinogen, (7) systolic blood pressure, (8) 
diastolic blood pressure, (9) resting heart rate, (10) body 
mass index and (11) waist circumference.
results AL is particularly high among the stable 
working class and low among the stable upper class. 
On average, current class and origin class exert about 
equal weight on current AL. However, social mobility—
regardless of whether upwards or downwards—is not 
detrimental for AL. Furthermore, we find evidence that 
class of origin may be less important among those 
outside the labour market for reasons other than 
retirement.
Conclusion Both own social class and parental social 
class influence AL to a similar extent. However, we find 
no evidence that mobility trajectories exert any effects, 
good or bad, on AL.
InTroduCTIon
Socioeconomic position (SEP) is a powerful 
predictor of individual health and well-being. Next 
to one’s own position, the SEP of one’s parents has 
separable and independent effects. These effects 
might be thought of in terms of cumulative advan-
tage: the longer an individual spends in a high posi-
tion, the longer the time without the stresses and 
strains associated with low SEP
.1 2 Such life course 
approaches are effective in explaining all-cause 
mortality and mortality related to cardiovascular 
disease3 as well as psychosocial functioning4 and 
self-rated health5 in adulthood.
However, while the socially stratified nature 
of health is well-established, there is a separate 
and unresolved question of whether intergenera-
tional social mobility has an effect on health and 
well-being. To answer this question, social mobility 
must be considered in terms of its constituent 
parts of SEP in childhood (origin), SEP in adult-
hood (destination) and the trajectory of move-
ment between the two. Research has shown that 
those in a lower SEP than their parents do poorly 
on outcomes including depressive symptoms and 
multisystemic dysregulation, and those in a higher 
SEP do well.6 7 However, these studies have gener-
ally not attempted to separate the effect of low SEP 
from the effect of downward mobility. Moreover, 
it has long been hypothesised that upward mobility 
can also be a stressful experience that is disruptive 
to social connections and attachments as individuals 
leave behind the social milieu they grew up in,8 in 
turn having negative health effects.
There is mixed evidence for this dissociative 
thesis, with some studies demonstrating a nega-
tive effect of upward mobility after controlling 
for current position9–11 while others have shown 
that upward mobility is conducive to higher well-
being.6 12 However, others suggest both upward and 
downward mobility are beneficial,13 while some 
suggest that both upward and downward mobility 
have psychological costs10 or that only downward 
mobility is detrimental.14 Furthermore, mobility 
effects may also be asymmetrical. For example, the 
magnitude of losses to mental health of downward 
mobility are greater than the magnitude of the gains 
of upward mobility.6 In contrast, several studies 
find that any effect of mobility itself is absent or 
weak,15 16 or depends on the context.9 17 18
We identify two not mutually exclusive reasons 
for these discrepancies: the first is methodolog-
ical—on which there is more discussion to follow. 
The second is that there is no agreed-upon stan-
dard about how the presence of dissociation should 
be inferred. While Daenekindt14 tackles the issue 
directly with a questionnaire instrument created to 
measure different facets of dissociation, most other 
studies rely on self-reported summary measures of 
mental and physical well-being, such as life satisfac-
tion,9 happiness19 20 or self-rated health21 and inter-
pret a significant effect of mobility parameters as an 
indicator of the presence of dissociation. Next to 
validity concerns about self-reported outcome vari-
ables,22 the problem of adaptation or ‘entrenched 
deprivation’23 may come into play. Qualitative 
research supports this latter point,10 implying that 
self-reported outcomes are subject to a cognitive 
bias. Our main aim in this study is to add to this 
debate by examining an objective indicator of 
well-being.
One framework within which to understand the 
effects of social mobility on health is the conceptual

Life course effects on health
model of allostatis.24 Allostasis is a compensatory physiological 
mechanism that enables adaptation to psychosocial stressors 
to be able to regain physiological balance (homeostatis). The 
repeated activation of the stress response can however lead to a 
multisystem predisease state, characterised by the dysregulation 
of neuroendocrine, metabolic, inflammatory or cardiovascular 
systems. Allostatic load (AL) is thus the ‘wear and tear’ exacted 
on the body over time by efforts to adapt to life experiences. 
AL is strongly correlated with subclinical conditions as well as 
morbidity and mortality and is seen as a useful summary measure 
of overall health.25 Our study explores whether upward and/or 
downward social mobility affects AL. Previous studies of the 
dissociative thesis have focused on preventive healthcare use26 
or self-reported measures of health and well-being.9 19–21 Ours 
is the first to examine the effect of class dissociation on AL, an 
objective indicator of well-being.
Distinguishing the health effect of the actual mobility expe-
rience from the health conditions characteristic of the early life 
SEP and the later-life SEP is not possible with conventional 
regression models and for this reason we make use of diagonal 
reference models (DRM). A secondary aim of our study is to 
understand the relative influences exerted by early life SEP 
and the later-life SEP on AL. Furthermore, we will explore the 
heterogeneity of class origin effects by mobility status. Since class 
is intertwined with labour market status, we also explore hetero-
geneous effects by working status, by age and by sex.

data source and study population
Understanding Society, the UK Household Longitudinal Study 
(UKHLS) is a prospective, nationally representative study, 
which incorporated the earlier British Household Panel Survey 
(BHPS). In waves 2 (2010–2012 for the UKHLS main sample) 
and 3 (2011–2012 for the BHPS), a large share of the study 
participants was sampled for nurse interviews, where physical 
measures, blood samples, and other health-related information 
were collected. The National Research Ethics Service approved 
the collection of biosocial data and informed consent was 
obtained from all participants. We analyse a sample of 9851 
complete cases. Online supplementary file, table A1 presents 
case selection.
Measurements
Social mobility
We measure social mobility based on two indicators: own class 
and parental class. Respondents’ own social class is based on 
current or, if not in the labour market, last occupation. Respon-
dents were asked about their parents’ occupations when respon-
dents were aged 14 years. Occupation was coded according to the 
National Statistics Socioeconomic classification and collapsed to 
three classes: (i) working class, (ii) intermediate classes and (iii) 
salariat. For determining origin class, we rely on fathers’ class 
and use mothers’ class only in case father’s class information 
is missing. As we are interested in destination class effects, we 
exclude young people (aged under 25 years) from the analysis, 
since they are unlikely to have reached occupational maturity.
Allostatic load
Our measure of AL comprises biomarkers that relate to 
secondary and tertiary stress responses. Primary responses such 
as cortisol could not be collected in the study context due to 
measurement difficulties, for example, time-of-day effects. 
Specifically, we make use of 11 biomarkers, categorised into 5 
physiological systems: 1) lipid metabolism (total cholesterol, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (values reversed) and 
triglycerides), 2) glucose metabolism (glycated haemoglobin), 3) 
inflammation (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen), 4) body fat 
deposition (body mass index and waist measurement) and 5) 
cardiovascular (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and resting 
heart rate). Despite wide variation in the operationalisation of 
AL in previous studies,27 our items cover the most frequently 
included measures.
As there is currently no agreement as to how AL should 
comprehensively be measured, we make use of two approaches. 
Our main approach is similar to Vie et al,28 which is based 
on a mean of the biomarker scores. We first z-transform our 
biomarkers, then calculate the mean score of the transformed 
biomarkers, and lastly z-transform that resulting score. For 
robustness checks, we use a different approach where we 
dichotomise the biomarkers once they surpass a clinically 
relevant, high-risk cut-off value (cut-off values reported 
in online supplementary file, table A2, see also Davillas and 
Pudney29). Our main measure captures greater variation as it 
is not reliant on clinical cut-offs, thereby accounting for the 
full range of predisease states, not just the ‘elevated risk zone’. 
In both approaches, indicators are weighted by the number of 
parameters in the physiological system. The two AL measures 
correlate at r=0.74.
Covariates
We account for age (centred around the sample mean of 52.6 
years), sex (0=male, 1=female), ethnicity (0=non-white, 
1=white), 
partnership 
status 
(0=married/partnered, 
1=single/ 
never married, 2=divorced/separated/widowed) and 
labour market status (0=working, 1=retired, 2=not in labour 
market for another reason). Descriptive statistics for the covari-
ates are presented in the online supplementary file, table A3.
statistical analysis
We make use of diagonal reference models (DRM),30–32 for the 
reason that conventional regression models are unable to iden-
tify social mobility effects. Being the difference between class of 
origin and destination, social mobility effects linearly depend on 
both of these parameters, leading to an identification problem. 
DRM has been used in health research before21 33 and recently 
van der Waal et al34 provided an important illustration of its 
value, but often other models are still used.7
DRMs estimate the effects of origin and destination social 
class on AL using a single vector of coefficients for both class 
positions along with weighting parameters representing the rela-
tive importance of the origin and destination classes:
Y=a +  
p×µii + q×µjj + bX
Where a is the model intercept; subscripts i and j represent 
the social position of origin and destination, respectively; µii 
and µjj are both estimates of Y in the diagonal cells; p represents 
the relative importance of the class of origin and q the relative 
importance of the destination class, which is defined as (1–p). X 
is a vector of covariates that can be interpreted like regression 
coefficients. The guiding assumption of DRM is that socially 
immobile individuals represent the most suitable point of refer-
ence, representing the true characteristics of that given class.

resuLTs
Table 1 presents the average AL scores, with row and column 
totals revealing that AL is stratified both by origin class and desti-
nation class. The diagonal of the table reveals a stronger social 
gradient for the socially immobile. The AL for the stably working 
class respondents is more than a quarter (0.27) of a SD higher 
than the average (which is 0.00 due to standardisation), for those 
from the intermediate classes it is around average (−0.06), and 
−0.30 SD lower for the stable salariat. For the socially mobile, 
table 1 shows that AL scores range in size between the scores of 
their counterparts who are stably in their classes of origin and 
destination.
Table 2 presents the results of diagonal reference models. The 
table can be interpreted as follows. The constant denotes average 
AL for an individual with 0 on all covariates, that is, is male, of 
average age, non-white, married and working. The class coef-
ficients indicate the class-specific deviations from the constant. 
The origin weight ranges between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that 
the origin class plays no role for determining current AL and 1 
indicating that it is only the origin (and not the destination) class 
that governs current AL.
The class coefficients in model (1) of table 2 confirm the social 
gradient in AL found in table 1, even after controls. Working 
class respondents fare worse (0.22, 95% 
CI 0.19 to 0.26) than 
those from the intermediate classes (−0.02, −0.06 to 0.02) and 
the salariat (−0.20, −0.24 to −0.17). The origin weight is 0.49 
(0.41 to 0.58), indicating that origin class is roughly as important 
in determining AL as is destination class. The coefficients for the 
control variables reveal that AL is lower among women (−0.21, 
−0.25 to −0.18), increases with age (0.02 0.02 to 0.02) and is 
lower among whites (−0.15, −0.25 to −0.05). Singles have lower 
AL than the married and cohabiting (−0.08, −0.14 to −0.03), 
and the divorced and widowed have higher AL (0.08, 0.03 to 
0.13). The retired have lower AL than those working (−0.11, 
−0.17 to −0.05), and individuals out of the labour market for 
other reasons exhibit higher AL (0.21, 0.14 to 0.28).
Models (2) to (6) investigate how far social mobility is asso-
ciated with AL. Model (2) shows that mobility in any direction 
is not associated with AL (−0.00, −0.04 to 0.04). Models (3) 
and (4) distinguish between upward and downward mobility and 
reveal that coefficients are close to 0 and have CIs that include 
0. Models (5) and (6) further distinguish between long-range 
and short-range mobility, which yield similar results, namely 
no mobility coefficients that reach conventional levels of statis-
tical significance. Both the Akaike Information Criterion and 
Bayesian Information Criterion suggest that the best-fitting 
model is the parsimonious model (1), lending further weight to 
our conclusion that specific trajectories of class mobility provide 
no additional explanatory power after accounting for origin and 
destination position.
The analyses in table 3 further explore the great importance of 
the class of origin for different subgroups in our sample through 
the addition of interaction terms between the origin weight 
parameter and different covariates. Models (1) and (2) show that 
there are no differences in the importance of origin class for AL 
between men and women and for different age groups. Models 
(3) to (5) show that the importance of origin is the same for the 
socially mobile and for the immobile, regardless of whether it is 
upward or downward. Models (6) and (7) reveal a difference in 
the importance of origin weight when it comes to labour market 
status. The AL of those out of the labour market is determined to 
a greater extent by destination (p=0.19=0.53-0.34) than the AL 
of those who are retired or active in the labour market (p=0.53, 
95% 
CI 0.44 to 0.61).
sensitivity analyses
To assess the robustness of our findings, we conducted a number 
of sensitivity analyses, the coding details and tables for which 
are in the online supplementary file. First, we ran the analysis 
with our alternative measure of AL (table A5). Second, we calcu-
lated class using the household dominance approach35 (table 
A7). Third, we stratified our analyses by sex (table A10) and 
age (tables A13, A14). Fourth, we added controls for health 
behaviours (table A11) and educational attainment36 (table A9). 
We also reran analyses excluding the unemployed (table A12). 
Across all of these checks our findings prove robust, although 
we find the AL gradient is steeper for women than for men. 
Furthermore, we examined the effect of mobility based on a 
5-class schema (table A8), showing substantively similar find-
ings. Lastly, we examined the physiological systems separately 
(table A6). All five systems are stratified, although with some 
differences regarding the importance of origin class. For lipid 
metabolism, inflammation and body fat deposition, the origin 
weight is similar to the main analysis. For the cardiovascular 
system (0.26, −0.00 to 0.54) and glucose metabolism (0.39, 
0.23 to 0.55), however, it is markedly lower, yet CIs are wide 
for these indicators.
dIsCussIon
Our study has confirmed that the lowest AL is found among the 
stable salariat and the highest among the stable working class. 
Furthermore, we have shown that, on average, origin class and 
destination class exert equal influence on one’s current AL, thus 
we suggest that the influence of childhood SEP is both substan-
tial and higher than many previous studies have suggested.19 21 37 
However, once accounting for origin and destination position, 
we find that social mobility itself, in terms of the direction or 
distance travelled between childhood and adulthood, has no 
influence on AL. From this, we are able to surmise that the AL 
of an individual who starts out in the working class and ends 
up in the salariat will be equal to an individual who starts out 
in the salariat and ends up in the working class. Furthermore, 
since there is no effect of long-range or short-range mobility 
compared with stable class membership, our findings counter 
Sorokin’s ‘dissociative thesis’, which postulated that social 
mobility—both upwards and downwards—is straining for indi-
viduals, causing ‘mental diseases and nervousness, psychoses and 
neuroses’.8 Instead, our results are compatible with cumulative 
advantage theory.1 4 The more of the life course spent in high 
socioeconomic position, with the material advantage that brings, 
the lower the AL.
Nonetheless, we also find that the weight of origin appears 
to be weaker for those outside the labour market, a pattern for 
which the mechanism is unclear, although it has been noted else-
where that employment status matters more for mental health

Life course effects on health
What is already known on this subject
 
► Socioeconomic position exerts a powerful effect on individual 
health and well-being.
 
► The socioeconomic conditions of childhood and adulthood 
have separable and additive effects.
 
► However, research on the effects of intergenerational social 
mobility has shown mixed and sometimes contradictory 
results.
 
► Studies of the health effects of social mobility so far have 
focused on subjective or self-rated outcomes.
What this study adds
 
► We examine allostatic load, an objective gauge of the ‘wear 
and tear’ that stress exerts on the body, which follows a 
pronounced social gradient.
 
► Lower allostatic load is seen among those experiencing 
socioeconomic advantage during childhood as well as in 
adulthood.
 
► Diagonal reference models allow us to discern the relative 
importance of origin and destination social class for allostatic 
load, as well as independent effects of specific mobility 
trajectories.
 
► We find that, on average, both origin and destination 
socioeconomic position exert about equal influence on 
current allostatic load.
 
► This is a stronger influence of origin than previous studies 
have suggested.
 
► Having accounted for socioeconomic position, however, 
social mobility per se, regardless of direction, has no 
influence on allostatic load.

than SEP
, with the best outcomes seen among those in the work-
force.38 We can speculate that individuals outside of the labour 
market are particularly vulnerable to effects of low income 
and social isolation, thus current social position has elevated 
significance.
Limitations
The length of time spent in both the class of origin and class of 
destination is likely to be important, but we are limited in ways 
to test this hypothesis. We find that the origin effect does not 
vary with age, but this may be an imperfect proxy for length of 
time in class. A second limitation is that with our research design 
we cannot account for AL baselines, or individual processes of 
adaption, or disease and so forth. The ‘toxic stress’ model,39 
for example, postulates that adversity (including poverty) in 
childhood will influence occupational attainment and health 
independently. Addressing unmeasured heterogeneity of this 
sort may well be a fruitful direction for future research. Finally, 
with our summary measure of health we cannot be certain that 
there were no losses due to dissociation but only that they are 
outweighed by benefits of similar size.
Methodological considerations
A consensus is emerging in the literature that the diagonal refer-
ence model is superior to other modelling approaches and results 
based on other approaches are questionable at best.14 17 34 It 
allows for an empirical breakdown of the components of social 
mobility, namely the starting position (origin), the finishing posi-
tion (destination) as well as the particular trajectory of move-
ment between the two. Previous studies have tended to apply an 
imperfect workaround. Examples include, first, including both 
origin and destination in a single model where significant origin 
estimates suggest lingering effects of childhood SEP
. A second 
approach has been to create a series of dummy variables that 
capture mobility trajectories (eg, working class to salariat). This 
approach has illuminated the accentuated advantage of spending 
both childhood and adulthood in a high SEP but has not been 
able to disentangle the relative effects of childhood and adult-
hood positions.
An additional advantage of DRM is that it provides a means 
of explicitly estimating the relative influence of origin and desti-
nation on the outcome. In view of the known strong associa-
tion between current SEP and health outcomes, our finding that 
the effect childhood SEP is just as strong, is both significant and 
consequential.
