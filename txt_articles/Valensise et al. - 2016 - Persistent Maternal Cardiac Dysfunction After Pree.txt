aternal cardiovascular health represents the key point for 
developing an uneventful pregnancy, and its proper func-
tion is important for a normal evolution of pregnancy. Serious 
pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders such as preeclampsia 
might entail severe future effects on women’s health even after 
delivery and influence the long-term quality of life as well as the 
following pregnancy outcomes. A proper maternal cardiovascu-
lar adaptation to the pregnancy plays a key role for preventing 
gestational hypertensive complications, such as preeclampsia.1–5
Preeclampsia affects the 3% to 8% of pregnancies and rep-
resents a cause of increased maternal and perinatal morbid-
ity and mortality.6,7 According to the different onset time, the 
origin and hemodynamics, preeclampsia is classified as early 
(placental mediated, linked to defective trophoblast invasion 
with high incidence of altered uterine artery Doppler, and 
lower body mass index [BMI]) and late (related to higher BMI 
and no alteration of uterine artery Doppler)8 recurring in 15% 
of the following pregnancies.9–11 Former preeclamptics have 
a 7× higher risk of disease recurrence compared with women 
who have had a normal pregnancy.12,13
Patients with a previous preeclampsia show maternal 
cardiac dysfunction, and they are more likely to develop sys-
temic hypertension and to die at an early age from cardio-
vascular disease.14–17 In particular, postpartum follow-up of 
women with a previous preeclampsia showed persistence of 
altered cardiac geometry and left ventricular dysfunction.18,19 
The latest studies in literature highlight the importance of 
assessing maternal cardiac function and structure evaluating 
hemodynamics in terms of total vascular resistance (TVR), 
left ventricular geometric pattern with regard to the presence 
of concentric geometry, and diastolic dysfunction.20–22 It is of 
primary importance to understand how to select and identify 
those women at increased risk for recurrent preeclampsia. 
In a recent study, Scholten et al23 concluded that the risk of 
recurrent preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction in a subse-
quent pregnancy is inversely and linearly related to pregnancy 
plasma volume, and this condition might predispose to abnor-
mal hemodynamic adaptation to pregnancy. In previously 
early preeclamptic women, given the high incidence of post-
partum asymptomatic left ventricular abnormalities, the high

Abstract—The purpose of our study was to assess cardiac function in nonpregnant women with previous early preeclampsia 
before a second pregnancy to highlight the cardiovascular pattern, which may take a risk for recurrent preeclampsia. 
Seventy-five normotensive patients with previous preeclampsia and 147 controls with a previous uneventful pregnancy were 
enrolled in a case-control study and submitted to echocardiographic examination in the nonpregnant state 12 to 18 months 
after the first delivery. All patients included in the study had pregnancy within 24 months from the echocardiographic 
examination and were followed until term. Twenty-two (29%) of the 75 patients developed recurrent preeclampsia. In the 
nonpregnant state, patients with recurrent preeclampsia compared with controls and nonrecurrent preeclampsia had lower 
stroke volume (63±14 mL versus 73±12 mL and 70±11 mL, P<0.05), cardiac output (4.6±1.2 L versus 5.3±0.9 L and 
5.2±1.0 L, P<0.05), higher E/E′ ratio (11.02±3.43 versus 7.34±2.11 versus 9.03±3.43, P<0.05), and higher total vascular 
resistance (1638±261 dyne·s−1·cm−5 versus 1341±270 dyne·s−1·cm−5 and 1383±261 dyne·s−1·cm−5, P<0.05). Left ventricular 
mass index was higher in both recurrent and nonrecurrent preeclampsia compared with controls (30.0±6.3 g/m2.7 and 
30.4±6.8 g/m2.7 versus 24.8±5.0 g/m2.7, P<0.05). Signs of diastolic dysfunction and different left ventricular characteristics 
are present in the nonpregnant state before a second pregnancy with recurrent preeclampsia. Previous preeclamptic patients 
with nonrecurrent preeclampsia show left ventricular structural and functional features intermediate with respect to controls 
and recurrent preeclampsia.  (Hypertension. 2016;67:748-753. DOI: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06674.)

prevalence of hypertension, and the increased cardiovascular 
risk profile,18 a new pregnancy might develop in an impaired 
hemodynamic environment, which may prepare the ground 
for subsequent complications.
The purpose of our study was to assess cardiac function in 
nonpregnant women who have experienced a previous early pre-
eclampsia before a second pregnancy to highlight the cardiovas-
cular pattern, which may take a risk for recurrent preeclampsia.
Methods
Patient Selection
In a 5-year period (2009–2014), a group of 98 normotensive patients 
with a history of previous early preeclampsia in the first pregnancy 
were referred to the outpatient clinic of Tor Vergata University within 
12 to 18 months after the first pregnancy for the cardiological eval-
uation as a routine follow-up, and they were submitted to clinical 
evaluation and maternal echocardiography. In their first pregnancy, 2 
of the 98 early preeclamptic patients developed HELLP (hemolysis, 
elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome and 1 had an intra-
uterine fetal death. Patients delivered in the first pregnancy at a mean 
of 33±2 weeks of gestation, with a mean neonatal weight centile of 
17±10. Exclusion criteria were (1) echocardiography not performed 
12 to 18 months after previous delivery, (2) no pregnancy within 24 
months from echocardiography, (3) tobacco use, (4) maternal heart 
disease, (5) pre-existing maternal chronic medical problems, and (6) 
persistence of elevated blood systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
values (SBP and DBP, respectively; SBP>140 and DBP>90 mm Hg) 
before the next pregnancy.
Patients were then followed from the beginning of the new preg-
nancy until term to verify the fetomaternal outcomes. Patients under-
went 24 weeks echocardiographic evaluation in the absence of any 
sign of preeclampsia to verify the cardiovascular adaptation to the 
second pregnancy.
The criteria of the International Society for the Study of 
Hypertension in Pregnancy were used to define preeclampsia.24 
Preeclampsia was diagnosed if a previously normotensive woman 
had 2 consecutive (4 hours apart) DBP measurements of >90 mm Hg 
after the 20th week of gestation and proteinuria >300 mg in a 24-hour 
urine specimen.
Control Group
In the same period for each previously preeclamptic patients, 2 con-
trols matched for age and BMI were included as controls in the 
study for a total of 208. These patients, whose first normotensive 
uneventful pregnancy was followed by the outpatient clinic of Tor 
Vergata, had to meet the following criteria: (1) they had to be sub-
mitted to maternal echocardiography 12 to 18 months after the first 
pregnancy; (2) they had to become pregnant within 36 months from 
the first pregnancy; and (3) they had to have a second uneventful 
normotensive pregnancy.
Also these women underwent echocardiographic evaluation at 24 
weeks of gestation in their second pregnancy.
Echocardiographic Evaluation
The M-mode, 2-dimensional (2D), and Doppler echocardiographic 
investigation, evaluating TVR, systolic, diastolic, and morphological 
parameters of the left ventricle, was performed in the nonpregnant 
state in between the 2 pregnancies, at least 12 months after the first 
complicated pregnancy and before the second pregnancy.
The M-mode, 2D, and Doppler echocardiographic evaluations 
were performed with the patient in lateral position in harmonic im-
aging with an Aloka A 7 or Philips ie33 Ultrasound machine. Left 
ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters and interven-
tricular septum and posterior wall diastolic thicknesses were detected 
as previously described25–27 according to the recommendation of the 
American Society of Echocardiography.28 Left ventricular mass in 
grams was calculated by the Devereux formula.29
Left Ventricular Geometric Pattern
Left ventricular mass index (LVMi) was then calculated as follows: 
LVMi=left ventricular mass/m2.7, where m was the height of the 
patient in meters.30 Relative wall thickness was calculated as the ratio 
of (interventricular septum diastolic thickness+posterior wall dia-
stolic thickness)/left ventricular end-diastolic diameter.
Systolic Function
Stroke volume (SV) was calculated as the product of aortic valve area 
and the aortic flow-velocity time integral, as previously described.3 
cardiac output (CO) was calculated as the product of SV and heart 
rate derived from electrocardiographic monitoring.
Total Vascular Resistance
At the end of the maternal echocardiographic examination, SBP and 
DBP were measured from the brachial artery with a manual cuff. 
TVR was calculated in dyne·s−1·cm−5 according to the following for-
mula: TVR=(MBP[mm Hg]/CO[L/min]) 80, where MBP was mean 
blood pressure calculated as DBP+(SBP−DBP)/3.
Diastolic Function
Assessment of diastolic function was obtained as previously described 
according to the recommendations of the European Society of echo-
cardiography.31 The following variables were measured: peak flow 
velocity in early diastole (E-wave velocity) and during atrial contrac-
tion (A-wave velocity), deceleration time of the E wave, and isovolu-
metric relaxation time of the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging 
was obtained at the septal wall of the left ventricle, and E/E′ ratio was 
obtained according to the recommendation of the European society 
of echocardiography.31
Outcome
The evolution of gestation was followed until term by an investiga-
tor, blinded as to the results of maternal echocardiography and previ-
ous maternal history of preeclampsia. Patients were retrospectively 
divided in those who had a recurrent preeclampsia and those who did 
not have recurrent preeclampsia.
Statistical Analysis
Patients were classified as nonrecurrent preeclampsia and recur-
rent preeclampsia. Values are expressed as mean±SD. Comparisons 
among groups (controls, recurrent preeclampsia, and nonrecur-
rent preeclampsia) were performed using the 1-way ANOVA with 
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The Mann–Whitney 
U test was used for non-normally distributed data. Intraobserver and 
interobserver variability were tested in previous studies.5,8,20,21
Results
Twenty-three of the 98 patients with previous preeclampsia 
were excluded from the study: 4 developed hypertension 
before the second pregnancy, 16 did not have a pregnancy in 
the next 24 months from the visit, 2 had miscarriage in the 
first trimester, and 1 had fetal chromosomal anomalies. The 
remaining 75 women were then followed until term: 22 devel-
oped early preeclampsia, 1 patient developed fetal growth 
restriction at term with a delivery at 38 weeks of gestation 
and 4 patients developed gestational hypertension with normal 
fetal weight and delivery after 35 weeks. Because the aim of 
the study was to identify patients with a subsequent early pre-
eclampsia, the 47 patients with no complications, the 4 with 
gestational hypertension, and the 1 with fetal growth restric-
tion were included in nonrecurrent preeclampsia group for the 
analysis.
Forty-three of the 208 controls did not have pregnancy 
within 36 months from the visit after pregnancy, 5 had

miscarriage, 2 had chromosomal abnormalities, 3 developed 
gestational hypertension, 8 were lost during the follow-up of 
the second pregnancy, totalling to 61 patients excluded from 
the study. The remaining 147 controls did not have complica-
tions by definition during pregnancy.
Table 1 reports baseline features of studied patients, the 
weeks, and the birth weight centile at delivery. No differences 
were found in age and BMI. Patients with a recurrent pre-
eclampsia had lower birth weight centile and an earlier week 
at delivery.
Table 2 shows the main hemodynamic features of the 
study group at the visit after 12 to 18 months from the pre-
vious pregnancy. SBP and heart rate did not differ in the 3 
groups. Patients with recurrent preeclampsia showed higher 
DBP, and higher TVR compared with controls and patients 
with nonrecurrent preeclampsia. LVMi was higher in both 
recurrent and nonrecurrent early-onset preeclampsia. relative 
wall thickness was higher in recurrent, intermediate in nonre-
current preeclampsia, and lower in controls.
Table 3 shows diastolic function parameters. Diastolic 
function was different in the controls compared with both 
recurrent and nonrecurrent early-onset preeclampsia. In par-
ticular, E/E′ was higher in the recurrent early-onset patient, 
intermediate in nonrecurrent early-onset patients, and lower 
in controls.
Table 4 shows the hemodynamic and left ventricular mor-
phological features of patients and controls at 24 weeks of 
gestation during the second pregnancy. A low CO with high 
TVR characterized recurrent preeclamptic patients when com-
pared with nonrecurrent preeclampsia and controls. Moreover, 
recurrent preeclampsia showed an increased LVMi and rela-
tive wall thickness showing a tendency to a concentric geom-
etry of the left ventricle.
Discussion
This study shows how cardiovascular abnormalities detected 
through echocardiography in a nonpregnant woman with 
a history of early preeclampsia might identify the risk 
for recurrent preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy. 
Doubtless, cardiac function integrity and the adaptive mech-
anisms during pregnancy play a key role for the proper evo-
lution and outcome of gestation. An impaired hemodynamic 
adaptation in a previous pregnancy and the subsequent com-
plications, such as preeclampsia, might imply an increased 
risk profile for the woman and for the fetus during a second 
pregnancy.
Altered cardiovascular adaptation was noted in patients 
going through several disorders of pregnancy, such as fetal 
growth restriction and preeclampsia. This condition is often 
related to an altered process of trophoblast invasion of the 
spiral arteries with a subsequent abnormal placentation. For 
a long time, the detection of abnormal uterine artery Doppler 
waveform (elevated resistance index and notching) during the 
second trimester of pregnancy was considered as a good tool 
for the screening of high-risk pregnancies, although it shows a 
low positive predictive value.32–35
Previous reports highlighted how TVR and CO can 
improve the uteroplacental screening test.20 In our previous 
studies, cardiac functional and structural alterations were 
present in normotensive pregnant women before the early-
onset preeclampsia, and in gestational hypertension before 
the appearance of subsequent complications. In this study, 
we focused on nonpregnant previously early preeclamptic 
women before a second pregnancy to assess the hemody-
namic state and cardiac function possibly involved in a 
subsequent unfavorable outcome in terms of recurrence of 
preeclampsia.
There is growing evidence of an asymptomatic left ven-
tricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular 
hypertrophy, and prehypertension state 1-year postpartum 
in patients with previous early preeclampsia,18,36 and 40% of 
patients with persistent cardiac alterations develop essential 
hypertension within 2 years after early preeclampsia. Estensen 
et al37 demonstrated a higher resistance throughout the arterial 
system persisting over time in women with a previous pre-
eclampsia. Our study is consistent with these data, confirming 
the high cardiovascular risk profile of previously preeclampsia 
patients 12 to 18 months postpartum. In particular, we found 
that patients with recurrent preeclampsia in the nonpregnant 
state show signs of diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and 
high TVR. These cardiovascular features might represent the 
prepregnancy predisposition involved in the genesis of recur-
rent preeclampsia.

 Valensise et al  Cardiac Dysfunction in Recurrent Preeclampsia  751
The role of echocardiography at 24 weeks of gestation20 
was confirmed in this study and may help identifying nor-
motensive asymptomatic patients weeks before the onset of 
complications, through the evaluation of TVR, CO, and the 
geometry of the left ventricle (Table 4). The main character-
istics of patients with recurrent preeclampsia were the low 
CO, and the altered cardiac structure with a hypertrophied 
ventricle at 24 weeks of gestation. High TVR and low CO 
might be considered signs of an underfilled cardiovascular 
system with a pressure overload, although blood pressure 
is within the normal range. The underfilled cardiovascular 
system together with the signs of cardiovascular systolic 
and diastolic dysfunction, dating before pregnancy, might 
cooperate to the development of recurrent preeclampsia. In 
previous studies, TVR was found to be the best indepen-
dent predictor for the identification of subsequent develop-
ment of complications in pregnancy and the best value for 
an adverse outcome is 1400 dyne·s−1·cm−5 with a positive 
predicted value of 77%.20 Cardiac structural alterations 
were also independent predictors. In this study, left ventric-
ular morphological and functional parameters in recurrent 
preeclampsia were found to be different at 24 weeks of ges-
tation with more concentric geometry and hypertrophied 
ventricle, as well as a lower SV and CO, and a higher TVR. 
These data, though, suggest also that cardiac dysfunction 
and cardiovascular maladaptation precedes the appear-
ance of a recurrent preeclampsia months before the second 
pregnancy.
Scholten et al23 have shown that recurrent preeclampsia is 
characterized by an underfilled cardiovascular system in the 
nonpregnant status. The questioning is if this underfilling state 
is also associated to cardiac structural and functional altera-
tions. Our report shows that in recurrent preeclampsia, 12 to 
18 months after the first preeclampsia pregnancy and months 
before a second pregnancy, TVR, left ventricular mass, and 
left ventricular systolic and diastolic function are altered. We 
observed a significantly lower SV, CO, and elevated TVR 
values in recurrent preeclampsia women compared with both 
controls and nonrecurrent preeclampsia women. The other 
important finding relates to left ventricular features with a sig-
nificantly higher mass in both groups of patients with a previ-
ous preeclampsia and higher diastolic dimensions in patients 
with recurrent preeclampsia. We also found a progressive 
impairment of diastolic function in previous preeclampsia 
patients with the worst condition in recurrent preeclampsia 
compared with patients with nonrecurrent preeclampsia (E/E′ 
progressively higher).
Our data are somehow different from those reported by 
Ghossein-Doh et al38 in recurrent preeclampsia because they 
observed lower left ventricular mass in patients with recur-
rent preeclampsia compared with nonrecurrent preeclamp-
sia. These discrepancies might be explained by differences 
in the selected population. In our study, age was higher, 
BMI was lower, and chronic hypertension was excluded. 
Ghossein-Doh et al38 included chronic hypertensive patients. 
In these patients, the pharmacological treatment might have 
affected the results of left ventricular mass and function, as 
well as the pathogenesis of the recurrent preeclampsia; when 
excluding these chronic hypertensive patients the numbers 
become too small to have comparable data with our series. 
The interesting similarities with Ghossein-Doh et al38 is 
the lower SV in our patients with recurrent preeclampsia, 
denoting that there might be a low plasma volume before 
pregnancy. The overall result is that patients developing pre-
eclampsia have TVR, and left ventricular mass higher than 
controls, and parameters of diastolic and systolic function 
different from both controls and nonrecurrent preeclampsia. 
Moreover, patients with nonrecurrent preeclampsia show 
different left ventricular mass and diastolic function param-
eters compared with controls.
Pregnancy is a stress model for the cardiovascular system, 
and the deleterious effect of the first pregnancy in some pre-
disposed patients might persist. In these women, a new preg-
nancy might unmask the abnormal hemodynamic adaptation 
with left ventricular structural alterations leading to recur-
rent preeclampsia. In our series, recurrent and nonrecurrent 
patients had a similar clinical severity of the preeclamptic dis-
ease in the first pregnancy, suggesting that it is not the sever-
ity of the first episode of early preeclampsia to determine the 
response to the second pregnancy.

TVR links together peripheral (blood pressure) and central 
(CO) hemodynamic factors. Its increase is because of both a 
low CO and a high mean blood pressure, probably favored 
by a altered peripheral vascular reactivity. We think that 
the underfilling state present before and during pregnancy, 
described by Ghossein-Doh et al,38 and confirmed by our 
data might play a key role for the abnormal response of the 
cardiovascular system, leading to a second complicated preg-
nancy. Interestingly, in the nonpregnant state nonrecurrent and 
recurrent preeclampsia patients have similar left ventricular 
mass, although they drastically differ for TVR, SV, and CO. 
All these parameters are consistent with the underfilling state 
and the pressure overload present in recurrent preeclampsia 
in the nonpregnant state, and persisting in the second preg-
nancy (Table 4). We think that the personal susceptibility in 
recurrent preeclampsia, probably determined by genetic fac-
tors, influences the further response to the second pregnancy, 
during which the pressure overload probably induces a sig-
nificant increase in the LVMi and relative wall thickness to 
counterbalance the underfilling state. This particular left 
ventricular structural and functional pattern in the recurrent 
preeclampsia before (Tables 2 and 3) and during the second 
pregnancy (Table 4) highlights a possible ineffective attempt 
of the maternal cardiovascular system to overcome the hemo-
dynamic maladaptation, leading to the complication.
Limitation of the Study
The choice of including the 4 patients with gestational hyper-
tension and the patient with intrauterine growth restriction in 
the nonrecurrent preeclampsia group might be considered as 
an arbitrary choice because, as observed for the HYPITAT 
trial,39 induced labor in these patients might have reduced the 
chance to develop further complications, such as preeclamp-
sia. Nevertheless, as there is no certainty that these patients 
would develop preeclampsia, we chose to include them in 
the nonrecurrent group to analyze the outcome recurrent pre-
eclampsia without other complications that might affect the 
importance of the results.
Perspectives
This data confirm the strong relationship between the 
recurrence of preeclampsia and a possible pregestational 
asymptomatic predisposition characterized by a vascular mal-
adaptation, and a cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction, 
as a ground on which a pregnancy could evolve. Therefore, 
the cardiovascular assessment after a severely complicated 
pregnancy might confer the proper level of risk to the future 
pregnancy and give important information to the obstetrician, 
who might be able to identify and manage these patients even 
before the beginning of pregnancy itself.

What Is New?
• Patients with previous preeclampsia with persistent cardiac alterations 
1 year after pregnancy are at risk for recurrent preeclampsia in the sub-
sequent pregnancy.
What Is Relevant?
• There is a strong relationship between the recurrence of gestational hy-
pertensive disorders, such as a new preeclamptic pregnancy and the 
impaired but asymptomatic woman cardiovascular system dysfunction.
Summary
We studied 75 previously preeclamptic patients in the nonpregnant 
state before a second pregnancy. Patients developing recurrent 
preeclampsia in the second pregnancy more often presented with 
systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and hemodynamic features re-
sembling an underfilling state of the cardiovascular system in the 
nonpregnant state.
