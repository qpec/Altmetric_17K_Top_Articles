SUMMARY
The existence of slow-cycling luminal cells in the prostate has been suggested, but their identity and functional properties remain
unknown. Using a bigenic mouse model to earmark, isolate, and characterize the quiescent stem-like cells, we identify a label-retaining
cell (LRC) population in the luminal cell layer as luminal progenitors. Molecular and biological characterizations show that these luminal
LRCs are significantly enriched in the mouse proximal prostate, exhibit relative dormancy, display bipotency in both in vitro and in vivo
assays, and express a stem/progenitor gene signature with resemblance to aggressive prostate cancer. Importantly, these LRCs, compared
with bulk luminal cells, maintain a lower level of androgen receptor (AR) expression and are less androgen dependent and also castration
resistant in vivo. Finally, analysis of phenotypic markers reveals heterogeneity within the luminal progenitor cell pool. Our study estab-
lishes luminal LRCs as progenitors that may serve as a cellular origin for castration-resistant prostate cancer.
INTRODUCTION
The prostatic gland contains basal and luminal epithelial
cells, together with rare neuroendocrine cells. Luminal
cells express cytokeratin (CK) 18 and androgen receptor
(AR) and are androgen dependent, whereas basal cells
express CK5 and stem cell (SC) transcription factor p63
and are androgen independent (Shen and Abate-Shen,
2010). Developmentally, the murine prostate originates
from an ancestral p63+AR� basal SC population (Pignon
et al., 2013). Studies using prostate regeneration assays
demonstrate that multipotent SCs capable of differenti-
ating into all prostatic cell types are localized in the basal
layer (Kwon and Xin, 2014). Therefore, basal cells are
thought to represent the main pool of prostate stem cells
(PSCs) (Wang et al., 2013). However, lineage-tracing studies
indicate that basal cells rarely generate luminal cells during
adult tissue homeostasis but display plasticity under the
inductive influence of embryonic urogenital mesenchyme
(UGM) cells in tissue regeneration assays, acquiring faculta-
tive stem/progenitor cell properties and generating luminal
cells (Choi et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). Consequently,
both cell layers in adult murine prostate are self-sustained
by lineage-restricted stem/progenitor cells (Choi et al.,
2012), although more primitive SCs reside in the basal layer
(Ousset et al., 2012). An in vitro organoid assay recently
identified a small fraction (<1%) of luminal cells function-
ally defined as multipotent luminal progenitors in that
they were able to generate organoids containing both basal
and luminal cells (Karthaus et al., 2014). Beyond homeosta-
sis, several rare luminal progenitor populations have been
reported in regressed mouse prostates, including castra-
tion-resistant NKX3.1-expressing (CARN) (Wang et al.,
2009), SCA-1+ (Kwon et al., 2016), and castration-resistant
BMI1-expressing (CARB) (Yoo et al., 2016) cells. The precise
relationship between these luminal progenitor cell popula-
tions remains unclear.
The prostate has been a model for studying tissue SCs,
because it undergoes atrophy upon castration and regener-
ation upon re-administration of androgen, and this regres-
sion-regeneration cycle can be repeated multiple times.
Somatic SCs are generally dormant and this cardinal
slow-cycling feature is frequently utilized to identify puta-
tive SCs by labels that become diluted as a result of cell
division (Tang, 2012). Studies have shown that label-re-
taining cells (LRCs) in many organs are enriched for SCs
(dos Santos et al., 2013; Foudi et al., 2009; Szotek et al.,
2008; Tsujimura et al., 2002; Tumbar et al., 2004; Wang
et al., 2012). Previously, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was
employed to perform pulse-chase experiments to identify
candidate SCs. In the prostate, a long-term chased BrdU+
cell population, encompassing both basal and luminal
cells, which resides in the proximal region of mouse pros-
tatic ducts and exhibits attributes of epithelial SCs was pro-
posed as PSCs (Tsujimura et al., 2002). Whether these
dormant cells truly represent SCs has not been answered
mainly due to the technical infeasibility of purifying out
live BrdU+ cells for functional studies. More recently,
cell surface markers coupled with fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) have been used to dissect the subsets

 of cells within a bulk population. These assays depend on
known SC markers, and, notably, the majority of widely
used markers (e.g., SCA-1, CD49f) preferentially identify
prostate basal stem-like cells (Lawson et al., 2007; Lukacs
et al., 2010a; Stoyanova et al., 2012; Xin et al., 2005),
leaving the luminal cell compartment under-studied. Line-
age-tracing technology has greatly enhanced our under-
standing of SC development; however, lineage-tracing
studies only suggest that a certain cell population harbors
SCs, but could not pinpoint which precise cell(s) within
the population is SC (Rycaj and Tang, 2015).
In this study, we employed a bigenic mouse model to
identify, isolate, and characterize the stem-like properties
and gene expression profiles of quiescent LRCs from mouse
prostates expressing a tunable H2B-GFP driven by the
promoter of a luminal lineage-preferential gene probasin
(Suraneni et al., 2010). Biological and molecular studies
show that long-term chased luminal LRCs are inherently
resistant to castration and can generate organoids in vitro
and prostatic glands in vivo. Notably, the LRC-derived
organoids and prostatic glands contain both basal and
luminal cells, suggesting the bipotency of LRCs. RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of this rare population
reveals a progenitor-like transcriptome that resembles ther-
apy-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). Analysis of a spectrum
of phenotypic markers previously linked to epithelial cell
stemness reveals heterogeneity in luminal progenitor pop-
ulations. Collectively, our study augments our understand-
ing of prostate luminal progenitors and provides valuable
insights into their potential roles in prostate development
and, possibly, cancer initiation and progression.
RESULTS
Establishing a Bigenic Mouse Model to Label Slow-
Cycling Cells in Prostatic Epithelium
To study the dormant cell population in the luminal cell
compartment, we adopted a Tet-Off system similar to that
described previously (Tumbar et al., 2004) by engineering
a
Pb-tetVP16
transgenic
line
to
express
tetracycline
repressor-VP16 controlled by probasin (Pbsn)-based ARR2Pb
promoter (Zhang et al., 2000; Figure S1A). By crossing
the Pb-tetVP16 mice with the tetracycline-responsive
element-regulated
mCMV/H2B-GFP
reporter
mice
(Tumbar et al., 2004), we generated the bigenic mice,
Pb-tetVP16-GFP, in which GFP expression is ultimately
driven by Pbsn promoter (Figures S1A and S1B). In this
way, without doxycycline (DOX) administration (pulse),
the prostate tissues would be largely GFP+. Upon DOX
administration (chase), the prostate will gradually lose
the GFP signal due to cell division, while infrequently
cycling and dormant cells would retain GFP for an
extended period of time (Figure S1A). Indeed, the whole
prostate or microdissected prostate branches from the
unchased young adult (6 weeks) animals were green, and
GFP intensity dropped accordingly at different intervals
of chase (Figure 1A). These data demonstrate the successful
establishment of a bigenic mouse model to fluorescently
label slow-cycling cells in the prostatic epithelium.
H2B-GFP Primarily Labels Prostate Luminal Cells
We assessed the expression and distribution of GFP+ cells in
the adult prostate glands. Consistent with the reported ac-
tivity of endogenous Pbsn promoter (Zhang et al., 2000),
GFP signal was higher in ventral prostate (VP) and dorsal
and lateral prostate (DLP) than that in anterior prostate
(AP) (Figure 1B). As a marker of differentiation and
androgen action in the mouse prostate, Pbsn is primarily
expressed in the luminal epithelial cells. Double immuno-
fluorescence (IF) staining of CK5 or CK8 and GFP indicated
that, as expected, GFP+ cells were mainly localized to the
luminal compartment in unchased prostates (Figure 1C).
Consistent with the varying gross GFP intensity in different
prostate lobes (Figure 1B), the frequency of GFP+ cells was
much higher in VP (79.4%) and DLP (79.4%) than that in
AP (43.8%) (Figures 1C and S1C; Table S1). We also observed
some GFP+CK5+ double-positive cells (Figure 1C, solid
arrows) and non-epithelial GFP+ cells in the stromal
compartment (Figure S1C), suggesting that the Pbsn pro-
moter is also active in a small subset of basal and stromal
cells, as reported previously (Valdez et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2006). Interestingly, during the course of this work
and consistent with a prior study (Wang et al., 2014a), we
frequently noticed many GFP+ luminal cells in the lumen
(Figure 1C, dashed arrows), implying that luminal cells
have a faster turnover than basal cells (see below).
Kinetics of H2B-GFP LRCs in Basal and Luminal Cell
Layers
To characterize optimal chase time and kinetic changes in
GFP+ cells, we quantified the percentage of GFP+ cells at
different time points after chase according to their lineage
identity (Figures 1C–1E and 2A). We started chasing the
male mice at 6–8 weeks when the prostate is generally
well developed. The initial luminal cell-labeling efficacy
was 79.4%, 79.4%, and 43.8% for VP, DLP, and AP, respec-
tively (Table S1). As expected, upon chase, prostatic cells
gradually lost GFP signal (Figures 2B and S2A). By 9-week
chase, the percentage of GFP+ luminal cells dropped
from �80% to <20% in VP, and by 14-week chase and after,
GFP+ cells were rarely seen (Figures 2C and S2A). After a 12-
week chase, the luminal GFP+ cells remained at 2%–6% in
different lobes (Figure 2C). Consequently, we referred to
the GFP+ cells that persisted for at least a 12-week chase
as LRCs. This time point is in line with studies in other

 organs using similar H2B-GFP mouse models (dos Santos
et al., 2013; Szotek et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012). Our
model also labeled a small subset of CK5+ basal cells, with
2%–8% GFP+ cells in unchased lobes and 1%–3% GFP+ cells
after a 12-week chase (Figure 2D; Table S1). Interestingly,
compared with the relatively flat curve of basal GFP+ cell
kinetics, luminal GFP+ cells decreased much faster as a
function of chase (Figures 2C and 2D). IF analysis revealed
Ki-67+ cells exclusively in luminal layer in all lobes (Fig-
ure 2E). Furthermore, we frequently and exclusively
observed symmetrically dividing GFP+ cells in the luminal
layer (Figure 2F). These observations validated faster prolif-
eration and loss of GFP signal in luminal cells compared
with basal cells. Quantitatively, unchased young adult
bigenic mice displayed a small percentage of prostatic
GFP+ cells that co-expressed the proliferation marker
Ki-67 (4.03%, 0.42%, and 1.80% for AP, VP, and DLP,
respectively); in contrast, after a 12-week chase no GFP+
cells were stained positive for Ki-67 (Figures 2G and S2B),
confirming the quiescence of LRCs.
Luminal LRCs Are Enriched in the Proximal Prostatic
Ducts and Mark Progenitors Capable of Regenerating
Prostate Glands In Vivo
We next performed in vitro and in vivo SC-related assays,
first in bulk GFP+ LRCs. The lineage-negative (Lin�) GFP+
cells freshly purified from the prostates chased for 12 weeks
(Figure S3A) displayed higher capacity to form 2D colonies

 and 3D spheres with larger size (Figures 3A–3C) than
matched GFP� cells. In vivo tissue regeneration assays
demonstrated that both GFP+ and GFP� cells could readily
regenerate prostate glandular structures with secretions in
the lumen (Figure 3D). The origin of the recombinants
was verified by GFP signal and staining (Figures 3D and
S3B). It is worth noting that, after a 12-week chase, the
LRCs were composed of both luminal and basal cells (ratio =
2:1; Table S1). As basal cells represent the main PSC pool, it
is expected that GFP� population, which contained the
majority of both luminal and basal cells, would also effi-
ciently regenerate prostate tissues in vivo. Regardless, our

 data indicate that the long-term chased LRC population
harbors stem/progenitor cells with tissue regeneration abil-
ity in vivo.
To ‘‘zoom in’’ on the biological differences between
luminal and basal LRCs, we purified GFP+ cells from the
two cell compartments using marker staining and FACS
(Valdez et al., 2012) to identify basal (SCA-1+CD49fhi),
luminal (SCA-1�CD49flo), and stromal (SCA-1+CD49f�/lo)
cells (Figure S4A). Since the Pbsn promoter is active in
only a small subset of basal cells (Valdez et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2006), we considered our Pb-tetVP16-GFP
bigenic model non-optimal to characterize basal SCs. In
support, basal LRCs exhibited limited advantages over
basal non-LRCs in SC-related assays, exhibiting slightly
increased
2D
clonal
capacity
and
nearly
equivalent
sphere-forming cell frequency (Figures S4B and S4C),
although GFP+ basal cells did form larger 3D spheres than
GFP� basal cells (Figure S4D). Overall, these results could
be explained by low labeling efficiency in the basal cell
layer and high SC activity of stochastic basal cells. There-
fore, for the remainder of this study we focused on luminal
LRCs.
Since our initial luminal cell-labeling efficacy was �80%
for VP and DLP, we first tested whether luminal progenitor
cell activity was equally distributed between the labeled
and unlabeled (�20%) luminal populations in unchased
adult animals. Both 2D clonal (Figure S4E) and 3D organoid
(Figure S4F) assays revealed similar activities in unchased
luminal (L)-GFP+ and L-GFP� cells, validating the suit-
ability of our model in comparing stem/progenitor cell
activities in chased L-GFP+ and L-GFP� cells. Freshly puri-
fied luminal LRCs from 12-week-chased prostates exhibited
significantly higher clonal and organoid-forming (Figures
4A and 4B) capacities than matched luminal GFP� cells.
Importantly, luminal GFP+ cells formed large hollow orga-
noids, whereas only a limited number of luminal GFP� cells
formed small compact spheres (Figure 4C). Importantly,
luminal LRC-derived organoids had a glandular structure
reminiscent of normal prostate, with p63+ and CK5+ basal
cells mainly residing in the peripheral layer (Figure S4G).
This result is in line with recent findings that only multipo-
tent luminal progenitors can form organoids in vitro
(Karthaus et al., 2014). When we mixed L-GFP+ or L-GFP�
cells (4.5 3 103) with mouse UGM and implanted subcuta-
neously into NOD-SCID-IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice, only L-GFP+
cells generated prostatic glandular structures with overt
secretions in the lumen (Figure 4D), whereas even higher
numbers of luminal GFP� cells (up to 18 3 103) failed to

 give rise to prostatic tissue (not shown). These LRC-regen-
erated glands were normal-appearing with a layer of CK8+
luminal cells lining the lumen and a discontinuous layer
of CK5+ basal cells encapsulating the structure (Figure 4E).
The identity of injected cells and the LRC origin of
recombinants were verified by GFP staining (Figure 4F),
and the level of GFP was still detectable after several rounds
of cell proliferation during prostate regeneration (not
shown). These results together indicate that luminal LRCs
mark luminal progenitors with bilineage differentiation
capacity in vitro and in vivo.
Previous studies using a BrdU label-retention strategy
suggested that putative PSCs (including both basal and
luminal cells) are slow cycling and enriched in the prox-
imal region of the prostate (Tsujimura et al., 2002). We
sought to examine whether our luminal LRCs are also
enriched in the proximal prostate. Each prostate lobe
from mice chased for 10.5 weeks was dissected longitudi-
nally into two portions, representing the distal and
proximal prostatic ducts. IF analysis of GFP and CK8 indi-
cated that the GFP+CK8+ luminal LRCs were significantly
enriched in the proximal prostatic ducts adjacent to the
urethra (Figures 4G and 4H).
Interestingly, when we examined the mRNA and protein
level of PBSN in the pelvic urogenital sinus (UGS) of
newborn and 1-week-old male mice, we observed that the
Pbsn mRNA and PBSN protein were minimally expressed
in newborn (d1) UGS but readily detectable in 1-week-old
UGS (Figures S4H–S4J), suggesting that Pbsn is expressed
early on in urogenital tissues and Pbsn promoter activity
is not necessarily active only in mature fully differentiated
luminal cells. Indeed, we detected GFP+ cells co-expressing
CK8 and relatively high levels of PBSN protein in pelvic
UGS of 1-week-old bigenic mice (Figure S4K). These results
indicate that our LRC labeling system is also suitable in
marking luminal progenitor cells at early developmental
stages.
Luminal LRCs Display a Luminal Progenitor Gene
Expression Signature
We next sought to determine the molecular features of
L-GFP+ progenitors prepared from bigenic mice chased
for 12 weeks. By performing genome-wide RNA-seq anal-
ysis using rRNA-depleted total RNAs (Figure 5A), we
obtained an average of �77 million reads per sample with
an average mapping rate of 93% to the reference mouse
genome (UCSC version mm10; Figure S5A). MA plot indi-
cated appropriate normalization of our RNA-seq data
(Figure S5B). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of
RNA-seq transcriptome revealed exclusive enrichment in
L-GFP+ (over L-GFP�) cells of gene signatures related to
luminal epithelial progenitors and SCs (Figure 5B, plots
1–4). Significantly, a recently reported signature of an
AR-deleted luminal cell population with a stem-like pheno-
type in the mouse prostate (Xie et al., 2017) was signifi-
cantly enriched in our luminal LRCs (Figure 5B, plot 5).
Furthermore, we recently developed an in vitro 2D culture
system that allows enrichment of luminal progenitors
from primary human prostate tissues (Zhang et al., 2017).
The gene signature of this cultured-enriched human
luminal progenitors (WIT-L) was also enriched in luminal
LRCs (Figure 5B, plot 3). In contrast, and, as expected, sig-
natures associated with non-progenitor cells (luminal
progenitor_down), AR signaling and steroid/androgen
hormone metabolism were only enriched in L-GFP� cells
(Figure S5C). It has been suggested that luminal progeni-
tors are less dependent on AR signaling (Agarwal et al.,
2015; Kwon et al., 2014). Consistent with an enrichment
of AR/androgen signaling in L-GFP� cells (Figure S5C)
and with AR� luminal cell signature (Xie et al., 2017) in
L-GFP+ cells (Figure 5B, plot 5), Ar mRNA expression was
decreased in L-GFP+ cells (Figure 5C). IF analysis of GFP
and AR using titrated anti-AR antibody dilutions revealed
significant heterogeneity of AR expression within luminal
cell population and indicated that �37% ± 1.6% of GFP+
luminal cells expressed low AR protein (Figures 5D and
S5D). Interestingly, CK19, a marker for luminal transit
amplifying cells (Hudson et al., 2001; Korsten et al., 2009;
Wang et al., 2001), and CD24a, a cell surface marker
frequently used to enrich mammary luminal progenitors
(dos Santos et al., 2013; Rodilla et al., 2015), were dramati-
cally increased in L-GFP+ cells (Figure 5C). Intriguingly, we
observed higher levels of Pbsn in L-GFP+ versus L-GFP� cells
(Figure 5C), perhaps indicative of the luminal nature of
LRCs and also due to LRC identification by virtue of Pbsn
promoter
activities. Real-time

confirmed
slightly reduced Ar mRNA levels in L-GFP+ cells and also
validated the differentially expressed patterns of about a
dozen genes in L-GFP+ versus L-GFP� cells (Figure S5E;
data not shown). Intriguingly, L-GFP+ cells, compared
with L-GFP� cells, expressed higher levels of luminal
markers (Nkx3.1, Krt8, and Krt18) but lower levels of basal
genes (Trp63 and Krt5) (Figure S5E).
To further dissect the transcriptomic profiles in L-GFP+
cells (Table S2), we performed the pathway/network
enrichment analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and
DAVID gene ontology annotation. The two approaches
generated similar results and revealed neurogenesis, SC
and development, inflammation/immunity, and cell adhe-
sion being the top gene categories overrepresented in
L-GFP+ cells (Figures 5E and S5F). Interestingly, we have
recently shown that normal human prostate basal/SCs
(Zhang et al., 2016b) and PSA�/lo prostate cancer SCs
(Qin et al., 2012) also preferentially express many neuro-
genesis-related genes. Further GSEA corroborated that,
234

 compared with L-GFP� cells, the slow-cycling L-GFP+ cells
were highly enriched in gene networks involved in
neural/neuronal development and functions (Figures 5B,
plot 6, and S5G). Surprisingly, we observed no obvious
enrichment of cell-cycle-related pathways in L-GFP+ cells,
and a survey of key cell-cycle regulators revealed a generally

 decreased expression of positive cell-cycle genes, while
cell-cycle-negative regulators remained unchanged (Fig-
ure S5H). These results implicate potential involvement
of other mechanisms (e.g., transforming growth factor
b signaling [Salm et al., 2005]) in driving the quiescence
of LRCs.
Neurogenesis and Inflammation Gene Signatures Link
the Gene Expression Profile in Luminal LRCs to
Aggressive and Castration-Resistant PCa
Our recent studies (Zhang et al., 2017) linked the gene
expression profile in WIT-L human prostate luminal
progenitors to aggressive subtypes of PCa such as CRPC
(castration-resistant
PCa)
and
neuroendocrine
PCa.
Further, attenuated AR activity and androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) promote a stem-like cell phenotype in PCa
(Schroeder et al., 2014) and inflammation has been shown
to expand a progenitor-like luminal cell pool (Liu et al.,
2016) and decrease AR signaling in human prostatic
luminal cells (Zhang et al., 2016a). These discussions
prompted us to determine whether the gene expression
profile in luminal LRCs could be linked to clinical features
of PCa. GSEA revealed a significant enrichment of gene sig-
natures of WIT-L human luminal progenitors in L-GFP+
cells (Figure 5B, plot 3), suggesting that the luminal LRC
gene profile may associate with aggressive PCa phenotypes.
In support, gene signatures in patient CRPC after failure of
ADT were enriched in L-GFP+ cells (Figures 5F and S5I).
These latter observations may suggest a global progenitor-
like gene expression profile in human CRPC.
Of interest, a gene signature of mouse prostate tumors
originated from basal cells (Wang et al., 2013) was modestly
but significantly enriched in L-GFP+ cells (Figure S5J), sug-
gesting that prostate tumors with a basal cell origin may be
maintained by luminal progenitor-like cells, consistent
with an earlier study (Stoyanova et al., 2013). Importantly,
a recently reported gene signature of a human CD38low
prostatic luminal progenitor population was dramatically
enriched in our L-GFP+ cells (Figure 5G). Of note, the
CD38low human luminal progenitors are tightly associated
with inflammation in PCa, express an inflammatory signa-
ture with reduced AR and androgen signaling, and asso-
ciate with disease progression and poor outcome (Liu
et al., 2016). Thus, our mouse luminal LRCs share molecu-
lar features with human prostatic luminal progenitors.
Luminal LRCs Resist Castration In Vivo
The cellular origin(s) of castration resistance is a central
question in PCa research and a long-standing hypothesis
is that stem/progenitor cells may preferentially survive
ADT. Consequently, we evaluated the in vivo castration
sensitivity of luminal LRCs. To first assess whether our
model could label luminal cells intrinsically resistant to
castration, we castrated the unchased Pb-tetVP16-GFP
male mice at 6–8 weeks and then started DOX chase and
examined the abundance of GFP+ cells in prostate lobes
at different time points after castration. Numerous GFP+
cells (8.0%, 29.3%, and 20.1% for AP, VP, and DLP, respec-
tively) were observed at even 12 weeks after castration (Fig-
ure S6A), suggesting that our model marks a proportion of
luminal cells that are intrinsically castration resistant in
physiological conditions. We next sought to evaluate
whether long-term chased LRCs resist castration. We
castrated 10- to 12-week-chased bigenic male mice and
analyzed prostates 1–4 weeks later (Figures 6A–6D). As
short as 1 week after castration, seminal vesicles and pros-
tate glands shrank significantly (Figures 6A and 6C), sug-
gesting successful androgen ablation. In all experimental
settings, the frequency of luminal LRCs (GFP+CK8+)
dramatically increased post castration, indicating that
GFP+ cells possessed intrinsic survival advantages over
GFP� cells (Figures 6A–6D). For example, in uncastrated
bigenic mice chased for 14 weeks, very few GFP+ cells
were seen (Figure S2A); in contrast, abundant GFP+ cells
remained in the prostates of mice castrated at 10–12 weeks
and harvested at 13- to 14-week chase (Figures 6B–6D). We
also examined whether LRCs resist apoptosis after castra-
tion by co-IF analysis of GFP and cleaved caspase-3 in the
prostates castrated at 12- to 13-week chase and harvested
at 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks post castration (Figure S6B).
Apoptosis in mouse prostatic luminal cells generally peaks
at 3–4 days after castration and persists, at declining levels,
in the following 1–3 weeks (Kato et al., 2013). Notably, we
did not detect any GFP+ LRC cells expressing cleaved
caspase-3 in all three experimental settings (Figure S6B),
suggesting that castration-induced apoptosis in LRCs is a
rare event. To further determine whether the increased
number of GFP+ LRCs was due to proliferation besides resis-
tance to apoptosis, we performed co-IF of Ki67 and GFP in
the above experimental settings. A small number of Ki67+
epithelial cells were observed in regressed prostates (e.g.,
1-week [Figure S6C] or 2-weeks [Figure S6D] post castra-
tion), but no GFP+ Ki67+ LRCs were found (Figure S6D),
consistent with the dormancy of LRCs. These results collec-
tively
demonstrate
that
luminal
LRCs
preferentially
survive androgen deprivation.
Phenotypic Analysis of LRCs Reveals Heterogeneity in
Luminal Progenitor Cells
Several surface markers have been reported for mouse
mammary
luminal
progenitors,
including
SCA-1
(or
LY6A), CD133, CD117, CD14, CD24 (Shehata et al.,
2012), NOTCH3 (Lafkas et al., 2013), and NOTCH1 (Rodilla
et al., 2015). Other than SCA-1 (Burger et al., 2005), similar
phenotypic studies in the mouse prostate under physiolog-
ical (i.e., homeostatic) conditions are generally lacking.

 CK19 was proposed as a prostate luminal progenitor
marker in several studies (Hudson et al., 2001; Korsten
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2001) and several SC factors
such as BMI1 (Yoo et al., 2016), SOX2 (Kregel et al.,
2013), STAT3 (Schroeder et al., 2014), and HOXB9 (de Pi-
nieux et al., 2001) have been associated with stem-like
prostate (cancer) cells under castration condition. We per-
formed double IF staining of GFP and about a dozen of
reported mouse prostate/mammary luminal progenitor
markers on prostate tissues collected from bigenic mice
chased for 12 weeks and correlated with the marker
mRNA levels in RNA-seq (Figure 7A). Most of these markers
were undetectable in normal uncastrated prostates in both
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded cryosections (Fig-
ure 7A). Consistent with the RNA-seq data (Figures 5C
and 7A), L-GFP+ cells expressed relatively abundant CK19
protein compared with L-GFP� cells, although not all
CK19high cells were GFP+ (Figures 7B and S7A). A subset
of L-GFP+ cells co-expressed SCA-1 at the proximal pros-
tate, and not all SCA-1+ cells were GFP+ (Figure 7B), consis-
tent with a recent report that SCA-1 identifies a distinct
subset of androgen-independent luminal progenitors in
the proximal prostate (Kwon et al., 2016). The 12-week-
chased L-GFP+ cells did not co-localize with BMI1-expres-
ing cells (Figures 7B and S7A), a rare population that mainly
resides in the basal cell layer (Lukacs et al., 2010b),
although Bmi1+ cells have recently been reported to reside,
infrequently, in the luminal layer and mark rare castration-
resistant luminal progenitors (Yoo et al., 2016). We
detected a relatively low and homogeneous expression of
NOTCH1 (Figure 7B), suggesting that, unlike in mammary
tissues (Rodilla et al., 2015), NOTCH1 is not a preferential
marker for prostate luminal progenitors. The positive stain-
ing of BMI1 and SCA-1 in stromal cells, and cleaved
caspase-3 in apoptotic cells shed into the lumen after
castration, served as positive control for IF analysis (Fig-
ure S7B). Together, these data suggest that prostate luminal
progenitors are phenotypically, and, likely, functionally (as
reflected by heterogeneous AR expression), heterogeneous.
DISCUSSION
Recent studies, employing 2D (Zhang et al., 2017) and 3D
organoid (Karthaus et al., 2014) in vitro culture systems for
human prostate and BrdU pulse-chase (Tsujimura et al.,
2002) and lineage-tracing (Choi et al., 2012; Ousset et al.,
2012) techniques for murine prostate, have indicated the
existence of luminal progenitors within the luminal cell
lineage. In this study, we established a bigenic mouse model
to specifically label slow-cycling cells in the prostate epithe-
lium, and further defined luminal LRCs as functional pro-
genitors distinct from bulk luminal cells. These luminal
LRCs have the following features: (1) they are relatively
dormant and, like BrdU-retaining LRCs (Tsujimura et al.,
2002), enriched in the proximal prostate; (2) they display
Figure 6. Luminal LRCs Resist Castration In Vivo
The Pb-tetVP16-GFP bigenic male mice were castrated at 11, 10, 12, and 12 weeks after chase and analyzed 1 week (A), 4 weeks (B), 1 week
(C), and 2 weeks (D) later, respectively. Shown are representative images of urogenital organs and dissected prostate lobes (A), IF of GFP
and CK8 in the VP (B–D) and H&E of AP (D) from bigenic mice with or without castration. Quantification of the percentage of GFP+ cells in

 bipotential differentiation ability in both in vitro organoid
and in vivo prostate regeneration assays; (3) they express a
progenitor gene signature with preferential expression of
neurogenesis- and inflammation-associated genes, and
this gene signature is dramatically enriched in treatment-
failed PCa; (4) they survive androgen ablation by resisting
castration-induced apoptosis and are further enriched in
the prostate of castrated mice; and (5) they are phenotypi-
cally heterogeneous with only a subset expressing previ-
ously reported progenitor markers such as CK19 and SCA-1.
Studying prostatic luminal cells has been challenging
due to their low stemness and the current infeasibility of
efficient culturing in vitro. Prior studies have mainly
employed known SC-related surface markers identified in
other tissues to dissect the epithelial biology of the pros-
tate. Currently, there is no well-accepted definition for
prostate luminal progenitors (Zhang et al., 2017), and
only a few studies have reported putative phenotypic
markers of stem-like luminal cells in humans (i.e., CD38low;
Liu et al., 2016) and in regressed mouse prostates (e.g.,
NKX3.1+ [Wang et al., 2009], SCA-1+ [Kwon et al., 2016],
and BMI1+ [Yoo et al., 2016]). The slow-cycling luminal
progenitor (i.e., L-GFP+) cells, identified here in a marker-
independent manner, only partially overlap with a few of

 previously reported progenitor markers. In fact, most of the
markers we analyzed, including CD117, CD14, CD133,
STAT3, NOTCH3, CD24, HOXB9, and SOX2, seem to be
expressed at too low levels to be reliably detected in the
normal mouse prostate. Nevertheless, luminal LRCs appear
to generally express low NOTCH1 and high CK19 levels,
and a subset of LRCs stains positive for SCA-1. Consistent
with a recent report (Yoo et al., 2016) showing that
BMI1+ luminal cells are rarely seen in normal prostate,
our LRCs do not co-localize with BMI1+ cells. These obser-
vations raise a question of whether the mouse prostate,
under
homeostatic
conditions,
might
have
distinct
luminal progenitor subsets at varying proliferative states,
like the hematopoietic system. For example, our LRCs
mainly isolate slow-cycling luminal progenitor cells, while
the
SCA-1+LRCs�
might
represent
fast-proliferating
luminal progenitors. Regardless, our study, together with
studies from others mentioned above, suggests the pres-
ence of multiple luminal progenitor cell populations in
the unperturbed mouse prostate. Notably, our present
study focuses on normal luminal progenitors; whether
these LRCs change their phenotypic marker profiles and
then overlap with some of the luminal progenitors (e.g.,
CARNs and CARBs) previously reported in regressed pros-
tate remains to be determined.
Significantly, the slow-cycling LRCs, like NKX3.1-ex-
pressing CARNs (Wang et al., 2009), SCA-1+ (Kwon et al.,
2016), and BMI1+ (Yoo et al., 2016) luminal progenitors
in regressed prostates, are intrinsically resistant to castra-
tion, suggesting that the luminal cell layer in normal
prostate harbors subsets of naturally androgen-insensitive
cells that can survive androgen deprivation. Castration
resistance in LRCs could be related to relatively low AR
expression, as �37% LRCs express low levels of AR protein.
Simultaneously or alternatively, castration resistance in
LRCs may also be associated with their relative quiescence.
In this regard, the L-GFP+ cells coordinately underexpress a
cohort of positive cell-cycle regulator genes. Detailed
dissection of LRCs in castrated prostates is needed to reveal
mechanisms of androgen ablation resistance. One poten-
tial solution is to perform single-cell RNA-seq analysis to
reveal cell-to-cell heterogeneity within the luminal cell
compartment under both physiological and castration
conditions.
The study of luminal progenitors in the prostate is of
great significance to both basic and clinical research. First,
luminal cells are the functional units mediating secretory
activities and the luminal cell layer is self-sustaining
(Choi et al., 2012), indicating the importance of progeni-
tors in maintaining prostate homeostasis and glandular
functions (Xie et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016a). Second,
the luminal layer in situ seems to be overall more prolifera-
tive (Wang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016b) and murine
luminal cells are more susceptible to tumorigenic transfor-
mation to generate aggressive tumors (Wang et al., 2014b).
This raises the possibility of luminal progenitors func-
tioning as preferred cells-of-origin for CRPC. Our current
findings that luminal LRCs preferentially survive androgen
ablation provide support to this possibility. Third, stem-like
luminal cells may function as tumor-propagating cells
(Stoyanova et al., 2013), in line with mouse genetic studies
(Abou-Kheir et al., 2010; Korsten et al., 2009) and with pre-
vious report showing that aggressive breast basal-like can-
cers actually originate from luminal progenitors rather
than from basal SCs (Molyneux et al., 2010). Fourth, while
this manuscript was under revision, a study identified a rare
castration-resistant luminal progenitor cell population
with a Lin�/SCA-1+/CD49fmed phenotype highly enriched
in Pten-null prostate tumors (Sackmann Sala et al., 2017).
Finally, the luminal progenitor gene expression profile
can be linked to advanced and aggressive PCa subtypes
(Liu et al., 2016; Sackmann Sala et al., 2017; Zhang et al.,
2017; this study). This notion is further strengthened by
the molecular resemblance of our luminal LRCs to recently
reported human CD38low prostatic luminal progenitors
(Liu et al., 2016), which has been shown to be associated
with
inflammation
and
PCa
progression
with
poor
outcome. In aggregate, our study presents a comprehensive
biological and molecular characterization of slow-cycling
prostate luminal progenitors. Further studies on the func-
tional roles of luminal LRCs in tumorigenesis, and the
molecular mechanisms that regulate their homeostasis
and dormancy, may yield new predictive markers and ther-
apeutic targets for aggressive CRPC.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
