Objective To (1) determine how intended users interact with and
use the BD Odon Device in simulation, (2) use these findings to
alter progressively the design of the BD Odon Device and (3)
validate that these changes have improved the ability of
practitioners to use the BD Odon Device.
Design Human factors evaluation study.
Setting Simulation suite designed to mimic delivery room.
Population or sample Three hundred and ninety simulated
operative births, performed by 100 practising clinicians.
Methods Simulated operative vaginal births performed using the
BD Odon Device and the device Instructions for use were subjected
to three formative human factors evaluations and one human
factors validation test. Following each evaluation, findings were
reviewed and the design of the BD Odon Device and Instructions
for use were modified.
Main outcome measures Successful performance of an operative
vaginal birth using the BD Odon Device in accordance with
provided training and Instructions for use.
Results Using version two of the BD Odon Device, and following
exposure to face-to-face training and written instructions, 25% of
accouchers were able successfully to perform a simulated operative
vaginal birth. In the final evaluation, following device design and
training material alterations, all accouchers were able successfully
to perform a simulated operative vaginal birth using version four
of the BD Odon Device.
Conclusions Human factors evaluations have enabled a multi-
professional device and training materials design team to alter the
design of the BD Odon Device and the Instructions for use in an
evidence-based fashion. This process has resulted in a device
which has a predictable and likely safe pattern of use.
Keywords BD Odon Device, human factors, improvements, use.
Tweetable abstract Human Factors evaluations help make the BD
Odon Device safe and usable for clinical practice.

Introduction
Operative vaginal birth (OVB) is an important skill that
can improve outcomes for mothers and their babies.1
However, performing an operative vaginal delivery is a
complex, time-critical technical skill and the misuse of
forceps or vacuum can lead to significant injury to the
mother and/or her baby.2 Such concerns led to the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA to release a
Public Health Advisory Paper explaining the need for
caution when using vacuum-assisted delivery devices.3
Similar concerns have been expressed about the use of
forceps.4 Although forceps and vacuum are not inherently
dangerous, inappropriate patient selection, level of techni-
cal skill or poor working of the team in using the instru-
ment can all interact and have a significant effect on
their safety.
The introduction into clinical practice of a new medical
device to expedite vaginal birth is complex and requires
detailed investigation: when is the device best used, for

 whom should the device be used, how is the device best
used and how do clinicians train to use the device? The
unique features of the BD Odon Device (BD, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) (e.g. air chamber and sleeve) seem to offer
advantages in clinical practice, but the novelty of the design
means that the technique required for the BD Odon Device
is markedly different from those employed during a forceps
or vacuum-assisted delivery. The components of the BD
Odon Device are shown in Figure 1. Therefore, before it is
introduced into clinical practice it is crucial to ensure that
accoucheurs use the BD Odon Device in a safe and effec-
tive manner. Ideally, the use of the BD Odon Device
should
be
understandable,
intuitive
and
reproducible.
Moreover, the BD Odon Device and Instructions for Use
(IFU) should demonstrate that they can be used by repre-
sentative users without producing patterns of failures that
could result in poor clinical outcomes or harm.
Human factors evaluation (HFE) focuses on the interac-
tions between users and devices and is used to ensure and
demonstrate that medical devices are as safe, reliable and
effective as possible.5 Human factors evaluations are used
to refine and improve the user–device interface. This inter-
face includes all components with which users interact with
the device; preparing the device for use (e.g. unpacking
and set up) and using the device (e.g. how users perceive
and interpret the information from the device, make deci-
sions about what to do, and manipulate the device during
use). Human factors evaluations provide evidence to ensure
that a device does not lead to failures of design and that
the risk controls made by the design team, by altering the
device or the supporting training materials, are effective.
The most important goal of the human factors evaluation
process is to minimise use-related hazards and risks and
thus improve safety.5
This paper describes the human factors evaluations con-
ducted to determine the useability of the BD Odon Device
and describes the iterative modifications to the design of
the device [and associated IFU and training materials] in
response to user feedback.
Methods
Three formative evaluations and one human factors valida-
tion test (HFVT) were conducted. Participants in the for-
mative
evaluations
were
practising
midwives
and
obstetricians from South West England and all testing was
conducted in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK. Participants
in the validation test were recruited from 14 countries (UK,
Ireland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Egypt, Nigeria,
South Africa, Kenya, Jordan, India, Nepal and Australia).
Testing was conducted in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK,
the Assembly Rooms, Bath, UK, and the RCOG Annual
Congress 2017, Cape Town, South Africa. Each participant
performed a series of structured simulations of an operative
vaginal birth using the BD Odon Device to deliver a fetal
mannequin from an anatomicaly accurate maternal man-
nequin (PROMPT Flex�, Limbs and Things Ltd, Bristol,
UK).6 In each simulation the fetal mannequin was placed in
a cephalic presentation, in the occipito-anterior (OA) posi-
tion, with the vertex 2 cm below the ischial spines. To
increase the environmental validity of the simulations, all
assisted births were performed in a setting design to mimic
a delivery room, with the maternal mannequin lying on a
delivery bed or table. All simulations and interviews were
recorded on a stationary video camera (GoPro Hero4 Ses-
sion, GoPro, San Mateo, CA, USA) and observed by an
obstetrician (SO’B), human factors expert (AM), design
engineer (DA, TS or WLL). The inventor of the BD Odon
Device (JO) was present for the majority of simulations.
Participants were provided with a prototype BD Odon
Device and asked to attempt to deliver the fetus using the
device.
Expediting

using
the

requires three distinct stages to be completed by the opera-
tor: (1) preparation of the device, (2) application of the

 device into the correct position around the fetal head and
(3) use of traction to deliver the fetal head. These three
stages, together with the individual steps required in each
stage, are outlined in Table 1.
At the start of formative evaluations one, two and three,
each participant was randomised to one of four groups: (1)
using the device with no IFU or training, (2) using the device
after reading a copy of the current IFU, (3) using the device
after face-to-face training and (4) watching a training video.
During the final validation evaluation, all participants were
exposed to one-to-one training and the IFU before attempt-
ing to use the device. The individual objectives of each study
varied based on the findings of the previous study and subse-
quent design changes made by the study team to the device
and IFU, while the overall objective (to determine how par-
ticipants interacted with the BD Odon Device and IFU, and
to mitigate any patterns of use which would compromise the
safety and efficacy of the device) remained the same.
The ability of participants to perform each phase and
step was recorded after their exposure to different training
materials (IFU, video and one-to-one training). A step was
defined as being successfully completed if it was performed
safely, correctly and in the correct sequence.
Following the simulations, participants were questioned
on the design of the device and their understanding of (1)
the BD Odon Device, (2) the IFU, (3) the face-to-face
training module and (4) training video.
Following each HFE, the multi-professional device devel-
opment
team
comprising
of
obstetricians,
midwives,
human factor specialists and R&D engineers used the study
findings to iteratively modify the device and associated IFU
and training materials to address any user difficulties and/
or risks observed during simulations. These evidence-based
changes were evaluated in the subsequent round of testing
to ensure the previously uncovered user errors had been
mitigated and no new risks or problems had been created.
Versions two, three and four of the BD Odon Device was
used in these evalutions. Version one was an early protoype
and was not assessed.
Simulations and interviews were structured in accor-
dance with human factors evaluation practices and guide-
lines from the FDA and the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).5,7 The study was

ıve participants who had not previously been exposed to
the BD Odon Device participated. The demographics of the
four cohorts are summarised in Table 2.
The percentage of participants able correctly to perform
respectively at least 50% and 75% of the steps required in
each phase (preparation, application and delivery) of the
use of the BD Odon Device are provided in Table 3. These
data are further classified by device version (version two,
three or four) and type of training (no IFU, IFU alone,
IFU and one-to-one training, IFU and video) and the
attempt number.
There was no significant difference between the ability of
midwives and obstetricians to perform an operative vaginal
birth using the BD Odon Device (Table 4).
Formative evaluation one (March 2016)
Thirty-five staff (15 midwives and 20 obstetricians) partici-
pated in the first formative study.
Version two of the BD Odon Device was not intuitive to
use. During this evaluation, only two of the 11 (18%) partici-
pants who were presented with the BD Odon Device and
asked to conduct a simulated OVB (i.e. they did not see the
IFU or receive any training) were able to complete at least
50% of the steps required for preparation. None of the 11
participants were able to apply the device correctly to the
fetal head or deliver the baby. However, when 28 participants
were provided with a copy of the IFU prior to attempting to
conduct an OVB with the BD Odon Device, 25 (89%) were
able to complete at least 50% of the steps required for prepa-
ration. Yet, despite having a copy of the IFU, only eight
(29%) participants were able to complete at least 50% of the
steps required for application of the device and delivery of
the baby. The addition of one-to-one training significantly
increased the ability of participants to correctly use version
two of the BD Odon Device (Table 3).
In response to observation of the device in use and par-
ticipant feedback during the first formative evaluation,
modifications were made to the design of the associated
IFU and training materials (Table 5). Suggested device
design mitigations were generated from this round of test-
ing but not actioned as alterations to the device design at
this stage. In response to feedback, version two of the IFU
was created, as well as a 5-minute training video. The
training video was created to outline the correct technique
in the preparation, application and delivery of the baby
using the BD Odon Device.

 Formative evaluation two (May 2016)
Following
modifications
to
the
training
materials
in
response to the findings of formative evaluation one
(Table 5), 11 na€
ıve staff (seven midwives and four obste-
tricians) participated in formative evaluation two. No
changes have been made to the design of the device fol-
lowing formative round one. Formative evaluation two
was conducted using version two of the IFU and version
two of the device. After exposure to the IFU only, none
of the five participants were able successfully to assist the
birth of the fetal mannequin. However, when participants
were able to watch the training video and were provided
with a 10-minute one-to-one training session, all 11 par-
ticipants were able successfully to deliver the fetal man-
nequin (Table 3).
The majority of new suggested changes generated by the
evaluation were related to the training material rather than
the
device
itself
(Table 6).
For
example,
to
increase
participant knowledge acquisition and retention, the train-
ing video was revised. The video was slowed down and seg-
mented, with written ‘bullet point’ subtitles of information
accompanying each individual step required to perform an
operative vaginal birth using the BD Odon Device.
Formative evaluation three (September 2016)
Prior to this round, modifications were made to the design
of the device (those generated from both formative evalua-
tions one and two; Tables 5 and 6). For example, the grip
on the ‘Applicator’ was enhanced to enable greater traction
during removal of the ‘Applicator’, and the ‘Viewing Win-
dow’ (through which the operator can gauge how far the
air cuff has travelled over the fetal head) was given a larger
relief border, to make it easier for the ‘Viewing Window’ to
be recognised by users. Minor modifications were also
made to the training materials (generated from formative
evaluation two; Table 6).

Using human factors evaluation to improve BDN Odon Device
TM
 Eighteen na€
ıve staff (eight midwives and ten obstetri-
cians) participated in formative round three, which was
conducted using versions three of the BD Odon Device
and IFU, and version two of the training video.
Participants were more likely to be able to use the BD
Odon Device correctly in all three stages (preparation,
application and delivery) following exposure to the device
and IFU alone in comparison with formative round one
(78% during formative round three, compared with 25%
in formative round one). Following exposure to all training
materials, all participants (18) were able to complete more
than 75% of steps correctly in all stages of an OVB using
the BD Odon Device. All 18 participants who successfully
applied the device, were able successfully to deliver the fetal
mannequin.
Following formative evaluation round three, minor changes
were made to the device and training materials (Table 7).
Human factor validation testing (March 2017)
Following minor modifications to the device and training
materials made after formative round three (Table 7), a
HFVT was undertaken. The purpose of the HFVT was to
demonstrate definitively that the BD Odon Device and cor-
responding IFU and training can be used by accouchers
without producing patterns of failures that could result in
a negative impact on patients or harm to users. In all, 36
na€
ıve staff (18 obstetricians and 18 midwives) from 14
countries (UK, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark,
Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, Jordan, India, Nepal
and Australia) participated in the HFVT.
Following exposure to face-to-face training and the IFU,
at their third assessed attempt, all participants were able
successfully to complete more than 75% of all steps
required for use of the device (Table 3). All participants
were able to successfully deliver the fetal mannequin.
Discussion
This is the first published study of the systematic use of HFE
to evaluate and iteratively improve the design and training
materials of a new obstetrical instrument to expedite vaginal
birth. The findings highlight the value of formal human fac-
tors testing before a novel device is introduced into clinical
practice. The observation of midwives and obstetricians
using the device in a simulated setting revealed numerous
potential user errors and difficulties that have now been mit-
igated through revision of both the device design and the
associated training materials. All simulated births were
observed by an obstetrician, R&D engineer and an expert in
human factors. This multi-professional approach ensured
that when a problem was identified, a solution rapidly could
be developed, implemented and evaluated.
When presented with version four of the BD Odon
Device and the associated training materials, all accouchers
were able to successfully deliver a fetal mannequin using
the device in a safe and competent manner, compared with
25% of accouchers using version two of the device and
training materials. This finding suggests that the final ver-
sion four of the BD Odon Device is more intuitive and the
training materials more accessible and understandable to
accouchers; a significant improvement when compared
with version two.
The observation of 390 simulated operative vaginal births
using the BD Odon Device informed numerous improve-
ments to the device design, and also provided an opportu-
nity to modify the associated IFU and training materials
after the identification of common user errors. The use of
simulation for investigation, rather than training, has previ-
ously been used successfully in obstetrics and has been
associated with reduction in neonatal injury: the observa-
tion of 450 simulated births complicated by shoulder dys-
tocia highlighted common user errors and provided an
evidence base for practical training.8 The subsequent imple-
mentation of evidence-based shoulder dystocia training was
associated with an elimination of permanent neonatal bra-
chial plexus injury associated with shoulder dystocia in one
unit.9 Many neonatal injuries associated with vacuum or
forceps are linked to user error,10 and therefore it is vital
to learn from user errors and adapt training to mitigate
risks associated with misuse before the BD Odon Device is
introduced into clinical practice.
Participants had most difficulty preparing and applying
the device, and comparatively little difficulty in using the
device to deliver the fetal head once the device had been
applied. In the second and third round of testing all

 participants who successfully applied the device were able
to deliver the fetal head successfully. It is perhaps not sur-
prising that participants struggled with the initial stages, as
the preparation and application of the device requires a
completely novel technique. However, once the BD Odon
Device is applied, the technique required to achieve a vagi-
nal birth has similarities to that used during births assisted
with both forceps and vacuum. Indeed, delivering the fetal
head using a BD Odon Device mimics the dynamics of a
spontaneous vaginal birth, a concept that should be famil-
iar to all accoucheurs. When training accoucheurs to use
the BD Odon Device, the relative novelty of the prepara-
tion and application stages must be considered.
We chose to recruit both midwives and obstetricians to
the study. While UK midwives are not specifically the ini-
tial intended -users of the BD Odon Device (although mid-
wives in other international settings where midwifery
practice routinely includes OVB, may be), UK midwives in
this study (represented in formative rounds one, two and
three and HFVT) represent a cohort of accoucheurs who
are clearly familiar with the dynamics of a spontaneous
vaginal birth but have never performed an instrumental
birth. When launched into practice it is hoped the BD
Odon Device will be used to reduce morbidity in settings
where instrumental birth is not currently commonly per-
formed.11 Accouchers working in this environment will be
familiar with the dynamics of a spontaneous vaginal birth
but are likely to be relatively unfamiliar with instrumental
births. The device will also provide an alternative instru-
ment to obstetricians who frequently perform instrumental
births using forceps and/or vacuum. As such, the intended
end-users of the BD Odon Device will have vastly different
prior experience of instrumental birth; this may affect how
users interact with, and use, the device. In an attempt to

Using human factors evaluation to improve BDN Odon Device

 address this issue, we recruited midwives and obstetricians
across a spectrum of clinical experience to participate in
the study. It is encouraging, therefore, that following train-
ing there was no significant difference between the perfor-
mance of midwives and obstetricians, using either the
initial or final version of the BD Odon Device, IFU and
training materials (Table 4).
The techniques required to perform an operative vaginal
birth using non-rotational forceps or vacuum are broadly
standardised in internationally recognised national guideli-
nes [Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists,12

�ais 15] and we therefore do
not anticipate that experienced users from different settings
will interact with the device in a significantly different man-
ner. This is in addition to the results of the HFVT within our
study, which demonstrated similar levels of success across
participants of 14 separate national backgrounds (Table 3).
This suggests that there is a common degree of understand-
ing of the process of normal and assisted birth among the
intended future users of the BD Odon Device. This com-
monality of knowledge would potentially allow a desirable
distributed model of training to be successful. Models such
as this, where skills are taught by centrally trained local fac-
ulty to local trainees, and which have been used previously
to disseminate ‘best-practice’ strategies to deal with universal
obstetric procedures, such as manoeuvres for shoulder dys-
tocia, have been demonstrated to result in sustained knowl-
edge acquisition,16 to be relatively low-cost,17 and to
improve real-world outcomes in a variety of settings.9,18,19
The adoption of the BD Odon Device into clinical prac-
tice necessitates the acquisition of a new skill by accouch-
ers.

3 Difficult to pull down the fastening band to lubricate
the sleeve and then pull the fastening band back up
prior to insertion
3 Fastening band re-designed to cover whole length of applicator
4 Users struggled, or forgot, to remove the fastening
band
4 Red unfastening button added to base of fastening band
IFU & training
1 Training video too fast
1 Training video remade at slower pace with longer pauses/
segments

 clinicians of all abilities are able to acquire and utilise the
required skills efficiently and effectively. The challenge of
introducing a novel medical device into obstetric practice
should not be underestimated. However, the collaboration
between clinicians, R&D engineers and human factor spe-
cialists has provided a rigorous evaluation and rapid cycles
of iterative improvement of both the device and training
package. The human factors evaluations have not only
aided in the development of the BD Odon Device and IFU
but have also ensured that the BD Odon Device is able to
be used safely and effectively without producing patterns of
human or device failures that could result in poor clinical
outcomes prior to in vivo testing.
