(2008) found that 77% of young autistic adults in their sam-
ple had additional mental health diagnoses, including anxi-
ety, depression and bipolar disorder. Other studies suggest 
that the prevalence of depression in autistic individuals is 
around 34% (Stewart et al. 2006). Anxiety is also frequently 
found to be higher in the autistic population than within the 
non-autistic population (Gillott and Standen 2007), along-
side a higher prevalence of social anxiety disorder (Maddox 
and White 2015). Difficulties with mental health are conse-
quently thought to contribute to a poorer quality of life in 
autism (Robertson 2009).
Given this high prevalence of mental health difficulties, it 
is vital to understand why those on the autism spectrum are 
at a higher risk. There are a number of possible factors that 
could contribute to this prevalence. The current study adopts 
the “social model approach” as a means of explaining mental 
health comorbidity in autism. The social model claims that 
factors external to the individual cause disabling features 
(Shakespeare 2006)—for example, an employer’s attitudes 
or lack of understanding of autism could prevent autistic 
individuals from finding employment, rather than difficul-
ties an individual may experience as a result of autism itself. 
When applying the social model to mental health in autism, 
one factor—and the focus of the current study—that could 
impact on mental health is an individual’s experiences and 
perceptions of autism acceptance. Other factors which may 
affect mental health in autism may include sensory sensi-
tivities (Green and Ben-Sasson 2010) and intolerance of 
uncertainty (Maisel et al. 2016). The current study focused 
Abstract Mental health difficulties are highly prevalent in 
individuals on the autism spectrum. The current study exam-
ined how experiences and perceptions of autism acceptance 
could impact on the mental health of autistic adults. 111 
adults on the autism spectrum completed an online survey 
examining their experiences of autism acceptance, along 
with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Regres-
sion analyses showed that autism acceptance from exter-
nal sources and personal acceptance significantly predicted 
depression. Acceptance from others also significantly pre-
dicted stress but acceptance did not predict anxiety. Further 
analyses suggested that experiences of “camouflaging” could 
relate to higher rates of depression. The current study high-
lights the importance of considering how autism acceptance 
could contribute to mental health in autism.

Introduction
Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition which 
affects the way individuals process the world; autistic1 
individuals show differences in their social communica-
tion, social interactions, sensory sensitivities, along with 
restricted and repetitive interests and behaviours (APA 
2013). The prevalence of comorbid mental health condi-
tions in autism is strikingly high. For example, Eaves and Ho

on autism acceptance as it has been little explored as a risk 
factor for mental health issues in autistic adults.
Autism acceptance can be defined as an individual feeling 
accepted or appreciated as an autistic person, with autism 
positively recognised and accepted by others and the self as 
an integral part of that individual. Autism acceptance from 
others could be important for autistic individuals’ mental 
health for a number of reasons. Within the mental health 
literature, perceived stigma from others is thought to con-
tribute negatively to the mental health of stigmatised groups 
(Mak et al. 2007). In terms of stigma against autistic people, 
Sasson et al. (2017) found that non-autistic individuals tend 
to make rapid unfavourable judgements about those on the 
autism spectrum. In their study, neurotypical participants 
rated pictures or videos without knowing that some of the 
people in the videos were on the autism spectrum. Find-
ings showed that the autistic people were rated as less like-
able, less attractive and that the participant would be less 
likely to engage with them socially, suggesting that societal 
acceptance may be poor. Moreover, when interviewed about 
their experiences of acceptance from society, adults on the 
autism spectrum reported that a lack of public understand-
ing was contributing to their experiences of social isolation 
and anxiety (Griffith et al. 2012). Studies examining autism 
acceptance additionally indicate that although non-autistic 
people are aware of autism (Dillenburger et al. 2013, 2015), 
misunderstandings and misconceptions are common none-
theless, such as believing that changing an autistic child’s 
diet can lessen symptoms, or that autism can be outgrown 
(Tipton and Blacher 2014). Further, unconscious biases 
towards autism can still be prevailingly negative even in 
those who work regularly with autistic children (Kelly and 
Barnes-Holmes 2013).
In terms of acceptance from closer social networks, 
having the opportunity to engage with others who are like-
minded and to develop one’s sense of belonging is thought 
to be important to the well-being of autistic adults (Mil-
ton and Sims 2016). Indeed, sense of belonging is argued 
to be vital to the well being of all individuals, irrespective 
of autism (Baumeister and Leary 1995). Research has also 
suggested that previous experience of contact with autistic 
individuals is associated with greater autism acceptance in 
university students (Gardiner and Iarocci 2014) and those 
with a family member on the autism spectrum tend to be 
more accepting and open towards autism (Nevill and White 
2011). Longitudinal studies have also shown that autistic 
individuals believe supportive family and friends help them 
to develop greater feelings of self-worth (Hurlbutt and Chal-
mers 2002). Equally, parents of autistic children who dem-
onstrate higher acceptance of their child’s autism have been 
found to have fewer mental health problems (Weiss et al. 
2012). Additionally, in a study where loneliness was posi-
tively correlated with anxiety and depression, individuals on 
the autism spectrum who reported having more friends expe-
rienced fewer feelings of loneliness, as well as fewer anxious 
and depressive symptoms (Mazurek 2014). As such, it may 
be that feeling accepted by others could act as a protective 
factor against mental health problems.
Personal acceptance is also an important variable within 
mental health—for example, unconditional self-acceptance 
in non-clinical samples has been shown to negatively cor-
relate with anxiety (Chamberlain and Haaga 2001) and 
depression (Flett et al. 2003). Many autistic people want to 
be accepted for being “who they are” and take pride in being 
neurodivergent, a term (alongside neurodiversity) used to 
describe differences in the way people think, with diversity 
in the brain an important and celebrated part of human varia-
tion (Cage et al. 2016a; Humphrey and Lewis 2008; Hurlbutt 
and Chalmers 2002; Jaarsma and Welin 2012; Robertson 
2009). Therefore, the current study also considered personal 
acceptance of being on the autism spectrum. Kapp et al. 
(2013) noted that those who self-identified more strongly 
with the concept of neurodiversity tended to view autism 
itself more positively. Recent research has also indicated that 
identifying positively with an autistic identity mediates the 
relationship between self-esteem and mental health difficul-
ties, suggesting that personal acceptance of autism as part of 
one’s identity could protect against depression and anxiety 
(Cooper et al. 2017). Despite this, many autistic individu-
als frequently report “masking” or “camouflaging”—that is, 
they may use strategies to camouflage the fact they are on 
the autism spectrum in order to “fit in” to the non-autistic 
world (Dean et al. 2016; Hull et al. 2017). Camouflaging 
one’s identity as an autistic person could have a subsequent 
impact on experiences of acceptance, if one is not “out” as 
being on the autism spectrum.
To the best of our knowledge, no research has directly 
examined autistic adults’ perceptions and experiences of 
autism acceptance and their relation to mental health dif-
ficulties. It is not known how autism acceptance from both 
self and others relates to mental health outcomes for autistic 
adults. The current research thus aimed to test the relation-
ship between perceived autism acceptance and mental health 
(specifically, depression, anxiety and stress) in a sample of 
autistic adults. We hypothesised those autistic adults who 
experienced less autism acceptance would show greater 
prevalence of the symptoms of depression, anxiety and 
stress.
Methods
Participants
Autistic adults over the age of 18 were recruited via a 
range of means; these included sharing a link to the online

survey on social media or through autism organisations 
and groups in the UK. A link to the survey was provided 
for individuals wishing to participate. Groups and organi-
sations were initially contacted with an explanation of the 
study via email, and were invited to participate and share 
the survey. Adverts were also placed on the websites of 
Research Autism and Autism West Midlands. Participants 
who completed the whole survey were entered into a prize 
draw to win a £50 voucher.
A total of 111 individuals completed the survey, 
although 9 of these participants did not complete all of the 
demographic questions. 54 participants reported that they 
had a diagnosis of an autism spectrum condition (49%) 
and 73 participants reported a diagnosis of Asperger’s 
Syndrome (66%) - with overlap due to some participants 
selecting both options—which could reflect the current 
categorisation of Asperger’s Syndrome and autism under 
the umbrella category of “autism spectrum disorder” in the 
DSM-5 (APA 2013). Two participants reported a diagnosis 
of pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise speci-
fied. Further, 11 participants reported that they did not 
currently have a formal diagnosis of autism. These partici-
pants were not included in the regression analyses, since 
we controlled for age of diagnosis. However, we decided 
to include these individuals in other analyses since remov-
ing their responses did not alter any of the other results. 
Further, 84% self-reported additional mental health diag-
noses or developmental conditions. This included depres-
sion (n = 57), anxiety (n = 62), social anxiety (n = 35), 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 18), obsessive 
compulsive disorder (n = 18), post-traumatic stress disor-
der (n = 9), bipolar disorder (n = 7) and Tourette’s syn-
drome (n = 4).
Data collection took place from June 2016 to October 
2016. The median time to complete the survey was 12 min. 
All participants gave full informed consent to participa-
tion and all responses were recorded anonymously. Ethical 
approval for this study was obtained through  Royal Hol-
loway, University of London.
Participants were asked a number of demographic ques-
tions to establish the nature of the sample. The mean age of 
participants at the time of the survey was 36.4 (SD = 12.0), 
with a range from 18 to 72 years old. Mean age of diagno-
sis was 31.4 (SD = 14.0), ranging from 4 to 69 years old. 
Information on gender identity, sexual identity, employment, 
education and ethnicity is shown in Table 1. Demographic 
information demonstrated that the current sample mostly 
consisted of female, heterosexual, well-educated White Brit-
ish participants. Although women were not specifically tar-
geted, the survey attracted substantially more autistic women 
than men. This could be due to women being more likely 
to complete surveys (Sax et al. 2003) or the topic being of 
particular interest to women.

Materials and Procedure
Before the study commenced, the proposal for this research 
was reviewed by several autistic adults, to ensure that the 
research was in line with the priorities of the autism commu-
nity—since all too often, autistic individuals are not involved 
in the research process itself (Pellicano et al. 2014). Feed-
back was positive and their advice was taken on board in 
ensuring question wording within the survey was clear and 
transparent.
Participants completed the survey online using the Qual-
trics survey platform. Online survey methods were utilised 
in this research as this method is an efficient way to examine 
the suggested hypothesis. After giving consent, participants 
were asked for their preference of person-first (“person with 
autism”) or identity-first (“autistic person”) language, as 
there is debate around the use of these terms (Kenny et al. 
2016). Results showed that 62% of our sample preferred 
identity-first language. Selection of preferred term meant 
that all of the survey questions reflected the individual’s 
preference where appropriate. Following this, participants 
first reported their diagnoses and age of autism diagnosis, 
followed by questions concerning experiences of acceptance, 
then the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), 
and finally demographic questions.
Autism Acceptance Questions
To the best of our knowledge, there is no pre-existing meas-
ure designed to measure autistic individuals’ perceptions of 
autism acceptance. The current study aimed to quantify their 
perceptions of autism acceptance. First, participants were 
asked whether they felt that society (specified as the gen-
eral public, made up of people who did not personally know 
them) generally accepted them, with “yes”, “no”, “some-
times” and “prefer not to say” as response options. These 
response options were used to obtain a categorical response 
for acceptance. Second, they were asked to rate the state-
ment “over the past week, I have felt accepted by society as 
an autistic person/person with autism”, on a 5-point scale 
from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”. These response 
options were used to fit with the standardised 5-point scale 
used elsewhere in the survey (e.g. the DASS-21). Finally, 
to assess perceptions of autism acceptance from differ-
ent sources, participants were also asked to report “how 
accepted by society do you feel as an autistic person”, “how 
accepted by your family and friends do you feel as an autistic 
person”, and “how much have you personally accepted your-
self as an autistic person” on a scale from zero (“not at all”) 
to ten (“completely”). Validation of these items is discussed 
in the “Results” section.
Further, open textboxes were used to obtain qualitative 
responses, such that participants could “tell us more about 
[their] experiences of acceptance or non-acceptance”. Con-
tent analysis was subsequently conducted on these qualitative 
responses. Here, responses were first screened for common 
themes by two independent coders (JDM and VN) who famil-
iarised themselves separately with the data. Categories were 
then agreed upon, discrepancies resolved and all responses 
were grouped into the categories by the two coders indepen-
dently. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using the ReCal 
program (Freelon 2010) and is reported in the “Results” 
section.
Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS‑21)
The DASS-21 (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995) is a self-report 
scale used to measure depression, anxiety and stress. This 
measure consists of 21 items and is a short version of the full 
42 item DASS. We used the short version as it is shown to 
have as good reliability and validity as the long version (Cron-
bach’s alpha 0.94, 0.87 and 0.91 for the depression, anxiety 
and stress subscales respectively, Antony et al. 1998; Ng et al. 
2007), along with good construct validity (Henry and Craw-
ford 2005). The DASS-21 has also previously been used with 
autistic adults (Maddox and White 2015). Participants were 
asked to rate 21 statements and to judge whether they could be 
applied to their life over the past week, on a scale from one to 
four (1 = did not apply to me at all; 2 = applied to me some of 
the time; 3 = applied to me a considerable degree; 4 = applied 
to me very much or most of the time). The 21 items could be 
divided into 7 items each for depression, anxiety and stress 
scales. A total score for each scale (depression, anxiety and 
stress) was computed and multiplied by two (maximum pos-
sible score for each scale = 42). Internal consistency in the cur-
rent sample showed high consistency for the depression (Cron-
bach’s alpha = 0.919) and stress (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.842) 
scales, while the anxiety scale had acceptable consistency 
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.790). These estimates are similar to 
previous research using the DASS with autistic adults (0.888, 
0.861 and 0.805 for depression, stress and anxiety subscales 
respectively, Maddox and White 2015).
Design
This cross-sectional study had a correlational design. The 
outcome variable was mental health (depression, anxiety or 
stress score on the DASS) and the main predictor variables of 
interest were perceptions of autism acceptance.

Results
Autism Acceptance
When asked whether they felt society, in general, accepted 
them as an autistic person, 7% of participants said “yes”, 
43% said “no” and 48% said “sometimes” (2% preferred 
not to say). Participants were also asked to rate the state-
ment “over the past week, I have felt accepted by society 
as an autistic person/person with autism”; 24.3% strongly 
agreed or agreed, 34% neither agreed nor disagreed, and 
41.4% disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement.
The validity of the three items examining autism accept-
ance from society, family and friends, and personal accept-
ance of autism diagnosis was assessed. As shown in Table 2, 
perceived acceptance from society and family and friends 
correlated significantly with ratings of acceptance from soci-
ety over the past week. Personal acceptance did not correlate 
with this item or perceived societal acceptance, but did cor-
relate with family and friend acceptance (r = .21, p = .027).
The three items assessing autism acceptance from the 
three sources were then assessed using principal com-
ponent analysis (PCA) to test whether the items were 
measuring one overall construct of perceived acceptance, 
or if they were measuring acceptance from three sepa-
rate sources. The KMO statistic was acceptable (0.528), 
individual item KMO values were above 0.74, and Bar-
tlett’s test of sphericity was significant (χ2 (3) = 33.66, 
p < .001), indicating that PCA was appropriate with the 
current sample size (Field 2013). The analysis extracted 
one component (eigenvalue 1.57) explaining 52.46% of 
total variance. The factor loadings of the three items onto 
this component indicated that perceived acceptance from 
society (factor loading = 0.801) and family and friends 
(0.848) loaded significantly onto one component. How-
ever, personal acceptance did not load significantly onto 
the component (factor loading = 0.462; according to Ste-
vens’ (2002, as cited in Field 2013) recommendation that 
only loadings greater than 0.512 for a sample size of 100 
are statistically significant). Further, when testing for reli-
ability using Cronbach’s alpha, removal of the personal 
acceptance item increased Cronbach’s alpha from 0.51 
to a more acceptable value of 0.64. Given these results, 
the two items considering societal acceptance and family 
and friend acceptance were combined into a measure of 
“external sources of acceptance”, and that personal autism 
acceptance was considered as a separate construct.
Mean ratings of perceived acceptance, on a scale from 
zero (“not at all”) to ten (“completely”) from external 
sources (society, family and friends) and personal accept-
ance are shown in Table 3, showing that personal autism 
acceptance was greater than perceived acceptance from 
external sources, t(110) = 7.93, p < .001, 2-tailed, d = 0.76.
Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
The mean for the DASS depression score was 17.8 
(SD = 12.7), with scores ranging from 0 to 42. The mean 
for DASS anxiety score was 12.9, (SD = 9.14), ranging 
from 0 to 40. Finally, the mean DASS stress score was 
22.3 (SD = 9.96), ranging from 0 to 42. These scores are 
similar to those reported in Maddox and White (2015) 
study with autistic adults (although they did not multiply 
the results by two), but are significantly higher than the 
means reported in the non-autistic population (for exam-
ple, Henry and Crawford (2005) report the means from 
depression (5.66), anxiety (3.76) and stress (9.46) scores 
in 1794 non-autistic, non-clinical participants).

Autism Acceptance and Mental Health
Considering the relationships between acceptance and 
mental health, Spearman’s correlational analyses showed 
that societal acceptance over the past week correlated sig-
nificantly with DASS depression scores (ρ (107) = 0.288, 
p = .002) and DASS stress scores (ρ (109) = 0.281, p = .003); 
but there was no significant correlation with DASS anxiety 
scores (ρ (106) = 0.096, p = .32).
Further regression analyses were conducted to test 
whether acceptance from external sources or personal 
acceptance could predict mental health symptoms. Three 
separate hierarchical regressions with depression, anxiety 
and stress as the outcome variables were conducted. Block-
wise entry was used to analyse the data; age, age of diagno-
sis, gender and the other DASS scales (since the scales were 
highly correlated with one another, Table 4) were entered 
into the first step for each model. In the second step, the two 
types of acceptance (external sources and personal) were 
entered. Several participants (n = 27) were not included in 
the final analyses as they had missing data for one or more 
of the variables. Correlations between the three DASS scales 
and predictor variables are shown in Table 4.
First, depression was considered as the outcome variable; 
the first step explained 34.6% of the variance in depression 
scores, and adding the acceptance variables as predictors in 
step two could explain 52.1% of the variance, a significant 
change (p < .001). The final model was also a significant fit 
to the data (F (7, 83) = 11.80, p < .001). This final model 
shows that age of diagnosis, anxiety, external acceptance and 
personal acceptance could significantly predict depression 
scores (Table 5).
Figure 1 demonstrates the relationship between depres-
sion,  external acceptance and personal acceptance—indi-
cating that there was a relationship between depression and 
autism acceptance such that greater levels of depression 
were associated with less perceived acceptance from exter-
nal sources and less personal acceptance.
Next, stress was entered as the outcome variable. The first 
step explained 54% of the variance in depression scores, and 
adding the acceptance variables in step two explained 57% 
of the variance, a non-significant change (p = .11). The final 
model was a significant fit to the data, F (7, 83) = 14.32, 
p < .001. This final model shows that anxiety and external 
acceptance significantly predicted stress scores (Table 6). 
With increasing stress scores, participants perceived less 
autism acceptance from external sources (Fig. 2).
Finally, anxiety was tested as the outcome variable; here 
the first step explained 52% of the variance in depression 
scores, and adding the acceptance variables in step two 
explained 54% of the variance, a non-significant change 
(p = .21). The final model was a significant fit to the data, 
F (7, 83) = 12.61, p < .001. This final model shows that age 
of diagnosis, depression and stress scores significantly pre-
dicted anxiety scores (Table 7).

autism acceptance. Content analysis was used to examine 
and categorise these responses, with four broad themes 
agreed upon: positive acceptance experiences, negative 
acceptance experiences, consequences of acceptance/non-
acceptance, and an “other” category. Within these themes, 
21 sub-categories were agreed. The categories are shown 
below in Table 8. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using 
kappa coefficients, demonstrating that 12 categories had 
almost perfect agreement, 7 had substantial agreement and 
2 had moderate agreement (following the guidelines for 
agreement by Landis and Koch (1977)).
The categories with the most responses were misunder-
standings and misconceptions about autism, experiences of 
masking/camouflaging, negative acceptance experiences 
from society and from specific organisations, mental health 
difficulties, and difficulties with social interactions. Example 
quotes from each of these categories are shown in Table 9.
A subset of participants spontaneously reported experi-
ences of “masking” or “camouflaging” the fact that they 
were on the autism spectrum (n = 27). These qualitative 
reports indicated a potential relationship between experi-
ences of camouflaging and mental health, with some partici-
pants reporting how camouflaging had a detrimental effect 
on their psychological wellbeing. Exploratory analyses were 
thus conducted to examine the hypothesis that camouflaging

could have negative effects on mental health. A two (camou-
flaging: yes or no) × three (DASS scale: depression, anxiety 
or stress) mixed ANOVA was conducted on DASS scores, 
to test whether camouflaging related to symptoms of mental 
health. There was a main effect of DASS (F (2, 212) = 37.45, 
p < .001, ηp2 =0.26), with planned contrasts using Bonfer-
roni showing that overall more depression was reported 
than anxiety (p < .001), but significantly less depression 
than stress (p = .037), as well as more stress than anxiety 
(p < .001). There was no main effect of camouflaging (F 
(1, 106) = 2.46, p = .12, ηp2 = 0.023). There was a signifi-
cant interaction between camouflaging and the DASS (F (2, 
212) = 4.55, p = .012, ηp2 = 0.041). Planned contrasts using 
t tests showed only significant differences in depression 
between those who reported camouflaging and those who 
did not (t (107) = − 0.256, p = .012, g = 0.56), with those who 
spontaneously reported camouflaging also reporting higher 
depression. Further exploratory analyses showed that when 
asked how accepted over the past week they had felt, those 
who reported camouflaging were more likely to disagree 
that they had experienced acceptance (Likelihood ratio: 
 
X2(2) = 6.68, p = .035). Finally, there was no significant 
gender differences in spontaneous reports of camouflaging 
(Likelihood ratio  
X2(2) = 0.60, p = .740).
Discussion
The current study aimed to test the relationship between 
autism acceptance and mental health (specifically, depres-
sion, anxiety and stress) in autistic adults. We hypothesised 
that autistic adults who experienced less acceptance would 
show a greater prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress 
symptoms. Findings showed that depression was predicted 
by autism acceptance from external sources (society, family 
and friends) and personal acceptance. Stress was predicted 
only by acceptance from external sources. There was no 
relationship between anxiety and autism acceptance.
The finding that depression was predicted by accept-
ance from external sources makes sense if the importance 
of supportive others is first considered. For example, Hurl-
butt and Chalmers (2002) claim that families have  a large 
role in helping autistic individuals develop the skills needed 
to become successful adults in society. Further, for adults 
and adolescents with Asperger’s Syndrome, Tantam (2000) 
argued that the care and support of family members who 
accept an individual’s anxiety can protect against the devel-
opment of depression. Lasgaard et al. (2010) also noted that 
perceived social support from family and peers was nega-
tively correlated with loneliness in autistic adolescents. 
Feeling accepted by others as an autistic person could be a 
protective factor against depression.
Further, we also found that greater personal autism 
acceptance predicted lower depressive symptoms. Indeed, a 
recent study by Cooper et al. (2017) showed that identifying

with an autistic identity was positively associated with 
self-esteem, mediating an association with depression and 
anxiety. Cooper et al. (2017) suggest that autistic identity 
could act as a protective factor against mental health diffi-
culties, which the current findings would support if personal 
acceptance is considered to be related to identity. It could 
be argued that the relationship between depression and per-
sonal acceptance is mediated by self-esteem—with accept-
ance serving to boost self-esteem and thus protect against 
depression. The possible relationship with self-esteem may 
also explain why only depression was associated with per-
sonal acceptance, since feelings of self-worth are part of 
depression but not anxiety or stress (APA 2013). Further, a 
meta-analysis of whether self-esteem predicted depression 
and anxiety in a non-autistic sample found the directional 
effect of self-esteem on depression was stronger than the 
effect of depression on self-esteem (Sowislo and Orth 2013). 
Future research considering acceptance should endeavour to 
measure self-esteem and clarify its relationship with mental 
health and autism acceptance.
We also found that stress was predicted by exter-
nal sources of autism acceptance. Arguably, it is stress-
ful to not be accepted by others. In the social psychology 
literature, social support has been shown to protect against 
stress (Haslam et al. 2005). For example, less stress is seen 
in workplaces where others are more accepting and sup-
portive of whom an individual wants to be (Lang and Lee 
2005). However, autistic individuals may struggle to feel 
accepted by various individuals - with research suggesting 
that they experience less social support from others as well 
as perceiving more stress (Bishop-Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). 
More research is needed to understand how autistic individu-
als’ experiences of acceptance might contribute to levels 
of stress, along with how external support might serve as 
protective factor.
In this study, participants’ qualitative responses add an 
additional dimension and further insight into their experi-
ences. These responses revealed many in the sample “cam-
ouflaged”—in other words, they acted as though non-autistic 
or “neurotypical”. Being able to pretend or act as neurotypi-
cal fits with the idea that autistic individuals are capable of 
reputation management, and supports evidence that autistic 
individuals can present themselves in a specific light (Begeer 
et al. 2008; Cage et al. 2013, 2016a, b; Scheeren et al. 2010, 
2015). Importantly, the current results indicate that this 
effort may be detrimental to mental health, with those who

Misunderstandings and misconceptions 29 “People don’t seem to understand that autism affects every single aspect of who 
I am as a person, and telling me there should be a cure is telling me I shouldn’t 
exist... I can’t feel accepted by society until society understands that autistic 
people sometimes need support, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but there is 
something very wrong with wanting to change an autistic person into someone 
else entirely.”
“Because my responses are slightly different from neurotypical people I am some-
times regarded as mentally ill when I am not. I find this very frustrating.”
From society
13 “Generally I don’t think society accepts the traits that often go hand in hand with 
autism though and I therefore am also very pessimistic about the integration of 
people with autism into society.”
From specific organisations (e.g. work-
place, educational settings, etc.)
11 “Since being diagnosed I have found that, other than specific autism support 
services, mention of autism is met blankly or dismissed, even by those who have 
remarked on my oddity. I have told my employers, and they acknowledge what I 
have told them but don’t really understand what it means to me.”

ance/non-

Experiences of camouflaging/masking
27 “I do not exhibit symptoms much or am able to mask/hide them almost com-
pletely”
“I have to invest a lot of energy into “passing” as neurotypical”
“I feel that I have spent the majority of my life engaged in the search for accept-
ance and therefore I can fake neurotypical behaviour pretty well.”
“I mask well so I am accepted but not as an autistic person.”
Mental health
8 “[Masking] is incredibly exhausting and stressful and has ultimately led to mental 
and physical health problems.”
“As the years pass I suffer increasing anxiety for lack of even casual acceptance by 
my species and, conversely, huge spikes of anxiety when someone actually does 
‘see’ me. Invisibility has become my comfort zone as well as my prison.”
Difficulties with social interactions
8 “After a lifetime of observing people, trying to work out why I am different and so 
isolated, it seems to me that my lack of comprehension of non-verbal communi-
cation limits my interaction with NTs looking for expected responses and results 
in them looking past me.”

reported camouflaging also reporting higher symptoms of 
depression and fewer experiences of acceptance in the past 
week. Additionally, recent research has attempted to explain 
gender differences in the diagnosis of autism as females are 
suggested to be better at camouflaging than males (Bargiela 
et al. 2016; Dean et al. 2016; Lai et al. 2017; Tierney et al. 
2016). However, the current study did not find any gender 
difference in spontaneous reports of camouflaging, with 
men just as likely to report camouflaging as women. More 
research is needed to further understand camouflaging and 
its relationship to mental health in autism.
Interestingly, autism acceptance did not predict anxiety. 
It could be the case that other non-social factors play more 
of a role in anxiety in autism. For example, intolerance of 
uncertainty is an important concept within anxiety disor-
ders regardless of autism (Carleton et al. 2012), where being 
unable to deal with the uncertain aggravates anxiety. In both 
autistic children and adults, intolerance of uncertainty has 
been shown to relate to anxiety (Boulter et al. 2014; Mai-
sel et al. 2016). Another factor which is thought to play an 
important role in anxiety in autism is sensory sensitivities 
(Green and Ben-Sasson 2010). Interestingly, Neil, Olsson 
and Pellicano (2016) found that intolerance of uncertainty 
and anxiety were related to autistic children’s sensory sen-
sitivities, suggesting that there could be a dynamic interplay 
between different variables and mental health outcomes. 
More research is needed to examine a wide range of social 
and non-social risk factors for mental health difficulties in 
autism.
It is also worth considering how Theory of Mind abil-
ity may impact on perceptions of autism acceptance. It is 
hypothesised that autistic individuals have a difficultly with 
understanding other’s perspectives (Baron-Cohen et al. 
1985), which could affect whether the individual can accu-
rately recognise how accepted they are by other people. 
However, research has shown that autistic individuals can 
theorise about other minds, and this ability is dependent on 
cognitive ability (Bowler 1992), task demands (Peterson 
et al. 2013) and whether automatic or conscious Theory of 
Mind is being tested (Senju et al. 2009). A recent study by 
Heasman and Gillespie (2017) also demonstrated that neuro-
typical family members tended to underestimate their autis-
tic family member’s perspective-taking ability. Arguably, it 
is therefore important that autistic people’s ability to reflect 
upon their experiences of autism acceptance is not under-
estimated. Mixed methods, as used in the current study, are 
a key way of validating and supporting autistic individuals’ 
experiences.
The current study is not without its limitations. First, 
online survey methods rely on self-report which may be 
deemed unreliable. As a means of testing an initial hypoth-
esis, though, we believe that online survey methods are 
effective in reaching a large sample, in a means that is 
accessible to many autistic people. Second, the participants 
in this study were predominantly female, which may limit 
the generalisability of the findings. Despite this, gender was 
not a significant predictor in any of the analyses. Further, the 
experiences of autistic women have been overlooked (Pelli-
cano et al. 2014), thus the reports from the current study are 
arguably of great value in helping enhance understanding of 
the experiences of autistic women, even if those experiences 
are not that different to men. Third, as well as autism, a 
high proportion of participants reported additional diagnoses 
which could suggest that the survey attracted autistic adults 
who had already experienced or were currently experiencing 
mental health difficulties, and the results may not be appli-
cable to those who experience lower incidences of mental 
health problems. However, research shows that comorbid 
mental health difficulties are highly prevalent in autism (e.g. 
Eaves and Ho 2008), thus the current findings are relevant 
to a large proportion of the autistic population. Finally, the 
current sample also mainly consisted of well-educated indi-
viduals who would not be representative of the whole autism 
spectrum. More research is clearly needed to include a wider 
variety of individuals on the autism spectrum. Based on the 
current study’s limitations, future research should aim to 
access a wide range of autistic people using both online and 
offline surveys. Given the paucity of research into experi-
ences of autism acceptance and its relationship to mental 
health, further in-depth qualitative research would also be 
advantageous for enhancing our understanding of these 
experiences.
Nonetheless, we believe that this study offers novel 
insight into the importance of autism acceptance for autis-
tic adults and their mental health. Future research should 
further examine how mental health difficulties in autistic 
individuals can be protected against by improving autism 
acceptance. Interventions designed to improve family and/
or peer support should be tested, as well as those intended to 
boost personal acceptance or self-esteem. For example, peer 
mentoring has been examined in a Higher Education context 
and been shown to have the potential to improve autistic 
students’ self-esteem (Lucas and James 2017). We would 
particularly advocate for interventions designed alongside 
autistic people, with a focus on neurodiversity (Gillespie-
Lynch et al. 2017). Wider societal acceptance should also 
be strived for to reduce the need for autistic adults to camou-
flage, and instead be accepted as they are. Overall, the cur-
rent study demonstrated relationships between experiences 
of autism acceptance, depression and stress in a sample 
of autistic adults. There is still a long way to go in under-
standing and tackling the high prevalence of mental health 
difficulties in autism, but we believe that the social model 
approach is a useful and positive lens through which mental 
health outcomes could be improved.
