 ABSTRACT 
35 
 
36 
Surface electromyographic (EMG) signal amplitude is typically used to compare the neural 
37 
drive to muscles. We experimentally investigated this association by studying the motor unit 
38 
(MU) behavior and action potentials in the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) 
39 
muscles. Eighteen participants performed isometric knee extensions at four target torques 
40 
[10, 30, 50 and 70% of the maximum torque (MVC)] while high-density EMG signals were 
41 
recorded from the VM and VL. The absolute EMG amplitude was greater for VM than VL 
42 
(p<0.001) while the EMG amplitude normalized with respect to MVC was greater for VL 
43 
than VM (p<0.04). Because differences in EMG amplitude can be due to both differences in 
44 
the neural drive and in the size of the MU action potentials, we indirectly inferred the neural 
45 
drives received by the two muscles by estimating the synaptic inputs received by the 
46 
corresponding motor neuron pools. For this purpose, we analyzed the increase in discharge 
47 
rate from recruitment to target torque for motor units matched by recruitment threshold in the 
48 
two muscles. This analysis indicated that the two muscles received similar levels of neural 
49 
drive. Nonetheless, the size of the MU action potentials was greater for VM than VL 
50 
(p<0.001) and this difference explained most of the differences in EMG amplitude between 
51 
the two muscles (~63% of explained variance). These results indicate that EMG amplitude, 
52 
even following normalization, does not reflect the neural drive to synergistic muscles. 
53 
Moreover, absolute EMG amplitude is mainly explained by the size of MU action potentials. 
54 
 
55 
New and Noteworthy 
56 
EMG amplitude is widely used to indirectly compare the strength of neural drive received by 
57 
synergistic muscles. However, there are no studies validating this approach with motor unit 
58 
data. Here, we compared between-muscles differences in surface EMG amplitude and motor 
59 
unit behavior. The results clarify the limitations of surface EMG to interpret differences in 
60 
neural drive between muscles.

 INTRODUCTION 
69 
 
70 
Surface electromyography (EMG) amplitude depends on the level of muscle activation 
71 
(number of muscle fiber action potentials) and it is typically used to infer the strength of 
72 
neural drive (number of motor neuron action potentials) received by muscles (6). Changes in 
73 
the relative activations of synergistic muscles are believed to be associated to the 
74 
development of musculoskeletal disorders (19). For example, researchers argue that 
75 
pathologies such as patellofemoral joint pain and Achilles tendinopathy might occur due to 
76 
misbalanced activation of the vasti and calf muscles, respectively (17, 19). For patellofemoral 
77 
joint pain, it is assumed that a greater activation of the vastus lateralis (VL) compared to the 
78 
vastus medialis (VM) muscle induces a lateral shift of the patella, leading to misalignment of 
79 
the patellofemoral joint (17, 19). Although these explanations seem plausible, there is still no 
80 
consensus in the literature (7, 31), mainly because of limitations of surface EMG amplitude in 
81 
measuring the neural drive (6). While normalization of EMG amplitude with respect to its 
82 
value during a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) may increase reliability when 
83 
comparing between subjects (4), normalization may cancel out changes in muscle activation 
84 
following, e.g., training interventions. It has been recently shown that high-density EMG 
85 
(HDEMG) systems provide more reliable estimates of signal amplitude without the need for 
86 
normalization (14, 34). This is possible due to the large number of observation sites (tens of 
87 
electrodes) over the muscle belly that compensate for the variability of EMG with electrode 
88 
location. However, the use of several electrodes does not solve the problem of comparing 
89 
between muscles and subjects.  
90 
In addition to the neural drive to the muscle, EMG amplitude estimates are influenced by 
91 
several other factors, such as muscle architecture, geometry, EMG crosstalk, and 
92 
subcutaneous tissue thickness (11). Although normalization could help to improve between-
93 
muscle amplitude estimates, it is still not known if such measures really reflect differences in 
94 
neural drive to the muscles. The direct way to access the neural drive to muscles is by motor 
95 
unit recordings. Recent research has shown the possibility to identify large populations of 
96 
motor units non-invasively, with HDEMG (25, 27). However, even sampling relatively large 
97 
numbers of motor units, it is not possible to directly compare the strength of the neural drive 
98 
to different muscles since the decomposition cannot identify the entire pool of active motor 
99 
units. Rather, the number of decomposed motor units varies among muscles, with a weak 
100 
relation with the actual number of active units. For this reason, in this study we propose a 
101 
way to indirectly infer differences in neural drive between muscles by estimating the synaptic

 inputs received by their motor neuron pools. Assuming similar intrinsic properties of the 
103 
motor neurons between the muscles, we analyzed the increase in discharge rate from 
104 
recruitment to target torque for motor units matched by recruitment threshold in the two 
105 
muscles. Differences in the increase of discharge rate for motor units with the same 
106 
recruitment thresholds would indicate differences in synaptic input received by the 
107 
corresponding motor neurons and therefore differences in the generated neural drive to the 
108 
muscles. In addition, we estimated the amplitude of the individual motor unit action 
109 
potentials to examine the associations between interference EMG amplitude and either motor 
110 
unit action potential size or neural drive. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the 
111 
strengths of neural drives received by VM and VL muscles and investigate their relations 
112 
with EMG amplitude. We hypothesized that differences in EMG amplitude between VM and 
113 
VL muscles would be largely determined by the size of the motor unit action potentials 
114 
(MUAPs) rather than differences in neural drive to the two muscles, and that normalization 
115 
would not completely compensate for this influence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
118 
Participants 
119 
Eighteen healthy and physically active men (mean (SD) age: 29 (3) years, height: 178 (6) cm, 
120 
mass: 79 (9) kg) were recruited. None of the participants reported any history of 
121 
neuromuscular disorders or previous lower limb surgery. Subjects were asked to avoid any 
122 
strenuous activity 24 h prior to the measurements. The ethics committee of the Universität 
123 
Potsdam approved the study (approval number 26/2015), in accordance with the declaration 
124 
of Helsinki (2004). All participants gave written, informed consent. 
125 
Experimental protocol 
126 
The participants performed submaximal and maximal knee extension contractions on an 
127 
isokinetic dynamometer (CON-TREX MJ, PHYSIOMED, Regensdorf, Switzerland). The 
128 
isometric knee extensions were exerted with the knee flexed to 90°. After placement of the 
129 
surface EMG electrodes (see Data acquisition), subjects performed three maximal voluntary 
130 
contractions (MVC) of knee extension each over a period of 5 s. Each of these trials was 
131 
separated by 2 min of rest. The highest MVC value served as a reference to define the 
132 
submaximal torque levels. After 5 min of rest, and following  familiarization trials at low 
133 
torque levels (10 and 30% MVC), subjects performed submaximal isometric knee extension 
134 
contractions at 10, 30, 50 and 70% MVC in random order. Contractions at 10 and 30% MVC 
135 
were maintained for 20 s, while the contractions at 50 and 70% MVC were sustained for 15

 and 10 s respectively. In each trial, the participants received visual feedback of the torque 
137 
applied by the leg to the dynamometer, which was displayed as a trapezoid (5 s ramps with 
138 
hold-phase durations as specified above). Each contraction level was performed twice with a 
139 
rest of 2 min following each contraction.  
140 
Data Acquisition 
141 
The surface EMG signals of VM and VL were recorded in monopolar derivation with a two-
142 
dimensional adhesive grid (SPES Medica, Salerno, Italy) of 13 × 5 equally spaced electrodes 
143 
(1 mm diameter, inter-electrode distance of 8 mm). EMG signals were initially recorded 
144 
during a brief voluntary contraction during which a linear non-adhesive dry electrode array of 
145 
8 silver-bar electrodes (1-mm diameter, 5-mm length, 5 mm interelectrode distance; SA 8/5, 
146 
OT Bioelettronica, Torino, Italy) was moved over the skin to detect the location of the 
147 
innervation zone and tendon regions (23). After the skin was shaved and cleansed with 
148 
abrasion and water, the electrode cavities of the grids were filled with conductive paste 
149 
(SPES Medica, Salerno, Italy). Grids were positioned between the proximal and distal 
150 
tendons of the VM and VL muscles with the electrode columns (comprising 13 electrodes) 
151 
oriented along the muscle fibers. Therefore, the VM grid was positioned ~50º with respect to 
152 
a line between the anterior superior iliac spine and the medial side of the patella while the VL 
153 
grid was positioned ~30º with respect to a line between the anterior superior iliac spine and 
154 
the lateral side of the patella ((1, 22, 24, 25) (Figure 1). Reference electrodes were positioned 
155 
over the malleoli and patella of the dominant leg.  
156 
EMG and torque signals were sampled at 2048 Hz and converted to digital data by a 12-bit 
157 
analogue to digital converter (EMG-USB 2, 256-channel EMG amplifier, OT Bioelettronica, 
158 
Torino, Italy, 3dB, bandwidth 10-500 Hz). EMG signals were amplified by a factor of 2000, 
159 
1000, 500, 500 and 500 for the 10, 30, 50, 70 and 100% MVC contractions, respectively. 
160 
Data were analysed offline using Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA). 
161 
The 64-monopolar EMG channels were re-referenced offline to form 59 bipolar channels as 
162 
the differences between adjacent electrodes in the direction of the muscle fibers.  
163 
Signal analysis 
164 
Motor unit analysis. The EMG signals recorded during the submaximal isometric 
165 
contractions (from 10 to 70% MVC) were decomposed offline with a method that has 
166 
undergone extensive validation (28). The accuracy of the decomposition was tested with the 
167 
silhouette measure, which was set to ≥0.90 (28). The signals were decomposed throughout 
168 
the whole duration of the submaximal contractions and the discharge times of the identified 
169 
motor units were converted into binary spike trains. The mean discharge rate and discharge

 rate variability (coefficient of variation of the inter-spike-interval, CoVisi), were calculated 
171 
during the stable plateau torque region. Discharge rate at recruitment was calculated using the 
172 
first six discharges of the motor units (9). The motor unit recruitment threshold was defined 
173 
as the knee extension torque (%MVC) at the time when the motor unit began discharging 
174 
action potentials. Discharges that were separated from the next by <33.3 ms or >200 ms (30 
175 
and 5 Hz, respectively) were discarded from the mean discharge rate and CoVisi calculation 
176 
since such discharges are usually considered decomposition errors (24). Motor unit 
177 
conduction velocity (MUCV) was measured from a minimum of three to a maximum of nine 
178 
double-differential channels (manual selection) (25). Channels that had the clearest 
179 
propagation of MUAPs, with the highest amplitude in the columns of the grid and a 
180 
coefficient of correlation between channels ≥0.9, were selected for further analysis. Finally, 
181 
the amplitude of the MUAPs was calculated as the MUAP RMS averaged over all channels 
182 
of the grid (MURMS). VM and VL motor units were matched by their recruitment threshold 
183 
with a tolerance of ±0.5% MVC. The matched motor units were then grouped in four classes, 
184 
according to their recruitment thresholds ([0-10] % MVC, [10-30] % MVC, [30-50] % MVC, 
185 
[50-70] % MVC).  
186 
The discharge rate of motor units with the same recruitment thresholds (i.e., with a difference 
187 
in threshold <0.5% MVC) in the two muscles was used as a measure to compare the synaptic 
188 
inputs received by the pools of motor neurons. This measure corresponds to the increase in 
189 
discharge rate from recruitment to the target torque relative to the increase in torque from the 
190 
recruitment threshold [target torque (10, 30, 50 and 70% MVC) – recruitment threshold 
191 
torque]. A difference in the relative rate of increase in discharge rate between motor units in 
192 
the two muscles indicates differences in synaptic input received by the motor neuron pools of 
193 
the two muscles. It was then assumed that the neural drive to the muscles depended on the 
194 
synaptic input. 
195 
Interference EMG. The root mean square values (RMS) obtained from submaximal and 
196 
maximal contractions, were averaged over all channels of the electrode grid (22). During the 
197 
submaximal isometric contractions, the RMS was computed from the HDEMG signals in 
198 
intervals of 1 s. These values were extracted from the stable-torque region of the contractions 
199 
(e.g., hold-phase of 15 seconds at 50% MVC). RMSs of the maximal (MVC) contractions 
200 
were analyzed in a time window of 250 ms centered at the peak EMG activity (22). The 
201 
average conduction velocity (referred in the following as muscle fiber conduction velocity) 
202 
was calculated from the interference EMG in double differential derivations obtained along 
203 
the fiber direction (columns of the grid). In order to maximize the accuracy of muscle fiber

 conduction velocity estimates, three contiguous columns with four to six channels with the 
205 
highest cross-correlation in propagation were selected (10). Muscle fiber conduction velocity 
206 
estimation was obtained with a multichannel maximum-likelihood algorithm that was 
207 
previously shown to provide accurate estimates (standard deviation <0.1 ms) (13). 
208 
Amplitude normalization. Both absolute RMS and MURMS were normalized to the RMS 
209 
value obtained during the MVC in order to analyze the effects of normalization on 
210 
submaximal RMS amplitude of the interference EMG (absolute RMS) as well as on MURMS 
211 
between muscles.  
212 
 
213 
Statistical Analysis 
214 
The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check the normality of all variables. Sphericity was 
215 
checked by the Mauchley’s test and if violated, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was 
216 
applied to the degrees of freedom. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results are 
217 
expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD).  
218 
EMG (absolute RMS, normalized RMS and muscle fiber conduction velocity) and motor unit 
219 
variables (MURMS, discharge rate, CoVisi, motor unit conduction velocity and normalized 
220 
MURMS) were compared between muscles at each torque level with a two-way repeated 
221 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors muscle (VM and VL) and torque (10, 
222 
30, 50 and 70% MVC). When the repeated measures ANOVA was significant, pairwise 
223 
comparisons were performed with a Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc test. Linear 
224 
regression was used to characterize the association for each motor unit between the 
225 
differences in discharge rate at the target torque (mean discharge rate at 10, 30, 50 and 70% 
226 
MVC) and at recruitment (calculated from the first 6 motor unit discharges) and between the 
227 
target torque (10, 30, 50 and 70% MVC) and motor unit recruitment threshold. The slopes of 
228 
these linear regressions were compared between the two muscles by analysis of covariance 
229 
(ANCOVA) (35). The same analysis was applied to VM and VL MURMS vs. recruitment 
230 
threshold.  
231 
Finally, a multiple linear regression (stepwise) analysis was performed on EMG/motor unit 
232 
parameters to identify the variables that predicted the differences between VM and VL 
233 
absolute RMS. Therefore, the percent (%) difference in absolute RMS between VM and VL 
234 
was used as the predictor variable and the % differences in MU behavior/properties were 
235 
regarded as independent variables. Each torque level was analyzed independently (e.g. 
236 
absolute RMS % difference between VM and VL at 30% MVC was compared with motor 
237 
unit variables obtained at the same torque level). The partial eta-squared (ηp²) for ANOVA

 was used to examine the effect size of the differences between EMG and motor unit 
239 
parameters between muscles. A ηp² less than 0.06 was classified as “small”, 0.07-0.14 as 
240 
“moderate”, and greater than 0.14 as “large” (5). 
241 
 
242 
RESULTS 
243 
 
244 
Interference EMG 
245 
Absolute RMS (Figure 2a) was significantly greater for VM than VL at 30, 50 and 70% 
246 
MVC (interaction: muscle-torque, p<0.0001, ηp²=0.79). However, muscle fiber conduction 
247 
velocity (Figure 2b) was similar for the two muscles (interaction: muscle-torque, p=0.96, 
248 
ηp²=0.019). 
249 
 
250 
Decomposed motor unit populations 
251 
The average number of motor units accurately identified (with a SIL≥0.90) per subject at 
252 
each torque level was 8 (0.7) and 7 (1.2) in VM and VL, respectively. 
253 
According to their recruitment threshold, 340 motor units were matched between VM and 
254 
VL. Per subject, an average of 6.2 (3.0), 5.0 (2.5), 5.7 (2.8) and 3.3 (2.0) motor units were 
255 
matched between VM and VL at 10, 30, 50 and 70% MVC, respectively. The average 
256 
recruitment threshold of the matched motor units at 10, 30, 50 and 70% MVC was 7.5, 23.3, 
257 
38.2 and 56.2% MVC, respectively. Figure 3 shows the histograms of the number of matched 
258 
motor units according to their recruitment thresholds.  
259 
 
260 
Discharge rate and discharge rate variability 
261 
The mean motor unit discharge rate (at target torque) of VM was greater than for VL motor 
262 
units as revealed by a significant effect of muscle (p=0.009, ηp²=0.38) (Figure 4). However, 
263 
the regression lines of delta discharge rate [mean discharge rate at target torque – discharge 
264 
rate at recruitment] vs. delta torque [target torque – recruitment threshold] were not different 
265 
between muscles (slope of the regression lines, p>0.35, intercepts, p>0.08) at all target 
266 
torques (10, 30, 50 and 70% MVC) (Figure 5). Finally, there was no difference in discharge 
267 
rate variability between muscles as CoVisi (Figure 6) remained similar at all torque levels 
268 
(interaction: muscle-torque, p=0.4, ηp²=0.07).

 MURMS (Figure 7a) was significantly greater for VM than VL at 30, 50 and 70% MVC 
272 
(interaction: muscle-torque, p<0.0001, ηp²=0.57). Moreover, MURMS increased at a greater 
273 
rate with recruitment threshold for VM than for VL (p<0.0001, Figure 7b). Motor unit 
274 
conduction velocity (Figure 8) was significantly higher at 70% MVC for VM than VL

(interaction: muscle-torque, p=0.023, ηp²=0.46).

between muscles. Therefore, the difference (%) in VM-VL MURMS, discharge rate, and 
281 
motor unit conduction velocity were regarded as independent variables. Table 1 reports the 
282 
results of the multiple regression. At 10% MVC, only MURMS was entered in the model, 
283 
explaining 71% of the variance for the difference (%) in VM-VL absolute RMS. At 30%, 
284 
both MURMS and discharge rate entered in the model, however MURMS explained most of 
285 
the variance (53% MURMS vs. 13.2% for discharge rate). Similar results were obtained at 
286 
50% MVC where MURMS explained 72% of the difference between VM-VL absolute RMS, 
287 
with discharge rate only explaining 7.7% of the variance. Finally, at 70% MVC, only 
288 
MURMS was entered in the model, explaining 57% of the %difference in VM-VL absolute 
289 
RMS. 
290 
 
291 
Normalized amplitude 
292 
Normalized RMS (Figure 9) showed systematically higher values for VL across all torque 
293 
levels (effect: muscle, p=0.039, ηp²=0.23). Conversely, normalized MURMS did not show 
294 
any difference between muscles at any torque level (effect: muscle, p=0.46, ηp²=0.04, 
295 
interaction: torque-muscle, p=0.12, ηp²=0.11).

DISCUSSION 
298 
 
299 
This study shows that differences in EMG amplitude between synergistic muscles are mostly 
300 
explained by differences in MUAP size (MURMS), with little influence of other motor unit 
301 
properties. Moreover, EMG normalization does not provide clear explanation of differences 
302 
in muscle activation between the vasti. The observed differences in EMG amplitude between 
303 
muscles (in absolute values or normalized) contrasted with the similar neural drive estimated 
304 
for VM and VL. Taken together, the results suggest that EMG amplitude (in absolute values

 or normalized) should not be used to infer differences in neural drive between synergistic 
306 
muscles.   
307 
 
308 
Neural drive to VM and VL muscles  
309 
Due to current limitations in EMG decomposition, it is not possible to identify the full 
310 
populations of active motor units. For this reason, the neural drives cannot be directly 
311 
compared between muscles. We compensated for this limitation by an indirect assessment of 
312 
the strength of the neural drive. Matching synergistic muscles motor units by recruitment 
313 
threshold allows a direct comparison of motor unit discharge rates across muscles. Because 
314 
the discharge rate depends on the torque relative to the recruitment threshold, we focused on 
315 
the rate of change in discharge rate (mean discharge rate at target torque – discharge rate at 
316 
recruitment) with respect to the difference between exerted torque (10, 30, 50 or 70% MVC) 
317 
and recruitment threshold across the decomposed motor unit populations. This analysis 
318 
provides an estimate of the synaptic input received by the motor neuron pools of VM and VL, 
319 
since discharge rates indicate the nonlinear transformation of synaptic inputs into motor 
320 
neuron outputs (20). This approach indicated a similar change in motor unit discharge rate 
321 
with torque (figure 5) despite a difference in absolute discharge rates that can be due to the 
322 
random sampling of motor units in the two muscles (Figure 4). This suggests that the net 
323 
excitatory synaptic input to the pool of motor neurons of the vasti was similar. Assuming that 
324 
the intrinsic properties of the motor neuron pools in the two muscles were similar, this 
325 
observation was interpreted as reflecting similar drives from the motor neurons to the muscle 
326 
units. This conclusion is in agreement with a previous study that showed that VM and VL 
327 
share most of their synaptic input (21).  
328 
We also did not observe differences in discharge rate variability (CoVisi) between the two 
329 
muscles (Figure 6), in agreement with previous results (34). The present results show that, 
330 
despite a difference in mean absolute discharge rates between motor units of the VM and VL, 
331 
the two muscles did receive similar strengths of neural drives. Differences in VM and VL 
332 
surface EMG amplitude therefore do not reflect differences in the neural drive between the 
333 
vasti, as also confirmed by the multiple regression analysis.     
334 
  
335 
EMG amplitude and muscle fiber conduction velocity  
336 
Surface EMG amplitude is commonly used to infer the magnitude of the neural drive to 
337 
muscles. However, EMG amplitude depends on both motor unit behavior (recruitment, 
338 
discharge rate and discharge rate variability) and muscle fiber properties (MUAP size and

 conduction velocity) (11, 12). In this study, despite similar neural drives to the VM and VL, 
340 
the EMG amplitude for VM was significantly greater than for VL for torques in the range 
341 
30%-70% MVC (Figure 7). These results are consistent with other reports on absolute EMG 
342 
amplitude for these two muscles (15, 22, 34). EMG amplitude is influenced by muscle’s 
343 
geometry, architecture, crosstalk and subcutaneous tissue thickness (11, 29). Since the 
344 
observed differences in EMG amplitude between muscles did not correspond to differences in 
345 
neural drive, they are mainly explained by these anatomical factors, as confirmed by the 
346 
differences in MUAP sizes. Although previous research has reported similar subcutaneous 
347 
tissue thickness for the distal VM and VL (3), it has also been shown that the distal VM has a 
348 
larger cross sectional area and greater fascicle angle compared to the distal VL (2). Indeed, 
349 
recent research has shown that differences in muscle architecture can influence EMG 
350 
amplitude, even when the muscle is activated at a similar intensity (32). 
351 
Muscle fiber conduction velocity estimated from the interference EMG was similar between 
352 
the vasti, in agreement with previous studies (3). However, motor unit conduction velocity 
353 
differed between muscles. Muscle fiber conduction velocity is associated to fiber diameter 
354 
(16) but also depends on the level of muscle acidosis (30), temperature (8), muscle 
355 
fatigability (23), subcutaneous tissue thickness (33), exercise training (25, 33), discharge rate 
356 
(26). Because of these factors of influence, the relation between average and motor unit 
357 
muscle fiber conduction velocity is not exactly linear.  
358 
 
359 
EMG amplitude and MUAP size 
360 
As for absolute EMG amplitude, the size of MUAPs was significantly greater for VM in the 
361 
range of torques above or equal to 30% MVC. Moreover, MURMS increased at a faster rate 
362 
with recruitment threshold for VM than VL (Figure 7). This is consistent with a recent report 
363 
comparing VM and VL MUAP peak-to-peak amplitude (24). As for EMG amplitude, 
364 
MURMS is also influenced by muscle’s geometry, architecture and subcutaneous tissue 
365 
thickness (11, 29); therefore it is not surprising to find similar results for absolute RMS and 
366 
MURMS. Accordingly, results from the multiple linear regression (Table 1) showed that 
367 
most of the variance of the difference between absolute RMS of VM and VL was explained 
368 
by MURMS. This result directly indicates that that the neural drive has a relatively small 
369 
influence on EMG amplitude with respect to the MUAP waveforms.

 Since a vast number of studies apply normalization of the surface EMG prior to comparing 
373 
levels of muscle activations (4, 17), we analyzed the effect of normalization of both EMG 
374 
amplitude and MUAP size with respect to MVC. Even though normalization decreased the 
375 
VM/VL activation ratio and cancelled out the differences in MUAP size between muscles, 
376 
normalized EMG amplitude was greater for VL compared to VM that is contrary to the result 
377 
without normalization. This result does not correspond to the estimated similar neural drive to 
378 
the two muscles (figure 5) and explains the divergent results across studies on normalized 
379 
activations of the VM and VL in healthy subjects (31) and patients with musculoskeletal 
380 
disorders (e.g. patellofemoral pain syndrome) (18). Taken together, our findings suggest that 
381 
neither absolute nor normalized EMG amplitude (even when recorded from HDEMG 
382 
electrodes) are appropriate for inferring differences in neural drive between muscles.   
383 
 
384 
Conclusion 
385 
The difference in surface EMG amplitude between VM and VL muscles was mostly 
386 
explained by differences in MUAP size, with little effect of motor unit properties associated 
387 
to the neural drive to muscles. EMG amplitude is therefore mainly determined by peripheral 
388 
properties rather than by the neural activation. Normalization of the EMG compensates for 
389 
the differences in MUAP sizes but is still a poor determinant of neural activation.
