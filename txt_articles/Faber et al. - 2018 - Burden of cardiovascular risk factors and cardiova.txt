Aims
The cardiac and vascular late sequelae in long-term survivors of childhood cancer (CVSS)-study aimed to quantify
the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in German childhood cancer
survivors (CCS).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
In the CVSS-study (NCT02181049), 1002 CCS (age range 23–48 years) diagnosed with neoplasia prior to 15 years
of age between 1980 and 1990 prospectively underwent a systematic, standardized clinical and laboratory cardio-
vascular screening, identical to the population-based Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) cohort. For 951 individuals,
prevalences of CVRF and CVD were primarily compared to the GHS sample and to two further German
population-based cohorts. Using log-binomial regression models, an increased risk for occurrence of arterial hyper-
tension [relative risk (RR) 1.38, 95% confidence interval (95% CI 1.21–1.57)] and dyslipidaemia [RR 1.26 (95% CI
1.12–1.42)] was found. This indicates a premature occurrence compared to the general population of approxi-
mately 6 and 8 years, respectively [rate advancement period estimator, RAPhypertension 5.75 (95% CI 3.5–8.0) and
RAPdyslipidaemia 8.16 (95% CI 4.4–11.9)]. Overall, no differences were observed for obesity and diabetes. Overt
CVD was present in 4.5% (95% CI 3.0–6.6%) of CCS [RR 1.89 (95% CI 1.34–2.66), RAPCVD 7.9 (95% CI
4.1–11.7)], of which the most frequent entities were congestive heart failure and venous thromboembolism.
Prevalences of CVRF and CVD increased with age without reaching a plateau over time.

Conclusion
This large CCS screening examination revealed consistently in comparison to three population samples a consider-

Introduction
Since treatment of childhood cancer has improved significantly in the
last decades with an average overall survival above 80%,1 adverse late
effects among long-term childhood cancer survivors (CCS) have
become increasingly important. Currently, about 33 000 long-term
CCS are followed by the German Childhood Cancer Registry
(GCCR).1 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common non-
neoplastic cause of premature mortality in this population.2 Most
studies primarily obtained data with regard to cardiac or vascular tox-
icity, based on questionnaires, hospital admission data, or death certifi-
cates and frequently lacked a control cohort.2–8 Only few study
groups have directly assessed the comprehensive cardiovascular sta-
tus of CCS through clinical and laboratory examinations.9–11 Hence,
data from large-scale and highly standardized examination studies are
needed to extend valid evidence in this field and to help refining cur-
rent recommendations on management of cardiovascular toxicity in
CCS, as recently provided by the European Society of Cardiology.12,13
The cardiac and vascular late sequelae in long-term survivors of child-
hood cancer (CVSS)-study was designed to identify cardiovascular
risk factors (CVRF) as well as subclinical and clinical CVD by state-
of-the-art phenotyping in German CCS and to evaluate their associa-
tion with oncologic disease, cancer treatment, and genetics. Aiming to
quantify cardiovascular burden in CCS, prevalences of traditional
CVRF and CVD were analysed and compared to data from three
population-based samples.
Methods
Participants
German CCS were eligible for participation in the CVSS-study when diag-
nosed with a neoplasia according to the International Classification of
Childhood Cancer (ICCC3),14 prior to 15years of age, between 1980
and 1990, registered at the GCCR, survived more than 5 years after initial
cancer diagnosis and received antineoplastic treatment at one of 34
paediatric cancer centres participating in the CVSS-study. Survivors
of Hodgkin lymphoma and a small proportion of former nephroblastoma
patients (diagnosed in 1990) were not considered, since they were
included in other investigations.
Among 2894 invited CCS, 1002 individuals were examined between
October 2013 and February 2016 in the study centre at the University
Medical Center Mainz. The CVSS-study participants underwent a highly
standardized clinical evaluation over 5.5 h at the Gutenberg Health Study
(GHS)
cardiovascular
examination
platform15
(see
also
section
‘Population-based cohort samples’). All procedures performed in this
study were in accordance with the ethics standards of the institutional
research
committee
(approved
by
ethics
review
committee
of
Rhineland-Palatinate Chamber of Physicians) and with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent for study partici-
pation and treatment data retrieval.
Acquisition of medical data
Information on medical history was collected through a computer-
assisted personal interview (CAPI) and, if available, from medical records.
Cancer- and treatment-related data were abstracted either from primary
health records of former treating medical centres and/or the centrally
documented individual therapy data at the respective study centres of
the Society for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology (GPOH) and vali-
dated by trained medical staff.
Assessment of cardiovascular risk factors,
cardiovascular disease, and medication
The following CVRF were recorded: arterial hypertension (in the follow-
ing termed ‘hypertension’), dyslipidaemia, obesity, diabetes mellitus (in
the following termed diabetes), smoking, and positive family history for
myocardial infarction and/or stroke. The assessment of CVRF was per-
formed through a CAPI and clinical and laboratory examinations. The def-
inition of the CVRF is summarized in Supplementary material online,
Table S1.
The following data on CVD were assessed by a CAPI, when diagnosed
by a physician and, if possible, ascertained by medical records: congestive
heart failure (CHF) (requiring medication in the last 12months), coronary
heart disease including myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery
disease, atrial fibrillation, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) including
deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The participants’ cur-
rent drug intake was assessed by means of CAPI and evaluation of pro-
vided medication packages and categorized according to the Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical classification system of the World Health
Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology.
Population-based control cohorts
Prevalence of CVRF and CVD in the CVSS-study sample was compared
to the GHS population sample as cardiovascular data was obtained by
identical standardized examinations. The GHS is a population-based, pro-
spective, observational, single-centre cohort, including over 15000 par-
ticipants from the general population of Mainz and Mainz-Bingen, aiming
to evaluate and improve cardiovascular risk stratification.15 Additionally,
for harmonized and thus comparable variables, age-adapted study sam-
ples from two further German population-based cohort studies, the
German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS)
(2008–2011) and the Cooperative Health Research in the region of
Augsburg (KORA) (S4), were selected for comparison.16,17

Statistical analysis
Descriptive measures were calculated for demographic, clinical, and
treatment variables. Absolute and relative frequencies for CVRF and
CVD were computed according to ICCC3 diagnoses and sex. Indirect
standardizations were carried out to provide comparability in terms of
age and sex: data from samples of three population-based cohort studies
were weighted with age and sex distribution of the CVSS-study cohort.
For comparison with the GHS cohort, only the subsets with an overlap-
ping age range (35–48years) were analysed. Standardized prevalence
ratios (prevalence of the event in the CVSS/weighted prevalence of the
event in the comparison cohort) were calculated and non-parametric
bootstraps with replacement (n = 1000 random samples of the observed
data) were carried out to estimate 95% confidence limits.18 A log-
binomial regression approach was used to analyse the impact of ‘child-
hood-cancer’ (independent variable) on CVRF and CVD (dependent
variables) compared to the reference GHS cohort, which is appropriate
to model relative risk (RR) directly. Relative risks were presented with
95% confidence intervals (CI). The prevalence estimated by the regres-
sion model was plotted with the observed prevalence in 5-year age cate-
gories. The rate advancement period estimator (RAP) with the
asymptotic 95% CI was calculated to estimate the extent of prematurity
of CVRF/CVD in the CVSS sample.19,20 Statistical analyses were per-
formed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Software R
(Version 3.4.0, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).
Results
Among 1002 examined participants, 951 individuals were analysed, as
CCS with subsequent neoplasia (n = 51) were excluded. The CVSS-
study sample comprised 425 (44.7%) female and 526 (55.3%) male
participants with a mean age of 6.1 years (range 0–14) at initial child-
hood cancer diagnosis and 34.0 years (range 23–48) at follow-up,
respectively. Mean time from diagnosis to examination was 28.4 years
(range 23–36). More than half of the examined CVSS-study partici-
pants had been previously diagnosed with leukaemia or lymphoma
(53.4%,
n = 508).
Antineoplastic
treatment-related
data
were
obtained and validated for 91.9% (n = 874) of CVSS-study partici-
pants. The majority (91.1%, n = 796) had received either chemo- or
radiotherapy. Demographic, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics
of the CVSS-study sample are shown in Table 1. Demographic data
for the CVSS-study, GHS, DEGS, and KORA samples are presented
in Supplementary material online, Table S2.
Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors
The highest prevalences of CVRF within the CVSS-study sample
were identified for hypertension (23.0%) and dyslipidaemia (28.3%),
whereas a low frequency was recorded for diabetes (2.0%) (Table 2
and Supplementary material online, Table S3). Compared to GHS
participants, CVSS-study participants had an age-adjusted 38%
increase in risk for hypertension [RR 1.38 (95% CI 1.21–1.57)] and a
26% increase in risk for dyslipidaemia [RR 1.26 (95% CI 1.12–1.42)].
The calculation of RAP indicated that in CVSS-study participants,
hypertension and dyslipidaemia occurred approximately 6 years
[RAP 5.75 (95% CI 3.5–8.0)] and 8 years [RAP 8.16 (95% CI
4.4–11.9)] prior to GHS participants. We did not reveal any differ-
ence between the CVSS-study and the GHS population sample for
the prevalence of diabetes and obesity. Regression models estimated
for both, CVSS-study and GHS participants, a continuously increasing
probability to suffer from hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, and
diabetes with age, without reaching a plateau. Hence, 17.1% and
24.7% of the CVSS-study participants were estimated to have hyper-
tension and dyslipidaemia, respectively, by age 30years, increasing to
39.3% and 38.0% by age 45 (Figure 1). Relative risk estimates were
mainly confirmed by the standardized prevalence ratios, which were
derived from the age-adapted (35–48years) CVSS-study and GHS
sample (Table 3).
The CVSS-study sample contained the lowest proportion of smok-
ers of all four study cohorts. With regard to positive family history
for myocardial infarction/stroke, similar relative frequencies were
obtained in all comparable study samples with the exception of
KORA. Here, the prevalence was slightly lower in the CVSS-study

cohort. For hypertension and dyslipidaemia, the comparison with
DEGS confirmed the abovementioned findings. However, compared
to KORA prevalences for hypertension as wells as for obesity and
diabetes were higher in the CVSS-study sample (Table 4).
Within the CVSS-study, hypertension was highly prevalent in for-
mer patients with malignant bone tumours (42%, n = 21) and soft tis-
sue sarcomas (36.6%, n = 26). For dyslipidaemia, a markedly elevated
prevalence was observed in survivors of lymphoma (42.6%, n = 40).
For both, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, prevalence was consider-
ably increased for male CVSS-study participants compared to females
(Supplementary material online, Table S4).
Prevalence of cardiovascular disease and
medication intake
At least one of the CVDs was prevalent in 4.5% [(95% CI 3.0–6.6%),
n = 43] of CVSS-study participants. Of interest, 31 of 43 individuals
were below 40years of age. Congestive heart failure (1.2%; n = 11)
and VTE (2.0%; n = 19) accounted for 64% of all documented CVDs.
Coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and atrial
fibrillation were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.5%, and 0.4% of CVSS-
study participants, respectively (Table 2). All strokes occurred at least
19 years after diagnosis. According to age-adjusted regression esti-
mates, CVSS-study participants were nearly at a two times elevated
risk for CVD [RR 1.89 (95% CI 1.34–2.66)] compared to the GHS
cohort. On average, CVSS-study participants developed CVD
7.9years prior to the GHS sample [RAP 7.9 (95% CI 4.1–11.7)].
In terms of CHF, risk for the CVSS-study sample was estimated to be
nearly seven times higher [RR 6.76 (95% CI 2.73–16.72)] than for the
GHS cohort. As for the CVRF, probability of CVD and CHF
increased considerably with age for the CVSS-study as well as for the
GHS sample. In the CVSS-study cohort, probability to develop CVD
and CHF respectively was estimated as 2.9% and 0.8% by age of
30 years, increasing to 9.6% and 2.3% by age 45. No plateauing was
observed. Again, compared to GHS, RR for the CVSS-study cohort
to suffer from CVD and CHF was not changing with age (Figure 2).
For VTE, age-adjusted RR was calculated with 1.77 (95% CI
1.04–3.01). In comparison to DEGS, CVSS-study participants were
estimated to be approximately at a three-fold increased risk for CHF
[2.96 (95% CI 1.38–6.34)]. Relative risk was calculated with 2.42
(95% CI 1.13–5.19), when comparing to KORA (Figure 2).
Prevalence of CVD, CHF, and VTE tended to be higher in female
compared to male CVSS-study participants (Supplementary material
online, Table S4). With regard to ICCC3 diagnoses, we did not
observe any difference neither for CVD nor for CHF or VTE among
CVSS-study participants (Supplementary material online, Table S4).
Consumption of both, any and cardiovascular medication, was more
common among CVSS-study participants (69.3% and 11.0%, respec-
tively) than among the DEGS (56.5% and 5.9%, respectively) and
KORA (46.5% and 4.2%, respectively) cohorts (Table 2 and
Supplementary material online, Table S5). Similar results were
observed for the age-overlapping (35–48years) CVSS-study and
GHS cohort (data not shown).
Discussion
This is the first study to (i) evaluate comprehensively the cardio-
vascular health status of a large representative CCS cohort by
means of a systematic and standardized state-of-the-art pheno-
typing and to (ii) compare prevalences of traditional CVRF and of
CVD characteristics with those of the general population.
Contrasting with most of the previous studies, the comparison
sample was derived from a population-based study (GHS) and
underwent identical cardiovascular examinations in the same
study centre. To enhance the validity of our results, harmonized
variables were compared to samples from two additional
population-based cohorts (DEGS and KORA).
We identified a large proportion of CCS with hypertension
(23.0%) and dyslipidaemia (28.3%), which was considerably higher
than in the general population. Most of the previous large-scale stud-
ies in CCS assessed questionnaire-based data on both outcomes,
resulting in considerably lower prevalences.21,22 However, recent

studies

our
findings.10,11,23
Mulrooney et al. measured hypertension in 23.3% and dyslipidaemia
in 61.9% of a large CCS cohort (n = 1853) but did not compare data

hypertension, but not for dyslipidaemia, were recently compared to
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
estimating similar RR.23 Thus, to date, the present effort with a total
of approximately 14 500 individuals is the largest to provide evidence
for a substantially increased prevalence for hypertension and dys-
lipidaemia in CCS. In this study, survivors of soft tissue sarcoma
and malignant bone tumours tended to be at higher risk for hyper-
tension, which is probably attributable to the intensive antineo-
plastic treatment in these cancer entities. Cancer and its
treatment, particularly cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and
cardiac directed irradiation, are well recognized to play a major
role in the development of CVD.10,24 Traditional CVRF like
hypertension, are assumed to potentiate therapy-associated risk
for major cardiac events.21
As the analyses primarily aimed to quantify differences in cardio-
vascular risk between CCS and population samples by assessing the
risk factor profile, data were adjusted for the non-modifiable factor
age. Since the role of age for present CVD in CCS is ambigu-
ous,5,7,21,23,25 but age is well recognized to relate with CVD preva-
lence in the general population,26 its impact on cardiovascular
morbidity was compared between CCS and general population. The
data suggest that CVRF and CVD occur prematurely in CCS, and the
burden increases markedly with age without reaching a plateau.
Notably, the difference in risk compared to the general population
seemed not to alter with age. However, most published data indicate
an increase of RR for cardiovascular outcome with age, whereas
Gudmundsdottir et al.7 conversely revealed a substantial reduction of
RR for CVD with increasing age in a large Nordic survivor
cohort.21,23,25 Longitudinal observations over time period are needed
to further investigate this issue. We did not find difference for the
prevalence of diabetes and obesity between the CVSS-study and the
GHS sample. Yet, in comparison with KORA, CVSS-study partici-
pants were at elevated risk for both. These inconsistent findings might
be explained by regional differences in CVRF prevalence or slightly
varying study design and methodology.28 Research data are congru-
ent regarding obesity, defined by body mass index and implicate no
difference in prevalence between CCS and controls,4,22,27 but incon-
sistent for diabetes.4,9,10,21,22 However, CCS may benefit from
enhanced clinical attention to both CVRF.
Although frequencies of cardiovascular conditions, particularly for
coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral artery
disease were rare, we found an almost two-fold elevated risk and a

premature onset of CVD in CCS, as reported in several retrospec-
tive large-scale studies.7–9,25,29 Tendency towards higher intake of
cardiovascular medication in the CCS cohort further highlights this
increased cardiovascular morbidity. In CVSS, CHF and VTE
accounted for the majority of CVD, occurring with a considerably
elevated risk compared to the general population. Since there is little
published data on VTE, this study enhances attention to an important
and potentially underestimated cardiovascular condition.6,7 Although
numerous large-scale studies on CHF support our findings,3,5,6,21
recent echocardiographic data indicated a considerably higher fre-
quency of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction compared to the earlier
reported prevalence in CCS. Elevated burden of hypertension and
dyslipidaemia in CVSS-study participants at comparably young age is
also strongly predictive for future high cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality, as known from the general population.26
Limitations
Despite of the unique design of this study, several limitations must be
addressed, which support an underestimation of CVD burden:
Reported, but not measured CVD in the investigation is potentially
subject to non-differential misclassification, although this applies to all
cohorts. Assessment of CVD was restricted to the most common
cardiovascular conditions, not including valvular and pericardial dis-
ease as well as conduction disorders. A survival bias is introduced by
not considering individuals who died before examination. Two
tumour entities well known to predispose for CVD, especially after
irradiation,7,24,25 were not included (Hodgkin lymphoma survivors)
or likely under-represented due to potential disability or severe dis-
ease (survivors of central nervous system tumours). In all cohorts,
healthy individuals and those with severe cardiovascular conditions
might be under-represented.

Future directions
Future research on subclinical CVD (e.g. defined as asymptomatic
organ damage30) may help to better assess the risk for clinically overt
disease and to initiate preventive care. Early focused cardiovascular
screening including measurements of blood pressure and lipid pro-
files should be offered to CCS and not only to high risk subgroups as
recommended by current guidelines.31,32
Further clinical investigations on CVD in CCS should evaluate
(epi-)genetic, proteomic and imaging biomarkers to elucidate patho-
mechanisms of CVD and to clarify the role of premature aging, since
recent data indicate accelerated cellular aging in CCS.33 This may
finally help to develop risk adapted cancer treatment and individual-
ized cardiovascular follow-up care in the sense of precision medicine.
Conclusion
We found a substantially elevated burden of traditional CVRF and
CVD in a large German CCS cohort compared to the general popu-
lation. Cardiovascular disease occurs prematurely and increases with
age without reaching a plateau over time. The considerably increased
prevalence for hypertension and dyslipidaemia in this young adult
CCS indicates a high burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortal-
ity in the long term.
