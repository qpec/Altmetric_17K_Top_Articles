A live-attenuated malaria vaccine, Plasmodium falciparum sporo-
zoite vaccine (PfSPZ Vaccine), confers sterile protection against
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with Plasmodium falci-
parum (Pf) parasites homologous to the vaccine strain up to 14 mo
after final vaccination. No injectable malaria vaccine has demon-
strated long-term protection against CHMI using Pf parasites het-
erologous to the vaccine strain. Here, we conducted an open-label
trial with PfSPZ Vaccine at a dose of 9.0 × 105 PfSPZ administered i.v.
three times at 8-wk intervals to 15 malaria-naive adults. After CHMI
with homologous Pf parasites 19 wk after final immunization, nine
(64%) of 14 (95% CI, 35–87%) vaccinated volunteers remained with-
out parasitemia compared with none of six nonvaccinated controls
(P = 0.012). Of the nine nonparasitemic subjects, six underwent re-
peat CHMI with heterologous Pf7G8 parasites 33 wk after final im-
munization. Five (83%) of six (95% CI, 36–99%) remained without
parasitemia compared with none of six nonvaccinated controls.
PfSPZ-specific T-cell and antibody responses were detected in all
vaccine recipients. Cytokine production by T cells from vaccinated
subjects after in vitro stimulation with homologous (NF54) or het-
erologous (7G8) PfSPZ were highly correlated. Interestingly, PfSPZ-
specific T-cell responses in the blood peaked after the first immuni-
zation and were not enhanced by subsequent immunizations.
Collectively, these data suggest durable protection against homologous
and heterologous Pf parasites can be achieved with PfSPZ Vaccine.
Ongoing studies will determine whether protective efficacy can be
enhanced by additional alterations in the vaccine dose and number
of immunizations.

M
alaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is a major
cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in children in
sub-Saharan Africa (1, 2). Travelers, military personnel, and
international health care workers are also at risk (3, 4). The ideal
vaccine would confer on individuals high-level, sterile protection
against infection with Pf and would facilitate elimination efforts
by interrupting parasite transmission (5, 6).
The most extensively studied candidate malaria vaccine, RTS,S/
AS01, is composed of a truncated form of the main sporozoite
(SPZ) surface protein (circumsporozoite protein, PfCSP), and an
immune adjuvant (AS01). To our knowledge, this vaccine has never
been tested using controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with
a heterologous Pf strain of parasites. However, a phase 3 efficacy
trial in Africa using a four-dose regimen on a 0-, 1-, 2-, and 20-mo
schedule showed a 26% and 36% reduction in clinical malaria
among 6–12-wk-olds and 5–17-mo-olds, respectively, through 3–4 y
of follow-up (7). Therefore, alternative vaccine approaches are
needed that confer durable and sterile protection against homolo-
gous and heterologous strains.
In contrast to recombinant subunit vaccine approaches, at-
tenuated PfSPZ immunization consistently achieves high-level
(>80%) sterile protection against CHMI with homologous Pf
parasites (8–11). In addition, short-term protection (<8 wk)
against a heterologous CHMI with the Pf7G8 clone was dem-
onstrated in five subjects after exposure to >1,000 irradiated
PfSPZ-infected
mosquitoes
(10,

Significance
A highly effective malaria vaccine capable of long-term pro-
tection against genetically diverse strains is urgently needed.
Here, we demonstrate that a three-dose regimen of a live at-
tenuated whole-parasite malaria vaccine conferred durable
sterile protection through 33 weeks in ∼50% of subjects against
a controlled human malaria infection strain that is heterologous
to the vaccine strain. Prior studies by others and us have shown
that T cells are critical to mediating sterile protection after live-
attenuated malaria vaccination. Here, we provide evidence that
this Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ Vaccine)
induces antigen-specific IFN-γ-producing CD8 and CD4 T cells that
recognize both the homologous and the heterologous Pf strain.

 durable sterile protection against heterologous CHMI has not
been achieved with any injectable malaria vaccine (10, 13).
Results
Study Design. We recently showed that four i.v. immunizations
with PfSPZ Vaccine at a dose of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ conferred
∼55% sterile protection after homologous CHMI up to 14 mo
after the final immunization (14). On the basis of the favorable
safety profile and dose-dependent durable efficacy against ho-
mologous CHMI (11, 14), we continued PfSPZ Vaccine dose
escalation to 9.0 × 105 PfSPZ per dose. A three-dose regimen at
8-wk intervals was selected on the basis of data showing that an
8-wk interval between immunizations resulted in enhanced im-
munogenicity in nonhuman primates (11).
Study Population. Thirty-one volunteers were enrolled: 15 vaccine
recipients, 12 CHMI controls, and four back-up controls (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S1). Baseline demographic characteristics are shown in
SI Appendix, Table S1. Fifteen volunteers (100%) completed all
three scheduled vaccinations. Fourteen volunteers underwent
CHMI with homologous Pf parasites; one vaccine recipient
withdrew before CHMI to attend medical school.
Vaccine Safety. Vaccinations were well tolerated. Solicited local
and systemic adverse events (AEs) were generally graded as none or
mild (SI Appendix, Table S2). After the third immunization, one
subject had a temperature of 39.3 °C (graded as severe), which
coincided with an acute viral illness. All unsolicited AEs reported
during the vaccination period were classified as unrelated to the
vaccine. Alanine aminotransferase levels measured 14 d after vac-
cination were not elevated in any vaccine recipient (SI Appendix,
Fig. S2). There were no serious AEs attributed to vaccination.
Vaccine Efficacy, Homologous CHMI. Vaccine efficacy was first
assessed by CHMI with the Pf clone 3D7 by mosquito bite 19 wk
after final immunization. The vaccine is composed of the NF54
strain, which is likely of African origin (15). 3D7 is a clone from
the NF54 strain, and thus is homologous to the vaccine (16). 3D7
has been used to evaluate efficacy in the majority of malaria
vaccine trials using CHMI (10, 17–21). Nine (64%) of 14 vaccine
recipients (95% CI, 35–87%) and none of the six nonvaccinated
controls remained without parasitemia after homologous CHMI
(P = 0.012) (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Table S3). In the five
vaccinated volunteers who became parasitemic, the time to first
positive malaria PCR ranged from 13 to 15 d compared with 9 to
12 d for the controls (P < 0.0001, controls vs. all vaccine recip-
ients by log-rank; SI Appendix, Table S4).
Vaccine Efficacy, Heterologous CHMI. To assess the durability of
vaccine efficacy against heterologous CHMI, six of the nine
vaccinated subjects who were not parasitemic after homologous
CHMI underwent CHMI by the bite of mosquitoes infected with
7G8, a clone of Brazilian origin (22), ∼33 wk after final vacci-
nation. Five (83%) of six vaccine recipients (95% CI, 36–99%)
and none of the six nonvaccinated controls remained without
parasitemia after heterologous CHMI (Fig. 1B). Microsatellite
analysis of blood-stage parasites from vaccinated and non-
vaccinated individuals confirmed that the parasites detected af-
ter heterologous CHMI were genetically distinct from the 3D7
reference clone (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Antibody Responses. Antibody responses against PfCSP after im-
munization with PfSPZ Vaccine administered at lower doses
have been shown to be a sensitive measure of vaccine immuno-
genicity, have functional activity in vitro and in vivo, and may be
useful as an immune correlate of protection (14). After the first
vaccination, low-level PfCSP IgG responses were detected in 13/
14 subjects [Fig. 2A; geometric mean (GM), 213.5]. Such re-
sponses were substantially boosted ∼40-fold after the second
vaccination (14/14 subjects with PfCSP responses; GM, 9,336),
with modest boosting after the third vaccination (GM, 13,066).
There was a trend toward higher antibody responses among
subjects who remained without parasitemia after homologous
CHMI [GM, 15,858 (not parasitemic) vs. 8,717 (parasitemic)]. This
comparison did not reach the threshold for statistical significance
(P = 0.23) with this sample size (nine not parasitemic vs. five par-
asitemic). We also measured antibody responses against whole
PfSPZ by the automated immunofluorescence assay and showed
that they were highly concordant with PfCSP antibody levels
(Spearman’s r = 0.8787; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Tables
S5 and S6). Finally, we measured the ability of serum to inhibit SPZ
invasion of hepatocytes in vitro as a functional assessment of anti-
bodies. Inhibitory activity increased significantly after the three
immunizations compared with the preimmunization serum (P =
0.0012; SI Appendix, Fig. S4). These data showed that at doses of
9.0 × 105 PfSPZ, malaria-specific antibody responses were in-
duced in all subjects, but did not easily discriminate between
protected and unprotected subjects (SI Appendix, Table S7).
CD8 and CD4 T-Cell Responses. CD8 T cells are the primary cellular
effectors that are critical for mediating protection after whole-
SPZ vaccination in mice and nonhuman primates (23–25). Here,
after PfSPZ vaccination, the frequency of PfSPZ-specific cyto-
kine (IFN-γ, IL-2, or TNF-α) producing memory CD8 T-cell
responses peaked after the first immunization [0.38 ± 0.12%
(mean ± SEM); P = 0.002 compared with prevaccine; Fig. 2C], as
assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) after in vitro
stimulation with PfSPZ. Of note, IFN-γ+ CD8 T-cell responses
declined markedly after the second immunization and were not
different from prevaccine (background) levels 2 wk after the
third immunization (P = 0.12). The frequency of cytokine-pro-
ducing PfSPZ-specific memory CD4 T cells also peaked after the
first immunization [1.55 ± 0.38% (mean ± SEM); Fig. 2D]. Such
responses declined to 0.59 ± 0.08% and 0.51 ± 0.07% after the
second and third immunizations, respectively. CD8 T-cell re-
sponses were detected in 11/14 volunteers, and CD4 T-cell re-
sponses were detected in 14/14 volunteers. The magnitude of the
total PfSPZ-specific memory T-cell cytokine responses did not
significantly differ among vaccinated subjects who did or did not
develop parasitemia after homologous CHMI at the assessed
points (SI Appendix, Table S7).

 Fig. 2G), suggesting the ICS assay used to assess the frequency of
PfSPZ-specific T-cell responses after in vitro stimulation with
PfSPZ accurately reflects the absolute magnitude of in vivo CD4
T-cell activation by the first PfSPZ vaccination. Interestingly, al-
though circulating PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells were detected at
>0.5% by in vitro PfSPZ stimulation after the second and third
vaccination, the frequency of HLA-DR+CD38+ memory CD4
T cells 2 wk after second and third immunizations were only 0.17 ±
0.15 percentage points (mean ± SEM) and 0.25 ± 0.18 percentage
points, respectively, above the prevaccination frequencies. These
findings indicate that the second and third vaccinations resulted in a
dramatic reduction in in vivo activation of circulating PfSPZ-specific
CD4 T cells compared with the first vaccination.
γδ T-Cell Responses. Prior studies have shown that γδ T cells ex-
pand after immunization with PfSPZ Vaccine, and the frequency
of the Vδ2+ subfamily of γδ T cells is a potential immune correlate
of protection (11, 14). Here, we extend these findings and show that
γδ T cells have a high level of in vivo activation after vaccination, as
measured by HLA-DR+CD38+ coexpression (Fig. 3A). Activation
peaked at a mean of 34% (compared with 6.4% at prevaccination)
2 wk after second immunization (Fig. 3B). The frequency of circu-
lating Vδ2+ T cells increased after each vaccination (Fig. 3C). The
frequency was 2.8-fold higher than prevaccination, and this increase
persisted through follow-up (2.5-fold increase at the time of CHMI
with 3D7).
T-Cell Responses Against 7G8. Because we observed protection
against homologous and heterologous CHMI in subjects that
received only the homologous NF54 vaccine strain, we assessed
the PfSPZ-specific T-cell cytokine producing responses against
the heterologous 7G8 strain and compared them with responses
against the homologous NF54 vaccine strain. There was a sig-
nificant correlation in the magnitude of CD8 T-cell cytokine
responses to NF54 and 7G8 PfSPZ (Spearman r = 0.8052; P =
0.0005; Fig. 4A) 2 wk after the first immunization, when such
responses were measurable at detectable frequencies. CD8 T-cell
responses were also assessed by expression of the TNF-receptor
superfamily member 4-1BB (a marker of T-cell activation also known
as CD137). This marker has been used to identify antigen-specific
CD8 T cells after ex vivo antigen stimulation (28). Using this alter-
native assessment, CD8 T-cell responses were also highly correlated
(Spearman’s r = 0.9033; P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B). CD4 T-cell cytokine
responses were significantly correlated between the two strains
(Fig. 4C). Finally, γδ T-cell activation by the two strains (as
measured by 4-1BB) was also highly correlated (Fig. 4D). Ex-
pression of 4-1BB in the γδ T-cell compartment in response to
PfSPZ was evident in the prevaccine sample, as expected, as this
lineage of cells is prevalent before vaccination, albeit at lower
absolute frequencies than found after vaccination.
Discussion
The data presented here show that PfSPZ Vaccine administered
three times at a dose of 9.0 × 105 PfSPZ was safe and immu-
nogenic. The finding that nine (64%) of 14 volunteers remained
without parasitemia on homologous CHMI at 19 wk after final
vaccination with a three-dose regimen is higher than that pre-
viously achieved by four or five doses of 1.35 × 105 or 2.7 × 105
PfSPZ and further demonstrates the dose-dependent efficacy of
PfSPZ Vaccine (11, 14, 29). The results after heterologous
CHMI 33 wk after final immunization provide the first evidence
that durable protection can be induced against heterologous
CHMI with an injectable malaria vaccine. These data support
our hypothesis that higher PfSPZ Vaccine doses are required for
durable heterologous protection than are required for durable
homologous protection (14, 29).
We assessed heterologous efficacy after homologous CHMI in
subjects that were previously protected. Such sequential CHMIs
have been used in the majority of studies to assess durable vac-
cine efficacy (9, 13, 14, 19, 20, 29). In terms of whether a CHMI
may influence immunity, we have previously demonstrated that
there is no measurable boosting of PfSPZ-specific T-cell or anti-
body responses after homologous CHMI in protected subjects (14).
In addition, in our recent report, the estimated vaccine efficacy
against homologous CHMI at 5 mo was 55% in subjects who un-
derwent sequential CHMI at 3 wk and 5 mo, which was the same as
those who had their first CHMI at 5 mo (14). Collectively, these
data suggest that the single homologous CHMI did not likely in-
fluence immunity or protection against heterologous CHMI.

PfSPZ Vaccine approaches in CHMI studies suggest several
critical differences in the immune responses induced by attenu-
ated PfSPZ compared with subunit protein or viral vector vaccines.
PfSPZ Vaccine primes antigenically diverse T-cell responses (11)
and strain-transcending CD8 and CD4 T cells (Fig. 4). In addition,
PfSPZ Vaccine expands γδ T cells, which are not induced by
current subunit malaria vaccines. γδ T cells recognize an invariant
antigen from intracellular PfSPZ (phosphoantigens) (11, 14, 30).
Together, these characteristics of both antigenic and effector cell
breadth may help limit vaccine escape mutants that may reduce
protective efficacy of vaccines where immune responses are di-
rected against a single protein (31).
Pf-specific T-cell responses were induced in all vaccinated
volunteers and were significantly higher than we previously
reported, with lower doses of PfSPZ Vaccine (11, 14). CD8 and
CD4 T-cell responses in the blood were highest after the first
immunization, with limited boosting after the second and third
immunizations. The goal of PfSPZ Vaccine administration is to
induce immunity that interferes with the development of natu-
rally transmitted Pf sporozoites. Therefore, rapid induction of
anti-PfSPZ immunity may limit boosting by subsequent admin-
istrations of PfSPZ Vaccine, especially at the higher vaccine
doses used here compared with prior studies. Indeed, limited
boosting after irradiated SPZ vaccination has been demonstrated
in mouse models (32, 33). These data raise the question of whether
equivalent protective efficacy may be possible with fewer than
three immunizations, especially with higher doses of the vaccine.
Another possibility is that the second and third vaccinations were
expanding nonrecirculating liver-resident CD8 T cells (14, 34).
The frequency of PfSPZ-specific cytokine-producing CD8 and
CD4 T-cell responses were not different between subjects who were
not parasitemic and parasitemic at the peak after vaccination or be-
fore the homologous CHMI. The lack of a significant correlation may
be a result of the small sample size studied here. Furthermore, pro-
tection may be mediated primarily by nonrecirculating liver-resident
T cells that cannot be directly measured in the blood (14, 35).
This study was performed in malaria-naive US adults repre-
sentative of travelers or military personnel who would benefit
from a highly protective vaccine. Important considerations for
successfully using this vaccine in Africa and other endemic areas
include how preexisting malaria exposure, age, and baseline health
status influence immunogenicity and protection. Future studies
using additional heterologous CHMI strains in conjunction with
field studies against natural exposure will further establish the
breadth of protective efficacy conferred by PfSPZ Vaccine.
The findings reported here suggest that sterile protection
against homologous and heterologous CHMI can be achieved in
malaria-naive adults by a three-dose regimen of PfSPZ Vaccine.
On the basis of the favorable safety profile of the doses tested to
date and the immune data reported here, further dose increases
as well as fewer immunizations will be tested to determine
whether higher protective efficacy can be achieved, which will be
necessary for travelers and for mass vaccination strategies aimed
at interrupting transmission in endemic regions.
Materials and Methods
Study Design. VRC 314 was an open-label, dose-escalation trial with CHMI to
assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine (34,
36). The Vaccine Research Center Clinical Trials Core at the NIH Clinical
Center and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, developed the protocol
and conducted the clinical trial. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT02015091). Briefly, malaria-naive, healthy adults 18–45 y of age were
enrolled after obtaining written informed consent. Results of the initial
dose-escalation phase were reported previously (14). On the basis of the
favorable safety profile and data consistent with dose-dependent efficacy,
an amendment to the protocol was made, and an additional group of vol-
unteers was enrolled to receive 9.0 × 105 PfSPZ three times at 8-wk intervals.
The vaccine developer and investigational new drug (IND) application
sponsor, Sanaria Inc., participated in protocol design.
Study Oversight and Safety Surveillance. VRC 314 was approved by the Intra-
mural Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Allergy and In-
fectious Diseases and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, operated under a
Reliance Agreement with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Each step was reviewed and approved by a Safety Monitoring Committee.
Intravenous site and systemic reactogenicity parameters were recorded through
3 d after vaccination as solicited AEs. Unsolicited AEs were recorded until day 28
post-CHMI. Serious AEs and new chronic medical conditions were recorded
through 24 wk after the last vaccination. AEs were graded using a table adapted
from US Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry (37). Malaria-
associated symptoms and signs after CHMI were not included in unsolicited AE
listings because Pf infection was recorded as a separate study endpoint.
Vaccine and Vaccination. Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine, composed of radiation-at-
tenuated PfSPZ of the NF54 strain, was manufactured as described (34, 36).
PfSPZ Vaccine was thawed and diluted in 1 mL PBS containing 1% human
serum albumin. The vaccine (1 mL) was administered by rapid injection
through an intravenous catheter.
CHMI. CHMI was by the bites of five PfSPZ-infected Anopheles stephensi
mosquitoes that met standard infectivity criteria (19, 34, 38–40). Volunteers
underwent CHMI with 3D7 an average of 19 wk (range, 17–20 wk; SI Ap-
pendix, Table S3) after final immunization. CHMI with 7G8 was performed
an average of 33 wk (range, 32–35 wk; SI Appendix, Table S3) after final
immunization. Volunteers were monitored as outpatients on days 7–18, 20,

 22, 24, and 28 after CHMI. PCR was performed at each visit to detect parasite
DNA in blood and was used for primary clinical diagnosis and treatment
using established methods (14). Treatment with combination atovaquone
(1,000 mg) and proguanil (400 mg) tablets by mouth daily for 3 d was ini-
tiated upon two positive PCR results. Volunteers were considered protected
if the PCRs were negative through day 28 post-CHMI.
PfSPZ-Specific Antibody Responses. Sera were assessed for antibodies against
recombinant PfCSP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and against
whole PfSPZ by automated immunofluorescence assay, as described (14). Sera
were evaluated for functional activity by the inhibition of sporozoite in-
vasion (ISI) assay (SI Appendix).
PfSPZ-Specific T-Cell Responses. PfSPZ-specific T-cell responses were analyzed
by flow cytometry on cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs). PfSPZ-specific T cells were identified by stimulating PBMCs with
attenuated PfSPZ or PfSPZ Vaccine diluent and assessing cytokine production
by ICS, as described (14) (SI Appendix, Tables S8 and S9).
Statistical Analysis. The primary analysis compared the results of the vaccine
group’s first CHMI with those of nonvaccinated controls who underwent CHMI
concurrently, and was based on a Fisher’s exact test, one-tailed. The threshold
for significance for this primary analysis was set to 0.01 in the protocol to ac-
count for analyzing results from multiple vaccine groups. These earlier groups,
which assessed lower vaccine doses and the intramuscular route of immuni-
zation, had completed primary follow-up before the design, screening, en-
rollment, or dosing of the present group. Results from the prior groups are
reported elsewhere (14). All other analyses were based on nonparametric tests:
log-rank test for delay in parasitemia, and Mann–Whitney U test, Wilcoxon’s
signed rank test, and Spearman’s rank correlation for immune responses, as
specified in the text.
Role of the Funding Source. The clinical study, T-cell analysis, and statistical
analysis were supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National
Institutes of Health. Sanaria Inc. provided the vaccine and 7G8-infected
mosquitoes without cost and performed the antibody assays. All authors had
full access to all the data in the study. R.A.S. had final responsibility for the
decision to submit for publication.
