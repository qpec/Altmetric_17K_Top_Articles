Great American Smokeout — 
November 16, 2017
The American Cancer Society’s Great American 
Smokeout is an annual event that encourages smokers to 
make a plan to quit smoking (1). The 42nd annual Great 
American Smokeout will be held on November 16, 2017.
In the more than 50 years since the Surgeon General’s 
first report on smoking and health, cigarette smoking 
among U.S. adults has been reduced by approximately 
half. Nonetheless, since 1964, the year of that first report, 
an estimated 20 million persons have died because of 
smoking. Smoking remains the leading preventable cause 
of disease, disability, and death in the United States (2).
About two out of three adult smokers want to quit smok-
ing cigarettes, and approximately half of smokers made a 
quit attempt in the preceding year (2). However, in 2016, 
more than one in seven U.S. adults were current cigarette 
smokers (3). Getting effective help through counseling and 
use of medications can increase the chances of quitting by 
as much as threefold (4).
Information and support for quitting smoking is available 
by telephone at 800-QUIT-NOW (800–784–8669). CDC’s 
Tips From Former Smokers campaign offers additional quit 
resources at https://www.cdc.gov/tips.

Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable dis-
ease and death in the United States (1). Despite declining 
cigarette smoking prevalence among U.S. adults, shifts in 
the tobacco product landscape have occurred in recent years 
(2,3). Previous estimates of tobacco product use among U.S. 
adults were obtained from the National Adult Tobacco Survey, 
which ended after the 2013–2014 cycle. This year, CDC 
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assessed the 
most recent national estimates of tobacco product use among 
adults aged ≥18 years using, for the first time, data from the 
2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an annual, 
nationally representative, in-person survey of the noninstitu-
tionalized U.S. civilian population. The 2015 NHIS adult core

questionnaire included 33,672 adults aged ≥18 years, reflecting 
a 55.2% response rate. Data were weighted to adjust for differ-
ences in selection probability and nonresponse, and to provide 
nationally representative estimates. In 2015, 20.1 % of U.S. 
adults currently (every day or some days) used any tobacco 
product, 17.6% used any combustible tobacco product, and 
3.9% used ≥2 tobacco products. By product, 15.1% of adults 
used cigarettes; 3.5% used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes); 
3.4% used cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars; 2.3% used 
smokeless tobacco; and 1.2% used regular pipes, water pipes, 
or hookahs.* Current use of any tobacco product was higher 
among males; persons aged <65 years; non-Hispanic American 
Indian/Alaska natives (AI/AN), whites, blacks, and persons of 
multiple races; persons living in the Midwest; persons with a 
General Educational Development (GED) certificate; persons 
with annual household income of <$35,000; persons who were 
single, never married, or not living with a partner or divorced, 
separated, or widowed; persons who were insured through 
Medicaid or uninsured; persons with a disability; and persons 
who identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB). Current use 
of any tobacco product was 47.2% among adults with serious 
psychological distress compared with 19.2% among those 
without serious psychological distress. Proven population-level 
interventions that focus on the diversity of tobacco product use 
* Because of phrasing of the question in the 2015 NHIS, it was not possible to 
distinguish between regular pipe use and water pipe or hookah use in this analysis.
are important to reducing tobacco-related disease and death 
in the United States (1).
Consistent with previous reports (2,3), current cigarette 
smokers were defined as persons who reported they had 
smoked ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime, and smoked 
either “every day” or “some days” at the time of survey. Current 
users of all other assessed tobacco products were defined as 
persons who reported use “every day” or “some days” at the 
time of survey. Prevalence estimates for current use of any 
current tobacco product, any combustible tobacco product 
(cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, filtered little cigars, pipes, water 
pipes, or hookahs), and use of two or more tobacco products 
were calculated. Estimates were assessed overall and by sex, 
age, race/ethnicity, U.S. Census region,† education, marital 
status, annual household income, sexual orientation,§ health 
† Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Midwest: Illinois, Indiana,

Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.
§ Sexual orientation was determined based on the question, “Which of the 
following best represents how you think of yourself?” with response options of 
“gay” (“lesbian or gay” for female respondents), “heterosexual,” that is, “not 
gay” (“not lesbian or gay” for female respondents), “bisexual,” “something else,” 
and “I don’t know the answer.” Responses were considered to be “LGB” if 
persons responded “gay,” “lesbian or gay,” or “bisexual.”

insurance coverage,¶ disability,** and presence of serious psy-
chological distress.†† Significant differences between groups 
were assessed using chi-squared statistics; differences presented 
were all statistically significant (p<0.05).
Among U.S. adults in 2015, 20.1% (an estimated 48.7 mil-
lion) currently used any tobacco product, 17.6% (42.6 million; 
87.4% of current tobacco product users) currently used any 
combustible tobacco product, and 3.9% (9.5 million; 19.5%) 
currently used ≥2 tobacco products. By product, 15.1% 
(36.5 million; 74.9% of current users) of adults currently used 
cigarettes; 3.5% (7.9 million; 16.1%) used e-cigarettes; 3.4% 
(7.8 million; 16.0%) used cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little 
cigars; 2.3% (5.1 million; 10.5%) used smokeless tobacco; and 
1.2% (2.7 million; 5.5%) used pipes, water pipes, or hookahs.
Differences in tobacco product use were observed across 
population groups (Table). The prevalence of any current 
tobacco use was significantly higher among males (25.2%) than 
among females (15.4%) and among adults aged 25–44 years 
(23.3%) than among those aged ≥65 years (11.1%). Notably, 
the age distribution of current tobacco users varied by product 
type, and for pipes, water pipes, hookahs and e-cigarettes, use 
was highest among younger adults (Figure). By race/ethnicity, 
current use was higher among non-Hispanic AI/AN (26.6%), 
 ¶ Private coverage: includes adults who had any comprehensive private insurance 
plan (including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider 
organizations). Medicaid: for adults aged <65 years, includes adults who do 
not have private coverage, but who have Medicaid or other state-sponsored 
health plans including Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); for 
adults aged ≥65 years, includes adults aged ≥65 years who do not have any 
private coverage but have Medicare and Medicaid or other state-sponsored 
health plans including CHIP; Medicare only: includes adults aged ≥65 years 
who only have Medicare coverage; Other coverage: includes adults who do 
not have private insurance, Medicaid, or other public coverage, but who have 
any type of military coverage, coverage from other government programs, or 
Medicare. Uninsured: includes adults who have not indicated that they are 
covered at the time of the interview under private health insurance, Medicare, 
Medicaid, CHIP
, a state-sponsored health plan, other government programs, 
or military coverage.
 
** Disability was defined based on self-reported presence of selected limitations 
including vision, hearing, cognition, and movement. Limitations in 
performing activities of daily living were defined based on response to the 
question, “Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing?” Limitations in 
performing instrumental activities of daily living were defined based on 
response to the question, “Because of a physical, mental, or emotional 
condition, does [person] have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting 
a doctor’s office or shopping?” Any disability was defined as a “yes” response 
pertaining to at least one of the limitations listed (i.e., vision, hearing, 
cognition, movement, activities of daily living, or instrumental activities of 
daily living). A random sample of half of the respondents from the 2015 
Person File were asked about limitations.
 
†† The Kessler psychological distress scale is a series of six questions that ask 
about feelings of sadness, nervousness, restlessness, worthlessness, and feeling 
like everything is an effort in the past 30 days. Participants were asked to 
respond on a Likert Scale ranging from “None of the time” (score = 0) to “All 
of the time” (score = 4). Responses were summed over the six questions; 
persons with a score of ≥13 were coded as having serious psychological distress, 
and respondents with a score <13 were coded as not having serious 
psychological distress.
multiple races (25.4%), whites (22.6%), and blacks (20.8%), 
and lowest among non-Hispanic Asians (9.0%). By region, 
prevalence was highest among adults living in the Midwest 
(24.0%) and lowest among those living in the West (17.4%). 
Prevalence was highest among adults with a GED certificate 
(37.6%) and lowest among those with a graduate degree 
(6.9%), and was higher among adults who were single, never 
married, or not living with a partner (23.1%) or divorced, 
separated, or widowed (23.2%) than among adults who were 
married or living with a partner (18.2%). Prevalence of tobacco 
use was highest among persons with an income of <$35,000 
(27.8%) and lowest among those with an annual household 
income of ≥$100,000 (13.4%); it was also higher among LGB 
adults (27.4%) than among heterosexual adults (20.1%), and 
among uninsured persons (32.3%) and Medicaid enrollees 
(31.7%) than among those covered by private health insurance 
(16.6%) or by Medicare only (11.4%). Adults with a disability 
had higher prevalence (25.8%) of tobacco use than did those 
reporting no disability (19.7%), and prevalence was higher 
among adults with serious psychological distress (47.2%) than 
adults without serious psychological distress (19.2%).
Discussion
In 2015, approximately one in five U.S. adults (48.7 million) 
currently used any tobacco product, with most using combus-
tible tobacco products. Any tobacco product use was significantly 
higher among males; adults aged <65 years; non-Hispanic AI/
AN, whites, blacks, and persons of multiple races; persons living 
in the Midwest; persons with a GED; persons with annual house-
hold income <$35,000; persons who were single/never married/
not living with a partner or divorced/separated/widowed; persons 
who were uninsured or insured through Medicaid; persons with 
a disability; and persons who identified as LGB. Adults with 
serious psychological distress had the highest prevalence of any 
tobacco product use of any subpopulation.
The burden of death and disease from tobacco use is over-
whelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted tobacco 
products (1). Cigarette smoking has been declining among 
U.S. adults for several decades (1); in more recent years, 
prevalence declined from 20.9% in 2005 to 15.1% in 2015 
(3). The findings from this report show that in 2015, cigarettes 
remained the most commonly used tobacco product among 
adults, and combustible tobacco products were currently used 
by 17.6% of adults, or 87.4% of current any tobacco users. 
Despite the popularity of emerging products such as pipes, 
water pipes, hookahs, and e-cigarettes among youths, these 
findings highlight the importance of also continuing to use 
targeted evidence-based, population-level strategies to combat 
combustible product use. These strategies include tobacco price 
increases, high-impact antitobacco mass media campaigns,

* Any tobacco use was defined as use either “every day” or “some days” of at least one tobacco product among individuals (for cigarettes, users were defined as 
persons who reported use either “every day” or “some days” and had smoked ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime).
 
† Any combustible tobacco use was defined as use either “every day” or “some days” of at least one combustible tobacco product: cigarettes; cigars, cigarillos, 
filtered little cigars; pipes, water pipes, or hookah (for cigarettes, users were defined as persons who reported use either “every day” or “some days” and had 
smoked ≥100 cigarette during their lifetime).
 
§ Current cigarette smokers were defined as persons who reported smoking ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime and now smoked cigarettes “every day” or “some days.”
 
¶ Reported smoking cigars, cigarillos, or little filtered cigars at least once during their lifetime and now smoked at least one of these products “every day” or “some days.”
 ** Reported smoking tobacco in a regular pipe, water pipe, or hookah at least once during their lifetime and now smoked at least one of these products “every day” 
or “some days.”

 §§§ Private coverage: includes adults who had any comprehensive private insurance plan (including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations). 
Medicaid: For adults aged <65 years, includes adults who do not have private coverage, but who have Medicaid or other state-sponsored health plans including Children’s 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP); for adults aged ≥65 years, includes adults aged ≥65 years who do not have any private coverage but have Medicare and Medicaid or 
other state-sponsored health plans including CHIP
. Medicare only: includes adults aged ≥65 years who only have Medicare coverage. Other coverage: includes adults who 
do not have private insurance, Medicaid, or other public coverage, but who have any type of military coverage, coverage from other government programs, or Medicare. 
Uninsured: includes adults who have not indicated that they are covered at the time of the interview under private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP
, a state-
sponsored health plan, other government programs, or military coverage. Insurance coverage is “as of time of survey.”
 ¶¶¶ Disability was defined based on self-reported presence of selected limitations including vision, hearing, cognition, and movement. Limitations in performing 
activities of daily living were defined based on response to the question, “Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing?” Limitations in performing instrumental 
activities of daily living were defined based on response to the question, “Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty 
doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?” Any disability was defined as a “yes” response pertaining to at least one of the limitations 
listed (i.e., vision, hearing, cognition, movement, activities of daily living, or instrumental activities of daily living). A random sample of half of the respondents 
from the 2015 Person File were asked about limitations.
 
**** The Kessler psychological distress scale is a series of six questions that ask about feelings of sadness, nervousness, restlessness, worthlessness, and feeling like 
everything is an effort in the past 30 days. Participants were asked to respond on a Likert Scale ranging from “None of the time” (score = 0) to “All of the time” 
(score = 4). Responses were summed over the six questions; persons with a score of ≥13 were coded as having serious psychological distress, and respondents 
with a score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress.

in the United States (1).
Observed disparities in tobacco product use across popu-
lation groups likely have multiple contributing factors. For 
example, disparities in tobacco use by race/ethnicity might be 
partly explained by socio-cultural influences, norms surround-
ing the acceptability of tobacco use, and targeted marketing 
(1,4). Differences by education might be partly attributable 
to variations in understanding of the range of health hazards 
caused by tobacco product use (1,4). Differences by health 
insurance coverage and income might be attributable in part to 
variations in tobacco cessation coverage across insurance types 
and access to evidence-based cessation treatments, respectively 
(1,5). Furthermore, the higher prevalence of current tobacco 
product use among persons who identified as LGB might be 
due, in part, to social stressors including stigma and discrimina-
tion, in addition to targeted marketing efforts by the tobacco 
industry (1,6). Similarly, the higher rates of pipe, water pipe, 
hookah, and e-cigarette use among younger adults could be due 
to the manner in which these products are marketed and used 
socially (1,7). The tobacco industry has targeted marketing

toward minority communities, persons of lower socioeconomic 
status, and younger persons (4,6). Lastly, the high prevalence 
of tobacco use among persons with serious psychological dis-
tress possibly reflects nicotine’s stimulant or relaxation effects, 
nicotine’s effects on drug metabolism, misperceptions about 
quitting smoking and abstinence success, and allowing smok-
ing in mental health facilities (4,8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, tobacco use estimates were self-reported 
and not validated by biochemical tests. However, previous 
studies have shown that self-reported tobacco product use is 
highly correlated with serum cotinine levels (9,10). Second, 
the NHIS response rate (55.2%) could introduce nonresponse 
bias if respondents and nonrespondents systematically differ 
in ways not accounted for in the development of the weights. 
Finally, NHIS does not include institutionalized populations 
and persons in the military, so the results are not generalizable 
to those groups.
Sustained, comprehensive state tobacco control programs can 
accelerate progress toward reducing tobacco-related diseases 
and deaths.§§ Full implementation of comprehensive tobacco 
control programs, in conjunction with FDA regulation of 
tobacco products, across the spectrum of tobacco products, 
are vital (1). Targeted interventions are also warranted to reach 
subpopulations with the greatest burden of use, which might 
vary by tobacco product type.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Tobacco use continues to be the leading cause of preventable 
disease and death in the United States. Despite declining 
cigarette smoking prevalence among U.S. adults, notable shifts 
in the tobacco product landscape have occurred in recent years.
What is added by this report?
In 2015, 20.1% of U.S. adults currently (every day or some days) 
used any tobacco product, 17.6% used any combustible 
tobacco product, and 3.9% used ≥2 tobacco products. Current 
use of any tobacco product was higher among males; persons 
aged <65 years; non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska natives, 
whites, blacks, and persons of multiple races; persons living in 
the Midwest; persons with a General Educational Development 
certificate; persons with annual household income <$35,000; 
persons who were single/never married/not living with a 
partner or divorced/separated/widowed; persons who were 
insured through Medicaid or uninsured; persons with a 
disability; and persons who identified as lesbian, gay, or 
bisexual. Current use of any tobacco product was 47.2% among 
adults with serious psychological distress compared with 19.2% 
among those without serious psychological distress.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Full implementation of comprehensive tobacco control 
programs, in conjunction with FDA regulation of tobacco 
products, are vital across the spectrum of tobacco products. 
Targeted interventions are also warranted to reach subpopula-
tions with the greatest burden of use, which might vary by 
tobacco product type.
