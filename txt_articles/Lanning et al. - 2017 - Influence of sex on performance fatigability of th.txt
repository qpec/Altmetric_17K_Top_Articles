ABSTRACT 
The purpose was to determine sex-differences in fatigability during maximal, unconstrained 
velocity, shortening plantar flexions.  The role of time-dependent measures (i.e., rate of torque 
development (RTD), rate of velocity development (RVD), rate of neuromuscular activation) in 
such sex-related differences was also examined.  By task termination, females exhibited less 
reductions in power and similar changes in rate of neuromuscular activation than males, 
indicating females were less fatigable than males.

INTRODUCTION 
 
During isometric tasks performed at the same relative intensity, females are more fatigue 
resistant than males, but this generalization depends on the intensity and muscle group (Hunter 
2016).  During dynamic tasks, however, the evidence is less clear as to whether females exhibit 
less fatigability than males, which is likely owing to an inadequate number of studies focusing on 
sex-related fatigability and dynamic tasks (Hunter 2016). 
Most studies focusing on isotonic-like tasks have focused on the elbow flexors and/or 
knee extensors (Maughan et al. 1986, Pincivero et al. 2004, Labarbera et al. 2013, Senefeld et al. 
2013, 2016, Yoon et al. 2015) and have reported less (Maughan et al. 1986, Labarbera et al. 
2013, Yoon et al. 2015) or similar (Maughan et al. 1986, Pincivero et al. 2004, Senefeld et al. 
2013, 2016) fatigability for females compared with males.  During controlled, slow velocity, low 
resistance contractions, females exhibited less fatigue than males (Labarbera et al. 2013; 
Maughan et al. 1986; Yoon et al. 2015), but as the load (Maughan et al. 1986) or angular velocity 
is increased (Senefeld et al. 2013) sex-related fatigability is similar.  However, when fatigability 
was characterized by a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) following maximal 
unconstrained velocity knee extensions, females were less fatigable than males (Senefeld et al. 
2013).  Thus, owing to differences in task intensity (i.e., load), muscle group, and criterion 
measure, a decisive conclusion on sex-based differences in fatigue is unclear. 
Maximal unconstrained velocity during isotonic contractions has become an informative 
parameter for characterization of the fatigue-related decrements in peak power for both young 
(Cheng and Rice 2005, Power et al. 2010, Senefeld et al. 2013) and older (Dalton et al. 2010, 
2012, 2015, Power et al. 2012, Senefeld et al. 2016) adults.  Time-dependent performance

measures (i.e., rate of neuromuscular activation, rate of torque development (RTD), and rate of 
velocity development (RVD)) may provide key factors that fundamentally determine peak 
velocity and dynamic contraction performance (i.e., peak power) (Andersen and Aagaard 2006, 
Wallace et al. 2016).  Following a fatiguing task, if there is indeed a sex-difference in power, 
these time-dependent measures may provide further insight into factors of sex-related 
performance fatigability.  
The purpose of the present study was to determine whether females are less fatigable than 
males following an unconstrained velocity, shortening plantar flexion task and whether time-
dependent neuromuscular factors (i.e., RTD, RVD, and rate of neuromuscular activation) can 
explain the sex-related differences in performance fatigability.  We hypothesized that following 
the fatiguing task, females would display less fatigue than males, as measured by less of a 
decrease in peak power, and fatigue-related changes in peak power will be related to RTD and 
RVD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Participants.  Nine females and eight males were recruited from the local university community.  
All participants were recreationally active (Table 1) and reported no lower limb neuromuscular 
or orthopedic disorders.  Participants granted written informed consent.  The procedures were 
approved by the University’s institutional review board and conformed to the Declaration of 
Helsinki. 
 
Experimental Arrangement.  Plantar flexion torque, ankle position and angular velocity were 
recorded in isometric and isotonic modes of a Biodex System 3 (Biodex Medical Systems Inc., 
Shirley, NY, USA).  Participants sat upright with the knee extended to 170° (full extension = 
180°), hip joint at 85°, and ankle in a neutral position (0° of plantar flexion) for the isometric and 
initial position for the isotonic contractions (Dalton et al. 2013, 2014).  The range of motion for 
the fatigue task was set from neutral to 25° of plantar flexion.  A custom-made binding and an 
inelastic strap over the dorsum and toes, respectively, secured the foot to the footplate. 
  
All contractions were performed with the right plantar flexors and the ankle joint aligned 
with the dynamometer’s axis of rotation.  Torque, angular velocity, and position were sampled at 
1000Hz (Power 1401-3, Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK) and stored using 
Spike2 software (v7, Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK). 
In accordance with a previous report (Wallace et al. 2016), surface electromyography 
(EMG) signals were collected from the soleus and medial gastrocnemius (MG) using pairs of 
self-adhering electrodes (M-00-S, Ambu BlueSensor M, Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) and a 
ground over the right patella.  Electromyogram signals were pre-amplified (×100), amplified

(×2), filtered (30-1000Hz), and sampled at 2000Hz (Power 1401-3, Cambridge Electronics 
Design, Cambridge, UK). 
 
Experimental Procedures.  Participants performed 3-4 ~7-s MVCs with 3 min rest between 
efforts.  An additional MVC was attempted if the first 3 MVCs varied in peak torque by more 
than 5%. 
Following 3 min of rest, participants were familiarized with the isotonic contractions by 
performing maximal plantar flexions through a 25° range of motion (foot was passively returned 
to starting position) with a set resistance equivalent to 30% MVC.  Participants attempted several 
contractions until a consistent peak angular velocity was achieved.  Then, participants performed 
five consecutive contractions to practice the fatigue task.  To ensure a maximal effort, each 
participant was instructed to plantar flex as quickly and forcefully as possible for all 
contractions, encouraged verbally, and given real-time visual feedback (Power et al. 2011). 
Following 3-min rest, participants performed the fatigue task of 200 maximal-effort, 
isotonic plantar flexions with a 30% MVC resistance.  Participants contracted upon the “go” 
prompt of the investigator for a consistent frequency of 1 contraction per ~1.5 s.  Participants 
attempted a final MVC ~10 s following task termination. 
 
Data and Statistical Analyses.  Spike2 software (version 7, Cambridge Electronics Design, 
Cambridge, UK) was used to analyze all data.  Torque and angular velocity channels were 
filtered digitally with a low-pass fourth-order digital filter at 40Hz.  The baseline MVC with the 
highest peak torque was chosen to represent MVC peak torque (Nm).  Peak power was 
calculated from the product of torque (Nm) and velocity (rad/s).  Dynamic voluntary RTD

(∆Torque/∆Time) and RVD (∆Velocity/∆Time) were calculated using the same parameters as 
reported previously (Wallace et al. 2016).  For rate of neuromuscular activation of the soleus 
(RAsol) and MG (RAmg), rate of EMG rise was calculated (Wallace et al. 2016).  Briefly, plantar 
flexor surface EMG was band-pass filtered digitally (4th Order Butterworth, 30-500Hz) and the 
root mean square (RMS) amplitude was derived over a 50 ms iterative moving average window.  
Next, the linear slope (∆RMS amplitude/∆Time) was determined using an iterative moving 
average window of 50 ms and the maximum value of the slope occurring between activation 
onset and prior to peak power was recorded for analysis.  For analysis of all data, we defined 
baseline (i.e., pre-fatigue) as the maximum value within the first 10 contractions of the fatigue 
task; whereas the post-fatigue value was the average of the last 10 contractions. 
Two-tailed, unpaired t-tests were used to compare baseline dependent variables between 
sexes.  Further, the percent change in each variable was calculated ([Baseline – Post]/Baseline) 
and compared between sexes with unpaired t-tests.  Significance was set at p < 0.05.  Effect sizes 
were calculated using Cohen’s d.  Linear regression analyses (r and R2) were conducted to 
determine the relationship between fatigue-related change in peak power and changes in torque 
and velocity at peak power, RTD, RVD, RAsol and RAmg.  Data are reported as means ± standard 
deviations.

RESULTS 
 
Baseline.  Although participants were matched for age and physical activity, the females were 
shorter, had less mass, exhibited lower MVC and dynamic torque, slower angular velocity and 
less peak power than males.  The females also displayed lower RTD, RVD, RAsol and RAmg than 
males (Table 1). 
 
Fatigue.  Immediately following task termination, the fatigue-related change in MVC torque was 
not different for females than males (p=0.38, d=0.47, females post: 139.1±30.1 Nm, males post: 
153.6±26.9 Nm).  The fatigue-related change in peak power was ~15% less for females 
compared with males (p=0.02, d=1.51, Figure 1B), while the change in torque at peak power was 
11% less (p=0.03, d=1.51) with a trend for a smaller change in angular velocity at peak power 
(p=0.08, d=1.38) for the females than males (Figure 1B).  However, by task termination, there 
were no differences between sexes for percent change in RTD (p=0.11, d=1.08), RVD (p=0.09, 
d=1.02), RAsol (p=0.75, d=0.20), or RAmg (p=0.68, d=0.18, Figure 1B). 
The fatigue-related change in peak power was positively and strongly correlated with a 
change in torque (r=0.96, R2=0.92, p<0.001) and angular velocity (r=0.91, R2=0.82, p<0.001), 
RVD (r=0.95, R2=0.90, p<0.001) and RTD (r=0.80, R2=0.63 p<0.001), but not RAsol (r=0.51, 
R2=0.26, p=0.45) nor RAmg (r=0.38, R2=0.14, p=0.15).

DISCUSSION 
 
The purpose of this study was to determine whether sex-related differences in 
performance fatigability of the plantar flexors exists following high-intensity shortening 
contractions.  The main findings indicate that females were less fatigable than males, which was 
supported by less fatigue-related decrements in peak power, and torque and angular velocity 
(p=0.08) at peak power for females than males (Figure 1B).  The fatigue-related change in peak 
power was positively correlated with torque, velocity, RVD and RTD, but not rate of activation.  
Our current results indicate sex-related differences in performance fatigability may be related to 
mechanisms underlying time-dependent parameters within the muscle, but likely not those 
related to neuromuscular activation. 
 
Although females were weaker, slower and exhibited lower rates of neuromuscular 
activation for the plantar flexors than males (Table 1), females were less fatigable, which is a 
different outcome than the limited number of reports on sex-related fatigue differences for 
maximal effort unconstrained shortening velocity tasks in other muscle groups (Senefeld et al. 
2013, 2016).  The differences may be owing to muscle fibre composition or activity patterns.  
Studies focusing on the elbow flexors and knee extensors suggest that both sexes demonstrate 
similar decrements in peak power (Senefeld et al. 2013, 2016).  Yoon et al. (2015) reported that 
females were less fatigable than males during slow-velocity (~60º/s), low-resistance (20% MVC) 
elbow flexions until task failure.  Besides differences in angular velocity, the latter study (Yoon 
et al. 2015) used a larger work-to-rest ratio (lifting and lowering resistance over every 3 s) than 
Senefeld et al. (2013, 2016), where subjects performed 90 maximal effort shortening 
contractions (1 contraction every 3 s).  For our study, participants performed a total of 200

shortening contractions every ~1.5 s.  Thus, the differences in the present study and that of 
Senefeld et al. (2013, 2016) may be explained by the muscle tested, number of contractions, or 
the work-to-rest ratio of the respective tasks. 
 
During maximal dynamic contractions, a critical component for achieving peak power is 
the capability to accelerate a limb quickly (Andersen et al. 2005).  In the current study, females 
exhibited less fatigue-related decrements in torque and velocity compared with males, but no 
fatigue-related differences were detected for RTD, RVD and rate of activation between sexes.  
Additionally, fatigue-related changes in RTD and RVD were correlated with a change in peak 
power whereby the highest correlation was observed with RVD.  Therefore, factors underlying 
RVD seem to be important for maintaining peak power during repetitive dynamic shortening 
contractions.  Because rate of activation for both plantar flexors tested here were not correlated 
with fatigue-related changes in peak power, limitations within the muscle likely contributed to 
the sex-related differences of decrements in peak power. 
 
Our study indicates that females are less fatigable than males when performing fast 
unconstrained velocity shortening plantar flexions and this sex-related difference is, at least 
partially, a result of time-dependent mechanical factors within the muscle that contribute to rapid 
power production.  The sex-related differences in fatigability may only be revealed when the 
system is stressed with a large number of contractions - as shown here - or to task failure (Yoon 
et al. 2015).  Future studies are required to determine the exact mechanisms and evaluate task-
dependency affecting the sex-related differences in dynamic fatigability as it relates to peak 
power production and time-dependent paradigms.  These results can be considered when 
designing exercise programs and may also lead to differences in work-related fatigue during 
dynamic strenuous activity for females and males.
