IMPORTANCE Previous studies have found marked differences in survival after in-hospital
cardiac arrest by race. Whether racial differences in survival have narrowed as overall survival
has improved remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES To examine whether racial differences in survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest
have narrowed over time and if such differences could be explained by acute resuscitation
survival, postresuscitation survival, and/or greater temporal improvement in survival at
hospitals with higher proportions of black patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cohort study from Get With the
Guidelines–Resuscitation, performed from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2014, a
total of 112 139 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest who were hospitalized in intensive care
units or general inpatient units were studied. Data analysis was performed from April 7, 2015,
to May 24, 2017.
EXPOSURE Race (black or white).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was survival to discharge. Secondary
outcomes were acute resuscitation survival and postresuscitation survival. Multivariable
hierarchical (2-level) regression models were used to calculate calendar-year rates of survival
for black and white patients after adjusting for baseline characteristics.
RESULTS Among 112 139 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, 30 241 (27.0%) were black
(mean [SD] age, 61.6 [16.4] years) and 81 898 (73.0%) were white (mean [SD] age, 67.5 [15.2]
years). Risk-adjusted survival improved over time in black (11.3% in 2000 and 21.4% in 2014)
and white patients (15.8% in 2000 and 23.2% in 2014; P for trend <.001 for both), with
greater survival improvement among black patients on an absolute (P for trend = .02) and
relative scale (P for interaction = .01). A reduction in survival differences between black and
white patients was attributable to elimination of racial differences in acute resuscitation
survival (black individuals: 44.7% in 2000 and 64.1% in 2014; white individuals: 47.1% in
2000 and 64.0% in 2014; P for interaction <.001). Compared with hospitals with fewer black
patients, hospitals with a higher proportion of black patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest
achieved larger survival gains over time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A substantial reduction in racial differences in survival after
in-hospital cardiac arrest has occurred that has been largely mediated by elimination of racial
differences in acute resuscitation survival and greater survival improvement at hospitals with
a higher proportion of black patients. Further understanding of the mechanisms of this
improvement could provide novel insights for the elimination of racial differences in survival
for other conditions.

For in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to a ventricu-
lararrhythmia,blackpatientshave12%lowerabsoluteand27%
lower relative survival compared with white patients.1,2 Simi-
larly, racial differences in survival have been reported for in-
hospitalcardiacarrestattributabletoasystoleorpulselesselec-
trical activity (PEA).3 Although the reasons underlying racial
differences in survival remain poorly defined, previous
studies2,4,5 suggest that racial differences may be attribut-
able in part to worse outcomes at hospitals that disproportion-
ately care for black patients.
During the past decade, survival after in-hospital cardiac
arrest has improved markedly at hospitals participating in Get
With the Guidelines–Resuscitation (GWTG-Resuscitation), a
national quality improvement program for in-hospital
resuscitation.1 However, whether improved trends in sur-
vival have benefited black and white patients equally has re-
mained unknown. Given the high incidence of in-hospital car-
diac arrest in the United States, it is critical to understand
whether recent improvements in survival have been accom-
panied by a reduction in racial differences in survival.
Accordingly, we examined trends in survival after in-
hospital cardiac arrest among black and white patients in
GWTG-Resuscitation and assessed whether racial differ-
ences have narrowed over time. To explain the underlying
mechanism of survival improvement, we evaluated differ-
ences between black and white patients in acute resuscita-
tion survival (ie, return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC]),
postresuscitation survival (ie, survival to discharge in pa-
tients with ROSC), and resuscitation quality measures. Fi-
nally, we examined whether hospitals with a higher propor-
tion of black patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest had the
largest increase in survival.
Methods
Study Population
The design of the GWTG-Resuscitation registry has been pre-
viously described in detail.6 The registry includes consecu-
tive patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (defined as the
absence of a palpable central pulse, apnea, and unrespon-
siveness in patients without a do-not-resuscitate [DNR]
order) who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
Patients are screened and enrolled by trained personnel at
participating hospitals. Data on cardiac arrests are collected
using standardized Utstein-style definitions to allow uni-
form reporting of clinical variables across sites.7-9 To opti-
mize capture of cases, various methods are used: centralized
collection of cardiac arrest flow sheets, hospital paging-
system logs, routine checks of code carts, pharmacy tracer
drug records, and hospital billing charges for resuscitation
medications. Rigorous training of research personnel for
operational definition adherence before data acceptance, a
periodic reabstraction process, and use of standardized soft-
ware are used for ensuring data completeness and accuracy
in the registry. The institutional review board at the Univer-
sity of Iowa approved the study and waived the requirement
for informed consent.
From January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2014, a total
of 189 782 patients 18 years or older with an index in-hospital
cardiac arrest were identified (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Because our study focused on racial differences between black
and white patients, we excluded 18 876 patients of other races
orpatientsforwhomraceinformationwasunavailable.Wealso
restricted our cohort to cardiac arrests that occurred in an in-
patient ward or intensive care unit and excluded 34 148 car-
diacarreststhatoccurredinoperatingrooms,proceduresuites,
or emergency departments because of the unique circum-
stances associated with cardiac arrest at such locations. In ad-
dition, 601 patients with missing data on survival or calendar
year of arrest were excluded. Finally, to obtain statistically re-
liable estimates of temporal trends in survival for black and
white patients, we restricted our cohort to hospitals with at
least 3 calendar years of data submission, a mean annual case
volume of at least 10 cardiac arrest cases, and at least 10 black
and 10 white patients. Thus, our final study population com-
prised 112 139 patients at 289 hospitals. Data analysis was per-
formed from April 7, 2015, to May 24, 2017.
Study Variables
Our primary exposure variable was black or white race as re-
ported by patients or their family members. Patient variables
included demographic characteristics (age, sex), medical con-
ditions before or at the time of cardiac arrest (congestive heart
failure [current or prior]; myocardial infarction [current or
prior]; diabetes; renal, hepatic, or respiratory insufficiency;
baseline central nervous system depression; acute stroke;
pneumonia; hypotension; sepsis; major trauma; metastatic
cancer; or metabolic or electrolyte abnormality), cardiac ar-
rest characteristics (initial rhythm [ventricular fibrillation,
pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, or PEA], the use of
a hospital-wide cardiopulmonary arrest alert, time of cardiac
arrest[daytime:7 AM-10:59 PM,nighttime:11 PM-6:59 AM,week-
end: Saturday or Sunday], cardiac arrest location [not moni-
tored, telemetry, or intensive care unit]), and interventions in
place before the arrest (use of intravenous vasopressors, an-
tiarrhythmic drugs, mechanical ventilation, and dialysis). Data
regarding hospital characteristics were obtained from the
American Hospital Association data and included geographic
Key Points
Question Have recent improvements in survival after in-hospital
cardiac arrest been accompanied by a reduction in racial
differences in survival?
Finding In this study of 30 241 black and 81 898 white patients
with in-hospital cardiac arrest at 289 hospitals in Get With the
Guidelines–Resuscitation, risk-adjusted survival improved over
time in both groups and differences in survival narrowed
significantly.
Meaning Racial differences in survival after in-hospital cardiac
arrest have decreased substantially at hospitals in a national
resuscitation quality improvement program.

 census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West), type of
hospital (major teaching: hospitals with a fellowship pro-
gram; minor teaching: hospitals with only a residency pro-
gram; or nonteaching: hospitals without a residency or fel-
lowship program), ownership (nonprofit or profit), location
(urban or rural), hospital bed size (<100, 100–499, or ≥500
beds), and availability of cardiac catheterization laboratory.
The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.
Secondaryoutcomesincludedacuteresuscitationsurvival(de-
fined as ROSC for at least 20 minutes) and postresuscitation
survival (defined as survival to hospital discharge among pa-
tientswhoachievedROSC).Giventheiroverallassociationwith
survival, we also evaluated the following resuscitation qual-
ity measures as secondary outcomes: (1) device confirmation
ofcorrectendotrachealtubeplacement,(2)amonitoredorwit-
nessed cardiac arrest event, (3) time to first chest compres-
sion of 1 minute or less, (4) time to first defibrillation of 2 min-
utesorlessforventriculartachycardiaorventricularfibrillation,
and (5) administration of epinephrine or vasopressin for PEA
or asystole within 5 minutes.10-13 In addition to the 5 indi-
vidual measures, we derived an overall composite measure of
defect-free care, defined as the proportion of patients who re-
ceived all interventions for which they were eligible.
Statistical Analysis
Given the large sample size, we compared baseline character-
istics between black and white patients by using standard-
ized differences. An absolute standard difference value greater
than 10% was considered to be a statistically meaningful
difference.14
Next, we calculated unadjusted rates of survival to dis-
charge among black and white patients for each calendar year
and then examined temporal trends by race over time. To
evaluate the effect of patient characteristics on the above tem-
poral trends, we constructed 2-level multivariable hierarchi-
cal regression models that account for clustering of patients
within hospitals and therefore avoided overestimation of sta-
tistical associations.15 Moreover, because hospitals may be-
gin and end participation in GWTG-Resuscitation at different
years, such models account for clustering of observations
within each year. In these models, hospital site and admis-
sion calendar year were included as random effects, whereas
race, race × calendar-year interaction term, and patient char-
acteristics described in the Study Variables subsection of the
Methods section were included as fixed effects. In the afore-
mentioned model, we specified a temporal correlation struc-
ture and assumed that the effect of race and the race-time in-
teraction did not vary by hospital site. We used the model
coefficients to calculate risk-adjusted rate of survival among
black and white patients for each calendar year and then sub-
tracted the risk-adjusted survival rate among black individu-
als from that among white individuals for each year to obtain
annual absolute survival differences between black and white
patients.
Mechanism of Improvement
We conducted additional analyses to identify factors that ex-
plain the underlying mechanism of survival improvement.
First, to determine whether reduction in survival difference
between black and white patients over time was attributable
to improvement in acute resuscitation survival, postresusci-
tation survival, or both, we constructed additional hierarchi-
cal multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome
by using the same approach as described in the previous sub-
section. Second, we examined temporal trends in rates of de-
fect-free care and the individual resuscitation quality mea-
suresbetweenblackandwhitepatientstodeterminetheextent
to which improvement in survival was attributable to a tem-
poral improvement in these measures. Furthermore, we re-
peated our analyses of racial differences in acute resuscita-
tion survival after additionally adjusting for defect-free care
as a patient-level categorical variable to determine whether
temporal changes in adherence to resuscitation guidelines ex-
plained the survival difference by race.
Hospital-Level Analyses
On the basis of prior work2 showing that lower survival rates
among black patients were largely attributable to the concen-
tration of black patients at hospitals with lower survival rates
after in-hospital cardiac arrest, we stratified hospitals accord-
ing to the proportion of black patients at each hospital. Hos-
pitals at which the proportion of black patients was below the
hospital median were classified as hospitals with a lower pro-
portion of black patients, and hospitals above the median were
classified as hospitals with a higher proportion of black pa-
tients. Hospital characteristics were compared between hos-
pitals with lower and higher proportions of black patients. To
determinewhethernarrowingofsurvivaldifferenceswasmore
marked in one hospital group compared with the other, we ex-
amined temporal trends in risk-adjusted rates of survival to
discharge at hospitals with lower and higher proportions of
black patients, in the overall population, and separately for
black and white patients at these hospitals. Risk-adjusted sur-
vival rates were derived using the aforementioned hierarchi-
cal models and included a calendar year by hospital group in-
teraction term.
All analyses were performed with SAS statistical soft-
ware, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc). All tests were 2 sided, and
P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Among 112 139 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest,
30 241 (27.0%) were black (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [16.4] years)
and 81 898 (73.0%) were white (mean [SD] age, 67.5 [15.2]
years). Differences in baseline characteristics by race are
summarized in Table 1. Compared with white patients, black
patients were younger and less likely to have an initial
rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular
tachycardia and current or prior myocardial infarction but
were more likely to have renal insufficiency, diabetes, base-
line central nervous system depression, and septicemia and
to have received dialysis before the arrest. Temporal trends
in baseline characteristics by race are summarized in eTable
1 in the Supplement.

 Survival to Discharge
During the study period, black patients had lower unadjusted
rates of survival to discharge compared with white patients
(15.4%vs19.9%;P < .001).Nonetheless,survivalimprovedover
time in both racial groups (Figure 1). After model adjustment,
risk-adjusted survival improved from 15.8% in 2000 to 23.2%
in 2014 among white patients and from 11.3% in 2000 to 21.4%
in 2014 among black patients (P for trend <.001 for both races)
(Table 2). However, the magnitude of survival improvement
was greater among black patients compared with white pa-
tients on an absolute scale (survival difference between black
and white patients decreased from 4.5% to 1.8% during the 15-
year period; P for trend = .02) (Table 2) and a relative scale
(compared with baseline, survival over time improved by
89.4% among black patients and by 46.8% among white pa-
tients; P for interaction <.001) (Table 2).
Secondary Outcomes
Unadjusted rates of acute resuscitation survival improved over
time in both racial groups (Figure 2). After risk adjustment,
acute resuscitation survival increased from 47.1% in 2000 to
64.0% in 2014 among white patients and from 44.7% in 2000
to 64.1% in 2014 among black patients (P for trend <.001 for
both); by 2014, racial differences in acute resuscitation
survival were eliminated (survival difference between black
and white patients: 2.3% in 2000 to –0.1% in 2014; P for

 trend = .002) (Table 2). In contrast, although risk-adjusted
postresuscitation survival also improved for both patient
groups (Table 2 and Figure 2), the absolute differences in
postresuscitation survival between black and white patients
persisted during the study period (survival difference be-
tween black and white patients: 1.6% in 2000 to 2.7% in 2014;
P for trend = .85).
Resuscitation Quality Measures
We found that the rate of defect-free care improved over time
among white individuals (73.3% in 2000 and 79.6% in 2014)
and black individuals (68.9% in 2000 and 79.5% in 2014; P for
trend <.001 for both groups). However, the magnitude of im-
provement over time was similar in both groups (P for inter-
action = .26)(eTable2andeFigure2intheSupplement).When
examined separately, temporal trends in performance on in-
dividual quality measures varied. Of importance, racial dif-
ferences in performance on individual measures, if any, were
small and did not change over time (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). Moreover, after additional adjustment for defect-free
care, differences in acute resuscitation survival by race that
were noted earlier in the study (2000-2010) became larger
(eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Hospital-Level Analysis
Overall, the median proportion of black patients in the 289
study hospitals was 23.1% (interquartile range [IQR], 13.0%-
38.1%; total range, 1.4%-94.2%). When categorized as hospi-
tals with a lower proportion of black patients (below median)
and a higher proportion of black patients (above median), the
medianproportionofblackpatientswas12.9%athospitalswith
a lower proportion of black patients (IQR, 8.0%-17.5%) and
38.1% at hospitals with a higher proportion of black patients
(IQR, 29.5%-52.2%). Hospital characteristics were similar be-
tween the 2 hospital groups except that private ownership was
more common among hospitals with a higher proportion of
black patients (eTable 4 in the Supplement). As shown in
Figure3,overallrisk-adjustedsurvivalathospitalswithahigher
proportion of black patients was 11.9% in 2000 compared with

By 2014, risk-adjusted survival had improved to 21.2% at hos-
pitals with a higher proportion of black patients and 23.4% at

 hospitals with a lower proportion of black patients. Although
survivalimprovedovertimeinbothhospitalgroups(Pfortrend
<.001),themagnitudeofimprovementwasmuchlargerathos-
pitals with a higher proportion of black patients (P for inter-
action = .01). When survival rates were examined separately
for black and white patients in both hospital groups (eFigure
3A and B in the Supplement), survival improvement over time
was consistent with our main findings.
Discussion
Our study has 3 principal findings. First, rates of survival to
discharge after in-hospital cardiac arrest have improved over
time among black and white patients, and racial differences
insurvivalhavenarrowed.Second,greaterimprovementinsur-
vival among black individuals compared with white individu-
als was largely mediated by elimination of racial differences
in acute resuscitation survival. Third, hospitals with a higher
proportion of black patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest
had lower baseline survival but the largest increases in sur-
vival over time. Collectively, our findings highlight a marked
narrowing in racial differences in survival after in-hospital
cardiac arrest.
Racial differences in clinical outcomes between black
and white patients have been described for several medical
conditions, including in-hospital cardiac arrest, and remain
a primary driver of lower life expectancy among black
patients.2-5,16,17 However, few studies have examined whether
racial differences in clinical outcomes have changed over time.
In a study18 using data from the National Health Interview Sur-
vey, differences in breast and colorectal cancer screening rates
between black and white individuals persisted during a 10-
year period from 2000 to 2010. In contrast, a study19 from the
GWTG–Heart Failure program found that differences in the use
ofimplantablecardiacdefibrillatorsforprimarypreventionthat
were present during 2005 were eliminated by 2010. Similar
studies20,21 from the GWTG programs in stroke and coronary
artery disease also found a temporal reduction in racial dif-
ferences with regard to provision of guideline-recommended
treatments. However, those studies primarily focused on pro-
cess-of-care measures and have not linked these changes to
narrowing of racial differences in clinical outcomes. In con-
trast, our study found a significant reduction in racial differ-
ences in survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest, primarily
through elimination of differences in acute resuscitation, and
highlighted that increases in survival were greatest in hospi-
tals that disproportionately care for black patients.
Previous studies2,4,5 have also highlighted the role of hos-
pital quality in explaining racial differences. An earlier GWTG-
Resuscitation study2 found that poor survival among black
patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest owing to ventricular ar-

 rhythmiaswaslargelyattributabletotheconcentrationofblack
patients in poor-quality hospitals. In fact, the hospital site at
which patients had their cardiac arrest accounted for 40% of
the racial difference in survival in that study. At the start of our
study, survival was 4.8% lower at hospitals with a higher pro-
portion of black patients compared with hospitals with a lower
proportion of black patients. Although survival improved at
both hospital groups over time, survival increases were larger
at hospitals with a higher proportion of black patients than at
hospitals with a lower proportion of black patients, suggest-
ing that reductions in racial differences over time were medi-
ated, at least in part, by greater improvement in survival out-
comes at hospitals that disproportionately serve black patients
with cardiac arrest.
We also found that, although racial gaps in acute resusci-
tation survival closed during the study period, racial differ-
ences in postresuscitation survival persisted between black
and white patients. Clinical practice guidelines in recent
years have emphasized important resuscitation quality
measures.22 We found that a temporal improvement in sur-
vival in both racial groups was accompanied by a modest
improvement in provision of defect-free care. However, dif-
ferences by race in provision of defect-free care and indi-
vidual quality measures were small and unlikely to account
for the temporal reduction in survival differences between
black and white patients. It is possible that strategies to
improve CPR quality, audiovisual feedback, routine mock
codes, and team debriefing, which are currently unmeasured
in GWTG-Resuscitation, explain the aforementioned trends
in survival by race.22-24
There were notable differences between black and white
patientsinourstudy.Althoughblackpatientswereyoungerand
had a lower prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, the
prevalence of most noncardiovascular comorbidities (eg, dia-
betes,septicemia,andpneumonia)washigher.Therefore,black
patients were more likely than white patients to have a cardiac
arrest attributable to asystole or PEA, rhythms that are associ-
atedwithworsesurvival.Thesefindingssuggestthatillnessse-
verity was higher and expected survival was lower in black in-
dividuals compared with white individuals. Second, prior
studies25,26 suggest that black patients are less likely to adopt
DNR status compared with white patients. Moreover, a recent
study27 of more than 300 000 patients hospitalized with heart
failure found that, although rates of DNR have increased mod-
estly (10.4% in 2007 to 11.3% in 2010) over time, the increase
was largely confined to white patients. Rates of DNR among
black patients remained unchanged in that study. Therefore,
the reduction in racial differences in survival over time noted
in our study is unlikely to be a result of greater adoption of DNR
status by black patients.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our study include the use of a large and contem-
porary database with a standardized definition of in-hospital
cardiacarrest,detailedinformationonimportantvariables,and
representation from a large number of hospitals. Of impor-
tance, we examined survival differences between black and
white patients not only on a relative scale but also on an ab-
solute scale. Given that black patients had lower survival at
baseline,agreaterrelativeimprovementovertimealonewould
be less meaningful if it were not accompanied by a reduction
in absolute difference in survival. Thus, our study could serve
asaparadigmforfuturestudiesexaminingappreciablechanges
in racial differences over time for other conditions.
Our findings should be interpreted in light of the follow-
ing limitations. First, participation in GWTG-Resuscitation is
voluntary; therefore, our results may not be generalizable to
nonparticipating hospitals. Second, information on race was
based on self-report, raising the possibility for misclassifica-
tion of race. However, a previous study28 found that the mag-
nitudeofmisclassificationofracebyself-reportcomparedwith
race reported on death certificate and medical record is small.
Third, although we adjusted for a number of potential con-
founders in our risk-adjusted analyses, the chance of residual
confounding attributable to unmeasured variables remains.
Fourth, we lacked information on important acute resuscita-
tion(eg,qualityofCPR,frequencyofinterruptions),postresus-
citation variables (eg, quality of nursing care, multidisci-
plinary teams), and hospital-specific quality improvement
initiatives (eg, routine mock codes), thus limiting our ability
to examine their association with racial differences in sur-
vival. Fifth, an increase in the use of DNR orders may account
for the observed trends in our study. However, that seems un-
likely given the temporal increase in illness severity, particu-
larly among black patients, and previous reports25,29,30 that
suggestloweruseofDNRandcomfort-directedcareandhigher
use of life-prolonging measures among black patients com-
pared with white patients. Finally, because our study fo-
cused on differences between white and black patients, the
findings are not applicable to other races.
Conclusions
We found a significant reduction in racial differences in sur-
vival after in-hospital cardiac arrest, largely mediated by elimi-
nation of racial differences in acute resuscitation and greater
survival improvement at hospitals with a higher proportion of
black patients. Further understanding the mechanisms of that
improvement could provide novel insights for the elimina-
tion of racial differences in survival for other conditions.

Racial Differences in In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
Good News: Cautious Optimism Is Welcome
Myron Weisfeldt, MD; Lance Becker, MD
Studiesofcardiacresuscitationinitiallyalertedustomajordis-
parities in survival between black and white Americans in the
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest setting.1,2 The disadvantage of
black race was striking, and
multiplepossiblefactorswere
cited, including lower rates of
bystander cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR),3 the ef-
fect of neighborhoods, socio-
economic factors, comorbidities, and delayed arrival of emer-
gencymedicalservicespersonnel.Itwasequallydisappointing
when studies of in-hospital arrest by the American Heart As-
sociation Get With the Guidelines (GWTG) registry recorded
similarly lower survival in black individuals despite the fact
that in-hospital identification of cardiac arrest, performance
of CPR and defibrillation, and upgrading of in-patient care
should not differ by race/ethnicity. This initial study from the
GWTGregistrydetailedstrikinglylowersurvivaltohospitaldis-
charge for black patients in general and, more specifically,
withinhospitalswithahigherpredominanceofblackpatients.4
In this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Joseph et al5 present
longitudinal GWTG registry data from 2000 to 2014 on
in-hospital cardiac arrest. The promising news is that not
only has the risk-adjusted lower survival of black patients
disappeared but also that overall survival for both white and
black individuals has increased substantially and signifi-
cantly, including in both predominantly black hospitals and
predominantly white hospitals. The authors cite the registry
efforts targeted at improving the quality of CPR and resusci-
tation performance as the likely mechanism for these sur-
vival improvements.5 Consistent with this hypothesis is the
fact that the largest survival improvements were seen in the
frequency of initial return of spontaneous circulation rather
than improved survival owing to better treatment later in
hospital care. The results are even more impressive for the
survival improvement, as the frequency of shockable cardiac
arrests deceased significantly during this period, with more
asystole and pulseless electrical activity present at the start
of resuscitation.
The authors make a strong case for the notion that the hos-
pitals that volunteered to participate in GWTG systematically
improved their CPR performance, leading to a higher quality of
care, frequency of return of spontaneous circulation, and sur-
vivaltodischarge.Wewouldliketobelievethisistrue,yetsome
caution in the interpretation of these data is warranted. The
GWTG program is voluntary, involves some cost, and included
only 289 of the nearly 5000 hospitals in the United States and
is thus a biased population; GWTG is unlikely to accurately rep-
resent typical hospitals of the nation. Whether these hospitals
represent the “best practice” in the country or not remains un-
certain. Whether the gap in racial disparity in survival has di-
minished in the rest of the nation is therefore uncertain.
A thoughtful reader may ask why we don’
t have vital data
like these for all hospitals in the country to promote similar
improvement in survival across the entire nation. Indeed, a
2015 national report by the Institute of Medicine/National
Academy of Medicine6 focused on this challenge, issuing as
its number one recommendation the creation of a national car-
diac arrest registry specifically to address this very important
gap in our ability to protect the health of the public. Addition-
ally, the current study failed to show robust improvement in
the timing and quality of resuscitation performance over the
same period and failed to show a relationship between the im-
proved survival and the index of defect-free survival.
It should be acknowledged that any effort to associate
causal factors with outcomes of health care from even an
elegant prospective registry is difficult. What other changes
in health care were going on between 2000 and 2014 that
might provide an alternative explanation for the improving
survival rates from in-hospital cardiac arrest? During this
15-year period, there has been a dramatic rise of in-hospital
palliative care units and the use of “do not resuscitate” or
“do not intubate” advance directives.7 Could this movement
have removed unfavorable patients from the denominator of
those to be resuscitated and resulted in numerically elevated
survival rates?
In addition, there has been a growth of rapid response
teams in US hospitals over the same period.8 Is a rapid re-
sponse team more likely to be present when the cardiac ar-
rest occurs and lead to faster treatments? Do rapid response
teamspreventcardiacarrestsfromtakingplaceinthefirstplace
or place more patients at risk for cardiac arrest in intensive care
