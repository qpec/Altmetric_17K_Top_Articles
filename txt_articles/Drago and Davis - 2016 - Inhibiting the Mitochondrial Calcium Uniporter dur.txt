SUMMARY
The uptake of cytoplasmic calcium into mitochondria
is critical for a variety of physiological processes,
including calcium buffering, metabolism, and cell
survival. Here, we demonstrate that inhibiting the
mitochondrial calcium uniporter in the Drosophila
mushroom body neurons (MBn)—a brain region crit-
ical for olfactory memory formation—causes mem-
ory impairment without altering the capacity to learn.
Inhibiting uniporter activity only during pupation
impaired adult memory, whereas the same inhibition
during adulthood was without effect. The behavioral
impairment was associated with structural defects in
MBn, including a decrease in synaptic vesicles and
an increased length in the axons of the ab MBn.
Our results reveal an in vivo developmental role for
the mitochondrial uniporter complex in establishing
the necessary structural and functional neuronal
substrates for normal memory formation in the adult
organism.
INTRODUCTION
The mitochondrion is a pivotal player in orchestrating the
complexities of cellular calcium signaling (Rizzuto et al., 2012).
Decades of research have demonstrated that mitochondrial cal-
cium handling impacts diverse aspects of cellular physiology
including metabolism, cell survival, and autophagy (Rizzuto
et al., 2012). The recent identification of proteins involved in mito-
chondrial calcium entry (MCE) has significantly advanced our
knowledge of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial calcium interactions
and offered molecular tools to explore more deeply the physio-
logical roles of MCE (Kamer and Mootha, 2015).
MCE is mediated by a macromolecular complex composed
by the pore forming subunit, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter
(MCU), and several regulatory subunits including MICU1, MICU2,
and EMRE (Baughman et al., 2011; De Stefani et al., 2011; Peroc-
chi et al., 2010; Plovanich et al., 2013; Sancak et al., 2013)
(Figure 1A). MCU is a highly conserved protein bearing two trans-
membrane domains connected by a loop facing the intermem-
brane space (Baughman et al., 2011; De Stefani et al., 2011).
The calcium selective pore of the complex is likely formed as
a pentamer of MCU subunits (Oxenoid et al., 2016). The regula-
tory subunit MICU1 resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane
space (Csorda
´ s et al., 2013). MICU1 and its paralog MICU2
(Plovanich et al., 2013) together detect changes in cytoplasmic
calcium and modulate the activity of MCU (Kamer and Mootha,
2014; Patron et al., 2014), whereas the inner mitochondrial mem-
brane protein EMRE is required for the assembly of the uniporter
complex (Sancak et al., 2013).
A fascinating aspect surrounding MCE is the observation that
human patients carrying loss-of-function mutations in MICU1
exhibit learning disability, along with skeletal muscle myopathy
and movement disorders (Lewis-Smith et al., 2016; Logan
et al., 2014). Moreover, deficits in cognition are associated with
many mitochondrial protein mutations (Finsterer, 2012), and
many neurodegenerative disorders have associated mitochon-
drial defects (Schon and Przedborski, 2011). Experiments per-
formed in rhesus monkeys demonstrated that the number of
normal, oblong-shaped mitochondria (as opposed to ‘‘donut-
shaped’’ malformed ones) directly correlates with synapse size
and working memory test scores, thus suggesting that mitochon-
drial functions are important for learning and memory processes
(Hara et al., 2014, 2016). There are, however, no studies investi-
gating the hypothesis that MCE is linked to cognitive function.
MCU knockout mice on an outbred strain display only a very
mild muscle phenotype, but embryonic lethality when crossed
into a C57BL/6 inbred line (Murphy et al., 2014; Pan et al.,
2013). Learning and memory tests on these animals have not
yet been reported.
Drosophila melanogaster is an invaluable model organism to
discover new connections between genes involved in MCE
and cellular and behavioral functions due to the ease of perform-
ing large forward genetic screens and the tools to control trans-
gene expression in both time and space. In a large behavioral
screen of olfactory memory, using flies expressing individual
RNAis in all neurons, Walkinshaw et al. (2015) identified hun-
dreds of new genes whose disruption impaired or enhanced
memory formation. Two components of the mitochondrial uni-
porter complex, MCU and MICU1, were identified among those
that impaired memory when silenced.
This prompted us to test the hypothesis that MCE regulates
memory formation and probe a mechanistic understanding
for its role. We found that normal MCE is required in the mush-
room body neurons (MBn)—a primary neuronal assembly of

 the olfactory nervous system—for normal intermediate-term
memory (ITM). Surprisingly, although the behavioral phenotype
was assayed in adult animals, the requirement for normal MCE
occurred during the developmental stage of pupation. Moreover,
the ITM deficit was not associated with a detectable learning
deficit, as one might expect from a developmental genetic
insult. In addition, we found evidence that inhibiting MCE in
MBn causes a decrease in synaptic vesicle content and an
increase in axonal length and field volume. Thus, normal MCE
establishes, during development, a neuronal structural and/or
functional competence for supporting adult memory.
RESULTS
MCU Expression and Function in MBn Is Necessary for
Intermediate-Term Memory but Not Learning
The Drosophila gene CG18769 is the homolog of mammalian
MCU and its protein product localizes to mitochondria (Lye
et al., 2014). CG18769 was first identified as a candidate gene
in a pan-neuronal RNAi screen aimed at discovering new genes
that are critical for memory formation (Walkinshaw et al., 2015).
When silenced, it impaired ITM, tested 3 hr after conditioning.
Based on these results, we hypothesized that MCE is critical
for memory formation.
To extend this observation, we silenced MCU by crossing the
CG18769-specific UAS-RNAi line (v110781) with GAL4;UAS-
dcr2 fly lines representing different neuronal subpopulations of
the Drosophila olfactory system (Figure 1B). Line 60100, that
bears the same, but empty, docking sites used to insert MCU
RNAi in v110781 flies was crossed to the same battery of
GAL4>UAS-dcr2 lines as the control. Silencing MCU using the
pan-neuronal driver nSyb-GAL4 produced memory impairment
when tested 3 hr after training (Figure 1C). The MBn-preferential
drivers, 238y- and R13F02-GAL4, were the only drivers that
reproduced the 3 hr memory impairment observed with pan-
neuronal MCU silencing. These results map MCU function to
MBn (Figure 1C). Ubiquitous expression of MCU RNAi produced
lethality. Crosses of either Actin-GAL4/CyO or Tubulin-GAL4/
TM3 to homozygous UAS-MCU RNAi flies produced only prog-
eny carrying the balancer chromosome.
We focused experiments at this point using R13F02-GAL4 as a
driver, because it displays strong MBn expression with extremely
limited expression in other populations of neurons (http://flweb.
janelia.org/cgi-bin/view_flew_imagery.cgi?line=R13F02). We
tested the UAS-MCU RNAi insertion alone and found it performs
equivalently to R13F02-GAL4, with memory impairment occur-
ring only upon combining the driver and UAS-RNAi transgene
(Figure 1D).
We measured memory decay by training flies and testing their
memory at different time points after conditioning (Figure 1E).
While the immediate memory (3 min) of control and silenced flies
was not significantly different, MCU silencing produced an ITM
impairment, demonstrated by the significant decrease in 1 and
3 hr memory (Figure 1E). This deficit was not attributable to an
impaired ability of MCU silenced flies to perceive the odors and
the shock used during the training protocol as measured by stan-
dard avoidance tests (Figure S1A). To test the possibility that
MCU silencing produces a learning impairment that is too subtle
to be revealed by the standard training protocol, which employs
odor presentation coupled with 12 shock pulses at 90 V, we
trained flies using fewer shocks (Figure 1F) or a lower voltage
(Figure S1H). No significant difference was observed between
control and MCU-silenced flies, confirming that MCU function
is required in the MBn for ITM but not for olfactory learning.
ITM is composed of two distinct types of memory—anesthesia-
sensitive memory (ASM) and anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM)
(Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014). While ASM is eliminated by a
cold shock performed between training and testing, ARM repre-
sents a consolidated form of memory that remains unaffected
by this insult.

(A) Schematic representation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex including MCU, EMRE, MICU1, and MICU2. Other components of the channel are
omitted for simplicity. The complex is situated in the inner mitochondrial membrane to mediate calcium import from the intermembrane space into the matrix. The
amino acids of MCU that, when mutated, produce a dominant-negative form, are identified as red dots.
(B) Schematic diagram of the three transgenes used to silence MCU in a tissue-specific manner. One transgene carries GAL4 transcription activator sequences
under the control of a tissue-specific promoter. The GAL4 protein is expressed in a tissue-specific way, driving the transcription of MCU RNAi and dicer-2 (dcr-2)
mRNA by binding to upstream activating sequences (UAS elements) carried on the two other transgenes. Dicer-2 expression enhances the effect of the RNAi.
(C) MCU silencing in MBn impaired memory. UAS-dcr2 or UAS-dcr2;MCU RNAi flies were crossed to a battery of GAL4 lines that drive expression of UAS-
transgenes in specific populations of neurons. MBn, mushroom body neurons; DPM, dorsal paired medial neurons; DA, dopaminergic neurons; Pn AL, projection

The nSyb-GAL4 pan-neuronal driver was used as a positive control (**p < 0.01). Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM with n R 8 and were analyzed by two-
tailed, two-sample Student’s t tests.
(D) MCU silencing in MBn impaired 3 hr memory relative to two independent genetic controls: flies that are heterozygous either for the R13F02-GAL4 insertion or
the UAS-MCU RNAi insertion. PIs are expressed as the mean ± SEM with n = 12 and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests
(**p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).

 To better characterize the decrease in ITM observed upon
MCU silencing, we eliminated the ASM portion of ITM by per-
forming a cold shock 2 hr after training. Three-hour memory in
MCU-silenced flies after cold shock was statistically lower than
the cold-shocked controls, revealing that MCU expression in
MBn neurons is required for ARM (Figure 1G). A second assay
for ARM is to measure memory at 24 hr after five consecutive cy-
cles of training without any rest between cycles. Such massed
conditioning produces ARM that persists more than a day but
is independent of new protein synthesis. After 53 massed
training, MCU-silenced flies exhibited depressed 24 hr memory
compared to the controls, confirming that MCU function sup-
ports ARM (Figure 1H).
We considered the possibility that the memory impairment
occurred through off-target effects of the RNAi transgene. We
thus searched for an independent method to confirm the hypoth-
esis that MCU is required in MBn for normal ITM. The substitution
of two negatively charged amino acids in the DIME domain of
MCU creates a dominant-negative form of the channel (Baugh-
man et al., 2011; De Stefani et al., 2011) (Figure 1A). We therefore
generated flies with the insertion of UAS-MCUD260Q,E263Q car-
rying a FLAG epitope. We verified the mitochondrial localization
of MCUD260Q,E263Q by driving its expression in MBn together with
a mitochondrial targeted GFP (mito-GFP). The punctate expres-
sion of the anti-FLAG epitope (Figure 2A) was coincident with
mito-GFP (Figure 2C) as detected with anti-GFP immunohisto-
chemistry (Figure 2B).
The expression of MCUD260Q,E263Q in MBn did not produce
any impairment in immediate memory (Figure 2D) but caused
a significant decrease in 3 hr memory compared to the
GAL4-only and UAS-only controls (Figure 2E). The same
conclusion was reached upon testing a second and indepen-
dent MCUD260Q,E263Q line with expression in MBn (Figure 2F).
As already observed with MCU silencing, MCUD260Q,E263Q
expression in MBn did not cause a learning impairment, even
when flies were subjected to a sub-maximal training protocol
(Figure 2G). Finally, we verified that MCUD260Q,E263Q expression
did not alter odors or shock avoidance (Figure S1D). Collec-
tively, these results demonstrate that MCU expression and
function are required in MBn to support ITM, but not learning.
Impairing MCU Function in MBn Decreases MCE
The results above suggested that the impairment of ITM occur-
ring with genetic insults to MCU function were due to decreased
MCE. To confirm this, we generated flies expressing a calcium
reporter targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Upon crossing
UAS-4mtGCaMP3 flies with a MBn driver, we observed a punc-
tate pattern of fluorescence in the tip of the MBn vertical lobe that
was characteristic of mitochondria (Figure 3A). We then tested
the ability of the reporter to measure calcium changes by stimu-
lating isolated brains expressing 4mtGCaMP3 with KCl. This
challenge produced increased fluorescence with increasing
KCl concentrations that reached a threshold at 50 mM, consis-
tent with the interpretation that KCl treatment increased cyto-
plasmic calcium that in turn activated MCE (Figure 3B).
To confirm the expected localization of the 4mtGCaMP3 re-
porter to the mitochondrial matrix, we pre-incubated brains with
carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP),
an ionophore that dissipates the mitochondrial potential and
thus eliminates the driving force for mitochondrial, but not cyto-
plasmic, calcium entry. FCCP pre-treatment completely abol-
ished the increase of 4mtGCaMP3 signal upon stimulation with
KCl, confirming that the reporter properly localizes in the mito-
chondrial matrix (Figure 3C).
We then asked whether the genetic insults to MCU function that
cause a decrease in ITM produce a decrease in MCE. We
compared the mitochondrial calcium peak response upon KCl
stimulation in control and MCU silenced brains (Figure 3D).
MCE withMCU silencing was18%± 11%of thecontrolresponse,
normalized to 100%, thus demonstrating that MCU RNAi effec-
tively impaired MCE. In MCUD260Q,E263Q-expressing brains,
the response upon KCl stimulation was 46% ± 11% of the con-
trol (Figure 3E). These experiments demonstrate that the ge-
netic insults using UAS-MCU RNAi or UAS-MCUD260Q,E263Q
expression dramatically decreased MCE that likely translate to
impaired ITM.
Silencing MICU1 in MBn Recapitulates the Memory
Impairment Caused by Silencing MCU
Another component of the uniporter complex that was identified
as a hit in the original RNAi screen was CG4495 (Walkinshaw
et al., 2015), the Drosophila homolog of MICU1. To further char-
acterize MICU1’s role in learning and memory, we silenced
MICU1 in MBn. While 3 min memory in MICU1-silenced flies
was indistinguishable from the control (Figure 4A), 3 hr memory
was impaired (Figure 4B). MICU1 silencing failed to reveal a
learning defect as assayed with sub-maximal training protocols
(Figure 4C). Moreover, the memory decrease was not attributable
to an odor or shock avoidance defect (Figure S1E). The memory
decay curve of MICU1-silenced flies revealed an ITM defect (Fig-
ure 4D), while cold shock (Figure 4E) and massed training exper-
iments (Figure 4F) showed that MICU1 is required for ARM,
similar to that observed with MCU silencing. Like our results using
UAS-MCU RNAi, silencing MICU1 using the ubiquitous drivers
Actin-GAL4/CyO or Tubulin-GAL4/TM3 failed to produce prog-
eny without a balancer chromosome. We then measured the
effect of MICU1 RNAi on MCE. Upon KCl stimulation, flies with
MICU1 silenced in the MBn showed a mitochondrial calcium in-
crease that was 70% ± 6% of the control (Figure 4G).
The results of these experiments silencing MICU1 in the MBn
along with the results from two genetic insults directed at MCU
provide compelling evidence that MCE impairment is associated
with a memory deficit at intermediate times after conditioning but
with no detectable difference in learning.
MCE in MBn Is Required during Development to Support
ITM in Adult Flies
The simplest model derived from the above results that incorpo-
rates general knowledge about calcium signaling in physiolog-
ical events was that MCE might underlie ITM mediated by MBn
in an acute way at the time of conditioning and testing of adult
flies. Given that the genetic insults used were also present during
the development of the organism, the less likely model was that
MCE participated in some process during the development of
the MBn that was required for the competence of these neurons
to support ITM.

 We took advantage of the TARGET system (McGuire et al.,
2003) to distinguish between these two alternatives. TARGET
employs the constitutive expression of the temperature-sensi-
tive GAL4 inhibitor GAL80 (GAL80ts) to suppress GAL4 func-
tion at 18�C. Shifting flies from 18�C to 30�C destabilizes
GAL80ts and thus allows GAL4 to drive the expression of
UAS insertions. We tested the 3 hr memory of flies carrying
the tub-GAL80ts insertion in which MCU RNAi, MICU1 RNAi,
or MCUD260Q,E263Q were expressed in MBn only during adult-
hood (18�C–30�C condition) or development (30�C–18�C con-
dition), with temperature shifts occurring right after adult
eclosion. As a negative control, we employed flies maintained

 at 18�C, whereas flies maintained at 30�C were used as the
positive control (Figure 5A).
The results from this experiment produced the stunning
conclusion that MCE is required during development and not
during adulthood for normal ITM (Figure 5A). The temperature
shift condition that reproduced the ITM impairment observed
earlier due to MCE inhibition both during development and
adulthood was 30�C–18�C, demonstrating that an efficient
MCE before adult eclosion is necessary to support ITM in adult
flies. Shifting flies from 18�C to 30�C after eclosion to impair
MCE during adulthood was without effect on memory.
To further delimit MCE requirement during development, we
performed TARGET experiments restricting MCU silencing to
more precise developmental stages. We synchronized the
development of broods of flies by allowing parents an egg-laying
time window of 6 hr. While MCU silencing until late third instar
failed to alter 3 hr memory in adult flies, silencing from the late
third instar to eclosion produced a significant decrease in 3 hr
memory (Figure 5B). We then shifted flies after puparium for-
mation. Mushroom bodies undergo a profound reorganization
during pupation (Lee et al., 1999). Flies in which MCU was
silenced in MBn from egg laying to puparium formation exhibited

 unimpaired 3 hr memory (Figure 5C). In contrast, silencing MCU
starting after pupariation was sufficient to produce an ITM defect
in adult flies (Figure 5C). These results map the requirement for
MCE function to pupation.
Normal MCE in the ab and g MBn Is Required for
Normal ITM
The MBn in adult flies are classed into three major structural
types whose axons project into brain neuropil areas termed
the ab, a0b0, and g lobes (Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014).
As detailed above, MCE function in the MBn for ITM maps to
pupation, a stage during which the already formed g MBn
axons are being pruned and the ab MBn are born (Lee et al.,
1999). To determine whether MCE is required specifically in
one of the three classes of MBn, we silenced MCU with a panel
of MBn-specific GAL4 drivers (Figure 6A). None of the tested
MBn subclass-specific drivers reproduced the 3 hr memory
decrease observed with MCU silencing using a pan-MBn
driver. This might be due to at least three different reasons.
First, it may be that the drivers tested do not have the neces-
sary potency. Second, the drivers tested may not be expressed
during the required pupal stage necessary to see the effect.
Third, the ITM memory phenotype observed with pan-MBn
drivers may be due to the composite expression in more than
one class of MBn.
We reasoned that the latter possibility was most likely and
tested this idea using drivers that express GAL4 in two of the
three major MBn classes. We failed to see a significant decrease
in adult ITM upon driving the expression of UAS-MCU with
NP1131-GAL4, an element promoting expression in both
a0b0 and g MBn, or by driving expression with a combination
of a0b0 and ab-specific MBn drivers (c305a- and c739-GAL4)
(Figure 6A). In contrast, we observed a significant decrease
in ITM using 201y-GAL4 and R25H11-GAL4, elements that pro-
mote expression in both ab and g MBn. We also found the same
aforementioned developmental requirement for this pair of MBn
types using 201y-GAL4 in temperature shift TARGET experi-
ments (Figure S2A). We examined the expression pattern of
these GAL4 elements along with the pan-MBn driver R13F02-
GAL4 by imaging the mCD8::GFP reporter during the phenocrit-
ical period of pupation (Figure 6B). All three GAL4 elements
drove strong GFP fluorescence in the g MBn and weak expres-
sion in the ab MBn 2 days into pupation. By 4 days into pupation,
the GFP expression was strong in both the g and ab MBn. This
developmental expression pattern analysis is consistent with a
requirement for normal MCE in both ab and g MBn during pupa-
tion for normal ITM in adult flies.
We confirmed these results by measuring 3 hr memory in flies
in which MICU1 RNAi expression was driven by 201y-GAL4 (Fig-
ure S2B) or R25H11-GAL4 (Figure S2C). We observed a similar
decrement in ITM using both drivers. We found no significant dif-
ference between control and MCU- or MICU1-silenced flies in
odor and shock avoidance assays performed with the ab- and
g-specific drivers (Figures S1B, S1C, S1F, and S1G).
Silencing MCU Decreases Synaptic Vesicles in MBn
The developmental requirement for normal MCE to obtain normal
ITM in adult flies presented the hypothesis that MCE is involved
in the structural or physiological development of MBn necessary
to support adult memory. MCU silencing might thus cause a
structural change in MBn that is important for ITM. We tested
this hypothesis by comparing mCD8::GFP expression in control
and MCU-silenced flies. For these experiments, we used the
201y-GAL4 driver because it offered the most restricted subset
of MBn required for MCE-mediated ITM. A significant difference
in the mean average fluorescence intensity between control and
experimental group could reflect a change in the number of
axonal or dendritic fibers occupying a defined space or a change
in the volume of space occupied by the neuritic fibers.
We stained adult brains with an anti-GFP antibody and
measured the mean fluorescence intensity of a region of interest
(ROI) that includes the horizontal lobes of the MBn (Figure 7A).
The average signal intensity did not differ between control and
MCU-silenced brains (Figure 7A). We repeated the analysis for
the MBn calyx and also found no difference (Figure 7B). The re-
sults from these coarse experiments indicate that MCU silencing
does not cause a gross structural alteration in MBn neuropil.
We then extended our analyses to assay synaptic vesicle con-
tent in the MBn horizontal lobes using as a surrogate the synaptic
vesicle marker syt::GFP (Zhang et al., 2002). Silencing MCU
caused a significant decrease of the mean syt::GFP fluores-
cence intensity (Figure 7C), suggesting that MCE impairment
reduces synaptic vesicle number and/or size in the horizontal
MBn lobes. We also analyzed the dendritic compartment of the
MBn using the dendritic marker DenMark (Nicolaı
¨ et al., 2010).
In this case, no difference between control and MCU-silenced
flies was found (Figure 7D).
To determine whether the decrease in syt::GFP signal was due
to an acute decrease in MCE in adult flies but inconsequential to
memory, or whether it tracked the developmental requirement
for normal MCE for complete ITM, we analyzed syt::GFP staining
in flies in which MCU RNAi and syt::GFP expression were
controlled using the TARGET system. We stained brains in which
MCU RNAi and syt::GFP were expressed both during develop-
ment and adulthood (Figure 7E). We confirmed the decrease
in syt::GFP mean intensity already shown in Figure 7C without
the presence of the tub-GAL80ts insertion. However, we failed
to detect this difference when the expression of MCU RNAi
and syt::GFP were activated after eclosion (Figure 7F). The recip-
rocal temperature shift experiment of activating MCU RNAi and
syt::GFP expression during development with a downshift at
eclosion would not be revealing because the reporter transgene
would be shut off during adulthood and therefore undetectable.
Altogether, these data show that the decrease in synaptic vesicle
(F) Silencing MICU1 in MBn impaired memory after 53 massed training. PIs are expressed as the mean ± SEM with n = 12 and were analyzed by two-tailed, two-
sample Student’s t tests (**p < 0.01).
(G) Silencing MICU1 in MBn decreased MCE in isolated brains (**p < 0.01). The 15 mM KCl peak responses of controls were normalized to 100%; responses of the
MICU1 silenced group are expressed as the normalized DF/F0 ± SEM with n = 14 and were analyzed by two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t test. Representative
individual traces of a control (open circles) and MICU1 silenced brain (gray circles) are shown at the right.

mental requirement for normal ITM.
MCU Silencing Causes an Increase of ab MBn Axon
Length and Field Volume
Although the data presented above point to an association
between pupal stage MCE, ITM, and synaptic vesicle number
using the syt::GFP as a reporter, we wondered whether there
might be other structural changes to the MBn that remained
undetectable from these analyses. We thus labeled and
analyzed the structure of single MBn using flies expressing
a photoactivatable GFP (Ruta et al., 2010) (Figure 7G). We
first focused on ab MBn because they are formed during
the same developmental time window during which MCE is

Figure 5. MCE Is Required in MBn during Pupation to Support Olfactory Memory in Adult Flies
The GAL80ts protein inhibits GAL4 protein activity at 18�C but not 30�C, thus allowing experimenter-control over the expression of UAS-MCU RNAi, UAS-MICU1
RNAi, or UAS-MCUD260Q,E263Q using temperature shifts at specific time periods during development or adulthood.
(A) Silencing MCU or MICU1, or expressing MCUD260Q,E263Q only during development (30�C–18�C) produced a 3 hr memory impairment similar to that observed
upon silencing MCU or MICU1, or expressing MCUD260Q,E263Q, across development and into adulthood (30�C–30�C condition). PIs are expressed as the mean ±
SEM with n R 8 and they were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
(B) Silencing MCU from egg laying until late third instar was not sufficient to produce a memory impairment in adult flies (green bar), while silencing MCU from late
third instar to eclosion was sufficient to produce 3 hr memory impairment (orange bar) (***p < 0.001). PIs are expressed as the mean ± SEM with n R 12 and they
were analyzed by two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t tests.
(C) Silencing MCU from egg laying up the end of puparium formation failed to cause a memory impairment in adult flies (yellow bar), while silencing MCU from the
end of puparium formation to eclosion was sufficient to produce the impairment (blue bar), thus mapping MCU function to pupation. PIs are expressed as the
mean ± SEM with n R 12 and they were analyzed by two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t tests (**p < 0.01).

 required for normal adult ITM (e.g., after pupariation) (Lee
et al., 1999).
Silencing MCU caused a significant increase in the length
of the ab MBn axons (control: 270 ± 9 mm; MCU RNAi: 329 ±
10 mm; Figure 7H). The number of nodes (junctions) was not
statistically different (control: 2.8 ± 0.4 nodes; MCU RNAi:
4.4 ± 0.8 nodes; Figure 7I; p = 0.1). We then performed a convex
Hull analysis to estimate the volume of the MBn lobe occupied by
each photoactivated ab axon. With MCU silencing, ab MBn ex-
hibited an increase in the axonal field volume (control: 40,687 ±
2,813 mm3; MCU RNAi: 60,126 ± 5,114 mm3; Figure 7J). Single
neuron structural analysis thus demonstrated that MCE is asso-
ciated with proper control over axonal length and volume. This
conclusion was true only for ab MBn; the same analyses in g
MBn (Figure S3A) failed to show any significant change in axon
length, nodes or field volume (Figures S3B–S3D).

Only GAL4 drivers that promote expression of the RNAi in both ab and g MBn decreased 3 hr memory (**p < 0.001). Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM

 in neurons in vivo, and in particular in cognitive processes such
as learning and memory, is poor. In the current study, we manip-
ulated the function of the uniporter complex in the Drosophila
CNS both during development and in the adult animal and
related these perturbations to learning and memory. Our results
offer four major conclusions: (1) the uniporter is specifically
required in ab and g MBn for ITM performance but not for acqui-
sition; (2) it is required during development and not during adult-
hood at the time of conditioning and testing for flies to display
normal ITM; (3) the developmental perturbation that impairs
ITM also reduces the synaptic vesicle content in the MBn axons;
(4) MCU knockdown does not alter g MBn structure, but it in-
creases ab MBn axon length by �20% and the volume of neuro-
pil occupied by �50%.
Our findings linking developmental MCE impairment to mem-
ory might seem surprising given the report that outbred MCU
knockout mice display only a very mild muscle phenotype (Pan
et al., 2013). However, the MICU1 knockout is perinatally lethal
(Antony et al., 2016) and MCU knockout in a C56BL/6 back-
ground is embryonically lethal (Murphy et al., 2014). Consistent
with the lethality associated with mouse MCU loss of function,
we observed that ubiquitous RNAi-mediated silencing of MCU
or MICU1 produces late-pupal lethality. The genetic toolkit that
includes RNAi transgenes available to study gene function in
Drosophila allowed us to circumvent this lethality and map
MCE requirement for adult ITM to the pupal stage of develop-
ment and to specific populations of neurons (ab and g MBn).
It is surprising that genetic insults to MCE during development
impair memory in the adult organism without detectably altering
acquisition. MCE is a key regulator of many important cellular
functions, including coupling of cellular stimulation with ATP pro-
duction and buffering of cytoplasmic calcium transients (Rizzuto
et al., 2012). Because of these real-time cellular functions, we
had anticipated that the uniporter’s role in ITM would be de-
limited to the adult stage and not to developmental stages
that precede conditioning and testing by more than 4 days.
One might also anticipate that developmental influences would
impact acquisition and memory, rather than specifically affecting
memory. However, one caveat of this is that the genetic modifi-
cations used in this study produce a partial loss of function and
more severe insults might influence acquisition processes. Over-
all, the results dictate the conclusion that uniporter function in
developing MBn establishes the neurons’ competence to sup-
port adult memory by participating in processes that provide
proper neuronal structure, physiology, and/or circuitry.
Our single-cell photoactivation studies revealed that ab MBn
axons of MCU silenced flies are longer and occupy more neuropil
volume. Interestingly, the ab MBn are born after puparium
formation (Lee et al., 1999), coinciding in time with the MCU
requirement to support ITM. Like neurons from mammalian spe-
cies, Drosophila MBn undergo activity-dependent refinement in
the first few hours after eclosion (Doll and Broadie, 2014; Tessier
and Broadie, 2008). Thus, it may be that MCE is required for
axonal growth control during pupation or for the activity-depen-
dent refinement of neuronal processes (Tessier and Broadie,
2008). At this stage, the growth control hypothesis seems more
likely because a defect in activity-dependent refinement is pre-
dicted to cause an increase in short branches only (Tessier and
Broadie, 2008). The g MBn may escape the effect of MCE inhibi-
tion through compensatory mechanisms or their axonal retrac-
tion/re-extension phase during early pupation (Lee et al., 1999)
may be slightly outside of the MCE phenocritical time window.
The structural change of ab neurons is not likely the sole cause
of the observed ITM impairment because driving MCU RNAi
expression specifically in these neurons should have reproduced
the ITM decrease observed with combined ab and g expression.
The developmental decrease in synaptic vesicle content
that we measured with synaptotagmin-GFP expression offers
an additional cellular correlate for the ITM phenotype. Numerous
studies have linked synaptic release with mitochondrial function
(Ivannikov et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013; Verstreken et al., 2005),
and MCU silencing reportedly increases the rate of synaptic
vesicle endocytosis (Marland et al., 2016). However, these
studies involve acute physiological stimulation. How MCE
identifies the ROI designed for horizontal lobe analysis. Mean fluorescence intensity is expressed as the mean ± SEM with n = 8. Comparisons were made using a
two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t test. Scale bar, 10 mm.
(B) Silencing MCU did not alter the mean fluorescence intensity of MBn calyces obtained by expressing mCD8::GFP with 201y-GAL4. The dotted line identifies
the ROI designed for calyx analysis. Mean fluorescence intensity is expressed as the mean ± SEM with n = 8. Comparisons were made using a two-tailed, two-

(C) Silencing MCU decreased the mean signal intensity of the synaptic vesicle reporter syt::GFP. Mean fluorescence intensity is expressed as the mean ± SEM
with n = 8. Comparisons were made using a two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t test (*p < 0.05). Scale bar, 10 mm.
(D) MCU silencing failed to cause a significant change in the dendritic compartment using DenMark mean fluorescence intensity as a reporter. Mean fluorescence
intensity is expressed as the mean ± SEM with n = 8. Comparisons were made using a two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t test. Scale bar, 10 mm.
(E) MCU silencing across development and adulthood using the TARGET system produced a significant decrease in the mean intensity of syt::GFP fluorescence.
Mean fluorescence intensity is expressed as the mean ± SEM with n = 8. Comparisons were made using a two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t test (*p < 0.05).
(F) MCU silencing during adulthood only using the TARGET system did not produce a significant decrease in the mean intensity of syt::GFP fluorescence. Mean
fluorescence intensity is expressed as the mean ± SEM with n = 8. Comparisons were made using a two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t test. The combined data
suggest that the decrease observed in (E) occurs from MCU silencing during development.

 inhibition during development might translate to an adult deficit
in synaptic vesicle content requires further study.
Our discovery of a developmental role for the mitochondrial
calcium uniporter complex in regulating ITM in adult flies is
particularly interesting because patients carrying loss-of-func-
tion mutations in MICU1 display learning difficulties (Lewis-
Smith et al., 2016; Logan et al., 2014). Our results measuring a
decreased KCl-stimulated calcium entry into mitochondria with
MICU1 deficiency is consistent with the impaired mitochondrial
uptake observed by Lewis-Smith et al. (2016) in MICU1-deficient
human fibroblasts. However, these results are opposite to the
increased rate observed for histamine-stimulated, MICU1-defi-
cient fibroblasts as reported by Logan et al. (2014). In light of
these discrepancies, it is difficult to draw a strict correlation
between MICU1 function, calcium entry into mitochondria,
and cognition. Nevertheless, there are many explanations for
the observed differences in results, including the type of cellular
stimulation used, possible differences in the uniporter complex
composition between fibroblasts and neurons, and adaptation
mechanisms that might come into play with a complete loss of
MICU1 versus a tissue-specific silencing. Additional studies
are required to resolve the basis for these differences. Prior
studies of genes involved in Drosophila olfactory classical con-
ditioning have revealed the utility of the fly in identifying behav-
iorally relevant genes in humans, although the difference in
complexity of the two systems precludes expecting a precise
correspondence in phenotypes. As one example, the classic
mutant dunce in Drosophila encodes a cAMP phosphodies-
terase and its disruption impairs olfactory learning after classical
conditioning (Davis, 2005) while the human homologs of dunce
are involved in mood regulation and psychiatric disorders (Hen-
kel-Tigges and Davis, 1990; Millar et al., 2005). Our study thus of-
fers guidance in further pursuit of understanding mitochondrial
uniporter function, neuronal development, and adult cognition.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Fly Stocks and Behavior
Fly stocks were raised on standard food at room temperature. The stocks used
in this study are listed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Fly
crosses were maintained at 25�C with �70% relative humidity on a 12 hr
light:12 hr dark cycle. For olfactory aversive conditioning, experiments were
performed as already described (Walkinshaw et al., 2015). Additional details
are available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Functional Mitochondrial Calcium Imaging
Brains from 5-day-old flies were dissected and perfused with a saline solution
(124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 5 mM
NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM trehalose, 7 mM sucrose, 10 mM glucose;
pH 7.2 at 25�C). KCl stimulation was performed by perfusing brains with the
appropriate concentration of KCl made in saline solution. Additional details
are available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Immunohistochemistry and Image Analysis
For
all
immunohistochemistry
experiments,
we
followed
the
protocol
described by Jenett et al. (2012). Additional details are available in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Single Neuron Structural Analyses
Photoactivation experiments were performed using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal
microscope equipped with a Chameleon Vision S Ti:S laser (Coherent) tuned at
710 nm. Five-day-old fly brains were dissected and positioned in a chamber
filled with saline (above). The cell body of a single MBn was identified using
a 253 water immersion objective. An ROI of 1 mm diameter was designated
at the center of the cell body and C3PA-GFP was photoactivated by the
710 nm Ti:S laser. The photoactivation protocol consisted of three line scans
of the ROI followed by a 2-min pause to allow GFP diffusion. This protocol
was repeated 30 times. The Ti:S laser power was adjusted to an output power
of 20–40 mW measured at the objective. After photoactivation, the MBn axonal
projections were imaged using a 633 objective and a 488 nm Argon laser.
Total neuron length and the number of nodes were measured using the
‘‘Branched structure analysis’’ function of Neurolucida Explorer (MBF
Bioscience) while field volume of axonal projections was calculated using
the ‘‘Convex Hull analysis’’ function.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Memory scores
follow a normal distribution (Walkinshaw et al., 2015) and were thus analyzed
by two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t test. For multiple group comparisons,
we used one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison test. Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used when multiple
groups were compared to the same control. For experiments other than
behavioral, we first assessed normality of the data using the D’Agostino and
Pearson test. The Mann-Whitney test was used when the assumption of
normality was not possible.
