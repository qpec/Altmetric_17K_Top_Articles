Malignant brain tumors are devastating despite aggressive treatments such as surgical
resection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The average life expectancy of patients
with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is approximately ∼18 months. It is clear that
increased survival of brain tumor patients requires the design of new therapeutic
modalities, especially those that enhance currently available treatments and/or limit
tumor growth. One novel therapeutic arena is the metabolic dysregulation that results
in an increased need for glucose in tumor cells. This phenomenon suggests that a
reduction in tumor growth could be achieved by decreasing glucose availability, which
can be accomplished through pharmacological means or through the use of a high-
fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD). The KD, as the name implies, also provides
increased blood ketones to support the energy needs of normal tissues. Preclinical
work from a number of laboratories has shown that the KD does indeed reduce
tumor growth in vivo. In addition, the KD has been shown to reduce angiogenesis,
inflammation, peri-tumoral edema, migration and invasion. Furthermore, this diet can
enhance the activity of radiation and chemotherapy in a mouse model of glioma, thus
increasing survival. Additional studies in vitro have indicated that increasing ketones
such as β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) in the absence of glucose reduction can also inhibit
cell growth and potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Thus, while we are
only beginning to understand the pluripotent mechanisms through which the KD affects
tumor growth and response to conventional therapies, the emerging data provide strong
support for the use of a KD in the treatment of malignant gliomas. This has led to a
limited number of clinical trials investigating the use of a KD in patients with primary and
recurrent glioma.

INTRODUCTION
Human malignant glioma is a uniformly fatal disease due, in part, to the limitations of currently
available treatments which include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Average survival
of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is 1.5 years, and tumors of the central nervous
system are the most common solid tumor in the pediatric population. It is therefore of paramount

importance that new therapeutic strategies for brain cancer
patients be developed, especially those that can enhance the
efficacy of current treatment options without damaging normal
brain tissue. Advances in our understanding of the biology of
these tumors have led to an increase in the number of targeted
therapies in preclinical and clinical trials (Roesler et al., 2010;
Nicholas et al., 2011; Niyazi et al., 2011). While these therapies
may prove somewhat effective, the heterogeneity of this tumor
often precludes the targeted molecules from being found on all
cells in the tumor thus reducing the efficacy of these treatments.
In contrast, one trait shared by virtually all tumor cells is altered
metabolism.
TUMOR METABOLISM
Alterations in the metabolism of cancer cells, what we now call
the ‘‘Warburg effect’’ or aerobic glycolysis, was first described
by Warburg et al. (1927). Cancer cells use glycolysis to
provide energy and biomolecules regardless of the availability
of oxygen. This results in the production of fewer ATP
molecules per molecule of glucose, and thus tumor cells
require large amounts of glucose. This shift towards increased
glycolytic flux in the cytosol and away from the tricarboxylic
acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria
occurs very early in tumorigenesis. This allows for a rapid
cell proliferation even under conditions of hypoxia and in
the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria. Since Warburg’s
discovery, metabolism has been of interest in the cancer field but
it was often overshadowed by discoveries of oncogenes, tumor
suppressor genes, growth factor pathways, molecular subtypes
of cancers, etc. There is a resurgence of interest in metabolism
as a central theme in cancer, and we continue to find that
metabolic pathways intersect and often regulate key components
of tumor initiation, progression and therapy response (Clark
et al., 2016; Pavlova and Thompson, 2016). In fact, altered
metabolism itself has been referred to as a hallmark of cancer
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Cantor and Sabatini, 2012; Ward
and Thompson, 2012) in addition to being involved in virtually
all of the cancer hallmarks described in the seminal article by
Hanahan and Weinberg (2011) (Figure 1; Lewis and Abdel-
Haleem, 2013).
The term ‘‘metabolic remodeling’’ has been used to describe
metabolic changes that can occur in cancer cells (Obre and
Rossignol, 2015), and oncogene associated pathways are now
known to intersect with, and alter metabolic pathways. For
example, the tumor suppressor protein p53 which plays a
pivotal role in the cellular responses to hypoxia, DNA damage
and oncogene activation is now known to regulate glycolysis
and assist in maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Olovnikov
et al., 2009; Madan et al., 2011; Puzio-Kuter, 2011; Kim
and Kim, 2013; Iurlaro et al., 2014; Barron et al., 2016).
Another important connection between metabolism and tumor
growth is through regulation of c-MYC. Over-expression
of c-MYC occurs in a wide variety of cancers including
gliomas. c-MYC is a multi-functional transcription factor
and the list of its target genes include those involved in
both cell proliferation and cell metabolism (Miller et al.,
2012; Zwaans and Lombard, 2014; Altman et al., 2015;
Hsieh et al., 2015; Stine et al., 2015). In addition to
stimulating glycolysis, c-MYC has been found to activate
glutaminolysis and lipid synthesis from citrate (Obre and
Rossignol, 2015).
With the advent of molecular analyses, studies of growth
factor pathways seemed to overshadow the influence of
metabolism on cancer growth. Over-activation of the stress
responsive PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is typical in many
cancers and often due to activation of growth factor signaling
pathways involved in glioma growth such as platelet-derived
growth factor, epidermal growth factor and insulin growth
factor. We now know that these growth factor pathways are
intertwined with metabolic signally pathways (Iurlaro et al.,
2014; Martini et al., 2014; Courtnay et al., 2015; Dibble
and Cantley, 2015; Roberts and Miyamoto, 2015). PI3K/AKT
signaling has been closely linked to metabolism and under
low glucose conditions results in rapid tumor cell death
(Robey and Hay, 2009; Yang et al., 2009; Marie and Shinjo,
2011).
Another important ‘‘hub’’ linking metabolism and cancer is
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 expression is activated
by hypoxia, which is typically found in high grade gliomas
and other cancers. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor
that induces the transcription of a variety of genes involved in
angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
other cytokines) in an attempt to improve tissue perfusion. This
results in the formation of abnormal blood vessels that can
increase inflammation and edema in brain tumors, as well as
induction of the transcription of a variety of genes that promote
invasion, migration and tumor growth (Fischer et al., 2002; Kaur
et al., 2005; Fujiwara et al., 2007; Hayashi et al., 2007; Mou et al.,
2010; Horing et al., 2012; Proescholdt et al., 2012; Yang et al.,
2012; Masson and Ratcliffe, 2014; Justus et al., 2015). In addition
to specific actions that relate to the tumor cell’s response to
oxygen availability, HIF-1 interacts with the PI3K/AKT signaling
path to act as a regulator of cancer metabolism, proliferation and
glycolysis (Pore et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2013; Courtnay et al.,
2015; Justus et al., 2015). It also affects the activation of nuclear
factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a transcriptional activator that is central
to the regulation of various signal transduction pathways and
to transcriptional activation events that mediate inflammation,
cell proliferation, cell migration and angiogenesis. HIF-1 may,
at least in part, provide the molecular basis for the Warburg
effect by ‘‘reprograming’’ cellular metabolism in response to
oxygen availability (Corbet and Feron, 2015; Courtnay et al.,
2015). HIF-1 also is a central figure in alterations to the tumor
microenvironment which not only affects tumor cell growth, but
also response to therapy (Yamada et al., 1999; Joon et al., 2004;
Amberger-Murphy, 2009; Dewhirst, 2009; Hattingen et al., 2011;
Metallo et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2012; Danhier et al., 2013; Justus
et al., 2015).
It is clear that cancer cell metabolism is far more complex than
originally thought. A number of cancer associated mutations
affect metabolism and defects in mitochondria are seen in
cancer that also link metabolism with cancer initiation and
progression. Recent studies have shown that changes in cellular

Abdel-Haleem, 2013).
metabolism can alter the expression of specific microRNAs and
promote epigenetic changes in tumor cells (Arora et al., 2015;
Bishop and Ferguson, 2015; Chan et al., 2015). Although
some of these interactions are mentioned above, in-depth
discussions of all of the interactions that occur between cancer
and metabolism are beyond the scope of this review and the
reader is referred to a number of reviews on these subjects
(Gatenby and Gillies, 2004; Vander Heiden et al., 2009; Cantor
and Sabatini, 2012; Ward and Thompson, 2012; Semenza,
2013; Gaude and Frezza, 2014; Masson and Ratcliffe, 2014;
Boroughs and DeBerardinis, 2015; Casey et al., 2015; Robey
et al., 2015; Asati et al., 2016; Barron et al., 2016; Bost et al.,
2016; Molon et al., 2016; Pavlova and Thompson, 2016; Pérez-
Escuredo et al., 2016). The fact that metabolic dysregulation
is seen in virtually all tumor cells has led to suggestions
that a promising therapeutic strategy may be to exploit this
feature. One potential way to achieve this goal is through the
use of the therapeutic ketogenic diet (KD) or physiologically
similar methods, such as caloric restriction (CR) or intermittent
fasting.
THE KETOGENIC DIET: OVERVIEW AND
PRECLINICAL EVIDENCE
The KD is a high-fat low protein/carbohydrate diet used to
treat refractory epilepsy (Kim and Rho, 2008; Cross, 2013).
It has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and there
are now studies to determine its efficacy for a number of
neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease, sleep disorders, headache, traumatic brain
injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pain and autism (Masino
and Ruskin, 2013; Gano et al., 2014). The KD increases

blood ketones and decreases blood glucose by simulating the
physiological response to fasting, thus leading to high rates
of fatty acid oxidation and an increase in the production
of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). When the amount of
acetyl-CoA exceeds the capacity of the tricarboxylic acid
cycle to utilize it, there is an increase in the production of
the ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate
(ACA), which can be used as an energy source in the
normal brain (Veech et al., 2001; Cahill and Veech, 2003;
Vanitallie and Nufert, 2003; Morris, 2005; Gasior et al.,
2006). Since normal cells readily use ketones as an alternate
energy source, they are unlikely to be adversely affected by
reduced glucose. In contrast, the metabolic alterations found
in cancer cells are generally thought to reduce their ability
to be ‘‘flexible’’ regarding their primary energy source, and
thus they require glucose (Tisdale and Brennan, 1983; Seyfried
and Mukherjee, 2005; Zhou et al., 2007; Maurer et al., 2011;
Seyfried et al., 2011; Seyfried, 2012). By reducing the glucose
availability to cancer cells and providing ketones as an alternative
energy source for normal cells, the KD may target the
Warburg Effect in highly glycolytic tumors, such as malignant
gliomas.
The use of metabolic alteration for the therapy of brain tumors
has been championed by Seyfried et al. (2011). They used the
VM (Shelton et al., 2010) and CT-2A (Marsh et al., 2008) mouse
tumor models to show that a KD, especially when given in
restricted amounts, extends survival. D’Agostino and co-workers
have added hyperbaric oxygen and ketone supplementation to
demonstrate reduced tumor cell growth and metastatic spread
in the VM metastatic tumor model (Poff et al., 2014, 2015). We
used the syngeneic intracranial GL261-luc/albino C57/Bl6 model
to demonstrate that CR was not necessary for the anti-tumor
effects of the KD (Stafford et al., 2010), particularly when a
4:1 fat:carbohydrate plus protein formulation is used (Scheck
et al., 2012; Woolf et al., 2015; Lussier et al., 2016). Recently
Martuscello et al. (2016) demonstrated inhibition of glioma stem
cell growth in vitro and in vivo through the use of a supplemented
high fat low carbohydrate diet.
The KD and similar diets used as a monotherapy have a
pluripotent effect on the growth on tumors both in vitro and
in vivo which may depend, at least in part, on the model
system, the specific metabolic intervention and the molecular
underpinnings of the tumor itself (Freedland et al., 2008; Otto
et al., 2008; Mavropoulos et al., 2009; Stafford et al., 2010;
Kim H. S. et al., 2012; Caso et al., 2013; Poff et al., 2013,
2015; Simone et al., 2013; Lv et al., 2014; Shukla et al., 2014;
Hao et al., 2015; Woolf et al., 2015). In addition, the exact
composition of the diet may also alter its effects, and there are
studies in some cancers looking specifically at polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly the omega-3 class, for their
anti-cancer properties (Sauer et al., 2007; Pifferi et al., 2008;
Wang et al., 2012, 2016; Hofmanova et al., 2013; Abel et al.,
2014). The striking feature of the work done to date in a number
of model systems using different dietary interventions is that
alterations in metabolism have a far reaching effect on tumor
cells, tumors and the tumor microenvironment. Studies have
shown reductions in growth rate as one might expect however,
there are also changes in the formation of reactive oxygen species
and oxidative stress (Stafford et al., 2010; Milder and Patel,
2012; Allen et al., 2013), angiogeneisis (Zhou et al., 2007; Jiang
and Wang, 2013; Woolf et al., 2015), hypoxia (Maurer et al.,
2011; Poff et al., 2015; Woolf et al., 2015), inflammation and
peri-tumoral edema (Mavropoulos et al., 2009; Woolf et al.,
2015), metastasis and invasion (Gluschnaider et al., 2014; Lv
et al., 2014; Hao et al., 2015; Poff et al., 2015) and the expression of
various transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulators such
as NF-κB (Woolf et al., 2015) and microRNAs (Pazmandi et al.,
2015).
KD IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD
THERAPIES
Although evidence suggests that the KD provides anti-tumor
benefits on its own, perhaps the most effective use of the KD is
in combination with standard cancer therapies such as radiation
and chemotherapy (Allen et al., 2014). The KD greatly enhanced
survival in a mouse model of malignant glioma when combined
with temozolomide (TMZ) when compared to either treatment
alone (Figure 2; Scheck et al., 2011). Using a bioluminescent,
syngeneic intracranial model of malignant glioma, the KD
was shown to significantly potentiate the anti-tumor effect of
radiotherapy. In fact, 9 out of 11 animals maintained on the KD
and treated with radiation had complete and sustained remission
of their implanted tumors, even after being switched back to a
standard rodent diet (Figure 2; Abdelwahab et al., 2012). Allen
et al. (2013) reported similar results when the KD is combined
with radiation and chemotherapy in a lung cancer xenograft
model. That is, they found decreased tumor growth rate and
increased survival. CR and short-term fasting have also been
found to be synergistic with radiation and other anti-cancer
therapeutics in both preclinical and clinical studies (Raffaghello
et al., 2008, 2010; Lee et al., 2010, 2012; Safdie et al., 2012; Champ
et al., 2013, 2014; Saleh et al., 2013; Klement and Champ, 2014).
The effectiveness of radiation therapy is due to a number
of factors including relative damage done to tumor cells vs.
normal tissue and the ability of normal cells and tumor cells to
repair the damage (Klement and Champ, 2014; Santivasi and
Xia, 2014). KD or CR may modulate the ability of tumor and
normal cells to repair radiation-induced damage (Klement and
Champ, 2014). Studies have shown that CR can enhance DNA
repair in normal cells (Heydari et al., 2007); however, this may
not be the case in tumor cells, and the differential response of
tumor cells and normal cells to genotoxic stress may be mediated
by reduced Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and glucose in
the tumor cells. We and others have shown that insulin growth
factor is reduced in animals maintained on a KD (Freedland et al.,
2008; Mavropoulos et al., 2009; Scheck et al., 2012; Klement and
Champ, 2014).
Finally, ketones and the KD have been shown to affect the
immune system (Kim D. Y. et al., 2012; Husain et al., 2013;
Rahman et al., 2014; Youm et al., 2015), and we have shown
that the KD also reverses tumor-mediated immune suppression
in a mouse model of malignant glioma (Lussier et al., 2016). As
radiation-induced tumor killing is known to expose the immune

system to a greater diversity of tumor antigens, it is possible that
the KD as an adjuvant works to augment the effect of radiation
in part by enhancing immunity against GBM.
The variety of effects seen when glucose in lowered and/or
ketones are increased suggests that this may also potentiate other
therapies, including newer immune- and targeted therapies.
Concerns that potentiation of the anti-tumor effect of a particular
therapy may also increase its effect on normal brain are valid;
however, we and others have shown that the gene expression
changes seen in tumor are different than those seen in normal
brain (Stafford et al., 2010; Maurer et al., 2011). Further, the
KD is known to have neuroprotective effects (Puchowicz et al.,
2008; Lund et al., 2009; Maalouf et al., 2009; Hartman, 2012)
and thus it has been postulated that this may actually help to
protect the normal brain from the deleterious effects of radio
and chemotherapy. Taken together, the preclinical data provides
strong support for the clinical use of the KD or CR as an adjuvant
therapy for the treatment of gliomas and other cancers.
β-HYDROXYBUTYRATE AS AN
ANTI-CANCER AGENT
The ketone body βHB has traditionally been thought of as
simply a metabolic substrate that replaces glucose during the KD,
fasting or exercise; however, the effects of increased ketones go
beyond simple considerations of energy availability (Newman
and Verdin, 2014; Jaworski et al., 2016). In vitro investigations
demonstrated that βHB is able to recapitulate, in part, the in vivo
effects of the full KD (Skinner et al., 2009; Rossi et al., 2015). This
suggests that the ketone bodies themselves possess antitumor
effects, and that perhaps the effects of the KD are mediated, at
least in part, by the ketone bodies. Additional evidence for this
comes from data showing that the use of ketone supplementation
can enhance the effects of the KD and may even be effective in
some diseases when used alone (Veech, 2004, 2014; Kashiwaya
et al., 2013; Poff et al., 2014; Shukla et al., 2014; Newport et al.,
2015; Youm et al., 2015). Though the mechanisms are still under
investigation, it is known that βHB is an endogenous Class I and
IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (Shimazu et al., 2013).
HDACs primarily functions by deacetylating lysine residues on
both histone and non-histone proteins, resulting in increased
global acetylation and regulation of gene expression. In this way,
βHB has the capacity to modulate the epigenetic environment
within cells, which may contribute to the beneficial effect of the
KD and CR.
Our own investigations into the interactions between βHB
and glioblastoma cells have revealed insights into the molecular
basis for some of the KD’s effects, most notably its radio-
and chemo-sensitizing effects. In vitro studies using βHB
demonstrated that, even in the presence of high glucose,
physiologically relevant doses of βHB reduced proliferation
of several human glioblastoma cell lines, two human cancer
stem cell lines, and a murine glioma cell line. Additionally,
similar treatment with βHB resulted in potentiation of low doses
of ionizing radiation therapy in both sensitive and resistant
populations (Rossi et al., 2015; Silva-Nichols et al., 2015). Further,
in a separate study βHB potentiated the chemotherapeutic
agent 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1 nitrosourea (BCNU, carmustine)
in a cell line derived from a recurrent human glioblastoma
(Scheck et al., 2012). Taken together, these results suggest that
ketone supplementation may provide an effective, less stringent
alternative to the rigors of the KD; yet additional studies are
needed to further develop this approach.
KD IN HUMANS
Studies of glucose utilization in cancer go back prior to the
1980s, including studies of metabolism and cancer cachexia
(Tisdale et al., 1987; Fearon et al., 1988). These and other studies

suggested that the KD consisting of a high percentage of medium
chain triglycerides (MCT) along with various supplements
resulted in weight gain and improved nitrogen balance in both
animals and humans. Nebeling et al. (1995) published a case
report in which they used a similar KD based on MCT oil to
treat two female pediatric patients with advanced stage malignant
brain tumors (Nebeling and Lerner, 1995). They demonstrated
that dietary induced ketosis decreased the availability of glucose
to the tumor without causing a decrease in patient weight
or overall nutritional status. Furthermore, both children had
long-term tumor management (Nebeling et al., 1995).
The 2nd case report was published by Zuccoli et al. (2010).
This patient was a 65-year-old female with a multicentric
glioblastoma. She was put on a 4:1 (ratio of fats:carbohydrate plus
protein) calorie restricted (600 kcal/day) KD during radiation
and chemotherapy. During this time her body weight dropped by
20%, she had reduced blood glucose, increased urinary ketones
and, most importantly, no observable brain tumor by either
fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET)
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The tumor recurred
10 weeks after the patient resumed her normal eating habits and
she succumbed to her disease less than 2 years after diagnosis.
While this patient did not experience long-term tumor control
after cessation of the diet, this report demonstrated that the
diet could be tolerated, even when used in a calorie-restricted
setting. Results of a phase 1 clinical trial were reported in
2011 by a German group (Schmidt et al., 2011). Tolerability
of a restricted calorie KD was tested in 16 patients with a
variety of advanced (end-stage) cancers. There were no severe
side effects and 5 of the 16 patients were able to complete
the 3 months treatment. These five patients had stable disease
while on the diet. Two of the 11 remaining patients died early
following the beginning of the trial, one was unable to tolerate
the diet and dropped out immediately, two patients dropped
out for personal reasons, one was unable to continue the diet
for more than a month and three had disease progression

within less than 2 months of starting the diet and one dropped
out to resume chemotherapy. While this trial demonstrated
tolerability and favorable side effect profile, the antitumor
efficacy could not be assessed due to the variety and severity of
disease in the patients. Recently, Schwartz et al. (2015) reported
on two patients with recurrent GBM treated with a calorie
restricted KD as a monotherapy and although the diet was
tolerated, both patients showed tumor progression—The first
within 4 weeks and the second within 12 weeks of beginning
the protocol. This group also hypothesized that an analysis
of ketolytic and glycolytic enzyme levels in tumor tissue may
help identify patients that are more likely to respond to a
KD, although this has not yet been proven. More recently,
a number of prospective clinical trials have been initiated
which have been summarized in Table 1. These trials include
studies of up-front treatment using the KD in addition to
standard radiation and chemotherapy in patients diagnosed
with GBM.
The case reports described above along with numerous
anecdotal reports suggest that the KD may be a promising
anti-cancer therapy; however, more work is needed to determine
how to best utilize this, and other metabolic therapies for the
treatment of tumors. Most of the information regarding the
best way to use the KD comes from the epilepsy literature.
Further research is needed to determine optimum blood ketone
and glucose levels for anticancer effects. In addition, a variety
of KDs are used for seizure control and it is not clear if
one or more of the different formulations will provide the
best results for cancer patients. Finally, while the KD has a
long record of safety in the epilepsy community, side effects
that occur when used in combination with cancer therapies
may differ in type or severity. This data will come from
carefully controlled clinical trials that include input from
registered dietitians well-versed in the use of the KD. Patient
enrollment into clinical trials requires ‘‘buy-in’’ from the medical
community. Physicians must be educated on the therapeutic
benefits of metabolic alteration as an adjuvant therapy. As with
any decision regarding therapy, the patient’s overall condition,
including nutritional status, must be taken into account. As
suggested by Klement and Champ (2014), cancer patients
should be assessed for nutritional needs and tolerability of such
interventions.
Concern about patients’ quality of life is sometimes given
as a reason not to employ KD. Compliance can be made more
difficult by the use of steroids (prescribed for peritumoral edema)
that often increase hunger and raise blood glucose levels. To
address this, at least one clinical trial (NCT02046187) includes
an analysis of both patient and caregiver quality of life. Quality
of life measurements are being added to more clinical trials, as
the importance of this has become recognized at the national
level (van den Bent et al., 2011; Boele et al., 2013; Dirven
et al., 2014). While some clinicians are concerned compliance
will reduce quality of life, the patient’s that do remain on
the KD often comment that this allows them to participate in
their own therapy. Despite these caveats, the existing preclinical
data suggesting anti-tumor efficacy and a synergistic effect
with standard therapies provides a strong impetus to conduct
controlled clinical trials, particularly those that will shed light on
the interactions between the KD and other therapies.
CONCLUSION
Improvements in the survival and quality of life for patients
with malignant brain tumors require the implementation of
new therapeutic modalities, especially those that increase the
efficacy of current therapies without increasing toxic side effects.
While the rapid accumulation of data defining the molecular
and genetic aberrations present in these tumors has suggested
a host of targets for the development of new therapies, targeted
therapies tried to date have met with limited success. This is at
least in part due to the molecular heterogeneity of these tumors
that prevents any one target from being present on all cells.
In contrast, metabolic dysregulation is present in virtually all
tumor cells and there is increased interest in using metabolic
therapies such as the KD and ketone supplementation for the
treatment of various cancers, especially brain tumors. Preclinical
data has demonstrated that the anti-tumor effects of the KD
and CR are multi-faceted, and alterations in energy metabolism
can inhibit cancer cell growth and increase the tumor’s response
to therapy. This provides a strong impetus to continue work
designed to elucidate the mechanisms through which the KD
exerts its anticancer effects, as well as suggesting the need for the
design of controlled clinical trials that will shed light on the most
effective way to implement metabolic therapies in combination
with standard therapies for the treatment of malignant disease.
This is a novel therapeutic paradigm, and we have only begun to
scratch the surface of its potential.
