Background: Interpersonal firearm violence among youth is a
substantial public health problem, and emergency department
(ED) physicians require a clinical screening tool to identify high-
risk youth.
Objective: To derive a clinically feasible risk index for firearm
violence.
Design: 24-month prospective cohort study.
Setting: Urban, level 1 ED.
Participants: Substance-using youths, aged 14 to 24 years,
seeking ED care for an assault-related injury and a proportion-
ately sampled group of non–assault-injured youth enrolled from
September 2009 through December 2011.
Measurements: Firearm violence (victimization/perpetration)
and validated questionnaire items.
Results: A total of 599 youths were enrolled, and presence/
absence of future firearm violence during follow-up could be
ascertained in 483 (52.2% were positive). The sample was ran-
domly split into training (75%) and post–score-construction vali-
dation (25%) sets. Using elastic-net penalized logistic regression,
118 baseline predictors were jointly analyzed; the most predic-
tive variables fell predominantly into 4 domains: violence victim-
ization, community exposure, peer influences, and fighting. By
selection of 1 item from each domain, the 10-point SaFETy (Se-
rious fighting, Friend weapon carrying, community Environment,
and firearm Threats) score was derived. SaFETy was associated
with firearm violence in the validation set (odds ratio [OR], 1.47
[95% CI, 1.23 to 1.79]); this association remained (OR, 1.44 [CI,
1.20 to 1.76]) after adjustment for reason for ED visit. In 5 risk
strata observed in the training data, firearm violence rates in the
validation set were 18.2% (2 of 11), 40.0% (18 of 45), 55.8% (24
of 43), 81.3% (13 of 16), and 100.0% (6 of 6), respectively.
Limitations: The study was conducted in a single ED and
involved substance-using youths. SaFETy was not externally
validated.
Conclusion: The SaFETy score is a 4-item score based on clini-
cally feasible questionnaire items and is associated with firearm
violence. Although broader validation is required, SaFETy shows
potential to guide resource allocation for prevention of firearm
violence.

F
irearm violence has been identified by health and
legal professionals as a critical public health prob-
lem (1). Homicide is the third leading cause of death in
the United States among youth aged 15 to 24 years,
with more than 86% of these deaths due to firearms (2).
Furthermore, firearm violence results in substantial
monetary cost; for example, medical and work-loss
costs of nonfatal firearm injuries treated in U.S. emer-
gency departments were estimated to exceed $2.9 bil-
lion in 2010 (3). Mitigating this public health issue
requires novel hospital and community-based interven-
tions that are focused on at-risk youth, especially those
in urban communities. Urban emergency departments
(EDs) have been identified as a critical access point for
identifying and intervening with such youth (4). Firearm
violence encompasses interpersonal, self-directed, and
unintentional firearm-related incidents, but in this study
we focus on interpersonal firearm violence, which we
refer to simply as “firearm violence” throughout.
Although previous ED-based research (5) has iden-
tified risk factors associated with firearm violence in-
volvement among high-risk youth, the field of hospital
and ED-based youth violence prevention programs
lacks a short, clinically relevant screening tool that can
be applied as part of routine clinical care in urban set-
tings. Such a tool could play a key role in determining
where to focus prevention or intervention efforts. Youth
identified during an ED visit, particularly violently in-
jured youth, are at elevated risk for future firearm vio-
lence (5) and thus would benefit most from early inter-
vention, including case management and therapeutic
services. Previous screening tools for youth violence
(6–8) primarily focused on primary care settings, lack a
specific focus on firearm violence, or are too lengthy for
practical use in a busy ED setting. Furthermore, re-
search on the construction of violence screening tools
(6, 8) has been limited by small sample sizes and has
not considered out-of-sample predictive power in de-
vising the screen. Developing an ED/hospital-based
clinical screening tool that is focused on assessing risk
for future firearm violence will enable ED and hospital
health systems to better focus prevention resources on
patients at the highest risk.
In the current study, we seek to develop a clinical
screening tool for future risk for firearm violence by ex-

 amining data collected as part of a 2-year prospective
study of youth aged 14 to 24 years seeking ED care.
First, we used machine learning methods to determine
which variables measured at the baseline of a 2-year
longitudinal study were most predictive of future fire-
arm violence. Second, on the basis of breadth and clin-
ical feasibility, we selected 4 items from among the
most predictive variables. Third, we developed cut-
points and assigned point values to each level based
on their relative effects, resulting in the SaFETy (Serious
fighting, Friend weapon carrying, community Environ-
ment, and firearm Threats) score. Finally, we examined
the relationship between the SaFETy score and rates of
future firearm violence within training and internal vali-
dation data sets.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
Data were collected during the Flint Youth Injury
study (9–11), a 2-year prospective cohort study of
assault-injured youth (age 14 to 24 years) with any drug
use in the past 6 months and a comparison group of
non–assault-injured, drug-using youth seeking ED care
at a level 1 trauma center in Flint, Michigan. The parent
study focused on service needs and utilization among
substance (predominantly marijuana) users. Although
this potentially limits generalizability, we note that most
youth who seek care for assault injuries in this setting
are substance users (9). Patients were recruited from
December 2009 through September 2011, 24 hours
per day on Thursday through Monday and from 5 a.m.
to 2 a.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday. Youth who
sought care for sexual assault, child abuse, suicidal ide-
ation or attempt, or any conditions that preclude con-
sent (such as altered mental status) were excluded. In-
stitutional review boards at the University of Michigan
and Hurley Medical Center approved the study. A Na-
tional Institutes of Health (NIH) Certificate of Confiden-
tiality (COC) was obtained.
Potential participants were ascertained through
electronic patient logs and approached by research as-
sistants in waiting or treatment areas. All assault-injured
youth, including those who were initially unstable but
stabilized with 72 hours of presentation, were ap-
proached and screened for study eligibility. In se-
quence, the next available age group (14 to 17, 18 to
20, and 21 to 24 years) and sex-matched, non–assault-
injured ED entrant was screened for the comparison
group. Those providing consent (or assent with paren-
tal consent for those younger than age 18 years) pri-
vately self-administered the screening survey using a
tablet device and received a $1.00 gift for participation.
Individuals who self-reported drug use in the past 6
months (98% used marijuana) were considered eligible
and consented to the subsequent 2-year longitudinal
study. Appendix Figure 1 (available at Annals.org)
shows a flow chart of the original study. Remunera-
tion was $20 for completion of a subsequent self-
administered baseline survey. Follow-up assessments
were conducted at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and par-
ticipants were compensated $35, $40, $40, and $50 for
each sequential follow-up. Baseline characteristics (9)
and 2-year outcomes (5, 10) are reported elsewhere.
Measures
The following measures were assessed:
The outcome variable was a binary indicator of fire-
arm violence (victimization, perpetration, firearm injury
requiring medical care, or firearm death) during the 24-
month follow-up period, ascertained through a com-
posite of self-report, medical chart review, and vital re-
cords databases (see Carter and colleagues [5] for
greater detail). Both peer and partner firearm violence
was included. Although the dynamics of peer and part-
ner violence differ, we justify combining them by noting
the large overlap between victims (12, 13) and perpe-
trators (14–16) of peer and partner violence.
Candidate predictor variables were taken from
baseline self-report surveys; in addition to age, sex, and
reason for ED visit (assault-injured/non–assault-injured),
we included 115 survey items. Other variables that
were measured but judged unlikely to be assessed ac-
curately and truthfully (for example, serious violence
perpetration) without an NIH Certificate of Confidenti-
ality were not considered. See the Supplement (avail-
able at Annals.org) for question wording and response
options for all items described below.
1. Violence items (13 items) from the National Lon-
gitudinal Study on Adolescent Health (17) captured the
frequency of received threats/violence, perpetrated
threats, fighting, and carrying a weapon while intoxi-
cated in the past 6 months.
2. Partner aggression (13 items) was assessed with
Conflict Tactics Scale items (18), which measured the
frequency of partner violence victimization in the past
6 months.
3. Nonpartner aggression (13 items) was assessed
with questions modified from the Conflict Tactics Scale
(18), measuring the frequency of nonpartner violence
victimization in the past 6 months.
4. Community violence exposure (5 items) included
assessment of the frequency of exposure to violence
and neighborhood crime in the past 6 months (19).
5. Mental health (12 items) was measured with the
Brief Symptom Inventory checklist (20), which assessed
severity of depression and anxiety in the past week.
6. Drug and alcohol efficacy (16 items) assessed
confidence in avoiding drug (8 items) or alcohol (8
items) use in various situations (21, 22).
7. Alcohol use (10 items) was assessed with the Al-
cohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), which
measures the frequency of alcohol consumption and
alcohol-related consequences in the past 6 months
(23, 24).
8. Peer influences (11 items) included items from
the Flint Adolescent Study (25) regarding the number
of friends providing positive (4 items) and negative (7
items) influences; positive items were reverse coded.
9. Parental behavior (10 items) included items from
the Flint Adolescent Study (25) assessing parental sup-

 port (6 items) and level of parental drug/alcohol use (4
items); parental support was reverse coded.
10. Retaliatory attitudes (7 items) included items as-
sessing willingness to engage in violent retaliation;
higher scores indicate greater willingness (26, 27).
11. Fight self-efficacy (5 items) assessed perceived
ability to avoid conflicts (28).
Statistical Analysis
We first randomly split the data into a training set
(75%) and a validation set (25%), ensuring that the
prevalence of firearm violence was equivalent in each.
In determining variable importance, developing cut-
points, and assigning point values, we used only the
training data. Multiple imputation by chained equations
(29), implemented in the R statistical software package
mice (29), was used to impute missing outcomes (there
were no missing values in the predictors measured at
baseline) for inclusion in the training data. Variable im-
portance analyses and determination of risk score con-
tributions were based on estimates pooled across 50
multiply imputed data sets.
To determine variable importance, we used elastic-
net penalized logistic regression, a common machine
learning approach to binary classification, which shrinks
the regression coefficient estimates to improve out-of-
sample prediction. The elastic net (30) penalizes both
the absolute value of the coefficients, which performs
automatic variable selection by shrinking irrelevant co-
efficients to zero (31), and the squared size of the coef-
ficient, which limits the effect of collinearity (32). The
elastic net is particularly applicable when the number
of predictors is large relative to the sample size and
when interest lies in variable selection wherein the ef-
fect of collinearity is reduced (30). To evaluate out-of-
sample prediction accuracy, we used leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV). In LOOCV, the model is fit to
the entire sample, minus 1 point, and is used to predict
the excluded case; this is repeated so each point is left
out once. The level of coefficient shrinkage that mini-
mizes the LOOCV error rate was chosen. Model fitting
and cross-validation were performed by using the R
statistical software package glmnet (33).
After determining the optimally penalized model,
we ranked predictor importance by using the size of
the standardized regression coefficient estimates. Us-
ing the variable importance rankings and the variable
domains, we selected 4 variables that were predictive
and covered distinct content. We justify the use of 4
items by noting that exploration with 3 item scores (not
shown) indicated that the 4-item score yielded a more
thorough risk gradient (in the training data), and this
was not notably improved by adding a fifth item; be-
cause clinical feasibility is paramount, item scores of 6
or more were not explored. Cut-points for each item
were chosen by cycling through all possible categori-
zations of each variable, fitting a logistic regression
model of future firearm violence (in the training set)
using the categorized variables, and choosing the cat-
egorization that minimized the finite-sample–corrected
Akaike information criteria (34). To avoid overfitting the
training data, a maximum of 3 categories were consid-
ered for each variable and overly small categories (<20
people) were not considered. Finally, we determined
score contributions by 1) entering the categorized pre-
dictors into a single logistic regression model and 2)
scaling by the minimum regression coefficient and
rounding to an integer (as in reference 35). Properties
of the risk score in the validation set (sensitivity, speci-
ficity, and odds ratio [OR] with firearm violence) were
examined and stratified by assault-injured/non–assault-
injured group.

RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
In
total,
599
youth
(349
assault-injured
and
250 non–assault-injured) participated in the study.
Follow-up rates were 85.3%, 83.7%, 84.2%, and 85.3%
at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Among participants, 483
(80.6%) could be definitively classified as having been
involved with firearm violence (n = 252 [52.2%]) or not
(n = 231 [47.8%]) during the follow-up period. Of the
participants, 57.3% were male and 62.5% were African
American; the average age at baseline was 19.9 years
(SD, 2.4 years); greater detail is published elsewhere
(36). One fourth of those with (n = 63) and those with-
out (n = 58) firearm violence were randomly removed
for post–score-construction validation; there were no
significant demographic differences between the train-
ing and validation data.
Variable Importance Analysis
Appendix Figure 2 (available at Annals.org) shows
the relative size of the top 20 largest standardized co-
efficients. Table 1 lists the selected items and their uni-
variate associations with firearm violence. Selected
items largely fell into 4 domains that were observed
post hoc: 1) violence victimization (peer and partner),
2) community violence exposure, 3) peer/family influ-
ences, and 4) fighting.
Risk Score Construction
We narrowed the 20 variables to 4 items from dif-
ferent domains to construct the SaFETy score. From vi-
olence victimization, we chose the highest-ranking
item: being threatened with a firearm. For practical use
this could be combined with the number 2–ranked and
number 9–ranked items into “threatened or shot you”
because of similar content. “Friend weapon carrying”
was chosen from the peer influence domain. Among
the community violence items, we chose the lower-
ranking item—frequency of hearing gunshots—because
of the greater likelihood of a truthful response in a clin-
ical setting (compared with the frequency of seeing
someone shot). Similarly, we chose “frequency of being
in a serious fight” over “frequency of putting someone
in the hospital” from the fighting domain.

 Table 2 shows the derived cut-points and weights
for each category, and how the selected items corre-
spond to the SaFETy mnemonic. “Received firearm
threats” was divided into “never,” “once,” and “2+
times”; “hearing gunshots” was divided into “less than
many times” and “many times”; “fight frequency” was
stratified into “never,” “1–5 times,” and “6+ times”; and
“friend weapon carrying” was collapsed into whether or
not “many, most, or all” friends carry weapons. The
largest weights corresponded to received firearm vio-
lence threats and high-frequency serious fighting.
Risk Score Performance
In the validation set, a 1-point increase in SaFETy
score corresponded to higher risk for firearm violence
(OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.23 to 1.79]). The area under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.73, indi-
cating reasonable out-of-sample discriminatory power.
The Figure shows the distribution of SaFETy scores
among those with and without firearm violence in the
validation set. Table 3 shows the sensitivity and speci-
ficity of SaFETy score in the validation set for each cut-
point between 0 and 10 (Appendix Table 1, available at
Annals.org, shows training sample results). Informal ex-
amination of the training data indicated 5 risk strata:
SaFETy scores of 0, 1 to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 8, and 9 to 10;
the same risk gradient is apparent in the validation set
(Appendix Figure 3, available at Annals.org), with each
level corresponding to future firearm violence rates of
18.2% (2 of 11), 40.0% (18 of 45), 55.8% (24 of 43),
81.3% (13 of 16), and 100.0% (6 of 6), respectively.
Sensitivity Analysis
Because membership in the assault-injured group
is itself associated with future firearm violence (Appen-
dix Tables 2 and 3, available at Annals.org), we present
several stratified analyses. First, we conducted an om-
nibus test comparing the model with all 20 of the top
variables that do versus do not allow the effects to vary
by
assault-injured/non–assault-injured
group,
which
yielded a nonsignificant result (P = 0.09). Appendix Ta-
bles 4 and 5 (available at Annals.org) show univariate
associations between each variable and firearm vio-
lence, stratified by assault-injured/non–assault-injured
group. Second, we estimated the joint effects of SaFETy
score and assault-injured group membership (Appen-
dix Table 3) and found that 1) with SaFETy score in-
cluded in the model, assault-injured group member-
ship was not significant and 2) the effect of SaFETy
score was similar after the inclusion of the assault-

 injured group. Appendix Tables 6 and 7 (available at
Annals.org) show frequency distributions of SaFETy
scores and sensitivity/specificity estimates, respectively,
stratified by assault-injured group (corresponding train-
ing sample results are shown in Appendix Tables 8 and
9, available at Annals.org).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we used machine learning
methods and data from a prospective cohort of ED pa-
tients to identify factors predictive of future firearm vio-
lence that could be incorporated into a brief clinical
screening tool for ED use. This data set is unique in that
high-risk urban youth were followed successfully over 2
years and that the interviews capture not only firearm
violence that resulted in injury but incidents that re-
sulted in near-injury (for example, being threatened
with a gun). SaFETy clearly defines a gradient for future
firearm violence risk in this population; this steady in-
crease (rather than a sharp increase at 1 point) inhibits
determination of a threshold with strong combined
sensitivity/specificity but creates a strong basis for allo-
cation of prevention resources.
Coupling risk stratification with effective prevention
tools is an important potential use of the SaFETy score.
Very-high-risk individuals (e.g., those with a SaFETy
score ≥6) may represent sensible candidates for entry
into resource-intensive programs (for example, 1-year
wraparound programs), whereas individuals in the mid-
dle range (a SaFETy score ≥1 but ≤5) may benefit from
graduated levels of targeted interventions designed to
interrupt a negative trajectory. Programs focusing on
primary prevention may be appropriate for lower-
scoring (a SaFETy score of 0) individuals. Although
SaFETy has predictive power among both assault-
injured and non–assault-injured youth, it is most appli-
cable among non–assault-injured youth because there
is no other current means of stratifying risk in that
group. Furthermore, given the excess risk for future vic-
timization among those presenting with assault injury,
particularly firearm injuries (37), prevention resources
should also be considered for this group, even among
those with low SaFETy scores. Previous violence pre-
vention programs have been shown to be cost-effective
(38–42), specifically with regard to the costs of treating
repeated violent injuries (38, 39) and preventing incar-
ceration due to violence-related offenses (38, 40).
Given that the average ED visit for a firearm assault
costs $1200 and average inpatient costs approach
$24 000 (43), even a moderately effective prevention
program directed at individuals in higher-risk strata
would be cost-effective.
The items selected for the screening tool confer
strong face validity to the data-derived prediction tool.
Two items—history of receiving gun threats and hearing
gun violence in one's community—confirm the impor-
tance of previous violence exposure in the risk for fu-
ture firearm violence. In addition, peer influences,
whose importance is most pronounced during the pe-
riod of adolescence and emerging adulthood (44), is
an important prognostic factor, in the form of friend
weapon carrying. The emergence of serious fighting as
a strong predictor agrees with prior violence screening
tools (7) and underscores the role of impulse control
and aggression in firearm violence. These results high-
light the broader importance of incorporating commu-
nity and peer factors into prevention programs, in ad-
dition to addressing psychological distress stemming

trauma-
informed care practices (45).
We also note that male sex, which is consistently
identified as a risk factor for gun violence (5, 46, 47),
was not predictive of future gun violence. This suggests
that sex differences in firearm violence risk may be sub-
sumed by other risk exposure (such as affiliation with
high-risk peers). Similarly, depression and anxiety were
not identified as important prognostic factors, suggest-
ing that their association with firearm violence may also
be largely subsumed by proximal exposures to high-
risk community violence. We note that self-reported
ability to understand another's point of view was highly
associated with future gun violence but was not se-
lected for the final screen because of concerns about
its accurate assessment and wording that may be mis-
understood in a brief clinical screen.
The results here are encouraging because they rely
only on items considered feasible to ascertain in a clin-
ical setting. The feasibility of screening on the basis of
such measures as “Have you shot someone in the last 6
months?” is limited when the respondents may not per-
ceive themselves as having the same degree of confi-
dentiality as in a clinical study with an NIH Certificate of
Confidentiality. In addition, that question is not likely to
be asked or answered in a way that is perceived as
nonjudgmental or nonincriminating by staff or patients.
Asking youth about peer behavior that they are more
likely to report—and is not incriminating—has been
done for other risk behavior tools, such as the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism alcohol
screening tool for adolescents (48). None of the mea-
sures selected specifically ask respondents to 1) incrim-
inate themselves, 2) incriminate any specific person, or
3) embarrass themselves. Although a superior predic-
tive tool may be derived by including a broader class of
measures, this gain may be offset by reduced willing-
ness to answer or response accuracy.
Our study had several limitations. First, our sample
is limited to a single urban ED; validation in other high-
risk populations is required. Second, the analytic sam-
ple is limited to drug-using youth. Although we cannot
ascertain the efficacy of this screen in non–drug-using
youth, we note that substance use has been linked to
both gun carrying (36) and violence (49) and that a
large majority of individuals screened into the study be-
cause of marijuana use. To mitigate this limitation, cli-
nicians could first inquire about marijuana use in the
past 6 months, a standard history and physical exami-
nation question. Alternatively, given the lack of valid
screening instruments for firearm violence and the
knowledge that this is the leading cause of death for
youth in urban communities, it would be clinically rea-
sonable to suggest that high-scoring urban youth, even
those who have not used marijuana in the past 6
months, warrant preventive services. However, future
research is needed to validate this tool among non–
substance-using youth.
Third, self-reported data were a large component
of identifying those with versus those without firearm
violence during the follow-up period, which is a con-
cern for underreporting of firearm violence. This limita-
tion is partly mitigated by the use of full validated
scales, such as the Conflict Tactics Scale (18), which
were privately administered on a tablet. Fourth, our
mental health assessments focused only on depression
and anxiety. Because such symptoms as suspicious-
ness, delusions, and extreme anger have been linked
to violence and gun carrying (50, 51), future work is
needed to assess their power to predict future gun vi-
olence. Finally, our missing-data imputation relies on
the untestable missing-at-random assumption. Noting
the high follow-up rate and that no covariates that
made up the SaFETy score differed significantly in
terms of missing versus nonmissing cases, the role of
nonrandom attrition was likely minimal.
In conclusion, we used machine learning methods
to determine the most important predictors of future

and without firearm violence during the follow-up period

 firearm violence in a high-risk ED sample. This is the
first scale to provide risk stratification for firearm vio-
lence and the first developed in and specifically for an
ED setting (rather than primary care). Previous risk
scores were developed to predict related but distinct
behaviors, such as nonspecific violent injury (6, 8) and
firearm carrying (7). The common thread between
SaFETy and previous scales is the importance of fight-
ing (6–8) and received threats (7) as prognostic factors.
The SaFETy instrument, which can be administered in 1
to 2 minutes, defines a gradient of future firearm vio-
lence risk that can be adapted to a variety of settings.
Emergency departments have been previously used as
opportunities for identifying high-risk individuals for
other types of violence (52, 53), but the current lack of
an easily administered screening tool for firearm vio-
lence has limited our ability to harness the same oppor-
tunity for firearm violence. Our results suggest that
SaFETy fills this gap.
