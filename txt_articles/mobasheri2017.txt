 Immunometabolism is an emerging field at the interface 
of immunology and metabolism, which, historically, 
have been considered distinct disciplines1,2. Focusing 
on changes in the intracellular metabolic pathways of 
immune cells, and how these alterations modulate cel-
lular function3, immunometabolism highlights the key 
role of metabolic reprogramming within the immune 
system in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic 
inflammatory diseases. Evidence suggests that six major 
metabolic pathways are involved in immunometab-
olism, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) 
cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), fatty acid 
 
oxidation, fatty acid synthesis and amino acid metab-
olism3. Changes in the levels of metabolites in these 
pathways act as important metabolic switches with 
the capacity to shape the ways in which immune cells 
respond to their environment.
Interest in this new field of research is steadily gain-
ing momentum owing to the discovery that underlying 
metabolic disturbances in obesity-induced inflamma-
tion, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus have 
the potential to promote a variety of chronic diseases 
and comorbidities1,4. Inflammatory diseases, includ-
ing osteoarthritis (OA) (which is now appreciated to 
involve low-grade inflammation), are associated with 
a sedentary lifestyle, physical inactivity, obesity and 
inflammaging; in OA, poor diet, obesity and physical 
inactivity directly contribute to metabolic changes 
that promote inflammaging and cellular senescence5,6 
(FIG. 1). According to the immunometabolic hypothesis, 
aberrant metabolism, inflammatory mediators and dis-
turbed circadian rhythms and biological clocks are inti-
mately involved in many inflammatory responses7. The 
ability to control and manipulate cellular metabolism 
could, therefore, lead to new approaches for treating 
inflammatory diseases.
Evidence is emerging for a key role for metabolism in 
the regulation of inflammatory responses and immune 
cell function, with different immune cells showing dis-
tinct metabolic signatures that regulate their biological 
responses8. However, the same principle can also be 
applied to many non-immune cell types. Under adverse 
conditions, most mammalian cells undergo a shift in 
energy metabolism from a resting regulatory state to 
a highly metabolically active state to maintain energy 
homeostasis and promote cell survival9. This metabolic 
shift normally occurs when oxygen levels are low, limit-
ing the metabolism of pyruvate by the tricarboxylic acid 
cycle in mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation. 
However, in some instances this shift can occur under 
aerobic conditions (known as the Warburg effect), as in 
cancer and many degenerative and inflammatory con-
ditions, and represents a potential threat to cell function 
and survival. Such a metabolic shift is now believed to 
occur in the articular cartilage, subchondral bone and 
synovium of the joints of patients with OA, influencing

Abstract | Metabolism is important for cartilage and synovial joint function. Under adverse 
microenvironmental conditions, mammalian cells undergo a switch in cell metabolism from  
a resting regulatory state to a highly metabolically activate state to maintain energy homeostasis. 
This phenomenon also leads to an increase in metabolic intermediates for the biosynthesis  
of inflammatory and degradative proteins, which in turn activate key transcription factors and 
inflammatory signalling pathways involved in catabolic processes, and the persistent 
perpetuation of drivers of pathogenesis. In the past few years, several studies have demonstrated 
that metabolism has a key role in inflammatory joint diseases. In particular, metabolism is 
drastically altered in osteoarthritis (OA) and aberrant immunometabolism may be a key feature of 
many phenotypes of OA. This Review focuses on aberrant metabolism in the pathogenesis of OA, 
summarizing the current state of knowledge on the role of impaired metabolism in the cells of the 
osteoarthritic joint. We also highlight areas for future research, such as the potential to target 
metabolic pathways and mediators therapeutically.

 Glycolysis

generates two molecules of 
pyruvate, ATP and NADH from 
every one molecule of glucose, 
supporting the tricarboxylic

intermediates for the pentose 
phosphate pathway, 
glycosylation reactions and the 
synthesis of biomolecules 
(including serine, glycine, 
alanine and acetyl-CoA).

ricarboxylic acid (TCA) 
cycle
(Also known as the Krebs 
cycle) A set of connected 
pathways in the mitochondrial

acid synthesis. 
the metabolic behaviour of chondrocytes, synoviocytes 
and bone cells, as well as their interactions with the 
immune system through synovial macrophages10. There 
is also increasing and overwhelming evidence to suggest 
that OA is a metabolic disorder11–13. In this Review, we 
focus on aberrant metabolism in OA, summarizing the 
current state of knowledge in this area by focusing on 
metabolic aspects of synovial joint tissue and cell func-
tion, and examining the evidence for deregulated metab-
olism in chondrocytes and synoviocytes in OA. We also 
propose priority areas for future research, in particular 
metabolic pathways in synovial fibroblasts and activated 
macrophages, about which little is currently known.
OA as a metabolic disorder
OA, an age-related low-grade inflammatory disease 
of the synovial joints14,15, is one of the most costly and 
disabling forms of arthritis, being more prevalent than 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other arthritic diseases 
and representing a major public health burden16. OA 
is characterized by the progressive deterioration of 
articular cartilage and structural changes to the entire 
synovial joint, including the synovium17, meniscus (in 
the knee)18, periarticular ligaments19, adipose tissue 
(for example, the infra 
patellar fat pad in the knee)20 
and subchondral bone21. These deleterious structural 
changes in articular tissues impair the functional 
integrity of the synovial joint22, adversely affecting its 
biomechanics and attenuating its already limited inher-
ent capacity for repair and regeneration23. Although OA 
was historically viewed as a ‘wear and tear’ disease, it is 
now generally accepted to be a low-grade inflammatory 
disease24,25 affecting the whole joint11,15,26,27. The patho-
genesis and progression of OA seem to be the result 
of the complex and dynamic interplay of mechanical, 
cellular and systemic molecular factors26. Many of the 
biochemical mediators involved in OA have important 
systemic and immunoregulatory roles28, including sev-
eral complement proteins that are implicated in low-
grade inflammation25, providing new evidence for key 
 
molecular and metabolic factors as drivers of OA.
Notably, OA is not a homogeneous disease but is 
in fact highly heterogeneous, characterized by a num-
ber of different phenotypes (including a distinct met-
abolic phenotype), each of which is thought to have 
different drivers (FIG. 2). The various phenotypes of OA 
have important differences, but are likely to share key 
elements such as ageing, biomechanical factors and 
metabolic alterations. Although this idea complicates 
traditional approaches for developing new treatments, 
it also presents opportunities for developing therapies 
targeted to each phenotype.
Preclinical research in animal models of OA and clin-
ical studies in patients with OA have shown that age14, 
obesity29 and metabolic syndrome30 are major risk factors 
for the development of OA11,31. Obesity is the strongest 
risk factor for disease onset in the knee32, and mechani-
cal factors (such as ambulatory load) dominate the risk 
for disease progression26,33. However, the fact that obese 
individuals have an increased risk of developing OA in 
non-weight-bearing joints such as the hands and wrists34 
suggests that factors produced by white adipose tissue 
(WAT) might have a role in the onset and/or progression 
of OA. Increased adiposity and dysfunction of WAT is 
closely related to the chronic low-grade inflammatory 
status that is a systemic feature of both obesity and 
OA35–37. A consequence of this dysfunction is that WAT 
adopts an atherogenic, diabetogenic and inflammatory 
profile, producing proinflammatory factors (known as 
adipokines) that promote inflammation and the deg-
radation of cartilage and thus affect the whole joint 
microenvironment38, including the activity of immune 
cells in patients with OA39. Accumulating evidence also 
points to the infrapatellar fat pad as another potential 
source of proinflammatory adipokines in the joint20. 
Chondrocytes, synoviocytes, adipocytes, macrophages 
and other types of cell in the fat pad are likely to col-
lectively contribute to the production of proinflam-
matory cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, tackling 
obesity29 and the underlying causes of metabolic syn-
drome30 through lifestyle changes (such as improved 
diet, increased physical activity and weight loss) has 
been proposed as a realistic and achievable approach for 
preventing OA and thus reducing its burden on society. 
However, a greater understanding of the important roles 
of biomechanical factors, joint injury, obesity and meta-
bolic syndrome in the pathogenesis of OA is required to 
reduce the effect of this disease on public health.

glycolysis with the conversion 
of glucose-6-phosphate to 
ribose 5-phosphate and 
generates the reducing

the synthesis of nucleotides 
and nucleic acids) and eryth-
rose-4-phosphosphate (used in

.
Oxidative phosphorylation
A metabolic pathway that 
produces ATP from the 
oxidation of acetyl-CoA and 
the transfer of electrons to the 
electron transport chain via 
NADH and FADH2. 
Metabolism in articular cartilage
Articular cartilage is hypocellular, avascular, aneural 
and alymphatic40. Despite its hypocellularity, cartilage 
is a metabolically active connective tissue with reduced 
access to oxygen and glucose compared with synovial 
fluid and plasma41, producing an environment that pre-
sents its few resident cells with a number of metabolic 
challenges. Consequently, the turnover of extracellular 
matrix (ECM) molecules in mature skeletal cartilage is 
extremely slow. For example, the turnover of proteo-
glycans (such as aggrecan) can take up to 25 years42 
and the half-life of type II collagen, the major fibrillary 
collagen in cartilage, is between 100 and 400 years43,44. 
Therefore, healthy cartilage with optimal ECM function 
requires the maintenance of a delicate balance between 
anabolic and catabolic activities, which is critical for 
long-term tissue integrity and the capacity for cartilage 
to repair itself45.
Glucose is an important metabolic fuel and structural 
precursor in cartilage, being vital for ECM synthesis and 
degradation46. It serves as a major energy substrate as well 
as being the main precursor for the synthesis of glycos-
aminoglycans in chondrocytes47 (FIG. 3). Facilitated glucose 
transport therefore represents the first rate- 
limiting step 
of glucose metabolism in chondrocytes48, which express 
several glucose transporter isoforms, some of which are 
regulated by hypoxia and proinflammatory cytokines41,48. 
Once glucose is transported into chondrocytes, it is 
metabolized via glycolysis and the TCA cycle or used as a 
structural component for the synthesis of glycoproteins. 
Under normal regulatory homeostatic conditions and 
physiological normoxia (such as the oxygen environment 
in healthy cartilage), one molecule of glucose is oxidized 
by glycolysis, generating two molecules of pyruvate, which 
enter the mitochondria. Pyruvate is then decarboxylated 
by pyruvate dehydrogenase and enters the TCA cycle, 
producing FADH2 and NADH, which donate electrons 
to the electron transport chain to generate 36 molecules of 
ATP per molecule of glucose by oxidative phosphorylation. 
 
Although chondrocytes rely primarily on glycolysis to 
meet their cellular energy requirements, they possess the 
metabolic flexibility to promote cell survival and sup-
port ECM biosynthesis during periods of nutrient stress 
by enhancing glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration 
through the TCA cycle49. Optimal mitochondrial func-
tion is therefore important for supporting the TCA cycle 
in healthy chondrocytes, and impaired mitochondrial 
function is implicated in OA pathogenesis49.
Altered metabolism in OA
In pathophysiological situations such as OA, cellular 
metabolism is compromised and there is an increase in 
the production of antianabolic, procatabolic and pro-
inflammatory factors14. The switch in metabolism that 
occurs to compensate for this compromised situation 
enables anabolic processes such as cell proliferation, pro-
tein biosynthesis, antigen presentation and phagocytosis 
still to occur in immune cells3. These anabolic processes 
equate to cell proliferation and protein biosynthesis in 
a variety of other cell types, including chondrocytes 
and other cells of the synovial joint. Indeed, emerging 
evidence suggests that in chondrocytes from patients with 
OA, proinflammatory pathways rely on energy generated 
by a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation 
 
to glycolysis50.
In healthy articular cartilage, chondrocytes have the 
metabolic flexibility to generate energy and promote 
cell survival during periods of  acute nutrient stress by 
upregulating mitochondrial respiration and reducing 
the rate of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species produc-
tion49. The metabolic adaptation of OA articular carti-
lage to new environmental conditions is evident in the 
early stages of the disease, when attempts to repair and 
regenerate the cartilage matrix have an increased likeli-
hood of success51. However, cartilage from patients with 
OA at a later stage of disease does not seem to have this 
metabolic flexibility51.
Cartilage and chondrocytes
The metabolic demands of fully differentiated and quies-
cent chondrocytes are very different from chondrocytes 
in an inflammatory microenvironment. Chondrocytes 
are highly glycolytic cells, which, like cancer cells, exhibit 
the ‘Warburg effect’ (also known as aerobic glyco 
lysis)52,53. 
We do not yet understand the full molecular composition 
of the ‘surfaceome’ and ‘membranome’ of chondrocytes, 
Figure 1 | Factors underlying metabolic alterations in 
osteoarthritis. Poor diet and lifestyle choices can 
contribute to weight gain and lead to obesity. Ageing, 
obesity and other co‑morbidities associated with 
osteoarthritis (OA) contribute to metabolic reprogramming 
in a variety of cells and tissues, leading to inflammaging 
and cellular senescence, which in turn cause further 
changes in cellular metabolism in OA.

but proteomic studies have revealed that metabolic 
adaptation of chondrocytes to an inflammatory micro-
environment has a direct effect on the composition of 
membrane proteins in these cells (A.M., unpublished 
data). Chondrocytes are also able to sense the concen-
trations of oxygen and glucose in the ECM and respond 
appropriately by adjusting their cellular metabolism, 
thus becoming glycolytic during periods of acute 
 
nutrient and oxygen stress41.
Glycolytic pathways. The metabolic switch in activated 
chondrocytes means that these cells derive ATP from 
glycolysis, diverting pyruvate away from oxidative 
phosphorylation and thereby enabling ATP genera-
tion during periods of low oxygen availability (FIG. 4). 
Chondrocytes express the glucose transporter GLUT1 
(REF. 54), which is upregulated in response to hypoxia55, 
thus increasing their ability to take up glucose in low 
oxygen conditions. Levels of glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase are also increased in cartilage explants 
exposed to oxidative damage56, indicating increased 
glycolytic activity. Anaerobic glycolysis occurs at an 
increased rate in chondrocytes in OA57; lactate dehydro-
genase converts two pyruvate molecules into lactate in 
the cytosol, generating two molecules of ATP (instead 
of the 36 molecules generated by oxidative phospho-
rylation) and leading to an accumulation of lactate, 
further reducing the pH of an already acidic micro-
environment58. Profound ATP depletion in chondro-
cytes is associated with increased production of nitric 
oxide (NO) in the osteoarthritic joint49. Consequently, 
activity of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodi-
esterase family member 1 (an ATP scavenger) increases, 
causing a subsequent increase in extracellular levels of 
inorganic pyrophosphate. This increase in inorganic 
pyrophosphate might in turn stimulate chondrocalcinosis, 
eventually leading to matrix calcification (an important 
contributor to OA progression59). It should be noted, 
however, that the ubiquitous presence of calcification 
in patients with OA identified in a CT imaging study60 
has raised questions over the appropriateness of the term 
‘chondrocalcinosis’
.
Mitochondria and oxidative stress. Mitochondria are 
the powerhouses of the cell, providing energy in the 
form of ATP for a range of activities including move-
ment, cellular differentiation, cell death, regulation of 
signalling and control of the cell cycle61. Furthermore, 
mitochondria serve as molecular platforms integrating 
multiple innate immune signalling pathways62. However, 
in degenerative conditions (such as OA), alterations 
occur in mitochondrial structure, dynamics and genome 
stability, resulting in reduced mitochondrial respiration 
and excessive production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) leading to oxidative damage. Mitochondrial dys-
function and oxidative stress are hallmarks of OA63, with 
increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage being 
seen in chondrocytes from patients with OA compared 
with chondrocytes from healthy individuals64. This dam-
age in chondrocytes from patients with OA is accom-
panied by a reduced capacity for mtDNA repair and an 
increased rate of apoptosis64.
Alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential 
are observed in chondrocytes from patients with OA65. 
Analysis of mitochondrial electron transport chain 
activity in chondrocytes from patients with OA has 
shown a decrease in complexes II and III compared 
with chondrocytes from healthy individuals, along with 
a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential57 
(maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential 
is essential to driving ATP synthesis by oxidative phos-
phorylation). Although most ATP in chondrocytes in 
OA comes from glycolysis rather than oxidative phos-
phorylation66, mitochondrial ROS help to maintain 
the cellular redox balance in favour of glycolysis67. 
Treatment of chondrocytes from patients with OA 
with 4- 
hydroxynonenal (4HNE) (an end-product of 
lipid peroxidation and a second messenger in oxidative 
stress) results in the depletion of ATP, NADPH and glu-
tathione and the inhibition of glucose uptake and TCA 
cycle activity68. Additionally, inhibition of complexes 
III and V of the electron transport chain modulates 
the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 
in chondrocytes and proteoglycan levels in cartilage69. 
Therefore, the loss of energy reserves within chon-
drocytes coupled with a shift in metabolic pathways 
towards glycolysis contributes to the impaired ECM 
synthetic function, anabolism and reduced viability 
seen in chondrocytes in OA69,70. Furthermore, NADPH 
oxidase 4 is increased in chondrocytes from patients 
with OA and can modulate matrix degrading enzymes 
Figure 2 | Phenotypes of osteoarthritis. Evidence suggests that patients with 
osteoarthritis (OA) fall into multiple phenotypic subgroups defined on the basis of the 
main driver of disease, one of which is a distinct metabolic phenotype, although all OA 
phenotypes probably involve metabolic alterations. Cartilage, bone and synovium are all 
affected by external and internal drivers of disease such as inflammation, injury or 
biomechanical alterations, metabolic reprogramming and immunomodulation, but 
different synovial joint tissues dominate the disease in different patients with OA.

such as MMPs and the a disintegrin and metalloprotein-
ase with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS) family of 
proteins by inducing ROS production71.
Oxidative stress mediated by ROS and NO also has 
an important role in metabolic dysregulation within the 
osteoarthritic joint72–74. NO production is elevated in 
human OA, animal models of spontaneous OA, animal 
models of experimentally-induced OA and in cytokine-
treated or activated chondrocytes75–77. Furthermore, 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is present in both 
the synovium and cartilage, and its expression has been 
observed in degenerating regions of OA cartilage76,77. 
NO and other ROS are involved in the accumulation 
of mtDNA damage following exposure to cytokines; 
 
the mitochondria-targeted DNA repair enzyme hOGG1 
was able to rescue mtDNA integrity, preserve ATP levels, 
re-establish mitochondrial transcription and diminish 
apoptosis in chondrocytes following exposure to IL-1β 
and TNF78. Studies in Kashin–Beck disease (KBD), 
 
a chronic and endemic osteochondropathy prevalent 
mainly in Tibet and China, have also increased our 
understanding of the role of metabolism in osteo-
articular disease. In KBD, chondrocytes exhibit increased 
numbers of de-energized mitochondria, a reduction in 
cellular ATP levels and an increase in mitochondrial 
mass, release of cytochrome c (a key component of the 
electron transport chain in mitochondria) and activa-
tion of caspase 9 and caspase 3, leading ultimately to cell 
apoptosis79. Markers of oxidative stress are also higher in 
cartilage from patients with KBD than in cartilage from 
healthy individuals80.
Increased levels of lipid peroxidation, as found in the 
osteoarthritic joint, also lead to an increase in breaks in 
mtDNA in chondrocytes from patients with OA, which 
in turn affects the telomeric DNA and replicative lifespan 
of chondrocytes, as well as the subsequent integrity of 
proteoglycans in osteoarthritic cartilage45,81. The adverse 
microenvironment of the osteoarthritic joint leads to the 
Figure 3 | Metabolism in homeostatic chondrocytes. In healthy joints, chondrocytes utilize glucose as well as other 
metabolic fuels and sources of energy. Glucose utilization via glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation helps to maintain 
an optimal level of mitochondrial function and biogenesis. The metabolism of healthy chondrocytes is therefore optimized

increased generation of ROS and NO by chondrocytes82 
(and synoviocytes83), inducing more mtDNA damage 
and suppressing mitochondrial oxidative phosphoryla-
tion69,84,85, acting as a feed-forward loop. These changes 
increase the production of MMPs85–87 and can enhance 
the responsiveness of chondrocytes to cytokine-induced 
inflammation through nuclear factor-κB activation87. 
ROS scavengers slow down cartilage loss in animal mod-
els of joint inflammation88 and decrease levels of MMPs 
in chondrocytes85,89.
Key regulators of metabolism. A key molecule associated 
with metabolism in chondrocytes is AMP-activated pro-
tein kinase (AMPK), which regulates energy metabolism 
through the downstream mediators, NAD-dependent 
protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and mechanis-
tic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Depletion of AMPK 
in chondrocytes increases their catabolic response to 
proinflammatory cytokines90. A decreased capacity for 
mitochondrial biogenesis in chondrocytes is linked to 
reduced AMPK activity and decreased expression of 
SIRT1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ 
co-activator 1α (PGC1α; the so-called master regula-
tor of mitochondrial biogenesis), TFAM (transcription 
factor A, mitochondrial), nuclear respiratory factor 1 
(NRF1) and NRF2 (REF. 91). TFAM-mediated activation 
of the AMPK–SIRT1–PGC1α pathway increases mito-
chondrial biogenesis in chondrocytes, limiting OA pro-
gression91. Furthermore, deficiency in AMPK and SIRT1 
modulates PGC1α activity, leading to reduced oxidative

 stress and procatabolic responses in chondrocytes from 
patients with OA91, and so potentially represents a mech-
anism to inhibit the progression of cartilage damage in 
OA92. Inhibition of SIRT1 results in increased procata-
bolic responses to IL-1β and TNF in chondrocytes from 
patients with OA93,94. Additionally, autophagy, which is 
known to have chrondroprotective effects but is defec-
tive in chondrocytes from patients with OA, is promoted 
by AMPK and SIRT1, resulting in the subsequent repair 
of damaged mitochondria95.
In the destabilisation of medial meniscus (DMM) 
mouse model of OA, cartilage-specific deletion of 
mTOR upregulated autophagy and protected mice from 
disease96, whereas aberrant mTOR signalling associated 
with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ defi-
ciency resulted in severe and accelerated OA97. Cell sur-
vival and matrix synthesis is suppressed in chondrocytes 
from patients with OA via microRNA 634 targeting of 
PIK3R1, thus modulating the PI3K–AKT–ribosomal 
protein S6 kinase (S6) and PI3K–AKT–mTOR–S6 sig-
nalling pathways98. Many other regulatory molecules 
are also implicated in chondrocyte physiology and 
pathophysiology and have links to metabolism5,99–101, 
but the overt effects of activation and inhibition of these 
 
pathways on cellular metabolism are not yet understood.
Chondrosenescence. Once activated by stressors such as 
proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins and ROS, 
normally quiescent articular chondrocytes become 
activated and undergo a phenotypic shift through a 
phenomenon recently described as ‘chondrosenes-
cence’
, leading to further disruption of homeostasis and 
metabolism in cartilage6. The chondrosenescent pheno-
type is highly procatabolic and is intimately linked with 
a disturbed interplay between autophagy and inflam-
masomes102, and with the development of a senescent 
secretory and inflammatory state6. The production and 
secretion of soluble and insoluble factors by senescent 
chondrocytes further contributes to the inflammatory 
microenvironment that is believed to drive the catabolic 
degradation of ECM macromolecules in articular carti-
lage. Furthermore, the secreted molecules, in particular 
NO, act as potent inducers of gene expression, further 
supporting the aberrant expression of proinflammatory 
and catabolic genes. These secreted molecules also sup-
press mitochondrial dysfunction and impair oxidative 
phosphorylation103 which in turn can promote calci-
fication of the ECM and formation of inflammatory 
hydroxyapatite crystals69,84.
Synovium
In addition to cartilage, other joint tissues such as the 
synovial membrane104,105, subchondral bone106 and peri-
articular soft tissues107 contribute to the disease process 
in OA. Inflammation of the synovium occurs in early 
and late phases of OA and is associated with degener-
ative alterations in cartilage108. This synovitis is qualita-
tively and histologically similar, but not identical, to that 
seen in patients with RA. Despite some similarities, there 
are important differences too; notably, the polymorpho-
nuclear leukocytes that are prominent in synovitis in RA 
are absent in synovitis in OA109. Synovitis linked to the 
innate immune system59 has a key role in OA patho-
genesis and influences metabolism in joint tissues108. 
Catabolic and proinflammatory mediators produced 
by the inflamed synovium such as cytokines, ROS, NO, 
prostaglandin E2 and neuropeptides alter cellular metab-
olism and the balance of cartilage matrix degradation 
and repair110. Synovitis seems to be a common feature of 
later stages of OA, which are characterized by infiltrat-
ing macrophages, T cells and mast cells and high levels 
of proinflammatory cytokines111. Inflammation of the 
synovium leads to increased production of the proteo-
lytic enzymes responsible for cartilage breakdown112. 
Increased catabolism in cartilage releases molecules that 
induce further synovial inflammation, creating a feed-
forward loop that exacerbates clinical symptoms and 
joint degradation in patients with OA31. Inflammatory 
mediators released by chondrocytes and synoviocytes 
also drive oxidative stress, causing damage to joint 
 
tissues via ROS113.
Immune cells. Evidence for metabolic changes in immune 
cells in the inflamed osteoarthritic joint is scarce and 
indirect. There is evidence from metabolomics studies 
for metabolic changes in immune cells in OA. Metabolic 
profiling has identified changes in metabolites specific to 
collagen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid metab-
olism, energy metabolism and tryptophan metabolism 
in OA, suggesting that the metabolic state alters as the 
disease progresses114. Metabolomics is particularly well 
suited for OA research because of the tremendous hetero-
geneity in the disease process and recognition that no 
single biomarker can reflect the breadth of temporal and 
pathological processes involved.
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes. In contrast to the metabolic 
profile of chondrocytes in OA, which has been exten-
sively studied, little is known about the metabolic profile 
of FLSs and immune cells that infiltrate the synovium in 
patients with OA. To date, the majority of studies have 
focused on FLSs in RA, in which a hypoxia-induced shift 
towards glycolysis is associated with increased migra-
tion and invasiveness95,115. Chronic hypoxia alters cellu-
lar bioenergetics by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction 
and glycolytic pathways, thereby supporting abnormal 
angiogenesis, cellular invasion and pannus formation in 
the joints of patients with RA115. Glucose metabolism 
therefore has a critical role in the activity and behav-
iour of FLSs in RA116. The glycolytic enzyme glucose-6- 
phosphate isomerase (GPI) also promotes the prolifera-
tion of and inhibits the apoptosis of FLSs from patients 
with RA117. Interestingly, GPI is a multifunctional pro-
tein that also acts as an angiogenic factor to stimulate 
endothelial cell motility118. Upregulation of glucose 
transport and a switch to glycolysis have been implicated 
in the regulation of angiogenesis in RA and OA119.
In a 2016 study, an increase in the ratio of glycoly-
sis to oxidative phosphorylation was observed in FLSs, 
although this increase was lower in FLSs from patients 
with OA than in those from patients with RA115. Similar 
levels of the glucose metabolism-related genes LDHA and

 PDHK1 were seen in FLS from patients with OA and RA; 
however, expression of GLUT1 and HK2 were increased 
only in FLSs from patients with RA115. Following stimu-
lation with lipopolysaccharide, GLUT1 expression and 
lactate levels were increased in FLSs from patients with 
OA, and blockade of glycolysis inhibited the migratory 
capacity of these cells115. In another study, administration 
of high concentrations of glucose to FLSs from patients 
with OA induced the expression of vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) and the production of ROS via 
the PIK3–ATK signalling pathway120. Blockade of the 
universal oxygen sensor prolyl hydroxylase domain- 
containing protein 2 (PHD2; also known as Egl nine 
homologue 1) in FLSs from patients with OA increased 
the expression of angiogenic factors, which were subse-
quently able to induced tube formation by endothelial 
cells121. Connective tissue growth factor-induced IL-1β 
expression in FLSs from patients with OA is mediated 
by αvβ3/αvβ5 integrin-dependent generation of ROS, 
the blocking of which with berberine prevented cartilage 
damage in a rat model of OA122. Furthermore, oxidative 
stress induces prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (also known 
as COX2) expression in FLSs from patients with OA, an 
outcome that can be reversed by the antioxidant N-acetyl 
cysteine123. Collectively, these studies highlight a critical 
role for glucose transport and metabolism in FLSs in 
 
the synovium of patients with OA, as well as in patients 
with RA116.
Metabolic targets in OA therapy?
Several studies have reported the consequences of block-
ing metabolic regulators such as AMPK and mTOR in 
in vitro and in vivo models of OA. Intra-articular injec-
tion of rapamycin (which targets mTOR) into mice with 
experimental OA substantially reduced the severity of 
damage to articular cartilage, an effect mediated by an 
increase in autophagy and by inhibiting the produc-
tion of VEGF, collagen type X α1 chain and MMP13 
(REF. 124). In another study using a mouse model of OA, 
treatment of mice with rapamycin reduced the sever-
ity of cartilage degradation and synovitis, an effect that 
was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of 
ADAMTS5 and IL-1β in articular cartilage125. Taken 
together, these studies suggest that pharmacological 
activation of autophagy via mTOR signalling pathways 
might be an effective therapeutic approach for treating 
OA. Decreased AMPK activity is also associated with 
cartilage damage; chondrocytes from patients with OA 
that have been depleted of AMPK exhibit increased 
catabolic responses to proinflammatory cytokines and 
biochemical injury, effects that are attenuated by mol-
ecules thought to activate AMPK126,127. Thus AMPK-
activating drugs such as methotrexate, metformin 
 
and sodium salicylate could have therapeutic effects in 
this disease127.
The glycolytic switch also represents a potential ther-
apeutic target in arthritis. Inhibition of glycolysis might 
seem counterintuitive, but modulation of glycolytic 
pathways could directly modulate the responses of FLSs 
and chondrocytes to inflammatory mediators, thereby 
making inhibition of glycolysis a potentially effective 
treatment strategy for OA and RA. Specifically, over-
expression of the key glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo 
2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) (the 
activity of which is impaired in cartilage in OA) reduces 
the activity of caspase 3 and promotes the production of 
aggrecan and type II collagen in explants of cartilage and 
chondrocytes from patients with OA128. These results 
indicate that PFKFB3 might also provide a therapeutic 
target for the treatment of OA. A more detailed under-
standing of the molecules that regulate these metabolic 
switches could enhance the efficacy of biological thera-
pies for patients with RA so that treatments can be more 
rationally applied and personalized for patients. There 
are currently no such treatments for OA129, but increas-
ing our knowledge of metabolism within the joint could 
reveal mechanistic insights necessary for the develop-
ment of new therapies for OA. Therapeutically targeting 
metabolic pathways to treat rheumatic diseases is covered 
 
in depth in a Perspectives article130 in this journal.
Conclusions
The pathogenesis of OA involves metabolic alterations 
in articular cartilage, subchondral bone and synovium. 
These changes influence metabolic pathways in chon-
drocytes, synoviocytes and bone cells and their inter-
actions with the immune system via inflammatory 
mediators. Accumulating evidence suggests that a meta-
bolic switch towards glycolysis is important for immune 
responses and the activation of inflammatory pathways 
in chronic diseases, including OA and RA. This change in 
 
metabolism enables immune and inflammatory cells 
to gain energy to meet the increased demands for the 
biosynthesis of proinflammatory and degradative pro-
teins during periods of acute cellular stress or nutrient 
deprivation. Similar mechanisms seem to operate in 
cells of the synovial joint in OA. A deeper mechanis-
tic understanding of these complex metabolic path-
ways is therefore likely to provide insight into potential 
novel therapeutic strategies for treating OA and other 
inflammatory diseases of joints. At this point, research 
into immunometabolism in OA is still in its infancy; 
however, if the availability of glucose and oxygen are 
impaired in immune cells in OA, then regulators such 
as mTOR, AMPK and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α 
represent potential starting points for the discovery 
of therapeutic targets. An improved understanding of 
physiologic and pathophysiologic regulators of carti-
lage and synovial metabolism is also likely to provide 
new insights into the aetiology and pathophysiology of 
OA. Omics techniques such as metabolomics are likely 
to identify some of the underlying metabolic changes 
in OA131 and help to define the metabolic phenotype 
of OA132,133, especially in the early stages of disease134. 
When combined with proteomics, lipidomics and bio-
informatics, metabolomics will help to reveal the path-
ways, proteins and metabolites that drive inflammatory 
processes in synovial joints, hopefully also revealing 
new therapeutic targets. Future research should also 
focus on delineating the role of metabolism in macro-
phages that infiltrate the synovium in OA and in FLS 
in OA.
