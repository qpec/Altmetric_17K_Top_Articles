The black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) is one of the most feared snake species of the
African savanna. It has a potent, fast-acting neurotoxic venom comprised of dendrotoxins and
α-neurotoxins associated with high fatality in untreated victims. Current antivenoms are both
scarce on the African continent and present a number of drawbacks as they are derived from
the plasma of hyper-immunized large mammals. Here, we describe the development of an
experimental recombinant antivenom by a combined toxicovenomics and phage display
approach. The recombinant antivenom is based on a cocktail of fully human immunoglobulin
G (IgG) monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing dendrotoxin-mediated neurotoxicity of
black mamba whole venom in a rodent model. Our results show the potential use of fully
human monoclonal IgGs against animal toxins and the first use of oligoclonal human IgG
mixtures against experimental snakebite envenoming.

nakebite envenoming exacts a death toll of 80–150,000
victims each year, leaves approximately four times as many
maimed for life1, and has recently been recognized as a
Neglected Tropical Disease by the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO)2. Antivenoms derived from the plasma of hyper-
immunized animals remain the mainstay of snakebite enve-
noming therapy3. However, these present a range of drawbacks
due to their relatively high cost and their heterologous nature that
causes, in some patients, a number of side effects, such as serum
sickness and early adverse reactions, which may include severe
anaphylaxis4–6. Furthermore, it is estimated that only a fraction
of the antibodies in most current antivenoms have a therapeutic
value, as the majority of antibodies isolated from animal plasma
are directed against antigens that are either unrelated to snake
venom or related to venom components with negligible con-
tribution to venom toxicity5. The implication follows that
high amounts of antivenom protein may be needed to treat a
snakebite, with heterologous protein loads reaching as much as
15 g/treatment for some antivenoms in severe envenoming cases7.
Particularly, elapid antivenoms often have an unbalanced anti-
body content with relatively low amounts of antibodies against
small neurotoxic venom components that have low immuno-
genicity, which often leads to low immune responses in pro-
duction animals8–10. Despite the maturity of immunotherapy,
there remains a need for cost-effective antivenoms with improved
safety and efficacy5.
The notorious black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) from
sub-Saharan Africa is a particularly dangerous species due to its
size, defensive nature, and fast-acting neurotoxic venom. Life
threatening clinical manifestations of D. polylepis envenoming
include flaccid paralysis due to blockade of neuromuscular
transmission resulting from inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors in the peripheral nervous system caused by α-
neurotoxins (both short-chain and long-chain types) of the
three-finger toxin superfamily11. In terms of abundance, however,
the venom of D. polylepis is dominated by dendrotoxins, which
are a unique type of neurotoxins that inhibit voltage-dependent
potassium channels causing excitatory effects that result in
involuntary muscle contractions12. In the venom, short neuro-
toxins, long neurotoxins, and dendrotoxins combine synergisti-
cally to provide D. polylepis with a potent neurotoxic bite11.
Recently, recombinant antivenoms based on oligoclonal mix-
tures of human antibodies have been proposed as a cost-
competitive alternative to current antivenoms13. Additionally,
such recombinant antivenoms may provide safer and more
efficacious snakebite therapies due to their compatibility with
the human immune system and the possibility of only including
antibodies of therapeutic value, targeting medically relevant snake
venom toxins, in the antivenom mixture. To discover such anti-
bodies, phage display has been identified as a promising tech-
nology14 and has already yielded a number of neutralizing
antibody
fragments
targeting
venom
toxins
from
snakes
(reviewed in Laustsen et al. 2016)5. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no fully human IgG antibody has been reported
against any venom toxin from any multicellular organism, let
alone a snake. Human IgGs have the benefits over antibody
fragments of a prolonged half-life and different effector functions
that depend on the Fc fragment. This may be of great therapeutic
value for neutralization of systemically-acting toxins that leak
from the bite site in victims over the course of days15,16. Here, we
report the discovery of a suite of human IgGs that provide pro-
tection in vivo against dendrotoxins from the black mamba when
administered by intracereberoventricular injection. This discovery
approach combined toxicovenomics17, antibody phage display
technology18, antibody engineering, mammalian cell expression,
and whole venom in vivo neutralization studies in rodents. These
results, thus, provide a proof of concept that oligoclonal mixtures
of recombinant human IgG antibodies can be exploited to treat
envenoming by the black mamba.
Results
Description and preparation of venom antigens (toxins).
D. polylepis venom was fractionated using RP-HPLC11, resolving
the key dendrotoxins in four venom fractions (Dp5, Dp6, Dp7,
and Dp8) that cannot be further resolved in quantitative
yields with standardized techniques. While Dp8 contains almost
pure dendrotoxin-1 (P00979 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/
P00979)), the venom fractions Dp5, Dp6, and Dp7 are ‘mixed
fractions’ that contain similar amounts of at least one den-
drotoxin and at least one type II α-neurotoxins. Previous pro-
teomic studies have identified the toxin components of Dp5, Dp6,
and Dp7 to contain the same dendrotoxin (a homolog of den-
drotoxin-δ, P00982 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00982),
from the Eastern green mamba, D. angusticeps) and a type II α-
neurotoxin (α-elapitoxin Dpp2c, P01397 (https://www.uniprot.
org/uniprot/P01397))11.
Phage display selection and screening of scFv binders. Fol-
lowing three rounds of panning against selected venom fractions
containing dendrotoxins, polyclonal ELISAs revealed that anti-
body binders had been enriched (Fig. 1). Antibody genes (in scFv
format) were isolated from both the second and third panning
rounds, sub-cloned into an scFv bacterial expression vector19, and
188 clones were picked and their antibody expressed20. Recom-
binant monoclonal antibodies were tested for binding to respec-
tive target antigens (see example with Dp8 as antigen Fig. 2).
Using a cut-off score of 5000 fluorescence units (25 times above
the background binding signal), the top binders (up to 94) were
picked for each antigen for further characterization (DNA
sequencing and affinity ranking). An Expression-Normalized
Capture (ENC) assay was used to rank the antibody clones by
affinity. In this assay, limiting amounts of anti-FLAG antibody
were used to capture FLAG-tagged scFvs in the expression culture
supernatant. Since the scFv expression level for each clone in
culture supernatant is well above the capture capacity of the anti-
FLAG antibody coated in each well, differences in antibody
expression are normalized so that the binding signal better
reflects differences in affinity between scFv and antigen.
Conversion of scFvs to IgG format and characterization. A
panel of unique scFv-formatted antibodies that yielded the
highest binding signals in the ENC assay were selected for con-
version to IgG format. Following expression by transient trans-
fection in Expi293TM cells, ELISA was used to confirm retention
of target binding.
Twenty-five IgG-formatted antibodies were produced and
purified by protein A chromatography. Using a fluid-phase
technique based on protein G-beads pull-down of antigen-
antibody complexes, followed by acid dissociation and MALDI-
TOF MS analysis (see example in Fig. 3), binding to a
dendrotoxin homologous to dendrotoxin-δ11 in the venom
fractions was confirmed for 4/4 IgGs against Dp5, 3/4 IgGs
against Dp6, and 1/8 IgGs against Dp7 (Table 1). The Dp8
fraction was known to consist predominantly of dendrotoxin-1,
with only minor traces of other toxins11. A pull-down experiment
was performed for clone 367_01_H01, which confirmed that
dendrotoxin-1 was indeed the target for this clone (Table 1).
In vivo neutralization of dendrotoxins. In total, 24 out of 25
recombinant human IgGs targeting black mamba neurotoxins
were tested in vivo. All IgGs were evaluated for neutralization of

 lethality by the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) route, where nine
showed full (100%) protection against the venom fraction they
were raised against (Tables 2 and 3). Even at the highest dose
tested, seven IgGs failed to provide survival in the 24 h assay,
although most of these IgGs showed prolonged survival time, as
compared to controls, during the assay. Eight IgGs provided
partial survival in the 24 h assay at one or more dose regimes
(Tables 2 and 3).

 The i.c.v. assay is particularly useful for assaying toxicity of
dendrotoxins, as these neurotoxins are highly potent when
administered i.c.v., but display lower toxicity by intravenous (i.v.)
administration, requiring relatively high doses to induce leth-
ality11. In contrast, α-neurotoxins are less potent when adminis-
tered i.c.v. and are better assayed using the i.v. route of
administration. Three of the four investigated venom fractions
contain a mixture of dendrotoxins and type II α-neurotoxins11,
and it was observed that only dendrotoxin-targeting IgGs were
able to provide full survival in the i.c.v. assay (compare
Table 1 with Tables 2 and 3). Clones 364_01_A01, 364_01_B01,
364_01_D03, and 364_01_D04 target the type II α-neurotoxin
present in Dp7 and were therefore also assayed using the i.v.
route. Unfortunately, these IgGs failed in providing full protec-
tion, although clone 364_01_B01 provided a low survival rate (1/
4) when mice were challenged with 10.6 µg toxin pre-incubated
with the IgG at a molar ratio of 3:1 (IgG:toxin). Similarly, clone
364_01_A01 provided significantly prolonged survival, although
all challenged mice died between 12–18 h. The present findings
thus demonstrate that effective dendrotoxin-targeting human
IgGs were discovered, but more work (such as affinity matura-
tion) may be needed to improve the discovered IgGs that target
type II α-neurotoxins. Moreover, this work also demonstrates that
the discovered human IgGs could neutralize the lethal effect of
the target dendrotoxins present in more than one venom fraction
(e.g., 363_01_F07 which completely neutralizes the dendrotoxins
in Dp5 and Dp6 and provides some protection against Dp7)
(Table 2). The mass spectrometry data (Table 1) suggests that, in
this case, the observed neutralization ability is due to the presence
of a key dendrotoxin (or very similar dendrotoxins) in more than
one venom fraction.
To explore whether the dendrotoxin-mediated neurotoxicity of
the whole venom could be completely abrogated using the
discovered human IgGs, antibody cocktails were designed
(Table 4) and evaluated against whole venom by the i.c.v. route.
In all cases, the combination of antibodies to dendrotoxin-1 and

 the dendrotoxin-δ homolog was superior to anti-dendrotoxin-1
(367_01_H01) alone. Anti-dendrotoxin-1 (367_01_H01) was
used
along
with
different
combinations
of
antibodies
to
dendrotoxin-δ. For example, Cocktail 2 included 363_01_F07
and 365_01-G06 whereas Cocktail 1 included these, as well as
an additional antibody (361_01_F07) (Tables 3 and 4). Both
cocktails successfully provided full protection against whole
venom when injected via the i.c.v. route at a challenge dose of
1.5 µg of whole venom pre-incubated with the IgG cocktails at
IgG:toxin molar ratios of 4:1 and 3:1 (Fig. 4). Omission of one
or other of the anti-dendrotoxin-δ-homolog antibodies from
Cocktail 2 yielded reduced protection. For example, neutraliza-
tion tests against whole venom were performed i.c.v. using
Cocktail 3 (where 365_01_G06 had been substituted with
additional 363_01_F07), Cocktail 4 (where 363_01_F07 had
been substituted with additional 365_01_G06) (Table 4), and
367_01_H01 alone. As seen in Fig. 5, none of these cocktails
were able to provide equivalent protection at equimolar doses
compared to Cocktail 2. Thus, Cocktail 2 represented the
minimum cocktail providing full protection in this experiment.
Finally, Cocktail 1 and 2 were tested against whole venom by
the i.v. route to demonstrate that these cocktails were truly
dendrotoxin-specific and that whole venom cannot be neutralized,
when using the i.v. route, unless both dendrotoxins and α-
neurotoxins
in
the
venom
are
neutralized21.
As
expected,
similar survival curves (rapid death upon injection) were observed
for mice challenged with 25.8 µg of whole venom alone and mice
challenged with a similar dose of whole venom pre-incubated
with Cocktail 1 and 2 at molar ratios of 3:1 and 4:1 (IgG:toxin),
respectively.
For comparative purposes, an equine-derived F(ab’)2 poly-
clonal antivenom was tested for its efficacy against the lethal
effect of D. polylepis venom by the i.c.v. route. This antivenom
had been previously shown to be highly effective in the
neutralization of lethality of this venom by the i.v. route, with a
Median Effective Dose of 5.25 mg venom neutralized per mL
antivenom11, an observation that was confirmed in the present
study. In contrast, when lethality was tested by the i.c.v. route,
the antivenom failed to neutralize this venom even at a ratio
of 0.33 mg venom per mL antivenom, as all mice receiving the
mixture of venom and antivenom died, whereas control mice
injected with antivenom alone survived.
Discussion
The results presented here are the first report of the use of human
IgG antibodies capable of neutralizing animal toxins in vivo.
Moreover, with this report, we demonstrate that the dendrotoxin-
mediated neurotoxicity of whole venom of the black mamba can
be neutralized in an i.c.v. rodent model using carefully selected
oligoclonal mixtures of monoclonal human IgGs. Our results
further
indicate
that
individual
monoclonal
dendrotoxin-
targeting IgGs cannot achieve this alone, and it is likely to be
essential to employ antibody mixtures that neutralize several key
toxins of black mamba whole venom to achieve full protection

 against dendrotoxin-mediated neurotoxicity. Finally, through
systematic testing, we determined a minimum IgG cocktail
(Cocktail 2) containing three human IgGs that is capable of
providing full protection against lethality in mice co-injected with
lethal doses of whole venom by the i.c.v. route. The value of these
antibodies is underscored by the fact that a polyvalent antivenom
in clinical use, which is highly effective in the neutralization of D.
polylepis venom when tested by the i.v. route, failed to neutralize
venom toxicity when assays were performed by the i.c.v. route.
Since dendrotoxins are the predominant neurotoxins upon i.c.v.
injection, whereas α-neurotoxins predominantly mediate toxicity
when using the i.v. route, our findings suggest that the equine
polyvalent antivenom has limitations for the neutralization of
dendrotoxins, hence reinforcing the potential of recombinant
antibodies against this type of neurotoxin.
Three limitations exist for this work. (1) When using an i.c.v.
model, dendrotoxins are the predominant toxic components, and
neutralization of whole D. polylepis venom can be achieved by
neutralizing these toxins only. When switching to an i.v. model,
neutralization of α-neurotoxins is likely to be essential, as these
are expected to be the main drivers of toxicity by this route. This
speculation is supported by our finding that both IgG cocktails
tested in this work could not provide survival against whole
venom when i.v. administration was employed. (2) A model
based on i.c.v. does not reflect a typical envenoming, but only
demonstrates the ability of toxin-targeting IgGs to neutralize
some neurotoxins. Thus, despite the usefulness of the i.c.v. route
to assess the neutralization of dendrotoxins, the use of the i.v.
route is recommended to test neutralization of α-neurotoxins and
crude
venoms.
(3)
Finally,
although
incubation
and
co-
administration of venom and IgGs follows the recommended
WHO guidelines22, such experiments fail to account for the
impact of toxicokinetics and pharmacokinetics. It would be
relevant to follow up on these observations with ‘rescue’ experi-
ments, where IgGs are administered i.v. after a period of time
following administration of whole venom i.m. or s.c., as this will
better reflect a real-life envenoming situation.
Taken together, the data provided here constitutes a proof of
concept for the use of oligoclonal mixtures of recombinant
human IgGs against snakebite envenoming. The use of carefully
selected human IgG antibodies holds the promise of delivering
safer and more effective treatments against snakebite envenoming
due to the compatibility with the human immune system and the
possibility of only including antibodies of therapeutic value in a
recombinant antivenom5,6. Moreover, as cost-efficacy remains
one of the main challenges of delivering biotherapeutics to
patients in developing countries1, the use of oligoclonal recom-
binantly expressed human IgGs has been theorized to be cost-
competitive with current plasma-derived antivenoms13. These
results bring hope that recombinant antivenoms based on fully
human IgG antibodies may in the future be available for the
therapy against snakebite envenomings.
Methods
Venom fractionation. Pooled D. polylepis venom from several specimens origi-
nating from Kenya was obtained in lyophilized form from Latoxan SAS, France.
Venom fractions Dp5, Dp6, Dp7, and Dp8 containing dendrotoxins from
D. polylepis were isolated from crude venom by RP-HPLC (Agilent 1200) on a C18
column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle; Teknokroma). Elution was carried out at 1
mL/min using Solution A (water, containing 0.1% TFA) and a gradient towards
solution B (acetonitrile, containing 0.1% TFA): 0% B for 5 min, 0–15% B over 10
min, 15–45% B over 60 min, 45–70% B over 10 min, and 70% B over 9 min.
Fractions were collected manually and dried in a vacuum centrifuge11.
Biotinylation and MS analysis of toxins. Venom fractions were dissolved in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline; Sigma-
Aldrich) to yield concentrations of 0.85–6.39 μg/μL. Biotin linked to N-hydro-
xysuccinimide (NHS) via a PEG4-linker (EZ-Link™ NHS-PEG4-Biotin, No-Weigh™
Format, Thermo Scientific, 21329) was added to the toxin solutions at molar ratios
of 1:1 to 1:2 (toxin: biotinylation reagent) and left at room temperature for 30 min.
Buffer exchange columns (Vivacon 500, Sartorius, 2000 Da Molecular Weight Cut-
Off) were employed for purification of the biotinylated toxins using three washes of
500 μL PBS and an elution volume of 150 μL PBS. Protein concentrations were
determined based on individually calculated extinction coefficients (http://web.
expasy.org/protparam/) and absorbances measured on a BMG labtech PHERAStar
Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. The extent of biotinylation was analyzed by
MALDI-TOF in a Proteomics Analyzer 4800 Plus mass spectrometer (Applied
Biosystems) to ensure that over-biotinylation had not taken place23.
Phage display selection and primary screening. For phage display selection, the
IONTAS phage display library was employed. This library is a human antibody
phage display library of 4 × 1010 clones, with antibodies in the form of single chain
variable fragments (scFvs), which was constructed from B lymphocytes collected
from 43 non-immunized human donors24. Selection of scFv binders from the
IONTAS phage display library and primary TRF assay screening for dendrotoxin
binders were performed as described elsewhere24,25. Briefly, selected antibodies
were sub-cloned from the phage display vector using Nco I and Not I restriction
endonuclease sites into a vector for expression of soluble scFvs19 and transformed
into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (New England Biolabs). Individual scFv clones (up to
188 scFv clones against each target) were picked, expressed in 96-well format, and
scFv-containing supernatants tested for binding to their corresponding venom
fraction targets (1–5 μg/mL) indirectly immobilized on streptavidin (10 μg/mL)
coated MaxiSorp plates using the DELFIA system25. For binding detection, 1 in
1500 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, F1804) conjugated with Europium (custom
labeled by Perkin Elmers) was used. Ninety-four binders against each target were
cherry-picked and sequenced (Eurofin Genomics sequencing service) using S10b
primer (GGCTTTGTTAGCAGCCGGATCTCA). The antibody framework and
CDR regions were annotated and analyzed to identify unique clones.
Expression-normalized capture (ENC) assay. For the ENC assays, black Max-
iSorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma,
2.5 μg/ml in PBS, 50 μL per well). After blocking with 2% M-PBS (skim milk in
PBS), washing with PBS, and addition of 30 μL of 6% M-PBS to each well, 30 μL of
individual auto-induction culture supernatants20 containing expressed scFv was
added for each scFv to the assay plate. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T
(PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) and three times with PBS. Binding of biotinylated antigen
(tested using both 2.5 nM and 25 nM of each antigen in 2% M-PBS, 50 μL per well
for 1 h) was detected using Europium-labeled Streptavidin (Perkin Elmer, 1244-
360, 1 μg/mL in PBS-M, 50 μL per well for 30 min).
IgG expression and purification. VH and VL genes of 30 antibodies that showed
highest binding signal in the ENC assay were sub-cloned into a dual promoter
mammalian expression vector. The pINT3-hg1 vector (Fig. 6) has a dual promoter
expression cassette, in which the heavy chain expression is controlled by the
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, and the light chain expression is driven by
elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1-alpha) promoter. An alternative vector (pINT54-
hg1) with a dual CMV promoter driving both heavy and light chain expression was
also available and used in some cases. VH chains of the selected antibodies were
amplified from the pSANG10 scFv vector using primers pSang10_pelB
(CGCTGCCCAGCCGGCCATGG) and HLINK3_R (CTGAACCGCCTCCACCA
CTCGA), and the VL chains were amplified using primers LLINK2_F
(CTCTGGCGGTGGCGCTAGC) and 2097_R (GATGGTGATGATGATGTGCG
GATGCG). Amplified VH genes were digested with Nco I and Xho I restriction
endonucleases, and the VL genes were digested with Nhe I and Not I restriction
endonucleases. Digested VH and VL gene fragments were ligated into the pINT3-
Hg1 or pINT54 hg1 plasmids (digested with Nhe I and Xho I restriction endo-
nucleases) along with a stuffer fragment (digested with Nco I and Not I restriction
endonucleases) encoding the constant light chain region (CL) and the CMV pro-
moter as a four-part ligation using T4 DNA ligase (Roche, 10481220001).

 In order to express the IgG antibodies in mammalian cells, transfection quality
DNA was prepared using Plasmid Plus Kit (Qiagen, 12945). A total of 180 μg of the
DNA was transfected into 180 mL of Expi293TM cells (Thermo Fisher) using
ExpiFectamineTM 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher, A14525) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested after 6 days of incubation at 37 °
C, 5% CO2, 130 rpm on a 25 mm orbital shaker. Antibodies were purified from the
culture supernatants by protein A chromatography using the Äkta Pure system
(GE Healthcare). The initial purification was performed using HiTrap MabSelect
SuRe 5 mL column (GE Healthcare, 11-0034-94), using 0.1 M Citrate buffer (pH
3.0) for elution. Eluted proteins were neutralized with half the volume of 1 M Tris
(pH 8.0) and dialyzed twice against 4 L of 2× PBS at 4 °C using GeBAflex Maxi
dialysis tubes (Generon, D035). Dialyzed proteins were concentrated using Amicon
ultra centrifugation filters (Merck Millipore, UFC905024) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. The functionality of purified IgGs was confirmed by a
TRF binding assay. In this assay, IgG binding to biotinylated venom fractions
immobilized on streptavidin coated Nunc MaxiSorp plates was detected using an
anti-human antibody conjugated with Europium (Perkin Elmers, 1244-330, 1 in
1000 dilution).
Identification of target toxin for IgGs. Each monoclonal IgG was mixed, at a 4:1
molar ratio (IgG:toxin), with 0.5 µg of the venom fraction which it was
selected against, or with whole venom, and added to a 20 µL slurry of protein G-
agarose beads (Sigma P7700), in 50 µL of 0.05 M Tris, 0.75 M KCl, pH 7.0
buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The mixtures were incubated for
30 min at room temperature in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf) at 700 rpm. After
centrifugation for 15 s at 5000×g, the beads were washed twice with 200 µL of
the same buffer, twice with 200 µL of PBS, and finally twice with 200 µL of
deionized water. After removing the supernatant from the last wash, the beads
were resuspended in 20 µL of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid in 50% acetonitrile and 50% water, containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 1
mg/mL of monobasic ammonium phosphate. The samples were mixed by vor-
texing for a few seconds, centrifuged for 15 s, and 1 µL of the supernatant was
spotted onto an Opti-TOF 384 plate, dried, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF on a
4800-Plus Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). TOF spectra were
acquired in linear positive mode, using 500 shots at a laser intensity of 4200.
Identification of toxin family was achieved by comparing the obtained masses
with previously reported values26.
Animals. In vivo assays were conducted in CD-1 mice (18–20 g) of both sexes,
supplied by Instituto Clodomiro Picado, following protocols approved by the
Institutional Committee for the Use and Care of Animals (CICUA), University of
Costa Rica. Mice were housed in cages of various sizes for groups of 4–12, and were
provided food and water ad libitum.
Neutralization studies by intracerebroventricular injection. The neutralization
activity of individual IgGs and IgG cocktails against both dendrotoxins and whole
venom was tested by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection in groups of three to
four mice (18–20 g body weight, both sexes used) using different doses of each
venom fraction and whole venom (0.5–1.5 µg per mouse) and different toxin:IgG
molar ratios (1:0.5, 1:0.75, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:6). Venom and venom fraction
doses were selected as to ensure 100% mortality. IgGs and venom fractions/whole
venom were mixed, and solutions were incubated (30 min either at room tem-
perature or at 37 °C). After incubation, mice were injected with a volume of 5–33
µL (dependent on IgG stock concentration). Irrelevant-specificity control mice
were injected with venom fractions/whole venom and anti-lysozyme IgG dissolved
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.12 M NaCl, 0.04 M sodium phosphate buffer,
pH 7.2), while vehicle-control mice were injected with venom fractions/whole
venom in PBS. Time of death was recorded, and Kaplan–Meier curves were used to
represent mouse survival. For comparative purposes, the SAIMR polyvalent anti-
venom (South African Vaccine Producers, batch BC02645) was tested in a similar
fashion. This antivenom is an F(ab’)2 preparation obtained from the plasma of
horses immunized with a mixture of the venoms of ten snake species, including D.
polylepis27. Various dilutions of this antivenom were incubated with a fixed con-
centration of D. polylepis venom. Controls included venom alone and antivenom
alone. After incubation, aliquots of 10 µL, containing 1.5 µg venom, were injected i.
c.v., as described, and deaths were recorded. In addition, antivenom neutralization
of lethality of D. polylepis venom was tested by the i.v. route, as previously
described11.
Neutralization studies by intravenous injection. The neutralization activity of
the IgGs against three-finger toxins and whole venom was tested by intravenous
(i.v.) injection in groups of four mice (18–20 g body weight), using a challenge dose
of 20.1 µg for venom fraction Dp6, 10.6 µg for venom fraction Dp7, and 25.8 µg of
whole venom, and a toxin:IgG molar ratio of 1:3. Venom and venom fraction doses
were selected as to ensure 100% mortality. IgGs and venom fractions/whole venom
were mixed and incubated (30 min at room temperature). Then, aliquots of the
mixtures were injected in the caudal vein, using an injection volume of 100–300 µL.
Irrelevant-specificity control mice were injected with venom fractions/whole
venom and anti-lysozyme IgG dissolved in PBS, while vehicle-control mice were
injected with venom fractions/whole venom in PBS. Time of death was recorded,
and Kaplan–Meier curves were used to represent mouse survival.
