One Sentence Summary  
Modulation of energy metabolism with the small molecule KHS101 promoted tumor-selective 
death of human glioblastoma cells and reduced tumor growth in mice. 
 
Abstract  
Pharmacological inhibition of uncontrolled cell growth with small molecule inhibitors is a 
potential strategy for treating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant primary brain 
cancer. Here, we showed that the synthetic small molecule KHS101 promoted tumor cell death 
in diverse GBM cell models, independent of their tumor subtype, and without affecting the 
viability of non-cancerous brain cell lines. KHS101 exerted cytotoxic effects by disrupting the 
mitochondrial chaperone heat shock protein family D member 1 (HSPD1). In GBM cells, 
KHS101 promoted aggregation of proteins regulating mitochondrial integrity and energy 
metabolism. Mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity and glycolytic activity were selectively 
impaired in KHS101-treated GBM cells. In two intracranial patient-derived xenograft tumor 
 3 
 
models in mice, systemic administration of KHS101 reduced tumor growth and increased 
survival without discernible side effects. These findings suggest that targeting of HSPD1-
dependent metabolic pathways might be an effective strategy for treating GBM. 
 
Introduction 
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and 
among the most devastating cancers (1). Its overall median time to recurrence after surgery and 
standard chemoradiotherapy is ~7 months and the 5-year survival rate remains low (<5%) (2). 
Pre-clinical data have shown that small molecules hold therapeutic promises for treating GBM 
through  perturbation of cell death programs (3), epigenetic and transcriptional pathways (4, 5), 
lethal autophagy (6), and GBM stem cell self-renewal (7). However, GBM biology remains 
poorly understood and there is an unmet need for the identification of new targets and the 
development of alternative therapeutic strategies (2). Although presenting several challenges, 
phenotypic drug discovery and profiling using small molecules have the advantage of addressing 
the complexity of diseases, in particular, when the molecular target(s) and the underlying 
mechanisms of action of a small molecule are identified (8, 9).   
GBM consists of diverse cell populations that can differ in their tumor-promoting 
potential (10). Poorly differentiated (stem cell-like) GBM cells can be isolated from patient 
tumors and expanded for their use in chemical screens and diverse biological investigations 
using serum-free culture conditions as well as orthotopic xenografts in immunodeficient mice 
(10–14). Molecular pathways promoting GBM ‘stemness’ have been implicated in tumor 
development and phenotypic and molecular similarities between neural stem cells and poorly 
differentiated GBM cells have been described  (10, 15, 16). In this context, the question arises as 
to whether chemical compounds that induce neural stem cell differentiation may also have a 
potential for reducing GBM growth.  
KHS101 is one such compound that crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and selectively 
induces neuronal differentiation of hippocampal neural progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo (17). 
Previous studies have revealed transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3) as 
a biologically relevant target of KHS101 (17, 18). TACC3 is a known regulator of cell division 
(19), and an emerging factor in GBM and tumor biology (20–22). The TACC3-targeting and 
 4 
 
neural differentiation-promoting features of KHS101 prompted us to investigate the compound 
in human stem cell-like GBM cell models. 
As inter- and intratumor heterogeneity is a major impediment to broadly efficacious 
GBM therapy, we also sought to address whether KHS101 would affect a spectrum of clinically-
relevant GBM subtypes. To achieve this, we established a panel of different patient-derived 
primary and recurrent GBM cell models that were characterized through cytogenetic and single 
cell gene expression analysis. We observed that KHS101 induces a rapid and selective cytotoxic 
response in this heterogeneous spectrum of patient-derived GBM cell lines. Accordingly, we 
sought to identify the mechanisms of action behind the KHS101 anti-GBM activity utilizing 
gene expression analysis, affinity-based target identification, orthogonal chemical validation, and 
quantitative proteomics. These investigations were complemented by the  analysis of energy 
metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics, which have been  previously implicated in cancer 
biology and the regulation of cancer stem cell phenotypes (23–25). Furthermore, we investigated 
the KHS101 anti-GBM activity in established patient-derived tumor xenografts upon systemic 
administration. 
 
Results  
KHS101 selectively induces cytotoxicity in transcriptionally heterogeneous patient-derived GBM 
cell lines, independent of their molecular subtypes 
GBM is characterized by intra- and intertumor heterogeneity that may hinder therapeutic 
success (26–28). To represent this molecular heterogeneity, we established six patient-derived 
tumor cell models from primary GBM (GBM1, 4, 13), recurrent GBM (GBM20), and rare GBM 
subtypes such as gliosarcoma (GBM11) and recurrent giant cell GBM (GBM14) (table S1). We 
hypothesized that single cell quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-
PCR) analysis using a selection of 85 classifier genes from the published proneural, neural, 
classical, and mesenchymal GBM molecular subtypes (28), and an additional selection of  genes 
playing roles in GBM ‘stemness’ and proliferation, and the cell cycle, could indicate the 
molecular subtype heterogeneity within our GBM cell lines. Transcriptome profiling was carried 
out (after microfluidic chip-based  capture of individual cells) by single cell qRT-PCR of ~45 
randomly selected cells from each tumor model, and from the non-cancerous adult brain 
progenitor cell line NP1 (derivation is described in (14)).  Based on the expression of the 
 5 
 
aforementioned classifier genes, principal component analysis (PCA) indicated transcriptional 
heterogeneity between the different GBM (and NP1) cell lines, and between individual cells 
within each model (Fig. 1A and file S1). Using Computational analysis by cell cycle 
normalization, data discretization, and supervised classification, we stratified our cell lines based 
on their single cell transcriptional phenotypes (file S1). Our analysis showed that the GBM cell 
lines used here possessed either single (mesenchymal or proneural) or double 
(classical/proneural, mesenchymal/proneural) GBM subtype signatures (Fig. 1B and file S1).  
To evaluate the role of KHS101 in tumor cell proliferation, we treated three GBM cell 
lines harboring different molecular signatures with 7.5 µM of KHS101 for 120 hours and 
assessed cell growth by real time imaging. Independent of classical, proneural, and mesenchymal 
molecular subtypes, KHS101 markedly attenuated tumor cell growth as compared to the cells 
treated with the vehicle (Dimethilsulfoxyde, DMSO). KHS101 did not affect cell proliferation in 
the non-cancerous NP1 cell line (Fig. 1C). We then evaluated KHS101in all 6 GBM cell lines 
and showed that KSH101 exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxic properties in all patient-derived 
GBM cell models, and also in the U251 and U87 GBM cell lines (Fig. 1D and fig. S1A). Neither 
bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)-induced differentiation of GBM cells (29) nor reduced 
oxygen tension (5% O2) (30) interfered with KHS101-induced cytotoxicity, and NP cells were 
refractory to KHS101 treatment under both 21% and 5% O2 conditions (fig. S1B). 
KHS101 promotes autophagy and apoptosis in GBM cells 
To examine the distinct cellular phenotypes of KHS101-treated GBM and NP cells, we 
carried out electron microscopy (EM) and immunocytochemistry-based imaging 12 hours after 
KHS101 (7.5 µM) addition to the GBM cell cultures. KHS101-treated GBM1 cells displayed a 
pronounced development of intracellular vacuoles compared to NP1 cells and to GBM cells 
treated with the vehicle (Fig. 2A top). Concomitantly, Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B 
light chain 3B (LC3B)-positive autophagosomal compartments increased in GBM1, and all other 
tested GBM cell models compared to the NP1 line (Fig. 2, A and B). The KHS101-induced 
macro-autophagy phenotype, measured as LC3B-stained cytoplasmic area, was concentration-
dependent in 3 different GBM cell cultures tested (GBM1, GBM11, and GBM20), and was not 
detected in NP1 cells after a 12-hour treatment period (Fig. 2C). The effect of KHS101 on GBM 
autophagic flux was further confirmed by cellular accumulation of the cationic amphiphilic 
tracer dye CYTO-ID in the GBM1 cell line (Fig. 2D). Consistently, EM imaging indicated the 
 6 
 
degradation of electron-dense cytoplasmic cellular content (Fig. S1D). The KHS101-induced 
autophagic phenotype was accompanied by a pro-apoptotic cell fate shown by marked increase 
in caspase 3/7 activation (luminescent assay) in the GBM1, GBM11, and GBM20 cell lines after 
a 48-hour treatment period (compared with the NP1 model; Fig. 2, E and F). A significant 
accumulation of Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells was also observed in GBM1 cells 48 hours 
after KHS101 treatment (fig. S1E). However, chemical inhibition of late-stage autophagy using 
bafilomycin A1 did not prevent this KHS101-induced apoptotic cell death (fig. S1E), suggesting 
that the latter is not autophagy-dependent.   
KHS101 selectively disrupts metabolic pathways in GBM cells   
TACC3 is a known target of KHS101 in rodent neural progenitor cells (17). KHS101 has 
been shown to cause cellular destabilization of TACC3, hence reducing endogenous TACC3 
protein levels over time (18). Western blot analysis showed that KHS101 did not reduce TACC3 
expression by >20% after a 12-hour treatment period in GBM1 cells; however, TACC3 appeared 
reduced by >40% from 18 hours onwards (fig S2A). Accordingly, KHS101-mediated TACC3 
reduction was not linked to the rapid increase in autophagy marker positivity (from <10 to >80% 
CYTO-ID positive cells) measured over a treatment period of 12 hours in GBM1 cells treated 
with 7.5 µM of KHS101 (Fig. 3A). Consistently, the appearance of GBM cell vacuoles was 
observed ~4 hours after KHS101 addition by time lapse microscopy (movie S1). The KHS101-
induced increased autophagy was not seen in TACC3 knockdown cells (fig. S2, B and C), hence 
excluding TACC3 downregulation as a critical player in mediating KHS101 cytotoxicity in the 
GBM context. Microarray transcriptome profiling (ArrayExpress, accession E-MTAB-5713) and 
gene enrichment analysis of KHS101-treated GBM1 cells (using the hypergeometric 
distribution) indicated that, in addition to differentially-regulated cell cycle pathways (Fig. 3B, 
left), genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle were significantly modulated by KHS101 treatment (P<4 x 10-8; Fig. 3B and fig. 
S3A). The KHS101 effect on metabolism-related gene expression was observed using a selection 
of 25 differentially-expressed (>2-fold) marker mRNAs indicating alterations in glycolytic 
(Hexokinase 2, HK2 (31, 32)), oxidative (Heme Oxygenase 1, HMOX1 (33), and pro-apoptotic 
(Harakiri, BCL2 Interacting Protein, HRK (34)) pathways as well as downregulation of known 
GBM ‘stemness’ markers ( Nitric Oxide Synthase 2, NOS2 (15), Inhibitor Of DNA Binding 1, 
HLH Protein, ID1 (35), and Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2, OLIG2 (36) (Fig. 3B, 
 7 
 
right). This KHS101-induced gene signature was confirmed by qRT-PCR in both primary 
(GBM1) and recurrent (GBM20) tumor models but was neither observed in KHS101-treated 
NP1 cells nor untreated TACC3-knockdown GBM1 cells (Fig. 3C).  
To investigate whether the observed changes in metabolic gene expression were linked to 
a direct effect of KHS101 on GBM cell metabolism and mitochondrial function, metabolic 
phenotyping was carried out using five different GBM cell models, the NP1 and NP2 lines, and  
Normal (non-transformed) Human Astrocytes (NHA) using protocols described in (37). 
Extracellular flux analysis was carried out upon addition of vehicle or KHS101 and a metabolic 
phenogram was  obtained by plotting the basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR; indicative of 
OXPHOS/mitochondrial respiration) of the different cell models  as a function of their basal 
extracellular acidification rates (ECAR; an approximation of glycolytic activity). In contrast to 
the NP1, NP2, and NHA cell lines, the GBM cell lines exhibited elevated OCR and/or ECAR 
corresponding to ‘aerobic’ (GBM20), ‘aerobic/energetic’ (GBM1, GBM13), and ‘energetic’ 
(GBM11, GBM14) baseline phenotypes (Fig. 3D). Upon acute KHS101 treatment, the non-
cancerous control cells remained within a ‘modest’ energetic phenotype window and exhibited a 
moderate increase in glycolytic activity (≤ 2-fold; P=0.05). In contrast, KHS101 induced a 
significant hypoxic shift (P<0.0001; student’s t-test, two tailed) and switch in metabolic baseline 
phenotype across all tested GBM cell models, independent of their molecular subtypes (Fig. 3D).  
 
KHS101 affects glycolysis and the TCA cycle in GBM cells  
Next, we examined intracellular fractional enrichment of glucose-derived carbon through 
glycolysis and the TCA cycle in the GBM1 and NP1 cell models using stable isotope substrate 
labeling with U-13C glucose (38) (fig. S4).  Four hours after addition of KHS101 (7.5 µM), 13C 
label enrichment was not significantly different for glucose (Fig. 4A) or fructose 6 phosphate 
(Fig. 4B). However we found a selective impairment of glycolysis in GBM1 compared with NP1 
cells as indicated by the differential 13C label enrichment of dihydroxyacetone phosphate 
(DHAP; Fig. 4C), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP; Fig. 4D), glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P; Fig. 
4E), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP; Fig. 4F) and lactate (Fig. 4G). An unlabeled metabolite is 
detected as the molecular ion (M0) in the mass spectrum. Each additional 13C-carbon atom 
introduced to the specific molecule gives rise to an increase in mass of 1 (M1, M2, M3, and so 
forth). The incorporation of the 13C-label into the M2 isotopologues of TCA cycle intermediates 
 8 
 
citrate (Fig. 4H), succinate (Fig. 4I), and malate (Fig. 4K) significantly decreased in KHS101-
treated GBM1 cells (P<0.05), whereas enrichment of these metabolites remained unchanged in 
NP1 cells, indicating a selective perturbation of label enrichment through glycolysis and 
pyruvate dehydrogenase-initiated TCA cycle reactions. After 24 hours of KHS101 treatment, 
total cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were reduced (≥50%) in GBM1 compared 
with NP1 cells (fig. S3B). In addition, we noted a higher fractional enrichment of the M1 
isotopologues of citrate (Fig. 4H), succinate (Fig. 4I), fumarate (Fig 4J) and malate (Fig 4K) in 
control GBM versus NP1 cells, which was selectively reduced by KHS101 in GBM1 cells.  
Relative enrichment of the M3 isotopologues of TCA cycle intermediates was elevated in GBM1 
versus NP1 cells (Fig. 4 H, I, J, and K). Increased labelling of M3 aspartate (a proxy for 
oxaloacetate), through the action of pyruvate carboxylase, was observed in KHS101-treated 
GBM cells (Fig 4L). In summary, these findings indicate that KHS101 selectively impairs 
aerobic glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration-dependent, and malic enzyme-dependent 
biosynthetic pathways in GBM cells. 
 
KHS101 interacts with HSPD1 in GBM cells  
Mitochondrial dynamics are important mediators of tumorigenesis and cancer stem cell 
phenotypes (23, 25). To elucidate the cellular target(s) underlying the reduced mitochondrial and 
metabolic capacity in KHS101-treated GBM cells, we investigated the physical interaction of 
KHS101 with potential cellular protein(s) using an established affinity-based target identification 
protocol (17). The photoaffinity probe KHS101-BP (a KHS101 derivative containing a 
benzophenone moiety and an alkyne substituent) and KHS101 showed similar bioactivity in 
GBM cells (fig. S5). A distinct KHS101-BP-protein complex of ~60 kDa (isoelectric point ~5.7) 
appeared reduced by >50% in presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled KHS101, and was 
therefore used for examination of KHS101-interacting protein (Fig. 5A). Proteomics analysis 
revealed that the KHS101-BP-bound protein corresponded to the mitochondrial 60 kDa heat 
shock protein 1 (HSPD1).  
A specific interaction between KHS101 and HSPD1 was further observed by in vitro 
pull-down experiments using human recombinant HSPD1 protein (Fig. 5B). Cellular 
fractionation followed by Western blot analysis showed that HSPD1 was overexpressed in 
GBM1 cells and predominantly localized to the mitochondria as indicated by a marked increase 
 9 
 
in the mitochondrial to cytoplasmic ratio compared with NP1 cells (P<0.01; Fig. 5C). Reduction 
of HSPD1 expression by lentiviral short hairpin (sh)RNA in GBM1 cells by 50-65% (P<0.01; 
fig. S6A) was associated with an increase in mRNA expression of stress-inducible chaperone 
Heat Shock Protein Family A (Hsp70) Member 1A (HSPA1A; >5-fold; P<0.05), which has been 
linked to mitochondrial proteostasis in cancer cells (fig. S6B) (39). In agreement with a reported 
role for HSPD1 in glioma cell line proliferation (40), a decline in mitochondrial 
activity/OXPHOS (~50%; fig. S6C), and a significant decrease in proliferation (~50%, 
P<0.0001), was observed in the HSPD1 shRNA-harboring (low HSPD1-expressing) GBM1 cells 
(fig. S6D; note that KHS101 addition further reduced the growth of HSPD1 knockdown GBM1 
cells). KHS101 altered neither HSPD1 protein levels nor HSPD1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5D, 
and E, and fig. S6E), suggesting that the KHS101-GBM cytotoxicity is independent of HSPD1 
mRNA/protein downregulation. 
 
KHS101 aggregates HSPD1 and metabolic enzymes in GBM cells promoting their metabolic 
exhaustion 
To investigate whether KHS101 directly inhibits HSPD1 function, HSPD1/Heat Shock 
Protein Family E (Hsp10) Member 1 (HSPE1) chaperonin complex activity was assessed upon 
KHS101 addition in vitro. A concentration-dependent inhibition of HSPD1-dependent substrate 
re-folding was readily detected in presence of KHS101 (IC50=14.4 µM) (Fig. 6A). Re-folding 
activity remained unaffected upon addition of a structurally closely related KHS101 analog 
(HB072; Fig. 6B, file S3), which was phenotypically-inactive in GBM cells (fig. S7A). In 
contrast, the mitochondrial HSPD1-targeting natural product myrtucommulone (MC (41)) 
elicited a concentration dependent decrease in HSPD1/HSPE1 re-folding activity (Fig. 6B). 
Moreover, MC and KHS101 shared mitochondrial and bioenergetic stress-promoting activities as 
observed by reduced mitochondrial respiration capacity, upregulation of DNA Damage Inducible 
Transcript 3 (DDIT3) and HMOX1 mRNA, and ATP depletion (fig. S7, B to D). Consistently, 
MC recapitulated the KHS101-induced autophagy and cell death phenotype in GBM cells (fig. 
S7, E and F).     
We next asked whether KHS101 disrupts mitochondrial HSPD1 function in a cell-based 
in vitro system. To this end, we quantified protein aggregation by fractionation of detergent-
insoluble mitochondrial proteins in GBM1 compared with NP1 cells upon compound addition. 
 10 
 
Silver staining indicated that aggregated proteins (pellet) were enriched by ~4-fold (P<0.01), 
whereas soluble protein enrichment was not significantly affected in GBM1 compared with NP1 
cells 1 hour after KHS101 treatment (Fig. 6C). Proteomics analysis determined that HSPD1 and 
enzymes with functions in glycolysis (Aldolase, Fructose-Bisphosphate A, ALDOA), TCA cycle 
(Dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase 
complex, DLST), OXPHOS (ATP Synthase F1 Subunit Alpha, ATP5A1), and mitochondrial 
integrity (Lon Peptidase 1, Mitochondrial, LONP1 (42)) were specifically enriched in the 
aggregated protein fractions of GBM1 compared to NP1 cells (table S2). Consistently, the 
aggregated proteins readily integrated into a predicted HSPD1-centered protein-protein 
interaction network using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins 
(STRING; (43); Fig. 6D). In addition to mitochondrial fractionation, a quantitative global 
proteomics analysis of KHS101-treated GBM1 cells (data deposited at the PRoteomics 
IDEntifications (PRIDE) database , identifier PXD009429) showed that the following aggregated 
proteins of the predicted HSPD1 interaction network were significantly downregulated 1-hour 
after KHS101 treatment (P<7.5 x 10-7): DLST, ATP5A1, Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 3 
(SLC25A3), ALDOA, Pyruvate Kinase M1/2 (PKM2), Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase 2, 
Mitochondrial (PCK2), Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), Phosphoglycerate 
Dehydrogenase (PHGDH), HSPD1, Heat Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family Class B Member 1 
(HSP90AB1), and LONP1 (Fig. 6E and file S3). Changes in the KHS101-regulated GBM 
proteome were time-dependent as indicated by PCA and differential peptide abundances (fig. S8, 
A and B). Global protein abundance was decreased by KHS101 at both the 1-hour and 12-hour 
time points. Compared with t0, 9500 and 9607 polypeptides were significantly downregulated 
(P≤0.05), whereas only 93 and 16 proteins were markedly upregulated at the 1- and 12-hour time 
points, respectively (Fig. 6E and fig. S8C, and file S3). Protein set enrichment analysis indicated 
that mitochondrial rather than endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways were affected (Fig. 6E, fig. 
S8C, file S3). In summary, these findings corroborate a link between the KHS101-mediated 
disruption of mitochondrial HSPD1 activity and metabolic stress in GBM cells. 
 
KHS101 attenuates tumor growth and invasion in vivo 
To investigate the potential pharmacological effects of KHS101 on GBM in vivo, 
xenograft tumors were allowed to establish for 6 weeks after injection of GBM1 cells (1 x 105 
 11 
 
cells) into the forebrain striatum and treated with vehicle or KHS101 for 10 days (s.c., 6 mg/kg, 
twice daily). Subsequently, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)/Nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) and Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) autofluorescence 
(AF; fig. S9A) was examined as an indicator of metabolic and mitochondrial activity in situ (44). 
Analysis of tumor tissue sections showed that the AF signal area was predominantly cytoplasmic 
and significantly upregulated after systemic delivery of KHS101 compared with the vehicle 
control (P<0.01; Fig. 7A and fig. S9, A and B). Consistently, fluorescence-lifetime imaging 
microscopy (FLIM) revealed an elevated cytoplasmic fluorescence (corresponding to free 
NAD(P)H)) 1 hour after KHS101 addition in cultured GBM1 cells (fig. S9C).  
To examine whether the observed mitochondrial/redox anomaly was associated with 
reduced tumor progression, we adapted the KHS101 dosing regimen from previous neurogenesis 
work in rats (17) using a 10-week tumor treatment strategy (s.c., 6 mg/kg, twice a day, and bi-
weekly treatment alternating five and three treatment days per week). Immunohistological 
analysis of the vehicle (V)- and KHS101 (K)-treated tumors at the 16-week endpoint showed an 
increase in HK2-positive tumor area in KHS-treated tumors (Fig. 7B and fig. S10A), which was 
in line with the KHS101-induced increase in HK2 mRNA in GBM cell cultures. Concomitantly, 
tumor cell proliferation was markedly reduced in KHS101-treated tumors (~2-fold) as assessed 
by MKI67 staining (Fig. 7B and fig. S10A). This finding was consistent with a homogenous 
decrease in MKI67 expression and abrogation of clonal growth capacity in individually profiled 
GBM1 cells in vitro (Fig. 7, C and D). KHS101-treated tumors showed signs of elevated cell 
death (reduced cellularity/increased pyknosis) compared with tumors treated with vehicle control 
(Fig. 7E and fig. S10B). The highly invasive phenotype of the GBM1 xenograft tumor model 
(14) enabled quantification of caudal tumor expansion and tumor cell migration across the 
corpus callosum into the contralateral hemisphere (a pathological hallmark of advanced GBM). 
KHS101 treatment markedly reduced both frontal-to-caudal tumor expansion (Fig. 7F), and 
corpus callosum invasion of Vimentin-positive GBM1 cells (≥2-fold) (Fig. 7G). Histological 
analysis demonstrated preserved hepatic architecture in KHS101-treated animals (fig. S10C). 
 
KHS101 treatment increases survival of xenograft tumor-bearing mice  
Consistent with the notion of a pro-tumorigenic effect of elevated HSPD1 (45), 
exploration of the REpository of Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa set (REMBRANDT (46); 
 12 
 
http://www.betastasis.com/glioma/rembrandt/) suggested thatHSPD1 mRNA expression 
negatively correlated with glioma survival (Fig. 8A). Accordingly, we further investigated 
whether KHS101 prolonged survival in a xenograft model of GBM. To this end, we used a giant 
cell GBM-based model, established with exclusively in vivo-propagated primary cells (GBMX1; 
onset of morbidity: 10-13 weeks). We found that the survival of animals carrying GBMX1-
tumors (established 2 or 6 weeks before treatment) was markedly increased by the KHS101 
treatment regimen for 10 weeks (Fig. 8B). None of the mice had to be removed from the study 
due to adverse side effects of the treatment. An additional experiment using a continuous 
KHS101 treatment regime until the experimental endpoints, also showed a marked increase in 
the survival of GBMX1-bearing animals (Fig. 8C). Histological endpoint analysis of KHS101- 
and vehicle-treated animals confirmed a significantly decreased tumor size in KHS101-treated 
mice (~2-fold, P<0.01; Fig. 8D). In summary, these results indicate significant anti-GBM effects 
of KHS101 in vivo, without discernible adverse toxicity. 
 
Discussion  
GBM is a devastating cancer with limited treatment options and correspondingly poor 
patient outcomes. We began our investigation with the hypothesis that GBM tumor stem cell-like 
cells might be eradicated by a small molecule-mediated pro-differentiation phenotype (12). In 
this context, the compound KHS101 shows BBB penetrability as well as non-toxic neuronal 
differentiation properties by targeting TACC3 (17, 47). However, instead of a ‘forced’ pro-
differentiation phenotype that reduces GBM tumorigenicity in a cell death-independent manner 
(14, 29), we observed a cytotoxic lethal GBM cell fate, characterized by autophagy-driven 
cellular self-destruction.  
One challenge for GBM target discovery and validation is to incorporate the ever-
changing composition of molecularly and phenotypically diverse tumor cell populations (26, 27, 
48) into preclinical disease modeling. To this end, transcriptional diversity among and within our 
six patient-derived models was revealed by microfluidic single cell qRT-PCR analysis. We 
adapted computational approaches that robustly indicated classical, proneural, and mesenchymal 
GBM subtype compartments in our GBM models, that were independent of GBM subtype 
features, pro-differentiation signaling (14, 29), low oxygen culture conditions, and parental 
tumor origin (primary versus recurrent GBM, and MGMT methylation status).  
 13 
 
Consistent with previous work (18), KHS101 treatment decreased endogenous TACC3 
protein in GBM cells over time. The resulting TACC3 degradation kinetics (onset �18 hours) 
was not involved in the more rapidly-evolving autophagy and cytoplasmic degradation processes 
in GBM cells. However, the KHS101-mediated decrease in TACC3 levels may have contributed 
to the alterations in GBM cell cycle and mitotic pathways as indicated by microarray gene 
expression analysis 24 hours after KHS101 addition. KHS101-induced gene expression changes 
(observed for SLC2A1, HK2, HMOX1, and DDIT3) suggested a yet unexplored KHS101 
bioactivity in regards to metabolic and mitochondrial pathway perturbation. Consistent with the 
notion that altered energy metabolism is a hallmark of cancers and a potential tumor cell 
vulnerability (24), the GBM cell models persistently exhibited elevated bioenergetic demands 
compared with NP and astrocyte cell lines. Both intracellular and extracellular metabolic 
phenotyping indicated that KHS101 disrupted GBM cell energy metabolism. Glucose transporter 
gene expression (SLC2A1 and SLC2A3) was increased in GBM cells after a 24-hour treatment 
period. Moreover, HK2 expression increased after KHS101 treatment in vitro and in vivo. HK2 
is a key enzyme for enhanced glucose turnover that depends on ATP availability (32), which was 
reduced in KHS101-treated GBM cells at the 24-hour time point. Fractional enrichment of 
glucose-derived carbon through glycolysis and the TCA cycle was impaired in the GBM cells 
and the latter was indicated by a reduction in 13C-label incorporation into the M2 isotopologues 
of TCA cycle intermediates. The M1 isotopologues of TCA cycle intermediates were likely 
derived from the generation of M1-labelled pyruvate, by the action of malic enzyme 1 (ME1), 
which subsequently re-enters the TCA cycle either by the action of pyruvate carboxylase or the 
reverse ME1 reaction. ME1 is overexpressed in cancer cells to meet redox balancing and lipid 
biosynthetic demands, and its inhibition has been suggested to impair cancer cell growth (49). 
Increased labeling of M3 aspartate (a proxy for oxaloacetate) may represent a compensatory 
carbon entry into the TCA cycle in KHS101-treated GBM cells via increased, pyruvate 
carboxylase-mediated, pyruvate anaplerosis, which has previously been described in lung 
metastases (50). Consistent with bioenergetic changes, stress response genes (DDIT3 and 
HMOX1 indicating mitochondrial stress in glioma depending on the experimental context (51, 
52)) were upregulated by KHS101. Moreover, a NAD(P)H cytoplasmic accumulation (indicating 
mitochondrial/redox anomalies (44, 53)) was observed in GBM cells and xenograft tumors upon 
KHS101 treatment. It is plausible that, concomitant with KHS101-induced advances in 
 14 
 
bioenergetic insufficiencies, cellular stress evolved and spread across the GBM cell organelle 
system, for example via the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (as indicated by the 
upregulation of DDIT3 and TRIB3 mRNA expression in treated GBM1 cells; (54, 55)).  
 In agreement with a KHS101 interference with mitochondrial dynamics, affinity-based 
target identification suggested a physical interaction between KHS101 and the mitochondrial 
chaperone HSPD1 in GBM cells. The reduction of HSPD1 using shRNAs expectedly affected 
GBM cell growth and mitochondrial capacity (40), and a potential compensation for reduced 
HSPD1 expression via HSPA1A mRNA upregulation was observed. However, KHS101 did not 
affect cellular HSPD1 mRNA and protein levels, highlighting the importance of recognizing 
differences between genetic and small-molecule target inhibition (reviewed in (56)). As affinity-
based target identification provides important, but not sufficient, evidence for small molecule 
mechanisms of action investigations (9), we sought to address whether KHS101 disrupted 
HSPD1 function. The activity of the HSPD1/HSPE1 complex was reduced by KHS101 in a 
concentration-dependent fashion in vitro. A structurally-related KHS101 analog that did not 
affect HSPD1/HSPE1 chaperone activity (HB072), remained phenotypically-inactive in GBM 
cells. In contrast, a structurally-unrelated positive control for mitochondrial HSPD1 inhibition 
((MC; (57)), fully recapitulated the KHS101-induced GBM cell cytotoxicity.  
A selective aggregation of HSPD1 and its potential client proteins was observed in GBM 
cells 1 hour after KHS101 addition. The acute deregulation of a predicted HSPD1-centered 
enzymatic network, including ALDOA (regulating glycolysis), DLST (regulating TCA cycle), 
ATP5A1 (regulating OXPHOS), and the chaperone LONP1 (regulating mitochondrial integrity 
in cancer cells (42) provides an explanation for the rapidly-evolving metabolic stress that was not 
uniquely mitochondrial. Mitochondrial fractionation of aggregated ALDOA and PKM2 proteins 
suggests close association of these enzymes with GBM cell mitochondria, a phenomenon 
reported for HK2 in the cancer cell context (32). 
Selective effects of KHS101 towards brain cancer cells were observed throughout our 
study at protein, metabolite, mRNA, and organelle levels. Cellular self-degradation processes 
were markedly pronounced in GBM but not NP cells 12 hours after KHS101 treatment. The loss 
of stem cell-like features and the significant increase in apoptotic cell death over time (>24 
hours) indicates that GBM cells failed to compensate for the KHS101-mediated impairment of 
critical metabolic and mitochondrial fitness and ATP production. Taken together, these results 
 15 
 
support a causative relationship between the KHS101-induced HSPD1 disruption and a lethal 
GBM cellular phenotype.  
KHS101 activity has not been associated with toxicity in non-cancer contexts in vitro and 
in vivo  (17, 18, 47, 58). KHS101 showed favorable in vivo properties including accelerated 
neuronal differentiation in adult rats (without affecting apoptosis of brain cells (17, 47)). 
Consistent with the specific KHS101 cytotoxicity in GBM compared with NP cells, the 
compound markedly decreased the progression of established xenograft tumors, whereas adverse 
effects (liver toxicity) were not observed in mice after prolonged (10-week) systemic 
administration.  
There are some limitations to our study. KHS101 is an experimental/preclinical 
compound that may require chemical and pharmacological optimization before KHS101-like 
bioactivities can be tested in clinical applications. The exact molecular nature of the KHS101-
HSPD1 interaction, and the role of HSPD1 in the metabolic reprogramming that drives brain 
tumorigenesis remain to be further investigated.  
  In summary, this experimental small molecule phenotype and target profiling study 
identifies HSPD1 enzymatic function as a specific molecular vulnerability linked to energy 
metabolism in GBM cell models. A lethal GBM cell fate can be selectively triggered in a 
heterogeneous spectrum of GBM cells by a single agent. These findings highlight the potential 
for using KHS101-like compounds for therapeutic developments.  
 
 
Materials and Methods 
Study design 
Our objective was to characterize the effect of the synthetic small molecule KHS101 in 
the GBM cellular context in vitro and in vivo. The control and treatment groups and the number 
of biological replicates (sample sizes) for each experiment are specified in the figure legends. 
For in vivo tumor xenograft studies, no power analysis was performed to predetermine the 
sample size, animals were randomly allocated to the control and treatment groups and housed 
together to minimize environmental differences and experimental bias. Analysis of endpoint 
readouts were carried out in a blinded fashion.        
Statistical analysis  
 16 
 
A minimum of 3 independent biological repeats were analyzed using the student’s t-test 
(two tailed, equal variance), One-way or two-way ANOVA (Tukey post-hoc), or Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure (for false discovery rates) as specified in the figure legends. Data were 
expressed as mean ± SD. One biological repeat comprised a minimum of 3 technical replicates. 
Approximate normal distribution of data was assumed. For xenograft tumor analysis, the Mann-
Whitney U-test was used (one tailed). For Kaplan-Meier xenograft tumor analysis, the 
significance was calculated using the log-rank test.
