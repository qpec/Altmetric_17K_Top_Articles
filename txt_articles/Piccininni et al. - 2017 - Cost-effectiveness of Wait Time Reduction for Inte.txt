Cost-effectiveness of Wait Time Reduction for Intensive
Behavioral Intervention Services in Ontario, Canada
Caroline Piccininni, BSc; Lise Bisnaire, PhD; Melanie Penner, MSc, MD, FRCPC
IMPORTANCE Earlier access to intensive behavioral intervention (IBI) is associated with
improved outcomes for children with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, there
are long waiting times for this program. No analyses have been performed modeling the
cost-effectiveness of wait time reduction for IBI.
OBJECTIVES To model the starting age for IBI with reduced wait time (RWT) (by half) and
eliminated wait time (EWT), and perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing RWT and
EWT with current wait time (CWT) from government and societal perspectives.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Published waiting times were used to model the mean
starting age for IBI for CWT, RWT, and EWT in children diagnosed with severe ASD who were
treated at Ontario’
s Autism Intervention Program. Inputs were loaded into a decision analytic
model, with an annual discount rate of 3% applied. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs) were determined. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to
assess the effect of model uncertainty. We used data from the year 2012 (January 1 through
December 31) provided from the Children’
s Hospital of Eastern Ontario IBI center for the
starting ages. Data analysis was done from May through July 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome was independence measured in
dependency-free life-years (DFLYs) to 65 years of age. To derive this, expected IQ was
modeled based on probability of early (age <4 years) or late (age �4 years) access to IBI.
Probabilities of having an IQ in the normal (�70) or intellectual disability (<70) range were
calculated. The IQ strata were assigned probabilities of achieving an independent (60 DFLYs),
semidependent (30 DFLYs), or dependent (0 DFLYs) outcome. Costs were calculated for
provincial government and societal perspectives in Canadian dollars (Can$1 = US$0.78).
RESULTS The mean starting ages for IBI were 5.24 years for CWT, 3.89 years for RWT, and 2.71
years for EWT. From the provincial government perspective, EWT was the dominant strategy,
generating the most DFLYs for Can$53 000 less per individual to 65 years of age than CWT.
From the societal perspective, EWT produced lifetime savings of Can$267 000 per individual
compared with CWT. The ICERs were most sensitive to uncertainty in the starting age for IBI
and in achieving a normal IQ based on starting age.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study predicts the long-term effect of the current
disparity between IBI service needs and the amount of IBI being delivered in the province of
Ontario. The results suggest that providing timely access optimizes IBI outcomes, improves
future independence, and lessens costs from provincial and societal perspectives.

A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder with core symptoms of impairment in so-
cial interaction and restricted interests and behaviors.1
During the past 2 decades, increasing rates of ASD diagnosis
have been reported, causing the estimated prevalence in North
Americatoincreaseto1in68children.2Asthispopulationcon-
tinues to increase, more children with ASD are placed on wait-
ing lists, hindering access to ASD interventions.
The delivery of intensive behavioral intervention (IBI) has
been affected by the increase in the population with ASD. In-
tensive behavioral intervention is an ASD therapy based on the
principles of applied behavior analysis and is delivered one on
one by a trained therapist for 20 hours or more weekly.3 The
goals of IBI are to facilitate skill acquisition, remove barriers
tolearning,andincreasequalityoflife.4Earlyinterventionwith
IBI during the preschool years is effective in children with ASD
for improvement of developmental trajectory and maximiza-
tion of individual potential.3,5 Accessing IBI and other behav-
ioral therapies at younger ages has been associated with sig-
nificantly better treatment outcomes compared with access at
older ages.6-9
The Canadian province of Ontario offers the publicly
fundedAutismInterventionProgramforchildrenwithASD“to-
ward the severe end of the spectrum,”10(p 8) with each site de-
termining participant eligibility based on clinical impres-
sions of ASD severity. The system in Ontario is relevant in a
broadercontextasanexampleofapubliclyfundedsystemthat
provides community-based IBI services. As part of this pro-
gram, children receive IBI for a mean of 23 hours each week
for a mean of 2 years.10 In an evaluation of this program, chil-
dren who began IBI before 4 years of age had lower autism
symptom severity scores, higher scores on measures of adap-
tive skills, and higher IQ gains at the end of treatment com-
pared with children who began IBI at older than 4 years.6
The mean wait time for IBI across Ontario is 2.7 years, de-
laying access to intervention for thousands of children.11 The
waiting lists are maintained in chronological order based on
date of referral to the program.10 Increases in waiting lists con-
tinually surpass increases in program funding, such that most
eligible children start IBI months or years after it is consid-
ered most effective, with approximately 75% of eligible chil-
dren beginning IBI at older than 6 years.12
In addition to costs directly associated with intervention,
ASD comes with high costs over the lifetime, particularly in
educational and social supports.13 The per capita lifetime cost
to society for an individual with ASD has been estimated to ex-
ceed $3 million.13-15 Improving outcomes via increased early
access to treatment is hypothesized to reduce the need for ser-
vices and supports later in life. In 2006, a cost-effectiveness
analysis16 evaluated the cost-effectiveness of expanding On-
tario’s Autism Intervention Program to all children with ASD
in the province and reported cost savings with program ex-
pansion. A more recent cost-effectiveness analysis compared
prediagnosis intervention with Ontario’s Autism Interven-
tion Program and found the potential for lifetime cost sav-
ings with the addition of prediagnosis interventions.17 To
our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the lifetime cost-
effectiveness of reducing wait times for IBI to yield earlier
access for the eligible population of children with more
severe ASD. Such evidence is urgently needed to inform
policy decisions for governments considering investing in
this population.
This analysis had 2 objectives. The first was to determine
thechangeinmeanstartingageforIBIinOntariowithwaittime
reduction (by half) and elimination. The second was to per-
form a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the lifetime costs
and projected dependency-free life-years (DFLYs) for re-
duced wait time (RWT) and eliminated wait time (EWT) com-
pared with current wait time (CWT) from provincial and so-
cietal perspectives.
Methods
We used data from the year 2012 (January 1 through Decem-
ber 31) provided from the Children’s Hospital of Eastern On-
tario IBI center for the starting ages. Data analysis was done
from May through July 2015. Study investigators consulted
withtheresearchethicsboardattheChildren'sHospitalofEast-
ern Ontario about the use of age distribution data from their
IBI program. The board confirmed that research ethics ap-
proval was not necessary for the use of these data.

Key Points
Question What are the costs and effects on independence of
decreasing the wait time for intensive behavioral intervention (IBI)
for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Ontario, Canada?
Findings A cost-effectiveness analysis modeled the lifetime costs
and independence per person with ASD based on the current IBI
wait time of 32 months, a wait time reduced by half, and no wait
time. Eliminating the wait time resulted in more independence and
substantial savings to the government (Can$53 000 per person
with ASD) and society (Can$267 000 per person with ASD).
Meaning Improved access to IBI for ASD results in long-term
substantial savings to governments and society.

was a conservative allowance for the period between deter-
mination of eligibility and initiation of IBI.
Determination of Age at IBI Entry for Different Wait Times
Data for the starting age for IBI were obtained from the Eastern
Ontario region and were used to determine the mean starting
age for IBI under each of the 3 wait-time scenarios. A normal
distribution was fit to the frequency distribution of ages of the
73childrenbeginningIBIin2012(mean[SD]age,5.2[0.9]years),
which corresponded to the year of the most recently pub-
lished data on provincial wait times.11 For subsequent calcula-
tions, it was assumed that the ages of children on the waiting
list would remain normally distributed as the wait time was re-
duced. Mean age at referral was calculated as the difference be-
tween the reported mean IBI starting age in 2012 and CWT. As-
sumingthatthemeanageatreferralwouldremainconstantwith
changes in wait time, the mean starting ages for IBI with RWT
and EWT were determined by adding this age to the length of
the reduced mean wait time and 2 months, respectively.
Cost-effectiveness Analysis
Type of Evaluation
This study used a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the
relative costs and effects of 3 possible wait-time lengths (CWT,
RWT, and EWT) in the provincial and societal context.
Target Population
The target population for this study was children with severe
ASD determined eligible to receive IBI through Ontario’s Au-
tism Intervention Program. Children with mild and moderate
ASD were excluded from the models.
Perspective
Costs were determined from the perspectives of the provin-
cial government and society. Provincial government costs in-
cluded public funding for education, health, and social ser-
vices. The societal perspective is a broader perspective that
adds costs to families, including costs associated with care-
giving and lost productivity.
Measurement of Effectiveness
The outcome modeled was independence measured in DFLYs,
previously defined as years of life with a similar level of inde-
pendence as would be expected from a typically developing
individual.17 Predictions for stratification into the final out-
come categories were based on posttreatment IQ scores for the
younger and older age groups.6 Specifically, the probability of
achieving an IQ score greater than 70 was assigned for each age
group and then a probability of achieving an independent (60
DFLYs), semidependent (30 DFLYs), or dependent outcome (0
DFLYs) was assigned for each IQ group.16,17 IQ was used be-
causeitistheonlyavailablepost-IBIoutcomemeasurethathas
beenreportedtopredictfuturedependenceintheliterature.18,19
Time Horizon
The time horizon over which costs and DFLYs were evaluated
was from the mean age at determination of eligibility for IBI
to 65 years of age as reported previously in the literature.16,17,20
Resource Use and Costs
A complete breakdown of sources used to determine re-
source use and costs attributable to ASD is given in the Table.
All costs are in Canadian dollars, which is the currency to be
used throughout this article (Can$1 = $US0.78). The cost of IBI
was valued at $56 000 per child per year, with regional varia-
tion from $50 800 to $67 000, which was the cost reported in
2013.12 Intensive behavioral intervention was assumed to have
a mean duration of 2 years. Other costs to the provincial gov-
ernment included ASD-related health care costs to 65 years of
age for all individuals and additional costs of transition ser-
vices, special education, supported employment, the Special
Services at Home program (which provides funding for chil-
dren with developmental needs), the Passport program for
semidependent and dependent individuals (which provides
funding for adults with developmental disabilities), and re-
spite care for dependent individuals.12,16,21,23 Only those with
a semidependent or dependent outcome were assumed to par-
ticipate in special education and receive adult developmen-
tal disability supports.
Thesocietalperspectivealsofactoredintheestimatedcosts
of productivity loss and caregiving. The major source of lost
productivity for individuals in the target population is inabil-
ity to participate in the workforce for dependent individuals
and limited ability for semidependent individuals.27,28 As in
previous analyses,16,17 productivity loss was obtained based
on the mean national wage and projected working hours per
week for each outcome with dependent individuals assumed
not to work, semidependent individuals assumed to be em-
ployed for 20 hours per week, and independent individuals as-
sumed to be employed for 40 hours per week. Caregiver costs
were valued based on the mean hourly salary of a social as-
sistant and total estimated hours of caregiving for each
outcome.17,20,25 The societal perspective excluded funds that
were directly transferred from the government to families,
namely, the costs of the Special Services at Home program and
supported employment.
Discount Rates
An annual discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and
DFLYs occurring in the future. Results were also analyzed
using discount rates ranging from 0% to 5% in 1-way sensitiv-
ity analyses.

months taken from the normal distribution of ages of chil-
dren beginning IBI in 2012. Cost-effectiveness frontiers were
created for each analysis, and incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each strategy from both
perspectives.

Variability and Uncertainty
The robustness of model outputs to uncertainty in key param-
eters was assessed using 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity
analyses(PSAs).One-waysensitivityanalysesevaluatedmodel
outputs in response to high and low parameter values, which
were derived from 95% CIs for all parameters (unless other-
wise indicated) (Table). The influence of each input in deter-
mining variation in model outputs is shown in Tornado dia-
gram. The PSAs were performed using 10 000 Monte Carlo
simulations to demonstrate the effects of joint parameter un-
certainty under the assumptions of normal distributions for
IBI starting age and post-IBI IQ and β-distributions for other
probabilities related to effectiveness of the intervention. The
PSA results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness
scatterplots.
Results
Age at IBI Entry
The mean starting ages were determined to be 5.24 years for
the CWT scenario, 3.89 years for the RWT scenario, and 2.71
years for the EWT scenario. Assuming a normal distribution
for probability of accessing IBI before 4 years of age, the mean
ages for each scenario corresponded to 9.6% accessing IBI
before 4 years of age with CWT, 54.8% with RWT, and 91.8%
with EWT.
Cost-effectiveness Analysis:
Provincial Government Perspective
From the perspective of the provincial government, the over-
all findings revealed decreasing total costs and increasing ef-
fectiveness as the probability of early access to IBI increased.
These results are presented on a cost-effectiveness frontier in
Figure 2. The mean discounted cost of CWT was $742 488 per
individual with 3.75 DFLYs generated to 65 years of age. Halv-
ing the wait time (RWT) decreased the cost to $713 182 and in-
creased the number of DFLYs generated to 5.03. The EWT sce-
nario had the lowest cost and highest effectiveness, costing
$689 512 and generating 6.17 DFLYs. Thus, the EWT scenario
was the dominant strategy. The negative ICERs are indicative
of absolute dominance, which occurs when a strategy is more
effective and less costly than the others. The EWT scenario re-
sulted in savings of $52 976 per individual over a lifetime com-
pared with the CWT scenario.
Sensitivity Analysis: Provincial Government Perspective
In 1-way sensitivity analyses, the calculated ICERs were most
influenced by uncertainty relating to the probability of achiev-
ing a posttreatment IQ score greater than 70 based on IBI start-
ing age, the probability of achieving an independent outcome
when IQ was greater than 70, and IBI starting age (Figure 3).
The calculated ICERs remained negative for the range of pos-
sible values for all variables. When analyzed using PSA, there
was a large spread of incremental cost and effectiveness

results, reflecting the degree of uncertainty in the effective-
ness inputs. The results of the multiway PSA for EWT com-
pared with CWT are presented in Figure 4, along with a cost-
effectivenessacceptabilitycurve(eFigure1intheSupplement).
Cost-effectiveness Analysis: Societal Perspective
The DFLYs generated for each of the 3 wait time scenarios were
identical to the provincial perspective. Costs were notably
higher, with CWT at $3 267 500, RWT at $3 120 700, and EWT
at $3 000 200. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis
from the societal perspective are shown in eFigure 2 in the
Supplement. The EWT scenario again dominated the other
strategies, resulting in cost savings of more than $267 000 per
individual over a lifetime compared with CWT.
Sensitivity Analysis: Societal Perspective
Similar to the provincial perspective, the societal ICER out-
puts were most sensitive to uncertainty surrounding the
probability of achieving a post-IBI IQ score greater than 70
based on age in 1-way sensitivity analyses. In addition, the
ICERs calculated from the societal perspective were influ-
enced by uncertainty in the cost associated with caregiving
for adults with a dependent outcome. The results of the
PSAs were also similar to the provincial perspective. The
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve revealed eliminated
wait time to be the preferred strategy at all levels of willing-
ness to pay.
Discussion
Cost-effectiveness analyses are undertaken as an aid to
determine how to use limited resources efficiently. Inter-
vention strategies are recommended when additional effec-
tiveness is achieved at a reasonable additional cost com-
pared with the status quo.29 This analysis, the first to model
the economic effect of wait times, revealed that eliminating

wait times for IBI was the dominant strategy over the CWT
and halving the wait time from both provincial and societal
perspectives. Incremental reductions in wait time were
associated with gains in independence and lower projected
lifetime costs.
Evidence consistently indicates that children who re-
ceive IBI at younger ages make greater gains than their older
counterparts.6-9Thisanalysisincorporatesthesubstantialcosts
associated with ASD, indicating that the long-term cost bur-
den on the provincial government and society is also de-
creased when children begin IBI at younger ages. The de-
creased costs result from minimizing the need for social
supports later in life, including special education, family ser-
vices, and adult disability services. Although this model was
constructed using parameters from the Ontario context, the
results are relevant to any jurisdiction providing publicly
funded early IBI.
Limitations
Although the model is based on assumptions that are consis-
tent with the current literature on IBI, there are several limi-
tations. The number of children included in the starting age
data sample was relatively small; however, variability around
this parameter was incorporated into the sensitivity analyses.
Projections of adult outcome are limited by substantial vari-
ability in post-IBI IQ and limited predictors of future inde-
pendence (beyond IQ) in the published literature. The pre-
sented model captures this variability by using large ranges
for the associated probabilities in the sensitivity analysis,
resulting in wide 95% CIs around the ICERs. Better predictors
of adult independence in the future will decrease uncertainty
in the model. These studies are critical to future economic
decision making because most ASD-related costs are in adult
services.30
The aim of this analysis was to compare incremental cost
differences among scenarios; the reported absolute costs for
eachofthescenariosarenotintendedtorepresentallASDcosts
to governments or society, which have been previously
reported.20,23,30 The model does not fully account for differ-
ences in cost between the direct service option (wherein the
child receives publicly delivered IBI) and the direct funding op-
tion (wherein the family receives funding to contract an IBI
practitioner) for IBI in Ontario, and it does not account for the
differences in proportions of families who choose each op-
tion across regions, both of which are known to exist. Re-
ported costs are higher when more families choose the direct
service option over the direct funding option.12 The range of
values used in our model attempted to capture this variation
by using the regional minimum ($50 800 per year) and maxi-
mum ($67 000 per year) costs reported in 2013.12 There also
may be differences between the direct service option and the
direct funding option relating to the amount of hours of ser-
vice received, duration of service, quality of service, and out-
of-pocket costs to families.12
This study does not analyze the effect of increasing the ab-
solute number of children with ASD who receive IBI but rather
the proportion of eligible children who receive IBI at younger
ages.Themodelassumedthatallinfrastructurecostswerecov-
eredwithinthemediancostofIBI,althoughtheremaybesome
additional start-up costs associated with program expansion,
such as staff hiring, training, and infrastructure require-
ments. An important recent development in Ontario is signifi-
cant restructuring of the Autism Intervention Program, with
children older than 4 years no longer offered an eligibility as-
sessment for the IBI intervention. As such, increased pro-
gram capacity may not be necessary to achieve wait time re-
duction. The government also pledged an additional $330
million during 3 years to increase treatment spaces and pro-

vide flexible ASD services at an individualized intensity level.31
On the basis of the calculation in this model (which does in-
clude children older than 4 years), the upfront investment re-
quired for the program expansion implicated in the EWT sce-
nario is estimated at $93 million (calculated as the product of
IBI cost and number of children currently waiting). The model
demonstrates that the return on this investment would occur
during a long period with EWT for the entire cohort of chil-
dren on waiting lists for IBI at the time of analysis (n = 1700),
resulting in cost savings of $90 059 200 for the provincial gov-
ernment and societal savings of $454 437 200.
Conclusions
This study predicts the long-term effect of the current dispar-
ity between IBI service needs and the amount of IBI being de-
livered in the province of Ontario. With waiting lists increas-
ing much faster than the number of children receiving IBI,
reducing and ideally eliminating wait times for IBI in Ontario
has the potential to result in better treatment and adult out-
comes for many children and substantial cost savings from the
perspectives of the provincial government and society.
