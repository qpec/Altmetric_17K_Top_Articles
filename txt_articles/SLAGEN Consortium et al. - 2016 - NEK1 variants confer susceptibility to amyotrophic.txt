Abstract
To identify genetic factors contributing to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we conducted 
whole-exome analyses of 1,022 index familial ALS (FALS) cases and 7,315 controls. In a new 
screening strategy, we performed gene-burden analyses trained with established ALS genes and 
identified a significant association between loss-of-function (LOF) NEK1 variants and FALS risk. 
Independently, autozygosity mapping for an isolated community in the Netherlands identified a 
NEK1 p.Arg261His variant as a candidate risk factor. Replication analyses of sporadic ALS 
(SALS) cases and independent control cohorts confirmed significant disease association for both 
p.Arg261His (10,589 samples analyzed) and NEK1 LOF variants (3,362 samples analyzed). In

 total, we observed NEK1 risk variants in nearly 3% of ALS cases. NEK1 has been linked to 
several cellular functions, including cilia formation, DNA-damage response, microtubule stability, 
neuronal morphology and axonal polarity. Our results provide new and important insights into 
ALS etiopathogenesis and genetic etiology.
In recent years, the combination of exome sequencing, segregation analysis and 
bioinformatic filtering has proven to be an effective strategy to rapidly identify new disease 
genes1. Unfortunately, this method can be difficult to apply to disorders such as ALS, for 
which late age of onset and low-to-modest variant penetrance make it difficult to obtain 
large informative multigenerational pedigrees. Owing to high genetic heterogeneity, ALS is 
also difficult to analyze using filtering methods designed to exploit unrelated patient 
groups2. Recently, we had demonstrated the utility of exome-wide rare variant burden (RVB) 
analysis as an alternate approach, identifying a replicable association between FALS risk 
and TUBA4A in a cohort of 363 cases3. In brief, RVB analysis is used to compare the 
combined frequency of rare variants in each gene in a case–control cohort. Candidate 
associations are identified by significant differences after multiple-test correction. Since this 
initial study, we extended our data set to include complete exome sequencing for 1,376 
index FALS cases and 13,883 controls. Of these, 1,022 cases and 7,315 controls met all 
required data, inter-relatedness and ancestral quality control criteria (Supplementary Figs. 1 
and 2, and Online Methods).
Successful detection of disease associations through RVB analysis can depend heavily on 
the appropriate setting of test parameters. As genetic loci often contain many alleles of no or 
low effect, prior filtering of variants based on minor allele frequency (MAF) and 
pathogenicity predictors can identify disease signatures otherwise masked by normal human 
variability. As appropriate MAF or pathogenicity predictor settings may not be obvious in 
advance, comprehensive assessment of all pursuable analysis strategies is desirable but can 
in turn introduce excessive multiple-test burden. To overcome these limitations, we 
performed 308 distinct RVB analyses of ten well-established ALS genes using 44 functional 
and 7 MAF filters (Fig. 1a). All tests included correction for gene coverage and ancestral 
covariates (Online Methods). In the final cohort, 72 cases and 0 controls harbored known 
ALS pathogenic mutations in these ten genes (Online Methods). An additional 26 cases 
harbored a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene. Tests differed in their capacity to detect 
individual known ALS genes (Supplementary Table 1), but we achieved the highest net 
sensitivity when we restricted analyses to variants with MAF < 0.001 and functional 
classifications of either nonsense, splice-altering4 or deemed deleterious by functional 
analysis through hidden Markov models (FATHMM)5. Under these settings, four genes 
exhibited disease association at exome-wide (Bonferroni-corrected P < 2.5 × 10−6) 
significance (SOD1, TARDBP, UBQLN2 and FUS), three achieved near exome-wide 
significance (TUBA4A, TBK1 and VCP), and three displayed modest to marginal disease 
association (PFN1, VAPB and OPTN) (Fig. 1b). Genes exhibiting the strongest disease 
associations included those reported as major ALS genes in population-based studies, 
whereas those exhibiting weaker associations are believed to constitute rarer causes of 
disease.

 Extension of the optimal known ALS gene parameters to all protein-coding genes identified 
one new gene displaying exome-wide significant disease association (Fig. 1b). The gene, 
NEK1 (odds ratio (OR) = 8.2, P = 1.7 × 10−6), encodes the serine/threonine kinase NIMA 
(never in mitosis gene-A)-related kinase. Retesting NEK1 under alternate analysis 
parameters identified strong disease associations across most analysis strategies, particularly 
where we included LOF (nonsense and predicted splice-altering) variants (Supplementary 
Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). We observed no evidence for systematic genomic 
inflation (� = 0.95), confounding related to sample ascertainment (Supplementary Fig. 4) or 
case–control biases in NEK1 gene coverage (Supplementary Fig. 5). Removal of samples 
carrying rare variants of known ALS genes did not influence the association (OR = 8.9, P = 
7.3 × 10−7).
In an independent line of research, we performed whole-genome sequencing for four ALS 
patients from an isolated community in the Netherlands (population < 25,000). We observed 
high inbreeding coefficients for each of the four patients, confirming their high degree of 
relatedness and supporting a restricted genetic lineage (Supplementary Fig. 6). Autozygosity 
mapping, allowing for genetic heterogeneity, identified four candidate disease variants 
occurring in detectable runs of homozygosity (ROH) (Supplementary Fig. 7). These variants 
included a p.Arg261His variant of NEK1. Two of the four SALS cases were homozygous for 
p.Arg261His and two were heterozygous, raising the possibility that even a single copy of 
the allele may increase disease risk. Clinical evaluation of the four cases did not find any 
overt differences in disease phenotype. None of the other three candidate variants exhibited 
homozygosity in multiple patients or occurred at all in more than two patients. Analysis of 
the region identified a shared p.Arg261His haplotype spanning 3 Mb in all four samples 
(Supplementary Table 3).
To validate the risk effects of p.Arg261His, we tested for disease association among 6,172 
SALS cases and 4,417 matched controls from eight countries (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9, 
and Online Methods). We genotyped this cohort using the Illumina exome chip or by whole-
genome sequencing, allowing for checking of any overlap or detectable relatedness to the 
FALS case–control cohort, which was not present. Meta-analysis of all independent 
population strata identified a clear minor allele excess in cases with a combined significance 
of P = 4.8 × 10−5 and OR = 2.4 (Fig. 2). We also observed disease association in the FALS 
case–control data (OR = 2.7, P = 1.5 × 10−3) and a meta-analysis of FALS, SALS and all 
controls combined (OR = 2.4, P = 1.2 × 10−7).
DNA availability facilitated segregation analysis of only one NEK1 LOF variant, a 
p.Arg550* variant, which we also detected in the affected mother of the identified proband. 
To validate the effect of LOF variants observed in FALS and assess any potential 
contribution to sporadic disease, we analyzed full sequencing data of the NEK1 coding 
region for 2,303 SALS cases and 1,059 controls (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Online 
Methods). RVB analysis confirmed a significant excess of LOF variants in cases (23/2,303 
SALS samples versus 0/1,059 controls, OR = 22.2, P = 1.5 × 10−4; Supplementary Table 2). 
Meta-analysis of discovery and replication LOF analyses yielded a combined significance of 
P = 3.4 × 10−8 and OR = 8.8.

 In total, we detected 120 predicted nonsynonymous NEK1 variants in FALS samples, SALS 
samples and controls. These were distributed throughout the gene including in the sequence 
encoding protein kinase domain (PKD) and six coiled-coil domains thought to be involved 
in mediating protein–protein interactions (Supplementary Fig. 3). After conditioning for 
LOF variants and p.Arg261His, we observed tentative excesses of case variants in analyses 
of rarer variant categories, but larger sample sizes will be required to confirm the 
pathogenicity beyond p.Arg261His and LOF variants (Supplementary Table 4). Analysis of 
other members of the NEK gene family (NEK2–NEK11) identified no associations in the 
FALS data set meeting multiple-test criteria (Supplementary Table 5).
Although no other gene achieved discovery significance, ten candidate loci exhibited P < 1.0 
× 10−3 in the FALS discovery analysis (Table 1). These included the gene encoding the 
SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) complex protein synataxin 12 (STX12, 
OR = 33.1, P = 9.7 × 10−5). Analysis of the SALS replication cohort identified missense 
variants in 5/2,303 cases versus 0/1,059 in controls. However, the cohort was not sufficiently 
powered to assess events of this frequency, and larger sample sizes will be required to 
establish effects on ALS risk (Supplementary Table 6). Another identified candidate gene 
was the known hereditary spastic paraplegia gene KIF5A6 (OR = 7.1, P = 4.8 × 10−4); 
however, no observed elevations in patient variant frequencies within the SALS replication 
cohort reached statistical significance (Supplementary Table 7).
NEK1 has been previously described as a candidate gene for ALS7,8. Here our findings 
show that NEK1 in fact constitutes a major ALS-associated gene with risk variants present 
in ~3% of European and European-American ALS cases. We identified LOF variants in 
1.2% of FALS samples (OR = 8.2) and 1.0% of SALS samples (OR = 22.2) versus 0.17% of 
controls, whereas we identified the p.Arg261His variant in 1.7% of FALS samples (OR = 
2.7) and 1.6% of SALS samples (OR = 2.4) versus 0.69% of controls. We identified variants 
of unknown clinical importance (missense, MAF < 0.001) in a further 1.8% of FALS 
samples and 1.3% of SALS samples versus 1.2% of controls. In comparison, risk variants in 
previously established ALS genes occur at approximately the following percentages: 
C9orf72, <10%; SOD1, <2%; TARDBP, <1%; FUS, <1%; and others, <<1% or 
uncertain9–12. However, caution must be taken when comparing the frequency of variants or 
mutations that differ in penetrance (i.e., highly penetrant mutations to lower-penetrance risk 
variants). Furthermore, assessment of the true odds ratio for variants in a gene may be 
difficult because of the presence of neutral variants that dilute out the observed effect. The 
actual odds ratio may therefore be even higher for specific subsets of patient variants. The 
LOF variants in NEK1 displayed a higher odds ratio relative to p.Arg261His. The 
p.Arg261His variant occurs adjacent to the protein kinase domain and is classified as 
deleterious by most bioinformatic prediction algorithms (SIFT, PolyPhen, LRT, 
MutationTaster, Mutation Assessor, PROVEAN, CADD, GERP and SiPhy). One model to 
account for the difference in p.Arg261His and LOF variant toxicity could be a correlation 
between phenotypic expression and the predicted extent of NEK1 LOF. This model would 
also be consistent with previous findings that homozygosity for NEK1 LOF variants causes 
a severe developmental phenotype; short rib polydactyly syndrome type II (SRPS)13. In the 
current study, no individuals carried multiple LOF alleles. However, in SRPS, homozygous

 carriers of NEK1 LOF variants have been reported to exhibit a 64% reduction of NEK1 
mRNA levels whereas unaffected heterozygous parents exhibit a 30–40% reduction13.
NEK1 represents one of 11 members of the highly conserved NIMA kinase family, which 
has conserved functions in cell-cycle progression and mitosis. In postmitotic cells, NEK1 is 
a primary regulator of the formation of nonmotile primary cilium14,15. Disruption in the 
structure or function of primary cilia has been linked to neurological defects such as brain 
dysgenesis, hydrocephalus and intellectual disability16,17, and abnormalities in cilia number, 
structure and microtubule state occur in fibroblasts derived from SRPS patients homozygous 
for NEK1 truncation variants13. In vitro disruption of the activity of other neuronally 
expressed NEK family members has similarly been shown to disrupt neuronal morphology, 
neurite outgrowth, microtubule stability and microtubule dynamics18,19. Microtubule 
integrity and kinesin and dynein intraflagellar transport are essential to maintain cilia 
structure and function. This is of particular relevance as disruption of the microtubule 
cytoskeleton has been associated to the development of ALS3, and mutations of the dynein 
subunit dynactin are associated with motor neuron degeneration20. Additionally, motor 
neurons derived from mice expressing human SOD1 G93A show a selective loss of cilia 
both in vitro and in vivo21. Besides its role in ciliogenesis, NEK1 is also known to regulate 
mitochondrial membrane permeability22 and DNA repair23. Both of these processes have 
been extensively investigated in relation to ALS, and have been postulated to explain the 
toxicity of ALS- associated mutations in SOD1 and FUS24,25. Mutations in DNA-repair 
genes cause several early-onset neurological phenotypes, and multiple lines of evidence 
suggest defective DNA repair may contribute to both late-onset neurodegeneration and brain 
aging in general26. For example, oxidative damage and DNA strand breaks have been 
observed to be elevated in ALS, Alzheimer’ s disease and Parkinson’ s disease cases
27, and a 
recent large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated DNA-repair genes as 
age-of-onset modifiers in Huntington’ s disease
28. The pathological importance of DNA 
damage in ALS, and whether modifier effects observed in Huntington’ s disease may 
generalize to repeat-expansion disorders such as C9orf72-associated ALS, constitute 
important questions to be addressed. Finally, through its coiled-coil domain, NEK1 has been 
shown to interact with multiple other proteins of potential importance, including the ALS-
associated proteins VAPB and ALS2 (ref. 7) and the axonal outgrowth regulator FEZ1 
(ref. 29).

 Exome sequencing
Exome sequencing of patients was performed as previously described3. Raw sequence data 
for controls was obtained from dbGaP. Sequence reads were aligned to human reference 
GRCh37 using Burrows–Wheeler aligner (BWA) and processed according to recommended 
best practices31. Variant detection and genotyping were performed using the GATK 
HaplotypeCaller. Variant quality control was performed using the GATK variant quality 
score recalibration method, with a VQSLOD cutoff of 2.27 (truth set sensitivity of 99%). A 
minimum variant quality by depth (QD) score of 2 was also imposed and all genotypes 
associated with genotype quality (GQ) < 20 were reset to missing. Variants were also 
excluded in the event of case or control call rates < 70% (post genotype QC). Exome 
sequencing data was not used to infer the presence or absence of indels due to the limited 
sensitivity and comparatively high false positive rates associated with available calling 
algorithms32.
Genome sequencing
Whole-genome sequencing of 2,387 SALS samples and 1,093 controls was performed with 
Illumina’ s FastTrack services using PCR free library preparation and paired-end (100 bp or 
150 bp) sequencing on the HiSeq 2500 or Hiseq X platform (Illumina) to yield 35× coverage 
at minimum. BWA was used to align sequencing reads to genome build hg19, and the Isaac 
variant caller was used to call single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions 
(indels)33. Both the aligned and unaligned reads were delivered in binary sequence 
alignment/map format (BAM) together with variant call format (VCF) files containing the 
SNVs and indels. gVCF files were generated per individual, and variants that failed the 
Isaac-based quality filter were excluded.
Exome chip
A total of 5,815 ALS patients and 4,614 healthy controls from the Netherlands, Belgium, 
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK were included. Genotyping was conducted using 
Illumina HumanExome-12v1 BeadChips in accordance with the manufacturer’ s 
recommendations. The GenTrain 2.0 clustering algorithm was used for genotype calling, as 
implemented in the Illumina GenomeStudio software package. Initial genotype calls were 
made based on the HumanExome clusterfile provided by Illumina. More accurate cluster 
boundaries were determined based on the actual study data, after the exclusion of samples 
with a GenCall quality score in the lower 10th percentile of the distribution across all 
variants genotyped (p10GC) < 0.38 or call rate < 0.99. Subsequently, the excluded samples 
were added back into the data set, and new genotypes calls were made using the previously 
obtained cluster boundaries.
Sample filtering
Samples from the FALS discovery and SALS replication cohorts were excluded from 
analysis in the event of failing to meet genotype call rate, heterozygosity, gender 
concordance, duplication, relatedness or population stratification filters as summarized in 
Supplementary Figures 1 and 7. All samples from the FALS cohort were required to exhibit 
filtered exome-wide call rates > 70%. For both the FALS and SALS cohorts, PLINK

 (v1.07)34 was used to define an LD-pruned (r2 < 0.5, window size = 50, step = 5) set of 
autosomal markers with MAF > 0.01 and P > 0.001 for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg 
equilibrium. These marker sets were then used to calculate inbreeding coefficients for use in 
heterozygosity filtering, identify study duplicates, conduct relatedness filtering, perform 
tests of pairwise population concordance for stratification filtering, conduct PCA for a 
second round of stratification filtering and conduct PCA to generate covariates for 
stratification correction in RVB analysis and single-variant analysis of filtered cohorts. 
Samples from the SALS replication cohort were required to exhibit no relatedness/
duplication with samples from the FALS discovery cohort. PLINK was used to calculate 
inbreeding coefficients, test for discordance in reported and SNV predicted gender and 
conduct tests of pairwise population concordance. Identification of sample duplicates and 
sample relatedness was performed using KING35. PCA was conducted using genome-wide 
complex trait analysis (GCTA)36. Details of results from population stratification analysis 
are provided in Supplementary Figures 2 and 8.
Statistical analyses
RVB analyses were performed by logistic regression of case–control status to number of 
minor alleles observed per sample per gene3,37. Results from underpowered tests (≤3 
observations in combined case–control cohort) were excluded and did not contribute to 
assessments of genomic inflation. Variants were included for RVB analyses on the basis of 
MAF within the combined case–control cohort, MAF within the 1000 Genomes project38, 
and pathogenicity predictions generated using snpEFF (single nucleotide polymorphism 
effect)39, PolyPhen2 (polymorphism phenotyping version 2)40, SIFT (sorting intolerant from 
tolerant)41, LRT (likelihood ratio test)42, MutationTaster43, MutationAssessor44, FATHMM 
(functional analysis through hidden Markov models)5, CADD (combined annotation 
dependent depletion)45, PROVEAN (protein variation effect analyzer)46, GERP (genomic 
evolutionary rate profiling)47, phyloP (phylogenetic P value)48, SiPhy (SiPhylogenic)49, 
dbNSFP (database nonsynonymous SNP functional prediction)50 and dbscSNV (database of 
splice site consequences of single nucleotide variants)4 as described in Supplementary Table 
1. All RVB analyses were conditioned for a missing variant MAF-weighted measure of 
sample gene call rate and the first four PCs derived from common variant profiles. 
Homozygosity mapping was performed using HomozygosityMapper51 allowing for genetic 
heterogeneity. ROH were selected as all loci achieving a homozygosity score ≥ 8,483 (0.6 × 
max). Single variant analyses were allele-count-based, conducted using PLINK, and also 
included correction for the first four PCs derived from common variant profiles. Meta-
analyses were conducted using METAL52 under a fixed-effect model with weighting by 
inverted effect size standard error. All statistical tests were two-sided.

RVB analysis of FALS exomes. (a) RVB analyses of 1,022 index FALS cases and 7,315 
controls for 10 known ALS genes, to assess 308 different combinations of MAF and 
functional prediction filters (Supplementary Table 1). The set of analysis parameters 
achieving the highest sensitivity for known ALS genes was identified as that achieving the 
highest area under the curve (AUC) in a plot of sensitivity (proportion of training genes 
achieving significance) across an increasing minimum P-value threshold. Dotted vertical line 
denotes Bonferroni-corrected P value for exome-wide significance. (b) Extension of the 
highest performing known gene-trained analysis to the entire exome. Threshold for exome-
wide significance is denoted by the dotted red line. �, observed genomic inflation factor. 
‘ Obs’  describes the 
P-value distribution for the observed data. ‘ Exp’  describes the 
P-value 
distribution under null expectation.

Replication analysis of NEK1 p.Arg261His. NEK1 p.Arg261His genotypes were ascertained 
for 1,022 FALS samples, 6,172 SALS samples and 11,732 controls. The SALS cohort was 
divided into seven geographically based case–control strata. Logistic regression was used to 
conduct tests of allelic association for all subcohorts and was followed by a fixed-effects 
meta-analysis. In the distribution of OR estimates across study cohorts (right), vertical 
dotted line denotes OR estimated under meta-analysis. CI, confidence interval.
