In Brief
Elicitation of broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bnAbs) is a critical HIV
vaccine goal. Steichen et al. have
developed immunogens that prime
germline-precursor B cells for the bnAb
PGT121 and can therefore initiate bnAb
induction. The authors have also
designed boosting immunogens to
shepherd the antibody maturation to
develop bnAbs.

SUMMARY
Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against
the N332 supersite of the HIV envelope (Env) trimer
are the most common bnAbs induced during infec-
tion, making them promising leads for vaccine
design. Wild-type Env glycoproteins lack detect-
able affinity for supersite-bnAb germline precur-
sors and are therefore unsuitable immunogens to
prime supersite-bnAb responses. We employed
mammalian cell surface display to design stabi-
lized Env trimers with affinity for germline-reverted
precursors of PGT121-class supersite bnAbs. The
trimers
maintained
native-like
antigenicity
and
structure, activated PGT121 inferred-germline B
cells ex vivo when multimerized on liposomes,
and primed PGT121-like responses in PGT121 in-
ferred-germline knockin mice. Design intermedi-
ates have levels of epitope modification between
wild-type and germline-targeting trimers; their mu-
tation gradient suggests sequential immunization
to induce bnAbs, in which the germline-targeting
prime is followed by progressively less-mutated
design intermediates and, lastly, with native tri-
mers. The vaccine design strategies described
could be utilized to target other epitopes on HIV
or other pathogens.
INTRODUCTION
A vaccine is needed for global HIV prevention. Broadly neutral-
izing antibodies (bnAbs) directed against relatively conserved
epitopes in the otherwise highly antigenically variable HIV enve-
lope (Env) glycoprotein trimer offer important guides for vaccine
design. BnAbs have been isolated from a small minority of HIV-
infected individuals and have been shown to protect against
challenge in various animal models, but have not been induced
by vaccination in humans or standard animal models (Burton
and Hangartner, 2016; Mascola and Haynes, 2013; West et al.,
2014). BnAbs recovered from natural infection are typically high-
ly mutated (Klein et al., 2013a; Mouquet et al., 2010; Pancera
et al., 2010; Scheid et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2011; Xiao et al.,
2009; Zhou et al., 2010) and many also contain insertions and/
or deletions (Kepler et al., 2014), owing to chronic stimulation
of B cells by mutating Env. Many bnAbs also possess unusually
long or short heavy-chain complementarity determining region 3
(CDR3) loops (Scheid et al., 2011; Walker et al., 2009, 2011; Wu
et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010) and some are polyreactive (Haynes
et al., 2005). Less mutated bnAbs with fewer unusual features
have been engineered, offering more tractable goals for consis-
tent vaccine elicitation (Georgiev et al., 2014; Jardine et al.,
2016b; Sok et al., 2013). Overall, bnAb elicitation by vaccination
presents a major challenge.
Recombinant native-like trimers are promising HIV vaccine
components because they contain the conformational epitopes
of most known bnAbs and lack many non-neutralizing epitopes
present on less native constructs (Julien et al., 2013; Kong

 et al., 2016; Kwon et al., 2015; Lyumkis et al., 2013; Pancera et al.,
2014; Sanders et al., 2013; Scharf et al., 2015). However, native-
like trimers have features that might impede bnAb induction; they
are highly glycosylated and expose both strain-specific neutral-
izing epitopes and non-neutralizing epitopes. Immunization with
native-like trimers in standard mouse, rabbit, and macaque
models has thus far elicited either non-neutralizing antibodies
(Hu et al., 2015) or neutralizing antibodies only against the immu-
nogen strain (de Taeye et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2015) analo-
gous to the strain-specific responses to the seasonal flu vaccine
in humans. Induction of HIV bnAbs will likely require development
of vaccination strategies that focus responses to relatively
conserved, sub-dominant epitopes and avoid or suppress re-
sponses to non-neutralizing and strain-specific epitopes.
Germline targeting, a vaccine priming strategy to initiate the
affinity maturation of specific germline-precursor B cells, could
help solve this immunofocusing problem by preferentially acti-
vating bnAb precursors (Dimitrov, 2010; Xiao et al., 2009). The
strategy aims to activate bnAb-precursor B cells, select produc-
tive (bnAb-like) somatic mutations, and produce memory B cells
that can be boosted subsequently to select additional produc-
tive mutations (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015). For
some bnAbs, inferred precursors have affinity for Env from
particular HIV isolates (Andrabi et al., 2015; Doria-Rose et al.,
2014; Gorman et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2013), facilitating design
of priming immunogens based on Env from those isolates (Hay-
nes et al., 2012). For other bnAbs, efforts to identify wild-type
(WT) Env that bind inferred precursors have failed (Hoot et al.,
2013; Jardine et al., 2013; McGuire et al., 2013; Scheid et al.,
2011; Xiao et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010). These latter
cases require design of modified Env to serve as a priming immu-
nogen (Dimitrov, 2010; Pancera et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2009;
Zhou et al., 2010). Proof of principle that designed germline-tar-
geting immunogens can activate their intended precursors and
generate a potentially boostable memory response was recently
demonstrated in knockin mice with B cell precursors for VRC01-
class bnAbs directed to the CD4-binding site (Dosenovic et al.,
2015; Jardine et al., 2015; McGuire et al., 2016). After a germ-
line-targeting prime, induction of bnAbs is expected to require
a succession of boosts, driving a succession of germinal-center
reactions, in order to select sufficient mutations (Dimitrov, 2010;
Dosenovic et al., 2015; Haynes et al., 2012; Jardine et al., 2013;
2015; 2016b; Klein et al., 2013b; Liao et al., 2013; McGuire et al.,
2013; 2016; Pancera et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011; Xiao et al.,
2009; Zhou et al., 2010). Supporting the concept that sequential
immunization with different immunogens will be required to
develop a bnAb response, native-like trimers but not germline-
targeting immunogens were found to boost near-bnAb B cells
(bearing a mature VRC01-class bnAb heavy chain) to induce
cross-neutralizing Abs (Dosenovic et al., 2015).
Glycan-dependent bnAbs in general, and N332-supersite
bnAbs in particular, are important targets for germline-targeting
vaccine design. In a recent longitudinal study of HIV infection in
Africa, more than half of the HIV-infected individuals who pro-
duced bnAb responses produced them against glycan-directed
epitopes, the majority of which were within the N332 supersite
(Landais et al., 2016). The prevalence of N332-supersite bnAb
responses is probably due in part to the high accessibility of their
epitopes on top of the trimer.
Among N332-supersite bnAbs, PGT121-class bnAbs have
been particularly well characterized, providing strong rationale
for germline-targeting efforts. PGT121-class bnAbs are among
the most potent bnAbs (Mouquet et al., 2012; Walker et al.,
2011), and PGT121 delivered passively to macaques protects
against SHIV (simian-human immunodeficiency virus) infection
(Moldt et al., 2012; Shingai et al., 2014) and can suppress viremia
when delivered after infection (Barouch et al., 2013; Shingai et al.,
2013). However, PGT121-class inferred precursors show no
measureable affinity for WT Env proteins that have been evalu-
ated (Mouquet et al., 2012; Sok et al., 2013). Thus, development
of a priming immunogen for PGT121-class precursors requires
either design of a modified Env or identification of a natural Env
with PGT121-class germline-binding capacity. Crystal structures
have been determined for several PGT121-class bnAbs in com-
plex with either BG505 SOSIP native-like trimers or gp120 (Gar-
ces et al., 2015; Garces et al., 2014; Julien et al., 2013; Kong
et al., 2016; Pancera et al., 2014) and for unliganded structures
of two germline-reverted PGT121 variants (Mouquet et al.,
2012; Sok et al., 2013), providing critical information to guide
design of modified Env for PGT121-class germline targeting.
PGT121-class bnAbs interact with conformationally flexible
structures on HIV Env, including several glycans and the
V1 variable loop, making computational design of germline-tar-
geting Env challenging. Here, we developed a structure-guided
directed evolution approach, by using mammalian cell surface
display, to design PGT121-class germline-targeting stabilized-
trimer immunogens. We multimerized these trimers on lipo-
somes and evaluated trimer and liposome immunogens via bio-
physical, structural, and ex vivo B cell activation analyses. We
further evaluated germline-targeting trimers by vaccination in
PGT121 inferred-germline knockin mice. Our design process
produced design intermediates with increasing levels of epitope
modification between WT and germline-targeting trimers. These
results led to our hypothesizing prime-boosting strategies in
which a germline-targeting prime is followed by boosts with pro-
gressively less modified design intermediates and then with WT
Env, followed ultimately by a cocktail of Env variants to expand
breadth. Evaluation of several of these prime-boosting strategies
in PGT121 germline and chimeric knockin mice is described in a
related study (Escolano et al., 2016).
RESULTS
Design of Germline-Targeting gp120s
We identified mammalian cell surface display as a desirable plat-
form for engineering modified HIV Env constructs with affinity for
inferred-germline PGT121 Abs because it should allow for optimi-
zation of monomeric or multimeric antigens bearing mammalian
glycans (Chen et al., 2008). Therefore, we developed a lenti-
virus-based mammalian-cell-surface-display method to carry
out directed evolution of HIV gp120 monomers and gp140 trimers
(Figure S1). Structural analysis of the PGT121 interaction with
gp120 (Julien et al., 2013; Pancera et al., 2014) led us to
hypothesize that the V1 and V3 loops were the key sites for germ-
line-targeting mutations. For selection agents, we assembled a
collection of six germline-reverted Abs, all using heavy-chain
genes VH4-59, D3-3, and J6 and light-chain genes V3-21 and
J3, with varying degrees of mutation in the D gene and L-CDR3
484

 and with differences in the non-templated regions at the V-D and
D-J boundaries (Figure S2). Ranked by similarity to the germline D
andL-CDR3sequences,theseAbsareGLCDR3rev1 (mostsimilarto
germline D and L-CDR3), GLCDR3rev2, GLCDR3rev3, GLCDR3rev4,
GLCDR3rev5, and GLCDR3mat (germline V and J genes but with
mature CDR3 loops). We began by screening libraries based on
the template genes BG505 T332N gp120 and BG505 SOSIP
T332Ngp140(Sanderset al., 2013),inwhich theconserved glyco-
sylation site at position 332 absent in BG505 was introduced
(Figure 1A). These molecules had no detectable affinity for germ-
line-revertedPGT121Abs(Figure 1B andTable S1). Therefore,we
employed a ‘‘bootstrapping’’ approach: for initial screening we
utilized two variants of GLCDR3mat, one with nine PGT121 light-
chain mutations (GL+9, with 28 mM affinity for BG505 T332N
gp120) and another with three light-chain mutations (GL+3, no
detectable affinity
for BG505
T332N gp120) (Figure S2).
Screening a gp120 random mutagenesis library for binding to
GL+9 led to the molecule 3MUT, with mutations T135A and
T139I, which eliminate the V1 loop glycosylation sites at positions
133 and 137 (Figure 1A). Screening a gp140 structure-guided V1
loop library for binding to GL+3 led to the isolation of 5MUT, with
four different mutations (V134Y, N136P, I138L, and D140N) in the
V1 loop. Combining the mutations in 3MUT and 5MUT produced
7MUT gp120, our first construct with quantifiable affinity for
GLCDR3mat (KD = 44 mM, Figures 1A and 1B). To improve this affin-
ityfurther, we screened a gp120 V1-andV3-loop saturationmuta-
genesis library for binding to GLCDR3mat; combining the most
enriched mutations (N137F, T320F, and Q328M) with 7MUT

 produced 10MUT, with KD z1 mM for GLCDR3mat (Figures 1A and
1B). Finally, to increase affinity and breadth, we screened a gp120
V1 loopdirected mutagenesislibrary forbinding to GLCDR3rev2 and
GLCDR3rev4(FigureS2).Thisapproachculminatedin11MUTB,with
KDs of �5 mM, �3 mM, and �8 mM for GLCDR3rev1, GLCDR3rev3, and
GLCDR3rev5, respectively, and detectable but not quantifiable
binding to GLCDR3rev4 (Figure 1A, Figure S3, and Table S1).
Thus, mammalian display-directed evolution enabled the design
of germline-targeting gp120 molecules with appreciable affinity
for PGT121 germline-reverted antibodies.
Design of Stabilized and Germline-Targeting Trimers
For initial design of germline-targeting and boosting trimers, we
transferred the germline-targeting mutations from the gp120 ver-
sions of 3MUT, 5MUT, 7MUT and 10MUT onto the BG505 SOSIP
trimer platform. These molecules displayed characteristics of
native-like trimers, such as high affinity for the trimer-specific
bnAb PGT151 (Falkowska et al., 2014) and a melting tempera-
ture (Tm) similar to that of BG505 SOSIP (Figure 2A). Further-
more, all had similar monovalent affinities for PGT121 and
GLCDR3mat as their gp120 counterparts (Figure 2A), indicating
that the germline-targeting mutations were transferable to a
native-like trimer.
In addition to binding bnAb putative precursors, germline-tar-
geting trimers should have an otherwise native-like antigenic
profile, with high affinity for bnAbs and no significant affinity for
non-neutralizing antibodies directed to epitopes exposed on
monomeric gp120 but buried or conformationally absent on
the trimer. BG505 SOSIP gp140, the trimer on which our
PGT121-class germline-targeting designs were based, displays
undesirable binding to V3 non-neutralizing antibodies (Sanders
et al., 2013) (Figure 2B and Figure S4) and induces non-neutral-
izing V3 responses in mice, rabbits, and macaques (de Taeye
et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2015), indicating
that this trimer samples conformational states that expose
non-neutralizing epitopes. Furthermore, BG505 SOSIP gp140
displayed on mammalian cells via a PDGFR linker showed strong
binding to trimer-structure-dependent bnAbs (PGT151 and
PGT145) (Falkowska et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2011) but also
to non-neutralizing antibodies directed to the V3 loop (4025)
(Gorny et al., 2011) and the CD4-binding site (b6) (Barbas
et al., 1992) (not shown), suggesting the coexistence on
the cell surface of native-like trimers along with non-native tri-
mers, dimers, and/or monomers. We also found that adding
germline-targeting mutations to BG505 SOSIP reduced the
already modest expression by 50% (Figure 2A). Therefore, we
sought to use mammalian-display directed evolution to improve
the antigenic profile, thermal stability, and expression of the
BG505 SOSIP trimer and germline-targeting trimers.
Our trimer improvement effort focused on two types of libraries:
(1) whole-gene saturation mutagenesis libraries and (2) a combi-
natorial library sampling the one or two most common HIV resi-
dues at Env positions where BG505 uses rare (frequency <
10%) HIV residues (Figure 2C). The rare library, which allowed
variation at eleven positions in gp120 and two in gp41,
was screened for binding to trimer-structure-preferring bnAbs
PGT145, PGT151, and PG16 and for lack of binding to non-
neutralizing antibodies b6 and 4025. This produced the Rare3
clone with five mutations in gp120 (T106E, M271I, F288L,
T290A,N363Q)andwiththe expressionyield improved by a factor
of �2 and the Tm increased by 1.4�C (Figure S5). The saturation
mutagenesis library was constructed in three segments, two
covering gp120 and one for gp41 (Figure 2C). Next-generation
sequencing and bioinformatics were employed to analyze the re-
sults of the first two sorts (Jardine et al., 2016a), and Sanger
sequencing was used to identify enriched clones that survived
four or five sorts. Enriched mutations from both sequencing
methods were combined and tested in soluble trimers and were
also assembled into combinatorial libraries and re-screened
with the same antibodies as before. The gp41 library produced
MD2, with an L568D point mutation that increased expression
levels by a factor of �4, and MD33, with four additional mutations
(F519S, A561P, V570H, and R585H) that increased the Tm by 4�C
and improved expression by a factor of �7, relative to BG505
SOSIP (Figure S5). The gp120 library produced MD16, with three
mutations (F223W, R304V, and A319Y) andreducedbinding to V3
non-neutralizing antibodies (Figure S4). Finally, mutations from
Rare3, MD16, and MD33 were combined to produce MD39 with
11 mutations (F223W and T290A did not improve the biophysical
properties of the trimer and were excluded; data not shown).
Compared to BG505 SOSIP.D664, the MD39 yield improved by
a factor of �7, Tm increased by 10�C, and antigenic profile
improved, with reduced V3 Ab reactivity and similar bnAb binding
exceptforslightlyreduced affinitiesforV2apexbnAbs(Figures2A
and 2B and Figure S5)
Combining the MD39 mutations with germline-targeting muta-
tions produced germline-targeting trimers with improved prop-
erties. MD39-10MUT had a 6-fold-improved yield and 6�C higher
Tm as compared to 10MUT (Figure 2A and Figure S5). Our most
advanced germline-targeting trimer, MD39-11MUTB, the only
trimer with detectable affinity for five of six PGT121 germline re-
verted variants tested (Figure 2B), had excellent yield, thermal
stability, and antigenic profile (Figures 2A and 2B). Directed evo-
lution therefore produced native-like trimers with improved po-
tential functionality via both stabilization and germline-targeting
mutations.
Structural Analysis
To ascertain whether stabilized, PGT121 germline-targeting tri-
mers maintain native-like structure, we conducted crystallog-
raphy and electron microscopy (EM) studies. Negative-stain
EM two-dimensional (2D) classification revealed that all four
trimers tested (MD39, 10MUT, MD39-10MUT, and MD39-
11MUTB) were characterized by a high fraction (R95%) of
native-like structural features and were similar in appearance
to BG505 SOSIP (Figure 3A). The MD39 mutations improved
the structural uniformity of the 10MUT trimer; the amount of
flexible, native open conformations dropped from 35% to 5%
between 10MUT and MD39-10MUT (see the Experimental
Procedures for a description of the 2D classification system).
Our best germline-targeting trimer, MD39-11MUTB, exhibited
100% native closed conformations and was indistinguishable
from BG505 SOSIP by EM. For higher resolution analysis, we
solved a 4.5 A
˚ resolution crystal structure of MD39-10MUTA, a
variant of MD39-10MUT with one mutation added and another
removed (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), com-
plexed with 35O22 and PGT124 (Garces et al., 2014; Sok
et al., 2013). Although this resolution precluded analyses of
486
Immunity 45, 483–496, September 20, 2016
 side-chain conformations, and the interface between trimer and
PGT124 could not be analyzed due to missing V1 loop density,
the structure accurately determined the backbone positions for
most (1,659 of 1,692) residues of gp140. Superposition of the
gp140 backbones in this structure and in the 3.0 A
˚ structure of
BG505 SOSIP N137A complexed with 3H109L and 35O22
(PDB: 5CEZ) or the 3.1 A
˚ structure of BG505 SOSIP bound to
PGT122 and 35O22 (PDB: 4TVP) gives backbone root-mean-
square deviation values of 0.7 and 1.1 A
˚ , respectively (Figure 3B).
We conclude that MD39-10MUTA, with 20 mutations relative to
BG505 SOSIP T332N (Figure 3C), retains an overall native-like
conformation.

Figure 2. Design of Mutations to Stabilize BG505-SOSIP and Germline-Targeting Native-Like Trimers
(A) Biophysical properties of stabilized BG505-SOSIP and germline-targeting trimers. Antigenic profile was assessed by SPR, thermostability measurements
were made by DSC, and expression was determined as yield of purified protein relative to BG505-SOSIP made with PEI or 293Fectin transfection reagents in
293F cells. Monovalent KDs were measured by SPR with trimer ligand and Fab analyte except for PGT145 and PGDM1400, for which monovalent KDs were
determined with IgG ligand and trimer analyte. For PGT151, a one-to-one binding model gave a relatively poor kinetic fit.

 Liposome Platform
We have previously found that highly multimeric particulate
immunogens are superior to trimeric immunogens for B cell acti-
vation ex vivo (Jardine et al., 2013) and for generation of antigen-
specific memory B cells after immunization in vivo (Jardine et al.,
2015). Therefore, we developed trimer-conjugated liposomes to
improve the immunogenic potential of our germline-targeting tri-
mers. Trimers with a C-terminal His-tag were attached to 145-nm
mean diameter uni-lamellar liposomes (DSPC [1,2-distearoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine], 66.5%; cholesterol, 28.5%; DGS-
NTA(Ni), 5%) via the histidine-Ni-NTA interaction. On average,
522 ± 92 trimers were attached to each liposome. Cryo-EM ex-
amination of trimer-decorated liposomes confirmed the dense
particulate array of trimers (Figure 4A). ELISA analysis on intact
vesicles indicated that trimer-decorated liposomes maintained
the native-like antigenic profile and germline-binding properties
of the soluble trimers (Figure 4B).
Ex Vivo B Cell Activation
To determine whether germline-targeting trimers or trimer lipo-
somes can specifically activate germline or mature PGT121 B
cells, we conducted ex vivo experiments with B cells harvested
from PGT121 GLCDR3rev4 knockin mice, PGT121 bnAb knockin
mice, and wild-type (WT) mice (Escolano et al., 2016) (PGT121
GLCDR3rev4 is referred to as GLHL121 in Escolano et al.). B cell
activation was measured by a Ca2+-flux assay (Ota et al., 2012)
for MD39, 10MUT, and MD39-11MUTB (as trimers and trimer li-
posomes) and was compared to positive control activators (ion-
omycin and IgM) and negative control activators (ovalbumin)
(Figure 5). Soluble trimers did not specifically activate germline
PGT121 B cells (Figure S6) but did activate PGT121 bnAb B cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S6), with the strongest acti-
vation by MD39-11MUTB, in accordance with its higher affinity
for PGT121 as compared to MD39 and 10MUT (Figure 2C).
MD39-11MUTB liposomes activated PGT121 germline B cells
at concentrations as low as 0.3 mg/mL, whereas MD39 or
10MUT liposomes failed to activate at concentrations up to
300 mg/mL (Figure 5 and Figure S6). We conclude that MD39-
11MUTB liposomes have promise as a PGT121-class germline-
targeting prime.
Priming Germline PGT121 Responses in Knockin Mice
To determine whether germline-targeting trimers can activate
germline PGT121 B cells in vivo, we conducted priming immuni-
zations in PGT121-GLCDR3rev4 knockin mice (Escolano et al.,
2016). A combined five mice were immunized with 10MUT
SOSIP, in two separate experiments, and four mice were immu-
nized with MD39-11MUTB SOSIP. In a control experiment, six

 mice were immunized with BG505 SOSIP. Two weeks after a sin-
gle immunization, the sera was analyzed for immunogen- and
epitope-specific responses. Sera of BG505-SOSIP-immunized
mice showed no detectable binding to the BG505 SOSIP immu-
nogen (Figure 6). In contrast, 4/5 10MUT-immunized mice and
4/4 11MUTB-immunized mice showed epitope-specific serum
responses to either 10MUT-gp120 or MD39-11MUTB SOSIP
(Figure 6). We conclude that germline-targeting mutations,
such as those in 10MUT and 11MUTB, are required for activation
of inferred PGT121 germline B cells in vivo by BG505-based
native-like trimers.
Sequential Boosting Strategies
As noted above, induction of bnAbs after a germline-targeting
prime is expected to require sequential boosting with epitope
variants to mature the response. With PGT121-class germline-
targeting candidates (10MUT and 11MUTB) in hand, we devel-
oped boosting strategies aiming to select PGT121-like muta-
tions and induce bnAbs. We hypothesized that any sequential
immunization strategy starting with a germline-targeting trimer
should end with a native-like trimer, such as BG505 MD39
SOSIP, so as to select mutations productive for high-affinity
interaction with native trimers present on circulating HIV strains.
However, in order for PGT121-class antibodies to engage their
epitope including the N137 glycan on the V1 loop, such anti-
bodies must accommodate V1 loops diverse not only in
sequence but also in length and number of glycosylation sites
(Figures 7A–7C), implying that boosting with a single native-like
trimer bearing a single V1 loop might not be sufficient. Indeed,
boosting only with a BG505 native-like trimer would present a
V1 loop that is significantly shorter than most (Figure 7B).
Furthermore, modeling of variable loops and glycan conforma-
tions (not shown) suggested that diversity in the V2 and V4 loops
might potentially impact the PGT121 epitope by altering confor-
mational sampling of the V1 loop or N332 glycan, respectively
(Figures 7A–7C), and immunodominant responses involving V2
or V4 could potentially sterically interfere with PGT121-class
boosting. On the basis of these considerations, we hypothesized
that a cocktail of native-like trimers displaying diverse variants of
the V1, V2, and V4 loops, especially variants within hotspots of
more frequently occurring combinations of length and number
of glycosylation sites (Figure 7B), might be needed to select
PGT121-class mutations favoring neutralization breadth. We
therefore designed and produced four native-like trimers based
on BG505 MD39 SOSIP and containing diverse loops for V1, V2,
V4, and V5 (Figure 7C, Figures S7A and S7B, and Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). These trimers, together with BG505
MD39 SOSIP, form a five-member variable loop cocktail (VLC)
that might broaden PGT121-like responses initiated by a germ-
line-targeting trimer (Figure 7D).
We then considered the question of what intermediate boosts,
if any, might be employed between a germline-targeting prime
and a native-like trimer. Our germline-targeting design interme-
diates become increasingly more native-like in the PGT121
epitope (e.g., 7MUT, 5MUT, and 3MUT have six, four, and two
epitope mutations, respectively), but the 5MUT and 3MUT muta-
tions are mutually exclusive (3MUT lacks two V1 glycans while
5MUT has those glycans but has four other V1 loop mutations)
(Figure 1A). These considerations impose directionality on any
boosting scheme (e.g., 7MUT should not be used after 5MUT
or 3MUT or WT and 3MUT should not be used after 5MUT),
thus limiting the number of possible schemes (Table S3). Consid-
ering only the most efficient directional schemes, those employ-
ing boosting pairs that differ by more than one mutation or
involve substantial affinity changes (Table S4), we identified a
total of seven potential boosting schemes (Figures 7E).
We sought to rank these schemes to allow prioritization for
experimental testing. We reasoned that the least mutated anti-
body that shows measurable affinity for all of the potential boost-
ing immunogens, GL+9, could serve as a proxy for intermediate
PGT121-class antibodies developing after a germline-targeting
prime and before a native-like boost. We further reasoned that
the affinity drop, the ratio of GL+9 affinities for two immunogens,
could be used to estimate the likelihood of successfully boosting
memory B cells when the two immunogens are used in sequence
(e.g., the GL+9 KDs for 7MUT and 3MUT are 3 nM and 1,600 nM
respectively, so when immunizing with 7MUT followed by 3MUT,
the affinity drop would be 1,600/3 = 530). One expects that a
boost immunogen with very different epitope structure from
the previous immunogen might result in too large an affinity

 drop to activate memory B cells generated by the prior immu-
nogen. We estimated the affinity drops for all seven boosting
schemes (Figure 7E), ranked them according to the largest affin-
ity drop in that boosting scheme, and listed the three most likely
to succeed (Figure 7F).
In collaborating work, Escolano et al. (2016) evaluated boosting
schemes following the 10MUT trimer prime in PGT121 germline
(GLCDR3-rev4) knockin mice and PGT121 mature-heavy-and-
germline-light-chain knockin mice. Relying on the directionality
of the boosting immunogens developed here, Escolano et al.
used serum ELISA against boost candidates after each immuni-
zation to select the most native-like directional boost for which at
least weak serum reactivity could be detected; that process re-
sulted in the testing of the second scheme in Figure 7F and the
finding that this scheme induces PGT121-like bnAbs with sub-
stantial breadth and potency. Although the first scheme in Fig-
ure 7F remains to be tested, the data in Escolano et al. support
the validity of the logic underlying these boosting schemes.
We note that the affinity drop analysis also provides clues as
to how to improve boosting schemes: to minimize the probability
of a boost failure at a high affinity drop, one could redesign im-
munogens to equalize the affinity drops in any given scheme.
Thus the germline-targeting design process is capable of
defining potential boost immunogens and directional boosting
schemes, and it can guide prioritization and improvement of
such schemes.
DISCUSSION
Germline-targeting vaccine design offers the potential to initiate
the induction of specific classes of protective antibodies against
HIV or other pathogens that have eluded vaccine development.
Many protective bnAbs against HIV are directed toward
glycan-dependent epitopes on the trimeric glycoprotein spike
(Burton and Hangartner, 2016; Mascola and Haynes, 2013;
West et al., 2014). Therefore, methods are needed to develop
trimer immunogens for germline targeting and boosting of
glycan-dependent bnAbs. Trimer immunogens should be stabi-
lized, to maximize the probability of retaining native-like confor-
mational epitopes in vivo and to minimize the probability of elic-
iting non-neutralizing Abs that could potentially detract from
priming or boosting the targeted bnAb responses.
Here, we (1) developed a mammalian-cell-surface-display
directed-evolution method for optimization of multimeric anti-
gens bearing human glycans; (2) engineered stabilized HIV Env
trimers with affinity for both germline and mature PGT121-class
glycan-dependent bnAbs; (3) showed by crystallography and
EM that these trimers maintain native-like conformations; (4)
demonstrated that germline-targeting trimers multimerized on
liposomes potently activate PGT121 germline and mature B
cells ex vivo; and (5) showed that soluble germline-targeting tri-
mers can prime PGT121-class responses in vivo, in a PGT121 in-
ferred-germline knockin mouse. Our data indicate that 11MUTB

 trimers and trimer-liposomes are promising candidates for
priming PGT121-class glycan-dependent bnAb responses in im-
mune systems with diverse antibody repertoires, although the
frequency of PGT121-class precursors in humans and the germ-
line-targeting affinities and/or avidities necessary to prime those
precursors remain to be determined.
This work could provide a more general template for HIV bnAb
germline-targeting than previous work on germline-targeting for
VRC01-class bnAbs directed to the CD4-binding site. VRC01-
class bnAbs generally do not depend on glycans for their activity,
evidenced by the fact that elimination of glycans surrounding the
VRC01epitopegenerallyincreasesneutralizationpotency(Jardine
et al., 2016b); this has led to removal of all epitope-proximal native
glycans from germline-targeting candidates (Jardine et al., 2013,
2015, 2016a; McGuire et al., 2013, 2014, 2016). However, the ac-
tivity of many HIV bnAbs requires engagement of one or more gly-
cans within their epitope, and germline-targeting primes should
probably retain such key glycans, as was the case here with the
N332, N301, and N156 glycans. Furthermore, owing to the relative
inaccessibility of the VRC01 epitope on native-like trimers, efforts
todesign VRC01-class germline-targetingprimes have converged
on strategies to increase epitope exposure by presentation on
minimal domains rather than on trimers (Jardine et al., 2013,
2015, 2016a; McGuire et al., 2013, 2016), although boosting with
native-like trimers is anticipated to be required to mature the
response (Jardine et al., 2016b). In contrast, many bnAb proteo-
glycan epitopes are well exposed on native-like trimers, and
some are formed only on intact trimers, making native-like trimers
like those designed here the preferred platform for germlinetarget-
ing. Indeed, multiple different bnAbs could potentially be primed
witha singletrimerharboring multiple germline-targetingepitopes.
Because germline-targeting vaccine design requires devel-
oping not only the vaccine prime but also boost immunogens to
mature the response in order to elicit bnAbs, we developed both
a stabilized native-like trimer (MD39) and a cocktail of native-like
trimers (VLC) that could be employed as boosts to potentially
refine and expand the breadth of responses initiated by a germ-
line-targeting prime. However, considering that memory B cells
induced by the germline-targeting prime might not be sufficiently
mutatedtobe boostedbya native-liketrimer,intermediateboosts
might be needed to mature the response prior to native-like
boosts. In the process of developing PGT121-class germline-tar-
geting immunogens, we created design intermediates with
increasing levels of epitope modification between wild-type and
germline-targeting trimers. These molecules are candidate boost
immunogens that, if used in sequence, offer directional and
gradual epitope changes to guide maturation of the B cell
response. We proposed seven potential sequential immunization
schemes, and our analysis of affinity drops provided a ranking of
those schemes. In a related paper (Escolano et al., 2016), a subset
of these prime-boosting schemes were evaluated in PGT121
germline knockin mice and PGT121 mature-heavy-and-germ-
line-light-chain knockin mice, and one such scheme was found
tobe effectiveforinducing bnAbsinbothmouse models,support-
ing thegermline-targeting vaccine design process described here
and encouraging its expanded use and further improvement.
Although here we have described strategies for designing
trimer immunogens with changes in the structure of an epitope
in order to prime and mature an epitope-specific response, the
ultimate success of these strategies might also require modifica-
tion of antigenic surfaces outside the epitope of interest, to mini-
mize boosting of off-target responses that might hinder or
interfere with the desired epitope-specific response.
The approaches employed here could be adapted for
immunogen design to other bnAb targets on HIV and other path-
ogens. The ‘‘bootstrapping’’ strategy of using partially mutated

 antibodies (such as GL+3 and GL+9) as initial selection agents
and then using antibodies closer to germline in successive
iterations could be useful for design of germline-targeting and
boosting immunogens for other bnAbs, such as HIV V2 Apex
glycan-dependent bnAbs (Andrabi et al., 2015; Gorman et al.,
2016) or influenza virus hemagglutinin stem-directed bnAbs.
Our mammalian display methods allowing directed evolution
on native-like trimers should be useful in those endeavors and
could also be used to stabilize monomeric or multimeric glyco-
protein immunogens for diverse viral vaccines.
In summary, we have developed stabilized native-like trimer
immunogens for germline-targeting and boosting of glycan-
dependent PGT121-class bnAb responses against HIV. The
immunogens and boosting schemes we created are candidates
for human vaccine testing and further optimization, and the
methods developed here are applicable to immunogen design
for other epitopes and pathogens and thus are of relevance for
future vaccine design.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
DNA Gene Synthesis and Protein Production
Genes were synthesized by GenScript. gp120s, gp140s, antigen binding frag-
ments (Fabs), and IgGs were expressed in 293 cells and purified as described
in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Library Assembly
The BG505 SOSIP whole-gene saturation mutagenesis and ‘‘rare’’ amino acid
libraries were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and GenScript,
respectively. Libraries for germline targeting were created by error-prone
PCR (GeneMorph II, Agilent), site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Agilent)
or two-step assembly PCR of degenerate primers with the Q5 High-Fidelity
DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified version
of the gateway cloning entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO (Ota et al., 2012) with
the circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC) method (Quan and Tian,
2014) or Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs), according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. All libraries were then transferred to the lentiviral vector
pLenti CMVTRE3G puro Dest (Ota et al., 2012) with the LR Clonase II enzyme
mix (Thermo Scientific).
Lentivirus Production and Stable Cell Generation
293T cells cultured in Advanced DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 5% fetal
calf serum, GlutaMAX (GIBCO), 2-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO), and Antibiotic-
Antimycotic (GIBCO) were co-transfected with 10.8 mg pLenti CMVTRE3G
puro Dest gene library, 7.0 mg psPAX2, and 3.8 mg pMD2.G, as previously
described (Salmon and Trono, 2007). 293T cells stably expressing rtTA3G
from the pLenti CMV rtTA3G Blast vector (Ota et al., 2012) were transduced
at low MOI (< 0.1) in a T75 or T225 flask in the presence of 10 mg/mL blasticidin
and, after 24 hr, were transferred to medium supplemented with 2 mg/mL
puromycin.
Cell Surface Expression and FACS
293T cells containing the stable library were induced with doxycycline
(1 mg/mL) and harvested the next day in fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) buffer (HBSS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA). Cells containing BG505-SO-
SIP libraries were transfected with furin 24 hr prior to induction. Cells were
stained with IgGs or Fabs for �30 min, washed with FACS buffer, and then
stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled a-cMyc (Immunology
Consultants Laboratory). IgGs were labeled with phycoerythrin (PE)-conju-
gated a-human IgG (Sigma), Fabs containing HA epitope tags (PGT145,
PGT151, and PG16) were labeled with a-HA-PE (Miltenyi Biotec), and
Fabs containing V5 epitope tags (B6 and 4025) were labeled with a-V5-
FITC (GeneTex). Cells were sorted on a BD Influx (BD Biosciences) FACS
sorter. Approximately 2 3 105 double positive cells were collected and
expanded for approximately one week in the presence of puromycin and
blasticidin before the next round of enrichment. Once the desired popula-
tion had been obtained, chromosomal DNA was extracted from the cell cul-
ture with the GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma). The
gp120 or gp140 gene was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA and in-
serted back into the pENTR vector via CPEC cloning or Gibson Assembly
and transformed into TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen); colonies were
sequenced at Genewiz.
Next-Generation Sequencing
Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the BG505-SOSIP whole-gene satu-
ration mutagenesis libraries were done essentially as described previously
(Jardine et al., 2016a).
Trimer-Conjugated Liposome Synthesis and Characterization
Unilamellar liposomes comprised of DSPC:cholesterol:DGS-NTA(Ni) lipids
in a 66.5:28.5:5 mole ratio were synthesized by lipid film rehydration and
membrane extrusion, followed by post-synthesis binding of 6xHis-tagged
trimer for 2 hr at 4�C. Unconjugated trimer was removed by size exclusion
chromatography. Total conjugated trimer was quantified by ELISA in the
presence of 1% triton-X and 100 mM imidazole to fully disrupt liposomes
and Ni-6xHis interactions, respectively, for uninhibited detection via an
a-6xHis antibody. Antigenic profiles were determined by ELISA on intact
liposomes.
Ca2+-Flux Measurements and Immunizations
Details about Ca2+-flux assays and mouse immunizations can be found in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures and in Escolano et al., 2016.
Negative-Stain EM
Purified SOSIP trimers were analyzed by negative-stain EM with a protocol
adapted from de Taeye et al., 2016.
Figure 7. Sequential Boosting Schemes Employing a Native-Like Trimer Cocktail and Germline-Targeting Design Intermediates
(A) Side view of a single PGT122 Fab (light blue cartoon and semi-transparent surface) bound to the BG505 SOSIP native-like gp140 trimer, based on PDB: 4NCO.
The PGT122-bound gp140 subunit is shown in wheat-colored cartoon; the V1, V2, V4, and V5 variable loops on that subunit, modeled wherever missing in the
crystal structure, are shown in yellow (V1), olive (V2), teal (V4), and magenta (V5); the N332 glycan is shown as red spheres; and the two other gp140 subunits are
shown as gray surfaces.
(B) Same model as in (A), except that glycosylation sites on the trimer have been decorated with Man8GlcNAc2 glycans shown as spheres (V1 glycans, red; V2
glycans, olive; V4 glycans, teal; N156 glycan, magenta; N332 glycan, red; all other glycans, gray), and all trimer subunits are shown as gray surfaces.
(C) 2D histogram of variable loop (V1, V2, V4, and V5) length and number of glycosylation sites among 3,897 unique HIV Env sequences isolated from infected
individuals and obtained from http://www.hiv.lanl.govcontent/index. Frequency is indicated by the color scale shown for each loop. The length and number of
glycosylation sites for each loop of the native-like VLC trimers are indicated. Further elaboration of this cocktail could include accounting for sequence variation at
non-variable-loop positions within the N332-epitope region (Figure S7C).
(D) Basic scheme in which a germline-targeting prime (10MUT or 11MUTB) is boosted by a native-like trimer (BG505) and then by a cocktail of native-like trimers.
(E) Diagram illustrating seven boosting schemes employing germline-targeting design intermediates (7MUT, 6MUT, 5MUT, and 3MUT) as boosts after a germline-
targeting prime and before a native-like trimer; the scheme in (A) is included for reference. Relative affinity drops (in fold affinity decrease) for each boost,
computed from Figure 1B as described in the text, are indicated as red numbers.
(F) Linear diagrams of three of the best boosting schemes as ranked by favoring those with the smallest maximum affinity drop.
