ABSTRACT
Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have 
enabled detection of biomarkers in cell-free DNA in blood and may ultimately replace 
invasive tissue biopsies. However, a better understanding of the performance of 
blood-based NGS assays is needed prior to routine clinical use. As part of an IRB-
approved molecular profiling registry trial of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDA) patients, we facilitated blood-based NGS testing of 34 patients from multiple 
community-based and high-volume academic oncology practices. 23 of these patients 
also underwent traditional tumor tissue-based NGS testing. cfDNA was not detected 
in 9/34 (26%) patients. Overall concordance between blood and tumor tissue NGS 
assays was low, with only 25% sensitivity of blood-based NGS for tumor tissue NGS. 
Mutations in KRAS, the major PDA oncogene, were only detected in 10/34 (29%) 
blood samples, compared to 20/23 (87%) tumor tissue biopsies. The presence of 
mutations in circulating DNA was associated with reduced overall survival (54% in 
mutation-positive versus 90% in mutation-negative). Our results suggest that in the 
setting of previously treated, advanced PDA, liquid biopsies are not yet an adequate 
substitute for tissue biopsies. Further refinement in defining the optimal patient 
population and timing of blood sampling may improve the value of a blood-based test.
INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an 
aggressive cancer that is projected to become the second 
leading cause of cancer-related death by 2025 [1]. This 
is, in part, due to poor early detection strategies: most 
cases are detected at an advanced stage [2] despite the 
long amount of time required for metastatic disease 
                                                               Research Paper

to develop [3]. However, even resectable pancreatic 
cancers usually recur [2]. The current standard of care 
therapies for metastatic disease are comprised of cytotoxic 
chemotherapies, but despite recent improvements, the 
median overall survival remains less than one year [4, 
5]. In theory, personalized therapy for PDA promises a 
more rational approach than “standard of care” treatment, 
by identifying and targeting “actionable” or “driver” 
mutations. 
With the advent of new commercially available 
CLIA/CAP accredited lab testing for next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) panels, detection of actionable 
mutations from tissue biopsies no longer requires that 
the patient be seen at a specialized high-volume tertiary 
care academic medical center. Still, potential obstacles 
in detecting mutations from patient samples include the 
tumor not being accessible via biopsy and/or not enough 
tumor cells being extracted for DNA analysis. A potential 
solution for these problems is the development of “liquid 
biopsy” techniques that use the same NGS technologies 
for molecular profiling. Detection of circulating tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) in cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating 
tumor cells (ctcDNA), and tumor exosome-containing 
genomic material has created the possibility of a non-
invasive method for diagnosing and monitoring cancer [6]. 
We previously launched an initiative (Know 
Your Tumor, a collaboration between Perthera and the 
Pancreatic Cancer Action Network), which includes 
multi-omic molecular profiling of PDA patients’ tumors 
and matches patients with appropriate clinical trials 
and therapies based on actionable molecular anomalies, 
treatment history and geographical locations. However, 
to effectively implement this precision medicine strategy, 
biopsy samples with relatively high levels of tumor cells 
are needed, forcing us to exclude PDA patients with 
locally advanced disease, or those with small volume, 
non-biopsiable disease. As a promising solution, we 
evaluated two CLIA/CAP accredited blood-based NGS 
assays as a potential substitute for gold standard tissue 
biopsy procedures. Here we describe our experience with 
a pilot study of 34 PDA patients that represent a “real 
world” setting of consecutive patients with metastatic, 
disseminated disease in community and academic settings 
from locations across the United States. 
RESULTS
Feasibility of performing blood-based NGS assays 
from PDA patients regardless of the clinical 
setting
To evaluate the feasibility of incorporating 
circulating DNA-based NGS assays into a precision 
medicine strategy for pancreatic cancer, blood-based 
NGS assays were performed on 34 patients. Blood draws 
were sent to commercial laboratories for NGS analysis 
by the Guardant Health Guardant360 test (n = 26) or the 
Cynvenio ClearID test (n = 8). Hereafter, these assays 
will be referred to as the cfDNA-based NGS assay 
and the ctcDNA-based NGS assay, respectively. The 
majority of patients had extensive disease burden that 
had metastasized to the liver, lung, or peritoneal cavity. 
However, several patients had either localized disease 
or no detectable disease due to distal pancreatectomy or 
Whipple procedure (Table 1 and Table S1). In 57% of 
cases (13/23), blood samples were collected within six 
weeks of the tumor biopsy, and, importantly in 74% of 
cases (17/23), blood samples were collected while the 
patient’s clinical condition (extent of disease, and response 
to therapy) had not changed since the tumor biopsies 
(Table S1). 
Concordance between blood-based and tumor 
tissue biopsies
In the 19 patients with detectable tumor mutations in 
cfDNA, mutations were found in a median of 2 genes per 
patient (Figure 1 and Table S2). This number was lower 
than tumor tissue biopsies, in which a median of 13 genes 
per patient had mutations. A probable reason for the lower 
number of mutations in the cfDNA-based assay is that the 
panel had 68 genes while the panel used for tumor tissue 
NGS had 321 genes. After normalizing by the number 
of genes on each panel, the median frequency of altered 
genes per panel was similar (2.9% for the cfDNA-based 
NGS assay and 4.0% for the tissue-based NGS assay). 
However, in general there was no correlation between 
the number of mutations found in cfDNA and in tumor 
tissue (Figure 1A). We therefore focused on analyzing 
concordance in overlapping genes.
Detection of KRAS mutations by blood-based 
NGS
We analyzed concordance between blood-based 
and tumor tissue biopsies in the 23 patients that had both 
blood-based and tumor tissue NGS analyses. We first 
examined four of the most frequently altered genes in 
pancreatic cancer, KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 
(Figure 1D). In the patients with both blood-based and 
tumor tissue NGS, nine (39%) were concordant for KRAS 
status (6 mutants and 3 wild-type). The blood-based NGS 
assays did not detect 14 KRAS variants (61%) that were 
present in the tumor tissue. We noted that in patients 
for whom KRAS mutations were detected in both tumor 
tissue and blood, all tumor samples were biopsied from

liver metastases (Table S4). The low detection rate of 
KRAS mutations in circulating DNA is problematic since 
this gene is mutated in over 90% of PDA tumors in most 
reports [7, 8].
To determine whether technical limitations played 
a part in the low rate of detection of KRAS mutations 
plasma cfDNA, we examined the sequencing quality 
metrics where possible. The median sequencing coverage 
for KRAS mutations in tumor tissue sequenced using the 
FoundationOne panel was 845x, with only one sample 
below 500x, in line with the analytical validation study 
published by Foundation Medicine [9]. Quality control 
metrics were not obtainable for the Guardant360 assay, 
but validation of the assay has demonstrated a depth of 
coverage of 8, 000X and a limit of detection of 0.25% 
[10]. For the ClearID assay, the cell-free DNA yield from 
the plasma samples (n = 8) ranged from 1.2 to 10 ng. Of 
the 4 patients with tumor tissue KRAS mutations but no 
cfDNA KRAS mutations, one of them had a low cell-free 
DNA yield (1.7 ng), while the other three had high yields 
(>8 ng) that were similar to the two patients with KRAS 
mutations detected in both plasma and tumor tissue. This 
indicates that both technological (low cfDNA yields) and 
biological (actual lack of KRAS mutations in the plasma) 
limitations likely play a role.
Identification of well-established PDA drivers in 
cfDNA analysis
In the 23 patients with both blood-based and tumor 
tissue NGS, six (26.1%) were concordant for TP53 status 
(3 mutants and 4 wild-type). The blood-based NGS 
assays did not detect 15 TP53 variants (65.2%) that were 
present in the tumor tissue. The three concordant TP53 
variants were G325*, V272L, and R273C (Figure S1). 
Three patients had differing TP53 mutations in cfDNA-
based and tumor tissue NGS: pan-545 (G389G in cfDNA, 
S261fs*2 in tumor), pan-594 (H193L and V272L in 
cfDNA, only V272L in tumor), and pan-598 (P278S in 
cfDNA, P153fs*28 in tumor).
No mutations in CDKN2A or SMAD4 were detected 
in the blood-based assays (Figure 1D). Mutations in these 
genes were detected in tumor tissue in 11/23 (47.8%) and 
6/23 (26.1%) patients, respectively. A possible reason for 
the absence of these variants in the blood-based NGS 
analysis is that the assays are not validated for gene 
deletions, indels, or splice site mutations. Many of the

CDKN2A (8/11, 73%) and SMAD4 (4/6, 67%) variants 
detected by tissue-based NGS were deletions, indels, or 
splice site mutations and thus would not be expected to be 
detected by the blood-based NGS assays.
Sensitivity and precision of cfDNA-based NGS for 
tumor biopsy mutations
To systematically assess the performance of blood-
based NGS assays across all genes, we determined the 
sensitivity and specificity of the cfDNA-based assay 
using the tumor tissue NGS data as the reference. For this 
analysis, we only considered the patients for whom both 
cfDNA and tumor tissue NGS data were available. Also, 
to be consistent with methodologies described previously 
[10, 11], we only considered the patients in which tumor 
DNA was actually detected in cfDNA, reducing the 
number of patients under consideration to 11. We removed 
a number of alterations from the tumor tissue NGS data 
prior to assessing sensitivity and precision: we removed 
any gene not included on the cfDNA assay panel; we 
removed deletions, indels, and rearrangements (the cfDNA 
panel only detects point mutations and amplifications); 
we removed tumor tissue amplifications for genes whose 
copy number could not be determined by the cfDNA 
assay (amplifications can only be assessed for a subset of 
genes on the cfDNA panel); and we removed tumor tissue 
Figure 1: Panel-normalized number of alterations detected in liquid and tumor tissue biopsies. A. On average, more 
variants were detected in the tumor tissue biopsy (red) than the cfDNA-based assay (blue) in patients with data from both assays available. 
Panel normalization was performed by dividing the number of mutations detected in each patient by the number of genes on the panel (N 
= 321 for tumor tissue, N = 68 for cfDNA, and N = 50 for ctcDNA). B. The number of variants detected in the patients for whom only the 
cfDNA-based assay was performed was similar to that of the cfDNA-based assays in panel A. C. More variants were detected in the tumor 
tissue biopsy (red) than the ctcDNA-based assay (blue). No tumor tissue biopsy was available for the last patient listed, pan-774. D. The 
pancreatic cancer driver genes KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, and CDKN2A were detected less frequently in cfDNA-based biopsies. Patients are 
subdivided according to which biopsies were performed: patients for whom both cfDNA and tumor tissue biopsies were obtained are in the 
left block, while patients for whom only cfDNA biopsies were obtained are in the middle block, and patients with both ctcDNA and tumor 
tissue biopsies are in the right block. Patients for whom tumor quantity was insufficient for tissue-based NGS are shaded in gray. Disease 
burden and treatment response were determined based on the most recent CT scans prior to drawing of blood samples.

mutations in exons not covered by the cfDNA panel. After 
these filters were applied, the remaining dataset consisted 
of 55 alterations across 25 genes. 
The precision and sensitivity of the cfDNA-based 
NGS assay could only be evaluated for the five genes 
for which concordant variants occurred; the remaining 
20 genes were only observed in one of the two assays. 
Precision, defined as the proportion of cfDNA-based 
mutations that were detected in both assays, was 100% for 
KRAS and MYC (Figure 2A), although there was only one 
MYC alteration. Sensitivity, defined as the proportion of 
tumor tissue-based mutations that were detected by both 
assays, was 100% for EGFR (Figure 2B), although there 
was only one EGFR alteration. The remaining genes had 
low values of sensitivity and precision. The high precision/
low sensitivity for KRAS indicated that a KRAS variant 
detected by the cfDNA-based NGS assay is likely present 
in the tumor tissue, although the absence of a KRAS 
variant in cfDNA does not necessarily imply a lack of 
KRAS mutations in tumor tissue. The overall precision and 
sensitivity across all 25 overlapping genes were 40% and 
25%, respectively.
Therapeutic implications for assays tested
We examined mutations that confer drug sensitivity 
to explore differences in the therapeutic implications 
derived from cfDNA-based and tumor tissue-based NGS 
assays. These actionable mutations included ATM and 
PALB2, which may indicate sensitivity to PARP inhibitors 
[12] or platinum agents [13]; CCND2, CDK4, and CDK6, 
which may indicate sensitivity to CDK inhibitors [14, 
15]; AKT1, AKT2, ARID1A, PIK3CA, PIK3CG, and 
STK11, which may indicate sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR 
inhibitors [16]; and the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL, 
EGFR, FGFR1, FLT3, and PDGFRA, which may indicate 
sensitivity to various tyrosine kinase inhibitors [17-21]. 
Consistent with the low overall concordance we observed 
between cfDNA and tumor tissue NGS data, only one 
actionable mutation was detected in the same patient by 
both assays, an EGFR amplification in patient pan-545 
(Figure 3). 
In ten patients with cfDNA analysis and no tumor 
tissue biopsies, three actionable mutations were found 
(Figure 3, middle panel). In eight patients with ctcDNA 
analysis, tumor tissue-based NGS revealed four actionable 
markers, none of which were detected by the ctcDNA 
assay (Figure 3, right panel). These discrepancies between 
tumor tissue-based and blood-based NGS assays indicate 
that further technical improvements are needed before 
blood-based NGS assays can be successfully applied in 
therapeutic decision-making. 
Impact of clinical variables on the detection of 
tumor DNA in plasma
Mutations in circulating DNA were only detected 
in blood-based NGS analysis of 25 (74%) of the patients: 
19 out of 26 (73%) by the cfDNA-based assay and 6 out 
of 8 (75%) by the ctcDNA-based assay. Since one of our 
goals is to detect actionable mutations that can influence 
treatment decisions, it is critical to know when a blood-
based assay is most likely to detect specific tumor DNA 
mutations. Therefore we explored the clinical factors 
related to the presence or absence of detectable mutations 
in the blood. We used the maximum variant allele fraction 
in the blood-based assays as a surrogate for level of 
tumor DNA in the blood [10]. The patients with the six 
highest frequencies of somatic alterations in circulating 
DNA had extensive disease that was present in both the

pancreas and distal metastases (Figure 4A). However, 
ten patients with extensive disease had no detectable 
tumor DNA in the blood. Several other clinical variables, 
including current treatment response status, time since 
most recent treatment, time since diagnosis, and type of 
most recent therapy, were not correlated with the presence 
of mutations in circulating DNA (Figure S3). There was a 
weak correlation (Pearson’s R = 0.41) between the level of 
CA19-9 marker and the maximum variant allele fraction 
(Figure S3C). While a larger sample size is needed to draw 
definitive conclusions, these results indicate that clinical 
covariates may lack strong associations with the presence 
or absence of mutations in cfDNA and therefore may not 
be sufficient indicators of whether a blood-based NGS 
assay will reliably detect tumor mutations. 
Correlation of cfDNA mutations with prognosis
Although the disease burden did not appear to 
be strongly predictive of the presence of mutations in 
circulating DNA, the presence of mutations did have 
prognostic significance. Outcome data was available for 
all patients with a median follow-up (time since blood 
sampling) of 28 weeks. Overall survival was lower in 
the subset of patients in which mutations were detected 
in circulating DNA (n = 24), with 11 deaths occurring in 
this subgroup compared to one in the subgroup with no 
detectable tumor DNA (n = 10) (Figure 4B, log-rank P 
= 0.045). The prognostic significance of the presence of 
mutations in the circulation highlights a possible role for 
blood-based NGS in clinical care of pancreatic cancer 
patients, in keeping with the recent role for CTC analysis 
in monitoring disease burden [22].
DISCUSSION
Despite the promise of noninvasive liquid biopsies, 
our data suggest that circulating DNA-based NGS assays 
do not yet appear ready to replace tumor tissue biopsies 
in detecting actionable mutations for use in pancreatic 
cancer precision oncology strategies. We analyzed a pilot 
study set of consecutively enrolled patients with metastatic 
PDA who were enrolled in a “real-world“ community 
setting, which represents the exact type of target patient 
population that would be most impacted by these 
evolving molecular practices given the high percentage 
of metastatic cancer patients treated at the community 
level. The low concordance between cfDNA-based and 
tumor tissue NGS assays in our data would yield lower 
numbers of actionable mutations if only the cfDNA-based

assay data were available. Given the high frequency of 
KRAS mutations in PDA of over 90% in most reports [7, 
8], we can use this specific genomic alteration as a gold 
standard to gauge technical utility, which provides a 
unique window into cfDNA-tumor tissue concordances. 
Our results showed poor sensitivity of cfDNA blood-
based testing to identify KRAS mutations. However, we 
did find evidence for potential clinical utility based on the 
prognostic significance that we observed (Figure 5B).
Several performance characteristics of blood-
based NGS analysis were similar in our study and other 
published studies that used the same commercial cfDNA-
based NGS assay. Mutations in blood were detected 
in 73% of the cfDNA-based NGS assays here, while in 
other studies this frequency was 86% [10] and 96% [11]. 
We found a median of 2 mutated genes per patient in the 
cfDNA-based NGS assay, while other studies found means 
of 3.3 [10] and 2.8 [11] altered genes per patient. 
A major difference between our data and other 
studies is the very low concordance of genomic alterations 
found between liquid and tumor tissue biopsies (Table 2). 
One study of 165 patients demonstrated 85% sensitivity 
and 80.7% precision in detecting tumor tissue variants 
using cfDNA-based NGS [10]. Another study involving 
17 pancreatic and biliary cancer patients reported an 
overall sensitivity of 90.3% and an overall precision of 
87.5% [11]. A highly specific digital PCR method has 
been used to sequence the plasma cfDNA of pancreatic 
cancer patients with known KRAS mutations, finding 
KRAS mutations in the plasma of 30/34 (88%) patients 
with metastatic disease and 59/121 (49%) patients with 
localized disease (precision could not be evaluated 
because all patients had KRAS mutations) [23]. Our 
sensitivity and precision were much lower, indicating that 
many mutations would be missed in our patient cohort 
without tumor tissue NGS analysis. We also note that 
it is difficult to attribute the low KRAS detection rate in 
our study to technological versus biological limitations. 
However, the yield of cell-free DNA may be useful in this 
regard: in the ctcDNA-based NGS assay, one of the four 
patients with tumor tissue KRAS mutations not present 
in the plasma had a low yield of cfDNA, suggestive of 
technological limitations. The other three patients with 
high cfDNA yields in plasma may therefore be patients 
for whom tumor cells were not actively shedding DNA. A 
larger sample size will be required to determine if there is 
a significant association between plasma cfDNA yield and 
the sensitivity of detection of tumor mutations. In addition 
to the low sensitivity for tumor mutations that should be 
detectable by the blood-based NGS assay, there is a further 
limitation in that deletions, indels, and rearrangements 
cannot be detected by the blood-based NGS assay (but can 
on the tumor tissue NGS assay).
A possible explanation for the low sensitivity is the 
heavily pre-treated nature of our patient population: nearly 
all of our patients had received some form of systemic 
chemotherapy prior to blood-based NGS analysis. 
Chemotherapy likely has a strong impact on the levels of 
cfDNA, making the detection of mutated cfDNA difficult 
in the setting of active therapy, irrespective of the current 
extent of radiographic response at the time the blood 
sample was obtained. Follow-up studies could include a 
stratified population of stage-matched patients comprised 
of treatment-naïve patients, patients responding to therapy

maximum mutant allele fraction in cfDNA or ctcDNA trended higher in patients with extensive disease, although this was not statistically 
significant. B. Overall survival trended lower in patients with detectable tumor DNA in cfDNA (ctDNA+, n = 24) than in those with no 
detectable tumor DNA (ctDNA-, n = 10), with a total of 11 and 1 deaths, respectively.

and patients progressing on first line therapy or beyond.
Our observation that the presence of tumor DNA in 
cfDNA is a negative prognostic factor is consistent with 
numerous other studies. Multiple studies using digital 
PCR have demonstrated that high levels of circulating 
KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer patients adversely 
affect survival [24], [25]. Another group used digital PCR 
to detect alterations in KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA in 
pancreatic cancer patients, demonstrating that detection of 
any of these genes was associated with lower progression-
free survival [26]. The level of mutated cfDNA is 
prognostic in other cancer types as well, with higher levels 
of mutated KRAS and BRAF DNA found in colorectal 
cancer patients with lower survival [27].
The low concordance between tumor tissue and 
cfDNA-based NGS that we observed here indicates that 
further technical development is needed in this specific 
setting of late-stage pancreatic cancer. Nonetheless, 
despite the limitations we observed, we have demonstrated 
that it is feasible to utilize blood-based NGS profiling 
across many different hospitals and community-based 
practices; this is in contrast to other similar studies that 
were conducted at large academic institutions [11, 26]. 
The ability to use the extremely high KRAS mutation 
frequency in pancreatic cancer provided us with an 
important control to directly assess technical feasibility 
of cfDNA based molecular profiling of metastatic cancer 
patients where access to tumor tissue may problematic. 
Moreover, the ability to measure genomic alterations in 
patient matched cfDNA and tumor tissue in consecutively 
consented patients that are enrolling in an “all comers” 
national program that closely mimic what would be 
expected be seen at any point in time in clinics and 
physician offices around the United States provides 
a unique assessment window. Increasing analytical 
sensitivity using techniques such as dPCR could certainly 
increase concordance rates and identify molecular 
alterations where cfDNA concentrations are low in any 
given patient. However at this time, technologies like 
dPCR are not readily available in the community setting, 
where most patients are being treated. In the future, an 
optimized version of these platforms may allow for 
application of a personalized therapeutic approach to a 
greater number of pancreatic cancer cases, particularly 
those in which a tumor biopsy is hard to obtain.

different community oncology practices were enrolled 
and data collected in the registry. Patients were enrolled 
sequentially, during the time frame of this Pilot program. 
Next-generation sequencing of circulating DNA
Whole blood samples were sent to one of two 
commercial laboratories for targeted NGS analysis. The 
Guardant360 test (Guardant Health, Redwood City, CA) 
involves targeted sequencing of a 68-gene panel (Table 
S3B) in cfDNA using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform 
as previously described [28], whereas the ClearID test 
(Cynvenio, Westlake Village, CA) involves targeted 
sequencing of a 50-gene panel (Table S3C) in ctcDNA 
using the IonTorrent PGM platform. In the Guardant360 
test, 20 mL whole blood is stabilized in cell-free DNA 
BCT tubes (Streck, Omaha, NE), which prevent lysis of 
blood cells for up to seven days [29]. In the ClearID test, 
20 mL whole blood is collected into K2EDTA tubes and 
then stabilized in a proprietary fixative, which allows for 
a window of four days between sample collection and 
analysis. The Guardant360 assay generates read depths 
above 8, 000x and has a detection limit for frequencies 
of 0.25% [10]. At an optimal DNA input of 10 ng and 
minimum read depth of 500x, the ClearID test is validated 
for detecting variants at allele frequencies as low as 1% 
[30]. In all but five cases, the labs received the samples 
one day after collection; four samples were in transit for 
two days, and one sample was in transit for four days.
Next-generation sequencing of tumor tissue
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue 
samples were sent to a commercial laboratory for 
NGS testing (FoundationOne, Foundation Medicine, 
Cambridge, MA), which targets a 321-gene panel (Table 
S3A) for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. 
The overlap between panels was high: 65/68 (95.6%) 
genes from the Guardant360 panel were present on the 
FoundationOne panel, while 49/50 (98%) genes from the 
ClearID panel were present on the FoundationOne panel.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed in R. Survival 
differences between patient groups were determined 
using the log-rank test on Kaplan-Meier curves with the R 
survival package [31]. When performing survival analysis, 
follow-up time was defined as the number of weeks since 
blood sampling.

Assay concordance
The concordance between NGS assays was 
evaluated by calculating the gene-level sensitivity 
and precision of blood-based NGS assays in detecting 
mutations present in the tumor tissue, as identified by 
NGS. A gene variant was considered concordant if the 
exact nucleotide change was present in the same gene and 
patient in both blood-based and tumor tissue biopsy.
