IMPORTANCE Current guidelines recommend screening eye examinations for infants with
microcephaly or laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection but not for all infants potentially
exposed to Zika virus in utero.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate eye findings in a cohort of infants whose mothers had polymerase
chain reaction–confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this descriptive case series performed from January 2
through October 30, 2016, infants were examined from birth to 1 year of age by a
multidisciplinary medical team, including a pediatric ophthalmologist, from Fernandes
Figueira Institute, a Ministry of Health referral center for high-risk pregnancies and infectious
diseases in children in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
PARTICIPANTS Mother-infant pairs from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who presented with suspected
Zika virus infection during pregnancy were referred to our institution and had serum, urine,
amniotic fluid, or placenta samples tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for Zika
virus.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Description of eye findings, presence of microcephaly or
other central nervous system abnormalities, and timing of infection in infants with confirmed
Zika virus during pregnancy. Eye abnormalities were correlated with central nervous system
findings, microcephaly, and the timing of maternal infection.
RESULTS Of the 112 with polymerase chain reaction–confirmed Zika virus infection in
maternal specimens, 24 infants (21.4%) examined had eye abnormalities (median age at first
eye examination, 31 days; range, 0-305 days). Ten infants (41.7%) with eye abnormalities did
not have microcephaly, and 8 (33.3%) did not have any central nervous system findings.
Fourteen infants with eye abnormalities (58.3%) were born to women infected in the first
trimester, 8 (33.3%) in the second trimester, and 2 (8.3%) in the third trimester. Optic nerve
and retinal abnormalities were the most frequent findings. Eye abnormalities were
statistically associated with microcephaly (odds ratio [OR], 19.1; 95% CI, 6.0-61.0), other
central nervous system abnormalities (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.6-11.2), arthrogryposis (OR, 29.0;
95% CI, 3.3-255.8), and maternal trimester of infection (first trimester OR, 5.1; 95% CI,
1.9-13.2; second trimester OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-1.2; and third trimester OR, 0.3; 95% CI,
0.1-1.2).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Eye abnormalities may be the only initial finding in congenital
Zika virus infection. All infants with potential maternal Zika virus exposure at any time during
pregnancy should undergo screening eye examinations regardless of the presence or absence
of central nervous system abnormalities.

ika virus is a flavivirus that can be spread by mosquito
vectors, sexual contact, infected blood products, and
perinatal transmission.1 In May 2015, a large outbreak
of Zika virus infection was detected in northeastern Brazil that
yielded an exceedingly high number of microcephaly cases.2
Thereafter, the epidemic rapidly spread to other countries in
the Americas and Asia. In the United States, the first case of
non–travel-related,locallytransmittedZikavirusinfectionwas
reported in Florida in July 2016.3
Although identification of the full spectrum of congeni-
tal Zika virus infection features is still evolving, in its most se-
vere form, congenital Zika virus infection may consist of (1) se-
vere microcephaly with partially collapsed skull, (2) thin
cerebral cortices with subcortical calcifications, (3) macular
scarring and focal pigmentary retinal mottling, (4) arthrogry-
posis, and (5) marked early hypertonia and symptoms of ex-
trapyramidal involvement.4-6 It is evident that microcephaly
is the most remarkable characteristic of this infection but is
not an obligatory finding for the diagnosis of Zika virus con-
genital infection. Furthermore, infants who are seemingly
asymptomatic at birth can later have abnormalities on brain
imaging or subsequent neurologic examinations.4
Our group has recently reported the largest cohort to date
of cases of maternal Zika virus infection during pregnancy con-
firmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.4 After a report7 of local Zika
virus transmission in Rio de Janeiro in 2015, testing of preg-
nant women who presented with a rash at any week of gesta-
tion was initiated for a panel of arboviruses, including Zika vi-
rus, dengue, and chikungunya (by RT-PCR) as well as classic
TORCH (Toxoplasma gondii, Treponema pallidum, varicella-
zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency vi-
rus, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex). Of 126 in-
fantsbornofsymptomaticmotherswhotestedpositiveforZika
virus by RT-PCR, 42% presented with severe abnormal clini-
cal examination findings, brain imaging findings, or both, in-
cluding 4 infants with microcephaly.4
The primary objective of the present study was to report
eye findings in infants born to women with Zika virus con-
firmed by RT-PCR during pregnancy who were referred to our
institution. Secondary objectives included evaluating whether
observable infant eye abnormalities were also associated with
microcephaly, central nervous system findings, the timing of
maternal infection, and arthrogryposis.
Methods
The study was performed at the Fernandes Figueira Institute
(IFF), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which
is a Ministry of Health referral center for high-risk pregnancies
and infectious diseases in children. Pregnancies with con-
firmedZikavirusinfectionwerereferredtotheIFFbytheAcute-
Febrile Illness Service of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, which
is a reference site for arboviral infections in the region and cur-
rentlyrunsaprospectivecohortstudyofmaternalZikavirusin-
fection. In addition, other governmental and private institu-
tions referred pregnant women with fetal abnormalities,
including microcephaly identified by prenatal ultrasonogra-
phy, who subsequently were found to have positive Zika virus
RT-PCR results in amniotic fluid or placenta. The IFF and UCLA
(University of California, Los Angeles) institutional review
boardsapprovedthisstudy.Parentsorguardiansprovidedwrit-
ten informed consent. All data were deidentified.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
All infants born to mothers with RT-PCR results positive for
Zika virus during pregnancy were eligible for enrollment. The
virus was identified in maternal blood, urine, amniotic fluid,
and/or placental tissue samples.
Infants of mothers who did not have maternal specimens
thatwerepositiveforZikavirusbyRT-PCRwereexcludedfrom
enrollment. Infants of mothers with other serologically proven
prenatal infections whose mothers had an RT-PCR result nega-
tive for Zika virus were also excluded. Infants with genetic ab-
normalities, family history of microcephaly, and perinatal al-
cohol or illicit drug exposure whose mothers tested negative
or had no Zika virus RT-PCR results were also excluded.
Study Procedures
Zika virus infection was identified after total RNA extraction
performed with the TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) according to the manufacturer’
s instructions. We per-
formed RT-PCR with the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen)
with the same primers and cycle times as described
elsewhere.4,8 If the mother had symptomatic Zika virus infec-
tion, the timing of maternal infection was defined as the week
of gestation that coincided with symptom onset and a posi-
tive Zika virus RT-PCR result in maternal specimens. For moth-
erswithapositiveRT-PCRresultforaplacentaoramnioticfluid
sample, the timing of infection was assumed to have oc-
curred when the patient presented with symptoms of Zika vi-
rus infection during pregnancy. All women in our cohort had
symptomatic Zika virus infection. Serologic testing for IgG an-
tibodies to dengue (Abcam) and IgM antibodies to chikungu-
nya (Euroimmum) was performed on serum specimens from
mothers. Maternal serum samples were also tested by RT-PCR
for dengue and chikungunya, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovi-
rus (TaqMan; Applied Biosystem, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
Key Points
Question Which infants exposed to Zika virus infection in
pregnancy should undergo an eye examination?
Findings In this case series of a cohort of 112 infants born to
mothers with polymerase chain reaction–confirmed Zika virus
infection, 24 (21.4%) had eye abnormalities. Ten infants (41.7%)
with abnormal eye examination findings did not have
microcephaly, 8 (33.3%) did not have any central nervous system
findings, and 2 (8.3%) had eye abnormalities despite maternal
third trimester infection.
Meaning Eye abnormalities may be the only initial finding in
congenital Zika virus infection, and all infants with potential Zika
virus exposure should undergo screening eye examinations.

 and human immunodeficiency virus (RT HIV Viral Load, Ab-
bott Laboratories). Screening tests for syphilis were per-
formed with Venereal Disease Research Laboratory assays and
confirmed by treponemal assays (Alere Determine Syphilis TP,
Alere).
Detailed demographic, medical, and prenatal history in-
formation and clinical findings were documented by a pedi-
atricinfectiousdiseasesspecialist(M.V.d.S.P.,S.M.P.,orM.S.A.).
Microcephaly was defined as a head circumference z score
smaller than −2 (moderate) or −3 (severe) for gestational age
and sex. Other central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities
were identified by brain imaging (transfontanel ultrasonogra-
phy, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging).
Eye examinations were performed from January 2 through Oc-
tober 30, 2016, and follow-up evaluations were scheduled ev-
ery 3 months until 1 year of age. Eye abnormalities were docu-
mented with a wide-field digital imaging system (RetCam
Shuttle, Clarity Medical Systems) after pupillary dilation.
Statistical Analysis
We evaluated potential associations between infant eye ab-
normalities and maternal trimester of infection, micro-
cephaly, other CNS abnormalities, the timing of maternal in-
fection, and arthrogryposis using the Fisher exact or Pearson
χ2test.Two-sidedP ≤ .05wasconsideredtobestatisticallysig-
nificant. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata statis-
tical software (StataCorp).
Results
Study Population
Two hundred thirty infants were referred to the IFF with pre-
natal microcephaly, with other stigmata of congenital Zika vi-
rus infection, or because they were born to mothers with Zika
virus–positive results during pregnancy as of October 1, 2015.
Ninety-two infants were excluded because of lack of a posi-
tivematernalZikavirusRT-PCRresult.Twenty-sixinfantswith
genetic abnormalities or other infections were excluded from
this analysis because Zika virus infection was ruled out. One
hundred twelve infants underwent eye examinations (me-
dian age at first eye examination, 31 days; range, 0-305 days)
and met the aforementioned inclusion criteria (96 mothers
were positive in plasma, urine, or both and the remaining 16
in amniotic fluid or placental specimens) (Figure 1). Sixty-
two of the 112 patients were from a prospective maternal co-
hort study, which has been previously characterized.4 In ad-
dition, 42 of the 112 infants underwent RT-PCR testing for Zika
virus in blood or urine samples, and 27 of 42 (64.3%) had posi-
tive results.
Among the 112 infants, 20 (17.9%) had microcephaly; 31
(27.7%) had other CNS abnormalities (ventriculomegaly, ce-
rebral calcifications, posterior fossa abnormalities, pachygy-
ria,andlissencephaly),whichwerenotmutuallyexclusive;and
61 (54.5%) had no CNS findings. Thirty-two of 112 mothers
(28.6%) had Zika virus infection in the first trimester of preg-
nancy, 55 (49.1%) in the second, and 25 (22.3%) in the third.
Eye abnormalities were found in 14 of 20 infants (70.0%) with
microcephaly, 2 of 31 (6.5%) with CNS abnormalities without
microcephaly, and 8 of 61 (13.1%) without any CNS abnormal-
ity. Seven of 112 infants (6.3%) had arthrogryposis, eye abnor-
malities (optic nerve atrophy, chorioretinal atrophy, pigment
mottling, and hemorrhage), microcephaly, and other CNS ab-
normalities.
Over time, 78 infants were examined once, 36 were
examined twice, and 8 were examined 3 times in the eye
clinic and by the neurology service staff. Twenty-seven
infants underwent the first examination between the date of
birth and the age of 7 days; of these, 10 (37.0%) had ocular
abnormalities (optic nerve atrophy, focal pigment mottling,
chorioretinal atrophy, and retinal hemorrhages). None had
active exudative lesions.
Eye Abnormalities
Twenty-four of 112 infants (21.4%) presented with sight-
threatening eye abnormalities; impaired optic nerve and/or
retina were the most frequent findings (Table 1). Severe uni-
lateral microphthalmia was present in 1 infant (4.2%), which
prevented retina and optic nerve examination in the affected
eye. Nineteen infants (79.2%) had optic nerve abnormalities
(18 bilateral and 1 unilateral): 11 with bilateral optic nerve at-
rophy (pallor and increased cup), 7 with optic nerve hypopla-
sia (6 bilateral and 1 unilateral), and 1 with bilateral colo-
boma.The4infantswithbilateralnormalopticnervepresented
with bilateral pigment mottling (1 infant) or retinal hemor-
rhages(3infants).Fifteeninfantspresentedwithabnormalreti-
nas: focal pigment mottling (only finding in 4 infants), cho-
rioretinal atrophy (6 infants: 3 bilateral and 3 unilateral),
hemorrhages (4 infants: 3 bilateral), and bilateral inferior colo-
boma (1 infant). The 7 infants with bilateral normal retinas had
optic nerve atrophy (6 infants) and optic nerve hypoplasia
(1 infant). Nystagmus was found in 6 of 24 infants (25.0%) with

 nancy. Thus, we evaluated a cohort of 112 infants from Rio de
Janeiro in which 21.4% of infants were found to have abnor-
mal eye findings. There was bias of ascertainment because
some pregnant women with suspected Zika virus infection
werereferredforevaluation.Priorstudies9-16detailingeyefind-
ings in congenital Zika virus infection did not have a strict case
definition based on diagnostic RT-PCR results. Most cases pre-
viously describing eye abnormalities were from northeastern
Brazil (eTable in the Supplement).
Other congenital infections, such as rubella, toxoplasmo-
sis, cytomegalovirus, and herpes, can manifest as retinal pig-
mentarymottling,chorioretinalscars,opticnerveatrophy,and
microphthalmia. In rubella infection, the pigment mottling is
usually diffuse compared with the focal pigment mottling seen
in Zika virus infection. Optic nerve hypoplasia is believed to
occur secondary to failure of development of ganglion cells of
the retina and is seldom seen in rubella, toxoplasmosis, her-
pes, and cytomegalovirus congenital infections. Infants with
congenital toxoplasmosis can present with active exudative
chorioretinal lesions or a regressed scar, usually macular or
peripapillary. However, chorioretinal lesions found in infants
with Zika virus congenital infection were atrophic and colo-
bamatous-like and could be found in the macula or retinal pe-
riphery (Figure 2).9-12 The most characteristic optic nerve

 abnormalities were atrophy (pallor and increased optic cup)
and hypoplasia, which can occur separately or in combina-
tion with retinal pigment mottling and chorioretinal atrophy,
as previously described.9-12 Chorioretinal atrophy is usually as-
sociated with pigment mottling and can occur without optic
nerve abnormalities.
Nearly half of the infants (41.7%) with confirmed congen-
ital Zika virus infection had eye abnormalities as the first evi-
dent manifestation of Zika virus disease. All but 8 infants also
had CNS abnormalities on neuroimaging. It appears that iso-
lated eye pathologic findings with no CNS findings on imaging
can still occur in third trimester Zika virus infection, as seen
in our cohort. In general, infections in the third trimester of
pregnancy are believed to be relatively nonteratogenic to the
infant because organogenesis is largely complete.17 However,
the retina and other eye structures are still developing after
birth. We would not expect, however, for a third trimester in-
fection to cause optic nerve coloboma, as seen in one of our
cases, because closure of the optic fissure typically occurs by
7 weeks of gestational age. This finding could be explained by
earlier trimester infection with persistence of viremia until the
third trimester. However, the coloboma may have been unre-
latedtoZikavirusinfection.18,19Venturaandcolleagues12found
that ocular involvement in presumed Zika virus congenital in-
fection was more often seen in infants whose mothers re-
ported symptoms during the first trimester of pregnancy. Our
study confirmed this finding.
Of interest, progression of eye findings did not seem to oc-
cur among the 12 infants who returned for follow-up. Ophthal-
miclesionsseemedtoreflectdisruptionofdevelopmentorscar-
ring rather than ongoing active and progressive infection.
Current Brazilian Ministry of Health guidelines recom-
mend screening eye examinations for infants born in areas en-
demic for Zika virus only in the presence of microcephaly.20
Our findings indicate that eye abnormalities are not re-
strictedtoinfantswithmicrocephaly,whichisinlinewithother
studies.13,21Furthermore,wefoundthateyeabnormalitieswere
not limited to infants with CNS abnormalities, which is an im-
portant finding. Current Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention guidelines recommend eye screening only in preg-
nancies with laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus
infection.22 Such tests might not be widely available, which
jeopardizes identification of eye pathologic findings.
Therefore, microcephaly, presence of other CNS manifes-
tations, and laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus in-
fection are inadequate inclusion criteria for screening eye ab-
normalities. If the presence of CNS abnormalities were used
as screening criteria for eye examination in our population,
3 infants with abnormal eye examination findings would have
been missed. Universal screening is the only way to capture
all eye findings associated with congenital Zika virus infec-
tion, but this is not always possible given the limited avail-
ability of ophthalmologists. Digital retinal imaging with re-
mote image interpretation (teleretinal imaging) is an emerging
health care technology that has been used to screen retinopa-
thy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathy and could be ex-
tended to patients in areas endemic for Zika virus.23-25
When eye abnormalities were first reported in cases of pre-
sumed Zika virus infection with microcephaly,9-11 it was un-
clear whether eye abnormalities were secondary to the pres-
enceofmicrocephalyorattributabletoZikavirusinfection.26-28
Our study putatively solves this issue by reporting that 10 of
24 eye abnormalities (41.7%) occurred in the absence of mi-
crocephaly in RT-PCR–confirmed cases of Zika virus infec-
tion. Thus, it seems that Zika virus can be deemed to be di-
rectly related to eye pathologic findings.
Limitations
Our study is limited by a referral bias for microcephaly and
other stigmata of congenital Zika virus infection. Although we
enrolled 62 patients from our prospective maternal cohort
study, the present analysis also included patients referred to
the IFF for investigation of potential Zika virus congenital in-
fection. Because our institution is a tertiary care center, our
data cannot be extrapolated to provide information about the
risk of eye abnormalities, microcephaly, or CNS disease in the
general population in areas where Zika virus is endemic. How-
ever, our data are unique because we describe pathogno-
monic eye lesions associated with congenital Zika virus infec-
tion in the largest cohort of infants born to mothers infected
with RT-PCR–proven Zika virus to date.
Another major limitation of our study is the lack of a con-
trol group. We cannot affirm with absolute certainty that all
eye findings were attributable to Zika virus infection. In par-
ticular, 3 of 24 infants (12.5%) had findings of retinal hemor-
rhageonly.Itispossiblethatthesefindingswererelatedtobirth
trauma rather than Zika virus infection.
Conclusions
Eye abnormalities may be the only initial finding in congeni-
tal Zika virus infection. All infants with potential Zika virus ex-
posure should undergo screening eye examinations regard-
less of CNS abnormalities, timing of maternal infection during
pregnancy, or laboratory confirmation.
