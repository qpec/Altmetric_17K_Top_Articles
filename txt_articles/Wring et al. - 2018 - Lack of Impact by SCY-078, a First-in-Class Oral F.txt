Abstract
SCY-078, the first in a new class of β 1,3-glucan synthesis inhibitors, is being developed as an oral and intravenous antifungal treatment for Candida
and Aspergillus species fungal infections. In vitro, studies indicated SCY-078 is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 with markedly lower effect
over other CYP isozymes. To examine clinically relevant effects of the potential interaction with SCY-078, this phase 1, open-label, 2-period crossover
study evaluated the pharmacokinetic parameters of rosiglitazone, a sensitive substrate of CYP2C8 metabolism, in the absence and presence of SCY-
078 dosed to therapeutically relevant SCY-078 concentration exposure after repeat dosing. Healthy adult subjects were randomized to 2 treatment
sequences: a single oral 4-mg rosiglitazone dose alone on day 1 or a 1250-mg SCY-078 loading dose on day 1 followed by a once-daily 750-mg SCY-
078 dose for an additional 7 days (reflecting the clinical regimen evaluated during phase 2 studies for infections by Candida species) and concurrent
administration of a single oral 4-mg rosiglitazone dose on day 3, before alternating following a �10-day washout. The exposure to SCY-078 observed
in this study was in line with the intended exposure for treatment of invasive fungal infections.The 90% confidence intervals for rosiglitazone exposure
geometric mean ratios were within the prespecified no effect interval of 0.70-1.43. Additionally, maximum concentration values for rosiglitazone and
its metabolite, N–desmethylrosiglitazone, were not significantly affected by co-administration with SCY-078. Overall, rosiglitazone exposure was not
impacted to a clinically meaningful extent with co-administration of therapeutically relevant SCY-078 concentration exposure after repeat dosing.The
results are indicative of low risk for interaction of SCY-078 with drugs metabolized via the CYP family of enzymes.

Morbidity and mortality associated with invasive Can-
dida and Aspergillus species fungal infections remains
a cause for concern in the health-care environment;
candidemia is reported to be the third or fourth most
common cause of health-care–associated bloodstream
infection in US hospitals.1,2 Three main classes of
antifungal agents are currently available for the treat-
ment of these invasive infections: azoles, polyenes, and
echinocandins.3 However, the emergence of strains that
are resistant to azoles and echinocandins indicates the
need for new agents that retain activity against resistant
strains.4,5
SCY-078, an enfumafungin derivative, represents the
first compound of the triterpenoid class of β 1,3-glucan
synthesis inhibitors in development for the treatment
of fungal infections.6 SCY-078 was documented to
have potent in vitro activity against Candida and As-
pergillus species clinical isolates, and retained activity
against azole-resistant, most echinocandin-resistant,
and multidrug-resistant strains of Candida species.7–10
SCY-078 recently met primary end points in two phase
2 clinical studies in invasive candidiasis and vulvovagi-
nal candidiasis,11,12 which evaluated a 1250-mg loading
dose on day 1 followed by once-daily doses of 750 mg.
A loading dose strategy was employed to achieve a ther-
apeutically relevant antifungal concentration in plasma
on the first day of treatment, as early target attainment
has been correlated with improved patient outcomes.1

Thus, this novel antifungal agent represents a new class
of non-azole, orally bioavailable treatment for Candida
and Aspergillus species infections, having the potential
to treat multidrug-resistant fungal isolates.6
In vitro, SCY-078 was shown to be a possible
inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 (CYP2C8;
50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] �0.3 μM) and a
substrate for CYP3A4. The potential for SCY-078 to
inhibit other CYP isoforms is weaker, as IC50 values
were >5-fold higher (Wring SA, Park SM, unpublished
data on file). Therefore, the purpose of this study
was to examine the clinically relevant effects of any
interaction of SCY-078 with drugs metabolized by
CYP2C8, reflecting the highest potential for a CYP-
mediated drug-drug interaction. Regulatory guidance
published by the US Food and Drug Administration
suggests that repaglinide may be employed as a sensitive
substrate of CYP2C8 metabolism; however, it is also
a substrate of the drug transporter organic anion
transporting polypeptide 1B1 and is not, therefore, rec-
ommended for clinical drug-drug interaction studies if
potential interactions between the coadministered drug
and the transporter have not been fully elucidated.13
As an alternative, rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione
antidiabetic agent, is a sensitive substrate of CYP2C8
metabolism and is not impacted by drug transporter
interactions.14,15 As no clinical interaction studies have
been performed between SCY-078 and organic anion
transporting polypeptide 1B1substrates, rosiglitazone
was selected as the prototypical substrate for the cur-
rent study. Rosiglitazone is metabolized primarily by
CYP2C8 via N-demethylation and p-hydroxylation and
has been used as a prototypical substrate to assess po-
tential drug-drug interactions with potential inhibitors
of this CYP isoform.15–17 These studies typically assess
the impact of potential CYP2C8 inhibitors on the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of rosiglitazone and on the
formation of its metabolite, N-desmethylrosiglitazone.
As SCY-078 is a potential inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro
and peak plasma concentration of SCY-078 follow-
ing administration of the proposed therapeutic dosing
regimen is expected to be in the range of potentially
inhibitory concentration,11,12 the present study was
performed to determine the potential of SCY-078 to
decrease the metabolism of drugs that are primarily
metabolized by CYP2C8 in vivo. SCY-078 is not metab-
olized by CYP2C8 and is not considered at risk of being
a victim of drug-drug interactions on co-administration
with CYP2C8 substrates or inhibitors. Therefore, the
objective of this study was to compare the plasma
PK parameters of rosiglitazone and its metabolite, N-
desmethylrosiglitazone, when rosiglitazone was admin-
istered alone and when it was coadministered with
SCY-078 dosed to therapeutically relevant SCY-078
concentration exposure after repeat dosing.
Methods
Study Design
The study protocol and other study documents, includ-
ing written informed consent forms, received approval
from the IntegReview Institutional Review Board (3815
S. Capital of Texas Highway, Suite 320, Austin, Texas
78704) before the study was initiated. All subjects
provided written informed consent before participating
in the study, which was obtained in adherence with
Good Clinical Practice. The study was conducted in full
compliance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonization
guidelines, and all applicable US Code of Federal
Regulations.
This was a phase 1, open-label, 2-period crossover
study conducted in healthy adult male and female sub-
jects. Subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment
sequence (AB or BA), using a computer-generated ran-
domization schedule, and were studied in 2 periods (pe-
riod 1 and period 2) separated by a minimum washout
of 10 days. After the washout period, subjects crossed
over and received the alternate treatment (Figure 1).
Treatment A.
Treatment A was a single oral 4-mg
dose of rosiglitazone maleate (GlaxoSmithKline; 1 × 4-
mg capsule) administered alone on day 1. Blood sam-
ples for PK analysis of rosiglitazone and its metabolite,
N-desmethylrosiglitazone, were collected prior to dos-
ing (time 0) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48,
72, 96, and 120 hours after dosing.
Treatment B.
Treatment B was an oral 1250-mg
loading dose of SCY-078 citrate (SCYNEXIS, Inc.;
5 × 250-mg tablets) on day 1, followed by a once-daily
750-mg dose of SCY-078 citrate (3 × 250-mg tablets)
for an additional 7 days. On day 3 of treatment B,
subjects also received concurrent administration of a
single oral 4-mg dose of rosiglitazone. Blood samples
for PK analysis of SCY-078 were collected prior to
dosing (day 1, time 0) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16,
and 24 hours after dosing and prior to dosing (day 3)
and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours after dosing.
Blood samples for PK analysis of rosiglitazone and
its metabolite, N-desmethylrosiglitazone, were collected
prior to dosing (day 3, time 0) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
12, 16, 24 (day 4), 36, 48 (day 5), 72 (day 6), 96 (day 7),
and 120 (day 8) hours after dosing. Blood samples for
determination of trough SCY-078 concentrations were
collected prior to dosing (on days 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).
Study Procedure.
For both treatment A and B, sub-
jects were admitted to the clinical site on the evening
of day −1 of each period. Subjects were required
to remain at the clinic for at least 72 hours after
dosing or until discharged and were required to return

to the clinic for subsequent doses and blood sample
collections. On dosing days, study medications were
administered to subjects in a fasted state. Subjects were
required to fast (except for water) for 10 hours prior
to dosing with rosiglitazone and SCY-078. Water was
restricted for 1 hour before until 1 hour after drug
administration.
While in the research facility, meals were provided at
4 and 10 hours after dosing and a snack was offered at
7 and 13 hours after dosing. For each treatment period,
the timing, composition, and calorie content of meals
were equivalent. After the 24-hour postdose procedures
were complete, the timing, consumption, and calorie
content of meals were unrestricted.
Approximately 2 weeks prior to administration of
the initial dose of the study drug, throughout the study,
and until the post-study visit, subjects were required
to refrain from consumption of grapefruit juice, grape-
fruits, grapefruit products, star fruit, blood oranges,
apple juice and mulberry juice, vegetables from the
mustard green family, and charbroiled meats. Subjects
were also required to refrain from alcohol within 1 week
prior to the administration of the initial dose of the
study drug, throughout the study, and until the final
study visit day; refrain from consumption of caffeinated
beverages for 48 hours prior to clinical admission
and throughout the study; refrain from consumption
of all juices 24 hours prior to and 24 hours after
administration of study drug on PK sampling days;
refrain from smoking throughout the study and post-
study evaluation; and avoid all unusual or strenuous
activity from the screening visit, throughout the study,
and until the post-study visit.
Study Population
Inclusion Criteria.
The study population consisted of
healthy (based on medical history, physical examina-
tion, vital sign measurements, laboratory safety tests,
and 12-lead electrocardiograms at screening and/or
prior to administration of the initial dose of the study
drug), male and female volunteers aged 18-50 years
(inclusive), with a body mass index of �32 kg/m2, at
screening. Subjects were nonsmokers who had not used
nicotine or nicotine-containing products for at least
6 months. Female subjects were not to be pregnant and
highly unlikely to become pregnant; male subjects must
have been unlikely to impregnate a partner. All subjects
were willing to comply with the study restrictions and
participate for the full length of the study.
Exclusion Criteria.
Subjects with an estimated crea-
tinine clearance �80 mL/min, a history of macular
edema or heart failure, or who were at risk of QT
prolongation or torsade de pointes, were excluded
from the study. Additionally, subjects with a history
of stroke, chronic seizures, major neurological disor-
ders, or clinically significant endocrine, gastrointesti-
nal, cardiovascular, hematologic, immunologic, renal,
respiratory, metabolic, dermatologic, or genitourinary
abnormalities or diseases, or neoplastic disease, were
excluded from the study, as were subjects with a history
of liver disease or clinically significant elevated liver
enzymes. Also excluded were subjects who had major
surgery or lost 1 unit of blood within 4 weeks prior to
screening or who have multiple allergies or allergies to
rosiglitazone or its inactive ingredients.

The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology / Vol 58 No 10 2018
Prior to the initial administration of the study drug
and throughout the study until the post-study visit,
subjects refrained from the use of any medication
(including prescription and nonprescription drugs or
herbal remedies). All medications taken within 28 days
prior to randomization and until 14 days after the last
dose of study medication were recorded.
Pharmacokinetic Sample Analysis
Blood
samples
collected
after
24
hours
after
dosing could have been taken up to ±15 minutes
from the scheduled time points. All samples were
collected
in
tubes
containing
dipotassium
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to ensure stability of
SCY-078 in human plasma. Samples were centrifuged
at 2000 g within 2 hours of collection, frozen within
1 hour of centrifugation, and stored at approximately
−70°C
before
analysis.
SCY-078,
rosiglitazone,
and N-desmethylrosiglitazone concentrations in the
plasma samples were determined by Agilux Labo-
ratories (Worcester, Massachusetts) using validated
liquid
chromatography-tandem
mass
spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) methods.
Safety Analysis
Safety and tolerability were monitored by clinical as-
sessment of adverse experiences and by clinical and
laboratory measurements, including vital signs (heart
rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature),
physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and
standard laboratory safety tests (hematology, coagula-
tion, chemistry, and urinalysis). Adverse events (AEs)
were collected from the time of informed consent until
14 days after the last dose of study medication.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analysis was performed with SAS Version
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Primary
and secondary PK end points in this study included
AUC and maximum observed plasma concentration
(Cmax) values for rosiglitazone. Overall, drug exposure
(ie, AUC) was considered to be the most relevant PK
parameter for this study.
It is considered that AUC and Cmax parameters for
SCY-078, rosiglitazone, and N-desmethylrosiglitazone
are likely to be log-normally distributed; therefore,
these variables were log transformed before analysis.18
Confidence
intervals
(CIs)
constructed
for
PK
parameters were based on a linear mixed effects
model containing a fixed effect for treatment and a
random effect for subject.
A 90%CI was generated from the above linear
mixed effect model for the AUC geometric mean ratio
(GMR; test [rosiglitazone coadministered with SCY-
078]/reference [rosiglitazone alone]) and compared with
the prespecified interval (0.70-1.43). The hypothesis
that the co-administration of the therapeutic dose
regimen of SCY-078 does not alter the single-dose of
rosiglitazone 4 mg in a clinically meaningful manner
would be supported if the 90%CI for the rosiglitazone
AUC GMR (test/reference) was contained within the
interval (0.70-1.43).16 Similar analysis was applied to
Cmax, with a point estimate and 90%CI provided for the
Cmax GMR (test/reference).
Determination of Population Size.
Assuming an ex-
pected mean exposure ratio of 1.20 for test/reference
and an intrasubject coefficient of variation percentage
(CV%) of 24%, a sample size of 24 subjects was
considered sufficient to achieve the 90%CIs within
the interval of 0.70-1.43 on the GMRs for plasma
rosiglitazone AUC.15 Discontinued subjects were not
replaced in this study, as a sample size of 17 subjects
was anticipated to be adequate to address the primary
study objective and achieve the expected GMR and
90%CIs. Based on the observed GMRs and variability
in the 17 subjects included in the PK analyses, the
beta value was >0.90 for 0.70-1.43 boundaries, as well
as for 0.80-1.25 boundaries for the AUC of rosigli-
tazone and N-desmethylrosiglitazone and for Cmax of
N-desmethylrosiglitazone. The Cmax for rosiglitazone
was more variable than for the N-desmethyl metabolite
and the beta value for rosiglitazone Cmax based on 17
subjects was 0.65.
Safety Analyses.
All AEs were tabulated for each
SCY-078 dose at the relevant time points. AEs were
coded using the most recent version of the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.
Bioanalysis
of
Plasma
Samples.
Samples
were
provided to Agilux Laboratories, Inc. (Worchester,
Massachusetts) for bioanalysis. All samples were
assayed using Good Laboratory Practices-validated
reversed-phase
LC-MS/MS
methods
and
utilized
calibration
standards,
quality
controls,
study
samples. Incurred sample re-analyses met acceptance
criteria. SCY-078 plasma samples were analyzed
for the presence of SCY-078 according to Agilux
Laboratories’ Method BAC-SI-L001 “Analysis of
SCY-078 in K2EDTA Human Plasma by LC-MS/MS.”
Additional plasma samples were analyzed for the
presence of rosiglitazone and N-desmethylrosiglitazone
according to Agilux Laboratories Method BAC-AG-
L011, “Analysis of Rosiglitazone and its Metabolite N-
Desmethyl Rosiglitazone in Human K2EDTA Plasma
by LC-MS/MS.” The lower limit of quantitation
(LLOQ) for the LC-MS/MS method for rosiglitazone
and N-desmethylrosiglitazone in human plasma was
0.500 ng/mL and for SCY-078 in human plasma

Results
Study Population
A total of 24 subjects were enrolled in the study
and randomized to treatment; 21 subjects received all
planned treatment doses; 20 subjects completed all
study procedures. One subject received all treatment but
did not return for the post-study visit and was con-
sidered lost to follow-up, two subjects withdrew from
the study after receiving the loading dose of 1250 mg
SCY-078, and one subject was discontinued due to a
positive cotinine test prior to period 2, having received
1 dose of 4-mg rosiglitazone. The baseline demographic
characteristics of study subjects are shown in Table 1.
Pharmacokinetics of Rosiglitazone Following a Single Dose
Administered Alone and When Coadministered With
Repeat Doses of SCY-078
Plasma concentration-time profiles for rosiglitazone
following a single 4-mg dose of rosiglitazone (day 1)
and when coadministered with SCY-078 dosed to ther-
apeutically relevant SCY-078 concentration exposure
after repeat dosing (day 3) are shown in Figure 2.
Rosiglitazone PK parameters and results of statistical
analyses of rosiglitazone PK parameters following ad-
ministration alone and when coadministered with SCY-
078 are shown in Table 2.
Administration of rosiglitazone alone resulted in
a geometric mean AUC of 1464 μg·hr/mL, Cmax of
295.1 ng/mL, area under the plasma concentration-time
curve from 0 to 24 hours after dose administration
(AUC0-24h) of 1445 μg·hr/mL, and a median time
point where Cmax is observed (Tmax) of 0.5 hours.

Least squares mean values based on test/reference
GMR (90%CI) results of AUC, Cmax, and AUC0-24h
were 0.99 (0.90-1.10), 0.80 (0.70-0.90), and 0.98 (0.89-
1.08), respectively (Table 2). These GMRs and upper
90%CI values were within the prespecified interval of
0.70-1.43, indicating that these rosiglitazone parame-
ters were not significantly affected by co-administration
with SCY-078. The median Tmax when rosiglitazone
was coadministered with SCY-078 was 1 hour com-
pared with 0.5 hours when rosiglitazone was adminis-
tered alone. This difference was statistically significant
(P < .001) but not considered clinically meaningful
(Table 2).

Safety and Tolerability
Overall, rosiglitazone in the presence and absence of
repeat doses of SCY-078 was generally well tolerated.
The most common treatment-emergent AEs were di-
arrhea (14 subjects, 58.3%), abdominal pain (10 sub-
jects, 41.7%), nausea (10 subjects, 41.7%), vomiting (6
subjects, 25%), headache (4 subjects, 16.7%), dizziness
(2 subjects, 8.3%), somnolence (2 subjects, 8.3%), men-
struation irregularity (3 subjects, 12.5%), and contact
dermatitis (2 subjects, 8.3%). All treatment-emergent
AEs were mild or moderate in intensity; there were no
serious AEs reported during the study and no deaths.
The majority of gastrointestinal AEs were self-limiting
and associated with the loading dose of SCY-078.
Discussion
Emerging strains of invasive fungi Candida and As-
pergillus species that are resistant to one or both
of the main classes of antifungal agents, azoles and
echinocandins, signify the need for new agents for
the treatment of these life-threatening infections.4,5
An enfumafungin derivative being developed for the
treatment of fungal infections, SCY-078, retains ac-
tivity against azole-resistant and most echinocandin-
resistant strains in vitro and, as such, could represent
an important alternative for the treatment of Candida
and Aspergillus species infections.7–9
SCY-078 is an in vitro inhibitor of
CYP2C8
(IC50 for inhibition of CYP2C8-mediated N-desethyl-
amodiaquine activity �0.3 μM) and a substrate for
CYP3A4; in vitro CYP450 interaction data indicated
a low risk of interaction with other CYP isoforms
(Wring SA, Park SH, unpublished data on file). The
maximum concentration of SCY-078 in plasma on day
3 for the once-daily oral dose regimen (after a loading
oral dose of 1250 mg on day 1 and further repeat
daily oral doses of 750-mg SCY-078 on days 2 and 3
to subjects who fasted overnight) in the current study
was �0.93 μg/mL (1.28 μM). This value exceeds the
in vitro IC50 by approximately 4-fold, although the cor-
responding unbound concentration in plasma (based
on 99.7% binding to plasma proteins) is markedly lower,
at �3% of the IC50.6 Thus, although in vitro data
indicated that interaction with CYP2C8 substrates is
possible based on total levels, they were considered
unlikely based on unbound drug levels. To examine the
clinically relevant effects of the potential interaction
of SCY-078 with drugs metabolized via CYP2C8, the
objective of this phase 1 study was to compare the
PK parameters of rosiglitazone, a sensitive substrate of
CYP2C8 metabolism, in the presence and absence of
therapeutically relevant SCY-078 concentration expo-
sure after repeat dosing in healthy subjects.
The primary objective of the study was to compare
the plasma AUC of rosiglitazone after a single oral
rosiglitazone dose and when coadministered with re-
peat doses of SCY-078. The results of this study show
that co-administration of rosiglitazone with therapeu-
tically relevant SCY-078 concentration exposure after
 1312
The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology / Vol 58 No 10 2018
repeat dosing had no effect on rosiglitazone exposure
compared with administration of rosiglitazone alone.
In addition, maximum concentration values for rosigli-
tazone and its metabolite, N-desmethylrosiglitazone,
were similar with co-administration of repeat dose
SCY-078. Although there was a slight delay in rosigli-
tazone and N-desmethylrosiglitazone Tmax with co-
administration of repeat dose SCY-078, this appeared
clinically insignificant. SCY-078 was well absorbed
following the loading dose and repeated daily doses
and rosiglitazone, in the presence and absence of repeat
dose SCY-078, was generally well tolerated. A loading
dose strategy was employed for consistency with phase
2 studies designed to achieve a therapeutically relevant
antifungal concentration in plasma on the first day of
treatment. Two additional daily doses of 750-mg SCY-
078 (days 2 and 3) resulted in somewhat higher geomet-
ric mean (CV%) AUC0-24h of 14.82 (42.9) μg·hr/mL and
Cmax of 0.934 (43.3) μg/mL values. This does not neg-
atively influence the primary result of this study, that
therapeutically relevant exposures after repeat doses of
SCY-078 do not inhibit rosiglitazone, a substrate drug
cleared by CYP2C8 metabolism.
In vitro CYP450 interaction data indicated a 5-
to 16-fold lower risk of interaction of SCY-078 with
other CYP isoforms (Wring SA, Park SM, unpub-
lished data on file). Indeed, no clinically relevant in-
teraction was observed in a recent phase 1 drug-drug
interaction study between SCY-078 and the CYP3A
and P-glycoprotein substrate tacrolimus.19 The absence
of interaction with rosiglitazone, a sensitive probe of
CYP2C8, along with the in vitro data demonstrating
lower risk for interaction with other CYP isoforms
and the results from the recent tacrolimus interaction
study19 indicate a low risk of clinically meaningful in-
teraction when SCY-078 is coadministered at therapeu-
tically relevant repeat dose exposures with drugs me-
tabolized via the CYP450 pathway. This is particularly
relevant considering that the only oral antifungal agents
currently available for the treatment of invasive fungal
infections, azoles, are known inhibitors of the CYP450
metabolic pathway, complicating the management of
patients with these severe infections, who are often
receiving multiple drugs.
Conclusions
Overall, the results from this study demonstrated
that rosiglitazone, a sensitive CYP2C8 substrate, and
N-desmethylrosiglitazone plasma PKs were not af-
fected to a clinically meaningful extent in the presence
of therapeutically relevant SCY-078 concentration ex-
posure after repeat dosing of SCY-078. As SCY-078
elicits markedly weaker inhibitory potential of other
CYP enzymes, the current study suggests a low risk for
interaction with drugs metabolized via the CYP family
of enzymes.
