IMPORTANCE Vitamin B12, folate, and sulfur amino acids may be modifiable risk factors for
structural brain changes that precede clinical dementia.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of circulating levels of vitamin B12, red blood cell
folate, and sulfur amino acids with the rate of total brain volume loss and the change in white
matter hyperintensity volume as measured by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in older
adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The magnetic resonance imaging subsample of the
Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen, a population-based longitudinal
study in Stockholm, Sweden, was conducted in 501 participants aged 60 years or older who
were free of dementia at baseline. A total of 299 participants underwent repeated structural
brain magnetic resonance imaging scans from September 17, 2001, to December 17, 2009.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The rate of brain tissue volume loss and the progression of
total white matter hyperintensity volume.
RESULTS In the multi-adjusted linear mixed models, among 501 participants (300 women
[59.9%]; mean [SD] age, 70.9 [9.1] years), higher baseline vitamin B12 and holotransco-
balamin levels were associated with a decreased rate of total brain volume loss during the
study period: for each increase of 1 SD, β (SE) was 0.048 (0.013) for vitamin B12 (P < .001) and
0.040 (0.013) for holotranscobalamin (P = .002). Increased total homocysteine levels were
associated with faster rates of total brain volume loss in the whole sample (β [SE] per 1-SD
increase, –0.035 [0.015]; P = .02) and with the progression of white matter hyperintensity
among participants with systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg (β [SE] per 1-SD
increase, 0.000019 [0.00001]; P = .047). No longitudinal associations were found for red
blood cell folate and other sulfur amino acids.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that both vitamin B12 and total
homocysteine concentrations may be related to accelerated aging of the brain. Randomized
clinical trials are needed to determine the importance of vitamin B12 supplementation on
slowing brain aging in older adults.

itaminB12andfolatearecloselyconnectedwiththeme-
tabolism of homocysteine, a sulfur-containing non-
essential amino acid. Inadequate levels of either
vitamin can result in increased concentrations of total homo-
cysteine (tHcy).1 High levels of tHcy and low levels of vitamin
B12andfolatearecommonintheelderlyandareassociatedwith
a variety of disorders, including cardiovascular and cerebro-
vascular conditions.2-5 In addition, they may influence brain
structure through several mechanisms.4 In older adults, sub-
stantial cerebral atrophy is associated with a diagnosis of de-
mentia, which is maintained in very advanced age.6,7 Whereas
few longitudinal studies have linked low vitamin B12 or folate
levels with structural brain changes,8,9 others did not report
suchassociations.9-11HigherbloodlevelsoftHcyhavealsobeen
associated with an increased rate of brain atrophy10-14 and
progression of white matter lesion volume,15 although the
evidence is inconsistent.9,11
Holotranscobalamin (holoTC), the biologically active
fraction of vitamin B12, may be a more sensitive marker of vi-
tamin B12 levels.16 However, to our knowledge, very few
longitudinal studies have investigated the association of
holoTC with brain volumes.9 In addition, the effect of sulfur
amino acids other than homocysteine on brain aging has rarely
been investigated.17

Methods
Study Population
The study population was derived from the Swedish National
Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), a popu-
lation-based prospective study conducted in the Kungshol-
menareaofcentralStockholm,Sweden.SNAC-Kinvolvesaran-
dom sample of persons aged 60 years or older who live either
at home or in an institution. Because of more rapid changes
in health and a higher attrition rate among older age groups,
sampling is stratified by age cohort. Assessments take place
at 6-year intervals for younger cohorts (ages 60, 66, 72, and
78 years) and at 3-year intervals for older cohorts (ages 81, 84,
87, 90, 93, 96, and ≥99 years). From 2001 to 2004, of the 4590
living and eligible individuals randomly selected for SNAC-K,
3363 (73.3%) participated in the baseline examination.18,19 The
Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet and the Regional
Ethical Review Board in Stockholm approved the protocols of
each phase of SNAC-K and written informed consent was pro-
vided by all participants.
At baseline and each follow-up, the SNAC-K participants
underwent a thorough clinical examination, interview, and as-
sessments by a physician, a registered nurse, and a psycholo-
gist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, medical his-
tory, drug use, and cognitive function were collected according
to a structured protocol, and the diagnosis of dementia was
made according to DSM-IV criteria.20 Data on vitamin supple-
ment use were collected from study participants and verified
byinspectingdrugprescriptionsandcontainers.Systolicblood
pressure (SBP) was measured twice using the participant’
s left
arm after sitting for 5 minutes, and the mean of the measure-
ments was calculated (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Brain Imaging Cohort
From September 17, 2001, to September 10, 2003, a total of 555
participants who were nondisabled, noninstitutionalized, and
without dementia underwent a structural magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) scan; participants were followed up
throughDecember17,2009.21ParticipantswhoseMRIscanwas
of poor quality (n = 16) or who had a possible diagnosis of de-
mentia (n = 3), Parkinson disease (n = 4), mood disorders
(n = 3), evidence of brain infarctions on MRI scan (n = 13),
arachnoid cysts (n = 3), or brain tumors (n = 1) were excluded
from the current study, leaving 512 individuals. Blood drawn
after clinical examination was routinely analyzed for RBC fo-
late levels. Of the initial sample that underwent MRI scan, 11
indivudals did not take part in the blood drawing procedure,
leaving 501 participants with available RBC folate values at
baseline, which represent the baseline study population. Com-
pared with the rest of the SNAC-K sample, the MRI sub-
sample was younger (mean [SD] age, 70.9 [9.3] vs 75.4 [11.4]
years; P < .001), had a better Mini-Mental State Examination
total score (mean [SD], 29.1 [1.1] vs 26.8 [6.1]; P < .001), and
higher educational level (mean [SD] years of schooling, 12.2
[4.1] vs 11.8 [4.0]; P = .04). Brain MRI scan was performed at
baseline and thereafter every 3 years for the older cohort (ie,
those ≥78 years at baseline; n = 92 at 3-year follow-up) and ev-
ery 6 years for the whole cohort (n = 260; 53 in the older co-
hort and 207 in the younger cohort). Therefore, 299 partici-
pants had 1 or more MRI scan at follow-up (eAppendix and
eFigure in the Supplement).

Key Points
Question Are vitamin B12, folate, and sulfur amino acids
associated with progressive structural brain changes in older
adults?
Findings In this population-based longitudinal study of 501
elderly individuals without dementia, higher blood levels of
vitamin B12 and holotranscobalamin as well as lower homocysteine
values were associated with a decreased rate of total brain tissue
volume loss. Furthermore, elevated homocysteine values were
associated with progression of white matter hyperintensities
among participants with higher systolic blood pressure.
Meanings Vitamin B12 and homocysteine blood levels are
associated with accelerated brain aging in older adults.

and white matter volume (WMV) were calculated after auto-
matic segmentation of the T1 images in native space using
SPM12bsoftware(StatisticalParametricMapping,http://www
.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/),implementedinMatlab(TheMathworks
Inc), using the unified segmentation approach.22,23 Total brain
tissue (TBT) volume was obtained by adding GMV and WMV.
Total intracranial volume was finally calculated by adding the
volumes of TBT and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Automatic volu-
metricsegmentationofthehippocampuswasperformedusing
theFreesurferimageanalysissuite,version5.0.1(MartinosCen-
ter for Biomedical Imaging, Harvard–Massachusetts Institute

mentations were carefully checked visually. Total brain tissue
volume,GMV,WMV,andhippocampalvolumewereexpressed

and multiplied by 100.
To measure global WMH volumes, all WMHs were manu-
ally drawn on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images by a
single rater (G.K.) and further interpolated on the correspond-
ingT1-weightedimagestocompensateforthegapbetweenslices

divided by TBT volumes before hypothesis testing.
Biochemical Analyses
At baseline, venous blood samples were taken while the par-
ticipant was not fasting and routine analyses, including RBC
folate assessment, were done within 2 hours using chemilu-
minescence microparticle folate binding protein assay at Sab-
batsbergHospital,Stockholm,Sweden(resultsavailablefor501
participants). The coefficient of variation was 4.8% and 6.1%
at 147.4 and 238.4 ng/mL (to convert to nanomoles per liter,
multiplyby2.266),respectively.Specimenswerestoredat–80°
for 10 to 12 years. Batches were transferred thereafter on dry
ice to the University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. Because our study
was a substudy of the larger SNAC-K study, there was suffi-
cientdemandforbloodsamplestobeusedforavarietyofother
biochemical assays, and sufficient serum volumes were not
availablefor31participants.VitaminB12andholoTClevelswere
measured by microbiological methods, as described
previously.9 The coefficient of variation for both assays was
5%. The levels of sulfur amino acids (tHcy, methionine, cys-
tathionine, cysteine, and glutathione) were measured using
tandem mass spectrometry after treatment of serum with a re-
ducing agent, as described previously.25 Interassay coeffi-
cients of variation were between 5% and 10%. One individual
with a tHcy value of 98 μmol/L was excluded. Genotyping of
APOE(OMIM107741)wasperformedasdescribedpreviously.20
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of individuals who participated at fol-
low-up MRI scan were compared with those who did not par-
ticipate using χ2 tests for the proportions and t test or Mann-
Whitneytestforcontinuousvariables,whenappropriate.Linear
mixed models for repeated measures were used to estimate β
(SE)fortheassociationofthelevelsofvitaminB12,holoTC,RBC
folate, and sulfur amino acids with repeated measures of brain
volumes and WMH over 6 years. Models were adjusted for age
andsex(model1),andthenadditionallyforotherpotentialcon-
founding or mediating factors, including educational level,
APOEε4, SBP, creatinine, use of vitamin supplements, smok-
ing, treatment of hypertension, plasma total cholesterol level,
obesity (ie, body mass index ≥30 [calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), history of
cardiovascular conditions (ie, atrial fibrillation, coronary heart
disease, and heart failure), and plasma albumin level (model
2). The interaction between time and each covariate was also
added in all models. In the linear mixed models, the β coeffi-
cient for vitamin B12, folate, and sulfur amino acid values rep-
resent the cross-sectional association with the baseline brain
volume. The β coefficient for the interaction between vita-
min B12, folate or sulfur amino acids and time represents the
effect of these biomarkers on the rate of change in brain vol-
ume per year. A positive β coefficient indicates that an in-
crease in these biomarkers was associated with decreased rate
of brain volume loss over time. For the associations with WMH
and CSF, a positive β coefficient indicates that an increase in
these biomarkers was associated with increased volume of
WMH or CSF.
Analyses were repeated after excluding participants with
low levels of vitamin B12 (<148 pmol/L [n = 6] and <258 pmol/L
[n = 110]),26,27 holoTC (<35 pmol/L [n = 68]),28 and RBC fo-
late (<55.2 ng/mL [n = 46]). All analyses were also repeated af-
ter excluding 30 participants who developed dementia dur-
ing follow-up. We analyzed the data using Stata, version 12
(StataCorp LP).
Results
The 501 study participants were a mean (SD) age of 70.9 (9.1)
years and 300 (59.9%) were women. Selected characteristics
are shown in Table 1 of all participants at baseline and those
who underwent a follow-up MRI scan compared with those
who did not. Individuals who underwent a follow-up MRI scan
were younger at baseline, were more educated, were less likely
to have cardiovascular conditions, and had higher methio-
nine levels compared with those who did not undergo a fol-
low-up MRI scan. In addition, individuals who underwent a
follow-up MRI scan had higher baseline TBT and lower WMH
volume. Mean (SD) TBT volume declined from 74.3% (3.7%)
oftotalintracranialvolumeatbaselineto71.6%(4.1%)at6-year
follow-up (P < .001). In contrast, mean (SD) WMH volume in-
creased from 0.0004% (0.0007%) to 0.0007% (0.0009%) at
6-year follow-up (P < .001).
Vitamin B12, Folate, and Sulfur Amino Acid
Concentrations in Association With Brain Atrophy
Linear mixed models were used to examine the associations
of vitamin B12, holoTC, RBC folate, and sulfur amino acid val-
ues with the rate of loss of brain volume and WMH volume.
There was no cross-sectional association between values for
vitamin B12, holoTC, and brain volumes. In the prospective
analyses over 6 years, higher levels of vitamin B12 and holoTC
were related to a decreased rate of TBT volume loss: for each
1-SD increase, β (SE) was 0.048 (0.013) for vitamin B12 level
(P < .001) and 0.040 (0.13) for holoTC level (P = .002), after ad-

justing for all study covariates (Table 2, model 2). These asso-
ciations remained after excluding the participants who used
vitamin supplements: β (SE) was 0.067 (0.023) for vitamin B12
levels (P = .004) and 0.167 (0.35) for holoTC levels (P < .001).
Furthermore, increased levels of vitamin B12 and holoTC were
associated with less progression in CSF volume and tended to
have an association with decreased loss of WMV. In addition,
increased levels of vitamin B12 had a borderline significant as-
sociation with decreased loss of GMV and loss of hippocam-
pal volume (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
In addition to increased levels of vitamin B12, increasing
age and history of cardiovascular conditions were associated
with loss of TBT volume: β (SE) was –0.008 (0.002) for age
(P < .001) and –0.083 (0.035) for history of cardiovascular con-
ditions (P = .02). The associations of vitamin B12 and holoTC
levels with the rate of loss of TBT volume remained un-
changed when excluding individuals whose levels of vitamin
B12 were less than 148 pmol/L (β [SE], 0.048 [0.013]; P < .001)
or less than 258 pmol/L (β [SE], 0.038 [0.014]; P = .006) or
whose holoTC values were below 35 pmol/L (β [SE], 0.040
[0.013]; P = .002).
After adjusting for age and sex, elevated levels of tHcy had
a significant cross-sectional association with TBT volume (β
[SE], –0.574 (0.142); P < .001 for each 1-SD increase). Addi-
tional adjustment for other study covariates did not influ-
ence the results: β (SE) became –0.601 (0.153) (P < .001)
(Table2).Inthelongitudinalanalysisover6years,levelsoftHcy
were associated with increased rate of loss of TBT volume: β
(SE) was –0.035 (0.015) (P = .02) (Table 2). Further adjust-
ment for estimated glomerular filtration rate did not change
the associations. Increased levels of tHcy were also associ-
ated with higher CSF volume and increased rate of loss of GMV
(eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement). No significant cross-
sectional or longitudinal associations were observed for RBC
folate or other sulfur amino acid values.
Analyseswererepeatedafterexcluding30individualswith
incident dementia at follow-up (eAppendix in the Supple-
ment). After controlling for all study covariates (model 2), lev-
els of tHcy remained associated with a faster rate of loss of TBT
volume over 6 years: β (SE) –0.036 (0.015) (P = .01). In con-
trast, levels of vitamin B12 and holoTC were related to de-
creased rate of loss of TBT volume: β (SE) was 0.045 (0.013)
for vitamin B12 (P = .001) and 0.039 (0.013) for holoTC
(P = .003).
Vitamin B12, Folate, and Sulfur Amino Acid
Concentrations in Association With WMH Volume
No longitudinal associations were found between vitamin B12,
RBC folate, or sulfur amino acid levels and the change in WMH
volume over 6 years in all participants (Table 3). However, lev-
els of tHcy were significantly associated with the progression
of WMH volume among individuals with SBP higher than 140

Discussion
In this longitudinal population-based study of older adults
without dementia, higher levels of vitamin B12 and holoTC as
well as lower levels of tHcy were associated with a decreased
rate of loss of brain volume over 6 years. The observed asso-
ciations were independent of common sociodemographic and
vascular risk factors. The protective effect of vitamin B12 and
holoTC appeared to be present across the whole distribution.
No association between markers of the transsulfuration path-
way and markers of brain aging were observed. This finding
may suggest that markers of the methylation pathway may be
more important than markers of the transsulfuration path-
way in association with brain aging. In addition, elevated lev-
els of tHcy were associated with increased WMH volume, but
only among individuals with higher baseline SBP.
Relatively few longitudinal studies have investigated the
associations of vitamin B12, folate, and sulfur amino acids with
the rate of loss of brain volume. Consistent with our findings,
lower levels of vitamin B12 and holoTC, but not folate or tHcy,
were associated with an increased rate of loss of brain vol-
ume over 5 years in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory
and Aging study.9 Raised baseline levels of tHcy were associ-
ated with a faster rate of atrophy of the medial temporal lobe
in patients with Alzheimer disease,12 and with more rapid at-
rophy of the total brain volume in those with mild cognitive
impairment.13 Rates of brain atrophy were significantly cor-
related with levels of tHcy in the Study on Cognition and Prog-
nosis in the Elderly (follow-up, 2 years),11 but no associations

with levels of folate and vitamin B12 were found.11 In addition,
higher levels of tHcy were associated with the progression of
ventricular enlargement, another surrogate of brain atrophy, in
theSecondManifestationsofARTerialDisease–MagneticReso-
nance (SMART-MR) study (follow-up, 3.9 years).14 Differences
in follow-up periods, vitamin status, and other characteristics
of the study populations can explain some of the discrepan-
cies among the studies.
In our study, increased levels of tHcy were related to WMH
progression among individuals with higher SBP. Hyperten-
sion is a major risk factor for WMH,21 which is thought to re-
flect cerebral small-vessel disease, an important mediator in
the association of hypertension with brain aging.29 Our find-
ings suggest that tHcy concentrations may exacerbate the del-
eterious effect of hypertension on WMH. Similar to our
results, elevated levels of tHcy were associated with the pro-
gression of total WMH volume in the SMART-MR study, which
included participants with symptomatic atherosclerotic
disease.15 However, no associations between levels of tHcy, fo-
late,orvitaminB12andprogressionofwhitematterlesionsover
2 years were observed in the SCOPE study, which included 80
individuals with hypertension.11
High levels of tHcy have been associated with endothe-
lial dysfunction, impaired nitric oxide activity, atherosclero-
sis, and subsequent increase in the risk of various cardiovas-
cular or cerebrovascular events, which may increase the risk
of brain aging and cognitive decline.4,30 Furthermore, el-
evated levels of tHcy may potentiate generation of β-amyloid
peptide and its neurotoxicity or promote formation of neuro-
fibrillary tangles through several mechanisms, which may lead
to increased rate of brain atrophy.4,30,31 Alternatively, the pro-
tective effects of vitamin B12 may be mediated through S-
adenosylmethionine, which is the primary methyl donor in
many biochemical reactions involved in normal brain func-
tions, including the production of cell membrane phospho-
lipids, myelin, monoaminergic neurotransmitters, and nucleic

cognitive decline and dementia.30
Inourstudy,highlevelsoftHcywereassociatedbothcross-
sectionally and longitudinally with loss of TBT volume, sug-
gesting that tHcy may be involved in brain atrophy for a longer
period. In contrast, we did not observe a cross-sectional asso-
ciation with vitamin B12 or holoTC. It may be possible that vi-
tamin B12 needs a longer time to influence brain structure and
that the effects first manifest after several years of follow-up.
OurresultsshowedanassociationbetweenvitaminB12 andho-
loTC across the entire range with TBT volume change over 6
years, suggesting that individuals who are not classically defi-
cient in vitamin B12 but have low-normal levels of vitamin B12
may benefit from vitamin B12 treatment, although this finding
hastobedeterminedinrandomizedclinicaltrials.Aclinicaltrial
(Homocysteine and B Vitamins in Cognitive Impairment) has
shown that B vitamin treatment of individuals with mild cog-
nitive impairment markedly slows whole13 and regional brain
atrophy32 in those with elevated levels of tHcy and normal lev-
els of vitamin B12. Bayesian network analysis32 indicated that
the main factor in this protective effect was vitamin B12. How-
ever, further trial evidence is needed to confirm that vitamin
B12 supplementation will reduce the rate of loss of TBT volume
in older adults with low-normal levels of vitamin B12.27,32
The main strengths of this study are the relatively large
number of community-dwelling older adults with available
data on a large number of potential confounders, the avail-
ability of MRI scans on at least 2 to 3 occasions over 6 years,
and the evaluation of vitamin B12, folate, and sulfur amino acid
levels simultaneously in association with the outcome. In ad-
dition, our results remained unchanged after excluding indi-
viduals with incident dementia. Stability of tHcy, vitamin B12,
and folate in samples stored for a long period at –70°C or more
has been reported previously.33,34
The main limitations of our study include the measure-
ment of levels of vitamin B12, folate, or sulfur amino acids at
only 1 time point, which may underestimate their associa-
tions owing to regression dilution.30 Although participants at
the 6-year follow-up MRI scan were younger and were less
likely to have a history of cardiovascular conditions than did
nonparticipantsinthestudy,theeffectofanynonresponsebias
is to underestimate any associations with vitamin status.35 Se-
lective survival may also have contributed to underestima-
tion of the associations, because low levels of vitamin B12 or
folate and high levels of tHcy have been associated with in-
creased mortality in previous studies.1,4,36
