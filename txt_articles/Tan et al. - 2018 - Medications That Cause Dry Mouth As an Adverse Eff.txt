OBJECTIVES: To assess and quantify the risk of drug-
induced dry mouth as a side effect in older people.
DESIGN: Systematic review and metaanalysis.
SETTING: A search of the literature was undertaken
using Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and
PubMed from 1990 to 2016.
PARTICIPANTS: Older people (aged ≥60) who partici-
pated in intervention or observational studies investigating
drug use as an exposure and xerostomia or salivary gland
hypofunction as adverse drug outcomes.
MEASUREMENTS: Two pairs of authors screened titles
and abstracts of studies for relevance. Two authors inde-
pendently extracted data, including study characteristics,
definitions of exposure and outcome, and methodological
quality. For the metaanalyses, random-effects models were
used for pooling the data and I2 statistics for exploring
heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Of 1,544 potentially relevant studies, 52 were
deemed eligible for inclusion in the final review and 26 in
metaanalyses. The majority of studies were of moderate
methodological quality. In the intervention studies, urolog-
ical medications (odds ratio (OR) = 5.91, 95% confidence
interval
(CI) = 4.04–8.63;
I2 = 62%),
antidepressants
(OR = 4.74, 95% CI = 2.69–8.32, I2 = 21%), and psyc-
holeptics
(OR = 2.59,
95%
CI = 1.79–3.95,
I2 = 0%)
were significantly associated with dry mouth. In the obser-
vational studies, numbers of medications and several medi-
cation classes were significantly associated with xerostomia
and salivary gland hypofunction.
CONCLUSION: Medication use was significantly associ-
ated with xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction in
older adults. The risk of dry mouth was greatest for drugs
used for urinary incontinence. Future research should
develop a risk score for medication-induced dry mouth to
assist with prescribing and medication management. J Am

O
lder adults are high users of medications. It is esti-
mated that 40% of community-dwelling and 75% of
institutionalized older adults take 5 or more medications,
with approximately 10% of older adults taking 10 or
more.1 This high burden of comorbidity and polyphar-
macy put older adults at risk of adverse drug events.
Dry mouth is one of the most common adverse effects
of medication use in older adults.2,3 This includes salivary
gland hypofunction (objectively measured decrease in sali-
vation) and xerostomia (subjective feeling of dry mouth). It
has been shown that the prevalence of hyposalivation
increases with the number of medications used,2 but few
studies have investigated the severity of medication-induced
dry mouth and associated sequelae.3 Adverse effects of sali-
vary gland hypofunction include dental caries, dysgeusia,
oral mucosal soreness, and oral candidiasis.4 The process of
chewing and swallowing may also be affected, and this can
affect the nutritional status of older people.
Drug-induced dry mouth has been attributed to a
range of mechanisms. Although anticholinergic effects
underlie the majority of cases, other mechanisms include
sympathomimetic effects, topical effects of inhaled medica-
tions, dehydration, vasoconstriction in salivary glands,
alterations in electrolyte and fluid balance, and changes in
saliva composition.5
There is strong evidence that certain drug classes cause
dry mouth. A previous systematic review identified particu-
lar drug groups that induce salivary gland hypofunction

systems.4 Examples of drug classes that induce dry mouth
include
antidepressants,
antipsychotics,
anticholinergics,
antihypertensives,

and

but
there is a lack of reviews focusing on elderly adults, even
though they are at greater risk of drug-induced dry mouth.
Additionally, although certain drugs have been found to
be associated with dry mouth, few studies have tried to
quantify the risk.
Objective
The aim of this study was to systematically review the lit-
erature to assess and quantify the risk of drug-induced dry
mouth as a side effect in individuals aged 60 and older.
METHODS
Protocol and Registration
The protocol for this review was registered with the Inter-
national
Prospective
Register
of
Systematic
Reviews
(PROSPERO) (registration number CRD42016040033).
Search Strategy and Information Sources
A literature search was undertaken using Medline, Embase,
Cochrane, Web of Science, and PubMed from 1990 to
2016. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Emtree subject
headings, topics and key words related to dry mouth (xeros-
tomia, asialia, hyposalivation, salivary dysfunction, salivary
flow, salivary secretion, dry mouth), medication use (drugs,
polypharmacy, specific drug classes), older people (aged,
elder, senior, older), and study design (controlled trials,
observational studies) were used. The full search strategy is
included in the supplementary material (Supplementary
Table S1). Searches were limited to English-language arti-
cles and excluded conference abstracts.
Eligibility Criteria
Studies were included in the review if they were original
research published as a scientific peer-reviewed article from
1990 onwards; were intervention studies or observational
studies (case-control studies, cohort studies, before-after
studies and cross-sectional studies, conducted in humans);
included persons aged 60 and older (if studies included
subjects <60, data had to have been extractable for those
≥60; included a group exposed to drugs, including specific
drugs and drug classes or number of drugs; included a
comparator or control group that did not receive drugs or
the drug of interest (studies that involved active compara-
tors or persons who acted as their own controls were eligi-
ble);
and
reported
on
xerostomia,
hyposalivation,
or
salivary gland hypofunction as adverse drug effects, mea-
sured in exposed and unexposed groups.
Study Selection
The titles and abstracts of studies were screened indepen-
dently for relevance by two pairs of authors (ET and GS,
DL and KJ). Full-text copies were obtained if a study
appeared to meet the inclusion criteria or it was unclear
whether it would meet the criteria. Two authors (ET and
DL) independently reviewed the full texts to assess each
study’s suitability for inclusion. Disagreements or uncer-
tainties about study inclusion were resolved by discussion
in the presence of the two other authors (GS and KJ).
Data Extraction and Validity Assessment
Two authors (ET and DL) independently extracted data
using a standardized data abstraction form. Data extracted
included year of publication; study design; country; study
setting; follow-up duration (for dry mouth outcome); study
sample characteristics (age and relevant comorbidities);
sample size; analytical sample size; year of data collection;
definition of drug exposure, including name, dose, dose
form, duration of use, and method used to determine drug
exposure; definition of xerostomia or salivary gland hypo-
function outcome; method used to determine presence of
the outcome; and proportions in exposed and unexposed
groups.
Methodological quality of studies was assessed using
the Jadad score for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)7
and an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
modified for cross-sectional studies.8 For studies reporting
pooled analyses, the original studies were assessed for
quality. If at least one study did not meet a particular
quality criterion, the pooled study was assigned a 0 for
that quality criterion.
Metaanalysis
If 2 or more studies reported a similar drug exposure and
primary outcome measure with appropriate extractable
data, a metaanalysis was undertaken. Metaanalysis was
performed using Review Manager version 5.3 (Nordic
Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen,
Denmark). Random-effects models were used for pooling
the data, and I2 statistics were used to explore heterogene-
ity. The effect size for the metaanalysis was calculated as
odds ratios (ORs) and risk differences (RDs). Significance
was tested using Z-statistics.
RESULTS
Study Selection
The search of electronic databases retrieved 2,591 articles.
After removing duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 1,544
studies
were
reviewed,
of
which
867
were
excluded
because they clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria.
The full-text versions of 677 articles were obtained and
scrutinized, and 624 were excluded after independent
review by at least two authors (Figure 1). A total of 52
studies were included in the final review and are summa-
rized below and in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.
Study Characteristics
Of the included studies, 33 were experimental studies,

Drug Exposure
A wide range of drug treatments was assessed across the
included studies. Experimental studies tested specific drugs,
the most common being those used for urinary frequency
and incontinence (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code

Results of Individual Studies
In the experimental studies, a greater proportion of those
undergoing drug treatment reported xerostomia than of
those receiving placebo. In the cross-sectional studies, med-
ication use, number of medications, and using a wide
range of medication classes were significantly associated
with xerostomia, salivary flow rate, and salivary gland
hypofunction. In studies investigating number of drugs as
the exposure, all except 141 reported a significant associa-
tion between number of drugs and dry mouth in older
people. Main findings are summarized in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2.
Metaanalysis

Statistical
heterogeneity
was
substantial
across the trials assessing drugs used for urinary frequency
and incontinence (I2 = 62%). The main drugs assessed in
this group included tolterodine (n = 4)12,22,29,33 and oxy-
butynin (n = 3).16,19,30 Of the tolterodine studies, 1 inves-
tigated twice-daily administration of the immediate-release
preparation,22
with
the
remainder
assessing
extended-
release formulations. All oxybutynin studies included in
the metaanalysis assessed immediate-release oral prepara-
tions. The metaanalysis found that urological medications
were significantly associated with xerostomia (OR = 5.91,
95% CI = 4.04–8.63; RD = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.13–0.36)
(Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1a). When examining
specific urological drugs, oral immediate-release oxybu-
tynin was associated with the greatest risk of dry mouth
(RD = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.43–0.70), whereas the risk with
mirabegron was negligible (RD = 0.00, 95% CI = �0.01–
0.02). Statistical heterogeneity was low across trials inves-
tigating
antidepressants
(I2 = 21%).
The
main
drug
assessed in this group was duloxetine (n = 4). Antidepres-
sant use was significantly associated with xerostomia
(OR = 4.74,
95%
CI = 2.69–8.32;
RD = 0.09,
95%
CI = 0.04–0.14) (Figure 3, Supplementary
Figure
S1b).
Statistical heterogeneity was low across trials assessing
psycholeptics (I2 = 0%). Psycholeptics were more likely
than
placebo
to
cause
xerostomia
(OR = 2.59,
95%
CI = 1.79–3.95; RD = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.05–0.12) (Fig-
ure 4, Supplementary Figure S1c).
DISCUSSION
Summary of Evidence
Our systematic review found that medication use was sig-
nificantly associated with xerostomia and salivary gland
hypofunction in older individuals. Findings of the meta-
analyses confirm that specific drugs, including those from
therapeutic classes used for urinary incontinence, antide-
pressants, and psycholeptics are significantly associated
with xerostomia. The risk was greatest in drugs used for
urinary incontinence, for which the odds of xerostomia
were almost 6 times as great as with placebo. Methodolog-
ical limitations of current studies were related to sample
selection, randomization, and blinding.
The most common ATC categories associated with
xerostomia were agents acting on the genitourinary and ner-
vous systems, with the most cited drugs being tolterodine (4
studies), duloxetine (4 studies), and oxybutynin (3 studies).
This finding is reflected in a previous review.4 Most of the
drugs used for urinary incontinence are antimuscarinics and
exert dry mouth through this antimuscarinic mechanism.
Oxybutynin, tolterodine, and fesoterodine are nonselective
antimuscarinic agents. Darifenacin and solifenacin are M3-
selective receptor antagonists and may be more bladder-spe-
cific and less prone to causing anticholinergic side effects,
such as dry mouth. Mirabegron, assessed in one study, is a
beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist and an alternative to
antimuscarinic drugs. It is less likely to cause dry mouth,
and this is reflected in our metaanalysis in that it was not
significantly different from placebo.
Our metaanalysis of antidepressants included 3 classes
of antidepressants: duloxetine, a selective serotonin and
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI); escitalopram, a
selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); and doxepin,
a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs enhance the actions
of noradrenaline and serotonin by blocking their reuptake
at the neuronal membrane, but they also block histaminic,
a1-adrenergic,
and
muscarinic
cholinergic
receptors,

 resulting in adverse drug reactions such as dry mouth.2
Although SSRIs and SNRIs can cause dry mouth, they are
generally less likely to cause anticholinergic side effects
than TCAs.2
Several psycholeptic medications, including particular
antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and hypnotics, are also prone
to causing dry mouth.2 Quetiapine, an atypical antipsy-
chotic, works through antagonism at D2 receptors in the
mesolimbic pathway and 5HT2A receptors in the frontal
cortex. Quetiapine also has a strong affinity for histamin-
ergic and a1-adrenergic receptors, which may be responsi-
ble for dry mouth. Eszopiclone, a nonbenzodiazepine

 hypnotic, interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-ben-
zodiazepine receptor complex. The most common adverse
effect of eszopiclone is unpleasant taste, although it may
also produce dry mouth.
There were considerable differences in the magnitude
of the likelihood of xerostomia between different drug
classes. This is probably because of variations in the mech-
anism of actions between and within drug classes. The
greatest likelihood of xerostomia was seen with drugs used
for
urinary
frequency
and
incontinence
(G04BD)
(OR = 5.91), which is probably related to their antimus-
carinic properties. This was equivalent to a 25% greater
absolute risk of dry mouth and is clinically significant
given that 1 in 4 individuals treated with a urological med-
ication developed dry mouth. Orally administered immedi-
ate-release oxybutynin was associated with the greatest
risk of dry mouth (56% absolute risk increase) of the
drugs in the same therapeutic class. The second largest

 likelihood
was
seen
with
antidepressants
(N06A)
(OR = 4.74), which mainly consisted of antidepressants
with fewer anticholinergic side effects. Lastly, the psyc-
holeptics (N05) in our metaanalysis had the lowest likeli-
hood of causing xerostomia (OR = 1.60), because they
were newer agents with more selective receptor activity.
Antidepressants and psycholeptics were associated with a
9% greater absolute risk of dry mouth, indicating that, for
every 11 people treated, one would experience drug-
induced dry mouth.
In our systematic review, a significant association was
found between number of drugs and dry mouth in older
people. These findings reflect the results of previous studies
conducted in the general population and highlight the link
between polypharmacy and dry mouth.60
To our knowledge, this is the first review to quantify
the risk of medication-associated dry mouth in persons
aged 60 and older. The odds ratio of xerostomia as a side
effect of xerostomic drugs in our study would be expected
to be higher than in younger individuals because salivary
production declines with aging.61 A Swedish study also
reported a greater prevalence of xerostomia with older age
in nonmedicated adults,60 but there have been few other
metaanalyses assessing the risk of dry mouth as a medica-
tion side effect in elderly adults.
Limitations
This systematic review and metaanalysis has some limita-
tions. Although broad search strategies were implemented
in a range of databases to ensure that all relevant studies
were
included,
unpublished
and
non-English-language
studies were not sought. Thus, the possibility of publica-
tion bias cannot be excluded. We limited the search from
1990 to 2016, so currently used medications with a strong
association with dry mouth that were researched before
this time were excluded. Common examples include older
TCAs, potent diuretics, antihistamines, and various drugs
acting on the central nervous system
Dry mouth is usually not a primary outcome of experi-
mental studies; hence our search may have missed certain
studies that did not report dry mouth as an adverse out-
come in the title or abstract. Heterogeneity in the defini-
tions and methods used to assess dry mouth across studies
may have affected the ability to compare findings and draw
conclusions. Xerostomia is a subjective phenomenon, and
different people may have experienced and reported xeros-
tomia differently. Currently, there is no criterion standard
method of assessing xerostomia. There may have been dif-
ferences in medication exposure between studies. Treat-
ment dose, duration, and formulation were not assessed in
this review. It is likely that these factors influence the sever-
ity of medication-induced xerostomia.3 For ease of classifi-
cation, we categorized drugs according to ATC codes, but
inclusion of different drugs in each group, some of which
may have different indications, may have differing effects
on xerostomia. Most of the cross-sectional studies used
self-reported drug use, which may underestimate total drug
use. Additionally, the way drugs were classified into partic-
ular groups may have varied between studies. We addressed
potential heterogeneity in sample characteristics and treat-
ment effects in our metaanalyses by using random-effects
models. Some included studies were of low methodological
quality, and thus their findings should be interpreted with
caution. Our systematic review included fewer studies than
previous similar reviews,4 which probably reflects our stric-
ter inclusion criteria, including restricting the population to
older people and the years of publication.
Implications
This review has implications for practitioners treating and
managing older adults using drugs. Practitioners should
carefully weigh the benefits of therapy against the potential
risk of dry mouth, oral complications, and treatment discon-
tinuation. This is particularly important in people with
polypharmacy. Medications should be regularly monitored
and reviewed to identify potential oral side effects of medi-
cations, and dose adjustment or change of therapy should be
considered when needed. Based on the quantified risk, risk
scores can be developed that may be a useful guide for prac-
titioners not only in identifying individuals at risk of dry
mouth, but also in evaluating the risk grade for dental
health. This can provide information on how much the risk
of dental complications is for elderly adults and aid in the
development and implementation of preventive programs
and comprehensive therapy plans. Future studies should be
conducted to develop risk scores for dental health based on
the use of different drug groups and numbers of drugs used.
Additional factors such as dose, duration, and formulation
of treatment should also be considered. The major conse-
quences of medication-induced xerostomia, such as the
development of dental caries and need for clinical interven-
tion, should also be explored in future research.
CONCLUSION
Our systematic review found that medication use was sig-
nificantly associated with xerostomia and salivary gland
hypofunction in older individuals. Findings of the meta-
analyses show that the risk of xerostomia was greatest for
drugs used for urinary incontinence, followed by antide-
