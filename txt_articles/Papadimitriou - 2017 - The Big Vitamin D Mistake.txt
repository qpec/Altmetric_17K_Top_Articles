Perspective 
Since 2006, type 1 diabetes in Finland has plateaued and then decreased after the authorities’ decision to fortify dietary milk products 
with cholecalciferol. The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recom-
mended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medi-
cine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 
6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conduct-
ed of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and 
associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin 
D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to 
consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe up-
per tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 
IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereaf-
ter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been doubling 
every 20 years. In Finland, the recommendation for daily vita-
min D supplementation was gradually reduced from 4000-
5000 IU in 1964 to 400 IU in 1992. Concomitantly, T1D in-
creased by 350% in those aged 1-4 years, 100% in those aged 
5-9 years, and 50% in those aged 10-14 years [1]. However,

since 2006, T1D has plateaued and decreased after an increase 
in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) after the authorities’ 
decision to fortify all dietary milk products with cholecalciferol 
[2]. Moreover, the worldwide association of ultraviolet (UV)-B 
light and vitamin D status with T1D and multiple sclerosis is 
now more than evident.
MAIN BODY
Vitamin D and Immunomodulation
The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is 
critical. It has been shown that the redirection of human auto-
reactive T-cells upon interaction with dendritic cells can be 
modulated by an analog of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [3]. In a 
recent plenary session entitled “Cell Therapy in Type 1 Diabe-
tes” that closed the 2016 meeting of the European Society for 
 279
The Big Vitamin D Mistake
Paediatric Endocrinology in Paris, Bart O. Roep [3] announced 
the initiation of phase 1 clinical trials in humans in 2016 with 
the following protocol: dendritic cells will be isolated from the 
patient’s peripheral blood, cultured with calcitriol, and then 
re-injected in an abdominal intradermal position to ‘teach’ the 
rest of the immune cells not to attack β-cells anymore. In a 
large birth cohort study, T1D incidence was reduced by 78% 
with 2000 IU of cholecalciferol per day [4]. Moreover, T1D au-
toantibodies can be “negativated” with oral calcitriol [5]. Vita-
min D levels >100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL with a conversion factor 
of ×2.5) improve insulin secretion [6] and prevent β-cell de-
struction by suppressing macrophage adhesion and migration 
through downregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and 
scavenger receptor-A1 [7]. 
The Statistical Error in the Estimation of the  
Recommended Dietary Allowance of Vitamin D
Veugelers and Ekwaru [8], in a correct reanalysis of the data 
used by the Institute of Medicine, proved that 8895 IU/d are 
needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/
L. Heaney et al. [9] confirmed that finding, reporting that 6201 
IU/d were needed to achieve the Endocrine Society’s recom-
mendation of 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/day to reach 100 nmol/L.
What Serum Vitamin D Levels Should We Aim 
for?
Garland et al. [10] published the largest meta-analysis ever 
conducted of all studies published between January 1, 1966 
and January 15, 2013 dealing with all-cause mortality related 
to serum 25(OH)D, showing that 25(OH)D levels <75 nmol/L 
may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause 
mortality, demolishing the U-shape curve of vitamin D levels 
and mortality that had been assumed until then. 
Call to Public Health Authorities
Since all-disease (autoimmune diseases, metabolic syn-
drome, type 2 diabetes, cancer) mortality risk is reduced to 1.0 
with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L [10], we call all re-
sponsible public health authorities to consider designating as 
the recommended dietary allowance (i.e., the average daily 
level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of 
nearly all healthy people, presuming minimal sun exposure) 
intake levels corresponding to those proposed by the Endo-
crine Society Expert Committee (2011) as safe upper tolerable 
daily intake doses for patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency 
(<50 nmol/L): 2000 IU for those <1 year of age, 4000 IU for 
those aged 1-18 years, and 10 000 IU for those aged >18 years.
Since 10 000 IU/d is needed to achieve 100 nmol/L [9], ex-
cept for individuals with vitamin D hypersensitivity, and since 
there is no evidence of adverse effects associated with serum 
25(OH)D levels <140 nmol/L, leaving a considerable margin 
of safety for efforts to raise the population-wide concentration 
to around 100 nmol/L, the doses we propose could be used to 
reach the level of 75 nmol/L or preferably 100 nmol/L. Of 
course, these recommended doses can be individualized 
based on dietary and sun exposure habits and the latitude of 
the country, and they can also be adjusted according to body 
mass index, age, and skin color, with obese, elderly, and dark-
skinned people needing higher doses.
Explanation of the Pandemic of Vitamin D 
Deficiency
Only 20% of our vitamin D reserve is meant to come from 
the diet. The remaining 80% is expected to be produced in our 
skin from the UV-B of the sun. In contrast to the context of the 
recommendations of the 1960s of 4000 to 5000 IU/d to avoid 
rickets, our diet today is poor in wild fish (×10 richer in vita-
min D), wild eggs, and fresh milk. Children are playing and 
people are working indoors all day long, and powerful sun-
protective cosmetics are used to prevent melanoma. Even 
sunny countries such as Greece present a high prevalence of 
vitamin D deficiency, as the angle of the sun rays from autumn 
to spring do not result in sufficient vitamin D production with 
usual sun exposure.
Optimal Vitamin D Supplementation
With the target for vitamin D set at 100 nmol/L, the dose, 
frequency, and duration of supplementation will be important 
factors for healthy subjects committed to optimizing their nu-
tritional status. Since in the case of vitamin D, serum levels de-
pend on dietary intake (20%) and sun exposure (80%), a prac-
tical approach would be to recommend at least the three-
fourths of the upper tolerable dose proposed by the Endocrine 
Society to be taken as a supplement all year long except for 
circumstances such as vacations in which one engages in sun-
bathing. This could translate to, for instance, 1000 IU for chil-
dren <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for those older 
than 6 months who are breastfed, 3000 IU for children >1 year 
of age, and up to 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter, with 
non-pediatric doses adapted to the body mass index with the

target set to 100 nmol/L instead of 50 nmol/L. More impor-
tantly, according to the Endocrine Society’s clinical practice 
guidelines, doses up to 1000 IU/d for infants up to 6 months, 
1500 IU/d for infants from 6 months to 1 year, 2500 IU/d for 
children aged 1-3 years, 3000 IU/d for children aged 4-8 years, 
and 4000 IU/d for everyone over 8 years can be given safely 
without medical supervision just to prevent vitamin D defi-
ciency, while higher doses may be needed to correct hypovi-
taminosis D.
Importance of Vitamin D Supplementation
Such a strategy relies on adequate supplementation among 
pregnant and lactating women, and on timely supplementa-
tion of every newborn before seroconversion towards autoim-
mune targets occurs. The benefits for individuals’ general 
health status, apart from the obvious gains in skeletal health, 
cannot be fully foreseen, but may very well be surprisingly 
greater than expected given the impact of vitamin D deficien-
cy on metabolic syndrome itself. Improvements in vitamin D 
status may help reduce the public health burden of metabolic 
syndrome and of potential subsequent health conditions, in-
cluding type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSION
Unfortunately, medicine took a very long time to realize that 
vitamin D is not simply a vitamin that prevents rickets. For that 
purpose, 400-600 IU/d may be enough. However, we know to-
day that vitamin D is a powerful nuclear receptor-activating 
hormone of critical importance, especially to the immune sys-
tem. With the available data mentioned above, the proposed 
doses would probably suffice to maintain vitamin D levels 
around or over 75-100 nmol/L, with practically zero risk of tox-
icity. Undeniably, further studies are needed to clarify the opti-
mal supplementation of vitamin D, although it is uncertain 
whether a universal recommended dietary allowance is feasi-
ble. Meanwhile, actions are urgently needed to protect the 
global population from the threats posed by vitamin D defi-
ciency.
