The conversion of the b-amyloid (Ab) peptide into pathogenic aggregates is linked to the onset and progression of
Alzheimer’s disease. Although this observation has prompted an extensive search for therapeutic agents to
modulate the concentration of Ab or inhibit its aggregation, all clinical trials with these objectives have so far failed,
at least in part because of a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of aggre-
gation and its inhibition. To address this problem, we describe a chemical kinetics approach for rational drug dis-
covery, in which the effects of small molecules on the rates of specific microscopic steps in the self-assembly of Ab42,
the most aggregation-prone variant of Ab, are analyzed quantitatively. By applying this approach, we report that
bexarotene, an anticancer drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, selectively targets the primary
nucleation step in Ab42 aggregation, delays the formation of toxic species in neuroblastoma cells, and completely
suppresses Ab42 deposition and its consequences in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Ab42-mediated toxicity.
These results suggest that the prevention of the primary nucleation of Ab42 by compounds such as bexarotene could
potentially reduce the risk of onset of Alzheimer’s disease and, more generally, that our strategy provides a general
framework for the rational identification of a range of candidate drugs directed against neurodegenerative disorders.
INTRODUCTION
The incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing rapidly as the
global population ages. It is estimated that 44 million people currently
suffer from AD and that this number will exceed 135 million by 2050
(1). AD is one of more than 40 related disorders (2) characterized by the
misfolding of soluble proteins and their subsequent conversion into am-
yloid fibrils (3–9).
A key molecular pathway that underlies AD involves the aggregation
of Ab42, the 42-residue form of the b-amyloid (Ab) peptide, which is a
fragment produced by the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor
protein (3–5, 8, 9). Ab42 is an intrinsically disordered peptide (10) that
self-assembles into fibrillar aggregates observed in the brains of AD pa-
tients (5, 9). Inhibiting the self-assembly of Ab42 has, therefore, emerged
as a major potential therapeutic strategy against AD (11–20), although
no small molecule designed to achieve this effect has yet shown clinical
efficacy (21). Such clinical failures are caused at least in part by the
incomplete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
generation of toxic species and of the processes by which small mole-
cules are able to interfere with the aggregation pathway of Ab42. In ad-
dition, it is increasingly evident that prefibrillar oligomeric species, rather
than mature amyloid fibrils and plaques, represent the main pathogenic
agents in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions (3, 22–27). Ac-
cordingly, effective therapeutic strategies are unlikely to consist of a non-
specific suppression of Ab42 fibril formation but involve the targeting
of specific species in a controlled intervention at precise microscopic
steps during the complex aggregation process of Ab42 (28).
A therapeutic strategy of this type can now be proposed by exploiting
recent major advances in our understanding of the molecular processes
underlying amyloid formation. These advances are the result of the in-
novative application of chemical kinetics to the study of protein aggre-
gation (29, 30). The availability of highly reproducible data obtained
from kinetic measurements based on thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence
(31) has recently allowed us to define the Ab42 aggregation mechanism
in terms of its underlying molecular events (30). We observed that
once a small but critical concentration of Ab42 aggregates has been
generated through primary nucleation of monomers, surface-catalyzed
secondary nucleation becomes the dominant process, whereby the sur-
faces of the fibrils once formed serve as catalytic sites for the genera-
tion of toxic oligomeric species (30). These oligomers can then grow
and convert into additional fibrils, thus further promoting the forma-
tion of additional toxic species in a highly effective catalytic cycle (30).
These results can now be taken further as they offer the possibility
of investigating the mechanism of inhibition of the Ab42 aggregation
process by therapeutic molecules (28, 29, 32). Approaches using chem-
ical kinetics, which do not require prior knowledge of the elusive struc-
tures of the toxic species and are not limited by the need for very tight
binding of small molecules to the aggregation-prone proteins, provide
highly sensitive methods for the quantitative detection of the effects of
potential therapeutic molecules on the aggregation process. By adopting
this strategy, we show here that bexarotene, which is an anticancer drug
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), selectively

the formation of toxic species in neuroblastoma cells, and completely
suppresses Ab aggregation and its consequence in a Caenorhabditis
elegans model of Ab-mediated toxicity.
RESULTS
Chemical kinetics-based therapeutic strategies allow to
combat Ab aggregation
The drug discovery strategy that we describe in this work to target
the aggregation of Ab42 consists of four main steps (Fig. 1). First, a
fragment-based approach is applied to identify small molecules that
could interfere with Ab aggregation (Fig. 1, step 1). Fragment-based
drug design approaches are based on the screening of a limited num-
ber of small molecules to identify fragments with low binding affi-
nities, typically with KD values in the high micromolar to millimolar
range (33, 34). When combined together, some of these fragments
result in molecules containing multiple favorable interactions that
bind more tightly than the initial fragments to the target of interest.
To implement this strategy, we generated a set of 164 fragments de-
rived from 88 compounds reported in the literature to interact with
Ab. These fragments were then screened for chemically related
compounds in four small-molecule databases (ChEMBL, PubChem,
ZINC, and DrugBank), resulting in the identification of 16,850 mo-
lecules. This fragment-based library contains 386 FDA-approved
drugs, which have the potential to be effective candidates for pre-
clinical lead development. Indeed, such an approach offers exciting
opportunities to repurpose existing licensed therapeutic compounds
for use in AD with the benefit of providing a more rapid route to the
clinic than through novel drug discovery approaches (35, 36).
To test this strategy, we selected two compounds from this library
with different chemical scaffolds, bexarotene and tramiprosate (Fig. 1,
step 1). Tramiprosate, which has been unsuccessful in phase 3 AD clin-
ical trials (identifier: NCT0088673), was reported in preclinical develop-
ment to bind soluble Ab species, to maintain them in a nonfibrillar
form, to decrease Ab-induced neurotoxicity, and to reduce amyloid pla-
ques and cerebral levels of Ab in mice (37). By contrast, bexarotene is
still in phase 2 AD clinical trials (identifier: NCT01782742). This small
molecule is a retinoid X receptor agonist approved by the FDA for the
treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and has shown an ability to
restore cognitive function to some degree in AD (38–44). Although this
activity has been reported to be associated with an enhancement of apo-
lipoprotein E levels, and thus of Ab42 clearance, conflicting reports have
been published and the detailed mechanism of action remains uncertain
(38–44). Indeed, this molecule has also been reported to compete with
cholesterol for binding to Ab42, thus inhibiting its cholesterol-induced
oligomerization (45).
The next step in our general strategy is to apply chemical kinetics to
elucidate the mechanism of aggregation of the protein of interest (Fig. 1,
step 2). In the specific case of Ab42, as mentioned in the Introduction,
we have recently provided a comprehensive description of the mecha-
nism (32). The kinetic analysis is then repeated in the presence of
selected compounds to identify the microscopic events that are specifi-
cally inhibited and hence to define the species with which the compound
interacts (Fig. 1, step 3). Indeed, a potential drug candidate could bind
to monomers, oligomers, or fibril surface or ends, and therefore dif-
ferent microscopic steps could be affected. Sequestration of monomers
could result in a decrease in the rates of all microscopic events shown
in Fig. 1 (that is, kn for primary nucleation, k2 for secondary nuclea-
tion, and k+ for elongation), whereas sequestering oligomers is
expected to affect kn and k2. On the other hand, targeting fibrils could
decrease either k+ or k2 depending on whether inhibitors bind to fibril
ends or surfaces, respectively (28).
Finally, we evaluate the observed effect of the molecules on the for-
mation of toxic species in vivo (Fig. 1, step 4). The inhibition of specific
microscopic steps in Ab42 aggregation is expected to have different
effects on the generation of toxic oligomers (28). More specifically,
inhibiting primary nucleation will strongly delay the aggregation reac-
tion and should not affect the total load of toxic oligomers generated
during the reaction. However, an increase or a decrease in the number
of toxic oligomers is anticipated to be the result of the suppression of
either elongation or secondary nucleation, respectively (28). These two
latter processes represent interchangeable pathways as inhibiting elon-
gation is expected to redirect the aggregation reaction toward secondary
nucleation, which will consequently increase the number of toxic oligo-
mers, and vice versa (28).
Bexarotene, but not tramiprosate, delays
Ab42 fibril formation
To investigate the effects of the two small molecules selected for this
study on the individual microscopic steps underlying the aggregation
process of Ab42, we carried out a global analysis of the aggregation
profiles acquired at different concentrations of both Ab42 and each
of the two compounds in turn (Fig. 2). We monitored Ab42 fibril for-
mation in vitro in the absence and in the presence of tramiprosate and
of bexarotene using a highly reproducible ThT-based protocol described
previously (31). Unlike earlier reports (37), we observed no effects of
tramiprosate on Ab42 aggregation even when present in 20-fold excess
(Fig. 2A and fig. S1A). By contrast, we observed a progressive delay in
Ab42 aggregation with increasing concentrations of bexarotene (Fig. 2,
B and C, and fig. S1B). The scaling of the half-times in such reaction
profiles as a function of the total protein concentration follows a power
law whose exponent contains important information about the micro-
scopic events underlying the macroscopic aggregation behavior (32). In
the presence of bexarotene, although the lag times of the aggregation
reaction increase as the concentration is increased, the scaling exponent
remains unaffected. This result suggests that, under these conditions,
bexarotene delays the aggregation reaction by inhibiting primary nucle-
ation but does not affect the relative contributions of primary and
secondary nucleation to the overall aggregation reaction.
These experiments show that the effect of bexarotene on Ab42 ag-
gregation is substantial. The addition of a fourfold excess of bexarotene
to a 2 mM sample of Ab42 increased the time to half-completion of
the aggregation reaction compared to that of Ab42 alone by a factor
of 2 (that is, 2.30 ± 0.02 hours for Ab42 alone and 4.50 ± 0.06 hours
for Ab42 in the presence of bexarotene) (Fig. 3A). To further probe
this effect, and to exclude any possible interference of bexarotene on
ThT binding to Ab42 fibrils and hence on the resulting fluorescence,
we monitored fibril formation under conditions where ThT was not
present by removing aliquots of solution at a series of different time
points and measuring the extent of fibril formation using atomic
force microscopy (AFM) and immunochemistry (Fig. 3, B to D).
Fractions were collected throughout the entire reaction to monitor
the events during the three phases of Ab42 aggregation (that is, lag,
growth, and saturation) as completely as possible. AFM images show

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the drug discovery strategy described in this work. The strategy consists of four steps: (1) A fragment-based
approach that allows the identification of small molecules that interact with the aggregation-prone system, here Ab42, including FDA-approved
molecules for drug repurposing. (2) An in vitro kinetic analysis that identifies the specific molecular steps in the Ab42 aggregation mechanism
responsible for the generation of toxic species. (3) A further kinetic analysis to determine the mechanism of inhibition associated with the mo-
lecules identified in step 1. (4) An evaluation of the effects of these molecules on the formation of toxic species in vivo. In particular, the inhibition
of primary nucleation is predicted to delay the aggregation without affecting the total number of oligomers generated by the aggregation pro-
cess, whereas inhibiting elongation or secondary nucleation is predicted either to increase or to decrease the number of toxic oligomers, respectively
(see text).

 that after 2.1 hours, fibrillar structures are visible in the absence of
bexarotene but not in its presence, thus providing independent evidence
for a bexarotene-induced delay of fibril formation (Fig. 3B). These
results were extended (Fig. 3C) by probing the quantities of Ab42 at
nine different time points during the aggregation using either sequence-
sensitive W0-2 or fibril-sensitive OC primary antibodies (see Materials
and Methods). W0-2 antibodies recognize the sequence spanning resi-
dues 4 to 10 (that is, the N terminus) that is not likely to be involved
in the hydrophobic core of any aggregated species and thus bind to all
types of Ab species. W0-2 antibodies indicated the presence of similar
quantities of Ab42 at the different time points during its aggregation
reaction (Fig. 3C, upper panel), whereas fibril-specific OC antibodies
that recognize only fibrillar species (Fig. 3C, lower panel) showed,
in agreement with the kinetic analysis and the AFM images, a delay
of 2 hours in the time required for half-completion of the aggrega-
tion process.
We further probed the quantity of Ab42 converted into fibrils by
comparing the intensities of the dots to a dot-blot assay that was per-
formed on a range of concentrations between 4 and 0.1 mM Ab42 fi-
brils using the OC fibril antibodies (Fig. 3D). Fibrils were collected
after incubation for 3 hours of a freshly prepared 4 mM solution of
monomeric Ab42 (Fig. 3D, lower panel), and then the solution was
diluted to yield 12 samples with concentrations ranging from 4 to
0.1 mM (Fig. 3D, lower panel). Analysis of the dot-blot data indicated
that the quantities of fibrils formed at the reaction half-times of the
2 mM Ab42 sample in the absence and in the presence of bexarotene
(Fig. 3C, lower panel, time points 6 and 7) were indeed closely simi-
lar to those formed during the aggregation reaction of an Ab42 sam-
ple of 1 mM concentration, consistent with no interference from ThT
on the aggregation reaction (Fig. 3D, lower panel).
Bexarotene specifically inhibits the primary nucleation of
Ab42 aggregation
We then carried out a quantitative analysis of the effects of bexarotene
by matching the aggregation profiles on the basis of the rate laws
derived from a master equation that relates the macroscopic time evo-
lution of the quantity of fibrils to the rate constants of the different
microscopic events (28, 29). In this approach, the aggregation profiles
in the presence of the inhibitor are described by introducing into the
rate laws suitable perturbations to each of the microscopic rate con-
stants evaluated in the absence of the inhibitor. The modifications of
the rate constants required to describe the aggregation profiles in the
presence of different inhibitor concentrations are then indicative of
the specific process affected by the presence of the compound. The
aggregation profiles of 5 mM Ab42 in the presence of concentrations
of bexarotene in the range of 5 to 25 mM show that the experimental
data are extremely well described when the primary nucleation rate
constant, kn, is specifically decreased. By contrast, the experimental
data are not consistent with predictions made by altering the rate con-
stants of secondary nucleation or of elongation, k2 and k+, respectively
(Fig. 4, A to C). The data therefore reveal that, under these conditions,
bexarotene specifically modifies the primary nucleation pathway (that
is, knk+) with no (or very little) detectable effect on secondary path-
ways in the aggregation reaction (that is, k2k+) (Fig. 4D). Similar
results were obtained at different Ab42 concentrations (fig. S2).
To further strengthen these conclusions, we carried out an addi-
tional series of measurements of the aggregation kinetics of Ab42 un-
der conditions where the primary nucleation step was bypassed by the
introduction of preformed fibrils (that is, seeds) to the reaction mix-
ture. In such a situation, the contribution of primary nucleation to the
reaction kinetics is negligible, as the conversion of soluble peptide into
mature fibrils is greatly accelerated by secondary nucleation and elon-
gation reactions promoted by the seeds (22). In the presence of 10%
fibril seeds, where elongation of the preformed fibril seeds is the dom-
inant mechanism, no effect was observed on the aggregation kinetics
of 2 mM Ab42 even at a 10-fold excess of bexarotene (Fig. 4E), whereas
the corresponding aggregation process under unseeded conditions was
completely inhibited for 15 hours (fig. S2A). Furthermore, we also
measured the aggregation kinetics of a 2 mM sample of Ab42 in the
presence of 5% of preformed fibril seeds. Under these conditions,
primary nucleation is completely bypassed, whereas both surface-
catalyzed secondary nucleation and elongation significantly contribute
to the overall kinetics (Fig. 4F). These experiments show a concentration-
dependent bexarotene-induced delay that corresponds to a decrease in
the rate of surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation (Fig. 4, G and H).
These findings show that, although the elongation of fibrils is essen-
tially unaffected by bexarotene, this compound has a large and highly
selective effect on the nucleation of Ab42, with the effect being more
selective toward primary rather than secondary nucleation.
The observation that bexarotene inhibits Ab42 aggregation by spe-
cifically perturbing both primary and secondary nucleation could, in
principle, result from the interaction of bexarotene with Ab42 mono-

 mers, with primary and secondary oligomers, or indeed with both
monomers and oligomers (Fig. 4F). However, binding to monomers
would affect the rates of all the microscopic steps in the overall reac-
tion under the conditions studied here (28), enabling us to conclude
that bexarotene specifically interacts primarily with Ab42 oligomers.
This conclusion is further supported by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy measurements, where no significant perturba-
tions of the chemical shifts could be observed in the heteronuclear
single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra of 25 mM 15N-labeled
monomeric Ab42 before and after the addition of a fivefold excess of
bexarotene, indicating that binding to the monomeric form of Ab42 is
likely to be negligible (figs. S3 and S4). Furthermore, these findings
provide novel insights into the structural features of primary and
secondary oligomers of Ab42, suggesting that primary and secondary

 nuclei may have similar structural features, and hence can interact
with bexarotene in a similar manner, and that the same residues of
Ab42 may be involved in both primary and secondary nucleation
events.
Targeting primary nucleation delays the formation of
toxic species of Ab42
We next explored whether the delay in Ab42 fibril formation result-
ing from inhibiting primary nucleation by bexarotene could be asso-
ciated with a delay in the formation of neurotoxic species, as the
perturbation of different microscopic steps in Ab42 aggregation has
different effects on the rate of generation of toxic oligomers (28).
Thus, for example, decreasing the primary nucleation rate is expected
to delay the overall aggregation reaction but not to affect the total
number of toxic oligomers generated during the reaction (28). An in-
crease or decrease in the number of toxic oligomers is, however, likely
to result from the suppression of elongation or secondary nucleation,
respectively (28).
To examine this issue, we performed numerical simulations of the
total rate of formation of oligomers, from both primary and secondary
processes in the aggregation reaction of a 0.5 mM solution of Ab42 in
the absence and presence of a 20-fold excess of bexarotene (see Mate-
rials and Methods). Because bexarotene preferentially targets primary
nucleation, it is expected to delay the entire aggregation process, that
is, to delay the generation of toxic species without necessarily decreas-
ing the amount of the toxic species. On the basis of our previous find-
ings, primary nucleation is a very rapid process that is directly bypassed
by secondary nucleation once a small but critical concentration of seeds
has been formed (22). We have therefore used the lowest concentration
of Ab42 at which aggregation can be observed (31) and monitored its
aggregation in the presence of high concentrations of bexarotene to in-
hibit the primary nucleation step as strongly as possible. The simula-
tions show that by delaying the primary nucleation of Ab42 in the
presence of bexarotene, a delay in the formation of Ab42 oligomers
occurs but without decreasing the total amount of oligomers formed
over the time course of the aggregation process (Fig. 5, A and B). In-
deed, the formation of oligomers follows a parabolic evolution in that
the number of oligomers formed during the aggregation of Ab42
alone starts to decrease at the point where the number in the presence
of bexarotene started to increase.
To verify these predictions, we measured the cytotoxicity in human
neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) resulting from the aggregation of
0.5 mM Ab42 in the absence and presence of a 20-fold excess (that is,
10 mM) of bexarotene by evaluating the levels of caspase-3, an early marker
of apoptosis (see Materials and Methods). Indeed, caspase-9 is an ini-
tiator enzyme that mediates apoptotic pathways after mitochondrial

absence or in the presence of a 1:1 or 5:1 concentration ratio of bexarotene to Ab42 (represented by different colors). The solid lines show predictions
for the resulting reaction profiles when secondary nucleation (A), fibril elongation (B), or primary nucleation (C) is inhibited by bexarotene. Only the
prediction for the case where primary nucleation alone is inhibited closely fits the experimental data. (D) Evolution of the apparent reaction rate constants
with increasing concentration ratios of bexarotene (kn is the rate of primary nucleation, k+ is the rate of elongation, and k2 is the rate of secondary
nucleation; K represents in each case either knk+ or k2k+). Note the significant decrease in primary pathways, knk+, when compared to secondary pathways,
k2k+, as the concentration of bexarotene is increased. (E) Kinetic profiles of 2 mM Ab42 without (blue) and with the addition of 10% of preformed seed
fibrils in the absence or in the presence of a 2-, 5-, 7-, and 10-fold excess of bexarotene (represented by different colors). Note the rapid increase in
the slope of the aggregation reaction in the presence of preformed seed fibrils compared to that of the reaction without the addition of preformed fibrils.

 damage and activates effector caspases, such as caspase-3, by
cleaving their inactive proforms and initiating the apoptotic cas-
cade. Staurosporine, which is a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor
known to activate the apoptosis pathway, was used as a positive
control (see Materials and Methods). Aliquots of Ab42 solutions
were removed at different time points during the lag phase of the
aggregation reaction in the absence and presence of bexarotene and
incubated with SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. In its monomeric
form (before incubation, Fig. 5C), Ab42 showed no detectable tox-
icity irrespective of the presence of bexarotene. In the absence of
bexarotene, the species formed after incubation for 0.3 hours
(Fig. 5D) and 4 hours (Fig. 5E) exhibited a level of toxicity 65 ±
5% higher than that in the presence of bexarotene. However, for
the samples incubated for 7 hours, the level of toxicity generated
in the presence of bexarotene increased to a value similar to that
observed in its absence whereas the toxicity of Ab alone decreased.
This further supports a bexarotene-induced delay of the formation
of Ab42 toxic species in cell (Fig. 5F).
Bexarotene rescues Ab42-mediated dysfunction
in C. elegans models
We further evaluated the effects of bexarotene on the formation of
toxic Ab42 species in a C. elegans model of Ab42-mediated dysfunc-
tion, denoted GMC101 (termed the Ab worm model) (46), and com-
pared the resulting effects of the addition of bexarotene to those
observed in a control worm model, CL2122, which is free of Ab42
(see Materials and Methods). In the GMC101 model, Ab42 is
expressed in body wall muscle cells where it forms aggregates and
results in severe age-progressive paralysis (46). We exposed the worms
to increasing concentrations of bexarotene ranging from 5 to 10 mM
and measured the frequency of body bends, which is indicative of the
state of the muscle cells, and also the quantity of Ab42 aggregates
within the body of the worms (Fig. 6) (see Materials and Methods).
In the absence of bexarotene, the frequency of the body bends of the
Ab worm model decreased significantly after just 2 days compared to
the situation in the control worm model where a similar decrease in
the motility was observed only after 9 days (Fig. 6B). In agreement

(A) and nucleation rates (B) for a solution of 0.5 mM Ab42 in the absence and presence of a 20-fold excess of bexarotene. Blue lines correspond to a control
aggregation reaction in the absence of bexarotene, with reaction rate constants k2 = 1 × 106 M−2 s−1, k+ = 3 × 106 M−1 s−1, and kn = 1 × 104 M−1 s−1.
Dotted red lines show the behavior in the presence of bexarotene, where the nucleation rate constant, kn, has been decreased to 1 × 102 1 M−1 s−1.
A delay in the evolution of the total nucleation rate (that is, of both primary and secondary nucleation) is observed. (C to F) Levels of activated

the aggregation reaction at 0 hour (C), 0.3 hour (D), 4 hours (E), and 7 hours (F). A.U., arbitrary units. Percentage differences between the flu-
orescence values of Ab42 in the absence or in the presence of bexarotene (gray circles). These results show that detectable quantities of toxic
Ab42 species are formed in the presence of bexarotene only after 7 hours of incubation at 37°C, in agreement with a bexarotene delay of the
formation of Ab42 toxic species.

 with such a difference, the levels of aggregates monitored using the
fluorescence intensity of the amyloid-specific dye NIAD-4 (47) differ
significantly between the two models, with essentially no aggregates
being detected on the same day the worms reached adulthood in
the Ab worm model in the presence of bexarotene (Fig. 6, C and D).
We then explored the effect of increasing concentrations of
bexarotene added at the larval stages of the C. elegans life cycle
(Fig. 6A) and observed a concentration-dependent maintenance of
the motility of the Ab worm model. Indeed, the motility of the Ab
worms was maintained completely upon addition of 10 mM bexarotene
in two bursts at the L1 and L4 larval stages, that is, reached the level
observed in the control worms (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, imaging
studies (see Materials and Methods) showed that the addition of
10 mM bexarotene to the Ab worms suppressed the formation of Ab42
fibrils for 9 days of adulthood (Fig. 6D). The level of Ab42 expression
in the Ab worms in the absence and in the presence of bexarotene was
found to be closely similar (Fig. 6E). This result indicates that main-
taining the level of motility in the Ab worms could be achieved by
preventing the aggregation of Ab42 by bexarotene. In accord with this
conclusion, the addition of bexarotene did not show any effects in the
control worm model (fig. S5A). The normal motility observed for the
Ab worms in the presence of bexarotene could be consistent with two
distinct scenarios. One possibility could be a strong delay in primary
nucleation, which would substantially delay the aggregation of Ab42
and hence maintain the motility of the Ab worms to values similar to
those of the control worms. Alternatively, these results could arise from
a combination of effects on primary and secondary nucleation. This
latter possibility is particularly relevant because although bexarotene
preferentially inhibits primary nucleation, it could also affect sec-
ondary nucleation when present in excess. Indeed, our experiments

 using 5% seeds show that bexarotene is capable of acting on surface-
catalyzed secondary nucleation as well as on primary nucleation (Fig.
4, F to H). Furthermore, we also observed that adding bexarotene only
at day 2 did not show any detectable effect on the motility of the Ab
worms (fig. S5, B and C), suggesting that the finding from the in vitro
studies that bexarotene specifically affects nucleation events in Ab42
aggregation is also the case in vivo.
DISCUSSION
We have described a drug discovery strategy that aims at targeting
Ab42 aggregation with small molecules. This strategy involves the
identification of compounds from an Ab-specific fragment-based
library and the subsequent application of chemical kinetics for gaining
a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanism of inhibi-
tion (Fig. 1). We have found that although tramiprosate has no effect
on Ab42 aggregation, bexarotene interferes selectively with the earliest
stage of Ab42 aggregation by reducing the rate of primary nucleation.
We have also observed that this effect significantly inhibits the rate
of the overall aggregation reaction not only in vitro but also in cells
and in vivo, as bexarotene was found to suppress the formation of
toxic species both in cells and in C. elegans. Furthermore, we have shown
that a sufficient concentration of bexarotene given at the earliest stages
of the C. elegans life cycle can maintain the motility of the worms
expressing Ab42 at a level comparable to those in which Ab42 is not
expressed, thus further supporting the preventive effect of this mole-
cule (48–50).
We anticipate that the strategy that we have described in this paper
will enable the identification of further compounds capable of
inhibiting Ab42 aggregation and the definition of the specific micro-
scopic steps affected by each compound (that is, primary or secondary
nucleation or elongation). These results should enable a range of
compounds to be identified to control and modulate the onset of ag-
gregation and the rate of its progression first in vitro and then in vivo.
In addition, the results described in the present work indicate that
bexarotene and other inhibitors of primary nucleation have the
potential to be efficient means of delaying aggregation by reducing
the probability that primary nuclei are formed and proliferate, such
that our natural protection mechanisms could remain effective to
more advanced ages. Indeed, we draw an analogy between the
strategy presented here and that of using statins, which reduce the
level of cholesterol and thus the risk of heart conditions, and suggest
that such molecules could effectively act as “neurostatins.” In addi-
tion to the use of molecules such as bexarotene for preventive
purposes, it is possible to speculate that targeting secondary nuclea-
tion, which is largely responsible for the production of toxic species
(30), would form the basis to developing treatments to reduce the
rate of progression of AD.
CONCLUSIONS
We have described in this study the development and application of
a comprehensive strategy for the identification of potent anti-AD
drugs. This strategy is based on understanding the molecular details
of the inhibition processes, creating opportunities to identify effective
therapeutic agents in a rational manner that could eventually lead to
successful drugs to combat AD. Finally, given the generality of the
phenomenon of protein aggregation, the present strategy offers a
framework for the rational design and evaluation of novel therapeutics
to target other forms of neurodegenerative disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of Ab peptides
TherecombinantAb (M1-42)peptide(MDAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFF
AEDVGSNKGA IIGLMVGGVV IA), here called Ab42, was expressed
in the Escherichia coli BL21 Gold (DE3) strain (Stratagene) and purified
as described previously with slight modifications (51). Briefly, the pu-
rification procedure involved sonication of E. coli cells, dissolution of
inclusion bodies in 8 M urea, ion exchange in batch mode on diethyl-
aminoethyl cellulose resin, and lyophilization. The lyophilized fractions
were further purified using a Superdex 75 HR 26/60 column (GE Health-
care), and eluates were analyzed using SDS–polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis for the presence of the desired protein product. The fractions
containing the recombinant protein were combined, frozen using liquid
nitrogen, and lyophilized again.
Isotopically labeled 15N-Ab42 was prepared by growing transformed
E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) strain (Stratagene) in 1-liter flasks at 37°C
with 500 ml of minimal M9 batch medium. Briefly, a 20-ml preculture
grown overnight to saturation in LB medium containing ampicilin
(100 mg/liter) was diluted 1:25 in 2YT medium supplemented with
ampicilin (100 mg/liter) and grown at 37°C. When the optical density
at 600 nm reached 0.5, the cells were harvested, washed in minimal
medium, and inoculated in one-quarter of the initial culture volume of
minimal M9 medium containing ampicilin (100 mg/liter) and supple-
mented with 15NH4Cl (2 g/liter) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Cells
were grown at 37°C for 2 hours before induction. Isopropyl-b-D-thioga-
lactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and
cells were grown at 37°C overnight. Purification of 15N-Ab42 was per-
formed as described above. Chemicals, including bexarotene and tra-
miprosate, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were of the highest
purity available.
Preparation of samples for kinetic experiments
Solutions of monomeric peptides were prepared by dissolving the
lyophilized Ab42 peptide in 6 M GuHCl. Monomeric forms were
purified from potential oligomeric species and salt using a Superdex
75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min
and were eluted in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) supplemen-
ted with 200 mM EDTA and 0.02% NaN3. The center of the peak was
collected, and the peptide concentration was determined from the ab-
sorbance of the integrated peak area using e280 = 1400 liter mol−1 cm−1.
The obtained monomer was diluted with buffer to the desired concen-
tration and supplemented with 20 mM ThT from a 1 mM stock. All
samples were prepared in low-binding Eppendorf tubes on ice using
careful pipetting to avoid introduction of air bubbles. Each sample
was then pipetted into multiple wells of a 96-well half-area, low-binding
polyethylene glycol coating plate (Corning 3881) with a clear bottom,
at 80 ml per well.
For the seeded experiments, preformed fibrils were prepared just
before the experiment. Kinetic experiments were set up just as above
for a 4 mM Ab42 sample in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8)
with 200 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, and 20 mM ThT. The ThT fluores-
cence was monitored for 3 hours to verify the formation of fibrils.
Samples were then collected from the wells into low-binding tubes

 and sonicated for 2 min in a sonicator bath at room temperature. Under
the conditions used here (4 mM Ab42), the monomer concentration is
negligible at equilibrium (31). The final concentration of fibrils, in mono-
mer equivalents, was considered equal to the initial concentration of the
monomer. Fibrils were then added to the freshly prepared monomer to
reach either 5 or 10% final concentration of fibrils.
In all cases, bexarotene was first solubilized in 100% dimethyl sulf-
oxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 5 mM and then diluted in the
peptide solution to reach a final DMSO concentration of maximum
1%. We verified that the addition of 1% DMSO in the reaction mix-
ture has no effect on Ab42 aggregation (fig. S6).
Kinetic assays
Assays were initiated by placing the 96-well plate at 37°C under qui-
escent conditions in a plate reader (Fluostar Omega, Fluostar Optima,
or Fluostar Galaxy; BMG Labtech). The ThT fluorescence was
measured through the bottom of the plate with a 440-nm excitation
filter and a 480-nm emission filter. The ThT fluorescence was followed
for three repeats of each sample.

where the kinetic parameters B±, C±, k, k∞, and k

two combinations of the microscopic rate constants k+k2 and knk2,
where kn, k+, and k2 are the primary nucleation, elongation, and
secondary nucleation rate constants, respectively.
Bexarotene can interfere with the aggregation process by inhibiting
one or more of the individual microscopic reactions. We can identify
the microscopic events that are inhibited by the chemical compound
by applying the above equation to describe the macroscopic aggre-
gation profiles shown in Fig. 4 and fig. S2 and comparing the set of
microscopic rate constants k+k2 and knk2 required to describe the time
evolution of the fibril formation in the absence and presence of bex-
arotene. As shown in Fig. 4 and fig. S2, in unseeded aggregation reac-
tions, the presence of the chemical compound mainly perturbs the
primary nucleation rate.
The numerical simulations reported in Fig. 5 (A and B) show the
reaction profiles in the presence and absence of bexarotene simulated
according to Eq. 1. The time evolution of the nucleation rate, r(t), was
simulated according to the equation
rðtÞ ¼ k2MðtÞmðtÞ2 þ knmðtÞ2
ð2Þ
Model simulations in Fig. 4F were performed by fixing the k+ and
k2 parameters for a 2 mM Ab42 solution seeded with 5% of preformed
seed fibrils. The kn parameter was then decreased to very negligible
values (~0). This showed insignificant perturbation to the reaction
profile when the primary nucleation process does not occur.
AFM imaging
Ab42 samples were removed from the aggregation reaction and were
directly deposited onto freshly cleaved mica surfaces and allowed to
dry for 30 min. Samples were then washed with Milli-Q water and
then dried with nitrogen. AFM images were acquired using a VEECO
Dimension 3100 atomic force microscope (Bruker) and JPK Nanowizard
software. The instrument was operated in tapping mode in air using
n-type silicon cantilevers with resonant frequencies between 65 and
130 kHz.
Dot-blot assay
Blotting was performed using either Ab42 fibril-specific antibody
(OC, Millipore) or Ab42 sequence-specific antibody (W0-2, Millipore).
During the time course of the aggregation of 2 mM Ab42 in the absence
and in the presence of fourfold excess of bexarotene (Fig. 3), 4- and 2-ml
Ab42 aliquots were removed from the mixture at different time points
for blotting with either OC or W0-2, respectively. Ab42 aliquots were
spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 mm; Whatman), and then
the membranes were dried and then blocked with Blocking One (Na-
calai Tesque) before immunodetection. OC and W0-2 were used accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were subsequently added,
and fluorescence detection was performed using Typhoon Trio Imager
(GE Healthcare). DMSO-solubilized bexarotene was added to Ab42
with a final concentration of 1% DMSO. For the calibration curve
(Fig. 3D), a series of dilutions between 4 and 0.1 mM were performed
on freshly prepared Ab42 fibrils and 4-ml aliquots were deposited onto
the same nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 mm; Whatman) as the one used
for OC fibril-specific antibody. An oligomer-specific A11 antibody was
also used to detect the evolution of the formation of Ab42 oligomers in
the absence and in the presence of bexarotene. However, under these
conditions, we could not detect oligomers because of their very low
concentration during Ab42 aggregation even when depositing on the
membrane volumes as high as 20 ml.
NMR experiments
For NMR analyses, 15N-Ab42 was purified as described above except
that the buffer of the gel filtration was 50 mM ammonium acetate
(pH 8.5). Lyophilized powder of 15N-Ab42 was dissolved at an ap-
proximate concentration of 1 mM in 0.2% (v/v) ammonium solution
and then collected and stored in aliquots at −80°C until use. NMR sam-
ples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized powder in 20 mM
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 25 mM
containing 10% (v/v) 2H2O in the presence and absence of a fivefold
excess of bexarotene in 2.5% DMSO. The pH of the mixture was
checked for possible pH variations that could occur from the addition
of bexarotene and was found to be unchanged. NMR spectral mea-
surements were made on a Bruker AVANCE-500 spectrometer equipped
with a cryogenic probe. The probe temperature was set to 278 K.
1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at a 1H observation frequency
of 500 MHz with 128 (t1) × 1024 (t2) complex points and 32 scans per
t1 increment. The spectral width was 1216 Hz for the 15N dimension
and 6010 Hz for the 1H dimension. Chemical shift perturbation (CSP)
and intensity changes were monitored using 1H-15N HSQC spectra at
increasing molar ratios of bexarotene to monomeric Ab42. A reference
sample of DMSO without compound was also titrated into Ab42 sam-
ples. CSP and intensity ratio due to the addition of DMSO was sub-
tracted from those observed during titrations with compound. CSP was
calculated as Dd = ((DdN/5)2 + (DdH)2)1/2. NMR spectra were processed
by TopSpin 2.1 (Bruker). Resonance assignment and intensity calcula-
tions were performed using the program Sparky (www.cgl.ucsf.edu/
home/sparky/). The sample preparation protocol and the low NMR
probe temperature (5°C) were chosen to ensure that the Ab42 peptide

 remained monomeric during the entire data acquisition. The HSQC
spectra are typical of intrinsically disordered peptides with a very low
dispersion of resonant frequencies (figs. S3 and S4).
Caspase-3 cytotoxicity assay
Ab42 oligomers are known to be toxic to cells leading to apoptosis
and to cellular death. Cytotoxicity assays were performed by measur-
ing the activity of caspase-3, an earlier marker of apoptosis, in a
neuroblastoma cell line when incubated with Ab42 either in the pres-
ence or in the absence of bexarotene (52). SH-SY5Y human neuro-
blastoma cells were cultured under standard conditions, at 37°C in
a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at a density
of 25,000 per well in a white-walled, clear-bottomed 96-well plate and
cultured for 24 hours in minimum essential medium–F12 (1:1)/10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). The culture medium was then re-
placed with prewarmed phenol red–free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium without FBS into which the peptide samples or NaPO4 buffer
were diluted 1:1. Ab samples at roughly 0.5 mM, either alone or in the
presence of 20-fold excess of bexarotene in 1% DMSO final concentra-
tion, were removed from an ongoing aggregation reaction at different
time points (0, 0.3, 4, and 7 hours) and were followed in parallel by
means of ThT fluorescence. The aggregation reaction was set up as
above except for the buffer from which NaN3 was removed because
of its toxicity. At 10 mM, DMSO-solubilized bexarotene did not show
any toxicity and thus was comparable to the control values (fig. S7).
All the specified time points correspond to Ab42 in the lag phase to
monitor inhibition at the early stage of the aggregation. We used one
separate plate for eachtime point with 25 replicatesof Ab either alone or
in the presence of bexarotene. The cells were cultured in the presence of
the peptides, buffer, and media for an additional 24 hours before the
cytotoxic effect was measured. Cell medium diluted with the same
buffer that was used in these experiments was included in some wells
to evaluate the intrinsic fluorescence of the media and bexarotene.
As a negative control, we added to the cells the cell media diluted
with the buffer that was used to prepare bexarotene (phosphate buf-
fer with 1% DMSO). For the positive control, staurosporine (1 mM)
was added to the cells for 2 hours. Caspase-3/7 activity was measured
using the Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay (Promega). The
fluorogenic caspase-3/7 substrate rhodamine 110 bis-(N-CBZ-L-aspartyl-
L-glutamyl-L-valyl-aspartic acid amide) was diluted 1:100 in the lysis
buffer provided and added to the cell medium at a 1:1 ratio. The fluores-
cence was measured at an excitation of 480 nm and an emission of
520 nm in an Optima Fluostar plate reader. In each of the used plates,
the toxicity was assessed according to a negative and a positive control.
For comparative purposes between different plates, we normalized
the fluorescence values using a parabolic equation (y = axb), which
correspondsto the evolutionof the oligomersasa function of time.Neg-
ative and positive controls were set to 1 and 10, respectively. According
to these calculations, the toxicity of Ab42 in the absence and in the pres-
ence of bexarotene has normalized values between 1 and 10 and hence
could be compared between different plates. Statistical analyses were
performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. Results are expressed as means ±
SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using Student t test or one-way
analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.
C. elegans experiments
Standard conditions were used for C. elegans propagation at 20°C
(53). Briefly, animals were synchronized by hypochlorite bleaching,
hatched overnight in M9 buffer, and subsequently cultured on nem-
atode growth medium (NGM; USP agar) plates seeded with the E. coli
strain OP50. Saturated cultures of OP50 were grown by inoculating
50 ml of LB medium with OP50 and incubating the culture for 16 hours
at 37°C. NGM plates were seeded with bacteria by adding 350 ml of
saturated OP50 to each plate and leaving the plates at room tempera-
ture for 2 to 3 days. On day 3 after synchronization, animals were
placed on NGM plates containing 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (75 mM,
unless stated otherwise) to inhibit growth of offspring.
The following strains were used: dvIs100[unc-54p::A-beta-1-42::unc-
54 3′UTR + mtl-2p::GFP] (GMC101). mtl-2p::GFP produces constitu-
tive expression of GFP in intestinal cells. unc-54p::A-beta-1-42 expresses
full-length human Ab42 peptide in body wall muscle cells that aggre-
gates in vivo. Shifting L4 or young adult animals from 20° to 25°C
causes paralysis (46). dvIs15[pPD30.38 (unc-54 vector) + mtl-2::GFP
(pCL26)] (CL2122) is the control strain for GMC101 (46). C. elegans
var. Bristol (N2) was isolated from the mushroom compost near Bristol,
England. Generation time is about 3 days and mean brood size is about
350 progeny (53).
Bexarotene stock (5 mM in 100% DMSO) was used at an appro-
priate concentration to seed 9-cm NGM plates. Plates were placed in a
laminar flow hood at room temperature (22°C) for 1 hour to dry.
C. elegans cultures were transferred onto media with compound as L1
larvae for 64 to 72 hours at 20°C. Cultures were then transferred to
freshly seeded 9-cm plates as young adults and incubated at 23° or
25°C for the whole experiment. Experiments were carried out at differ-
ent bexarotene concentrations ranging from 5 to 10 mM in 1% DMSO.
As controls, plates seeded only with 1% DMSO were used.
C. elegans motility assay
All populations were cultured at 20°C and developmentally synchro-
nized from a 4-hour egg lay. At 64 to 72 hours after egg lay (time 0),
individuals were shifted to 23° or 25°C, and body movement was as-
sessed over time as indicated. At different ages, animals were washed
out of the plates with M9 and spread over an unseeded 6-cm plate,
after which their movements were recorded at 30 frames per second
using a homemade microscopic setup, at ×0.75 magnification, for 30 s
or 1 min. Two hundred animals were counted per experiment un-
less stated otherwise. All experiments were carried out in triplicate
and the data from one representative experiment are shown. Statis-
tical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software
(GraphPad Software).
Videos were elaborated using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MA), and body bends were quantified using the wrMTrck
plug-in (www.phage.dk/plugins/wrmtrck.html), developed by Jesper
Søndergaard Pedersen.
Staining and microscopy in living C. elegans
Live transgenic animals were incubated with NIAD-4 over a range of
concentrations and times, and it was empirically determined that in-
cubation of living animals with 1 mM NIAD-4 (0.1% DMSO in M9
buffer) for 4 hours at room temperature gave robust and reproducible
staining. After staining, animals were allowed to recover on NGM
plates for about 24 hours to allow destaining via normal metabolism.
Stained animals were mounted on 2% agarose pads containing 40 mM
NaN3 as anesthetic on glass microscope slides for imaging. Images
were captured with a Zeiss Axio Observer D1 fluorescence microscope
(Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH) with a 20× objective and a 49004

tensity was calculated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health) and then normalized as the corrected total cell fluorescence.
Only the head region was considered because of the high background
signal in the guts. All experiments were carried out in triplicate, and
the data from one representative experiment are shown. Statistical sig-
nificance was determined using t tests.
Western blot analysis
For comparison of the Ab42 expression level in the absence and in
the presence of bexarotene, ~3000 adults were collected in S-basal
(53) in triplicate and then frozen in liquid N2. Samples were then
extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mM tris (pH 8),
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 1% NP-40, 1 mM phenyl-
methylsulfonyl fluoride, Roche Complete inhibitors 1×; Roche Holding
AG], disrupted via sonication, and then centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for
10 min at 4°C. Pellets and supernatants were then separated. Pellets
were solubilized using urea/SDS buffer (8 M urea, 2% SDS, 50 mM tris).
Samples at the appropriate concentration were added to NuPAGE LDS
Sample Buffer (1×) and NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent (1×) (Life
Technologies) and heated at 70°C for 10 min. Material was resolved
via NuPAGE Novex 4 to 12% Bis-Tris Protein Gels (Life Technologies),
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using an iBlot Dry Blotting Sys-
tem (Life Technologies), and blocked overnight at 4°C in 5% bovine
serum albumin. Membranes were then probed at room temperature
with MABN10 anti-Ab antibody, clone W0-2 (Millipore) diluted to
1:500. Blots were reprobed with anti–a-tubulin, clone B-5-1-2 (Sigma-
Aldrich) diluted to 1:5000, to standardize total protein loading. Alexa
488–conjugated secondary antibody was used for detection.
