n 2002, Belgium legalized euthanasia, 
defined as the intentional ending of life by a 
physician at the patient’s explicit request.1,2 
For a patient to be eligible for euthanasia, cer-
tain formal criteria for due care must be met.1 
These include a voluntary, well-considered, 
repeated and written request, expressed by a 
person with full mental capacity who is fully 
informed about his or her medical condition and 
the remaining therapeutic possibilities.1 The per-
son must be in a state of constant and unbear-
able physical or mental suffering that cannot be 
alleviated. Due care criteria for the procedure 
include an a priori consultation with a second 
independent physician, consultation with a third 
physician in cases where death is not expected 
in the foreseeable future and a posteriori report-
ing of the case for evaluation purposes.1
To safeguard due process and legal compli-
ance and to enable societal control and evalua-
tion, a mandatory notification procedure was built 
into the legislation.3 Physicians are required to 
report each case of euthanasia to the multidisci-
plinary Belgian Federal Control and Evaluation 
Committee on Euthanasia by completing and 
submitting a registration form within 4 working 
days after a death by euthanasia.1,3 The evaluation 
committee reviews the form and determines 
whether euthanasia was performed in accordance 
with the legal requirements. Initially, only 
anonym 
ous information is reviewed; where there 
is doubt about legality, the committee can revoke 
anonymity by majority decision and can ask the 
reporting phys 
ician for additional information. If 
the committee is of the opinion, based on a two-
thirds majority, that the legal requirements were 
not fulfilled, the case is sent to the public pro-
secutor.1,3 Although not mentioned in the Belgian 
law, physician-assisted suicide is treated as a 
form of euthanasia by the committee.4

Research
Background: In 2002, the Belgian Act on Eutha-
nasia came into effect, regulating the inten-
tional ending of life by a physician at the 
patient’s explicit request. We undertook this 
study to describe trends in officially reported 
euthanasia cases in Belgium with regard to 
patients’ sociodemographic and clinical profiles, 
as well as decision-making and performance 
characteristics.
Methods: We used the database of all eutha-
nasia cases reported to the Federal Control and 
Evaluation Committee on Euthanasia in Belgium 
between Jan. 1, 2003, and Dec. 31, 2013 (n = 
8752). The committee collected these data with 
a standardized registration form. We analyzed 
trends in patient, decision-making and perfor-
mance characteristics using a χ2 technique. We 
also compared and analyzed trends for cases 
reported in Dutch and in French.
Results: The number of reported euthanasia 
cases increased every year, from 235 (0.2% of all 
deaths) in 2003 to 1807 (1.7% of all deaths) in 
2013. The rate of euthanasia increased signifi-
cantly among those aged 80 years or older, 
those who died in a nursing home, those with a 
disease other than cancer and those not 
expected to die in the near future (p < 0.001 for 
all increases). Reported cases in 2013 most often 
concerned those with cancer (68.7%) and those 
under 80 years (65.0%). Palliative care teams 
were increasingly often consulted about eutha-
nasia requests, beyond the legal requirements to 
do so (p < 0.001). Among cases reported in 
Dutch, the proportion in which the person was 
expected to die in the foreseeable future 
decreased from 93.9% in 2003 to 84.1% in 2013, 
and palliative care teams were increasingly con-
sulted about the euthanasia request (from 
34.0% in 2003 to 42.6% in 2013). These trends 
were not significant for cases reported in French.
Interpretation: Since legalization of euthanasia 
in Belgium, the number of reported cases has 
increased each year. Most of those receiving 
euthanasia were younger than 80 years and 
were dying of cancer. Given the increases 
observed among non–terminally ill and older 
patients, this analysis shows the importance of 
detailed monitoring of developments in eutha-
nasia practice.

CMAJ, November 1, 2016, 188(16) 
To facilitate societal control, the Federal 
Control and Evaluation Committee on Eutha-
nasia is legally required to issue biennial 
reports of all reported cases,1,3–9 providing basic 
statistics, an evaluation of the law and further 
recommendations. However, these statistics do 
not provide an overview of long-term trends. A 
more complete and thorough evaluation of case 
characteristics and analysis of trends is needed. 
In this way, adherence to the legal criteria can 
be evaluated, and developments in euthanasia 
practice that might raise concerns can be identi-
fied and addressed.
Belgium has 2 main language communities: 
those who speak Dutch (roughly 60% of the 
population), who mainly live in Flanders, and 
those who speak French (about 40%), who 
mainly live in Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital 
Region is officially bilingual, but predominantly 
French-speaking. Several empirical studies have 
found differences in end-of-life practices, knowl-
edge and attitudes between the regions and 
language communities, showing that Dutch-
speaking physicians more often receive and 
grant euthanasia requests and are more inclined 
to adhere to legal safeguards.10–14 The reports 
issued by the Federal Control and Evaluation 
Committee on Euthanasia show a striking dis-
parity in euthanasia reporting between the 2 lan-
guage communities.4–9 Trends in the characteris-
tics of reported cases and differences among 
them have not yet been studied.
The committee’s reports have shown a con-
tinuing increase in the number of euthanasia 
cases.4–9 The primary objective of this study 
was to examine changes in the number and 
incidence of euthanasia cases and the propor-
tion of euthanasia cases relative to all deaths in 
Belgium up to and including 2013. The sec-
ondary objectives were to determine and report 
the socio 
demographic and clinical characteris-
tics of patients, the decision-making and per-
formance characteristics of reported cases and 
the differences in trends in characteristics 
between cases reported in Dutch and cases 
reported in French. 
Methods
Data source and extraction of data
We obtained the data presented here from the 
database of officially reported euthanasia cases 
in Belgium, made available to us by the Federal 
Control and Evaluation Committee on Eutha-
nasia. This database contains information rou-
tinely collected from the official standardized 
euthanasia registration forms submitted by the 
reporting physicians (see Appendix 1, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.160202/-/DC1, for the English version of 
the registration form [authors’ translation]). 
Physicians are contacted by the committee 
when important information is missing.
We studied all reported cases of euthanasia 
that occurred between Jan. 1, 2003, and Dec. 
31, 2013. Data for euthanasia cases reported in 
2014 and 2015 were not included because the 
committee’s summary report for those years 
had not yet been published. The data are col-
lected for evaluation and control purposes, and 
the Belgian euthanasia law allows for these data 
to be made available, on an anonymous basis, 
for academic research purposes, upon reason-
able request to the committee.1 
The registration form was developed by the 
Federal Control and Evaluation Committee on 
Euthanasia and consists of 2 parts.1,3 The first 
part is confidential and includes the identities of 
the patient, the attending physician and any 
consultant physicians. The committee may not 
use this part of the document for evaluation but 
may decide, by majority, to revoke anonymity 
and contact the physician for further informa-
tion in case of irregularities. The second part 
contains specifications about the age, sex and 
diagnosis of the person receiving euthanasia, 
the type of and reasons for the request, the 
place and date of death, and the euthanasia pro-
cedure followed. The committee uses this part 
to determine whether the performance of eutha-
nasia was in accordance with the conditions and 
procedures stipulated by law. Further details 
about the registration form and its items have 
been described elsewhere.3
The registration form contains both open-
ended and closed-ended questions with pre-
structured response categories. In the database 
we received, the open-ended questions had 
been encoded into categories by the committee. 
We checked the data for coding quality and, if 
necessary, recoded to obtain consistency over 
the years in coding of variables. Inconsistencies 
in the data were checked and clarified with the 
committee.
Statistical analysis
Trends in demographic, clinical and decision-
making characteristics were tested using χ2 
linear-by-linear association statistics to calculate 
bivariable p values. All analyses were performed 
using SPSS software, version 23.0.
Ethics approval
Ethics approval is not required for the second-
ary use of the anonymous data in the database 
of officially reported euthanasia cases.

Results
Between Jan. 1, 2003, and Dec. 31, 2013, a 
total of 8752 euthanasia cases were reported 
(Figure 1). The number increased yearly from 
235 in 2003 (0.2% of all deaths in that year) to 
1807 cases in 2013 (1.7% of all deaths) (Table 
1). The proportion of cases of euthanasia 
among all deaths rose in all patient subgroups 
and was consistently highest among those with 
cancer, patients younger than 80 years of age 
and those dying at home.
Between 2003 and 2013, the proportion of 
cases involving patients aged 80 years or older 
increased from 17.0% to 35.0% (p < 0.001), 
while the proportion of cases involving those 
aged 18 to 59 decreased from 34.5% to 16.5% 
(p < 0.001) (Table 2). An increasing proportion 
of euthanasia cases involved people in a nursing 
home (from 5.1% to 12.1%, p < 0.001) and 
people with a diagnosis other than cancer (from 
15.7% to 31.3%, p < 0.001), while there were 
decreases in the proportion of cases involving 
those dying in hospital (from 52.3% to 42.6%, 
p < 0.001) and those with a diagnosis of cancer 
(from 84.3% to 68.7%, p < 0.001). The propor-
tion of euthanasia cases among those who were 
expected to die in the foreseeable future 
decreased from 91.9% to 85.3% (p < 0.001). An 
increasing proportion of reported cases involved 
people with diagnosis of a neuropsychiatric dis-
order (from 0.8% to 3.9%, p < 0.001).

Over the study period, general practitioners 
were consulted increasingly often as the second 
physician (from 34.9% to 52.4%, p < 0.001) 
and disease and organ specialists less often 
(from 46.0% to 36.6%, p < 0.001) (Table 3). 
The proportion of cases in which an additional 
phys 
ician was consulted, beyond the legal 
requirements for consultation, decreased from 
37.9% to 25.0% (p < 0.001), whereas the pro-
portion of cases in which at least one palliative 
care team was consulted about the request 
increased from 33.9% to 39.3% (p = 0.001). 
The use of barbiturates by intravenous adminis-
tration for euthanasia increased significantly, 
from 80.0% to 98.7% of cases (p < 0.001).
Most euthanasia cases were reported in Dutch; 
the yearly proportion ranged between 79.3% and 
87.1% of all reported cases over the study period, 
with a significant decrease over time, from 84.3% 
in 2003 to 80.5% in 2013 (p = 0.007) (data not 
shown). In 2013, euthanasia cases reported in 
French, relative to those reported in Dutch, more 
often occurred in hospital (52.1% v. 40.3%, p < 
0.001) and less often at home (38.0% v. 45.8%,

*Data for 2002 were excluded from analysis because the euthanasia law came into force on Sept. 23, 2002,15 and data for 2002 thus represent less than an entire 
year. A total of 24 cases were reported from Sept. 23 to Dec. 31, 2002.
†Based on χ2 linear-by-linear association statistics.
‡Euthanasia based on an advance euthanasia directive is allowed only if the person is in an irreversible coma.
§The attending physician must consult a second, independent physician about the serious and incurable character of the disorder. Information about this aspect is 
ascertained by an open-ended question on the registration form.
¶Belgian law distinguishes between persons who are expected to die in the foreseeable future and those who are not expected to die in the foreseeable future. 
For the latter, a third physician must be consulted. The third physician should be either a psychiatrist or a specialist in the patient’s illness.
**Data on whether palliative care teams were consulted and on the drugs used to perform euthanasia were available for only 56 of the 235 cases in 2003.
††Palliative care consultation is not legally required; however, palliative care teams may be consulted about euthanasia requests, beyond the legal requirements 
to do so.
‡‡Other drugs included midazolam, morphine and other drugs used to induce unconsciousness.

p = 0.009). Among cases reported in French, 
patients were more often expected to die in the 
foreseeable future than among cases reported in 
Dutch (90.1% v. 84.1%, p = 0.004), physical suf-
fering was more often accompanied by psycho-
logic suffering (77.0% v. 66.4%, p < 0.001), and 
palliative care teams were less often consulted 
about the request (25.8% v. 42.6%, p < 0.001) 
(data not shown).
Trends in prognosis and in consultation with 
palliative care teams about the euthanasia 
request differed between cases reported in 
Dutch and in French (data not shown). Among 
cases reported in Dutch, the proportion in 
which the person was expected to die in the 
foreseeable future decreased significantly, from 
93.9% in 2003 to 84.1% in 2013, and Dutch-
speaking physicians increasingly consulted pal-
liative care teams about the euthanasia request 
(34.0% of cases in 2003 and 42.6% in 2013). 
These trends were not significant for cases 
reported in French.
Interpretation
Based on data collected by the Belgian Federal 
Control and Evaluation Committee on Eutha-
nasia, this study provides insight into trends in 
the highly debated practice of euthanasia in Bel-
gium. Adding to the data from cross-sectional 
surveys on Belgian euthanasia practice,16–20 the 
current study provides year-by-year time trends 
from a population-based perspective for all 
euthanasia cases officially reported since imple-
mentation of the Belgian euthanasia law in 2002. 
In contrast, recent studies on euthanasia in Bel-
gium have been limited to Flanders, the northern 
Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. In addition, the 
current study examines differences in time trends 
in the reporting of euthanasia between Dutch- 
and French-speaking phys 
icians. 
Our analyses showed that the number of offi-
cially reported euthanasia cases increased each 
year (from 235 in 2003 to 1807 in 2013), in both 
sexes, across all age groups, among those with 
cancer and diseases other than cancer, and in all 
care settings. The highest incidence was consis-
tently found among people dying with cancer, 
those younger than 80 years of age and those 
dying at home. Among reported cases, the pro-
portions involving patients aged 80 years or 
older, those dying in a care home setting, those 
dying of a disease other than cancer and those not 
having a terminal diagnosis increased, the latter 
particularly for cases reported in Dutch. Palliative 
care teams were increasingly consulted about the 
euthanasia request, beyond the legal requirements 
to do so, especially for cases reported in Dutch. 
Our findings showed an increase in eutha-
nasia among older persons and patients without 
terminal disease in the most recent years, 
whereas such cases were relatively rare in the 
first years of the euthanasia law. These findings 
might suggest an increase in the number of 
requests from these groups as they increasingly 
became aware of the legal possibility to request 
euthanasia. These findings might also reflect a 
decrease in reluctance to provide euthanasia 
within these groups as physicians became more 
experienced and the wider society became more 
familiar with these types of cases. We deem it 
less plausible that the trends indicate more vul-
nerable groups feeling increasingly forced to 
choose euthanasia. Moreover, all of the cases 
included in our analysis were approved by the 
committee, which implies a careful evaluation 
of each request without any external pressure. 
Given the annual increase in reported cases 
after legalization in Belgium, as described here, 
as well as in the Netherlands,21 it can be assumed 
that overburdening of the Belgian review com-
mittee may pose a problem, now or in the future. 
The Dutch review committees have already taken 
measures to address the increase in reported cases 
by implementing a new review method, which 
includes a preliminary screening to separate 
potentially contentious cases from less conten-
tious cases.22 It is desirable that review systems 
incorporate capacity measures that anticipate 
increases in reported cases, to guarantee the abil-
ity to perform the monitoring function.
The increase in the number of reported eutha-
nasia cases in Belgium is corroborated by a 
nationwide survey on medical end-of-life prac-
tices in Flanders, which found an increase in the 
euthanasia rate from 1.9% of all deaths in 2007 
to 4.6% in 2013.17 These data suggest an 
increase in the prevalence of euthanasia and not 
just in the reporting rate. Our study of reported 
cases also corroborates the results of that survey 
showing increases in groups that were previously 
less likely to request or receive euthanasia, such 
as older persons and those with diseases other 
than cancer.17,18 The gradual increase in accep-
tance of euthanasia within society is a likely rea-
son for these changes. 
In the early years after legalization, phys-
icians seem to have been more reluctant to grant 
euthanasia in cases of diseases other than can-
cer, perhaps because of uncertainty about its 
legality in such cases. Experience with the prac-
tice, reassurance through lack of prosecutions 
(with the first case since legalization being sent 
to the public prosecutor for judicial review only 
in October 2015), media reporting on controver-
sial cases and ensuing public debate about the

interpretation of legal criteria such as “incurable 
disorder” and “unbearable physical or psycho-
logic suffering” are likely to have contributed to 
a broadening of the previously narrow interpre-
tation of the legal criteria. The increase in eutha-
nasia among cases with noncancer diagnoses 
and nonterminal diseases emphasizes the impor-
tance of thorough evaluation and monitoring of 
the practice, since these situations are often 
more complex and may include psychiatric dis-
orders and “tiredness of life.”
The development of assisted dying has dif-
fered from one country to another. The Nether-
lands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, 
Colombia and 5 American states (Oregon, 
Washington, Montana, Vermont and California) 
allow some form of physician-assisted dying.23 
Official reports from Oregon, Vermont and 
Washington, where only physician-assisted sui-
cide is legal and euthanasia is not, have also 
shown an increase in the number of officially 
reported deaths, although with much lower inci-
dences than in Belgium and the Netherlands.23–28 
Even within Belgium, development of the prac-
tice has differed between Flanders and Wallonia, 
as our study shows. The relative underrepresen-
tation of reported euthanasia cases from the 
French-speaking community and the differ-
ences in case characteristics corroborate previ-
ous studies that found significant differences 
between Flanders and Wallonia in terms of 
practice, attitudes and knowledge about eutha-
nasia.10–12,14 These differences suggest that 
euthanasia legislation does not have a predeter-
mined effect on medical end-of-life practice 
and that social and cultural elements also influ-
ence its development.
Several specific factors may have contributed 
to development of the practice in Flanders. The 
existence of the Life End Information Forum in 
Flanders may have led to increased knowledge 
about euthanasia and standardized procedures in 
practice by providing advice on assisted dying 
and other end-of-life issues.29 The Life End 
Information Forum also provides specially 
trained physicians to act as the legally required 
second physician, which has been shown to con-
tribute to the careful practice of euthanasia.30,31 
A similar service, Forum End of Life, has been 
established in French-speaking Belgium, but it 
is more limited and less formalized. In addition, 
palliative care services are involved in Flemish 
euthanasia practice to a large extent,17 offering 
support during the decision-making process and 
during the performance of euthanasia. More-
over, the viewpoint of euthanasia as part of the 
palliative care continuum has been endorsed by 
the Federation of Palliative Care Flanders.32,33 
The current study showed an increase in consul-
tation with palliative care teams about the eutha-
nasia request, from 33.9% of all cases in 2003 to 
39.3% in 2013. However, the reporting form 
does not record whether patients have previ-
ously received palliative care. Finally, over the 
years of the study, the topic of euthanasia has 
received considerable attention in Flemish 
mainstream media and is an important issue of 
public debate.34
Limitations
Some limitations must be taken into account. 
The data provide insight into only those eutha-
nasia cases that were reported. Previous 
research, conducted in 2007, showed that about 
half of all euthanasia cases in Belgium were 
reported to the committee and that unreported 
cases were generally dealt with less carefully 
than reported cases.35 In addition, this study was 
based on an analysis of secondary data collected 
as part of the mandatory notification procedure. 
Details about the patients’ clinical circum-
stances and the precise nature of the suffering 
that caused them to seek euthanasia were not 
recorded in the database.
Conclusion
The practice of euthanasia in Belgium has 
increased year by year since the introduction of 
legis 
lation in 2002. An increase in cases often con-
sidered as more controversial, such as those involv-
ing neuropsychiatric conditions, has also occurred, 
although such cases remain a small minority.  
Given differences in developments between 
jurisdictions and even within Belgium, it is clear 
that societal and cultural contexts play a key role 
in how euthanasia practice has been adopted 
after legalization. Our analysis has shown the 
importance of detailed monitoring of euthanasia 
practice, provides relevant insights for evalua-
tion of the practice and can inform the debate 
about euthanasia worldwide.
