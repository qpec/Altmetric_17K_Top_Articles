Background: Approximately 1.5 million HIV-positive women become pregnant annually. Without treatment, up
to 45% will transmit HIV to their infants, primarily through breastfeeding. These numbers highlight that HIV
acquisition is a major health concern for women and children globally. They also emphasize the urgent need
for novel approaches to prevent HIV acquisition that are safe, effective and convenient to use by women and
children in places where they are most needed.
Methods: 4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine, a potent NRTI with low cytotoxicity, was administered orally to
NOD/SCID/gc2/2 mice and to bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) humanized mice, a preclinical model of HIV infec-
tion. HIV inhibitory activity in serum, cervicovaginal secretions and saliva was evaluated 4 h after administration.
4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine’s ability to prevent vaginal and oral HIV transmission was evaluated
using highly relevant transmitted/founder viruses in BLT mice.
Results: Strong HIV inhibitory activity in serum, cervicovaginal secretions and saliva obtained from animals after
a single oral dose of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (10 mg/kg) demonstrated efficient drug penetration
into relevant mucosal sites. A single daily oral dose of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine resulted in efficient
prevention of vaginal and oral HIV transmission after multiple high-dose exposures to transmitted/founder
viruses in BLT humanized mice.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine efficiently prevents both vagi-
nal and oral HIV transmission. Together with 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine’s relatively low toxicity and
high potency against drug-resistant HIV strains, these data support further clinical development of 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine as a potential pre-exposure prophylaxis agent to prevent HIV transmission in women
and their infants.
Introduction
HIV acquisition is a major health concern for women and children
globally. Most new HIV infections occur in women living in
resource-limited countries where gender, cultural and economic
barriers limit the ability of women to access and use HIV preven-
tion options.1 The majority of HIV-positive women are of repro-
ductive age and 1.5 million HIV-positive women become
pregnant every year.2 Without treatment, up to 45% will transmit
HIV to their infants, mostly through breastfeeding.3 In resource-
limited countries, HIV-positive women breastfeed their infants
despite the risk of HIV transmission due to the health benefits
of breast milk. Although paediatric HIV infection is associated
with an accelerated course of disease and increased mortality,
only 31% of HIV-infected children receive ART.4 Therefore, there
is an urgent need for novel approaches to prevent HIV acquisition
that are safe, effective and convenient to use by women and chil-
dren in places where they are most needed.
Antiretroviral (ARV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a preven-
tion strategy in which ARVs are administered to HIV-uninfected
individuals, can significantly reduce HIV transmission.5 – 8 In
women, PrEP can reduce vaginal HIV transmission up to 75%.7,8
Mother-to-child HIV transmission through breastfeeding is also
significantly reduced by daily administration of ARVs to infants
and/or their mothers.9 – 12 Despite the demonstrated efficacy of
PrEP to reduce HIV transmission to women and infants, these
strategies often require extended ARV use prompting concerns
about potential drug toxicity and the emergence and transmis-
sion of drug-resistant HIV strains if PrEP fails; e.g. infants that
receive daily oral nevirapine, the current first-line ARV for infant
PrEP, are at a significantly increased risk of acquiring nevirapine
resistance if infected.13 For these reasons, it is essential to develop

 novel ARVs with low toxicity and increased potency against clinic-
ally relevant HIV strains.
4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (EFdA, MK-8591), a
novel NRTI, has potent anti-HIV activity several orders of magni-
tude higher than currently approved NRTIs14–16 and an improved
intracellular half-life.16,17 Importantly, 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-
deoxyadenosine exhibits low cytotoxicity due to nearly negligible
incorporation into human mitochondrial DNA by DNA polymerase
g.14,18,19 Furthermore, 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine
retains significant potency against a broad range of clinically
important drug-resistant isolates, including HIV strains containing
the K65R RTmutation, which is associated with resistance to teno-
fovir, an ARV included in all PrEP regimens evaluated in women to
date.18,20 Studies on the in vivo protective efficacy of 4′-ethynyl-
2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine PrEP are very limited21 and it is cur-
rently not known if 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine PrEP
can prevent vaginal or oral HIV transmission of clinically relevant
HIV-1 strains. In this study, we utilized bone marrow/liver/thymus
(BLT) humanized mice22–28 individually bioengineered from NOD/
SCID/gc2/2 (NSG) immunodeficient mice, as a preclinical in vivo
model to evaluate the efficacy of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxy-
adenosine PrEP to prevent vaginal and oral HIV transmission fol-
lowing multiple high-dose challenges with relevant transmitted/
founder (T/F) viruses. Our results support further clinical develop-
ment of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine as a potential
PrEP agent to prevent HIV transmission to women and their
infants.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
To evaluate penetration of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine into
the cervicovaginal and oral mucosa, cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) and
saliva were collected 4 h after a single oral administration of 10 mg/kg
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine. In vitro HIV inhibitory activity
of serum, CVS and saliva obtained from 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-
deoxyadenosine-treated and control untreated animals was assessed
with a TZM-bl cell-based HIV infection assay.
The efficacy of oral 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine PrEP to pre-
vent vaginal and oral HIV infection in vivo was evaluated by exposing
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated and untreated BLT huma-
nized mice vaginally (HIV-1JR-CSF, HIV-1CH040 and HIV-1RHPA) or orally
(HIV-1JR-CSF, HIV-1CH4419 and HIV-1THRO) to three consecutive high-dose
HIV challenges. 4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine was administered
to BLT mice via oral gavage (10 mg/kg) once daily for 8 days and mice
were challenged with HIV 3–4 h after the second, fourth and sixth
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine doses. A power analysis was per-
formed to determine experimental group sizes needed to achieve �90%
power. BLT mice were randomly assigned to 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-
deoxyadenosine-treated and untreated (control) HIV exposure groups
and a Mann–Whitney U-test was performed to ensure that peripheral
blood humanization levels (%hCD45 and %hCD4) between exposure
groups were equivalent. Following HIV exposure, HIV infection was moni-
tored longitudinally in the peripheral blood of BLT mice by measuring
plasma HIV-RNA levels with real-time PCR and CD4+ T cell levels with
flow cytometry. At necropsy, HIV-DNA levels in tissues were determined
using real-time PCR (assay limit of detection: 10 copies). Protection in
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated BLT mice was defined by
the absence of detectable HIV-RNA in peripheral blood plasma and
HIV-DNA in tissues at necropsy (5–8 weeks post-4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-
deoxyadenosine initiation). Amplified HIV gag was sequenced to
determine the identity of the transmitting virus(es). The study was not
blinded and no HIV-exposed 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-
treated or untreated BLT mice were excluded from the data analysis and
no outliers were defined.
Ethics
Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions by the
Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine at the University of North
Carolina–Chapel Hill. All animal experiments were conducted following
NIH guidelines for the housing and care of laboratory animals and in
accordance to protocols reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of North Carolina–
Chapel Hill (permit number 15-168).
Preparation of BLT humanized mice
BLT humanized mice were prepared as previously described.22 – 24,26,28
Briefly, a sandwich of human thymus–liver–thymus tissue was implanted
under the kidney capsule of irradiated (200 rads) female NSG mice (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Following tissue implantation,
mice received autologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells via tail vein
injection. Starting at 8 weeks post-transplantation, human immune cell
reconstitution was monitored in the peripheral blood of BLT mice longitu-
dinally by flow cytometry as previously described.22–24,26,28 BLT mice are
reconstituted with a human immune system generated de novo. The pres-
ence of human CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells throughout
the female reproductive tract (FRT), oral cavity and upper gastrointestinal
tract that render BLT mice susceptible to vaginal and oral HIV transmission
was previously described.23–25
4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine preparation,
administration and sample collection
4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (kindly provided by Dr Parniak,
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine) was reconstituted in sterile
PBS at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. 4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadeno-
sine (10 mg/kg) was administered to mice orally once daily by oral gavage.
Peripheral blood was collected from animals with capillary tubes coated
with or without EDTA to isolate plasma or serum, respectively. CVS were
obtained by performing a cervicovaginal lavage with sterile PBS (three
washes of 20 mL each, �60 mL total volume). Saliva was collected follow-
ing an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1–0.3 mg pilocarpine in sterile PBS
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) to stimulate saliva production. All sam-
ples were stored at 2808C until analysis.
Generation and quantification of HIV
Stocks of HIV-1JR-CSF, HIV-1CH040, HIV-1RHPA, HIV-1CH4419 and HIV-1THRO
29–33
were generated as previously described25,28 and titred on TZM-bl cells (NIH
AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) to quantify the number of
tissue culture infectious units (TCIU)/mL.
TZM-bl cell culture and in vitro HIV-1 inhibition
by 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine
We used a TZM-bl cell-based HIV infection assay to evaluate the in vitro
HIV inhibitory activity of serum, CVS and saliva obtained from
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated animals. TZM-bl cells
were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 500 U/mL
penicillin and 500 mg/mL streptomycin (TZM-bl medium) and cultured at
378C and 5% CO2. TZM-bl cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density
of 1×105 cells per well in TZM-bl medium. The next day, the medium was
removed and 100 mL of diluted serum, CVS or saliva from 4′-ethynyl-
2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated animals collected 4 h after drug

 administration or from untreated control animals was added. Serum was
diluted 1:20, 1:100, 1:500, 1:2500, 1:12500 and 1:62500. CVS and saliva
were diluted 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320 and 1:640. Cells were incubated
for 30 min and 100 mL of TZM-bl medium containing 40 mg/mL
DEAE-dextran and 3×103 TCIU of HIV-1JR-CSF per well was added.
Approximately 48 h later, the medium was removed and the luciferase
substrate One-Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) supplemented
with 0.2%Triton X-100 was added to allow for the measurement of lucifer-
ase activity and to inactivate virus. Luciferase was measured with a
SpectraMax M3 Spectrometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
and the results normalized to the luciferase activity of cells infected with
HIV in the absence of serum, CVS or saliva and expressed as a percentage
of decrease in luciferase activity.
HIV exposure of BLT mice
To evaluate the ability of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine to pre-
vent vaginal HIV transmission following multiple virus challenges, BLT
mice were exposed vaginally to HIV-1JR-CSF (first challenge virus),
HIV-1CHO40 (second challenge virus) and HIV-1RHPA (third challenge virus)
4 h after administration of the second, fourth and sixth 4′-ethynyl-
2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine oral dose. Anaesthetized BLT mice were
exposed vaginally to 3.0×105 TCIU of HIV by pipetting virus (20 mL) directly
into the vaginal cavity. BLT mice were exposed orally to 1.4×106 TCIU of
HIV-1JR-CSF (first challenge virus), HIV-1CH4419 (second challenge virus) or
HIV-1THRO (third challenge virus) 3–4 h after administration of the second,
fourth and sixth 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine oral dose. Oral
exposures were performed by placing anaesthetized BLT mice on their
backs and pipetting virus (20 mL resuspended in RPMI medium) into
their oral cavity as previously described.25,27
Analysis of HIV infection in BLT mice
HIV infection was monitored longitudinally in the peripheral blood of BLT
mice by measuring HIV-RNA levels in plasma with a real-time PCR viral
load assay (assay sensitivity of 750 HIV-RNA copies/mL) and by determin-
ing CD4+ T cell levels with flow cytometric analysis as previously
described.22 – 24,26,28 The presence of HIV-DNA in tissues (spleen, lymph
nodes, bone marrow, human thymus, liver, lung and FRT) collected from
BLT mice at necropsy was determined by real-time PCR analysis of DNA
extracted from 5×104–4×106 mononuclear cells (assay limit of detection:
10 copies). Mononuclear cells were isolated as previously described.34,35
Briefly, mononuclear cells from human thymus, lymph nodes and spleen
were isolated by passing tissue through a cell strainer. Bones were homo-
genized with a mortar and pestle and homogenate passed through a cell
strainer to isolate bone marrow cells. The lung, liver and FRT were cut into
small pieces, digested in enzyme cocktail containing collagenase D and
DNAse for 30 min at 378C and then homogenized through a cell strainer.
Mononuclear cells were isolated from lung and liver homogenate with a
40%–70% Percoll gradient. Red blood cells were lysed with ammonium/
chloride/potassium lysis buffer. As a control for the presence of DNA
extracted from human cells, all samples were tested for the presence of
human gamma globin DNA by real-time PCR (range: 515–11807547
human gamma globin DNA copies).
Sequence analysis of transmitted viruses
The transmitting virus(es) in HIV-infected BLT mice exposed to multiple
viruses was/were identified by sequence analysis. Viral RNA was isolated
from plasma using QIAamp viral RNA columns (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and cDNA was gener-
ated using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) with the primer 5′-CTTCCAATTATGTTGACAGGTGTAGG-3′. cDNA was
amplified by nested PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). PCR primers were designed to anneal in
regions with the fewest possible primer mismatches to HIV-1CH040,
HIV-1JR-CSF, HIV-1CH4419, HIV-1RHPA and HIV-1THRO sequences. Primer
sequences were as follows: outer forward primer, 5′-CTCAATAAA
GCTTGCCTTGAGTGC-3′; outer reverse primer 5′-CTTCCAATTATGTTGA
CAGGTGTAGG-3′; inner forward primer, 5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA
GTGGC-3′; inner reverse primer 5′-CTGTATCATCTGCTCCTGTATCTAATA
GAGC-3′. The reverse inner primer 5′-CTGTATCATCTGCTCCTGTGTCTAA
GAG-3′ was used to sequence HIV-1CH4419 to increase sensitivity and
ensure detection. Amplified viral DNA of gag was sequenced and com-
pared with the sequences of challenge viruses.
To identify the emergence of drug-resistant mutations in the break-
through BLT mouse infected with HIV-1JR-CSF despite 4′-ethynyl-
2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine PrEP, the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1JR-CSF
was sequenced. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma using QIAamp
viral RNA kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated from RNA with Superscript
III RT (Invitrogen) with primer 5′-GCTCTATTAGATACAGGAGC-3′ followed
by nested PCR with Expand High Fidelity Kit (Roche) to amplify 1.5 kb region
of reverse transcriptase. The following primers were used: forward outer
primer 5′-CCTAATGCATATTGTGAGTCTG-3′, reverse outer primer 5′-GCT
CTATTAGATACAGGAGC-3′, forward inner primer 5′-CCTGCAAAGCTAGG
TGAATTGC-3′ reverse inner primer 5′-GTAGGACCTACACCTGTCAAC-3′.
Amplified viral DNA of reverse transcriptase was sequenced and compared
with the sequence of HIV-1JR-CSF.
FinchTV software (Geospiza, Seattle, WA, USA) was used to analyse
sequence chromatograms, NCBI BLAST was used to identify sequences
and ClustalW was used to align sequences.
Statistical analysis
A Mantel–Cox log-rank test was used to compare protection between
untreated and 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated BLT mice.
A two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare the in vitro HIV
inhibitory activity of serum, CVS and saliva samples obtained from
untreated and 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated animals
and the CD4+ T cell levels in the peripheral blood and tissues of protected
and HIV-infected BLT mice. All statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism software (version 6) (La Jolla, CA, USA).
Results
Efficient penetration of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-
deoxyadenosine into the cervicovaginal and
oral mucosa
ARVs must adequately penetrate into mucosal sites where HIV
exposure occurs to consistently prevent HIV acquisition. The FRT
is the first mucosal surface in women that HIV encounters follow-
ing vaginal exposure. In infants, the oral cavity is the first mucosal
surface exposed to HIV during breastfeeding. To assess the ability
of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine to distribute systemic-
ally (peripheral blood) and to penetrate into these two different
mucosal sites, we administered a single oral dose (10 mg/kg) of
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine to NSG or BLT mice. This
dose was chosen based on: (i) previously published pharmacoki-
netic analyses of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine in mice;
(ii) its ability to inhibit HIV infection following an intraperitoneal
HIV exposure; and (iii) its ability to suppress plasma viraemia
when administered daily.21 Four hours later, we collected periph-
eral blood, CVS and saliva from treated and untreated (control)
mice and analysed their HIV inhibitory activity using a well-
established in vitro assay. Our results indicate that peripheral
blood serum from both BLT and NSG mice treated with
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine contains potent HIV

 inhibitory activity (Figure 1a and d) suggesting comparable
distribution and penetration of active 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-
2′-deoxyadenosine in peripheral blood from both types of mice
(Figure 1a). Similarly, we observed strong HIV inhibitory activity
in the CVS from 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated
mice (P¼0.0016) (Figure 1b and d). Consistent with the known
presence of anti-HIV factors in saliva,36 HIV infection was
decreased in the presence of saliva from untreated (control) ani-
mals (Figure 1c and d). Nevertheless, we were able to document
strong HIV inhibitory activity in the saliva from 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated animals (P¼0.0161) well
above that in the saliva from untreated mice (Figure 1d).
Collectively, our analysis indicates that active 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine is systemically distributed after a single
oral administration and that it efficiently penetrates into the FRT
and oral cavity, the two primary sites of HIV acquisition in women
and infants.
4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine PrEP prevents
vaginal HIV transmission following multiple high-dose
challenges with T/F viruses
To assess the ability of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine to
prevent vaginal HIV transmission, we administered 4′-ethynyl-
2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (10 mg/kg) orally to BLT mice
(n¼11) once daily for 8 days. Six untreated BLT mice served as
positive controls. Mice were exposed vaginally to a high dose of
HIV-1JR-CSF (first challenge), HIV-1CH040 (second challenge) and
HIV-1RHPA (third challenge) 4 h after the second, fourth and
sixth 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine administration,
respectively (Figure 2a). We then monitored the levels of
HIV-RNA and CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood longitudinally.
Protection from HIV infection was confirmed at necropsy and
was defined as: (i) absence of detectable HIV-RNA in plasma; (ii)
absence of HIV-DNA in tissues; and (iii) lack of CD4+ T cell
depletion.
HIV transmission was observed in control BLT mice following a
single individual challenge to HIV-1JR-CSF, HIV-1CH040 or HIV-1RHPA
(Figure 2b to d). We also detected HIV-RNA in the plasma of all
control mice challenged vaginally after repeated single exposures
to the three different viruses (Figure 2e). Sequence analysis of
plasma HIV-RNA revealed that one or more viruses were transmit-
ted in BLT mice challenged with three different viruses. The major-
ity of BLT mice (five of six) were co-infected with HIV-1JR-CSF and
HIV-1CH040 the first and second challenge viruses, respectively
(Figure 2f). One animal was infected with HIV-1RHPA only, the
third challenge virus (Figure 2f).
In stark contrast, we did not detect HIV-RNA in any of the
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated BLT mice exposed

administered to BLT mice orally for 8 days. Untreated (n¼6) and EFdA-treated (n¼11) BLT mice were exposed vaginally to a high dose (3.0×105
TCIU) of HIV-1JR-CSF, HIV-1CH040 and HIV-1RHPA 4 h after administration of the second, fourth and sixth EFdA doses, respectively. Plasma HIV-RNA
levels were monitored longitudinally and tissue HIV-DNA levels were analysed at necropsy. Plasma HIV-RNA levels of untreated BLT mice exposed
vaginally to a single high dose of HIV-1JR-CSF (n¼3, J1–J3) (b), HIV-1CH040 (n¼5, C1–C5) (c) and HIV-1RHPA (n¼6, R1–R6) (d). (e) Plasma HIV-RNA

 to three consecutive high-dose vaginal challenges, once each
with HIV-1JR-CSF, HIV-1CH040 and HIV-1RHPA (Figure 2g). We also
did not detect HIV-DNA in any of the tissues analysed from
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated mice at necropsy
(Table S1, available as Supplementary data at JAC Online).
Longitudinal analysis of CD4+ T cell levels in peripheral blood
and in tissues at necropsy revealed that they were preserved
in 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated BLT mice
(Figure S1). Collectively, these data show that oral administration
of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine protects BLT mice from
HIV infection following multiple high-dose vaginal HIV challenges
(P¼0.0002) (Figure 2h).
4′-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine PrEP prevents oral
HIV transmission following multiple high-dose challenges
with T/F viruses
Breastfed infants are exposed to HIV in their mother’s breast milk
several times per day for periods that can extend over 1 year.
Infant HIV PrEP strategies must be able to protect against oral
HIV challenges under these extreme circumstances. Having
demonstrated strong in vitro anti-HIV activity in saliva after
oral administration of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine
(Figure 1c and d), we utilized a BLT mouse model of oral HIV trans-
mission25,27 to evaluate the ability of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-
deoxyadenosine PrEP to prevent HIV infection following multiple
high-dose oral HIV challenges. We administered 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (10 mg/kg) orally to BLT mice (n¼8) once
daily for 8 days and challenged these mice orally to HIV-1JR-CSF
(first exposure), HIV-1CH4419 (second exposure) and HIV-1THRO (third
exposure) 3–4 h after the second, fourth and sixth 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine doses, respectively (Figure 3a). Untreated
BLT mice (n¼5) exposed orally to HIV-1JR-CSF, HIV-1CH4419 and HIV-
1THRO served as positive controls.
HIV-RNA was readily detected in the plasma of all positive con-
trol BLT mice (Figure 3b). Longitudinal sequence analysis of
plasma HIV-RNA revealed that all three viruses were orally trans-
mitted in untreated BLT mice, albeit at different frequencies
(Figure 3c). The majority of mice (four of five) were infected with
the T/F viruses HIV-1CH4419 and/or HIV-1THRO. Two mice were co-
infected with HIV-1CH4419 and HIV-1THRO. HIV-1JR-CSF alone was
identified in the plasma of one control mouse.
In contrast, we did not detect HIV-RNA in the plasma or
HIV-DNA in the tissues of seven of eight 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-
deoxyadenosine-treated BLT mice (Figure 3d and Table S2).
Longitudinal sequence analysis of plasma HIV-RNA in the
HIV-infected
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated
mouse demonstrated transmission of the first challenge virus,
HIV-1JR-CSF (Figure 3c). Sequence analysis also revealed that
although 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine treatment con-
tinued for six additional days after HIV-1JR-CSF exposure, no RT
mutations associated with 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine
resistance emerged (Figure 3d).20 Analysis of CD4+ T cell levels
in peripheral blood longitudinally and in tissues at necropsy
also revealed that CD4+ T cell levels were significantly higher
in
protected
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated
mice (Figure S2). Collectively these data demonstrate that oral
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine PrEP significantly reduced
oral HIV transmission following multiple high-dose oral HIV chal-
lenges with relevant T/F viruses (P¼0.0031) (Figure 3e).
Discussion
Globally, adolescent girls and young women (15–24 years) are
twice as likely to be at risk of HIV infection compared with boys
and young men in the same age group. This higher risk of HIV is
associated with unsafe and often unwanted and forced sexual
activity and lack of access to information and health services.37
In areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest
incidence of HIV, the majority of new HIV infections occur in
women of reproductive age, which contributes to the increased
incidence of paediatric HIV infection.1,2 The vast majority of HIV-
infected children (�90%) acquire HIV from their mothers and
mostly through breastfeeding.38 Given the urgent need for novel
HIV prevention approaches for women and their infants, we
utilized a preclinical BLT humanized mouse model of HIV infec-
tion22–28to evaluate the efficacy of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxy-
adenosine, a novel NRTI that has the highest potency to date and
low toxicity profiles to prevent vaginal and oral HIV transmission.
Effective ARVs for PrEP in women and infants must be able to
penetrate efficiently into the FRTand oral mucosa, the first muco-
sal surfaces that contact HIV following vaginal and oral exposure,
respectively. ARV distribution into mucosal tissues and secretions
has been correlated with an ARV’s affinity to bind proteins in
plasma and/or mucosal tissues. The antiviral activity of NRTIs is
also reliant on their cellular uptake and phosphorylation into an
active form that can inhibit the RT enzyme.39 HIV target cells
(CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages) are present
throughout the FRT, which consists of two different types of
mucosa, i.e. a monolayer of columnar epithelial cells with tight
junctions in the endocervix, endometrium and fallopian tubes
(type I mucosa), and a multilayer of squamous epithelial cells in
the vagina and ectocervix (type II mucosa).40,41 HIV-susceptible
cells have also been demonstrated in the oral cavity, which is pro-
tected by multiple layers of stratified epithelial cells. However, in
comparison to adults, the oral mucosa of infants is incompletely
stratified and contains lower levels of innate anti-HIV factors ren-
dering it much more susceptible to HIV infection.42,43 Our results
showing strong in vitro HIV inhibitory activity in serum, CVS and
saliva after a single oral dose of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyade-
nosine demonstrates efficient penetration of active 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine into highly relevant mucosal sites of
transmission following a vaginal or oral HIV challenge. Even
after a 20-fold dilution, the CVS and saliva of 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-treated animals significantly inhibited
HIV infection in vitro (50% inhibition CVS, 90% inhibition saliva).
It should be noted that in vitro antiviral activity data provide evi-
dence for efficient drug penetration in CVS and saliva. However, it
does not offer information regarding the levels of phosphorylated
drug in cells. Therefore, further analysis will be necessary to evalu-
ate 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine intracellular levels, of
its active intracellular phosphorylated form, in target tissues.
BLT mice have been extensively utilized as an in vivo preclinical
tool to evaluate systemic and topical ARV PrEP strategies.22–24,26,28
The presence of human CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic
cells at important mucosal sites of HIV acquisition including the
FRT, oral cavity and upper gastrointestinal tract render BLT mice
susceptible to vaginal and oral HIV transmission.24,25 Here, we
utilized BLT mice to evaluate the protective efficacy of 4′-
ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine against repeated high-dose
vaginal and oral HIV challenges mimicking multiple high-risk

 exposures. Breastfed infants in particular are challenged multiple
times per day with HIV as they ingest their mother’s breast milk.
Our results indicate that oral administration of 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine provided sufficient distribution of
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine into relevant mucosal
tissues to prevent vaginal and oral HIV transmission after multiple
high-dose exposures. Importantly, 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxy-
adenosine prevented HIV infection after exposure to highly
relevant T/F viruses (Table 1) demonstrating that 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine has potent in vivo antiviral activity

 against the viruses that are responsible for establishing infection.
Recently, it was reported that the active intracellular tri-
phosphorylated form of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine
has a long intracellular half-life in humans;44 therefore, it will be
important in future experiments to evaluate lower doses of 4′-
ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine in BLTmice and to determine
whether a single dose of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine
can prevent vaginal and oral HIV acquisition and what is the dur-
ation of protection.
Although multiple clinical trials have indicated that ARV PrEP
can prevent HIV acquisition, protection is not 100%, raising con-
cerns about the emergence of drug resistance in individuals that
become infected with HIV despite PrEP. In clinical trials of PrEP in
serodiscordant couples, PrEP-selected drug resistance is rare
when infection occurs in the presence of PrEP.45 In contrast,
infants that become infected with HIV while receiving nevirapine
PrEP are at a significantly increased risk of developing nevirapine
resistance.13 Drug resistance can emerge in infants who receive a
single dose of nevirapine.46 In our study, we observed one break-
through infection in a 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine-
treated BLT mouse exposed orally to HIV. Sequence analysis
of plasma HIV-RNA indicated that HIV-1JR-CSF, an early passage
isolate and the first challenge virus, was transmitted despite
4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine PrEP. In this study,
HIV-1JR-CSF was transmitted in only one of five control animals
despite our previously published results, which demonstrate faith-
ful transmission of HIV-1JR-CSF in BLT mice challenged orally with a
single high virus dose.25,27
The majority of control animals were infected with the T/F
virus(es) HIV-1THRO and/or HIV-1CH4419. Our results here support
the concept that molecular and biological determinants bestow
a selective advantage for mucosal transmission of T/F viruses.
Since HIV-1JR-CSF was the first challenge virus, our results could
also indicate that drug absorption in target tissue might be low
and that allowing for greater drug accumulation at sites of expos-
ure the effectiveness of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine
PrEP may increase over time. Although we did not detect the
emergence of RT resistance mutations following oral HIV acquisi-
tion in the presence of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine
PrEP, it is important to note that 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyade-
nosine was only administered for an additional 6 days after the
first HIV challenge. Infants that acquire HIV while receiving ARV
PrEP may continue to receive ARVs for several weeks before infec-
tion is confirmed. Therefore, future studies may be needed to
examine the emergence of 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadeno-
sine resistance upon extended 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadeno-
sine administration in the context of HIV infection. Nonetheless, our
results combined with those of others demonstrating 4′-ethynyl-2-
fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine’s high genetic barrier to resistance20
indicate that the risk of developing 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxy-
adenosine-resistant HIV strains in vivo is lower compared with
nevirapine, the current first-line ARV for PrEP in infants.
Significant gender inequalities limit the ability of women to
access and exercise HIVprevention options resulting in earlier acqui-
sition of infection, higher transmission rates and increased mother-
to-child transmission of HIV. Collectively, our in vivo results demon-
strating 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine’s excellent efficacy
in preventing both vaginal and oral HIV transmission together
with its relatively low toxicity and high potency against drug-resist-
ant HIV strains support 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine as a
potential PrEP agent for use in women and infants, two of the
most vulnerable populations at risk for acquiring HIV.

BLT mice were dosed orally with 10 mg/kg EFdA daily for 8 days and challenged vaginally or orally with the indicated HIV-1 isolates 3–4 h after the
second, fourth and sixth EFdA doses. Untreated mice challenged with a single dose or multiple doses of HIV-1 served as positive controls for transmis-
sion. Peripheral blood humanization levels at the time of HIV exposure indicate the percentage of human CD45+ (hCD45+) of live cells and the percent-
age of human CD4+ (hCD4+) of live hCD45+CD3+ cells. HIV transmission was defined by the presence of HIV-RNA in plasma and/or HIV-DNA in tissues
at necropsy.
