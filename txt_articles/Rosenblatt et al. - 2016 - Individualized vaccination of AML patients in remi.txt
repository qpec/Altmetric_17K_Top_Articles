Abstract
We developed a personalized cancer vaccine in which patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) cells are fused with autologous dendritic cells, generating a hybridoma that potently 
stimulates broad antitumor responses. We report results obtained from the first 17 AML patients, 
who achieved remission after chemotherapy and were then serially vaccinated to target minimal 
residual disease and prevent relapse. Vaccination was well tolerated and induced inflammatory 
responses at the site of administration, characterized by the dense infiltration of T cells. 
Vaccination was also associated with a marked rise in circulating T cells recognizing whole AML 
cells and leukemia-specific antigens that persisted for more than 6 months. Twelve of 17 
vaccinated patients (71%; 90% confidence interval, 52 to 89%) remain alive without recurrence at 
a median follow-up of 57 months. The results demonstrate that personalized vaccination of AML 
patients in remission induces the expansion of leukemia-specific T cells and may be protective 
against disease relapse.

 INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematological malignancy for which 
chemotherapy is rarely curative, particularly in older patients (1). In contrast to cytotoxic 
therapy, immune therapy offers an opportunity to broadly target the malignant cells and 
provide immunologic memory to prevent recurrence. The efficacy of cellular 
immunotherapy is supported by the observation that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation is curative for a subset of patients because of the graft-versus-leukemia effect 
mediated by alloreactive lymphocytes (2). Conversely, allogeneic transplantation is 
associated with marked morbidity and mortality resulting from the lack of specificity of the 
alloreactive response, which results in graft-versus-host disease. An important area of 
investigation is therefore the development of strategies to induce immune responses that 
selectively eliminate leukemia cells.
AML offers an opportunity to explore the role of immunotherapy. The majority of patients 
achieve a complete remission after chemotherapy; however, cytotoxic therapy is curative for 
only a minority of patients, and most patients relapse with resistant disease. This therapeutic 
challenge is highlighted in AML patients 60 years and older. After achieving remission, only 
15 to 20% of this population remains free of leukemia for 2 years (1, 3, 4). Even for patients 
under the age of 60, relapse after achieving chemotherapy-induced remission is common, 
with a 5-year survival rate of 34% for patients treated with intensive postremission 
chemotherapy (5). Allogeneic transplantation offers a potential for durable remission, 
particularly for patients with high-risk disease (2). However, allogeneic transplantation may 
not be feasible for many AML patients, as a result of age, comorbidities, availability of a 
suitable donor, and considerable treatment-associated morbidity and mortality.
We have developed a personalized vaccine in which patient-derived AML cells are fused 
with autologous dendritic cells (DCs), presenting a broad array of antigens in the context of 
DC-derived costimulation (6). In animal models, vaccination with DC/tumor fusions results 
in eradication of established metastatic disease (7–9). In phase I and II trials for patients 
with multiple myeloma (MM), we found that vaccination with DC/MM fusions is well 
tolerated and induces antitumor immune and clinical responses in a subset of patients (10, 
11). Here, AML patients in remission were vaccinated with DC/AML fusions with the goal 
of eliciting a leukemia-specific immune response to immunologically eradicate residual 
disease. The results demonstrate that this personalized vaccine induces anti-AML cell 
immunity and provides protection against disease relapse.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
The characteristics of the 19 AML patients who completed vaccine generation are 
summarized in Table 1. The median age was 63 years. Eleven patients had intermediate or 
high-risk disease, and eight patients had favorable risk disease (12) (table S1). Two patients 
completed vaccine generation but did not receive any vaccination because of relapsed AML 
(n = 1) or ongoing chemotherapy-related toxicity precluding initiation of vaccination (n = 1). 
Seventeen patients initiated vaccination; 16 patients received at least two doses of vaccine,

 and 1 patient relapsed after having received only one dose of vaccine. The median time from 
achieving remission to initiating vaccination was 171 days (range, 73 to 197 days). The 
median time from completing postremission chemotherapy to initiating vaccination was 56 
days (range, 38 to 118 days). Twenty-eight patients underwent tumor cryopreservation but 
did not complete vaccine generation (table S2).
Vaccine characterization
The mean yield of the DC and AML cells was 169 × 106 and 95 × 106 cells, respectively. 
The mean fusion efficiency (DC fused to AML cells), as determined by the percentage of 
cells that coexpressed distinct DC (CD80, CD86, and CD83) and AML (CD38, CD34, 
CD117, CD64, or MUC1) antigens, was 40%. The mean viability of the DC, AML, and 
fusion preparations was 90, 91, and 86%, respectively (table S3). In contrast to AML blasts, 
the DC and fusion preparations potently stimulated allogeneic T cell proliferation (mean 
stimulation indices, 3.7, 16.9, and 11.7, respectively; table S4). Fourteen of 17 patients 
received three doses of the vaccine, and two patients received two doses, one due to 
limitations of cell yields and one due to disease relapse before the third vaccine. One patient 
received one vaccine and relapsed before the second vaccine.
Adverse events
Vaccination was well tolerated, and no evidence of symptomatic autoimmunity was 
observed. Potential related adverse events were transient and of grade 1 to 2 intensity (Table 
2). The most common adverse event was erythema, pruritis, and/or induration at the vaccine 
site. Biopsy of vaccine site reactions demonstrated a dense infiltrate of CD4 and CD8 T 
cells, consistent with recruitment of reactive T cell populations to the vaccine bed (Fig. 1).
Cellular immunologic response to vaccination
Vaccination with DC/AML fusions induced the expansion of leukemia-specific T cells in the 
peripheral blood and bone marrow, as determined by the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells expressing interferon-γ (IFN-γ) upon ex vivo exposure to autologous tumor lysate. 
Consistent with these findings, vaccination also resulted in the expansion of CD8+ T cells 
recognizing previously identified AML antigens quantified by pentamer analysis in human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA)–A2.1 patients. After recovery from consolidation chemotherapy, 
AML-specific T cells were nearly undetectable in the peripheral blood and bone marrow 
(Fig. 2). Vaccination resulted in a 5.4-fold increase in AML-specific CD4+ T cells (P = 
0.003) and a 15.7-fold increase in AML-specific CD8+ T cells (P = 0.0001), comparing 
prevaccination numbers to peak numbers after vaccination (n = 16; Fig. 2, A to E, and fig. 
S1). Circulating leukemia-reactive T cells remained elevated 6 months after the last 
vaccination at the time of last assessment (fig. S1). In HLA-A*0201 patients, vaccination 
resulted in the expansion of peripheral blood T cells recognizing MUC1 (4.4-fold increase), 
WT1 (2.7-fold increase), and NY-ESO (3.8-fold increase) tumor antigens (n = 4; Fig. 3, A to 
E, and fig. S2). Vaccination was associated with a 4.7-fold increase in leukemic reactive 
CD8+ T cells in the bone marrow from before vaccination to 1 month after the last 
vaccination (n = 5; fig. S3A). An expansion in bone marrow–infiltrating T cells recognizing 
MUC1 (ninefold increase) and WT1 (eightfold increase) was observed from before 
vaccination to 1 month after vaccination (n = 3; fig. S3, B and C)

 Quantification of regulatory T cell and PD-1–expressing T cells in the peripheral blood
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that, in addition to activated T cells, vaccination may 
result in the expansion of inhibitory cell populations that can mute clinical effects. 
Circulating regulatory T cell (Treg) populations, defined as those coexpressing CD4/CD25 
and FOXP3, were quantified before each vaccination and serially after vaccination. 
Circulating Tregs were present in low numbers before vaccination (mean, 7.18%; n = 13) and 
did not increase throughout the period of vaccination (mean, 5.57 and 5.43% before the 
second and third vaccine, respectively; n = 13; fig. S4A) or at the 6th month follow-up 
(mean, 7.04%; n = 13). Similarly, PD-1 expression on circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cell 
populations was unchanged during the period of vaccination and follow-up (fig. S4B). No 
change was observed in the percentage of bone marrow– infiltrating Tregs after vaccination 
(fig. S4C).
Clinical response
The study population had a median age of 63 years. Thirteen of 19 patients who completed 
vaccine generation are in remission [68%; 90% confidence interval (CI), 51 to 86%]. Twelve 
of 17 patients who received at least one dose of vaccine remain alive and in remission (71%; 
90% CI, 52 to 89%) at 16.7 to 66.5 months from initiating vaccination, with a median 
follow-up of 57 months. As a notable example, a 77-year-old female who relapsed within 1 
year of primary induction chemotherapy underwent vaccination after achieving a second 
remission. She remains in remission at 53 months of follow-up from vaccination. No patient 
has relapsed 1 year after completing the vaccination. The 4-year progression-free survival 
(PFS) rate is 71% (90% CI, 52 89%). Notably, median PFS and overall survival (OS) have 
not been reached (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
AML offers a particular therapeutic challenge. The majority of patients achieve a remission 
after chemotherapy; however, only a small minority experience durable responses, 
particularly among patients over the age of 60. Only 15 to 20% of the population remains 
free of leukemia at 2 years (1, 3, 4). Even in patients under the age of 60 who achieve 
complete remission and receive intensive postremission chemotherapy, the 5-year survival 
rate is about 35% (5). The high rate of recurrence after induction chemotherapy is thought to 
arise from the persistence of clonal populations intrinsically resistant to cytotoxic injury, 
including the malignant stem cell population resulting in the repopulation of disease in 6 to 
12 months. In contrast, the efficacy of cellular immunotherapy for AML is highlighted by 
the observation that allogeneic transplantation is potentially curative for a subset of patients 
because of the immunologic capacity of alloreactive lymphocytes to broadly eradicate the 
malignant clonal population (2). However, the application of this strategy is often limited by 
prohibitive treatment–associated morbidity and mortality due to damage to normal tissues in 
the context of graft-versus-host disease and other complications of therapy.
An important focus of investigation is therefore the development of AML vaccines to induce 
immune responses that will more selectively eliminate AML cells. However, to our 
knowledge, there are presently no vaccines that have shown promise in the treatment of

 AML. Strategies to design AML vaccines have included single antigen–based approaches, 
such as WT1 peptide administered with adjuvant (13, 14), DCs loaded with tumor-
associated antigens (15, 16), or the use of AML cells differentiated into DCs (17). Immune 
responses have been observed in several studies. In some patients, evidence of clinical effect 
was demonstrated with a reduction in peripheral blasts, and several patients have 
demonstrated prolonged survival of at least 3 years (16, 18–20). The results of the present 
study are more robust, with 70% of vaccinated patients demonstrating long-term remission. 
Both the potent immune response evoked by the DC/AML fusion cell vaccine and the 
incorporation of vaccination after cytoreductive chemotherapy likely account for the 
promising clinical outcomes observed in this study.
Notably, marked responses have been seen in a subset of patients with acute lymphocytic 
leukemia undergoing adoptive immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) 
cell therapy, in which persistence of the tumor-specific T cells has been associated with 
durable response (21). However, identifying a target that is broadly expressed on myeloid 
blasts, and one that is unique to the malignant myeloid blast population, to spare off target 
toxicity, has proved challenging. As a result, the application of CAR-T cell therapy to 
patients with AML has been limited to date.
Present studies describe a personalized vaccine in which patient-derived AML cells are 
fused with autologous DCs, incorporating antigens that capture the heterogeneity of the 
leukemia cell population and presenting them in the context of the potent antigen–presenting 
machinery of the DC. The fusion cell vaccine thus captures the clonal heterogeneity of the 
malignant population, including the presence of neoantigens, and creates a balanced 
cytotoxic and helper T cell response less susceptible to immune escape. Additionally, 
DC/AML fusions induce a polyclonal helper and cytotoxic T cell immune response that 
includes targeting of the leukemia stem cell population. We hypothesized that 
chemotherapy-induced remission would augment vaccine response by optimizing tumor 
cytoreduction and reducing the immunosuppressive effect on the bone marrow 
microenvironment and create a suitable platform to immunologically target persisting 
chemotherapy-resistant clones and achieve cures.
Our results support the efficacy of this vaccine in AML patients who achieve a remission 
after chemotherapy. Twelve of 17 patients (71%) remain in remission with a median of 57 
months of follow-up, and no patient has relapsed more than 1 year after chemotherapy and 
vaccination. Patients remaining in remission include several patients over age 70. One 
patient who relapsed within 1 year of initial chemotherapy underwent vaccination after 
achieving a second chemotherapy-induced remission and remains in remission more than 4 
years after completing chemotherapy. The long-term remission observed after chemotherapy 
and vaccination of a patient who had experienced early relapse after initial induction therapy 
is distinctly unusual in the absence of allogeneic transplantation, supporting the notion that 
this vaccine induces sustained responses and potentially cures.
The clinical effects of the vaccine were observed in the context of sustained induction of 
AML-specific immunity, as measured by the expansion of AML-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells in the peripheral blood. A concomitant rise in leukemia-specific T cells in the bone

 marrow supports the notion that the immune response is generated in this critical 
microenvironment. The specificity of the immune response is further supported by the 
expansion of T cells recognizing the leukemia-associated antigens WT1, MUC1, and NY-
ESO. In this context, MUC1 is only expressed by leukemia stem cells, as compared to 
normal hematopoietic stem cells, consistent with the potential targeting of this self-renewing 
population (22). It is important to assess whether there is a correlation between the nature of 
the immune response to vaccination and clinical outcome. Here, five relapsed patients did 
not provide enough power to assess whether the immune response differed in the relapsed 
patients compared to the 12 patients who demonstrated sustained remission. The expansion 
of AML-specific T cells peaked at 2 months after vaccination and persisted at 6 months after 
treatment, the last time point measured. Thus, the role of booster vaccination in maintaining 
the response should be evaluated.
Vaccination with DC/AML fusions was well tolerated, with toxicity predominantly limited 
to reactions associated with recruitment of activated T cells into the vaccine site. This 
response stands in contrast to toxicities observed with nonspecific activation of the immune 
system in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the infusion of constitutively 
activated T cells, which include pneumonitis and the cytokine release syndrome, respectively 
(23–25).
Recent studies have demonstrated that up-regulation of immune checkpoint signaling 
through the PD-L1/PD-1 and Tim3 pathways induces tolerance in AML (26). Here, late 
relapse resulting from the reestablishment of tolerance also remains a possibility. In response 
to this concern, future work will need to combine vaccination with blockade of the PD-L1/
PD-1 pathway. Moreover, the results reported here with the personalized AML vaccine will 
need to be confirmed in a multicenter randomized trial of postremission vaccination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The protocol was approved by the Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review 
Board, and is registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (NCT01096602). All patients provided 
written informed consent. The primary objective of the study was to assess the toxicity 
associated with treating AML patients with DC/AML fusion cells in the postchemotherapy 
setting. The secondary objective was to explore immunological response to DC/AML fusion 
vaccination in patients who have achieved a chemotherapy-induced remission and to define 
antitumor effects by determining time to disease progression. Patients with newly diagnosed 
or first relapsed AML were potentially eligible for collection and cryopreservation of 
primary leukemia samples. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease, evidence of 
symptomatic organ dysfunction, or other unstable comorbid medical illness were excluded. 
Patients who achieved complete remission after one to two courses of standard induction 
therapy but were deemed not appropriate for allogeneic transplantation and did not have 
ongoing grade 3 to 4 chemotherapy–related toxicity were assigned to the vaccine generation 
and administration phase of the protocol. Vaccines were generated during consolidation 
chemotherapy, with up to four cycles of postremission therapy permitted at the discretion of 
the treating physician. The vaccine was administered 1 to 3 months after the last cycle of

 chemotherapy. Three doses of 5 × 106 fusion cells were administered at monthly intervals. 
No other anti-leukemia therapy was permitted. The study was not randomized or blinded; all 
patients who completed vaccine production and met eligibility criteria to initiate vaccination 
were treated with the DC/AML fusion vaccine. All toxicities were graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. If ≥3 patients experienced 
treatment limiting toxicity, the study was to be suspended. Patients were monitored for 1 
week after administration of vaccine during the period of immunotherapy and then monthly 
thereafter for 6 months during which time they were assessed for evidence of treatment-
related toxicities with particular attention to autoimmune disease and cytopenias. Patients 
experiencing treatment-related grade 3 or higher toxicity were not eligible to receive further 
therapy. Immune response was measured by percentage of T cells that express IFN-γ as 
determined by the ratio of the maximum IFN-γ expression to the baseline level pretherapy.
Reagents for vaccine characterization and immunologic assays
The following were purchased from from BD PharMingen: (i) Purified mouse anti-human 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, CD40, CD83, CD38, CD34, 
and CD117; (ii) CD14 phycoerythrin (PE)–conjugated mouse anti-human mAbs against 
CD4; (iii) fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated anti-CD4 (RPA-T4, IgG1) and anti-
CD8 (RPA-T8, IgG1); (iv) FITC-, PE-conjugated matching isotype IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b 
controls; and (v) purified mouse monoclonal IgG1 (MOPC-21) isotype control. The mAb 
DF3 (anti–MUC1-N) has been described previously (27). Anti-human CD4 TC-conjugated, 
matching isotype control (IgG2a), PE-conjugated anti-human mAbs against IFN-γ (mouse 
IgG1-B27), and PE-conjugated matching isotype controls (rat IgG1-PE and mouse IgG1-PE) 
were purchased from Invitrogen. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (IgG1) was purchased 
from Chemicon International.
Vaccine generation, characterization, and administration
AML cells were collected by aspiration of 20 to 30 cm3 of bone marrow, 40 to 50 cm3 of 
peripheral blood in those patients with a high number of circulating blasts, or leukapheresis 
collections in patients requiring emergent cytoreduction because of the risk of leukostasis. 
Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved 
in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/90% autologous plasma. Patients eligible for vaccine 
generation underwent a single leukapheresis collection for DC generation and vaccine 
production. Adherent cells were cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF) (1000 U/ml; Sanofi) and IL-4 (500 IU/ml; CellGenix) for 5 to 7 days and 
matured in the presence of tumor necrosis factor–α (25 ng/ml; CellGenix) for 2 to 3 days. 
The DC and thawed autologous AML preparations were analyzed by immunocytochemical 
staining and then co-cultured with polyethylene glycol to generate DC/tumor fusions, as 
previously described (11). DC/AML fusions were (i) quantified by determining the 
percentage of cells that coexpress specific DC (CD80, CD83, or CD86) and tumor-
associated antigens (CD34, CD38, CD64, CD117, or MUC1) by immunohistochemical 
analysis, (ii) assessed for sterility, (iii) cryopreserved in autologous plasma (90%) and 
DMSO (10%) in single dose vials of 5 × 106 fusion cells, and (iv) stored frozen in the vapor 
phase of liquid nitrogen. At the time of administration, the fused cells were irradiated with 
30 Gy and administered as a subcutaneous injection in the upper thigh at 4-week intervals

 for a total of three doses. GM-CSF (100 μg) was administered at the vaccine site on the day 
of vaccination and for 3 days thereafter. As a measure of their potency as antigen-presenting 
cells, the capacity of DC/AML fusion cells to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation was 
assessed. T cells were obtained from commercially available leukopak collections obtained 
from the Crimson Core Department of Pathology, Brigham and Woman’s Hospital, Harvard 
Medical School. T cells (1 × 105) were cocultured with DC/AML fusion cells, DCs, or AML 
blasts at a ratio of 10:1 for 5 days. T cell proliferation was determined by measuring 
incorporation of [3H]thymidine after overnight pulsing (1 μCi per well) of triplicate samples.
Vaccine induction of immunologic response
Patients underwent serial assessment to quantify circulating and bone marrow–derived T 
cells reactive with whole autologous AML cells and previously identified leukemia-
associated antigens. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were 
collected before each vaccination and at 1, 3, and 6 months thereafter. After the last 
vaccination, PBMC samples were thawed, and 1 × 106 cells were cultured with lysate 
generated by repeated freeze thaw cycles of 1 × 105 autologous leukemia cells for 5 days. 
Cells were restimulated with autologous tumor lysate for 6 hours and cultured overnight 
with BD GolgiStop (1 μg/ml). We determined the intracellular expression of IFN-γ by CD4+ 
or CD8+ T cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of permeabilized 
cells. We also quantified leukemia-reactive T cells in the bone marrow before and 1 month 
after completion of vaccination in a subset of patients. In HLA-A2.1 patients, the number of 
circulating CD8+ T cells binding the MUC1 (antigenic peptide LLLLTVLTV), WT1 
(antigenic peptide RMFPNAPYL), and NY-ESO (antigenic peptide SLLMWITQV) 
pentamers was determined by bi-dimensional FACS analysis using CD8-FITC and the 
corresponding pentamer-PE antibody.
Regulatory T cells were quantified by determining the expression of FOXP3 by CD4/CD25 
cells using intracellular FACS analysis. PD-1 expression on circulating CD4 and CD8 T cell 
populations was assessed by flow cytometry. In one patient, vaccine site reactions underwent 
biopsy and immunocytochemical staining to assess infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells. 
Recruitment of native DCs was assessed by CD1a expression in the vaccine site.
Clinical disease assessment—Disease assessment was monitored by complete blood 
counts with differential and a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy a week before initiation of 
vaccination and 4 weeks and 3 and 6 months after completion of therapy. Cytogenetic 
evaluation was performed on bone marrow specimens in patients who had abnormal 
cytogenetics at presentation. Patients were monitored for disease relapse with assessments 
every 3 months.
Statistical analysis—For analysis of immune response to vaccination, fold change of 
IFN-γ by CD4+ or CD8+ T cells between prevaccine measurement and 1 month after the last 
vaccination was summarized as median, mean, and SD. A paired t test was used to assess 
whether the ratio of expression of these markers differed from 1. PFS was defined as the 
time from the date of first vaccine to the date of relapse or death from any cause, and OS 
was defined as the date from first vaccine to the date of death. Kaplan-Meier method was

 Fig. 2. Expansion of leukemia-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after vaccination
(A) A representative example of intracellular expression of IFN-γ by CD8+ T cells before 
and serially after vaccination is shown. (B and C) The percentages of CD8+ (B) and CD4+ 
(C) T cells expressing IFN-γ for individual study patients before initiating vaccination 
(white), and peak response after vaccination (black) are shown. (D and E) Mean percentages 
of leukemia-specific T cells before vaccination and peak after vaccination. Mean 
percentages of CD8+ (D) and CD4+ (E) T cells expressing IFN-γ after ex vivo exposure to 
autologous tumor lysate are shown before initiating vaccination and at the peak time after 
vaccination. The results are presented as means ± SEM from 16 vaccinated patients.

 Fig. 3. Expansion of MUC1, WT1, NY-ESO, survivin pentamer+ cells after vaccination
CD8+ T cells binding the MUC1, WT1, NY-ESO, and survivin pentamers were quantified at 
serial time points (before each of three vaccinations and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the third 
vaccination) in patients who are HLA-A2.1. Binding to a control pentamer was quantified in 
parallel, and the control value was subtracted from that obtained for the indicated pentamer. 
(A) A representative example demonstrating the percentage of circulating pentamer+ cells 
before and after vaccination is shown. (B to E). Percentages of circulating T cells 
recognizing MUC1 (B), WT1 (C), NY-ESO (D), and survivin (E) before (white bar) and 
peak after vaccination (black bar) for individual patients are shown.
