ABSTRACT
Background. Relative blood volume (RBV) monitoring is
widely used in hemodialysis (HD) patients, yet the association
between intradialytic RBV and mortality is unknown.
Methods. Intradialytic RBV was recorded once/min during a 6-
month baseline period; all-cause mortality was noted during
follow-up. RBV at 1, 2 and 3 h into HD served as a predictor of
all-cause mortality during follow-up. We employed Kaplan–
Meier analysis, univariate and adjusted Cox proportional haz-
ards models for survival analysis.
Results. We studied 842 patients. During follow-up (median
30.8months), 249 patients (29.6%) died. The following hourly
RBV ranges were associated with improved survival: first hour,
93–96% [hazard ratio (HR) 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI)
0.42–0.79)]; second hour, 89–94% [HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.39–0.75)];
third hour, 86–92% [HR 0.46 (95% CI 0.33–0.65)]. In about one-
third of patients the RBV was within these ranges and in two-
thirds it was above. Subgroup analysis by median age (�/>
61years), sex, race (white/nonwhite), predialysis systolic blood
pressure (SBP; �/> 130mmHg) and median interdialytic weight
gain (�/> 2.3kg) showed comparable favorable RBV ranges.
Patients with a 3-h RBV between 86 and 92% were younger, had
higher ultrafiltration volumes and rates, similar intradialytic aver-
age and nadir SBPs and hypotension rates, lower postdialysis SBP
and a lower prevalence of congestive heart failure when compared
with patients with an RBV >92%. In the multivariate Cox analysis,
RBV ranges remained independent and significant outcome
predictors.
Conclusion. Specific hourly intradialytic RBV ranges are asso-
ciated with lower all-cause mortality in chronic HD patients.

INTRODUCTION
In hemodialysis (HD) patients, adequate volume control is one of
the major challenges. Between consecutive treatments, interdialytic
weight
gain
(IDWG)
results
primarily
in
expansion
of
the extracellular volume (ECV) [1]. Excessive and chronic ECV ex-
pansion is associated with cardiovascular morbidity, such as hyper-
tension, left ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary congestion,
inflammation and increased mortality [2–5]. In most HD sessions,
the ultrafiltration rate (UFR) exceeds the refill rate of fluid from
the interstitium into the vascular space, resulting in a decline in
blood volume, potentially precipitating intradialytic hypotension
(IDH) and decreased perfusion of vital organs [6–9].
Intradialytic monitoring of relative blood volume (RBV) has
been introduced with the expectation that it may prevent IDH
by allowing the staff or the dialysis machine to maintain the
RBV above a patient-specific critical level [10–13]. Since some
of the technologies derive RBV changes from measured hemat-
ocrit changes, the term ‘crash-crit’ has been coined. It was
hoped that there would be a patient-specific critical RBV that
could be identified, below which IDH would be more likely to
occur. Unfortunately, no firm evidence for the existence of a
reproducible patient-specific crash-crit (or, conversely, an RBV
threshold) has been established. Andrulli et al. [14] were not
able to identify critical RBV levels for the development of symp-
tomatic hypotension, neither in hypotensive, normotensive nor
hypertensive patients, showing the variability of RBV across
patients and also across treatments. The randomized controlled
Crit-Line Intradialytic Monitoring Benefit (CLIMB) Study [15]
tested the hypothesis that the availability of hematocrit-based
intradialytic RBV monitoring with the Crit-Line monitor
(CLM) as a voluntary adjunct to clinical care would decrease
morbidity associated with ultrafiltration in comparison with

 patients managed using conventional clinical care. The primary
outcome was hospitalization and the study team developed an
intricate monitoring and intervention protocol that called for
specific steps when certain predefined clinical and RBV thresh-
old criteria were met. The study failed to yield positive results;
in fact, the use of RBV monitoring was associated with in-
creased morbidity and mortality.
Several manufacturers offer devices that allow for continuous
measurement of RBV during HD and therefore RBV monitoring
is frequently used to assist volume management during dialysis.
However, there is a paucity of data that associate attained intra-
dialytic RBV levels with outcomes, resulting in primarily empiri-
cal use of RBV monitoring. The goal of our research was to fill
this knowledge gap by exploring the association between attained
intradialytic RBV levels and all-cause mortality in a large and di-
verse HD population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population and study design
This multicenter observational retrospective study was con-
ducted in maintenance HD patients from 17 facilities of the
Renal Research Institute (RRI) across the USA between January
2012 and December 2016. The CLM was deployed to the RRI
dialysis clinics on a rolling basis and is the standard of care. A
6-month baseline period and an up to 54-month follow-up pe-
riod were defined on a patient level (Supplementary data,
Figure S1). We used the first treatment with eligible CLM data
as the start date of the baseline period. All patients who had at
least 10 eligible CLM recordings during the baseline period
were included in the study. A treatment time of <200 min was
the only exclusion criterion. Patient characteristics were
assessed during baseline. All-cause mortality was recorded dur-
ing follow-up. The New England Institutional Review Board
(#14-446) waived the need for informed consent.
RBV calculation
The RBV (expressed in percent of the blood volume at the
start of dialysis) at time t is calculated as follows:
RBV (%) at time t ¼ 100 � HCT0/HCTt.
HCT0 and HCTt are the hematocrits at the start and at a given
time t during HD, respectively. Hematocrit was measured
quasicontinuously using the CLM (Fresenius Medical Care
North America, Waltham, MA, USA). The CLM reports the
RBV once/min. The RBV data were electronically transferred to
an RRI data repository and the study database. Patients’ RBVs
were calculated per treatment and then averaged across all treat-
ments per patient and subsequently across patients. We used
RBVs at 1, 2 and 3 h into the HD session as outcome predictors.
To that end, we averaged the RBV data between minutes 50 and
70, 110 and 130 and 170 and 190, respectively.
Blood pressure measurement
In RRI clinics, blood pressure is automatically measured
every
30 min
oscillometrically.
We
calculated
average
predialysis, postdialysis and intradialytic systolic blood pressure
(SBP) and report nadir SBP and IDH rate; IDH was defined as
intradialytic SBP <90mmHg [16]. Intradialytic SBP during
baseline was available for 10 181 treatments in 219 patients.
Laboratory data
Laboratory measurements (Spectra Laboratories, Rockleigh,
NJ, USA) were downloaded to the RRI data warehouse and
extracted to the study database.
Comorbidities
Congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM) and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were docu-
mented using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, codes in the patients’ electronic health records.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics comprised means (6standard devia-
tion) for continuous variables and percentages for categorical
variables.
To explore the association between all-cause mortality and
RBV at 1, 2 and 3 h, we built Cox proportional hazards models
with spline terms, allowing us to model nonlinear effects of
RBV as a continuous variable and its relationship with all-cause
mortality at these three hourly time points. This spline analysis
allowed us to identify hourly RBV ranges associated with
hazard ratios (HRs) significantly <1 (‘favorable’) or >1 (‘unfa-
vorable’), respectively.
For additional analysis, we stratified patients into two groups
as those being within the ‘favorable’ 3-h RBV range or not.
Survival characteristics were compared using Kaplan–Meier
plots,
log-rank
tests
and
Cox
proportional
hazards
models. Minimally and fully adjusted Cox models comple-
mented the crude survival analysis. The minimally adjusted
model included age, sex, CHF and COPD. In addition, the fully
adjusted model included serum albumin and hemoglobin, the
neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR; an inflammatory marker
[17]), UFR, predialysis SBP, diabetes and race. Patients were
censored in the event of kidney transplantation, transfer to a
non-RRI facility, dialysis treatment modality change or end of
follow-up.
We also report baseline descriptive statistics, group differen-
ces and 95% confidence intervals in patients within or outside
the ‘favorable’ 3-h RBV range, respectively.
To further explore these findings and to account for possible
bias considering only 3 h and not the full treatment time, we ex-
amined the association between all-cause mortality and RBV by
relative elapsed treatment time, with total treatment time
defined as 100%. We used 25, 50, 75 and 100% of treatment
time elapsed by averaging the RBV between 21–30, 46–55, 71–
80 and 91–100% of the total treatment time, respectively.
Additionally, we also examined the association between
RBV slope and all-cause mortality. The RBV slope was com-
puted using simple linear regression with an intercept at 100%
RBV (per definition the initial RBV).
We also conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding patients
with RBVs below the favorable hourly RBV ranges.

RESULTS
Patient baseline characteristics
We studied 842 patients with a total of 28119 dialysis ses-
sions with eligible RBV recordings during a 6-month baseline,
resulting in 33.46 13.8 eligible sessions per patient (Table 1).
Age was 61.06 14.8 years, dialysis vintage was 3.9 6 4.1 years,
50.6% were white, 62.1% were male, 55.8% had diabetes, 24%
had CHF and 9.4% had COPD. Intradialytic RBVs were
97.96 1.9, 94.86 2.6 and 93.16 3.3% after 1, 2 and 3 h,
respectively.
Intradialytic RBV and all-cause mortality
During the median follow-up of 30.8 months, 249 patients
(29.6%) died. HRs for all-cause mortality were significantly
<1.0 in patients with 1-h RBV 93–96%, 2-h RBV 89–94% and
3-h RBV 86–92%. Approximately 65% of the patients attained
RBVs above, 32% within and �2.5% below these RBV ranges
(Table 2). RBV ranges associated with HRs significantly >1.0
were 97–100% (1 h), 95–99% (2 h) and 93–99% (3 h) (Figures 1
and 2). Half-hourly favorable RBV ranges are shown as supple-
mentary data (Supplementary data, Figure S2). Multivariate
Cox analysis corroborated the lower HRs for all-cause mortality
in those patients whose RBV fell inside these RBV ranges
(Table 3). Analysis by percent of elapsed treatment time instead
of by hours showed materially identical results (Supplementary
data, Figure S3). Subgroup analyses by median age (�/
>61 years), race (white, nonwhite), sex, pre-dialytic SBP (�/
>130mmHg) and IDWG (�/>2.3 kg) showed comparable fa-
vorable RBV ranges (Table 4).
Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards
models indicated a significantly better survival in patients with
3-h RBVs inside 86–92% compared with those patients outside
this range (Figures 3 and 4).
Analysis on the RBV slope and all-cause mortality showed
significantly increased HR, with a slope between �2.47 and
�0.34%/h, and significantly reduced HR with a slope from
�5.18 to �3.04%/h (Figure 5).

 Association between RBV, SBP and intradialytic
hypotension
Mean predialysis, postdialysis, intradialytic and nadir SBPs
were
146.3 6 20.1,
136.6 6 18.5,
135.3 6 19.0
and
116.2 6 19.0mmHg, respectively. Neither predialysis nor SBP
during dialysis differed between patients who did or did not at-
tain a 3-h RBV of 86–92%. Postdialysis SBP was significantly
higher in patients with RBV outside that range (Table 1,
Figure 6).
To explore if the peridialytic SBP behavior was associated
with specific RBV levels, we stratified patients based on

change (Supplementary data, Table S1).
To explore the association between RBV and intradialytic
SBP patterns we analyzed those 219 patients with available
intradialytic RBV and SPB data. Seventy-six patients (34.7%)
were inside the favorable 3-h RBV range and 143 (65.3%) were
outside. Neither intradialytic average SBP nor nadir SBP and
IDH rate differed between these two groups (Supplementary
data, Tables S2 and S3). Treatment-level hourly RBVs were
comparable between sessions with and without IDH, respec-
tively (Supplementary data, Table S4).
Intradialytic fluid administration
Acknowledging the possible influence of fluid administra-
tion on RBV, we examined hourly RBV levels in treatments
with documented fluid administration; hourly RBV levels were
materially
identical
(Supplementary
data,
Table
S5).
Furthermore, neither fluid administration rate nor fluid admin-
istration rate in the presence of IDH differed between patients
inside or outside the 86–92% 3-h RBV range, respectively
(Supplementary data, Table S3).
Sensitivity analyses
To explore the influence of RBV levels below the favorable
RBV ranges on outcomes, we computed HRs for all-cause mor-
tality after excluding patients with RBVs below the lower limits
of the hourly favorable RBV ranges. This sensitivity analysis
showed materially identical results (Supplementary data, Table
S6 and Figure S4).
To further explore the effect of intradialytic fluid administra-
tion on the association between RBV and all-cause mortality,
we performed sensitivity analyses in patients with available
intradialytic data. Cox proportional hazards models (crude,
minimally and fully adjusted models) excluding treatments
with fluid administration showed essentially identical results
(data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this study we explored the association between hourly intra-
dialytic RBV levels and all-cause mortality in a large and diverse
cohort of chronic HD patients. The main finding is that specific
intradialytic RBV ranges are associated with significantly lower
all-cause mortality.
Since the inception of dialysis, fluid management has been
of central concern. Fluid overload as well as fluid depletion
have been related to cardiovascular events and increased mor-
tality [3–5, 8, 18, 19]. Fluid management in standard in-center
HD has been likened to sailing between Scylla and Charybdis:
on the one hand, in patients without residual kidney function,
ultrafiltration is the only means to remove fluid accumulated
between HD treatments and to avoid fluid overload; on the
other hand, excessive fluid removal may impact intradialytic
hemodynamic stability. Indeed, ultrafiltration-induced blood
volume reduction is considered a causal factor of intradialytic
cardiovascular instability, depending on the rates of ultrafiltra-
tion and vascular refilling [6, 20]. Given these competing fac-
tors, it is conceivable that on a population level certain RBV
ranges are associated with lower (or higher) mortality. While
the genesis of the RBV curve is easy to understand qualitatively
as the relative difference between UFR and vascular refilling
rate, attempts to quantitatively model and predict RBV dynam-
ics are notoriously complicated and currently not applicable to
routine care [21, 22]. The matter is further complicated by the
absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the
relationship between RBV and patient outcomes. In this situa-
tion, clinical practitioners who use RBV monitoring resort to an
empirical assessment of RBV curves, where flat curves are

 considered to indicate fluid overload and steep curves
indicate intravascular volume depletion that may precipitate
IDH [23, 24].
This study is the first one to investigate the association be-
tween RBV levels attained in routine care and patient survival.
We are cognizant of the fact that causality cannot be derived
from observational studies and that this study cannot provide a
recommendation for certain RBV ranges. Only one RCT ex-
plored the clinical use of RBV monitoring. In the CLIMB Study
[15], 443 participants were randomized to either using RBV
monitoring as a voluntary adjunct to clinical care or conven-
tional care. Patients assigned to the intervention arm may have
had their UFRs adjusted at the discretion of the staff using a
suggested ultrafiltration algorithm when a pre-defined RBV tar-
get was reached. While RBV monitoring did not result in a
marked change in UFR, increased hospitalization and mortality
rates were noted in the intervention arm, calling into question
the utility of blood volume monitoring. Of note, the RBV tar-
gets used in CLIMB were, to the best of our knowledge, not
based on prior validated evidence [25].
In an observational study of 308 patients, Agarwal [26] used
relative plasma volume (RPV) recordings from a single HD
treatment to calculate RPV slopes. The author found that flatter
RPV slopes (<1.39%/h) were associated with higher mortality
(HR 1.72). After adjustment for several covariates, including
interdialytic blood pressure, flat RPV slopes remained a signifi-
cant predictor (HR 2.46). While it is difficult to compare these
RPV and our RBV results, their directional agreement is nota-
ble. In another observational study, Ficociello et al. reported a
64.5% lower all-cause hospitalization rate in patients with an
end-dialytic RBV <85% compared with patients with flat RBV
(abstract, National Kidney Foundation meeting, 2015).
RBV monitoring was introduced with the hope of prevent-
ing IDH [13, 14, 27, 28]. However, several studies failed to dem-
onstrate any relationship between changes in RBV and
intradialytic blood pressure [14, 29, 30]. Most studies intended
to find patient-specific RBVs associated with IDH, yet no criti-
cal RBV levels have been identified [11, 29]. These findings
were corroborated in our study where, in patients who attained
the favorable 3-h RBV range, IDH rates were not increased de-
spite higher UFRs.
In our study, about two-thirds of patients attained RBVs
above the favorable ranges and <3% of patients were below.
These results support reports where a substantial fraction
of patients had minor or no change in RBV during dialysis
[23, 31]. Lopot et al. [23] reported that in 30% of their patients
RBV did not decline, and Steuer et al. [31] reported an RBV re-
duction by <5 percentage points in 18% of their patients.
In our study, patients with a 3-h RBV above the upper limit
of the favorable range had clinical signs of fluid overload,
such as higher postdialysis SBP and a higher prevalence of CHF
(Table 1). While plausible, this observation needs corroboration
using objective measurements of fluid status, such as bioimpe-
dance (currently not available in the USA for use in patients).
Noteworthy, Agarwal [26] also concluded that flatter RBV
slopes were a sign of fluid overload, consistent with our
hypothesis.
Patients outside the favorable RBV range were older, had a
higher prevalence of CHF, lower enPCR and lower UFRs com-
pared with those patients within the favorable range. These
findings are consistent with studies showing lower ultrafiltra-
tion volumes and rates in elderly patients [32], possibly because
this group is particularly vulnerable to intradialytic morbid
events [14]. Older age predisposes to comorbidities, including
diabetes and CHF, which may prompt a more cautious ap-
proach to fluid removal. Therefore it cannot be excluded that
higher RBVs indicate intolerance to fluid removal, which may
explain in part the observed association with poor outcomes de-
spite extensive adjustment for confounders.
Our study has several strengths: its large and diverse dialysis
population, the substantial number of dialysis treatments, stan-
dardized care protocols, automated RBV and blood pressure
recordings and the long follow-up period. While observational
studies are ill-suited to guide general protocols for clinical prac-
tice, our results are valuable for the planning of future trials
designed to attain (or avoid) specific RBV levels, for example,
by using automatic UFR feedback control.
Study limitations are mainly due to its observational nature.
Objective indicators of fluid status (e.g. bioimpedance) are
missing; these would allow a more extensive probing into the
relationship between RBV and fluid status. Second, data were
incomplete for intradialytic blood pressure and for fluid admin-
istration and the dialysis staff was not blinded to RBV data.
Despite statistical adjustments for baseline characteristics, re-
sidual confounding cannot be ruled out. Lastly, we acknowledge
the lack of quantitative data on residual kidney function (RKF),
which could have an impact on RBV behavior. However, the
long HD vintage of our population makes substantial RKF un-
likely [33, 34]. Also, substantial RKF would result in less
IDWG, lower UFR and consequently flatter RBV curves. Since
RKF is associated with better survival, the presence of RKF
would have increased the odds for better outcomes with flatter
RBV, contrary to what we observed.
In conclusion, our study indicates that specific intradialytic
RBV ranges are associated with all-cause mortality in HD
patients. These findings may serve as a valuable basis for future
clinical trials into the relationship between RBV profiles, fluid
status as determined by objective methods and patient
outcomes.
