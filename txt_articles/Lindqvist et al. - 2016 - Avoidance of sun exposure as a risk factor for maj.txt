Avoidance of sun exposure as a risk factor for
major causes of death: a competing risk analysis
of the Melanoma in Southern Sweden cohort.
J Intern Med 2016; 280: 375–387.
Objective.
Women
with
active
sunlight
exposure
habits experience a lower mortality rate than
women who avoid sun exposure; however, they
are at an increased risk of skin cancer. We aimed to
explore the differences in main causes of death
according to sun exposure.
Methods. We assessed the differences in sun expo-
sure as a risk factor for all-cause mortality in a
competing
risk
scenario
for
29 518
Swedish
women in a prospective 20-year follow-up of the
Melanoma in Southern Sweden (MISS) cohort.
Women were recruited from 1990 to 1992 (aged
25–64 years at the start of the study). We obtained
detailed information at baseline on sun exposure
habits and potential confounders. The data were
analysed using modern survival statistics.
Results. Women with active sun exposure habits
were mainly at a lower risk of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and noncancer/non-CVD death as
compared to those who avoided sun exposure. As a
result of their increased survival, the relative
contribution of cancer death increased in these
women. Nonsmokers who avoided sun exposure
had a life expectancy similar to smokers in the
highest sun exposure group, indicating that avoid-
ance of sun exposure is a risk factor for death of a
similar magnitude as smoking. Compared to the
highest
sun
exposure
group,
life
expectancy
of avoiders of sun exposure was reduced by
0.6–2.1 years.
Conclusion.
The
longer
life
expectancy
amongst
women with active sun exposure habits was related
to a decrease in CVD and noncancer/non-CVD
mortality,
causing
the
relative
contribution
of
death due to cancer to increase.

Introduction
There is ongoing debate about whether avoidance
of sunlight or vitamin D deficiency is a major risk
factor for health. The findings of two recent reviews
on the impact of vitamin D were completely differ-
ent, with one showing that no firm conclusions
could be drawn [1] and the other demonstrating a
population attributable risk of death in the same
range as smoking, inactivity or obesity [2]. Studies
regarding sun exposure are rare, but recently, we
reported that the mortality rate was doubled in
women in the Melanoma in Southern Sweden
(MISS) cohort who avoided active sun exposure,
compared to those with the highest sun exposure
[3]. In addition, we found no differences in all-
cause or cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM)
mortality between those who expose themselves to
and those who avoid the sun.
Most
studies
have
analysed
the
relationship
between the upper extreme of sun exposure and
skin cancer and have showed an increased inci-
dence. Therefore, it is difficult to investigate sun

 exposure without taking skin cancer into consid-
eration. Skin cancer is usually divided into three
types according to increasing severity: basal cell
carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
and cutaneous MM. The two former are often
grouped as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC)
due to their similarity and generally nonfatal
prognosis. SCC is mostly related to cumulative
exposure to UV light, whilst UV light mainly
increases the risk of MM through episodic sunburn
and excessive exposure including frequent use of
tanning beds [4]. The incidence of MM in Sweden
has doubled during the last 15 years, whilst the
mortality rate has been constant since 1980s [5].
What causes the excess mortality amongst women
in the small subgroup (5.8%) who avoid sun
exposure is currently unknown. In this study, we
have classified mortality into three main cate-
gories,
death
due
to
cardiovascular
disease
(CVD), cancer and noncancer/non-CVD, and anal-
ysed all-cause death in a competing risk scenario.
The aim of this study was to determine how sun
exposure is related to these main causes of death.
Materials and methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Lund University (LU 632-03). The MISS study,
initiated in 1990, included approximately 1000
Sweden-born women of each age from 25 to
64 years (n = 39 973) who had no history of malig-
nancy. Subjects were selected from the general
population registry of the South Swedish Health
Care Region by random computerized selection
and represented 20% of the female population of
South Sweden at each age.
Women were invited to complete a standardized
written questionnaire concerning risk factors for
MM. The initial questionnaire was administered
from 1990 to 1992 and resulted in 29 518 women
participating in the study (response rate 74%). The
questionnaire was a detailed inquiry into several
factors of potential interest for mortality, such as
sun exposure habits, marital status, educational
level, smoking, alcohol consumption and the num-
ber of births. A total of 184 women emigrated
during the study period and were censored after
emigration. We collected information on mean
personalized family income between 1990 and
1993 from official income and taxation records at

Four
predetermined
questions were posed regarding sun exposure: (i)
How often do you sunbathe during the summer-
time? (never, 1�14 times, 15�30 times, >30 times);
(ii) Do you sunbathe during the winter, such as on
vacation
to
the
mountains?
(no,
1�3 days,
4�10 days, >10 days); (iii) Do you use tanning
beds? (never, 1�3 times per year, 4�10 times per
year, >10 times per year); and (iv) Do you go abroad
on vacation to swim and sunbathe? (never, once
every 1–2 years, once a year, two or more times per
year). The four questions were dichotomized into
yes/no in the analysis (i.e. sometimes versus no or
never). We created a four-score variable as a
measure of sun exposure depending on the num-
ber of ‘yes’ responses to the above questions on a
scale from 0 (avoid sun exposure: reference) to 4
(greatest sun exposure). Sun exposure habits were
categorized into three groups: zero ‘yes’ responses
(avoidance of sun exposure; the main study group);
‘yes’ responses to one or two questions (moderate
exposure); and ‘yes’ responses to three or four
questions (greatest exposure). Vital statistics and
cancer data were determined from the National
Population Register up to 1 January 2011. The
presence of skin cancer was recorded in the
following hierarchical order: MM, NMSC or no skin
cancer. Thus, a woman with NMSC was reclassified
to MM upon MM diagnosis.
With
regard
to
smoking
habits,
women
were
recorded as either smokers or nonsmokers at
baseline. As a measure of comorbid illness at the
start of the study, we created a dummy variable
termed ‘comorbidity’ to identify women who had
been treated with antidiabetic [Anatomical Thera-
peutic Chemical (ATC) classification system A : 10]
or anticoagulant (ATC B : 01) drugs or medication
for
CVD
(ATC
C : 01–C : 10)
for
more
than
1 month.
Age was categorized into 10-year intervals. For
comparison
of
ages,
approximately
50
and
60 years of age referred to women in the age
groups 45–54 and 55–64 years at the start of the
study. Data regarding BMI and physical exercise
were recorded at the second questionnaire in the
year 2000.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive
statistical
analysis
was
performed
using cross-tabulation with 95% confidence inter-
val (CI). Cox regression was performed to assess
all-cause mortality, as the dependent variable, with

 sun exposure, age, smoking, education, marital
status, disposable income and comorbidity as
independent
variables.
Subdistribution
Cox
regression analysis was performed to determine
whether avoidance of sun exposure is a risk factor
for CVD, cancer and noncancer/non-CVD. When a
specific death was used as the dependent variable,
the other two causes of death were censored, and
sun exposure and other confounders were intro-
duced as independent variables. In the final cause-
specific
regression,
we
included
comorbidity,
smoking, sun exposure, age, education, marital
status and disposable income. The subdistribution
hazard ratio (sHR) and 95% CI were used to
formally assess whether the resulting cumulative
incidence functions differed significantly by level of
sun exposure. Fine and Gray regression models
were used to estimate cause-specific cumulative
incidence functions for death due to cancer, CVD
and noncancer/non-CVD in the presence of com-
peting risks [6]. The model-based cause-specific
cumulative incidence functions were used to quan-
tify the absolute as well as the relative contribution
of each cause of death to all deaths (Fig. 1). The
competing risks regression models were adjusted
for the same potential confounding factors as the
cause-specific Cox regression models.
As a complement to the competing risk models, we
also quantified the loss in average life expectancy
over a 20-year observation period by estimating the
differences in restricted mean survival (RMS), that
is the area under the survival curve between two
time-points. This provides a measure of average
survival between exposure groups. We predicted
the RMS based on a flexible parametric survival

contribution to death by sun exposure habits (according to time in years since study inclusion).

 model that uses restricted cubic splines to model
the baseline hazard function [7]. Specifically, we
calculated the difference in RMS between the three
different sun exposure groups over a 20-year
follow-up period, adjusted for age at study inclu-
sion, comorbidities, disposable income and smok-
ing status. The results are presented for smokers
and nonsmokers of different ages who had a
previous record of comorbid conditions and a low
disposable income.
Both the Cox regression and Fine and Gray com-
peting risks analyses used time from inception as
the timescale. Time from inception was calculated
from inclusion to cause-specific death (cancer,
CVD and other causes), emigration or 1 January
2011, whichever occurred first.
IBM SPSS 21 (Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software
was used for descriptive analysis, and Stata 12
(Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for
the regression modelling. P-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Table 1 shows selected variables in relation to sun
exposure habits. It is clear that almost all these
variables vary significantly with sun exposure.
Subdistribution Cox regression analysis showed
that with CVD death as a dependent variable,
avoidance of sun exposure (yes/no) was related to
a 60% increased risk of death (sHR 1.6, 95% CI
1.3�2.0), and the relationship was ‘dose depen-
dent’ compared to the moderate and high sun
exposure groups: sHR 1.5 (95% CI 1.2�1.8) and
2.3 (95% CI 1.8�3.1), respectively. The corre-
sponding sHR values for death due to noncancer/
non-CVD were 1.7 (95% CI 1.4�2.1), 1.6 (95% CI
1.3�1.9) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.7�2.8) and due to
cancer were 1.2 (95% CI 0.98�1.4), 1.1 (95% CI
0.9�1.4) and 1.4 (95% CI 1.04�1.6), respectively.
The top three graphs in Fig. 1 show the cumulative
probability of death due to CVD, cancer and
noncancer/non-CVD by sun exposure group. The
three bottom graphs show the relative contribution
of CVD, cancer and noncancer/non-CVD to all-
cause mortality. The graphs clearly show that
when the risk of dying from CVD and noncancer/
non-CVD decreases, the relative proportion of
cancer deaths increases with more active sun
exposure habits, probably as a result of longer life
expectancy.
Figure 2 shows the age-dependent increase in the
probability of death 20 years after inclusion in the
study, categorized into the three main causes for
the three sun exposure groups, stratified by smok-
ing. The largest differences were seen amongst
smokers in all three mortality groups.
Differences in life expectancy depending on sun
exposure habits, stratified by smoking, are com-
pared in Fig. 3. Life expectancy was reduced in
nonsmokers of approximately 50 and 60 years of
age
who
avoided
sun
exposure
by
0.6
and
1.3 years, respectively, compared to those with
the highest sun exposure during the 20-year
follow-up. The same comparison amongst smokers
demonstrated a shorter life expectancy of 1.1 and
2.1 years, respectively. It can also be seen from the
graphs that nonsmokers who avoided sun expo-
sure had a similar life expectancy compared to
smokers with the highest sun exposure (Fig. 3).
Thus, avoidance of sun exposure seems to be a risk
factor of magnitude similar to smoking in terms of
life expectancy.

compared to moderate and high sun exposure
amongst those participants who answered the
second questionnaire including exercise and the
same independent variables as mentioned previ-
ously were 1.4 (95% CI 1.01�1.8) and 2.2 (95% CI
1.5�3.2) for CVD, 1.0 (95% CI 0.8�1.3) and 1.1
(95% CI 0.8�1.5) for cancer and 1.6 (95% CI
1.2�2.1)
and
2.1
(95%
CI
1.5�2.9)
for
non-
cancer/non-CVD mortality, respectively. Because
age is such a strong determinant of death, we also
introduced age as a continuous variable in model
2. The sHR estimates for moderate and high sun
exposure were 0.75 (95% CI 0.6�0.9) and 0.5 (95%
CI 0.4�0.6) for CVD and 0.7 (95% CI 0.6�0.9) and
0.6 (95% CI 0.4�0.7) for noncancer/non-CVD
mortality,
respectively.

0.8 (95% CI 0.6–1.2) and 0.7 (95% CI 0.4–1.2),
respectively.
In a 3 9 3 table, we present adjusted HRs for
combinations of skin cancer (no skin cancer/
NMSC/MM) and sun exposure groups (Table 3).
As compared to women who avoided sun exposure
without skin cancer (reference), those with MM
were at an increased risk of death. Women with the
most active sun exposure habits with NMSC were
at the lowest probability of death, that is the group
with
the
highest
life
expectancy.
The
HRs
decreased dose dependently in both non-MM and
MM groups with increasing sun exposure, with
fourfold lower HRs amongst those with the most
active sun exposure habits.
We also estimated the prevalence of other internal
cancers amongst women with NMSC (69/394;
17.5%) and those without skin cancer (3910/29,
124; 13.4%). Thus, women with NMSC had a 37%
higher prevalence of other internal cancers than
those without NMSC (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05�1.8)
and a fourfold increased prevalence of MM (OR 4.0,
95% CI 2.3�7.1). The incidence of other internal
cancer was not increased subsequently an NMSC
diagnosis.
Discussion
In this competing risk scenario, we determined that
the shorter life expectancy of women who avoided
sun exposure was mainly due to a dose-dependent
significantly increased risk of CVD and noncancer/
non-CVD deaths, as compared to the moderate and
high sun exposure groups. We conclusively showed

 that as the risk of dying in the CVD and non-
cancer/non-CVD groups decreased with increas-
ing sun exposure, the relative contribution of death
due to cancer increased, probably as a result of
extended life expectancy. Our finding that avoid-
ance of sun exposure was a risk factor for all-cause
death of the same magnitude as smoking is novel,
but in agreement with systematic reviews of vita-
min D and the risk of CVD [2]. The absolute
difference in life expectancy, however, differed by
age and smoking habits. For example, we esti-
mated that smokers at approximately 60 years of
age with the most active sun exposure habits had a
2-year longer life expectancy during the study
period as compared to smokers who avoid sun
exposure.
Strengths of our study include the unselected large
cohort of women and the long follow-up period. The
ability to demonstrate a dose-dependent relation-
ship between sun exposure and life expectancy was
also strength. Most previous studies have com-
pared the upper extreme of sun exposure to lower
levels, whereas we assessed the lower extreme of
sun exposure to higher levels. Answers to the
questionnaire do not necessarily provide a good
measure of low sun exposure at an individual level.
However, at the group level, we consider the data
valid.
We acknowledge several major limitations of this
study. First, it is not possible to differentiate
between active sun exposure habits and a healthy
lifestyle, and secondly, the results are of an obser-
vational nature; therefore, a causal link cannot be
proven. A further limitation is that we did not have
access to exercise data from study initiation;
however, similar sHR values were obtained when
including exercise for those women who answered
the second questionnaire in 2000. With the intro-
duction of whole-genome scanning, a new method
of getting closer to causality using observational
data is Mendelian random analysis. A potential
causal link between BMI and vitamin D levels has
been demonstrated with this method [8]. In addi-
tion, individuals with high BMI do not obtain the
same increase in vitamin D levels by UV radiation
as lean subjects [9]. As a consequence, as BMI
seems to be involved in the causal pathway of
vitamin D, it should not be included as a con-
founder in analyses as has been performed in
many studies.

 release [10]. Thus, sun exposure may affect sus-
ceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus by interfering
with the melatonin system. This might also explain
some of the differences in HbA1c levels by season
and the inverse relation between vitamin D and
incident type 2 diabetes mellitus [11, 12]. The
incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes mellitus has
been shown to depend on latitude, with the nadir
close to the equator [13]. A Finnish long-term
follow-up study showed approximately 80% lower
incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes mellitus
amongst those who received vitamin D supplemen-
tation during the first year of life, as compared to
no supplementation, adding to evidence of an
inverse relation between sun exposure/vitamin D
and incidental type 1 diabetes [14]. However, we
await the results of robust randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) to determine whether vitamin D
supplementation can lower the risk of type 1
diabetes mellitus [14]. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is
another immunopathological autoimmune condi-
tion with a positive association with latitude and
seasonal differences in incidence [15]. MS is char-
acterized by Th1 and Th17 expression. It has been
suggested that sun exposure lowers the risk of MS
and that vitamin D deficiency is related to an
increased frequency of relapse [15, 16].
The knowledge that 1, 25 vitamin D induces the
production
of
antimicrobial
peptides,
such
as
cathelicidin
and
b-defensin,
when
combating
infections has generated much research interest
[17]. One area of such research is the role of
vitamin D in respiratory tract infections. The
findings of RCTs of vitamin D supplementation
are not conclusive; some studies have shown a
protective effect against tuberculosis [17, 18] or
influenza [19, 20], whereas others did not find any
beneficial effects on respiratory tract infections
[21]. However, the latter study was conducted in a
population with a high level of vitamin D. Notably,
in
a
recent
RCT,
vitamin
D
supplementation
(4000 U/day) was found to reduce antibiotic con-
sumption by approximately 60% in patients with
primary immune deficiency [22]. In another study,
it was shown that patients >70 years of age given
vitamin D supplementation consumed less antibi-
otics (50% reduction) compared to the placebo
group [23]. Hypovitaminosis D (<50 nmol L�1) has
been reported to be an independent predictor of
nonresolution
of clostridium
difficile-associated
diarrhoea
[24].
Individuals
with
chronic
pul-
monary disease are reported to have significantly
more exacerbations in the presence of hypovita-
minosis D [25]. Vitamin D has immunoregulatory
properties, and vitamin D deficiency is associated
with poor immune function and increased disease
susceptibility [26–28]. Thus, there seem to be
several
plausible
mechanisms
for
the
inverse
relation between sun exposure and noncancer/
non-CVD death. However, most findings are from
studies that were observational in nature, and

 therefore, studies that can add causal evidence
are needed.
Possible mechanisms underlying the inverse dose-dependent relation
between CVD mortality and sun exposure
Already by 1981, Scragg had reported seasonal
differences in CVD incidence [29]. There is an
increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke
and both arterial and venous thromboembolism in
winter as compared to summer in countries far from
the equator [30–33]. In addition, venous throm-
boembolism has been reported to be less common
amongst those with active sun exposure habits [32].
In comparing vitamin D levels, a Danish study
showed an inverse dose–response relation between
vitamin D levels and venous thromboembolism [34],
whereas two other studies found no effect of con-
centration [35, 36]. In two well-executed systematic
reviews, low vitamin D levels were related to both
CVD incidence and CVD mortality [37, 38].
Hypertension is a major determinant of CVD.
Observational data support the notion that lack
of UVB radiation is involved in the pathogenesis of
hypertension and CVD by (i) suppression of the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, (ii) a direct
effect
on endothelial cells
and (iii) effects
on
calcium metabolism [39]. A lack of either UVB or
UVA light produced a short-term reduction in
blood pressure [40, 41]. Solar UVA radiation may
also produce systemic NO with a sustained reduc-
tion in blood pressure and has been suggested to
act in a cardioprotective manner [42].
Both high acute and chronic stress levels have a
role in the activation of coagulation and may
increase the risk of CVD [43, 44]. The finding that
UV
radiation
induces
b-endorphin
synthesis,
which may attenuate stress levels and have a
cardioprotective
effect,
is
interesting
[45].
An
inborn internal reward system for sun exposure
indicates that UV exposure is important for health.
Further,
the
differences
in
skin
pigmentation
depending on regional UV radiation indicate the
presence
of
strong
evolutionary
mechanisms.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease
with cardiovascular dysfunction including myocar-
dial
infarction,
stroke
and
thromboembolism.
There are a related increase in angiotensin II and
a decrease in NO. Thus, sun exposure might lower
the risk of arteriosclerosis, possibly by stabilizing
arteriosclerotic
plaque,
which
in
turn
would
decrease CVD risk.
NMSC as a measure of sun exposure
In a large study in which the presence of BCC was
used as a proxy for sun exposure, Lindel€
of et al.
[46] demonstrated a 37% higher risk of internal
cancers amongst survivors of BCC and a 4.9-fold
increased risk of MM (i.e. prevalence data). How-
ever, our prospective cohort provides access to
both incidence and prevalence data. We found
almost identical prevalence data amongst women
with NMSC (a 37% and 4-fold increased prevalence
of internal cancers and MM, respectively). How-
ever, the incidence of other subsequent internal
cancer was not increased. If women survive by not
dying from CVD or noncancer/non-CVD causes,
they will have a higher probability of being diag-
nosed with cancer. Thus, even if paradoxical, our
findings and those of Lindel€
of et al. [46] are almost
identical,
only
the
interpretations
differ.
Most
studies have investigated the effects of the upper
extremes of sun exposure (over exposure) and have
shown increased incidences of MM and NMSC. We
have investigated the lower extremes of sun expo-
sure (under exposure) and found that the HRs for
all-cause mortality increased 4-fold in both NMSC
and MM groups amongst avoiders of sun exposure
as compared to the highest sun exposure group. In
addition, women with NMSC and the highest sun
exposure had the longest life expectancy. This
finding is in agreement with several previous
reports. Newton-Bishop and coworkers reported
improved prognosis of MM by increasing vitamin D
levels [47], Jensen and coworkers showed a 9%
increase in 10-year survival of individuals with
BCC [48], and Yang and coworkers reported 20% to
30% lower mortality amongst those reporting at
least 1 week of sunbathing per year [49]. Thus, it
seems that sun exposure causes an increased
incidence of NMSC and MM, but not a decrease in
life expectancy. Thus, when analysing factors that
affect life expectancy, such as sun exposure, (i)
results
from
case–control
and
cross-sectional
(prevalence) studies must be interpreted with cau-
tion and (ii) not only should the incidence of NMSC
or MM be reported, but also data on all-cause risk
of death should also be provided.
Guidelines
Our findings indicate that UV exposure might have
opposing effects on different health issues. There-
fore, national guidelines should be based on care-
ful weighing of both hazards and benefits. Indeed,
it might not be beneficial to promote restrictive
P. G. Lindqvist et al.
Sun exposure and all-cause death
384

 year-round sun exposure advice in a country like
Sweden, where the maximum UV index is low (<3)
for 8–9 months of the year. During the summer,
the midday UV index peak might reach 3–5, but
rarely high (≥6). The UV level will reach at least
high (≥6) UV index all year around in Northern
Australia. Further, because there is no robust
evidence to show that it is safe in terms of MM to
be exposed to the sun for longer after applying
sunblocker, we question the general interpretation
of the guideline that ‘as long as you use sunblock
you may stay out in the sun for a long time’. An
intriguing explanation for the rising MM incidence
in Sweden is that the restrictive sun exposure
advice that urges reliance on sunscreen use has
resulted in overexposure, which is a major risk
factor for MM. More importantly, strong recom-
mendation
to
avoid
sun
exposure
may
have
increased the risk of CVD and noncancer/non-
CVD morbidity and death in the Swedish popula-
tion. Greater focus on this risk might help in
generating causal data.
Whether the positive effect of sun exposure demon-
strated in this observational study is mediated by
vitamin D, another mechanism related to UV
radiation, or by unmeasured bias cannot be deter-
mined from our results. Vitamin D levels might be
just a marker of sun exposure. Moreover, suppos-
edly, it is not vitamin D levels per se, but the
avoidance of vitamin D deficiency that is important
[50]. Thus, adding vitamin D in a population at low
risk of vitamin D deficiency is unlikely to be
beneficial [50]. RCTs employing an adequate dose
and duration of supplementation are needed. For
example, when the supplemented dose of vitamin
D in Finland decreased, the protective association
with type 1 diabetes mellitus in childhood and
adolescence decreased [14].
We
conclude
that
the
excess
mortality
rate
amongst those who avoid sun exposure was mainly
due to an increased risk of death due to CVD and
noncancer/non-CVD. The increased life expec-
tancy of women with active sun exposure habits
will increase the proportion of cancer deaths. Our
findings add to the ongoing debate regarding the
nonskeletal effects of sunshine/vitamin D.
