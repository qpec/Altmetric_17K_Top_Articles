Abstract
It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout learning to avoid 
runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational 
considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals learn, 
and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6,920 synapses in mouse motor and 
sensory cortices using 3D-electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% 
after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of 
scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. 
Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more 
plastic synapses (~80%) and stronger, more stable synapses. These results support the hypothesis 
that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.
The cerebral cortex in humans contains 16 billion neurons, and in mice 14 million neurons 
(1), and each neuron harbors thousands of synapses (2). Of the billions of cortical synapses 
of adult mice, ~80% are excitatory and the majority of these are on dendritic spines (3). 
Spine size is tightly correlated with synaptic strength (3, 4): the area of the postsynaptic 
density (PSD), the area of the axon-spine interface (ASI), and the volume of the spine head 
(HV) are strongly correlated among themselves and with the number of vesicles in the

 presynapse (5–8), the number of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPAR (9)), and the amplitude 
of AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents (10, 11).
Changes in synaptic strength are the primary mechanisms mediating learning and memory 
(12, 13). Synaptic potentiation and depression must be balanced to avoid either saturation or 
obliteration of neural signaling and memory traces (14), and it is usually assumed that 
overall synaptic strength is regulated throughout learning (15). The synaptic homeostasis 
hypothesis (SHY) (16) argues, however, that owing to energy and signaling requirements, 
learning should occur primarily through synaptic potentiation during wake, leading to a net 
increase in synaptic strength. This is because sparsely firing neurons can ensure that 
coincidences in their inputs learned during wake are signaled throughout the brain only if the 
connections relaying such coincidences are strengthened, not weakened. Overall synaptic 
renormalization by net weakening should occur during sleep, when animals are disconnected 
from the environment. The reason is that spontaneous neural activity can sample memories 
in a comprehensive and fair manner only if the brain is offline, without being at the mercy of 
current environmental inputs. Sleep can thus promote the acquisition, consolidation and 
integration of new information, as well as restore cellular function (16, 17).
Because stronger synapses are larger and weaker ones smaller (3, 4), SHY makes an 
intriguing prediction: Billions of cortical excitatory synapses should increase in size after 
wake and decrease after sleep, independent of circadian time. Furthermore, although 
synaptic renormalization should affect a majority of synapses, it should also be selective, to 
allow for both stability and plasticity (16–18).
We used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) (19) to obtain direct, high-
resolution 3D volume measurements of synaptic size during the wake/sleep cycle and across 
thousands of synapses in two regions of mouse cortex. Brains were collected from 3 groups 
of mice (4 mice/group; Fig.1A): S (sleep) mice spent at least 75% of the first ~7h of the light 
period asleep, EW (enforced wake) mice were kept awake during that time by exposure to 
novel objects, and SW (spontaneous wake) mice spent at least 70% of the first ~7h of the 
dark period spontaneously awake (Fig.1B). S mice were compared to both SW and EW 
mice, to tease apart sleep/wake effects from potential confounding factors due to time of 
day, light exposure, and stimulation/stress associated with enforced wake. In each mouse we 
sampled layer 2 of primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortices. In these 
areas and layers activity-dependent structural plasticity is well documented (3). Blocks of 
cortical tissue (~25×25×13–25µm) were acquired, automatically aligned, and spiny dendritic 
segments were randomly selected within each block, balanced in size across groups 
(diameter = 0.86 ± 0.23 µm, mean ± std; Table S1), and manually segmented by trained 
annotators blind to experimental condition (Fig.1C,D; Methods). Within each dendritic 
segment all protrusions (also called “spines” (3)) were annotated, including spines forming 
synapses and a minority that lacked synapses (~13% of all protrusions; Table S1). Across all 
mice, 168 dendritic segments were segmented (101 in M1; 67 in S1; Fig.1D, Fig.S1), for a 
total of 8,427 spines, of which 7,149 formed a synapse. Synapses were defined by the 
presence of a presynaptic bouton with at least 2 synaptic vesicles within a 50 nm distance 
from the cellular membrane facing the spine, a visible synaptic cleft, and a PSD. In spines 
forming a synapse, ASI, HV, as well as vesicles, tubules and multivesicular bodies (MVBs)

 that together form the non-smooth endoplasmic reticulum (non-SER) compartment (20), and 
the spine apparatus were segmented (Fig.1E,F) (see Methods). After excluding incomplete 
synapses, 6,920 spines with a synapse contributed to the final analysis (Tables S1, S2).
ASI and PSD are strongly correlated with each other and both become larger after synaptic 
potentiation (6–8). We focused on ASI - the surface of direct contact between axonal bouton 
and spine - as a structural measure of synaptic strength because in SBEM images its exact 
borders are easier to identify than those of the PSD (21). First, we asked whether ASI sizes 
change as a function of wake and sleep using a linear mixed effects model that included 
mouse and dendrite as random effects, condition (SW, EW, S) and brain region (S1, M1) as 
categorical fixed effects, and dendrite diameter as a linear fixed effect. Condition had a 
strong effect on ASI (χ2 = 10.159, df = 2, p = 0.0062), which did not interact with either 
brain region or dendrite diameter. Post-hoc analysis (adjusted for multiple comparisons) 
found that ASI sizes after sleep were reduced on average by 18.9% relative to spontaneous 
wake (p = 0.001), and by 17.5% compared to enforced wake (p = 0.003; Fig.2A; see 
Methods, LME Model for ASI). Spontaneous and enforced wake did not differ (SW vs. EW, 
−1.7%; p = 0.957). Thus, ASI sizes decrease with sleep on average by ~18% relative to both 
spontaneous and enforced wake, independent of time of day. There was instead no difference 
across groups in the distribution of dendrite (p = 0.248) and mitochondrial (p = 0.445) 
diameters, ruling out overall tissue shrinkage after sleep (Fig. S2).
Consistent with the range of PSD and spine sizes in mouse somatosensory and auditory 
cortex (22, 23), the distribution of ASI sizes in our S1 and M1 samples was log-normal (Fig.
2B), a feature thought to emerge from multiplicative dynamics (22). On the log scale the S 
group showed an overall shift to the left relative to the SW and EW groups, suggesting that 
the decrease in ASI during sleep obeyed a scaling relationship (Fig.2B, inset; 2C). Formal 
testing (see Methods) confirmed scaling when sleep was compared to either spontaneous 
wake (average scaling −20.1%, p = 0.784) or enforced wake (average scaling −19.1%, p= 
0.648). Monte Carlo simulations on bootstrapped data (see Methods) suggested that the 
change in ASI sizes between wake and sleep is not consistent with uniform scaling across all 
synapses, but rather with selective scaling, where a fraction of all synapses scales and the 
remaining portion does not. Of the models tested, the best fit was provided when the 
likelihood of scaling decreased quadratically with increasing ASI size (Fig.2D). This model 
fitted the actual data best assuming that a majority of all synapses (>80%) would scale and a 
minority (<20%) would be less likely to do so (Fig.2D).
Do morphological features of synapses predict the likelihood of scaling? Given the results in 
Fig. 2D, we asked whether distinguishing between small-medium synapses (bottom 80%) 
vs. large synapses would predict scaling vs. not-scaling. This distinction based on size was 
significant (p = 0.009; small ASI; S vs. SW −11.9%, p = 0.0002; S vs. EW −12.5%, p = 
0.0001; large ASI; S vs. SW +0.7%, p = 0.999; S vs. EW +2.0% p = 0.994) (Fig.3A) and 
robust for scaling fractions around 80% (see Methods). In summary, these results indicate 
that the ASIs of most synapses decrease during sleep in a manner proportional to their size, 
and that the largest 20% of spines are less likely to scale.

 Plastic changes may preferentially occur in spines that contain recycling endosomes (24), 
whose presence reflects increased turnover of membranes, glutamate receptors and other 
proteins that are essential to support activity-dependent structural changes (13, 24, 25). 
Indeed, only spines containing vesicles, tubules and multivesicular bodies (MVBs), most of 
which are considered of endosomal origin (20), showed significant scaling (p = 0.00003; 
vesicles/tubules +; S vs. SW −25.0%, p = 0.00001; S vs. EW −20.9%, p = 0.0008; vesicles/
tubules −; S vs. SW −2.9%, p = 0.985; S vs. EW −2.8% p = 0.989) (Fig.3B,C).
A spine’s structural plasticity may be constrained by the overall spine density of its dendritic 
branch (26). Although synaptic density by itself was unaffected by wake and sleep (p = 
0.761), it interacted with the effect of sleep on ASI (p = 0.038): the ASI decrease with sleep 
was largest in less spiny dendrites (S vs. SW = −36.4%; S vs. EW = −25.3%) and smallest in 
dendrites with higher synaptic density (S vs. SW = 7.8%; S vs. EW = −8.2%) (Fig.3D).
By contrast, ASI decreased with sleep both in the spines with a spine apparatus (27) - a 
specialization of SER involved in calcium regulation and synthesis of transmembrane 
proteins - and in those without it (28) (Fig.3E). While spines facing an axonal bouton with 
one or more mitochondria were larger than spines lacking an axonal mitochondrion, scaling 
again occurred in both groups of spines (Fig.3F). In summary, ASI size scales down between 
wake and sleep in small and medium sized synapses (~80% of the total population), but is 
less likely to do so in synapses that are large (~20%) or in spines that contain no endosomes, 
and it is less marked in highly spiny dendrites.
Because HV is also strongly correlated with synaptic strength, we investigated changes in 
HV as a function of wake and sleep using a linear model that included the same random and 
fixed effects as for ASI (see Methods, LME Model for HV). Results were consistent with 
those with ASI (χ2 = 6.942, df = 2, p = 0.031), with one additional interaction (condition × 
dendrite diameter): HV decreased most in the largest dendrites (S vs. SW = −31.8%; S vs. 
EW = −38.4%) and least in the smallest dendrites (S vs. SW = −4.7%; S vs. EW = 1.3%) 
(Fig.S3A,B). Like ASIs, HVs followed a log-normal distribution (Fig.S3C) and as a group, 
only the spines with vesicles, tubules and MVBs showed a significant downscaling in HV 
after sleep at an average value of dendrite diameter (vesicles/tubules +: S vs. SW = −20.8%, 
p = 0.0006; S vs. EW = −14.3%, p = 0.045; vesicles/tubules -: S vs. SW = 6.4%, p = 0.776; 
S vs. EW = 1.3%, p = 0.999) (Fig.S3D,E).
The ultrastructural demonstration of up- and downscaling of synapse sizes with wake and 
sleep supports the hypothesis that wake leads to a net increase in synaptic strength, whereas 
a core function of sleep is to renormalize synaptic strength through a net decrease (16). 
Ultrastructural analysis provides the morphological ground truth, but it is necessarily limited 
to small brain samples. However, synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle is likely to be 
a general phenomenon, irrespective of species, brain region, and specific plasticity 
mechanisms (16). Here we found similar changes in two different cortical regions. 
Moreover, protein levels of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors are higher after wake than 
after sleep (29) across the entire cerebral cortex. Also, the number of immuno-labeled 
synaptic puncta increases with enriched wake and decreases with sleep in widespread

 regions of the fly brain (30). Finally, electrophysiological markers of synaptic efficacy also 
increase broadly after wake and decrease after sleep (16).
The scaling of synaptic size is not uniform, consistent with the requirement that learning 
during wake must potentiate synapses selectively, and with the hypothesis that selective 
renormalization during sleep favors memory consolidation, integration, and ‘smart’ 
forgetting (16). We do not know how scaling is apportioned between wake and sleep. During 
wake there may be a selective upscaling of a smaller proportion of synapses, because 
learning is limited to a particular environment (31); whereas downscaling during sleep may 
be broader, because the brain can sample its memories comprehensively and fairly when it is 
offline (16). We also cannot rule out that a few synapses may upscale in sleep (16, 17). 
Future studies labeling individual plastic events in the same synapses over wake and sleep 
may shed light on this issue. It will also be important to assess which molecular mechanisms 
are involved in the selective scaling of excitatory synapses in wake and sleep, and to evaluate 
possible changes in inhibitory synapses (32).
Finally, we found that the synapses that most likely escape scaling are those that are large, 
those that lack endosomes, as well as those in crowded dendritic branches. These features 
may represent structural markers (besides molecular markers (33)) of synapses and 
associated memory circuits that are either committed or relatively stable despite the 
profound daily remodeling. We do not know, however, to what extent and over which time 
scale synapses may switch between this smaller pool of stronger, more stable synapses and 
the larger pool of weaker, more plastic synapses. An intriguing question is whether the 
subset of strong and stable synapses may originate preferentially from neurons at the top of 
the log-normal distribution of firing rates (34), whose level of activity seems to remain stable 
when the environment changes (35), or perhaps from neurons located in a specific layer (2/3 
or 5).

dendrites with the lowest synaptic density (range: 0.17–1.24/µm2); at the average value of 
synaptic density (vertical line; 0.70/µm2), the mean overall decrease is −17.3% (S vs. SW 
−17.4%, p = 0.002; S vs. EW −17.3%, p = 0.002). E,F, ASI size declines in sleep 
independent of the presence of spine apparatus (asterisk) or mitochondria in the axonal 
bouton (arrowheads). Scale bars = 500 nm. Note that in all experimental groups, spines 
containing a spine apparatus or facing an axonal bouton with mitochondria are larger than 
spines lacking these elements. ** p< 0.01; *** p< 0.001.
