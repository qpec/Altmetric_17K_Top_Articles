ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To ascertain long term cardiovascular outcomes in 
patients whose chest pain remained undiagnosed six 
months after first presentation.
Design
Cohort study.
setting
UK electronic health record database (CALIBER) linking 
primary care, secondary care, coronary registry, and 
death registry information.
PartiCiPants
172 180 adults aged ≥18 from 223 general practices 
presenting with a first episode of recorded chest pain, 
classified from medical records as diagnosed (non-
coronary condition or angina) or undiagnosed (cause 
unattributed) at first consultation between 2002 and 
2009 and with no previous record of cardiovascular 
disease.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events over 5.5 years’ 
follow-up. Adjustments were made for age, sex, 
deprivation, body mass index, smoking status, year of 
index presentation, and previous records of diabetes 
or hypertension or previous prescriptions for lipid 
lowering drugs.
results
At the index presentation, 72.4% of patients (124 688) 
did not have a cause attributed for their chest pain; 
118 687 (95.2%) of these did not receive any type of 
cardiovascular diagnosis over the next six months. 
Only a minority of patients in all three groups 
(non-coronary 2.0% (769 of 39 232); unattributed 
11.7% (14 582 of 124 688); angina 31.5% (2606 of 
8260)) had a recorded cardiac diagnostic investigation 
in the first six months after presentation. The long term 
incidence of cardiovascular events was higher in those 
whose chest pain remained unattributed after six 
months (5126 of 109 628; 4.7%) compared with 
patients with an initial diagnosis of non-coronary pain 
(1073 of 36 097; 3.0%) (adjusted hazard ratios for 0.5-1 
year after presentation: 1.95, 95% confidence interval 
1.66 to 2.31; for 1-3 years: 1.35, 1.23 to 1.48); for 3-5.5 
years: 1.21, 1.08 to 1.37). Owing to the larger number of 
patients in the unattributed group, there were more 
excess myocardial infarctions in the long term in this 
group (214 more than expected based on the rate in 
the non-coronary group) than in the angina group (132 
more than expected). Patients who had cardiac 
diagnostic investigations in the first six months had a 
higher long term risk of cardiovascular events, 
regardless of the initial chest pain label. Incidence of 
unattributed chest pain and angina decreased 
between 2002 (124 per 10 000 person years and 13 per 
10 000 person years, respectively) and 2009 (107 per 
10 000 person years and 5 per 10 000 person years, 
respectively), but the incidence of chest pain 
attributed to a non-coronary cause remained stable 
(37-40 per 10 000 person years). Risk of cardiovascular 
events did not change over time.
COnClusiOns
Most patients with first onset chest pain do not have a 
diagnosis recorded at presentation or in the 
subsequent six months, including those who undergo 
cardiac investigations. These patients have an 
increased risk of cardiovascular events for at least five 
years. Efforts to better assess and reduce the 
cardiovascular risk of such patients are warranted.
Introduction
Each year 1-2% of adults in the UK attend primary care 
with chest pain symptoms for the first time.1-3  The dom-
inant concern is that these patients may have treatable 
coronary disease. At the first consultation general prac-
titioners may diagnose myocardial infarction, angina, 
or a non-coronary cause, such as gastro-oesophageal or 
musculoskeletal disease or anxiety. Most often the GP 
will record only the symptom at this stage and not attri-
bute it to any specific cause,1 
2 
4 while pursuing investi-
gations in those for whom coronary heart disease is 
considered a diagnostic possibility.
Cardiovascular disease will be diagnosed in 2-10% of 
patients in the unattributed group within 12 months, 
most within 6-12 weeks of that first presentation.2 
4  Risk 
factors for future cardiovascular events are more 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Chest pain in primary care is a common diagnostic challenge with potentially 
serious consequences if cardiovascular disease is missed
Most patients presenting with new chest pain in primary care do not have a specific 
diagnosis recorded
Several primary care studies show that people presenting with new chest pain and 
no diagnosis recorded have a higher risk of a cardiovascular event at one year than 
those with no chest pain
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Most people who present with unattributed chest pain have no diagnosis recorded 
over the next six months and do not undergo diagnostic testing
Patients whose chest pain remains unattributed for six months have higher long 
term risk of major cardiovascular events than those with an initial non-coronary 
diagnosis for their chest pain
Because of their numbers, patients with unattributed chest pain after six months 
have the most myocardial infarctions in the long term and should be targeted for 
better assessment and cardiovascular disease prevention

prevalent in this group than among patients without 
chest pain.4  Patients in the general population who 
report chest pain and those attending specialist chest 
pain clinics who are told that they do not have a cardiac 
cause of their chest pain have a higher future incidence 
of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease than pain-
free populations.5 6 Thus, the symptom of chest pain 
seems to be a marker of cardiovascular risk.
Two important questions remain unanswered. 
Firstly, do patients who still have unattributed chest 
pain after an initial period to resolve diagnostic uncer-
tainty have an increased risk of long term fatal and 
non-fatal cardiovascular events compared with patients 
diagnosed as having non-coronary chest pain? No study 
has investigated cardiovascular outcomes in patients 
with chest pain who remain without a diagnosis of car-
diovascular disease, after allowing time for further 
assessment and short term increases in clinical mani-
festations of underlying disease. Thus, whether the ini-
tial GP diagnosis and investigation provides enough 
information about disease status to warrant long term 
monitoring, is unclear.
Secondly, has improved access to diagnostic proce-
dures (such as the introduction of rapid access chest 
pain clinics) and the observed decrease in the popula-
tion incidence of coronary heart disease7 8 led to 
changes in diagnostic labelling and prognosis of chest 
pain in primary care? This has not been previously 
investigated.
We sought to tackle these questions by studying 
patients with no record of previous cardiovascular dis-
ease, who consulted and were recorded with first onset 
of chest pain in UK primary care but were not given an 
immediate diagnosis of myocardial infarction. We used 
primary care electronic health records linked to hospi-
tal, disease registry, and cause specific mortality 
records to obtain a more complete and accurate evalua-
tion of major cardiovascular disease endpoints.
Methods
setting
The study was set in the CALIBER (cardiovascular dis-
ease research using linked bespoke studies and elec-
tronic health records) research programme. CALIBER 
links primary care data from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink (CPRD) to the national registry of 
acute coronary syndromes (Myocardial Ischaemia 
National Audit Project, MINAP), inpatient diagnoses 
and procedures from Hospital Episode Statistics, and 
cause specific mortality from the Office for National Sta-
tistics.9  The CPRD is representative of the UK popula-
tion in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and 
overall mortality.10-13  We have previously demonstrated 
the validity of CALIBER data for a wide range of cardio-
vascular risk factors across a variety of incident cardio-
vascular events.14-17 A description of the CALIBER 
approach and phenotyping algorithms combining 
Read, ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 
10th revision), and drug and procedure codes to define 
risk factors and endpoints are available at www.caliber-
research.org.
study population
The study population was all patients in the database 
aged 18 or over with a first (incident) coded record of 
chest pain (denoted as chest pain with cause unat-
tributed, chest pain attributed to non-coronary cause, 
or angina) in primary or secondary care between 2002 
and 2009. We excluded those with a record of angina or 
cardiovascular disease before their first recorded pre-
sentation of chest pain in that period or with less than 
two years of up-to-standard quality data in the CPRD at 
the time of their first chest pain event. The first record of 
chest pain was defined as the index presentation.
Definitions of chest pain at index presentation
We identified Read and ICD-10 symptom codes (avail-
able from www.keele.ac.uk/mrr) through consensus 
work to define unattributed chest pain (for example, 
codes for “chest pain not otherwise specified” or “tight 
chest pain” without clearly specifying a cause of the 
pain) and non-coronary chest pain (specific attribution 
to organ systems other than cardiovascular, such as 
“chest pain oesophagitis”). Read codes record morbid-
ity in UK primary care;18  ICD10 codes record morbidity 
in secondary care.19 Angina was defined by Read or ICD-
10 codes for angina or at least two prescriptions for 
nitrates.
alternative explanations for chest pain
We looked for recorded potential alternative explana-
tions for chest pain in the 24 months before index pre-
sentation with a prevalence of at least 1% in the study 
population. These were oesophageal reflux, anxiety, 
depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
chest infection, asthma, osteoarthritis, spinal pain, and 
cancer. Morbidities were defined using Read and ICD-10 
morbidity codes previously developed in CALIBER or 
through consensus work at Keele University.
baseline cardiovascular risk factors
We assessed baseline covariates (age at index presenta-
tion, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, 
neighbourhood deprivation, prescriptions for lipid low-
ering drugs, and specific comorbidities) for their associ-
ation with type of recorded chest pain and as potential 
confounders for the relation between type of chest pain 
and future cardiovascular disease. BMI and smoking 
were defined as the closest recorded value before the 
index date. Deprivation was based on the English index 
of multiple deprivation 2007 (IMD)20 linked to patient 
postcode, with patients grouped by fifths. The IMD is a 
weighted aggregate for the local neighbourhood (mean 
population 1500) of deprivation across seven domains: 
income; employment; health deprivation and disabil-
ity; education, skills, and training; barriers to housing 
and services; living environment; and crime. We identi-
fied prescriptions for lipid lowering drugs in the 24 
months before the index date. Diabetes and hyperten-
sion were included as known risk factors for cardiovas-
cular disease and identified as recorded diagnoses in 
primary or secondary care in the 24 months before the 
index presentation.

investigations and interventions after index 
presentation
We determined the prevalence of cardiac diagnostic 
investigations (coronary angiography (invasive, com-
puted tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), 
echocardiography (stress, exercise, and resting), and 
myocardial perfusion scans) in the first six months after 
the index date. As a measure of clinical intervention to 
reduce risk of future cardiovascular disease, we identi-
fied prescriptions for lipid lowering, hypertension, and 
diabetic drugs in the six months after the index presen-
tation up to the first cardiovascular episode or six 
months, whichever was earlier. Prescriptions for 
nitrates were not included because they were used to 
define angina and were regarded as treating a symptom 
rather than reducing risk.
Outcomes
We assessed two primary outcomes from index presen-
tation to a maximum follow-up of 5.5 years: incident 
myocardial infarction (fatal or non-fatal) in all patients 
and any recorded first fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular 
event in patients with unattributed or non-coronary 
chest pain. We identified cardiovascular events in the 
“diagnostic window” of the first six months after index 
presentation; the next five years was the period of 
observation for the long term outcomes, which are the 
main focus of this paper.
Cardiovascular events were defined as: fatal or 
non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, angina, coronary 
heart disease not otherwise specified, heart failure, 
ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, ischaemic 
stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, stroke type not specified, 
transient ischaemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, 
abdominal aortic aneurysm, sudden cardiac death, per-
cutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery 
bypass graft surgery. We identified these from primary 
and secondary care records, MINAP, and the ONS death 
registry, using previously derived algorithms in 
 
CALIBER.9  We included all cardiovascular events, 
rather than just those that may initially present with 
chest pain, as management of people with definite or 
possible coronary heart disease includes treatments 
such as statins or hypertension drugs, which may 
reduce such events (for example, stroke). This is consis-
tent with recommendations to manage cardiovascular 
disease as a single family of diseases.21
statistical analysis
We compared the prevalence of baseline cardiovascular 
risk factors in the three index groups (unattributed 
chest pain, non-coronary chest pain, and angina) using 
multinomial logistic regression, further adjusting for 
year of index presentation and stratifying by age (<65 or 
≥65 years). We determined the percentage of patients in 
each group with a potential alternative explanation for 
their chest pain.
We compared the incidence of cardiovascular events 
between groups in two ways. First we derived Kaplan-
Meier curves and crude incidence rates from index pre-
sentation to 5.5 years. These, therefore, include events 
during the initial six month diagnostic period as well as 
long term outcomes.
Our second, and main, analysis determined the inci-
dence of cardiovascular events in those not diagnosed 
as having cardiovascular disease in the first six 
months—that is, the long term prognosis from six 
months to 5.5 years. Analysis in the unattributed and 
non-coronary groups was restricted to those with no 
cardiovascular diagnosis or recorded angina in the first 
six months and with follow-up data that included at 
least the first six months. We used Cox proportional 
hazards regression to determine the risk of long term 
cardiovascular event by type of chest pain at baseline, 
adjusting for baseline covariates and year of index pre-
sentation. Analysis for the outcome of myocardial 
infarction included those who presented initially with 
angina but had no other cardiovascular event in the 
first six months.
The proportional hazards assumption was assessed 
using Schoenfeld residuals and deemed adequate for 
the outcome of myocardial infarction. However, for the 
outcome of any cardiovascular event, the assumption 
seemed to be violated, so the follow-up time was split 
into three periods: six months to one year after initial 
presentation (all patients), one to three years after ini-
tial presentation (in those with no cardiovascular event 
by one year of follow-up), and three to 5.5 years after the 
index presentation (in those with no cardiovascular 
event after three years of follow-up). This seemed to 
give a better model fit than including a (linear) interac-
tion with time or splitting at other time points. Patients 
were censored by death, end of follow-up period, or end 
of records in CALIBER.
We repeated the main analysis in the subgroup of 
patients who had no record of diagnostic investigations 
within the first six months.
Finally, we calculated the incidence of new presenta-
tions of chest pain for each year from 2002 to 2009. The 
denominator population for each year was the regis-
tered population with at least two previous years of 
up-to-standard quality data. Annual total incidence 
rates were directly standardised by applying incidence 
rates to the age-sex general population structure of 
England in 2009. However, as this made little difference 
to the incidence figures, we used crude rates to compare 
across time.
Robust variance estimators were used in all multi-
variable analyses, accounting for clustering within gen-
eral practices. We conducted sensitivity analyses for 
missing data on the baseline covariates. Analysis was 
performed using SPSS v.21 and Stata/MP 13.0 for 
 
Windows.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.

Results
The denominator population ranged from 1 158 755 in 
2002 to 1 417 211 in 2009. Of these, 172 180 patients from 
223 general practices fulfilled the inclusion criteria 
between 2002 and 2009, with a mean age of 49.0 (SD 
17
.59). On index presentation, chest pain was recorded 
as unattributed in 124 688 patients (72.4%), as non-cor-
onary in 39 232 (22.8%), and as angina in 8260 (4.8%). 
The index presentation was recorded in primary care 
for 93.5% (160 911) of patients—39 114 in the non-coro-
nary group (99.7%), 115 602 in the unattributed group 
(92.7%), and 6195 in the group with angina (75.0%). 
baseline cardiovascular risk factors
Fewer than 20% of the patients with new recorded unat-
tributed or non-coronary chest pain were aged over 
65 (10 258 and 6379 patients, respectively), compared 
with 58.5% (4828) of patients with new angina (table 1 ). 
Being male, having previously recorded hypertension, 
and obesity were associated with unattributed chest 
pain and with angina rather than with non-coronary 
chest pain on the index date (see appendix table 1 in 
supplementary files online). The percentage of patients 
with potential alternative explanations for their chest 
pain in their medical records was generally similar 
between groups (table 1).
Fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and any 
cardiovascular event during follow-up
The median length of follow-up in patients initially 
recorded with unattributed or non-coronary chest pain 
(n=163 920) was 3.3 years (interquartile range 1.6-5.4). At 
least six months’ follow-up was available for 151 317 
(92.3%) patients, and 40 010 (24.4%) patients had the 
full 5.5 years of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves (fig 1) 
show higher rates of cardiovascular events in the initial 
six month period than after the six month period and in 
those with unattributed compared with non-coronary 
chest pain across the full 5.5 years of follow-up. 
Median times to first cardiovascular event were 135 
days (interquartile range 22-664) for patients with unat-
tributed chest pain and 665 (248-1165) days for those 
with non-coronary chest pain. Rates of cardiovascular 
events were higher in the unattributed group (292 per 
10 000 person years) than in those in the non-coronary 
group (107 per 10 000 person years) (see appendix table 
2). Patients with unattributed chest pain also had a 
higher rate of myocardial infarction (46 per 10 000 per-
son years) than those with non-coronary chest pain (17 
per 10 000 person years) but a lower rate than for those 
initially recorded with angina (244 per 10 000 person 
years). Because of the higher number of patients with 
initially unattributed chest pain, two thirds of myocar-
dial infarctions were in this group (1850 of 2726, 67
.9%). 
Risk of cardiovascular disease was not statistically sig-
nificantly different by year of index presentation.
short term follow-up
In the first six months after the index date, 2.0% (769) of 
those recorded with non-coronary chest pain (39 232) 
and 11.7% (14 582) of those with unattributed chest pain 
(124 668) had a diagnostic investigation (fig 2), com-
pared with 31.5% (2606) of those recorded with angina 
(8260). Cardiovascular events were recorded in 4.8% 
(6001) of those with unattributed chest pain and 0.7% 
(268) of those with initial non-coronary chest pain. 
Myocardial infarction was recorded in 4.6% (383) of 
those with initially recorded angina, 0.7% (862) of those 
with unattributed chest pain, and 0.1% (39) of those 
with non-coronary pain.
long term outcomes
Of the 115 014 patients with unattributed chest pain who 
were followed up for at least six months, 109 628 (95.3%) 
remained without a cardiovascular diagnosis at six 
months (fig 2 , table 2). Myocardial infarction rate from 
0.5 to 5.5 years was highest in the angina group (hazard

higher for the unattributed group (1.36, 1.16 to 1.60) com-
pared with the non-coronary group. Owing to the large 
number of people in the unattributed group, more 
excess myocardial infarctions occurred from 0.5 to 5.5 
years in the unattributed group than in the angina group 
(214 v 132), when comparing age and sex specific rates of 
myocardial infarctions to the non-coronary group.
Risk of long term cardiovascular disease was signifi-
cantly higher over the whole long term follow-up 
period in patients with initially unattributed chest 
pain, compared with patients who had a diagnosis of 
non-coronary pain (0.5-1 year: adjusted hazard ratio 
1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.66 to 2.31; 3-5.5 years: 
1.21, 1.08 to 1.37). Most cardiovascular events took 
place in the large unattributed group and represented 
a 43% excess over expected numbers based on the 
non-coronary group rate.
The risk of cardiovascular disease in the long term 
was higher in patients with a diagnostic investigation in 
the first six months than in those without, regardless of 
their initial diagnosis (253 per 10 000 person years v 149 
per 10 000 for those in the initially unattributed group). 
Of those with no diagnostic investigation in the first six 
months, the unattributed group had a higher long term 
risk of a cardiovascular event (149 per 10 000 person 
years) than the non-coronary group (100 per 10 000 
(table 2).

early intervention after the index consultation
In the six months after the index consultation, and 
before any cardiovascular event during this period, the 
proportion of people prescribed lipid lowering, hyper-
tension, or diabetes drugs was 18.3% (7193 of 39 232) 
and 26.3% (32 812 of 124 688) in the non-coronary and 
unattributed groups, respectively. These figures were 
similar in the subgroup without a recorded cardiovas-
cular event in the first six months (18.1% (6543 of 36 097) 
v 24.9% (27 338 of 109 628)) and higher in those without 
a recorded event who had undergone cardiac 
 
investigations (40.1% (261 of 651) v 42.1% (4563 of 
10832)) (table 3).
incidence of recorded chest pain
Incidence of recorded unattributed chest pain 
decreased from 124 per 10 000 person years in 2002 to 
107 per 10 000 in 2009. Incidence of recorded angina 
decreased from 13 per 10 000 person years to 5 per 
10 000 over the same period (fig 3). Annual incidence of 
recorded non-coronary chest pain remained relatively 
stable (37-40 per 10 000). These trends were apparent 
across both sexes and all age groups (see appendix fig-
ure 1). The percentage of all patients with a new record 
of chest pain who were coded with angina decreased 
from 7
.8% (1594 of 20 478) in 2002 to 3.6% (767 of 21 049) 
in 2009.
discussion
Most patients presenting with a new episode of chest 
pain in primary care did not have their pain attributed 
to a specific cause by the recording GP, and these 
patients had a higher rate of subsequent cardiovascular 
events than those whose chest pain was attributed to a 
non-coronary cause. Six months later most patients 
with unattributed chest pain had not undergone diag-
nostic investigations, had not received drugs that might 
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and had not 
experienced a cardiovascular event. For the first time, 
we have shown that patients in this group have a higher 
long term incidence of any cardiovascular event and of 
fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction than those ini-
tially diagnosed as having non-coronary chest pain, for 
up to five years. Rates of myocardial infarction were 
highest during this period in those who were initially 
diagnosed as having angina, but the number of patients 
with myocardial infarction was highest in the group 
who had remained undiagnosed at six months because 
of the total number of people in this group. Prognostic 
models are needed to identify the patients most at risk, 
so they can be targeted with specific treatment and life-
style advice directed at reducing the risk of life threat-
ening cardiovascular events.
We found a decline in incidence of unattributed chest 
pain and of angina from 2002 to 2009. The trend 
occurred in all age groups, indicating that it was not 
caused by changes in coding practices or a cohort 
effect. These patterns reflect declines in the incidence of 
cardiovascular disease noted elsewhere and are consis-
tent with unattributed chest pain being a disease 
marker with important prognostic correlates.7

the incidence of chest pain attributed to a specific 
non-coronary diagnosis was stable during this period, 
indicating that GPs are correctly diagnosing patients at 
low risk of cardiovascular events. The prognostic rela-
tion with cardiovascular outcomes did not change 
across the index years (2002-09), however, suggesting 
that diagnostic practice and treatment did not change 
substantially in these years.
Comparison with other studies
Our findings are presented in the context of previous 
evidence about the prognosis of patients with chest 
pain presenting in primary care.1-4 22 23  They confirm 
that angina is a minority diagnosis compared with 
unattributed chest pain.2 4 24  They also confirm that a 
diagnosis of non-coronary chest pain correctly identi-
fies a low risk group.24 Our study is novel in investigat-
ing what happens subsequently to patients whose chest 
pain remains undiagnosed in the first six months after 
presentation, and we have shown that the initial cate-
gorisation is related to future myocardial infarction and 
to any cardiovascular event for up to five years regard-
less of whether a diagnostic investigation was per-
formed, reflecting the long term prognostic importance 
of the initial diagnosis.
implications
Our findings were robust to multiple adjustments for 
baseline differences between the three diagnostic 
groups. Their importance lies in the large number of 
patients in whom chest pain was unattributed, account-
ing for more myocardial infarctions during follow-up 
than patients with a diagnosis of angina, although inci-
dence rates were substantially lower. Implications for 
clinical practice might include prevention treatment for 
all patients with unattributed chest pain, even though 
most will not go on to experience a cardiovascular 
event. Another option, favoured by Robson et al,4 would 
be to target patients with unattributed chest pain for 
more detailed prognostic characterisation to identify 
those at greatest risk more precisely.
GPs will vary in the proportion and type of patients 
whose chest pain they attribute to specific causes. We 
did not assess this variability, although our analyses 
took into account the clustering of patients in practices. 
Some GPs may intentionally not record an immediate 
cardiovascular diagnosis, preferring to wait until diag-
nosis is confirmed. However, this would not affect our 
main finding of increased long term risk in those still 
without a diagnosis after six months. The initial classi-
fication of patients as having angina or non-coronary 
disease identified the groups at highest and lowest risk 
of future events up to 5.5 years. The decision of the GP to 
do cardiac investigations identified patients more likely 
to have or to develop cardiovascular problems, even 
those given a non-coronary diagnosis for their chest 
pain. Higher proportions of these patients were taking 
cardioprotective drugs than those not undergoing 
investigations. 
The “unattributable” label at initial presentation 
might represent the clinician’s diagnostic uncertainty 
or their decision to delay formal registration of coronary 
heart disease until investigations have been completed. 
Investigations are more likely to be recorded in this 
group than in the non-coronary group and are more 
likely to identify a subgroup at risk of developing car-
diovascular problems. Another message for clinical 
practice is that patients with chest pain who are investi-
gated but do not have a cardiac disease diagnosed 
remain at higher risk of future events than those not 
referred for investigation, confirming results from an 
earlier study of referrals to chest pain clinic.6 This fur-
ther supports our conclusion that development of prog-
nostic models could help clinical decision making in 
primary care to identify which patients with chest pain 
would benefit from early cardiac investigation and 
which would benefit from preventive treatments.

Our study shows that initial GP classification of 
patients with new onset chest pain reflects the likeli-
hood of both underlying current cardiovascular disease 
and long term risk for future disease. Future research 
should investigate whether more patients could be 
placed confidently into the group with initial non-coro-
nary pain, given the low absolute risk of cardiovascular 
disease in this group. A systematic review of diagnostic 
indicators of non-cardiovascular chest pain identified 
several ways in which GP diagnosis of these syndromes 
might be improved; many patients with unattributed 
chest pain might be reclassified as definitely having 
non-coronary chest pain.25  Methods to improve diagno-
sis of coronary heart disease in patients with chest pain 
would be useful, but clinical algorithms, computerised 
decision support systems, imaging, and biomarkers 
have met with variable success in improving the clinical 
judgment of GPs.4 26-31  Moreover, the evidence shows 
that patients “ruled out” of a coronary heart disease 
diagnosis by these methods remain at increased risk of 
future cardiovascular events.6
An alternate aim of research would be to improve 
estimation of prognosis in patients with unattributed 
chest pain and to identify which patients are at highest 
risk of future cardiovascular disease. Interventions and 
investigations could then be targeted efficiently and 
effectively. Such research needs to build on existing 
healthcare information and risk calculators,4  new bio-
markers,32  and development and validation of prognos-
tic models, as has been done for patients with stable 
angina.33 Improving and testing prognostic estimation 
in this large group of patients in primary care could, 
given the excess numbers who progress to preventable 
cardiovascular events, potentially have substantial 
impact on population health.
strengths and limitations of this study
A strength of our study was the large cohort developed 
within a national (UK) primary care database with 
linked hospital, myocardial infarction, and death regis-
try data. Estimates of the annual incidence of chest pain 
over the eight years of the study (15-18 per 1000 person 
years) were comparable to those from previous analyses 
of general practice data in the UK.1-4 The main limita-
tion, in common with other primary care studies based 
on routinely collected data, is the lack of specific infor-
mation on the results of diagnostic testing and the pos-
sibility that we have missed testing that was recorded 
only in secondary care. Although some data were miss-
ing for some cardiovascular risk factors, analyses using 
complete cases and analyses using multiple imputation 
(not shown) delivered similar findings.
Conclusion
The large group of patients with undiagnosed chest 
pain in primary care generally do not undergo diagnos-
tic testing but have an increased risk of fatal and non-fa-
tal cardiovascular events for at least five years. More 
needs to be done to improve the assessment of chest 
pain in this group and reduce the cardiovascular risk of 
such patients.
