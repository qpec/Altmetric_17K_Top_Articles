 Objective—To examine the effect of intensive blood pressure (BP) control on changes in gait 
speed and mobility status.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Randomized, controlled trial of hypertensive individuals 
aged 75 years or older without a history of diabetes or stroke, who participated in the Systolic 
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).
Interventions—Participants were randomized to a systolic BP target of <120 mmHg (intensive-
treatment, N=1,317) versus <140 mmHg (standard-treatment, N=1,319).
Main Outcomes and Measures—Gait speed was measured using a 4 meter walk test. Self-
reported information concerning mobility was obtained from items on the Veterans Rand 12 Item 
Health Survey (VR-12) and the EQ-5D. Mobility limitation was defined as a gait speed <0.6 m/s 
(1.34 mph) or self-reported limitations in walking and climbing stairs.
Results—Among 2,636 participants (mean age 79.9 years; 37.9% women), median follow-up 
was 3 years. There was no difference in mean gait speed decline between the intensive-treatment 
and standard-treatment groups (mean difference = 0.000 m/s per year, 95% CI: -0.005 to 0.005, 
p=0.876). There was no evidence of any treatment group differences in subgroups defined by age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, baseline BP, chronic kidney disease, or a history of cardiovascular disease. 
There was a modest interaction by VR-12 Physical Component Summary Score, although the 
effect did not reach statistical significance in either subgroup: mean differences of 0.004 m/s per 
year (95% CI: -0.002 to 0.010) and -0.008 m/s per year (95% CI: -0.016 to 0.001) among those 
with scores ≥40 and <40, respectively (p=0.027 for interaction). Multi-state models, allowing for 
the competing risk of death, demonstrated no effect of intensive treatment on transitions to 
mobility limitation (hazard ratio: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.22).
Conclusions and Relevance—Among adults age 75 years or older in SPRINT, treating to a 
systolic BP target <120 mm Hg, compared with a target of <140 mm Hg, had no effect on changes 
in gait speed, and was not associated with changes in mobility limitation.
Trial Registration—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01206062
Introduction
Results from The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) indicate that 
targeting a systolic blood pressure (BP) <120 mmHg confers benefits on cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality in hypertensive adults aged ≥ 50 years free of diabetes and stroke.1 
This benefit was apparent in adults 75 years or older and, in exploratory analyses, also 
among persons with frailty or slow gait speed.2 A critical direction for SPRINT is to 
evaluate the balance between this benefit and other health consequences of intensive BP 
control.3 This is especially true for adults 75 years of age or older, where it has been 
estimated that 5.8 million adults in this age range would meet the SPRINT eligibility 
criteria.4 Physical functioning during the course of the trial has yet to be reported.
Gait speed is a well-established physical function measure predictive of adverse health 
outcomes and mortality.5,6 Decline in gait speed may be an early harbinger of decline in 
physical function, the development of disability, and loss of independence.7 Observational 
evidence suggests a faster rate of gait speed decline among older adults with high BP. 8 In

 contrast, some evidence suggests that among very old adults, lower systolic BP is associated 
with greater limitations on activities of daily living and greater probability of worsening 
disability.9 There have been no large-scale randomized controlled trials of BP control that 
have reported on gait speed as an outcome.
Here we compare the trajectory of gait speed decline and incident mobility limitation in the 
intensive-treatment and standard-treatment groups in SPRINT, within the subgroup of 
participants 75 years or older at the time of randomization. The findings of this study will 
help inform our understanding of the effect of intensive BP control on the net balance of 
health outcomes in older adults with hypertension.
Methods
Population
The design, eligibility, and baseline characteristics of SPRINT have been described 
previously.10 Of 9,361 participants randomized to an intensive SBP target of <120 mm Hg 
or a standard target of <140 mm Hg, 2,636 were 75 years or older. The characteristics of 
participants in this subgroup by treatment group have been previously described.2 The only 
statistically significant treatment group differences at baseline were a higher frequency of 
aspirin use (62.3% versus 58.0%) and higher prevalence of frailty, as assessed by a 37-item 
frailty index,11 (33.4% versus 28.4%) in the intensive-treatment group.
Study Measurements
Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at baseline. Race/ethnicity was 
collected by self-report. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters, squared. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 
calculated by the 4-variable Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.12 
Physical and mental health-related quality of life were assessed using the Veterans RAND 
12 item Health Survey (VR-12).13 The VR-12 is summarized via a Physical and Mental 
Component Summary Score (PCS and MCS respectively); for each a score of 50 represents 
the U.S. population mean, 10 points represent one standard deviation, and higher scores 
denote better quality of life (QOL).14
Gait speed measurements
Gait speed was measured at the time of randomization and annually thereafter via a timed 4-
meter walk performed twice at the participant's usual pace from a standing start. The use of a 
walking assistive device was permitted if typically used by the participant to walk short 
distances. The faster of the two gait speeds in meters/second (m/s) was used in this analysis. 
Gait speeds slower than 0.20 m/s and faster than 2.0 m/s were set to missing (n=22).
Self-reported mobility
We considered two self-reported questions concerning mobility from QOL instruments 
administered at baseline and then annually thereafter. From the VR-12,13 we considered the 
question, “Does your health now limit you in climbing several flights of stairs?”, with 
responses of “Yes, Limited A Lot”, “Yes, Limited A Little”, or “No, Not Limited At All”.

 We also considered the mobility question from the EQ-5D,15 with responses of “I have no 
problems in walking about”, “I have some problems in walking about”, or “I am confined to 
bed”. Mobility limitation was defined as A) having a gait speed below 0.6 m/s 16 OR B) 
reporting a lot of difficulty climbing stairs, AND C) reporting some difficulty walking about 
or being confined to bed [A or (B and C)]. As a secondary approach, we examined models 
that defined mobility limitation based solely on gait speed (<0.6 m/s). Because gait speed 
based on a 4 meter walk test entails measurement error, we required that any changes in gait 
speed were ≥0.127 m/s (the 95% confidence limit for an estimated minimal detectable 
change17) in order to define a transition between mobility status for models defining 
mobility limitation based solely on gait speed. For example, if a participant's gait speed at 
baseline was 0.650 m/s, their gait speed would need to decrease to <0.523 m/s at a 
subsequent visit in order to be classified as having developed a mobility limitation.
Duration of Follow-up
The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) accepted the Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board recommendation to stop the SPRINT intervention on August 
20th, 2015. In order to maximize the number of follow-up assessments for gait speed, we 
included study visits through December 1st, 2015. Our analysis includes 527 gait speed 
assessments during a period where participants were transitioning to having their BP 
managed by their primary care provider. Comparing BPs in the 103 day period from 
8/20/2015 to 12/1/2015 to BPs measured in the 103 days prior to 8/20/2015, the mean 
systolic BP increased slightly in both treatment groups, from 133.6 to 135.5 mm Hg in the 
standard-treatment group and from 118.4 to 121.3 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group. 
However, the mean systolic BP difference only decreased by approximately 1 mm Hg during 
this transition period, from 15.2 mm Hg (95% CI: 14.6 to 15.8 mm Hg) to 14.1 mm Hg 
(95% CI: 13.5 to 14.7 mm Hg).
Statistical Analysis
Linear mixed-effect models, assuming linear decline, were used to compare longitudinal 
trajectories for gait speed between the treatment groups. The models included nested random 
effects (participants within clinic site), to address within-subject correlations due to repeated 
assessments and correlations between participants at the same clinical site. We included a 
time by randomization group interaction term to test if the change in gait speed differed 
between the treatment groups. The mixed models were fit using SAS v9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC). 
We tested for interaction between treatment group and the following subgroups: age (<80 
years versus 80 years and older), sex, race (black versus non-black), baseline systolic BP (< 
140 mmHg, 140-159 mmHg, ≥ 160 mmHg), and presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD, 
eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2), history of cardiovascular disease, and VR-12 PCS (≥40 versus 
<40).
Sensitivity Analyses—We conducted two sensitivity analyses for the models of change 
in gait speed. We used multiple imputation techniques to infer missing gait speed 
measurements, using the same mixed model framework described above. Details about the 
multiple imputation procedure are described in the Supplementary Material. Second, we

 censored gait speed measures at the time of the NHLBI Director decision to stop the 
SPRINT intervention.
Multi-State Modeling—We examined transitions in mobility status using a multi-state 
model as shown in Figure 1; this method accounts for the competing risk of death. Mobility 
limitation was defined based on gait speed and self-reported limitation in walking and 
climbing stairs, as described above. The model included three states: alive with no mobility-
limitation, alive with a mobility-limitation, and death. We conducted a secondary analysis of 
mobility limitation defined by gait speed alone as described above. The multi-state models 
were fit using the mstate package for the R Statistical Computing Environment.18,19
Results
Among 2,636 randomized participants aged 75 years or older, 2,629 (99.7%) had 
information on mobility at baseline. (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) In defining 
mobility status at baseline, 2,541 participants had gait speed measured, while mobility status 
was based solely on self-report in an additional 88 participants. Of these, 464 (17.6%) were 
classified as having a mobility limitation at baseline, with similar frequencies in the 
intensive-treatment (N = 233/1,313, 17.8%) and standard-treatment (N=231/1,316, 17.6%) 
groups. Participants with a mobility limitation were older, and more likely to be female and 
not white. They had higher BMI and albumin to creatinine ratio, and lower eGFR than 
participants without a mobility limitation. Participants with a mobility limitation were using 
more antihypertensive agents and were more likely to use aspirin at baseline.
The mean gait speed at baseline was 0.91 m/s (2.04 mph) with a mean annual change of 
-0.026 m/s (95% CI: -0.028 to -0.023). The trajectory of gait speed appeared similar among 
participants in the intensive and standard treatment groups. (Figure 2) There was no 
difference in mean gait speed decline between participants randomized to intensive-
treatment and those randomized to standard-treatment (mean difference= 0.000 m/s per year, 
95% CI: -0.005 to 0.005, p-value for difference=0.879). (Table 2) The change in gait speed 
among intensive-treatment and standard-treatment groups did not differ significantly for 
subgroups defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline systolic BP, chronic kidney disease, 
or history of cardiovascular disease (Table 2). The effect of intensive treatment on change in 
gait speed was modestly more beneficial among those with higher VR-12 Physical 
Component Summary Scores, although the effect on change in gait speed did not reach 
statistical significance in either group: mean differences of 0.004 m/s (95% CI: -0.002 to 
0.010) and -0.008 m/s (95% CI: -0.016 to 0.001) among those with scores ≥40 and <40, 
respectively. The proportion of missing data for gait speed appeared similar between the 
intensive-treatment and standard-treatment groups and ranged from <5% at baseline to 
approximately 20% at 36 and 48 months (Supplementary Table 1). The proportion of 
missing data over time was greater among those with a mobility limitation at baseline than 
those without a mobility limitation (Supplementary Table 2). Multiple imputation of missing 
gait speed measures did not alter the results. The difference in mean gait speed decline per 
year between the intensive-treatment group and the standard-treatment group was -0.000 
(95% CI: -0.005 to 0.005 m/s, p-value =0.983) after imputation. Censoring follow-up at the 
time of the decision to stop the SPRINT intervention also did not impact the results; the

 difference in mean gait speed decline per year was also 0.000 (95% CI: -0.006 to 0.005 m/s, 
p-value for difference=0.931).
The mean transition rate from no mobility limitation to mobility limitation was 12.5 per 100 
person-years. Transitions from no mobility limitation to mobility limitation and vice versa 
did not differ in the intensive treatment and standard treatment groups. (Table 3) There was 
no effect of intensive treatment on transitions to mobility limitation (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.91 
to 1.22) or on transitions from mobility limitation to no mobility limitation (HR: 0.92, 95% 
CI: 0.77, 1.10). Participants in the intensive treatment group with no mobility limitation had 
a lower risk of death than those in the standard treatment group (HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43 to 
0.90). Findings were unchanged when we restricted the definition of mobility limitation to 
only consider clinically relevant changes in gait speed, though the effect of intensive BP 
control on mortality (from a state of no mobility limitation) was no longer statistically 
significant.
Discussion
Among adults age 75 years or older in SPRINT, there were no differences in gait speed 
decline among those in the intensive-treatment versus standard-treatment groups. In both 
groups, the mean rate gait speed decline was approximately 0.08 m/s (0.18 mph) over 3 
years. Additionally, intensive treatment was not associated with changes in mobility 
limitation compared with standard treatment. These findings were robust to statistical 
attempts to account for missing data and the competing risk of death. The effect of intensive 
blood pressure lowering on change in gait speed was consistent across subgroups defined by 
age, sex, race, systolic BP, history of CKD, history of CVD, although there was modest 
evidence of a differential effect by physical QOL.
SPRINT is the first large-scale randomized controlled trial of BP control to report results 
concerning gait speed as an outcome. Our findings are consistent with findings from the 
Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), which found no significant 
differences in change in function in basic, moderate, or advanced activities of daily living 
(ADL).20 However, a subsequent paper demonstrated that the presence of missing data may 
have biased the findings against a benefit of the treatment group.21 Additionally, 
investigators from the SHEP trial found a modest benefit of treatment on self-reported 
evening walks, considered a leisure time activity in the SHEP questionnaire.20 The ongoing 
INtensive versus Standard Ambulatory Blood Pressure Lowering to Prevent Functional 
DeclINe In The ElderlY (INFINITY) trial may provide additional insight regarding the role 
of ambulatory BP control on mobility outcomes.22
Observational evidence on the effect of BP on gait speed is mixed, although the majority 
points towards an association of higher BP and worse gait function among older adults. In 
the Cardiovascular Health Study, participants with a BP of >140/90 mmHg had a faster rate 
of decline in gait speed than those without.8 In the LIFE-Pilot trial, investigators found that 
wider pulse pressure was associated with slower gait.23 A small study of older adults found 
that adults with hypertension had worse gait function parameters, although not slower gait 
speed.24 It has been hypothesized that worsening gait and functional performance may be

 due to increased white matter hyperintensities among individuals with hypertension. 
Investigators in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study found that 
white matter hyperintensities among specific regions were associated with slower gait.25 
However, some evidence suggests the opposite relationship may exist among the very old. 
Investigators from the Leiden-85+ study found higher systolic BP was associated with less 
worsening of ADLs compared with lower BP.9 However limitations in ADLs are likely to be 
downstream of changes in mobility status, so these conflicting findings may be due to the 
evaluation of the role of BP at differing stages of the disablement process.
We found modest evidence of an interaction by physical QOL, such that among those with 
better physical QOL, intensive BP lowering appeared to be associated with a slower rate of 
decline in gait speed; whereas among those with worse physical QOL, intensive BP lowering 
appeared to be associated with faster decline in gait speed. It is possible that those with 
preserved physical QOL may gain additional benefit from intensive treatment. However, 
these findings should be interpreted with caution as the effect size was modest and did not 
reach statistical significance in either group. Further research is needed to determine if there 
are factors that can differentiate the populations for whom intensive BP treatment may slow 
or accelerate gait speed decline.
There are several possible explanations for why intensive treatment did not substantially 
impact gait speed or mobility outcomes in SPRINT participants 75 years or older, or in the 
majority of subgroups examined. Gait speed incorporates function across multiple domains 
including cardiorespiratory fitness, musculoskeletal health, vision, balance, and even mood/
psychosocial health,5,16 so it is possible that the cardiovascular benefit conferred from 
intensive BP control did not extend to mobility outcomes due to the multifactorial nature of 
mobility. The heart failure literature presents a similar conundrum in that the optimal therapy 
can differ for the outcomes of survival and exercise capacity; medications that confer a 
survival benefit, such as beta-adrenergic blockers, can negatively impact exercise 
capacity.26,27Additionally, physical functioning is affected by a lifetime of exposures, so it is 
possible that the intervention was not long enough to significantly impact mobility.
SPRINT participants aged 75 years and older had an average decline in gait speed of 
approximately 0.08 m/s over 3 years. A pooled analysis of the association of gait speed and 
survival found a 12% lower risk of mortality per 0.1 m/s increment of gait speed,5 indicating 
that the change observed in SPRINT is clinically relevant. The gait speed decline observed 
in SPRINT is similar to other populations of older adults. In the Cardiovascular Health 
Study, a study of community dwelling adults aged 65 years and older at baseline, gait speed 
declined a median of -0.2 m/s over 9 years,28 or approximately 0.022 m/s per year. In Health 
ABC, the estimated change in gait speed over 4 years was 0.10 m/s or a decline of 0.025 m/s 
per year.29 The mean annual decline in gait speed for participants aged 75-79 in the 
InCHIANTI study was 0.036 m/s per year for women and 0.034 for men.30
Our study has a number of limitations. SPRINT excluded individuals with a history of 
diabetes or stroke, symptomatic heart failure, or an indication for a specific BP lowering 
medication, so our findings may not be applicable to populations with these conditions. 
SPRINT also excluded individuals with orthostatic hypotension or dementia, and did not

 enroll elderly persons living in nursing homes. The large majority of SPRINT participants 
were already treated with BP medication; therefore our results do not address the impact of 
initiating BP therapy. Additionally, the clinic staff that performed gait speed assessments 
were not blinded to treatment assignment. There was a modest amount of missing data, 
although this appeared evenly distributed across treatment groups and the results were 
unchanged when we used multiple imputation. Furthermore, the results were similar when 
we used gait speed alone as an outcome, or mobility limitation which included self-reported 
data. Finally, SPRINT was stopped early owing to a significantly lower rate of the primary 
composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group, so we are not able to look at the long 
term effects of intensive BP lowering on gait and mobility outcomes. This may have limited 
power to detect differences in gait speed or mobility limitation.
In summary, intensive BP lowering was not associated with changes in gait speed or 
transitions in mobility status among adults 75 years and older in SPRINT. The benefits of 
intensive BP lowering on cardiovascular prevention and mortality do not appear to impact 
short-term mobility.

N = Number of times each transition was observed. Rate = Rate of each transition per 100 person-years of follow-up. For Gait Speed and Self-Report model, mobility limitation was defined as having a gait 
speed <0.6 m/s OR reporting a lot of difficulty climbing stairs AND reporting some difficulty walking about or being confined to bed. For Gait Speed Only model, mobility limitation was based solely on 
gait speed (<0.6 m/s), requiring that any changes in gait speed were ≥0.127 m/s in order to define a transition between the two mobility states (See Methods).
