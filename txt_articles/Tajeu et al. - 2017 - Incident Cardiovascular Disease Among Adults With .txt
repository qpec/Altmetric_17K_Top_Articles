BACKGROUND: Data from before the 2000s indicate that the majority of 
incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events occur among US adults with 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) ≥140/90 mm 
Hg. Over the past 
several decades, BP has declined and hypertension control has improved.
METHODS: We estimated the percentage of incident CVD events that occur at 
SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg in a pooled analysis of 3 contemporary US cohorts: 
the REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke), 
the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), and the JHS (Jackson Heart 
Study) (n=31 
856; REGARDS=21 
208; MESA=6779; JHS=3869). Baseline 
study visits were conducted in 2003 to 2007 for REGARDS, 2000 to 2002 for 
MESA, and 2000 to 2004 for JHS. BP was measured by trained staff using 
standardized methods. Antihypertensive medication use was self-reported. The 
primary outcome was incident CVD, defined by the first occurrence of fatal or 
nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, or 
heart failure. Events were adjudicated in each study.
RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 2584 participants had incident 
CVD events. Overall, 63.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.9‒71.1) of 
events occurred in participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg; 58.4% (95% 
CI, 47.7‒69.2) and 68.1% (95% CI, 60.1‒76.0) among those taking and not 
taking antihypertensive medication, respectively. The majority of events occurred 
in participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg among those <65 years of age 
(66.7%; 95% CI, 60.5‒73.0) and ≥65 years of age (60.3%; 95% CI, 51.0‒69.5), 
women (61.4%; 95% CI, 49.9‒72.9) and men (63.8%; 95% CI, 58.4‒69.1), and 
for whites (68.7%; 95% CI, 66.1‒71.3), blacks (59.0%; 95% CI, 49.5‒68.6), 
Hispanics (52.7%; 95% CI, 45.1‒60.4), and Chinese-Americans (58.5%; 95% 
CI, 45.2‒71.8). Among participants taking antihypertensive medication with 
SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg, 76.6% (95% CI, 75.8‒77.5) were eligible for statin 
treatment, but only 33.2% (95% CI, 32.1‒34.3) were taking one, and 19.5% 
(95% CI, 18.5‒20.5) met the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention 
Trial) eligibility criteria and may benefit from a SBP target goal of 120 mm 
Hg.
CONCLUSIONS: Although higher BP levels are associated with increased CVD 
risk, in the modern era, the majority of incident CVD events occur in US adults 
with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg. While absolute risk and cost-effectiveness 
should be considered, additional CVD risk-reduction measures for adults with SBP/
DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg at high risk for CVD may be warranted.

bservational studies have demonstrated graded 
associations between higher systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and increased 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.1 Since 1993, Joint Na-
tional Committee guidelines in the United States have 
categorized adults with SBP ≥140 mm 
Hg or DBP ≥90 
mm 
Hg as having hypertension.2–4 Although most US 
adults have SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg, data from before 
the 2000s indicate that a majority of incident stroke, 
coronary heart disease (CHD), and heart failure (HF) 
events occur among US adults with SBP/DBP ≥140/90 
mm 
Hg (Table 1).5–11 For example, data from the ARIC 
study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities), CHS (Car-
diovascular Health Study), and FHS (Framingham Heart 
Study) indicate that 77% of incident strokes, 69% of 
incident myocardial infarctions (MIs), and 74% of HF 
events occurred among adults with SBP/DBP ≥140/90 
mm 
Hg.11 However, over the past several decades, the 
mean SBP and DBP have declined among US adults.12 
Also, between 1988‒1991 and 2011‒2012, the per-
centage of US adults who have SBP <140 mm 
Hg and 
DBP <90 mm 
Hg has increased from 24% to 52% 
among the overall population with hypertension and 
from 45% to 70% among those with hypertension tak-
ing antihypertensive medication.13,14
Given the shift in BP distribution and hypertension 
control among US adults, the majority of incident CVD 
events may now occur among people with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg. This change would highlight the need 
to focus CVD prevention on further BP reduction and 
treatment of other major CVD risk factors among adults 
with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg. Therefore, the purpose 
of the current study was to determine the percentage of 
incident CVD events occurring among adults with SBP/
DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg. Additionally, to identify opportu-
nities to further reduce CVD risk among adults with SBP/
DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg, we examined the use of statins 
among participants with an indication for a statin. We 
also calculated the percentage of adults with SBP be-
tween 120 mm 
Hg and 139 mm 
Hg who meet eligibility 
criteria for the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Interven-
tion Trial) because this large randomized trial showed a 
SBP target goal of 120 mm 
Hg versus 140 mm 
Hg sub-
stantially lowered risk for CVD and all-cause mortality.15
METHODS
Study Populations
We pooled data from 3 large contemporary US cohorts: 
the REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial 
Differences in Stroke), the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis), and the JHS (Jackson Heart Study). The study 
design, recruitment, and data-collection procedures used in 
these studies have been described in detail previously.16–19 A 
brief description of each cohort is presented in online-only 
Data Supplement Table I.
The current analyses were restricted to participants 
without a history of stroke, CHD, HF, or atherosclerotic 
CVD procedure to examine incident CVD events (Figure 1). 
Complete information on antihypertensive medication use 
and SBP and DBP measurements from the baseline visit for 
each study were required for inclusion in the current anal-
yses. Additionally, 377 participants in the REGARDS study 
and 32 participants in the MESA study without follow-up 
for stroke, CHD, and HF events were excluded. After these 
criteria were applied, data were available for 31 856 partici-
pants (REGARDS, n=21 208; MESA, n=6779; JHS, n=3869). 
REGARDS, JHS, and MESA were each approved by the appro-
priate institutional review boards, and written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants.
Data Collection
For each cohort, we used interview and examination data 
collected at baseline and follow-up data for CVD events. 
Baseline study visits were conducted in 2003 to 2007 for 
REGARDS, 2000 to 2002 for MESA, and 2000 to 2004 for 
JHS. Detailed methods for the baseline data collection in the 
REGARDS study,18 MESA,17 and JHS16,19 have been described 
previously.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Studies conducted before the 2000s reported a 
majority of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
events occurred among adults with systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) ≥140/90 mm 
Hg. 
In 3 US cohorts enrolled after 2000, >60% of inci-
dent CVD events occurred among participants with 
SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg.
• In the 2001 to 2008 National Health and Nutritional 
Examination Survey mortality follow-up study, 58% 
of CVD deaths occurred in US adults with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg.
• Among participants taking antihypertensive medi-
cation with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg, only 33% of 
those who were eligible for statin treatment were 
taking one, and ≈20% met the SPRINT (Systolic 
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) eligibility criteria.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Because the majority of CVD events are now occur-
ring among adults with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg, 
additional BP reduction and treatment of other 
major CVD risk factors should be considered for 
this population, particularly among those with high 
CVD risk.
• Findings from SPRINT indicate that treatment to a 
SBP target of 120 mm 
Hg versus 140 mm 
Hg pre-
vents CVD and reduces the risk for mortality among 
adults with high CVD risk.
• Also, the HOPE-3 trial (Heart Outcomes Prevention 
Evaluation-3) provides evidence that statin therapy 
is well tolerated and lowers the risk of CVD.

BP Measurement
BP was measured in REGARDS, MESA, and JHS by trained 
study staff using standardized methods.17,19,20 In REGARDS, 
SBP and DBP were measured twice, 30 seconds apart, using 
an aneroid sphygmomanometer (American Diagnostic 
Corporation) after the participant had been seated for 5 min-
utes.18,20,21 These measurements were averaged for analysis. 
In MESA, SBP and DBP were measured 3 times at 2-minute 
intervals using a Dinamap model Pro 100 automated oscillo-
metric sphygmomanometer (GE Medical Systems Information 
Technologies, Inc.) after participants rested for 5 minutes in a 
seated position.22 The second and third measurements were 
averaged.17,22 In JHS, at the baseline assessment, SBP and 
DBP were measured twice, separated by 1 minute, with an 
appropriate cuff size using a Hawksley random-zero sphyg-
momanometer (Hawksley and Sons Ltd) after a participant 
had rested for ≥5 minutes. These measurements were aver-
aged for analysis.19 In subsequent JHS visits, an Omron HEM-
907XL (Omron Healthcare Inc.) automatic oscillatory device 
was used to measure BP following the same measurement 
protocol as used for the random-zero sphygmomanometer. 
All BP readings taken in JHS with the random-zero sphygmo-
manometer device were calibrated to the automatic oscilla-
tory device after a BP comparability study.23 Participants were 
categorized as having SBP <140 mm 
Hg and DBP <90 mm 
Hg 
(SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg) or SBP ≥140 mm 
Hg or DBP ≥90 
mm 
Hg (SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm 
Hg) regardless of antihyper-
tensive medication use. As described below, analyses were 
performed for participants overall and by antihypertensive 
medication use.
Study Variables
Age, race/ethnicity, sex, antihypertensive medication use, 
antihyperglycemic medication use (insulin or oral hypoglyce-
mic medication), and current cigarette smoking status were 
self-reported. Obesity was defined as a body mass index 
≥30.0 kg/m2. Using data collected during visits for each 
study, body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared. Total and high-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides were measured from 
fasting blood samples (online-only Data Supplement Table 
I). Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was calculated using 
the Friedewald equation.24 The definitions of diabetes mel-
litus used in each cohort are provided in online-only Data 
Supplement Table I. We calculated 10-year predicted CVD 
risk using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations.25 Indications for 
statins included having diabetes mellitus, low-density lipopro-
tein-cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL, or a 10-year CVD risk ≥7.5%.26 
Statin use was determined by pill bottle review. Estimated glo-
merular filtration rate was calculated using the CKD-EPI equa-
tion (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration).27
CVD Outcomes
The primary outcome for the current study was incident CVD, 
defined by the first occurrence of a fatal or nonfatal stroke, 
nonfatal MI, fatal CHD, or nonfatal HF. Detailed descriptions 
of the adjudication process in REGARDS,18,28,29 MESA,17,30 and 
JHS31 have been published previously. In brief, study partici-
pants or their proxies were contacted to identify hospital-
izations and possible CVD events at 6-month intervals for

REGARDS, 9- to 12-months intervals for MESA, and annu-
ally for JHS. If a hospitalization for CVD was suspected, then 
the event was adjudicated by trained physicians. Deaths were 
detected by report from next of kin, the National Death Index, 
or through online sources (eg, Social Security Death Index). 
Interviews were conducted with proxies or next of kin regard-
ing the circumstances surrounding death, including the pres-
ence of chest pain. Cause of death was adjudicated using 
information obtained from proxies, medical history, death cer-
tificates, and autopsy reports. Incident stroke events included 
the first occurrence of a definite nonfatal or fatal stroke.31–33 
Incident CHD events were defined as the first occurrence of a 
definite or probable nonfatal MI or definite or probable fatal 
CHD event.28,31,32 Incident HF events were defined as a defi-
nite or probable HF hospitalization.17,29,31 More details on the 
definitions for incident stroke, CHD, and HF are presented in 
online-only Data Supplement Table I. Adjudicated events for 
stroke, CHD, and HF for REGARDS were available from the 
baseline examination (2003–2007) through December 31, 
2012, and for MESA from the baseline examination (2000–
2002) through December 31, 2013. For JHS, stroke and CHD 
adjudication were available from the baseline examination 
(2000–2004) through December 31, 2012. However, HF adju-
dication did not begin until January 1, 2005. Therefore, for 
HF, we used JHS follow-up data from 2005 through 2012.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed for participants overall and for 
those taking and not taking antihypertensive medication, 
separately. Participant characteristics were calculated with 
the statistical significance of differences between those with 
SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg versus SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm Hg 
determined using t tests and χ2 tests for continuous and 
categorical variables, respectively. P values <0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant. The percentage of incident 
CVD, stroke, CHD, and HF events occurring among partici-
pants with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg and SBP/DBP ≥140/90 
mm Hg, separately, was calculated overall and in subgroups 
defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Results from indi-
vidual studies were pooled to obtain a weighted estimate 
using a random-effects model meta-analysis for propor-
tions.34 Next, incidence rates for CVD, stroke, CHD, and HF 
were calculated. These rates were calculated for the overall 
population and in subgroups defined by age, sex, race/eth-
nicity, current smoking, and diabetes mellitus status within 
each study, with pooled weighted estimates calculated using 
random-effects models.35 The statistical significance of differ-
ences in percentages and incidence rates across subgroups 
and by antihypertensive medication use status was calcu-
lated using Poisson regression models within each study and 
using random-effects models for the pooled results. Robust

variance estimators were used in Poisson regression models 
when comparing percentages.36
To investigate potential opportunities to lower CVD risk 
among adults taking antihypertensive medication with SBP/
DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg, we calculated the percentage of par-
ticipants with an indication for statins who were taking 
 
a statin and the percentage with SBP ≥120 mm 
Hg and <140 
mm 
Hg who were SPRINT eligible. SPRINT eligibility was defined 
as being ≥50 years of age, having SBP between 130 and 180 
mm 
Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medi-
cations prescribed), having high CVD risk, being free of dia-
betes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, overt proteinuria, and 
not having a history of stroke.15 High CVD risk criteria included 
the presence of an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 to 
59 mL/min/1.73 m2, a 10-year Framingham risk score for CVD 
 
≥15%, or ≥75 years of age.
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, we cal-
culated the percentage of incident CVD, stroke, CHD, and 
HF events that occurred among participants with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg in MESA and JHS, updating BP and antihy-
pertensive medication use status to the nearest examination 
visit before their incident CVD event, rather than utilizing val-
ues from the baseline examination. We also calculated inci-
dence rates updating BP and antihypertensive medication use 
status using data collected during follow-up visits. Second, to 
assess the percentage of CVD events that occurred at SBP/
DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg in a nationally representative sample, we 
utilized NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey) data from 2001 to 2008 with mortality follow-up 
through 2011. Using these data, we determined the percent-
age of CVD deaths occurring among US adults with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg and CVD mortality rates per 1000 person 
years of observation. The analysis of NHANES data accounted 
for its complex survey design and were weighted to the nonin-
stitutionalized US population.37 Cause of death in NHANES was 
determined by linking the data to the National Death Index.37 
Third, we calculated the percentage of incident CVD, stroke, 
CHD, and HF events that occurred among participants with 
SBP/DBP <130/80 mm 
Hg and, separately, SBP/DBP <150/100 
mm 
Hg. Fourth, we determined the percentage of incident CVD 
events among participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg after 
excluding Hispanic and Chinese MESA participants because the 
REGARDS study and JHS enrolled only black and white adults. 
Fifth, the REGARDS study used an aneroid sphygmomanom-
eter to measure BP in the home. Previous studies have reported 
only small differences in BP measured by aneroid and oscillo-
metric methods.38,39 However, BP measured in the home may 
be lower compared with BP measured in the clinic.40 Therefore, 
we determined the proportion of incident events that occurred 
among REGARDS study participants with SBP <135 mm 
Hg 
and DBP <85 mm 
Hg. All analyses were conducted using SAS 
Version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and STATA Version 13 (StataCorp).
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
After pooling participants from REGARDS, MESA, 
and JHS, 78.3% of the sample had SBP/DBP <140/90 
mm Hg (Table 2). Among the overall population and 
for participants taking and not taking antihypertensive 
medication, separately, those with SBP/DBP <140/90 
mm Hg were younger, more likely to be white, less 
likely to be men, current smokers, and have diabetes 
mellitus compared with those with SBP/DBP ≥140/90 
mm Hg. Among participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 
mm Hg, 55.9% had a 10-year CVD risk ≥7.5% com-
pared with 90.6% of participants with SBP/DBP 
≥140/90 mm Hg. A lower percentage of participants 
with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg were taking antihyper-
tensive medication compared with participants with 
SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm Hg. Participant characteristics 
are presented for each cohort (REGARDS, MESA, and 
JHS) separately in online-only Data Supplement Table II.
Percentage of Incident Events Occurring in 
Participants With SBP/DBP ≤140/90 mm 
Hg
Over a mean follow-up time of 7.7 years (maximum 
follow-up 13.5 years), 2584 participants had an inci-
dent CVD event. Overall, 63.0% (95% confidence in-
terval [CI], 54.9‒71.1) of incident CVD events occurred 
in participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg (Figure 2, 
top; online-only Data Supplement Table III). Within every 
age, sex, and race/ethnicity subgroup, the majority of in-
cident CVD events occurred in participants with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg. The percentage of incident CVD events 
that occurred among participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 
mm 
Hg was lower among those taking versus not tak-
ing antihypertensive medication. The majority of incident 
stroke, CHD, and HF events occurred in participants with 
SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg overall and also among partici-
pants taking and not taking antihypertensive medication 
(Figure 2, middle and lower; online-only Data Supplement 
Table III). Overall, 66.0% (95% CI, 63.6‒68.3), 54.6% 
(95% CI, 51.0‒58.2), and 68.6% (95% CI, 63.6‒73.7) 
of incident CVD events in REGARDS, MESA, and JHS, 
respectively, occurred among participants with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg (online-only Data Supplement Table IV).
Incidence Rates for CVD, Stroke, CHD, 
and HF Events
The incidence of CVD among participants with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg and SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm 
Hg was 8.0 
(95% CI, 6.7–9.2) and 18.1 (95% CI, 16.7–19.6) per 
1000 person-years, respectively (Table 3). Among partici-
pants taking antihypertensive medication with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg and SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm 
Hg, the inci-
dence of CVD was 11.9 (95% CI, 11.1–12.7) and 19.9 
(95% CI, 18.3–21.5) per 1000 person-years, respectively. 
Among participants who were not taking antihyperten-
sive medication, the incidence of CVD was 5.7 (95% CI, 
3.9–7.5) per 1000 person-years for those with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg and 15.7 (95% CI, 13.2–18.2) per 1000 
person-years for those with SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm 
Hg.

online-only Data Supplement Table V through VII provide 
incidence rates for CVD, stroke, CHD, and HF events for 
the REGARDS study, MESA and JHS, respectively.
Statin Use and SPRINT Eligibility
Among participants who were taking antihypertensive 
medication with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg, 76.6% (95% 
CI, 75.8‒77.5) had an indication for a statin of whom 
33.2% (95% CI, 32.1‒34.3) were taking a statin (Table 4). 
For participants with SBP ≥120 mm 
Hg and <140 mm 
Hg 
who were taking antihypertensive medication, 19.5% 
(95% CI, 18.5‒20.5) met the SPRINT eligibility criteria.
Sensitivity Analyses
After updating BP and antihypertensive medication use 
status to the nearest examination visit before an incident 
CVD event, 59.9% (95% CI, 56.3‒63.4) and 62.7% 
(57.5‒68.0) of incident CVD events occurred among 
MESA and JHS participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 
mm 
Hg, respectively (online-only Data Supplement Table 
VIII). Incidence rates calculated using updated BP and an-
tihypertensive medication use status for MESA and JHS 
participants are presented in online-only Data Supple-
ment Table IX and X, respectively. Using NHANES 2001 to 
2008 data, 58.0% (95% CI, 52.0‒63.7) of CVD deaths 
occurred among US adults with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg 
(online-only Data Supplement Table XI). CVD mortal-
ity rates are presented in online-only Data Supplement 
Table XII. Overall, 35.5% (95% CI, 33.6‒37.3) of incident 
CVD events occurred among participants with SBP/DBP 
<130/80 mm 
Hg, and 80.0% (95% CI, 78.5‒81.6) of 
incident CVD events occurred among participants with 
SBP/DBP <150/100 mm 
Hg (online-only Data Supplement 
Table XIII and XIV, respectively). When restricting the anal-
ysis to whites and blacks, 64.0% (95% CI, 62.0‒65.9) 
of incident CVD events occurred in participants with 
SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg (online-only Data Supple-
ment Table XV). Finally, 54.0% (95% CI, 51.5‒56.4) of 
incident CVD, 56.1% (95% CI, 52.1‒60.0) of incident 
stroke, 53.4% (95% CI, 49.9‒56.9) of incident CHD, and 
48.1% (95% CI, 43.3‒53.0) of incident HF events in the 
REGARDS study occurred among participants with SBP/
DBP <135/85 mm 
Hg.

BP indicates blood pressure; CVD, cardiovascular disease; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; and LDL, low-density lipoprotein. Numbers in the table are percentages 
or mean with standard deviation in parentheses. BP <140/90 mm 
Hg defined as systolic blood pressure <140 mm 
Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm 
Hg. BP 
≥140/90 mm 
Hg defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm 
Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm 
Hg. Participant characteristics and blood pressure categories 
were calculated from the baseline exams in the following years: Raasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study, 2003–2007; Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis, 2000–2002; Jackson Heart Study, 2000–2004.

DISCUSSION
Several important findings are evident from the current 
pooled analysis of 3 contemporary US cohort studies. 
First, >60% of incident CVD events occurred in par-
ticipants with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg. This finding 
represents a fundamental shift from previous decades 
when the majority of incident CVD events occurred 
among US adults with SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm 
Hg. Sec-
ond, as expected from previous research, the incidence 
rate of CVD was higher among adults with SBP/DBP 
≥140/90 mm 
Hg compared with participants with SBP/
DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg. However, a majority of individu-
als with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg had a 10-year pre-
dicted CVD risk ≥7.5%. Third, only 33.2% of partici-
pants taking antihypertensive medication with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg and an indication for statins were tak-
ing one at the baseline examination of the 3 cohorts.

Finally, 19.5% of participants with SBP between 120 
mm 
Hg and 139 mm 
Hg who were taking antihyper-
tensive medication met the eligibility criteria for SPRINT 
and may benefit from a SBP target goal of 120 mm 
Hg.
The finding that the majority of incident CVD events 
in the modern era occur in participants with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg represents a change from studies 
conducted in prior eras. In US cohort studies from the 
1960s through the 1990s, a majority of incident CVD 
events occurred among adults with SBP/DBP ≥140/90 
mm 
Hg.5–11 The results of the current study, which in-
cluded contemporary population-based and nationally 
representative samples, are consistent with the increas-
ing awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension 
that has occurred in the United States over the past 
several decades.13,14 The US NHANES data indicate that 
from 1988‒1991 to 2011‒2012, awareness of hyper-
tension among adults increased from 69% to 82%

and treatment rates increased from 53% to 75%.13,14 
Also, the percentage of US adults with controlled SBP 
and DBP increased substantially over this time frame.13 
When NHANES data were examined in the current 
study, the majority of CVD mortality occurred among 
individuals with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg. In contrast 
to these findings, the Global Burden of Hypertension 
and Systolic Blood Pressure study reported that most 
CVD deaths worldwide occur at SBP ≥140 mm 
Hg.41 
Data on CVD deaths were not presented separately for 
the United States. In the GBS (Global Burden Study), 
the majority of disability-adjusted life-years lost in the 
United States occurred at a lower level of SBP com-
pared with other countries and regions, indicating that 
the United States is an outlier. The current study sug-
gests that this may extend from disability-adjusted life-
years lost to incident CVD events.
Elevated BP is a well-established risk factor for stroke, 
CHD, and HF.1 Although the majority of CVD events 
occurred among participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 
mm 
Hg in the current study, participants with SBP/
DBP ≥140/90 mm 
Hg had a higher incidence of CVD. 
Among participants not taking antihypertensive medi-
cation, the incidence of CVD was almost 3 times higher 
for those with SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm 
Hg versus SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg. Further improving BP control among 
US adults has the potential to reduce CVD incidence.11
More than 50% of participants with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg had a 10-year predicted CVD risk 
≥7.5%. Among those individuals taking antihyperten-
sive medication, >75% with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg 
had a 10-year CVD risk ≥7.5%, demonstrating that a 
large percentage of adults are at increased risk for CVD 
events. Previous studies have shown that controlling BP 
to <140/90 mm 
Hg using antihypertensive medication 
does not return CVD risk to the level of individuals with 
the same BP without antihypertensive treatment.42,43 
These data highlight the need for primordial preven-
tion of hypertension, earlier detection and treatment of 
hypertension, and additional CVD risk reduction strate-
gies for adults with hypertension once BP control has 
been achieved.
Statins may be underutilized among adults taking 
antihypertensive medication with SBP/DBP <140/90 
mm 
Hg. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment 
of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardio-
vascular Risk in Adults recommends statin use for the 
primary prevention of CVD among adults with diabetes 
mellitus, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ≥190 mg/
dL, or a 10-year predicted CVD risk ≥7.5%.26 Although 
>75% of participants who were taking antihyperten-
sive medication with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg had an 
indication for a statin, only 33% of these participants 
were taking one. The baseline exams for the current 
study occurred before the 2013 American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline was 
published. Results from the HOPE-3 trial (Heart Out-
comes Prevention Evaluation 3) suggest that long-term 
statin use is effective for CVD risk reduction.44 Specifi-
cally, over a median follow-up of 5.6 years in HOPE-
3, randomization to 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin daily 
versus placebo was associated with a 24% CVD risk 
reduction. Statin medication has also been found to be 
cost-effective.45
SPRINT provides evidence for another risk-reduction 
strategy among adults with hypertension and SBP/
DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg.15 SPRINT demonstrated a 25% 
reduction in CVD events, a 38% reduction in HF, and 
a 27% reduction in mortality among participants ran-
domized to a SBP target goal of 120 mm Hg compared 
with their counterparts randomized to the conven-
tional SBP goal of 140 mm 
Hg.15 In addition, intensive 
BP management as tested in SPRINT was determined 
to be cost-effective at a ratio of $23 
777 per quality-
adjusted life-year gained.46 In the current study, 19.5% 
of participants with SBP between 120 and 139 mm 
Hg 
who were taking antihypertensive medication met the 
SPRINT eligibility criteria. Although absolute risk and 
cost-effectiveness should be considered when making 
treatment decisions, these individuals may benefit from 
a lower SBP target goal.
The current study has a number of strengths. We used 
data from 3 contemporary population-based cohort 
studies, and the consistency of results across studies and 
demographic characteristics suggests that these findings 
may have a high degree of generalizability. Also, BP was 
measured using a standardized protocol in each study, 
and CVD events were adjudicated by trained physicians. 
The current study should be interpreted in the context 
of known and potential limitations. Although protocols 
for measuring variables across studies were similar, there 
were differences including the devices used to measure 
BP
. The REGARDS study used an aneroid sphygmoma-
nometer to measure BP in the home. Although previ-
ous studies have reported only small differences in BP 
measured by aneroid and oscillometric methods,38,39 
this approach may have resulted in lower BP readings 
compared with MESA and JHS. However, the majority of 
CVD events occurred among participants with SBP/DBP 
<140/90 mm 
Hg in each study. Also, although we were 
able to update BP levels and antihypertensive medication 
use for MESA and JHS participants in sensitivity analyses, 
the REGARDS study second in-home visit was conducted 
from May 2013 to November 2016, and outcomes in 
the REGARDS study have only been adjudicated through 
December 31, 2012. Therefore, we were unable to ana-
lyze data from the follow-up visit for the REGARDS study. 
Additionally, BP was only measured at a single visit. BP 
varies from day to day, and some participants may have 
been misclassified as having SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg. 
However, previous studies report that BP is lower when

based on the average of measurements obtained across 
multiple clinic visits compared with a single visit.47,48 
Therefore, the percentage of CVD events occurring at 
SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg is likely higher than we esti-
mated in the current study. We did not have information 
on the cumulative burden of BP in participants before the 
baseline examination. Prior studies provide evidence that 
the cumulative burden of BP assessed across the lifespan, 
rather than measurements from individual visits, may be 
more strongly associated with subclinical markers of CVD 
and future CVD events.43,49 Finally, although the cohorts 
included in the current analysis were population-based, 
they do not provide nationally representative data. How-
ever, we analyzed data from the NHANES and showed 
that the majority of CVD deaths occurred among US 
adults with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg.
CONCLUSIONS
In this pooled analysis of adults without a history of 
CVD enrolled in 3 large population-based US cohorts 
conducted in the 2000s, >60% of incident CVD events 
occurred among participants with BP <140/90 mm 
Hg. 
These findings represent a fundamental change from 
previous studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, 
wherein the majority of CVD events occurred among 
participants with BP ≥140/90 mm 
Hg. The incidence 
of CVD was higher for adults with SBP/DBP ≥140/90 
mm 
Hg, reinforcing the importance of improving BP 
control among this population. Efforts directed at low-
ering BP and reducing CVD risk among adults with SBP/
DBP <140/90 mm 
Hg are needed, particularly among 
those with a 10-year CVD risk ≥7.5%.
