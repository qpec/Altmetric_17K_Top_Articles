The development of malaria parasites throughout their various life cycle stages is coordinated
by changes in gene expression. We previously showed that the three-dimensional organi-
zation of the Plasmodium falciparum genome is strongly associated with gene expression
during its replication cycle inside red blood cells. Here, we analyze genome organization in
the P. falciparum and P. vivax transmission stages. Major changes occur in the localization and
interactions of genes involved in pathogenesis and immune evasion, host cell invasion, sexual
differentiation, and master regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, we observe reorga-
nization of subtelomeric heterochromatin around genes involved in host cell remodeling.
Depletion of heterochromatin protein 1 (PfHP1) resulted in loss of interactions between
virulence genes, confirming that PfHP1 is essential for maintenance of the repressive center.
Our results suggest that the three-dimensional genome structure of human malaria parasites
is strongly connected with transcriptional activity of specific gene families throughout the life
cycle.

ith an estimated 438,000 deaths per year, malaria is
still one of the most deadly infectious diseases, mostly
targeting young children in sub-Saharan Africa1. The
disease is caused by one of five parasites of the Plasmodium
genus, of which P. falciparum is the most common and deadliest.
P. vivax is also responsible for significant disease, mostly in
Southeast Asia1.
Plasmodium parasites have complex life cycles that involve a
human host and a mosquito vector. Infection in humans starts
when an infected female Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal
and transmits parasites that are present in the form of sporozoites
in her salivary glands. These sporozoites are inoculated into
the skin, travel to the liver and establish an infection in hepato-
cytes. Over a period of several days, the parasite replicates
and eventually releases thousands of merozoites into the blood-
stream. Alternatively, P. vivax can survive in the liver for weeks or
years in dormant forms called hypnozoites, which can be reac-
tivated and cause malaria relapses. Merozoites that emerge from
the liver start a 48-h replication cycle in red blood cells. During
this asexual intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC), the
parasite progresses through three main developmental stages:
ring, trophozoite, and schizont, to produce 8–24 daughter para-
sites, which burst from the cell and invade new erythrocytes.
During the IDC, the parasite can commit to differentiation into
male and female gametocytes, which can be taken up by another
mosquito. Inside the mosquito, the parasite undergoes sexual
reproduction and further develops through several stages into
the salivary gland sporozoites that can be transmitted to a new
human host.
Understanding how the transitions between the various life
cycle stages of the Plasmodium parasite are regulated remains an
important goal in malaria research. Stage transitions are regulated
by coordinated changes in gene expression, but it is still largely
unknown how these changes in transcriptional profiles are con-
trolled at the transcriptional level. Only a single family of ApiAP2
transcription factors (TFs) with 27 members has been identified,
while approximately two-thirds of the TFs expected based on the
size of the Plasmodium genome seem to be missing2. Several of
these ApiAP2 TFs are involved in stage transitions, such as
PfAP2-G, which is thought to be the main driver for gametocyte
differentiation3–5. Our understanding of how these TFs are
controlled and how various TFs may act together to form tran-
scriptional networks is still very limited.
In recent years, considerable insight has been gained into the
role of epigenetics, chromatin structure, and genome organization
in gene regulation, mostly during the IDC of P. falciparum.
Studies show that the parasite genome is largely in an active,
euchromatic state6–8, while members of several parasite-specific
gene families involved in virulence (var, rifin, stevor, and pfmc-
2tm), erythrocyte remodeling (phist, hyp, fikk, and others) and
solute transport (clag3) are organized into heterochromatin7,9–11.
In particular, the family of var genes has received much attention,
since these genes are key to pathogenesis and immune escape.
Out of a total of 60 var genes, only a single variant is expressed
within an individual parasite, while the other 59 genes are tightly
repressed by a combination of isolation into a perinuclear com-
partment, repressive histone marks, and repressive long non-
coding RNAs7,12–15.
Previously, we assessed genome organization at the ring, tro-
phozoite, and schizont stages of the IDC in P. falciparum using
Hi-C experiments (chromosome conformation capture coupled
with next-generation sequencing)16 and compared our findings to
an earlier Hi-C study in ring-stage P. falciparum17. We observed a
strong
association
between
genome architecture
and
gene
expression, suggesting that the three-dimensional organization of
the genome is very important for gene regulation. Here, we
analyze the genome organization in the transmission stages of the
P. falciparum life cycle (gametocytes and sporozoites), as well as
for P. vivax sporozoites, and present a comparative analysis of
genome organization throughout the different life cycle stages.
Finally, to meaningfully compare changes in genome organization
throughout the Plasmodium life cycle, we developed a novel
statistical test to detect loci that differ significantly in their
intrachromosomal contact count numbers between stages. While
large-scale features of chromosome organization are preserved in
the sexually differentiated stages, we observe several stage-specific
specific changes, including reorganization of genes encoding
rDNA, invasion proteins, and transcription factors. During
gametocytogenesis, heterochromatic regions at the ends of
chromosomes expand to include genes involved in host cell
remodeling and a broad superdomain is created on chromosome
14. A prominent feature of genome organization in the sporozoite
stage is the establishment of long-range DNA interactions for
genes involved in sporozoite migration and hepatocyte invasion.
Our results provide important novel insights into the connection
between genome organization, heterochromatin, and stage-
specific gene expression.
Results
Capturing genome conformation of Plasmodium transmission
stages. To complement our previous study describing the genome
architecture of P. falciparum during the intraerythrocytic devel-
opmental cycle (IDC)16, we performed Hi-C experiments on
three additional stages of the P. falciparum life cycle: early
gametocytes (stage II/III), late gametocytes (stage IV/V), and
salivary gland sporozoites (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1, and
Supplementary Fig. 1) using the tethered conformation capture
methodology. In addition, to evaluate similarities and differences
in genome organization between the highly pathogenic P. falci-
parum and the less virulent P. vivax, we generated Hi-C data for
P. vivax salivary gland sporozoites. For each stage, we obtained
high-quality data, evidenced by a log-linear relationship between
contact
probability
and
genomic
distance
(Supplementary
Fig. 2A), as well as interchromosomal contact probability (ICP)
and percentage of long-range contacts (PLRC) values in agree-
ment with previous studies (Supplementary Table 2). Biological
replicates of both P. falciparum and P. vivax sporozoite stage
parasites showed a high degree of similarity (Supplementary
Fig. 2B, C), demonstrating the robustness of our methodology.
The data from these replicates were combined to obtain higher
resolution for subsequent analyses.
Next, the observed intrachromosomal and interchromosomal
contacts were aggregated into contact count matrices at 10-kb
resolution and were normalized using the ICE method to correct
for experimental and technical biases18 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary
Data 1, and Supplementary Data 2). In addition, we identified
significant
contacts
using
fit-hi-c,
which
controls
for
the
propensity of adjacent loci to have more contacts and calculates
a p-value reflecting the probability that the number of contacts
in that bin is larger than expected by chance19. We inferred a
consensus 3D genome structure for each of the transmission
stages and the three IDC stages using Pastis20 (Fig. 1c). The
stability of these consensus structures was assessed by generating
5000 possible structures from varying initial starting points.
A principal component analysis showed strong clustering of
structures from the same stage, and clear separation between
structures of different stages, except for early and late gametocytes
(Supplementary Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the genome
organization of early and late gametocytes is similar, while there
are distinct differences between all other stages that are captured
using a single representative structure for each stage.

 Universal and stage-specific features of genome organization.
From the contact count matrices and the consensus 3D struc-
tures, it became apparent that large-scale features of genome
organization at the gametocyte stage were comparable to those
of the IDC stages, including colocalization of centromeres
and clustering of telomeres and virulence genes (all p-values <

 increased interactions among virulence genes and exported pro-
teins, repression of invasion genes, change in organization of
ribosomal DNA genes, as well as the formation of large domains
on chromosome 14 in close proximity to a female gametocyte-
specific pfap2 transcription factor locus. These changes will be
addressed in more detail in the next sections. At the sporozoite
stage of P. falciparum, the clustering of telomeres was conserved,
but the colocalization of the centromeres was completely lost
(p-value = 0.49,
Witten–Noble
colocalization
test),
Fig.
1c,
rightmost panel, and Supplementary Fig. 3A). In contrast, in
P. vivax sporozoites, the centromeres colocalized significantly
(p-value < 0.0001, Witten-–Noble colocalization test), but these
interactions were only observed at the centromere itself and did
not involve any of the surrounding regions (Supplementary
Fig. 3B). While our result will need to be validated by an inde-
pendent approach, our Hi-C experiment is so far the only suc-
cessful technique that has been able to monitor a reduction in
centromere clustering in the sporozoite stage. To better visualize
the large-scale differences between the various stages of the
P. falciparum life cycle, we generated an animation of the changes
in genome organization during the stage transitions, which
highlights that chromosomes undergo dramatic rearrangement in
sporozoites as compared to the blood stages (Supplementary
Movie 1).
The groups of genes described in the previous sections were
examined independently and were selected based on our prior
knowledge of the function of these genes, rather than as the result
of a systematic screen for changes in contact counts. To
systematically identify changes in genome conformation between
the various stages, we designed a statistical test that analyzes
differences in the number of intrachromosomal contacts for each
10-kb bin in the normalized contact count matrices between
pairs of stages. Loci that show a two-fold or larger difference in
contacts, after normalizing for the effect of genomic distance,
with a false discovery rate of less than 1% are listed in
Supplementary Data 3. As expected, interactions at the sporozoite
stages were most different from those in other stages of the life
cycle.
Several
chromosomes
showed
large
rearrangements
towards the chromosome ends, for example the right arm of
chromosome 4 (Supplementary Fig. 4), involving gene families
coding for exported proteins involved in virulence and erythro-
cyte remodeling. The fold-change heatmaps (accessible at http://
noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/plasmo3d_sexualstages/), the con-
tact count heatmaps, and the confidence score heatmaps showed
many additional differences in chromosome conformation during
stage transitions, as detailed below. The interaction patterns were
similar in two distinct field isolates for sporozoites and in two
laboratory strains for gametocytes, suggesting that genetic
variations did not influence our results. Furthermore, the Hi-C
methodology has recently been used to detect translocations
in genomes and to correct genome assemblies based on Illumina
and/or
PacBio
sequencing
in
many
organisms,
including
Plasmodium
knowlesi,
Arabidopsis
thaliana,
and
Aedes
aegypti22–25. It is therefore unlikely that the changes that we
observed between life cycle stages are artifacts caused by genomic
recombination during in vitro parasite culture, since none of the
interchromosomal heatmaps (Supplementary Fig. 3A) showed
any evidence of such recombination events. To further validate
our results, we have introduced interchromosomal and intra-
chromosomal translocations in the P. vivax genome to visualize
the aberrant patterns that such recombination events would
produce (Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, we scanned our
samples using a recently published metric developed to detect
genome assembly errors in Hi-C data24 and did not detect any
signs of misassembly or translocations (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Additional simulations showed that translocations of a single
10-kb bin are not easily detectable, but larger regions are
detectable when there is a separation of a few bins between them
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
pfap2-g leaves the repressive center during gametocytogenesis.
Previous work has shown that knockdown of heterochromatin
protein 1 (PfHP1) during the IDC results in activation of the
gametocyte-specific transcription factor locus pfap2-g and an
increased formation of gametocytes26. PfHP1 interacts with the
repressive histone mark H3K9me3 on silenced var genes that are
colocalized in a perinuclear heterochromatic compartment. Using
DNA-FISH, we observed that the pfap2-g locus was located in
close proximity to a subtelomeric var gene on chr8 in >90% of the
cells observed (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 8A), suggesting
that pfap2-g is associated with the repressive cluster during the
IDC. In agreement with this observation, the trophozoite and
schizont stage fit-hi-c p-value heatmaps showed a significant
interaction between pfap2-g and the nearest internal virulence
gene cluster (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 9A). The virulence
cluster and pfap2-g locus each straddle two ten kilobase bins, and
in trophozoites, each of the four possible pairwise interactions
were significant (fit-hi-c q-value < 0.05). We performed virtual 4C
at MboI restriction site resolution to demonstrate that this
interaction was specific for pfap2-g and did not involve the nearby
pfap2 PF3D7_1222400 (Supplementary Fig. 10), although these
two ap2 TF genes are located in neighboring 10 kb bins and
therefore fall outside our limits to detect potential translocations.
In addition, pfap2-g significantly interacted with virulence clus-
ters on chromosomes 6 and 8 in trophozoites (fit-hi-c q-value <
0.05; Supplementary Data 4). In stage II/III gametocytes, no
significant interactions between pfap2-g and virulence clusters
were observed (q-values = 1.0; Fig. 2b; Supplementary Data 4;
Supplementary Table 3), indicating that pfap2-g dissociates from
the repressive cluster in the transition from the IDC to early
gametocytes. Interactions between pfap2-g and virulence clusters
were partially regained in the late gametocyte stage (Supple-
mentary Data 4, Supplementary Table 3). Unfortunately, DNA-
FISH experiments were unsuccessful for the gametocyte stage. An
improved DNA-FISH methodology for the gametocyte stages will
need to be developed to further confirm these results by an
independent approach.
Significant contacts with virulence gene clusters at any
parasite stage were observed for a total of 9 pfap2 loci
(Supplementary Table 3). The dissociation of pfap2 genes from
the repressive center in other stages than the IDC seemed to be a

 general trend: fewer significant contacts (q-value < 0.05) between
pfap2 genes and virulence gene clusters were observed in
gametocytes and sporozoites as compared to the IDC stages (p-
value = 0.0027, one sided sign test; Fig. 2c and Supplementary
Fig. 9B). We used a resampling procedure (see Supplementary
Information) to compare this result to randomly-selected bins;
the p-value was 0.021. Note that pfap2 PF3D7_0420300 is located
in close genomic proximity to a virulence cluster in chromosome
4. To ensure that the significant decrease in pfap2 gene loci
interacting with virulence clusters is not due to this gene, we
repeated the p-value calculation without PF3D7_0420300 and
confirmed that this remained significant (p-value = 1.192e−07,
one-sided sign test). Such changes in interactions with virulence
gene clusters between stages were not observed for an unrelated
gene family (histone genes, data not shown). These results are
indicative of an important connection between genome organiza-
tion and the activity of pfap2 genes that drive parasite life cycle
progression.

 harbor invasion genes (Fig. 2d). These genes encode proteins that
are expressed in merozoites and mediate attachment to and entry
of red blood cells and include several merozoite surface proteins,
S-antigen, and glutamate-rich protein. In contrast to several other
invasion genes (pfrh427, clag, and eba28, these genes are not
known to undergo clonally variant expression, and we therefore
consider their association with heterochromatin in gametocytes
to be a different regulatory mechanism than the epigenetic
mechanisms that control expression of pfrh4, clag, and eba during
the IDC. In gametocytes, these loci showed strong interaction
with the subtelomeric regions, while these contacts were not
observed in the IDC. To quantify this observation, we assessed
the number of significant contacts between invasion gene loci
and virulence clusters in each life cycle stage. A larger number
of significant contacts were observed between invasion genes
and virulence clusters in the transmission stages than in IDC
stages (p-value < 2.2e−16, sign test; Fig. 2e and Supplementary
Fig. 9C). The lack of interactions between invasion gene
GLURP on chromosome 10 (PF3D7_1035300) and var gene
PF3D7_0800300 during the IDC was confirmed by DNA-FISH
(Supplementary Fig. 8B). As mentioned earlier, DNA-FISH
experiments were unfortunately not successful for the gameto-
cyte stage. Collectively, our data indicate that, similar to the pfap2
gene family, the expression of invasion genes during the life cycle
is correlated with association with or dissociation from repressive
heterochromatin.
Expansion of subtelomeric heterochromatin in gametocytes.
To further study changes in chromatin organization during
gametocytogenesis, we determined the distribution of repressive
histone mark H3K9me3 in late ring/early trophozoites and stage
IV/V gametocytes by performing ChIP-seq on two biological
replicates for each stage (Supplementary Fig. 11A and Supple-
mentary Data 5) that were combined for downstream analyses.
We used two different commercially available anti-H3K9me3
antibodies to rule out that our ChIP-seq results were influenced
by the antibody used. In trophozoites, H3K9me3 marking was
restricted to subtelomeric regions, internal virulence gene clusters
and a few additional loci (including pfap2-g and dblmsp2), as
previously described for both H3K9me37,8 and PfHP129 (Fig. 3a
and Supplementary Fig. 11B, C). These same regions were
occupied by H3K9me3 in gametocytes. In addition, in several
chromosomes,
the
subtelomeric
heterochromatin
marking
expanded to more internally located genes in gametocytes
(Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 11B, C). The expansion of
heterochromatin at the chromosome ends was also visible in the
contact count heatmaps as larger subtelomeric domains that
showed strong intra-domain interactions and were depleted of
interactions with the internal region of the chromosome (Sup-
plementary Data 1). While not all genes in these regions were
marked by H3K9me3, a total of 79 genes showed increased
H3K9me3 levels in gametocytes as compared to trophozoites, 61
of which were exported proteins that may play a role in ery-
throcyte remodeling (Supplementary Data 5). These genes
included members of the phist (n = 15 out of a total of 68), hyp
(n = 7 out of 34) and fikk (n = 7 out of 19) families, as well as 32
other genes annotated as exported proteins or containing a
PEXEL export motif (Fig. 3d, e). Other members of gene families
encoding exported proteins were marked with H3K9me3 in the
IDC. However, 47 of these 61 genes have never been detected in a
heterochromatic state in the IDC7,8,29. At two loci on chr9 and
chr14, respectively, H3K9me3 was lost in gametocytes (Fig. 3f).
The locus on chr9 is between two genes known to be involved
in gametocyte differentiation (pfgdv1 and pfgig) and is deleted
in various gametocyte-defective P. falciparum strains30. On
chromosome 14, the genes that were not marked by H3K9me3 in
gametocytes encode exported proteins that have been implicated
in gametocytogenesis: PF3D7_1476600, PF3D7_1477300 (Pfg14-
744),
PF3D7_1477400,
and
PF3D7_1477700
(Pfg14-748)30.
These results imply that H3K9me3 and chromatin structure
play important roles in gene activation and silencing during
gametocyte formation. To validate the 3D modeling and hetero-
chromatin clustering, we performed immunofluorescence ima-
ging against repressive histone mark H3K9me3. We identified a
single nuclear H3K9me3 focus per nuclei in rings and schizonts
(Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 12), corresponding to the single
repressive center harboring all virulence genes as predicted by our
3D models. In trophozoites, the number of foci varied, in line
with nuclear expansion16,31, and the progression of DNA repli-
cation that takes place at the end of this stage (Fig. 3g). Game-
tocytes showed either one or two H3K9me3 foci that did not seem
to be associated with a male or female phenotype.
Formation of superdomains on a P. falciparum chromosome.
Chromosome 14 showed the formation of a strong domain
boundary in both early and late gametocytes, which was not
observed in any of the other life cycle stages (Fig. 4a and Sup-
plementary Data 1). This separation of the chromosome into two
superdomains is reminiscent of the bipartite structure of the
inactivated X chromosome (Xi) in human, rhesus macaque, and
mouse32–34. Zooming in on the boundary region of P. falciparum
chromosome 14 showed a sharp transition at the MboI restriction
site at nucleotide position 1,187,169 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary
Fig. 13). To demonstrate that this sharp boundary is not the result
of a chromosomal translocation in the NF54 strain used for
gametocyte isolations, we confirmed that the genomic region that
spans the boundary region can be amplified by PCR and can be
detected by Southern blot in both 3D7 and NF54 strains (Sup-
plementary Fig. 14). In eukaryotic genomes, genes close to the
domain boundary are often associated with higher levels of tran-
scription35,36. The domain boundary is located inside or near
PF3D7_1430100, which encodes serine/threonine protein phos-
phatase 2A activator (PTPA; Supplementary Fig. 15A). In humans,
serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one of the four
major Ser/Thr phosphatases and is thought to play a complex, but
mostly inhibitory role in the control of cell growth and division37.
Gametocytes have a higher expression level of pfptpa than the IDC
stages and express a different variant of pfptpa that does not
contain exon 1 (Supplementary Fig. 16A). The sequence of intron
1 is unusual and contains many motifs that are repetitive (for
example, 12 repeats of motif TGTACATACACTTAT and minor
variations thereof, within the 705 nt intron; Supplementary
Fig. 16B). These could be the binding sites for a lncRNA or protein
involved in formation of the domain boundary.
The domain boundary is also relatively close to the pfap2-
encoding
locus
PF3D7_1429200
(chr14:1,144,518–1,148,078)
(Supplementary Fig. 15A). To evaluate whether this TF could
be involved in sexual differentiation, we generated a transgenic
P. berghei strain in which the homolog of PF3D7_1429200
(PBANKA_1015500) was expressed as a GFP-tagged protein
(Supplementary Fig. 15B, C). P. berghei is widely used as a model
for P. falciparum, in part because of the higher efficiency of
genetic manipulations as compared to P. falciparum. Female
gametocytes, activated female gametes, and zygotes all expressed
the tagged ApiAP2 TF with nuclear localization of the protein,
while the protein was completely absent in male gametocytes and
gametes (Fig. 4c), as well as in IDC stages (data not shown).
These results demonstrate that this ApiAP2 TF (named PfAP2-
O3 hereafter in line with a recent publication38) is expressed in a
strict sex-specific fashion.

 Rearrangement of chromosomes in sporozoites. Similar to the
re-localization of invasion genes during the transition from the
IDC to the gametocyte stage, the invasion genes also interacted
more strongly with virulence genes in P. falciparum sporozoites
than during the IDC (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 9C). In P.
vivax sporozoites, a cluster of invasion genes on chromosome
10 showed depletion of interactions with other loci on the same
chromosome as compared to surrounding genomic regions
(Supplementary Fig. 17B). This observation may suggest that the
invasion genes also have a distinct genome organization at this
stage of the P. vivax life cycle. However, these results may also be
caused by sequence variation in invasion genes in the field isolates
used in this study as compared to the reference genome, resulting
in lower mapping to this region.
In addition, distinct changes were noticeable around rDNA
loci. P. falciparum encodes four rDNA units containing single
copies of the 28S, 5.8S, and 18S genes (Fig. 5a). The units on
chromosomes 5 and 7 are active during the human blood stages,
whereas the units on chromosomes 1 and 13 are active in the
mosquito stages. In general, sporozoites showed a large increase
in the number of contacts between rDNA genes and virulence
genes as compared to the IDC stages and gametocytes (Fig. 5b
and Supplementary Fig. 9D). These changes in conformation
were most visible in chromosome 7, in which the rDNA unit is
located at the boundary of two large domains in the IDC stages
and gametocytes, which presumably contributes to its activation
status. In sporozoites on the other hand, the separation of the
chromosome into two large domains disappeared (Fig. 5c and
Supplementary Fig. 4B). Similar changes in domain conformation
can be observed around the rDNA locus on chromosome 5
(Supplementary Fig. 9E).
Prominent features of genome organization in P. falciparum
and P. vivax sporozoites were strong long-range and interchro-
mosomal contacts that involved other genes than virulence genes
and that did not seem to be present in the IDC or gametocyte
stages. In P. vivax, strong intrachromosomal contacts were
present in chromosomes 7 and 11, which also formed strong
interchromosomal interactions with each other and with addi-
tional loci on chromosomes 9 and 13 (Fig. 1b, rightmost panel,
Fig. 5d, and Supplementary Table 4). For P. falciparum,
intrachromosomal interactions were observed in chromosomes
3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 14 (Supplementary Data 1), although,

 interestingly, these are not homologous to the loci that participate
in loops in P. vivax. Several of these loops involved pfap2 loci
and genes involved in sporozoite migration to the liver and in
some cases in hepatocyte invasion, such as circumsporozoite
protein (PfCSP), sporozoite micronemal protein essential for
cell traversal (PfPLP1), thrombospondin-related anonymous
protein (PfTRAP), sporozoite protein essential for cell traversal
(PfSPECT1), and gamete egress and sporozoite traversal protein
(PfGEST) (Table 1).
A putative clonally variant gene family in P. vivax. The genome
annotation of P. vivax is less complete than that of P. falciparum,
and many genes have been grouped into families based solely on
sequence homology. An example is the Pv-fam-e (also named
rad) gene family that is closely related to the Plasmodium
helical interspersed sub-telomeric (phist) gene family39, encoding
exported proteins involved in erythrocyte remodeling40–42. The
P. vivax genome contains 45 rad genes, of which 10 and 27,
respectively, are located in two separate clusters on chromosome
5. In the contact count matrix of P. vivax chromosome 5, the
largest of the two clusters strongly interacted with the (sub-)
telomeric regions and showed a depletion of interactions with all
other intrachromosomal loci (Supplementary Fig. 17C). These
results suggest that P. vivax rad genes may be regulated by
organization into facultative heterochromatin.
PfHP1 is essential for virulence gene colocalization. The clus-
tering of virulence genes seems to be a general feature of the
P. falciparum genome that is maintained throughout its life cycle.
Recently, it was shown that depletion of PfHP1 results in loss of
var gene repression and an arrest in parasite growth26, suggesting
that this protein is essential for structural integrity of the
repressive cluster. To study the effect of PfHP1 depletion on
genome conformation, we performed Hi-C experiments on a
transgenic P. falciparum strain expressing PfHP1 fused to GFP
and a destabilization domain (DD), both in the presence and in
the absence of Shield-1, resulting in expression or knockdown of
the PfHP1 fusion protein, respectively26. Ring-stage parasites
expressing the tagged PfHP1 protein showed a decrease in viru-
lence gene clustering as compared to wild-type parasites (p-value
= 0.026 and p-value ≤ 0.001, respectively, BH FDR-corrected
Paulsen colocalization test43 (see Supplementary Information)).
In particular, interactions between internal and subtelomeric var
gene clusters were lost (Supplementary Fig. 18). This result is in

 agreement with an increase in internal var gene expression in this
strain, as reported previously26. Virulence gene clustering was
completely lost in the PfHP1-depleted strain (p-value = 0.129, BH
FDR-corrected Paulsen colocalization test), in line with a gen-
eralized loss of var gene repression26. Accordingly, we observed
more significantly changing virulence gene bins as compared
with wild-type in the PfHP1-depleted strain (n = 71) than in the
PfHP1-tagged strain (n = 18). These results confirm that PfHP1
is indeed essential for maintenance of the structure of the
repressive cluster and thus for regulation of virulence gene
expression.
The 3D genome structure correlates with gene expression.
Finally, we explored the relationship between gene expression and
3D structure, leveraging four published expression data sets44–47
and our 3D models of the genome architecture. As in our pre-
vious study, we applied kernel canonical correlation analysis
(KCCA)48. KCCA is an unsupervised learning approach akin to
principal component analysis that identifies a set of orthogonal
gene expression components that are coherent with the 3D
structure. To perform this analysis, we separated the 3D models
into three distinct groups: those related to IDC (ring, trophozoite,
schizont), gametocyte (early and late) and sporozoite stages. For
each of these groups of time points, we extracted a gene
expression component and a structure component that exhibited
coherence to the expression profiles and 3D structure, such that
genes whose expression is correlated with the selected gene
expression component tend to be colocalized in 3D. The gene
expression components for the three sets of structures were highly
correlated and were dominated by the repressive center (Fig. 6a
and ref. 16). To further interpret the results of the KCCA, we
extracted ranked lists of genes based on their KCCA scores: lists
that rank genes based on the similarity of their gene expression
profiles with the first or second gene expression components, and
lists that rank genes based on the similarity of their 3D position
with the first or second structure components. We then investi-
gated whether several sets of genes were enriched in those ranked
lists. Var, rifin, and exported protein genes all showed strong and
significant enrichment on the first gene expression and structure
components for all stages (Fig. 6b), as expected based on their
localization in or near the repressive center. In contrast, the
invasion genes were significantly enriched for the first gene
expression component in gametocytes and sporozoites, and for
the second gene expression and structure components in all
stages (Fig. 6b). While the average scores for this group of genes
are relatively small, these results suggest that expression of these
genes is also coordinated with their location within the nucleus.
Gametocyte-specific genes did not show correlation to the first or
second component for either gene expression or structure, which
is in line with regulation of these genes by other factors, such as
the gametocyte-specific transcription factor PfAP2-G, instead of
localization within the nucleus.
Discussion
Understanding the mechanisms involved in gene regulation
during the various life cycle stages of P. falciparum will be
important for the development of novel strategies to block
parasite
replication
and
transmission.
Our
previous
study
described the hallmarks of genome organization during the intra-
erythrocytic developmental stages of P. falciparum, and showed
that nuclear architecture correlated well with gene expression16.

 structure in the stages of parasite transmission from human
to mosquito (gametocytes) and from mosquito to human (spor-
ozoites) and compared all stages to identify various subsets of
genes that exhibit changes in genome organization during the
complex life cycle of Plasmodium parasites.
Our results confirm that virulence gene families, such as var,
rifin, and stevor, cluster in perinuclear heterochromatin, not only
during the IDC stages, but also in gametocytes and sporozoites.
Previous reports showed multiple virulence gene clusters scat-
tered around the nucleus, either by DNA-FISH on telomere
repeat sequences12,13, IFA on H3K9me37 or IFA on proteins that
bind to chromosome ends (PfSIP2-N49) or subtelomeric regions
(PfHP126,49). Our population-based Hi-C data showed strong
interactions between all telomeres, which could be consistent with
a completely random distribution of telomeres over multiple
clusters. However, our IFA results conflict with this large body of
data and instead show a single H3K9me3 focus in all blood stages
in which the parasite is not undergoing DNA replication, repre-
sentative of a single repressive center. Similar results were pre-
viously obtained by IFA against the heterochromatin mark
H3K36me311 and also recently for heterochromatin mark
H3K9me350. Differences in timing during the cell cycle (before or
after start of DNA replication) may account for some of these
differences. Indeed, we also observed multiple H3K9me3 foci
during the trophozoite stage, most likely as a result of nuclear
expansion and the start of DNA multiplication. We currently do
not have an explanation that would reconcile our observations
with those of others in the field. However, whether var genes
cluster in one or multiple repressive centers throughout the IDC,
both models are consistent with the presence of distinct hetero-
chromatin and euchromatin regions controlling gene expression
and antigenic variation in P. falciparum.
In gametocytes, the overall genome organization is similar to
IDC stages, in line with relatively small changes in the gene
expression program during gametocytogenesis51. We observed
specific changes for pfap2-g3 that dissociates from the repressive
center, and for invasion genes that associate with the repressive
center. In addition, subtelomeric genes encoding exported pro-
teins are selectively silenced or activated by H3K9me3 deposition
or removal, respectively. These results confirm that remodeling of
the infected host cell is among the essential changes that occur
during gametocytogenesis52,53, and that an epigenetic switch
provides an extra layer of transcriptional regulation for the genes
involved. The presence of H3K9me3 in the relatively large
intergenic region downstream of pfgdv1 suggests that this region
by itself is an important determinant in the regulation of game-
tocyte differentiation. A lncRNA is transcribed from this region at
low levels during the IDC54, and it is tempting to speculate that

 this transcript is upregulated in gametocytes and possibly essen-
tial for gametocyte development.
The sharp division of chromosome 14 into two superdomains
is an intriguing finding that will need to be explored in more
detail. The inactivated X chromosome (Xi) in mammalian cells
adopts a seemingly similar structure with a ~200 kb hinge region
that is organized into euchromatin, while the surrounding chro-
mosome is in a heterochromatic state55. However, the domain
boundary on P. falciparum chromosome 14 is sharp, does not
have a distinct hinge region, and is not surrounded by H3K9me3
marking. In support of the hypothesis that boundary formation is
sex-specific, we discovered that the homolog of ApiAP2 tran-
scription factor PF3D7_1429200 (PfAP2-O3) in P. berghei is
strictly female-specific, suggesting that PfAP2-O3 controls female
gametocyte differentiation. A few hundred genes are differentially
expressed between male and female gametocytes56,57 and could
be under the control of this protein, either through direct tran-
scriptional regulation or through selective stabilization of female-
specific transcripts. Interestingly, disruption of ap2-o3 in P. ber-
ghei resulted in differential gene expression in gametocytes and
reduced gametocyte levels, although the sex ratio was not influ-
enced38. However, pfap2-03 is located approximately 40 kb from
the domain boundary and it is not directly clear if and how
expression of this gene would be influenced by the formation of
these superdomains.
An alternative hypothesis is that the domain boundary is
involved in regulation of the nearby gene Pf3D7_1430100
(pfptpa). PfPTPA has been shown to bind and activate PP2A, and
to block the G2/M transition58. The transition from rapidly
dividing asexual parasites into cell cycle arrested gametocytes is
likely to require tight cell cycle regulation by a protein such as
PTPA. Given the differences in pfptpa expression between the
IDC and gametocyte stages, we speculate that the domain
boundary inside or close to this gene may be important for
driving the expression of this gene, which may in turn activate
PP2A to block cell division in gametocytes. In ongoing efforts, we
are further investigating the role of the domain boundary in gene
expression and gametocyte differentiation.
From an evolutionary perspective, P. falciparum and P. vivax
are highly divergent within the family of Plasmodium species59,60.
Salivary gland sporozoites maintain a relatively quiescent tran-
scriptional state, waiting for injection into the human blood-
stream and invasion of a hepatocyte before ramping up
transcriptional activity. Our interpretation of the numerous long-
range interactions in the sporozoite stage is that the majority of
the genome is transcriptionally repressed, with the exception of
several active loci that colocalize in transcriptional islands, giving
rise to long-range interactions. The observation that the genes
involved in these long-range interactions are not each other’s
homologs in P. falciparum and P. vivax is suggestive of species-
specific gene expression and warrants further investigation.
To fully understand transcriptional regulation, it is of great
interest to unravel the causal relationship between genome
organization and transcriptional activity. In multicellular organ-
isms, evidence is accumulating that certain aspects of genome
organization are independent of transcription61. In addition,
disruptions in genome structure that bring together previously
isolated promoters and enhancers can result in gene activation62.
It will be important to determine to what extent genome orga-
nization controls transcriptional activity in P. falciparum. Our
findings bring a new level of insight into genome dynamics
during the Plasmodium life cycle and open up new avenues for
targeted approaches towards understanding parasite gene reg-
ulation. In addition, molecules inhibiting the (re-)structuring of
the genome have the potential to act as potent transmission-
blocking antimalarials.
Methods
Experimental procedures. Parasite strains and cultures: The P. falciparum strain
NF54 (obtained from the MR4 malaria repository) was cultured at 5–10% para-
sitemia in human O+ erythrocytes at 5% haematocrit. The induction of gametocyte-
stage parasites was performed by sorbitol synchronization and culturing in a low
medium volume (see Supplementary Methods). Stage IV/V gametocytes at 2%
parasitemia were isolated from 150 ml of culture using a percoll gradient, were
cultured for one additional day, and were then isolated by magnetic purification
yielding 6.25 × 108 parasites (Supplementary Fig. 1). To obtain sporozoites, adult
female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were allowed to feed on P. falciparum NF54
gametocyte cultures. Sporozoites were harvested from infected mosquitoes
14–19 days later. Stage II/III gametocytes were obtained using the P. falciparum
NF54Pfs16 reporter gene line63. Gametocytes were isolated by magnetic purification,
yielding 1.17 × 108 parasites with high purity (>95% gametocytes) as determined by
GFP expression (Supplementary Fig. 1). To obtain P. vivax sporozoites, female
Anopheles cracens mosquitoes were fed on blood samples drawn from P. vivax
infected patients who had given written informed consent and who attended a
Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) clinic in Mawker Thai or Wang Pha, on the
western Thailand-Myanmar border. The research protocol was approved by Oxford
Tropical Research Ethics Committee and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Two biological replicates containing 21,583,075 and 29,245,000 sporozoites,
respectively, were used for Hi-C experiments. Fifteen days post-infection, P. vivax
sporozoites were harvested from An. cracens salivary glands. The construction of P.
falciparum 3D7 transgenic strain PfHP1-GFP-DD has been described previously26.
Parasites were synchronized, split into two populations at 4–12 hpi and cultured in
the presence or absence of Shield-1 as described. Parasites were harvested for Hi-C
at 4–12 hpi in the next cell cycle. More details about parasite cultures and collections
are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Hi-C procedure: Parasites were crosslinked in 1.25% formaldehyde in warm
PBS for 25 min on a rocking platform in a total volume between 1 and 10 ml,
depending on the number of parasites harvested. Glycine was added to a final
concentration as 150 mM, followed by 15 min of incubation at 37 °C and 15 min of
incubation at 4 °C, both steps on a rocking platform. The parasites were centrifuged
at 660×g for 20 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold PBS, and
incubated for 10 min at 4 °C on a rocking platfrom. Parasites were centrifuged at
660×g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed once in ice-cold PBS, and stored as a pellet at
−80 °C. For late stage gametocytes, the crosslinking protocol was slightly modified.
Late gametocytes were collected in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM
NaCl, 2 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl (AEBSF), 1% Igepal
CA-360 (v/v), and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) and incubated
for 10 min at RT. After homogenization by 15 needle passages, formaldehyde was
added to a final concentration of 1.25%, followed by 10 more needle passages. The
protocol was then continued as for all other samples. To map the inter-
chromosomal and intrachromosomal contact counts, crosslinked parasites were
subjected to the tethered conformation capture procedure, using MboI for
restriction digests, as described in detail in the Supplementary Methods.
DNA-FISH: DNA-FISH experiments were performed as previously described16.
In brief, probes were prepared using Fluorescein-High Prime and Biotin-High
Prime kits (Roche) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Template DNA was
prepared by PCR (5 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 98 °C, followed by 150 s at 62 °
C, and 5 min at 62 °C) using the KAPA HiFi DNA Polymerase HotStart ReadyMix.
Sequences of primers used for probe generation are shown in Supplementary
Table 5. Double sorbitol synchronized ring-stage parasites were extracted using
0.015% saponin in cold PBS, washed in cold PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in
PBS at RT. A monolayer of parasites was deposited on a 9 × 9 mm frame-seal slide
chamber on a standard microscopy slide and air-dried. Parasites were
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After application of the denatured
probes, the slides were denatured at 80 °C for 30 min followed by hybridization at
37 °C overnight. The slides were washed, equilibrated, washed in TNT solution,
stained with DAPI and mounted.
Immunofluorescence microscopy: P. falciparum IDC-stage parasites and
gametocytes were fixed onto slides using 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at RT.
Slides were washed three times using 1× PBS. The parasites were permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton-X for 30 min at RT, followed by a wash step with 1× PBS.
Samples were blocked overnight at 4 °C in IFA buffer (2% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20,
100 mM glycine, 3 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 1× PBS). Cells were incubated
with anti-Histone H3 antibody (ab8898 (Abcam), 1:500 or 07–442 (Millipore),
1:500) for 1 h at RT followed by anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies
A11008; 1:500). No differences were observed in the results obtained with the two
primary antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 12). Slides were mounted in Vectashield
mounting medium with DAPI. Images were acquired using an Olympus BX40
epifluorescence microscope.
H3K9me3 ChIP-seq: Asexual parasites were crosslinked for 10 min with 1%
formaldehyde in PBS at 37 °C, while gametocytes were crosslinked with 1.25%
formaldehyde in lysis buffer for 25 min at RT. Chromatin was sheared using the
Covaris Ultra Sonicator (S220). ChIP was performed using 2 μg of anti-Histone
H3K9me3 antibody (ab8898 (Abcam) for biological replicates #1 and 07–442
(Millipore) for biological replicates #2) or no antibody as a negative control. Details
are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

 P. falciparum strain 3D7, from a mixed blood stage culture of P. falciparum strain
NF54, and from a stage II/III gametocyte culture of P. falciparum strain NF54 using
the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen). PCR amplifications were performed using
50 ng of genomic DNA, 0.4 μM of each primer (see Supplementary Table 5), and
HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems) with the following program: 5 min at
95 °C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, 2 min at 62 °C and a final extension of
6 min at 62 °C. Genomic DNA (100 ng) was digested with restriction enzyme
DraIII (NEB), purified using the DNA genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator kit
(Zymo Research), and separated by DNA electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel
(100 min at 35 V). The DNA was transferred to charged nylon membrane by
upward capillary transfer. The DNA probe was generated by PCR amplification
using 10 ng of genomic DNA, 0.4 μM of each primer (see Supplementary Table 5),
0.425 mM biotinylated dCTP, and HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems)
with the following program: 3 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 20 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 58 °C,
30 s at 62 °C and a final extension of 5 min at 62 °C. The membrane was incubated
with 25 ng/ml probe in PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma) overnight at
60 °C. The membrane was blocked with 5× Casein blocking buffer (Sigma) and
incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:2000). The membrane was
developed using Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE
Healthcare).
Validation of sex-specific ApiAP2 TF in P. berghei: Transgenic parasites
endogenously expressing a GFP-tagged version of the P. berghei homolog of
Pf3D7_1429200 (PBANKA_1015500) were generated by single homologous
recombination64. A 1323 bp region of PBANKA_1015500 omitting the stop codon
was PCR amplified on genomic DNA using primers T2191 (5′-
CCCCGGTACCGAATGCCCTAATAAATCTATTTCAATAG, KpnI site
underlined) and T2192 (5′-
CCCCGGGCCCATATTTTTTTGGTCGTTGGAAATTAAAC, ApaI site
underlined). This was inserted upstream of the gfp sequence in the p277 vector
using KpnI and ApaI restriction sites as underlined in the primers. The p277 vector
contains the human dhfr cassette, conveying resistance to pyrimethamine. Before
transfection, the sequence was linearized using ClaI. For the endogenously C-
terminal fusion GFP-tagged parasites, a diagnostic PCR reaction was used as
illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 15C. Primers INT T219 (5′-
CAAATGATATTATCCCTTATATTGAAAG) and ol492 (5′-
ACGCTGAACTTGTGGCCG) were used to determine correct fusion of the gfp
sequence at the targeted locus by single homologous recombination. The presence
of the full-length gene was verified using primers INT T219 and T2192. Asexual
proliferation and gametocytogenesis were analysed using blood smears.
Gametocyte activation and zygote formation were monitored using in vitro cultures
and the surface antigen P28. Blood stages were stained in schizont medium for 60
min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with respective medium and resuspended in
PBS containing Hoechst 33342 DNA stain before being mounted for fluorescent
microscopy. Six-to-eight-week-old female Tuck-Ordinary (TO) or NIHS (Harlan)
outbred mice were used for all experiments. All animal work at Nottingham has
passed an ethical review process and was approved by the United Kingdom Home
Office. Work was carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom “Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986” and in compliance with “European Directive 86/
609/EEC” for the protection of animals used for experimental purposes under UK
Home Office Project Licenses (30/3248). Sodium pentabarbitol was used for
terminal anesthesia and a combination of ketamine followed by antisedan was used
for general anesthesia.
Computational methods. We mapped and binned reads and created and ICE-
normalized contact count matrices as previously described (ref. 16 and Supple-
mentary Information). A consensus 3D genome structure was inferred for each of
the transmission stages and the three IDC stages using Pastis20. Pastis uses a
maximum likelihood approach based on modeling contacts using a negative
binomial model to account for the observed overdispersion. This method generates
more accurate and robust structures when compared to the optimization-based
approach we used previously16. To identify significant contacts, we modeled the
effect of genomic distance on contact count probability with a spline using fit-hi-
c19. Because of the possibility of differing statistical power between datasets, we
report both the number of significant contacts above a given threshold, as well as
the percent of significant contacts meeting a criterion (e.g., between pfap2 gene loci
and virulence clusters) out of all significant contacts. Significant co-localization
of gene sets was assessed using previously developed tests (refs.21,65, and Supple-
mentary Information).
We developed ACCOST (altered chromatin conformation statistics) to estimate
the statistical significance of differences in contact counts between samples, taking
as inspiration the negative binomial-based tests used for RNA-seq data66–68.
Briefly, we modeled each bin as a negative binomial random variable, and we
estimated the relationship between the mean and variance by grouping pairs of loci
that are separated by the same linear genomic distance. We adapted the model
employed by DESeq to Hi-C data by using an explicit specific scaling factor
corresponding to bin-specific ICE biases. In addition, we estimated variance and
dispersion of the negative binomial without replicates by assuming that most bins
at a given genomic distance act similarly. Contact count matrices were subsampled
to account for differences in interaction counts measured at the various stages and
only intrachromosomal contacts for which the sum of the contacts was above the
80% percentile were tested. The resulting fold-change values were filtered after FDR
estimation to only include loci that show a two-fold or larger difference in contacts,
after normalizing for the effect of genomic distance, with a false discovery rate of
less than 1% (Supplementary Data 3). For details of the model and implementation,
see Supplementary Information.
