IMPORTANCE Surgeons are frequently faced with clinical adverse events owing to the nature
of their specialty, yet not all surgeons disclose these events to patients. To sustain open
disclosure programs, it is essential to understand how surgeons are disclosing adverse events,
factors that are associated with reporting such events, and the effect of disclosure on
surgeons.
OBJECTIVE To quantitatively assess surgeons’ reports of disclosure of adverse events and
aspects of their experiences with the disclosure process.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational study was conducted from January 1,
2011, to December 31, 2013, involving a 21-item baseline questionnaire administered to 67 of
75 surgeons (89%) representing 12 specialties at 3 Veterans Affairs medical centers.
Sixty-two surveys of their communication about adverse events and experiences with
disclosing such events were completed by 35 of these 67 surgeons (52%). Data were
analyzed using mixed linear random-effects and logistic regression models.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reports of disclosure assessed by 8 items from
guidelines and pilot research, surgeons’ perceptions of the adverse event, reported personal
effects from disclosure, and baseline attitudes toward disclosure.
RESULTS Most of the surgeons completing the web-based surveys (41 responses from men
and 21 responses from women) used 5 of the 8 recommended disclosure items: explained
why the event happened (55 of 60 surveys [92%]), expressed regret for what happened
(52 of 60 [87%]), expressed concern for the patient’s welfare (57 of 60 [95%]), disclosed the
adverse event within 24 hours (58 of 60 [97%]), and discussed steps taken to treat any
subsequent problems (59 of 60 [98%]). Fewer surgeons apologized to patients (33 of 60
[55%]), discussed whether the event was preventable (33 of 60 [55%]), or how recurrences
could be prevented (19 of 59 [32%]). Surgeons who were less likely to have discussed
prevention (33 of 60 [55%]), those who stated the event was very or extremely serious
(40 of 61 surveys [66%]), or reported very or somewhat difficult experiences discussing the
event (16 of 61 [26%]) were more likely to have been negatively affected by the event.
Surgeons with more negative attitudes about disclosure at baseline reported more anxiety
about patients’ surgical outcomes or events following disclosure (odds ratio, 1.54;
95% CI, 1.16-2.06).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Surgeons who reported they were less likely to discuss
preventability of the adverse event, or who reported difficult communication experiences,
were more negatively affected by disclosure than others. Quality improvement efforts
focused on recognizing the association between disclosure and surgeons’ well-being may
help sustain open disclosure policies.

N
ational guidelines recommend full disclosure of ad-
verseeventsorunanticipatedoutcomestopatientsand
theirfamilymembers.1,2Evidenceshowsthatsuchfull
disclosure involving transparent and honest communication
benefits patients and families.3,4 Nonetheless, physicians, in-
cluding surgeons, frequently fail to disclose adverse events to
their patients.5-10 Even when physicians report favorable at-
titudes toward disclosure, they often do not tell patients all the
details about a clinical adverse event.5
The National Quality Forum provides guidelines for the
content of disclosures to patients, which includes providing
facts about the event to patients and families, including
whether or not an error or system failure occurred, and re-
sults of any event analysis to support informed decision-
making by the patient; expressing regret for the outcome; and
giving a formal apology if the unanticipated outcome was
caused by an error or system failure.1,7 The Department of Vet-
erans Affairs (VA) handbook, Disclosure of Adverse Events to Pa-
tients, instructs the clinical team to provide factual informa-
tion to the extent it is known, express concern for the patient’
s
welfare, and reassure the patient or representative that steps
are being taken to investigate the situation, remedy any in-
jury, and prevent further harm.11 However, to our knowledge,
few studies have examined the content of surgeons’disclo-
sures of adverse events, and it remains unknown which ele-
ments of disclosure are used by surgeons during these con-
versations, or how such disclosure affects patients and
physicians.
Many researchers have argued that disclosure is as impor-
tant for physicians as it is for patients,12 stating that disclo-
sure provides an outlet for the emotional toll that physicians
experience as part of the adverse event process.13,14 Physi-
cians may fear that disclosing adverse events increases the risk
of negative consequences related to the adverse event,15 with
physicians being considered the “second victims.”16 After ad-
verse events, surgeons may experience burnout, shame, guilt,
and even depression, contributed to by litigation and con-
cerns, as well as colleagues’reactions.17-19 A survey adminis-
tered to 108 surgery, emergency medicine, and anesthesiol-
ogy physicians at one hospital showed that 85 (78.7%) had
experienced either a serious adverse patient event and/or a
traumatic personal event within the previous year.20 Many of
these physicians reported several barriers to seeking support
for these events, including a perceived negative effect on their
careers, stigma, and lack of confidentiality in the process. An
emotional toll may also be taken when no explicit medical er-
ror has occurred, or when an adverse event is potentially
unpreventable.21
This study provides information on how surgeons de-
scribe aspects of their experiences with disclosures of ad-
verse surgical events, in the absence of specific training on dis-
closure. We sought to test whether surgeons who reported
adverse events using elements of disclosure advocated by the
National Quality Forum and VA were less likely to experience
negative effects after disclosure (eg, increased anxiety),
whether surgeons who reported more negative perceptions
about adverse events (eg, perceived seriousness of the event)
and disclosure (eg, more difficulty discussing the event) were
more likely to experience negative effects after disclosure, and
whether surgeons who reported positive attitudes toward dis-
closure were less likely to experience negative effects after dis-
closure. Examining disclosure of adverse events and its ef-
fects from the surgeon’
s perspective may inform efforts to
improve the disclosure process as well as both surgeons’and
patients’outcomes following disclosure.
Methods
Setting
This prospective study took place at 3 VA medical centers in
the United States from January 1, 2011, through December 31,
2013. Twelve surgical specialties—cardiac, general, gynecol-
ogy, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic, otolaryngol-
ogy, plastics, podiatry, thoracic, urology, and vascular—are
practicedatthesefacilities.ThestudywasapprovedbytheVet-
erans Affairs Boston Health Care System, Veterans Affairs Con-
necticut Health Care System, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound
Health Care System, and Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Vet-
erans Hospital (Bedford, Massachusetts) Institutional Re-
view Boards, and a certificate of confidentiality from the Na-
tionalInstitutesofHealthwasobtainedtoprotecttheidentities
of participating surgeons.
Surgeon Recruitment
We obtained lists of surgeons from each medical center’
s sur-
gical service (n = 75) and introduced the study to these sur-
geons at group informational meetings. Individual meetings
were then scheduled whereby a study team member further
explained the study’
s objectives. Participating surgeons pro-
vided written informed consent and completed a baseline 21-
item questionnaire. We aimed to recruit surgeons from many
specialtiestoincreasethenumberofparticipants,decreasethe
risk of confidentiality breaches, and examine disclosures
among a range of surgeons.
Adverse Surgical Events for Study
Surgeons were asked to identify a case involving an un-
planned return to the operating room or an unplanned proce-
dural intervention following surgery, any time within 30 days
Key Points
Question How are surgeons disclosing adverse events to patients,
and what is the effect of such disclosure on surgeons’ well-being?
Findings In this observational study of surgeons at Veterans
Affairs facilities who completed 62 web-based surveys about their
experiences disclosing adverse events to patients, those who were
less likely to follow nationally recommended elements of
disclosure were more likely to report being negatively affected by
the adverse event.
Meaning Open disclosure programs are being implemented
nationwide, but without training on disclosing adverse events
using specific communication elements, surgeons may experience
negative effects when disclosing such information.

of the original surgery. These criteria were kept broad to cap-
ture a multitude of events. Quality assurance information on
facility adverse event reporting was unavailable to the study
team, following 38 USC § 5705 (2010) (federal statutes on con-
fidentiality of medical quality assurance records)22; there-
fore, surgeons’self-reports of disclosures were required. Sur-
geonscontactedtheirsitestudyteamwithin2weeksofadverse
event identification to complete a web-based survey about the
disclosure. Emails were periodically sent to participating sur-
geons to remind them of this study process. This process ad-
hered to strict institutional review board guidelines to pro-
tect surgeons’confidentiality and to reduce coercion for study
participation.
Data Collection
Baseline Attitude Questionnaire
Attitude questions were adapted from a published survey23
and were collected in response to 2 vignettes representing
scenarios with the potential for high harm and low harm
(eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). Research shows that physi-
cians are more likely to disclose adverse events with the
potential for high harm to patients rather than those with the
potential for low harm.23 The scenario with potential for high
harm involved a surgical sponge retained during surgery but
not discovered until postoperative day 8. Additional surgery
was needed, and the patient did not fare well. The scenario
with potential for low harm involved significant intraopera-
tive blood loss that was corrected through autologous blood
transfusion, and the patient recovered well. Following
guidelines, scores from this questionnaire were divided into
2 subscales: a scale called positive attitudes toward disclo-
sure, a continuous scale ranging from 4 to 20, with higher
scores denoting more positive attitudes, and the other called
negative attitudes toward disclosure, a categorical scale rang-
ing from 0 to 6, with lower scores denoting more negative
attitudes.
Web-Based Survey
Once a surgeon reported disclosing an adverse event, a confi-
dential survey web link created specifically for that surgeon
and event was sent via email. Participants could complete up
to 3 web-based surveys for 3 adverse events and disclosures
during the study period. This 22-item survey was developed
based on a qualitative pilot study of actual adverse event
disclosures24 and other previous work (eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement).8,9 This survey documented surgeons’experi-
ences of adverse events, their perceived seriousness of the
events (from 1 [not at all serious] to 4 [extremely serious]),
and whether they discussed the 8 different elements of dis-
closures identified through pilot interviews and disclosure
guidelines from the National Quality Forum and VA (yes or no
response). These 8 items ask (1) whether the surgeon
explained why the event happened, (2) whether the event
was preventable, (3) how recurrences of the event could be
prevented, (4) whether the surgeon expressed regret for what
happened, (5) whether the surgeon expressed concern for the
patient’
s welfare, (6) whether the surgeon apologized for the
event, (7) whether the event was disclosed within 24 hours,
and (8) whether the surgeon discussed steps taken to treat
any subsequent problems. Each of these items was treated as
a single-item scale in our analyses.
Several questions, validated in a previous study,9 also as-
sessed the effect on surgeons from the event and its disclo-
sure. Questions included how much disclosure of the event af-
fected them overall on a scale of 1 (extremely) to 5 (not at all),
whether there had been an overall negative effect on their life
from this event (yes or no response), and questions (yes or no
response) about whether disclosure affected their job satis-
faction, their confidence in their ability as a physician, their
professional reputation, their anxiety about future outcomes
or events, and their ability to sleep.9 These items were treated
as single-item scales in our data analysis. The survey in-
cluded demographic questions (age, sex, and surgical spe-
cialty), and included a text box for a description of the event.
Pilot testing determined that the survey took between 2 and
5 minutes to complete.
Statistical Analysis
We performed descriptive analyses of the distribution of sur-
geon demographics and for the baseline and web-based sur-
veys to determine the range of responses among surgeon par-
ticipants across the 3 study sites. In addition, we examined the
residual plots and normal probability plots of the studen-
tized residuals, which revealed no evidence of nonlinearity;
the normal probability plots raised no concerns about the con-
ditionalnormalityassumptionsofthedependentvariables.We
then performed 2 sets of analyses on the survey data, with the
disclosure event as our unit of analysis to test our hypoth-
eses. The first set consisted of separate random-effects least-
squares regressions of surgeons’reports of the overall effect
of the event on surgeons’experience of disclosing the event,
as well as their perceptions of the event. The second analysis
consisted of random-effects logistic regressions of surgeons’
reports of whether they experienced an overall negative ef-
fect on their lives from the event or negative effect on spe-
cific aspects (ie, job satisfaction, confidence, reputation, anxi-
ety, and ability to sleep) on their experience of disclosing the
event, and surgeons’baseline attitude scales by high- or low-
harmscenario.Bothsetsofmodelscontrolledforsurgeons’age
and sex and included separate normally distributed random-
effects for each surgeon. All analyses were conducted using
the SAS statistical package (SAS Institute); the random-
effects least-squares regressions were implemented in PROC
MIXED,andtherandom-effectslogisticregressionswereimple-
mented in PROC GLIMMIX. The multiplicity of tests was ad-
dressed by performing a false discovery rate adjustment to the
P values, an increasingly common procedure for multiple test
corrections.25,26
Results
Sixty-seven of 75 surgeons (89%) across the study sites and
representing each of the 12 surgical specialties consented to
participate in the study and completed a baseline question-
naire assessing their attitudes toward disclosure of adverse

events.23 Of 67 eligible surgeons, 35 (52%) from 11 specialties
completed 62 web-based surveys reporting on their disclo-
sures of adverse events to patients and/or family members.
eAppendix 3 in the Supplement contains descriptive statis-
tics of study participants based on the 62 surveys (surgeons
could complete up to 3 surveys). There were no significant
sex differences between those who completed the web-based
survey and those who did not (χ2
1 = 1.59, P = .21).
Adverse Event and Disclosure Experiences
Thirty-six of 60 survey respondents (60%) indicated that the
adverse event had affected them moderately, quite a bit, or ex-
tremely,butmostdidnotreportsignificanteffectsinareassuch
asjobsatisfaction,confidence,professionalreputation,orabil-
ity to sleep. Seventeen of 62 survey respondents (27%) re-
ported anxiety about future outcomes or events (eAppendix
4 in the Supplement).
Disclosure Reports
Most participating surgeons reported that they used 5 of the
8 recommended disclosure items: explained why the event
happened (55 of 60 surveys [92%]), expressed regret for what
happened (52 of 60 [87%]), expressed concern for the pa-
tient’
s welfare (57 of 60 [95%]), disclosed the adverse event
within 24 hours (58 of 60 [97%]), and discussed steps taken
to treat any subsequent problems (59 of 60 [98%]) (eAppen-
dix 5 in the Supplement). Fewer surgeons discussed whether
the event was preventable (33 of 60 surveys [55%]) and/or how
recurrences of the event could be prevented (19 of 59 [32%]).
Although VA guidelines do not mention apology, 33 of 60 sur-
vey respondents (55%) indicated that they apologized to the
patient during disclosure.
Attitudes Toward Disclosure
Surgeons reported more positive attitudes toward disclosure
in the high-harm scenario (mean [SD] score, 19.76 [0.82])
than in the low-harm scenario (mean [SD] score, 18.24 [2.57])
(t = –4.43; P < .001) (Table 1). There were no differences in
negative attitudes toward disclosure reported in either sce-
nario: surgeons’mean (SD) score for the high-harm scenario
was 2.90 (1.96), while their mean (SD) score for the low-harm
scenario was 2.53 (2.13) (t = –1.01; P = .32) (Table 2).
Predictors of Surgeons’ Experiences
Surgeons reported being significantly affected by disclosure
when they perceived that the adverse event was more seri-
ous (β = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.31-0.90), reported very or somewhat
difficult experiences when discussing the event with the
patient and/or family (β = –0.61; 95% CI, –1.00 to –0.23), did
not discuss with the patient or family whether the event was
preventable (β = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.39-1.61), and did not discuss
how recurrences of the event could be prevented (β = 1.39;
95% CI, 0.70-2.08) (Table 3). Clinically, this result means that
the contribution of the predictor variable (ie, seriousness of
the event, difficult experiences with disclosure, and no dis-
cussion of preventability) is significantly positive, and that
each 1-point increase in the predictor variable corresponds to
an additional increase (range, 0.60-1.39) in surgeons being

negatively affected by the event. Moreover, surgeons who
reported very difficult experiences when discussing the event
were 4 times more likely to report that the event had a nega-
tive effect on their lives (odds ratio, 4.09; 95% CI, 1.72-9.72)
(Table 4). Surgeons who reported more negative attitudes
toward disclosing an adverse event in a low-harm setting at
baseline reported greater anxiety about future outcomes fol-
lowing disclosure (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16-2.06). There
were no significant results reported for any of the remaining

Discussion
Wefoundthatmostofthesurgeonsinthisstudyreportedusing
5 of the 8 recommended communication items during disclo-
sure that had been identified as important by surgeons and pa-
tients in previous pilot interviews and that were part of the Na-
tional Quality Forum and VA guidelines. The 3 items that were
not as commonly discussed—apologizing to the patient, dis-
cussing whether the event was preventable, and discussing
how recurrences of the event could be prevented—are viewed
as more challenging communication items, but nonetheless
criticalelementsofdisclosurethatpatientshaveindicatedthey
prefer to hear.6,7,15,27-29 To our knowledge, VA surgeons par-
ticipating in this study had not been trained on disclosure of
adverse events. Therefore, it would be surprising if many sur-
geons were consistently including all 8 recommended items
in their disclosures.
Participants indicated that they had difficulty communi-
cating about preventability of the adverse event with patients.
Surgeons may not have known whether the event was pre-
ventable (since not all reported cases were medical errors) or
what steps could be taken to prevent its recurrence. Surgeons
may also have thought that discussing prevention and recur-
rences was too difficult, perhaps because it might suggest
blame for the event. However, since these elements of disclo-
sure are specifically mentioned as key elements in guidelines,
and patients have indicated wanting to know how an event
occurred, not just that it did,28,29 it is important to know that
not all surgeons are disclosing this information. Furthermore,
we found that not disclosing this information is associated
with surgeons feeling more negatively affected by the adverse

event. The Disclosure Training Program, recently dissemi-
nated across 26 VA medical centers, would be a next step for
training surgeons on how to discuss challenging issues such
as preventability of adverse events.30 Creating a culture of
professionalism that allows for self-care following disclosures
may also increase surgeons’well-being, as has been done in
other large health care systems.31
Surgeons who perceived an adverse event to be ex-
tremely or very serious also reported being negatively af-
fected by the event. This finding makes sense: in general, sur-
geons strive for perfection, and an association exists between
aperfectionistpersonalitytypeandchoosingsurgeryasamedi-
cal specialty.32 Indeed, when surgeons reported experiencing
difficult conversations disclosing adverse events, they also re-
ported being more negatively affected by the event. Surgeons
also may not have known what information to disclose, indi-
catingthatgreatertrainingtosupportsurgeonsmaybeneeded.

tudes toward disclosure in a situation where it would be pos-
sible to not inform patients or family members of the adverse
event (eg, low-harm events where the patient recovers well)
were more likely to report anxiety following disclosure. There
are certain events that mandate a disclosure, and the high-
harm (retained sponge) scenario is one of them. Nearly all sur-
geons reported that they would disclose this event. In the low-
harm (blood loss) scenario, the patient recovered well, and
discussing this event may have been perceived as unneces-
sary by many surgeons in our study. It is possible that many ad-
verse events are also categorized by surgeons as low harm vs
highharm.However,ifdisclosureisdeemednecessarybyahos-
pital’
s patient safety or risk management team, surgeons with
morenegativeattitudestowarddisclosurewouldfindthiscom-
munication more difficult, and, as in our study, might report
greater anxiety about future outcomes or events as a result of
having had this unwelcome conversation with patients.
Our study has some limitations. This is not a study of the
entire VA surgical service but only of surgeons employed at 3
facilitieswhovoluntarilyparticipatedandinformedstudystaff
whenanadverseeventanddisclosureoccurred.Title38ofUSC
§ 5705 (2010) protects quality assurance information on ad-
verseevents22;therefore,wewerenotabletocapturetherange
ofadverseeventsoccurringinourstudy.Moreover,ourhetero-
geneous sample does not allow us to examine how surgeons
in certain specialties are disclosing adverse events. Although
our 52% response rate is higher than in other published sur-
veys of surgeons (eg, 32%),17 achieving a greater response rate
across more sites is desirable. We would expect that a wider
range of surgeons’experiences with disclosure would be more
variable and potentially include more negative events. An-
other limitation is that although VA physicians are protected
under the Federal Tort Claim Act, they are not protected from
reporting to the National Practitioner Data Bank. Examining
disclosuresamongsurgeonsinotherhealthcaresystemswhere
greater protection for one’
s reputation may be provided is an-
other necessary step in this line of research.
Conclusions
Much progress has been made toward physicians responding
to demands for transparency and openness with patients, no
matter what events take place during their medical care. How-
ever, very little has been done, overall, to assess physicians’
experiences with disclosing actual adverse events to pa-
tients, a situation that requires skills in immediate, transpar-
ent,opencommunication,andtodeterminewhetherthesedis-
closures are following recommended guidelines. By
emphasizing the potential for surgeons being negatively af-
fected after adverse events and disclosures, and recognizing
the association between attitudes, perceived seriousness of
events, surgeons’experiences with disclosures, and training
on how to include specific elements of disclosure in these dif-
ficult conversations, future quality improvement efforts may
be able to help sustain the implementation of open disclo-
sure programs nationwide33,34 while also ensuring a healthy
surgeon workforce.
