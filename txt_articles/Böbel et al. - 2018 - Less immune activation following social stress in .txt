Urbanization is on the rise, and environments offering a narrow
range of microbial exposures are linked to an increased prevalence
of both physical and mental disorders. Human and animal studies
suggest that an overreactive immune system not only accom-
panies stress-associated disorders but might even be causally
involved in their pathogenesis. Here, we show in young [mean
age, years (SD): rural, 25.1 (0.78); urban, 24.5 (0.88)] healthy human
volunteers that urban upbringing in the absence of pets (n = 20),
relative to rural upbringing in the presence of farm animals (n =
20), was associated with a more pronounced increase in the num-
ber of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma
interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations following acute psychosocial
stress induced by the Trier social stress test (TSST). Moreover, ex
vivo-cultured PBMCs from urban participants raised in the absence
of animals secreted more IL-6 in response to the T cell-specific
mitogen Con A. In turn, antiinflammatory IL-10 secretion was sup-
pressed following TSST in urban participants raised in the absence
of animals, suggesting immunoregulatory deficits, relative to rural
participants raised in the presence of animals. Questionnaires,
plasma cortisol, and salivary α-amylase, however, indicated the
experimental protocol was more stressful and anxiogenic for rural
participants raised in the presence of animals. Together, our find-
ings support the hypothesis that urban vs. rural upbringing in the
absence or presence of animals, respectively, increases vulnerability
to stress-associated physical and mental disorders by compromis-
ing adequate resolution of systemic immune activation following
social stress and, in turn, aggravating stress-associated systemic
immune activation.
TSST | urban | rural | inflammation | old friends
M
ore than 50% of the world’s population currently lives in
urban areas, projected to rise to 70% by 2050, with 50%
of the urban population living in cities with more than
500,000 residents (1). At the same time, psychiatric disorders are
more prevalent in urban vs. rural areas (2, 3). Given that psy-
chosocial stress is a risk factor for many mental disorders (4), an
altered neuronal social processing or an elevated acute cortisol
stress response provide two possible distinct mechanisms un-
derlying the higher urban prevalence of psychiatric disorders (5,
6). However, a lack of long-term and early-life exposure to stables
and farm milk is also known to promote chronic inflammatory
disorders, including asthma and allergies (7). Moreover,
many stress-associated mental disorders are accompanied by an
overreactive immune system and chronic low-grade inflammation
(8, 9). Prospective human and mechanistic animal studies
strengthen the idea that an exaggerated immune (re)activity
plays a role in the development of mental disorders (10, 11).
For example, individual differences in interleukin 6 (IL-6) se-
cretion from ex vivo-stimulated immune cells predict suscepti-
bility vs. resilience to a subsequently applied repeated social
stressor in mice, while treatment with an anti–IL-6 antibody in-
creases stress resilience (12). Furthermore, it is known that
psychosocial stress promotes systemic immune activation and
chronic low-grade inflammation (13), and that IL-6 responses to
psychosocial stressors, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST)
are exaggerated in those with a diagnosis of major depressive
disorder and increased early life stress (8). Therefore, another
possible mechanism predisposing those with an urban upbringing,
relative to those with a rural upbringing, to develop mental dis-
orders in which inflammation has been identified as a risk factor, is
an exaggerated inflammatory response following psychosocial
stress exposure. Increased inflammation in urban environments
may be due to impaired immunoregulation, which is thought to be
dependent, at least in part, on reduced exposure, especially during
early life (14), to microorganisms with which mammals coevolved,
as has been proposed by the “biodiversity” hypothesis (15),
Significance
Our results show that a standardized laboratory psychosocial
stressor causes a greater inflammatory response in young
healthy participants with an urban upbringing in the absence
of pets, relative to young healthy participants with a rural
upbringing in the presence of farm animals. In view of the
known links between persistent inflammatory states and
psychiatric disturbances, and considering that many stress-
associated physical and mental disorders are more prevalent
in environments offering a narrow range of microbial expo-
sures, we feel that our findings are of general interest and
significance. Moreover, we feel our study is timely, as urbani-
zation and the associated socioeconomic consequences are
increasing.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 “missing-microbes” hypothesis (16), or “old-friends” hypothesis
(17, 18), which all have been evoked to explain the epidemic of
inflammatory disease in urban environments. Throughout hu-
man evolution, the interactions between these ancestral micro-
biota and the innate immune system promoted immunoregulation,
as they were either part of host physiology (human microbiota),
were harmless but inevitably contaminating air, food, and water
(environmental microbiota), or were causing severe tissue damage
when attacked by the host immune system (helminthic parasites)
(16, 18). However, microbial biodiversity and, thus, overall contact
with environmental and commensal microorganisms that were
present during mammalian evolution and that play a role in setting
up regulatory immune pathways, is progressively diminishing in
high-income countries, particularly in urban areas. The latter is
due to sanitation, drinking water treatment, excessive use of an-
tibiotics, changes in diet, feeding of formula milk as a replacement
for breast milk, increased caesarean section birth rates, as well as
increased time spent within the built environment (16, 18–20). Of
particular interest in this context is a recent study showing in-
creased innate immune system activation in Hutterite compared
with Amish farm children, and an ameliorating effect of dust ex-
tracts from Amish, but not Hutterite, homes on airway hyperre-
activity and eosinophilia in a mouse model of allergic asthma (21).
Living on single-family dairy farms with regular contact with farm
animals in Amish farm children further goes along with four and
six times lower asthma and allergic sensitization prevalence, re-
spectively, compared with living on highly industrialized farms
with little contact with farm animals in Hutterite farm children
(21). Thus, another critical factor contributing to the diminishing
contact with old friends in both urban and rural areas seems to be
regular contact with animals. In accordance with this hypothesis,
early exposure to both pets and farm animals is able to reduce the
risk of childhood asthma and other inflammatory disorders (22,
23). Immigrant studies further suggest that differential contact
with old friends, particularly during early life, accounts for
differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in rural
vs. urban environments (18, 24).
To test whether urban, compared with rural, upbringing in the
absence or presence of animals, respectively, is associated with
an increased immune response to social stress, we recruited
young, physically and emotionally healthy male participants
(Table S1), raised during the first 15 y of life either in a city with
more than 100,000 residents and in the absence of pets (urban)
or on a farm keeping farm animals (rural). Pets were excluded
for urban participants as they potently reduce the risk for in-
flammatory disorders (22), likely by facilitating contact with old
friends. Participants were individually exposed to the TSST (25),
and, before and after the TSST, heart rate and blood pressure
were assessed, blood was drawn for collection of plasma and
viable peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and saliva
samples were collected for determination of α-amylase (Fig. S1).
In addition, mental and physical health status, early life and
perceived life stress, and subjective strain induced by TSST
exposure were assessed using validated questionnaires (Fig. S1
and Table S2).
Materials and Methods
Recruiting. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Ulm Uni-
versity and is registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) (ID
DRKS00011236). For recruitment, a flyer was designed asking for healthy
male participants between 20 and 40 y of age who grew up (until the age of
15) either in a city with more than 100,000 residents and in the absence of
pets (urban: n = 20) or on a farm keeping farm animals (rural: n = 20). In-
terested participants were then called, and those who turned out to be
physically (asked whether they suffer from chronic physical disorders) and
emotionally healthy [Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders
(SCID-I) (telephone screening); Fig. S1 and Table S2], nonsmoking, caucasian,
nondrug taking (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, cannabis, etc.), non-
excessive exercising (i.e., <4 h per week), nontraumatized (during early life,
adolescence, and adulthood), nonacutely (within the last 6 mo) bereaved or
divorced, had a body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 30, gave their in-
formed consent, and were invited to participate in the present study (Table
S1). For further details, see SI Materials and Methods.
Experimental Procedure (Fig. S1). On the test day itself, basal physical and
emotional health statuses of the participants were assessed, employing
validated questionnaires [list of complaints for quantitative analysis of cur-
rent bodily and general complaints (BL); State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-
S) Questionnaire]. Before (−5 min) and after (5, 15, 60, 90, and 120 min) the
TSST, heart rate and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP) were assessed [for calculation of median arterial pressure
according to the formula: DBP + (SBP – DBP)/3], blood was drawn in EDTA-
and lithium heparin-coated monovettes for collection of plasma and PBMCs,
respectively, and saliva samples were collected for determination of α-am-
ylase concentration. After the fifth blood draw (90-min time point), STAI-S
was used again to assess subjective strain induced by the TSST procedure.
After the sixth blood draw (120 min), the catheter was removed, and mental
health status [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–German Version
(HADS-D); SCID-I (affective part)], early life [Childhood Experience of Care
and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA-Q); Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
(CTQ)], and perceived life stress [Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4)] were
assessed using validated questionnaires. For further details, see SI Materials
and Methods.
TSST. Acute psychosocial stress was induced using the TSST, which was per-
formed as described earlier (25), with minor modifications. For details, see SI
Materials and Methods.
Blood Pressure and Heart Rate. Blood pressure and heart rate of the partic-
ipants were determined at time points −5, 5, 15, 60, 90, and 120 min, using a
digital brachial blood pressure monitor (Boso Medicus Control; Bosch +
Sohn). For further details, see SI Materials and Methods.
Blood Draw. Blood (7.5 mL at each time point) was collected from an in-
dwelling venous catheter in the nondominant arm (inserted at −60 min) at
time points −5 min (5 min before the start of the TSST), 5 min (5 min after
termination of the TSST), 15 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min into chilled
EDTA-coated monovettes. The latter were centrifuged (1,000 × g/15 min,
4 °C) immediately after each blood draw, and plasma was aliquoted and
stored at −80 °C until further processing. Additionally, 9 mL of blood were
collected at each time point into lithium-heparin–coated monovettes and
stored at room temperature until blood from all time points was drawn for
subsequent isolation and ex vivo stimulation of PBMCs.
PBMC Isolation and Stimulation. Nine milliliters of blood were transferred
from lithium-heparin–coated monovettes into Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-
One), which were prepared beforehand with Ficoll Paque (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The number of
viable PBMCs (identified using trypan blue staining) was determined using
an automated cell counter (TC20 Automated Cell Counter; Bio-Rad Labora-
tories). A total of 2.5 × 105 cells was then cultured in 96-well plates, either
under basal conditions or in the presence of Con A (final concentration,
2.5 μg/mL) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (final concentration, 1 μg/mL) at 37 °C
and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Supernatants were collected afterward and stored at
−80 °C until further analysis. For further details, see SI Materials and Methods.
ELISA. Plasma samples and supernatants from PBMC stimulations were an-
alyzed using commercially available ELISA kits according to the manufac-
turers’ instructions. For further details, see SI Materials and Methods.
Determination of Salivary α-Amylase Concentrations. Salivary α-amylase as a
surrogate marker of sympathetic nervous system activity was measured as
described earlier (26). For further details, see SI Materials and Methods.
Statistics. For statistical comparisons, the software package IBM SPSS statistics
(version 22.0) and Stata (version 14.2 SE) (StataCorp 2016; StataCorp LP) were
used. For details, see SI Materials and Methods.

 not detect any differences in early life (CECA-Q, CTQ) or
perceived life stress (PSS-4) between groups (Fig. S1 and Table
S2). SCID-I and BL scores (Fig. S1 and Table S2), assessed
during telephone screening (SCID-I), at −60 min before TSST
(BL), or at 120 min after TSST (SCID-I), indicated that mental
and physical health status were also not affected by upbringing.
Effects of Upbringing and/or TSST on Emotionality. Anxiety levels in
the STAI-S, both at −60 (P = 0.014) and 90 (P = 0.005) min, and in
the HADS-D (P = 0.027) were higher in rural vs. urban participants
raised in the presence or absence of animals, respectively, as were
scores in threat (P = 0.005), challenge (P = 0.032), primary appraisal
(P = 0.004), and stress index (P = 0.025) in the Primary Appraisal
Secondary Appraisal Scale (PASA) (Fig. S1 and Table S2).
Effects of Upbringing and/or TSST on Systemic Immune Activation.
Basal numbers of viable PBMCs were not different between
groups. However, compared with basal values (at −5 min), while
PBMC counts in rural participants raised in the presence of
animals were increased only transiently at 5 min (P = 0.015),
PBMC counts in urban participants raised in the absence of
animals were increased at 5 (P < 0.001), 60 (P = 0.023), 90 (P =
0.018), and 120 min [P < 0.001; factor time: F(5,185) = 12.621, P <
0.001], resulting in higher PBMC counts in participants with an
urban, vs. rural, upbringing at 5 (P = 0.015), 60 (P = 0.040), and
120 min [P = 0.023; factor upbringing: F(1,37) = 5.272, P = 0.027;
factor time by upbringing: F(5,185) = 2.112, P = 0.066; Fig. 1A].
Basal plasma IL-6 concentrations were not different between
groups. Plasma IL-6 concentrations were increased in both ex-
perimental groups compared with respective basal values [factor
time: F(3,105) = 23.836, P < 0.001; Fig. 1B] at 60 (urban, P <
0.001; rural, P < 0.001) and 90 min (urban, P < 0.001; rural, P <
0.001). However, participants with an urban upbringing in the
absence of animals, relative to those with a rural upbringing in
the presence of animals, showed a prolonged increase in plasma
IL-6 concentrations compared with respective basal values at
120 min (P < 0.001), consistent with an overall interaction be-
tween upbringing and time [factor time by upbringing: F(3,105) =
3.118, P = 0.029; Fig. 1B].
Effects of Upbringing and/or TSST on ex Vivo PBMC Cytokine Release.
Basal ex vivo IL-6 secretion from isolated PBMCs (Fig. 2A) was
comparable between groups, and unaffected by TSST exposure.
Ex vivo IL-6 secretion from isolated PBMCs during Con A
[factor upbringing: F(1,37) = 13.728, P = 0.001; Fig. 2C], but not
LPS (Fig. 2B), stimulation was significantly increased in partic-
ipants with an urban vs. rural upbringing, in the absence or
presence of animals, respectively, at −5 (P = 0.012) and 120 min
(P = 0.029). Ex vivo IL-10 secretion from isolated PBMCs was
lower following TSST exposure, but only in participants with an
urban upbringing in the absence of animals, both in the presence
of LPS [factor time by treatment: F(1,37) = 7.922, P = 0.008; P =
0.035; Fig. 2D] and Con A [factor time: F(1,38) = 12.399, P =
0.001; factor time by treatment: F(1,38) = 4.518, P = 0.040; P <
0.001; Fig. 2E].

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 Effects of Upbringing and/or TSST Exposure on Hypothalamic–
Pituitary–Adrenal Axis, Sympathetic Nervous System, and Cardiovascular
System. Rural vs. urban upbringing, in the presence or absence of
animals, respectively, was associated with higher absolute plasma
cortisol concentrations both at basal (−5 min; P = 0.039) and at
the 5-min (P = 0.030) time point [factor upbringing: F(1,33) =
5.246, P = 0.029; Fig. S2A]. Compared with basal values, plasma
cortisol concentrations were increased in both groups (both P <
0.001) at 5 min [factor time: F(5,165) = 26.978, P < 0.001; Fig.
S2A], with a comparable delta increase (5 min – basal) (Fig. S2A
inlay). Basal (−5 min) salivary α-amylase concentrations were
not different between groups. Salivary α-amylase [factor time:
F(5,180) = 25.723, P < 0.001; Fig. S2B] was increased in both
groups at 5 min (urban, P < 0.001; rural, P < 0.001) and/or
15 min (rural, P = 0.001) compared with respective basal values.
Basal mean arterial blood pressure was not different between
groups. Mean arterial blood pressure [factor time: F(5,185) =
59.241, P < 0.001; Fig. S2C] was increased in both groups at
5 min (urban, P < 0.001; rural, P < 0.001) and 15 min (urban, P =
0.001; rural, P < 0.001) compared with respective basal values
and a main effect of time was found for heart rate [F(5,185) =
14.810, P < 0.001; Fig. S2D].
Discussion
Here, we showed an increased systemic immune activation in
response to a standardized laboratory social stressor in healthy
participants with an urban upbringing in the absence of pets,
relative to healthy participants with a rural upbringing in the
presence of farm animals, even though questionnaires, plasma
cortisol, and salivary α-amylase indicated that the experimental
protocol was more stressful and anxiogenic for the latter. These
data are in line with the biodiversity, missing-microbes, and old-
friends hypotheses, which propose that the rapid rise in in-
flammatory physical and mental diseases in modern societies is
due in part to a lack of exposure to immunoregulatory micro-
organisms (16–18). Another possible explanation for the in-
creased immune reactivity following TSST in participants with an
urban upbringing in the absence of animals, relative to partici-
pants with a rural upbringing in the presence of animals, might
be that natural landscapes provide a stronger positive health
effect compared with urban landscapes, resulting in accelerated
short-term recovery from stress or mental fatigue, faster physical
recovery from illness, and long-term overall improvement on
people’s health and well-being (27). A brief nature experience, a
90-min walk in a natural, but not urban, setting, further de-
creases both self-reported rumination and neural activity in the
subgenual prefrontal cortex (28), a brain region previously shown
to respond with decreased activity to Montreal Imaging Stress
Task exposure in rural vs. urban participants (5).
Acute psychosocial stress was induced using the TSST (25),
well known for its ability to elevate PBMC counts (29) and
plasma concentrations of IL-6 (8). Consistent with these earlier
studies, TSST exposure in the current study increased the
number of viable PBMCs in both experimental groups, 5 min
following stressor termination, compared with respective basal
values (at −5 min). However, while PBMC counts in rural par-
ticipants raised in the presence of animals were increased only at
5 min, PBMC counts in urban participants raised in the absence
of animals were increased at 5, 60, 90, and 120 min following
TSST, indicating a more pronounced immune activation in ur-
ban vs. rural participants raised in the absence or presence of
animals, respectively, in response to a social stressor. This is
further supported by the fact that PBMC counts of urban par-
ticipants raised in the absence of animals were elevated com-
pared with rural participants raised in the presence of animals at
the 5-, 60-, and 120-min time points following TSST exposure.
Although we did not perform differential blood counts in the
current study, increased lymphocyte and unaffected monocyte
counts following TSST have been reported in previous studies
(30, 31), suggesting that the exaggerated PBMC mobilization in
urban vs. rural participants raised in the absence or presence of
animals, respectively, in the present study is mainly mediated by
the lymphocyte compartment. Again, consistent with well-known
TSST effects (32–34), plasma IL-6 concentrations were in-
creased in both groups 60 and 90 min following TSST compared
with respective basal values. Importantly and consistent with the
exaggerated stress-induced PBMC mobilization, this increase
was again more pronounced in urban vs. rural participants raised
in the absence or presence of animals, respectively. While plasma
IL-6 concentrations in rural participants raised in the presence of
animals peaked at 90 min and were not different from baseline at
120 min, levels in urban participants raised in the absence of
animals were elevated until at least 120 min, indicating a pro-
longed inflammatory response following TSST exposure. Changes
to plasma IL-6 after 120 min or before 60 min were not expected
(32) and, thus, not studied here, but our results suggest that in-
creased IL-6 might persist beyond the 120-min time point in urban
participants raised in the absence of animals. As plasma IL-6 at
baseline, 60 min, and 90 min did not differ between the groups,
basal and acute stress-induced immune activation seem to be
unaffected by upbringing, whereas immunoregulatory capacity
responsible for adequate resolution of stress-induced immune
activation seems to be compromised in urban participants raised
in the absence of animals.
Basal ex vivo IL-6 secretion between PBMCs from both groups
was comparable and TSST independent, suggesting that up-
bringing effects on plasma IL-6 concentrations were due to
changes in circulating PBMC numbers rather than to individual
cell activity. In contrast, ex vivo IL-6 secretion during Con A, but
not LPS, stimulation was significantly increased in urban vs. rural
participants raised in the absence or presence of animals, re-
spectively, at baseline conditions and 120 min following TSST.
The latter suggests increased cellular reactivity of the adaptive
(Con A), but not the innate (LPS), immune system toward im-
munologic stimuli in urban participants raised in the absence of
animals, which is in line with the fact that, based on previous
studies (30, 31), mainly lymphocytes are mobilized by TSST.
Although TSST exposure in the present study did not sensitize
proinflammatory ex vivo cytokine secretion as described earlier
(29), increased ex vivo cytokine secretion toward immunologic
stimuli has been reported for individuals with a diagnosis of
depression (35) or posttraumatic stress disorder (9). Of note, as
these studies employed immunologic stimuli specific for either
T cells and, thus, adaptive immunity (i.e., phytohemagglutinin)
(35), or for monocytes and, thus, innate immunity (i.e., LPS) (9,
36), it remains to be investigated whether different psychiatric
disorders, like anxiety disorders, mood disorders, as well as
trauma- and stressor-related disorders, go along with, or are
promoted by, activation of either the innate or adaptive immune
system. Data from studies on healthy school teachers indicate
that not only lymphocytes but also monocytes of individuals that
experience high levels of effort–reward imbalance are more
likely to show a pronounced inflammatory response to a mitogen
signal (36).

10 secretion was inhibited by TSST only in this group, both in the
presence of LPS (Fig. 2D) and Con A (Fig. 2E). As the stress-
protective and immunoregulatory effects of repeated immuni-
zation with Mycobacterium vaccae, a soil-derived, saprophytic
bacterium with immunoregulatory and antiinflammatory activity,
are mediated by the induction of Treg and IL-10 secretion (37),
and as IL-10–deficient mice are prone to develop inflammatory
disorders (38), these findings are in accordance with the in-
creased risk for both inflammatory somatic and mental disorders

 in urban vs. rural participants (2, 3). Importantly, increased in-
flammatory TSST responses also have been reported in other
young healthy individuals at risk for mental disorders, with re-
sponse magnitudes predicting disease incidence (33, 39, 40).
In contrast to the immunologic results reported above and in
contrast to findings reported by Steinheuser et al. (6), the TSST
reactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis,
sympathetic nervous system, and cardiovascular system were
comparable, or significantly more pronounced, in rural vs. urban
participants raised in the presence or absence of animals, re-
spectively. In detail, compared with respective baseline values,
plasma cortisol concentrations were increased in both groups
5 min following TSST, with the delta increase being comparable
as well. In line with these findings, salivary α-amylase, a surrogate
marker for sympathetic nervous system activity (26), and medial
arterial pressure were increased in both groups at 5 and/or
15 min, compared with respective basal values, and a main effect
of time was found for heart rate. Interestingly, rural vs. urban
upbringing in the presence or absence of animals, respectively,
was associated with higher plasma cortisol concentrations, both
at baseline and 5 min after the TSST; likewise, rural vs. urban
upbringing in the presence or absence of animals, respectively,
was associated with a delayed normalization of salivary α-amy-
lase, suggesting that the experimental setup and procedure were
more stressful and aversive for the former group. This hypothesis
is supported by increased anxiety levels in the STAI-S, both at
−60 and 90 min, and in the HADS-D, as well as with increased
scores in threat, challenge, primary appraisal, and stress index in
the PASA reported by rural vs. urban participants raised in the
presence or absence of animals, respectively. Given that gluco-
corticoids during acute stress have been shown to facilitate im-
mune activation (41–43), it is unlikely that the transiently
elevated basal cortisol concentrations in rural vs. urban partici-
pants raised in the presence or absence of animals, respectively,
are involved in mediating the decreased TSST-induced immune
activation in the former group. This is further in line with data
showing that stress-induced mobilization of bone marrow mye-
loid cells is mediated by β3-adrenergic signaling (44) and data
suggesting that TSST-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) acti-
vation in PBMCs is likely mediated by adrenoreceptor-mediated
signaling (45). However, TSST-induced NF-κB activation in
PBMCs was also shown to negatively correlate with plasma
cortisol response (46). However, as the significant main effect for
factor upbringing on plasma cortisol levels did not hold when
controlling for BMI, education, income, and current daily con-
tact with pets and/or farm animals, the effects of upbringing
on plasma cortisol levels were dependent on one or more of
these covariates.
Thus, although an increased HPA axis (re)activity has been
associated with several psychiatric disorders (47), our data do not
support, or even are contrasting to, the hypothesis that the in-
creased prevalence of mental disorders reported in urban vs.
rural areas (2, 3) is due to an exaggerated HPA axis (re)activity.
Furthermore, we did not detect any differences in early life
(CECA-Q; CTQ) or perceived life stress (PSS-4) between
groups, making it also unlikely that “a more demanding and
stressful social urban environment” (5) contributes to or even
mediates the increased disease prevalence in the urban vs. rural
population in other studies (2, 3). Of note, SCID-I and BL
scores, assessed during telephone screening (SCID-I), at
−60 min before TSST (BL), or at 120 min after TSST (SCID-I),
indicated that mental and physical health status were not af-
fected by upbringing.
Interestingly, highly industrialized farming with low contact
with farm animals, relative to traditional farming with regular
contact with farm animals, is paralleled by increased innate im-
mune system activation and higher prevalences of asthma and
allergic sensitization, conditions that are characterized by
dysregulation of both innate and acquired immune function (21).
Thus, it is likely that the protective effect of rural vs. urban up-
bringing in the presence or absence of animals, respectively, on
TSST-induced immune activation seen in the present study is
rather due to differences in regular animal contact during early
life than to the degree of urbanization per se between the groups.
The latter interpretation would be in line with data indicating
that incidence rates of certain cancer types as well as cardio-
vascular disorders in the United States, both representing ill-
nesses associated with inflammation, are higher or at least
decreasing more slowly in rural compared with urban environ-
ments (48, 49). The trend toward more and more industrialized
farming and mechanization of farm work in the last decades (50,
51) and, consequently, the lack of regular and intense animal
contact, might explain why many earlier studies showed lower
incidence rates of these disorders in rural vs. urban areas before
2007 (49).
Our study has several strengths but also some limitations that
warrant consideration. Notable strengths are the use of an ob-
jective and highly standardized stress test, the combination of
both in vivo and ex vivo techniques to assess immune (re)activity,
and repeated in vivo measures of physiologic and immunologic
parameters in the same individuals over a period of 120 min,
taking into account the temporal dynamics of the stress response.
Another strength is that all significant main and interaction ef-
fects reported in the current manuscript, except the main effect
for factor upbringing reported for plasma cortisol levels, were
still detectable after adding BMI, high income, high education,
and current daily contact with pets and/or farm animals as cova-
riates (using a linear mixed model approach). This strongly ar-
gues for the robustness of our findings and for the critical role of
an urban vs. rural upbringing in the absence of presence of an-
imals, respectively, on these parameters. One limitation is the
cross-sectional design of our study and the relatively small
sample size, which, nevertheless, is representative of the sample
sizes in the few previous studies available assessing plasma cy-
tokine levels following TSST exposure (8, 36). Given that women
are more likely to develop mood disorders compared with men
(52), another limitation of the study is that only male participants
were used. As Stein et al. (21) particularly emphasize the role of
regular animal contact in promoting immunoregulation in
farmers, yet another limitation of our study is that we did not
include participants raised in urban areas in the presence of
animals and in rural areas in the absence of animals. Additional
limitations are that we did not take into account possible dif-
ferences in participants’ mode of delivery at birth, antibiotic
usage during first years of life, feeding of formula milk as a re-
placement for breast milk, or diet. All these factors are well
known to affect the microbiome and microbiome–gut–brain axis,
and consequently immune (re)activity, stress responsiveness, and
behavior (14, 53, 54). Given the pronounced differences in
TSST-induced PBMC mobilization between urban and rural
participants raised in the absence or presence of animals, re-
spectively, another limitation of the current study is that we do
not have cell compositional data that would allow us to draw
conclusions on the particular cell type(s) mediating this effect.
Despite these limitations, we believe that our experimental
approach contributes significantly to our understanding of pos-
sible biological mechanisms underlying increased risk for in-
flammatory diseases, as well as increased vulnerability to mental
health disorders where inappropriate inflammation is thought to
be a risk factor, for those raised in areas offering a narrow range
of microbial exposures. Our findings reveal an increased systemic
immune activation and a compromised resolution of in-
flammation in urban vs. rural participants, raised in the absence
and presence of animals, respectively, when exposed to an acute
social stressor, likely mediated by differences in early animal
contact, although validated questionnaires and plasma cortisol

 data clearly argue for rural participants raised in the presence of
