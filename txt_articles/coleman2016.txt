ABSTRACT 
Background: Little data exists regarding the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban or apixaban versus 
warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients treated outside of clinical trials.  
Methods: This was a retrospective study using MarketScan claims from 1/2012-10/2014. We included 
adults, newly-initiated on rivaroxaban, apixaban or warfarin, with a baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score≥2, ≥2 
diagnosis codes for NVAF and ≥180-days of continuous medical and prescription benefits. Patients with 
a prior stroke, systemic embolism or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) were excluded. Eligible rivaroxaban 
or apixaban users were 1:1 propensity-score matched individually to warfarin users.  Cox regression was 
performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for rivaroxaban and 
apixaban versus warfarin for the combined endpoint of ischemic stroke or ICH and each endpoint 
individually. 
Results: Upon matching 11,411 rivaroxaban to 11,411 warfarin users, rivaroxaban was associated with a 
significant reduction of the combined endpoint of ischemic stroke or ICH versus warfarin (HR=0.61, 
95%CI=0.45-0.82).  ICH was significantly (HR=0.53, 95%CI=0.35-0.79) and ischemic stroke 
nonsignificantly reduced (HR=0.71, 95%CI=0.47-1.07) by rivaroxaban versus warfarin.  After matching 
4,083 apixaban and 4,083 warfarin users, apixaban was found to nonsignificantly reduce the combined 
endpoint of ischemic stroke or ICH versus warfarin (HR=0.63, 95%CI=0.25-1.12) and to reduce ICH risk 
(HR=0.38, 95%CI=0.17-0.88). Ischemic stroke risk was nonsignificantly increased with apixaban 
(HR=1.13, 95%CI=0.49-2.63) versus warfarin. 
Limitations: Sample size and number of combined events observed were relatively small.  Residual 
confounding could not be ruled out.  
Conclusions: Rivaroxaban and apixaban were associated with less ICH than warfarin and both are likely 
associated with reductions in the combined endpoint.  Further investigation to validate the numerically 
higher rate of ischemic stroke with apixaban versus warfarin is required.

INTRODUCTION 
Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia affecting up to 6.1 million persons 
in the United States (US), and is associated with a ~5-fold increased risk of stroke [1].  Current NVAF 
guidelines recommend initiation of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy based on validated stroke risk 
scores [1].  
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [2-4] have demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety profiles for 
the oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) compared to warfarin.  Most notably, 
these direct-acting OACs have been shown to significantly reduce patients’ risk for intracranial 
hemorrhage (ICH) by 33-58%.   
In routine clinical practice, OACs may be used differently than in their respective pivotal, phase III RCTs.  
When rigorously performed, real-world evidence studies (including administrative claims database 
analyses) can offer valuable insight into the effectiveness and safety of OAC used outside of a well-
controlled clinical trial setting. The objective of the Real-world EVIdence on Stroke prevention In 
patients with aTrial fibrillation in the United States (REVISIT-US) study was to affirm the effectiveness 
and safety of previously OAC treatment naïve, newly-initiated factor Xa inhibition with rivaroxaban or 
apixaban compared with warfarin in NVAF patients using data from a large, US administrative claims 
database. 
PATIENTS AND METHODS 
This manuscript was written in compliance with the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational 
studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement [5]. 
REVISIT-US was a retrospective administrative claims database study using US Truven MarketScan 
data spanning January 2012 through October 2014.  MarketScan combines two separate databases, a 
JUST ACCEPTED
  
commercial and the Medicare supplemental database, to cover all age groups and contains claims from 
~100 employers, health plans and government and public organizations representing about 170 million 
covered lives in the US [6]. MarketScan captures health plan enrollment records, limited participant 
demographics, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth-Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-
CM) diagnosis and procedure codes, admission and discharge dates, inpatient mortality data and 
outpatient medical services and prescription drug dispensing records.  All data included in the 
MarketScan database are de-identified and are in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 to preserve participant anonymity and confidentiality.  For this reason, this 
study was exempt from institutional review board oversight. 
To be included in REVISIT-US, patients had to be OAC treatment naïve in the 180-days prior to the day 
of the first qualifying OAC dispensing, newly-initiated on rivaroxaban, apixaban, or warfarin, ≥18 years-
of-age on the day of the first qualifying OAC dispensing (index date), with a baseline CHA2DS2-VASc 
score≥2 [1], ≥2 ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for NVAF (427.31) and ≥180 days of continuous medical and 
prescription coverage prior to initiation of OAC. Patients with valvular heart disease, a transient cause 
of NVAF, venous thromboembolism, hip or knee replacement surgery, malignant cancer or pregnancy, 
and patients receiving OAC before the index date, or prescribed >1 OAC agent on the index date or 
during follow-up were excluded. In addition, we excluded patients with a prior history of stroke, 
systemic embolism or ICH from the analysis to prevent misclassification of past events as new events.    
Each eligible rivaroxaban user was 1:1 propensity-score matched (using greedy nearest neighbor 
matching and a caliper of 1%) to a warfarin user to minimize the presence of baseline differences 
between cohorts [7]. Similarly, each eligible apixaban user was 1:1 propensity-score matched to a 
warfarin user.  As a result of the above described matching process, this study reports on 2 unique 
analyses (rivaroxaban versus warfarin and apixaban versus warfarin) with different sample sizes.  We 
JUST ACCEPTED
  
included rivaroxaban and apixaban patients starting at each agent’s individual US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval date (11/2011 for rivaroxaban and 12/2012 for apixaban) [8] and only 
matched these patients to warfarin users initiating OAC during the same time frame.  Residual 
differences in characteristics between matched cohorts were assessed by calculating the standardized 
differences, with differences <10% between cohorts considered balanced [9].  Patients were matched 
using age, gender, region, health plan type, CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, ATRIA, modified HAS-BLED 
(excluding the liable international normalized ratio criteria) and Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index 
scores [1, 10-12], presence of comorbid heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, unstable angina 
or renal failure, use of anti-arrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-platelet agents or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs and number of hospital days and office visits during the 180-day index period.   
The primary endpoint evaluated in REVISIT-US was the combination of ischemic stroke or ICH 
(reflecting the most important efficacy and safety endpoints with comparable severity in OAC trials).  
Each component of this endpoint was also evaluated separately.  Occurrence of these endpoints during 
the observation period was determined by the presence of an ICD-9-CM code as recommended by US 
FDA “Mini-Sentinel” post-marketing surveillance system [13] coding schemas. Patients were followed 
until the occurrence of an ischemic stroke or ICH, discontinuation or switching to an alternative OAC, 
disenrollment from the insurance plan or end of study follow-up. 
Baseline characteristics of patients were analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Incidence rates of 
endpoints were reported as the number of events per 100 person-years (or %/year). Cox proportional 
hazard regression analysis was performed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for developing each endpoint. Analyses were performed in Aetion Evidence Generation 
Platform -- Effectiveness Evaluation Application version R2.0.20160113_2214-0-g6871884 (Aetion Inc., 
JUST ACCEPTED
  
New York, NY, USA). Statistical testing was done in Aetion using R version 3.1.2 (The R Project for 
Statistical Computing, www.r-project.org) [14].  In all cases, a P-value <0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. 
RESULTS 
In total, 38,831 NVAF patients newly-initiated on rivaroxaban or warfarin meeting inclusion criteria 
were identified (Figure 1).  Of these, 10.5% of rivaroxaban patients and could not be adequately 
matched and were therefore excluded from the analyses.  Following propensity-scoring, 11,411 
rivaroxaban (17.3% received the reduced 15 mg once daily) and 11,411 warfarin users were matched. 
Characteristics and person-years of follow-up of these rivaroxaban and warfarin cohorts are available in 
Table 1.  The two cohorts were well-matched, with no characteristic exhibiting a standardized 
difference >10%. Seventy-three rivaroxaban and 103 warfarin users developed the combined endpoint, 
translating into a significant 39% (95%CI=18-55%) lower hazard of developing ischemic stroke or ICH 
among rivaroxaban users (Figure 2). When analyzed separately, both the hazard of ICH and ischemic 
stroke were reduced with rivaroxaban use (47% and 29% lower) compared to warfarin, although 
reduction of the ischemic stroke endpoint did not reach statistical significance (42 versus 52 ischemic 
strokes and 38 versus 60 ICHs in rivaroxaban and warfarin users, respectively).   
We identified 18,591 apixaban (15.5% received the reduced dose) or warfarin patients meeting inclusion 
criteria. Of these, 5.7% of apixaban patients could not be adequately matched and were therefore 
excluded from the analyses.   Upon propensity-scoring and matching, well-matched (no standardized 
differences >10%) cohorts consisting of 4,083 apixaban and 4,083 warfarin users were included (Table 
2).  Nineteen apixaban and 28 warfarin users experienced the combined endpoint of ischemic stroke or 
ICH (hazard reduction with apixaban=37%, P=NS) (Figure 3). This finding was driven by a significant 
JUST ACCEPTED
  
62% reduction in ICH with apixaban (8 versus 19 events) and a 13% non-statistically significant increase 
in ischemic stroke hazard with apixaban (12 versus 10 events) compared to warfarin. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
This administrative claims database study affirmed both rivaroxaban and apixaban use were associated 
with significant (47-62%) reductions in NVAF patients’ hazard of developing ICH as compared to 
warfarin in routine clinical practice.  In the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition 
Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation 
(ROCKET-AF) trial [2], rivaroxaban was found to reduce the risk of ICH by 33% and in the Apixaban for 
Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial [3], 
apixaban reduced ICH by 58% versus warfarin (P<.05 for both).  We believe our findings regarding ICH 
reduction should be reassuring to clinicians as they are generally consistent with those of the above-
mentioned pivotal phase III trials.  Of note, the reductions in ICH seen in REVISIT-US were the 
predominant drivers of the reductions in the combined endpoint observed with both rivaroxaban and 
apixaban versus warfarin (albeit only the rivaroxaban analysis reached statistical significance). 
We found rivaroxaban to be associated with a nonsignificant reduced hazard of ischemic stroke versus 
warfarin in the present study.  Apixaban was associated with a nonsignificant 13% increased hazard of 
ischemic stroke.  The reduction in ischemic stroke with rivaroxaban is generally consistent with 
ROCKET AF (HR=0.94, 95%CI=0.75-1.17) [2].  The 13% increased hazard of ischemic stroke observed in 
apixaban users compared to warfarin users is less consistent with ARISTOTLE (HR=0.92, 95%CI=0.74-
1.13) [3].  This finding of a numerically higher ischemic stroke risk with apixaban in routine practice is 
supported by prior studies [15-16].  In an independent analysis,  Noseworthy and colleagues [15] found 
apixaban to be associated with a 27% (1.04 versus 0.73 events per 100 person-years, P=.39) increased 
hazard of ischemic stroke compared to rivaroxaban in an Optum Labs Data Warehouse claims study 
JUST ACCEPTED
  
utilizing data from October 2010 to February 2015 (median age=73 years; CHA2DS2-VASc score=4 in 
both matched cohorts).  Thus, one potential explanation for the numerical increase in ischemic stroke 
for apixaban versus warfarin seen in our analysis could be the more frequent use of the reduced 2.5 mg 
twice daily dose in routine clinical practice (15.5% received the reduced apixaban dose in REVISIT-US 
versus 4.6% in ARISTOTLE) [3]. For rivaroxaban the use of the reduced dose was more consistent with 
ROCKET AF (17.3% received the reduced 15 mg once daily rivaroxaban dose in REVISIT-US versus 
20.7% in ROCKET AF) [2, 17].   
In addition, poor adherence to the twice daily dosing regimen of apixaban outside of controlled trials 
may also have contributed to our findings [18-22].  Studies suggest suboptimal adherence (taking <80% 
of one’s doses) among NVAF patients may be associated with a 50% increased risk of ischemic stroke 
(95%CI=23-83%) [18]. Moreover, Shore and colleagues [22] found that every 10% reduction in 
dabigatran adherence was associated with a 13% (95%CI=8-19%) increased hazard of all-cause 
mortality or stroke.  Available data from real-world evidence suggests that the use of apixaban in 
routine practice may be associated with more ischemic stroke versus warfarin, and this finding merits 
further investigation. 
REVISIT-US was specifically designed to the extent possible within a claims database to optimize 
internal study rigor, and therefore, obtain the most unbiased HR estimates for rivaroxaban and 
apixaban compared to warfarin. In order to achieve our goal, we selected endpoints that were most 
likely to be accurately identified through ICD-9-CM coding in MarketScan and that were associated 
with similar degrees of morbidity and mortality to assist readers in drawing benefit-risk conclusions.  
Moreover, we used validated ICD-9-CM coding schemas [14] and excluded patients with prior stroke, 
systemic embolism or ICH (which may have contributed to the low number of events) [23].   Each of 
these methodological steps were taken to attenuate the risk of potential misclassification bias common 
JUST ACCEPTED
  
to claims database analyses.  Finally, because rivaroxaban and apixaban were approved at different 
times, and clinician experience and comfort with prescribing these agents likely grows over time 
potentially changing benefit and risk assessment; rivaroxaban and apixaban users were included 
starting at their respective US FDA approval dates and only matched to warfarin users initiating 
anticoagulation during the same time frame. 
We feel it is also important for readers to be cognisant that two separate analyses (rivaroxaban versus 
warfarin and apixaban versus warfarin) were performed and presented in this paper.  As these were 
statistically independent analyses, we discourage cross comparison between the rivaroxaban and 
apixaban cohorts or between the two corresponding warfarin cohorts as this may not yield robust 
conclusions. The primary objective of our analyses was to show consistency between real-world claims 
database analysis and phase III RCTs; and not to draw comparisons between OACs that have not been 
rigorously compared in head-to-head RCTs.  Direct comparison of rivaroxaban and apixaban in 
MarketScan is hampered by the database’s insufficient reporting of laboratory (serum creatinine) and 
clinical data (body weight) which are required to determine if rivaroxaban and apixaban prescribing was 
consistent with labelling. 
This study has additional limitations worthy of discussion.  First, , while propensity-score matching 
generated cohorts that were comparable in key characteristics, only those variables measured in 
MarketScan could be matched upon and residual confounding cannot be excluded.  Second, 
MarketScan has a substantial lag in time to data availability.  As a result, upon securing these data and 
performing analysis in early 2016, MarketScan data was only available through October 2014.  This 
meant there were only about 4,000 eligible apixaban users in this dataset.   Given RCTs of rivaroxaban 
[2] and apixaban [3] have enrolled >7,000 subject per study arm, it is likely the apixaban analyses were 
somewhat underpowered and any apixaban versus rivaroxaban comparison would be more so.  With 
JUST ACCEPTED
  
this in mind, it is important to remember that failure to show a significant difference between agents, in 
studies such as the one presented, is not proof of equivalence or noninferiority.  Finally, it was not 
possible to determine the duration of time warfarin users spent in the therapeutic international 
normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0-3.0. Additional analyses evaluating the effectiveness and safety of 
the direct-acting OACs should be performed once sample sizes in claims databases grow larger.  
CONCLUSION 
In this real-world analysis of NVAF patients within the United States, both rivaroxaban and apixaban 
use was associated with less ICH versus warfarin.  These data confirm results of these agents’ 
corresponding Phase III clinical trials.  Both rivaroxaban and apixaban appear likely associated with 
reductions in the combined endpoint of ICH or ischemic stroke versus warfarin as well.  While only a 
preliminary finding based upon a relatively small number of events, further investigation into the 
numerically (but not statistically) higher rate of ischemic stroke with apixaban versus warfarin is 
required.
