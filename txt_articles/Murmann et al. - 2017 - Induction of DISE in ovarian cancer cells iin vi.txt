ABSTRACT
The death receptor CD95/Fas can be activated by immune cells to kill cancer 
cells. shRNAs and siRNAs derived from CD95 or CD95 ligand (CD95L) are highly toxic 
to most cancer cells. We recently found that these sh/siRNAs kill cancer cells in 
the absence of the target by targeting the 3’UTRs of critical survival genes through 
canonical RNAi. We have named this unique form of off-target effect DISE (for death 
induced by survival gene elimination). DISE preferentially kills transformed cells and 
cancer stem cells. We demonstrate that DISE induction occurs in cancer cells in vivo 
after introducing a lentiviral CD95L derived shRNA (shL3) into HeyA8 ovarian cancer 
cells grown as i.p. xenografts in mice, when compared to a scrambled shRNA. To 
demonstrate the possibility of therapeutically inducing DISE, we coupled siRNAs to 
templated lipoprotein nanoparticles (TLP). In vitro, TLPs loaded with a CD95L derived 
siRNA (siL3) selectively silenced a biosensor comprised of Venus and CD95L ORF and 
killed ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, two siRNA-TLPs (siL2-TLP and siL3-TLP) reduced 
tumor growth similarly as observed for cells expressing the shL3 vector. These data 
suggest that it is possible to kill ovarian cancer cells in vivo via DISE induction using 
siRNA-TLPs.
INTRODUCTION
CD95/Fas is a death receptor that together with 
its ligand CD95L regulates immune homeostasis [1, 2]. 
Immune cells such as cytotoxic killer and natural killer 
(NK) cells use CD95L to kill virus infected and cancer 
cells [3]. However, we, and others, reported that CD95 and 
CD95L have multiple tumor promoting activities [4-6] and 
tissue specific deletion of CD95 in the liver or the ovaries 
of mice strongly reduced or prevented tumor formation in 
these tissues [7, 8]. We found that > 80% of 22 different 
siRNAs, DsiRNAs or shRNAs targeting either CD95 or 
CD95L killed cancer cells [8, 9] through a process we 
had coined DICE (for death induced by CD95/CD95L 
elimination). DICE is independent of caspase-8, RIPK1, 
MLKL, and p53, is not inhibited by Bcl-xL expression, and 
it preferentially affects cancer cells [8]. It is characterized 
by an increase in cell size and production of mitochondrial 
ROS, which is followed by DNA damage. It resembles a 
necrotic form of mitotic catastrophe. No single drug was 
found to completely block this form of cell death, and 
DICE could also not be blocked by the knockdown of 
any single gene, making it a promising new way to kill 
cancer cells [8]. More recently, we reported that DICE 
preferentially affects cancer stem cells [10] suggesting 
a physiological role of DICE in targeting neoplastically

transformed cells. 
Surprisingly, we recently discovered that DICE 
works even in the complete absence of CD95 and CD95L 
[9]. DICE is, therefore, a highly selective form of an RNAi 
off-target effect (OTE). We found that CD95 and CD95L 
mRNAs contain dozens of sequences that target a network 
of genes found to be critical for the survival of cancer 
cells and that are often upregulated in cancer [9]. These 
sequences, when introduced into cancer cells in the form 
of transfected siRNAs or lentiviral shRNAs, act through 
canonical RNAi, targeting the survival genes through short 
seed matches in their 3’UTRs. The cancer cells likely 
die due to the loss of multiple survival genes. We have 
therefore called this form of cell death DISE (for death 
induced by survival gene elimination) [9]. The complex 
nature of this toxicity may explain why cancer cells have 
difficulties developing resistance to DISE. 
We have now explored how inducing DISE may 
be a novel form of cancer therapy. We first demonstrated 
that DISE induction works in an in vivo model in which 
mice xenografted with ovarian cancer cells expressed a 
CD95L derived shRNA (shL3). We then delivered two 
siRNAs derived from CD95L (siL2 and siL3) to mice with 
ovarian cancer xenografts using a nanoparticle platform 
demonstrated previously to deliver siRNA in vivo [11, 12]. 
Templated lipoprotein particles (TLP) stabilize siRNA 
and are dependent upon SR-B1 expression for efficient 
siRNA delivery. The TLPs were delivered i.p., taken up 
by the tumor cells, and acted through canonical RNAi, 
substantially reducing tumor growth. 
The in vivo study was terminated once the control 
treated mice showed signs of discomfort due to large 
tumors and/or ascites formation. The remaining tumor 
cells from the nanoparticle delivered siL3 group were 
resected, cultured, and transfected with siL3 in culture 
using a commercially available cationic lipid-based 
transfection reagent in order to determine if the cells 
became insensitive to DISE. In this context, the tumor 
cells were still fully susceptible to DISE, suggesting that 
treatment optimization (i.e. dose and time) may allow 
for full eradication of tumor growth. Collectively, these 
data demonstrate that DISE induction is a promising new 
approach for treating cancer. 
RESULTS
Induction of DISE using shRNAs in vivo
In multiple cancer cells tested in vitro, including 
ovarian cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1A), 
DISE induction is a potent mechanism for cancer cell 
treatment [8]. To test whether DISE is a viable mechanism 
for in vivo treatment, we chose an orthotopic mouse 
model of ovarian cancer. We selected the highly active 
shRNA shL3, which we have previously demonstrated 
kills cancer cells by targeting survival genes [9]. In 
vitro, cells were selected with puromycin after lentiviral 
infection. However, because puromycin selection could 
not be used in vivo, prior to in vivo experiments we 
tested the efficiency of shRNA virus infection and DISE 
induction in HeyA8 Venus-siL3-pFUL2T cells with and 
without puromycin selection (Figure 1A). Cell growth 
was reduced in cells treated using a MOI of 5 (without 
puromycin treatment) and was comparable to cells 
selected by treatment with puromycin (after infection 
with a MOI of 3). The in vitro data demonstrate that DISE 
induction occurs roughly 2-3 days after introducing the 
shRNA [8]. To determine the effects of DISE in vivo, we 
injected NSG mice i.p. with cells infected with either 
pLKO-shScr or pLKO-shL3 virus without puromycin 
treatment (Figure 1B, left panel) or treated for one day 
with puromycin before injection (Figure 1B, center panel). 
Tumor growth was monitored over two weeks and tumor 
cells expressing shL3 grew slower when compared to 
tumors expressing shScr. Upon histological inspection 
of the tumors by a pathologist, 13 days after cancer cell 
injection, shScr control treated tumors showed large areas 
of central necrosis in larger tumors, presumably caused 
by hypoxia (Figure 1C-a, b, top panel), and demonstrated 
signs of tumor cells invading the omentum with no signs 
of necrosis (Figure 1C-c, top panel). The shL3 expressing 
tumors showed signs of necrosis in smaller tumors than 
seen in the shScr expressing tumor cells (Figure 1C-d). 
Clear signs of tumor regression were seen with small areas 
of residual tumors. Our data demonstrate that cancer cells, 
when grown in vivo, are susceptible to DISE, confirming 
that DISE induction may be a potent therapy for cancer. 
To induce shRNA expression after injection of 
tumor cells, we used the Tet inducible pTIP vector [8]. 
HeyA8-pFUL2G cells were stably infected with either 
pTIP-shScr or pTIP-shL3 in the presence and absence of 
puromycin selection and then treated with Doxycycline 
(Dox) to induce shRNA expression. shL3 expression 
significantly slowed down growth of cells compared to 
shScr (Figure 2A). Puromycin treatment did not have an 
effect on cell growth in the absence of Dox. HeyA8 cells 
treated with Dox to induce shL3 showed little to no growth 
and most cells demonstrated cell death when compared 
to shScr expressing cells (Supplementary Movies 1 and 
2). The pTIP-shScr and pTIP-shL3 cells were injected i.p. 
into NSG mice and one day after tumor injection half the 
mice were given Dox in their drinking water. Small animal 
imaging showed that tumor growth was significantly 
reduced in mice injected with cells expressing pTIP-shL3 
that received Dox (Figure 2B, left panel). The level of 
growth reduction was more pronounced when the tumors 
were excised and weighed (Figure 2B, right panel). 
Because there was remaining pTIP-shL3 tumor at 
the end of the study, we wanted to determine if the cells 
were no longer responsive to shL3 due to a mutation,

had become resistant to DISE, had reduced function of 
the RNAi machinery, or no longer responded to Dox. 
Therefore, we isolated cells from tumors of four mice and 
cultured them in puromycin for 2 days to eliminate any 
host cells. Three resected tumors were from pTIP-shL3 
mice that had received Dox, and the fourth tumor was 
from a mouse carrying a pTIP-shScr expressing tumor. 
All four cultured tumors expressed roughly the same 
amount of GFP documenting that a substantial number 
of cells in each culture were HeyA8 cells with the pTIP 
vector (Supplementary Figure 2). When these cells were 
plated in the presence of Dox all four of them grew in 
vitro (Figure 2C). To determine if mutations present in the 
cell culture were responsible for the apparent resistance 
to toxic activity of shL3, we cultured HeyA8-pTIP-shScr 
and HeyA8-pTIP-shL3 cells in vitro in the presence of 
Dox for an extended period of time. Interestingly, every 
clone plated grew out (Figure 2D and data not shown, 
Supplementary Movie 3, well H5 and Supplementary 
Movie 4, control). However, it was unlikely that rare 
mutations occurred in every well that contributed to the 
clone growth, because only 250 cells were plated per 
well. To determine if cells had become resistant to the 
DISE-inducing activity of shL3 we introduced the shL3 
shRNA in a different form into one of the resistant clones 
(H5) using the pLKO vector in the presence of Dox and 
puromycin (Figure 2E). While the H5 cells were impaired 
in their growth compared to cells isolated from a well 
with cells expressing shScr, they were not resistant to 
DISE induced by either shR6 (a shRNA targeting CD95) 
or shL3 (Figure 2E, right panel). These data suggest that 
RNAi was still fully active in the resistant clone. This was 
also confirmed by the demonstration that shR6 knocked 
down CD95 as efficiently in the H5 clone as in the control 
cells (Figure 2F). Most important however, was the 
observation that the H5 clone which was resistant to Dox 
induction of shL3 driven from the pTIP vector was still 
fully susceptible to the very same shRNA when induced 
using a different vector. The in vitro data suggest that 
tumor cells did not develop resistance to DISE but rather 
to the vector or to Dox used to induce the shRNA. Similar 
data were also obtained in vitro and in vivo when the pTIP-
shL3 vector was used in a breast cancer mouse model in 
which we injected MB-MDA-231 cells expressing pTIP-
shScr or pTIP-shL3 into the fat pad and cultured the cells 
ex vivo (data not shown). This suggests that the resistance 
that developed is not specific to HeyA8 cells but could be 
a more fundamental effect seen with the pTIP vector. 
siL3 kills ovarian cancer cells by targeting a 
network of survival genes
These data suggested that it might be possible 
to induce DISE in vivo by delivering siRNAs to tumor 
cells. We recently showed that the majority of the tested 
shRNAs, siRNAs and DsiRNAs that are derived from 
CD95L induced DISE [9]. We selected two toxic siRNAs, 
siL2 and siL3, derived from CD95L. Both were active in 
silencing their cognate target [8] and in reducing growth of 
HeyA8 cells (Figure 3A). To monitor delivery and RNAi 
activity of siL3 in vivo, we developed a biosensor plasmid 
that carried a CD95L mini gene of 50 nt with the center 
comprised of the 20 nt sequence that is targeted by siL3. 
This minigene was linked to a Venus fluorophore (Figure 
3B). We generated a mutant form of the sensor whereby 
the siL3 target site was mutated in 6 positions. HeyA8 
cells were generated either expressing the siL3WT or 
the siL3MUT sensor. These cells were transfected with a 
nontargeting siRNA (siScr), siL3 or siL3MUT and, after 
2 days, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 
3C). The green fluorescence in the cells carrying the two 
sensor constructs was only reduced upon transfection 
with the siRNA that was completely complementary 
to the sequence in the sensor. This established the 
sensor system as a sensitive tool to detect the activity

shScr treated tumors, tumor mass showed two zones of viable (right) and necrotic (left) tumor regions with sharply demarcated boundary. 
The viable tumor cells were cohesive with dense basophilic and pale cytoplasm. In shL3 treated tumor, a zone of dying tumor cells were 
seen in between viable and necrotic zones. This zone had tumor cells that were loosely cohesive with mixed dying, dead and viable cells. 
b, Close view of tumor cells revealed the different cytologic features. In shScr treated tumors, cells were more cohesive with a solid growth 
pattern with centrally located large and high grade nuclei. In shL3 treated tumors, cells were loosely cohesive with eccentrically located 
nuclei and eosinophilic and hyaline cytoplasm. These findings suggest early degenerative or regressing changes. c, Tumor infiltrating into 
fat had minimal or no tumor cell necrosis. In shScr treated tumors, tumor mass in fat had large and high tumor volume (top panel). In shL3, 
infiltrating tumor cells were much smaller in size and volume and areas of regression change were seen (bottom panel). d, Tumor regression 
could be frequently seen in shL3 treated tumors, characterized by well demarked tumor nodules (left three images) with peripheral rim of 
viable tumor cells (right panel) and central regression of tumor bed which was replaced by histiocytes, lymphocytes and fibrotic stromal 
cells.

of the CD95L targeting siL3. Finally, we monitored the 
change in fluorescence, cell morphology and confluency 
(as a surrogate marker of cell viability) over time upon 
transfection with the different siRNAs (Figure 3D 
and Supplementary Movies 5-8). When HeyA8 cells 
expressing the siL3WT Venus sensor were transfected 
with siL3MUT they remained green and became 
confluent after 6 days (Supplementary Movie 5). The 
same cells transfected with siL3 lost green fluorescence 
after about 2 days and never reached confluency due to 
DISE induction (Supplementary Movie 6). In contrast, 
when HeyA8 cells expressing the siL3MUT sensor were 
transfected with the complementary siL3MUT siRNA they 
lost green fluorescence after 2 days but became confluent 
(Supplementary Movie 7), when transfected with siL3 they 
remained green but did not reach confluency due to DISE 
induction (Supplementary Movie 8). These experiments 
confirmed that siL3 induces DISE in a sequence specific 
manner. 
We recently showed that a number of siRNAs and 
shRNAs derived from either CD95 or CD95L are toxic to 
cancer cells because they target a network of genes that 
are critical for the survival of the cells. We demonstrated 
that siL3 can kill HeyA8 cells even after homozygously 
deleting the siL3 targeted site in HeyA8 cells [9]. To test 
whether the naked siL3 oligonucleotides we planned to 
couple to nanoparticles killed cancer cells by targeting 
survival genes, we transfected HeyA8 cells with no 
detectable expression of CD95L (data not shown) with 
unmodified siScr or siL3 and then performed RNA Seq 
analysis. The most downregulated genes in the siL3 treated 
cells when compared to the cells treated with control siScr 
were enriched in genes recently described in a genome-
wide CRISPR based lethality screen [13] as survival genes 
(Figure 3E) but not enriched in nonsurvival genes. In fact, 
survival genes were about two times more likely targeted 
than nonsurvival genes (Figure 3F). Performing a Sylamer 
analysis which identifies seed matches of si- and miRNAs 
that are enriched in the 3’UTRs of a ranked list of genes, 
confirmed an enrichment of the siL3 seed match in the 
3’UTRs of the downregulated genes (Figure 3G). The data 
in Figure 3E-3G were very similar to the ones obtained 
for cells treated with chemically modified siL3 suggesting 
that the naked siRNA had comparable activities [9]. To 
test whether an independent toxic siRNA, siL2, derived 
from CD95L also induced DISE we generated 293T cells 
lacking the entire CD95L locus using CRISPR/Cas9 gene 
editing (Supplementary Figure 3). Transfection of these 
293T CD95L k.o. cells with either siL3 or siL2 resulted 
in substantial cell growth inhibition (a surrogate marker 
of cell death) (Figure 3H) suggesting that siL2, just like 
siL3, is a toxic siRNA derived from the CD95L gene that 
kills cancer cells by DISE. 
Induction of DISE in cancer cells using TLP 
nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo
We have recently developed a new form of siRNA 
delivery using TLP nanoparticles [11]. We described that 
uptake of the TLPs was dependent on expression of the 
scavenger receptor SR-B1 [11]. To test which of the cancer 
cell lines expressed SR-B1, we subjected a number of 
solid and blood cancer cell lines to Western blot analysis 
(Figure 4A). SR-B1 was expressed in all tested cancer 
cell lines at varying levels. We then tested uptake of TLPs 
coupled with a Cy5 labeled siL3 oligonucleotide (Figure 
4B). Both fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis 
demonstrated efficient uptake of the labeled particles 
in 17 different cancer cell lines. Particles were taken up 
within 1 hour and when excess particles were washed 
away detection of labeled siL3 slowly dissipated (Figure 
4C). Next we tested whether uptake of siL3 loaded TLPs 
resulted in reduction of green fluorescence and induction 
of DISE in HeyA8-Venus-siL3 cells (Figure 4D). The 
siL3-TLP, but not the siL3MUT-TLP (see Figure 3B) or 
empty TLPs, had a strong effect on green fluorescence 
(Figure 4D and 4E, 4F). Incubation of these cells with the 
siL3-TLP also induced DISE (Figure 4D and 4F). This 
was also found for the p53 mutant ovarian cancer cell line 
OVCAR3 and for another epithelial ovarian cancer cell 
line OVCAR4 (Supplementary Figure 1B). 
To test whether siRNA-TLPs could be used to 
induce DISE in vivo, HeyA8-Venus-siL3 cells also 
expressing a Tomato red luciferase construct were injected 
i.p. into NSG mice and a day after injection mice were 
subjected to IVIS analysis. Based on the bioluminescence 
signal they were sorted into three groups (10 mice per 
group) so that each group had a similar signal distribution. 
Mice were injected 5 times over 9 days with water, siScr-
TLP or siL3-TLP (Figure 5A). Tumors of a small group 
of additional mice were analyzed by flow cytometry 10 
days after tumor injection (after 4 injections with TLPs). 
The red/green ratio as a measure of targeting the Venus 
siL3 sensor was determined (Figure 5B). Together with 
a reduction in green fluorescence in the tumors treated 
with siL3-TLP when compared to tumors treated with 
siScr-TLP (Figure 5C) provided evidence that the TLPs 
had entered the tumor tissue and were actively inducing 
RNAi in the case of siL3-TLP. We also noticed an 
increase in the side scatter of red tumor cells taken from 
three tumors from a mouse treated with siL3-TLP when 
compared to cells of three tumors from a mouse treated 
with siScr-TLP (Figure 5D, left panel), a phenomenon 
also observed in vitro in HeyA8 cells after transfection 
with siL3 (Figure 5D, right panel, and data not shown). 
The most likely reason for this observation is an increase 
in granularity of the cells caused by the appearance of 
massive stress granules caused by DISE induction in 
these cells [8]. Finally, data show a significant reduction 
in IVIS signal from the tumor cells at both the second and

third measurement (Figure 5E) when treated with the siL3-
TLP, but not when treated with water or siScr-TLP. The 
data suggest that it is possible to deliver a DISE inducing 
siRNA to tumor cells in vivo.
To test whether a longer treatment and another 
DISE inducing siRNA would promote a more pronounced 
tumor growth reduction, we treated mice (n = 10/group) 
with siScr-TLP, siL3-TLP and siL2-TLP for three weeks 
(Figure 6A). To be able to detect CD95L specific RNAi by 
the two siRNAs we used HeyA8 cells expressing a Venus 
sensor that contained the entire CD95L open reading 
frame [9]. In addition, to be able to distinguish tumor 
from host tissues in the mice we also stably expressed a 
red fluorophore localized to the nucleus in the tumor cells. 
Mice were i.p. injected with 105 cells and treated with 
TLP nanoparticles as indicated (Figure 6A). Both siL2-
TLP and siL3-TLP substantially reduced tumor growth 
(Figure 6B). Mice had to be sacrificed at 23 days due to 
the aggressive growth of HeyA8 cells in siScr-TLP treated 
mice. To determine whether particles were taken up by the 
tumor cells and whether the siRNAs acted through RNAi 
we isolated and froze tumor tissue from three mice in each 
treatment group and determined by immunofluorescence 
microscopy the level of reduction in green fluorescence. 
Overall, reduction in green fluorescence was detectable 
throughout the tumors of mice treated with the siL2-
TLP or siL3-TLP (Figure 6C). While the nanoparticles 
accumulated on the tumors (Supplementary Figure 4A) 
no particles were obvious on the livers or the kidneys of 
the treated mice and no signs of toxicity were detected 
(Supplementary Figure 4B). This was corroborated by 
the analysis of the serum of treated mice. No elevation

in liver enzymes was measured (Supplementary Figure 
4C). Due to the mechanism of DISE induction we found 
cross-reactivity of human derived sh- and siRNAs to 
targeted survival genes in mouse cells (data not shown) 
and transfection of siL3 into mouse ovarian cancer cell 
line ID8 slowed down their growth (Supplementary Figure 
4D). These data suggest that siL3-TLP was not toxic to the 
mice but reduced tumor growth by inducing DISE in the 
tumor cells.
Similar to the experiments in which we expressed 
shRNAs in cancer cells in vivo to reduce tumor growth, 
treatment of the HeyA8 tumors with TLP nanoparticles 
also did not completely eliminate the cancer cells. To 
determine the mechanism of treatment resistance we 
isolated tumor cells from mice that had been treated with 
either siScr-TLP or siL3-TLP particles (three mice each) 
and after establishing tissue culture in vitro we introduced 
the siL3 siRNA into the cells by transfection (Figure 6D). 
In all cases, regardless of whether cells were derived 
from siScr-TLP or siL3-TLP treated mice, when siL3 was 
introduced it efficiently reduced the Venus fluorescence 
to zero (Figure 6D, top panels) and effectively killed the 
cells (Figure 6D, bottom panels). These data demonstrated 
that similar to the Dox treated HeyA8-pTIP-shL3 cells, 
the cells did not become resistant to the induction of 
DISE when they were isolated ex vivo and cultured under 
standard laboratory conditions. In summary, our data 
suggest that it is possible to induce DISE in vivo. Further 
work is needed to understand the mechanism of DISE 
induction, and to optimize strategies aimed at inducing 
DISE in vivo.
DISCUSSION
Most targeted cancer therapy is based on small 
molecule inhibitors or biological reagents that target an 
oncogene often overexpressed in cancer cells. However, 
such targeted therapy has not resulted in a cure for the 
majority of cancer patients with advanced cancer. Most 
often patients develop resistance to the treatment, either 
because tumors in relapsing patients carry mutations in the 
targeted gene or the tumors upregulate factors that render 
them resistant to the therapy [14, 15]. Using more of the 
same therapy is futile and thus attempts are being made to 
find alternative targets for therapy or to re-sensitize cancer 
cells to the targeted therapy. In fact, it has been suggested 
that we will need to find “a radically different therapeutic

modality” [16]. It has also been argued that rather than 
targeting individual genes, one needs to identify and 
disrupt networks of genes [17]. We are now providing 
such an approach, a radically different way of attacking 
cancer, that affects networks of survival genes.
We recently identified toxic RNAi active sequences 
in the genes of CD95 and CD95L [9]. We had reported 
earlier that introducing such sequences in the form of 
siRNAs or shRNAs induces a combination of multiple 
cell death pathways (we now call DISE) that cancer cells 
have a hard time developing resistance to [8]. Our new 
data on treating mice with nanoparticles to deliver two of 
these siRNAs in vivo now suggest that, in theory, it should 
be possible to induce this mechanism selectively in tumor 
cells in vivo. While we did detect resistance to treatment 
both when DISE was initiated in mice by expressing an 
inducible CD95L derived shRNA and when delivering 
CD95L derived siRNAs using nanoparticles, in both 
cases cells retained their intrinsic sensitivity to DISE. 
Tumor cell sensitivity was confirmed ex vivo as seemly 
resistant tumor cells treated both with lentiviral shRNAs 
or with commercially available siRNAs under standard 
culture conditions, both exhibited growth reduction upon 
reintroduction of treatment. Ultimately, further study is 
required to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of DISE. We 
chose ovarian cancer in an attempt to somewhat localize 
the nanoparticles to one tissue site in the animals. Indeed, 
when injected i.p., few nanoparticles could be detected 
on the liver of the animals but most of them were found 
to decorate or localize within the tumors (Supplementary 
Figure 4A and data not shown).
A key question remaining to be addressed is the 
issue of general toxicity, whether normal cells will die 
by DISE. While our siRNAs were derived from human 
CD95L, due to the mechanism through which DISE works 
it is very likely (and we now demonstrate for siL3) that 
the siRNAs will also kill mouse cells. In fact DISE was 
first seen in the mouse cell line CT26 stably expressing 
human CD95L when we overexpressed human CD95L 
derived shL3 [8]. Only later we discovered that shL3 very 
efficiently killed these mouse cells by targeting a network 
of critical survival genes in the mouse cells (data not

shown). Recently, we reported data to suggest that normal 
cells are protected from DISE by the cellular miRNAs [9] 
which are known to be globally downregulated in human 
cancers when compared to their normal tissues [18]. 
However, the question whether DISE affects normal cells 
requires further research.
We showed that DISE preferentially affects cancer 
stem cells (CSCs) [10]. This selective sensitivity suggested 
that the DISE mechanism may have a physiological role in 
protecting stem cells from neoplastic transformation and 
that it can be used to target CSCs. The question arising 
as with every therapy directed at CSCs is whether it will 
affect somatic stem cells. This will have to be tested. 
We propose that DISE will predominantly affect 
cancer cells making it unnecessary to specifically deliver 
the drugs to the cancer cells. In this case, the TLP 
nanoparticles used in our study are dependent on the 
expression of the SR-B1 scavenger receptor, a receptor 
expressed by numerous cancer types. Our data support that 
siRNA-TLP may be used to induce DISE in different types 
of cancer via local or systemic administration. Further, 
other targeted vesicles, such as exosomes, may be loaded 
with DISE-inducing siRNAs whereby systemic delivery 
may be accomplished. Finally, generating exosomes or 
nanoparticles with mixtures of toxic siRNAs derived 
from CD95/CD95L [9], or other genes that contain such 
sequences, may allow more potent targeting of cancer 
cells. While the siRNAs used in our study are toxic to 
cancer cells, recent work from our group suggests that the 
human genome is filled with genes that contain such toxic 
sequences allowing screening for the ones that are most 
toxic to cancer cells and least toxic to normal cells and 
then using aforementioned delivery strategies for in vivo 
therapy. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and tissue culture
Base media were supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and 
1% penicillin/streptomycin and L-Glutamine (Mediatech 
Inc.). Adherent cells were dissociated with 0.25% (w/v) 
Trypsin- 0.53 mM EDTA solution (Mediatech Inc.). Cells 
were cultured in an atmosphere of air, 95% and 5% carbon 
dioxide (CO2) at 37°C. For lentivirus production 293T

lines were used: breast cancer: MCF-7 (NCI60 cell panel), 
MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26) and HCC-70 (ATCC 
CRL-2315) were cultured in supplemented RPMI1640 
Medium (Mediatech Inc.), SKBR-3 (ATCC HTB-30), in 
McCoy’s 5a Medium Modified (ATCC); Ovarian cancer: 
OVCAR-3, OVCAR-4, OVCAR-5, and OVCAR-8 (all 
Tumor Biology Core, Northwestern University) were 
cultured in RPMI1640; Caov-3 (ATCC HTB-75) in 
DMEM. HeyA8, Monty-1, and SKOV3IP1 were obtained 
from Dr. E. Lengyel, University of Chicago. HeyA8 
was cultured in RPMI1640, Monty-1 and SKOV3IP1 
in DMEM that was further supplemented with 1% non-
essential amino Acids 100x (BioWhittaker), 1% Sodium 
Pyruvate 100 mM (BioWhittaker), and 1% MEM Vitamins 
100x solution (Mediatech Inc.). Glioblastoma cell lines 
T98G (ATCC CRL1690) and U-87 MG (ATCC HTB-
14) were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium 
(EMEM) (ATCC). The neuroblastoma cell line NB-7, the 
colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 (ATCC CCL-247), and 
JA3 (a subclone of Jurkat, an acute T-cell leukemia cell 
line, University of Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured in 
RPMI1640. The hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 
(ATCC HB-80645) was cultured in EMEM (ATCC). ID8, 
a mouse ovarian cancer cell line, was cultured in DMEM 
supplemented with 4% FBS, and 10 mg/l Insulin, 5.5 mg/l 
Transferrin, 6.7 μg/ml Selenium (ITS, Mediatech, Inc., 
1:10 diluted). 
Lentiviral infection
50,000 to 100,000 cells per 6-well were plated and 
infected the following day. When the lentivirus titer was 
known, the cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection 
(MOI) of 3 or 5 in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene, 
for 24 hours. Otherwise virus mix was produced by 
transfecting 293T cells. 3-4 million 293T cells were 
plated in a 10 cm dish in antibiotics free medium. 
Next day, in one tube 60 µl of Lipofectamine® 2000 
Transfection Reagent was mixed with 1ml Opti-MEM 
medium (Gibco), and this tube was incubated for 5 min 
at RT. In a second tube, a lentiviral vector, a packaging 
plasmid pCMVDR8.9, and an envelope plasmid pMD.G 
(VSV.G-envelope protein encoding plasmid) were mixed 
at a ratio of 12 μg:6 μg:6 μg in 1 ml Opti-MEM I. The two 
tubes were then mixed and incubated for 20 mins after 
which the transfection mix was added drop wise to the 
10 cm dish of 293T cells. After 9 hours, the transfection 
mix was removed, and replaced with fresh full medium. 
The virus mix was collected 48 hours after transfection, 
sterile filtered, and aliquots were stored at -80°C until 
use. Cells were infected using a volume of 0.5 to 2 ml 
of this virus mix per 6-well. Where applicable, infected 
cells were selected with 3 μg/ml puromycin. To induce the 
expression of shRNAs from pTIP vectors the tetracycline 
analogue Doxycycline (Dox) was added to the culture at a 
final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. To label nuclei red cells 
were infected with a puromycine selectable NucLight Red 
lentivirus (Essen Bioscience).
Lentiviral vectors
To determine whether RNAi active sequences are 
taken up by the cells and active, cells were infected with 
lentivirus Venus sensors. They contain either a minisensor 
comprised of the 50 nucleotides surrounding the siL3 
target site in CD95L (Venus-siL3WT), the mutated siL3 
target site (Venus-siL3MUT) (described below), or the 
entire open reading frame of the CD95L-gene (NCBI 
accession number NM_000639.1) as recently described 
[9]. 
The Venus-siL3 sensor vector was created by 
subcloning an insert containing the Venus ORF followed 
by an artificial 3’UTR composed of a 62 bp portion 
of the CD95L cDNA containing the siL3 target site 
(5’-GCCCTTCAATTACCCATAT-3’) into a modified 
pCD510B vector (System Bioscience) as the backbone. 
IDT synthesized the insert as both a sense and antisense 
DNA strand containing an XbaI restriction enzyme 
(RE) site at the 5’ end and an EcoRI RE site at the 3’ 
end. The annealed insert and the modified pCD510B 
vector were digested with XbaI (NEB #R0145) and 
EcoRI (NEB #R0101). Subsequent ligation with T4 
DNA ligase (NEB #M0202) created the pCD510B 
Venus-siL3 sensor vector. The Venus-siL3MUT sensor 
was generated by subcloning the Venus-siL3MUT 
insert into a modified CD510B-1 backbone [10] using 
XbaI and EcoRI. The insert was ordered as a synthetic 
gene from IDT containing an XbaI site and EcoRI site 
at the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively and was composed 
of the Venus open reading frame followed by the 
sequence 
5’-CTCGAGAGCTGCCGTGCAGCAGGA 
CTTCAACTAGACATCTCCCCAGATCTACTGGG-3’, 
which contains the mutant siL3 sense sequence.
To monitor the growth of tumor cells in NSG 
mice by quantifying bioluminescence, the cells were 
infected with lentivirus pFU-Luc2-eGFP (pFUL2G), 
pFU-Luc2-tdTomato (pFUL2T) (a kind gift of Dr. Sanjiv 
Sam Gambhir at Stanford University, Stanford CA), or 
FUW-LucNeo (LucNeo) (G418 selectable) (received 
from Dr. Jian-Jun Wei, Northwestern University). To 
express shRNAs derived from the CD95 or CD95L 
gene, cells were infected with the following MISSION

Western blot analysis
Protein extracts were collected by lysing cells with 
RIPA lysis buffer [150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl ph7.2, 
1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 5 mM 
EDTA, protein inhibitor cocktail tablet (1 tablet per 10 
ml lysis buffer)]. 200 μM PMSF was added to the lysis 
buffer prior to use. Protein concentration was quantified 
using the DCTM Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). 30 μg of protein 
were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 
nitrocellulose membranes (AmershamTM Protran TM, pre 
size 0.45 µm GE Healthcare Life Science) overnight at 25 
mA. To verify the protein bands, a protein size marker was 
included on the gel, Amersham ECL Rainbow Molecular 
Weight Marker (GE Healtcare Life Science, Cat.No.: 
RPN800E). Membranes were incubated with blocking 
buffer (5% non-fat milk in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) 
for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were then 
incubated with the primary antibody diluted in blocking 
buffer over night at 4°C. Membranes were washed 3 times 
with PBST. Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking 
buffer and applied to membranes for 1 hour at room 
temperature. After 3 more additional washes, detection 
was performed using the ECL
TM Western Blotting 
Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare) or SuperSignalTM 
West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (ThermoFisher 
Sci.) and visualized with the chemiluminescence imager 
G:BOX Chemi XT4 (Syngene). All primary and secondary 
antibodies were diluted in a blocking buffer (5% non-
fat milk in PBST) at different dilutions. The following 
primary antibodies were used: anti-human Fas antibody 
(C-20) Polyclonal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology 
Inc., Cat.No.: sc-715, 1:500), anti-Scavenger receptor 
type B-1 rabbit IgG monoclonal [EP1556Y] (Abcam, 
Cat.No.: ab52629, 1:2000), and anti-Actin (I-19) goat 
polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Cat.No.: 
sc-1616, 1:2000). All secondary antibodies labeled with 
horse radish peroxidase: goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Cat.No.: sc-2004; 1:8000), 
rabbit anti goat IgG (Human adsorbed)-HRP (Santa Cruz

CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to delete the entire 
CD95L gene in 293T cells
The procedure to generate specific mutant cells 
using two guide RNAs was recently described [9]. In 
short, the pMJ920 Cas9 vector (expressing a Cas9-GFP 
conjugate) was transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 
(Invitrogen, Cat# 11668-019) with two guide RNA 
scaffolds containing guide RNA sequences targeting 
both 5’ and 3’ of the FASLG mRNA sequence to 
generate genomic human CD95L knock out cells. The 
following guide RNAs were designed using the online 
CRISPR design tool (crispr.mit.edu described in [19]. 
Guide sequences with a quality score > 70 were tested. 
The final guides used to generate FASLG knockouts 
are as follows (PAM sequence is underlined): 5’ guide 
sequence (ATTGTGGGCGGAAACTTCCAGGG), 3’ 
guide sequence (CTAATAGAGTGGCTTAGTAGTGG), 
were transfected as G-blocks (IDT) into 293T cells. As a 
control, the Cas9 vector was transfected alone, without the 
addition of G-blocks encoding guide RNAs. The G block 
sequences were adopted from [20] and are as follows: 5’

Cells successfully transfected were enriched by 
FACS sorting the top 20% GFP fluorescing cells three 
days after transfection (Day 1 transfection, Day 2 change

system was used. The cells were replated to recover. 
After 13 days in culture, single 1:1 fresh media: cells 
were sorted into 96 well plates containing not justified

Transfection with short oligonucleotides
For transfection of cancer cells with siRNAs 
Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX or 2000 transfection reagent 
was used at a concentration that was optimized for each 
cell line, following the instructions of the vendor. The 
same sequences were ordered from two different vendors, 
Dharmacon and Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT): 
Dharmacon: Lyophilized ON-Target plus siRNA were 
resuspended in 1 x siRNA buffer (using 5x buffer from 
Dharmacon, through Thermo Fisher Scientific Biosciences, 
Cat. No.: B-002000-UB, diluted with RNAse/DNAse free 
water, to 60 mM KCl, 6 mM HEPES-pH 7.5, 0.2 mM 
MgCl2) to a concentration of 20 μM. IDT: Individual RNA 
oligos were ordered for the sense and antisense oligo; the 
sense strand had 2 Ts added to the 3’ end; antisense strand 
had 2 deoxy As at the 3’ end, and phosphate residue on 
the 5’ end. For the visualization of siRNA-uptake a Cy5 
label was attached to the 5’ end of the sense strand. Sense 
and antisense oligos were first resuspended in water at 
500 μM (stock), then sense and antisense oligos were 
mixed with nuclease free Duplex buffer (IDT, Cat.No# 
11-01-03-01; 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES, 
pH 7.5) to 20 μM (working solution), heated up for 2 
minutes at 94°C, then the oligos were allowed to cool 
down to room temperature for 30 minutes. All siRNA 
solutions were aliquoted and stored at -80°C. The cells 
were transfected with siRNAs at a final concentration 
of 5 nM - 25 nM. The following siRNA sequences 
were used: siNT#2: UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA 
(Dharmacon D-001810-02, non targeting in mammalian 
cells), 
siL2: 
CAACGUAUCUGAGCUCUCU 
(Dharmacon J-011130-06, human CD95L exon 4), 
siL3: 
GCCCUUCAAUUACCCAUAU 
(Dharmacon 
J-011130-07, human CD95L exon 1.), siL3MUT: 
GGACUUCAACUAGACAUCU (siL3 sequence with 6 
changes), siL3-Cy5: GCCCUUCAAUUACCCAUAU-
Cy5 (siL3 sequence with Cy5 fluorophore).
Total RNA isolation and RNA-seq analysis
HeyA8 cells were transfected in 6-wells with 
IDT siNT2 or siL3 oligonucleotides at 25 nM. The 
transfection mix was removed after 9 hours. Total RNA 
was isolated 48 hours after initial transfection using the 
miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat.No. 74004)) following 
the manufacturers instructions. An on column digestion 
step using the RNAse-free DNAse Set (Qiagen, Cat.No.: 
79254) was included. NGS RNA-SEQ library making and 
sequencing was performed by the University of Chicago 
Genomics Facility. The quality and quantity of RNA 
samples was assessed using an Agilent bio-analyzer. RNA-
SEQ libraries were generated using Illumina Stranded 
TotalRNA TruSeq kits using the Illumina provided 
protocol and sequencing was performed using the Illumina 
HiSEQ4000 using Illumina provided protocols and 
reagents. Sequences were aligned to the human genome 
and analyzed as recently described [9]. The accession 
number for the RNA-Seq and expression data reported in 
this paper is GSE101167.
Monitoring growth and fluorescence expression 
over time
To monitor cell growth over time, cells were seeded 
between 125 or 10,000 per well in a 96-well plate in 
triplicates. The plate was then scanned using the IncuCyte 
ZOOM live cell imaging system (Essen BioScience). 
Images were captured at regular intervals, at the indicated 
time points, using an 10x objective. Cell confluence, red 
object count, and the green object integrated intensity were 
calculated using the IncuCyte ZOOM software (version 
2015A).
Synthesis of templated lipoprotein particles (TLP) 
and siRNA-TLPs
For TLP synthesis, an aqueous solution of citrate 
stabilized gold nanoparticles (Au NP) (80 nM, 5 ± 0.75 
nm, Ted Pella, Inc.) was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess 
of purified human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) (400 nM, 
Meridian Life Sciences, > 95% pure by SDS PAGE) in 
a glass vial. The AuNP/ apo A-I mixture was incubated 
overnight at room temperature (RT) in a flat bottom shaker 
at low speed. Next, a 1:1 ratio of two phospholipids: 
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[3-
(2-pyridyldithio) propionate] (PDP-PE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-
sn-glycero-3-phophocholine (DOPC) (Avanti Polar 
Lipids), each dissolved in chloroform (CHCl3, 1 mM), 
were added to the AuNP/ apo A-I solution in 250-fold 
molar excess to the AuNP. PDP-PE was added first and 
the solution was vortexed prior to adding DOPC. Next, 
cholesterol dissolved in CHCl3 (1 mM, Sigma Aldrich)

was added in 25-fold molar excess to the AuNP. The 
mixture was vortexed and briefly sonicated (~ 2 min) 
causing the solution to become opaque and pink in color. 
The resulting mixture was gradually heated to ~65°C 
with constant stirring to evaporate CHCl3 and to transfer 
the phospholipids onto the particle surface and into the 
aqueous phase (~20 minutes). The reaction was complete 
when the solution returned to a transparent red color. 
The resultant TLPs were incubated overnight at RT and 
then purified via centrifugation (15,870 x g, 50 min) or 
tangential flow filtration (TFF). The supernatant was 
removed in the case of centrifugation and the resulting 
purified and concentrated TLPs were combined into 
a single vial. TLPs were stored at 4°C until use. The 
concentration of the TLPs was measured using UV-
Vis spectroscopy (Agilent 8453) where AuNPs have 
a characteristic absorption at λmax = 520 nm, and the 
extinction coefficient for 5 nm AuNPs is 9.696 x 106 
M-1cm-1.
To synthesize siRNA-TLP, RNA and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-
trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) were first mixed. 
Individual sense and antisense RNA sequences of the 
siL2, siL3, or scrambled (siScr) (IDT) were re-suspended 
in nuclease free water (500 μM, final). Complement pairs 
were then mixed in nuclease free water at a concentration 
enabling direct addition to TLPs (100 nM) at 25-fold molar 
excess of each RNA sequence (2.5 μM, final per RNA 
sequence). An ethanolic (EtOH) solution of DOTAP was 
then added to the RNA mixture to desired DOTAP:RNA 
molar ratios. In each case the resulting solvent ratio was 
9:1, EtOH:water (v/v). The mixture of DOTAP and RNA 
was briefly sonicated and vortexed (x3) and then incubated 
at RT for 15 minutes prior to addition to a solution of TLPs 
in water. After the DOTAP-RNA mixture was added to 
the TLPs, the solvent mixture was 9:1, water:EtOH (v/v). 
The solution was incubated overnight at RT with gentle 
shaking on a flat bottom shaker at low speed. Resulting 
siRNA-TLPs were purified via centrifugation (15,870 x g, 
50 min), the supernatant with unbound starting materials 
was removed, the pellets were briefly sonicated and then 
combined in a single tube to concentrate the siRNA-TLPs. 
The concentration of the siRNA-TLPs was calculated as 
described for TLP. For siRNA-TLPs, a strong absorption 
at λmax = 260 nm confirmed the presence of RNA. 
Monitoring of Cy5-labeled particle uptake
For FACS analysis, cells were plated at 50,000 cells 
per 12-well plate in 1 ml medium. After about 16 hours 
the entire medium was replaced with medium containing 
10 nM TLP. After 24 hours incubation with the particles, 
the cells were harvested, trypsinized when necessary, and 
analyzed with FACS. For IncuCyte monitoring, cells were 
plated at 10000, 5000, 2500, and 1250 cells per 96-well. 
Images for phase, and the red channel were taken every 
2.5 hours.
Intra peritoneal (i.p.) injection of ovarian cancer 
cells into NSG mice and in vivo imaging
105-106 modified HeyA8 (always infected with 
a luciferase lentivirus) were injected i.p. into 6-week-
old female NSG mice (NOD scid gamma, NOD-scid 
IL2Rgnull, NOD-scid IL2Rgammanul) (Jackson Laboratory, 
Cat.No.: 005557) following the Northwestern University 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-
approved protocol. The growth of tumor cells in the 
mice over time was monitored non-invasively using the 
IVIS® Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Perkin Elmer). 
The tumor load was quantified by the luminescence of 
the regions of interest (the same area for each mouse 
encompassing the entire abdomen) using the Living 
Image software. To visualize the tumor load in the mice, 
200 µl of the sterile luciferin stock solution (15 mg/ml 
in Dulbeccos’s phosphate buffered saline without Mg2+ 
and Ca2+) was i.p. injected per mouse (which equals 
approximately 10 µl of luciferin stock per g of body 
weight). The mice were imaged 15 minutes after injection. 
Total Flux values of the different treatment groups were 
compared. 
H&E staining
Tissue samples or tumors were fixed in 10% 
Normal Buffered Formalin (VWR, Cat.No.: 16004-128) 
for 16 hrs, and further processed by the Northwestern 
University Mouse Histology & Phenotyping Laboratory 
(MHPL) (paraffin embedding, sectioning at 4 μM, slide 
preparation, and staining). Histology services were 
provided by the Northwestern University Research 
Histology and Phenotyping Laboratory at the Robert H. 
Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
Microscopy and imaging
The following microscopes were used for 
imaging: Zeiss Axioscope with Nuance camera (Nuance 
multispectral imaging system) with the software called 
Nuance 3.0.0. to image Venus green and tdTomato Red. 
Imaging work on this microscope was performed at the 
Northwestern University Center for Advanced Microscopy. 
A Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescence microscope equipped 
with an Axiocam digital camera, and the software 
AxioVision Rel 4.8. was used to image samples with 
Venus green and Red Fluorescent protein. Images of 
histological slides, H&E images were taken on a Leica 
DM 4000B Light microscope D (Leica Microsystems) 
equipped with a Leica DFC320 color digital camera (Leica 
Microsystems). The software program used to capture the 
images was called Leica Application Suite version 44.0 
(Build:454).

RNAi targeting of Venus-sensor - analysis by 
FACS
To analyze tumors by FACS, tumors were isolated 
from the peritoneal cavity of a mouse, washed in PBS, 
and dissociated with trypsin. After the cell suspension was 
strained over a 70 μm Fisherbrand® nylon mesh (Fisher 
Scientific, Cat.No.: 22363548), the suspension of cells 
was analyzed by FACS. BD LSRFortessa Analyser at 
the Flow Cytometry Core, Northwestern University, was 
used for flow analyses. The data was analyzed using the 
program FlowJo 8.8.6. To ensure that only tumor cells 
were analyzed, only the red events (NucRed or pFUL2T 
infected cancer cells) were considered. The percentage of 
high green and low green expressing cells were quantified. 
For assessing the granularity of the tumors cells, the values 
of the side scatter area were compared between treatments.
RNAi targeting of Venus-sensor - analysis by 
fluorescence microscopy
Tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (a 32% 
Paraformaldehyde stock solution, EM grade (Electron 
Microcopy Sciences, Cat.No.: 15714-S)) was diluted 
with deionized water) over night, followed by a sucrose 
gradient (10 % sucrose for 2 hours, 20 % sucrose for 2 
hours, 30 % sucrose overnight), before they were shock 
frozen in Tissue-Plus® O.C.T. Compound Embedding 
medium (Scigen Scientific Gardena, CA, Cat.No.: 4583) 
following standard tissue freezing procedures. The frozen 
O.C.T blocks were sectioned at 6 um, mounted on slides 
by the MHPL (Northwestern University), and stored at 
-80°C until use. To assess the effect of the treatment on the 
Venus-fluorescence, slides with the section were thawed 
at room temperature, washed gently three times with 
PBS buffer, and mounted with a coverslip using Antifade 
VectaShield + DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., CA, Cat.
No.: H-1200). Images of tumors with different treatments 
were taken on the Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescence 
microscope with the identical settings. Tumor cells all 
expressed a red fluorophore, which allowed to compare 
tumor areas with high as well as low green fluorescent 
Venus-sensor expression.
Serum collection and toxicity test
Two mice from each TLP treatment group were 
selected as representatives to assess TLP toxicity. Whole 
blood was collected from each mouse via retro-orbital 
bleeding using disposable glass Pasteur pipettes when 
mice were sedated. Blood was then allowed to gravity drip 
into Greiner Bio-One™ MiniCollect™ Capillary Blood 
Collection System Tubes (Fisher Scientific, Cat.No.: 
22-030-400) that were kept on ice. The collection tubes 
containing the serum were spun at 3000 g for 10 minutes 
at 15°C. After completion of the spin, two layers formed 
in the tube. The top layer containing the whole serum was 
collected, volume measured, transferred to new sterile 
Eppendorf™ Snap-Cap Microcentrifuge Safe-Lock™ 
Tubes (Fisher Scientific, Cat.No.: 05-402-25), frozen, and 
stored at -20°C. The serum samples were analyzed using a 
Complete Chemistry Profile Test performed by the Charles 
River Research Animal Diagnostic Services (Wilmington, 
MA).
Statistical methods
Two-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) were 
performed using the STATA14 software to compare 
growth curves. One-tail student t-test was performed in 
the software package R to compare tumor load between 
treatment groups. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was performed 
in R to compare IVIS signal between treatment groups.
