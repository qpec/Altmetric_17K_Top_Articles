 IgE is an ancient and conserved immunoglobulin isotype with potent immune function. 
Nevertheless, the regulation of IgE responses remains enigmatic and evidence for a role of IgE in 
host defense is limited. Herein we describe that topical exposure to a common environmental 
DNA-damaging xenobiotic initiated stress-surveillance by γδTCR+ intraepithelial lymphocytes 
resulting in class-switching to IgE in B cells and accumulation of autoreactive IgE. High-
throughput antibody sequencing revealed that γδ T cells shaped the IgE repertoire by supporting 
specific VDJ rearrangements with unique CDRH3 characteristics. This endogenous IgE response, 
via the FcεRI, protected against epithelial carcinogenesis and FceR1a expression in human 
squamous cell carcinoma correlated with good disease prognosis. This data indicate a joint role for 
T and B cell immune-surveillance in epithelial tissues and suggests that IgE is part of the host 
defense against epithelial damage and tumor development.
IgE is an ancient and highly conserved immunoglobulin isotype found in all mammals1. It is 
thought that IgE has evolved to provide protection against infection by macroparasites, such 
as helminths. However, although IgE is elevated in both mice and humans with helminth 
infections, IgE is not critical for protective immunity against helminths and much of the IgE 
raised is not parasite-specific2. An alternative hypothesis suggests that IgE is important for 
immune responses against environmental toxins such as venoms3, and indeed, recent data 
indicates that IgE can protect against bee venom and limit snake venom toxicity4, 5, 6. 
Furthermore, aberrant IgE responses causing allergies are frequently directed at 
environmental irritants and non-replicating agents. A role for IgE in defending against 
immediate danger would be consistent with the very rapid mobilization of its effector 
functions. Therefore a broader paradigm proposes that IgE represents an arm of early 
immune host-defense against xenobiotics or large parasites threatening tissue integrity7. 
However, what drives these IgE responses in vivo, what they recognize and whether they 
play a wider role in immune defense remain unknown.
IgE responses occur most frequently in epithelial tissues such as the skin, lung and gut, 
which contain resident IgE-binding cells. These barrier surfaces are continuously exposed to 
challenges from environmental xenobiotics and a prominent feature of their response to 
external insults is induction of type 2 immunity8 and IgE9, 10. In the murine skin epithelia, 
a resident γδTCR+ population of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) controls tissue 
homeostasis via induction of IL-1311, a type 2 cytokine, and also promotes IgE upon 
challenge with protein allergens on stressed tissue12. These IELs can directly sense 
epithelial cell dysregulation via stress-sensing receptors, such as NKG2D, and this pathway 
plays a key role in promoting the IgE response12, 13. The capacity of IELs to detect 
epithelial cell stress and initiate a restorative response has been termed lymphoid stress-
surveillance and plays an important role in early detection of stressed and pre-malignant 
cells13. Indeed, tissue-specific IELs regulate epithelial tissue integrity and are key to host-
protection against carcinogenesis11, 13.
Many toxins and xenobiotics are also carcinogens. Hence, in defending against 
environmental xenobiotics, IgE may simultaneously confer protection against transformation 
and cancer in exposed tissues. Here we report the development of a potent and dominant IgE 
response following topical exposure to the common environmental xenobiotic and

 carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). This endogenous IgE response was 
autoreactive and was required for protection against cutaneous carcinogenesis. Further, we 
show that tissue-resident γδTCR+ IELs had a unique role in initiating and regulating IgE 
production, driving an early, innate-like response, which directed a subsequent adaptive 
response supported by IL-4-producing CD4+ αβ T cells. Deep-sequencing of IgE and IgG1 
from germinal center (GC) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) indicated that γδTCR+ IELs 
shaped a distinct IgE repertoire that was dependent on the presence of DNA-damage in 
epithelial cells. Thus, lymphoid stress-surveillance promoted a unique IgE response, which 
was part of an early host defense mechanism providing protection against cancer.
Results
Carcinogen-induced epithelial cell damage triggers IgE responses
DNA-damaging xenobiotics such as DMBA are commonly found in the environment and 
have been implicated in carcinogenesis14, 15. We found that a single topical application of 
DMBA to the back skin of wild-type mice induced an IgE response in serum within 4 days 
(Fig. 1a). DMBA exposure was associated with upregulation of the NKG2D-ligand Rae-1 on 
skin epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a), indicating epithelial cell stress. The number of 
epithelial cells containing double-stranded (ds) DNA-breaks, assessed by staining for the 
phosphorylated histone H2A variant H2AX (γH2AX), peaked between 3-7 days after 
DMBA exposure (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) must 
metabolize DMBA to the more mutagenic compound DMBA-trans-3,4-dihydrodio to cause 
substantial DNA-damage. Langerin-DTA mice, which do not have LCs, showed less 
epithelial cell DNA-damage following a single dose of DMBA16 (Supplementary Fig. 1d) 
and failed to show increased serum IgE compared to non-transgenic littermate controls 
(NLC) (Fig. 1b). However, Langerin-DTA mice generated IgE to other topical challenges12 
and, if exposed to DMBA repeatedly, they developed both DNA-damage and IgE responses 
(Supplementary Fig. 1d,e). Other DNA-damaging skin challenges such as UV-irradiation 
also induced IgE (Supplementary Fig 1f,g). Once weekly exposure to DMBA led to the 
development of papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) after 8-15 weeks. This 
was associated with high amounts of serum IgE, which rose progressively as epithelial 
DNA-damage accumulated (Fig. 1c). When DMBA was given daily for 5 days only, mice 
developed skin tumors and serum IgE showed a progressive rise during 12 weeks 
(Supplementary Fig. 1h). The systemic IgE responses were paralleled by infiltration and 
accumulation of IgE in acutely damaged skin (Fig. 1d) and in skin tumors (Fig. 1d,e). The 
tissue IgE was mainly carried by FcεRI-expressing basophils (Fig. 1d). More mature IgE 
transcripts were expressed in the tumor tissue than the adjacent skin, indicating some local 
IgE production, whereas IgG1 and IgM transcripts were lower in tumors than adjacent skin 
(Fig. 1f). This data indicate that the epithelial cell damage triggered by DMBA exposure 
potently promoted IgE production which accumulated in the resulting skin tumors.
Topical carcinogen exposure induces local B cell class-switching
To investigate the origin of the DMBA-induced IgE response, we examined B cells in the 
skin-draining LNs during acute DMBA exposure (pre-malignancy). Two applications of 
DMBA, 3 days apart, on the ear skin induced enlarged skin-draining LNs with formation of

 GCs and class-switching of GC B cells (Fig. 2a) as well as increased numbers of CD138+ 
PCs, which had class-switched primarily to IgE and IgG1, with little or no induction of 
IgG2a (Fig. 2b). There was no induction of GCs or class-switched PCs in the spleen (data 
not shown), suggesting the response was localized to the skin-draining LNs. Weekly 
exposures to DMBA on back skin for 5 weeks also induced GCs and IgE+ and IgG1+ PCs. 
However, under these conditions, the GC structures and the IgG1+ PCs diminished from 
week 3, resulting in a dominant IgE response (Fig. 2c). By week 5 post-exposure, nearly 
80% of all CD138+ PCs in the LNs had switched to IgE (Fig. 2c). Thus, skin exposure to 
DMBA promotes a local type 2 B cell response with dominant and prevailing IgE 
production.
Carcinogen-induced IgE protects against carcinogenesis
To explore whether the IgE response induced by DMBA was important for host defense, we 
assessed skin tumor formation in Igh7-/- mice, which lack IgE. Following once weekly 
DMBA exposure Igh7-/- mice developed tumors sooner and more rapidly, as well as 
significantly more and larger tumors than their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 3a). The IgG1 
response in the DMBA-treated Igh7-/- mice was identical to wild-type mice (Supplementary 
Fig. 2a). In addition, the number of IgE-effector cells in the tissue was similar to wild-type 
(Supplementary Figure 3a). FceR1a-/ mice, which lack the high affinity receptor for IgE, 
also had enhanced susceptibility to DMBA carcinogenesis compared to wild-type (Fig 3b), 
despite having similar IgE and IgG1 amounts in serum (Supplementary Fig 2b), suggesting 
the protective effect of IgE was mediated by signaling through FcεRI. CD45locKit-FcεRI+ 
basophils represented the main IgE+ cell population in the tumors (Fig. 1d). Cpa3Cre/+ mice, 
which have Cre-recombinase inserted in the Cpa3 locus, and lack skin mast cells, showed 
similar susceptibility to tumor development as Cpa3+/+ littermates following DMBA 
carcinogenesis, suggesting that, most likely, FcεRI+ basophils mediated the protection 
against carcinogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Splenic CD45locKit-CD41+FcεRI+ 
basophils from Igh7-/- mice produced IL-4 and IL-6 and degranulated equivalent to 
basophils from wild-type spleens upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation, however the skin 
tumour cytokine microenvironment was significantly altered in Igh7-/- mice compared to 
wild-type (Supplementary Fig. 3c-e).
To investigate whether similar IgE responses occur in humans, we analyzed newly incised 
skin SSC samples from 12 patients. FcεRI+ cells were found in all tumor and peri-lesional 
skin samples, varying in frequency from around 1% to over 40% of the tumor infiltrating 
CD45+ leukocytes (Fig. 3c). The FcεRI+ cells were mainly found in the peritumoral 
infiltrate at the interface between the stroma and the neoplastic keratinocytes with some 
entering the tumor and/or hair follicle (averaging 11.7±2.9 cells per mm2) (Supplementary 
Fig. 4). FcεRI+ cells accumulated more in the skin compared to matched blood samples, 
however, tumor tissue contained fewer FcεRI+ cells than histopathologically healthy peri-
lesional skin from the same patient (Fig. 3c). In an additional cohort of 56 SCC patients, 
gene-expression analysis revealed that expression of FceR1a mRNA was higher in 
unaffected skin areas than in developed tumors, with the lowest expression of FceR1a 
mRNA detected in high-risk and metastatic SCCs (Fig. 3d). A significant linear trend was 
observed between FceR1a mRNA expression and the risk for more advanced SSC (Fig. 3d).

 Together these data indicate that IgE, via FcεRI, protected against DMBA-induced SCC and 
that fewer FcεRI-expressing leukocytes in human SSC correlates with risk of more severe 
disease.
Carcinogen-induced humoral immunity depends on αβ
αβ T cell-derived IL-4
Conventional and non-conventional modes of inducing class-switching to IgE have been 
described8. We first explored whether induction of tumor-protective IgE was dependent on 
αβ T cells. Tcrb-/- mice, which lack αβ T cells, had no enlargement of skin-draining LNs, 
no GCs, and no IgG1+ or IgE+ PCs following twice topical DMBA to the ear skin compared 
to wild-type mice (Fig. 4a). The response was restored by transferring polyclonal CD4+ T 
cells, but not TCR-restricted transgenic OTII CD4+ T cells in Tcrb-/- mice (Supplementary 
Fig. 5a), indicating it was dependent on a normal TCR repertoire. Furthermore, injection of 
α-CD40L blocking antibody partially inhibited LN enlargement and repressed GC 
formation and generation of IgE+ and IgG1+ PCs in wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 
5b). Similar defects in class-switching to IgE+ and IgG1+ PCs were seen Il4-/- mice, which 
cannot produce IL-4, although Il4-/- mice showed an enlargement of LNs comparable to 
wild-type mice and had some GC B cells (Fig. 4a). Il4-/- mice had some class-switching to 
IgG2a, which was never observed in wild-type or in Tcrb-/- mice (data not shown). Wild-
type→Il4-/- BM chimeras induced IgE+ and IgG1+ PCs comparably to wild-type→wild-
type chimeras following topical DMBA treatment, whereas Il4-/-→wild-type chimeras 
induced significantly less IgE+ and IgG1+ PCs (Supplementary Fig. 5c), indicating IL-4 was 
derived from haemapoeitic cells, and not irradiation-resistant skin-resident cells. To test 
whether the requirement for αβ T cell for IgE/IgG1 class-switching reflected a need for 
IL-4, we reconstituted Tcrb-/- mice with wild-type or Il4-/- CD4+ T cells 24hr prior to 
DMBA exposure. Only the wild-type CD4+ αβ T cells were able to rescue the GC response 
and IgG1/IgE production in the skin-draining LN of the reconstituted Tcrb-/- mice (Fig. 4b). 
Moreover, Il4-/- mice showed significantly earlier onset, higher incidence of tumors and 
larger tumors compared to wild-type controls following weekly DMBA treatment (Fig. 4c), 
indicating that IL-4 was required for tumor protection. Tumor-bearing Il4-/- mice did not 
produce IgE and had diminished production of IgG1, but higher IgG2a, in serum compared 
to wild-type (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Thus, αβ T cell-derived IL-4 is critical for IgE 
production and tumor protection following DMBA exposure.
Induction of tumor-protective IgE requires γδ
γδ TCR+ IEL
Skin γδTCR+ IELs are key for protective immunity against chemical carcinogenesis and are 
strong inducers of local type 2 immune responses11, 12, 13. We found that Tcrd-/- mice, 
which lack γδ T cells, had less LN hypertrophy following topical DMBA exposure to the 
ear skin, but normal numbers of GC B cells compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 5a). Tcrd-/- 
mice developed comparable IgG1+ PCs, but had significantly impaired IgE PC responses 
compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 5a). The reduction in IgE was already detected at day 4, a 
time-point when the numbers of IgE+ PCs and serum IgE were increased in wild-type mice, 
but remained undetectable in Tcrd-/- mice (Fig. 5a,b). GCs were not yet enlarged in wild-
type mice at day 4 (Fig. 5a), suggesting that the γδ T cell-dependent IgE response at this 
time may be of extra-follicular origin. To explore this, we utilized CD19creBcl-6fl/fl mice, 
which have a B cell-specific defect in the transcription factor Bcl-6. CD19creBcl-6fl/fl mice

 did not develop a GC response following topical DMBA application, despite LN 
enlargement, but the number of IgE+ and IgG1+ PCs in the LN were equivalent to in Bcl-6 
heterozygous littermates and wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 5d). We next asked 
whether the γδ T cells involved in the response were located in the skin itself or in a 
secondary lymphoid organ such as the draining-LNs. Skin resident γδTCR+ IELs are 
radiation-resistant11 and in Tcrd-/-→wild-type and wild-type→Tcrd-/- BM chimeras γδ T 
cells were detected only in the skin or LNs respectively (Fig. 5c). When these chimeras were 
treated topically with DMBA, IgE was significantly reduced only in wild-type→Tcrd-/- 
chimeras, in which γδTCR+ IELs were missing from the skin, but γδ T cells were present in 
the LNs, compared to wild-type chimeric controls (Fig. 5d). The number of IgG1+ PCs was 
similar in Tcrd-/-→wild-type, wild-type→Tcrd-/- and control chimeras (Fig. 5d). The Vγ4+ 
and other ‘non-Vγ5+’ γδ T cells in the skin of Tcrd-/-→wild-type, wild-type→Tcrd-/- 
chimeras were similar to wild-type chimeric controls (Fig. 5c). In addition, Vg5Vd1-/- mice, 
which lack only the canonical Vγ5Vδ1+ IELs, had fewer IgE+ PCs following topical DMBA 
treatment compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 5e), suggesting that Vγ5+ IELs were most likely 
the IgE-promoting γδ T cell subset. These observations indicate that DMBA-induced IgE 
depended on γδTCR+ IEL in the tissue.
γδ
γδ T cells promote a distinct IgE repertoire in response to carcinogen
To understand the nature of the humoral response produced during epithelial cell damage, 
and the role of γδ T cell immune-surveillance, we sorted B220+CD95+GL7+ GC B cells and 
FSChiCD95hiCD138+ PCs from the skin draining LNs of wild-type and Tcrd-/- mice 7 days 
after the last of two topical DMBA exposures. Analysis of the IgG1 and IgE heavy-chain 
repertoires using high-throughput sequencing revealed that IgE-producing clones had the 
largest clone expansion in wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a). As expected, the average 
clone sizes for IgG1 were greater amongst PCs than GC B cells (Fig. 6a). In contrast, IgE 
clones among PCs and GC B cells were equivalent and were larger than IgG1 clones (Fig. 
6a). Furthermore, Tcrd-/- mice had defective IgE clone expansion in GC B cells compared to 
wild-type, while IgG1 clone expansion was similar (Fig. 6b). Alakazam tool17, an analysis 
framework for adaptive immune-receptor repertoire sequencing, indicated that the IgE+ PC 
repertoire was significantly less diverse in Tcrd-/- compared with wild-type mice in all but 
the most common clones (Fig. 6c). In contrast, the IgG1+ PC repertoire diversity in Tcrd-/- 
mice was similar to wild-type (Fig. 6c).
We also analyzed the physicochemical properties of the CDRH3 regions using principal 
component analysis (PCA) of Kidera factors18, which are a set of independent factors 
encapsulating information from 188 different biophysical characteristics of the 20 amino 
acids. We observed clear differences in the CDRH3 protein structure between GC B cells 
and PCs as well as between IgG1-switched and IgE-switched clones in wild-type mice (Fig. 
6d), indicating that the majority of IgE+ PC clones were of extra-follicular origin and had 
switched directly from IgM to IgE. This was supported by clonal analysis, which indicated 
that <30% of IgE+ PC clones were shared with IgG1+ PC clones and only around 30% of 
IgE+ PC clones were shared with IgE+ GC clones (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). Furthermore, 
Kidera PCA showed that the properties of IgE and IgG1 in Tcrd-/- mice were different from

 those of wild-type mice, suggesting that immune-surveillance by γδ T cells had a role in 
selecting the physiochemical properties of the CDRH3 regions (Fig. 6d).
Selection events are also expected to shape the B cell repertoire in terms of V, D, J gene-
usage. We found that only 5 major IgHV and 5 IgHD family genes were commonly used, 
but all 4 IGHJ genes were used for both IgG1+ and IgE+ GC B cells and PCs 
(Supplementary Fig. 6d-f). The third most frequent D gene in both IgE+ and IgG1+ GC B 
cells and PCs could not be annotated by IMGT, most likely due to an IGHD gene in the FVB 
genome that is absent from the IMGT genomic data, as the heavy chain repertoire is highly 
variable between inbred strains19. We annotated this new gene as Dx. 3D analysis of VDJ 
usage in IgE+ PCs indicated that V1D2 was the dominant selection (Fig. 6e), consistent with 
data showing that the IgHV1 family is most frequently used in mouse Ig19, 20. J usage was 
approximately equal between the 4 J family groups (Fig. 6e). The VDJ analysis also 
revealed that some VDJ combinations in wild-type mice, particularly the novel V3Dx 
segment, were significantly less selected in IgE+ PCs from Tcrd-/- mice (Fig. 6e-g).
We next compared the physicochemical properties of CDRH3 in the wild-type V3Dx clones 
with those of V3D2 clones, which used the same V but different D gene, V1D2 clones, 
which were the most common selection and V14D2 clones, which did not require γδ T cell 
selection. Kidera factor PCA indicated that the V3Dx clones had unique CDRH3 
physicochemical characteristics (Fig. 6h) and contained a lower frequency of aromatic and 
small amino acids, but a higher frequency of aliphatic and basic amino acids, as well as a 
higher isoelectric point than clones of the other VD combinations (Fig. 6i). These 
characteristics suggest that the antigen-binding site was hydrophobic, with slight positive 
charge in the loop at blood pH. In addition, the V3Dx-expressing clones had shorter CDRH3 
regions than the V1D2 and V3D2 clones (Fig. 6i), indicating antigen selection21, 22, and 
carried fewer mutations (Fig. 6j), indicating they were more germline in nature. In sum, this 
data indicates that in response to DMBA, γδTCR+ T cells shaped the IgE repertoire by 
supporting specific VDJ rearrangements, resulting in unique characteristics of the CDRH3 
antigen-binding site that suggests polyreactive autologous binding.
DMBA-induced IgE is autoantigenic and differs from TPA-induced IgE
We next explored whether the IgE responses induced by topical DMBA were auto-reactive. 
We screened the binding of IgE, from serum of DMBA-treated wild-type mice, to human 
HEp2 cells and observed several strong staining patterns (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 
7a), indicating both autoreactivity and cross-species reactivity of IgE. The most common 
staining patterns of IgE on HEp2 cells were ‘nuclear dots’, which indicate anti-nuclear 
specificity and ‘cytoplasmic vesicles’ that resembled stress granules (Fig. 7a and 
Supplementary Fig. 7a). In addition, we detected IgE reactivity towards ds-DNA (Fig. 7b) 
and towards damaged epithelial cells, frequently around hair-follicles, in epidermal sheets 
from FceR1a-/- mice isolated 24hr after DMBA exposure (Supplementary Fig. 7f-g). We 
detected no autoreactivity against HEp2 cells with IgE from serum of DMBA-treated Tcrd-/- 
mice or IgE from serum of wild-type mice treated topically with 12-O-
tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 7b,c), which did not 
provoke epithelial cell DNA-damage (Fig. 7c), but triggers general skin inflammation.

 We next sorted FSChiCD95hiCD138+ PCs from the skin draining LNs of wild-type mice 
exposed topically to DMBA or TPA and compared their IgE heavy-chain repertoires using 
high-throughput sequencing. Alakazam analysis indicated that TPA-induced IgE+ PCs 
exhibited significantly less diversity throughout the repertoire compared to DMBA-induced 
IgE+ PCs (Fig. 7d). Kidera factor PCA indicated more heterogeneity in the CDRH3 regions 
of TPA-induced IgE compared with DMBA-induced IgE, with little overlap between the two 
responses (Fig. 7e). In parallel, VDJ gene family-usage amongst TPA-induced IgE was 
dominated by V1 genes, with significantly less selection for V3 and V14 genes compared to 
DMBA-induced IgE (Fig. 7f,g). Notably, TPA also did not generate the V3Dx-expressing 
clones, which we had found to be promoted by γδ T cells in response to DMBA-induced 
DNA-damage (Fig. 7g). Together these results indicate, that skin exposure to DMBA drove a 
unique, autoreactive IgE repertoire that was distinct from that induced in response to TPA, 
which induced local acute inflammation.
Discussion
Here we found that IgE was rapidly induced by cutaneous exposure to the carcinogen 
DMBA and accumulated in the skin and tumors on FcεRI-expressing basophils. The IgE 
response required γδTCR+ IELs, was autoreactive and protective against epithelial 
carcinogenesis. FcεRI-expressing cells also accumulated in human skin SCCs and 
expression level correlated with disease severity. Together, our data indicate that IgE 
contributes to early tissue immune-surveillance against environmental xenobiotics or toxins 
and has a protective role against epithelial tumor development.
Polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as DMBA are ubiquitous and arise from many sources, 
including car emissions and tobacco smoke14, 15. They are the main organic constituent in 
air pollution, and their levels correlate with the prevalence and severity of atopic 
dermatitis23, 24. In mice, chronic skin exposure to air pollutants can induce atopic 
dermatitis-like features and IgE production. However, whilst the skin gene expression 
depends on ligation of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by polyaromatic 
hydrocarbons, the increase in IgE does not25. Consistent with this, we found that initiation 
of IgE after topical DMBA depended on epithelial DNA-damage and not direct AhR 
engagement. Host DNA can selectively induce IgE26, suggesting that dying cells have 
unique IgE adjuvant activity. Furthermore, expression of autologous stress-antigens, such as 
NKG2D-ligands, on damaged skin epithelia promotes IgE production12. Topical TPA also 
induces NKG2D-ligand expression27, which may partly explain the induction of IgE by this 
agent. However, sequencing analysis revealed that different types of tissue-damage initiate 
distinct IgE repertoires. In humans, self-reactive IgE have been found in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematous28, 29, bullous pemphigoid30, atopic dermatitis31 and primary 
immune deficiencies32. These data suggests that IgE responses are potently promoted by 
autologous cell stress and/or damage, which is induced by skin exposure to environmental 
xenobiotics.
IELs provide a ‘first line of defense’ in epithelial tissues. A large proportion of IELs carry 
γδTCRs and are autoreactive in nature as they express receptors for tissue-specific stress-
molecules33. We show that following DMBA-induced epithelial damage IELs elicited rapid

 IgE in the parafollicular regions and subsequently triggered a conventional adaptive response 
requiring polyclonal αβTCR+ CD4+ T cells producing IL-4. This mode of IgE induction 
differs from regulation of self-reactive ‘natural IgE’, which is also γδ T cell-driven, but is 
independent of αβ T cells and MHCII34, 35. Deep-sequencing of IgG1+ and IgE+ GC B 
cells and PCs demonstrated that γδ T cells shaped the repertoire and the nature of the 
antibodies produced. Thus, antibody deep-sequencing revealed a previously unrecognized 
mode of B cell selection dictated by tissue-resident IELs.
γδ T cells and tissue-specific γδIELs are key players in host defense against cancer, which 
is considered to reflect innate properties such as cytotoxicity and cytokine production11, 13, 
27. Here we show that they can provide a ‘second line of host defense’ via initiation of 
adaptive autoreactive IgE responses and FcεRI-expressing effector cells. Our findings that 
endogenous IgE can suppress tumor growth are supported by evidence that immunization 
with tumor antigen-specific IgE can eradicate tumors and is more effective than IgG136, 37. 
How IgE inhibits tumor growth in our model remains to be determined, however it required 
FcεRI expression and mast cells were not essential, suggesting it may involve soluble factors 
and/or cytotoxicity mediated by basophils.
In humans, epithelial skin cancers are on the rise38, 39. In addition to UV-irradiation, 
environmental chemical carcinogens can also lead to skin SCC development, as indicated by 
the causal link between scrotal SCC and soot exposure, which contains polyaromatic 
hydrocarbons, in chimney sweeps40. Moreover, tobacco smokers, who are exposed to high 
amounts of polyaromatic benz[a]antracene, have a 50% increased likelihood of developing 
skin SCC41. Studies on IgE and cancer risk in humans show a significant, albeit weak, 
negative correlation between serum IgE and overall cancer risk42, 43. In addition, FceR1a 
was reported among the top 50 genes associated with positive survival in 39 human 
malignancies44. The presence of intratumoral γδ T cells was the most favorable prognostic 
indicator of cancer survival44, while a high number of infiltrating PCs was also strongly 
associated with good clinical outcome44. Consistent with these observations, we found that 
FcεRI-expressing cells were abundant in human SCCs and there was an inverse correlation 
between expression of FceR1a and more advanced disease. Of note, the use of omalizumab, 
a mAb blocking IgE, has been associated with more frequent development of cancer, 
particularly epithelial and solid organ cancers45.
Together these findings suggest that the IgE-FcεRI axis is part of a tumor-protective immune 
response and provides support for the ‘toxin hypothesis’, which proposes that IgE is a host 
defense mechanism against non-infectious cell-damaging environmental xenobiotics.

 were purchased from Charles River. Mice were bred and maintained in individually 
ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions. Age-matched, female mice were 
used for all experiments at ≥ 7 weeks of age and selected at random from a large pool when 
allocated to experiments. All studies were approved by Imperial College AWERB (Animal 
Welfare and Ethical Review Body) and by the UK Home Office. Experiments involving 
cancer studies strictly adhered to the guidelines set out by the National Cancer Research 
Institute (NCRI) and Workman et al. in ‘Guidelines for the Welfare and Use of Animals in 
Cancer Research’59. All studies using animals were conducted following the Animal 
Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines60.
Chemical cutaneous damage and carcinogenesis
Chemicals 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-
acetate (TPA) were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in acetone and 100% ethanol 
respectively. Acute damage was induced by exposing the dorsal sides of the ear skin to a 
single or repeated 200nM dose of DMBA or 2.5nM dose of TPA, in 25μl.
For cutaneous carcinogenesis age-matched female mice were used at 7 weeks of age. The 
dorsal back area was shaved with a surgical blade and mice rested for 1 week. Applications 
of chemicals and tumor monitoring were performed as previously described13. In brief, 
200nM DMBA was carefully and slowly applied by pipette, in a 100 μl volume, to the entire 
shaved skin area. Mice were rested for one week and 100nM DMBA then applied weekly. 
Hair regrowth during the experiment was gently removed by clipping with trimmers. Mice 
were monitored daily and cutaneous tumors were counted and measured with a caliper once 
weekly. Back skin and tumors were evaluated by visual inspection by an observer blinded to 
the experimental groups.
UV-irradiation
The back skin of FVB mice was shaved using electrical clippers 3 days before UV-
irradiation. Mice were exposed to the UV light source in their cages placed under four 100 
W UV lamps with the spectral output 270-350 nm (predominantly UVB) (Philips TL12 
lamps). The total dose of UVB radiation was monitored during each exposure using an 
IL-400 A UVB photometer (International Light). Mice were given 100mJ/cm2 three times a 
week.
Tissue Processing
Tissue was cut into small 1mm2 pieces using a scalpel blade and incubated for 2 hrs in 
digestion buffer containing 25ug/ml Liberase (Roche), 250ug/ml DNAseI (Roche) and 1x 
DNAse buffer (1.21 Tris base, 0.5g MgCl2 and 0.073g CaCl2) at 37°. Following digestion, 
tissue was transferred into C-tubes (Miltenyi Biotech) containing RPMI-1640 media 
(Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 1% Penicillin-
Streptomycin-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher) and physically disrupted using a Miltenyi cell 
dissociator. Cell suspensions were then filtered and cells counted using a CASY cell counter 
(Roche).

 Flow cytometry
Cell suspensions were blocked for non-specific binding using antibody against FcγR 
(2.4G2) and 2% normal rat serum (Sigma) prior to any staining protocols. For staining of 
cell surface markers, cell suspensions were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies 
or appropriate isotype control with the addition of a fixable, live/dead discrimination dye 
(Invitrogen) for 25 min and subsequently washed. Intracellular staining was then carried out 
using an Intracellular Staining kit as per manufacturer’s instruction (ThermoFisher 
Scientific). Cells were fixed for 10 min at 4°C, washed with Perm buffer and stained for 
intracellular markers for 25 min. For intranuclear γH2AX staining, cells were fixed/
permeablized in ice-cold 70% ethanol at -20°C for 2 hrs, blocked with 2% normal mouse 
serum (Sigma), Fc-block and 2% fetal calf serum for 15 min, followed by 45 min staining 
for γH2AX at room temperature. Stained cells were analyzed using BD FACSVerse and 
Fortessa X20 (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA) machines. Data analysis was performed using 
FlowJo 10 for Mac (TreeStar, OR, USA).
Antibodies were sourced from eBioscience unless otherwise stated. The following 
antibodies were used: anti-CD45 (30-F11), anti-B220 (RA3-6B2), anti-CD38 (90/CD38, 
BD), anti-CD138 (281-2, BD), anti-CD95 (Jo2), anti-GL7 (GL-7), anti-CD3 (145-2C11, 
Biolegend), anti-IgE (23G3), anti-IgG1 (M1-14D12), anti-IgG2a (R19-15, BD), anti-TCRβ 
(H57-597), anti-TCRγδ (eBioGL3), anti-Vγ5 (536), anti-Vγ4 (UC3-10Ab, Biolegend),

anti-IL-4 (11B11), anti-IL-6 (MP5-20F3, Biolegend), anti-CD63 (NVG-2, Biolegend) and 
γH2AX (JBW301, Millipore).
ELISA
For IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, NUNC Immune Maxisorp 96-well plates (Thermo 
Scientific) were coated with 5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgH+L (Southern Biotech) in borate 
buffered saline at 37°C for 3hr. After washing, plates were blocked with PBS containing 
0.5% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature, and appropriately diluted sera added and incubated 
overnight at 4°C. After washing, plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-
conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a (also detects IgG2c in C57BL/6 mice) 
(both Southern Biotech) for 5 hr at 4°C. Following further washing, the alkaline phosphatase 
substrate pNPP (Sigma) was added and absorbance measured at 405 nm. Total IgE was 
measured by an IgE capture method. Sera to be tested and IgE standard were added to plate 
wells coated with 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti-mouse IgE (PharMingen) and blocked with 
1% rat serum. Biotinylated rat monoclonal anti-mouse IgE (PharMingen) at 1 μg/ml were 
then added and incubated for 2h at 37°C. After washing in PBS 0.05% Tween, plates were 
incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Streptavidin (PharMingen) for 1 hr at 37°C. 
After washing, detection of antibody levels was carried out by addition of alkaline 
phosphatase substrate pNPP (Sigma) and absorbance measured at 405 nm.
For IgE ds-DNA autoreactivity, MaxiSorp plates were coated with 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal 
anti-mouse IgE (PharMingen) and blocked with 1% rat serum and 3% milk. Serum samples 
were screened at 1:25 dilution. 100 ng/ml biotinylated herring sperm ds-DNA (Promega) 
was then added and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing in PBS 0.05% Tween, plates

 were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Streptavidin (PharMingen) for 1 hr at 
37°C. After washing, detection was carried out by addition of alkaline phosphatase substrate 
pNPP (Sigma) and absorbance measured at 405 nm. Autoantibody levels were expressed in 
arbitrary ELISA units.
HEp-2 staining
Auto-reactivity of IgE was tested by indirect immunofluorescence using HEp-2 cells. Serum 
samples were diluted appropriately (tested in dilutions between neat – 1:25, depending on 
IgE titers) and incubated on HEp-2 slides (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4°C. After washing in PBS, 
slides were incubated with purified rat anti-mouse IgE (BD) for 2hrs, washed again and 
further incubated with anti-rat 555 secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) for 1hr at room 
temperature. As controls, serum from similarly treated IgE-deficient mice was also assessed 
as well as naïve wild-type serum. Slides were thoroughly washed and mounted with 
Vectashield containing DAPI (Vectashield) and visualised with a Leica DM4 fluorescence 
microscope (Leica).
Immunofluorescent staining of tumor samples
Tumors were removed from the back along with a small piece of adjacent skin and snap 
frozen in OCT on dry ice. 6 μm sections were cut using a Leica JUNG CM1800 cryostat and 
stored at -80ºC. For staining, slides were returned to room temperature before fixation with 
4% paraformaldhyde for 15min. Samples were then blocked in 5% goat serum for 1 hr at 
room temperature before staining with rat anti-mouse IgE (BD) overnight at 4°C. Following 
staining, samples were washed and incubated with alexa-fluor 555 conjugated, goat anti-rat 
IgE (ThermoFisher). After extensive washing, samples were mounted in VectaShield 
containing DAPI (Vectashield) and visualised with a Leica SP5 confocal laser-scanning 
microscope (Leica).
Epidermal sheets
Ears were collected, split into dorsal and ventral sides and floated dermis side-down in 0.5 
M NH4SCN for 40 minutes, 37°C, 5% v/v CO2. Subsequently, intact epidermal sheets were 
isolated and washed in PBS. They were then fixed in ice-cold acetone at -20°C for 15 
minutes, followed by rehydration in PBS. Non-specific binding to the epidermal tissue was 
blocked with 2% BSA for 1 hr and then 1:25 dilution of test sera was added and incubated 
overnight at 4°C. Any IgE binding to the tissue was visualized by first incubating with rat 
anti-mouse IgE (BD) followed by alexa-fluor 555 conjugated, goat anti-rat IgE both for 1 hr 
at room temperature. After extensive washing in PBS, samples were mounted in VectaShield 
containing DAPI (Vectashield) and visualised with a Leica SP5 confocal laser-scanning 
microscope (Leica).
Adoptive Transfer experiments
Whole CD4+ T cells were isolated from the spleens of donor wild-type and Il4-/- mice (using 
Miltenyi MACS isolation kits). For OTII transfer experiments, OTII Tg CD4+ T cells were 
cell sorted using OVA-peptide loaded tetramers (NIH, tetramer facility). 2x106 cells were

 intravenously injected, mice were rested for 24 hr and the dorsal ear skin then exposed to 
DMBA as described above.
BM chimeras
Wild-type, Tcrd-/- and Il4-/- mice were sub-lethally irradiated (750 rad) and immediately 
reconstituted with 5x106 donor BM cells by intravenous injection. Mice were left for 8 
weeks to fully reconstitute the haematopoietic cells, and then exposed to DMBA on the skin 
as described. Chimerism was assessed by FACS analysis of peripheral lymph nodes and skin 
tissue at the end of the experiments.
qRT-PCR and primer sequences
RNA was extracted from ammonium-fixed epidermis, or tumor tissue, preserved in RNA-
later, using an RNEasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water, and 
yield and purity were determined. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised from 
RNA with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 
cDNA was diluted in nuclease-free double-deionized water for qRT–PCR. All primers were 
single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (Sigma) that were intron-spanning as verified by 
NCBI Primer-Blast tool. Real-time PCR product was detected with SYBR Green (Life) 
measured continuously with a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA, 
USA). Ct values for genes of interest were normalized against Ct values of the housekeeping 
gene Cyclophilin (Cyc) using the 2-ΔCt method. The following primers were used: IgE: F 
(5’-CAAGTCAGCCAAGAACTTCAC-3’), R (5’-GACAGGTCGAACTAGGATAGTC-3’), 
IgG1: F (5’-TTGCATATGTACAGTCCCAG-3’), R (5’-
GTCAGAGTAATGGTGAGCAC-3’), IgM: F (5’-AAGACTGGAATAACAGGAAGGA-3’), 
R (5’-GTTTGTGCACCTCATTGGG-3’), Rae1: F (5’-
TGGACACTCACAAGACCAATG-3’), R (5’-CCCAGGTGGCACTAGGAGT-3’), IL-4: F 
(5’-CATCGGCATTTTGAACGAG-3’), R (5’-CGAGCTCACTCTCTGTGGTG-3’), IL-6: F 
(5’-TGATGGATGCTACCAAACTGG-3’), R (5’-TTCATGTACTCCAGGTAGCTATGG-3’), 
IL-33: F (5’-CACATTGAGCATCCAAGGAA-3’), R (5’-
AACAGATTGGTCATTGTATGTACTCAG-3’), Cyc: F (5’-
CAAATGCTGGACCAAACACAA-3’), R (5’-CCATCCAGCCATTCAGTCTTG-3’).
Immunoglobulin sequencing and analysis
Mice were treated twice with DMBA or TPA to the dorsal side of the ear skin, 3 days apart. 
One week after the last exposure, draining-LNs were collected and germinal center B cells 
(B220+CD95+GL7+) and plasma cells (FSChiCD95hiCD138+) cell sorted on a BD FACS 
Aria III (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA). RNA was extracted using RNEasy Micro kits (Qiagen) 
and reverse transcriped using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher). 
Sequences were amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NewEngland 
Biolabs) to ensure accuracy and robust performance for large PCR products. PCR with a 
primer in the constant Cε region 5’-CTAGGGTCATGGAAGCAGTGCC-3’ or Cγ1 region 
5’-GGGAAATAGCCCTTGACCAGG-3’ in combination with a promiscuous V region 
primer (binding all Vh genes) 5’-GAGGTGCAGCTGCAGGAGTCTGG-3’ was performed. 
All primers were labeled at either end with Multiplex Identifiers (MIDs) for multiplexing. 
PCR thermal cycling was as follows: 98°C, 30 sec; 30x (98°C, 30 sec; 60°C, 30 sec; 72°C,

 35 sec); and 72°C, 10min. Amplicons were purified by gel extraction using QIAquick PCR 
purification kit (Qiagen) and deep-sequenced by long-read 454 pyrosequencing on the 
Genome Sequencer FLX system (Roche). Raw sequencing data was presented in .FASTA 
format and unproductive sequences removed (data cleanup stages as described61).
Analysis was performed as previously described61. In short: sequences were assigned to 
individual samples according to their MID. V(D)J gene assignment of individual sequences 
were annotated using IMGT/HighV-Quest and the mouse database. Mean values of V(D)J 
gene usage were calculated before 3D bubble plots were created using the R package 
plot3D. Repertoire diversity was characterized using the Hill diversity index62, 63 and 
plotted using the Alakazam package17. Physiochemical properties of the CDRH3 region 
were calculated using the R package Peptides. Physiochemical properties included length, 
isoelectric point (pI), frequencies of amino acid classes in the CDRH3 region, and Kidera 
factors. Kidera factors are a set of 10 independent factors encapsulating information from 
~180 different measurable biophysical characteristics of the 20 amino acids18. Principal 
component analysis of Kidera factors was performed using the prcomp function in R using 
Minkowski distances as previously described64.
Human tissue
For FACS analysis, freshly excised SCC tissue and peripheral blood were obtained from 12 
patients during surgery at the Dermatology Department, University Hospital Southampton 
NHS Foundation Trust. Ethics were provided by the South Central Hampshire B NRES 
Committee (reference number 07/H0504/187). All participants recruited to the study 
provided informed consent for blood and tissue samples to be used for research purposes. 
All tumor tissue used in the study was confirmed SSCs with a diameter > 8mm. Non-
lesional skin was histopathologically normal and > 6mm away from the tumor edge. To 
obtain single cell suspension, tumor samples were cut into small pieces and enzymatically 
digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase I-A (Sigma) and 10 µg/ml DNAse I (Sigma) in RPMI 
medium at 37°C for 1.5 hours. The resulting suspension was passed through 70µm cell 
strainers and centrifuged in Optiprep (Axis-Shield). PBMCs were isolated from venous 
blood from the SCC patients by centrifugation with Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield). Single cell 
suspensions were stained for FACS against CD45 (2D1) and FcεR1 (MHE-18) (both 
BioLegend). Cells were gated on FSC and SSC and dead cells excluded using near IR live/
dead stain (Invitrogen).
For immunohistochemistry on human SSC tissue; 5µm tissue sections were cut from 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and placed onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane 
(APES)-coated microscope slides. Sections were deparaffinised in xylene and rehydrated 
through graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase was inhibited with 0.5% hydrogen 
peroxide, prior to antigen retrieval by microwaving in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6. 
Endogenous avidin and biotin were blocked (Vector Labs), before Dulbecco’s Modified 
Eagle’s Medium (Gibco) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 20% foetal 
bovine serum (Gibco) blocking medium was applied. Primary antibody (FcER1 (9E1), 1:20 
dilution (Abcam)) was then left on the sections for 16 hours at 4°C before 3 Tris buffered 
saline (TBS) washes, followed by application of biotinylated goat anti-mouse (1:400

 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 minutes. After 3 TBS washes, streptavidin-biotin 
complexes (Vector Labs) were applied, before being washed with TBS x 3 and application 
of diaminobenzidine (DAKO). After washing with TBS, sections were counterstained with 
Mayer’s Haematoxylin (Sigma) and dehydrated through graded alcohols and xylene. 
Sections were mounted in DPX mountant (Sigma) and coverslips applied. Slides were 
imaged at 2x and 20x magnification using an Olympus Dotslide microscope and analysed 
using OlyVIA software.
For SSC tumor gene expression, fixed frozen paraffin embedded skin samples from 56 
patients obtained from the University of Dundee, Tayside NHS Trust and Greater Glasgow 
and Clyde NHS Trust were analyzed. The study was conducted according to the Declaration 
of Helsinki Principles and all patients donating samples to this study provided written, 
informed consent in accordance with ethical approval from the East of Scotland Research 
Ethics Service (EoSRES) REC 1. SSC tumors were graded by an experienced 
dermatopathologist as low risk or high risk based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network for cutaneous SCC. In addition, peri-lesional skin (histopathologically normal 
looking skin > 4 mm away from the tumor edge) and abdominal non-UV exposed skin were 
also analyzed. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy extraction kit and directly 
hybridized using the NanoString PanCancer and PanCancer Immune expression panel and 
analyzed on a nCounter (NanoString).
Statistical evaluation
The statistical significance of difference between experimental groups was determined using 
two-tailed Student’s t-test for unpaired data, Wilcoxon test for paired samples, one-way 
ANOVA or linear regression, where appropriate, with results deemed significant at p<0.05. 
Stars of significance correlate to: *p<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001 and ****p<0.0001. 
Statistics was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.00 for Mac (GraphPad; La Jolla, CA, 
USA).
