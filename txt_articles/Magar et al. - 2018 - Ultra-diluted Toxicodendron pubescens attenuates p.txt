Despite the availability of multiple therapeutic agents, the search for novel pain management of 
neuropathic pain is still a challenge. Oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling are prominently 
involved in clinical manifestation of neuropathic pain. Toxicodendron pubescens, popularly known as 
Rhus Tox (RT) is recommended in alternative medicines as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic remedy. 
Earlier, we reported anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and immunomodulatory activities of Rhus Tox. In 
continuation, we evaluated antinociceptive efficacy of Rhus Tox in the neuropathic pain and delineated 
its underlying mechanism. Initially, in-vitro assay using LPS-mediated ROS-induced U-87 glioblastoma 
cells was performed to study the effect of Rhus Tox on reactive oxygen species (ROS), anti-oxidant 
status and cytokine profile. Rhus Tox decreased oxidative stress and cytokine release with restoration 
of anti-oxidant systems. Chronic treatment with Rhus Tox ultra dilutions for 14 days ameliorated 
neuropathic pain revealed as inhibition of cold, warm and mechanical allodynia along with improved 
motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) in constricted nerve. Rhus Tox decreased the oxidative and 
nitrosative stress by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) content, respectively along 
with up regulated glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity in sciatic nerve 
of rats. Notably, Rhus Tox treatment caused significant reductions in the levels of tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF-α
), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β
 (IL-1β
) as compared with CCI-control group. Protective 
effect of Rhus Tox against CCI-induced sciatic nerve injury in histopathology study was exhibited 
through maintenance of normal nerve architecture and inhibition of inflammatory changes. Overall, 
neuroprotective effect of Rhus Tox in CCI-induced neuropathic pain suggests the involvement of anti-
oxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
Neuropathic pain represents an important clinical condition and there is a continuous search for novel treat-
ments for treating neuropathy1. It is manifested as sensory abnormalities like dysesthesia (unpleasant sensation), 
hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to noxious stimuli), allodynia (increased sensitivity to non-noxious stimuli) 
and spontaneous development of pain2,3. Neuropathic pain has a complex pathology with distinct mechanisms. 
Global occurrences of neuropathic pain are escalating due to an increase in the ageing population, enhanced 
survival from cancer chemotherapy and progressively increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus1. Despite the 
emergence of novel drug discovery technologies and advancements in the field of neuroscience, the issue of neu-
ropathic pain management with safe and effective remedies is still unresolved4,5. Many randomized controlled 
trials have presented the clinical efficacy of opioids, gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake

inhibitors and calcium channel ligands in the treatment of neurogenic pain. However, these agents do not suffice 
the targets of managing of neuropathic pain. The efficacy of available anti-neuropathic drugs is limited due to 
occurrence of several side effects and inadequate or delayed pain relief4,6. The need to discover novel treatment 
modalities for neuropathic conditions still prevails.
Various factors contribute to the peripheral sensitization and initiation of neuropathic pain. Raised oxida-
tive stress, increased vascular permeability and release of different inflammatory mediators including substance 
P and calcitonin gene related peptide produced by nociceptive terminals, formation and/or release of brady-
kinin, prostaglandins, growth factors and cytokines leads to the occurrence of neuropathic pain7. Recently, the 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents like N-acetyl carnitine and alpha lipoic acid are being investigated as 
add-on medications for the management of neuropathic pain8.
Natural products or complementary and alternative medicines are frequently used to manage the chronic neu-
rological disorders like neuropathic pain4. Few preclinical studies on homeopathic remedies have also demon-
strated the efficacy of homeopathic remedies in the management of neuropathic pain9,10. Evidence based surveys 
have revealed that patients with chronic pain prefer to use herbal treatments for these painful conditions11,12. 
Several pre-clinical and clinical studies have reported the beneficial effect of medicinal plants in the therapy 
of painful neuropathy4,8,13–17. Toxicodendron pubescens P. Mill belonging to family anacardiaceae is known as 
Rhus toxicodendron or Rhus tox (RT) in alternative medicines18,19. RT is commonly used homeopathic remedy 
for the management of inflammatory conditions, rheumatic pain, typhoid type fever and mucous membrane 
affections20. Experimental studies have shown that RT possesses immunomodulatory21, anti-inflammatory19,22, 
anti-arthritic23,24 and anti-melanoma activity25. Recently, a prospective observational study in breast cancer 
patients has shown that RT may decrease joint pain and stiffness in women with early breast cancer26.
Surgical lesion of peripheral nerves in experimental animals are usually performed to produce the animal 
models resembling human neuropathic pain27. In this regard, chronic constriction injury (CCI) model appears to 
be well established and frequently used animal model for the study of neuropathic pain27,28. In this model, unilat-
eral loose ligation of sciatic nerve mimics the pathological neuropathic pain state in humans29. In this report, we 
demonstrated antinociceptive effects of RT in neuropathic pain using in-vitro and in-vivo assays. Initially, in-vitro 
study using U-87 primary glioblastoma cell line was executed to delineate the effect of RT on LPS-induced ROS 
production, anti-oxidant status and cytokine levels. Furthermore, in-vivo efficacy of RT was assessed in neu-
ropathic pain using well characterized animal model of sciatic nerve constriction injury-induced neuropathic 
pain in rats. Various behavioral testing paradigms (cold, warm and mechanical allodynia), physiological param-
eter (MNCV), biochemical estimations (MDA, NO, GSH, SOD, catalase, TNF-α
, IL-1β
, IL-6) and histopathol-
ogy was executed to explore the underlying analgesic mechanisms of RT in the experimental neuropathic pain. 
Gabapentin served as a positive control in this study.
Results
Effect of RT on LPS-induced oxidative stress in U-87 glioblastoma cells. 
The treatment of U-87 
cells with LPS resulted into a marked increase in the cell viability. Whereas, treatment of cell with RT at tested 
concentrations decreased LPS-mediated ROS induced cell viability in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A). There 
was no considerable cytotoxicity due to RT treatment in absence of LPS stimulation (data not shown). To overrule 
the interference of cytotoxicity of RT, we tested the concentrations of RT which were devoid of any prominent 
effect on the cell viability. Stimulation of cells with LPS has resulted into decreased levels of SOD and catalase 
activity in primary glioblastoma U-87 cells. But after addition of RT (1 ×

in LPS pre-treated cells offered a significant increase in SOD (***P < 0.001) and catalase activity (**P < 0.01) 
as compared to the LPS-treated control cells. RT exhibited dose dependent effect on these anti-oxidant systems 
(Fig. 1B,C). The level of ROS production in U-87 cells after LPS-stimulation was evaluated through flow cytomet-
ric analysis by DCFH-DA staining. Following LPS-stimulation, approximately 70% of U-87 cells were revealed 
as ROS positive. The significant (***p < 0.001) and concentration dependent decrease in ROS positive cells were 
observed after treatment of LPS-pre-treated cells with RT (1 ×

centage of ROS positive cells was found to be reduced in RT (1 ×

cells, respectively. The H2O2 was used as a positive control for ROS generation (Fig. 1D,K).
Effect of RT on LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in U-87 glioblastoma 
cells. 
To check the effect of RT on pro-inflammatory cytokines, the level of TNF-α
, IL-1β
, IL-6 and IL-10 
were measured in LPS pre-treated U-87 cells. Treatment of cells with LPS (500 ng/ml for 20 min) resulted into 
significant increase in the level of various cytokines as compared to untreated cells. As compared to LPS-control, 
the treatment of LPS-pre-treated cells with RT (1 ×

dose dependent and significant decrease in the levels of TNF-α
 (*P < 0.05), IL-1β
 (*P < 0.05), IL-6 (**P < 0.01) 
and IL-1β
 (**P < 0.01). Interestingly, the RT treatment almost brought down the cytokines level to basal level 
(Fig. 2A–D).
Effect of RT on cold, warm and mechanical allodynia in CCI-induced neuropathic pain. 
Effect of 
RT on cold, warm and mechanical allodynia in rats during CCI-induced neuropathic pain is depicted as Fig. 3A–C. 
 
Constriction of sciatic nerve in the animals caused a significant development of cold allodynia (Fig. 3A), warm 
allodynia (Fig. 3B) and mechanical allodynia (Fig. 3C) as compared with the sham operated group, evaluated 
through cold water test, warm water test and Von Frey hair test, respectively.
The paw withdrawal latency (PWL) with respect to cold allodynia was significantly decreased in CCI-control 
rats as compared with the sham operated rats (8.7 ± 1.1 sec Vs. 16 ± 0.4 sec, P < 0.001). RT (1 ×
 10−
12 dilu-
tion) significantly elevated the PWL as compared with the CCI-control animals (13 ± 0.3 sec Vs. 8.7 ± 1.1 sec; 
F (5, 20) = 5.641, P < 0.001). These effects were similar and less potent than gabapentin (60 mg/kg/day, p.o.).

Gabapentin increased the PWL in response to cold stimuli up to 19 ± 0.4 sec as compared with CCI control group 
16 ± 0.5 (P < 0.001) Fig. 3A. Effect of RT on warm allodynia following CCI surgery is represented as Fig. 3B. CCI 
induced a significant decrease in PWL (11 ± 0.3 sec) as compared with the sham operated group and normal 
group. RT treatment resulted in a significant elevation of PWL up to 14 ± 0.5 sec as compared to the CCI control 
group (P < 0.001) as shown in Fig. 3B.
We determined the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) using Von Frey hairs to assess the mechanical allodynia 
in rats. The PWT in CCI control rats (6.9 ± 0.7 g) was significantly lower as compared to the rats of sham group. 
RT and gabapentin treatments significantly increased the PWT as compared to the CCI-control rats as shown in 
Fig. 3C.
Effect of RT on MNCV in CCI-induced neuropathic pain in rats. 
The MNCV was estimated on the 14th 
day. CCI induced a significant reduction in the MNCV. As compared to the sham operated group having MNCV 
equal to 23.2 ± 3.8 mm/sec the CCI induced rats had MNCV of 15.9 ± 2.1 mm/sec (P < 0.001). RT and gabapentin 
treatments increased the MNCV up to 23.9 ± 2.07 and 25.3 ± 5.92 mm/sec respectively. However, these effects of 
RT and gabapentin were statistically non-significant (Fig. 4).
Effect of RT on oxidative stress in CCI-induced neuropathic pain. 
The extent of lipid peroxidation 
in the nerve homogenate measured as MDA was significantly higher in ligated sciatic nerve as compared with 
sham operated group (91 ± 18 Vs. 50 ± 6.6 μ
g/mg of protein; P < 0.001). Similarly, the nitric oxide level was sig-
nificantly elevated in CCI-control group as compared to the sham group (P < 0.001). CCI induced oxidative stress 
caused significantly reduced levels of GSH and inhibited the SOD and catalase activities in the nerve homogen-
ates as compared with the sham operated rats. Oral administration of RT for 14 days significantly attenuated the 
CCI-induced increase in MDA and NO levels. RT treatment also restored the levels of GSH and SOD activity. The 
restorative effect of RT on the catalase activity was not statistically significant. Gabapentin notably ameliorated 
the oxidative stress in CCI-induced rats. Moreover, the effects of RT in reducing the MDA and NO levels were 
comparable with the effects of the standard drug gabapentin (Table 1).

Effect of RT on pro-inflammatory cytokines in CCI-induced neuropathic pain. 
The CCI induced 
a notable rise in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The tissue levels of TNF-α
, IL-6 and IL-1β
 in the 
CCI-induced group were 56 ± 2.6, 44 ± 4.8 and 64 ± 6.8 pg/mg respectively. Whereas, in the sham operated 
group the levels of TNF-α
, IL-6 and IL-1β
 were 26 ± 0.4, 22 ± 0.3 and 22 ± 0.3 pg/mg. The CCI-induced group 
had significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the nerve tissue (P < 0.001). RT treatment for 
14 days remarkably decreased the levels of TNF-α
 to 25 ± 1.1 pg/mg, IL-6 to 20 ± 1.4 pg/mg and for IL-1β
 up to 
20 ± 1.4 pg/mg of protein (p < 0.001). These effects of RT on the pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar to the 
effects exerted by gabapentin (Fig. 5). RT exerted more prominent inhibitory effect on IL-1β
 levels as compared 
to the effect of gabapentin.
Effect of RT on CCI-induced histological alterations in the sciatic nerve. 
The CCI induced charac-
teristic histological changes in sciatic nerve. Alterations like nerve fibre swelling, inflammatory cell infilteration, 
fibre derangement and activation of neuroglial cell like satellite cells and Schwann cells suggest the damage of the 
sciatic nerve. Treatment of animals with RT or gabapentin protected the nerve from CCI-induced changes. The 
nerve samples from rats receiving these treatments revealed that both RT and gabapentin had reduced structural 
derangements, along with inhibition nerve fiber and neuroglial cell swelling (Fig. 6 and Table 2).
The longitudional sections of sciatic nerve of normal, sham, CCI-control, CCI + RT (1 ×
 1012; 0.1 ml/day, p.o.) 
treated and CCI + gabapentin (60 mg/kg, p.o) treated groups are shown as Fig. 6, respectively. Histopathology 
study of sections from normal rats demonstrated the normal architecture of sciatic nerve with no inflamma-
tory perturbations. Sections obtained from the sham operated rats also revealed normal structure with no 
marked changes. However, the CCI-control rats showed nerve fibre swelling, derangement of fibre architecture, 
inflammatory cell infiltration along with alterations in satellite cells and schwann cells (Table 2). Treatment 
with RT (1 ×
 10−
12; 0.1 ml/day, p.o.) or gabapentin (60 mg/kg/day, p.o.) exibited ameliorative effect against 
the CCI-induced changes in the sciatic nerve of rats as evident by reduction in inflammatory alterations and 
structural derangement (Magnification 100×
, scale bar, 1000 µm).
Discussion
CCI-induced neuropathic pain in rats represents characteristic painful behaviors like hyperalgesia and allodynia, 
thus validating its suitability for the evaluation of anti-neuropathic drugs29–31. In this model, the neuropathic pain 
is caused by a primary lesion and dysfunction of the somatosensory nervous system3,14. RT ultra-dilutions have 
been consistently proved to possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory22 and immunomodulatory21 activities in the

experimental models. We investigated the effects of RT using in vitro model of LPS-induced oxidative stress and 
cytokine release from the U-87 glioblastoma cell culture to determine the exact ultra-dilution which inhibits the 
induced oxidative stress. The ultra-dilution that was found to be the most effective in reducing oxidative stress in 
nerve cells was then tested for the anti-neuropathic efficacy against CCI-induced pain.
The efficacy of RT to inhibit LPS-induced oxidative stress in the U-87 cells was evident in our study. RT

15 dilutions reduced the percentage of ROS positive cells and also decreased the expression 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α
, IL-1β
, IL-6 and IL-10) along with decrease in the levels of SOD and cat-
alase. These finding signify the in-vitro potential of RT ultra-dilutions to protect the neuronal cells from induced 
oxidative stress. Dos Santos et al.19 has reported that the anti-inflammatory activity of RT is maximum when 
its homeopathic dilution corresponding to 1 ×
 10−
12 dilution was tested against the carrageenan-induced paw 
edema in rats. Similar pattern of maximal efficacy was found in our earlier studies on RT where we evaluated its 
anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-arthritic effect21–24. The present in vitro findings indicating the 
effectiveness of RT in reducing the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine release are in congruence with 
these reports.

Across the 14 days post CCI surgery, the rats exhibited characteristic behavioural symptoms of neuropathic 
pain similar to the clinical symptoms. The paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) 
against mechanical and thermal stimuli were used for determination of the neuropathic pain. RT treatment effec-
tively elevated these pain thresholds indicating the reduced neuropathic pain sensations. In line with the pub-
lished data indicating the anti-inflammatory22 and analgesic26 activities, our study proves that RT also effectively 
reduces the neuropathic pain.

The CCI induces ischemic hypoxic imbalance in the secondary metabolites in affected nerve fibres and pro-
duces oxidative stress32,33. Degeneration of nerve fibre and decreased nerve energy is reported to reduce the 
MNCV. RT ameliorated the nerve damage mediated reduction in the MNCV following CCI in sciatic nerve 
indicating its neuroprotective effect. Oxidative stress and inflammation are interconnected events leading to 
nerve injury and persistent pain34,35. Various plant extracts, their isolated fractions or phytoconstituents have 
been reported to exert their anti-neuropathic activity through the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant mecha-
nisms35–40. The concentrations of MDA and NO are commonly measured to study the extent of reactive oxygen 
species34. ROS like superoxide, NO and peroxynitrite have an important role in the development of neuroinflam-
matory responses41. Increase in lipid peroxidation following CCI of sciatic nerve has also been reported41. Efficacy 
of free radical scavengers towards the reduction of lipid peroxidation suggests the involvement of ROS in the 
nerve sensitization and production of allodynia42.
NO is the vital signaling molecule which has significant role in the peripheral and central pain43. Involvement 
of endogenous nitric oxide in the development of CCI-induced neuropathic pain is well documented in earlier 
studies44. Significant rise in the levels of NO in sciatic nerve suggested the up regulation of NO and its role in 
the production and maintenance of neuropathic pain44,45. In the present study significant increase in the levels 
of MDA and NO were observed in the chronically constricted nerve. It denotes elevated damage to the macro-
molecules such as proteins and lipids which may result into the neuropathic pain. Chronic administration of RT 
resulted in the decreased levels of MDA and NO indicating the anti-lipid peroxidation activity along with inhibi-
tion of nitrosative tissue damage and successive neuropathic pain.
Our findings are in line with previous studies reporting the decline in GSH content of sciatic nerve following 
CCI in rats46. Catalase and SOD are main anti-oxidant enzymes that help to scavenge the free radicals and offer 
protection against oxidative stress46,47. In our study, decrease in the level of catalase and SOD after CCI in the rats 
are indicative of increased oxidative stress or declined anti-oxidant defense mechanisms. These results are in tune 
with earlier reports and reinforce the contribution of oxidative stress in the development of neuropathic pain47–49. 
Oxidative stress mediated decline in the levels of GSH, SOD and catalase were restored in the CCI rats by chronic 
treatment with RT ultra-dilution (1 ×
 10−
12). Thus, RT mediated decrease in the CCI-induced oxidative stress 
could be one of the mechanisms involved its antinociceptive activity in neuropathic pain.
Different cytokines including TNF-α
 IL-1β
, and IL-6 are released following the nerve injury and contribute 
to the development of neuropathic pain34. Peripheral nerve damage induces release of TNF-α
 rapidly from mac-
rophages, Schwann cells and mast cells26,50. TNF-α
 is associated with decline in pain threshold and anti-TNF-α
 
treatments are reported to alleviate the CCI-induced pain in rats51. In this study, we observed a significant 
decrease in the TNF-α
 level in sciatic nerve in the group treated with RT as compared with CCI-control group. 
This finding revealed that RT modulated the neuro-inflammation in peripheral nerve through its anti-TNF-α
 
action and it could be one of its anti-nociceptive mechanisms. IL-1β
 is known to be expressed in nociceptive 
neurons and it has important role in several pain models52,53. The IL-1β
 increases the neuropathic pain sensitiza-
tion through its action on the adjacent neurons34. We observed a significant increase in the production of IL-1β
 
in sciatic nerve after CCI in rats. Treatment of animals with RT inhibited IL-1β
 production which may account 
for its antinociceptive effect. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine having important role in the development of 
inflammatory and neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Results of present study revealed that 
RT has ability to decrease the IL-6 level which signifies the anti-IL-6 effect of RT in CCI-induced neuropathic 
pain model. Overall findings through biochemical estimation denote that RT favorably altered the cytokine pro-
file in the experimental model of neuropathic pain.
In summary, this study substantiated the antinociceptive potential of RT ultra-dilutions in the validated model 
of CCI-induced peripheral neuropathic pain. Interestingly, RT was found to be efficacious in reducing not only 
the thermal nociception but also the mechanical allodynia in rats. RT demonstrated notable anti-oxidant and 
anti-inflammatory effects in the sciatic nerve and exhibited potential free radical scavenging activity that would 
reduce its anti-neuropathic activity. Attenuated oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways may contribute to 
the therapeutic potential of RT in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Although, the results of present study sug-
gested the anti-neuropathic effect of RT, further pre-clinical and clinical studies are warranted to confirm these 
effects. Several other biochemical mechanisms may be involved in RT mediated anti-neuropathic effect. Results 
of present study are suggestive of the anti-nociceptive effect of RT against neuropathic pain and deserve further 
validation of its effectiveness in various painful conditions.

MTT cell viability assay. 
The cytotoxicity study of RT in LPS mediated ROS-induced U-87 cells was per-
formed using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl-)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] viability assay as described 
earlier5,35. Approximately, 1 ×
 104 cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to 
reach 80% confluence. The U-87 cells were treated with 500 ng/ml of LPS for 20 minutes to induce ROS. The LPS 
containing media was replaced with fresh media and the cells were treated with different concentrations of RT 
(1 ×
 10−
2–1 ×
 10−
36) for further 24 h. Then, MTT solutions (0.05 μ
g/μ
l) diluted in PBS was added to each well. 
The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow the formation of purple formazan crystals. Thereafter, 
detergent solution was added to each well to solubilise the crystals and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The intensity 
of formed color after dissolving the formazan crystals in DMSO was measured spectrophotometrically using a 
microplate reader (Berthold Technologies, Germany) at 570 nm. Each data point was performed in triplicate and 
all assays were executed thrice. The data were represented as the percent (%) viability against control.
Cell culture and treatment. 
The human glioblastoma cell line U-87 was maintained in Dulbecco’s mod-
ified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μ
g/ml 
of streptomycin, 1.5 mM of L-Glutamine in the humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The U-87 cells were 
cultured in the culture flasks (75 cm2) and medium was changed at every alternate day. After 80% confluence, the 
media was replaced with fresh media containing LPS (500 ng/mL) for 20 min to induce the production of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS). Various concentrations of RT were added in LPS pre-treated cells for another 24 h prior to 
perform the next experiments. The concentration of ethanol in the final assay medium was less than 0.1%. The 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at the fixed concentration (10 μ
M) was treated for 30 min to produce ROS and used 
as positive control.
Determination of ROS, SOD, catalase activity and cytokines in U-87 cells. 
LPS pre-treated 
(500 ng/ml for 20 min) U-87 cells were treated with different concentrations of RT before the estimation of ROS. 
Flow cytometry analysis of ROS production by 2′
-7′
-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining 
were performed using flow cytometer (FACS Canto II, Becton & Dickinson, CA, USA) as described earlier by 
Eruslanov and Kusmartsev37 with some modifications. The H2O2 was used as positive control for the generation 
of ROS. The concentration of SOD and catalase level in LPS-pretreated U-87 cells were measured using earlier 
reported methods38,39. The quantification of cytokines including TNF- α
, IL-1β
, IL-6, IL-10 in LPS-pretreated 
U-87 cells were executed in cell culture supernatants using 50 μ
g of protein by the commercially obtained ELISA 
kits as per the manufacturer’s instructions5,38.
Animals. 
Adult albino Wistar rats of either sex (170–220 g) were used for the present study. Animals were 
obtained from animal house facility of R. C. Patel Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Shirpur. 
Animals were maintained in ventilated polypropylene cages under the standard conditions (25 ± 2 °C, 12 h 
light/ dark cycle) at the animal house facility of the institute. Animals were fed with standard pelletized feed 
(Nutrimix Std-1020) obtained from Nutrivet Life Sciences, Pune, India and water was provided ad libitum exclud-
ing the period of behavioral parameter evaluation. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical 
Committee (Approval No. IAEC/RCPIPER/2016-17/02) of the R. C. Patel Institute of Pharmaceutical Education

and Research, Shirpur, India (Reg. No. 651/PO/ReBi/S/02/CPCSEA). All the experimental procedures involving 
the use of animals were carried out in accordance with the regulations laid down by Committee for the Purpose of 
Control and Supervision of Experimentation on animals (CPCSEA) constituted under the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals Act, 1960, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India.
Induction of chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats. 
The surgery was performed to induce the CCI as 
described earlier by Chanchal et al.5. Briefly, the animals were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal administration 
of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg). A blunt dissection through biceps femoris was executed to expose the com-
mon sciatic nerve of right hind limb at the middle of the thigh. Approximately, 5–7 mm of the nerve was freed 
off the adhering tissue proximal to the trifurcation of sciatic nerve and four ligatures (6.0 silk) were loosely tied 
around it about 1 mm apart. Following nerve ligation, the muscular and skin layers were instantly sutured and 
povidone-iodine solution was applied externally. The rats were kept in individual cages and allowed to recover29. 
The respective drug treatments were started on the next day after the surgery.
Drug treatment and groups. 
Animals were randomly divided into five groups, each consisting of 8 
rats (n = 8). Group I: Normal control group of rats were orally administered once daily with 1 ml saline for 14 
days. Group II: Sham operated group of rats were treated with 1 ml saline once daily for 14 days. Group III: 
CCI-induced neuropathy control group of rats orally received 1 ml saline once daily for 14 days. Group IV: 
CCI-induced neuropathy + RT treated group of rats orally received 0.1 ml of RT (1 ×
 10−
12 dilution) with 1 ml 
of distilled water once daily for 14 days. Group V: CCI-induced neuropathy + gabapentin treated group of rats 
orally received Gabapentin (60 mg/kg/day, p.o.) suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) once daily 
for 14 days.
Experimental design. 
Subsequent to the induction of CCI, rats were habituated for 3 days. RT treatment 
was started on the next day after the CCI surgery. The thermal and mechanical allodynia were measured on 
Day-3, Day-7, Day-11 and Day-14 following the surgery by earlier reported methods5,40. Paw withdrawal latency 
(PWL) was recorded with the maximum cut off time of 20 sec. Right hind paw of each rat up to the ankle joint was 
immersed in warm water (40 ± 1 °C) and cold water (12 ± 1 °C) for the determination of thermal (warm and cold) 
allodynia. Mechanical allodynia was noted using electronic Von-Frey apparatus comprising of super-tip probes 
(2390 series, IITC Life Sciences Incorporation). Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was recorded with cut-off pres-
sure of 30 gm. Rats were kept in polypropylene cages with metal mesh floor and acclimatized for approximately 
10 min before the measurements. Mid-plantar surface of operated hind paw were probed with Von Frey filaments 
through the mesh floor, when the paw was in contact with floor. Each filament was applied to the planter surface 
until it just bent and kept in position for about 6–8 sec. Probes were applied in ascending order and the smallest 
filament which provoked paw withdrawal response was measured as threshold stimulus55.
On the 14th day after surgery, the animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital 
sodium (60 mg/kg). The body temperature of animal was maintained at 37 °C. Sciatic-tibial motor nerve con-
duction velocity (MNCV) was measured by the stimulation of sciatic and tibial nerves at the sciatic notch and 
tibial notch through the bipolar needle electrodes (Power Lab/ML856; AD Instruments, Australia) at the 0.10 Hz 
frequency, 0.1 ms duration and 1.5 V amplitude. After single stimulus the compound muscle action potential 
was measured from the first interosseous muscle of the hind-paw by unipolar pin electrodes. The recording was 
typical biphasic response with an initial M-wave which is a direct motor response owing to stimulation of motor 
fibers. The MNCV was calculated as the ratio of the distance (mm) between both sites of stimulation divided by 
the difference between proximal and distal latencies recorded in ms32,56.
Following the recording of MNCV, the rats were sacrificed using overdose of pentobarbital sodium. The 
injured sciatic nerve was isolated along with 1 cm segments on the both sides of CCI injury. The central 5 mm 
portion of the isolated nerve segment was processed for histological examination. The sections of 4 μ
m thickness 
were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The stained sections were examined under the light microscope for 
structural alterations including fiber derangement, swelling of nerve fiber and presence of activated satellite cells 
and Schwann cells. Paraformaldehyde-fixed nerve tissues were dehydrated in ascending graded series of alcohol 
and embedded in paraffin. The specimens were cut into the sections of 4 μ
m thickness using microtome and 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to routine staining protocols. The stained sections were examined 
under the light microscope (Leica D1000, LED) for structural alterations like nerve fiber swelling, fiber derange-
ment and presence of activated satellite cells and Schwann cells13,57.
Segments of sciatic nerve from the rats were process in ice chilled phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to obtain the 10% 
homogenate. Homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min at 4 °C and aliquots were used for the determina-
tion of malondialdehyde (MDA)58, reduced glutathione (GSH)59, superoxide dismutase (SOD)38 and catalase39,60.
Nitric oxide (NO) was estimated using earlier reported method by Kumar et al.41 with some modifications. 
Briefly, 50 μ
l of tissue supernatant was mixed with 500 μ
l of Griess reagent and the absorbance was determined 
spectrophotometrically at 540 nm using Powerwave XS microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek, USA). Calibration 
curve was obtained by using Sodium nitrite as a standard. The concentration of NO was expressed in μ
M of NO 
per mg of protein.
The quantification of cytokines like TNF- α
, IL-1β
 and IL-6 was determined in homogenate and using 50 μ
g of 
protein by the commercially obtained ELISA kits as per the manufacturer’s instructions5,38.
