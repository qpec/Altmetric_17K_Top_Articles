ABSTRACT
The Ixodes scapularis tick transmits a number of pathogens, including
tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs). In the United States, confirmed human infections with
the Powassan virus (POWV) TBFV have a fatality rate of �10% and are increasing in
incidence. Tick salivary glands (SGs) serve as an organ barrier to TBFV transmission,
and little is known regarding the location of TBFV infection in SGs from fed ticks.
Previous studies showed I. scapularis vanin (VNN) involved with TBFV infection of I.
scapularis ISE6 embryonic cells, suggesting a potential role for this gene. The overall
goal of this study was to use SG cultures to compare data on TBFV biology in SGs
from fully engorged, replete (fed) ticks and from unfed ticks. TBFV multiplication was
higher in SGs from fed ticks than in those from unfed ticks. Virus-like particles were
observed only in granular acini of SGs from unfed ticks. The location of TBFV infec-
tion of SGs from fed ticks was observed in cells lining lobular ducts and trachea but
not observed in acini. Transcript knockdown of VNN decreased POWV multiplication
in infected SG cultures from both fed and unfed ticks. This work was the first to
identify localization of TBFV multiplication in SG cultures from a fed tick and a tick
transcript important for POWV multiplication in the tick SG, an organ critical for
TBFV transmission. This research exemplifies the use of SG cultures in deciphering
TBFV biology in the tick and as a translational tool for screening and identifying po-
tential tick genes as potential countermeasure targets.
IMPORTANCE Tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs) are responsible for more than 15,000
human disease cases each year, and Powassan virus lineage 2 (POWV-L2) deer tick
virus has been a reemerging threat in North America over the past 20 years. Rapid
transmission of TBFVs in particular emphasizes the importance of preventing tick
bites, the difficulty in developing countermeasures to prevent transmission, and
the importance of understanding TBFV infection in tick salivary glands (SGs). Tick
blood feeding is responsible for phenomenal physiological changes and is asso-
ciated with changes in TBFV multiplication within the tick and in SGs. Using SG
cultures from Ixodes scapularis female ticks, the primary aims of this study were
to identify cellular localization of virus-like particles in acini of infected SGs from
fed and unfed ticks, localization of TBFV infection in infected SGs from fed ticks,
and a tick transcript (with associated metabolic function) involved in POWV-L2
infection in SG cultures.

ector-borne illnesses have increased since 2004 in the United States, and cases of
tick-borne disease have more than doubled in the last 13 years (1). Powassan virus
(POWV) is the only endemic tick-borne flavivirus (TBFV) in North America, and cases of
POWV infection have been on the increase in the United States since 1999 (2–6). The
cases have been identified in the upper Midwest and upper East Coast states of the
United States. POWV infections can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. The latter may
be associated with severe neurological disease, including meningoencephalitis, and
with a case fatality rate of approximately 10%. Additionally, long-term neurological
sequelae may arise (7, 8).
There are currently two genetic lineages of POWV: lineage 1 (POWV-L1) and lineage
2 (deer tick virus; POWV-L2). The lineages are suggested to have different ecological life
cycles, including different tick vectors, mammalian hosts, and habitats (6, 8). POWV-L1
has been isolated from Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ixodes spinipalpis, Ixodes marxi, and
Ixodes cookei (8–14). POWV-L2 has been isolated from the black-legged tick, Ixodes
scapularis (15–21) and the Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor andersoni (20, 22).
Similarly to other tick-borne viruses (TBVs), POWV can be transmitted to a mammal host
from an infected tick in as little as 15 min (15, 23). Other TBFVs have been identified in
tick saliva and in the cement cone created during attachment and feeding (24, 25).
These observations suggest that infectious virus is present in salivary glands (SGs) prior
to feeding and can thus be transmitted in the early stage of feeding. Thus, salivary
gland-TBFV (SG-TBFV) interactions, SG saliva production, and TBFV secretion are of key
importance in understanding mechanisms of TBFV transmission.
The SG of the female ixodid tick is made up of a series of ramifying lobular ducts
with three types of acini. Tracheal ducts branch into tracheoles that infiltrate tissues,
including those of SGs, and are involved in respiration (26). The type 1 acini are
agranular and nonsecretory in nature; they are implicated in osmoregulation and ion
uptake. The type 2 and 3 acini are granular and secretory in nature; they are involved
in production and secretion of saliva (27–29). The type 2 acinus is composed of cell
types a, b, and c, whereas the type 3 acinus has cell types d, e, and f (30, 31). Type a
cells have been implicated in release of secretory granules (29) and of molecules
associated with the cement cone (30, 32) in response to blood feeding. Type b cells
have been linked with secretory activity (29) and secretion of glycoproteins (30, 32).
Type d cells have been associated with release of secretory granules (29). Both type d
and type e cells are thought to contribute to the formation of the cement cone (30, 33).
There are three stages in blood feeding; the feeding lesion is formed during the
preliminary phase (24 to 36 h), the slow-feeding phase occurs between days 5 and 10,
and the final rapid feeding phase occurs between h 12 and h 24 (34–36). During
feeding, the SGs undergo marked changes. These include increased protein synthesis
as well as induction of apoptotic and autophagic responses (30, 37). In addition, the size
of the type 2 and 3 acini increases in comparison to that of type 1 acini during tick
blood feeding (29). Because the transmission of TBFVs occurs in the first feeding phase,
identification of the specific cell types that are targets for TBFV infection, especially
within acini types 2 and 3, may pinpoint how TBFVs are shed into saliva.
Ticks infected during blood feeding develop higher levels of virus both in the whole
ticks and in SGs (25, 38–40). Booth et al. identified Thogoto virus (THOV; a member of
the Orthomyxoviridae family) antigen in the lumen of granular acini (type 2/3) and
basement membranes of all three acini types (40). This suggests that all three acini
types may be susceptible to TBV infection. Grabowski et al. observed antigens of Langat
virus (LGTV), a model TBFV, and POWV-L1 in granular acini and in lobular ducts of
infected SG cultures from unfed I. scapularis female ticks (41). However, the precise
cellular localization of viral antigen and virions was not determined. Furthermore, the
cell types that are susceptible to TBFV infection in SGs from fed I. scapularis female ticks
remain unknown.
Given the crucial role of SG biology in TBFV transmission, another important issue
is defining changes in the tick transcriptome and proteome following TBFV infection of
SGs. Identifying key changes in cellular pathways may suggest targets for possible

 countermeasures. Although data on SG transcripts associated with LGTV infection of
whole nymphal I. scapularis ticks have been published previously (42, 43), it is not
known if the same transcripts are implicated in adult SGs. Additionally, another study
functionally associated a small subset of transcripts in I. scapularis ISE6 cells with LGTV
infection (44). Specifically, transcript knockdown of predicted I. scapularis carbon-
nitrogen hydrolase/pantetheine hydrolase/vanin-like, or vanin (VNN), reduced LGTV
genome replication and infectious multiplication. It is important to know if transcript
knockdown of VNN would reduce POWV infection in tick SG organ cultures.
The overall goals of this study were to compare TBFV biology in SGs from fed ticks
to that in SGs from unfed ticks and to further evaluate the useful application of SG
cultures in defining possible targets for countermeasure development. Utilizing SG
cultures, the aims of this study were as follows: (i) to compare results corresponding to
SG viability, TBFV multiplication, and size of granular acini from fed versus unfed female
I. scapularis ticks; (ii) to utilize green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged LGTV (LGTVGFP)
to identify locations of TBFV multiplication in SGs from fed ticks; (iii) to identify cellular
localization of virus-like particles (VLPs), or virions, in cell types of TBFV-infected SG acini
from fed and unfed ticks; and (iv) to observe effects of VNN transcript knockdown on
multiplication of pathogenic POWV in SG cultures from fed and unfed ticks.
RESULTS
Viability and TBFV multiplication in SG cultures from fed and unfed ticks. The
studies undertaken required a careful determination of the viability of short-term SG
cultures from both fully engorged, replete (fed) I. scapularis ticks and unfed I. scapularis
ticks (41, 45). Thus, we compared the levels of metabolic activity of cultures from fed
and unfed ticks. SGs from fed ticks exhibited greater metabolic activity 24 to 72 h
postculture (hpc) than SGs from unfed ticks. This may have been due in part to the size
difference between SGs from fed ticks and SGs from unfed ticks. SG cultures from unfed
ticks are metabolically viable longer (for up to 264 hpc [41]) than SGs from fed ticks (168
to 192 hpc) (Fig. 1). Thus, we decided to use 180 h as the final time point in this study.
We next compared levels of multiplication of the following three TBFVs in the
culture model: LGTV, POWV-L1, and POWV-L2. All three replicated in SG cultures from
fed and unfed ticks. Multiplication of all three was greater in cultures from fed ticks than
in cultures from unfed ticks (Fig. 2). Interestingly, POWV-L2 replicated to higher levels
than POWV-L1. Thus, each of the examined TBFVs was able to replicate in SG cultures
from both fed and unfed ticks.
Morphology of acini from mock-infected and infected SG cultures from fed and
unfed ticks. To compare the structures of acini from SG cultures from fed and unfed
ticks, we utilized high-resolution light microscopy. Examination of semithin sections

 (Fig. 3) confirmed that the SG cultures maintained the basic morphology found in vivo
ixodid ticks (29, 46). The SG cultures from the unfed ticks provided similar structures
with respect to the specific cell types and features found within granular acini of ixodid
female ticks (29, 46). Depending on how the sections were cut, lumen of acini and
lobular ducts were observed. In addition, the semithin sections also confirmed that SG
cultures of the fed ticks had and maintained larger degranulated, granular acini
(associated with the blood feeding process and apoptotic events [29]) than the granular
acini of the unfed tick. Degranulated acini (type 2 and/or 3) were obvious in mock- and
LGTV-infected SG cultures from fed ticks (Fig. 3); the diameters were much larger than
those seen with the granulated acini of SGs from unfed ticks (Fig. 3 and 4). There was
no obvious difference between the mock- and LGTV-infected acini from fed and unfed
ticks. This analysis confirmed that the structures of granular acini from SG cultures from
fed and unfed ticks were similar to those of SGs from fed and unfed whole ticks and
that infection did not obviously affect acini structure.
Localization of LGTV infection in SG cultures from fed and unfed ticks. TBFV
replicated in SG cultures from both fed and unfed female I. scapularis ticks (Fig. 2).
However, the location of TBFV infection in SGs of fed ticks is unknown. To determine
this, we infected cultures from both fed and unfed ticks with LGTVGFP and compared
the cultures for determination of the location of the GFP signal by confocal imaging
(Fig. 5; see also Movie S1 to S6). We considered the site of the GFP signal to represent
the location of virus multiplication. As reported previously (41), autofluorescence was
noted in the main lobular duct in SGs from both fed and unfed ticks (Fig. 5B and D; see
FIG 2 Infectious TBFV multiplication in SG cultures from fed (bf) and unfed (uf) ticks. (A) Quantitation
of infectious virus multiplication with immunofocus assays was performed on supernatants collected
from wells with one LGTV-infected SG pair from fed (gray box) and unfed (white box) ticks at 3, 108, and
180 h postinfection (hpi). The red dotted line denotes the initial inoculum of 5 � 105 focus-forming units
(FFU) used for infections. Error bars represent means and ranges, and data are representative of results
from two technical replicates of each sample for the immunofocus assays. (B) Subsequently, detection of
infectious virus production with immunofocus assays was completed with supernatants collected from
wells with POWV-L1- or POWV-L2-infected SG pairs from fed (gray box) and unfed (white box) ticks at 180
hpi. The red dotted line denotes the level measured in a control well without SGs (initial inoculum) that
was collected at 3 hpi. “POWV-L1”denotes Powassan virus lineage I (LB strain), and “POWV-L2”denotes

assays performed with 2 to 3 biological replicates.

 also Movie S2 and S4) and in small puncta within degranulated acini of fed ticks (Fig. 5B;
see also Movie S2). No GFP signal was observed within degranulated acini in SGs from
fed ticks (Fig. 5A; see also Movie S1). However, GFP expression was consistently seen in
cells lining multiple tracheal and lobular ducts (Fig. 5A; see also Movie S1 and S5)
throughout the SG. The tracheal ducts, involved in respiration, are not part of the SG
apparatus but are often found intertwined with SGs (27, 47). The GFP expression
around these ducts was often noted in areas where acini were attached. Taken
together, these GFP results confirmed that SG cultures from fed ticks can support LGTV
multiplication.
GFP expression of LGTVGFP also was observed in granular acini and cells lining the
lobular duct of SGs from unfed ticks (Fig. 5C and F; see also Movie S3 and S6). However,
GFP expression in the cells lining the lobular ducts was not as extensive as that seen in
fed ticks. Specifically, GFP expression was detected in type 2 acini and in apical
epithelial cells of type 3 acini (Fig. 5F). LGTVGFP was not apparent in acini of SGs of fed
ticks but was evident in acini of SGs from unfed ticks. This further suggested that the
acini harboring LGTVGFP infection were granular (type 2 and/or 3) in nature since these
types of acini are degranulated in fully engorged, replete ixodid ticks.
Finally, we examined thin sections prepared from SG cultures by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) imaging to identify VLPs. No structures resembling VLPs in
size or appearance were observed in mock-infected SG cultures from fed or unfed ticks.
VLPs consistent with flavivirus particles were identified in LGTV-infected SGs from unfed

 ticks; they were mostly within single-membrane bound vacuoles (Fig. 6; see also Fig. S1
in the supplemental material) but were also noted in a double-membraned vacuole
(Fig. 6A and B) as well as in the lumen of granulated acini (Fig. 6G and H; see also
Fig. S1). Since no VLPs were observed in mock-infected SG cultures, we concluded that
they represented virions in LGTV-infected SGs. The extensive degranulation of granular
acini of SGs from fed ticks precluded clear identification of virions from these cultures
(Fig. S2). Nevertheless, our TEM analysis provided evidence of virion localization in
granular acini of LGTV-infected SGs from unfed I. scapularis ticks.
The role of vanin in POWV-L2 multiplication in SG cultures. To identify whether
I. scapularis vanin (VNN) transcript was involved in POWV-L2 infection of SGs in different
physiological states, the effect on infectious POWV-L2 multiplication following VNN
transcript knockdown was assessed. First, VNN transcript expression in SGs from fed and
unfed tick was identified via two-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with pooled
SGs. We observed amplification of VNN transcript in SGs from both fed and unfed ticks
(Fig. S3) as previously observed in I. scapularis ISE6 cells (44). Next, double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA) corresponding to VNN was created and transfected in POWV-L2-infected
SG cultures to determine the effect on infectious virus multiplication. Transfection of
10 ng of VNN dsRNA in SG cultures from both fed and unfed ticks at 108 h postinfection
(hpi) yielded relative reductions of VNN transcript levels by 70% and 50%, respectively
(Fig. 7A and B). Additionally, these transfection conditions did not decrease the
metabolic viability of the SGs in culture, but viability did increase in SG cultures from
fed ticks (Fig. 7C and D). In completing these VNN dsRNA transfections in POWV-L2-
infected SG cultures, a (100.5-fold to 101.5-fold) reduction in infectious POWV-L2 mul-

 tiplication was observed in SGs from both fed and unfed ticks, respectively (Fig. 8A and
B; see also Fig. S4). These transcript knockdown experiments suggested that VNN may
indeed be implicated in pathogenic TBFV infection of SG tissue.

multiplication. Furthermore, we compared levels of virus infection in SG cultures from
fed and unfed adult female ticks, representing two vastly different physiological states.

 LGTV and both lineages of POWV replicated well in cultures from both fed and
unfed ticks. Virus production was greater in the cultures from fed ticks (Fig. 2), a finding
that mirrored results from infected whole ticks (25, 38–40). POWV-L2 (deer tick virus)
replicated to higher levels than POWV-L1 (Fig. 2B). This may be suggestive of the
possibility that the two lineages of POWV may multiply differently in I. scapularis and
that the results may reflect differences in transmission efficiency. This is an interesting
observation since I. scapularis is considered a natural vector for POWV-L2 (8, 16–21),
whereas other ixodid tick species (H. longicornis, I. spinipalpis, I. cookei, and I. marxi) are
implicated in maintenance of POWV-L1 (8–14). POWV-L2 has been found in natural
populations of D. andersoni (20, 22), but the natural transmission cycle of POWV with
this tick species remains unclear. Further studies are required in order to compare the
levels of growth of TBFV (LGTV and both POWV lineages, including multiple isolates/
strains of each) in SG cultures from multiple tick species and in whole ticks of different
species to determine if there are definable biological differences. This would help
address potential transmission barriers of POWV in the multiple tick species (of the
genera Ixodes, Dermacentor, Amblyomma, and Haemaphysalis) that are found in North
America.
We used several methods to localize virus multiplication and virus in SG cultures. In
the cultures from unfed ticks, viral gene expression was localized to cells lining lobular
ducts and cells found in granular acini type 2 or 3 (Fig. 5C and F; see also Movie S3 and
S6 in the supplemental material). These cells are involved with secretory activity in SGs,
and virus in these cells would be available for rapid release into the saliva. This
observation may be relevant since virus can be transmitted as soon as 15 min after
initiation of feeding (15, 23). As noted in Results, both types of granular acini contain
several different types of secretory cells, and it would be informative to determine if
specific cell types support virus multiplication. This determination might better define
specific targets for countermeasures against TBFV infections. VLPs consistent with LGTV
virions were observed in the cells and lumen of granular acini, supporting the idea of
a role of these structures in virus multiplication. The cells containing the virions did not
exhibit the extreme membrane expansion characteristic of LGTV multiplication in
mammalian cells, a finding that was also noted previously in a report of LGTV infection
of I. scapularis embryonic cells (48).

 SG cultures from fed ticks represent a metabolic state that is very different from that
seen with unfed ticks. Blood feeding is associated with an increase in SG protein
synthesis as well as with the presence of virions when the SGs have secreted their
salivary components. Also, apoptosis and autophagy are initiated in SGs as a replete,
fed tick prepares to molt or lay eggs. Our observations in the SG cultures reflected this
marked change as evidenced by the extensive degranulation of the acinus and by the
increase in the size of the granular acinus (Fig. 3 and 4; see also Fig. S2 in the
supplemental material). Furthermore, we did not observe virions or obvious viral gene
expression in degranulated acinar cells as manifested by signal from LGTVGFP. However,
GFP signal was apparent in cells of the lobular ducts and tracheal ducts from the fed
tick cultures (Fig. 5A and E; see also Movie S1 and S5). Perhaps these are sites in which
virus is maintained in the tick as it progresses through molting or laying eggs. the
presence of LGTVGFP in the tracheal cells may also imply that this virus can use the
tracheal network connecting different organs as a route for infection, as in the case of
baculovirus infection in caterpillar (49). In future studies, we plan to prepare TBFV-
infected SGs from partially fed ticks and observe the effects on infection temporally
with greater detail.
Finally, we observed that transfection with dsRNA directed against the transcript for
VNN reduced virus production in SG cultures infected with POWV-L2 (Fig. 8A and B; see
also Fig. S4). This indicated a role for this gene in POWV-L2 infection in an organ critical
for virus transmission. It would also be beneficial to identify the VNN transcript
knockdown effect on TBFV multiplication from SG cultures pretreated with dsRNA and
the effect on the multiplication of other TBFVs, such as POWV-L1 and/or LGTV, that are
not naturally transmitted by I. scapularis. Orthologous mammalian VNN has been
associated with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked processes on the cell surfaces
(50), vitamin/CoA biosynthetic processes (50), hepatic gluconeogenesis (51, 52), and
lipid accumulation (53). Although the structure of human VNN1 has been elucidated
(54), very little is known about arthropod orthologs of VNN. There is low (33.9%) amino
acid conservation between human VNN1 and the I. scapularis ortholog (44); hence,
study of whether tick VNN affects cellular TBFV life cycle steps (44), especially within tick
SGs, would be worthwhile. Parallel RNA interference (RNAi)–whole-tick studies using
multiple TBFVs might be informative, but the durability of transcript knockdown and of
the function of the knocked-down transcript may complicate the experiments (55).
Thus, careful control of dsRNA application (56) and optimization of other parameters
will be crucial. Nonetheless, it will be important to identify whether the VNN transcript/
protein can functionally reduce not only TBFV infection but also TBFV transmission, an
important factor that a candidate target for a vaccine-based or small-molecule-based
countermeasure should have (9, 57).
In summary, we showed that ex vivo cultures can be used to analyze TBFV infection
of SGs from I. scapularis in different physiological states. The differences seen in TBV
infections of SGs in in vivo ticks (25, 38–40) were similarly observed in the cultures. We
provided evidence of the presence of virions in vacuoles of individual cells in granular
acini of SG cultures from unfed ticks, providing initial insight into possible cellular
functions used by infected cells in I. scapularis SGs. Additionally, we provided a
preliminary observation of TBFV infection in SGs from fed, female I. scapularis ticks.
Moreover, we provided initial evidence of the involvement of a tick transcript corre-
sponding to VNN in POWV-L2 infection by using RNAi-mediated transcript knockdown
in SG cultures from both fed and unfed I. scapularis female ticks. The SG cultures used
represent a convenient system for studying the biology of both the virus and the SG
itself.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
I. scapularis tick SG dissection and preparation. Fully engorged, replete (fed) female I. scapularis
ticks and unfed female I. scapularis ticks were obtained from a laboratory colony maintained at the
Oklahoma State University (OSU) Tick Rearing Facility. Ticks in different physiological states were housed
in humidified desiccators as described by Mitzel et al. (58). Fed ticks were subjected to dissection up to
6 days after receipt from the OSU Tick Rearing Facility (up to 7 days postcollection of blood feeding). Ticks

 were aseptically treated by soaking in 3% H2O2 for 15 s followed by soaking in 70% ethanol for 15 s (41).
After aseptic treatment, ticks were rinsed in three separate pools of sterile phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) on a sterile glass microscope slide and subsequently dissected in sterile PBS on a separate glass
microscope slide. L15C-300 medium (59, 60) with no supplemented antibiotics was used for SG culture
(41).
SG viability. To determine the viability, or the suggested duration of organ use in culture, data on
the metabolic activity of SGs from fed and unfed ticks were collected as described by Grabowski et al.
(41). One to three machine replicates (replicate reads from the plate reader) were completed with one
SG pair per well and with the corresponding control well that served as a biological replicate. Two to four
separate experiments were performed for each organ type (n � 2 to 4).
Cell and virus culture. As described before (41), I. scapularis ISE6 cells (kindly provided by Timothy
Kurtti, University of Minnesota) were cultured at 34°
C in complete L15C-300 medium without supple-
mented antibiotics and CO2 (80, 81). Vero cells were cultured at 37°
C in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s
medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Gibco, Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and with 5% CO2.
LGTVGFP plasmid construction and rescue of GFP-expressing LGTV (passage 1; used as working
stock for experimental infections) was performed as described before (41). Additionally, LGTVGFP,
LGTV (TP21 strain), POWV (LB prototype strain; POWV-L1; originally obtained from Robert Tesh,
University of Texas Medical Branch), and POWV-DTV (Spooner strain; POWV-L2; a gift from Gregory
D. Ebel, Colorado State University) stocks were created as described by Grabowski et al. (41).
POWV-L2 stock was also amplified in Vero cells at the same multiplicity of infection (MOI) and grown
in the same way as POWV-L1 to provide a working stock for experimental infections. LGTVGFP, LGTV,
POWV-L1, and POWV-L2 stock titers were determined in immunofocus assays as described by
Offerdahl et al. (48). The same method was used to determine infectious LGTV, POWV-L1, and
POWV-L2 titers in experimental samples, with 2 technical replicates per sample. In parallel, a mock
stock was prepared from mock-infected Vero cells.
Virus infection of SGs for LGTVGFP expression and infectious virus multiplication. To infect SG
cultures with LGTV for subsequent semithin section and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), SGs
were dissected as described above and placed into complete L15C-300 medium in wells of a 96-well
plate. Using a previously described method (41), a total volume of 5 � 105 focus-forming units (FFU)
of LGTV was placed into the infection wells, and mock stock was placed into mock infection wells.
Viral adsorption and incubation were completed using a previously described method (41). Organs
were collected at 3 and 180 hpi, with processing and staining of organs completed as described
below.
To determine levels of infectious POWV-L1 and POWV-L2 multiplication from SG cultures, the
culture and infection setup was completed using a previously described method (41). Supernatants
were collected from wells with SGs and wells with no SGs at 180 hpi, and virus titers were
determined in immunofocus assays as described above, with 2 to 3 separate experiments (n � 2 or
3). LGTVGFP infections of a SG pair from a fed tick and an unfed tick under culture conditions were
completed with imaging of LGTVGFP-infected SGs as described by Grabowski et al. (41), except that
fixation and confocal imaging of infected SGs were completed at 180 hpi (as described below).
Semithin section and transmission electron microscopy imaging of LGTV-infected SGs. LGTV
infection and SG collection parameters of mock- and LGTV-infected SGs from fed and unfed ticks were
performed as described above. Mock- and LGTV-infected SGs harvested at 3 and 180 hpi (postculture)
were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde–4% paraformaldehyde–0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4°
C
(similarly to a previously reported method [46]) for a minimum of 24 h. Samples were postfixed for 1 h
with 0.5% osmium tetroxide–0.8% potassium ferricyanide and stained overnight with 1% uranyl acetate
at 4°
C, dehydrated with a graded ethanol series. They were further dehydrated with 2 � 10 min with
100% propylene oxide and then infiltrated and embedded in Epon/araldite resin.
For semithin section imaging, these blocks were sectioned at 1-�m intervals using a Leica RM2265
microtome and diamond knife. Tissue sections were transferred to positively charged slides with a loop
and dried at 60°
C. Slides were stained with Stevenel’
s Blue for 10 min at 60°
C and air-dried. Coverslips
were placed onto the slides and viewed on a Zeiss model AxioVert.A1 microscope at �40 magnification,
and images were captured using a Zeiss model AxioCam 503 mono camera. Images were processed with
Zeiss ZEN 2 (blue edition) software using autoexposure settings.
For transmission electron microscopy imaging, the same blocks were sectioned with a Leica UC6
ultramicrotome (Vienna, Austria), stained with 1% uranyl acetate and Reynold’
s lead citrate, and viewed
at 80 kV on a Hitachi 7500 transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Digital images were acquired
with an AMT digital camera system (AMT, Chazy, NY). Images were processed with Zeiss ZEN 2 (blue
edition) software using autoexposure settings.
Confocal imaging of LGTVGFP-infected SGs. Dissection followed by mock and LGTVGFP infection
of SGs, performed as described above, was completed. SGs were then collected at 180 hpi and fixed
for a minimum of 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°
C. Individual SGs were washed briefly in 1� PBS
following fixation and mounted on microscope slides using ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Life
Technologies) and 12-mm-diameter coverslips (VWR). Mounts were set for at least 24 h at 4°
C prior
to being imaged on a LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Images were acquired using a frame size
of 2,048 by 2,048 pixels and 1.0� digital zoom with an EC Plan-Neofluar 10�/0.30 numerical
aperture (N.A.) or a Plan-Apochromat �63/1.40 N.A. oil objective. Z stacks used a stack thickness of
1 �m.

 Images were observed using Zeiss ZEN v2.3 (blue edition) software. For both mock- and LGTV-
infected SGs, �10 and �63 images were observed using a software display setting for both red and
green channels at settings of 25 and Auto Best Fit, respectively. Z stack images (�10 and �63) were
observed with the software display setting of Auto Best Fit. Movies of the processed Z stack images were
recorded with Imaris v8.4.1 software using a gamma correction of 2.0 with both red and green channels
at 400 frames.
Preparation of RNA from I. scapularis ISE6 cells/SGs and cDNA synthesis. RNA was isolated from
ISE6 cells grown using a T25 flask and an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and processed
according to kit instructions (44). RNA was also isolated as described above from LGTV-infected ISE6 cells
by the use of a previously described method (41). For RNA collection from SGs, four and three SG pairs
from fed and unfed ticks, respectively, were dissected as described above. The four or three SG pairs were
pooled separately in RNAlater (Qiagen) and placed at 4°
C for 24 h and then placed at �80°
C for longer
storage. To extract RNA from SGs from the fed and unfed ticks, RNAlater was carefully removed and
replaced with RLT lysis buffer (from the Qiagen RNeasy minikit). SGs were homogenized with Lysing
Matrix D tubes (MP Bio) using FastPrep 24 (MP Bio) (42) in the following manner: use of a speed setting
of 6 m/s for 40 s, placement on ice for 5 min, and use of a speed setting of 6 m/s for 40 s. The RLT lysis
buffer (homogenate) was cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 � g for 3 min and placed into columns for
further processing as described above according to the manufacturer’
s instructions for the RNeasy
minikit (Qiagen).
cDNA was synthesized from RNA samples using a previously described method (41, 44). An iScript
cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used, and the following thermocycler conditions
were used: 25°
C for 5 min, 42°
C for 50 min, and 85°
C for 5 min.
Synthesis of dsRNA corresponding to pGEM, LGTV 3=UTR, and I. scapularis VNN. A T7-tagged
cDNA template was generated using a previously described method (41, 44) by using cDNA prepared
from a pGEM-T Easy vector DNA plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI), LGTV-infected ISE6 cell RNA, and ISE6
cell RNA with the following T7-tagged primers corresponding to pGEM, the LGTV 3= untranslated region
(3=UTR), and I. scapularis VNN (XP_002402506): pGEM forward primer 5=-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGG
TATCAGCTCACTCAAAGG-3= and pGEM reverse primer 5=-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAACGACCTACAC
CGAACT-3=; LGTV 3=UTR forward primer 5=-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCAGACACAAGGAGTCCAA-3=
and LGTV 3=UTR reverse primer 5=-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATGGTGGCTCAGGGAGAAC-3=; VNN for-
ward primer 5=-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTACCACGGTGACGAGATTGC-3= and VNN reverse primer 5=-T
AATACGACTCACTATAGGGTATGTGAGCTCCGCTTGAGG-3=. Two-step PCR was performed under the fol-
lowing thermocycler conditions: 94°
C for 5 min; 5 cycles of 94°
C for 30 s, 58°
C for 30 s, and 72°
C for 2 min;
27 cycles of 94°
C for 30 s, 68°
C for 30 s, and 72°
C for 2 min; and final extension at 72°
C for 7 min. dsRNA
was synthesized from T7-tagged cDNA template using a MEGAscript RNAi synthesis kit according to the
manufacturer’
s instructions and previously described methods (41, 44, 61).
Confirmation of I. scapularis VNN transcript in SGs from fed and unfed ticks was completed with cDNA
from SGs, �-actin/VNN primers (�-actin forward primer 5=-GAGAAGATGACCCAGATCAT-3= and �-actin
reverse primer 5=-TGGTGATCACCTGTCCGTCG-3= and VNN forward primer 5=-TACCACGGTGACGAGATTG
C-3= and VNN reverse primer 5=-TATGTGAGCTCCGCTTGAGG-3=), and a PCR (using Phusion high-fidelity
PCR master mix with HF buffer [NE Biolabs, Ipswich, USA]) under the following thermocycler conditions:
94°
C for 5 min; 32 cycles of 94°
C for 30 s, 58°
C for 30 s, and 72°
C for 2 min; and 72°
C for 7 min (44).
Following gel electrophoresis on 1.2% Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) agarose with SYBR Safe (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), the presence of a VNN amplicon of the expected size (607 bp) was confirmed (see
Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). This VNN amplicon was also sequenced from ISE6 cells and an
unfed, female I. scapularis tick in previous work (44) and confirmed to be highly (96% to 97%) conserved
with respect to the I. scapularis VNN gene model transcript.
Transfection of infected SGs with dsRNA and transcript knockdown. POWV-L2 infection of SG
cultures before overlay of transfection mix was completed as described above for determining infectious
TBFV multiplication. Overlay of media and transfection mix was completed as described previously (41,
44, 61). At 108 hpi, supernatants were collected from the POWV-L2-infected, dsRNA-transfected organs
and subjected to immunofocus assays (as described above) to determine infectious virus multiplication
levels. The time point of 108 h of transfection was utilized due to its being amply efficient for transcript
knockdown in tick SG cultures (55, 62), and SGs from both fed and unfed ticks were found to be viable
and producing infectious virus.
To determine transcript knockdown following VNN dsRNA transfection, three pairs and six pairs of
SGs from fed and unfed ticks, respectively, were transfected separately with either VNN dsRNA or pGEM
dsRNA. All three or six pairs (transfected with either VNN or pGEM dsRNA) were pooled to extract RNA
and synthesize cDNA as described above. Relative levels of VNN transcript was determined using a
QuantiFast SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) primers
relative to the I. scapularis �-actin gene (the RT-qPCR primers used were VNN forward primer 5=-CTAC
AACACCAACGTGGCCT-3= and VNN reverse primer 5=-AAGGGCTCCACAAACAGGTG-3= and �-actin forward
primer 5=-GCCGGGACCTTACAGACTATC-3= and �-actin reverse primer 5=-CACGGACAATTTCACGCTCG-3=)
(44). Reactions were performed on the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 Flex real-time system (Life
Technologies) in Micro-Amp Optical 384-well reaction plates with labeled barcode (Life Technolo-
gies). QuantStudio real-time PCR software (v1.3) was used to collect raw threshold cycle (CT) values,
the comparative CT method (ΔΔCT method) (44, 63, 64) was used to determine relative transcript
expression levels, and an unpaired, two-tailed t test was performed with GraphPad Prism (v7.04)
software.
