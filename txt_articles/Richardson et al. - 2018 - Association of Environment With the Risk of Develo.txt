IMPORTANCE Social determinants are important risk factors for the development of
first-episode psychosis (FEP); their effects in rural areas are largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE To investigate neighborhood-level factors associated with FEP in a large,
predominantly rural population-based cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study extracted data on referrals for treatment
of potential FEP at 6 Early-Intervention Psychosis services from the Social Epidemiology of
Psychoses in East Anglia naturalistic cohort study data set, which covered a population of
more than 2 million people in a rural area in the East of England for a period of 3.5 years. All
individuals aged 16 to 35 years who presented to Early-Intervention Psychosis services and
met diagnostic criteria for first episodes of nonaffective psychoses and affective psychoses
(International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth
Revision diagnostic codes F20-33) were included (n = 631). Persons whose disorders had an
organic basis (diagnostic codes F06.X) and those meeting the criteria for substance-induced
psychosis (diagnostic codes F1X.5) were excluded. We derived 4 neighborhood-level
exposures from a routine population data set using exploratory factor analysis (racial/ethnic
diversity, deprivation, urbanicity, and social isolation) and investigated intragroup
racial/ethnic density and fragmentation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multilevel Poisson regression was performed to determine
associations between incidence rates and neighborhood-level factors, after adjustment for
individual factors. Results were reported as incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
RESULTS The study included 631 participants who met criteria for FEP and whose median age
at first contact was 23.8 years (interquartile range, 19.6-27.6 years); 416 of 631 (65.9%) were
male. Crude incidence of FEP was calculated as 31.2 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI,
28.9-33.7). Incidence varied significantly between neighborhoods after adjustment for age,
sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. For nonaffective psychoses, incidence was
higher in neighborhoods that were more economically deprived (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.20)
and socially isolated (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.19). It was lower in more racially/ethnically
diverse neighborhoods (IRR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.00). Higher intragroup racial/ethnic density
(IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-1.00) and lower intragroup racial/ethnic fragmentation (IRR, 0.98;
95% CI, 0.96-1.00) were associated with a reduced risk of affective psychosis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Spatial variation in the incidence of nonaffective and affective
psychotic disorders exists in rural areas. This suggests that the social environment
contributes to psychosis risk across the rural-urban gradient.

eople born and raised in urban environments face el-
evated risk of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia
compared with people living in rural areas.1,2 This is
not explained by family history of psychiatric illness or other
potential confounders, such as paternal age,2 age,3,4 sex,3,4 or
race/ethnicity.5 Several socioenvironmental factors have been
proposedtoexplainthevariation,includingdeprivation(asingle

tion, housing, environment, and crime into an approxi-
mationoftheoverallsocioeconomicprosperityofanarea),6-9in-
equality (a quantification of relative, rather than absolute,
deprivation),9socialfragmentation(alackofsocialconnections

ethnic density (a measure of the degree to which people of the
same racial/ethnic origin live together in a given geographic
location).9However,muchlessresearchhasinvestigatedwhether

versities, in part because of the difficulty of conducting studies
of rare outcomes in sparse population settings. A collection of
studiesfromruralIreland16-18hassuggestedthatratesmayvary

We used epidemiological data from a large, naturalistic
cohort of participants who presented to Early Intervention in
Psychosis (EIP) services with first-episode psychosis (FEP) to
investigate whether psychosis incidence varied according to
neighborhood-level social and environmental factors in a
predominantly rural setting in the East of England. We
hypothesized that, after adjusting for individual-level fac-
tors, (1) nonaffective psychoses would show spatial variation
in incidence across different neighborhoods; (2) affective
psychoses would show less spatial variation; (3) incidence
rates would be higher in more deprived, more socially
isolated, and more urban parts of the study region; (4)
neighborhood-level racial/ethnic density would be inversely
associated with the relative risk of FEP in black and minority
racial/ethnic groups; and (5) racial/ethnic fragmentation
would be inversely associated with the relative risk of FEP in
black and minority racial/ethnic groups.
Methods
Setting
WeuseddatafromtheSocialEpidemiologyofPsychosesinEast
Anglia study,4 which ascertained all incidence cases present-
ing to EIP services during 3.5 years. The catchment area con-
tained 2.4 million people in 2011 and was predominantly
rural (median population per square mile, 587.8; interquar-
tile range, 208.9-4653.4) compared with the rest of England
(median population per square mile, 3645.6; interquartile
range, 573.1-8976.3) (Mann-Whitney U, 12.1; P < .001).
Ethics
The Cambridgeshire III Local Research Ethics Committee
(09/H0309/39) granted ethical approval for this study to col-
lect anonymized statistical data without informed consent.
This was consistent with the use of statistical data in the pub-
lic interest as specified in the United Kingdom Data Protec-
tion Act of 1998.27
Case Ascertainment
In England, EIP services are the sole referral point for all people
with suspected FEP. Services in the catchment area worked
closely with primary, secondary, and tertiary health care ser-
vices, including general practitioners, other mental health fa-
cilities in the National Health Service, schools, and universi-
ties; we have previously shown case ascertainment via these
services leads to unbiased estimates of incidence.4,5 We fol-
lowed up with all participants accepted by EIP services until
they had received 3 years of care or were discharged from ser-
vices (if the discharge occurred before 3 years had elapsed).
In this study, we included participants if, at first referral, they
were aged 16 to 35 years; resided in the catchment area (ex-
cluding those of no fixed abode); had no previous contact with
health services for psychosis and no previous treatment with
antipsychotic medication for more than 6 months; and were
presenting to EIP services with clinical evidence of a FEP, per
the criteria of diagosis found in International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Re-
vision (ICD-10) (codes F20-33). Patients with comorbid mod-
erateorseverelearningdisabilities,anorganicbasistodisorder,
or substance-induced psychosis (ICD-10 code F1X.5) were ex-
cluded from the study.
Participants who met the inclusion criteria were subse-
quently assessed to confirm a diagnosis of ICD-10 psychotic
disorder via standardized case note review according to
the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness,21
a reliable diagnostic instrument22 with good interrater
reliability.4 We classified participants according to 3 out-
comes, as described in detail elsewhere4: first, by all nonor-
ganic psychotic disorders (ICD-10 codes F20-33), then into
groups of nonaffective psychotic disorders (F20-29) and
affective psychotic disorders (F30-33).
Key Points
Question Is the social and built environment associated with the
risk of developing psychotic disorders in rural populations?
Findings In this cohort study of 631 persons with first-episode
psychosis, significant variation was found in the incidence of
nonaffective and affective psychotic disorders between rural
neighborhoods. Nonaffective psychoses occurred more frequently
in more economically deprived, more socially isolated, and less
racially/ethnically diverse communities, while greater intragroup
racial/ethnic density and less racial/ethnic fragmentation were
associated with lower rates of affective psychoses after taking into
account individual factors.
Meaning Exposure to social adversities potentially influences
psychosis risk across the rural-urban continuum.

 Sociodemographic Variables
At first referral, we used a standardized form to collect basic
sociodemographic data on all participants, including age at re-
ferral, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and
neighborhood of residence. Age was treated as categorical
(16-19, 20-24, 25-29, and 30-35 years). Participants self-
reported 1 of 18 racial/ethnic categories from the 2011 census,23
which we collapsed into 11 analytical groups (white British,
white other, mixed white and black Caribbean, mixed other,
Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black African, black Carib-
bean, Arab, and any other racial/ethnic group). Of these, all
groups except the white British were also grouped into a black
and minority racial/ethnic group for the purposes of descrip-
tive data reporting. Socioeconomic status was based on par-
ticipantoccupationatpresentation(perOfficeforNationalSta-
tistics decision rules24,25) and was categorized into 5 groups:
people in professional and managerial occupations; those
in intermediate occupations, small employers, and self-
employed persons; lower supervisory and technical employ-
ees; those in semiroutine and routine jobs; and students, un-
employed persons, and those who had never worked.
Neighborhood-Level Exposures
The study region was organized into 530 administrative neigh-
borhoodsknownasstatisticalwards,whichformedthearea-level
unit of analysis in our study (median population, 3992 people;
interquartile range, 2426-5935). We included a comprehensive
set of 29 social and built environment variables—putatively rel-
evanttothecausalmechanismsofpsychosis—fromroutinedata
sources(eAppendixandeTable1intheSupplement).Allvariables
wereenteredintoanexploratoryfactoranalysiswithVarimaxro-
tationtoidentifydistinctneighborhood-levelsocioenvironmen-
tal exposures. We omitted 7 neighborhood variables with poor
psychometric properties from the final factor analysis (eTable 1
andeFigureintheSupplement).Factorretentionwasidentified
by examination of a scree plot, with substantive item loadings
(≥0.4) taken to indicate important associations. We extracted
neighborhood-level factor scores for each factor and standard-
ized to have a mean of 0 and SD of 1. We created categorical ver-
sions of each factor to test for possible nonlinear associations
with our outcomes, which involved classifying neighborhoods
aslow(≤25thpercentile),medium(26th-75thpercentile)andhigh
(≥76th percentile) on each exposure.
Separately, we estimated neighborhood-level intragroup
racial/ethnic density and fragmentation, because we were
interested in their independent effects on psychosis risk.
Intragroup racial/ethnic density was defined as the propor-
tion of the racial/ethnic group of a given participant in each
neighborhood.9 Intragroup racial/ethnic fragmentation was
defined as the distribution of the racial/ethnic group of a
given participant across a neighborhood; this was measured
using Peach Index of Dissimilarity,26 which is based on the
percentage of people from a given racial/ethnic group who
would have to move to another part of the same neighbor-
hood to live in a totally integrated spatial pattern with the
remainder of the total population. Higher percentages indi-
cated higher segregation, and therefore lower intragroup
racial/ethnic fragmentation.
Population at Risk
The population at risk was estimated from the 2011 census of
Great Britain,23 which was collected close to the midpoint of
case ascertainment for the present study. Data were stratified
by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and SES. The total was mul-
tiplied by 3.5 years to estimate person-years at risk.
Statistical Analysis
First, we reported descriptive statistics of the sample accord-
ing to neighborhood-level exposures, with 2-tailed χ2 tests to
analyze differences between each psychosis outcome and the
population at risk. Second, we characterized variations in the
social and built environment using factors derived from the
exploratory factor analysis. Third, using these derived neigh-
borhood-level exposures, we conducted multilevel Poisson re-
gression with random intercepts to investigate the effects of
factors on incidence for each outcome, after controlling for in-
dividual-level age, sex, race/ethnicity, and SES. Modeling pro-
ceeded as follows: null (empty) models were created to quan-
tify initial variance in incidence at the neighborhood level.
Individual-level a priori confounders were then added to the
model to quantify changes to this variance. Finally, we con-
structed multivariable models by adding neighborhood-level
exposures as fixed effects in the order of their strength of as-
sociation with a given outcome, as reported in univariable
analyses. These analyses were based on Akaike Information
Criterion, where lower scores indicated better model fit. Model
building was tested via the likelihood ratio test (LRT). In our
final models, we tested for departure from linearity of our con-
tinuous neighborhood-level exposures by substituting the
equivalentcategoricalconstructs(asdescribedabove)andcom-
paringAkaikeInformationCriterionscoresbetweenthesenon-
nested models.
We tested for statistical interaction between individual-
level race/ethnicity and neighborhood-level intragroup racial/
ethnic density or fragmentation to investigate whether their
effects on psychosis risk differed by racial/ethnic group. We
checked final models against Poisson regression assump-
tions (overdispersion, zero inflation) and found that they were
not violated (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The present study
reports incidence rate ratios (IRRs) that compare relative dif-
ference in psychosis incidence between groups separated by
1 or more SD with respect to the socioenvironmental factors
under exploration. In addition, 95% confidence intervals (CI)
are reported. All statistical tests were set at a significance level
of P < .05.
Results
Sample Demographics and Crude Incidence Rates
Of the 631 individuals who met inclusion criteria for psy-
chotic disorders under ICD-10 codes F20 through 33 (Table 1),
573 (87.2%) received diagnoses of nonaffective psychoses
(ICD-10 codes F20-29) and 84 (12.8%) received diagnoses of
affective psychoses (ICD-10 codes F30-33). This corre-

 for nonaffective psychoses (95% CI, 24.9-29.5), and 4.1 for af-
fective psychoses (95% CI, 3.3-5.1). Median age at first con-
tact was 23.8 years (interquartile range, 19.6-27.6 years). Com-
pared with the population at risk, participants with FEP were
more likely to be male, younger, unemployed, of lower SES,
and from a black and minority racial/ethnic group (P < .001;
allcomparisonsaredetailedinTable1).Participantsfromthese
backgrounds had lower intragroup racial/ethnic density, were
moreracially/ethnicallyfragmented,andlivedinmoreracially/
ethnically diverse neighborhoods than the white British popu-
lation (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Exploratory Factor Analysis
Our exploratory factor analysis (eTable 4 in the Supplement)
suggested that 4 latent constructs of socioenvironmental ad-
versity provided the optimum factor solution, informed by in-
spection of a scree plot (eFigure in the Supplement). These 4
factors explained 90% of total variance in 22 neighborhood
items. We termed the first factor racial/ethnic diversity be-
causeitincludedseveralitemsrelatedtotheracial/ethniccom-
position of a neighborhood, including the proportion of people
whose identity was ascribed to a national identity from a place
other than the United Kingdom, recent overseas immigra-
tion,anitem-levelestimateofracial/ethnicdiversity,andpopu-
lation turnover (inmigration to and outmigration from the
neighborhood). We termed the second factor deprivation be-
causeseveralitemsrelatedtosocioeconomicconditionsloaded
strongly onto this dimension, including a negative associa-
tion with inequality. Our third factor was a construct of urba-
nicity,withastrongpositiveloadingonpopulationdensity,and

Multilevel Modeling
Neighborhood Variance for All Outcomes
Anullmultilevelmodelindicatedstatisticallysignificantneigh-
borhood-level variance in all FEP outcomes, which showed
littleattenuationaftercontrolforindividual-levelage,sex,race/
ethnicity, and SES (Table 2). Inclusion of neighborhood-level
exposures in our final models (described below) reduced this
variance to nonsignificance for nonaffective psychoses (SD,
0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.33; P = .15) and affective psychoses (SD,
0.58; 95% CI, 0.19-1.78; P = .09) separately, although residual
variance remained when all FEP psychoses were considered
as a single outcome (SD, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.02-0.22; P = .02).
All First-Episode Psychosis
InunadjustedPoissonregression,weobservedassociationsbe-
tween FEP and racial/ethnic diversity, deprivation, and social
isolation (Table 3). After adjustment for individual-level fac-
tors in our final multilevel model, 3 neighborhood-level ex-
posures were associated with psychosis risk: deprivation (with
a change in 1 SD from the mean: IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.19),
social isolation (IRR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16), and urbanicity
(IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.23) (P = .04). There was no evidence
of interaction between race/ethnicity and racial/ethnic den-
sity (LRT χ 2
10 = 10.8; P = .37) or racial/ethnic fragmentation
(LRT χ2
10 = 14.0; P = .17).
Nonaffective Psychoses
We observed similar results for nonaffective psychoses as a
separate outcome (Table 3), with greater deprivation (IRR, 1.13;
95% CI, 1.06-1.20) and social isolation (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-

 was also some evidence that greater racial/ethnic diversity was
associated with lower incidence (IRR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-
1.00; LRT P = .05); urbanicity did not improve the final model
(LRT χ2
1 = 2.7; P = .10). There was no interaction between race/
ethnicity and racial/ethnic density (LRT χ2
10 = 11.0; P = .36) or
racial/ethnic fragmentation (LRT χ2
10 = 6.9; P = .73).
Affective Psychoses
Inourfinalmodelforaffectivepsychoses,lowerincidencerates
were independently associated with greater intragroup racial/
ethnic density (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.00) and lower intra-
group racial/ethnic fragmentation (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-
1.00) (Table 3). Together, these 2 factors could be described
as higher segregation of racial/ethnic groups. There was no in-
teraction between race/ethnicity and racial/ethnic density
(LRT χ2
10 = 4.4; P = .93), or race/ethnicity and race/ethnic frag-
mentation (LRT χ2
10 = 17.4; P = .07). Nevertheless, further in-
spection suggested that while lower fragmentation was asso-
ciated with reduced incidence of affective psychoses for most
groups (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98), this pattern was re-
versed for people of mixed (other) racial/ethnic backgrounds
(IRR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.16).
Categorical Neighborhood Variables
For all outcomes, there was no evidence that the observed pat-
tern of associations with neighborhood-level exposures
showed a departure from linearity when our final models were
refitted with categorical variables.
Discussion
Interpretation of Principal Findings
To our knowledge, this is the largest epidemiological study of
psychoticdisorderriskinruralenvironments,andwehavepro-
vided strong evidence of neighborhood-level variation in non-
affective and affective psychotic disorders that cannot be ex-
plained by individual-level factors. This variance was
associated with signs of the social and built environment, in-
cluding socioeconomic deprivation, urbanicity, racial/ethnic
density, and racial/ethnic fragmentation, where effects on risk
were generally similar for all racial/ethnic groups. Unlike pre-
vious studies in more urban populations and in contrast to our
hypothesis, we found significant variation in affective psy-
chotic disorders; this was largely explained by neighborhood-
level racial/ethnic composition. Our results suggest that so-
cial and physical attributes of neighborhoods influence the
spatial patterning of psychotic disorders across the rural-
urban continuum.
Our research extends well-established findings that
urban living is associated with psychosis risk. Like previous
studies,1,2 we found higher FEP rates in more urban parts of
our study region. However, our study setting was predomi-
nantly rural, and here, rates also varied by deprivation,
social isolation, and neighborhood racial/ethnic composi-
tion. Deprivation has previously been linked to FEP risk in
rural Ireland,18 although, unlike the present investigation,
that study did not control for individual-level SES. Impor-
tantly, our findings suggest that the social environment may
affect the incidence of psychotic disorders across the rural-
urban gradient. This is important because it implies that
some of the social determinants of psychosis incidence—
including exposure to deprivation or social isolation—are
risk factors regardless of where they occur; nonetheless,
such exposures are likely to have greater effect in urban
areas by virtue of their population size and structure, given
that young people and people from racial/ethnic minority
backgrounds—both of whom are at greater psychosis risk of
psychotic disorders4,5—are more likely to live in cities.
The mechanisms through which the social environment
acts on psychosis risk are worthy of further consideration.
People living in more deprived areas might also be exposed to
other adverse living conditions, such as high crime rates, ex-
posure to violence, social stress, and lower quality or quan-
tity of local services, including housing and other amenities.15
Similarly, neighborhoods with higher social isolation may fail
to buffer people from the negative consequences of stress af-
ter exposure to social adversity, potentially leaving them vul-
nerabletodevelopingpsychosis28,29;corollaryevidenceofsuch
a buffering effect exists after exposure to childhood trauma.30
Social isolation and fragmentation have also been associated
with psychotic disorders in nationwide studies10,31 and more
urban populations.32
If social isolation is a risk factor for psychotic disorders,
then factors that buffer its effect—including neighborhood
racial/ethnic composition—might be protective. Here, greater

 racial/ethnic diversity was associated with reduced inci-
dence of nonaffective psychoses; this might be an indication
of bridging social capital (ie, connections, support, and trust
between different groups) and suggests the benefit of pro-
moting better racial/ethnic integration and social support in
rural communities. These results accord with a previous
finding on FEP risk and racial/ethnic integration among
black Caribbean communities in East London.9 Nonetheless,
most previous studies have shown that higher intragroup
racial/ethnic density, a possible sign of bonding social capital
(ie, connections, support and trust within a particular
group), also reduces psychosis risk,9,28,33-35 but we only
observed this association in people with affective psychoses.
Our results with respect to affective psychoses were novel,
given that other studies have predominantly failed to
observe variance in incidence at the neighborhood level.1 In
rural England—where black and minority racial/ethnic
groups represent a small proportion of the total population
(eTable 3 in the Supplement)—bridging social capital may
become more relevant to mitigating social stress than bond-
ing social capital, given more limited opportunities to inter-
act with people from one’
s own racial/ethnic minority group
in the immediate environment.
Methodological Considerations
Our study had several strengths. We used epidemiological data
from a large, naturalistic cohort study using operationalized
criteria to identify cases. We excluded people with an organic
or substance-induced basis to their disorder and used broad
psychotic phenotypes as our outcomes to minimize diagnos-
tic bias. The sample was sufficiently large and diverse to con-
sidertheroleofseveralenvironmentalfactors,includingracial/
ethnic diversity and, to our knowledge for the first time in
relation to psychosis, aspects of the built environment. Here,
our construct of urbanicity, which was positively associated
with FEP incidence, included population density and novel in-
dicators of the built environment, including green space, non-
residentialbuildings,andtraveltimestatistics.Thisgaveamore
precise estimation of urbanicity than previously used.
Limitations
We note some important limitations of our study. Case ascer-
tainment was based on presentation to EIP services in the East
of England. While these services were engaged actively in out-
reach and were the sole referral point for young people with
suspected psychotic symptoms, we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility that some incident cases were missed, given that we

 were unable to conduct a leakage study. It is unclear whether
this would have differentiated places; for example, the cur-
rent evidence is equivocal as to whether duration of un-
treated psychosis—a possible indication of delayed ascertain-
ment—isassociatedwithdistancetoservices.36,37Nevertheless,
our previous research4,5 demonstrates that the magnitude and
patterns of incidence overall, and by age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and SES are in line with rates from other studies.38 The low in-
cidence of affective psychoses, particularly compared with
nonaffective psychoses, may have affected statistical power
to detect some associations, although we observed neighbor-
hood-level variation on this outcome. Similarly, measures of
intragroup neighborhood racial/ethnic density and fragmen-
tation were based on small numbers, which may have limited
powertodetectcross-levelinteractionswithrace/ethnicity.We
were unable to adjust for some important potential confound-
ers, including family history of psychosis,39 marital status,11,38
and prior substance use, because these data were not avail-
able for the denominator (census) population. We could only
control for 1 aspect of SES, which was occupation; this could
have led to some residual confounding at the individual level.
Exposure and outcome data were collected contemporane-
ously, and, as such, we cannot exclude the potential for re-
verse causality. Further, given the risk of ecological fallacy, we
cannot definitively infer that individuals living in neighbor-
hoods with high levels of the exposures included in our study
were directly exposed to them. In general, while neighbor-
hood associations were robust, they were small in magni-
tude, typically resulting in about a 10% change in incidence
associated with a change in exposure 1 SD in size.
Conclusions
We found evidence of variation in the incidence of FEP across
the rural-urban continuum, associated with deprivation, so-
cial isolation, and racial/ethnic composition. Social adversi-
ties, or failure to assuage the negative consequences of such
adversities,40 may increase risk,39 but carefully designed
longitudinal studies are required to determine causality.
