Abstract
The gradual deterioration of cognitive functions in Alzheimer’s disease is paralleled by a hierarchical progression of amy-
loid-beta and tau brain pathology. Recent findings indicate that toxic oligomers of amyloid-beta may cause propagation of 
pathology in a prion-like manner, although the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that 
small extracellular vesicles, exosomes, from Alzheimer patients’ brains contain increased levels of amyloid-beta oligomers 
and can act as vehicles for the neuron-to-neuron transfer of such toxic species in recipient neurons in culture. Moreover, 
blocking the formation, secretion or uptake of exosomes was found to reduce both the spread of oligomers and the related 
toxicity. Taken together, our results imply that exosomes are centrally involved in Alzheimer’s disease and that they could 
serve as targets for development of new diagnostic and therapeutic principles.

Introduction
Gradual accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau are 
believed to be central to Alzheimer´s disease (AD) patho-
genesis. These abnormal deposits typically appear with a 
hierarchical spatial distribution, which suggest that the 
pathological proteins can propagate between different brain 
areas [7, 52, 53]. Accordingly, recent studies have demon-
strated transfer of Aβ in cellular and animal models [27, 
38–40, 61] as well as spread of tau between neurons in the 
brain of transgenic mouse models [25]. These observations 
are further supported by the distribution of Aß and tau PET 
ligands in relation to the brain connectome [45].
Different Aβ conformational states have different proper-
ties, and intermediate products of fibril formation, such as 
lower molecular weight Aβ oligomers (oAβ) and protofi-
brils, have been suggested to be particularly neurotoxic and 
to act as seeds for further aggregation [27, 61]. In addition, 
these soluble forms of Aß correlate better than fibrils with 
cognitive function in the AD brain [39]. We have previ-
ously shown that oAβ can accumulate inside cells and sub-
sequently spread from one cell to another [15, 40]. These 
findings thus suggest that Aβ can propagate pathology in 
a manner similar to what is seen for prion disorders and 
for several other neurodegenerative diseases [8]. However, 
the underlying mechanisms for the spreading of toxic oAβ 
remain incompletely understood [28].
Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles (20–120 nm in diam-
eter) [58] developing from endosomes through multivesicular 
bodies, have recently emerged as key players in cellular com-
munication and transport of molecules in both health and dis-
ease, including neuronal toxicity [33] and neurodegenerative 
disorders [59]. Exosomes can carry different cargos such as 
proteins, RNA and miRNA and can also contain monomeric

Aß, tau and α-synuclein [12, 17, 46, 59] and can propagate tau 
pathology [4]. Thus, exosomes could potentially also carry 
aggregated proteins such as oAß. However, no study has so far 
investigated if exosomes isolated from AD brain tissue can be 
responsible for interneuronal protein transfer.
For the first time, we now demonstrate that intracellular 
oAβ is co-localized with exosomes and show that AD brain-
derived exosomes can mediate neuron-to-neuron propaga-
tion of oAß. Furthermore, we show that the concentration of 
oAβ in exosomes is significantly increased in post mortem 
AD brains. In addition, exosomes carrying oAβ can be inter-
nalized in cultured neurons and spread their toxic content to 
nearby cells.
Methods
Brain tissues
Post mortem brain samples of temporal neocortex from 
healthy control (1 female, 4 male) and AD (4 female, 1 male) 
subjects (Table 1) were provided by the brain bank at Uppsala 
University, Sweden. The tissue was received as fresh-frozen 
or as formalin‐fixed (4% formaldehyde) paraffin-embedded 
blocks. The AD cases were neuropathologically diagnosed 
as CERAD C, Braak stages IV–VI. None of the control 
patients suffered from dementia or any neurodegenerative 
disorder. The collection and use of post mortem brain tissue 
was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee in Uppsala, 
Sweden (2005/103, 2005-06-29; 2009/089; 2009-04-22).
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence 
of brain sections
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 10 μm sections of tempo-
ral neocortex from healthy control and AD brains (Table 1) 
were used for this study and pretreated as previously 
described [6]. After 5 min blocking of endogenous peroxi-
dase by incubation in Background Sniper (Biocare Medical), 
slides were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution 
and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-flotillin-1 (Abcam, 
1:200) followed by incubation with either the second pri-
mary mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb158, 1:7500, Bio-
Arctic) or mouse monoclonal antibody 82E1 (1:25, IBL 
International) for 30 min at room temperature (RT).
After rinsing in TBS, the slides were incubated for 30 min 
with MACH 2 Double Stain (Biocare Medical). Following 
this step, a 30 min incubation was performed with an AP 
linked chromogen IP Warp red/HRP linked chromogen Vina 
Green cocktail (Biocare Medical). After rinsing in deionized 
water, the sections were counterstained with Mayers haema-
toxylin (Histolab Products AB) and mounted with Pertex 
mounting media (Histolab Products AB) and micrographs 
were obtained using 100 × oil immersion objective (Nikon 
Eclipse 80i, Digital Sight DS-Fi1).
After blocking and incubating with primary antibod-
ies as described above, the slides were rinsed in TBS and 
incubated with a Fluorescence Enhancement Probe Mouse/
Fluorescence Enhancement Probe Rabbit cocktail (Biocare 
Medical) for 20 min subsequent to a 40 min incubation with 
a Goat-anti-Mouse DyLight 549/Goat Anti-Rabbit DyLight 
488 cocktail (Biocare Medical) diluted 1:200, respectively. 
After rinsing in deionized water, the sections were nuclear 
counterstained with DAPI and mounted with Fluoro Care 
Anti-Fade Mountant (Biocare Medical) and analysed with a 
Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. The differential inter-
face contrast (DIC) mode and 405, 488, 555 and 639 lasers 
were used to acquire the images with 63x/1.40 oil immersion 
plan-apochromatic DICII objectives. The micrographs were 
processed using Huygens (Scientific Volume Imaging) and 
ZEN lite (blue edition) software.

Cell lines and differentiation
Two different cultured cell types were used in the study: the 
human-induced pluripotent stem cells, AF22 (from a control 
subject) and the human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y 
(ECACC: Sigma-Aldrich). The neuroepithelial stem cell 
line, AF22, derived from human-induced pluripotent stem 
cells from human skin fibroblasts was provided by Dr. Anna 
Falk, Karolinska Institute, Sweden. The process of repro-
gramming human cells was approved by the Ethical Com-
mittee at Karolinska Institute, Sweden (dnr 2012/208-31/3 
with addendum 2012/856-32). All samples were given with 
informed consent. The AF22 cell line has previously been 
shown to have a stable neuronal differentiation competence 
and the capacity to generate functionally mature human 
neurons [20], denoted hiPSC. The hiPSCs were cultured 
on 0.01% poly-l-ornithine and laminin (10 µg/mL, Sigma-
Aldrich) coated cell culture flasks (Corning) in DMEM/
F12 media (Gibco by Life Technologies), supplemented 
with EGF (10 ng/mL, PeproTech), FGF2 (10 ng/mL, Pep-
roTech), N2 (5 µl/ml, Life Technologies) and B27 (1 ml/L, 
Life Technologies) and further differentiated for 40 days to 
functionally mature human neurons in 1:1 DMEM, neuroba-
sal media containing B27 (10 µl/ml), Laminin (1 µl/ml) and 
N2 (5 µl/ml) as previously described [20].
Neuronal differentiation of the human neuroblastoma cell 
line SH-SY5Y was performed as previously described [1]. 
In brief, SH-SY5Y cells were cultured and pre-differentiated 
for 7 days using 10 μM retinoic acid (RA; Sigma-Aldrich; 
denoted as raSH-SY5Y). Pre-differentiated raSH-SY5Y 
cells were seeded on 6-, 12- or 24-well glass plates coated 
with 20% extracellular matrix (ECM) gel (BD Bioscience) 
and further differentiated for 10 days with serum-free MEM 
(Gibco by Life Technologies) supplemented with brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 50 ng/ml, PeproTech), 
neuregulin β1 (NRGβ1,10 ng/ml, R&D Systems), nerve 
growth factor (NGF, 10 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and vitamin 
D3 (VitD3, 24 nM, Sigma-Aldrich). These fully differenti-
ated cells are denoted dSH-SY5Y.
In addition, SH-SY5Y cells expressing a CD63-EGFP 
fusion protein were generated using AddGene plasmid 
#62964.
Labelling and oligomerization of Aβ1‑42
Recombinant Aβ1-42 peptides (Innovagen,) was dissolved 
in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP, Sigma-Aldrich) 
and vacuum dried overnight. Aβ1-42 (1.054 mM final con-
centration) was resuspended in  
Na2CO3 (0.1 M pH 8.5) and 
incubated with the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 700 (AF700) 
succinimidyl ester (1.58 mM final concentration, Life Tech-
nologies) for 40 min at 4 °C or the fluorophore 6-carboxyte-
tramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (TMR, Invitrogen), 
in a molar ratio of 2:, incubated overnight at 4 °C. Labelled 
Aβ1-42 was diluted to a final concentration of 100 µM in 
HEPES 20 mM pH 7.4, vortexed, sonicated for 10 min and 
incubated at 4 °C overnight. After the overnight incubation, 
Aβ1-42 was separated from free dye with size exclusion 
chromatography (SEC). A Sephadex 75 10/300 GL column 
coupled to a liquid chromatography system (ÄKTA pure, 
GE Healthcare) was equilibrated with  
NH4HCO3 50 mM 
pH 8.5 and 500 µl of sample was injected into the column. 
To estimate the molecular weight of the Aβ species, LMW 
gel filtration calibration kits (GE Healthcare) were used. 
Oligomeric and monomeric Aβ species were eluted at a 
flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, collected and lyophilized. Then, 
Aβ species (oAβ-AF700) were resuspended in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) solution and quantified spectrophoto-
metrically at 215 nm by using the Aβ1-42 extinction coef-
ficient (Aβ1-42 ɛ214 nm = 75,887 M−1 cm−1) according to 
Lambert–Beer’s law. Protein aliquots were stored at − 80 °C.
Exosome purification, characterization and labelling
Isolation of brain exosomes from extracellular space of 
freshly frozen human brain tissues (250 mg) was performed 
as previously described [42]. Tissue was dissociated with 
papain (20 units/ml, 15 min at 37 °C, Sigma-Aldrich) fol-
lowed by filtration through 40 µm mesh filter (BD Bio-
sciences) and a 0.2 µm syringe filter (Thermo Scientific) to 
separate extracellular matrix from cells. The crude exosomes 
were then isolated by differential centrifugation method and 
subsequently purified by sucrose density gradient as previ-
ously described and resuspended in PBS, lysis buffer or dilu-
ent C (Sigma-Aldrich) for further experiments [42].
Exosomes from conditioned media of raSH-SY5Y cells 
were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation. In brief, 
50–80 million raSH-SY5Y cells were incubated with oAβ-
AF700for 3 h at 37 °C. After PBS washing, cells were kept 
for 48 h in MEM supplemented with exosome-free serum 
(System Biosciences). Culture supernatants were collected 
and spun at 1000 × g for 10 min for removal of cellular 
debris. The supernatants were then filtered through 0.22 µM 
filter and sequentially centrifuged at 5000×g, 10,000×g, and 
100,000×g. The final pellet was then resuspended in PBS, 
lysis buffer or diluent C for further analysis.
Exosomes were labelled with PKH67 or PKH26 dye 
(Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Briefly, 4 μL PKH67 dye was mixed with exosome suspen-
sion in diluent C and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The 
labelling reaction was stopped by adding 20 ml chilled PBS. 
Labelled exosomes were ultra-centrifuged at 100,000×g 
for 70 min, washed with PBS, ultra-centrifuged again at 
100,000×g and the pellet was resuspended in PBS.

Cellular uptake of exosomes
dSH-SY5Y or hiPSCs cells were plated on coverslips in the 
respective serum-free growth medium. Before the uptake 
assay, exosomes were isolated from brain tissue or condi-
tioned media of raSH-SY5Y cells and labelled with PKH67 
or PKH26 as described above. In order to use equal amounts 
of exosomes in the cell cultures, exosomal protein content 
was quantitated by using BCA (Bio-Rad) or QuantIT (Inv-
itrogen). Brain exosome abundance was quantified accord-
ing to the AChE activity (EXOCET Exosome Quantification 
kit; System Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol. The uptake was performed by incubating cell cul-
tures with 100 µl of exosome solutions (corresponding to an 
exosomal protein content of 0.62 ± 0.28 μg/μl from brain or 
0.71 ± 0.33 μg/μl from conditioned media; equal to 1.4e10 
exosome abundance from brain) in a humid chamber for 3 h 
(37 °C, 5%  
CO2). For inhibition experiments, cultured cells 
were pre-incubated for 30 min with the endocytosis inhibi-
tors, dynasore (dynamin inhibitor, 80 µM), phenylarsine 
oxide (clathrin inhibitor 20 µM), genistein (caveolae inhibi-
tor, 200 µM) all from Sigma-Aldrich. Isolated exosomes in 
PBS were added to cells for 3 h as above and flow cytometry 
was performed.
Co‑culture model
Co-culture of donor-recipient cells was performed by using 
two different methods namely the coverslip system (where 
physical contact of synapses is possible) or the transwell 
system (where physical contact of synapses is not possible). 
In both cases, donor cells (raSH-SY5Y 12,500 cells/cm2, 
or hiPSCs 25,000 cells/cm2) were seeded on glass cover-
slips coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-ornithine and 10 µg/ml 
laminin and cultured as described above for 3 h at 37 °C 
with either 1 µM of oAβ-AF700 or labelled exosomes from 
brain tissue or conditioned media, and thereafter washed 
twice with PBS.
In the transwell system, donor cells were seeded on a 
polycarbonate membrane filter with a 0.4 µm pore size (Fal-
con, Corning), placed on top of recipient cells (dSH-SY5Y) 
and subsequently co-cultured for 24 h. At the end of incuba-
tion, the membrane filter was removed and recipient cells 
were washed with PBS and analysed with flow cytometry or 
fixed with 4% PFA for immunofluorescent labelling.
In the coverslip system, the donor cells were seeded on 
glass coverslips (VWR International) and placed upside 
down on top of recipient cells, predifferentiated as described 
above (resulting in donor cells facing recipient cells) and 
subsequently co-cultured for 24 or 48 h at 37 °C. For gel 
cultured cells this results in a 3D environment. Thereafter, 
the coverslips with donor cells were removed and recipi-
ent cells were washed with PBS and either analysed with 
flow cytometry or fixed with 4% PFA for immunofluorescent 
staining. Additionally, to control for donor cell contamina-
tion in the recipient cell samples, donor cells were trans-
fected with BacMam 2.0 early endosomes Rab5a-RFP (Life 
Technologies) at a final concentration of 30 particles per cell 
before co-culture and RFP fluorescence was monitored in 
recipient cells by flow cytometry.
Immunocytochemistry
Co-localization of oAβ and flotillin-1 and TSG101 were 
visualized with immunostaining using 1: 5000 solution of 
mouse anti-mAb158, 1: 200 solution of mouse anti-flotil-
lin-1 and a 1: 200 solution of mouse anti-TSG101. The sec-
ondary antibodies were Cy3 conjugated (Jackson Immuno 
Research, 1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated (Invit-
rogen, 1:400) goat anti-mouse IgG. GFP was detected using 
1:200 rabbit anti-GFP (Life Technologies) and 1:400 goat 
anti rabbit Alexa flour 647 (Life Technologies).
Cell microscopy
Images of fixed cells were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 700 
confocal microscope. The differential interface contrast 
(DIC) mode and 405, 488, 555 and 639 lasers were used 
to acquire the images with 63x/1.40 oil immersion plan-
apochromatic DICII objectives. Live cell imaging were done 
using a Zeiss Primo Vert microscope. The micrographs were 
processed using Huygens (Scientific Volume Imaging) and 
ZEN lite (blue edition) software.
Flow cytometry
To detect PKH67 labelled exosomes or oAβ-AF700, cells 
were released from the ECM gel using Corning Recovery 
Solution (Corning) according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions, filtered through CellTrics 30 µm filters (Sysmex), 
re-suspended in PBS, and subsequently analysed on a BD 
FACSAria™ (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer.
After inhibiting the gene expression of exosome mark-
ers TSG101 and VPS4A in raSH-SY5Y cells, using RNA 
interference, the number of secreted exosomes were ana-
lysed using the Exo-Flow™ kit (System Biosciences, USA), 
targeting CD9, CD63 and CD81, as per manufacture’s 
instruction.
Enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
analysis
Altogether, 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Corning Inc.) were 
coated at 4 °C overnight with 200 ng/well of mAb158 in 
PBS. Plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin 
(BSA) in TBS. Exosome samples prepared in RIPA buffer 
 45
Acta Neuropathologica (2018) 136:41–56 
1 3
(150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium 
deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 50 mM Tris, 
pH 8.0) were added to the plates in duplicates and incu-
bated for 2 h at 37 °C. A total of 1 mg/mL of biotinylated 
mAb158 was added and incubated for 1 h at 22 °C, followed 
by 1 h at RT incubation of streptavidin-coupled poly-HRP 
(Mabtech). K-blue enhanced (ANL product, Sweden) was 
used as HRP substrate and plates were read in a spectropho-
tometer at 450 nm, using Spectra MAX 190 and then ana-
lysed with SOFT Max Pro. Wells were washed three times 
in TBST between each step. The 82E1 sandwich ELISA 
was performed same as above using 0.25 µg/ml for capture 
and detection antibody [56]. The amount of oAβ within 
exosomes was quantified with respect to a standard curve 
created with serial dilution of synthetic Aβ oligomers and 
expressed as picomolar/mg of protein.
Immunoblot analysis
Exosomes were prepared as described above. Brain lysates 
were prepared from homogenised brain tissue followed by 
addition of lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycho-
late, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM tris-HCL pH 7.5, 20 μl/
ml phosSTOP (Roche), 10 μl/ml Halt Protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific)), clarified by centrifu-
gation at 10,000 x g for 5 min and sonicated using an ultra-
sonic probe. Cell lysates were prepared from cells collected 
in lysis buffer followed by homogenisation and sonica-
tion. Samples were mixed with 4x Laemlli loading buffer 
and separated on a ClearPAGE SDS Gel 4–12% or 10% 
(C.B.S. Scientific), and transferred onto a nitrocellulose 
membrane (Invitrogen). The gel was subsequently stained 
using InstantBlue protein stain (Expedeon). Additionally, 
exosomes, isolated from Control and AD brains or condi-
tioned media of oAβ-AF700-treated raH-SY5Y cells were 
lysed by freeze-thawing and subsequently run by SEC using 
the conditions described above. The eluted proteins were 
collected in fractions of 1 ml, lyophilized, resuspended in 
15 µl PBS and spotted on 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane. 
Membranes were then blocked by 3% BSA followed by pri-
mary antibody incubation. The following antibodies were 
used: anti-flotillin-1 (1: 500, BD Transduction Laboratories); 
anti-alix (1: 1000, EMD Millipore); anti-TSG101 (1:1000, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific); 1:1000, anti-VPS4A (Abcam), 
anti-calnexin (1:1000, Abcam), anti-synaptophysin (1:1000, 
Synaptic Systems), mAb158 (1: 5000/10000, BioArctic) and 
anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 
1:40000, Synaptic Systems,). Anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody (1:3000, Dako) and anti-
mouse IgG, HRP-linked antibody (1:3000, Dako) were used 
as secondary antibodies. The blots were visualized using 
Amersham™ ECL™ (GE Health Care) or  
SuperSignal® 
(Thermo Scientific) detection systems and analysed by 
ImageJ software.
Negative staining and transmission electron 
microscopy of exosomes
Exosome suspensions were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
(at 1:1 dilution, for a final paraformaldehyde concentration 
of 2%) overnight at 4 °C and stored at − 20 °C until use. 
Thawed exosome suspensions were vortexed briefly and 
centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 30 s. Exosomes were 
adsorbed on Formvar-coated Ni mesh grids by placing the 
grids on 5 µl drops of exosome suspension for 20 min in a 
dry chamber. Negative staining was performed by gently 
dripping 100 µl 2% aqueous uranyl acetate onto the grid, 
followed by removal of excess uranyl acetate solution using 
a lens paper. The grids were examined in a JEOL JEM-1230 
electron microscope at 100 kV accelerating voltage. Electron 
micrographs were obtained at 150,000–200,000 × magnifica-
tion, for a final image scale of 3.1–4.2 pixels/nm.
Tunable resistive pulse sensing by qNano
Exosome size and particle number were analysed by TRPS 
analysis using a qNano instrument (IZON Science, UK) as 
described previously [37]. First, isolated exosomes from 
brain tissue or conditioned media of dSH-SY5Y cells were 
diluted and passed through a 0.2 μm filter (Millipore). Sub-
sequently, particle numbers were counted for a maximum of 
5 min or until 500 particles had been counted, using 8 mbar 
pressure and the NP150 or NP100 nanopore membranes with 
a stretch between 45 and 47 mm. Voltage was set to 0.1 and 
0.25 mV to achieve a stable current. Particle size histograms 
were recorded when root mean square noise was below 13 
pA and particle rate in time was linear. Calibration was per-
formed using known concentration of beads CPC70D (mode 
diameter 70 nm) or CPC100B (mode diameter: 110 nm) (all 
from IZON) diluted in 1:500 0.2 μm filtered PBS.
Proteinase K digestion
To examine whether exosome-associated Aβ is luminal 
or bound to the exterior exosome surface, exosomes were 
isolated from conditioned media (oAβAF700-treated) of 
dSH-SY5Y cells and incubated with proteinase K (Sigma-
Aldrich,1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. 4-(2-aminoethyl)-
benzene-sulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.5 mM) was 
subsequently added to the vesicle fraction to inactivate the 
enzyme prior to two rounds of 100,000 × g centrifugation. 
The final pellet was resuspended in PBS and AF700 fluores-
cence was measured in Tecan Safire2 microplate reader at 
Ex/Em 696/719 nm.

Cytotoxicity assay
To investigate the toxic effect of exosomes on neurons, equal 
amounts of exosomes (based on exosomal protein estimation 
by BCA) from brains or cells were added to dSH-SY5Y cells 
and hiPSCs in our co-culture model for 48 h, as described 
above. At the end of incubation, donor cells were removed 
and cell medium was collected to assess the release of lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) in the medium. Collected medium 
was centrifuged 2000×g for 5 min at 4 °C and LDH assay 
(Pierce) was performed according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The absorbance was measured in a microplate reader 
(SpectraMAX 190) at 490 nm with subsequent blank at 
680 nm. Furthermore, XTT (2,3-bis [2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-
sulfophenyl]-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium 
hydroxide) assay using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche 
Diagnostics GmbH) was performed on acceptor cells accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reduced XTT 
product produced by mitochondrial enzymes in viable cells, 
formazan (bright orange in colour) was measured after 8 h 
of incubation at 450 and 750 nm using a Victor 3 V 1420 
multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). Both LDH and XTT 
values were presented as percentage of untreated control.
RNA interference
Cells were seeded at a density of 12 500 cells/cm2 in a 
6-well plate and transfected 24 h later with TSG101 or VPS4 
mRNA-targeting siRNA or a non-targeting siRNA with no 
homology to any known human gene (All Stars Negative

tions in the culture medium ranged from 10 to 20 nmol/l. 
Twenty-four hours after transfection, knockdown was veri-
fied by quantitative real-time PCR and Western Blot analy-
ses, and a decrease in the mRNA level of 70% or greater was 
considered sufficient downregulation.
Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qia-
gen), and cDNA was obtained with the High Capacity 
RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems). The expression 
levels of TSG101 or VPS4 mRNA were analysed with a 
7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system and FAM/MGB probes 
(Applied Biosystems) to confirm downregulation after 
siRNA treatment. All reactions were performed according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. GAPDH was amplified as 
an internal standard. The data were calculated according to 
the comparative Ct method to present the data as fold differ-
ences in the expression levels relative to the control sample.
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad 
Prism Software. Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM, 
and statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed 
unpaired Student’s t tests with Welch’s correction or one-
way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction. Every batch of cell 
cultures was treated as one independent experiment (n = 1). 
P values less than or equal to 0.05 were deemed statistically 
significant.
Study approval
The collection and use of post mortem brain tissue was 
approved by the Regional Ethical Committee in Uppsala, 
Sweden (2005/103, 2005-06-29; 2009/089; 2009-04-22). 
The process of reprogramming human cells was approved 
by the Ethical Committee at Karolinska Institute, Sweden 
(dnr 2012/208-31/3 with addendum 2012/856-32). A written 
informed consent was received from all donors.
Results
Alzheimer brain exosomes are enriched with oAβ
To examine whether oAβ has the potential to localize to cel-
lular structures that form exosomes in the AD brain we ana-
lysed the co-localization of potential oAβ labelling and the 
marker flotillin-1, expressed in multi-vesicular bodies and 
exosomes. Brain sections from temporal neocortex from four 
post mortem AD brains were double-immunostained with 
flotillin-1 and one of two different Aβ antibodies (mAb158 
or 82E1). Cells with neuronal morphology displayed both 
mAb158 or 82E1 and flotillin-1 labelling (Fig. 1a, b). Next, 
the possible co-localization of mAb158 or 82E1 with flotil-
lin-1 was analysed on immunofluorescently labelled, fixed 
brain sections using the same antibodies. Although the reso-
lution is not sufficient to prove co-localization, we observed 
a strong correlation between mAb158 or 82E1 and flotillin-1 
labelling, suggesting a subcellular co-localization (Fig. 1c, 
d) (R2 = 0.78 and 0.86 for mAb158 and 82E1, respectively). 
The detected fluorescence was not due to lipofuscin-derived 
autofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Currently, no 
antibodies with verified oAβ selectivity in IHC applications 
have been reported. Thus, we selected the two Aβ antibod-
ies with most extensive data on oligomer selectivity in other

assays (mainly ELISA). Both these antibodies showed 
similar labelling patterns in brain tissue (Fig. 1a–d). Fur-
thermore, our findings from dot-blot (Fig. 1k, m, described 
below) supports that mAb158 has a selectivity for aggre-
gates over monomers also in assays where the protein is 
in a bound state. Taken together, these data indicate that 
the identified Aβ labelling likely represents oligomeric Aβ 
aggregates. Thus, our findings suggest an association of 
oAβ with intracellular compartments containing flotillin-1, 
including multivesicular bodies, in the human AD brain, 
which thus suggests that oAß could be released in exosomes.
Since oAβ is believed to be central to AD pathophysi-
ology [50], we postulated that exosomes from AD brains 
would contain higher concentrations of oAβ when com-
pared to similar preparations of control brain samples from 
patients deceased from non-neurological reasons. Using 
well-established methods for mild dissociation of nerv-
ous tissue followed by separation of extracellular matrix 
from cells we were able to isolate exosomes by sequential

ultracentrifugation from fresh-frozen, post mortem brain tis-
sues from temporal neocortex of both AD and control sub-
jects. Analyses of the isolated fractions by Tunable Resis-
tive Pulse Sensing technology (TRPS, qNano system) and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Supplementary 
Fig. S1b, c) demonstrated presence of vesicles with a size 
corresponding to exosomes [55]. Immunoblotting confirmed 
the extracellular origin of the extracted vesicles by presence 
of the exosomal markers alix and flotillin-1 and the lack of 
the cellular marker calnexin and the synapse vesicle marker 
synaptophysin (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, immunoblotting con-
firms the presence of exosomal markers in extracted vesi-
cles from both control and AD brains (Fig. 1f). As immu-
nostaining of flotillin-1 and oAβ in the AD brain sections 
does not have the sufficient resolution, ELISA, which is 
a more quantitative method, was implemented to demon-
strate the oAβ in brain exosomes. When used as capture and 
target in an ELISA the Aβ antibodies mAb158 is selective 
for Aβ oligomers [19, 57], while 82E1 detects both soluble 
and fibril Aβ [31]. Interestingly, ELISA with either one of 
these two oligomer-selective antibodies showed significantly 
higher levels of oAß in exosomes from AD brains (n = 5, 
3.12 ± 0.93 pM oAß/mg protein for 82E1 and 7.69 ± 1.68 pM 
oAß/mg protein for mAb158) than in those from healthy 
control brains (n = 5, 0.46 ± 0.30 pM oAß/mg protein for 
82E1 and 2.66 ± 0.74 pM oAß/mg protein for mAb158) 
(Fig. 1g, h). There was no significant difference in the 
amount of flotillin-1 in exosomes derived from AD or con-
trol brain tissue of equivalent weight (Fig. 1i). The increase 
in exosomal oAß was not an effect of co-precipitation of 
free oAß during the extraction as spiking exosomes with 
exogenous oAß did not result in increased levels, which 
also implies that association of oAß with exosomes occurs 
intracellularly (Supplementary Fig. S1e). Additionally, the 
presence of oAβ in isolated exosomes was further assessed 
using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC chroma-
tograms of the isolated and lysed exosomes from control 
and AD brain samples were analysed at 215 nm absorbance 
(general protein detection) and proteins were detected in the 
void volume (first peak) as well as in fractions correspond-
ing to lower molecular weight (Fig. 1j). The presence of 
oAβ in the different SEC eluate fractions was further inves-
tigated by dot-blot analysis using mAb158. This confirmed 
that exosomes isolated from AD brain samples contained 
oAβ in SEC fractions running at the oligomer size that 
was not detected in control brain (Fig. 1k). Similarly, lysed 
exosomes isolated from conditioned media of control- or 
oAβ-AF700 treated neuronally differentiated neuroblas-
toma cells (dSH-SY5Y) as well as pure oAβ-AF700 were 
analysed on SEC chromatograms with detection at 700 nm 
absorbance (AF700 detection). This shows absorbance 
peaks (oligomeric and monomeric) at the same time points 
(size) for exosomes from conditioned media of oAβ-AF700 
treated cells as for the pure oAβ-AF700 initially used to treat 
the cells (Fig. 1l). oAβ was detected only in fractions from 
exosomes from conditioned media of oAβ-AF700 treated 
dSH-SY5Y cells and not in control cell exosomes (Fig. 1m). 
Furthermore, these findings show that, in addition to previ-
ously shown Aβ oligomer selectivity in ELISA assay [19, 
57], the mAb158 antibody is oligomer selective also in an 
assay where protein is not free floating.
The localization of oAß to exosomes was further inves-
tigated in neuronal cell models. dSH-SY5Y or hiPSC were 
incubated with oAβ-AF700 for 3 h, after 48 h exosomes were 
isolated from the conditioned media by sequential ultracen-
trifugation. Similar to the brain extractions, the isolated vesi-
cles were characterized as exosomes using immunoblotting 
for the exosome markers, alix and flotillin-1, lack of cellular 
marker calnexin and synapse vesicle marker synaptophysin, 
TRPS and TEM (Supplementary Fig. S2a–d) [35, 54]. To 
investigate the location of oAß, exosomes isolated from con-
ditioned media from oAß-AF700 treated retinoic acid dif-
ferentiated SH-SY5Y cells (raSH-SY5Y) were treated with 
proteinase K (1 mg/ml) to digest proteins on the surface, 
confirming that the localization of oAβ is mainly luminal 
as this did not significantly decrease exosomal oAβAF700 
(Supplementary Fig. S2e).
Exosomes from AD brain are internalized 
and transferred by neurons, causing cytotoxicity
To investigate whether exosomes could be a vehicle for the 
spreading of oAß, we investigated if exosomes isolated from 
Fig. 2  Exosome-mediated uptake and propagation of oAβ in neu-
ronal cells. Exosomes isolated from brain tissue or conditioned 
media of dSH-SY5Y cells were labelled with the dye PKH67 and 
added to donor hiPSCs or dSH-SY5Y cells. After 3 h of incubation 
at 37 °C, donor cells were fixed, stained with mAb158 (for brain 
exosomes) and analysed by confocal microscopy or donor cells were 
co-cultured with another set of hiPSCs or dSH-SY5Y (recipient 
cells). After 48 h of co-culture, donor cells were removed and recipi-
ent cells were fixed, stained with mAb158 (for brain exosomes) and 
analysed by confocal microscopy. a A cartoon illustrating the co-
culture model with hiPSC or dSH-SY5Y cells employed to measure

AD brains could be taken up by hiPSCs and dSH-SY5Y cells 
(Fig. 2a). The cells were incubated with exosomes (PKH67 
labelled) isolated from brain tissue. After 3 h, both exosomes 
(Fig. 2b) and oAß (mAb158, Fig. 2c) had been taken up by 
the cells. Using a co-culture system with hiPSCs or dSH-
SY5Y cells, previously shown to result in synaptically con-
nected neurons [40], we next investigated the possible trans-
fer of brain-derived exosomal oAß between these neurons. 
When RFP labelled donor cells that had been exposed to 
exosomes were placed on top of recipient neurons for 48 h, 
a substantial number of transferred exosomes (PKH67) and 
oAβ (mAb158) could be detected in both types of recipi-
ent cells (Fig. 2d, e). Moreover, transferred oAß was still 
partly co-localized with PKH67 labelled exosomes in the 
recipient cells, suggesting that after being internalized part 
of the exosomes can be transferred onwards, still intact with 
their oAß content. Similarly, uptake of oAß in raSH-SY5Y 
treated with oAβ-AF700 (3 h) resulted in a co-localization 
with intracellular flotillin-1 and TSG101 (Supplementary 
Fig. S3a-b). Isolated (48 h conditioned media) and labelled 
(PKH67) exosomes were readily taken up by new cells. A 
high degree of internalization of exosomes in either dSH-
SY5Y (Fig. 2f) or hiPSC (Fig. 2g) cells was observed. These 
vesicular structures had a mainly perinuclear localization 
and many of them were positive for oAβ-AF700. Using 
these secondary neurons as donor cells and co-culturing 
them with a new set of dSH-SY5Y recipient cells for 24 h 
showed further spread of AF700 labelled oAβ to this third 
set of cells (red channel, Fig. 2h). Similarly to what we 
observed for exosomes from AD brains, we could detect a 
substantial fraction of oAβ that was still co-localized with 
exosomes (merged, Fig. 2h). These findings support that, 
apart from releasing their cargo, intact exosomes also can 
carry and transfer oAβ further to new recipient cells. Like-
wise, exosomes isolated from conditioned media from cells 
that had not been exposed to oAβ were also taken up by 
cells and transferred onwards (Supplementary Fig. S3c), 
corroborating that the release and uptake of exosomes per 
se is not dependent on the presence of oAß. To confirm that 
the observed PKH labelling is not due to artefacts we used 
the supernatant from the last ultracentrifugation wash-step 
of the exosome isolation from brain or conditioned media, 
respectively. The supernatant was labelled with PKH67 
using the same protocol as for labelling the exosomes. The 
labelled sample were subsequently added to raSH-SY5Y 
cells. Contrary to the exosome fraction the exosome-free 
fraction did not result in any labelling in the cells either in 
brain (Fig. 2i) or conditioned media extracts (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S3d). Furthermore, isolated exosomes from CD63-
GFP expressing raSH-SY5Y cells were double-labelled with 
PKH26 (red) and added to raSH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2j). This 
confirmed that the exosomes studied here are not artefacts, 
but indeed exosomes.
Further evidence for the exosomal transportation of oAβ 
was obtained by using a transwell co-culture model after 
uptake of oAβ containing exosomes to donor cells. Also, 
in this model oAβ transferred to recipient cells, suggesting 
vesicle transfer of oAβ between cells without direct neuritic 
connections. However, compared to the coverslip co-culture 
model significantly less neurons containing transfer of oAβ 
was detected in the transwell model, a decrease from 23.60 
to 5.18% as analysed by flow cytometry and illustrated by 
confocal imaging (Supplementary Fig. S4a, b). Thus, sug-
gesting that transfer is more efficient between cells in prox-
imity, which could potentially depend on multiple mecha-
nisms of transfer.
Next, we investigated if the spread of exosomes and their 
oAß cargo could result in neuronal toxicity. Isolated brain 
exosomes (equalized by protein amounts) from either control 
or AD brains were added to dSH-SY5Y cells for 3 h, these 
cells were used as donor cells in 48 h co-culture with recipi-
ent dSH-SY5Y cells. The recipient cells were subsequently 
investigated for morphological changes compared to control 
co-culture with untreated donor cells (Fig. 3a). As described 
previously [2] the control dSH-SY5Y shows neuronal mor-
phology with long, branching networks of neurites. Similar 
morphology was seen in recipient cells in the control brain 
exosome conditions. Occasional changes in neurite mor-
phology could be identified. Interestingly, more pronounced 
pathology was seen in recipient cells co-cultured with AD 
brain exosome treated donor cells. Here dystrophic neur-
ites with neurite beading and loss of neurite branching were 
identified, known early signs of neurodegeneration [51]. We 
quantified these effects further and notably, we found that 
the transfer of AD brain exosomes induced significant cyto-
toxicity compared to control brain exosomes, as assessed by 
the degree of membrane leakage of lactate dehydrogenase 
enzyme (LDH) from the recipient hiPSC and dSH-SY5Y 
cells (Fig. 3b, c). Induced cellular toxicity was also detected 
by XTT (2,3-bis [2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-5-
[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide) analy-
sis in both cell types (Fig. 3d, e). Similar toxicity was further 
seen after treatment with exosomes from conditioned oAß 
media (Fig. 5d). In addition, exosomes from control brains 
which should contain significantly less oAß, caused toxicity 
in hiPSCs but not in dSH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3b, e). No toxic-
ity was seen after treatment with exosomes from conditioned 
media from cells not treated with oAβ (Supplementary Fig. 
S5a). Taken together, these results suggest that intact AD 
brain exosomes, carrying oAβ, are taken up by neurons and 
migrate to second order neurons where they can release their 
cargo and cause cytotoxicity.

Inhibition of exosome formation and secretion 
inhibit the spread of oAβ
If exosomes are capable of transferring oAß between neu-
rons, it should be possible to stop this transfer by inhibiting 
the formation of exosomes. As previously shown, biogen-
esis of exosomes and its cargo proteins can be modulated 
by knocking down two Endosomal Sorting Complexes 
Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins, TSG101 and 
VPS4A, required for exosome formation and secretion, 
respectively [3, 18, 21, 30]. By using siRNA oligonucleo-
tides, a significant decrease in the mRNA levels (decreased 
in average with 90% for TSG101 and 88% for VPS4A), 
protein levels (decreased in average with 87% for TSG101 
and 65% for VPS4A) and the number of secreted exosomes 
(decreased in average with 95% for TSG101 and 76% for 
VPS4A) (Fig. 4a–c) was achieved. The siRNA treatment 
did not affect viability, as analyses showed that > 95% of 
the cells were viable as measured by XTT assay (Fig. 4d). 
To distinguish between different mechanisms of transfer, we 
again used the coverslip and transwell co-culture models 
and quantified the oAβ transfer in presence of TSG101 or 
VPS4A siRNA in our co-culture model using flow-cytome-
try. Interestingly, upon inhibition of exosome formation and 
secretion the oAβ transfer was almost completely blocked in 
the transwell model, whereas almost half of the oAβ transfer 
could be stopped in the coverslip model (Fig. 4e). These 
results indicate that exosomes are largely responsible for the 
neuron-to-neuron transfer of oAβ, although other mecha-
nisms of transfer may also be involved.

AD brain exo
Fig. 3  Transfer of AD brain exosomes causes cytotoxicity. Exosomes 
isolated from control and AD brain tissues were added to donor hiP-
SCs or dSH-SY5Y cells. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, donor cells 
were washed with PBS and co-cultured with another set of hiPSCs 
or dSH-SY5Y (recipient cells). After 48 h of co-culture, donor cells 
were removed. a Morphological changes assessed in recipient dSH-
SY5Y showing loss of neurite branching after transfer of AD brain 
exosomes. Also, neurite beading was seen in dystrophic neurites as 
shown in magnified insert. The conditioned media was collected for 
LDH assay (b, c) and recipient cell viability evaluated by XTT (d, e). 
Values are expressed as percentage of untreated control. Values are

The uptake of exosomes and spread of oAß 
is dynamin‑dependent and can be blocked
After being released, the exosomes can be taken up by the 
recipient cells via different mechanisms. In dSH-SY5Y 
cells the uptake of isolated exosomes observed at 37 °C, as 
described above, was completely abrogated at 4 °C (Supple-
mentary Fig. S5b). Thus, the exosomal uptake is an active 
process. Neuronal cells are capable of different modes of 
endocytosis, ranging from receptor-mediated and clathrin-
dependent, to independent endocytosis [10, 34, 47]. To 
explore the uptake mechanism, we treated dSH-SY5Y cells 
with isolated, PKH67 labelled, exosomes together with vari-
ous inhibitors of endocytosis: dynasore (dynamin inhibitor), 
phenylarsine oxide (clathrin inhibitor) and genistein (cave-
olae inhibitor). Treatment with phenylarsine oxide caused 
minor cellular toxicity, while no notable cellular toxicity was 
observed upon treatment with dynasore or genistein (Sup-
plementary Fig. S5c). Strikingly, all three inhibitors caused 
a significant decrease in the proportion of cells that took 
up exosomes as quantified by flow-cytometry; the decrease 
was 97.7% with dynasore, 66.5% with phenylarsine oxide 
and 76.0% with genistein. Thus, the effect was most marked 
with dynasore treatment, which almost completely abolished 
the uptake of exosomes (Fig. 5a), while having only minor 
effect on the internalization of oAβ added directly to the 
medium (Fig. 5b). This observation supports that the uptake 
of exosomes, and thus also oAß transferred via this route, is 
regulated by dynamin.
The dependence on dynamin, and thus exosomes, for 
the spread of oAß between neurons was further confirmed 
using dSH-SY5Y cells in the transwell model using donor 
cells fed with exosomes, isolated from conditioned media 
(oAβ-AF700 treated raSH-SY5Y cells). In this setting with 
an absence of direct neuritic connections, oAβ transfer was 
almost completely blocked by dynamin inhibition (Fig. 5c), 
in line with a major dependence on exosomes for transfer. 
When instead performing the same experiment using the 
coverslip co-culture model, allowing for direct cell-to-cell 
contacts, there was also a significant decrease of transferred 
oAß (Fig. 5c). Since our observations substantiate the 
hypothesis that exosomes play a significant role in trans-
ferring oAβ from one neuron to another, we next sought 
to investigate whether transfer of exosomes containing oAβ 
had any direct toxic effect on the recipient cells. Cell-to-
cell transfer of exosomes, isolated from conditioned media

(oAβ-AF700 treated raSH-SY5Y cells), showed a significant 
increase in cellular toxicity of 26% in the recipient cell, as 
evident by LDH assay (Fig. 5d). Exosomes from untreated 
raSH-SY5Y cells had no significant toxic effect on the recip-
ient cells (Supplementary Fig. S5a). Importantly, we found 
that such induced toxicity could be abolished by blocking the 
transfer of exosomes using dynasore (Fig. 5d). These data 
provide proof-of-concept that the transfer of exosomes and 
oAβ together with subsequent toxicity, can be prevented by 
inhibiting the dynamin-dependent uptake pathway.
Discussion
Recent evidence suggests that toxic Aβ aggregates can 
spread pathology in the Alzheimer brain. The nature of the 
propagating species has not been established, although sev-
eral studies have indicated a particularly pathogenic role of 
soluble oAβ on synaptic and cellular functions and structure 
[13, 32, 50, 60]. It has been speculated that exosomes might 
transfer neurodegenerative proteins in the affected brain [28]. 
Accordingly, exosomes from blood [22], CSF [17, 49] and 
cell cultures [46] have been shown to contain monomeric 
Aβ and tau, but so far, no study has addressed the presence 
of oAβ in exosomes from human AD brains. In this study, 
we could show that AD brain exosomes contain an increased 
amount of oAβ compared to non-neurological control brains 
and found evidence that exosomes can be responsible for 
the neuron-to-neuron transfer of toxic oAβ. These findings 
suggest that exosomes might be the main mediator of the 
pathogenic progression in AD as was recently suggested for 
dementia with Lewy bodies [41]. In addition, we found a 
co-localization between oAβ and exosomes inside neurons, 
which might indicate that exosomes play a role in Aβ sort-
ing and oligomerization [16]. The AD brain exosomes were 
further shown to effectively transfer oAβ from one neuron 
to another, with subsequent toxic effects on the recipient 
cells. Interestingly, at least a part of the exosomes seems 
to be transferred intact to further cells, consistent with a 
recent study showing that a substantial fraction of exosomes 
internalized in one cell were subsequently passed on to a 
second cell [44]. Importantly, there is increasing evidence of 
correlations between intra-neuronal oAβ and cell death [43]. 
We have previously demonstrated that transfer of oAβ causes

the proportion of cells with uptake was quantified by flow cytome-

neurotoxicity [40] which has also been shown with Aß con-
taining exosomes isolated from AD CSF [33]. Accordingly, 
we now found signs of neurotoxicity both morphologically 
and with the LDH and the XTT assays after transfer of 
exosomes carrying oAβ. This observation not only rein-
forces the role of intracellular oAβ in AD pathogenesis but 
also establishes the disease relevance associated with the 
exosomal neuron-to-neuron transfer of intercellular oAβ.
The molecular content of exosomes is a fingerprint of 
the releasing cell type and, because of their small size, 
neuronal exosomes are released into accessible body fluids 
such as blood and CSF [48]. Since neuronal exosomes dis-
play unique neuron-specific surface markers [22, 26] they 
may be a valuable biomedical marker for early diagnosis 
and treatment in AD. Indeed, exosomes have recently been 
highlighted as diagnostic biomarkers in various disease con-
ditions, including AD [29, 36]. In concordance, the finding 
of increased levels of oAβ in brain exosomes opens the pos-
sibility that similar features could be detected also in eas-
ily accessible body fluids, such as plasma and CSF. Hence, 
measurement of increased oAβ in exosomes from such 
patient samples could potentially serve as a diagnostic tool.
The intercellular propagation of oAβ and its ensuing 
toxicity could also serve as a potential treatment target by 
inhibiting either formation, secretion, or cellular uptake of 
exosomes. Indeed, downregulation of TSG101 and VPS4A, 
proteins necessary for exosome formation and secretion, 
was found to result in decreased release of exosomes and 
a reduced subsequent transfer of oAβ, thus supporting the 
possibility of modulating this mechanism. Moreover, these 
observations are in line with recent studies showing that 
interfering with exosome release can impact the release of 
specific proteins [9, 14]. An alternative therapeutic target 
could be the dynamin-dependent uptake of exosomes [23, 
24] as the dynamin inhibitor dynasore decreased exosome 
propagation, spread of oAβ and the associated neuronal tox-
icity, leading to rescued cell viability. Dynasore itself would 
not be a feasible therapeutic substance, but phenothiazine-
derived antipsychotic drugs have been suggested to inhibit 
dynamin dependent endocytosis [11] and could thus be suit-
able for further drug development.
In conclusion, our results point to a role for exosomes 
in the spreading of toxic oAβ and the associated disease 
progression in the AD brain (summarized in Supplemen-
tary Fig. S6). It has been suggested that exosomal release 
may provide an alternative disposal mechanism to lysoso-
mal degradation of oAβ [5] or other proteins that are resist-
ant to degradation [55]. We speculate that this alternative 
mechanism of clearance, which initially could be beneficial 
for the cells, over time becomes a liability with increased 
propagation of pathological proteins throughout the brain. 
The possibility of inhibiting exosome transfer and the related 
spread and toxicity of oAβ may lead to the identification of 
new pharmaceutical targets for AD.
