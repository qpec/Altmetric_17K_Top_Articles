Abstract
Background
Research exploring internet use and self-harm is rapidly expanding amidst concerns regard-
ing influences of on-line activities on self-harm and suicide, especially in young people. We
aimed to systematically review evidence regarding the potential influence of the internet on
self-harm/suicidal behaviour in young people.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review based on an electronic search for articles published
between 01/01/2011 and 26/01/2015 across databases including Medline, Cochrane and
PsychInfo. Articles were included if: the study examined internet use by individuals who
engaged in self-harm/ suicidal behaviour, or internet use clearly related to self-harm content;
reported primary empirical data; participants were aged under 25 years. New studies were
combined with those identified in a previous review and subject to data extraction, quality
rating and narrative synthesis.
Results
Forty-six independent studies (51 articles) of varying quality were included. Perceived influ-
ences were: positive for 11 studies (38191 participants); negative for 18 studies (119524
participants); and mixed for 17 studies (35235 participants). In contrast to previous reviews
on this topic studies focused on a wide range of internet mediums: general internet use;
internet addiction; online intervention/treatment; social media; dedicated self-harm web-
sites; forums; video/image sharing and blogs. A relationship between internet use and self-
harm/suicidal behaviour was particularly associated with internet addiction, high levels of
internet use, and websites with self-harm or suicide content. While there are negative

 aspects of internet use the potential for isolation reduction, outreach and as a source of help
and therapy were also identified.
Conclusions
There is significant potential for harm from online behaviour (normalisation, triggering, com-
petition, contagion) but also the potential to exploit its benefits (crisis support, reduction of
social isolation, delivery of therapy, outreach). Young people appear to be increasingly
using social media to communicate distress, particularly to peers. The focus should now be
on how specific mediums’ (social media, video/image sharing) might be used in therapy and
recovery. Clinicians working with young people who self-harm or have mental health issues
should engage in discussion about internet use. This should be a standard item during
assessment.

Introduction
Internet use has a mixed effect on children and young people’s (CYP) well-being, with evi-
dence of increased self-esteem and perceived social support alongside harmful effects such as
increased exposure to graphic content and cyber-bullying [1]. High profile cases of cyber-bul-
lying and suicide over the past decade [2] and reports of suicide clusters facilitated by social
media [3] have resulted in researchers increasingly focusing efforts on understanding the rela-
tionship between internet use and both self-harm and suicide. An early review examining the
use of dedicated self-harm support sites in young people found high levels of support available
online alongside normalisation of self-harm behaviour [4]. A more recent systematic review
relating to self-harm and internet use in young people additionally found evidence of informa-
tion sharing of methods of self-harm and concealment, a reduced sense of isolation and rein-
forcement of positive behaviours such as help seeking [5]. The authors concluded that the
internet exerts both positive and negative influences on self-harm and provides an opportunity
for intervention, which is supported by several more recent studies [6, 7].
While research appears to be beginning to answer some questions regarding the role of the
internet for young people who self-harm a number of questions remain unanswered. Authors
of the previous review highlighted that research to the date of their review (26th December
2011) described internet use only in relation to use of forums or general use [5]. This is an
important limitation since specific internet pathways may represent increased risk. Internet
addiction and pro-suicide websites have been suggested as high risk factors facilitating suicidal
behaviours, particularly in isolated and susceptible individuals [8]. Additionally, a recent study
examining changes in online suicide-related content showed that the results of searches for
self-harm have changed over time, with an increasing presence of graphic imagery [6]. The
role of such images has been examined in relation to self-harming behaviours [9], as well as
relevant content of videos on a popular sharing website [10]. A recent study has also showed
that the nature of sites returned varied according to the suicide/self-harm-related search terms
use and almost half contain video content. Negative influences such as providing information
on methods, encouraging self-harm behaviours and images considered evocative by research-
ers were common. However, more positive influences including advice on how to seek help

 was given on over half of identified sites [7]. Further research has highlighted the positive and
negative influences of the internet, the potential benefit of directing individuals to healthier
online behaviour and the discrepancy in perspectives regarding online activities between ado-
lescent culture and that of many mental health professionals [11].
The previous review also identified a possible relationship between study design and per-
ceived outcome. Qualitative and mixed methods studies tended to report a positive influence
of internet use and quantitative designs tended to find a negative impact. Therefore the design
and quality of individual studies may have had an impact on perceived outcomes. Following
their systematic review [5] the authors highlighted the need for more rigorous research to clar-
ify the positive and negative influences and to focus on the mediating and moderating factors
in order to optimise the benefits whilst minimising the potential harm of internet use in young
people who self-harm.
The primary aim of this study was to systematically review all research relating to the poten-
tial influence of the internet on self-harm/suicidal behaviour in young people, with a particular
focus on identifying the factors which determine whether the internet is perceived as positive
or negative in its potential influence.
Method
Search strategy and selection criteria
This study was a systematic review. The previous electronic literature search, conducted by
some of the authors, was up to 26th December 2011 [5]. For the present review, an electronic lit-
erature search was conducted (AM) for all articles published between 1st January 2011 and 26th
January 2015. A range of databases were searched including: CINAHL; Cochrane Library;
EMBASE (excluding Medline journals); HMIC; Medline; NICE; Prospero; PsycINFO; PubMed;
SCOPUS. Additional searches were conducted in health improvement sources, topic specific
websites (American Association of Suicidology, British Psychological Society, CEBMH, Centre
for Mental Health, DH, DHSPSS-NI, MFH, NHS Scotland, Royal College of Psychiatrists,
Welsh Government) and meta-search engines (Google/ Google scholar) for these dates only.
The search terms employed in the original review (which included ‘Self harm’, ‘Suicid�,
‘Internet’, ‘Children’, ‘Young People’) were updated to account for the rapidly changing nature
of the internet and memes (an image, piece of text, idea that spreads rapidly) in young people.
The full details of search terms and sources searched are included in S1 Table. Reference lists
of all review articles were manually screened for potential eligible papers. The research team
included a number of experts in the field who reviewed searches for any potentially unidenti-
fied citations. Experts in the field were also contacted to assist in identification of literature.
These included those known to members of the team and others identified from existing litera-
ture. They were contacted by email regarding any additional studies and, where relevant, data
or full text copies of articles were also requested by email.
Articles were included if they examined internet use by individuals who experienced sui-
cidal ideation, self-harm, or internet use which was clearly related to self-harm content. Any
type of online media or activity was considered for inclusion. We included articles that pre-
sented primary empirical data and were published in journals. Participants had either to all be
aged less than 25 years or have a mean age of 25 years or less. If ages were not stated, partici-
pants had to be described as children, adolescents or young adults. Where articles examined
more than one age group, only data for the age group fitting these criteria were analysed.
Results were not restricted on the basis of location; however, only English language papers
were included.

 In order to be consistent with the previous review [5] review articles, news articles, single
case studies, editorials, comments, conference abstracts and other grey literature, while
searched for (e.g. CINAHL, HMIC), were not included in the final analysis. While the inclu-
sion of grey literature can reduce the impact of publication bias, it may also introduce its own
set of biases. These include the absence of peer review and the potential that the availability of
data would impact on overall results [12]. Included articles from the previous review on this
topic 1991–2011 [5] were added to the newly identified eligible articles to provide a complete
overview of available evidence. Studies relating to cyber-bullying and self-harm from both the
new and existing literature were excluded and will be reviewed in a separate report. This deci-
sion was taken due to the number of known quantitative studies related to this specific topic
and because it would allow for a more thorough discussion of the literature with the potential
for meta-analysis (protocol available from http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_
record.asp?src=trip&ID=CRD42017056487).
Two independent reviewers (AJ, AM) manually screened titles. Any disagreements were
resolved by consensus. Titles that clearly had no relevance, book chapters, case reports, confer-
ence abstracts, comments, editorial, journal notes, grey literature and news sources were
excluded at title screen, although reference lists were manually screened for relevant studies. A
record was kept of all discarded articles, including the reason for exclusion. Duplicates were
removed. The remaining titles with abstracts were then screened for eligibility by the same two
researchers. Full text articles were obtained where suitability could not be determined based
on the title and abstract. Two researchers independently reviewed the remaining citations (AJ,
AM). Any disagreements that could not be resolved through consensus were discussed with a
third expert reviewer (KH).
A protocol for this review was registered with the PROSPERO systematic review protocol
registry (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42015019518)
Data analysis
The data extraction sheet from the previous review [5] was adapted and used to record specific
findings from both newly identified articles and those from the previous review (S2 Table).
Additional fields were added to account for the greater level of detail in more recent research
articles and to allow comparison of internet medium, outcome measured and study design.
Studies were divided between four reviewers (AM, NP, AS, VS) and pairs of reviewers’ indepen-
dently extracted data for each study. Any inconsistencies in data extraction and quality scores
were clarified by consensus with at least two study authors. Articles were amalgamated and
grouped according to internet medium studied and perceived influence. Positive influences
were defined as results indicating perceived reduction of psychological distress, reduced suicidal
ideation and self-harm, advice on how to seek help and encouragement to do so. Negative influ-
ences were defined as results indicating: increased psychological distress, self-harm or suicidal
ideation; information on methods of self-harm/suicide was provided; self-harm behaviours
were encouraged. Mixed influences were recorded where a report included both positive and
negative influences. Internet media were grouped according to their stated description within
articles. These media categories were inductively generated following initial reading and data
extraction of papers and were cross checked by two members of the study team (AM and AJ).
Quality of included articles was assessed according to the Critical Appraisal Skills Pro-
gramme (CASP) [13] as performed previously [5]. This tool assesses various aspects of study
design including the study sampled, data collection methods, study design and the clarity and
appropriateness of results and conclusions. It also includes items related to potential sources of
bias such as from the study population or design.

 Due to the range of research questions, methods used, populations and outcomes studied
there was a high level of clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies, precluding
any meaningful combination of study results through meta-analysis. Therefore, a narrative
synthesis was employed. Based on published guidance [14] this narrative synthesis examined a
number of key aspects. Comparisons across studies were made regarding the way in which the
relationship between self-harm/suicide and internet use had been identified and analysed; rela-
tionships between study results were examined and compared across the studies; the influence
of heterogeneity was further explored including theoretical variables, differences in baseline
characteristics of populations, measures employed and outcomes studied.
Results
Fig 1 shows the results of the search strategy and screening process. A total of 51 articles (from
46 independent studies) were included in the review. A summary of included articles by inter-
net medium and perceived influence can be seen in Table 1. Studies were based in the USA
(n = 10), UK (5 studies, 9 articles), Canada (n = 5), Japan (n = 3), Korea (n = 3), Australia
(n = 2), New Zealand (n = 2), Sweden (n = 2), China (n = 1), Germany (n = 1), Israel (n = 1),
Northern Ireland (n = 1), South Africa (n = 1), Taiwan(n = 1) and Turkey (n = 1), with the
remaining 7 studies (8 articles) from multiple countries. A total of 192,950 individuals partici-
pated. Forty-four of the 51 articles had more than 50% female participants. Eleven studies [15–
25] examined content of forum posts or websites in which participants were described only in
terms of demographics of site users. One study [26] examined rates of suicide by age group
with no further description of the number of participants. Using the CASP quality score 17
articles were assessed as high quality, 19 as medium quality and 15 as low (S3 Table). The qual-
ity of articles varied by study design with a greater proportion of quantitative (13/21) than

potential to recruit participants for research [15] and the nature of online information seeking
[27] (S4 Table). Measures ranged from study-specific self-report questionnaires or content
analysis themes to validated scales to assess suicidal behaviours, internet use, mental disorders
and well-being e.g. Internet Addiction Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Strength and Diffi-
culties Questionnaire, Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire.

 positive influences [27, 28]. One of high quality utilised digital to metrics to demonstrate high
levels of engagement reported in online discussions about mental health by young people [27].
The second, a low quality study, utilised a community survey and showed lower levels of
depression associated with frequent video game use. No association was found between media
use and suicidal ideation [28].
Seven studies identified negative influences [3, 26, 29–33]. Studies rated as high quality uti-
lised survey data and showed that high internet users and non-internet users were at higher
risk of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide when compared with moderate internet users
[31]. An ‘invisible risk’ group of individuals, who spent a lot of time online but did not engage
in other risky behaviours (e.g. smoking) and had similar prevalence of suicidal thoughts as the
‘visible’ risk group, was identified in another high quality school based survey [29]. A relation-
ship between internet use and self-harm was reported in several high quality papers. 15% of
girls and 26% of boys reported that either the internet or social media had influenced their
self-harm [33]. Risky online behaviours such as having a close relationship with someone met
online (38% of those who reported self-harm compared with 10% of those who did not) was
reported in a set of telephone interviews [32]. This relationship was further supported by an
additional low quality school-based survey where suicidal ideation was found to be signifi-
cantly associated with accessing suicide or self-injury information online (OR 5�11; 95% CI
0�35–0�75), anxiety about getting email replies (OR 2�06; 95% CI 1�33–3�20) and hurtful expe-
riences online (OR 1�71; 95% CI 1�03–2�84) [30]. In addition to the relationship between
online behaviours and self-harm it was found that the internet and social media had facilitated
the spread of information in a potential suicide cluster, and may have linked suicides otherwise
unconnected by school or district [3]. Furthermore, a relationship between internet searches
for specific suicide methods and the suicide rate in young people was found in one low quality
study [26].
Three studies showed mixed influences [20, 34, 35]. In one small but high quality set of
structured interviews participants found some interactive media supportive, while use of vio-
lent methods of self-harm were often preceded by viewing suicide related content online [34].
In a medium quality study aiming to examine self-harm content across internet mediums,
large dedicated self-harm social media groups, 2290 videos related to self-harm on YouTube
and high levels of views of videos about self-harm (the top video being viewed 339646 times)
were identified. Peer-driven websites were found to contain warnings of triggering content,
including stories and image galleries (not always present). These sites were accessed more fre-
quently than professionally-driven websites [20]. Participants partaking in structured inter-
views reported that online sources of information related to suicide were quite common, and
while social networking sites were frequently cited as sources these were not linked to increases
in suicidal ideation, whereas online discussion forums were [35].
Internet addiction
Seven studies [36–42] examined the relationship between internet addiction and self-harm.
For the purpose of this review internet addiction was distinguished from general internet use
if papers specifically referred to internet addiction or pathological internet use. There is no
agreed definition of internet addiction in the current literature. It ranges from an impulse con-
trol disorder likened to pathological gambling [36–38, 41] to assessments of level of functional
impairment or level of use [39, 40, 42]. All seven studies were rated as of high or medium/high
quality, utilised school-based surveys with validated outcome measures and all found a signifi-
cant relationship between internet addiction and self-harm/ suicidal behaviour. However, the
direction of causality remained unclear. Five of these studies found exclusively negative results

 [36–40]. When a pathway model was employed problematic internet use was found to predict
suicidal ideation alongside suicidal ideation predicting problematic internet use [40]. Two
studies showed mixed effects [41, 42]. Potential mechanisms of positive influences included
low levels of loneliness and higher levels of life satisfaction in individuals with possible internet
addiction and a potential protective influence of low levels of internet use compared with none
[42] (Table 3).
Online intervention/treatment
Six studies were of help administered online with the aim of reducing self-harm/suicidal
behaviour, often alongside other manifestations of psychological distress such as depression
and anxiety [43–48]. Participants came from a range of settings including schools [43], health-
care settings [44, 46] and universities [47, 48]. Positive influences were identified in four small
studies. The successful administration of a program of treatment for depression was demon-
strated in one high quality study [46]. Medium quality studies showed the successful imple-
mentation of an online monitoring tool for depression and suicidality [44], and for cognitive
behaviour therapy [43]. All three of these articles showed a reduction in either self-harm or
suicidal ideation. The fourth low/medium quality paper demonstrated that participants posi-
tively viewed the idea of mental health services delivered online via questionnaire data and
structured interviews [45]. Two much larger studies rated as high [48] and medium quality
[47] showed mixed influences, and in the first of these participants did not report negative
experiences following the completion of online surveys related to self-harm Participants
responding to distressed emails solved problems personally rather than suggesting professional
help, with females being more likely to offer help than males [47].
Social media
Four studies examined the role of social media, including one content analysis paper [21, 24,
49, 50]. For this review social media studies were defined as studies focused on social network-
ing sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Three studies showed negative influences, the studies
being rated as low [21, 49] or low/medium quality[24]. It was found that young people attend-
ing emergency departments are increasingly using social media to communicate distress prior
to hospital attendance for self-harm, particularly to a peer rather than to an adult [49]. Content
analysis of open self-harm groups on Facebook revealed glorification and normalisation of
self-harm [21]. While Facebook is a moderated site, groups are not moderated in the same way
as support forums, where there are often rules on appropriate content. Analysis of comments
on MySpace revealed suicidal thoughts, behaviours and intentions indicating significant
amounts of hopelessness and despair [24].
One article rated medium/high quality reported the results of an internet survey (n = 1000)
and contained mixed results [50]. Tweeting ‘want to die’ or ‘want to commit suicide’ was sig-
nificantly related to suicidal ideation and behaviour. However, no association was found with
simply having a twitter account or tweeting frequently [50].
Forums
Fourteen articles [15–19, 51–59] related to forums (five content analysis articles). For this
review forum use was defined as the use of dedicated support forums, separate from social
media sites. The setting of five of these was the ‘Sharptalk’ forum purposely built for research
[53–57]. Each article examined a different aspect of forum use, was of low or medium quality
and reported a positive influence. There was some reluctance on the part of health profession-
als in this study to participate actively in forums due to a reported lack of confidence and

 concerns relating to workload and duty of care [54]. In total, nine papers (five independent
studies) reported positive results; one high quality content analysis [16] and four medium and
low quality small studies [15, 51–57]. Five studies reported both positive and negative results;
one high quality [58] and four medium and low quality [17–19, 59]. All the studies recruited
via dedicated discussion forums. One study gathered data via in-depth email interviews [51],
all but one of the other papers analysed the content of posts and four studies additionally col-
lected data via questionnaires [53–59]
Positive influences identified in high quality papers include the potential for isolation reduc-
tion and informal support [16], and a significant reduction in suicidal thoughts following forum
use, although it was noted that a causal relationship could not be directly inferred [58]. Well-
moderated self-harm forums appeared to be viewed positively by young people as an online
community providing continued support. One study (n = 20) found that levels of forum involve-
ment were associated with lower levels of distress, but this level of distress did not decrease over
the three month study period [52]. The potential for support and isolation reduction was sup-
ported by a number of small medium and low quality papers [15, 16, 18, 19, 51–57, 59].
Negative influences include the use of forums for destructive means, such as finding a sui-
cide partner and exchange of potentially harmful information found in one high quality paper
[58] and four low and medium quality papers [17–19, 59]. Direct encouragement to go ahead
with suicide plans, including detailed suggestions of method, and validation for reasons given
for a planned suicide were also reported [19]. While some if the discourse was judged to be
potentially harmful, no association was found between worsened suicidal thoughts and forum
use [59].
Website with suicide/self-harm content
Two articles reported on websites with dedicated self-harm/suicide content. A medium quality
content analysis study of websites indicated negative influences, including that dedicated self-
harm websites may normalise and reinforce self-harm [25]. A large high quality cross-cultural
survey reported that individuals use these websites to gain help and support. While some par-
ticipants reported a reduction in self-harm a small number reported increased self-harm asso-
ciated with these websites.
Video/image sharing
Four articles focussed on video/image sharing [10, 22, 23, 61]. One medium/high quality con-
tent analysis of comments on self-harm videos identified negative influences [22]. Comments
on such videos illustrate a strong motivation for sharing experiences online, rarely mention
recovery and may contribute to the maintenance of self-harm. The other three papers were of
medium and low quality and identified mixed results [10, 23, 61]. Videos with self-harm con-
tent on YouTube were found to frequently contain explicit imagery with factual and educa-
tional tones [10]. Videos raising awareness of lesbian gay bisexual or trans (LGBT) suicides
highlighted that difficulties in life can be overcome; however, negative connotations were also
present [23]. Some participants recruited from an online self-harm community reported that
viewing of self-harm acted as a deterrent or alternative to self-harm, whilst others reported a
triggering effect and sense of competition [61].
Blogs
Two articles reported the content analysis of the same set of pro-anorexia blogs [62, 63]. Both
were rated as low quality and reported negative influences in the form of sharing potentially
harmful information related to self-harm and suicide methods and means of concealment.

 Across different mediums several studies focused on groups often hidden from traditional
research and service provision. For example, three studies focused on populations of LGBT
young people [15, 18, 23]. The first was an analysis of the content of YouTube videos raising
awareness of the level of suicide in LGBT youth [23]. The other two papers showed that online
discussion forums had the potential to engage this hard to reach group and to produce novel,
unmediated data [15]. This approach was utilised to gather data on LGBT young people’s per-
spective on seeking help for suicidal feelings. LGBT individuals found it challenging to articu-
late emotional distress and seek help from family members or professionals. They were most
comfortable communicating online, particularly in dedicated LGBT forums [18]. A further
two papers focused on young people with eating disorders [62, 63]. In these two studies a set of
eating-disorder blogs were analysed, which showed that discussion of self-harm and suicidal
thoughts was common.
Discussion
This systematic review is an update of a previous smaller review exploring the relationship
between internet use and self-harm [5] and incorporates previous evidence, thus also updating
the field. A total of 51 articles (representing 46 independent studies) were included, with 192950
individual participants, together with some reports of content analytical studies. While a com-
parable number of articles included positive (15), negative (19) and mixed (17) influences of the
internet on self-harm behaviour, articles demonstrating negative influences included more par-
ticipants (n = 119524) than those with positive (n = 38191) and mixed influences (n = 35235).
On balance, considering the quality of studies and numbers of participants assessed, there is sig-
nificant potential for harm of online behaviour in relation to self-harm and suicidal behaviour,
but also potential benefits that merit exploitation.
Results of this review are largely supportive of the findings of the previous review with com-
parable proportions of studies with positive and negative results [5]. However, in recent years
this field of research has developed substantially allowing greater examination of details such
as medium of internet use and for a greater range of positive and negative influences to be
identified. Studies on general internet use, internet addiction and online interventions/treat-
ment presented the strongest evidence, with mostly high or medium quality research. High
internet use and internet addiction appear to have largely negative influences. Twelve studies
examined general internet use, half of which were of high quality. The latter group of studies
demonstrated that high levels of internet use (more than two [31] or five [29] hours per day)
were associated with suicidal ideation [29, 31]. Further low and medium quality research sug-
gested that self-harm and suicidal ideation were related to searching online for suicide infor-
mation [30] and that searches for specific methods were related to rates of suicide in young
people [26]. Online media appeared to facilitate the spread of information, linking otherwise
unconnected suicides, making it difficult to recognize and manage a suicide cluster [3].
Research examining internet addiction represented the most homogenous group of studies; all
employed high/medium quality quantitative methodologies in the form of cross sectional
school-based surveys and validated outcome measures. All studies examining internet addic-
tion found a relationship between internet addiction and self-harm or suicidal behaviour. The
direction of causality of the negative influence of internet addiction and self-harm/suicidal
behaviour was unclear. Positive influences included lower levels of loneliness [41] and a poten-
tial protective influence of low levels of internet use when compared with no internet use at all
[31, 42]. Other studies have found that low and high internet use is associated with higher ado-
lescent health risks than moderate use [31]. The internet may provide an opportunity to be
part of a community online when this is lacking in everyday life. The potential of the internet

 as a medium to deliver interventions to address suicidal behaviours and self-harm was exam-
ined in six studies of medium to high quality, with mixed results but generally being viewed
positively by participants.
Studies exploring the other mediums (social media, forums, videos/ images sharing, blogs)
were smaller, of lower quality and with more mixed results. Only one paper related to social
media was rated as medium/high quality. Distressed online posts were found to be related to
suicidal ideation and behaviour, but there was no evidence suggesting that simply using social
media presents a risk [50]. The remaining low and medium/low quality research found that
young people are increasingly using social media to communicate distress, particularly to
peers [49]. This is in keeping with more recent research showing that self-harm and suicide-
related internet use prior to ED attendance is higher among children and young people than
in adults, and is additionally related to higher suicidal intent [64]. While social media is being
utilised here to communicate distress, this does not indicate a causal relationship. Glorification
and normalisation of self-harm was found in two of the four social media studies [21, 24].
Forums were viewed positively as a source of peer support. There was evidence of a reduction
in suicidal thoughts following forum use in one high quality study [58] but also evidence of
normalisation of self-harm, encouragement to go ahead with suicide plans and discussion of
how to conceal self-harm, supported by one high quality and a number of medium and low
quality studies [16, 17, 19, 50, 58]. The impact of forum use on levels of self-harm remains
unclear. Videos were highly viewed/shared, largely factual or educational and often contained
graphic imagery, but rarely with warnings of such content [10]. One high quality study found
that comments on videos may contribute towards the maintenance of self-harm and suggests a
strong motivation for sharing experiences online. It remains unclear whether this sharing of
experiences has a positive or negative impact on individuals, with its influence likely to vary
with individual circumstances [22]. In the remaining (low quality) study some participants
reported an alleviating effect of images, others a triggering one [61]. Sharing of potentially
harmful information related to self-harm and suicide was reported in two small low quality
studies of the same set of pro-anorexia blogs [62, 63].
The variation in results between mediums may be partially attributable to study design and
participant samples. Research examining general internet use and internet addiction was
largely based on school surveys employing validated outcome measures and found largely neg-
ative influences of internet use. In contrast, research examining forum use recruited almost
exclusively from online discussion forums, undertook content analysis of forum posts, some-
times alongside questionnaire data, and often found positive influences. The contrasting
results between studies recruiting from general population and self-selecting participants are
not unexpected. Studies with more diverse participant samples and employing validated out-
come measures may assist in clarification of the effects of different types of medium.
Research in this area may be biased towards measuring certain effects and outcomes e.g. a
positive effect for interventions, or a negative effect for internet addiction. The choice of out-
come measures may reflect the expected effects of the internet and fail to capture the full com-
plexity of the experience of individuals. This is a risk in all research but may be a particular issue
in this field. For example, studies examining internet addiction report largely negative results.
However one study found that internet addicted individuals reported high levels of life satisfac-
tion and low levels of loneliness that may not have been identified had these measures not been
included [41]. In future investigations researchers should aim to ensure that outcome measures
capture both possible positive and negative outcomes in order to give a complete and unbiased
picture. Such steps can be seen in more recent research. For example an online treatment for
depression resulted in symptom reduction but examination of possible negative influences
demonstrated that individuals with lower education were at higher risk of symptoms becoming

 more severe [65]. Another recent study found both positive and negative influences of websites
detailing suicide methods [66].
In keeping with the previous review [5] the majority of studies finding solely negative influ-
ences utilised quantitative methodologies. Mixed methods and qualitative studies tended to
report more mixed results. It is unclear if this is a discrepancy between what participants
report and actual outcomes or if quantitative data are failing to capture the complexity of the
issue. This is further compounded by the mostly low quality of included qualitative studies.
High quality qualitative and quantitative research is needed to establish whether differences in
the influence of various mediums are partially attributable to study design.
Strengths and limitations
The potential for publication bias exists in any review of literature and should be considered
when interpreting the results. Steps were taken to minimise any bias as much as possible
including conducting an extensive search of multiple databases including grey literature data-
bases and topic specific websites, reviewing reference lists and contacting experts in the field.
However, only English language publications were included. It was noticeable that males
remain under-represented in studies. Further examination of any gender differences is a
potential avenue for future research.
While the decision to review literature related to cyber-bullying in a separate review
will have had an influence on the proportion of articles reporting positive and negative
results, it will allow for a more in-depth discussion of this important topic. The inclusion
of this large body of research would have created an unwieldy review or necessitated a
more cursory discussion of internet mediums. Literature related to cyber-bullying is
unlikely to report any positive outcomes and had it been included it would have added to
studies reporting a negative influence. This could potentially be viewed as an important
bias in this review. However, results of this review highlight that the internet has the poten-
tial for both positive and negative influences dependent on the way in which it is used.
Identifying both beneficial and harmful mediums and directing individuals towards
healthy online behaviour should be considered of greater importance than weighing up
whether the internet is simply ‘good’ or ‘bad’.
While this review summarises data from an extensive search, there will be further literature
published since the search was conducted. Based on the number of additional articles in the
two years since the review by Daine et al [5] it is likely that this will represent a considerable
body of research. Summarising it is likely to be beyond the scope of one review. Because of the
rapidly increasing body of research, authors conducting future systematic reviews on this topic
may consider reviewing by specific internet medium (forums, videos etc.) to ensure the task is
manageable and the resultant reviews are of sufficient depth in each area to allow identification
of key messages for clinicians and policy makers. While a range of internet mediums were
included in this review, recent research has expanded even further, for example examining
behaviours such as online gambling [67].
The quality of qualitative studies in this review appeared mostly to be low. While this may
be reflective of quality, the appropriateness of using checklists to assess qualitative research has
been questioned due to the diversity of approaches in collecting, analysing and interpreting
data [68, 69]. This may be particularly problematic with research into internet use where there
is considerable heterogeneity in methodology across study designs. It is unlikely that a single
checklist would be suitable to capture all aspects of study quality across the range of study
designs, populations and outcomes. Authors of future reviews in this area might consider the
selection of quality outcome measures that fully capture the quality of various study designs.

 It is not always possible in studies examining forum use or comments on videos/photos to
accurately determine the characteristics of individuals and young people may misrepresent
their age when creating profiles. Therefore ages of participants were not always clearly
reported but were inferred by study authors based on demographics of typical users of sites or
based on profile information.
It was a challenge to categorise findings as negative or positive in some studies [5]. The
sharing of experiences online, for example, while therapeutic for some, may be destructive for
others. The expression of distress online could be viewed as negative on the one hand, but as
an opportunity for intervention on the other. This is an area of research where outcomes are
not always clear cut. It was not always easy to understand whether certain factors acted as
mediators or moderators of distress, nor the long-term implications. For example, individuals
with a history of self-harm were more likely to report discomfort following online question-
naire completion related to self-harm, but it also caused them to think more deeply about their
lives which may have been positive [48]. While it has been possible here to broadly discuss the
influence of various mediums and to identify those that may represent a higher risk, the impact
of various aspects of internet use is likely to vary between individuals and over time and should
therefore always be assessed on an individual basis.
A wider range of internet mediums was examined than was possible previously [5]. This
has resulted in a varied pool of participants, including those recruited from discussion forums,
schools and healthcare settings. The majority of quantitative studies employed validated out-
come measures, in contrast to literature identified in the previous review [5], allowing some
comparison of results across studies. However, the considerable range in methodology, popu-
lation and outcomes studied means that, at this time, it is not possible to conduct a meaningful
statistical meta-analysis.
Implications
The volume of self-harm videos shared on YouTube and the high number of views and com-
ments have led to suggestions of developing videos to emphasise help and recovery [10, 22].
The introduction of psycho-educational prevention programmes in schools concerning appro-
priate responses to distressed posts on social media and digital citizenship may mitigate some
of the negative influences of the internet [20, 47, 49]. The internet is a potential tool for out-
reach by health professionals. Research suggests some disconnect between healthcare profes-
sionals and media usage [11]. This was only explicitly discussed in one set of studies reviewed
here in which health professionals expressed discomfort about engaging with young people in
an online setting and had concerns over duty of care [54]. This could be addressed through
further training and encouragement of clinicians working with young people who self-harm
or have mental health issues to engage in discussion about internet use. This should be a stan-
dard item during assessment. It could include the asking about the role of images/videos [61]
and designing treatment plans to maximise beneficial online behaviours and reduce associated
harms [20].
Suggestions have been made for the implementation of guidance to individuals and service
providers such as avoiding details of method and including warnings of graphic content on web
pages [20]. Stricter regulations could be modelled on the initiative in Australia, where pro-sui-
cide sites were banned in 2006 [70]. Several major social media platforms (Tumblr, Pintrest,
Instagram, Facebook) have responded to concerns and implemented policies regarding posts
related to self-harm. Such content may not be searchable, is banned or brings up links to coun-
selling and prevention resources [71]. The potential to access groups online largely hidden from
the health service, such as those for LGBT individuals or those with eating disorders for both

 interventions and research may improve access to care and allow representation in research
that has not been possible previously. Any online sign-posting or interventions should not be
limited to platforms exclusively dedicated to self-harm but should also extend to other groups at
potential risk. This is supported by recent research finding that experiences of victimisation are
associated with entering pro self-harm and pro-suicide websites [72].
Conclusions
Research concerning the internet and self-harm in young people is rapidly evolving in an
attempt to keep pace with the continually changing nature of its use. On balance, considering
the quality of studies and numbers of participants assessed in this review, there is significant
potential for harm to result from online behaviour in relation to self-harm and suicidal behav-
iour (normalisation, triggering and competition between users, a source of contagion and
harmful information for vulnerable individuals), but also the potential to exploit its benefits (a
sense of community, crisis support and reduction of social isolation). The focus should now be
on a range of internet mediums including social media, video/image sharing, and the potential
for the internet to be used in therapy and recovery.
There were a number of innovative suggestions from research teams responsible for publi-
cations, including educational programmes in schools to teach young people how to respond
to distressed posts/messages on social media and repeated calls for clinicians to be aware of
internet use. The internet may also represent an under-utilised setting to access ‘hidden’ at risk
groups, giving them a voice both in research and in practice.
