 Introduction
There is increasing concern about mosquito-borne disease, ampli-
fied by the recent Latin American outbreaks of Zika virus, which 
have raised new alarm about their rapid spread and illness in vul-
nerable populations1. The fact that globalization increases vector 
migration has been demonstrated with the first finding of mosqui-
toes infected with the African West Nile virus in 2009 in the New 
York City region2. The Americas have seen invasion of dengue 
virus, chikungunya virus, and most recently the Zika virus, causing 
dangerous outbreaks and subsequent morbidity and mortality that 
have proved difficult to control in a sustainable manner.
All of these viruses, plus the yellow fever virus, are transmitted 
mainly by mosquitoes of the Aedes genus (subgender: Stegomyia), 
more specifically the African species Aedes aegypti, one of the 
most aggressive vector mosquitoes capable of transmitting these 
illnesses, and to a lesser level the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes 
albopictus, which prefers to bite during the day and is emerging as 
one of the most adaptable insects in the world3–5. The rapid rise of 
virus transmission on the American continent is due partly to the 
lack of historical immunological experience (have not been exposed 
to the viral infection) or known cross-immunization to the different 
species and viral genotypes6,7 of the people in the Americas. A 
second factor affecting the transmission is the stationary abundance 
of the vector Ae aegypti and other species susceptible to viral infec-
tion (e.g. Culex spp?). Furthermore, the traditional control method – 
pesticide – is both indiscriminate and thwarted by the multiple cases 
of pesticide resistance in Aedes mosquitoes recently reported8,9.
The rapid spread of Ae aegypti mosquitoes in most of the American 
continent began around 200010, and now dengue fever is active in 
more than 128 countries11, chikungunya virus in 40 countries12, and 
the Zika virus in currently 26 countries and rising13.
So while the globalization of Aedes spp. mosquitoes started more 
than 15 years ago, we have not been able to stop or control it. What 
solutions are available?
Several methods have been employed for detecting the presence 
of mosquitoes in the field, but none have proved perfect. Standard 
ovitraps to monitor Aedes mosquitoes are large 1-litre black buck-
ets (Figure 1) filled with plain water or attractant solutions based 
on natural plant infusions, along with a wooden strip or porous 
pellon paper, which the mosquito lands on and lays its eggs (called 
oviposition)14,15.
Human landing techniques have also been used, but less so now 
due to ethical concerns. The BG-Sentinel trap is a newer mosquito 
monitoring device, which has proved similar or better to the human-
landing method for the detection of mosquitoes such as Anopheles 
darling16.
Of these monitoring methods, only the standard ovitraps have 
thus far proved to effectively reduce the amount of adult mosqui-
toes when they are used for extended periods and the ovitraps are 
continually surveyed and maintained, a very expensive and time- 
consuming exercise17.
To overcome these limitations, other ovitraps have appeared on 
the market – some force the larvae to a confined, flooded partition 
where they die because they cannot reach the surface and breathe. 
Others contain glue or larvicidal compounds, chemical or biologi-
cal (e.g. Bacillus thuringensis, fish ‘Poecillia maylandi’), to rapidly 
destroy the larvae. Each of these new traps has monitoring merits, 
but none have proved efficacious in the control and reduction of 
mosquitoes in field studies18.
Typically, the water or attractant solution used in these ovitraps is 
removed and expelled into the ground each time the ovitrap is sur-
veyed, and as a result any larvae or pupae are destroyed on the dry 
soil. The collection of the eggs “glued” to the landing strip allows 
for counting and thus monitoring. Two problems have been identi-
fied with this “dumping” of the solution. First, the need for clean 
replacement water is often problematic in remote areas without 
the basic infrastructure, and second, any eggs dislodged from the

 landing strip onto the dumped water or solution represent the pos-
sibility of continuous reproduction of mosquitoes. It is known that 
Aedes eggs can survive on the dry ground for several months19, thus 
creating a compromised situation of perpetual reproduction.
To address these problems, we determined that filtration and recy-
cling of the solution (either water or attractant) seemed to be an 
optimal alternative, and we set about developing a modified ovitrap. 
The most attracting solution to Aedes mosquitoes is the solution that 
has had larvae of the same species (conspecific larvae), making the 
recycling of the solution more attractive to female mosquitoes20.
The development of our modified ovitrap at Laurentian University 
in Sudbury, Canada was initially geared to the reduction of the local 
West Nile virus vector, mainly the species Culex pipiens and Culex 
restuans. A 90% selective reduction of the adult mosquitoes of these 
species was achieved over three months around the site where the 
ovitraps were installed in 2008 (unpublished report, Ulibarri et al.). 
The attractant solution used in these modified ovitraps was based 
on the fermentation of natural plants spiked with homemade chemi-
cals known to be oviposition-attractive to these species, which we 
also developed. The modified ovitrap is commercially available from 
Green-Strike, Canada (http://green-strike.com/products/mosquito-
preventer-2) together with the solutions that selectively attract the 
local Culex spp. (Cu-Lure™) or Aedes spp. mosquitoes (Ae-Lure™) 
(e.g Aedes vexans/Ochlerotatus canadiensis). The attractant has the 
advantage of being both non-toxic and environmentally sensitive.
The same principles driving the Canadian ovitrap were later used 
in a field study during 2013-2014 in Petatlán, Mexico against the 
dengue fever mosquitoes Ae albopictus and Ae aegypti. The Aedes 
oviposition was reduced by 71% on the site with the modified ovit-
raps, compared to oviposition in a control site (unpublished report, 
Ulibarri et al.).
Building on these previous studies, we undertook a field study 
in Sayaxche, Guatemala beginning in February 2015. We were 
determined to use an integrated approach that involved education 
of the community and health workers responsible for vector control 
about the mosquito cycle, sustainable strategies for keeping homes 
and gardens clean and unattractive to mosquitoes, the implementa-
tion and maintenance of mosquito traps, and collaboration between 
community and health sectors to collectively manage vector control 
and prevention of mosquito borne disease. Here we describe our 
project and its results.
When we embarked on the collaborative project, two challenges 
arose immediately. First, we discovered that local health workers 
required more extensive training in vector control than initially 
thought. This was promptly solved when the Instituto Nacional de 
Salud Publica (INSP) in Cuernavaca, Mexico offered to share a beta 
version of a web-based programme they created with the Interna-
tional Development Research Centre (IDRC) in Canada, to provide 
vector control and health information in Spanish (see Annex 1).
Second, we were unable to procure our original ovitraps from 
Canada, and we needed to search for an appropriate alternative. We 
decided to use recycled tires – partly because tires represent up to 
29% of the breeding sites chosen by Ae aegypti mosquitoes, and 
it also gave us the opportunity to recycle some old tires that were 
littering the local environment21,22. Modifying the ovitrap with tires 
gave birth to the ovillanta, a piece of a tire fitted with a valve to help 
direct the attractant solution to a filter (Figure 1).
Methods
For this project, we designed the intervention to include three com-
ponents in an integrated fashion: training health workers in vector 
control, low-cost ecological mosquito ovillanta, and community 
engagement. We sought to determine the effectiveness of this inte-
grated intervention on Aedes spp. mosquito control over 10 months 
in 2015 in an urban remote community in Guatemala at risk of 
dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus transmission.
Our project was enabled by intersectoral collaboration between 
academic researchers, local health authorities from the Ministry 
of Health Vector Control Programme of Guatemala. international 
collaborators in Canada, Guatemala and Mexico, and community 
members. Our broad goal was to empower the community, sup-
ported by trained health personnel, to adopt the administration, care 
and maintenance of the health of the community.
Ethics. This study was reviewed and authorized by the representa-
tives of the Program on Vector-Borne Transmitted Diseases of the 
Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance of Guatemala (Pro-
grama de Enfermedades Trasmitidas por Vectores del Ministerio de 
Salud Publica y Asistencia Social (ETV/MSPAS) de Guatemala). 
The MSPSA follows guidelines adopted from the Reglamento 
del Sub-Comité de ética e investigación (www.paho.com)23. We 
interviewed and invited each of the health workers to participate 
in the web-based training and encouraged them to voluntarily sub-
scribe online to the program. We personally engaged people within 
the community, always accompanied by workers from the Health 
Unit of Sayaxche. It is customary in the region to first engage the 
representatives of the community by a verbal invitation to sit down 
and discuss the project. Once permission was obtained, we rand-
omized the houses, and invited adults to voluntarily participate, 
assuring them that if there was anything that caused discomfort we 
would withdraw them immediately from the program. All invita-
tions, focus groups, and interviews were verbally carried out in 
Spanish and recorded on a portable recorder, and transcribed soon 
after. When necessary, an interpreter was present for interviews with 
non-Spanish speaking community members. We, accompanied by 
representatives of the community leaders, explained the benefits 
of their participation and their responsibilities, allowing them to 
voluntarily join the study project. The protocol for the community 
engagement/social participation evaluations was also presented and 
approved by the ETV/MSPAS representatives.
Study area. Sayaxche is a remote urban center of the 
southwestern part and health unit area of the Peten territory in 
Guatemala. It borders the states of Chiapas and Tabasco in 
Mexico. Sayaxche’s Q’eqchi Maya origin means the ‘Ceiba’s wye 
or fork.’ The surface is 3752 km2 and occupies 10.9% of Peten’s 
territory. It is 250 m above sea level, with a warm, varied and humid 
tropical climate, with a rainy season (June to November) and a dry 
season (December to May). The monthly average temperature

 varies between 23°C (December/January) and 32°C (in the dry 
month of May).
Intervention. Our three-component integrated intervention con-
sisted of: a) web-based training of local health personnel in vector 
control, b) cluster-randomised assignment of ecological ovillantas 
or standard ovitraps to capture Ae aegypti mosquitoes, and c) com-
munity engagement to promote participation of community mem-
bers and health personnel in the understanding and maintenance of 
ovitraps for mosquito control.
a) Web-based training of local health personnel in vector con-
trol (Annex 2). As we embarked on our project we consulted with 
the local health authorities, including the manager of the Vector 
Control Programme in Sayaxche, to determine the needs of the per-
sonnel. These included the need for improved technical skills, liais-
ing with community including cultural sensitivity, and promoting 
and implementing programmes, as well as a strong need to improve 
the efficacy of the preventive measures of vector transmission in the 
region. As mentioned earlier, the health workers had higher educa-
tional needs than we had initially expected.
To meet these needs, we collaborated with academic leaders 
at the INSP and with colleagues in the EcoHealth Leadership 
Initiative on Vector Borne Diseases for Latin America and the 
Caribbean, which is part of IDRC. We developed learning objec-
tives, a web-based platform and a bibliography of resources to 
help strengthen the technical skills of the health personnel in the 
vigilance, prevention and control of vector-borne diseases using an 
ecosystem approach that aims for sustainability and is tailored to 
local community needs (see Annex 1 and Annex 2 for more details 
of the curricular planning). The web-based training modelled a 
dynamic process of teaching-learning, incorporating both theoreti-
cal and practical aspects of how to prevent and control vector-borne 
diseases. It utilized diverse learning strategies with specific content 
sessions, directed homework, and literature review. It took place 
over 5 months (April to September) in 2015, covering 40 hours in 
total, with 50% of practice and homework on a virtual platform.
We measured improved knowledge and skills of local health per-
sonnel in vector control by their successful accreditation following 
the web-based training programme.
b) Control of vector mosquitoes using ovillantas. We developed 
an ecological ovillanta from recycled tires, and compared this 
device to standard ovitraps in terms of mosquito oviposition. We 
quantified egg collection from standard ovitraps on sites with 
ovillantas and compared it to standard ovitraps on sites without 
ovillantas.
We modified the standard ovitrap to create ovillantas, made out 
of a piece of recycled tire with a PVC flanged wash basin drain-
type tube and a valve, for the capture of the vector mosquito’s eggs 
(Ae aegypti). The attractant solution called Ae-Lure (8 mL; Green-
Strike, Canada) was placed on the ovillanta and two litres of clean 
well water were added. Each ovillanta contained two landing 
strips – one on each end of the apparatus. For the landing strips we 
used 15×10 cm pieces of pellon paper, but other porous material 
might be used.
We compared the ecological ovillantas with the standard ovit-
rap, which was a black bucket containing one litre of clean well 
water with one piece of the same pellon paper (but of a larger size, 
30×10 cm) around the rim.
The urban core of Sayaxche contains 15 neighbourhoods, which 
comprised 14,454 inhabitants within 3,882 houses. We designed the 
random sampling based on our previous study in Petatlán, Mexico 
(unpublished report, Ulibarri et al.) and modified it to fit Sayaxche, 
applied as follows: 14 neighbourhoods (out of 15) were divided in 
half making two separate groups, the study group and the control 
group. Within each neighbourhood, 3 continuous blocks of houses 
were randomly chosen and one house at the center of each side of 
the block (north, east, south and west) was consulted to set up either 
2 ovillantas and 1 standard ovitrap (study site) or 1 standard ovitrap 
per house (control site). If a chosen house declined to participate, 
the next house was invited. In the end each neighbourhood had 
12 households participating. The total number of sites with 
ovillantas/ovitraps were 84 for the study group and 84 for the con-
trol group (see Table 1 for the names of the neighbourhoods).
Once the ovillantas and ovitraps were installed in the different 
households, the health workers started cleaning the ovillantas in the 
presence of household members and, later on, as interest increased, 
household members themselves were responsible for cleaning the 
ovillantas or ovitraps, in the presence of health workers. At the 
beginning of our project, the joint care and egg collection was car-
ried out once a week, on a day pre-established with the community. 
During the high season (June-October), it was necessary to monitor 
and clean the ovillantas and ovitraps twice a week, in order to avoid 
the production of mosquitoes due to the rapid development of the 
larvae during high temperatures. The pellon papers containing the 
eggs were removed and given to the health workers, and new clean 
pieces of paper were installed. The papers with the eggs were taken 
to the laboratory of the local health unit by the health workers, and 
counted there by specialized personnel.
At the beginning of the project we started with three different 
types of mosquito traps: an ecological ovillanta with AE-Lure, an 
ecological ovillanta with Malaria-Lure, and the standard ovitrap 
with water. But shortly after initiation, we discovered Malaria-Lure 
to be ineffective for malaria-parasite carrying Anopheles mosqui-
toes. Therefore, by week 4 we changed all ecological ovillantas to 
include AE-Lure only.
We measured mosquito control by the mean number of eggs counted 
in ecological ovillantas versus standard ovitraps during 31 collec-
tions over 10 months between Feb and Nov 2015. Egg counting was 
undertaken once a week.
c) Community engagement. Through training, our intersecto-
ral multidisciplinary approach aimed to improve and sustain the 
technical competencies of health workers. Through the modifica-
tion of the ovitrap, we were sensitive to cost, ecological concerns, 
and local applicability. For both of these integrated interventions to 
work, community involvement was required. Therefore, we simul-
taneously undertook community engagement activities, recognising 
the importance of sustained social participation by both community 
members and health workers.

 We developed strategies to engage the main representatives of the 
community, in order to motivate participation in the mosquito con-
trol programme. We focused on education of the community (in 
addition to health workers) about the mosquito cycle, sustainable 
strategies for keeping homes and gardens clean and unattractive 
to mosquitoes, the implementation and maintenance of mosquito 
traps, and collaboration between community and health sectors to 
collectively manage vector control and prevention of mosquito-
borne disease. Specifically, community members were taught how 
to safely keep the ovillantas or ovitraps, including how to clean 
the traps, change the pellon paper and hand the pellon paper to 
the health workers. They were incentivised by the education they 
received on how to reduce the amount of mosquitoes and thus 
keep themselves and the community healthy. Another strong 
incentive was the absence of fogging, thus no pesticides in their 
 
neighbourhood, unless they did not care for the ovillantas properly 
and there were too many mosquitoes.
We measured social participation by surveying community member 
and health worker perceptions, knowledge and participation in 
mosquito control using qualitative methods. (see Annex 3 for fuller 
details of the evaluation of social participation). Focus groups were 
undertaken in eight neighbourhoods, four from the study site and 
four from the control site. Within each neighbourhood, one person 
from 24 randomly selected households (12 households with either 
ovillantas or ovitraps and 12 households that did not have either,

 but were located within the neighbourhoods of the study) was 
invited to participate in a focus group. Of the sixteen focus groups, 
the number of participants ranged from three to eight household 
members each.
In addition, qualitative interviews were conducted with three health 
workers who undertook the training and participated in the mos-
quito control programme, and one programme manager. Evaluation 
of social participation and analysis of the qualitative data was car-
ried out at the beginning (February 2015) during the setup of the 
ovillantas and ovitraps in each household, in order to establish a 
base level for evaluation. This was followed by a second interview 
at the end of the project (December 2015). The interviews were 
carried out following the protocol validated by the ETV/MSPAS 
representative and were conducted by an experienced researcher 
independent from the other two components of the project 
 
(ovillanta study, web-based training) (MB).
Data analysis. We analysed quantitative variables (egg count) and 
categorical variables (area, type of trap) for their frequency of dis-
tribution, measuring the central tendency with a graphical repre-
sentation and distribution tests. The software package Stata13® was 
used to carry out the t-tests, which analyze the difference between 
two means and the dispersion of the scores (see Dataset 1).
With respect to the qualitative data, we undertook an analysis per 
topic to understand perceptions, social participation, usefulness of 
strategies for control and prevention of the diseases, negative and 
positive factors of the control programme, and recommendations 
for future strategies.
Entomological poll. A survey of potential breeding sites was con-
ducted in each house of the intervention neighbourhoods, where 
the ovillantas were placed. Each container capable of accumulating 
water (drums, tires, cans, etc.) was analysed and larvae/pupae were 
counted if present. A percentage of each type of container that was 
positive was established compared to the total number of containers 
found (see Dataset 2).

a) Web-based training of health workers in vector control. 
Twenty five health workers subscribed to the web-based training 
programme (of 35 eligible). Most had obtained elementary school 
level education (67%); the remainder had achieved junior high 
school level (18%), high school (10%), or university undergraduate 
level (5%). Following the web-based training (comprised of online 
lectures, case studies, virtual discussions and homework) teams 
of students worked on a proposed ecological intervention for the 
prevention and control of the vector mosquito in Sayaxche using a 
manual validated by the academic unit of the INSP (Annex 1) and 
were evaluated (directly by the INSP evaluation personnel, inde-
pendently from the project’s participants). Eighty percent of the 
students were accredited, obtaining between 75 and 95 points out 
of 100, and receiving a certification issued by the INSP.
The perceptions and evaluations of the course by the students and 
program coordinators were remarkably positive, recommending 
that the course be implemented in all health units across Guatemala. 
Nevertheless, several difficulties were reported by the students. The 
most important was the difficulty to access computer equipment and 
the lack of training on the use of computers with internet in remote 
places. Some students complained about the excess of homework 
and the little time allocated for it. However, it was a general con-
sensus that the applied benefits generated by the learning process 
were immediately felt in the technical field work, making the health 
workers more reassured.
b) Ecological ovillanta. A total of 84 households (from 2204 in 
the area) were the focus of study within the 7 study site neighbour-
hoods. All 84 households that agreed to participate in our study 
were allocated to the study intervention (2 ecological ovillantas 
and 1 standard ovitrap). Intervention households were no more than 
50 metres apart (in three continuous blocks), which we felt gave 
sufficient coverage because mosquitoes tend to fly up to 500 m 
around looking for blood or an oviposition site24.
Ovillantas were set up on Feb 8, 2015; the monitoring ovitraps were 
installed only on April 12, 2015. All of the systems, ovillantas and 
control ovitraps, were monitored and cleaned by the health workers 
on a weekly basis, with community members present. The health 
workers filtered and recycled the attractant solution, counting and 
eliminating any eggs deposited on the landing strips. One interrup-
tion of this weekly schedule took place, for 5 weeks in August and 
September, due to labour and political problems within the Ministry 
of Health in Guatemala.
The mean weekly egg count was higher in neighbourhoods with 
ovillantas with a mean of 19.26334 (SE 0.4707; 95% CI: 18.34056, 
20.18613) than at the control sites using standard ovitraps, with a 
mean of 13.2787 (SE 0.8249; 95% CI: 11.66214, 14.89748). The 
difference was statistically significant (t= 5.2577; p< 0.05).
Figure 2-left, shows the total amount of Aedes eggs collected 
and destroyed per month at the study sites using ovillantas (blue) 
(181,336 eggs over 10 months) and ovitraps (orange) (27,053 
eggs).
Figure 2-right, shows the amount of Aedes eggs collected and 
destroyed at the study site, per ovillanta (blue) or ovitrap (orange). 
This shows that ovillantas are almost twice as effective in attracting 
Aedes oviposition than the standard ovitraps.

Figure 3. Weekly oviposition mean values in ovillantas and monitoring ovitraps.
Figure 3 shows the mean value between the ovillantas and standard 
ovitraps, during the 42 weeks of the study.
However, within the study site households, there were no statisti-
cally significant differences in the amount of Aedes eggs collected 
from ecological ovillantas and standard ovitraps over the 42 week 
study. We believe this may be because mosquitoes leave a natural 
pheromone with each egg each time they oviposit, thus the recy-
cling may have concentrated the natural pheromone (the initial 
solution was not discarded, but instead new solution was added). 
Understanding this further will be the focus of a future study.
We also observed that independent of the data obtained per 
neighbourhood, the amount of Aedes eggs collected was 
greater on standard ovitraps (mean= 20. 514, SE 0.6181; 95% 
CI: 19.30213, 21.7254) when compared to ovillantas at the same 
site (mean= 15.854, SE 0.55027; 95% CI: 14.77511, 16.93254), 
with a statistically significant difference of t= -5.581 (p< 0.05). 
Furthermore, we observed that standard ovitraps at the same sites 
as ovillantas (i.e., study sites) (mean= 23.985, SE 0.8103; 95% 
CI: 22.396, 25.574) collected more Aedes eggs than standard ovit-
raps at the control sites (no ovillantas present) (mean= 13.279, SE 
0.824; 95% CI: 11.622, 14.89). We speculate that there may be a 
synergistic attraction effect when there are ovillantas present in 
close proximity to standard ovitraps, which could explain why the 
cluster of ovillantas/ovitraps produced better results per unit than an 
ovitrap alone (Figure 2, right).
The observed amount of Aedes eggs differed within neighbour-
hood. There was also the competition of the ovillantas/ovitraps 
against natural breeding places within a given house, based upon 
an entomological poll we conducted (Table 2). Among the study

 neighbourhoods, El Centro stands out as the site with highest egg 
count across the study period (mean= 47.23; 95% CI: 43.12, 51.34), 
and major breeding container diversity, with 127 different types 
(drums: 16.26%, laundry water basin: 21.95%, tubs: 9.76% and 
other smaller containers: 21.95%, and from each one of the con-
tainer types: 40%, 37.04%, 16.97% and 22,22%, respectively pre-
sented a positive larval/pupae count). El Centro produced 23.58% 
of the total Aedes larvae found among all the study sites. In the 
neighbourhood La Esperanza (mean= 41.22) an average of 7.79% 
of the whole containers contained larvae/pupae. While the same 
were found among the laundry water basin and buckets/canisters 
in 12.50% of each type of container. In the neighbourhood of San 
Miguel 50% of the tires found contained larvae/pupae, followed by 
37.50% of laundry water basins. In contrast the neighbourhoods of 
La Pista and Hojita Verde showed the lowest levels of larvae pro-
duction among the inspected containers with 4.55% (mean= 4.05) 
and 4.44% (mean= 0.14), respectively. In both of these neighbour-
hoods the drums were the main containers where larvae were found 
(21.05% and 16.67%, respectively).
We were unable to conduct definitive viral identification tests 
because the technology does not exist, or is inaccessible in these 
remote locations. The low numbers among the official reports 
 
(Table 3) show the limitations, in several communities around 
Sayaxche, of establishing a surveillance of confirmed or suspected 
cases. Cases are diagnosed only in extreme clinical conditions of 
fever, rash, etc.
c) Social participation. Sixteen focus groups with household mem-
bers were conducted, across eight neighbourhoods – four within the 
study site and four within the control site. Each group comprised 
three to eight participants (70% women), out of 12 people per focus 
group invited.
Taken together, several themes of sociocultural issues were identi-
fied from the focus groups, which can help guide future strategies 
geared to strengthen community participation in mosquito control:
1.    
Belief that the mosquitoes breed only in natural ponds, not 
in backyards.
2.    
Belief that cleaning of the house and garden are tasks of 
women only.
3.    
Belief that the Ministry of Health’s services are not 
efficient.
4.    
Preference for self-medication using local medicinal 
plants (e.g. Cat’s Claw (Uncaria tomentosa) against 
dengue and chikungunya fever.
5.    
Very little information is provided to the public about the 
cause of illness and consequences.
6.   
Dependency of the community on public services to main-
tain the cleanliness of the streets.
7.    
Dependency of the community on public antimalarial con-
trol, without participation.
8.

 9.    
Communication difficulties between some ethnic groups.
10.   
Low acceptance of new mosquito control methods and 
transmission prevention strategies, despite wanting less 
reliance on pesticides.
In terms of the ecological ovillanta as a form of mosquito control, 
community members provided several views. Overall, the recy-
cling of the attractant solution was welcomed given the difficulty 
to obtain clean water in the region. There was satisfaction with the 
use of both the ovillantas and ovitraps as preventive methods and to 
reduce the overall number of adult mosquitoes. There was interest 
in knowing how many Aedes eggs were collected each week, and 
women in particular were keen to be more involved in the activities 
related to health and showed interest in knowing how the system 
worked and learning how to maintain it. Among those surveyed 
who did not have ovillantas, many showed interest in having them 
installed at their households. In general, the impression was that the 
ovillantas were effective in reducing adult mosquitoes.
Among the health workers and manager interviewed, the training 
programme was said to motivate and strengthen their social and 
technical field work. Financial resources, vehicles, fuel and per-
sonnel were said to be scarce. They requested more research in 
the field, so they could further learn. They expressed concern that 
implementation of any new strategies be sustained.
Discussion
We found our three-component integrated intervention to have 
proved beneficial to this remote community at risk of mosquito-
borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The combi-
nation of health worker training, low-cost ecological ovillantas, and 
community engagement ensured the project met local needs and 
fostered collaboration and participation of the community, which 
can help improve sustainability.
The integrated involvement and web-based certification of local 
health workers strengthened expertise in the area, and has generated 
evidence of ecosystem alternatives against Aedes mosquitoes.
The ecological ovillantas, made out of recycled material (gar-
bage that when left in the field increases the potential of creating 
breeding sites), proved positive in the capture of Aedes eggs and 
possibly on the reduction of the adult mosquito populations. A 
remarkable acceptance and willingness to participate was observed, 
not only from the community but also from health workers who 
monitored its implementation. This was bolstered by community 
members learning and observing the early biological life stages of 
the vector, as well as observing the number of Aedes eggs collected 
in their households, which permitted them to relate those to the pres-
ence and quantities of adult mosquitoes potentially produced. It is 
possible that there may be a synergistic effect between the motiva-
tion to participate in the control of mosquitoes, using the innovative 
strategy of the ovillantas, and the complementary actions needed 
to maintain an orderly and clean house and backyard. This serves 
to avoid the creation of artificial breeding sites for the Ae aegypti 
mosquito and the transmission of viral infections.
Interestingly, a recent report by Ayres25 from the Brazilian Oswaldo 
Cruz Foundation described that species of mosquitoes other than 
Aedes can be infected with the Zika virus, including Culex spp. 
mosquitoes, in laboratory settings. Recent reporting from Bra-
zil has also affirmed concerns that infection with Zika virus of 
Culex mosquitoes is vastly more common than Aedes and is being 
overlooked in the prevention and control efforts26. So while the 
contribution of these other species to Zika transmission has not 
as yet been firmly established, we anticipate that our ovillanta 
approach could potentially be used to reduce populations of either 
species. For example, Culex restuans/pipiens mosquitoes were 
collected in the first Canadian study using a modified ovitrap. In 
the summer of 2007, approximately 3.2 million eggs (in rafts) were 
counted and destroyed in the city of Sudbury, Canada in a 90-day 
study, using 150 modified ovitraps, resulting in a 90% reduction of 
the adult Culex spp. population within the study sites (unpublished 
results Ulibarri et al.). The only requirement to attract a different 
species, or to have an effect on both Aedes and Culex mosquitoes 
in the region, is a change of the attractant solution used in the ovil-
lanta, or the set up of a second ovillanta with different attractant 
solution – the equipment stays the same.
In general, the level of knowledge that community members and 
health workers held about different viral infections was almost non-
existent and, at times, wrong. Clearly there is a need to carry out 
novel strategies aimed at gaining and maintaining the attention of 
Table 3. Dengue cases in the Sayaxche region (laboratory confirmed and extreme fever

 the community; traditional recommendations provided by health 
workers tend to bore them, they said. More dynamism is necessary, 
especially with children. In addition, it is important to include the 
active participation of infected patients with health centres to avoid 
further mosquito infection. In this way, infected symptomatic cases 
can be properly recorded and monitored, and the patient can be fol-
lowed accordingly.
The participation of the population in vector-borne disease preven-
tion and control is an area that requires more effort and attention. 
One aspect requiring sensitivity is the clear extent of individual-
ism within communities in this area of Guatemala, and the evident 
conflicts among different ethnic groups, mainly around culture 
and language. These work against social cohesion and participa-
tion. All the government groups responsible for ensuring health and 
safety require coordination and collaboration, including reducing 
the number of abandoned lots where mosquitoes breed. It would 
be beneficial for the government to apply an ecosystem approach27 
for the communal benefit and to establish a mechanism for people 
not to throw garbage on the streets and learn to recycle the same 
properly.
There were several limitations to our study.
Our project was not able to consider the inclusion of the epide-
miologic impact of the methodology on viral transmission using 
sequential polls of seroprevalence. However, the intensity of 
dengue transmission while the project developed was higher in 
cities close to Sayaxche, such as Las Cruces and La Libertad. Dur-
ing our study period, the reported incidence of dengue in 2015 for 
La Libertad, Las Cruces and Sayaxche was 3.33, 10.91 and 2.06 
per 10,000 pop., respectively. This was also a direct observation 
of the Director of the Program in Sayaxche with respect to the 
buffering effect possibly associated with the intervention using the 
ovillantas. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reports 
18,058 probable cases (1,228 laboratory-confirmed cases) across 
Guatemala in 201528 and 1,179 probable cases up to week 11 of 
2016. We ask ourselves, how has the city of Sayaxche been spared 
this national burden? The confirmed incidence in La Libertad was 
5.29 times higher than the ones registered in Sayaxche during the 
same year. The effectiveness of the ovillanta intervention on the 
reduction of dengue virus transmission within the city of Sayax-
che could be based on the fact that zero autochthonous cases were 
reported, and only three imported cases were confirmed (unpub-
lished data, Area de Salud Peten-Suroccidental). We remain cau-
tious and will continue to monitor the epidemiology closely. 
Second, while we believe the neighbourhoods and households 
shared the same or similar features in terms of sociodemographics, 
climate, and others, we did not specifically measure these variables. 
And although we systematically monitored the presence of back-
yard containers with larvae or potential water collection (in part 
through the entomological poll), their presence was not documented 
nor measured in households that may also have served as mosquito 
breeding places (i.e., tubs, drums, etc. that filled with rain water).
Third, we did not implement and complete the health worker 
training prior to initiating the second and third components of the 
study. The web-based training for health workers was provided 
simultaneously, showing that the trained personnel gained a better 
understanding of the vector control process and a better transfer of 
information to the community. All of the health workers involved 
in installing and monitoring the ovillantas undertook the web-based 
training, and only one failed to be accredited. We believe that early 
training of the personnel, prior to interacting with the community, 
might have produced better results. The fact that the community 
were already acquainted with most of the health workers enabled 
their acceptance of the community engagement activities and of the 
ovillantas study.
Nonetheless, our project provides evidence for a promising alterna-
tive to harmful pesticides and standard ovitraps at a time when the 
threat of viral outbreaks is increasing. By incorporating ecology 
and community-oriented elements, this alternative has the potential 
to be effectively scaled-up and be sustainable.

This article describes an intervention carried out in rural Guatemala consisting of comparing standard
vector control against an integrated delivery of a) web-based health worker training, b) low-cost ovitraps
(“ovillantas”) and c) community engagement. I agree with the other reviews and add the following:
 
The title is quite long. In the introduction make clearer that the modified ovitraps are called “ovillantes” (the
photo shows that but not in the introduction). To what extent do the authors think the ovillantes can be
replicated in other settings, e.g., urban? Why did the authors choose to work on 
 in a rural
Aedes aegypti
area, although 
 is mainly an urban vector? Would ovillantes be applicable in cities, in
Aedes aegypti
Guatemala or elsewhere in Latin America?
 
Pertinent research project in times of arboviral disease epidemics, however, under methods more clearly
describe study design and indicators used to measure intervention effectiveness and detail methods,
including methods in qualitative research. There is now growing evidence that community interventions
can in fact have an impact on the disease incidence and serological parameters  (recent publication on
Nicaragua), so there is a need for good research and strong evidence on the effect of community
interventions. This project did not do that, clearly spelled out in the discussion section, but the
methodology section could be strengthened by explaining the analytical (and not only descriptive)
elements of the study design.
 
The results suggest that ovillantes are more effective than standard ovitraps by comparing both
interventions in different neighborhoods (“study sites”). Clarify whether this is by cluster-randomization or
not.
 
Focus groups results are presented to show (positive) impact on social participation but they are not
presented by intervention areas so that the effect of the intervention on social participation  cannot clearly
be attributed.
 
As the article argues, the FGD results “can help guide future strategies geared to strengthen community
participation” but they do not fully indicate an  impact of the intervention. Also, while referring to the

participation” but they do not fully indicate an  impact of the intervention. Also, while referring to the
“community” and social participation the article refers to different ethnic groups and certain
“communication difficulties”: unclear what this refers to (aren’t all of the communities of Mayan descent?
What sub-groups or other ethnic groups is the article referring to?).

Title has been modified.
Sayaxche is a small city (urban) in an isolated area of Guatemala (rural).  All study was carried out
within the city limits.  Sayaxche was chosen because the high dengue cases in previous years. 
Yes, there are plans to implement the ovillantas in other cities, in Latin America, Asia, South

 mosquitoes are a problem, some people are already doing so.
Aedes
This is a publication explaining the preliminary results from a three-prong study, a new publication
will deal with the technical parts of the study, when data is more abundant.
We know that this publication might have been premature, when dealing with pure scientific data.
We trust that publishing these preliminary results early, could help more people given the urgency.
We believe that together we could learn more about the implementation of this simple/affordable
way to reduce 
 population, and in turn provide tools aimed at protecting vulnerable people
Aedes
Given the size of the city of Sayaxche, the ovillantas setting was ‘randomized’ in a manner that
most of the city was covered. Although, a slight preference was given to sections of the city where
most affected by dengue, based on previous years local data.
The aim of the study was to ‘study’ social participation at the same time as the effect of the ‘new’
ovillantas on amount of mosquitoes produced in the area. The social participation was clearly
present, the effect of the ovillantas was clearly demonstrated.  Now, we need to study the long
term effect of the combined methodology.
In this study in particular, we encountered a cultural ‘division’ among the different members of the
community.  At times, we required a translator to communicate with the ‘participants’ of the study,
given that their mother language was Mayan, not Spanish.  This difficulty might  or might no be
important, but needs to be considered while implementing these types of strategies in other
settings.
Cultural values in Mayan culture are different than most Western societies, thus we needed to
adapt to this challenge, and the outcome was positive.

Overall: Good example of intersectoral engagement and innovation in vector surveillance. The ovillanta
design, which the authors show to be a highly sensitive vector monitoring tool, is most important element
of this publication.  The paper needs to be strengthened through greater review of the literature in the
introduction and discussion, clarifying research methods especially social science methods, and clarifying
the data shown in the figures. The title is misleading (and some of the text), because the authors do not
demonstrate a reduction in 
 abundance.
Ae. aegypti
 
Introduction 
Paragraph 3. “The rapid spread of 
mosquitoes… began around 2000.” I’m not sure that this is
Ae. aegypti 
correct. I believe that Aedes reinvaded the Americas in the 1970s-80s, and dengue reemerged and
spread through the region in the 90s and 2000s. Please check other references.
 
Paragraph 4. Strengthen the discussion of Aedes surveillance tools. I suggest discussing currently
available ae aegypti surveillance techniques, the role of surveillance in disease control, and limitations of
current techniques. Are you comparing stationary vector surveillance/monitoring tools, vector control
tools, or integrated surveillance and vector control tools? Traditional ovitraps, human landing catches,
and bg sentinel traps all have slightly different objectives. Be sure to clarify this. I would suggest
refocusing on the role of ovitraps, and conducting a more comprehensive literature review of different
ovitraps currently on the market, their limitations and strengths. 
 
I suggest incorporating the paragraph about filtration and recycling into the subsequent paragraph so it is
easier for the reader to understand that the current study is based on prior well-developed studies
conducted in Canada. This will help with the flow of the intro.
 
How did you determine the most attracting solution? Lab based experiments? Please explain or cite prior
studies.
 
In the introduction, please clarify the objectives of the study, the study design, and the study endpoints
(e.g., increased education of health workers, number of Ae. aegypti eggs in XX communities).
 
Methods
I was a bit confused by the study design. Consider creating a diagram or map that depicts the study
design. Why were standard ovitraps used in the intervention community?
 
Egg counts are an indirect measure of adult female mosquito abundance (true entomological risk). Egg
counts are affected by the number of alternative breeding sites in the environment. Did you account for
other factors that could affect egg counts during the study period, such as differences in household
characteristics between the treatment and control sites, elimination of containers or other vector control
Page 16 of 23
F1000Research 2016, 5:598 Last updated: 16 MAY 2019
  
characteristics between the treatment and control sites, elimination of containers or other vector control
interventions?
 
Overall the social science research methods and results lack sufficient detail determine the validity of the
results. Three interviews is a small sample size. How do you know these are representative? Given the
small number of informants, this information could also be included as part of the local context in the
discussion section instead of presented as a result. How did you analyze the qualitative data from focus
groups and interviews? What social science research methods were used to analyze the transcribed
texts? Were the texts coded? Who did the coding? What software was used? Please include appropriate
description of the methods and references.
 
Please provide more detail regarding the entomological surveys. Did you empty and collect and count all
larvae/pupae from all containers? How were cisterns managed? Did you conduct the entomological
surveys in the control neighborhoods to ensure that there were no differences between treatment and
control sites? What dates/season did you conduct the surveys? The container positivity will vary greatly
by season.
 
Results
Can you summarize the results of the training evaluation survey in a table?
 
Strongly recommend showing summary statistics (maybe from the national census if not available from
study households?) to compare the characteristics of the the treatment and control communities or
households, to show that there were no major differences in housing conditions, demographics, access to
piped water, etc. which could influence differences in the egg count data. In my experience, subtle
differences in access to piped water can create completely different vector population dynamics even
within the same city.
 
Fig 2, left panel. This figure is supposed to show monthly egg counts by site (treatment and control), but
the legend indicates trap types rather than site types. This is confusing since both standard ovitraps and
ovillantas were used in the intervention site.
Fig 2, right panel. This figure is supposed to show monthly egg counts by site and by type of trap, but
there are 2 lines on the figure rather than 4. Please clarify.
 
Fig 3. Why did you fit a linear curve? There appears to be seasonality in the data, indicating a nonlinear
seasonal dynamic.
 
Please produce publication quality graphics, with consistent formatting and axes (e.g., epi weeks versus
months)
 
The investigators report that more eggs were collected from the intervention site with ovillantas.  This
clearly shows that ovillantas are a more sensitive surveillance tool. I think it is difficult to say whether they
are more effective at reducing the mosquito population, unless you have other entomological indicators to
show that the mosquito population was suppressed.
 
Discussion
The investigators indicate that the level of knowledge of community members about viral infections is low.
Please show these results in the results section.
 
Under study limitations, the major limitation (if the authors are claiming that the ovillanta is an effective
vector control tool) is the lack of data on adult 
 abundance or other entomological

vector control tool) is the lack of data on adult 
 abundance or other entomological
Aedes aegypti
indicators.
 
The investigators should broaden their discussion to discuss their findings in light of other studies
published regarding community dengue perception, alternative ovitrap designs that have been published
recently by R. Barrera and others, and the effectiveness of community participation in vector surveillance.
The discussion and introduction could be strengthened by a deeper review of the literature.
 
Other comments:
Please include a map of your study site.
The authors mention that they limited by lack of climate data. This information is available online. They
could download the data and and plot temperature and rainfall with Figure 3, to explain the seasonality.

This investigation incorporated three components to improve the control of 
, mosquito
Aedes aegypti
vector of dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses, in a remote urban community in Guatemala. The three
components were; use of web-based training in vector control for local health personnel, the development
of mosquito ovitraps made locally out of used tires and evaluation in a trapping survey and community
engagement activities. The authors are commended on the performance of a mosquito trap made from a
common waste item that normally contributes to mosquito production. The new traps, referred to as
ovillantas, caught more eggs per site, per device, than standard ovitraps.  
Although the title refers to the control of 
, which is the theme throughout the manuscript, the
Ae. aegypti
studies presented are not specifically tailored to measuring the success of the components in the context
of 
control (mosquito population reduction). For component one; web-based education of
Ae. aegypti 
health workers; a knowledge, action and practice (KAP) survey of the knowledge of health workers before
they undertook training could have assisted to determine the changes due to the training module. For
component two; data for the counts of mosquito larvae/pupae in different mosquito traps over time is
presented within treatment communities. While this provides promising data on the effectiveness of
ovillantas as trapping tools, there are no indication that the trapping had the effect of reducing the
mosquito population. Ecological ovillantas may prove to be excellent tools for monitoring mosquito
population numbers in resource limited settings, however more work is needed to establish their ability to
reduce mosquito population sizes.  The authors attempted to asses the effect of their intervention on
mosquito control by examining Dengue seroprevalence data, however low case numbers were reported
in official records and these are likely to be underestimates, limiting this approach. Adult mosquito
trapping would be another avenue to monitoring mosquito population changes. For component three,
several themes were identified among socioeconomic issues affecting mosquito control, however future
studies will be required to measure resulting improvements in community engagement.
In summary, a multi-component strategy towards the control of 
 is presented that incorporates
Ae. aegypti
training of health workers in vector control, a new mosquito ovitrap constructed from recycled materials
and community engagement activities. While an increase in trapping efficacy is demonstrated for the
ovillantas, it is difficult to gauge the effectiveness of these components on 
control from this
Ae. aegypti 
study alone. The title and theme may be better presented as "development of strategies

Although we tend to agree with the Mr. Hugo (reviewer),we clarify that this is a report on
preliminary data.  Entomological studies are necessary in order to establish with certainty that the
viral infection has been reduced.  Adult traps do not work very well in 
 spp. mosquitoes
Aedes
(reason for the use of standard ovitraps to monitor the presence of 
 females in the study
Aedes
area). Nevertheless adult traps are planned for the near future studies, something very difficult to
achieve in remote communities where commercial carbon dioxide is not easy to access.  A new
trap is being designed to overcome this difficulties, and results will be reported in due time.

Title and Abstract: I think these are both a little misleading. The integrated intervention was not
evaluated in such a way that would allow for rigorous evaluation (there were too few trial arms) – I think
the presented results can only be used to compare the two different trap types. The sentence in the
abstract that indicates the higher mosquito egg collections found using the novel trap is also misleading –
analysing total egg counts over the course of the experiment actually indicated higher captures with the
standard ovitrap.
 
 There are major issues with the study design. Not least of all, it does not allow for the

be a result of the lure as it was the new trap design. Although cost was mentioned several times in the

lure-baited water in their novel trap meaning any difference found between trap types could just as easily
be a result of the lure as it was the new trap design. Although cost was mentioned several times in the
study, no indication was provided of the relative costs of the new tested trap (plus lure and construction
time) versus the standard trap and so no conclusions could be drawn pertaining to cost effectiveness.
 
Recycling the water in the traps is a good idea in the short term because natural chemicals emitted by
ovipositing mosquitoes are attractive to future ovipositors. However, there must be an optimum duration
over which water can be recycled, beyond which the build-up of algae etc would actually be unattractive
to ovipositing females. This was never mentioned.
 
Lack of internet access in this remote population is something that perhaps should have been identified
as a major study limitation before the attempted use of web-based education services.
 
After community participation inevitably wanes and the eggs are no longer collected and routinely
removed/destroyed, the ovillantas will provide ideal breeding grounds for disease vectors. Part of the
study involved community education on eliminating breeding grounds from participant houses but these
‘traps’ sound as though they themselves will become ideal larval sites in time. The only ways around this
would be the removal of traps by trained personnel over a predetermined time period or the continual
surveillance of the local communities’ upkeep of the traps – both expensive and unlikely to occur.
 
Count data were analysed using t-tests. Count data are typically not normally distributed (typically they
are Poisson or negative/binomial distributed) and would require alternative analysis methods.
 
Minor issues in the content include the assertion that ovitraps have previously been shown to significantly
reduce adult mosquito numbers – to the best of my knowledge this is not the case. Also, the authors
mention that the 500m dispersal ability of

One of the novelties here was that people from the community did participate actively, using a
novel approach made out of items from their backyard.
Higher mosquito egg count was achieved on site with ovillantas against site with only standard
ovitrap.  Although, the reviewer is right that the ovitrap in ovillanta site collected more than the
ovitrap alone.  We are investigating this phenomenon and believe is due to the ‘skip oviposition’
nature of the 
 mosquito.

; We also compared water with ovillantas, against standard ovitraps, and at all time
Article content
the ovillantas collected about 2.5 times more eggs than standard ovillanta (data not shown).
We did find algae problem but in very few ovillantas.  The fact of filtering and recycling the solution
seemed to keep the solution clean for extended period of time.  When an ovillanta was polluted,
then the whole solution was replaced with fresh water plus attractant solution.
Internet accessibility at the Health Center was identified prior to implementation of the study.  What
was a problem, and we did not see it at the beginning, was that not everybody has access to
internet in their homes, and internet is extremely slow in the region.  Thus, it was necessary that
every single person travel to the Health Center for the ‘lessons’, an inconvenience to those far from
the Center.
; Absolutely, the same would happen if standard ovitraps were used.
Community participation
 For this reason, the Health personnel was trained to supervise the surveillance and cleanliness of
the ovillantas in a regular basis while gathering the information on egg count (pellon paper
exchange).  If the participant failed to maintain the ovillanta, this was removed from their premises
or the Health personnel took over the maintenance.  Very few instances of this happened.

being, we considered that the t-tests were enough to show the significant difference provided by
the use of ovillantas against standard ovitraps.
