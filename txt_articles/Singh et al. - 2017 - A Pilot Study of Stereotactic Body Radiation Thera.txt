Abstract
Purpose: While stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can
reduce tumor volumes in patients with metastatic renal cell
carcinoma (mRCC), little is known regarding the immunomod-
ulatory effects of high-dose radiation in the tumor microenviron-
ment. The main objectives of this pilot study were to assess the
safety and feasibility of nephrectomy following SBRT treatment of
patients with mRCC and analyze the immunological impact of
high-dose radiation.
Experimental Design: Human RCC cell lines were irradiated
and evaluated for immunomodulation. In a single-arm feasibility
study, patients with mRCC were treated with 15 Gray SBRT at the
primary lesion in a single fraction followed 4 weeks later by
cytoreductive nephrectomy. RCC specimens were analyzed for
tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expression and T-cell infiltration.
The trial has reached accrual (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01892930).
Results: RCC cells treated in vitro with radiation had increased
TAA expression compared with untreated tumor cells. Fourteen
patients received SBRT followed by surgery, and treatment was
well-tolerated. SBRT-treated tumors had increased expression of
the immunomodulatory molecule calreticulin and TAA (CA9,
5T4, NY-ESO-1, and MUC-1). Ki67þ -proliferating CD8þ T cells
and FOXP3þ cells were increased in SBRT-treated patient speci-
mens in tumors and at the tumor–stromal interface compared
with archived patient specimens.
Conclusions: It is feasible to perform nephrectomy fol-
lowing SBRT with acceptable toxicity. Following SBRT, patient
RCC tumors have increased expression of calreticulin, TAA, as
well as a higher percentage of proliferating T cells compared
with archived RCC tumors. Collectively, these studies pro-
vide evidence of immunomodulation following SBRT in
mRCC. Clin Cancer Res; 23(17); 5055–65. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma represents 3% of adult malignancies,
and approximately one quarter of patients present with met-
astatic disease (1). Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is
especially difficult to treat with a 5-year overall survival rate of
approximately
10%
(2).
Immunotherapeutic
approaches
including conventional cytokine therapy (3), recently devel-
oped immune checkpoint inhibitor strategies (4), and dendritic
cell vaccination (5) have shown promise in the treatment of
mRCC with a subset of patients having complete, durable
responses following therapy.
The emphasis of most immunotherapeutic regimens is to
increase the number and improve the cytolytic function of
tumor-specific T cells. This focus largely overlooks the tumor-
intrinsic barriers to effective T-cell–mediated killing including
T-cell trafficking to the tumor microenvironment (6), presence
of immunosuppressive cells (7), and expression of immunogenic
antigens by tumors cells (8). mRCC is a heavily lymphocyte
infiltrated tumor type with low and heterogeneous expression of
tumor-associated antigens (TAA; refs. 9, 10).
Diminished TAA expression is a well-characterized mecha-
nism of immune evasion employed within the tumor micro-
environment (8). Radiation-induced inflammation in tumors
has the potential to overcome this impediment by releasing
pro-inflammatory mediators, upregulating TAA, and increasing
T-cell infiltration (11). A growing body of evidence has also
demonstrated that sublethal doses of radiation can induce
expression of calreticulin and CD80, leading to increased
cytotoxic lymphocyte activity following irradiation of tumor

 cells (12–14). Preclinical tumor models and in vitro data uti-
lizing other tumor types have revealed that radiotherapy can
increase TAA expression (13, 15). While RCC appears resistant
to conventional fractionated radiotherapy (16), recent publica-
tions have shown that high doses delivered with modern
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can produce local con-
trol with limited toxicity (17, 18). Treatment of patients with
SBRT in combination with conventional high-dose IL2 treat-
ment
has
demonstrated
partial
and
complete
objective
responses in patients with melanoma and mRCC that correlate
with increased proliferating T cells in peripheral blood (17).
While dozens of clinical trials are currently investigating the
combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy for treat-
ment of malignancies (19), the isolated contributions of high-
dose radiation in preconditioning patient tumors for effective
antitumor responses remain unknown.
The capacity of SBRT to control growth of primary tumors and
the finding that resection of primary tumors may improve overall
survival of patients with mRCC (20) led us to consider a com-
bination of these treatments. First, we performed in vitro studies to
explore the effects and timing of immune changes caused by high-
dose irradiation as a surrogate for SBRT. These studies informed
the design of a first in-human pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility
and safety of combining single-fraction SBRT with cytoreductive
nephrectomy.
Patients and Methods
Cell culture sample preparation and treatment
These studies were performed according to a protocol approv-
ed by the Roswell Park Cancer Institute Institutional Review
Board (IRB). A498 human kidney carcinoma cells (ATCC) were
cultured at 37�C in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning Inc.) at 200,000
cells per flask in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 0.05 mmol/L
of 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific),
1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate,
20 mmol/L of HEPES, 1% non-essential amino acids, and
2 mmol/L of L-glutamine (Corning Inc.). Culture media were
refreshed every other day. A Shepherd Mark I Model 68, 4000 Ci
Cesium 137 source irradiator (J.L. Shepherd and Associates),
was used to irradiate cells, with a total dose rate of 12 or 16 Gray
(Gy). Cells were trypsinized with 0.125% trypsin-EDTA (Ther-
moFisher Scientific). ELISPOT assays were performed using NY-
ESO-1–specific T-cell clones generated as described previously
(21). A498 target cells previously treated with or without
radiation were plated at a 1:1 ratio with NY-ESO-1–specific
CD8þ T cells in 96-well plates (EMD Millipore) and later
evaluated for IFNg secretion using C.T.L. ImmunoSpot Analyzer
(Cellular Technologies).
Patients
We report results of a single-center, IRB-approved pilot study
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01892930). All patients pro-
vided written informed consent, and the study was conducted in
accordance to all applicable local regulatory requirements and
laws. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age, had mRCC, and
were deemed fit for cytoreductive surgery to the primary tumor
site. The exclusion criteria included: any chemotherapy, any
radiotherapy, or investigational agent within 30 days prior to
enrollment or radiation to the primary tumor at any point prior to
treatment.
Patients with mRCC received 15-Gy SBRT to the primary tumor
on day 1 followed by nephrectomy on day 29 (�3 days). This dose
was chosen on the basis of our recent experience with this
treatment being well-tolerated in patients with inoperable RCC
(18). Patients were followed for protocol-related toxicity 30 � 3
days following surgery or until resolution of any toxicity. There-
after, patients were followed as clinically indicated. An interim
analysis for safety was conducted after the first five patients were
treated. The study was then allowed to proceed. The data safety
monitoring board of Roswell Park Cancer Institute reviewed this
study annually.
SBRT and nephrectomy
SBRT was delivered as previously described (18). Briefly, a
stereotactic body immobilization system(BodyFIX, Medical Intel-
ligence) was used with a 4-dimensional CT to assess tumor
motion with respiration. Tumor delineation was carried out in
all respiratory phases, creating an internal target volume, and then
a 5-mm isotropic expansion was used to create a planning target
volume (PTV). Treatment was carried out with a Varian True-
Beam linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems). Volumetric
modulated arc therapy with 6-MV photons was used. On the day
of treatment, cone-beam CT was obtained following setup on the
treating machine, and appropriate shifts were made.
Archival tumor specimens
Archival tumor specimens were obtained from patients who
underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy for RCC and had given
written consent for research use of a portion of the pathologic
specimen. An independent broker, a person not associated with
this research study, linked demographic and follow-up data with
specimens to allow analysis. Archival specimens utilized in flow
cytometric experiments were from nine women and seven men,
resected between 2011 and 2015. Median age for this group was
60 years (range, 41–72 years; Supplementary Table S1). The
control cohort utilized in immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis
consisted of two women and nine men with a median age of
69 years (range, 45–80 years; Supplementary Table S1).
Translational Relevance
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is a lethal disease
that, in some instances, can be treated long-term with
immune-mediated strategies. Effective antitumor responses
require intratumoral T-cell infiltration, detection of tumor-
associated antigens (TAA), and initiation of tumor cell lysis.
Immunotherapy of RCC is challenged by poor TAA expression.
Radiation increases TAA in multiple tumor types, but data in
mRCC are scarce. The advent of stereotactic body radiotherapy
(SBRT) allows delivery of radiation to well-defined areas with
limited collateral damage. We performed a clinical trial to
assess the feasibility of surgery following SBRT and analyze the
intratumoral immune landscape after SBRT. We found that
cytoreductive nephrectomy was feasible following SBRT and
show for the first time that patient tumors treated with SBRT
have increased TAA expression and intratumoral Ki67þ T-cell
infiltration. The immunomodulatory effects of SBRT provide
rationale
for
combining
SBRT
with
immune-activating
approaches including checkpoint inhibition and vaccination.

 Patient sample preparation
Under sterile conditions, RCC patient tumor samples were
minced into small pieces and exposed to collagenase/hyaluron-
idase (collagenase 1 mg/mL, hyaluronidase 0.1 mg/mL, Sigma-
Aldrich) digestive solution for 120 minutes. Samples were filtered
through 100-mm cell strainers, washed with PBS, and stored at
�80�C.
Flow cytometry
Cells were isolated, washed in PBS, and stained with Zombie
UV Fixable Viability Kit for 10 minutes (Cat# 423108 2.5:100,
BioLegend). Flow cytometric analysis was performed after
staining with antibodies (Supplementary Table S2). NY-ESO-
1 was detected with rat anti-mouse IgG1 secondary antibody
(cat# 550083 PE 1:100, BD Biosciences). For intracellular
staining, cells were washed and incubated with Fixation/Per-
meabilization Solution Kit (Cat# 554714, BD Biosciences).
Cells were stained for expression of intracellular NY-ESO-1
and labeled with PE secondary antibody and fixed in 2%
formaldehyde solution.
Flow cytometric analysis was performed on BD LSR Fortessa
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For adjustment, control cells
were stained with each individual fluorochrome to serve
as compensation controls. The outcome was analyzed using
FlowJo_V10 cytometry software.
IHC analysis
IHC assays for Ki67 & CD8 double stain, FOXP3, CD68, PD-L1,
CD31, and vimentin were performed by the Pathology Network
Shared Resource at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (see Supple-
mentary Table S3 for antibody information). Sections (4–5 mm)
were placed on charged slides and dried at 60�C for 1 hour, then
cooled to room temperature, deparaffinized in three changes of
xylene, and rehydrated using graded alcohols. For antigen retriev-
al, slides were submerged in either Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9
(Dako) or EDTA buffer, pH 8 (ThermoFisher Scientific), and
heated in a steamer (Supplementary Table S3), followed by a
cooldown at room temperature for 20 minutes. Endogenous
peroxidases were quenched with aqueous 3% H2O2 for 10 min-
utes and washed with PBS/T. Slides were loaded onto a DAKO
autostainer (Dako), and serum-free protein block was applied for
5 minutes, blown off, and then primary antibody was applied
(Supplementary Table S3). An irrelevant isotype-matched anti-
body was applied on replicate slides instead of primary antibody
as a negative control. The EnVisionþ Peroxidase system or G2
System/AP (Dako), PowerVision system (Leica), and/or the
Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and correspond-
ing chromogens were used for visualization (Supplementary
Table S3). Finally, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated, cleared, and cover slipped.
Slides were digitally scanned using Aperio ScanScope (Aperio
Technologies, Inc.) with 20 � bright-field microscopy. Once
scanned, Aperio ImageScope version 11.2.0.780 (Aperio Techno-
logies, Inc.) was used to view images for analysis. Slide image data
fields were populated; images were examined for quality and
amended as necessary. Annotation layers were created for each
image representing tumor and interface regions with analysis
performed on an average of four fields per tumor. Areas of target
cells for image analysis were circled with care taken to avoid areas
with staining artifacts or red blood cells using the negative free-
form pen.
Proliferating (Ki67þ) CD8þ T cells were quantified using Aper-
io's Image analysis tools as follows. Ki67 is expected to be present
in the nuclei of many cell types in the tumor microenvironment.
Genie software was, therefore, first trained to recognize CD8þ T
lymphocytes to limit Ki67 analysis to this cell population. Once
training was complete, the fully trained Genie was saved and
applied as a classifier prior to the basic nuclear algorithm. This
combined approach provided the total number of CD8þ lym-
phocytes and the percentage of Ki67þ, proliferating CD8þ T cells
within the area of analysis.
Statistical analyses
The primary purpose of this study was to demonstrate the
feasibility of conducting a nephrectomy in patients receiving
SBRT for mRCC. Eligible patients who had nephrectomy
were considered evaluable for statistical analysis. SBRT compli-
cation rates were quantified as the binomial proportion of
evaluable patients with at least one surgical complication
related to SBRT. The plausible upper limit for the true SBRT
complication rate was estimated using a one-sided 95%
Clopper–Pearson confidence interval. Comparisons of SBRT-
treated patient specimens with archival samples were perform-
ed using independent-sample Student t tests. Overall survival
was defined as the number of months between SBRT initiation
and death from any cause. Patients who were still alive at the
time of analysis were censored at the date of last follow-up. The
overall survival distribution was described using the Kaplan–
Meier estimator. Throughout, P < 0.05 was deemed statistically
significant. The P values have not been adjusted for multiplic-
ity. All statistical analyses were done using PRISM v6.07
(GraphPad Software).
Results
Irradiation increases immune recognition of human RCC cells
in vitro
Initial in vitro studies focused on the sensitivity of human
RCC A498 cells to radiation-induced immunomodulation. We
found a higher percentage of tumor cells expressed calreticulin,
CD80, and HSP70 on live A498 cells following treatment with
either 12 or 16 Gy compared with untreated RCC cells (Fig. 1A).
These changes were consistent when evaluating mean fluores-
cence intensity (MFI; Supplementary Fig. S1A) and occurred as
early as 24 hours after radiation treatment. A498 displayed an
increased percentage of cells expressing CD86 and increased
CD54 MFI (Supplementary Fig. S1B) following radiation. Irra-
diation of A498 cells also increased the percentage of cells
expressing TAA as early as 24 hours (NY-ESO-1), with all TAA
(CA9, 5T4, MUC-1, and intracellular NY-ESO-1) expressed at
higher levels at 96 hours posttreatment with either radiation
dose (Fig. 1B). MFIs of CA9, MUC-1, and intracellular NY-ESO-
1 were also increased on A498 cells treated with radiation
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Previous studies showing calreticu-
lin binds NY-ESO-1 protein at the cell surface (22), led us to
evaluate membrane expression of NY-ESO-1. We determined
that radiation increased surface expression of NY-ESO-1 as early
as 72 hours after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Impor-
tantly, as studies have shown radiation can increase autofluor-
escence (23), we found a minimal contribution of nonspecific
staining for any isotype control antibody and fluorochrome
combination (Supplementary Fig. S2C).

 To directly assess whether TAA-specific CD8þ T cells were more
responsive to irradiated RCC tumor cells expressing higher levels
of TAA, we performed co-culture experiments with NY-ESO-1–
specific CD8þ T cells and evaluated IFNg secretion by ELISPOT. In
these experiments, more antigen-specific CD8þ T cells secreted
IFNg when cultured with A498 cells that were irradiated 96 hours
prior to co-culture (Fig. 1C).
Study cohort
A total of 16 patients were enrolled between July 2013 and
November 2015 (Table 1). The median age at diagnosis was
63.9 years (range, 52–75 years). Patients were treatment-na€
�ve
prior to SBRT therapy, but many received systemic treatment
following nephrectomy (Table 1). SBRT was successfully per-
formed in all patients per study specifications. Patient #2
(intracranial bleeding from a small, previously unknown brain
metastasis) died prior to surgery. This prompted the require-
ment of brain imaging prior to SBRT to rule out immune-
mediated intracranial side effects. Patient #11 had known
spinal disease (outside of SBRT field), developed cord com-
pression 12 days following SBRT, and therefore did not have
nephrectomy. She died 12 months after SBRT. The remaining
14 patients underwent nephrectomies. Twelve patients had
clear cell RCC, whereas patient #4 was found to have a high-
grade papillary urothelial carcinoma and patient #8 showed
chromophobe RCC. Tumor type can influence TAA expression
and infiltration. Therefore, we limited our remaining analysis
to patients with clear cell histology.
The median planning target volume (PTV) for SBRT was 441
cc (range, 37–1,241 cc) for clear cell patients. Respiratory gating
to treat the tumor only at prespecified points in the respiratory
cycle and active breath hold techniques were both allowed. A

 15-Gy dose was prescribed to the PTV. The maximum percent
dose 2 cm from the PTV ranged from 57 to 89 and generally
increased with increasing PTV size. The ratio of the intermediate
dose spillage at 50% of the prescription dose volume and the
PTV (R50%) was measured to describe the dose gradient. The
average R50% was 3.67 (range, 2.97–4.32.). Two weeks after
SBRT, CT scans were performed. There were no significant
changes from baseline in any scan.
Intraoperatively, there was a noticeable degree of perinephric
fibrosis. This made the dissection of the retroperitoneal space a
bit more challenging at times. Kocherizing the duodenum was
difficult for patient #1, but no intraoperative complications
were encountered.
Three patients had partial nephrectomies and 11 had total
nephrectomies. Blood loss averaged 100 cc. The planned
type of nephrectomy was not changed following SBRT. There
were no post-surgical complications in the 14 patients who
received surgery. Using a one-sided 95% Clopper–Pearson
confidence limit, the true SBRT complication rate is likely less
than 0.23.
Treatment-related adverse events are shown (Table 2). One

 were nausea and vomiting occurring in 44% and 38% of patients,
respectively. Of the 16 patients, four (25%) suffered grade II acute
toxicity. One- and 2-year overall survival estimates are 71% and
48%, respectively, and all patients still alive have been followed
for a minimum of 16 months (Table 1).
Surface expression of immunomodulatory molecules and
TAAs in archival control and study cohort tumors

to identify live tumor cells (CD45�) or leukocytes (CD45þ)
within single-cell suspensions (Supplementary Fig. S3A and

of
calreticulin
was

treated by SBRT (Fig. 2A). The expression of surface molecules
CD80, HSP70, MHC I, and CD86 were unchanged when
comparing SBRT-treated patient tumor cells with the archival
cohort (Fig. 2B and C; Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).
CD54þ (ICAM-1) expression was decreased in SBRT-treated
samples compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Analysis of TAA expression (CA9, MUC1, 5T4, and NY-ESO-
1) by flow cytometry showed increased expression in SBRT-
treated specimens compared with the control cohort, in terms
of both the percentage of tumor cells expressing TAA and the
expression level of TAA (Fig. 3A–D). Further analysis demon-
strated that surface expression of NY-ESO-1 was increased in
SBRT samples compared with archived control samples (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4D).
Increased immune infiltration in SBRT-treated RCC tumors
compared with control cohort
To evaluate CD8þ T-cell infiltration within intratumoral and
peritumoral regions following SBRT treatment, we performed
two-color IHC staining of nephrectomy specimens for CD8þ T
cells and Ki67 as a marker of proliferation. We observed no
differences in CD8þ T-cell infiltration within the tumor or at the
tumor–stromal interface following SBRT compared with control
nephrectomy specimens (Fig. 4A and B). However, when we
focused our analysis on proliferating cells, we observed that the
density of Ki67þ CD8þ cells was increased in SBRT samples
compared with control (Fig. 4A and B). Similar to our findings
by IHC that CD8þ density was not increased, characterization of
the T-cell infiltrate by flow cytometry demonstrated no change in
the number of CD4þ or CD8þ T cells in resected tumors (Sup-
plementary Fig. S5A). However, the percentage of CD4þ T cells
that expressed the immune checkpoint protein PD-1 was
increased in SBRT-treated specimens (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
Further investigation into the immune cell infiltrate showed
increased FOXP3þ cell and CD68þ macrophage accumulation
in SBRT-treated samples (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S5B).
We performed additional analysis to investigate the effects of
SBRT on the tumor stroma. We evaluated vascular density in
SBRT-treated tumors and observed no difference (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S5C). However, expression of vimentin, a common
fibroblast marker which can be expressed on endothelial cells
and RCC, was increased in SBRT samples compared with
Figure 2.

Discussion
This unique prospective pilot trial demonstrates that single-
fraction, 15-Gy SBRT followed by nephrectomy for mRCC: (i)
is feasible and well-tolerated, (ii) induced tumor-intrinsic
changes (increased calreticulin and TAA expression), and (iii)
increased the percentage of proliferating CD8þ T cells in pri-
mary tumors.
Overall, SBRT followed by nephrectomy was safe. The single
grade III treatment-related adverse event occurred in a patient
with a pre-existing history of anemia who received a transfu-
sion following SBRT. Grade II acute toxicity occurred in only
25% of patients. There were no grade III or higher surgical
complications, and the qualitative clinical assessment of the
surgeons was that SBRT did not make surgery appreciably
more difficult. There are two published reports, with a total of
four patients, of histologic examination of kidney tissue fol-
lowing SBRT. Onishi and colleagues reported autopsy data on
a patient treated with 60 Gy in 10 fractions who died 2.5 years
later of unrelated causes showing that some viable renal
cancer cells remained (25). Ponski and colleagues performed
surgery in three patients 8 weeks after 16 Gy was delivered in
four fractions and showed a complete response in one patient
(26). Consistent with our findings that SBRT prior to surgery
was well-tolerated, there were no acute or late toxicities within
the first year of follow-up.
However, it must be noted that two patients (intracranial
bleed and cord compression) on this trial did not receive their
planned surgery because of tumor progression soon after, but
far distant from the irradiated area. These may have been
random events of disease progression and were officially coded

 as such. Yet, the patient with initial cord compression from
known vertebral body metastases remained alive with good
function for one year following neurosurgical decompression.
Notably, similar events (described as pseudo-progression) have
been seen with nivolumab in a small number of patients with
mRCC (27) and a variety of other immune agents as summa-
rized by Chiou and Burrato (28). It is therefore also possible
that disease progression events noted in this trial are partly the
result of swelling from infiltration of immune cells.
SBRT has been shown, in preclinical models, to induce both
stimulating and suppressive immune effects within the tumor
microenvironment (7). The balance between stimulation and
suppression may depend on tumor type, radiation dose, and
number of fractions (14), as well as the time of observation.
Clinically, a wide range of SBRT fractions (1–10) and doses
(18–60 Gy) for inoperable RCC have been reported in the
literature (29). In this study, 15 Gy in one fraction was utilized
due to three factors: (i) clinical experience with this dose being
well-tolerated in our inoperable patients (18), (ii) radiobio-
logical data suggesting vascular effects with this dose (30), and
(iii) in vitro experiments (Fig. 1) showing that this dose has
immunomodulatory effects.
Experiments performed in vitro found significant upregula-
tion of both immunomodulatory markers (calreticulin, CD80,
and HSP70, Fig. 1A) and TAAs (MUC1, NY-ESO-1, CA9, and
5T4, Fig. 1B) following radiation. These findings are consistent
with data that radiation-induced tumor cell death can promote
antitumor immunity through surface expression of calreticulin

 and secretion of immunogenic proteins (31). Radiotherapy has
been shown to increase expression of calreticulin (12, 32) while
enhancing expression of costimulatory molecules (15, 33) and
TAA (15) on live tumor cells. The finding of increased IFN g
secretion from NY-ESO-1–specific T cells following co-culture
with an irradiated human renal tumor cell line (Fig. 1C) is
consistent with data showing that irradiation can improve
tumor cell sensitivity to effector CD8þ T-cell–mediated cytol-
ysis (34).
Consistent with our in vitro findings that surface expression
of calreticulin can be induced on RCC cells surviving radiation
treatment (Fig. 1A), we found an increase in calreticulin ex-
pression on samples resected from patients treated by SBRT
(Fig. 2A). Contrary to our in vitro data, the expression of
previously identified radio-inducible surface molecules CD80,
HSP70, MHC I, (33, 35, 36), as well as CD86 and PD-L1 were
unchanged
when
comparing
SBRT-treated
patient
tumor
cells with the archival cohort (Fig. 2B and C; Supplementary
Figs. S4A and S4B and S5E). Unexpectedly, expression of CD54
(ICAM-1) was decreased on SBRT-treated human tumor (Sup-
plementary Fig. S5C), which is in contrast to previous reports
showing that radiation can increase CD54 expression on tumor
cell lines (15).
Immunostimulation results from two basic mechanisms in
preclinical models: (i) direct killing of tumor cells by radiation
increases the availability and cross-presentation of TAA to
CD8þ T cells (12, 15) and (ii) immune changes resulting from
cytokine production, particularly IFNg. Radiation doses as low
as 10 Gy have been shown to increase TAA expression in
numerous cell lines (15, 34), but few studies have addressed
TAA expression in human tumors treated in vivo (37). Fur-
thermore, previous work utilizing conventional radiation has
shown RCC to be refractory to treatment (16). We selected the
TAAs CA9, MUC-1, 5T4, and NY-ESO-1 which are overex-
pressed in RCC patient tumors compared with normal tissues
(38–40) and were increased by radiation in our in vitro studies
(Fig. 1B).
Our finding of NY-ESO-1 and MUC-1 upregulation in mRCC
patient tumors following 15-Gy SBRT (Fig. 3) is supported
by published in vitro studies showing an upregulation of these
TAAs in multiple non-RCC cell lines following ionizing radiation
(13, 37). Similarly, CA9 was found to be elevated following SBRT
in our study (Fig. 3). This upregulation is a novel finding and is
particularly significant, as CA9 is a known prognostic factor in
RCC; in a meta-analysis of 15 studies with 2,611 patients with
RCC, low expression was associated with poor disease-specific
survival (41).
We observed higher levels of proliferating CD8þ T cells and
FOXP3þ T regulatory cells (Tregs) without changes in overall
CD8þ T-cell numbers or tumor size from baseline, suggesting
the presence of additional mechanisms preventing CD8þ T-cell
infiltration and cytolytic function (Fig. 4B and C; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S5A). Lower intratumoral ratios of CD8þ T cells to
Tregs may indicate poor prognosis (42, 43), providing rationale
for strategic inhibition of Tregs with SBRT to promote antitu-
mor responses. Studies have shown increased intratumoral
proliferating CD8þ T cells in patients who respond to immune
checkpoint inhibitors (24), providing additional support for
a combined SBRT and immune checkpoint blockade strategy
which has been the subject of numerous investigations (43,
44). Previous studies demonstrating that a single dose of
radiation can induce durable immune responses to antigen
that are still observed weeks after treatment (45) also suggest
that increased Ki67þ CD8þ intratumoral T cells may indicate a
sustained systemic immune response.
Gene expression analysis and IHC studies have characterized
RCC as a heavily lymphocyte-infiltrated tumor type with high
levels of cytolytic activity (10, 46). However, unlike other
tumor types, abundant CD8þ T-cell infiltration is associated
with shorter overall survival in RCC (10). Conversely, a high
proliferative capacity of intratumoral CD8þ T cells, evaluated
by Ki67 staining, is associated with longer survival in RCC (10).
Park and colleagues found a similar increase in tumor-reactive
CD8þ T cells in murine models of renal cell cancer and
melanoma treated with SBRT; moreover, they found that this
effect was enhanced in mice treated with PD-1 blockade and in
PD-1 knockout mice (47). Recent human studies have shown
that higher levels of intratumoral proliferating T cells are
prognostic indicators for response to immune checkpoint
inhibition strategies. Immune checkpoint blockade has also
been shown to increase intratumoral proliferating T cells in
responding patients (24, 43). Interestingly, tyrosine kinase
inhibitors may also improve the proliferative capacity of intra-
tumoral lymphocytes in patients with RCC (48) and thus may
provide another treatment option to bolster endogenous anti-
tumor immune responses.
A significant limitation of this study is the single observa-
tion of patient tumors 4 weeks after SBRT treatment. This
snapshot of the tumor microenvironment following radiation
does not reflect the dynamic process that may have occurred
earlier. As others have noted in preclinical murine models and
in vitro studies, increased immune infiltration and expression
of immunomodulatory molecules including MHC I occurs
early following radiation before returning to baseline levels
(11, 33). Furthermore, while FOXP3þ Treg cell and macro-
phage infiltration were increased at this time point, these cells
may be functioning in an anti-inflammatory role weeks after a
local immune response was triggered. The observation of the
tumor microenvironment at this single time point (28 days
after SBRT) does not allow this investigation to delineate early
and late responses to treatment and the plasticity of the
immune cell subsets within the tumor microenvironment.
Specifically, intratumoral macrophages could have protu-
morigenic,
angiogenic,
and
immunosuppressive
function
within RCC tumors leading to immune dysfunction (49,
50). Conversely, macrophages within RCC can also promote
cytotoxic function (50). The impact of radiation on the
behavior of these cells within the RCC lesions is an open
area of investigation. The extension of our findings on immu-
nomodulation to patient survival are also limited by the
number of patients, lack of a pretreatment biopsy for com-
parison, as well as the varied treatments following enrollment
in this trial (Table 1).
In conclusion, this trial is the first to demonstrate that
nephrectomy following SBRT to the primary tumor is safe and
feasible. These data demonstrate for the first time that SBRT
can make significant changes to the immune landscape
within primary RCC lesions, which may impact the efficacy of
immunotherapies.
