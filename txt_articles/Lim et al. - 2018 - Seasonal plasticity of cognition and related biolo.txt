Abstract
Background
There are few data concerning the association between season and cognition and its neuro-
biological correlates in older persons—effects with important translational and therapeutic
implications for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). We aimed to mea-
sure these effects.
Methods and findings
We analyzed data from 3,353 participants from 3 observational community-based cohort
studies of older persons (the Rush Memory and Aging Project [MAP], the Religious Orders
Study [ROS], and the Minority Aging Research Study [MARS]) and 2 observational mem-
ory-clinic-based cohort studies (Centre de Neurologie Cognitive [CNC] study at Lariboisière
Hospital and the Sunnybrook Dementia Study [SDS]). We performed neuropsychological
testing and, in subsets of participants, evaluated cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, stan-
dardized structured autopsy measures, and/or prefrontal cortex gene expression by RNA
sequencing. We examined the association between season and these variables using
nested multiple linear and logistic regression models. There was a robust association
between season and cognition that was replicated in multiple cohorts (amplitude = 0.14 SD
[a measure of the magnitude of seasonal variation relative to overall variability; 95% CI
0.07–0.23], p = 0.007, in the combined MAP, ROS, and MARS cohorts; amplitude = 0.50

 SD [95% CI 0.07–0.66], p = 0.017, in the SDS cohort). Average composite global cognitive
function was higher in the summer and fall compared to winter and spring, with the differ-
ence equivalent in cognitive effect to 4.8 years’ difference in age (95% CI 2.1–8.4, p =
0.002). Further, the odds of meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia were
higher in the winter and spring (odds ratio 1.31 [95% CI 1.10–1.57], p = 0.003). These
results were robust against multiple potential confounders including depressive symptoms,
sleep, physical activity, and thyroid status and persisted in cases with AD pathology. More-
over, season had a marked effect on cerebrospinal fluid Aβ 42 level (amplitude 0.30 SD
[95% CI 0.10–0.64], p = 0.003), which peaked in the summer, and on the brain expression
of 4 cognition-associated modules of co-expressed genes (m6: amplitude = 0.44 SD [95%
CI 0.21–0.65], p = 0.0021; m13: amplitude = 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.27–0.76], p = 0.0009;
m109: amplitude = 0.43 SD [95% CI 0.24–0.67], p = 0.0021; and m122: amplitude 0.46 SD
[95% CI 0.20–0.71], p = 0.0012), which were in phase or anti-phase to the rhythms of cogni-
tion and which were in turn associated with binding sites for several seasonally rhythmic
transcription factors including BCL11A, CTCF, EGR1, MEF2C, and THAP1. Limitations
include the evaluation of each participant or sample once per annual cycle, reliance on self-
report for measurement of environmental and behavioral factors, and potentially limited gen-
eralizability to individuals in equatorial regions or in the southern hemisphere.
Conclusions
Season has a clinically significant association with cognition and its neurobiological corre-
lates in older adults with and without AD pathology. There may be value in increasing
dementia-related clinical resources in the winter and early spring, when symptoms are likely
to be most pronounced. Moreover, the persistence of robust seasonal plasticity in cognition
and its neurobiological correlates, even in the context of concomitant AD pathology, sug-
gests that targeting environmental or behavioral drivers of seasonal cognitive plasticity, or
the key transcription factors and genes identified in this study as potentially mediating these
effects, may allow us to substantially improve cognition in adults with and without AD.

 • We tested their thinking and concentration, measured Alzheimer-disease-related pro-
teins in their spinal fluid, performed autopsies on those who died, and measured brain
gene expression.
• We found that older adults with and without dementia have better thinking and concen-
tration in the late summer and early fall than in the winter and spring.
• This was accompanied by seasonal rhythms in Alzheimer-disease-related proteins in the
spinal fluid, and in the expression of specific genes in the brain, giving us a window into
the underlying mechanisms.
What do these findings mean?
• There may be benefit to increasing dementia diagnosis and care resources in the winter
and early spring, when individuals’ thinking and concentration are at their worst.
• By shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the seasonal improvement in cogni-
tion in the summer, these findings also open the door to new avenues of treatment for
Alzheimer disease.
Introduction
Seasonal rhythms modulate several aspects of human behavior and physiology including brain
functions such as mood in seasonal affective disorder [1], symptom onset in schizophrenia [2],
and functional MRI (fMRI) brain responses to cognitive tasks [3]. Several studies suggest that
season may modulate cognition in younger adults [4,5], although this is not a universal finding
[3,6,7], and data from older adults are lacking.
Demonstration of seasonal modulation of cognition and its neural substrates in older
adults would have important clinical and translational implications. It would suggest that
Alzheimer disease (AD) might be a seasonal illness, and that dementia care resources should
be targeted to seasons of peak need, both to identify those at the earliest stages of disease, and
to support patients when they are most vulnerable. Seasonal modulation may account for the
observation that some individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subsequently
revert to normal cognition, and may be an important source of diagnostic misclassification
both in clinical trials and in clinical practice. Most importantly, it may shed light on mecha-
nisms of cognitive plasticity that might be leveraged to improve cognition in patients with
AD.
We recently demonstrated seasonal rhythms in human neocortical gene expression in older
adults with and without AD [8], In the present study of 3,353 older adults with and without
AD in the United States, France, and Canada, we tested the hypotheses that season has a signif-
icant association with cognition, the odds of being diagnosed with MCI or dementia, cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, and the expression of cognition-associated modules of co-
expressed genes in the human brain.

 Methods
Study design and participants
We analyzed cross-sectional data at multiple time points from participants in 3 prospective
observational community-based cohort studies of older persons (the Rush Memory and Aging
Project [MAP], Religious Orders Study [ROS], and Minority Aging Research Study [MARS])
and 2 prospective observational clinic-based case series (the Centre de Neurologie Cognitive
[CNC] study, at Lariboisière Hospital, University of Paris Diderot, and Assistance Publique–
Ho
ˆpitaux de Paris, and the Sunnybrook Dementia Study [SDS]).
Unless otherwise indicated, all analyses were planned and performed in March 2018. These
analyses were not planned prior to data collection. The analyses were performed following an
analysis of seasonal rhythms of gene expression and epigenetic modification in the ROS and
MAP cohorts, which has been reported elsewhere, and were partially driven by these earlier
results [8]. Moreover, we had previously analyzed the cognitive data in relation to sleep [9].
The analyses were otherwise conceived of prior to seeing data from the MARS, SDS, and CNC
cohorts. The analysis incorporating thyroid endocrine status (see below) was performed in
revision in June of 2018 at the request of a reviewer. We related measures of cognition and
clinical diagnoses of dementia to date of cognitive evaluation, CSF biomarkers of AD to date
of lumbar puncture, and postmortem neocortical RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data to date of
death relative to the calendar year.
Characteristics of the study participants are given in Table 1. The ROS, MAP, and MARS
studies are prospective observational cohort studies of the risk factors for common chronic
diseases of aging. They share nearly identical protocols. The ROS is a longitudinal study of
aging in Catholic brothers, nuns, and priests from across the US [10]. The MAP is a commu-
nity-based study of aging in the greater Chicago area that enrolls participants with diverse
backgrounds and socioeconomic status from continuous care retirement communities
throughout northwestern Illinois, as well as from individual homes across the Chicago metro-
politan area [10]. Both the ROS and MAP cohorts consist primarily of individuals of self-

 reported European descent (93%). The MARS is a community-based study of older adults of
self-reported African descent in the greater Chicago area [11]. Participants in all 3 studies are
free of known dementia at study enrollment. All participants in the ROS and MAP cohorts
and a subset of participants in the MARS cohort agree to brain donation upon death. For our
primary analyses, we included all ROS, MAP, and MARS participants with complete cognitive
testing (see below) and without cognitive impairment at the time of their first cognitive assess-
ment. Of the 4,004 ROS, MAP, and MARS participants enrolled between January 1994 and
May 2017, 3,924 completed the entire cognitive battery at their baseline assessment, 2,761 of
whom were without cognitive impairment. Cognitive, demographic, and clinical data from
these 2,761 participants were included in our primary analyses. In addition, structured autop-
sies were performed on 1,410 decedents, and RNA-Seq data from the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC) were obtained from 507 of these.
The SDS (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01800214) is an observational cohort study of consecu-
tively collected cases (1992–2014) from a tertiary care clinic in Toronto, Canada [12]. For this
study, we included participants clinically classified as having AD at their baseline assessment
(see criteria below), and in whom Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) scores were available. Of 1,143
participants enrolled between 1992 and 2014, 285 had a primary clinical diagnosis of AD, of
whom 271 had DRS scores at the time of baseline assessment. Clinical, demographic, and psy-
chometric data from these 271 participants were included in this study. The CNC cohort con-
sists of patients who attended a clinical and research memory clinic specializing in the care of
patients with cognitive disorders, the memory clinic at the Lariboisière Hospital, between July
2, 2008, and June 15, 2017, who had undergone CSF collection with measurement of amyloid
and tau, whose entire clinical work-up was performed at the Lariboisière Hospital, and for
whom a final clinical diagnosis was available. Of 2,298 patients assessed between July 2008 and
June 2017, the vast majority had had a portion of their clinical work-up completed at an out-
side institution and were excluded from these analyses. Of the remaining 424 participants with
a final clinical diagnosis, 321 also had a lumbar puncture with quantification of Aβ 40, Aβ 42,
tau, and phospho-tau. Psychometric, clinical, demographic, and CSF data from these 321 par-
ticipants were included in this study.
Statement of ethics approval
The ROS, MAP, and MARS were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush Univer-
sity Medical Center, the SDS was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Sunnybrook
Research Institute, and the CNC study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of
University of Paris Diderot. All studies were conducted in accordance with the latest version
of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants provided written informed consent. In
addition, all ROS and MAP participants, and some MARS participants, signed an Anatomical
Gift Act for organ donation.
Assessment of cognition and diagnosis of dementia
Participants in the ROS, MAP, and MARS cohorts underwent annual uniform structured cog-
nitive evaluations consisting of a battery of 19 cognitive tests spanning 5 domains (episodic
memory [logical memory Ia, logical memory IIa, immediate story recall, delayed story recall,
word list memory, word list recall, word list recognition], semantic memory [Boston naming
test, category fluency, national adult reading test], working memory [digit span forward, digit
span backward, digit ordering], perceptual speed [symbol digit modalities test, number com-
parison, Stroop word reading, Stroop color naming], and visuospatial ability [judgment of line
orientation, standard progressive matrices]). As described previously [13], a composite

 measure for each domain was created by converting each test within each domain to a z-score
and averaging the z-scores. The 5 domain composite measures were then averaged to create a
composite global cognitive score scaled such that 0 represents the mean score of all partici-
pants at baseline, positive scores indicate better performance, and 1 unit represents approxi-
mately 1 standard deviation of performance. Participants were classified as having a clinical
diagnosis of dementia by National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders
and Stroke–Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria [14]. Persons with
cognitive impairment by neuropsychological testing but without a clinical diagnosis of demen-
tia were classified as having MCI. Participants without dementia or MCI were classified as
having no cognitive impairment. Date of cognitive assessment was recorded at the time of cog-
nitive assessment.
Patients in the SDS cohort underwent a comprehensive battery of 17 tests as described pre-
viously [15]. Of these, data from the DRS [16], the California Verbal Learning Test [17], digit
span forward and backward [18], the Digit Symbol Substitution Test [19], the Wisconsin Card
Sorting Test [20], semantic fluency for animals [21,22], and the Benton Line Orientation Test
[23] were included in these analyses. AD diagnoses were made by consensus of 2 independent
clinicians according to prevailing clinical consensus criteria [24]. Date of cognitive assessment
was recorded at the time of cognitive assessment.
Patients in the CNC cohort underwent routine clinical, neurological, and neuropsychologi-
cal evaluations, and brain imaging as clinically indicated. On the basis of all available data,
including CSF biomarkers, and in accordance with National Institute on Aging (NIA)–Alzhei-
mer’s Association criteria [24], patients were classified into 2 groups: AD and non-AD.
Complex cases were discussed, and diagnoses were made by a multidisciplinary team of neu-
rologists, geriatricians, and neuropsychologists. Non-AD participants included participants
with cognitive disorders other than AD including frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dis-
ease, Parkinson disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and non-degenerative dementia (including
vascular dementia, alcohol-related dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus, infectious dis-
ease, and psychiatric disorders among others).
Assessment of clinical covariates
In the ROS, MAP, and MARS cohorts, we computed age at the time of cognitive assessment
from the self-reported date of birth and the date of assessment. We computed age at death
from the self-reported date of birth and the date of death. We recorded sex and self-reported
race at the time of the baseline interview. Depressive symptoms were assessed on the date of
cognitive evaluation with a 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depres-
sion (CES-D) scale [25]. Clock time of cognitive testing was recorded at the time of testing.
Times were binned into hours, and considered as a categorical variable. For sleep duration,
MAP and ROS participants were asked on the date of cognitive evaluation to report how many
hours they usually slept at night over the preceding month. For physical activity, MAP and
ROS participants were asked on the date of cognitive evaluation to report the number of hours
per week spent in 5 categories of activities: walking, gardening or yard work, calisthenics or
general exercise, bicycle riding, and swimming or water exercises [26]. In a subset of ROS,
MAP, and MARS participants, serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were assessed
by immunoassay by Quest Diagnostics (Madison, NJ, US).
In the SDS cohort, age, sex, and years of education were extracted from clinical records.
In the CNC cohort, age and sex were extracted from clinical records.

 Evaluation of CSF
In the CNC cohort, lumbar punctures were performed on fasting patients within 1 month fol-
lowing their clinical diagnosis, usually between 09:00 and 12:00. Within 4 hours of collection,
samples were centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 minutes at 4 ˚C, aliquoted into 0.5-ml polypropylene
tubes, and stored at −80 ˚C. Subsequently, CSF Aβ 40, Aβ 42, total tau, and phospho-tau were
measured using a commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(INNOTEST, Fujirebio Europe, Gent, Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Date of lumbar puncture was recorded at the time of lumbar puncture.
Neuropathological evaluation
Neuropathological evaluation was performed in decedents from the ROS, MAP, and MARS
cohorts. AD pathology was quantified as described previously [27,28]. Neurofibrillary tangles,
diffuse plaques, and neuritic plaques were visualized by Bielschowsky silver staining in sections
from the frontal, temporal, parietal, and entorhinal cortices and the hippocampus. For a cate-
gorical pathological diagnosis of AD, cases were classified as no AD, low likelihood AD, inter-
mediate likelihood AD, or high likelihood AD based on the NIA-Reagan criteria [29]; a
participant was considered to have a pathological diagnosis of AD if their NIA-Reagan classifi-
cation was “intermediate likelihood” or “high likelihood.” To generate a composite continuous
measure of the burden of AD pathology, neurofibrillary tangles, diffuse plaques, and neuritic
plaques were counted in the regions above, the raw counts were divided by the standard devia-
tion of the same index for that region across the entire cohort, and the scaled scores were aver-
aged as described previously [28]. In addition to the above, the percent area occupied by
amyloid beta was quantified as previously described [30]. Briefly, after immersion fixation in
paraformaldehyde, tissue blocks from 8 brain regions (mid-frontal cortex, premotor cortex,
inferior temporal cortex, angular gyrus, calcarine cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, entorhinal
cortex, and hippocampus CA1/subiculum) were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and incu-
bated with antibodies to amyloid beta (monoclonal mouse anti–amyloid beta clone 10D5; Elan
Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA, US) followed by development with diaminobenzidine
and nickel. The mean percent area occupied by amyloid beta–immunopositive material was
quantified in each of the 8 brain regions in each individual using a systematic random sam-
pling approach and a multistage computational image analysis protocol as previously
described [30]. These values were averaged across regions to generate a summary measure of
amyloid load for each individual.
To quantify Lewy body pathology, 6-μm paraffin-embedded sections from the cingulate,
entorhinal, midfrontal, middle temporal, and inferior parietal cortices and the substantia nigra
were immunostained with antibodies to alpha synuclein (pSyn-64, 1:20,000; Wako Chemicals
USA; Richmond, VA, US). The distribution of Lewy bodies was graded on a semi-quantitative
scale (0 = none, 1 = brainstem or limbic predominant, 2 = neocortical) according to a modified
version of published criteria [31].
Macroscopic cerebral infarcts were identified by visual inspection of 1-cm coronal slabs
and confirmed by histological review as previously described [32]. Microscopic infarcts were
quantified in a minimum of 9 regions (6 cortical and 3 subcortical) as previously described
[33].
Evaluation of DLPFC transcript expression
RNA-Seq was performed on blocks of DLPFC from a subset of ROS and MAP participants as
previously described [8]. RNA was extracted from DLPFC blocks and quantified by Nanodrop
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, US). An Agilent Bioanalyzer was used to assess

integrity (RIN) score of 5 or less were excluded from further analysis. The strand-specific
dUTP method [34] with poly-A selection [35] was used by the Broad Institute Genomics Plat-
form to prepare the RNA-Seq library. Poly-A selection was followed by first-strand-specific
cDNA synthesis, with dUTP used for second-strand-specific cDNA synthesis, followed by
fragmentation and Illumina adapter ligation for library construction. An Illumina HiSeq
machine was used to perform sequencing with 101-bp paired-end reads, achieving a coverage
of 150M reads for the first 12 samples, which served as a deep coverage reference. The remain-
ing samples were sequenced with coverage of 50M reads. Next, beginning and ending low-
quality bases and adapter sequences were trimmed from the reads, and ribosomal RNA reads
were removed. The Bowtie 1 software package [36] was used to align the trimmed reads to the
reference genome. Finally, the RSEM software package was used to estimate, in units of frag-
ments per kilobase per million mapped fragments (FPKM), expression levels for 55,889 indi-
vidual GENCODE v14 genes, which were then quantile-normalized, correcting for batch effect
with Combat [37]. These data are available through the Synapse AMP-AD Knowledge Portal
(Synapse ID syn3388564; 10.7303/syn3388564).
We used a consensus clustering method called SpeakEasy [38,39] to robustly define co-
expressed molecular systems based on the gene–gene correlation matrix. Briefly, this method
clusters the data hundreds of times under slightly different conditions, and selects the most
representative clustering. SpeakEasy is relatively insensitive to parameter selection, is able to
utilize negative correlations in the clustering process, minimizes unclassified “gray module”
nodes, and shows good performance on synthetic clustering benchmarks including the Lanci-
chinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmarks [38]. Applying this approach to our RNA-Seq data
generated 257 modules, of which 47 ranged in size from 20 to 556 genes. In all, 98% of all
genes were assigned to one of these 47 modules. This approach yielded very similar results to
standard WGCNA algorithms [40] when applied to our data [39].
For each gene in each module, we computed the normalized expression level by subtracting
the mean expression level for that gene across all individuals, and dividing by the standard
deviation. Then, we summarized the expression level of each module in each individual by
computing the mean of the normalized expression levels of all genes in that module.
Data from 507 samples meeting quality control criteria as above, and with full clinical data,
were included in this analysis (Table 1).
Statistical analysis
A summary of the statistical analyses is provided here. For a full description see S1 Methods.
For all analyses, only observations with complete data for each analysis were used.
The main outcomes of interest were cognitive performance considered as a continuous
variable, combined clinical diagnosis of MCI or dementia considered as a categorical variable,
levels of CSF AD biomarkers (including Aβ 42, Aβ 40, tau, and phospho-tau) considered as
continuous variables, and DLPFC expression of GENCODE v14 genes, considered as continu-
ous variables. The main predictor of interest was date relative to the calendar year (of cognitive
assessment for the cognitive outcomes, of lumbar puncture for CSF markers, and of death for
postmortem RNA-Seq) considered as an angular continuous variable. Potential confounders
included age (at time of cognitive evaluation, lumbar puncture, or death) considered as a con-
tinuous variable, sex considered as a dichotomous variable, years of education considered as a
continuous variable, number of depressive symptoms considered as a continuous variable,
hours of sleep considered as a continuous variable, hours of physical activity considered as a
continuous variable, serum TSH level as a continuous variable, and clock time of assessment

 or death considered as a categorical variable in 1-hour bins. Potential effect modifiers included
age (continuous), sex (dichotomous), and race (categorical).
In the ROS, MAP, and MARS cohorts, we characterized seasonal patterns in cognition by
considering cognition as a linear function of the cosine of the date of evaluation, adjusted
for age at evaluation, sex, and level of education (S1 Fig). We determined the significance of
rhythmicity by comparing this model fit to one without the cosine term using an F-test. We
extracted the amplitude, and the timing of the acrophase (peak) and nadir (trough) of the
cosine curve (S1 Fig). We calculated standardized amplitudes by dividing the amplitude by the
standard deviation of cognitive function across the cohort at baseline. Moreover, we contextu-
alized the magnitude of this amplitude by comparing it to the magnitude of the effect estimate
for age from Equation 1 in S1 Methods.
Using this approach, in our primary analyses, we assessed seasonal rhythmicity in compos-
ite global cognitive function at the baseline evaluation in the ROS and MAP cohorts, control-
ling for age, sex, and level of education, and including only those participants without MCI or
dementia. We then did the same for the MARS cohort. Then, we analyzed the ROS, MAP, and
MARS cohorts together, controlling for the effect of study cohort as a fixed effect. Although
multiple annual cycles of cognitive data are available in some ROS, MAP, and MARS partici-
pants, the design of these studies is such that participants are assessed at roughly the same date
across cycles (interquartile range −13 to +11 days). Because of the high intra-participant corre-
lation of assessment dates, adding data from multiple cycles per participant would not substan-
tially improve our estimates of seasonal effects nor would it allow for effective estimation of
intra-participant seasonal effects. Therefore, in the interests of analytical parsimony, we did
not include multiple cycles of data in our primary analyses.
Cognition may be affected by a number of potential confounders that may also show sea-
sonal variation, including time of cognitive testing, depression, hours of sleep, and physical
activity. To account for these, we considered models adjusted for time of cognitive testing
(considered as a categorical variable by hour and available in the ROS, MAP, and MARS
cohorts), number of depressive symptoms (considered as a continuous variable and available
in the ROS, MAP, and MARS cohorts), hours of sleep (considered as a continuous variable
and available in the ROS and MAP cohorts only), and hours spent engaged in physical activi-
ties (considered as a continuous variable and available in the ROS and MAP cohorts only).
Moreover, in June 2018, we considered an additional model adjusted for serum level of TSH.
Assessment of TSH was added to the ROS and MAP assessment protocols only after 2002, and
so data on serum TSH levels were not available for nearly 50% of ROS and MAP participants
at their baseline assessment. In contrast, data on serum TSH levels were available for 97% of
MARS participants at their baseline assessment. Therefore, the analysis of TSH was restricted
to the MARS cohort.
Next we examined whether seasonal rhythms in cognition may vary by specific cognitive
domain. To do so, in the combined ROS, MAP, and MARS cohorts, we repeated our primary
analyses, considering separately summary scores in the specific domains of working memory,
perceptual speed, visuospatial ability, semantic memory, and episodic memory.
Seasonal variation in cognition may plausibly lead to seasonal variation in the diagnosis of
MCI or dementia. To assess this, we followed the ROS, MAP, and MARS participants from
our primary analyses above, and considered their clinical diagnosis at the last available cogni-
tive evaluation. In June of 2018, we repeated our primary analysis, considering the last avail-
able in lieu of the baseline cognitive evaluation. Then, we considered the odds of being
classified as having MCI or dementia as a function of the cosine of the date of assessment,
adjusted for age, sex, education, and source cohort. To quantify the contribution of seasonal

 rhythmicity to the odds of being classified as having MCI or dementia, we compared this
model to a reduced equation without the cosine term using a likelihood ratio test.
We also considered season as a categorical variable, defining winter/spring as January–June
and summer/fall as July–December, and considered the effect of categorical season on the
odds of being diagnosed with MCI/dementia, comparing this model to a reduced equation
without the seasonal term with a likelihood ratio test. In June of 2018, we also considered mod-
els adjusted for time of cognitive testing, number of depressive symptoms, hours of sleep,
hours of physical activity, and serum level of TSH.
Next, we examined whether AD pathology is associated with differential seasonal rhythmic-
ity of cognition. To do so, we repeated our primary analyses above using the last known cogni-
tive assessments from deceased ROS, MAP, and MARS participants with and without AD
pathology, defined as an NIA-Reagan classification of intermediate or high, at death. We con-
sidered an augmented model, allowing for independent effects of AD pathology on the level
and rhythmicity of cognition.
Next, we repeated our primary analyses in the SDS cohort with the total DRS score as the
primary outcome, and then with the DRS subscores, as well as scores on the digit span test,
Digit Symbol Substitution Test, California Verbal Learning Test, semantic fluency (animal
naming) test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and Benton Line Orientation Test as secondary
outcomes, all considered as continuous variables.
Pathophysiological processes underlying AD, including amyloid and tau metabolism, are
important contributors to impaired cognition in older adults. To examine for evidence of sea-
sonal rhythmicity in amyloid and tau biology, we examined CSF Aβ 40, Aβ 42, tau, and phos-
pho-tau in the CNC cohort as a function of date of lumbar puncture, adjusted for age and sex,
using an identical approach as used for cognition above, considering first all participants
together, adjusted for diagnosis (AD versus non-AD), and then allowing for differences in
level and rhythmicity between participants with and without AD.
Next, we set out to identify co-expressed molecular systems that may be related to seasonal
rhythms in cognition. We considered a set of co-expressed genes (module) to be potentially
related to seasonal rhythms in cognition if it fulfilled all of the following: (1) expression was
seasonally rhythmic, (2) expression was either in phase or antiphase to the rhythm of cogni-
tion, and (3) expression was associated with cognitive performance proximate to death. To
assess seasonal rhythmicity, we considered the mean expression level of each gene module as a
function of date and time of death, adjusted for age at death, sex, level of education, and meth-
odological covariates such as batch, postmortem interval, and RNA quality (RIN score), and
accounting for multiple comparisons by permutation, as described previously [8]. A module
was considered seasonally rhythmic if its p-value, adjusted for multiple comparisons, was
<0.05. To assess association with cognition proximate to death, we considered the composite
global cognition proximate to death as a linear function of mean module expression, adjusted
for age, sex, education, and methodological covariates including postmortem interval, batch,
and RNA quality (RIN score), while accounting for multiple comparisons by generation of
10,000 null datasets created by permuting module labels. A module was considered associated
with cognition if its p-value, adjusted for multiple comparisons, was <0.05. In June of 2018,
we utilized the same approach to relate module expression to burden of amyloid pathology in
autopsy. In June of 2018, we also characterized cognitive rhythms proximate to death by
repeating our primary analyses on the subset of ROS and MAP participants with RNA-Seq
data available, using the last available cognitive assessment proximate to death, and consider-
ing composite global cognitive function, as well as the 5 cognitive domains.
For co-expression modules meeting the above criteria, we controlled for potential con-
founders including depression and neuropathologies potentially affecting cognition—

 including the burden of AD pathology considered as a continuous measure, the presence or
absence of cortical Lewy bodies considered as a dichotomous variable, and the number of mac-
roscopic and microscopic cortical infarcts considered as continuous measures—by repeating
the above analysis in models adjusted for these covariates. We also examined the association of
AD pathology with the level and rhythmicity of module expression by considering augmented
models similar to the analysis we performed with cognition in Equations 10, 11, and 12 in S1
Methods.
We next examined associations between module expression and other cognition-related
phenotypes including the individual cognitive domains, Mini-Mental State Examination
scores, and measures of AD pathology by calculating Spearman correlations between mean
module expression at death and either cognitive phenotypes at the last measurement proxi-
mate to death or neuropathological phenotypes at death, adjusting for multiple comparisons
by Bonferroni correction.
Finally, we examined transcription factor binding sites associated with the 4 co-expression
modules putatively associated with seasonal rhythms of cognition. To do so, we used genome-
wide annotated binding sites for 161 transcription factors from the ENCODE project [41–43].
We considered a transcript to be locally associated with a transcription factor if its transcrip-
tion start site overlapped with one of the ENCODE-annotated transcription factor binding
sites or was within 2,000 bp of it. For each of the 4 co-expression modules, we then used logis-
tic regression models to examine the independent association of the local presence of binding
sites for each of the 161 ENCODE transcription factors with the odds of a transcript being a
member of a given co-expression module. We corrected for multiple comparisons using Bon-
ferroni correction for 161 transcription factors (α = 0.05/161 = 0.0003).
Results
Study participants
Characteristics of the study participants are given in Table 1.
Association between season and cognition in older adults without cognitive
impairment
We first examined the association between season and baseline cognition in participants in the
ROS and MAP without cognitive impairment (Table 1; n = 2,234). The ROS and MAP are lon-
gitudinal cohort studies of aging in which participants are free of dementia at study enrollment
and agree to brain donation upon death. The mean (SD) baseline composite global cognitive
score among participants without cognitive impairment in the combined ROS and MAP
cohort was 0.26 (0.44) units. In an unadjusted model, season had a significant association with
composite global cognitive function, with the highest average composite global cognition seen
just before the fall equinox (p = 0.004). Compared to participants assessed at the winter/spring
trough, the composite global cognitive score of participants assessed at the summer/fall peak
was 0.20 standard deviations (a measure of the magnitude of seasonal variation relative to
overall variability) higher (95% CI 0.09 to 0.32, p = 0.004). In a model adjusted for age, sex,
and education, the effect of season on composite global cognition was similar, with a peak
before the fall equinox (Fig 1A). Compared to participants assessed in the winter and spring,
the composite global cognitive score of participants assessed in the summer and fall was 0.13
SD higher (95% CI 0.04 to 0.24, p = 0.039)—equivalent to that of participants 4.4 years younger
(95% CI 1.8 to 8.6, p = 0.018). In the African-American MARS cohort (Table 1; n = 527), the
mean (standard deviation) composite global cognitive score was 0.19 (0.47). In the MARS

 cohort, in a model adjusted for age, sex, and education, the magnitude of the seasonal effect
was similar to that in the ROS and MAP cohorts, with 0.21 SD of composite global cognition
(95% CI 0.06 to 0.47, p = 0.109) separating participants evaluated at the winter/spring nadir
and summer/fall acrophase, equivalent to an age difference of 4.3 years (95% CI 1.29 to 9.26,
p = 0.064). The p-value in the MARS cohort was somewhat attenuated, although this may
reflect the smaller number of MARS participants (n = 527) compared to ROS/MAP partici-
pants (n = 2,234) in these analyses. Pooling data across all 3 cohorts (Table 1) enhanced the
effect (Fig 1C; amplitude = 0.14 SD [95% CI 0.07 to 0.23], p = 0.007, with the peak to trough
difference equivalent in effect to a 4.8-year difference in age [95% CI 2.1 to 8.5], p = 0.009).
The association between season and cognition did not vary by age, sex, race, or source cohort
(p > 0.05 for interaction terms). Moreover, inclusion of terms for time of cognitive test,
depression, sleep, physical activity, or serum level of TSH did not substantially change esti-
mates of these seasonal effects compared to models without these terms (S1 Table). The timing
of rhythms of cognitive performance was similar across cognitive subdomains (S2 Fig), with
peak performance near the fall equinox. However, the seasonal effect was strongest for work-
ing memory and perceptual speed and weaker for the other domains.
Association between season and clinical diagnosis
We hypothesized that the association of season with cognition would be reflected in rates of
cognitive diagnoses. To test this, we analyzed the last available assessment for ROS, MAP, and
MARS participants (Table 1; a median [IQR] of 6 [3 to 11] years since study enrollment). In a
model adjusted for age, sex, and education, there persisted significant seasonal rhythmicity of
composite global cognitive performance at the last available wave of data (amplitude = 0.13 SD
[95% CI 0.05 to 0.24], p = 0.022). Results were similar when we restricted these analyses to
deceased participants in whom RNA-Seq data were available (S3 Fig). We then used logistic
regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, and source cohort to model the association
between assessment date and the odds of meeting criteria for MCI or dementia. Of the 2,761
participants, 813 (29.5%) met diagnostic criteria for MCI or AD. In unadjusted models, the
effect of season on diagnosis was significant (deviance = −10.3, p = 0.006). A participant evalu-
ated in the winter or spring (January–June) had a roughly 24% higher odds of meeting criteria
for MCI or dementia than one evaluated in the summer or fall (July–December; odds ratio
1.24 [95% CI 1.05–1.47], p = 0.008). In models adjusted for age, sex, and education, the effects
were similar (Fig 2A; deviance = −10.2, p = 0.006). In these adjusted models, a participant eval-
uated in the winter or spring (January–June) had a higher odds of meeting criteria for MCI or
dementia than one evaluated in the summer or fall (July–December; odds ratio 1.31 [95% CI
1.10–1.57], p = 0.003). This effect remained similarly significant in models adjusted for time of
test, number of depressive symptoms, self-reported hours of sleep, self-reported hours of phys-
ical activity, or serum level of TSH (S2 Table).
Association between season and cognition in adults with AD
AD affects circadian rhythmicity and may plausibly affect seasonal rhythmicity. To examine
the association between pathologically confirmed AD and seasonal cognitive rhythms, we ana-
lyzed the last available assessment in ROS, MAP, and MARS decedents (Table 1; n = 1,410).
The median (IQR) time between last cognitive assessment and death was 282 days (152–434).

 Considering all participants, there remained a significant association between season and com-
posite global cognition (Fig 2B; amplitude = 0.23 SD [95% CI 0.11 to 0.38], p = 0.026). Partici-
pants with pathological AD had lower mean composite global cognition than those without
(estimate = −0.65 SD, SE = 0.05, p < 0.0001); however, the seasonal rhythmicity of cognition
did not differ significantly between these groups (p = 0.81), suggesting preserved seasonality of
cognition in pathological AD.
To assess generalizability, we replicated our analyses in baseline data from the Canadian
SDS cohort, an observational study of cases from a tertiary care memory clinic in Toronto,
Canada. The mean (SD) Mattis DRS score of participants with AD was 115 (17). In a model
adjusted for age, sex, and years of education, the association between season and the total DRS
score was significant (amplitude 0.50 SD [95% CI 0.07 to 0.66], p = 0.017; Fig 2C). The highest
model-predicted DRS scores were seen in the fall (November 16), with an average difference
of 8 points between participants evaluated at the spring nadir (May 18) and fall peak. There
were strong effects on the DRS subdomains of attention, speed, and initiation, and weaker
effects on other domains (S4 and S5 Figs).
Seasonal rhythms of CSF AD biomarkers
Amyloid and tau pathology contribute to cognitive impairment in older adults [44], and CSF
amyloid levels are diurnally rhythmic [45]. To test for an association between season and amy-
loid and tau biology, we analyzed CSF amyloid and tau levels in patients with (n = 176) and
without (n = 145) clinical AD from the CNC cohort, an observational cohort study of patients
from a tertiary care memory center in Paris, France (Table 1; n = 321). The mean (SD) CSF Aβ
42, Aβ 40, tau, and phospho-tau levels were 754 (280), 11,835 (4,856), 469 (318), and 71 (40)
pg/ml, respectively. Considering all participants together, in a model adjusted for age and sex,
CSF Aβ 42 level was strongly rhythmic, peaking in late June (amplitude 0.30 SD [95% CI 0.10
to 0.64], p = 0.003; Fig 3A). In the models adjusted for age and sex, season was not significantly
associated with Aβ 40 (p = 0.06; Fig 3C). Tau and phospho-tau were not rhythmic (p = 0.515
for tau; p = 0.67 for phospho-tau; Fig 3E and 3G). Patients with AD had lower CSF Aβ 42 and
higher Aβ 40, tau, and phospho-tau, as expected (Fig 3B, 3D, 3F and 3H). Moreover, the rhyth-
micity of Aβ 42 was attenuated in participants with AD (Fig 3B).
Association between season and neocortical gene expression
Seasonal rhythms of gene expression correlate with tissue function in other organ systems
such as the immune system [46]. To identify genes linking season to cognition, we used RNA-
Seq to quantify gene expression in postmortem DLPFC samples from 507 ROS and MAP par-
ticipants, as previously reported [8]. The DLPFC is a key node for working memory, the cogni-
tive domain most strongly affected by season in our data. We analyzed groups of co-expressed
genes called “modules,” which are detected as clusters of correlated genes. These modules are
rhythmicity to the log-odds of being classified as having MCI or dementia. (B) Composite global cognitive

 driven by cellular or regulatory mechanisms controlling a wide range of functions [47] and are
more robust markers of biological functions than individual genes. We considered a module
as potentially linking season to cognition if its expression was (1) itself seasonally rhythmic,
(2) in phase or antiphase with cognition, and (3) associated with cognition proximate to death.
Of 47 modules examined, in models adjusted for age, sex, education, time of death, postmor-
tem interval, and methodological variables such as batch, postmortem interval, and RNA qual-
ity (RIN score), 4 modules (labeled arbitrarily m6: n = 328 genes, amplitude = 0.44 SD [95% CI
0.21 to 0.65], p = 0.0021; m13: n = 353 genes, amplitude = 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.27 to 0.76], p =
0.0009; m109: n = 390 genes, amplitude = 0.43 SD [95% CI 0.24 to 0.67], p = 0.0021; and m122:
n = 370 genes, amplitude 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.20 to 0.71], p = 0.0012) met all 3 criteria (S3
Table).
The genes in these modules are in S4 Table. Two modules, m13 and m122, showed peak
expression at the time of peak cognition (Fig 4A–4D and 4I–4L). Higher expression of these
modules was associated with better cognition proximate to death, and with a lower burden of
amyloid pathology at autopsy. The other 2 modules, m6 and m109, showed peak expression at
the time of poorest cognition (Fig 4E–4H and 4M–4P). Higher expression of these modules
was associated with worse cognition proximate to death, and with a higher burden of amyloid
pathology at autopsy. These modules remained associated with season and cognition in mod-
els adjusted for depression and other neuropathologies (S5 Table). They were also associated
with other cognitive and neuropathological phenotypes (Fig 5). Module rhythmicity was simi-
lar in those with and without AD pathology (p > 0.05 for all 4 modules).
Finally, we used genome-wide annotated binding sites for 161 transcription factors from
the ENCODE project [41] to identify sites associated with each module. After correction for
multiple comparisons by permutation, 15, 13, 6, and 9 transcription factor binding sites were
associated with membership in modules m6, m13, m109, and m122, respectively (S6 Table).
Of these, 5 (BCL11A, EGR1, MEF2C, and THAP1 associated with m109, and CTCF associated
with m13) were themselves previously identified as seasonally rhythmic [8].
Discussion
In this study of 3,353 older adults across multiple countries, cohorts, and races, there was a sig-
nificant and reproducible association between season and cognition, with peak cognition near
the fall equinox and a seasonal effect equivalent to a roughly 4-year difference in age. This asso-
ciation was independent of mood, sleep, physical activity, and thyroid status; it was clinically
significant, as reflected in a nearly 30% higher odds of meeting criteria for MCI or dementia in
winter and spring compared to summer and fall; and it persisted in cases with pathologically
confirmed AD. Moreover, season was also associated with CSF Aβ levels and the brain expres-
sion of cognition-associated gene modules that were associated with identifiable transcription
factor binding sites. Additional dementia care resources may be needed in the winter and
spring, when cognition is likely to be worse. Moreover, these findings suggest substantial sea-
sonal plasticity of cognition, amyloid biology, and cognition-related transcriptional programs,
even in the presence of pathological AD. Seasonal factors may thus be important modifiers of
the association of cognition with AD pathology, an effect potentially mediated by BCL11A,
EGR1, THAP1, CTCF, MEF2C, and other key transcription factors, some of which are them-
selves seasonally rhythmic. Further work to understand the mechanisms underlying this plas-

 improve cognition in AD by enhancing the normal summer and fall peak in cognition, and/or
extending it into other seasons.
Several previous studies found no association of season with cognition [3,6,7], while others
showed association between season and some domains but not others [4,48], or only in indi-
viduals with psychopathology [5]. In contrast, we demonstrated a robust association of season
with cognition in older adults with and without AD in multiple cohorts. Several factors may
account for this divergence from previous studies. First, several previous studies examined
cognition only near the solstices [4,6] or correlated cognition to day length [7]. If, as our data
suggest, cognition peaks near the fall equinox, these approaches would fail to uncover signifi-
cant seasonality. Second, several studies did not examine working memory [6,7], which in our
data was the cognitive domain most affected by season. Third, it is possible that in younger
adults, who were the subject of most previous studies, an abundance of cognitive reserve mini-
mized the association between season and cognition, whereas this phenomenon becomes
more important as cognitive reserve diminishes with cognitive aging. One study that found no
association between season and cognition in young adults nevertheless found an association
between season and cortical fMRI responses during a working memory task [3], with peak
responses occurring near the fall equinox, roughly coincident with the peak in working mem-
ory observed in our study. This supports the hypothesis of a subclinical association between
season and cognition in younger adults, seen on fMRI but not cognitive testing.
The persistence of a robust summer/fall peak in cognition suggests that even in patholog-
ically confirmed AD, there remains substantial cognitive plasticity. Identifying drivers or
mediators of this effect may enable leveraging this plasticity to improve cognition year-round.
There are several hypotheses regarding potential mediators and drivers. First, the summer and

 fall peak in cognition may be driven by environmental factors such as light and temperature. If
true, then interventions such as phototherapy or temperature modification may be effective in
sustaining this peak year-round. Second, behavioral factors such as activity [49], sleep [50],
and diet [51] show seasonality and may drive the summer and fall peak in cognition. In this
study, the association between season and cognition was independent of self-reported sleep
and physical activity, although studies incorporating objective markers of these and other
behaviors may reveal a more important role for behavioral factors. Third, seasonal rhythms in
psychological state (e.g., depression) may drive the association between season and cognition.
In this study, the seasonality of cognition was independent of depression; however, other psy-
chological factors, such as negative affect, which has been associated with MCI and dementia
[52], may be important. While data on positive and negative affect were collected on some of
our participants, they were available on too few participants to test their association with sea-
sonal rhythms of cognition in this study. Fourth, seasonal rhythms in physiological state may
potentially drive the association between season and cognition. In our study, adjusting for
serum levels of TSH did not substantially attenuate estimates of the association between season
and cognition. However, additional metabolic factors that may potentially link season to cog-
nition are vitamin D [53], sex hormones like testosterone [54], and melatonin [55]. Unfortu-
nately, data on serum levels of vitamin D, testosterone, and melatonin were not available in
our study. Finally, an endogenous seasonal clock may drive rhythms in cognition. Supporting
this, there is some evidence for such a clock in other species [56], and seasonal rhythms in
fMRI responses to cognitive tasks persist even with control of behavioral and environmental
factors [3]. Studies combining serial measurements of cognition, environment, behavior, and
physiology in the same individuals at multiple time points across the year will help to distin-
guish these possibilities.
In the CNC cohort, CSF Aβ 42 level was highest in the summer, slightly preceding the time
of peak cognition and lowest risk for MCI/dementia in the ROS, MAP, and MARS cohorts.
This peak was unrelated to the clock time of lumbar puncture as all lumbar punctures were
performed within a narrow 2- to 3-hour window each day. The phase difference between the
CSF Aβ rhythms in the CNC cohort and the cognitive and molecular rhythms in the other
cohorts may relate in part to differences in latitude (CNC 49˚ N versus south of 44˚ N for the
other cohorts). The overlap between the timing of greatest CSF Aβ 42 levels and lowest odds of
MCI/dementia is in keeping with existing literature showing that high CSF Aβ 42 levels are
associated with better cognition even in older adults without a clinical diagnosis of AD [57].
Other studies have identified diurnal rhythms of CSF amyloid [45], but, to our knowledge, sea-
sonal rhythms have not been described. These rhythms may reflect seasonal variation in Aβ 42
synthesis, or in transitions between compartments (parenchyma, interstitium, CSF, and sys-
temic circulation) or forms (monomeric, oligomeric, and insoluble) of amyloid. CSF mono-
meric Aβ 42 concentrations are inversely related to brain interstitial oligomeric [58] and
fibrillar [59] Aβ in some contexts. Therefore, low winter CSF monomeric Aβ 42 levels may
reflect high levels of brain interstitial oligomeric Aβ species, which may have an adverse impact
on cognition [60]. Studies examining the association between season and oligomeric Aβ spe-
cies may shed light on this.
Irrespective of the ultimate drivers of the summer/fall peak in cognition, efforts to under-
stand its neurobiological substrates may identify molecular pathways whose plasticity is pre-
served in pathological AD and which may therefore be promising targets to enhance cognitive
function in AD. In this study, the summer/fall peak in cognition paralleled the seasonal nadirs
of 2 prefrontal cortex co-expression gene modules (m6 and m109) negatively associated with
cognition, and the seasonal acrophases of 2 gene modules (m13 and m122) positively associ-
ated with cognition. These phase relationships mean that the seasonal effects of these modules

 may be synergistic; peak cognition in the summer and fall may be driven by a synergy of higher
expression of modules positively associated with cognition and negatively associated with Aβ
(m13 and m122) and lower expression of modules negatively associated with cognition and
positively associated with Aβ (m6 and m109), while in the winter and spring the opposite
occurs. Gene ontology and cell type enrichment analyses for these modules have previously
been published [39]. Although 3 of the 4 modules (m6, m13, and m122) are not strongly
enriched for specific gene ontology pathways or cell types, m109 is relatively enriched for path-
ways involved in chromatin modification and cell cycle control, and is associated with cogni-
tive decline and amyloid pathology [39]. In experiments in human cell lines, knock-down of
selected m109 genes, including INPPL1 and PLXNB1, results in reduced extracellular amyloid
levels, potentially linking seasonal rhythms of m109 to seasonal rhythms of brain extracellular
amyloid [39]. Thus, one possible scenario is that in the summer and early fall, neocortical
expression of m109 and associated genes such as INPPL1 and PLXNB1 is at its lowest, leading
to relatively lower levels of brain interstitial oligomeric Aβ species (reflected by relatively high
CSF monomeric Aβ levels), which leads to improved cognition, while in the winter and early
spring the opposite is true (S6 Fig). Additional work is needed to examine the cognitive impact
of increasing or decreasing expression of these modules in model systems, and to understand
the mechanisms, such as the transcription factors identified in this study, that account for
their rhythmicity. This may enable therapeutically increasing the expression of m13 and m122,
or therapeutically decreasing the expression of m109 and m6 to enhance cognition year-round
in individuals with AD.
Some limitations should be noted. First, each participant or sample contributed only 1 data
point per annual cycle. It would be preferable to derive individual-level estimates of rhythmic-
ity by repeated testing or sampling from the same individual throughout the year. However, to
limit participant burden, we limited evaluations to once per year and CSF sampling to once
per participant. Moreover, it would not be ethically permissible to repeatedly sample neocorti-
cal tissue from living participants. Second, we relied on self-report to measure environmental
and behavioral factors leading up to each evaluation, and had limited quantitative data, making
it difficult to distinguish the influence of these factors. Of particular note, as all of the study
cohorts were based in relatively northern latitudes (north of 41˚ N), it is possible that extremes
of weather, particularly cold, may have resulted in participants with greater degrees of neuro-
logical disability (e.g., those with greater cognitive impairment) being less likely to be able to
attend study visits in the winter. However, this would have biased the study toward finding a
lower likelihood of meeting diagnostic criteria for MCI or dementia in the coldest months,
which is the opposite of the effect that was seen. Third, we had limited information on cause of
death in decedents, which may influence gene expression at time of death, and which may be
seasonal. Fourth, although this was one of the largest studies to date to examine seasonal
rhythms of human brain gene expression, it nevertheless lacked statistical power to draw firm
conclusions at the individual gene level, hence our analysis of gene sets defined by co-expres-
sion patterns. Fifth, this study consisted primarily of individuals of self-described European or
African descent living in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, limiting generalizabil-
ity to other races or geographic locations. It would be of particular interest to study popula-
tions in temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, where one might expect seasonal
effects to be in antiphase to those in the northern hemisphere, and to study populations in
equatorial regions, where one might expect seasonal effects to be relatively attenuated com-
pared to temperate regions. Finally, all cognitive and CSF assessments were performed during
a relatively limited window within the 24-hour day—during daylight hours. While this limited
the potential for confounding by time of assessment, it also limited the capacity to obtain
robust estimates of circadian effects, which would require sampling around the 24-hour clock.

 This study also had several strengths. Notwithstanding the population and geographic limi-
tations noted above, we replicated our primary analyses in cohorts from 3 different countries,
and 2 different racial groups, enhancing generalizability. Second, the temporal convergence of
cognitive and molecular data enhanced biological plausibility and allowed us to draw links
between molecular and behavioral rhythms. Third, cognitive assessments, lumbar punctures,
and dates of death were spread throughout the year, rather than limited to discrete sampling
times, maximizing the capacity to detect rhythmicity irrespective of phase. Fourth, we had his-
topathological confirmation in decedents, providing a high degree of diagnostic certainty.
Overall, we report robust estimates of an important source of variation in cognitive perfor-
mance and its biological correlates among a diverse set of older individuals. Season should be
considered as an important confounder when analyzing data from therapeutic trials and
observational studies in AD. In particular, studies aiming to estimate rates of cognitive decline
with repeated measurements of the same participant should either assess the same individual
at the same date in different study cycles (as is done in the ROS, MAP, and MARS cohorts) or
should consider season as a covariate. In clinical practice, seasonal effects may be an important
source of diagnostic misclassification and may account for the observation that some individu-
als with MCI revert to normal cognition on subsequent testing. Our findings should also
inform the design of clinical algorithms that leverage the winter/spring cognitive nadir to
enhance sensitivity in identifying participants at the earliest stages of disease. Finally, the effect
sizes seen in this study suggest that targeting the environmental or behavioral drivers of sea-
sonal cognitive plasticity, or the key transcription factors and genes identified in this study as
potentially mediating these effects, may allow us to substantially improve cognition in adults
with and without AD pathology.
