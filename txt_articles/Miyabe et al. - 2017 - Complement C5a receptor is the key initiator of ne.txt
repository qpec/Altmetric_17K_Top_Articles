Abstract
The deposition of immune complexes (IC) in tissues induces a “type III hypersensitivity” that 
results in tissue damage and underlies the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. The 
neutrophil is the first immune cell recruited into sites of IC deposition and plays a critical role in 
shaping the overall tissue response. However, the mechanism by which IC initiate and propagate 
neutrophil infiltration into tissue is not known. Here, using intravital multiphoton joint imaging of 
IC-induced arthritis in live mice, we found that the complement C5a receptor (C5aR) was the key 
initiator of neutrophil adhesion on joint endothelium. C5a presented on joint endothelium induced 
β2 integrin-dependent neutrophil arrest, facilitating neutrophil spreading and transition to 
crawling, and subsequent leukotriene B4 receptor (BLT1)-mediated extravasation of the first 
neutrophils. The chemokine receptor CCR1 promoted neutrophil crawling on the joint 
endothelium while CXCR2 amplified late neutrophil recruitment and survival once in the joint. 
Thus, imaging arthritis has defined a new paradigm for type III hypersensitivity where C5a 
directly initiates neutrophil adhesion on the joint endothelium igniting inflammation.

 erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), vasculitis, serum sickness, post-
streptococcal glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemia. In these diseases, collectively 
referred to as “type III hypersensitivity”, IC-deposition leads to a local inflammatory 
response characterized by immune cell infiltration and activation. The neutrophil is the first 
immune cell recruited into tissue, however, the mechanism by which deposited ICs initiate 
and propagate neutrophil infiltration into tissue is not known and is of considerable 
therapeutic importance (1).
The prevailing paradigm of “type III hypersensitivity” is that tissue-resident cells sense ICs 
through FcγRs and complement receptors and elaborate secondary mediators, such as TNF 
and IL-1, which activate endothelial cells (ECs) (1). Adhesion molecules and chemokines 
upregulated on the surface of activated ECs are then thought to promote neutrophil 
recruitment. While complement and FcγR activation have been variably implicated in the 
pathogenesis of IC-induced inflammation, their role in directly regulating neutrophil 
recruitment has not been elucidated.
The pathogenesis of IC-mediated disease has been interrogated in a variety of mouse 
models, including models of IC-induced inflammation of the skin, cremaster muscle, kidney, 
peritoneum, lung and joint (2–14). In the reverse passive cutaneous Arthus reaction, the 
inflammatory response in the skin is dependent on mast cell FcγR activation but 
independent of complement activation (2–4). In contrast, neutrophil FcγR activation is 
required for inflammation in models of IC-induced cremaster muscle and joint inflammation 
(5, 6), while tissue-resident macrophage FcγR activation is required in kidney, peritoneal 
and lung IC models (7–10). Inflammation in the cremaster muscle and kidney IC model are 
similar to the skin model in that they are independent of complement C3 and C5a (5, 8) 
while the peritoneal model is partially dependent on C5a (11, 12). C5a indirectly contributes 
to IC-mediated lung and peritoneal inflammation by activated FcγRs on resident 
macrophages (9, 10). In the K/BxN model of IC-induced arthritis, C5a is required for the 
development of arthritis (6, 14), although the mechanism by which it contributes to 
neutrophil recruitment and joint inflammation is not clear. Thus, there are important 
differences in the critical inducers of IC-induced inflammation depending on the organ 
where they are deposited, however, the mechanisms underlying these differences have not 
been elucidated to date.
In the K/BxN model, IgG autoantibodies to the ubiquitous glycolytic enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate isomerase (GPI) form ICs with GPI and are preferentially deposited on the 
cartilage surface of the joint where they led to the local activation of the alternative 
complement pathway (AP) (14, 15). This model has similarities to human RA where joint 
tissue is frequently covered with ICs, and autoantibodies to ubiquitously expressed 
citrullinated self protein antigens (ACPAs) are present in the majority of patients with RA 
(16). As in other IgG IC-mediated diseases, neutrophil infiltration into the joint is critical for 
arthritis in the K/BxN mouse model as it is for joint inflammation in RA (17). Once in the 
joint, neutrophils become activated and release powerful proteases, cytokines, chemokines, 
and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (18). Thus, neutrophils are essential initiators of 
IC-induced inflammation, including in the K/BxN model of arthritis as well as in RA. 
Neutrophils not only induce tissue destruction themselves, but also profoundly influence the

 biology of other immune and structural cells of tissue, including in the joint that lead to RA 
(18). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the entry of 
neutrophils into tissues, such as the joint, could be broadly helpful in understanding the 
pathogenesis of IC-induced inflammation and aid in the development of new therapies.
The β2 integrin LFA-1 and four neutrophil chemoattractant receptors (CARs), C5aR the 
leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1), the CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), and the CXC 
chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), are all required on neutrophils for the development of 
arthritis in the K/BxN model of autoantibody IC-induced arthritis (6, 14, 19–22). While we 
have been able to suggest a temporal order for the requirement of these diverse CARs (23), 
we have not been able to decipher their respective functional roles in controlling neutrophil 
entry into the joint using traditional endpoint analysis. Further, it is not known what induces 
the very first neutrophils to enter the joint to initiate arthritis in this model. In fact, it has 
been proposed that sentinel tissue dwelling neutrophils are the key cell that initiates 
inflammation in this model of IC-induced tissue inflammation (24).
Recent advances in imaging technology have provided unprecedented views into immune 
cell migration in live animals that have deepened our understanding of the molecular control 
of immune cell trafficking into tissue in vivo (25). This process begins with the capture of 
free-flowing leukocytes on the vessel wall, followed by 1) tethering and rolling on the vessel 
wall in the direction of flow, 2) firm arrest on the endothelium, 3) release from arrest, 
spreading out and crawling in all directions on the vessel to locate a receptive location for 4) 
transendothelial migration (TEM) to extravasate into the tissue (26). Thus, applying MP-
IVM to study IC-induced inflammation in the joint has the potential to take our 
understanding of IC-induced inflammation and immune cell entry into the joint to an 
entirely new level by allowing the real time visualization of the events that lead to arthritis in 
live mice.
Here, using a new joint imaging technique in live mice, we demonstrate that C5a is 
specifically presented on joint endothelium where it directly initiates neutrophil adhesion 
through its receptor C5aR expressed on neutrophils, igniting joint inflammation in a model 
of IC-induced arthritis.
RESULTS
C5aR is required for neutrophil adhesion in immune complex-induced arthritis
Multiple chemoattractant receptors (CARs) expressed on neutrophils are required for the 
development of joint inflammation in the K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis (Fig. 1A). 
C5aR and BLT1 are absolutely required for arthritis as is the enzyme 5-lipoxgenase (5-LO) 
(Alox5−/−), which is required for the generation of LTB4, the BLT1 ligand. The chemokine 
receptors CCR1 and CXCR2 also contribute importantly to the development of arthritis and 
together are absolutely required for arthritis (Fig. 1A). These endpoint studies while 
informative are not able to ascertain the individual respective roles of the CA pathways in 
the control of neutrophil entry into the joint.

 We have adapted MP-IVM in live mice to image the individual roles of the CARs implicated 
in neutrophil recruitment into the joint and the development of arthritis in real time (27). We 
have used LysM-GFP mice where expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is 
driven by the lysozyme M promoter, resulting in GFP positive neutrophils and monocytes, to 
visualize neutrophil migratory behavior in the joints in vivo. Imaging joints of control (no 
arthritis) and arthritic wild type (WT)-LysM-GFP mice revealed the applicability of this 
technique (Fig. 1B, C; movie S1). Control mice had very few neutrophils visibly interacting 
with blood vessels of the joint and no neutrophils were visible outside of blood vessels (Fig. 
1B; movie S1). In contrast, on day 7 following arthritogenic serum transfer (AST), 
neutrophils were detected adhered to blood vessels. This included cells that were still round 
and firmly arrested as well as cells that had spread out and were crawling on the 
endothelium in multiple directions (Fig. 1C; movie S1). In addition, many neutrophils were 
also seen outside of blood vessels, and were observed to be actively mobile and moving in 
multiple directions in inflamed joints (Fig. 1C; movie S1).
To reveal how deficiency in CARs might influence neutrophil migratory behavior in the 
joint, we imaged Blt1-KO-, C5ar-KO-, Alox-5-KO-, Ccr1-KO-, Cxcr2-KO- and Ccr1-
Cxcr2-DKO-LysM-GFP mice 7 days after AST. We observed a striking phenotype in C5ar-
KO mice: Neutrophils were not able to adhere to blood vessels of the joint (Fig. 1D; movie 
S1). The number of newly adherent neutrophils in C5ar-KO-LysM-GFP mice was 
dramatically less than other CARs-KO mice during the 30 mins of observation (Fig. 1J). In 
contrast, neutrophils were able to adhere to joint blood vessels in the other CAR-KO and 
Alox-5-KO mice on day 7 after AST (Fig. 1E–I; movie S1). However, the number of newly 
extravasated neutrophils that entered the tissue during the 30 mins of observation was 
markedly less in all CARs-KO and Alox-5-KO mice compared WT mice (Fig. 1K). These 
data demonstrate that C5aR plays a role in initiating neutrophil adhesion in the model, and 
that the other CARs participate in the process of neutrophil entry into the joint but at later 
stages in the process.
Cell intrinsic role for C5aR in neutrophil adhesion in the inflamed joint
To study the cell intrinsic role for each CAR in neutrophil migratory behavior in the setting 
of full-blown arthritis, we imaged joints 2 hours after adoptively transferring purified Actin-
RFP-WT and Actin-GFP-CAR-KO neutrophils into WT mice that had received AST 7 days 
prior (fig. S1A). We confirmed that Actin-RFP-WT and Actin-GFP-CAR-KO neutrophils 
were present in a 1:1 ratio in the blood (fig. S1B). In these experiments, we were able to 
analyze neutrophil recruitment according to three defined sequential phases of the leukocyte 
migration cascade: firm arrest, spreading/crawling and extravasation (Fig. 2A). As was 
observed in C5ar-KO mice, markedly fewer C5ar-KO neutrophils were observed arrested 
and crawling on joint blood vessels compared to WT neutrophils when co-transferred into 
WT mice with arthritis (Fig. 2B, G, H). In contrast, other CAR-KO neutrophils did not 
display any defect in arrest or crawling compared with co-adoptively transferred WT 
neutrophils (Fig. 2C–H). However, as was observed for gene-deficient mice, adoptively 
transferred CAR-KO neutrophils studied had impaired extravasation when compared to co-
adoptively transferred WT neutrophils (Fig. 2I). In addition, there was a marked delay in the 
time to firm arrest, spreading/crawling and extravasation for C5ar-KO neutrophils compared

 to WT neutrophils while there was only a delay in the time to extravasation for the other 
CAR-KO neutrophils studied (fig. S1C). As might be expected in the setting of full-blown 
arthritis, the phenotype of adoptively transferred CAR-KO neutrophils was less dramatic 
than what was observed for neutrophils in CAR-KO mice where all neutrophils were CAR-
deficient and mice had no evidence of joint inflammation.
To confirm the cell intrinsic role of C5aR in neutrophil adhesion and the cell intrinsic role of 
the other CARs in neutrophil extravasation, we generated mixed bone marrow chimeric 
(BMC) mice (fig. S2A). In these mice, BM cells from WT-Actin-RFP and CARs-KO-Actin-
GFP mice were transferred in a 1:1 ratio into irradiated WT mice to determine the cell 
intrinsic effect of CAR-deficiency in mice over the entire course of arthritis development 
(fig. S2B). All of the mixed BMC mice developed arthritis following AST, although as 
might be expected, mixed BMC mice developed less severe arthritis than BMC control mice 
(WT BM into irradiated WT mice) (Fig. 3A). Again, markedly fewer C5ar-KO neutrophils 
were observed sticking to the joint endothelium, compared to WT neutrophils in these mixed 
BMC that developed arthritis (Fig. 3B, F). As was seen in the adoptive transfer experiments, 
the other CAR-KO neutrophils studied did not exhibit defects in adhesion to the joint 
endothelium, compared with WT neutrophils in arthritic BMC mice (Fig. 3C–F). However, 
all of the CAR-KO neutrophils studied in the mixed BMC mice had impaired extravasation 
compared to WT neutrophils following AST (Fig. 3G). Again, as might be expected, the 
phenotype of CAR-KO neutrophils in the mixed BMC arthritic mice was less dramatic than 
what was observed for neutrophils in CAR-KO mice where all neutrophils were CAR 
deficient and mice had no evidence of joint inflammation. These data confirm the conclusion 
that C5aR is uniquely required for initial neutrophil adhesion in this model, whereas other 
CARs contribute to extravasation into inflamed joints.
C5aR and CCR1 mediate neutrophil-endothelium interactions at different stages of the 
adhesion cascade
In the co-adoptive transfer experiments, we found that within 5 mins after arrest on the 
endothelium in arthritic joints, WT, Ccr1-, Cxcr2-, Ccr1-Cxcr2- and Blt1-KO neutrophils 
transformed their shape from round to amoeboid and initiated crawling (Fig. 4A; movie S2). 
In contrast, C5ar-KO neutrophils that managed to arrest on the endothelium in arthritic mice, 
maintained their round shape (circularity) as measured by Image J software, could not 
spread, and eventually detached (Fig. 4A, B; movie S2). Of note, ~40% of C5ar-KO arrested 
neutrophils detached in the adoptive transfer experiments, which is a phenomenon that was 
not observed for adoptively transferred WT neutrophils (Fig. 4C, D; movie S3). In addition, 
~20% of adoptively transferred Ccr1-KO and Ccr1-Cxcr2-DKO neutrophils that initiated 
crawling were observed to detach from the endothelium, a phenomenon that was also not 
observed for WT adoptively transferred neutrophils that initiated crawling (Fig. 4E, F, G; 
movie S3). Cxcr2-KO crawling neutrophils did not detach, suggesting that detachment of 
Ccr1-Cxcr2-DKO crawling neutrophils was the result of a CCR1 deficiency.
We observed the same detachment phenotypes for C5ar-KO, Ccr1-KO and Ccr1-Cxcr2-
DKO neutrophils in mixed BMC mice following serum transfer (fig. S2C–F). C5ar-KO 
neutrophils that were able to arrest were observed to detach from the endothelium of arthritic

 joints in mixed C5ar-KO:WT BMC mice. Likewise, Ccr1-KO and Ccr1-Cxcr2-DKO 
neutrophils that initiated crawling were observed to detach from the endothelium of arthritis 
joints in Ccr1-KO:WT and Ccr1-Cxcr2-DKO:WT mixed BMC mice, respectively. These 
detachment phenotypes were not observed for WT neutrophils in these mice (fig. S2C–F). 
Cxcr2-KO neutrophils were not observed to detach after initiating crawling on joint 
endothelium in Cxcr2-KO:WT mixed BMC mice, again suggesting that detachment of Ccr1-
Cxcr2-DKO crawling neutrophils was the result of a CCR1 deficiency. Taken together, these 
data suggest that C5aR signaling in neutrophils is also important for transition from firm 
arrest to spreading and crawling while CCR1 signaling is important to maintain cell 
crawling on the endothelium of the joint in this model as the cell probes for a receptive 
location to undergo TEM.
Early generation of C5a in the joint and retention on joint endothelium
To determine the kinetics of neutrophil CA generation in the model, we analyzed synovial 
fluid (SF) from control and arthritic mice on days 1, 3 and 7 after AST for levels of CAs by 
ELISA (Fig. 5A). In the joint space, C5a generation could be detected on day 1 after AST 
and rose to 76.33 ± 4.33 pM by day 3 and 856.7 ± 72.19 pM by day 7. LTB4 production was 
detected beginning on day 3 and rose to 146.7 ± 27.28 pM by day 7. Chemokines were first 
detected on day 7. These data demonstrate that C5a is generated in the joint first followed by 
LTB4 and then chemokines.
C5a deposition was detected on joint cartilage in mice with arthritis (day 7) but not in the 
joints of control mice (Fig. 5B, C). In addition, C5a immunoreactivity was also detected on 
VWF+ endothelium of joints in arthritic mice, but not on the endothelium in the joints of 
control mice (Fig. 5D, E). Further, we did not detect C5a decorating VWF+ endothelium of 
other organs from the same arthritic mice, including the aorta, coronary artery, superior vein 
cava, kidney and lung (fig. S3).
Since other basic CAs, like many of the chemokines, bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans 
(HSPG) on the surface of ECs, we tested if C5a also has this property. C5a bound directly to 
HSPG, and, as would be expected, heparin inhibited this interaction (Fig. 5F). In addition, 
C5a was able to bind to ECs and induce neutrophil adhesion in vitro (Fig. 5G). C5a binding 
to ECs was also inhibited by heparin, suggesting that C5a was binding to HSPG expressed 
on the surface of ECs. Thus, C5a generated in the joint space is captured by HSPG 
expressed on joint ECs and this initiates the neutrophil adhesion cascade in the joint.
C5a is a strong initiator of neutrophil adhesion in the joint
To directly demonstrate that C5a induces neutrophil adhesion in vivo, we developed an in 
vivo neutrophil adhesion and extravasation assay. Joints of control WT-LysM-GFP mice 
were surgically exposed and exogenous CAs were added to the surface of the exposed joint 
and imaged for 30 mins. All CAs tested were able to induce neutrophil adhesion and 
extravasation in the joint, compared to the PBS control (Fig. 6A–F; movie S4). Interestingly, 
C5a was the most efficacious CA at inducing adhesion and the least efficacious at inducing 
extravasation (Fig. 6G). In contrast, CXCL1 was the most efficacious at inducing neutrophil 
extravasation (Fig. 6H). C5a-induced neutrophil adhesion was dose-dependent (0.1–100.0

 nM) with maximal adhesion seen at 10 nM (fig. S4A, B). Surprisingly, even though we 
imaged for 120 mins, C5a (10nM) did not induce neutrophil extravasation to nearly the same 
extent as CXCL1 (1nM) (fig. S4C, D). C5a-induced neutrophil adhesion was also observed 
in the joint of Blt1-KO and Ccr1-Cxcr2-DKO-LysM-GFP mice, suggesting that C5a-C5aR 
signaling directly induces adhesion (fig. S4E–G). These data suggest that C5a is a potent, 
direct initiator of neutrophil adhesion in the joint in vivo.
C5a induced neutrophil adhesion via β2 integrin activation
To determine if C5a-induced neutrophil adhesion was mediated by β2 integrins, we 
performed an in vitro adhesion on ICAM-1 coated plates. C5a induced neutrophil binding to 
ICAM-1, suggesting that C5a activates β2 integrins on neutrophils (Fig. 7A). Next, to detect 
which β2 integrin is important for C5a-mediated adhesion, we inhibited Mac-1 and LFA-1 
using blocking antibodies. Inhibition of Mac-1 or LFA-1 partially inhibited C5a-induced 
neutrophil adhesion, and blocking both Mac-1 and LFA-1 was additive (Fig. 7A). These data 
suggest that C5a activates both LFA-1 and Mac-1 on neutrophils and induces neutrophil 
adhesion in vitro.
We then compared the expression levels of β2 integrin on BM, blood and SF neutrophils 
isolated from arthritic mice (day 7). LFA-1 and Mac-1 were highly expressed on the surface 
of neutrophils isolated form the BM, blood and SF of arthritic mice (fig. S5A). In addition, 
we confirmed that deficiency of CARs on neutrophils did not alter LFA-1 and Mac-1 levels 
on BM neutrophils (fig. S5B). Next, we analyzed if C5a-mediated neutrophil adhesion in 
vivo was mediated by β2 integrin activation using our in vivo adhesion assay. Blocking 
Mac-1 or LFA-1 inhibited C5a-induced neutrophil adhesion in the joint (Fig. 7B–E; movie 
S5). Dual blockade of LFA-1 and Mac-1 was even more effective than single blockade at 
inhibiting C5a-induced neutrophil adhesion in vivo (Fig. 7B, F; movie S5). Thus, these in 
vivo studies confirm our in vitro findings demonstrating that C5a-C5aR signaling on 
neutrophils activates β2 integrin, inducing neutrophil adhesion in the joint.
In addition, blockade of β2 integrins resulted in neutrophil detachment after C5a-induced 
adhesion (Fig. 6G–H; movie S6). LFA-1 blockade induced crawling neutrophils to detach 
from the endothelium (Fig. 6G; movie S6), while blockade of both Mac-1 and LFA-1 also 
induced arrested neutrophils to detach (Fig. 6H; movie S6). These data suggest that LFA-1 
primarily mediates the strength of the interaction of C5aR-activated neutrophils with the 
endothelium.
CXCR2 ligands promote neutrophil recruitment and survival in the joint
The spontaneous production of neutrophil active chemokines from neutrophils isolated from 
the blood and joint of arthritic and control mice was determined by ELISA. Neutrophils 
isolated from the BM and blood of control mice did not spontaneous release neutrophil-
active chemokines, including CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL3. In contrast, neutrophils isolated 
from SF and blood, but not BM, of arthritic mice spontaneously produced CXCL2 (Fig. 8A), 
suggesting that activated neutrophils spontaneously release CXCL2.
We also analyzed the cell surface expression of the neutrophil active CARs studied here - 
C5aR, BLT1 CCR1 and CXCR2 - on neutrophils isolated from the BM, blood and SF of 
Miyabe et al.

 arthritic mice. C5aR, BLT1 and CCR1 were expressed on BM, blood and SF neutrophils and 
the levels of these CARs were similar on neutrophils isolated from these three compartments 
(Fig 8B). In contrast, CXCR2 surface expression was low on BM neutrophils and increased 
markedly on neutrophils as they moved into the blood and then into the SF (Fig. 8B).
We also analyzed the kinetics of neutrophil accumulation in the SF of mixed BMC mice that 
had received AST 1, 3 and 7 days prior. In all mixed BMC mice, the ratio of WT and CAR-
KO neutrophils in blood was equal over the entire course of arthritis (Fig. 8C–F). Initially, at 
day 1 after AST, the vast majority of neutrophils in the SF were WT (Fig. 8C–F). However 
the % C5ar-KO, Blt1-KO and Ccr1-KO neutrophils in SF increased over time (Fig. 8C, E 
and F). In contrast, Cxcr2-KO neutrophils did not increase in SF over time (Fig. 8D). These 
data suggest that CXCR2 promotes recruitment of C5ar-KO neutrophils into the arthritic 
joint after disease onset. In addition, we tested if CXCR2 also contributes to neutrophil 
survival once in the joint given reports that RA SF can prevent neutrophil apoptosis (28). SF 
neutrophils were isolated from the joints of arthritic mice (day 7 after AST) and incubated 
for 48 hours with CXCL1 and/or CXCL2. Apoptotic cells were identified as Annexin V+ 
and necrotic cells as PI+. Culture of SF neutrophils with CXCR2 ligands markedly reduced 
the population of Annexin V+ neutrophils, suggesting apoptosis was dramatically inhibited 
compared to untreated SF neutrophils (Fig. 8H). These data suggest that in addition to 
amplifying neutrophil recruitment into the joint, CXCR2 also directly promotes the survival 
of neutrophils once in the inflamed joint.
DISCUSSION
While it is known that IC are important inducers of tissue inflammation, the mechanism by 
which IC deposition leads to the recruitment of immune cells into tissue is not known. Using 
a joint imaging technique in live mice and a murine model of IC-induced arthritis, we have 
identified a new role for C5a as the direct initiator of this process in the joint: C5a presented 
on joint endothelium activated C5aR on neutrophils inducing β2 integrin-dependent 
neutrophil adhesion. C5aR signaling also facilitated the transition of neutrophils from firm 
arrest to spreading and crawling for subsequent BLT1-dependent extravasation of the very 
first neutrophils into the joint. CCR1 contributed to the interaction of crawling neutrophils 
with the joint endothelium and CXCR2 amplified late neutrophil recruitment and promoted 
neutrophil survival once in the joint. Thus we have defined the roles of the CAR system in 
collaborating to control neutrophil recruitment into tissue in a type III hypersensitivity IC 
reaction. In so doing we have also demonstrated a role for C5a in directly initiating 
neutrophil recruitment and inflammation in the joint following IC deposition.
In the K/BxN model, circulating IC induce the production of vasoactive amines from 
radioresistant FcRγ-expressing cells that reside in the liver (13). This results in a localized 
transient vascular leak in the joint, which leads to the delivery of ICs into the joint space and 
their deposition on the surface of joint cartilage (13, 15). Given that the cartilage surface has 
a relative paucity of inhibitory complement regulatory proteins, such as decay accelerating 
factor, this leads to the local activation of the AP and the generation of C5a as ICs augment 
the spontaneous autoactivation of C3 in a process termed “tick-over” (15, 29). Consistent 
with this hypothesis, C3 is also required for arthritis in this model (14). C3 and its receptor

 C3aR have also been implicated in RA pathogenesis (30), and AP activation has been 
associated with disease activity in adult and juvenile RA (31, 32).
Our data now demonstrate that C5a specifically decorates the inflamed joint endothelium 
and this is critical for activation of β2 integrins on neutrophils and the adhesion of the very 
first neutrophils, which initiates joint-specific inflammation. We found that C5a was 
generated in the joint space prior to the generation of the other CAs. C5aR was expressed on 
blood neutrophils as well as those recovered from the BM and SF, demonstrating that C5aR 
can respond to endothelially presented C5a to induce initial neutrophil adhesion on joint 
blood vessels. C5a was able to bind directly to joint endothelium as well as to HSPG in vitro 
and both of these interactions were inhibited by heparin. Further, C5a superfused on joints in 
live mice was the most potent CA at inducing neutrophil adhesion and was the least 
efficacious at inducing extravasation. We therefore postulate that much like chemokines, 
locally produced C5a is bound by HSPG on EC and this retains C5a locally, presenting it to 
rolling neutrophils. It is also possible that similar to what has been proposed for chemokines, 
C5a generated in the joint is transported to the surface of ECs by an atypical CAR-like 
receptor, such as C5L2. In fact, atypical chemokine receptor ACKR1 could transport 
inflammatory chemokines from the ablumin to the lumin of blood vessels (33). It has also 
been reported that C5aR is expressed at low levels on EC, and that C5aR signaling can 
induce the expression of ICAM-1 on HUVECs in vitro as well as disrupt vascular integrity 
(34, 35), both of which could contribute to joint inflammation. In the K/BxN model, 
however, C5aR on ECs does not play a major role as BMC experiments demonstrated that 
C5aR was only required on hematopoietic cells for the development of arthritis (36).
In addition to mediating initial adhesion, C5aR signaling also played a role in the transition 
to spreading and crawling. In co-adoptive transfer experiments and in mixed BMC 
experiments, we found that adherent C5ar-KO neutrophils were prone to detach from the 
endothelium. This phenotype is something that was not observed for WT neutrophils. Thus, 
the strength and/or duration of arrest likely contribute to the ability of neutrophils to 
transition from firm arrest to spreading and crawling. Both Mac-1 and LFA-1 contributes to 
the strength of zymosan-activated neutrophil adhesion to ECs with LFA-1 playing a more 
important role (37). The intraluminal crawling that follows arrest and spreading is essential 
for TEM (38). In TNF-activated and CXCL2-superfused cremaster muscle venules, 
neutrophil arrest and crawling were mediated by β2-integrins and their ligands ICAM-1 and 
ICAM-2. Arrest was mainly mediated by LFA-1, whereas luminal crawling was mainly 
mediated by Mac-1 (38, 39). Our data demonstrated that C5a induced both Mac-1- and 
LFA-1-mediated neutrophil adhesion in vitro and in vivo and that LFA-1 played a more 
important role in mediating the strength of the interaction with the endothelium. Thus, C5a-
C5aR signaling activates Mac-1 and LFA-1 on neutrophils for adhesion and interaction with 
the endothelium.
How other CARs collaborate with C5aR to induce adherent neutrophils to enter into the 
inflamed joint in this model is largely unknown. However, like C5ar-KO mice, Alox-5-KO 
and Blt1-KO mice are completely resistant to the development of arthritis in the K/BxN 
AST model (19, 21). Our in vivo imaging experiments demonstrated that neutrophils were 
not able to extravasate into the joint in these mice following AST. In contrast to neutrophils

 in the C5ar-KO mice, however, neutrophils in Alox-5-KO and Blt1-KO mice were able to 
arrest and transition to crawling following AST. Neutrophils were not able to undergo TEM, 
however, suggesting that LTB4-BLT1 signaling initiates the first neutrophil entry into the 
joint. Given that C5aR signaling is required for LTB4 production in the model (36), and that 
C5a is generated prior to LTB4, our data suggest that C5a-C5aR signaling initiates 
neutrophil adhesion and the production of LTB4, which results in the initial entry of 
neutrophils into the joint, triggering the initiation of arthritis.
Once neutrophils enter the joint and initiate arthritis, C5aR and BLT1 were not absolutely 
required for neutrophil recruitment into the joint. Although our neutrophil co-adoptive 
transfer and mixed BMC experiments revealed a cell intrinsic role for C5aR for adhesion 
and BLT1 for neutrophil TEM, there was only a 50% inhibition of these processes compared 
to their complete absence when the mouse was completely deficient in C5aR or BLT1. The 
reason for these differences likely reflect the fact that in the co-adoptive transfer experiments 
and mixed BMC experiments WT neutrophils are present and enter the joint where they 
become activated and produce cytokines, such as IL-1, and chemokines, such as CXCL2, 
within the joint (20). In addition, neutrophil produced IL-1 induces neutrophil active 
chemokine production from fibroblast like synoviocytes and ECs, which likely then partially 
relieves the absolute requirement for C5aR and BLT. Consistent with this, our data 
demonstrate that production of CXCR2 ligands and CCR1 ligands in the joint occur later 
than the generation of C5a and LTB4, consistent with the hypothesis that C5a and LTB4 are 
required for adhesion and TEM of the very first neutrophils for disease onset, whereas 
chemokines mainly contribute to the amplification and sustainment of neutrophil recruitment 
after disease onset.
In this regard, we also found roles for the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CXCR2 for 
neutrophil recruitment and the pathogenesis of joint inflammation. Ccr1-KO neutrophils 
specifically detached after initiating crawling, a behavior that was not seen for WT or for 
any of the other CAR-deficient neutrophils studied, suggesting that CCR1 contributes to the 
interaction of neutrophils with the endothelium of the joint. CCR1 ligands are well known to 
bind HSPG on ECs (40). Thus, CCR1 appears to support neutrophil extravasation by 
facilitating the ability of neutrophils to crawl on the endothelium of inflamed joints to locate 
receptive locations for TEM. We have also found that CXCR2 is involved with the sustained 
accumulation of neutrophil in the joint at later time points. Our mixed BMC mice 
demonstrated that Cxcr2-KO neutrophils were not found in the SF even at later points. This 
was in contrast to Blt1-, C5ar- and Ccr1-KO neutrophils that accumulated in the SF over 
time. This suggests that CXCR2 plays a role not only in neutrophil recruitment into the joint, 
but also in neutrophil survival once in the SF. Along these lines, we found that CXCR2 
ligands prevented apoptosis SF neutrophils. It is interesting to note that neutrophils are the 
main cell type found in RA SF, which has been shown to prevent neutrophil apoptosis (28).
SF neutrophils from arthritic mice spontaneously secreted high levels of CXCL2 as well as 
produce IL-1, which can induce CXCR2 ligand generation from resident cells in the joints 
(20). A recent study also demonstrated that IC can induce CXCL2 production from 
neutrophils, and that CXCL2 released from neutrophils can induce CXCL1 production from 
macrophages (41), suggested that neutrophils are well equipped to self-regulate their own

 recruitment. Using an in vivo recruitment assay, we found that CXCL1 was the most 
efficacious CA at inducing neutrophil extravasation into the joint. We also found that levels 
of CXCR2 were higher on neutrophils isolated from the SF compared to the blood and BM 
of arthritic mice. Our data therefore demonstrate that CXCR2 is an important mediator of 
late neutrophil recruitment and possibly survival in the joint space of arthritic mice.
Thus imaging immune-complex induced arthritis has defined a new mechanism for a type III 
hypersensitivity where C5a directly initiates neutrophil adhesion on the joint endothelium, 
resulting in neutrophil recruitment into the joint and the development of arthritis. These 
conclusions have some important limitations. First, the mechanism described here for the 
joint is likely different from other organs where tissue-resident cells have been shown to 
play an important role in initiating inflammation, and where C5a indirectly contributes to 
inflammation by activating resident immune cells (9, 10). The unique environment of the 
joint with a paucity of resident immune cells may be a determining factor for the critical 
proximal role of C5a and C5aR in initiating IC-induced arthritis. Further, the prominent role 
for C5a described here many not be applicable to other models of RA or to human RA 
where the role of IC in driving joint inflammation is likely more heterogeneous.
In summary, imaging arthritis has identified a mechanism whereby the C5a-C5aR pathway 
directly controls neutrophil adhesion on the endothelium and then facilitates their transition 
to crawling for subsequent BLT1-mediated entry into the joint to ignite inflammation. We 
have also found new roles of CCR1 in mediating neutrophil crawling on the endothelium 
and CXCR2 in mediating neutrophil survival in the joints space. Thus, we have defined how 
the CAR system collaborates to control neutrophil entry into the joint following IC 
deposition (fig. S6), and in so doing have established a new paradigm for type III 
hypersensitivity.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Study design
The aim of this study was to use in vivo joint imaging in live mice to determine the 
respective roles of C5aR, BLT1, CCR1 and CXCR2 in the recruitment of neutrophils into 
the joint in an IC-induced model of arthritis. Age (8–10 week old)- and sex (only male)-
matched WT and CARs-KO mice bred and housed in the same faculty at Massachusetts 
General Hospital were used for this study. The sample size was determined to achieve a 
power of 90%, accepting type I error rate of 0.05. Analysis of movies as well as in vitro 
adhesion assays and flow cytometry was performed by an investigator blinded to the 
experimental groups. Randomization and blinding were not used for in vivo joint imaging.
Mice
K/BxN mice were obtained by crossing KRN with NOD/LtJ mice (Jackson Laboratory). 
Ltb4r1−/− (42), C5ar−/− (43), Alox-5−/− (44), Cxcr2−/− (45) and Ccr1−/− (46), LysM-GFP 
(47) mice were maintained in our laboratory. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from 
the Charles River. C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)131Osb/LeySopJ (Actin-GFP) and B6.Cg-
Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J (Actin-RFP) were purchased from Jackson laboratory.

 Ccr1−/−Cxcr2−/− mice were generated by crossing Ccr1−/− and Cxcr2−/− mice, CARs-KO-
LysM-GFP and Actin-GFP mice were generated by crossing CARs-KO mice and WT-
LysM-GFP or WT-Actin-GFP mice, and genotypes were confirmed by Transnetyx, Inc. All 
experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Massachusetts General 
Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care.
Serum Transfer and Arthritis Scoring
Pooled serum from 8-week-old arthritic K/BxN mice was transferred into recipient mice 
(100 μl) intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 0 and 2 as described (27). Clinical arthritis was 
scored as described (27).
Multiphoton Intravital Microscopy and Image Analysis
To perform MP-IVM, the ankle joint located 100 to 150 μm below the skin surface of 
anaesthetized mice was depilated, microsurgically exposed and fixed by tissue bond to glass 
slide on the microscope stage as described (27). Multiphoton excitation was obtained 
through DeepSee and MaiTai Ti:sapphire lasers (Newport/Spectra-Physics) tuned to 820 and 
920 nm to excite all fluorescent probes used. Stacks of 11 square optical sections with 4 μm 
z-spacing were acquired on an Ultima IV multiphoton microscope (Prairie Technologies) 
every 15s with optical zoom of 2× to provide image volumes 40 μm in depth and 307 μm in 
width. Emitted fluorescence was detected through 460/50, 525/50, 595/50, 660/40 band-pass 
filters and non-descanned detectors to generate four-color images. Sequences of image 
stacks were transformed into volume- rendered, time-lapse movies with Imaris software 
(Bitplane). (1) Imaging of endogeneous neutrophils: Imaging joints of WT or CARs-KO-
LysM-GFP mice on day 7 after AST was observed for 30 mins. The number of neutrophils 
that were observed to newly stick, including arrest and crawling, and newly extravasate, was 
quantitated. Neutrophils were distinguished by their size, shape, and migratory behavior. (2) 
Imaging adoptively transferred neutrophils: BM neutrophils were isolated by EasySep kit as 
described (27). Total 1 × 107 isolated BM neutrophils (5 × 106 BM WT Actin-RFP and 5 × 
106 BM CAR-KO Actin-GFP neutrophils) were transferred into arthritic WT mice on day 7 
following AST, which were matched for the same clinical arthritis score. Joints were imaged 
for 120 mins after BM neutrophil transfers. Population of circulating WT-GFP+ and CARs-
KO-RFP+ neutrophils were confirmed by flow cytometry. Neutrophils were scored for the 
number that arrested, crawled and extravasated during the observation period. Arrest was 
defined as a round shape cell that remained in the same position for at least 30 second. 
Crawling was defined as an amoeboid shape cell that crawled along the inside of blood 
vessel. Extravasation was defined as a neutrophil that had entered into the tissue (27). (3) In 
vivo adhesion assay: CAs [0.1pmol: C5a (R&D), CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL3 (PeproTech) and 
LTB4 (Tocris Bioscience)] dissolved with sterile PBS (100μl) was placed on the joints of 
WT-LysM-GFP mice, and imaged for 30 mins. Mac-1 and/or LFA-1 antibodies or isotype 
control antibody (100μg/mouse) were intravenously injected 4 hrs before imaging (22). The 
number of new sticking neutrophils as well as extravasated neutrophils was quantitated. All 
data was analyzed by Imaris software. Circularity was calculated using Image J software 
where 1.0 represented a complete circle.

 Generation of mixed BMC mice
Mixed BMC mice were generated according to established protocols (36). Four wks after 
reconstitution mixed BMC mice were used for experiments. Reconstitution was confirmed 
by flow cytometry of blood neutrophil counts at 4 wks after irradiation. BMC mice were 
used if ≥ 95% of neutrophils were of donor origin and WT and CAR-KO neutrophils were 
present in equal numbers.
Flow cytometry
Neutrophils were isolated from BM, blood and SF according to established methods (27). 
Cells were blocked with 2.4G2 anti-FcγRIII/II (BD Biosciences) and stained with the 
following antibodies: APC-conjugated anti-murine Ly6G, FITC-conjucated anti-murine 
CXCR2, PE-conjucated anti-murine C5aR, FITC-conjucated anti-murine CD11a, PE-
conjucated anti-murine CD11b (Biolegend), PE-conjugated anti-murine CCR1 (R&D), 
biotinylated anti-murine BLT1 (3D7, provided by Dr. Haribabu). Biotinylated mouse IgG1 
(R&D) for BLT1, FITC-conjugated rat-IgG2a (Biolegend) for CXCR2 and CD11a, or PE-
conjugated rat-IgG2a (Biolegend) for C5aR, CD11b and CCR1 were used as isotype control 
antibodies. After washing, BLT1 and its isotype control were incubated with PE-conjugated-
streptavidin (eBioscience). Flow cytometry was performed with FACS LSRFortessa (BD 
Bioscience) and analyzed with Flow Jo software. Neutrophils were identified as Ly6G-
positive cells in the granulocyte gate of forward and side scatter plots (fig. S7).
Quantitation of chemoattractants
SF was collected (27) and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 
levels of CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL3, C5a (R&D) and LTB4 (Thermo). Immunomagnetically 
purified neutrophils from BM, blood, and SF were incubated at 2 × 106/ml in RPMI, 10% 
FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37℃, 5% CO2 for 21 
hr. Cell-free cell culture supernatants were assayed for CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL3 (R&D) 
by ELISA.
Immunofluorescence staining
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4μm–thick sections) from control and arthritic mice were 
prepared as described (27). Sections were then blocked with protein block 
(DakoCytomation) for 15 mins and stained with rabbit anti-C5a polyclonal antibody 
(8μg/ml; Bioss antibodies), anti-VWF polyclonal antibody (8μg/ml; LifeSpan Biosciences), 
or normal rabbit IgG (Bioss antibodies) as an isotype control for 60 mins at 25°C. Alexa 
Fluor 488 or 555–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam) were used as secondary 
antibodies and incubated for 1 hour at 25°C. The slides were examined using a fluorescence 
microscope (Carl Zeiss).
C5a binding to HSPG
HSPG (5μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was coated on 96 well assay plates (Coring) overnight at 
25°C. After washing 3 times with PBS with Tween 20 (PBST), 1%FCS/PBS was added to 
each well for 60-min at 25°C to block and then washed 3 times. C5a (1nM; R&D) with or 
without heparin (80μg/ml; Hospira) was loaded onto the well and incubated for 20-min at

 25°C. After washing 3 times with PBST, C5a detection antibody (200ng/ml per well; R&D) 
was incubated for 2-hr at 25°C and washed 3 times with PBST. Streptavidin-HRP (R&D) 
was incubated for 20-min at 25°C and washed 3 times with PBST. Substrate solution 
(Invitrogen) was loaded onto plate for 20-min and 2N H2SO4 was used as a stop solution. 
Absorbance at OD 450nm was evaluated with a SpectraMax Plus 384 (Molecular Device).
In vitro neutrophil adhesion assay
(1) Murine aortic endothelial cells were incubated at a concentration of 2 × 104/well in 
Complete Mouse Endothelial Cell Medium with Endothelial Cell Medium Supplement Kit 
(Cell Biologics) at 37℃, 5% CO2 overnight. The following day, after washing softly 3 times 
with sterile PBS, BM neutrophils isolated from naïve WT mice (1 × 105/well) were loaded 
onto plates with or without C5a (1nM) and/or heparin (80μg/ml) and incubated for 20 mins. 
After removing non-adherent neutrophils by washing 3 times, the number of adherent 
neutrophils was enumerated using microscopy. (2) ICAM-1 (2.5 μg/ml) was coated onto 96 
well plates overnight at 4°C. The following day, the plate was washed by sterile PBS 3 
times. BM neutrophils were isolated from naïve WT mice in RPMI, 10% FCS, 10 mM 
HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated with LFA-1 and/or 
Mac-1 blocking antibodies or isotype control antibody (40 μg/ml) for 20 mins at room 
temperature. BM neutrophils (1 × 105/well) were loaded onto plates with or without C5a 
(1nM) for 20mins at 37℃. After removing non-adherent neutrophils by washing 3 times, the 
number of adherent neutrophils was counted using microscopy.
Analysis of apoptosis
Leukocytes were isolated from the SF of arthritic mice and neutrophils were purified using 
Easy-Sep as previously described (48). Neutrophils (1×105/well) were loaded into 96 well 
plates, and incubated with or without CXCL1 (1nM) and/or CXCL2 (1nM) for 48 hours. 
Neutrophils were analyzed for the presence of apoptosis using an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis 
detecting kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and flow cytometry with FACS LSRFortessa.
Statistics
Data are expressed as the mean ±SEM. All statistical analyses were performed in Prism 5 
(GraphPad Software). Means between two groups were compared with unpaired two-tailed 
Student’s t test. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
