 It is not expected that autophagosome-like struc-
tures can mature into autolysosomes after degra-
dation of the IAM in ATG conjugation–deficient
cells, which suggests that autophagic activity
remains at a very low level. It may explain the
phenotypic difference among ATG KO mice:
Embryonic lethality is observed in mice lacking
upstream ATGs—such as FIP200, ATG9A, and
ATG13 (20–22), whereas mice lacking ATG con-
jugation components, such as ATG3, ATG5, ATG7,
ATG12, and ATG16L1, can survive the embryonic
period (but die shortly after birth) (13, 18, 23–25).
So far, the function of ATG proteins has been
investigated only in the context of autophago-
some formation, but our findings also revealed
a function of ATGs with regard to the matura-
tion steps.

Social status is one of the strongest predictors of human disease risk and mortality, and
it also influences Darwinian fitness in social mammals more generally. To understand the
biological basis of these effects, we combined genomics with a social status manipulation
in female rhesus macaques to investigate how status alters immune function. We
demonstrate causal but largely plastic social status effects on immune cell proportions,
cell type–specific gene expression levels, and the gene expression response to immune
challenge. Further, we identify specific transcription factor signaling pathways that explain
these differences, including low-status–associated polarization of the Toll-like receptor
4 signaling pathway toward a proinflammatory response. Our findings provide insight into
the direct biological effects of social inequality on immune function, thus improving our
understanding of social gradients in health.
M
any human societies exhibit social gra-
dients in health (1). Socioeconomic status
has been called the “fundamental cause”
of health inequalities (2), and, in the United
States, differences between the highest
versus lowest socioeconomic stratum may affect
adult life span by more than a decade (3). These
patterns arise, in part, from differences in resource
access and health risk behaviors. However, studies
in hierarchically organized animal species sug-
gest that they may also be more deeply embedded
in our evolutionary history (4). In rhesus macaques
and long-tailed macaques, social subordination
has been linked to changes in cardiovascular
health, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis func-
tion, inflammation, and gene expression in pe-
ripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (5–7).
Such findings suggest strong parallels between
responses to social adversity in humans and
other social primates, especially in their conse-
quences for the regulation of the immune sys-
tem (8, 9).
We aimed to test how social status influences
immune system function at multiple scales, using
an experimental design that allowed us to infer
its direct causal effects. We experimentally ma-
nipulated the dominance ranks of 45 adult female
rhesus macaques, a species that naturally forms
stable, linear social hierarchies. In captivity, female
rank can be manipulated by sequential introduc-
tion of adult females into newly constructed social
groups, such that earlier introduction predicts
higher status (10) (measured here with contin-
uous Elo ratings: a higher status corresponds
to a higher value) (11). We constructed nine groups
of five female macaques each (table S1). We main-
tained these groups for 1 year (phase one) (Fig. 1,
A and B) and then rearranged group composition
by performing sequential introduction of phase-
one females from the same or adjacent ranks into
new groups, which we again followed for 1 year
(phase two).
Our study maximized within-individual changes
in dominance rank (Pearson’s correlation co-
efficient r = 0.06, P = 0.68 between phases) (fig.
S1), thus avoiding the possibility of confounding
rank effects on immune function with other
study-subject characteristics. In both phases, the
order of introduction predicted social status (phase
one Pearson’s r = –0.57, P = 4.1 × 10−5; phase two
r = –0.68, P = 3.3 × 10−7) (Fig. 1C), and social
status in turn influenced rates of received harass-
ment (higher for low-status females) (Fig. 1D) and
affiliative grooming behavior (higher for high-
status females) (Fig. 1E).

 These manipulations revealed both composi-
tional and cell type–specific effects on the immune
system. Across phases, high-ranking females had
increased proportional representation of CD3+
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [linear mixed model P =
9.9 × 10−3, consistent with (5)] and double-positive
CD3+CD8+CD4+ T cells (P = 6.9 × 10−3) and trended
toward decreased polymorphonuclear and in-
creased natural killer (NK) cell representation
(P = 0.11 for both) (fig. S2). To investigate intra-
cellular changes in gene expression indepen-
dently of variation in leukocyte composition, we
used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate
the five major PBMC cell types: CD3+CD4+ helper
T cells, CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD3–CD20+
B cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD3–CD16+ NK cells
(fig. S3 and table S2). RNA-seq (RNA sequenc-
ing) profiling on the resulting samples (n = 440
female-phase-cell population combinations follow-
ing quality control) (table S3) enabled us to sep-
arate the distinct cell types according to the
relationships expected from hematopoietic cell
differentiation (Fig. 2A).
Within cell types, we identified variable sig-
natures of dominance rank on gene expression
levels. NK cells were by far the most sensitive
to social status [n = 1676 rank-responsive genes,
false discovery rate (FDR) < 10%], followed by a
secondary signal in helper T cells (n = 284 genes).
In contrast, we identified weak effects of domi-
nance rank in B cells and cytotoxic T cells (n = 68
and 15 genes, respectively) and no detectable
effect of dominance rank in purified monocytes
(Fig. 2A and table S4). Within the set of NK cell
rank-responsive genes, Gene Ontology (GO) en-
richment analysis revealed increased expression
of lymphocyte proliferation [Fisher’s exact test
(FET) P = 7.8 × 10−3], innate immune response
(P = 9.9 × 10−4), and cytokine response genes in
low-ranking females (P = 5.0 × 10−4), consistent
with a proinflammatory phenotype (fig. S4 and
table S5). However, this relationship was generally
plastic: Although female ranks were scrambled
between study phases, the effects of rank were
positively correlated and highly directionally con-
cordant between phase one and phase two for
rank-responsive genes (helper T cells: Pearson’s
r = 0.41, P = 1.95 × 10−34, 69.3% concordant; NK
cells: r = 0.49, P = 6.62 × 10−71, 79.7% concordant)
(Fig. 2B and fig. S5). Improvements in social status
are thus rapidly reflected in gene expression pat-
terns, even in relatively long-lived cell types such
as T cells (12).
Our results suggest that most effects of social
status are cell type–specific, in contrast to the high
degree of sharing observed for genetic effects on
gene expression levels [i.e., expression quantitative

 trait loci (13, 14)]. However, analyzing each cell
type in isolation tends to be anticonservative
with respectto cell type specificity, because shared
effects could be missed if a gene falls below the
significance threshold in one cell type but slightly
above it in another. We therefore performed a
meta-analysis on genes that were detectably
expressed in all five cell types and rank-responsive
in at least one cell type (n = 1622 genes). Of the 32
possible combinations of rank effects (present or
absent in each of the five cell types), we identified
an NK-specific configuration as the most com-
mon (n = 363 genes), followed by shared effects
across the two most-sensitive cell types, NK and
helper T cells (n = 207 genes) (Fig. 2C). Thus,
substantial cell type heterogeneity in rank-
responsive genes is supported even when using a
conservative, meta-analytic approach.
We next investigated the behavioral mecha-
nisms that give rise to social status effects on
gene expression, focusing on NK and helper T
cells where the observed effects were strongest.
Mediation analysis revealed that rates of received
harassment—a measure of the agonistic, com-
petitive element of social status inequality—
contributed to these effects for 17.3% (helper T)
and 7.8% (NK) of rank-responsive genes, respec-
tively. However, in rhesus macaques, dominance
rank also influences affiliative social interactions
(15). Grooming rates mediated rank effects on
gene expression levels for 17.6% of genes in helper
T cells, comparable to the results for agonistic
interactions. In contrast, grooming behavior
was more important than harassment for rank-
responsive NK genes (n = 560 genes, 33.4% of all
rank-responsive genes; c2 test P = 1.33 × 10−74) (Fig.
2, D and E). A lack of positive social interactions
may therefore be equally or more important than
social subordination per se in shaping social status
effectsongeneexpression,consistentwiththeknown
effects of social integration on health and mortal-
ity in both humans and other primates (16–18).

 The patterns we observed are most likely to
contribute to social gradients in health if they
affect the ability to respond to external threats,
such as pathogen exposure. Thus, we next tested
for social status–dependent effects on the re-
sponse to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a compo-
nent of Gram-negative bacteria that invokes a
strong inflammatory response [an aspect of im-
mune function thought to be influenced by so-
cial environmental conditions (4, 5, 9)]. We
collected two blood samples from each female
in phase two: (i) a control sample incubated for
4 hours in media and (ii) an experimental sam-
ple incubated in parallel in media plus 1 mg/ml
LPS. We then used RNA-seq to profile gene
expression levels for the white blood cell frac-
tion from each sample (n = 40 LPS and 43
control samples retained after quality control)
(table S3).
Principal components analysis (PCA) of the
gene expression data reveals robust signals of
both condition (control versus LPS) and social
status (Fig. 3A). In both conditions, control and
LPS-stimulated samples separate on PC1 (Student’s
t = 24.72, P = 4.4 × 10−34), and females separate
according to dominance rank on PC2 (Pearson’s
r = 0.83, P = 3.5 × 10−22). Immune stimulation
also exacerbates the effects of rank. Although
social status effects were globally correlated across
conditions (Pearson’s r = 0.50, P < 10−300), we
identified twice as many rank-responsive genes
in the LPS condition than in the control condi-
tion (3494 versus 1799 genes, FDR < 1%) (fig. S6
and table S6). This observation may be partially
explained by status-related variation in gluco-
corticoid (GC) physiology (19). Sensitivity to dexa-
methasone challenge significantly mediated social
status effects on gene expression for 42 rank-
responsive genes in the control condition and
155 genes in the LPS condition, including key
regulators of the inflammatory response such as
TRAF3 and MAP2K1. Further, these GC media-
tion effects were significantly larger in the LPS
condition than in the control condition, consistent
with the known immunomodulatory effects of
GC signaling (Mann-Whitney test P = 1.5 × 10−4)
(fig. S7). These results suggest that social status
directly affects the immune response in addition
to gene expression at the baseline. We identified
1834 genes (FDR < 1%) for which the intensity of
the response to LPS varied depending on domi-
nance rank (table S6), with a stronger overall
response in low-ranking females (Mann-Whitney
test P = 2.0 × 10−145) (Fig. 3B).
We next stratified the data set on the basis of
the direction of the response to LPS and the
direction of the dominance rank effect after LPS
stimulation (Fig. 3C). Among the four resulting
gene sets, only two exhibited biologically coherent
enrichment for specific pathways. Among LPS–
up-regulated genes more highly expressed in
low-status females after stimulation (category I
genes, n = 795 genes), we found enrichment for
GO terms associated with the response to bac-
terial infection (Fig. 3D and table S7), including
the inflammatory response (FET P = 8.4 × 10−10)
and cytokine production (FET P = 4.2 × 10−6).
Notably, category I contains several master reg-
ulators of the innate immune response, including
components of the nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)
transcription factor complex (NFKBID, NFKBIZ,
and NFKB1) (Fig. 3C) and the transcription fac-
tors STAT3 and STAT5A, which are involved in
the response to proinflammatory cytokines and
growth factor signaling (20, 21). In contrast, LPS–
up-regulated genes more highly expressed in high-
status females after stimulation (category II genes,
n = 439 genes) were enriched specifically for GO
terms associated with type I interferon signaling
(Fig. 3D).
To further investigate signaling pathways
associated with categories I and II, we gener-
ated ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible
Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing)
data for PBMCs sampled from three female ma-
caques to identify open chromatin regions. Over-
lapping open chromatin regions with category II
gene locations revealed enrichment for predicted
interferon regulatory factor binding sites within
5 kb of the transcription start site (IRF1, FET P =
7.43 × 10−6; IRF7, P = 3.67 × 10−5) (Fig. 3E and
table S8). In contrast, the same analysis for cat-
egory I genes revealed enrichment for NF-kB
binding sites (RELA/RELB, P = 5.30 × 10−6; NF-
kB, P = 1.88 × 10−5) (Fig. 3E) but no enrichment
for IRF signaling. Notably, binding sites for
inflammation-related transcription factors, in-
cluding NF-kB, were also enriched among social
status–responsive genes in NK cells (fig. S8 and
table S8).
The immune response to LPS is primarily
mediated by monocytes and polymorphonuclear
cells (fig. S9) and, specifically, signaling from
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the receptor for LPS.
LPS binding to TLR4 triggers two alternative

 signaling pathways: a MyD88-dependent pro-
inflammatory pathway, mediated at the transcrip-
tional level by NF-kB, and a TRIF-dependent
antiviral pathway, mediated at the transcrip-
tional level by IRF3 and IRF7 (22). The GO and
transcription factor binding site enrichment anal-
yses for category I and category II genes suggest
that low- and high-status females use different
pathways in response to immune challenges. Spe-
cifically, low-status females show enhanced activa-
tion of the MyD88-dependent pathway, whereas
high-status individuals are shifted toward the
TRIF-dependent antiviral response (Fig. 4A). Rank-
responsive genes induced by LPS via the MyD88-
dependent pathway [on the basis of comparisons
between wild-type and knockout mice (23)] are
almost exclusively category I genes, whereas TRIF-
dependent genes are slightly enriched and MyD88-
dependentgenesaresignificantlyunderrepresented
in category II (Fig. 4, B and C). As a result, median
gene expression levels across all rank-responsive
MyD88-dependent genes are predicted by domi-
nance rank (Pearson’s r = –0.80, P = 4.6 × 10−10)
(Fig. 4D), supporting status-related differences
in the TLR4-mediated immune response.
Together, our findings show that social sub-
ordination alone is sufficient to alter immune
function even in the absence of variation in re-
source access, health care, or health risk behav-
iors. As macaques are close evolutionary relatives
of humans, these results likely point to mech-
anisms that also underlie social status effects
in humans, where experimental studies are not
possible (24). Our results also demonstrate that
social status influences the immune system at
multiple scales, ranging from coarse leukocyte
compositional patterns, to changes in cell type–
specific gene expression patterns, to altered usage
of specific signaling pathways in response to an
immune challenge that models bacterial infec-
tion. In particular, we provide genome-wide exper-
imental evidence for the idea that social hierarchies
polarize the immune response toward a pro-
inflammatory, antibacterial phenotype in low-
status individuals and an antiviral phenotype
in high-status individuals (8). This distinction
raises questions about the disease conditions and
potential selection pressures associated with var-
iation in social status, including whether status
predicts investment in more- or less-costly forms
of immune defense (25). Our findings also lay the
groundwork for further investigation of social
status effects on other aspects of immune func-
tion, such as viral defense and adaptive immunity.

Fig. 4. Dominance rank polarizes TLR4 responses to LPS stimulation. (A) Key players in the MyD88-
dependent and TRIF-dependent response to LPS-induced TLR4 signaling. Rank-responsive genes in
these pathways are shown in blue (category I genes) and purple (category II genes). (B) Rank-responsive
genes that are up-regulated upon stimulation via the MyD88 pathway (“MyD88-induced”) are almost uni-
versally (89.3%) more highly expressed in low-status females in the LPS+ condition, whereas TRIF-induced,
rank-responsive genes are split (Mann-Whitney test for the difference between MyD88-induced and TRIF-
induced genes: P = 8.31 × 10−7). (C) MyD88-induced genes are overrepresented among category I genes
[FET log2(OR) = 1.95, P = 1.6 × 10−15] but significantly underrepresented in category II [log2(OR) = –2.14,
P = 4.1 × 10−4].TRIF-induced genes are significantly overrepresented in category II [log2(OR) = 0.89, P =
0.04]. (D) Median gene expression levels across all MyD88- and TRIF-induced genes for each female, by
female dominance rank.
