ABSTRACT
Background Exposure to audio-visual alcohol content in media is associated with subsequent alcohol use in young people, but the extent of
exposure contained in UK free-to-air prime-time television has not been explored since 2010. We report an analysis of alcohol content in a
sample of UK free-to-air prime-time television broadcasts in 2015 and compare this with a similar analysis from 2010.
Methods Content analysis of all programmes and advertisement/trailer breaks broadcast on the five national UK free-to-air channels in the UK
between 6 and 10 pm during three separate weeks in September, October and November 2015.
Results Alcohol content occurred in over 50% of all programmes broadcast and almost 50% of all advert/trailer periods between programmes.
The majority of alcohol content occurred before the 9 pm watershed. Branding occurred in 3% of coded intervals and involved 122 brands,
though three brands (Heineken, Corona and Fosters) accounted for almost half of all brand appearances.
Conclusion Audio-visual alcohol content, including branding, is prevalent in UK television, and is therefore a potential driver of alcohol use in
young people. These findings are virtually unchanged from our earlier analysis of programme content from 2010.

Introduction
It is estimated that per capita alcohol consumption of pure
alcohol in the those over the age of 15 years in the UK is
12.3 l,1 the eighth highest rate in Europe.2 Alcohol use was
responsible for at least 6813 deaths in the UK in 2015,3 and
cost the NHS £3.5 billion in 2013–14.4 It is estimated that
1.6 million people in the UK have some form of alcohol
dependence.4 Preventing morbidity and mortality from alco-
hol consumption is therefore a public health priority.
Since initiation of alcohol use at a young age is a strong
risk factor for dependence in later life,5 it is important to
identify avoidable causes of alcohol consumption in young
people in the UK. There is strong evidence that exposure to
advertising or other alcohol imagery in the media increases
subsequent use in adolescents.6–24 An estimated 28 million
British homes have at least one television25 and in 2015
average viewing was 3 h, 47 min per person per day.26 The
Office of Communications (OfCom) Broadcasting Code27
(Section 1.10), protects under-18s by restricting depictions
of alcohol use in programmes made for children and pre-
venting the glamorization of alcohol use in programmes
broadcast before the 9 pm watershed,28 or in programmes
likely to be widely seen, heard or accessed by under-18s
without editorial justification. However, 13% of 4–15-year
olds view programmes after the 9 pm watershed29 when
programmes unsuitable for children are allowed to be broad-
cast.28 There are currently no restrictions on when com-
mercial alcohol advertisements can be scheduled,30 and
whilst alcohol advertisements largely adhere to existing reg-
ulations,31 this does not adequately protect against content
that promotes irresponsible and unhealthy consumption,31
particularly
on
adolescent
drinking
behaviours.13–20

 Furthermore, an estimated 62% of 12–15-year olds have
access to a TV in their bedroom, and 45% of children watch
TV on devices such as tablets, allowing TV viewing without
parental control.29 Studies in earlier decades have found that
alcohol imagery appeared frequently in studies of UK televi-
sion,32–36 and the most recent content analysis of UK
broadcast TV found that 40% of programmes contained
alcohol content,36 however, there are no contemporary data
on the amount of alcohol imagery and paid-for advertising
in current TV programming.
While there have been no specific regulation changes since
the previous content analysis in 2010,36 it is important to
monitor a potential risk to public health to ensure compli-
ance with the OfCom guidelines27 (Section 1.10). We have
therefore quantified the content of all programmes and
advertisements/trailers broadcast on all five national UK
free-to-air channels in 2015 to document the amount of
alcohol imagery contained and to explore differences in con-
tent between channels and genres, and compared these with
the findings of our 2010 study.36
Methods
All programmes and advertisements/trailers broadcast on
the five national UK free-to-air channels in the UK (BBC1,
BBC2, ITV1, Channels 4 and 5) were recorded during the
peak viewing hours of 6–10 p.m. capturing data on the 3 h
before and 1 h after the Office of Communications (OfCom)
9 pm watershed. All programmes, and all advertisements
and/or trailers for other programmes broadcast in these time
intervals were recorded in three separate weeks (Monday–
Sunday) in 2015, with a 4-week gap between each (21–27
September, 18–25 October, 16–22 November). At the time
of the study these five channels were the most watched chan-
nels in the UK,37 and remain so today.38 Two of the channels,
BBC1 and BBC2, are public service channels with no com-
mercial advertising, while ITV1, Channels 4 and 5 all feature
commercial advertising. All recorded footage was viewed and
coded using the 1-min interval period method previously
described by Lyons et al.36 The method includes recording the
presence or absence of audio-visual alcohol content every 1-
min and in the following categories:
Actual use: Use of alcohol on screen by any character
Implied use: Any inferred alcohol use without any actual use
on screen.
Other alcohol reference: The presence on screen of alcohol or
other related materials
Brand appearance: The presence of clear and unambiguous
branding
Alcohol appearances were recorded if they appeared on
screen in any 1-min coding period. Multiple instances of the
same category in the same 1-min period were considered a
single event, however, if two instances of different categories
occurred this was recorded as two different events (e.g. actual
alcohol use and inferred use). When the same appearance
transitioned into a new 1-min period it was coded as two sep-
arate events as the appearance occurred in two, 1-min inter-
vals. We categorized the genre of each programme based on
information from Box of Broadcasts39 and the researcher’s
discretion when genre not available. The periods between pro-
grammes containing trailers for forthcoming broadcasts on
BBC1 and BBC2, and those including trailers and/or com-
mercial advertising between or within programmes on ITV1,
Channel 4 or Channel 5 were coded separately from pro-
grammes as a single category of advert/trailer content. One-
third of the recorded footage was coded separately by two
authors (A.B. and K.W
.) to ensure accuracy and reliability in
the coding method. Data were analysed descriptively with sep-
arate analyses conducted to compare content broadcast before
or after the 9 pm watershed, between the five channels, and
between the programme genres observed.
Results
A total of 611 programmes and 1140 advert/trailer periods
comprising 27 083 1-min intervals (22 960 from pro-
grammes and 4123 from adverts/trailers) were recorded
during the peak viewing hours of 6–10 pm from Monday to
Sunday in 3 separate weeks. The most frequent programme
genres were News and Current Affairs, Documentaries, and
Soap Operas (totalling 137, 126 and 76 programmes respect-
ively). The genres accounting for the greatest broadcast time
were Documentaries, News and Current Affairs, and
Entertainment, with 5482, 3573 and 2408 min, respectively.
Any alcohol content
Any alcohol content appeared in a total of 3734 intervals
(14% of the total) (Fig. 1). Of the 611 programmes broad-
cast, 412 (67%) contained any alcohol content, occurring in
3002 (14% of all intervals from programmes) 1-min inter-
vals. Of advert/trailer periods, 524 (47%) contained any
alcohol content, occurring in 732 (18% of all intervals from
advert/trailer periods) 1-min intervals.
The channel broadcasting the greatest number of alcohol
appearances was ITV, which accounted for 1081 intervals
(29% of all alcohol intervals) and with alcohol appearances
occurring in 226 programmes (62% of all broadcasts on
ITV). ITV also had the most alcohol appearances in both
programmes (20% of all intervals from programmes, 83%

 of all programmes) and advert/trailer periods (55% of all
advert/trailer periods, 18% of all intervals from advert/
trailer periods containing alcohol). The lowest number of
alcohol appearances occurred on BBC2, with 508 intervals
(14% of all alcohol intervals) across 91 broadcasts (40% of
all broadcasts). BBC2 also had the lowest number of alcohol
appearances in both programmes (63% of all broadcasts,
10% of all programme intervals containing alcohol) and
advert/trailer periods (15% of all advert/trailer periods, 7%
of all intervals from advert/trailer periods containing alco-
hol; see Table S1 in the online Supplementary file 1). ‘Other
Alcohol References’ were the most frequent form of alcohol
appearance on each channel. When compared to an earlier
analysis of UK TV footage using the same methods, the
results appear to be virtually unchanged, see Fig. 2.
The proportion of programme genres containing the
highest alcohol content, defined by any alcohol content in
the show, were Cookery (all cookery programmes included
alcohol content), Soap Opera (99% included alcohol con-
tent) and Drama (94% included alcohol content) (Fig. 3;
note that the high proportion of Education programmes
containing alcohol arises from a single programme).
Of the 1120 advert/trailer periods analysed, 524 (47%)
contained any alcohol content, occurring in 732 (18%) of
4123 1-min intervals. The 75% of programming in our sam-
ple broadcast before the 9 pm watershed contained 78% of
the broadcast alcohol appearances in 1-min intervals.
Actual alcohol use
Actual alcohol use occurred in 419 1-min intervals (2% of
all intervals) across 147 programmes (24% of total pro-
grammes) and 37 advert/trailer periods (3% of total advert/
trailer periods). The highest proportion of alcohol use
involved consumption of beer or cider (177 intervals, 39%
of the total intervals containing alcohol use) followed by
wine or champagne (139 intervals, 31%); spirits (99 intervals,
22%); and cocktails (20 intervals, 4%). There were 16 inter-
vals in which the alcohol type was not clearly identifiable.
Alcohol use occurred in 16/20 genres and was most prom-
inent in Drama (62% of total drama programmes), Soaps
(61%) and Films (57%). The 75% of programming in our
sample broadcast before the 9 pm watershed contained 77%
of the broadcast alcohol appearances. Eight films (57% of
all films coded) contained alcohol use, six of which were
shown pre-watershed. All were classified as suitable for
viewing
by
children
by
the
British
Board
of
Film
Classification (BBFC) (one of them classified as ‘U’ with no
age restriction) (Table S2 in the online Supplementary file 2).
The majority of scenes involving alcohol use featured adults
(404 instances, 96%); there were 18 instances of alcohol use
by people who appeared to be under the age of 18 years.
Implied alcohol use and other alcohol references
Implied alcohol use occurred in 1783 intervals (7% of the
total intervals) and in 669 of all broadcasts (38% of all pro-
grammes/advert/trailer periods combined). Implied use typ-
ically involved holding, but not consuming, an alcoholic
drink (1452 intervals; 69% of other references). Other alco-
hol references, which typically involved the appearance of
beer pumps or glasses, occurred in 2659 1-min intervals
(10% of all intervals) and in 700 programmes and advert/
trailer periods broadcast (40% of all programmes/advert/
trailer periods combined).

 Alcohol brands
Alcohol branding appeared in 727 1-min intervals (3% of all
total intervals), across 111 programmes (18% of all pro-
grammes) and 123 advert/trailer breaks (11% of all advert/
trailer periods). In total, 122 brands were identified, the
most common of which was Heineken, which was shown in
339 intervals (46% of all intervals containing branding).
Some brands were fictitious: for example, ‘The Simpsons’
programme featured Duff beer, Moe et Chandon champagne
and Absolut Krusty vodka. Whilst real alcohol brands (includ-
ing Carling, Strongbow, Jack Daniels and Jim Beam) were
observed in soap operas, the majority of branding observed
in soaps was fictional (Clayton Beer (in Emmerdale); Bramford
Beer (in Eastenders)).
Branding within programmes pre-watershed was found in
511 intervals (3% of pre-watershed intervals) in 95 programmes
(19% of the total pre-watershed programmes). The majority of
branding was in the form of commercial adverts (624 1-min
intervals, 86% of the total branding intervals) followed by brand-
ing on items not used in a scene (62 1-min intervals, 9% of the
total branding intervals), branding on a product used in a scene
(32 intervals, 4% of the total branding intervals) and 26 ‘other’
1-min intervals (4% of the total branding intervals) which
included branding such as verbal mentions.
The most common form of branding within programmes
was sponsorship (484 intervals, 67% of all branding inter-
vals), either of a programme (e.g. Channel 4’s Original
Comedy sponsorship with Fosters40) or through branding dis-
played on billboards during sporting events (such as
Heineken’s sponsorship of the 2015 Rugby World Cup41) fol-
lowed by products used in scene (21 intervals) and products
not
used
in
scene
(57
intervals).
Heineken
branding
accounted for 38% of appearances (Fig. 4), which arose
mostly from the 2015 Rugby World Cup sponsorship, where
Heineken branding was displayed on billboards during the
event, which alone generated 313 pre-watershed appearances.
In total there were 153 advertisement breaks featuring
commercial advertisements containing alcohol branding, 103
of which were broadcast pre-watershed (67% of the total
commercial advertisements containing alcohol branding). In
total, 30 commercial alcohol adverts featuring branding also
contained alcohol use. The most common commercial brand
shown was Fosters, which occurred in 16 1-min intervals (4
pre-watershed). The majority of brand appearances occurred
in programmes rather than commercial advertising (Fig. 4).
Comparison to previous analysis
In comparison to the previous content analysis of UK
broadcast television, the number of intervals containing any
alcohol content increased from 2947 intervals to 3734
intervals, though largely as a result of increases in the num-
ber of intervals containing implied use or other alcohol
references (see Table S3).
Discussion
Main findings of this study
This study demonstrates that alcohol imagery is extremely
common on UK television, occurring in more than half of
all programmes and almost half of all advert/trailer periods
broadcast in peak viewing time, and with similar frequency
both before and after the 9 pm watershed, on the most
popular television channels. While alcohol branding was
uncommon, over 100 brands were identified and some, such
as Heineken, appeared very frequently. The amount of any
alcohol content was slightly higher, primarily as a result of
implied use or other alcohol references, relative to our earlier
analysis of programming from 2010,36 suggesting that UK
prime-time television remains a constant source of exposure
to alcohol imagery for young people. The majority of brand
appearances occurred in programmes rather than commer-
cial advertising, suggesting investigations focussing on alco-
hol advertisements, such as those conducted by OfCom,42
are missing a great deal of alcohol brand content. Of the
brands identified, Heineken, Corona and Fosters combined
accounted for approximately half of all the total branding
identified. However, third most common brand in total,
Fosters, was the most common in adverts/trailers. The most
common brand in total, Heineken, was mostly featured within
actual programmes as a sponsor. Commercial adverts for
alcohol were commonly aired before the 9 pm watershed.
The majority of branding was broadcast in programme
content rather than in advertising, and occurred through the
sponsorship of programmes, such as comedy on Channel 4
(sponsored by Fosters40), or branding featured in coverage of
sports events, such as Heineken, which featured predomin-
antly during the Rugby World Cup footage.41 Advertisements
are regulated by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)
and are expected to conform to the UK Code of British
Advertising (BCAP code). According to the code, alcohol
‘may not be advertised in or adjacent to children’s pro-
grammes or programmes commissioned for, principally direc-
ted at or likely to appeal particularly to audiences below the
age of 18’ (Rule 32.2). Further, advertisements must also not
‘appeal strongly to people under 18, especially by reflecting or
being associated with youth culture or showing adolescent or
juvenile behaviour’ (Rule 19.15.1). However, programmes
popular with or watched by large numbers of young people
are not necessarily made specifically for them. The ASA’s def-
inition of advertising30 also does not include sponsorship of

 programmes or pitch side advertisements at televised sporting
events. Exemption of these programmes from the above con-
straint has the potential to lead to significant exposure among
young people during peak viewing hours, when ~4.5 million
7–14-year olds watch television.29
What is already known on this topic
Initiation of alcohol use at a young age is a strong risk factor
for dependence in later life5 and there is strong evidence
that exposure to advertising or other alcohol imagery in the
media increases subsequent use in adolescents.6–24 Studies in
earlier decades have found that alcohol imagery appeared
frequently in studies of UK television.32–36 The latest con-
tent analysis of UK broadcast TV was conducted in 2010
and found that alcohol content occurred in 40% of pro-
grammes, and was equally frequent both before and after
the 9 pm watershed.36
What this study adds
Alcohol content shown on TV has an effect on the uptake
of alcohol use in young people.6–24 Our analysis shows that
television remains a major source of alcohol exposure to
young people in the UK and is likely to continue to be a
contributor to alcohol uptake by young people,43 with levels
of content slightly higher than observed in our earlier ana-
lysis of programme content from 2010.36 The OfCom 9 pm
watershed, designed to protect children and young people
from potentially harmful imagery,28 is currently not fulfilling
its purpose in relation to commercial advertising and alcohol
branding in programmes. Quantifying AVC content can be
used to impact policy and change depictions in the media.44–46
Tighter scheduling rules from the ASA and OfCom, such as
restricting alcohol content to after the 9 pm watershed, could
prevent children and adolescents being exposed to alcohol con-
tent and advertising.
Limitations of this study
We coded terrestrial channels since the majority of house-
holds have access to these channels and programmes aired
on these channels consistently receive the highest viewing
share in the UK.37 Given the large viewing audience of these
channels, and the fact that the majority of viewing by 4–15-
year olds in the UK occurs in early morning or early evening
(7–9 pm),29 we assumed that children and young adults will
have access to, and be viewing, the five main channels.
However, we acknowledge that it is equally likely that chil-
dren will have access to and view other channels. We chose
to code programmes broadcast between 6 and 10 pm since
programmes shown in this time period are the most viewed
throughout the week. While the current study only explored
UK broadcast TV, the literature suggests links between
exposure to alcohol AVC and subsequent use in studies con-
ducted around the world.6–24
