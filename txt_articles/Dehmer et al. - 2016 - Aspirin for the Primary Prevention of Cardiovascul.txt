Background: Evidence indicates that aspirin is effective for the
primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorec-
tal cancer (CRC) but also increases the risk for gastrointestinal
(GI) and cerebral hemorrhages.
Objective: To assess the net balance of benefits and harms
from routine aspirin use across clinically relevant age, sex, and
CVD risk groups.
Design: Decision analysis using a microsimulation model.
Data Sources: 3 systematic evidence reviews.
Target Population: Men and women aged 40 to 79 years with
a 10-year CVD risk of 20% or less, and no history of CVD and
without elevated risk for GI or cerebral hemorrhages that would
contraindicate aspirin use.
Time Horizon: Lifetime, 20 years, and 10 years.
Perspective: Clinical.
Intervention: Low-dose aspirin (≤100 mg/d).
Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes are length and quality
of life measured in net life-years and quality-adjusted life-years.
Benefits include reduced nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal
ischemic stroke, fatal CVD, CRC incidence, and CRC mortality.
Harms include increased fatal and nonfatal GI bleeding and
hemorrhagic stroke.
Results of Base-Case Analysis: Lifetime net quality-adjusted
life-years are positive for most adults initiating aspirin at ages 40
to 69 years, and life expectancy gains are expected for most men
and women initiating aspirin at ages 40 to 59 years and 60 to 69
years with higher CVD risk. Harms may exceed benefits for per-
sons starting aspirin in their 70s and for many during the first 10
to 20 years of use.
Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results are most sensitive to
the relative risk for hemorrhagic stroke and CVD mortality but
are affected by all relative risk estimates, baseline GI bleeding
incidence and case-fatality rates, and disutilities associated with
aspirin use.
Limitations: Aspirin effects by age are uncertain. Stroke bene-
fits are conservatively estimated. Gastrointestinal bleeding inci-
dence and case-fatality rates account only for age and sex.
Conclusion: Lifetime aspirin use for primary prevention initiated
at younger ages (40 to 69 years) and in persons with higher CVD
risk shows the greatest potential for positive net benefit.

E
vidence for the effectiveness of aspirin in prevent-
ing recurrent complications from heart disease and
stroke (secondary prevention) is strong (1, 2), but evi-
dence for aspirin's net benefit in preventing cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) and cancer, including colorectal
cancer (CRC), in healthy persons (primary prevention)
has been mixed (2–8). Three recent systematic reviews
conducted on behalf of the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) investigated current evidence for
the benefits and harms of aspirin for primary preven-
tion of CVD, on all-cause mortality, for all types of can-
cer, and for CRC (9–14). These reviews reaffirm evi-
dence of aspirin's effectiveness—no longer differing by
sex—in preventing first-time myocardial infarction (MI)
and ischemic stroke and find new evidence indicating
its effectiveness in CRC prevention. However, the up-
dated reviews also reaffirm aspirin's role in increasing
the risk for major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and
hemorrhagic stroke.
The central clinical dilemma in determining the ap-
propriateness of aspirin for the primary prevention of
CVD and CRC is an uncertain relationship between the
benefits and harms of long-term aspirin use. Therefore,
we conducted a decision analysis using simulation
modeling to assess the expected net benefit of aspirin
use for primary prevention across clinically relevant
population groups defined by their age, sex, and un-
derlying CVD risk characteristics. This study was initi-
ated by the USPSTF to support the update (15) of its
recommendations on using aspirin for primary preven-
tion (3, 4).

 model. This annual-cycle microsimulation model was
parameterized to estimate the person-level natural his-
tory of cardiovascular risk factors and the lifetime inci-
dence of CVD events in a cross-section representative
of the U.S. population. A CRC incidence and case-
fatality natural history module was added to our model
for this study. A detailed description of the model, im-
plemented by using Visual Basic 6.0 (Microsoft) and Mi-
crosoft Excel, can be found in the Supplement (avail-
able at www.annals.org).
Target Population
Aspirin for primary prevention was assessed inde-
pendently for men and women across four 10-year age
bands (40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 79 years)
and baseline 10-year CVD risk bands (ranging from 1%
to 20%). Baseline 10-year CVD risk was rounded to the
nearest integer and estimated using the American Col-
lege of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk cal-
culator for the first hard atherosclerotic CVD event (16).
The calculation of CVD risk at baseline is independent
from the event rates predicted by the model. For each
age, sex, and baseline CVD risk band, simulated per-
sons were randomly oversampled from population
characteristics representative of the U.S. population.
For men aged 60 to 79 years and women aged 70 to 79
years, 10-year low-risk bands that are rarely or never
observed in NHANES (National Health and Nutrition
Examination
Survey)
of
the
U.S.
population
were
excluded.
Initial demographic characteristics were drawn
from the U.S. Census (17). Initial body mass index, sys-
tolic blood pressure, high- and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels, and diabetes status were derived
from the 2001 to 2010 NHANES data (18–22). Initial
smoking status was derived from the 2007 National
Health Interview Survey (23) and calibrated to projec-
tions from the Congressional Budget Office (24). All
persons were assumed to be free of CVD and CRC and
to have nonelevated bleeding risk at baseline (defined
by the absence of any factors for which a clinical pro-
vider would deem aspirin unsafe, such as history of GI
or intracranial bleeding or concurrent use of other
medications that increase bleeding risk).
Study Perspective
Analyses were conducted from a clinical perspec-
tive with respect to health outcomes associated with
aspirin use. Costs were not considered.
Time Horizon
The primary time horizon is over a lifetime, which
we defined at the person level as the “age to death or
age 100” in order to fully account for ongoing benefits
and harms (25). Time horizons of 10 and 20 years are
included for their practical relevance.
Choice of Intervention
Findings from the 3 coordinated, companion sys-
tematic evidence reviews were integral to the parame-
ter assumptions and model design in this study (9–14).
The reviews found evidence that daily aspirin use re-
duces the risk for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and 10-
year (and greater) CRC incidence and mortality. Aspirin
also was found to increase the risk for hemorrhagic
stroke and major GI bleeding. The best balance of car-
diovascular benefits and harms was reflected in aspirin
doses of 100 mg/d or less (low dose). Benefits with
respect to CRC incidence were not strongly correlated
with dose or prior CVD status, and therefore higher
aspirin dose and secondary prevention trials were in-
cluded in deriving this parameter. No clear evidence
was found that aspirin changes the relative risk (RR) for
CVD death, fatal GI bleeding, all-cause mortality, or
other types of cancer or that aspirin effects differ by
age or, in contrast to prior USPSTF findings (4, 26), sex.
Evidence reviews also informed baseline levels of GI
bleeding risk and selection of the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association risk calculator
to specify baseline CVD risk in the model (16).
Intervention Effects
Effects from using aspirin for primary prevention
were modeled as RR modifications to the annual prob-
ability of an event. The CVD and bleeding RRs were
derived from 8 trials about low-dose aspirin for primary
prevention (12, 27–34). The effect of aspirin on the RR
for CRC incidence after 10 years of continuous use was
estimated from 3 aspirin trials (13, 35, 36) (Table 1).
Only a few low-dose aspirin trials independently re-
ported ischemic stroke events (9); therefore, we used a
combined stroke measure that included hemorrhagic
stroke events to approximate the effect of aspirin on
ischemic stroke, resulting in a conservative estimate of
ischemic stroke benefits. All non-CRC benefits and
harms with aspirin initiation are assumed to take effect
immediately, and all RRs are assumed to return to 1.00
with aspirin discontinuation. Indirect effects of aspirin
on disease incidence and mortality may arise when the
EDITORS' NOTES
Context
Benefits and harms of routine aspirin use vary among
individuals.
Contribution
This modeling study suggested that lifetime aspirin use
for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
and colorectal cancer (CRC) had potential net benefits
for most men and women who did not have elevated
bleeding risk and initiated aspirin use at ages 40 to 69
years. Overall benefits did not outweigh harms for per-
sons in their 70s with a 10-year CVD risk of 20% or less.
Caution
Estimates of aspirin effects by age were uncertain.
Implication
Middle-aged men and women without elevated risk for
gastrointestinal or cerebral hemorrhage should con-
sider long-term aspirin use to prevent CVD and CRC.

for

events.
Health utilities for outcomes affected by aspirin use
were estimated using literature sources (37–46) (Ap-
pendix Table 1, available at www.annals.org). Living
without a CVD condition or CRC was given a health
utility of 0.872. All other health utility weights were ap-
plied multiplicatively to that baseline. Disutilities from
MI and GI bleeding events were applied only during
the year an event occurred. In the base-case analysis,
no disutility was applied to taking aspirin daily, but 2
alternative scenarios with aspirin disutilities were con-
sidered in sensitivity analyses.
Analysis Design and Outcomes
All analyses compared outcomes of a simulated
population routinely using aspirin for the primary pre-
vention of CVD and CRC with the same population, all
else held equal, not using aspirin for primary preven-
tion (Figure). Primary outcomes are the net difference
in undiscounted life-years and quality-adjusted life-
years (QALYs), but all modeled benefits and harms
were measured. Aspirin was initiated or continued at
contemporary rates for secondary prevention in both
simulation groups. It was discontinued permanently in
both groups after any major GI bleeding or hemor-
rhagic stroke event. Model simulations were indepen-
dently conducted with a 100 000-person sample for
each age, sex, and baseline CVD risk group.
Baseline Event Rates and Model Validation
Baseline rates of CVD events are generated by the
combination of population characteristics at model ini-
tiation, the natural progression of CVD risk factors as
persons age, and the model's risk equations for dis-
ease. Appendix Table 2 (available at www.annals.org)
compares rates of MI and ischemic stroke generated by
the model with corresponding rates observed in
NHANES (18–22) for external validation of our model's
natural history engine. Baseline rates of major GI bleed-
ing in the nonelevated risk population (that is, among
persons for whom aspirin use is not contraindicated)
were estimated by using data from a large Italian
population-based cohort study (47), with adjustments
for the U.S. age and sex distribution (Appendix Table 3,
available at www.annals.org). Case-fatality rates for GI
bleeding, based on patients without complicating co-
morbidities, were derived from a prospective study
conducted in the United Kingdom (48). Baseline CRC
incidence rates used in the model are derived from U.S.
data (49, 50) and reflect contemporary use of screening
technologies, such as colonoscopy, which can prevent
CRC by the identification and removal of cancer
precursors.
Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis
Two sources of uncertainty were considered in this
study: stochastic heterogeneity from the variability in
outcomes experienced by a randomly selected sample
population and parameter uncertainty from the impre-
cision of model parameter estimates (51). Confidence
intervals reflecting stochastic heterogeneity were esti-
mated by bootstrap resampling the simulated popula-
tion for each stratified outcome 100 000 times with re-
placement. Deterministic (1-way) sensitivity analyses of
key parameters were conducted with all other parame-
ters, probabilities, and population characteristics held
equal. Table 1 and Appendix Tables 1 and 3 present
the alternative parameter values used in the determin-
istic analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses can be
found in our prior work (52).
Role of Funding Source
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
provided funding, project oversight, and review for this
study. Four USPSTF members helped to resolve scope
and methodological issues, and 4 peer reviewers pro-
vided feedback on draft findings. Final model results
are the sole responsibility of the authors.
RESULTS
Lifetime Net Benefit
The estimated lifetime net difference in QALYs
from using aspirin for primary prevention is positive for
all sex and baseline CVD risk groups aged 40 to 69
years (range, 7.4 to 107.9 QALYs per 1000 persons)
that we considered (Table 2). In our results, net life-
years are positive for nearly all groups aged 40 to 59
years (range, 3.2 to 82.8 life-years per 1000 persons).
For women aged 50 to 59 years with a 10-year CVD risk
of 1% and both sexes aged 60 to 69 years with a 10-
year CVD risk of 10% or less, net life-years are negative.
Both net QALYs and life-years are negative for men and
women of all considered risk levels aged 70 to 79

Uncertainty in aspirin's effect to reduce CVD mortality risk was in-
cluded among the sensitivity analysis parameters because a plausible,
but not statistically significant, effect was observed in the systematic
review (9, 12). Parameter values for the RR of CVD mortality and hem-
orrhagic stroke were capped at 1.00 to maintain consistency in the
directionality of aspirin benefits and harms. Findings include evidence
on the effect of aspirin in the reduction of CRC incidence derived from
non–low-dose aspirin (>100 mg/d) trial interventions (British Doctor's
Trial and United Kingdom Transient Ischemic trial) (36) and on a CVD
secondary prevention population (United Kingdom Transient Ischemic
Attack trial) (36), but no apparent relationship with dose or prior CVD
status for this effect has been identified (10, 13).

 years. The magnitude of lifetime net life-years and
QALYs is often similar for men and women and is gen-
erally greater the lower the age or the greater the 10-
year CVD risk at initiation.
Detailed benefit and harm outcomes are presented
in Table 3 and Appendix Tables 4 and 5 (available at
www.annals.org). Differences in lifetime net outcomes
between men and women are explained by the differ-
ences in baseline incidence for MI (higher for men),
ischemic stroke (higher for women), and GI bleeding
(higher for men). Women also have a longer life expec-
tancy, which corresponds to a longer average risk ex-
posure during which aspirin can intervene. When com-
paring by age groups, we found that lifetime net CVD
events and prevented CRC cases are at their lowest
when aspirin is initiated at older ages. This corresponds
to the decrease in person-years of risk exposure. In
contrast, lifetime net harms are similar or greater
among older age groups because of increases in base-
line GI bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke risk with age.
Persons with lower CVD risk often have greater ex-
pected reductions in CRC incidence and mortality be-
cause of longer life expectancy. Because of the com-
plex interplay between benefits and harms of aspirin on
the length or quality of life, the sign of net events does
not always correspond with net life-years or net QALYs.
Net Benefit Over 10 and 20 Years
Over 20 years, the predicted net QALYs from aspi-
rin remain positive for most CVD risk groups (men and
women) aged 40 to 69 years (Table 2). However, the
magnitude of net QALYs that is positive over 20 years is
generally a small fraction of the lifetime net benefit
(range, 0.1 to 23.6 QALYs per 1000 persons). In addi-
tion, net life-years are negative for nearly all groups
over this time frame. Over 10 years, net life-years and
QALYs are also negative, or are only marginally posi-
tive, for all groups. No CRC benefit is reflected in the
10-year results because of the delayed effect found in
the systematic evidence review.
Sensitivity Analyses
One-way parameter sensitivity for men and women
with baseline CVD risk of 10% over lifetime, 20-year,
and 10-year horizons are compared in Appendix Ta-
bles 6 to 8 (available at www.annals.org), respectively.
These tables show that the possibility for a direct reduc-
tion in the RR for CVD-related death from aspirin (cases
6 and 7) has the most potential to sway results; net
life-years and QALYs would be positive for nearly all
groups over all time horizons with only a 3% reduction
in CVD mortality risk (case 7). The next most sensitive
parameter to both measures is the RR for hemorrhagic

 stroke (cases 13 and 14). Even a small disutility associ-
ated with taking aspirin routinely (cases 1 and 2) can
dramatically decrease net QALYs. Aspirin's effect on re-
ducing CRC incidence also has a considerable effect;
not accounting for this effect reduces lifetime net
QALYs by about 50% and lifetime net life-years by even
more. Variation in GI bleeding incidence and case-
fatality rates (cases 10 to 12) has a greater relative ef-
fect for persons initiating aspirin in their 60s and 70s.
DISCUSSION
These estimates quantify the expected difference
in benefits and harms from taking low-dose aspirin for
the primary prevention of CVD and CRC by age, sex,
and baseline 10-year CVD risk group as derived from a
detailed microsimulation model. Overall, we find that
aspirin is expected to improve overall quality of life
(that is, reduce illness) for most men and women with-
out elevated bleeding risk when aspirin is initiated at
ages 40 to 69 years for lifetime use, unless otherwise
contraindicated. Such use is also expected to improve
life expectancy for most men and women who start as-
pirin at ages 40 to 59 years and for those at higher CVD
risk who start aspirin at ages 60 to 69 years. Our pri-
mary results do not find overall benefits to outweigh
harms for persons in their 70s with a 10-year CVD risk
of 20% or less. The balance of benefits and harms from
using aspirin over 10 and 20 years is far more tenuous
for most population groups, and several limitations and
considerations should be considered before translating
any of these findings to practice.
This study incorporates important new evidence
that has been published since the last USPSTF reviews
(3, 4). One major difference is in our findings by sex.
Aspirin was previously found to reduce the RR for MI in
men by 32% and the RR for stroke in women by 17%;
the current review finds that aspirin reduces the RR for
MI by 17% and the RR for stroke by 14% (12) in both
men and women. Another major difference is the new
finding of lower risk for CRC after 10 years of aspirin
use. This added benefit can account for more than half
of the lifetime net benefit, in terms of life-years and
QALYs, from routine aspirin use (case 3 in Appendix
Table 6). Of note, the RR for GI bleeding with aspirin
was previously 2.00 compared with 1.58 found in the
updated review. The RR for hemorrhagic stroke was
previously 1.69 compared with the substantially lower
RR of 1.27 used in this study.
We also had many methodological differences (de-
tailed in section 5.1 of the Supplement). The prior net

* The 10-y CVD risk levels are based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk calculator and refer to a person's risk
at model baseline. Risk levels are rounded to the nearest integer. Results reflect the difference between universal adoption of low-dose aspirin
(≤100 mg/d) for primary prevention vs. no adoption. All else is held equal. Boldface values indicate that the CIs reflecting stochastic heterogeneity
do not include 0 per bootstrap sampling with replacement 100 000 times from within the original modeled population sample. Findings include
evidence on the effect of aspirin in the reduction of colorectal cancer incidence derived from non–low-dose aspirin (>100 mg/d) trial interventions
(British Doctor's Trial and United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack trial) (36) and on a CVD secondary prevention population (United Kingdom
Transient Ischemic Attack trial) (36), but no apparent relationship with dose or prior CVD status for this effect has been identified (10, 13).

 benefit calculations were restricted to the first nonfatal
events over 10 years (Table 24 of the Supplement). In
this analysis, we account for fatal and nonfatal events
over a lifetime and provide life-years and QALYs as out-
come measures. Our results reveal that the lifetime ho-
rizon is needed to ensure all important benefits and
harms are captured and that the largest average net
balance of benefits is realized with long-term aspirin
use. Life-years are an important measure because they
incorporate differences in the expected length of life
that may come from increased prevalence of fatal
bleeding episodes, which are balanced against indirect
reductions in CVD or CRC mortality that arise from the
prevention
of
nonfatal
CVD
and
CRC
incidence.
Quality-adjusted life-years are an important measure
because they incorporate both expected length- and
quality-of-life effects, which balance all fatal and nonfa-
tal benefits harms. In addition, the ratio of nonfatal to
fatal events generally decreases with age; therefore, we
find fewer preventable nonfatal MIs and ischemic
strokes in older age groups in our competing risk
framework. Calculations of harms also differ. Our anal-
ysis incorporates estimates of age-adjusted case-fatality
associated with GI bleeding events. This can have a
meaningful effect on net benefit calculations, particu-
larly for men and women initiating aspirin in their 60s
and 70s (case 10 in Appendix Table 6). In addition,
hemorrhagic stroke rates vary by age and CVD risk
groups, which means that both benefits and harms
scale with baseline CVD risk in our analysis. The base-
line hemorrhagic stroke rates generated by our model
compare well with large U.S.-based cohort studies and
are generally much higher than assumed by the 2009
recommendation (Table 25 of the Supplement).

 A recent study (53) used long-term follow-up re-
sults from the Women's Health Study to develop com-
peting risk prediction models to estimate absolute risk
reduction among CVD, cancer, and GI bleeding. De-
spite differences in underlying evidence and methods,
our results over 10 and approximately 15 years are
generally similar (Table 27 of the Supplement). Another
recent study (54) used a population-based incidence
model to estimate the net difference in event rates over
15 years with prophylactic aspirin use in the general
U.K. population. For that which can be compared, find-
ings are generally consistent between studies, with dif-
ferences in net events attributable to differential base-
line event rates between the U.S. and U.K. populations
and by the combined-versus-separated approach to as-
pirin's effect on stroke type (Table 28 of the Supple-
ment). In addition, a cohort modeling study (55) exam-
ined
the
cost-effectiveness
of
aspirin
for
primary
prevention of CVD and CRC in men. Findings are again
generally similar, with differences in net QALYs largely
explained by the inclusion of a disutility to taking aspi-
rin in the study's base-case analysis.
The average effectiveness of aspirin is deter-
mined by randomized trials and may reflect cross-
contamination if participants assigned to the control
group chose to use aspirin or those assigned to the
aspirin group chose not to use aspirin (nonadherence).
It is not known what would be observed with typical
adherence levels and a pure control group. We expect,
however, that the effectiveness of aspirin reflected in
our analysis should correspond with good adherence
because the modeled population mirrors persons will-
ing to participate in a clinical trial. Our findings may not
be relevant to those with lower expected adherence
patterns, especially if they are associated with disutility
for taking aspirin.
The systematic reviews did not find compelling ev-
idence of differential effects by age. It is not clear how
robust the homogenous RR effects are for all popula-
tion groups, particularly persons with low event rates in
the trial populations (such as those in their early 40s).
We extended aspirin effects for persons older than 80
years; however, we did not evaluate aspirin initiation for
these persons (nor for those <40 years) because of lim-
ited representation at enrollment in aspirin trials. Re-
sults from the ongoing ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing
Events in the Elderly) trial (56) may help to fill data gaps
among older populations.
It is widely believed that aspirin reduces the risk for
ischemic stroke but increases the risk for hemorrhagic
stroke. The latter was not found to be statistically signif-
icant in the systematic reviews, but we included this

 harm in our decision analysis because of its biological
plausibility and the limited power to detect differences
in this relatively rare event in study populations. In ad-
dition, our RR estimate for ischemic stroke underesti-
mates benefits because it is derived from combined
stroke data. This conservative approach may be appro-
priate given the imprecision in measuring the increased
risk for hemorrhagic stroke.
By design, both CVD and CRC mortality risk may
be affected indirectly by aspirin use in our model as a
downstream effect of preventing nonfatal CVD events
or CRC incidence, respectively. Low-dose aspirin trials
indicate that there may be a small reduction in CVD
mortality risk, but this finding is not statistically signifi-
cant (12) and we did not include it in our base-case
analysis. In contrast, evidence indicates that the RRs for
CRC incidence and mortality are both reduced with as-
pirin use (13). To avoid double-counting, we modeled
aspirin's effect on CRC incidence only and allowed the
model's natural history of cancer to determine CRC
deaths prevented. Nevertheless, we found that CVD
mortality at 10 years and CRC mortality at 20 years in
our model results align with rates observed in trials (Ta-
ble 29 of the Supplement).
The model accounts for a correlation between risk
for CVD and CRC because of tobacco use. Hemor-
rhagic stroke risk also correlates with overall CVD risk.
We did not, however, establish and incorporate GI
bleeding risk equations that would account for a corre-
lation between GI bleeding and CVD risk factors, such
as tobacco use and diabetes.
These
results
naturally
raise
questions
about
whether there is an optimal age to stop aspirin use;
however, evidence is lacking on the implications of dis-
continuing aspirin after long-term use. It could be mis-
leading to use a model to inform discontinuation deci-
sions without better data to support such analyses.
This analysis approached the decision to use aspi-
rin from the perspective of a person's age, sex, and
10-year risk for CVD. Given the systematic evidence re-
view findings of substantial benefit from aspirin in the
prevention of CRC, persons with an elevated risk for
CRC may consider using aspirin for this benefit alone.
Stratifying net benefits by CRC risk was outside the
scope of this analysis, but the detailed outcomes pre-
sented in Table 3 and Appendix Tables 4 and 5 may be
helpful for those considering aspirin use for that
reason.
These results apply to persons whose aspirin use is
not absolutely contraindicated by a medical provider
for such reasons as a history of GI or intracranial bleed-
ing or concurrent use of medications that increase
bleeding risk, which corresponds with the data we used
to inform community-based bleeding risks (47). We did
not account for heterogeneity in GI bleeding risks be-
yond age and sex. Case-fatality rates for GI bleeding
events are not well-established in the literature. Aspirin
primary prevention trials do not show a difference in GI
bleeding mortality, but this may be due to the rarity of
these events in highly selected trial populations. Our
analysis uses observational GI bleeding mortality data
(48), which indicate a large increase in case-fatality
rates at older ages. Better estimates of how age, sex,
aspirin, and other possible risk factors interact to affect
GI bleeding and case-fatality rates may modify the net
benefit findings, especially among older age groups
(cases 10 to 12 in Appendix Tables 6 to 8).
These
results
indicate
that
several
population
groups may benefit from aspirin for the primary pre-
vention of CVD and CRC. Nevertheless, discretion
should be used when interpreting these results be-
cause sensitivity analyses reveal meaningful uncertainty
about the magnitude of net benefit. Benefit and harm
calculations are most sensitive to uncertainty about the
effect of low-dose aspirin on the increased risk for hem-
orrhagic stroke and in the primary prevention of CVD
mortality. Moreover, parameter estimates used in this
study may not be reliable for populations underrepre-
sented in the aspirin primary prevention trials. A better
understanding of the effects of aspirin by age group
and after discontinuation, additional studies that report
aspirin's effect on ischemic stroke separately from hem-
orrhagic stroke, and the development of comprehen-
sive risk equations for GI bleeding would increase con-
fidence in and precision of the simulation results.
Quality-of-life benefits from using aspirin may be con-
siderably diminished among persons who dislike taking
routine medications. Future research may identify addi-
tional benefits (such as protective effects against other
types of cancer) or harms that may substantially alter
these
findings.
These
sources
of
uncertainty
and
patient preferences should be carefully considered in
the shared decision-making process about the routine
use of aspirin for primary prevention.

CRC = colorectal cancer; CVD = cardiovascular disease; GI = gastro-

* All health utility weights are applied multiplicatively to the baseline
health utility weight. The quality-of-life reduction for CRC is applied for
≤5 y in the case of nonfatal episodes. Quality-of-life reductions for
congestive heart failure are included as major sequelae to MI. First-
year/new-event health utility weights are applied during the year of an
incident event or first year of disease onset; ongoing health utilities
are applied in subsequent years.

* This table compares CVD prevalence at various ages between
NHANES 2001–2010 (18–22) combined data and results from the
ModelHealth: CVD model. The model run represented here is based
on a birth cohort (starting at age 40 y) with hypertension screening
and treatment, cholesterol screening and treatment, and aspirin for
primary and secondary prevention—all implemented and adopted at
contemporary rates. For comparison purposes of the cross-sectional
and longitudinal data sets, outcomes are calculated for the age range
from NHANES and the midpoint of the age range from the Model-
Health: CVD output; this methodological difference can explain some
small discrepancies.

* Baseline GI bleeding risks are the probabilities of developing GI
bleeding without aspirin by age and sex. GI bleeding case fatalities
represent the probability of dying from GI bleeding by age. The other
parameter values are used in 1-way sensitivity analyses and are in-
tended to reflect analytically meaningful alternative values for these
parameters rather than statistical uncertainty.

CRC = colorectal cancer; CVD = cardiovascular disease; GI = gastrointestinal; MI = myocardial infarction; QALY = quality-adjusted life-year.
* The 10-y CVD risk levels are based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk calculator and refer to a person's risk at model baseline. Results reflect the difference
between universal adoption of low-dose aspirin (≤100 mg/d) for primary prevention vs. no adoption. All else is held equal. Findings include evidence on the effect of aspirin in the reduction of
CRC incidence derived from non–low-dose aspirin (>100 mg/d) trial interventions (British Doctor's Trial and United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack trial) (36) and on a CVD secondary
prevention population (United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack trial) (36), but no apparent relationship with dose or prior CVD status for this effect has been identified (10, 13).
† Nonfatal.
‡ Includes nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, and congestive heart failure (as major sequelae to MI).
§ Includes fatal and nonfatal events.
�� Defined by the net of benefit and harm events or this equation: (nonfatal CVD events + CVD deaths + CRC cases) − (GI bleeding events + hemorrhagic strokes).

ASA = acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin); CRC = colorectal cancer; CVD = cardiovascular disease; GIB = gastrointestinal bleeding; HS = hemorrhagic stroke; IS = ischemic stroke; LY = life-year; MI =
myocardial infarction; QALY = quality-adjusted life-year; RR = relative risk.
* Results reflect the difference (sensitivity) in lifetime net outcomes compared with the base-case analysis, averaged across all age, sex, and baseline CVD groups. Each numbered item represents
a 1-way sensitivity analysis with the parameter changed as described. Case 4 CRC benefit = none is equivalent to setting the CRC RR = 1. Case 10 GIB death = none is equivalent to setting the
case-fatality rates from GI bleeding to 0%. Case 12 GIB incidence rate = double is equivalent to doubling the baseline probabilities of GI bleeding. See Table 1 and Appendix Tables 1 and 3 for
additional detail. Findings include evidence on the effect of aspirin in the reduction of CRC incidence derived from non–low-dose aspirin (>100 mg/d) trial interventions (British Doctor's Trial and
United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack trial) (36) and on a CVD secondary prevention population (United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack trial) (36), but no apparent relationship with dose
or prior CVD status for this effect has been identified (10, 13). Outcome sensitivity is proportionally similar for groups with other 10-y CVD risk thresholds.

ASA = acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin); CRC = colorectal cancer; CVD = cardiovascular disease; GIB = gastrointestinal bleeding; HS = hemorrhagic stroke; IS = ischemic stroke; LY = life-year;
MI = myocardial infarction; QALY = quality-adjusted life-year; RR = relative risk.
* Results reflect the difference (sensitivity) in 20-y net outcomes compared with the base-case analysis, averaged across all age, sex, and baseline CVD groups. Each numbered item represents a
1-way sensitivity analysis with the parameter changed as described. Case 4 CRC benefit = none is equivalent to setting the CRC RR = 1. Case 10 GIB death = none is equivalent to setting the
case-fatality rates from GI bleeding to 0%. Case 12 GIB incidence rate = double is equivalent to doubling the baseline probabilities of GI bleeding. See Table 1 and Appendix Tables 1 and 3 for
additional detail. Findings include evidence on the effect of aspirin in the reduction of CRC incidence derived from non–low-dose aspirin (>100 mg/d) trial interventions (British Doctor's Trial and
United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack trial) (36) and on a CVD secondary prevention population (United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack trial) (36), but no apparent relationship with dose
or prior CVD status for this effect has been identified (10, 13). Outcome sensitivity is proportionally similar for groups with other 10-y CVD risk thresholds.
