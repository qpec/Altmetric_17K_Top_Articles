CONTEXT: Legalization of medical marijuana in many states has led to a widening gap between 
the accessibility and the evidence for cannabinoids as a medical treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review published reports to identify the evidence base of 
cannabinoids as a medical treatment in children and adolescents.
DATA SOURCES: Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guidelines, a search of PubMed, Medline, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature databases was conducted in May 2017.
STUDY SELECTION: Searching identified 2743 citations, and 103 full texts were reviewed.
DATA EXTRACTION: Searching identified 21 articles that met inclusion criteria, including 22 
studies with a total sample of 795 participants. Five randomized controlled trials, 5 
retrospective chart reviews, 5 case reports, 4 open-label trials, 2 parent surveys, and 1 case 
series were identified.
RESULTS: Evidence for benefit was strongest for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, 
with increasing evidence of benefit for epilepsy. At this time, there is insufficient evidence 
to support use for spasticity, neuropathic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and Tourette 
syndrome.
LIMITATIONS: The methodological quality of studies varied, with the majority of studies lacking 
control groups, limited by small sample size, and not designed to test for the statistical 
significance of outcome measures. Studies were heterogeneous in the cannabinoid 
composition and dosage and lacked long-term follow-up to identify potential adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional research is needed to evaluate the potential role of medical 
cannabinoids in children and adolescents, especially given increasing accessibility from 
state legalization and potential psychiatric and neurocognitive adverse effects identified 
from studies of recreational cannabis use.

 Cannabis is a plant that produces 
pharmacologically active 
cannabinoids, of which the 
constituents cannabidiol (CBD) and 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the 
most studied.1 CBD may function via 
a variety of mechanisms, including 
indirect antagonism and potentiation 
of cannabinoid receptors, whereas 
THC acts primarily as a partial 
agonist to cannabinoid receptors.
Within the THC class of cannabinoids, 
δ-9-THC is the primary form found 
in cannabis, whereas δ-8-THC is 
prepared by cyclization and has less 
psychotropic potency.
Currently, there are 2 synthesized 
cannabinoids that the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has approved 
as medications in the United 
States, dronabinol and nabilone, 
both of which mimic δ-9-THC. 
These 2 medications are the only 
current cannabinoids available by 
physician prescription. For pediatric 
populations, dronabinol dosage for 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and 
vomiting (CINV) is the same as for 
adults. However, dronabinol use for 
AIDS-related anorexia as approved 
in adults is not recommended 
in children because of a lack of 
pediatric studies, with further 
caution recommended because of 
psychoactive effects.2 Similarly, 
the use of nabilone is cautioned 
in pediatric patients because of 
psychoactive effects and a lack of 
established safety and effectiveness.3
On the other hand, naturally derived 
products from cannabis include 
marijuana (dried leaves and flowers 
that are most commonly smoked) 
and oral cannabinoid extracts, 
and such products have varying 
concentrations of cannabinoids 
(eg, CBD and THC) depending on 
the strain of the plant. There are 
also 2 plant-derived cannabinoid 
medications with standardized 
THC and CBD content currently 
undergoing FDA-regulated clinical 
trials, nabiximols and a CBD oral 
solution (See Table 1 for a summary 
of cannabis products).
Because of state legalization of 
medical marijuana, the medical 
use of naturally derived products 
from cannabis, including marijuana 
and oral cannabinoid extracts, is 
now legal in more than half of US 
states via physician certification. 
All states with operational medical 
marijuana programs allow use by 
minors but require consent from 
a legal guardian and certification 
from a physician.4 Certain states 
require the consenting guardian 
to control the acquisition, dosage, 
and frequency of use (ie, AK, AZ, 
HI, ME, MI, NH, NM, NY, OR, RI, and 
Washington, DC). Additionally, some 
states require a second physician 
for the certification of a minor’s use 
(ie, CT, CO, DE, FL, IL, MA, ME, MI, 
MT, NH, and NJ), including 4 states 
that require specific certification 
from a pediatrician (ie, MA and NH), 
pediatric subspecialist (ie, DE), or 
pediatrician and psychiatrist (ie, NJ).
The legalization of medical marijuana 
has led to a widening gap between its 
accessibility and the limited evidence 
base for medical cannabinoids as a 
treatment of pediatric populations. 
Currently, the American Academy 
of Pediatrics opposes dispensing 
medical cannabis to children and 
adolescents outside the regulatory 
process of the US FDA, although 
the Academy does recognize that 
cannabis may currently be an option 
for cannabinoid administration for

current therapies are inadequate.5 
The purpose of this review is to 
systematically examine the current 
evidence for using cannabinoids as 
a medical treatment in children and 
adolescents.
METhODs
A systematic review of the literature 
on medical cannabinoids in children 
and adolescents was performed 
according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews  
and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) 
statement.6 Medline, PubMed, and 
the Cumulative Index to Nursing 
and Allied Health Literature were 
searched for studies published  
from 1948 to 2017 and indexed by 
May 2017 by using the following 
medical subject heading terms and 
keywords (listed alphabetically): 
“cannabinoids, 
” “cannabis, 
” “CBD, 
” 
“δ-8-THC, 
” “dronabinol, 
” “marijuana, 
”  
“marijuana smoking/therapy, 
” 
“marijuana smoking/therapeutic use, 
”  
“medical marijuana, 
” “nabilone, 
” 
and “THC-CBD combination.” Each 
was cross-referenced with child, 
adolescent, or pediatric keywords 
(see Fig 1 for a sample search strategy 
with Boolean search parameters).
Given the preliminary stage of 
research in this area, only minimal 
exclusion criteria were used. Studies 
were included if they were primary 
research that reported original data, 
examined the benefits of cannabis for 
a clinical indication (ie, all medical 
disorders), in English, and comprised 
of a child and adolescent patient 
sample. Studies were excluded if the 
majority of the sample was older 
than 18 years or if age and/or data 
for children and adolescents were not 
reported separately.
One independent reviewer (S.S.W.) 
assessed study eligibility by 
screening the titles, abstracts, and 
full-text articles in a standardized 
manner. Both investigators for final 
inclusion then reviewed the resulting 
full-text articles, with summarized 
information focusing on details such 
as clinical indication, cannabinoid 
type, sample characteristics, 
methodological design, and outcome. 
For cases in which primary outcomes 
were not specified, only the most 
frequently reported outcome was 
reported.
REsuLTs
Medline, PubMed, and the Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature searches yielded 2743 
citations. After adjusting for 
duplicates (n = 132), 2611 citations 
remained. Of these, 2508 were 
excluded, with the most common 
reasons for exclusion being an article 
without information about clinical 
use (n = 1832), an article without 
original data (n = 574), an article not 
relating to cannabis (n = 78), and an 
article not available in English  
(n = 24). The remaining 103 citations 
were assessed for eligibility by 
reviewing the full-text articles, and 
82 were excluded because of the 
majority of the sample being older 
than 18 years or the data for children 
and adolescents were not reported 
separately. A total of 21 articles 
describing 22 studies were identified 
for final inclusion. A flow diagram is 
provided in Fig 2.
study Characteristics
The 21 articles identified dated from 
1979 to 2017, with 14 of the studies 
published within the last 5 years. Five 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 
5 retrospective chart reviews, 5 
case reports, 4 open-label trials, 2 
parent surveys, and 1 case series 
were identified. The total number of 
participants across all studies was 
795. Of the 5 medical conditions 
studied, the most common indication 
was for seizures (n = 11) and CINV

Medical Cannabinoids for CINV
There have been 6 studies of 
cannabinoids for the treatment of 
CINV in children and adolescents. 
Dalzell et al10 showed that nabilone 
decreased nausea severity and 
frequency of vomiting in comparison 
with domperidone in a double-blind, 
crossover RCT of 23 children. Over 
a 5-day cycle of chemotherapy, 
patients treated with nabilone 
had an average of 6 episodes of 
emesis in comparison with 17 
episodes of emesis among patients 
given domperidone. Nabilone also 
reduced nausea severity rated as 
1.5 on a 5-point scale in comparison 
with a 2.5 severity rating in the 
domperidone treatment group. In a 
subsequent double-blind, cross-RCT 
of 30 children, Chan et al9 reported

 nabilone improved retching and 
emesis by 70% compared with 30% 
with prochloperazine. Over a cycle of 
chemotherapy, patients experienced 
13 episodes of retching or emesis in 
comparison with 27 episodes when 
given prochloperazine. In an article 
reporting on 2 double-blind RCTs, 
Ekert et al11 showed that δ-9-THC 
reduced nausea and vomiting in 
comparison with metoclopramide as 
well as prochloperazine.
In an open-label trial, Abrahamov 
et al8 reported that δ-8-THC 
prevented vomiting during 480 
cycles of chemotherapy among 8 
children when given 2 hours before 
chemotherapy and repeated every 6 
hours. In a more recent retrospective 
chart review of 95 children, Elder and 
Knoderer7 reported that dronabinol 
treatment given a median of 3 times 
over the course of chemotherapy 
led to a positive response in 60% 
of children (0–1 bouts of emesis). 
Notably, 95% of patients received 
lower dosing than was guideline 
referred (5 mg/m2), with the most 
common dose given being 2.5 mg/
m2 every 6 hours as needed. Two-
thirds of patients received repeated 
courses, and 62% received outpatient 
prescriptions, suggesting good 
tolerability of the medication.
Medical Cannabinoids for Epilepsy
There have been 11 studies of 
medical cannabinoids for the 
treatment of seizures in children 
and adolescents. In a recent RCT, 
Devinsky et al12 found that CBD 
significantly reduced convulsive 
seizure frequency in children with 
treatment-resistant epilepsy in 
Dravet syndrome as compared with a 
placebo. Among 61 participants who 
received CBD, the median frequency 
of monthly convulsive seizures 
decreased from 12.4 seizures per 
month to 5.9 seizures per month, as 
compared with a decrease of 14.9 
to 14.1 in the placebo group. This 
represented an adjusted reduction 
in median seizure frequency by 
22.9% with CBD in comparison 
with a placebo. Fifteen percent of 
those in the CBD group discontinued 
treatment before the 14 weeks as 
compared with 5% of those in the 
placebo group.
In a previous open-label trial, 
Devinsky et al16 reported that 
CBD reduced seizure frequency 
in a pediatric population with 
childhood-onset treatment-resistant 
epilepsies from a range of different 
causes. In the efficacy analysis of 
137 completers over the 12-week 
treatment period, CBD led to a 
clinically relevant reduction in 
seizures with a median decrease 
in monthly motor seizures of 37%, 
from a baseline median of 30 motor 
seizures monthly to 16 motor 
seizures monthly. There was a low 
rate of patient discontinuation of CBD 
because of poor efficacy (3%). CBD 
also had acceptable tolerability, with 
only 3% of patients discontinuing 
treatment because of an adverse 
event. Notably, 24% of enrolled 
patients were not included in the 
safety analysis because of <12 weeks 
of treatment or follow-up.
In a small open-label case series of 
CBD for patients with treatment-
refractory epilepsy in Sturge-Weber 
syndrome, Kaplan et al14 reported 
that seizures were reduced in 3 of 
the 5 patients. In a similar open-
label case series of CBD for patients 
diagnosed with febrile infection-
related epilepsy syndrome, Gofshteyn 
et al13 reported that seizures were 
reduced in 6 of the 7 patients.
In a retrospective chart review of 
119 pediatric patients with epilepsy, 
Treat et al15 reported oral cannabis 
extracts improved seizures in 49% of 
the cohort, with 24% of the patients 
considered responders as defined by 
a >50% reduction in seizure burden. 
In a second retrospective chart 
review from the same institution, 
Press et al19 found that oral cannabis 
extracts reduced seizures in 57% 
of the 75 patients with treatment-
refractory seizures. Tzadok et al17

Medical Cannabinoids for spasticity
In a retrospective chart review 
of 12 children, Kuhlen et al25 
described the effects of dronabinol 
for treatment-refractory spasticity 
related to developmental disorders 
at a palliative care setting. 
Dronabinol solution given twice 
daily reduced spasticity and was 
continued for a median of 181 days 
with no habituation observed. In 
a case report, Lorenz26 reported 
that dronabinol reduced spasticity 
and myoclonus in a toddler with a 
neurodegenerative disease called 
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.
Medical Cannabinoids for Other 
Indications
In a case report of 2 adolescents 
with neuropathic pain and comorbid 
major depressive disorder, Rudich 
et al23 reported that dronabinol 
reduced the affective component 
of pain by 40% and improved 
psychosocial functioning after 4 
months, although there was a gradual 
dissipation of effectiveness after 6 
months that led to discontinuation. 
Shannon and Opila-Lehman24 reported 
that CBD improved anxiety and sleep in 
a case report of a 10-year-old girl with 
PTSD from early childhood trauma. 
Hasan et al27 reported that δ-9-THC 
decreased tic severity and improved 
quality of life in a case report of a 
16-year-old patient with treatment-
refractory Tourette syndrome.
DIsCussION
This systematic review based on 
PRISMA guidelines identified 22 
studies that evaluated the therapeutic 
benefits of medical cannabinoids 
in 795 children and adolescents, 
although 2 sets of studies (ie, 2 
retrospective chart reviews and 
2 parent surveys) may have had 
overlap in their sample groups. The 
study methods were heterogeneous, 
with only a minority of studies 
designed and powered for efficacy 
analysis (6 of 22). Of the double-blind 
RCTs (n = 5), all reported statistically 
significant postintervention 
reductions in the primary outcomes 
of CINV (n = 4) and convulsive 
seizures (n = 1). An open-label trial 
for treatment-refractory epilepsy 
also reported statistically and 
clinically significant postintervention 
reductions in seizure frequency, 
although the lack of a blinded control 
group limits the strength of the 
conclusion. Although the remaining 
reports suggested that cannabinoids 
were associated with improvements 
in CINV (n = 2), seizures (n = 9), 
spasticity (n = 2), tics (n = 1), PTSD 
(n = 1), and neuropathic pain (n = 1), 
the publications were not designed 
to evaluate the statistical significance 
of outcomes. In comparison with 
the paucity of pediatric studies 
on medical cannabinoids, the 
adult literature is relatively more 
substantive. Therefore, to facilitate 
an interpretation of the findings of 
this review, the identified pediatric 
studies are interpreted in context of a 
larger adult literature.
CINV
Although several of the RCTs 
investigating CINV date back to the 
1980s, there is quality evidence that 
cannabinoids are effective as an 
antiemetic in children undergoing 
chemotherapy. Of note, all 6 studies 
used a THC cannabinoid, including 
δ-8-THC, δ-9-THC, dronabinol, and 
nabilone. The studies demonstrate 
that THC is more efficacious than 
antiemetics such as prochloperazine, 
metoclopramide, and domperidone, 
although side effects of drowsiness 
and dizziness were common. 
This evidence parallels the adult 
literature. In a Cochrane review 
of 23 adult trials, Smith et al28 
reported that cannabinoids are more 
efficacious than a placebo and are 
similar to conventional antiemetics in 
the treatment of CINV.
Epilepsy
The research in cannabinoids as 
a seizure treatment in children 
has grown rapidly over the past 
decade, with the number of studies 
investigating it as an antiepileptic 
equaling the number of studies for all 
other pediatric conditions combined. 
The 11 studies suggest cannabinoids 
may have a therapeutic benefit for 
seizures from different etiologies, 
including treatment-refractory 
epilepsy as studied in 8 of the studies. 
CBD is the cannabinoid that appears 
to have more evidence for efficacy as 
used in 8 of the 11 studies, including 
the only RCT and all 3 prospective 
open-label studies. However, most 
studies lacked a placebo control 
group, and the resulting potential 
for regression to the mean greatly 
reduces the strength of conclusions. 
Furthermore, the 2 survey studies 
recruited parents from online 
forums and a parent interest group, 
both of which are at high risk of 
sampling bias. In contrast to other 
diagnoses, the pediatric literature on 
cannabinoids for epilepsy informs 
the adult literature in this area, not 
vice versa.

 spasticity
Researchers in 2 studies, which 
are at high risk of bias because 
of a lack of controls and blinding, 
examined dronabinol for the 
treatment of spasticity in children 
with developmental disabilities. This 
evidence, albeit limited, parallels 
the adult literature. In summarizing 
2 systematic reviews and an 
additional RCT of adult patients, 
the National Academy of Sciences29 
concluded there was substantial 
evidence that oral cannabinoids 
benefit patient-reported spasticity 
symptoms, although the evidence 
is primarily from populations with 
multiple sclerosis. Nabiximols, 
an oromucosal spray containing 
an ∼1:1 ratio of THC to CBD, is a 
medication approved in Canada and 
multiple European countries for 
the treatment of adult patients with 
spasticity from multiple sclerosis 
and remains in phase 3 of FDA trials 
in the United States.
Neuropathic Pain
Reseachers in only 1 case report of 
2 adolescents that lacked controls 
and blinding examined dronabinol 
for treatment of neuropathic pain; 
therefore, conclusions are limited. 
However, these preliminary 
findings tentatively align with 
findings in the adult literature. A 
systematic review by Whiting et al30 
identified 28 RCTs of adults with 
chronic pain, of which 17 trials 
were related to a neuropathy; 
the resulting analysis suggested 
that cannabinoids lead to greater 
improvement in pain. In addition, 
Andreae et al31 conducted a 
subsequent systematic review of 
inhaled cannabis for peripheral 
neuropathy, which demonstrated 
pain relief with a possible dose-
dependent effect.
PTsD
Researchers in only 1 case report 
at high risk of bias given a lack of 
controls and blinding have examined 
CBD for the treatment of PTSD; 
therefore, conclusions are also 
limited. The limited adult literature 
is conflicting in regard to the 
association between cannabinoids 
and PTSD. In the only RCT, Jetly et al32 
reported that nabilone improved 
nightmares, global clinical state, 
and general well-being compared 
with a placebo in a crossover design. 
However, this single study contrasts 
with nonrandomized literature 
that shows limited evidence of 
an association between cannabis 
use and increased PTSD symptom 
severity.31, 
 
33
Tourette syndrome
Researchers in only 1 case report 
at high risk of bias given a lack of 
controls and blinding investigated 
the benefits of δ-9-THC in Tourette 
syndrome. In this case study, THC 
was associated with a reduction in 
tic severity. In the adult literature, 
2 small controlled trials suggested 
a benefit of THC on tic severity in 
Tourette syndrome, although the 
reports are at similarly high risk of 
bias given the lack of an adequate 
description of randomization, 
allocation concealment, and 
incomplete outcome data.34, 
 
35
Limitations
The literature on medical 
cannabinoids in children and 
adolescents is constrained by several 
important limitations, including 
between-study heterogeneity in 
the studied cannabinoid form and 
dosage (ie, CBD and THC content), 
indication, and ages of the sample. 
The sample sizes in many studies 
were small, with 13 of the 22 studies 
containing <20 participants. Notably, 
17 of the 22 studies lacked a control 
group, and 16 of the 22 studies were 
not designed to test the statistical 
significance of changes in outcome 
measures. Finally, most studies 
lacked long-term follow-up to test 
for potential adverse neurocognitive 
and psychiatric side effects that have 
been demonstrated in recreational 
cannabis studies.
Risks of Cannabinoids
Although there is evidence for 
potential benefits in pediatric 
populations, pediatricians, 
families, and patients must balance 
the decision to use medical 
cannabinoids with the associated 
risks. In controlled trials, THC 
most commonly led to side effects 
of drowsiness and dizziness, with 
severity associated with higher 
doses. However, no major side 
effects were reported with dose 
reduction. The most common side 
effects with CBD were somnolence, 
diarrhea, and decreased appetite. In 
the controlled trial, although 75% of 
patients receiving CBD experienced 
side effects, only 13% withdrew 
from the trial because of the side 
effects. This parallels a systematic 
review of adult side effects from 
medical cannabinoids, which found 
dizziness and somnolence as the 
most commonly reported adverse 
events, followed by muscle spasm, 
pain, and dry mouth; notably, there 
was no evidence of a higher incidence 
of serious adverse events.36 Of note, 
accidental overdose of cannabis 
has been associated with multiple 
adverse effects, including reports of 
seizures among toddlers, which may 
be because of the toxicity of high-
dose THC.37
The paucity of the studies limits our 
understanding of long-term risks 
associated with medical cannabinoids 
in pediatric populations. In the 
absence of substantive quality 
data from literature on medical 
cannabinoids, we highlight the 
findings of harms from recreational 
cannabis literature. There are 
important differences between 
recreational and medical cannabinoid 
use, including frequency, dosing, 
and potency, as well as significant 
confounds in the recreational use 
population, such as comorbid 
substance use and psychiatric

the findings from the recreational 
cannabis literature to medical 
cannabinoids remains uncertain, 
pediatricians and families should 
understand the potential risks 
because it directly informs the 
decision for medical cannabinoid 
treatment.

endocannabinoid system, 
undergoes active development 
during adolescence,

confer increased vulnerability to 
adverse long-term outcomes from 
cannabinoid use before adulthood.

are particularly concentrated in 
brain regions that are critical for 
executive functioning, reward 
processing, and memory, including 
the prefrontal cortex, anterior 
cingulate cortex, basal ganglia, 
hippocampus, amygdala, and 
cerebellum.39 Neuroimaging 
studies show that individuals who 
begin using cannabis regularly in 
adolescence tend to have differences 
in cortical and subcortical volumes, 
white matter integrity, and 
functional connectivity compared 
with nonusers.40 The structural and 
functional neuroimaging differences 
appeared to correlate with cognitive 
impairments, such as attention 
deficits associated with right-
hippocampus activation, 
41 verbal 
memory deficits associated with 
frontoparietal circuitry, 
42 and poorer 
executive functioning associated with 
prefrontal cortex volume.43
In a large, prospective study, long-
term cannabis use in adolescents was 
associated with lower-than-expected 
IQ scores at follow-up, 
44 although 
this finding is confounded by familial 
environment, genetic liability, and 
sociodemographic factors, such as 
school dropout.45, 
 
46 Studies have 
demonstrated a dose-response 
relationship between cannabis 
use (ie, frequency, quantity, and 
duration) and cognitive impairments, 
including deficits in verbal learning 
and memory, 
47 psychomotor 
performance, 
48 and attention.49 
Converging lines of evidence showed 
that the onset of cannabis use before 
age 16 years, compared with later 
onset, is associated with poorer 
attention, 
50 executive functioning, 
51 
memory performance, 
47 and verbal 
IQ.52
Notably, recreational cannabis users 
in controlled settings have shown 
a preference for certain types of 
medical cannabinoids, including 
dronabinol and high-dose nabiximol, 
in comparison with a placebo, 
suggesting an abuse liability in 
at-risk populations.53 Long-term 
recreational use of cannabis is 
associated with risk of cannabis use 
disorder, which is characterized by 
impaired control over cannabis use 
and difficulty in ceasing use despite 
its harms. An estimated 8.9% of 
cannabis users escalate use to meet 
cannabis use disorder criteria.54 For 
those who initiate use in adolescence, 
the risk of cannabis use disorder rises 
to 1 in 6, 
55 with peak risk appearing 
at ∼17 years of age.56 Furthermore, 
twin studies reported that adolescent 
cannabis users have an elevated risk 
of developing other substance use 
disorders.57
One study has reported that 
recreational, frequent cannabis 
use during adolescence before age 
15 years has been associated with 
an increased risk of depression.58 
However, subsequent longitudinal 
studies reported contradicting 
results, 
59 with baseline depression 
associated with future initiation 
of cannabis use and suggesting 
confounds, such as sociodemographic 
factors and comorbidities, that  
limit conclusions regarding  
simple causality. Twin studies 
showed early-onset cannabis 
use and depression likely reflect 
shared genetic and environmental 
vulnerabilities.60 Adolescent  
cannabis use, particularly earlier 
onset and regular use, has also been 
associated with later suicidality.60, 
61  
Cannabis use in early adolescence 
is further linked to earlier onset of 
psychotic disorders among at-risk 
populations.62 Adolescents who use 
cannabis regularly subsequently 
reported higher levels of subclinical 
psychotic symptoms, such as 
paranoia and hallucinations, and 
the effect persisted despite 1 year of 
abstinence.63
A review of prospective 
longitudinal studies reported 
that early cannabis use increases 
risk of poor school performance, 
particularly leaving school early.64 
Adolescent cannabis use is also 
linked to externalizing problems, 
such as delinquent and aggressive 
behavior.65 Finally, increasing 
levels of cannabis use before age 
21 years was associated with 
higher unemployment and welfare 
dependence and lower levels of 
income and relationship and life 
satisfaction by age 25 years.66
CONCLusIONs
This review raises an important 
methodological issue in the field. 
Although we found a larger number 
(n = 2743) of citations that invoked 
terms related to cannabinoids 
in children and adolescents, 
we identified only 22 studies 
that examined cannabinoids for 
clinical indications in the pediatric 
population. Under the Controlled 
Substances Act of 1970, cannabis 
remains a Schedule I drug, and 
restrictive regulations continue 
to limit the research of medical 
cannabinoids. Concurrently, 
medical cannabinoids are becoming 
increasingly available to populations 
because of state legalization, of 
which cannabis plant products that 
are available in dispensaries may 
have highly variable cannabinoid 
concentrations. Finally, potential 
neurocognitive and psychiatric 
harms have been identified in the 
recreational cannabis literature. 
In this context, pediatricians,

Downloaded from 
 families, patients, and policy makers 
continue to lack urgently needed 
information to make balanced 
decisions regarding the use of 
medical cannabinoids in children 
and adolescents.
In summary, the objective of this 
systematic review was to synthesize 
the current state of the research on 
medical cannabinoids in children 
and adolescents. Beyond studies 
of CINV and epilepsy, the findings 
provided limited evidence of 
variable quality supporting the 
use of cannabinoids for different 
clinical indications. Additional 
larger, prospective, and controlled 
studies are required to better 
delineate the medical utility of 
cannabinoids in different pediatric 
disorders. This body of evidence has 
important implications in identifying 
the risks and benefits of medical 
cannabinoids in children and 
adolescents, especially in the context 
of psychiatric and neurocognitive 
adverse effects that have been 
identified from pediatric studies of 
recreational cannabis use.
