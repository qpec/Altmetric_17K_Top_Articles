OBJECTIVES: Respiratory pathogens commonly trigger pediatric asthma exacerbations, but 
their impact on severity and treatment response remains unclear.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of the Determinants of Oral Corticosteroid 
Responsiveness in Wheezing Asthmatic Youth (DOORWAY) study, a prospective cohort 
study of children (aged 1–17 years) presenting to the emergency department with moderate 
or severe exacerbations. Nasopharyngeal specimens were analyzed by RT-PCR for 27 
respiratory pathogens. We investigated the association between pathogens and both 
exacerbation severity (assessed with the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure) and 
treatment failure (hospital admission, emergency department stay >8 hours, or relapse) of 
a standardized severity-specific treatment. Logistic multivariate regressions were used to 
estimate average marginal effects (absolute risks and risk differences [RD]).
RESULTS: Of 958 participants, 61.7% were positive for ≥1 pathogen (rhinovirus was the most 
prevalent [29.4%]) and 16.9% experienced treatment failure. The presence of any pathogen 
was not associated with higher baseline severity but with a higher risk of treatment failure 
(20.7% vs 12.5%; RD = 8.2% [95% confidence interval: 3.3% to 13.1%]) compared to 
the absence of a pathogen. Nonrhinovirus pathogens were associated with an increased 
absolute risk (RD) of treatment failure by 13.1% (95% confidence interval: 6.4% to 19.8%), 
specifically, by 8.8% for respiratory syncytial virus, 24.9% for influenza, and 34.1% for 
parainfluenza.
CONCLUSIONS: Although respiratory pathogens were not associated with higher severity on 
presentation, they were associated with increased treatment failure risk, particularly in 
the presence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and parainfluenza. This supports 
influenza prevention in asthmatic children, consideration of pathogen identification on 
presentation, and exploration of treatment intensification for infected patients at higher 
risk of treatment failure.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Viruses trigger the majority of asthma 
exacerbations in children; however, there is a lack of adequately powered 
high-quality studies that provide conclusive evidence on pathogen-specific 
determinants on clinical relevant outcomes of asthma exacerbation.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In children with moderate/severe exacerbations, 
viral detection is not associated with greater severity on presentation; 
however, the presence of specific pathogens, namely respiratory syncytial 
virus, influenza, and parainfluenza, identified children with worse 
outcomes and presenting with insufficient response to standardized 
corticosteroids and bronchodilator treatment.

 Exacerbations constitute the largest 
burden of disease in children with 
asthma, with 60% to 80% being 
triggered by respiratory pathogens.1 
The use of reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
has facilitated our understanding 
of the epidemiology of respiratory 
pathogens in this population, 
2 with 
a growing interest in rhinovirus, 
the most frequently identified 
virus during exacerbations.1 
Some reports have suggested an 
association between rhinovirus C 
and severe asthma exacerbations 
and hospitalizations.3, 
4 Recently, 
enterovirus D68 has also been 
reported in outbreaks of severe 
respiratory complications in 
children with asthma.5 However, 
influenza’s role in exacerbation 
severity and health care use 
remains controversial.6 In addition, 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 
parainfluenza virus (PIV), and other 
pathogens, including atypical bacteria 
(such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae), 
have been associated with 
exacerbations, 
7 but only researchers 
of a limited number of studies have 
investigated the impact of specific 
pathogens on severity, 
4 and none 
have primarily addressed treatment 
response.
Emergency department (ED) 
management with inhaled 
bronchodilators and systemic 
corticosteroids8, 
 
9 for moderate or 
severe asthma exacerbations has 
been shown to reduce the risk of 
hospitalization.10 Ducharme et al11 
investigated the determinants of 
treatment failure in children with 
moderate or severe exacerbations 
presenting to the ED in the 
Determinants of Oral Corticosteroid 
Responsiveness in Wheezing 
Asthmatic Youth (DOORWAY) study, 
the largest cohort of its kind. The 
detection of a respiratory virus 
was associated with treatment 
failure. However, pathogen-specific 
effects were not investigated. 
Quantifying the impact of specific 
respiratory pathogens may (1) guide 
infection prevention interventions 
in children with asthma, (2) focus 
efforts on pathogen diagnosis at 
ED presentation, and (3) identify 
children at higher risk of treatment 
failure in whom treatment 
intensification may be considered.
In children presenting to the ED 
with a moderate or severe asthma 
exacerbation, our aims were to 
ascertain the association between the 
presence of a laboratory-confirmed 
specific respiratory pathogen and 
both the baseline exacerbation 
severity and the risk of ED treatment 
failure.
METHODS
This study is an ancillary study in 
which we explore specific infectious 
etiologies of the DOORWAY primary 
objective11 and is a multicenter 
prospective ethics-approved cohort 
study of children with moderate 
or severe asthma exacerbation 
presenting to 1 of 5 EDs of the 
Pediatric Emergency Research 
Canada network between 2011 and 
2013. Briefly, the original study 
authors’ objective was to identify 
determinants of ED management 
failure after standardized therapy. 
Children were eligible if they 
were 1 to 17 years of age, had a 
physician diagnosis of asthma 
based on a previous episode with 
airflow obstruction with response 
to asthma medication, ≥3 wheezing 
episodes (if <2 years of age), 
12, 
 
13 or 
previous diagnostic lung function 
test results and a physician diagnosis 
of moderate or severe exacerbation 
using the validated 12-point pediatric 
respiratory asthma measure (PRAM) 
score14 on ED presentation. An 
independent committee adjudicated 
cases with diagnostic uncertainty. 
Patients were excluded if there 
was suspicion of bronchiolitis or 
foreign body aspiration, another 
chronic respiratory disorder, 
or a contraindication to study 
medication treatment. All children 
received a standardized dose of oral 
corticosteroids (2 mg/kg [1 mg/kg in 
1 site] of prednisone or prednisolone, 
or 0.3 mg/kg of dexamethasone) 
and bronchodilator treatment with 
salbutamol, and those with severe 
exacerbations additionally received 
ipratropium bromide. All eligible 
DOORWAY participants with a valid 
respiratory specimen were included 
in this study.
Exposure: Respiratory Specimen 
Testing
A nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab 
(flocked swab; Copan Diagnostics, 
Murrieta, CA) was systematically 
procured within 1 hour of study 
inclusion, placed in 3 mL of viral 
transport media (Universal Transport 
Medium; Copan Diagnostics), and 
frozen at −80°C. Adenovirus (B, C, 
and D), coronavirus (229E, HKU1, 
NL63, and OC43), enterovirus (A, B, C, 
and D), influenza (A and B), PIV (1, 2, 
3, and 4), human metapneumovirus 
(hMPV) (A and B), RSV (A and B), 
and rhinovirus (A and B) were 
investigated by using a validated 
multiplex RT-PCR microarray 
hybridization assay.15 Nucleic acids 
from respiratory specimens were 
also tested by using a commercial 
multiplex polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) assay16 to identify 
the atypical bacteria M pneumoniae, 
Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and 
Bordetella pertussis.
All specimens that tested positive in 
the enterovirus and/or rhinovirus 
probe on the microarray assay15 
but were negative for type-specific 
enterovirus or rhinovirus (n = 302) 
and those that tested negative 
in the enterovirus or rhinovirus 
probe but were positive for 1 of 
the enterovirus– or rhinovirus 
type–specific probes (n = 20) were 
further tested by using RT-PCR 
and sequencing17 in which we 
targeted the 5′ untranslated region 
of rhinovirus A, B, and C and some 
enteroviruses, including enterovirus

 D68 (GenBank accession numbers: 
MF978769 to MF979073). For 
samples with undetermined results 
by additional testing (n = 16), results 
from the original microarray analysis 
were used. Results were interpreted 
blinded to the clinical outcome. 
Exposure variables were as follows: 
specimens that tested positive for 
either a virus or atypical bacteria 
were coded as “pathogen-positive.” 
Coinfection was defined as the 
presence of ≥2 pathogens compared 
to a single pathogen and no pathogen.
Outcome Measures
The PRAM score on presentation 
was used to determine the 
baseline exacerbation severity and 
was analyzed alternatively as a 
continuous variable and as a binary 
variable; a PRAM score of 4 to 7 
indicated moderate exacerbation, 
and 8 to 12 indicated severe 
exacerbation.14 ED management 
failure, which was also the primary 
composite outcome in the DOORWAY 
study, 
11 was defined as hospital 
admission for asthma, treatment 
in the ED lasting 8 hours or more 
after corticosteroid administration, 
or return to the ED within 72 hours 
of discharge leading to hospital 
admission or prolonged ED stay.
Data Analysis
The prevalence of each respiratory 
pathogen was described by using 
frequency counts and proportions. 
Pathogens with <10 positive 
cases were aggregated. Covariates 
identified in the literature were 
explored as potential confounders, 
mediators, and interaction terms. 
A detailed description of covariates 
can be found in the primary study.11 
Briefly, covariates included in 
the models were age in years 
(continuous), sex, child atopy 
(based on parental report of a 
diagnosis or symptoms of allergic 
rhinitis and eczema as documented 
by the International Study of 
Asthma and Allergies in Childhood 
questionnaire), 
18 asthma phenotype 
(intermittent or persistent), oral 
corticosteroid use in the preceding 
12 months as a marker of morbidity, 
asthma control (measured with the 
6-point Asthma Quiz for Kidz), 
19 
asthma controller use (daily, only 
when sick, or none), season (based 
on the calendar), upper respiratory 
tract infection (URTI) at index visit 
(clinical diagnosis), fever (at ED 
presentation), pneumonia (physician 
diagnosis based on clinical signs with 
chest radiograph), tobacco exposure 
(categorical variable based on saliva 
cotinine levels sampled after study 
inclusion), average family income 
quantile (based on postal code census 
data as a proxy for socioeconomic 
characteristics), and study site.
Potential interactions between 
exposures and atopy, allergic rhinitis, 
income, and the possible mediators 
(fever, pneumonia, and URTI) were 
assessed on the additive scale. Linear 
and logistic regressions were used 
to investigate the association with 
exacerbation severity by using the 
baseline PRAM as a continuous or 
dichotomous outcome, respectively, 
and logistic regression for association 
with treatment failure. This resulted 
in 1 model in which the exposure 
was any pathogen versus no 
pathogen, 1 model for rhinovirus-
positive versus non–rhinovirus-
positive versus pathogen-negative, 
8 models for each specific pathogen 
exposure (rhinovirus A, B, and C; 
RSV; influenza; hMPV; PIV; and 
enterovirus D68 as the categorical 
variable versus “any other pathogen–
positive” versus pathogen-negative) 
in which pathogen-negative was used 
as the reference, and 1 final model 
used to compare coinfection (>1 
pathogen) versus single pathogen.
Results of regression models are 
presented as predicted probabilities 
of the outcome (absolute risks [ARs] 
and risk differences [RDs] with their 
95% confidence intervals [CIs]) and 
represent the average marginal effect 
across the total study population.20 
– 
22 
Patients with missing data for 
variables included in these models 
were excluded from the analysis. 
Model fit was assessed with the area 
under the curve for logistic (and with 
R-squared for linear) regression. No 
correction for multiple testing was 
applied.23 Analyses were performed 
by using Stata 13 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX) and R version 3.2.1 
(www. 
r- 
project. 
org).
RESULTS
Of 1012 participants enrolled in 
the DOORWAY study, 958 children 
were included in our assessment 
of association with exacerbation 
severity, and 924 had ED treatment 
failure (Fig 1).
Distribution of Respiratory 
Pathogens: Patient and Exacerbation 
Characteristics
Of the 958 respiratory specimens 
tested, 591 (61.7%) were positive 
for ≥1 pathogen, with coinfection 
present in 81 specimens (8.5%); 
RSV and coronavirus were the most 
frequent copathogens (n = 13). 
The most prevalent pathogen was 
rhinovirus (n = 282; 29.4%), and 
rhinovirus C was the most frequent 
species (n = 174; 18.2%), followed by 
RSV (n = 171; 17.9%). M pneumoniae 
was identified in only 2 patients 
(Table 1).
Compared to those without, children 
with a laboratory-confirmed 
pathogen were younger (median 
[interquartile range (IQR)] age: 2 
[1–5] vs 4 [2–7] years), had higher 
tobacco exposure (cotinine levels ≥4 
ng/mL in 6.8% vs 3.8%), and were 
slightly more likely to present with 
fever (29.4% vs 24.2%). Compared 
to children who were not rhinovirus-
positive, children with rhinovirus 
were less often febrile (16.2% vs 
41.2%) and less frequently diagnosed 
with pneumonia (5.0% vs 15.9%; 
 
Table 2). The seasonal distribution of 
specific respiratory viruses differed 
markedly (Fig 2).

 Association Between Pathogen 
and Exacerbation Severity on 
Presentation
The proportion of children presenting 
with a severe exacerbation was 33.3% 
(95% CI: 30.3% to 36.3%). By using 
the initial triage PRAM score as a 
binary outcome (moderate versus 
severe exacerbation), no positive 
association was found between the 
presence of any pathogen and severe 
versus moderate exacerbation. 
The adjusted AR of a severe 
exacerbation was 32.4% (95% CI: 
29.0% to 35.8%) in the presence 
of a pathogen and 38.3% (95% CI: 
33.6% to 43.0%) in the absence of 
a pathogen, representing an RD of 
−5.8% (95% CI: −11.8 to 0.01; Fig 3A, 
Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental 
Fig 5). Although the risk of severe 
exacerbation in rhinovirus-positive 
children was similar to that in those 
with no pathogen, the presence 
of a nonrhinovirus pathogen was 
associated with a 12.9 percentage 
point–lower (95% CI: −19.5% to 
−6.3%) adjusted risk of severe 
exacerbation compared with no 
pathogen. The presence of hMPV and 
PIV were associated with a lower 
risk of severe asthma with adjusted 
RDs (95% CI) of −13.6% (−23.0% 
to −4.3%) and −31.7% (−44.5% to 
−18.9%), respectively. No statistically 
significant association was found 
between severity and RSV, influenza, 
enterovirus D68, adenovirus, and 
coronavirus (Fig 3B, Supplemental 
Table 3, Supplemental Fig 5). The 
pathogen-specific risk did not change 
when stratifying for coinfection. 
The association between exposure 
and severity was also investigated 
by using the PRAM score as a 
continuous outcome and repeating the 
exposure models; they confirmed the 
conclusion of all results using PRAM 
as a dichotomous outcome.
Association Between Pathogen and 
Treatment Failure
Overall, 156 of 924 participants 
(16.9%; 95% CI: 14.5% to 19.3%) 
experienced treatment failure. The 
presence of any respiratory pathogen 
(AR = 20.7%; 95% CI: 17.4% to 
24.1%) compared to no pathogen 
(AR = 12.5%; 95% CI: 9.0% to 16.0%) 
was associated with an increased 
risk of treatment failure (RD = 8.2%; 
95% CI: 3.3% to 13.1%; Fig 4A, 
Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental 
Fig 6). Although the presence of 
rhinovirus and its species was not 
associated with treatment failure, 
there was a higher risk of failure 
in children with a nonrhinovirus 
infection (AR = 25.4%; 95% CI: 
19.8% to 31.0%) compared to those 
with no pathogen present, resulting 
in an adjusted RD of 13.1% (95% CI: 
6.4% to 19.8%).
More specifically, RSV, influenza, and 
PIV were associated with a higher 
risk of treatment failure: 21.4% (95% 
CI: 14.1% to 28.7%), 37.5% (95% CI: 
17.8% to 57.2%), and 46.7% (95% 
CI: 20.4% to 73.0%), respectively. 
This resulted in AR increases of 
8.8% (95% CI: 0.4% to 17.2%), 
24.9% (95% CI: 4.7% to 45.1%), and 
34.1% (95% CI: 7.5% to 60.7%; Fig 
4B), respectively. hMPV had an RD 
of 8.0% (95% CI: −1.6% to 17.6%). 
Coronavirus, adenovirus, enterovirus 
D68, and the presence of a 
coinfection were not associated with 
an increased risk of failure (Fig 4B, 
Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental 
Fig 6). Pathogen-specific risk did 
not change when stratifying for the 
presence of a coinfection.
DISCUSSION
In this large cohort, approximately 
two-thirds of children presenting 
to the ED with moderate or severe 
asthma exacerbation had a positive 
respiratory specimen result for 
1 or more respiratory viruses or, 
rarely, atypical bacteria. No positive 
association was found between 
the presence of any pathogen 
and exacerbation severity on 
presentation. In fact, some viruses 
were associated with a significantly 
lower severity. Despite standardized

 therapy with corticosteroids 
and severity-specific inhaled 
bronchodilators, the presence of 
any respiratory pathogen (and more 
specifically, of a nonrhinovirus 
pathogen) was associated with more 
treatment failure compared with 
noninfected counterparts. Severity 
on presentation and response to 
treatment thus appear as 2 distinct 
dimensions of the impact of viral 
infections in children with acute 
asthma.
The high prevalence of rhinovirus 
C in children presenting with 
asthma exacerbation, its presumed 
association with asthma-related 
hospitalization, and its peak in the 
fall have brought this virus to the 
forefront as a potential cause for 
more severe disease.4 We confirmed 
its high prevalence but were unable 
to confirm an increased severity 
or greater treatment failure in 
rhinovirus- or rhinovirus C–infected 
children. Perhaps rhinovirus plays a 
role in the initiation of exacerbations 
that are severe enough to warrant 
health care contact, but once infected, 
response to treatment appears 
favorable. This is in line with a 
subgroup analysis of a randomized 
controlled trial of children treated 
with corticosteroids in which those 
with rhinovirus responded better 
to steroid treatment than those 
who tested negative for entero/
rhinovirus.24
In contrast, the presence of 
nonrhinovirus pathogens as a group, 
and particularly hMPV and PIV, was 
associated with a larger proportion of 
children presenting with a moderate, 
rather than severe, exacerbation; 
however, nonrhinovirus pathogens 
were significantly linked to higher 
treatment failure, particularly 
with RSV, influenza, and PIV, even 
after adjustment for patient and 
exacerbation characteristics. Indeed, 
in this group of children aged at least 
1 year in whom bronchiolitis was 
specifically excluded, we observed a 
significant association between RSV 
and increased treatment failure by 
an absolute 8%. This observation is 
in line with a small study in which 
researchers documented a lower 
response to steroids in children with 
asthma who were infected with RSV 
compared to those who were not 
infected.25 It is also congruent with 
substantive literature on the lack 
of response to corticosteroids and 
bronchodilators in children with RSV 
bronchiolitis, 
26, 
 
27 which raises the 
possibility that RSV per se confers 
treatment resistance irrespective of 
disease and not only in infants aged 
<1 year with wheezing.28 The third 
most frequent organism, hMPV, was 
associated with a risk of treatment 
failure similar to that of RSV, but its RD

 did not reach statistical significance. 
Although involved in recent outbreaks 
of severe respiratory infections, 
5 
enterovirus D68 was not associated 
with more severe exacerbations or 
excess treatment failure in our cohort 
perhaps because of differences in 
subtypes related to the more recent 
outbreaks. Although previously 
associated with severe infection and 
lower respiratory tract symptoms 
in patients with asthma, 
29 our few 
cases of PIV 3 specifically and PIV in 
general were insufficient to firmly 
conclude on the effect on severity. 
Finally, the few children who tested 
positive for influenza or PIV (n = 24 
and n =14, respectively) had a striking 
≥20% AR of treatment failure than 
pathogen-negative patients. Although 
this may explain the reported excess 
hospitalizations for cardiopulmonary 
disease in children with asthma that 
is associated with influenza, 
30 asthma 
was not identified as a risk factor for 
influenza-related hospitalization in 
a large meta-analysis.6 Nevertheless, 
response to therapy is significantly 
reduced with RSV, influenza, and PIV.
Only a limited number of patients 
were found positive for atypical 
bacteria, compared to previous 
studies.7 The use of nasopharyngeal 
or nasal swabs instead of throat 
swabs might have accounted for 
the lower sensitivity of our tests.31 
Moreover, there was no association 
between coinfection and less 
favorable outcomes perhaps because 
the species is more important than 
the number of pathogens.
What are the implications of these 
findings? Perhaps treatment 
intensification with inhaled 
anticholinergics or magnesium sulfate, 
both of which reduce acetylcholine 
release at the myoneural junction, 
could block the vagal-mediated 
reflex bronchoconstriction observed 
in viral-induced exacerbation.32 
These therapies that are currently 
reserved for severe exacerbations 
may be tested for their efficacy in 
exacerbations of any severity triggered

 by RSV, influenza, and PIV, which 
have been associated with poor 
treatment response. Although the 
mechanism of action remains to be 
clarified, azithromycin, 
33 which has 
been shown effective in preschoolers 
with previously severe exacerbations, 
could be explored as an alternative 
pathogen-nonspecific therapy to 
target antineutrophilic inflammation. 
Clearly, any pathogen-specific antiviral 
and/or treatment intensification first 
requires an identification of pathogens 
associated with each exacerbation; 
this would imply real-time diagnostic 
test in the ED by using RT-PCR or 
a wider introduction of point-of-
care testing. Until then, preventive 
measures should be prioritized. This 
is particularly important in light of 
the growing knowledge that early-
life RSV and rhinovirus infections 
are also associated with an increased 
risk of inception of asthma34 and, 
for the former, poorer ED treatment 
response. Children with asthma should 
remain a priority group for influenza 
immunization because of the newly 
established association between 
influenza and ED management failure 
combined with well-recognized 
influenza-related complications. 
Although this recommendation has 
been challenged by a 2013 Cochrane 
review, in which researchers failed to 
find clear evidence that immunization 
reduced the occurrence and severity 
of influenza-associated asthma, Cates 
et al35 underlined the paucity of 
efficacy trials contributing data to their 
meta-analysis. Given the documented 
safety of influenza immunization 
in children with asthma and its 
expected protective effect, it appears 
reasonable to pursue strategies to 
improve immunization coverage for 
influenza and invest in efforts for the 
development of vaccines for RSV and 
rhinovirus.
We acknowledge the following 
limitations. Although our study 
is the largest cohort of its kind, 
with a richness of data that made 
it possible to adjust for important 
patient characteristics, children 
presenting with a mild exacerbation 
were excluded, thus limiting 
our ability to identify a potential 
differential impact of pathogens on 
the full range of asthma exacerbation 
severity. Although we tested for

 27 respiratory (including new) 
pathogens, microorganisms identified 
by PCR could have included both 
nonreplicating viruses and colonizing 
microorganisms. Thus, we cannot 
rule out that some episodes may 
not have been triggered by the 
identified respiratory pathogen. Such 
misclassification may lead to some 
inaccuracies; however, it should 
be nondifferential and would have 
biased our results toward the null. 
Yet, because most parents reported 
that the index episode was triggered 
by a URTI, it is more likely than not 
that the identified microorganism was 
associated with symptoms. Because 
atopy was assessed by parental report 
and their recall of allergy testing, with 
no systematic testing with serum-
specific immunoglobulin E or allergy 
testing, our ability to investigate 
the interaction between pathogen 
and atopy as observed in some 
studies36 was suboptimal. Moreover, 
recent exposure to allergens37 was 
not documented. Finally, the use of 
anticholinergics was severity-specific, 
and because it differed between 
children with moderate and severe 
exacerbations, it may have interacted 
with some viruses to improve 
treatment response and reduce our 
ability to identify poor responders.
CONCLUSIONS
In children presenting to the ED 
with a moderate or severe asthma 
exacerbation, no virus, including 
the most prevalent organism 
(rhinovirus C), was associated 
with higher exacerbation severity. 
In fact, nonrhinovirus pathogens 
were associated with less severe 
exacerbations but with more ED 
treatment failure; RSV, influenza, 
and PIV increased by 8% to 
34% the AR of treatment failure. 
Interventions for RSV prevention and 
influenza immunization thus need 
to be revisited. The efficacy of both 
pathogen-specific and nonspecific 
therapies should be further explored 
to decrease the risk of treatment 
failure in children with acute 
asthma by using advanced and rapid 
pathogen identification in the ED to 
enable their implementation.
