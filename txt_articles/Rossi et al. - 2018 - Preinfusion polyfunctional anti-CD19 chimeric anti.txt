After treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, interleukin-15 (IL-15) ele-
vation and CAR T-cell expansion are associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) out-
comes. However, the association of preinfusion CAR product T-cell functionality with
clinical outcomes has not been reported. A single-cell analysis of the preinfusion CD19 CAR
product from patients with NHL demonstrated that CAR products contain polyfunctional
T-cell subsets capable of deploying multiple immune programs represented by cytokines
and chemokines, including interferon-g, IL-17A, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory pro-
tein 1a. A prespecified T-cell polyfunctionality strength index (PSI) applied to preinfusion
CAR product was significantly associated with clinical response, and PSI combined with
CAR T-cell expansion or pretreatment serum IL-15 levels conferred additional significance.
Within the total product cell population, associations with clinical outcomes were greater
with polyfunctional CD41 T cells compared with CD81 cells. Grade ‡3 cytokine release
syndrome was associated with polyfunctional T cells, and both grade ‡3 neurologic toxicity
and antitumor efficacy were associated with polyfunctional IL-17A–producing T cells. The findings in this exploratory
study show that a preinfusion CAR product T-cell subset with a definable polyfunctional profile has a major association
with clinical outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00924326.

Introduction
Genetic reprograming of T cells to express a chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) offers a novel approach for treating hemato-
logic malignancies.1-3 T cells transduced with an anti-CD19
CAR composed of CD28 and CD3z signaling domains produce
interferon-g (IFN-g) in a CD19-specific manner, kill primary
leukemia cells, and undergo CD19 target–dependent pro-
liferation.4 Treatment of B-cell malignancies with anti-CD19
CAR T cells results in durable remission in a significant number
of patients. This treatment is associated with B-cell aplasia
because of endogenous CD19 expression on B cells. Additionally,
treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy can cause cy-
tokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity (NT).
Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy has not yet been fully char-
acterized mechanistically.5,6 An optimized, low-dose condi-
tioning chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide and
fludarabine has been shown to enhance engraftment of CAR
T cells through lymphodepletion and by increasing serum
cytokine levels, most notably interleukin-15 (IL-15).6 Levels of
IL-15 are correlated with CAR T-cell expansion, which in turn
correlates with clinical response and toxicities.6 This study also
showed that greater expansion of CAR T cells in blood and
higher serum levels of IL-15, granzyme B, and IL-10 were asso-
ciated with grade $3 NT.6
T cells deploy a broad spectrum of immune programs,7 and it
is unclear which specifically influence in vivo expansion and
activity of CAR T cells. We hypothesized that CAR T cells or-
chestrate clinical activity by deploying multiple immune pro-
grams that functionally complement one another. To address
this hypothesis, we evaluated CAR T-cell product functionality
using a high-content single-cell multiplex cytokine analysis8,9
that allowed for identification of a subset of polyfunctional
T cells in CAR T-cell products that produce $2 cytokines upon
stimulation with CD19 antigen in vitro. We also examined
associations of a prespecified polyfunctionality strength index
(PSI) applied to CAR T-cell products, CAR T-cell expansion in
vivo, objective response (OR), and toxicities. We show that

 highly polyfunctional T cells within CAR T-cell products are
significantly associated with clinical response and that a subset
of polyfunctional CD41 T cells producing IL-17A is associated
with grade $3 NT.
Methods
Patient demographics and treatment protocol
The study cohort comprised 22 patients with recently described
clinical outcomes.6 Of 22 treated patients, 19 had diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 2 had follicular lymphoma, and 1 had
mantle cell lymphoma (Table 1). Of 19 patients with DLBCL,
11 had chemotherapy-refractory lymphoma. Five patients with
DLBCL had lymphoma that relapsed #10 months after autol-
ogous stem-cell transplantation as their last treatment before
protocol enrollment. Eleven patients with DLBCL were high risk,
according to the second-line, age-adjusted International Prognostic
Index.10 The median number of unique lymphoma therapies
received before protocol enrollment was 4 (range, 1-7). Products
from 20 patients were evaluable by single-cell multiplex cytokine
profiling and used in this exploratory study (Table 1). OR is defined
as partial or complete response according to Cheson et al11 2014
criteria. Stable and progressive disease correspond to lack of OR
(nonresponders). CRS and NT were graded as previously reported.6
T-cell polyfunctionality evaluation by single-cell
cytokine profiling and calculation of PSI
Cryopreserved CAR T-cell products comprising ;40% to 60%
CAR1 T cells, measured by surface expression of the single-chain
variable fragment by flow cytometry, were thawed and cultured
in complete Cell Therapy Systems (Thermo Fisher Cell Therapy
Systems, Waltham, MA) medium with IL-2 (10 ng/mL; Biolegend,
San Diego, CA) at a density of 1 3 106/mL in a 37°C, 5% CO2
incubator. After overnight recovery, viable T cells were enriched
using Ficoll-Paque Plus medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA). CD41/CD81 T-cell subsets were separated using anti-CD4
or anti-CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) and stimulated with K562 cells transduced with ei-
ther CD19 or nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) at a ratio of
1:2 for 20 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. The cocultured CD41 or
CD81 T cells were further enriched using anti-CD19– or anti-
NGFR–conjugated magnetic beads to deplete CD19-K562 or
NGFR-K562 cells. Presence of CD41 or CD81 CAR T cells was
confirmed by staining with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Cell Therapy
Systems) at room temperature for 10 minutes, rinsing once with
phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspending in complete
Cell Therapy Systems medium at a density of 1 3 106/mL. Ap-
proximately 30 mL of the cell suspension was loaded onto the
single-cell barcode chip (SCBC) microchip9 for single-cell
secretomic evaluation.
For each sample, a 32-plex assay measured secreted proteins
from ;2000 T cells (Figure 1). Raw microscopy and microarray
scans of the cell samples (loaded onto the SCBC) and protein
secretion data were analyzed using proprietary image processing
software to determine the locations of chambers containing sin-
gle cells and subsequent extraction of their secretion readouts.
Data from empty cell chambers were used to measure back-
ground intensity levels for each analyzed protein. Single-cell read-
outs were then normalized using the background readouts to
determine significant secretions and compare profiles across
assays. Proprietary software and the R statistical package (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) were used
for statistical data analysis and visualizations.
A single-cell functional profile was determined for each evaluable
product. Profiles were categorized into effector (granzyme B,
IFN-g, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1a, perforin, tumor
necrosis factor [TNF]-a, TNF-b), stimulatory (granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-2, IL-5, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9,
IL-12, IL-15, IL-21), regulatory (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IL-22, TGF-b1,
sCD137, sCD40L), chemoattractive (CCL-11, IP-10, MIP-1b,
RANTES), and inflammatory (IL-1B, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, MCP-1,
MCP-4) groups. Polyfunctional product CAR T cells were defined
as cells cosecreting at least 2 proteins from the prespecified
panel per cell coupled with the amount of each protein produced
(ie, combination of the number of proteins secreted and degree of
intensity). Cutoffs for any given cytokine were computed based on
background levels from wells not containing cells plus 3 standard
deviations. Knowing the functional profile of each cell enables
the calculation of other metrics, including a breakdown of each sam-
ple according to cell polyfunctionality (ie, percentage of cells se-
creting multiple cytokines vs nonsecreting or monofunctional cells)
and a breakdown of the sample by functional groups (ie, mono- and
polyfunctional groups secreted by cells in the sample and level
of frequency).
Furthermore, the PSI of each sample was computed using a
prespecified formula,8 defined as the percentage of polyfunctional
cells, multiplied by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the
proteins secreted by those cells: PSIsample 5 (% polyfunctional cells
in sample) +32
i 5 1 MFI of secreted protein i of the polyfunctional
cells.
The CD41 and CD81 PSIs were computed for corresponding
CD19-K562 or NGFR-K562 stimulated samples from each donor.
An overall PSI, (the average of CD41 and CD81 PSIs), was also
computed.
The CD41 PSI calculation was performed by analyzing all poly-
functional CD41 cell readouts of the sample. Each readout was an
n dimensional vector (n 5 number of analyzed cytokines) of signal
intensities (MFI, random fluorescence intensity). The average
signal intensity of each cytokine was found across the set of
polyfunctional cells. Multiplying this number by the fraction
of polyfunctional cells provided the individual cytokine PSI values
(eg, IL-17A CD41 PSI). The sum of all the individual cytokine
PSI values provided the overall CD41 PSI for the sample. The
same calculation was performed to find the CD81 PSI and the
individual CD81 PSI of each cytokine. Averaging CD41 and CD81
PSIs provided the overall PSI for each sample. We also calculated
a monofunctional strength index, defined as the percentage of
monofunctional cells multiplied by the secretion intensity of that
cytokine.
Any notable statistically significant associations between pre-
infusion single-cell CAR T data and clinical outcome were deter-
mined, cognizant of the clinical outcome of these patients (OR,
CRS, and NT). More specifically, associations between overall PSI,
CD41 PSI, CD81 PSI, IL-17A CD41 PSI, and clinical outcomes
were determined. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to deter-
mine P values of these associations. Any associations between

 single-cell metrics (eg, PSI) and other pre- and postinfusion
metrics described throughout this report (eg, in vivo CAR T-cell
expansion, IL-15 day 0 patient levels, coculture and serum cytokine
levels, T-cell phenotype frequencies) were determined by mea-
suring the Spearman correlation between these metrics.
In some cases, 2 metrics were combined into a joint metric to
test their association with patient outcome. The metrics were
added to each other after each was first standardized to have unit
variance. This standardization was achieved by dividing the
metrics by their respective standard deviation to bring them
to a common magnitude/scale. Therefore, when added to each
other, the metrics carry a similar weight, and neither overpowers
the other.
Measurement of in vivo CAR T-cell levels
CAR T-cell presence and expansion in blood were measured
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously
described.5
Measurement of cytokines in coculture and serum
by multiplex analysis
Coculture experiments were performed using K562 cells
engineered to express CD19 or NGFR (negative control) mixed
1:1 with CAR T-cell product. Cell culture medium was harvested
24 hours postincubation for subsequent analysis. Thirty-one
analytes were evaluated by Meso Scale Discovery (Rockville, MD),
MULTI-SPOT, and EMD Millipore (Burlington, MA) Luminex
xMAP multiplex assays. Serum IL-15 was measured using EMD
Millipore Luminex xMAP multiplex assays. Data acquisition and
analysis were performed using a Luminex 200 instrument and
xPONENT 3.1 data analysis software.
Evaluation of percentage of T17 and T regulatory
cells by epigenetic analysis
Epigenetic analysis was performed based on previously char-
acterized methods,12 at Epiontis GmbH (Berlin, Germany). Genomic
DNA was isolated using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen) following

 the protocol for cultured animal cells. Bisulfite treatment of
genomic DNA was performed. PCR was performed in a final
volume of 25 mL containing 13 PCR buffer, 1 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Qiagen), 200 mmol/L of 29-deoxynucleoside
59-triphosphate, 12.5 pmol each of forward and reverse
primers, and 7 ng of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA at 95°C
for 15 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 1 minute, 55°C for
45 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, and a final extension step
of 10 minutes at 72°C. The PCR products were purified using
ExoSAP-IT (USB Corp, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by
applying the PCR primers and the ABI Big Dye Terminator
version 1.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems) followed by cap-
illary electrophoresis on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer; epigenetic
sequencing methylation analysis software was used to interpret
AB1 files.
Determination of product T-cell phenotypes by
flow cytometry
For CD4, CD8, and central memory phenotype determination,
we used a method similar to that described previously.5 CAR1
CD31 events were gated, and the percentage of cells expressing
memory markers CCR7 and CD45RA was determined. Appro-
priate isotype control antibodies were used in all experiments.
The memory antibodies used were anti-CD45RA (eBioscience,
San Diego, CA; clone HI100) and anti-CCR7 (R&D Systems; clone
150503).

From 
 Gene expression analysis
Gene expression analysis was performed at NanoString Tech-
nologies (Seattle, WA). Cryopreserved cells were thawed and
enumerated using a Vi-CELL automated cell counter (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA). Live cell suspensions were used as input into
the NanoString Vantage 3D RNA:Protein Immune Cell Profiling
Panel (NanoString Technologies), a 770-plex gene and 30-plex
protein expression panel that profiles the human immune re-
sponse. For CD19-K562 or NGFR-K562 samples, 50 000 cells
were used for RNA and 100 000 cells for protein. For K562
plus CAR T-cell cocultures, 150 000 cells were used for RNA and
200 000 cells for protein. For CAR T cells, 300 000 cells were used
for RNA and 200 000 cells for protein. A custom gene expression
panel of 191 additional immune- and metabolic-related markers,
including probes specific for the anti-CD19 CAR, was run on cell
lysates made for the RNA:Protein assay. Raw data were im-
ported from the MAX digital analyzer into nSolver software v3.0
(NanoString Technologies). Standard quality control checks assessing
imaging, binding density, positive control linearity, and limit of
detection were performed. By utilizing internal positive controls
in the panels, raw gene and protein expression data were first
normalized. The messenger RNA (mRNA) data were further
normalized by the geometric mean of a set of stably expressed
reference genes and the protein data were normalized by the
geometric mean of a set of stably expressed proteins. The
mRNA and proteins expressed below background were filtered
from the analysis using cutoffs of mean plus 2 standard devi-
ations of negative controls (for mRNA) and 3 times the geometric
mean of immunoglobulin G-negative controls (for protein).

 stimulatory/proliferative cytokines, and chemokines. Detailed
evaluation including principal component analysis showed a
complex and heterogeneous functional profile of product T cells,
with both polyfunctional CD41 and CD81 T-cell subsets secreting
predominantly IFN-g, IL-8, IL-5, granzyme B, and/or MIP-1a
(supplemental Figure 1, available on the Blood Web site). No-
tably, the CD41 but not CD81 T-cell population also contained
IL-17A1 polyfunctional T cells.
Overall, products displayed a wide range of PSI values; the
polyfunctional cells comprised ;20% to 25% of all cytokine-
producing product T cells. Global product PSI was significantly
associated with OR (P 5 .0119; Figure 2). The median PSI was
twice as high for responders vs nonresponders. Higher product
PSI was statistically associated with grade $3 CRS (P 5 .0174;
Figure 2). In contrast to PSI findings, a similarly computed index
corresponding to monofunctional T cells in the product did not
have associations with OR, grade $3 NT, or grade $3 CRS (data
not shown). In addition, in this study of limited sample size, major
product phenotypes defined by flow cytometry and IFN-g in
coculture were not associated with clinical response (Figure 3).

Figure 4. Major cytokines driving polyfunctional product CD41 and CD81 T cells by CD19 stimulation that distinguish responders to the therapy from nonresponders.
(A-B) Single-cell proteomic analysis of a panel of 32 secreted cytokines, chemokines, and cytotoxic molecules was performed on product T cells from 20 patients treated with
CAR T cells. The analysis was performed on all product cells or select CD41 and CD81 T cells. The product T cells were first stimulated with CD19-expressing target cells or
control NGFR cells before the analysis. The graphs show PSI (mean 6 standard error) with or without CD19 stimulation for all cells and for CD41 and CD81 subsets separately. The
main cytokine drivers for each product T-cell subpopulation are also shown. (C-D) Product CD41 and CD81 T-cell PSI profiles were broken down per cytokine, between patient
groups with no response and OR to CAR T-cell therapy. Only CD4 and CD8 cytokines that were upregulated relative to mock stimulation are shown. Each cytokine PSI level
reflects its average secretion intensity in polyfunctional single cells. The diagram shows the cytokines that contribute to the polyfunctionality index in the CD81 and CD41 T-cell
populations. (E-F) Polyfunctional strength of major cytokines and chemokines in CD41 and CD81 CAR T cells from nonresponders and responders. FD, fold difference; GM-CSF,

From 
 after infusion, is associated with OR and grade $3 NT, but not
grade $3 CRS.6
Because both CAR T-cell expansion in vivo and product PSI
individually correlated with OR, we tested the impact of a
composite index integrating PSI and CAR T-cell expansion on
the correlation with OR. This index was computed by adding the
2 metrics to each other, after first standardizing them to have
comparable variances (described in “Methods”). This composite
index combining PSI and CAR T-cell expansion improved the
association with OR (P 5 .0046; not adjusted for multiplicity)
compared with each covariate alone (Figure 5). Furthermore, OR
was associated with CD41 PSI plus CAR peak levels (P 5 .0023),
but only marginally with CD81 PSI plus CAR peak levels (P 5 .0507;
supplemental Figure 2). There was no apparent association be-
tween CAR peak levels and PSI (supplemental Figure 3). These
results suggest that PSI in conjunction with CAR T-cell expansion
may be associated with clinical outcome of CAR T-cell therapy.
Because PSI was not significantly associated with commonly
assessed product phenotypes based on CCR7 or CD45RA ex-
pression (Figure 3), we sought to identify other potential product
characteristics associated with PSI. We hypothesized that the
anti-CD19 CAR construct enabled the polyfunctionality of
product T cells. Therefore, CAR gene expression levels were
measured by NanoString (Seattle, WA) in bulk product to-
gether with T-cell housekeeping molecules. Global PSI was
associated with the ratio between CAR mRNA copies and
T-cell–specific markers (supplemental Table 1). This finding
suggests that product CAR expression level influences product
T-cell polyfunctionality.
In contrast to PSI alone, combining product PSI or CD41 PSI with
CAR peak levels was significantly associated with grade $3 NT
(supplemental Figure 4A). As specified in “Methods,” CD41
and CD81 PSIs were calculated for each product by applying
the same prespecified formula to the 2-product T-cell subsets
separately. On the basis of these findings and the putative
pathogenic role of T helper 17 (Th17) cells,13,14 we asked whether
subsets of polyfunctional T cells producing cytokines including
IL-17A were associated with grade $3 NT. Cytokine-specific PSI
was computed by multiplying the percentage of polyfunctional
T cells secreting a given cytokine with the average signal in-
tensity for that cytokine. These cytokine PSI values were ana-
lyzed in relation to outcome. Interestingly, IL-17A PSI, defined
post hoc, plus CAR peak cell levels had a significant association
with grade $3 NT (P 5 .0007; supplemental Figure 4A). Indi-
vidually, CAR peak cell levels and IL-17A PSI were associated
with grade $3 NT (P 5 .0015 and P 5 .0574, respectively). To
strengthen these findings, we explored other product attributes
that may relate to IL-17A PSI. As expected, IL-17A PSI correlated
strongly with the percentage of Th17 cells measured by epi-
genetic marking and IL-17A production in product coculture
(P , .0001 for both comparisons) and was associated with the
CD4/CD8 ratio, percentage of Th cells, and IL-6 levels in product
coculture (supplemental Table 2). In turn, grade $3 CRS was
associated with the global product PSI plus CAR peak levels
(supplemental Figure 4B).
Because IL-15 levels initially elevated by conditioning chemo-
therapy were associated with CAR T-cell expansion and OR,6
we investigated whether pre–CAR T-cell infusion levels of IL-15,
in combination with PSI, were associated with clinical outcome.
Indeed, product PSI combined with IL-15 levels at day 0 had
a statistically significant association with OR (P 5 .0033). OR
also was associated with PSI (P 5 .0119) and IL-15 (P 5 .0153)
individually (Figure 5). However, PSI and IL-15 on day 0 did
not have a statistically significant association with each other.

T-cell levels in blood measured by quantitative PCR were correlated with clinical
outcome. A composite index integrating PSI and CAR T-cell expansion in vivo was
developed as detailed in the supplemental Methods and was associated with OR.
The metrics were added to each other after each was first standardized to have unit
variance. This standardization was achieved by dividing the metrics by their respective
standard deviation to bring them to a common magnitude/scale. Whole product PSI
alone (A), peak CAR levels in blood alone (B), and product PSI in conjunction with peak
CAR levels (C) are shown in association with OR. Pre–CAR T-cell infusion (day 0) IL-15

From 
 PSI, was also strongly associated with OR (P , .0004; sup-
plemental Figure 2). Finally, day 0 levels of IL-15 and IL-17A
PSIs were associated with grade $3 NT and CRS (supple-
mental Figure 5).
These results show that product PSI, together with CAR T-cell
expansion or pre–CAR T- cell infusion levels of IL-15, contributes
jointly to clinical outcomes after CAR T-cell therapy. These
findings also highlight the prominent role of IL-17A polyfunctional
T cells in clinical outcomes, particularly NT, associated with CAR
T-cell therapy.
Discussion
We describe a novel product attribute for CAR T cells associated
with T-cell polyfunctionality and correlated with clinical outcome.
This polyfunctionality index, combined with conditioning-driven
IL-15, a cytokine with potent T-cell proliferative capabilities,15,16 or
CAR T-cell expansion in vivo,6,17-19 is associated with clinical
outcomes post–CAR T-cell therapy.
The study comprised a cohort of patients with aggressive re-
fractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with CAR T cells.6 In
response to ex vivo coculture with CD191 target cells, product
T cells rapidly secrete a broad array of cytokines, chemokines,
and immune effector molecules. These cytokines and chemo-
kines, as well as T-cell characteristics defined by commonly used
phenotypic markers in a heterogeneous population of T cells,
were not significantly associated with clinical outcomes (data
not shown). To understand the parameters that are associated
with clinical outcome in anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, we
characterized product T cells at the single-cell level using PSI8
based on the frequency and production levels of homeostatic/
proliferative, inflammatory, chemotactic, regulatory, and im-
mune effector molecules. To perform this analysis, an SCBC
platform and a prespecified formula were used. In brief, product
PSI was defined as the percentage of polyfunctional cells multi-
plied by MFI of the cytokines secreted by those cells (Figure 1;
details in “Methods”).
This analysis showed that polyfunctional profiles for both
CD41 and CD81 T cells stimulated with CD191 target cells were
composed of select effector molecules (granzyme B), stimulatory/
immune-modulating cytokines (IFN-g, IL-5), and chemokines
(IL-8, MIP-1a). In contrast to CD81 T cells, the CD41 T-cell subset
also comprised IL-17A–secreting polyfunctional cells. The di-
versity and coparticipation of CD41 and CD81 T cells with regard
to the polyfunctional T-cell population are consistent with a CAR
product containing a CD28 costimulatory domain, which is known
to play a signaling role in both subsets.4 Strikingly, only 20% to
25% of all product cells were polyfunctional upon stimulation
with CD19-expressing target cells.
The major finding of this study is that clinical response and
toxicities resulting from CAR T-cell treatment were associated
with the PSI of whole product, or defined T-cell subpopulations,
computed using a prespecified algorithm. Patient 20 is a notable
outlier, because this patient had a high product PSI but did not
achieve an OR (Figure 2A). In this patient, CAR T cells did not
expand well. We hypothesize multiple possible reasons, including
limited T-cell proliferative capability and/or an immune-exclusionary
tumor environment.
Because both CAR T-cell expansion in vivo and product PSI
individually correlated with OR, we explored the impact of a
composite index integrating PSI and CAR T-cell expansion and
association with OR. Similarly, we combined day 0 IL-15 serum
levels with product PSI. Combined indices of PSI with either peak
CAR T-cell levels in blood or with day 0 IL-15 serum levels had
more significant associations with clinical outcomes vs either
parameter alone. Day 0 IL-15 serum levels, elevated by condi-
tioning chemotherapy,6 were measured just before CAR T-cell
infusion. Although the number of evaluable patients in this
cohort was limited, OR was associated with both CD41 PSI plus
day 0 IL-15 and IL-17A PSI plus day 0 IL-15. IL-17A PSI was
determined using a formula-specified post hoc analysis to ad-
dress the hypothesis that an IL-17A–producing T-cell subset may
be preferentially associated with outcomes. CD41 T cells pro-
ducing IL-17A and IFN-g can be potent Th cells, with the ca-
pability of reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and
enabling robust, effective immune-mediated responses.20 In
addition, IL-8 and MIP-1a, coproduced by these polyfunctional
Th cells, are well-known chemokines for a wide range of im-
mune cells, including lymphocytes and myeloid cells.20-22 Al-
though the results point to specialized polyfunctional CD41
T cells correlating with clinical response to a greater degree
than CD81 T cells, they do not exclude a role for effector CD81
T cells, consistent with reports of CD81 T-cell effectiveness in
metastatic melanoma.23
Grade $3 NT had the most statistically significant association
with IL-17A PSI plus peak CAR levels in blood, suggesting the
participation of specialized T cells. Grade $3 CRS correlated
with whole product PSI plus either CAR peak levels or day
0 serum IL-15 levels. These findings point to mechanisms un-
derlying serious adverse events. The best correlates of grade $3
NT were peak CAR levels in blood and an index combining peak
CAR levels in blood plus IL-17A PSI. These results raise the
possibility that high numbers of IL-17A–producing polyfunc-
tional CAR T (Th17) cells in vivo could be implicated in the
pathogenesis of serious NT, while also contributing to OR.
Previous evidence implicated IL-17A in the pathogenesis of
neuroinflammation13,14 and participation in antitumor activity.24
Although global product PSI was not associated with major
T-cell phenotypic markers, it was associated with the level of
CAR gene expression in product T cells.
Polyfunctional T cells have not been extensively evaluated in the
context of engineered T-cell therapies, but they were previously
analyzed in vaccines and infectious diseases, where their pres-
ence was associated with increased protective immunity.7,25
Additionally, presence and characterization of polyfunctional
T cells were reported recently in CAR T cells generated from
healthy individuals.26
Concurrent studies conducted with larger patient cohorts in
conjunction with platform optimization and comprehensive
validation of this methodology are anticipated to enable a better
understanding of single-cell metrics over other technologies.
In summary, this exploratory study underscores the potential
usefulness of monitoring CAR T-cell polyfunctionality as a key
product attribute, complementing other characteristics including
T-cell proliferative capability. Nevertheless, other key questions
remain, such as whether polyfunctionality is partially predetermined

 by T-cell status before manufacturing, and whether polyfunctionality
and clinical outcome could be manipulated through optimizing
T-cell genetic programming, the manufacturing process, or dosing
strategy.
