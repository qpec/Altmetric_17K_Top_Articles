IMPORTANCE Individuals who self-harm may have an increased risk of aggression toward
others, but this association has been insufficiently investigated. More conclusive evidence
may affect assessment, treatment interventions, and clinical guidelines.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between nonfatal self-harm and violent crime.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based longitudinal cohort study,
conducted from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2013, studied all Swedish citizens
born between 1982 and 1998 who were 15 years and older (N = 1 850 252). Individuals who
emigrated from Sweden before the age of 15 years (n = 104 051) or immigrated to Sweden
after the age of 13 years (ie, <2 years before the beginning of the follow-up; n = 22 009) were
excluded. Data analysis was performed from April 21, 2016, to June 4, 2016.
EXPOSURES Receipt of self-harm–associated clinical care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Conviction of a violent crime according to the Swedish
penal code.
RESULTS The study cohort consisted of 1 850 525 individuals (950 382 males and 900 143
females), and the mean (SD) follow-up time was 8.1 (4.7) years (range, 0-17.0 years; minimum
age, 15 years; maximum age, 32 years). During a mean follow-up period of 8.1 years, 55 185
individuals (3.0%) received clinical care for self-harm. The crude hazard ratio was 4.9 (95%
CI, 4.8-5.0) for violent crime conviction in exposed individuals compared with the unexposed
group. Women who self-harm were at particularly high risk for expressing violent behaviors.
After adjustment for relevant psychiatric comorbidities and socioeconomic status, an almost
doubled hazard of violent offense remained (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.8-1.9).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Self-harm is associated with an increased risk of conviction for
a violent offense in both sexes. The risk of violence, as well as the risk of suicide and
self-harm, should be assessed among offending and self-harming individuals.

 N
onfatal deliberate self-harm (DSH) is the act of inflict-
ing harm on oneself through the ingestion of harmful
substances or causing tissue damage (eg, cutting or
burning oneself).1 Although most epidemiologic research in
this area has focused on DSH as a risk factor for completed
suicide,2-5 the term also includes self-harming acts per-
formed without suicidal intent (eg, behaviors aimed at regu-
lating an intense negative state).6-8 Typically, DSH debuts be-
tween the ages of 12 and 14 years, and it is increasingly being
recognized as a serious global health problem9-11 and as a risk
factor for future attempted or completed suicide5 and for the
development of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and
antisocial behavior.12-14
Impulsive hostility and aggression are linked to violent
crime15 and suicide16,17 in psychiatric and forensic pop-
ulations.18,19 Thus, individuals vulnerable to impulsive ag-
gression and self-harm may share a proneness to emotional
dysregulation through increased autonomic arousal and low
tolerance for adversities, particularly related to perceived or
actualinterpersonalthreats.20,21Researchsuggeststhattheex-
pression of aggressive acts toward oneself and others serves
a short-term emotion regulative function (ie, immediate re-
duction of unwanted experiences).6,22-25
Several psychiatric disorders have been associated with an
increased risk of violent crime (eg, bipolar disorder, border-
line personality disorder [BPD], antisocial personality disor-
der [ASPD]).26-29 However, not all phenotypes within and be-
tween psychiatric disorders may be associated with an
increased risk of violence.30 Because self-harm occurs in the
context of many different psychiatric disorders,31 it could be
used as a behavioral marker of an underlying vulnerability of
emotional and behavioral dysregulation relevant to violent
crime(eg,impulsiveaggressionandemotionregulation)across
diagnoses.
We used a large population register to study the associa-
tion between clinical care for self-harm and violent crime. We
hypothesized that we would find a unique association be-
tween nonfatal DSH and violent crime after adjusting for rel-
evant psychiatric comorbidities in a large population-based
cohort.
Methods
National Registers
We conducted a population-based, nationwide cohort study
withdatafromSwedishlongitudinalpopulationregisters.Reg-
isters were linked and anonymized by an independent gov-
ernment agency (Statistics Sweden) using the personal iden-
tification number assigned to all Swedish residents at birth or
immigration.32 After linkage, the data were deidentified, and
the link connecting the data with the personal identification
number was destroyed.
DataonDSHandpsychiatricdiagnoseswerecollectedfrom
the National Patient Register (NPR) held by the National Board
of Health and Welfare,33 which covers somatic and psychiat-
ric inpatient care from 1973 and specialized outpatient care
from 2001. The NPR contains records and diagnoses accord-
ing to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Health-Related Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10) for visits to private and public caregivers, with approxi-
mately 100% coverage for inpatient care and 80% coverage for
outpatient care. Information on outcome was collected from
the National Crime Register (Swedish National Council for
Crime Prevention), which contains information on all crimi-
nal convictions in Swedish lower courts since 1973. We used
the Total Population Register (Statistics Sweden)34 for demo-
graphic data on sex, birth date, death date, emigration, and im-
migration and the Multi-Generation Register (Statistics Swe-
den) for data on family relations. Finally, for information on
Swedish residents’highest level of education, the Education
Register (Statistics Sweden) was used. This study was
approved by the Stockholm Regional Ethics Committee.
Because this was a registry study, no individual was con-
tacted, and informed consent was waived by the Stockholm
Regional Ethics Committee.
Study Cohort
Because previous studies12,35 have indicated that the associa-
tion between DSH and impulsive aggression is age related, we
restricted our cohort to a younger sample. All individuals born
from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 1998, and alive
and residing in Sweden at the age of 15 years were included in
the cohort (N = 1 976 714), excluding all individuals who emi-
grated from Sweden before the age of 15 years (n = 104 051).
To avoid confounding attributable to the stress of being in the
asylum-seeking process, all individuals who immigrated to
Sweden after the age of 13 years (ie, <2 years before the begin-
ning of follow-up; n = 22 009) were excluded from the co-
hort. Furthermore, we excluded patients who died during the
DSH episode, implicating death caused by DSH (n = 102), or
within 1 week after the DSH episode (n = 27) to minimize the
risk of classifying completed suicides or late effects of at-
tempted suicide as nonfatal DSH. Data analysis was per-
formed from April 21, 2016, to June 4, 2016.
Exposure
Exposure was defined as having a record of intentional self-
harm (ICD-9 codes E950-9 and ICD-10 codes X60-84) or an
event of undetermined intent (ICD-9 codes E980-9 and ICD-10
codes Y10-34)3 as registered in the NPR during 1994 to 2013.
Key Points
Question Are individuals who self-harm prone to aggressive
behavior toward others?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 1 850 525
individuals, there was an almost doubled risk of violent crime
among self-harming individuals after adjusting for psychiatric
comorbidity and socioeconomic status.
Meaning The risk of future violence, as well as self-harm and
suicide risk, should be assessed among self-harming and offending
individuals.

 Outcome
Thestudiedoutcomewasconvictionofaviolentcrime,accord-
ing to the Swedish penal code (chapters 3, 4, 6-8, 13, 16, and 17),
during follow-up. Violent crime includes all forms and degrees
ofhomicide,assault,causingdeathorinjury,kidnapping,threats,
stalking,coercion,violationofanother’
sliberty,integrityordomi-
ciliarypeace,sexualcrimes,childpornographycrimes,robbery,
arson,rioting,disorderlyconduct,agitation,orviolentresistance
against authorities. The cohort was followed up from the age of
15years(ageofcriminalresponsibilityinSweden)untilbeingcon-
victed of a violent crime, death, first emigration after the age of
15 years, or end of follow-up (December 31, 2013).
Covariates
We included birth year as a categorical variable in the analy-
ses. Psychiatric diagnoses relevant to DSH and impulsive
aggression (BPD, ASPD, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders [SUDs], eating
disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, any psychotic disor-
ders,andautismspectrumdisorders)wereincludedasdichoto-
mous covariates to determine whether a statistically signifi-
cant association between self-harm and violent crime would
remain after adjustment. We constructed one diagnostic group
of all SUDs and one diagnostic group of all psychotic disorders.
The psychiatric diagnoses were collected from the NPR as hav-
ingarecordofICD-9orICD-10psychiatricdiagnosesatanytime
during the follow-up period (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for
ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes). Bipolar disorder, BPD, and ASPD were
entered as covariates in an adjusted model to study their effect
ontheassociationbetweenDSHandviolentcrimebecausethese
diagnosesrepeatedlyhavebeenconnectedtoimpulsiveaggres-
sion and DSH in clinical samples.17 In a final, fully adjusted
model, all psychiatric diagnoses described above were entered
as covariates. As proxies for socioeconomic status, we used the
mother’
s (biological or adoptive mother) highest level of edu-
cation (7-point ordinal scale, with 1 indicating not having
completed compulsory school to 7 indicating postgraduate
education) and family income at the age of 13 years (in quin-
tiles, calculated per each year), which were used as categorical
covariates in the fully adjusted analyses.
Sensitivity Analysis
To test the robustness of our findings and the specific asso-
ciation of violent crime and DSH, we performed additional
analyses. First, we investigated the association between DSH
andanycrime(ie,violentandnonviolentcrimes[eg,theft,traf-
fic offenses, crimes related to drugs and smuggling, and eco-
nomic crimes]). Second, we investigated a reversed statisti-
calmodelinwhichDSHwasenteredastheoutcomeandviolent
crime was entered as the exposure. Third, we investigated the
particular effect of violent compared with nonviolent crime
on DSH in the reversed model by separating violent and non-
violent crimes and entering them as indicators in a Cox pro-
portional hazards regression model. Fourth, we tested the as-
sociation between DSH and violent crime over differing intent
(undetermined, deliberate) and all levels of DSH lethality2 to
ensure that our findings were not driven by only a small group
of highly lethal DSH acts (eTables 2-6 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We compared exposed and unexposed groups by using χ2 tests
for categorical covariates and independent-sample 2-tailed t
tests for continuous covariates. The Kruskal-Wallis test was
used to compare the overall difference in socioeconomic sta-
tus. We calculated incidence rates (number of events divided
by number of person-years) of violent crime conviction for the
exposed and unexposed groups.
Incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs were estimated, ad-
justed for sex for the total cohort analyses (by stratification)
and separately for men and women in the sex-specific analy-
ses. We performed 2 sets of Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion analyses. During the first step, we did not account for the
timing of the exposure (ie, DSH-associated care) so that the
exposure could have happened at any time during the obser-
vation period (including after a criminal conviction). In the
second step, we included the timing of being exposed to a
DSH-associated event as a time-varying covariate, where
individuals were assumed to be unexposed before their first
DSH event and exposed after the event (ie, only individuals
exposed to DSH before an eventual violent crime conviction
were classified as exposed). Because DSH could occur as
early as 12 years of age, individuals with a DSH diagnosis
before their 15th birthday were classified as exposed at the
beginning of follow-up.
For each set of analyses, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs)
for violent criminal convictions among individuals exposed to
DSH care compared with those not exposed. Furthermore, we
estimated HRs in crude (no covariates), multivariable adjusted
(BPD, ASPD, and bipolar disorder), and fully adjusted (all psy-
chiatriccomorbidityandsocioeconomicstatus)Coxproportional
hazards regression models. All analyses were adjusted for sex
usingstratifiedCoxproportionalhazardsregressionmodels.In
addition, all analyses were adjusted for birth year to control for
changes in rates of registration of DSH. Because we wanted to
explore sex-specific patterns, all analyses were also conducted
separately for men and women. The precision of all estimates
(ie,theCIs)wereadjustedforfamilialclusteringusingacluster-
robust sandwich estimator. To ensure comparable estimates
among all analyses, individuals with missing information on
motherhood,mother’
seducationallevel,and/orfamilyincome
attheageof13yearswereexcluded(n = 63 100[3.4%])fromthe
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses and when esti-
mating the incidence rate ratios. All analyses were conducted
with STATA statistical software, version 14.1 (StataCorp). P <
.05 (2-sided t test) was considered statistically significant.
Results
Our cohort consisted of 1 850 525 individuals (950 382 males
and 900 143 females), and the mean (SD) follow-up time was
8.1 (4.7) years (range, 0-17.0 years; minimum age, 15 years;
maximum age, 32 years).

 received DSH-associated clinical care (exposed), with 29 483
DSH events (53.4%) registered in outpatient clinics. Among
all exposed patients, 8186 (14.8%) had their first record of
DSH before the age of 15 years. The most common form of
self-harm was intentional self-poisoning by unspecified
drugs, medicaments, and biological substances (ICD-10 code
X64; 15 123 patients [27.4%]) followed by intentional self-
harm by a sharp object (ICD-10 code X78; 4814 patients
[8.7%]). Of all patients with DSH, 52 148 (94.5%) had
engaged in low-lethality methods of DSH (cutting, poison-
ing), whereas 2526 (4.6%) engaged in medium-lethality
methods (drowning, gassing), and 511 (0.9%) engaged in
high-lethality DSH (suffocation, strangulation).
We observed statistically significant differences between
the exposed and unexposed group on all investigated vari-
ables (Table 1). Compared with the unexposed group, the ex-
posed group had a larger proportion of women, lower socio-
economicstatus,andhigherpsychiatriccomorbidity,especially
within the ASPD, BPD, and bipolar disorder diagnoses (all
P < .001).
Of the 66 561 individuals who were convicted of a violent
crime during follow-up, 55 873 (83.9%) were male and 10 688

 (16.1%) were female. In total, 8155 (0.4%) of the cohort were
exposed to DSH and convicted of a violent crime.
Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Models
We visually inspected the Schoenfeld residuals for violations
of the proportional hazards regression assumption. No covar-
iate had unacceptable violations. Individuals with observed
DSH events had an almost 5 times higher crude HR of being
convicted of a violent crime at any time during follow-up com-
pared with individuals without exposure to DSH-associated
care (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 4.8-5.0) (Table 2). Adjusting for BPD,
ASPD, and bipolar disorder reduced the HR to 4.3 (95% CI, 4.2-
4.4), whereas in the fully adjusted model including all psychi-
atric comorbidity and socioeconomic status, the HR was
further reduced by more than half (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.8-1.9).
Of the psychiatric diagnoses, SUDs had the strongest associa-
tion with violent criminality in the fully adjusted model (HR,
4.0; 95% CI, 3.9-4.1). When analyzing the HRs separately by
sex, women with DSH events had a 6 to 7 times higher hazard
of being convicted of a violent crime compared with women
without DSH in the crude and adjusted model, whereas men
with DSH had an approximately 4 times higher hazard of being
convicted. However, in the fully adjusted model, all HRs were
considerably more similar, between 1.7 and 2.1, with the high-
est HR in women.
Adjusting for the timing of exposure (the time-varying
covariates model) slightly increased the fully adjusted HR
(HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 2.1-2.2), but the overall pattern of HRs in the
total cohort and the sex-specific analyses was similar to the
patterns in the first sets of Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion analyses described above (Table 3).
Sensitivity Analyses
Analyzing the association between DSH and any crime re-
vealed lower hazards and fewer sex differences in all models
compared with the association with violent crime (eTable 2 in
the Supplement). The reversed model, in which we exam-
ined the association between violent crime as exposure and
DSHasoutcome,revealedhazardssimilartothoseofthemodel
presented in Table 2 and Table 3, with an HR of 1.8 (95% CI,
1.8-1.9) for the total cohort fully adjusted model but a slightly
lower hazard for the time-varying fully adjusted model (HR,
1.9;95%CI,1.8-2.0).Furthermore,separatingviolentfromnon-
violent crime revealed a significantly stronger hazard (HR, 1.1;
95%CI,1.1-1.2;P < .001)ofhavingreceivedclinicalcareforDSH
if exposed for conviction of a violent crime than for non-
violent crime (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Deliberate self-
harm, compared with undetermined intent, revealed higher
HRsinthecrudeandadjustedmodelsbutwasequalinthefully
adjusted model (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Finally, degree
of DSH lethality was positively correlated with hazards of
violent crime (HRs, 4.3-10.2) (eTable 6 in the Supplement).

lent crime in individuals aged 15 to 32 years who had been in

 contact with the health care system because of DSH. We found
a 5 times higher crude HR of being convicted of a violent crime
if exposed to DSH-associated clinical care. After adjusting for
psychiatric comorbidity and environmental factors, DSH was
associated with a doubled risk for a violent crime conviction,
suggestingauniqueassociationbetweennonfatalDSHandvio-
lentoffenseinbothsexes.Ourresultsstrengthenfindingsfrom
previous clinical and epidemiologic studies12,14,36,37 that in-
dicate such a link. With the present study, we extend these ob-
servations to a population-based sample of more than 50 000
individualsintheDSH-exposedgroupandwithmorethan50%
of our data on DSH collected from outpatient clinics.
There was a particularly strong risk of violent offense in
self-harming females, in line with findings of increased risk of
DSH in female violent offenders.18,19 In this cohort, this asso-
ciation was partially explained by SUDs rather than BPD, a psy-
chiatric disorder repeatedly associated with aggressive behav-
iorinself-harmingwomen.38-40ControllingforcomorbidSUDs
contributed to the greatest risk reduction for women (and for
men) with DSH. Substance use disorders have repeatedly been
linkedtoanincreasedriskofviolentcrime,afindingthatseems
to be of particular relevance to individuals with DSH because
difficulties with self-regulation may be exacerbated by alco-
hol or drug abuse.41,42
The sensitivity analyses strengthened our findings
because they found a significantly stronger association with
violent crime compared with any crime and nonviolent crime.
Furthermore, the hazard of violent offense was strong for all
degrees of DSH intent and lethality, thus suggesting that this
increased risk is relevant to nonfatal DSH and not only to more
severe suicidal behaviors or failed suicide attempts.16,17,20
We examined DSH-associated care as a separate exposure
regardlessofotherdiagnosesinapopulation-basedcohort.This
is important because nonfatal DSH is common in community
samples(estimatedprevalenceof13%to17%foradolescentsand
young adults)43 and typically emerges in early adolescence,
sometimes before the onset of any identifiable psychiatric di-
agnosis.Deliberateself-harmdifferstopographically(ie,lessle-
thalmeansused,engagedinmorefrequently)anddemographi-

pletedsuicide.5,36,44,45Althoughthedesignofourstudydidnot
allow us to determine any causal pathways, our study sug-
gests that nonfatal DSH is also associated with criminal aggres-
sion toward others. Of importance, when reversing our analy-
ses,usingviolentcrimeastheexposureandDSHastheoutcome,
we found similar hazards as in our main analysis, suggesting a
sharedvulnerabilitytoimpulsiveandaggressiveactsratherthan
a causal relationship. Several such risk factors and mecha-
nismshavebeensuggested,suchasserotonergicdysfunction,46
impulsive-aggressive traits,16 and emotion regulation
difficulties.22,24,25,47 Thus, DSH could be viewed as an early be-
havioral marker of difficulties with emotional and behavioral
regulation that, independently of co-occurring psychiatric
disorders,31mayincreasetheriskofcommittingviolentcrimes.
Our results are as relevant for antisocial or aggressive individu-
alsastheyareforself-harmingindividuals,andtheresultspoint
to the need for broad assessments and treatment interven-
tions to support vulnerable individuals across both sexes.
Strengths and Limitations
There are several strengths to our study. This is the largest
population-based study, to our knowledge, on the association
between violent crime and DSH, with few missing data and the
possibilitytostudysexdifferenceswhilecontrollingforseveral
relevantconfounders.Ourresultsprovideevidenceofaunique,
significantassociationbetweennonfatalDSHandviolentcrime
by using stringent criteria for exposure and outcome.
Importantlimitationsincludethatourstudydesigndidnot
allow for examination of suicidal intent, repeated DSH (be-
cause we investigated only the first DSH event), or closer ex-
amination of contextual factors preceding the self-harm. In ad-
dition,ourstudy’
sfocusonpatientsaged15to32yearsmaylimit
itsgeneralizabilitytoolderagegroups.Furthermore,healthcare
contacts for DSH are rare,48 and only 3% of our cohort received
DSH-associated clinical care, suggesting that we only captured
a small proportion of self-harming individuals that may not be
representative of the entire self-harming population.13,48 This
limitation is also true for our outcome variable because not all
violent acts lead to criminal convictions.
Conclusions
In the assessment and treatment of individuals who self-
harm, impulsive aggression and emotion regulation difficul-
ties should be investigated and addressed, regardless of sex
and co-occurring diagnoses. In addition, assessment of DSH
in aggressive or antisocial individuals should affect clinical
work and treatment guidelines in both sexes.
