 SUMMARY
A first-in-human, phase 1, double blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study examined the safety,
tolerability, and exploratory efficacy of intravenous infusion of a recombinant growth factor, cimaglermin alfa, in
patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). In these patients on optimal guideline-
directed medical therapy, cimaglermin treatment was generally tolerated except for transient nausea and headache
andadose-limitingtoxicity wasnotedatthe highestplanneddose.Therewasa dose-dependentimprovementinleft
ventricular ejection fraction lasting 90 days following infusion. Thus, cimaglermin is a potential therapy to enhance
cardiac function in LVSD and warrants further investigation. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2016;1:576–86)

H
eart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syn-
drome characterized by inadequate cardiac
function and a characteristic pattern of he-
modynamic, renal, and neurohormonal responses
leading to poor peripheral perfusion and impaired ex-
ercise tolerance. HF is among the leading causes of
mortality and morbidity worldwide (1). Despite ad-
vances in medical therapy, the mortality for HF re-
mains elevated, with overall rates of 35% to 40% at 1
year and 50% at 5 years (2). A significant proportion
of HF patients, particularly those with severe left ven-
tricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), do not adequately
respond to current medical therapy that may include
beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists, diuretics, and vasodilators (3).
Despite many medication- and device-based improve-
ments that have become guideline-based therapy,
there is still a compelling clinical need to enhance car-
diac function and outcomes in HF patients (4,5).
Recombinant neuregulin (NRG)-1b is a naturally
occurring growth factor that acts directly on car-
diomyocytes and is being explored as a potential
therapy for HF. NRG-1b regulates cardiac develop-
ment
through
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
in
the
epidermal growth factor receptor family, ERBB2-4 (6).
The
importance
of
this
NRG-1/ERBB
signaling
pathway in the adult heart was demonstrated clini-
cally when unexpectedly high rates of cardiotoxicity
were observed in association with the chemothera-
peutic agent trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody
that blocks the ERBB2 receptor (7,8). These clinical
results and the ability of NRG-1b to activate cytopro-
tective mechanisms in cardiac myocytes has promp-
ted investigations of its potential to enhance cardiac
function in HF (9,10). Recent animal data support this
notion. NRG-1b is released in response to ischemia,
stress, and exercise, and is beneficial in animal
models
of
cardiac
injury
by
promoting
restorative remodeling (11–13). A recombinant
peptide representing the epidermal growth
factor–like domain of NRG-1b (Neucardin, Zensun
USA Inc., San Diego, California) has been studied in
humans with stable chronic HF, where it improved
hemodynamics acutely (14) and when given by pro-
longed infusion over many days increased left ven-
tricular (LV) systolic function (15).
A larger full-length recombinant NRG-1b3 known as
cimaglermin alfa (cimaglermin; also known as NRG-
1b3, glial growth factor [GGF]-2) is also being exam-
ined as a possible treatment for HF (12,13). Although
cimaglermin and Neucardin both act on ERBB recep-
tor tyrosine kinases, the larger cimaglermin is distinct
in structure, containing kringle and immunoglobulin-
like domains (16,17), and is manufactured in a mam-
malian cell expression system leading to complex
glycosylation. The other domains of cimaglermin,
beyond the epidermal growth factor–like domain,
provide additional differences from the fragment
including receptor binding, signaling, recycling, and
extracellular
matrix binding
(18–22). Cimaglermin
improves cardiac function in rats and swine after
myocardial infarction, even when administered as
brief intravenous infusions twice per week (11–13). In
addition to the HF models, cimaglermin has been
shown to protect cardiomyocytes from toxicity both
in vitro (23,24) and in vivo (25).
Given the preclinical promise of cimaglermin, we
conducted a first-in-human, phase 1, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the safety
and tolerability of single intravenous infusions of
cimaglermin over a range of doses in human subjects
with
LVSD
(left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
[LVEF] #40%) and HF.

 were maintained on an optimal medical regimen for
at least 3 months before enrollment at Vanderbilt
University
Medical
Center
or
Emory
Heart
and
Vascular Center at Emory Saint Joseph’s. All patients
had an LVEF #40% on screening, no significant renal
or
liver
disease,
and
an
existing
implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator. Given the theoretical risk
of administering a growth factor, patients with a
history
of
cancer
were
excluded
and
an
age-
appropriate
cancer
screen
was
completed
before
enrollment. After informed consent, 40 patients with
symptomatic HF were randomized (4:2) to cima-
glermin or placebo in 7 ascending dose cohorts (0.007
mg/kg, 0.021 mg/kg, 0.063 mg/kg, 0.189 mg/kg, 0.378
mg/kg, 0.756 mg/kg, and 1.512 mg/kg). Each cohort of
6 patients was treated in 2 sequences. In sequence 1, 1
patient
received
placebo
and
1
patient
received
cimaglermin. If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
were observed, sequence 2 was initiated with 1 pa-
tient
receiving
placebo
and
3
patients
receiving
cimaglermin. A dose escalation committee evaluated
clinical, laboratory, and electrocardiographic safety
before advancing to the next sequence or dose cohort
(Figure 1). Patients were observed in a hospital for at
least 48 h and then evaluated for adverse events
(AEs) for 24 weeks after infusion with study visits at 1,
2, 4, and 12 weeks. AEs were graded using the Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version
FIGURE 1
Treatment Algorithm
DLT is defined as 1 of the following events deemed to be at least possibly related to study drug: 1) grade III toxicity or above (would
encompass life-threatening events); 2) liver function abnormalities as defined in protocol; or 3) other events clinically judged to necessitate
dose reductions. If a DLT occurs in the dose reduction step, the decision on whether to stop the study or to continue (reducing the dose by
1 additional dose level) will be made by sponsor and the principal investigator in consultation with the DSMB. DLT ¼ dose-limiting toxicity;
DSMB ¼ Data Safety Monitoring Board; GGF ¼ glial growth factor; PBO ¼ placebo.

 4 (26,27). The trial was performed in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice,
and applicable regulatory requirements. The study
was performed at 2 institutions; the protocol was
approved by the institutional review boards, and all
participants gave written informed consent. The Trial
Registration Identifier is NCT01258387.
DRUG
ADMINISTRATION. Cimaglermin
was
pro-
duced
under
Good
Manufacturing
Practices
in
Chinese
Hamster
Ovary
cells
using
animal-
component-free media. The growth factor was pu-
rified to homogeneity using a series of standard
chromatography steps. Patients received a 20- to
30-min intravenous bolus infusion of cimaglermin
in 100 ml of dilution buffer or placebo (dilution
buffer) without any premedication. Patients previ-
ously
on
strong
CYP3A4
inhibitors
had
dose
adjustments 2 weeks before receiving study drug,
as cimaglermin was observed to affect CYP3A4 ac-
tivity in vitro, which is being explored clinically
(NCT01944683).
STUDY CONDUCT. Two-dimensional echocardiogra-
phy was performed at screening (day 0) and on days
8, 14, 28, and 90. LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic
volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular end-systolic
volume (LVESV) were measured from orthogonal
apical views using the Biplane Simpson’s method
(28). Ultrasound contrast was used for technically
difficult studies according to the American Society of
Echocardiography guidelines (29). All studies were
reviewed in a blinded fashion by 2 experienced car-
diologists with echocardiographic expertise. Blood

Overview of Study Schema
(A) The ascending doses of Cimaglermin were randomly assigned, and at the completion of each cohort (n ¼ 6) a safety analysis was done by a
DSMB before proceeding to the next dose level. (B) The initial 30-day screening period included assessment of LVEF, age-appropriate cancer
screening, cardiology assessment for eligibility, and laboratory testing. (C) Eligible patients were dosed on day 0 with a single infusion of
cimaglermin or placebo. Patients were observed in hospital on telemetry for at least 48 h, and multiple safety labs as well as electrocar-
diographic monitoring were performed. Patients returned on days 8, 14, 28, and 90 for laboratory, physical exam, echocardiography, and
other safety assessments. AE ¼ adverse event; DSMB ¼ Data Safety Monitoring Board; LVEF ¼ left ventricular ejection fraction;
PK ¼ pharmacokinetics.

of
antitherapeutic and neutralizing antibody formation
were
performed
at
similar
time
intervals.
More
frequent sampling was performed the first day for
pharmacokinetics. Safety monitoring for rhythm dis-
turbances
included
continuous
telemetry,
Holter
monitoring, and electrocardiography at multiple time
points during the initial hospital stay and at each
subsequent visit. The final patient evaluation was at
day 90 post dose, and patients were contacted by
telephone at 6 months for status assessment. Figure 2
summarizes protocol events.
STATISTICAL METHODS. Given the small size of each
dose cohort, patients were pooled by dose levels
into
approximately
equal
groups
(placebo,
low-,
and high-dose groups) in a post-hoc manner. The
low-dose group (n ¼ 12) comprises the 0.007-mg/kg,
0.021-mg/kg,
0.063-mg/kg
cohorts
and
the
high-
dose
group
(n¼15)
comprises
the
0.189-mg/kg,
0.378-mg/kg,
0.75-mg/kg
and
1.5-mg/kg
groups.
Additionally, the initial dose levels were anticipated
to be sub-therapeutic based on preclinical studies
and were included to ensure safety in a first-in-
human study. Descriptive statistics were used to
summarize the data by treatment group. Continuous
variables were summarized using descriptive statis-
tics such as mean and standard error; categorical
variables were summarized using frequencies and
percentages. Additional exploratory analyses were
performed on echocardiography measurements of
LVEF to evaluate the treatment effects of cima-
glermin
compared
with
placebo.
LVEF
was
pre-
defined as the first exploratory efficacy measure.
Treatment differences were considered statistically
significant if the p values were <0.05. To show the
overall treatment effect over time, the area under the
curve (AUC) as a summary score was evaluated. The
derived AUC scores were analyzed via the analysis of
covariance model, with treatment group as a factor
and corresponding baseline measure as a covariate.
Dunnett’s test was used to adjust for the experiment-
wise type I error rate. A mixed model repeated
measures was also conducted to show the time
profile. The treatment group, corresponding baseline
measure, visit, and treatment by visit interaction
effects were included in the mixed model repeated
measures
model.
The
unstructured
variance-
covariance and Kenward-Roger degree of freedom
adjustment
were
used.
Nominal
p
values
were
presented to show the entire clinical picture. The
relationship of change in LVEF with dose was tested
using
the
Jonckheere-Terpstra
test.
All
statistics
were performed with SAS version 9.4 software (SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Forty patients of a planned 42 (7 cohorts of 6 patients)
were enrolled as study recruitment was suspended
following a serious adverse event (SAE) in the 40th
patient. Eighty-three percent (n ¼ 33) of patients
enrolled were male, 60% had NYHA functional class
II, and 40% had NYHA functional class III symptoms.

 Seventy-three percent (n ¼ 29) had known significant
coronary disease and established ischemic HF. The
mean age was 57.4 � 9.8 years. Other patient char-
acteristics and concomitant medications during the
study period are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Patients
were maintained on optimal medical therapy for at
least 3 months before enrollment in the trial (Table 2).
Given the small size of the study, the demographics
were relatively well matched. There were no clini-
cally significant treatment effects of a single dose of
cimaglermin on hematologic, electrical, or the ma-
jority of biochemical safety laboratory testing per-
formed, with the exception of the DLT described in
more detail below.
There were no acute AEs leading to termination of
drug infusion. There were no study withdrawals due
to AEs. The most frequently observed treatment-
emergent
adverse
events
(TEAEs)
are
shown
in
Table 3. A TEAE was defined as an event with a date of
onset, or worsening, on or after the start of double-
blind treatment and no more than 28 days from the
start date of double-blind treatment. A higher per-
centage
of
patients
receiving
cimaglermin
had
symptoms of a headache (9 of 27, 33% vs. 0 of 13, 0%)
as well as nausea compared with placebo (7 of 27, 26%
vs. 2 of 13, 16%). The summary of serious AEs is
shown in Table 3. Four patients, each in a different
cohort (levels 1, 2, 4, and 7), had 1 serious AE. The
serious AEs occurred in 2 of 12 patients (17%) of the
total low-dose group (cohorts 1 to 3) and 2 of 15 (13%)
of the total high-dose group (cohorts 4 to 7); they
were viral infection requiring admission (cohort 1;
0.007 mg/kg); angina requiring nitroglycerin treat-
ment (cohort 2; 0.021 mg/kg); worsening HF requiring
admission (cohort 4; 0.189 mg/kg); and transient liver
transaminase
elevation
and
hyperbilirubinemia
meeting the criteria of Hy’s law (cohort 7; 1.512
mg/kg) (30). These events, with the exception of viral
infection, were considered by the investigator to be
possibly or probably related to the investigational
product. All of the patients recovered with observa-
tion and medical treatment and without longer-term
sequelae.
No
serious
AEs
were
reported
in
the
following treatment groups: placebo, cohort 3 (0.063
mg/kg), cohort 5 (0.378 mg/kg), and cohort 6 (0.756
mg/kg).
The transient liver transaminase elevation and
hyperbilirubinemia that occurred in 1 patient who
received 1.5 mg/kg of cimaglermin, the highest plan-
ned dose, defined a DLT. This patient presented to a
local emergency department approximately 48 h after
release from the study hospital with abdominal pain
and was found to have elevated liver transaminases
and bilirubin. Normalization of the liver enzymes and
bilirubin, along with resolution of abdominal pain,
occurred over 96 h under careful observation and
symptom management. At the next observed time
point of 14 days after dosing, the liver enzymes
returned to baseline values.
All
study
patients
had
age-appropriate
cancer
screenings that were negative before enrollment. One
patient
with
intermittent
microscopic
hematuria
before enrollment was ultimately diagnosed with
bladder cancer 3 months after receiving study drug.
External review of the details of this case by an expert
urogenital oncologist determined that this was not
likely related to study drug based upon the natural
history and risk factors for the development of bladder
cancers.
Serial
echocardiogram
measurements
were
measured and evaluated in a blinded fashion. The
results of LVEF, LVEDV, LVESV, heart rate, and blood
pressure are summarized in Table 4, and the primary
exploratory efficacy measure of LVEF is displayed in

 placebo-treated patients. In low-dose cimaglermin
treated patients, there was a small nonsignificant in-
crease in LVEF which returned to baseline by 90 days.
In the high-dose cimaglermin treated patients, there
was a mean increase of 9 absolute percentage units of
LVEF, and changes reached their maximum increase
at day 28 (Figure 3) and were sustained throughout
the duration of the safety measurements. Addition-
ally, at the 90-day time point there was a nonsignif-
icant trend toward a reduction in LVESV, especially at
the higher doses (-23.2 ml compared with baseline).
The AUC for absolute changes in LVEF during the 90
days of observation by dose groups is shown in

was significantly increased compared with placebo
and low-dose (0.007-mg/kg, 0.021-mg/kg, and 0.063-
mg/kg cohorts) treated patients (p < 0.01). Even when
censoring the data from the highest dose cohort with
the DLT (cohort 7, 1.512 mg/kg), the sustained in-
creases in LVEF persist over 90 days (Figures 3 and
4A). When mean changes in LVEF over 90 days are
plotted for each individual dose cohort (Figure 4B),
there is a significant correlation between dose and
LVEF change (R2 ¼ 0.6735; p ¼ 0.0012).
DISCUSSION
In
this
first-in-human
study
of
cimaglermin,
a
dose range for future studies was identified. There
were no discontinuations based on AEs. Overall,
the most commonly experienced TEAEs were nausea
(7 of 27, 26%) and headache (9 of 27, 33%) that were
temporally associated with study drug exposure.
Nausea occurred in some patients who received a
placebo infusion (2 of 13, 15%). A DLT of transient
liver transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia
was observed in 1 patient at the highest planned dose.
Some
liver
enzyme
changes
were
anticipated
at
higher doses based on preclinical toxicology studies.
The
liver
transaminase
elevation
and
hyper-
bilirubinemia observed, although it met criteria for
Hy’s law, was temporary and not associated with any
long-term sequelae for the subject.
In addition to these safety findings, the results of
the study appear to indicate that a single infusion of

increase compared with the placebo group (p < 0.01).

a significantly greater increase in LVEF when compared with

the highest dose (1.5 mg/kg) cohort was included (lighter blue

Phase I Study of Cimaglermin in LVSD and HF
583
 cimaglermin may lead to an increase in LVEF, and
this effect seemed to persist for up to 90 days in the
high-dose group. The dose levels of cimaglermin
examined in this study are within the range of doses
used in animal studies and shown to enhance cardiac
function
(11,13).
Preclinical
studies
indicate
that
repeated dosing is necessary for sustained improve-
ment in heart function. Further clinical studies are
required to determine the optimal dose and dosing
interval for this agent, as well as the effect of
repeated dosing on LVEF.
The
exact
mechanism
for
such
a
potentially
enduring effect of cimaglermin on LV systolic func-
tion is not known, but certainly enhancement of
cardiac repair processes is one hypothesis that is
plausible given the known actions of NRG-1b stimu-
lation in cardiac cells (31). The preclinical work lead-
ing
up
to
this
study
used
multiple
doses
of
intravenous cimaglermin over weeks in animals not
on background neurohormonal blockade. There may
be marked species differences in the duration of ef-
fect. Alternatively, the combined effects of cima-
glermin
on
myocyte
survival,
fibrosis,
and
inflammation, in the context of optimal medical
therapy with neurohormonal blockade, may provide a
possible
explanation
for
this
difference
between
preclinical and clinical data (32).
The most frequent side effects, headache and
nausea, are similar to what has been reported with
Neucardin, a recombinant protein based upon only
the epidermal growth factor domain fragment of
NRG-1b (30). Vomiting was observed in preclinical
study of cimaglermin in swine (11), and thus it
appears that gastrointestinal side effects might be a
class effect. These symptoms were easily managed
with standard antiemetics, but the mechanism for
this is not clear at this time. Although infrequent
compared
with
other
AEs,
transient
liver
trans-
aminase
elevation
and
hyperbilirubinemia
is
the
most concerning AE of a single infusion. It will be
important to understand the nature of this poten-
tial
toxicity
so
the
relative
risks
and
benefits
of cimaglermin for the treatment of HF can be
determined.
A theoretical concern for the clinical development
of neuregulins as therapeutic agents is the potential
for growth effects on pre-existing ERBB-driven can-
cers. In this initial study, we screened patients in an
attempt to exclude anyone with a pre-existing tumor.
However, 1 patient with multiple risk factors for
bladder cancer and pre-existing microscopic hema-
turia
developed
gross
hematuria
3
months
after
receiving cimaglermin. This patient was found to
have superficial bladder carcinoma that has since
been
successfully
treated
with
cystoscopy-based
therapy with no evidence of disease recurrence after
more than 1 year. An expert urogenital oncologist
adjudicated this event to be unrelated to study drug
based on the pre-existing hematuria and the expected
growth rates of bladder carcinomas following toxin
exposure.
The safety, tolerability, and cardiac activity of a
range of doses identified in this study support further
work with cimaglermin in chronic HF. At the time of
this submission, a second trial is under way to assess
further
the
safety,
tolerability,
drug-drug
in-
teractions,
and
potential
efficacy
of
cimaglermin
(NCT01944683). Although the etiology of HF was not
part of the inclusion criteria for the current study, we
were careful to make sure that this was a relatively
homogeneous HF population with respect to other
diseases that might impact safety, such as renal
insufficiency,
liver
function
abnormalities,
and
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The study sub-
jects were all symptomatic with NYHA functional
class II to III, American Heart Association stage C
patients, and despite being on stable optimal medical
therapy for a minimum of 3 months (Table 1), showed
increases in LVEF following a single infusion of
cimaglermin.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. The limitations of this study,
by the nature of the design, is that it is a small
study intended to document safety. Because it was
a
first-in-man
dose-escalating
study,
the
initial
doses in humans were known to be subtherapeutic
in animal studies. Similarly, there was only a single
infusion as opposed to multiple doses for the same
reason
to
maximize
patient
safety.
Lastly,
the
relatively short time for follow-up is sufficient to
detect potential changes in cardiodynamics but not
long
enough
to
establish
a
difference
in
major
clinical events.
CONCLUSIONS
A
single
intravenous
dose
of
cimaglermin
was
tolerated in the majority of patients with systolic LV
dysfunction
and
HF
in
a
first-in-human
safety
study.
The
most
common
AEs,
occurring
more
frequently at the higher doses, were headache (33%)
followed by nausea (27%). Serious TEAEs were un-
common, and the DLT at the highest planned dose
(1.5 mg/kg) was a case of transient liver trans-
aminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia meeting
U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance for
drug-induced liver injury (Hy’s law) that resolved
completely within 2 weeks. There was a suggestion
of
improvement
in
LV
function

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In patients with
symptomatic HF due to LVSD on optimal medical therapy, a
single intravenous dose of cimaglermin appears to result in a
dose-dependent improvement in LVEF for up to 90 days. This
therapy was associated with nausea and headache, and at a
higher dose there was transient liver transaminase elevation and
hyperbilirubinemia. The implications of toxicity must be balanced
with potential therapeutic benefit.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Larger prospective randomized
studies are needed with carefully selected doses, as well as
repeat dosing, to establish patient safety and improvement in
ventricular remodeling, functional status, and other measures of
cardiac function.
