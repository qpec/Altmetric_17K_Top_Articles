In
vitro
cell
transformation
assays
(CTA)
are
used
to
assess
the
carcinogenic
potential
of
chemicals and complex mixtures and can detect
nongenotoxic as well as genotoxic carcinogens.
The Bhas 42 CTA has been developed with
both initiation and promotion protocols to distin-
guish
between
these
two
carcinogen classes.
Cigarette smoke is known to be carcinogenic
and is positive in in vitro genotoxicity assays.
Cigarette smoke also contains nongenotoxic car-
cinogens and is a tumour promoter and cocar-
cinogen in vivo. We have combined a suite of
in vitro assays to compare the relative biologi-
cal effects of new categories of tobacco and
nicotine products with traditional cigarettes. The
Bhas promotion assay has been included in this
test battery to provide an in vitro surrogate for
detecting tumor promoters. The activity of an
electronic cigarette (e-cigarette; Vype ePen) was
compared
to
that
of
a
reference
cigarette
(3R4F) in the promotion assay, using total par-
ticulate
matter
(TPM)/aerosol
collected
matter
(ACM) and aqueous extracts (AqE) of product
aerosol emissions. 3R4F TPM was positive in
this assay at concentrations �6 mg/mL, while e-
cigarette ACM did not have any promoter activ-
ity. AqE was found to be a lesssuitable test
matrix in this assay due to high cytotoxicity.
This is the first study to use the Bhas assay to
compare
tobacco
and
nicotine
products
and
demonstrates the potential for its future applica-
tion as part of a product assessment framework.
These data add to growing evidence suggesting
that e-cigarettes may provide a safer alternative
to
traditional
cigarettes.

INTRODUCTION
Cigarette smoke is a highly complex mixture of more
than 6,000 chemicals [Rodgman and Perfetti, 2013]. Of
these compounds, approximately 150 are known toxi-
cants, including both genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcino-
gens. Traditionally, in vitro genotoxicity assays such as
the Salmonella typhimurium mutation (Ames) and micro-
nucleus assays have been used extensively to assess
tobacco products [Aufderheide and Gressmann, 2008;
DeMarini et al., 2008; Thorne et al., 2015]. However, by
their very nature they only focus on initiating events, i.e.,
DNA damage. To form a comprehensive understanding of
potential carcinogenic risk, there is a need to also investi-
gate later cancer related-endpoints, including tumor pro-
motion by nongenotoxic carcinogens that act by various
other means such as the disruption of cellular communi-
cation and signal transduction pathways.
In vitro cell transformation assays (CTA) enable the
detection of both genotoxic and nongenotoxic compounds.
The Bhas 42 assay is one such example, which has the
additional capability of distinguishing between these two
classes of carcinogenic compounds [Sasaki et al., 1990;
Ohmori et al., 2004, 2005]. The potential initiator and/or
promoter activity of test compounds can be detected via
two separate protocols. In recent years, this assay has
undergone a number of international validation studies
and is now the subject of an OCED guidance document

 [Organisation for Economic and Cooperative Develop-
ment, 2016]. Weisensee et al. [2013] and Han et al.
[2016] have shown that Bhas 42 CTA could be useful in
assessing the promoter activity of complex mixtures such
as cigarette smoke. Their work showed that total particu-
late matter (TPM) from a reference cigarette induced cell
transformation
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner.
These findings support long-established knowledge of the
tumor promoter activity of cigarette smoke “tar” in rodent
skin painting studies [Roe et al., 1959] and demonstrate
the suitability of this assay as an in vitro alternative for
this application.
While conventional cigarettes generate complex aero-
sols that are known to contribute to diseases such as lung
cancer in smokers, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may
provide a much safer alternative due to the less complex
aerosol that they produce. The use of e-cigarettes has
increased significantly in recent years. Public Health
England recently reported that e-cigarettes were “95%
less harmful to health than conventional cigarettes” and
could be a means for smokers to quit or reduce their con-
sumption of cigarettes [Public Health England, 2015].
The Royal College of Physicians have recently stated that
“the hazard to health arising from long-term vapour inha-
lation from the e-cigarettes available today is unlikely to
exceed 5% of the harm from smoking tobacco” [Royal
College of Physicians, 2016].
We have recently reported that the levels of toxicant
aerosol
emissions
from
a
commercially
available
e-
cigarette (Vype ePen) are 92–99% lower on a per-puff
basis than those from a reference cigarette (3R4F) [Marg-
ham et al., 2016]. While the greatly reduced chemical pro-
file in e-cigarette aerosols certainly suggests much less
activity
than
conventional
cigarettes
in
toxicological
assays, direct evidence of this has been limited to date. We
have shown in vitro, that ePen e-cigarette aerosols are non-
responsive in mutation and DNA damage assays compared
to 3R4F reference cigarette smoke which demonstrated
strong mutagenic and DNA damage responses under the
same experimental conditions [Thorne et al., 2016, 2017].
ePen e-cigarette aerosol extracts also conferred much lower
oxidative stress in vitro using human lung cells than those
from a 3R4F reference cigarette [Taylor et al., 2016]. It
must be noted that e-cigarettes in general can vary greatly
in their aerosol emission as a result of device characteris-
tics and the formulation of the liquid, which may or may
not contain nicotine [Farsalinos et al., 2016].
The purpose of this study was to compare the promoter
activities of a traditional conventional cigarette versus a
commercially available e-cigarette as measured by the Bhas
promotion CTA in both the particulate and vapour phases.
TPM generated from 3R4F reference cigarettes and aerosol
collected matter (ACM) from Vype ePen e-cigarette enabled
the assessment of the particulate fraction of the cigarette
aerosol and the corresponding nongaseous phase of the e-
cigarette aerosol, respectively (e-cigarette aersols do not
contain particulates, but rather aerosolized propylene glycol
and vegetable glycerine). Aerosol aqueous extracts (AqE)
generated from both product types provided the assessment
of the particulate and water-soluble components of the
vapor phase. Previous studies assessing cigarette smoke in
the Bhas 42 assay have used TPM prepared using the ISO
puffing regime standard 3308 [International Organization
for Standardization, 2000]. For this study, a more intense
smoking regime Health Canada Intense (HCI) was used in
preparing the TPM, ACM, and AqE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Reagents
All chemicals and reagents used were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Gillingham, UK) unless otherwise stated.
Test Products
The 3R4F reference cigarette (University of Kentucky, Kentucky)
was used in this study. This king-size product contains US blended
tobacco with a cellulose acetate filter having a International Organisation
for Standardisation (ISO) tar yield of 9.4 mg. Prior to the production of
TPM or AqE, cigarettes were conditioned for at least 48 hr at 22 6 18C
and 60 6 3% relative humidity in accordance with ISO 3402 [Interna-
tional Organization for Standardization, 1999].
Vype ePen (Nicoventures, Blackburn, UK) e-cigarettes were also
used in this study. Vype ePen were obtained from Nicoventures Trading
(www.govype.com). Vype ePen is a rechargeable, closed modular sys-
tem, consisting of a rechargeable battery section and a replaceable car-
tridge (cartomizer) of nicotine-containing liquid (e-liquid; Fig. 1). It is
operated by a button and has two voltage settings; 4 V and 3.6 V (4 V
was used in the study). Vype ePen e-liquid cartridges (Blended Tobacco
Flavor) contained a reported 18 mg/mL nicotine and were stored at
room temperature. Devices were used with fully charged batteries and
loaded with a new cartomiser for each use.
Generation of TPM and ACM
The production of 3R4F TPM was carried out on a Borgwaldt
RM200A rotary smoking machine (Borgwaldt-KC, Hamburg, Germany).
Cigarettes were smoked under the HCI puffing regime (55 mL puff vol-
ume, of 2 sec duration, every 30 sec, 100% vent blocking) using a bell-
shaped puff profile, as per the Health Canada Official Method T-115
[Health Canada, 1999]. ACM from the e-cigarette was produced using a
Borgwaldt LM20X (Borgwaldt-KC) linear machine with a modified ver-
sion of the regime used for TPM production in which the puffing regime
was 3 sec duration using a square-wave puff profile (CORESTA, 2015;
Table I). The e-cigarette was
activated via the use
of a
puff-
synchronised robot, 1 sec prior to the puff commencing and was held in
position for the duration of the puff.
Approximately 150 mg of TPM or ACM were collected on 44 mm
Cambridge filter pads (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). The same number of
puffs was used to generate enough TPM/ACM from each product for
each pad (4 sticks of 3R4F (10 puffs/stick) and 40 puffs from the e-ciga-
rette). Pads were weighed before and after TPM/ACM collection. Dime-
thylsulphoxide (DMSO) was used to elute the TPM or ACM from the
pads to a stock concentration of 24 mg/mL (Fig. 2). Additional pads
were prepared in parallel for determination of water and nicotine content
in the TPM/ACM. A single batch each of 3R4F TPM and e-cigarette
ACM was created for all experiments, by pooling the extracts from a

 number of pads. The extracts were stored in single-use volumes at
2808C. The samples were shipped on dry ice to the testing facility and
stored at �–608C until required.
Generation of AqE
3R4F reference cigarettes and e-cigarettes were smoked on a Ceru-
lean SM-450 linear smoking machine (Cerulean, VA) under the same
regimes described above (Table I).
AqE from both the 3R4F cigarette and e-cigarette was produced by
bubbling 10 puffs from each product through 20 mL of nonsupple-
mented Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 medium
(Gibco, New York, NY) using a glass impinger (Fig. 2). To provide a
sufficient volume of sample for cell transformation and parallel cell
growth assays, multiple samples were combined and then aliquotted into
the required volumes for each experiment. The samples were sealed in
glass containers, frozen at 2808C and shipped overnight to the testing
facilities. Samples were used within 48 hr of production. A separate
batch of AqE was therefore prepared and used for each treatment time-
point in the preliminary cytotoxicity assay and promotion/parallel cyto-
toxicity experiments.
The following measurements were taken and used as a form of qual-
ity control for each 3R4F AqE sample produced: carbon monoxide
produced during the AqE production, AqE nicotine concentration, and
the optical density at 320 nm. These tests were performed as previously
described [Taylor et al., 2016].
Cell Culture
Bhas 42 mouse fibroblast cells were obtained from Hatano Research
Institute, Food and Drug Safety Centre, Japan Cell Bank (Ochiai, Japan).
Cells were cultured in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS and
50,000 U penicillin and 50 mg streptomycin. Three days prior to treat-
ment with TPM, ACM, or AqE, Bhas 42 cells were maintained in
DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS. This media was used
to dilute the test solutions to concentrations to be used in each
experiment.
Cell Growth
The test samples were assessed in a cell growth assay to determine
the concentrations for the promoter assay. Frozen stock cells were
thawed and cultured in 20–50 mL of M10F in T-75 flasks, at a volume
of 10 mL per flask. 3 to 4 days later, the cells at approximately 70%
confluence were trypsinized and resuspended in DF5F at 0.7–1 3 104
cells/mL. The cell suspension was transferred at a volume of 10 mL to

 T-75 flasks and incubated for 3 days. The cells at approximately 70%
confluence were then trypsinized and suspended in DF5F at 7,000 cells/
mL. The cell suspension was distributed into each well of six-well plates
at a volume of 2.0 mL (14,000 cells/well). After seeding, the six-well
plates were incubated at standard conditions. Wells for the vehicle and
blank controls were also included.
Test article treatments were performed 4 days later. Treatment media
pH was checked and adjusted if needed. Three wells per test article con-
centration, vehicle control, positive control, and blank control were
treated for 3 days. The wells were fixed with methanol; the cells were
stained with crystal violet solution for at least 15 min, rinsed with water,
and air-dried. The dye retained by the cells in each well was extracted
with 2.0 mL of extraction solution (50% [v/v] ethanol with 0.02 mol/L
HCl) by gentle shaking for at least 10 minutes, and the optical density
of each extract was measured at a wavelength between 540 and 570 nm.
Growth rates relative to the solvent/vehicle control culture were calcu-
lated. The doses for the promoter transformation (definitive) assay were
selected with the highest dose having approximately 50% relative toxic-
ity. In cases where the test article increased cell growth, the concentra-
tion with increased cell growth was used as the highest concentration for
the definitive assay.
Promoter Assessment
Prior to the initiation of promotion assay, a single cell growth assay,
as illustrated in Figure 3, was carried out to identify concentrations with
a relative toxicity of 50% and above. The promotion assay was carried
out as shown in Figure 3 and described previously [Weisensee et al.,
2013]. In brief, 14,000 cells/well were seeded and maintained in six-
well plates for 3 days (day 3 to day 0). A total of six wells per treatment
were used. Cells were treated with test solutions for 10 days with a
change to fresh treatment medium on days 7 and 10. On day 14, treat-
ment medium was replaced with fresh DMEM/F12 supplemented with
10% FBS and left to incubate for a further 7 days, after which the cells
were fixed with methanol. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA;
50 ng/mL) served as a positive control. A test was considered valid if
the positive control response was statistically significant compared to the
vehicle control (t-test, P � 0.050. A cell growth assay was carried out in
parallel to each promoter experiment as illustrated in Figure 3. A total
of three wells per treatment group were used for this experiment.
Data Analysis
A one-sided ANOVA with Dunnett’s test was used to assess the
increase in the number of transformed foci per well. Significance level
was set at 95% (P < 0.05). For the TPM and ACM experiments, the
treatment groups were compared against the response of the DMSO
vehicle control. AqE treatments were compared against cells treated
with cell culture medium alone.

TPM/ACM
Analytical chemistry data showed that 3R4F TPM con-
tained 50 mg nicotine/mg, while e-cigarette ACM contained
15.4 mg nicotine/mg (Supporting Information Table II).
Promoter Activity of Cigarettes and e-Cigarettes
AqE
A rangefinder experiment was used to ascertain the
concentration of 3R4F AqE (0–50%) that could be used
in the promoter and parallel cell growth assays (Support-
ing Information Table III). AqE concentrations of �15%
resulted in a complete loss of cell viability. The following
final concentrations were selected for use in the definitive
promoter and parallel cell growth assays: 0.313, 0.625,
1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10% 3R4F AqE.
Concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10% 3R4F AqE had high
toxicity in the parallel cell growth assay, with a viability
of less than 33% (Fig. 4B) and so were not scored for
cell transformation. However, the transformation assay
results from the lower noncytotoxic 3R4F AqE concentra-
tions were negative, as they all failed to induce a signifi-
cant increase in the number of transformed foci compared
to the negative control across all three experiments
(P � 0.05, Figure 4A).
AqE from ePen e-cigarette was also assessed in a pre-
liminary rangefinder (0–100% AqE) and found not to
exhibit any toxicity at concentrations up to the maximum
100% AqE. It was determined to be negative for cell
transformation in the definitive assay when tested up to
this top concentration (Fig. 5). Positive control TPA treat-
ment resulted in a significant increase in transformed foci
in all experiments.
TPM/ACM
A preliminary concentration rangefinder was performed
using concentrations of 12–120 mg/mL of TPM/ACM from
each product. These experiments showed that the average
relative viability in the 3R4F TPM treatment group did not
fall below 50% even at the top concentration used (120

 mg/mL, Supporting Information Table III). ACM from the
e-cigarette was less toxic than the TPM from the 3R4F
cigarette, having low toxicity across all concentrations
tested. The following final concentrations were selected for
use in the definitive Bhas promoter and parallel growth
assay: 3.0, 6.0, 12, 24, 48, 60, and 120 mg/mL TPM/ACM.
3R4F TPM was positive in all three experiments. Sig-
nificant increases in the number of transformed colonies
were consistently seen at concentrations of 6, 12, 24, 48,
and 60 mg/mL across all three experiments (P > 0.05; Fig.
6A). ACM from the e-cigarette was shown to be negative
in all three promoter experiments. None of the tested con-
centrations caused a significant increase in the number of
transformed colonies when compared to the vehicle con-
trol (P > 0.05; Fig. 6A).
ACM from the ePen e-cigarette was shown to be less
toxic than TPM from the 3R4F in the parallel cell growth
assay (Fig. 6B). The average viability for the e-cigarette
ACM did not fall below 93.6 6 9.8%, whereas the TPM
from 3R4F did not fall below 73.9 6 16.5%. Positive con-
trol TPA treatment resulted in a significant increase in
transformed foci in all experiments.
DISCUSSION
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. In the
UK, approximately 357,000 new cases were diagnosed in
2014 [Cancer Research UK, 2016a], while 163,444 peo-
ple died from cancer in the same year [Cancer Research
UK, 2016b]. Lung cancer accounts for the largest propor-
tion (>1 in 5) of all cancer deaths in the UK, 2014
[Cancer Research UK, 2016b], and is also the most prev-
alent cancer type responsible for mortality globally, with
1.6 million deaths in 2012 [Ferlay et al., 2013]. A land-
mark study by Doll and Peto in 1981, recognized that
most cancers in Western industrialised countries are
attributable to lifestyle factors and habits such as cigarette
smoking,
diet,
infections,
and
occupational
chemical
exposure, with diet (35%) and tobacco (35%) being the
greatest single contributors [Doll and Peto, 1981]. It has
been estimated that about 75% (smokers) or 50% (non-
smokers) of all cancer deaths in the United States could
be avoided by eliminating these risk factors [Peto, 2001].
Reducing the exposure to the toxicants present in ciga-
rette smoke is seen by many as a means of minimizing
the burden of smoking related diseases such as cancer,
both on society as a whole and on an individual level.
The use of e-cigarettes as a replacement for traditional
cigarettes has been advocated by institutions such as the
UK Royal College of Physicians, due to the reduced toxi-
cant profile of the aerosols that these products generate
[Royal College of Physicians, 2016].
The assessment of the carcinogenic potential of ciga-
rette smoke has traditionally relied on in vivo inhalation
and skin painting studies [Coggins, 2002; Walaszek et al.,
2007]. These approaches are not ideal for many reasons.
Lung tumors are notoriously difficult to induce in rodent
models upon exposure to tobacco smoke due to physio-
logical and behavioural interspecies differences when
compared to humans [Hecht, 2005]. The skin painting
model, where tobacco smoke tar is topically applied to
the dorsal skin of a rodent, can also be questioned as to
its relevance to human lung exposure. In addition, the
time and cost implications make the use of animal models
such as these unsuitable for screening products in large
numbers, as well as being considerably unethical . This
has led to the use of in vitro genotoxicity assays for
tobacco product assessment and the increased develop-
ment and application of in vitro assays for the testing of
novel tobacco products and nicotine delivery devices.
This drive to develop and adopt in vitro approaches for
carcinogenic risk assessment has grown in parallel with a
desire from the wider scientific community to replace the
traditional rodent bioassay for both ethical and practical
reasons.

 In vitro CTAs have been used since the 1960s for the
detection of carcinogens [Berwald and Sachs, 1963].
They are often used as a complement to a traditional gen-
otoxicity test battery, due to their ability to detect both
genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogens. In 2013, the EU
Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing
recommended that CTAs should be considered in combi-
nation with complementary information as part of a
weight of evidence approach to identify substances with
carcinogenic potential [EURL ECVAM, 2013]. The Bhas
42 CTA has also been the subject of an OECD Guidance
Document [Organisation for Economic and Cooperative
Development, 2016], which helps to pave the way for sci-
entific and regulatory community to apply the assay in
this way. We have previously described the development
and application of a two-stage modification of the Syrian
hamster embryo (SHE) CTA to assess initiation and pro-
motion potential of cigarette smoke [Breheny et al., 2005].
While this assay was successful in identifying initiator and
promoter activity of cigarette smoke TPM, the dose–
response curve of the assay for positive controls and TPM
was not sufficiently robust to facilitate product compari-
sons. This in in contrast to the Bhas 42 CTA, which gave
a robust dose-reponse to cigarette smoke TPM [Weisensee
et al., 2013] and prompted our current investigation on its
potential for product assessment and comparison purposes.
This study is the first to assess the cell transformation
potential of an e-cigarette aerosol and to compare it to that
of a conventional cigarette. Both products were evaluated
using two different test matrices, produced from aerosols
which were generated under standardised conditions [Health
Canada, 1999; CORESTA, 2015]. We investigated the use
of AqE as a test matrix in this assay as an approach to cap-
ture vapor phase components of the aerosols. In this
approach,
aerosols
were
bubbled
through
cell
culture
medium to capture the particulate and vapor-phase water-
soluble components [Taylor et al., 2016]. AqE from both
the reference cigarette and the commercial e-cigarette were
negative in the Bhas promoter assay. However, AqE from
the 3R4F cigarette showed a high level of cytotoxicity, and
there was a very narrow concentration range at which it
could be assessed for cell transformation frequency. The
maximum concentration at which it could be scored for
foci formation was 1.25% 3R4F AqE, while e-cigarette
could be scored at concentrations up to the maximum
100% AqE tested. This indicates that the composition and
relative levels of cigarette smoke aerosol constituents cap-
tured by the AqE are more likely to drive cytotoxicity than
to induce the cellular and molecular events that lead to cell
transformation. The toxicity profile of 3R4F AqE indicated
that an extremely narrow concentration range could be used
for assessment of cell transformation by this test article.
Any potential promoting activity could be masked by the
toxicity of 3R4F smoke components captured in the AqE.
In a recent study we have shown that gaseous components
of the cigarette aerosol, such as carbonyls, are captured
quite effectively, while particulate constituents such as
tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) are less efficiently
retained in this aqueous matrix [Taylor et al., 2016]. In the
same study, 3R4F AqE was demonstrated to induce signifi-
cantly higher levels of oxidative stress in human lung cells
than its e-cigarette equivalent [Taylor et al., 2016]. Cyto-
toxicity and oxidative stress are likely to be driven at least
to some extent by the carbonyls and other gaseous compo-
nents of the AqE. Further refinement of the AqE dilutions
used in the promotion assay may mitigate against the
observed toxicity, but the authors were not convinced that a
clear
dose-response
with
a
dynamic
range
could
be
obtained using AqE. AqE was deemed not an ideal test
matrix for assessing the in vitro promoting activity of aero-
sols from cigarettes, and therefore also not useful for prod-
uct comparison purposes in this study.
As AqE was not found to be an effective matrix for the
comparison of the transforming potential of cigarettes
with e-cigarettes, we built upon previous studies with cig-
arette smoke TPM [Weisensee et al., 2013], to investigate
the use of this test article for product comparison pur-
poses. Particulate based TPM trapping techniques were
used, which have been extensively described for cigarette
smoke assessment [DeMarini et al., 2008]. For e-cigarette
aerosol matter capture, a comparable technique to TPM
was used, whereby an e-cigarette aerosol was captured on
a Cambridge filter pad and eluted with DMSO for testing
(Thorne et al, 2016).
TPM from a 3R4F reference cigarette is a strong pro-
moter in the assay and was positive at many concentra-
tions in this range, as low as 6 mg/mL TPM (12.5 ng/mL
nicotine). Conversely, we have shown that the particulate
matter (ACM) from e-cigarettes is negative in the Bhas
42 CTA when tested at concentrations up to 120 mg/mL
(77 ng/mL nicotine). This study follows our own previous
findings that the Bhas 42 CTA can distinguish between
the potential promotion activity of a conventional ciga-
rette and a tobacco heating product [Breheny et al.,
2015], and supports the work of others who demonstrated
the potential use of the assay in tobacco product assess-
ment [Weisensee et al., 2013; Han et al., 2016].
It is long-established that the particulate phase of ciga-
rette smoke can drive tumor promotion in rodent skin
painting studies [Roe et al., 1959]. It is thought that the
skin tumor promoting effect of the smoke “tar” in this
assay may be a result of specific expansion of initiated
cells [Meckley et al., 2004]. A strong positive correlation
between a compound’s ability to induce sustained hyper-
plasia and its tumor-promoting efficacy has been observed,
although the role of the mutation(s) caused by the initiator
is also considered to be very important [Smith et al.,
2006]. Our findings in this study certainly point to the par-
ticulate phase of the cigarette smoke aerosol as the princi-
pal protagonist of the promotion stage in tumourigenesis,

 and support the preferred use of TPM/ACM in studies to
evaluate and compare the promotion potential of tobacco
and alternative nicotine delivery devices.
Results from this study suggest that e-cigarettes may have
reduced tumor promoter activity compared to conventional
cigarettes and therefore may provide a safer alternative to
cigarettes. Furthermore, the Bhas 42 assay can be used as a
complementary test alongside the traditional genotoxicity
assays applied in the carcinogenic assessment potential of
tobacco and nicotine products. Use of CTA and other in
vitro endpoints, along with clinical studies and consumer
behavior data, can be included as part of a reduced risk
product assessment framework such as that proposed by
Lowe et al. [2015], to help assess the safety of current and
novel tobacco and nicotine products.
