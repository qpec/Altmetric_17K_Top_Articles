Background
The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in
primary care.
Objectives
To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical
diagnosis of acute bronchitis.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to
13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive
cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.
Main results
We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary
analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically
improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49
to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants,
RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776
participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-
up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance.

 Antibiotic-treatedparticipantswere more likelytobe improvedaccording to clinician’sglobal assessment (6 studieswith 891 participants,
RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants,
RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809
participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49
days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance.
There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20,
95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).
Authors’ conclusions
There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial
effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However,
the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting
condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.

Antibiotic treatment for people with acute bronchitis
Review question
We wanted to know whether antibiotics improve outcomes for people with acute bronchitis. We also assessed potential adverse effects
of antibiotic therapy.
Background
Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis (based on medical signs and patient-reported symptoms) for an acute cough, which may or may
not be associated with coughing up mucus or sputum. Acute bronchitis can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Symptoms generally last
for two weeks but can last for up to eight weeks. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to treat acute bronchitis, but they can have
adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhoea as well as cause more serious reactions in those who are allergic. There is no practical test
to distinguish between bacterial and viral bronchitis.
Study characteristics
We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in people with acute bronchitis
or acute productive cough and no underlying chronic lung condition. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants. Co-treatments
with other medications to relieve symptoms were allowed if they were given to all participants in the study.
Key results
Our evidence is current to 13 January, 2017.
We found limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis. Some people treated with antibiotics
recovered a bit more quickly with reduced cough-related outcomes. However, this difference may not be of practical importance as it
amounted to a difference of half a day over an 8- to 10-day period. There was a small but significant increase in adverse side effects in
people treated with antibiotics. The most commonly reported side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, and rash.
This review suggests that there is limited benefit to the patient in using antibiotics for acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy individuals.
More research is needed on the effects of using antibiotics for acute bronchitis in frail, elderly people with multiple chronic conditions
who may not have been included in the existing trials. Antibiotic use needs to be considered in the context of the potential side effects,
medicalisation for a self limiting condition, cost of antibiotic treatment, and in particular associated population-level harms due to
increasing antibiotic resistance.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of these trials was generally good, particularly for more recent studies.

Description of the condition
Acute bronchitis is a common illness characterised by fever and
cough that is often wheezy in nature and that may or may not
be productive. The condition occurs when the bronchi become
inflamed due to either viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms gen-
erally last for two weeks, but the associated cough can last for up
to eight weeks (CDC 2013). Acute bronchitis is the ninth most
common outpatient illness recorded by physicians in ambulatory
practice in the USA (Delozier 1989), and the fifth most common
outpatient illness encountered by Australian general practitioners,
for whom it represents 3.5% of encounters and 2.4% of problems
seen (Meza 1994). In the UK, there are 300 to 400 consultations
for treatment of respiratory tract infections per 1000 registered
patients each year, and while antibiotic prescribing for these con-
ditions declined between 1995 and 2000, it has since stabilised
(Gulliford 2011). Data provided by the European Centre for Dis-
ease Prevention and Control on trends in antimicrobial consump-
tion across Europe suggests that overall antibiotic use varies across
Europe, with most countries showing an increase between 1997
and 2010 (ECDC 2013).
Population-based estimates of the incidence of acute bronchi-
tis range from 33 to 45 cases per 1000 per year (Ayres 1986;
Mainous 1996). People with bronchitis miss an average of two to
three days off work per episode. The great majority of episodes
of acute bronchitis in healthy individuals are presumed to be viral
infections, although this has been questioned (Macfarlane 1994).
Community-based studies have isolated viruses in 8% to 23% of
cases (Boldy 1990; Macfarlane 1993; Stuart-Harris 1965). Other
pathogens implicated in acute bronchitis are Mycoplasma pneumo-
niae, Chlamydiapneumoniae, andBordetellapertussis, each of which
has been identified in up to 25% of cases in various populations
(Boldy 1990; Falck 1994; Foy 1993; Grayston 1993; Herwaldt
1991; Jonsson 1997; King 1996; Macfarlane 1993; Robertson
1987; Stuart-Harris 1965; Thom 1994). A more recent study as-
sessing the aetiology and outcome of acute lower respiratory tract
infection in 638 adults in UK primary care showed that in 55%
of cases viral or bacterial pathogens were identified (Macfarlane
2001).
Description of the intervention
The use of antibiotics in people with acute bronchial infections re-
mains a controversial area in primary healthcare practice (Coenen
2007; Del Mar 2016; Gonzales 1995). Streptococcus pneumo-
niae,Haemophilus influenzae, andMoraxella catarrhalis have been
isolated from sputum samples in up to 45% of people with acute
bronchitis (Henry 1995; Macfarlane 1993), but their role is dif-
ficult to assess due to potential oropharyngeal colonisation in
healthy individuals (Laurenzi 1961; Smith 1986). Unfortunately,
there are no clinically useful criteria that accurately help distin-
guish bacterial from viral bronchial infections, therefore some au-
thors have called for physicians to stop prescribing antibiotics for
people with acute bronchitis (Gonzales 1995; Hueston 1997).
Nevertheless, antibiotics are prescribed for 60% to 83% of peo-
ple who present to physicians with the condition (Gonzales 1997;
Mainous 1996; Meza 1994; Petersen 2007; Straand 1997).
How the intervention might work
Antibiotics may improve outcomes in acute bronchitis if the dis-
ease is caused by a bacterial infection. Antibiotics have no antiviral
activity and are therefore not effective in viral bronchitis. In ad-
dition, antibiotics can cause harm due to their negative effect on
normal bacteria colonising the intestine. The most common ad-
verse effects of antibiotics include gastrointestinal symptoms such
as nausea and diarrhoea, but they can also cause more serious re-
actions related to anaphylaxis in those who are allergic.
Why it is important to do this review
Some estimate of the probable effectiveness of antibiotic therapy
for acute bronchitis is needed given the frequent occurrence of the
condition. If found to be effective, antibiotics could shorten the
course of the disease and consequently reduce the associated loss
of productive work time. However, any benefit from antibiotics
must be weighed against the possibility that excessive antibiotic
use will lead to increases in cost and patient morbidity, as well
as the development of resistant strains of common organisms,
Coenen 2007; Molstad 1992, and unnecessary medicalisation of
individuals with a self limiting illness (Little 2005). If antibiotics
are found to be ineffective, then their use should be discontinued.

Antibiotics for acute bronchitis (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Randomised controlled trials in people with acute bronchitis as-
signed to treatment with an antibiotic or to a placebo or no active
treatment.
Types of participants
We included trials evaluating people of either sex and any age
with a clinical syndrome of cough with or without productive
sputum, with a physician’s diagnosis of acute bronchitis or cough
with persistent cold or flu-like illness that was not resolving. The
term ’acute lower respiratory tract infection when pneumonia is
not suspected’ is also used to describe this clinical presentation.
We excluded trials that included people with pre-existing chronic
bronchitis (i.e. acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis).
Types of interventions
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing any an-
tibiotic therapy versus no treatment or placebo in the manage-
ment of acute bronchitis. We excluded trials comparing one an-
tibiotic regimen with another, or trials comparing the use of other
active medications (such as bronchodilators) with antibiotic ther-
apy in this review. We included trials that allowed concurrent use
of other medications such as analgesics, antitussives, antipyretics,
or mucolytics if they allowed equal access to such medications to
participants in both the antibiotic and the control group.
Types of outcome measures
We included the following range of cough-related and general
clinical outcomes.
Primary outcomes
1. Cough-related outcomes including:
i) time to resolution of cough;
ii) sputum production, defined as proportion of
participants with or without sputum;
iii) proportions of participants with cough, night cough,
productive cough.

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
For this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Reg-
ister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2016, Issue 11, part of the
Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com/) (accessed 13 Jan-
uary 2017), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infec-
tions Group’s Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to January
week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS
(Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences)
(1982 to 13 January 2017). We used the search strategy described
in Appendix 1 to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We adapted
the search strategy to search Embase (Appendix 2) and LILACS
(Appendix 3). Details of the 2017 update search can be found in
Appendix 4.
Searching other resources
We searched the World Health Organization International Clini-
cal Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/
en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/) on 5 April 2017.
We also searched the reference lists of relevant trials, and we orig-
inally searched review articles and textbook chapters to identify
additional trials, including those published prior to 1966. For the
original review, we included in our searches articles from the re-
view authors’ personal collections and requested unpublished trials
from trial authors. In addition, for the earlier version of this review
we also contacted drug companies that manufacture antibiotics.
There were no language or publication restrictions.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
One review author (SS) evaluated the titles and abstracts of the
identified citations and applied the inclusion criteria. We obtained
the full papers of trials deemed potentially relevant for further
examination. Two review authors (TF, SS) screened the full-text
papers to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. We discarded
reports that were clearly irrelevant. We recorded studies that did
not fulfil the inclusion criteria along with the reasons for their
exclusion in the Characteristics of excluded studies table..
Data extraction and management
Two or more review authors independently extracted data using a
data collection form designed for this review. Any disagreements
were resolved by discussion between the review authors. We trans-
ferred data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014).

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (SS, TF) evaluated the methodological qual-
ity of each trial using Risk of Bias domains recommended in the
Cochrane Handook as outlined in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Dis-
agreements were resolved by consensus.

Measures of treatment effect
The effect measures of choice were risk ratio (RR) for categorical
outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.
Unit of analysis issues
There were no cluster-randomised trials included in this review as
it involved a simple drug trial with a placebo comparator. Clini-
cians were generally blinded to the intervention. We identified no
unit of analysis errors.
Dealing with missing data
Where data were missing we reported this in the Risk of bias in
included studies section. We did not adopt any strategies to deal
with missing data such as imputation. In general, missing data did
not bias the review findings.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Where we considered clinical heterogeneity to be an issue, we un-
dertook a random-effects meta-analysis rather than a fixed-effect
meta-analysis. This applied in particular to the most recent anal-
ysis added to this updated version of the review (Analysis 6.1).
Assessment of reporting biases
We examined funnel plots for each of the analyses conducted and
none indicated a significant level of reporting bias.
Data synthesis
All previous versions of this review presented fixed-effect meta-
analyses. For this update, we included a range of outcomes under
the broad definition of ’clinically improved’. These were clinically
heterogeneous, so we used a random-effects meta-analysis.
GRADE and ’Summary of findings’ table
The original review and analyses were conducted prior to the use
of GRADE and ’Summary of findings’ tables. As we identified no
new studies for inclusion in this update, we did not undertake a
GRADE assessment or create a ’Summary of findings’ table. We
made this decision based on time and resource constraints of the
author group. The update status is now ’Up to date > No new
studies identified with search’.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We carried out a subgroup analysis comparing studies using a
placebo control or active treatment.

 Sensitivity analysis
We included only studies that limited enrolment to people with
a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis or acute productive cough
for the primary analysis. We did a sensitivity analysis that included
unpublisheddatafromsubgroupsof participantswith aproductive
cough and non-purulent tracheobronchitis from two studies that
enrolled people with an influenza-like illness or a common cold
(Howie 1970; Kaiser 1996).

Description of studies
Results of the search
The updated and modified CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and
LILACS searchesin 2017 yielded an additional 993 titles. We have
identified no new studies since the 2014 update. All of the 17 trials
included in the primary analysis enrolled people with a diagnosis
of acute cough or acute lower respiratory tract infection. In one
study participants were required to produce a sputum sample for
analysis as a condition of enrolment (Franks 1984).
Included studies
We included 17 studies in this review. We identified no new stud-
ies for this update. The 2014 update added two new studies (Little
2013; Llor 2013). These were important additions, particularly
the trial by Little 2013, as it is the largest trial conducted to date,
involving 2061 participants recruited across 12 countries. Partic-
ipants were randomised to receive either amoxicillin or placebo,
and there was low risk of bias with more than 80% follow-up of
participants.
Most studies used clinical findings to exclude patients thought to
have pneumonia. Four studies included chest radiographs in their
protocols: two performed a chest film on all potential participants
(Brickfield 1986; Nduba 2008), and in the other two, Scherl 1987
did so on people with rales or fever, and Llor 2013 did so on those
with suspected pneumonia (7 of 416 participants). These four
studies excluded those with radiological evidence of pneumonia
or tuberculosis. One study excluded people with any abnormality
noted on examination of the chest (Stott 1976). Four trials also
excluded people with a clinical syndrome suggesting sinusitis (
Dunlay 1987; King 1996; Verheij 1994; Williamson 1984).
In all trials the duration of illness at entry was less than 30 days.
One trial limited enrolment to people who were ill for less than
one week (Stott 1976), and in five trials the duration was two
weeks or less (Brickfield 1986; Evans 2002; Franks 1984; King
1996; Matthys 2000).
Eight of the trials included only adults (Brickfield 1986; Dunlay
1987; Hueston 1994; Little 2013; Llor2013; Nduba 2008;Verheij
1994; Williamson 1984). The remaining studies included both
adolescents and adults (Franks 1984; Scherl 1987; Stott 1976);
people aged three years or older (Little 2005); or eight years or
older (King 1996).
Regarding antibiotic treatment, four trials used doxycycline (
Scherl 1987; Stott 1976; Verheij 1994; Williamson 1984), four
erythromycin (Brickfield 1986; Dunlay 1987; Hueston 1994;
King 1996), one trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Franks 1984),
one azithromycin (Evans 2002), one cefuroxime (Matthys 2000),
one amoxicillin or erythromycin (Little 2005), two amoxicillin
(Little 2013; Nduba 2008), and one amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
(Llor 2013).
The majority of studies used a single reassessment visit to evaluate
results of the intervention. The timing of this visit varied from
study to study, ranging from two to 14 days after the initiation
of treatment. Some investigators also asked participants to keep
symptom diaries, which were used to determine the duration of
symptoms or disability.
Several of the trials provided results of separate analyses of one or
more subsets of patients based on characteristics such as cigarette
smoking, patient age, duration of symptoms, presence of purulent
sputum, or illness severity. All participants enrolled in the study
by Nduba 2008 were tested for HIV and a sub-group analysis was
undertaken based on HIV status. The largest study included in
the review, (Little 2013), was adequately powered for a subgroup
analysis of participants aged over 60 years.
For the sensitivity analyses, we included unpublished data from
two trials. In one (Howie 1970), participants began self treatment
with dimethyl chlortetracycline or placebo if a cold or influenza-
like illness did not spontaneously resolve after two days. We in-
cluded data from a subgroup of participants who had a productive
cough prior to beginning treatment. The other study randomised
participants with the common cold to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
or placebo (Kaiser 1996). We included data from a subgroup of
participants who had a concomitant diagnosis of non-purulent
tracheobronchitis, which incorporates ’acute bronchitis’. Further
details on the subgroups of participants included from these stud-
ies is provided in the Characteristics of included studies table.
Excluded studies
We excluded studies for a variety of reasons based on study design
and intervention criteria. Details of excluded studies are provided
in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
Risk of bias in included studies
Sixteen of the 17 included trials were randomised, double- or sin-
gle-blind evaluations comparing an antibiotic with a placebo. The
8

 study added in the 2011 update was the first equivalence ran-
domised controlled trial included in the review (Nduba 2008).
The earlier study by Little 2005 involved three arms comparing
immediate antibiotictherapy, noactive treatment, ordelayedtreat-
ment; we only included the two arms comparing immediate an-
tibiotic treatment with no treatment. The study by Llor 2013, in-
volved three arms comparing antibiotic, placebo, and anti-inflam-
matory treatment; we only included data from the antibiotic versus
placebo arms. Four reports did not clearly state the randomisation
method used (Brickfield 1986; Howie 1970; Kaiser 1996; Scherl
1987). Only one of the articles reported a formal evaluation of
the effectiveness of the blinding procedures used (Nduba 2008).
Six studies measured compliance or adherence with treatment: in
five, there were no differences in the number of pills taken in
the antibiotic and placebo groups (Dunlay 1987; Hueston 1994;
Little 2013; Nduba 2008; Stott 1976); in the study by King 1996,
94% of the participants who returned for follow-up took at least
one-half of their pills, and Little 2013 reported greater than 90%
adherence in both groups by day five. Regarding co-interventions
with other medications, four trials asked participants to record the
use of non-prescription medications and included this as an out-
come measure (Dunlay 1987; Franks 1984; Hueston 1994; King
1996); one trial restricted use to aspirin and acetaminophen, but
did not have the participants record this (Scherl 1987); and one
trial reported adjunctive prescriptions, but not use of over-the-
counter medications (Verheij 1994). The majority of studies (13
out of 17) followed up more than 80% of participants (details of
dropouts are provided in the Characteristics of included studies
table). In some cases, no information about withdrawals was avail-
able in the paper or from the authors. However, when informa-
tion was available, we included outcome data from the last point
at which the participants remained in the study. To the greatest
degree possible, we analysed participants on an intention-to-treat
basis.
The overall risk of bias is presented graphically in Figure 1 and
summarised in Figure 2.
Allocation
In general, there was minimal risk of allocation or selection bias: 15
out of 17 studies clearly reported adequate allocation concealment.
Blinding
In general, there was minimal risk of bias relating to lack of blind-
ing, with 14 out of 17 studies clearly reporting adequate blinding
of outcome assessors.
Incomplete outcome data
The majority of studies had adequate completion of outcome data
with minimal risk of attrition bias.
Selective reporting
Most trials evaluated several different outcome measures. In some
cases, the published reports included detailed data for only those
outcomes found to be statistically significant. To minimise this
reporting bias, we attempted to obtain additional data from the
trial authors; five authors provided this information (Howie 1970;
Hueston 1994; Kaiser 1996; King 1996; Williamson 1984). How-
ever, we were still unable to include data from Stott 1976 for the
outcomes of cough, night cough, or activity limitations at follow-
up, which were reported in the published trial as being not signif-
icantly different between groups.
Other potential sources of bias
The main concern regarding bias was the relatively small numbers
of studies that could be included in individual meta-analyses. We
have attempted to address this by adding a new, broader analysis
reflecting clinical improvement. This has been further strength-
ened by the addition of the largest multi country trial to date
(Little 2013). There were no additional concerns regarding other
potential sources of bias.
Effects of interventions
All studies did not report the same outcome measures. Some stud-
ies reported the presence or absence of various symptoms and
signs at a follow-up visit; others reported the mean duration of
symptoms; and still others reported only unique symptom scores.
In addition, in some studies explicit data were available only for
outcomes that were significantly different between the antibiotic
and placebo groups. The number of studies that provided data
for the outcomes in this review therefore ranged from three to 11.
None of the summary outcomes in the primary analysis exhib-
ited statistically significant heterogeneity apart from the analysis
of participants ’clinically improved’. Numbers of studies and par-
ticipants included in the individual meta-analyses were generally
small, although the meta-analysis for ’clinically improved’ includes
11 studies, and the meta-analysis for adverse events includes 12
studies.
Primary outcomes
1. Cough-related outcomes
At the follow-up visit, participants given antibiotics were less likely
to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, risk ratio (RR)
0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number needed
to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) (Analysis
1.1; Figure 3) or a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants,
RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) (Analysis 2.1). The dif-
ferences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and days

 of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibi-
otic-treated participants only had a significant reduction in mean
duration of cough when the study by Little 2005, which had a no-
treatment comparison group, was excluded (Figure 4). Llor 2013
also reported no significant difference in median days of cough
between the antibiotic and placebo groups. In addition, sensitiv-
ity analysis altered the outcome of mean duration of productive
cough, which was significantly reduced if the Howie 1970 study
relating to upper respiratory tract infection was excluded.

2. Global assessment of improvement by clinicians at follow-
up: ’clinically improved’
For the 2011 update of the review, we added an analysis that in-
cluded a broader outcome ’clinically improved’, so that as many
studies as possible could be included in a meta-analysis. This was
10

 particularly important following the inclusion of the Nduba 2008
study in 2011, which was of high quality, included a large number
of participants, and showed no benefit from antibiotic use. This
outcome includes additional data from the authors of the largest
included study, (Little 2013). The data from Little 2013 are based
on numbers of participants no longer reporting their symptoms
being “moderately bad” at one week. The published study presents
mean symptom severity scores in the first few days, which indi-
cated no significant difference between the intervention and con-
trol groups (Little 2013). This outcome reflects the proportions
of participants with clinical improvement and incorporates ’cure’
as measured by a greater than 75% reduction in the Acute Bron-
chitis Severity Score (Nduba 2008), global improvement or be-
ing well (Brickfield 1986; Llor 2013; Matthys 2000; Stott 1976;
Verheij 1994; Williamson 1984), patient report of no limitations
(Dunlay 1987; Evans 2002; Franks 1984), and resolution of symp-
toms rated as moderately bad, severe, or worsening (Little 2013).
This analysis includes 11 studies involving 3841 participants and
shows no statistically significant difference between groups (RR
1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; NNTB 22) (Analysis 6.1; Figure 5).
The addition of data from Little 2013 and Llor 2013 increased the
heterogeneity for this analysis. A sensitivity analysis removing the
studies reporting ’no limitation’ made no difference to this result.

Forest plot of comparison: Clinically improved, outcome: number of participants reporting no
limitations or described as cured/well/symptoms resolved or globally improved.
3. General clinical outcomes
Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in the number
of days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, mean difference
(MD) -0.64, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) (Analysis 8.1; Figure 6) and
a reduction in days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767
participants, MD -0.49, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04) (Analysis 9.1).
There was no significant difference in proportions of participants
with activity limitations at follow-up. Participants on antibiotics
were more likely to be improved according to clinician’s global
assessment(6studieswith 891participants,RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48
to 0.79; NNTB 11) (Analysis 10.1; Figure 7) and were less likely to
have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR
0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6) (Analysis 11.1). Additional
clinical outcomes were reported by Little 2013, who found no
significant difference in mean symptom severity scores on days two
to four (intervention score 1.62 (standard deviation (SD) 0.84)
versus control score 1.69 (SD 0.84), P = 0.07), and Evans 2002
found that azithromycin had no benefit in terms of health-related
quality of life at day three and day seven follow-up. Llor 2013
also reported no difference in time to overall symptom resolution
between groups.

Secondary outcomes
1. Adverse effects
With four exceptions (Brickfield 1986; Little 2005; Matthys 2000;
Nduba 2008), all of the studies found that participants in the an-
tibiotic group reported more adverse effects than participants re-
ceivingaplacebo(Figure 8). The RRof adverse effectsinthe antibi-

The most commonly reported side effects included gastrointesti-
nal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea. Headaches,
skin rash, and vaginitis also occurred. Side effects seemed to be
mild, as only 0% to 13% (overall 3.7%) of participants withdrew
because of them, and no deaths were reported.

Forest plot of comparison: Number of participants with adverse effects.
Subgroups
We were not able to obtain enough explicit data from the studies
for various patient subgroups, therefore we did not carry out any
sensitivity analyses based on patient characteristics (such as age,
duration of illness, or smoking status). Little 2013 was adequately
powered to assess the effect in the subgroup of participants aged
over 60 and found no significant benefit in this group. The results
in the individual studies for subgroup analyses were mixed. In one
trial, all of the significantly improved outcomes from antibiotics
occurred in non-smokers (Brickfield 1986). The other seven tri-
als reported that they found no differences in antibiotic effective-
ness between smokers and non-smokers, but included no data on
these comparisons in their published reports. Verheij 1994, using
multiple regression, found that two subsets of patients were more
likely to improve with doxycycline than placebo: participants over
55 years and those with very frequent cough who felt ill. Scherl
1987 found that only participants without coryza or sore throat
had fewer days of cough or sputum with doxycycline. The only
study to use Gram stains reported an earlier return to work for
participants with a positive Gram stain who were treated with an-
tibiotics (Franks 1984). Nduba 2008 also examined whether the
use of amoxicillin was more effective than placebo in people who
had tested positive for HIV and found no difference, though all
participants had received a chest X-ray and those with any abnor-
13

 mal signs were excluded.
Little 2005, which was added to the 2009 update, found no signif-
icant difference in outcomes between groups treated with imme-
diate antibiotics compared with no antibiotic treatment. As this
study did not involve a placebo control we included it in the anal-
yses, where appropriate data were available, as a subgroup to high-
light this difference. The one study added in the 2011 update was
powered to detect equivalence between antibiotic and placebo and
foundnosignificantdifference (Nduba 2008). Infact, the pointes-
timates favoured placebo treatment (84% cured on placebo versus
82.4% cured on amoxicillin). The largest included study, which
was added in the 2014 update, was included in the ’clinically im-
proved’ and adverse effects meta-analyses (Little 2013).

Summary of main results
We found mixed results across studies, with some suggesting mar-
ginal benefits for antibiotics, which are however of doubtful clin-
ical significance. The inclusion of the largest multicentre study
of the effectiveness of antibiotics in people with lower respiratory
tract infections strengthens the evidence and also highlights a sta-
tistically significant increase in adverse events in the antibiotic-
treated groups. However, it is possible that older patients with
multimorbidity may not have been recruited to trials, so the ev-
idence guiding decision-making in this group of patients is less
certain.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
In general, the available evidence suggests we should not be using
antibiotics to treat acute bronchitis or lower respiratory tract infec-
tions when pneumonia is not expected. There is a modest benefit
from antibiotics for some outcomes, but these are of minimal clin-
ical significance. Any benefit is even less apparent in the sensitivity
analysis, which included data from subgroups of patients with pro-
ductive cough of short duration (two to four days) in conjunction
with the common cold. Of the two trials in the primary analysis
that limited enrolment to people who had been ill for less than
one week, one did not show any benefit from antibiotics (Stott
1976), whilst the other showed modest benefit from antibiotics
(Matthys 2000).
It is possible that the overall benefit noted from antibiotics re-
sulted from the inclusion in some trials of people who may have
had pneumonia instead of acute bronchitis. There was variation
between studies as to whether chest X-rays were conducted as part
of the evaluations. Only one trial obtained chest radiographs on all
participants and then excluded those whose films were consistent
with pneumonia (Brickfield 1986). In Little 2013, a positive chest
X-ray was not an automatic exclusion criterion, although some
participants dropped out following such a finding. All of the re-
maining studies either excluded or obtained chest radiographs in
patients with clinical findings of suspected pneumonia (which in
most studies were focal findings on chest examination). Individual
signs (such as crackles or fever) are not sensitive (Metlay 1997a),
therefore their absence cannot be relied on to rule out pneumonia.
On the other hand, since the prevalence of pneumonia in outpa-
tients who present with cough is generally low (less than 5% in
the USA) (Metlay 1997b), it is unlikely that a significant number
of participants in these trials had pneumonia. In addition, this
review was designed to test the effectiveness of treatment for acute
bronchitis in clinical practice, and it is not standard practice to
confirm the diagnosis of acute bronchitis with a chest X-ray un-
less there is a clinical suspicion of underlying pneumonia. Had we
only included studies with chest X-ray confirmation of diagnosis,
it would have limited the generalisability of the review findings.
Quality of the evidence
Since there is no gold standard test, the diagnosis of acute bronchi-
tis must be made on clinical grounds. All of the trials excluded peo-
ple with chronic pulmonary disease and enrolled participants with
recent onset of a respiratory illness with a productive cough. The
results of the studies in the primary analysis that included partici-
pants with a productive cough, without specifically stating that the
participants had acute bronchitis, were similar to the studies that
used this specific terminology, as one showed some benefits from
antibiotics (Verheij 1994), and one did not (Stott 1976). Clini-
cal characteristics of participants regarding the duration of illness
and associated symptoms and physical findings did vary somewhat
among studies, but were consistent with definitions generally used
by primary care physicians (Oeffinger 1997; Verheij 1990). These
results would therefore appear to be generalisable to the manage-
ment of acute bronchitis in community practices.
Potential biases in the review process
This review may also be subject to bias because although we have
now included 17 trials and 5099 participants, it is possible that
some patient subgroups are under-represented, as they may not
have been recruited into the original trials. Little 2013 points out
that while they included a large sample of older people, more
severely ill older people with multimorbidities were unlikely to
have been approached to participate in the trial, and in these types
of patients their results should be interpreted with caution; this
applies to the review results also.

 Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
In the current update of the review we have included a large multi
country trial that shows no benefits from antibiotics even in older
patients. Further analyses of the data from this study are ongoing
as part of Workpackage 10 of the GRACE program (www.grace-
lrti.org). It should be noted that a recent large observational study
examining symptom resolution in 2714 people with acute cough
who had been prescribed amoxicillin across 13 European countries
found that symptom resolution was quicker in those receiving no
antibiotic (Butler 2010).

Implications for practice
This review confirms the impression of clinicians that antibiotics
have limited, if any, beneficial effects in acute bronchitis. Where
there appear to be some benefits, they are slight (such as the small
improvement in mean duration of cough of less than one day)
and may be of questionable clinical significance. The most re-
cently published placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial
confirms these findings and was carried out in 12 countries, im-
proving the generalisability of the review findings (Little 2013).
Another recent randomised controlled trial included also showed
no difference in cure rates between those prescribed amoxicillin
and those given placebo (Nduba 2008). This trial was particularly
important as it was set in a low-income country and may increase
the generalisability of the review. However, the inclusion of a range
of trials in different settings does also increase heterogeneity.
While this review suggests limited if any clinical benefit from
antibiotics, one could argue for prescribing antibiotics for acute
bronchitis because studies of patient utilities for antibiotic treat-
ment for respiratory infections suggest that even small benefits are
seen as important by some patients (Herman 1984), and because
the adverse effects associated with antibiotic treatment are minor
and disappear when the medication is discontinued. On the other
hand, arguments against prescribing antibiotics can be made be-
cause the modest benefits from antibiotics may not outweigh their
costs, adverse effects, or negative consequences on antibiotic resis-
tance patterns and patient expectations.
It is likely that, as with other respiratory infections (Dagnelie 1996;
Kaiser 1996), antibiotics may be only effective for a subset of pa-
tients with acute bronchitis. It seems that patients who have other
typical symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection and who
have been ill for less than one week may be the least likely to ben-
efit from antibiotics. A large cohort study within the UK General
Practice Research Database indicates that the risk of pneumonia
as a complication of lower respiratory tract infection is substan-
tially reduced in elderly patients when antibiotics are prescribed
immediately (Petersen 2007). However, a likely confounding fac-
tor in this study was the fact that sicker patients and those more
likely to suffer complications were offered immediate antibiotics,
introducing potential bias (Coenen 2007). Another analysis of ex-
isting data suggests that reducing antibiotic prescribing for acute
respiratory tract infections in primary care settings by 10% would
be associated with one extra case of pneumonia per general practi-
tioner every four to five years (Del Mar 2016). The trials that have
been performed to date do not offer a clear method to differentiate
patients with acute bronchitis who might benefit from antibiotic
therapy from those who might not. In light of this uncertainty, it
is especially important for clinicians to share the decision about
whether to use antibiotics or not with their patients, using the
expected outcomes and their magnitude from this review as a basis
for their discussion.
In terms of interventions designed to reduce unnecessary antibi-
otic prescribing, some organisational and educational strategies
have been shown to be helpful. Use of delayed or deferred an-
tibiotic when patients consult with symptoms of acute bronchitis
is of some value (Dowell 2001). In a randomised trial in 22 UK
practices, 191 patients were randomised to either immediate or
delayed antibiotic (prescription lodged at the family practice re-
ception and patients were invited to collect it after one week, if
required). Over half (55%) in the delayed arm did not pick up
their prescriptions, though compared to the participants in the
immediate arm, they were less satisfied with this strategy (Dowell
2001). In a randomised trial of a patient information leaflet in 212
patients with acute bronchitis for whom antibiotics were judged to
be unnecessary by their family doctor, the leaflet reduced uptake
comparedtothose withoutanyinformation(49% versus63%, risk
ratio 0.76) (Macfarlane 2002). This review contains a subgroup
of patients from a UK trial that tested the effectiveness of three
prescribing strategies and an information leaflet for acute lower
respiratory tract infections (Little 2005). The authors concluded
that no offer or a delayed offer of antibiotics for acute uncom-
plicated lower respiratory tract infection is acceptable and is asso-
ciated with little difference in symptom resolution. The authors
argue that the strategy of delayed or no prescribing is very likely to
reduce antibiotic use and beliefs in the effectiveness of antibiotics
for this condition. A recent review concluded that complex inter-
ventions that included education for physicians were most likely
to be effective in optimising antibiotic prescribing in primary care
settings (van der Velden 2012).
Implications for research
There is a widespread belief among clinicians and patients that
antibiotics provide effective treatment for acute bronchitis. There
is also widespread opinion among experts that antibiotic therapy is
unwarranted in this condition. The results of this review indicate
that there are, at most, limited benefits for some patients, and this
must be placed in the context of the significant increase in adverse
15

 events in the antibiotic group. However, it is also possible that any
apparent benefits from antibiotics are overestimated.
Ongoing research efforts should also be directed at the identifi-
cation of subsets of patients who are most likely or least likely
to benefit from antibiotic treatment (Coenen 2007; Little 2013).
Patient age, duration and severity of illness, chest examination
findings, sputum Gram stains, C-reactive protein levels (Jonsson
1997), and cigarette smoking are variables that may be important
in differentiation of these patient subsets. The ongoing GRACE
programme (Genomics to Combat Resistance Against Antibiotics
in Community-Acquired Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in
Europe, www.grace-lrti.org) may provide answers to some of these
questions (Coenen 2007). Given the controversy around the term
’acute bronchitis’, it will also be important for researchers to be
very clear on their inclusion criteria to allow comparison across
studies. Finally, given the small impact, at best, of antibiotics on
patient symptoms, investigators should continue the search for
other effective means of relieving the most troublesome symptoms
of people suffering from acute bronchitis.

monitoring and safety committee because “outcomes were equivalent and there was suf-
ficient precision to be confident that the likelihood of detecting a clinically meaningful
difference with a larger sample was so small that continued enrolment of patients would
be inappropriate”

Characteristics of excluded studies [ordered by study ID]
Study
Reason for exclusion
Batieha 2002
185 participants with acute respiratory tract infection from 2 health centres in Jordan. Assignment to antibiotic
(azithromycin) was by means of alternation, not randomisation. At follow-up of 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks,
participants administered azithromycin or placebo did similarly in terms of the proportions improved or cured
and duration of illness. The authors of the study concluded that routine use of antibiotics (azithromycin) in
acute respiratory tract infection is unlikely to alter the course of the illness
Christ-Crain 2004
Randomised controlled trial concerned with application of a diagnostic test (serum calcitonin precursor, procal-
citonin) that is raised in bacterial infections. 243 people admitted to hospital with suspected lower respiratory
tract infections were randomly assigned to standard care (n = 119) or procalcitonin-guided treatment (n = 124)
. On the basis of serum procalcitonin concentrations, use of antibiotics was more or less discouraged (< 0.1 µg/
L or < 0.25 µg/L) or encouraged (≥ 0.5 µg/L or ≥ 0.25 µg/L), respectively. Re-evaluation was possible after
6 to 24 hours in both groups. Primary endpoint was use of antibiotics. 59 (24%) participants had diagnosis
of “acute bronchitis”. Antibiotic use decreased in the procalcitonin group. Withholding antibiotic treatment
based on procalcitonin measurement did not compromise patient outcome
Dowell 2001
Randomised controlled trial of “delayed” versus “immediate” antibiotics for acute cough. Participants ran-
domised to “delayed” arm were asked to wait a week before collecting their prescription. 55% of participants
did not pick up their prescription. More participants were satisfied and “enabled” in the immediate-treatment
arm
Gordon 1974
Participants were children with “symptoms referable to the respiratory tract”, therefore likely many had upper
respiratory infections (78% to 96% had runny nose, 74% to 83% had inflamed nasal mucosa)
Gottfarb 1994
Post-randomisation exclusion of 23% of the sample due to laboratory evidence of pertussis infection. Outcomes
not clearly reported
Stephenson 1989
Participants were adults with upper respiratory infection. Not all had cough, and no information available on
the subgroup of patients with productive cough
Thomas 1978
Explicit data from the study were not published and the data are no longer available

Data reported on adverse effects, 21 May 2005
Summary
We would like to draw attention to the misleading statement of authors conclusions for this review. The authors conclusion in the
abstract reads: “Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis.
THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS BENEFIT, HOWEVER, IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE DETRIMENT FROM POTENTIAL
ADVERSE EFFECTS.”
The data reported on adverse effects does not seem to support this conclusion.
Graph 07 showing the number of participants with adverse effects in the antibiotics and control groups illustrates that adverse events
in the antibiotics group reach significance in just one small study (King 1996), and the non-significant pooled estimate is clearly stated
in the results section: “The overall relative risk (RR) of adverse effects was 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).”
We would like to recommend that the authors amend their conclusions to take account of these comments.

Reply
We accept that our conclusions are overly pessimistic about side effects from antibiotic therapy. The pooled results from the updated
review changed after inclusion of an additional RCT (Matthys 2000, see Figure 8 of the review), making adverse events less likely. We
acknowledge that we did not change the tone of our conclusions to reflect this greater uncertainty concerning side effects.
We have amended the conclusion in the abstract to reflect the updated results concerning side effects to the following sentence:

 “The magnitude of this benefit, however, needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a
self-limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens and cost of antibiotic treatment.”

Correction to updated review, 1 May 2008
Summary
Dear Authors,
Compared to the version published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2002, issue 2, the current version of the review
included two more studies (Matthys, 2000; Evans, 2003). By consequence, some comparisons (02, 04-07) were updated. Therefore,
the abstract should start with “Eleven studies involving over 1250 patients” instead of “Nine trials involving over 750”. But, more
importantly, except for comparison 07: Adverse effects, the values of the comparisons already mentioned in the abstract still need to
be adjusted, i.e. 05: Not improved by physician’s global assessment at follow-up visit (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.30,0.65; NNT 10; 95% CI
...) instead of (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31,0.85; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50);06: Abnormal lung exam at follow-up visit (RR 0.54; 95% CI
0.41,0.70; NNT 6; 95% CI ...) instead of (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26,0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); Finally, due to the inclusion of
(Matthys, 2000) comparison 02: Night cough at follow-up visit, now shows a significant difference between antibiotics and placebo(RR
0.67; 95% CI 0.54,0.83; NNT 7 ; 95% CI ...) instead of (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.45,1.30). This comparison should thus be removed
from the statement starting with “There were nog significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, ...”
and added to the previous sentence showing the benefits of antibiotic treatment. Given the difficulties in distinguishing upper from
lower respiratory tract infections in daily practice and given the results of the study by Little et al. mentioned as ongoing study, the
conclusions are still justified.
With kind regards
Samuel Coenen

Thank you for your comments regarding inconsistencies noted in the previous update of the review. The review has been updated again
over the last nine months and these inconsistencies were noted and corrected. The Little study has since been published and is now
incorporated in this new version of the review.

 Antibiotics for acute bronchitis, 22 June 2016
Summary
We have read your 2014 Cochrane review CD000245 “Antibiotics in Acute Bronchitis” in detail with interest and noticed two points:
1. In the published version on the Cochrane Library homepage we are not able to see Figure 1, which unfortunately seems to be missing
in the document.
2. There seems to be a data-reference disorder:
In the text on page 12 concerning additional cases of adverse events it is written “NNT = 5, RR = 1.20 (1.05 to 1.36)”, but in the
abstract this is citated “NNT = 24, RR = 1.20 (1.05 to 1.36)”; ie the same RR-value and 95% CI, but very different NNT.

Reply
Regarding comment 1: Figure 1 has been reported to the Cochrane Library publishers and we have sought assistance to resolve this
and move the Figure to the correct section.
Regarding comment 2: the NNT in the text was an error - I have corrected this.

Review updated and strengthens the conclusion sug-
gesting no evidence to support use of antibiotics in
people with acute bronchitis. The analysis of adverse
effects has been updated by the addition of data from
the largest study conducted to date and now indicates
a statistically significant rate of adverse effects in the
antibiotic-treated groups

New search has been performed
Updated search Issue 4, 2000. We found no additional
trials, but we were able to obtain unpublished data
from three trials that were not included in the origi-
nal review. The trials were not included in the original
review because the participants in the trials as a whole
did not meet our inclusion criteria. However, the trials
each contained a subgroup of patients that did meet
our inclusion criteria. We were also able to obtain ad-
ditional unpublished data from some of the originally
included trials
