BACKGROUND
Detailed neuropathological information on the structural brain lesions underlying 
seizures is valuable for understanding drug-resistant focal epilepsy.
METHODS
We report the diagnoses made on the basis of resected brain specimens from 9523 
patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for drug-resistant seizures in 36 centers 
from 12 European countries over 25 years. Histopathological diagnoses were de-
termined through examination of the specimens in local hospitals (41%) or at the 
German Neuropathology Reference Center for Epilepsy Surgery (59%).
RESULTS
The onset of seizures occurred before 18 years of age in 75.9% of patients overall, 
and 72.5% of the patients underwent surgery as adults. The mean duration of 
epilepsy before surgical resection was 20.1 years among adults and 5.3 years 
among children. The temporal lobe was involved in 71.9% of operations. There 
were 36 histopathological diagnoses in seven major disease categories. The most 
common categories were hippocampal sclerosis, found in 36.4% of the patients 
(88.7% of cases were in adults), tumors (mainly ganglioglioma) in 23.6%, and 
malformations of cortical development in 19.8% (focal cortical dysplasia was the 
most common type, 52.7% of cases of which were in children). No histopatho-
logical diagnosis could be established for 7.7% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy requiring surgery, hippocampal scle-
rosis was the most common histopathological diagnosis among adults, and focal 
cortical dysplasia was the most common diagnosis among children. Tumors were 
the second most common lesion in both groups. (Funded by the European Union 
and others.)

Findings in Brain Tissue Obtained during Epilepsy Surgery
I
n 2015, the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) recognized epilepsy as a serious 
public health concern. Approximately 50 mil-
lion people worldwide currently have epilepsy,1 
and more than 30% of patients with epilepsy 
have inadequate seizure control with drug ther-
apy.2,3 Epilepsy surgery is appropriate for carefully 
selected patients with difficult-to-treat focal epi-
lepsy,4-6 and successful epilepsy surgery reduces 
mortality in this population.7 Although the efficacy 
of epilepsy surgery has been established in retro-
spective series from tertiary epilepsy centers,8-13 
few of these studies have extensively explored the 
types of underlying pathologic brain lesions.
The European Epilepsy Brain Bank (EEBB) was 
established in 2006 under the direction of the 
Framework Program of the European Union to 
standardize histopathological reporting of spec-
imens obtained during epilepsy surgery and to 
survey epileptogenic brain lesions. The EEBB col-
lects a prespecified minimal data set of deidenti-
fied clinicopathological information for its data-
base in accordance with this plan. The inception 
of the database also prompted the International 
League against Epilepsy (ILAE) to develop an in-
ternational classification of clinicopathological 
subtypes of focal cortical dysplasia14 and of sub-
types of hippocampal sclerosis.15 These standard-
ized consensus classifications of specimens ob-
tained during epilepsy surgery inform the study 
of epilepsy, which had previously relied on clinical 
series and small randomized trials for data on the 
underlying causes of seizures.4-6 We present the 
histopathological diagnoses from the large EEBB 
database to complement existing information on 
drug-resistant epilepsy and epilepsy surgery.
Methods
Study Procedures
We examined specimens from the EEBB data-
base, which includes 4944 men and 4579 women 
with surgically treated epilepsy who underwent 
surgery during the period from 1990 through 
2014 in 36 specialized epilepsy surgery centers 
in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, 
Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, 
Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). 
Histopathological review of resected brain tissue 
was performed at local epilepsy centers and at 
the German Neuropathology Reference Center for 
Epilepsy Surgery in Erlangen, Germany. There was 
no systematic verification of diagnoses among 
centers, but the material was interpreted by ex-
perienced neuropathologists. For patients who 
underwent two or more resections, we used 
clinical data and histopathological diagnoses 
from the last surgical procedure. Before surgery, 
all patients had undergone a detailed clinical 
examination, electroencephalographic (EEG) in-
vestigation, and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) of the head. Video EEG, neuropsychological 
and psychiatric testing, and functional imaging 
or invasive EEG were performed when clinically 
indicated and as was customary for each center.
The study was approved by the ethics review 
board of the University of Erlangen, and all pro-
cedures were conducted in accordance with the 
ethics requirements of the contributing centers. 
Written informed consent for the use of histo-
pathological data was obtained from patients or 
their representative. Participating centers sub-
mitted the histopathological diagnosis of each 
specimen with a prespecified minimal clinical 
data set that included the patient’s age at the 
onset of epilepsy, the patient’s age at the time of 
surgery (with children defined as patients whose 
age was <18 years), duration of epilepsy before 
surgery (with dates rounded to whole year num-
bers), sex, side of lesion (left, right, or midline 
[i.e., hypothalamus]), location of the lesion (tem-
poral, frontal, parietal, occipital, multilobar [in-
cluding hemispheric], or midline [i.e., hypothala-
mus]), year of surgery, and histopathological 
diagnosis based on light-microscopic inspection 
of paraffin-embedded tissue stained with hema-
toxylin and eosin or additional histochemical 
staining and immunohistological methods when 
indicated.16 Hippocampal sclerosis was defined 
histopathologically as segmental neuronal cell loss 
in anatomical sectors of the cornu ammonis of 
the hippocampus, as specified in the consensus 
classification of the ILAE.15 Brain tumors were 
classified according to the WHO classification 
of tumors of the central nervous system.17 Focal 
cortical dysplasia was defined according to the 
consensus classification system of the ILAE.14
A post hoc analysis of associations between 
histopathological diagnoses and the outcome of 
surgery was performed for a subset of the cen-
ters. We classified patients as seizure-free or not 
seizure-free on the basis of information obtained 
12 months after surgery. Freedom from seizures 
corresponded to category IA in the Engel clas-

sification (classes range from IA [completely 
seizure-free] to IVC [worsened seizures]18) and 
was equivalent to category 1 in the ILAE classi-
fication system (scores range from 1 [completely 
seizure-free with no auras] to 6 [>100% increase 
in seizure days from baseline]19).
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed differences among the seven histo-
pathological categories in age at onset of seizures 
(<18 years vs. ≥18 years) and the side of the af-
fected hemisphere, which resulted in 28 tests; 
we used Bonferroni adjustment with P≤0.0017 
(i.e., P<[0.05 
÷ 
28]) considered to indicate statis-
tical significance.20 Differences between groups 
were assessed with the use of an independent-
sample t-test for continuous variables and a chi-
square test for categorical data. Results that are 
not accompanied by statistical analyses are de-
scriptive only of numerical differences between 
groups. Statistics were analyzed with the use of 
SPSS Statistics 23 (IBM).
Results
Patients and Specimens
Resected brain tissue for histopathological re-
view was available for 3901 patients (41.0%) at lo-
cal epilepsy centers and for 5622 patients (59.0%) 
at the German Neuropathology Reference Center 
for Epilepsy Surgery in Erlangen, Germany. A to-
tal of 367 patients (3.8%) underwent two or more 
resections; for these patients, we used clinical 
data and histopathological diagnoses from the last 
surgical procedure. The prespecified minimal clin-
ical data set was 97.5% complete for the overall 
series, with 1936 data points missing, in most 
cases for side of surgery, year of surgery, or ana-
tomical localization. Of the 36 centers, 20 reported 
seizure outcomes after surgery for 85.2 to 100.0% 
of their patients, and these data were used for 
the post hoc analysis of associations between 
histopathological diagnoses and the outcome of 
surgery. Information on seizure outcomes from 
these 20 centers was available for 5248 patients 
at 1 year after surgery and for an additional 1920 
patients at 24 months; this sample represented 
98.4% of the 7286 patients for whom any out-
come data were available, or 75.3% of the total 
patients in the series. In the 20 centers from 
which information was used for post hoc analy-
sis of surgical outcomes, antiepileptic drug treat-
ment was continued after surgery in all adults 
and in more than 90% of children.
At the time of surgery, 6900 (72.5%) of the 
patients were adults and 2623 (27.5%) were chil-
dren. A total of 51.9% of patients were male 
(Table 1). Seizure onset occurred in childhood 
(<18 years of age) in 75.9% of the patients, and 
seizures started earlier than 6 years of age in 
36%. The region operated on was the temporal 
lobe in 71.9% of the patients. Surgical resection 
was performed on the left side of the brain in 
49.1% of the patients, on the right side in 50.5%, 
and on midline structures in the remainder.
There were 36 histopathological diagnoses 
(Table 2, and Tables S2 through S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix) that could be classified into 
seven major conventional categories (Table 3). 
The 10 most frequent histopathological diagno-
ses accounted for 86.7% of cases. Among the 
7168 patients for whom reporting of postsurgi-
cal outcome was available, post hoc analysis in-
dicated that 60.7% (66.4% of children and 58.6% 
of adults) were seizure-free 1 year after surgery 
(ILAE score of 1, Engel class IA).
Hippocampal Sclerosis
Hippocampal sclerosis was the most common 
histopathological diagnosis; this condition was 
identified in 36.4% of all surgical specimens —

Findings in Brain Tissue Obtained during Epilepsy Surgery
44.5% of those from adults and 15.0% of those 
from children (Table 3, and Tables S3 and S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Hippocampal scle-
rosis was diagnosed in 54.4% of specimens ob-
tained from the temporal lobe (Fig. 1A, 1B, and 
1C).15 A second histopathological diagnosis was 
made in 1.5% of specimens with hippocampal 
sclerosis, including ganglioglioma (25.2%), glial 
scars (23.7%), focal cortical dysplasia (8.6%), 
dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (8.6%), 
encephalitis (7.2%), and cavernous angioma 
(5.8%). The duration of epilepsy before surgery 
in patients with hippocampal sclerosis is shown 
in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
The onset of epilepsy was slightly but signifi-
cantly earlier among patients with left hippo-
campal sclerosis than among those with right 
hippocampal sclerosis (mean age [±SD], 10.7±9.8 
vs. 11.9±10.2 years; P<0.001). A relationship be-
tween the age at the onset of seizures and the 
side of the affected hemisphere was not found 
for any other histopathological category. Overall, 
the rate of freedom from seizures 1 year after 
surgery was 61.4% among patients who had the 
diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis.
Tumors
Brain tumors were the second most common 
histopathological diagnosis, occurring in 23.6% 
of specimens, with ganglioglioma (Fig. 1D, 1E, 
and 1F) being the most frequent (found in 10.4% 
of all patients in the study population). A total 
of 82.5% of gangliogliomas were located in the 
temporal lobe. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial 
tumors were the second most frequent type of 
tumor (5.9% of patients); in 68.1% of cases, this 
tumor was located in the temporal lobe. Early 
seizure onset occurred in association with both 
types of tumor, with a mean age (±SD) at onset 
of 13.1±10.7 years. Other tumors associated 
with an onset of epilepsy that occurred mainly 
before 18 years of age were angiocentric glioma, 
gangliocytoma, isomorphic astrocytoma, pilocyt-
ic astrocytoma, neurocytoma, and pleomorphic 
xanthoastrocytoma, as well as low-grade neuro-
epithelial tumors, the detailed characteristics of 
which were not further specified by the neuro-
pathologist. Most of these tumors were classi-
fied as low grade (WHO grade I), and together 
with gangliogliomas and dysembryoplastic neu-
roepithelial tumors they accounted for 79.2% of 
all tumors in this series. One year after surgery, 
68.4% of patients with tumors (79.9% of chil-
dren and 63.5% of adults) were seizure-free.
Malformations of Cortical Development
Malformations of cortical development were 
found in 19.8% of specimens and were the third

most frequent histopathological category; such 
malformations were identified in 39.3% of all 
specimens obtained from children. Subtypes of 
focal cortical dysplasia were the most common 
malformations of cortical development, account-
ing for 70.6% of cases. These malformations 
were characterized by architectural and cyto-
architectural abnormalities of the six layers of 
the cerebral cortex. The combination of dysmor-
phic neurons and balloon cells, which is charac-
teristic of focal cortical dysplasia type II (Fig. 1G, 
1H, and 1I), was the most common subtype of 
malformation (accounting for 45.3% of cases) 
and was present in 17.0% of all children in the 
series at the time of surgery (Table S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix); this malformation was 
most often located in the frontal lobe (51.6%). 
The onset of epilepsy in patients with malforma-
tions of cortical development was earlier than 
that among patients with other disease catego-
ries (Table 3). Within this group, multilobar mal-
formations were associated with the earliest onset 
of epilepsy; patients with hemimegalencephaly 
had a mean age (±SD) at onset of seizures of 
0.1±0.7 years, patients with multilobar focal 
cortical dysplasia type II a mean age at onset of 
2.3±4.3 years, and patients with polymicrogyria 
a mean age at onset of 3.3±5.5 years. Among the 
367 patients who had two or more surgical re-
sections, cortical malformations (32.2%) and tu-
mors (26.4%) were the most common conditions. 
Overall, 57.6% of patients with malformations 
of cortical development (59.9% of children and 
54.6% of adults) were seizure-free 1 year after 
surgery.
No Lesion
No specific lesion could be identified or charac-
terized by means of microscopic inspection in 
7.7% of patients (8.4% of adults and 6.1% of 
children). This included findings of nonspecific 
reactive gliosis as the only histopathologic ab-
normality in the neocortex, white matter, or 
hippocampus.14-16 Freedom from seizures 1 year 
after surgery occurred in 50.2% of patients in 
this category (55.2% of children and 48.7% of 
adults).
Vascular Lesions, Glial Scars,  
and Encephalitis
Vascular malformations were found in 6.1% of 
specimens, with cavernous angiomas in the tem-
poral lobe being the most frequent type. Seizure 
onset among patients with vascular malforma-
tions occurred at a mean age of 22.2 years, the 
oldest age among the histopathological categories. 
Freedom from seizures 1 year after surgery oc-
curred in 64.8% of patients with vascular malfor-
mations (73.0% of children and 63.4% of adults).

Figure 1. Findings from Three Patients with Conditions Commonly Diagnosed in the European Epilepsy Brain Bank.
Panel A shows a coronal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of a 51-year-old male patient with hippocampal sclerosis 
who had had right temporal lobe epilepsy since 12 years of age. The atrophic right hippocampus (enlarged in the inset) is indicated by the 
arrow. Panel B shows a 5-mm slab of en bloc resected hippocampus from the same patient, cut perpendicular to the anterior–posterior 
axis at the level of the hippocampus body. The scale bar indicates 2 mm. Panel C shows NeuN immunohistochemical staining of the 
specimen obtained from this patient (brown color with hematoxylin counterstaining) indicating segmental neuronal cell loss in cornu 
ammonis area (CA) 1 — that is, hippocampal sclerosis type 2 (2013 International League against Epilepsy [ILAE] classification). SUB de-
notes subiculum. The scale bar indicates 1 mm. Panel D shows a coronal T2-weighted MRI scan of a 13-year-old girl with ganglioglioma 
who had had right temporal lobe epilepsy since 8 years of age. The arrow points to a lesion at the right superior temporal gyrus (enlarged 
in the inset). Panel E shows a formalin-fixed en bloc resected specimen obtained from this patient, with partially cystic rarefaction of 
subcortical white matter indicated by the arrow. The scale bar indicates 4 mm. Panel F shows CD34 immunohistochemical staining of 
the specimen obtained from this patient (brown color with hematoxylin counterstaining), with diffuse tumor infiltration into adjacent 
cortex (on the right) characteristic of ganglioglioma World Health Organization (WHO) grade I (2016 WHO classification). The scale bar 
indicates 400 μm. Panel G shows a sagittal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image of a 32-year-old male patient with focal 
cortical dysplasia type II who had had left frontal lobe epilepsy since 10 years of age; the arrows point to focal cortical dysplasia with hy-
perintense transmantle sign toward the left ventricle (the enlargement in the inset was taken from an adjacent scanning level). Panel H 
shows an en bloc, formalin-fixed resected specimen obtained from this patient, with thickened and pale-colored neocortex (arrow) that 
is difficult to discriminate from white matter. The scale bar indicates 4 mm. Panel I shows immunohistochemical staining of the speci-
men obtained from this patient with monoclonal antibodies directed against nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein indicating intra-
cytoplasmic neurofilament accumulation (brown color with hematoxylin counterstaining), which is a characteristic sign of dysmorphic 
neurons in focal cortical dysplasia type II. Histopathological detection of balloon cells (not shown) further classified this lesion as sub-
type IIb (2011 ILAE classification). The scale bar indicates 70 μm.

Glial scars were found in 4.9% of specimens and 
were most often located in the temporal lobe or 
in multiple lobes (Table 3). The onset of seizures 
among patients with glial scars occurred at a 
mean age of 10.6 years, with a mean duration of 
epilepsy of 14.8 years before surgery. Glial scars 
occurred more often in men (61.0%) than in 
women (39.0%). The rate of postoperative free-
dom from seizures was numerically the lowest 
in this histopathological category (46.9%). A total 
of 1.5% of patients had a histopathological diag-
nosis of encephalitis, most commonly Rasmus-
sen’s encephalitis affecting multiple lobes. Seizure 
onset among patients with encephalitis occurred 
at a mean age of 10.1 years, and 50% of patients 
were seizure-free 1 year after surgery.
Discussion
In this series of approximately 10,000 specimens 
of brain tissue obtained during epilepsy surgery, 
the 10 most frequent histopathological diagnoses 
accounted for 86.7% of cases of drug-resistant 
epilepsy. The detailed diagnoses could be catego-
rized into seven broad categories. Hippocampal 
sclerosis was the most frequent lesion, a finding 
consistent with results of studies involving small-
er series of patients who have undergone epilepsy 
surgery.8,12,13 Pathological diagnosis was aided by 
identification of anatomical landmarks, best 
appreciated in gross anatomical specimens. An 
international consensus recommendation for the 
procurement of brain tissue from patients with 
epilepsy on the basis of the identification of ana-
tomical landmarks has recently been proposed by 
the ILAE Commission on Diagnostic Methods.16
Among the patients with hippocampal sclero-
sis, 78.1% were younger than 18 years of age at 
disease onset; however, 88.7% of patients with 
this condition were adults at the time epilepsy 
surgery was performed, after a mean duration of 
epilepsy of 22.5 years. We suggested in a previous 
article that difficulties in identifying hippocam-
pal sclerosis by means of routine MRI may contrib-
ute to this delay.21 Our current analysis also sug-
gests that patients with left hippocampal sclerosis 
had an earlier onset of epilepsy than did patients 
with right hippocampal sclerosis, but the differ-
ences were small and require confirmation.
Ganglioglioma and dysembryoplastic neuro-
epithelial tumors were the tumors most frequent-
ly found in our series, both in adults and in 
children. In contrast, infiltrating gliomas were 
uncommon, perhaps because patients with these 
tumors are usually not treated in specialized epi-
lepsy surgery centers. Focal cortical dysplasias 
have been reported as being increasingly frequent 
in series of patients who have undergone epilepsy 
surgery.8,10,11,13 Cognitive delay and early onset of 
seizures have been associated with these lesions, 
but the clinical implications vary according to 
subtype.14 Among the subtypes, the histopatho-
logical diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia type I 
is particularly challenging, and we used immuno-
histochemical staining for NeuN22 and nonphos-
phorylated neurofilament protein to identify 
cortical-layer abnormalities. A new category of 
focal cortical dysplasia type III was introduced 
in the 2011 consensus classification system of 
the ILAE, but its pathogenic basis and histo-
pathological definition have not been clarified,14 
and this subtype was not considered to be a 
separate entity in our analysis.
In children and adults, 6.1% and 8.4%, respec-
tively, of tissue samples had astrogliosis only and 
could not be categorized as having any conven-
tional lesion type. This does not imply that the 
tissue was functionally normal, since 50.2% of 
patients with drug-resistant seizures before epi-
lepsy surgery and unclassifiable tissue samples 
were seizure-free 12 months after surgery, which 
implicates the resected tissue in the genesis of 
the seizures. It is also possible that a molecular 
alteration that can decrease seizure threshold but 
is not apparent as an abnormality on light micros-
copy was an element involved in the conditions in 
this group of patients.23 Ambiguous histopatho-
logical findings may also result from the incon-
sistent nature of neurosurgical sampling. Newly 
characterized histopathological entities in patients 
with focal epilepsies, such as oligodendroglial hy-
perplasia in white matter and hyaline protoplasmic 
astrocytopathy, may reduce the number of histo-
pathologically nonlesional diagnoses in samples 
obtained during epilepsy surgery in the future.24,25
The limitations of our study include the retro-
spective data analysis and biases that are inher-
ent in selecting patients with epilepsy for surgi-
cal treatment. Furthermore, some of the surgical 
procedures during which tissue was obtained 
involved disconnection procedures that do not 
typically allow for the microscopic identification 
of a brain lesion. The data from this large series 
add to the information on microscopically de-
