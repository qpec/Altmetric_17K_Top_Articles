Clusters of tumor cells are often observed in the blood of cancer patients. These structures have been described as
malignant entities for more than 50 years, although their comprehensive characterization is lacking. Contrary to cur-
rent consensus, we demonstrate that a discrete population of circulating cell clusters isolated from the blood of co-
lorectal cancer patients are not cancerous but consist of tumor-derived endothelial cells. These clusters express both
epithelial and mesenchymal markers, consistent with previous reports on circulating tumor cell (CTC) phenotyping.
However, unlike CTCs, they do not mirror the genetic variations of matched tumors. Transcriptomic analysis of single
clusters revealed that these structures exhibit an endothelial phenotype and can be traced back to the tumor endo-
thelium. Further results show that tumor-derived endothelial clusters do not form by coagulation or by outgrowth of
singlecirculating endothelial cells,supporting adirect release of clusters from the tumorvasculature.The isolationand
enumeration of these benign clusters distinguished healthy volunteers from treatment-naïve as well as pathological
early-stage (≤IIA) colorectal cancer patients with high accuracy, suggesting that tumor-derived circulating endothelial
cell clusters could be used as a means of noninvasive screening for colorectal cancer. In contrast to CTCs, tumor-
derived endothelial cell clusters may also provide important information about the underlying tumor vasculature
at the time of diagnosis, during treatment, and throughout the course of the disease.
INTRODUCTION
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) comprise a rare population of cells often
found in the blood of cancer patients. They continue to undergo exten-
sive characterization with the hopes that they will offer insights into
cancer metastasis and also provide better biomarkers of disease progres-
sion and therapeutic response (1). Enumeration of CTCs has revealed
prognostic information for metastatic breast cancer, colorectal cancer
(CRC), and prostate cancer patients (2), whereas the data supporting
CTC burden for the prediction of treatment effectiveness are less
established (3, 4). The molecular profile of CTCs, rather than their
quantity, might be a better approach for predicting drug responses (5).
In addition to their recognition as individual cells, CTCs have been
observed as clusters of multiple cells since at least 1960 (6). Such clusters
expressed mesenchymal markers in a longitudinal study of metastatic
breast cancer patients (7), particularly FOXC1, which was a marker of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (7, 8). Recently, CTC
clusters in blood from both breast and prostate cancer patients cor-
related with shorter progression-free survival (9). Aceto et al. (9) further
studied the formation and dynamics of CTC clusters in preclinical
models, demonstrating a causative role forCTCclusters in breast cancer
progression. A prospective trial in lung cancer patients confirmed that
CTC clusters [also called circulating tumor microemboli (CTM)] were
less apoptotic than single CTCs, and their detection was associated with
poorer overall and progression-free survival (10).
Despite the high interest associated with these cells, their character-
ization has been relatively limited, owing to technical challenges of iso-
lation and single-cell analysis. The clinical relevance of CTC clusters is
not well defined, especially compared with that of single CTCs. To
overcome these limitations, we comprehensively studied CTC clusters at
the single-cell scale from a cohort of unselected CRC patients, by integrat-
ing microfiltration techniques, high-throughput DNA sequencing and
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and computational modeling applied to clin-
icalspecimens. InCRCpatients,CTCclusterswere notmalignantbutwere
instead tumor-derived endothelial cells (tECs) correlating with features of
the underlying tumor vasculature. Notably, the isolation and count of
these clusters could distinguish healthy volunteers from preoperative,
early-stage (≤IIA) CRC patients with high accuracy, indicating a poten-
tial role for circulating tEC clusters as a screening biomarker for CRC.
RESULTS
Isolation and retrieval of single CD45− clusters using a
silicon-based microfiltration device
We originally aimed to analyze the transcriptional and genetic profiles
of single CTCs in CRC patients and so developed a label-free microfil-
tration device, which isolated cells on the basis of size (11–13) and
enabled both retrieval and downstream analysis of CTCs (Fig. 1, A to

 C, and fig. S1A). From the device, 98% of the captured cells could be
retrieved for downstream molecular analysis (fig. S1B). We optimized
CTC enrichment and retrieval efficiency by spiking 1 ml of donor blood
with 30 SW620 cells, a CRC cell line with a median diameter similar to
CTCs (~12 mm) (14) (fig. S1C). We obtained an optimal trade-off be-
tween retrieval efficiency and cell purity using a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min
and microsieve pore sizes of 9 to 10 mm (Fig. 1D). This resulted in >90%
SW620 retrieval efficiency with >5000-fold depletion of white blood
cells, which are considered impurities (fig. S1D). Similar retrieval effi-
ciencies were obtained using three alternative CRC cell lines of varying
sizes (fig. S1, C and E).

EpCAM+ cells (Fig. 1, E and F); however,
we noted the presence of large (average
diameter, ~40 mm) clusters of EpCAM−/
CD45− cells (Fig. 1, F to H). The isolated
clusters had a cytomorphology consistent
with malignancy, such as atypical nuclei,
prominent nucleoli, and high nuclear-to-
cytoplasmic ratio (Fig. 1H).
The CD45− clusters express keratins
and mesenchymal markers but
do not mirror primary
tumor mutations
CTCs have been shown to lose EpCAM
expressionin circulation, suggesting adrift
from the epithelial phenotype (7, 8, 15). Be-
cause of their malignant cytomorphology
and loss of EpCAM expression, which
might indicate ongoing EMT of tumor cells
(7), we hypothesized that these CD45−
clusters harbored genetic alterations mirror-
ing those occurring in the primary tumor.
To identify DNA mutations in single cells
or clusters undergoing EMT, we developed
a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based
method to simultaneously quantify RNA
transcripts and detect DNA mutations,
which is called single-cell RNA and muta-
tional analysis PCR (scrmPCR) (fig. S2
and table S1). scrmPCR was first tested on
known mutant alleles in an epithelial-like
(DLD-1) and a mesenchymal-like (RKO)
CRC cell line. The efficiency of targeted
DNA amplification was about 70% for
single cells and >90% for at least three cells
for each amplicon (fig. S2). Eight clusters
derived from four patients had mostly
mesenchymal markers, including FN1,
SERPINE1, and FOXC1, but three of the
clusters also expressed the epithelial mark-
er KRT8 (Fig. 2, A and B). EMT marker
profiles in the clusters were confirmed by
staining for pan-cytokeratin (panCK) and
vimentin (fig. S3A).
We sequenced the same single clusters
for mutations present in the corresponding
primary tumors because mutations match-
ing the primary tumor are often found in
CTCs (16). Surprisingly, all tested DNA
sequence hotspots matched the wild-type
alleles(Fig.2C).Wefurtherappliedtargeted

Downloaded from 
 high-throughput DNA sequencing to eight commonly mutated genes in
DNA amplified from 15 single CTC clusters (n = 6 patients) and their
corresponding primary tumor tissues. To avoid false-positive mutations
introduced by the amplification procedure, we only considered mutations
with>10%variantallelefrequency(VAF)(tableS2).Inagreementwiththe
scrmPCR results, mutations found in the tumor tissues were not detected
in the CD45− clusters (table S3). Similarly,
mutations found in the clusters were not
detected in the tumor tissues (table S4 and
fig. S3, B and C). However, we detected
multiple matching germline variantsusing
the same method (0 of 58 matching muta-
tions versus 12 of 28 matching germline
variants; P = 2 × 10−7, power = 0.997,
two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) (table S5). We
next performed array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) to detect chromo-
somal abnormalities using amplified DNA
from 12 single clusters (n = 4 patients) be-
cause copy number variations for CTCs
from lung cancer patients have been shown
to mirrorthoseof primary tumortissue (18).
However, unlike matched primary tumors,
our clusters had normal cytogenetic profiles
(Fig. 2, D and E, and fig. S3, D and E).
In summary, although analysis of indi-
vidual CTC clusters revealed cytomorphol-
ogies and epithelial-mesenchymal marker
expression similar to those of a previous
reporton CTCs(7),100% (27of 27) of sin-
gle CD45− clusters from nine patients did
not share the genetic anomalies found in
matching primary tumor tissues. In addi-
tion, DNA sequencing of 15 single CD45−
clusters from six patients revealed the pres-
ence of mutations that were not found in
thetumortissue(tableS3andfig.S4).These
observations suggest that the source of the
CD45−clustersisnotthetumorepithelium.
Circulating CD45− clusters are
endothelial cells
We next profiled RNA expression in 18
single CD45− clusters from eight patients
and matched normal colon and tumor tis-
sues using high-throughput RNA-seq (fig.
S4 and tables S6 and S7). We also devel-
oped a workflow to infer 36 different cell
types from RNA-seq data (fig. S5 and table
S8). To this end, we first determined genes
specific for each cell type (table S9 and fig.
S6, A andB) andanalyzed theirpresence in
a data set made of published RNA-seq data
(used as a positive control) (table S10).
Using this approach, we obtained specific
signals for each cell type (fig. S6, C and
D). By applying this inference method to
our RNA-seq data set of single CD45−
clusters, we found that all transcriptomes
were associated with cell types of the endo-
theliallineage (Fig. 3A). We confirmed this

 result by scrmPCR in an additional 14 clusters from four patients (Fig.
3B). These results are in agreement with our findings from Fig. 2 be-
cause endothelial cellsare knownto expressbothmesenchymal markers
and various keratins (classical epithelial markers) (19). Without excep-
tion, all clusters, including those displaying a malignant cyto-
morphology, stained for endothelial markers such as CD31, VWF,
and CD144 (Fig. 3C) but were negative for CD45 or markers of mega-
karyocytic lineages suchasCD41 and CD42B. Thus, in ourCRC patients,
all circulating CTC clusters were of endothelial origin. In addition, we did
not detect single tumor cells within our clusters.
Our findings are in line with those of El-Heliebi et al. (20), reporting
CD31 expression on circulating nonhematological cells (CNHCs) from
kidney cancer patients, but are not consistent with a recent report de-
scribing CTC clusters of malignant origins (9). Cell-type inference
based on the single-cell scale RNA-seq data for CTC clusters in the
study of Aceto et al. (9) indicated, in contrast to our data, the presence

 of epithelial-derived cells (fig. S7). Further experiments indicated that
our circulating endothelial cell clusters were negative for CD133, an
established marker for endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (Fig. 3D)
(21). In addition, an EPC clonogenic assay (22) revealed that the endo-
thelial clusters did not contain EPCs because live clusters failed to pro-
liferate on a fibronectin substrate over a 30-day period (Fig. 3E).
Therefore, the cellular structures characterized in our study represent
a distinct population of nonproliferating endothelial cell clusters circu-
lating in the blood of CRC patients (table S11).
Circulating endothelial clusters are tumor-derived
Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a stronger association of the
endothelial cell clustertranscriptomeswiththe tumortissuesthan withthe
normaltissuesamples(fig.S8A),indicatingthattheclustersmightbetECs.
To test this hypothesis, we isolated normal endothelial cells (nECs) and
tECs from matched frozen tissue samples and profiled them by RNA-
seq (fig. S8B and table S7). We also profiled the RNA expression of three
primaryendothelialcell typesderivedfromtheumbilicalvein,normalskin,
and prostate (HUVECs, HDMECs, and HPrMEC, respectively). The aver-
age expression of the endothelial cell cluster genes associated significantly
with the intestinal-derived endothelial cells, but not with other nECs (fig.
S8C). We subsequently classified the endothelial cell clusters on the basis of
differential gene expression derived by comparing nEC with tEC transcrip-
tomes(fig.S8D).Usingalineardiscriminantanalysis(LDA)modelderived
from this comparison, we could classify 16 of 18 endothelial cell clusters as
tECs and the remaining 2 clusters as nECs (Fig. 4A). This enrichment was
significantly different from random classification and indicated that most
circulating endothelial cell clusters belonged to the population of tECs.
If the endothelial cell clusters originated from the tumor vasculature,
we would expect a drop of cluster count shortly after tumor resection.

 To test this hypothesis, we collected paired samples from 17 CRC pa-
tients 0 to 24 hours before and 24 to 72 hours after surgical tumor re-
section (n = 34 samples in total). Tumor removal caused a sharp,
significant decline in the numbers of circulating endothelial cell clusters,
supporting the hypothesis that these structures were tumor-derived
(Fig. 4B and table S12). In addition, this experiment indicates that cir-
culating endothelial cell clusters do not originate from the peripheral
circulation as outgrowth of single circulating endothelial cells but in-
stead might be directly released as clusters from the tumor vasculature.
Folatehydrolase(FOLH1),thegenecodingforprostate-specificmem-
brane antigen (PSMA), is specifically ex-
pressed in the tumor vasculature of various
cancer types but is absent in normal vascu-
lature and peripheral blood (23, 24). FOLH1
expression was detected in CD31+CD45−
cells isolated from fresh CRC tissues and in
microfiltrates from the blood of 7 of 11 CRC
patients, but not in endothelial cells isolated
from normal tissues or in microfiltrates
derivedfromhealthydonors(Fig.4C),pro-
viding further support for the tumor origin
of our endothelial cell clusters. In addition,
RNA-seq on the single circulating endo-
thelial cell clusters indicated the expression
of several published tumor endothelial
markers (fig. S8E) (23, 25).
Using a CRC xenograft mouse model,
wetestedwhetherclustersof tECswerere-
leased in the circulation by transplanting
tumors harboring fluorescent stroma into
normal, wild-type mice and then analyz-
ing the presence of single and multi-
nucleated fluorescent endothelial cells in
the blood by flow cytometry (fig. S9, A
to D). Circulating, multinucleated green
fluorescent protein (GFP)–positive endo-
thelial cells were present in three of four
mice with transplanted GFP+ xenografts
but not in the control group (fig. S9E), in-
dicating that tEC clusters were in the cir-
culation of mice with growing tumors.
Finally, we investigated whether the
number of circulating endothelial clusters
correlated with features of the underlying
tumor vasculature in CRC patients by ana-
lyzing blood vessels in tumor tissues iso-
lated from patients with a low (≤10 per
2 ml of blood) or high (>10 per 2 ml of
blood) endothelial cluster count. Although
the median number of microvessel units
did not differ between patients, the median
number of lumens and their sizes were sig-
nificantly higher in patients with high
numbers of circulating endothelial cell
clusters (Fig. 4, D and E). In addition, we
noted an increase of mosaic and damaged
vessels in tumor tissues compared to
matched normal tissues and in patients
withhighendothelialclustercountscomparedtopatientswithlowcluster
counts (Fig. 4, F and G). Together, our results demonstrate that circulat-
ing endothelial clusters in CRC patients are not malignant entities but are
clusters of tumor-derived, CD133–, nonproliferating endothelial cells,
correlating with features of the underlying tumor vasculature.

 than being shed as a cluster from the tumor. However, the circulating
endothelial clusters that we isolated from CRC patients stained negative
forfibrin, the main component of the coagulation cascade (Fig. 5A), and
did not contain platelets (Fig. 3C and table S11). In addition, in CRC
patients, the number of endothelial clusters did not correlate with the
concentration of plasma D dimer, a marker for intravascular coagula-
tion (Fig. 5B).
To testwhethercirculating endothelialcellscoagulatetoformclusters
in circulation, we injected fluorescently labeled single (dissociated)
murine colorectaltumor (CT26)–derived
endothelial cells into the tail vein of Balb/c
mice and analyzed the formation of multi-
nucleated events at different time points
after injection (Fig. 5, C to E). Single endo-
thelial cells did not aggregate to form multi-
colored clusters and were cleared within
60 min upon injection (Fig. 5F). These
experiments provide additional support
for the hypothesis that tEC clusters circu-
lating in the blood of CRC patients may be
directly shed from the tumor vasculature.
Tumor-derived endothelial cell
clusters are prevalent
in CRC patients
The associations between circulating en-
dothelial cell clusters and the primary tu-
mor prompted us to investigate whether
these clusters were indicators of CRC.
We counted endothelial cell clusters from
a test set composed of 141 clinical speci-
mens taken from 125 subjects (45 control
healthy volunteers and a consecutive se-
ries of 80 CRC patients, including the
above-mentioned patients) (table S13).
At least one cluster was detected in 76.2%
(61 of 80) of CRC patients, compared to
only 2.2% (1 of 45) of healthy individuals
(Fig. 6A). Treatment-naïve CRC patients
(n = 52) presented significantly higher en-
dothelial cluster counts than patients who
had already received any treatment for
CRC (n = 28) (Fig. 6B). However, endo-
thelialcell cluster count was not associated
with clinical parameters such as tumor
stage, grade, or presence of distant metas-
tasis (Fig. 6B and fig. S10A).
Analysis of endothelial cell cluster dis-
tributionsovertimeindicatedthatsurgical
resection of the primary tumor had the
strongest effect on cluster counts (Fig. 6C
and table S14), confirming the results in
Fig. 4B that show a sharp decline in the
numbers of circulating endothelial cell
clusters before and after surgical resection
of the tumorandproviding furthersupport
for the association of circulating endotheli-
al cell clusters with the presence of a
primary tumor. The presence of these cells in 86.5% of treatment-naïve
patients (45 of 52) but only in 2.2% of healthy controls (1 of 45) indicated
that the endothelial cell cluster count might be useful in assisting CRC
diagnosis. Treatment-naïve patients were distinguished from healthy
controls on the basis of their endothelial cell cluster burden [area under
the curve (AUC), 0.930] (Fig. 6D). CRC patients with early-stage path-
ological tumors (stage ≤IIA) were also positive for endothelial cell
clusters in 86.4% of cases (19 of 22), with an AUC of 0.922 (Fig. 6D).

6D, showing identical expected diagnostic performance (AUC, 0.923)
(Fig. 6E and table S13). Furthermore, the number of circulating endo-
thelial cell clusters did not correlate with potentially confounding
variables, such as patient age, systemic inflammatory markers, or hy-
pertension, cardiovascular diseases, or diabetes (fig. S10, B and C).
Together,the widespreadpresence of circulating endothelialcellclusters
in treatment-naïve patients, but not in healthy individuals, indicates the
potential usefulness of endothelial cell cluster count as a diagnostic adjunct
for CRC, even early in disease (stage ≤IIA).
DISCUSSION
Here, we present a subpopulation of tumor-derived cells of endothelial
origin that appear to challenge the consensus that all CTC clusters are
malignant entities. Intending to isolate CTCs from CRC patients, we
instead identified clusters with both epithelial and mesenchymal char-
acteristics that expressed endothelial markers. Through a series of
biochemical, genetic, and in vivo analyses, we determined that these
cells are nonmalignant, are tumor-derived, are of endothelial origin,
and reflect the properties of the primary tumor vasculature. Our study
provides experimental evidence for the occurrence of a second tumor-
derived cellular entity in the blood, alongside bona fide CTCs. In support
of our findings, a recent study described a subpopulation of CD276+
mature circulating endothelial cells, correlating with the presence of a
primarytumorinesophagealandnon–smallcelllungcancerpatients(26).
Tumor-derived endothelial cell clusters might be senescent or non-
replicative endothelial cells shed as multiple-cell structures from the
chaotic tumor vasculature as it undergoes pathological angiogenesis
(27), a recognized early event in CRC tumor progression (28). It is
not clear how large clusters of cells travel from the primary tumor
to the peripheral blood vasculature. One of the possible routes to
bypass the capillary circuit could be through arteriovenous anastomo-
ses, which are large circulatory connections between arterial and venous
circulation (29). Recently, Au et al. (30) showed that clusters of tumor
cells, owing to their high deformability, can even traverse capillary-
sized blood vessels.
Unlike Aceto et al. (9), we did not detect the presence of clusters of
epithelial CTCs. This might be the result of different patient profiles.
Aceto et al. (9) analyzed blood samples from terminal breast cancer pa-
tients, whereas our patients were mostly preoperative CRC patients. A
second explanation may be that epithelial clusters are more deformable
than endothelial clusters and consequently traversed the microsieve
pores of our device during the isolation procedure (30). Nonetheless,
we can conclude that CTC clusters do not constitute a homogeneous
population and that at least two different tumor-derived population exist:
an epithelial-derived population, characterized by malignant potential,
and the endothelial population described in this study. Although the en-
dothelial cluster cytomorphology is reminiscent of malignancy, with ex-
pression of keratins and mesenchymal markers, these cells should not be
confused with malignant CTCs undergoing EMT. Research efforts inter-
rogating the role of EMT in CTC clusters should consider the spurious
relationships introduced by unintentional isolation of circulating endo-
thelial cell clusters. For example, our endothelial clusters not only
expressed vimentin but also were positive for mesenchymal genetic mar-
kers such as FN1, SERPINE1, and FOXC1. A few circulating endothelial
clusters expressed transcripts for keratin 8 and 18 or stained positive
for the pan-keratin antibody C11, further suggesting a potential
confounding role of tECs in CTC studies, especially those using label-
free isolation techniques (17).
Our study has some limitations. For example, we could not study the
number of single tECs in circulation because our device would not fully
recover cells with a diameter of <10 mm. In addition, we could not de-
termine whether mutations found in our endothelial clusters were tech-
nical artifacts, owing to the whole-genome amplification procedure
(which are known to occur especially in PCR-based amplifications),
or real sporadic mutations (table S4). The presence of potentially
false-positive mutations in our samples, however, does not compromise
our results ultimately because only matching mutations between circu-
lating clusters and tumor tissue would be conclusive. Finally, we note
that aberrant endothelial clusters similar to the ones we have character-
ized here have been reported in patients with increased risk for acute
myocardial infarction (31). This indicates that the presence of endothe-
lial clusters in the blood might not be specific to neoplastic diseases, but
rather a general indicator for vascular fragility.
In conclusion, we describe circulating endothelial cell clusters as a
tumor-derived entity widespread in all stages of CRC. This insight opens
up multiple new opportunities for translational research in querying dis-
ease status, in CRC and other cancers. For example, endothelial cluster
burden may be used for early CRC detection. Additional prospective
trials, including patients with colorectal adenomas, would be required
to validate such diagnostic utility. Profiling of circulating endothelial cell
clusters also promises to reveal features of the underlying tumor vascula-
ture,particularlyonadynamicbasis.Forexample,drugresponsestoanti-
angiogenic drugs could be tested using endothelial cluster counts. These
cells may also be characterized to select patients who would respond to
drugs targeting endothelial surface markers currently under clinical eval-
uation, such as PSMA (24). In addition, live circulating endothelial
clusters could offer an intriguing in vitro model to test drug responses
targeting the tumor vasculature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The aim of this study was to comprehensively characterize CTCs in un-
selected CRC patients as a noninvasive method to derive information
on underlying tumor characteristics. Devices and methods were opti-
mized using cell lines and healthy donor blood samples before the study
of clinical samples. Initial observations of the presence of circulating
CD45−clusters were recorded from a pilot series of five patients. Further
molecular characterization studies were performed on circulating
CD45− clusters in unselected patients as described in table S14. Con-
currently, we designed a case-control study to determine whether
CD45− clusters counts were associated with the presence of CRC.
To determine the required minimal sample size, we first assumed that
there was no association between samples positive for CD45− clusters
(≥1 cluster per 2 ml of blood) and CRC (null hypothesis). For a target
power of 0.95, this resulted in an estimated minimal sample size of n =
72 using the pwr.chisq.test function of the pwr package in the R
environment (version 3.1.0) (32). An effect size of w = 0.5 was as-
sumed at the two-sided significance level of 0.01. The effect size w
was chosen on the basis of the pilot test of five CRC patients (all pos-
itive for circulating CD45− clusters) (Fig. 1D) and information derived
from four healthy controls with negative cluster counts. Moreover, we

 considered a review of the literature that reported the rare presence of
clusters in healthy individuals and the abundant presence of CTC
clusters and CTM in various types of cancer. An independent set of
100 individuals was further used to validate initial results on CD45−
cluster counts. Replicates and repeats are indicated in figure captions,
and the collection of clinical data and its blinding are described in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Clinical samples collection
All samples were obtained according to protocols approved by the In-
stitutional Review Boards of the National University of Singapore,
Fortis Surgical Hospital (FSH), and Singapore Health Services. All
227 subjects gave informed written consent to participate. The clinical
samples for the test set (n = 127) were obtained between July 2012 and
April 2014. The clinical samples for the validation set (n = 100) were
obtained between July 2014 and August 2015. Consecutive blood
samples from 99 CRC patients were provided by FSH and the National
Cancer Centre, Singapore. Blood samples from 128 healthy subjects
were provided by the Singapore Consortium of Cohort Studies and
by donors of the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology.
Device fabrication
Silicon microsieves were fabricated as described by Lim et al. (13). The
microsieve consisted of a silicon disk with an overall diameter (ø) of 7.3
mm and a 300-mm-thick support ring. The central capture region
measured ø = 5.3 mm and was 60 mm thick; it contained 100,000 cir-
cular pores obtained by deep reactive ion etching. To embed the micro-
sieve in a sterile 3-ml syringe, we designed an acrylic sleeve insert
consisting of an inlet channel with ø = 8.58 mm tapering to a ø =
5.54-mm channel, which corresponded to the microsieve cell capture
region. The sleeve insert housed the microsieve and silicone O-rings
(0.5 mm thick) that ensured a good seal and provided cushioning, as
shown in Fig. 1B. Details on device assembly and microfiltration opti-
mization are provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
On-sieve immunofluorescence
Cell suspensions were stained for 30 min directly “on-sieve” after five
washes in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum al-
bumin,2mMEDTA, andhumanFcRBlockingReagent(MiltenyiBiotec)
using the antibodies and fluorescent dyes listed in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods. After a washing step, cells were retrieved and
visualized in suspension under an inverted fluorescence microscope
(IX81, Olympus) for imaging, counting, and/or micromanipulation.
Images were recorded using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices)
with a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics).

cell or CD45− cellular cluster with a major axis of >10 mm and having
at least two clearly distinct nuclei.” All identified clusters stained positive
for endothelial markers CD31, CD144, or VWF (Fig. 3C). Therefore, in
our study, CD45− clusters and endothelial cell clusters refer to the same
population. Cellular populations belonging to the megakaryocytic lineages,
withlargelobulatedsinglenucleiorlargeroundsinglenuclei,wereexcluded
from the analysis. The characteristic cytomorphology of these cells was
clearly different from that of CD45− clusters with positive staining for
CD41 and CD42B. Megakaryocytic cells were predominantly observed
in CRC patients undergoing treatment. Single endothelial cells were also
excluded from the analysis. CD45− clusters were counted by transfer-
ring the microfiltrate obtained from 2 ml of whole blood to the well of a
96-well plate. After brief centrifugation, the cell clusters were identified
and counted by manually scanning the target well three times using a
20× objective. A positive sample was defined by the detection of at least
one CD45− cluster.
Single-cell RNA and mutational analysis PCR
All primers were designed using Primer-BLAST (33). For each RNA
transcript, primers were designed either to span exon-exon boundaries
or to anneal to regions separated by at least one intron on the
corresponding genomic DNA region. Primers for mutational analysis
were designed to bind intronic regions of the target gene (table S1). The
scrmPCR method is highlighted in fig. S2A and integrated several work-
flowstepsderivedfromtheCellsDirect One-StepqRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen),
the Biomark HD system (Fluidigm), and the work of Peixoto et al. (34).
Further details are provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Targeted resequencing and aCGH of circulating
CD45− clusters
Single CD45− clusters (n = 34 from 12 patients) were subjected to
whole-genome amplification using the GenomePlex Single Cell Whole
Genome Amplification Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. This method was chosen after comparison tests for efficiency
of amplification with an alternative method based on multiple
displacement amplification. For the aCGH experiment, 50 pg of tissue
DNA samples was amplified using the same procedure. All amplified
samples were tested for ACTB DNA amplification by quantitative
PCR. Nine clusters were removed from the analysis because of poor
amplification of the reference gene. For targeted resequencing, a custom
gene panel was designed to target exons for NRAS, CTNNB1, PIK3CA,
EGFR, BRAF, PTEN, KRAS, AKT1, and TP53 genes (~6.1 kb). The li-
braries were constructed using Ion AmpliSeq Library Kits 2.0 (Life
Technologies) with 10 ng of input DNA from the amplified clusters
or the unamplified tissue DNA. Fifteen libraries were successfully gen-
erated from an initial number of 25 single CD45− clusters. The targeted
resequencing run was performed using an Ion Torrent Personal Ge-
nome Machine Sequencer (Life Technologies). Variants were called
using the Ion Torrent Variant Caller Plugin with high-stringency set-
tings. aCGH was performed by hybridizing 250 ng of DNA to CytoScan
750K arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and using recommended reagents. Data were analyzed and visualized
using ChAS software version 2.1 (Affymetrix).
cDNA synthesis and RNA-seq
cDNA was synthesized from 30 single CD45− clusters, 10 pg of whole
tissue, 10 pg of laser-dissected endothelial cells, or 10 pg of primary en-
dothelial cell RNA. To this end, we used the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA
Kit (Clontech Laboratories) and long-distance PCR for 25 cycles for the
clusters and 18 cycles for the remaining samples. At this stage, four
clusters were excluded from the analysis because of non-amplification.
For each sample, cDNA was sheared using the Adaptive Focused Acous-
tics system (Covaris). Libraries were constructed using the NEBNext
DNA Library Prep Master Mix Kit (New England Biolabs). Eight
clusters were further removed from the analysis because of poor library
quality. All remaining libraries were barcoded using unique indices and
pooled for RNA-seq run on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Data
were mapped to human genome version 19 (hg19) using TopHat

 (version 2). Cufflinks (version 2.2) was used to quantify fragments per
kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) (35).
RNA-seq data analysis
The cell-type inference workflow was implemented in a custom R script
(available upon request). PCA, differential gene expression analysis, and
LDA were performed in the R environment (version 3.1.0) (32). Further
details are in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Microvessel staining and analysis
Immunohistochemical staining of CD31 was performed on all available
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues (n = 28) with matching
CD45− cluster count. Tissue sections (4 mm) were placed on poly-L-lysine
slides and stained with anti-CD31 antibodies in a 1:50 dilution (JC70A,
Dako) for 20 min following the manufacturer’s instructions on a BOND
Automated Stainer (Leica Biosystems). Microvessel density and lumen
counts on all sections were determined similarly as described previously
(36). See the Supplementary Materials and Methods for more details.
Experimental mice
All animals were housed at the Biological Resource Centre, Agency for
Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). Animal procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
A*STAR and performed in compliance with the National Advisory
Committee for Laboratory Animal Research (NACLAR) Guidelines.
Experimental procedures are described in Fig. 5C and fig. S9A, with de-
tails provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in the R environment (version
3.1.0) (32). Unpaired samples were tested using a two-tailed Wilcoxon-
Mann-WhitneyU testwithBonferroni correction in thecaseofmultiple
comparisons. For paired samples, the two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank
test was used. For each test, the exact P value was computed using the
coin package. ROC curves with AUC and 95% CI were computed using
the pROC package. Hierarchical clustering with bootstrapped P values
in fig. S8C was computed using pvclust. To simplify the interpretation
and comparison of effect size, the effect size r was derived for each sta-
tistical test as follows: r ¼ jZj=
ffiffiffi
n
p , where Z is the z score calculated
from the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U or the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. rwasconvertedfromthe resulting AUC andoddsratio asdescribed
in (37). Using Cohen’s definition, r = 0.1 can be interpreted as a small
effect, r = 0.3 can be interpreted as a medium effect, and r = 0.5 can be
interpreted as a large effect (37). Box plots were drawn with boxes repre-
senting the IQR, a line across the box indicating the median, and
whiskers indicating 1.5 × IQR. Outliers were not shown. Correlations
were described using Kendall’s tau (t) coefficient and its derived P value.
The significance threshold was set at 0.05.
