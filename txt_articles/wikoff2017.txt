Abstract 
To date, one of the most heavily cited assessments of caffeine safety in the peer-reviewed 
literature is that issued by Health Canada (Nawrot et al., 2003). Since then, >10,000 papers have 
been published related to caffeine, including hundreds of reviews on specific human health 
effects; however, to date, none have compared the wide range of topics evaluated by Nawrot et 
al. (2003). Thus, as an update to this foundational publication, we conducted a systematic review 
of data on potential adverse effects of caffeine published from 2001 to June 2015. Subject matter 
experts and research team participants developed five PECO (population, exposure, comparator, 
and outcome) questions to address five types of outcomes (acute toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, 
bone and calcium effects, behavior, and development and reproduction) in four healthy 
populations (adults, pregnant women, adolescents, and children) relative to caffeine intake doses 
determined not to be associated with adverse effects by Health Canada (comparators: 400 
mg/day for adults [10 g for lethality], 300 mg/day for pregnant women, and 2.5 mg/kg/day for 
children and adolescents). The a priori search strategy identified >5000 articles that were 
screened, with 381 meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria for the five outcomes (pharmacokinetics 
was addressed contextually, adding 46 more studies). Data were extracted by the research team 
and rated for risk of bias and indirectness (internal and external validity). Selected no- and low-
effect intakes were assessed relative to the population-specific comparator. Conclusions were 
drawn for the body of evidence for each outcome, as well as endpoints within an outcome, using 
a weight of evidence approach. When the total body of evidence was evaluated and when study 
quality, consistency, level of adversity, and magnitude of response were considered, the evidence 
generally supports that consumption of up to 400 mg caffeine/day in healthy adults is not 
associated with overt, adverse cardiovascular effects, behavioral effects, reproductive and

developmental effects, acute effects, or bone status. Evidence also supports consumption of up to 
300 mg caffeine/day in healthy pregnant women as an intake that is generally not associated with 
adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Limited data were identified for child and 
adolescent populations; the available evidence suggests that 2.5 mg caffeine/kg body weight/day 
remains an appropriate recommendation. The results of this systematic review support a shift in 
caffeine research to focus on characterizing effects in sensitive populations and establishing 
better quantitative characterization of interindividual variability (e.g., epigenetic trends), 
subpopulations (e.g., unhealthy populations, individuals with preexisting conditions), conditions 
(e.g., coexposures), and outcomes (e.g., exacerbation of risk-taking behavior) that could render 
individuals to be at greater risk relative to healthy adults and healthy pregnant women. This 
review, being one of the first to apply systematic review methodologies to toxicological 
assessments, also highlights the need for refined guidance and frameworks unique to the conduct 
of systematic review in this field.

1. Introduction  
Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a pharmacologically active component of many foods, 
beverages, dietary supplements, and drugs; it is also used to treat very ill newborns afflicted with 
apnea (temporary cessation of breathing). Caffeine occurs naturally in some plant leaves, seeds, 
and fruits, where it serves as an herbicide, insect repellant, and even attractant for pollination 
(Lee et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2013). This botanically sourced compound is the most commonly 
consumed stimulant worldwide (Fredholm et al., 1999). Caffeine enters the human food chain 
through plant-derived foods such as coffee beans, tea leaves, guarana, cocoa beans, and kola nuts 
(Barone and Roberts, 1996). Coffee is one of the major contributors of caffeine to the diet 
(Mitchell et al., 2015); since the late 1980s, the energy drink market has emerged as another 
source of caffeine in the diet (Richards and Smith, 2016). Consumption practices were recently 
investigated by Mitchell et al. (2014), who reported that 85% of the US population ingests at 
least one caffeine-containing beverage per day, and by Fulgoni et al. (2015), who reported that 
89% of the population uses caffeine in some form. In addition to standard beverages, a number 
of other caffeinated products, such as maple syrup, beef jerky, and donuts, have entered the 
market, suggesting substantial consumer interest in diverse sources of caffeine. Because of the 
variation in caffeine content of beverages due to a wide range in dose and infusion times as well 
as unexpected sources of caffeine appearing on the market, assessing exposure to caffeine has a 
great deal of uncertainty.  This, in combination with uncertainty in the use of dietary intake 
surveys, as well as simultaneous exposure to many substances when consuming the various 
caffeine sources, are well-known limitations in the evidence base.

Caffeine is generally recognized as safe by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at a use 
level not to exceed 200 ppm (0.02%) in cola-type beverages for the specific intended use of 
flavor (21CFR§182.1180). Caffeinated beverages, like coffee, have been consumed for centuries. 
Current estimates suggest that the mean consumption of caffeine (all ages) is 165 mg/day, ~105 
mg of which is associated with coffee consumption (Mitchell et al., 2015). Emergence of other 
products containing caffeine, particularly energy drinks, combined with controversies  regarding 
the potential for increased consumption by nonadult populations (Drewnowski and Rehm, 2016; 
McGuire, 2014), has been accompanied by concerns regarding the impact of these products on 
consumer health. Regulatory agencies worldwide, including those in the United States, Europe, 
Canada, New Zealand, India, and Australia, have evaluated caffeine safety, and several agencies 
have issued guidance regarding daily intake amounts (DGAC, 2015; EFSA, 2015; Milanez, 
2011; Nawrot et al., 2003; for a summary of the 2015 DGAC conclusions, see Millen et al., 
2016). The most widely cited of these values is from Health Canada (Nawrot et al., 2003), in 
which the agency authors conducted a comprehensive (but not systematic) literature search and 
concluded in a peer-reviewed publication that an intake dose of up to 400 mg caffeine/day was 
not associated with adverse effects in healthy adults. Nawrot et al. (2003) also concluded that 
consumption of up to 300 mg/day for pregnant women and 2.5 mg/kg/day for children is not 
associated with adverse effects.   
Since the Nawrot et al. (2003) article was published, >10,000 papers have been published related 
to caffeine, >5000 of which address effects or exposure in humans. In addition, >800 reviews 
related to various human health effects and caffeine have also been published (i.e., nearly all are 
specific to a particular adverse endpoint category), but a robust, transparent, and systematic 
assessment of the health effects associated with caffeine consumption in humans is not yet

available in the peer-reviewed literature. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review (SR) of 
data published since 2003 and through 2015 to update the review by Nawrot et al. (2003). 
Specifically, our objective was to determine whether the literature published since the 2003 
Health Canada review supports the conclusions that caffeine consumption at amounts up to 400 
mg/day for healthy adults, 300 mg/day for healthy pregnant women, and 2.5 mg/kg-day for 
healthy children is not associated with adverse effects. We also evaluated consumption of 2.5 
mg/kg caffeine/day in adolescents, although this was not specifically addressed by Nawrot et al. 
(2003). 
In developing their conclusions, Nawrot et al. (2003) reviewed many outcomes; however, given 
the voluminous scope, this effort was limited to evaluation of potential effects for five main 
outcomes: (1) acute toxicity (defined herein as abuse, overdose, and potential death), (2) 
cardiovascular, (3) bone and calcium, (4) behavior, and (5) development and reproductive 
toxicity. The areas of genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity were not included. These 
endpoints were selected based on relative importance as documented in other comprehensive 
evaluations (EFSA, 2015; IARC, 1991; Milaneze et al., 2011; Loomis et al. 2016; Nawrot et al., 
2002;) and stakeholder interest. The areas of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics 
(PD) were also of interest but this topic area was not considered to be reviewed systematically; 
rather, information was reviewed to provide contextual evidence (OHAT, 2015a). That is, 
because the general PK/PD of caffeine is well understood, the specific objective was to 
summarize any advances in knowledge. We were particularly interested in any new information 
with respect to differences and similarities between populations of interest, characterization of 
PK in nonadult populations of interest, and characterization of PK in the context of the five main 
areas.

Our SR was conducted using the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) Finding What Works in Health 
Care—Standards for Systematic Reviews as guidance (Eden et al., 2011). This document 
provides standards for (1) initiating a SR, (2) finding and assessing individual studies, (3) 
synthesizing the body of evidence, and (4) reporting SRs. Per the IOM framework, additional 
methods are required for individual study assessment and body of evidence assessment. For these 
aspects, we utilized the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and 
Translation (OHAT) framework for evidence integration (OHAT, 2015a), as well as the OHAT 
Risk of Bias tool (OHAT, 2015b). These references were issued subsequent to project initiation 
but prior to protocol registration, and they were selected for their specific application to 
toxicology (versus clinical medicine). It is anticipated that the transparency in reporting the 
information reviewed, as well as the integrated conclusions, will provide value to scientists and 
stakeholders interested in this issue of caffeine safety. Since Health Canada’s work is so 
commonly referenced in nearly every discussion of caffeine safety, validating whether or not the 
Nawrot et al. (2003) conclusions remain current provides a foundation for establishing an 
acceptable level of protection to the healthy general population. This foundation, in turn, 
provides confidence in assuring the typical healthy caffeine consumer of a reasonable certainty 
of no harm, and it also allows scientists to move away from this question and focus more on the 
sensitive subpopulations that may be at greater risk. It is anticipated that this review will be of 
utility to a variety of stakeholders, including doctors, dietitians and other health professionals in 
guiding their patient populations, as well as consumers interested in understanding caffeine 
safety.

2. Methods 
2.1 Establishing team and protocol development 
The SR was structured using the IOM publication, Finding What Works in Health Care—
Standards for Systematic Reviews as guidance (Eden et al., 2011). Consistent with the IOM-
recommended standards for initiating a review, the first step involved establishing a team with 
appropriate expertise and experience. In addition to eight scientists from ToxStrategies, which 
included a caffeine expert (C.D.) and a SR expert (D.W.), the team also included six scientific 
advisory board (SAB) members with expertise in the following areas: SR (E.M.), caffeine (C.O., 
J.G., J.P., H.R.L., and M.T.), epidemiology (J.P., C.W.), bone and calcium (C.W.), reproduction 
(J.P.), behavior (H.R.L., C.O.), PK (M.T.), acute toxicity (M.T., C.O.), and clinical medicine 
(J.G., M.T., C.O.).  
Each study team member and each SAB member completed a comprehensive conflict of interest 
(COI) questionnaire, which documented both financial and nonfinancial COIs via questions 
regarding investments, employment, consultancies, contracts/grants, 
patents/royalties/trademarks, expert witness testimony, speaking/writing, past financial interests, 
other involvements/relationships, personal beliefs, previously published opinions, institutional 
relationships, career advancement, advocacy/policy positions, other positions, and caffeine 
consumption. COI declarations were reviewed and the relative likelihood of creating bias in 
decision making was evaluated using an internal process documented via “Management of 
Conflicts of Interest within Systematic Review Team and Scientific Advisory Board Members” 
(internal document, established March 2015). This document included actions for situations in 
which a team member was determined to have a high degree of COI, defined in this document 
 MANUSCRIPT

14 
and based on IOM definitions. Declarations were documented in the registered protocols   
(PROSPERO protocol nos. CRD42015026704, CRD42015027413, CRD42015026673, 
CRD42015026609, and CRD42015026736; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/). After 
review of the declared COIs, it was determined, overall, that these would not exert undue 
influence on the primary interest of the SR. The sponsor, the North American Branch of the 
International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI North America), was made aware of and given an 
opportunity to comment on the depth and scope of the SR when there were financial 
implications; however, the review team had independence in making final decisions about the 
design, analysis, and reporting of the SR.  
A protocol for the SR was developed, and elements included (1) context and rationale for the 
review, (2) study selection and screening criteria, (3) descriptions of outcome measures, time 
points, and comparison groups, (4) search strategy, (5) procedures for study selection, (6) data 
extraction strategy, (7) approach for critically appraising individual studies, and (8) method for 
evaluating the body of evidence. A protocol for each outcome was registered on PROSPERO 
(PROSPERO protocol nos. CRD42015026704, CRD42015027413, CRD42015026673, 
CRD42015026609, and CRD42015026736; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/) . In the 
present manuscript, the first element is described in the introduction (Section 1), and the 
remaining elements are discussed in the subsequent text. As described in the introduction, the 
premise for the overall effort was to evaluate the literature published since the Nawrot et al. 
(2003) work to determine whether the conclusions reached by Health Canada were still 
supported by the updated literature.  
The PECO (population, exposure, comparator, and outcome) question for the SR was as follows: 
“For [population], is caffeine intake above [dose], compared to intakes [dose] or less, associated

with adverse effects on [outcome]?” This SR focused on five outcomes (Figure 1): acute, 
cardiovascular, bone and calcium, behavior, and development and reproduction (further 
descriptions of the endpoints included within each of these outcomes can be found in the results 
section of each outcome). A sixth outcome, PK, was included as a contextual topic (literature 
was identified systematically; information was not subject to the individual study assessment and 
body of evidence evaluation described in the protocol, but rather was reviewed and reported in a 
narrative format) consistent with practices described by OHAT (2015a). For PK, the objective 
was to generally characterize the current understanding of caffeine kinetics and critically review 
any information that advances the science, particularly with respect to differences/similarities 
between our populations of interest, characterization of kinetics in children and adolescent 
populations of interest, and characterization of kinetic parameters (particularly fast/slow 
phenotypes) in the context of the outcomes of interest.  
The series of SRs evaluated four populations: healthy adults, healthy pregnant women, healthy 
adolescents (aged 12–19 years), and healthy children (aged 3–12 years). Only studies in humans 
were included (i.e., animal studies were excluded). “Healthy” subjects were defined as 
individuals who were not specifically described as having been hospitalized or diagnosed with 
disease and/or receiving medical treatment for a disease at the time of the study. As such, studies 
evaluating a healthy population (which included athletes, military personnel, and pregnant 
women, unless otherwise noted as unhealthy) were included. Studies in which healthy 
individuals were included as a control group (or similar) as part of a study on unhealthy 
populations (e.g., individuals with asthma) were included; however, only information from the 
healthy individuals was used in the assessment.

For all outcomes except acute, the exposure values in the PECO were 400 mg/day, 300 mg/day, 
and 2.5 mg/kg body weight/day for adults, pregnant women, and adolescents and children, 
respectively; similarly, comparators were ≤400 mg/day for adults, ≤300 mg/day for pregnant 
women, and ≤2.5 mg/kg body weight/day for adolescents and children. Although Nawrot et al. 
(2003) discussed other values in context of each of the outcomes, the selected values were based 
on the overall conclusions they presented. The exposure and comparator dose for lethality (acute 
outcome) was 10 g for adults but was undefined for the other populations based on the lack of a 
comparator from Nawrot et al. (2003). Inclusion and exclusion criteria unique to specific 
outcomes are documented in the PROSPERO registrations. 
2.2 Study screening and selection  
To be included in the SR, studies had to provide a quantitative estimate or measurement of 
exposure to a caffeine source associated with an adverse effect. Forms of caffeine included 
coffee, tea, chocolate, cola-type beverages, energy drinks, supplements, medicines, energy shots, 
caffeinated chewing gum, caffeinated sport gel, and caffeinated sport bars. Studies evaluating the 
effects of caffeine alone, in one of the aforementioned forms, or in combination with one or more 
compounds occurring in the approved sources at amounts designed to match constituents of valid 
sources (e.g., caffeine and green tea extract) were included. Studies that did not provide a 
quantitative exposure to an acceptable caffeine source associated with an adverse effect were 
excluded (e.g., studies that evaluated only decaffeinated coffee/tea and caffeine placebo 
exposures, exposures where participants were expecting caffeine but did not receive the drug, or 
studies that evaluated yerba mate, guarana, damiana [caffeine-containing plant], contaminants of 
caffeine, and/or caffeine metabolites, etc.). Studies that evaluated the effects of caffeine in 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
17 
combination with either another pharmacologically active compound in over-the-counter (OTC) 
pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen plus caffeine) or with nicotine, alcohol, or a prescribed drug 
were excluded. 
To be included, studies had to be peer reviewed and available in English. Only studies evaluating 
exposure and response at the individual amount  were included (e.g., ecological studies were 
excluded).Case reports and case series were included only for the acute outcome and were 
excluded for the other outcomes. Rationale for inclusion of case reports and case series in the 
acute outcome is based on the unique nature of the outcome (i.e., death, rare events) (CRD, 
2009; Fitzpatrick-Lewis et al., 2009) and the lack of data from more reliable study types (which 
would result in an inability to evaluate an outcome that is important to understanding the safety 
of caffeine). Letters to the editor that contained original, peer-reviewed data were included. 
Reviews were excluded from the systematic assessment unless original data, such as meta-
analyses, were reported. Although they are not commonly included in a SR, relevant meta-
analyses were included to inform the PECO (Eden et al., 2011). Selected reviews were also 
retained for context, though a critical appraisal and inclusion of reviews was beyond the scope of 
this assessment. Careful consideration was given to studies evaluating beneficial or therapeutic 
endpoints (referred to as benefit studies); those that reported parameters or effects associated 
with adverse effects in an outcome of interest were included, whereas those only reporting on 
beneficial endpoints were excluded.  
The search strategy was developed via an iterative process involving evaluation, validation, and 
piloting of a variety of databases with syntax unique to each. The process, as well as the final 
strategy, was informed and reviewed by a librarian with expertise in the conduct of SRs. Three 
databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

18 
Reviews (grey literature was not included, primarily due to the volume of primary data 
available). Syntax was developed for each database; terms related to each outcome, as well as 
caffeine, were run in a concatenated fashion (found at: 
http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPEROFILES/26704_STRATEGY_20150829.pdf). Search 
restrictions included default functions for language (English) and data (restricted to publications 
between January 1, 2001 and June 8, 2015). EMBASE searches were exclusive of MEDLINE 
and restricted to selected journals (430 journals were selected based on relevance; expert 
librarian determined an initial list of journals not indexed by PubMed, the list of journals was 
refined by project team members using keywords associated with SR topics and expert 
judgement). The Cochrane library was searched between January 2001 and June 2015 for review 
articles. All databases were searched on June 8, 2015; articles published after this date were not 
considered in the SR.  
Multiple software tools were considered to facilitate the SR; however, given the complexity and 
volume of information reviewed, DistillerSR was selected to facilitate and document screening, 
selection, extraction, and evaluation of data. Results of the search were entered into an EndNote 
database for identification and removal of duplicates and were then uploaded into a DistillerSR 
library. Following a series of pilot screening exercises, multiple evidence analysts conducted the 
full screen of titles and abstracts. In instances where determinations of inclusion/exclusion could 
not be made due to limited information in the title/abstract, the result was included and carried 
forward for full text review. The screening process also involved group review of a large number 
of hits that were deemed by screeners to be ambiguous. A designation of “Needs further 
discussion—Internal” was made on the screening form for these entries and screeners could 
optionally provide more detail on the specific issue in the “Notes” field of the form. These titles 
 MANUSCRIPT

19 
and abstracts were then carefully reviewed and discussed by two or three other members of the 
team before assigning inclusion or exclusion status after consensus. The dynamic screening form 
included categorization of study type and outcome, noting that some studies evaluated multiple 
outcomes. Following completion of the screen, each SAB member was provided a tabular 
summary to conduct a second set of reviews of the included/excluded results.  
Full text articles of all studies identified for potential inclusion following the screen were 
obtained. Some articles were not obtainable with reasonable effort, which involved the following 
hierarchy: search of the National Library of Medicine, direct purchase from the publisher/journal 
(which included inquires to journals when publications could not be readily identified online), or 
request sent to the corresponding author. Evidence analysts were assigned to specific outcomes 
for the subsequent step; extensive piloting exercises were first conducted to refine the individual 
study assessment process (including the data extraction form), as well as to ensure consistency in 
form responses across analysts and outcomes. Analysts then reviewed the full text of each article 
for the assigned outcome; if the article met the inclusion criteria, then the information from the 
study was extracted and the study was evaluated for quality. Data extraction was facilitated via a 
second DistillerSR form that included two sets of information: (1) basic information as reported 
by the author (i.e., direct extraction of information from the text) and (2) customized information 
(i.e., information to inform the PECO questions, dose/exposure calculations, categorization, or 
interpretation applied). Basic information fields included the following: outcome(s) and 
endpoint(s), objective, methods, study design categorization, source of caffeine exposure, 
exposure metric (measured, self-report), population, reference/comparison, confounders, results, 
dose-response evaluation, conclusion, pharmacokinetic information, funding sources, and COIs. 
Customized fields or project-specific fields included the following: standardization of 
 MANUSCRIPT

20 
exposure/dose to SR, selection of endpoints and exposure/dose for comparisons, and information 
related to assessing trends, consistency, and so forth across the body of evidence. During 
extraction, the level of adversity of the endpoints within the study (Guyatt et al., 2011) was also 
characterized. Although they were excluded, studies that were identified as relevant but did not 
quantitatively inform the PECO were identified and categorized as such and, in some cases, were 
used as contextual content. All data extracted were placed in a freely available Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Systematic Review Database Repository (SRDR) 
repository (AHRQ SRDR link forthcoming). It should be noted that much of the information in 
the basic information fields is based on text directly from the authors; given the volume and 
scope of the assessment, significant efforts were not devoted to summarizing such information. 
Following extraction, each SAB member was provided a tabular summary to conduct a second 
set of reviews of the extracted information. 
Because the SR involves comparison of caffeine exposures in the literature to values reported by 
Nawrot et al. (2003), standardization of the exposure metric was a critical step in data extraction. 
The comparators were in a metric of mass per day (mg/day) or mass per day based on body 
weight (mg/kg-day). However, studies in the literature often reported a variety of metrics (e.g., 
milligrams of caffeine, cups of coffee per day, etc.). A decision tree was developed to specify a 
consistent process of recording and standardizing the results as reported by authors to enable 
comparison to the PECO. The process for standardizing the exposure metric can be found in 
Supplementary File S1. When selecting values for comparison to Nawrot et al. (2003), all 
eligible comparisons from a given study were made (i.e., all relevant populations and subgroups 
as well as comparisons for multiple endpoints were selected, if sufficient data were available). ). 
In order to be characterized as an observed effect (i.e., a lowest observed effect level; non-
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

21 
significant findings were characterized as no observed effect levels), the finding had to be 
statistically significant; in cases where multiple results were presented, findings from the most 
sophisticated or refined analysis performed by the authors were selected. Comparators were 
characterized by the SR authors as no observed effect levels (NOELs) and lowest observed effect 
levels (LOELs).  
2.3 Individual study assessment 
Following data extraction, individual studies were assessed for risk of bias (internal validity) 
using the OHAT (2015b) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies. The body of 
evidence was evaluated and integrated using the OHAT (2015a) Handbook for Conducting a 
Literature-Based Health Assessment Using OHAT Approach for Systematic Review an Evidence 
Integration. For graphical purposes, meta-analyses were assigned to the highest-quality end of 
the Risk of Bias spectrum. One refinement to the evaluation of RoB was implemented post 
protocol registration. For selected endpoints in reproduction and development (fetal growth, 
spontaneous abortion, recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm birth and small for gestational 
age), RoB Question 4 (Did the study design or analysis account for important confounding and 
modifying variables) was refined to place emphasis on the pregnancy signal as a confounder (see 
the reproductive and development section and the discussion section for biological significance 
and rationale for placing emphasis on this variable). Because of the known complexities and lack 
of validity in approaches to evaluate the pregnancy signal (Brent et al., 2011; Lawson et al., 
2004; Peck et al., 2010; Stein and Susser, 1991),  many studies were assigned a probably high 
risk of bias based primarily on the methods used to evaluate the pregnancy signal. If authors did 
not attempt to evaluate the pregnancy signal, the study was scored as high risk of bias for this 
element (Q4).

22 
Following extraction of the data, it was determined that guidance beyond that provided by 
OHAT (2015a) or Money et al. (2013) for evaluating individual studies, as well as integrating 
the body of evidence, were required. Thus, we integrated aspects of the commonly applied 
GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) process 
presented by Guyatt et al. (2011). GRADE is a well-established process supported by the IOM 
framework. Specifically, GRADE was used to categorize the level of importance in decision 
making, which, in context of this review was regarded as the level of adverseness (Guyatt et al., 
2011). To do so, endpoints were categorized as (1) physiological or clinical and (2) 
high/medium/low with respect to the level of adverseness. These categorizations were used to 
weight endpoints when developing outcome conclusions. As part of the weight of evidence, 
analysts applied expert judgement in considering how physiological endpoints were related to 
clinical outcomes (e.g., known predictors, etc.), as well as how considerations were made 
regarding the event(s) relative to the progression of the outcome. These efforts were conducted 
on an endpoint (or endpoint grouping),  outcome,  and overall body of evidence.  Several tools 
were used to facilitate and support the evaluation, including generation of evidence tables 
(AHRQ SRDR link forthcoming), risk of bias heat maps, summary plots of selected 
NOEL/LOEL data from individual studies, and a tabular summary of the confidence in the 
evidence for each outcome and endpoint.  
2.4 Body of evidence assessment 
Consistent with the framework established by the IOM (Eden et al., 2011), the body of evidence 
was synthesized qualitatively for each outcome using methods recommended within the IOM 
standards for SR, complemented by those offered by OHAT (2015a) given the specific 
application to toxicological assessments.  In evaluating and conducting a qualitative synthesis the 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

23 
body of evidence for each outcome, findings were summarized relative to the Nawrot et al. 
(2003) comparators of 400 mg/day for adults (10 g for lethality), 300 mg/day for pregnant 
women, and 2.5 mg/kg/day for children and adolescents. Data are described based on the volume 
of data above and below the comparator, as well as the types of effects and quality of evidence of 
data that are above and below the comparator. Also consistent with the IOM framework (Eden et 
al., 2011), confidence in the body of evidence was assessed using the approach determined a 
priori. An initial level of confidence was assigned based primarily on the following key features 
of the study design: controlled exposure, exposure prior to outcome, individual outcome data, 
and comparison group used (OHAT, 2015a).  
Then, using expert judgement, a number of additional factors were considered for the overall 
body of evidence, rendering increases or decreases in the confidence. These factors included the 
following: overall risk of bias, indirectness, magnitude of effect, confounding, and overall 
consistency. With respect to the magnitude of effect, considerations were given both to a) when 
studies observed an effect below the comparator (as reported in Table 1), and b) the overall 
weight of the evidence related to the magnitude, which included both considerations of lack of 
effect (e.g., number of studies without effects, essentially a “0” level of magnitude) as well as 
magnitude in studies reporting effects below the comparator (as reported in the narrative weight 
of evidence conclusions and Table 2).  These factors both help characterize the data as well as 
provide structure for developing a conclusion based on the strength and confidence in the 
underlying body of evidence with respect to effects relative to the comparator (i.e., effects 
relative to a specific intake vs. the potential for effects to occur at any intake). Consideration of 
endpoint importance (Guyatt et al., 2011) or level of adverseness of the endpoints was also 
important in making weight of the evidence conclusions, both for the individual outcomes and 
 MANUSCRIPT

24 
the overall assessment. Typically, this discussion was in the context of classifying endpoints as 
clinical or physiological, and for the latter, if sufficient information is known to interpret 
physiological data relative to clinical outcomes. With respect to evaluation of dose-response, it 
was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for determining confidence in the body of 
evidence relative to the research question, and thus was not included as part of the weight of 
evidence considerations. Because the research question involved evaluation of potential effects at 
or below a specific intake (the comparator), integration of dose-response as a parameter that 
would increase confidence in a body of evidence would require evaluation, primarily, of dose-
response relationships in studies which both (a) reported effects, and (b) reported effects at or 
below the comparator. A number of factors precluded a comprehensive integration of dose-
response across the body of evidence, including, though not limited to: many studies did not 
report effects, many studies that reported effects below the comparator were single dose studies, 
studies which evaluated dose-response did not provide quantitative information that would aid in 
interpretation of such relative to the comparator (i.e, did not provide information as to effects at 
or below the comparator).  Future evaluations could involve targeted evaluation of the strength 
of the bodies of evidence in the context of dose-response relationships for studies reporting 
effects below the comparator. 
Similar to the approach and conclusions of Nawrot et al. (2003), the objective in the weight of 
evidence assessment was not to find the most protective or lowest amount  associated with an 
effect per se, but rather to make a determination based on the body of evidence as a whole, which 
included considerations for positive and negative findings, quality of data, level of adversity, 
consistency, and magnitude of effect (for studies with effects below the comparator). Weight of 
the evidence determinations were made by endpoint and population; specifically, conclusions 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
25 
were developed by categorizing evidence relative to the comparator (an intake value not 
associated with adverse effects) as follows: comparator is acceptable (i.e., evidence supports the 
Nawrot et al. (2003) conclusions regarding intake), comparator is too high (i.e., evidence 
suggests the comparator is too high), or comparator is too low (i.e., evidence suggests the 
comparator could be higher). Using a similar approach, conclusions were also developed for the 
outcome. When developing outcome conclusions, clinical endpoints with a high level of 
adversity were given the most weight.  Conclusions were not developed for endpoints containing 
fewer than five studies; in these instances, summary thoughts are provided but data were 
determined to be insufficient to determine a conclusion. 
3. Results 
Following removal of duplicates, 5706 records of human studies were identified via the multiple 
databases searched (Figure 2). Titles and abstracts were screened for potential inclusion. The 
most common reasons for exclusion during title and abstract review were as follows: outcomes 
not included in the SR (e.g., cancer), unhealthy populations, coexposures, benefit/therapy 
studies, and in vitro studies. Following committee reviews, internal quality-control efforts, and 
SAB review of title and abstract screening, 739 records were carried forward to full text review. 
Based on initial characterizations of the outcome (e.g., cardiovascular, reproductive), analysts 
conducted full text reviews in which the first step was to confirm inclusion/exclusion. The most 
common reason for exclusion following full text review was lack of quantitative information 
required to evaluate the data relative to the comparator (Figure 1) (e.g., reports of positive or 
negative associations, but lack of a specific exposure associated with such). Following full text 
review, a total of 426 studies were included in this SR; a small portion of these studies evaluated 
 MANUSCRIPT

26 
multiple outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular and behavior, or reproductive toxicity and PK) and were 
thus assessed in all appropriate evaluations. Often, a number of endpoints were reported within 
each study (e.g., heart rate and blood pressure in a cardiovascular study). The number of 
endpoints ranged from one to six per study and averaged two endpoints per study.  
Almost half of the studies (42%) specifically evaluated caffeine as a source; the majority of the 
remaining studies evaluated coffee (21%), tea (12%), and soda (9%) as a source of caffeine, 
whereas the other studies evaluated caffeine from energy drinks, chocolate, medicine, and other 
sources. In 77% of the studies, the exposure (dose) of caffeine did not need to be standardized 
(i.e., the author either evaluated caffeine directly or reported findings based on the amount of 
caffeine in the given sources; see Supplementary File S1). In ~5% of the studies, multiple 
metrics were reported—that is, authors reported findings based on both caffeine content/amount 
as well as source amount (e.g., cups of coffee). In these cases, the caffeine-based data were 
utilized in this SR. As such, the amount of caffeine was estimated by applying standard caffeine 
values by source in <20% of the studies. Exposure was measured in 63% of the studies and was 
self-reported in 38%. 
With respect to study type, more than half of the studies (63%) were controlled trials. The 
remaining were observational studies as follows: cohort studies (14%), case-control studies 
(9%), cross-sectional studies (5%), and meta-analyses (2%). Seven percent of the publications 
were case reports or case series, all of which were associated with the acute outcome (these were 
excluded for other outcomes). The majority of the literature (79%) identified and reviewed 
involved adult populations. Literature characterizing the outcomes of interest in other 
populations was much more limited, including studies that involved pregnant women (14%), 
adolescents (aged 12–19 years) (4%), or children (aged 3–11 years) (2%).

In the subsequent sections, the findings for each outcome are reported. Each section is structured 
similarly to provide: (1) an overview of the literature identified for the outcome relative to the 
PECO (Figure 1), (2) narrative reviews of the data by endpoint, and (3) a qualitative body of 
evidence assessment for the outcome. The narrative discussions are intended to be succinct 
summaries, consistent with that provided by Nawrot et al. (2003), characterizing the findings as 
reported in the literature. In-depth critical assessment of individual studies was beyond the scope 
of this SR; however, each study was evaluated for internal validity. Results of the risk of bias 
assessment are provided as figures in each section; color coding was utilized to represent the 
overall area of the spectrum for the study, with dark green representing an overall lower risk of 
bias (and thus higher quality) and dark red representing an overall higher risk of bias (and thus 
lower quality). The internal validity (i.e., study quality) is also considered in the accompanying 
plots of all of the data by endpoint; the size of the symbol represents where the study falls on the 
risk of bias spectrum (with larger symbols indicating a lower risk of bias, and so on). These plots 
are meant to provide a visual display of selected data obtained from the literature that could be 
compared to Nawrot et al. (2003); specifically, these plots include selected effect levels (i.e., 
LOELs), or no effect levels (i.e., NOELs), from each study. For succinctness, only one effect 
level (the LOEL or NOEL) was reported for each endpoint (i.e., all exposure levels not reported 
in plots); full sets of results are provided via AHRQ (SRDR link forthcoming) and were 
considered by evidence analysts in making weight of the evidence conclusions. In some cases, 
levels were reported as a range (e.g., effects observed or not observed in a given quartile of 
exposure; the range of the quartile would be depicted in the plot rather than an upper or lower 
end/midpoint, etc.). The majority of the information collected in this SR is displayed in the plots; 
exceptions include studies reporting on unique endpoints that were not reasonably grouped with

28 
others, and, for brevity, cardiovascular endpoints associated with lower importance and/or 
unknown clinical relevance (as defined by the subject matter expert, J.G.). All data extracted and 
evaluated, however, are publicly available via the AHRQ repository (SRDR link forthcoming).  
Using a weight of evidence approach similar to that of Nawrot et al. (2003), confidence in the 
body of evidence was determined (Table 1) and conclusions were drawn for each of the 
endpoints, outcomes, and populations under investigation when sufficient data were available 
(Table 2). As noted in the methods (Section 2), the objective in the weight of evidence 
assessment was not to find the most protective or lowest level associated with an effect per se, 
but rather to make a determination based on the body of evidence as a whole, which included 
considerations for positive and negative findings, quality of data, level of adversity, consistency, 
and magnitude of effect. Weight of the evidence determinations were made by endpoint and 
population; specifically, conclusions were developed by categorizing evidence relative to the 
comparator (an intake value not associated with adverse effects) as follows: comparator is 
acceptable (i.e., evidence supports the Nawrot et al. (2003) conclusions regarding intake), 
comparator is too high (i.e., evidences suggests potential for effects below the comparator ), or 
comparator is too low (i.e., evidences suggests a lack of effects above the comparator).  
3.1 Bone and calcium 
Of the full text papers we reviewed (Figure 2), 14 studies were included and 26 were excluded. 
With respect to the PECO, all of the included studies involved adult populations (women and 
men; often elderly adult populations), although one study also evaluated adolescents. Many of 
the observational studies were conducted in participants from large cohorts, including, for 
example, the Nurses’ Health Study (Fung et al., 2014). Exposures were typically characterized 
 MANUSCRIPT

29 
using self-reported methods (e.g., food frequency questionnaires) and were based on 
consumption of coffee, soda, tea, and chocolate. Approximately half of the studies evaluated the 
amount of caffeine in these substances as part of the analysis, and the other half did not (thus, the 
amount of caffeine was calculated by the SR authors per the methods in Section 2). Most of the 
studies were observational (including cohort and cross-sectional study types), although 
experimental studies (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) were also included. Common 
variables accounted for in such analyses included age, weight, body mass index (BMI), calcium 
intake, other nutrient intake, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and physical activity level. 
With respect to the comparator of <400 mg/day from Nawrot et al. (2003) (which is equivalent to 
4.2 eight-ounce cups of coffee based on our standardization assumptions), the majority of the 
data points were below this level (Figure 3). Further, most data points were associated with 
evaluations that used categorical exposure groupings (e.g., <1 cup/day, 1–3 cups/day, and >3 
cups/day). The studies that directly evaluated caffeine (i.e., low level of indirectness) were given 
more weight in the body of evidence assessment relative to those that evaluated caffeine via 
consumption of coffee or other substances (e.g., as cups/day) as a determinant in a regression 
model.  
Similar to findings reported by Nawrot et al. (2003), endpoints characterizing the bone and 
calcium outcome included metabolic impacts on calcium homeostasis (n = 2), bone mineral 
density (BMD) and osteoporosis (n = 9), and risk of fracture (n = 6). Effects of caffeine on bone 
are most often associated with increased urinary calcium excretion. However, urinary calcium 
excretion is affected by calcium intake, so calcium intake needs to be considered in the analysis. 
Altered calcium balance through perturbing calcium excretion can influence bone mass. The 
majority of the studies reviewed evaluated associations between caffeine consumption and BMD

or bone mineral content (BMC); in some studies, these data were also used to characterize 
osteopenia and osteoporosis. Results varied by bone site. 
3.1.1 Evaluation of individual studies by endpoint 
3.1.1.1 Risk of fracture and fall 
With respect to fracture and fall, most studies reported a lack of effects, both above and below 
the comparator of 400 mg/day (Figure 3) (Albrand et al., 2003; Fung et al., 2014; Hallstrom et 
al., 2013; Jha et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2014). Hallstrom et al. (2013) reported that consumption of 
≥560 mg caffeine (≥8 cups) was not associated with a higher rate of any fracture or of hip 
fracture in a comprehensive evaluation of long-term coffee consumption in relation to fracture 
risk and BMD in women. In a recent SR and meta-analysis for coffee consumption and risk of 
fractures (Lee et al., 2014), an insignificant relative risk (RR) for coffee consumption and risk of 
fracture (RR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91–1.16; I2, 61.4%; P = 0.001) was reported 
for all studies combined. Results of subgroup analyses indicated contrasting findings by sex; men 
consuming 760 mg/day had a 24% lower risk of fractures, whereas women consuming 190 
mg/day had a 2% higher risk (1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04) of fractures, relative to those who did 
not drink coffee. Estimates increased based on increased consumption; 8 cups of coffee per day 
was reported to be associated with a 54% higher risk of fractures (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.19–1.99). 
This study did not evaluate interactions between caffeine/coffee consumption and calcium 
intake. Hallström et al. (2006) also reported effects below the comparator. The authors reported 
that a daily intake of ≥330 mg caffeine may be associated with a modestly increased risk of 
osteoporotic fractures (RR, 1.20; CI, 1.07–1.35), especially in women with a low intake of 
calcium; when stratified by calcium intake, the increased risk was only significant when calcium

intake was low (<700 mg/day). No trend in increased risk was observed with higher caffeine 
intake in participants with high calcium intake.  
The majority, although not all, of the data on risk of fracture or fall demonstrate a lack of effects 
of caffeine consumption at levels both above (up to 760 mg/day) and below 400 mg/day. 
Evidence of effects below 400 mg/day was of low magnitude (RR, ≤1.20) and was confounded 
by calcium intake; the potential interaction of calcium intake was not accounted for in the study 
reporting the lowest effect level (Lee et al., 2014), and the other study (Hallstrom et al., 2006) 
reporting an effect level below the comparator found in stratified analyses that increased risk was 
only observed under conditions of low calcium intake. Confidence in these data is moderate 
(OHAT, 2015a) (Figure 4; Table 1); findings were generally consistent, and most, although not 
all, studies controlled for calcium intake. As such, the evidence in this SR supports that an intake 
of 400 mg caffeine/day in healthy adult populations, particularly those with adequate calcium 
intake, is not associated with significant concern regarding the risk of fracture and fall. 
3.1.1.2 Bone mineral density and osteoporosis 
Of the seven studies that evaluated BMD, only one reported on levels of caffeine intake above 
the comparator. Barbour et al. (2010) reported that higher caffeine intake of 520.7 mg/day was 
associated with lower cortical and trabecular volumetric BMD in men aged ≥69 years. The 
remaining studies evaluated consumption levels lower than the comparator, the majority of 
which found a lack of effects at exposures ranging from 108 to 300 mg/day (El Maghraoui et al., 
2010; Hallström et al., 2010, 2013; Harter et al., 2013; Rapuri et al., 2001; Wetmore et al., 2008) 
(Figure 3).

32 
Four of these studies, however, also reported effects below the comparator (El Maghraoui et al., 
2010; Hallström et al., 2010, 2013; Rapuri et al., 2001) for some of the endpoints evaluated. 
Among Moroccan men who consumed >285 mg caffeine/day, El Maghraoui et al. (2010) 
reported a decreased association of high coffee consumption with osteoporosis at any site (0.82; 
CI, 0.74-0.91, P<0.05), although there was an increased association with the lumbar spine (1.76; 
CI, 1.08–2.85; P < 0.05) and no association with total hip, the most important site. Study 
subjects with osteopenia and osteoporosis also reported low calcium intake (62% and 75%, 
respectively). Rapuri et al. (2001) reported that the rate of bone loss at the spine was higher in a 
group of high-caffeine consumers compared with low-caffeine consumers (>300 mg caffeine/day 
versus <300 mg caffeine/day, respectively, with percent change in BMD of −1.90 ±  0.97 versus 
1.19 ± 1.08, respectively, at baseline. However, the rate of bone loss at other sites (femoral neck, 
trochanter, total body, and total femur) was not significantly altered in a longitudinal assessment 
of data collected from elderly women aged 66–77 years over a 3-year period (Rapuri et al., 
2001). These authors also conducted a cross-sectional assessment of data, reporting no 
significant differences in BMD, no changes in a number of calciotropic hormones, and changes 
in bone markers in women who consumed >300 mg caffeine/day relative to those who consumed 
<300 mg/day. Similarly, Hallström et al. (2010) reported that consumption of ≥237.5 mg/day 
was associated with a 4% lower BMD of the proximal femur compared to low or nonconsumers 
of coffee in a large population of Swedish men aged 72 years. This finding, however, was not 
observed in women, nor was it modified by calcium intake. Finally, Hallstrom et al. (2013) 
reported that coffee intake of ≥280 mg was associated with a 2%–4% lower bone density, which 
did not translate into an increased risk of fracture (discussed below). These authors also reported 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
33 
a lack of association between consumption of ≥280 mg caffeine with an increased incidence of 
osteoporosis or an incidence of one or two falls in the previous year.  
Collectively, the majority of studies reviewed support that the comparator of 400 mg/day in 
healthy adults is not harmful with respect to BMD and osteoporosis, although more evidence is 
needed for effects of caffeine intake between 200 and 400mg/day given the number of studies 
that reported effects associated with consumption in this range. In the studies reporting effects 
(both below and above the comparator), such effects were typically associated with subgroup 
analyses (e.g., limited to females), were associated with single sites (i.e., impacts not observed at 
all sites evaluated), or were not associated with downstream events (i.e., risk of fracture). In 
addition, although calcium consumption was integrated into most of the analyses, the method for 
doing so varied, which thus contributed to uncertainty in findings because some of the studies 
involved participants with low calcium intake. These factors, along with the use of different 
consumption groupings by study authors, the uncertainty associated with assessing caffeine 
exposure (particularly relative to calcium consumption), and the lack of consistently observed 
effects (above or below the comparator) make it difficult to further refine the conclusion for 
BMD and osteoporosis.  The underlying evidence base is associated with a moderate to low level 
of confidence (Figure 4; Table 1).  
3.1.1.3 Calcium homeostasis  
Two RCTs were reviewed. Heaney and Rafferty (2001) reported that consumption of caffeinated 
beverages (60 or 92 mg caffeine) produced small increases in calcium excretion, which can be 
offset by small increases in calcium intake (15–30 mL [1–2 tablespoons] milk; Rafferty and 
Heaney, 2008). The authors reported that the overall magnitude was sufficiently small such that 
 MANUSCRIPT

34 
the observed changes were not meaningful to the calcium economy (Heaney and Rafferty, 2001). 
Ribeiro-Alves et al. (2003) reported that exposure to 285 mg caffeine resulted in increased 
excretion of calcium in women (described as ≥1-fold; 0.5 ± 0.5 mmol calcium/mmol creatinine 
following caffeine exposure, and 0.2 ± 0.1 mmol calcium/mmol creatinine without caffeine); this 
finding was based on a study population of women who habitually consume a low-calcium diet.  
As only two studies were available, a conclusion was not developed; however, data from these 
two studies suggests that the comparator of 400 mg/day may be too high for physiological 
impacts on calcium homeostasis; however, when calcium intake is considered in concert and, in 
particular, the observation that the physiological changes in homeostasis can be offset by small 
amounts of calcium, the evidence is more supportive that the comparator is acceptable. 
Furthermore, the amount of change observed was well within typical amounts of calcium 
excreted, including in those consuming low-calcium diets (Wu, 2006), which thus supports an 
unlikely impact on calcium economy at the exposure levels evaluated. 
3.1.2 Body of evidence assessment 
The individual studies were generally associated with low risk of bias ratings, with only three 
studies at the lower end of the spectrum toward high risk of bias (Figures 3 and 4; Table 1). The 
study ratings were most impacted by the confidence in exposure assessment. Few studies 
involved direct evaluation of caffeine; rather, studies relied on self-reported estimates of 
consumption of caffeine-containing beverages. The range in the level of indirectness of caffeine 
intake spans from a low level of indirectness (i.e., direct evaluation of  PECO) to a very serious 
level of indirectness. Thus, studies that directly exposed subjects to a known amount of caffeine 
or assessed caffeine using validated measures were given more weight when considering the 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
35 
body of evidence for this outcome (Figure 4); endpoints with higher levels of adversity were also 
given more weight (Table 2). 
The Nawrot et al. (2003) conclusion for the bone and calcium endpoint included both reference 
to an intake of caffeine (<400 mg/day) as well as calcium intake (800 mg/day). Because of the 
lack of consistent reporting of calcium intake (i.e., lack of author-reported data or conclusions 
that directly linked levels of caffeine and levels of calcium), this SR could not make a conclusion 
about the effect of calcium intake on the relation between caffeine intake and calcium balance or 
bone outcomes. For example, Hallström et al. (2006) reported that an increased risk of fracture 
was observed when calcium intake was low (<700 mg/day), but most studies did not do similar 
stratified analyses.  
In studies showing potentially adverse effects of caffeine intake at <400 mg/day, the effect size 
was generally of low magnitude, effects were only observed in some bone sites, or effects were 
observed in subsets of the population, such as women who habitually consume a low-calcium 
diet (El Maghraoui et al., 2010; Hallström et al. 2006, 2010; Lee et al., 2014; Rapuri et al., 2001; 
Ribeiro-Alves et al., 2003). Two controlled trials reported that single exposures of caffeine 
impacted subsequent measures on urinary calcium excretion (Hallstrom et al., 2013; Heaney and 
Rafferty, 2001); these changes were not considered to meaningfully impact the calcium 
economy. It is also notable that when the progression of effects was considered, in some cases, 
authors indicated that early events were not linked to more critical effects. For example, Heaney 
and Rafferty (2001) indicated that the portion of the observed excess calciuria that may be due to 
caffeine can probably be dismissed as being of no consequence to calcium economy, or the 2%–
4% lower bone density observed by Hallstrom et al. (2013)  following consumption of ≥280 mg 
caffeine did not translate into an increased risk of fracture.

In summary, the SR of 14 studies provided evidence to evaluate potential impacts of the 
consumption of 400 mg caffeine/day on the bone and calcium outcome in healthy adults; these 
studies included assessment of the risk of fracture and fall, BMD and osteoporosis, and altered 
calcium homeostasis. When the weight of evidence was considered, the comparator, 400 mg/day, 
was found to be an acceptable intake that is not associated with significant concern regarding 
overt, adverse effects on bone or calcium endpoints, particularly under conditions of adequate 
calcium intake. Although effects were observed at exposures below the comparator they were 
often limited to physiological effects following acute exposure (altered calcium homeostasis), 
and subgroups in analyses of clinical endpoints, including those with low calcium intake. Such 
effects were generally of low magnitude, and/or were of overall low/negligible consequence to 
downstream events. Several studies also reported on a lack of effect on the clinical endpoints 
following chronic consumption below the comparator, as well as above the comparator. Based 
on the underlying study type (11 observational, 2 RCTs, 1 meta-analysis) that constitute this 
evidence base, there is a moderate level of confidence in the research, which supports this 
conclusion. Key limitations that precluded a higher level of confidence were the inability to fully 
accommodate for calcium intake, the high level of indirectness, as well as an uncertainty in 
exposure estimates.  
 
 
3.2 Cardiovascular  
We reviewed 276 full text papers evaluating potential cardiovascular effects of caffeine. A total 
of 202 of these studies were considered to meet the criteria for inclusion in the SR because they

permitted comparison to the Nawrot et al. (2003) conclusions (Figure 2). Of the 73 studies that 
were excluded from direct comparison to the PECO, 16 studies contained information regarding 
potential associations between caffeine consumption and cardiovascular endpoints but did not 
contain sufficient quantitative information to be included. With respect to the PECO, nearly all 
of the included studies involved adult populations, for which the Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator 
of ≤400 mg/day was applied. For the 11 studies involving children (aged 3–12 years), 
adolescents (aged 12–19 years), or both, the Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator of ≤2.5 mg/kg body 
weight was applied. In several studies, “adults” included individuals who were aged 18 or 19 
years (although results could not be separated as such). Although this is in the upper range for 
adolescents, these populations were treated as adults for purposes of the PECO. 
The majority of the included studies (171 of 202) were controlled trials, most of which were a 
randomized, double-blinded, crossover design. Of the remaining 31 studies, 26 were 
observational studies (cohort, case-control, case-crossover, cross-sectional), 4 were meta-
analyses of such studies, and 1 was a meta-analysis of RCTs. In all of the controlled trials but 
one (Christensen et al., 2001), exposures were characterized based on measured values. The 
reverse was the case for the observational studies and meta-analyses—that is, all but the meta-
analysis of controlled trials were based on self-reported exposures (food frequency 
questionnaires). The majority of the controlled trials were of essentially pure caffeine 
administered as a pill/capsule or dissolved in a liquid; however, studies involving exposure to 
caffeine-containing foods or beverages such as chocolate, coffee, tea, soda, or energy drinks or a 
medical/dietary supplement were also included. For the latter studies, the study authors typically 
reported the amount of caffeine in the food/beverage/supplement utilized in the evaluation; for 
studies in which the author did not, the amount of caffeine was calculated by the SR authors per

38 
the methods (Section 2). Exposure in observational studies was based on estimates of total 
caffeine or consumption of one or more caffeinated foods or beverages; for the latter, caffeine 
exposure was calculated by the SR authors. 
For most of the controlled trials, participants fasted or abstained from caffeine consumption for 
some number of hours, generally overnight, prior to caffeine exposure; however, in some studies, 
participants were asked to abstain from caffeine for ≥1 day or not at all (i.e., a satiated state). 
Most controlled trials were also of a single “acute” exposure, whereas a few evaluated “chronic” 
exposures over a few days or weeks. In either case, participants may have been caffeine naïve or 
they may be nonhabitual caffeine or caffeine-containing beverage consumers, whereas other 
participants (in the same or a different study) were classified by amount of regular caffeine 
consumption (e.g., light, moderate, or heavy consumers). Another variation in exposure 
characterization was studies in which participants were “pretreated” for a certain number of days, 
followed by administration of a “challenge” in which the pretreatment or challenge may have 
been caffeine and/or a caffeine beverage versus some type of placebo. Measurements from the 
controlled trials were most commonly collected 30–60 minutes following exposure (with some 
studies also collecting measurements before and after this time interval) to capture effects at 
expected peak plasma concentrations. Finally, most of the controlled trials evaluated few, if any, 
potential confounders, whereas the majority of the observational studies included analyses 
accounting for many common risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g., age, sex, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI). 
With respect to the comparator of ≤400 mg/day from Nawrot et al. (2003), the majority of the 
data points for adults, regardless of the direction of findings, are below the comparator intake. 
For studies of children and/or adolescents, about one-half of the data points are below the

39 
comparator of ≤2.5 mg/kg body weight, again regardless of findings. Most studies were designed 
specifically to evaluate caffeine (typically via direct exposure to caffeine in controlled trials or 
conversion of self-reported consumption of cups of caffeine-containing beverages per day) and 
thus were considered to have a low level of indirectness. 
The majority of the 171 controlled trials evaluated blood pressure (primarily peripheral systolic 
and diastolic; Table 1) and heart rate and, in the latter case, often during or after exercise. For the 
26 observational studies, most evaluated cardiovascular morbidity (e.g., acute myocardial 
infarctions, atrial fibrillation) and/or mortality (e.g., coronary heart disease, stroke). Nawrot et al. 
(2003) also evaluated blood pressure, heart rate, and CVD, as well as arrhythmia and cholesterol. 
However, in this SR, many additional cardiovascular parameters characterizing this outcome 
were evaluated, including aortic stiffness/wave reflection, cerebral blood flow, plasma or urinary 
constituents (e.g., catecholamines, homocysteine), endothelial function, heart rate variability, 
heart rhythm, hemodynamic measurements other than blood pressure and heart rate (e.g., cardiac 
output, stroke volume), and ventricular function (to note, some studies addressed additional, 
unique endpoints). Each of these is discussed in more detail below, and in doing so, 
considerations for the relative importance of the endpoints, or level of adversity, to the outcome 
are considered (Guyatt et al., 2011) (Table 2). Specifically, the hierarchy considered for 
cardiovascular endpoints involved clinical effects (e.g., morbidity and mortality) > important 
physiological endpoints (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) > other physiological endpoints (e.g., 
aortic stiffness and hemodynamic measurements (other than blood pressure and heart rate). The 
data for the other physiological endpoints are discussed in Supplementary File S2.

3.2.1 Summary of individual studies by endpoint 
3.2.1.1 Cardiovascular mortality 
Nine cohort studies were identified that evaluated the association between consumption of 
caffeine from multiple sources or specifically in coffee or tea and the risk of cardiovascular 
mortality (or in two cases, combined mortality and morbidity) (Figure 5A). Six of these studies 
found no association or no increased risk for caffeine intakes ranging from ~95 to 855 mg/day 
(Bertoia and Triche, 2013; Gardener et al., 2013; Greenberg et al., 2008; Happonen et al., 2008; 
Lopez-Garcia et al., 2008; Paganini-Hill, 2011). Of the remaining three studies, one reported an 
increased risk, but only for a specific genotype (Happonen et al., 2006). Happonen et al. (2006) 
reported an increased risk in the incidence of “acute coronary events” (defined by the authors as 
acute myocardial infarction or coronary death) following consumption of >320 mg caffeine/day 
for those with a low-activity catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) genotype (odds ratio [OR], 
>3). In an earlier study, Happonen et al. (2004) reported a j-shaped dose-response curve, with the 
lowest number of acute coronary events (as defined above) associated with moderate coffee 
drinkers (150–320 mg caffeine/day). The RR was significantly higher in heavy coffee drinkers 
(>320 mg caffeine/day) based on 14 years of follow-up (RR, ~1.5), but when limited to 2.5 or 5 
years of follow-up, the RRs were higher in both light coffee drinkers (0.4–150 mg caffeine/day) 
and heavy coffee drinkers (RR, ~2). Finally, Mineharu et al. (2011) reported hazard ratios (HRs) 
for stroke and total CVD mortality, but not for coronary heart disease mortality (differentiated 
based on International Classification of Disease [ICD] codes), that were significantly greater 
than 1 (in the range of 2 or 3) for women who consumed ≥459 mg caffeine/day in coffee as 
compared to women who consumed <22 mg caffeine/day in coffee. The HRs for men were not

41 
significantly greater than 1. Mineharu et al. (2011) also reported that green tea consumption up 
to ≥180 mg caffeine/day was associated with a decreased risk of total CVD, coronary heart 
disease, or stroke mortality as compared to those who consumed <4.3 mg caffeine/day in green 
tea.  
Collectively, the majority of evidence support that 400 mg caffeine/day in healthy adult 
populations is an acceptable intake which is not associated with significant concern for 
cardiovascular mortality. Even at higher intakes up to ~855 mg/day, there are no consistently 
reported effects on mortality; further, several studies, reported findings that are suggestive of 
protective effects. The studies reporting effects, both above and below the comparator, were 
conditional (e.g., observed in subset of data evaluated). There is a moderate level of confidence 
in the body of evidence  (Figure 6; Table 1) supporting these conclusions. 
 
3.2.1.2 Cardiovascular disease morbidity 
Four meta-analyses and 11 cohort, case-control, or case-crossover studies were identified that 
evaluated the association between consumption of caffeine from multiple sources or specifically 
in coffee and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity (or as noted above, two studies combined 
mortality and morbidity), primarily acute or non-fatal myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or 
stroke (Figures 5 and 6). Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) were not evaluated in any of 
the studies in the time frame of this SR, but previous data have been summarized (Pelchovitz and 
Goldberger, 2011). The strongest data come from four meta-analyses identified (Caldeira et al., 
2013; Cheng et al., 2014; Mostofsky et al., 2012; Sofi et al., 2007), which included cohort and/or 
case-control studies. The three smallest assessments (five or six studies each) reported no 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

42 
increased risk in heart failure events or atrial fibrillation at ≥500, ≥700, or ≥1050 mg 
caffeine/day (the latter being in coffee) (Caldeira et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2014; Mostofsky et 
al., 2012). Sofi et al. (2007) also reported no increased risk coronary heart disease (primarily 
acute myocardial infarction) at ≥360 mg caffeine/day in coffee based on their analysis of 10 
cohort studies; however, for the 13 case-control studies evaluated, there was an increased risk of 
coronary heart disease at 275–360 or >360 mg caffeine/day in coffee (ORs, <2). 
For the observational studies, five found no association or no increased risk of myocardial 
infarction, atrial fibrillation, or stroke for caffeine intakes ranging from ~95 to ~1000 mg/day 
(Conen et al., 2010; Floegel et al., 2012; Frost and Vestergaard, 2005; Greenberg et al., 2008; 
Larsson et al., 2011) (Figure 5). Of the remaining six studies, two reported an increased risk, but 
only for a specific genotype. Cornelis et al. (2006) reported an increased risk of nonfatal acute 
myocardial infarction following consumption of ≥400 mg caffeine/day in coffee, but only for 
slow metabolizers of caffeine. Similarly, Happonen et al. (2006) reported an increased risk in the 
incidence of acute myocardial infarction or CVD mortality (referred to collectively as acute 
coronary events) following consumption of >320 mg caffeine/day for those with a low-activity 
COMT genotype. Two other studies reported a significantly increased risk of a nonfatal acute 
myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke within 1 hour of consuming coffee (Baylin et al., 2006; 
Mostofsky et al., 2010); however, the RR was highest at the lowest exposure category evaluated 
(≤95 mg caffeine/day), with a significant negative trend such that the RR was lowest at the 
highest exposure category evaluated (≥360 mg/day and ~>285 mg caffeine/day, respectively). In 
general, ORs or RRs were ~≤2, although they were as high as 3 or 4 in some cases (Baylin et al., 
2006; Happonen et al., 2006).

43 
As noted above, Happonen et al. (2004) reported a j-shaped dose-response curve, with the lowest 
number of acute coronary events (as defined above) associated with moderate coffee drinkers 
(150–320 mg caffeine/day). The RR was significantly higher in heavy coffee drinkers (>320 mg 
caffeine/day) based on 14 years of follow-up (RR, ~1.5), but the RRs were significantly higher in 
both light coffee drinkers (0.4–150 mg caffeine/day) and heavy coffee drinkers (RR, ~2) when 
limited to 2.5 or 5 years of follow-up. Finally, Kabagambe et al. (2007) reported a significant 
association between nonfatal myocardial infarction and consumption of 303–454 or >454 mg 
caffeine/day (ORs <2); however, this is the same starting study population as evaluated by 
Cornelis et al. (2006), in which the elevated RR was limited to slow caffeine metabolizers, and 
the study authors concede that their exclusion criteria resulted in breakage of the case/control 
pairs.  
When the literature on morbidity are considered collectively, and considering the greater utility 
of meta-analyses, evidence support that 400 mg caffeine/day in healthy adult populations is an 
acceptable intake which is not associated with significant concern regarding cardiovascular 
morbidity. Several studies, including findings from two meta-analyses, suggested that the 
comparator is too low – that is, several studies reported a lack of effects above 400 mg/day. All 
comparison points above 400 mg/day were no effect levels; including no effects associated with 
intakes as high as 1050 mg/day. Some studies, including two meta-analyses, however, reported 
effect levels below the comparator (suggesting the comparator is too high), adding complexity to 
the integration of the data. In several cases, associations were observed only in specific 
genotypes, highlighting the potential role of kinetic influence on PD (discussed elsewhere).  
There is a moderate level of confidence in the evidence base. Confidence was increased by the 
low level of indirectness, and the low risk of bias in the individual studies (Table 1).

3.2.1.3 Blood pressure 
More than 100 controlled trials were identified that evaluated the effect of <100 to ~1000 mg 
caffeine/day on different aspects of blood pressure in adults (see Figure 5B). Hypertension, a 
chronically elevated blood pressure, is a known risk factor for CVD (Mozaffarian et al., 2016), 
whereas intermittent blood pressure elevations, such as those associated with exercise, are not. 
The majority of the caffeine studies evaluated peripheral systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
although some studies evaluated (instead of or in addition to) central (aortic) blood pressure, 
mean arterial blood pressure, pulse pressure, or pulse pressure amplification. The results of these 
studies are mixed, with some reporting statistically significant, albeit often small, increases in 
blood pressure at relatively low caffeine exposures (≤100 mg/day), whereas others reported no 
effect on blood pressure at much higher caffeine exposures (≥400 mg/day). The magnitude of 
change was not always reported or was difficult to discern (reported only in figures). However, 
as an example, Syce (2015) reported an observed increase of 0.5 mmHg in peripheral systolic 
blood pressure following ingestion of ~39 mg caffeine in black tea, whereas Ajayi and Ukwade 
(2001) reported observing an increase of ~3–4 mmHg in peripheral systolic blood pressure 
following ingestion of ~40 mg caffeine in instant coffee. Many studies involved exposures to 
100–200 mg caffeine/day to mimic consumption of 1 or 2 cups of coffee, with some studies 
reporting a significant increase in blood pressure and others not. One meta-analysis of 16 
randomized control studies of coffee or caffeine reported a significant increase in blood pressure 
associated with consumption of ≥410 mg caffeine/day for at least 7 days as compared to those 
who consumed <410 mg/day (Noordzij et al., 2005). The majority of the authors reporting a 
significant increase in blood pressure did not comment on whether the magnitude of change 
represented an adverse effect in healthy adults, except perhaps for individuals who already had 
 MANUSCRIPT

45 
elevated blood pressure. Thus, similar to that reported by Nawrot et al. (2003), the data from this 
SR demonstrated that many controlled studies report statistically significant increases in blood 
pressure as a result of caffeine exposures below 400 mg/day, although the magnitude of change 
is often small (or even very small; <1 to a few mmHg) and transient in nature, and many other 
studies do not report significant changes to blood pressure at exposures up to or exceeding 400 
mg/day.  
Two cohort studies were also identified that evaluated the effect of caffeine or coffee 
consumption on different aspects of blood pressure in adults (Del Brutto et al., 2014; 
Vlachopoulos et al., 2005). Neither reported an association between increased blood pressure and 
consumption of >180 mg caffeine/day in coffee or >200 mg caffeine/day, respectively. All of the 
exposure categories evaluated in these two studies were below the comparator of ≤400 mg/day. 
Five controlled trials were identified that evaluated the effect of 1–5 mg/kg caffeine on blood 
pressure in children and/or adolescents (Temple and Ziegler, 2011; Temple et al., 2014; Turley 
and Gerst, 2006; Turley et al., 2007, 2008). A statistically significant increase in blood pressure 
was observed in all of these studies except Turley et al. (2007) (on the order of a few mmHg); 
effects were observed at doses below 2.5 mg/kg in two of the studies and above 2.5 mg/kg in two 
of the studies. No significant effect was observed in blood pressure following ingestion of 5 
mg/kg caffeine in a study of 7- to 9-year-old boys (Turley et al., 2007), although blood pressure 
was consistently higher (~3–4 mmHg) as compared to controls. In addition, Savoca et al. (2004) 
observed a significant increase in blood pressure in African American adolescents who 
consumed a controlled diet containing >100 mg caffeine (>1.7 mg/kg) for 3 days as compared to 
those who consumed 0–50 mg/day (0.85 mg/kg) or >50–100 mg/day (>0.85–1.7 mg/kg); 
however, no effect was observed in white adolescents at any exposure level. Finally, one cross-

sectional study was also identified, in which Reddy et al. (2008) found no association between an 
average dietary caffeine exposure of ~0.35 mg/kg and blood pressure in African American girls 
aged 6–11 years, which is well below the comparator of ≤2.5 mg/kg. 
Taken together, studies were relatively consistent in demonstrating that exposures to caffeine, at 
intakes both below and above the comparator, have the potential to result in an increase in blood 
pressure (often only a few mmHg) in all populations evaluated. The biological significance of 
this small magnitude of change is difficult to interpret relative to the determination of adverse 
effects, because such a determination is likely to be conditional. Several aspects were critical to 
interpreting the level of adversity. First, the range of normal blood pressure variation during the 
day exceeds the increase that is associated with caffeine (Mancia (2012). Second, in some cases, 
transient increases in blood pressure may not be harmful; for example, blood pressure is 
increased during exercise, which is associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. The blood 
pressure increase with exercise is typically substantially greater than that observed with caffeine 
(Miyai et al., 2002). Third, a decrease in heart rate following caffeine consumption is believed to 
be in response to an increase in blood pressure; as discussed below, consistent changes in heart 
rate were not observed following caffeine consumption. Similarly, the long-term effects of 
transient caffeine-mediated blood pressure increase are unknown relative to the potential impact 
on known cardiovascular risk factors, such as chronic hypertension. Lastly, some data indicate 
the potential for unique subgroups of individuals to demonstrate greater blood pressure 
sensitivity to caffeine than other subgroups. When the evidence is considered collectively, 
findings suggest that the comparator of 400 mg/day in healthy adults is too high if one is only 
considering the potential for caffeine to cause a physiological change in blood pressure (which 
may or may not be adverse). When considering the small magnitude of changes in this

47 
physiological parameter, as well as the lack of information demonstrating an association between 
chronic caffeine-mediated blood pressure increases relative to known cardiovascular risk factors, 
the comparator of 400 mg/day is likely acceptable.  There is a moderate to high level of 
confidence in the underlying data for this endpoint, primarily driven by the low risk of bias and 
use of controlled exposures (RCTs). However, confidence in determining conclusions relative to 
the comparator is limited by the inability to ascertain the conditions and magnitude of change 
that would be considered adverse in a clinical or toxicological context (which is beyond the 
scope of this assessment).  
Similar to the findings in adults, some data suggest that the comparator of 2.5 mg/kg/day in 
children is too high if only the potential for caffeine to cause a physiological change in blood 
pressure (which may or may not be adverse) is being considered; other data suggested that the 
comparator was too low, as no changes were observed following ingestion of 5 mg/kg. When 
considering the small magnitude of changes in this physiological parameter, as well as the lack 
of information demonstrating an association between chronic caffeine-mediated blood pressure 
increases relative to known cardiovascular risk factors, evidence shifts to support the comparator 
of 2.5 mg/kg/day. There is a moderate to high level of confidence in this body of evidence; 
confidence is limited by inconsistency of findings. Thus, results indicate that it would be prudent 
to evaluate blood pressure in children and/or adolescents with significant caffeine intake and 
consider limiting this for those with significant caffeine-mediated blood pressure rise. 
3.2.1.4 Heart rate 
More than 20 controlled trials were identified that evaluated the effect of <100 to ~750 mg 
caffeine/day on heart rate in adults, often during or after exercise (Figure 5D). The results of

these studies are mixed, although the majority of studies reported a lack of effect. Some studies 
reported decreases in heart rate at caffeine exposures of ≤100 mg/day, whereas many others 
reported no change in heart rate at caffeine exposures of ≥400 mg/day. The magnitude of change 
was often not reported or only reported in figures; however, as an example of a study that 
addresses such, Scholey and Kennedy (2004) reported observing a decrease of ~5 bpm following 
consumption of 75 mg caffeine. Heart rate was often, but not always, significantly increased 
during or after exercise at a wide range of caffeine exposures (Figure 5D), with the reported 
increase in these studies considered to be a beneficial (i.e., performance-enhancing) effect (heart 
rate increase during exercise is a key mechanism to improve cardiac output).  
Two observational studies were also identified that evaluated the effect of caffeine or coffee 
consumption on heart rate (Brathwaite et al., 2011; Vlachopoulos et al., 2005). One study 
reported no association between heart rate and consumption of >180 mg caffeine/day in coffee, 
whereas the other study reported an increased likelihood of self-reporting an increased heart rate 
within 12 hours of consuming one caffeine-containing beverage only in individuals with the 
COMT Met/Met polymorphism (slower breakdown of catecholamines) who consume >200 mg 
caffeine/day.  
One meta-analysis of 16 randomized control studies of coffee or caffeine reported no effect on 
heart rate associated with consumption of ≥410 mg caffeine/day for at least 7 days as compared 
to those who consumed <410 mg/day (Noordzij et al., 2005). 
Six controlled trials were identified that evaluated the effect of 1–6 mg/kg caffeine on heart rate 
in children and/or adolescents (Jordan et al., 2014; Temple et al., 2014; Temple and Ziegler, 
2011; Turley et al., 2007, 2008; Turley and Gerst, 2006) (Figure 5E). A significant decrease in 
 MANUSCRIPT

49 
heart rate (~4–6 bpm change) was observed in all of these studies but one, with two studies 
testing dose levels below 2.5 mg/kg and three testing dose levels above 2.5 mg/kg. The 
magnitude of change was again difficult to consistently discern (e.g., information in graphical 
format); however, one study reported a decrease of ~5 bpm (Turley et al., 2008). The one 
exception was a study by Jordan et al. (2014) of elite youth soccer players, in which no change in 
heart rate was observed following consumption of 6 mg/kg caffeine after a standard warm-up or 
subsequent reactive agility tests. 
When the evidence for potential changes to heart rate is considered collectively, data support that 
the comparator of 400 mg caffeine/day in healthy adults is acceptable as an intake which is not 
associated with meaningful concern regarding adverse effects on heart rate. There is a moderate 
to high level of confidence in this evidence base (Figure 6; Table 1). Confidence in determining 
conclusions relative to the comparator is limited by the inability to ascertain the conditions and 
magnitude of change that would be considered adverse in a clinical or toxicological context 
(which is beyond the scope of this assessment). For children and adolescents, data support a 
relationship between caffeine exposure and decreased heart rate; however, further 
characterization of exposures associated with such were difficult, given that changes were 
observed in studies both below and above the Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator of 2.5 mg/kg— 
yet no changes were observed in a study involving exposure to 6 mg/kg. Thus, it was determined 
that the evidence base was insufficient to render a conclusion regarding appropriateness of the 
comparator for potential impacts of caffeine consumption on heart rate in children and 
adolescents.

3.2.1.5 Cholesterol 
Seven controlled trials were identified that evaluated the effects of 180–475 mg caffeine/day on 
serum cholesterol (Bloomer et al., 2013; Christensen et al., 2001; Davies et al., 2003; Kempf et 
al., 2010; Mougios et al., 2003; Namdar et al., 2006; Yukawa et al., 2004). Increased total serum 
or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a well-recognized risk factor for CVD 
(Mozaffarian et al., 2016). Three studies were of caffeine, and the remaining studies were of 
caffeinated coffee or tea. A significant increase in total cholesterol was observed following 
consumption of ≥380 mg/day caffeine in filtered coffee for 4–6 weeks (no effects at 95–285 
mg/day) (Christensen et al., 2001). In contrast, Kempf et al. (2010) reported no significant 
effects of consumption of 238 or 475 mg caffeine on total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol, 
respectively, and reported significant increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
(considered a beneficial effect) at consumption of 238 mg/day (Kempf et al., 2010). A significant 
increase in the HDL/total cholesterol ratio, which is also considered a beneficial effect, was 
observed following consumption of 283 mg or 392 mg caffeine (in females and males, 
respectively) (Mougios et al., 2003). The magnitude of observed change in these studies was on 
the order of 10–20 mg/dL. No changes or significant decreases in cholesterol (in the latter case, 
total or LDL cholesterol) were observed in the remaining four studies of caffeine, coffee, or tea 
associated with lower caffeine intakes of 180–250 mg/day for a single day or up to 12 weeks.  
The results of three cohort studies are inconsistent. Vlachopoulos et al. (2005) observed a 
significant increase in total cholesterol in participants with self-reported consumption of <80, 
80–180, and >180 mg caffeine/day in coffee; however, no dose-response was observed. LDL 
cholesterol was significantly higher only in the highest exposure category (>180 mg caffeine/day 
in coffee). In contrast, Trovato et al. (2010) did not observe changes in total, HDL, or LDL 
 MANUSCRIPT

51 
cholesterol in participants with self-reported consumption averaging 95 mg caffeine/day in 
espresso. Del Brutto et al. (2014) also did not observe changes in total cholesterol in participants 
with self-reported caffeine consumption of up to >200 mg/day. Thus, for the controlled trials, a 
significant increase in total cholesterol was observed only in the two studies of relatively high 
caffeine consumption (≥380–475 mg/day), and one of the three cohort studies reported a 
statistically significant increase in total cholesterol following self-reported exposures to <80, 80–
180, and >180 mg caffeine.  
More than other endpoints evaluated, data are relatively consistent in showing a lack of effect of 
caffeine consumption on cholesterol at intakes below and above the comparator (Figure 5F), thus 
supporting that for cholesterol, 400 mg/kg is an acceptable comparator in healthy adults (Table 
2). There is a moderate to high level of confidence in the evidence base supporting this 
conclusion (Figure 6; Table 1). 
3.2.1.6 Heart rate variability 
Twelve controlled trials were identified that evaluated the effect of ~40–500 mg caffeine/day on 
heart rate variability in adults (Bonnet et al., 2005; Gershon et al., 2009; Karapetian et al., 2012; 
Nishijima et al., 2002; Ragsdale et al., 2010; Rauh et al., 2006; Richardson et al., 2004; Ronen et 
al., 2014; Sondermeijer et al., 2002; Syce, 2015; Waring et al., 2003; Yeragani et al., 2005). 
Most subjects were habitual consumers of caffeine or coffee, whereas others were relatively 
caffeine naïve or not specified. The results from these studies were not consistent (Figure 5G). 
Five studies did not observe an effect on resting heart rate variability at exposures ranging from 
~40 to 300 mg caffeine/day (Nishijima et al., 2002; Ragsdale et al., 2010; Rauh et al., 2006; 
Syce, 2015; Waring et al., 2003), although two of these studies (Nishijima et al., 2002; Waring et 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
52 
al., 2003) did report effects during exercise following exposure to 300 mg caffeine/day (cycling 
or hand grip exercises, respectively).  
The remaining seven studies all reported significant changes in one or more measures of heart 
rate variability, with lower exposures (100–200 mg/day) resulting in significant decreases 
(Gershon et al., 2009; Ronen et al., 2014; Sondermeijer et al., 2002) and higher exposures 
(~350–500 mg/day) resulting in significant increases (Bonnet et al., 2005; Karapetian et al., 
2012; Richardson et al., 2004; Yeragani et al., 2005). Thus, caffeine exposures in the range of 
400 mg/day generally resulted in increases in low (LF) and high frequency (HF) power, LF/HF 
ratio, or total power, whereas lower exposures appear to result in decreases in HF or the standard 
deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). The exception was Bonnet et al. (2005), who observed an 
increase in LF/HF ratio following consumption of 400 mg/day. The magnitude of observed 
changes is also difficult to compare across studies because of the variety of metrics used to 
evaluate heart rate variability, and it is difficult to discern in some cases because the data are 
only reported in figures. However, as an example, Sondermeijer et al. (2002) observed an 
average decrease in SDNN of approximately 16 or 17 milliseconds (~23–24%) following 
consumption of 100 or 200 mg caffeine, respectively.  
When the evidence is considered collectively, there was no consistent effect of caffeine on HRV 
at intakes below or above the comparator, thus supporting that 400 mg caffeine/day in healthy 
adults is an acceptable intake which is not associated with significant change in heart rate 
variability. There is a moderate to high level of confidence in the data (Figure 6; Table 1).

3.2.2 Body of evidence assessment 
Overall, the initial confidence in the body of evidence is high (OHAT, 2015a), as studies 
involved controlled exposures or exposure prior to the outcome, data were reported based on 
individual outcomes, and comparison groups were used in the studies evaluated. The low risk of 
bias scores and low level of indirectness increase confidence in the overall body of evidence (see 
Figure 6). The majority of the 202 studies addressing the cardiovascular effects of caffeine 
reviewed in this SR were associated with a “definitely low” or “probably low” risk of bias, with 
only 5 studies associated with a “probably high” risk of bias (Figure 6; Table 1). Similarly, most 
studies were associated with a low level of indirectness. This is primarily due to the fact that 
most studies were RCTs specifically designed to assess cardiovascular effects of pure caffeine. 
All of the observational studies but one were associated with a “probably low” risk of bias 
(rather than “definitely low,” primarily because of uncertainty in the exposure level), which were 
all based on self-reported consumption. The magnitude of the effects, when observed at all, was 
often small. It is likely that some of the inconsistency observed with the observational studies 
was due to classification of exposure based on self-reported information, although most authors 
relied on validated questionnaires and controlled for the most common confounders (e.g., age, 
weight, smoking status).  
Based on their review of data published prior to this SR, which focused on five endpoints (blood 
pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, arrhythmia (unspecified), and CVD), Nawrot et al. (2003) 
concluded “that moderate caffeine intake (≤400 mg caffeine day−1) does not adversely affect 
cardiovascular health. There are insufficient epidemiological data to draw any conclusions about 
the risk for coronary heart disease or mortality associated with consumption of 10 or more cups 
 MANUSCRIPT

54 
of coffee per day (≥1000 mg caffeine/day).” The current body of evidence characterizing this 
outcome, which consisted of 202 studies, demonstrates that caffeine can cause a variety of 
physiological effects on the cardiovascular system at consumption levels below 400 mg/day for 
adults and 2.5 mg/kg for children and adolescents. However, these effects are often very small 
(although statistically significant), are transient in nature, and may affect only specific subsets of 
the population (specific genotypes), and at least some habitual caffeine consumers develop 
tolerance over time. For some endpoints, the results were fairly consistent across studies (e.g., 
blood pressure, aortic stiffness, cerebral blood flow), whereas for other endpoints, the results are 
mixed (e.g., heart rate, catecholamines). For two endpoints (i.e., endothelial function and heart 
rate variability), the results, in some cases, were even counterintuitive (e.g., changes associated 
with beneficial effects, or detrimental effects, are observed at low exposures but not at higher 
exposures). For some endpoints (i.e., endothelial function and heart rate variability), the results, 
in some cases, suggested that there might be a more complex relationship between dose and 
response, such that directional changes at low exposures differed from those at higher exposures. 
Such complexities underscore the limitations of characterizing potential long-term effects of 
caffeine exposure on cardiovascular health based on short-term (often single-exposure) 
controlled trials. 
The majority of observational studies of clinical endpoints suggest that consumption of caffeine 
was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. When 
statistically significant effects were observed below the comparator, the magnitude was low 
(ORs, RRs, or HRs were generally below 2 but ranged as high as 3 or 4 in some studies), and 
most showed either a j-/u-shaped or negative dose-response curve.

In summary, the SR of 191 studies evaluated the potential for caffeine to be associated with 
adverse cardiovascular effects, including mortality, morbidity, blood pressure, heart rate, 
cholesterol, and heart rate variability (and others; see Supplementary File S2). When the weight 
of evidence was considered, with particular emphasis on level of adversity, 400 mg caffeine/day 
was found to be an acceptable intake which is not associated with significant concern regarding 
adverse cardiovascular effects in healthy adults. For clinical endpoints, some findings suggested 
that the comparator was too low; however, other data, particularly those for physiological 
endpoints, reported effects below the comparator. For such physiological endpoints (e.g., blood 
pressure), confidence in determining conclusions relative to the comparator was limited by the 
inability to ascertain the conditions and magnitude of change that would be considered adverse in 
a clinical or toxicological context. There is a moderate to high level of confidence (Table 1) in 
this evidence base.   
Data in children and adolescents were limited to 11 studies that evaluated physiological 
endpoints. As such, it was determined that the evidence base was insufficient to render a 
conclusion regarding appropriateness of the comparator for potential impacts of caffeine 
consumption on cardiovascular outcomes in these populations. The available data for blood 
pressure and heart rate are inconsistent; several studies report physiological changes below the 
comparator, although some studies reported a lack of effect on these parameters following 
consumption of ≥5 mg/kg/day. 
3.3 Behavior 
The full text review of the behavior literature began with 204 published studies, of which 81 
were ultimately included and 123 were excluded (Figure 2). Of the excluded papers, 66 were

56 
“association” studies, containing contextual information but with no available quantitative value 
of caffeine. Of the remaining studies, 57 met some other exclusion criteria (e.g., unhealthy study 
population, no data on adverse effects, etc.) or could not be retrieved (n = 3 papers). The 
majority (approximately 77%) of the included papers were controlled trials using healthy adult 
populations and only five of the included studies specifically investigated the adverse effects of 
caffeine in child or adolescent populations (although >40 studies were identified, but not 
included, as having qualitative information). Effects in the younger populations will be discussed 
separately from the effects in adults. Of the controlled studies, 51 administered some form of 
pure caffeine, whereas the rest provided caffeine in the form of coffee, energy drinks, or some 
other source. The remainder of the included studies were cross-sectional (n = 12) and cohort (n = 
6) studies in addition to a single case-control study, and caffeine exposure was self-reported in 
all of them. Most of the analyses were conducted using categorical groupings of caffeine 
exposure such as high versus low consumption or a cups-per-day metric. Overall, two-thirds of 
the studies reviewed directly evaluated the amount of caffeine as part of the analysis and 
association with the endpoints, whereas for the remaining third, the amount of caffeine for 
comparison was calculated per the methods in this paper (Section 2). 
In studies in which multiple variables or confounders were accounted for, smoking, age, and 
gender were often covariates. Other more specific variables such as anxiety sensitivity or sleep 
behavior were also sometimes considered, depending on the endpoint objective. By design, the 
clinical studies that comprise the majority of the results herein, regardless of the findings, 
evaluated doses at or below the 400 mg/day intake put forward for adults in Nawrot et al. (2003) 
(Figure 7). Because most of the studies were clinical trials and/or evaluated the effects of 
 MANUSCRIPT

57 
caffeine specifically, the overall level of indirectness for the body of evidence is low; as such, 
these controlled studies provide more weight in the assessment relative to others. 
The endpoints characterized in the behavior outcome fall into several major categories: mood, 
sleep, withdrawal, and headache, generally mirroring the endpoints in Nawrot et al. (2003). One 
exception is risk-taking behavior (e.g., licit or illicit drug use or behavioral problems), which is 
discussed herein and has become particularly more prominent as an area of interest in 
adolescents and young adult populations, resulting from the rise in popularity of energy drink 
consumption in these cohorts (Skewes et al., 2013). Notably, the majority of the studies 
identified on risk taking did not provide a quantitative caffeine value for a comparison to the 
intake level in Nawrot et al. (2003) and thus were excluded; however, a brief mention of these 
studies is provided as context to the findings. For brevity, endpoints considered to be less 
adverse, such as effects on hunger, self-reported bruxism, or others with low information, are not 
discussed but were reviewed and can be found in the supplementary material via AHRQ (SRDR 
link forthcoming). 
3.3.1 Summary of individual studies by endpoint 
3.3.1.1 Mood 
The category of “mood” was subdivided, consisting primarily of studies on the relationship 
between caffeine intake and anxiety, but also includes effects on other general mood states. 
Collectively, these are usually measured by questionnaires, such as the Profile of Mood States 
(POMS), that gauge items such as vigor, depression, fatigue, anger, and confusion, along with 
anxiety. These dimensions represent normal, nonclinical mood states and changes in them do not 
necessarily indicate negative effects. Furthermore, although the POMS (for example) was 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

58 
developed to measure multiple dimensions of baseline and transient moods, an intercorrelation 
between scores for some of the factors has been observed, indicating that these do not change 
independently (McNair et al., 1981; Norcross et al., 1984). Mood states such as alertness and 
vigor have repeatedly been shown to be positively affected by caffeine at a wide range of doses 
but these have not been reviewed here because they are not adverse effects (Lieberman, 2001; 
Ruxton, 2008).  
3.3.1.1.1 Anxiety in adults 
Forty controlled trials were identified that evaluated the effects of 70–1200 mg caffeine/day on 
some aspect of anxiety (Figure 7A) in adults. Most of these studies used questionnaires, such as 
the POMS or visual analogue scales (VASs), to measure subjective effects on anxiety, including 
effects on state measures such as “tension,” “jitteriness,” “nervousness,” and “worry,” depending 
on the study design and type of questionnaire. Consideration must also be given to the possibility 
that some of these subjective effects categorized as anxiety may also be related to caffeine’s 
ability to increase alertness and arousal (Nawrot et al., 2003).  
The results of the five studies evaluating effects of caffeine at the lower end of the range (<100 
mg) largely indicate no or little effect on anxiety. One study reported a small but statistically 
significant increase in anxiety from doses of caffeine as low as 80–87 mg (Vinader-Caerols et 
al., 2012); however, the others that administered doses just below this range (70–80 mg) in the 
form of coffee, tea, or other caffeine sources did not report any significant change (Botella and 
Parra, 2003; Sünram-Lea et al., 2012; Tinley et al., 2003; Young and Benton, 2013). The 
majority of the remaining controlled trials administered single doses of caffeine between 100 and 
400 mg/day and reported mixed results. Although nine investigations reported no anxiogenic

59 
effect of single caffeine doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg (Harrell and Juliano, 2009; Haskell et 
al., 2008; Hewlett and Smith, 2007; Keenan et al., 2014; Pallarés et al., 2013; Stafford and 
Yeomans, 2005; Watson et al., 2002; Yoto et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014), 12 other studies have 
shown statistically significant increases, of varying magnitude, in measures of anxiety following 
ingestion of caffeine in this dose range (Arciero and Ormsbee, 2009; Attwood et al., 2007; Brice 
and Smith, 2002; Marczinski et al., 2014; Omvik et al., 2007; Peeling and Dawson, 2007; Rogers 
et al., 2008; Salinero et al., 2014; Sands et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2002; Sigmon and Griffiths, 
2011; Smith et al., 2012). Of the seven controlled studies using doses above 400 mg/day, just 
two found no effect of caffeine on anxiety measures (James and Gregg, 2004; Nardi et al., 2007), 
although it should be noted that James and Gregg administered the caffeine dose as 1.75 mg/kg 
body weight three times per day. The remaining five high-dose caffeine (i.e., >400 mg/day) 
studies demonstrated that caffeine significantly increased some aspect of anxiety (Bonnet and 
Arand, 2003a; Killen et al., 2013; Motl and Dishman, 2004; Nardi et al., 2009; Pallarés et al., 
2013). A single observational study was identified that characterized the effects of caffeine on 
anxiety. Using a logistic regression analysis, Trapp et al. (2014) found that consumption of 
energy drinks in young adult males, equivalent to approximately 83 mg caffeine/day (100 
mL/day), was associated with an increase in anxiety (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03–1.48) and stress 
scores (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.45); no such effects were observed in females.  
Taken together, some but not all evidence, primarily from RCTs involving single/short term 
caffeine exposure and subjective measures of anxiety, suggests that the comparator of 400 
mg/day can lead to increases, albeit small, in measures of anxiety in adults.  Evidence suggests 
that some of the variability in findings may be due to individual variation in the response to 
caffeine. Much of the variation in response, including the magnitude and sensitivity of its effects, 
 MANUSCRIPT

60 
may be attributed to other factors such as genotype (e.g., ADORA2a receptor TT genotype 
polymorphisms), consumer status (e.g., studies that involve participants with genetic 
predispositions or participants who do not regularly consume caffeine tend to report effects 
below the comparator), and subjectivity inherent to the evaluation of anxiety (e.g., POMS). This 
later point being notable when considering the level of adversity of the reported changes in 
anxiety –the often-small changes observed were considered to be of low magnitude. These 
findings highlight the need for additional research to further characterize population-based 
sensitivities based on genotype and consumption status. 
3.3.1.1.2 Anger and confusion in adults 
As mentioned above, the POMS questionnaire and the VAS can be used to measure 
anger/hostility and confusion/bewilderment among other mood states (McNair et al., 1981). Nine 
controlled studies reported the effects of 70–1200 mg caffeine/day on anger, seven of which 
assessed doses less than 400 mg. Similar to the findings in Nawrot et al. (2003), none of these 
seven studies identified a negative effect of <400 mg caffeine on levels of anger/hostility 
(Arciero and Ormsbee, 2009; Denson et al., 2012; Harrell and Juliano, 2009; Marczinski et al., 
2014; Tinley et al., 2003; Yoto et al., 2012; Young and Benton, 2013). With respect to the two 
studies that administered >400 mg/day, findings were mixed. James and Gregg (2004) 
administered caffeine three times daily for 7 days and found that in well-rested individuals, a 
cumulative dose of 420 mg caffeine/day resulted in no significant effect on negative mood states, 
including anger/hostility. However, at a much higher dose level, Bonnet and Arand (2003) 
reported that 1200 mg caffeine/day (administered as 400 mg, three times daily) did produce a 
statistically significant increase in POMS anger scores following 7 days of caffeine treatment.

Mood states related to confusion (including muddled, difficulty concentrating, and 
bewilderment) were measured in 11 controlled trials. Nine of these studies used caffeine doses 
ranging from 70 to 400 mg. Six of these studies using ≤400 mg determined that there was no 
negative effect of caffeine on measures of confusion/bewilderment (Arciero and Ormsbee, 2009; 
Harrell and Juliano, 2009; Liguori and Robinson, 2001; Stafford and Yeomans, 2005; Tinley et 
al., 2003; Yoto et al., 2012) and one study (Juliano et al., 2012) indicated an improvement in this 
endpoint. One exception was the study by Marczinski et al. (2014), who found that consumption 
of a 2-ounce, 5-hour energy shot containing 200 mg caffeine resulted in an increase in subjective 
ratings of confusion/bewilderment 40 minutes after dosing, which was evident when compared 
to the “no beverage” group but was not significant when compared to the placebo beverage 
condition. The second exception was Young and Benton (2013), who found that subjects 
reported an increase in confused mood following consumption of 80 mg caffeine administered 
with water, but researchers observed no such effect, or an improvement, when caffeine was 
delivered with other vehicles such as glucose or yogurt, respectively. The authors speculated that 
there is a possible influence of caffeine vehicle on mood, which is related to the glycemic index 
(i.e., a lower glycemic index is more likely to be associated with observed benefits). Findings 
from the two studies that evaluated doses of caffeine above 400 mg (also discussed above) 
differed. In the first study, James and Gregg (2004) reported that 420 mg caffeine/day resulted in 
a significant increase in confusion/bewilderment scores and an overall decrement in mood after 
caffeine consumption. In the other study, Bonnet and Arand (2003) reported increasing 
dysphoria (general unhappiness) but no significant effect on confusion scores in subjects over the 
course of a 7-day, 1200-mg/day (administered as 400 mg, three times daily) caffeine protocol 
designed to produce insomnia by increasing physiological arousal in moderate caffeine

62 
consumers. Here, the authors suggested that the adverse changes in mood are related to the 
insomnia induced by the caffeine consumption (see more on this study in Section 3.3.1.3 on 
sleep). Following a 2-night withdrawal phase (after the 7-day caffeine protocol), however, scores 
for anger, depression, and confusion were, in fact, increased (Bonnet and Arand, 2003a).  
Overall, the evidence, which is primarily based on data obtained from short term/single exposure 
trials, suggests that the comparator of 400 mg/day is an acceptable intake that is not associated 
with significant concern regarding anger and confusion mood states in adults (Figure 7B).  The 
majority of data showed a lack of effects following exposure; some studies reported effects at 
intakes both above and below the comparator, particularly during a withdrawal phase – such 
effects were generally considered to be of low magnitude. For the later, most studies reported a 
combination of effects/no effects for different endpoints (e.g, confusion or hostility) or different 
vehicles (e.g., caffeine in water vs. caffeine in yogurt). The confidence in this evidence base is 
high. 
3.3.1.1.3 Depression in adults 
Depression or other related endpoints was measured in 10 controlled trials; in these studies, 
caffeine consumption at all doses tested (ranging from 80 to 1200 mg/day) had no negative 
impact on this endpoint. This conclusion is similar to that of Nawrot et al. (2003). Specifically, in 
seven of the clinical studies in which caffeine was administered acutely, caffeine had no effect 
on scores of depression (Bonnet and Arand, 2003a; Harrell and Juliano, 2009; James and Gregg, 
2004a; Marczinski et al., 2014; Sigmon et al., 2009; Yoto et al., 2012; Young and Benton, 2013). 
In the other three studies, acute administration of caffeine improved scores for this endpoint. For 
instance, Alsene et al. (2003) found that 150 mg caffeine decreased POMS scores measuring 
 MANUSCRIPT

63 
depression. Moreover, Keogh and Chaloner (2002) found that consumption of 250 mg caffeine 
(in coffee) significantly improved the depression/elation scores of women who had low anxiety-
sensitivity scores, although it had no effect on the scores of women who had medium or high 
sensitivity to anxiety. Lastly, following the ingestion of 208–270 mg caffeine, depression ratings 
were significantly lower after caffeine ingestion in older women but not younger women 
(Arciero and Ormsbee, 2009). 
There were also eight observational studies that evaluated the effect of caffeine on depression, 
mental health, or suicide risk, only one of which identified any increased risk. Shimbo et al. 
(2005) found that higher green tea consumption (assumed by the authors to contain 30 mg 
caffeine per 150-mL cup) was associated with a small but significant increased risk of “ill mental 
health” in females, but not males (OR for females, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01–1.56), at 100 mg caffeine. 
In contrast, four of the observational studies indicated a protective effect of caffeine at doses 
both above and below 400 mg/day. In a cross-sectional study of non-working adults, Smith 
(2009) found that all caffeine consumption was associated with a decreased risk of clinical 
depression, with the largest effect observed at levels greater than 260 mg/day (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 
0.1, 0.2). During 10 years of follow-up in a cohort of adult women who were free from 
depressive symptoms at baseline, no increased risk of clinical depression was observed in those 
with an average consumption of ≥550 mg caffeine/day compared to the lowest consumer group 
(<100 mg/day) (Lucas et al., 2011). In fact, Lucas et al. (2011) reported that depression risk 
decreased with increased caffeinated coffee consumption (≥550 mg/day compared to <100 
mg/day). Pham et al. (2014) found that caffeine consumption up to >291 mg/day was associated 
with a decreased risk of depressive symptoms (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.30–1.05) in an adult 
Japanese working population. Similar results were obtained when analyzing the effect of either

64 
coffee or green tea consumption individually. Ritchie et al. (2014) reported that consumption of 
≥3 cups of caffeine a day (≥300 mg caffeine) in elderly individuals had no significant effect on 
prevalent or incident depression in adults; however, a nonsignificant trend for lower depression 
was noted in women. Lastly, caffeine has also been reported as a potential protective factor 
against suicide. Lucas et al. (2014) found that caffeine intake of 300 mg/day was associated with 
a pooled multivariate RR for suicide of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63, 0.93). Similar results were obtained 
when analyzing increased coffee consumption, in which 2 cups of coffee per day resulted in a 
RR of suicide of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63–0.90) (Lucas et al., 2014). The remaining three 
observational studies found no effect of caffeine consumption (ranging from 83 to >781 mg/day) 
on the risk of depression (Ritchie et al., 2014; Ruusunen et al., 2010; Trapp et al., 2014).  
Taken together, the WoE suggests that the comparator of 400 mg/day of caffeine is acceptable 
intake which is not associated with significant concern regarding depression in adults. Of the 17 
studies evaluating such, only one study reported the potential for adverse effects (at an intake 
below the comparator) – findings were very low in magnitude. In contrast, four studies suggested 
that the comparator is too conservative, as studies reported a lack of effects at intakes up to 1200 
mg of caffeine (Bonnet and Arand, 2003a) (Figure 7C). In addition, several observational studies 
(Lucas et al., 2011, 2014; Pham et al., 2014; Smith, 2009) indicate that consumption of caffeine 
may be protective for moods and behavior related to this endpoint (i.e., beneficial effect). There 
is a moderate to high level of confidence in the underlying data, primarily driven by the 
consistency in findings and low risk of bias of the individual studies.

3.3.1.1.4 Mood (anxiety, anger and confusion, and depression) in children and adolescents 
Two controlled trials that studied mood in adolescents were identified (Figure 7D). In the first 
trial, Temple et al. (2009) found that 2.32 mg/kg caffeine/day did not significantly increase 
irritability in adolescents aged 12–17 years compared to the placebo group. The second trial used 
a double-blind, placebo controlled design to directly investigate the effects of caffeine and levels 
of circulating steroid hormones in males and females, in which participants (aged 15–16 years) 
were administered 2 mg/kg on two separate occasions (Temple and Ziegler, 2011). One hour 
after administration, mood states were assessed using the POMS questionnaire and compared to 
baseline. Following Bonferroni correction, no significant changes were observed for any of the 
measurements of anger, confusion, anxiety, or depression (Temple and Ziegler, 2011).  
Given the limited data, for all mood endpoints (anger, confusion, anxiety, depression) measured 
in children and adolescents, it was determined that there were insufficient data to develop refined 
conclusions regarding the potential effects of caffeine in populations other than healthy adults. 
However, the two studies discussed above indicated no effect of caffeine on mood parameters in 
adolescents. 
3.3.1.2 Headache  
3.3.1.2.1 Headache in adults 
Studies reviewed for this endpoint included both those that measured headache directly 
following administration, as well as those that looked at the effects of caffeine consumption over 
time so that the data include both “acute” effects and potential “withdrawal” effects of caffeine. 
Ratings of headaches (pain or severity), which are often captured via customized questionnaires

or a VAS, were not significantly increased in any of the 11 controlled trials that evaluated the 
effect of acute caffeine ingestion at doses ranging from 70 to 400 mg (Attwood et al., 2007; 
Haskell et al., 2008; Juliano et al., 2012; Liguori and Robinson, 2001; Pallarés et al., 2013; 
Rogers et al., 2008, 2010; Salinero et al., 2014; Sands et al., 2015; Stafford and Yeomans, 2005; 
Tinley et al., 2003). In two of these studies, in which caffeine was administered following a 
period of abstinence in regular consumers, caffeine significantly improved headache ratings 
(Juliano et al., 2012; Tinley et al., 2003) (see below for further discussion). Slightly higher doses 
of caffeine, however, may increase headache ratings, but only after some period. For example, 
Pallarés et al. (2013) studied adults participating in a weight-lifting protocol and assessed 
headache ratings the following day after administration of three different caffeine doses. 
Compared to a placebo, a slight increase in headache was seen with a 230-mg caffeine dose; 
higher single doses of approximately 459 mg and 689 mg caffeine/day increased the reports of 
headaches 24 hours later, although it should be noted that this study did not fully describe the 
statistical significance (Pallarés et al., 2013).  
Four observational studies (one cohort, one case-control, and two cross-sectional) that 
investigated the association between caffeine intake and headache were also identified. At the 
lower dose range of these studies, Rueda-Sanchez and Diaz-Martinez (2008) conducted a cross-
sectional survey and found no association between caffeine from daily coffee consumption and 
either episodic headache (NOEL of 129.2 mg/day) or chronic daily headache (CDH) (NOEL of 
158.7 mg/day). The remaining three studies support a potential association between headache 
and moderate to high caffeine consumption. In a case-control analysis of subjects with and 
without CDH, Scher et al. (2004) found that prior consumption (i.e., consumption over the past 
year prior to development of CDH) of 311 mg caffeine/day, primarily from coffee, was 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
67 
associated with CDH (OR, 1.50; P = 0.05), but that current high caffeine consumption was not 
significantly associated with such. The authors concluded that these results both supported the 
“biological model of caffeine withdrawal” with respect to caffeine’s relationship to headache yet 
indicated that this may not be true for all CDH sufferers (Scher et al., 2004). Furthermore, in a 
large-scale cross-sectional study of the effects of caffeine consumption and headaches in the 
general adult population, a significant increase in the prevalence of total headache (migraine plus 
nonmigrainous headache) was reported in the high-consumption group (>540 mg/day) compared 
to the low-consumption group (0–240 mg) (Hagen et al., 2009). When analyzing the prevalence 
of nonmigrainous headaches only, Hagen et al. (2009) reported a significant increase in 
headaches for those individuals consuming 241–400 mg caffeine/day compared to the group with 
a low consumption level. Headache frequency (either <7 days/month or 7–14 days/month) was 
also greater in the high-consumption group compared to the low-consumption group, although 
the authors cautioned that reverse causation may play a role (i.e., that some may consume 
caffeine for headache relief). In contrast, chronic headaches (i.e., >14 days/month) were not 
significantly associated with higher caffeine consumption (Hagen et al., 2009). Lastly, Ozsungur 
et al. (2009) included headache in one of three clusters describing caffeine withdrawal 
symptoms; the most sensitive of these was the “fatigue and headache,” factor, which was 
significantly increased in the 100–200 mg/day group (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.21–3.21).  
For adults, the WoE support that consumption of ≤400 mg caffeine is not associated with an 
increase in headaches (Figure 7E). However, like the evidence presented in Nawrot et al., (2003), 
observational studies do indicate a potential link between caffeine use and headache prevalence 
in some individuals, although some of this effect is likely due to withdrawal-related symptoms. 
In this regard, timing of the dose is important, since increases in reports of headache may only

68 
occur some significant time after ingestion (e.g., 12–24 hours for habitual users) (Cappelletti et 
al., 2015). Although these studies were relatively consistent among themselves, withdrawal-
related effects may be a factor in the outcomes of these observational studies, in addition to some 
residual confounding in these data due to reverse causation – factors making integration and 
interpretation of the findings quite complex. When effects were observed, the overall strength of 
association, however, was generally small (i.e., small magnitude). The confidence in the body of 
evidence is moderate to high. 
3.3.1.2.2 Headache in children and adolescents 
The effect of caffeine on headache in children and adolescents was assessed in two controlled 
trials, both of which suggest an effect of consumer status on this endpoint (Figure 7D). In the 
first study, Heatherley et al. (2006) found that 1.3 mg/kg caffeine administered to children (aged 
9–11 years) had no effect on headache ratings among those who were typically non- or low 
consumers (mean consumption of 12 mg/day); however, in regular consumers (mean 
consumption of 109 mg/day), caffeine reduced headache ratings compared to placebo. The 
authors suggest that these results indicate a reversal of the adverse effects, which may occur 
following overnight abstinence. In the second study, Temple et al. (2009) analyzed the effects of 
caffeine intake on irritability, hunger, and headaches in adolescents aged 12–17 years. Compared 
to the placebo group, changes in headache ratings did not reach statistical significance after 
consumption of 2.32 mg/kg caffeine/day; however, both male and female participants who were 
regular high-caffeine consumers (considered by the authors to be ≥50 mg/day) self-reported 
significantly more headaches than low consumers (Temple et al., 2009).

69 
One observational study was also identified that evaluated the relationship between caffeine 
consumption and headache in children. Kristjansson et al. (2014) reported on the physical 
complaints (e.g., headache, problems sleeping, and low appetite) that were associated with the 
daily intake of cola and energy drinks in Icelandic children (aged 10–12 years). Girls appeared to 
be more sensitive than boys to the caffeine-related headaches and <0.6 mg/kg caffeine/day (less 
than one cola drink day) was associated with an increase in headaches (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05–
1.41). For boys, significant increases in headaches were linked with consumption of more than 
one cola (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.62) and less than one energy drink (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 
1.42–2.46) per day (i.e., >0.6 mg/kg to <1.4 mg/kg caffeine/day).  
For children and adolescents, there was insufficient evidence to make conclusions regarding the 
appropriateness of the comparator. The limited evidence available, however, suggests that the 
comparator may be acceptable for headache; however, the data show that the relationship 
between headache and caffeine in children and adolescents is likely dependent on the timing of 
the dose and the subject’s typical consumption. 
3.3.1.3 Sleep 
For purposes of discussion, the effects of caffeine on sleep have been divided by population as 
well as into subjective and objective categories because the types of endpoints evaluated by each 
metric vary (i.e., different endpoints of sleep). The subjective effects are those that looked at 
perceptions of “sleepiness” mood states such as fatigue, tiredness, drowsiness, or weariness. 
These endpoints are often measured with POMS or VAS questionnaires shortly following 
caffeine administration. In addition to these endpoints, we also discuss objective measures of 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
70 
sleep, such as sleep latency, duration, and efficiency, which are quantified the night(s) following 
caffeine intake.  
3.3.1.3.1 Sleep in adults 
3.3.1.3.1.1 Subjective effects 
In total, there were 20 controlled trials that evaluated the subjective effect of caffeine on 
“sleepiness” mood states. Sixteen of these studies examined doses of caffeine ≤400 mg and 
found that caffeine either had no effect (Arciero and Ormsbee, 2009; Attwood et al., 2007; 
Harrell and Juliano, 2009; Liguori and Robinson, 2001; Sigmon et al., 2009; Sigmon and 
Griffiths, 2011; Tinley et al., 2003; Yoto et al., 2012) or may lead to improvements (i.e., 
decreases) in the ratings of sleepiness or fatigue (Alsene et al., 2003; Haskell et al., 2008; Juliano 
et al., 2012; Killen et al., 2013; Marczinski et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2013; Salinero et al., 2014; 
Stafford and Yeomans, 2005) when measured either immediately following consumption or the 
day afterward (Figure 7F). Furthermore, a single study with a slightly higher cumulative daily 
dose, approximately 420 mg caffeine (1.75 mg/kg body weight, three times daily), showed no 
effect on POMS ratings of fatigue (James and Gregg, 2004). In contrast to the aforementioned 
studies, there were just three controlled trials that found that caffeine intake was associated with 
increased ratings of “sleepiness.” One was a lower dose study, investigating the effect of caffeine 
in vehicle on mood. Like the effects on other mood endpoints discussed above, Young and 
Benton (2013) found that although 80 mg caffeine delivered with water led to a short-term boost 
in energetic feelings, tiredness ratings over the course of a proceeding test session were 
significantly increased (along with other adverse mood ratings) when caffeine was given with 
water alone, compared to the same amount of caffeine in yogurt or with glucose. The second 
 MANUSCRIPT

71 
study specifically associated fatigue with withdrawal side effects, stating that one of the defining 
elements of this state, the “fatigue and headache” factor, was significantly increased in the 100–
200 mg/day group (OR, 1.97; CI, 1.21, 3.21) (Ozsungur et al., 2009). The remaining clinical trial 
indicated that prolonged high-dose consumption may also negatively affect ratings of fatigue 
over time. Bonnet and Arand (2003) conducted a 7-day protocol in which adults who were 
moderate caffeine consumers were administered 1200 mg caffeine/day (400 mg, three times 
daily). After the week was complete, subjects reported significantly higher levels of fatigue than 
at baseline, likely due to a negative impact of caffeine on nighttime sleep observed throughout 
the study (Bonnet and Arand, 2003a). One observational study was also identified that examined 
the effect of caffeine on sleepiness. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
found that adult US service members who consumed ≥240 mg caffeine/day (three or more 
energy drinks) were more likely to experience daytime sleepiness than individuals who drank 
zero or one to two energy drinks per day (CDC, 2012).  
Based on the studies reviewed, the majority demonstrate that the comparator of 400 mg 
caffeine/day is acceptable as an intake generally not associated with concern regarding adverse 
effects on sleep. There were a few cases in which prolonged dosing was associated with 
increased fatigue; the magnitude of these changes was difficult to assess. Caffeine’s mode of 
action in the central nervous system (CNS) helps, in part, explain why most caffeine doses tested 
in these studies may indeed provide some benefit on this endpoint by reducing perceived fatigue; 
however, higher doses may disrupt sleep and lead to an increase in fatigue when consumed over 
the course of several days (see Bonnet and Arand, 2003a, and Section 3.3.1.3.1.2 on objective 
effects).

3.3.1.3.1.2 Objective effects 
Fifteen controlled studies evaluated objective aspects of sleep itself, often measured using 
polysomnography and/or actigraphy. Many of these were designed such that the dose of caffeine 
was administered within several hours prior to bedtime, sometimes with the deliberate intention 
of altering sleep (e.g., Keenan et al., 2014). As such, 11 of the 15 controlled trials using caffeine 
doses ≤400 mg reported that caffeine interfered with some aspect of sleep quality, including 
nocturnal activity, sleep efficiency (percentage of total time in bed spent in sleep), and sleep-
onset latency (Bonnet and Arand, 2003b; Carrier et al., 2007; Drake et al., 2006, 2013; Drapeau 
et al., 2006; Judice et al., 2013; Keenan et al., 2014; Omvik et al., 2007; Paterson et al., 2009, 
2007; Salinero et al., 2014). Only 1 of the 15 studies demonstrated no effect of a lower dose of 
caffeine on sleep when taken in the evening. Ho and Chung (2013) found that consumption of at 
least 1 cup of coffee (60–120 mg caffeine) within 6 hours of bed time had no significant effect 
on sleep latency, efficiency, or quality. Drake et al. (2006) reported that 240 mg caffeine/day 
administered to adults 1 hour prior to bedtime resulted in an increase in the “latency to persistent 
sleep” in individuals who were previously identified as being highly susceptible to sleep 
disturbance; however, no significant adverse effect on sleep was seen in individuals with a low 
susceptibility to sleep disturbance.  
The remaining three controlled studies investigated the effects of doses of caffeine >400 mg/day 
on objective measures of sleep and the results were split. After (on average) 6 hours following 
the administration of 480 mg caffeine to a sample of male athletes with low caffeine 
consumption, Pontifex et al. (2010) reported no change from baseline levels for sleep duration, 
wake time, number of awakenings, or sleep efficiency. Alternatively, Pallarés et al. (2013) found 
that a similar dose of caffeine (6 mg/kg or approximately 459 mg/day) administered prior to a 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
73 
weight-lifting protocol increased reports of sleep problems in subjects the following day, 
compared to placebo, although no effects were seen at the 230-mg/day dose. Furthermore, 
(Bonnet and Arand, 2003b) found that a cumulative dose of 1200 mg caffeine/day (400 mg, three 
times daily) given for 7 days can induce symptoms of insomnia, including reduced sleep quality 
and increased latency of sleep onset, in healthy subjects. The authors expected that adverse 
effects would occur, given the protocol and that the decrement in mood could be related to the 
sleep disruption caused by physiological arousal.  
Three observational studies were identified that provided inconsistent conclusions relative to the 
results from clinical studies above. Jaussent et al. (2011) found no observable effect on insomnia 
symptoms in male and female participants who self-reported a daily consumption of ≥190 mg 
caffeine/day. As described above, however, the CDC (2012) noted that adult US service 
members who consumed ≥240 mg caffeine/day (three or more energy drinks) experienced more 
sleep disruptions and were more likely to have reduced sleep than individuals who drank zero or 
one to two energy drinks per day. This study was conducted with soldiers who, due to the 
demands of a combat environment, had limited opportunity for sleep and may have purposely 
been using caffeine to remain awake and alert (IOM, 2001; McLellan et al., 2016). Interestingly, 
the observational study by the CDC (2012) indicated that sleep disruption may occur at much 
higher levels in habitual caffeine consumers. A cohort study of French workers found that 680 
mg caffeine/day was associated with a decreased sleep duration, but the investigators found no 
effect following consumption of 595 mg caffeine/day (Sanchez-Ortuno et al., 2005). 
With respect to the data obtained via objective measures of sleep in adults, results indicate that 
400 mg caffeine/day is likely too high as an intake, in that it would be expected to disrupt sleep 
when administered with the intention to do so. Specifically, ingestion of caffeine even at doses 
 MANUSCRIPT

74 
below the comparator can lead to delayed sleep onset and decreases in sleep quality and 
efficiency, but this is particularly the case when caffeine is consumed near bedtime. Overall, 
caffeine at doses both above and below the comparator may provide short-term benefits to 
improve perceived fatigue but, depending on the dose and timing, may also disrupt sleep, leading 
to increased fatigue the following day.  
3.3.1.3.2 Sleep in children and adolescents 
The adverse effects of caffeine on sleep in children and adolescents have been frequently 
investigated as associations between the two (see below for further discussion of association 
studies), yet we identified only one clinical study and two observational studies that contained 
quantitative data and were thus included (Figure 7D). Temple and Ziegler (2011) (described 
above) found no change in ratings of fatigue in adolescents following a dose of 2 mg/kg caffeine. 
As for the observational studies, Kristjansson et al. (2014)  (also described above) found that 
sleeping problems in boys (aged 10–12 years) were associated with caffeine intake as low as 
<0.6 mg/kg/day (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03–1.42), whereas girls (aged 10–12 years) seemed less 
sensitive to the sleep-disrupting effects that occurred between 0.6 mg/kg caffeine/day (OR, 1.55; 
95% CI, 1.21–1.98) and 1.4 mg/kg caffeine/day (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.07–2.25). In the other 
observational study, Calamaro et al. (2009) sought a link between total length of sleep on school 
nights and caffeine intake among adolescents aged 12–18 years. Those who slept 8–10 hours 
consumed a median of 54.1 mg caffeine/day, whereas those with the least sleep (3–5 hours) 
consumed a median of 157.6 mg/day (2.77 mg/kg) (Calamaro et al., 2009). Calamaro et al. 
(2009) noted the increased caffeine consumption, but it was not statistically significant (P = 
0.067). Like the other endpoints, there are insufficient data to evaluate with confidence the effect 
of caffeine dose on sleep in children and adolescent populations. However, based on the limited 
 MANUSCRIPT

75 
data, it appears that similar to adults, considerations such as timing and duration of dose are 
likely to be important for these populations as well. 
3.3.1.4 Problematic and risk-taking behavior in adults 
Endpoints in this category include substance abuse, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking, 
in addition to violent or disorderly behavior. Two studies, including one controlled trial and one 
observational study, were identified that addressed risk-taking behavior in (mostly young) adults, 
but there were no studies in younger populations (Figure 7G). Using a computer game that 
simulates risk taking (Balloon Analogue Risk Task), Peacock et al. (2013) found that 
consumption of one 250-mL energy drink (containing 80 mg caffeine) significantly increased 
risk-taking behavior in young adults, although the magnitude of effect was small. In the 
observational study, Krall et al. (2002) found that consumption of >6 cups of coffee per day 
(>570 mg caffeine) was a predictor of an increased risk of smoking relapse in a multivariable 
analysis of men who were former smokers. The available data for adults were considered to be 
too limited to make a refined conclusion relative to the comparators for this endpoint.  
3.3.2 Body of evidence assessment 
The initial confidence in the body of evidence (OHAT, 2015a) is moderate to high because most 
included studies involved measured and/or controlled exposures with adequate data presented on 
the endpoints of interest (Table 1). The low risk of bias scores (Figure 8) and low level of 
indirectness increase confidence in the overall body of evidence, although this is much more so 
the case for the data on adults than for children and adolescents. Of the 81 studies reviewed and 
graded for the SR, 96% (78 of 81) were associated with a definitely or probably low risk of bias. 
The magnitudes of effects, when apparent, were typically small except for those related to the 
 MANUSCRIPT

76 
impact of caffeine on sleep, which could be larger. Across the body of evidence, most of the 
endpoints were consistent in observations, apart from anxiety, which was associated with both 
effects and a lack of effects below the comparator (a trend that was in line with previous 
literature, according to many of the original study authors). Only 12 of the included studies 
evaluated dose response (half of which showed evidence of a gradient effect on the endpoint), 
whereas most studies were controlled trial designs that administered only a single dose, thus 
limiting the ability to evaluate dose-response relationships. 
Overall, the Nawrot et al. (2003) conclusions for the safe levels of daily caffeine intake for 
healthy adults are generally supported by this body of evidence. There are sufficient data from 
RCTs that lower doses of caffeine may negatively affect some aspects of behavior (particularly 
anxiety) and sleep for adults; however, these changes are often low in magnitude and/or are more 
apparent in sensitive subpopulations.  
As Nawrot et al. (2003) predicted, more evidence has become available addressing how 
individual differences (namely, polymorphisms of the ADORA2A receptor and their relationship 
to anxiety) may explain some interindividual variability in sensitivity to caffeine’s effects. 
Furthermore, caffeine’s ability to disrupt objective measures of sleep when administered later in 
the evening, or shortly before bedtime, may not reflect common consumer behavior or is often 
self-limiting (Nawrot et al., 2003; Penolazzi et al., 2012). Otherwise, there was little to no 
evidence identified to suggest that <400 mg caffeine/day has any negative effects on mood 
states, outside of effects on anxiety in sensitive subpopulations. In contrast, caffeine 
consumption appears to provide some benefit with regard to fatigue- and depression-related 
endpoints.

The body of evidence is inconsistent with regard to the effect of caffeine consumption below the 
comparator and its effect on headache. Some of the mixed results may be linked to symptoms of 
withdrawal and consumer status. The confidence in this body of evidence for this endpoint is 
moderately high, because most of the data are from RCTs that directly assessed the relationship 
between caffeine and headache (Table 1) and all studies but one were associated with a low risk 
of bias (Figure 8). This factors in some inconsistency in the dataset, driven by the difference in 
results between the observational studies and the RCTs.  
Lastly, there is sparse evidence that caffeine is associated with an increase in risk-taking 
behavior in adults. This latter effect is a research area that has seemingly attracted more attention 
since the work by Nawrot et al. (2003) was published, particularly for younger consumers (see 
below). 
For adolescents and children, Nawrot et al. (2003)  concluded “…it is unknown if long-term 
daily consumption of caffeine would produce effects similar to those observed in the studies 
reviewed above. However, it is known that the human nervous system (including the brain) 
continues to develop and mature throughout childhood. It is possible that the protracted 
development of the nervous system may render children more sensitive to any adverse effects of 
caffeine.” The available literature for children and adolescents included in this SR was scant, but 
the higher-quality studies suggest no major adverse effects on the observed endpoints at doses 
near or less than 2.5 mg/kg. Overall, the body of literature reviewed for children and adolescents 
was generally of lower quality compared to the data for adults, due to issues of study design, 
indirectness, and potential for reverse causation (Table 1). For children and adolescent 
populations, there was not enough information, high quality or otherwise, to fully evaluate the 
appropriateness of the comparator. More targeted research is required to identify sensitive

78 
subpopulations in these younger groups, to better quantify the levels at which adverse behavioral 
effects are observed as well as to better understand the link between caffeine consumption and 
adverse effects (e.g., sleep and risk-taking behavior). 
The SR of 81 studies provided evidence to evaluate potential impacts of the consumption of 400 
mg caffeine/day on the behavior outcome, including assessment of mood (comprising anxiety 
and other mood states), headache, sleep, withdrawal, and risk-taking behavior. When the weight 
of evidence was considered, the comparator, 400 mg caffeine/day, was found to be an acceptable 
intake that is not be associated with significant concern for adverse behavioral effects in adults.  
However, intake below the comparator may affect some sensitive individuals who are prone to 
anxiety or sleep disruption. Often, observed effects below the comparator (e.g., anxiety) were 
limited to subgroups or timing of dose (e.g., sleep), whereas others were complicated by 
consumer status (e.g., headache and fatigue).  For some endpoints (depression, headache, sleep 
[subjective], and anger/confusion there was largely a lack of effects reported, and in some cases, 
data suggested that intakes higher than the comparator were without effect. There is a moderate 
to high level of confidence in the body of evidence supporting this conclusion. Confidence was 
increased by the overall low risk of bias and low level of indirectness; although the variability 
introduced by sensitive subpopulations and consumer status were key limitations that precluded a 
higher level of confidence. 
Of the 81 included studies, the data in children and adolescents were limited to just 5 studies, 
which together evaluated mood, headache, and sleep. As such, it was determined that the 
evidence base was insufficient to render a conclusion regarding appropriateness of the 
comparator (2.5 mg caffeine/day) for potential impacts of caffeine consumption on behavior 
outcomes in these populations.

3.4 Reproduction and development 
We reviewed 94 full text papers evaluating reproductive and developmental effects (Figure 2). A 
total of 58 these studies were considered to meet the criteria for inclusion in the SR as they 
permitted comparison to Nawrot et al. (2003) conclusions. Of the 36 studies that were excluded, 
26 studies contained information regarding potential associations between caffeine consumption 
and reproductive or developmental endpoints. With respect to the PECO, all of the studies 
included involved adult populations. The majority of studies involved exposures in pregnant 
women, for which the Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator of <300 mg/day was applied. For the few 
studies evaluating nonpregnant women (e.g., studies evaluating fecundity or age at menopause) 
or men (e.g., studies evaluating sperm quality), the Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator of <400 
mg/day for a healthy adult was applied.  
Only 3 of the 58 included studies were randomized clinical trials; the remaining 55 were 
observational studies, primarily cohort and case-control studies. Exposures in the observational 
studies were characterized using self-reported methods (e.g., food frequency questionnaires) in 
all of the clinical studies but one and were based on consumption of coffee, soda, and tea in most 
studies. Chocolate was also included in a number of studies, whereas caffeine-containing 
medications and energy drinks were evaluated only in a few. Most studies evaluated the amount 
of caffeine in these substances as part of the analysis; in the few studies that did not, the amount 
of caffeine was calculated by the SR authors per the methods (Section 2).  
Many of these studies were conducted in participants from large cohorts such as the Danish 
National Birth Cohort (Bech et al., 2005, 2006, 2015) and the National Birth Defects Prevention 
Study (Browne et al., 2007, 2011; Chen et al., 2012; Collier et al., 2009; Hoyt et al., 2014;

80 
Kancherla et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2009, 2010). Common variables 
accounted for in such analyses included maternal characteristics such as race, age, weight, BMI, 
smoking (some using cotinine as a marker), and alcohol consumption. Other factors more 
specific to endpoints of concern were also considered, such as history of previous pregnancy or 
miscarriage, partner characteristics, family history of condition, gestational age at birth, and 
maternal nutrient and supplement intake. Some studies included changes in caffeine consumption 
during pregnancy as a variable, although most studies did not. However, nausea was evaluated as 
a confounder in most studies included in the SR that investigated fetal/neonatal demise 
(spontaneous abortion, recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth), although the extent to which information 
was collected and incorporated varied. Controlling for symptoms of the so-called “pregnancy 
signal,” such as nausea, aversion to smells or tastes, and vomiting, has been considered critical 
for robustly assessing these endpoints, since these correlates of pregnancy health status may also 
influence caffeine intake (Lawson et al., 2004; Stein and Susser, 1991). Without specific 
analyses of caffeine aversion, it is difficult to ascertain whether an increased incidence of 
spontaneous abortion in a study is due to higher caffeine consumption, or if reduced caffeine 
consumption is being observed in healthier pregnancies due to the pregnancy signal (i.e., reverse 
causation).  
With respect to the comparator of <300 or <400 mg/day from Nawrot et al. (2003), the majority 
of the data points, regardless of findings, were below these levels (Figure 9). The majority of 
analyses were conducted using categorical exposure groupings (e.g., <1 cup/day, 1–3 cups/day, 
and >3 cups/day); such data were standardized either as part of the authors’ analysis or, in a few 
cases, per the SR methods. About half of the studies evaluated 300 mg/day (or just above) as the 
highest intake level, whereas <10% evaluated upper intake levels below the 300 mg/day 
 MANUSCRIPT

81 
comparator. The remaining third of the included studies evaluated intake levels higher than 300 
mg/day, with the highest evaluated in a single study was >1000 mg/day. Most studies were 
designed specifically to evaluate caffeine (typically via conversion of self-reported consumption 
of cups of a caffeine-containing substance per day) and thus were considered to have a low level 
of indirectness.  
Endpoints characterizing the reproductive and developmental toxicity outcome included 
fecundability and infertility, spontaneous abortion, recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth (including late 
spontaneous abortion), preterm birth, fetal growth (including small for gestational age 
[SGA]/intrauterine growth restriction [IUGR]), birth defects, childhood behavior, childhood 
cancer, markers of maternal stress, pregnancy-induced hypertension and/or preeclampsia, and 
age at menopause (Figure 9; Table 1). The endpoints with the largest number of studies (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion, fetal growth) were also in Nawrot et al. (2003). However, some of the 
endpoints reviewed herein, such as childhood cancers or childhood behavior associated with 
prenatal caffeine exposure, were not reviewed by Nawrot et al. (2003). Conversely, this effort 
did not identify studies evaluating the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.  
3.4.1 Summary of individual studies by endpoint 
Data for two general endpoints, fecundability and reproductive measures (male and female), 
were evaluated in healthy adults using the Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator of 400 mg/kg (Figure 
9A). The remaining endpoints within this outcome were associated with caffeine exposures in 
pregnant women and thus were evaluated relative to the Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator of 300 
mg/day (Figure 9, B and C).

3.4.1.1 Fecundability, fertility, and male reproductive measures 
Fecundability (the ability to conceive during a given menstrual cycle) was evaluated in two 
studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in the SR; in these studies, no association between 
increased time to pregnancy and female caffeine intakes at levels of ≥300 mg/day was found 
(Hatch et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2011). Related to fertility, one study reported a lack of effects 
for ovulatory disorder infertility at caffeine consumption of ≥333 mg/day (Chavarro et al., 2009).  
Four studies were included that evaluated male reproductive parameters. Two of these studies 
reported a lack of effects at levels above the 400 mg/day comparator. Jensen et al. (2010) 
reported a lack of effects observed on reduced sperm concentration or total sperm count at intake 
levels of >570 mg/day. Sobreiro et al. (2005) reported a lack of effects on semen quality (as 
measured by semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, and percent motile sperm 
and morphologically normal forms) following consumption of >800 mg/day. With regard to the 
other two studies that evaluated exposures below the 400 mg/day comparator, Paton et al. (2010) 
reported no effects on salivary testosterone following up to 240 mg caffeine via chewing gum 
during repeated sprint athletic performance. Schmid et al. (2007) reported that men consuming 
>308 mg/day had significantly higher (~20%) frequencies of sperm with DNA damage, as 
measured under neutral, but not alkaline, conditions compared to men with less caffeine 
consumption.  
Taken together, there is a moderate to high level of confidence that the comparator of 400 
mg/day in healthy adults is acceptable for fertility, fecundability, and male reproductive 
endpoints (Table 2). Confidence is increased by the consistency of findings (lack of effects 
above and below the comparator), low risk of bias, and low level of indirectness.

3.4.1.2 Spontaneous abortion 
Spontaneous abortion during early pregnancy was evaluated in eight observational studies 
reviewed in this SR; the gestational ages included in the studies varied but generally were 
included in the first trimester and up to 20 weeks gestation. In four of these studies, no increased 
risk of spontaneous abortion was identified at maternal caffeine intake levels at or below the 
comparator of 300 mg/day (Giannelli et al., 2003; Karypidis et al., 2006; Maconochie et al., 
2007; Rasche, 2003). One of these studies (Maconochie et al., 2007) further noted that no effects 
were observed at levels of >500 mg/day (Figure 9B). In a fifth study, maternal caffeine 
consumption was found to not be associated with risk of miscarriage when intakes among 
caffeine consumers were compared above the 75th percentiles of >463.1 mg/day (approximately 
4 weeks gestation) and >273.2 mg/day (approximately 16 weeks gestation) versus nonusers 
(Savitz et al., 2008). In two case-control studies, daily maternal caffeine consumption above the 
comparator (>300 and ≥375 mg/day) was found to be significantly associated with risk of 
spontaneous abortion (Giannelli et al., 2003; Rasche, 2003). Of note, these studies attempted to 
account for the pregnancy signal. Of the eight studies evaluating spontaneous abortion, all but 
Rash (2003) and Wen et al. (2001) controlled for nausea and/or vomiting.  
A significant association was observed between maternal caffeine intake at levels >500 mg/day 
during early pregnancy and spontaneous abortion in women with the CYP1B1 432 Val/Val 
genotype (Karypidis et al., 2006). These effects were not seen in women with the Leu/Leu or 
Leu/Val genotypes, and analysis of all genotypes combined was not performed.  
Two prospective studies reviewed in the SR reported that maternal caffeine consumption during 
the first trimester increased the risk for spontaneous abortion for intakes below the comparator 
 MANUSCRIPT

84 
(Wen et al., 2001; Weng et al., 2008). In the study by Wen et al. (2001), consumption of 100–
299 mg/day was found to be associated with an increased risk (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0–4.1) 
compared to <20 mg/day; however, for mothers reporting nausea, an association was found only 
after nausea had started and only at levels ≥300 mg/day (RR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.0–14.6). Weng et al. 
(2008) found a significant association at intakes ≥200 mg/day, the highest consumption category 
evaluated (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.34, 3.69), compared to women with no caffeine intake. 
However, when analysis was restricted to women who reduced caffeine intake during pregnancy, 
this association was no longer significant (≥200 mg/day; HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.87–2.51). In a 
separate study, Signorello et al. (2001) did not conduct an analysis on the study population 
overall, but rather only analyzed data stratified by indices of caffeine metabolism. Mean daily 
caffeine intake was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of spontaneous 
abortion in pregnant women with CYP1A2 activity above the median (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.01, 
5.80). Conversely, pregnant women with CYP1A2 activity below the mean had reduced risk, 
with ORs of 0.32 and 0.46 for these same caffeine intake levels (100–299 mg/day). Slow 
acetylators had a significant increase in risk of spontaneous abortion at intakes of 100–299 
mg/day (OR, 2.38; CI, 1.04–5.49); this effect was not observed at the higher dose level (OR, 
1.65; CI, 0.67–4.06).  
Considering the totality of the evidence, there is a moderate level of confidence in the body of 
evidence that the comparator of 300 mg/day is acceptable as an intake that would not be 
associated with significant concern of spontaneous abortion. Several studies documented effects 
at lower levels of consumption; thus, some data indicate that the comparator may be too high for 
certain subpopulations/phenotypes, although other studies reported lack of effect following 
consumption >500 mg/day. Confidence in the overall body of evidence on spontaneous abortion 
 MANUSCRIPT

85 
is significantly limited by the inability to fully accommodate for the pregnancy signal. 
Confidence is also decreased by the lack of consistency in the direction of findings both above 
and below the comparator. An overall low risk of bias (Figure 10) and a low level of indirectness 
increase the overall confidence of the studies included on spontaneous abortion. Consideration of 
the magnitude of effect neither strengthened nor lessened confidence in the body of evidence 
given that in the two studies reporting effects below the comparator, the magnitude was low (OR 
or RR between 2.0 and 2.4), and for one study effects were only found in subgroups. The overall 
level of confidence in the body of evidence which supports the conclusion remained moderate, 
primarily due to the strong potential confounding effects of the pregnancy signal and 
inconsistency of findings. 
3.4.1.3 Recurrent miscarriage 
Four case-control studies that evaluated recurrent miscarriage (defined as at least two or more 
pregnancy losses) were included in the SR. Three of these studies reported that maternal caffeine 
consumption was not associated with overall incidence of recurrent miscarriage at intake levels 
at or below the comparator of 300 mg/day (George et al., 2006; Sata et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 
2010) (Figure 9B). Although no significant findings were observed overall, some effects were 
noted in subgroup analyses from these three studies. For example, Sata et al. (2005) noted that, 
while no association was found in subjects with other genotypes of CYP1A2 studied at levels 
≥300 mg/day, women who were homozygous for CYP1A2*1F were at higher risk (OR, 5.23; 
95% CI, 1.05–25.9). In the fourth study, Stefanidou et al. (2011) reported that maternal 
consumption of 151–300.9 mg/day was associated with recurrent miscarriage based on an 
unadjusted analysis (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.28–7.29). Adjusted analyses evaluated caffeine intake 
as a continuous measure rather than within consumption categories and indicated that the odds of 
 MANUSCRIPT

86 
unexplained recurrent miscarriage were 2.72 (95% CI 2.72-2.73, rounded) times greater for cases 
compared to controls for each 100 mg/day of caffeine consumed. However, the reporting of 
caffeine consumption late after miscarriage greatly increased the potential for recall bias, and the 
analyses were not adjusted for the pregnancy signal (which was evaluated as presence of 
nausea/vomiting by the authors but not controlled in these analyses).  
The evidence from these four studies provides a moderate level of confidence that ≤300 mg/day 
is an acceptable intake that would not be associated with significant concerns for endpoints 
related to recurrent miscarriage in healthy pregnant women. Confidence is increased by the 
overall low level of indirectness (Table 1), low risk of bias (Figure 10), and reasonable 
consistency in the lack of findings. 
3.4.1.4 Stillbirth 
Four studies included in the SR evaluated stillbirth, which in some cases combined stillbirth  
with late spontaneous abortion. No effects were reported in these studies below the 300 mg/day 
comparator; however, two studies reported increased risk at ≥300 mg/day (Figure 9B). In a large 
study of prospective data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, no increased risk of fetal death 
(stillbirth and late spontaneous abortion combined) or stillbirth was found with maternal caffeine 
intake levels equivalent to the comparator (Bech et al., 2005). Above the comparator, an effect 
was observed at 400–700 mg/day based on analysis of fetal death (all deaths after 20 weeks 
gestation) (Bech et al., 2005). When stillbirth (all causes) was analyzed separately in this same 
study, no effects were observed following consumption of ≥380 mg/day. When stillbirths were 
further analyzed by attributed cause, only stillbirth due to placental dysfunction was significantly 
associated with consumption ≥380 mg/day (Bech et al., 2005). A nested case-control study of 
 MANUSCRIPT

87 
this same cohort reported similar findings, with no effects for stillbirth following consumption of 
≥380 mg/day (Bech et al., 2006). Mean caffeine intake up to 299 mg/day throughout pregnancy 
was not significantly associated with fetal death (>20 weeks gestation) in a case-control study of 
a Uruguayan population; intake of ≥300 mg/day showed a statistically significant increased risk 
(OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.23, 4.41) (Matijasevich et al., 2006). Greenwood et al. (2010) reported that 
maternal caffeine intake during the first trimester was significantly associated with increased 
stillbirth and late miscarriage (defined as loss between 12 and 24 weeks) at ≥300 mg/day; the 
adjusted OR was 5.1 (95% CI, 1.6–16.4). The wide CIs are likely attributed to the small number 
of events in this study (28 fetal deaths out of a population of 2635); this is in contrast to the 
larger study by Bech et al. (2005) (no increased risk of fetal death below the comparator), which 
consisted of 1102 fetal deaths and a total population of 88,842.  
These four studies provide a moderate level of confidence to support a conclusion that 
comparator of ≤300 mg/day is an acceptable intake that would not be associated with significant 
concern for endpoints related to stillbirth in healthy pregnant women. The overall low risk of 
bias and high level of indirectness increase the overall confidence in the evidence base. When 
effects were observed (intakes of 300mg/day or more), the magnitude of ranged from <2 to >5 
(Table 1).  
 
3.4.1.5 Preterm birth and gestational age 
Effects on preterm birth and gestational age were considered together for the purposes of this 
SR; five studies were identified to characterize this endpoint (Figure 9B). No association 
between preterm birth and maternal caffeine consumption at or above the comparator was found 
 MANUSCRIPT

88 
in the four observational studies included (Bakker et al., 2010; Bracken et al., 2003; Clausson et 
al., 2002; Maslova et al., 2010). Bakker et al. (2010) and Clausson et al. (2002) evaluated higher 
intake levels, and no effects were observed following a maternal caffeine intake ≥540 and >500 
mg/day in these studies, respectively. One of these studies was a meta-analysis that evaluated 
case-control (n = 7) and cohort (n = 15) studies with coffee, tea, cocoa/chocolate, and cola or 
soda drinks as the sources of caffeine exposure (Maslova et al., 2010). The fifth study was a 
randomized double-blind controlled trial (Bech et al., 2007). In this study, pregnant women 
already consuming at least 3 cups of coffee per day were assigned to drink caffeinated or 
decaffeinated coffee during the second half of pregnancy, but they were permitted to drink as 
much caffeine from coffee as well as other sources as desired. No differences in gestation length 
(95% CI, −2.87 to 0.25; P = 0.48) were reported between the two groups (where median daily 
caffeine intake for the two groups was 117 versus 317 mg/day).  
Overall, there is a moderate to high level of confidence (Table 1) that the comparator of 300 
mg/day is an acceptable intake level that would not be associated with significant concern for 
preterm birth and gestational age in healthy pregnant women (Table 2), because the data 
consistently showed a lack of effects both above and below the comparator. Several studies 
present findings that suggest the comparator is too low.  
3.4.1.6 Fetal growth 
Of the 14 studies evaluating fetal growth, nine of the included studies reported no effects of 
maternal caffeine consumption up to the comparator of 300 mg/day for the following endpoints: 
birthweight (Bakker et al., 2010; Balat et al., 2003; Bech et al., 2007; Bracken et al., 2003; 
Clausson et al., 2002), SGA (Bakker et al., 2010; Bech et al., 2015; Hoyt et al., 2014; Infante-

Rivard, 2007), IUGR (Bracken et al., 2003; Grosso et al., 2001), and placenta weight, placenta 
diameter, newborn length, or head circumference (Balat et al., 2003) (Figure 9C).  
Two of the studies, including one of the Danish National Birth Cohort, revealed an increased risk 
for SGA at consumption levels above the comparator. Hoyt et al. (2014) reported effects at 
consumption levels ≥300 mg/day, and Bech et al. (2015) reported effects at 25–300 mg/day for 
decreased birth weight, although associations with increased risk of SGA were only observed in 
the group that consumed >325 mg/day. One study reported that newborn weight was 
significantly lower in mothers who consumed >300 mg caffeine/day compared to those 
consuming <300 mg/day (P < 0.05); no details on the method and frequency of intake recall 
were provided (Balat et al., 2003). In addition, the only analysis performed was a chi-square test, 
as such no adjustment for confounders was performed. Although a significant effect on mean 
birth weight (−28 g/100 mg caffeine) was noted in the study by Bracken et al. (2003), the authors 
concluded that is was not clinically important below intakes of 600 mg/day. Similarly, Bakker et 
al. (2010) reported a significant association with low birthweight at maternal intake levels ≥540 
mg/day. In the randomized double-blind controlled trial described above by Bech et al. (2007), 
no differences in infant birth weight (95% CI, −40 to 73; P = 0.57) were reported between the 
two groups (117 versus 317 mg/day median intake). One study reported that placenta weight was 
significantly lower in mothers who consumed >300 mg caffeine/day compared to those 
consuming <300 mg/day (P < 0.05), whereas no significant association was found between 
caffeine intake and newborn length, head circumference, or placental diameter (Balat et al., 
2003).  
Four of the 14 included studies reported associations between prenatal caffeine exposure and 
adverse effects on fetal growth at maternal intake levels lower than the comparator (Figure 9C).

Maternal caffeine consumption was associated with SGA offspring in a large prospective cohort 
study by Sengpiel et al. (2013); the LOEL in this study was identified as 51–200 mg/day, 
regardless of the definition used for SGA. In a case-control study, caffeine intake in the second 
and third trimesters was associated with increased risk of SGA; this was demonstrated in 
adjusted analyses in which high versus low consumption (<223 mg/day versus >223 mg/day) had 
an OR of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0, 2.4) (Vik et al., 2003). Analysis by quartiles of caffeine intake was 
not adjusted for potential confounders but identified an increased risk starting at 110–204.9 
mg/day (OR, 1.9; CI, 1.0, 3.7), with a P for trend of 0.001 (Vik et al., 2003). In a large 
prospective cohort study, maternal caffeine consumption of 200–299 mg/day during pregnancy 
was associated with an increased risk of IUGR (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.1); a significant trend 
was also noted across all trimesters (CARE Study Group, 2008). An association was also 
observed in a regression analysis for birth weight, with >200 mg/day associated with a reduction 
in birth weight of about 60–70 g (P = 0.004). Finally, as mentioned above, Bech et al. (2015) 
reported effects at 25–300 mg/day for decreased birth weight, although this effect is not thought 
to be clinically significant because associations with increased risk of SGA were only observed 
at levels >325 mg/day. However, a meta-analysis evaluating 13 prospective studies concluded 
that there was “no clear threshold level of intake below which caffeine does not affect birth 
weight” (Chen et al., 2014). In this analyses, low birth weight/SGA/IUGR (combined in 
analysis) was found to be associated with 50–149 mg/day maternal caffeine intake based on RRs 
of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.06–1.21) for low caffeine intake (50–149 mg/day), 1.38 (95% CI, 1.18–1.62) 
for moderate caffeine intake (150–349 mg/day), and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.24–2.08) for high caffeine 
intake (≥350 mg/day), as compared with no or very low caffeine intake.

The final study included for review was one designed to investigate the relationship between 
maternal caffeine consumption and risk of high birth weight babies. In this large prospective 
cohort study, higher levels of caffeine intake were demonstrated not to be associated with 
increased risk of delivering a high birth weight baby (>4000 g; Ørskou et al., 2003). The adjusted 
OR for pregnant women with caffeine intakes ≥400 mg/day was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79, 0.95), 
whereas it was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81, 0.96) for pregnant women with caffeine intakes of 200–399 
mg/day. Although the authors concluded that caffeine intakes ≥400 mg/day were associated with 
a reduced risk of giving birth to a high birth weight baby, they also noted that there was a 
significantly increased risk for delivery of a baby weighing >4000 g in the reference group (<200 
mg/day).  
The body of evidence for fetal growth was difficult to integrate based on the inconsistent 
findings, and thus difficult to determine a refined conclusion; all of comparison points below the 
comparator indicated observed effects (suggesting the comparator is too high), whereas the 
majority of comparison points equal to or greater than the comparator reported a lack of effects 
(suggesting the comparator was acceptable or too low). The biological significance of the birth 
weight changes are more robustly evaluated in studies evaluating SGA or IUGR, which as a 
whole, did not provide support for effects below the comparator. A low magnitude of effect 
(between 1 and 2 for studies below the comparator) —as well as the observation that, in many 
cases, effects were limited to single measures and/or subgroups or were not clinically relevant 
changes—reduced overall confidence in the data suggesting that the comparator may be too high. 
Across all studies, only five controlled for nausea and/or vomiting. Confidence in the underlying 
body of evidence supporting the conclusion is increased, however, when the low risk of bias 
(Figure 10) was considered.

3.4.1.7 Birth defects 
A total of 11 studies that evaluated birth defects and caffeine consumption were included in the 
SR (Figure 9C). The following birth defects were evaluated and reported not to be associated 
with maternal caffeine consumption at or above the comparator of 300 mg/day in any of the 
studies included in the SR: cardiovascular malformations (CVMs; overall nor in any of the CVM 
subgroups studied) (Browne et al., 2007), choanal atresia (Kancherla et al., 2014), cleft lip (with 
or without cleft palate) or cleft palate only (Collier et al., 2009; Johansen et al., 2009), persistent 
cryptorchidism (Mongraw-Chaffin et al., 2008), and various other individual birth defects, 
including anotia/microtia, esophageal atresia, diaphragmatic hernia, omphalocele, or 
gastroschisis (Browne et al., 2011). In the study by Browne et al. (2011), high dietary caffeine 
consumption (≥300 mg/day) and craniosynostosis were associated (OR, 1.34; CI, 1.01–1.77) but 
no dose response was observed. These same authors reported statistically significant associations 
between both small intestinal atresia and total caffeine intake of 10 to <100 mg/day (OR, 1.54; 
95% CI, 1.02–2.33) and 200 to <300 mg/day (OR, 1.79; CI, 1.09–2.93)  but not at other intake 
levels. It is important to note that no dose response was seen for any birth defects evaluated in 
this study; thus, convincing evidence of an etiologic relationship was not supported. An 
increased risk of persistent cryptorchidism (present at birth and age 2 years) in male children was 
only found to be associated with maternal first-trimester caffeine consumption of 405 mg 
caffeine/day (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.06, 1.93) (Mongraw-Chaffin et al., 2008); of note, this intake 
level was described as an interquartile range, but no information on other consumption levels 
was provided.

Two of the 11 studies included in the SR reported statistically significant effect ranges below the 
comparator (Chen et al., 2012; De Marco et al., 2011;) and one reported borderline statistical 
significance for a LOEL (Miller et al. 2009). In a large case-control study, a weak but marginally 
statistically significant association was observed between maternal caffeine intake and anorectal 
atresia in offspring; the ORs for 10–99 mg/day, 100–299 mg/day, and ≥300 mg/day were 1.4 
(CI, 1.0, 1.9), 1.3 (CI, 1.0, 1.8), and 1.5 (CI, 1.0, 2.2), respectively, when compared to <10 
mg/day (Miller et al., 2009). However, even though a LOEL of 10–99 mg/day was identified, no 
dose response is visible and the CIs at all intake levels start at unity. In a second study on the 
same case-control population, Chen et al. (2012) concluded there to be a “weak” or “moderate” 
increased risk of limb defects (LDs) and maternal caffeine intake. No effects were observed for 
isolated longitudinal or longitudinal preaxial LDs, and all subgroups for multiple congenital 
anomalies with LD at intakes of ≥300 mg/day. Intake levels associated with no effects on all 
isolated LDs or transverse LDs were both 10 to <100 mg/day. The LOEL was determined to be 
the lowest significant effect level based on the authors’ conclusions, despite the similar response 
across all dose groups and lack of dose response.  
Finally, neural tube defects (NTDs) were evaluated in three different case-control studies 
included in the SR, and the results conflicted. In the first study, maternal coffee intake in the 
periconceptional period was associated with an increased risk of NTDs in offspring; caffeine 
intake >285 mg/day had an adjusted OR of 10.82 (95% CI, 3.78–31) (De Marco et al., 2011). In 
the second study, although the authors concluded that maternal caffeine consumption (coffee, 
tea, soda, chocolate) was associated with all NTDs (adjusted OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0, 1.6) and 
spina bifida (OR, 1.4; CI, 1.1, 1.9), these data are based on a none (0–9 mg/day) versus all (≥10 
mg/day) analysis (Schmidt et al., 2009). When analyzed by quartiles, there was no evidence of a 
 MANUSCRIPT

94 
trend and there were no significant findings at higher intake levels of ≥300 mg/day for NTDs 
(OR, 1.2; CI, 0.8–1.6), spina bifida (OR, 1.4; CI, 0.9–2.1), encephalocele (OR, 0.8; CI, 0.5–1.5), 
and anencephaly (OR, 1.4; CI, 0.6–3.3). In the third case-control study, maternal caffeine 
consumption of ≥190 mg caffeine/day was not associated with risk of spina bifida in offspring at 
the highest intake evaluated (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3, 1.2) (Benedum et al., 2013).  
Although the evidence base is broad with respect to the type of birth defects and underlying 
etiologies, data were relatively consistent in demonstrating a lack of effects following 
consumption of caffeine at intakes up to 300 mg/day in healthy pregnant women. Based on the 
underlying study types (observational), low risk of bias, and consistency in findings, there was a 
moderate level of confidence in this conclusion.  
3.4.1.8 Childhood cancers 
Three studies that evaluated childhood cancers as related to maternal exposure to caffeine were 
reviewed and included in the SR: there was one study on CNS tumors and there were two studies 
on childhood leukemia (Bonaventure et al., 2013; Menegaux et al., 2007; Plichart et al., 2008). 
Neither maternal coffee consumption nor tea consumption alone was associated with combined 
childhood malignant CNS tumors in the Epidemiological Study on Childhood Cancer and 
Leukemia (ESCALE) study, a national population-based case-control study (Plichart et al., 
2008). However, total caffeine intake (coffee plus tea) of >332.2 mg/day was significantly 
associated with all CNS tumors (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5, 13) (Plichart et al., 2008). When assessed 
by tumor type, only ependymomas were observed to be associated with caffeine: >47.2 mg 
caffeine/day yielded an OR of 2.5 (CI, 1.1, 5.9). Coffee plus tea (>332.2 mg/day) was also 
significantly associated with ependymomas but the sample size was small (n = 3; OR, 23.1; CI, 
 MANUSCRIPT

95 
4.4–120); no association was seen with coffee alone. In a French population-based case-control 
study, maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy (coffee only) of >285 mg/day was not 
significantly associated with an increased risk of childhood acute leukemia, acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia, or acute myeloblastic leukemia (Menegaux et al., 2007). The authors note as an 
additional key finding that maternal coffee of >3 cups/day during pregnancy was related to acute 
leukemia (AL) in children whose mothers were nonsmokers; however, the data are incompletely 
presented. Conversely to the primary findings from Menegaux et al. (2007), Bonaventure et al. 
(2013) report that maternal coffee intake during pregnancy (timing of retrospective collection not 
provided) was associated with increased risk of childhood acute leukemia in a case-control study. 
Acute leukemia was found to be associated with consumption of 95–190 mg caffeine/day (OR, 
1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7), whereas acute myeloblastic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
effects were reported at consumption levels >190 mg/day.  
The issue of recall bias (i.e., a type of error associated with differences in the accuracy of 
recollections by cases and controls) is critical to interpreting findings of these studies. In each of 
these case-control studies, the controls were healthy children, thus the potential for differential 
accuracy in recalled caffeine intake reduces confidence in these findings. This topic was 
acknowledged by both the authors as well as by working group experts at the International 
Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) in the recent review of the potential carcinogenesis of 
coffee in which IARC concluded that overall coffee drinking was unclassifiable to its 
carcinogenicity to humans (Loomis et al., 2016). The limited number of studies, combined with 
the significant impact of potential recall bias, precluded the development of a conclusion for this 
SR but highlights the need for additional research that accommodates this significant bias in the 
future.

3.4.1.9 Prenatal exposure related to childhood behavior 
Three studies were included in the SR that investigated the association between prenatal caffeine 
exposure and childhood behavior outcomes. No associations were observed in these studies at 
levels at or higher than the comparator of 300 mg/day (Linnet et al., 2009; Loomans et al., 2012; 
Santos et al., 2012). In one study, maternal caffeine (>425 mg/day) was not associated with risk 
of problem behavior in children at age 5 years (Loomans et al., 2012) (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.49–
2.22); ORs for emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention problems, peer 
relationship problems, and prosocial behavior were similar. In another study, maternal caffeine 
consumption was not associated with childhood (median age 7 years) hyperkinetic disorder or 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at intakes ≥1000 mg/day; the adjusted RR for 10 
cups/day coffee was 2.3 (95% CI, 0.9–5.9) (Linnet et al., 2009). Because data were limited to 
three studies, no conclusion was developed; however, the lack of effects observed in all studies 
suggests that this is not an endpoint of concern. 
3.4.1.10 Other reproductive endpoints 
Additional reproductive endpoints were identified as meeting the SR criteria, but only one study 
was identified for each; thus, they are grouped and discussed briefly here as an “other” category, 
and no conclusions were developed. Of these, two studies reported that the outcomes of interest 
were not associated with caffeine intake levels at or above the respective comparator: pregnancy-
induced hypertensions and/or preeclampsia (NOEL of ≥540 mg/day; Bakker et al., 2011) and 
median age at menopause (NOEL of ≥400 mg/day; Kinney et al., 2006). In the third study, 
healthy pregnant women in their third trimester were evaluated for markers of maternal stress 
after consumption of 100 mg caffeine (in coffee) in a controlled trial (Tsubouchi et al., 2006). No

effects on maternal or fetal blood flow were observed (P < 0.05) using Doppler blood flow 
analysis and caffeine was shown to have a protective effect against other markers of stress 
measured as salivary cortisol level chromogranin A. 
3.4.2 Body of evidence assessment 
With regard to the overall outcome of reproductive and developmental effects, individual studies 
were generally associated with low risk of bias, with only five studies at the lower end of the 
spectrum and two at the higher end (Figures 9 and 10). The study ratings were most impacted by 
the confidence in exposure. As is inherent to these study types (as discussed elsewhere), very 
few studies involved direct evaluation of caffeine; rather, they involved self-reported estimates 
of consumption of caffeine-containing beverages. This topic was highlighted by Peck et al. 
(2010), in their conduct of a review aimed at characterizing potential reproductive health effects 
associated with caffeine consumption. The very small number of studies in which the authors 
made attempts to better quantify caffeine by analyzing beverage samples or biomonitoring in 
participants tend to better inform the body of evidence (Bracken et al., 2003; Santos et al., 2012; 
Tsubouchi et al., 2006).  
The current body of evidence characterizing this endpoint is generally consistent with what was 
reported by Nawrot et al. (2003); the majority of studies included in the SR do not report 
reproductive or developmental effects at levels below the relevant comparator. Although effects 
below 300 mg/day (or 400 mg/day, in the case of males and nonpregnant females) cannot be 
ruled out with the currently available data, the effects seen at these levels were primarily limited 
to isolated congenital malformations (Chen et al., 2012; Miller et al., 2009) or childhood cancers 
(Bonaventure et al., 2013; Plichart et al., 2008) and findings were of relatively low magnitude

98 
(ORs, <2). Effects on birth weight were also reported at intakes below the comparator; however, 
the biological significance of such an effect is more robustly evaluated in studies evaluating SGA 
or IUGR, which as a whole did not show effects below the comparator.  
Findings for some of these endpoints (e.g., birth defects and disease in offspring) can be 
significantly biased by poor study design, which was taken into consideration when developing 
conclusions. As noted in many of the studies reviewed, as well as review articles conducted prior 
to the SR, observational studies evaluating reproductive and developmental endpoints suffer 
from common limitations in study design. Although exposure assessment in most studies relies 
on self-reporting techniques such as telephone interviews and food frequency questionnaires, the 
timing and frequency of intake data collection varied widely between studies, with some 
analyzing intake data from before pregnancy and/or during one or more trimesters. In addition, 
the majority of studies utilized data collected at one time (often early in pregnancy) and 
calculated an average meant to represent the entire pregnancy. In addition to contributing to 
inconsistency between studies, the timing of intake relevant to the event or outcome should also 
be considered.  
In summary, the SR of 58 studies (55 observational; 3 RCTs) provided evidence to evaluate 
potential impacts of the consumption of 300 mg caffeine/day in pregnant women, or 400 mg/day 
in healthy adults, on reproductive and developmental effects. These studies included assessment 
of fecundability, fertility, male reproductive endpoints, spontaneous abortion, recurrent 
miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth and gestational age, fetal growth, birth defects, childhood 
cancers, and childhood behavior. When the weight of evidence was considered, an intake of 300 
mg caffeine/day in pregnant women and 400 mg/day in healthy adults are generally without 
significant concern regarding overt adverse effects on fecundability, fertility, male reproductive

endpoints, spontaneous abortion, recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth and gestational 
age, birth defects, and childhood behavior.  For some endpoints, including fetal growth, 
childhood cancers, isolated congenital malformations, evidence indicated that intake at the level 
of the comparator may be high; however, refined conclusions were difficult to determine given 
uncertainties in the evidence base, including low attrition rates, lack of ability to account for 
recall bias particularly for childhood cancers, lack of ability to fully accommodate the impact of 
the pregnancy signal, and lack of biological relevance of findings (referring primarily to fetal 
growth changes; the biological significance of such an effect is more robustly evaluated in 
studies evaluating SGA or IUGR, which, as a whole, did not support effects below the 
comparator). The relevance of smoking to the analyses in this data set was generally well 
recognized and, in most studies, the investigators attempted to control for such. There is a 
moderate level of confidence in the evidence base which supports this conclusion. 
The findings of this SR for the reproductive and developmental outcome are consistent with 
other reviews conducted prior to the SR on reproductive and developmental endpoints in general 
(Peck et al., 2010) as well as those considering individual endpoints (Brent et al., 2011; Christian 
and Brent, 2001; Peck et al., 2010). As such, the current guidance for pregnant women is 
supported by the findings of this SR. 
3.5 Acute toxicity 
Forty-six full text papers were reviewed for potential evaluation of acute toxicity; 26 were 
considered to meet the criteria for inclusion in the SR, as they permitted comparison to Nawrot et 
al. (2003) conclusions. Of the studies that were excluded, most were because they did not meet 
the inclusion criteria (e.g., the most common reasons were a nonhealthy population or 
 MANUSCRIPT

100
coadministration of caffeine with a drug), and the remaining few reports contained information 
regarding potential associations. All 26 of the included papers were case reports or case series, 
most of which were associated with emergency department (ED) visits and/or suicide-related 
events. As outlined in the protocol and methods, the inclusion/exclusion criteria differed slightly 
for this outcome relative to other outcomes in that these study types (i.e., case reports and case 
series) were allowed for inclusion in the acute outcome evaluation. Although these study types 
are generally regarded as having lower quality than other study types in humans (AHRQ, 2013; 
Cochrane Collaboration, 2011), inclusion of such studies is warranted when (a) there are no other 
studies to consider, and/or (b) the objective is to obtain information on rare and adverse effects 
(Eden et al., 2011; Fitzpatrick-Lewis et al., 2009). The endpoints of interest in this outcome 
(mainly death and severe intoxication) are rare and adverse; without inclusion of case reports and 
series, no data are currently available for evaluation.  
Regarding the populations of interest, the majority of the reports were described in adults, 
although four reports characterized acute effects in adolescents and two evaluated effects in 
pregnant women. No acute toxicity reports in children were found that met the criteria. The 
included cases involved adverse events associated with very high doses delivered over a 
relatively short time frame (up to 50 g); a few studies reported on repeated exposures. The 
majority of papers reviewed contained only brief discussions by the authors regarding the 
reported amount of caffeine ingested. The form of caffeine consumed varied; approximately half 
of the reports involved caffeine in a powder or tablet form (e.g., sleep aid), and the remaining 
reports involved energy drinks and a few involved cola as the source of caffeine. Some reports 
briefly mentioned ingested coffee or green tea but these beverages were not considered the major 
source of caffeine in the case reports reviewed. As discussed throughout this section, confidence 
 MANUSCRIPT

101
in the characterizations of exposure is low, since exposures were nearly always self-reports of 
caffeine ingestion (sometimes with corresponding corroboration by friends or relatives or 
confirmation via blood tests). Furthermore, it is commonly recognized by experts in emergency 
medicine and clinical toxicology that quantifying exposure from intoxications is reported with a 
general recognition of lack of confidence in the assessment of exposure (Brett, 1988; Heyerdahl 
et al., 2008; Wright, 1980). These shortcomings in study design were accounted for in the 
evaluation of internal validity, as well as in the consideration of the body of evidence as a whole.  
Acute effects associated with caffeine consumption have been described to result in a wide 
spectrum of symptoms, with headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, tremors, hyperventilation, 
dizziness, anxiety, tinnitus, and agitation at the milder end of the spectrum (Rudolph and 
Knudsen, 2010). More severe effects resulting from intoxication can include the following: 
abdominal pain, altered consciousness, rigidity, seizures, hypokalemia (low potassium), 
rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), increased blood lactate (acidosis), as well as 
supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia (Holmgren et al., 2004). 
Many of these changes would be expected at high doses, considering caffeine’s ability to 
stimulate the CNS, decrease smooth muscle tone, increase peripheral vascular resistance, and 
increase cerebrovascular resistance (Hering-Hanit and Gadoth, 2003). Kapur and Smith (2009) 
state that caffeine overdoses produce multiple symptoms, most of which are commonly 
associated with a marked increase in adrenergic tone, often including hypertension, tachycardia, 
dysrhythmias, and CNS and skeletal muscle stimulation. Acute toxicity for the purposes of this 
SR focused on consumption of caffeine in association with abuse, overdose, and potential death.  
Nawrot et al. (2003) did not comprehensively review these acute effects; rather, discussion 
included a brief characterization of mortality and caffeinism (which the authors characterize as a 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

102
syndrome associated with a range of effects such as restlessness, anxiety, irritability, sensory 
disturbances, cardiovascular symptoms, and others), as well as detrusor instability in women. 
Based on these, two different comparator values associated with acute effects were considered as 
defined in Nawrot et al. (2003). For nonfatal events and the spectrum of adverse events 
associated with acute toxicity, <400 mg/day was utilized. For fatal events, the comparator of 10 g 
from Nawrot et al. (2003)  was considered. Comparators for populations other than adults were 
undefined. 
3.5.1 Summary of individual studies by endpoint 
Of the 26 reports evaluated, 14 described death following exposure to caffeine, and the rest 
described other acute adverse effects (Figure 11). Notably, many of these reports were 
intentional overdoses of caffeine in suicide attempts. Because most reports included evaluation 
of both lethality and nonlethality, the subsequent subsections are organized by population and 
each subsection addresses both lethal and nonlethal endpoints.  
3.5.1.1 Acute lethality and nonlethality in adolescents 
Six case reports for adolescents (aged 15–18 years) were reviewed; these cases involved 
exposures ranging from 495 mg to ~51.6 g caffeine. Of the six total reports, one death was 
reported (Yamamoto et al., 2015) and the remaining five cases described various adverse 
outcomes (Babu et al., 2011; Kapur and Smith, 2009; Schmidt and Karlson-Stiber, 2008; Usman 
and Jawaid, 2012; Wilson et al., 2012). Three of the reports were related to attempted suicide 
events following exposures to caffeine via caffeine tablets at doses that were at or above the 
Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator (Kapur and Smith, 2009; Schmidt and Karlson-Stiber, 2008; 
Yamamoto et al., 2015). The only death involved ingestion of 51.6 g caffeine in the form of 
 MANUSCRIPT

103
antisleep tablets (Yamamoto et al., 2015) and was attributed to respiratory failure from brain 
hemorrhage; however, the authors note uncertainty in the classification. The two other reports 
were suicide gestures  that involved exposures to 12 g caffeine (Schmidt and Karlson-Stiber, 
2008), resulting in hyperventilation and increased lactate in the blood, and 10 g caffeine (Kapur 
and Smith, 2009), associated with cardiovascular collapse, respectively. Both of these patients 
presented with nausea, vomiting, tachycardia/cardiac instability, and hypokalemia and both fully 
recovered.  
Three of the six adolescent cases were misuse rather than suicide gestures. The self-reported 
doses were above the 400 mg comparator for nonfatal effects. Each case involved relatively high 
consumption of energy drinks or shots in short time frames, resulting in estimated caffeine 
exposures of 480 mg/day (Usman and Jawaid, 2012), 560–800 mg/day (Wilson et al., 2012), and 
495 mg/day (Babu et al., 2011). Two of the three cases required treatment; as described by the 
authors, one case returned to normal, one fully recovered, and one had no further seizure activity. 
The manifestation of adverse effects varied but similar effects observed included hypertension, 
heart palpitations, tachycardia, and hypokalemia. The case report by Babu et al. (2011) was 
unique in that seizures were documented in a patient not known to have a history of them.  
Following review of data from these six case reports involving assessment of acute toxicity in 
adolescents (aged 15–18 years), data support that the comparators of 10 g and 2.5 mg/kg/day for 
lethality and nonlethal endpoints, respectively, are acceptable. There is a very low to low level of 
confidence in the evidence base (Figure 11; Table 1). Confidence is limited by high risk of bias 
and likely publication bias; inherent to the case studies included, reports are limited to those 
reporting effects (and not reporting a lack of effects), as well as very low confidence in exposure 
estimates.

3.5.1.2 Lethality and nonlethality in adults 
There were 20 publications reviewed that reported on the potential for adverse acute toxicity in 
adults; the majority of these cases were reports from EDs. All lethality events were associated 
with suicide. Nonlethal effects included anxiety, hypokalemia, seizures, and myocardial 
infarction. Generally, fatal cases involved exposures to caffeine powder or tablets, whereas cases 
associated with nonfatal adverse events involved exposures to energy drinks or colas. 
Eight publications involving suicide attempts by caffeine ingestion were identified; all of these 
cases involved intake of anhydrous caffeine in powder or tablet form, and all cases except one 
had at consumption doses that were greater than or equal to the Nawrot et al. (2003) comparator 
of 10 g. Death occurred in three cases (Poussel et al., 2013; Rudolph and Knudsen, 2010; 
Thelander et al., 2010), all of which were associated with a reported 10-g ingestion (Figure 11A). 
Only one of these three exposures was validated by blood assay for caffeine (Poussel et al., 
2013). A myocardial event was reported cause of death in one case (Poussel et al., 2013). The 
other two patients died of brain damage (Thelander et al., 2010) and subsequent pneumonia 
(Rudolph and Knudsen, 2010). Sweats, trembling, rapid breathing, hypokalemia, and 
rhabdomyolysis were documented in all three of these cases. The remaining reports, all suicide 
gestures, described nonfatal adverse effects. Estimated exposure in these cases ranged from 1.1 g 
(Szpak and Allen, 2012) to 50 g (Bioh et al., 2013; Holstege et al., 2003). Bioh et al. (2013) and 
Holstege et al. (2003) both reported cases of exposure to 50 g caffeine in the form of caffeine 
powder and a dietary supplement, respectively. Both individuals suffered seizures, tachycardia, 
and forms of severe myocardial dysfunction (atrioventricular block or ventricular fibrillation 
arrest). Another case report of seizure occurred in a patient with schizophrenia who was admitted 
to the ED after ingesting 15.6 g caffeine from tablets (Ishigaki et al., 2014). Similar symptoms to

those noted above were documented: sudden onset of a tonic-clonic seizure and ventricular 
tachycardia. Campana et al. (2014) reported an estimated exposure was 24 g caffeine (120 No-
Doz tablets); adverse effects included uncontrollable vomiting, diarrhea, and intermittent loss of 
consciousness, followed by sustained severe rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and hepatic 
injury. Notably, no dysrhythmias were observed, which is a hallmark finding of caffeine 
overdose. The lowest dose reported in regard to attempted suicide was described by Szpak and 
Allen (2012). They presented a case report in which the subject ingested 14 cans of energy drink 
(1.1 g caffeine) over the course 2 nights and was extremely sleep deprived for 72 hours, which 
led to a state of mania-attempted suicide; little detail was provided on other adverse effects.  
Four additional fatal cases were discussed by Holmgren et al. (2004). Each death was the result 
of intentional consumption of a large caffeine dose (two of which were believed to be suicide 
related and the other two were uncertain). All estimated doses were at or above the comparator 
of 10 g caffeine. The reported doses were 10 g in three cases and 25 g in the fourth case (all 
doses were in tablet form). All four cases were noted as having previous drug or alcohol use or 
prior suicide attempts; very little additional information was provided, although blood levels 
were reported, confirming high exposure to caffeine, and ventricular fibrillation was noted as the 
cause of death. 
Death associated with accidental overdose (or unknown intentionality of consumption) was 
reported in two studies (Avci et al., 2013; Jabbar and Hanly, 2013), one of which was below the 
Nawrot comparator and one was above, respectively. In the first case, the patient was a self-
reported chronic consumer of energy drinks (one per day for 7 months) who reported intake of 
240 mg caffeine 5 hours before playing in a basketball match. Adverse events included heart 
palpitation, nausea, loss of consciousness, tachycardia, and death from cardiac arrest. Jabbar and

Hanly (2013) reported a case of an individual found dead by a friend and who was believed to 
have ingested 10–12 g caffeine powder. Because the patient was dead upon arrival, the authors 
state that estimates were based on residual contents of a bag of pure caffeine powder found on 
the decedent and the subject’s stomach contents and extremely high caffeine blood values. No 
other details were provided. 
There were a number of publications in which attempted suicide was not the intent of 
consumption. These studies described high doses of caffeine ingested in short periods of time 
with nonfatal adverse events manifest (Berger and Alford, 2009; Dikici et al., 2015; Jonjev and 
Bala, 2013) (Figure 11B). All three of these publications involved exposure to caffeinated energy 
drinks, in which estimated exposures were both above and below the Nawrot et al. (2003) 
comparator of 400 mg and some form of myocardial adverse event was noted. Berger and Alford 
(2009) reported an ED visit following reported ingestion of 560–640 mg caffeine over 7 hours 
during motocross racing; the patient experienced a myocardial infarction and hypokalemia as 
well as transmural ischemia. Jonjev and Bala (2013) discussed three cases in which they 
suspected caffeine ingestions were associated with aortic dissections (tear in inner layer of the 
aorta). Caffeine exposures were estimated at 240 mg/day, 320–400 mg/day, and 400–480 
mg/day, respectively. Dikici et al. (2015) reported a transient ischemic attack occurring after 
self-reported consumption of two energy drinks (~167 mg) and sudden-onset loss of vision in the 
right eye, which spontaneously resolved after 4 hours.  
Two caffeine-associated seizure-related events were also reviewed (Calabrò et al., 2012; Trabulo 
et al., 2011). Both report exposure to caffeine from energy drinks that were above and below the 
comparator of 400 mg/day. Calabrò et al. (2012) discussed a witnessed epileptic seizure in a 
patient with no known history of seizure or associated conditions, in which the authors estimated 
 MANUSCRIPT

107
consumption of 340–480 mg caffeine/day. Trabulo et al. (2011) reported a case with a reported 
exposure of 500 mg caffeine over 4 hours; postictal state, tonic-clonic seizures, and 
supraventricular tachycardia were reported. Mudge and Johnson (2004) described a patient with 
possible ingestion of 400 mg to 1 g/day from cola; symptoms included hypokalemia, muscle 
weakness, and respiratory depression (requiring intubation).  
Ogawa and Ueki (2007) discussed two patient cases not associated with ED visits, but rather 
with long-term use of caffeine at high doses, both of which exceed the Nawrot et al. (2003) 
comparator of 400 mg (case 1, >640 mg/day from energy drinks; case 2, 1365–1450 mg/day 
from a combination of instant coffee, green tea, and caffeine tablets). The authors diagnosed 
these patients with substance abuse disorder. Adverse effects included euphoria, mania, 
excessive talking, hyperactivity, anxiety, and sleep disorder for case 1 and tachycardia, flushing, 
cold sweats, anxiety, agitation, and sleep disturbance for case 2. Medical treatment was 
administered and both patients recovered. 
Following review of data from these 20 reports involving assessment of acute toxicity in adults, 
it was determined that the comparators of 10 g and 400 mg/day for lethality and nonlethal 
endpoints, respectively, are acceptable. There was a very low to low level of confidence in the 
evidence base. Confidence is limited by high risk of bias (likely publication bias) (Figure 11; 
Table 1); inherent to the case studies included, reports are limited to those reporting effects (and 
not reporting a lack of effects), as well as very low confidence in exposure estimates.  
3.5.1.3 Acute effects in pregnant women 
Our review included two separate reports of pregnant women that experienced acute effects 
associated with self-reported high amounts  due to ingestion of large volumes of cola (Appel and

Myles, 2001; Young et al., 2001) (Figure 11). Both women presented with muscular paralysis 
and hypokalemia; consumption estimates associated with these nonfatal endpoints were 900 
mg/day and 288–850 mg/day for the respective cases. Both cases recovered following routine 
supportive care. There is a very low to low level of confidence that these data are indirectly 
supportive of the comparator of 300 mg/day; however, these data were not considered sufficient 
to develop a conclusion.  
3.5.2 Body of evidence assessment 
Overall, the current body of evidence characterizing this endpoint is generally consistent with 
what was reported by Nawrot et al. (2003), which suggests the potential for death following 
acute exposures of approximately 10 g caffeine. Seven of the fatal case reports documented 
death following ingestion of ~10 g caffeine (Holmgren et al., 2004; Jabbar and Hanly, 2013; 
Poussel et al., 2013; Rudolph and Knudsen, 2010; Thelander et al., 2010) or higher, such as 24 g 
(Holmgren et al., 2004) or 51.6 g (Yamamoto et al., 2015). There was only one report of death at 
a lower dose than the 10 g. Avci et al. (2013) suggested that an exposure to 240 mg was 
associated with cardiac arrest; this case appears to be an outlier and/or associated with other 
factors (e.g., preexisting conditions), given that the patient had been consuming similar amounts 
for months prior without effects and because it is not consistent with the other case studies 
evaluated. Five reports described survival following consumption at a dose at or above the 
comparator: 10–12 g (Kapur and Smith, 2009; Schmidt and Karlson-Stiber, 2008) or 
significantly higher, such as 15–24 g (Campana et al., 2014; Ishigaki et al., 2014) or even 50 g 
(Bioh et al., 2013; Holstege et al., 2003). As such, the data support that for healthy individuals, 
lethality may, but does not always,  occur following acute consumption of 10g caffeine.

109
The review of the data also generally supports a lack of nonlethal acute effects at or below 
exposures of 400 mg/day. As with the reports evaluating death, the confidence in exposure is 
very low and, in many of these studies, existing conditions were often thought to have 
potentiated the effects observed with caffeine. For example, Jonjev and Bala (2013) indicated 
that a dose of 240 mg from energy drink consumption was possibly associated with greater 
serious cardiovascular event (aortic tears) in an individual with known underlying heart disease, 
possibly provoking a potential fatal cardiovascular event. Yet the authors reached the conclusion 
in regard to uncontrolled consumption of “high-energy” drinks and not in direct regard to the 
dose of caffeine discussed. Thus, for the majority of endpoints discussed as associated with acute 
intoxication, the body of evidence suggests a general lack of acute toxicity concern following 
exposure to 400 mg caffeine in healthy individuals.  
With respect to acute toxicity, it was notable that each case appeared to have a rather unique 
spectrum of adverse events, although commonly reported events included vasospasm, seizure,  
mania, hypokalemia, and muscle weakness. Nearly all of the case reports describing fatalities 
involved caffeine powder and tablets, whereas the case reports associated with other acute effects 
generally involved rapid consumption of caffeinated beverages over a short time. Based on the 
limited data available, no particular population appeared to be more sensitive; however, there are 
insufficient data to discern whether adolescents or pregnant women were more at risk for acute 
toxicity or death. No case reports that fit the criteria were found for children; thus, doses required 
to produce adverse effects in that population remain an area of uncertainty. However, the fact 
that no cases were identified in this SR may support that current consumption practices do not 
warrant concern.

Critical to the assessment of acute toxicity is the recognition that case reports and case series are 
considered to be of lesser quality than other study types with respect to overall confidence and 
weight in describing a body of evidence. The majority of studies included were generally 
associated with a high risk of bias rating, although studies ranged the spectrum from probably 
low to definitely high (Figure 12). The study ratings were most impacted by the confidence in 
exposure, as is inherent to these case studies in which the individual self-reported intake or 
intake was characterized by health care providers’ estimation. There was a large number of 
reports that evaluated toxicity associated with caffeine in tablets; however, because these reports 
were not controlled (e.g., estimates based on number of tablets left in a package) and blood 
caffeine levels often were not measured, uncertainty remains as to the complete dose 
characterization. Uncertainty is also inherent to the estimations of caffeine from self-reported 
exposure; efforts were made to standardize these estimates, although there could be large 
variability in products and descriptions of amounts consumed. As would be expected, the studies 
in which authors made attempts to specifically quantify or verify the self-reported caffeine level 
tend to better inform the body of evidence. Furthermore, when interpreting these data, it is 
notable to consider both that (1) the caffeine doses discussed herein do not represent typical 
consumer exposures and (2) because of the nature of the study type (i.e., case report), the 
evidence base for this outcome is inherently biased toward demonstration of effect (i.e., case 
reports do not often demonstrate a lack of effect). 
In summary, the SR of 26 studies provided evidence to evaluate potential acute toxicity. 
Following a weight of evidence review, the comparators of 10 g for lethality and 400 mg/day or 
2.5 mg/kg/day for other acute effects, were determined to be acceptable for healthy adults and 
adolescents, respectively. There is very low to low confidence in this evidence base, due 
 MANUSCRIPT

111
primarily to uncertainty in the estimates of exposure and to the high risk of bias. A higher level 
of confidence is also precluded by the inherent bias introduced by utilizing case reports (i.e., 
limitations to reporting of effects versus no effects). Insufficient and/or lack of data precluded 
conclusions related to acute toxicity for children and pregnant women. 
3.6 Caffeine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
PK parameters were evaluated contextually with the aim to provide information in target 
populations that are not as well characterized relative to adults (e.g., children, adolescents, 
pregnant women), as well as to identify literature that aids in providing context to some of the 
potential adverse effects observed (PD). The PK of caffeine in healthy adults is well established, 
a summary of such is provided in Supplementary File S3. Our search criteria aimed to capture all 
relevant papers for caffeine that may have contained PK and PD data published since Nawrot et 
al. (2003), with specific focus on individual variation in metabolism and other pharmacogenomic 
variability. Studies that were deemed to contain important information to advance the 
understanding of caffeine PK/PD were systematically identified and carefully reviewed, and the 
findings are summarized in this section. However, these papers were not evaluated for risk of 
bias or evaluated as an overall body of evidence, given the wide range of endpoints associated 
with the topic. Fifty-seven studies were reviewed for relevant PK data, and 46 studies contained 
relevant PK information in context of a target outcome (PD), resulting in review of ~100 studies 
(combined from the PK category only and PK information from other outcomes; Figure 2). For 
brevity, information by outcome is provided in Supplementary File S3 and a summary of key 
findings is presented below.

Since caffeine PK has been relatively well understood for decades, more recent research in the 
area of caffeine metabolism has focused on how one’s own genetic makeup leads to 
interindividual differences in how caffeine is handled by the body. The most common PK/PD 
topic reviewed was in relation to how small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been 
characterized, further helping to elucidate individual differences in caffeine metabolism and even 
consumption practices. Simply put, this work evaluated changes at the allele level in genes and 
subsequent association of changes in how one’s body handles exposure to caffeine. As an 
example, the ADORA2A gene encodes the adenosine A2A receptor; several studies evaluated 
how polymorphisms in this gene can affect individual sensitivity to caffeine, including 
differences in anxiogenic responses (e.g., Thorn et al., 2012; Yamada et al., 2014; Yang et al., 
2010). For example, following acute caffeine consumption, light caffeine users with ADORA2A 
SNPs rs5751876 (T/T) and rs35320474 (T/T) reported increased feelings of anxiety (Alsene et 
al., 2003; Childs and de Wit, 2008). However, genotypic variation in ADORA2A (i.e., 1083TT) 
was also linked to decreased caffeine intake (Cornelis et al., 2007).  
A number of studies further evaluated pharmacogenomic variations in caffeine associated with 
CYP1A2*1F (variant rs762551, genotype AA) and the CYP1A2*1K alleles, which are associated 
with increased and decreased caffeine metabolism, respectively (Arnaud, 2011; Cornelis et al., 
2011; Josse et al., 2012; McLean and Graham, 2002; Sulem et al., 2011; Thorn et al., 2012; Vink 
et al., 2009). Two studies reported that gender has not been shown to consistently affect most 
caffeine pharmacokinetic parameters but men may have higher CYP1A2 activity than women 
(Arnaud, 2011; McLean and Graham, 2002). Interestingly, it was hypothesized more recently 
that caffeine consumption itself may be a heritable trait (estimated 43–58% from twin studies) 
that may be influenced by CYP1A2 genotype (Cornelis et al., 2011). For example, CYP1A2 
 MANUSCRIPT

113
variants (i.e., rs2470893 and rs2472297, allele T) have been linked to increased coffee 
consumption (Cornelis et al., 2011; Josse et al., 2012; Sulem et al., 2011; Thorn et al., 2012). 
Coffee consumption and the preference of coffee over tea (perhaps due to differences in 
perceived bitterness) was also demonstrated to be somewhat heritable in a Dutch twin study 
(Vink et al., 2009). 
Collectively, data are beginning to provide insight into potential epigenetic trends or effects, 
including further characterizations of SNPs believed to be associated with consumption practices 
(e.g., self-regulation), as well as specific effects, including several behavioral endpoints (i.e., 
mood, tolerance, withdrawal). Understanding the metabolism, pharmacology, and mechanism of 
action of caffeine is helpful to interpreting its effects, adverse or otherwise, throughout the body. 
This review of newer PK/PD data further highlights the importance of taking PK into 
consideration, in particular the individual variation presented in caffeine’s targets or metabolic 
enzymes, when interpreting overall findings, as well as future endeavors to characterize sensitive 
effects or sensitive populations.  
4. Discussion 
In line with our goal of updating the work of Health Canada (Nawrot et al., 2003), the possibility 
that caffeine ingestion adversely affects human health at moderate levels of consumption (400 
mg/day in health adults, 300 mg/day in healthy pregnant women, and 2.5 mg/kg/day in children 
and adolescents) was investigated via the IOM SR approach (Eden et al., 2011). The review 
focused on five outcomes: calcium and bone status, cardiovascular effects, behavioral effects, 
reproductive and developmental toxicity, and acute toxicity. Data on these outcomes were 
obtained from the assessment of 380 studies; for each study, information as reported by the 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
114
authors was extracted, and an evaluation of study quality and applicability (i.e., internal validity 
and external validity) was conducted. The body of evidence for each health outcome was then 
reviewed and conclusions were developed using a weight of evidence approach. Considerations 
of quality of the evidence base, consistency in findings, magnitude of response, and level of 
adverseness were critical to determining whether the comparator (the intake value established by 
Nawrot et al. in 2003) remained acceptable—that is, the value was unlikely to be associated with 
adverse effects. Only studies that were published from January 2001- June 2015 were included in 
this SR, a necessary limitation give the extensive literature on caffeine that continuously appears 
in the scientific literature. 
In taking the SR approach, data were included only if they allowed for direct comparison—that 
is, they provided data on an intake amount  (mg/day or similar) relative to an outcome (findings 
that only reported on potential associations between caffeine consumption and an outcome, 
without commenting on a specific dose relative to an endpoint, were not included). Notably, 
selected data from each study were then utilized to represent findings in the figures presented 
throughout this review; however, these representations do not incorporate the contextual data and 
considerations of individual study quality and level of adverseness (discussed below) that are 
required for development of conclusions. Such an approach was required, given the voluminous 
nature of the evidence base; detailed reporting of intricacies or interesting findings from each 
individual study were beyond the scope of this review and discussion. This approach did, 
however, allow the opportunity to highlight information most relevant to determinations, to 
assess new areas (endpoints) evaluated since the publication of the study by Nawrot et al. (2003), 
and to suggest topics for future research.

Similar to the observations of Nawrot et al. (2003), the evidence base was complicated, as each 
individual study presented design issues (e.g., inadequate measurement of caffeine intake) or 
variability across outcomes (e.g., inconsistent techniques used to evaluate endpoints or 
inconsistent control for confounding variables). Despite these issues, useful data were available 
to evaluate the PECO; however, expert judgement (which included contextual considerations of 
each dataset) was required on behalf of the analyst and outcome experts were required in 
developing weight of the evidence conclusions. All data considered are provided via a 
combination of materials, including this manuscript, the Supplementary Material, and additional 
supplemental materials available in the AHRQ repository (SRDR link forthcoming). 
Overall, the evidence generally supports the findings of Nawrot et al. (2003); however, there 
were exceptions for some endpoints within most outcomes evaluated. That is, when the total 
body of evidence was evaluated and study quality, consistency, level of adversity, and magnitude 
of response were considered, the evidence generally supports that consumption of up to 400 mg 
caffeine/day in healthy adults is generally not associated with adverse cardiovascular effects, 
behavioral effects, reproductive effects, acute effects, or bone status. Evidence also supports that 
a daily consumption of up to 300 mg caffeine/day in healthy pregnant women is generally not 
associated with adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Very limited data were 
identified for child and adolescent populations; the available evidence suggests that 2.5 mg 
caffeine/day remains an acceptable recommendation.  
Consistent with Nawrot et al. (2003), as well as other recent reviews (EFSA, 2015; McGuire, 
2014; Milanez, 2011), some of the endpoints (blood pressure, anxiety, calcium homeostasis, and, 
to a lesser extent, sleep) had effects  more readily observed at exposures below the comparator 
than others, indicating the potential that these may be sensitive effects. However, when 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

116
interpreting these data, considerations were given to the following: the dose and conditions under 
which such effects were observed, the type of effect (clinical/physiological), and the potential 
link to downstream effects. These parameters, collectively, aid in characterizing the level of 
adversity with respect to the individual study, as well as the body of evidence for each endpoint 
and each outcome. Extensive considerations were given to making a priori determinations of 
adversity during problem formulation and scoping. It was recognized early during the process 
that in conducting a broad review, there would be a wide array of endpoints to potentially 
evaluate. Based on expert review (J.G., M.T., C.O., H.L., J.P.) during screening, endpoints 
considered to be not clearly adverse were excluded. For many endpoints, such as blood pressure, 
it was difficult to make blanket designations, as the potential for an endpoint to be adverse was 
conditional; thus, such endpoints were included. However, thresholds or specific parameters 
under which endpoints were considered to be adverse were not determined a priori. Thus, 
recognizing that the pharmacological effects of caffeine are anticipated to cause physiological 
changes, characterization of the level of adverseness added complexity to this assessment, 
because not all physiological changes are adverse.  
Given the basic pharmacology of caffeine behavioral changes are to be expected, particularly its 
primary mechanism of action, blocking adenosine receptors.  A good example is that increased 
alertness is to be expected. However, under some conditions, such as when caffeine is consumed 
before bedtime these actions can also be associated with adverse effects such as difficulty 
sleeping. Thus, differentiation of desirable and undesirable effects (Guyatt et al., 2011) is an 
important aspect to the interpretation of adversity. Quantitative differentiation of desirable and 
undesirable effects (including conditions under which these could be characterized) for each of 
these endpoints would have been a large undertaking in itself, one that was beyond the scope of 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

117
the assessment. In these cases, considerations of the magnitude of change, as well as the 
consistency of such relative to downstream effects, aided in informing the level of adversity. For 
blood pressure as well as other physiological endpoints within the cardiovascular outcome, the 
magnitude of changes was relatively small (although statistically significant in the studies) and 
transient in nature, may only affect specific subsets of the population (specific genotypes), and 
may be subject to tolerance in adult habitual caffeine consumers. In addition, because much of 
the data for these endpoints, and in particular the physiological endpoints within cardiovascular 
outcome, were obtained from short-term (often single exposure) controlled trials, the datasets for 
these endpoints would not provide sufficient evidence to characterize potential long-term effects 
of caffeine on cardiovascular health. Similar conditions apply to the interpretation of changes in 
calcium homeostasis; such changes were observed in short-term (single exposure) studies and 
were not determined to be of consequence to the overall calcium economy.  
In the behavior outcome, sleep disruption is an example where a majority of studies indicated the 
potential for effects at exposures below the comparator depending of course on the time of 
consumption and dose consumed. The evidence characterizing effects on sleep also highlights 
the difficulty of characterizing adversity relative to desirable and anticipated effects, considering 
that caffeine is intentionally ingested to avoid sleepiness and is pharmacologically proven to 
enhance alertness. With respect to the data in this SR, many of the studies showing effects below 
the comparator were studies in which there was a deliberate intention of studying the effect of 
caffeine on sleep. These data support the potential for an effect; however, as discussed by 
Nawrot et al. (2003), consumers are likely to self-limit caffeine intake to avoid negative effects 
on sleep. Wesensten (2014) recently discussed this phenomenon, pointing out that caffeine 
indeed can have a negative impact on sleep and explaining that caffeine is so effective at doing 
 MANUSCRIPT

118
what is intended (blocking sleep) that partakers should expect it reasonable that caffeine could 
disrupt subsequent sleep. Turnbull et al. (2016) also discuss this concept in a review of 
neurobehavioral hazard, indicating that the potential effect of caffeine on sleep (particularly 
when consumed close to normal sleep time) is well known, thus leading many consumers to 
refrain from consuming caffeinated beverages late in the day.   
Similar to sleep and in the behavior outcome, anxiety was an example of an endpoint where a 
majority of studies indicated the potential for effects at exposures below the comparator, 
although there were a number of inconsistencies between studies that could be a result of the 
individuals studied (e.g., genetic polymorphisms; Alsene et al., 2003; Childs and de Wit, 2008; 
Domschke et al., 2012; Rogers et al., 2010). The data from our SR also support the Nawrot et al. 
(2003) finding that consumer self-regulation and awareness of potential sensitivities (e.g., 
anxiety disorders) is important for avoiding caffeine-induced anxiety. Nawrot et al. (2003) also 
pointed out that consideration must be given to the possibility that some of these subjective 
effects categorized as “anxiety” may also be related to caffeine’s ability to increase alertness and 
arousal.  A review by Cappelletti et al. (2015) supports this assertion, emphasizing that these 
anxiogenic responses tend to occur at higher doses, above the lower concentrations which 
produce stimulating effects.  One’s own perception of sensitivity may be very different than 
another; to this end, the concept of self-limitation remains a research gap. However, in light of 
inconsistent results in the literature and individual differences in sensitivity to caffeine, some 
people (e.g., those with anxiety disorders) should be aware of the possible adverse effects of 
caffeine and should limit their intake accordingly. A SR by Ruxton (2014) focused on children 
and adolescents and also confirmed that moderate caffeine intake is unlikely to cause harmful 
effects, also supporting the 2.5 mg/kg/day  as an acceptable protective limit. The authors go on to 
 MANUSCRIPT

comment that more research should be done at higher doses, as they note that increased anxiety 
and withdrawal symptoms were manifest at exposures on the order of >5 mg/kg/day. Our review 
also suggests that this remains a potential research gap (i.e., to investigate caffeine effects at 
levels >2.5 mg/kg/day  on anxiety in children and at >400 mg in adults with preexisting 
conditions). 
Thus, for all of the above reasons, we encourage considerations of magnitude and level of 
adversity when interpreting data from the figures presented herein, as opposed to solely 
acknowledging that an “effect” was reported. One can easily see from the collection of figures 
that effects are manifest below the comparator, many of which are directly associated with the 
pharmacodynamic properties of caffeine. The goal of the exercise, however, was to go beyond 
the simple comparisons and to integrate the data using a weight of evidence approach that 
accommodates the concepts described above (e.g., level of adversity [severity] and consistency; 
OHAT, 2015a). It is also important to note that while the plots presented throughout are meant to 
provide a summary graphic of the studies reviewed, they do not necessarily reflect all data 
presented in each study, nor do they provide an “equal weight” per study. For example, per the 
internal process implemented, data were selected for graphical representation based on the most 
refined set of analyses presented by the authors; thus, not all subsets of analyses conducted, or

subgroup or subset of the data (e.g., BMD at a single site versus overall, represented by different

study, including displaying all findings reported or critically evaluation strengths or limitations 
within the body of the manuscript.  
In evaluating individual studies, several themes in study design elements were observed. One 
example is the consideration of the pregnancy signal in the context of, primarily, spontaneous 
abortion, as well as stillbirth and fetal growth (Brent et al., 2011; Lawson et al., 2004; Peck et al., 
2010; Stein and Susser, 1991). As discussed in the section on reproduction and development 
(Section 3.4), this phenomenon relates to the fact that caffeine consumption has been shown to 
change over the course of pregnancy (Nawrot et al., 2003; Peck et al., 2010). This is important to 
note because pregnancy symptoms including nausea, aversion to smells or tastes, and vomiting 
(typically described as morning sickness) are more common in healthy pregnancies that result in 
live births (Hinkle et al., 2016; Nippita and Dodge, 2016). This “aversion” is associated with 
what is called the pregnancy signal (Lawson et al., 2004). Research has found that women who 
have higher concentrations of pregnancy hormones that are known to be associated with 
healthier pregnancies are more likely to exhibit the aversion habits and practices. By nature of 
aversion to strong smells (e.g., coffee), such aversions can lead to a decrease in caffeine since it 
is found in strong-smelling coffee. As such, accounting for the pregnancy signal, although it is 
complex, has been found to be critical for assessing endpoints such as spontaneous abortion and 
stillbirth, and potentially for fetal growth, because the symptoms may reflect the status of the 
pregnancy and resultant influence on caffeine intake levels (Brent et al., 2011; Lawson et al., 
2004; Peck et al., 2010; Stein and Susser, 1991). Although most studies on spontaneous abortion 
(seven of the eight in this review) considered this phenomenon using some measure of nausea as 
an indicator, the approach for doing so varied and existing measures of the presence or frequency 
of nausea may not provide a valid assessment of the relevant aspects of aversion (and hence the

weighting of this factor in the RoB assessment), which may explain some of variability in 
evaluation of these endpoints (Hinkle et al., 2016; Nawrot et al., 2003; Nippita and Dodge, 2016; 
Peck et al., 2010).  
Also of importance, but not unique, to the reproductive and developmental body of evidence is 
the issue of recall bias (i.e., a type of error associated with differences in the accuracy of 
recollections by cases and controls), as well as the impact of timing on recall bias (Werler et al., 
1989, 2011). The observed differences were considered as a weakness across the body of 
evidence within the SR and were reflected in the quality of evidence assessment. Relevant to 
future research areas, the work of Werler et al.  suggests that an approach for potentially 
minimizing recall bias in case-control studies of rare endpoints such as childhood cancer or 
malformations  would be to choose a control group from the same source population who also 
had offspring with other cancers or malformations unrelated to the exposure of interest. Since the 
effect of caffeine on childhood cancer rate seems to be an emerging area of interest for the 
outcome of reproductive and developmental effects, well-controlled studies using this guidance 
may be useful to address concerns of differential accuracy for retrospective reporting of prior 
caffeine exposures.. 
One of the largest areas of uncertainties in the underlying body of evidence assessed herein was 
the characterization of exposure, the findings of which are demonstrated by the (primarily red) 
color coding on risk of bias questions 8 and 11 (see Figures 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). Although not a 
new complication (Peck et al., 2010), the simple concept that caffeine is consumed via a variety 
of sources complicates clear evaluation of the exposure-response relationship. Several of the 
sources included in this SR are complex mixtures with other potentially active compounds and 
the amount of caffeine within each substance can be highly variable. This is a particular issue for 
 MANUSCRIPT

122
coffee (Mitchell et al., 2014), which was the primary substance evaluated in >20% of studies 
assessed in this SR. Despite attempts to standardize this metric using our decision tree (a unique 
strength of this assessment), very few studies validated the amount of caffeine in the respective 
sources (though validation is generally not feasible in many observational population studies, 
some studies used validated exposure surveys) or the purity of caffeine (topics that directly 
impact the risk of bias scoring). It should be noted, however, that the evidence also contains a 
large number of controlled trials in which exposure was well characterized, although these 
studies were primarily associated with physiological endpoints. Because the complexities in 
exposure were well characterized, it was recognized a priori that the uncertainties in exposure 
assessment associated with this research question had to be accepted and attempts were made to 
address and/or standardize uncertainties. We did not, however, choose to exclude studies based 
on such given this recognition (the OHAT handbook describes a tiered process in which studies 
having a high risk of bias for key domains, including exposure, can be excluded) combined with 
the objective of providing a comprehensive assessment of available literature. 
 
The condition under which these sources are consumed further complicates evaluation of the 
exposure-response relationship. This SR evaluated consumption of caffeine amounts within a 
day; however, consistent with the kinetic behavior of caffeine, effects may vary based on how 
the caffeine is consumed within a day. The most dramatic example in the SR dataset being that 
lethality events were associated with rapid and excessive consumption of capsules or powders 
(the comparator for lethality [10 g] is equivalent to ~100 cups of coffee). These findings are 
supportive of regulatory measures to restrict the number of capsules per entire pack (Thelander et 
al., 2010), as well as public warnings regarding the dangers of caffeine powder (FDA, 2015).

More commonly in the dataset, however, are considerations for consumption of caffeine prior to 
bedtime, or studies that evaluated repeated exposure in a day. Although these aspects are 
important for developing conclusions, they were only considered contextually as the overall 
exposure was standardized to daily intake for comparison purposes. More in-depth assessments 
of specific endpoints or sensitivities, particularly if data are to be used quantitatively as candidate 
datasets for health protective values, should consider such conditions.  
When determining outcome and overall conclusions, considerations of the level of adversity, or 
the relative importance (severity) of each endpoint within an outcome, was critical (Eden et al., 
2011; Guyatt et al., 2011). These considerations are standard in the practice of SR. In the clinical 
field, such designations are often evaluated using the GRADE system, applied herein, in which 
determinations of outcome importance are conducted by categorizing outcomes on a spectrum 
from limited importance for decision making to critical importance for decision making (Guyatt 
et al., 2011). When the caffeine data are assessed using such considerations, the evidence 
regarding the safety of the comparators evaluated herein is stronger for the endpoints categorized 
as having a higher level of adversity (i.e., clinical effects determined to be of “high” importance 
to decision making) relative to those considered to have a lower level of adversity. For example, 
when data from cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Figure 5A), reproductive and 
developmental outcomes (Figure 9), and nonfatal acute effects (Figure 11B) are considered, the 
data more strongly support the appropriateness of the comparator values. The SR datasets on 
these endpoints also have more data on and above the comparator than other datasets, which 
increases confidence. In endpoints of lesser adversity, which are primarily physiological and/or 
of lesser clinical significance, there is a higher frequency of effects at consumption levels below 
the comparator. It is also notable that while the presence of a dose response relationship was 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
124
recorded, it was ultimately determined that dose-response data as collected were not a good fit 
for determining confidence in the body of evidence relative to the research question (see 
Methods). While demonstration of a dose provides strength in demonstrating a relationship, the 
objective of this assessment was not to evaluate the presence of a relationship per se, but rather 
to evaluate the potential for a relationship at or below the comparator intakes. Specifically, it was 
difficult to integrate the data collected regarding the potential presence of a relationship (at any 
intake, as recorded in this SR), relative to the specific question under investigation herein (a 
specific intake). Moreover, the frameworks utilized herein to evaluate the quality of evidence, 
including the assessment of dose-response, seemed to be better suited for evaluating evidence as 
it relates to positive findings rather than absence of effects – and in this case, a framework is 
need that integrates both.  These complexities highlights the need for continued development of  
– as well as flexibility in - guidance and frameworks for the application of toxicology in SR, as 
many assessment will have a similar focus – that is – characterization of safe levels (vs 
characterization of potential hazard).  
Another complex problem associated with developing conclusions was consideration of habitual 
or chronic consumption relative to the effect being evaluated; specifically control for issues such 
in study design or consideration of confounding issues (e.g., withdrawal). Cessation of caffeine 
use in habitual consumers has been associated with withdrawal. Since the publication by Nawrot 
et al. (2003), the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) has been published and caffeine withdrawal 
became an officially recognized diagnosis in DSM-5. An official diagnosis related to caffeine 
may be confusing to the majority of people who use it safely every day (Addicott, 2014). 
Addicott explains that DSM-IV actually recognized caffeine intoxication, which included use of 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
125
caffeine >250 mg and five or more symptoms (e.g., restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, 
gastrointestinal distress, and tachycardia) but did not include withdrawal as a disorder because 
data were lacking. In contrast, DSM-5 now includes withdrawal as a disorder and includes 
headache as one of the symptoms. Although our review supported that headache was not 
associated with caffeine at doses <400 mg/day, we did note that headache in the context of 
withdrawal was sometimes mentioned by the authors in their study design. Headache is often 
discussed in context with caffeine withdrawal but seems to remain controversial (Dews et al., 
2002; Torelli et al., 2009). Nawrot et al. (2003) discussed the cessation of caffeine being 
associated with headache and also discussed withdrawal as a hypothesis for their onset at both 
low and high doses. Furthermore, controversy exists and it should be expected that individuals 
will have variability in severity of symptoms; withdrawal in general is short lived and relatively 
mild in those affected. Knowledge of potential consequences of withdrawal or conversely the 
consequences of testing caffeine-naïve individuals should be taken into account by researchers 
when possible.  
In this SR’s underlying dataset, control for habitual consumption and/or withdrawal varied 
greatly, ranging from no consideration of, to cessation prior to participation in controlled trials, 
to being a main focus of a study evaluating effects (e.g., Brown et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2009). 
Habituation for caffeine typically results in larger doses needed to produce an effect (Dews et al., 
2002). Of interest, habituation has been associated with the observation of U-shaped dose-
response curves. For example, in one study, Happonen et al. (2004) offered one interpretation for 
this observation such that naïve and heavy users of caffeine (>800 mg/day) were at a relatively 
greater risk of cardiovascular risk than those who habitually consumed moderate levels of 
caffeine. A review (Zulli et al., 2016) of this topic concluded that recent trends in studies of 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

126
habitual caffeine consumption and adverse cardiovascular effects (CVD or coronary heart 
disease) suggest a neutral or even possibly a protective effect of caffeine. A similar conclusion 
was reached by Cappelletti et al, 2015 who found extensive evidence that there was little to no 
effect of caffeine on coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Thus, the role, or 
consideration, of habituation and withdrawal is an important factor to consider in future research, 
as well as in characterization of adversity of the data presented herein.  
The data in this study also support findings from previous investigations, which demonstrate that 
there are a variety of kinetic parameters that influence the potential for adverse effects, 
highlighting interindividual differences in responses. Some of the data reviewed in this SR had 
emphasis on genotype/phenotype implications and, in particular, differences related to CYP1A2 
and COMT genes and subsequent impacts on caffeine metabolism, bone and calcium, or 
cardiovascular effects. Several studies also investigated polymorphisms in the ADORA2A gene 
and resulting impacts on anxiety and sleep caused by changes in the adenosine A2A receptor. 
The health effects of these genotype/phenotype differences for many of these endpoints has also 
been recently discussed in a review by Pourshahidi et al. (2016). More research is needed, 
however, to meaningfully translate genotypic variation into public health recommendations. The 
complexities of these interindividual differences are further compounded by potential differences 
in PK introduced by the rate of consumption as well as the temperature and manner consumed—
areas of interest to future investigations (White et al., 2016).  
In the last few years, three large governmental assessments of caffeine have been issued (DGAC, 
2015; EFSA, 2015; Milanez, 2011), as well as an updated assessment of carcinogenicity 
associated with coffee consumption (Loomis et al., 2016). Most recently, EFSA (2015) 
commissioned an internal SR of literature (Bull et al., 2015) and, based on such, concluded that 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
127
habitual caffeine consumption up to 400 mg/day does not give rise to safety concerns for 
nonpregnant women. The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) reached a 
similar conclusion, stating that “strong and consistent evidence shows that consumption of coffee 
within the moderate range 3 to 5 cups/day or up to 400 mg/day caffeine is not associated with 
increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as CVD and cancer and premature death in healthy 
adults” (DGAC, 2015). Both of these assessments were issued after our SR was initiated, and the 
consistency in conclusions provides overall confidence in the original values developed by 
Health Canada (Nawrot et al., 2003) and assessed herein. EFSA also made additional 
conclusions, several of which address uncertainties described above. For example, with respect 
to the conditions under which caffeine is consumed within a day, EFSA concluded that single 
doses of caffeine of up to 200 mg do not give rise to safety concerns (200 mg was also the 
amount associated with lack of concern for pregnant and lactating women). The underlying data 
(Bull et al., 2015) addressed a larger scope than that evaluated herein (e.g., multiple exposure 
conditions, including coadministration with alcohol or p-synephrine or in combination with 
ingredients found in energy drinks, and different outcomes), although it included fewer studies to 
do so (n = 112) relative to the number of studies evaluated for this SR for fewer outcomes. It is 
our speculation that the complexity of trying to account for all of these factors and desire to 
provide a safe value for all populations likely help to explain the conservatism in the single dose 
designation.  
A key strength of this assessment is its approach: by utilizing a SR approach, we have been both 
rigorous and transparent in the identification and evaluation of data. In addition, the review was 
conducted by a multidisciplinary team of subject matter experts, including experts in 
epidemiology, clinical medicine, and SR. The evidence base was voluminous; conclusions were 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

128
developed following integration of results from 380 studies. In addition, this SR has a high level 
of transparency via the figures and tables herein, extensive materials in the AHRQ system, and 
PROSPERO registration of five protocols prior to the implementation of the review. Several 
challenges, however, were met in applying the SR approach to a broad array of outcomes and 
endpoints (which is a topic in itself) being addressed in the field, as the best practices for use of 
SR in the field of toxicology (versus medicine) are still being developed  (Stephens et al., 2016; 
Wikoff and Britt, 2016). Unlike other evidence-based toxicological assessments, this SR focused 
on a single evidence stream; given the volume of human data available, as well as strength of 
human data in developing public health guidance, it was determined that other evidence streams 
involving experimental laboratory studies (e.g., animal studies, mechanistic studies) would not 
be included. However, evaluation of such data may be useful in future endeavors that aim to very 
specifically characterize specific effects and, particularly, the underlying mode of action or 
thresholds in the dose-response relationship. In addition, this SR aids in addressing topics 
identified in the IOM workshop on caffeine (McGuire, 2014), including exploration of safe 
caffeine exposure levels and associated boundaries, as well as systematic data collection and 
analysis.  
With respect to further utilization of the data from this SR, it is important to emphasize that we 
did not set out to identify a new value for caffeine but instead to ascertain whether or not the 
heavily cited values used in Nawrot et al. (2003) remain acceptable 13 years after publication. If 
our objective had been to develop an independent value, a different approach would have been 
implemented. The process and data presented in this SR, however, provide the core elements to 
such an endeavor. These data comprehensively characterize the body of literature available, 
allowing for informed selection of candidate datasets upon which to base a protective value—
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
129
including the identification of critical endpoints as well as characterization of the quality and 
strength of evidence for each endpoint. These data also provide a foundation for future meta-
analyses that could better characterize the dose-response relationship for selected endpoint(s) 
(Eden et al., 2011; Moher et al., 2009). This approach would likely allow for better evaluation of 
data above the comparator; in this assessment, data are limited to exposure doses or ranges 
provided by the authors.  
Establishing regulatory boundaries is challenging for an ingredient like caffeine, and this process 
involves navigation of the spectrum from allowing the consumer to obtain desired effects 
(typically cognitive or performance related) to avoiding concerning and unwanted adverse 
events. Furthering the complexity, it is quite widely recognized that perceptions of caffeine’s 
effects and experiences with caffeine’s pharmacological impact can differ greatly between 
individuals. Although it is certainly important to understand sensitive subpopulations and unique 
cases since 85% of the public apparently seeks caffeine (Mitchell et al., 2014), helping to 
reassure what level of exposure is safe for the majority of healthy consumers can alleviate undue 
alarm and allow scientists to shift attention to more meaningful research areas. Since Health 
Canada’s work is so heavily and commonly referenced in nearly every discussion of caffeine 
safety, we believe there is value to the interested scientist, regulatory body, or even layperson in 
evaluating whether or not the benchmarks put forward by Health Canada remain acceptable in 
assuring a reasonable certainty of no harm nearly 13 years since they were developed. Numerous 
reviews have been written on caffeine and while they often focus on one major endpoint of 
interest; an approach is understandable and valuable, we believe that part of the reason the 
Health Canada value continues to be cited is that it more comprehensively takes into account 
caffeine’s potential effects on multiple outcomes. It has served as a reference value aimed at 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
130
reassuring the typical healthy individual consuming about 400 mg/day that he or she should not 
expect to experience alarming or unwanted effects.  
In conclusion, the results of this SR support the guidance values characterized over a decade ago 
by Health Canada and reinforce integrative assessments from other authoritative groups (EFSA, 
2015). Furthermore, the data evaluated herein represent the most advanced science (i.e., more 
up-to-date methodology than that in the body of evidence evaluated by Health Canada). 
Although there are exceptions related to specific endpoints, the evidence generally supports that 
consumption of up to 400 mg caffeine/day in healthy adults is not associated with overt, adverse 
cardiovascular, behavioral, reproductive, acute, or bone status effects. Evidence also supports 
that a daily consumption of up to 300 mg caffeine/day in healthy pregnant women is associated 
with a general lack of adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Recognizing that 
individuals may differ in their own level of sensitivity to caffeine, the Health Canada values were 
originally intended to provide guidance on safe levels of consumption to healthy consumers. The 
findings of the SR would further support the safety of standard consumption practices in the 
United States, as both mean and upper end estimated intakes (mean of 165 mg/day and 90th 
percentile of 395 mg/day, all ages) are below the comparator value evaluated herein. Findings of 
this assessment, however, highlight that as established previously—there is no “bright line,” as 
potential effects are dependent on many conditional factors; further, there is some limited 
evidence that self-regulation reduces consumption (Griffiths et al., 1986). With regard to child 
and adolescent populations, limited data were identified; however, based on the available studies 
reviewed, there is no evidence to suggest a need for a change from the recommendation of 2.5 
mg/kg caffeine/day. It should be noted that additional research would be valuable in this area, as 
well as in other areas identified as having insufficient information in this SR – a finding similar 
 MANUSCRIPT

131
to that of other investigators (e.g., Ruxton 2014). To that end, the results of this SR support a 
shift in caffeine research to focus on characterizing effects in sensitive populations and 
establishing better quantitative characterization of interindividual variability as well as 
subpopulations (e.g., unhealthy populations, those with preexisting conditions), conditions (e.g., 
coexposures), and outcomes (e.g., exacerbation of risk-taking behavior) that could render 
individuals to be at greater risk relative to healthy adults and pregnant women.

Insufficent data to develop conclusion 
 The SR of 14 studies provided evidence to evaluate potential impacts of the consumption of 400 mg 
caffeine/day on the bone and calcium outcome in healthy adults; these studies included assessment of 
the risk of fracture and fall, BMD and osteoporosis, and altered calcium homeostasis. When the weight 
of evidence was considered (See Section 3.1.2), the comparator, 400 mg/day, was found to be an 
acceptable intake that is not associated with significant concern regarding overt, adverse effects on 
bone or calcium endpoints, particularly under conditions of adequate calcium intake. Although effects 
were observed at exposures below the comparator they were often limited to physiological effects 
following acute exposure (altered calcium homeostasis), and subgroups in analyses of clinical endpoints, 
including those with low calcium intake. Such effects were generally of low magnitude, and/or were of 
overall low/negligible consequence to downstream events. Several studies also reported on a lack of 
effect on the clinical endpoints following chronic consumption below the comparator, as well as above 
the comparator. Based on the underlying study type (11 observational, 2 RCTs, 1 meta-analysis) that 
constitute this evidence base, there is a moderate level of confidence in the research, which supports 
this conclusion. Key limitations that precluded a higher level of confidence were the inability to fully 
accommodate for calcium intake, the high level of indirectness, as well as an uncertainty in exposure 
estimates.

In summary, the SR of 191 studies evaluated the potential for caffeine to be associated with adverse 
cardiovascular effects, including mortality, morbidity, blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, and heart 
rate variability (and others; see Supplementary File S2). When the weight of evidence was considered 
(See Section 3.2.2), with particular emphasis on level of adversity, 400 mg caffeine/day was found to be 
an acceptable intake which is not associated with significant concern regarding adverse cardiovascular 
effects in healthy adults. For clinical endpoints, some findings suggested that the comparator was too 
conservative; however, other data, particularly those for physiological endpoints, reported effects below 
the comparator. For such physiological endpoints (e.g., blood pressure), confidence in determining 
conclusions relative to the comparator was limited by the inability to ascertain the conditions and 
magnitude of change that would be considered adverse in a clinical or toxicological context. There is a 
moderate to high level of confidence (Table 1) in this evidence base.

experts.  Determinations were based on considerations for direction of findings, quality of data, level of 
adversity, and confidence in the body of evidence (including consistency, dose response, and magnitude 
of effect; Table 1). When developing outcome conclusions, clinical endpoints with a high level of 
adversity were given more weight than physiological endpoints .

In summary, the SR of 58 studies (55 observational; 3 RCTs) provided evidence to evaluate potential 
impacts of the consumption of 300 mg caffeine/day in pregnant women, or 400 mg/day in healthy 
adults, on reproductive and developmental effects. These studies included assessment of fecundability, 
fertility, male reproductive endpoints, spontaneous abortion, recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm 
birth and gestational age, fetal growth, birth defects, childhood cancers, and childhood behavior. When 
the weight of evidence was considered (See Section 3.4.2), an intake of 300 mg caffeine/day in pregnant 
women and 400 mg/day in healthy adults are generally without significant concern regarding overt 
adverse effects on fecundability, fertility, male reproductive endpoints, spontaneous abortion, recurrent 
miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth and gestational age, birth defects, and childhood behavior.  For 
some endpoints, including fetal growth, childhood cancers, isolated congenital malformations, evidence 
indicated that intake at the level of the comparator was too liberal; however, refined conclusions were 
difficult to determine given uncertainties in the evidence base, including low attrition rates, lack of 
ability to account for recall bias particularly for childhood cancers, lack of ability to fully accommodate 
the impact of the pregnancy signal, and lack of biological relevance of findings (referring primarily to 
fetal growth changes; the biological significance of such an effect is more robustly evaluated in studies 
evaluating SGA or IUGR, which, as a whole, did not show effects below the comparator). The relevance

The SR of 81 studies provided evidence to evaluate potential impacts of the consumption of 400 mg 
caffeine/day on the behavior outcome, including assessment of mood (comprising anxiety and other 
mood states), headache, sleep, withdrawal, and risk-taking behavior. When the weight of evidence was 
considered (See Section 3.3.2), the comparator, 400 mg caffeine/day, was found to be an acceptable 
intake that is not be associated with significant concern for adverse behavioral effects in adults.  
However, intake below the comparator may affect some sensitive individuals who are prone to anxiety 
or sleep disruption. Often, observed effects below the comparator (e.g., anxiety) were limited to 
subgroups or timing of dose (e.g., sleep), whereas others were complicated by consumer status (e.g., 
headache and fatigue).  For some endpoints (depression, headache, sleep [subjective], and 
anger/confusion there was largely a lack of effects reported, and in some cases, data suggested that 
intakes higher than the comparator were without effect. There is a moderate to high level of confidence 
in the body of evidence supporting this conclusion. Confidence was increased by the overall low risk of 
bias and low level of indirectness; although the variability introduced by sensitive subpopulations and 
consumer status were key limitations that precluded a higher level of confidence.

(Table 1)
Similar to the approach and conclusions of Health Canada (Nawrot et al. (2003), conclusions were 
developed using a weight of evidence assessment conducted by evidence analysts and subject matter 
experts.  Determinations were based on considerations for direction of findings, quality of data, level of 
adversity, and confidence in the body of evidence (including consistency, dose response, and magnitude 
of effect; Table 1). When developing outcome conclusions, clinical endpoints with a high level of 
adversity were given more weight than physiological endpoints .

The SR of 26 studies provided evidence to evaluate potential acute toxicity. Following a weight of 
evidence review (see Section 3.5.2), the comparators of 10 g for lethality and 400 mg/day or 2.5 
mg/kg/day for other acute effects, were determined to be acceptable for healthy adults and 
adolescents, respectively. There is very low to low confidence in this evidence base, due primarily to 
uncertainty in the estimates of exposure and to the high risk of bias. A higher level of confidence is also 
precluded by the inherent bias introduced by utilizing case reports (i.e., limitations to reporting of 
effects versus no effects).
Lethality: 10g for 
adults and 
adolescents  
Nonlethality: 400 
mg/day for adutls 
and 2.5 mg/kg-
day  for 
adolescents
No conclusion for 
pregnant women 
or children
evaluating SGA or IUGR, which, as a whole, did not show effects below the comparator). The relevance 
of smoking to the analyses in this data set was generally well recognized and, in most studies, the 
investigators attempted to control for such. There is a moderate level of confidence in the evidence base 
which supports this conclusion.

Highlights 
• Conducted systematic review of the potential adverse effects of caffeine consumption in 
healthy populations  
• Included evaluation of cardiovascular, behavioral, reproductive & developmental, bone & 
calcium, and acute effects  
• Evidence supported consumption of ≤400 mg/day in adults is not associated with overt, 
adverse effects 
• Intakes of ≤300 mg/day in pregnant women and ≤2.5 mg/kg-day in children and 
adolescents remain appropriate recommendations 
• Findings support shift in future research to unhealthy populations, sensitive populations 
and interindividual variability
