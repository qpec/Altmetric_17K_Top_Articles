IMPORTANCE Dabigatran and rivaroxaban are non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants approved for
stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). There are no randomized
head-to-head comparisons of these drugs for stroke, bleeding, or mortality outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To compare risks of thromboembolic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major
extracranial bleeding including major gastrointestinal bleeding, and mortality in patients with
nonvalvular AF who initiated dabigatran or rivaroxaban treatment for stroke prevention.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective new-user cohort study of 118 891 patients
with nonvalvular AF who were 65 years or older, enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare, and
who initiated treatment with dabigatran or rivaroxaban from November 4, 2011, through June
30, 2014. Differences in baseline characteristics were adjusted using stabilized inverse
probability of treatment weights based on propensity scores. The data analysis was
performed from May 7, 2015, through June 30, 2016.
EXPOSURES Dabigatran, 150 mg, twice daily; rivaroxaban, 20 mg, once daily.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary outcomes of
thromboembolic stroke, ICH, major extracranial bleeding including major gastrointestinal
bleeding, and mortality, with dabigatran as reference. Adjusted incidence rate differences
(AIRDs) were also estimated.
RESULTS A total of 52 240 dabigatran-treated and 66 651 rivaroxaban-treated patients (47%
female) contributed 15 524 and 20 199 person-years of on-treatment follow-up, respectively,
during which 2537 primary outcome events occurred. Rivaroxaban use was associated with a
statistically nonsignificant reduction in thromboembolic stroke (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65-1.01;
P = .07; AIRD = 1.8 fewer cases/1000 person-years), statistically significant increases in ICH
(HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.20-2.26; P = .002; AIRD = 2.3 excess cases/1000 person-years) and
major extracranial bleeding (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.32-1.67; P < .001; AIRD = 13.0 excess
cases/1000 person-years), including major gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.23-1.59; P < .001; AIRD = 9.4 excess cases/1000 person-years), and with a statistically
nonsignificant increase in mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00-1.32; P = .051; AIRD = 3.1 excess
cases/1000 person-years). In patients 75 years or older or with CHADS2 score greater than 2,
rivaroxaban use was associated with significantly increased mortality compared with
dabigatran use. The excess rate of ICH with rivaroxaban use exceeded its reduced rate of
thromboembolic stroke.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Treatment with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was associated
with statistically significant increases in ICH and major extracranial bleeding, including major
gastrointestinal bleeding, compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily.

W
arfarin sodium, a vitamin K antagonist, has been a
mainstay of therapy to reduce thromboembolic
stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF),1-3
but it substantially increases the risk of intracranial and ex-
tracranial hemorrhage3 and it can be difficult to maintain pa-
tients in the therapeutic range.4 Dabigatran etexilate me-
sylate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban, a factor
Xa inhibitor, are non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagu-
lants (NOACs), which are simpler to dose than warfarin and do
not require therapeutic monitoring.5,6 In the Randomized
EvaluationofLong-TermAnticoagulationTherapy(RE-LY)trial,
dabigatran treatment was superior to warfarin treatment for
reduction of stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in pa-
tients with nonvalvular AF but was inferior for major gastro-
intestinal bleeding, in which risk was increased.7 In the Riva-
roxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared
with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Em-
bolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF), rivaroxaban
treatment was noninferior to warfarin treatment for preven-
tion of stroke or systemic embolization.8 Intracranial and fa-
tal bleeding events were reduced while major gastrointesti-
nal bleeding was increased in the rivaroxaban arm.
Using data from RE-LY and ROCKET-AF, an indirect com-
parisonreportedthatstrokeandsystemicembolizationriskand
hemorrhagic stroke risk were significantly reduced with dabi-
gatranusecomparedwithrivaroxabanuse.9However,thisanaly-
sisdidnotcontrolfordifferencesinbaselineriskoffuturestroke
or in the quality of warfarin anticoagulation between trials.9,10
Another indirect comparison, restricted to the subset of pa-
tients from these trials at high risk of future stroke, found a sta-
tistically nonsignificant reduction in stroke or systemic embo-
lizationriskwithdabigatrantreatment.10Thequestionremains
unanswered whether these NOACs are therapeutically similar
orwhetherclinicallyimportantdifferencesexistthatmightlead
prescribers and patients to prefer one over the other.
Giventhat80%ofpatientswithAFare65yearsorolder,11,12
we studied elderly Medicare beneficiaries with nonvalvular AF
who initiated therapy with dabigatran or rivaroxaban and di-
rectly compared their risks of stroke, bleeding, and death. Both
NOACs are available in the United States at 2 dosage levels for
use in patients with nonvalvular AF, a lower dose for patients
with impaired renal function and a standard dose for all other
patients.5,6 We compared patients initiating treatment with
standard doses of dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) and rivar-
oxaban (20 mg once daily).
Methods
Study Population
Medicare provides health insurance coverage to persons aged
65 years and older and those younger than 65 years who have
end-stage kidney disease or are disabled.13,14 This study was
restricted to elderly beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service
Medicare Part A (hospitalization), Part B (outpatient medical
care),andPartD(prescriptiondrugs)becauseclaimsfromthese
sources were necessary for research purposes. Patients en-
rolled in Medicare Advantage (Part C), which provides care
through private insurance companies, were not included be-
cause claims for medical encounters and hospitalizations were
not reliably captured by Medicare during the study period.
A new-user cohort design was used to compare patients
initiating dabigatran or rivaroxaban at standard doses for treat-
ment of nonvalvular AF.15 We identified all patients with any
inpatient or outpatient diagnoses of AF or atrial flutter, based
on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9),coding,whofilledtheirfirstprescriptionforeitherdrug
from November 4, 2011, when rivaroxaban was approved for
AF in the United States, through June 30, 2014. Patients were
excluded if they had less than 6 months of enrollment in Medi-
care Parts A, B, and D, were younger than 65 years, had re-
ceived prior treatment with warfarin or any NOAC, resided in
a skilled nursing facility or nursing home, or were receiving
hospice care on the date of their cohort-qualifying prescrip-
tion (index date). Patients with a hospitalization extending be-
yond the index date were also excluded, as were kidney trans-
plantrecipientsandpatientsundergoingdialysis.Additionally,
we excluded patients with diagnoses indicating a potential al-
ternative indication for anticoagulation in the 6 months pre-
ceding study entry (mitral valve disease, heart valve repair or
replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or
joint replacement). Because our purpose was to directly com-
paredabigatranandrivaroxaban,wedidnotincludeawarfarin-
treated cohort.
This study was approved by the Research in Human Sub-
jects Committee of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-
search. Informed consent was not required due to the retro-
spective nature of the study.
Baseline Covariates
During the 6 months preceding cohort entry, Medicare claims
dataonchronicmedicalconditions,cardiovasculardisease,risk
factors for cardiovascular, stroke, and bleeding events, and
health care utilization were collected for each patient, as were
data on prescriptions for medications used for treatment of
these disorders, as well as potentially interacting medica-
tions that could alter dabigatran or rivaroxaban pharmacoki-
netics. We also calculated the CHADS2 score,16 which pre-
dicts stroke risk in patients with AF and was used in RE-LY and
Key Points
Question How does rivaroxaban compare with dabigatran for
stroke, bleeding, and mortality risks in patients with atrial
fibrillation?
Findings In a new-user cohort study of 118 891 patients,
rivaroxaban treatment was associated with significantly increased
intracranial hemorrhage and major extracranial bleeding, including
major gastrointestinal bleeding, and nonsignificantly reduced risk
of thromboembolic stroke and increased risk of mortality. The
absolute increase in intracranial hemorrhage with rivaroxaban
treatment exceeded its reduced rate of thromboembolic stroke.
Meaning In this observational study, rivaroxaban use was
associated with increased intracranial and major extracranial
bleeding events compared with dabigatran use.

ROCKET-AF,7,8 and the HAS-BLED score,17 which predicts
bleeding risk in patients with AF treated with warfarin.
Control for Confounding
To adjust for potential confounding due to baseline imbal-
ances in study covariates while preserving sample size, we
used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based
on the propensity score.18-22 With this method, the propensity
score (predicted probability of initiating dabigatran treatment
given baseline characteristics) was used to generate patient-
specific stabilized weights that control for covariate im-
balances.20,21 Covariate balance between the weighted co-
horts was assessed using standardized mean differences.22-24
A standardized difference of 0.1 or less indicates a negligible
difference between groups.22-24 The distributions of propen-
sity scores and stabilized weights were inspected for outliers.
Cohort Follow-up
Follow-up began on the day after cohort entry and continued
until disenrollment from Medicare, a gap in anticoagulant days
of supply exceeding 3 days, a prescription fill for a different an-
ticoagulant, kidney transplantation or initiation of dialysis, ad-
mission to a skilled nursing facility or nursing home, transfer
tohospicecare,endofthestudyperiod,oroccurrenceofastudy
outcome, whichever came first. We chose a 3-day gap allow-
ance because of the short half-lives of dabigatran (12-17 hours)
and rivaroxaban (11-13 hours in the elderly) and our desire to
increase the likelihood that patients included in analyses were
therapeutically anticoagulated.5,6 We censored for admission
to a skilled nursing facility or nursing home due to concerns
about incomplete capture of outcomes in these settings, and
for transfer to hospice care because most deaths in these pa-
tients were expected and therefore unlikely to be due to an
acute, anticoagulant-associated event.
Study Outcomes
Primary outcomes were thromboembolic stroke, ICH, major
extracranial bleeding events, including major gastrointesti-
nal bleeding, and mortality. Secondary outcomes were all hos-
pitalizedextracranialbleedingeventsandacutemyocardialin-
farction. Outcomes were defined using previously validated
algorithms based on ICD-9 diagnosis codes. These algorithms
have reported positive predictive values ranging from 86% to
97% (eTable 1 in the Supplement).25-35 Hospital records were
not obtained to independently validate these outcomes. Ma-
jor extracranial bleeding was defined as a fatal bleeding event,
a hospitalized bleeding event requiring transfusion, or hospi-
talization with hemorrhage into an extracranial critical site (ie,
intraspinal, intraarticular, intraocular, pericardial, retroperi-
toneal,orintramuscularwithcompartmentsyndrome).8,9This
definition differed from that in RE-LY and ROCKET-AF be-
cause we lacked data to document a decrease in hemoglobin
concentration of at least 2 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter,
multiply by 10.0) or the number of units transfused.36 Mor-
tality was ascertained by linkage to Social Security files, which
providethedate,butnotcause,ofdeathandcapturemorethan
95% of deaths for persons 65 years or older in the United
States.37 Our death outcome included deaths occurring as the
first study outcome or within 30 days after hospitalization for
another primary outcome event.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were based on IPTW-adjusted cohorts and there-
fore accounted for potential confounding by baseline factors.
Weighted Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence plots were gen-
erated to characterize risk over time. Weighted Cox propor-
tional hazards regression with robust estimation was used to
estimate time-to-event in rivaroxaban compared with dabi-
gatran (reference) cohorts. Adjusted incidence rate differ-
ences were estimated using weighted event counts and fol-
low-up time within cohorts. Statistical significance was
determined using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 2-tailed
P values (P ≤ .05). For all outcomes except mortality, the 30-
day case fatality rate, defined as the number of deaths within
30 days of outcome occurrence divided by the total number
of patients with that outcome, was determined.
Prespecifiedsubgroupanalyseswereperformedforallout-
comes in categories defined by age, sex, hospitalization within
the prior 30 days, concomitant use of antiplatelet agents,
chronic kidney disease, and CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores. In
a secondary analysis, Cox models were generated to examine
risk during predefined intervals of time during therapy be-
cause bleeding risks may be greatest during the first 3 months
after anticoagulant initiation.29,38 We performed a number of
sensitivity analyses. To assess whether the main analyses were
affected by misclassification of exposed time, we restricted
analysis to patients with at least 2 prescription fills of a study
drug, and increased the gap allowance between anticoagu-
lant prescriptions from 3 to 14 days. We repeated the main
analysis using multivariable Cox regression, which included
all covariates used in the weighted analysis. In post hoc sen-
sitivity analyses, the CHA2DS2-VASc was substituted for the
CHADS2 score39; we no longer censored for initiation of dialy-
sis or kidney transplantation, or admission to a nursing home,
skillednursingfacility,orhospice;andweadjustedforthecom-
peting risks of death using the subdistribution of hazards
approach.40
Analyses were performed using R 3.2.0 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and SAS v. 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
A total of 52 240 dabigatran and 66 651 rivaroxaban initiators
contributed 15 524 and 20 199 person-years of on-treatment
follow-up (mean [range] duration, 108 [0-969] and 111 [0-
923] days), respectively. Before adjustment, there were mi-
nor differences in income status, geographic residence, emer-
gency department visits in the prior 30 days, and prior use of
injectable anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and digoxin.
There were more substantial differences in prescriber spe-
cialty, with greater prescribing of rivaroxaban by cardiolo-
gists and less prescribing by family practitioners (Table 1 and
eTable 2 in the Supplement). After IPTW adjustment, the co-
horts were well balanced across all covariates.

During follow-up, there were 2537 primary outcome
events including 306 thromboembolic strokes, 176 intracra-
nial bleeding events, 1209 major extracranial bleeding events
of which 1018 (84.2%) were gastrointestinal, and 846 deaths
(724 as the first outcome and 122 within 30 days of another
primary outcome event). Cumulative incidence plots showed
early separation of event rates with continued divergence
throughout follow-up for ICH, major gastrointestinal bleed-
ing, and mortality, but convergence of event rates for throm-
boembolic stroke after day 240 (Figure 1). Rivaroxaban use
was associated with a statistically nonsignificant decrease in

myocardial infarction risk between drugs. Adjusted inci-
dence rate differences were 1.8 fewer cases of thromboem-
bolic stroke, 2.3 excess cases of ICH, 13.0 excess cases of
major extracranial bleeding including 9.4 excess cases of
major gastrointestinal bleeding, and 3.1 excess deaths per
1000 person-years with rivaroxaban treatment. The rate dif-
ferences for thromboembolic stroke and mortality were not
statistically significant. Of note, the increased rate of ICH
with rivaroxaban treatment exceeded its decreased rate of
thromboembolic stroke. The 30-day case fatality rates were
9.2% (thromboembolic stroke), 31.8% (ICH), 3.1% (major
extracranial bleeding), 3.3% (major gastrointestinal bleed-
ing), 2.7% (all hospitalized extracranial bleeding), and 9.7%
(acute myocardial infarction), with little difference between
cohorts.
Hazard ratios were generally consistent among sub-
groups with a few exceptions (Figure 2). For major gastroin-
testinal bleeding, the increased risk with rivaroxaban treat-
ment diminished with increasing age, and for mortality,
rivaroxaban risk was significantly increased in patients aged
75 years and older and in those with a CHADS2 score greater
than 2 (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The secondary analysis
found no differences over time for any of the study outcomes
exceptthromboembolicstroke,forwhichrivaroxabanriskmay
have been decreased during the first 90 days of use but not
thereafter(HR,0.71;95%CI,0.55-0.93vsHR,1.14;95%CI,0.74-
1.75; P for interaction = .07) (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Sen-
sitivity analyses yielded results similar to the main analysis
(eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In a direct comparison of patients with nonvalvular AF treated
with standard doses of dabigatran or rivaroxaban, the risks of
ICH and major extracranial bleeding, including major gastro-
intestinal bleeding, were significantly increased in patients
treated with rivaroxaban. Although the risk of mortality was
nonsignificantly increased with rivaroxaban across all age
groups in the main analysis, it was significantly increased in
patients aged 75 years or older or with CHADS2 greater than 2,
compared with dabigatran treatment. These latter results
must be interpreted cautiously given that we examined mul-
tiple subgroups. Also, the net increase in ICH, the outcome
with the highest case fatality rate, exceeded the net reduction
in thromboembolic stroke for rivaroxaban treatment. Of note,
in 2014, rivaroxaban was used 2 to 3 times more often than
dabigatran in US patients with AF,41 perhaps partly because of
prescriber misperceptions about bleeding risks with dabiga-
tran, arising from US Food and Drug Administration receipt of
a large number of postmarketing case reports following its
approval.42 Ironically, we found substantially higher bleeding
risks with use of rivaroxaban than dabigatran. Our results are
consistent with a recently published small study from Den-
mark that reported no difference in stroke risk but increased
bleeding and mortality risks with rivaroxaban 20 mg once
daily compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily in patients
with AF.43
Our results differ from those based on indirect compari-
sons of clinical trials, which suggested that stroke risk might
be higher with rivaroxaban use but with no difference in mor-
tality or bleeding risks between the 2 NOACs.9,10 This high-
lights the importance of head-to-head studies when evaluat-
ing comparative effectiveness of competing therapies. Indirect
comparisons can be unreliable.44 For example, rivaroxaban-
treatedpatientsinROCKET-AFwereolderandhadhigherbase-
line CHADS2 scores than dabigatran-treated patients in RE-LY
while time in therapeutic range for warfarin-treated patients
in RE-LY was greater than in ROCKET-AF.9,10,44 These differ-
ences, and perhaps others not measured, could confound an
indirect comparison. Whereas a randomized direct compari-
son between dabigatran and rivaroxaban would be optimal,
such a study is unlikely to be undertaken by the manufac-
turer of either product.
Our findings suggest that standard-dose rivaroxaban pro-
duced a greater anticoagulant effect than standard-dose dabi-
gatran. While plasma half-lives of dabigatran and rivaroxa-
banareeachapproximately12hours,dabigatranisdosedtwice
daily and rivaroxaban only once daily.5,6 Once-daily dosing of
rivaroxaban would be expected to achieve higher peak and
lower trough serum concentrations than twice-daily admin-
istration of the same total daily dose.45 Reduction of the once-
daily dose or adoption of a twice-daily regimen might reduce
the excess bleeding and subgroup mortality risks that we ob-
served. However, effects of such dose adjustment on both
thrombotic and bleeding events would need to be evaluated
through clinical testing. It is also possible that our results arose
because some patients taking dabigatran did so only once daily
rather than twice daily, leading to dabigatran-treated pa-
tients being inadequately anticoagulated. We believe that this
is unlikely for 2 reasons. In a previous study of patients with
AF initiating warfarin or standard-dose dabigatran treat-
ment, using the same Medicare database and outcome defi-
nitions as in this study, results similar to those of the RE-LY
trial were obtained, suggesting that adherence to the twice-
daily dabigatran regimen by Medicare beneficiaries was com-
parabletothatofpatientsinRE-LY.38Also,oursensitivityanaly-
sis restricted to patients filling 2 or more NOAC prescriptions
yielded results similar to the primary analysis. This analysis
included only dabigatran-treated patients who filled their sec-
ond prescription by the date expected had they been taking it
twice daily. Patients taking dabigatran once daily would not
be expected to fill their second prescription by this date be-
cause they would still have a large remaining medication sup-
ply. Finally, the lower dose of dabigatran is recommended for
patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 15 to 30 mL/min/
1.73 m2, whereas for rivaroxaban, it is a broader range of 15 to
50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (to convert to milliliters per second per
square meter, multiply by 0.0167).5,6 In our standard-dose
analysis, we excluded patients treated with the lower dose. We
cannot exclude the possibility that a higher proportion of ri-
varoxaban-treatedpatientswithrenalimpairmentweretreated
off-label with the standard dose because of the broader CrCl
range guiding rivaroxaban dosing. If this occurred, a greater
anticoagulanteffectwithrivaroxabanmightbeobservedinour
data. Medicare claims do not capture CrCl or other laboratory

results so we cannot definitively evaluate this. With a broader
CrCl range, we would expect a higher proportion of rivaroxa-
ban than dabigatran users to be treated with the lower dose,
which was present in our data, with 19.6% of dabigatran- and
26.8% of rivaroxaban-treated patients treated with the renal
dose (eTable 7 in the Supplement).
This study had several limitations. The mean duration of
on-treatment follow-up was less than 4 months, thereby re-
ducing sample size at longer durations of use. Other studies
of NOAC safety using other US databases have had mean fol-
low-up shorter than 6 months, indicating a limited capacity
to study longer-term risks.46-48 Despite this, we had a larger
number of patients still receiving therapy at 6 or 8 months than
the number who started NOAC therapy in these and other
studies.43,46-49 This study was observational and may be sub-
jecttoresidualconfoundingbyunmeasuredfactors.Thiscould
lead to biased estimates of risk. Also, our study was restricted
to patients aged 65 years or older, the age group accounting
for 80% of patients with AF. The comparative effects of dabi-
gatranandrivaroxabantreatmentcouldbedifferentinyounger
populations. Finally, our study examined warfarin-naive first-
time users of dabigatran or rivaroxaban for stroke prevention
in AF. Results could differ in patients switching from warfa-
rin to a NOAC.
Conclusions
In this large direct comparison of patients with AF treated with
dabigatranorrivaroxaban,rivaroxabanusewasassociatedwith
statisticallysignificantincreasesintheriskofICHandmajorex-
tracranial bleeding, including major gastrointestinal bleeding,
and possibly with increased mortality in older patients or those
with higher baseline risk of stroke. The greater anticoagulant
effect observed with rivaroxaban treatment may be due to the
higher dose required for once-daily dosing. A contribution to
this effect by off-label use of standard-dose rivaroxaban in pa-
tients with impaired renal function cannot be excluded.
