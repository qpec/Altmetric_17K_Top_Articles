T
he effects of percutaneous catheter-based renal denerva-
tion (RDN) as new therapy for resistant hypertension have 
been evaluated several times in the past years.1–8 First studies 
suggested large effects on blood pressure (BP). However, in 
the first sham-controlled randomized trial, no difference in 
treated versus controlled participants was found.2 Subgroup 
analyses of RDN studies have identified different factors of 
relevance in determining the overall effect of the intervention 
on BP.9–11 Of particular interest is medication adherence. To 
quantify the effect of the addition of RDN to medical treat-
ment, it is imperative that antihypertensive medical treat-
ment remains unchanged. Recent small studies, using urine 
or blood samples to detect medication, suggested that adher-
ence is particularly poor in presumed resistant hypertensive 
participants.12–14
The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was 
designed to assess the efficacy of RDN in resistant hyperten-
sion participants, the primary end point being daytime systolic 
ambulatory BP (ABPM) at 6 months after RDN. In addition, 
we explored the effect of adherence on the study outcomes.
Methods
Study Design and Population
The rationale and design of SYMPATHY have been described previ-
ously.15 Briefly, SYMPATHY is a multicenter RCT in 14 centers in 
the Netherlands. For this trial, a system of conditional reimbursement 
was available for 4 years (2013–2016), indicating that the interven-
tion was covered by the healthcare insurance, only when patients 
participated in SYMPATHY. The consequence was that SYMPATHY 
findings were used by National Health Care Institute to advise the 
Abstract—Randomized trials of catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) as therapy for resistant hypertension showed 
conflicting results in blood pressure (BP) lowering effect. Adherence to medication is modest in this patient group and 
may importantly drive these conflicting results. SYMPATHY is a prospective open label multicenter trial in Dutch patients 
with resistant hypertension. Primary outcome was change in daytime systolic ambulatory BP at 6 months. Patients were 
randomly assigned to RDN on top of usual care. Adherence to BP lowering drugs was assessed at baseline and follow-up, 
using blood samples drawn synchronously with BP measurements. Patients and physicians were unaware of the adherence 
assessment. Primary analyses showed a mean difference between RDN (n=95) and control (n=44) in changes in daytime 
systolic ambulatory BP after 6 months of 2.0 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −6.1 to 10.2 mm Hg) in favor of control. 
In 80% of patients, fewer medications were detected than prescribed and adherence changed during follow-up in 31%. In 
those with stable adherence during follow-up, mean difference between RDN and control for daytime systolic ambulatory 
BP was −3.3 mm Hg (−13.7 to 7.2 mm Hg) in favor of RDN. RDN as therapy for resistant hypertension was not superior 
to usual care. Objective assessment of medication use shows that medication adherence is extremely poor, when patients 
are unaware of monitoring. Changes over time in adherence are common and affect treatment estimates considerably. 
Objective measurement of medication adherence during follow-up is strongly recommended in randomized trials.

government at the end of 2016 whether RDN should be part of the 
standard reimbursement package of the Dutch healthcare insur-
ances (https://english.zorginstituutnederland.nl/publications/reports/ 
2012/04/06/conditional-reimbursement-of-health-care). Because we 
had to deliver the report on the SYMPATHY findings to the National 
Health Care Institute no later than August 1, 2016, participants had to 
be included before January 1, 2016.
 In SYMPATHY adults were included with resistant hypertension, 
defined as an average daytime systolic ABPM measurement ≥135 
mm Hg, despite use ≥3 BP lowering agents or with documented in-
tolerance for ≥2 BP lowering agents. Participating physicians were 
advised to exclude white coat hypertension, secondary causes of 
hypertension, and anatomic abnormalities that would make RDN 
nonfeasible, using a standardized protocol.16 Randomization was 
performed in a 2:1 ratio to receive either RDN on top of usual care 
or usual care alone using a web-based computerized approach, with 
stratification by hospital and estimated glomerular filtration rate (20–
60 and >60 mL min−1 1.73 m−2).15
Ethics approval was obtained at the University Medical Center 
Utrecht (No. 12/540). All subjects gave informed consent. The trial 
was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration 
of Helsinki and Title 45, US Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, 
Protection of Human Subjects, Revised November 13, 2001, effective 
December 13, 2001.
Outcome Assessment
The primary outcome was change in daytime systolic ABPM 6 
months after RDN or inclusion into the study (control group). 
Secondary outcomes were change in office systolic BP (SBP), pre-
scribed BP lowering drugs, and change in kidney function. Other 
outcomes were periprocedural complications. ABPM monitoring was 
performed noninvasively, with readings every 30 minutes during day-
time and every 60 minutes during nighttime and was considered valid 
when ≥70% of the recordings were successful. Office BP was taken 
using an automatic device, in sitting position after 10 minutes of rest, 
twice at both arms using an appropriate cuff size. The mean was used 
as office BP. Both ABPM and office BP were measured with recom-
mended devices according to the European Society Hypertension/
European Society of Cardiology guidelines.17 Blood was sampled on 
the same day as BP was assessed. At study visits, the use of all medi-
cation was queried. BP lowering agents were classified according to 
the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system of the 
World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics. 
We calculated the defined daily dose of BP lowering agents per par-
ticipant per visit. The intention was to unchange baseline BP low-
ering medication till the 6-month visit (primary end point). In case 
adjustments in medication were necessary, these were made accord-
ing to a predefined protocol (online-only Data Supplement).15
Important Adjustments During the Course of the 
Trial
In January 2014, we added participants with documented intoler-
ance to ≥2 BP lowering agents. These participants represent a sizable 
group of difficult to treat hypertensive patients, for whom RDN could 
be beneficial as well. Second, from October 2014, National Health 
Care Institute allowed conditional reimbursement when participants 
were treated with the EnligHTN Ablation catheter (St Jude Medical, 
St Paul, MN).15,18 Choice of catheter was made by the interventionist.
During the course of the trial, it became increasingly clear that 
the objective assessment of medication adherence is of utmost im-
portance based on reports suggesting poor adherence in this class of 
participants.12–14 We decided to use stored samples for drug level mea-
surements. Of relevance, participants and attending physicians were 
unaware of the adherence assessments.
The original sample size estimation was set at 300 randomized 
participants. However, after SYMPLICITY-HTN-3, inclusion slowed 
dramatically. DENERHTN provided data to assume that a study size 
of 100 to 150 participants could be sufficient.1 We estimated that 
such a number could be feasible by January 1, 2016. We expected 
a difference of 5 mm Hg in SBP (with SD of 10 mm Hg) between 
the RDN and control group. Our power would be between 80% and 
90% with a 2-side α of 0.05. After consultation with the data safety 
monitoring board, we decided to continue the study. All described 
adjustments were approved by the Ethical Committee of University 
Medical Center Utrecht.
Adherence Measurements
Liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry 
was used to screen BP lowering drugs. This technique has proved 
to be reliable, accurate, and precise.19 The acquired mass spectra 
were compared with an in-house library (compound library and tan-
dem mass spectrometry mass spectral library) built with automated 
screening software (TOD ID, Thermo Fisher Scientific) which con-
tained the mass/charge of the precursor ion, retention time, product 
ions, and the entire tandem mass spectrometry spectra of 40 com-
pounds, including metabolites covering over 95% of all BP lower-
ing drugs registered in The Netherlands. Identification was achieved 
by comparing full tandem mass spectrometry spectra and mass/
charge of precursor ion with the confirmation by the second selected 
reaction monitoring transitions. Using the developed method, the 
identification results from spiked serum samples within therapeutic 
concentration ranges indicated 95% sensitivity and 91% specificity.
Participants were categorized into adherent (81%–100% match 
prescribed versus measured), poorly adherent (1%–80% match pre-
scribed versus measured), and completely nonadherent (0% match 
prescribed versus measured).20
Intervention
Usual care was based on the guidelines of the European Society 
Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology.17 The RDN procedure 
was performed by an interventional radiologist or cardiologist.
Data Analyses
Primary efficacy analysis was based on the (modified) intention-to-
treat population, including all participants randomized with avail-
able BP data ≥1 follow-up visit. The primary analysis, that is, mean 
of change in daytime systolic ABPM between treatment arms was 
based on t test. All other analyses were performed using either t tests 
(continuous variables [mean of change]) or χ2 test for dichotomous 
variables. Linear regression models were used to study whether treat-
ment effects differed across predefined subgroups, using multiplica-
tive interaction terms (treatment group×subgroup). Linear regression 
models with adjustments for lifestyle changes and for changes in 
prescribed and detected medication were run to study the effects of 
these factors on the observed change in the daytime ABPM and in 
office systolic pressure. A 2-sided 0.05 level of significance is used. 
Statistical analyses were done using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp, 
Armonk, NY).
Meta-Analysis
To place the SYMPATHY results in perspective of other RDN RCT 
results, we performed a systematic meta-analysis (online-only Data 
Supplement).
Results
From May 23, 2013 until January 1, 2016, 139 participants 
were randomized, 95 to RDN and 44 to usual care. After ran-
domization, 4 participants declined RDN. One participant, 
randomized to the usual care group, received RDN within the 
first 6 months. Before the first 6-month visit, 8 participants 
(5 RDN) withdrew their participation for follow-up mea-
surements (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics are shown in 
Table 1. Mean daytime systolic ABPM was 160 mm Hg (SD 
17 mm Hg), and daytime diastolic ABPM was 93 mm Hg (15 
mm Hg). Mean office BP was 169 (25)/96 (16) mm Hg. In 
60 participants, the Symplicity catheter was used and in 31

the EnligHTN Ablation catheter. Mean number of ablations 
was 15 (7).
Effect of RDN on BP
Six-month data on daytime ABPM were available for 124 
participants (Figure 1). Overall, BP levels declined sig-
nificantly (Table 2). Mean differences between groups in 
changes in daytime systolic ABPM after 6 months were 2.0 
mm Hg (−6.1 to 10.2 mm Hg), in 24-hour systolic ABPM 
1.0 mm Hg (−7.1 to 9.1 mm Hg), and in office SBP −8.2 
mm Hg (−17.1 to 0.7 mm Hg). The findings were the same 
when using a complete case analysis approach (Table S1 
in the online-only Data Supplement) or sensitivity analy-
sis for patients with true resistant hypertension, defined as 
the use ≥3 classes of BP lowering drugs (data not shown). 
Our meta-analysis (including 984 subjects from 7 stud-
ies) showed no significant benefit of RDN compared with 
usual care alone for daytime systolic ABPM (−1.60 mm Hg 
[−4.32 to 1.11 mm Hg]).
Adverse Events
We observed 17 periprocedural complications, including 4 
vascular, 8 bleeding, and 5 other (mild) complications (Table 
S2). All participants recovered without sequelae. Kidney 
function declined by 1.5 (−3.1 to 0.1) mL min−1 1.73 m−2 at 6 
months, with no difference between groups. During 6-month 
follow-up, 36 self-reported, unadjudicated serious adverse 
events were registered: 24 (26%) in the intervention group and 
12 (27%) in the usual care group (Table S3).
Subgroup Analyses
Predefined subgroup analysis showed no statistically sig-
nificant interaction between kidney function or baseline BP 
and RDN effects on BP. None of several post hoc subgroup 
analyses (sex, body mass index, previous cardiovascular his-
tory, smoking, urinary sodium excretion, size of the hospital 
(large centers/small centers), baseline use of spironolactone, 
and catheter type) reached statistical significance.
Medication Adherence at Baseline and Follow-Up
Prescribed medication did not differ significantly between 
treatment groups at 6 months and increased in both groups 
over time (Table 3; Table S4). Information on adherence 
was available for 98 and 83 participants at baseline and at 
follow-up, respectively (78 pairs). At both study time points, 
adherence was poor: 80% were either poorly adherent or com-
pletely nonadherent. In 54 (29 in RDN group) participants, 
adherence remained stable. The adherence category changed 
(eg, from poorly adherent to completely nonadherent) in 31% 
of the participants (n=24). There was no significant difference 
in change in adherence between treatment arms (Table 3).
Medication Adherence and BP
Baseline and 6-month daytime systolic ABPM were the highest 
in participants completely nonadherent in an analysis restricted 
to the 78 participants with adherence measurements at baseline 
and at follow-up (Table S5). When medication adherence was 
the same at baseline and follow-up, daytime systolic ABPM 
was 3.3 mm Hg (−13.7 to 7.2 mm Hg) lower in favor of the 
RDN group (Figure 2). The same trend was seen for 24-hour 
systolic ABPM (−4.7 mm Hg [−15.3 to 5.8 mm Hg]) and office 
SBP (−14.0 mm Hg [−25.7 to −2.4 mm Hg]; P=0.422 for the 
interaction term). Baseline characteristics did not differ sig-
nificantly between the intervention and control group in this 
selected population (Table S6). In particular, no difference was 
found in factors that potentially drive a larger RDN effect.
Discussion
This is the second largest RCT studying the effect of RDN 
on BP in participants defined as treatment-resistant hyperten-
sives. Six months after RDN, no significant reduction in day-
time or 24-hour systolic ABPM was observed compared with 
usual care alone.
Effect of RDN on office SBP was of borderline signifi-
cance. Results are in line with most of the other trials.1–3,5,6,8 
Our systematic review showed that the pooled effect of RDN 
on BP is most pronounced for office SBP (−5.4 mm Hg; Figure 
S2), yet, not statistically significant (P=0.27).

The possible reasons of the variability in the effects on 
BP between participants and between studies have been exten-
sively discussed over recent years.9,11,21 Relevant factors could 
be related to the device, the procedure itself, and participant 
characteristics. In this respect, medication adherence is of par-
ticular relevance because recent studies suggested poor adher-
ence in this type of participants.12–14,22–24 To our knowledge, 
we are the first trial on RDN to objectively assess medica-
tion adherence changes during the study. Strong features of 
our study are that blood samples were taken on the day of the 
ABPM and the fact that both participants and treating physi-
cians were unaware of the assessments, resulting in an accurate 
representation of the every-day reality. Questionnaires used in 
trials on RDN are likely to overestimate adherence.1,2,4,6 With 
a direct adherence assessment, we confirm that BP medication 
adherence is very low at baseline and at follow-up. This find-
ing is in line with the single direct adherence measurements 
in the PRAGUE trial (at screening) and DENERHTN trial 
(at 6-month follow-up).7,22 In addition, BP was higher in par-
ticipants with poor adherence (Table S5). Therefore, our data 
support the notion that poor medication adherence contributes 
to the condition of apparent resistant hypertension.
A second important aspect is that in about one third of the 
participants adherence to BP lowering drugs either increased 
or decreased during follow-up. There was a trend toward more 
detected BP lowering pills at follow-up, more pronounced 
in the control group than in the RDN group. This may be 
because of the more intensive follow-up during the trial and 
the absence of blinding for the intervention (no sham proce-
dure). The large percentage of change, with either decrease 
or increase in medication use, makes it virtually impossible 
to quantify the effect of the addition of RDN to medical 
treatment. This is especially the case when, as in our study, 
changes occur without the treating physicians knowing it. In 
those patients with the same number of medication at baseline 
and at follow-up, all BP measurements suggested a greater, 
albeit not statistically significant, decrease in the RDN arm. 
Figure 2 clearly suggests that the overall direction of the effect 
on BP considerably changed when taking medication adher-
ence into account. In none of the previous RCTs in the RDN 
field, was adherence quantified in both arms at both baseline 
and follow-up. It could be that in the other trials, adherence 
was better than in this study, but it seems appropriate to con-
clude that poor adherence and changes in adherence were 
probably major factors of concern.
Our results may have considerable societal impact. These 
patients use healthcare facilities by (frequently) visiting phy-
sicians, by collecting medication from the pharmacy, without 
using it, meanwhile staying at increased cardiovascular risk. 
Although the relation between hypertension and increased 
cardiovascular risk is well established, some participants feel 
great resistance for prolonged pharmacological therapy. The 
reasons are likely complex and include the fact that hyperten-
sion is usually free of symptoms and that participants expe-
rience side effects of medication. This triggers 2 lines of 
thinking. First, there is great need to more extensively focus on 
interventions that potentially improve medication adherence. 
Indeed, in DENERHTN, in which specific efforts were under-
taken to improve medication use, full adherence was found in 
half of the study population,22 which is much better than the 
20% found in this study, but still far from perfect. Alternatively, 
society could accept that a certain percentage of hypertensive

participants are not able or willing to use medical treatment 
for whatever (set of) reason(s). For such participants, alterna-
tive approaches, including device-related treatment strategies, 
could be considered as options worth exploration.
An important limitation of our trial is probably that par-
ticipants were not blinded to the intervention (no sham pro-
cedure). We tried to offset this by blinded assessment of the 
primary outcome, assessment of lifestyle changes that may 
affect BP for adjustment (salt intake and weight change), and 
objective measurements of (change in) medication adher-
ence for use in the statistical analyses of the results. Second, 
although we had a mix of patients (resistant and intolerant), it 
is unlikely that this affects our findings because our sensitiv-
ity analysis revealed no difference in effect when taken the 
resistant group separately. Another potential limitation might 
be the use of 2 different devices. This is only an issue when the 
2 devices differ in their BP lowering effect, of which no evi-
dence is available, yet. Further, not all patients were on diuret-
ics, which is presently (more or less) accepted as mandatory 
to meet the definition resistant hypertension. At the time, we 
designed our study that was not yet so clearly the case. Indeed, 
it is possible that the lack of diuretic use has influenced our 
results. Finally, the drug level measurements provided quali-
tative results: the drug is either detectable or not detectable. 
Therefore, we might have underestimated the number of 
changes because dosage and class changes were not detected.
Perspectives
This study shows in primary analysis that RDN is not supe-
rior to usual care in reducing BP in participants with resistant 
hypertension. Medication adherence seems to be very low 
when participants are unaware of monitoring. Our data suggest 
that poor adherence (partially) explains the condition of resis-
tant hypertension. Second, and importantly, our data suggest 
that the direction and the magnitude of the treatment effect 
considerably change when medication adherence is taken into 
account. This factor could also have been of relevance in ear-
lier RDN studies. It can only be overcome in future trials by 
studying unmedicated participants or by detailed monitoring 
of prescribed and actually used medication.

What Is New?
• This is the first randomized controlled trial on the effect of renal denerva-
tion on blood pressure that included a baseline and end-of-study objec-
tive measurement of adherence to antihypertensive medication.
What Is Relevant?
• In primary analysis renal denervation was not superior to usual care 
alone in patients with resistant hypertension.
• Medication adherence was very low in resistant hypertensive patients 
participating in a trial.
• In patients with proven stable adherence during the study, the direction 
and magnitude of the effect on blood pressure differed from the primary 
analysis.
Summary
Medication adherence is very low in resistant hypertension patients 
and changes over time, which has considerable effect on the over-
all interpretation of the results. Objective assessment of medication 
adherence is mandatory in future trials in (resistant) hypertensive 
patients.
