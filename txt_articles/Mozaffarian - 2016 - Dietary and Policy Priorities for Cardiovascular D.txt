Abstract—Suboptimal nutrition is a leading cause of poor health. Nutrition and policy science have advanced rapidly, 
creating confusion yet also providing powerful opportunities to reduce the adverse health and economic impacts of poor 
diets. This review considers the history, new evidence, controversies, and corresponding lessons for modern dietary 
and policy priorities for cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Major identified themes include the 
importance of evaluating the full diversity of diet-related risk pathways, not only blood lipids or obesity; focusing on 
foods and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients; recognizing the complex influences of different foods 
on long-term weight regulation, rather than simply counting calories; and characterizing and implementing evidence-
based strategies, including policy approaches, for lifestyle change. Evidence-informed dietary priorities include increased 
fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, vegetable oils, yogurt, and minimally processed whole grains; and 
fewer red meats, processed (eg, sodium-preserved) meats, and foods rich in refined grains, starch, added sugars, salt, and 
trans fat. More investigation is needed on the cardiometabolic effects of phenolics, dairy fat, probiotics, fermentation, 
coffee, tea, cocoa, eggs, specific vegetable and tropical oils, vitamin D, individual fatty acids, and diet-microbiome 
interactions. Little evidence to date supports the cardiometabolic relevance of other popular priorities: eg, local, organic, 
grass-fed, farmed/wild, or non–genetically modified. Evidence-based personalized nutrition appears to depend more 
on nongenetic characteristics (eg, physical activity, abdominal adiposity, gender, socioeconomic status, culture) than 
genetic factors. Food choices must be strongly supported by clinical behavior change efforts, health systems reforms, 
novel technologies, and robust policy strategies targeting economic incentives, schools and workplaces, neighborhood 
environments, and the food system. Scientific advances provide crucial new insights on optimal targets and best practices 
to reduce the burdens of diet-related cardiometabolic diseases. (Circulation. 2016;133:187-225. DOI: 10.1161/

Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, 
Diabetes, and Obesity
A Comprehensive Review
Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH
S
uboptimal diet is the leading risk factor for death and disabil-
ity in the United States and worldwide.1,2 Among disadvan-
taged populations in all nations, hunger and malnutrition cause 
enormous suffering. Simultaneously, diet-related cardiometa-
bolic diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity produce even larger global 
health burdens. Other vascular conditions including peripheral 
arterial disease, chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline, heart 
failure, and atrial fibrillation are also influenced by diet-related 
risk factors. Worldwide, chronic diseases will cause $17.3 tril-
lion of cumulative economic loss between 2011 and 2030 from 
healthcare expenditures, reduced productivity, and lost capital.3 
Considering these health and economic burdens, diet-related ill-
nesses are among the leading priorities of our time.
In recent years, global dietary patterns have shifted in 
nearly every nation in the world.4 At the same time, nutrition 
science has advanced remarkably. In comparison with historical 
dietary recommendations which were based largely on cross-
national studies, short-term experiments, and animal models, 
nutrition science has been transformed in the past 2 decades by 
more rigorous evidence from well-designed metabolic studies, 
prospective cohorts, and randomized clinical trials.
Several key lessons have emerged (Table 1). First, it is 
now evident that dietary habits influence diverse cardiometa-
bolic risk factors, including not only obesity and low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but also blood pressure (BP), 
glucose-insulin homeostasis, lipoprotein concentrations and 
function, oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial health, 
hepatic function, adipocyte metabolism, cardiac function, 
metabolic expenditure, pathways of weight regulation, visceral 
adiposity, and the microbiome (Figure 1). Whereas decades 
of dietary recommendations focused on dietary fat and blood

cholesterol and current dietary discussions are often preoccu-
pied with total calories and obesity, the full health impact of 
diet extends far beyond these pathways. Cardiometabolic con-
sequences of any nutrient, food, or overall diet should not be 
extrapolated from any single surrogate outcome,5 but assessed 
based on the totality of evidence including interventional trials 
evaluating multiple risk pathways, prospective cohort studies 
of clinical events, and, where available, randomized trials of 
clinical events.6,7
A second key lesson is the importance of specific foods 
and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients, 
for cardiometabolic risk.8,9 Indeed, focusing on isolated nutri-
ents often leads to paradoxical dietary choices and industry 
formulations. A food-based approach also better facilitates 
public guidance and minimizes industry manipulation.
Third, the science of obesity has progressed dramatically. 
Similar to lessons for CHD risk, the primary prevention of 
obesity – avoidance of long-term weight gain – may prove 
more effective and enduring than secondary prevention – 
obesity treatment after it has occurred. The diverse, complex 
physiological mechanisms of long-term weight homeostasis 
are also being elucidated. These lines of evidence indicate 
that an energy-imbalance concept of obesity is oversimplified. 
Whereas short-term weight loss can be achieved by any type 
of calorie-reduced diet, in the long term, counting calories 
may not be biologically nor behaviorally relevant. Rather, the 
quality and types of foods consumed influence diverse path-
ways related to weight homeostasis, such as satiety, hunger, 
brain reward, glucose-insulin responses, hepatic de novo lipo-
genesis, adipocyte function, metabolic expenditure, and the 
microbiome. Thus, all calories are not equal for long-term adi-
posity: certain foods impair pathways of weight homeostasis, 
others have relatively neutral effects, and others promote the 
integrity of weight regulation.
Finally, major strides have been made in the science of 
individual, sociocultural, and environmental determinants of 
dietary choices. Influences are complex, including individual-
level, sociocultural, community, agricultural, industry, govern-
mental, and global contributors.10 Several individual, health 
system, and policy-level strategies now have strong evidence 
for efficacy.11 Elucidation of methods for better translation of 
these approaches is needed.
This article summarizes the modern evidence for health 
effects of diet on cardiometabolic diseases, including key 
evidence-based priorities, relevant mechanisms, and major 
unanswered questions, and the evidence on barriers and 
opportunities for behavior change in the clinic, health sys-
tem, and population, including novel policy and technology 
strategies.
Nutrients, Foods, and Diet Patterns 
– a Historical Evolution
In 1747, Captain James Lind performed one of the earliest 
recorded clinical trials. Based on earlier observations, he 
assigned British sailors who had scurvy to several different 
treatments.9,12 Only 1 group – those receiving citrus fruits – 
improved, providing new evidence that a specific dietary fac-
tor could cure disease. By the turn of the century, the British 
fleet routinely added lemon or lime juice to rations, a practice 
making them famous as “limeys”.
Yet, it was not until 1932 that the first vitamin was 
 
 
isolated – vitamin C – and was verified as the active pro-
tective constituent against scurvy. This confirmed, for the 
first time, that specific dietary nutrients could prevent dis-
ease. Over the next 2 decades, an explosion of nutrition 
science confirmed other single-nutrient diseases such as 
beriberi (thiamine), pellagra (niacin), anemia (iron), goiter 
(iodine), night blindness (vitamin A), and rickets (vitamin 
D). Coincident to these scientific advances, geopolitical 
events – the Great Depression, World War II – greatly mag-
nified attention on food shortages and nutrient inadequacy. 
Indeed, the first Recommended Dietary Allowances origi-
nated in 1941 by order of President Franklin Roosevelt, 
when he convened the National Nutrition Conference on 
Defense to ensure a population fit for war by minimiz-
ing nutrient deficiency diseases.13,14 That same year, the 
American Medical Association declared that, “research 
in nutrition be encouraged” with primary aims of 
Table 1. Key New Lessons from Modern Nutritional Science
Diverse physiological effects of diet
Dietary habits influence a myriad of cardiometabolic risk factors, including blood pressure, glucose-insulin 
homeostasis, lipoprotein concentrations and function, inflammation, endothelial health, hepatic function, adipocyte 
metabolism, cardiac function, metabolic expenditure, and pathways of weight regulation, visceral adiposity, and the 
microbiome. Focus on single surrogate outcomes can be misleading. Based on these diverse effects, diet quality is 
more relevant than quantity, and the primary emphasis should be cardiovascular and metabolic health, not simply 
body weight or obesity.
Importance of foods and diet patterns
Specific foods and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients, are most relevant for cardiometabolic 
health. The historical focus on isolated nutrients contributes to confusion about what constitutes a healthy diet, 
distracts from more effective strategies, and drives industry, policy makers, and the public toward diets which meet 
selected nutrient cut points but provide little health benefit.
Complexity of obesity and weight regulation
Diet quality influences diverse pathways related to weight homeostasis, including satiety, hunger, brain reward, 
glucose-insulin responses, hepatic de novo lipogenesis, adipocyte function, metabolic expenditure, and the 
microbiome. For long-term weight control, all calories are not created equal because of the divergent long-term 
effects of different foods on these pathways of weight homeostasis.
Individual, health systems, and policy 
approaches for behavior change
Multiple evidence-based strategies for improving dietary behaviors have now been identified, including at the 
individual (patient) level, in health systems, and in populations. Integrated, multicomponent approaches that 
include upstream policy measures, midstream educational efforts, and downstream community and environmental 
approaches may be especially effective.

“estimating the amounts of essential nutrients in foods,”  
“detection of nutritional deficiency states,” and more precise 
determination of “optimum and minimum requirements” for 
each nutrient.15 Consequently, all of the first Recommended 
Dietary Allowances focused on nutrient deficiency, includ-
ing for calories, protein, iron, calcium, thiamin, riboflavin, 
niacin, and vitamins A, C, and D. Based on this chance con-
vergence of scientific and geopolitical events, US dietary 
guidelines over most of the 20th century emphasized pre-
vention of single-nutrient deficiencies.14
With the modernization of agriculture, food processing, 
and food formulations, nutrient deficiencies rapidly receded 
in the United States and other high-income nations. In their 
place, a growing epidemic of chronic diseases was recognized. 
Beginning in 1980, for the first time, US dietary guidelines 
began to focus on chronic disease.14 The main available evi-
dence derived from less robust study designs: eg, crude cross-
national comparisons, short-term experiments of surrogate 
outcomes in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, after decades of 
emphasis on deficiency diseases, the single-nutrient paradigm 
continued to dominate research approaches and interpreta-
tions. Together, these factors caused oversimplified inferences 
on how diet influences cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabe-
tes mellitus, and obesity. Scientists and policy makers intui-
tively followed earlier methods that had been so successful 
in reducing deficiencies: identify the relevant nutrient, estab-
lish its target intake, and translate this to recommendations. 
To many, saturated fat and cholesterol became the causes of 
CHD, and total fat became the cause of obesity. Thus, the 
1980 Dietary Guidelines remained heavily nutrient-focused: 
“avoid too much fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol; eat foods 
with adequate starch and fiber; avoid too much sugar; avoid 
too much sodium.”
Modern evidence now demonstrates the limitations 
of this single-nutrient component focus. The framework 
of Recommended Dietary Allowances was quickly rec-
ognized as methodologically and conceptually inappro-
priate for chronic diseases, leading to the creation of new 
nutrient-based metrics (eg, Adequate Intakes; Acceptable 
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges) which were themselves 
limited by imprecise definitions and inconsistent usage.16 
Furthermore, although scientific investigation of macro- 
and micronutrients remains essential to elucidate biological 
mechanisms, the complex matrix of foods, food processing, 
and food preparation strongly modifies the final health 
effects.8,9,17,18 Translation of nutrient-based targets to the 
public also proved difficult: few people understand or can 
accurately estimate without guidance their daily consump-
tion of nutrients such as calories, fats, cholesterol, fiber, 
salt, or single vitamins. Most importantly, methodologic 
advances in nutrition science now demonstrate that nutrient-
focused metrics are inadequate to explain most effects of 
diet on chronic diseases. Rather, cardiometabolic diseases 
are largely influenced not by single nutrients, but by specific 
foods and overall diet patterns.19–21
These historical events elucidate the current state of nutri-
tion. Modern dietary science is surprisingly young – only 83 
years have elapsed since the first vitamin was isolated – and 
much of its existence was focused on single-nutrient diseases. 
The major impact of diet on chronic diseases was not widely 
appreciated until even more recently, 35 to 40 years ago. And, 
not until the last 15 to 20 years has the scientific methodology 
become sufficiently advanced to provide strong, consistent 
inference on diet, chronic diseases, and relevant metabolic 
pathways. Thus, the present period is one of exciting, rapid 
transition away from single-nutrient theories and simple 
surrogate outcomes and toward foods, dietary patterns, and 
evaluation of clinical end points. This transition forms the 
basis for our modern understanding of diet and cardiometa-
bolic health.
Dietary Patterns
Dietary patterns represent the overall combination of foods 
habitually consumed, which together produce synergistic 
health effects. Evidence-informed beneficial diet patterns 
share several key characteristics (Table 2).19,21–23 These include 
more minimally processed foods such as fruits, nuts/seeds, 
vegetables (excluding russet or white potatoes), legumes, 
whole grains, seafood, yogurt, and vegetable oils; and fewer 
red meats, processed (sodium-preserved) meats, and foods 
rich in refined grains, starches, and added sugars. Such diets 
are higher in fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, minerals, phenolics, 
and unsaturated fats, and lower in glycemic index, glycemic 
load, salt, and trans fat.
The scientific concordance, controversy, and related evi-
dence for these and other key dietary targets are variable 
(Table 3). As described above, this reflects the youthful nature 
of the science of nutrition and chronic disease, together with

†As a practical rule-of-thumb for selecting healthful whole grains and avoiding carbohydrate-rich products high in starches and added sugars, the ratio of total 
carbohydrate to dietary fiber (g/serving of each) appears useful.168,169 Foods with ratios <10:1 are preferable; ie, food containing at least 1 g of fiber for every 10 g of total 
carbohydrate. In addition, minimally processed whole grains (eg, steel-cut oats, stone-ground bread) are generally preferable to finely milled whole grains (eg, many 
commercial whole-grain breads and breakfast cereals) because of the larger glycemic responses of the latter.
‡Current evidence does not permit clear differentiation of whether low-fat or whole-fat products are superior for cardiometabolic health. Other characteristics, such 
as probiotic content or fermentation, may be far more relevant than fat content.
§The US Food and Drug Administration recently ruled that the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils is no longer “generally regarded as safe,”384 which should 
effectively eliminate the majority of industrial trans fats from the US food supply. Several countries including Denmark, Argentina, Austria, Iceland, and Switzerland 
have effectively eliminated the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils through direct legislation on the amounts of allowable trans fats in foods. Small amounts of 
certain trans fatty acids may be formed through other industrial processes, including oil deodorization and high-temperature cooking; the health effects of these trace 
industrial trans fats require careful investigation.

diet – produces larger cardiometabolic benefits.24–26 Both 
Mediterranean and DASH diet patterns improve a range of 
risk factors, reduce long-term weight gain, and are consis-
tently associated with lower risk of clinical events.19,21,27–29 
Pathways of benefit appear diverse, including effects on BP, 
glucose-insulin homeostasis, blood lipids and lipoproteins, 
inflammation, endothelial function, arrhythmic risk, and pos-
sibly coagulation/thrombosis, paraoxonase 1 activity, and 
the gut microbiome.20,21,30 Based on sociocultural and feasi-
bility considerations, not every population in the world can 
consume a traditional Mediterranean diet. Other examples of 
Mediterranean-style dietary patterns, with adaption to various 
regions of the world, have been proposed.31
Randomized clinical trials in both primary and secondary 
prevention populations confirm the benefits of healthful, food-
based diet patterns that were identified in prospective cohort stud-
ies and short-term interventional trials: such diets significantly 
reduce both cardiovascular events and diabetes mellitus.32–35 In 
comparison, both observational cohorts and randomized trials 
confirm little clinical benefit of diets focused on isolated nutrient 
targets, such as low-fat, low-saturated fat diets, which produce 
no significant benefits on cardiovascular disease, diabetes mel-
litus, or insulin resistance.36–39 This contrast in effectiveness of 
healthful, food-based versus nutrient-focused dietary targets is 
exemplified by comparing the results of 2 of the largest, longest-
duration dietary trials ever performed (Figure 2).
Based on this evidence, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines 
Advisory Committee concluded that low-fat diets have no 
effect on CVD and emphasized the importance of healthful, 
food-based diet patterns.21 Notably, because additives such as 
sodium and industrial trans fats can be added to or removed 
from otherwise similar commercially prepared foods, a spe-
cific emphasis on their reduction is also warranted.21
Focusing on overall diet patterns, rather than individual 
nutrients or foods, can also facilitate individual behavioral 
counseling and population dietary recommendations, because 
such patterns permit greater flexibility and personal prefer-
ences in diet choices.21 In addition, such patterns can lead to 
health benefits by means of smaller changes across several 
dietary factors, rather than major changes in a few factors, 
potentially increasing effectiveness and compliance.
People who follow vegetarian diets are often health con-
scious and tend toward healthful food patterns. However, veg-
etarianism per se is neither necessary nor sufficient for a good 
diet: indeed, french fries and soda are vegetarian, as are other 
harmful factors such as refined grains, starches, added sug-
ars, sweets, trans fats, and sodium. Thus, a vegetarian diet is 
not a guarantee of health, whereas a nonvegetarian diet can be 
rich in healthful foods. A cardioprotective diet pattern must 
be characterized by the healthful foods that are included, not 
simply specific items to be avoided (Table 2).
Other increasingly popular dietary patterns include 
low-carbohydrate diets (minimizing all carbohydrates) and 
paleo diets (attempting to conform to food types consumed 
over millennia during human evolution). A main benefit of 
both low-carbohydrate and paleo diets is reduced refined 
grains, starches, and added sugars, which represent the 
majority of total carbohydrates and ultraprocessed foods in 
modern diets (see Carbohydrate-Rich Foods, below). Paleo 
diets also emphasize fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, 
and fish, each of which has health benefits. However, focus 
on low carbohydrate could paradoxically reduce intakes

of other, healthful carbohydrate-containing foods such as 
fruits, legumes, and minimally processed whole grains; 
while paleo guidelines often recommend liberal intakes 
of red meats, lard, and salt and the avoidance of legumes 
and dairy. A maximally beneficial diet pattern should con-
currently emphasize reductions in refined (not all) carbo-
hydrates, processed meats, and foods high in sodium and 
trans fat; moderation in unprocessed red meats, poultry, 
eggs, and milk; and high intakes of fruits, nuts, fish, veg-
etables (excluding russet/white potatoes), vegetable oils,

Diet Quality, Energy Balance, Obesity, and Weight 
Gain
Just as the science of cardiovascular risk is moving away from 
theories based on single-nutrient components and single-
surrogate outcomes toward empirical evidence on foods and 
dietary patterns and clinical events, the science of obesity is 
moving away from simplistic ideas of energy balance, will 
power, and calorie counting toward the elucidation of effects 
of foods and diet patterns on the complex physiological deter-
minants of long-term weight regulation. Of course, total calo-
ries matter in the short term, which is why people can initially 
lose weight on nearly any type of diet21 – and explaining why 
so many fad diets initially seem to work. In the short term, 
the best predictor of success is mindfulness with one’s chosen 
diet. However, for long-term weight maintenance and for car-
diometabolic health independent of adiposity, healthful food–
based patterns are most relevant (Table 2).21
Because obesity is so challenging to treat after it has 
developed, the primary prevention of weight gain is a prom-
ising strategy for individual patients and for populations. An 
average American adult gains only ≈1 lb (0.45 kg) per year,28 
consistent with habitual excess energy intakes as small as 
≈50 kcal/d explaining the gradual weight gain seen in many 
people.40 This finding accentuates just how well our body’s 
homeostatic mechanisms actually function to maintain long-
term weight stability. Yet, when sustained over many years, 
this minor annual weight gain drives population obesity, eg, 
leading to 10 lbs weight gain over 10 years, 20 lbs over 20 
years, and so on.
In many countries, the current obesity epidemic is a strik-
ing change from decades of prior relative stability; in the 
United States, for instance, obesity began steeply rising only 
about 30 years ago.41 Abdominal adiposity, which produces the 
largest metabolic harms, has also increased to a greater extent 
than overall weight in many nations, especially in younger 
women and certain middle-income countries.42 This modern 
rise in overweight and obesity is also occurring in children 
across most nations.43 The full long-term health consequences 
of adiposity in these youthful generations remain to be seen, 
in whom rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease, dyslipidemia, and hypertension exceed anything 
observed at these ages in previous human history.44 The esca-
lation of adiposity at youngest ages, including those <5 years 
of age, is also informative for considering potential causes. 
At such ages, population-wide declines in willpower, ability 
to count calories, or physical activity are difficult to invoke, 
reinforcing the likely role of environmental determinants of 
weight dysregulation.
Elucidating the specific dietary and nondietary determi-
nants of long-term weight homeostasis is critical to under-
stand and reverse the environmental changes contributing to 
this population imbalance. Growing evidence suggests that 
energy imbalance is a consequence of multiple complex, 
upstream effects, in particular poor diet quality (Figure 4). In 
other words, poor diet quality is a driver of excess diet quan-
tity. Furthermore, independently of energy balance, diet qual-
ity influences metabolic risk and propensity toward abdominal 
adiposity. Mechanisms appear to include calorie-independent 
effects of different types of foods on satiety, glucose-insulin 
Figure 2. Contrasting results of randomized controlled dietary 
trials focusing on isolated nutrients (Top) versus food-based 
diet patterns (Bottom). The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI, Top) 
focused on nutrient targets and reducing total fat and achieved 
large long-term changes in these targets, yet had no signifi-
cant effect on cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. The 
Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial (Bottom) 
focused on food-based diet patterns and increasing specific 
healthful foods, especially nuts and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), 
with smaller dietary changes than in WHI, yet demonstrating sig-
nificant reduction in cardiovascular disease and diabetes melli-
tus. Both trials successfully altered long-term diets, although with 
more modest dietary changes in PREDIMED. However, only the 
food-based intervention resulted in clinical benefit. CHD indicates

responses,45 liver fat synthesis,46 adipocyte function,47 visceral 
adiposity,48 brain craving and reward,49 and even metabolic 
expenditure.50 The gut microbiome also appears increasingly 
important; eg, probiotics in yogurt appear to interact with 
microbiota to reduce weight gain.28,29,51–54 In addition, inde-
pendent of calories and body weight, one’s dietary pattern 
strongly influences metabolic dysfunction including the risk 
of diabetes mellitus.19,21 This is analogous to the weight-inde-
pendent metabolic benefits of physical activity; diet quality 
has similar robust metabolic benefits (or harms).
Based on these influences, when consumed over years, 
certain foods may interfere with long-term weight homeo-
stasis, others have relatively neutral effects, and others pro-
mote healthy weight regulation (Figure 5).19,21 For long-term 
weight gain, food rich in refined grains, starches, and sugar 
appear to be major culprits.28,29 Such rapidly digested, low-
fiber carbohydrates drive many obesogenic pathways.45,46,48–50 
Key foods in this group include potatoes, white bread, white 
rice, refined breakfast cereals, crackers, sweets, soda, and 
other ultraprocessed foods high in starches or sugars. In con-
trast, intakes of other foods, such as low-fat milk and whole-
fat milk, appear relatively neutral, suggesting they do not 
perturb the normal homeostatic mechanisms for long-term 
weight control.29,51 For meats, cheese, and eggs, influences on 
long-term weight gain appear to vary depending on whether 
they are consumed together with refined carbohydrates (in 
which case more weight gain is evident) or in place of refined 
carbohydrates (in which less weight gain or even relative 
weight loss is seen).29
Conversely, increased fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, 
yogurt, fish, and whole grains each appear to protect against 
chronic weight gain: the more these foods are consumed, the 
less the average weight gain.28,29,51,55 The mechanistic pathways 
underlying these observed benefits are still being elucidated, 
but may partly reflect opposing, protective effects in compari-
son with those of rapidly digested, refined carbohydrates.
Based on these complexities, choosing foods based on cal-
orie content can lead to paradoxical dietary choices, industry 
formulations, and policy recommendations. For example, the 
US National School Lunch Programs recently banned whole 
milk, but allows sugar-sweetened chocolate skim milk.56 This 
untested intervention in 31 000 000 American children is 
based on hypothesized effects of total calories, total fat, and 
saturated fat in milk,56 rather than empirical evidence on the 
health effects of whole versus skim milk. Longitudinal stud-
ies suggest no harms of whole-fat milk for obesity, diabetes 
mellitus, or cardiovascular disease in adults28,29,51,57,58; that 
dairy fat may have potential benefits for diabetes mellitus59–61; 
that people switching to low-fat dairy products compensate 
elsewhere in their diet by increasing consumption of carbohy-
drates29; and that children who habitually drink low-fat milk 
gain more weight, and those who drink whole-fat milk gain 
less weight, over time.62–66 Many other ironies result from a 
calorie focus: eg, recommendations to consume fat-free salad 
dressing, in which healthful vegetable oils have been removed 
and replaced with starch, sugar, and salt; to minimize nuts 
because of their fat content and energy density; and to con-
sume low-fat deli meats that are loaded with sodium.
In sum, modern evidence indicates that different foods 
have very different obesogenic potential depending on their 
influence on complex, multifactorial pathways of weight regu-
lation. To prevent long-term weight gain, calories and portion 
sizes from certain types of foods should be minimized; from 
others, not emphasized; and from others, actually increased. 
Other conventional metrics – eg, total fat, energy density, 
even added sugar– may not reliably identify how specific 
foods influence weight gain.28,29,51 Consistent with this mod-
ern science, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
Report emphasizes food-based, healthful diet patterns as a pri-
mary recommendation to address obesity.21
Several other lifestyle factors appear to interact with diet 
to influence adiposity. These include TV watching, sleep dura-
tion, circadian alignment, and possibly maternal-fetal (eg, pla-
cental) influences.28,41,67–70 For example, lower sleep duration 
and altered circadian rhythms are linked to greater weight 
gain and obesity, alter hunger and food preferences, and may 
influence leptin, ghrelin, insulin, and gut-peptide concentra-
tions.28,67 Greater hours spent TV watching also independently 
increase obesity and weight gain28,68; 2 randomized trials in 
children suggest this is primarily mediated by changes in diet 
(rather than changes in, physical activity) owing to increased 
eating in front of the TV and altered food choices attribut-
able to viewed marketing.71,72 Increasing physical activity, of 
course, has complementary benefits on weight maintenance 
and metabolic health. Other societal and environmental influ-
ences likely have additional effects, including education, 
income, race/ethnicity, social norms and networks, industry 
marketing, and local food availability.10,11,73
In sum, these complex and often insidious influences 
make unintended weight gain very easy. Conversely, based on 
Figure 3. Evidence-based dietary priorities for cardiometabolic 
health. The placement of each food/factor is based on its net 
effects on cardiometabolic health, across all risk pathways and 
clinical end points, and the strength of the evidence, as well. 
For dietary factors not listed (eg, coffee, tea, cocoa), the current 
evidence remains insufficient to identify these as dietary priorities 
for either increased or decreased consumption (see Table 3).

these effects, modest behavioral and environmental improve-
ments can attenuate or reverse chronic energy gaps, weight 
gain, and adiposity. Based on current available evidence, key 
diet-related priorities to reduce adiposity are reduction in 
refined grains, starches, sugars, and meats; limiting industry 
marketing especially from TV; increasing intakes of fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, yogurt, fish, vegetable oils, and whole grains; 
sleeping at least 7 to 8 hours nightly; and further elucidating 
maternal-fetal, microbiome, and sleep/circadian influences.
Individual Susceptibility – Genetics and 
Personalized Nutrition
Interest is growing in quantifying and understanding the deter-
minants of interindividual variation in responses to diet. One 
aim is personalized nutrition – the ability to provide custom-
ized dietary advice specialized to each person’s unique profile 
of genes and other underlying characteristics.
Although candidate gene approaches have identified 
several potential gene-diet interactions for traits including 
blood cholesterol levels, a major challenge has been lack of 
replication.74–77 Even for better documented gene-diet inter-
actions – eg, for the APOE locus, dietary saturated fat, and 
LDL-cholesterol; or for the CETP locus, alcohol, and high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol – evidence for clinical 
relevance of these differences remains weak.74 Large investi-
gations pooling multiple cohorts have observed main (popu-
lation) effects of either dietary influences or genes on major 
cardiometabolic risk factors, but evidence for interactions 
between diet and these genes is uncommon and, more rel-
evantly, magnitudes of such potential interactions are often 
small.78–83 One of the more promising gene-diet interactions, 
notable in Hispanic populations, involves PNPLA3 and sugar 
consumption in relation to obesity and liver fat accumula-
tion84–86; additional interaction with dietary polyunsaturated 
fats could also be present.87 Potential influences of diet on 
epigenetic changes (eg, DNA methylation) and subsequent 
cardiometabolic risk pathways are also of considerable inter-
est,88 but relevant between-individual variation in these diet-
epigenetic responses has yet to be identified. At present, 
compelling evidence is lacking to design personalized nutri-
tional recommendations for cardiometabolic health based on 
genetic variation.
Other underlying individual characteristics may be bet-
ter determinants of personalized guidance. For instance, 
carbohydrate-induced glycemic responses appear especially 
detrimental in women,89 suggesting the particular need for 
women to avoid rapidly digested carbohydrates. Other studies 
suggest that people with greater insulin resistance experience 
greater short-term weight loss with low-carbohydrate than 
with low-fat diets.90 Similarly, patients with diabetes melli-
tus, impaired glucose tolerance, or atherogenic dyslipidemia 
may also benefit most from reducing refined carbohydrates 
and increasing proteins and vegetable fats.91–93 In addition, 
 
personalized  
cognitive-behavioral and culturally and socio-
economically sensitive strategies increase effectiveness of 
clinical approaches to behavior change.94,95

Overall, although a promise of precision medicine has 
been promoted,96 the massive, rapid shifts in cardiometabolic 
disease occurring across nations and within populations over 
time97 demonstrate the dominant influence of environmental 
risk factors–and therefore the crucial importance of popula-
tion approaches to address these environmental risks, includ-
ing improved nutrition. In addition, population strategies to 
address diet, such as economic incentives, can reduce socioeco-
nomic-related disparities in health, whereas individual-based 
approaches may exacerbate inequities.98,99 Evidence-based 
personalized approaches, especially related to underlying non-
genetic characteristics, should be considered a complement to 
such population efforts.
Food Processing
Potential health effects of food processing are receiving 
increasing attention.100–102 Nearly all foods must undergo some 
processing to be consumed – eg, cooking, smoking, drying, salt-
ing, fermenting, preserving, heating, milling, refining. Benefits 
of processing include improved palatability, variety, nutrient 
bioavailability, shelf life, and convenience, and reduced risk of 
food-borne pathogens. Potential harms include loss of nutri-
ents such as fiber, phenolics, minerals, fatty acids, vitamins, 
and other bioactives; increased doses and rapidity of digestion 
of starch and sugar; and introduction of harmful factors such 
as sodium, other preservatives, trans fats, heterocyclic amines, 
advanced glycation end products, and other compounds.
Figure 5. Protein-rich foods and long-term weight gain in 3 separate US prospective cohort studies, based on 16 to 24 years of follow-
up. Weight changes every 4 years are shown for each 1-serving/d increase in consumption; decreased consumption would be associ-
ated with the inverse weight changes. To convert pounds to kilograms to pounds, divide by 2.2. All weight changes were adjusted for 
age, baseline body mass index, sleep duration, and concurrent changes in smoking status, physical activity, television watching, alco-
hol use, and consumption of fruits, vegetables, glycemic load, and all of the dietary factors in the figure simultaneously. NHS indicates

Many healthful foods are minimally processed (eg, fruits, 
nuts, seafood), whereas several classes of processed foods are 
harmful (eg, refined grains and cereals, preserved meats and 
other high-sodium foods, food made with partially hydrogenated 
oils). This can lead to an impression to always select “natural” 
and always avoid processed or ultraprocessed foods. Because 
many minimally processed foods are healthful, and many more 
highly processed foods are not, this can serve as a useful gen-
eral rule. However, it is not absolute. For example, some more 
natural foods such as eggs, butter, and unprocessed red meats are 
not linked to improved cardiometabolic outcomes (see Foods, 
below), whereas other packaged or processed foods (eg, nut- and 
fruit-rich snacks, phenolic- and polyunsaturated-rich vegetable 
oils and margarines) improve cardiometabolic health.
Consequently, both the type of food and its processing 
are relevant. Rather than focusing only on natural versus pro-
cessed, the clinician, consumer, policy maker, and food pro-
ducer should emphasize foods that are both innately healthful 
and less processed; and reject foods rich in refined grains, 
starch, and added sugars and harmful additives such as sodium 
and trans fat (Table 2). In addition, as the global food system 
moves toward more processed foods,103 further rigorous inves-
tigation is needed to define and disseminate methods for opti-
mal processing, rather than an impractical focus on complete 
absence of processing.
Dietary Supplements, Functional Foods
Use of dietary supplements, often at high or pharmacological 
doses, is commonplace, despite the absence of convincing evi-
dence for health benefits. Many supplements have been evalu-
ated in observational studies and controlled trials as potential 
therapies to prevent CVD or other conditions (Table 4).104–110 
Evaluated doses in such trials have often exceeded usual or 
even recommended dietary intakes, often under the assump-
tions that higher levels would produce greater benefits, and 
that there was little risk of harm. Evidence has accrued that 
most of these supplements have little CVD benefit, and that 
certain supplements including β-carotene, calcium, and vita-
min E may even be harmful.105–108,111–113 Presently, fish oil may 
be considered as a supplement for CVD prevention, especially 
among patients with prevalent CHD, based on reduction of 
cardiac death109 (see Fish, above). Overall, the current evi-
dence does not support use of other dietary supplements to 
duplicate or complement the cardioprotective benefits of con-
sumption of healthful foods.
Similar to dietary supplements, functional foods attempt 
to improve health by incorporating bioactive compounds 
that may alter lipid, vascular, and other metabolic pathways, 
microbiome composition and function, and digestive and 
inflammatory systems.114–121 Such putative compounds include 
specific peptides, fatty acids, phenolics, vitamins, dietary 
fibers, prebiotics/probiotics, and plant sterols/stanols. Many 
of these bioactive compounds have demonstrated effects on 
cardiovascular risk pathways in animal and human studies; 
effects on blood lipids have been most often studied. To date, 
the potential impact of these and other promising functional 
foods on clinical end points is generally not established and 
requires investigation.
Based on cholesterol-lowering effects, some organiza-
tions suggest that functional foods with plant sterols/stanols 
can be considered for people with higher cholesterol levels 
who do not qualify for or have insufficient response to phar-
macotherapy116; although others have concluded that plant 
sterols/stanols could have unacceptable toxicities.122,123 In the 
Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial, sup-
plementation with extra virgin olive oil or mixed nuts, com-
bined with advice to consume a Mediterranean-type diet, led 
to significant reductions in cardiovascular events,34 suggesting 
that these more natural foods could be considered as evidence-
informed functional foods to reduce CVD events.
Table 4. Selected Dietary Supplements and Cardiovascular Health – Summary of the Evidence
β-Carotene
Some cohort studies have linked low serum levels or low dietary intake of β-carotene with higher CVD risk. Trials of β-carotene 
supplements document no benefit in the general population and increased risk of lung cancer in patients who were at high risk of lung 
cancer.
Calcium
Meta-analysis of trials suggests that calcium supplementation could increase the risk of myocardial infarction. No evidence for 
cardiometabolic benefits.
Vitamin D
Evidence from observational studies indicates that low serum vitamin D levels, which are largely determined by sun exposure, are 
associated with higher risk of CVD. Trials of vitamin D supplementation have not shown reductions in risk of CVD. Additional trials using 
higher doses of vitamin D supplementation are ongoing.
Vitamin E
Several prospective cohort studies have linked vitamin E consumption or supplementation with lower risk of CHD. Trials have failed to 
show reductions in CVD events with supplemental vitamin E, and 2 meta-analyses suggest that high-dose vitamin E supplements may 
increase total mortality.
Folic acid, Vitamins B6, B12
Observational studies have associated low folate intake, low serum folate levels, and high homocysteine levels with higher risk of 
CVD outcomes. Trials have confirmed that folic acid supplementation lowers blood homocysteine levels. Long-term trials have not 
documented benefits of folic acid with or without vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 on CVD outcomes. In some trials, supplemental folic acid 
was associated with increased risk of CVD.
Fish oil
Multiple cohort studies have documented an inverse relationship between fish intake and subsequent CHD, in particular, CHD death. 
A meta-analysis of trials, largely in higher-risk populations, demonstrated a reduction in cardiac death with fish oil supplementation, 
largely because of the benefits in patients with prevalent CHD.
Multivitamins
Although some cohort studies have seen lower CVD risk with multivitamin supplements, several trials, rated to be of fair to poor quality, 
have not documented any clear CVD benefit of multivitamin use in mixed populations.
CHD indicates coronary heart disease; and CVD, cardiovascular disease.

Emerging Issues: Organic, 
Genetic Modification
Public and media attention have increasingly considered 
whether foods are organic (ie, produced without artificial 
chemicals or pesticides) or genetically modified. Compared 
with conventionally grown foods, organically grown foods 
can contain higher concentrations of phenolic compounds 
and fewer pesticide residues; yet, they also have similar nutri-
ent profiles in many other respects.124–126 Evidence for the 
health relevance of the observed differences in certain trace 
compounds has generally not been identified and remains 
controversial.127–129
Genetic modification uses biotechnology to alter crop or 
livestock genes to improve insect or virus resistance, herbicide 
tolerance, nutritional qualities, or resistance to environmental 
stressors. In light of challenges in population growth, global 
climate, soil and water availability, and changing pathogens, 
genetic modification holds promise to improve production, 
healthfulness, and sustainability. Several groups reviewing the 
evidence for the health hazards of genetic modification have 
found no evidence for harms130–134; however, methods for such 
evaluation remain heterogeneous.135–139 Based on first princi-
ples, genetic modification should be considered a tool, not an 
end point: its potential effects on human health (positive, neu-
tral, negative) will relate to the specific compositional changes 
in the food, not to the method itself.140
Based on current evidence, whether a food is organic or 
genetically modified appears to be of relatively small health 
relevance in comparison with the overall types of foods and 
diet patterns actually consumed (Table 2). Health and environ-
mental effects of both organic and genetically modified foods 
require continued evaluation as these technologies progress.
Foods and Cardiometabolic Health
Individual foods represent a complex matrix of fatty acids, 
proteins, carbohydrate quality, micronutrients, phyto-
chemicals, and preparation and processing methods that 
together modify cardiometabolic risk.9,141 Inference on the 
health effects of different foods is optimally derived from 
well-designed prospective observational and interven-
tional studies of clinical end points, together with support-
ive evidence from interventional studies of surrogate risk 
markers. Relevant mechanisms and pathways are further 
informed and elucidated by animal and experimental mod-
els. Cardiometabolic effects of different foods can be envi-
sioned along a spectrum of benefit versus harm (Figure 3): 
when considering the health effects of any food, it is impor-
tant to consider: compared with what?
Fruits, Nonstarchy Vegetables, Legumes, Nuts/Seeds 
Minimally processed, plant-derived foods such as fruits, 
nonstarchy vegetables, beans/legumes, and nuts/seeds are 
consistently linked to better cardiometabolic outcomes 
(Figure 6).142–145 These observed long-term benefits are sup-
ported by controlled trials of surrogate outcomes and clinical 
end points using dietary patterns rich in these foods.19–21 The 
effects of specific subtypes of these foods are less well estab-
lished. The foods richest in phytochemicals (eg, berries, nuts) 
appear to be particularly potent.
Starchy Vegetables
Potatoes are a widely consumed starchy vegetable. Although 
potatoes contain fiber, potassium, vitamins C and B6, and 
other trace minerals, they predominantly contain starch (long 
chains of glucose) that is rapidly digested in the mouth and 
stomach. This high-glucose load and rapid digestion would 
predict cardiometabolic harms, similar to white rice and white 
bread (see Carbohydrate-Rich Foods, below). Relatively few 
long-term studies have assessed potatoes and cardiometabolic 
outcomes. Among those that have, higher intake of potatoes, 
including boiled and baked potatoes, is prospectively linked 
to higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, whereas potatoes, 
corn, and peas are linked to greater long-term weight gain, 
in contrast to nonstarchy vegetables that are associated with 
protection against weight gain and diabetes mellitus.28,55,146,147 
Potatoes have also been cross-sectionally linked to greater 
diabetes mellitus, higher blood glucose, and lower HDL-
cholesterol,148 and, in retrospective studies, higher risk of 
stroke.149 Based on these concerns, russet/white potatoes are 
generally excluded from recommendations to increase veg-
etable consumption.
The long-term effects of other specific varieties of potatoes 
or other starchy vegetables are less established. Cassava is starch-
rich, similar to peeled potatoes, but the long-term cardiometa-
bolic effects remain uncertain150,151; glycemic responses may be 
ameliorated by its consumption in mixed meals. Similarly, the 
long-term health effects of yams, sweet potatoes, and parsnips 
(which each tend to contain relatively less starch relative to 
fiber compared with  russet or white potatoes), corn (which can 
be considered either a grain or vegetable), and peas (which is a 
legume) are not well established. In recent work, among major 
vegetables consumed in the United States, potatoes, corn, and 
peas were each associated with long-term weight gain, whereas 
other vegetable subtypes were each associated with weight loss.55
Based on high-starch content, greater glycemic responses, 
and some adverse long-term associations with clinical end-
points, high intakes of potatoes are not advisable. If con-
sumed, small portion sizes, including the (nutrient-rich) skin, 
and mixed meals (eg, mixed with healthful foods such as veg-
etable oils, fish, nonstarchy vegetables) would be prudent.
Carbohydrate-Rich Foods 
Carbohydrate-rich foods comprise about half or more of all 
calories in most diets globally. Although total carbohydrate 
consumption has little relation to cardiometabolic health, the 
quality of carbohydrate-rich foods is linked to risk (Figures 6 
and 7).152–160 Notably, the conventional chemistry-based clas-
sification of simple (sugar) versus complex (starch) carbohy-
drates has little physiological relevance, because saccharide 
chain length has little influence on digestion rate or metabolic 
effects of different carbohydrates. More meaningful charac-
teristics include dietary fiber content, glycemic responses to 
digestion, processing (intact, partially milled, fully milled, 
liquid), and whole-grain content.19
Each of these metrics can be altered relatively independently 
(Figure 8). Whole grains include endosperm (starch), bran 
(fiber, protein, B vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, tocopherols), 
and germ (protein, fatty acids, antioxidants, phytochemicals). 
When whole grains are intact (eg, quinoa) or partially intact (eg,

steel-cut oats, stone-ground bread), the bran protects the starchy 
endosperm from oral, gastric, and intestinal digestion, thereby 
reducing glycemic responses. In finely milled whole-grain 
products (eg, most whole-grain breads, breakfast cereals), the 
bran (fiber) and germ content remain similar, but the exposed 
endosperm can be rapidly digested, resulting in higher glyce-
mic responses. When the bran and germ are removed entirely 
(eg, refined grains: white bread, white rice, most cereals and 
crackers), only starchy endosperm remains, with high glycemic 
response and containing little fiber, minerals, or other nutrients. 
Some high-starch vegetables (eg, russet or white potatoes) have 
similar metabolic characteristics as refined grains (see Starchy 
Vegetables, below). Refined grains and high-starch vegetables 
are digested rapidly, with blood glucose and insulin responses 
that can be similar to simple sugars. Finally, sugars in liquid 
form (eg, soda, sports drinks, sweetened ice teas) appear even 
less satiating and more obesogenic than equivalent sugar in solid 
form (see Sugar-Sweetened Beverages, Noncaloric Sweeteners; 
and Carbohydrates, Added Sugars, Fructose; below).
Based on these effects, refined grains (starchy endosperm 
without the bran or germ), other starch-rich foods (eg, white 
potatoes), and added sugars appear to induce relatively similar 
cardiometabolic harms. When starch enters the mouth without 
the natural shelter of a whole-grain or fiber-rich food structure, 
oral amylase promptly initiates its breakdown into free glu-
cose, a process rapidly completed in the upper small intestine. 
Consequently, refined grains such as white bread, corn flakes, 
and rice; starchy foods such as russet or white potatoes; and 
pure table sugar all produce brisk rises in blood glucose and 
insulin (known as their glycemic index; or, when multiplied 
by portion size, as their glycemic load).161 This rapid digestion 
may induce multiple adverse effects, potentially stimulating 
reward/craving areas in the brain, activating hepatic de novo 
lipogenesis, increasing uric acid production, and promoting 
visceral adiposity.49,162–166 In addition, high glycemic load diets 
may even reduce total energy expenditure.50
In addition to direct harms, low-quality carbohydrates 
such as refined grains, certain potatoes, sugar-sweetened bev-
erages (SSBs), and sweets may increase cardiometabolic risk 
by displacing other, healthier foods in the diet, eg, fruits, veg-
etables, nuts, legumes, and minimally processed whole grains. 
Consistent with this constellation of adverse effects, poor-
quality carbohydrates are associated with long-term weight 
gain, diabetes mellitus, and CVD.29,89,158,167 Harms appear to be 
larger in women89,167 and others predisposed to insulin resis-
tance and atherogenic dyslipidemia, and smaller in men and in 
younger, lean individuals with high physical activity.
Based on their adverse effects and pervasiveness in mod-
ern diets, reducing refined grains, starches, and added sug-
ars is a major dietary priority for cardiometabolic health.21 
Although SSB intake is declining in the United States, intakes 
of added sugars in other foods and, even more so, of refined 
grains continue to represent a major part of the diet. Currently, 
nearly 3 in 4 Americans consume too many refined grain 
products.21 Indeed, many people seek out these products, erro-
neously believing they are beneficial based on their promo-
tion as low-fat or fat-free foods. Recognizing this pervasive 
confusion, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
specified that, “consumption of ‘low-fat’ or ‘nonfat’ products 
with high amounts of refined grains and added sugars should 
be discouraged.”21 Because of the multiple independent char-
acteristics that influence carbohydrate quality (eg, fiber, gly-
cemic response, processing, whole-grain content), no single 
criterion appears perfect for distinguishing carbohydrate-rich 
foods. Among several recommended metrics, a ratio of total 
carbohydrate to dietary fiber (g/serving) of <10:1 is a helpful 
practical guide to identify more healthful grain choices.168,169
Meats 
Similar to many other foods, guidelines on meat consumption 
in cardiometabolic health were historically based on mini-
mally adjusted ecological comparisons and theorized effects 
of isolated nutrient content (eg, saturated fat, dietary choles-
terol). However, modern evidence supports relatively neutral 
cardiovascular effects of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol 
and more relevant effects of other compounds in meats, such 
as heme iron, sodium, and other preservatives (see Nutrients 
and Cardiometabolic Health, below).
Consistent with these findings, although a minority of 
individual studies suggest similar cardiovascular risk for 
unprocessed red meat versus processed meats,170,171 many 
other individual studies and meta-analyses support a much 
stronger effect of processed meats, including low-fat deli 
meats, on CVD (Figure 6).172–174 Based on the observed 
effect sizes and relationships seen with other, noncardiovas-
cular outcomes, residual confounding could explain some 
or all of the observed modest associations of unprocessed 
red meat with CVD.175 In contrast, the observed association 
of processed meats with CVD is quite plausible: much of it 
can be explained merely by the predicted effects of the high 
levels of sodium (~400% higher in processed meats) on BP 
levels and the subsequent effects of this elevated BP on clini-
cal endpoints.176 Diet-microbiome interactions may also play 
a role,177 although such interactions would predict similar or 
stronger risk for unprocessed red meats than processed meats, 
when in fact the reverse is seen in many populations.
Interestingly, both red and processed meats, regardless of 
fat content, are linked to a higher incidence of diabetes mel-
litus, although with approximately double the risk, gram-for-
gram, for processed meats than for unprocessed red meats.172,178 
Mechanisms require further study, but this observed risk for dia-
betes mellitus may be linked to iron content179,180 and possibly 
lipid and amino acid metabolites, advanced glycation end prod-
ucts, trimethylamine N-oxide, and nitrates/nitrites.181,182
In sum, these findings provide little support for conven-
tional guidelines to choose meats based on fat content, ie to 
focus on selecting lower-fat or lean meats. Rather, it would be 
prudent to consume small amounts of unprocessed red meats 
(eg, 1–2 servings/wk) to obtain readily bioavailable iron and 
zinc, while minimizing or entirely avoiding processed meats 
such as bacon, sausage, salami, and low-fat processed deli 
meats (chicken, turkey, pork, roast beef).183
Differences in bovine feeding systems can influence nutri-
ent contents of meats. For example, in comparison with grain, 
grass feeding results in less intramuscular fat and therefore, 
when visible (extramuscular) fat is trimmed away, higher 
contents of omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, conjugated linoleic 
acid, and vitamins A and E, and lower contents of saturated, 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 200  Circulation  January 12, 2016
monounsaturated, and trans-18:1 fats.184,185 However, although 
grass feeding consistently increases the relative proportions 
(as a percent age of total fatty acids) of omega-3 fats, the abso-
lute content (g per 100 g beef) can be the same, higher, or even 
lower because of decreased total fat content of the meat.184,185 
Thus, the health implications of grass feeding and these mod-
est nutrient differences require further study.
Poultry, Eggs 
Relatively few studies have focused on poultry as a risk factor 
for CVD or diabetes mellitus, with few systematic reviews or 
meta-analyses (Figure 6).174 In several large studies, poultry is 
not significantly associated with CVD events;174,186–189 and in 
other cohorts, with modestly lower risk of CVD, with smaller 
observed benefits than seen for fish, nuts, or legumes.52,53 Large

 Mozaffarian  Dietary and Policy Priorities  201
studies evaluating poultry and incident diabetes mellitus have 
shown mixed results including higher risk, no risk, and lower 
risk.178,190–195 These conflicting findings do not permit a strong 
inference on the cardiometabolic effects of poultry.
Egg consumption has no significant association with inci-
dent CVD in general populations (Figure 6).196,197 Conversely, 
eggs may influence and interact with diabetes mellitus.197 
Frequent consumers (7+ eggs/wk) have higher new-onset dia-
betes mellitus; and among patients with prevalent diabetes 
mellitus, frequent consumers experience more clinical CVD 
events. On the other hand, higher egg consumption is associ-
ated with lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke,196 potentially related 
to the protective effects of dietary cholesterol on vascular fra-
gility.198,199 As with poultry, the relevance of these conflicting 
findings remains uncertain. Overall evidence suggests small 
cardiometabolic effects of occasional consumption (eg, up to 
2–3 eggs/wk); and possible harm with frequent consumption, 
especially among diabetics patients. Of note, the 2015 Dietary 
Guidelines Advisory Committee concluded that dietary choles-
terol is not a “nutrient of concern for overconsumption,”21 based 
on low mean population cholesterol intake and no appreciable 
relationships between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol 
or clinical cardiovascular events in general populations.21a
In sum, occasional consumption of poultry and eggs 
appears relatively neutral for cardiometabolic health, with-
out strong evidence for either risks or benefits. Until more 
evidence is generated, it may be prudent to consider these 
foods as healthful alternatives to harmful foods (eg, processed 
meats, refined grains, sugars) and yet as relatively unhealthy 
alternatives in comparison with beneficial foods (eg, fish, nuts, 
legumes, fruits).
Fish 
The cardiovascular effects of fish and omega-3 consumption 
have been studied for decades. In comparison with little or 
no consumption, moderate consumption of fish (≈2+ servings/
wk) and long-chain omega-3 (≈250 mg/d) associates with 
lower risk of fatal CHD (Figures 6 and 7).200–202 In contrast, 
higher intakes do not appear to appreciably reduce risk fur-
ther. In comparison with fatal cardiac events, fish consump-
tion has weaker associations with nonfatal cardiac events and 
with stroke.201,203,204 The specificity for fatal CHD, rather than 
all CVD events, suggests that this association may not be fully 
explained by residual confounding. This finding is also con-
sistent with meta-analyses of randomized fish oil trials that 
demonstrate risk reductions for cardiac death, but not total 
CVD, CHD, or stroke.109 However, these latter pooled results 
obscure the differences in results of individual randomized tri-
als over time: 4 of 5 earlier trials, yet none of several newer 
trials, demonstrate benefits.205 These discrepant results could 
be attributable to more aggressive lipid- and BP-lowering 
drug treatment in recent trials. Alternatively, because the 
dose-response effect of omega-3’s for fatal CHD appears 
nonlinear,200,201 higher background intakes of fish among sub-
jects enrolled in more recent trials may have diminished the 
ability to detect any benefits of adding fish oil.205 Additional 
clinical trials of fish oil supplements are ongoing,206 but may 
not be adequately powered to evaluate fatal (rather than total) 
CHD or subgroups with low fish intake, for whom the benefits 
appear most plausible.
Notably, in meta-analyses of multiple controlled interven-
tions, fish and omega-3 consumption improve major physiolog-
ical risk factors for CVD including BP, heart rate, endothelial 
function, triglycerides, and adiponectin.201,205 Omega-3s also 
reduce inflammatory biomarkers, reduce myocardial oxygen 
use, and enhance cardiac function.201,205 Overall, although the 
null results of recent fish oil trials are concerning, the cumula-
tive evidence from observational studies, clinical trials, and 
controlled interventional studies continues to favor plausible 
cardiovascular benefits of modest dietary fish consumption, in 
particular for the endpoint of CHD death. Based on conflict-
ing findings from recent trials, fish oil supplementation has 
uncertain benefits but an excellent safety profile and may be

considered as an adjunct to fish intake or for high-risk patients 
who do not eat fish.
The effects of fish consumption on other vascular con-
ditions including stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, 
and cognitive decline remain unclear, with conflicting find-
ings.201,203,207,208 Fish and omega-3 intake also have little asso-
ciation with the risk for diabetes mellitus, although protective 
associations are seen in Asian populations209–211 and fish oil 
supplementation modestly raises adiponectin.212 Types of 
fish consumed and preparation methods may influence car-
diometabolic effects, with greatest benefits perhaps obtained 
from nonfried, dark-meat (oily) fish that contain up to 10-fold 
higher omega-3 fatty acids than white-meat fish.201
Growing evidence suggests that the presence of persistent 
organic pollutants (eg, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls) may 
partly reduce cardiometabolic benefits of fish consumption213–215; 
less evidence suggests a potential for net harm, due to the coun-
tervailing benefits of omega-3s. Methylmercury consumed from 
fish has no detectable influence on incident cardiovascular events, 
hypertension, or diabetes mellitus.216–218 To optimize neurodevel-
opment in their children attributable to the benefits of fish con-
sumption, women who are or may become pregnant or nursing 
should follow US Food and Drug Administration guidance to eat 
2 to 3 servings/wk of a variety of fish lower in mercury, while 
avoiding only selected specific species (Gulf of Mexico tilefish, 
shark, swordfish, king mackerel; albacore tuna up to 6 oz/wk).219
While patients often ask about health effects of farmed 
(aquaculture) versus wild-caught species, few species are com-
monly available as both: most are either predominantly farmed 
(eg, tilapia, catfish, carp, shrimp, oysters) or wild-caught (eg, 
tuna, pollock, crab, cod).220 One exception is salmon, of which 
about one-third are wild-caught (principally from Alaska) 
and two-thirds are farmed (eg, from Norway, Chile). Because 
farmed salmon are fed, while wild salmon hunt for their food, 
farmed salmon have similar or higher levels of omega-3 fatty 
acids201 and likely similar net health benefits.200
Milk, Cheese, Yogurt 
The cardiometabolic effects of different dairy foods represent 
a major unanswered question of modern nutrition science. 
Most dietary guidelines simply group different types together 
(eg, grouping milk, cheese, and yogurt as “dairy”), categorize 
these by fat content, and then recommend selection of low-fat 
products.21 Such recommendations largely derive from theo-
retical considerations about selected single nutrients (calcium, 
vitamin D, calories, saturated fat), rather than empirical evi-
dence on health effects of the actual foods.
In longitudinal studies evaluating habitual intakes of dairy 
foods, relationships with CVD and diabetes mellitus do not 
consistently differ by fat content but appear more specific to 
food type: eg, cheese, yogurt, milk, butter (Figure 6).57,221–226 
For example, the intake of yogurt, but not milk, is consistently 
associated with lower incidence of diabetes mellitus, whereas 
the intake of cheese, which has high calorie, fat, and satu-
rated fat content, is also associated with lower diabetes risk 
in several although not all studies.57,179–184,224,226–228 Although 
total milk intake is generally unassociated with diabetes mel-
litus, fermented milk is linked to lower risk,57,227,229 suggesting 
a potential influence of fermentation, particularly in light of 
the separate findings for cheese. Bacterial cultures used for 
fermentation can synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinones), 
which may improve insulin sensitivity.230,231 These findings 
suggest that the health effects of dairy may depend on mul-
tiple complex characteristics, eg, probiotics in yogurt, fermen-
tation of cheese. The metabolic effects of specific dairy foods 
and fermented products represent promising areas for further 
investigation.
In short-term randomized trials, adding milk or dairy to 
energy-restricted diets increases lean mass and reduces body 
fat, whereas no significant body compositional effects are seen 
when adding dairy to ad libitum diets.232,233 Long-term effects 
may vary by the type of dairy. For instance, children who drink 
more low-fat milk gain more weight, whereas those who drink 
more whole-fat milk gain less weight, over time.62–66 In lon-
gitudinal studies among adults, neither low-fat nor whole-fat 
milk are appreciably related to chronic weight gain.28,29,51 This 
lack of difference may relate to caloric compensation: when 
adults consume more low-fat dairy, they compensate in the 
long term by increasing their consumption of carbohydrates.29
The STRIP trial randomly assigned 1062 Finnish infants 
to dietary intervention versus control, with follow-up for up to 
20 years. For the first 3 years, the intervention focused on low-
ering total fat and saturated fat, while also increasing unsatu-
rated fats from canola oil, other vegetable oils, and fish. At 3 
years, no differences were seen in body weight, even among 
children most compliant with the low-fat diet.234 Subsequently, 
the intervention group received comprehensive dietary coun-
seling, including to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, 
reduce salt intake, replace refined grains/cereals with whole 
grains, increase dietary fiber, increase fruits and vegetables, 
avoid smoking, and be physically active.235 The control group 
received only basic health education. Unsurprisingly, this 
comprehensive lifestyle advice, in comparison with no inter-
vention, improved metabolic health.235 These results provide 
little inference on the specific effects of lowering saturated fat 
or dairy fat among children.
The impact of cheese consumption on long-term weight 
may vary depending on how it is consumed: more weight gain 
is seen when cheese is accompanied by refined carbohydrates, 
and less weight gain or even relative weight loss when cheese 
replaces refined carbohydrates.29 Yogurt appears protective 
against long-term weight gain,28,29,51 although when sugar-
sweetened, approximately half the benefit appears lost.29 
Animal-experimental studies and trials in humans suggest that 
probiotics and probiotic-microbiome interactions play a key 
role in the protective effects of yogurt, both for obesity and 
related conditions such as gestational diabetes.52–54,236–241
Interestingly, dairy fat itself may promote cardiometabolic 
health. In cohorts using objective blood biomarkers, greater 
dairy fat consumption is associated with a lower incidence of 
diabetes mellitus59–61,242,243 and CHD,39,244,245 and with mixed 
findings for stroke.246 It remains unclear whether such find-
ings relate to health benefits of specific dairy fatty acids (eg, 
branched-chain fatty acids, medium-chain saturated fats, spe-
cific ruminant trans fats), other lipid-soluble factors in dairy 
fat, other factors in high-fat dairy foods (eg, production of 
vitamin K2 from fermentation of cheese), or unknown endog-
enous (nondietary) determinants of these blood biomarkers.247

 Mozaffarian  Dietary and Policy Priorities  203
Whatever the explanation, little evidence supports the oppos-
ing hypothesis, ie, the superiority of low-fat dairy products for 
health, including for risk of obesity.
In sum, dairy products represent a diverse class of foods, 
with complex effects that vary by specific product type and 
with emerging mechanistic pathways that appear to include 
influences of fermentation and probiotics. No long-term stud-
ies support harms, and emerging evidence suggests some 
potential benefits, of dairy fat or high-fat dairy foods such as 
cheese. Together these findings provide little support for the 
prevailing recommendations for dairy intake that are based 
largely on calcium and vitamin D contents, rather than com-
plete cardiometabolic effects; that emphasize low-fat dairy 
based on theorized influences on obesity and CHD, rather than 
empirical evidence; or that consider dairy as a single category, 
rather than separately evaluating different dairy foods. The 
current science supports consuming more yogurt and possi-
bly cheese; with the choice between low-fat versus whole-fat 
being personal preference, pending further investigation. This 
new evidence also calls for substantial further investment in 
research on cardiometabolic effects of dairy foods, including 
relevant components and molecular mechanisms.
Butter 
In a large pooling project of European cohorts, individuals 
consuming any butter, in comparison with none, experienced 
a lower risk of diabetes mellitus.248 However, among butter 
consumers, no further dose-response was seen, suggesting 
potential for reverse causation (bias) among nonconsum-
ers. In either case, these findings would suggest that butter 
is, at worst, neutral for diabetes mellitus. Butter consump-
tion is also not significantly associated with incident CHD,223 
stroke,222 or total mortality58 (Figure 6). Remarkably few stud-
ies have reported on these relationships, suggesting potential 
for publication bias. Because such bias would skew toward 
the reporting of large associations, the absence of significant 
associations in published reports makes it implausible that 
multiple other studies have identified but not reported harmful 
relationships. Increases in butter consumption are associated 
with modestly greater long-term weight gain.29 In sum, but-
ter appears relatively neutral for cardiometabolic health, con-
sistent with findings for total saturated fat (see Saturated Fat, 
below); and slightly adverse for long-term weight regulation.
Vegetable Oils
The cardiometabolic effects of vegetable oils have convention-
ally been considered in light of their fatty acid composition, ie, 
of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fats (see sec-
tions on each of these fats, below). Emerging evidence suggests 
that health effects may also relate to other constituents, in particu-
lar, flavonoid (phenolic) compounds (see Phenolic Compounds, 
below).30,249–252 For instance, extra virgin olive oil contains oleo-
canthal, a phenolic that binds cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 
receptors (causing a characteristic burning throat sensation, simi-
lar to that induced by chewing no coated aspirin) and exhibits 
anti-inflammatory properties.30,251,252 In the PREDIMED random-
ized trial, participants receiving extra virgin olive oil and dietary 
advice to consume a Mediterranean diet experienced 30% lower 
risk of stroke, MI, or death, in comparison with control.34 In the 
intervention group, ≈60% of the extra virgin olive oil simply 
replaced regular olive oil, commonly used in Spain. These find-
ings, together with mixed evidence for cardiovascular benefits of 
monounsaturated fats21 (see below), which represent most of the 
fats in olive oil, suggest that fatty acid profiles may not be the 
only relevant determinant of health effects of oils.
Little investigation has been done on the long-term health 
effects of tropical oils, such as palm or coconut. These oils 
contain saturated fat, but also other compounds, eg, medium-
chain fatty acids in coconut oil that could have health ben-
efits.253 Modern nutritional science has demonstrated the 
limitations of drawing conclusions about health effects of any 
food product based on theories about its nutrient contents.9 
Thus, long-term investigations are urgently needed to make 
evidence-informed decisions about avoiding or increasing the 
use of tropical oils. Industrially interesterified oils are increas-
ingly common, but similarly without long-term evidence on 
their health effects or safety.254
Based on overall evidence for cardiometabolic effects, the 
current evidence supports generally increased consumption of 
vegetable oils in place of refined grains, starches, sugars, meats, 
butter, and lard. Among different oils, the benefits of soybean, 
extra virgin olive, and canola oil may be best established. Virgin 
oils (eg, extra virgin olive oil, virgin soybean oil) may be pref-
erable because of their low-temperature refining that may bet-
ter preserve trace phenolic compounds; further study of how 
processing methods of vegetable oils influence phytochemicals 
and health effects is needed. In the future, certain vegetable oil 
blends may offer particular cardiometabolic benefits, eg, com-
bining flax and safflower oils, or canola oil and omega-3 fatty 
acids.255 Sufficient evidence to support strong promotion or 
avoidance of tropical oils is lacking. Additional metabolic and 
long-term studies of different specific vegetable oils, including 
refined and unrefined versions, are urgently needed.
SSBs, Noncaloric Sweeteners
Both long-term prospective cohorts and clinical trials dem-
onstrate that SSBs increase adiposity.256 Per serving, SSBs 
associate with greater long-term weight gain than nearly any 
other dietary factor.28 These effects are likely attributable to 
their high glycemic and insulin responses and low satiation 
(see Carbohydrate-Rich Foods, above). SSBs are also associ-
ated with increased incidence of diabetes mellitus and CHD 
(Figure 6).257,258 These effects appear partly but not entirely 
mediated by adiposity, consistent with independent adverse 
effects of SSBs on other pathways such as hepatic de novo 
lipogenesis, visceral fat accumulation, and uric acid produc-
tion (see Carbohydrate, Added Sugars, Fructose, below). 
Globally, SSB consumption is highest at younger ages,259 
boding poorly for long-term global health if such high intake 
continues as these populations age. Worldwide, 184 000 car-
diometabolic deaths per year are estimated to be attributable 
to SSB consumption.260
With growing policy attention on sugar-sweetened bever-
ages and added sugars, the food industry is increasingly seek-
ing low-calorie and noncaloric alternatives.261 These include 
artificial sweeteners (eg, saccharin, sucralose, aspartame) and 
natural low-calorie (also termed high-intensity or nonnutri-
tive) sweeteners (eg, stevia). Based on long-term observa-
tional studies and intermediate-duration (eg, 2 years) clinical 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 204  Circulation  January 12, 2016
trials,28,256 these appear to be better alternatives than sugar 
for people who consume large quantities of SSBs. However, 
based on animal experiments and limited human data, these 
artificial and nonnutritive sweeteners may not be benign, with 
potential for impact on cognitive processes (eg, reward, taste 
perception), oral-gastrointestinal taste receptors, glucose-
insulin and energy homeostasis, metabolic hormones, and the 
gut microbiome.262–265 Cognitive effects, for example, may be 
especially relevant in children: if tastes become accustomed to 
such intense sweetness, will palates and attraction be reduced 
for naturally sweet, healthful foods such as apples or carrots? 
In sum, based on limited available evidence, artificial and non-
nutritive sweeteners appear to be a useful intermediate step 
to reduce harms of SSBs (eg, to switch from regular to diet 
soda) but should subsequently also be reduced (eg, to switch 
from diet soda to seltzer water) to prevent potential long-term 
harms. Other uses of such sweeteners should not yet be con-
sidered innocuous for cardiometabolic health.
100% Fruit Juice
Although SSB and 100% fruit juice have similar sugar con-
tent, the latter is linked to relatively smaller long-term weight 
gain.28 Furthermore, the intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice, 
but not 100% fruit juice, is associated with incident diabetes 
mellitus in longitudinal studies (Figure 6).257,266 These find-
ings suggest that 100% fruit juice may have other beneficial 
components, eg, dietary fiber, vitamins, and phytochemicals, 
that at least partly offset any harms. In short-term trials, fruit 
juice has no appreciable effects on blood pressure, cholesterol 
levels, or glucose-insulin homeostasis.267,268 In sum, moderate 
intake of 100% juice (eg, up to one serving/d) appears reason-
able, especially given the low intakes of whole fruit in most 
populations; higher intake of 100% juice may not be prudent 
because of links to long-term weight gain.
Coffee, Tea 
While coffee is commonly thought of in relation to its caf-
feine content, it represents a liquid extract of legumes (coffee 
beans) that contains many active compounds. Both caffein-
ated and decaffeinated coffee are associated with lower onset 
of diabetes mellitus in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 6).269 
Coffee intake also is associated with lower risk of CHD and 
stroke but in a nonlinear fashion: in comparison with no 
intake, the lowest risk is seen at 3 to 4 cups/d, with increasing 
risk at higher intakes.270 Several small controlled trials have 
evaluated the potential effects of habitual coffee consumption 
on cardiometabolic risk factors, with mixed and inconsistent 
findings to date.271–273 A Mendelian randomization study, 
evaluating genetic variants linked to coffee intake, did not 
find associations with any cardiovascular or metabolic risk 
factors.274
Similar to coffee consumption, tea consumption is associ-
ated with a lower risk of diabetes mellitus and CVD, especially 
comparing very frequent consumption (3–4 cups/d) with none 
(Figure 6).275,276 Yet, controlled trials of tea have not identi-
fied robust benefits on markers of glucose-insulin homeosta-
sis.277,278 In comparison, in meta-analyses of trials, green tea, 
black tea, and herbal roselle tea each modestly lower BP,279–281 
whereas green and black tea, but not herbal roselle tea, also 
lower LDL-cholesterol.282–284
Overall, observational studies support potential cardio-
metabolic benefits of both coffee and tea. Plausible biological 
mechanisms that could explain the size of these associations 
have not been confirmed, with the exception perhaps for tea 
and cardiovascular risk. Based on current data, tea and coffee 
do not increase cardiometabolic risk and can be safely con-
sumed, and green and black tea may reduce cardiovascular 
risk. Further research on these potential benefits is needed 
before actively encouraging consumption as a means to 
reduce risk.
Alcohol 
Habitual heavy alcohol use causes up to one-third of nonisch-
emic dilated cardiomyopathy in many nations.285 Ventricular 
dysfunction is often irreversible, even when alcohol use is 
stopped; while continued drinking is associated with high 
mortality. Habitual alcohol and acute binges are associated 
with higher risk of atrial fibrillation.286 Like other liquid 
calories (with the exception of milk), alcohol intake also is 
associated with higher long-term weight gain.287 Conversely, 
in comparison with nondrinkers, regular moderate alcohol 
consumption – up to ≈2 drinks per day for men, ≈1 to 1.5 
drink per day for women – is associated with lower incidence 
of CHD and diabetes mellitus, although not stroke.288,289 Such 
observational analyses could partly overestimate benefits, 
because never drinkers could include those who have avoided 
alcohol because of unmeasured factors that relate to later poor 
health.290 Yet, magnitudes and consistency of observed lower 
risks of CHD and diabetes across diverse populations, together 
with favorable effects on HDL-cholesterol, insulin resistance, 
and fibrinogen in controlled trials,291 provide strong evidence 
for at least some cardiometabolic benefit of moderate alco-
hol use. Although a common perception is that the effects are 
specific to red wine, cardiometabolic benefits have also been 
seen for white wine, beer, and spirits.292 This could relate to 
the physiological effects of alcohol itself,291 or the phenolics 
in wine and beer, as well.292
Alcohol use exhibits a “J-shape” with all-cause mortality, 
with lowest risk observed between 1 drink/wk and 1 drink/d, 
and higher risk thereafter.289 In addition, the pattern of drink-
ing is important: benefits are seen with moderate use across 
multiple days per week, not with high levels on a few days.293 
Across the population, alcohol produces net harms because of 
the increased risk of cancers, liver disease, cardiomyopathy, 
accidents, violence, homicides, and suicides.1,294 Thus, alcohol 
intake should not be recommended as a means to reduce CVD 
risk. Adults who already drink alcohol should be advised to 
limit their use to moderate levels.
Nutrients and Cardiometabolic Health
Phenolic Compounds 
Bioactive polyphenols include flavonols (eg, in onions, broc-
coli, tea, various fruits), flavones (in parsley, celery, chamo-
mile tea), flavanones (in citrus fruits), flavanols (flavan-3-ols) 
such as catechins and procyanidins (in cocoa, apples, grapes, 
red wine, tea), anthocyanidins (in colored berries), and iso-
flavones (in soy). In laboratory studies and randomized trials, 
flavonoid-rich cocoa has small but measurable benefits on BP, 
endothelial function, insulin resistance, and blood lipids.295–297 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 Mozaffarian  Dietary and Policy Priorities  205
BP-lowering occurs with as little as 6.3 g/d (30 kcal/d) of 
commercial dark chocolate and correlates with increased 
endothelial nitric oxide production.298 The latter mechanism 
also suggests potential cardiovascular benefits beyond lower 
BP per se. A few short-term trials of other dietary sources (eg, 
tea, red wine, grapes) or specific flavonoid extracts have not 
consistently improved BP, lipid levels, or endothelial func-
tion.295–297 Some observational studies evaluating total or 
selected dietary flavonoids observe lower risk of cardiometa-
bolic events299,300; no long-term clinical trials have been per-
formed. The remarkable heterogeneity of different flavonoids 
and their dietary sources limits inference for class effects, and 
clinical benefits and dose-responses are not well-established. 
Yet, many foods with growing evidence for cardiometabolic 
benefits – eg, berries,301 nuts,145 extra virgin olive oil34 – are 
rich in phenolics, and the documented physiological effects 
are promising and provide clear impetus for further study.
Sodium 
In North America and Europe, most sodium (≈75%) comes 
from packaged foods and restaurants, and a minority from 
home cooking or table salt; whereas in Asian countries, most 
sodium comes from soy sauce and salt added during cooking 
or at the table.302 Nearly every country in the world exceeds 
the recommended mean national intake of 2000 mg/d.303
Sodium raises BP in a dose-dependent fashion, with 
stronger effects among older individuals, people who have 
hypertension, and blacks.304 In meta-analyses of longitudinal 
studies, high sodium intakes are associated with incident total 
stroke, stroke mortality, and CHD mortality (Figure 7).305–307 
This is supported by the strength of BP as a surrogate out-
come308 and by ecological and experimental studies of sodium 
and CVD.304 Indeed, the latter studies suggest that chronically 
high sodium induces additional, BP-independent damage to 
renal, myocardial, and vascular tissues.309,310
Nearly all observational studies demonstrate a positive 
association between very high sodium intakes (eg, 4000+ 
mg/d) and CVD events, in particular stroke.305–307 Some stud-
ies have also observed a potential J-shaped relationship, with 
increased CVD risk at modest intakes (eg, <3000 g/d).311–313 
These findings have generated recent controversy about the 
optimal lowest levels of sodium consumption.314
The assessment of sodium in observational studies, whether 
by urine spot, 24-hour collection, or diet questionnaire, has 
unique potential biases.315 These include potential for incom-
plete 24-hour urine collections (leading to underestimation of 
sodium intake, especially in less compliant, sicker individuals); 
reverse causation (ie, due to at-risk subjects, such as those with 
higher BP or diabetes mellitus, actively lowering their sodium 
intake); confounding by physical activity (which increases total 
energy consumption, that then increases total sodium intake316); 
and confounding by frailty and other reasons for low total energy 
consumption (given the very strong correlation between sodium 
and total energy consumption). These limitations together could 
explain the J-shapes seen in certain observational studies.
In comparison, during extended surveillance in a large 
sodium study that excluded sick individuals at baseline and 
collected multiple 24-hour urine samples per subject, mini-
mizing the potential influence of these biases, participants 
with lowest intakes (<2300 mg/d) experienced 32% lower 
CVD risk than those consuming high intakes, with evidence 
for linearly decreasing risk.317 In ecological studies, the lowest 
mean intake level associated with both lower systolic BP and a 
lower rise in BP with aging is 614 mg/d.318 In randomized con-
trolled feeding trials, BP reductions have been documented 
down to intakes of 1500 mg/d.319 In meta-analyses of prospec-
tive observational studies, the lowest mean intakes associated 
with lower risk of CVD events ranged from 1787 to 2391 
mg/d.305 Together, these findings support the recommended 
target intakes in current national and international dietary 
guidelines, which range from 1200 to 2400 mg/d.110,313,320–323
Although large reductions in sodium can increase renin-
aldosterone and serum triglyceride levels,324 the effects of 
more moderate, gradual reductions on these pathways are not 
established. It also remains unclear whether such physiologi-
cal effects could offset, let alone reverse, the BP-lowering 
benefits of sodium reduction in order to explain the J-shaped 
relations with CVD risk seen in some observational studies. 
Overall, although adverse effects of rapid sodium reduction 
cannot be excluded, and true optimal lower limits remain 
uncertain, the sum of evidence suggests that optimal levels of 
sodium intake are ≈2000 mg/d193,200–204 (or lower).304 Based on 
a target consumption level of 2000 mg/d, 1.65 million annual 
global cardiovascular deaths are estimated to be attributable to 
excess sodium intake.304
Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium 
Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and dairy are 
major sources of minerals. In randomized trials, potassium 
lowers BP, with stronger effects among individuals who have 
hypertension and when dietary sodium intake is high.325 This 
BP lowering has been correlated with both increased urinary 
potassium excretion and a lower urine sodium-to-potassium 
ratio. Consistent with these benefits, potassium-rich diets 
are associated with lower risk of CVD, especially stroke 
(Figure 7).326 Diets rich in potassium also attenuate, whereas 
diets low in potassium exacerbate, the BP-raising effects of 
sodium. For instance, a Mediterranean or DASH-type diet (eg, 
richer in fruits, vegetables, nuts) reduces, whereas a typical 
Western diet increases, the BP-raising effects of sodium.326,327 
In sum, the evidence strongly supports the importance of 
potassium-rich foods for reducing BP and CVD.
In short-term trials, calcium and magnesium supplements 
also modestly lower BP, although with substantial heteroge-
neity among studies. However, calcium supplements with or 
without vitamin D may significantly increase risk of MI in 
long-term randomized trials.328,329 In observational analyses, 
dietary and blood magnesium levels are inversely associated 
with CVD, especially fatal CHD330; long-term trials have not 
been performed. Calcium and magnesium supplements cannot 
yet be recommended for general CVD prevention.
Antioxidant Vitamins 
Several vitamins and nutrients are associated with lower CVD 
risk in observational studies, but trials of supplements, including 
folate, B vitamins, β-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and sele-
nium, have shown no significant effects on atherosclerosis pro-
gression or CVD events.19,331,332 Most of these trials, for reasons 
of power, evaluated up to a few years of treatment in patients

 206  Circulation  January 12, 2016
with established CVD or at high risk. In contrast, most observa-
tional studies evaluated long-term or habitual intake among gen-
erally healthy populations. Thus, discrepancies in findings could 
relate in part to different time periods of biological sensitivity 
— eg, some vitamins and nutrients could be important only early 
in the disease course. Such explanations require confirmation in 
prospective studies and trials. Discrepancies between observa-
tional studies and supplement trials may also relate to residual 
bias in observational studies, eg from other lifestyle behaviors 
(ie, observed benefits are not attributable to diet) or from other 
nutritional factors in vitamin-rich foods (ie, observed benefits 
are caused by diet but not by the specific measured vitamins 
or nutrients). For example, diets higher in antioxidant vitamins 
tend to be rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains, foods 
that contain multiple other beneficial factors including other 
vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and fiber, and being foods 
that can provide benefit by replacing unhealthful foods, as well. 
Thus, isolating one or even several components of these foods 
in a supplement may not produce similar effects as would occur 
from consuming the whole food.8,9
Vitamin D 
Observational studies demonstrate links between higher 
plasma vitamin D, which is largely driven by sun exposure, 
and CVD risk; however, large trials of vitamin D supplements 
have shown no benefits.104 If higher plasma vitamin D proves 
to lower CVD risk, brief sun exposure can efficiently provide 
such levels in comparison with dietary intake. Ongoing trials 
are now testing whether higher doses of vitamin D supple-
ments influence CVD; for now, such supplementation is not 
warranted as a means to improve cardiometabolic health.
Carbohydrates, Added Sugars, Fructose 
For decades, carbohydrates were considered a foundation of 
a healthful diet, as evidenced by the placement of grain prod-
ucts at the base of the 1992 Food Guide Pyramid. Since that 
time, it has become clear that, although total carbohydrate 
has little influence on cardiometabolic health, the types and 
quality of carbohydrate have a major impact (Figures 6 and 7; 
see Carbohydrate-Rich Foods, above). Certain carbohydrate-
containing foods (eg, fruits, legumes, vegetables, minimally 
processed whole grains) are protective, whereas foods rich in 
refined grains (eg, white bread, white rice, crackers, cereals, 
bakery desserts), starches (eg, russet or white potatoes), and 
added sugars (eg, SSBs, candy) are harmful. Because of this 
diversity, the cardiometabolic effects of total carbohydrate 
are modified by the quality of carbohydrate. For people who 
consume mostly low-fiber, rapidly digested, refined grains, 
starches, and added sugars, a lowering of total carbohydrate 
will produce substantial metabolic benefits. Yet, recommend-
ing a low-carbohydrate diet per se is not ideal: the focus 
should be on reducing less healthful carbohydrates, not all 
carbohydrates.
The US Food and Drug Administration has recently pro-
posed revising the Nutrition Facts Panel to include added 
sugars.333 Although added sugars are not healthful, targeting 
added sugars alone, rather than overall carbohydrate quality, 
could push consumers toward foods low in added sugars but 
rich in equally harmful refined complex carbohydrates (eg, 
many breakfast cereals, breads, crackers); and away from 
otherwise healthful foods containing modest amounts of 
added sugar (eg, nuts or minimally processed whole grain–
rich cereals sweetened with honey). Appropriately, the 2015 
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee explicitly advises 
restriction of both refined grains and added sugars.21
Much public attention has focused on the potential harms 
of high-fructose corn syrup. Because glucose, the main sugar 
in regular corn syrup (which is mostly starch), tastes less 
sweet than fructose, high-fructose corn syrup has been modi-
fied to increase the fructose-to-glucose ratio to about 1:1, ie, a 
similar ratio as in natural sugar (sucrose) found in cane sugar, 
beet sugar, or honey. Consequently, there are few expected or 
observed physiological or health differences between high-
fructose corn syrup versus sucrose.165,166,334 In contrast, there 
are important metabolic differences between glucose and fruc-
tose – each equally present in both high-fructose corn syrup 
and natural sugar (sucrose). In particular, high doses of rapidly 
digested glucose induce postprandial hyperglycemia, hyperin-
sulinemia, and related metabolic disturbances. When glyco-
gen stores are replete, excess glucose is further converted to 
fat via hepatic de novo lipogenesis. In comparison, high doses 
of rapidly digested fructose have little influence on blood glu-
cose or insulin levels, but more directly stimulate hepatic de 
novo lipogenesis, hepatic and visceral adiposity, and uric acid 
production.164–166 Thus, high doses of rapidly digested glucose 
and fructose are each harmful, with such effects occurring via 
both separate and partly overlapping pathways. In contrast, 
low doses of slowly digested glucose or fructose (eg, as found 
in fruit) would each have minimal cardiometabolic harms. 
Ultimately, the health differences between high-fructose corn 
syrup versus natural added sugar are small in comparison with 
their overall dose, rapidity of digestion, and accompanying 
nutrients in the foods in which they are consumed.
Total Fat
In 1980, the US Dietary Guidelines recommended limit-
ing dietary fat to <30% of calories. Based on evidence for 
harms of very low-fat diets, and little evidence to support a 
30% restriction, the Guidelines were moderated in 2005 to a 
new range of 20% to 35% of calories.335 A primary motivation 
for restricting total fat was to lower saturated fat and dietary 
cholesterol because of concern that these increased cardiovas-
cular risk. Thus, total fat was targeted as a means to lower 
saturated fat. In addition, based on the calorie density of fat 
and some limited interventional studies, it was theorized that 
low-fat diets might help prevent obesity.335 Unfortunately, the 
focus on restricting total fat did not account for the health ben-
efits of high intakes of plant-derived fats (see Nuts, Vegetable 
Oils, above) nor the harms of processed carbohydrates (see 
Carbohydrate-Rich Foods, above), the most common replace-
ment when dietary fat is reduced.
In recent years, the lack of cardiometabolic benefit of 
low-fat diets has been convincingly demonstrated. In trials 
of short-term weight loss, high-fat diets are at least as effec-
tive as low-fat diets (see Dietary Quality, Energy Balance).21 
For long-term weight maintenance, the fat content of foods 
is a poor metric for differentiating protective versus harmful 
effects.28,29,51 Both prospective cohorts and large randomized 
trials confirm that low-fat diets have no benefits for major

chronic diseases (Figure 7).157,331 The large WHI random-
ized trial substantially lowered total dietary fat among nearly 
50 000 US women followed for nearly a decade, and did not 
show benefits for any major end point including heart disease 
(Figure 2, top), stroke, cancers, diabetes mellitus, or insulin 
resistance.36–39 In contrast, randomized trials have confirmed 
the many prior observational cohort findings that diets higher 
in healthful fats, including in excess of the current 35% limit, 
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (Figure 2, bot-
tom) and diabetes mellitus.24,25,34,35 These latter trials confirm 
decades-old ecological evidence that some of the healthiest 
traditional diets in the world are rich in fats from vegetable 
oils, nuts, and seafood.19 Based on this evidence, the 2015 
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee stated, for the first 
time, that dietary guidelines should not focus on lowering 
total fat.21
The current restriction on total fat shapes numerous gov-
ernment feeding programs and policies;336 drives industry 
marketing of fat-reduced desserts, snacks, salad dressings, 
processed meats, and low-fat other products of poor nutri-
tional value; and leads most Americans to actively avoid 
dietary fat337 and instead consume far too many refined 
carbohydrates.21 Avoidance of total fat also undermines 
attempts to limit refined starch and added sugar, while dis-
couraging the food industry from providing products higher 
in healthful fats. Based on the accumulated evidence, a com-
prehensive restructuring of nutritional policy away from fat 
reduction is warranted.336
Saturated Fat 
Saturated fat represents a highly heterogeneous category 
of fatty acids, with chain lengths ranging from 6 to 24 car-
bons, deriving from diverse foods, and possessing dissimilar 
biology. For instance, palmitic acid (16:0) exhibits in vitro 
adverse effects; whereas medium-chain (6:0–12:0), odd-chain 
(15:0, 17:0), and very long-chain (20:0–24:0) saturated fats 
may have metabolic benefits.61,338,339 This biological and meta-
bolic diversity does not support the grouping together of all 
saturated fatty acids based on only one chemistry characteris-
tic: the absence of double bonds.340
Even for any single saturated fatty acid, the physiologi-
cal effects are complex. For instance, in comparison with 
carbohydrate, 16:0 raises blood LDL-cholesterol, yet simul-
taneously raises HDL-cholesterol, reduces triglyceride-rich 
lipoproteins and remnants, and has no appreciable effect on 
ApoB,341 the most salient LDL-related characteristic. Effects 
of 16:0 on ApoCIII, an apolipoprotein modifier of LDL- and 
HDL-related risk, are unknown; the triglyceride-lowering 
effects of 16:0341 would suggest potential benefit on lowering 
ApoCIII. Saturated fats also lower lipoprotein(a), an indepen-
dent and casual cardiovascular risk factor,342 in comparison 
with monounsaturated fat or carbohydrate.343
Dietary saturated fats are also obtained from very different 
foods – eg, cheese, grain-based desserts, dairy desserts, chicken, 
processed meats, unprocessed red meat, milk, yogurt, butter, 
vegetable oils, and nuts. Each of these possesses, in addition to 
saturated fat, numerous other ingredients and characteristics that 
modify their health effects. Judging the long-term health impact 
of foods or diets based on isolated macronutrient composition 
is unsound, often creating paradoxical food choices and prod-
uct formulations.336,340 Furthermore, tissue levels of even-chain 
saturated fatty acids (eg, 14:0, 16:0), that appear most harmful 
in vitro, commonly result from endogenous hepatic synthesis of 
fat in response to dietary intake of carbohydrate46; 14:0 and 16:0 
blood levels correlate more with intakes of dietary starches and 
added sugars than meats or dairy.61
These complexities clarify why total saturated fat con-
sumption has little relation to health. Judging a food or a per-
son’s diet as harmful because it contains more saturated fat, 
or as beneficial because it contains less, is unsound. This is 
consistent with the many longitudinal cohort studies demon-
strating largely neutral effects of overall saturated fat intake 
(Figure 7).39,157,344 Consistent with this, meats higher in pro-
cessing and sodium, rather than saturated fat, are most strongly 
linked to CHD (see Meats, above). Cheese, a leading source of 
saturated fat, is also linked to neutral or even beneficial effects 
on CHD and diabetes mellitus (see Milk, Cheese, Yogurt, 
above). In sum, these lines of evidence – complex lipid effects 
including little influence on ApoB, no relation of overall intake 
with CHD, and no observed cardiovascular harm for most 
major food sources – provide powerful and consistent evidence 
for absence of appreciable harms of total saturated fat.
Yet, while certain saturated fat–containing foods such as 
dairy, nuts, and vegetable oils promote health,20 these findings 
do not support the benefits of other saturated fat-rich foods. 
Although unprocessed red meats and butter may be relatively 
neutral for CHD, no studies demonstrate appreciable benefits, 
all meats appear to increase diabetes mellitus, and processed 
meats are strongly linked to CHD (see Meats, above).20,29,173,178 
This is the mistake of recent media reports: conflating com-
plexities of health effects and benefits of some saturated fat–
containing foods (and possibly some specific saturated fatty 
acids) with unsupported recommendations to eat more butter 
and bacon as routes to health.345
Yet, even among scientists, the cardiovascular health 
effects of saturated fat remain a controversial topic. Continued 
prioritization of saturated fat reduction appears to rely on 
selected evidence: eg, effects on LDL-cholesterol alone (dis-
counting the other, complex lipid and lipoprotein effects); 
historical ecological trends in certain countries (eg, Finland) 
but not in others; and expedient comparisons with polyun-
saturated fat, the most healthful macronutrient. For example, 
although falling blood cholesterol concentrations in some 
Western countries correlate with decreases in national satu-
rated fat intake, trends in intakes of dietary fats cannot explain 
most of the blood cholesterol changes across or within most 
nations. For instance, total blood cholesterol fell similarly in 
the United States and France between 1980 and 2000, but 
national changes in dietary fats may explain only ≈20% of the 
decline in the United States, and virtually none of the decline 
in France.346
In certain Western nations, statin use may account for a 
large proportion of declining blood cholesterol after 2000347,348; 
however, because of the relatively low use for primary preven-
tion before this period, statins cannot explain the observed 
similar declines in blood cholesterol over the preceding 20 to 
30 years. Reasons for the large and steady declines in blood 
cholesterol and blood pressure over the past 4 decades in

nearly all Western nations are not fully elucidated, particu-
larly when viewed against the backdrop of increasing obesity. 
The extent to which these pervasive declines reflect trends in 
medication use, dietary fats, other dietary changes, physical 
activity, or other unknown influences (eg, related to fetal nutri-
tion, the microbiome, or other unknown pathways) remains 
unclear.
Based on the similar cardiovascular effects of consuming 
total carbohydrate versus saturated fat, and the comparative 
benefit of polyunsaturated fats, guidelines to lower saturated 
fat are increasingly highlighting the importance of consum-
ing polyunsaturated fats as the specific replacement.21 Yet, 
the resulting benefit appears specific to increased intake of 
polyunsaturated fat, rather than reduced saturated fat. For 
instance, total saturated fat, carbohydrate, and protein each 
appear relatively neutral for CHD, whereas the effects of 
total monounsaturated fat remain uncertain (see below).21,349 
The relatively neutral effects of each of these macronutri-
ents likely reflect substantial heterogeneity in nutrient sub-
types and food sources within each of these categories. In 
comparison with any of these broad categories, polyunsatu-
rated fat appears to be similarly beneficial.350 Consequently, 
it makes little sense to focus on saturated fat, which repre-
sents a smaller proportion of calories than these other mac-
ronutrients, especially carbohydrate. Indeed, in comparison 
with refined carbohydrates, saturated fat appears slightly 
beneficial.155,351 These lines of evidence support guidelines to 
increase healthful vegetable oils rich in polyunsaturated fats 
and phenolics, optimally in place of refined grains, starches, 
and added sugars.
Monounsaturated Fat 
Although monounsaturated fat (predominantly oleic acid, 
18:1) has conventionally been considered a cardiopro-
tective fat, the evidence supporting this notion is mixed 
(Figure 7).21,39,157,352 Monounsaturated fat improves BP and 
cholesterol353 and, when consumed in place of saturated fat, 
lowers glucose among those predisposed to insulin resis-
tance.354 Yet, total monounsaturated fat intake is not associated 
with lower incidence of diabetes mellitus355; it is associated 
with trends toward greater CVD in some cohort studies155; 
and it increases atherosclerosis in primate experiments, poten-
tially because of the enrichment of LDL cholesteryl oleate and 
increased LDL proteoglycan binding.356 Taken together, the 
current evidence for cardiometabolic benefits of total mono-
unsaturated fat (largely oleic acid) is not strong.21
The food source may modify these health effects. For 
instance, cohort studies suggest that the consumption of 
olive oil, but not mixed animal and plant sources of mono-
unsaturated fat, is linked to lower risk,352 whereas vegetable 
oil sources of monounsaturated fat increase LDL cholesteryl 
oleate but reduce LDL proteoglycan binding.357 These results 
suggest that other compounds in these fats/oils may modify 
the overall health effects (see Phenolic Compounds, below). 
Thus, focusing on specific types of foods and oils, rather than 
monounsaturated fat content per se, may be most prudent. 
Extra virgin olive oil and mixed nuts, and perhaps high-oleic 
canola oil, appear to be good dietary choices to improve car-
diometabolic health.24,25,34,35,145,255
Polyunsaturated Fat 
Polyunsaturated fats include n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, with this 
distinction based on the carbon location of the first double bond. 
The most common are n-6 linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) and n-3 
α-linoleic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), derived principally from veg-
etables and their oils (eg, soybean, canola, flaxseed, walnuts). 
Seafood is the major source of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated 
fats, principally EPA and DHA.201 Although the liver readily 
synthesizes saturated and monounsaturated fats from carbohy-
drate (by means of hepatic de novo lipogenesis), humans cannot 
synthesize or interconvert LA or ALA, making them essential 
fatty acids that must be consumed in the diet. Humans also syn-
thesize relatively little EPA and DHA,344 for which diet remains 
the major source. Evidence for cardiometabolic effects of sea-
food-derived n-3 fats are reviewed above (see Fish).
LA consumption lowers LDL-cholesterol and triglycer-
ide-rich lipoproteins and raises HDL-cholesterol.349 Although 
potential proinflammatory effects of LA have been theorized358 
and popularized, such inference is based largely on rodent 
experiments, with little supportive evidence in humans.359–362 
Indeed, in people, LA appears to have anti-inflammatory and 
insulin-sensitizing effects.363–365 In controlled trials, in com-
parison with saturated fat, LA reduces hepatic steatosis and 
systemic inflammation and increases lean muscle mass.366,367 
Arachidonic acid, the prototypical metabolite of LA, is also 
commonly considered proinflammatory, but is also the natu-
ral precursor to specialized proresolving mediators of inflam-
mation.368,369 In prospective studies, higher biomarker levels 
of arachidonic acid are linked to significantly lower risk of 
CHD.39 LA is also associated with significantly lower risk of 
CHD (Figure 7), whether in comparison with carbohydrate 
or saturated fat350; and, in meta-analysis of controlled clinical 
trials, consumption of n-6–rich vegetable oils, in place of ani-
mal fats, reduces CHD events (Figure 7).349 Notably, in these 
latter trials, the average intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fat was 
≈15% energy,349 higher than current dietary guidelines that 
recommend no more than  10% to 11% energy from polyun-
saturated fat.370
In comparison with seafood sources, ALA is a relatively 
available and inexpensive plant source of n-3 polyunsaturated 
fat. Ecological studies suggest health benefits of increasing ALA 
intakes in populations with low overall n-3 polyunsaturated fat 
intake.356 
Yet, the findings of trials of ALA and risk markers, such 
as platelet function, inflammation, endothelial function, and arte-
rial compliance, and observational studies of ALA’s association 
with CVD and diabetes mellitus endpoints, have been mixed 
and inconclusive.371,372 Few long-term trials of ALA and clinical 
events have been conducted; in 1 Dutch trial, 40 months of an 
ALA-containing margarine led to a small, nonsignificant reduc-
tion in major cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% con-
fidence interval, 0.78–1.05).373 Further investigation of ALA’s 
role in cardiometabolic health is warranted (Figure 7).211,372
LA has similar CHD benefits whether replacing carbohy-
drate or saturated fat (see Saturated Fat, above).349,350 Thus, 
increased consumption of polyunsaturated fat-rich vegetable 
oils is an evidence-based strategy to lower CHD risk, whether 
in place of saturated fat or carbohydrate. Optimally, polyun-
saturated fat-rich vegetable oils should perhaps replace refined 
starches and added sugars, given the independent harms of 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 Mozaffarian  Dietary and Policy Priorities  209
these refined carbohydrates. Because the controlled trials 
demonstrating CHD benefits of PUFA used soybean oil,349 
which contains both n-6 (LA) and n-3 (ALA) polyunsaturated 
fats, the selection of vegetable oils containing both n-6 and 
n-3 fatty acids (eg, soybean, canola) may be most prudent. 
Because both n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fats are beneficial, 
little interaction between them is evident, and the n-3:n-6 ratio 
is not a practical metric to evaluate health effects.364,374
Trans Fatty Acids 
Trans fatty acids (TFAs) are mono- or polyunsaturated fats with 
one or more double bonds in a trans position, rather than the 
mammalian synthesized cis position. Although small amounts 
of natural TFA are found in meats and milk of ruminants (eg, 
cow, sheep, goat; formed by gut microorganisms), these con-
tribute minimally to diet (<0.5%E) and do not associate with 
CVD risk375; indeed, trans-16:1n-7, a trace TFA biomarker 
of dairy fat, is linked to a lower risk of diabetes mellitus and 
sudden cardiac death.247 Conversely, high levels of industrially 
produced TFA can be consumed from partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils, which typically contain 30% to 60% TFA. These 
fats have industrial advantages for commercial deep frying, 
baked goods, packaged snacks, and shortening. Higher TFA 
intake from partially hydrogenated oils is consistently associ-
ated with the risk of CHD and sudden death (Figure 7).331,376 
In trials, TFAs have unique adverse effects on blood lipids and 
lipoproteins, including raising LDL-cholesterol, ApoB, tri-
glycerides, and lipoprotein(a), and lowering HDL-cholesterol 
and ApoA1; these effects are generally consistent whether the 
TFA replaces saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated 
fat.377 TFAs also appear to have nonlipid adverse effects, pro-
moting inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resis-
tance, visceral adiposity, and arrhythmia, although the strength 
of evidence for these different nonlipid effects varies.378,379 In 
sum, the implicated pathways suggest that TFA-containing 
partially hydrogenated oils influence pathways related to adi-
pocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance. Emerging evidence 
suggests that 18:2 TFA isomers may be the most adverse; these 
can be formed through not only partial hydrogenation, but also 
other industrial processes such as oil deodorization and high-
temperature cooking.380,381 Because partially hydrogenated oils 
are food additives with clear adverse effects, their elimination 
is a public health priority.247,382–384
Protein 
The cardiometabolic effects of dietary protein are not well 
established. In meta-analysis of randomized trials, increased 
protein consumption has little effect on cardiometabolic risk 
factors including adiposity, lipids, blood pressure, inflamma-
tion, or glucose.385 Few longitudinal studies have reported 
on total protein intake and CHD events, with generally null 
results.189,386 This is not surprising: similar to total fat or total 
carbohydrate, total protein represents the sum of very different 
foods (red meats, processed meats, milk, cheese, yogurt, fish, 
nuts, legumes, etc) with widely divergent health effects. Thus, 
a focus on dietary protein per se appears much less relevant 
for CVD than a focus on specific types of foods consumed. A 
few cohorts have seen protective associations of animal pro-
tein intake with the risk of hemorrhagic stroke; causality and 
mechanisms remain unclear, but have been hypothesized to 
relate to the potentially protective effects of animal protein or 
dietary cholesterol on vascular fragility.198,199
Behavior Change
Barriers and Opportunities for Healthy Eating 
Many current approaches to improving nutrition – eg, clinical 
counseling, food labels, menu labeling, dietary guidelines –  
arise from an implicit assumption that dietary habits are pri-
marily a function of individual choice. In reality, multiple 
complex factors influence dietary choices (Figure 9). Even at 
the individual level, dietary habits are determined not simply 
by personal preference but also by familial norms, education, 
income, nutritional and cooking knowledge and skills, and 
health status.387 Additional relevant factors include attitudes 
toward food and health, incentives, motivation, and values.388 
Other lifestyle behaviors such as television watching and sleep 
also influence patterns of food consumption.28,71,72,389 Outside 
the individual, sociocultural determinants include cultural 
norms, social pressures, and social networks.390 Additional 
environmental influences include neighborhood accessibil-
ity (eg, food availability, cost, convenience). Each of these 
individual, environmental, and sociocultural determinants is 
shaped by, and in turn shapes, much broader drivers of food 
choice such as agricultural policy and production practices, 
food industry formulations and marketing, national and inter-
national trade agreements, other market forces, climate, and 
agricultural policies.391 These complex determinants each 
represent a potential barrier, but also a promising lever and 
opportunity, for encouraging healthful diets.
Some have argued that humans are biologically wired to 
prefer specific unhealthful foods, eg, rich in fat, sugar, and 
salt. This perspective is overly simplistic and inconsistent 
with several lines of empirical evidence. For instance, most 
dietary fats are healthful, making a food’s fat content a poor 
marker of its intrinsic harm or benefit (see Total Fat). In addi-
tion, taste preferences are highly complex, influenced by con-
siderations of aroma, appearance, color, shape, and texture. 
The observed diversity of diets within and across individuals, 
generations, cultures, and populations further belies a particu-
lar biological preference for food.4,346,392–394 Even the brain’s 
unconscious reward/craving (addiction) centers are plastic 
and can be trained over months to respond to healthful rather 
than unhealthful foods.395 Furthermore, for the food industry, 
the success or failure of specific products has often depended 
not on differences in contents of fat, sugar, or salt, but on the 
prowess and power of their convenience, packaging, mar-
keting, and promotion.396 Undoubtedly, taste plays a role in 
consumer choice, but so do availability, price, packaging, 
marketing, convenience, and culturally driven perceptions of 
norms, status, and prestige. Each of these levers are powerful 
and can be used to influence the selection of healthier foods.
Clinical (Individual-Based) Strategies 
Numerous randomized controlled trials have identified effec-
tive approaches for successful individual behavior change 
(Table 5).94,95 These strategies have demonstrated efficacy 
and should be incorporated by providers into their practice 
to target specific dietary behaviors and other lifestyle hab-
its, such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and medication 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 210  Circulation  January 12, 2016
noncompliance. Providers should recognize that, although 
patient compliance with both lifestyle and medications is 
similarly imperfect, such strategies, even imperfectly imple-
mented, improve clinical outcomes.397
Health Systems Strategies 
For many clinicians, a variety of barriers within the health sys-
tem can limit their ability to fully implement effective behavior 
change strategies. Such barriers might include, for example, lim-
ited patient visit time to focus on behavior change, insufficient 
financial or other provider incentives for health promotion, sub-
optimal knowledge or experience on the most effective behavior 
change strategies and relevant behavioral targets, and inadequate 
tools for assessing and monitoring behaviors over time. Specific 
changes in the healthcare system can strongly support and facili-
tate behavior change efforts by providers (Table 6).10,95,398,399 Such 
healthcare systems approaches are being introduced for tobacco 
and obesity control efforts. Many electronic medical records sys-
tems have fields for tobacco use and body weight, although their 
accuracy and consistency of use remain variable. The expansion 
of these healthcare system approaches to target diet quality is 
crucial, especially in light of new incentives in the Affordable 
Care Act for creating new electronic health record systems and 
for focusing on prevention in Accountable Care Organizations.
Novel Technology Strategies 
Recent years have witnessed an explosion of novel personal 
technologies that aim to improve health, including mobile 
device applications (mHealth), Internet-based programs, and 
personal tracking devices (eg, FitBits). These technologies are 
promising because of the potential for low cost, scalability, 
use in multiple settings (including middle- and low-income 
nations), and opportunities for continuous, personalized mod-
ifications and improvements. Many incorporate established 
behavior-change strategies (Table 5) such as setting proximal, 
targeted goals; self-monitoring; feedback; and peer support.
A systematic review identified numerous randomized tri-
als and quasi-experimental studies evaluating these approaches 
for dietary change and/or weight loss (Afshin A, Mozaffarian 
D; unpublished data; 2015). Most were Internet based or com-
bined Internet and mobile approaches. The great majority had 
durations between 6 weeks and 6 months; very few extended 
beyond 1 year. Approximately two-thirds of these studies iden-
tified improved dietary behaviors or greater weight loss with the 
use of these novel technologies, in comparison with usual care. 
Although promising, little is known on their long-term effec-
tiveness and sustainability, and longer-term studies are required.
Policy Strategies 
Given the key roles of social and environmental factors in shap-
ing dietary habits, policy (population-based) approaches are 
crucial to achieve broad success. Effective strategies can be 
designed and implemented at local levels (eg, schools, work-
sites, communities), and at city, state, national, and interna-
tional levels. Several specific approaches have strong evidence 
for efficacy (Table 7).10,11 These experiences generally demon-
strate that education or information alone, without additional 
economic or environmental changes, has a limited influence 
on behavior.11,400,401 Integrated, multicomponent approaches

that include upstream policy measures, midstream educa-
tional efforts, and downstream community and environmental 
approaches may be especially effective. Policy strategies can 
complement health systems efforts while also reducing social 
and racial disparities caused by the clustering of suboptimal diet 
habits, local environments, and disease risk factors.
Several factors have limited the translation of this knowledge 
to action, including evolving messages and confusion about spe-
cific dietary priorities, uncertainty regarding effective methods 
for behavior change, and inadequate tools to monitor diets effi-
ciently. Fortunately, other public health successes for complex 
behavioral challenges- eg,  tobacco use, motor vehicle safety-
encourage optimism for the success of concerted multicompo-
nent strategies that include strong quality standards and policy 
actions to improve diet. At the population level, even modest 
shifts in risk factors can substantially and rapidly alter population 
health.97,402
Role of Multiple Stakeholders 
Successful, sustainable improvements in population dietary 
behaviors will require close collaboration among multiple 
stakeholders, including academics, clinicians, health systems, 
insurers, community organizations, schools, workplaces, 
advocacy groups, policy makers, farmers, retailers, restau-
rants, and food manufacturers.10,391,403 For instance, academic 
institutions should prioritize research on optimal dietary tar-
gets and cost-effective policies; engage with communities, 
advocacy groups, and policy makers; and inform and evalu-
ate industry efforts. Clinicians should implement behavior 
change strategies; advocate for broad health system changes 
to support these efforts; and engage with local communi-
ties. Communities, schools, and workplaces should demand 
and support comprehensive programs for dietary change. 
Advocacy groups should partner with scientists to dissemi-
nate best practices while holding government and industry 
accountable for meaningful action.
Local and national governments should prioritize nutrition 
and facilitate participation of other stakeholders in policy devel-
opment, implementation, and evaluation. Based on its impact on 
health, the environment, and the economy, nutrition is among 
the leading global issues of our time. Policy makers at all levels 
must recognize and focus on these topics. Surveillance, moni-
toring, and evaluation of dietary habits and diet-related policies 
are necessary to develop solutions, assess whether implemented 
programs have intended effects, identify and address disparities, 
and detect unintended consequences. Organized global public 
health efforts must complement these activities, assist smaller 
governments with effective food policies, and provide a coun-
tervailing force to multinational industry lobbying. Key global 
economic and political institutions that must play more assertive 
roles include the United Nations, the World Health Organization, 
the World Trade Organization, and the World Bank.
The food industry, from agricultural producers to food 
manufacturers, retailers, and restaurants, must also commit to 
healthier foods. Although big food has shared many tactics with 
big tobacco – eg, lobbying, deception, denial, resistance to regu-
lation404 – these 2 industries are not fully analogous. The food 
industry is far more heterogeneous, from types of products to 
strengths of commitment to healthfulness. The food industry has 
also demonstrated some responsiveness to dietary guidelines and 
public preferences over the past 40 years: eg, generating low-fat 
products, margarines, noncaloric sweeteners, low-carbohydrate 
products, gluten-free and organic foods, and many others. Our 
food systems have also made tremendous progress in reducing 
food-borne illness, increasing volume and production, improv-
ing convenience and stability, and reducing cost – all important 
Table 5. Evidence-Based Approaches for Individual Behavior 
Change in the Clinic Setting
•  
Specific, proximal, shared goals. Set specific, proximal goals in 
collaboration with the patient, including a personalized plan to achieve the 
goals (eg, increase fruits by 1 serving/d over the next 3 mo).
•  
Self-monitoring. Establish a strategy for self-monitoring, such as a dietary 
or physical activity diary or web-based or mobile phone application.
•  
Scheduled follow-up. Schedule regular follow-up (in-person, telephone, 
written, or electronic), with clear frequency and duration of contacts, to 
assess success, reinforce progress, and set new goals as necessary
•  
Regular feedback. Provide feedback on progress toward goals, including 
using in person, telephone, or electronic feedback.
•  
Self-efficacy.* Increase the patient’s perception that they can successfully 
change their behavior.
•  
Motivational interviewing.† Use motivational interviewing when patients 
are resistant or ambivalent about behavior change.
•  
Family and peer support. Arrange long-term support from family, friends, 
or peers for behavior change, such as in workplace, school, or community 
programs.
•  
Multicomponent approaches. Combine 2 or more of the above strategies 
into the behavior change effort.
*Examples of strategies to increase self-efficacy include mastery experiences 
(set a reasonable, proximal goal that the person can successfully achieve); 
vicarious experiences (have the person see someone with similar capabilities 
performing the behavior, such as walking on a treadmill or preparing a healthy 
meal); physiological feedback (explain to the patient when a change in their 
symptoms is related to worse or improved behaviors); and verbal persuasion 
(persuade the person that you believe in their capability to perform the behavior).
†Motivational interviewing represents the use of individual counseling to 
explore and resolve ambivalence toward changing behavior. Major principles 
include fostering the person’s own awareness and resolution of their 
ambivalence, and their own self-motivation to change, in a partnership with the 
counselor or provider.
Table 6. Evidence-Based Health Systems Approaches to 
Support and Facilitate Behavior Change
•  
Ongoing training for providers on evidence-based behavior change strategies 
as well as relevant dietary targets, including relevant ethnic and cultural issues.
•  
Integrated systems to facilitate coordinated care by multidisciplinary teams, 
including physicians, nurse practitioners, dieticians, physical activity 
specialists, and social workers.
•  
Practical electronic systems to help assess, track, and report on specific 
dietary behaviors, including during, before, and after provider visits.
•  
Electronic systems for scheduling and tracking regular follow-up visits for 
behavior change.
•  
Electronic systems to facilitate provision of feedback to patients and 
providers on progress during behavior change efforts.
•  
Reimbursement guidelines and incentives that reward behavior change efforts.
•  
Restructuring of practice goals and quality benchmarks to incorporate key 
dietary interventions and targets.

priorities of the last century. Healthfulness for chronic diseases, 
in particular, cardiometabolic diseases, has been the great fail-
ure – one that must now be addressed with modern nutrition 
and policy science. Perhaps most importantly, with tobacco, 
the ultimate aim is total elimination. In contrast, we need major 
agribusiness, food manufacturers, and retailers to successfully 
feed the 7+ billion people on the planet. These businesses must 
support and be informed by modern evidence, advance their 
technical expertise to formulate and sell healthier products, and 
use consumer education, marketing, and product pricing to pro-
mote dietary health. Agriculture and food industry should form 
transparent, sincere partnerships with advocacy groups, govern-
ments, and other stakeholders to replace less healthy foods with 
more healthful options. Their ultimate success must be linked to 
selling of healthful, optimally processed foods in a sustainable 
and profitable fashion.
Motor vehicle safety provides an informative analogy 
(Figure 10). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
named reduced fatalities from motor vehicle accidents as one of 
the top 5 public health successes of the 20th century.405 This 
remarkable success was not achieved merely by national driving 
guidelines, motor vehicle labeling, or other consumer-focused 
education – ie, many of the current emphases for dietary change 
– but by a comprehensive, multicomponent effort targeting the 
consumer (driver), product (car), environment (road), and cul-
ture (particularly drunk driving). This provides a road map for 
improving population diets: address the consumer, the product 
(foods and beverages), the environment (retailers, cafeterias, 
restaurants), and the culture (unhealthy eating, marketing). For 
instance, just as driving under the influence of alcohol is now 
socially stigmatized, the acceptability of fast foods, soda, and 
ultraprocessed products, including industry and celebrity mar-
keting of such foods, must be reduced. Just as the auto industry 
remains successful and profitable, and the public continues to 
use and benefit from cars, a similar multicomponent, evidence-
informed approach is needed to produce a successful, profitable 
food system that provides safe, healthful products.
Conclusions – The Way Forward
The global challenges of diet-related obesity, diabetes mellitus, 
and CVD present enormous health and economic burdens403 
and emphasize the imperative of prioritizing nutrition in clini-
cal care, advocacy, research, and policy. Scientific advances 
provide a wealth of new evidence to identify several key dietary 
priorities for cardiometabolic health. These include food-based 
priorities for more fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, 
fish, vegetable oils, yogurt, and whole grains; and fewer pro-
cessed (sodium-preserved) meats and foods higher in refined 
carbohydrates and salt (Figure 3). Red meats should be mini-
mized to prevent diabetes mellitus; butter used occasionally but 
not emphasized; and other foods (eg, unprocessed poultry, eggs) 
consumed in moderation according to personal preference. 
Table 7. Evidence-Based Policy Approaches to Improve Population Dietary Habits
Media and education •  
Sustained, focused media and education campaigns, using multiple modes, for increasing consumption of specific healthful foods or 
reducing consumption of specific less healthful foods or beverages, either alone or as part of multicomponent strategies.*
• On-site supermarket and grocery store educational programs to support the purchase of healthier foods.
Labeling and 
information
• Mandated nutrition facts panels or front-of-pack labels/icons as a means to influence industry product formulations.†
Economic incentives • Subsidy strategies to lower prices of more healthful foods and beverages.‡
• Tax strategies to increase prices of less healthful foods and beverages.‡
•  
Long-term changes in broad agricultural policies (not subsidies alone) to create infrastructure that facilitates production, transportation, 
storage, and marketing of healthier foods.
Schools
•  
Multicomponent interventions focused on improving both diet and physical activity, including specialized educational curricula, trained 
teachers, supportive school policies, a formal physical education program, serving of healthier food and beverage options, and a parental/
family component.
• School garden programs including nutrition and gardening education and hands-on gardening experiences.
• Fresh fruits and vegetables programs that provide free fruits and vegetables to students during the school day.
Workplaces
• Comprehensive worksite wellness programs including dietary, physical activity, and tobacco cessation/prevention components.
•  
Increased availability of healthier food/beverage options and strong nutrition standards for foods and beverages served, in combination with 
on-site prompts, labels, or icons to select healthier choices.
Neighborhood 
environment
• Increased availability of supermarkets near homes.§
Quality standards
•  
Quality standards for marketing of foods and beverages to children, including on television, near schools and public places frequented by 
youths, on packages, or in other fashions. (IIa B).†
• Quality standards on harmful (eg, sodium, partially hydrogenated oil) or beneficial (eg, healthful fats) ingredients in foods.
*Evidence for effectiveness of long-term campaigns (eg, > 3 y) comes mainly from multicomponent interventions, making it difficult to quantify the independent 
effects of the media efforts.
†Effects on industry formulations are based largely on anecdotal observations. There is not strong evidence that consumer behavior is appreciably influenced by the 
provision of dietary information through food product or menu nutrition labeling.11,400,401
‡The magnitude of the dietary change correlates with the size of the price difference. Certain population subgroups, including youth and lower socioeconomic 
populations, are especially sensitive to economic incentives.
§Based largely on cross-sectional associations, few longitudinal data are available. Cross-sectional findings consistently show a beneficial association between the 
availability of neighborhood supermarkets and diet quality or diet-related risk factors; similar analyses for availability of grocery stores, convenience stores, and fast-food 
restaurants have been far less consistent.

Coffee and tea can be enjoyed, with possible (but not yet con-
firmed) benefits; and alcohol, if consumed, should be moderate 
(up to 1 drink/d for women and 2 drinks/d for men). Harmful 
additives, in particular sodium, trans fat, and added sugar, will 
generally be lower in such diets and must be further minimized 
through strong policy actions. There is growing evidence and 
consensus for such food-based dietary patterns as the best 
means to reduce CVD, obesity and weight gain, and diabetes 
mellitus,21 replacing outdated emphases on total fat, other iso-
lated nutrients, and calorie counting. Clinical behavior-change 
efforts, health system changes, novel technologies, and robust 
policy strategies must complement and facilitate these individ-
ual food choices, which together will reduce cardiometabolic 
disease and economic burdens across the population.
