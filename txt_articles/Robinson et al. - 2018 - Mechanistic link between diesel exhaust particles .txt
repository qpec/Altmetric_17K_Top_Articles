 Background: Diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) are a major
component of particulate matter in Europe’s largest cities, and
epidemiologic evidence links exposure with respiratory
symptoms and asthma exacerbations. Respiratory reflexes are
responsible for symptoms and are regulated by vagal afferent
nerves, which innervate the airway. It is not known how DEP
exposure activates airway afferents to elicit symptoms, such as
cough and bronchospasm.
Objective: We sought to identify the mechanisms involved in
activation of airway sensory afferents by DEPs.
Methods: In this study we use in vitro and in vivo
electrophysiologic techniques, including a unique model that
assesses depolarization (a marker of sensory nerve activation) of
human vagus.
Results: We demonstrate a direct interaction between DEP and
airway C-fiber afferents. In anesthetized guinea pigs
intratracheal administration of DEPs activated airway C-fibers.
The organic extract (DEP-OE) and not the cleaned particles
evoked depolarization of guinea pig and human vagus, and this
was inhibited by a transient receptor potential ankyrin-1
antagonist and the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, major constituents of DEPs, were
implicated in this process through activation of the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor and subsequent mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species production, which is known to activate transient
receptor potential ankyrin-1 on nociceptive C-fibers.
Conclusions: This study provides the first mechanistic insights
into how exposure to urban air pollution leads to activation of
guinea pig and human sensory nerves, which are responsible for
respiratory symptoms. Mechanistic information will enable the
development of appropriate therapeutic interventions and
mitigation strategies for those susceptible subjects who are most
at risk. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2018;141:1074-84.)
Key words: Pollution, oxidative stress, transient receptor potential
ion channels, sensory nerves, vagus
Air pollution is a major global health concern, especially in
industrialized countries.1 In urban environments exposure to
traffic-derived particulate matter (PM) has been a major focus,
especially with regard to primary tailpipe emissions from diesel
vehicles. Because of size and low density, smaller PM fractions
are able to remain airborne, disperse widely in the environment,
and penetrate deep into the lungs when inhaled to distribute
throughout the respiratory tract. There is currently no safe lower
limit of exposure to PM. Diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) repre-
sent a significant proportion of urban PM,2,3 especially within Eu-
rope, because of the high proportion of diesel vehicles4 and
ongoing problems with emission compliance.5 Epidemiologic
studies have found strong associations between exposure to
DEPs or air pollution markers indicative of diesel exhaust (black
and elemental carbon) and respiratory symptoms, including
cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath6,7; hospital admissions8;
and mortality.9 Clinical studies using diesel exposure have docu-
mented increases in total symptom scores10,11 and increased
airway resistance.12 However, information regarding the molecu-
lar mechanism linking DEP exposure and respiratory symptoms is
lacking.
Respiratory reflexes are responsible for symptoms and regu-
lated by vagal afferent nerves, which innervate the airway.13-15
There are several different sensory nerve subtypes present in
the lung; some are more mechanically sensitive, and others are
more
chemosensitive,
namely
C-fibers
and
Ad-fibers,
respectively.
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels present on vagus
nerve termini situated in and under the airway epithelium can be
activated by a wide variety of stimuli to elicit reflexes, leading to
respiratory symptoms. These include mechanical and inflamma-
tory stimuli, environmental irritants, and changes in osmolarity,
pH, or temperature.16,17 On activation, TRP channels allow influx
of calcium into the cell, leading to subsequent membrane depolar-
ization and ultimately generation of an action potential that prop-
agates along the vagus nerve.18 Interestingly, one publication has
demonstrated DEP-induced activation of TRPV4 expressed in an
epithelial cell line, and another showed activation of TRPA1 on
murine dorsal root ganglion cells.19,20
Our hypothesis was that DEPs are able to initiate respiratory
symptoms through direct activation of lung-specific afferent
sensory nerves. The scope of this study was to determine whether
DEPs can directly activate airway sensory nerves by using a range
of human and animal in vitro models and in vivo electrophysio-
logic studies in an animal model. We also evaluated which
component of DEPs was responsible and the signaling mecha-
nisms involved.

 Human tissue and ethics
Human lungs and tracheas surplus to transplantation requirements (n 5 3,
56-73 years old; 1 male/2 female; 1 smoker/2 nonsmokers) with the vagus
nerve still attached were used to obtain translational data to complement data
generated in guinea pig tissue. Tissue was provided by the International
Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (IIAM, Edison, NJ). In all cases the
tissue was approved for use in scientific research, and ethical approval was
obtained from the Royal Brompton & Harefield Trust.
Compounds and materials
DEPs from a forklift truck (DEP SRM-2975) and its commercial organic
extract (DEP-OE SRM-1975) were purchased from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, Md). Generator DEPs,
obtained from the Air Pollution Exposure Laboratory, was obtained, and
these have been designed for controlled inhalation of human subjects to aged
and diluted diesel exhaust to mimic real-world occupational and environ-
mental conditions.22 Drugs (listed in the Methods section in this article’s On-
line Repository) were made up in stock solutions by using dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), with the final concentration of DMSO kept at 0.1% for experiments.
Particle suspensions
Particle suspension solutions were prepared freshly daily. Suspensions of
DEPs or cleaned particulate carbon core (par-DEPs) were prepared in
modified Krebs-Henseleit solution by means of sonication before dilution to
working concentrations. For in vivo experiments, suspensions were prepared
in PBS in a similar manner.
Physicochemical characterization of DEPs
Cryopreparation was done with an automatic plunge freezer. Nanoparticles
dispersed in 1 mg/mL in Krebs-Henseleit solution were dropped onto a grid
and frozen by rapidly plunging them into liquid ethane. These were transferred
in their frozen state into a cryo-rod and then into the electron microscope. For
chemical analysis, DEP samples were dispersed by means of sonication in
ethanol and then pipetted onto a grid at room temperature. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
analyses were performed. The organic/inorganic ratio composition of SRM
2975 was assessed by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) measurements were also carried out, as described in the
Methods section in this article’s Online Repository. DEPs were separated into
the organic extract (org-DEP) and cleaned particles (par-DEP) by using Soxh-
let extraction.
In vivo recording of action potential firing in single-
fiber afferents
Guinea pigs were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg) intraperitoneally.
The trachea was cannulated, and the animal was artificially ventilated. The
right jugular vein and carotid artery were cannulated for injecting drugs and
measuring systemic arterial blood pressure, respectively. Animals were
paralyzed with vecuronium bromide that was initially administered intrave-
nously at a dose of 0.10 mg/kg, followed every 20 minutes by 0.05 mg/kg
administered intravenously to maintain paralysis. The depth of anesthesia was
frequently assessed by monitoring the response of heart rate and blood
pressure to noxious stimuli (as described below). Both cervical vagus nerves
were located through a cervical incision, dissected free, and cut at the central
end. The left vagus nerve was used for sensory nerve fiber recording, as
previously described (diagram of experimental setup can be found in a recent
review article16).23 After identification of a suitable single nerve fiber, control
responses were obtained to capsaicin (100 mmol/L in saline, aerosolized for
15 seconds), acrolein (10 mmol/L in saline, aerosolized for 60 seconds),
and citric acid (300 mmol/L, aerosolized for 60 seconds). The nerve under
investigation was then challenged with either vehicle (PBS, 200 mL) or
DEPs (10 mg/mL in PBS, 200 mL, intratracheal dose), and subsequent action
potentials were recorded. For antagonist studies, control responses were
obtained to capsaicin (100 mmol/L in saline, aerosolized for 15 seconds), acro-
lein (10 mmol/L in saline, aerosolized for 60 seconds), and DEP-OE (1 mg/mL
in saline, aerosolized for 60 seconds) before intravenous introduction of Jans-
sen 130 (30 mg/kg, 1% methyl cellulose in saline) into the animal 60 minutes
before repeat challenge with capsaicin, acrolein, and DEP-OE. At the end of
the experiment, the conductionvelocity of the single nerve fiber was measured
to determine whether it was a slow-conducting nonmyelinated C-fiber or a
fast-conducting myelinated Ad-fiber. Using the same experimental setup
with thevagus nerves left intact and in the absence of neuromuscular blockade,
we assessed tracheal pressure (PT D increase [cm H2O]) as a marker of airflow
obstruction, which was expressed as the mean 6 SEM.
In vitro measurement of isolated vagus nerve
depolarization
Guinea pigs and mice were killed by means of injection of sodium
pentobarbitone (200 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally). Vagus nerves
were dissected, and depolarization was assessed as a measure of sensory nerve
activation, as described in previous publications.24-26 Human vagus was ob-
tained from IIAM, as previously described (http://www.iiam.org/).
Data analysis and statistics
Inhibition of DEP, phenanthrene, antimycin A, H2O2, capsaicin, and acro-
lein responses in the isolated vagus nerve preparation was analyzed by using a
2-tailed paired t test, comparing responses to agonist in the absence and pres-
ence of antagonist in the same piece of nerve. Data are presented as
means 6 SEMs, with statistical significance set at a P value of less than
.05. In single-fiber experiments data were analyzed by using the paired t
test, comparing responses (absolute values) after stimulus to baseline values
immediately preceding the response. Data are presented as means 6 SEMs,
with statistical significance set at a P value of less than .05. Inhibition of fiber
firing was analyzed by using a paired t test, comparing responses after antag-
onist with control values before antagonist or using an unpaired t test
comparing responses with vehicle control responses, as appropriate.
RESULTS
DEP-induced activation of airway sensory nerves
Intratracheal instillation of DEPs (10 mg/mL in PBS; dose
volume, 200 mL) in an anesthetized guinea pig model23,24 evoked
action potential firing in chemosensitive C-fibers (Fig 1, A and B)
but not mechanosensitive Ad-fibers (Fig 1, C, and Table I). The

3 mmol/L; see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jacionline.org). DEPs also depolarized isolated human vagal tis-
sue in a similar manner to guinea pig tissue (Fig 1, F and E,
respectively).
Characterization of DEPs
DEPs are made up of a carbonaceous core surrounded by an
organic hydrocarbon component; however, the precise size and
composition of each particle can vary greatly. Typically, DEPs
consist of primary nanoparticles (<100 nm) that can form larger
agglomerates several micrometers in size. The organic compo-
nents of DEPs include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) and their derivatives, as well as traces of numerous

 transitional metals, including iron, vanadium, manganese, cop-
per, zinc, and nickel.27 Cryo-electron microscopy images of the
DEPs used in these studies (DEP SRM-2975, commercially
available, generated by a forklift truck) indicated that individual
primary nanoparticles were roughly spherical, with diameters of
less than 100 nm; the majority were present as small irregular ag-
glomerates, although larger agglomerates up to several micro-
meters were present (Fig 2, A). Particle size was quantified by
measuring the longest length of the particles, and the majority
were found to be less than 1 mm in size (mostly <600 nm;
Fig 2, B, and see Fig E2, A, in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org), which was confirmed by using DLS
analysis (see Fig E2, B). Thus the DEPs were in a respirable
format that would be expected to deposit throughout the lower
respiratory tract on inhalation. TEM-EDX elemental analysis
confirmed low levels of metals (see Fig E3 in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jacionline.org). TGA indicated that DEPs
were composed of approximately 15% organic material and
83% inorganic carbon, with the remainder being trace impurities
(Fig 2, C).
Given that DEPs appeared to activate chemosensitive rather
than mechanosensitive sensory nerves, the organic chemical
components of DEPs (org-DEPs) were separated from the cleaned
particulate carbon core (par-DEPs) by using Soxhlet extraction.
In both guinea pig and human vagal tissue, org-DEPs depolarized
the vagus nerve in a similar manner to whole DEPs, whereas par-
DEPs did not induce a response (Fig 2, D).
Having established that the organic extract of DEPs was
responsible for its biological activity and to use a characterized
and standardized supply, we used the commercially available
extract of SRM-2975, namely SRM-1975, in the next experiments
(this is referred to in this article as DEP-OE). DEP-OEs
depolarized the guinea pig vagus nerve in a concentration-
dependent manner similar to DEPs (see Fig E4 in this article’s On-
line Repository at www.jacionline.org). These results indicate
that the organic material embedded on the surfaces of DEPs con-
tains the key components that activate sensory nerves. Polymyxin
B (300 mg/mL), a cyclic cationic polypeptide antibiotic, is widely
used to eliminate the effects of endotoxin contamination both
in vitro and in vivo but had no effect on depolarization induced

Role of TRP channels in DEP-OE–induced sensory
nerve activation
A submaximal concentration of DEP-OE (1 mg/mL) was
selected for antagonist studies (see Fig E4). The specific
TRPA1 antagonist Janssen 130 (10 mmol/L) significantly in-
hibited DEP-OE–induced depolarization in the isolated guinea
pig vagus nerve (Fig 3, A and B), whereas vehicle (0.1%
DMSO),
the

TRPV1
antagonist
Xention
D0501
(10 nmol/L), and the specific TRPV4 antagonist GSK2193874
(10 mmol/L) had no effect (Fig 3, B). Janssen 130, corresponding
to the 130 compound of the patent WO2010/141805,28 also
significantly inhibited DEP-OE–induced responses in the human
vagus nerve (Fig 3, C). These results were confirmed by using
genetically modified TRP knockout mice (Fig 3, D). Responses
in TRPV12/2 and TRPV42/2 mice were not significantly
different from those in wild-type (WT) mice. In vivo Janssen
130 (300 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally) significantly in-
hibited C-fiber firing to both the TRPA1-positive control (acro-
lein, 10 mmol/L) and aerosolized DEP-OE (1 mg/mL; Fig 3, F),
whereas vehicle had no effect (Fig 3, E). Janssen 130 (300 mg/
kg administered intraperitoneally) also significantly inhibited
the increased tracheal pressure evoked by aerosolized DEP-OE
(10 mg/mL; 2 responses to DEP-OE were evoked before
[20.7 6 3.02 and 19.63 6 1.73 PT D increase in cm H2O] and after
[5.23 6 0.79 PT D increase in cm H2O] Janssen 130; n 5 3;
P < .05).
Mechanisms of activation of TRPA1 by DEP-OE
The ability of DEPs to generate oxidative stress has been
implicated as a key mechanism driving its adverse health effects.29
Oxidative stress and the production of electrophiles have been
shown to activate TRPA1 through covalent modification of cysteine
residues.30-32 The oxidant H2O2 depolarized isolated guinea pig va-
gus nerve in a concentration-dependent manner (see Fig E5, A, in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Janssen
130 (10 mmol/L) but not vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or TRPV1 antago-
nism significantly inhibited H2O2-induced depolarization in the
guinea pig vagus nerve (see Fig E5, B). Vagus nerves from
TRPA12/2micehadsignificantlyreduceddepolarizationresponses
toH2O2comparedwithtissuesfromWTmice(seeFigE5,C).Inthe
presence of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; 1 mmol/L), re-
sponses to H2O2 (10 mmol/L), acrolein (300 mmol/L), and allyl iso-
thiocyanate (AITC; 300 mmol/L; TRPA1 agonists) were abolished
(Fig 4, A). DEP-OE–induced depolarization was also abolished by
application of NAC on guinea pig and human vagus (Fig 4, B).
When referencing thewide range of electrophilic chemicals present
within DEP-OE, phenanthrene (a PAH) was identified to be present
in relatively high concentrations (SRM-1975 Certificate Analysis
Sheet, NIST). PAHs are traditionally thought to exert their toxic

 effects through induction of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a
well-conserved transcription factor. Application of 2 specific AhR
antagonists, CH223191 (10 mmol/L) and 29, 49-trimethoxyflavone
(10 mmol/L), significantly inhibited depolarization responses to
both phenanthrene (1 nmol/L) and DEP-OE (Fig 4, C, and see
Fig E6 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).
Depolarization of the vagus nerve by DEP-OE was reduced in
AhR2/2 mice compared with WT mice (Fig 4, D). Furthermore,
antimycin A, a mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor
and generator of mitochondrial oxidant stress, depolarized the va-
gus nerve in a concentration-dependent manner (see Fig E7, A, in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), and this
response could be inhibited by the mitochondrial superoxide
scavenger (2-[2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-ylamino]-2-
oxoethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride (MitoTEMPO; 2 mmol/
L; see Fig E7, B). MitoTEMPO was capable of reducing the depo-
larization induced by DEP-OE (1 mg/mL) compared with that
with vehicle controls (Fig 4, E). These data suggest that electro-
philic compounds, such as the PAHs present in DEPs, activate
TRPA1 through an oxidative stress mechanism that involves
AhR and generation of mitochondrial oxidative stress.

 generated by a forklift truck). However, we also repeated key
observations with generator DEPs, which have been aged and
diluted to mimic real-world occupational and environmental
conditions. This generator diesel has been used in controlled
human exposure studies and is associated with a range of
respiratory symptoms.10,11,22 In these experiments depolariza-
tions of the guinea pig vagus evoked by generator DEPs (1 mg/
mL) were inhibited by the TRPA1 antagonist Janssen 130
(10 mmol/L; Fig 5, A and C) or the antioxidant NAC (1 mmol/
L; Fig 5, B and C), confirming results obtained with DEP SRM.
DISCUSSION
Epidemiologic studies have found strong associations between
exposure to DEPs and respiratory symptoms, including cough,
wheeze, and shortness of breath.6,7 In addition, links have been
made between combustion-derived PM and asthma symptoms
and exacerbations.33 DEP exposure has also been strongly associ-
ated with acute worsening of lung function34 and airway hyperre-
activity in asthmatic subjects.35 Although a large number of
previous studies have focused on the inflammatory effects of
DEPs on airway epithelium and immune cells,36,37 it is still not
known how DEPs can evoke respiratory reflexes and the associ-
ated symptoms or by what mechanisms.
Initial studies confirmed our hypothesis that intratracheal
instillation of DEPs could directly activate airway sensory
afferent nerves. However, contrary to our expectations that PM
would activate mechanosensitive rapidly adapting receptors
(RARs) or Ad-fibers, it was the chemosensitive C-fibers where
action potential discharge was noted in response to DEPs. The
isolated vagal preparation was used to confirm these observations
and to investigate this mechanism further because it is an in vitro
technique amenable to precise pharmacologic study without the
complications often associated with the interpretation of in vivo
experiments.16,24-26,38 Furthermore, and importantly, the use of
the human vagus nerve preparation allowed generation of transla-
tional data and provided an early indicator that data generated in
guinea pig vagus were predictive of effects in human subjects.
The potential for DEPs to directly activate airway sensory nerves
has important implications, given that millions of subjects living
in urban environments are exposed to DEPs on a daily basis and
that activation of airway sensory nerves can result in a wide range
of respiratory symptoms that can be particularly debilitating for
those with underlying respiratory conditions compared with
healthy subjects.

 Given its complex composition, DEPs (SRM-2975) underwent
physicochemical characterization so that the biological data
could be more easily interpreted. Cryo-electron microscopy
imaging indicated that the majority of DEPs were present in
small agglomerates, and TEM-EDX analysis indicated that a low
level of metal impurity was present, which is in agreement with
some previous studies.39 The TGA weight-loss profile revealed
that the DEPs were composed of approximately 15% organic ma-
terial, 83% inorganic carbon material, and 2% trace impurities, as
measured by weight. These findings are in general agreement with
existing published literature.40,41 Soxhlet extraction of DEPs re-
sulted in 2 separated components, the cleaned carbon particle
core (par-DEPs) and the organic extract (org-DEPs). Only the

 activity on the chemosensitive rather than mechanosensitive
airway afferents. Other experiments have also highlighted the
importance of the organic components of DEPs40,41 in its bio-
reactivity in vitro and in vivo, although we acknowledge that the
par-DEPs might be responsible for other biological effects of
diesel.
TRP channels are environmental sensors and initiate activation
of airway sensory nerves in response to exogenous and endog-
enous stimuli.17 Using pharmacologic intervention and tissues
from genetically modified mice, we demonstrated that DEP-
OE–induced activation of airway sensory nerves and increased
tracheal pressure (indicative of airflow obstruction) was through
TRPA1 activation. Although sensory afferents arising from the
dorsal root ganglia are not airway innervating and calcium influx
measurements do not assess action potential generation, our ob-
servations are consistent with data that demonstrated that DEPs
could activate rodent dorsal root ganglia neurons.20 This key
result was also demonstrated by using human vagus nerve.
TRPA1 is expressed exclusively on airway C-fibers, is activated
by a number of toxic environmental irritants, and has been shown
to cause cough in both human subjects and guinea pigs.25 TRPA1
is also thought to be a key channel involved in the late asthmatic
response in a rat model of allergic inflammation,42 and TRPA1
gene polymorphisms have been associated with childhood
asthma.43 TRPA1 can be activated by electrophiles through cova-
lent modification of cysteine residues on the cytoplasmic N-ter-
minus of the channel,44,45 and this explains its sensitivity to
reactive species that have an innate oxidative potential or the abil-
ity to generate intracellular oxidative stress.44,46 In the present
study we confirm that H2O2 was also able to depolarize the vagus
nerve in a TRPA1-dependent manner30,47 and that responses to
H2O2 and DEP-OE were inhibited by the general antioxidant
NAC. This is in general agreement with previous studies in which
the effects of DEPs have been inhibited by application of
NAC.11,48 DEPs, like other PM, are known to have a redox poten-
tial,49 and these results suggest that certain organic compounds
with oxidative potential within DEP-OE activate TRPA1.
Identification of the specific compounds responsible for
neuronal activation is important because it might allow for
strategies to be developed to produce safer diesel emissions.
Although the list of compounds present in DEP-OE in extensive
certain classes of compounds appear to be likely candidates for
the observed activation of TRPA1, PAHs are present on the
surfaces of DEPs and are known to possess toxic and carcinogenic
properties. Phenanthrene, one of the most commonly studied
PAHs, is found in higher concentrations in DEP-OE compared
with other chemicals. Phenanthrene depolarized the vagus nerve
in a similar manner to DEP-OE, and this depolarization was
blocked by a TRPA1 antagonist, suggesting this was one of the
chemicals responsible for activation of TRPA1. However, given
the number of chemicals within DEPs that share similar attributes,
such as other PAHs or nitro-PAHs, it is unlikely to be the only
activator of this pathway.
The toxic effects of PAHs are traditionally thought to be
mediated by the cytosolic AhR, a highly conserved and expressed
transcriptional regulator.50,51 On ligand binding, AhR is trans-
ported to the nucleus whereby it heterodimerizes to the aryl hy-
drocarbon nuclear translocator and forms a complex so that the
transcription of regulatory sequences that contain xenobiotic
response
elements
can
occur.52
Target
genes
include
detoxification response enzymes, such as the widely studied
CYP1A1 enzyme.53 After transcription has occurred, AhR is
transported back to the nucleus and degraded. Previous studies
in other experimental systems have shown that PAHs present
within DEPs can activate AhR signaling cascades,54-56 and
DEPs containing greater PAH content induce greater cytotoxic re-
sponses in a human bronchial epithelial cell line.57 However, typi-
cally, these transcriptional events occur over time courses that
span several hours, which is at odds with the present study, in
which we have shown that AhR inhibition (either in vagal tissue
from AhR knockout mice or using small molecule inhibitors)
immediately
and
significantly
reduced
depolarization
that
occurred in response to DEP-OE and phenanthrene. Because
AhR inhibition had no effect on the TRPA1 agonist acrolein, it
is likely that AhR plays a role upstream of TRPA1. Interestingly,
AhR has been identified in the mitochondria, where it has been
associated with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production, and these effects are thought to be independent of
either CYP1A1 or CYP1A2.58 Vagal sensory fibers are densely
packed with mitochondria.48 Antimycin A, which evokes ROS
from mitochondrial complex III, has been demonstrated to evoke
action potential discharge from nociceptive C-fiber terminals
innervating the mouse airways in a TRPA1-dependent manner.59
In this study we confirmed that antimycin A evoked vagal sensory
nerve activation and that this and the effect of DEP-OE were in-
hibited by the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger MitoTEMPO.
For the first time, these unique findings describe a nontranscrip-
tional signaling pathway for AhR and a role for mitochondrial
ROS in activation of airway sensory nerves and initiation of res-
piratory reflex events evoked by urban air pollution.
To assess the physiologic relevance of the DEP SRM used
experimentally with regard to real-life situations, we also
repeated key observations with generator DEPs that have been
aged and diluted to mimic real-world occupational and environ-
mental conditions. In these experiments depolarization of the
guinea pig vagus evoked by generator DEPs was inhibited by the
TRPA1 antagonist or the antioxidant NAC, confirming results
obtained with DEP SRM. This generator diesel has been used in
controlled human exposure studies and is associated with a range
of respiratory symptoms.10,11
In conclusion, in this study we demonstrate a direct interaction
between DEPs and airway C-fiber afferents mediated through an
oxidative stress pathway and activation of the TRPA1 ion channel
expressed on airway afferents. PAHs, major constituents of DEPs,
are implicated in this process through activation of AhR and
subsequent mitochondrial ROS production, which is known to
activate TRPA1 on nociceptive C-fibers. These findings provide
the first mechanistic insights into how exposure to a significant
component of urban particulate air pollution might precipitate
respiratory symptoms, such as cough and bronchospasm.
A comparison between PAH content of diesel fuels and wider
pollutants and TRPA1-mediated activation of airway sensory
nerves will lead to further insights into the mechanisms driving
the harmful effects of air pollution on the respiratory tract and
mitigation strategies for those who are affected and at risk.

 METHODS
Male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (Harlan, Bicester, United Kingdom)
were used, weighing 300 to 500 g for in vitro experiments and 400 to 750 g for
in vivo single-fiber experiments. Male C57BL/6 mice (Harlan) weighing 18 to
20 g were used as a background to produce WT mice. TRPV12/2 breeding
pairs were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background and were obtained orig-
inally from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me). TRPA12/2 mice were
originally developed by Professor David Julius (UCSF) and supplied as back-
crossed 10 generations onto the C57BL/6 background by Professor Peter Zyg-
munt from Lund University. Homozygous breeding pairs of mice genetically
modified to disrupt the TRPV4 gene were obtained from Riken BioResource
Center (Tsukuba, Japan).E1,E2 Vagal tissue was obtained from AhR2/2 mice
provided as a generous gift by Dr Rebecca Dearman from the University of
Manchester and Dr Mark Hayes (Imperial College, London). Genetic knock-
outs were confirmed by means of genotyping. All animals were housed in a
climate-controlled room (218C) with food and water freely available for at
least 1 week before commencing experiments. All experiments were per-
formed in accordance with the UK Home Office guidelines for animal welfare
based on the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 and the Animal
Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines.E3
Human tissue and ethics
Human lungs and tracheas surplus to transplantation requirements (n 5 3,
56-73 years old, 1 male/2 female, 1 smoker/2 nonsmokers) with the vagus
nerve still attached were used to obtain translational data to compliment data
generated in guinea pig tissue. Briefly, vagal tissue was dissected from around
the trachea and airways and dissected under a microscope to produce sections
suitable for in vitro experiments (see below). Tissue was provided by the
IIAM. In all cases the tissue was approved for use in scientific research, and
ethical approval was obtained from the Royal Brompton & Harefield Trust.

extract (DEP-OE, SRM-1975) were purchased from NIST. Capsaicin (TRPV1
agonist), acrolein (TRPA1 agonist), allyl isothiocyanate (AITC; TRPA1
agonist), citric acid, methylcellulose, PBS, hydrogen peroxide (30% vol/vol,
H2O2), NAC, CH223191, antimycin A, MitoTEMPO, polymyxin B sulfate
salt, dichloromethane (DCM), and DMSO were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (Dorset, United Kingdom). 29, 49-Trimethoxyflavone was purchased
from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, United Kingdom). Janssen 130 (TRPA1
antagonist), corresponding to compound 130 of the patent WO2010/141805
A1, and GSK2193874 (GSK219, TRPV4 antagonist) were synthesized by
the Medicinal Chemistry Department in Almirall (Almirall S.A., Barcelona,
Spain). Phenanthrene was a generous gift from Dr Ian Mudway (Kings Col-
lege London, London, United Kingdom). Xention D0501 (TRV1 antagonist)
was provided by Ario Pharma (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Drugs were
made up in stock solutions by using DMSO, with the final concentration of
DMSO kept at 0.1% for experiments.
Particle suspensions
Particle suspension solutions were freshly prepared daily. Suspensions of
DEPs or par-DEPs were prepared in modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (NaCl,
118 mmol/L; KCl, 5.9 mmol/L; MgSO4, 1.2 mmol/L; NaH2PO4, 1.2 mmol/L;
CaCl2, 2.5 mmol/L; glucose, 6.6 mmol/L; and NaHCO3, 25.5 mmol/L) by
means of sonication in a water bath for 10 minutes before dilution to working
concentrations. For in vivo experiments, suspensions were prepared in PBS in
a similar manner.
Physiochemical characterization of DEPs
Electron microscopy. The cryopreparation was done with a Leica
GP automatic plunge freezer (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, United
Kingdom). Nanoparticles dispersed in 1 mg/mL in Krebs-Henseleit solution
were dropped onto a grid and frozen by rapidly plunging into liquid ethane.
These were transferred in their frozen state into a cryo-rod (Gatan 914, Gatan
Inc, Pleasanton, Calif) and then into the electron microscope. Electron
microscopy
was
carried
out
on
a
Jeol
2100F
(JEOL
USA
Inc,
Peabody, Mass) equipped with a Schottky Field Emission Gun and operated
at 200 kV.
For chemical analysis, DEP samples were dispersed by means of sonication
in ethanol and then pipetted onto a grid at room temperature. TEM-EDX
analysis was performed on an FEI Titan 80-300 (S)TEM operated at 300 kV
fitted with a Cs (image) corrector and SiLi EDX spectrometer (EDAX,
Leicester, United Kingdom). EDX was carried out by condensing the electron
beam onto the region of interest and acquiring spectra for 180 seconds.
TGA. The organic/inorganic ratio composition of SRM 2975 was
assessed by using TGA with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 machine (PerkinElmer,
Beaconsfield, United Kingdom), heating 1.8 6 0.2 mg of DEPs to 1008C under
airflow (flow rate, 10 mL/min) and holding them isothermally for 30 minutes
to remove residual water, solvent, or both. The temperature was then increased
from 1108C to 8508C at a constant ramping rate of 108C/min under air flow
(10 mL/min).
DLS. DLS measurements were carried out by using a ZetaSizer Nano ZS
(Malvern, United Kingdom). DEP samples were prepared in Krebs-Henseleit
solution at 0.1 and 1 mg/mL and sonicated briefly in a sonicating water bath
immediately before being placed into disposable microcuvettes. Samples were
warmed to 378C and left to equilibrate for 60 seconds before DLS
measurements, which were carried out at a 1738 backscatter angle and in
triplicate for each sample. Measurement run durations were automatically
calculated on a per-sample basis.
Component separation DEPs
One gram of DEPs was loaded into an extraction thimble and extracted
overnight with DCM by using Soxhlet extraction equipment at 408C. The
extracted solvent was then evaporated by using a rotary evaporator and
reconstituted in DMSO up to a volume of 10 mL. This resulted in an
‘‘equivalent concentration’’ of organic extract of 0.1 g/mL, which represented
the organic material present in 1 g of DEPs now being present in 10 mL of
DMSO. The resulting org-DEP extract was centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 mi-
nutes to remove remaining particulates, and supernatant was carefully
removed. DEP-OE was then diluted in DMSO and stored at 2808C until
needed. The remaining particles left behind in the paper filter were heated
gently overnight to completely evaporate any remaining DCM and were
then kept as cleaned particles (par-DEP).
In vivo recording of action potential firing in single-
fiber afferents
Guinea pigs were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg) intraperitoneally. If
required, anesthesia was supplemented with additional urethane. The trachea
was cannulated with a short length of Portex tubing, and blood gases and pH
were maintained at physiologic levels by using artificial ventilation (Ugo
Basile small animal ventilator), with a tidal volume of 10 mL kg21 and 50 to 60
breaths min21 of laboratory air. The right jugular vein and carotid artery
(passed to the ascending aorta/aortic arch) were cannulated for injecting drugs
and measuring systemic arterial blood pressure, respectively. Systemic arterial
blood pressure and heart rate were continuously recorded with a transducer
(Gould P23XL, Gould Electronics, Eichstetten, Germany). Tracheal pressure
was measured with an air pressure transducer (SenSym 647, Honeywell Inc,
Minneapolis, Minn) connected to a side arm of the tracheal cannula. Body tem-
perature was continuously monitored with a rectal thermometer and main-
tained at 378C with a heated blanket and control unit (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, Mass). Animals were paralyzed with vecuronium bromide initially
administered at a dose of 0.10 mg/kg intravenously, followed every 20 minutes
by 0.05 mg/kg administered intravenously to maintain paralysis. The depth of
anesthesiawasfrequently assessedby monitoring theresponseofheart rateand
blood pressure to noxious stimuli. Both cervical vagus nerves were located
through a cervical incision and dissected free from the carotid artery and sym-
pathetic and aortic nerves; both vagus nerves were cut at the central end. The
left vagus nerve was used for sensory nerve fiber recording and was cleared of
its surrounding fascia. The skin and muscle in the neck at either side of the inci-
sion were lifted and tied to a metal ring to form a well, which was filled with
light mineral oil. Bipolar Teflon-coated platinum electrodes (exposed at the

 tips) wereused for recording purposesby usingfasciapositionedon 1electrode
for a reference. The vagus nerve was placed on a small black Perspex plate to
facilitate subsequent dissection. Thin nerve filaments were teased from the va-
gus nerve under a binocular microscope and placed on the second electrode un-
til a single active unit or one of not more than 2 or 3 units was obtained. Action
potentials were recorded in a conventional manner by using electrodes con-
nected to a pre-amp headstage (Digitimer NL100K; Digitimer, Fort Lauder-
dale, Fla). The signal was amplified (31000-35000, Digitimer NL104),
filtered (in the range of LF30Hz to HF8.5kHz, Digitimer NL125), and passed
through a Humbug noise reducer (AutoMate Scientific, Albany, Calif) before
input sampling and recording. All signals were sampled (50 kHz) and recorded
by using the Spike 2 software data acquisition system through a CED Mi-
cro1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic Design Limited, Cambridge, United
Kingdom). The software allowed pulse train counting over selected time pe-
riods. In addition, monitoring of the input signal to the Spike software was
also carried out on a digital storage oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 2012). The
input signal was also fed through an audio amplifier to a loudspeaker.
Aerosols were generated by using an Aerogen nebulizer (Buxco Nebulizer
Control-5; Data Sciences International [DSI], St Paul, Minn) connected to the
ventilator and arranged so that inspired air passed through the medication
chamber before entering the lungs of anesthetized animals through the
tracheal cannula.
Single vagus nerve fibers were identified as originating from the major
groups of airway sensory nerve endings, slowly adapting stretch receptors,
RARs, irritant receptors, and Ad fibers, which were further subdivided into
those that were more acid and/or less capsaicin sensitive and with CVs lower
than conventional RARs and pulmonary/bronchial C-fiber receptors by using
several criteria.E4 These include a pattern of spontaneous discharge, response
to hyperinflation and deflation, adaptation indices, response to capsaicin/citric
acid administration, and conductionvelocities. As a rule, a receptor that had no
obvious pattern to the spontaneous activity (often very sparse) and did not
respond to hyperinflation/hyperdeflation but did respond to capsaicin aerosol
was pursued as a C-fiber. Alternatively, a receptor that had a spontaneous
discharge with a definite rhythmic respiration pattern and adapted rapidly/var-
iably to hyperinflation/deflation was pursued as an Ad-fiber.
After identification of a suitable single-nerve fiber, control responses were
obtained to capsaicin (100 mmol/L in saline, aerosolized for 15 seconds),
acrolein (10 mmol/L in saline, aerosolized for 60 seconds), and citric acid
(300 mmol/L, aerosolized for 60 seconds). The nerves under investigation
were then challenged with either vehicle (PBS, 200 mL) or DEPs (10 mg/mL in
PBS, 200 mL, intratracheal dose), and subsequent action potentials were
recorded. For antagonist studies, control responses were obtained to capsaicin
(100 mmol/L in saline, aerosolized for 15 seconds), acrolein (10 mmol/L in
saline, aerosolized for 60 seconds), and DEP-OE (1 mg/mL in saline,
aerosolized for 60 seconds) before introduction of Janssen 130 (30 mg/kg,
1% methyl cellulose in saline) into the animal through the intravenous route
60 minutes before challenging again with capsaicin, acrolein, and DEP-OE.
At the end of the experiment, the conduction velocity of the single nerve
fiber was measured to determine whether it was a slow-conducting
nonmyelinated C-fiber or a fast-conducting myelinated Ad-fiber. This was
achieved by stimulating the vagus nerve close to the thorax with a
suprathreshold voltage (Grass stimulator, 0.5 ms, 1 Hz). The corresponding
action potential was recorded in the single nerve fiber under observation,
and the time between the initial stimuli and the resulting action potential
was calculated by using the Spike 2 software and used with the measured
distance between the 2 electrodes to calculate the conduction velocity. All
animals were killed at the end of experiments with an overdose of
pentobarbitone.
In vitro measurement of isolated vagus nerve
depolarization
Guinea pigs and mice were killed by means of injection of sodium
pentobarbitone (200 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally) and human vagus
obtained from IIAM. The vagus nerves were dissected, and experiments were
conducted in a fully characterized isolated vagus nerve preparation, as
described in previous publications.E5,E6 The 2 vagus nerve trunks were then
placed in Krebs-Henseleit solution bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 to stay
oxygenated. The vagal tissue was then cleaned of connective tissue before be-
ing cut into 15- to 20-mm segments. These segments were then mounted into a
grease-gap dual recording chamber system whereby the nerve was threaded
through a narrow cylindrical gap between a test chamber and a reference
chamber. The ends of the nerve exposed in each chamber were then electri-
cally and chemically isolated by means of application of petroleum jelly
into the cylindrical gap through a side arm. The end of the nerve exposed in
the test chamber was then constantly perfused at a rate of 2 mL/min with
oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution heated to 378C by using a custom-
designed water jacket housing. Borosilicate glass electrodes mounted onto
an Ag/AgCl pellet (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, Fla) were filled
with Krebs-Henseleit solution and placed into contact with the nerve in both
the test and reference chambers. Changes in surface charges between the
test and reference chambers were then recorded by using an extracellular po-
tential differential amplifier (DAM 50 Bioamplifier, World Precision Instru-
ments). Nerve depolarizations were filtered at 0.3 kHz, amplified 350, and
recorded onto a chart recorder (Lectromed Multi-Trace 2). During experi-
ments, the perfusate through the test chamber of the vagus was maintained
at 378C at a rate of 2 mL/min and a change of drug containing solution was
made through a manifold. Subsequent vagal depolarization were recorded in
response to various stimuli applied for 2 minutes. For general antagonist
studies, 2 repeatable baseline responses to agonists were first obtained before
pretreatment with an antagonist for 10 minutes before the 2-minute applica-
tion of the agonist in the presence of the antagonist. After a 10-minute
washout, a recovery response to an agonist was then obtained to confirm nerve
viability at the end of the experiment. If a recovery response could not be ob-
tained, data were disregarded. For MitoTEMPO antagonist studies using anti-
mycin A, an irreversible binding electron transport chain inhibitor, and other
agonists, nerve viability was confirmed at the beginning of the experiment by
using acrolein (300 mmol/L) before a single application of agonists with or
without antagonist present. Responses were compared across different tissues
from the same animal.
