Received 25 November 2015; accepted after revision 20 January 2016;
Aims
Ibutilide is a rapid-acting antiarrhythmic drug with worldwide use for conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation.
Vernakalant, approved in the EU in 2010, is likewise used intravenously, with proven efficacy and safety compared
with placebo and amiodarone in randomized clinical trials. The aim of our study was to compare the time to conversion
and the conversion rate within 90 min in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation treated with vernakalant or
ibutilide.
Methods
and results
A randomized controlled trial registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01447862) was performed in 100 patients with re-
cent-onset atrial fibrillation treated at the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital. Patients received up to two
short infusions of vernakalant (n ¼ 49; 3 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg if necessary) or ibutilide (n ¼ 51; 1 mg followed by
another 1 mg if necessary) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Clinical and laboratory variables, adverse
events, conversion rates, and time to conversion were recorded. Time to conversion of AF to sinus rhythm was sig-
nificantly shorter in the vernakalant group compared with the ibutilide group (median time: 10 vs. 26 min, P ¼ 0.01), and
likewise the conversion success within 90 min was significantly higher in the vernakalant group (69 vs. 43%, log-rank
P ¼ 0.002). No serious adverse events occurred.
Conclusion
Vernakalant was superior to ibutilide in converting recent-onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in the emergency
department setting.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and
is expected to double till 2060 to 18 million in the EU when com-
pared with 2010.1 It is associated with increased cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality2 and devastating stroke. Many studies
have investigated the efficacy of different drugs in converting AF
to sinus rhythm (SR). There are numerous randomized controlled
trials comparing the value of these drugs with placebo, as well as
among each other. Efficacy for acute conversion of AF was demon-
strated for ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, and amio-
darone, and there was moderate evidence for quinidine.3
Ibutilide, a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that blocks IKr, blocks the
rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current

 and activates a late inward sodium current,4 is approved for acute
termination of AF and atrial flutter of recent onset and has been
shown to be superior to sotalol5 and equivalent to flecainide6 in
this indication in two randomized controlled trials. Recently, the
relatively atrial selective antiarrhythmic agent vernakalant has
been approved by the European Medicines Agency for the rapid
conversion of recent-onset AF to SR in adults. It is recommended
for rhythm control by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
since the 2010 guidelines7 and highlighted in a recent review.8 Ver-
nakalant rapidly terminates AF through blocking of potassium and
frequency- and voltage-dependent sodium ion channels in all phases
of the atrial action potential.9 In the AVRO trial (a randomized
active-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of
vernakalant to amiodarone in recent-onset AF), vernakalant demon-
strated being more effective than amiodarone for acute conversion
of recent-onset AF10 as well as in a small single-centre trial from
Argentina, intravenous vernakalant was significantly faster in con-
verting AF to SR when compared with oral flecainide.11 Vernakalant
and ibutilide have comparable pharmacokinetic properties and are
both recommended by the current ESC focused guidelines update
for the management of AF in patients with and without moderate,
but not severe structural heart disease.7
The aim of our study was to compare the time and the efficacy of
conversion to SR within 90 min in patients with recent-onset AF
treated with vernakalant or ibutilide intravenously.
Methods
The study protocol was approved by the independent Ethics Commit-
tee of the Medical University of Vienna (EK NR: 220/2011). The trial was
conducted according to the ICH-GCP guidelines (International Confer-
ence on Harmonisation–Good Clinical Practice) as well as the Declar-
ation of Helsinki and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01447862
(EudraCT number 2011-000695-34). All subjects gave their written in-
formed consent before inclusion. There was no contribution from the
pharmaceutical industry at any stage of the trial.
Study design
One hundred patients with recent-onset AF (symptoms of AF since no
longer than 48 h) treated at the emergency department of the Medical
University of Vienna have been enrolled in this block-randomized con-
trolled trial.
Prior to randomization we performed several routine baseline and
screening examinations, which included medical history, physical
exam, standard 12-lead ECG with measurement of QT interval, trans-
thoracic echocardiography, chest X-ray, and routine laboratory testing
(including TSH and free T4).
Male and female patients between 18 and 90 years were included in
the study. Exclusion criteria were necessity for immediate electrical car-
dioversion due to haemodynamic instability; heart failure NYHA III/IV;
a previously documented left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤35%; his-
tory or signs of acute coronary syndrome within the last 30 days; a rest-
ing ventricular rate of ,80 bpm without pacemaker backup; a QT
interval of .440 ms; presence of Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome;
history of Torsade de pointes (TdP) arrhythmia or other polymorphic
ventricular tachycardias (VTs); signs of thyrotoxicosis, sick sinus syn-
drome or atrioventricular block II and III, severe valvular heart disease,
clinically meaningful hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, restrict-
ive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis; serious disorders of the
hepatic, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, haematological, or central
nervous system; serious psychiatric disorders; abnormal serum electro-
lytes despite adequate therapy; intravenous use of any Class I or III anti-
arrhythmic drugs within 4 h prior to study drug application; pregnancy;
and known hypersensitivity to study medications.
We did not include patients with atrial flutter as vernakalant treat-
ment is not indicated in this patient group due to lack of efficacy.12
Block randomization into two treatment groups with variable block
sizes of four to six was performed by an independent epidemiologist
using www.randomization.com. To conceal allocation we used sequen-
tially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes, which were produced be-
fore initiation of the study.
If potassium values were not in the high normal range (.4.2 mmol/L),
patients received a pre-fabricated electrolyte infusion (Elozell ‘spezial’,
250 mL, Fresenius Kabi, Austria) with 24 mmol of potassium and
6 mmol of magnesium prior to randomization. A total of 43 patients
(88%) in the vernakalant group and 38 patients (75%) in the ibutilide
group received this treatment.
Additionally, according to local standard of care, most patients re-
ceived 500 mL of a balanced electrolyte solution (Elo-Mel isoton, Frese-
nius Kabi Austria) intravenously, in order to increase plasma volume.
All subjects were randomized to receive either up to two infusions of
ibutilide (1 mg each in 100 mL normal saline) intravenously over 10 min
with an interruption of 10 min in-between or up to two infusions of ver-
nakalant (3 and 2 mg/kg in 100 mL normal saline) with an interruption of
15 min in-between. The second dose was given only if AF persisted
(Figure 1). Subjects weighing ,60 kg received 0.01 mg/kg ibutilide ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions, as well as for subjects

 receiving vernakalant a maximum of 339 mg for the first, and 226 mg for
the second infusion was not exceeded.
We further were interested if vernakalant pre-treatment may also
enhances electrical cardioversion efficacy as shown for ibutilide.13
Therefore, according to the study protocol, consented study patients
underwent electrical cardioversion if AF persisted 2 h or longer after ad-
ministration of first study drug dose. We attempted a series of up to
three electrical cardioversions (biphasic defibrillation, Philips HeartStart
MRx) starting with 100 J and increasing energy up to 150 J and conse-
quently 200 J (Figure 1).
Intravenous administration of ventricular rate controlling drugs
(b-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digitalis) was performed in
both treatment groups if appropriate. Patients without sufficient antic-
oagulation received 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin subcutaneously. Monitoring
included real-time 12-lead ECG, oxygen saturation, and heart rate. Add-
itionally, arterial blood pressure, QT, and QTc (Fridericia correction)
were measured every 20 min for the first 60 min; additional measure-
ments were performed after 120, 240 min, and prior to discharge. To
determine the exact time of conversion to SR, patients received con-
tinuous ECG monitoring. These traces were centrally stored in a secure
database for later analysis.
Treatment had to be discontinued according to the protocol if uncor-
rected QT interval increased to ≥550 ms or by .25% from baseline,
heart rate decreased to ,40 bpm, systolic blood pressure increased
to .190 mmHg or decreased to ,80 mmHg, new bundle-branch block
developed or QRS interval increased by ≥50% from baseline, VT, recur-
rent non-sustained VT (nsVT; defined as three or more ventricular ex-
trasystoles lasting ,30 s), a sinus pause of ≥5 s, complete heart block,
or intolerable adverse effects occurred. A serious adverse event (SAE)
was defined according to the ICH-GCP guidelines as an event resulting
in death, a life-threatening condition, hospitalization or prolongation
of existing hospitalization, or persistent or significant disability or incap-
acity. Patients were observed and monitored for at least 6 h after admin-
istration of first dosage of study drug.
Outcome measurements
Efficacy
Time to SR measured from start of first study drug administration was
the primary endpoint and conversion rate to SR within 90 min was de-
fined as the secondary endpoint. Conversion rate including electrical
cardioversion was defined as the tertiary endpoint.
Statistics
Baseline and demographic data were tabulated and informally compared
between the groups. We described continuous variables using
mean and standard deviation or median and quartiles, as appropriate.
Categorized variables were described as absolute count and relative
frequency.
Median time to pharmacological conversion was compared using the
Mann–Whitney U test. For comparison of cardioversion success, we
used survival analysis methods. Cardioversion success until 90 min
was analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method with follow-up time start-
ing at initiation of study medication and sustained SR defined as success
(15 min at least). As electrical cardioversion time was not protocol di-
rected within the first 90 min, we censored follow-up for this analysis at
90 min. We plotted 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) around the sur-
vival probabilities and compared the intervention groups using a log-
rank test. As an additional analysis, we repeated this analysis without
censoring using the follow-up time until the last success. To assess ad-
verse effects and other categorized outcomes, we calculated absolute
risk differences with exact 95% CI and used the Fisher’s exact test for
hypothesis testing. To assess other ancillary outcomes on a continuous
scale, we used the Mann–Whitney U test or t-test, as appropriate. For
heart rate, QT interval and blood pressure repeated measurements
were available. To allow for the panel structure of these variables, we
used multivariable random effects models with each of these measure-
ments as outcome, intervention group, time, and treatment–time inter-
action as covariates, and patient identifier as the cluster identifier to
estimate the difference between the intervention groups based on a
Wald test.
A two-sided P-value of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
All analyses were performed using MS Excel 2011 and Stata 11 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, TX, USA) for Mac&.
Sample size calculation
We were planning a study with one control per experimental subject,
with a follow-up time of 90 min after initial treatment. Prior data indi-
cated that the median time to conversion in the control treatment
was 25 min. If the true median time to conversion in the control and ex-
perimental treatments was 25 and 12 min, respectively, we needed to
study 30 experimental subjects and 30 control subjects to be able to re-
ject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival
curves (based on time to conversion) are equal with a power of 80%.
The Type I error probability associated with this log-rank test of this
null hypothesis is 0.05. To compensate for an expectedly large number
of missing data, we increased the study sample to 50 patients per group.
Results
Study population
From January 2012 to March 2015, a total of 209 patients were
screened for eligibility, of which 101 patients were enrolled in this
single-centre randomized controlled trial. A total of 108 patients
were excluded, whereof 53 patients did not meet the inclusion cri-
teria, 28 declined to participate, and 27 patients converted to SR
during screening phase.
The two treatment groups werewell balanced; there were no signifi-
cant differences regarding demographics and baseline characteristics
(Table 1). However, more patients in the ibutilide group had previous
ablation (7 vs. 2). This did not affect conversion rate in our studyand did
not significantly affect further analyses. Interestingly, although AF was
recurrent in a large proportion of patients, use of prophylactic oral anti-
arrhythmic drug therapy was low in both study groups.
From 101 randomized patients, 100 (49 in the vernakalant group
and 51 in the ibutilide group) received at least one dose of study
drug and were included in further analyses (Figure 2). One patient
in the ibutilide group received one study drug infusion only because
of recurrent nsVT. Another patient in this group weighing 48 kg re-
ceived weight-adjusted reduced dose according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
Another patient was erroneously randomized despite the then
unknown presence of an exclusion criteria (severe aortic stenosis).
Subsequently, no study drug was administered, no further data ac-
quisition or analysis was performed, and the patient was excluded
with replacement.
Efficacy
The primary study endpoint ‘time to conversion of AF to SR’ was sig-
nificantly shorter in the vernakalant group when compared with the

 ibutilide group [median time: 10 (IQR ¼ 6–17) vs. 26 (IQR ¼ 9–55)
minutes, P ¼ 0.01]. Likewise, the secondary endpoint ‘conversion
success within 90 min’ was achieved significantly more frequent in
the vernakalant group with 34 patients when compared with 22 pa-
tients in the ibutilide group (69 vs. 43%, log-rank P ¼ 0.002, Figure 3).
Consistently, 29 patients (59%) in the vernakalant group when com-
pared with 14 patients (27%) in the ibutilide group [absolute risk re-
duction 32% (95% CI 13–50%), P ¼ 0.002] converted into SR prior
to administration of second infusion of study drug.
Late pharmacological conversion (achieving SR 120–240 min
after study drug administration) was observed in five patients
(two in the vernakalant group and three in the ibutilide group).
There was no relapse of AF after successful pharmacological cardi-
oversion in any of the patients in both groups during the observation
period of 6 h.
A total of 39 patients (13 in the vernakalant group and 26 in the
ibutilide group) did not convert to SR within 2 h or more after start
of first study drug administration. All of them consented to undergo

 electrical cardioversion. Of the 13 patients, 12 (92%) in the verna-
kalant group underwent successful electrical cardioversion with one
shock, whereas only 17 of 26 patients (65%) in the ibutilide group
converted to SR after application of one shock. Three patients in
the ibutilide group and one patient in the vernakalant group did
not convert to SR after a series of three shocks (100J, 150J, 200J).
These patients received 300 mg amiodarone intravenously and
were successfully electrically cardioverted thereafter.
Safety
No SAE was observed within the two treatment groups (Table 2).
There were no cases of TdP, ventricular fibrillation, or poly-
morphic or sustained VT in either group. Premature ventricular
contraction (PVC), nsVT, and aberrant conduction were observed
only in the ibutilide group (8 vs. 0, 7 vs. 0, and 7 vs. 0). All but
one of these events were asymptomatic and disappeared without
therapeutic intervention. However, one patient did not receive
the second study drug infusion due to recurrent nsVTs after the
first infusion. Further treatment was not mandatory, and the
patient underwent successful electrical cardioversion in order to
restore SR.
Occurrence of atrial flutter (AFL) after study drug administration
was observed in none of the patients in the ibutilide group and in
four patients in the vernakalant group (8.2%). Three of them con-
verted successfully to SR within 90 min after study drug administration,
and one underwent electrical cardioversion in order to achieve SR.
No atrial flutter events were considered to be serious, and no pa-
tient developed 1:1 atrioventricular conduction during the episodes.
Minor adverse events like sneezing (12.2%), paraesthesia (8.2%), and
dysgeusia (6.1%) occurred in the vernakalant group only. All of these
were transient and disappeared without therapeutic intervention.
Overall, in both groups heart rate decreased over time on aver-
age. Likewise, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased within
both groups (Figure 4); however, in patients receiving vernakalant, a
slight initial increase in diastolic blood pressure occurred within the
first 20–40 min after application of first study drug dose. In both
groups, QTcF increased, however, significantly more pronounced
in the ibutilide group (Figure 5).

 Discussion
This is, to our knowledge, the first study that compared the efficacy
and safety of vernakalant and ibutilide, two anti-arrhythmic drugs
with similar pharmacokinetic properties and clinical indications
according to the current ESC focused guidelines update for the
management of AF.7
The study has demonstrated that vernakalant is significantly faster
and more effective than ibutilide for achieving SR in recent-onset AF
in the emergency department setting. The rapid time to conversion
in vernakalant-treated patients is consistent with Phase III studies of
intravenous vernakalant14,15 including the AVRO trial10 and a recent
single-centre study, which compared intravenous vernakalant
to oral flecainide.11 The efficacy of vernakalant in converting
recent-onset AF was even higher in our study than previously re-
ported in several trials. The majority of those studies observed con-
version rates of �50%, with an increased conversion success of
�60% in one post hoc analysis.16 In one recent Swedish cohort study
including 251 patients, a conversion rate of 70% was reported,
which is comparable to our findings.17 Just two small single-centre
studies from Argentina, each with 17 patients receiving vernakalant,
reported even higher conversion rates of 76.4% within 30 min11 and
93% within 2 h.18 The high conversion rate in our study might be re-
lated with the low number of patients with greater co-morbidities
(e.g. structural heart disease), the rather young patient age and
the relatively short duration of AF prior to study inclusion.
The conversion rate in the ibutilide group was in the same range
as in previous trials that compared the efficacy of ibutilide with pla-
cebo or other antiarrhythmic agents. Conversion rates of 35–51%
have been observed in those studies, with the highest efficacy in pa-
tients with atrial flutter5,19 and in patients with AF lasting ,48 h.6,20
Likewise, the time to conversion is comparable to our results (mean
conversion time of 27–33 min).19
The electrophysiological actions of the mixed ion channel blocker
vernakalant are largely characterized by frequency-dependent al-
terations of peak sodium channel currents including effective refrac-
tory period prolongation due to induction of post-repolarization

 refractoriness.21 Additionally, vernakalant acts by blockade of the
ultra-rapid delayed potassium atrial rectifier current (IKur), with con-
sequent prolongation of the atrial effective refractory period.22
These effects may explain the prominent anti-AF efficacy and conse-
quently the superiority when compared with ibutilide, which acts by
blocking the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potas-
sium and by activation of a late inward sodium current.4
The benefits of an early cardioversion and a comprehensive
rhythm control therapy23 include a reduction in the risk of recurrent
AF episodes,24 less need for electrical cardioversion,20 prevention
of prolonged and expensive hospital admissions, and might improve
overall outcome, a question addressed in the on-going EAST (Early
Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial) study.25
Indeed, significantly less patients in the vernakalant group needed
electrical cardioversion (13 when compared with 26 patients in
the ibutilide group), and duration of emergency department stay
could have been significantly shortened, especially in the vernakalant
group, if an observational period of at least 6 h would not have been
required by our study protocol. Accordingly, the cumulative time to
conversion to SR, summarizing pharmacological and electrical cardi-
oversion, was shorter in the vernakalant group when compared
with the ibutilide group [median time: 15 (IQR ¼ 8–140) vs. 124
(IQR ¼ 20–241)].
Of interest, vernakalant was at least as effective as ibutilide in en-
hancing electrical cardioversion. Of 13 patients, 12 (92%) in the
vernakalant group were successfully electrically cardioverted with
one shock of 100 J, when compared with only 17 of 26 patients
(65%) in the ibutilide group. This finding is in line with a recently
published study from Germany in which vernakalant was more ef-
fective than amiodarone in facilitating electrical cardioversion in pa-
tients with either immediate AF recurrence or failed electrical
cardioversion after antiarrhythmic-naı
¨ve electrical cardioversion.26
Both study drugs were well tolerated in our study, and most ob-
served adverse events were in the range of previous trials. Dysgeu-
sia, sneezing, and paraesthesia were comparable to the summarized
findings from the Phase II and Phase III trials of intravenous vernaka-
lant vs. placebo (dysgeusia 20.4%, sneezing 15%, paraesthesia
8.8%)27 and the AVRO trial (dysgeusia 6.9%, sneezing 3.4%).10 Like-
wise, atrial flutter occurred with the same incidence as in the AVRO
trial (8.2 vs. 8.6%).
Non-sustained VTs occurred in 14% (n ¼ 7) of the patients in the
ibutilide group. This incidence is higher as reported in previous stud-
ies with ibutilide, where nsVTs were observed in 4.9–8.3% of trea-
ted patients.19,28 In line with previous reports, QT and QTc
prolongation was particularly pronounced in the ibutilide group.19
Of interest, no patient experienced relevant arterial hypotension,
and blood pressure did not differ between treatment groups,
although hypotension is a potential dangerous adverse event devel-
oping after vernakalant administration in �6% of patients.15 This
might be at least partly attributable to our local standard of care

Vernakalant vs. ibutilide in atrial fibrillation

 intravenous fluid therapy (on average 0.75 L electrolyte infusion) in
patients with AF and the fact that just a minority of our study pa-
tients showed impaired left ventricular function, a known risk factor
for developing haemodynamic instability.
Our study has several limitations. First, we did not include a pla-
cebo group due to our concerns of leaving symptomatic patients un-
treated. Moreover, placebo controlled trials already exist for both
drugs.14,19 Second, study treatment was not blinded, so we cannot
exclude some type of bias. However, our predefined study end-
points were not prone to subjective assessment. Third, we
performed a single-centre trial and cannot rule out that local stand-
ard of care affected study outcomes. Indeed, the administration of
an electrolyte infusion to raise potassium values to high normal
values during the screening phase might be linked with the absence
of TdP arrhythmia or other polymorphic VT in our study patients.
Forth, AF duration prior the study inclusion was short, and
most of our study patients had good ejection fraction and were rela-
tively young.
Conclusion
Vernakalant was superior to ibutilide in converting recent-onset AF
to SR in the emergency department setting.
