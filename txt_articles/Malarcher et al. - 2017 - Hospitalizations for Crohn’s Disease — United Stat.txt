In 2009, an estimated 565,000 Americans had Crohn’s dis-
ease (1), an inflammatory bowel disorder that can affect any 
part of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include persistent 
diarrhea, abdominal cramps and pain, constipation leading to 
bowel obstruction, and rectal bleeding.* Symptoms sometimes 
intensify in severity and require hospitalization and surgeries 
of the small intestine, colon, or rectum (2). Hospital dis-
charge data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) of the 
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) were used 
to estimate U.S. hospitalizations† for Crohn’s disease as both 
the first-listed and any-listed§ discharge diagnosis and com-
mon surgical procedures during hospitalizations with Crohn’s 
disease as first-listed diagnosis from 2003 to 2013, the most 
recent decade of data. Despite new therapies that were expected 
to improve remission and reduce hospitalizations, estimated 
numbers (and age-adjusted rates per 100,000 U.S. popula-
tion) of hospitalizations for Crohn’s disease as the first-listed 
diagnosis did not change significantly from 2003 to 2013. 
The proportion of these hospitalizations during which small 
bowel resection was performed decreased from 4.9% in 2003 
to 3.9% in 2013 (p<0.05); however, colorectal resection and 
fistula repair rates remained stable. Hospital stays for any-listed 
Crohn’s disease increased from >120,000 (44.2 per 100,000) 
in 2003 to >196,000 (59.7 per 100,000) in 2013 (p<0.05). 
Patient education initiatives should focus on increasing aware-
ness of exacerbating factors and medication compliance to 
prevent hospitalizations.
NIS hospital discharge data, which were obtained from 
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), 
represent an annual stratified sample of 7–8 million 
hospital records collected by 37–44 participating states 
from approximately 20% of U.S. community hospitals.¶ 
Records are weighted for hospital characteristics as well as 
for patient diagnoses, age, and admission month, so that 
analyses can produce reliable national estimates. Because 
the NIS implemented a new systematic sampling design in 
2012, revised sampling weights were used for all analyses. 
Crohn’s disease was defined for a first-listed diagnosis field 
and for any of 15 diagnosis fields during 2003–2008 and 25 
fields during 2009–2013 with International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) 
disease codes 555.0–555.9. For states, the number of hos-
pitalizations in 2013 with any diagnosis of Crohn’s disease 
was obtained using the online query tool** from 35 states

† Hospitalizations or hospital stays refer to a patient being admitted to a hospital 
for one or more days.
§ First-listed Crohn’s disease diagnosis indicates that Crohn’s disease was the 
principal reason for the hospitalization. Any-listed Crohn’s disease diagnosis 
indicates that patients had Crohn’s disease, but Crohn’s disease was not 
necessarily the main reason they were being hospitalized.

participating in the State Inpatient Databases, HCUP, 
AHRQ. Denominators for all annual hospitalization rates 
by age, sex, and state were obtained from the U.S. Census 
intercensal estimates for 2003–2009†† and 2010–2013.§§ 
Direct age-adjustment to the projected 2000 U.S. population 
was performed using five age groups (<18, 18–44, 45–64, 
65–84, and ≥85 years) to calculate age-adjusted hospitaliza-
tion rates per 100,000 U.S. population and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). Because race/ethnicity was not reported for 
26% of hospital records in 2003 and 6% in 2013, these 
analyses do not include estimates by race/ethnicity. The 
percentages of first-listed hospitalizations that included 
small bowel resection, colorectal resection, or fistula repair 
were also obtained from any of up to 15 procedure fields.¶¶ 
SAS-callable SUDAAN was used to account for the complex 
sampling design of NIS. For comparisons of rates from 2003 
to 2013 and between males and females, statistical signifi-
cance (p<0.05) was determined by the Z-test.
Hospitalization rates for any-listed diagnosis of Crohn’s 
disease were two times higher than those for a first-listed diag-
nosis from 2003 to 2007 and three times higher from 2008 
to 2013 (Figure 1). Potential reasons for the sharp increase 
in hospitalization rates from 2007 to 2008 are unknown; 
however, there were no changes in NIS methodology, states 
reporting data, or diagnosis codes at that time. Age-adjusted 
hospitalization rates were higher among females than among 
males for both first-listed and any-listed diagnosis of Crohn’s 
disease (p<0.05).
From 2003 to 2013, there was no significant change in the 
estimated number of hospitalizations for Crohn’s disease as a 
first-listed diagnosis; however the age-adjusted hospitalization 
rate for Crohn’s disease as any-listed diagnosis increased 35.1% 
from 44.2 per 100,000 (120,209 hospitalizations) in 2003 to 
59.7 per 100,000 (196,480 hospitalizations) in 2013 (Table). 
As a first-listed diagnosis, there was a significant increase in the 
hospitalization rate in 2013 relative to 2003 (+14.5%), only 
among males (p<0.05). In contrast, hospitalization rates for 
any-listed Crohn’s disease increased from 2003 to 2013 for all 
groups defined by age and sex. In both 2003 and 2013, hos-
pitalization rates for Crohn’s disease as a first-listed diagnosis 
were higher among persons aged 18–44 years than among 
other age groups, whereas, hospitalization rates with any-listed 
Crohn’s disease increased among successive age groups until 
ages 65–84 years.

Geographic variations were observed in 
tertiles of age-adjusted hospitalization rates 
with any-listed Crohn’s disease in 2013 among 
participating HCUP states (Figure 2), with 
age-adjusted hospitalization rates per 100,000 
ranging from 19.2 in Hawaii to 91.6 in Rhode 
Island. States with the lowest hospitalization 
rates were clustered in the Southwest and Rocky 
Mountain states.
Among hospitalizations for a first-listed 
diagnosis of Crohn’s disease in 2013, 3.9% were 
for small bowel resection, 12.8% for colorec-
tal resection, and 2.0% for fistula repair. The 
decline in the percentage of hospitalizations for 
small bowel resection from 2003 (4.9%) was 
significant (p<0.05), but the percentages of 
2003 hospitalizations for colorectal resections 
(14.8%) or fistula repairs (1.8%) were similar 
to those in 2013.
Discussion
Stable trends for a first-listed Crohn’s disease 
diagnosis from 2003 to 2013 suggest that the 
4.3% annual increase reported for a first-listed 
diagnosis from 1998 to 2004 (3) has not con-
tinued. Although this result suggests that the 
available treatments have not increased clinical 
remissions or reduced hospitalizations, it is possible that these 
trends indicate the beginning of a reversal of the increased 
hospitalizations and surgical procedures observed in the years 
leading up to the study period. The proportion of hospitaliza-
tions with small bowel resection declined from 2003 to 2013, 
with no significant change in colorectal resections and fistula 
repairs. These trends contrast with the period from 1993 to 
2004, when rates of small bowel and right colon resection 
did not change and fistula repairs increased significantly (4). 
Resections are only performed on an inpatient basis and the 
decline cannot be explained by increases in outpatient proce-
dures; therefore, the declines in small bowel resection during 
hospitalizations might represent a decrease in clinical severity, 
possibly related to newer therapies. Hospitalizations with any-
listed diagnosis of Crohn’s disease continued to increase in 
the most recent decade. This increase might represent greater 
physician awareness and diagnosis of Crohn’s disease or more 
complete coding of secondary diagnoses by physicians.
State variations in any-listed hospitalization for Crohn’s disease 
are similar to findings in earlier reports showing state-specific 
first- and any-listed hospitalization rates during 2001–2006 (5). 
Previous studies found lower first-listed hospitalization rates in 
western U.S. regions during 1998–2004 (3), lower prevalence 
of Crohn’s disease among insured adults in the South and West, 
and higher prevalence in the Midwest during 2008–2009 (1). 
Whether this consistent regional pattern is the result of varia-
tions in physician awareness and diagnosis of Crohn’s disease or 
variations in risk factors for Crohn’s disease is unknown.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, information on hospital diagnosis and procedures 
is based solely on ICD-9-CM codes that are reported in the 
hospital record, which cannot be validated in this study and 
should not be interpreted as new incident cases. Second, sever-
ity of the condition cannot be determined for most cases, other 
than that surgical procedures were performed during some 
hospitalizations. Third, the surveillance estimates for surgi-
cal procedures in this study only represent hospital inpatient 
records and do not include procedures performed in outpa-
tient clinics, or small bowel resections and colon resections 
conducted for first-listed diagnosis codes other than Crohn’s 
disease. It is also likely that the number of hospital discharges 
for Crohn’s disease includes an undetermined number of repeat 
hospital stays for some persons. Fourth, although the reporting 
of race/ethnicity on hospital records has improved during the

past decade, the continued absence of such sociodemographic 
information from a significant proportion of records constrains 
assessment of possible disparities in this low prevalence chronic 
disease. Finally, the lack of data for every state limits the abil-
ity to detect geographic clustering of hospital discharge rates.
Diagnosis of Crohn’s disease is based on a combination of 
gastrointestinal endoscopy, imaging, and pathologic studies (2). 
Progression of treatment for a patient usually proceeds from 
aminosalicylates and corticosteroids to immunomodulators 
and other biologic therapies, and to surgery in severe cases (2). 
From 1994 to 2005, prescriptions declined for corticosteroids 
and increased for immunomodulatory or biologic therapies 
during office visits involving a diagnosis of either Crohn’s 
disease or ulcerative colitis (6).
Risk factors for Crohn’s disease are not clearly established. 
Cigarette smoking has been suggested as a risk factor and is 
recognized to increase disease severity among patients with 
Crohn’s disease (7). Upper respiratory or enteric infections, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and possibly stress might 
initiate and exacerbate symptoms and lead to hospitalizations 
(2). A major deterrent in identifying risk factors is that Crohn’s 
disease is assumed to be a low prevalence chronic disease. Large 
sample size studies, which would be prohibitively expensive, 
would be required for national surveillance systems to collect 
reliable information on the prevalence of existing cases and the 
incidence of new cases in the general U.S. population and in 
subgroups, such as children and minorities (8).
Because the cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown, it is diffi-
cult to determine what changes in public health practice could 
help prevent it. Patient education initiatives could focus on 
increasing awareness of exacerbating factors such as cigarette 
smoking and stress, and medication compliance to prevent 
hospitalizations. Professional education should continue to 
increase awareness of the signs and symptoms of Crohn’s disease 
and improve diagnosis and management.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Hospital discharges for a first-listed diagnosis of Crohn’s disease 
increased from 1993 to 2004, despite new therapies that were 
expected to improve remission and reduce hospitalizations.
What is added by this report?
Hospitalizations for a first-listed diagnosis of Crohn’s disease did 
not change from 2003 to 2013. In addition, inpatient surgical 
procedures for small bowel resection declined, whereas those 
for colorectal resection or fistula repairs remained stable. It is 
unclear whether these trends indicate the beginning of a 
reversal of the increases in hospitalizations and surgical 
procedures observed in the years leading up to study period. 
The increase in hospitalizations for any-listed diagnosis of 
Crohn’s disease might represent greater physician awareness 
and diagnosis of the condition. State-specific estimates suggest 
geographic variation in hospitalizations.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Because the risk factors are not known, public health preven-
tion programs are not possible. However, stress reduction and 
smoking cessation might be beneficial in ameliorating disease 
severity among patients with Crohn’s disease. Professional 
education should continue to increase awareness of the signs 
and symptoms of Crohn’s disease, and improve diagnosis and 
management of the disease.
