ABSTRACT
Tilorone dihydrochloride (tilorone) is a small-molecule, orally bioavail-
able drug that is used clinically as an antiviral outside the United States. A machine-
learning model trained on anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) screening data previously identi-
fied tilorone as a potent in vitro EBOV inhibitor, making it a candidate for the
treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). In the present study, a series of in vitro
ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) assays demon-
strated the drug has excellent solubility, high Caco-2 permeability, was not a
P-glycoprotein substrate, and had no inhibitory activity against five human CYP450
enzymes (3A4, 2D6, 2C19, 2C9, and 1A2). Tilorone was shown to have 52% human
plasma protein binding with excellent plasma stability and a mouse liver microsome
half-life of 48 min. Dose range-finding studies in mice demonstrated a maximum tol-
erated single dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight. A pharmacokinetics study in mice
at 2- and 10-mg/kg dose levels showed that the drug is rapidly absorbed, has dose-
dependent increases in maximum concentration of unbound drug in plasma and ar-
eas under the concentration-time curve, and has a half-life of approximately 18 h in
both males and females, although the exposure was �2.5-fold higher in male mice.
Tilorone doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg proved efficacious in protecting 90% of mice
from a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted with once-daily intraperitoneal (i.p.)
dosing for 8 days. A subsequent study showed that 30 mg/kg/day of tilorone given
i.p. starting 2 or 24 h postchallenge and continuing through day 7 postinfection was
fully protective, indicating promising activity for the treatment of EVD.

E
bola virus disease (EVD) is a severe, often fatal illness, with a mortality rate of up to
90%. It is caused by the Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the filovirus family.
Members of this taxonomic group, which also includes Marburg virus, form filamentous
infectious viral particles and encode their genome in the form of single-stranded
negative-sense RNA. Both viruses, and some of their lesser-known relatives, cause
severe disease in humans and nonhuman primates in the form of viral hemorrhagic
fevers (1). There are currently no therapeutics approved by the FDA for the treatment
of EBOV infections, indicating an important public health gap in our preparedness for
both the intentional release of this pathogen in a biowarfare scenario and a pandemic
outbreak scenario, similar to the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa (which
resulted in more than 28,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths). As recently as 2016, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported cases of EBOV infections

 in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. This year, there were 15 confirmed cases, 4 deaths,
over 1,200 contacts with these individuals, and an emergency response coordination
involving 50 health care facilities. These outbreaks are incredibly costly in terms of
human life and financial impact on the health care systems of the countries involved.
Although EBOV has been identified since 1976, there is also new information showing
EBOV can persist in some survivors for more than 18 months, sustaining the possibility
of person-to-person transmission (2).
To date there have been a relatively limited number of studies that have described
potential small-molecule inhibitors of EBOV (3–5). The current pipeline of anti-EBOV
therapeutics has been steadily increasing, although the only small-molecule drugs that
have undergone human clinical testing are antivirals targeting the Ebola RNA polymer-
ase (favipiravir [6], GS-5734 [7], and galidesivir [8]) as well as drug combinations of
existing FDA-approved drugs (GBV-006), for which there is little published information
available. Several compounds are in development at the preclinical stage targeting viral
entry, required host pathways, and innate immunity pathways (9, 10). Despite this drug
development activity against EBOV, there remain significant needs for clinically proven
anti-EBOV therapeutics and prophylactic agents. Also, combination therapies against
multiple targets is an increasingly common antiviral therapeutic strategy to both
enhance efficacy and minimize the emergence of mutation-based drug resistance (11),
and this requires further studies.
Tilorone dihydrochloride [tilorone; 2,7-bis(2-(diethylamino)ethoxy)fluoren-9-one di-
hydrochloride] (Fig. 1) is a small, orally bioavailable molecule (12) that is used clinically
as an antiviral outside the United States. Sold under the trade name Amixin or Lavomax,
tilorone is approved for use in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan for multiple viral disease indica-
tions (i.e., influenza, acute respiratory viral infection, viral hepatitis, viral encephalitis,
myelitis, and others) and is included in the list of vital and essential medicines of the
Russian Federation. Tilorone has a broad array of biological activities (13–20) and was
first reported to be a small-molecule interferon (IFN) inducer with broad-spectrum
antiviral activities (21–23). IFNs are pleiotropic cytokines with a long history of involve-
ment in the development and treatment of viral infections and can inhibit viral
replication by direct or indirect means such that combining IFNs with other antiviral
drugs is a proven clinical strategy. Others have suggested that tilorone does not induce
interferon in humans and therefore may have different activities in different species
(24). The antiviral activity of tilorone has been reported against a broad-spectrum array
of viruses, including herpes simplex virus (21, 25, 26), influenza A and B virus (21, 27),
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (28), Mengo virus (21), Semliki Forest virus (21, 26,
29), vesicular stomatitis virus (21, 22), and West Nile virus (30). Human clinical studies
outside the United States have evaluated tilorone as a treatment for acute respiratory
viral infections (ARVIs), where it demonstrated significantly improved patient outcomes
(24, 31–33). The drug also showed 72% prophylactic efficacy for respiratory tract
infections in humans (34).
Despite its history of use for myriad viral diseases in other countries, tilorone’
s
potential activity against Ebola virus was only recently uncovered by ourselves using a
machine-learning computational model (35) trained on in vitro anti-Ebola screening
data (36). The training data were generated through a collaborative drug-repurposing
program with the goal of identifying multiple classes of Ebola inhibitors with in vitro
and in vivo activities (10, 36). The Bayesian machine-learning models predicted Ebola
inhibitory activity for tilorone, which then was tested using an in vitro anti-EBOV assay

 for activity. Tilorone gave a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 230 nM (35), making
it one of the most potent small-molecule inhibitors of EBOV reported. This result is also
consistent with reports showing IFN-� inhibits EBOV infection (37).
The reported clinical efficacy of tilorone against other types of viral infections
combined with its potent in vitro activity against EBOV led us to further evaluate this
drug as a potential treatment or prophylactic measure for EBOV infections. This work
therefore describes the evaluation of the molecular properties and anti-EBOV efficacy
of tilorone in preclinical drug development models.
RESULTS
In vitro ADMET evaluation of tilorone. A significant percentage of drug candidate
attrition can be attributed to problems that arise from pharmacokinetic (PK) processes
(38, 39). It is therefore imperative that factors that determine the disposition of a
pharmaceutical compound in an organism, such as absorption, distribution, metabo-
lism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET), are assessed early enough in the drug develop-
ment process so that any potential issues can be addressed. While many of these
properties can be reliably predicted (40, 41), there is still tremendous value to gener-
ating in vitro data for drug candidates. To that end, kinetic solubility (42), CYP inhibition
(43), metabolic stability (44), Caco-2 permeability (45), and plasma protein binding (in
mice and humans) (46) all were evaluated. Tilorone was found to be relatively soluble,
has good mouse microsomal metabolic stability, suggesting it is moderately stable, has
low protein binding in human and mouse, has good Caco-2 permeability (a predictor
of absorption and oral bioavailability), and is not a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate
(Table 1). These in vitro ADME characteristics demonstrate that the drug is very well
behaved and is suitable for further in vivo PK studies.
Mouse dose range-finding toxicity. Tilorone was given to male and female BALB/c
mice in a single dose by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration to assess the tolerability of
the compound and select dose groups for pharmacokinetics studies (Table 2). The
compound was formulated in 20% Kolliphor HS 15 (Solutol) in sterile water. Clinical
observations were performed immediately postdose and twice daily up to 72 h
postdose. In the tilorone dose groups, ruffled fur, hunched posture, dehydration, and/or
hypoactivity was observed across the three lower-dose groups, whereas all 3 male (M)
and 3 female (F) mice in the 300-mg/kg of body weight dose group were found
deceased on day 1. Based on these results, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for a

doses as well.
Mouse pharmacokinetics evaluation of tilorone. Based on the dose range-finding
study results, dose groups of 2 and 10 mg/kg (well below the MTD) were selected for
an assessment of the pharmacokinetics of tilorone in mice. Both male and female
mice were administered tilorone by i.p. injection in the same vehicle (20% Kolliphor HS
15). Blood was collected from the treated mice at 5 and 15 min and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and
24 h postdose for processing to plasma. All samples were analyzed by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for drug levels with a lower
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 5.0 ng/ml.
After an initial rapid absorption phase, the tilorone plasma levels decreased through
4 h and then decreased more slowly; all samples collected at 24 h had concentrations
of tilorone in plasma that were greater than the LLOQ (Fig. 2).
The plasma drug level data were analyzed using noncompartmental modeling for
extravascular administration and sparse sampling. This allowed calculation of pharma-
cokinetic parameters for tilorone in mice with i.p. administration (Table 3). Tilorone
plasma levels reached the peak by 0.083 or 0.25 h. The elimination-phase half-life (t1/2)
ranged from 15.7 h (2 mg/kg males) to 20.8 h (10 mg/kg males). Exposure to tilorone,
based on maximum concentration of unbound drug in plasma (Cmax), area under the
concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUClast),
and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf),
increased with the dose level in both males and females. Plasma levels of tilorone were
lower in female mice, resulting in AUCinf values for male mice that were about 2.5-fold
higher than those in females. CL/F (clearance) and V/F (volume of distribution) were not
corrected for absolute bioavailability (F) and were relatively high.
Mouse dose range-finding efficacy. Tilorone then was evaluated for efficacy
against mouse-adapted EBOV (maEBOV) in mice across a range of doses. For this study,
experimentally naive BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to groups (n � 10/group)
and administered either tilorone or vehicle i.p. The virus challenge day was defined as
study day 0. Figure 3A shows only 10% of challenged vehicle control mice survived by
study day 7, with one control animal that lived to the end of the study. Ninety percent
of the mice treated with either 25 or 50 mg/kg of tilorone lived to the end of the study.
The lowest-dose group of tilorone (10 mg/kg) was associated with only 20% mouse

 survival. The clinical observations for the 25-mg/kg group showed only mild signs of
lethargy with some fur ruffling and no hunched posture (Fig. 3B). Body weights in the
25- and 50-mg/kg groups decreased slightly starting on day 4 but returned to or
exceeded the study day 0 values by the end of the study (Fig. 3C). Viral load analysis
by plaque assay as well as quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that surviv-
ing mice did not have viable virus or detectable levels of viral RNA in the sera by
the end of the study, indicating apparent clearance of the virus from the mice (Fig. 3D
and E).
Mouse treatment window efficacy. A subsequent two-dose, time course efficacy
study then was performed to determine the dosing window and narrow the minimum
effective dose (Fig. 4). This study was similar to the prior efficacy study but used only
two dose levels (30 and 60 mg/kg), and the initial drug dose was given either 2, 24, or
48 h postinfection with maEBOV. The two groups given 30 mg/kg tilorone at either 2
or 24 h postinfection both had 100% survival rates with only minimal adverse clinical
observations. The 60-mg/kg group displayed some signs of drug toxicity from the

 repeated dosing. At this dose level, the group dosed at 24 h postinfection had 100%
survival; however, the group dosed at 2 h postinfection had only 60% survival. This
unexpected result presumably is due to drug toxicity from a nonoptimal dosing
regimen leading to drug accumulation and may not completely reflect a lack of efficacy.
The 60-mg/kg group dosed at 48 h postinfection had only a 30% survival, which was
not significant and was further confounded with the observed drug toxicity observed
at this dose level. It may also be significant that all mice that died in the early treatment
group dosed with 60 mg/kg were female.

 survived to the end of the study (Fig. 4D and E). The mean viral titer of seven of the nine
mice that succumbed to disease in the vehicle control group was 3.81 � 107 PFU/ml.
Viable virus was not detected in the single survivor in the vehicle control group on day
28. Likewise, no viable virus was detected in treated animals that lived to day 28. Blood
was collected from two of the four mice that died on study in group 4 (60 mg/kg
starting 2 h postchallenge). The viral titers from the two euthanized animals were
3.30 � 103 and 3.70 � 105 PFU/ml, respectively. Blood was also collected from four of
the seven mice that succumbed to infection in group 6 (60 mg/kg; 48 h postchallenge).
Three of those mice had detectable levels of virus, with titers of 1.70 � 106, 2.30 � 104,
and 1.45 � 106 PFU/ml. Interestingly, one mouse which met euthanasia criteria (score
of 5) on day 9 did not have detectable levels of virus in circulation. All samples from
mice that survived to the end of the study were below the limit of detection or limit of
quantitation by qRT-PCR. Of the samples obtained from group 1 nonsurvivors, six
samples were positive for EBOV RNA, with a mean titer of 3.92 � 106 genome
equivalents/�l (GEq/�l). There were some individual mice where the serum was posi-
tive in the plaque assay but was below the limit of detection in the qRT-PCR assay.
Quantifiable viral RNA was not detected in any of the samples from the 60-mg/kg, 48-h
group, including the three mice which had viable virus detected in the plaque assay.
These samples were reanalyzed a second time but remained below the limit of
quantitation.
DISCUSSION
Since Ebola was first identified in 1976, there have been fewer than 500 cases
reported per year, and no cases were reported at all between 1979 and 1994. The 2014
Ebola epidemic then became the largest outbreak of the disease recorded. Multiple
countries in West Africa were affected, and the disease managed to make its way to the
United States via those infected and health workers. People can become exposed via
direct contact with blood and/or secretions of an infected person, which puts friends
and family members at an elevated risk when caring for an infected person. Healthcare
workers also have been infected frequently in medical facilities and are therefore at
great risk. Therapeutic and prophylactic agents remain a serious unmet medical need
for Ebola virus. There have been promising clinical trial results for several vaccine
candidates that are in phase III clinical studies (i.e., GSK-3390107A, V-920, and VAC-
69120), but vaccines require administration well before pathogen exposure and are
likely to be used only on high-risk populations. The monoclonal antibody cocktail
zMapp was used effectively to treat a small number of patients in the recent outbreak
under FDA Expanded Access (“compassionate use”) authorization, but this cocktail is
difficult to scale up for large treatment populations (47).
Tilorone hydrochloride is an investigational agent that has been known for over 40
years as an antiviral (21) and was the first synthetic, orally active interferon (IFN) inducer
demonstrated in mice (22, 48). There were several clinical reports published that
showed that even though tilorone was a potent antiviral and inducer of IFN in rodents,
there was a lack of correlation between IFN induction and viral protection (49). An early
study in humans also reported that tilorone failed to produce detectable IFN (24). These
results raised questions about how well low-molecular-weight IFN inducers would
translate to humans, and tilorone development was halted in the United States.
Subsequently, tilorone has been repeatedly demonstrated to be an effective IFN
inducer in humans (34, 50, 51), but the direct target of the drug and underlying
mechanisms of its antiviral activity remain poorly understood. Measurement of
tilorone’
s in vitro anti-EBOV activity in the IFN-deficient Vero 76 cell line (52, 53) showed
a lack of antiviral activity at any concentration below the 50% cytotoxicity concentra-
tion (CC50; 12 �M). These observations support the hypothesis that tilorone’
s antiviral
activity is acting through an IFN-related innate immunity pathway. Tilorone has been
shown to possess a broad array of other biological activities, including cell growth
inhibition in PC3 CDK5dn prostate cancer cells (IC50, 8 to 12 �M) (13) and inhibition
of primase DnaG from Bacillus anthracis (IC50,7.1 �M) (14), and in a mouse model of

 pulmonary fibrosis it decreased lung hydroxyproline content and the expression of
collagen genes (15). Other biologically important activities include �7 nicotinic receptor
(nAChR) agonist activity (Ki, 56 nM) (16) and activated human alpha7 nAChR with an
EC50 of 2.5 �M (17), which is a target for various central nervous system diseases.
Tilorone was also shown to have radioprotective activity (18), potent modulation of
HIF-mediated gene expression in neurons with neuroprotective properties (19), induc-
tion of the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans, delayed infectious prion clearance,
and prolonged prion disease incubation time (20).
In this study, we have shown that tilorone exhibits excellent drug-like properties
(solubility, Caco-2 permeability, metabolic stability, and CYP inhibition) and can be
labeled as a class 1 drug based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (54, 55).
These results were borne out by the pharmacokinetics data from mice showing good
half-life and exposure, although there was a sex difference upon i.p. dosing from 2
mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. Prior literature reports on the PK of tilorone were performed in a
single gender of mice and therefore did not observe these gender differences (12, 56).
These results and the maximum tolerated dose indicated that we can dose mice at a
level that can achieve drug serum concentrations above the 50% effective concentra-
tion (EC50, 230 nM) observed in the in vitro EBOV infection assay.
Our previous work has involved high-throughput screens which identified chloro-
quine, amodiaquine, and other molecules which were ultimately tested in vivo; how-
ever, most of these drugs were relatively unsuccessful at improving survival in various
in vivo models of EVD (10, 36) (Table 4). More recently, we have used the in vitro
screening data to derive computational machine learning models (35). These were then
used for further virtual screening to identify three compounds that were not previ-
ously tested against EBOV. All three compounds were found to have EC50s that were
submicromolar (35). In the current study, we have focused on the most active of those
compounds, tilorone, which was found to result in a statistically significant 90% survival
in mice at 25 and 50 mg/kg. At 30 mg/kg it resulted in 100% survival when dosed at
2 h or 24 h postchallenge.

 These results show the potential promise of using tilorone for treatment of EVD
relative to other early-stage compounds (Table 4); however, further investigation is
warranted into the mechanism of action and studies in additional higher-order animal
models that better replicate human disease. The advantage of this compound is its
availability on production scale and its history of safe human use for other antiviral
diseases (it is currently available over the counter in Russia). This represents an example
of computationally driven drug repurposing (63) and suggests the important value of
exploring medicines that are globally available and used outside the United States.
Additional preclinical development studies are needed to determine if tilorone can
ultimately become a useful drug for EVD in humans. The relatively small number of
potential drugs for Ebola underscores the need to identify additional candidates, as
there is likely to be attrition among those drugs currently in development. Tilorone
could be further investigated as a standalone drug or in combination with one of the
current clinical stage anti-Ebola drugs (e.g., FGI-106, GS-5734, and galidesivir) to provide
additional treatment options.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and reagents. Tilorone dihydrochloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO).
In vitro ADME assays. All in vitro ADME studies were performed by BioDuro (San Diego, CA).
Bioanalytical method for in vitro ADME studies. Test compounds were analyzed by reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a Kinetex 2.6� C18 100A column (3.0 mm by 50
mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) LC-20AD system. The mobile phase
consisted of solvent A (water with 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid).
The MS detection was performed by using an API 4000 Q trap system. The amount of parent
compound was determined on the basis of the peak area ratio (compound area to internal standard
[IS] area). IC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 software. The final dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
percentage was 1%.
Kinetic solubility. A volume of 396 �l of universal aqueous buffer (pH 7.4) was added to 4 �l of a
50 mM DMSO stock solution of tilorone. Wells were agitated for 4 h at 20°
C and then filtered. The
compound then was diluted to serial concentrations with DMSO, followed by serial dilutions with
acetonitrile-H2O (1:1) prior to LC-MS analysis. The calculated concentration (in micromolars) of soluble
tilorone was determined in reference to a standard curve.
Caco-2 permeability. Caco-2 cells were grown on 24-well (pore size, 0.4 �m) polycarbonate filters.
The monolayers were preincubated with prewarmed HBSS (Hanks’balanced salt solution) containing
2.5% HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 0.5 h at 37°
C. After preincubation, the buffer was removed and tilorone
was added to reach a final concentration of 10 �M. Bovine serum albumin (BSA; 2%) was added to the
receiver buffer for the study. The total volume was 400 �l for the apical (A) side and 1,200 �l for the
basolateral (B) side. For the apical-to-basolateral transport study (A-B), 100 �l each was collected from
both sides for sample analysis at the start of the assay, and then 200 �l was collected from the apical side
at 90 min (end of the study). The same time points and amounts were used for the basolateral-to-apical
transport study (B-A).
The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated from the equation Papp (cm/s) � [v(�C/
�t)]/(AC), where v is volume of the receiver cell, A is exposed surface area (0.64 cm2), C is initial donor
concentration, and �C/�t is change in receiver concentration over time.
CYP inhibition. Human liver microsome solution (0.2 mg/ml), along with substrate, was aliquoted
into a 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in 1.1-ml tubes. Study samples (containing either control inhibitor
or test compound) were into added into the tubes, vortexed gently, and preincubated for 5 min at 37°
C.
Twenty microliters of NADPH solution was aliquoted into all tubes and then vortexed to start the reaction
and to ensure adequate mixing of the NADPH. After mixing, the tubes were incubated for 20 min at 37°
C
in a shaking water bath and then quenched in 300 ml formic acid-acetonitrile solution. After quenching,
the samples were vortexed vigorously for 1 min and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 15 min (4°
C).
Supernatant (100 �l) was transferred to 0.65-ml tubes for LC-MS analysis by the bioanalytical method
described earlier. The CYP450 substrates and control inhibitors for each enzyme were 1A2 (phenacetin
and naphthoflavone), 2C9 (diclofenac and sulfaphenazole), 2C19 (omeprazole and tranylcypromine), 2D6
(dextromethorphan and quinidine), and 3A4 (midazolam and ketoconazole).
Mouse liver microsome stability. Mouse liver microsome solution (197.5 �l; 1 mg/ml protein
concentration) was aliquoted into 1.1-ml tubes, to which 2.5-�l volumes of positive-control and tilorone
stock solutions (100 �M in DMSO) were added. The tubes were vortexed gently and preincubated for 5
min at 37°
C, and then 50 �l of 5 mM NADPH or LM buffer (no NADPH buffer) was added into the tubes.
For analysis, an aliquot of 15 �l was removed from each tube at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min (no-NADPH
reaction, 0, 30, and 60 min) and quenched with 300 �l of 25 ng/ml propranolol in acetonitrile. Samples
were vigorously vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°
C. Supernatant (100
�l) from each sample was transferred to 0.65-ml tubes for LC-MS analysis. The amount of parent
compound was determined on the basis of the peak area ratio (compound area to IS area) for each time

 point. Clearance rates were calculated by the equation CLint (�l/min/mg protein) � Ln(2) � 1,000/t1/2/
protein concentration.
Protein binding in plasma. The donor sides of dialysis inserts were filled with 200 �l plasma
containing 5 �M tilorone and 0.5% DMSO, and the receiver side of the dialysis inserts was filled with 350
�l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4). The prepared dialysis apparatus was
placed in a shaker (37°
C, 100 rpm) for 5 h. Two tubes with plasma containing 5 �M tilorone also were
prepared for stability tests: one tube was placed in the freezer (4°
C) for 5 h, and the other tube was
placed in a shaker (3°
C, 100 rpm) for 5 h. Samples were collected from the donor and receiver sides of
each dialysis insert. The same volume of blank plasma was added to buffer samples and blank buffer to
plasma samples to make sure all sample mixtures contained 50% plasma and 50% buffer. Fifty microliters
of each sample was mixed with 300 �l of acetonitrile containing 25 ng/ml internal standard (propran-
olol). All samples were vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm, 4°
C, for 15 min. One
hundred microliters of the supernatant was transferred to 0.65-ml tubes for LC-MS analysis. The amount
of compound was determined on the basis of the peak area ratio (compound area to internal standard
area) for the two sides, and protein binding was determined using the equation % bound � 100 � ([area
ratio of donor at 5 h] � 5 � [area ratio of receiver at 5 h])/([area ratio of donor at 5 h] � 5). The percent
remaining at 37°
C after 5 h was calculated on the basis of the amount measured at 0°
C after 5 h.
Test article preparation for in vivo studies. Dose formulations were aseptically prepared under
yellow light by mixing the appropriate amount of test article in melted Kolliphor HS 15 (Solutol) (20%
final volume) using a vortex mixer for 30 s. The remaining sterile water (Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and
the formulations were mixed using a vortex mixer for 30 s and sonication for 15 min. The final 20%
Kolliphor HS 15 dose formulations were observed to be clear, red solutions.
In vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicity. Tilorone was administered to 7- to 8-week-old male and
female BALC/c mice (Charles River) by i.p. injection. Animals were checked at least once daily, and clinical
observations were recorded immediately postdose and then once daily for up to 72 h. Blood from the
retro-orbital sinus of mice under isoflurane anesthesia was collected in tubes containing K3EDTA,
processed to plasma, and stored frozen at ��60°
C. The drug level of tilorone was determined in
collected plasma samples using the bioanalytical method described below. The plasma drug level data
were analyzed using Phoenix WinNonlin (version 6.3) software (Certara, Princeton, NJ) to perform
noncompartmental modeling for extravascular administration and sparse sampling. The dose adminis-
tered was input to the program as milligrams per kilogram, and as a result no additional corrections for
individual body weights of the animals was necessary. Nominal times were used. Parameters determined
were time to maximum concentration of drug in serum (Tmax), Cmax, t1/2, AUCinf, AUClast, V/F, and CL/F. The
software also calculated the standard errors (SE) for Cmax and AUClast.
Bioanalytical method. The extraction method for analysis and quantitation of tilorone in mouse
plasma was 0.05 ml of an internal standard solution (50.0 ng/ml metoprolol tartrate in acetonitrile) added
to 0.02 ml mouse plasma in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. The sample vials were vortexed briefly, and then
1 ml of extracting solvent (chloroform–methyl-tert-butyl ether, 1:2 [vol/vol]) was added to all samples to
perform a liquid-liquid extraction. The upper organic layer was transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge
tubes, which then were placed in a centrifugal evaporator to remove the organic solvent. The dried
residues were reconstituted in 0.2 ml reconstitution solution (mobile phase A [0.1% heptaflurobutyric
acid in water]-mobile phase B [acetonitrile], 80:20, vol vol). Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using
a Phenomenex Kinetex Evo C18, 50- by 2.1-mm (5�) column with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. With a 10-�l
sample injection volume, chromatography was performed with the following gradient: 0 to 0.5 min (20%
B), 0.5 to 2.5 min (20 to 30% B), 2.5 to 3.51 min (30 to 98% B), and 3.51 to 4 min (98% B). Quantitation
was performed using MS/multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis on an AB Sciex 4000 Q-Trap mass
spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA). Tilorone was measured by m/z 411.3¡100.2 and metoprolol by
m/z 268.2¡116.2. The LC-MS/MS data were acquired, peak areas were integrated, the calibration line
regression was calculated, and the final concentrations were generated using AB Sciex Analyst software.
Virus strains. For in vivo experiments, a well-characterized mouse-adapted Ebola virus stock (Ebola
virus M. musculus/COD/1976/Mayinga-CDC-808012; first reported by Bray et al. [64]) was used for all
tilorone efficacy studies. All work involving infectious maEBOV was performed at the Galveston National
Laboratory (GNL) biosafety level (BSL) 4 laboratory, registered with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Select Agent Program for the possession and use of biological select agents.
In vivo efficacy clinical observations and scoring. All work with maEBOV-challenged mice was
approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch’
s IACUC and was done in accordance with all
applicable sections of the Final Rules of the Animal Welfare Act regulations (9 CFR Parts 1, 2, and 3) and
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (65). This work was conducted in UTMB’
s
AAALAC-accredited GNL BSL4 laboratory.
Animals were monitored daily by visual examination. Clinical scoring and health assessments were
performed and documented at each observation using a quantitative assessment of pain and distress
scoring system. Animals are scored based on the following observations: 1, healthy; 2, displaying mild
signs of lethargy, some fur ruffling, no hunched posture; 3, fur ruffling, hunched posture, mild signs of
lethargy; 4, ruffled, hunched posture, increased lethargy, and limited mobility; 5, moribund (ruffled,
hunched posture with reduced or minimal mobility consistent with inability to reach food or water or a
�20% weight loss).
Once animals reached a clinical score of 3, they were observed twice daily with 6 to 8 h between
observations. Animals in advanced disease (score of 4) were observed a third time. The third observation
occurred 4 to 6 h after the afternoon observation. All surviving animals were humanely euthanized on
study day 28. Mice were weighed daily through study day 7. Following this period and for the remainder

 of the study, animals were weighed every 3 days and monitored at least once per day for the
development of clinical signs.
Virus administration. Stock virus was diluted to a target challenge dose concentration of 1,000
PFU/ml such that animals received a target of 100 PFU per 100-�l dose. Virus administration was
performed via i.p. injection, and the viral dose administered was verified through plaque assay analysis
of the prepared virus suspension. Dosing was performed once daily beginning 1 h � 15 min postchal-
lenge for 8 days (8 total doses).
Viral load determination. From each euthanized mouse (with the exception of those that required
euthanasia during the third observation period as described above), blood was collected for viral load
assessment via plaque assay and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Serum was harvested for plaque
assay analysis and stored frozen (in an ultralow [i.e., �80°
C] freezer) until the conclusion of the in-life
portion of the animal study, after which samples were batch processed. Collected sera for qRT-PCR
analysis were added to TRIzol LS reagent and then stored frozen (in an ultralow freezer) until the
conclusion of the in-life portion of the animal study, after which samples were batch processed in the
plaque and qRT-PCR assays.
EBOV plaque assay. Serum samples were removed from frozen storage, thawed, and serially diluted
in filtered-sterilized dilution medium (minimal essential medium–1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
[HI-FBS]–1% penicillin-streptomycin [PS]) for analysis. Titers of samples were determined on Vero CCL-81
cells in 12-well plates by standard protocols. Briefly, log dilutions of serum samples were added to 80%
confluent monolayers and rocked every 15 min. At 1 h postinfection cells were overlaid with semisolid
overlay of MEM, 0.5% methylcellulose, 2% HI-FBS, and 1% PS. Ten days postinfection the overlay was
removed, and monolayers were stained and fixed using 10% neutral buffered formalin with crystal violet.
Plaques were enumerated and virus titers determined as PFU per ml calculated.
EBOV qRT-PCR assay. On the day of collection, harvested serum (target of 0.05 ml) was added to
TRIzol LS reagent (5� volume, i.e., 0.25 ml) and mixed thoroughly. This solution was stored frozen as
already described. For processing, samples were removed from frozen storage, thawed, and processed
for RNA extraction and purification using the Zymo Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit. RNA samples were
analyzed via quantitative RT-PCR using a Qiagen QuantiFast probe RT-PCR kit (forward primer, 5=-TTT TCA
ATC CTC AAC CgT AAg gC-3=; reverse primer, 5=-Cag TCC ggT CCC AgA ATg Tg-3=; probe, 5=-6FAM-CAT
gTg CCg CCC CAT CgC TgC-MGBNFQ-3=). All reactions were performed on a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR
detection system. For quantification purposes, an HPLC-purified synthetic EBOV RNA standard derived
from the conserved EBOV glycoprotein (GP) gene was used. For this assay, the lower limit of quantifi-
cation (LLOQ) was defined as either 1.00E � 03 GEq/�l or 1.00E � 04 GEq/�l for the various plates, as
these were the lowest standards on which both duplicate samples were detected. The upper limit of
quantification was defined as 1.00E � 10 GEq/�l, as this was the highest tested point in the standard
curve.
