ABSTRACT 
Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the joint impact of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and frequency of 
sauna bathing (FSB) on the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 
Design: CRF measured by respiratory gas analyses and sauna exposure were assessed at baseline in 
a prospective study of 2,277 men. CRF was categorized as low and high (median cutoffs) and FSB 
as low and high (≤ 2 and 3-7 sessions/week respectively).  
Results: During a median follow-up of 26.1 years, 520 cardiovascular and 1,124 all-cause deaths 
occurred. Comparing high vs low CRF, the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) 95% CIs for 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were 0.51 (0.41-0.63) and 0.65 (0.57-0.75) respectively. 
Comparing high vs low FSB, the corresponding HRs were 0.74 (0.59-0.94) and 0.84 (0.72-0.97) 
respectively. Compared to low CRF & low FSB, the HRs of CVD mortality for high CRF & high 
FSB; high CRF & low FSB; and low CRF & high FSB were 0.42 (0.28-0.62), 0.50 (0.39-0.63), and 
0.72 (0.54-0.97) respectively. For all-cause mortality, the corresponding HRs were 0.60 (0.48-0.76), 
0.63 (0.54-0.74), and 0.78 (0.64-0.96) respectively. 
Conclusion: A combination of high CRF and frequent sauna bathing confers stronger long-term 
protection on mortality outcomes compared with high CRF or high FSB alone.

KEY MESSAGES 
• 
Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and frequency of sauna bathing are independently 
associated with reduced mortality risk; a combination of good CRF and frequent sauna 
bathing may confer additional survival benefits. 
• 
In a population-based prospective cohort study, a combination of high CRF levels and 
frequent sauna bathing (3-7 sessions per week) was associated with a substantial risk 
reduction in fatal cardiovascular and all-cause mortality events compared with good CRF 
or frequent sauna bathing alone. 
• 
A combination of good fitness levels produced by aerobic exercises and frequent sauna 
bathing may have added health benefits and confer more protection on the risk of 
mortality.

Introduction 
Physical activity is well established to be associated with reduced risk of adverse vascular and non-
vascular outcomes(1). Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), as assessed by maximal oxygen uptake 
(VO2max) during maximal-effort graded exercise testing, is a measure of the level of aerobic fitness 
and an index of cardiac and respiratory functioning. It is regarded as the gold standard for assessing 
aerobic capacity(2). Cardiorespiratory fitness is consistently inversely and independently associated 
with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality(3).  An increasing broad body 
of evidence also suggests that CRF improves CVD risk prediction beyond that of traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors(3, 4). Sauna bathing, a form of passive heat therapy, is a traditional Finnish 
activity which is commonly used for the purposes of pleasure, relaxation, and wellness. Sauna bathing 
is becoming a popular activity in many other countries (5, 6) and it has been associated with several 
health benefits(7-10). Recent observational epidemiological evidence has shown that having frequent 
sauna baths was independently associated with a reduced risk of fatal cardiovascular and all-cause 
mortality outcomes(11). We have also shown that information on sauna bathing habits improves the 
prediction and classification of the 10-year risk for CVD mortality above established cardiovascular 
risk factors(12). 
Although CRF and sauna bathing, a measure of the level of aerobic fitness and a healthy 
recreational activity respectively, are both individually associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular 
and all-cause mortality; it remains unknown whether these factors interact together to further decrease 
mortality risk.  Our question was whether sauna bathing confers additional survival benefits in those 
with highest levels of fitness at baseline or not. In this context, using a population-based prospective 
cohort of 2,277 Caucasian men, our primary objective was to evaluate the joint effects of CRF and 
frequency of sauna bathing (FSB) on the risk of fatal CVD and all-cause mortality events. We initially 
assessed the separate associations of CRF and FSB with risk of each outcome in the same set of 
participants to enable direct comparisons.

Materials and methods 
Study design and participants 
Study participants were part of the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease (KIHD) risk factor study, which is 
an ongoing representative population-based study comprising a representative sample of middle-aged 
men aged 42-61 years recruited from eastern Finland. Details of recruitment methods and assessment 
of risk markers have been described in previous reports(13, 14).  Briefly, baseline examinations were 
conducted between March 1984 and December 1989. Of 3,433 potentially eligible and randomly 
selected men; 3,235 were found to be eligible, and of this number, 2,682 (78%) volunteered to 
participate; 186 provided no response to the invitation and 367 declined to give informed consent. The 
current dataset analyzed comprised of 2,277 men who had complete information on exposures, 
relevant risk markers and outcomes. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics 
Committee of the University of Eastern Finland and each participant gave written informed consent. 
All study procedures were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 
Baseline characteristics and ascertainment of outcomes 
For blood specimen collection, participants were instructed to fast overnight, abstain from alcohol 
consumption for at least 3 days, and to keep away from smoking for at least 12 hours prior to the 
assessments. The cholesterol contents of serum lipoprotein fractions and triglycerides were measured 
enzymatically (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 
separated from fresh serum samples using ultracentrifugation and precipitation(11). Serum C-reactive 
protein (CRP) was assessed with an immunometric assay (Immulite High Sensitivity C-Reactive 
Protein Assay; DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Participants completed self-administered health and 
lifestyle questionnaire for the assessment of age, smoking, alcohol consumption, level of physical 
activity, socio-economic status (SES), baseline diseases, and medication history(15). The energy 
expenditure of physical activity was assessed using the validated KIHD 12-month leisure-time 
physical activity history questionnaire(16, 17). Adulthood socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed 
as a combined measure of income, education, occupation, occupational prestige, material standard of 
living, and housing conditions, all of which were assessed with self-reported questionnaires. Values 
 6 
 
for SES ranged from 0 to 25, with a higher value indicating lower levels of SES(18, 19). Alcohol 
consumption was assessed using the Nordic Alcohol Consumption Inventory. History of type 2 
diabetes was defined as having a clinical diagnosis of diabetes and regular treatment with diet, oral 
hypoglycaemic agents or insulin therapy, fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/l, or according to self-
reports. History of coronary heart disease (CHD) was based on a previous myocardial infarction, 
angina pectoris, the use of nitroglycerin for chest pain once a week or more frequently or chest pain. 
Resting blood pressure was measured between 8 and 10 a.m. with a random-zero 
sphygmomanometer. Maximal oxygen uptake was used as a measure of CRF, which was assessed 
using respiratory gas exchange analyzers (Medical Graphics, MCG, St. Paul, Minnesota) during cycle 
ergometer exercise testing as described in detail elsewhere(13). Briefly, a maximal symptom-limited 
exercise tolerance test was performed between 08:00 and 10:00 hours using an electrically braked 
cycle ergometer. The standardized testing protocol comprised of a 3-minute warm-up at 50W 
followed by a step-by-step increase in workload by 20W/min with direct analyses of respiratory gases. 
The exercise tests were conducted under the supervision of an experienced physician and assisted by 
an experienced nurse to ensure safety. Assessment of sauna bathing was based on a traditional Finnish 
sauna which consists of dry air (10-20%) with relatively high temperature. The recommended 
temperature for a sauna bath is from 80°C to 100°C at the level of the bather’s head, but the 
temperature is much lower at the floor-level which keeps ventilation of sauna room efficient and 
sauna condition comfortable for sauna bathers. Baseline sauna bathing habits were assessed by a self-
administered questionnaire and these represented typical weekly sauna bathing sessions as well as the 
temperature in the sauna room(7, 20). The questionnaires were checked by an experienced nurse at the 
time of baseline examination. All deaths that occurred by the end of 2014 were used and were 
ascertained from hospital documents, health center wards and death certificates, and medico-legal 
reports. Outcomes were coded using the International Classification of Diseases codes.  
 
Statistical analysis 
Descriptive data are presented as means (SD) or medians (interquartile range, IQR) for continuous 
variables and percentages for categorical variables. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence 
 7 
 
intervals (CIs) for outcomes were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models, after 
confirmation of the assumptions of the proportionality of hazards(21). Cardiorespiratory fitness was 
categorised into low and high CRF based on median cut-offs of CRF, whiles FSB was categorized 
into low and high frequencies (defined as ≤ 2 and 3-7 sauna sessions per week respectively). These 
categories were created based on the distribution of the data and findings from our previous studies 
conducted on the topic(11, 13). For the associations of one exposure (e.g. CRF) with mortality 
outcomes, formal tests of interaction were used to assess if the associations were modified by the 
other exposure (e.g. FSB). The joint associations of CRF and FSB with outcomes bathing were based 
on the following four possible combinations: high CRF & high FSB; low CRF & high FSB; high CRF 
& low FSB; and low CRF & low FSB. To put our findings into clinical context, we also calculated the 
number needed to treat (NNT) associated with high CRF & high FSB using the formula proposed by 
Altman and Anderson(22): NNT (t) = 1 / [SB(t))HR – SB(t)], where SB(t) denotes the Kaplan-Meir 
survival probability in the reference group (low CRF & low FSB) at time t and HR refers to the Cox 
regression estimate comparing the exposure group with the reference group. All statistical analyses 
were conducted using Stata version 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas). 
 
Results  
Baseline characteristics 
Baseline characteristics of study participants are summarized in Table 1. The mean (SD) age of study 
participants at baseline was 53 (5) years. The mean (SD) of CRF and median (interquartile range, 
IQR) FSB was 30.3 (8.0) ml/kg/min and 2 (1-2) sessions per week respectively.  
 
Associations of CRF and frequency of sauna bathing with mortality outcomes 
During a median (IQR) follow-up of 26.1 (19.0-28.1) years, a total of 520 CVD deaths and 1,124 all-
cause deaths occurred. Cumulative hazard curves showed reduced risks of CVD death and all-cause 
mortality among participants with high CRF & high FSB compared with other groups (p-value for 
log-rank test < 0.0001 for all; Figure 1). In age-adjusted analyses, compared to men with low CRF, 
the HR of CVD mortality for men with high CRF was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.28 to 0.42). The HR was 
 8 
 
minimally attenuated on further adjustment for several established cardiovascular risk factors (body 
mass index, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, history of type 2 diabetes, prevalent CHD, alcohol consumption) 0.49 (95% CI: 0.39 to 
0.60) and remained consistent on additional adjustment for socio-economic status and C-reactive 
protein 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.63). The corresponding adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were 
0.51 (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.58), 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.72), and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.75) comparing 
high versus low CRF (Table 2). On further adjustment for FSB, the HRs for cardiovascular and all-
cause mortality remained persistent comparing high versus low CRF; 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.63) and 
0.66 (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.75) respectively. 
The age-adjusted HR for CVD mortality comparing men with high versus low FSB was 0.67 (95% 
CI: 0.53 to 0.85). The HR was attenuated to 0.74 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.94) on further adjustment for 
several established and emerging cardiovascular risk factors. The corresponding adjusted HRs for all-
cause mortality were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66 to 0.90) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.97) comparing high 
versus low FSB (Table 3). Comparing high versus low FSB, the HRs for cardiovascular and all-cause 
mortality remained consistent on additional adjustment for CRF; 0.76 (95% CI: 0.60 to 0.96) and 0.85 
(95% CI: 0.73 to 0.99) respectively. 
The associations of CRF and mortality outcomes were not modified by FSB (p-values for 
interactions > 0.10) and neither were the associations of FSB with mortality outcomes modified by 
CRF (p-values for interactions > 0.10) (Figure 2). 
 
Joint associations 
Table 4 reports the HRs for the joint associations of CRF and FSB sessions with the risk of 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Compared with men with low CRF & low FSB, the age-
adjusted HRs of CVD mortality for the following groups: high CRF & high FSB; low CRF & high 
FSB; and high CRF & low FSB were 0.27 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.40), 0.65 (95% CI: 0.49 to 0.86), and 
0.33 (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.41) respectively. The HRs were 0.42 (95% CI: 0.28 to 0.62), 0.72 (95% CI: 
0.54 to 0.97), and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.63) respectively after further adjustment for several 
established and emerging cardiovascular risk factors. For all-cause mortality, the age-adjusted HRs 
 9 
 
for high CRF & high FSB; low CRF & high FSB; and high CRF & low FSB were 0.45 (95% CI: 0.36 
to 0.56), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.88), and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.42 to 0.56) respectively when compared 
with men with low CRF & low FSB. After further adjustment for several established risk factors and 
potential confounders, the corresponding HRs were 0.60 (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.76), 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64 
to 0.96), and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.54 to 0.74) respectively.  
The absolute risk reduction of CVD mortality associated with high CRF & 3-7 sauna sessions per 
week was 0.36 during the entire duration of follow-up, which translated into a NNT of 4 (95% CI: 3 
to 7) to prevent one cardiovascular death. For all-cause mortality, the corresponding NNT was 5 (95% 
CI: 4 to 7). 
 
Discussion 
Consistent with results of previously published population-based prospective studies(3, 11), our 
findings show that CRF and FSB are each inversely and independently associated with cardiovascular 
and all-cause mortality. The associations of each exposure with mortality outcomes remained 
independent of and were not modified by one another. In our further evaluation of the joint impact of 
CRF and FSB on risk of mortality outcomes, the associations were strongest for men with high CRF 
& high FSB, followed by high CRF & low FSB, and then low CRF & high FSB. The combined 
exposures of CRF and FSB (in any combination of categories) were more strongly associated with 
mortality outcomes compared with the separate associations for each exposure. These results suggest 
a multiplicative effect of both exposures. However, the overall findings suggest CRF to be a stronger 
indicator of mortality outcomes compared with FSB. Finally, our findings suggest that the NNT for 
high aerobic fitness levels and frequent sauna bathing to prevent one death over long-term follow-up 
ranged from 4 to 5 in approximately healthy middle-aged men.  
The mechanistic pathways underlying the protective effects of high aerobic capacity or fitness 
levels (as defined objectively by CRF) on vascular and non-vascular outcomes have been discussed 
extensively in the literature and these involve both physiological and metabolic processes(23). These 
include reduction in inflammation(24, 25); reduction in oxidative stress; beneficial modulation of 
circulating cardiovascular risk markers such as lipids, glucose, natriuretic peptides and cardiac 
 10 
 
troponin T(26, 27); increase in cardiac output and the formation of collateral vessels(28, 29); and 
reductions in body weight and blood pressure as well as improvement in endothelial function(28, 30). 
Sauna bathing may confer its protective effects on CVD and mortality via several mechanisms and 
these include (i) improvement in cardiovascular function(31-33); (ii) reduction in systemic blood 
pressure(20); (iii) increased cardiac output as a result of increased body temperature which causes 
increased skin blood flow, whereas there is a decrease in blood flow to the internal organs(32); (iv) 
improvement in endothelial function(34, 35); (v) increase in left ventricular ejection fraction(34); and 
(vi) reductions in oxidative stress(36, 37); a recent study has shown that a single Finnish sauna bath is 
able to reduce the oxidative stress caused by 30 min of aerobic exercise in healthy men(36). Other 
effects of regular sauna bathing which might contribute to its risk reduction of mortality outcomes 
include positive alterations of the autonomic nervous system, reduced levels of natriuretic peptides, 
and improved arterial stiffness and intima media thickness(36, 38-40). Indeed, evidence suggests the 
responses produced by an ordinary sauna bath corresponds to that produced by moderate or high 
intensity physical activity such as walking.(41) In contrast to the training response experienced during 
physical activity, there is no active function of skeletal muscles during the sauna bathing. However, 
sauna induced increased heart rate increases myocardial workload and oxygen demand similarly to 
physical exercise. It also significantly increases the endurance of the musculoskeletal and 
cardiorespiratory system.(42) Given the common pathways postulated to underpin the associations of 
CRF and sauna bathing on CVD and mortality risk, the strong protective association observed as a 
result of the combination of both exposures (high CRF & high FSB) may be as a result of the 
multiplicative effect of these pathways. For example, it has been demonstrated that there is enhanced 
metabolism when isotonic exercise is performed during sauna exposure(43). It has also been shown 
that the heart rate response to a subsequent bout of exercise is higher when it is preceded by a 
combination of exercise and sauna than just by the sauna.(44) Though sauna exposure produces some 
adaptations that are similar to the effects induced by exercise; whether the beneficial effects of sauna 
are dependent on baseline physical or CRF is not very clear. In an investigation on the effects of sauna 
bathing on athletes, the authors demonstrated an augmentation in acute physiological responses when 
sauna exposure followed exercise.(44) In another study in which six male distance runners completed 
 11 
 
three weeks of post-training sauna bathing, study participants experienced an enhancement in 
endurance running performance.(42) Taking the whole evidence together suggests that beneficial 
effects of sauna bathing are more marked in people with good fitness levels at baseline. Further 
evaluation is still needed. 
Our current results highlight a substantial risk reduction of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality 
events in middle-aged men with high CRF levels as well as frequent sauna bathing (3-7 sessions per 
week). Though high aerobic fitness levels are well established to be linked with health benefits and 
longevity, our findings suggest that a combination of regular aerobic exercise activity leading to 
improved CRF and frequent sauna bathing has added benefits and confers more protection on 
mortality outcomes. Indeed, our absolute risk reduction estimates translate to only 4 to 5 middle-aged 
men who need to be both aerobically fit and frequent sauna bathers, to prevent one death over their 
life time. However, the NNT estimate needs to be interpreted with caution as it assumes that the effect 
of the intervention or exposure (fitness levels and frequent sauna bathing) is constant over time and 
mortality events occur at a constant rate over time(37). Sauna bathing is a well-tolerated recreational 
activity, can be used after an exercise session, and has a good safety profile(31). Sauna bathing seems 
to be safe even among patients who have recovered from myocardial infarction (MI) and patients with 
stable angina pectoris or heart failure. However, individuals who are prone to orthostatic hypotension, 
unstable angina pectoris, recent MI or severe aortic stenosis should exercise caution while using the 
sauna(31). Further studies into the biological processes underlying the protective effects of sauna 
bathing on adverse health outcomes and its added role in CVD and mortality risk prevention in 
general populations are warranted. We acknowledge that the public health implications of the current 
findings may seem limited in populations where sauna use is not common. However, given the 
emerging evidence on the potential health benefits of sauna bathing, it is expected that sauna use will 
increase in many other populations in the near future. Further research should replicate the current 
findings in other populations. 
 
Strengths and limitations 
Strengths of the current study include the first prospective evaluation of the joint effect of CRF and 
 12 
 
FSB on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk, the recruitment of a representative sample of men 
who were well characterized, the long-term and complete follow-up of the cohort, and the adjustment 
for several cardiovascular risk factors. Some limitations of the current study also merit consideration. 
Though CRF was objectively measured by VO2max, which is an accurate measure of aerobic fitness; 
sauna bathing frequency was assessed using self-reported questionnaires, which may have introduced 
the possibility of misclassification bias. The findings were based on a sample of Caucasian men and 
therefore cannot be generalized to women and other populations. There was also possibility of 
residual confounding due to the observational study design. 
 
Conclusions 
In a general male Caucasian population, a combination of high CRF levels and regular sauna bathing 
confers stronger long-term protection on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality outcomes compared 
with good CRF or frequent sauna bathing alone. However, objectively measured CRF remained the 
strongest indicator of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality outcomes.
