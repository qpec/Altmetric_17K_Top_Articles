Background-—Exposure to green vegetation has been linked to positive health, but the pathophysiological processes affected by
exposure to vegetation remain unclear. To study the relationship between greenness and cardiovascular disease, we examined the
association between residential greenness and biomarkers of cardiovascular injury and disease risk in susceptible individuals.
Methods and Results-—In this cross-sectional study of 408 individuals recruited from a preventive cardiology clinic, we measured
biomarkers of cardiovascular injury and risk in participant blood and urine. We estimated greenness from satellite-derived
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in zones with radii of 250 m and 1 km surrounding the participants’ residences. We
used generalized estimating equations to examine associations between greenness and cardiovascular disease biomarkers. We
adjusted for residential clustering, demographic, clinical, and environmental variables. In fully adjusted models, contemporaneous
NDVI within 250 m of participant residence was inversely associated with urinary levels of epinephrine (�6.9%; 95% confidence
interval, �11.5, �2.0/0.1 NDVI) and F2-isoprostane (�9.0%; 95% confidence interval, �15.1, �2.5/0.1 NDVI). We found stronger
associations between NDVI and urinary epinephrine in women, those not on b-blockers, and those who had not previously
experienced a myocardial infarction. Of the 15 subtypes of circulating angiogenic cells examined, 11 were inversely associated
(8.0–15.6% decrease/0.1 NDVI), whereas 2 were positively associated (37.6–45.8% increase/0.1 NDVI) with contemporaneous
NDVI.
Conclusions-—Independent of age, sex, race, smoking status, neighborhood deprivation, statin use, and roadway exposure,
residential greenness is associated with lower levels of sympathetic activation, reduced oxidative stress, and higher angiogenic
capacity. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e009117. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.009117.)

E
xtensive evidence supports the notion that cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) risk is affected by many features of
the built environment, such as residential characteristics and
location, proximity to major roadways, availability of healthy
food, and neighborhood walkability.1–3 In comparison, the
health effects of neighborhood green spaces have received
less attention. However, there are emerging data to suggest
that green spaces are important features of urban environ-
ments conducive to human health. Several recent studies
have reported that individuals living in areas of high vegeta-
tion display fewer depressive symptoms, but greater neigh-
borhood satisfaction, better social interactions,4 and higher

 social support.5 There is also evidence to suggest that
exposure to vegetation could have beneficial effects on
cardiovascular health. For instance, in an analysis of the
entire population of England, it was found that the rates of
cardiovascular mortality were lower in areas with higher levels
of greenness.6 It has also been reported that increased
residential green space is associated with the reduction in
both cardiovascular and respiratory mortality,7 and the odds
of hospitalization for heart disease and stroke are lower
among adults who live in neighborhoods with highly variable
greenness.8 Individuals with ischemic stroke residing in close
proximity to green spaces have survival rates higher than
those who live in less green areas.9 In addition, a temporal
decrease in tree canopy (due to emerald ash borer infestation)
was found to be associated with a progressive increase in
CVD mortality.10 Taken together, the results of these studies
support the view that exposure to greenness affects CVD risk.
Nonetheless, the link between vegetation exposure and
cardiovascular health remains weak, in particular, because it
is unclear how exposure to green spaces and vegetation
influences cardiovascular health and which pathophysiological
processes and mechanisms mediate the relationship between
green spaces and CVD risk.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for
the relationship between cardiovascular health and green
spaces.11 Neighborhood greenness and parks can encourage
physical activity and potentially shield residents from heat and
ambient pollutants, as well as lessen their exposure to noise
and roadway traffic emissions.12–15 Green spaces can also
foster social contacts and social cohesion, and thereby
promote a sense of well-being. Because physical inactivity, air
pollution, noise, and lack of social cohesion are important
determinants of CVD risk,1 it appears likely that these factors
mediate some of the beneficial health effects of greenness.
However, a leading hypothesis linking green spaces to better
health relates to a reduction in mental stress. Residents living
in greener neighborhoods have been reported to be at a lower
risk of psychological distress,16 decreased treatment for
anxiety and mood disorders,17 better mental health, and lower
levels of mental stress.18 Although these studies provide a
plausible link between green spaces and cardiovascular
health, such data are derived mostly from questionnaires
and evaluations, and objective evaluation of the underlying
biological processes that link stress to CVD are lacking. Direct
measurements of changes in stress levels, such as the
activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) are
preferred not only because they are more objective and
quantitative,19 but also because they can directly link
environmental exposures to CVD risk and susceptibility.
In humans, the activity of the SNS could be assessed by
measuring levels of catecholamines in blood or urine.19 While
plasma levels of catecholamines show high variability and
sporadic changes, the levels of these amines in urine could be
used to reliably assess basal levels of SNS activation.
Previous studies have shown that catecholamine levels in
urine are associated with depression and anxiety,20–22 as well
as perceived,23 chronic, and acute stress.24–26 High activity of
the SNS has also been related to changes in blood pressure,
thrombosis, and inflammation—conditions that by them-
selves could increase CVD risk.27 In this study, we tested
the hypothesis that residential exposure to green spaces
reduces CVD risk by decreasing SNS activation. To test this
hypothesis, we evaluated potential pathophysiological links
between neighborhood greenness and urinary levels of
catecholamines and their metabolites and other biomarkers
of CVD risk. Because preexisting CVD risk increases suscep-
tibility to environmental exposures,1,28 we studied this
relationship in a cohort of individuals with moderate-to-severe
CVD risk.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
We screened and recruited study participants from the
outpatient cardiology clinic of the University of Louisville
between October 2009 and December 2014 irrespective of
age, sex, or race. The clinic treats mostly individuals with
existing CVD or those at high risk for developing CVD. All
study activities were approved by the University of Louisville
Institutional Review Board (IRB 09.0174 and 10.0350). To
minimize circadian variability, we enrolled the participants and
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Individuals who live in greener areas have lower levels of
sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, and a better
angiogenic profile.
• Living in green spaces is associated with lower stress and
diminished cardiovascular disease risk.
• Female participants, participants not on b-blockers, or those
who had not previously experienced a myocardial infarction
show significantly stronger associations between greenness
and urinary epinephrine levels.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Persistent exposure to greenness is conducive to cardio-
vascular health.
• Evaluation of exposure to green spaces may be informative
in assessing cardiovascular disease risk.
• In particular, women or those without a history of myocar-
dial infarction may benefit by proximity to green spaces.

 acquired their blood and urine samples only between 1:00 and
4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. Prior to study procedures,
each participant provided written informed consent. We
excluded participants who were unable to provide written
informed consent, pregnant or lactating women, prisoners,
and those with lung, liver, or kidney disease; coagulopathies;
substance abuse; chronic cachexia; and severe comorbidities.
After enrollment, one participant chose to withdraw from the
study and was excluded from all data analysis.
The total study cohort included 508 participants. We
identified residential location of participants by geocoding
home addresses collected during enrollment. We corrected
addresses for spelling errors, invalid characters in the data,
and invalid or erroneous formats. We used the ArcMap9.3+
(ESRI, Redlands, CA) Geographic Information Systems soft-
ware to geocode participants’ addresses using street and
address data provided by the Louisville/Jefferson County
Information Consortium. Addresses not assigned to actual
residential locations (eg, apartment complexes and mobile
home communities) were manually located, if possible,
through zip codes, street names, and specific addresses of
surrounding residences. The data were available to study
investigators, but because these data sets consist of identi-
fiable participant characteristics and residential information,
they cannot be publicly shared, and no approval process was
established to broadly share participant data.
Of those enrolled in the study, we could not obtain the
residential location of 51 participants due to invalid addresses
provided. An additional 49 participants did not have valid
urinary catecholamine measurements. Smokers were not
excluded from the analysis, as previous evidence suggests
that smokers may be particularly sensitive to environmental
influences.29 Municipal property records show that less than
10%
of
single-family
residential
homes
at
participant
addresses (56% of participants) changed ownership within
6 months before enrollment, indicating low residential mobil-
ity among participants. However, similar data for apartment
renters were not available.
Covariates such as age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index
(calculated from self-reported height and weight variables),
and tobacco exposure (verified by urinary cotinine concen-
tration) were collected through the participant questionnaires.
Information relevant to CVD risk factors, cardiovascular
history, and medication use was collected from both ques-
tionnaire and medical records. Median household income, a
proxy for neighborhood socioeconomic status, was collected
from the US Census Bureau for 2010 at the block group
level.30 To account for the effects of area characteristics,
independent of green spaces, we adjusted our analyses for
the area deprivation index for each census block group
encompassing each participant’s residence. This deprivation
index
is
an
area-based
measure
of
neighborhood
socioeconomic deprivation that includes 17 census-derived
variables pertaining to income, education, occupation, dispar-
ity, household makeup, and housing characteristics.31
To estimate exposure to air pollutants, we measured
roadway exposure and daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5).
For roadway exposure, we measured distance from partici-
pant homes to the nearest major roadway using Geographic
Information Systems. Major roadways were defined as any
roadway segments that are traversed by >5000 vehicles per
day, as measured by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.32
Roadway density was defined as the total length of all
roadways
within
50 m
of
each
participant’s
geocoded
residential location. The average of daily PM2.5 values for all
monitors in the Louisville Metropolitan Area were collected
from the US Environmental Protection Agency and utilized to
estimate daily ambient PM2.5.33 These daily ambient levels
were then applied to estimate PM2.5 exposure on the day of
participant enrollment. Daily between-monitor variation of
PM2.5 was minimal, indicating that there is little detectible
intra-urban variation in PM2.5 levels.
Residential Greenness
To estimate vegetation exposure, we used the satellite-
derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data
from the US Geological Survey.34 The NDVI is derived from
the ratio of red and infrared light reflected from sunlight into
space, which is indicative of photosynthetic activity.35,36 NDVI
was quantified using remotely sensed satellite imagery,
collected utilizing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-
radiometer by the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration’s Earth Observing System. Summertime NDVI values in
the Louisville area at 250-m resolution range typically from
�0.1 (representing no vegetation) to 0.9 (representing high-
density forest cover). This range of values is consistent across
most cities in the eastern United States but is highly variable
between urban areas located in arid regions. However,
undeveloped rural areas surrounding urban locations rarely
harbor areas with <0.5 NDVI.
We quantified residential greenness by using the GIS
software to calculate NDVI at geographic residential locations
at the time of individual participant enrollment (contempora-
neous NDVI). Both peak9,37 and cumulative NDVI38 have been
used to examine the relationship between greenness and
long-term outcomes such as mortality or birth outcomes.
However, for our analysis, we used contemporaneous NDVI
(at the time of study enrollment) because in Louisville, NDVI
differs significantly between summer and winter months (due
to loss of leaves in winter), and because we expected a
temporal relationship between NDVI and cardiovascular
biomarkers measured in the study. To minimize atmospheric
interference common in single-point-in-time imagery, we

 collected composite 14-day imagery at 250-m resolution,
available through the US Geological Survey EarthExplorer
remote sensing data repository. For our analysis, we selected
representative 14-day composite NDVI data sets for each
month during the enrollment period and then applied to each
participant based on the date of enrollment to delineate
contemporaneous NDVI. To quantify greenness at and around
participant residences that represents both localized influ-
ences and neighborhood scales, we calculated the value of
contemporaneous mean NDVI for a circular zone with a radius
of 250 and 1000 m around the residential addresses. We
clipped the NDVI images to remove areas of pixels falling
partially outside the zone. Areas containing water, as
identified by the National Landcover Database, were excluded
and not considered in the circular zone calculations.39
Quantification of Urinary Catecholamines,
Monoamines, and Their Metabolites
To obtain reliable estimates of stress, we measured urinary
levels of catecholamines, monoamines, and their metabolites.
Urinary levels of catecholamines and monoamines and their
metabolites were measured using ultra performance liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis.40 For
this procedure, urine samples were thawed on ice, vortexed,
and diluted 1:50 with 0.2% formic acid containing isotopic
labeled internal standards. The samples were then applied to
Waters Acquity Class-H ultra performance liquid chromatog-
raphy coupled with a Waters Xevo TQ-Sl mass spectrometer
and subjected to multiple reaction monitoring analysis. The
procedure measured norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin,
normetanephrine,
3-methoxytyramine,
metanephrine,
epi-
nephrine, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, homovanillic acid,
and vanillylmandelic acid concentrations. The analytes in
urine samples were quantified using peak area ratio based on
8 point-standard curves, run before and after the urine
samples using TargetLynx software (Waters Inc., Milford, MA).
The concentration of each analyte was normalized to the level
of creatinine in the sample. Creatinine was measured on a
COBAS MIRA-plus analyzer (Roche, Branchburg, NJ) with
Infinity Creatinine Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wal-
tham, MA).
Quantification of Isoprostanes
For assessment of oxidative stress, participant urine samples
were analyzed by the Vanderbilt University Eicosanoid Core
Laboratory to measure urinary
F2-isoprostane and F2-
isoprostane metabolite among a subset of participants with
dynamic CVD risk.41 Phospholipids were first extracted from
urine samples and were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to
release free isoprostane. These free isoprostanes were then
quantified using a high-sensitivity gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry assay described before.41
Measurements of Circulating Angiogenic Cells
To assess the endothelial repair capacity and to capture the
large heterogeneity in circulating angiogenic cells (CACs), we
measured 15 different subtypes of CACs in peripheral blood.
However, because of technical reasons and because CACs
cannot be measured in stored samples, we measured CAC
levels only in a subgroup of 255 participants. These cells were
identified and quantified using a 7-color flow cytometry
procedure
on
fresh
blood
specimens
as
previously
described.42 We used the cell surface markers CD31, CD34,
CD45, and AC133 to quantify phenotypically distinct sub-
populations.43,44 The surface marker CD34 identifies stem/
progenitor cells, AC133 identifies early progenitor cells and
CD31
identifies
endothelial
cells.
CD45+
cells
are
of
hematopoietic origin. We used a combination of these
markers to identify cell subpopulations within these main
categories.

for

in Table. Residential NDVI values were divided into high
(>0.55), medium (0.36–0.54), and low (<0.36) categories
based on tertiles of contemporaneous NDVI values within a
circular zone of 250 m around the participant’s residence. We
compared participant demographics, CVD risk factors, and
biomarkers between high, medium, and low NDVI using
ANOVA or chi-squared tests as appropriate. For each modeled
outcome and NDVI metric, we grouped NDVI values into
tertiles, and tested participant characteristics from Table for
differences between tertiles. Based on significant differences
between tertiles and biological plausibility, we selected
covariates of sex, race, age, smoking status, area deprivation
index, statin use, and the density of roadways within 50 m of
the residence for all adjusted statistical models. While daily
PM2.5 was significantly associated with greenness in the
overall cohort, it was not significantly associated among the
cohort subgroups and was subsequently not included as a
covariate in the analyses.
To minimize spatial confounding, we performed a cluster
analysis to geographically define and account for 9 clusters of
participant residences based on census block group bound-
aries (Figure S1). To define each cluster, we aggregated
census block groups and identified a first cluster of 46
addresses in the central business district of Louisville.
Subsequent clusters were drawn by aggregating block groups
radially around the first cluster, beginning with participants

 residing to the northwest of the central business district, with
nearly equal numbers of participants. Eight clusters were
within Jefferson County and each cluster contained 45 to 47
participants. The final cluster (cluster 9) contained all
participants residing outside of Jefferson County. These were
segregated into a different cluster from residents of Jefferson
County because of differences in local governance, land
cover, residential characteristics, and so on.
We used generalized estimating equations for clustered
data to estimate the associations between plasma and urinary
biomarkers with contemporaneous NDVI values within a
circular zone of 250 m and 1 km around the participant’s
residence. Because the plasma and urinary biomarkers had
positive values and were positively skewed, we used the
gamma distribution with the log-link function. For each model,
% change (and 95% confidence interval) for each biomarker
was calculated per 0.1 NDVI. We also calculated predicted
values from the generalized estimating equation for the
epinephrine model with contemporaneous NDVI at 250 m. We
then log-transformed and determined the best fits of the data
by linear regression with 95% confidence limits and 95%
predictions limits. We performed all statistical analyses using
SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and
Graphpad Prism, version 7 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Results
Participant Characteristics
Of the 508 participants recruited for the study, 408 met our
inclusion criteria. These participants were 52% males, 56%
whites, 39% blacks, and 5% other races. A majority of the study
population was hypertensive (75%), hyperlipidemic (60%), and
at risk for CVD (61%), based on a Framingham Risk Score of
>20% or having a previous major adverse cardiovascular event.
The cohort was 51.4�10.8 years old and mostly overweight or
obese with a mean body mass index of 32.9�8.2 (see Table).
Most participants lived in areas of low greenness located in
northwestern Jefferson County. A less dense, but relatively
even, distribution of participants was observed throughout the
residential areas in the rest of the county (Figure 1). However, a
majority of the participants lived in neighborhoods consisting of
single-family residential homes and lots containing both
grasses and trees. The distribution of the study population
between areas of low, medium, and high contemporaneous
greenness is shownin Table. Black participants were more likely
to reside in areas with lower greenness. In comparison with
those living in areas of high greenness, participants residing in
areas of low greenness were more likely to live in a deprived
area and have significantly lower median household income. No
significant differences were observed in cardiovascular history,
medication use, sex, body mass index, or the sum of CVD risk
factors, although individuals living in areas of low greenness
were more likely be younger, to smoke, and to have slightly
lower plasma high-density lipoprotein levels. Spearman corre-
lations between continuous demographic variables and NDVI
within circular zones of 250 m and 1 km around the partici-

Catecholamine Levels
In fully adjusted models, the NDVI levels within a circular zone
of 250 m radius around the residence were inversely
associated
with
urinary
levels
of
epinephrine
(�6.9%
change/0.1 unit NDVI difference; 95% confidence interval,
�11.5; �2.0, P=0.006), but not with the urinary levels of
norepinephrine or other catecholamines, monoamines, or
their
metabolites
(Figure 2A).
The
association
between
urinary epinephrine and NDVI remained significant even when
the radius of the residential zone was increased to 1 km
(Figure 2B). The urinary levels of epinephrine displayed a log-
linear dose dependence with NDVI (Figure 2C). Subgroup
analysis showed a stronger relationship between NDVI and
epinephrine among females, those not using b-blockers, and
those who had not previously experienced a MI (Figure 2D).
Association Between Greenness and
Isoprostanes
Given our observation that residential proximity to greenness
is associated with lower levels of urinary epinephrine, we next
examined changes in oxidative stress among a subset of
participants with dynamic CVD risk (n=82) with demographic
features similar to the parent cohort (Table S2). In this
subgroup, we found that greenness, in fully adjusted models,
was inversely associated with urinary levels of F2-isoprostane,
a sensitive and robust indicator of lipid peroxidation and
systemic oxidative stress45 (Figure 3). F2-isoprostane levels
were inversely associated with 250 m NDVI, �9% (95%
confidence interval, �15.1, �2.5; P=0.007) per 0.1 unit. This
association remained significant within a 1-km-radius circular
zone around the participant’s residence.
Association Between Greenness and Circulating
Angiogenic Cells
To measure endothelial repair capacity, we examined changes
in circulating angiogenic cells, a subpopulation of blood cells
that are recruited from the bone marrow to promote and
facilitate tissue angiogenesis,46 in a subgroup similar to the
parent cohort (Table S3, n=255). As shown in Figure 4A, in
fully adjusted models, CAC subtypes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11
12, 13, and 15 were inversely associated with NDVI values at

 250 m, whereas subtypes 4 and 14 were positively associ-
ated with NDVI. These associations were particularly robust,
with the effect size of inverse associations ranging from
�8.0% to �15.6%, while positive associations were 45.8% and
37.6%. Within a 1-km radius, CAC subtypes 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10,
12, and 15 remained inversely associated with effect sizes of
�6.9% to �10.1%, as shown in Figure 4B. Positive associa-
tions were again found within a 1-km radius for CAC 4 and 14,
with similarly attenuated effect sizes of 31.1% and 29%,
respectively.
Discussion
In this study, we found that the residential proximity to
vegetation was associated with cardiovascular health as
reflected by a range of biomarkers of cardiovascular injury
and disease risk. Our results show that those who lived in
greener surroundings had lower levels of sympathetic activa-
tion, oxidative stress, and a better angiogenic profile than
those living in less green areas. This relationship was
independent of sex, race, age, smoking status, neighborhood
deprivation index, statin use, and roadway exposure. Although
the mechanisms underlying the beneficial vascular effects of
greenness remain obscure, these observations support the
notion that exposure to green spaces could have salutary
effects on cardiovascular health.
Previous studies have reported that environments rich in
vegetation are associated with lower CVD mortality in that
area.6,7 Similarly, greenness has been reported to be asso-
ciated with improved recovery from major adverse cardiovas-
cular events9 and lower all-cause mortality.38 However,
despite this evidence, the mechanisms underlying the asso-
ciation between greenness and cardiovascular health have
remained largely speculative. Some investigators suggest that
green surroundings support cardiovascular health by decreas-
ing exposure to air pollution and encouraging physical activity,
while others have found a link between residential proximity
to greenness and better mental health.11 Adding to this body

County, Kentucky. Study participants (n=408) from indicated residential areas were recruited from a
preventive cardiology clinic at the University of Louisville. Values of greenness, calculated as peak
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are shown at a resolution of 250 m. Attributes of land cover
and greenness within the county vary between �0.1 and 1 NDVI unit. Low NDVI values are associated with
business districts, industrial areas, and transportation zones. Residential areas show moderate NDVI,
whereas urban parks, forests, and underdeveloped areas show high NDVI values. To protect participant
privacy, exact residential locations are geographically masked and do not represent residential addresses.

 of knowledge, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of
greenness may be attributable, at least in part, to a favorable
neurohormonal profile associated with diminished oxidative
stress, and a pro-angiogenic state. These findings are
consistent with the results of previous studies showing that
residential greenness is inversely associated with stress,
anxiety, and mood disorders—a spectrum of mental states
that are associated with the activation of the SNS and the
hypothalamus-pituitary axis.11,47 In prior work, chronic con-
ditions such as depression and anxiety have been linked to an
increase in urinary norepinephrine levels,20 whereas an
increase in both urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine has
been found to be associated with low socioeconomic status48
and stress attributable to unemployment.49 Because in our
study greenness was associated with reduced levels of
epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, it seems unlikely that

 exposure to greenness is associated with lower levels of
anxiety and depression or reflective of chronic stress
associated with low socioeconomic status.
Elevated levels of catecholamines in the urine have been
linked to high CVD burden,50 and given the CVD risk of our
cohort, it is possible that the association between urinary
epinephrine levels and greenness is simply a reflection of a
difference in CVD burden. However, this seems unlikely
because patients with CVD risk have higher norepinephrine
and lower epinephrine levels,50 a profile inconsistent with our
results.
Similarly,
association
between
epinephrine
and
greenness could not be explained by difference in traditional
cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure51 or
lipids,52 which are not usually associated with a sole increase
in urinary epinephrine levels. Nonetheless, our results are
consistent with the view that exposure to greenness results in
either lower levels of perceived stress23 or better sleep53 and
circadian alignment54—conditions that are associated with
lower levels of urinary epinephrine but not norepinephrine.
The results of our study show that the association between
greenness and reduced epinephrine levels were more pro-
nounced in females than in males. This is consistent with
previous work showing an association between exposure to
greenness and mortality in women.38 We also found that the
influence of greenness on epinephrine levels was attenuated in
those taking b-blockers and those who had previously
experienced an MI. These findings suggest that greenness
has stronger effects on catecholamine levels in those who are
healthier or with low to moderate CVD risk, but that these
effects may be attenuated in individuals with frank CVD.

 capacity to repair blood vessels than those who live in less green
areas. This is consistent with previous work reporting better
recovery from cardiovascular events in individuals who live near
more green spaces.9 Nevertheless, higher levels of angiogenesis
are likely also to promote tumor growth, and therefore the
association between greenness and angiogenesis needs further
exploration and better assessment for its overall contribution to
the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.
Our analyses showed that the NDVI levels were positively
associated with circulating hemangiogenic (CD45+/CD34+)
cells but inversely associated with endothelial progenitors
(CD45dim/CD34+/CD31+) (Figure 5). In comparison with
CD45dim/CD34+ cells, the CD45+/CD34+/CD31+ cells are
more primitive, demonstrate strong paracrine signaling,55 and
have superior regeneration properties.56 Classified by some
investigators as hematopoietic stem cells or hematopoietic
stem progenitor cells,57,58 these cells are neither hematopoi-
etic nor mesenchymal in origin, as they can differentiate into
endothelial cells, osteoblasts, muscle, and neural cells.59
Although these cells do not populate the bone marrow,59 they
express Oct4 and Nanog in abundance similar to that of
undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.60 Therefore, the pos-
itive association of CD45+/CD34+/CD133+ cells with resi-
dential greenness further supports the notion that living next
to green spaces is associated with an improved wound-
healing response and reparative capacity.
Strengths and Limitations
This study is the first of its kind to assess the impact of
residential greenness with individual-level data on biomarkers of
CVD risk in a moderate-sized cohort of participants. Our analysis
focused on comprehensive evaluation of risk factors as well
as identification of underlying mechanistic changes in cate-
cholamines, circulating angiogenic cells, and oxidative stress.
For exposure assessment, we used NDVI, a common satellite-
derived metric of greenness, which is highly indicative of the
coverage and density of photosynthetically active vegetation.
Moreover, we examined residential area average NDVI values in
circular zones with both 250-m and 1-km radii that were
contemporaneous to participant enrollment. Furthermore, the
study cohort included participants with a wide range of
greenness exposure. Major covariates were accounted for via
questionnaire, as well as clinical, demographic, and environ-
mental assessments to account for socioeconomic and envi-
ronmental factors known to be highly associated with
greenness.
Despite these strengths, the study has some limitations.
First, we did not estimate specific environmental exposures.
However, our analysis was adjusted for density of roadways
near participant residence, a metric of roadway-based pollu-
tion and noise. Other influences on health that may be
affected by nearby greenness, such as psychosocial stress,

were measured in 255 participants and examined for their association with levels of greenness (as
estimated by normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) within a circular zone of a 250-m radius of their
residence while adjusting for covariates. CACs inversely associated with NDVI values are shown in filled
black boxes, whereas those positively associated with NDVI are shown in white boxes. Cells showing no
significant association are in gray boxes.

 health behaviors, and heat regulation, were not accounted for
in the study. Our findings are generalizable to a large portion of
the overall population with elevated risk for CVD but may not
be applicable to healthier populations. Although potential
confounders such as race, smoking, and sex were considered,
these variables cannot fully account for nuances of socioeco-
nomic status, environmental exposures, and genetic variation,
which likely could lead to residual confounding. We addressed
issues of spatial autocorrelation and residual confounding by
using generalized estimating equations to account for poten-
tial clustering of participants and environmental features. This
cluster area adjustment partially accounts for spatially corre-
lated but unavailable factors that could potentially confound
the associations between NDVI and study outcomes. Some
covariate data including height and weight relied solely on self-
reported data and may be subject to inaccurate reporting.
While the study did utilize NDVI, a measure highly indicative of
vegetation, it cannot account for leaf area, biomass density,
height, overlapping vegetation layers, speciation, and other
important characteristics of greenness. NDVI also cannot
account for differences in perceptions of nearby residents of
greenness quality or utility. Furthermore, only greenness
around residences was assessed, accounting for a large but
incomplete portion of participants’ overall whereabouts. For
assessing changes in catecholamine levels, we measured
urinary levels of catecholamines and their metabolites only at
one time during the day. In most such studies, 24-hour urine
collection is used to estimate total catecholamine production.
However, a spot urine collection was preferred to prevent
“averaging” out of the levels of catecholamines such as
epinephrine, which show large circadian variations.54 Urine
was collected during a similar time window (afternoon) for
most participants, to minimize circadian variation. Finally,
because of the cross-sectional design of this study, causality
of the link between greenness and cardiovascular health
cannot be established. To further understand these associa-
tions, prospective longitudinal studies are needed to assess
the role of hypothesized mediators of relationships between
greenness and cardiovascular outcomes.

 Figure S1. Residential area block group clusters. 
 
 
 
 
 
Clusters are based on aggregation of census block groups to distinguish areas of unique geographic, 
demographic, and environmental features. Clusters 1-8 contain 45-47 participants. Cluster 0 consists of 
all 40 included participants that resided outside of Jefferson County, Kentucky. Locations displayed are 
an approximation of overall participant distribution and do not represent residential locations of individual 
participants.
