Infectious diseases are mostly explored using reductionist approaches despite repeated
evidence showing them to be strongly influenced by numerous interacting host and envir-
onmental factors. Many diseases with a complex aetiology therefore remain misunderstood.
By developing a holistic approach to tackle the complexity of interactions, we decipher the
complex intra-host interactions underlying Pacific oyster mortality syndrome affecting
juveniles of Crassostrea gigas, the main oyster species exploited worldwide. Using experi-
mental infections reproducing the natural route of infection and combining thorough mole-
cular analyses of oyster families with contrasted susceptibilities, we demonstrate that the
disease is caused by multiple infection with an initial and necessary step of infection of
oyster haemocytes by the Ostreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 µVar. Viral replication leads to the
host entering an immune-compromised state, evolving towards subsequent bacteraemia by
opportunistic bacteria. We propose the application of our integrative approach to decipher
other multifactorial diseases that affect non-model species worldwide.

or decades, methodological limitations have restricted the
study of infectious diseases to simplified experimental
pathosystems in which the influences of host and pathogen
diversity and biotic and abiotic environments have been mini-
mized. Such reductionist approaches have made diseases with
complex aetiologies difficult to characterize. Thus, there is an
incomplete understanding of diseases in which a conserved
consortium of micro-organisms co-operates to induce patho-
genesis, diseases involving pathogens that cause immune defi-
ciency followed by secondary infections, and diseases that are
influenced by a series of host and environmental factors.
There is a lack of understanding of some diseases triggering
recurrent mass mortalities in non-model species of ecological
and/or economic interest, such as pollinators, corals and marine
molluscs1–3. These dramatic epizooties remain incompletely
characterized because epidemiological descriptions require hol-
istic approaches to decipher the whole pathosystem.
The objective of the present work was to examine one disease
of complex aetiology affecting one of the most utilized inverte-
brate species in the world, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas,
applying a holistic approach to decipher the phenomenon. This
species has been introduced from Asia to numerous countries
and is now the main farmed oyster species worldwide4. Intro-
duced to France in the 1970s, C. gigas suffers mass mortalities
associated with complex interactions between the host, the
environment and pathogens5. The severity of these mortality
outbreaks has dramatically increased since 2008. They mainly
affect juvenile stages, decimating up to 100% of young oysters in
French farms6. In recent years, this mortality syndrome, called
Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS)7, has become pan-
zootic, being observed in all coastal regions of France and
numerous other countries worldwide6,8.
Research efforts have revealed a series of factors contributing to
the disease, including infectious agents interacting with seawater
temperature and oyster genetics6,9–14. The dramatic increase in
mortality since 2008 coincided with the recurrent detection of
Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1) variants in moribund oysters both
in France14–16 and worldwide6,17–20. This increase has naturally
driven research efforts to focus on the viral aetiology of the dis-
ease. However, the involvement of other aetiological agents is
suspected. In particular, strains assigned to the genus Vibrio have
been shown to be associated with the disease21. Among these, a
Vibrio crassostreae population carrying a plasmid required for
virulence has been repeatedly identified in diseased oysters22.
Recent studies have also proposed that the stability of the natural
bacterial microbiota, which is abundantly present in healthy
oysters, influences their resistance to stress, or invasion by
pathogens23,24. However, the roles of host genetics, pathogens,
and opportunistic and commensal microbes have been studied
with a focus on a restricted number of factors tested in
isolation10,21–27. Thus, the dynamics, relative weight and inter-
actions of these different parameters in the disease remain to be
established.
In the present study, we concomitantly characterize the
transcriptional responses of oysters and the dynamics of their
associated micro-organisms after exposure to an infectious
environment using an experimental infection system that repro-
duced the natural route of infection in biparental families of
oysters selected to display contrasted phenotypes (susceptible vs.
resistant). This holistic approach allows us to establish that
OsHV-1 replication in haemocytes is the initial step of the
infectious process leading to an immune-compromised state of
the host, which evolves towards subsequent bacteraemia by
opportunistic bacteria. By identifying critical intra-host interac-
tions between micro-organisms and host immunity, this study
cracks the code of POMS.
Results
Production of oyster families with contrasted phenotypes. To
characterize the complex dynamics determining the outcome of
Pacific oyster mortality syndrome, we produced 15 biparental
oyster families with highly contrasted resistance phenotypes with
regard to the disease. These families were produced from genitors
that had experienced different selective filters. The genitors hav-
ing experienced a high level of natural selection by the disease
were either wild oysters collected from farming areas or
oysters issued from mass selection programmes28. The genitors
that had experienced low-level natural selection were wild oysters
recruited outside farming areas (Supplementary Table 1). The
juvenile offspring of the 15 biparental families produced were
subjected to an ‘natural’ experimental infection mimicking dis-
ease transmission in the wild12,13,29 (Supplementary Fig. 1). High
variability in the dynamics of mortalities and percentages
of survival (ranging from 0 to 97.4% at 330 h post-infection) were
observed among families (Fig. 1). Two families showing highly
contrasted phenotypes, Susceptible Family 11 (SF11) and Resistant
Family 21 (RF21) (Mantel–Cox log-rank test, p < 0.0001), were
selected for the first set of molecular and histological analysis.
During the experimental infection, SF11 oysters mortality began at
66 h and increased dramatically. At the end of the experiment
(330 h), only 0.7% of SF11 oysters had survived. In contrast,
almost all oysters of the RF21 family (97.4%) survived following
exposure to the same infectious environment. The survival rates
of SF11 and RF21 oysters were also measured concomitantly in a
batch of oysters left on oyster farms; they showed identical
phenotypes, with 2 and 98.1% survival after 384 h of exposure to
the infectious environment for SF11 and RF21, respectively. These
results confirm that the disease that developed in our experi-
mental set-up resembles the disease contracted in the natural
environment with the same outcomes. Thereafter, the dynamics
of the disease in SF11 and RF21 oysters were investigated by
thorough molecular analyses.
OsHV-1 µVar infection occurs early in disease development.
OsHV-1 load and transcriptional activity were monitored in
SF11 and RF21 oysters throughout the experiment using qPCR
and RNA-seq, respectively (Fig. 2a). Whereas OsHV-1 DNA and
RNA were detected in both families as early as 12 h after the
beginning of experimental infection, very intense replication
occurred in SF11 oysters, with DNA and RNA levels 3-log higher

 than in RF21 oysters at 24 h after exposure initiation (Fig. 2a). The
time-course of OsHV-1 ORF expression is shown in Supple-
mentary Fig. 2 for both oyster families. In SF11 oysters, the
maximum viral load and transcriptional activity were reached at
48 h and remained stable until the first deaths (at 66 h). The viral
load remained low in RF21 throughout the experiment without
any remarkable mortality until the end of the experiment (330 h).
Alignment of the Illumina reads to the OsHV-1 genome available
in the NCBI database30 revealed that the virus used in our
experiments corresponded to an OsHV-1 µVar variant, as indi-
cated by (i) the deletion of 3 ORFs (ORF36, ORF37 and part of
ORF38), (ii) the deletion of an adenosine upstream of ORF43 and
(iii) a 12-nt deletion in the microsatellite locus H10, which are
shared characteristics of µVar variants14,20,31. These variants have
been associated with mass mortalities of juvenile oysters since
20086,14,20,32. Taken together, these results show that OsHV-1
µVar infection occurs in both families, but only RF21 oysters
successfully control viral replication.
Dysbiosis and bacteraemia occur in susceptible oysters. To
investigate the dynamics of oyster microbiota in the two families
showing contrasting resistance to the disease, we analysed
total bacterial communities using 16S rDNA metabarcoding over
the first three days of the experiment. Overall, 6,061,881 clusters
were obtained from 42 libraries (2 families, 7 sampling times, in
triplicate).
After

steps
and
singleton
filtering,
4,238,989 sequences affiliated with 10,080 OTUs were kept for
further analyses (Supplementary Data 1). A sufficient sequencing
depth was confirmed by species richness rarefaction curves
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Changes in microbiota composition
(Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5) were much
higher in SF11 oysters than in RF21 oysters throughout the
experiment. Indeed, 105 OTUs significantly differed in terms of
relative proportions in SF11 oysters, as opposed to 0 in RF21
oysters (Supplementary Fig. 5). A principal coordinate analysis
(PCoA) of the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix (beta diversity)
consistently revealed a higher microbiota dispersion in the SF11
family (multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions, d.f. = 1; p
= 0.016) than in the RF21 family (Fig. 3a). This disruption of the
bacterial community structure occurred in SF11 oysters between
24 h and 48 h concomitantly with the active replication of OsHV-
1 µVar. Similarly, the Chao1 and Shannon’s H indexes of alpha
diversity increased significantly in the SF11 family during the
infectious process (Chao1: analysis of variance (ANOVA), d.f. =
6; p = 1.39e-07 and Shannon’s H index: ANOVA, d.f. = 6; p =
3.54e-05), whereas they remained stable in the RF21 family
(Supplementary Fig. 6). All the bacterial genera that changed
significantly over the ‘natural’ experimental infection in SF11 and
RF21 oysters are reported in Supplementary Data 2. Among these
modified genera, those representing more than 4% of the bacteria
in at least one sample of SF11 oysters are shown in Fig. 3b. The
corresponding OTUs, which represent only 2.07% of the total
bacteria at the beginning of the experiment, represent 59.07% of
the SF11 bacterial community at 72 h, when the first mortalities
occurred. Some of these OTUs were assigned to the genera Vibrio
and Arcobacter, which have been previously associated with
oyster mortalities22,24. In contrast, in RF21 oysters, the same taxa
did not vary significantly over time (Supplementary Fig. 7 and
Supplementary Data 2).
In addition, a significant increase in total bacterial abundance
was observed in SF11 oysters only, which started at 48 h
and continued to rise until the end of the experiment (ANOVA,
d.f. = 6; p < 0.0001; Fig. 2b). Compared with T0, the total bacteria
were 13- and 17-fold higher at 60 h and 72 h, respectively,
suggesting a massive bacterial proliferation in SF11 oysters.
Simultaneously, we observed a high increase in total Vibrio load
and abundance of Vibrio crassostreae, a previously characterized
bacterial pathogen of oysters associated with the disease21,22
(Fig. 2c, d). Accordingly, histological analyses revealed bacterial

 colonization and tissue damage in SF11 oyster histological sections
(Fig. 4). At 54 h, bacterial accumulation accompanied by
infiltrating haemocytes was visible in different areas both inside
and outside the gill tissues (Fig. 4a). At 78 h, the gill tissue
structure was completely disrupted and bacteria had spread
throughout the body (Fig. 4b, c, d and Supplementary Fig. 8). In
contrast, in RF21 oysters, total bacteria and vibrios remained low
and stable (Fig. 2b–d), and no tissue damage or tissue
colonization by bacteria were observed at any sampled time
point (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Resistant oysters display an early antiviral response. To identify
key host factors controlling the infection, we compared the
transcriptomic responses of SF11 and RF21 oysters by RNA-seq
over the time-course of the ‘natural’ experimental infection. In
total, the sequencing of 42 samples (2 families, 7 sampling
times, in triplicate) yielded between 20.4 and 32.3 million
Illumina paired reads per sample; 69.7–75.3% of them mapped
to the C. gigas V9 reference genome. RNA-seq results were
validated by RT-qPCR on 30 genes at all sampling times in both
oyster families (r² = 0.936) (Supplementary Fig. 9). The tran-
scriptomic responses of SF11 and RF21 oysters can be divided
into two phases: an early response (before 24 h) and a later
response (24 h to 72 h) (Fig. 5a). In the early response, the total
number of differentially expressed genes was higher in RF21 than
in SF11 oysters (Fig. 5a). To gain access to the functions enriched
during this early phase, we used gene ontology (GO) enrichment
analyses (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10). At these time
points, transcriptomes of RF21 oysters were more enriched in
functional categories related to immunity than SF11 tran-
scriptomes (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10). Among those
genes, 40.9% were involved in antiviral defence (Supplementary

sections of SF11 oysters sampled at different time points to visualize tissue colonization by bacteria. Oyster tissues and cells were coloured in shades of pink
to purple, and most bacteria appeared in deep blue (scale bars corresponds to 20 µM). a At 54 h after the beginning of the ‘natural’ experimental infection,
bacteria accumulated in the gills of the SF11 oysters (filled arrowheads). Rounded cells reminiscent of haemocytes were found in both gill tissues and
outside tissues in the vicinity of the bacteria (open arrowheads). At 78 h, gill tissues appeared massively degraded, and bacteria were found in most tissues
of the SF11 oysters, e.g., in b gills, c adductor muscle and d interstitial tissues near the digestive tract. No bacteria or tissue damage were observed on
sections of SF11 or RF21 either at the beginning of the experimental infection or at any time points for the RF21 oyster sections (Supplementary Fig. 8)

and cGAS) and JAK/STAT (e.g., STAT and SOCS2) pathways,
antiviral effectors (e.g., IFI44, Viperin and SAMHD-1) and pro-
teins involved in the apoptosis (e.g., TNF and caspase-3) and
maintenance of cellular homoeostasis under viral infection (e.g.,
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase). Taken together, these data show
that the antiviral response is more intense in RF21 oysters than in
SF11 oysters during the first 12 h following exposure to the
examined infectious environment.
The antiviral response of susceptible oysters is inefficient.
During the second phase of the response (after 24 h), SF11 oysters
displayed a major reprogramming of their transcriptome, with
significant changes in the expression of 9426 genes (33.6% of the
transcriptome, Fig. 5a) and a large number of enriched functional
categories as determined by GO enrichment analyses (Fig. 5c and

ming was not observed in RF21 oysters (Fig. 5a, c). During this

Fig. 5 The resistant RF21 oysters display an early antiviral response that is delayed in the SF11 susceptible oysters. a The number of genes that were
differentially expressed during the ‘natural’ experimental infection was higher in RF21 (green) than in SF11 (blue) oysters before 24 h (early response). This
trend was reversed after 24 h and until the end of the infection (late response). Upregulated genes are represented as filled coloured bars and

 Fig. 5c) were strongly enriched in SF11 oysters. However, this
intense antiviral response was inefficient, as the replication of the
virus in SF11 oysters was very high at these time points (Fig. 2a).
Among the functional categories that were highly induced in SF11
oysters only, we found the negative regulation of cell death
category to be of particular interest (Supplementary Data 4). We
performed a detailed analysis of the expression of the corre-
sponding genes encoding endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis
proteins (IAPs and Baculoviral IAPs, Fig. 6). These genes were
found to be highly induced in SF11 oysters, but only from 24 h to
the end of the experimental infection. In addition, viral tran-
scriptome analysis revealed an over-representation of viral tran-
scripts encoding putative IAPs (ORFs 42, 87, 99 and 106) at the
same time points in SF11 oysters (Fig. 6). These data indicate that
SF11 oysters mount a delayed inefficient antiviral response and
have an impacted apoptosis regulation during the late phase
response.
OsHV-1 infection alters the antibacterial defence of oysters.
Histological sections of SF11 oysters showed accumulation of
OsHV-1 in the haemocytes (Fig. 7), which are oyster immune
cells that play a major role in controlling bacterial infections33.
Interestingly, histological sections of RF21 oysters were devoid of
OsHV-1 positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 11). As a proxy to
monitor the antibacterial defence of oysters, we analysed the
expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in
both oyster families. AMPs showed highly contrasted expression
patterns in RF21 and SF11 oysters during the experiment (Fig. 8).
In resistant (RF21) oysters, expression of Cg-BigDef1 and 2 was
induced. Conversely, expression of Cg-BigDef1, Cg-BigDef3 and
Cg-PRP transcripts decreased significantly and regularly over
time in SF11 oysters (Kruskal–Wallis, p = 0.009, 0.009, and 0.005,
respectively). This overall repression of AMP expression, which
has not been previously reported, was particularly strong after
24 h, which corresponds to the period of microbiota destabiliza-
tion preceding bacterial proliferation in SF11 oysters (Figs. 2, 3
and 4). Interestingly, both Cg-BigDefs and Cg-PRPs are produced
only by haemocytes34. We also showed that the transcript
abundance of Cg-EcSOD, a specific marker of haemocytes35,
decreased over time in SF11 oysters only (Fig. 8). Taken together,
our data strongly suggest that by invading haemocytes of sus-
ceptible oysters, OsHV-1 infection alters haemocyte functions
and thereby disrupts an important component of the oyster
antibacterial shield.
Similar events lead to similar phenotypes across families. To
determine whether the main molecular events observed in SF11
and RF21 oysters were conserved in other oyster families sharing
the same phenotypes but with distinct genetic backgrounds,
we monitored viral replication, bacterial load and gene expression
in two additional susceptible families, SF14 and SF15, which died
at more than 96% (Fig. 1), and in two other resistant families
(RF23 and RF48), which died at less than 18% (Fig. 1). Consistent
with our previous observations for RF11 and SF21, viral infection
occurred early (12 h) after the beginning of the experimental
infection in all oyster families, but OsHV-1 replicated intensely in
susceptible families (SF14 and SF15) only (Fig. 9a). Subsequently,
these two families were heavily colonized by bacteria (pairwise
t-test at T72h; d.f. = 10; p = 0.0027), including vibrios and
V. crassostreae (Fig. 9b-d). Like SF11, the susceptible families SF14
and SF15 exhibited a high induction of both oyster and viral
IAP (pairwise t-test at T72h; d.f. = 10; p = 0.0025 and p < 0.0001,
respectively), together with lower expression or repression of
haemocyte genes encoding AMPs and Cg-EcSOD (Fig. 9e, f). In
contrast, oysters from resistant families RF23 and RF48 displayed
neither such a massive induction of IAP nor a repression of

Fig. 6 Viral and oyster endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are strongly induced in the susceptible SF11 oysters (but not in the resistant RF21 oysters)
during the ‘natural’ experimental infection. The fold changes in virus IAPs, oyster IAPs, and oyster and baculoviral IAPs were calculated between each time
point of the kinetics and the T0. Analyses were conducted with the RNA-seq data through mapping against the C. gigas genome for oyster IAPs and against
the OsHV-1 genome for viral IAPs30. The intensity of the colour indicates the magnitude of the differential expression (log2 fold change). The heatmap was

 Cg-EcSOD or AMP expression, which were instead induced
(Fig. 9e, f), confirming earlier results for the RF21 family (Figs. 6
and 8). Finally, we showed that early induction of antiviral genes
(Viperin, cGAS, IRF, TNF and SOCS2) at 6 h (pairwise t-test; d.f.
= 10; p = 0.1841, p = 0.0063, p = 0.0317, p = 0.0024, p = 0.0409,
respectively) and 12 h (pairwise t-test; d.f. = 10; p = 0.0012,
p = 0.0011, p = 0.0143, p = 0.0009, p < 0.0001, respectively) was
the hallmark of resistant families (Fig. 9g), as also evidenced
by the RNA-seq data from RF21 oysters (Supplementary Data 3).
Viral infection and bacteraemia are needed to kill oysters. To
disentangle the respective roles of OsHV-1 and bacteria in
pathogenesis, we designed a series of experimental infections
using genetically diversified juveniles (Fig. 10). In a first set of
experiments, we mimicked the simultaneous transmission of
OsHV-1 and vibrios from infected to healthy oysters. Recipient
(healthy) oysters were simultaneously exposed to two types of
donors: the first ones were injected with V. crassostreae (patho-
genic strain J2-921), and the second ones were injected with
OsHV-1 (Fig. 10a–j). The mortality of the donors is presented in
Supplementary Fig. 12. Recipient oysters were either injected with
poly(I:C), which restricts OsHV-1 replication36, with sterile sea-
water (SW) as a control (Fig. 10a–e), or treated with chlor-
amphenicol, a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic that is
used to limit oyster colonization by bacteria, particularly vibrios12
(Fig. 10f–j). The mortality and pathogen load of recipient oysters
were monitored throughout disease development. Injection of
poly(I:C), as opposed to SW, was sufficient to completely block
OsHV-1 replication (Fig. 10b), bacterial colonization (Fig. 10c, d
and e) and the death of recipient oysters (Fig. 10a). Moreover,
antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the load of vibrios
(pairwise t-test at T72h; d.f. = 2; p = 0.0009, Fig. 10i) including V.
crassostreae (pairwise t-test at T72h; d.f. = 2; p = 0.028, Fig. 10j)
and oyster mortality (Mantel–Cox log-rank test, p = 0.0075,
Fig. 10f) without affecting OsHV-1 replication (Fig. 10g) and the
total bacterial load associated with oysters (Fig. 10h). Importantly,
when we mimicked the transmission of only one pathogen
(Fig. 10k–o), the mortality of recipient oysters was observed only
when they were exposed to virus-injected donors (Fig. 10k).
In this condition, viral replication (Fig. 10l) was accompanied
by increases in the total bacterial (Fig. 10m) and total vibrio
loads (Fig. 10n). Nevertheless, V. crassostreae, which was not
included in this last experimental infection set-up, was not
detected in oyster flesh (Fig. 10o). Two additional rationalized
experimental infections were performed using the same design
with susceptible juveniles from a biparental family (family H1210)
(Supplementary Fig. 13). Both experiments confirmed the

included OTUs from different genera, which increased signifi-
cantly in the four treatments in which mortalities occurred
(Supplementary Fig. 15b, c, d and e). Two of them (Vibrio and
Arcobacter) were common to three out of four treatments
(Supplementary Fig. 15b, c and e). These two genera were also
found to colonize the recipient oysters in our initial ‘natural’
experimental infection (Fig. 3b). Finally, although chloramphe-
nicol treatment reduced and delayed mortality (Fig. 10b),
secondary bacterial infection could still occur involving bacteria
from other genera (Supplementary Fig. 15d). Taken together,
these results indicate that viral infection is necessary to initiate
the infectious process and that opportunistic bacteria are
responsible for a secondary infection necessary to complete
disease development.

 incompletely understood until now. The entire sequence of events
leading to oyster death was traced and identified.
We showed that infection by the OsHV-1 µVar is the first
event that occurs during the infectious process and that the
intense replication of this virus is a prerequisite for development
of the disease. We showed that the immune cells of oysters, the
haemocytes, are one of the cell types targeted by the virus. This
localization of OsHV-1 in haemocytes during the infectious
process has also been recently reported37. Notably, infection of
haemocytes by OsHV-1 impacted haemocyte physiology and
particularly impaired the expression of AMPs either through
transcriptional regulation or indirectly through the induction of
cell death or lysis processes, as previously reported37. Following
the repression of antibacterial defences, profound changes in
oyster-associated microbiota were observed, followed by bacter-
aemia and mortalities. These results clearly identify OsHV-1 as a
necessary actor triggering the disease as a whole.
Bacterial colonization was shown to be the second event
necessary to complete the infectious process leading to death in
oysters. This finding supports previous studies identifying bac-
teria as important aetiological agents of the disease12. From our
histological analysis, gills could be the initial route of bacterial
infection in OsHV-1 immune-compromised oysters before bac-
terial dissemination to the rest of the tissues. Such a scenario is
reminiscent of immune suppression by viruses such as HIV and
secondary colonization by opportunists38. Bacteria of the Vibrio
genus were associated with the disease, supporting previous
studies that identified V. crassostreae as an important pathogenic
population in the field21,22. However, (i) V. crassostreae was
not required to complete the infectious process leading to
oyster death, and (ii) vibrios were not the only bacteria system-
atically associated with dying oysters. Finally, although chlor-
amphenicol treatments controlling vibrios reduced and delayed
mortality, secondary bacterial infection could still occur involving
bacteria from other genera. These results clearly showed that
the secondary bacterial infection of oysters already immune-
compromised by viral infection could be engaged by a series of
opportunistic bacteria present in the environment.
The inability of susceptible oysters to control viral replication
and further bacterial colonization was associated with a strong,
but late, antiviral response. Importantly, the molecular function
negative regulation of cell death was highly mobilized con-
comitantly with the intense replication of the virus in susceptible
oysters. The majority of the genes belonging to this function
encode endogenous IAPs that were strongly induced in suscep-
tible oysters. Remarkably, intense OsHV-1 replication was also
associated with high expression of IAPs of viral origin. Such viral
proteins of the BIR family are known to have anti-apoptotic
activities favouring viral replication39. These results indicate that
both endogenous and exogenous anti-apoptotic processes, which
are strongly activated in susceptible oysters, may play a key role
in the success of OsHV-1 infection26,40.
Oyster resistance was associated with an early limitation of
viral replication during pathogenesis. Although the genomic
determinants of the antiviral response of resistant oysters remain
to be identified and validated functionally, antiviral pathways that
are known to be necessary for resistance to herpesviruses in
vertebrates41 were shown to be highly induced at early times in
resistant oysters only. Genes involved in these pathways could be
valuable candidates for future selective breeding. Overall, our data
indicate that the time required for an oyster to establish effective
immunological control is a key indicator of disease outcome. This
finding is in agreement with theoretical predictions indicating
that variations in parameters such as pathogen expansion or host
response dynamics can affect the outcome of the infection42.
Recent studies in an insect model of bacterial infection also
support this theoretical prediction and identified the early
induction of AMP expression as a key determinant of an efficient
response against infection43.
In conclusion, the present work enabled us to decipher the
mechanisms underlying a complex pathosystem affecting juvenile
oysters. We found that pathogenesis was caused by multiple
infections involving a virus and opportunistic bacteria. Indirect
intra-host interactions were shown to occur during pathogenesis,
enabling bacterial colonization of oysters that were already
immune-compromised by the virus. As in a suprainfection pat-
tern44, we found that the bacteria could not infect oysters in the
absence of the virus, and we never observed oysters infected by
only one of the pathogens. Future studies are needed to validate
this suprainfection model and explore the genetic and physiolo-
gical attributes underlying initial and subsequent colonization
waves in oysters. Characterization of this multifactorial disease
represents a breakthrough that was made possible by holistic
approaches developed by combining ‘natural’ experimental pro-
cedures, using oyster biparental families with contrasted sus-
ceptibilities to the disease and developing thorough molecular
analyses of host responses, the microbiota structure and pathogen
monitoring. This holistic view of diseases as a system provides
an exceptionally well-adapted framework for studying the
factors governing the progression of infections. We believe that
such an integrative and holistic approach could now be applied
to a series of multifactorial diseases that affect non-model
invertebrate species worldwide.
Methods
Production of biparental oyster families. In 2015, fifty different biparental
Crassostrea gigas oyster families were produced from wild seed broodstocks
sampled in farming and non-farming areas in two geographic regions (French
Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, Supplementary Table 1). In the Atlantic area,
73 oysters were collected at Logonna Daoulas (farming area) and 70 oysters at
Dellec (non-farming area). In the Mediterranean area, 125 oysters were collected in
the Thau lagoon (farming area) and 65 at the Vidourle river mouth (non-farming
area). In addition, 84 oysters issued from a mass selection programme to enhance
their resistance to mortality syndrome were used28. All the collected oysters were
transferred to the Ifremer facility at Argenton (Brittany, France) between 6 and
8 January 2015 and treated for 6 days with chloramphenicol (8 mg/l).
For gametogenesis induction, animals were held for 8 weeks in 500 l flow-
through tanks with seawater enriched with a phytoplankton mixture at a constant
temperature of 17 °C13,22. Seawater was UV-treated and filtered through 10-μm
mesh. The daily mixed diet consisted of Tisochrysis lutea (CCAP 927/14; 40 μm3,
12 pg cell−1) and Chaetoceros muelleri (CCAP 1010/3; 80 μm3, 25 pg cell−1). Once
the oysters were reproductively mature, gametes from 91 individuals (46 males,
45 females) were obtained by stripping. Gametes from one male and one female
from the same origin were mixed in a 5-l cylinder at a ratio of 50 spermatozoids per
oocyte (day 0). The fertilized oocytes completed their embryonic development in
5-l tubes filled with 1-μm-filtered, UV-treated seawater at 21 °C for 48 h. The
D-larvae (day 2) were then collected and reared in flow-through rearing systems
at 25 °C45. At the end of the pelagic phase (day 15), all the larvae were collected
on a 100-μm sieve and allowed to settle on cultch. Post-larvae were maintained
in downwelling systems, where they were continuously supplied with enriched
seawater until the experiments began. In the larval and post-larval stages, the
oysters were fed the same diet as the broodstock at a concentration between
1500–2000 μm3 μl−145.
Of the 50 families of oyster seed produced, 3 families from each location were
kept, along with 3 other families from the mass selected broodstock, for ‘natural’
experimental infections. These 15 oyster families were maintained under highly
controlled biosecured conditions to be sure that no oyster pathogens would
interfere with further experiments. The ‘pathogen-free’ status of the animals was
confirmed by (i) the absence of OsHV-1 DNA detection by qPCR and (ii) a low
Vibrio presence (~10 cfu−1 tissue) determined by isolation on selective culture
medium (thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar, TCBS)12. Oysters were observed
to remain free of any abnormal mortality throughout the larvae until the beginning
of the ‘natural’ experimental infections.
‘Natural’ experimental infections. Our experimental infection protocol consists
of a cohabitation between C. gigas oysters (‘donors’) carrying the disease and’pa-
thogen-free’ C. gigas oysters (‘recipients’)13,22. ‘Pathogen-free’ oysters used as
donors (a mixture of 116-day-old oysters from 15 families, 17,700 g with a mean
individual weight of 1.1 g corresponding to a weight of flesh without shell of ~0.2 g)
were first deployed in a farming area (Logonna Daoulas, (lat 48.335263—long

 −4.317922) during the infectious period until the first mortalities occurred (0.01%
on 17 July 2015). Then, donor oysters were transferred back to the laboratory and
placed in contact with ‘pathogen-free’ recipient oysters in a controlled environ-
ment11–13,22 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The experiment was conducted by placing the
same biomass (1120 g) of donors in cohabitation in 15 independent tanks (500 l),
with each containing one of the 15 families (recipient oysters with a mean indi-
vidual weight of 1.1 g corresponding to a weight of flesh without shell of ~0.2 g)
acclimatized in these structures for 2 weeks. In parallel, a control cohabitation
experiment was performed under identical conditions but using donors that had
not spent time in the farming areas. The ‘natural’ experimental infection began on
17 July 2015 and ended on 31 July 2015. Mortality was monitored in laboratory
tanks. When recipients were exposed to the donors (17 July 2015), 2 replicates of
100 ‘pathogen-free’ oysters of each family were placed in the farming area, and
mortality was monitored daily.
During the experimental infection, 10 oysters in triplicate were randomly
sampled without blinding protocols from each tank and at each time (0, 6 h, 12 h,
24 h, 48 h, 60 h and 72 h) of the kinetics. The shell was removed, and pools of 10
oysters were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Oyster pools (10 individuals per pool)
were ground in liquid nitrogen in 50-ml stainless steel bowls with 20-mm-diameter
grinding balls (Retsch MM400 mill). The obtained powders (stored at −80 °C)
were then used for extraction of RNA and DNA. In addition, 5 oysters were
sampled at 54 h and 78 h and fixed in Davidson fixative46 for histological analyses.
Rationalized experimental infections. The experiments were performed using
genetically diversified C. gigas oysters (4 months old with a mean individual whole
weight of 1 g corresponding to a weight of flesh without shell of ~0.2 g) or
susceptible biparental family H1210 C. gigas oysters (4 months old with a mean
individual whole weight 1.5 g corresponding to a weight of flesh without shell of
~0.3 g). Oysters from these genetic backgrounds were ‘pathogen-free’ and were
produced as previously described13. For the experiments, the oysters were
anesthetized in hexahydrate MgCl2 (ACROS, 50 g l−1, 100 oysters l−1) for 2 h47.
Then, they were injected using a 26-gauge needle attached to a multi-dispensing
hand pipette in the adductor muscle to allow spreading into the circulatory system
with either 20 µl viral or 40 µl bacterial inoculum. The OsHV-1 inoculum (3.88 ×
108 OsHV-1 genomic units μl−1) was prepared according to previously described
protocols48, and injections were performed 24 h before the start of the experiment.
Vibrio crassostreae J2-9 was grown under agitation at 20 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB)
+ NaCl 0.5 M for 18 h21. The culture was centrifuged (1000× g, 10 min, 20 °C),
suspended in culture medium to an optical density (OD600) of 1 and injected
(5 × 107 CFU) immediately before the start of the experiment. The rationalized
experimental infections were performed by exposing the recipients (n = 100) to
injected donors (n = 100) in 50-l tanks at 21 °C. A control experiment was carried
out by placing the non-injected donors in contact with recipient oysters. During
each experimental treatment, oysters were sampled at 0 and 72 h, and cumulative
mortality was monitored up to 72 h and 157 h for both donors and recipients,
respectively. Recipient oyster pools were ground in liquid nitrogen in 50-ml
stainless steel bowls with 20-mm-diameter grinding balls (Retsch MM400 mill).
The powders obtained (stored at −80 °C) were then used for DNA extraction. In
one of these rationalized experimental infections, chloramphenicol (8 mg l−1) was
added to the tank every 2 days to restrict bacterial proliferation. In another
experiment, the recipients were treated with poly(I:C), which has been shown to
block OsHV-1 replication36. In this case, 20 µl poly(I:C) (HMW, InvivoGen, cat.
code: tlrl-pic - 1 mg ml−1) was injected into the adductor muscle of recipient
oysters 24 h before the start of the cohabitation experiment. The experiment with
genetically diversified oysters was performed one time. The experiments using
oysters from the H12 family were replicated two times. Three pools of 10 indivi-
duals for each experiment were randomly sampled without blinding protocols, and
submitted for further molecular analysis.
Oyster transcriptome analyses. RNA was extracted from the powdered oysters
using the Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep kit (Proteigene) according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. RNA concentration and purity were checked using a Nanodrop
ND-1000 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), and their integrity was analysed by
capillary electrophoresis on a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent). RNA-seq library con-
struction and sequencing were performed by the Fasteris Company (Switzerland).
Directional cDNA libraries were constructed using a TruSeq mRNA Stranded kit
(Illumina) and sequenced on a Hiseq in paired-end reads of 2 × 75 bp. All data
treatments were carried out under a local galaxy instance49. Phred scores were
checked using the Fastq-X toolkit50 and were higher than 26 over 90% of the read
length for all the sequences. All the reads were thus kept for subsequent analyses.
Mapping to the C. gigas reference genome (assembly version V951) was performed
using RNAstar (Galaxy Version 2.4.0d-252). The HTSeq-count was used to count
the number of reads overlapping annotated genes (mode Union) (Galaxy Version
v0.6.1)53. Finally, the differential gene expression levels were analysed with the
DESeq2 R package54. Fold changes between each time point of the kinetics and the
T0 control condition were considered significant when the adjusted p-value (Padj)
for multiple testing with the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, which controls the
false discovery rate (FDR), was < 0.05.
Because not all known C. gigas AMPs were present in the C. gigas reference
genome (assembly version V951), read counts for all of them were specifically
obtained by alignment against a protein database using DIAMOND 0.7.955. The
AMP database was prepared by retrieving C. gigas sequences from GenBank that
were manually inspected to discard irrelevant or incomplete sequences. The reads
for each sample/replicate were compared with the database using DIAMOND
blastx. Alignments were filtered for the best hit and e‐value < 1e‐6. Read counts for
each AMP were normalized against both the transcript size and the total sequence
number for each sample/replicate and used for the differential gene expression
analysis with DESeq2.
Gene ontology annotation and enrichment analysis. To work with current
functional annotations of the C. gigas gene set, we performed a de novo functional
annotation. Blastx comparison against the NR database was performed for the
28,027 genes annotated in the genome, with a maximum number of target hits of
20 and a minimum e-value of 0.001. XML blast result files were loaded onto
Blast2GO56 for GO mapping and annotation with the b2g_sep13 version of the
B2G database. These results were used as inputs for GO enrichment analysis, which
was performed using adaptive clustering and a rank-based statistical test
(Mann–Whitney U-test combined with adaptive clustering). The R and Perl scripts
used57 can be downloaded [https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU]. The following
parameters were used for adaptive clustering: largest = 0.5; smallest = 10;
clusterCutHeight = 0.25. For the continuous value characterization of each gene in
the data set, we used a strategy aiming to take into account both the level of
expression and the significance of the differential expression. To combine these
two factors, the log2 fold change was attributed to genes that were significantly
differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05), while a zero was attributed to the
others. A category was considered enriched with a FDR < 1%. To represent the
results synthetically, the intensity of the enrichment was calculated with the
following ratios: i) for the upregulated enriched categories, ‘number of genes
significantly upregulated in the category/total number of genes in the category’;
(ii) for the downregulated enriched categories, ‘−1 × (number of genes significantly
downregulated in the category /total number of genes in the category)’. These ratios
were then displayed on a heatmap using the Multiple Experiment Viewer and
clustered according to the Pearson correlation58.
Virus transcriptome analyses. RNA-seq reads that did not align with the C. gigas
genome were collected using SAMtools59. These reads were aligned with the
viral genome sequence of OsHV-1 (Refseq NC_005881.230) using bowtie2 with
single-end global alignment and default parameters60. The abundance of viral
transcripts was calculated using HTSeq-count53 and the viral genome GFF3 file.
The counts for each ORF were normalized by dividing by the size of the ORF and
multiplying by a library normalization factor (calculated as the average library size
for all times and controls divided by the library size for the specific time point).

Quantification of bacteria and viruses. Quantification of OsHV-1, total 16S
rDNA Vibrio and Vibrio crassostreae was performed using quantitative PCR
(qPCR). All amplification reactions were analysed using a Roche LightCycler 480
Real-Time thermocycler (qPHD-Montpellier GenomiX platform, Montpellier
University, France). The total qPCR reaction volume was 1.5 μl and consisted of
0.5 μl DNA (40 ng µl−1) and 1 μl LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix
(Roche) containing 0.5 μM PCR primer (Eurogenetec SA). Virus-specific primer
pairs targeted a region of the OsHV-1 genome predicted to encode a DNA poly-
merase catalytic subunit (ORF100, AY509253): Fw-ATTGATGATGTGGATAAT
CTGTG and Rev-GGTAAATACCATTGGTCTTGTTCC30. Total bacteria specific
primer pairs were the 341F-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and 805R-GACTACHV
GGGTATCTAATCC primers targeting the variable V3V4 loops for bacterial
communities61. Total Vibrio specific primer pairs were Fw-GGCGTAAAGCGCA
TGCAGGT and Rev-GAAATTCTACCCCCCTCTACAG62, and Vibrio crassos-
treae-specific primer pairs were Fw-ATGACCATCCAACAACCCG and Rev-AGC
CGTAATTGATACGCACG. A Labcyte Acoustic Automated Liquid Handling
Platform (ECHO) was used for pipetting into the 384-well plate (Roche). A
LightCycler® 480 Instrument (Roche) was used for qPCR with the following
program: enzyme activation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of dena-
turation (95 °C, 10 s), hybridization (60 °C, 20 s) and elongation (72 °C, 25 s). A
subsequent melting temperature curve of the amplicon was performed to verify the
specificity of the amplification. Absolute quantification of viral and bacterial DNA
copies were estimated by comparing the observed Cq values to a standard curve of
the DP amplification product cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector for OsHV-1 and
from total DNA extraction of V. crassostreae J2-9 for total vibrio 16S rDNA. For
total bacteria and V. crassostreae 16S rDNA, we used the relative quantification
calculated by the 2−ΔΔCq method63 with the mean of the measured threshold
cycle values of two reference genes (Cg-BPI, GenBank: AY165040 and Cg-actin,
GenBank: AF026063).
Giemsa staining and in situ hybridization. Crassostrea gigas tissues were fixed for
24 h in Davidson fixative46. Tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, serially sec-
tioned to a thickness of 5 μm and collected on polylysine-coated slides (performed

 by Histalim Company, France). To visualize bacteria that had infiltrated the
tissues, tissue sections were stained using Giemsa, which coloured the different
tissues and cells in shades of pink to purple and most bacteria in deep blue
(performed by Histalim Company, France). The presence of OsHV-1 in tissue
sections was detected by in situ hybridization following a previously published
protocol64. The slides were hybridized with 5 ng µl−1 of OsHV-1-specific
digoxigenin-labelled (DIG) antisense probes designed based on the C2-C6 frag-
ment of the ORF4 of the OsHV-1 reference genome (GenBank: NC_005881.2),
which is also present in the OsHV-1 µVar sequence. As a negative control, for the
specificity assessment of the OsHV-1 probe, the samples were also hybridized with
a GFP probe with no homology to the OsHV-1 or C. gigas genomes. The primers
used for the probe synthesis were as follows: OsHV-1 probe, C2-
CTCTTTACCATGAAGATACCCACC and C6-GTGCACGGCTTACCATTTTT;
GFP probe, GFP-Fw-ACGTAAACGGCCACAAGTTC and GFP-Rev-AAGTCGT
GCTGCTTCATGTG. After hybridization, the tissues were counter-stained with
a solution of Bismark Brown yellow. Haemocyte localization in tissue sections
was performed by immunohistology. After dewaxing the tissue sections in xylene
followed by rehydration in an ethanol series and distilled water, a heat-induced
antigen retrieval procedure was conducted by incubating the sections for 12 min in
sodium citrate solution (10 mM, pH 6) in a microwave (800 W). The sections were
then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in a 5% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) and
0.1% Triton X100 solution as a blocking agent and permeabilization solution.
Immunodetection of the haemocyte-specific protein Cg-EcSOD was performed
using a primary antibody produced in-house from mouse ascites35. Sections were
incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 °C in a 1/500 dilution (in PBS-
5% NFDM) of the primary antibody and rinsed 3 × 5 min in TBS (pH 7.4). A 1/
5000 dilution of the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse polyvalent immu-
noglobulin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, SIGMA A0162) was then applied for
2 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber, and the sections were rinsed
2×5 min in TBS. Alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity was revealed by incu-
bating slides in NBT/BCIP solution for 20 min in the dark, and reactions were
stopped by thoroughly rinsing the slides in distilled water. As a negative control for
specificity assessment of the anti-Cg-EcSOD signal, the sections were incubated
with the secondary antibody only. The slides were finally mounted in Dako
mounting medium (DAKO S3023). Images were acquired using a Zeiss microscope
equipped with a Zeiss colour camera and managed with ZEN software (Montpellier
RIO imaging platform). For in situ hybridization, labelling was observed only
with the virus-specific probe, and no labelling was detected in the sections treated
with the GFP probe (Supplementary Fig. 16). For Cg-EcSOD immunostaining,
labelling was observed in sections treated with anti-Cg-EcSOD antibody, and
no labelling was observed for slides treated with the secondary antibody only
(Supplementary Fig. 17).
RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis. RNA extraction was performed
using Direct-zoltm RNA MiniPrep according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Zymo Research). Frozen oyster powder (20 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml
TRIzol by vortexing 1 h at 4 °C. Prior to extraction, insoluble materials were
removed by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. The quantification
and integrity of the total RNA were checked using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific) and 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. Total
RNA (300 ng) was reverse-transcribed in 20 μl using Moloney Murine Leukaemia
Virus Reverse Transcriptase (MMLV-RT) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen). Amplification and pipetting were performed with a
Roche LightCycler 480 and a Labcyte Acoustic Automated Liquid Handling
Platform (ECHO), as previously described (see above, Quantification of
bacteria and viruses). The total RT-qPCR reaction volume was 1.5 μl and consisted
of 0.5 μl of cDNA (dilution 1/6) and 1 μl of LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master
mix (Roche) containing 0.5 μM of PCR primer (Eurogenetec SA). The amplifica-
tion efficiency of each primer pair (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) was validated by
serial dilution of a pool of all cDNAs. Related expression was calculated as the
threshold cycle (Cq) values of selected genes minus the mean of the measured
threshold cycle (Cq) values of three constitutively expressed genes (Cg-EF1,
Cg-RPL40 and Cg-RPS6).
Bacterial microbiota analysis. DNA from powdered oyster tissues was extracted
with DNA from the tissue Macherey-Nagel kit (reference 740952.250) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Prior to 90 min of enzymatic lysis in the presence of
proteinase K, an additional 12-min mechanical lysis (Retsch MM400 mill) was
performed with zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec). DNA concentration and purity
were checked with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). For
each sample, 16S rDNA amplicon libraries were generated using the 341F-
CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and 805R-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC pri-
mers targeting the variable V3V4 loops for bacterial communities61. Paired-end
sequencing with a 250-bp read length was performed at McGill University (Gén-
ome Québec Innovation Centre, Montréal, Canada) on a MiSeq system (Illumina)
using v2 chemistry according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The FROGS pipeline
(Find Rapidly OTU with Galaxy Solution) implemented on a galaxy instance
[http://sigenae-workbench.toulouse.inra.fr/galaxy/] was used for data processing65.
In brief, paired reads were merged using FLASH66. After denoising and primer/
adapter removal with cutadapt67, clustering was performed using SWARM, which
uses a novel clustering algorithm with a threshold (distance = 3) corresponding to
the maximum number of differences between two OTUs68. Chimeras were
removed using VSEARCH69. We filtered out the data set for singletons and
performed an affiliation using Blast + against the Silva 16S rDNA database
(release 128, Sept 2016) to produce an OTU and affiliation table in the standard
BIOM format. Rarefaction curves of species richness were produced using the
R package and the rarefy_even_depth and ggrare functions70. We used phyloseq to
obtain relative abundances at different taxonomic ranks (from genus to phylum)
(tax_glom function). In our analyses, we only kept taxa that had a true annotation
for each corresponding taxonomic rank (from genus to phylum).
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using R v3.3.1 (R: a
language and environment for statistical computing, 2008; R Development Core
Team, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria [http://www.R-
project.org]). Survival curves were used to analyse mortality kinetics, and the non-
parametric Kaplan–Meier test was used to estimate log-rank values for comparing
conditions. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA, {phyloseq}) were computed to
represent dissimilarities between samples using the Bray–Curtis distance matrix
(ordinate, {phyloseq}). Multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions was tested
between bacterial assemblages of SF11 and RF21 using 999 permutations (permutest,
betadisper, {vegan}). To identify candidate taxa with changes in abundances
between the initial and the final time points of the experiment, we used DESeq2
(DESeq54) from the OTUs to the higher taxonomic ranks. Heatmaps of significant
genera were computed using relative abundances and the heatmap.2 function
({gplots}). We performed one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis
tests when the normality of residuals was rejected (Shapiro test) to compare alpha
diversity metrics for bacterial microbiota, along with OsHV-1 (RNA and DNA
level) and bacterial absolute abundances over the experiment after logarithmic
transformations. When the ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis tests were significant, we
then computed pairwise comparisons between group levels (post-hoc analyses)
with Bonferroni corrections for multiple testing using the pairwise t-test and the
Dunn test, respectively. For all analyses, the threshold significance level was set
at 0.05.
