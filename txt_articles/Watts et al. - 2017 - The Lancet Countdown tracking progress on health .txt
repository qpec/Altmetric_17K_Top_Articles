The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change is an international, multidisciplinary research 
collaboration between academic institutions and practitioners across the world. It follows on from the work of the 
2015 Lancet Commission, which concluded that the response to climate change could be “the greatest global health 
opportunity of the 21st century”. The Lancet Countdown aims to track the health impacts of climate hazards; health 
resilience and adaptation; health co-benefi
 ts of climate change mitigation; economics and fi
 nance; and political and 
broader engagement. These focus areas form the fi
 ve thematic working groups of the Lancet Countdown and 
represent diff
 erent aspects of the complex association between health and climate change. These thematic groups will 
provide indicators for a global overview of health and climate change; national case studies highlighting countries 
leading the way or going against the trend; and engagement with a range of stakeholders. The Lancet Countdown 
ultimately aims to report annually on a series of indicators across these fi
 ve working groups. This paper outlines the 
potential indicators and indicator domains to be tracked by the collaboration, with suggestions on the methodologies 
and datasets available to achieve this end. The proposed indicator domains require further refi
 nement, and mark the 
beginning of an ongoing consultation process—from November, 2016 to early 2017—to develop these domains, 
identify key areas not currently covered, and change indicators where necessary. This collaboration will actively seek 
to engage with existing monitoring processes, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO’s climate 
and health country profi
 les. The indicators will also evolve over time through ongoing collaboration with experts and 
a range of stakeholders, and be dependent on the emergence of new evidence and knowledge. During the course of 
its work, the Lancet Countdown will adopt a collaborative and iterative process, which aims to complement existing 
initiatives, welcome engagement with new partners, and be open to developing new research projects on health and 
climate change.
Introduction
WHO estimated that, in 2012, 12·6 million deaths 
(23% of all deaths worldwide) were attributable to 
modifi
 able environmental factors, many of which could 
be infl
 uenced by climate change or are related to the 
driving forces of climate change.1 The 2009 UCL–Lancet 
Commission: managing the health eff
 ects of climate change2 
described the ways in which climate change acts as a 
force multiplier for threats to global health. This initiative 
has drawn on long-standing expertise and leadership in 
the health and climate fi
 eld, including from institutions 
such as WHO and the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC), and a previous call for the 
systematic monitoring of health outcomes related to 
climate change.3,4
The 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate 
Change: policy responses to protect public health5 built on 
these foundations and explored the health benefi
 ts of 
climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. As 
fi
 rst described in the 2009 Lancet series, greenhouse gas 
mitigation across a range of sectors can result in 
considerable improvements in public health.6–10 Taken 
together, the potential to avoid substantial impacts of 
climate change and the potential co-benefi
 ts of climate 
change mitigation and adaptation led the 2015 Lancet 
Commission5 to conclude that “tackling climate change 
could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 
21st century”.
The direct impacts of climate change result from rising 
temperatures, heatwaves, and increases in the frequency 
of complex extreme weather events such as windstorms, 
fl
 oods, 
and 
droughts.11 
The 
health 
and 
social 
consequences of these events are far-reaching, ranging 
from reduced labour productivity and heat-related 
deaths, through to direct injury, the spread of infectious 
diseases, and mental health eff
 ects following widespread 
fl
 ooding. The eff
 ects of climate change will also be 
heterogeneously mediated across diff
 erent environmental 
and social systems, resulting in changing patterns of the 
burden and distribution of infectious diseases, changes 
in food productivity, and potential eff
 ects on food and 
water shortages, population displacement, and confl
 ict 
(fi
 gure 1).3 Climate change places undue burden on the 
countries least responsible and least able to respond, 
with 
low-income 
and 
middle-income 
countries 
experiencing multiple impacts simultaneously.12
The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on 
planetary health13 described how sustained human health 
and development are dependent on fl
 ourishing natural 
systems. This Commission13 and others14 have drawn

attention to the fact that human activities are breaching 
environmental limits across a range of areas, driving 
terrestrial and marine biodiversity loss, ocean acidifi
 cation, 
depletion of freshwater, soil degradation, and other 
potentially irreversible processes.
At the international level, the Paris Agreement provides 
the framework for future international cooperation and 
national action on climate change. Modelling suggests 
that the full implementation of all mitigation actions 
pledged by national governments would limit average 
global warming to around 2·7oC by 2100—an improvement 
on the high-end 4·8oC or more scenario, but substantially 
higher than the agreed UN target of “well below 2·0oC”.15
Responsibility for implementation of the Paris 
Agreement now falls on national governments. The next 
15 years, from 2016 to 2030, are a crucial window that will 
determine the trajectory of climate change and human 
development for the coming century. As part of this 
transition, countries will have to undergo a shift from 
understanding climate change solely as a threat, 
to embracing the response to climate change as an 
opportunity for human health and wellbeing. Tracking 
and communicating this transition will be the central 
focus of the Lancet Countdown.
Aims of the Lancet Countdown on health and 
climate change
The Lancet Countdown aims to track the impacts of 
climate change and the speed of the transition to a 
decarbonised global economy (a transition that is already 
underway); analyse and show the health benefi
 ts 
available; provide a global picture of successes and 
obstructions in this shift; draw out exemplary case 
studies for shared learning; and engage with policy 
makers and the broader health community to better 
communicate the opportunities available in responding 
to climate change both for health and more broadly.
To do this, the Lancet Countdown will report annually 
on key indicators that refl
 ect progress on health and 
climate change. Published each year, before the 
international negotiations of the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the annual 
Lancet paper will consider global and selective national, 
regional, and city-level trends. Five interrelated thematic 
working groups will cover diff
 erent aspects of the 
association between health and climate change, including 
the health eff
 ects of climate change; health resilience and 
adaptation; the health co-benefi
 ts of climate change 
mitigation; fi
 nance and economics; and political and 
broader engagement.
The Lancet Countdown is an international, multi 
disciplinary research collaboration between academic 
institutions and experts across the world. Although the 
2015 Lancet Commission existed as a partnership primarily 
between 
European 
and 
Chinese 
academics, 
the 
Lancet Countdown will build on these foundations to be 
more global in both expertise and outlook.
Indicators of progress: a call for input and 
engagement
The work of the Lancet Countdown is divided into fi
 ve 
working groups, responsible for specifi
 c sets of indicators 
and their integration. Proposed indicator domains for 
these working groups are outlined in the panel and 
below. These indicators and indicator domains are 
presented for consultation with varying degrees of 
certainty, ranging from the presentation of a specifi
 c 
indicator through to the description of a broad domain 
within which several indicators might be present.
The ongoing framing and selection of indicators to 
mark the progress to a low-carbon and climate-resilient 
society could take various forms, such as focusing on the 
interactions between society and the environment (as 
seen in the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Exposure-
Eff
 ect-Action 
[DPSEEA] 
framework, 
adapted 
in 
appendix 1), or the vulnerability, risk, and adaptive 
capacity to climate change.16–18 The selected indicators will 
need to address the challenges of representing and 
summarising spatial and temporal factors in a concise 
way. The framing used to select indicators as part of the 
Lancet Countdown is primarily from the health 
perspective. In turn, the focus is on those indicators that 
capture the greatest eff
 ects that climate change has on 
health; the anthropogenic drivers that have the greatest 
contribution to climate change, and the measures and 
actions that would substantially reduce the eff
 ects of 
climate change or yield health co-benefi
 ts of climate 
change mitigation policies.
The proposed indicators and indicator domains refl
 ect 
a pragmatic need to capture progress in the key 
interactions between health and climate change with the 
best available data that is meaningful to the health 
community and more widely. These indicators and 
indicator domains were developed through an iterative 
process, following an initial, broad consultation process, 
which involved input from a variety of experts in the 
fi
 eld. They were further discussed and refi
 ned by the 
Lancet Countdown’s academic working groups at a series 
of multidisciplinary meetings throughout 2016. Each 
proposed indicator domain was assessed for its ability to 
address a unique aspect of the association between 
health and climate change; potential data availability; 
feasibility 
given 
current 
resource 
constraints; 
applicability to countries across a variety of resource 
settings; and policy relevance.
This collaborative process is intended to complement 
other monitoring initiatives, such as the information 
being collected under the WHO climate and health 
country 
profi
 les, 
the 
Sustainable 
Healthy 
Urban 
Environments (SHUE) project, the Sendai Framework, 
and the ClimateWorks Foundation’s Carbon Transparency 
Initiative.19–22 The work of the Lancet Countdown will also 
draw on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
where appropriate. The potential links between these 
initiatives and the Lancet Countdown’s indicator domains

have been summarised in appendix 2. Where relevant 
crossover exists, the Lancet Countdown will build upon 
and incorporate these data into its work to ensure its 
overview is more complete and standardised. 
This paper marks the beginning of an external 
consultation process to further refi
 ne the suggestions 
below. Indeed, it is expected that the indicators and 
metrics used will continuously evolve to make use of 
emerging evidence and data availability. To this end, the 
Lancet Countdown is committed to maintaining an open 
approach towards further developing its work programme, 
inviting external input, and actively consulting over the 
coming months. This research collaboration welcomes 
engagement with new academic partners, with the 
expertise and capacity to make substantial contributions 
to the fi
 nal indicator process. The collaboration is also 
open to developing new research projects on as-yet 
neglected areas of health and climate change, with the 
possibility of jointly seeking additional funding and 
capacity for this work in future. We invite direct input on 
the content, methods, and data for the proposed indicators 
and indicator domains, as well as proposals for new 
partnerships, on the Lancet Countdown website.
1: Health impacts of climate hazards 
The health eff
 ects of climate change are projected to 
become increasingly severe in the future, and threaten 
to undermine the gains made in public health and 
development during the past half-century.3,5 The eff
 ects 
of climate change are unevenly distributed within and 
between countries, with all risks having important 
social, economic, and geographical mediating factors.19 
The fi
 rst working group of the Lancet Countdown 
proposes seven indicator domains to be considered and 
then tracked.
1.1–1.5: Human exposure to extreme weather
The fi
 rst indicators and indicator domains in this working 
group will use observed meteorological data to track 
exposure to extremes of weather across fi
 ve areas: annual 
mean temperature change, heatwaves, heat index relevant 
for outdoor labour productivity, fl
 ood risk, and drought. 
These data will be complemented by a review of the 
detection and attribution studies linking climate change 
to specifi
 c extreme weather events that have aff
 ected 
human health. For consistency and transparency, these 
indices are deliberately similar to those presented in the

2015 Lancet Commission5. For the Lancet Countdown, we 
will focus on metrics calculated from observational data 
rather than climate model projections. However, we will 
aim to maintain comparability between these metrics for 
monitoring progress and the exposure metrics implied by 
the future projections presented in the Lancet Commission 
report.5
Increases in mean temperature and changes in the 
severity and frequency of heatwaves bring about substantial 
and potentially fatal health risks to most populations.3,23 
These include vulnerable individuals with higher outdoor 
exposure (ie, those engaged in outdoor physical labour), 
and individuals with reduced capacity to maintain 
physiological homeostasis, such as infi
 rm individuals, 
neonates, or older people. The direct association between 
extremes of heat and heat-related morbidity and mortality 
is well established; a similar—although comparatively less 
clear—association exists between indicators of thermal 
stress, such as wet bulb globe temperature, and reductions 
in outdoor labour productivity.24 Examples of direct and 
indirect health eff
 ects were seen in the 2010 heatwave in 
Russia, which resulted in approximately 11 000 excess 
deaths arising from heat and poor air quality from 
subsequent forest fi
 res.25 The Lancet Countdown will 
utilise the population-related metrics developed from the 
2015 Lancet Commission5 to calculate the mean increase in 
temperature experienced by people. The Lancet Countdown 
will also make use of the index proposed by Jacob and 
colleagues,26 defi
 ning a heatwave as more than three 
consecutive days in which the minimum temperature 
exceeds the 99th percentile relative to summers in the 
recent past (the ‘recent past’ is defi
 ned as 1986 to 2005, for 
consistency with the 2015 Lancet Commission). In 
addition, changes in labour productivity will be modelled 
with the use of wet bulb globe temperature, which has 
been used to identify thresholds of heat stress.27
The fourth indicator domain will follow human exposure 
to fl
 ood, and the fi
 fth indicator domain will look at human 
exposure to drought. In this context, fl
 ood refers to 
meteorological fl
 oods related to rain and storm surges, 
rather than fl
 oods caused by rising sea levels, tsunamis, 
volcanic eruptions, and melting snow and ice. Drought 
refers 
to 
meteorological 
drought—a 
defi
 cit 
of 
precipitation—rather than other forms of drought, such as 
water depletion caused by increasing demand.28,29 
Observational data suggest that many regions with a rising 
frequency of meteorological drought over the past 60 years 
overlap with crucial agricultural zones and regions where 
rapid population growth is expected—in particular, in 
sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.30,31 The analyses in the 
2015 Lancet Commission5 projected an additional 1·4 billion 
person drought exposure events per year by 2100, as a 
result of population growth and climate change.
The eff
 ect that climate change will have on mental 
health and wellbeing is an issue of particular importance, 
and is often amplifi
 ed in low-resource settings with 
inadequate protective social and public health institutions. 
The Lancet Countdown is currently exploring options to 
track the mental health eff
 ects of climate change.

many infectious diseases are directly or indirectly 
infl
 uenced by climate.32 The distribution and impacts of 
infectious diseases are already being altered by the 
various dimensions of climate change observed so far, 
and are projected to worsen for many infectious diseases 
in the future.33–35
Given the existing information about climate-sensitive 
infectious diseases, we will fi
 rst derive a shortlist of 
relevant diseases or disease groups to road-test the 
indicator and then expand the list to include other 
relevant infectious diseases, following wider input 
from—and 
consultation 
with—infectious 
disease 
experts. Examples from three key groups will be tracked: 
food-borne diseases, vector-borne diseases, and parasitic 
diseases or zoonotic diseases.36 Each of these groups, and 
specifi
 c diseases within each group, are likely to be 
aff
 ected by climate change in diverse ways. Our aim is to 
place a fi
 nger on the pulse of these impacts at a global 
scale and facilitate trend tracking through time. The sixth 
indicator domain will thus leverage surveillance and 
research networks that monitor and synthesise existing 
data to model changes in infectious disease impacts, 
risks, and exposure that are relevant to climate change.37–39 
This process will identify sentinel sites (as comprehensive 
monitoring is not feasible) across a range of geographical 
regions.4 We would welcome suggestions of suitable sites 
and diseases.
Several sub-indicators will be derived for this purpose, 
broadly covering the following areas: infectious disease 
outbreaks; the occurrence and spread of infectious 
diseases, causative agents, and vector or reservoir species; 
and the prevalence and incidence of infectious diseases. 
These sub-indicators will provide a picture of changing 
trends in exposure to, and impacts from, infectious 
diseases caused by climate change. Four focal metrics are 
proposed for each of these indicators: (1) changes in 
observed and predicted cases in the human population; 
(2) observed or predicted changes in a geographical or 
temporal context; (3) observed or predicted changes in 
environmental suitability for sentinel pathogens, vectors, 
or reservoirs; and (4) changes in other environmental 
exposures and confounding factors.
1.7: Food security and undernutrition
Reliable access to suffi
  cient, aff
 ordable, and nutritious 
food can be negatively aff
 ected by climate change in 
many ways. This ranges from the direct impact of 
drought, fl
 ood, and heat on harvest yields, through to the 
health and social impacts of climate change, resulting in 
unhealthy populations unable to farm or work enough to 
earn money to purchase food. Furthermore, food trade 
could be disrupted as a result of damage to infrastructure 
caused by climate shocks.40 Populations in low-income 
countries reliant on rain-fed agriculture are often 
particularly vulnerable to climate change and weather 
shocks. These changes disproportionately aff
 ect the 
availability and cost of staple foods, as access to 
international markets is unreliable and low food stocks 
are unable to buff
 er price spikes.40
Although the health implications of food insecurity are 
local, international and national drivers are also 
important.41 Furthermore, measures to ensure climate-
resilient food systems improve food security, public 
health, and community development.40 Climate-related 
indicators of food security can address direct availability 
of food (agricultural production), ability of households to 
purchase food (household poverty relative to food prices), 
and resilience to shocks (food stocks and international 
trade in grains). The seventh proposed indicator domain 
will therefore focus on food price indices and food stocks 
as a proxy for food aff
 ordability and availability. Other 
environmental and socioeconomic factors are likely to be 
key to understanding food security and undernutrition. 
To this end, the Lancet Countdown will seek partnership 
with external initiatives to fully address this interaction.
2: Health resilience and adaptation
Adaptation interventions designed to minimise the health 
impacts of climate change are already required. The 
second working group of the Lancet Countdown will 
therefore focus on the design and deployment of 
adaptation and resilience interventions. It will particularly 
draw on data collected for the WHO climate and health 
country profi
 les, including responses to surveys from 
national ministries of health.19 
2.1: Integration of health into national adaptation plans
Past and ongoing human infl
 uence on the atmosphere 
and ecosystem means we are now committed to climate 
change for centuries to come. Health and related 
systems, such as water, sanitation, and nutrition, will 
need to become more resilient and adaptable to changing 
climate conditions, to continue to protect and promote 
health in a changing climate. WHO, UNFCCC and other 
international agencies are supporting countries to 
develop the health components of national adaptation 
plans, and promoting a comprehensive approach to build 
resilience into the building blocks of health and other 
relevant systems.42,43 This proposed indicator will use the 
monitoring 
systems 
established 
for 
the 
SDG 
indicator 13.2.1, monitoring submissions to the 
UNFCCC, and survey responses from national ministries 
of health, to track the number of countries that have 
developed a health adaptation plan, the range of functions 
covered, and the extent of implementation.
2.2: Climate services for health
Informed adaptation and sustainable development 
requires the use of climate information for evidence-
based decision making in the health sector. This 
endeavour depends fundamentally on the availability of 
relevant, 
high-quality 
climate 
and 
environmental 
observations, as well as the institutional and human 
capacity to transform climate data into reliable and 
 Review
6 
www.thelancet.com   Published online November 14, 2016   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32124-9
relevant climate products and services. The availability of, 
access to, and use of climate services are thus a 
cornerstone for health adaptation. These services should 
therefore be monitored as an indicator of the capacity of 
the health sector to help anticipate and prepare for climate 
risks, appropriately target long-term and short-term 
investments, and avoid potentially maladaptive choices.
For the purposes of the Lancet Countdown, we plan to 
collaborate with the World Meteorological Organization 
to conduct a periodic survey of national hydrological and 
meteorological services, to monitor the demand, 
availability, and provision of climate information services 
provided to the public and national health authorities. 
Categories of services surveyed could include sharing of 
historical climate and hydrological observations, tailored 
forecasts or monitoring exposure to hazardous air quality, 
pollen, extreme heat, fl
 oods, and storms; or provision of 
tailored climate scenarios and impact projections. This 
information will also be cross-referenced with WHO 
surveys of national ministries of health to measure the 
extent to which countries use this information to inform 
health surveillance and to develop early warning and 
response systems. An additional dimension to this 
indicator domain could involve analyses of national 
expenditure on climate information services.
2.3: Adaptation of fi
 nance for health
Health is widely recognised as a priority for adaptation. 
For example, over 95% of the least developed countries 
identifi
 ed health as a priority in their UNFCCC National 
Adaptation Programmes for Action.44 However, this 
priority is not yet refl
 ected in fi
 nancial fl
 ows, with less 
than 1·5% of international climate fi
 nance for adaptation 
directed to projects specifi
 cally addressing health.19 This 
proposed indicator domain will thus use information 
from monitoring systems of multilateral and bilateral 
climate fi
 nance, including SDG indicator 13.a.1, as well 
as survey responses from health ministries, to measure 
the level of investment of international and domestic 
resources towards health adaptation to climate change.
3: Health co-benefi
 ts of climate change 
mitigation
The existence of ancillary health benefi
 ts (co-benefi
 ts) of 
climate change mitigation policies provides a powerful 
incentive to accelerate policy change, as these benefi
 ts 
are experienced in the near term, whereas the benefi
 ts of 
climate change mitigation are largely observed in the 
long term. As noted, however, such benefi
 ts are not 
automatic, and care is needed to avoid unintended 
adverse consequences for health. To assess progress in 
climate change mitigation and the potential resultant 
ancillary health eff
 ects (mainly co-benefi
 ts), the third 
working group envisions tracking nine indicators across 
four systems—energy, transport, food, and health care.
Here, relevant categories of data include trends in 
greenhouse gas emissions and short-lived climate 
pollutant emissions, indicators relevant to the pathways 
by which health co-benefi
 ts are achieved (exposure to air 
pollution, transport-related physical activity patterns, and 
dietary survey data), and regulations (eg, restrictions on 
polluting 
vehicles, 
energy 
sources, 
and 
energy 
performance) in sectors that are also responsible for 
emissions. The Lancet Countdown will also seek to 
engage with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) 
to identify potential opportunities for monitoring the 
mitigation 
of 
short-lived 
climate 
pollutants 
and 
associated health benefi
 ts. Country-specifi
 c trends in 
greenhouse gas emissions can be assessed through the 
UNFCCC reporting mechanisms, and notifi
 cation is 
subject to new reporting requirements.
3.1–3.5: The energy sector
The energy sector (both production and usage) represents 
the largest single source of anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions globally, producing an estimated two-
thirds of such emissions.15,45 The energy sector is also the 
pre 
dominant source of air pollution, with almost all 
globally produced sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
emissions, as well as around 85% of particulate matter, 
resulting from energy production and energy use in 
buildings, industry, and transport.46
3.1: Coal phase-out
Coal use comprises 29% of total global fuel use.47 Globally, 
coal is used to generate 40% of electricity and, among all 
energy sources for electricity production, coal-fi
 red 
energy generation contributes most (50%) to ambient air 
pollution (and consequently to adverse impacts on health) 
and to carbon dioxide emissions.48 Coal is responsible for 
approximately 60% of global sulphur dioxide emissions. 
Coal use grew steadily until 2014, with China being the 
major user of coal; China has contributed to over 80% of 
global growth since 2000, and to approximately 50% of 
total global coal use.48
Counts of the number and capacity of coal-fi
 red plants, 
their use of coal, and their emissions can be monitored, 
but estimates of the loss of life expectancy attributable to 
ambient air pollution caused by coal-fi
 red combustion 
are also needed. Estimation of such burdens is 
theoretically 
possible, 
but 
requires 
high-quality 
emissions inventory data, and modelling on sources of 
human exposure to air pollution. These estimations are 
feasible in data-rich settings (primarily developed or 
high-income countries), but not universally. The 
International Energy Agency (IEA) produces market 
reports on coal use and forecasts for both OECD member 
countries and non-OECD member countries.48 The data 
are derived from country-level estimates of installed 
capacity, fuel consumption, or power generation; the fuel 
mix of coal and emission standards will be used to derive 
estimates of coal-related air pollution. Initially, this 
analysis will be feasible in specifi
 c geographical locations, 
with the ambition to expand the work globally.

3.2: Growth in renewable energy
Globally, renewable energy from wind, solar, thermal, 
photovoltaic, hydropower, tidal, geothermal, biofuel, and 
waste sources comprised 14% of the total primary energy 
supply, 22% of global electricity generation, and 
accounted for nearly half of the new generation capacity 
added in 2014.47,49 Renewable energy off
 ers several 
important potential mechanisms for addressing climate 
change and improving health. Most forms of renewable 
energy produce no direct emissions related to electricity 
generation (with the exception of biomass) and therefore 
help alleviate exposure to air pollution. Renewable energy 
can also be deployed as a decentralised system, providing 
greater penetration and provision of modern energy to 
hard-to-reach populations and health facilities.
Growth in the use of renewable energy is primarily 
measured in terms of capacity and total fi
 nal energy 
consumption. The Lancet Countdown plans to use this 
metric and the regularly published estimates of the IEA 
and International Renewable Energy Agency as an 
indicator of growth in renewable energy.
3.3: Access to clean energy
Access to adequate and clean energy supplies in 
households off
 ers numerous benefi
 ts to health as well as 
improved life expectancy.8,50 In 2013, the IEA estimated 
that around 1·2 billion people do not have access to 
electricity and around 2·7 billion people rely on burning 
unsustainable and ineffi
  cient solid fuels for cooking and 
heating.47 The household air pollution that results from 
these fuels and other sources contributes to around 
4·3 million deaths annually, which are related to 
pneumonia, stroke, lung cancer, heart disease, and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.51 Although access 
to electricity is increasing, with the current average 
national electrifi
 cation rate being 83%, there is enormous 
variability, with urban access to electricity as low as 1–4% 
in South Sudan, Liberia, and the Central African 
Republic.52,53
For the purposes of the Lancet Countdown, the IEA and 
World Bank produce national statistics on metrics of 
energy use that are based on surveys and data provided 
by member countries and their own research. These 
metrics include energy use per capita, the percentage of 
the population with access to non-solid fuels, and the 
percentage of the population with access to electricity. 
The SDG indicators focus on access to non-solid fuels 
and electricity. The Lancet Countdown is also exploring 
the feasibility of monitoring the expansion of microgrids 
in low-resource settings as an important component of 
the expansion of renewable energy and the health eff
 ects 
of changes in household air pollution.
3.4: Energy access for health facilities
Access to energy is crucial for the delivery of health care. 
A consistent energy supply is essential for provision 
of adequate lighting, refrigeration and cold chain 
management of medicines, controlling of indoor thermal 
exposure, and access to hot water for washing, 
sterilisation, and clinical procedures. In low-income 
countries, health-care facilities struggle to ensure access 
to consistent and aff
 ordable energy. A review of health-
care facilities in several sub-Saharan countries showed 
that, on average, 26% of the facilities examined had no 
access to electricity; 28% had reliable access to electricity, 
and 7% relied solely on generators.54 WHO has proposed 
a multi-tier metric for assessing access to electricity in 
health-care facilities, and this metric includes peak power 
capacity, daily energy capacity, duration of supply, 
evening peak hours supply, aff
 ordability, quality, 
reliability, operational sustainability, environmental 
sustainability, and environmental health.55 This metric 
has yet to be operationalised, but the Lancet Countdown 
will draw on this measure for reporting on energy access 
in the health-care sector where feasible.
3.5: Exposure to ambient air pollution
An estimated 18 000 people die every day because of 
exposure to ambient and household air pollution, making 
it the world’s largest single environmental health risk. 
Potential indicators relevant to exposure to household air 
pollution are discussed above in indicator domain 3.3. 
Ambient air pollution is particularly pertinent in urban 
areas, but it also aff
 ects non-urban populations.56 As 
fi
 gure 2 shows, about 80% of people living in urban areas 
around the world are exposed to air pollution levels in 
excess of WHO guidelines. This number rises to 98% for 
urban populations in low-income and middle-income 
countries.46,57 Moreover, current evidence suggests that 
health eff
 ects occur even at concentrations below the 
WHO guideline levels, so reducing air pollution can be 
expected to lead to health benefi
 ts regardless of initial 
concentrations.
WHO’s Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database 
now includes annual mean outdoor concentrations of the 
particulates PM10 and PM2·5 for almost 3000 cities. 
This database will thus serve as an important data source 
for the Lancet Countdown. We propose to track various 
indicators of urban air pollution, primarily annual mean 
PM2·5 or PM10, or both, together with other selected 
pollutants (eg, nitrogen dioxide), using data for individual 
cities and, where feasible, population-weighted averages 
for other geographical scales. As it is diffi
  cult to measure 
exposure to household air pollution, it may be best to use 
the SDG indicators 7
.1.1 (Proportion of population with 
access to electricity) and 7
.1.2 (Proportion of population 
with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology).
3.6 and 3.7: The transport sector 
Transportation systems—including road vehicles, rail, 
shipping, and aviation—are a key source of greenhouse 
gas emissions, contributing to 14% of global greenhouse 
gas emissions in 2010.46,47,58 The transport sector is also a 
major source of air pollutants, including particulate 
 Review

matter, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon 
monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and, indirectly, 
ozone. The IEA estimates that over half of global nitrogen 
oxide emissions are produced by the transport sector.46
3.6: Deployment of low-emission vehicles and access to public 
transport
Switching to low-emission transport systems is an 
important component of climate change mitigation and 
will help reduce concentrations of most ambient air 
pollutants; however, in some settings, this approach might 
counterintuitively lead to greater concentrations of ozone 
because of the titration eff
 ect of nitrogen dioxide.5 Personal 
exposure to traffi
  c-related air pollution is a function of both 
ambient concentrations (a function of vehicle technology 
and other factors) and time activity patterns.59–63 The IEA 
maintains a technical-economic database that includes 
detailed information on transport activity, vehicle activity, 
energy demand, and well-to-wheel greenhouse gas and 
pollutant emissions.64 The IEA’s Global Electric Vehicle 
Outlook report tracks sales of electric vehicles, and the 
International Council on Clean Transportation maintains 
a set of data tables, comparison charts, and a conversion 
tool for comparing passenger vehicle fuel standards. These 
types of databases and methods will provide the 
quantitative backing to this indicator domain for the 
Lancet Countdown, which will track the deployment of 
clean transport technology (eg, electric vehicles) and sector-
specifi
 c emission factor trends at a variety of geographical 
scales. SDG indicator 11.2.1 (Proportion of population that 
has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and 
persons with disabilities) will also be tracked.
3.7: Active travel infrastructure and uptake
Decarbonisation of the vehicle fl
 eet is essential for meeting 
climate change mitigation targets and improving urban air 
quality. However, in most settings promoting increased 
uptake of active travel (walking and cycling) for shorter 
journeys off
 ers greater opportunity for public health 
benefi
 ts, as active travel can lead to appreciable 
improvements in levels of physical activity at a population 
level, with all the attendant benefi
 ts in terms of reduced 
risk of cardiovascular disease, selected cancers, dementia, 
and diabetes, as well as improvements in mental wellbeing. 
Although these benefi
 ts might be partly off
 set by increased 
exposure to road danger and, in some settings, increased 
exposure to ambient air pollution, the injury risks can be 
moderated by policies to improve road safety.7
Indicators 
under 
consideration 
include 
(where 
available) the proportion of journeys taken, and distance 
covered, on foot and on bicycles in major urban areas. 
Such data require travel surveys, which are routinely 
implemented with comparable methods only in selected 
(mainly high-income) settings. In these cases, data could 
be collected on the duration of active travel and the 
number of road crashes that occur. Other population 
health and activity data could be used to monitor how 
changes in active travel contribute to population health, 
but to date they have seldom been assessed outside 
research studies.
3.8: Greenhouse gas emissions from the food system 
and healthy diets
There is growing evidence to suggest that more sustainable 
food systems and dietary changes have a benefi
 cial eff
 ect

on health. Sub-indicators under this heading will thus 
consider how food consumption and production aff
 ects 
and is aff
 ected by climate change, and will monitor the 
additional eff
 ects of these processes on health.
Consumption
Although all foods contribute to the emission of climate 
pollutants to varying extents, meat and dairy products are 
among those with the greatest greenhouse gas footprints. 
Meat and dairy products also contribute to water scarcity, 
land use changes, and erosion, and ultimately increase 
the risk of cardiovascular disease as well as some cancers 
(in the case of red and processed meats).65 Emissions per 
unit protein produced are especially high for ruminants 
(cattle, goat, and sheep), compared with pork, poultry, 
and particularly legume production. Although tracking 
trends in consumption patterns—especially of meat, 
dairy, and vegetables—is desirable, calculation of the 
associated greenhouse gas emissions is particularly 
complex, as is the computation of any resultant health 
eff
 ects. In certain low-income and middle-income 
countries, the contribution of livestock to greenhouse gas 
emissions might be less substantial than in most high-
income countries. Additionally, in many low-income and 
middle-income countries, animal products may provide 
an invaluable source of nutrients, particularly to children 
and pregnant women.66 Measures of consumption of 
meat, dairy products, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, 
derived from standardised population dietary surveys, 
could be used to track average per capita changes 
in consumption. However, data from nationally 
representative surveys are not widely available. Case 
studies might therefore be a useful tool for highlighting 
the health and climate benefi
 ts of more sustainable diets.
Production
Agricultural production can be a major contributor to 
greenhouse gas emissions. As such, there is clear room 
for improvement in management of water, carbon, and 
nitrogen in over-fertilised regions (eg, China and India) 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution 
from agricultural lands and enhance environmental 
sustainability.67 For example, it is estimated that in the 
farmlands of China, an improvement in nitrogen use 
effi
  ciency from 31% to 50% would cut synthetic nitrogen 
use by 41%, and greenhouse gas emissions by 39%.68 The 
second element of this indicator domain will therefore 
track changes in food production and food waste over 
time and the consequent impacts upon greenhouse gas 
emissions and health. Greenhouse gas emissions 
associated with agriculture (including livestock systems 
and biogeochemical processes) will be quantifi
 ed with 
the use of existing models (eg, the DAYCENT or 
DeNitrifi
 cation-DeComposition [DNDC] models).69–71
An understanding is needed of the potential for 
multiple environmental factors to aff
 ect food systems, 
and the nuances within and between countries and 
cultures. Further work will be required to refi
 ne 
indicators for this area, and the scientifi
 c community is 
invited to suggest potential metrics and data sources.
3.9: Greenhouse gas emissions of health-care systems
The health sector is a major contributor to greenhouse 
gas emissions, and has both a special responsibility and 
an appreciably measurable opportunity to lead by 
example in reducing its carbon footprint. Pharma-
ceuticals, for example, are associated with high levels of 
avoidable greenhouse gas emissions, and there is 
nearly always scope for savings in transport and 
procuring of goods needed to support the health-care 
system.72 Such actions have already been shown to 
deliver health, social, environmental, and economic 
benefi
 ts, both immediately and in the long term. 
Calculation of the carbon intensity and emissions of the 
health sector has been achieved in England and the 
USA (serially in England), despite the diffi
  culties in 
capturing all inputs to provide comparable data over 
time, place, and sub-sector.73–75 For the purposes of the 
Lancet Countdown, we will initially collect purposive 
samples from countries where data are available to 
raise the profi
 le of the topic within the health 
community locally, nationally, and globally.
4: Economics and fi
 nance
Article 2 of the Paris Agreement establishes the 
importance of ensuring fi
 nancial fl
 ows consistent with a 
pathway towards a low-carbon economy. The Lancet 
Countdown’s fourth working group will focus on the 
ways in which fl
 ows of fi
 nance and economic incentives 
are developing to accelerate progress on health and 
climate change. Indicators for this working group will 
fall into three broad themes: investment in a low-carbon 
economy; valuing the health co-benefi
 ts of climate 
change mitigation; and pricing the health externalities of 
fossil fuels.
4.1–4.3: Investing in a low-carbon economy
Having made the case for a comprehensive response to 
climate change and the resultant health benefi
 ts, three of 
the proposed indicator domains in the fourth working 
group will track the level of investment in a low-carbon 
economy—specifi
 cally, in renewable energy, energy 
effi
  ciency, and innovation.
The fi
 rst two indicator domains in this theme are 
closely 
linked: 
measuring 
changes 
in 
annual 
investments in renewable energy and in energy 
effi
  ciency. In order to decarbonise the global energy 
system and to meet the global climate change 
commitments outlined in the Paris Agreement, while 
simultaneously managing a rise in demand for energy 
over the coming decades, low-carbon technologies and 
energy effi
  ciency should account for around 90% of the 
US$2·5 trillion global annual investment required 
by 2035. In 2014, this value stood at 23%.76 Data for 
 Review
10 
www.thelancet.com   Published online November 14, 2016   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32124-9
annual global investment in renewable energy are 
compiled and reported by Bloomberg New Energy 
Finance. Tracking annual global investment in energy 
effi
  ciency, however, might be more diffi
  cult, as there is 
no standard, agreed defi
 nition on what constitutes 
investment in energy effi
  ciency, which involves a 
multitude of agents (often without the use of external 
fi
 nance) and is diffi
  cult to disaggregate from other 
activities. One approach is to estimate investment in 
energy effi
  ciency through modelling techniques. 
Further work will include discussions with the IEA and 
other organisations to determine the most appropriate 
defi
 nition and to determine how estimates of investment 
could be calculated. Estimates of total energy system 
investment are also published frequently by the 
IEA, allowing a proportional value for low-carbon 
technologies and energy effi
  ciency to be calculated.
The third indicator domain in this group would track 
innovation in the low-carbon sector, by measuring 
annual changes in the generation of patents for low-
carbon and energy-effi
  cient technologies. Data for such 
calculations could be taken from various databases (eg, 
the European Patent Offi
  ce Worldwide Database) and 
would capture the results of a substantial proportion of 
research and development eff
 orts, and funding from 
both the public and private sectors.
4.4: Valuing the health co-benefi
 ts of climate change 
mitigation
Building on work from the third working group, the 
fourth indicator domain will aim to capture the costs and 
savings resulting from the health co-benefi
 ts of climate 
change mitigation across several sectors. In particular, 
this indicator will evaluate the health-related economic 
benefi
 ts (or costs) of changes in coal-based electricity 
generation and conventional car sales (ie, petrol and 
diesel), and an increase in active travel. The annual value 
of the health eff
 ects of ambient air pollution, principally 
caused 
by 
coal-based 
electricity 
generation 
and 
conventional vehicles, is estimated to be as high as 
$3·5 trillion (~5% of GDP) in OECD countries, India, 
and China.77 Estimates of health-related economic 
benefi
 ts that result from climate change mitigation 
policies would draw on indicators compiled and reported 
by the third working group (eg, coal phase-out rates, low-
emission vehicle sales, and investment in active travel). 
Depending on the fi
 nal form of the indicators presented 
by the third working group, these indicators could be 
produced either by relatively simple calculations or 
through the use of energy system models that compute 
emissions that result in local air pollution. In both cases, 
this indicator domain closely relates to the indicator 
domain corresponding to estimation of the health 
benefi
 ts of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) 
under the fi
 fth working group; these two indicator 
domains will thus be jointly refi
 ned to ensure they 
complement each other.
4.5–4.7: Pricing the health externalities of fossil fuels
The fi
 nal theme within this working group would 
measure whether we are getting the prices right to 
encourage the development of a low-carbon economy, 
and the resultant heath-related benefi
 ts this brings, 
including ensuring that that inequities are addressed. 
Three areas of work would fall under this theme. The 
fi
 rst concerns the presence of subsidies (such as tax 
breaks) for fossil fuel production and consumption, 
which incentivise their use and increase relative costs of 
renewable alternatives. In 2014, direct fossil fuel 
subsidies stood at around $490 billion—around four 
times the level of subsidy aff
 orded to the deployment of 
renewable energy. Although the reform of such subsidies 
between 2009 and 2014 means that current subsidy levels 
are around $117 billion lower than they would otherwise 
have been, much more needs to be done.47 The need for 
further reform of fossil fuel subsidies is recognised in 
SDG indicator 12c; this SDG indicator, which assesses 
these subsidies, could be used by the Lancet Countdown’s 
working group once it has been fully developed. However, 
further work will be needed to determine which 
defi
 nition of fossil fuel subsidies could be suitability 
used for the purposes of the Lancet Countdown.
The second indicator domain in this theme would cover 
the spread and strength of carbon pricing, which seeks to 
internalise the market externality of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gas emissions globally. Carbon pricing 
instruments currently cover around 12% of global 
greenhouse gas emissions, although with wide-ranging 
values (from under $1 per tonne of carbon dioxide 
equivalent [tCO2e] to around $130/tCO2e).78 This indicator 
might consist of two elements: the change in (and 
absolute level of) the proportion of global greenhouse gas 
emissions to which carbon pricing is applied, and the 
change in (and absolute value of) the weighted-average 
global carbon price. These data might be drawn directly 
from, or calculated on the basis of, the World Bank’s 
annual State and Trends of Carbon Pricing report.
The development of such indicators will complement 
the indicator domains tracking the level of investment in a 
low-carbon economy. Although the reduction of fossil fuel 
subsidies and increase in the spread and strength of 
carbon pricing pushes the fl
 ow of fi
 nances towards the 
deployment and development of low-carbon and energy-
effi
  cient technologies and measures, other policies such as 
renewable energy subsidies help to pull the fi
 nance fl
 ow 
towards such investments. The indicator domains tracking 
the level of investment in a low-carbon economy will 
implicitly measure the impact generated by both 
infl
 uences.
The issues reported thus far do not address potential 
concerns surrounding the equity of the low-carbon 
transition, with carbon pricing on fuels having potentially 
regressive impacts. These impacts might be dampened or 
avoided with appropriate public policies, such as 
environmental tax reform. Environmental tax reform

involves shifting the burden of tax from so-called “goods”, 
such as labour, environmentally benefi
 cial products, or 
actions, to so-called “bads”, such as pollution. Such a shift 
in economic incentives could, when well designed, 
produce a double dividend of environmental improvement 
with social and economic benefi
 t.79 As such, the third 
indicator domain under this theme concerns the use of 
revenue generated by carbon pricing instruments, with 
qualitative consideration for the intended end use of this 
revenue. Further work is required to determine whether 
revenue from the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies might 
also be included in this indicator.
5: Political and broader engagement
The fi
 fth working group will focus on the broader context 
within which progress on health and climate change is 
being made. These indicator domains will track the 
implementation of political commitments within the 
UNFCCC, alongside analysis of scientifi
 c and public 
engagement with health and climate change, which 
provide both background and context for policy 
implementation.
5.1: Public engagement with health and climate change
Globally, public engagement with climate change is 
mixed. In two surveys of a range of high-income, middle-
income, and low-income countries, most people 
considered that climate change was a “very serious 
problem” and “a major threat”, and would have a direct 
impact on the conditions for health.80,81 Asked when they 
thought climate change would start to substantially 
harm people in their country (now, in 10 years, in 
25 years, in 50 years, in 100 years, or never), the majority 
of respondents in most countries thought that their 
citizens were being substantially harmed now. Figure 3 
presents the proportions responding “now” and “in 
10 years”. As insuffi
  cient understanding of climate 
change is one of the largest perceived barriers to 
individual engagement, it is an important fi
 nding that 
the framing of climate change as a public health issue 
enhances engagement.82–84
The Lancet Countdown will bring together evidence on 
changes in public understanding relating to health and 
climate change—more specifi
 cally, in terms of the 
perceived threats and opportunities of the responses. 
One possible long-term but resource-intensive approach 
would be to use phone-based and online public opinion 
polling techniques across a range of countries and 
settings. In the interim, the Lancet Countdown proposes 
to undertake an annual analysis of social media to build a 
broad understanding of public perceptions and track the 
evolution of public engagement and knowledge. The 
Lancet Countdown’s social media analysis will track 
levels of public engagement with health and climate 
change over time and identify (1) key events that cause 
spikes in engagement; (2) whether such spikes result in 
longer-term engagement; and (3) countries where 
engagement is particularly high or low.
5.2 and 5.3: Academic publications on health and 
climate change, and inclusion of health and climate 
change within medical and public health curricula
The Lancet Countdown will also track scientifi
 c 
engagement with health and climate change. Annual 
reviews of published scientifi
 c articles, with the use of a 
bibliometric search relating to the terms “climate” and 
“health”, could provide a potentially useful indicator, 
showing research trends and coverage. Historical trends 
and 
research 
gaps, 
including 
disciplinary 
and 
geographical focus, could also be explored. This study 
will provide a more extensive and inclusive overview than 
previously published reports and reviews, and could also 
be a useful resource for informing future research 
funding by identifying gaps and priorities. A study 
protocol for this scoping review has been written and 
accepted for publication.85

To accompany an analysis of the academic literature, 
the Lancet Countdown will also follow the extent to which 
health and climate change is incorporated into the 
educational curricula of health professionals (initially 
focusing on medical professionals) around the world. 
This analysis would determine not just the inclusion of 
climate change in these curricula but also the emphasis 
on these issues (for example, whether this subject matter 
is mandatory or optional). This could be used to provide 
background context, rather than as an indicator in its 
own right.
5.4 and 5.5: Health and climate change in high-level 
statements of the UNFCCC and UNGA, and 
implementation and estimated health benefi
 ts of 
the NDCs
At the international level, the UNFCCC negotiations and 
the Paris Agreement provide an important framework 
for mitigation and adaptation policies. The fi
 nal two 
indicator domains would look to provide an overview of 
the extent to which human health and wellbeing is 
considered within these political processes. The 
penultimate indicator domain would examine the 
inclusion of health within the transcripts of high-
level statements delivered at the UNFCCC’s annual 
Conference of the Parties (COP), and the UN General 
Assembly. A database of COP transcripts has been 
compiled on an ad hoc basis and would require additional 
work, but a database of the UN General Assembly 
transcripts is readily available. The Lancet Countdown 
would analyse high-level statements to monitor how the 
inclusion and framing of health and climate change 
evolves over time. This work could be back-dated to 
include historical high-level statements, thus providing a 
longer time series for the analysis.
The fi
 nal indicator domain for the Lancet Countdown 
will estimate the health benefi
 ts or disadvantages of the 
NDCs. Initially, the NDCs and subsequent reports to the 
UNFCCC will be explored for substantive references and 
considerations of the association between public health 
and climate change. Over time, it is hoped that the 
potential health co-benefi
 ts of mitigation, from a 
reduction in air pollution, could be modelled. This would 
be conducted in a similar way to the analysis conducted 
by Höhne and colleagues86 in their 2015 assessment. 
Many of these changes could be captured by the 
UNFCCC’s non-state actor zone for climate action 
(NAZCA) process—a potential source for future 
indicators and monitoring.
Conclusion
The Lancet Countdown is an international, multi-
disciplinary research collaboration dedicated to tracking 
progress on health and climate change from 2016 to 2030.
It will be governed by a board comprising the research 
leads for each working group, and coordinated by a 
smaller executive team responsible for supporting the 
working groups to deliver and communicate the academic 
content. Over the coming months, the Countdown will 
work to establish an international advisory board, to 
provide strategic direction to the process and assist with 
policy and stakeholder engagement. This advisory board 
will be made up of academics and senior experts on 
health and climate change from a broad range of 
geographical regions.
The indicators and indicator domains proposed in this 
paper are intended to form the foundation of our process, 
and will be further refi
 ned and developed over the coming 
months and throughout the Lancet Countdown’s process. 
We invite ongoing direct input on the content, methods, 
and data relating to each of these indicators, through the 
forms available on the Lancet Countdown website.
