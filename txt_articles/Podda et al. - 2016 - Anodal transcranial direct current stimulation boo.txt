The effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on brain functions and the underlying 
molecular mechanisms are yet largely unknown. Here we report that mice subjected to 20-min anodal 
tDCS exhibited one-week lasting increases in hippocampal LTP, learning and memory. These effects 
were associated with enhanced: i) acetylation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) promoter 
I; ii) expression of Bdnf exons I and IX; iii) Bdnf protein levels. The hippocampi of stimulated mice also 
exhibited enhanced CREB phosphorylation, pCREB binding to Bdnf promoter I and recruitment of CBP 
on the same regulatory sequence. Inhibition of acetylation and blockade of TrkB receptors hindered 
tDCS effects at molecular, electrophysiological and behavioral levels. Collectively, our findings suggest 
that anodal tDCS increases hippocampal LTP and memory via chromatin remodeling of Bdnf regulatory 
sequences leading to increased expression of this gene, and support the therapeutic potential of tDCS 
for brain diseases associated with impaired neuroplasticity.
Numerous studies provided molecular and functional evidence linking synaptic plasticity in certain brain areas 
to specific motor and cognitive functions1,2. Additionally, altered synaptic plasticity has been associated to neu-
ropsychiatric disorders3 and cognitive impairment4. Thus targeting synaptic plasticity may provide a major break-
through for therapeutic interventions.
A very promising approach is the use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and, in particular, tran-
scranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) due to its ease of use and beneficial effects on brain functions in healthy 
subjects as well as in patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases5–9.
Early studies demonstrated that tDCS induces polarity-dependent changes in membrane excitability, with 
anodal tDCS causing depolarization and cathodal tDCS hyperpolarization of membrane potential in neurons of 
the stimulated areas10–13.
Changes in neuronal excitability and behaviors were reported to persist after tDCS14–16 thus raising the ques-
tion on whether synaptic plasticity phenomena are involved in tDCS’s action17. So far, a direct link between tDCS 
and synaptic plasticity was proposed by very few studies, including ours. Fritsch et al.18 showed that anodal DCS 
applied to mouse motor cortex in vitro induced NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation 
(LTP) when the stimulus was given concomitantly with synaptic activation. We demonstrated that anodal stim-
ulation applied to hippocampal slices increased the magnitude of LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses whereas cathodal 
DCS decreased it19. More recently, Rohan et al.20 reported that in vivo tDCS increased LTP and paired-pulse 
facilitation in rat hippocampus.
To advance our understanding of tDCS action on brain functions we studied the effects and the duration 
of anodal tDCS on hippocampal synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, molecular and behavioral levels.

We focused our attention on molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for long-lasting effects. Bdnf was 
considered a good candidate given its involvement in LTP and memory21,22. The structure of Bdnf, i.e., eight 5′ 
non-coding exons and a 3′ 
 coding exon (IX) under the control of multiple promoters, allows differential reg-
ulation of gene expression by several stimuli23,24. In particular, memory formation is accompanied by changes 
in chromatin structure involving enhanced histone 3 (H3) acetylation on specific Bdnf promoters, leading to 
increased expression of exon I and IX mRNAs25. These data grounded the rationale to test whether anodal tDCS 
affected Bdnf expression via epigenetic modifications, in a fashion resembling neuronal activation.
Results
Long-term potentiation is enhanced in mouse hippocampus following anodal tDCS. 
We pre-
viously demonstrated that in vitro DCS of hippocampal slices induced polarity-dependent modulation of LTP 
at CA3-CA1 synapses19. As cornerstone data for further analysis we first ascertained whether tDCS (350 μA) 
applied for 20 min to the skull of behaving mice and targeting the hippocampal formation elicited similar effects 
on hippocampal LTP.
Field evoked post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were measured in the CA1 area after standard high-frequency 
stimulation (HFS) of Schaffer collaterals and LTP was measured in slices from both sham- (control) and 
tDCS-stimulated mice that were sacrificed soon after the tDCS (Fig. 1).
Sixty min after HFS slices from mice subjected to anodal tDCS showed significantly greater LTP than con-
trols (115.1 ± 
 11.8% [n = 
 10 slices from 5 mice] vs. 80.8 ± 
 7.5% [n = 
 16 slices from 8 mice]; P = 
 0.01, unpaired 
Student’s t-test; Fig. 2a,b). Reduced LTP was instead observed in slices from mice undergone to cathodal tDCS 
(32.8 ± 
 9.3% [n = 
 10 slices from 4 mice] vs. 88.6 ± 
 17.5% [n = 
 9 slices from 4 control mice]; P = 
 0.004, unpaired 
Student’s t-test; Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). These results indicate that hippocampal synaptic plasticity can be tar-
geted and effectively modulated by in vivo tDCS.
A set of experiments was also performed to check whether unilateral tDCS also affected LTP in the contralat-
eral hippocampus. Results showed that LTP values in the right hippocampus were slightly smaller but not signifi-
cantly different from those obtained in the left side (P = 
 0.83, unpaired Student’s t-test), thus suggesting that tDCS 
also affected the hippocampus contralateral to the stimulating electrode.

Control experiments were performed to assess the specificity of the observed effects. To this aim we recorded 
LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses in slices obtained from mice that had undergone sham stimulation (n = 
 8 slices from 2 
mice) or tDCS (n = 
 6 slices from 2 mice) of the left primary motor cortex26. Under these experimental conditions 
no changes in hippocampal LTP were observed following tDCS (P = 
 0.59 vs. control, unpaired Student’s t-test; 
Supplementary Fig. 1c). Further control experiments were performed to assess tissue viability following tDCS. 
Histological evaluation by hematoxylin-eosin staining was carried out in 6 mice (n = 
 3 control and n = 
 3 receiv-
ing anodal tDCS; Supplementary Fig. 1d) and it revealed no signs of neurotrauma27.
Our subsequent studies focused on anodal tDCS effects given their potential use to counteract impaired 
synaptic plasticity in normal aging or disease. Thereinafter animals receiving anodal tDCS are referred to as 
“tDCS-mice”
.
To check whether enhanced LTP following anodal tDCS was due to changes in basal synaptic transmission, 
we first examined input-output (I/O) curves obtained by plotting fEPSP amplitude against stimulus intensities. 
No significant differences were found between I/O curves of control and tDCS-mice (same slices used for LTP; 
P > 
 0.5 at all stimulus intensities, two-way repeated measure [RM] ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test; 
Fig. 2c). Similar results were obtained by plotting the amplitude of presynaptic fiber volleys against the amplitude 
of fEPSPs (P = 
 0.86, unpaired Student’s t-test; Fig. 2d).
Next, we studied the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) that provides information on neurotransmitter release prob-
ability28. Stimulation of the Schaffer collateral consistently produced paired-pulse facilitation in all slices tested 
and the PPR was not significantly different between the two groups (PPR: 1.68 ± 
 0.07 in slices from tDCS-mice 
vs. 1.64 ± 
 0.07 in controls; P = 
 0.72, unpaired Student’s t-test; Fig. 2e). Finally, in whole-cell patch-clamp record-
ings we measured the ratio of AMPAR-mediated evoked post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) to NMDAR-mediated 
EPSCs, that is a standard test to detect changes in synaptic strength29,30. This parameter was not significantly 
affected by tDCS (1.0 ± 
 0.2 [n = 
 14 cells from 3 tDCS-mice] vs. 0.9 ± 
 0.3 [n = 
 12 cells from 3 control mice]; 
P = 
 0.13, Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 2f).
Collectively, these data indicate that effects of anodal tDCS on LTP are independent of changes in basal syn-
aptic efficiency.
Spatial learning and memory are improved in mice subjected to anodal tDCS. 
Having shown 
that anodal tDCS increased hippocampal LTP, we determined whether hippocampal-dependent learning and 
memory were similarly affected by comparing the performance of control and tDCS-mice in the MWM and NOR 
tasks. These behavioral tests were started 24 h after the end of tDCS or sham stimulation (Fig. 1).
In the acquisition session of the MWM all mice successfully acquired the task with latency to reach the plat-
form decreasing progressively across training days (main effect of days: F3,48 = 
 37.8, P < 
 0.001, two-way RM 
ANOVA; Fig. 3a). Notably, tDCS-mice performed better than controls (n = 
 9 mice/group; F1,48 = 
 21.2, P < 
 0.001 
for overall acquisition). As far as the differences we observed on day 1 (main effect of tDCS: F1,80 = 
 10.5, P = 
 0.005, 
two-way RM ANOVA), there were no significant differences between control and tDCS-mice in the first two

 37.8, P <

particular, tDCS-mice displayed a significant increase in the time spent in the target quadrant (black bars)

trials (P = 
 0.29 and P = 
 0.28 for trial 1 and trial 2, respectively, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc) indi-
cating equal baselines. Similar results were obtained analyzing the length of the swim path (main effect of days: 
F3,48 = 
 31.7, P < 
 0.001; main effect of treatment: F1,48 = 
 14.1, P = 
 0.002; day 1: P = 
 0.67 and P = 
 0.41 for trial 1 and 
trial 2, respectively, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Supplementary Fig. 2).
In the probe test performed 24 h after the last training trial all mice showed a preference for the target quad-
rant (main effect of quadrant: F3,48 = 
 71.8, P < 
 0.001, two-way RM ANOVA). Notably, tDCS-mice spent more 
time in the target quadrant compared to controls (40.6 ± 
 3.0 s vs. 30.3 ± 
 3.3 s, P < 
 0.001; F3,48 = 
 4.7, P = 
 0.006 
for interaction between tDCS and time in quadrants; two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 3b), thus 
indicating improved spatial memory.
Furthermore, in the NOR tDCS-mice showed a greater preference toward the novel object than control mice 
(preference index: 75.1 ± 
 2.3% and 66.5 ± 
 3.4%, respectively; n = 
 9 for each group, P = 
 0.04, unpaired Student’s 
t-test; Fig. 3c), supporting the beneficial effects of anodal tDCS on learning and memory.
Effects of anodal tDCS on hippocampal LTP, learning and memory persist one week after stim-
ulation. 
To gain information on the duration of anodal tDCS effects on hippocampal plasticity we repeated 
LTP experiments and behavioral tests 1 week after tDCS (Fig. 1). Interestingly, LTP elicited by HFS in slices 
from tDCS-mice was significantly higher compared to that of control slices (95.5 ± 
 3.8% [n = 
 11 slices from 6 
tDCS-mice] vs. 78.6 ± 
 6.1% [n = 
 9 slices from 5 control mice], P = 
 0.02, unpaired Student’s t-test; Fig. 4a,b).
Consistent with the view that hippocampal-dependent learning and memory rely on LTP31,32, tDCS-mice 
also performed better than controls in MWM and NOR tests started 1 week after tDCS (Fig. 4c–e). In the MWM 
all mice displayed decreases in the latency to reach the hidden platform over training days (main effect of days: 
F3,42 = 
 28.5, P < 
 0.001, two-way RM ANOVA), however tDCS-mice showed reduced latency to reach the hidden 
platform than controls (n = 
 9 control mice and n = 
 7 tDCS-mice; F1,42 = 
 6.8, P = 
 0.021 for overall acquisition; 
Fig. 4c).
The persistence of effect of tDCS on spatial memory was then confirmed by enhanced time spent in the tar-
get quadrant by tDCS-mice compared to controls (39.7 ± 
 2.3 s vs. 30.7 ± 
 3.2 s, respectively, P = 
 0.0064, two-way 
RM ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 4d). Interaction between tDCS and quadrant was statistically significant 
(F3,42 = 
 2.9, P = 
 0.045, two-way RM ANOVA).
TDCS-mice also showed significantly greater preference toward the novel object than controls in the NOR test 
(preference index: 73.0 ± 
 1.7% and 66.2 ± 
 1.1%, respectively; n = 
 8 for each group, P = 
 0.004, unpaired Student’s 
t-test; Fig. 4e).
Anodal tDCS induces long-lasting changes in Bdnf expression by epigenetic mechanisms. 
Our 
next step was to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the long-lasting effects of tDCS on hippocam-
pal plasticity. Given the critical role of Bdnf in neuroplasticity-related events22,23, we checked if this neurotrophin 
was target of tDCS action.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis on hippocampal extracts obtained from mice sacrificed 24 h after stimu-
lation revealed that anodal tDCS induced differential regulation of exon-specific Bdnf mRNAs, with increased 
levels of exons I, VII, VIII, IXa and IX transcripts in tDCS-mice compared to controls (n = 
 4 mice for each group; 
exon I: P = 
 0.0003; exon VII: P = 
 0.005; exon VIII: P = 
 8E-07; exon IXa: P = 
 5E-06; exon IX: P = 
 1E-07; exons II, 
III, IV, V and VI: P > 
 0.3 vs. controls, unpaired Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 5a and Supplementary 
Fig. 3a).
These results were validated by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses focused on Bdnf common 
3′ coding exon IX and on exons I and IV that are highly responsive to neuronal activity23,24. Results confirmed 
tDCS-induced enhancement of Bdnf exon I and IX mRNAs (Fig. 5b). In particular, exon I mRNA levels were 
~9.5-fold higher in tDCS-mice than in controls 24 h after stimulation (n = 
 3 mice for each group; P < 
 0.001, 
Mann-Whitney test) and ~7-fold higher 1 week after tDCS (n = 
 3 mice for each group P < 
 0.001, Mann-Whitney 
test; Fig. 5b). At both time points we also found enhanced expression of Bdnf exon IX in tDCS mice (~3.7-fold 
and ~3.0-fold higher than controls at 24 h and 1 week, respectively; P < 
 0.001, Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 5b). 
Conversely, the levels of Bdnf exon IV transcripts were similar in control and tDCS-mice confirming that the 
induction of this exon was not affected by tDCS (P = 
 0.37 at 24 h and P = 
 0.7 at 1 week, unpaired Student’s t-test; 
Fig. 5b).
Next, we checked whether increased expression of Bdnf transcripts following tDCS was accompanied by 
enhanced levels of the protein. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) showed that 24 h as well as 1 week 
after tDCS hippocampal Bdnf levels were ~1.8 fold higher in tDCS-mice than in controls (n = 
 4 for each group/
time point; P = 
 1.08E-06 at 24 h, unpaired Student’s t-test; P < 
 0.001 at 1 week, Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 5c). No 
changes in Bdnf levels were detected in non-stimulated areas such as the cerebellum ipsilateral to the stimulation 
side (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Further control experiments showed that other neuronal genes (e.g., NeuN) were 
not affected by tDCS. Indeed Western blot analysis of hippocampal extracts from tDCS and control mice revealed 
no significant differences in NeuN expression, thus suggesting that Bdnf is specific target of tDCS (Supplementary 
Fig. 4b,c).
With regard to the mechanism leading to enhanced Bdnf expression it is well known that neuronal plasticity 
and memory formation are tightly modulated by the epigenetic regulation of gene expression via histone modi-
fications at particular gene promoter regions33. We hypothesized that anodal tDCS induced membrane depolar-
ization mimicking neuronal activation and triggered epigenetic changes at Bdnf, thus favoring its transcription. 
Notably, enhancement of Bdnf exon I, IV and IX transcripts and increased acetylation of histones at promoter I 
have been previously reported following neuronal activation23,24,34–36. As such, we examined whether changes in 
H3 acetylation at lysine 9 (H3K9ac) on Bdnf promoter I occurred after tDCS.

ChIP assay performed on hippocampi from mice sacrificed 24 h after tDCS or sham stimulation (n = 
 3 mice 
for each group) revealed that tDCS significantly enhanced H3K9ac at Bdnf promoter I (+ 
91%; P < 
 0.001 vs. con-
trols, Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 5d; see also Supplementary Fig. 3b). ChIP experiments repeated 1 week after tDCS 
revealed increased H3K9ac at Bdnf promoter I in tDCS-mice at this time point too (+ 
58%; P < 
 0.001 vs. controls; 
n = 
 3 for each group, Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 5d).
All together these results indicate that Bdnf expression in the hippocampus is induced by anodal tDCS and 
that enhanced acetylation at Bdnf promoter I is likely responsible for such effect.

We then asked whether tDCS effects might involve CREB/CREB-binding protein (CBP) signaling. Indeed, 
one pathway mediating neuronal activity-dependent histone acetylation involves activation of CREB that, once 
phosphorylated at Ser133 (pCREB133), binds the transcriptional coactivator CBP which acts as a histone acet-
yltransferase (HAT) thus altering chromatin structure of several genes including CREB itself and Bdnf 
36,37. We 
first checked whether anodal tDCS increased pCREB133 levels given that this stimulation has been reported to 
enhance intracellular Ca2+ signals38, that play a critical role in promoting CREB phosphorylation39. Hippocampi 
from control (n = 
 3) and tDCS-mice (n = 
 5) were collected two hours after tDCS and pCREB133 was assessed by 
Western blot analysis. Results showed that pCREB133 levels were significantly higher in hippocampal extracts 
from tDCS-mice than control mice (P = 
 0.015, unpaired Student’s t-test; Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Fig. 5).
Bdnf promoter I contains a CRE region proximal to the transcription start site and within the sequence 
amplified by the primers we designed for ChIP experiments23 (Supplementary Table 2). ChIP analyses were then 
carried out to assess CREB binding and CBP recruitment to Bdnf promoters. Results showed tDCS-dependent 
increases in CREB binding to the promoter I (+ 
300%; P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) and CBP recruitment to 
promoter I (+ 
181%; P < 0.00001, Mann-Whitney test; n = 
 3 mice for each group; same samples used to evaluate 
H3K9ac; Fig. 6c).

Collectively, these data suggest that anodal tDCS induced epigenetic changes at Bdnf promoters likely relying 
on a mechanism involving CREB activation, CBP recruitment and H3K9 acetylation.
To establish a causal link between enhanced acetylation and tDCS effects on plasticity we treated mice with 
either vehicle or the p300/CBP HAT inhibitor, curcumin40,41 (50 mg/kg body weight, i.p.; see Fig. 7a and Methods 
for injection schedule), and subjected animals to anodal tDCS or sham stimulation. Twenty-four hours after 
stimulation animals were engaged in the NOR and MWM (different set of animals were used for each behav-
ioral test). Control experiments showed that curcumin treatment efficiently inhibited histone H3 acetylation 
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
In the NOR vehicle- and curcumin-injected mice subjected to sham-stimulation (i.e., control groups) 
showed preference index > 
 50% (Fig. 7b) but, consistent with a role of acetylation in memory formation42, 
curcumin-injected controls showed lower preference index value (curcumin-injected mice [n = 
 8]: 56.9 ± 
 2.5%; 
vehicle-injected mice [n = 
 7]: 67.9 ± 
 2.5%; P = 
 0.005, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 7b). Most 
importantly, curcumin treatment prevented the enhancement of recognition memory by anodal tDCS. Indeed, 
vehicle-injected tDCS-mice showed increased preference index compared to their respective sham-stimulated 
controls (75.5 ± 
 2.6% [n = 
 7] vs. 67.9 ± 
 2.5% [n = 
 7], respectively; P = 
 0.005, Bonferroni post-hoc) whereas the 
performance of curcumin-treated mice exposed to tDCS did not significantly differ from that of sham-stimulated, 
curcumin-injected mice (57.1 ± 
 2.1% [n = 
 9] vs. 56.9 ± 
 2.5% [n = 
 8], respectively; P = 
 0.95, Bonferroni post-hoc; 
Fig. 7b). Two-way ANOVA also confirmed significant effects of either tDCS (F1,27 = 
 5.34; P = 
 0.029) or curcumin 
(F1,27 = 
 43.46; P < 
 0.001) and interaction between tDCS and curcumin (F1,27 = 
 5.00; P = 
 0.034).
A separate cohort of mice injected with curcumin was tested in the MWM. In line with data obtained with 
the NOR, curcumin treatment hindered tDCS effects. Indeed no significant differences were found between 
sham-stimulated and tDCS-mice (n = 
 9 and n = 
 8, respectively) injected with curcumin as to: i) the latencies to 
navigate to the platform (F1,45 = 
 0.0007, P = 
 0.98 for overall acquisition, two-way RM ANOVA; Fig. 7c); ii) the 
time spent in the target quadrant (27.5 ± 
 3.2 s in tDCS-mice and 25.4 ± 
 3.4 s in controls; P = 
 0.51, two-way RM 
ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 7d). Statistical analysis revealed that overall performance of the two groups of 
mice in both acquisition and probe test phase was not significantly impaired by curcumin treatment (acquisition: 
main effect of days: F3,45 = 
 28.83, P < 
 0.001; probe test: main effect of quadrant: F3,45 = 
 22.36, P < 
 0.001; time in 
the target quadrant vs. the other quadrants: P < 
 0.05 for both groups), thus supporting the view that blockade of 
HAT activity specifically interferes with tDCS effects on cognitive performances.
In a different set of experiments we tested whether curcumin also prevented the effects of tDCS we observed 
1 week after stimulation. To this aim we studied LTP in slices obtained from vehicle- or curcumin-treated mice 
sacrificed 1 week after stimulation (Fig. 7a). As expected, LTP was increased by tDCS in vehicle-treated ani-
mals (86.7 ± 
 9.0% [n = 
 9 slices from 4 tDCS-mice] vs. 65.9 ± 
 6.9% [n = 
 12 slices from 4 control mice]; P = 
 0.02, 
two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 7e,g), whereas no significant differences were found between 
tDCS and sham-stimulated animals pre-treated with curcumin (56.5 ± 
 6.7% [n = 
 9 slices from 3 tDCS-mice] 
vs. 56.6 ± 
 5.5% [n = 
 9 slices from 3 control mice]; P = 
 0.96, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 7f,g). 
Two-way ANOVA also showed that both sham-stimulated controls displayed similar LTP values (P = 
 0.28,

Bonferroni post-hoc) confirming the specific inhibitory effect of curcumin on tDCS-induced boosting of synaptic 
plasticity.
Additionally, blockade of HAT activity significantly reduced the tDCS-induced increase in hippocampal 
Bdnf levels we observed both 24 h and 1 week after stimulation (Fig. 7h). In particular, at 24 h Bdnf levels were: 
104.7 ± 
 4.39 ng/g in curcumin-injected tDCS mice vs. 95.9 ± 
 3.37 ng/g in curcumin-injected sham-stimulated 
controls (n = 
 4 mice for each group; P = 
 0.41, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc) and 245.47 ± 
 8.95 ng/g 
in vehicle-injected tDCS mice vs. 132.34 ± 
 11.81 ng/g in vehicle-injected controls (n = 
 4 mice for each group; 
P < 
 0.001, Bonferroni post-hoc). Overall, two-way ANOVA showed a main effect of either tDCS (F1,28 = 
 67.87, 
P < 
 0.001) or curcumin (F1,28 = 
 143.43, P < 
 0.001) and an interaction between tDCS and curcumin (F1,28 = 
 49.78, 
P < 
 0.001).
Similar results were obtained 1 week after tDCS. At this time point Bdnf values were: 93.6 ± 
 2.60 ng/g in 
curcumin-injected tDCS-mice vs. 86.8 ± 
 2.37 ng/g in curcumin injected sham-stimulated controls (n = 
 4 mice 
for each group; P = 
 0.49; two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc) and 228.0 ± 
 12.66 ng/g in vehicle-injected 
tDCS mice vs. 120.87 ± 
 6.22 ng/g in vehicle-injected controls (n = 
 4 mice for each group; P < 
 0.001; Bonferroni 
post-hoc; main effect of tDCS: F1,28 = 
 70.0, P < 
 0.001; main effect of curcumin: F1,28 = 
 153.16, P < 
 0.001; interac-
tion: F1,28 = 
 54.45, P < 
 0.001).
To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying tDCS effects on plasticity we sought to estab-
lish a causal link between the increased levels of Bdnf and tDCS effects. Mouse treatment with the inhibitor of 
the Bdnf receptor TrkB, ANA-1243 (0.5 mg/kg body weight, Fig. 8a), reduced the facilitatory effects of tDCS on 
learning and memory assessed by NOR and MWM tests. In the NOR test performed on vehicle-injected animals 
the preference index was 68.0 ± 
 3.2% and 76.6 ± 
 1.3% in sham-stimulated and tDCS-mice, respectively (n = 
 8 
for each group, P = 
 0.008 two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc); in ANA-12-treated animals the preference 
index was 63.6 ± 
 2.0% and 67.8 ± 
 2.3% in sham-stimulated and tDCS-mice, respectively (n = 
 8 for each group; 
P = 
 0.18, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 8b). Two-way ANOVA showed that recognition mem-
ory was not significantly impaired by ANA-12 treatment (P = 
 0.16 vehicle-injected vs. ANA-12-injected control 
groups, Bonferroni post-hoc).
In the MWM treatment with ANA-12 did not affect overall performance in all mice (n = 
 7 tDCS-mice and 
n = 
 7 sham-stimulated mice; F3,36 = 
 38.45, P < 
 0.001 for overall acquisition; two-way RM ANOVA) but prevented 
the tDCS-induced enhancement in learning the location of the hidden platform (P > 
 0.3 at each training days; 
tDCS-mice vs. controls, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 8c). Consistently, memory performance 
of stimulated mice treated with ANA-12 was not significantly improved by tDCS (24.7 ± 
 1.9 s vs. 22.2 ± 
 2.0 s in 
control mice; P = 
 0.19, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc; Fig. 8d). Statistical analysis showed that spa-
tial memory was not impaired by ANA-12 treatment (probe test: main effect of quadrant: F3,48 = 
 51.94, P < 
 0.001; 
time in the target quadrant vs. the other quadrants: P < 
 0.005 for both groups; Fig. 8d).
These results strongly support our hypothesis that increased histone acetylation promoting Bdnf transcription 
plays a major role in anodal tDCS-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity.
To investigate molecular pathways downstream of Bdnf/TrkB signaling potentially responsible for 
tDCS-induced increased synaptic plasticity we examined phosphorylation of Glycogen synthase kinase-3β 
(GSK-3β 
), that is a key regulated substrate of TrkB. Indeed, GSK-3β 
 is highly expressed in the rodent hippocam-
pus where it has been involved in the modulation of synaptic plasticity44. Notably, TrkB activation produces 
GSK-3β 
 inhibition by its phosphorylation at Serine 9 leading to enhanced LTP45. Hippocampi from control 
(n = 
 7) and tDCS-mice (n = 
 7) were collected 24 hours after tDCS and pGSK-3βSer9 levels were assessed by 
Western blot. Results showed that pGSK-3βSer9 levels were significantly higher in hippocampal extracts from 
tDCS-mice than control mice (P = 
 0.004, unpaired Student’s t-test; Fig. 8e,f). Interestingly, the tDCS-induced 
enhancement of pGSK-3βSer9 was not observed in tissues obtained from mice treated with ANA-12 (n = 
 3 for 
each group; P = 
 0.52, Fig. 8e,f). The ability of ANA-12 to prevent TrkB activation in our experimental model was 
confirmed by Western blot analysis showing that the levels of TrkB phosphorylated at Tyrosine816 was reduced 
in hippocampi from mice treated with ANA-12 compared to vehicle-injected mice (n = 
 5 ANA-12 injected mice 
vs. n = 
 4 vehicle-injected mice; P = 
 0.0006; unpaired Student’s t-test; Supplementary Fig. 7).
Discussion
The present study elucidated the impact of anodal tDCS on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and shed light on 
molecular mechanisms underlying the learning and memory improvement we observed in the stimulated mice.

Results showed that LTP was increased in hippocampal slices from mice subjected to anodal tDCS. tDCS-mice 
also performed better in the MWM and NOR tests. These effects were seen within hours after tDCS and, remark-
ably, they persisted 1 week. TDCS effects were due to enhanced exon-specific mRNA expression of Bdnf. The hip-
pocampi of tDCS-mice showed increased pCREBSer133 levels along with epigenetic modifications including CREB 
binding to the Bdnf promoter I, recruitment of the HAT CBP leading to enhanced H3K9ac on Bdnf promoter I. 
These results provide novel insights into molecular mechanisms underlying tDCS effects whose understanding is 
required for a rational use of this technique to potentiate/ameliorate brain functions.
The tDCS intensity we used was below the safety limits of this stimulation27,38, as such, no morphological 
alterations were found in brain tissues subjected to tDCS. The montage we used has been widely employed in 
rodents and it has been proven to specifically target the cortical brain area under the stimulating electrode and to 
reproduce results of tDCS in humans46–48. Furthermore, previous studies using similar devices in rodents demon-
strated that the path of current flowing between the electrodes penetrates not only the cortex but also sub-cortical 
structures including the hippocampus20,49,50. Although tDCS likely affected the brain cortex underneath the stim-
ulation electrode, the neurophysiological, behavioral and molecular changes investigated in our study were all 
related to hippocampal function. Indeed, anodal tDCS enhanced LTP at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses and 
improved spatial and recognition memory assessed by two validated behavioral tests of hippocampal-dependent 
memory, i.e., MWM and NOR51,52.
Our finding that LTP values in the hippocampus contralateral to the stimulating electrode were not signifi-
cantly different from those of the ipsilateral one might be related to input conveyed by hippocampal commissural 
connections.
On the other hand in control experiments no changes in hippocampal LTP were found when stimulation 
was delivered over the primary motor cortex, thus supporting the specificity of the observed effects. The finding 
that cathodal tDCS induced opposite effects on hippocampal LTP confirms our previous observations suggest-
ing polarity-dependent DCS effects on brain plasticity19, and further supports the specificity of the stimulation 
protocol we used. We attributed the effects of tDCS to modifications of synaptic plasticity rather than to changes 
in synaptic transmission since we found no significant differences between data collected in slices from tDCS- 
and sham-stimulated mice as to: i) input-output curves obtained by plotting fEPSP amplitude against stimulus 
intensities or against presynaptic fiber volleys, indicating no changes in basal synaptic transmission; ii) PPR, 
indicating that glutamate release probability at CA3-CA1 synapses was unaffected by tDCS; iii) AMPA/NMDA 
ratio, indicating that tDCS per se did not elicit changes in synaptic strength as also reported by Fritsch et al.18 in 
the motor cortex. Our findings are in agreement with data recently reported by Rohan et al.20 showing that anodal 
tDCS enhanced hippocampal LTP in rats without affecting basal synaptic transmission. The same authors also 
reported a transient effect of tDCS on PPR that did not parallel LTP changes: indeed increased PPR was only 
found in rats subjected to 30 min recovery after tDCS but not in those housed for 24 hours post-stimulation. 
In our experimental model no changes in PPR were found, probably because our recordings fell out of the time 
window of the transient changes observed by Rohan and coworkers and/or because of differences related to the 
different species we used.
Our findings are supported by previous reports suggesting that: i) DC stimulation modulates LTP elicited by 
other NIBS techniques53–55; ii) tDCS influences LTP-related learning and memory processes5; iii) tDCS effects 
on motor and cognitive functions are greater when stimulation is paired with “activity” engaging the subject’s 
stimulated brain area56.
Remarkably, we found that one 20-min tDCS elicited electrophysiological and behavioural effects clearly 
detectable 1 week later. These findings suggested us the engagement of molecular pathways retaining memory of 
stimulation and the possible involvement of epigenetic regulation of plasticity-related genes. Bdnf was the most 
likely candidate since it is highly activity-regulated through both transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms 
especially in the hippocampus, and the neurotrophin Bdnf is a key regulator of synaptic plasticity34. Of note, 
several lines of evidence indicate that the regulation of Bdnf activity is a correlate of hippocampus-dependent 
learning in vivo21 and converging studies implicate Bdnf in the responses to tDCS in humans and rodents18,57,58.
ChIP experiments performed on the hippocampi of control and tDCS-mice revealed that anodal stimulation 
increased H3K9ac at Bdnf promoter I. This effect was observed 24 h as well as 1 week after tDCS and was paral-
leled by enhanced expression of Bdnf exon I and common 3′ coding exon IX specific mRNAs. Consistently with 
our results histone acetylation levels on Bdnf promoters, especially promoter I, have been shown to affect LTP and 
long-term memories59. Consequently, disruption of HAT impairs several forms of learning and memory, includ-
ing novel object recognition, spatial learning in the MWM and fear conditioning60. Of note, recent work revealed 
a correlation among impaired LTP, reduced histone acetylation and altered Bdnf/TrkB signaling during aging. 
Such dysfunctional plasticity and impaired epigenetic pathways have also been observed in the prefrontal cortex 
and hippocampus of mouse models of depression and stress25,61. These data highlight the potential relevance of 
our findings for using tDCS as tool for epigenetic intervention strategy to treat diseases associated to impaired 
synaptic plasticity.
The link between the electrophysiological/functional outcomes of anodal tDCS and epigenetic changes at 
Bdnf promoters is supported by the inhibitory effects we observed following treatment with curcumin that is a 
specific p300/CBP HAT inhibitor at the concentration we used41. In curcumin-treated mice tDCS failed to induce 
significant increases in: i) learning and memory at both MWM and NOR; ii) LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses; iii) hip-
pocampal Bdnf levels.
The role of Bdnf pathway activation in the improved learning and memory we observed in tDCS-mice is 
demonstrated by results showing that in vivo administration of the Bdnf TrkB receptor inhibitor, ANA-12, abol-
ished the facilitatory effects of tDCS in both MWM and NOR.
Of note we found that tDCS enhanced GSK-3β 
 phosphorylation at Ser 9 inhibiting the enzyme activity44,45 
and this effect was prevented by ANA-12, indicating its dependence on activation of TrkB. Therefore inhibition

of GSK-3β 
 activity is likely one of the mechanism contributing to the LTP enhancement we found following 
tDCS. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that exogenous application of the Val66pro-form but not the 
Met66pro-form of Bdnf to hippocampal slices inhibited LTP and facilitated long-term depression through 
dephosphorylation of GSK-3β 
 at Ser 962. This study takes on particular relevance in light of our findings given 
that Bdnf Val66Met polymorphism is known to affect responses to tDCS in humans57.
Collectively, these data support the view that anodal tDCS boosts synaptic plasticity by enhancing Bdnf 
expression in response to LTP induction protocols and learning. Nevertheless, other plasticity-related genes, that 
are worth studying in future research, might cooperate with Bdnf in mediating tDCS action. If operating in other 
brain areas, the molecular mechanism we uncovered here is a plausible substrate for tDCS action on cognitive 
and motor functions documented in the literature. It also provides the rationale for using tDCS in combination 
with other training/stimulation protocols converging onto the same target genes. Within this clinical perspective 
elucidation of the molecular machinery whereby tDCS induces epigenetic changes at Bdnf favoring its transcrip-
tion is a very critical issue. In this regard we demonstrated that anodal tDCS increases CREB phosphorylation at 
Ser133 and CREB binding to Bdnf promoter I, which is hyperacetylated following tDCS. Tabuchi et al.63 reported 
that a CRE-like response element contributes to the activity-mediated induction of rat Bdnf promoter I whereas 
Pruunsild and coworkers24 showed that mutation in CRE did not alter the induction of human Bdnf, thus sug-
gesting differential regulation of promoter I activity by CREB at transcriptional level in humans and rodents. Our 
study linked tDCS-induced CREB binding at CRE element on promoter I to epigenetic changes likely involving 
recruitment of the HAT CBP at the same region. TDCS-dependent upregulation of Bdnf exon I mRNA is fully 
consistent with enhanced transcriptional activity at promoter I. Interestingly, exon IV transcript, that is the most 
induced Bdnf mRNA in response to neuronal activity, was not sensitive to tDCS, supporting the view that this 
non-pharmacological brain-treatment elicits exon-specific modulation of Bdnf.
Our data involving CREB/CBP in tDCS-mediated effects on plasticity are consistent with the critical role of 
CBP in CREB activity and epigenetic regulation of learning and memory37. Furthermore, they provide a plausible, 
yet not necessarily unique, mechanism for the enhanced acetylation and increased exon-specific Bdnf mRNA 
expression we observed following tDCS.
As for the molecular events linking tDCS to the above reported cascades leading to enhanced acetylation, it 
is reasonable to hypothesize the involvement of increased Ca2+ levels. TDCS effects have been directly or indi-
rectly associated with membrane depolarization-dependent increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels via NMDAR and 
Figure 9. Model of anodal tDCS-induced chromatin remodeling leading to enhanced hippocampal 
synaptic plasticity. Based on our data we propose that transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ during tDCS 
initiates molecular cascades leading to persistent changes in chromatin structure of Bdnf. These include the 
phosphorylation of CREB, its binding to Bdnf promoter I and recruitment of CBP. CBP, in turn, promotes 
H3K9 acetylation of Bdnf (specifically at promoter I) because of its HAT activity. As a result, stimuli such as LTP 
induction protocol in slices or learning and memory in vivo are more effective in promoting transcription of 
Bdnf previously primed by anodal tDCS.

Enhanced acetylation at the promoters of Bdnf and other potential target genes provides a molecular sub-
strate whereby tDCS influences synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus leading to enhanced LTP and cognitive 
performances. This mechanism might likely be engaged in other cortical areas targeted by tDCS protocols used 
in humans. Given that Bdnf and epigenetic regulation of gene expression are considered promising targets to 
potentiate synaptic plasticity in physiology and pathology our data ground and support the use of tDCS as viable 
therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.
Methods
Ethics and Animal Use Statement. 
Male C57bl/6 mice (30–45 day-old) were used and randomly assigned 
to two main groups: (i) tDCS-treated and (ii) sham-stimulated animals (controls). Different groups of mice were 
used for each experimental test and time point from tDCS.
All animal procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University and were fully 
compliant with Italian (Ministry of Health guidelines, Legislative Decree No. 116/1992) and European Union 
(Directive No. 86/609/EEC) legislations on animal research.
The methods were carried out in strict accordance with the approved guidelines.
The animals were housed under a 12-h light-dark cycle at room temperature (RT: 19–22 °C). Efforts were 
made to limit the number of animals used and to minimize their suffering.
Electrode implantation and transcranial direct current stimulation. 
For tDCS stimulation we 
adopted an electrode montage widely used and well validated in both rat and mouse models consisting in an uni-
lateral epicranial electrode arrangement48,49. Specifically, the active electrode consisted of an epicranial implanted 
tubular plastic jack (inner area = 
 6.25 mm2; model GB3305-00, Star electronic SPA, Italy) filled with saline solu-
tion (0.9% NaCl) just prior to stimulation; the counter electrode was a conventional rubber-plate electrode sur-
rounded by a wet sponge (5.2 cm2; Physiomed Elektromedizin AG, Germany) applied over the ventral thorax by 
a custom corset. According to the literature this unipolar arrangement prevents currents from bypassing between 
two juxtaposed epicranial electrodes.
For the epicranial electrode implant, animals were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (70 mg/Kg, intra-
muscular injection [i.m.]) and medetomidine (1 mg/Kg, i.m.) and temperature during surgery was maintained 
at 37 °C. The scalp and underlying tissues were removed and the electrode was implanted using a carboxylate 
cement (3 M ESPE, Durelon, 3 M Deutschland GmbH, Germany). The centre of the active electrode was posi-
tioned on the skull over the left hippocampal formation 1 mm left and 1 mm posterior to bregma26. After surgery, 
all animals were allowed to recover for 3–5 days before undergoing tDCS.
TDCS was applied to awake and freely moving mice at a current intensity of 350 μA for 20 min using a 
battery-driven, constant current stimulator (Stimulus Isolator, model: A385, World Precision Instruments, USA). 
This intensity corresponded to a current density of 56 μA/mm2 (0.35 mA/0.0625 cm2) that was within the range of 
that used previously in rats48 (57.1 μA/mm2) or mice38,49 (55.5 μA/mm2). The current intensity was ramped for 10 s 
instead of switching it on and off directly to avoid a stimulation break effect. The animals were observed during 
tDCS and in vivo experiments to determine possible abnormal behaviors related to the stimulation. Control ani-
mals received sham stimulation in which no current was applied but the animal underwent the same manipula-
tions as in the stimulation condition. We chose to apply tDCS over the left hippocampus given that, experimental 
evidences suggest that long-term memory processing is strictly dependent on the left hemisphere65.
Experimental design and protocol timeline of experiments are summarized in Figs 1, 7a and 8a. 
Electrophysiological, molecular and behavioral analyses were performed either at short-term (2–24 h) and 
long-term (7 days) intervals from sham stimulation or tDCS, to assess the duration of effects elicited by a single 
tDCS session.
Investigators were blinded to the identity of the groups during experiments and analysis.
Histological processing. 
Histological evaluation was carried out to detect possible current-induced neu-
rotrauma (e.g., oedema, necrosis, haematoma, cellular alterations). At the end of the stimulation session animals 
were deeply anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (80 mg/Kg, i.m.) and medetomidine (1 mg/Kg, i.m.) and 
perfused transcardially with saline followed by a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. After 
post-fixation, brains were removed from the skulls and stored at 4 °C in a high sucrose solution (30% sucrose in 
0.1 M PBS) for 2 days. A vibratome (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems) was used to collect serial coronal 40-μm thick 
sections containing the hippocampus. All sections were further processed for hematoxylin-eosin staining. Images 
were acquired with Olympus BX3-CBH microscope.
Electrophysiology. 
Whole-cell patch-clamp and field recordings were performed on hippocampal coronal 
slices (300- and 400-μm-thick, respectively) as previously described28,66,67. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by hal-
othane inhalation (Sigma) and decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed and put in ice-cold cutting solution 
(in mM: 124 NaCl, 3.2 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 2 sodium pyruvate, and 0.6 
ascorbic acid, bubbled with 95% O2-5% CO2; pH 7.4). Slices were cut with a vibratome (VT1000S) and incubated 
in artificial cerebrospinalfluid (aCSF; in mM: 124 NaCl; 3.2 KCl; 1 NaH2PO4, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2; 26 NaHCO3; 
10 glucose; pH 7.4; 95% O2-5% CO2) at 32 °C for 60 min and then at RT until use. Slices containing the left (i.e., 
stimulated) hippocampus were used for subsequent analyses.
Slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber and continuously perfused with aCSF (flow rate: 
1.5 ml/min). The bath temperature was maintained at 30–32 °C with an in-line solution heater and temperature

controller (TC-344B, Warner Instruments). Identification of slice subfields and electrode positioning were done 
with 4× 
 and 40× 
 water immersion objectives on an upright microscope equipped with differential interference 
contrast and fluorescence optics under infrared illumination (BX5IWI, Olympus) and video observation (C3077-
71 CCD camera, Hamamatsu Photonics).
All recordings were made using MultiClamp 700 A amplifier (Molecular Devices). Data acquisition and stim-
ulation protocols were performed with the Digidata 1440 Series interface and pClamp 10 software (Molecular 
Devices). Data were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed both online and offline.
Field recordings were made using glass pipettes filled with aCSF (tip resistance 2–5 MΩ 
) and placed in the 
stratum radiatum of the CA1 region. FEPSPs were evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals with a bipolar 
tungsten electrode (FHC, USA) connected to a S11 Grass stimulator (Grass Instruments).
The stimulation intensity that produced one-third of the maximal response was used for the test pulses, LTP 
induction and paired-pulse facilitation protocols. The fEPSP amplitude was measured from baseline to peak.
Before the LTP induction protocol, to check for a possible effect of tDCS on the basal synaptic transmission, 
I/O curves were obtained i) by recording fEPSPs induced by presynaptic stimulation at intensities ranging from 0 
to 50 V (in 5 V-steps); ii) by plotting fEPSP amplitudes against presynaptic fiber volley amplitudes and then com-
paring the angular coefficients of I/O slopes. On the same synapses paired-pulse facilitation was also examined 
at 50 ms interpulse intervals.
For LTP recordings, stable baseline responses to test stimulations (once every 20 s for 10 min) were recorded 
and then HFS was delivered (4 trains of 50 stimuli at 100 Hz, 500 ms each, repeated every 20 s)19,68. Responses 
to test pulse were recorded every 20 s for 60 min to assess LTP. LTP magnitude was expressed as the percentage 
change in the mean fEPSP peak amplitude normalized to baseline values (i.e., mean values for the last 5 min-
utes of recording before HFS, taken as 100%). The occurrence of LTP was statistically verified (paired Student’s 
t-test) by comparing mean fEPSP amplitude measured at 55–60 min after HFS relative to baseline responses 
(Supplementary Table 1). Slices were prepared soon after the delivery of stimulation protocol and LTP recordings 
started ~2 hours after tDCS or sham stimulation.
Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed to measure the AMPA/NMDA ratio, expressed as the 
peak AMPA evoked post-synaptic currents (EPSCs, mean values of 30–50 events) at − 
70 mV divided by the peak 
NMDA EPSCs (mean values of 20–40 events) measured at 50 ms after the onset of the dual EPSC component at 
+ 
40 mV.
For this set of recordings the electrodes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 135 CsMeSO3, 
8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.25 EGTA, 2 Mg2ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 0.1 spermine, 7 phosphocreatine and 5 QX-314 (pH: 
7.25–7.30; 294–298 mOsm/l). We monitored the access resistance and membrane capacity before and at the end 
of the experiments to ensure recording stability and the health of studied cells. Recordings were considered sta-
ble when the series and input resistances, resting membrane potential, and stimulus artifact duration did not 
change > 
 20%.
Behavioral tests. 
A set of animals was tested in the MWM and NOR that are the most widely used and 
standardized tests to investigate hippocampal-dependent learning and memory51,52. To better link changes of 
learning and memory performances to tDCS we avoided challenging the animals in more than one behavioral 
test. Therefore different groups of mice were used for each behavioral test and time point from tDCS (Fig. 1).
Mice were trained in the MWM to find a platform hidden 1 cm below the surface of a pool (127 cm in diam-
eter) filled with water made opaque with white nontoxic paint. The acquisition training session started 4 days 
before the test session (probe test) and consisted of six trials a day for 4 consecutive days, during which the 
animals were allowed to reach the platform within 40 s. Starting points were changed daily and different starting 
points were used for each trial. A trial lasted either until the mouse had found the platform or for a maximum of 
40 s. Mice rested on the platform for 10 s after each trial. Time (latency) needed to navigate to the platform and 
swim path length were recorded by an automated video tracking system (Panlab Harvard Apparatus). The probe 
test session was performed 24 h after the last day of the training. In this session, the platform was removed and 
each mouse was allowed to swim for 60 s; the time spent in each quadrant was measured69.
The NOR protocol lasted three consecutive days including a familiarization phase, a training phase and a 
test phase. On the 1st day, mice were individually submitted to a single familiarization session of 10 min, during 
which they were introduced into the empty arena (45 × 
 45 cm). On the 2nd day, animals were submitted to a single 
10 min session (training phase) during which two identical objects were placed in a symmetric position from the 
centre of the arena. An explorative behavior was scored when the head of the animal was facing close (> 
2 cm 
away) to the object or any part of the body except the tail was touching the object. The time spent exploring each 
object was recorded. The animals were returned to their home cages immediately after training. On the 3rd day, 
during the test phase, one of the familiar objects used during the training was replaced by a novel object and 
the animals were allowed to explore freely for 10 min. All objects were balanced in terms of physical complexity 
and were emotionally neutral. The open-field and the objects were cleaned by 70% alcohol after each session to 
avoid possible odorant cues. Preference index, i.e., the ratio of the amount of time spent exploring any one of the 
two items or the novel object over the total time spent exploring both objects, was used to measure recognition 
memory70.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. 
Total RNA was extracted from the left hippocampi of control and 
tDCS-mice using QIAzol Lysis reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA sample integ-
rity and concentrations were evaluated with the BioPhotometer plus (Eppendorf, Germany). Reverse transcrip-
tion reactions were performed on equal amounts of RNA (2 μg) with a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription 
kit (Applied Biosystems, USA).

Semiquantitative RT-PCR and quantitative Real-Time PCR. 
Semiquantitative PCR of the cDNA was 
performed using Taq Polymerase (Fischer) and primers described by Aid et al.23 (Supplementary Table 3). The 
values of the control samples were set to 1.0, and the others were expressed as fold changes relative to the controls. 
Analyses were performed in triplicate on the left hippocampi obtained from controls and tDCS-mice.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) amplifications were performed using Power SYBR® 
 Master Mix on 
AB7500 instrument (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The thermal cycling profile 
featured a pre-incubation step of 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 15 s), annealing 
(55–57 °C, 30 s), and elongation (72 °C, 20 s). Melting curves were subsequently generated by heating amplified 
products at 94 °C for 15 s, cooling to 50 °C for 30 s, followed by slow heating to 94 °C in increments of 0.5 °C. 
Melting-curve analyses confirmed that only single products had been amplified. The primer sequences coding the 
Bdnf exons I, IV and IX are shown in Supplementary Table 4. All data were normalized by reference to the ampli-
fication levels of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) gene; a reference dye was included in 
the SYBR master mix. The thresholds calculated by the software were used to calculate specific mRNA expression 
levels using the cycle-at-threshold (Ct) method, and all results are expressed as fold changes (compared to con-
trol) for each transcript, employing the 2-ΔΔCt approach.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as 
previously described with minor modifications69. Animals were sacrificed 24 h or 1 week after the end of the 
stimulation protocol (Fig. 1). Mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (80 mg/Kg, i.m.) and medetomi-
dine (1 mg/Kg, i.m.) and transcardially perfused with an oxygenated Ringer’s solution (pH: 7.3), followed by 4% 
freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH:7.4). The brain was post-fixed overnight at 4 °C, and 
then transferred to a solution of 30% sucrose in PBS for 2 days. Coronal brain sections (45-μm-thick) containing 
hippocampi were then cut with a vibratome (VT1000S) and floated in ice-cold PBS.
Left hippocampi were isolated under optic microscope and minced through a 10 ml-syringe with decreasing 
needle size (18 to 22 gauge). Tissue lysate was resuspended in 200 μl lysis buffer containing SDS (1%), Tris-HCl 
(50 mM, pH 8.1), and EDTA (10 mM) and sonicated on ice with six 10-s pulses with a 20-s interpulse interval. 
Sample debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were precleared by incubation with protein-G 
Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and supernatants were sub-
jected to immunoprecipitation. Two μg of specific antibody (anti-pCREBSer133, anti-acetyl histone H3K9 from 
Millipore, anti-CBP from Abcam) or control IgG were added overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were col-
lected by incubation with protein-G Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C and subjected to a series of seven sequen-
tial washes. Immune complexes were eluted from beads by vortexing in elution buffer (1% SDS and NaHCO3 
0.1 M; pH 8.0). NaCl was added (final concentration 0.33 M), and cross-linking was reversed by incubation over-
night at 65 °C. DNA fragments were purified by using the PCR DNA fragments purification kit (Geneaid). The 
primer sequences for promoter I were designed on the basis of mouse Bdnf structure described by Aid et al.23 
(Supplementary Table 2).
PCR conditions and cycle numbers were determined empirically and each PCR reaction was performed in 
triplicate. Data are expressed as percentage of input calculated by the “
Adjusted input value” method according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific ChIP Analysis). In particular to calculate the Adjusted 
input the Ct value of input was subtracted by 6.644 (i.e., log2 of 100). Next, the percent input of control and tDCS 
samples was calculated using the formula: 100*2^(Adjusted input – Ct(ChIP). In the same way, the percent input 
of IgG samples was calculated using the formula 100*2^(Adjusted input – Ct(IgG).
Semiquantitative PCR amplification of Bdnf regulatory sequences performed on chromatin immunocom-
plexes showed that tDCS induced enhancement of H3K9 acetylation at promoter I but not at promoters II, III, 
and IV, thus supporting specificity of tDCS effects (Supplementary Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 3; same 
samples used for ChIP assays showed in Fig. 5d).
Western Immunoblot. 
Total proteins were extracted from the left hippocampi of control and tDCS-mice 
sacrificed 2 h after stimulation, by using ice cold RIPA buffer (Pierce; 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 
1% DOC, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1 × 
 protease, phosphatase-1, and phosphatase-2 inhibitor cocktails 
[Sigma]). The lysate was centrifuged (20,000 × 
 g, 30 min, 4 °C), and a 5-μl aliquot of the supernatant was assayed 
to determine the protein concentration (microBCA kit, Pierce). SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer was added 
to the supernatant, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Protein lysates (40–60 μg) were loaded onto 
10% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels for electrophoretic separation. ColorburstTM Electrophoresis markers 
(Sigma) were used as molecular mass standards. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes 
at 100 V for 2 h at 4 °C in transfer buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol. 
Membranes were incubated for 1 h with blocking buffer (5% skim milk in TBST), and then incubated overnight at 
4 °C with primary antibodies directed against one of the following proteins: pCREBSer133; CREB; pGSK-3β 
Ser9; 
GSK-3β 
; panH3ac; NeuN; actin and tubulin (1:1,000). After three 10-min rinses in TBST, membranes were incu-
bated for 1 h at RT with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,500). The membranes were then washed, and 
the bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare, UK).
Protein expression was evaluated and documented by using UVItec Cambridge Alliance. Experiments were 
performed in triplicate.
Images of Western blots have been cropped for presentation and full-size images are shown in Supplementary 
Figs 5 and 8. Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 5.
Curcumin and ANA-12 administration. 
Curcumin (Sigma) was diluted in DMSO40 (i.e., vehicle). Mice 
received curcumin 50 mg/kg or vehicle via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Mice were randomly assigned to sham 
or tDCS-group. Curcumin or vehicle was given 24 h prior to tDCS or sham stimulation, soon before stimulation

and the following day (Fig. 7a). Two hours later some animals were engaged in: i) the habituation session of the 
NOR test; ii) the 1st training session of the MWM; iii) tissue explant for ELISA assay. A week after stimulation (i.e., 
6 days after the last curcumin injection) the other mice were used for: i) slice preparation for LTP recordings; ii) 
tissue explant for ELISA assay (Fig. 7a).
For experiment with ANA-12, mice were divided in two groups receiving sham stimulation or anodal tDCS 
and subjected to NOR or MWM tests. A volume of 10 μl/g body weight was i.p. injected for vehicle and ANA-
12 (0.5 mg/kg body weight) solutions43. TDCS was applied 24 h before the 1st day of either NOR or MWM test 
(Fig. 8a).
Mice subjected to the NOR test were further distributed into ANA-12 and vehicle-injected groups (1% DMSO 
dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution). ANA-12 was injected 4 h before and soon after the training day of the NOR test 
as well as 4 h before the test phase.
Animals subjected to the MWM received ANA-12 injection 4 h before: i) each of the 4 training sessions and 
ii) the probe test session.
With regard to behavioral tests, given that statistical analysis revealed no significant effect of vehicle adminis-
tration on the NOR test (P = 
 1 vs. naïve, unpaired Student’s t-test), we enrolled in the MWM test only two groups 
of animals, including tDCS-mice and sham-stimulated mice all injected with curcumin or ANA-12.
ELISA measurements. 
Brain tissues were obtained as described for Western blot and stored at − 
80 °C. 
Prior to analysis, samples were thawed and then weighed. Lysis buffer (100 mM PIPES pH 7, 500 mM NaCl, 
0.2% Triton X-100, 2% BSA, 2 mM EDTA, 200 μM PMSF, 1 × 
 protease, phosphatase-1, and phosphatase-2 inhib-
itor cocktails from Sigma) was then pipetted into each tube (100 μl per mg of tissue for each left hippocam-
pus). Samples were homogenized, sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × 
 g at 4 °C. Supernatants were 
then removed and frozen at − 
80 °C until analysis. The concentration of Bdnf was determined using the E-Max 
ImmunoAssay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis. 
Sample sizes were chosen with adequate statistical power (0.8) according to results of 
prior pilot data sets or studies, including our own, that used similar methods or paradigms. Sample estimation 
and statistical analysis were performed using the SigmaPlot 12 software. Data were first tested for equal variance 
and normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and then the appropriate statistical tests were chosen. The statistical tests used 
(i.e., Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, two-way RM ANOVA) are indi-
cated in the main text and in the corresponding figure legends for each experiment. Post-hoc multiple compari-
sons were performed with Bonferroni correction.
All statistical tests were two-tailed and the level of significance was set at 0.05. Results are presented as 
mean ± 
 s.e.m. In the graphs, y-axis error bars represent s.e.m. Analyses were performed in blind.
Criteria of animal exclusion/inclusion were pre-established according to Ethics Committee guidelines but no 
data were excluded from analysis.
