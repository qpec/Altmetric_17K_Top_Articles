Curcumin (1,7-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5dione) is a polyphenol extracted 
from turmeric that has long been advocated for the treatment of a variety of conditions including 
neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders. Despite this promise, the clinical use of curcumin has 
been limited by the poor solubility and low bioavailability of this molecule. In this article, we describe a 
novel nanocarrier formulation comprising Pluronic-F127 stabilised D-α
-Tocopherol polyethene glycol 
1000 succinate nanoparticles, which were used to successfully solubilize high concentrations (4.3 mg/
mL) of curcumin. Characterisation with x-ray diffraction and in vitro release assays localise curcumin to 
the nanocarrier interior, with each particle measuring <20 nm diameter. Curcumin-loaded nanocarriers 
(CN) were found to significantly protect against cobalt chloride induced hypoxia and glutamate 
induced toxicity in vitro, with CN treatment significantly increasing R28 cell viability. Using established 
glaucoma-related in vivo models of ocular hypertension (OHT) and partial optic nerve transection 
(pONT), topical application of CN twice-daily for three weeks significantly reduced retinal ganglion cell 
loss compared to controls. Collectively, these results suggest that our novel topical CN formulation has 
potential as an effective neuroprotective therapy in glaucoma and other eye diseases with neuronal 
pathology.
Glaucoma describes a distinctive group of progressive optic neuropathies affecting over 60 million people world-
wide and responsible for 8.4 million cases of irreversible blindness1. Although several mechanisms have been 
proposed, glaucoma principally involves the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)2. Elevated intraocular pressure 
(IOP) today presents the only clinically modifiable risk factor for glaucoma progression3, however, many patients 
continue to lose visual field despite well controlled IOP4. Due to the limited effectiveness and indirect nature of 
IOP modulating therapy, the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of glaucoma inde-
pendent of IOP modulation is now sought5.
RGC apoptosis has been identified as an early event in glaucomatous degeneration and the inhibition of this 
process has been advocated as a therapeutic strategy5,6. For example, in addition to the well-established IOP 
modulatory effects of brimonidine7, this third generation α
2 adrenergic agonist is also reported to possess an 
additional neuroprotective activity in rodent models of glaucoma8. Although the mechanism of action remains 
to be fully described, there is emerging clinical evidence to suggest that topical brimonidine therapy exhibits an 
RGC preserving activity over and above IOP modulating effects in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma9.
Curcumin (1,7-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5dione) is a polyphenol extracted from 
turmeric (Curcuma longa)10 reported to modulate a range of biochemical processes implicated in neurodegen-
erative disorders11. For example, curcumin has been found to attenuate pathways implicated in the pathogenesis 
of the most common ophthalmic disorders12–19, including: mitochondrial-mediated oxidative stress20, inflam-
matory responses via PPAR-γ
 agonist activity21, down-regulation of COX-2 and iNOS22, downregulation of 
JAK2-STAT3 mediated astrogliosis23, β
-amyloid aggregation24, and anti-angiogenic activity via modulation of 
the VEGF/VEGFR/K-ras pathway25. Supplementing rodent diets with 0.01% to 0.25% curcumin has previously 
been reported to protect RGCs and microvasculature against ischemia/reperfusion injury via inhibition of Nf-κ
B, 
STAT3 and MCP-1 overexpression26. More recently, intragastric administration of curcumin (10 mg/kg/day) for 
6 weeks in a rodent model of ocular hypertension was reported to result in a significant reduction in retinal

microglial death27. This equates to a typical human dose of 800 mg/day which has previously been associated with 
adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhoea in addition to an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and lactate 
dehydrogenase levels28. Despite the therapeutic potential of curcumin in ophthalmology, however, several key 
challenges have limited the clinical applicability of this agent including its poor water solubility (~11 ng/mL)29  
and low bioavailability10,30. Single oral administration of between 2 g and 12 g of curcumin in humans yields 
peak serum concentrations of less than 50 ng/mL31,32 and repeated administration of gram doses (0.4 g to 12 g) 
yields variable peak plasma concentrations typically less than 1 µg/mL, with no accumulation after repeated 
daily administration for up to 3 months28,33,34. The number of capsules each patient was required to take (up to 
24 ×
 500 mg capsules per day) and mild gastrointestinal side-effects precluded higher oral dosing of curcumin in 
this form.
For treatment of ophthalmic disorders, topical administration is the preferred delivery route as it permits 
self-administration and localises dosing to ocular tissues, minimising the risk of side effects associated with sys-
temic absorption. Local dosing also offers a method to overcome the extremely low systemic bioavailability, rapid 
metabolic degradation and clearance of this agent35. For instance, in mice only trace amounts (0.41 µg/g) of cur-
cumin are reported to reach the CNS after systemic administration36. As typically less than 3% of topically applied 
small drugs are reported to reach posterior ocular tissues37, the extremely limited water solubility of curcumin 
has been a challenge for the topical administration of this drug. Methods to enhance the solubility of curcumin 
include; prior solubilization in an alkaline buffer (typically 0.5 M sodium hydroxide), dissolution in solvents such 
as DMSO or incorporation into nanocarriers38–44. Solvents such as DMSO are commonly used to dissolve poorly 
soluble drug candidates for preclinical investigation, however, the toxicity of this agent, even at low concentra-
tions, is increasingly recognised45. Furthermore, dissolution of curcumin in DMSO or alkaline are unsuitable 
for in vitro and in vivo applications without further dilution into physiological buffers, and subsequent dilution 
of these curcumin solutions into aqueous buffers at physiological pH, are frequently unstable and result in rapid 
precipitation46.
To overcome these limitations, nanotechnology approaches can be used to provide hydrophobic environ-
ments for poorly soluble drug molecules which persist in a stable aqueous suspension. Further advantages of this 
approach include nanoparticle-mediated protection of encapsulated drug cargo from hydrolytic or enzymatic 
degradation and enhanced transport across biological barriers47. D-α
-tocopherol polyethene glycol 1000 succi-
nate (TPGS) is a non-ionic surfactant that forms stable micelles at concentrations of greater than 0.02% w/w48. 
TPGS is considered a safe pharmaceutic adjuvant by the FDA, which coupled with the observation that this 
agent can inhibit P-glycoprotein activity49 has led to the widespread use of this agent in drug delivery systems50. 
In this study, TPGS was combine with Pluronic F127, a difunctional block copolymer surfactant consisting of a 
central hydrophobic polyoxypropylene group flanked by hydrophilic polyoxyethylene groups. Pluronic F127 has 
previously been used to sterically stabilise nanocarriers against aggregation51. This, combined with the thermo-
responsive properties and high biocompatibility of this polymer, has led to it being widely used for ophthalmic 
drug delivery applications52,53.
The aim of the present study was to develop a curcumin nanocarrier comprising TPGS and Pluronic F127 
suitable for use as a topical formulation in the treatment of eye diseases. We describe the development of a novel 
CN formulation of curcumin solubilizing up to 4.5 mg/mL of curcumin with an encapsulation efficiency exceed-
ing 95%, average particle size <20 nm and good stability for over two months when stored at 25 °C in liquid or 
lyophilized forms. The neuroprotective potential of this formulation is then assessed in the immortalised R28 
retinal precursor cell line54 subject to insults that have previously been suggested to model aspects of the retinal 
environment in glaucoma. These include; cobalt chloride (hypoxia mimetic)55 and glutamate induced toxicity56. 
Finally, this formulation was shown to be effective as an eye-drop in reducing RGC loss in two well-established 
rodent models of optic nerve disease, ocular hypertension (OHT) and partial optic nerve transection (pONT) 
models57.
Results and Discussion
Spectroscopic methods can be used to assess curcumin encapsulation efficiency and oxidation 
state. 
On dilution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) curcumin had an absorbance peak at 435 nm (Fig. 1C) and 
molar extinction coefficient (Fig. 1D,E) of 58547 L.mol−
1.cm−
1, comparable to previously reported values58. The 
absorbance of curcumin diluted in DMSO at 435 nm obeyed Beer-Lambert’s law up to 42 µM and TPGS/Pluronic 
F127 nanocarriers in the absence of curcumin had no measurable absorbance at this wavelength. Spectroscopic 
assessment was used to determine the encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of curcumin-containing formulations after 
separation of unencapsulated material by 0.22 µm filtration. Spectroscopic measurements of EE% were confirmed 
using an established HPLC technique (Fig. 1F) with both techniques showed good agreement (4.31 ± 0.18 mg/mL 
versus 4.32 ± 0.33 mg/mL respectively).
Spectroscopic determination of curcumin concentration in nanocarriers can also be used to give indication 
of the extent of curcumin degradation. Curcumin undergoes keto-enol tautomerization (Fig. 1A), existing in the 
more stable keto form under acidic or neutral conditions and the more water soluble enol-form under alkaline 
conditions. In common with other molecules that undergo keto-enol tautomerization59, the enol form of cur-
cumin is more prone to hydrolytic degradation60. Acceleration of curcumin degradation processes by dissolution 
in an alkaline buffer58, gave rise to a dramatically reduced curcumin molar extinction coefficient at 435 nm com-
pared to formulated curcumin (Fig. 1C,D, 2133 L.mol−
1.cm−
1 after 72 h incubation in the presence of 1 M sodium 
hydroxide solution). Furthermore, incubation of CNs in alkaline conditions induced a dramatic colour change 
from orange to brown (Fig. 1E). Spectroscopic assessment of curcumin concentration after dissolution in sodium 
hydroxide indicates that the curcumin molar extinction coefficient rapidly diminished, suggesting that this tech-
nique can not only be used to assess curcumin entrapment efficiency but also be used to monitor the extent of 
degradation of curcumin containing formulations.

TPGS/Pluronic F127 nanocarriers enhance curcumin solubility and stability. 
Initially, curcumin 
loaded nanocarriers were prepared by incorporation it into TPGS nanocarriers. TPGS was chosen due to the 
low critical micelle concentration of this excipient (0.02% w/w)48, the endogenous nature and antioxidant prop-
erties of the α
-tocopherol component61 and P-glycoprotein antagonism49, which enhances the barrier crossing 
ability of formulations containing this agent62. TPGS is present in existing ophthalmic formulations62 and both 
curcumin and TPGS can be readily solubilized in ethanol, a solvent which is present at concentrations of 0.8% 
in commercially available eye drop formulations (i.e. Optrex ActiMist 2in1 Eye Spray for Dry Irritated Eyes) so 
reducing risks associated with residual solvents from the manufacturing process. Furthermore, as the use of TPGS 
to enhance the bioavailability of orally administered drugs is well documented60. This, in combination with recent 
interest in the use of Pluronic F127 food-research applications63 may suggest that the novel curcumin formulation 
described herein may also be suitable for oral administration.
Formulation of curcumin with TPGS micelles was found to produce nanocarriers with 16 nm diameter as 
determined by dynamic light scattering (data not shown). Unfortunately, these formulations rapidly aggregated 
at 25 °C, resulting in the formation of sediment within hours of resuspension which may be indicative of Ostwald 
ripening processes64. Stabilisation of curcumin loaded TPGS nanocarriers was achieved by the addition of the 
polymeric stabiliser Pluronic F127 (a triblock copolymer of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene), which has 
previously been used to sterically stabilise nanocarriers against aggregation51.
Curcumin-loaded nanocarriers (CN) were prepared according to the methods described, with encapsulation 
efficiency and average particle size determined (Fig. 2). On resuspension in PBS (pH 7.4) or HEPES trehalose 
buffer (pH 7.4), nanocarriers were found to encapsulate 96.0% ± 2.0% (4.32 mg/mL) and 94.2% ± 4.1% (4.31 mg/
mL) of curcumin respectively. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that nanocarriers were typically 20 nm 
in diameter and of uniform size (Fig. 2A). These results were confirmed by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 2B,C) 
which identified a homogeneous particle dispersion with a z-average diameter between 16 and 20 nm suggestive 
of a micellar formulation.
The encapsulation efficiency and particle size of CN formulations were assessed over time after storage at 25 °C 
while protecting from light. The CN formulation was found to exhibit excellent stability for 9 weeks at 25 °C, with 
no reduction in formulation EE% (Fig. 2E), significant change in particle diameter (Fig. 2F) or dispersity (Fig. 2G) 
over this time. This stability study was repeated using lyophilised CNs prepared in the same buffer before stor-
ing at 25 °C while protecting from light. The residual water content calculated at 120 °C was 1.085 ± 0.050%, 
indicating lyophilized formulations were properly prepared. Formulations were resuspended prior to recording

dispersion properties (Fig. 2E,G) which were found to remain constant and similar to those reported for liq-
uid formulations (Table 1). EE% was found to decline by an average of 20% versus baseline at each time point 
assessed, suggesting this may be a result of the lyophilization or rehydration process.

Several groups have previously attempted to prepare curcumin loaded nanoparticle formulations, includ-
ing; PLGA-nanocarriers38,39, solid lipid nanocarriers40,41, liposomes42,43 and exosomes44. Existing nanoparticulate 
formulations of curcumin possess limited stability (not assessed beyond 72 h in any study cited), only moderate 
curcumin loading has been achieved (<0.77 mg/mL)38 and most protocols would be difficult to translate to the 
clinic owing to complex, multi-step manufacture protocols requiring organic solvents. The TPGS/Pluronic F127 
curcumin formulation described here compares favourably with those in the existing literature.
XRD and FT-IR spectra were acquired to ascertain the nature of curcumin once incorporated into nanocar-
riers (Fig. 3). The X-ray diffraction patterns of free curcumin exhibited characteristic peaks between 5° and 30°, 
indicative of a highly crystalline structure65. This character was lost on inclusion of curcumin in a nanocarrier 
formulation, indicating that curcumin has successfully been incorporated into the amorphous nanocarrier struc-
ture and is not associated with the particle surface66. FT-IR spectra reveal characteristic peaks of free curcumin at 
3509 cm−
1, 1626 cm−
1, 1601 cm−
1, 1505 cm−
1, 1271 cm−
1, 1024 cm−
1, 948 cm−
1 and 713 cm−
1 which closely match 
previously reported values67. On incorporation into nanocarriers, the characteristic curcumin peak at 3509 cm−
1 
(indicative of the free hydroxyl group) merged with the broad OH peak of the TPGS/Pluronic F127 carrier at 
3352 cm−
1, which may suggest complex formation68. Furthermore, characteristics shifts in the aromatic C=C 
peak (1601 cm−
1 to 1588 cm−
1) and the C=O stretching, δ
(CCC) and δ
(CCO) in plane bending from 1505 cm−
1 
to 1514 cm−
1 have previously been interpreted as evidence for the successful incorporation of curcumin into a 
complex68.
Formulation of curcumin into nanocarriers substantially reduced the rate of drug release compared to free 
drug (t1/2 = 22.6 h versus 0.15 h respectively, Fig. 4) at 37 °C, attributed to the slow rate of release of curcumin 
from nanocarriers. Less than 10% of the drug was liberated after 5 h of incubation, suggesting that there was little 
burst release from the CN formulation. This observation supports FT-IR and XRD observations that curcumin is 
not merely associated with the nanocarrier surface but is localised within the hydrophobic interior in an amor-
phous or disordered crystalline phase, in agreement with previous work41. Together, these results suggest that the 
curcumin-loaded nanocarrier formulation described in this study have sustained release capability.
Curcumin-loaded nanocarriers protect a retinal cell line against glutamate and hypoxia-induced 
injury. 
Glutamate excitotoxicity represents a potential mechanism leading to RGC loss in glaucoma69,70. Using 
an AlamarBlue cell viability assay, co-incubation of immortalised R28 cells with both CNs and empty nanoparti-
cles was found to be significantly protective (one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test, p < 0.001) against glutamate 
induced toxicity (Fig. 5A and B, IC50 28.3 ± 3.4 mM versus 5.9 ± 1.2 mM for EM and insult only treated groups 
respectively, on-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test p < 0.001) with no additive effect observed on addition of cur-
cumin to the nanoparticles (24.5 ± 1.2 mM, CN containing 20 µM curcumin). This observation is in agreement 
with previous studies that suggest α
-tocopherol (here present in the form of TPGS) is protective against glutamate 
induced toxicity and this has been suggested to be a result of the anti-oxidant function of this molecule71,72. As 
TPGS was not also protective against cobalt chloride induced insult, this suggests curcumin and TPGS may have 
additive therapeutic effects.

in aqueous buffers, the release of curcumin from ethanoic solutions was limited by the formation of a visible

curcumin.

Upregulation of hypoxia-related factors such as Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α
 (HIF-1α
) has been suggested 
to implicate hypoxia in glaucoma pathology73,74. Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) is a hypoxia mimetic and inducer of 
HIF-1α
75 used as an in vitro glaucoma model76. The IC50 of R28 cells exposed to CoCl2 for 24 h (Fig. 5C,D) 
was found to be significantly increased on concurrent incubation with 20 µM curcumin in the form of CN 
(296 ± 53 µM vs 757 ± 51 µM respectively, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test, p < 0.001). Treatment with an 
equivalent concentration of the nanoparticle in the absence of curcumin had no significant effect (296 ± 53 µM 
versus 354 ± 8 µM, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test, p > 0.05) suggesting that the protective effects 
observed were as a result of curcumin. Concentrations of curcumin <20 µM were not found to be neuroprotec-
tive in this model. Curcumin has previously been reported to inhibit HIF-1α
 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells77 
and was more recently reported to supresses HIF-1α
 synthesis in pituitary adenomas78. HIF-1α
 inhibitors have 
previously been proposed as potential glaucoma treatment worthy of further investigation79.
Topically administered curcumin nanocarrier therapy protects RGCs in rodent models of ocular 
hypertension and optic nerve injury. 
Having established the neuroprotective activity of CNs in vitro 
in relation to vehicle only treatments, we next assessed the neuroprotective effects of this formulation on RGC 
health using an established in vivo rodent model of RGC loss. We anticipate that topically applied curcumin 
loaded nanoparticles will reach the retina via a combination of topical and systemic absorption routes. In sup-
port of this hypothesis, Sigurdsson et al. reported that their formulation of dexamethasone, which is a similar 
molecular weight to curcumin (392 versus 368 Da respectively), entered the retina 60% via topical penetration 
and 40% by systemic absorption route80. We anticipate that the well-documented P-gp inhibition activity of toco-
pherols49,81 and curcumin82, in conjunction with enhanced corneal penetration activity previously reported for 
PEGylated-micelle formulations83 will enhance curcumin delivery to the retina by the topical absorption route.
Optimum time points post model induction (maximal RGC loss in shortest time after induction) were chosen 
based on our previous work characterising the natural history of the OHT and pONT models where multiple 
time points were assessed after model induction57. We recently reported that administration of TPGS containing 
micelles did not themselves have a neuroprotective effect in vivo81, which in conjunction with our in vitro obser-
vations, suggest that any neuroprotective efficacy observed was a result of curcumin treatment. Rats received 
topical CNs according to the dosing regimen illustrated in Fig. 6A. Briefly, two days prior to OHT model induc-
tion, rodents began receiving two drops (35 µL each) of CNs dosed five minutes apart per day for three weeks 
from the date of model induction. Topical administration of CNs was found to be well-tolerated by rats with no 
signs of ocular irritation or inflammation reported in naive eyes monitored by a qualified ophthalmologist. The

Schematic of in-vivo experimental design. OHT rats were randomised to no treatment or once-daily curcumin 
nanoparticles (CN) or free Curcumin (FC) eye-drops, beginning two days prior to elevated IOP induction. 
Three-weeks after surgery, animals were sacrificed and retinas flat mounted before labelling with Brn3a. RGC 
populations were counted as previously described57,94. Representative retinal images of comparable Brn3a 
labelled areas of superior retina are shown in (B) Naïve control, (C) OHT untreated and (D) OHT + CN 
animals. (E) All OHT animals had significantly raised IOP (mean ± SE) versus baseline until 21 days after 
surgery (Student T-test versus contralateral eyes **p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in IOP 
between OHT treatment groups at any time point suggesting any neuroprotective activity observed was IOP 
independent. (F) Elevated IOP in OHT only eyes was associated with a significant reduction in RGC density 
(~23%) in agreement with previous studies57; CN but not FC treatment, significantly reduced RGC loss 
(Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunns post test, **p < 0.01).

IOP profile of rodent’s after IOP elevation by injection of hypertonic saline into two episcleral veins (Fig. 6B) 
indicates that IOP remained significantly elevated for at least 7 days after model induction versus naive eyes. No 
significant difference in IOP profile between CN and OHT only groups was observed, suggesting that any neu-
roprotective effect of curcumin was due to IOP independent processes. RGC health was assessed histologically 
from whole-retinal mounts using brn3a assessment (Fig. 6C). This approach was chosen as Brn3a is a nuclear 
restricted and RGC specific transcription factor that exclusively label 97% of the RGC population (excluding 
photosensitive RGCs)84. We have also recently developed an algorithm to accurately and automatically quantify 
whole RGC populations in rodent models of retinopathy enabling the reliable assessment of RGC health57. Using 
this approach, OHT induction was found to result in a significant reduction in global RGC density of ~23% com-
pared to contralateral eyes, which is comparable to previous studies using this model57. CN administration sig-
nificantly improved the RGC density ratio between OHT eye vs contralateral untreated eyes (Kruskal-Wallis test 
with Dunns post test, **p < 0.01), whereas administration of un-encapsulated curcumin (FC - free curcumin) 
solubilised in PBS did not have this effect (Fig. 6D–F).
To further investigate the neuroprotective potential of topically applied CNs, whole-retinal brn3a labelled 
RGC population assessments were made in the pONT model (Fig. 7A). In this model, twice-daily topical admin-
istration of CNs was found be significantly protect RGCs (one-way ANOVA, ***p < 0.001). On subdivision 
of whole retinal mounts into superior and inferior quadrants (Fig. 7B), treatment with CNs was observed to 
result in preservation of RGC populations in both the superior and inferior quadrants, but this effect was more 
pronounced in the superior retina (two-way ANOVA, ***p < 0.001), which may imply the protective effects 
of curcumin therapy exert through anti-apoptotic as well as anti-oxidant mechanisms. Representative regions 
from the superior quadrant of Brn3a labelled retinal whole-mounts (Fig. 7C–E) illustrate RGC populations

indicate that while pONT caused a significant reduction in RGC density, this was reduced by daily 
administration of CN (one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.0001). (E) Further 
segmentation of the each retina into superior and inferior quadrants using the method described previously57 
demonstrates that topical CN prevent some RGC density loss in both the superior and inferior retina (two-way 
ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests ***p < 0.001).

were diminished in retina subject pONT (Fig. 7D) versus naive controls (Fig. 7C). Treatment with CNs for three 
weeks was found to protect RGC soma from pONT induced injury (Fig. 7E). As preservation of RGC soma was 
observed in both the superior and inferior retinal quadrants, this suggests that curcumin may elicit neuroprotec-
tive activity via multiple pathways involving both primary and secondary neurodegeneration processes.
The possibility of TPGS mediated neuroprotection via inhibition of glutamate excitotoxicity is intriguing and 
may contribute to the neuroprotective effect of our formulation in vivo. In support of this hypothesis and our 
present in vitro findings, Nucci et al.85 previously reported that intraocular administration of a total of 10 µL of 
0.5% (w/v) TPGS (equivalent to a total dose of 0.5 mg TPGS) was neuroprotective against ischemia/reperfusion 
injury in the rat. Previously, we reported that topical administration of TPGS at the same concentration did not 
have a neuroprotective effect in vivo81. This discrepancy is likely to the lower concentration reaching the retina 
compared to invasive application, typically estimated to be ~3% of the topically applied dose37. Although our pre-
vious work with this model suggests that administration of TPGS only did not appear to have a neuroprotective 
effect in its own right, a synergism between curcumin and TPGS is extremely likely, if not via the neuroprotective 
effects of TPGS alone, then perhaps via TPGS mediated modulation of P-gp activity, enhancing curcumin trans-
port across ocular barriers49,81.
The neuroprotective effect of curcumin loaded nanocarriers observed in this study may be a result of treat-
ment commencing two days before model induction, suggesting this therapy may be most effective for patients 
at risk of IOP spikes such as following phacoemulsification surgery86 or as a prophylactic to patients identified 
at high risk of developing glaucoma such as those with ocular hypertension or other glaucoma risk factors2. 
Furthermore, with the development of new techniques such as DARC (detection of apoptotic retinal cells) with 
the potential to diagnose glaucoma earlier in the disease process87, therapies to slow or prevent RGC loss at earlier 
stages of disease progression will play a greater role in glaucoma management.
In conclusion, this study describes a novel nanocarrier formulation of curcumin in TPGS/Pluronic F127 that 
increases the solubility of this poorly soluble drug by a factor of almost 400,000. This formulation incorporates 
4.3 mg/mL of curcumin with an encapsulation efficiency consistently >90% and excellent stability in liquid or 
lyophilized forms for at least two months when stored at room temperature, as determined by HPLC and spec-
troscopic techniques. This formulation was found to be neuroprotective against glutamate and cobalt chloride 
induced injury in retinal cultures in vitro and significantly preserved RGC density in two well-established rodent 
models of ocular injury. In conclusion, we demonstrate that curcumin loaded nanoparticles have exciting poten-
tial for overcoming ocular barriers and may facilitate the translation of curcumin based therapies to the clinic for 
the treatment of ocular conditions such as glaucoma.
Methods and Materials
Preparation of curcumin loaded nanocarriers. 
Curcumin, D-α
-tocopherol polyethene glycol 1000 suc-
cinate (TPGS) and Pluronic F127 were obtained at the highest available purity from Sigma-Aldrich (Kent, UK). 
Curcumin-loaded nanocarriers (CN) were prepared using an adaptation of the thin-film hydration technique 
described previously88. Curcumin, TPGS, and Pluronic F127 were dissolved in ethanol to a concentration of 
5 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL respectively; with 10 min of gentle heating and bath ultrasonication to clar-
ity. Solutions were aliquoted in the desired molar ratio (22.55 mM, 12.22 mM 7.94 mM of TPGS, curcumin, and 
Pluronic F127 respectively) into a round bottom flask, mixing well. The solvent was removed by rotary evapo-
ration (50 mBar, 65 °C, 2 h) using a Rotavapor R210 with a V850 Vacuum controller (Buchi, Switzerland) while 
protecting from light. After this time, the thin-film was rehydrated (50 °C, 0.5 h) in the desired buffer (distilled 
water, phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) or HEPES trehalose buffer (10 mM HEPES, 50 mg/mL trehalose, pH 
7.4). Unencapsulated curcumin was then removed from the formulation by 0.22 µm filtration (33 mm Millex fil-
ter, Merck Millipore, USA) as shown in Fig. 1B. Free-curcumin (FC) was prepared according to the same protocol 
as described above, without the addition of TPGS or Pluronic F127.
Lyophilisation of curcumin loaded nanocarriers. 
Lyophilisation of CN formulations in HEPES treha-
lose buffer was achieved by equilibrating 1 mL aliquots of nanocarriers in 7 mL screw neck squat form glass vials 
(CamLab, Cambridge UK) at 25 °C before freezing at −
60 °C for 2 h at 760 Torr. Primary drying of samples was 
completed at −
38 °C at 200 mTorr for 24 h, followed by a secondary drying phase at 25 °C and 200 mTorr for 2 h. 
Samples were capped immediately after cessation of secondary drying before storing at 25 °C while protecting 
from light until required. For stability assessment, samples were rehydrated for 30 minutes by addition of 1 mL of 
0.22 µm filtered distilled water with gentle mixing.
The moisture content of formulations was determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Freeze dry 
samples were placed in an aluminium pan and analysed by a Discovery TGA (TA instruments, USA). Samples 
were purged with a flow rate of 25 mL/min nitrogen gas and heated from 30 to 200 °C with 10 °C/min rate. The 
percent mass loss was calculated by TA Instruments Trios software at 120 °C for water content. Three freeze dry 
formulations were measured three times for each sample.
Curcumin loading efficiency. 
The loading efficiency of CNs was determined spectroscopically and results 
confirmed using HPLC. Spectroscopic determination of curcumin loading was achieved by diluting in DMSO 
1:500 at 435 nm normalised to empty nanocarriers. The concentration of curcumin in each formulation was then 
determined using the molar extinction coefficient of curcumin (Fig. 1) determined by constructing a standard 
curve measuring the absorbance of known curcumin concentrations. The encapsulation efficiency of each for-
mulation was calculated using Eq. 1;

where [C]S is the concentration of curcumin originally added to the formulation (typically 4.5 mg/mL) and 
[C]E is the concentration of curcumin detected spectroscopically within the nanocarriers after 0.22 µm filtra-
tion to remove unencapsulated material. Results were confirmed using an adaptation of an established HPLC 
technique89. Briefly, curcumin containing samples were diluted in methanol before 20 µL volumes were injected 
at 25 °C onto a Phenomenex® Synergi (4 µm Polar—RP 80 A with size of 250 ×
 4.60 mm) column with an 
Acetonitrile: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 50:50 solvent system at a flow rate of 1 mL/min connected to a Agilent 
Technology 1260 Infinity HPLC system. Absorbance was recorded at 420 nm and the area under the curcumin 
elution curve compared to a standard curve of known curcumin concentrations.
Dynamic light scattering. 
Particle size was determined using a Malvern Zetasizer. Measurements of parti-
cle diameter and polydispersity index were recorded from a minimum of three formulations for each experimen-
tal condition or time point after manufacture. Nanocarriers were diluted 1 in 10 in the appropriate buffer prior 
to recording.
Transmission electron microscopy. 
Nanocarrier suspensions were processed using carbon grids to 
absorb particles from suspension before staining with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min and drying. Specimens were 
observed using a Joel-1010 Transition Electron Microscope operated at 100 kV with images acquired using a 
Gatan Orius digital camera.
X-ray diffraction and FT-IR. 
X-ray diffraction graphs of drug alone, empty nanoparticles or CN were pre-
pared from X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku MiniFlex 600) and the 2-thea angle was set from 5° to 65° with an angu-
lar increment of 0.05°/second. The measurements were performed at a voltage of 40 kV and 15 mA. The FT-IR 
spectrum of free curcumin, empty nanoparticles and CN were recorded using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR 
spectrometer at 4 cm−
1 resolution, with 4 scans between 4000 cm−
1 and 650 cm−
1.
Curcumin release assay. 
In vitro curcumin release was assessed using an adaptation of a previously 
described protocol41. Briefly, free curcumin (dissolved in 95% ethanol) or CNs containing 4.5 mg/mL of curcumin 
was loaded into a 1 mL Spectra-Por Float-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Sigma-Aldrich) with 3.5–5 kDa molecular 
weight cut-off. Samples were dialysed against 200 mL of PBS containing 10% Tween-80 to act as a sink for released 
curcumin maintained at 37 °C with stirring at 50 rpm. At the specified time points, samples were removed from 
the mixture and replaced with fresh buffer. The concentration of curcumin was determined as described above. 
Results from three experimental replicates were fit to a single phase association (Eq. 2);

where Y0 = zero, Plateau is the maximal release and K is the rate of curcumin release (h−

Cell culture. 
R28 cell line (Kerafast, Boston, MA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(DMEM; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, UK), 100 U/ml pen-
icillin, 100 μ
g/ml of streptomycin and 0.292 mg/mL glutamine (Gibco, UK), 7.5% sterile dH20 and 1.5 mM KCl 
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK). The medium was changed every other day and cultures were passaged at 90% confluence.
Cell viability assessment. 
R28 cells were plated at 4,000 cells/well in 96-well plates for 24 h before treat-
ment with varying concentrations of curcumin (0 to 20 µM) or an equivalent concentration of TPGS/Pluronic 
F127 only nanocarriers (vehicle control) in conjunction with varying concentrations of cobalt chloride or glu-
tamate insults for a further 24 h. Cell viability was assessed in each case using the Alamarblue (Invitrogen, UK) 
assay according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the Alamarblue solution was added to each well-plate 
and incubated for 4 hours before recording the fluorescence using a Safire plate reader excitation of 530 nm and 
emission of 590 nm90.
Animals. 
All animal experiments were performed with procedures approved by the U.K. Home Office and 
in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. For in vivo 
assessment of experiments: in total 48 Adult male Dark Agouti (DA) rats (Harlan Laboratories, UK) weighing 150 
to 200 g were housed in an air-conditioned, 21 °C environment with a 12 h light-dark cycle (140–260 lux), where 
food and water were available ad libitum. 13 animals served as naïve controls which were not subject to further 
interventions before immunohistochemistry.
Ocular hypertension (OHT) model. 
Ocular hypertension was surgically induced in the left eye of 18 DA 
rats (5 OHT only, 5 OHT + CN, 8 OHT + FC) as described previously91. Procedures were conducted under gen-
eral anaesthesia using a mixture of 37.5% Ketamine (Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA), 25% Dormitol (Pfizer 
Animal Health, Exton, PA) and 37.5% sterile water, at 2 mL/kg administered intraperitoneally. Briefly, 50 µL of 
hypertonic saline solution (1.8 M) was injected into the two episcleral veins using a syringe pump (50 µL/min; 
UMP2; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA). A propylene ring with a 1 mm gap cut from the circum-
ference was placed around the equator to prevent injected saline outflow from other aqueous veins. The IOP from 
both eyes of each rat was measured at regular intervals using a TonoLab tonometer (Tiolat Oy, Helsinki, Finland) 
under inhalational anaesthesia (0.4% isoflurane in oxygen). Daily administration of topical CNs was performed

in 5 DA rats (two 35 µL drops/day 5 min apart at 10 am each day) starting two days prior to model induction 
and continuing until model termination (21 days post IOP elevation) with 5 rats serving as OHT only controls. 
An additional 8 rats received free-curcumin (FC) prepared using the same protocol as CN curcumin without 
the addition of TPGS or Pluronic F127. FC was administered to OHT animals using the same dosing regime as 
described for CN. Animals were sacrificed three weeks after unilateral IOP elevation and retinas flat-mounted 
prior to Brn3a immunohistochemistry.
Partial optic nerve transection (PONT) model. 
Partial optic nerve transection was conducted in the left 
eye of 17 DA rats, using a previously described technique92. Under general anaesthesia, an incision was made in 
the superior conjunctiva, and the ON sheath was exposed. A longitudinal slit was next formed in the dura mater 
to expose the ON and a 0.2-mm cut was made in the dorsal ON, 2 mm behind the eye using an ophthalmic scalpel 
with steel cutting guard. Damage to major ophthalmic blood vessels was avoided and verified at the completion 
of surgery by ophthalmoscopy. Daily administration of topical CNs was conducted in 9 DA rats after induction 
of the pONT model using the same treatment regimen as described previously with the remaining 8 serving as 
pONT only controls.
Brn-3a immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. 
Brn-3a labelling of RGCs in retinal 
whole-mounts was completed as described previously57. Briefly, eyes were enucleated upon sacrifice and fixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight before dissecting retinal whole mounts. Whole mounts were stained 
for the RGC specific nuclear-localised transcription factor Brn3a using an anti-mouse mAb (1:500, Merck 
Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and examined under confocal microscopy (LSM 710, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging 
GmbH, Jena, Germany). Each retinal whole mount was imaged as a tiled z-stack at x10 magnification which was 
used to generate a single plane maximum projection of the RGC layer in each retina for subsequent analysis. 
Each whole mount image was manually orientated so that the superior retina was towards the top of the image 
using in vivo cSLO imaging of retinal vasculature as a reference. Retinal image acquisition settings were kept 
constant for all retinas imaged, allowing comparison of Brn3a expression in each experimental group as previ-
ously described93. Automated quantification of Brn3a labelled RGCs in retinal whole-mounts was completed as 
described previously57.
Statistical Analysis. 
All data were analysed with the Student’s t-test, ANOVA or with appropriate post hoc 
testing using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) as appropriate. Data were presented 
as means ± SE and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Molecular structures were drawn using ACD/ChemSketch 
2015 and all images were taken by the authors (BMD).
