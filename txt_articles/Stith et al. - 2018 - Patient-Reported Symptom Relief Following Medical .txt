Background: The Releaf AppTM mobile software application (app) data was used to
measure self-reported effectiveness and side effects of medical cannabis used under
naturalistic conditions.
Methods: Between 5/03/2016 and 12/16/2017, 2,830 Releaf AppTM users completed
13,638 individual sessions self-administering medical cannabis and indicated their
primary health symptom severity rating on an 11-point (0–10) visual analog scale in
real-time prior to and following cannabis consumption, along with experienced side
effects.
Results: Releaf AppTM responders used cannabis to treat myriad health symptoms, the
most frequent relating to pain, anxiety, and depressive conditions. Significant symptom
severity reductions were reported for all the symptom categories, with mean reductions
between 2.8 and 4.6 points (ds ranged from 1.29–2.39, ps < 0.001). On average, higher
pre-dosing symptom levels were associated with greater reported symptom relief, and
users treating anxiety or depression-related symptoms reported significantly more relief
(ps < 0.001) than users with pain symptoms. Of the 42 possible side effects, users
were more likely to indicate and showed a stronger correlation between symptom relief
and experiences of positive (94% of sessions) or a context-specific side effects (76%),
whereas negative side effects (60%) were associated with lessened, yet still significant
symptom relief and were more common among patients treating a depressive symptom
relative to patients treating anxiety and pain-related conditions.
Conclusion: Patient-managed cannabis use is associated with clinically significant
improvements in self-reported symptom relief for treating a wide range of health
conditions, along with frequent positive and negative side effects.

Medical Cannabis Effects
INTRODUCTION
Medicinal cannabis use is expanding rapidly in the United States,
with thousands of new users daily, particularly older patients
and people with significant health concerns, treating many
different symptoms (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2016; Han et al., 2016). Most patients have a wide variety
of medicinal cannabis products available to them, ranging
from traditional flower to edibles and tinctures. Naturalistic
observational studies are generally well-suited for capturing
how patients manage their treatment decisions in real-life, and
how patient-managed cannabis therapies may contribute to
symptom relief and potential side effects from use. Observational
research designs allow patients to use the myriad Cannabis strains
and cannabis-derived formulations (e.g., concentrates, tinctures,
edibles, topicals, suppositories, toothpaste) made at home and/or
commercially available and widely used in society, and can
incorporate the breadth of health conditions for which medical
cannabis has been sanctioned for use at the state-level. Lastly,
observational studies also circumvent research barriers associated
with cannabis’
Schedule I status under United States federal law,
which makes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) challenging to
conduct (Stith and Vigil, 2016; National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine, 2017).
Since its release in 2016, the commercially developed Releaf
AppTM application (app; Releaf App, 2018) has been the only
publically available, incentive-free patient educational software
program designed for recording how individual cannabis usage
sessions may correspond to immediate changes in primary
symptom intensity levels and experienced side effects. This
electronic assessment tool enables patients to monitor and
manage their cannabis consumption decisions under naturalistic
conditions while avoiding the limitations of retrospective survey
collection methods (e.g., memory bias, social desirability effects).
We used the Releaf AppTM repository of over 2,830 patients
and 13,368 individual cannabis administration sessions to
examine two research questions: How does cannabis used
under naturalistic conditions affect user-experienced symptom
relief and side effects? Does the magnitude of experienced
symptom relief and the prevalence of side effects vary across
symptom categories? The results have clinical relevance for
understanding how patient-managed medical cannabis therapies
may correspond to changes in symptom intensity and potential
side effects among people using cannabis for treating distinct
health conditions (Hill and Weiss, 2016; Rubin, 2017).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
A naturalistic observational research design, approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University of New Mexico,
was used to analyze the Releaf AppTM user-submitted data
recorded between 5/03/2016 and 12/16/2017. Releaf AppTM is
a cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile and tablet app
backed by a secure cloud programming interface for capturing,
processing, and storing anonymized user data. Out of 4,369 total
users and 23,373 user interactions, we included only cannabis
consumption sessions with reported starting symptom levels
greater than 0 (on a 0–
10, 11-point scale) and ending symptom
levels reported within 90 min of the start of the session, resulting
in a final sample of 2,830 users and 13,638 individual sessions
for analysis. The Releaf AppTM measures 27 possible negative
symptom categories and 42 possible side effects. Symptoms were
ultimately derived from qualifying conditions across medical
cannabis programs in the United States, along with a few
suggested by dispensaries and patients. The side effects (called
“
feelings”within the app) were crowd-sourced among Releaf
AppTM developers, beta testers, dispensaries, and patients, and
included 19 positive, 12 negative, and 11 context-specific side
effects available for selection. Supplementary Tables S1, S2 in
the Supplemental Appendix provide descriptive statistics for all
symptoms and side effects.
User sessions consist of a series of electronic instructions
for recording characteristics of the cannabis medication (e.g.,
strain, potency, formulation), pre-dosing symptom severity
rating along an 11-point visual analog facial pain scale from 0 (no
detectable symptom level) to10 (severe), the timing of cannabis
consumption, a post-dosing symptom severity rating, and the
option to indicate any of the 42 listed side effects at any time
during the session. Among our primary sample of users, 2,332
users reported side effects during 10,535 sessions.
Study Outcomes
Our goal was to calculate changes in patient-perceived symptom
severity, the prevalence of positive and negative side effects
associated
with
cannabis
consumption,
and
whether
the
reported-effects differs depending on the symptom for which
users were seeking treatment. We measured changes in
symptom relief by subtracting the ending symptom level from
the beginning symptom (possible range from −10 to 10).
(Supplementary Figure S1 in the Supplemental Appendix
provides a frequency table for each level of symptom relief.)
Side effects were recorded as {0,1} variables for whether the
user selected that side effect from the menu. We categorize the
side effects as positive, negative, or context-specific and then
convert these categories of side effects into {0,1} outcomes, count
outcomes and outcomes measuring the portion of total available
side effects in that category a user selected.
Statistical Analysis
We use means comparisons and least squares regression models
to estimate the absolute and relative symptom changes and side
effect profiles resulting from the cannabis user sessions. We also
created an adjusted symptom relief profile score, the mean change
in symptom levels plus the absolute number of listed negative
side effects, to provide a relative metric of cost-benefit tradeoffs
associated with cannabis use. Due to the small user counts for
some of the reported symptoms, the large number of possible
symptoms, and to facilitate interpretation in our regression
analysis, we aggregate the most commonly reported symptoms
across three broad symptom categories that included: Anxiety
Symptoms (agitation/irritability, anxiety, insomnia, stress, and
muscle spasms), Pain Symptoms (ten pain categories), and

Medical Cannabis Effects
Depression Symptoms (depression). The remaining types of
symptoms are less frequently reported or not clearly categorized.
We also report the full regression results for the three
categories of side effects (positive, negative, and context-specific)
and the sign for regressions of symptom relief on the full
range of 42 side effects. Standard errors are clustered at
the user level to control for heteroskedasticity and arbitrary
correlation.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the starting and ending symptom severity levels,
the change in levels, the Cohen’
s d of the difference, and the
adjusted symptom relief profile score for each of the 27 discrete
symptom categories. For all symptoms, the null hypothesis that
the starting symptom severity level is less than or equal to the
ending symptom severity can be rejected at the p < 0.001 level.
Using the adjusted symptom relief measure (symptom relief plus
negative side effects), all but users with convulsions, dizziness,
excessive appetite, or tremors experienced a net improvement
in their symptom severity levels. Even for these symptoms, the
adjusted mean symptom relief score still indicates a net benefit
from use and the lack of a statistically significant change likely
relates more to the small number of observations rather than the
lack of an effect, given that these symptoms together constituted
less than 3% of users and less than 1% of our sample. For all other
symptoms, the null hypothesis of an increase or no change in the
adjusted symptom relief score can be rejected at the p < 0.001
level.
Table 1 provides additional information on starting and
ending symptom severity levels, mean symptom relief, and
the prevalence of positive, negative, and context-specific side
effects by the aggregated symptom categories (anxiety, pain,
and depression symptoms). For completeness, we include a fifth
column including the remaining discrete symptom categories
which did not fall under the three aggregated symptom
categories. Little variation exists in starting and ending symptom
levels and the symptom relief experienced, with the average user
reporting a symptom decrease of 3.7. With regards to side effects,
those with depression have a higher probability of reporting
negative or context-specific side effects. The most common
positive side effects are “
relaxed”(64%), “
peaceful”(54%), and
“
comfy”(38%), the most common negative side effects are “
dry
mouth”
(23%), “
foggy”
(22%), and “
forgetful”
(13%) and the most
common context-specific side effects are “
high”(32%), “
sleepy”
(27%), and “
thirsty”(27%).
Table 2 examines how symptom relief varies across the
broader symptom categories, with the constant representing
the mean adjusted symptom change for the omitted category,
(patients with pain-related symptoms). The first two regressions
shown in Table 2 indicate that people with anxiety and depression
report greater relief from using cannabis than people with chronic
pain, and users with higher starting symptom levels report
greater symptom relief. (The effects of cannabis on anxiety and
depression symptoms are not statistically different from each
other, although they are both greater than the effect of cannabis
on pain-related symptoms). Negative responses or increases in
symptom severity do occur, but the intercept in combination with
the starting symptom level predicts that increases in symptom
severity levels predominantly occur among users with starting
symptoms equal to one. The third column in Table 2 shows that
cannabis is more effective for anxiety and depression symptoms
than for pain-related symptoms among patients reporting higher

symptom severity levels (A graphical representation of this
relationship is presented in Supplementary Figure S2 in the
Supplemental Appendix).
In order to take advantage of the full range of symptom
categories available to Releaf AppTM
users, we also ran
regressions including dummy variables for each of the symptoms,
using back pain as the omitted category. After controlling for
starting symptom level, clustering the standard errors at the user
level, and using a statistical significance threshold of p < 0.05,
our results indicate that patients report greater symptom relief
for treating agitation/irritability, anxiety, depression, excessive
appetite, insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, gastrointestinal pain,
stress, and tremors than they do for treating back pain. Patients
reported less symptom relief for treating impulsivity, headache,
and nerve pain as compared to relief for treating back pain. The
symptom relief for the other discrete symptom categories was
indistinguishable from the reported symptom relief associated
with back pain.
Table 3 explores whether patients using cannabis to treat pain,
anxiety, or depressive symptoms differ in their experiences of
positive, negative, or context-specific side effects. Chows tests

the number of reported side effects for each category divided by the total number of possible side effects a user could select in that category. Robust standard errors are

are no more or less likely than those with pain symptoms to
report any of the three categories of side effects. Individuals
with depression, however, are more likely to report negative
and context-specific side effects than positive side effects. Higher
starting symptom levels are also associated with more negative or
context-specific side effect reporting and this relationship persists
whether the side effect profile is defined as any of the side effects
from that category of side effects, the number of side effects by
category, or the percent of possible side effects in a category.
Table 4 tests whether different types of side effects are
associated with differences in symptom relief. The results are
robust across specifications; reporting positive or context-specific
side effects is associated with greater symptom relief, while
reporting negative side effects is associated with less symptom
relief. For example, based on Column (4), a person with a starting
symptom level of 5 who reports 100% of negative side effects
would experience a 0.5 point increase in symptom severity on
a 1–
10 scale, whereas a similar user who does not report any
negative side effects would experience 2.2 points of symptom
relief, highlighting the importance of adjusting for starting
symptom severity level and side effect profiles when evaluating
the overall effectiveness of cannabis as a treatment modality.
DISCUSSION
This is the largest observational study to measure immediate
changes in patient-reported symptom severity ratings and
experienced side effects in real-time from using cannabis under
naturalistic conditions. Building on previous research showing
that cannabis may be an effective substitute for opioids (Hurd,
2016; Vigil et al., 2017) and other classes of prescription
medications (e.g., sedatives; Piper et al., 2017; Stith et al.,
2017), we provide evidence that cannabis is used to treat
many different types of symptoms for which conventional
pharmaceutical medications are typically prescribed, and that the
magnitude of reported symptom relief and side effect profiles
from using cannabis varies for people with different symptoms.

The Releaf AppTM users consumed cannabis to treat a wide
range of health symptoms, the most frequent relating to pain,
anxiety, or depression. Clinically and statistically significant
reductions in patient-reported symptom severity levels existed
in every single symptom category, suggesting that cannabis
may be an effective substitute for several classes of medications
with potentially dangerous and uncomfortable side effects
and risky polypharmaceutical interactions, including opioids,
benzodiazepines, and antidepressants (Weich et al., 2014;
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016; Fontanella
et al., 2016; Rudd et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2016). Higher
pre-dosing symptom levels were generally associated with greater
post-dosing symptom relief and users treating an anxiety-related
symptom or depression showed stronger symptom relief than
users treating a pain symptom, even though depression is not a
condition approved for medical cannabis use in most states.
Similar to clinical reviews showing that cannabis is associated
with numerous, yet generally non-serious side effects (Wang
et al., 2008; Whiting et al., 2016), positive and context-specific
side effects were more commonly reported than negative side
effects by the Releaf AppTM users, with the most frequent
reported side effects being positive (relaxed, peaceful, comfy) and
the least frequent side effects being negative (paranoid, confused,
headache). Positive side effect reporting was associated with the
greatest reported symptom relief, followed by context-specific
side effects, while negative side effects were associated with lower
reported symptom relief. In general, patients treating depression
were more likely to indicate a negative side effect than patients
treating anxiety- or pain-related symptoms, though even users
who reported only negative side effects reported significant
decreases in moderate to severe symptom intensity levels after
using cannabis.
One of the most striking patterns in the current results was
the breadth of symptoms that appeared to improve following
cannabis consumption. This pattern of responses could have been
a function of characteristics of the software user interface (e.g.,
symptom intensity scale range), manner in which responders
interacted with their mobile device (e.g., visual attention to
common symptom severity levels), or with the systemic nature
by which phytocannabinoids may affect the human mind and
body. According to the endocannabinoid deficiency theory,
many mental and physical health disturbances result from the
dysregulation of the body’
s innate endocannabinoid system (ECS;
Smith and Wagner, 2014; Di Marzo et al., 2015; Karhson
et al., 2016; Russo, 2018), often described as a master network
of chemical signals that promote somatic and psychological
homeostasis, or psychobiological state-efficiency (Bermudez-
Silva et al., 2010; Silvestri and Di Marzo, 2013; Acharya et al.,
2017). The ECS consists of natural ligands (e.g., anandamide and
2-AG) and receptors (CB1 and CB2) that appear to play a major
role in efficient regulation of a wide range of systems that include
sleep, feeding (e.g., gut permeability and adipogenesis), libido and
fertility, pain perception, motivation, happiness, anxiety, learning
and memory, social functioning, autoimmune responses, cellular
redox, and cancer pathophysiology (Valvassori et al., 2009;
Muccioli et al., 2010; Abdel-Salam et al., 2012; Cani, 2012;
Burstein, 2015; Du Plessis et al., 2015; McPartland et al., 2015;
Karhson et al., 2016; Pava et al., 2016; Tegeder, 2016; Turcotte
et al., 2016; Androvicova et al., 2017; Sierra et al., 2018). In other
words, unlike conventional pharmaceutical approaches, which
largely target specific neurotransmitter sites (e.g., monoamine
neurotransmitter hypothesis; Delgado, 2000; Ng et al., 2015),
cannabis may act to improve a broad spectrum of symptoms
by regulating homeostatic functioning, perhaps best described as
a system-modulating rather than symptom-modulating form of
therapy.

Medical Cannabis Effects
the study was limited primarily by the lack of a control
group, e.g., non-cannabis users with the same symptom using
a mobile device to indicate their immediate symptom intensity
levels. There is also the potential confound of user-selection
bias and exclusion of users that failed to complete sessions
or even use the Releaf AppTM due to a lack of symptom
relief or negative side effects. (It is possible that selection bias
could have worked in the opposite way, excluding patients
that are already satisfied with their cannabis choices and
therefore choose not to use the software app). This study
chose to focus on the existence of symptom relief and side
effects rather than offer clinical guidance as to which cannabis
products offer preferential symptom relief and side effects
profiles. As such we did not include product characteristics,
e.g., routes of administration, quantity and method of ingestion,
and cannabinoid content, all of which are likely crucial for
understanding how cannabis affects symptom relief and side
effect manifestation. We only show that, on average, most
cannabis users experience symptom relief. Future research
will benefit by incorporating these contextual factors into
measurements of patient decisions and by dissecting how
fundamental characteristics of the cannabis products themselves
affect immediate and longer term changes in symptom relief and
potential adverse consequences.
Patients with certain health conditions such as neurological
disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache)
may face differential risks for experiencing adverse effects or
exacerbating their symptoms, for instance, depending on the
amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol they consume, and
caution should be used for patients considering using highly
potent cannabis products (Solimini et al., 2017). Complicating
matters are the allogamous (variable) and unstable nature of the
Cannabis plant and the inherent inconsistencies in the chemical
contents across plant batches and derived formulations, which
are affected by genetic characteristics, but also environmental,
cultivation, and storage conditions (Thomas and Pollard, 2016;
Pacifici et al., 2017, 2018). These factors present challenges for
both medical cannabis consumers and researchers as patients
never have continuous access to cannabis products with precisely
consistent chemotypes. Cannabis-based products (e.g., dried
flower vs. oils) can differ in their dose reliability, and researchers
have offered guidelines for dosing titration and experimental
usage (Kahan et al., 2014; Pichini et al., 2018). However, until
federal laws currently restricting pharmacodynamics research
in the United States are reformed (Stith and Vigil, 2016)
investigators still have tremendous opportunities to develop and
incorporate innovative assessment tools, like the Releaf AppTM,
into observational research designs for measuring how patients
experience self-directed cannabis treatment in their normal
everyday lives outside of clinical settings.
