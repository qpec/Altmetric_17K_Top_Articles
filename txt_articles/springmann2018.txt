and their association with environmental impacts: a global 
modelling analysis with country-level detail

Summary
Background Sustainable diets are intended to address the increasing health and environmental concerns related to 
food production and consumption. Although many candidates for sustainable diets have emerged, a consistent and 
joint environmental and health analysis of these diets has not been done at a regional level. Using an integrated 
health and environmental modelling framework for more than 150 countries, we examined three different 
approaches to sustainable diets motivated by environmental, food security, and public health objectives.
Methods In this global modelling analysis, we combined analyses of nutrient levels, diet-related and weight-related 
chronic disease mortality, and environmental impacts for more than 150 countries in three sets of diet scenarios. 
The first set, based on environmental objectives, replaced 25–100% of animal-source foods with plant-based foods. 
The second set, based on food security objectives, reduced levels of underweight, overweight, and obesity 
by 25–100%. The third set, based on public health objectives, consisted of four energy-balanced dietary patterns: 
flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan. In the nutrient analysis, we calculated nutrient intake and changes 
in adequacy based on international recommendations and a global dataset of nutrient content and supply. In the 
health analysis, we estimated changes in mortality using a comparative risk assessment with nine diet and weight-
related risk factors. In the environmental analysis, we combined country-specific and food group-specific footprints 
for greenhouse gas emissions, cropland use, freshwater use, nitrogen application, and phosphorus application to 
analyse the relationship between the health and environmental impacts of dietary change.
Findings Following environmental objectives by replacing animal-source foods with plant-based ones was 
particularly effective in high-income countries for improving nutrient levels, lowering premature mortality 
(reduction of up to 12% [95% CI 10–13] with complete replacement), and reducing some environmental impacts, in 
particular greenhouse gas emissions (reductions of up to 84%). However, it also increased freshwater use (increases 
of up to 16%) and had little effectiveness in countries with low or moderate consumption of animal-source foods. 
Following food-security objectives by reducing underweight and overweight led to similar reductions in premature 
mortality (reduction of up to 10% [95% CI 9–11]), and moderately improved nutrient levels. However, it led to only 
small reductions in environmental impacts at the global level (all impacts changed by <15%), with reduced impacts 
in high-income and middle-income countries, and increased resource use in low-income countries. Following 
public health objectives by adopting energy-balanced, low-meat dietary patterns that are in line with available 
evidence on healthy eating led to an adequate nutrient supply for most nutrients, and large reductions in premature 
mortality (reduction of 19% [95% CI 18–20] for the flexitarian diet to 22% [18–24] for the vegan diet). It also markedly 
reduced environmental impacts globally (reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 54–87%, nitrogen application by 
23–25%, phosphorus application by 18–21%, cropland use by 8–11%, and freshwater use by 2–11%) and in most 
regions, except for some environmental domains (cropland use, freshwater use, and phosphorus application) in 
low-income countries.
Interpretation Approaches for sustainable diets are context specific and can result in concurrent reductions in 
environmental and health impacts globally and in most regions, particularly in high-income and middle-income 
countries, but they can also increase resource use in low-income countries when diets diversify. A public health 
strategy focused on improving energy balance and dietary changes towards predominantly plant-based diets that 
are in line with evidence on healthy eating is a suitable approach for sustainable diets. Updating national dietary 
guidelines to reflect the latest evidence on healthy eating can by itself be important for improving health and 
reducing environmental impacts and can complement broader and more explicit criteria of sustainability.

Introduction
The food people eat impacts their health and the health 
of the environment. Imbalanced diets low in fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, and whole grains and high in red and 
processed meat are responsible for the greatest health 
burden worldwide and in most regions.1 In addition to 
imbalanced diets, about 2 billion people are overweight 
and obese, 2 billion have nutritional deficiencies, and 
about 800 million are still suffering from hunger due to 
poverty and poorly developed food systems.2 As the 
dietary transition towards more processed and high-
value food products (in terms of cost and perceived value) 
continues in many regions of the world, these dietary 
health risks are expected to worsen.3
The environmental impacts of food production are 
similarly daunting. Agriculture is responsible for about a 
quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions,4 it occupies 
about 40% of the Earth’s surface5 and uses 70% of 
all freshwater resources,6 and the overapplication of 
fertilisers in some regions has led to pollution of surface 
water and groundwater and created dead zones in oceans.7 
As a result, the global food system has contributed to the 
crossing of several of the proposed planetary boundaries 
that attempt to define a safe operating space for humanity 
on a stable Earth system.8 In the absence of dedicated 
mitigation strategies or changes in demand, many of 
these environmental impacts are expected to intensify as 
demand for foods with greater environmental impact, 
such as meat and dairy, increases and the global 
population grows from 7 billion to a predicted 10 billion 
in the next 30 years.9
The concept of sustainable diets combines the chal-
lenges of creating a food system that supplies healthy 
diets for a growing population while reducing its en-
vironmental impacts and staying within planetary 
boundaries.10,11 The literature on sustainable diets has 
grown substantially in the past decade,12–15 and the concept 
has been expanded to economic, ethical, and cultural 
aspects of diets.10 However, consistent health analyses of 
commonly proposed diets are scarce,16 and approaches 
that are based primarily on health rather than environ-
mental objectives are, with few exceptions,3,17 rarely 
considered.
Here, we use a comprehensive modelling framework 
for more than 150 countries and regions  to analyse the 
environmental and health impacts of three different 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Several systematic reviews of the sustainable diet literature 
have been published since 2014. These reviews have suggested 
that reductions in environmental impacts of food production 
are generally proportional to reductions in animal-source 
foods. However, most studies included in the reviews were 
national case studies from high-income countries with a 
predominant focus on greenhouse gas emissions as 
environmental impact, and the studies generally used different 
reference diets, environmental footprints, and scenario designs, 
all of which complicates comparisons between studies. With a 
few exceptions, the health impacts of the sustainable-diet 
scenarios were often not explicitly analysed beyond adherence 
to national dietary guidelines or directional changes in nutrient 
levels. One systematic review of the health impacts of diets 
with reduced greenhouse gas emissions found no consistent 
relationship, but some association of such diets with decreased 
micronutrient content.
Added value of this study
Here, we increase the evidence base beyond summaries of 
national case studies by using a study design that allows for a 
consistent and region-specific assessment of the health and 
environmental impacts of dietary changes for all world regions 
and more than 150 individual countries. Our study includes a 
full nutritional analysis, a comparative risk analysis with nine 
dietary and weight-related risk factors, and an environmental 
analysis with five domains, including greenhouse gas 
emissions, cropland use, freshwater use, nitrogen application, 
and phosphorus application. Our results indicate that 
energy-balanced, predominantly plant-based dietary patterns 
that are in line with the current evidence on healthy eating can 
lead to reductions in environmental impacts in high-income 
and middle-income countries, while improving nutrient levels 
and reducing diet-related premature mortality in all regions. In 
low-income countries, adoption of healthier diets can increase 
demand for environmental resources, in part due to inefficient 
production systems and baseline diets high in staple crops. 
Across regions, the associations between health and 
environmental benefits are strongest for greenhouse gas 
emissions, moderate for the demand for cropland, nitrogen, 
and phosphorus, and small for freshwater use. Our analysis 
contributes to several open questions in the literature regarding 
the association between environmental and health impacts, 
the importance of improving energy imbalances and changing 
dietary composition, and the generalisability of national case 
studies.
Implications of all the available evidence
Sustainable diets are context specific. They attain nutritional 
adequacy and reduce diet-related mortality by addressing both 
dietary composition and energy balance, and they balance 
environmental impacts between global and regional scales. 
Our study shows that a synergistic perspective on sustainable 
diets would include technological and management-related 
aspects, in addition to dietary and environmental aspects. 
Updating national dietary guidelines to reflect the latest 
evidence on healthy eating is important for improving health 
and reducing environmental impacts, and can complement 
broader and more explicit criteria of sustainability.

approaches to sustainable diets, with a focus on the 
nutritional implications and impacts on chronic, non-
communicable disease mortality, and how they relate 
to changes in greenhouse gas emissions, cropland use, 
freshwater use, nitrogen application, and phosphorus 
application. We distinguish between three different app-
roaches: those that follow the environmental objectives of 
reducing the impacts of animal-source foods; those that 
follow the food-security objectives of addressing energy 
imbalances; and those that follow the public health object-
ives of encouraging nutritionally balanced dietary patterns 
based on available evidence on healthy eating.
Methods
Scenario design
In this global modelling analysis, we assessed the effects 
of three sets of dietary-change strategies (panel; appendix 
pp 7–9) on health and environmental factors in more 
than 150 countries and compare these effects across 
different regions worldwide. 
Our baseline data consists of current and projected 
levels of food consumption and weight distributions. In 
our main analysis, we focused on the year 2010 for 
analysing nutrient adequacy and on the year 2030 for the 
mortality and environmental analyses to allow for a 
transition time for dietary and technological changes. 
Additionally, we used the years 2010 and 2050 in sensi-
tivity analyses to study the effects of technological and 
socioeconomic changes.
We estimated baseline and projected food intake 
for more than 150 countries by adapting food de-
mand projections from the International Model for 
Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade 
(IMPACT) that were based on a harmonised dataset of 
country-specific food availability data, and we adjusted 
those for food waste at the household level (appendix 
pp 2–4).19 For estimating the prevalence of under 
-
weight (body-mass index [BMI] <18 kg/m²), overweight 
(BMI ≥25 to <30 kg/m²), and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) in 
each country, we fitted log-normal distributions to WHO 
estimates of mean BMI and the prevalence of overweight 
and obesity using a cross-entropy method that jointly 
mini 
mised the deviation of the prevalence data,20 and we 
projected weight changes using correlations between 
changes in mean BMI and changes in food availability 
(appendix pp 5–6).20
In the first diet pattern set that we assessed, which was 
based on environmental concerns by reducing animal-
source products, we progressively reduced the amount of 
animal-source 
foods 
in 
each 
country’s 
diet 
by 
25% (ani-25), 50% (ani-50), 75% (ani-75), and 100% 
(ani-100) and replaced it with plant-based foods. On the 
basis of observational data on food-group substitution 
across dietary patterns, we chose a substitution rule by 
which two-thirds of animal-source foods were replaced 
by legumes and a third by fruits and vegetables. We kept 
the total energy content of the diets constant to isolate 
the effects of changes in dietary composition in this set 
of scenarios. In the second set, based on food security 
and improving energy balance, we progressively reduced 
levels of underweight, over 
weight, and obesity in a 
simultaneous fashion by 25% (kcal-25), 50% (kcal-50), 
75% (kcal-75), and 100% (kcal-100). For adjusting total 
energy intake, we applied scaling factors to baseline diets 
that preserved their composition. In the third set, based 
on public health priorities, we constructed four 
nutritionally balanced dietary patterns that are in line 
with evidence on healthy eating.18 For that purpose, we 
used energy-balanced varieties of the flexitarian, 
pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan dietary patterns 
defined by the EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy Diets 
from Sustainable Food Systems (appendix pp 7–9). The 
flexitarian dietary patterns contain no processed meat, 
low amounts of red meat (including beef, lamb, and 
pork) and sugar, moderate amounts of poultry, dairy, and 
fish, and generous amounts of fruits, vegetables, 
legumes, and nuts. The other three dietary patterns 
replace meat (pescatarian or vegetarian) or all animal-
source foods (vegan) with two-thirds either fish and 
seafood (pescatarian diets) or legumes (vegetarian and 
vegan diets) and a third fruits and vegetables. We 
regionalised the public health dietary patterns for each 
country by preserving the national preferences for types

environmental objectives
Replacement of 25–100% of animal-source foods with plant-

Nutritionally balanced diet patterns in line with available 
evidence on healthy eating:
• 
Flexitarian: no processed meat, small amounts of red 
meat (one serving per week), moderate amounts of other 
animal-source foods (poultry, fish, and dairy), and 
generous amounts of plant-based foods (fruits, 
vegetables, legumes, and nuts)
• 
Pescatarian: replaces meat with two-thirds fish and 
seafood and a third fruits and vegetables
• 
Vegetarian: replaces meat with two-thirds legumes and 
a third fruits and vegetables
• 
Vegan: replaces all animal-source foods with two-thirds 
legumes and a third fruits and vegetables

of grains, fruits, red meat, and fish. The diet patterns 
were all compared with a benchmark diet based on our 
estimates of current and future food consumption and 
weight distributions, including increased consump 
tion 
of high-value products (animal-source foods), in line 
with income and population changes. 
Nutrient analysis
We analysed the nutrient adequacy of the diet scenarios 
by calculating their nutrient content and comparing 
these values to international recommendations. For 
calculating the nutrient content, we paired the con-
sumption of each food group with its nutrient density as 
reported in the Global Expanded Nutrient Supply 
dataset,21 a global dataset of nutrient supply of 23 nutrients 
across 225 food categories for more than 150 countries, 
supplemented by nutritional data on pantothenate and 
vitamin B12 from the nutrient databases maintained 
by Harvard University and the US Department of 
Agriculture. For our analysis, we aggregated the nutrient 
dataset to the commodity and regional detail of our 
consumption data, and we normalised calorie densities 
to those of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization 
for consistency with our diet scenarios (appendix 
pp 10–11). We then compared the calculated nutrient 
content of the diet scenarios to recommendations by 
WHO. Because the recommendations differ by age and 
sex, we calculated population-level average values for 
each nutrient by using the age and sex structure for the 
year of analysis based on data by the Global Burden of 
Disease project and forward projections by the UN 
Population Division. Our estimates of recommended 
energy intake account for the age-specific and sex-specific 
energy needs for a moderately active population with US 
height as an upper bound and include the energy costs of 
pregnancy and lactation.22 Our estimates of calcium 
intake account for the average calcium content of 
drinking water in line with previous assessments.23 
Because WHO did not set guidelines for phosphorus 
and copper, we used recommended intakes for these 
nutrients from the US Institute of Medicine.
Mortality analysis
To analyse the implications of dietary change for chronic 
disease mortality, we constructed a comparative risk 
assessment framework with nine risk factors and 
five disease endpoints. The risk factors included high 
con 
sumption of red meat, low consumption of fruits, 
vegetables, nuts and seeds, fish, and legumes, as well as 
being underweight (BMI <18·5 kg/m²), overweight (BMI 
≥25 to <30 kg/m²), or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m²). The 
disease endpoints were coronary heart disease, stroke, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer (in aggregate and as site-
specific ones, such as colon and rectum cancers), and an 
aggregate of other causes that are associated with 
changes in weight. The disease endpoints accounted for 
about half of all deaths in 2015,24 and the risk factors were 
responsible for two-thirds of deaths attributable to dietary 
risk factors, and for a third of all attributable deaths.1
We estimated the mortality and disease burden 
attributable to dietary risk factors by calculating population 
impact fractions and applying those to age-specific and 
country-specific mortality rates (appendix pp 12–13).25 
Population impact fractions are the proportions of cases of 
disease that would be avoided when the risk exposure was 
changed from a baseline situation (the benchmark diet) to 
a counterfactual situation (the dietary scenarios). We used 
relative risk estimates from meta-analyses of prospective 
cohort studies for dietary risks, which relate the risk 
factors to the disease endpoints, and pooled cohort studies 
for weight-related risks (appendix pp 14–20). In line with 
the meta-analyses, we included non-linear dose–response 
relationships for fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, 
and fish, and assumed linear dose-response relationships 
for the remaining risk factors. Because our analysis was 
primarily focused on mortality from chronic diseases, we 
focused on adults aged 20 years or older, and we adjusted 
the relative risk estimates for attenuation with age on the 
basis of a pooled analysis of cohort studies focused on 
metabolic risk factors26 in line with other assessments.24 In 
addition to changes in total mortality, we calculated years 
of life lost (appendix p 20), but focus on changes in 
premature mortality among people aged 30–70 years in 
the main analysis.
Environmental analysis
For analysing the environmental impacts of the diet 
scenarios, we used a food-systems model that connects 
food consumption and production across regions 
(appendix pp 21–22), and we paired the production esti-
mates with country-specific environmental footprints for 
greenhouse gas emissions, cropland use, freshwater use, 
and nitrogen and phosphorus application (appendix 
pp 22–24).9 The food-systems model accounts for trade, 
feed, and processing of primary commodities and is 
calibrated with data from the IMPACT agriculture–
economic model.19 The greenhouse gas emissions associ-
ated with agriculture included methane and nitrous oxide 
emissions, but they exclude carbon dioxide emissions 
which, following the methods of the International Panel 
on Climate Change, are allocated to the energy sector 
or others. Freshwater use, as assessed here, denotes 
the consumption of surface water and groundwater, 
and nitrogen and phosphorus application are associated 
with fertiliser use. The footprints for animal-source 
foods include the indirect impacts associated with 
feed production and, for greenhouse gas emissions, 
direct impacts associated with methane emissions. 
The projec 
tion of environmental footprints includes im-
prove 
ments in technology and management practices 
along different socioeconomic development pathways 
(appendix pp 22–25).9
In this study, we report on the environmental analysis 
for contextualisation and focus on the comparison

between the health and environmental impacts. For that 
purpose, we focus on the directional changes in the 
environmental parameters, which provide a good indica-
tion for increased environmental pressures in most 
regions and globally.27 Some exceptions exist, especially for 
fertiliser use where increased application in low-applying 
regions can lead to increased agricultural yields with-
out major environmental impacts.28–30 Our socioeconomic 
development trajectories include a rebalancing of fertiliser 
application between overapplying and underapplying 
regions by 2050,28 which reduces the potential for such 
exceptions.
Uncertainty analysis
We accounted for the major uncertainties in each 
analysis. In the comparative risk analysis, we calculated 
uncertainty intervals associated with changes in mortality 
using error propagation and the CIs of the relative risk 
parameters (appendix pp 13, 28, 29). In the nutritional 
analysis, we explicitly calculated low and high supply 
values of each nutrient on the basis of the reported CIs 
(appendix p 26). And in the environmental analysis, we 
assessed un 
certainty by considering different population 
and income projections, which change the absolute 
amount and the dietary composition of foods demanded 
(appendix p 25).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. All authors had full access to all 
the data in the study and the corresponding author 
had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
Across the dietary-change scenarios, nutrient availability 
was generally improved for nutrients that were at low 
levels at baseline (2010), but with large differences 
between the scenarios (figure 1; CIs and regional results 
are reported in the appendix pp 26–27). In the scenarios 
that replace animal-source foods (ani-25, ani-50, ani-75, 
and ani-100), the macronutrient content of diets changed 
towards lower protein and fat content, with large reduc-
tions in saturated fatty acids. Protein intake remained 
adequate in high-income and middle-income countries, 
but they decreased to lower than recommended amounts 
in low-income countries. Micronutrient intake improved, 
particularly in high-income and middle-income coun-
tries, where large amounts of animal-source foods could 
be replaced by plant-based ones. In the high-income and 
middle-income countries, the baseline low levels of 
vitamin A, folate, iron, potassium, and fibre increased to 
greater than recommended values, but calcium, 
pantothenate (B5), and vitamin B12 decreased to less 
than recommended levels under full substitution. In low-
income countries, the small amounts of animal-source 
foods that were replaced were not enough to sufficiently 
increase vitamin A and potassium, and calcium and 
riboflavin also did not achieve recommended values.
In the scenarios focused on improving energy balance 
(kcal-25, kcal-50, kcal-75, and kcal-100), total energy intake 
was reduced to achieve recommended values in high-
income and middle-income countries, whereas it was 
increased to achieve recommendations in low-income 
countries (appendix p 27). Increased energy intake 
improved micronutrient intake in low-income countries, 
but vitamin A, folate, calcium, potassium, and riboflavin 
remained below recommended values. In high-income

and middle-income countries, reductions in energy 
intake did not improve the baseline low values of folate, 
iron, potassium, and fibre.
The scenarios based on balanced dietary patterns 
(flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan) combined 
the nutritional impacts of improving energy balance with 
food-based dietary guidelines for all regions. As a result, 
most of the nutrients that are at low levels in the baseline 
diets (vitamin A, folate, iron, potassium, and fibre), 
increased to recommended values in all four patterns. 
However, as in the other scenarios based on energy 
balance or animal-source food substitution, ribo 
flavin 
remained low, and calcium and vitamin B12 fell below 
recommended values in the vegetarian or vegan scenarios, 
or both (appendix p 27). These nutrients would have to be 
supplemented to attain the recommended value.
In the comparative risk assessment, premature 
mortality decreased both with reductions in animal-
source foods and with improvements in the energy 
balance of diets (figure 2A). Progressively replacing 
animal-source foods with plant-based foods led to 
progressive reductions in premature mortality of 4% 
(95% CI 4–4) in the ani-25 scenario up to 12% (10–13) in 
the ani-100 scenario in 2030 (absolute values are in the 
appendix pp 28–29). More than half of the total percentage 
reduction was due to increased vegetable consumption 
(51–58% across the scenarios), a third of the difference 
was due to increased fruit consumption (29–31%), a fifth 
due to increased legume consumption (18–23%), and a 
tenth due to reductions in red meat consumption (8–11%; 
figure 2A). Reduction in fish intake led to a 0·3–1% 
increase in premature mortality across the scenarios. 
Coronary heart disease (35–36%), stroke (32–34%), and 
cancer (29–30%) each accounted for about a third of 
deaths averted, and a small number were from type 2 
diabetes (2–3%; appendix p 30). The reductions in 
premature mortality were two to three times greater in 
high-income and middle-income countries (12–14% in 
the ani-100 scenario), where a larger portion of animal-
source foods can be substituted, than in low-income 
countries (5%; figure 3).
Progressively improving the energy balance of diets by 
reducing both underconsumption and overconsumption, 
while preserving the overall composition of diets (kcal-25, 
kcal-50, kcal-75, and kcal-100 scenarios), led to reductions 
in premature mortality from 2% (95% CI 2–3) in the 
kcal-25 scenario to 10% (9–11) in the kcal-100 scenario 
(figure 2A). Across risk factors, reductions in obesity 
contributed the most to the overall reduction in premature 
mortality (61–65% across the scenarios), followed by 
reductions in underweight (42–43%) and reductions in 
overweight (excluding obesity; 15–17%). As energy intake 
was adjusted upwards or downwards, the intake of 
specific foods increased or decreased, and in aggregate 
led to a 2% increase in mortality, in particular from 
reductions in fruit and vegetable consumption. Adjusting 
weight levels without affecting nutrition-sensitive food 
groups (eg, by adjusting staple foods) would increase the 
overall reduction in premature mortality by 19% (to a total 
reduction in premature mortality of 11%). Across disease 
endpoints, most averted premature deaths were from 
non-cardiovascular causes related to weight (about 60% 
with each of the four scenarios), followed by type 2 
diabetes (17%), cancer (9–12%), coronary heart disease 
(9–11%), and stroke (2–3%; appendix p 30). The reductions 
in premature mortality were generally evenly distributed 
across regions (8–14% across income groups in the 
kcal-100 scenario), with the greatest reduction in the 
upper-middle-income (14%) and high-income (12%) 
countries, which have high burdens of obesity, followed 
by low-income countries, (12%) which have high burdens 
of underweight, and lower-middle-income countries (8%) 
with an intermediate weight profile (figure 3).
Combining changes in dietary composition with 
changes in energy balance substantially increased the 
reductions in premature mortality that each strategy can 
achieve. Dietary changes to balanced flexitarian, pesca-
tarian, vegetarian, and vegan diets led to reductions in 
premature mortality of 19% (95% CI 18–20) for the 
flexitarian scenario to 22% (18–24) for the vegan scenario 
(figure 2A). Reductions in underweight, overweight, and 
obesity contributed similar proportions to reductions in

premature mortality (11% across the four diets), as did 
change in diet composition (9–12%). In the vegetarian and 
vegan scenarios, small increases in premature mortality 
(about 1%) from reduced fish intake were compensated 
(in part in the vegetarian scenario, and in full in the vegan 
scenario) by reductions in premature mortality from 
additional intake of legumes, fruits, and vegetables. 
Increases in nut consumption in the four scenarios, an 
aspect not included in the other dietary-change strategies, 
led to reductions in premature mortality (about 3%) in 
addition to those associated with replacing animal-source 
foods. Across disease endpoints, the averted premature 
deaths were about a quarter each from coronary heart 
disease 
(25–29%) 
and 
non-cardiovascular 
causes 
(25–30%), a fifth (19–21%) from cancer, followed by stroke 
(14–18%) and type 2 diabetes (8–10%; appendix p 30). The 
reductions in premature mortality were generally evenly 
distributed across regions (eg, 19–24% across income 
groups in the flexitarian scenario), with the greatest 
reductions in upper-middle-income countries, where diets 
and energy intake were most imbalanced (figure 3).
For all 12 of the dietary-change approaches, the changes 
in environmental impacts differed by enviro 
nmental 
domain and region. Progressively replac 
ing animal 
products with plant-based foods led to large reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions (from 20% in the ani-25 
scenario to 84% in the ani-100 scenario) because the 
demand for emissions-intensive animal-source foods was 
reduced (figure 2B). However, fresh 
water use was 
increased (from 4% in the ani-25 scenario to 16% in the 
ani-100 scenario) because the demand for water-
demanding crops, such as legumes, vegetables, and fruits 
was increased (figure 2B; appendix pp 31–32). Regional 
analyses showed further differences. In upper-middle-
income and high-income countries, replacement of 
animal-source foods led to reduced cropland use (12% in 
upper-middle-income countries and 29% in high-income 
countries), nitrogen application (22% and 38%), and 
phosphorus application (25% and 35%), in line with 
reductions in the demand for livestock-related intensive 
feed production and fertilisation (figure 3). By contrast, 
these impacts increased in low-income and lower-middle-
income countries (cropland 1% in lower-middle-income 
countries and 15% in low-income countries; nitrogen 
application 7% and 1%; and phosphorus application 7% 
and 3%), which use less intensive feeds and fertilisers and 
had generally lower yields, so that the impacts of increased 
demand for legumes and vegetables outweighed feed-
related re 
ductions (figure 3).
Improving the energy balance of diets led to moderate 
reductions across environmental impacts globally (8–13% 
in the kcal-100 scenario; figure 2B; appendix pp 31–32). 
Environmental impacts were reduced in high-income and 
middle-income countries (8–18% in the kcal-100 scenario), 
where levels of overweight and obesity required a reduction 
in energy intake. By contrast, impacts were increased 
(3–8% in the kcal-100 scenario) for greenhouse gas 
emissions, cropland use, and freshwater use in low-
income countries, where levels of underweight required 
an increase in energy intake (figure 3).
Globally, moving to the balanced dietary patterns 
resulted in large reductions in greenhouse gas emiss-
ions (54–87% across the scenarios), medium-level reduc-
tions in nitrogen application (23–25%) and phosphorus 
application (18–21%), and small to moderate reduc-
tions in cropland (8–11%) and freshwater use (2–11%; 
Figure 3: Regional changes in premature mortality and environmental impacts of dietary change
The scenarios include diets in which all animal-source foods have been replaced by plant-based ones (ani-100; A), 
diets with optimal energy intake and weight levels (kcal-100; B), and flexitarian diets that are energy balanced and 
contain small amounts of animal-source foods (flexitarian; C).

figure 2B; appendix pp 31–32). Greenhouse gas em-
issions and nitrogen application were reduced in all 
regions, but the changes in cropland use, freshwater 
use, and phosphorus application were split into reduc-
tions in high-income and middle-income countries and 
increases in low-income countries (figure 3; appendix p 
31), in line with regional differences in yields, water use, 
and fertilisation intensity.
Several scenarios showed alignment between the health 
and environmental benefits of dietary change, but 
large differences existed between regions and dietary-
change approaches (figure 3, 4). For the scenarios re-
ducing animal-source foods (ani scenarios), reductions in 
premature mortality were positively associated with re-
ductions in greenhouse gas emissions and negatively 
associated with freshwater use. Other environmental 
domains had mostly positive relationships with mortality 
in high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and 
negative relation 
ships in low-income and lower-middle-
income countries. For the scenarios aimed at improving 
energy balance (kcal scenarios), the changes in en-
vironmental impacts were positively associated with 
changes in premature mortality in high-income and 
middle-income countries, but they were negatively associ-
ated in low-income countries (figure 4). The balanced 
dietary-pattern scenarios (flexitarian, pescatarian, veg-
etarian, and vegan) showed the greatest alignment 
of health and environ 
mental impacts, with positive 
association for almost all environmental domains in 
high-income and middle-income countries, but negative 
associations for cropland use, freshwater use, and phos-
phorus application in low-income countries.
In a sensitivity analysis, we analysed the influence 
the time period has on the health and environmental 
impacts of dietary change. Analysing dietary changes in 
2050 instead of 2030 resulted in greater alignment of 
the health and environmental impacts as technol-
ogies and manage 
ment practices improved, particularly 
for fresh 
water and cropland use (appendix p 33). Con-
versely, analysing dietary changes in 2010 resulted in 
greater relative increases in cropland and freshwater 
use than in 2030. Considering data of the emissions of 
carbon dioxide (based on a global meta-analysis of 
lifecycle analyses31) instead of the data limited to me-
thane and nitrous oxide emissions as in the main 
analysis, increased greenhouse gas emissions, particu-
larly from fishing, and as a result widened the differ-
ence between the pescatarian and vegetarian scenarios 
(appendix p 34).
Discussion
The concept of sustainable diets combines health and 
environmental concerns. Although many candidates for 
sustainable diets have emerged, no consistent and joint 
environmental and health analysis of these diets has 
been done at a regionally comparative level. Here, we 
examined three stylised approaches to sustainable diets 
using an integrated health and environmental modelling 
framework for more than 150 countries. Our results 
show that a public health approach focused on dietary 
Figure 4: Coefficients of association between health and environmental impacts
Coefficients were calculated by dividing the percentage changes in environmental impacts by the percentage changes in premature mortality. Positive values (green) indicate that health and 
environmental changes are aligned (larger values show stronger positive associations), whereas negative values (red) indicate opposing changes (more-negative values show stronger negative 
associations). Darker shades show stronger associations, whereas lighter shades show weaker associations.

changes towards predominantly plant-based diets that 
are in line with evidence on healthy eating performs 
better in reducing environmental pressures, potential 
nutrient deficiencies, and diet-related mortality than 
approaches motivated only by environmental and food-
security concerns.
Our analysis has several strengths. It significantly 
improves on the methods used in existing global assess-
ments by doubling the number of risk factors and en-
vironmental indicators covered.3,17 It improves the detail of 
dietary scenarios by including, in the balanced dietary-
pattern scenarios, recommended ranges for all major food 
groups based on the available evidence on healthy eating 
as reviewed by the EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy 
Diets from Sustainable Food Systems. And it covers all 
major countries and regions in a comparative fashion, 
which allows for the identification of regional differences 
that extend the evidence base beyond national case 
studies.12,14,15
Where comparisons are possible, our results are 
consistent with empirical data and other estimates with 
similar coverage. The nutritional estimates are based on 
existing datasets, and the assessment of nutritional levels 
and potential deficiencies is in line with existing analyses 
for most nutrients, but can differ for calcium for which 
we used global recommended intake values instead of 
the sometimes higher national values,32 and for zinc, for 
which we assumed medium bioavailability rather than 
using a function of absorption that is not yet validated.23 
Our mortality estimates from changes in dietary risk 
factors are similar to those of comparable dietary patterns 
in cohort studies.33,34 However, by analysing the disease 
burden of dietary patterns in equilibrium, we abstracted 
from many real-world complexities, such as time lags 
between adoption of diets and changes in mortality. 
Although most of the relative risk factors used have been 
adjusted for major confounding factors, such as smoking, 
bodyweight, and other dietary risks, residual confounding 
with other parameters cannot be ruled out completely. In 
line with our joint focus on the health and environmental 
impacts of dietary change, we focused on those risk 
factors that we could include on the basis of food-
availability data, and we did not include risk factors, such 
as processed meat and whole grains, that would have 
required processing factors on the basis of data derived 
by a different method.35 Including those risk factors as 
part of recommendations to reduce processed meat 
consumption and increase whole grain con 
sumption 
would further increase the estimated benefits of dietary 
change in the dietary-pattern and substitution scenarios 
(appendix pp 14–20). The environmental assessment is 
based on data that reflects current environmental 
impacts at the country level (appendix pp 22–23), and the 
scenario changes are in line with other assessments with 
similar detail.9 
Our results highlight the regional differences in the 
health and environmental impacts of dietary-change 
strategies. Following an environmental strategy by 
substituting animal-source foods can be particularly 
effective in high-income countries for improving nutrient 
levels, lowering premature mortality, and reducing some 
environ 
mental impacts, in particular greenhouse gas 
emissions. However, it can also lead to increased 
freshwater use, and has little effectiveness in countries 
with low or moderate consumption of animal-source 
foods. Following a food-security strategy by improving the 
energy balance of diets can lead to similar reductions in 
premature mortality, but in our model scenarios it only 
moderately improved nutrient levels and led to small 
reductions in environ 
mental impacts at the global level, 
with reduced impacts in high-income and middle-income 
countries, and increased resource use in low-income 
countries. Following a public health strategy by adopting 
energy-balanced, low-meat dietary patterns that are in line 
with available evidence on healthy eating addressed the 
problems of high regional variability of the animal-
substitution scenarios and the low nutritional and 
environmental effectiveness of the weight scenarios. 
Adopting the balanced and predominantly plant-based 
dietary patterns led to an adequate nutrient supply, except 
for a small number of nutrients (riboflavin, calcium, and 
vitamin B12), which might have to be supplemented, large 
reductions in premature mortality, and significant 
reductions in environmental impacts globally and in 
most regions, except for some environ 
mental domains 
(cropland use, freshwater use, and phosphorus applica-
tion) in low-income countries.
Our analysis has several implications for the study of 
sustainable diets. First, qualitative differences exist 
between the health and environmental benefits that can be 
attained by dietary changes. Our analysis suggests that 
although a comprehensive and context-specific public 
health strategy for dietary change can lead to healthier 
diets in all regions, differences between the environmental 
impacts and regions are large. Dietary changes towards 
healthy, low-meat diets can be effective in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, moderately effective in 
reducing cropland use and fertiliser application in high-
income and middle-income countries, but less effective for 
reducing freshwater use, particularly in low-income 
countries. Changes in low-income countries depend 
more strongly on technological improvements and 
changes in manage 
ment,9 suggesting that a synergistic 
perspect 
ive on sustainable diets should include both 
technological and dietary aspects. Although reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions is important at the global level 
for mitigating climate change, changes in the other 
domains relate to predominantly local environ 
mental 
impacts. This highlights the need for context-specific 
strategies that balance environmental impacts between 
global and regional scales.
Second, addressing dietary composition and energy 
intake as part of food-based dietary guidelines could be a 
comprehensive strategy for achieving sustainable diets.

Whether food-based dietary guidelines should include 
sustainability criteria has been a major issue of discussion 
in several countries.13,36 In this study, we find that when 
food-based dietary recommendations reflect available 
evidence on healthy eating, including balanced energy 
intake, low amounts of red meat and sugar, low to 
moderate amounts of other animal-source foods, and 
generous amounts of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and 
nuts, then the resulting diets would be in line with 
sustainability criteria of reducing environmental impacts 
in most regions, and they would still improve dietary 
health in the remaining ones. However, many national 
dietary guidelines do not reflect this evidence on healthy 
eating and include no or too lax limits for animal-source 
foods, particularly meat and dairy,37 despite an opposing 
evidence base (appendix pp 14–20).38–40 A general problem 
is that many nutrient recommendations used to formulate 
food-based dietary guidelines are based on a few short-
term studies with few participants that measure nutrient 
pass-through in high-consuming individuals instead of 
lower limits.41 By contrast, most of the available evidence 
on healthy eating comes from long-term and large-scale 
epidemiological cohort studies.18 Our results show that 
updating national dietary guidelines to reflect the latest 
evidence on healthy eating can by itself be important for 
improving health and environmental sustainability, 
and can complement broader and more explicit criteria of 
sustainability.
Some unanswered questions remain. We were not able 
to include all aspects of importance to sustainable diets, 
including biodiversity impacts and economic aspects.10 
Although biodiversity impacts are related to land use in a 
given region, impacts can be expected to differ on the 
basis of a region’s biodiversity richness and how land use 
is managed. With respect to economic aspects, large 
changes in food demand and supply can be expected to 
affect production methods, technologies, and commodity 
prices, which in turn would impact environmental foot-
prints, agricultural incomes, the affordability of diets, and 
purchasing behaviour. Identifying concrete policy options 
that could support the dietary changes modelled here is 
similarly important. Globally, overweight and obesity, as 
well as consumption of red meat and dairy are projected 
to increase in the future without dedicated policy 
approaches.42,43 Although informational campaigns and 
voluntary actions by industry can be important, the 
literature on behavioural change suggests that they are 
unlikely to be effective on their own.44,45 Instead, cross-
cutting regulatory approaches that focus on the whole 
food environment,46 combine multiple incentives includ-
ing fiscal ones,47,48 and offer support and positive re-
enforcement for individuals49,50 have been successful in 
specific contexts, but would need to be upscaled to lead to 
substantial dietary changes at the population level. 
Finding effective combinations of policies and approaches 
that consider local characteristics will be essential for 
success 
fully upscaling initiatives and achieving reductions 
in the health and environmental burden at the population 
level and globally.
