IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) recently has been shown to be an antecedent infection
in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), but the clinical spectrum of HEV-associated GBS is not yet
documented, and diagnosing acute HEV infection can be a challenge.
OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of HEV-associated GBS in a Belgian cohort, study
the clinical spectrum of HEV-associated GBS, and discuss difficulties in diagnosing acute HEV
infection.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center, retrospective cohort study was
conducted between January 1, 2007, and November 1, 2015. All patients with GBS or a GBS
variant who presented to the adult neurology department of the University Hospital Leuven
were identified via a search of the electronic medical records. Hepatitis E virus IgM and IgG
reactivity was determined. In a subgroup, polymerase chain reaction for HEV was performed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hepatitis E virus IgM and IgG reactivity.
RESULTS Of 73 eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 52 [18] years; 29 females and 44 males), 6
(8%) showed positive reactivity on IgM assays for HEV, indicating a possible acute HEV
infection. Four of the 6 patients (67%) had increased alanine aminotransferase levels of more
than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, while 4 of 22 patients (18%) with increased alanine
aminotransferase levels showed positive reactivity on HEV IgM assays. Serum samples of 2 of
6 patients with positive reactivity on HEV IgM assays also revealed positive test results for
cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus, indicating possible cross-reactivity. Thus, 4 patients
(6%) in our cohort had probable acute HEV infection. Two of these patients presented with
an infrequent GBS variant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Acute HEV infection was frequently associated with GBS in
our cohort. Abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels at admission can indicate the presence
of an associated HEV infection. When HEV testing is considered, it is important to test for
other infectious agents in parallel, as cross-reactivity can occur. Further studies are required
to guide neurologists in their workup of underlying triggers of GBS.

G
uillain-Barrésyndrome(GBS)ischaracterizedinitsclas-
sic form by a rapidly progressive bilateral and rela-
tively symmetric weakness of the limbs with or with-
out involvement of respiratory muscles or muscles innervated
by the cranial nerves, with a maximum level of weakness
reached within 4 weeks.1 Many clinical variants of GBS
have been described according to the regional distribution
of weakness (eg, limbs, ocular, or bulbar) or the relative
involvement of motor vs sensory nerves. A postinfectious,
immune-mediated disorder of the peripheral nerves and
nerve roots is the most likely disease mechanism for GBS.1
Studies in humans and animals have provided convincing
evidence that at least some cases of GBS are caused by an
infection-induced aberrant immune response that damages
the peripheral nerves.2-9 About two-thirds of patients have
symptoms of an infection in the 3 weeks before the onset of
weakness. The most common infectious causes of GBS are
Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus
influenzae.10,11 An association between infection with hepa-
titis E virus (HEV) and GBS has been suspected in several
case reports and retrospective cohort studies of patients
with HEV infection.12-29 In 2013, a prospective case-control
study reported positive IgM antibodies against HEV in 11%
of patients with GBS in Bangladesh.30 A second case-control
study identified an associated acute HEV infection in 5% of
patients with GBS in the Netherlands.31
Hepatitis E virus is a nonenveloped RNA virus belonging
to the Hepeviridae family that has an icosahedral capsid and
3 open reading frames. Four HEV genotypes have been de-
scribed. It is a common virus that is the most frequent cause
of viral hepatitis worldwide and is endemic in one-third of the
world population. In the Western world, HEV genotypes 3 and
4 are principally transmitted zoonotically to humans from an
animal reservoir (eg, domesticated pig, wild boar, deer, and
rabbits) by eating undercooked meat or via contaminated
water.32-34 Infection with HEV has been associated with many
neurological diseases apart from GBS, such as neuralgic
amyotrophy,35-39 meningoencephalitis,25,40,41 myelitis,42,43
myositis,22,44cranialneuropathies,29,45-47myastheniagravis,48
and pseudotumor cerebri.21,49-51
In this study, we retrospectively assessed the prevalence
of acute HEV infection in a cohort of Belgian patients with GBS
or a variant of GBS and compared this prevalence with other
infections known to be associated with GBS. Furthermore, we
explored GBS disease parameters that are specific to HEV.
Methods
Patients
We searched the electronic medical records to identify all pa-
tients with GBS or a variant of GBS who presented to the adult
neurology department of the University Hospital Leuven be-
tweenJanuary1,2007,andNovember1,2015.Allpatientswith
a diagnosis of GBS or a variant who presented within the first
4 weeks after the onset of neurological symptoms were in-
cluded. Using criteria described in the literature, all patients
were divided into the following clinical categories: pure
motor GBS, Miller-Fisher syndrome, Bickerstaff brainstem
encephalitis, acute ataxic neuropathy, bifacial weakness with
distal paresthesias, acute multiple cranial neuropathic condi-
tions, pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, and overlap syn-
dromes (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).52-61 We excluded pa-
tientswhoweretransferredtoourhospitalafteradministration
of intravenous immunoglobulins as well as patients without
ausableserumsampleinthelaboratoryserumbank.Thisstudy
was approved by the ethical committee and the biobank of the
University Hospital Leuven. As this was a retrospective study,
the University Hospital Leuven Institutional Review Board did
not require informed consent.
We recorded the following clinical features from the medi-
cal records: date of onset of neurological symptoms, date of
onset and type of antecedent infection, age at onset, sex, im-
munestatusbeforesymptomonset,clinicalvariantofGBS,cra-
nial nerve involvement, immunomodulatory treatment, need
for intubation, and GBS disability score at nadir and after 3 to
6 months.62 If present, the following laboratory results were
recorded: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin
levels at admission or highest level before presentation and
before the start of any medical therapy, date and results of
lumbar puncture, presence of anti-ganglioside or anti-
sulfatideantibodies(IgMandIgGagainstGM1,GM2,GM3,GM4,
GD1a, GD1b, GD2, GD3, GT1a, GT1b, GQ1b, and sulfatides), and
infectious serologic tests in serum and stool cultures. The date
and results of nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle elec-
tromyography were also recorded.63 Patients were classified
into different electrophysiologic variants of GBS (acute inflam-
matory demyelinating polyneuropathy, demyelinating, acute
motor axonal neuropathy, acute motor and sensory axonal
neuropathy, or inexcitable) according to Hadden et al63 (eAp-
pendix 2 in the Supplement).
Microbiological Testing on Stored Sera
Serum samples—aliquoted, stored at –20°C, and collected be-
fore the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins—
were retrieved from the laboratory serum bank and used for
HEV serologic testing. All samples were previously tested for
C jejuni antibodies, M pneumoniae, IgG and IgM for EBV, and
Key Points
Question What is the importance of, and what are the challenges
in, diagnosing an acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection as a
preceding infection in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome or a
variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome?
Findings This cohort study finds that acute hepatitis E virus
infection is frequently associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome,
presenting with a heterogeneous phenotype. Cross-reactivity with
other pathogens must be taken into account to make a certain
diagnosis of infection with hepatitis E virus.
Meaning In a classic or atypical presentation of Guillain-Barré
syndrome, one should consider testing the patient for an
associated hepatitis E virus infection but always in parallel with
testing for other pathogens, since cross-reactivity is possible.

IgG and IgM for CMV as part of the routine diagnostic workup.
Serologic testing for H influenzae was not routinely performed.
Testing for HEV was performed as follows. First, an en-
zymeimmunoassay(EIA)wasperformed(recomWellHEVIgM/
IgG enzyme immunoassay, MIKROGEN Diagnostik) following
the manufacturer’
s recommendations: positive when the re-
sults are above 24 U/mL, equivocal when they are between 20
and 24 U/mL, and negative when they are less than 20 U/mL.
IncasesofequivocalreactivityforHEVIgMorinthecaseofcon-
current presence of positive serologic findings for other infec-
tious agents (ie, CMV or EBV) and an equivocal or positive EIA
result for HEV IgM, a confirmatory recombinant immunoblot
test (RIBT) for HEV IgM (recomLine HEV IgM, MIKROGEN Di-
agnostik) and EIA for HEV IgM and IgG on later serum samples
wasperformed,withremainingserumsamples(ifavailable)sent
to the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health for HEV re-
versetranscriptasepolymerasechainreaction(RT-PCR)(RealStar
HEV RT-PCR kit 1.0, Altona Diagnostics). An acute HEV infec-
tion was considered possible in the case of positive results on
anti-HEVIgMEIAand/orpositiveresultsonanti-HEVIgMRIBT.
In cases with positive serologic markers for anti-HEV IgM and
other pathogens, RT-PCR for those other pathogens was per-
formed on the serum samples used for HEV assays to exclude
false anti-HEV reactivity by these agents. Probable acute HEV
infectionwasdefinedaspossibleinfectionintheabsenceofsig-
nificantcross-reactivitytootherpathogens.Theadditionalpres-
ence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies or positive results on RT-PCR
for HEV on serum samples was considered as suggestive of a
definite HEV infection.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as medians (ranges) or means (SDs). Normal
distribution of data sets was determined with the Shapiro-Wilk
normality test. A t test was used to compare the quantitative
variablesiftheywerenormallydistributed.A2-tailed,unpaired
Mann-Whitney test was used if variables were not normally
distributed. P < .05 was considered significant.

our cohort are presented in the Figure.
When assessing possible acute HEV infection preceding
GBS, we found positive anti-HEV IgM on EIA and/or RIBT in 6
patients (8%). Of those, 4 (67%) had ALT levels more than 1.5
times the upper limit of normal. We found no significant age
difference between patients with anti-HEV IgM antibodies vs
those without such antibodies (mean age, 61 vs 52 years;

ful paresthesia and paresis in both arms, with development of
scapular winging on the right side, only 1 day after reporting
general discomfort and fever. Consecutive NCS and the elec-
tromyogram showed signs of progressive axonal loss in both

We studied the contribution of HEV infection to elevated
ALT levels65 in the entire cohort and found 22 patients with
elevated (>1.5 times the upper limit of normal) ALT levels. In
8 of those cases (36%), positive anti-CMV IgM reactivity was
found. The second most common finding was a possible acute
HEV infection seen in 4 patients (18%). One patient demon-
strated positive reactivity for EBV and 1 for M pneumoniae. For
patients with positive serologic markers for multiple patho-
gens,everypathogenwascounted.Ofthe36patientswithnor-
mal ALT levels, 1 (3%) had HEV IgM antibodies (patient 6). Of
the 51 patients with ALT levels less than 1.5 times the upper
limit of normal, 2 (4%) had positive HEV IgM serologic find-
ings (patients 2 and 6).
Discussion
The demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as results
of laboratory tests, NCS, and electromyography, of our cohort
ofpatientswithGBSwerecomparablewiththoseofearlierpub-
lishedcohorts.Guillain-Barrésyndromeaffectedmales1.5times
more often than females.1,66 The mean age in our cohort was
slightly higher than anticipated, but this finding may be owing
to the fact that we did not include children.66 Similar to find-
ings in previous reports, the sensory-motor (classic) variant of
GBS was the most frequent, seen in 77% of patients, compared
with rates of 75% to 80% in an earlier study.54 We found anti-
bodies to various gangliosides and sulfatides in only 16 pa-
tients (22%), while other studies have reported the presence of
those antibodies in about half of the patients with GBS or
variants.1InseveralcasereportsofGBSwithassociatedHEVin-
fection, anti-ganglioside antibodies to GM1 or GM2 were
found.14,15,17,24,25,28Inlinewithalargercase-controlserieswith
10 patients,31 none of the HEV-associated cases in our cohort
had anti-ganglioside or anti-sulfatide antibodies. An acute de-
myelinating neuropathy was the most frequent electrophysi-
ologic variant in our cohort. Only 7% of patients had an axonal
variant(acutemotoraxonalneuropathyoracutemotorandsen-
sory axonal neuropathy), which is similar to findings in other
reports.66Inlinewithotherstudies,wealsoobservedthatmost
patients with Miller-Fisher syndrome or Bickerstaff brainstem
encephalitis had no or only slight abnormalities on results of
NCS. Overall, our cohort has the characteristics of a represen-
tative sample of patients with GBS and variants.
The seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG in our cohort is lower
(18%) than that found in a cohort with GBS from the Nether-
lands (46%).31 Moreover, they found no significant difference
in seroprevalence between controls and the patients with GBS.
The exact seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG in Belgium is not
known, but our value in patients with GBS or a variant was
similar to the seroprevalence of 14% seen in a small cohort of
Belgian orthopedic and obstetric patients.67 This percentage
is lower than findings, mostly in blood donors, from the Neth-
erlands (27%), Germany (29%), Bangladesh (50%), and south-
west France (34%-52%),31,68 and suggests that important
locoregional differences in HEV prevalence occur.
We found that 8% of our patients had positive anti-HEV
IgM on EIA and/or RIBT, indicating a possible acute HEV in-
fection. This rate is lower than that in a cohort of patients with
GBS from Bangladesh (11%), where HEV is endemic,30 but
higher than the rate found in a Dutch cohort (5%).31 However,
in the latter study, a more strict definition of acute HEV infec-
tion was used: positive serologic results for anti-HEV IgM and
IgG or, if results for anti-HEV IgG were negative, positive se-
rologic results for IgM and RT-PCR performed on serum
samples.31 Using this definition, 4 of our patients (6%) would
have met the criteria for acute HEV infection (excluding pa-
tients 4 and 6). Patients 1 and 3 are clear cases of acute HEV
infection, also following this more strict definition. Patients 2
and 5 also fulfill these serologic criteria. However, patient 6 is
also a likely case of an acute HEV infection with positive se-
rologicresultsforanti-HEVIgM.Unfortunately,aserumsample
from this patient at a later time point to demonstrate sero-
conversion for HEV IgG was not available. Use of RT-PCR
performed on serum samples for HEV has a limited added
value, as negative results of RT-PCR do not exclude a recent
infection because HEV RNA is rapidly cleared and typically
becomes undetectable within 3 weeks after onset of the
infectious episode.32
One of the most important diagnostic challenges we en-
countered, which was not fully addressed in previous stud-
ies, was the co-occurrence of positive results of infectious
serologic tests for different pathogens at the same time. The
limit value of M pneumoniae in patient 5 was deemed irrel-
evant, and cross-reactivity between HEV and M pneumoniae
also has not been described. We thus retain patient 5 as a case
of definite acute HEV infection. Patients 2 and 4, however, had
positive serologic results for CMV or EBV IgM and IgG. Cross-
reactivity on serologic tests between HEV, CMV, and EBV has
been described, giving rise to false-positive results of HEV IgM
owing to CMV or EBV infection or giving rise to false-positive
results of CMV or EBV IgM owing to HEV infection.69-71 This
cross-reactivity is mentioned in the manufacturer’
s instruc-
tions for the recomLine test. Cross-reactivity with EBV, but not
with CMV, is described in the manufacturer’
s instructions for
the recomWell test. However, cross-reactivity with CMV when
using the older version of the test has been described.69 These

issues suggest that the assays are not perfect and that it is dif-
ficult to obtain a definite diagnosis in some patients. It is our
hope that further refinement of the immunoassays will elimi-
nate the issue of cross-reactivity in the future. This refine-
ment might also help in resolving the possibility of a co-
infection. Since patient 4 had a positive result for RT-PCR
performed on serum samples for CMV, she probably had an
acute CMV infection or reactivation of CMV. Taking these fac-
tors into account, we had 4 cases (6%) of definite or probable
acute HEV infection in our cohort (excluding patients 2 and 4,
not 4 and 6, when following the serologic criteria from the
Dutch cohort31).
Similar to an older report in the literature,65 we observed
elevated liver enzymes in about one-third of the patients with
GBS. Eight of these patients (36%) had positive reactivity for
CMV IgM. Reactivity for HEV IgM appears to be the second
most common finding in patients with GBS who have
elevated ALT levels, seen in 18% of our cohort. When exam-
ining only cases of probable or definite acute HEV infection
in our cohort, 3 of 22 patients (14%) had significant elevation
of ALT levels. This finding suggests that HEV is the second
most common cause of elevated ALT levels in patients with
GBS. However, not all patients with HEV-associated GBS
have elevated ALT levels. Therefore, testing for HEV should
be considered in patients with normal liver enzyme levels.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. As it is a retrospective study,
not every patient received the same diagnostic workup.
Another limitation was the absence in particular cases of
follow-upserumsamplesatlatertimepoints,whichcouldhave
helped to demonstrate seroconversion.
Conclusions
Acute HEV infection was frequently associated with GBS or
variants of GBS in our cohort. Depending on the stringency
of the definition of HEV positivity, 8% or 6% tested positive.
The phenotypes associated with GBS ranged widely from
classic GBS to a pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant and a
sensory ataxic variant. Abnormal ALT levels at admission
can indicate an associated HEV infection. Testing for other
infectious agents in parallel is important since cross-
reactivity with EBV and CMV is possible with current assays.
Performing RT-PCR to detect viral nucleic acids does not
always allow us to make definitive conclusions, as the test
results may be negative owing to the short viremia in an
acute HEV infection. Further studies are required to guide
neurologists in their workup of the underlying causes of
GBS.
