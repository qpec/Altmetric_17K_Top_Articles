Purpose
Cisplatin is widely used but highly ototoxic. Effects of cumulative cisplatin dose on hearing loss have
not been comprehensively evaluated in survivors of adult-onset cancer.
Patients and Methods
Comprehensive audiological measures were conducted on 488 North American male germ cell
tumor (GCT) survivors in relation to cumulative cisplatin dose, including audiograms (0.25 to 12 kHz),
tests of middle ear function, and tinnitus. American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria
defined hearing loss severity. The geometric mean of hearing thresholds (0.25 to 12 kHz) sum-
marized overall hearing status consistent with audiometric guidelines. Patients were sorted into
quartiles of hearing thresholds of age- and sex-matched controls.
Results
Increasing cumulative cisplatin dose (median, 400 mg/m2; range, 200 to 800 mg/m2) was significantly
related to hearing loss at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 kHz (P trends, .021 to , .001): every 100 mg/m2 increase
resulted in a 3.2-dB impairment in age-adjusted overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz; P , .001). Cu-
mulative cisplatin doses . 300 mg/m2 were associated with greater American Speech-Language-Hearing
Association–defined hearing loss severity (odds ratio, 1.59; P = .0066) and worse normative-matched
quartiles (odds ratio, 1.33; P = .093) compared with smaller doses. Almost one in five (18%) patients had
severe to profound hearing loss. Tinnitus (40% patients) was significantly correlated with reduced hearing
at each frequency (P , .001). Noise-induced damage (10% patients) was unaffected by cisplatin dose (P =
.59). Hypertension was significantly related (P = .0066) to overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz) in age- and
cisplatin dose–adjusted analyses. Middle ear deficits occurred in 22.3% of patients but, as expected, were
not related to cytotoxic drug dosage.
Conclusion
Follow-up of adult-onset cancer survivors given cisplatin should include routine inquiry for hearing status
and tinnitus, referral to audiologists as clinically indicated, and hypertension control. Patients should be
urged to avoid noise exposure, ototoxic drugs, and other factors that further damage hearing.

INTRODUCTION
The current 5-year relative survival rate for all
cancers taken together approximates 66%.1 As
a result, there are 14.5 million cancer survivors in
the United States. This number will increase to 19
million by 2024,2 with 97% representing survi-
vors of adult-onset cancer. Given these increasing
numbers, in-depth investigations of treatment
toxicities that affect functional status, such
as cisplatin-related hearing loss and tinnitus,
are increasingly important.3 Cisplatin is one of
the most ototoxic drugs in clinical use, causing
permanent, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in
substantial numbers of patients, with many ex-
periencing permanent tinnitus.4-6 Nonetheless,
few comprehensive audiometric data exist for
cisplatin-associated hearing loss in adult-onset
cancer
survivors.

 patients with head and neck cancer were confounded by cranial
radiotherapy7-9; limitations of other studies included small num-
bers,6 concomitant vincristine,6,10,11 and restriction of audiometric
testing to just a few frequencies.10,11 To our knowledge, only one series
evaluated hearing loss in terms of cumulative cisplatin dose,11 and
none included audiometric assessments of noise-induced damage,
middle ear function, or evaluation of speech processing.4,6-11
To fill important gaps in these areas, we conducted com-
prehensive audiometric testing in relation to cumulative cisplatin
dose in 488 men with adult-onset germ cell tumors (GCT), testing
all frequencies between 0.25 and 12 kHz and evaluating audio-
logically defined noise-induced damage, speech processing, tin-
nitus, patient-reported outcomes, and middle ear function.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
All patients were enrolled in the Platinum Study, which includes eight
cancer centers in the United States and Canada.12-15 Eligibility criteria
included: men with a diagnosis of histologically or serologically confirmed
GCT, age younger than 50 years at diagnosis and age 18 years or older at
study consent, treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and no
subsequent salvage chemotherapy. Study procedures were approved by the
Human Subjects Review Board at each institution. This report covers all
488 patients who completed audiometric testing through April 16, 2015.
Data Abstracted From Medical Records
For each patient, standardized forms were used to collect demographic
and clinical data, including treatment information.16,17 Dose data were collected
for cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin, with cumulative dose available for 95%
of patients included in dose-response analyses. For the remaining 5%, cu-
mulative dose was imputed from the median dose administered to all patients
given the same regimen. Of all patients, 88% received either three to four cycles
of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP), or four cycles of etoposide and
cisplatin (EP) at currently recommended standard doses.
Audiometric Testing
Pure-tone air conduction thresholds were obtained bilaterally for each
patient at frequencies of 0.25 to 12 kHz as in prior studies,18-20 covering the
speech frequency range, including those important for perceiving vowels and
consonants. Frequencies of 10 and 12 kHz were included, given their im-
portance in the early diagnosis of pediatric cisplatin-induced hearing loss.21-23
Otoscopy and bone-conduction thresholds (0.25 to 4 kHz) evaluated middle
ear function. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs), which use speech stimuli
consisting of two-syllable words, quantified speech processing.
Classification of hearing loss and assessment of severity. International
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) criteria defined
hearing loss as a hearing threshold at any frequency (0.25 to 12 kHz) that
exceeded 20 dB for either ear.24-26 ASHA criteria defined hearing loss
severity as follows: mild: 21 to 40 dB; moderate: 41 to 55 dB; moderately
severe: 56 to 70 dB; severe: 71 to 90 dB; and profound: . 90 dB; for at least
one tested frequency for either ear.24
Statistical analysis. Cumulative cisplatin dose (mg/m2) was com-
pared with the air conduction threshold at each frequency in the 0.25 to 12
kHz range, with statistical significance defined as P , .05 for dose in the
linear regression model: hearing threshold = dose + age at audiometry. No
evidence for nonlinearity of the cisplatin dose-response relationship was
observed, as evaluated by comparisons of the linear model with cubic and
quadratic models at each frequency (P . .05 in all cases).
To derive a summary measure of each patient’s overall hearing status
across all frequencies taken together (0.25 to 12 kHz), we calculated the
geometric mean of air conduction hearing thresholds, consistent with
previous audiometric guidelines.27 For each patient i, the geometric mean
Yi was calculated using standard methods28 by taking the arithmetic mean
of the natural log-transformed hearing threshold, di, from n frequencies
and then using exponentiation to return the computation to the
original dB scale (ie, log-average):
Yi ¼ exp
 
1
n �
n
i¼1
lndi
!
This summary measure Yi (overall hearing threshold [0.25 to 12 kHz]) was
normally distributed on the basis of histogram shape, and the Shapiro-
Wilk test29 for departure from normality was not significant (P = .24). The
summary measure Yi was tested for association with age at diagnosis or age
at audiometry using a linear regression model: overall hearing threshold =
age. Asymmetry was defined as a . 20-dB difference in geometric means
between ears.
The effect of cumulative etoposide dose (mg/m2) and bleomycin dose
(units) on the geometric mean of air conduction thresholds (4 to 12 kHz)
was evaluated with and without cumulative cisplatin dose as a covariate.
Statistical significance was defined as P , .05 for the dose term in the
following linear regression model: hearing threshold = dose + age at
audiometry (+ doseCisplatin). Standard audiometric definitions30 de-
fined noise-induced hearing loss as hearing thresholds at 6 and 8 kHz
at least 5 dB less (better hearing) than thresholds at middle frequencies
(3 to 4 kHz).
Comparisons with normative population. Given the relationship be-
tween changes in hearing thresholds with increasing age,31 results were
compared with a large unscreened male reference population32 as ap-
plied in a previous study.10,33 Although several investigations described
audiometrically defined hearing patterns in male populations,34,35 only
Engdahl et al32 provided the quartiles of hearing thresholds (4, 6, 8 kHz)
for a broad age range (eg, 20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and 60 to 69
years). For frequencies for which we observed statistically significant re-
lationships between increasing cumulative cisplatin dose and increasing
(worse) hearing thresholds (4, 6, 8, 10, 12 kHz), normative data were
available for 4, 6, and 8 kHz.32
Statistical analysis. For each patient, we compared the geometric
mean of hearing thresholds (4, 6, 8 kHz) to the expected geometric mean in
the age-specific normative sample for 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.32
Each patient was allocated to the respective quartile (1 to 4) of the reference
population, with quartile 4 representing the most severe hearing im-
pairment. Cumulative cisplatin dose groups (# 300 mg/m2 and . 300 mg/m2)
were tested for association with age-matched normative quartiles
(quartile = dose group) and with ASHA-defined severity classes (severity
class = dose group + age at audiometry) by ordinal regression. The
300 mg/m2 cut point was chosen, given its correspondence to the most
commonly used study regimen (BEP), with the standard three cycles
resulting in a cumulative cisplatin dose of 300 mg/m2.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Patients completed questionnaires concerning neurotoxic symptoms,
lifestyle habits, comorbidities, and medication use.36 The Scale for
Chemotherapy-Induced Neurotoxicity (SCIN), validated in testicular
cancer survivors (TCS) given cisplatin-based chemotherapy,37 was used to
query tinnitus and hearing; this was supplemented with validated hearing
questions from Ventry and Weinstein38 regarding noise exposure, hearing
aid use, and problems hearing words or language in crowds.
Statistical analyses. SCIN results, smoking status (current smoker,
ever smoker), and hypertension (defined as prescription medication for
hypertension) were compared with the overall hearing threshold (4 to
12 kHz) and SRT. To test whether each variable (response) was associated
with hearing thresholds, we fit the following linear regression model: overall
hearing threshold = response + age at audiometry. All statistical models
were fit using R version 3.1.1 (http://www.R-project.org/). Plots were

 constructed using the R package ggplot2.39 SCIN results and supplemental
hearing-related questions were also tested for association with normative
age-defined quartiles. For all analyses, statistical significance was defined as
P , .05 (two-sided).
RESULTS
Median age at diagnosis was 31 years (range, 15 to 49 years), and
median interval between chemotherapy and audiometry was 4.25
years (range, 1 to 30.3 years; Table 1). Chemotherapy consisted
largely of BEP (60.5%) or EP (32.0%). Median cumulative cisplatin
dose was 400 mg/m2 (range, 198 to 800 mg/m2). Hypertension
(with prescription medication) was reported by 12.3% of pa-
tients; 30.5% and 5.9% of patients were former and current
smokers, respectively.
Overall Hearing Loss
Audiogram shapes showed a largely high-frequency, sloping
hearing loss, with substantial interindividual variation (Fig 1).
Only 20% of patients had normal hearing (ie, flat audiogram; Fig
1A), whereas others had differing degrees of hearing loss, with
ASHA-defined mild, moderate, moderately severe, or severe/
profound hearing loss, in 25%, 16%, 21%, and 18%, re-
spectively (Figs 1B to 1F).24 For two patients with ear asymmetry,
data were averaged.
Most patients (388 of 488, 80%) had a hearing loss of . 20 dB
(Fig 2).24 The overall pattern of kHz-specific hearing thresholds
accentuated its high-frequency nature, with the largest reductions
at 12 kHz. Age at either audiometry (P , .001) or GCT diagnosis
(P , .001) strongly associated with impaired overall hearing
threshold (0.25 to 12 kHz). Because these variables were highly
correlated (R = 0.79), only the former was subsequently applied.
Cumulative Cisplatin Dose
Statistically significant age-adjusted relationships between
increasing cumulative cisplatin dose and increasing (worse)
hearing thresholds (dB) existed for 4 kHz (P = .021), 6 kHz
(P = .0017), 8 kHz (P , .001), 10 kHz (P , .001), and 12 kHz
(P = .0013), but not for other frequencies (Appendix Fig A1, online
only). Cumulative cisplatin doses . 300 mg/m2 were associated
with increased ASHA severity classes24 compared with # 300 mg/
m2 after age adjustment (Fig 3; odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% CI,
1.14 to 2.21; P = .0066). Moderately severe to profound hearing
loss occurred in 29.5% and 44.6% of patients, respectively, after
# 300 mg/m2 and . 300 mg/m2 of cisplatin. Dose group did not
correlate with age (P = .24).
Comparisons to Normative Population
Figure 4A shows subject distribution by age and normative
hearing quartile. Patients administered . 300 mg/m2 cisplatin
were more likely to be in a higher quartile (worse hearing) than
those given # 300 mg/m2 (Fig 4B; OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.85;
P = .093). For every 100-mg/m2 increase in cumulative cisplatin
dose, a 3.2-dB decline in overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz)
occurred after age adjustment (Fig 5A; P , .001). Time from
chemotherapy to audiometry correlated with worse overall hearing

 (R = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.32), likely a result of the strong positive
correlation with age (R = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.55). On adjustment
for both age and time since chemotherapy, we still observed for every
100-mg/m2 increase in cumulative cisplatin dose a 3.3-dB decline
in overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz; P , .001). In this
multivariate model, time from chemotherapy was not significant
(P = .42), whereas age was highly significant (P , .001).
Noise-Induced Hearing Loss
Of 388 patients with hearing loss (. 20 dB) at any frequency,
39 (10%) also displayed audiometrically defined noise damage.
Risk did not differ for patients given a cumulative cisplatin dose
of . 300 mg/m2 or # 300 mg/m2 (P = .59), nor did noise damage
affect normative quartile assignment (P = .42). Work-related noise
exposure was associated with a noise notch in the audiogram (OR,
1.89; 95% CI, 0.96 to 3.69; P = .062), as observed by others.38
Conductive Hearing Loss (middle ear deficit)
Of all 488 patients, 58% (283) had pure sensorineural hearing
loss, 0.4% (two) had pure conductive hearing loss, and 21% (103) had
mixed hearing loss. As expected, no association with cumulative dose
of cisplatin, etoposide, or bleomycin was evident for the 105 patients
with conductive hearing loss (P = .78, 0.69, 0.42, respectively).
Other Risk Factors
In analyses adjusted for age and cisplatin dose, impaired
overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz) was significantly associated
with hypertension (n = 60; P = .0066). No significant association
was evident for current smoking (n = 29; P = .079) or ever smoking
(current plus former; n = 178; P = .095).
Associations With Patient-Reported Outcomes
Approximately 30% and 40% of patients, respectively, re-
ported reduced hearing or tinnitus (Table 1). Impaired overall
hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz) was strongly associated with
degree of self-reported hearing loss (P , .001) and with tinnitus
(P , .001) after age adjustment (Fig 5B). Statistically significant
relationships between tinnitus and impaired hearing thresholds
were observed at each frequency: 0.25 kHz (P = .012), 0.5 kHz

Hearing Loss and Tinnitus After Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy
 (P = .0058), 1 kHz (P = .0019), 1.5 kHz (P , .001), 2 kHz (P , .001),
3 kHz (P , .001), 4 kHz (P , .001), 6 kHz (P , .001), 8 kHz
(P , .001), 10 kHz (P , .001), and 12 kHz (P , .001). Similar
results were obtained for SRT and tinnitus (P = .0039) and reduced
hearing (P , .001; Fig 5C). Tinnitus did not correlate with time
since chemotherapy (P = .17)
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive study
of cisplatin-associated ototoxicity in survivors of adult-onset
cancer, including quantitative comparisons of frequency-specific
audiometric findings with patient-reported outcomes. New find-
ings include statistically significant associations between in-
creasing cumulative cisplatin dose and hearing loss at each of 4, 6,
8, 10, and 12 kHz and with severity of hearing loss defined by
ASHA criteria.24 Highly significant associations between hearing
loss at each kHz frequency and tinnitus were observed, in ad-
dition to significant correlations between SRT and tinnitus and
self-reported hearing loss. Cumulative cisplatin dose was not
related to audiometrically defined noise-induced hearing loss.
Impaired overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz) was signifi-
cantly associated with hypertension but not smoking status.
Middle ear deficits were observed.
There are few audiometric data in survivors of adult-onset cancer
treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy without cranial radio-
therapy. Among 86 TCS, Bokemeyer et al6 tested frequencies of 0.5 to
8 kHz at a median of 4.8 years after cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
Hearing loss was reported in 66% of patients, but frequency-specific
associations with cumulative cisplatin dose were not examined.
Glendenning et al11 evaluated frequencies of 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz among
260 TCS, with cumulative cisplatin dose associated with hearing loss
only at 8 kHz. An investigation of several hundred cisplatin-treated
TCS in Norway restricted audiometric testing to 4 kHz and com-
pared hearing loss with a normative population.10 Although TCS
given larger numbers of cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy
were assigned to greater hearing-impaired normative quartiles,
the effect of cumulative cisplatin dose was not addressed.10
More than 90% of our 488 patients received modern
cisplatin-based chemotherapy consisting largely of BEP or EP;
thus, results are relevant to current practice. Hearing deficits were
observed throughout the speech perception range, including the
higher frequencies reported in pediatric studies,21,23,40,41 likely
accounting for the strong correlation we observed for overall
hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz) and SRT and patient-reported
hearing deficits (Fig 5B).

Frisina et al
 One in five patients had severe or profound hearing loss,
a level at which hearing aids are typically recommended, but few
used them, likely because of high cost, lack of insurance coverage,
low performance/price ratio, or appearance.42 It is noteworthy that
awareness of this problem and the patient’s acceptance of hearing
loss typically increases hearing aid use.42 An additional 37% of
patients with moderate or moderately severe ASHA-defined
hearing loss would benefit from additional audiological follow-
up, as clinically indicated. Worsening of audiometrically assessed
cisplatin-associated hearing loss with time has been reported in
childhood cancer survivors43,44 but has not been longitudinally
studied in survivors of adult-onset cancer to our knowledge. The
effect of cumulative cisplatin dose on hearing loss in our cross-
sectional investigation remained statistically significant for many
decades (P , .001), although the effect of increasing age was even
stronger. Because higher frequencies are also disproportionately
affected by age-related hearing loss, it will be critical to evaluate the
extent to which survivors of adult-onset cancer given cisplatin-
based chemotherapy may experience accelerated age-related sen-
sory deficits.
Tinnitus
Tinnitus was significantly associated with impaired hearing
at all frequencies, including 10 and 12 kHz, and reflects neural
changes in the brain’s central auditory system.45,46 Hearing loss
perturbs normal input to this area, a mismatch between excit-
atory and inhibitory networks occurs, and neurons underlying
sound perception become abnormally activated, even without
external stimulation. In some patients, tinnitus becomes de-
bilitating as a sensory, anxiety-producing, and communication
deficit.47 Few treatments are effective, with most relying on
behavioral modification.47
Noise Damage
The presence of noise notches in audiograms has not been
previously evaluated in cancer survivors given cisplatin6,10,11 or
cranial radiotherapy.4,7-9 The proportion (10%) of our patients
with audiograms suggestive of noise damage is comparable to, or
slightly less than, normative data assembled by the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, which reports that 17% of adults
(20 to 69 years) demonstrate permanent noise-induced hearing
damage.48 Our slightly lower prevalence may reflect the younger
age distribution compared with population norms.
Conductive Hearing Loss (middle ear deficits)
The prevalence of conductive hearing loss is approxi-
mately 8% in adults without cancer31,32,49 and generally attributed
to infection- or treatment- or age-related damage to sound
conduction mechanisms.50 An explanation for the increased

 prevalence we observed is not readily apparent and, as expected,

Comment
Strengths of our study include large numbers of patients,
detailed treatment data, thorough hearing evaluations, adjust-
ments for age-related hearing loss, and consideration of co-
variates. Our quantitative assessment of cumulative cisplatin
dose and frequency-specific hearing loss is not confounded by
vincristine6,10,11 or cranial radiotherapy.4,7-9 Although pediatric
investigations of cisplatin-induced hearing loss21-23,51,52 have
yielded valuable perspective on classification approaches, pediatric
scales do not take into account age-related hearing loss. To adjust
for this effect, we not only included age in multivariate analyses
but also compared hearing thresholds with age-matched norma-
tive data, because as in previous studies of ototoxicity in adult-
onset cancer survivors, baseline hearing measures were not
available.6,8,9,53 Because suitable data were unavailable for a North
American cohort, we used normative data from a National In-
stitutes of Health–sponsored study of 40,541 Norwegian men (97%
white).32 Although we found expected relationships between
higher cisplatin dose and assignment to worse age-matched
hearing quartiles, we were not able to adjust for potentially dif-
fering distributions of hypertension, smoking, and other potential
confounders.54 Any differences, however, are unlikely to materially
affect our conclusions.
Cancer Survivor Plans and Future Research
Although follow-up hearing assessment guidelines exist for
children given cisplatin-based chemotherapy,51 we found no
similar recommendations for adult-onset cancer survivors. For
children, a complete audiological evaluation at entry into long-
term follow-up is recommended by the Children’s Oncology
Group,51 with annual testing if hearing loss is detected or as
recommended by an audiologist, as well as yearly questioning
about hearing status. Similarly, for adult-onset cancer survivors
after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, our findings suggest that
health care providers should at a minimum annually query pa-
tients about hearing status, consulting with audiologists as in-
dicated. Patients should also be urged to avoid noise exposure,
ototoxic drugs, and other factors that may further damage hear-
ing. As recommended by national regulatory agencies for the
general population,55,56 patients should be advised to wear hearing
protection in noisy environments and take advantage of new,
digital hearing aids and other innovative auditory therapies that are
emerging.57 Given the significant relationship we found between
hypertension and hearing loss and reported in other studies for
tobacco use,10,11 health care providers should monitor blood
pressure and encourage smoking cessation.
Because alterations in the highly successful GCT regimens
are unlikely, our results point to the importance of ongoing re-
search aimed at the identification of genetic variants associated
with cisplatin-related ototoxicity.58 It is possible that genomic
analysis may be able to eventually identify patients with newly
diagnosed testicular cancer susceptible to ototoxicity. These
findings could affect decisions with regard to the administration
of adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk clinical stage I disease or
adjuvant chemotherapy after initial orchiectomy and retroperi-
toneal lymph node dissection with positive lymph nodes to
prevent recurrence.59,60
