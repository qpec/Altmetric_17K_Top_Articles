IMPORTANCE Endovascular thrombectomy with second-generation devices is beneficial for
patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusions. Delineation of the
association of treatment time with outcomes would help to guide implementation.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the period in which endovascular thrombectomy is associated
with benefit, and the extent to which treatment delay is related to functional outcomes,
mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Demographic, clinical, and brain imaging data as well as
functional and radiologic outcomes were pooled from randomized phase 3 trials involving
stent retrievers or other second-generation devices in a peer-reviewed publication (by July 1,
2016). The identified 5 trials enrolled patients at 89 international sites.
EXPOSURES Endovascular thrombectomy plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone;
time to treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was degree of disability (mRS range,
0-6; lower scores indicating less disability) at 3 months, analyzed with the common odds
ratio (cOR) to detect ordinal shift in the distribution of disability over the range of the mRS;
secondary outcomes included functional independence at 3 months, mortality by 3 months,
and symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation.
RESULTS Among all 1287 patients (endovascular thrombectomy + medical therapy [n = 634];
medical therapy alone [n = 653]) enrolled in the 5 trials (mean age, 66.5 years [SD, 13.1]; women,
47.0%), time from symptom onset to randomization was 196 minutes (IQR, 142 to 267). Among
the endovascular group, symptom onset to arterial puncture was 238 minutes (IQR, 180 to 302)
and symptom onset to reperfusion was 286 minutes (IQR, 215 to 363). At 90 days, the mean
mRS score was 2.9 (95% CI, 2.7 to 3.1) in the endovascular group and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.5 to 3.8) in
the medical therapy group. The odds of better disability outcomes at 90 days (mRS scale
distribution) with the endovascular group declined with longer time from symptom onset to
arterial puncture: cOR at 3 hours, 2.79 (95% CI, 1.96 to 3.98), absolute risk difference (ARD) for
lower disability scores, 39.2%; cOR at 6 hours, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.30 to 3.00), ARD, 30.2%; cOR at
8 hours,1.57 (95% CI, 0.86 to 2.88), ARD, 15.7%; retaining statistical significance through 7 hours
and 18 minutes. Among 390 patients who achieved substantial reperfusion with endovascular
thrombectomy, each 1-hour delay to reperfusion was associated with a less favorable degree of
disability (cOR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93]; ARD, −6.7%) and less functional independence
(OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.92], ARD, −5.2% [95% CI, −8.3% to −2.1%]), but no change in
mortality (OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.34]; ARD, 1.5% [95% CI, −0.9% to 4.2%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this individual patient data meta-analysis of patients with
large-vessel ischemic stroke, earlier treatment with endovascular thrombectomy + medical
therapy compared with medical therapy alone was associated with lower degrees of disability
at 3 months. Benefit became nonsignificant after 7.3 hours.

F
ive randomized trials have demonstrated the benefit of
second-generation endovascular recanalization thera-
pies (primarily stent retrievers) over medical therapy
alone among patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-
vessel occlusions.1-6 However, uncertainties remain about the
benefit and risk of endovascular intervention when under-
taken more than 6 hours
after symptom onset as
wellasthedegreetowhich
benefit varies with time
within the first 6 hours af-
ter symptom onset. In ad-
dition, evaluation of the
workflowspeedsachieved
in the trials could guide
timetargetsforqualityim-
provementinclinicalpractice.Nationalguidelinesandconsen-
sus statements in the United States, Europe, and Canada rec-
ommend endovascular recanalization up until 6 hours after
symptom onset, but thrombectomy devices are cleared by the
US Food and Drug Administration for use up to 8 hours after
symptom onset, and the Canadian guidelines additionally rec-
ommendthrombectomyforselectedpatientsupto12hoursaf-
ter symptom onset.7-9
To address these uncertainties regarding temporal as-
pects of endovascular recanalization therapy, the investiga-
torsfromthe5trialsagreedtopooltheirindividualpatientdata
for analysis. The objectives of this pooled analysis were to de-
lineate the period in which endovascular thrombectomy is as-
sociated with benefit and to investigate the extent to which
treatment delay is related to the association of endovascular
intervention with functional outcomes, mortality, and symp-
tomatic intracranial hemorrhage, with greater power and pre-
cision than achievable in analyses of individual trials.10-13
Methods
Study Design and Inclusion Criteria
A detailed description of the analytic approach is provided in
the statistical analysis plan (Supplement 1). The study inves-
tigators established the Highly Effective Reperfusion Evalu-
ated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials (HERMES) col-
laboration to undertake meta-analysis of pooled individual
patient data. The collaboration included all randomized phase
3 trials in which stent retrievers or other second-generation de-
vices were used in the majority of endovascular interven-
tions for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and for which a
peer-reviewed, complete primary results manuscript was pub-
lished by July 1, 2016. PubMed search and inquiry among col-
laborators and colleagues was performed to confirm that all
eligible trials were included (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).14,15
Comparative design features of the contributing trials have
been described.6 All included trials enrolled patients with eth-
ics approval from the local institutional boards at participat-
ingsites.Thetrialsenrolledpatientsusingprospective(4trials)
or prospective and deferred (1 trial) written informed consent
from patients or their legally authorized representatives.
Outcomes
Two approaches were used to analyze the association be-
tweentreatmenttimeandoutcomes:(1)theassociationoftime
with differences in outcome between treatment strategies was
analyzed in an intention-to-treat manner, comparing pa-
tients allocated to treatment with endovascular thrombec-
tomy + medical therapy (endovascular group) vs patients al-
located to medical therapy alone (medical therapy group);
(2) the association between time and outcome with substan-
tial endovascular reperfusion was analyzed in the subset of en-
dovascular group patients with modified Thrombolysis in
Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) scale scores of 2b or 3.16
Efficacy outcomes analyzed at 3 months were (1) degree of
disability, assessed across 6 levels of the modified Rankin Scale
(mRS), with ranks 5 and 6 combined into a single worst out-
comerank;(2)functionalindependence,definedasmRSscores
of0through2;and(3)excellentoutcome,definedasmRSscore
of 0 through 1. Safety outcomes evaluated were 90-day mor-
tality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours,
and radiologic major intracerebral parenchymal hematoma
within36hours.Symptomaticintracranialhemorrhagewasclas-
sified according to the definitions of symptomatic intracranial
hemorrhage used in each trial. Major parenchymal hematoma
was defined as parenchymal hematoma type 2.17
Statistical Analysis
A detailed description of the analytic approach is provided in
the statistical analysis plan, which was modified from the pre-
analysis document to incorporate additional analyses based on
the initial findings (eAppendix in Supplement 1). Briefly, prob-
abilityofeachoutcomeasafunctionoftimewasanalyzedusing
mixed-method ordinal logistic regression for ordinal out-
comes and mixed-method binary logistic regression for binary
outcomes, with trial and trial-by-treatment interaction as ran-
dom-effects variables. In the main analyses, models were con-
structed of the linear dependence of the log odds of a particu-
lar outcome on allocation to endovascular vs medical therapy
groups and time interval (a linear variable). For models includ-
ing both randomized groups, the interaction of time and treat-
ment assignment was also included. In addition to these linear
models, exploratory nonlinear models were constructed of the
relationsofoutcomeswithtimetoreperfusionbyanalyzingeach
cOR common odds ratio
ICA internal carotid artery
IV tPA intravenous tissue

MCA middle cerebral artery
mRS modified Rankin Scale
mTICI modified Thrombolysis

Key Points
Question What is the relation between time to treatment and
outcome from endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for acute
ischemic stroke?
Findings In this meta-analysis of pooled individual patient data
from 1287 adults in 5 randomized trials, compared with medical
therapy alone, thrombectomy up to 7.3 hours after symptom
onset was associated with improved outcomes. Rates of functional
independence after thrombectomy were 64% with reperfusion at
3 hours vs 46% with reperfusion at 8 hours.
Meaning In acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion,
endovascular mechanical thrombectomy should be initiated as
soon as possible within the first 7 hours after symptom onset.

modified Rankin Scale (mRS) cut point in 6 separate, binary
mixed-method logistic regression models, using a locally
weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) regression tech-
nique. The common odds ratio (cOR) of the ordinal shift in the
distribution of disability over the range of the mRS was the pri-
mary effect measure estimated from these models. The pro-
portion of patients having better outcome by 1 or more disabil-
ity levels on the mRS (absolute risk difference) was calculated
by averaging values derived using the algorithmic joint out-
come table and permutation test methods.18,19
For binary outcomes, absolute risk differences were cal-
culated as differences of predicted proportions from logistic
regression models. Variables included in adjusted analyses
were age (a linear variable), sex (binary variable), baseline
stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
[NIHSS] score), target occlusion location (a 3-level categori-
cal variable—internal carotid artery [ICA], M1 middle cerebral
artery [MCA], M2 MCA), entry Alberta Stroke Program Early
Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS; linear variable), and
pretreatment intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA [alteplase]; binary variable). Race/ethnicity was not in-
cluded both because collection of race data was legally pro-
hibited in some countries where studies were performed and
because race/ethnicity is not a known major independent de-
terminant of outcome from large-vessel ischemic stroke.
In all 5 trials, all patients eligible for IV tPA received it; only
patientswithcontraindicationstoIVtPAdidnotreceiveit.Sub-
groups analyzed included IV tPA–treated vs IV tPA–ineligible
patients, target occlusion location, extent of cerebral infarc-
tion at entry on the ASPECTS scale, and mode of arrival (direct
from out-of-hospital setting to endovascular hospital [direct
arrival patients] vs interhospital transfer from outside initial
receiving hospital [transfer patients]).
An independent statistician collated, cleaned, and merged
the data. A minimum data set was designed by the collabora-
tive authors and retrieved by each study statistician and sub-
mitted to the independent statistician. Data definitions were
harmonized, and when data queries arose, detailed informa-
tion was sought from each trials’data center and statistician.
Additional data checking (eg, for sequence generation, data
consistency, and completeness) was performed by compar-
ing independent analysis of the acquired data to published re-
sults and to unpublished summaries provided by the collab-
orative authors. Final analyses were performed on the collated
and merged data set after the above steps.
For comparisons of treatment groups, time intervals ana-
lyzed included (1) symptom onset to randomization; (2) symp-
tom onset to expected arterial puncture; (3) arrival at the emer-
gency department door to randomization; and (4) arrival at the
emergency department door to expected arterial puncture.
Symptom onset time was time the patient was last known to be
well. Symptom onset–to–expected arterial puncture time was
derived by adding to the symptom onset–to-randomization
value for each patient in both the endovascular and med-
ical therapy groups (the study mean for the time from random-
ization to arterial puncture of the trial in which they partici-
pated). Symptom onset–to–expected arterial puncture time
was considered the lead analytic time interval, as it is the
time interval used in national guidelines for treatment
recommendations.7-9 For analysis of the association with out-
come of time of revascularization among the subset endovas-
cular group patients achieving substantial reperfusion (mTICI
score of 2b or 3), the primary time interval analyzed was symp-
tom onset to actual substantial reperfusion. Analyses of symp-
tom onset–to–treatment event time intervals always included
both direct arrival and transfer patients. Analyses of emer-
gencydepartmentdoor–to–treatmenteventtimeintervalswere
confined to direct arrival patients (because transfer patients,
having undergone workup at outside facilities, often had para-
doxical short emergency department door–to–treatment event
and long symptom onset–to–treatment event times.)
All effect size estimates were provided with their 95% CIs;
P values were 2-sided with values less than .05 considered sta-
tistically significant, without adjustment for multiple com-
parisons. Statistical analyses were performed in SAS (SAS In-
stitute), version 9.3. Graphical output was obtained from R
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing), version 3.2.
Results
The systematic search identified 5 trials enrolling 1287 par-
ticipants (eTable 1-2 and eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Data from
all patients in all trials were included; across all possible time
points and outcomes, data availability was 99.2% (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2). Formal assessment of trial quality was high for
all 5 trials, although potential sources of bias included blind-
ing of outcome raters but not participants in all and early stop-
ping due to overwhelming efficacy in 4 trials (eTable 5 in
Supplement 2).
Overall, 634 participants were assigned to the endovas-
cular group and 653 participants to the medical therapy group.
Characteristics of patients in each treatment group and in dif-
ferent time windows are shown in Table 1. The treatment
groups were well matched with respect to age, sex, baseline
stroke severity, site of target occlusion, and time to random-
ization (eTable 6 in Supplement 2). Although all trials admin-
istered IV tPA to all tPA-eligible patients in both treatment
groups, randomized assignment resulted in slightly less fre-
quent IV tPA use in the endovascular group than in the medi-
cal therapy group (83% for the endovascular group vs 87% for
the medical therapy group, P = .04). The median time from
symptom onset to randomization was 196 minutes (IQR, 142-
267; full range, 37-713) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Endovascular intervention was associated with a substan-
tially lower degree of patient disability at 3 months, with mRS
scores of 2.9 (95% CI, 2.7-3.1) in the endovascular group and 3.6
(95% CI, 3.5-3.8) in the medical therapy group. In the endovas-
cular group, the cOR of a less-disabled outcome with throm-
bectomy was 2.49 (95% CI, 1.76-3.53); absolute risk difference
(ARD), 38.1% (P < .001), with earlier treatment associated with
greater magnitude of benefit (Table 2, Figure 1, and eTables 7-8
and eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). Considering all mRS disability
levels concurrently, increasing delays were associated with
higher levels of disability among patients in the endovascular
groupandtherewasnochangeovertimeinthemedicaltherapy

Treatment effect was not significantly modified by the
symptom onset–to–emergency department arrival time inter-
val. However, pronounced treatment effect modification was
observed with time intervals beginning from emergency-
department arrival (Table 2). Excellent outcome (mRS 0-1),
symptomatic hemorrhage, and major parenchymal hema-
toma did not show interactions of time with treatment group
(eTable 9 and eFigure 4 in Supplement 2).
Among the 634 patients randomized to the endovascular
group, arterial puncture was performed in 607 (95.7%) and
thrombectomy intervention in 563 (88.8%). The most com-
mon reason for nonintervention was interval resolution of tar-
get occlusion (eTable 10 in Supplement 2). Among the 549 pa-
tients who underwent an endovascular thrombectomy
interventionandhadresultingmTICIscoresdocumented,sub-
stantial reperfusion was achieved in 390 (71.0%). Among the
607 patients who had an arterial access puncture, the median
time from symptom onset to arterial puncture was 238 min-
utes (IQR, 180-302) and from symptom onset to reperfusion
301 minutes (IQR, 226-384) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Among the endovascular group patients in whom sub-
stantial reperfusion was achieved, delay in symptom symp-
tom onset–to-reperfusion times was associated with in-
creased levels of 3-month disability (Figure 2; eTable 11 and
eFigure 5 in Supplement 2). Considering outcome distribu-
tions across all mRS health states, for every 9-minute delay in
symptom symptom onset–to–substantial endovascular rep-
erfusion time, 1 of every 100 treated patients had a worse dis-
ability outcome (higher score by 1 or more levels on the mRS).
The probability of functional independence (mRS 0-2) at
3 months declined from 64.1% with symptom onset–
to-reperfusion time of 180 minutes to 46.1% with symptom
onset–to-reperfusion time of 480 minutes (Figure 2). The
associations of time delay with poorer outcomes were

mRS indicates modified Rankin Scale. Time was analyzed as a continuous
variable. Data were adjusted for age, sex, baseline stroke severity (National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), target occlusion location, and concomitant
intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. A, The 6-level mRS combined ranks 5
and 6 into a single worst outcome rank. The solid curve indicates the best linear
fit between the common odds ratio for improved outcome over the 6-level
mRS. The dashed curves indicate 95% CIs. The P value for interaction was .07.
The lower bound of the 95% CI crosses 1.0 at 438 minutes (vertical blue dashed
line). When the 7-level mRS was analyzed, with rank 5 considered a better
outcome than rank 6, the lower bound of the 95% CI crossed 1.0 at 418
minutes. B, Upper solid line of each colored band indicates outcome rate in the
endovascular thrombectomy group; lower dashed line of each band indicates
outcome rate in the medical care only group. The widths of the colored bands
indicate the absolute differences between the endovascular thrombectomy and
medical therapy groups for that mRS cut point at each time point. Categories
are cumulative, so that mRS 0-3 includes all patients with outcomes of mRS 0-3.
For example, at the symptom onset to expected arterial puncture time of 300
minutes, the x intercepts indicate outcome rates (mRS 0: 8.3% for the
endovascular thrombectomy group vs 4.3% for the medical therapy group; mRS
0-1: 22.9% for the endovascular thrombectomy group vs 12.9% for the medical
therapy group; mRS 0-2: 43.1% for the endovascular thrombectomy group vs
28.2% for the medical therapy group; mRS 0-3: 62.7% for the endovascular
thrombectomy group vs 47.3% for the medical therapy group; mRS 0-4: 82.4%
for the endovascular thrombectomy group vs 72.0% for the medical therapy

(Figure 3). Rates of mortality, symptomatic intracranial hem-
orrhage, and major parenchymal hematoma did not signifi-
cantly change with longer delay to reperfusion (eTable 13 in
Supplement 2).

contrast, rates of independent outcome declined more steeply
in patients treated with IV tPA vs tPA-ineligible patients (7.4%
per hour [95% CI, 3.8% to 10.9%] for patients treated with IV
tPA vs 3.4% [95% CI, −0.5% to 7.3%] for tPA-ineligible pa-
tients, P = .047).
Workflowtimeintervalsdifferedbetweendirectarrivalpa-
tients and transfer patients (eTable 11 and eFigure 8 in
Supplement 2). Transfer patients had faster processes of care
at the endovascular hospital than direct arrival patients, with
emergency department door–to–arterial puncture times of 81
minutes (IQR, 58-105) for transfer patients vs 116 minutes (IQR,
83-160) for direct arrival patients, P < .001. But the longer
symptom onset to arrival times (207 minutes [IQR, 160-256]
for transfer patients vs 65 minutes [IQR, 44-116] for direct ar-
rival patients, P < .001) resulted in overall longer symptom
onset–to-randomization intervals (260 minutes [IQR, 215-
310] for transfer patients vs 165 minutes [IQR, 125-226] for di-
rect arrival patients, P < .001). Considering all endovascular
group patients, high proportions (62%-81%) were treated
within the time intervals recommended by multispecialty
guidelines in effect at the time of study conduct,20 but low pro-
portions (4%-13%) were treated within more recently promul-
gated “ideal” target intervals (eTable 14 in Supplement 2).21
Discussion
This study provides additional evidence regarding the asso-
ciation between treatment time and the benefit of endovas-
cular reperfusion. Compared with best medical therapy alone,
endovascular thrombectomy therapy was associated with im-
proved outcomes when procedure start (arterial puncture)
could be performed within the first 7.3 hours after symptom
onset among patients meeting the brain imaging entry crite-
ria for inclusion in these randomized trials. Moreover, within
this period, functional outcomes were better the sooner after
symptom onset that endovascular reperfusion was achieved,
emphasizing the importance of programs to enhance patient
awareness, out-of-hospital care, and in-hospital manage-
ment to shorten symptom onset–to-treatment times.
The magnitude of the association between time to treat-
mentandoutcomewasclinicallymeaningful.Basedonthecur-
rent study, and assuming the findings are generalizable to the
population of patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-
vessel occlusion, among every 1000 patients achieving sub-
stantial endovascular reperfusion, for every 15-minute faster
emergency department door–to-reperfusion time, an esti-
mated 39 patients would have a less-disabled outcome at 3
months, including 25 more who would achieve functional in-
dependence (mRS 0-2). The findings that in-hospital pro-
cesses of care are directly associated with improved func-
tional outcome is noteworthy. In addition to faster time from
emergency department door to reperfusion, faster time from
brain imaging to reperfusion was associated with better
3-month functional outcomes. These findings are largely

consistent with those of prior endovascular intervention ob-
servational cohorts and trials22-24 and of studies of intrave-
nous thrombolysis.25,26
Use of brain imaging to exclude patients with a large core
of permanently infarcted brain tissue in the trials in this pooled
analysis may have influenced the strength of the association
between symptom onset-to-randomization and symptom
onset–to-reperfusion times and outcomes. Four of the 5 trials
formally excluded patients with large ischemic cores evident
on initial brain imaging from study participation.2-5 The fifth
trial required investigator and treating physician uncertainty
regardingpatientpotentialtobenefitfromtherapy,1whichmay
have resulted in informal exclusion of some patients with large
cores. In the current study, patients with moderate infarct core
volumes (ASPECT score, 7-8) had a shallower decline in ben-
efit with longer symptom onset–to-reperfusion than patients
with minor infarct core volumes (ASPECT score, 9-10). The ex-
clusion of patients with even larger cores from the trials likely
attenuated the relationship between symptom onset–to-
reperfusion time and frequency of good functional out-
comes.Similarly,inapopulationwithmorepatientswithlarge,
already-established infarcts, symptom onset–to-reperfusion
time would likely have greater association with mortality than
in the trials pooled in this study.24
A time-by–treatment group interaction was observed for
the interval from emergency department arrival to random-
ization, but not from symptom onset to emergency depart-
ment arrival. There are several possible reasons the stronger
association of time intervals after arrival with outcome. One
is the application of study entry criteria after emergency
department arrival. By eliminating patients with clinical fea-
tures that indicated a very mild ischemic injury, and clinical
and brain imaging features that indicated an advanced and
extensive injury, the entry criteria likely filtered out patients
who experienced very slow or very fast progression during
the symptom onset–to-emergency department door period.
A second likely source is differential reliability of docu-
mented times for stroke onset vs emergency department
arrival. Time of emergency department arrival is generally
accurately documented in patient medical records. In con-
trast, the time of stroke onset (last known well) is often
imprecisely determined or documented.27 In some patients,
symptom onset occurs during sleep and the actual symptom
onset time is not known. In others, the neurologic deficit
may render the patient unable to accurately observe or report
the time of symptom onset. A third possibility is physiologi-
cal. Human cerebral ischemic injury may follow an exponen-
tial or sigmoid growth trajectory, with more rapid progres-
sion at intermediate after–symptom onset times than early
after–symptom onset times. Available human serial brain
imaging studies have not strongly suggested that the infarct
growth curve has a sigmoid shape but have been relatively
small and underpowered.28,29
Patient characteristics also were related to the associa-
tion of symptom onset–to-reperfusion time with outcomes.
At all symptom onset–to-reperfusion times, absolute rates of
functional independence at 3 months were higher for
patients younger than 80 years than those 80 years and
older, although both declined at a similar pace with longer
treatment intervals. Absolute rates were also higher at all
time points (with parallel declines with longer symptom
onset–to-reperfusion time) for patients with moderate-
presenting neurologic deficits (NIHSS score, 10-19) compared
with severe (NIHSS score, ≥20). In contrast, although longer
symptom onset–to-reperfusion times were associated with a
lower frequency of functional independence for M1 MCA
occlusions, these longer times tended not to be associated
with functional independence rates for ICA occlusions. ICA
occlusions had relatively modest rates of functional indepen-
dence at all analyzed symptom onset–to-reperfusion inter-
vals. Potentially, patients with ICA occlusions who were
prone to rapid infarct progression were excluded from the
studies by the requirement for small or moderate core infarct
size at entry. Patients receiving IV tPA had steeper declines in
functional independence with longer symptom onset–to-
reperfusion times than tPA-ineligible patients. These findings
may reflect that the comorbidities constituting contraindica-
tions to tPA in the tPA-ineligible patients limited their ability
to achieve high functional independence rates, even when
reperfusion occurred early.
The results of this study reinforce guideline recommen-
dations to pursue endovascular treatment when arterial punc-
ture can be initiated within 6 hours of symptom onset,7-9 and
provide evidence that potentially supports strengthening of
recommendations for treatment from 6 through 7.3 hours af-
ter symptom onset. Although point estimates suggested that
benefitmaycontinuetoaccrueuptoandbeyond8hours,there
wereinsufficientnumbersofpatientsintheextendedtimewin-
dowtoprovidefirminsights.Theseobservationsunderlinethe
importance of enrollment of brain imaging–selected patients
in ongoing randomized trials evaluating endovascular reper-
fusion patients in longer time windows (NCT02142283,
NCT02586415).
The findings also provide data useful for the refinement
of guidelines on speed-of-care processes in patients undergo-
ingendovascularreperfusion.Theprocesstimeintervalsinthe
pooled trial data set fall between the extremely lenient cur-
rent multispecialty recommendations and extremely strin-
gent ideal recommendations.20,21 These time windows repre-
sent a good foundation upon which to further improve in
practice as centers become proficient at routinely performing
endovascular therapies and the need to obtain research-
informed consent is no longer present. For continuous qual-
ity improvement programs, reasonable time targets for care
processes might be those near the best 25th percentile in the
pooledtrialdatabase,whichwouldinclude50minutesforbrain
imaging–to–arterial puncture time, 75 minutes for emer-
gencydepartmentdoor–to–arterialpuncturetime,and110min-
utes for emergency department door–to-reperfusion time.
Several potential limitations should be considered in in-
terpreting the results of this study. First, differences in entry
criteria and patient characteristics among the trials is a source
of potential bias; random-effects models were used to miti-
gate potential confounding. Second, several different time in-
tervals in the delivery of endovascular thrombectomy are po-
tentially relevant when analyzing treatment delay and

treatment group interaction, including symptom onset to ran-
domization, symptom onset to expected procedure start, and
symptom onset to expected reperfusion. The primary analy-
sis used the time interval that is the focus of national guide-
line recommendations, symptom onset to expected arterial
puncture, and results for other intervals were also analyzed.7-9
Third, functional outcomes were assessed at 3 months. Some
further improvement may occur subsequently, especially
among patients with more severe strokes. However, studies
have shown that functional status at 3 months correlates well
with functional status at 1 year.30 Fourth, the definition of
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage varied in minor ways
across studies; to mitigate this, a uniform radiologic variable
was also examined—major parenchymal hematoma. Fifth, the
resultsofthisstudyarenotgeneralizabletopatientswhowould
not meet the entry criteria of the component trials. However,
the pooled patients were treated at many centers in multiple
countries on 4 continents, suggesting wide applicability.
Conclusions
In this individual patient data meta-analysis of 5 randomized
clinical trials of patients with large-vessel ischemic stroke, ear-
lier treatment with endovascular thrombectomy + medical
therapy compared with medical therapy alone was associ-
ated with lower degrees of disability at 3 months. Benefit was
greatest with time from symptom onset to arterial puncture
for thrombectomy of under 2 hours and became nonsignifi-
cant after 7.3 hours.
