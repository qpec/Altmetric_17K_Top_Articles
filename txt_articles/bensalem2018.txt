Abstract  
Polyphenols are promising nutritional bioactives exhibiting beneficial effect on age-related 
cognitive decline. The present study evaluated the effect of a polyphenol-rich extract from 
grape and blueberry (PEGB) on memory of healthy elderly subjects (60-70 years-old). A 
bicentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 215 
volunteers receiving 600 mg/day of PEGB (containing 258 mg flavonoids) or a placebo for 6 
months. The primary outcome was the CANTAB Paired Associate Learning (PAL), a 
visuospatial learning and episodic memory test. Secondary outcomes included verbal episodic 
and recognition memory (VRM) and working memory (SSP). There was no significant effect 
of PEGB on the PAL on the whole cohort. Yet, PEGB supplementation improved VRM free 
recall. Stratifying the cohort in quartiles based on PAL at baseline revealed a subgroup with 
advanced cognitive decline (decliners) who responded positively to the PEGB. In this group, 
PEGB consumption was also associated with a better VRM delayed recognition. In addition 
to a lower polyphenol consumption, the urine metabolomic profile of decliners revealed that 
they excreted more metabolites. Urinary concentrations of specific flavan-3-ols metabolites 
were associated, at the end of the intervention, with the memory improvements. Our study 
demonstrates that PEGB improves age-related episodic memory decline in individuals with 
the highest cognitive impairments.

Introduction 
In recent years, the demographic weight of elderly has increased significantly in most 
industrialized countries. This segment of the population is estimated to reach up to 2 billion in 
2050 (1). Ageing is inexorably accompanied by a more or less severe age-related cognitive 
decline (ARCD), defined as a non-pathological, yet significant decrease in elementary and 
advanced mental abilities (2, 3). It usually develops progressively from midlife onward 
(between 35 and 65 years) (4). Among cognitive impairments, memory loss is one of the most 
serious health concerns for elderly (2, 3). Accordingly, strategies to prevent, delay, or slow-
down ARCD is becoming a critical issue to improve the quality of life of elderly and attenuate 
the associated social and economic burden. 
Epidemiological studies have highlighted the relationship between nutritional habits/status 
and cognitive functions and/or dementia prevalence (5-9). Particularly, the protective effects 
of phenolic compounds present in fruit and vegetables have been outlined (10). Polyphenols 
are phytochemicals belonging to four main classes based on their chemical structure: 
flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes and lignans (11). Long-term berries or flavonoid intake 
(10 or 13 years) has previously been associated with slower rates of cognitive decline and 
better cognitive function in elderly (5, 12-15). 
Preclinical and clinical studies have confirmed these observations. For instance, the 
consumption of polyphenol-rich berries, berry extracts, or isolated flavonoids (16), was found 
to reduce ARCD in rodents (10). These polyphenols appear to directly improve synaptic and 
brain plasticity, but may also have indirect systemic effects (17) with favorable consequences 
on inflammation and neurobiological processes associated with learning and memory (10, 18-
20).

Moreover, two randomized clinical trials performed with elderly with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) consuming polyphenol-rich grape or blueberry juices, have demonstrated 
an improvement of spatial and verbal memory performances (21-23). More recently, different 
results have been published on the effects of blueberries on working memory. A blueberry 
supplementation was shown to be not associated with a working memory improvement in 
MCI subjects, even though it induced a neural activation during the memory task (24). While, 
in healthy older adults, the supplementation improved this type of memory (25). 
Another dietary intervention with blueberry has shown that a easily achievable quantity of this 
berries into the diets of older adults can improve verbal learning and memory (26).  
While anthocyanins have been extensively studied for their beneficial effect on cognition (27-
29), evidences also lead to an important effect of flavanols and flavonols on cognitive decline 
(30-34). To test this hypothesis, the grape and blueberry extract (PEGB) was elaborated to be 
rich in these latter molecular species. 
We previously observed in a murine model that PEGB prevented age-related spatial memory 
deficits (35). This effect was also observed in 3xTg-AD mice, a model of Alzheimer’s 
disease, in which PEGB prevented the decrease in recognition memory (36). This specific 
blend was formulated to provide high amount of grape and blueberry low-molecular-weight 
polyphenols. It is mainly constituted of flavan-3-ols, particularly monomeric (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin, provided by grape extract and flavonols (as quercetin), anthocyanins and 
chlorogenic acid provided by blueberry marc extract. Indeed, a study conducted in AD 
transgenic mice showed that, following oral administration of either grape-derived catechin 
and epicatechin in monomeric forms or proanthocyanidin (PAC) polymers, only monomeric 
forms were able to improve cognitive function and only monomer metabolites were able to 
selectively reach and accumulate in the brain. Furthermore, it was reported that one of the 
epicatechin metabolites identified in the brain following monomer administration, promotes

basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation at physiologically relevant 
concentrations in hippocampus slices (37). 
The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of a 6-month dietary supplementation 
with PEGB on memory of healthy elderly subjects, evaluated with the Cambridge 
Neuropsychological 
Test 
Automated 
Battery 
(CANTAB). 
Additionally, 
urinary 
concentrations of PEGB phenolic metabolites were determined using a targeted metabolomics 
approach and investigated for statistical correlations with cognitive improvement. 
Methods 
Participants 
At the beginning of the study, 215 male and female healthy subjects, aged between 60-70 
years and with a body mass index (BMI) between 20-30 were enrolled. Their Mini Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) score was 26 < MMSE score ≤ 29. Logical memory subtest of the 
Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) (16-69 years battery) sub-scores was used to identify 
individuals with a cognitive function decline and avoid subjects with hypermnesia (cut-offs 
used for inclusion: < 29 for the immediate recall score and < 16 for the delayed recall score). 
To minimize the confounding effect of a high dietary consumption of polyphenols, inclusion 
criteria enabling to recruit a study population quite homogeneous in term of usual dietary 
intake of polyphenols were defined (red fruits ≤ 2 servings per week; tea consumption ≤ 1 cup 
per day; dark chocolate (≥ 70% cocoa) ≤ 140 g per week). As well, volunteers with high 
intake of omega-3 fatty acids (more than 3 servings per week of omega-3 fatty acids rich 
foods such as fish, algae,…) were not eligible. Subjects were requested not to change their 
dietary habits during the study. Before entry into the study, subjects declared being capable 
and willing to comply with the protocol and gave their written informed consent. Subjects

with the following criteria were not eligible for the study: those consuming food supplement 
likely to have an effect on memory and especially providing polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids 
or multivitamin; those who usually consumed at least one of these food supplements, but who 
agree to stop during their whole study participation were accepted under the condition of a 
washout period of 4 weeks before baseline visit (V1); those with depressive disorder or other 
psychiatric disorders (including schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or dementia), under 
anti-depressant treatment or who had stopped less than 3 months before the experiment, 
undergoing neuroleptic treatment, under medication to treat symptoms of AD or dementia, 
with diabetes, cardiovascular disease or history (except subjects with medicated controlled 
blood pressure for 3 months), under blood thinner or anticoagulant treatment or treatment that 
may interfere with the assessed parameters, history of moderate to severe traumatic brain 
injury and / or intracranial surgery;  those with important medical history within the previous 
year or still ongoing (such as cancer), general anesthesia in the last 6 months or planned in the 
next 6 months, significant alcohol consumption (more than 2 glasses per day), with 
unbalanced or restrictive diet, documented food allergy(ies), especially to one of the 
components of the study product, uncorrected visual or auditory dysfunction, with high level 
of physical activity (more than 5 hours per week). Individuals with psychological or linguistic 
incapability to sign the informed consent were also excluded from the study.  
Ethics committees gave a positive agreement for implementation of the study. Both French 
and Canadian Health Authorities have authorized the study. This study was carried out in 
accordance with the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards for the evaluation of medical 
devices and medicinal products (ICH topic 6), the Declaration of Helsinki and current French 
regulations (Code de Santé Publique (CSP), Titre II du livre Premier). The study was 
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, a registry of clinical trials, under identifier NCT02063646.

Procedures 
The study was a bicentric, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial. The study 
was divided in 3 visits at investigational sites and 2 follow-up calls. The subjects were seen 
for the pre-inclusion visit (V0), followed in the 2 to 4 next weeks by a baseline visit (V1), and 
finally an end-of-the-study visit (V2) 24 weeks after V1. The follow-up calls were made 8 and 
16 weeks after V1. All procedures were homogenized between the two investigational sites, 
located in France (BIOFORTIS, Saint-Herblain) and in Canada (Institute of Nutrition and 
Functional Foods (INAF), Laval University, Quebec). 
Subjects were randomized and assigned to receive either the active treatment, a polyphenol-
rich extract from grape (Vitis vinifera L.) and wild blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton.) 
(i.e. PEGB) (10, 36), or the placebo. Subjects consumed orally 2 capsules per day (one 
capsule at least 1 hour after breakfast and one capsule at least 1 hour after dinner) for 24 
weeks. Each active capsule contained 300 mg of PEGB, a unique formulation standardized in 
low-molecular-weight polyphenols: 42.8±2.8% of total flavonoids (flavan-3-ols, flavonols 
and anthocyanins) including 22.9±1.6% of flavan-3-ols monomers and 19.1±7.3% of 
oligomers (DP<5), 0.6±0.2% of flavonols (especially quercetin and glycosylated derivatives), 
0.13±0.04% of anthocyanins (especially malvidin 3-glucoside), 1.8±0.6% of phenolic acids 
(such as chlorogenic, gallic and ferulic acids); and 0.04±0.01% of stilbenes (resveratrol). The 
dose of PEGB was determined based on previous studies in rodents consuming this extract 
(10, 36) and on epidemiological studies referencing the usual consumption of polyphenols 
(38, 39). Two capsules of PEGB therefore provided 258±17 mg of flavonoids. Each placebo 
capsule contained 300 mg of pure maltodextrine (ref Maltrin® M100) providing no 
polyphenol. Both placebo and active capsules were formulated in a single batch and were

provided in opaque bottles. Capsule count was realized at end-of-the-study visit as a measure 
of compliance. 
The subjects were asked to fill out 3-day food diaries, once at the beginning and once at the 
end of the protocol, to estimate their dietary polyphenol consumption (and detect a significant 
variation during the study). Their mean daily dietary intake of polyphenols and flavonoids 
was quantified using Phenol-Explorer (http://phenol-explorer.eu/) and the USDA database for 
food products not available in Phenol-Explorer. It is noteworthy that in Phenol-Explorer as 
well as in the USDA database, proanthocyanidins are divided into five categories (dimers, 
trimers, 4-6mers, 7-10mers and polymers). 
Outcomes measurements 
Efficacy assessment of PEGB was performed by comparing cognitive performances after 24 
weeks of supplementation with those at baseline using the validated, reliable 
neuropsychological CANTAB battery (40, 41). The primary outcome was the change at week 
24 compared to baseline in the PAL total errors adjusted (PALTEA), a visuospatial learning 
and episodic memory test (parallel versions, 8 shapes) (42). Boxes are displayed on the screen 
and are “opened” in a randomised order. One or more of them will contain a pattern. The patterns are 
then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time and the participant must select the box in 
which the pattern was originally located. Parallel versions were used to minimize any potential 
ceiling effects (43). Secondary outcomes included the evaluation of episodic verbal recall 
memory using the VRM free recall (VRMFR) test (18 words), the verbal recognition memory 
immediate and delayed (20 min) using the VRM recognition (VRMR) test. The participant is 
shown a sequence of 18 words on screen one by one. The participant is then tasked with 
recalling the words, whilst a rater marks which ones they remembered. In the next phase, the 
participant is presented with two words, one from the original list and one distractor and is

asked to choose which one they have seen before, in a 2-force choice paradigm. The latter 
recognition phase is then repeated after a delay. The working memory was also evaluated in 
the Spatial Span (SSP) and the Reverse SSP tests. White squares are shown on the screen, 
some of which briefly change colour in a variable sequence. The participant must then select 
the boxes which changed colour in the same order that they were displayed by the computer 
(for the forward variant) or in the reverse order (for backward variant). The number of boxes 
in the sequence increases from two at the start of the test, to nine at the end and the sequence 
and colour are varied through the test. 
The order of test sequence remained constant across the two visits. CANTAB data were 
electronically collected and processed. 
The protocol included a cognitive practice during the pre-inclusion visit (V0), allowing 
participants to get used to the premises of the investigational center, supervisors and 
conditions of testing. In addition, each test session started with a "Motor screening task" 
("MOT”) included within the task battery (CANTAB). The MOT is a training procedure 
designed to relax the subject and to introduce them to the computer and touch screen. It 
simultaneously screens for difficulties with vision, movement and comprehension and 
ascertains that the subject can follow simple instructions, as well as familiarizing them with 
the touch screen. It is also noteworthy that the CANTAB Battery contains multiple matched 
forms of the tasks which use different stimuli sets in order to minimise carry-over from 
previous assessments. This has to helps to reduce practice effects and increase test–retest 
reliability (44). 
 
Safety assessments included adverse event monitoring, changes in vital signs, and physical 
examinations (heart rate, blood pressure, BMI). Hematology tests were assessed after

overnight fasting: cholesterolemia (total, HDL and LDL), triglyceridemia, insulinemia, 
glycemia, and thyroid status. 
Targeted metabolomic analysis of urinary phenolic metabolites 
Volunteers collected their 24-hour urines the day before each visit (V1 and V2). Urines were 
kept at 4°C until the arrival at the investigation center, then immediately frozen at -80°C. 
Urine samples were centrifuged, mixed with 4% phosphoric acid (v/v) to disrupt 
phenol-protein binding, then extracted using Waters OASIS HLB 96-well plate. Phenolic 
metabolites were characterized by UHPLC-MS/MS as previously described, with slight 
modifications (36). MS analyses were carried out in negative mode with the following 
parameters: capillary voltage, 0.80 kV; source temperature, 140°C; cone gas flow rate, 50 L/h 
and desolvation gas flow rate, 1000 L/h; desolvation temperature, 400°C. Cone voltage and 
collision energy were optimized for each available standard. Data were acquired through the 
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, tracking the transition of a parent/product ion 
specific for each compound. Phenolic metabolites were identified based on retention time and 
molecular ions of individual standards, or fragmentation information described in the 
literature otherwise, and the quantification was conducted using calibration curves of 
available standards. Parent/product ion pairs (MRM) transitions and chemical standards used 
to identify and quantify phenolic metabolites are listed in Table 5.  
Statistical analyses 
The study was designed to detect a difference of 0.35 Standard Deviation in the changes 
(between V1 and V2) of PAL total errors adjusted between placebo and active groups. To 
detect this difference, with an α risk of 5% and 80% power, 102 individuals were required in 
each group. The study was not designed to look at a rate of change in cognition over time.

The change from baseline in PALTEA at 6 months in the placebo and the PEGB groups was 
analyzed using linear regression with adjustment for potential confounding parameters: age, 
investigation center, education level, baseline PALTEA score, baseline urinary polyphenol 
concentration, BMI, systolic blood pressure and heart rate at baseline. The last two variables 
were selected with backward stepwise selection to identify baseline risk factors that impact 
the cognitive performances (45). Linear regression was also carried out for VRM and SSP 
scores, with the same adjustment except the baseline VRM or SSP score respectively. 
Population was then stratified by quartiles according PALTEA score at baseline. Quartiles 
were compared using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests for quantitative data, Khi-2 or Fisher 
tests for qualitative data. Jonckheere-Terpstra test for quantitative data and Cochran Armitage 
test for qualitative data, were used for determining the p for trend. 
The effect of urinary concentrations of phenolic metabolites on the change in PALTEA and 
VRM scores were analyzed using linear regression with adjustment. 
In the Quartile 4 (quartile of decliners, variables for adjustment were also selected with 
backward stepwise selection to identify baseline risk factors that impact the cognitive 
performances. 
Missing values were not imputed. One subject was removed from between visit variation 
analyses due to a missing value for an adjustment parameter (urinary polyphenol 
concentration). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. 
Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of phenolic metabolites detected in 24-hour urines of 
volunteers was carried out using MetaboAnalyst 3.0. Urine concentrations of phenolic 
metabolites were compared using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test based on whether 
data followed a normal distribution or not (GraphPad Prism 7.0).

Two-sided p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. 
Results 
Population description 
215 subjects were enrolled in the study at V0. Nine subjects left the study before the end. The 
intent to treat (ITT) population consisted of 101 subjects in the PEGB group and 105 in the 
placebo group. The per protocol (PP) population (190 subjects, 50/50 investigation center 
repartition) was defined during the blind review in order to avoid major protocol deviations 
and potential bias factors. At the end, the PEGB group was composed of 92 subjects and the 
placebo group of 98 subjects (Supplementary data Figure S1). Baseline characteristics of PP 
population are presented in Table 1. No significant differences were observed between groups 
(data not shown). 
Effect of PEGB on memory performances 
After 6 months of supplementation, participants made fewer PALTEA compared to the 
baseline scores, yet no significant difference was observed between PEGB and placebo 
groups (Table 2; p=0.798). Interestingly, a significant interaction was found between the 
PEGB effect and the baseline PALTEA score (p<0.001). 
Performance at the VRM free recall (VRMFR) was shown to be affected by PEGB 
supplementation. Indeed, the total number of correct words at the immediate recall was 
significantly higher in the PEGB group than in the placebo group after 6 months (p=0.006), 
whereas no between-group difference was observed at baseline. 
No significant effect of PEGB was observed for the VRM Recognition (VRMR) total correct 
in both immediate and delayed recognition (respectively p=0.923 and p=0.528), as well as for

the working memory assessed through the SSP (span length, p=0.509) and the Reverse SSP 
(span length, p=0.312). 
Stratification according to memory performance at baseline  
Owing to a significant interaction between PEGB effect x baseline PALTEA (p<0.001), the 
population was stratified by quartiles according to the baseline PALTEA. The repartition was 
as followed (Table 3): Q1 ≤ 20 errors (n=45); 21 ≤ Q2 ≤ 31 errors (n=49); 32 ≤ Q3 ≤ 56 
errors (n=49); and Q4 ≥ 57 errors (n= 47). 
Interestingly, except for the MMSE, all other cognitive tests displayed a significant difference 
and a global declining trend from Q1 to Q4. Subjects with the lower results for PALTEA at 
baseline were also those obtaining the lowest scores at all the other tests. Thus, the Q4 
subjects presenting a higher cognitive decline manifested by a lower memory performance, 
are referred as ‘decliners’ thereafter. 
Evolution between the four groups also showed that, although they did not significantly differ 
age-wise, the subjects in Q4 tended to be older (p for trend=0.022) and have a significantly 
lower education level (p=0.001; p for trend=0.001). 
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) also showed a significant increase from Q1 to Q4. 
Effect of PEGB consumption on cognitive performances in the decliners (Q4) 
PEGB supplementation was found to significantly improve cognitive performances of 
decliner subjects, in comparison to placebo (Table 4). Indeed, significant effects of the PEGB 
were observed on PALTEA (p=0.037 vs placebo), as well as on the VRMFR (p=0.014 vs 
placebo) and on the delayed version of the VRMR (p=0.005 vs placebo). Of note, the 
improvement on the VRMFR was also observed in subjects of Q3 (data not shown).

Working memory (SSP and Reverse SSP) was not improved in decliners, although their 
baseline performance was lower compared to other quartiles. 
Biomarkers of PEGB consumption 
43 phenolic metabolites were detected in 24-hour urines of volunteers at baseline (V1) and 
after 6 months of supplementation (V2). The heatmap shows the clustering of phenolic 
metabolites according to their concentration level in urine (Figure 1). No difference was 
found between the groups at baseline. While no change was observed in the placebo group, a 
significant increase in urine concentration of 13 metabolites (1.6 to 19.3-fold, p <0.001) was 
observed in the PEGB group after the supplementation (inset graphs in Figure 1, and Table 
5). All these metabolites were detected in significantly higher concentration in the urine of 
PEGB-supplemented subjects, in comparison with the placebo (p <0.01). Among these 
metabolites, 11 compounds were found preferentially clustered according to their 
concentration in urine, and identified as (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, B-type procyanidin 
dimers, conjugated metabolites of (epi)catechins, microbial degradation products of 
(epi)catechins (hydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone and dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone), and 
gallic acid. These metabolites are referred thereafter as “biomarkers of PEGB consumption”. 
Dietary intake and urinary excretion of polyphenols 
Some differences were found in baseline urinary concentrations of phenolic metabolites 
between the quartiles, which, interestingly, do not appear to be related to differences in 
dietary polyphenol consumption (Table 6). A downward trend in baseline dietary polyphenol 
intake was observed between the subjects of the four quartiles (Q1 to Q4, p for trend=0.008), 
the decliners being the lowest consumers. However, all quartiles displayed a similar flavonoid 
intake (i.e. flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins (DP<10), anthocyanins, flavonols and

flavanones) (p=0.586), especially flavan-3-ols (data not shown), as estimated by food surveys. 
Yet, urinary concentrations of conjugated (epi)catechins and biomarkers of PEGB 
consumption (but not (epi)catechins) were significantly different between quartiles at baseline 
(respectively: p=0.048; p=0.023) with a significant increase from Q1 to Q4 (conjugated 
(epi)catechins: p for trend=0.006; biomarkers of PEGB consumption: p for trend=0.006). 
Note that this difference in the concentration of excreted conjugated (epi)catechins was also 
observed between the four quartiles after 6 months of PEGB supplementation, still with a 
significant increase from Q1 to Q4 (p for trend=0.025, data not shown).  
Relation between changes in urinary polyphenol concentrations and cognitive tests 
The investigation was restricted to metabolites for which the concentration was significantly 
increased between V1 and V2 in the PEGB group (Figure 1). 
In the whole population, the association between changes (V2-V1) in urinary concentration of 
biomarkers of PEGB consumption and changes in the performances at the VRMFR test 
during the study almost reached a significant level (p=0.058). Interestingly, in the whole 
population, a strong association was found between the variation (V2-V1) of urinary 
concentration of native and conjugated derivatives of (epi)catechins (p=0.016 and p=0.010 
respectively), and the increase in the VRMFR correct responses (Table 7). Similar 
associations were observed in decliners. In particular, variation of (epi)catechins and their 
conjugates were associated with the VRMFR improvement (p=0.036 and p=0.053 
respectively). Moreover, change in urinary concentration of PEGB biomarkers, (epi)catechins, 
and their conjugated metabolites were also associated with the increase in total correct 
responses in VRMR delayed (p=0.032, p=0.055 and p=0.032 respectively).

However, no phenolic metabolite was found to be significantly associated with improvement 
in the PALTEA in decliners. Overall, we could not identify significant association between 
the microbial metabolites of (epi)catechins, the valerolactones, -type procyanidins dimers, or 
phenolic compounds present in PEGB and memory improvement. 
Discussion 
Blueberry and grape have both been reported to improve memory performances in humans 
(21-23). In the present study, we investigated the beneficial effects on memory of a 
polyphenol-rich combination of blueberry and grape extracts (PEGB),  which provides high 
amounts of monomeric flavanols, known to reduce cognitive decline in mice (37). This 
combination offers a synergistic action between the two extracts (36). Indeed, we previously 
demonstrated a potentiation of the absorption of blueberry polyphenols by grape polyphenols 
in mice, therefore indicating positive interactions occurring between phytochemicals in this 
specific formulation, resulting in their improved bioavailability (36). While not showing 
significant improvement in episodic memory in the whole population after a 6-month 
supplementation with PEGB, the present study, clearly demonstrates a positive effect on 
episodic memory of a subset of this population, healthy elderly subjects presenting the highest 
memory decline.  
 Effect of PEGB on episodic memory 
Supplementing the participants for 6 months with PEGB did not result in a significant 
decrease in the primary outcome of this study, the PALTEA in the whole study population. 
We observed a high variability in baseline PAL score, which may be explained by inter-center 
differences including educational level that was lower in French volunteers. Indeed, the 
incidence of cognitive decline has been found to be lower in more educated populations (46).

Moreover, we noticed that subjects in the placebo group had a lower PALTEA at the second 
visit than at baseline. This observation may rely on a test-retest effect.  
Indeed, although, the protocol included a cognitive practice and a MOT, improvements in 
cognitive scores measured in the placebo group reveal that a test-retest effect subsisted in this 
study. This has been previously described (43). This practice effect reduced the chances to 
show a significant between-group difference thus the significant PEGB effects showed in the 
present study were probably underestimated. Importantly, this practice effect probably 
accounts for the failure of showing a significant effect on the primary outcome in the whole 
study population. Indeed, it was more difficult to demonstrate a significant effect of PEGB in 
participants whose results were already quite good at baseline (since margin of improvement 
was small). 
Interestingly, we showed that the 6-month PEGB supplementation significantly protected 
verbal episodic memory, a secondary criteria of the trial, as measured by VRMFR. However, 
this was not the case for working memory evaluated by SSP, although baseline span lengths 
were consistent with results previously published for subjects of the same age (60-70-year-
old) (47).  
The effect of PEGB depends on the level of memory performance at baseline 
Our analysis revealed a significant interaction between the PEGB effect and baseline 
PALTEA. In order to determine which subjects were responsive to the supplementation, we 
stratified the population into quartiles according to the baseline PALTEA, the main criteria of 
the study. This stratification clearly separated a sub-group (Q4 or decliners) committing more 
errors (> 57). Such a high number of errors was also reported by Junkilla et al.(48) and was 
used to distinguish ‘normal’ subjects (< 60 errors) from MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) or

AD (Alzheimer’s disease) subjects (> 60 errors) (48). However, Q4 subjects did not display 
low MMSE score, as reported by Junkilla et al. (48), thus we cannot recognize them as 
subjects affected by MCI or AD. 
The decliners presented lower memory performances than people of the same age group. 
They exhibited global cognitive impairment, with lower results in various tests compared to 
subjects of other quartiles. It is noteworthy that these subjects also had a lower level of 
education. However, consistently with the inclusion criteria, they were generally healthy as 
confirmed by blood tests (data not shown). 
Interestingly, our results showed a beneficial effect of PEGB supplementation on episodic and 
recognition memory in decliners. This effect was significant despite the low number of 
subjects. Using the normative data of the CANTAB battery (www.camcog.com), the baseline 
cognitive age of the decliners was estimated at 83.25 for the PEGB group and 82.11 for the 
placebo group. After 6 months, the cognitive age of the supplemented subjects was estimated 
at 69.60 years, therefore corresponding to a 13.65-year improvement (in comparison with a 
5.48-year improvement for the placebo group). The nutritional intervention thus ‘rejuvenated’ 
the decliners’ memory to their normal cognitive age for their group (60 – 70 years). 
To our knowledge, the effect of polyphenols on episodic memory evaluated by PAL has never 
been shown to date. Previous interventional studies with grape or blueberry juice, performed 
on MCI subjects, revealed no effect on PAL performance compared to placebo (22, 23). By 
contrast, a beneficial effect of the consumption of flavan-3-ols on verbal recognition memory 
has been highlighted by a longitudinal approach during aging (13). Moreover, a small-sized 
effect of grape juice on verbal episodic memory was previously observed using Californian 
Verbal Learning Test (22). More recently, tow randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled

trials, highlighted the effectiveness of blueberry consumption on verbal recognition memory 
and working memory in healthy elderly subjects  (25, 26). 
The daily dose of PEGB is equivalent to a consumption of less than 200 g of fresh fruits. Our 
study therefore demonstrates that a nutritional amount of berry polyphenols improves the 
memory of healthy elderly people exhibiting an age-related cognitive decline, and restores the 
performances expected for their age. 
Association between polyphenol metabolites and cognitive performances 
Urinary concentration of polyphenols is generally considered as a reliable marker of their 
consumption (49). A recent epidemiological study showed that urinary polyphenol 
measurement was more suitable than dietary survey to associate polyphenol consumption with 
biological effects, and demonstrated an association between excreted concentrations of 
phenolic metabolites and the risk of cognitive decline measured by the MMSE (14, 50). In the 
present work, we found that changes in flavan-3-ols were strongly associated with memory 
improvement. Indeed, increases in urine levels of (epi)catechins and especially their 
conjugated metabolites were positively and significantly correlated with memory performance 
at the VRMFR and the VRMR delayed. This was not the case for PALTEA where no 
correlation was observed. We assumed that the lack of association between these factors and 
PALTEA in decliners might be attributed to the low number of subjects in this group. 
Moreover, in contrast to what was observed in animals (36), no significant correlation 
between urinary concentration of microbial metabolites of flavan-3-ols and memory 
performance was noted. 
Direct effects of polyphenols on the brain, such as on cerebral plasticity, on brain blood flow 
or on hippocampal neurogenesis, have already been reported in preclinical studies (35, 36, 51-

53). The investigations carried out in the present study did not enable us to associate the 
observed memory improvements with a direct effect on brain and/or an indirect systemic 
effect. 
Variation in polyphenol consumption and excretion between the quartiles 
As estimated by the 3-day food diaries filled at V1 and V2, the average amount of 
polyphenols consumed by the population under study (around 1.5 g/day) was comparable to 
that previously reported for occidental population (54). However, we observed a significant 
downward trend in total dietary polyphenol intake between the subjects once stratified in 
quartiles, with the decliners (Q4) being the lowest consumers (around 300 mg/day less than 
subjects of Q1). Focusing on flavonoids, the mean dietary intake of volunteers was estimated 
around 150 mg/day, PEGB supplementation raising this amount to 410 mg/day, a normal 
daily consumption expected for occidental people (400-500 mg/day;(38)). No difference in 
flavonoid (and especially flavan-3-ols) intake was found among the quartiles. It is noteworthy 
that, based on dietary surveys, the volunteers did not significantly change their polyphenol 
dietary intake during the study.  
Interestingly, in addition to a lower polyphenol consumption in decliners, the metabolomic 
profiling of their urine revealed a significantly higher concentration of (epi)catechins 
conjugated metabolites and biomarkers of PEGB consumption at baseline; this observation 
correlated with their lower memory performances. This higher excretion of phenolic 
metabolites suggests a greater xenobiotic detoxification system (phase 2 metabolism, 
transport or excretion processes) in decliners, which therefore would not fully benefit from a 
regular consumption of polyphenol. Such inter-individual differences in absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion of bioactive compounds are known to be responsible 
for the heterogeneity in biological responses observed between individuals (55). Our study

therefore indicates that an excessive elimination of bioactive polyphenols may contribute to 
increase age-related cognitive impairments. Unfortunately, in absence of plasma conjugate 
levels measurements, we can only speculate on the mechanisms explaining this higher 
excretion in the decliners subpopulation. The improvement of memory performances 
observed in the present study demonstrates that the supplementation of decliners with PEGB 
partially compensated for their lower polyphenols consumption and higher urinary polyphenol 
excretion, providing a sufficient bioavailable amount of bioactive polyphenols to improve 
their memory.  
Conclusion 
While not showing significant improvement of the primary outcome in the whole population 
after a 6-month supplementation with PEGB, the present study demonstrated a positive effect 
on verbal episodic memory, on a subset of this population, healthy elderly with a lower level 
of memory performance. Our results also suggest that monomers of flavan-3-ols 
((epi)catechins), and their conjugated metabolites are important to maintain the integrity of 
episodic memory systems and that it may be necessary to consume a minimum level to reach 
this effect. 
Taking into account their beneficial effect on health, our study confirms the need to define a 
recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for flavonoids and revise recommendations for foods 
rich in these bioactives. We also highlighted the importance of considering inter-individual 
variations in metabolism, clearance and therefore efficacy of these polyphenols in order to 
move toward a personalized nutrition.

Figure 1 | Hierarchical clustering analysis heatmap of phenolic metabolites identified in 
24-hour urine of volunteers following the 6-month supplementation study 
Each row represents a metabolite detected in urine and each column a volunteer of the study 
(PP population). Blue and red tiles respectively indicate a lower or higher intensity of 
concentration in urine for each metabolite. * Phenolic metabolites whose concentration in 
urine was significantly increased following PEGB supplementation (see Table 5 for 
concentrations).
