Other Cardiovascular Health Metrics in Young Adults: National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011-2014

Background-—Binge drinking prevalence rates are highest in young adults; however, little is known about the effects of binge
drinking on blood pressure (BP) and other cardiovascular health metrics in individuals between 18 and 45 years of age. The aim of
this study was to determine the effects of regular binge drinking on BP, lipid and glucose levels and to determine if there were
differences in these associations between men and women.
Methods and Results-—We analyzed data from NHANES (the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) for men and
women 18 to 45 years old who were non–binge drinkers, binge drank 1 to 12 times, or binge drank >12 times in the past year.
After controlling for diet and physical activity, both categories of men binge drinkers compared with non–binge drinkers had higher
systolic BP (121.8 and 119.0 mm Hg versus 117.5 mm Hg) and total cholesterol (215.5 and 217.9 mg/dL versus 207.8 mg/dL)
values. There were no effects of binge drinking on systolic BP or total cholesterol in women. Binge drinking in men and women was
associated with higher high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol values. The effects of binge drinking on glucose parameters in men and
women were variable.
Conclusions-—Compared with young adult women, repeated binge drinking in men was associated with an elevated systolic BP,
and greater frequency of binge drinking in men was associated with a more unfavorable lipid profile. In young adults with elevated
systolic BP, practitioners should consider the possible role of binge drinking and address the importance of reducing alcohol intake
as an important cardiovascular risk reduction strategy. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008733. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.

n middle-aged and older adults, binge drinking is associ-
ated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction,
stroke, and hypertension.1-5 Binge drinking is also associated
with an increased likelihood of developing prehypertension,
previously defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) between
120 and 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
between 70 and 90 mm Hg.6 In nearly all population-based
studies examining the effects of alcohol on blood pressure
(BP)
and
other
cardiovascular
metrics,
young
adults
(18-30 years) and those in middle adulthood (31-45 years)
are underrepresented.1,7 In the United States high rates of
binge drinking are prevalent in both of these age cohorts.8
Binge drinking is often defined as consuming 5 drinks or more
in a row for men (≥4 drinks for women) per occasion within
the past 30 days.7
Present-day young adults consume 6 to 7 drinks per binge-
drinking episode (exceeding the current binge threshold of
4+/5+ drinks per episode) and binge drink several times a
week.9-12 Compared with previous generations, the intensity
(ie, 6-7 drinks) and regularity (several times per week) of binge
drinking may place today’s young adults at greater risk for
more profound rates of alcohol-related harm, such as elevated
BP and increased prevalence of other cardiovascular risk
factors. In particular, elevated BP is one of the strongest,
most modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease.13
Even among normotensive individuals, small reductions in
average BP may have a marked impact on the future
development of cardiovascular disease.14 The new High Blood
Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline defines “elevated BP” as a

 systolic BP between 120 and 129 mm Hg and diastolic >80
mm Hg.15 In the United States it is estimated that alcohol
consumption may account for close to 10% of the population
burden of hypertension.15
The aim of this study was to investigate the association
between repeated binge drinking and BP as well as lipid and
fasting glucose levels in adults between 18 and 45 years of
age. We also sought to determine if there were differences in
these associations between men and women. We analyzed
data from NHANES (the US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey) for male and female 18- to 45-year-olds
who were non–binge drinkers, binge drank 1 to 12 times, or
binge drank >12 times in the past year.16
Methods
Study Population
NHANES uses a multistage stratified probability sampling
approach to identify participants and allows for the generation
of nationally representative estimates. NHANES is conducted
in 2-year cycles, and we used data from the 2 most recent
NHANES cycles (2011-2012 and 2013-2014).17,18 Survey
data include interview, physical examination, and laboratory
measurement of serum lipids and glucose levels.19 NHANES is
publicly available, and our study/analysis was determined to
be exempt by the University of Illinois Institutional Review
Board.
We restricted our analysis to include young adult and mid-
adulthood examinees (18-45 years old). Exclusion criteria
included those with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (ie,
coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction, heart failure,
stroke) or who were pregnant. Because we were interested in
the effects of binge drinking on BP, those with hypertension
or
actual
BP
values
exceeding
140/90 mm Hg
were
included, along with those reporting use of antihypertensive
medications.
Definition of Binge Drinking
We categorized responses into those who reported binge
drinking 1 to 12 times or ≥12 times in the past year through
the question: “In the past 12 months, how many days did you
have 4/5 or more drinks of any alcoholic beverage?” The
answer could be given in days per week, month, or year.
Measurement of Blood Pressure and Other
Variables
Per the NHANES analytic protocol, SBP and DBP were measured
using a sphygmomanometer after participants had rested in a
seated position for 5 minutes. Once the participant’s maximum
inflation level had been determined, 3 consecutive BP readings
were obtained.20 The mean of the 3 readingswascalculatedand
used for the BP outcomes. Enzymatic analytic techniques are
usedforthemeasurementoftotalcholesterol,triglycerides(TG),
high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) and apolipoprotein
B.20 Fasting lipid samples were measured in the morning in
examinees who had fasted for at least 8.5 hours but less than
24 hours. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) was
calculated using total cholesterol, TG, and HDL-c values,
according to the Friedewald calculation. Methods for the
measurement of fasting glucose were unchanged between the
above NHANES cycles.20 Detailed specimen collection and
processinginstructionsaredescribedintheNHANESLaboratory
Procedure Manual.20
Ideal Cardiovascular Metrics
As recommended by the American Heart Association, ideal
cardiovascular metrics include untreated SBP/DBP <120/
<80 mm Hg and fasting blood glucose <100 mg/dL.21 For
blood lipids, ideal status includes total cholesterol ≤200 mg/
dL, LDL-c ≤100 mg/dL, HDL-c ≥50 mg/dL, TG ≤200 mg/dL,
and apolipoprotein B ≤130 mg/dL.21
Statistical Analysis
The analysis was performed using STATA 14.2 (StataCorp
LLC, College Station, TX). Pooling of 2011-2012 and 2013-
2014 data was performed to provide stable estimates of all
cardiovascular outcomes. Following NHANES analytic and
reporting guidelines, all statistical tests were conducted using
STATA survey analysis statistics and weights to account for the
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Young adult men (18-45 years) with a repeated history of
binge drinking have higher systolic blood pressure and total
cholesterol levels compared with non–binge
drinkers,
whereas in women no effect of binge drinking was found
on these parameters.
• In men and women, binge drinking was associated with
higher high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and glu-
cose levels were higher in binge-drinking women but lower
in binge-drinking men.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• In young adulthood, binge drinking may be associated with
an elevated blood pressure; therefore, young adults need to
be screened and counseled about alcohol misuse, including
binge drinking, and advised on how binge drinking may
affect their cardiovascular health.

 complex survey design (including oversampling), survey nonre-
sponse, and poststratification. When a sample is weighted in
NHANES, it is representative of the US Census civilian
noninstitutionalized population. Dietary interview subsample
weights were used, excepting measures of LDL-c, TG, and
fasting glucose, which used fasting subsample weights. The
sample sizes for the measures that required fasting are smaller
because fewer participants had fasted at the time of examina-
tion. A subsample of all participants meeting the inclusion
criteria was designated with the STATA software for all analyses
to ensure correct study-design weighting. Dietary covariates for
each participant were drawn from 2 days of NHANES dietary
interview data. “Estimates of total intake of energy, nutrients,
and nonnutrient food components from foods and beverages
that were consumed during the 24-hour period before the
interview
(midnight
to
midnight)”
were
collected
from
participants.16 Dietary covariates were calculated using an
averageoftotalvaluesforthe2 daysofdietaryinterviewdata.In
addition, as a further measure of dietary intake/practices, we
calculatedtheDASH(DietaryApproachestoStopHypertension)
adherence score using nutrient targets reported by Kim and
Andrade,22 which resulted in a DASH adherence score ranging
from 0 to 9. A greater DASH adherence score indicates greater
DASH diet compliance. Binge drinking was analyzed as a
categorical exposure because of its nonnormal distribution and
the nonlinear relationship between binge drinking and cardio-
vascular
outcomes.

regression models were used to assess differences in demo-
graphic characteristics by frequencyof binge drinking (Table 1).

survey year, moderate or vigorous recreational exercise per
week (yes or no), hours of sedentary activity per day, number of
hours watching TV or videos per day, number of meals not home
prepared in the past week, sodium intake, and DASH adherence

for the presence of hypertension. Hypertension was defined as
an average SBP ≥140 mm Hg, an average DBP ≥90 mm Hg, a
diagnosis of hypertension, or a current prescription of hyper-
tension medication.
Results
Combining data from the NHANES 2011-2012 and 2013-
2014 surveys gave us an unweighted sample size of 5554
individuals aged 18 to 45 years with medical examination
data. After application of the exclusion criteria, the sample
size was reduced to 5329 (4% decrease). The final sample size
of 4710 resulted from those who met the inclusion criteria
and had alcohol use data. Participants with dietary interview
data totaled 3964 (16% decrease), and participants with
dietary and fasting medical examination data totaled 1990
(50% decrease). Weighting was applied matching the applica-
ble subsample of each analysis.
Table 1 displays the demographic characteristics of the
sample. High-frequency binge drinking (>12 times a year) was
reported by 25.1% of men and 11.8% of women. Binge
drinking 12 times a year or less was reported by 29.0% of men
and 25.1% of women. Older women had lower rates of binge
drinking. Black men and women participants and Hispanic
women had lower rates of binge drinking than their white
counterparts. Men with lower family income had higher rates
of binge drinking, as did women with higher education levels.
Underweight men had a lower rate of midfrequency binge
drinking (12 times per year or less), and obese men had lower
rates of high-frequency binge drinking. Men and women binge
drinkers were more likely to be current or past smokers than
non–binge drinkers (Table 1).
Women who binge drank 1 to 12 times in the past year
reported higher rates of moderate or vigorous recreational
activity. Women who binge drank 12+ times in the past year
reported more hours sedentary than non–binge-drinking
women and more hours watching TV or videos per day
compared with women who binge drank less or not at all
(Table 2). Men who binge drank 1 to 12 times in the past year
reported less time watching TV or videos. Men and women
binge drinkers ate fewer meals prepared at home compared
with non–binge drinkers. Overall, participants far exceeded
the recommended daily values for sodium intake (2300 mg).
Men who binge drank 12+ times per year consumed more
sodium than non–binge-drinking men and more calories than
men who binge drank less or not at all.
For men, compared with non–binge drinkers, binge drink-
ing was associated with a higher SBP, whereas binge drinking
had no effects on DBP (Table 3). SBP for men was also higher
in higher-frequency binge drinkers compared with lower-
frequency binge drinkers (P=0.04; Table 3). The relationship
of binge drinking with SBP was significantly different for men
compared with women as represented by the significant
interaction effects in these models. No effects of binge
drinking on SBP were found in women; however, women who
binge drank ≤12 times per year had lower DBP compared with
higher-frequency binge drinkers and non–binge drinkers
(Table 3). For men, compared with non–binge drinkers, binge
drinking was associated with a higher total cholesterol (TC)
levels. TC levels were significantly different for men compared
with women as represented by the significant interaction
effects in these models (Table 3). Men who binge drank ≥12
times in the past year had higher LDL-c and apolipoprotein B
levels, whereas no effects of drinking status were found on
these lipid parameters for women. In men and women, there

 were no differences in TG levels among the 3 groups. HDL-c
was higher for men and women binge drinkers compared with
non–binge drinkers. Men who binge drank >12 times per year
had lower glucose levels than non–binge-drinking men.
Women who binge drank 1 to 12 times per year had higher
glucose levels than non–binge-drinking women.
Discussion
The major findings of this study are as follows: (1) Men (18-
45 years) with a repeated history of binge drinking have
higher SBP and TC levels compared with non–binge drinkers,
even after higher levels of sodium intake and lower physical
activity profiles have been taken into account. (2) Higher HDL-

 c levels were associated with binge drinking for both men and
women. Finally, (3) glucose levels were higher in binge-
drinking women but lower in binge-drinking men.
In young and mid-adulthood individuals, few studies have
examined the effects of repeated binge drinking on BP levels
and other cardiovascular parameters. In a combined sample
of men and women (mean age 43 years), Abramson and
colleagues found binge drinking (5 or more drinks on at least
1 occasion per month) was associated with 24-hour ambu-
latory SBP and daytime SBP values that were 5 and 6 mm Hg
greater than those of non–binge drinkers.23 The “acute” (or
“1-time” effect) of binge drinking on BP has been examined in
healthy men aged 22-33 years.24-26 In these studies, subjects
consumed >4 to 5 standard drinks over a short period of time
(ie, 2- to 5-hour period). Data from these studies indicated
that a “1-time” binge episode was associated with increases
in BP that ranged 4 to 7 mm Hg for SBP and 4 to 6 mm Hg
for DBP.24-26 Data also support that a history of binge drinking
in young adulthood is associated with higher BP values.
Wellman and colleagues examined the relationship between
BP and current and past binge drinking among young adults
(men and women, mean age 24 years).27 Binge drinking was
defined as consuming 5 or more drinks on 1 occasion.
Subjects were recruited in 1999 (mean age 12 years), and
follow-up was 2007-2008 (mean age 20 years) and 2011-
2014 (mean age 24 years). Among 24-year-old subjects, both
monthly and weekly binge drinkers had SBP values 2.61 and
4.03 mm Hg greater, respectively, than non–binge drinkers
(similar BP increase findings were found in the 20-year-old
subjects).27
Among men in our cohort, frequency of binge drinking (more
than 12 times in the past year) was associated with higher
increases in SBP compared with less frequent binge drinking (1-
12 times in the past year). In our study, men who binge drank
(binge drank >12 times in past year) had elevated BP
(121.8�0.8 mm Hg) as defined by the new High Blood
Pressure Clinical Practice Guidelines.15 Using data from the
1999-2004 NHANES, Fan et al found that in men (not women;
mean age 38 years), binge drinking was associated with a
greater prevalence of prehypertension (defined as SBP between
120 and 140 mm Hg and DBP between 70 and 90 mm Hg).6 In
addition, SBP values were greater in men who reported binge
drinking more than once a week (123.1�0.8 mm Hg) com-
pared with SBP values (120.4�1.0 mm Hg) in those who
reported binge drinking less than once a week.6 In women, SBP
values were nearly identical across groups,6 which is similar to
our current findings.
Few studies have specifically examined the effects of binge
drinking on lipid parameters. We found that binge drinking
affected plasma lipids and that the effects were different in
men and women. For men, compared with non–binge
drinkers, binge drinking was associated with higher TC and

 LDL-c levels, whereas no effects of binge drinking were found
in young adult women. Galan and colleagues examined
different drinking patterns and lipid profiles among Spanish
participants (age range 45-51 years) in the ENRICA study
(N=10 356).28 Binge drinking was defined as ≥80 g of alcohol
for men and ≥60 g for women in any given drinking session
during the preceding 30 days. Drinking patterns were also
qualified as “regular moderate” (≤40 g/day for men and
≤24 g/day for women) and “regular heavy” (≥40 g/day for
men and ≥24 g/day for women). These investigators found
that, compared with nondrinkers, all levels of drinkers
(including binge) had lower TC and LDL-c levels.28 These
findings differ from our findings, and although they are not
completely understood, they may be related to age and to the
different ethnicities of our populations.
We found no significant effect of binge drinking status on
TG levels in men or women. Similarly, Galan and colleagues
found that TG levels were not different among drinking
groups, although levels tended to be higher in both heavy
drinkers
and
heavy
binge
drinkers.28
Among
Japanese
subjects (N=31 295), Wakabayashi found that “regular (every
day)” and “occasional (sometimes)” heavy drinkers (defined
as >66 g ethanol/day) had significantly greater TG levels
compared with nondrinkers. As noted above, differences
among studies may be related to age and to the different
ethnicities of our populations.
It is important to note that in our study LDL-c values in
both young adult binge drinkers and non–binge drinkers were
above the AHA recommended target of 100 mg/dL. Pletcher
and colleagues found that young people (18-30 years) with
even modestly elevated TC levels are more likely to develop
coronary artery calcium and atherosclerosis later in life.29 In
men, binge drinking may contribute to higher TC and LDL-c
levels. Although TG levels were within normal range, TG levels
tended to be higher in frequent male binge drinkers. Others
have also shown that young adults with higher TG levels (but
within the normal TG range) may still be at risk for premature
cardiovascular disease. For example, in a young adult cohort
(mean age 28 years), Grebe and colleagues found that TG
levels were positively correlated with carotid intima-media
thickness (a surrogate marker of early atherosclerosis).30
Urbina et al also reported that among young adults (mean
age 19 years), arterial stiffness, a measure of increased
cardiovascular risk propensity (measured as higher brachial
artery dispensability and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity),
increased with TG/HDL-c ratios among low-, mid-, and high-
TG/HDL-c ratio groups (0.8, 1.3, and 2.7 ratios, respec-
tively).31 Although the reason for higher lipid levels may be
multifactorial, all young adults need to be counseled about
the importance of diet and exercise and how adverse lipid
profile levels can increase the risk of future cardiovascular
events.
Increased levels of HDL-c in young adults have been
associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk later in life.29
The role of HDL-c, however, has been brought into question by
negative findings from clinical drug trials and negative
Mendelian randomization studies.32 In our study binge
drinking was associated with higher HDL-c levels, and in all
groups HDL-c levels were greater than 50 mg/dL.
Few studies have examined the effect of binge drinking on
metabolic parameters, such as fasting glucose. In our study
fasting glucose was decreased for binge-drinking men com-
pared with non–binge drinkers but higher in binge-drinking
women compared with non–binge-drinking women. Impor-
tantly, in our analysis we included potential confounders
related to diet and physical activity, parameters that can
affect glucose levels. Increased fasting glucose is a feature of
metabolic syndrome.33 Using NHANES data, others have
reported that frequent binge drinking (once or more per week)
(mean age 42 years) was associated with an increased
adjusted odds ratio for developing metabolic syndrome.34
However, impaired (or increased) fasting glucose was not one
of the metabolic abnormalities associated with the increased
odds for metabolic syndrome.34 Similar to our findings and
after controlling for body mass index and smoking, Nygren
and colleagues found that higher alcohol consumption
together with binge drinking was associated with the highest
fasting plasma glucose levels in women but not in men.35
These data are from the Northern Swedish prospective
longitudnial (27 years) cohort study, which enrolled subjects
at 16 years of age and included follow-up to 43 years of
age.35
In the present study we also examined male-female
differences in the association of binge drinking and BP, lipids,
and glucose levels. Over the past decade, long-standing
differences in drinking patterns between men and women
have been converging, such that prevalence rates of binge
drinking are rising in women while they remain unchanged in
men.36 Studies that have examined the effects of binge
drinking on cardiovascular parameters, such as BP have
included men and women, but not all of these have
determined the potential interaction effect of sex.2,27 More
research is needed to ascertain sex differences in the effects
of binge drinking on the cardiovascular system and metabolic
parameters in young adult men and women.
Our results should be viewed in the context of the study
design, which, because of the cross-sectional nature of the
NHANES, disallows conclusions about causal relationships.
Even though the NHANES cohort allowed for the inclusion of a
large sample size and is representative of young adults in the
United States, the findings of this study may not be
generalizable to other geographic areas outside the United
States. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine
the adverse effects of binge drinking on cardiovascular

 metrics in young adults and with adjustment for dietary and
physical activity profiles that could confound results between
nondrinkers and binge drinkers. Future research should
include prospective and longitudinal analysis of cardiovascu-
lar metrics as well as the measurement of parameters, such
as carotid intima-media thickness and brachial-ankle pulse
wave velocity that reflect early subclinical cardiovascular
changes.
We found that binge drinking was associated with higher
SBP levels in binge drinkers compared with non–binge
drinkers, and frequent binge drinking had additional unfavor-
able effects on lipid values. Our findings have important public
health relevance for young adults because recent evidence
suggests that development of elevated BP before the age of
45 years is associated with significantly higher risks of
cardiovascular death later in life compared with those who
develop hypertension later in life.37 Rates of hypertension in
young adults are increasing, and rates of hypertension
awareness and control are lowest in this group.38 As
highlighted in several other recent publications, targeting
elevated BP and implementing lifestyle interventions to
reduce BP in early adulthood may be an important strategy
to prevent cardiovascular disease later in life.13,39 Young
adults need to be screened and counseled about alcohol
misuse, including binge drinking, and advised on how binge
drinking may affect their cardiovascular health.
