Abstract
Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex neurobiological disorders that impair social interactions and
communication and lead to restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. The causes
of these disorders remain poorly understood, but gut microbiota, the 1013 bacteria in the human intestines, have been
implicated because children with ASD often suffer gastrointestinal (GI) problems that correlate with ASD severity. Several
previous studies have reported abnormal gut bacteria in children with ASD. The gut microbiome-ASD connection has
been tested in a mouse model of ASD, where the microbiome was mechanistically linked to abnormal metabolites and
behavior. Similarly, a study of children with ASD found that oral non-absorbable antibiotic treatment improved GI and
ASD symptoms, albeit temporarily. Here, a small open-label clinical trial evaluated the impact of Microbiota Transfer
Therapy (MTT) on gut microbiota composition and GI and ASD symptoms of 18 ASD-diagnosed children.
Results: MTT involved a 2-week antibiotic treatment, a bowel cleanse, and then an extended fecal microbiota transplant
(FMT) using a high initial dose followed by daily and lower maintenance doses for 7–8 weeks. The Gastrointestinal
Symptom Rating Scale revealed an approximately 80% reduction of GI symptoms at the end of treatment, including
significant improvements in symptoms of constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, and abdominal pain. Improvements
persisted 8 weeks after treatment. Similarly, clinical assessments showed that behavioral ASD symptoms improved
significantly and remained improved 8 weeks after treatment ended. Bacterial and phagedeep sequencing analyses
revealed successful partial engraftment of donor microbiota and beneficial changes in the gut environment. Specifically,
overall bacterial diversity and the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Desulfovibrio among other taxa increased
following MTT, and these changes persisted after treatment stopped (followed for 8 weeks).
Conclusions: This exploratory, extended-duration treatment protocol thus appears to be a promising approach to alter
the gut microbiome and virome and improve GI and behavioral symptoms of ASD. Improvements in GI symptoms, ASD
symptoms, and the microbiome all persisted for at least 8 weeks after treatment ended, suggesting a long-term impact.

Background
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are complex neuro-
biological disorders that impair social interactions and
communication and lead to restricted, repetitive, and
stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities
[1]. While ASD diagnoses are increasing, with ~1–2% of
children currently diagnosed worldwide [2], the causes
of this disorder remain poorly understood and appear to
involve a complex interplay of genetic and environmental
factors, of which the microbiome is an environmental fac-
tor that is partially inherited from the mother [3]. Despite
increased ASD diagnoses, there remains no US Food and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)-approved
pharmaceutical
treatment to alleviate core ASD symptoms [4]. Coincident
with ASD, many children and adults also experience sig-
nificant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as constipa-
tion, diarrhea, and alternating constipation/diarrhea [5],
which correlate with ASD severity [6, 7]. Such GI symp-
toms appear to be due, in part, to dysbiotic gut microbiota
[8] and perhaps their missing roles on modulating metab-
olites (e.g., 4-ethylphenylsulfate, indolepyruvate, and cor-
ticosterone) that affect GI function and neurobiological
conditions, such as ASD and anxiety [9, 10]. Many chil-
dren with ASD often undergo increased oral antibiotic
treatment during the first 3 years of life [11], which is
thought to destabilize their gut microbiota [12] and open
opportunities for competitive potential pathogens to con-
tribute to ASD severity [13, 14]. A number of studies re-
ported that children with ASD have altered gut bacteria
profiles compared with neurotypcial children [13–18], al-
though in certain cohorts, no significant difference has
been reported [19, 20]. Because children with ASD have
lower abundances of fermentative bacteria (e.g., Prevotella
copri), and lower overall bacterial diversity, it has also
been hypothesized that lack of beneficial gut microbiota
impairs neurological health [21]. Consistent with this, ex-
periments done in an ASD mouse model demonstrated
that augmentation with Bacteroides fragilis alone could
alter gut microbiota and blood metabolite profiles, correct
increased gut permeability (gaps in cell-to-cell junctions),
and improve ASD-associated behaviors [9]. In children
with ASD, a small open-label study found that 8 weeks of
treatment with oral vancomycin (a non-absorbable anti-
biotic which acts only in the gut) led to major improve-
ments in both GI symptoms and ASD symptoms,
although the benefits were lost within a few weeks after
treatment was stopped [22]. Thus, gut microbiota appears
strongly associated with ASD. Viruses are also abundant
in the gut [23] and may also impact ASD symptoms by
modulating the abundance, evolutionary trajectories, and
metabolic outputs of gut microbiota like they do in other
environments [24].
Interest in rebalancing human gut microbiota to treat
disease is growing [25]. Diet, antibiotics, probiotics, pre-
biotics, and fecal microbiota transplants are treatments
with reported potential [26–30]. For ASD, however, only
temporary symptom improvements have been reported
from vancomycin treatment [22], and probiotics have
had mixed clinical results with minimal microbiota ana-
lysis or long-term follow-up [31]. Contrasting to probio-
tics which contain a few bacterial species from milk
cultures, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) contains ap-
proximately a thousand bacterial species native to the
gut and has helped treat recurrent Clostridium difficile
infection [32] and is promising for the treatment of
chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory
bowel disease [33] and insulin sensitivity [34]. Therefore,
ASD’s GI and behavioral symptoms may derive, at least
in part, from gut microbiota dysbiosis and FMT may ef-
fectively rebalance the gut microbiota and alleviate some
GI and ASD symptoms.
FMT therapy usually involves only a single dose for re-
current C. difficile infection [32] and other GI conditions,
although there is a growing interest in the use of several
doses [35]. For this study, a prolonged, daily treatment
regimen was implemented based on the clinical experi-
ences of team member Thomas Borody who found that
only C. difficile infection is responsive to one or two FMT
infusions. All other GI problems—originally described in
ulcerative colitis [36]—require multiple infusions of donor
microbiota to achieve measurable and long-lasting bene-
fits, including those associated with ASD. An open-label
trial was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and
efficacy of FMT for GI and behavior symptoms in children
with ASD. Long-term FMT treatment was administered
to 18 children with GI problems and ASD. Clinical re-
sponses, gut bacteria, and phage double-stranded DNA
profiles were monitored for 18 weeks. Briefly, a modified
FMT
protocol,
termed
Microbiota Transfer
Therapy
(MTT), involved 14 days of oral vancomycin treatment
followed by 12–24 h fasting with bowel cleansing, then re-
populating gut microbiota by administering a high initial
dose of Standardized Human Gut Microbiota (SHGM)
[37] either orally or rectally followed by daily, lower

 maintenance oral doses with a stomach acid suppressant
for 7–8 weeks. A stomach-acid suppressant was used to
increase the survival of SHGM through the stomach.
Participants were followed for an additional 8 weeks
after treatment ended, to determine if treatment effects
were temporary or long-lasting. This report focuses on
the safety and tolerability of MTT and its effects on
microbiota,
GI
symptoms,
and
other
ASD-related
symptoms.
Methods
Goal
The goals of the study were to follow gut microbiota in
healthy and treated children with ASD longitudinally as
well as to evaluate an investigational new treatment,
MTT, for its effectiveness in children with ASD in treating
both GI symptoms (primary outcome) and ASD-related
symptoms (secondary outcomes), and to determine the ef-
fect of MTT on the gut microbiome.
Study design
The general study design was an open-label clinical trial
involving 18 children with ASD (ages 7–16 years) who
were diagnosed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-
Revised (ADI-R) and had moderate to severe gastro-
intestinal problems. FDA limited our pilot study to older
children ages 7–17 years, since most FMT studies have
been conducted on adults, and there was very limited
data and knowledge of the impact and usage of FMT for
younger children. Each child participated in the study for
18 weeks in total, consisting of a 10-week MTT treatment
and an 8-week follow-up observation period after the
treatment stopped. As a control group, 20 age- and
gender-matched neurotypical children without GI disor-
ders were recruited. Neurotypical children were moni-
tored for 18 weeks but not treated. For FMT treatment,
two routes of administration were compared, oral versus
rectal, for the initial dose, followed by a lower mainten-
ance dosage given orally for 7–8 weeks. Participants were
randomly assigned to the two groups but allowed to
switch if they had a strong preference or intolerance re-
garding the mode of administration. The researchers were
not blinded to the group allocation or outcome assess-
ment. Figure 1 illustrates the study design.
Subject recruitment
The study physician first assessed inclusion-exclusion
criteria through an extensive review of the participants’
last 2 years of medical records and height/weight/growth
charts. Once qualified, autism spectrum diagnosis was
verified using the ADI-R, which involved a phone inter-
view of the parents by an ADI-R evaluator. Once qualified
and enrolled, participants engaged in an initial 30-min
meeting which included a general physical health examin-
ation by the study physician and discussion with a project
staff member. Participant exclusion criteria included
antibiotics use in the prior 6 months or probiotics use
in the prior 3 months; dependence on tube feeding; se-
vere GI problems that require immediate treatment
(life-threatening); recent/scheduled surgeries; diagnosed
as severely malnourished or underweight; and diagnosed
with a single-gene disorder, major brain malformations,
ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, or eosino-
philic esophagitis. None of the neurotypical children had

 been diagnosed with mental disorders including ASD,
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depres-
sion, or anxiety. None of the neurotypical children had
first-degree relatives (i.e., parents and siblings) with ASD.
From participants, initial blood and stool samples were
collected. Parents were asked to complete a 1-week diet
assessment on behalf of their child at the beginning of the
study. Participants were recruited primarily from the
greater Phoenix, Arizona area; three were from outside that
area. Neurotypical families were recruited from friends of
the ASD families and professionals who work with ASD
families.
Intervention
The MTT treatment protocol consisted of four key parts:
(1) oral vancomycin, (2) MoviPrep, (3) SHGM, and (4)
Prilosec. As summarized in Fig. 1, the treatment began
with 14 days of oral vancomycin, a non-absorbable broad
spectrum antibiotic that stays in the GI tract. A 14-day
course of vancomycin was used to ensure that pathogenic
bacteria were profoundly suppressed. Prilosec (an acid
pump inhibitor) was administered starting on the 12th
day of vancomycin, and continued until the end of the
lower dosage of SHGM in order to reduce stomach acidity
and increase the survival rate of SHGM through the stom-
ach. On day 15, parents administered MoviPrep, a drink
that flushes the bowels, to remove most remaining gut
bacteria and vancomycin. To enhance its effectiveness, a
fasting period of 1 day was implemented during which
participants were only allowed to consume clear liquids
(children under 12 years were allowed a light breakfast),
and then at 4 pm and 8 pm, parents administered the two
doses of MoviPrep. On day 16, the participants began ei-
ther oral administration of SHGM (2.5 × 1012 cells/day)
mixed in a chocolate milk, milk substitute, or juice for
2 days (divided into three daily doses), or a single rectal
dose of SHGM (2.5 × 1012 cells), given similar to an
enema. The rectal dose was administered slowly over 1 h,
and participants remained prone for at least several hours,
and delayed defecation for at least several hours. The rec-
tal dose was administered under the direct supervision of
the study physician, and the first oral dose was similarly
administered in the presence of the physician. Participants
were randomly assigned to either the oral or rectal route
of administration. If one administration route was not tol-
erated, or if the family preferred the other route, then par-
ticipants had the option of trying the other route. For
participants who received the major initial rectal dose,
they waited for 1 week (so the effect of the rectal dose
could be evaluated by itself) and then received a lower
oral maintenance dose (2.5 × 109 cells) for 7 weeks. In
contrast, for participants who received major initial oral
doses, they received a lower oral maintenance dose
(2.5 × 109 cells) for 8 weeks, directly after the major
initial oral dose. The lower maintenance SHGM doses
were self-administered orally every day up to the end of
week 10. After treatment was stopped, participants
were monitored for another 8 weeks.
Standardized human gut microbiota
Instead of pure stool, this study involved the use of stan-
dardized human gut microbiota that is > 99% bacteria
and prepared as previously described using stool from
healthy individuals as starting material [37]. Briefly, do-
nors underwent rigorous screening that involved regular
questionnaires, review of medical history, and physical
examinations to rule out infectious disease, metabolic
syndrome, gastrointestinal disorders, and neurologic or
neurodevelopmental problems. Serologic testing was per-
formed to rule out infection with human immunodefi-
ciency virus-1 and -2; hepatitis A, B, and C; and syphilis.
The stool used in preparation was tested for potential bac-
terial pathogens (C. difficile toxin B, Campylobacter, Sal-
monella, toxin-producing Escherichia coli,Vibrio, Yersinia,
Listeria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), potential parasites
(Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, and Isospora), and
potential viral infections (Rotavirus A, Adenovirus, and
Norovirus). Metabolic health of donor individuals was
assessed with physical examinations and serologic testing
(fasting glucose, lipid panel, liver function tests, and high
sensitivity C-reactive protein). In addition, the fluorescent
antinuclear antibody was employed as a screen for
autoimmunity risk. Any single abnormality resulted in
disqualification of the donor and prevents material release.
The donated material was then extensively filtered and
standardized under anaerobic conditions, following FDA
good manufacturing processes (GMP), resulting in > 99%
microbiota. The final product was in liquid form which
can be frozen and was proven to be highly effective for
treating C. difficile [37]. The SHGM was stored in −80 °C
freezers at Arizona State University (ASU), and then deliv-
ered to families on dry ice every week during the study.
Families were instructed to keep the SHGM in a container
with dry ice and thaw it shortly before use.
Participants received two different doses of SHGM;
the high major dose and a lower maintenance dose. The
high-dose SHGM was at a daily dosage of 2.5 × 1012 cells,
with 2 days for oral and 1 day for rectal administration.
The rationale for the high dose was that after the Movi-
Prep, 1-day fast is presumably the most critical time in
which to provide new beneficial bacteria. The mainten-
ance dose of SHGM for the following 7–8 weeks was
2.5 × 109 cells/day.
Evaluation and sample collection
Parents were asked to collect stool samples from their
child on approximately 0, 21, 70, and 126 days and to
Kang et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:10 
Page 4 of 16
 collect fecal swabs bi-weekly on 0, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70,
84, 98, 112, and 126 days. The stool samples were ana-
lyzed to determine the types and amounts of gut micro-
biota present. For safety tests, blood samples were
collected on approximately 0, 19, 33, and 74 days. Dur-
ing the study, the participants met with the physician for
an initial physical evaluation (including review of med-
ical history) and following evaluations on 16, 30, and
74 days. The physician had a phone consult with families
on 7, 21, 42, and 130 days, and more frequently if adverse
symptoms occurred, or if families had any questions. Neu-
rotypical participants did not receive any treatment. They
simply provided stool samples (at weeks 0 and 19) and
swab samples every 2 weeks for 4 months.
Assessments of gastrointestinal symptoms
Parents/guardians were asked to fill in the Gastrointes-
tinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and the daily stool
records (DSR). The GSRS is an assessment of GI symp-
toms during the previous week, based on 15 questions,
which are then scored in five domains: abdominal pain,
reflux, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation. A score
for each domain was reported based on the average
within the questions in that domain. The original GSRS
used a 4-point scale, but this study employed a revised
version which included 7-point Likert scale which also
has simpler language [38]. The GSRS were assessed on
0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 74, and 130 days, and the
children with ASD were defined as non-responders
when they achieved less than 50% reduction in the aver-
age GSRS. The baseline DSR was collected daily, for
2 weeks, during the treatment phase, and the last 2 weeks
of the observation period. The DSR primarily included
a rating of the stool using the Bristol Stool Form scale
(1 = very hard, 7 = liquid).
Assessments of autism and related symptoms
The ADI-R is a 2-h structured interview and is one of
the primary tools used for clinical diagnosis of autism
and autism spectrum disorders. It is not designed to be
a measure of autism severity but higher scores are gener-
ally consistent with more severe symptoms [39]. The
ADI-R was used to verify the diagnosis of ASD for ad-
mission into the study. The Parent Global Impressions-
III (PGI-III) was introduced here as an expanded version
of PGI-R [40] by using a 7-point scale ranging from
“much worse” to “much better.” An “average change” is
calculated by computing the average in all 18 scores of
the PGI-III-final. This tool was chosen because it was
found to be more reliable to ask parents directly about
observed changes than to have them estimate symptom
severity at beginning and end and then compute a differ-
ence [40]. Also, the use of a 7-point scale to detect
changes seems to yield a high sensitivity to changes. The
Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is a 15-item
scale that can be used to both diagnose autism and ASD
and assess the overall severity of the symptoms. The Aber-
rant Behavior Checklist (ABC) assesses problem behaviors
in five areas common in children with ASD, including ir-
ritability, lethargy, stereotypy, hyperactivity, and inappro-
priate speech. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a
65-item scale that assesses social impairments, a core issue
in autism, including social awareness, social information
processing, capacity for reciprocal social communication,
social anxiety/avoidance, and autistic preoccupations and
traits. The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II (VABS-II)
is a measure of the functioning level in four different
domains: communication, daily living skills, socialization,
and motor skills, and 11 sub-domains. The raw scores
were converted into an age equivalent score. Its assess-
ment of adaptive skills complements the ABC, which as-
sesses problem behaviors.
PGI-III on 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 74, and 130 days
and the CARS, ABC, and SRS at baseline, at the end of
treatment, and at the end of the observation period were
assessed, whereas the VABS-II was assessed at baseline
and at the end of the observation period only, because it
is lengthy and likely less sensitive to short time periods
since it assesses changes in specific adaptive skills. The
same professional evaluator assessed the ADI-R and the
CARS, and parents assessed the PGI-III, ABC, SRS, and
VABS-II.
Microbial DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing
Microbial DNA was extracted from feces, swabs, and
donor samples using the PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit
(Mobio Carlsbard, CA). A 16S rRNA library for MiSeq
Illumina platform was prepared according to the protocol
from Earth Microbiome Project (http://www.earthmicro
biome.org/emp-standard-protocols/). The barcoded pri-
mer set 515f-806r were used for pair-ended sequencing to
target the 16S rRNA V4 region [41]. Library preparation
and sequencing work were performed at the Microbiome
Analysis Laboratory in the Swette Center for Environ-
mental
Biotechnology
(http://krajmalnik.environmental
biotechnology.org/microbiome-lab.html). These primers
amplify both bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes.
Archaea-specific changes were not observed and are not
discussed in this manuscript.
Microbiome bioinformatics
Microbiome sequencing data were analyzed using Quan-
titative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) 1.9.1
[42], biom-format version 2.1.5 [43], VSEARCH version
1.7.0 (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch), SSU-ALIGN
0.1 [44], and FastTree [45], as well as custom analytic
software (source code at https://github.com/caporaso-
lab/autism-fmt1) being prepared for release in QIIME 2.

 Sequence
quality
control
and
demultiplexing
using
QIIME’s split_libraries_fastq.py with default parameters
was performed as described in Bokulich et al. [46] on a
per-run basis. The sequences were combined across runs
by merging the resulting files using the cat Unix com-
mand, and sequences were clustered into operational taxo-
nomic units (OTUs) at sequence similarities of 100 and
97%. One-hundred percent OTUs were computed using a
pipeline designed for this study. First, sequences were
clustered into 100% OTUs with VSEARCH, and the
resulting data were loaded into a BIOM table using the
biom from-uc command. OTUs that occurred in only one
sample were filtered from the table for computational effi-
ciency. OTU representative sequences were aligned with
ssu-align, and high entropy positions were filtered with
ssu-mask. A phylogenetic tree of representative sequences
was built using FastTreeMP for use in phylogenetic diver-
sity analyses, and representative sequences were taxonom-
ically annotated using QIIME’s RDP Classifier wrapper
against the Greengenes 13_5 reference database. After fil-
tering OTUs that were observed in only a single sample, a
median of 28,486 sequences per sample was observed.
Alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using
QIIME’s core_diversity_analyses.py, at rarefaction depths
of 5721 (to retain as many samples as possible) and
10,000 to confirm that the results were similar with more
sequences per sample. In a parallel analysis, OTUs were
clustered at 97% similarity using QIIME’s pick_open_re-
ference_otus.py with the Greengenes 13_5 reference data-
base and default parameters. Engraftment analyses were
performed by using custom software that is provided in the
GitHub repository referenced above. Statistics were per-
formed using scipy 0.17.0, visualizations were created with
seaborn 0.6.0, and all analyses were performed using Project
Jupyter (notebook version 4.0.6).
Isolation and sequencing of viral DNA
Viral DNA was isolated from stool samples as previously
described by Minot et al. [47] with slight modifications.
Briefly, 0.5 g of stool was resuspended into 40 mL of SM
buffer, spun down at 4000 rpm for 30 min, and filtered
the supernatant at 0.2 μm. The filtrate was ultra-
centrifuged through a CsCl step gradient as detailed in
Thurber et al. [48]. To target dsDNA bacteriophages,
the 1.35–1.5 g/mL fraction was collected from the CsCl
column and was treated with chloroform and then with
DNase I (100 U/mL) followed by the addition of 0.1 M
EDTA and 0.1 M EGTA to halt enzyme activity as de-
scribed [49]. Viral DNA was then extracted using the
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit. Following DNA extraction,
the sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nexter-
aXT kit with two minor changes. During the library
preparation, input DNA was PCR amplified with 18–
25 cycles. When input DNA concentrations were low,
the buffer ATM was added at a 1:10 dilution. Sequen-
cing was carried out on a MiSeq v3 2 × 300 at one sixth
of a lane per sequencing library.
Virome bioinformatics
The quality control was performed on sequence reads
using Trimmomatic [50] to remove adaptors, trim low-
quality ends of reads (reads were cut as soon as the base
quality dropped below 20 on a 4 bp window), and
discard short reads (< 50 bp). Then, the reads were
assembled from each sample using Idba_ud [51] with
kmer size varying from 20 to 100 by increment of 10.
The assembled contigs were screened with VirSorter
[52] to identify and remove all microbial genomes se-
quences (i.e., all contigs >10 kb and not detected as
viral by VirSorter in “virome decontamination” mode).
Then, a non-redundant dataset of viral contigs was
generated by clustering all viral contigs with Cd-hit
[53] using the thresholds previously established (95%
ANI on 80% of the shortest sequence) [54, 55]. This
resulted in 4759 non-redundant viral sequences longer
than 10 kb.
Analyses of viral populations
To determine the viral population relative abundances
in the initial samples, the QC reads were mapped back
to this non-redundant contigs database with bowtie2
(option—non-deterministic and non-sensitive, default
otherwise) [56]. A contig was considered as detected in a
sample if covered by reads on more than 75% of its
length, and its abundance was computed as the contig
average coverage (number of base pairs mapped to the
contig divided by contig length) normalized by the total
number of base pairs sequenced in the metagenome
[56]. The diversity indices, Shannon’s H′ and Peilou’s J,
and Bray-Curtis distances were calculated by using the
vegan package [57] in R version 3.2.3 [58]. Bray-Curtis
distances were statistically ordinated using the nonmet-
ric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and then evaluated
the influence of the metadata on sample ordination
using the “envfit” function with a total of 9999 permuta-
tions in the vegan package. Engraftment analyses were
performed by using custom Perl scripts. The scripts can
be found in the project’s GitHub repository. Viral genes
for each viral population were predicted using Prodigal
(https://github.com/hyattpd/prodigal/releases/). A blastx
for all identified viral genes was performed against the
Viral Protein RefSeq to obtain the top three hits with a
bitscore of > 50. The familial taxonomy was then ob-
tained for the three hits for each protein. If more than
two of the hits had the same familial taxonomy, the viral
protein was then assigned that taxonomy. To assign
viral taxonomy to the whole viral contig, > 50% of
the genes within the contig had to have the same

 familial taxonomy. To determine if a viral population
was similar to the core viral dataset in Manrique et
al. [59], the core contigs genomes were obtained from
Manrique et al. and used as a blast database. A blastn
of the 1651 viral populations in this dataset was per-
formed against the core 23 phage contigs. If a popu-
lations had a blastn alignment length of > 500 bp to
one the 23 core gut phage contigs at a percent iden-
tify greater than 75%, it was considered related to the
core 23 phage contigs.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was not utilized to predetermine sam-
ple size, since the effect size was unknown. Instead, the
study was designed based on our previous research in
which statistically significant differences within a similar
sample size were detected [21]. The previous study was
a case-control comparison that did not include an inter-
vention, and so similar or larger differences were assumed
to appear as a result of treatment. Since the sample size
is still relatively small, and the data are assumed as
non-normally distributed, nonparametric analyses were
performed, including the Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test, and Spearman’s correlation test. All
p values reported in the study were from two-tailed
tests, except the hypothesis on low fiber consumption
and low microbial diversity in children with ASD at
baseline. p values lower than 0.05 were accepted as
significant in clinical data analysis. All p values for
bacterial microbiome analyses were corrected using
the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correc-
tion, and the resulting corrected values were referred
to as q values. q values lower than 0.05 were accepted
as significant. For some previously hypothesized beneficial
bacteria (Bifidobacterium and Prevotella), q values were
not significant, but they were considered to be suggestive
of statistical significance (q values less than 0.1 but greater
than 0.05). Statistical significance of variance is reported
as indicated per experiment in figure legends. All center
values in the box plots are median. The top and bottom
edges of the box are of the 75th and 25th percentiles of
the sample. p values for the phageome analyses are per-
mutation p values calculated from 9999 randomized
permutations, with p values lower than 0.05 accepted
as significant.
Results and discussion
Subject characteristics
Eighteen children with ASD each from a different family
and 20 neurotypical children from 13 families (6 families
had 1 neurotypical participant and 7 families had 2 neu-
rotypical participants) were enrolled in the study reported
here. All ASD participants completed the 18-week
treatment study (neurotypical children were not treated).
Neurotypical children had no first-degree relatives of indi-
viduals with ASD. Participants in both groups were of
similar age, gender distribution, and body mass index
(BMI), but the ASD group had more individuals that were
delivered by C-section, used non-standard formula during
infancy, and had food allergies and eczema (Additional
file 1: Table S1). Children with ASD had marginally
lower fiber consumption (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U
test, p = 0.07), and their mothers also had significantly
lower fiber consumption compared with mothers of
neurotypical children (two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test,
p < 0.01). Children with ASD were breastfed significantly
shorter time than neurotypical children (two-tailed Mann-
Whitney U test, p < 0.05). Consumptions on carbohydrate,
fat, protein, and calorie were comparable between chil-
dren with ASD and neurotypical children (Additional file
1: Table S1). Other larger studies reported that children
with ASD had more antibiotics administered during the
first few years of life [11], but this ASD group reported a
comparable number of antibiotic administrations to the
control group during the first 4 years of life (Additional
file 1: Table S1). Children with ASD who had moderate or
severe GI problems were recruited, which reflected higher
GSRS scores in the ASD group than the control group. A
summary on participants’ characteristics and their medical
and diet history is listed in Additional file 2: Dataset S1.
GI and ASD evaluations
Substantial changes in GI and ASD symptoms were
observed. GI symptoms, as assessed by the GSRS, sig-
nificantly improved for abdominal pain, indigestion,
diarrhea, and constipation (Fig. 2a and Additional file 3:
Figure S1a). The average GSRS score dropped 82% from
the beginning to end of the treatment and remained im-
proved (77% decrease from baseline) even 8 weeks after
treatment stopped (two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
p < 0.001). Only two out of 18 children with ASD (11%)
achieved less than 50% reduction in the average GSRS, the
cutoff for improvement, and were designated as non-
responders. Similarly, the DSR showed significant de-
creases in the number of days with abnormal or no stools
(two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.002), and
those improvements were maintained after 8 weeks of no
treatment (Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional
file 3: Figure S1b).

 Beyond these GI improvements, ASD-related behavior
also improved following MTT. The PGI-II assessment,
which evaluates 17 ASD-related symptoms, revealed sig-
nificant improvement during treatment and no reversion
8 weeks after treatment ended (Fig. 2b). Further, a sig-
nificant negative correlation between change in GSRS
and PGI-III (Spearman’s correlation test showed r = −0.59
and p < 0.001, Additional file 3: Figure S2) suggests that
GI symptoms worsen directly with ASD behaviors, and
that these can be altered via MTT. The scores on CARS,
which rates core ASD symptoms, decreased by 22% from
beginning to end of the treatment and 24% (relative to
baseline) after 8 weeks of no treatment (Wilcoxon signed-
rank test, p < 0.001, Fig. 2c). Children with ASD saw im-
provement in their scores in the SRS, which assesses social
skill deficits, and the ABC, which evaluates irritability,
hyperactivity, lethargy, stereotypy, and aberrant speech
(Fig. 2d, e). The VABS-II scoring, which evaluates adaptive
behaviors such as communication, daily living skills, and
socialization, found that the average developmental age
increased by 1.4 years (p < 0.001) and across all sub-
domain areas (Additional file 3: Figure S3) during MTT,
though the final VABS-II age equivalent was still lower
than their chronological age. Finally, MTT appears to be
beneficial for children ages 7–16 years old (no significant
correlations between age and GSRS or CARS improve-
ment), and there was no significant difference in clinical
outcomes between those who received the initial SHGM
dose orally or rectally.
The MTT treatments were generally well-tolerated,
with only temporary adverse effects (primarily mild to
moderate hyperactivity and tantrums/aggression) at the
beginning of vancomycin treatment, no major changes in
blood chemistry or long-term adverse effects were noted.
Detailed information is provided in Additional file 4. The
improvements in GI and ASD symptoms are consistent
with a previous 8-week trial of the use of vancomycin for
treating children with ASD [22], but a key difference is
that in the previous study, benefits were lost within a few
weeks of stopping vancomycin therapy (despite the use of

 standard probiotics in some children), whereas in this
study, the benefits continued for at least 8 weeks. It is also
relevant to note that GI and ASD symptoms slowly im-
proved over the 10-week MTT treatment and 8-week ob-
servation period, since this observation is very different
from FMT treatment for C. difficile, where a single dose
generally leads to recovery within a few days [60]. Thus, it
appears likely that extended treatment with FMT over
many weeks, as done in this study, is necessary to observe
these benefits.
Bacterial changes after MTT
Given these strong clinical responses to MTT, changes
in bacterial and phage diversity in gut samples over time
as well as correlations to clinical data were sought (de-
tails in “Methods” section). Based on the phylogenetic
diversity (PD) index [61], gut bacteria were significantly
less diverse in children with ASD than neurotypical con-
trols at baseline (Fig. 3a; one-tailed Mann-Whitney U
test, p = 0.027), which is consistent with prior work [21].
After major SHGM intervention at week 3, an increase
in diversity compared with baseline was not observed,
suggesting that initial SHGM restored diversity that was
reduced by the vancomycin treatment. Without a con-
trol arm including individuals who are only treated with
vancomycin, we cannot absolutely attribute this recovery
to the SHGM, and a follow-up study with this hypoth-
esis is warranted. At the end of treatment, however, bac-
terial diversity increased in children with ASD (Fig. 3a;
two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank, p < 0.05 and p = 0.001,
respectively), and remained higher than baseline 8 weeks
after treatment stopped, such that median richness at
week 18 was statistically indistinguishable between the
ASD and control groups (Fig. 3a; two-tailed Mann-
Whitney U test, p = 0.78). This increase was observed
in 16 out of 18 individuals including one of the two
non-responders (subjects whose GI symptoms im-
proved less than 50% on the GSRS) (Fig. 3b). Similar re-
sults of initial low diversity, followed by an increase to
those in neurotypical children after MTT, were also ob-
served using a non-phylogenetic metric, Observed OTUs
(Additional file 3: Figure S4). Higher gut bacterial diversity
and richness are commonly associated with healthy status,
presumably due to resilience afforded by higher functional
redundancy [62].
Importantly, the donor bacterial community was at
least partially engrafted in the recipient gut, consistent
with earlier work [63] and a recent study of the efficacy
of FMT [64]. Specifically, the unweighted UniFrac dis-
tance (i.e., a qualitative measure of the dissimilarity of a
pair of microbial communities based on shared OTUs)
between the host gut and their most recent donor sam-
ple significantly decreased over time (Fig. 3c; two-tailed
Mann-Whitney U test p < 0.01 at 3 weeks and p < 0.001
at 10 and 18 weeks) and remained more similar to the
donor’s bacterial community 8 weeks after treatment
stopped. By the end of the treatment (week 10) and
8 weeks after the treatment stopped (week 18), the dis-
tance between the recipient and the donor bacterial
community was less than normal interpersonal bacterial
community variation (in this case, defined by variation
between the neurotypical controls) (Fig. 3c). These sig-
natures of engraftment suggest that MTT overcame
“colonization resistance” [65].
Specific genera that significantly changed in their rela-
tive abundances with treatment included Bifidobacterium,
Prevotella, and Desulfovibrio (Fig. 3e–g and Additional
file 5: Dataset S2). Bifidobacterium was reported to be
underrepresented in children with ASD [7, 21, 66], also
observed in this study at baseline (two-tailed Mann-
Whitney U test p < 0.05), but following MTT, the rela-
tive abundance of Bifidobacterium significantly in-
creased fourfold and became comparable to its relative
abundance in neurotypical children (Fig. 3e). This suggests
strong engraftment by these microbes in particular. Add-
itionally, relative abundances of Prevotella and Desulfo-
vibrio significantly increased after MTT from baseline
to 8 weeks following treatment (Fig. 3f, g). Initially, the
relative abundance of Prevotella was comparable be-
tween neurotypical children and children with ASD at
baseline, which was not consistent with our previous co-
hort study with 20 neurotypical children and 19 children
with ASD [21]. However, the increase in the relative abun-
dance of Prevotella after MTT is consistent with their po-
tentially beneficial role in the gut of children with ASD.
The increased relative abundance of Desulfovibrio is intri-
guing, since their role in the human gut has been con-
troversially proposed as either commensal [21] or
detrimental [18, 67]. Both Prevotella and Desulfovibrio
were on average more abundant in MTT recipients fol-
lowing treatment than in the donor samples, illustrating
that the transferred microbiota changes the gut environ-
ment in a way that is more hospitable to recruit new com-
mensal bacteria. Taken together, these data suggest that
MTT successfully shifts the ASD bacterial community to-
ward that of age/gender-matched healthy controls and to
that of their donors.
Phage community changes after MTT
Since phage analysis is extremely intensive and costly,
and this was a pilot project, an exploratory evaluation of
only a subset of the stool samples mainly focusing on
ASD samples from week 0 and 10 was conducted to de-
termine their phage content. Sample selection was con-
ducted prior to the availability of bacterial 16S rRNA
gene sequencing data, so focus turned to ASD week 10
samples rather than week 18 samples in case the effects
of MTT were not detectable following the termination

 of treatment. Of the detected phage populations, most
(95.64%) were unknown, but the rest were part of the
order Caudovirales, with 2.97% assigned to the family
Siphoviridae, 0.73% to Myoviridae, and 0.67% to Podo-
viridae (Additional file 3: Figure S5). In contrast to the
gut bacteria, phage richness and evenness did not signifi-
cantly change following MTT given the timeframe of
this study (Fig. 4a). This is not surprising given that, at
the population level, phage communities are reliant on
their host communities and, thus, significant changes in

 phage diversity can lag behind bacterial community
changes [68]. Nonetheless, a number of metrics sug-
gested phage communities also responded to MTT as
follows. First, four individuals were tracked longitudin-
ally from week 0 to week 18—three who clinically
responded to MTT and one non-responder. In all cases,
the phage diversity initially decreased (likely due to the
effect of vancomycin treatment on their host) and then
recovered only for the three responders (Fig. 4a). Sec-
ond, community dissimilarity metrics revealed that MTT
resulted in phage communities of children with ASD be-
coming more similar to those from the donor (Fig. 4b).
Permutation-based fitting of subject variables to Bray-
Curtis and Jaccard NMDS plots uncovered significant
clustering based on subject type (e.g., ASD, neutrotypic
(N) and donor; r2 ≥ 0.2120, p ≤ 0.0001, 9999 permutations)
and among ASD subjects based on treatment stage (r2 ≥
0.4021, p ≤ 0.0002, 9999 permutations) and high (r2 ≥
0.2066, p ≤ 0.0149, 9999 permutations) and low (r2 ≥
0.1851, p ≤ 0.0023, 9999 permutations) SHGM doses. Fi-
nally, based on comparisons between starting phage com-
munities and week 10 communities, phage populations
from the donor were found engrafted across all ASD sub-
jects, while the abundance of phage populations originally
in their pre-MTT virome were completely eliminated or
decreased (Fig. 4c).
While the role of phages in the gut is largely under-
studied in comparison to the role of bacteria, this study
and recent research has begun to uncover the potential
role of phages in the gut. In healthy individuals, the gut
virome is highly stable over time [23, 47, 69], with some
phage populations hypothesized to provide a non-host-
derived protective barrier to invading bacterial patho-
gens [70, 71]. While there is high inter-individual vari-
ation [47], recent analyses have identified a distinct
subset of phages that are found across the majority of
healthy individuals [59]. These “healthy” phage popula-
tions represent < 5% of the phage population identified
in our study (Additional file 3: Figure S5). In individuals
with gastrointestinal disease (i.e., ulcerative colitis and
Crohn’s disease), these phage populations represent a
significantly smaller percentage of the gut phage com-
munity [59]. This shift in viral community structure is
hypothesized to allow potentially harmful bacteria and
viruses to proliferate through phage-mediated dysbiosis,
whereby perturbations to the healthy gut phage commu-
nity leads to increased abundances of phages and se-
lected reduction in bacterial species [70–72].
Studies looking at the effects of perturbations in the
gut from Crohn’s disease in humans [73] and from diet
in mice [74] show this response with increased diversity
of phage communities paired with decreased diversity of
the bacterial community. In this study that looks at re-
versing the negative responses to gut perturbations
caused by ASD, no significant changes were observed in
the diversity of the phage community, but an altered
phage community paired with an increase in the diver-
sity of the bacterial community. This suggests that MTT
may be able to reverse phage-mediated dysbiosis of the
ASD gut, though further study is necessary to test this
assertion.
Study limitations and recommendations
Although study observations are noteworthy, the current
open-label trial is not placebo controlled, blinded, or
randomized. Here, we list some limitations and how they
should be addressed in a follow-up blinded trial with a
placebo control arm. First, this exploratory study only
looked at the consequences of the combined treatment
of MTT. Follow-up studies are needed to determine
whether MTT efficacy in our study results solely from
vancomycin, MoviPrep, SHGM, Prilosec, or a combin-
ation of these four factors. Sandler et al. [22] reported a
temporal efficacy of vancomycin treatment in GI and
ASD symptoms, but this study involved a small number
of participants who were younger than 7 years old. Previ-
ous studies have shown that vancomycin [75] and proton
pump inhibitors [76] significantly alter gut microbiota.
Further studies are, however, also essential in order to
clarify how each factor in MTT contributes on changes in
gut microbiota in the context of ASD. Second, in this
study, participants had a range of GI issues, including con-
stipation, diarrhea, and alternating diarrhea/constipation.
Larger studies in future would allow us to look at those
groups separately. Alternatively, a more homogeneous
cohort (e.g., children with shared GI issues and ASD
etiologies and similar ages) would allow for better disen-
tanglement of the signal from inter-individual variation
(See figure on previous page.)

evenness following MTT. In contrast, the non-responder (indicated by a red line) did not recover. b Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of Bray-Curtis
dissimilarity (right; 2D stress = 0.2467) and Jaccard (left; 2D stress = 0.2212) distances reveal that ASD gut bacteriophage communities are more similar
to donor gut bacteriophage communities following both the high and lower SHGM doses. c Analyses of ASD virome composition at week 10 shows
engraftment of donor bacteriophage populations across all ASD subjects. In > 80% of the subjects, the starting (week 0) bacteriophage populations
make up < 20% of the virome at week 10. NR stands for non-responder

 from FMT efficacy, since inter-individual gut bacterial
[77] and viral [47] community variation is high. Third,
since this was an open-label study, the effect on GI and
ASD symptoms are likely to be subject to placebo effects
and should be cautiously interpreted and viewed as pre-
liminary. Fourth, a clinical trial with extended longer ob-
servation period after treatment would help determining
long-term safety and possible benefits. Lastly, a larger
sample size will be essential to clarify associations with
other variables, such as the efficacy of oral versus rectal
administration of the SHGM.
Further, in follow-up studies, continued use of GI and
behavior assessments to carefully track changes in ASD
severities, with some additional modifications, is recom-
mended. In this study, the GSRS, SRS, ABC, PGI-III,
and VABS-II assessments are reported by parents/guard-
ians, consulting with subjects verbally if the subjects
were adolescents. Previous ASD clinical studies have re-
ported disagreement between parent report and that of a
pediatric gastroenterologist in terms of the specific GI
symptoms and diagnoses, for some metrics (e.g., GI as-
sessment instrument—QPGS-Rome III [78]). As a result,
clinical expertise, in addition to parent/subject reports,
could provide more reliable and independent assessments.
Conclusions
Together, these findings suggest that MTT is safe and
well-tolerated in children with ASD ages 7–16 years.
MTT led to significant improvements in both GI- and
ASD-related symptoms, and the improvements were
sustained at least 8 weeks after treatment. Coincident
with these clinical improvements, both microbiota and
phage from the donors appear to have engrafted, at least
partially, in the recipients. This shifted gut microbiota of
children with ASD toward that of neurotypical children
is consistent with the hypothesis that gut microbiota
may be at least partially responsible for GI and ASD
symptoms. While this study was an open-label trial that
is subject to placebo effects, these results are promising
and provide a crucial step for understanding the connec-
tion between the microbiome and ASD. A randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study is the next step
to investigate the value of MTT in treating children with
ASD and GI problems.

also sent a letter so that their personal physicians would double-check
their medications and prepare for the delivery of the vancomycin, Prilosec,
and the fecal transplant. All participants provided informed consent. The
trial is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02504554).
