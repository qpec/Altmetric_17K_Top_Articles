abstract
BACKGROUND: Previous studies identified associations between maternal obesity and 
childhood neurodevelopment, but few examined paternal obesity despite potentially 
distinct genetic/epigenetic effects related to developmental programming.
METHODS: Upstate KIDS (2008–2010) recruited mothers from New York State (excluding New 
York City) at ∼4 months postpartum. Parents completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire 
(ASQ) when their children were 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age corrected for 
gestation. The ASQ is validated to screen for delays in 5 developmental domains (ie, fine 
motor, gross motor, communication, personal-social functioning, and problem-solving 
ability). Analyses included 3759 singletons and 1062 nonrelated twins with ≥1 ASQs 
returned. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by 
using generalized linear mixed models accounting for maternal covariates (ie, age, race, 
education, insurance, marital status, parity, and pregnancy smoking).
RESULTS: Compared with normal/underweight mothers (BMI <25), children of obese mothers 
(26% with BMI ≥30) had increased odds of failing the fine motor domain (aOR 1.67; 
confidence interval 1.12–2.47). The association remained after additional adjustment for 
paternal BMI (1.67; 1.11–2.52). Paternal obesity (29%) was associated with increased risk 
of failing the personal-social domain (1.75; 1.13–2.71), albeit attenuated after adjustment 
for maternal obesity (aOR 1.71; 1.08–2.70). Children whose parents both had BMI ≥35 were 
likely to additionally fail the problem-solving domain (2.93; 1.09–7.85).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that maternal and paternal obesity are each associated with 
specific delays in early childhood development, emphasizing the importance of family 
information when screening child development.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: A high 
proportion (20%–30%) of adults is obese. Studies 
have observed associations between maternal 
obesity and childhood development with increased 
risks of diagnosed disorders, such as autism, but 
few accounted for paternal BMI despite epigenetic 
modifi
 cations associated with obesity.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In this fi
 rst US study to 
prospectively examine both maternal and paternal 
obesity, maternal obesity was associated with delays 
in fi
 ne motor development, whereas paternal obesity 
was associated with delays in personal-social 
functioning, suggesting independent associations.

Approximately 1 in 5 pregnant 
women in the United States 
enter into pregnancy with a BMI 
≥30. 
1 Concerns have risen that 
prepregnancy obesity may be 
adversely associated with childhood 
neurodevelopment. 
2, 
 
3 Potential 
mechanisms include exposure 
to inflammation during prenatal 
brain development, adipokine 
dysregulation, micronutrient 
insufficiency, hyperglycemia, and 
abnormal development of the 
serotonin system.

Evidence regarding the role of 
maternal obesity on childhood 
neurodevelopment was recently 
reviewed. 
2, 
 
3 Most longitudinal 
cohorts observed negative 
associations between maternal 
obesity or increased prepregnancy 
BMI and childhood development 
despite variations in the outcomes 
studied and a wide age range of 
assessment.

showed inconsistent evidence.

Related studies have also examined 
gestational weight gain (GWG) with 
inconsistent findings.

Although maternal obesity has 
been the primary focus of 
research, 
 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
13 evolving evidence 
suggests a possible role for paternal 
obesity.19, 
 
21 In particular, de novo 
mutations and potential shifts in 
epigenetic programming in sperm 
and in placenta increase with 
paternal BMI. 
22 
– 
24 Paternal BMI 
is also important to explore, as it 
could demonstrate specificity of 
associations. Associations similar to 
maternal BMI may suggest residual 
confounding from socioeconomic or 
shared postnatal influences.25 On the 
other hand, dissimilar associations 
can support true intrauterine 
programming specific to maternal 
BMI.
Given few studies of childhood 
neurodevelopment had paternal BMI 
information, 
 
12, 
 
13, 
 
15, 
 
19 and none being 
from the United States, our objective 
was to evaluate associations between 
parental obesity and early childhood 
development up to 3 years of age. 
We accounted for sociodemographic 
and lifestyle factors and examined 
associations with GWG. We 
hypothesized that both maternal and 
paternal obesity would be associated 
with delays in early childhood 
development.
METHODS
Study Design and Population
The Upstate KIDS Study recruited 
5034 women ∼4 months after 
a delivery in New York State 
(excluding New York City) between 
2008 and 2010. The cohort was 
originally established to investigate 
the association between couples’ 
fecundity and early childhood growth 
and development. 
26 Thus, infants 
conceived by infertility treatment 
and multiples were oversampled. 
26 
The primary cohort consists of 
all singletons and 1 randomly 
selected twin of each pair. Triplets 
and quadruplets (n = 134 from 45 
mothers) were excluded due to low 
numbers and a lack of established 
guidance on appropriate GWG for 
mothers in this group. 
27 The New 
York State Department of Health 
and the University at Albany (State 
University of New York) Institutional 
Review Boards approved the 
study, and entered into a reliance 
agreement with the National 
Institutes of Health. Parents provided 
written informed consent.
Developmental Assessment
Development was measured 
by using the Ages and Stages 
Questionnaire (ASQ), which is a 
validated screening instrument 
for identifying developmental 
delays. 
28, 
 
29 The ASQ encourages 
parents to perform activities 
with their children and then 
respond to questions capturing 5 
developmental domains (ie, fine 
motor, gross motor, communication, 
personal-social functioning, and 
problem-solving ability). Parents 
completed the ASQ at 4 to 6, 8, 12, 
18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age, 
corrected for gestational age. 
30, 
 
31 
We implemented the ASQ second 
edition31 at ages 4 to 12 months and 
the third edition 
30 from 18 months 
onward. Each questionnaire item 
was scored. Failing scores were 
defined as scores 2 SDs below the 
mean for the child’s age per ASQ 
instructions. 
30, 
 
31 Parents were 
contacted to administer a follow-up 
screen for any failed domain(s) by 
using an age-appropriate ASQ as 
recommended by the instrument. 
29 
The child was considered to have 
failed the domain only if she or he 
also failed the follow-up screen or 
if the parent was not reachable. 
Screening instruments were 
considered valid only if completed 
in the specified age windows.30, 
 
31 A 
total of 3759 singletons and 1062 
nonrelated twins with ASQ data who 
returned for ≥1 time point were 
included in the analyses (n = 168, 
3% excluded).
Parental Obesity and GWG
At enrollment, mothers completed 
a questionnaire about health status 
and lifestyle. Questions included 
information regarding both parents’ 
height and weight, maternal weight 
before pregnancy, and total GWG. 
Maternal prepregnancy weight, 
weight at delivery, and height also 
were extracted from electronic birth 
certificates. Prepregnancy weight 
and height were used to calculate 
prepregnancy BMI. Birth certificate 
information for maternal BMI was 
prioritized and augmented with 
maternal self-reported information 
where missing (1.6%). Paternal 
BMI was calculated from weight 
and height as reported by mothers. 
BMI categories were based on 
World Health Organization cutoffs 
(as specified in  
Table 1) except 148 
underweight mothers were grouped 
with normal weight.
GWG was calculated as the delivery 
weight minus prepregnancy weight

from birth certificates and total 
weight gain from maternal report 
used only where missing (2.4%). 
GWG was categorized based on the 
Institute of Medicine criteria for 
inadequate and excessive weight gain 
specified for plurality and obesity 
categories. 
27
Covariates
Covariate information came 
from vital records (ie, maternal 
and paternal age, insurance 
status, plurality, parity, birth 
weight, and gestational age) 
or by baseline maternal report 
with retrospectively reported 
information on the pregnancy at 
4 months postpartum (ie, marital 
status, race, education, pregnancy 
smoking, alcohol use, multivitamin 
use, and fish oil [omega-3 fatty 
acid] supplementation). Pregnancy 
complications were identified

Statistical Methods
Participant characteristics relative 
to maternal obesity categories were 
compared by using χ2 and t tests 
among the primary cohort. We 
evaluated the associations between 
parental BMI categories with failing 
any ASQ domain (yes/no) and 
separately by each of the 5 domains. 
We used generalized linear mixed 
models with a logit function and 
random effect to estimate the odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) of these associations. 
34 
These models use children’s repeated 
ASQ pass/fail information over 
time. To assess a potential nonlinear 
trajectory, we estimated the odds of 
failure relative to categorical time. 
The ORs denote the association 
between BMI category and odds for 
failing an ASQ accounting for time 
of assessment and other covariates. 
Fixed effects were assessed with 
robust SEs. Results were further 
stratified by plurality. Sampling 
weights were applied to account for 
the study’s design of oversampling 
infants conceived with infertility 
treatment and twins. 
26 Weights 
were based on New York State birth 
certificate data for all infants born 
during the period of recruitment. 
Longitudinal methods accounted 
for varying developmental stages 
over follow-up, allowing flexibility of 
children to fail at any point in time.
Parental BMI was first examined 
by comparing overweight and 
obese groups with the normal/
underweight groups. We separately 
investigated obese class I and obese 
class II/III groups. Maternal obesity 
was examined with and without 
adjustment for paternal BMI. Paternal 
obesity was examined in a similar 
fashion. The interaction of the 2 was 
examined by creating a 9-category 
variable that crossed maternal and 
paternal BMI categories such that 
children whose parents both had BMI 
≤25 served as the reference group 
and children with both parents of 
BMI ≥35 was the highest exposure 
group. GWG was modeled with 
the adequate weight gain group as 
reference.
A priori factors known to be 
associated with development 
35, 
 
36 
and associated with maternal 
obesity were adjusted for, including 
maternal age, race/ethnicity, 
education, insurance, married/
living as married, previous live 
birth, and pregnancy smoking. 
We did not adjust for infertility 
treatment because we previously 
did not identify associations. 
29 Fish 
oil supplementation, multivitamin 
use, and the Townsend index 
were added in separate models 
but did not alter associations 
and were not retained in final 
statistical models (data not shown). 
Multiple imputations completed 
missing data on paternal BMI 
(11%), marital status (n = 4%), 
fish oil (3%), multivitamin use 
(3%), parity (n <1%), drinking 
(n <1%), smoking (n <1%), and 
insurance status (n <1%). We 
imputed missing covariate data by 
generating 25 imputed data sets 
by using the MICE algorithm in 
R. 
37 The procedure specifies the 
multivariate imputation model on 
a variable-by-variable basis by a 
set of conditional densities, one for 
each incomplete variable. Auxiliary 
variables informing imputation 
included all parental variables 
from Table 1 (except breastfeeding 
and postpartum depression). We 
assumed that the data are missing 
at random; that is, missing with 
respect to observed data accounted 
for in our models. All other analyses 
were conducted with SAS version 
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Maternal obesity was associated 
with lower socioeconomic status 
and higher paternal BMI ( 
Table 1). It 
was also related to greater likelihood 
of smoking, being diagnosed with 
gestational diabetes or hypertension, 
and lower likelihood of alcohol 
intake, multivitamin use, and fish oil 
supplementation during pregnancy. 
Loss to follow-up was low (<6%) but 
responses differed by obesity status 
(Supplemental Table 6). A higher 
percentage of the children of obese 
women failed the ASQ than children 
of nonobese women.
In unadjusted analyses, maternal 
obesity (BMI ≥30) was associated 
with higher odds of failing most 
domains but only the fine motor 
domain remained significant after 
adjustment for covariates and 
paternal BMI (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] 1.67; 1.12–2.47) ( 
Table 2). 
Associations of similar magnitude 
with the fine motor domain were 
observed among singletons (1.69; 
1.10–2.58) and twins (1.97; 1.07–
3.64; Supplemental Table 7). No 
associations were observed for the 
overweight category of prepregnancy 
BMI 25 to 30. Although associations 
reached significance at class II/
III obesity category, risks were 
elevated for class I as well (aOR 1.60; 
0.97–2.64), suggesting an overall 
association between obesity more 
generally (BMI ≥30) than only at 
higher levels (BMI ≥35). The fine 
motor association with maternal 
obesity also was similar among 
boys (aOR 1.63) and girls (aOR 1.61, 
P-interaction = .83).
We then evaluated paternal obesity 
(BMI ≥30) and found a significant 
increased risk of failing the personal-
social domain (aOR 1.75; 1.13–2.71) 
compared with children of normal-
weight fathers ( 
Table 3). Neither 
further adjustment for maternal 
obesity (aOR 1.71; 1.08–2.70) nor 
replacing maternal covariates with 
paternal information (ie, paternal 
age, education, and race) (aOR 1.71;

association was primarily among 
singletons (aOR 1.76; 1.12–2.77) 
rather than twins (aOR 1.16; 
0.54–2.48). Both class I and class 
II paternal obesity had similar 
associations with the personal-
social domain (aOR 1.70; 1.01–
2.86 and 1.77; 0.93–3.34, among 
singletons, respectively). No sex 
interactions were observed (data not 
shown).
Children of 2 parents with class II/III 
obesity (BMI ≥35) had higher odds 
of failing multiple domains (ie, fine 
motor, personal-social, and problem 
solving) even after adjusting for 
covariates compared with children 
of normal/underweight parents 
( 
Table 4). When a BMI of 30 (ie, any 
obesity) was used instead of 35 (ie, 
class II/III obesity) for both parents, 
the fine motor and personal-social 
domains remained significantly 
associated with higher odds (aOR 
2.10; 1.13–3.93 and 2.12; 1.14–3.95, 
respectively), but the problem-
solving domain was not (aOR 1.58; 
0.79–3.18). Because of the smaller 
numbers of twins, we could not 
conduct analysis among them with 9 
parental obesity groups.
Compared with adequate GWG, 
inadequate GWG was associated 
with increased risk of failing any 
developmental domain (aOR 1.40; 
1.02–1.91), particularly among 
singletons ( 
Table 5). Further 
adjusting for birth weight reduced 
the association (aOR 1.21; 0.86–
1.71). Domain-specific fails did not 
reach statistical significance unless 
restricted to mothers who were 
normal weight. Among normal-
weight women, inadequate GWG was

associated with gross motor (aOR 
2.45; 1.29–4.65) and personal-social 
fails (aOR 1.87; 1.05–3.34). These 
associations were also not significant 
after additional adjustment for birth

GWG was protective among twins for

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, Upstate KIDS is 
the first study in the United States to 
evaluate both paternal and maternal 
BMI with respect to early childhood 
development among singletons and 
twins. Given that the prevalence of 
obesity is approximately double in 
the United States 
1 as in Europe, 
 
38 
and that class II/III obesity (BMI 
≥35) in both parents may be most 
concerning, the relevance of findings 
to a US population is important. 
Inclusion of twins was also unique, 
as previous investigations frequently 
excluded them. Our findings show 
that maternal and paternal obesity 
may be differentially associated with 
developmental domains: maternal 
obesity being associated with fine 
motor skills and paternal with 
personal-social development. The 
latter association, however, was 
observed only among singletons and 
not twins. When both parents had 
BMI of ≥35, an additional association 
with the problem-solving domain 
emerged.
Our finding regarding maternal 
obesity and fine motor 
developmental delay agree with 
results from other cohorts, which 
evaluated children’s development 
at a younger age. 
13 Psychomotor 
scores (and only those reflecting fine 
motor) were inversely associated 
with maternal BMI and not for 
paternal BMI. 
13 The study also found 
an inverse association with cognitive 
scores. 
13 However, our findings do 
not support a previous US study on 
maternal obesity. Specifically, at 2 
years (n = 6850), the study found

no association with psychomotor 
development (encompassing fine and 
gross motor) but observed a relation 
with delayed mental development. 
5 
We had previously found that 
maternal obesity was associated with 
delayed developmental milestones, 
such as a longer time to sitting 
alone and crawling39; however, no 
associations were found with later 
milestones involving standing or 
walking alone. 
39 The lack of longer-
term association is consistent with 
our current investigations of gross 
motor development. Apart from these 
studies, many studies measured 
cognitive abilities, 
 
7 
– 
9,

17, 
 
20 such 
as IQ or autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), 
 
10, 
14, 
 
19, 
 
21 which are difficult to 
directly compare with our results, 
as these neurodevelopmental 
phenotypes were not assessed 
in this study. We did not observe 
increased odds of problem-solving 
domain fails until both paternal and 
maternal weight were in the obese 
class II/III categories. Contrarily, 2 
European birth cohorts did not find 
consistent associations between 
maternal overweight and child 
cognition and behavior as measured 
by several validated instruments. 
15 
The difference in findings may 
be explained by their assessing 
overweight rather than obesity, 
even though the latter seems to 
be more indicative of long-term 
impact, suggesting a threshold 
effect. 
6 Residual confounding 
remains an issue. A large linkage 
study in Sweden observed that 
maternal obesity was associated 
with risk of offspring autism but 
not after analyses were restricted 
to siblings, suggesting associations 
may not be causal and that familial 
risk factors that are incompletely 
controlled for may still play a role.19 
Alternatively, some studies have 
found that childhood obesity itself 
may be related to poorer cognitive 
development. 
40
The potential mechanisms explaining 
how maternal obesity may affect 
offspring development, largely drawn 
from animal evidence, has been 
previously reviewed. 
3, 
 
4 Inflammation 
remains a leading explanation. As 
adipocytes accumulate fatty acids 
and become enlarged (ie, adipocyte 
hypertrophy), mechanisms respond 
to restrict their size, including 
upregulating immune cells, which 
lead to increased inflammatory 
cytokines in both maternal and fetal 
circulation. 
4 In a sheep experiment, 
fetuses of obese ewes had increased 
circulation of free fatty acids coupled 
with upregulation of inflammatory 
genes in their placentas compared 
with controls. 
41 To further 
understand causal relationships, 
interventions to counter 
inflammation through dietary 
modification among obese pregnant 
women has been suggested.2
With regard to paternal obesity, we 
had few studies to compare with 
and none in the United States. Of the 
studies abroad that have examined 
paternal and maternal BMI, findings 
were generally null 
13 or were similar 
to maternal obesity with authors 
concluding associations were due 
to residual confounding. 
12, 
 
15 Surén 
and colleagues 
21 found paternal 
rather than maternal obesity to be 
more strongly associated with risk of 
ASD. Our results cannot be directly 
compared with previous studies 
because we evaluated different 
domains of development by using 
the ASQ, a validated screening rather 
than diagnostic tool. Nevertheless, 
our findings provide suggestive 
evidence for a differential role of 
paternal obesity on the personal-
social domain (attributes close to 
those evidenced in ASD). Research 
in embryo development suggests 
that there are potential mechanisms 
through epigenetic alterations to 
sperm that could have downstream 
impact.42 The presence of pleiotropic 
genes that increases risk of both 
ASD and obesity may also explain 
observations. 
21 That there also may 
be synergistic influence of class II/III 
obesity in both parents remains to be 
replicated.

Apart from uniquely having 
information on paternal BMI, 
Upstate KIDS was able to adjust 
for major confounders, including 
socioeconomic status. As with any 
observational design, we cannot 
eliminate residual bias or other 
selection-related factors. However, 
the specificity of the associations 
for maternal and paternal obesity 
suggests that associations were not 
wholly attributed to a shared family 
environment. 
25 We used a validated 
screening tool demonstrated to identify 
early developmental delays, 
 
28, 
 
43 
but did not have systematic 
developmental assessments of all 
children. The ASQ’s sensitivity has 
varied (75%–100%) depending 
on instrument compared. 
28, 
30, 
 
44 
Intraclass correlations 0.75 to 0.82 
were observed for parental test-
retest reliability. 
30 As such, we 
recognize that some children may be 
misclassified on development. We 
also recognize that delays may not 
be permanent, and some children 
may outgrow them. However, as a 
screening instrument, the ASQ has 
been shown to be clinically useful 
in a general population and that 
additional pediatrician input may 
not necessarily increase prediction 
of developmental delay. 
45 It also 
has been shown to help potentially 
identify children for earlier 
intervention, even if not all children 
go on to be eligible for services. 
43 
Making the ASQ available online 
might have aided in receiving timely 
responses and follow-up. We did 
not measure adiposity directly 
but relied on birth certificates and 
maternal report to calculate BMI. 
Birth certificate reports were closer 
to time of delivery, decreasing 
the impact of time on recall and 
therefore used. Birth certificates may 
underestimate obesity, 
46 but such 
misclassification would lead to an 
underestimation of the true effect. 
It remains possible that reporting 
errors may be higher for paternal 
BMI, as it was ascertained from 
mothers. Although there was loss to 
follow-up, 
 
29 generalized linear mixed 
effects models are robust to such 
losses under the missing at random 
assumption. 
34 Our population, which 
was predominantly non-Hispanic 
white and highly educated, may not 
be generalizable to all populations, 
but the prevalence of obesity in the 
cohort was comparable with national 
data.
CONCLUSIONS
In this first examination of maternal 
and paternal obesity in the 
United States on early childhood 
development, maternal obesity was 
associated with delays in fine motor 
development and paternal obesity 
marginally associated with delays 
in personal-social functioning. The 
impact of higher levels of parental 
obesity (ie, having both parents 
with BMI ≥35, which constituted 
3% of our cohort) was most striking 
for multiple domains. Findings 
emphasize the importance of 
family information when screening 
child development as, if replicated 
elsewhere, such information may 
help inform closer monitoring or 
earlier intervention.
