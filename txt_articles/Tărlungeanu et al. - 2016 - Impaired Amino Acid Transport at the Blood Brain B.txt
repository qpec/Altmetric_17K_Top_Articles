SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of
genetic disorders often overlapping with other neuro-
logical conditions. We previously described abnor-
malities in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)
catabolic pathway as a cause of ASD. Here, we show
that the solute carrier transporter 7a5 (SLC7A5), a
large neutral amino acid transporter localized at the
bloodbrainbarrier(BBB),hasanessentialroleinmain-
taining normal levels of brain BCAAs. In mice, deletion
of Slc7a5 from the endothelial cells of the BBB leads to
atypical brain amino acid profile, abnormal mRNA
translation, and severe neurological abnormalities.
Furthermore, we identified several patients with
autistic traits and motor delay carrying deleterious
homozygous mutations in the SLC7A5 gene. Finally,
we demonstrate that BCAA intracerebroventricular
administration ameliorates abnormal behaviors in
adult mutant mice. Our data elucidate a neurological
syndrome defined by SLC7A5 mutations and support
an essential role for the BCAA in human brain function.
INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a group of syndromes of het-
erogeneous etiologies characterized by impairment in social in-
teractions, verbal communication, and repetitive behaviors.
A number of twin and family studies have shown that genetics
play a significant role in the development of ASD (Bailey et al.,
1995; Folstein and Rutter, 1977). However, the genetic architec-
ture of ASD is very complex and mutations in a single gene rarely
account for a significant proportion of ASD patients. Despite
their genetic heterogeneity, ASD may be less diverse function-
ally. Indeed, in many instances the great number of genes impli-
cated in neurological disorders converges on a smaller number
of biological pathways (De Rubeis et al., 2014).
We recently identified mutations in the gene branched chain
keto-acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) in several patients
with ASD, intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy (Novarino
etal.,2012).BCKDKistheenzymeresponsiblefortherate-limiting
step in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids
(BCAAs), a group of essential amino acids comprising valine,
leucine, and isoleucine. The most direct consequence of BCKDK
mutations is a hyper-catabolism of the BCAAs, resulting in abnor-
mally low levels of serum and brain BCAAs (Novarino et al., 2012).
The brain is dependent on a constant supply of BCAAs from
the periphery. Should BCAAs be substantially important for the
brain, factors facilitating BCAA uptake might be critical for the
proper function of the CNS. The large neutral amino acid trans-
porter 1 (LAT1) is encoded by the SLC7A5 gene (Verrey, 2003).
The transporter is localized at the blood brain barrier (BBB)
and forms a heterodimer with the glycoprotein CD98, encoded
by the SLC3A2 gene.
Here, we studied a mouse model in which Slc7a5 was
deleted from the BBB and found that Slc7a5 is particularly

1481
 important to set brain BCAA levels within a normal range. Mice
with defective BCAA transport at the BBB show abnormal acti-
vation of the amino acid response (AAR) pathway and a
corresponding
reduction
in
mRNA
translation
along
with
neuronal activity imbalance and behavioral problems. To probe
whether SLC7A5 is essential also in humans, we performed ge-
netic analysis of a cohort of neurological pediatric patients. We
identified and functionally validated mutations in SLC7A5 in
several patients with ASD and motor coordination problems.
Notably, neurological abnormalities can be treated in adult
mice by 3-week long intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) BCAA
delivery.

RESULTS
SLC7A5 Mediates BCAA Flux at
the BBB
Earlier in vitro studies described the so-
dium-independent LAT1 as a large neutral
amino acid (LNAA) transporter, including
the BCAAs (Mastroberardino et al., 1998).
The light subunit of the carrier, encoded
by SLC7A5, is
sufficient
to
transport
LNAAs (Napolitano
et al.,
2015). The
contribution of SLC7A5 to brain LNAA/
BCAA homeostasis in vivo, however, re-
mains completely unknown.
To understand the physiological role of
Slc7a5 in vivo, we employed a conditional
(floxed) Slc7a5 knock out mouse line
(Slc7a5fl) (Sinclair et al., 2013). In wild-
type (WT) animals, Slc7a5 is considerably
expressed in the plasma membrane of the
endothelial cells of the BBB during devel-
opment and in adulthood but it is mostly
undetectable in other tissues (Figures 1A
and S1A–S1C). Thus, we crossed the
Slc7a5fl mouse with the Tie2Cre mouse
line, expressing the Cre recombinase start-
ing from embryonic day (E) 11.5 in the
endothelial cells of blood vessels and BBB (Figure S1D) (Kisanuki
et al., 2001). As expected, endothelial cells of the BBB of Tie2-
Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice show complete lack of expression of Slc7a5
(Figure 1A).
The exchange between blood and cerebrospinal fluid of a wide
range of metabolically important molecules, including amino
acids, is known to be constrained already at early developmental
stages, arising with the BBB formation. However, some studies
reported that many amino acids, including the BCAAs, are trans-
ported into the developing brain at much higher rate than in
adulthood (Braun et al., 1980; Lefauconnier and Trouve
´ , 1983).
Whether this reflects a greater metabolic demand of the
1482
Cell 167, 1481–1494, December 1, 2016
 developing brain or the immaturity of the BBB is unknown (Wat-
son et al., 2006). Hence, we asked how removal of Slc7a5 from
the BBB affects brain amino acid levels at different develop-
mental stages.
We found that E14.5 Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice don’t show major
changes in brain LNAA and BCAA levels (Figure 1B), suggesting
that either at E14.5 the BBB is still immature, with amino acids
leaking into the brain, or another transporter may regulate
LNAA and BCAA fluxes across the BBB during early develop-
ment. In contrast, after birth and in adult stages, brain BCAA
(especially leucine and isoleucine) levels are abnormally low in
Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl animals (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that
Slc7a5 expression is essential to regulate BCAA uptake by the
brain. Surprisingly, the brain levels of several other LNAAs
(e.g., tyrosine and tryptophan) in Slc7a5 mutants are comparable
to the ranges observed in control (Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/+) animals,
while a few other amino acids (e.g., histidine, serine, and phenyl-
alanine) show an elevated level in mutants compared to controls.
In particular, brain histidine concentration is several fold higher in
the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice than in control animals (Figures 1B–
1D). This result supports the idea that SLC7A5 works as an anti-
porter, and histidine is the main counter amino acid (Figure S2)
(Napolitano et al., 2015).
Thus, in the absence of Slc7a5 expression at the BBB, the
mammalian brain accumulates histidine while failing to gather
normal amounts of BCAAs. Importantly, neither the serum amino
acid profile nor the level of brain neurotransmitters are affected in
the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl animals (Figure S2C; Table S1). While this
last result contradicts previous hypotheses (del Amo et al.,
2008), it is in agreement with our in vitro experiments showing
that SLC7A5 does not facilitate the movement of neurotransmit-
ters (Figures S2A and S2B).
Deletion of Slc7a5 from the BBB Activates the AAR
Signal Transduction Pathway in the Brain
In vitro, SLC7A5 transports not only the BCAAs but also other
LNAAs, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (Na-
politano et al., 2015). However, brain levels of these amino acids
were not reduced in Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice but rather slightly
increased (Figure 1D). This suggests that additional BBB-located
transporters might efficiently compensate for Slc7a5 loss by
mediating the passage of several LNAAs, but not of BCAAs.
Indeed, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse brain revealed a
significant upregulation of Slc7a1 and Slc7a3 genes (Figures
2A and 2B) encoding for the amino acid transporters Cat1 and
Cat3 (Fotiadis et al., 2013). This finding suggests that in vivo
Cat1 and Cat3 may contribute to preserve brain levels of LNAAs,
other than BCAAs, in the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice.
Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis revealed the
upregulation of genes implicated in serine biosynthesis in Tie2-
Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice (Figure 2B), explaining the modest but signifi-
cant increase in brain serine level observed in the mutant animals
(Figure 1D). An increase in the expression of genes encoding for
amino acid transporters and serine biosynthetic enzymes has
been previously linked to the activation of the AAR, a process im-
plemented byindividualcellstorespond toaminoacid deprivation
(Kilberg et al., 2009). Consistently, RNA-seq analysis of Tie2Cre;
Slc7a5fl/fl mouse brain revealed the upregulation of a number of
other amino acid-related genes (e.g., aminoacyl-tRNA synthe-
tases) (Figures 2A and 2B). Among them, we noticed a significant
upregulation of mRNAs encoding for the amino acid responsive
transcriptionfactorsAtf4 and Atf5andtheeukaryoticinitiationfac-
tor 4E binding protein, 4ebp1 (Figure 2A), all part of the AAR
pathway. Atf4 and Atf5 have been implicated in the regulation of
the CNS development and function. Specifically, Atf4 modulates
synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation (Chen et al.,
2003), while Atf5 has been implicated in cell growth and develop-
ment, especially in the nervous system (Angelastro et al., 2003).
Aberrant expression of Atf4 and/or Atf5 has been implicated in
cognitive
dysfunctions
and
neuropsychiatric
abnormalities,
including altered emotional behavior (Green et al., 2008) and
behavioral inflexibility (Trinh et al., 2012).
Importantly, our gene expression analysis did not reveal any
abnormality ascribable to increased histidine levels, suggesting
that, despite histidine being the most affected amino acid by
Slc7a5 deletion, changes in its level do not lead to severe molec-
ular defects. Similarly, we did not detect changes attributable to
alterations of other amino acids such as phenylalanine.
Altered mRNA Translation in Slc7a5 Mutant Mice
Amino acid deprivation and activated AAR signaling pathway are
associated with suppression of protein synthesis via phosphor-
ylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2a. In the past few
years, several genes regulating mRNA translation have been
implicated in cognitive deficits (Gkogkas et al., 2013; Santini
et al., 2013). We therefore examined the effect of Slc7a5 knock
out at the BBB on translation and associated pathways in the
brain.
To assess the impact of leucine and isoleucine deficiency on
mRNA translation in the brain of Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice, we first
performed western blot analysis of neocortical lysates obtained
from wild-type and mutant animals. Specifically, we evaluated
the expression and activity status of a number of proteins involved
in the regulation of protein synthesis (Figure 2C). We observed a
significant increase in the total levels of 4EBP1 protein (Figure 2C),
consistent with increased 4EBP1 mRNA levels seen in our RNA-
seq data (Figure 2A) and of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation
factor 2 alpha (eIF2a) (Figure 2C), indicating that removal of
Slc7a5 from the BBB and the consequent decrease in brain
BCAA concentration may lead to the suppression of cap-depen-
dent translation initiation. In contrast, in none of our experiments
did we detect abnormal activation of the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Figure 2C), whose activity was
shown to be regulated by leucine levels in vitro (Wolfson et al.,
2016). This may suggest that in vivo, under chronic leucine defi-
ciency, the mTOR complex is alternatively regulated.
To test whether abnormal regulation of 4EBP1 and eIF2a in
mice lacking Slc7a5 leads to changes in translation efficiency
in the brain, we performed polysome profiling of wild-type and
Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl
cortices.
Importantly,
in
Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl
mouse cortical lysates, we observed a significant shift of ribo-
somes from actively translating polysomes toward the monoso-
mal fraction (Figure 2D), the hallmark of decreased translation
initiation. We conclude that BCAA shortage and associated ef-
fects of 4EBP1 levels and increased eIF2a phosphorylation elicit
deficient translation initiation in the brain.

 Slc7a5 Conditional Knock Out Animals Show Motor
Delay and Autism-Related Phenotypes
Behavioral impairments resulting from abnormal regulation of
cap-dependent translation have been previously described
(Banko and Klann, 2008; Santini et al., 2013; Trinh et al., 2012).
Thus, we tested Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice for global behavioral
changes. Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice are born at Mendelian ratio
and appear normal in size but display kyphosis (44% of mutant
mice) and hind limb clasping (89% of mutant mice). In an open
field, Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice show reduced explorative behavior
and lower velocity (Figure 3A). Rearing, a form of vertical explo-
ration, was significantly reduced in the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice
(Figure 3B). Nonetheless, Slc7a5 mutant mice and wild-type lit-
termates have similar habituation time course (Figure S3A), sug-
gesting that the diminished activity results from locomotion
defects rather than a faster habituation to the field. Therefore,

 we tested the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice for fine motor coordination
and locomotion problems. Indeed, Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl animals
presented significant difficulties in the walking beam test (Fig-
ure 3C) and gait abnormalities (Figures 3D and 3E).
Becauseinourpreviouswork,weimplicatedBCAAdeficiencyin
ASD (Novarino et al., 2012),we tested Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl for autism-
like phenotypes. Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl do not show excessive groom-
ing or perseverative behaviors (Figure S3B), activities that can be,
however,severelycomplicatedbythepresenceofmotordeficitsin
the mutants. Thus, we tested Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice for social
interaction abnormalities. We first employed a three-chamber so-
cialarena toprobe the mutant animals for self-initiated interactions
witha wild-type unfamiliarmouse. Thisanalysisrevealedthatwhile
wild-type mice have more close interactions with an unfamiliar
mouse than an object, the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice show no prefer-
ence between these two (Figure 3F). We then tested juvenile ani-
mals for social play and found that Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice tend to
stay farther apart from their cage-mate and display a decreased
number of nose-to-nose contacts (Figure 3G). Finally, we mea-
sured isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted
by mouse pups separated from the mother. Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl
pups display an increased number of USVs starting from P8
when compared with their wild-type littermates (Figure 3H), a
behavior observed in other autism models (Gkogkas et al., 2013).
Interestingly, the excessive number ofUSVs emitted bythe mutant
pups may be due to an increased repetition of a specific repertoire
of vocalization patterns (Romano et al., 2013).
Inhibitory Activity Defects in Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl Mice
Social interaction abnormalities have been suggested to arise
from cortical excitation and inhibition imbalance (Yizhar et al.,
2011), a correlation also observed in animals with abnormal
regulation of translation (Gkogkas et al., 2013; Santini et al.,
2013). We evaluated synaptic function in 21-day-old Tie2Cre;
Slc7a5fl/fl mice using whole-cell recordings of pyramidal neurons
in layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex. Examination of synap-
tic transmission revealed a slight increase in the amplitude of
miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and a
marked reduction in the frequency of miniature inhibitory synap-
tic currents (mIPSCs) (Figured 4A and 4B), indicating a significant
excitation and inhibition imbalance.
To determine whether the synaptic alterations in Tie2Cre;
Slc7a5fl/fl mice are selective to the somatosensory cortex, we
performed the same experiment in other brain regions. Given
the locomotion abnormalities observed in Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl
mice, we tested inputs received by the Purkinje cells. Similarly
to the neocortex, Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mouse cerebellar Purkinje
cells display a significant reduction in mIPSC frequency (Figures
S3C and S3D).
Changesin mIPSC frequency are generally due to differences in
the number of functional synaptic sites and/or in the presynaptic
releaseprobabilityatexistingsites(changesintheGABAvesicular
pool or vesicular turnover rate). Therefore, we examined overall
brain morphology (Figure S4A), cortical layering (Figure S4B),
and inhibitory neuron distribution (Figure S4C) and found that for
these parameters, somatosensory cortices of mutant animals
were undistinguishable from the control. We further looked for dif-
ferences in pre- and postsynaptic markers of inhibitory synapses.
Importantly, we observed that the intensity of the vesicular GABA
transporter (VGAT) staining, a marker for GABAergic presynaptic
terminals, was lower in the somatosensory cortices of Tie2Cre;
Slc7a5fl/fl mice (Figures 4C and S4D). However, the GABAergic
postsynaptic marker neuroligin 2 (Varoqueaux et al., 2004) ap-
peared qualitatively and quantitatively similar in the somatosen-
sory cortex of the mutant and control mice (Figures 4D and
S4E). The marked reduction of VGAT and normal neuroligin 2 pro-
tein levels in Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice were also confirmed by west-
ern blot analysis of cortical lysates (Figure 4E). To determine
whether the reduction in VGAT staining intensity was due to a
specific lessening of VGAT or a decline in the number of VGAT-
containing vesicles, we analyzed inhibitory synapses by electron
microscopy. In agreement with the electrophysiology results, we
detected a significant reduction of vesicle number in symmetric
synapses in the somatosensory cortices of Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl
mice compared with control animals (Figure 4F).

reduced-serum BCAA levels and a marked increase in brain

neurotransmitter concentrations (Figure S5G). Thus, it remained
unclear whether neurological abnormalities in BCKDK mutant
patients and mice are due to alterations in serum or brain
BCAA. Alternatively, the pathological conditions observed in pa-
tients carrying mutations in BCKDK could be due to increased
brain LNAA levels.

(Figures S5A–S5F), and activation of the AAR pathway (Novarino
et al., 2012) implying that Bckdk�/� and Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice
share pathophysiological mechanisms.
SLC7A5 Mutations in Patients with ASD and Motor Delay
Given the essential role of SLC7A5 in regulating brain BCAA ho-
meostasis and the phenotypic overlap between Bckdk and
Slc7a5 mutant mice,wereasoned thatmutationsinSLC7A5 could
lead to ASD and motor abnormalities in humans. Thus, we collab-
oratively screened whole exome sequencing (WES) data from
more than 2,000 families with documented parental consanguin-
ity, presenting with children with various neurological diseases.
We identified two independent families with multiple children
affected by ASD, microcephaly, and motor problems all harboring
homozygous missense mutations in the gene SLC7A5.
Family 1426 is a consanguineous family with two branches
and five affected individuals (Figures 5A–5C). WES analysis of
patients 1426-5 and 1426-19 (Figure 5A) identified a unique
shared homozygous missense variant in the SLC7A5 gene
(Table S2). The homozygous mutation falls in a linkage pick
with LOD score >4 (Figure S6A) and segregates with the disorder
in the rest of the family (confirmed by Sanger sequencing). The
A246V mutation changes a highly conserved alanine situated in
a stretch of preserved amino acids predicted to be important
for amino acid transport (Figures 6A and 6B). In an additional
cohort of 1,000 neurodevelopmental disorder patients analyzed
by WES, we identified Family 1465 including two patients with
identical ASD, microcephaly, and motor delay (Figures 5A–5C)
sharing a predicted deleterious homozygous mutation (Fig-
ure S6B) in SLC7A5 leading to the change of the conserved pro-
line in position 375 to a leucine (P375L) (Figure 6A). Both genetic
variants were not present in more than 200 ethnically-matched,
healthy control chromosomes, nor in our dataset of over 2,000
chromosomes or in publicly available databases (Table S2).
Functional Assessment of SLC7A5 A246V and P375L
Mutations
We mapped the two genetic variants onto a homology model of
SLC7A5 (Geier et al., 2013). A246 is located in transmembrane
helix 6 in close proximity to the extracellular side and to the chan-
nel (Figure 6B). Mutation of this residue to the larger valine is
therefore likely to impact the transporter’s structure by disrupt-
ing helix-helix packing and ligand transport. P375 is located in
transmembrane helix 9 in close proximity to the cytoplasmic
side (Figure 6B). Proline often plays a key role in introducing
kinks in helices and allowing conformational changes important
for transporter function. Thus, mutation of this residue to leucine
is likely to disrupt the flexibility required for transport by SLC7A5.
To validate the functional impact of the A246V and P375L
substitution, we performed transport assays. Therefore, the re-
combinant A246V and P375L mutant proteins were successfully
expressed (Figure S7A), reconstituted in proteoliposomes (Fig-
ures 6C and 6D) and tested with a series of transport assays
(Napolitano et al., 2015).
From transport time course analysis, it was evident that the
mutant A246V was virtually inactive (Figure 6C). As predicted
by the homology model (Figure 6B), the functional defect may
be ascribed to a higher steric hindrance of the valine side chain
with respect to that of alanine. To verify this hypothesis and that
the functional change was specifically ascribed to the patholog-
ical variant, we analyzed an artificial mutant, A246G, (Figure S7A)
in which the 246 side chain had been abolished. In contrast to the
patient-specific A246V mutation, the A246G variant did not show
any transport defect (Figures 6C and S7B). To exclude that the
loss of activity observed in the A246V mutant could be due to
reconstitution failing, we assessed the efficiency of protein
reconstitution. We found no differences in the reconstitution of
the A246V mutant compared to the WT protein (Figure S7A).
Taken together, all the data confirmed that the substitution of
A246V was functionally disruptive.
In contrast, the P375L mutant showed no significant variations
in time-dependent activity and external KM with respect to WT
(Figures S7C and S7D). Owing to the location of P375 in an intra-
cellular moiety of the protein (Figure 6B), we determined also the
internal KM for this mutant (�25 mM; 27 ± 9.9) (Figure S7E). Inter-
estingly, the KM value was approximately five times that of the
WT (�5 mM; 5.2 ± 2.3), suggesting that some variations in the
substrate binding/translocation pathway may occur upon muta-
tion. We further performed efflux experiments for evaluating
possible differences in the antiport reaction catalyzed by

proteoliposomes containing 10 mM His reconstituted with SLC7A5-WT (B), SLC7A5-A246V (solid red square) or SLC7A5-A246G (C) and stopped at the

absence (B, open red square; uniport) or presence of external 1 mM His (C, solid red square; antiport). Percentage of His efflux was calculated with respect to
time 0 (means ± SD; n = 4 experiments).

 SLC7A5. The measurements were performed using intraliposo-
mal histidine concentration (2 mM), to create conditions similar
to the intracellular environment. Surprisingly, the mutant P375L
was mostly uncoupled. Indeed, while WT showed a very slow
efflux in absence of external substrate, according to its antiport
mode, the mutant unidirectional efflux was much faster with a
nearly complete proteoliposome emptying (Figure 6D). The
anomaly observed in the P375L mutant indicates that, in vivo,
loss of intracellular SLC7A5 substrate(s) impairs the driving force
for taking up SLC7A5 substrates.
To further validate the functional impact of SLC7A5 mutation in
the patient-specific genetic background, we obtained human
dermal fibroblasts from two affected and a few unaffected mem-
bers of Family 1426 and Family 1465 and performed [3H]-leucine
uptake assay (Sinclair et al., 2013). SLC7A5 transcript is ex-
pressed in human dermal fibroblasts and its level is not affected
by the missense mutations (Figure S7F). Cells carrying the ho-
mozygous A246V or P375L variant, however, show a significant
reduction in [3H]-leucine uptake when compared with control
cells (Figure 6E). Thus, the substitution of the SLC7A5 alanine
246 into a valine, or of the proline 375 into a leucine, is sufficient
to significantly reduce the SLC7A5-mediated BCAA uptake.
BCAA Intracerebroventricular Injections Rescue
Neurological Abnormalities in Adult Slc7a5 Mutant Mice
The identification of ASD patients carrying mutations in the
SLC7A5 gene prompted the question whether this condition is
potentially treatable. Therefore, we injected leucine and isoleu-
cine stereotaxically into the brain of adult Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl
mice for 3 weeks (Figure 7A). Injected mice were then tested
for some of the behavioral phenotypes described in Figure 3
and brain amino acid levels. Notably, after 3 weeks of i.c.v.
leucine and isoleucine delivery (Figure 7A), their brain level was
normalized (Figure 7B; Table S3), and the mutant mice showed
a significant improvement in neurobehavioral abnormalities.
Specifically, we observed a decreased number of Tie2Cre;
Slc7a5fl/fl mice showing the clasping (50% of injected versus
89% of non-injected mutant mice) and the kyphosis phenotype
(25% of injected versus 44% of non-injected mutant mice).
Most importantly, we could not detect any difference between
treated Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl and wild-type mice in the open field
test neither in velocity and distance moved nor in the number
of rearings (Figure 7C). The gait of the injected Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl
mice was improved with a complete normalization of the sway
length (Figure 7D). Importantly, wild-type animals injected with
the leucine/isoleucine mixture were indistinguishable from the
non-injected animals of the corresponding genotype (Figures
7C and 7D), indicating that leucine and isoleucine specifically
improve behavior of Slc7a5 mutants. Worth mentioning is the
fact that the rescue of the social and vocalization abnormalities
could not be tested given technical issues presented by the
presence of the implanted pump and the size of the animals
(see the STAR Methods).
Although further tests are required to determine the extent and
efficacy of the treatment, our data suggest that certain neurobe-
havioral abnormalities observed in Slc7a5 mutants can be
rescued by i.c.v. administration of leucine and isoleucine in adult-
hood. Even if we cannot entirely disregard a role of the increased
level of other amino acids, these results support the idea that the
reduction in brain leucine and isoleucine levels is the determinant
factor in the appearance of the neurological phenotypes
observed in humans and mice lacking SLC7A5 expression.
DISCUSSION
Although SLC7A5 has been described as a BBB amino acid
transporter, studies accurately verifying its expression or exam-
ining its function at the BBB are completely missing in the litera-
ture. Moreover, transport studies were performed using only
in vitro systems thus lacking the expression of other carriers
with possibly overlapping substrates and its physiological impor-
tance remained almost completely undetermined.
Our study shows that SLC7A5 loss of function leads to ASD
and motor dysfunctions in humans and mice. This fits with our
previous work in which we have shown that mutations implicated
in abnormal BCAA catabolism lead to ASD and fine motor coor-
dination problems (Novarino et al., 2012). Along the same line, an
increase in the brain levels of these same amino acids leads to
the maple syrup urine disorder, characterized by cognitive
dysfunctions, seizures, and hypotonia (Menkes et al., 1954; Zin-
nanti et al., 2009). Although we acknowledge that ASD due to
SLC7A5 mutations may be an extremely rare condition, the pre-
sent study indicates that fine-tuning of brain BCAA and LNAA
concentrations is key for normal brain function, and mutations
affecting genes contributing to BCAA homeostasis and the
downstream signaling cascade may underlie a larger subgroup
of ASD. In addition, this work has several important pathophys-
iological implications.
We show that Slc7a5 expression at the BBB is particularly
important to set a correct brain BCAA concentration. In fact, a
lack of Slc7a5 expression at the BBB leads to a significant reduc-
tion in brain BCAA levels, particularly leucine and isoleucine. Sur-
prisingly, we did not detect significant reductions in the brain
levels of the other LNAAs, which in the mutant mice are rather
slightly increased, indicating that additional carriers are involved
in their transport. Among the most altered amino acids, beside
leucine and isoleucine, we detected histidine, suggesting that
this amino acid may have a special role in the function of the trans-
porter.Noteworthy,thenormalbrainhistaminelevels(FigureS2C),
as well as the RNA-seq data obtained from mutant mice, exclude
an alteration of histaminergic transmission. Moreover, abnormally
high serum and cerebrospinal fluid histidine levels have been re-
ported in healthy individuals implying that increased histidine con-
centration is non-pathological (Lam et al., 1996).
Furthermore, we show that deletion of Slc7a5 from the
BBB leads to activation of the AAR pathway and reduced
(E) Radio-labeled leucine ([3H]Leu) transport analysis in human fibroblasts from affected (A) and unaffected (U) members of families 1426 and 1465 illustrating a
significant reduction in leucine uptake by the cells of affected patients. Specificity of leucine uptake was assessed by competition with 10 mM cold leucine (Leu) or
10 mM 2 BCH; ***p < 0.001 (means ± SEM; N R 3 experiments performed with fibroblasts from two patients and one healthy control/family).

 cap-dependent translation. How exactly abnormal regulation of
translation leads to the observed phenotypes in SLC7A5 mutant
humans and mice remains to be investigated. However, we
observed that inhibitory neurons may be more sensitive to altered
amino acid levels as Atf5, a key molecule in the AAR pathway, has
been reported to be preferentially expressed in GABA-synthetiz-
ing neurons (Zeisel et al., 2015). Accordingly, we found that
deletion of Slc7a5 from the BBB is sufficient to reduce cortical
inhibitory activity, resulting in cortical excitation and inhibition
imbalance and probably causing the observed neurological com-
plications. Similarly, most of the functionally characterized ASD-
mutations lead to an imbalance in the excitation/inhibition ratio.
Thus, drugs acting on GABA transmission are considered an op-
portunity for the treatment of ASD and epilepsy (Braat and Kooy,
2015). It is therefore tempting to reason that identifying the rules
by which simple molecule such as the BCAAs may regulate
GABAergic transmission might have a crucial impact on the
development of novel therapeutic strategies for ASD.

 Notably, besides representing a new subgroup of ASD, BCAA-
related ASD may also represent a group of treatable conditions.
Indeed, BCAA dietary administration in BCKDK null mice and hu-
mans (Novarino et al., 2012), as well as leucine and isoleucine
i.c.v. injection in adult Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice lead to a significant
improvement of the neurobehavioral abnormalities.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
Experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at IST
Austria. Generation of the Tie2-Cre and Slc7a5 floxed lines has been described previously (Kisanuki et al., 2001; Sinclair et al.,
2013). For all experiments we made use of littermates derived from crossing Cre negative Slc7a5fl/fl females with Cre positive
Slc7a5fl/+ males. Mice were backcrossed to the N10 generation in C57BL/6J mice. Overall, Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl transgenic animals
were viable and fertile. Mice were housed together with their littermates in groups of 3-4 animals per cage and kept on a regular
12 hr light/dark cycle (7:00-19:00 light period). Food and water were available ad libitum. Experiments were carried out under path-
ogen-free conditions and health status of the mouse line was routinely checked by a veterinary. Experiments were carried out with
randomly chosen littermates of the same sex. Both males and females were used with exception of the three-chamber test for which
only males were employed. The genotype, age and developmental stage of the employed animals are specified separately for each
experiment. For all the experiments the animals were drug and test naive but when possible mice were employed for different tests
starting with the less aversive test (see behavioral study description).
Human Subjects and Sample Collection
Patients were identified from a cohort of over 2500 families, with at least one member of the family displaying a childhood onset
neurological condition of likely genetic origin, from several world-wide recruitment efforts targeting patients with intellectual
disability, structural brain diseases or neurodevelopmental disorders. Recruitment was focused in the major population centers of

 the Middle East including Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Jordan, Pakistan, Turkey and Iran, with consan-
guinity rates (i.e., rate of marriage between first or second cousins) of approximately 50% compared with < 1% is US and Western
Europe. Among the recruited cohort, consanguinity was present in 63% of parents, suggesting some bias in sampling toward those
with affected children due to recessive disease. Sampling was performed on both parents and all available genetically informative
siblings to include affected and unaffected members, as well as extended family members if appropriate, consistent with IRB guide-
lines. All patients were evaluated directly by one of the co-authors with specialty training in neurology, child neurology and/or clinical
genetics, and in accordance with local medical practices. All patients/families enrolled in IRB approved protocols based at referral
institutions, and each family provided consent for study. Sequencing was performed on at least one but sometimes two affected or
the father-mother-affected trio per family. Families 1426 and 1465 were identified and employed in this study because of comprising
patients with homozygous disruptive mutations in the SLC7A5 gene. Diagnosis of autism was set prior to whole exome sequencing
and according to internationally accepted guidelines (DSM-V and CARS interview). Videos documenting the neurological examina-
tion and clinical features documentation were obtained in most of the cases.
Patient 1426-5 (female) was born at full term by normal delivery to a healthy mother after an uneventful pregnancy. There was no
history of intellectual disability or epilepsy in the family. No chromosomal abnormalities were identified. Occipito-frontal head circum-
ference (OFC) was �2 SD at birth and �5 SD in late childhood. The girl never learned to walk; she shows increased tone, clonus and
dystonia since 5 years of age. She can bear some weight on the legs with support. She shows impaired social interaction, eye-to-eye
gaze, and restrictive behaviors but has a social smile. She can understand simple commands but does not have speech. CARS (child-
hood autism rating scale) score at the age of 33 was 31 (autism cutoff 30). She has no seizures and she does not take any medication.
She has no other health problems. There are no progressive features.
Patient 1426-6 (male), 1426-8 (female), 1426-16 (male) and 1426-19 (male) presentation and history are essentially similar to patient
1426-5. In late childhood all the patients present with various degrees of microcephaly (see Figure 5B). CARS score for patients
1426-6 and 1426-8 were 31 and 34 at the age of 17 and 12 years, respectively. Patient 1426-16 died of an unrelated cause during
the preparation of this manuscript; therefore there is not updated information for this patient.
Importantly, all the affected individuals of family 1426 have normal plasma amino acid concentrations (Table S5).
Patient 1465-3 (male) was the second child, born to consanguineous parents (who were first cousins) at full term, after an unevent-
ful pregnancy. He presented with intractable epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay during his infancy period. The medical history of
the family is notable for a previous case of microcephaly. The patient began walking at 48 months. Upon examination, his weight,
height and head circumference measurements were under 3rd percent, he was hypotonic and microcephalic with slightly dysmor-
phic face. He was unable to speak. He had joint laxity in his lower extremities and pes planus in both feet.
Patient 1465-4 (male) has also been born at full term after a normal pregnancy, but displayed similar symptoms of abnormal devel-
opment. Like his brother, he was brought to medical attention due to intractable seizures, which started when he was six months old.
When he was 24-months-old he was able to sit without support. He never developed speech. At the time of examination, he was
found to have microcephaly, hypotonia, slightly dysmorphic face, scoliosis, decreased subcutaneous fatty tissue and joint laxity
in his hands and lower extremities. He was unable to speak or write, and was able to walk with support.
Cell Lines
Mutant and control fibroblasts were generated from explants of dermal biopsies following informed consent under protocols
approved by the University of California San Diego or Yale University. Primary skin fibroblasts from affected and unaffected pas-
sage-matched controls were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1X
Penicillin-Streptomycin. Cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37�C. Cell lines were routinely tested to exclude
Mycoplasma contaminations.
Protein Model
The SLC7A5 homology model was built based on the X-ray structure of the agmatine/arginine AdiC transporter from E. Coli in the
outward-occluded arginine-bound conformation (PDB identifier 3L1L) (Gao et al., 2010). SLC7A5 and AdiC are members of the amino
acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) transporter superfamily and exhibit sequence identity of about 22% (Geier et al., 2013; Saier
et al., 2009). We used PyMOL to visualize the model and predict possible mutation effect on the protein structure (DeLano, 2002).
METHOD DETAILS
Amino Acid Analysis
Plasma Amino Acid Analysis in Mice
Adult mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, decapitated and blood was collected (200 mL) from their trunks into commercially
available anticoagulant treated tubes (e.g., heparin tubes Vacuette, Greiner Bio One). Cells were removed from plasma by centrifu-
gation for 10 min at 2000 X g at 4�C. Following centrifugation the plasma supernatant was transferred into clean polypropylene tubes
and kept at �70�C until assayed for amino acid concentrations by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Mouse plasma
amino acid values reported in Table S1 represent mean ± SEM obtained from n = 4 mice per genotype.

 Plasma Amino Acid Analysis in Humans
Patient blood samples were collected under fasting conditions. Blood samples were collected on Guthrie cards and analyzed by LC-
MS/MS and flow injection analysis-tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) (Novarino et al., 2012). Plasma amino acid values re-
ported in Table S5 are the result of a single blood amino acid test. Similarly, previous investigation didn’t reveal serum amino acid
levels abnormalities.
Brain Amino Acid Analysis in Mice
Adult mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, decapitated and the left hemisphere of the brain was collected, weighed and
immediately homogenized in 1 mL of ice-cold radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4, 1% NP-
40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA – all from Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of cOmplete Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Complete, Roche). The tissue was disrupted using a glass homogenizer, transferred into a collecting tube, and left
on ice for 1 hr. The homogenate was centrifuged for 40 min at 100,000 X g at 4�C in a SW41Ti rotor in a Beckman Optima XPN-80
ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter), the supernatant was collected and deproteinized by the addition of an equal volume of a solution
of 8% (wt/vol) 5-sulfosalicylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at �70�C until assayed for amino acid concentrations. At the time of the
assay, the samples were thawed, mixed, centrifuged for 30 min at 5,000 X g at 4�C to remove the precipitated protein and assessed
by HPLC (performed at Archimedlife GmbH). Four to eight animals per genotype/per time point (E14.5, P2 and P40) were employed
for determination of brain amino acid levels. HPLC analysis was performed blinded to genotype. Brain amino acid samples were
tested in duplicate in 2 to 3 independent experiments except for the E14.5 for which all the samples were measured in duplicate
but collected and measured at the same day.
RNA-Sequencing
Adult mice were euthanized under anesthesia and the brains were quickly dissected on ice. The cerebellum was used for RNA extrac-
tion by using 700 mL Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for homogenization and 140 mL chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by centri-
fugation at 12000 g for 15 min at 4�C. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol were
added. Total RNA was extracted by using the RNA Clean&Concentrator-5 prep Kit (Zymo Research). RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Prom-
ega) treatment was also applied as described in the kit instructions manual. RNA sample quality was checked by using the NanoDrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Bioanalyzer 2100 with the RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent). Then 1.5 mg total RNA
was used to generate cDNA libraries by following the manufacturer’s instructions in the SENSE mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit V2
(Lexogen). Quality check of the generated libraries was assessed by using the Bioanalyzer 2100 with the High Sensitivity DNA
Analysis Kit (Agilent). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument.
Western Blot
Adult mice were euthanized under anesthesia, the brain was dissected and homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl,
pH = 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA – all from Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Complete, Roche) and/or with phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma Aldrich). After
1 hr of incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 4�C at 14.000 g for 15 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant
was measured using the BioRad protein assay method (BioRad). For the western blot, 30-50 mg proteins were mixed with Laemmli
buffer 6x (375 mM Tris pH = 6.8, 12%SDS, 60% glycerol, 600 mM DTT, 0.06% bromphenol blue – all fro Sigma-Aldrich), heated to
95�C and then separated on 6%–15% SDS-PAGE gels in running buffer (3.03 g Tris base, 14.1 g glycine, 1 g SDS –Sigma-Aldrich, 1 L
MilliQ water). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a transfer buffer (3.03 g Tris base, 14.1 g glycine, 1 L MilliQ
water) for 2 hr at 4�C in a Bio-Rad Micro Cell western blotting apparatus (300 mA constant intensity). The membranes were blocked
for 1 hr with 5% milk in 1x TBS with 1% Tween (TBST) and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4�C. After 4x10 min washes
with TBST, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase
coupled anti-igG antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate: Pierce ECL kit/Super Signal West
Pico kit/Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following primary antibodies
were used: rabbit anti-4E-BP1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 9644); rabbit anti-phospho-4E-BP1(1:1000, Cell Signaling, 2855); rabbit
anti-eIF4E (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 2067); rabbit anti-phospho-eIF4E (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 9741); rabbit anti-eIF2 alpha (1:1000,
Cell Signaling, 9722); rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2 alpha (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 3398); rabbit anti-S6K (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 2708);
rabbit anti-phspho-S6K (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 9234); rabbit anti-VGAT (1:200, Millipore, AB5062P); mouse anti-Tubulin beta 3
(1:1000, BioLegend, MMS-435P). Secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit HRP (1:1000, Thermo Scientific, A16035); goat anti-
mouse HRP (1:1000, Thermo Scientific, 31432). Each western blot was repeated at least in 2 independent experiments.
Polysome Profiling
Adult mice were euthanized by cortical dislocation, dissected and the brains were removed. Cortices were separated and lysed in
Lysis Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0,5 mM DTT, 100 mg/mL cycloheximide- Sigma-Aldrich, Roche Com-
plete Protease Inhibitors (EDTA-free), 40 U/mL RNAsin - Promega, 20 U/mL Superasin – Thermo Fischer Scientific) using a dounce.
Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 x g at 4�C and the resulting supernatants were supplemented with NP-40 and Triton
X-100 (both to 1%) and incubated on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 20000 x g at 4�C the debris-free supernatants
were flash-frozen and stored at �80�C until further use. Thawed supernatants were loaded onto 14 3 95 mm Polyclear centrifuge

 tubes (Seton) containing 17.5%–50% sucrose gradients (in Gradient Buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 100 mg/mL cycloheximide); the sucrose gradients were generated using the Gradient Master 108 programmable
gradient pourer (Biocomp) and were centrifuged for 2.5 hr at 35,000 rpm in a SW40Ti rotor in a Beckman L7 ultracentrifuge (Beckman
Coulter). After centrifugation gradients were fractionated and measured for RNA content using a Piston Gradient Fractionator (Bio-
comp) attached to a UV monitor (BioRad). Data represents mean ± SEM obtained from n = 9 KO and 10 WT mice from N = 2 inde-
pendent experiments.
Immunohistochemistry
Adult mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of Ketamin 100mg/kg, Xylazine 10mg/kg and Acepromazin 3mg/kg as
a mixture in one syringe. Unconscious state of the mouse was verified by pinching the hind limb (interdigital reflex). The diaphragm
was opened from the abdominal side to expose the heart. A small incision was made in the right atrium and a butterfly needle was
placed in the left ventricle to infuse phosphate buffered saline (PBS – Sigma-Aldrich) solution (25 mM Phosphate Buffer (PB), 0.9%
NaCl) at 7 ml/min for 2 min using a perfusion pump. Afterward the PBS was exchanged with a fixative solution consisting of 4% Para-
formaldehyde (PFA- Sigma-Aldrich) + 0.05% Glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in 0.1M PB (5-10 min). The brains were
removed and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4�C. Next, brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution at 4�C for one day
and embedded in Optimum Cutting Temperature (O.C.T., Tissue Tek) or removed from the sucrose and kept on dry ice and sliced.
Free-floating 20 mm sections were cut using either a Microm HM560 cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or a sliding VT 1200S vibra-
tome (Leica Microsystems). Cryostat sliced sections were used for stainings that required antigen retrieval (e.g., SLC7A5 staining)
whereas the vibratome sliced sections were used for non-antigen retrieval staining and were collected in PBS. Slices were washed
twice with PBS (10 min) at room temperature and then antigen retrieval was performed for 20 min at 98�C in Target Retrieval Solution
(Dako) pH = 6 in an electric pot. Samples were cooled to room temperature and then washed again twice with PBS (10 min). The
sections were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and then blocked for 40 min in 5% normal goat serum
(Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight with primary antibody
at 4�C. The sections were washed (3x10 min) with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 hr at
room temperature in a dark place. Sections were incubated with DAPI (10 min) and then washed (3x10 min) with 0.01% Triton
X-100 in PBS and mounted onto glass slides with Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescent signal was detected using a LSM 700 inverted
confocal microscope (Zeiss). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-SLC7A5 (1:200, received from Prof. Kanai
(Matsuo et al., 2000)); rat anti-MECA32 (1:600, Novus Biologicals, NB100-77668); rabbit anti-Parvalbumin (1:500, Abcam,
ab11427); rat anti-Ctip2 (1:400, Abcam, ab18465); rabbit anti-Cux1 (1:400, Santa Cruz, sc13024); rabbit anti-Somatostatin
(1:1000, Penlabs, T-4103); rabbit anti-Calretinin (1:4500, Swant, 7697); rabbit anti-VGAT (1:200, Millipore, AB5062P); rabbit anti-
Neuroligin 2 (1:500, Synaptic System, 129203). The secondary antibodies used were: donkey anti-rabbit (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 488,
Life Technologies, A-21206); goat anti-rat (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 647, Life Technologies, A-21247). Immunohistochemistry experiments
were repeated in at least 3 independent experiments.
Nissl Staining
Adult mice were anesthetized and perfused with PFA 4% as described in the immunohistochemistry section. The brains were
removed and post-fixed for 2 hr in 4% PFA at 4�C. Next, brains were transferred to 70% ethanol overnight at 4�C. The next day
the ethanol was replaced with fresh 70% ethanol for another hour at room temperature, followed by 90% ethanol for 3 hr at room
temperature and eventually 100% ethanol overnight at room temperature. On the following day brains were placed in a 1:1 mix of
100% ethanol: paraffin solution (ethanol is added from time to time to avoid complete evaporation) for 12 hr at 65�C and then moved
to paraffin overnight at 65�C in an incubator. After this step brains were left to solidify in paraffin blocks and then 10 mm sections were
cut on a HM 355S Microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Paraffin slices were cleared with warm Roti-Histol (Carl Roth) for 10 min and
passed through absolute ethanol to water (96%, 90%, 70%, 50%, 30%, water) each step for 5 min. Slices were then kept in 1%
Cresyl Violet acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution for 4 min, followed by destaining solution (100 mL ethanol with 2 mL
100% acetic acid) for 5-10 s, absolute ethanol for 30 s and final absolute ethanol for 1 min. At the end slices were cleared with
Roti-Histol (10 min) and mounted with DPX (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired using the BX53 upright light microscope with
an attached DP70 digital camera (Olympus) and processed with Photoshop CS5.1 (Adobe Systems). Nissl staining observation
was repeated with 3 mice per genotype at two different developmental stages.
Electrophysiology
Littermates of the same sex but different genotypes were randomly used to prepare brain slices. Acute sagittal slices (300 mm) were
prepared from the cortex and from the cerebellum of 19 to 22 days old mice (here referred as P21). Animals were anesthetized by an
i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamin (100 mg/kg), xylazin (10 mg/kg) and acepromazin (3 mg/kg), then transcardially perfused with ice-
cold carbogenated solution containing (mM): 64 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 120 sucrose, 7 MgCl2 and
0.5 CaCl2 (all from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated). After decapitation, brains were removed for sectioning in the same ice-
cold cutting solution using a VT 1200S vibratome (Leica Microsystems). Slices were recovered in room-temperature carbogenated
regular artificial cerebrospinal fluid (mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, 1 MgCl2 and 2 CaCl2
(�320 mOsm, 7.2–7.4 pH) for 30 min and transferred to a recording chamber (RC-41LP, Warner Instruments) for experiments

 typically between 1 and 7 hr after slicing. Slices were visualized under infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) using a BX-
51WI microscope (Olympus) with a QIClickTM charge-coupled device camera (Q Imaging Inc, Surrey). Cerebellar Purkinje cells and
cortical layer 2-3 pyramidal cells with a prominent apical dendrite were visually identified with a microscope equipped with IR-DIC
optics mainly by location, shape and Clampex online membrane test parameters.
Borosilicate glass recording microelectrodes (World Precision Instruments) were pulled on a P-1000 horizontal puller (Sutter Instru-
ments) and backfilled with an internal solution containing (mM): 115 cessium methanesulphonate, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10
Cs4BAPTA, 5 lidocaine N-ethyl chloride, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, and 0.2% biocytin. Internal pH was adjusted to �7.3 with CsOH and
osmolarity adjusted to �295 mOsm with sucrose. Typical internal resistance was around 1.7–3.5 MU. After seal rupture and internal
equilibrium (5 min to allow proper dialysis of Cs+ internally), cells were recorded with series-resistance values < 10 MU (recording
traces were excluded for data analysis if series resistance changed by > 25%). Slices were perfused with room temperature carbo-
genated regular aCSF at a rate of approximately 2 ml/min�1. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded at
a holding potential of –70 mV and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) at the reversal potential for mEPSC (+ 10 mV). All
voltage clamp traces were recorded in the presence of 1 mM tetrodotoxin (Bio Trend) with theoretical liquid junction potential not cor-
rected for. Signals were filtered at 0.1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz and data acquired using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier and a Digidata
1550A.
Electron Microscopy
21 days old mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of Ketamin 100mg/kg, Xylazine 10mg/kg and Acepromazin 3mg/kg as a mixture
in one syringe. Unconscious state of the mouse was verified by pinching the hind limb (interdigital reflex). The diaphragm was opened
from the abdominal side to expose the heart. A small incision was made in the right atrium and a butterfly needle was placed in the left
ventricle to infuse PBS at 7 ml/min for 2 min using a perfusion pump. Afterward the PBS was exchanged with a fixative solution con-
taining 4% PFA + 5% Glutaraldehyde in 0.1M PB (5-10 min). The brains were removed and post-fixed overnight in a 0.4% PFA in 0.1M
PB at 4�C. 70 mm sections were cut using a Vibroslicer (Leica Microsystems), collected in PB and stored in PB+0.02% NaN3. Sections
were washed in PB and osmified with 2% osmium (Agar Scientific Ltd) in 0.1M PB for 45 min at room temperature. They were then
washed in 0.1M PB (10 min) and distilled water (3x10 min), and contrasted with 0.1% uranylacetate (Agar Scientific) in 50% ethanol
solution for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Samples were washed in distilled water (3x10 min) and dehydrated in ascending
ethanol solutions (50%, 70%, 90%, 96% and 100% for 10 min each), infiltrated in propylene oxide (2x10 min) and embedded in Dur-
cupan ACM (Sigma-Aldrich): propylene oxide mix 1/2 for 1h at room temperature, 2/1 for 1h at room temperature and mere Durcupan
overnight at room temperature. Samples were mounted on siliconized coverslips, placed on a heating plate for 30 min at 37�C and put
in an oven for 2 days at 60�C to polymerize resin. The region of interest (layer 2/3 somatosensory cortex) was cut and re-embedded in
a resin block for further slicing. 70 nm ultrathin serial sections were cut using an UC7 ultramicrotom (Leica Microsytems), collected on
formvar-coated copper-slot grids and examined in FE-SEM. Merlin VP Compact with STEM detector (Zeiss).
Behavioral Studies
All behavioral studies were carried out during the light period. Mice were habituated to the test room for at least 1 hr before each test.
In order to recover, mice were given one day between tests. All behavior apparatuses were cleaned between each trial with 70%
ethanol. All behavioral tests were performed starting with the least aversive task first and ending with the most aversive. Behavioral
tests were performed with P55 to P65 mice except for the juvenile social interaction test for which P25 to P35 animals were employed
and the ultrasonic vocalization test for which P2 to P10 pups were used. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
Open Field Test
Exploratory behavior in a novel environment was assessed by a 20 min session in an open field chamber (45cmL x 45cmW x30cmH)
made out of gray Plexiglas. The animal was placed in the center of the arena and then recording was started. Locomotor activity (dis-
tance traveled and velocity) in the center/periphery of the arena as well as rearing were recorded by using a video camera and
analyzed using the EthoVision XT 11.5 software (Noldus).
Three Chamber Test
Mice were tested for sociability as described previously (Moy et al., 2007). Specifically, the testing apparatus was a rectangular clear
Plexiglas three chambers box (60cm (L) x 40cm (W) x 20 cm (H)). The dividing walls had doorways allowing access to each chamber.
Age and sex matched animals were used for all tests. C57BL/6J mice were used as stranger mice and were habituated to placement
inside the wire cage. Each test animal was first placed into the center chamber with open access to both left and right chamber, each
chamber containing an empty round wire cage. The wire cage (12cmH, 11cm diameter) allows nose contact between mice but pre-
vents fighting. After 10 min of habituation, during the social phase, an age-matched stranger was placed in the left chamber while a
novel object was placed into the right chamber. The test animal was allowed to freely explore the social apparatus for 10 min and
show whether it prefers to interact with the novel object or with the stranger mouse. At the end of the first 10 min, each mouse
was tested in a second 10 min session to evaluate the preference for a novel stranger, which was placed inside the right wire
cage. Number of nose contacts (< 5cm proximity) with the caged mouse was calculated.
Juvenile Social Interaction
Juvenile social interactions were assessed in 25-35 days old mice in the Noldus PhenoTyper 3000 Observer chamber (30cm (L) x
30cm (W) x 35 cm (H)) as previously described (Silverman et al., 2011). Prior to the interaction session mice were individually housed
e6
Cell 167, 1481–1494.e1–e11, December 1, 2016
 for 1 hr. Two animals were placed simultaneously in the chamber and then recording started. Three types of interactions were as-
sessed: wild-type/knockout; wild-type/wild-type and knockout/knockout, between age and sex matched subjects. Interactions
were tracked for 10 min using a digital camera incorporated in the PhenoTyper chamber. Ineractions were scored using the
EthoVision XT 11.5 software (Noldus) and included number of nose-nose sniffing and distance between subjects.
Walking Beam Test
Fine motor coordination and balance was assessed by the beam walking assay (Carter et al., 2001). This test essentially examines the
ability of the animals to remain upright and to walk on an elevated and relatively narrow beam. The beam apparatus consists of
several 1 m-long beams with diameters of 5 cm, 3 cm and 1 cm, resting 50 cm above the floor on two poles. During the test a mouse
is placed on one extremity of the beam and a black box was placed at the end of the beam as finish point. The test took place over 3
consecutive days, 2 days training and 1 day testing (3 trials per day). In between trials mice were allowed to rest in their cages for
10 min. On the training days mice were allowed to cross the 5 and 3 cm beams while on the test day mice walked on the 1 cm
beam. A nylon hammock was stretched below the beam to cushion any falls. A video camera was set on a tripod to record the per-
formance. Performance on the beam was quantified by measuring the latency to cross the beam.
Isolation-Induced Ultrasonic Vocalizations (USVs) in Mouse Pups
Whistle like sounds (between 30-90 kHz) were recorded from newborn pups as previously described (Scattoni et al., 2009). A micro-
phone (part of the Noldus UltraVox XT system) was placed inside a dark, soundproof polycarbonate box (37cm (L) x 37cm (W) x 57cm
(H)). Neonatal pups (postnatal days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) were separated from their mother and placed inside the recording chamber. USVs
were recorded for 3 min and afterward the pup was placed back with its mother until weaning time.
Gait Measurement Test
Gait was analyzed by performing the footprint test as previously described (Carter et al., 2001). Specifically, the fore and hind paws
were painted with nontoxic dyes of different colors and then the mouse was allowed to walk in a straight line (in a narrow corridor
using as bait a cage at the end of the walkway) over absorbent paper. The footprint patterns were then analyzed for stride length,
sway length and stance length.
Marble Burying Test
Stereotyped behavior was assessed by placing adult mice (60 days old) into an usual animal cage (30cm (L) x 20cm (W) x 20cm (H),
Tecniplast) filled with 5cm deep chip bedding, as previously described (Deacon, 2006). Bedding was reused between sex matched
animals. A regular pattern of glass marbles (5 rows of 4 marbles) was placed on the bedding and the subject was allowed to explore
for 25 min. The number of buried (to 2/3 of their depth in bedding) marbles was counted.
Hind Limb Clasping Test
As previously described (Guyenet et al., 2010), mice were grasped by their tail and suspended. Hind limb position was observed for
10 s. If the hind limbs were retracted toward the abdomen then the mouse was marked as positive for clasping. The test was repeated
three times. At the end of the test the mouse was placed back into its cage. The test was repeated three times for each animal.
Kyphosis Test
Kyphosis is a characteristic curvature of the spine that is common in mouse models of certain neurological disorders (Guyenet et al.,
2010). The mouse was removed form its cage and placed on a flat surface. While it was walking, we observed whether it was able to
easily straighten its spine completely. If it was not the case, the mouse was marked as positive for kyphosis. At the end of the test the
mouse was placed back into its cage. The test was repeated three times for each animal.
Intracerebroventricular Dye Injection
40 days old mice were injected s.c. with meloxicam 5 mg/kg one hour prior surgery in order to achieve analgesia and then
anesthetized initially with isoflurane 4% and O2 0.5-1L/min in a gas chamber. Once anesthetized (checked by toe pinching), the
mouse was placed in a Kopf stereotaxic frame and a nose cone was placed over the nose with isoflurane volume turned down to
2% to maintain the anesthesia. After sterilizing the surgical site with betadine, a midline incision was made over the skull and a small
hole was drilled above the left lateral ventricle. Using a Hamilton syringe, connected to the Kopf stereotactic frame, 10 mL of dye was
delivered into the ventricle in order to check later on the injection site accuracy. The coordinates used relative to bregma were:
anterioposterior (AP) = �0.5 mm, medial lateral (ML) = �1.1 mm, dorsal ventral (DV) = �3 mm. To allow diffusion of the dye into
the brain, the needle was left for 5 min at the site of injection. The incision was manually closed using a topical tissue adhesive
(GLUture, World Precision Instruments). Two hours later the mouse was euthanized and the brain was kept overnight in 4% PFA.
The next day the brain was embedded in 3% agarose blocks and then sliced (100 mm) using a VT 1200S vibratome (Leica Microsys-
tems) in order to assess the diffusion of the dye in the entire ventricular system and to confirm the correct positioning of the needle in
the left ventricle.
Serial Surgical Implantation of Cannula and Osmotic Pumps
One day before the surgery, a micro-osmotic pump (ALZET model 1007D) was filled with 100 mL of a saline amino acid solution
(isoleucine 100 mM, leucine 100 mM). The pump was then connected through a plastic catheter to a cannula with a 0.5 mm spacer
attached to it (ALZET Brain Infusion Kit 3). The pump was designed to deliver the solution at a rate of 0.5 mL/hour for 7 days. The pump
and cannula assembly was kept in saline overnight at 37�C. Adult mice were injected s.c. with meloxicam 5 mg/kg one hour prior
surgery in order to achieve analgesia and then anesthetized initially with isoflurane 4% and O2 0.5-1L/min in a gas chamber.
Cell 167, 1481–1494.e1–e11, December 1, 2016
e7
 Once anesthetized (checked by toe pinching), the mouse was placed in a Kopf stereotaxic frame and a nose cone was placed over
the nose with isoflurane volume turned down to 2% to maintain the anesthesia. Eyes were covered with ointment in order to prevent
drying out. During surgery metamizol 200mg/kg was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to ensure maintenance of analgesia. After
sterilizing the surgical site with betadine, a midline incision was made over the skull and a subcutaneous pocket was created on the
back of the animal. The pump was then inserted inside the pocket and a small hole was drilled above the left lateral ventricle following
the coordinates identified during the calibration study performed with dye injections and as previously described (DeVos and Miller,
2013), AP = �0.5 mm, ML = �1.1 mm, DV = �2.5mm. The incision was manually closed using a topical tissue adhesive (GLUture,
World Precision Instruments). The incision site was sterilized with betadine and an ointment was applied to keep the spot moisturized.
One week later the pump was replaced with a 200 mL micro-osmotic pump (ALZET model 2002) filled with the same amino acid
solution as mentioned above. The replacement procedure was done following the same steps as described for the 100 mL pump.
The mice were singly caged until the time for behavioral testing (e.g., walking beam test, gait measurement, open field test). Behav-
ioral tests were performed with P55 to P65 mice. At the end of the three-week administration, mice were euthanized and their brains
were dissected for HPLC protein analysis. Data represent means ± SEM; n = 10 (untreated) control, n = 4 (treated) control, n = 11
(untreated) mutant and n = 8 (treated) mutant mice.
Whole Exome Sequencing, Homozygosity Profile, and Variant Prioritization
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using salt extraction. For family 1426 blocks of homozygosity were determined
by HomozygosityMapper. Whole-Exome Sequencing and variant analysis was performed using solution hybrid SureSelect reagents
(Agilent, Mountain View, CA) and sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000 instrument (Gnirke et al., 2009). The sequence reads
were aligned to the human genome (hg19), genetic variants were delineated using the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK 1.1) software
and SAMTools (v1.4-r985) algorithms, for both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Indels.
Variants were prioritized using the following criteria:
1. The variant was predicted to perturb protein function. All synonymous and intronic variants were excluded unless the variant
was within a predicted splice site (+ or �2 bp from splice junction). Any variation that was predicted to alter gene expression or
protein function was included. These included nonsynonymous variations in coding regions (i.e., missense) or alterations re-
sulting in frameshifts, premature stop codons, loss of stop codons, coding INDELS, and splice sites (i.e., ± 2 nucleotides from
an exon junction).
2. The variant was rare as defined by allele frequency of less than 0.2%. Allele frequencies were determined by an in-house data-
base of over 1500 Middle Eastern exomes, and public databases provided by The Exome Variant Server from NHLBI GO
Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and dbSNP135.
3. The variant was present in a region of homozygosity as defined by HomozygosityMapper.
4. The variant was highly conserved throughout evolution as determined by a number of conservation scores including GERP,
PhastCons, and PolyPhen2. Variations with negative GERP scores or vertebrate PhastCons scores less than 0.8 were
excluded. Typical conservation criteria for the candidate genes provided in this study were GERP > 4 and vertebrate
PhastCons > 0.9.
5. The variant segregated with the disease in the family pedigree. All variants following the above criteria were considered for
each family independent of its predicted severity (i.e., no variants were excluded based upon type of mutation).
The remaining variants were ranked by type of mutation (indels > nonsense > missense), amino acid conservation across species
and protein damage prediction based upon location of the mutation in a specialized protein domain. The variants were annotated for
novelty and compared with dbSNP (build 132) and control samples analyzed by whole-exome sequencing experiments performed by
our human genomics groups. Variants were analyzed against the RefSeq gene definitions, a list that includes 18,933 specific genes.
Where multiple isoforms gave varying results the one most likely to lead to protein disruption was chosen.
Sanger Sequencing
Primers were designed using the Primer3 program and tested for specificity using ENSEMBL’s BLAST software. PCR products were
treated using Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Affymetrix) and sequenced using the Big
Dye terminator cycle sequencing Kit v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3100 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sequence
data were analyzed using Sequencher 4.9 (Gene Codes).
Leucine Uptake Assay
Leucine uptake was performed as previously described (Sinclair et al., 2013). Briefly, 300.000 cells were plated in a single well of 6
well plates two days before the assay. The day of the experiment the cells were washed twice with HBSS and incubated in HBSS
containing [3H] leucine (Perkin Elmer) 0.5 uCi/ml alone or in the presence of 10 mM leucine or 3 mM BCH (Wang et al., 2011). Cells
were incubated at 37�C for 1 hr. At the end of the incubation each well was washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 1 mM NaOH

 Cloning, Mutagenesis, and Expression of the Human SLC7A5 Wild-Type and Mutants
The construct pH6EX3-wt SLC7A5 obtained as previously described (Galluccio et al., 2013) and containing the SLC7A5 cDNA was
used for site-directed mutagenesis. Specific mutants of the SLC7A5 cDNA were obtained by PCR overlap extension methods, as
previously done for other proteins (Galluccio et al., 2015), using the primers in Table S4.
To supply tRNA for rare codons, Rosetta(DE3)pLysS E. coli strain was transformed either with SLC7A5 wild-type or mutant proteins
(Galluccio et al., 2013) and selected on agar plates supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. A colony was picked and
cultured overnight at 37�C under rotary shaking (about 200 rpm) in selective LB broth and the day after was diluted 1:10 in same me-
dium. When the culture reached the mid logarithmic phase of growth, 0.4 mM IPTG was added and temperature was lowered at 28�C
for 4 hr as previously described (Galluccio et al., 2013).
Purification of Human SLC7A5 Wild-Type and Mutants
Pellets from induced cell lysates were used for protein purification as previously described (Napolitano et al., 2015). In brief, after
washing (0.1 M Tris HCl pH 8.0), pellets were solubilized using a 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 buffer containing 10 mM DTE, 0.8% sarkosyl,
3.5 M urea, 10% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl. Solubilized cell lysates were centrifuged (12,000 g, 10 min, 4�C) and the supernatants were
applied on a His Trap HP column (5 mL Ni Sepharose), connected to fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) A
¨ KTA start and equil-
ibrated with 10 mL buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% sarkosyl, and DTE 2 mM). During purification
procedure, column was washed with 10 mL of washing buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 10% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% n-Dodecyl
b-D-maltoside and 3 mM DTE – all from Sigma-Aldrich). Then, proteins were eluted by an isocratic step of 400 mM imidazole in the
above described buffer. Fractions 6-8 (2.5 mL) were pooled and desalted on a PD-10 column using a desalting buffer (20 mM Tris HCl
pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.05% n-Dodecyl b-D-maltoside and 10 mM DTE).
Reconstitution of Human SLC7A5 Wild-Type and Mutants in Proteoliposomes
The purified SLC7A5 wild-type and mutants were reconstituted by removing the detergent using the batch-wise method as previ-
ously described (Napolitano et al., 2015). In brief, 4 mg of protein (in 200 mL) were mixed to 100 mL of 10% C12E8, 100 mL of 10%
egg yolk phospholipids (w/v) in the form of sonicated liposomes prepared as previously described (Scalise et al., 2014), 20 mM
Tris HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM DTE, 100 mM K-gluconate and 10 mM l-His, except where differently indicated, in a final volume of
700 mL. The mixture was incubated with 0.5 g Amberlite XAD-4 resin under rotatory stirring (1200 rev/min) at room temperature
(25�C) for 90 min (Napolitano et al., 2015).
Transport Measurements
After reconstitution uptake and efflux experiments were conducted at 25�C. For uptake experiments, 600 mL of proteoliposomes
were passed through a Sephadex G-75 column (0.7 cm diameter 3 15 cm height) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5
and sucrose at appropriate concentrations to balance the internal osmolarity. Transport was started by adding 5 mM [3H]His to
the proteoliposomes. For efflux experiments, proteoliposomes containing 2 mM His, were preloaded with 5 mM [3H]His at high spe-
cific radioactivity (1 mCi/ml) for 30 min by transporter-mediated exchange equilibration. Proteoliposomes were then passed through
Sephadex G-75, as above described, to remove external compounds. Efflux was started by adding, or not, 1 mM of unradiolabelled
His. In both uptake and efflux assays, transport was stopped by adding a mix of 10 mM 2-amino-2-norbornanecarboxylic acid (BCH)
and 1 mM HgCl2 at the desired time interval. In control samples, the inhibitor was added at time zero. At the end of the transport assay,
each sample of proteoliposomes (100 mL) was passed through a Sephadex G-75 column (0.6 cm diameter 3 8 cm height) to separate
the external from the internal radioactivity. Proteoliposomes were eluted with 1 mL 50 mM NaCl and collected in 4 mL of scintillation
mixture, vortexed and counted. The experimental values were corrected by subtracting each sample inhibited at time zero. For ki-
netic measurements, the initial rate of transport was measured by stopping the reaction after 10 min, i.e., within the initial linear range
of [3H]His uptake.
Ultracentrifugation of Proteoliposomes
SLC7A5 WT and SLC7A5-A246V reconstituted proteoliposomes were passed through Sephadex G-75 column and 500 ml were ultra-
centrifuged (110,000 g, 1 hr 30 min, 4�C). Pellets were washed with 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 and ultracentrifuged again. Pellets were
solubilized with 3% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE 12% run and western blot analysis. SLC7A5 WT and mutants were immuno-
detected using anti-SLC7A5 antibody 1:2000, upon overnight incubation at 4�C. The reaction was detected by Electro Chemi Lumi-
nescence (ECL) assay after incubation with secondary antibody anti-rabbit 1:5000.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical values including the exact n, statistical significance, definition of center, and dispersion and precision measures are re-
ported in the Figure Legends. Student’s t test was mostly used and one-way ANOVA was used where appropriate (i.e., multiple com-
parisons). Data are shown as means ± SEM and were judged to be statistically significant when p < 0.05. In each graph circles/dots
represent individual values. All datasets were analyzed using Shapiro–Wilk test for normality.

 Amino Acid Data
Amino acid levels were normalized on the initial protein concentration and are displayed as fold change (log2 transformed) to levels in
controls. Data analysis was done in GraphPad Prism 7 and Student’s t test was used to test for significance. Mouse plasma amino
acid values reported in Table S1 represent mean ± SEM obtained from n = 4 mice per genotype. Brain amino acid values represent
mean ± SEM obtained from 4 to 8 mice per genotype per time point from at least 2 independent experiments.
RNA-Sequencing
Demultiplexed raw reads were trimmed before alignment as suggested by the library preparation kit, i.e., the first 9 bases of each read
were removed using the FASTX toolkit. Trimmed reads were aligned to the mouse genome using STAR version 2.5.4 (genome:
GrCm38, gene annotation: Gencode release M8). Reads that didn’t align uniquely were discarded. Read counts per gene were
also calculated using STAR (option -quantMode GeneCounts). Differential expression analysis was performed in R 3.2.4 employing
the Bioconductor package DESeq2 version 1.10.1 using an FDR threshold of 0.05, a local fit for the dispersion estimation and default
parameters otherwise. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was done using the Bioconductor package GOstats version 2.36.0 with a
p value cutoff of 0.001 and conditional testing enabled. GO enrichment results were visualized using a custom script. RNA
sequencing was performed employing n = 3 mice per genotype.
Protein Data
Western Blot
Western blot images were acquired by Peqlab Fusion SL Advance Multi Imaging system (VWR) and quantified using ImageJ soft-
ware. Protein levels are displayed as fold change. Student’s t test was used to test for significance (GraphPad Prism 7). Data repre-
sent mean ± SEM obtained from two to five mice per genotype typically from at least 2 independent experiments.
Polysome Profiling
Analysis was performed blinded to genotype. For quantitative analysis of individual elements (e.g., 80S monosomes, polysomes, etc)
from the polysome profiles, all traces were first exported to Microsoft Excel and adjusted as necessary to ensure matching x/y axis
scales. Traces were then exported to Photoshop CS5.1 and ImageJ for processing, baseline setting, cropping and pixel counting.
The pixel counts were used for determining polysome/monosome values and for plot generation. Student’s t test was used for the
statistical analysis (GraphPad Prism 7). Data represents mean ± SEM obtained from n = 9 KO and 10 WT mice from two independent
experiments. All datasets were analyzed using Shapiro–Wilk test for normality.
Immunohistochemistry
Fluorescent signal was detected using a LSM 700 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss) and images were processed with Photoshop
CS5.1 (Adobe Systems). Control and mutant samples were always treated equally and in parallel (e.g., if brightness or contrast were
adjusted identical changes were applied for all the samples). For each antibody, immunostainings were repeated in multiple animals
(typically 3 per genotype) obtaining comparable results. We counted all parvalbumin, somatostatin and calretinin interneurons as well
as VGAT and NLGN2 puncta intensity on coronal sections at different positions. Neurons/puncta quantified in a given animal were
added together. Means and SEM were calculated across animals, and Student’s t test was done across animals (n = 3 animals per
genotype).
Neuronal Data
Analysis was performed blinded to genotype using pCLAMP 10.4 software (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices). Statistical ana-
lyses were performed using Origin Software (Origin Inc), Clampfit and R. All datasets were analyzed using Shapiro–Wilk test for
normality. Datasets with normal distributions were analyzed for significance using one-way ANOVA measures with Bonferroni
post hoc test, using *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005. Datasets with non-normal distributions were analyzed using the 2-tailed Mann-Whitney
U test using *p < 0.05. Exact P values are presented in each figure. Cumulative distributions were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test. Data represent means ± SEM, ncells/nanimals/genotype: 14/7/Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/+ and 13/5/Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl (mEPSC);
16/7/Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/+ and 18/5/Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl (mIPSC).
Electron Microscopy
Analysis was performed blinded to the genotype. ATLAS 5 array tomography (Zeiss) was used for image acquisition and 3D recon-
struction of sample data. ImageJ software was used for quantification of the symmetric synapse vesicular pool and measurement of
the presynaptic terminal area. All datasets were analyzed using Shapiro–Wilk test for normality and met the criteria for normality.
GraphPad Prism 7 was used for statistical analysis applying Student’s t test. Data represent means ± SEM; nsynapses/genotype:
27/control and 22/mutant.
Behavior
Quantification of the different behavioral parameters was done using the EthoVison XT 11.5 (Noldus) and UltraVox XT software
(Noldus). Data met the criteria for normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test), thus Student’s t test was used for statistical analysis for
most of the behavioral data. For the three chamber test one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s post hoc test was applied and for the juvenile
social interaction test one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used (GraphPad Prism 7). Number of animals employed
e10
Cell 167, 1481–1494.e1–e11, December 1, 2016
 for each test is reported in the figure legend describing each experiments and range from n = 6 to n = 13 animal per genotype. At least
two independent cohorts were examined for each test.
Transport Measurement Data
For the efflux experiments, the [3H]His efflux was calculated by subtracting radioactivity values at each time point from that present in
the proteoliposomes at time zero.
Uptake data were fitted in a first-order rate equation to obtain rate constants and in Michaelis–Menten or Linewever-Burk equa-
tions. Efflux data were fitted in a single exponential decay equation. The Grafit software (version 5.0.13) was used for data fitting. To
measure the specific activity of SLC7A5 WT and mutants, protein quantity was estimated from Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE
gels by using the Chemidoc imaging system equipped with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) as previously described (Galluccio et al.,
2012). Data represent mean ± SD obtained from n = 4 to 5 independent experiments.
For the fibroblast leucine uptake assay the results of were obtained from at least 3 independent experiments (5 for family 1426 and
3 for family 1465) each one employing fibroblasts from at least 1 unaffected and 1 affected individual of the same family. For family
1426, given the very invasive procedure, we obtained skin biopsies only from 2 affected (patient 1426-6 and 1426-19) and 2 unaf-
fected individuals (1426-1 and 1426-2). The graph in Figure 6E represents the average of the transport values obtained for either
both the affected or the unaffected subjects in all the performed experiments. As deducible from the small error bar we didn’t notice
strong variability among individuals of the same family.

(A) Western blot analysis of the indicated SLC7A5 mutants in comparison with the WT protein reconstituted in proteoliposomes (top and middle panels). To
evaluate the efficiency of reconstituted SLC7A5, proteoliposomes reconstituted with WT or SLC7A5 A246V were separated from liposomes (not containing
