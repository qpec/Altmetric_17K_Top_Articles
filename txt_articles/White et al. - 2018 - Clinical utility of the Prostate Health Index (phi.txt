Abstract
Background Deciding when to biopsy a man with non-suspicious DRE findings and tPSA in the 4–10 ng/ml range can be
challenging, because two-thirds of such biopsies are typically found to be benign. The Prostate Health Index (phi) exhibits
significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer detection when compared to tPSA and %fPSA, however only
one published study to date has investigated its impact on biopsy decisions in clinical practice.
Methods An IRB approved observational study was conducted at four large urology group practices using a physician
reported two-part questionnaire. Physician recommendations were recorded before and after receiving the phi test result. A
historical control group was queried from each site's electronic medical records for eligible men who were seen by the same
participating urologists prior to the implementation of the phi test in their practice. 506 men receiving a phi test were
prospectively enrolled and 683 men were identified for the historical control group (without phi). Biopsy and pathological
findings were also recorded for both groups.
Results Men receiving a phi test showed a significant reduction in biopsy procedures performed when compared to the
historical control group (36.4% vs. 60.3%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Based on questionnaire responses, the phi score impacted
the physician’s patient management plan in 73% of cases, including biopsy deferrals when the phi score was low, and decisions
to perform biopsies when the phi score indicated an intermediate or high probability of prostate cancer (phi ≥36).
Conclusions phi testing significantly impacted the physician’s biopsy decision for men with tPSA in the 4–10 ng/ml range
and non-suspicious DRE findings. Appropriate utilization of phi resulted in a significant reduction in biopsy procedures
performed compared to historical patients seen by the same participating urologists who would have met enrollment
eligibility but did not receive a phi test.
Introduction
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer
(PCa) has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years.
Despite a documented reduction in men presenting with
metastatic disease since PSA was first introduced in the early
1990s [1, 2], its debatable impact on overall survival and an
increasing concern about over-diagnosis of indolent cancer
has led to restricted recommendations regarding its use [3–5].
The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recom-
mended against PSA screening for men of any age in 2012
[6], although an updated draft recommendation statement was
recently issued for public comment, wherein the USPSTF
acknowledged that PSA testing may be appropriate for
certain men in the 55–69 year age range (C-recommendation)
[7].

 Another problem associated with PSA testing is its
relatively poor diagnostic specificity. According to the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), ~85%
of men with PSA levels <4 ng/ml are found to have non-
cancerous biopsy findings, whereas men with PSA levels
between 4–10 ng/ml have ~30–35% chance of a positive
biopsy result [8]. This potentially exposes over two-thirds
of such men to complications associated with prostate
biopsies such as bleeding, pain, and the risk of infection.
Given these limitations, there is considerable interest in new
biomarker panels demonstrating improved clinical specifi-
city for PCa detection.
The Beckman Coulter Prostate Health Index (phi) com-
bines the results of three quantitative kallikrein immu-
noassays, total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), and [-2]
proPSA (p2PSA) into a single numerical score (the phi
score): (p2PSA/fPSA × √tPSA). It was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 for use as an
aid in distinguishing PCa from other benign prostatic con-
ditions in men aged 50 years having non-suspicious digital
rectal exam (DRE) findings and with serum tPSA levels
ranging from 4 to 10 ng/ml [9]. The pivotal clinical trial
submitted for FDA approval included 658 men who met the
above criteria and ranged in age from 50 to 84 years. The
phi test showed a significant improvement in PCa detection
when compared with tPSA and %fPSA. For example, a phi
score of 27.0 provided 31.1% clinical specificity at a sen-
sitivity cutoff of 90%. This represented nearly a 3-fold
improvement in PCa detection compared with tPSA testing
alone.
An expanded version of the multicenter study described
above was published, including 892 men with serum tPSA
levels ranging from 2 to 10 ng/ml [10]. An increasing phi
score was associated with a 4.7-fold increased risk of
prostate cancer and a 1.61-fold increased risk of aggressive
cancer (Gleason score ≥7) on biopsy. Additionally, the
improved diagnostic performance of phi has been demon-
strated in numerous other published clinical studies world-
wide [11–26]. A meta-analysis from eight such studies [27],
representing 2919 patients in total, showed a pooled clinical
specificity of 31.6% at the 90% sensitivity threshold (95%
Cl, 29.2%–34.0%).
Despite the proven diagnostic performance of phi, only
one published study to date has evaluated its clinical utility
in real world practice [28]. The purpose of the current study
was to prospectively examine the impact of phi testing on
biopsy decisions in four large urology group practices. The
primary objective was to examine how phi influenced the
physician’s management plan using a two-part ques-
tionnaire. The secondary objective was to compare biopsy

 procedures performed for patients receiving a phi test to
historical controls seen by the same participating physicians
before the phi test had been implemented in their practice.
Materials and Methods
Sites were selected based on the commercial implementation
of phi into their practice. Four large urology group practices
agreed to participate in the study, representing geographically
diverse regions across the United States. The protocol was
approved by a central institutional review board (IRB) with
waived consent because all patient information was de-
identified. Men receiving a phi test result were prospectively
enrolled from July 2015 through April 2017. Historical
control patients were identified from each site within
24 months prior to initiating the study protocol.
Study design
This was a prospective, observational study to determine if
the use of phi testing changes physician behavior patterns
when comparing their biopsy recommendations to a his-
torical control group of similar patients seen by the same
physicians (Fig. 1). A two-part questionnaire was used to
document the physician’s preliminary patient management
plan before receiving the phi result, compared to their final
recommendation for that same patient after receiving the phi
result (Fig. 2). Questions included whether or not knowl-
edge of the phi result was helpful when communicating
their final recommendation to patients. Clinical and patho-
logical data for both patient groups was extracted from on-
site electronic medical records.
Subjects
Patients for whom a participating urologist requested a phi
test were recruited at the time of blood draw for the pro-
spective (observational) study group. Inclusion criteria: men
≥50 years of age with total serum PSA between 4–10 ng/ml
and non-suspicious DRE findings. The prior PSA test was
required to be performed within 6 months of the DRE.
Exclusion criteria: men with a prior history of PCa, use of
any dosage of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors within the pre-
vious 3 months, men with a previous biopsy result that was
either positive or suspicious for prostate cancer (e.g.,
HGPIN, atypia), men with a history of prostatectomy for
any reason, or men who had undergone transurethral

 resection of the prostate. Patients were also excluded if the
physician decided not to wait for the phi result before
performing a biopsy.
The historical cohort of patients was selected from each
site’s electronic medical records for the purpose of establish-
ing a baseline of practice patterns within the 24 months prior
to their initiating the study protocol. Patients included in this
group met the inclusion/exclusion criteria but did not receive a
phi test as part of their assessment. For inclusion in the his-
torical control group, patients had to be treated by the same
physicians participating in the prospective arm of the study.
Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint of phi impact on decision to biopsy
was assessed for statistical significance using the Normal
Approximation to the binomial test for proportions. Per-
centages for categorical responses from the two-part ques-
tionnaire were calculated from Total N or available data
(where applicable). All data reporting and analyses were
done using SAS Software version 9.4M3. All statistical
tests were conducted with ɑ = 0.05, unless otherwise stated.
Results
Our study comprised a total of 506 men in the prospective
arm and 683 men in the historical control arm (Table 1).
Patient age distributions, demographics, and clinical risk
factors were balanced between the two arms.

 groups. 36.4% of men in the prospective group received a
biopsy (95% CI, 32.5%–40.9%), compared to the non-phi
tested historical control group’s biopsy rate of 60.3% (95%
CI, 56.3%–63.9%). This demonstrated a statistically sig-
nificant reduction (P < 0.0001) in biopsy procedures for
patients receiving a phi test result. In the prospective arm,
147 of 162 men (90.7%) were undergoing their first biopsy
(22 of 184 men did not have a biopsy history reported),
and in the historical arm, 339 of 355 men (95.5%) were
undergoing their first biopsy (57 of 412 men did not have a
biopsy history reported). The proportion of positive biopsy
findings did not increase in the prospective group, while
there was a modest decrease in the overall percentage
of low-grade Gleason 6 tumors detected compared to the
historical control group (9.9% vs. 18.4%, respectively).
Table 3 summarizes the physician-reported decision
impact of the phi test result on their patient management
plan, based on their Pre-Test vs. Post-Test Questionnaire
responses. Overall, 72.5% of the physician responses indi-
cated that the phi score did impact their patient management
plan after accounting for other clinical factors. This inclu-
ded 43% of cases where the physician reported a changed
biopsy recommendation based on the phi result, and 19% of
cases where the preliminary monitoring strategy was mod-
ified based on the phi result (i.e., more or less frequent
follow-up and/or inclusion of additional testing such as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). Additionally, 92% of
physician responses indicated that knowledge of the phi
score was helpful when communicating their recommen-
dation to the patient, including 28% of cases where a
“reduced risk” phi score was helpful in alleviating the
patient’s anxiety about the likelihood of significant cancer.
Discussion
This large study represents the only multicenter study to
date investigating the impact of phi testing on biopsy
decisions for patients presenting with elevated serum PSA
and non-suspicious DRE findings. Our study compared a
prospective group of patients assessed with phi to a non-phi
historical cohort evaluated by the same participating phy-
sicians within the previous 24 months. Physicians were
more inclined to defer biopsy when phi testing was included
in their overall assessment, resulting in a net 24% reduction
in biopsies performed compared to the historical control
group. In addition, we observed an overall reduction in the
percentage of low-grade Gleason score 6 tumors detected
with phi.
Most recently, Tosoian et al. [28] reported similar find-
ings with phi testing in their large academic center practice
at Johns Hopkins University. A prospective registry of 345
men receiving a phi result was compared to a contemporary
cohort of 1318 men who did not undergo phi testing. Their
comparative analysis showed that phi testing reduced the
rate of biopsy procedures performed without changing the
frequency of higher-grade cancers detected. Overall, 39% of
men in their registry underwent a biopsy when phi was
included in the assessment, representing a 9% reduction in
the rate of prostate biopsy procedures performed compared
to the control group (48%, P < 0.001). 91% of men with phi
<27 who underwent a biopsy had either a non-cancerous
result or low-grade (Gleason score 6) pathology, whereas
76% of men with phi >55 had Gleason score ≥7 cancers. For
men receiving an MRI as part of their assessment, the phi
score was also shown to provide complimentary informa-
tion for ruling out significant prostate cancer.

 The two-part questionnaire used in our study was helpful
for elucidating how knowledge of the phi result impacted
the physician’s management decision to perform a biopsy or
monitor the patient. According to the responses, physicians
were less inclined to biopsy patients receiving a low phi
score, and more inclined to recommend biopsy for patients
receiving an intermediate to high-risk phi score (phi ≥36).
phi also improved the physician’s ability to communicate
their recommendation to the patient, and helped alleviate
patient anxiety in cases where the phi score was low.
Although our study was not sufficiently powered to
demonstrate differences in pathological staging, a number
of published studies have shown that elevated phi scores
can predict higher-grade prostate cancers (Gleason score ≥7)
[26, 29–36]. The predictive accuracy can vary depending on
the patient cohort investigated, however. For example, a
recently published review reported AUC values ranging
from 0.707 to 0.82 [37]. The lowest AUC value excluded
men with suspicious DRE findings [29], whereas the
highest AUC value included 23.7% of men who reportedly
had an abnormal DRE [34]. In all cases, phi predicted
aggressive prostate cancer with AUC values that were sig-
nificantly greater than those for %fPSA or tPSA.
As previously reported in simulated budget impact stu-
dies [38, 39], the addition of phi testing represents a cost-
effective strategy for prostate cancer detection while
avoiding unnecessary biopsies. The present study demon-
strates this benefit in real world clinical practice.
Our study included four large urology group practices
representing diverse regions across the United States. One
strength of our study was the enrollment of patients seen by
the same participating physicians for the prospective and
historical control groups. Weaknesses include no use of
randomization and lack of longitudinal follow-up. These
were not utilized since our study was intended to be strictly
observational and was designed to measure decision impact
at the point of the urologist consultation. Further studies are
needed to address questions of long-term patient outcomes
from subsequent biopsy procedures and later episodes of
care.
Conclusions
This represents the largest prospective study to date inves-
tigating the clinical utility of phi testing for men undergoing
a diagnostic assessment for PCa. Overall, phi impacted the
physician’s patient management decision in 73% of obser-
vational cases. Fewer men were biopsied when phi testing
was included in the assessment (36% vs. 60% historically),
along with an overall reduction in the percentage of low-
grade Gleason score 6 cancers detected. Our results show
that appropriate utilization of phi can significantly modify
physician behavior patterns and improve their ability to
diagnose and manage their patients. We believe our study
supports the routine use of phi testing for men presenting
with elevated serum total PSA and non-suspicious DRE
findings.
