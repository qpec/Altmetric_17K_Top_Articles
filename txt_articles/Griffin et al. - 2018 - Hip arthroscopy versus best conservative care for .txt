Summary
Background Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is an important cause of hip pain in young adults. It can be 
treated by arthroscopic hip surgery, including reshaping the hip, or with physiotherapist-led conservative care. We 
aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of hip arthroscopy with best conservative care.
Methods UK FASHIoN is a pragmatic, multicentre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, done at 23 National 
Health Service hospitals in the UK. We enrolled patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome who 
presented at these hospitals. Eligible patients were at least 16 years old, had hip pain with radiographic features of 
cam or pincer morphology but no osteoarthritis, and were believed to be likely to benefit from hip arthroscopy. 
Patients with bilateral femoroacetabular impingement syndrome were eligible; only the most symptomatic hip was 
randomly assigned to treatment and followed-up. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive hip arthroscopy 
or personalised hip therapy (an individualised, supervised, and progressive physiotherapist-led programme of 
conservative care). Randomisation was stratified by impingement type and recruiting centre and was done by research 
staff at each hospital, using a central telephone randomisation service. Patients and treating clinicians were not 
masked to treatment allocation, but researchers who collected the outcome assessments and analysed the results 
were masked. The primary outcome was hip-related quality of life, as measured by the patient-reported International 
Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) 12 months after randomisation, and analysed in all eligible participants who were 
allocated to treatment (the intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered as an International Standard 
Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN64081839, and is closed to recruitment.
Findings Between July 20, 2012, and July 15, 2016, we identified 648 eligible patients and recruited 348 participants: 
171 participants were allocated to receive hip arthroscopy and 177 to receive personalised hip therapy. Three further 
patients were excluded from the trial after randomisation because they did not meet the eligibility criteria. Follow-up 
at the primary outcome assessment was 92% (319 of 348 participants). At 12 months after randomisation, mean 
iHOT-33 scores had improved from 39·2 (SD 20·9) to 58·8 (27·2) for participants in the hip arthroscopy group, and 
from 35·6 (18·2) to 49·7 (25·5) in the personalised hip therapy group. In the primary analysis, the mean difference 
in iHOT-33 scores, adjusted for impingement type, sex, baseline iHOT-33 score, and centre, was 6·8 (95% CI 
1·7–12·0) in favour of hip arthroscopy (p=0·0093). This estimate of treatment effect exceeded the minimum clinically 
important difference (6·1 points). There were 147 patient-reported adverse events (in 100 [72%] of 138 patients) in the 
hip arthroscopy group) versus 102 events (in 88 [60%] of 146 patients) in the personalised hip therapy group, with 
muscle soreness being the most common of these (58 [42%] vs 69 [47%]). There were seven serious adverse events 
reported by participating hospitals. Five (83%) of six serious adverse events in the hip arthroscopy group were related 
to treatment, and the one in the personalised hip therapy group was not. There were no treatment-related deaths, but 
one patient in the hip arthroscopy group developed a hip joint infection after surgery.
Interpretation Hip arthroscopy and personalised hip therapy both improved hip-related quality of life for patients with 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Hip arthroscopy led to a greater improvement than did personalised hip 
therapy, and this difference was clinically significant. Further follow-up will reveal whether the clinical benefits of  hip 
arthroscopy are maintained and whether it is cost effective in the long term.

Introduction
Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is a painful 
disorder of the hip that is caused by a premature contact 
(impingement) between the femur and acetabulum during 
hip movements.1,2 This premature contact typically occurs 
as a result of certain hip shapes, such as cam or pincer

morphology.1 Cam morphology refers to a flattening or 
convexity at the femoral head neck junction, whereas 
pincer morphology refers to a focal or global over-coverage 
of the femoral head by the acetabulum.1 Femoroacetabular 
impingement syndrome leads to progressive damage 
within the joint, including the acetabular labrum and 
articular cartilage,1 and is associated with the development 
of osteoarthritis of the hip.1,3
Surgery has become an established treatment for 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. The aim of 
such surgery is to reshape the hip joint to prevent 
impingement.2 Intra-articular injury, such as a cartilage 
and labral damage, can be resected, repaired, or recon-
structed.2 Initially, open surgery was used to treat 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, but the mini-
mally invasive, so-called keyhole technique known as hip 
arthroscopy is now being used more frequently.1 This 
approach has become possible because of advances in 
technology and surgical techniques. Hip arthroscopy is 
safer and has a shorter recovery time than does open 
surgery.4,5 In the UK in 2013, 1908 operations for 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome were done by 
arthroscopic surgery, compared with only 491 by open 
surgery.6 Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the 
use of hip arthroscopy in most countries around the 
world.4–6 Non-operative treatments for femoroacetabular 
impingement syndrome are also available,2 including 
exercise-based packages of conservative care, delivered by 
a physio 
therapist.7 Potential targets for physiotherapy 
include the abnormal movement patterns and weakness 
of hip muscles seen in patients with femoroacetabular 
impingement syndrome.8,9
Numerous case series report improvement in patients 
with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome after 
open or arthroscopic surgery, or physiotherapy.5,10 How-
ever, a 2014 Cochrane review11 of surgery for treating 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome showed that 
there was no evidence from randomised controlled trials 
to support these treatments.
In a feasibility study,6 we established that patients were 
prepared to be recruited, and that surgeons were in 
equipoise and willing to recruit patients to a randomised 
controlled trial of hip arthroscopy compared with best 
conservative care. Our aim was to measure the clinical 
effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with best 
conservative care in treating patients with femoro-
acetabular impingement syndrome.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this pragmatic, multicentre, assessor-blind 
randomised controlled trial in 23 National Health Service 
(NHS) hospitals in the UK. We treated the initial 
feasibility study6 as an internal pilot study so that 
participants who took part in the initial study were 
included in the main trial recruitment.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is a relatively 
common non-arthritic cause of hip pain in young adults. It is  
caused by symptomatic premature contact between the 
proximal femur and acetabular rim during hip motion, and 
this phenomenon is associated with certain hip shapes. 
Repeated impingement leads to damage to the articular 
cartilage or to acetabular labral tears, and it is these injuries 
that are thought to be painful. In the past decade, surgeons 
have developed arthroscopic (ie, keyhole) surgical techniques 
to treat femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. The 
rationale is that reshaping the hip and repairing cartilage and 
labral damage will prevent impingement and relieve 
symptoms. In 2013, we did a Cochrane systematic review of 
the effectiveness of hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular 
impingement syndrome. We searched MEDLINE (from 1946 
to Nov 19, 2013), Embase (1980 to Nov 19, 2013), and the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (issue 11, 2013), 
for randomised controlled trials of surgery compared with 
placebo treatment, non-operative treatment, or no treatment, 
in any language, in human adults with femoroacetabular 
impingement syndrome. We found no high-quality evidence 
examining the effectiveness of surgery for femoroacetabular 
impingement syndrome. Therefore, we chose to do a 
pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial to 
determine the effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with 
best conservative care.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised controlled 
trial to show the clinical effectiveness of hip arthroscopy in 
treating femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. We have 
shown that patients with femoroacetabular impingement 
syndrome have better hip-related quality of life at 12 months 
since randomisation with either hip arthroscopy or best 
conservative care (personalised hip therapy), and that this 
quality of life improves significantly more in patients treated 
hip arthroscopy, exceeding the minimal clinically important 
difference. Hip arthroscopy was also more expensive than was 
personalised hip therapy.
Implications of all the available evidence
Over the past 15 years, increasing numbers of patients with 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome have been treated 
with hip arthroscopy. This is the first study to show that hip 
arthroscopy is more clinically effective, at least in the 
short term, than best conservative care. Longer-term outcomes 
are required to establish whether this improvement is 
sustained and whether surgery is cost-effective. These results 
should be shared with patients when selecting an appropriate 
treatment strategy.

Participants were recruited from the specialist hip 
arthroscopy service at each hospital. Participating 
surgeons identified eligible patients during routine 
diagnostic consultations. Assessments were medical 
history, clinical examination, X-rays, and cross-sectional 
imaging (MRI, CT, or both). For patients with a diagnosis 
of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, the 
surgeon classified them as having cam (alpha angle 
>55°), pincer (lateral centre-edge angle >40° or a positive 
crossover sign), or mixed-type (combination of cam and 
pincer) impingement.12
Patients were eligible if they had hip pain, radiographic 
features of cam or pincer morphology, were at least 
16 years old, were able to give informed consent, and if 
the treating surgeon believed that they were likely to 
benefit from hip arthroscopy. Patients were excluded if 
they had hip osteoarthritis (Tonnis grade >1 or less than 
2 mm of superior joint space on an antero-posterior 
radiograph); a history of hip pathology such as Perthes’ 
disease, slipped upper femoral epiphysis, or avascular 
necrosis, or previous hip injury such as acetabular 
fracture, hip dislocation, or femoral neck fracture; or if 
they had already had shape-changing surgery (open 
or arthroscopic) of the hip.13,14 Patients with bilateral 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome were eligible, 
and only the most symptomatic hip was randomly 
assigned to treatment and followed up. Trained research 
associates approached eligible patients to explain the trial 
and to invite them to participate. All participants gave 
written informed consent.
Qualitative research, to understand recruitment as it 
occurred, was integrated into the trial. The findings were 
used to design a recruiter training and centre support 
programme that was implemented during the trial to 
optimise recruit 
ment. The research was based on the 
QuinteT Recruitment Intervention and continued the 
work done during the internal pilot trial.15,16
The study was approved by NHS Research Ethics 
Service West Midlands (14/WM/0124). An independent 
trial steering committee and data monitoring committee 
provided oversight of the progression of the study. The 
study protocol has previously been published.17
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with a 
computer-generated minimisation (adaptive stratified 
sampling) algorithm for centre and type of impingement, 
to receive either hip arthroscopy or best conservative care. 
All baseline data were collected before randomisation, 
which was done by the recruiting research associate. 
Allocation concealment was ensured by use of a secure 
telephone randomisation service hosted by Warwick 
Clinical Trials Unit. It was not possible to mask patients 
or the treating clinicians to their allocation. Researchers 
who collected outcome assessments and analysed the 
results were masked to allocation by concealment of 
treatment.
Procedures
Surgery for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome 
was done using arthroscopic techniques by a senior 
surgeon (consultant grade) in the NHS, who was trained 
and experienced in hip arthroscopy. Further details 
about surgeons’ training and experience, and surgical 
procedures are shown in the appendix. 27 trial surgeons 
did the surgery. Hip arthroscopy was done under general 
anaesthesia in a lateral or supine position. Arthroscopic 
portals were established in the central and peripheral 
compartments of the hip under radiographic guidance 
according to the surgeon’s usual practice. Shape abnor-
malities and consequent labral and cartilage pathology 
were treated. Adequacy of bony reshaping was assessed 
by intraoperative image intensifier views or by arthro-
scopic visualisation of a satisfactory impingement free 
range of movement of the hip, or both. Patients were 
allowed home when they could walk safely with crutches 
(typically within 24 h). Patients were referred to outpatient 
physiotherapy services for a course of rehabilitation as 
per usual care for that surgeon. These post-operative 
physiotherapists were distinct from those providing 
conservative care, to avoid contamination between 
groups. Patients had MRI of their hip at least 6 weeks 
after surgery.
A panel of international experts assessed the fidelity of 
the surgery (appendix). They reviewed operation notes, 
intraoperative images, and postoperative MRI scans to 
subjectively assess whether adequate surgery had 
been undertaken, according to the protocol. The panel 
discussed each case and subjectively assessed whether 
shape abnormalities and intra-articular pathology were 
treated, and whether there was a sufficient resection 
to allow impingement-free range of motion. This 
approach included assessing the proximal femoral and 
acetabular rim resections and whether the resection 
edges were smooth.
Personalised hip therapy is a package of physio 
therapist-
led rehabilitation for femoroacetabular im 
pinge 
ment 
syndrome. It was developed during our feasibility study 
and tested during the pilot study.6 Although the name for 
this intervention is new, the care offered was based on 
a consensus of what physiotherapists, physicians, and 
surgeons currently regard as best conservative care for 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome.7 Personalised 
hip therapy has four core components: an assessment 
of pain, function, and range of hip motion; patient 
education; an exercise programme taught in the clinic 
and repeated at home, that has the key features of 
individualisation, progression, and supervision; and help 
with pain relief, which could include one X-ray 
or ultrasound-guided intra-articular steroid injection 
when pain prevents performance of the exercise pro-
gramme.18
Personalised hip therapy was delivered by at least one 
physiotherapist at each centre. 47 physiotherapists were 
trained formally in this protocol through a 1-day

workshop and sup 
ported to deliver personalised hip 
therapy through refresher workshops (appendix). At 
their initial assessment, participants received a 
personalised hip therapy information pack that 
described what to expect during the course of their 
treatment. They then had between six and ten face-to-
face contacts with the physiotherapist over 12–24 weeks. 
Some contacts were allowed by either telephone or 
email when geographical distance prevented all contacts 
being 
carried 
out 
face-to-face. 
Patient-completed 
exercise diaries were also encouraged to help both 
patients and physiotherapists monitor progress and 
adherence with personalised hip therapy.
Physiotherapists recorded full details of their advice 
and treatments, number and type of treatment con-
tacts, and any non-attendance, on case report forms. 
These case report forms were reviewed for accuracy 
in comparison to the usual physiotherapy records at each 
treatment centre and then assessed for fidelity to the 
personalised hip therapy protocol by a panel comprising 
members of the core group who developed the protocol 
for personalised hip therapy (appendix). The personalised 
hip therapy panel reviewed case report forms to ensure 
participants received an ade 
quate number of sessions, all 
four core components, and that their exercise programme 
was individualised, supervised, and progressive.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was hip-related quality of life, as 
measured by the international Hip Outcome Tool 
(iHOT-33) at 12 months after randomisation.19 iHOT-33 is 
a 
patient-derived 
and 
patient-reported 
outcome 
instrument designed to measure hip-related quality of life 
in young adults with non-arthritic hip pain. The iHOT-33 
consists of four domains: symptoms and functional 
limitations; sports and recreational physical activities; job-
related concerns; and social, emotional, and lifestyle 
concerns.18 iHOT-33 provides a 100-point score, with 
100 representing no pain and perfect function, and lower 
scores indicating pain and poor function. The instrument 
has been validated in a relevant population for this trial,19 
and has a minimum clinically important difference of 
6·1 points.19,20 Secondary outcomes were health-related 
quality of life, measured with the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L, the 
12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12 version 2), 
adverse events, and health-care resource use, all measured 
6 and 12 months after treatment allocation.21–23 Patients 
reported adverse events 6 weeks after the start of their 
intervention (first session of personalised hip therapy, or 
date of hip arthroscopy). Any serious adverse events were 
reported by each centre to the Warwick Clinical Trials 
Unit. Forms for iHOT-33, EQ-5D-5L, SF-12, adverse 
events, and health-care resource use were collected by 
postal questionnaires, which were centrally administered. 
Scores for these measures were collected at the time of 
consent and again by postal questionnaire at 6 and 
12 months after treatment allocation.

16 points and a minimum clinically important difference 
of 6·1 points, giving a standardised effect size of 0·38. 
We designed the trial to have 90% power to detect an 
effect of this size at a two-sided 5% significance level, 
allowing for up to 15% loss to follow-up at the primary 
outcome timepoint.
We prepared a full statistical analysis plan before the 
final analysis. No interim analyses were planned. The 
plan was approved by the independent data monitoring 
committee.
In our primary analysis, we investigated differences in 
the primary outcome measure, (iHOT-33 score at 
12 months after randomisation) between the two treat-
ment groups on a intention-to-treat basis, which included 
all eligible patients randomly assigned to an intervention. 
We assessed the primary outcome 12 months from 
treatment allocation rather than from intervention 
because this was a pragmatic trial design of two different 
treatment strategies. We used a mixed-effects regression 
analysis to assess the effects of the interventions on 
12-month iHOT-33 scores, after adjusting for the fixed-
effects of impingement type, sex, and baseline iHOT-33 
score, with recruiting centre included as a random effect 
to model any potential associations within the recruiting 
centres. This mixed-effects model was used for all 
outcome measures.
We drew our primary inferences from the intention-to-
treat analysis, irrespective of compliance, without 
imputation for missing data. We also did several 
additional analyses. We did a per-protocol analysis, 
comparing participants who actually received surgery and 
those who actually received personalised hip therapy. 
Additionally, 
we 
compared 
participants 
randomly 
allocated to hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy, 
who received an allocated treatment that was deemed to 
be of high fidelity. We did prespecified subgroup analyses 
for different impingement types (cam, pincer, and mixed) 
and for patients younger and older than 40 years. We 
added pairwise interaction terms between treatment 
group and both impingement type and age group to the 
mixed-effects model to test for important subgroup 
effects. In addition to the primary adjusted analysis, we 
also reported unadjusted differences between groups, 
and we assessed significance using t tests for normally 
distributed outcomes. We present treatment effect 
estimates from the adjusted mixed-effects model (primary 
analysis) with 95% CIs. All hypothesis testing was at the 
5% level, with no adjustments for multiple testing. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis of secondary 
outcomes followed the same modelling approach as for 
the primary outcome. All analyses were on a complete-
case basis and where follow-up data were missing, the 
reasons for missing data were obtained and patterns were 
investigated to judge the plausibility of missingness 
assumptions. We did a sensitivity analysis using multiple 
imputation techniques (imputation using chained 
equations) to assess the effect of missing data on the 
primary outcome. Finally, we did a post-hoc sensitivity 
analysis of the effect of variation in recovery time in the 
hip arthroscopy group. We compared post-intervention 
adverse events between groups using Fisher’s exact test. 
We did all analyses using Stata (version 14).24
We did an economic evaluation from the perspective of 
the NHS and personal social services.25 We estimated 
economic costs associated with the delivery of the two 
interventions. Resource use questions completed by 
participants at each assessment point provided a profile of

all hospital inpatient and outpatient service use, 
community health and social care encounters, prescribed 
medications, and NHS supplies, such as crutches or home 
adaptations. We obtained unit costs (2016 £) from primary 
and secondary sources in accordance with national 
guidelines and attached them to every item of resource 
use.24 We used health utilities generated from EQ-5D-5L 
responses at every timepoint of assessment to estimate 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) profiles for every 
participant; these QALYs were calculated as the area under 
the baseline-adjusted utility curve, assuming linear 
interpolation between utility measurements. We did a 
bivariate regression of costs and QALYs, with multiple 
imputation of missing data, with the view to estimating 
the incremental cost per QALY gained for hip arthroscopy 
compared with personalised hip therapy. Further details, 
including sensitivity analyses done to assess the effect 
of uncertainty surrounding aspects of the economic 
evaluation, and prespecified subgroup analyses exploring 
heterogeneity in the cost-effectiveness results, are 
provided in the appendix. The trial is registered as an 
International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, 
number ISRCTN64081839.

Between July 20, 2012, and July 15, 2016, 648 patients 
who attended the participating surgeons’ hip clinics were 
deemed eligible (figure 1). Of these patients, 348 (54%) 
agreed to participate. The mean age of participants was 
35·3 years (SD 9·6); the mean age of those who declined 
to participate was 35·4 years (10·3). The 348 participants 
were randomly allocated to receive hip arthroscopy 
(n=171) or personalised hip therapy (n=177). Three 
additional patients were randomly allocated in error, in 
each instance contrary to protocol procedures. One 
participant, who was not eligible, was recruited after 
miscommunication between the treating surgeon and 
recruiter; one patient was allocated without signing the 
consent form; and one patient was deemed eligible by a 
trainee surgeon, but within a few days the treating 
surgeon deemed they were not eligible. None of these 
patients participated in the trial (figure 1).
Participants in the two groups were well matched 
in terms of demographics and pre-randomisation hip-
related quality of life, having had symptoms for 
approximately 3 years (table 1). 14 (8%) participants who 
were allocated to personalised hip therapy had all or part 
of this intervention, but then, at their request, went 
on to have hip arthroscopy within 12 months after 
randomisation. No patients allocated to hip arthroscopy 
had personalised hip therapy. For hip arthroscopy, the 
median time from random assignment to treatment 
was 122 days (IQR 80–185), and for personalised hip 
therapy, it was 37 days (22–60). Surgeons did a mean of 
112 (SD 55) hip arthroscopies per year during the study. 
At 12 months after randomisation, 144 (84%) of the 
171 participants allocated to receive hip arthroscopy had 
received it; 27 (16%) had not. 121 (84%) participants who 
received a hip arthroscopy procedure had postoperative 
MRI and their case was assessed by the surgical review 
panel; 105 (87%) of these 121 procedures were deemed to 
be of high fidelity, and 16 (13%) were deemed 
unsatisfactory. The reasons for unsatisfactory surgery

were an inadequate bony resection of the proximal femur 
(n=7) and acetabular rim (n=2), a sharp transition from 
the femoral head to neck as a result of reshaping surgery 
(n=5), and no reshaping surgery being done because the 
hip was degenerate (n=2). Nine (5%) of the 177 participants 
allocated to personalised hip therapy did not receive any 
treatment by 12 months. Of the patients who received 
personalised hip therapy (n=154), 107 (70%) were judged 
to have received the intervention to a high fidelity 
(appendix). The most common reason for low fidelity of 
personalised hip therapy was participants not receiving 
the minimum of six therapy sessions (34 [72%] of 47). 
Other reasons for low-fidelity personalised hip therapy 
were no progression of exercises by the physiotherapist 
(11 [23%] of 47) and the patient not complying with the 
exercise programme (two [4%] of 47).
319 (92%) of 348 participants completed the iHOT-33 
questionnaires at 12 months after randomisation. 
Seven (2%) withdrew from follow-up, and 22 (6%) were 
lost to follow-up. The iHOT-33 score increased in both 
groups, indicating an improvement in hip-related 
quality of life (table 2, figure 2). 12 months after 
randomisation, mean iHOT-33 scores had improved 
from 39·2 (SD 21) to 58·8 (27) for participants in the hip 
arthroscopy group, and from 35·6 (18) to 49·7 (25) in 
the personalised hip therapy group. In the primary 
intention-to-treat analysis at 12 months, the adjusted 
estimate of treatment effect measured with iHOT-33 
was 6·8 (95% CI 1·7 to 12·0, p=0·0093) in favour of hip 
arthroscopy, compared with personalised hip therapy. 
In the per-protocol analysis at 12 months, including 
participants who received personalised hip therapy 
(n=154) or hip arthroscopy (n=144), the adjusted estimate 
of the between-group difference on iHOT-33 was 8·2 
(95% CI 2·8 to 13·6) in favour of hip arthroscopy. In the 
exploratory, pre-specified secondary analysis based on 
those participants whose treatment was deemed of a 
high fidelity (hip arthroscopy n=105, personalised hip 
therapy n=107), the adjusted estimate of between-group 
difference on the iHOT-33 was 5·8 (95% CI –0·7 to 12·2) 
in favour of hip arthroscopy. There were no significant 
between-group differences in SF-12 or EQ-5D-5L scores 
at 6 or 12 months after randomisation (table 2).
In the prespecified subgroup analyses, the between-
group difference for iHOT-33 was 5·0 (95% CI 
–1·2 to 11·3) in participants younger than 40 years and 
10·9 (1·7 to 20·1) in those older than 40 years 
(pinteraction=0·3023) in favour of hip arthroscopy; the 
difference was 8·3 (95% CI 2·5 to 14·2) in patients with 
cam morphology, 1·1 (–11·5 to 13·7) in those with mixed 
cam and pincer morphology, and 4·0 (–14·6 to 22·7) in 
those with pincer morphology (pinteraction=0·5672), in favour 
of hip arthroscopy.
Among patients who received their allocated inter-
vention, there were 147 patient-reported adverse events 
(in 100 [73%] of 138 patients) in the hip arthroscopy 
group versus 102 (in 88 [60%]) of 146 patients in the 
personalised hip therapy group. The most frequently 
reported adverse event was muscle soreness, reported 
by 58 (42%) patients in the hip arthroscopy group and 
69 (47%) patients in the personalised hip therapy group 
(table 3). At 12 months, seven serious adverse events 
had been reported by participating hospitals. Six of 
these were among the participants in the hip arthroscopy 
group: one patient was not discharged from the day 
surgery unit and required an overnight admission, 
one patient had scrotal haematoma requiring re 
ad-
mission, two patients had superficial wound infections 
that required oral antibiotics, one patient had a hip joint 
infection that required further surgery and ultimately a

total hip replacement, and one patient had a fall that 
was unrelated to hip arthroscopy. One participant in the 
personalised hip therapy group developed biliary sepsis 
that was unrelated to treatment. There were no 
treatment-related deaths.
There was a low level of missing item-level data 
(eg, iHOT-33 0·6%) in all patient-reported outcome 
measures at all timepoints; after imputation for missing 
data, the adjusted estimate of treatment effect was similar, 
at 6·6 (95% CI 1·7 to 11·4) points in favour of hip arthro-
scopy. In a post-hoc analysis there was no significant 
difference in iHOT-33 at 12 months for patients in the hip 
arthroscopy group who were treated within 6 months 
of randomisation versus those treated 6 months or more 
after randomisation (0·9 [95% CI –10·7 to 8·8]). We 
assessed model assumptions, including assessment of 
quantile-quantile plots, which were deemed adequate. 
The mean cost of hip arthroscopy was £3042 (35% staff
 
time, 28% surgical devices and anaesthetic drugs, 
19% theatre-running costs, and 18% bed-day costs). 
Participants in the personalised hip therapy group 
attended a mean of six physiotherapy sessions (average 
duration of 30 min), generating mean total treatment 
costs of £155 per participant. The adjusted incremental 
cost of hip arthro 
scopy compared with personalised hip 
therapy during the 12-month follow-up was £2372, with 
in 
cremental QALYs of –0·015 (representing a net QALY 
loss). Personalised hip therapy was more cost-effective 
than hip arthro 
scopy at 12 months (appendix).
Discussion
The UK FASHIoN study is the first randomised controlled 
trial to provide evidence that hip arthros 
copy is effective 
in 
patients 
with 
femoroacetabular 
impingement 
syndrome. In this pragmatic trial, we found that iHOT-33 
scores improved for patients in both groups; 12 months 
after randomisation, there was a mean adjusted difference 
of 6·8 points in the iHOT-33 score between patients 
allocated to receive hip arthroscopy and those allocated 
to receive personalised hip therapy, in favour of hip 
arthroscopy. This is a statistically significant difference 
that also exceeded the minimum clinically important 
difference for iHOT-33. These results are consistent with 
the hypothesis that hip arthroscopy is more clinically 
effective than best conservative care.
There have been many observational studies showing 
benefit from hip arthroscopy; however, these studies 
generally did not have control groups for comparison, 
and are at high risk of bias.6 Results from a Cochrane 
systematic review done by members of our group11 
showed that there had been no previous relevant 
randomised controlled trials. Since then, one recent 
randomised controlled trial26 has reported no difference 
between hip arthroscopy and conservative care. This 
study was small, was done in a military setting, with a 
single surgeon in a single centre, and with a very high 
rate of crossover (70%) from conservative care to hip 
arthroscopy.26 When the authors did a per-protocol 
comparison of those who had hip arthroscopy (n=66) 
with those who had conservative care (n=14), they reported 
that “power was lost making type II errors possible”.26 
They concluded that “large cohorts across multiple sites 
are needed to make definitive conclusions”.26 Our trial is 
larger and therefore has greater power to detect between-
group differences, and was done in 23 centres with a 
more generalisable patient population.
There were no differences between groups in the 
secondary outcome measure of general health-related 
quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and SF-12). This finding could 
either be because treatment for femoroacetabular 
impingement syndrome does not have an effect on health-
related quality of life or because the measures we used are 
not sufficiently sensitive to detect the changes that occur. A 
further possibility is that the trial was not sufficiently 
powered to detect changes in health-related quality of life.
Adverse events in the hip arthroscopy group were more 
frequent than in the personalised hip therapy group. 
However, there was only one serious surgical complication 
in which a patient developed a hip joint infection. In one 
systematic review of 36 761 cases,27 hip arthroscopy had a 
reported complication rate of 3·3%, with a rate of major 
complications of 0·2%; our study findings are consistent 
with this.
Our within-trial health economic evaluation suggests 
that hip arthroscopy is not cost-effective by comparison 
with personalised hip therapy. However, our economic 
models were only able to assess cost-effectiveness at 
12 months from randomisation. This finding must also be 
set in the context of the high initial treatment costs of hip 
arthroscopy, the treatment timing (long delay in patients 
receiving hip arthroscopy, reducing the period of potential 
benefit during follow-up), and the period of economic 
inactivity during postoperative recovery (appendix). There 
could be long-term benefits from treatment that were not 
assessed in this economic analysis. We plan further follow-
up points at 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, which will inform the 
lifetime cost-effectiveness of both surgery and personalised 
hip therapy, and whether treatment effects are maintained 
or if further treatments are required. Comparison of the 
rates of hip replacement in both groups will also help 
establish whether surgery affects the risk of osteoarthritis.1,3
Strengths of this trial include the consent to participate 
rate among eligible patients (54%) and the follow-up rate 
(92%). Both of these values are high compared with similar 
trials in orthopaedics, and especially with trials of surgery 
versus no surgery, contributing to external and internal 
validity.28 The integrated qualitative research optimised 
recruitment, as it has done in other trials.15 This trial was 
thoroughly pragmatic, exploring the effectiveness of a 
strategy of offering hip arthroscopy compared with 
conservative care in the everyday reality of a national health 
service, where patients do not always receive or comply 
with the treatment they are offered, where surgeons and 
physiotherapists have varying levels of training, skill, and

expertise, where postoperative care is variable, and where 
there are waiting lists for treatment. The large number of 
centres (n=23), surgeons (n=27), and physiotherapists 
(n=43) involved is a strength, which contributes to the 
generalisability of our findings. The comparator for this 
trial was personalised hip therapy, which we consider to be 
the best conservative care that can realistically be provided 
in the NHS for these patients. Personalised hip therapy 
was designed through international consensus and 
developed, supported, and tested in similar ways to other 
physiotherapist-led conservative care protocols.29 It meets 
the standards expected of a complex intervention in a 
randomised controlled trial, and was delivered by 
musculoskeletal physiotherapists who attended additional 
training and support events.6,7,30
Limitations of this trial include that participants and 
treating clinicians were not masked to treatment 
allocation. A blinded allocation trial, with a placebo 
control, would have been better suited to measuring the 
underlying effect of surgery. In our trial, the research 
question was whether hip arthroscopy or best conservative 
care was the most effective treatment strategy, leading to 
an inevitable absence of blinding. Data collection and 
analysis were done without revealing treatment allocation. 
An unexpected difficulty was the frequent delay in 
delivery of surgery for those patients allocated to hip 
arthroscopy. We had anticipated that this delay would be 
less than 3 months in most patients because when we 
designed the trial, there was a strongly enforced NHS 
target to treat patients within 18 weeks from referral to 
surgery. In fact, during the study, this target was a 
challenge in many hospitals. Patients allocated to hip 
arthroscopy therefore often had longer times to treatment, 
and because the primary outcome was measured 
12 months after randomisation, these patients were often 
still within a few months (and in some cases a few weeks) 
of their operation when we measured the primary 
outcome. Because of these delays, patients in the hip 
arthroscopy group had, on average, less time to recover 
before the primary outcome measurement than did 
patients in the personalised hip therapy group. We 
compared the outcome of hip arthroscopy participants 
who had surgery in the first 6 months after randomisation 
with those who had surgery in the second 6 months. 
There was no significant difference between these 
groups, suggesting that the systematic difference in 
time to treatment between groups does not account 
for the treatment effect. Our inferences about the 
effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with person-
alised hip therapy are limited to data collected 12 months 
after randomisation; long-term follow-up is required to 
establish if this effect is maintained and if further 
treatments are required.
The fact that not all surgery or personalised hip therapy 
was deemed to be of a high fidelity is also a reflection of 
the real-world setting in which this trial was done. 
Some surgery was not satisfactory, and some participants 
allocated to personalised hip therapy did not engage with it 
or complete it: our fidelity assessment showed high-fidelity 
treatment in 87% of patients receiving hip arthroscopy 
and 70% of patients receiving personalised hip therapy. 
However, these proportions are comparable with other 
studies and reflect the pragmatism of our trial.31 We took 
great effort to minimise crossover in our trial, using 
techniques developed in our feasibility study. No partici-
pants allocated to receive hip arthroscopy received 
personalised hip therapy; 14 participants allocated to 
personalised hip therapy subsequently changed their mind 
and decided to have surgery within 12 months. We do not 
believe that these crossovers can account for the results of 
this trial; indeed, we would expect such crossovers to dilute 
and so reduce our estimate of the real underlying effect of 
hip arthroscopy.
Personalised hip therapy is believed to work by 
improving muscle control, strength around the hip, and 
movement patterns, leading to the avoidance of hip 
impingement. Surgery is thought to work by reshaping 
the bone to prevent impingement and by treating painful 
injuries to articular cartilage and labrum. In our trial, the 
observed effect of hip arthroscopy over conservative care 
might be attributable to the surgical procedure, the 
placebo effect of surgery (given the unblinded nature of 
this trial), post-surgical rehabilitation, or a combination 
of these factors. The results of our subgroup analysis of 
patients with only cam morphology are suggestive of an 
increased treatment effect of hip arthroscopy compared 
with other shapes. This finding would support the idea 
that the removal of a cam shape has a specific therapeutic 
effect. The low number of patients with pincer or mixed 
cam and pincer morphology in this study means we 
are less certain about the influence of reshaping the 
acetabular rim. Ultimately, we do not fully understand 
the mechanism of benefit from hip arthroscopy or 
personalised hip therapy. Future research should focus 
on investigating these mechanisms further, and which 
patients would benefit most from hip arthroscopy or 
personalised hip therapy.
We have shown that offering hip arthroscopy to patients 
with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome led to 
better patient-assessed function 12 months after random-
isation, compared with best conservative care. This 
improvement comes at a cost; our study does not show 
cost-effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with 
conservative care within the first 12 months.

Acknowledgments
We are indebted to all patients who participated in the trial. We are 
grateful to the members of the trial steering committee, data monitoring 
and safety committee, and members of the UK FASHIoN Study Group 
for their contributions to this study. UK FASHIoN was jointly sponsored 
by the University of Warwick and the University Hospitals of Coventry 
and Warwickshire NHS Trust. This work is supported by the Health 
Technology Assessment Programme of the NIHR (feasibility and pilot 
trial grant number 10/41/02, full trial grant number 13/103/02). The UK 
Comprehensive Research Network also supported this trial. JLD is 
supported by the MRC ConDuCT Hub for Trials Methodology Research 
(MR/K025643/1), and the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied 
Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) West at University Hospitals 
Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, and is an NIHR Senior Investigator 
(NF-SI-0507-10213). SP is an NIHR Senior Investigator 
(NF-SI-0616-10103). NEF is an NIHR Senior Investigator, and was 
supported through an NIHR Research Professorship (NIHR-RP-011-015). 
This project benefited from facilities funded through Birmingham 
Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure 
Trials Platform, with support from Advantage West Midlands and the
