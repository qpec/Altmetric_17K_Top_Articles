Most common breast cancer susceptibility variants have been identified 
through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of predominantly estrogen 
receptor (ER)-positive disease1. We conducted a GWAS using 21,468 ER-
negative cases and 100,594 controls combined with 18,908 BRCA1 mutation 
carriers (9,414 with breast cancer), all of European origin. We identified 
independent associations at P<5x10-8 with 10 variants at nine novel loci. At 
P<0.05, we replicated associations with 10 of 11 variants previously reported in 
ER-negative or BRCA1 mutation carrier GWASs, and observed consistent 
associations with ER-negative disease for 105 susceptibility variants identified 
by other breast cancer GWASs. These 125 variants explain approximately 16% 
of the familial risk of this breast cancer subtype. There was high genetic 
correlation (0.72) between risk of ER-negative breast cancer and breast cancer 
risk for BRCA1 carriers. These findings will likely lead to improved risk 
prediction and inform further fine-mapping and functional work to better 
understand the biological basis of ER-negative breast cancer.  
GWASs have identified 107 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are 
independently associated with breast cancer risk2-32. Association studies focused on 
ER-negative disease, or BRCA1 mutation carriers, who are more likely to develop 
ER-negative disease (70-80% of cases)33, have identified 11 of these 
SNPs3,9,12,19,29,30. We aimed to discover additional ER-negative breast cancer 
susceptibility variants by performing a GWAS in women of European origin. 
New genotyping data were generated for 9,655 ER-negative cases and 45,494 
controls from 68 Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) studies and 15,566 
BRCA1 mutation carriers (7,784 with breast cancer) from 58 Consortium of 
Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) studies (Supplementary Tables 1 
and 2) using the Illumina OncoArray beadchip, a 570K SNP custom array with 
genome-wide coverage34. Imputation was used to derive estimated genotypes for 
~21M SNPs, using the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 3) as reference; ~11.5M of 
those with imputation r2>0.3 and minor allele frequency (MAF)>0.005 were included 
in further analyses. For BCAC data, we estimated per-allele odds ratios (ORs) using 
logistic regression, adjusting for country and principal components. For CIMBA data, 
we estimated per-allele hazard ratios (HR) using a retrospective cohort analysis 
framework, modelling time to breast cancer and stratifying on country, Ashkenazi 
Jewish origin and birth cohort35,36 (see Online Methods). These analyses were also 
applied to an independent set of previously generated data from other genome-wide 
genotyping of additional European participants in 44 BCAC studies (11,813 ER-
negative cases and 55,100 controls)9,12,16,20,37,38 and 54 CIMBA studies (3,342 
BRCA1 mutation carriers, 1,630 with breast cancer) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 
2). Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to combine results across genotyping 
initiatives within consortia and, assuming that the OR and HR estimates approximate 
the same underlying relative risk, across consortia39.   
Results from the combined meta-analysis are summarised in Supplementary Figures 
1 and 2. There was minimal inflation of test statistics (lambda1000=1.004; 
 Supplementary Figure 3). We identified 10 variants at nine novel loci that were 
independently associated with risk of ER-negative breast cancer at P<5x10-8 (Table 
1; Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Figures 4-11). Two independent signals 
were observed within 12kb at 11q22.3, for rs74911261 (MAF=0.02) and rs11374964 
(MAF=0.42); OR estimates and statistical significance were largely unchanged when 
each variant was adjusted for the other (Supplementary Table 4). The association 
with 8p23.3-rs66823261 was not observed for BRCA1 mutation carriers (P=0.32, P-
heterogeneity=0.030).   
For each of these 10 novel signals, we identified candidate causal SNPs 
analytically40,41 (see Online Methods) and combined multiple sources of in silico 
functional annotation from public databases42-52 to identify likely functional variants 
and target genes. Results are summarised in Supplementary Table 5 (including 
UCSC Genome Browser links; see also Supplementary Note), Figure 1 and 
Supplementary Figures 4-11 (data sources in Supplementary Table 6). Many 
candidate causal SNPs lie in predicted regulatory regions and are associated with 
expression of nearby genes in blood or other tissues. At 2p23, the predicted target 
genes include ADCY3 and NCOA1 (Supplementary Figure 4). At 6q23.1 
(Supplementary Figure 5), the most plausible target gene is L3MBTL353. A predicted 
target at 8q24.13 is FBXO32, which is expressed in ER-negative HMECs but not ER-
positive MCF7 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 7) and has a known role in 
cancer cachexia54. At 11q22.3 (Figure 1), a predicted target gene of common risk-
associated variants is NPAT55. The rarer SNPs underlying the other 11q22.3 signal 
are predicted to target ATM, a known breast cancer susceptibility gene56. Three rare 
coding variants (MAF≤0.03) in ATM, NPAT and KDELC2, are also among the 
candidate causal SNPs at this locus. At 16p13, predicted target genes include 
ADCY9 and CREBBP (Supplementary Figure 8). At 19q12 (Supplementary Figure 
11), a potential target gene encodes cyclin E1 which is involved in cell cycle control 
and phosphorylation of NPAT57. 
Expression QTL associations were assessed between each candidate causal variant 
and genes within 1Mb using 79 ER-negative breast tumours from TCGA and 135 
normal breast tissue samples from METABRIC58-60. The strongest associations 
identified were 6q23.1-rs6569648-L3MBTL3 (P=4.3x10-6) and 18q12.1-rs12965632-
CDH2 (P=1.0x10-4), both in METABRIC (Supplementary Table 5). SNP rs6569648 
was the top cis-eQTL (of all imputed variants within 1 Mb) for L3MBTL3 while the p-
value for the rs12965632-CDH2 eQTL was within two orders of magnitude of the top 
cis-eQTLs for this gene (Supplementary Figures 12-13). 
For 10 of the 11 variants previously identified through GWASs of ER-negative 
disease or overall disease in BRCA1 mutation carriers3,9,12,18,19,30,31, or reported as 
more strongly associated with ER-negative breast cancer29, associations with ER-
negative disease were replicated (P<0.05) using OncoArray data from BCAC, which 
does not overlap with any of the discovery studies (Table 2). Effect sizes were 
generally similar to those originally reported. Using all available CIMBA data, six of 
these 11 variants were associated with breast cancer risk (P<0.05) for BRCA1 
mutation carriers (Table 2). No evidence of association was observed for 20q11-
rs228437812 in either BCAC or CIMBA (P≥0.46).  
Based on estimated ORs using BCAC data for all cases with known ER status 
(16,988 ER-negative; 65,275 ER-positive), all 10 new and 10 previously reported 
 and replicated ER-negative disease susceptibility SNPs were more strongly 
associated with risk of ER-negative than ER-positive subtype (P-heterogeneity<0.05, 
except for novel hit 19p13.2-rs322144; Supplementary Table 7). Two variants 
(1q32.1-rs4245739 and 19p13.11-rs67397200) were not associated with ER-positive 
disease. For four variants (11q22.3- rs11374964, 11q22.3-rs74911261, 1q32.1-
rs6678914 and 2p23.2-rs4577244), the risk-associated allele for ER-negative 
disease was associated with reduced risk of ER-positive disease (P<0.05).  
For these 20 ER-negative breast cancer susceptibility SNPs, we also assessed 
associations by triple-negative (TN) status (negative for ER, progesterone receptor 
and HER2; Table 3), tumour grade (Table 4) and age at diagnosis (Supplementary 
Table 8) using BCAC data only. Five, including the novel susceptibility variants 
11q22.3-rs11374964 and 11q22.3-rs74911261, were more strongly associated with 
risk of both TN and higher-grade disease (P<0.05), although after adjustment for TN 
status, heterogeneity by grade was observed only for 11q22.3-rs74911261 and 
1q32.1-rs4245739 (P<0.05). For 2p23.3-rs4577244, heterogeneity was observed for 
grade only, while 6q25.2-rs2747652 was more strongly associated with risk of other 
(non-TN) ER-negative breast cancer subtypes (P<0.05). At younger ages, 
associations appeared to be stronger for two variants (5p15.33-rs10069690 and 
19p13.11-rs67397200), and weaker for one (6q25.2-rs2747652) (P<0.05).  
Elsewhere we report 65 novel susceptibility loci for overall breast cancer1. Three of 
these overlap within 500kb with the novel ER-negative disease-associated loci 
reported here (variants 2p23.3-rs200648189, 6q23.1-rs6569648 and 8q24.13-
rs17350191). We assessed associations with risk of ER-negative disease, and with 
risk of overall breast cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers, for SNPs at the remaining 
62 loci, as well as for the 96 previously reported breast cancer susceptibility variants 
that were not ER-negative specific. Of these 158 SNPs, 105 were associated 
(P<0.05) with risk of ER-negative breast cancer, and 24 with risk for BRCA1 
mutation carriers (Supplementary Tables 9-10). Results for BRCA2 mutation carriers 
are presented in Supplementary Table 11. 
Pathway analysis based on mapping each SNP to the nearest gene was performed 
using summary association statistics from the meta-analysis of BCAC and CIMBA 
data combined61-64 (see Online Methods). This identified several pathways 
implicated in ER-negative disease (enrichment score [ES]≥0.41; Supplementary 
Figure 14; Supplementary Tables 12-13), including a subset that was not enriched in 
susceptibility to ER-positive disease (ES<0; Supplementary Table 14). One of the 
latter subsets was the adenylate cyclase (AC) activating pathway (ES=0.62; 
Supplementary Figure 15). Two of the predicted target genes for the 10 novel ER-
negative breast cancer susceptibility variants, based on the eQTL analysis 
(Supplementary Table 5), ADCY3 (P[TCGA]=6.7x10-3] and ADCY9 
(P[METABRIC]=1.3x10-4), are part of this pathway, and their association signals 
were critical to the elevated ES observed (Supplementary Figure 14). ADCY9 is 
stimulated by �2 adrenergic receptor (�2AR) signalling65 in ER-negative breast 
cancer66, which in turn drives AC-cAMP signalling, including for example mitogenic 
signalling through �-arrestin-Src-ERK67.  
 
To further explore the functional properties of the genome that contribute to ER-
negative breast cancer heritability, we conducted a partitioned heritability analysis 
using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression68. Considering 52 “baseline” 
 genomic features, we observed the greatest enrichment for super-enhancers (2.5-
fold, p=2x10-7) and the H3K4me3 histone mark (2.4-fold, p=0.0005), with 33% 
depletion (p=0.0002) observed for repressed regions (Supplementary Table 15). No 
differences in enrichment for these features were observed between susceptibility to 
ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancer, but baseline genomic features are not 
specific to cell type68. The estimated correlation between ER-negative and ER-
positive breast cancer based on ~1M common genetic variants69,70 was 0.60 
(standard error [SE], 0.03) indicating that, although these two breast cancer 
subtypes have a shared genetic component, a substantial proportion is distinct. The 
estimated correlation between ER-negative disease in the general population and 
overall breast cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers was 0.72 (SE, 0.11). 
 
In summary, in this study of women of European origin, we have identified 10 novel 
susceptibility variants for ER-negative breast cancer and replicated associations with 
ER-negative disease for 10 SNPs identified by previous GWASs. Most of these were 
not associated, or more weakly associated, with ER-positive disease, consistent with 
the findings from pathway and partitioned heritability analyses showing that ER-
negative breast cancer has a partly distinct genetic aetiology. We also observed 
consistent associations with ER-negative disease for a further 105 overall breast 
cancer susceptibility SNPs. Together, these 125 variants explain ~14% of an 
assumed 2-fold increased risk of developing ER-negative disease for the first degree 
female relatives of women affected with this subtype (the newly identified SNPs 
explain ~1.5%); Supplementary Table 16) and ~40% of the estimated familial risk 
that is attributable to all variants imputable from the Oncoarray (see Online 
Methods). We have also identified nine novel breast cancer susceptibility variants for 
BRCA1 mutation carriers and confirmed associations for a further 30 previously 
reported SNPs; these 39 variants explain ~8% of the variance in polygenic risk for 
carriers of these mutations (Supplementary Table 17). However, the lower number of 
BRCA1 risk-associated variants may merely be a consequence of the smaller 
sample size, since the genetic correlation with ER-negative breast cancer is high. 
These findings will likely inform improved risk prediction, both for the general 
population and for BRCA1 mutation carriers30,71,72. Further investigation is required 
for other populations of non-European origin. Fine-mapping and functional studies 
should lead to a better understanding of the biological basis of ER-negative breast 
cancer, and perhaps inform the design of more effective preventive interventions, 
early detection and treatments for this disease.

variants, 11_108345515_G_A (rs11374964) and 11_108357137_G_A 
(rs74911261). One Mb region showing statistical significance of all genotyped and 
imputed SNPs and positions of candidate causal variants for two independent 
signals (shown below as red or blue ticks) in relation to RefSeq genes. Missense 
variants are labelled with asterisks. Breast cell enhancers overlapping candidate 
SNPs predicted to target nearby genes by IM-PET46 are depicted as black bars. 
Chromatin interactions from ENCODE ChIA-PET in MCF7 cells overlapping 
candidate variants are shaded to reflect interaction confidence scores. Epigenomic 
features (derived from publicly available ChIP-seq and DNase-seq) that overlap 
candidate variants are shown as red or blue segments, depending on the intersected 
signal. Density tracks show the summed occurrence of ChIP-seq and DNase-seq 
peak signals at each position. Roadmap Epigenomics Project chromatin state 
models for HMEC and myoepithelial cells grouped into enhancer, promoter or 
transcribed annotations are shown as yellow, red or green segments, respectively. 
Transcript levels in MCF7 and HMEC cells are represented by histograms depicting 
mean normalised RNA-seq expression. All MCF7 ChIA-PET (ENCODE) and HMEC 
Hi-C47 chromatin interactions are represented by black and blue arcs, respectively. 
NHGRI catalog GWAS SNPs are shown as green ticks. All Oncoarray SNPs 
(genotyped or imputed) are shown as black ticks and uninterrogated, common SNPs 
(dbSNP138, EUR MAF > 1%) as red ticks. Features may be examined in detail via 
exploration of a custom UCSC Genome Browser session accessible via hyperlinks

 Online Methods 
 
Study subjects 
Supplementary Table 1 summarises the studies from the Breast Cancer Association 
Consortium (BCAC) that contributed data. The majority were case-control studies. 
Sixty-eight BCAC studies participated in the ER-negative breast cancer component 
of the OncoArray, contributing 9,655 cases and 45,494 controls. All studies provided 
core data on disease status and age at diagnosis/observation, and the majority 
provided information on clinico-pathological and lifestyle factors, which have been 
curated and incorporated into the BCAC database (version 6). Estrogen receptor 
status for most (~70%) cases was obtained from clinical records. After removal of 
overlapping participants, genotype data were also available from eight 
GWASs9,12,16,37,38 (4,480 ER-negative cases and 12,632 controls) and 40 studies 
previously genotyped using the Illumina iCOGS custom array20 (7,333 ER-negative 
cases and 42,468 controls).  
 
A total of 21,468 ER-negative cases were included in the combined analyses.  Of 
those 5,793 had tumours that were also negative for progesterone receptor (PR) and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and were defined as triple-
negative (TN). PR and HER2 status was also obtained predominantly from clinical 
records. A further 4,217 were positive for PR or HER and were considered non-TN. 
The remainder had unknown PR or HER status. All participating studies were 
approved by their appropriate ethics review boards and all subjects provided 
informed consent.  
 
Subjects included from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 
(CIMBA) were women of European ancestry aged 18 years or older with a 
pathogenic variant in BRCA1. The majority of the participants were sampled through 
cancer genetics clinics. Multiple members of the same families were included in 
some instances. Fifty-eight studies from 24 countries contributed Oncoarray 
genotype data. After quality control (see below) and removal of overlapping 
participants with the BCAC OncoArray study, data were available on 15,566 BRCA1 
mutation carriers, of whom 7,784 were affected with breast cancer (Supplementary 
Table 2). We also obtained iCOGS genotype data on 3,342 BRCA1 mutation carriers 
(1,630 with breast cancer) from 54 studies through CIMBA. All mutation carriers 
provided written informed consent and participated under ethically approved 
protocols. 
 
OncoArray SNP selection 
Approximately 50% of the SNPs for the OncoArray were selected as a “GWAS 
backbone” (Illumina HumanCore), which aimed to provide high coverage for the 
majority of common variants through imputation. The remaining allocation was 
selected from lists supplied by each of six disease-based consortia, together with a 
seventh lists of SNPs of interest to multiple disease groups. Approximately 72k 
SNPs were selected specifically for their relevance to breast cancer, based on prior 
evidence of association with overall or subtype-specific disease, with breast density 
or with breast tissue specific gene expression. Lists were merged, as described 
previously34.  
 
Genotype calling and quality control 
 Details of the genotype calling and quality control (QC) for the iCOGS and GWAS 
are described elsewhere19,20,23,30, and those for OncoArray are described in the 
Supplementary Note. 
 
Imputation 
Genotypes for ~21M SNPs were imputed for all samples using the October 2014 
(Phase 3) release of the 1000 Genomes Project data as the reference panel and 
Nhap=800. The iCOGS, OncoArray and six of the GWAS datasets were imputed 
using a two-stage imputation approach, using SHAPEIT73 for phasing and 
IMPUTEv274 for imputation. The imputation was performed in 5Mb non-overlapping 
intervals. All subjects were split into subsets of ~10,000 samples, with subjects from 
the same grouped in the subset. The Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium 
(BPC3) and Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) GWAS performed the imputation 
separately using MACH and Minimac75,76. We imputed genotypes for all SNPs that 
were polymorphic (MAF>0.1%) in either European or Asian samples. For the BCAC 
GWAS, data were included in the analysis for all SNPs with MAF>0.01 and 
imputation r2>0.3. For iCOGS and OncoArray we included data for all SNPs with 
imputation r2>0.3 and MAF>0.005.  
 
Statistical analyses of BCAC data 
Per-allele odds ratios and standard errors were generated for the Oncoarray, iCOGS 
and each GWAS, adjusting for principal components using logistic regression. The 
Oncorray and iCOGS analyses were additionally adjusted for country and study, 
respectively. For the OncoArray dataset, principal components analysis was 
performed using data for 33,661 SNPs (which included the 2,318 markers of 
continental ancestry) with a MAF≥0.05 and maximum correlation of 0.1, using 
purpose-written software (PCcalc; see URLs section) to allow standard calculations 
to be performed sufficiently rapidly on a very large dataset. We used the first 10 
principal components, as additional components did not further reduce inflation in the 
test statistics. We used nine principal components for the iCOGS and up to 10 
principal components for the other GWAS, where this was found to reduce inflation. 
 
OR estimates were derived using MACH for the BCFR GWAS, ProbABEL77 for the 
BPC3 GWAS, SNPTEST (see URLs section) for the remaining GWAS and purpose 
written software for the iCOGS and Oncoarray datasets. OR estimates and standard 
errors were combined by a fixed effects inverse variance meta-analysis using 
METAL39. This was first done across the eight GWAS, applying genomic control, as 
described previously20. It was then applied (without genomic control) to combine 
findings from the three BCAC genotyping initiatives (GWAS, iCOGS, OncoArray).  
 
The independence of signals from two variants at 11q22.3 was by fitting the logistic 
regression models described above with both variants as covariates. This was done 
separately for iCOGS and OncoArray data and results for each variant combined by 
meta-analysis. 
 
For selected SNPs we estimated per-allele ORs by ER-status using all available 
BCAC data for 82,263 cases with known ER status and 87,962 controls from the 
iCOGS and OncoArray studies. We also estimated the per-allele ORs by TN status 
(TN versus other ER-negative subtypes) and tumour grade, using available BCAC 
data for ER-negative cases and corresponding controls. Tests for heterogeneity by 
 subtype were derived by applying logistic regression to cases only. This was done 
separately for the iCOGS and Oncoarray datasets, adjusted as before, and then 
combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Multinomial regression was applied to 
cases only to test a linear trend for grade, with the model constrained so that the 
difference between grade 1 and 3 was double that for the difference between grade 
2 and 3; this method was also used to test for a linear trend with age with ordinal 
values 1, 2, 3 and 4 representing ages <40, 40-49, 50-59 and ≥60, respectively. 
 
Statistical analyses of CIMBA data 
Associations between genotypes and breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers 
were evaluated using a 1df per allele trend-test (P-trend), based on modeling the 
retrospective likelihood of the observed genotypes conditional on breast cancer 
phenotypes36. This was done separately for iCOGS and OncoArray data. To allow 
for the non-independence among related individuals, an adjusted test statistic was 
used which took into account the correlation in genotypes3. All analyses were 
stratified by country of residence and, for countries where strata were sufficiently 
large (USA and Canada), by Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.  The results from the 
iCOGS and OncoArray datasets were then pooled using fixed effects meta-analysis. 
We repeated these analyses modelling ovarian cancer as a competing risk and 
observed no substantial difference in the results obtained.  
 
The independence of signals from two variants at 11q22.3 was assessed using 
OncoArray data only, fitting a Cox regression model with per-allele effects for both 
variants, adjusting for birth cohort, stratified by country of residence and using robust 
standard errors and clustered observations for relatives. This approach provides 
valid significance tests of associations, although the HR estimates can be biased35.  
 
Meta-analysis of BCAC and CIMBA 
A fixed effects meta-analysis of results from BCAC and CIMBA was conducted using 
an inverse variance approach assuming fixed effects, as implemented in METAL39. 
The effect estimates used were the logarithm of the per-allele hazard ratio (HR) 
estimate for the association with breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers from 
CIMBA and the logarithm of the per-allele OR estimate for the association with risk of 
ER-negative breast cancer based on BCAC data, both of which were assumed to 
approximate the same relative risk. We assessed genomic inflation using common 
(MAF>1%) GWAS backbone variants. As lambda is influenced by sample size, we 
calculated lambda1000 to be comparable with other studies. 
 
All statistical tests conducted were two-sided. 
 
Definition of known hits 
We identified all associations previously reported from genome-wide or candidate 
analysis at a significance level P<5x10-8 for overall breast cancer, ER-negative or 
ER-positive breast cancer, in BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers, or in meta-analyses of 
these categories. We included only one SNP in any 500kb interval, unless joint 
analysis provided genome-wide significant evidence (conditional P<5x10-8) of more 
than one independent signal. Where multiple studies reported associations in the 
same region, we considered the first reported association unless a later study 
identified a different variant in the same region that was more strongly associated 
with breast cancer risk. One hundred and seven previously reported hits were 
 identified, 11 of these through GWAS of ER-negative disease or of breast cancer in 
BRCA1 mutation carriers, or reported as more strongly associated with ER-negative 
breast cancer. These are listed in Table 2. The other 96 previously reported hits are 
listed in Supplementary Table 10. 
 
Definition of new hits 
To search for novel loci, we assessed all SNPs excluding those within 500kb of a 
known hit. This identified 206 SNPs in nine regions that were associated with 
disease risk at P<5x10-8 in the meta-analysis of BCAC ER-negative breast cancer 
and CIMBA BRCA1 mutation carriers. The SNP with lowest p-value from this 
analysis was considered the lead SNP. No additional loci were detected from the 
analysis of BCAC data only. Imputation quality, as assessed by the IMPUTE2 
imputation r2 in the Oncoarray dataset, was ≥0.89 for the 10 lead SNPs reported 
(Supplementary Table 3).  
 
Candidate causal SNPs 
To define the set of potentially causal variants at each of the novel susceptibility loci, 
we selected all variants with p-values within two orders of magnitude of the most 
significant SNP at each of the 10 novel loci. This is approximately equivalent to 
selecting variants whose posterior probability of causality is within two orders of 
magnitude of the most significant SNP40,41. This approach was applied to identify 
potentially causal variants for the signal given by the more frequent lead SNP at 
11q22.3 (rs11374964). A similar approach was applied for the rarer lead SNP at this 
locus (rs74911261), but based on p-values from analyses adjusted for rs11374964. 
 
Proportion of familial risk explained 
The relative risk of ER-negative breast cancer for the first degree female relative of a 
woman with ER-negative disease has not been estimated. We therefore assumed 
that the 2-fold risk observed for overall disease also applied to ER-negative disease. 
In order to estimate the proportion of this explained by the 125 variants associated 
with ER-negative disease, we used minor allele frequency and OR estimates from 
the OncoArray-based genotype data and applied the formula: 
� ���� � ��
�
����
� � ��
�� ln⁡
���

In Silico Annotation of Candidate Causal variants  
We combined multiple sources of in silico functional annotation from public 
databases to help identify potential functional SNPs and target genes, based on 
previous observations that breast cancer susceptibility alleles are enriched in cis-
regulatory elements and alter transcriptional activity28,80-82.  The influence of 
candidate causal variants on transcription factor binding sites was determined 
using the ENCODE-Motifs resource43. To investigate functional elements enriched 
across the region encompassing the strongest candidate causal SNPs, we 
analysed chromatin biofeatures data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements 
(ENCODE) Project42, Roadmap Epigenomics Projects44 and other data obtained 
through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) namely: Chromatin State Segmentation by Hidden Markov Models 
(chromHMM), DNase I hypersensitive and histone modifications of epigenetic 
markers H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 in Human Mammary Epithelial (HMEC) and 
myoepithelial (MYO) cells, T47D and MCF7 breast cancer cells and transcription 
factor ChIP-seq in a range of breast cell lines (Supplementary Table 6). To identify 
the SNPs most likely to be functional we used RegulomeDB45, and to identify 
putative target genes, we examined potential functional chromatin interactions 
between distal and proximal regulatory transcription-factor binding sites and the 
promoters at the risk regions, using Hi-C data generated in HMECs47 and 
Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired End Tag (ChiA-PET) in MCF7 cells. This 
detects genome-wide interactions brought about by, or associated with, CCCTC-
binding factor (CTCF), DNA polymerase II (POL2), and Estrogen Receptor (ER), all 
involved in transcriptional regulation47. Annotation of putative cis-regulatory regions 
and predicted target genes used the Integrated Method for Predicting Enhancer 
Targets (IM-PET)46, the “Predicting Specific Tissue Interactions of Genes and 
Enhancers” (PreSTIGE) algorithm48, Hnisz51 and FANTOM49. Intersections 
between candidate causal variants and regulatory elements were identified using 
Galaxy, BedTools v2.24 and HaploReg v4.1, and visualised in the UCSC Genome 
Browser. Publically available eQTL databases including Gene-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx;50 version 6, multiple tissues) and Westra52 (blood), were queried for 
candidate causal variants. 
 
eQTL analyses 
Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses were performed using data from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer 
International Consortium (METABRIC) projects59,60. 
 
The TCGA eQTL analysis was based on 79 ER-negative breast tumors that had 
matched gene expression, copy number, and methylation profiles together with the 
corresponding germline genotypes available.  All 79 individuals were of European 
ancestry as ascertained using the genotype data and the Local Ancestry in adMixed 
Populations (LAMP) software package (LAMP estimate cut-off >95% European)83.  
Germline genotypes were imputed into the 1000 Genomes reference panel (October 
2014 release) using IMPUTE275,84.  Gene expression had been measured on the 
Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA-Seq platform (gene-level RSEM normalized counts85), 
copy number estimates were derived from the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 (somatic copy 
 number alteration minus germline copy number variation called using the GISTIC2 
algorithm86), and methylation beta values measured on the Illumina Infinium 
HumanMethylation450, as previously described59. Primary TCGA eQTL analysis 
focused on all potentially causal variants in the 10 new regions associated with 
breast cancer risk in the meta-analysis of ER-negative cases and controls from 
BCAC and BRCA1 mutation carriers from CIMBA.  We considered all genes located 
up to 1 Mb on either side of each of these variants.  The effects of tumor copy 
number and methylation on gene expression were first removed using a method 
described previously58, and eQTL analysis was performed by linear regression as 
implemented in the R package Matrix eQTL87. 
 
The METABRIC eQTL analysis was based on 135 normal breast tissue samples 
resected from breast cancer patients of European ancestry.  Germline genotyping for 
the METABRIC study was also done on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0, and ancestry 
estimation and imputation for this data set was conducted as described for TCGA.  
Gene expression in the METABRIC study had been measured using the Illumina 
HT12 microarray platform and we used probe-level estimates.  As for TCGA, we 
considered all genes in 10 regions using Matrix eQTL. 
 
We also performed additional eQTL analyses using the METABRIC data set for all 
variants within 1 Mb of L3MBTL3 and CDH2 and the expression of these specific 
genes. 
 
Global Genomic Enrichment Analyses 
We performed stratified LD score regression analyses68 for ER- breast cancer using 
the summary statistics based on the meta-analyses of OncoArray, GWAS, iCOGS 
and CIMBA. We used all SNPs in the 1000 Genomes Project phase 1 v3 release 
that had a minor allele frequency > 1% and an imputation quality score R2>0.3 in the 
OncoArray data. LD scores were calculated using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 
1 v3 EUR panel. Further details are provided in the Supplementary Note. 
 
We tested the differences in functional enrichment between ER-positive and ER-
negative subsets for individual features through a Wald test, using the regression 
coefficients and standard errors for the two subsets based on the models described 
above. Finally, we assessed the heritability due to genotyped and imputed SNPs70 
and estimated the genetic correlation between ER-positive and ER-negative breast 
cancer69. The genetic correlation analysis was restricted to the ~1M SNPs included 
in HapMap 3.  
 
Pathway Enrichment Analyses (see also the Supplementary Note) 
The pathway gene set database 
Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_January_19_2016_symbol.gmt 
(GeneSets; see URLs section)61, was used for all analyses. Pathway size was 
determined by the total number of genes in the pathway to which SNPs in the 
imputed GWAS dataset could be mapped. To provide more biologically meaningful 
results, and reduce false positives, only pathways that contained between 10 and 
200 genes were considered.   
 
SNPs were mapped to the nearest gene within 500kb; those that were further than 
500 kb away from any gene were excluded. Gene significance was calculated by 
 assigning the lowest p-value observed across all SNPs assigned to a gene63,64, 
based on the meta-analysis of BCAC and CIMBA data described above.  
 
The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)61 algorithm, as implemented in the 
GenGen package (see URLs section)62,63 was used to perform pathway analysis. 
Briefly, the algorithm calculates an enrichment score (ES) for each pathway based 
on a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic62. Pathways that have most of their 
genes at the top of the ranked list of genes obtain higher ES values. 
 
We defined an ES threshold (ES≥0.41) to yield a true-positive rate (TPR) of 0.20 and 
a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.14, with true-positive pathways defined as those 
observed with false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05 in a prior analysis carried out using 
the analytic approach defined above applied to iCOGS data for ER-negative disease.  
 
To visualize the pathway enrichment analysis results, an enrichment map was 
created using the Enrichment Map (EM) v 2.1.0 app61 in Cytoscape  v3.3088, 
applying an edge-weighted force directed layout. To measure the contribution of 
each gene to enriched pathways and annotate the map, we reran the pathway 
enrichment analysis multiple times, each time excluding one gene. A gene was 
considered to drive the enrichment if the ES dropped to zero or less (pathway 
enrichment driver) after it was excluded. Pathways were grouped in the map if they 
shared >70% of their genes or their enrichment was driven by a shared gene.
