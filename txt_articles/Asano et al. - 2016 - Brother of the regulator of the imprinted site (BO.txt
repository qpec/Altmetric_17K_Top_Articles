ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is a major cause of cancer death in females worldwide. Cervical 
cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)/cancer-initiating cells (CICs) are resistant to conventional 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and CSCs/CICs are thought to be responsible for 
recurrence. Eradication of CSCs/CICs is thus essential to cure cervical cancer. In this 
study, we isolated cervical CSCs/CICs by sphere culture, and we identified a cancer 
testis (CT) antigen, CTCFL/BORIS, that is expressed in cervical CSCs/CICs. BORIS 
has 23 mRNA isoform variants classified by 6 subfamilies (sfs), and they encode 
17 different BORIS peptides. BORIS sf1 and sf4 are expressed in both CSCs/CICs and 
non-CSCs/CICs, whereas BORIS sf6 is expressed only in CSCs/CICs. Overexpression 
of BORIS sf6 in cervical cancer cells increased sphere formation and tumor-initiating 
ability compared with those in control cells, whereas overexpression of BORIS sf1 
and BORIS sf4 resulted in only slight increases. Thus, BORIS sf6 is a cervical CSC/
CIC-specific subfamily and has a role in the maintenance of cervical CSCs/CICs. BORIS 
sf6 contains a specific c-terminal domain (C34), and we identified a human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA)-A2-restricted antigenic peptide, BORIS C34_24(9) encoded by BORIS 
sf6. A BORIS C34_24(9)-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clone showed cytotoxicity for 
BORIS sf6-overexpressing cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, the CTL clone significantly 
suppressed sphere formation of CaSki cells. Taken together, the results indicate that 
the CT antigen BORIS sf6 is specifically expressed in cervical CSCs/CICs, that BORIS 
sf6 has a role in the maintenance of CSCs/CICs, and that BORIS C34_24(9) peptide is 
a promising candidate for cervical CSC/CIC-targeting immunotherapy. 
INTRODUCTION
Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer and 
the fourth leading cause of cancer death in females worldwide, 
accounting for 529,800 new cases and 275,100 deaths among 
females in 2008 [1]. Cytology-based screening has decreased 
the number of cervical cancer cases and the number of deaths 
due to cervical cancer [2]. However, treatment of patients 
with locally advanced cervical cancer (Stage IIb, III and IVa) 
is difficult. Concurrent chemoradiatiotherapy (CCRT) with 
platinum agents shows a high response rate and is the standard 
treatment, but the tumor often relapses and the prognosis of 
patients with a recurrent tumor is extremely poor due to the 
limited treatment [3].
Cancer stem-like cells/cancer initiation cells 
(CSCs/CICs) are defined as a small subpopulation of 
 Oncotarget

heterogeneous tumor cells that can renew themselves 
and have high tumor initiation ability [4, 5]. In a solid 
tumor, CSCs/CICs were identified as CD44+CD24-/low 
cells isolated from human breast cancer for the first time 
in 2003 [6], and other studies revealed that CSCs/CICs are 
resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [7–10]. Cell 
cycle dormancy, expression of ABC transporters, low level 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and resistance to DNA 
damage have been reported as mechanisms of treatment 
resistance. In cervical cancer, it has been reported that 
CSCs/CICs were isolated from primary cancer or cell 
lines by the sphere formation assay or ALDFLUOR 
assay and that they showed high tumor initiation ability 
and resistance to chemotherapy agents [11–13]. Cervical 
CSCs/CICs have been isolated using the sphere forming 
assay and cell surface markers including CD44 [11] and 
CD49f [12], but potential molecular targets of cervical 
CSCs/CICs are still not known. 
Cancer immunotherapy is an attractive alternative 
approach to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 
Human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 and E7 are oncogenic 
viral proteins, and they are expressed in cervical cancer 
from the early stage through to late stage and are therefore 
attractive targets of immunotherapy. However, the results 
of clinical trials of therapeutic vaccination targeting E6/E7 
for advanced cervical cancer patients were not satisfactory 
[14, 15]. We previously reported that cytotoxic T cells could 
recognize CSCs/CICs isolated using the side population 
(SP) technique and inhibit the tumor initiation ability of 
colon CSCs/CICs [16]. Furthermore, we identified a novel 
cancer/testis antigen, DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily 
B, member 8 (DNAJB8), that is preferentially expressed 
in renal cell carcinoma and colon/rectum CSCs/CICs and 
has a role in the maintenance of CSCs/CICs [17, 18]. 
Importantly, Dnajb8 showed a strong anti-tumor effect in 
a mouse DNA vaccination model [17]. These observations 
indicate the potency of CSC/CIC-targeting immunotherapy 
[19, 20]; however, there are no known antigens for cervical 
CSC/CIC-targeting immunotherapy. 
In this study, we isolated cervical CSCs/CICs by 
sphere culture, and we screened for CSC/CIC-specific 
genes by using a cDNA microarray to identify cervical 
CSC/CIC-specific 
genes. 
CCCTC-binding 
factor-
like protein (CTCFL), also known as brother of the 
regulator of the imprinted site (BORIS), was found to be 
preferentially expressed in cervical CSCs/CICs rather in 
non-CSCs/CICs, and immunological aspects of BORIS 
were investigated. 
RESULTS 
Spheres derived from cervical cancer cells 
exhibit a cancer stem-like cell phenotype
Cervical CSCs/CICs were successfully isolated by 
sphere culture and ALDEFLUOR assay in previous studies 
[12, 13]. In this study, we thus cultured cervical cancer line 
cells CaSki (Figure 1A) and TC-S in a serum-free sphere-
forming condition to isolate cervical CSCs/CICs. CaSki 
and TC-S cells successfully formed spheres (Figure 1B). 
Sphere-forming cells derived from CaSki cells and TC-S 
cells showed resistance to radiation and carboplatin 
(CBDCA) by the WST-1 assay (Figure 1C and 1D). 
Sphere-forming cells derived from CaSki cells and TC-S 
cells showed a quiescent cell cycle status compared with 
cells cultured in serum-containing medium (Figure 1E). 
Furthermore, sphere-forming cells showed higher 
expression levels of stem cell-related genes including 
SOX2, NANOG, POU5F1 and KLF4 (Figure 1F). 
These results indicate that sphere-forming cells have 
characteristics of CSCs/CICs, and we used spheres as 
cervical CSCs/CICs in the following experiments. 
BORIS, a testis-related gene, is expressed in 
cervical CSCs/CICs, and BORIS expression is 
related to poorer prognosis of cervical cancer
To explore gene expression profiles of cervical 
CSCs/CICs, we performed cDNA microarray analysis 
using total RNAs derived from CaSki sphere-culture cells 
and CaSki serum-culture cells. Several genes showed 
higher expression in sphere-culture cells (Supplementary 
Table S1). Among candidate genes, we focused on CTCFL/
BORIS, which has been described as a cancer-testis (CT) 
antigen, since CTCFL/BORIS was preferentially expressed 
in side population cells derived from colon cancer cell line 
SW480. [29] BORIS showed specific expression in the 
testis among normal human organs by quantitative RT-
PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 2A). BORIS showed preferential 
expression in sphere-culture cells derived from cervical 
cancer line cells MS751, TC-S, CaSki ME180 and SKG3B 
rather than in serum-culture cells (Figure 2B). 
To address the expression of BORIS protein in 
cervical cancer tissues, we performed immunohisto-
chemical staining using an anti-BORIS antibody 
(n = 38). The clinicopathological status of each case is 
summarized in Table 1. BORIShigh expression correlated 
with older age (P = 0.008), but did not with parity, 
histological type, clinical stage and Initial treatment. 
Testis tissue was used as a positive control for BORIS 
staining (Figure 2C). The cases were classified into 
two groups, BORIShigh group, having a BORIS-positive 
rate of more than 50% (Figure 2D), and BORISlow 
group, having a BORIS-positive rate of less than 50% 
(Figure 2E). There were 12 BORIShigh cases and 26 
BORISlow cases. There was no significant correlation of 
expression levels of BORIS with age, parity, presence of 
keratinization, FIGO stage or initial treatment. Kaplan-
Meier survival estimates were performed according to 
immunohistochemistry-positive rates of BORIS. The log-
rank test revealed that BORIShigh is correlated with poorer 
prognosis with a significant difference in OS of patients

(P = 0.0212) (Figure 2F). The median survival times of 
patients in the BORIShigh group and BORISlow group were 
10.5 months and 48.0 months, respectively. The hazard 
ratio of BORIShigh cases was 2.407 (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 1.190–8.567).
BORIS subfamily 6 has a role in the 
maintenance of cervical CSCs/CICs
To address the functions of BORIS in cervical 
CSCs/CICs, we performed BORIS gene knockdown 
experiments using BORIS gene-specific siRNAs. Three 
different BORIS-specific siRNAs (siRNA #1, #2 and #3) 
could suppress the expression of BORIS by more than 
90% in CaSki cells (Figure 3A). BORIS gene knockdown 
significantly inhibited sphere formation of CaSki cells, 
indicating that BORIS has a role in the maintenance of 
CSCs/CICs (Figure 3B and 3C). However, spheres smaller 
than 100 µm were observed for siRNA #3-transfected 
CaSki cells (Figure 3C). 
A recent study showed that BORIS has 23 distinct 
mRNA variants generated from alternative splicing and 
that they encode 17 different BORIS peptides. These 
variants are classified into six distinct subfamilies 
(subfamily (sf) 1 through sf6) based on common 3’ 
sequences [30]. We thus designed BORIS sf-specific 
primer pairs and performed RT-PCR using sphere-
culture and serum-culture CaSki and MS751 cells 
and testis tissue to determine which sf is expressed in 
CSCs/CICs (Figure 3D). BORIS sf 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 
detected in serum-culture CaSki cells, and BORIS sf 
1, 2, 4 and 6 were detected in sphere-culture CaSki 
cells. BORIS sf4 was detected in serum-culture MS751 
cells, and BORIS sf1, 3 and 6 were detected in sphere-
culture MS751 cells. The BORIS expression pattern was 
different from that in the testis. As previously reported, 
BORIS variants are expressed in a different manner in 
each cell line [30, 31]. Our data indicated that sf1 and 
sf4 are expressed in both CSCs/CICs and non-CSCs/
CICs and that BORIS sf6 is specifically expressed in 
CSCs/CICs. 
To determine which sf has a role in the maintenance 
of CSCs/CICs, we created several BORIS gene constructs 
including BORIS variants B0 (sf1), B3 (sf4), B6 (sf6) and 
C7 (sf6). Each construct was transfected into CaSki and 
TC-S cells, and overexpressed sublines were established. 
BORIS variant overexpression was confirmed by RT-
PCR and qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure S1). A sphere 
formation assay revealed that TC-S cells in which BORIS 
variant B6 (sf6) was overexpressed had significantly 
higher sphere-forming ability than the abilities of mock 
and other sf-transfected cells (Figure 3E). CaSki cells with 
overexpression of BORIS B0 (sf1), B6 (sf6) and C7 (sf6) 
showed higher sphere forming ability than that of mock-
transfected cells (Figure 3E). Thus, BORIS B6 might 
commonly have a role in the maintenance of CSCs/CICs. 
Tumor-initiating ability in immune-deficient nude 
mice was addressed by using Mock, BORIS B0, BORIS 
B3, BORIS B6 and BORIS C7-overexpressed CaSki 
cells. CaSki/BORIS B6 cells formed significantly larger 
tumors than tumors derived from other cells (Figure 3F). 
Furthermore, initiation of tumor formation was observed 
in 6 of 6 mice (injection of 103 cells), 4 of 6 mice (injection 
of 102 cells) and 0 of 6 mice (injection of 10 cells) in 
which xenotransplantation of CaSki/BORIS B6 cells was 
performed, whereas initiation of tumor formation was 
observed in only 1 of 6 mice (injection of 103 cells) and 1 
of 6 mice (injection of 102 cell) and 0 of 6 mice (injection 
of 10 cells) in which xenotransplantation of CaSki/mock 
cells was performed (Figure 3G). Estimated cancer stem 
cell frequency of CaSki/BORIS B6 cells was 1 in 108 by 
ELDA [25], and this is the highest CSC/CIC frequency 
among subfamily transfectants (Figure 3G). 
To confirm the BORIS sf6 in tumor samples, RT-
PCR using total RNAs isolated from cervical cancer FFPE 
samples were performed. BORIShigh cases (Pt1 – Pt12) 
were used. BORIS sf6 transctipts were detectable in 8 of 
12 cases (Figure 2G) indicating that BORIS sf6 transcrits 
were expressed in human cervical cancer tissues. 
BORIS sf6-targeting immunotherapy can 
recognize cervical CSCs/CICs
Since BORIS sf6 (B6) has a role in the maintenance 
of cervical CSCs/CICs, BORIS B6 might be a suitable 
and reasonable target for cervical CSC/CIC-specific 
immunotherapy. Most of the amino acid sequence of 
BORIS B6 is shared with other BORIS variants; however, 
the C34 domain is unique for BORIS sf6 (B6) (Figure 4). 
We thus screened for potential antigenic peptides coded 
in the C34 domain, and we found two candidate antigenic 
peptides (BORIS C34_24(9) and BORIS C34_23(10)) 
that carry an HLA-A2-binding motif (Figure 4). A peptide 
binding assay revealed that BORIS C34_24(9) peptide 
has high binding affinity to HLA-A2, whereas BORIS 
C34_23(10) peptide has low binding affinity (Figure 5A). 
Thus, BORIS C34_24(9) peptide was used for further 
analysis. 
To address the immunogenicity of BORIS 
C34_24(9) peptide, peptide-specific CTLs were induced 
using three HLA-A*0201+ healthy volunteer donors 
(donors A, B, and C) and one HLA-A*0206+ donor 
(donor D). PBMCs of four healthy volunteer donors were 
stimulated using BORIS C34_24(9) peptide and then the 
reactivity for the peptide was evaluated using an IFN-γ 
ELISpot assay and tetramer assay. BORIS C34_24(9)-
specific interferon-γ spots were observed for CD8+ T 
cells from donors A, B and C but not for CD8+ T cells 
from donor D by the ELISPOT assay (Figure 5B). A PE-
conjugated BORIS C34_24(9) peptide/HLA-A*0201 
tetramer-positive population was observed for CD8+ 
T cells from donor A and donor B, and the positive rates

were 0.6% and 9.4%, respectively (Figure 5C). PBMCs of 
donor C could not be analyzed by the tetramer assay due 
to the small number of cells. 
To further analyze BORIS C34_24(9) peptide-
specific CTLs, we established BORIS C34_24(9) peptide-
specific CTL clones by sorting of tetramer-positive T cells 
and limiting dilution methods. We successfully generated 
8 CTL clones specific for BORIS C34_24(9) peptide from 
donor A and 6 clones from donor B. BORIS C34_24(9) 
peptide-specificities of CTL clones were confirmed by the 
tetramer assay and ELIPOT assay (Figure 5D and 5E). 
BORIS C34_24(9) peptide-negative clones were obtained 
by only limiting dilution. The cell growth of CTL clone 
E1 was better than that of other clones, and we thus 
used the E1 clone for further analysis. An LDH release 
cytotoxicity assay revealed that the E1 clone showed 
specific cytotoxicity for BORIS C34_24(9) peptide-pulsed 
T2 cells compared with cytotoxicity for control peptide-
pulsed T2 cells, T2 cells and K562 cells (Figure 5F). 
To determine whether the BORIS C34_24(9)-specific 
CTL clone can recognize endogenously presented BORIS 
C34_24(9) peptide of BORIS sf6-positive cancer cells, 
we performed an LDH release assay using BORIS B6/
CaSki and CaSki cells. The E1 clone showed significantly 
higher cytotoxicity for CaSki cells than for K562 negative 
control cells. The E1 clone also showed significantly 
higher cytotoxicity for CaSki/BORIS B6 cells than for 
CaSki cells (Figure 5F). The cytotoxicities for CaSki 
cells and CaSki/BORIS B6 cells were significantly 
inhibited by HLA class I antibody (W6/32) (Figure 5G). 
The results indicate that BORIS C34_24(9) peptide is an 
immunogenic epitope and that the endogenously processed 
peptide is presented on the surface of CaSki cells. 
Finally, we investigated whether BORIS C34_24(9)-
specific CTLs suppress the sphere forming ability of 
cervical CSCs/CICs. Five thousand CaSki cells were co-
cultured with 5 × 104 cells of the E1 clone or negative 
clone for 7 days in a 96-well ultra low attachment plate.

The E1 clone significantly suppressed sphere formation of 
CaSki cells compared with the negative clone (Figure 5H 
and 5I). Furthermore, CTL clone E1 significantly 
suppressed the tumor growth in vivo (Figure 5J). The 
results indicate that the BORIS C34_24(9) peptide-specific 
CTL clone can recognize cervical CSCs/CICs. 
DISCUSSION
In this study, we isolated cervical CSCs/CICs by 
sphere culture. Previous studies showed that cervical 
CSCs/CICs can be isolated by sphere culture and that 
ALDHhigh cells can be isolated by the ALDEFLUOR assay 
[12, 13]. The cells forming spheres showed a dormant cell 
cycle status, resistance to radiothepray and chemotherapy, 
and higher expression levels of stem cell-related genes. 
These results indicate that spheres and ALDHhigh cells are 
proper sources of cervical CSCs/CICs. 
We identified BORIS as a cervical CSC/CIC-related 
gene. BORIS shares an 11 zinc-finger domain with its 
paralogue CTCF, and it has a role as an epigenetic factor 
including chromatin remodeling via histone modifications 
[32–34] and germline imprinted gene methylation [35]. 
CTCF is an insulator and tumor suppressor gene, whereas 
BORIS exhibits oncogenetic properties including an anti-
apoptotic ability via upregulation of the human Telomerase 
Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT) gene in embryonic and 
ovarian tumor cells [36]. High expression level of BORIS 
determined by immunohistochemistry and high BORIS/
CTCF mRNA ratio are related to poorer prognosis for 
patients with esophageal cancer and epithelial ovarian 
cancer, respectively [37, 38]. In this study, we showed 
that a high BORIS protein expression level determined 
by immunohistochemistry is related to poorer prognosis 
for patients with FIGO stage III/IV cervical cancer. 
These observations indicate that a high level of BORIS 
expression might be a novel prognostic marker for 
cancers. Alberti et al. isolated 3–5% of BORIS-positive 
cells from an embryonic cancer cell line using a BORIS 
mRNA-targeting molecular beacon. BORIS-positive cells 
expressed cancer stem genes including CD44, ALDH1, 
NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 [39]. We previously reported 
that BORIS is preferentially expressed in CSCs/CICs 
isolated as SP cells of colon cancer [29]. We confirmed 
BORIS expression in cervical CSCs/CICs by qRT-PCR 
in the present study. Monk et al. showed that BORIS is

also expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and that it 
is co-localized with OCT4 and NANOG [40]. These 
observations indicate that BORIS is related to CSCs/CICs 
and might associate with stem cell-related transcription 
factors including OCT4 and NANOG. 
In this study, we performed RT-PCR to investigate 
the expression pattern of BORIS classified by 
 
6 subfamilies in CSCs/CICs. Original BORIS (B0) has 
an 11 zinc-finger domain, N258 domain and C95 domain. 
BORIS isoproteins have various numbers of zinc finger 
domains and a distinct N-terminus domain and c-terminus 
domain. Among the BORIS subfamilies, BORIS sf6, 
which has only 4 or 5 zinc-finger domains and a distinct 
C34 domain, is more specifically expressed in CSCs/CICs. 
 
Moreover, the sphere formation assay and tumor xenograft 
model in BALB/C nude mice revealed that BORIS variant 
B6 (sf6) is involved in the maintenance and high tumor 
initiating ability of CSCs/CICs. The function of each 
BORIS variant is still elusive; however, Pugacheva et 
al. reported that DNA binding efficiency of BORIS 
isoproteins depends on the number of zinc-finger domains. 
They demonstrated by using an electrophoresis mobility 
shift assay (EMSA) that H19 imprinting control region 
(ICR), which is a common binding resion of CTCF and 
BORIS, was required to bind BORIS isoproteins with 
at least nine zinc fingers, while only five zinc fingers 
were required for binding the promoter of the mouse 
cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) gene. Furthermore, 
they showed that the N258 amino terminus of BORIS 
isoproteins in common is required to activate the CST 
promoter [30]. Their findings and our findings indicate 
that each BORIS isoprotein has a distinct gene regulatory 
network modulating different gene transcription or 
competing with another variant or CTCF and that BORIS 
variant B6 might be specifically related to gene expression 
of cancer stemness. 
BORIS is promising as an immunotherapeutic 
target because of its exclusive expression pattern in 
normal organs and its oncogenetic properties. Aberrant 
expression of BORIS has been reported in various primary 
cancers including glioblasma [41], melanomas [42], head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma [43], esophageal 
cancer [37], breast cancer [44, 45], prostate cancer [46], 
uterine corpus cancer [47, 48] and ovarian cancer [49] at 
mRNA or protein levels. Thus, immunotherapy targeting 
BORIS might be beneficial for diverse cancer patients. 
The potency of BORIS for immunotherapy was adverted 
with a mouse model in previous studies. Previous studies 
showed that a plasmid encoding a mutated murine BORIS 
(pmBORIS) DNA vaccine could induce murine CD8+ 
and CD4+ T lymphocyte responses and exhibited an anti-
cancer effect [50, 51]. However, there is no report in 
which the T cell immune response for human BORIS is 
described. In this report, we describe the identification of a 
CTL epitope encoded by BORIS protein for the first time. 
BORIS C34_24(9) peptide is coded in the C34 domain of 
CSC/CIC-specific BORIS variant sf6. BORIS C34_24(9) 
peptide-specific CTL clone E1 recognized BORIS B6-
overexpressing cells, indicating that BORIS C34_24(9) 
peptide is endogenously expressed and presented by 
HLA-A2. Importantly, the CTL clone E1 suppressed the 
sphere formation ability of CaSki cells, indicating that 
BORIS C34_24(9)-specific CTLs can kill CBDCA and 
radiotherapy-resistant sphere cells. Therefore, cancer 
immunotherapy using BORIS C34_24(9) peptide might 
be a promising approach to treat chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy-resistant cervical cancers. 
In conclusion, we demonstrated that cervical 
cancer spheres showed characteristics of CSCs/CICs and 
that BORIS sf6 is involved in cervical cancer stemness. 
BORIS C34_24(9) peptide encoded by BORIS sf6 is 
a candidate antigenic peptide for cervical CSC/CIC-
targeting immunotherapy.

was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium 
(DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10 mg/mL 
 
blasticidin and 1 mg/mL puromycin. Cells were incubated 
in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.
Sphere culture
Sphere culture was performed as described 
previously. [23] Briefly, 103 cells were plated, and the 
number of spheres in an area of 100 µm in diameter 
was counted on day 14. The sphere culture medium was 
serum-free DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies) supplemented 
with N-2 supplement (Wako, Osaka, Japan), 20 mg/ml 
recombinant human epithelial growth factor, 10 mg/ml 
human basic fibroblast growth factor (R & D Systems), 
4 µg/ml heparin (AY pharma, Tokyo, JAPAN) and 1% 
penicillin and streptomycin. 
Radioresistance and chemoresistance assay
The effects of radiation and a chemotherapy agent 
on cell viability of spheres and serum-cultured cells were 
evaluated with the WST-1 assay. One thousand CaSki 
and TC-S cells were plated in a 96-well plate with 100 µl 
serum culture medium as serum-cultured cells, and ten 
thousand of CaSki and TC-S cells were plated in an 
ultra-low attachment 96-well plate (Corning) with sphere 
culture medium as sphere cultured-cells. After 72 hours 
of preculture, cells were treated by irradiation (5 Gy or 10 
Gy) or by chemotherapy (10, 50, 100 and 500 µg/ml of 
CBDCA). Seventy-two hours after treatments, relative cell 
viability was analyzed using the WST-1 Cell Proliferation 
Assay System (Wako, Osaka, Japan) according to the 
instructions of the manufacturer. 
Cell cycle assay
Adherent cultured cells were enzymatically 
dissociated by incubation in a trypsin-EDTA solution 
at 37°C, and spheres were mechanically dissociated 
by pipetting. Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and 
resuspended in PBS containing 250 µg/ml RNase A 
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 37°C, followed by 
staining with 50 µg/ml propidium iodide for 10 minutes 
at 4°C in the dark. Stained cells were filtered into a 
conical tube with a 35 µm nylon filter and analyzed with a 
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and 
Mod-Fit cell cycle analysis program. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
Immunohistochemical staining of BORIS was 
performed as described previously [24] using formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of biopsy specimens 
from 38 patients with International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III or IV of 
untreated cervical squamous cell carcinoma. All patients 
received initial treatment at Sapporo Medical University 
Hospital during the period from 2001 to 2011. A rabbit 
anti-BORIS polyclonal antibody (HPA001472, Sigma-
Aldrich) was used at a 1:100 dilution. For evaluation of 
BORIS staining, the cases were divided into two groups 
(BORIShigh group and BORISlow group) by a cut line of 
50% of positive rates.
Total RNA isolation and microarray preparation
Total RNA was isolated from collected cells 
using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) 
following the manufacturer’s protocol. We used the 
commercially available Low Input Quick Amp Labeling 
Kit (Agilent Technologies). Purified total RNA (3 µg) 
was reverse-transcribed to generate double-stranded 
cDNA using an oligo dT T7 promoter primer and reverse 
transcriptase. Then cRNA was synthesized using T7 RNA 
polymerase, which simultaneously incorporated Cy3- or 
Cy5-labeled cytidine triphosphate. During this process, the 
samples of sphere cells were labeled with Cy5, whereas the 
adherent cultured cells were labeled with Cy3 as control 
cells. The quality of cRNA was again checked using 
Nano Drop. Cy3-labeled cRNA and Cy5-labeled cRNA 
were combined and then fragmented in a gene expression 
hybridization kit (Agilent Technologies). Then the labeled 
cRNAs were hybridized to a 60-mer probe oligonucleotide 
microarray (G4845A human GE 4x44K V2 Microarray kit) 
 
and incubated for 20 hours at 50°C. The fluorescent 
intensities were determined by an Agilent Technologies 
Scanner G2505C. Samples of sphere cells were labeled 
with Cy3, whereas adherent cultured cells were labeled 
with Cy5. Microarray raw data and processed data have 
been deposited in the NCBI GEO database (GSE65499).
Total RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE) samples were isolated using NucleoSpin totalRNA 
FFPE kit according to manufactures protocol (TaKaRa 
Bio., Kusatsu, JAPAN). BORIS IHC positive cases 
 
(Pt1–Pt12) were used. 
Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and 
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR were performed as described 
previously [23]. Human normal tissue panel (Human 
MTC panel I and Human MTC panel II, TaKaRa Bio. 
Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) were used. The primer sequences 
used for cDNA amplification are summerized in Table S1. 
Quantitative PCR was performed using a Stepone Real-
Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, 
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
SOX2 (Hs01053049_s1), POU5F1 (Hs00999632_g1), 
 
NANOG (Hs04260366_g1), KLF4(Hs00358836_m1), 
and CTCFL(Hs00966548_g1, which is specific for 
CTCFL(BORIS) variants including B0, B3, B6 and C7,

primers and probes were designed by the manufacturer 
(TaqMan Gene expression assays; Applied Biosystems). 
Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Expression 
of each gene was normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA. 
Fold change was determined by the ΔΔCt method. 
siRNA-mediated knockdown
BORIS siRNAs (SR315374; OriGene Technologies, 
Rockville, 
MD, 
USA) 
were 
transfected 
using 
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according 
to the protocol of the manufacturer. Cells were transfected 
with siRNA 48 hours before analysis. Universal scrambled 
siRNA (SR30004; Origene Technologies) was used as a 
negative control. BORIS knockdown was confirmed by 
qRT-PCR. 
Retroviral gene transduction and generation of 
stable transformants
Transduction of genes into cells was carried 
out using a retrovirus-mediated method as described 
previously [22]. cDNAs coding BORIS variants B0, B3, 
B6, C7 were cloned into the pMXs-puro retroviral vector 
(kind gift from Dr. T. Kitamura, Tokyo). 
Mouse xenograft assay and CTL adoptive 
transfer 
CaSki-transduced BORIS variants (CaSki/mock, 
CaSki/BORIS B0, CaSki/BORIS B3, CaSki/BORIS B6 and 
CaSki/BORIS C7) were suspended at 102, 103 and 104 cells 
in 100 µl PBS mixed with Matrigel (BD) at a 1:1 volume 
and injected subcutaneously into the backs of 4-week-
old female BALB/C nude mice. Tumor size was assessed 
weekly using a caliper and calculated using the following 
formula: tumor size (mm3) = (longest diameter × shortest 
diameter2)/2. Cancer stem cell frequency was calculated by 
web program Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA; 
http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/) software [25]. 
For CTL adoptive transfer, 104 of CasKi cells 
were injected NOD/SCID mice. On day 21 and day 28, 
107 of CTL clone E1 were suspended in 100 ul of PBS 
were injected intravenously. PBS was used as a negative 
control. The tumor growth were assed weekly. 
Synthetic peptides and peptide binding assay
Two peptides, BORIS C34_23(10) (KLLFIGTIKV) 
and BORIS C34_24(9) (LLFIGTIKV), were designed 
designed by BIMAS web site (http://www-bimas.cit.
nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind/). Peptide binding affinity 
to HLA-A2 was assessed using T2 cells as described 
previously. [26] A cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptide 
(NLVPMVATV; HLA-A*0201) and an influenza viral 
peptide (GILGFVFTL; HLA-A*0201) were used as 
positive controls, and GK12 (GYISPYFINTSK) was used 
as a negative control. 
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induction and 
interferon-γ ELISPOT assay
CTL induction was performed as described 
previously. [27] HLA-A2-positive PBMCs were isolated 
from four healthy volunteer donors (Donors A, B and C 
are HLA-A*0201-positive and donor D is HLA-A*0206-
positive.). An IFN-γ ELISPOT assay was performed 
as described previously. [28] Five × 104 CTLs were 
incubated with 5 × 104 T2 cells per well pulsed with each 
peptide (20 µg/mL). After incubation overnight at 37°C, 
IFN-γ spots were developed and assessed. 
Peptide-MHC tetramer assay and establishment 
of CTL clone 
BORIS C34_24(9) peptide/HLA-A2 tetramers 
were synthesized by MBL (Nagoya, Aichi, JAPAN). 
CTLs were stained by the tetramer at 4°C for 30 min at 
a 1:20 dilution and then stained for a further 20 min with 
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-
CD8 monoclonal antibody (1:20 dilution). Stained CTLs 
were analyzed with a FACSaria II (BD Biosciences) or 
a FACScalibur. To obtain CTL clones, tetramer-positive 
single cell sorting was performed with FACSaria II, 
and standard limiting dilution was done as described 
previously [28].
LDH release cytotoxicity assay
The antigen-specific lytic activity of CTL clones 
was evaluated using an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit 
(Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) following the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Target cells (10000 cells/well) were incubated 
with various numbers of effector cells for 7 hrs at 37°C 
in 96-well V-bottomed plates, and cytotoxicity was 
calculated using the culture supernatants. The percentage 
of specific lysis was calculated as [(experimental release 
− spontaneous release)/(maximum release − spontaneous 
release)] × 100. Cytotoxicity blocking assays were 
performed using monoclonal antibodies. Tumor targets 
were incubated with hybridoma culture supernatants 
of anti-HLA-class I antibody (W6/32) or anti-HLA-DR 
antibody (L243) for 1 hr at room temperature. 
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SE or SD. Fisher’s 
exact test or Student’s t-test was used to determine 
the significance of associations between characteristic 
valuables. Differences in variables were assessed 
using Student’s t test. Survival curves were constructed 
according to the Kaplan–Meier method, and differences

between groups were tested by the log-rank test. Statistical 
significance was determined by the log-rank test. 
P < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis 
was done with GraphPad Prism (version 4.0 for Windows; 
GrapgPad Software Inc).
