BACKGROUND: Care for infants born preterm or with major birth defects is costly. Specific 
estimates of financial burden for different payers are lacking, in part because use of 
administrative data to identify preterm infants and costs is challenging.
METHODS: We used private health insurance claims data and billing codes to identify live 
births during 2013 and calculated first-year expenditures for employer-sponsored health 
plans for infants born preterm, both overall and stratified by major birth defects.
RESULTS: We conservatively estimated that 7.7% of insured infants born preterm accounted 
for 37% of $2.0 billion spent by participating plans on the care of infants born during 2013. 
With a mean difference in plan expenditures of ∼$47 100 per infant, preterm births cost 
the included plans an extra $600 million during the first year of life. Extrapolating to the 
national level, we projected aggregate employer-sponsored plan expenditures of $6 billion 
for infants born preterm during 2013. Infants with major birth defects accounted for 
5.8% of preterm births but 24.5% of expenditures during infancy. By using an alternative 
algorithm to identify preterm infants, it was revealed that incremental expenditures were 
higher: $78 000 per preterm infant and $14 billion nationally.
CONCLUSION Preterm births (especially in conjunction with major birth defects) represent a 
substantial burden on payers, and efforts to mitigate this burden are needed. In addition, 
researchers need to conduct studies using linked vital records, birth defects surveillance, 
and administrative data to accurately and longitudinally assess per-infant costs 
attributable to preterm birth and the interaction of preterm birth with major birth defects.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: Preterm infants 
often incur high medical costs. Lifetime medical 
costs for US infants born preterm in 2005 were $17 
billion higher than for other infants. Birth defects 
were associated with $9 billion in hospital costs 
during infancy in 2013.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: Employer-sponsored 
health plans in the United States paid at least $6 
billion extra for infants born preterm during 2013, 
one-quarter of which was associated with the 6% of 
preterm infants who had major birth defects.

 Approximately 1 in 10 US infants 
are born preterm (<37 completed 
weeks’ gestation), 
1 with high costs 
of neonatal hospitalizations.2 
– 
4 Each 
year’s cohort of preterm births 
incurred an incremental lifetime 
societal cost of $26.2 billion in 2005 
dollars, including $16.9 billion 
in health care costs.5 In addition, 
the medical costs of prematurity 
to employers6 and Medicaid have 
also been assessed.7 Estimates of 
the added cost of preterm birth to 
employer-sponsored health plans can 
be used to demonstrate to employers 
the financial benefit of preterm birth 
prevention.
Our objectives with this analysis 
were (1) to estimate the financial 
impact on US employer-sponsored 
plans of medical care for infants born 
preterm during 2013 (both overall 
and among infants with and without 
major birth defects), and (2) review 
potential biases in estimates of per-
infant incremental expenditures for 
preterm versus nonpreterm births 
from analyses in which stand-alone 
claims data are used to ascertain 
preterm birth and estimate health 
care expenditures. Because infants 
with birth defects are more likely 
to be born preterm5, 
 
8 and have 
elevated use of health care, 
9, 
 
10 we 
excluded infants with malformations 
to provide a lower-bound estimate 
of the burden of preterm birth. 
Finally, although record linkage in 
studies in which researchers use vital 
records data are the gold standard 
for economic assessments of preterm 
birth, 
5 administrative databases 
are often used to estimate health 
care costs, and it is important to 
understand their limitations.
MethODs
Data source
We analyzed data from the Truven 
Health Analytics MarketScan 
Commercial Research Database, a 
nationwide sample of private health 
plans provided through employers 
with data for tens of millions of 
individuals with employer-sponsored 
insurance (ESI). We accessed 
MarketScan data via Treatment 
Pathways 4.0, an online analytic 
platform; our analysis was restricted 
to plans with prescription drug 
coverage, which include ∼75% of all 
MarketScan enrollees. This platform 
does not enable linkages between 
infant and maternal records.
Inclusion criteria
We used 2 distinct approaches to 
identify a cohort of newborn infants 
with a presumed birth hospitalization 
during the 2013 calendar year. One 
approach included all infants with 
both a diagnosis-related group (DRG) 
code of 789 to 795 in the principal 
diagnosis field for an inpatient 
admission and a diagnosis code of 
V30 to V39 to indicate a live birth 
associated with the same discharge; 
in addition, they had no claims or 
enrollment date before the first 
inpatient claim with a neonatal DRG. 
In the other approach, we excluded 
the 790 DRG code, which refers to 
“extreme immaturity or respiratory 
distress syndrome, neonate.” The 
justification for that exclusion is that 
infants with respiratory distress 
syndrome (RDS) may be enrolled in 
a covered plan after diagnosis rather 
than at birth. In both approaches, we 
tracked services and expenditures for 
12 months after the first claim.
Identifying Preterm Infants
To identify infants coded for preterm 
birth (gestational age <37 weeks), we 
used the presence of International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification  
(ICD-9-CM) codes 765.00 to 765.28 on 
the first neonatal hospital discharge. 
Those codes, together with others for 
term low birth weight (LBW) births, 
are used to bill for services relating to 
“disorders relating to short gestation 
and low birth weight” (Supplemental 
Table 3). All other newborns were 
presumed to be nonpreterm. In 
previous studies, researchers 
indicated that the above ICD-9-CM 
codes are highly specific, with a 
positive predictive value of at least 
90%.11, 
 
12 However, the sensitivity is 
much lower (between 45% and 80%) 
and is particularly low for infants 
born at 35 or 36 weeks’ gestation.12, 
 
13  
Consequently, only a subset of infants 
born preterm are coded as preterm.
By using a list of ICD-9-CM codes 
for selected major birth defects 
(Supplemental Table 4), infants who 
had 1 or more inpatient claims with 
any of the selected codes or ≥2 claims 
in any setting at least 7 days apart 
were classified as having a major birth 
defect. Billing codes for major birth 
defects in a single claim have a low 
positive predictive value (typically 
50% to 70%).11, 
 
14, 
 
15 We calculated 
incremental expenditures for preterm 
birth, both overall and excluding 
infants with major birth defects.
Outcomes and sensitivity analysis
We calculated net plan expenditures 
(reimbursements to providers by 
plans) during the first 12 months of life, 
regardless of duration of enrollment. 
We reported all expenditures and 
expenditures associated with inpatient 
services. In addition, we reported total 
allowable charges after adjudication 
by the health plan, which consists of 
2 parts: the plan payment and the 
expected out-of-pocket payment by 
beneficiaries.
As a sensitivity analysis, we 
restricted the primary analysis 
sample to infants with continuous 
enrollment for 12 months.
national estimates
The aggregate additional expenditures 
by US employers on infancy care 
associated with preterm birth during 
2013 were extrapolated from the study 
estimates by adjusting for the ratio of 
all births covered by ESI to the number 
of births in the data source. In 2013, 
private payers were responsible for 
1 808 809 of 3 899 668 hospitalizations 
with a neonatal DRG code (789–795)

 (Health Care Utilization Project, 
Agency for Healthcare Research and

aged <6 years with private health 
insurance had ESI coverage.17* Those 
estimates imply 1 746 901 neonatal 
admissions were covered nationally by 
ESI during 2013. We used the ratio of 
this number to the number of neonatal 
admissions in our analytic sample to 
extrapolate employer-sponsored plan 
expenditures to the national level.
Results
The number of infants with first 
neonatal hospitalizations during the 
2 approaches in 2013 were 180 787 
(with the 790 DRG code) and 173 649 
(excluding the 790 DRG code as an 
inclusion criterion). The number

of insured infants with preterm 
billing codes were 17 795 (9.8%) 
in the first approach and 13 426 
(7.7%) in the second approach. Of 
the 7138 infants who had a 790 
DRG code, virtually all (98%) also 
had an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for 
RDS. The percentage of infants with 
an inpatient diagnosis of RDS was 
4.4% of 180 787 infants in the first 
approach by using the 790 DRG code 
to ascertain neonates and 0.9% of 
the 173 649 infants in the second 
approach. The latter estimate is 
consistent with population-based 
neonatal RDS prevalence estimates of 
1.2%.18, 
 
19 Consequently, we treated 
the second approach as the primary 
analysis.
Per-Infant expenditures
By using the second approach, 
mean net plan expenditures for 
infants classified as preterm were 
$54 873 compared with $7774 
for nonpreterm infants, a mean 
difference of $47 099 (Table 1). 
Under the first approach, with an 
approximately fourfold higher 
RDS prevalence, mean net plan 
expenditures were $85 962 for 
preterm infants and $7942 for 
nonpreterm infants, a difference of 
$78 019 per infant (Table 1).
In a sensitivity analysis restricted to 
the 42% of infants with 12 months 
of continuous enrollment, per-child 
expenditures for the year were 
similar to those reported above 
(S.D.G., unpublished observations).
Mean inpatient expenditures 
accounted for 89% to 92% of overall 
net plan expenditures for preterm 
infants compared with 61% to 62% 
for nonpreterm infants (S.D.G., 
unpublished observations). Total 
mean allowable charges (ie, expected 
total payments to providers) per 
child were slightly higher than 
plan payments for infants coded as 
preterm (ie, expected out-of-pocket 
payments) by $1883 to $2158 in 
absolute terms and 2.5% to 3.4% in

 relative terms; for other infants, total 
costs were higher by $961 to $1354, 
or 12.4% to 17.0% in relative terms 
(Table 1).
As is generally the case with 
health care expenditures, median 
expenditures (the payment for the 
average child) were considerably 
lower than mean expenditures (the 
average payment for all children in 
the group). The median was closer 
to the mean for the nonpreterm 
group than for the preterm birth 
group, which reflects a more 
skewed distribution of costs in  
the latter.
aggregate Infant spending and 
attributable Preterm birth spending
The aggregate plan expenditures 
variable is the product of mean 
expenditures during the first 12 
months by the number of infants. 
For 173 649 infants in the second 
approach, aggregate expenditures 
were ∼$2.0 billion, of which ∼$740 
million (37.2%) were incurred by 
7.7% of infants coded as preterm 
(Table 1). In the first approach, 
aggregate expenditures for the 
cohort of 180 787 infants were ∼$2.9 
billion, of which ∼$1.5 billion (or 
54.2% of total infant expenditures) 
were incurred by the 9.8% of infants 
classified as preterm.
The number of hospital deliveries in 
this study was ∼10% of the 1 746 901 
deliveries covered nationally by ESI 
during 2013.
Aggregate expenditures during 
infancy attributable to preterm 
births in the second approach were 
∼$632.4 million (the product of the 
incremental expenditure for preterm 
infants [$47 099] and the number 
of infants coded as preterm [n = 
13 426]). The national estimate of 
aggregate spending by employer-
sponsored plans on medical care 
during infancy associated with 
preterm birth during 2013 was 
$6.3 billion in 2014 dollars in that 
approach. Aggregate preterm-
attributable expenditures according 
to the first approach were ∼$14 
billion.
Per-Infant expenditures associated 
With birth Defects
In the primary analysis (in which 
the second approach to identify 
newborns was used), infants with 
major birth defects comprised 
6.5% of infants coded as preterm 
compared with 2.3% of infants not 
coded as preterm. Mean expenditures 
for infants who did not meet the 
algorithm for confirmed major birth 
defects were 6.6 times higher for 
those born preterm: $42 620 vs 
$6450. The incremental expenditure 
associated with preterm birth among 
those without major birth defects 
was $36 171 (Table 2). The latter 
figure multiplied by the number of 
preterm infants without major birth 
defects (12 401) yields a lower-bound 
attributable expenditure for preterm 
birth among participating plans of 
$528.5 million, which is 16.5% lower 
than the primary estimate of $632.4 
million. The mean expenditures for 
preterm infants with major birth 
defects ($226 840) is 3.5 times 
greater than for infants with major 
birth defects not coded as born 
preterm ($63 939). Preterm infants 
with major birth defects accounted 
for 27.5% of all expenditures for 
preterm infants.
DIscussIOn
In this study, we confirm previous 
findings that preterm birth is costly 
to US private health plans and 
employers.5, 
 
6, 
 
20 The estimates in this 
study relate to plan expenditures. 
Average payments by private health 
plans substantially exceed those of 
public payers, including Medicare 
and Medicaid.21 Estimates of average 
per-child Medicaid expenditures 
for preterm and/or LBW infants 
born during 2009 were only one-
third as high as for infants in 
employer-sponsored plans.6, 
 
7 Unlike 
the authors of a 2006 Institute of 
Medicine (IOM) report, 
5 we did 
not include costs of pregnancy 
and delivery care or medical care 
after infancy, and therefore our 
medical cost estimates are partial. 
Furthermore, our estimates do 
not address societal costs, which 
include nonmedical services and 
lost economic production. Preterm 
birth is costly, and efforts to reduce 
its occurrence have large potential 
benefits.
We estimated an aggregate cost to 
US employer-sponsored plans of 
between $6 billion and $14 billion for 
infant care attributable to preterm 
birth during 2013. The difference 
between the 2 estimates reflects the 
differential inclusion of infants with a

 DRG code for RDS, representing 0.9% 
and 4.4% in the second and first 
approaches, respectively. Because 
the former estimate is consistent 
with population-based neonatal RDS 
prevalence estimates of 1.2%, 
18, 
 
19  
we believe that it is closer to a 
representative cohort of privately 
insured newborns enrolled from 
birth. Conversely, the second cohort 
might have been enriched with 
infants with RDS. Consequently, we 
suspect that the aggregate economic 
impact of preterm birth on employer-
sponsored health plans is likely to 
be much closer to the lower-bound 
estimate of $6 billion than the upper-
bound estimate of $14 billion.
Our lower-bound estimate of $6 
billion for the US employer insurance 
burden of preterm birth may appear 
low relative to a March of Dimes 
estimate of $12 billion in 2011 
dollars.6 However, that estimate 
included both maternity and infant 
care costs; infant care costs alone 
were just over $10 billion.6 It also 
included costs to families as well as 
costs to employer plans, although out-
of-pocket expenditures by enrollees 
raised incremental expenditures in the 
current study by just 2%. Additionally, 
the comparison group was restricted 
to “healthy” term infants, whose 
mean expenditure in 2013 and 2014 
dollars22 was 39% lower than the 
average expenditure for nonpreterm 
infants in the current study. Finally, 
the March of Dimes estimate included 
both LBW and preterm infants.6 
Conversely, we directly estimated 
numbers of privately-insured infants 
who were coded as preterm rather 
than using estimates of preterm births 
indirectly derived from vital records. 
Aggregate cost estimates calculated 
by using the same ascertainment 
methods both to identify affected 
persons and to estimate per-person 
costs are preferred.23
Also, for the first time, we have 
quantified the overlap of medical 
costs during infancy for major birth 
defects and preterm birth. A recent 
analysis found that excluding hospital 
codes for preterm birth would reduce 
US birth defect–related hospital 
cost estimates by approximately 
one-fifth.10 More than one-quarter 
(27.5%) of total expenditures for 
infants born preterm were incurred 
by the 6.5% of preterm infants with 
major birth defects. It also appears 
that the cost of shorter gestation is 
higher for infants with major birth 
defects. In Australia, each additional 
completed week of gestation was 
found to reduce mean cost during 
the first year of life by 10% and 27% 
for infants with and without severe 
neonatal morbidity, respectively.24 
Prevention of the synergistic 
combination of birth defects and 
preterm birth may yield higher cost 
savings.
Our estimates have limitations. 
First, MarketScan Commercial 
data are a convenience sample of 
the US population with ESI that 
over-represents states in the South 
and underrepresents states in 
the West, which have the highest 
expenditures.25 The average 
expenditures for preterm infants in 
the South were 12% less than the 
sample mean, and in the West they 
were 32% greater than the sample 
mean. Therefore, the unweighted 
expenditures likely underestimate 
expenditures for US ESI plans.
The most serious study limitation 
is the inability to reliably ascertain 
preterm birth in administrative 
databases. The ICD-9-CM diagnosis 
codes used to identify infants 
born preterm were developed 
to code diseases for purposes of 
reimbursement, not for surveillance 
of risk factors such as preterm birth. 
In particular, infants who are born 
at 35 to 36 weeks’ gestation and 
do not require additional hospital 
care are less likely to be coded 
as preterm and also have much 
lower hospital days than infants 
who are coded as preterm, similar 
to those born at term. Among 
infants who are relatively healthy, 
the association of preterm birth 
with increased expenditures is 
lower than it is among those with 
severe neonatal morbidity.24 The 
implication is that the estimates of 
per-child expenditures associated 
with preterm birth (especially late 
preterm birth) may be substantially 
overstated by using stand-alone 
administrative databases. On 
the other hand, the incomplete 
sensitivity of the ICD-9-CM codes 
for ascertaining preterm births 
does not bias aggregate estimates of 
expenditures; rather, the aggregate 
estimates are conservative because 
they do not include any incremental 
health care cost for late preterm 
infants who are not coded as 
preterm.
Overstatement of expenditures for 
late preterm infants identified by 
using billing codes with stand-alone 
administrative databases relative 
to actual expenditures for all late 
preterm infants is illustrated by a 
comparison of published estimates 
from 2004 to 2005 MarketScan 
Commercial claims data26 and linked 
California vital records and hospital 
discharge data from 1998 to 2000.2 
According to the MarketScan analysis, 
late preterm infants (33–36 weeks’ 
gestation) had 12.6 times higher 
mean expenditures for the birth 
hospitalization than term infants.26 
In the California analysis, the mean 
cost of birth hospitalizations when 
pooling gestational ages 33 to 36 
weeks was 3.3 times higher than for 
infants with a gestational age of 37 
weeks.2 The latter analysis, which 
used reliable estimates of gestational 
age in combination with linked 
administrative data, yields credible 
estimates of hospitalization costs by 
gestational age.
Not surprisingly, the average per-
child expenditures reported in this 
study by using stand-alone claims 
data are higher than the per-child 
cost estimates reported by the

Downloaded from 
 IOM committee on the basis of an 
analysis of linked birth certificate 
and administrative health care 
data.5 The average medical cost for 
all preterm infants during the birth 
year in the IOM study was $29 041 
in 2005 dollars, 
5 which, adjusted for 
2013 and 2014 medical prices, 
22 is 
equivalent to $35 527. Applying the 
gestational age composition of 2013 
births1 to the stratified cost estimates 
in the IOM report5 yields a birth 
year cost estimate for 2013 births 
of $37 868. Part of the difference 
between this latter figure and the 
lower-bound estimate of $47 099 per 
infant in the current study is due to 
the difference between expenditures 
by employer-sponsored plans and 
population-level costs. An even more 
important contribution, however, 
is the lower likelihood that preterm 
infants without complications are 
coded as preterm. Consequently, the 
average expenditure for all infants 
born preterm is presumably lower 
than the estimates reported here.
The limitations of administrative 
health care databases can be 
remedied through the use of record 
linkages with nonadministrative 
databases (including vital records 
and birth defects surveillance 
systems) to validate diagnoses.27 
Accurate estimates of per-child costs 
associated with preterm birth based 
on record linkage of administrative 
data with US vital records have been 
published.2, 
 
5 A linkage of databases in 
New South Wales, Australia, has also 
generated estimates of the impact of 
preterm birth on health care costs 
during infancy and the first 6 years 
of life.24, 
28 Similarly, linked databases 
have been used to assess health care 
use and costs for infants and young 
children with birth defects.9
Updated estimates of the preventable 
cost of prematurity could be used 
to project cost savings to health 
care payers and society from 
interventions that reduce the number 
of infants born preterm. Such 
estimates ideally should be specific 
to the outcomes of interventions. For 
example, suppose it were possible to 
delay threatened preterm labor by 1 
week. How much would health care 
payers save for each infant whose 
gestational age was raised from 36 to 
37 weeks? To answer that question, 
analyses of cost differences by single 
weeks of gestational age based on 
reliable obstetric estimates1 are 
needed.2 The present findings, which 
are limited to administrative data 
and billing codes, are too crude to be 
used for that purpose.
cOnclusIOns
In the current study, we make 3 
contributions. First, we provide 
conservative, lower-bound 
estimates of the financial impact 
of preterm birth on US employer-
sponsored health plans. Second, 
we call attention to the synergistic 
interaction of preterm birth and 
major birth defects. Infants born 
with serious birth defects incur much 
higher costs if they are also born 
preterm. Third, we identify inherent 
limitations with the use of stand-
alone administrative databases for 
research on prematurity and suggest 
an alternative research approach 
based on the exploitation of record 
linkages of administrative health care 
data with data containing validated 
estimates of gestational age.
