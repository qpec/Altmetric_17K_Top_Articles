Background: Poor oral hygiene has been proposed to contribute to head and neck cancer (HNC) risk, although causal-
ity and independency of some indicators are uncertain. This study investigates the relationship of five oral hygiene indica-
tors with incident HNCs.
Methods: In a pooled analysis of 8925 HNC cases and 12 527 controls from 13 studies participating in the International
Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium, comparable data on good oral hygiene indicators were harmonized.

 These included: no denture wear, no gum disease (or bleeding), <5 missing teeth, tooth brushing at least daily, and visit-
ing a dentist ≥once a year. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of each oral hygiene indicator and cumula-
tive score on HNC risk, adjusting for tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.
Results: Inverse associations with any HNC, in the hypothesized direction, were observed for <5 missing teeth [odds
ratio (OR) = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74, 0.82], annual dentist visit (OR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.78, 0.87), daily tooth
brushing (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.79, 0.88), and no gum disease (OR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.89, 0.99), and no association was
observed for wearing dentures. These associations were relatively consistent across specific cancer sites, especially for
tooth brushing and dentist visits. The population attributable fraction for ≤ 2 out of 5 good oral hygiene indicators was
8.9% (95% CI 3.3%, 14%) for oral cavity cancer.
Conclusion: Good oral hygiene, as characterized by few missing teeth, annual dentist visits, and daily tooth brushing,
may modestly reduce the risk of HNC.

introduction
Primary head and neck cancer (HNC) is estimated to exceed
500 000 cases worldwide per year [1]. Geographic differences
in HNC incidence rates persist among [2] and within some
countries [3]. Although the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco
use varies, regional variations in HNC incidence rates cannot be
explained by these risk factors alone [4].
HNCs include cancers originating in the oral cavity, orophar-
ynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Oral hygiene indicators, such as
missing teeth [5], denture use [6], bleeding gums [7], infrequent
dental visits [8], and tooth brushing infrequency [5, 7, 8], have
been suspected to contribute to the etiology of HNCs. The causal
and independent role of oral hygiene in HNC development has
thus been inconclusive due to the limited numbers of cases as well
as a lack of available detailed information on more than one oral
hygiene indicator for most studies [9–11]. Oral hygiene is not an
established risk factor for HNCs and the population attributable
fraction (PAF) of oral hygiene to HNCs has not been assessed.
In separate analyses of Latin American and central European
case–control studies, poor condition of the mouth, regular
mouthwash use, and lack of tooth-brushing were associated
with HNC risk [8]. Our study expands the scope of this analysis
to include countries from five continents and explores the role
of oral hygiene indicators. We pooled oral hygiene and HNC
data from studies participating in the International Head and
Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) Consortium. This
pooled analysis describes the largest and most comprehensive
assessment of the association between oral hygiene indicators
and HNCs to date, including oral cavity, laryngeal, hypopharyn-
geal, and oropharyngeal cancers.
methods
studies and participants
The pooled analysis consisted of 8925 incident cases and 12 527 controls
from 13 INHANCE case–control studies (data version 1.5) (http://www.
inhance.utah.edu) [12, 13]. Data pooling and questionnaire harmonization
methods have been described previously [12, 13]. Our investigation included
studies from the United States (n = 8), Central Europe (n = 1), Latin America
(n = 2), Japan (n = 1), and one international multicenter study (supplemen-
tary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Subjects with missing
information on all oral hygiene variables were excluded (n = 1013).
Incident cases included patients with invasive tumors of the overall head
and neck (n = 8925), oral cavity (n = 2858), oropharynx (n = 2402), hypo-
pharynx (n = 738), larynx (n = 2086), and oral cavity/pharynx not otherwise
specified (n = 841), as defined by International Classification of Disease, 2nd
edition (ICD-O2) or ICD 9th or 10th edition as previously described [13].
Results for some oral hygiene variables have been previously published for 4
out of the 13 studies [8, 14, 15]. Written informed consent was obtained
from study subjects, and investigations were approved by the institutional
review board at each institution involved [16].
oral hygiene variables
Oral hygiene data were obtained from questionnaires administered by den-
tists in the central Europe study and self-report by face-to-face questionnaire
interviews in other studies. Self-reported oral hygiene has been shown to be
reliable [17–20]. Gum disease (which included periodontal disease and/or
gingivitis) and wearing dentures were defined dichotomously. The number
of missing teeth was defined as <5 or ≥ 5 teeth missing. Tooth brushing was
categorized by frequency as ≥once/day versus <once/day, and dentist visit
frequency as ≥once/year versus <once/year. These data were also coded cat-
egorically: for tooth-brushing frequency 1 = <once/day, 2 = once-to-twice/
day, or 3 = ≥twice/day, regularity of dental visits (never or seldom, <once/
year, ≥once/year); and number of missing teeth number (1 = <5, 2 = 5–15,
and 3 = ≥16). The Puerto Rico, Latin America, and international multicenter
studies contained all five oral hygiene variables.
covariates
Covariates included age (5-year age categories above age 40), sex, race/ethni-
city (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander, Brazilian, and
other), and education level (≤high school versus >high school, to adjust for
educational level across countries with varying access to education). For indi-
viduals not reporting education level (0.1%), multiple imputation was
applied to predict education level for each geographic region separately using
logistic regression models with terms for age, sex, race/ethnicity, study
center, and case–control status under the assumption that data were missing
at random [21]. Alcohol consumption was calculated as the number of
drinks/day based on average cumulative lifetime consumption, assuming
one standardized drink contains 15.6 ml of pure ethanol (non-drinker, 0.1–
0.9, 1.0–2.9, 3.0–4.9, and 5.0+, and missing drinks/day) [13]. Cumulative
tobacco smoking was categorized as those who smoked 0–10.0, 10.1–20.0,
20.1–30.0, 30.1–40.0, 40.1–50.0, and 50.0+ pack-years. Missing data on race/
ethnicity (0.4%), tobacco smoking (6.3%), and alcohol drinking (3.1%) were
included in separate categories in models.

 statistical analysis
Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of oral hygiene indicators and
incident HNCs. All ORs were adjusted for study (and center for multicenter
studies), sex, age, race, education, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking.
P values for monotonic trends were derived from the fitted models of oral
hygiene indicators as continuous variables. Interactions between each oral
hygiene indicator and alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, and geographical
region were assessed with likelihood-ratio tests.
To determine the PAF of poor oral hygiene, an oral hygiene score was cal-
culated for studies that included all oral hygiene indicators. Scores ranged
from 5 to 0 on a best-to-worst oral health scale. The sum of the indicators
was combined: denture wear: yes = 1, no = 0; gum disease: yes = 0, no = 1;
missing teeth: ‘≥5’ = 0, ‘<5’ = 1; regular dental visit: yes = 1, no = 0; teeth
brushing frequency: ‘≥once per day’ = 1, ‘<once per day’ = 0. The referent
category for OR was defined as those with the best scores for oral hygiene
(score ≥4). The PAF was calculated using the formula PEC × (OR – 1)/OR
[22], where OR is the adjusted OR and PEC is the proportion of cases
exposed to the worst oral hygiene. The definition of exposure for calculating
PAF estimates considered subjects exposed when the oral hygiene score ≤2,
and unexposed when the score was ≥3. PAF confidence limits were calcu-
lated with the command aflogit [23].
Harmonization and PAF calculation were completed using the Stata
Statistical Software (Release 12.2; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and all
other analyses were carried out using the SAS Statistical Software (Version
9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
results
Selected characteristics of HNC incident cases and controls, in-
cluding known risk factors, are displayed in supplementary
Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online. After multi-
variable adjustment, inverse associations were observed between
HNC and no gum disease, missing <5 teeth, brushing teeth
≥once/day, and visiting a dentist ≥once/year (Table 1). No asso-
ciation was found between wearing dentures and HNC.

 Stratified associations between oral hygiene and HNC
persisted among participants with risk profiles defined by
smoking, alcohol drinking, and geographic region for gum
disease, tooth brushing, and number of missing teeth with con-
sistent directions of association with non-stratified results (sup-
plementary Table S3, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology online,
displays associations with HNC and oral cavity cancer after
restricting the study to never smokers and never drinkers.
When all oral hygiene variables were adjusted for each other
(38% of the pooled study population that included: Puerto
Rico, the Latin American multicenter, and the international
multicenter), all good oral hygiene indicators were inversely
associated with HNC and oral cancer (Table 2). Magnitudes of
associations between missing teeth and the risk of both HNC
and oral cancer increased 75% and 107%, respectively, com-
pared with models unadjusted for other oral hygiene indicators.
No gum disease increased 95% for HNC and 160% for oral
cancer risk compared with unadjusted models. Associations of
dental visits with HNC and oral cavity cancer were attenuated.
However, HNC attenuation was modest and within the CI of the
unadjusted analysis.
oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and pharyngeal
cancers
Oropharyngeal and pharyngeal cancers were inversely associated
with <5 missing teeth, tooth brushing ≥once/day, and regular
dentist visit after multivariable adjustments. Hypopharyngeal
cancers were inversely associated with brushing teeth ≥once/day
and regular dentist visit. After mutual oral hygiene variable adjust-
ment, strengths of association for cancers of the oropharynx,
pharynx, and hypopharynx cancers were strongest for missing
teeth and wearing dentures.
laryngeal cancers
Laryngeal cancer was inversely associated with <5 missing teeth,
brushing ≥once/day, regular dentist visit, and wearing dentures.
Strengths of association with laryngeal cancer were attenuated
for regular dentist visits, tooth brushing, no gum disease, and

Oral hygiene score is the sum of the five following items: wear denture: yes = 0, no = 1; gum disease: yes = 0, no = 1; missing teeth: ‘≥5’ = 0, ‘<5’ = 1; regular
visit dentist: yes = 1, no = 0; teeth brushing frequency: ‘≥once/day’ = 1, ‘<once/day’ = 0. Oral hygiene scores range from 0 to 5, corresponding to worst to
best oral hygiene.
Odds ratios (95% CIs) were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for age (<40, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75+ years),

ally adjusted logistic regression models.
oral hygiene score
Associations of cancer risk with oral hygiene scores mutually
adjusted for all oral hygiene indicators ranged from 5 to 0 (from
best to worst oral hygiene, respectively) are displayed in Table 3.
The PAF for a suboptimal oral hygiene score ≤2 was 8.9% (95%
CI 3.3%, 14%) for oral cavity cancer and 5.4% (95% CI 0.36%,
10%) for HNCs.
discussion
Associations were observed between oral hygiene indicators and
HNC, independent of alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking.
Having ≤2 indicators of good oral hygiene contributes to an esti-
mated 8.9% of oral cavity cancers. Among the specific HNCs, the
associations with oral hygiene were greatest for oral cavity cancers,
strengthening the possibility of a causal role. Having <5 missing
teeth demonstrated the greatest magnitude of association in the
inverse direction for HNC, in addition to all subsites.
The mechanisms by which poor oral hygiene is associated with
HNCs fall into categories of trauma and inflammation. Causes of
trauma and inflammation are due to coexisting disease and/or
negligence of oral hygiene. Thus, these indicators may be indi-
cative of dysbiotic shifts in the commensal oral microbiome
[24, 25], tooth wear [26], mechanical trauma [27, 28], and general
health maintenance, all of which are linked to cancer.
Tooth loss is directly related to each of the other four oral
hygiene indicators (P < 0.001 for interaction with each), and is
supported by a magnitude of association increase for both HNC
and all subsites when adjusted for all other oral hygiene indica-
tors. It is biologically plausible that missing teeth reflects poor
oral health maintenance (irregular tooth brushing and dental
visits), mechanical trauma, inflammation (secondary to dia-
betes, nutritional deficits), infection (secondary to periodontitis
or gingivitis), and exposures such as nitrosamines [29], tobacco
use [30], and alcohol [30] which also result in tooth loss.
Missing teeth may be causally related to dentures and inflamma-
tion, resulting in gingiva trauma in addition to receding gums,
jawbone weakening, and teeth collapsing [31].
Dental visits had a 26% reduced risk association with oral
cancer (P < 0.001) when adjusted for wearing dentures alone. To
obtain dentures, a patient must visit a dentist more than once
for diagnosis and denture fittings [32]. These necessary dental
visits indirectly lead to treatment for any mechanical trauma or
inflammation that resulted in the need for dentures and had
a significant interaction with wearing dentures (P = 0.005).
Adjusting for regular dental visits resulted in a 20% reduction in
association between wearing dentures and HNCs (OR = 0.81;
95% CI 0.74, 0.89).
In addition to denture fittings, dental visits are also related to
regular teeth cleaning, preventive diagnoses of dental carries,
and an overall better quality of life [32]. In adjusted models,
annual dental visits were associated with a 26% reduction in
HNC for patients with gum disease. Because dental visits were
found to interact with missing teeth (P < 0.001), gum disease
(P = 0.004), and wearing dentures (P < 0.001), the inverse
association of dental visits was attenuated after adjustment for
all oral hygiene indicators.
Gum diseases develop either secondarily to chronic disease or
as a result of neglected health maintenance [33] and was inde-
pendently associated with increased risk of HNC. Previous
observational studies have shown that gum diseases are also
associated with poorly controlled diabetes and smoking [33].
These host-compromising factors may also lead to a strong asso-
ciation between gum disease and HNCs.
Our analysis is limited by factors influencing oral hygiene
indicators and behaviors that could not be adjusted for. Control
and management of diabetes [34], in addition to past and
present medical history of inflammatory oral and/or systemic
conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases
[35], can increase the risk of gum disease and tooth loss
which can increase HNC risk. The consortium, however, previ-
ously found a weak association with diabetes and HNC risk
(OR = 1.09; 95% CI 0.95–1.24) [30]. Our study also includes
only a small proportion of the age group (over the age of 75) in
which osteoporosis is most prevalent (6% cases and 6% con-
trols) and most cases were men. Another concern is that oral
hygiene behaviors such as dental visits, wearing dentures, and
tooth brushing may be influenced by socioeconomic status
(SES) [36] and relative deprivation [37] within and between
countries with access to dental care depending upon national
healthcare system infrastructures and gross national income per
capita [37]. Models in this study were adjusted for SES measured
by educational level and regional disparities measured by study
center. However, SES effects may be slightly underestimated or
overestimated due to absent data on individual income levels,
cultural class systems, and insurance status. We carried out
stratified analysis for each study center (data not shown) and for
four main regions. The stratified analysis was consistent with
overall findings. Likewise, risk for HNCs was predictably lower
for higher educated individuals. Additionally, although frequency
data were measured, we have no data on the duration of teeth
brushing over a year. However, it is reasonable to assume that the
habits of tooth brushing, similar to other daily human hygiene or
grooming rituals, are relatively consistent throughout one’s life.
As with all case–control studies, a possibility of recall bias
exists. Using newly diagnosed (incident) cases, recall of past
events in personal histories tends to be more accurate than preva-
lent cases and cases were less likely to have changed their habits
as a result of the cancer [38]. Because this study also selected rep-
resentative controls from the case population, we were able to in-
vestigate the effect of oral hygiene on HNC cases, much like a
cohort study [38]. Only two studies (2.4% cases and 2.2% con-
trols with variables) utilized non-cancer hospital controls. These
studies had data available for tooth brushing (both HOTSPOT
and Baltimore) and denture wear (Baltimore). Although the mag-
nitude of the inverse relationship between HNCs and tooth
brushing was stronger for these two studies, exclusion from the
analysis resulted in an OR of 0.84; 95% CI 0.65, 0.98.
This study has several strengths. It encompasses a large popu-
lation of low-incidence cancer cases, resulting in more precise
effect estimates and the ability to extend analysis to HNC sub-
sites. Four geographical regions are also included, strengthening
external validity. This study also incorporates multiple oral
hygiene variables using primary data and is able to stratify oral

 hygiene indicators by specific subgroups, eliminating possible
confounders of alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking.
In conclusion, good oral hygiene is associated with lower risk
of HNC. Improvements in oral hygiene by increasing oral
hygiene literacy, particularly for annual dentist visits and daily
tooth brushing, may be protective against HNC, although the
extent of risk reduction is modest.

Background: Adjuvant treatment with interferon (IFN)-α-2a improved disease-free survival (DFS) and showed a trend for
improving overall survival (OS) in melanoma. This trial was designed to examine whether PEG-IFN is superior to IFN with
regard to distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), DFS and OS.
Patients and methods: In this multicenter, open-label, prospective randomized phase III trial, patients with resected
cutaneous melanoma stage IIA(T3a)–IIIB (AJCC 2002) were randomized to receive PEG-IFN (180 μg subcutaneously 1×/
week; 24 months) or IFN α-2a (3MIU subcutaneously 3×/week; 24 months). Randomization was stratified for stage,
