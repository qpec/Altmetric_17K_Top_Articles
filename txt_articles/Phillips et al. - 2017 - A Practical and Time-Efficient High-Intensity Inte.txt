introduction: Regular physical activity (PA) can reduce the risk of developing type 2 dia-
betes, but adherence to time-orientated (150 min week−1 or more) PA guidelines is very 
poor. A practical and time-efficient PA regime that was equally efficacious at controlling 
risk factors for cardio-metabolic disease is one solution to this problem. Herein, we 
evaluate a new time-efficient and genuinely practical high-intensity interval training (HIT) 
protocol in men and women with pre-existing risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
Materials and methods: One hundred eighty-nine sedentary women (n = 101) and men 
(n = 88) with impaired glucose tolerance and/or a body mass index >27 kg m−2 [mean 
(range) age: 36 (18–53) years] participated in this multi-center study. Each completed 
a fully supervised 6-week HIT protocol at work-loads equivalent to ~100 or ~125% 

VO2 max . Change in 
VO2 max  was used to monitor protocol efficacy, while Actiheart™ 
monitors were used to determine PA during four, weeklong, periods. Mean arterial 
(blood) pressure (MAP) and fasting insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment 
(HOMA)-IR] represent key health biomarker outcomes.
results: The higher intensity bouts (~125% 
VO2 max ) used during a 5-by-1 min HIT 
protocol resulted in a robust increase in 
VO2 max (136 participants, +10.0%, p < 0.001; 
large size effect). 5-by-1 HIT reduced MAP (~3%; p < 0.001) and HOMA-IR (~16%; 
p < 0.01). Physiological responses were similar in men and women while a sizeable 
proportion of the training-induced changes in 
VO2 max, MAP
, and HOMA-IR was 
retained 3 weeks after cessation of training. The supervised HIT sessions accounted for 
the entire quantifiable increase in PA, and this equated to 400 metabolic equivalent (MET) 
min week−1. Meta-analysis indicated that 5-by-1 HIT matched the efficacy and variability 
of a time-consuming 30-week PA program on 
VO2 max, MAP
, and HOMA-IR.

conclusion: With a total time-commitment of <15 min per session and reliance on a 
practical ergometer protocol, 5-by-1 HIT offers a new solution to modulate cardio-meta-
bolic risk factors in adults with pre-existing risk factors for type 2 diabetes while approx-
imately meeting the MET min week−1 PA guidelines. Long-term randomized controlled 
studies will be required to quantify the ability for 5-by-1 HIT to reduce the incidence of 
type 2 diabetes, while strategies are required to harmonize the adaptations to exercise 
across individuals.

Substantial correlative evidence indicates that exercise capacity 
and greater self-reported physical activity (PA) (1) both positively 
relate to health. In fact, aerobic capacity (
)

VO2 max  measured in 
the laboratory appears to be a better predictor of health status 
and risk of disease than many other risk factors (2). Furthermore, 
guidance aimed at concurrently improving diet and increasing 
levels of PA has successfully demonstrated substantial reductions 
in the incidence or progression-rates of type 2 diabetes after 
10 years of follow-up (3–5). It is currently a (reasonable) assump-
tion that the increased levels of PA in these trials (3–5) made a 
major contribution to the improved metabolic health. Shorter-
term exercise training intervention studies (6 weeks–6 months) 
attempt to quantify the physiological responses to exercise, relying 
on surrogates or “biomarkers” of health to explore the potential 
efficacy of very divergent training programs. These studies typi-
cally observe gains in aerobic capacity (6) and reductions in blood 
pressure (7) and insulin resistance (IR) following 6–40 weeks of 
supervised training (8). The format of each exercise training pro-
gram (time and exercise intensity) have reflected PA guidelines 
developed from epidemiological observations, e.g., high-volume 
continuous submaximal aerobic training carried out on 3–5 days 
each week (7, 9) with the aim of meeting a time-commitment for 
voluntary exercise of 150 min week−1.
Studies using lower volume very high-intensity interval 
training (HIT) and highly specialist cycle ergometers have dem-
onstrated that modulation of risk factors for type 2 diabetes can 
be achieved by exercising a total of 70–90 min week−1 in small 
groups of individuals (10–14). Nevertheless, while the total time 
for the “bouts” of exercise can be very low (≤5 min day−1), these 
formats of HIT require long recovery periods between each 
bout such that they do not substantially reduce the total time-
commitment to a level that might substantially improve exercise 
participation. Some investigators have raised the possibility 
of gender-specific benefits, which most likely reflect the large 
amount of inter-individual variability observed in any exercise 
training study (15–17) and the small number of subjects studied 
when evaluating any particular variant of HIT (10–14, 18). The 
reliance on a wide range of HIT protocols has meant that neither 
the effect size nor the inter-individual variability has been prop-
erly quantified (10–14, 18) and such divergent protocols limit the 
validity of any meta-analysis approach to address these important 
questions. Indeed, the design of future large-scale outcome stud-
ies of novel exercise paradigms requires reliable estimates of the 
effect size in target at-risk populations and this study evaluated a 
more time-efficient protocol that overcomes some of the practical 
limitations of earlier studies. The initial HIT protocol was based 
on a 1981 study by Ready et al. (19). While the present project was 
not a randomized clinical trial, we did embrace the multi-arm 
multi-stage clinical trial philosophy (20), whereby we monitored 
the HIT protocol efficacy on a rolling basis, by aggregating the 

VO2 maxtraining responses as we went along. This resulted in 
us discontinuing a 7-by-1 min HIT protocol (~100% 
VO2 max 
cycling intensity), in favor of a lower volume, higher intensity 
protocol (5-by-1 min HIT, at ~125% 
VO2 max cycling intensity). 
We were able to confirm that a practical and time-efficient 5-by-1 
HIT protocol not only improved 
VO2 max (on average), but also 
that this particular time-efficient exercise regime was equally 
effective in both men and women at modifying cardio-metabolic 
disease risk factors.

Participant characteristics
For the METAPREDICT HIT trial, we recruited 189 participants 
(Figure 1) across 5 geographical regions: Nottingham (n = 37) 
and Loughborough (n = 18) in the UK, Stockholm (Sweden, 
n = 36), Copenhagen (Denmark, n = 48), and Las Palmas de 
Gran Canaria (Spain, n = 50). All methods relied on across-site 
standard operating procedures. Participants were recruited via 
advertisements in local media, through publicity on the EU and 
University websites, and via links with radio and TV stations. We 
also used demographic databases to post information to potential 
volunteers and put out adverts in local community groups, par-
ticularly those involving sedentary adults. Participants were male 
(n = 88) and female (n = 101), with a mean (range) age of 36 (18–
53) years and body mass index (BMI) of 32.0 (26.6–48.0) kg m−2. 
All participants were classified as sedentary [<600 metabolic 
equivalents (METs) min week−1] using a modified International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire (21), and had a fasting blood 
glucose level consistent with World Health Organization criteria

for impaired glucose tolerance (IFG; >5.5, <7.0 mmol l−1), and/or 
 
a BMI > 27 kg m−2.
All participants were initially screened and excluded if they 
displayed evidence of active cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, or renal disease. They were also 
excluded for history of malignancy, coagulation dysfunction, 
musculoskeletal or neurological disorders, recent steroid or hor-
mone replacement therapy, or any condition requiring long-term 
drug prescriptions. All participants gave their written, informed 
consent to participate. This study was approved by local ethics 
committees at all sites (the University of Nottingham Medical 
School Ethics Committee: D8122011 BMS; the Regional Ethical 
Review Board Stockholm: 2012/753-31/2; the ethics committee of 
the municipality of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg in Denmark: 
H-3-2012-024; Comité Ético de Investigación Humana de la 
ULPGC: CEIH-2012-02; and the Loughborough University Ethics 
Approvals Human Participants Sub-Committee: 12/EM/0223) 
and complied with the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki. To ensure 
accurate results, we were obliged to discontinue training for 
individuals who (i) failed to attend for more than two consecutive 
sessions, (ii) missed more than three (~15%) training sessions in 
total, or (iii) failed to complete their set exercise regime on two 
occasions or more. This was not the case for any participants.
hiT—Protocol 1 (“7-by-1”)
Forty participants [n = 20 men/20 women; age: 37 (20–53) years; 
BMI: 31.0 (27.0–45.5) kg m−2] completed a 7-by-1 HIT protocol 
(Table 1) developed using information from the literature (19, 22). 
7-by-1 HIT protocol consisted of three fully supervised cycling 
sessions per week for 6 weeks. Sessions began with a 2-min warm-
up at 50 W followed by seven sets of 1 min cycling at 100% of 
the work required to elicit 
VO2 max (Corival or Excalibur Sport, 
Lode, Groningen, the Netherlands) with 1 min recovery between 
bouts. For 1 h before, during, and for 1 h after each training

Based on the study monitoring process, allocation of the participants to the HIT groups was sequential. The comparison group was utilized to examine test–retest performance

biomarkers.

session, the participants were only allowed to consume water. 
No adverse events or unintended effects were observed with this 
intervention. However, based on interim analysis, 7-by-1 HIT was 
found to result in a relatively modest increase in 
VO2 max (+6.2%) 
and, thus, was insufficient to assess inter-individual variability in 
response to training [SD of individual responses (SDIR): 106 mL 
O2; 95% CI: −6 to 218 mL (see Data Processing and Statistical 
Analysis)]. Reliance on a 25-W stepwise 
VO2 max protocol was 
considered one limitation of work-load setting for 7-by-1.
hiT—Protocol 2 (“5-by-1”)
The decision was made to use a higher intensity protocol, while 
subjects who had started the 7-by-1 HIT protocol completed the 
protocol and underwent a full clinical assessment (as the protocol 
may still have had benefits on IR). A further 136 participants com-
pleted baseline visits, HIT, and the post-HIT assessment [n = 64 
men/72 women; age: 36 (18–50) years; BMI 32.2 (26.6–48.0) 
kg m−2] for a new higher intensity lower volume (5-by-1) HIT 
protocol (Table 1). The exercise training was fully supervised and 
consisted of three cycling sessions per week for 6 weeks. All ses-
sions began with a 2-min warm-up at 50 W followed by five sets 
of 1 min high-intensity cycling work with 90 s recovery between 
sets with the exception of week 1 where three sets per session 
were performed in sessions 2 and 3. Work-load was determined 
in session 1 of week 1, where participants were asked to perform a 
2-min warm-up at 50 W followed by 1-min bouts of exercise with 
90 s recovery. Exercise started at 85% of the work required to elicit 

VO2 max (Wmax), and increased by 10% (e.g., 95, 105%, etc.) 
 
until the participant was unable to complete a full 1-min bout. 
Intensity for the last bout participants could complete was used 
thereafter for training, with a 10% increase in intensity after 
2 weeks. No adverse events or unintended effects were observed 
for this intervention.
non-exercise Participants
Thirteen participants were allocated at random, within a center, to 
serve as a non-exercise comparison group [Table 1, n = 4 men/9 
women; age: 31 (20–51) years; BMI 33.4 (27.5–41.4) kg m−2]. 
These participants underwent all screening and assessment 
procedures but did not participate in any training. Their data 
served to complement the short-term test–retest variability data 
collected in the intervention groups at the two baseline sessions 
with “test–retest” data covering the full duration of the study.
Pre-Training Physiological 
characterization
Participants were instructed to refrain from exercise for 3 days 
prior to their visit (baseline session 1) and from alcohol and 
caffeine for 1 day (fasting from ~09:00 p.m. and reporting to 
the laboratory 12 h later at ~09:00 a.m.). After 30 min supine 
rest, blood pressure (BP; Omron M2, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, 
Japan) and resting heart rate (RHR) were measured, with mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) calculated as: 2/3 diastolic blood pres-
sure + 1/3 systolic blood pressure. BP and RHR were determined 
as the average of three consecutive measurements. A blood 
sample was taken from a dorsal hand vein for the assessment 
of IR via the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Blood 
was immediately analyzed for glucose concentration (YSI 2300 
STAT Plus glucose analyzer, Yellow Springs Inc., OH, USA) and 
aliquoted in to lithium heparin spray-coated vacutainers (Becton 
Dickinson, NJ, USA) and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min at 
4°C to yield plasma. Plasma was stored at −80°C and shipped for 
centralized analysis of insulin levels by a “high-sensitivity” ELISA 
(K6219, Dako Sweden AB, Stockholm) according to manufac-
turer’s instruction. HOMA-IR was calculated using the standard 
equation of [glucose (mmol/l) × insulin (mU/l)]/22.5 (23).
A 
VO2 max test was then conducted using a cycle ergometer 
(Lode Corival/Excalibur Sport) and a continuous ramp protocol. 
After a 5-min warm-up at 50 W, the work rate was increased 
by 1 W every 4 s. Participants were instructed to cycle to voli-
tional exhaustion. For the duration of the test, expired air was 
analyzed using an inline gas analyzer (e.g., Metamax 3B, Cortex, 
Leipzig, Germany; Vmax N29, Sensormedics, Anaheim, CA, 
USA; COSMED, Rome, Italy) with HR continuously monitored.


VO2 max was estimated as the highest value obtained in a 
15-breath rolling average and a test was deemed valid when the 
participants achieved two of the following three criteria: (i) voli-
tional exhaustion and/or no longer able to maintain a pedal rate of 
50 revolutions per minute despite strong verbal encouragement, 
(ii) heart rate within 10 beats min−1 of age-predicted maximum, 
and (iii) respiratory exchange ratio (RER) ≥1.10. These criteria 
were met in all but one test, which was excluded from analysis 
of 
VO2 max. To assess the reproducibility of this 
VO2 max test, 
the assessment was repeated 7 days later at baseline session 2 (as 
well as across 6 weeks in the non-training group). The coefficient 
of variation (CV) for repeated measurements for 
VO2 max was 
4.4%. As group mean 
VO2 max was not different for visits 1 and 
2 (2.59 ± 0.60 vs. 2.59 ± 0.63 L min−1, respectively) the mean of 
the two visits was taken as the subjects’ baseline value that reduces 
the influence of technical and biological variation and so should 
provide a better estimate of baseline 
VO2 max. At 72–96 h after 
the last exercise training session, participants underwent a third 
study day, identical to visit 1.
Pa and Post-Training Monitoring
Physical activity was monitored using Actiheart devices 
(CamNTech, Cambridge, UK), a chest-worn monitor that records 
heart rate and movement via an accelerometer. The device senses 
the frequency and intensity of torso movements and has been 
shown to be comparable to doubly labeled water for measuring 
energy expenditure (24). Activity data were obtained for 7 days 
prior to study visit 1, prior to study visit 2, during week 3 or 4 of 
HIT, and prior to study visit 4 (during the detraining period). 
Participants were instructed to wear the Actiheart device at all 
times during the monitoring periods (using waterproof Actiheart 
chest strap or using standard ECG electrodes). Participants using 
the ECG electrodes were instructed to place one electrode at the 
site of the fourth intercostal with the second electrode ~10 cm 
to the left (equivalent to V1 and V4 on a 12-lead ECG). These 
participants were instructed to wear the monitor at all times 
with the exception of a very short period each day when they 
were instructed to thoroughly wash and dry the skin under the 
electrodes in order to minimize the risk of contact dermatitis or 
other skin irritation. After completion of the exercise training 
intervention, participants were asked to return to their habitual 
PA levels for 3 weeks (confirmed by Actiheart) and then a fourth 
study day, identical to visit 3, was carried out.
Data Processing and statistical analysis
To bench mark these HIT protocols with literature values, a 
robust post-training group average increase in 
VO2 max had to be 
evident. Power analysis indicated that >29 participants would be 
required to detect a 4% difference between pre- and post-training 

VO2 max with a power of 95% and alpha = 0.05, based on a CV of 
5.7%. To detect a difference of 4% between men and women, for 
change in 
VO2 max, with alpha = 0.05 and a power of 95%, >53 
participants were required. Thus, the analysis was powered for 
primary statistical analysis presented in this paper.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical soft-
ware (version 20.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were either 
tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilks test and analyzed 
with non-parametric tests or log transformed. Differences between 
pre- and post-training values were evaluated using paired sample 
t-tests [n = 40 and n = 136 for 
VO2 max, and n = 36 and n = 133 
for HOMA-IR for 7-by-1 and 5-by-1 protocols, respectively 
(reflecting any missing values)]. Effect size was quantified using 
Cohen’s d (25). Gender differences in training response were 
analyzed using independent sample t-tests. Bivariate correlations 
were assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Repeated 
measures ANOVAs with post hoc Bonferroni tests for multiple 
comparisons were used to assess retention of training effects fol-
lowing 5-by-1 HIT for those participants who completed study 
visit 4 (Figure 1). All data are presented as mean ± SD unless 
stated otherwise.
Quantification of inter-individual responses to training, cor-
rected for estimates of random variation (technical/day-to-day 
biological) was performed according to the procedures proposed 
by Hopkins (26). SD for individual responses (SDIR) were cal-
culated by taking the square root of the difference between the 
squares of the SD of the training effect (SDexp) and the SD of either 
the double baseline measurement (for variables measured twice 
before training) or the SD of the repeated measures carried out in 
the comparison group (SDcon). In addition, paired sample t-tests 
were performed to determine differences between SDexp and 
SDcon, and Levene’s test was performed to determine differences 
between the SDexp for 5-by-1 HIT and the SDexp for an earlier 
study that utilized high volume combined aerobic/resistance 
training [STRRIDE AT/RT study (27)].
Actiheart data were scanned for missing values using a heuristic 
code in R, and data accepted only when ≥80% of minute-by-
minute activity data were available for a 24-h recording period. 
Furthermore, at least 4 days of valid data had to be available for a 
participant to be included in the group analysis (leaving n = 58 for 
5-by-1 HIT). Mean daily energy expenditure (METs) for each of the 
four measurement periods was calculated, and standard thresholds 
were used to determine the percentage of time engaged in activity 
within predetermined intensity zones (sedentary: <1.5 METs; light 
≥1.5 < 3 METs; moderate ≥3 < 6 METs; vigorous ≥6 < 10.2 METs; 
very vigorous ≥10.2 METs). Reliability of the Actiheart data, using 
this data selection criteria, was excellent (R2 = 0.87 for the repeated 
baseline measure; CV = 4.8%). The mean values obtained prior to 
study visits 1 and 2 were used as the baseline values.
resUlTs
Training responses
Following 6 weeks of 7-by-1 HIT, there were modest improve-
ments in mean 
VO2 max (+6.2%, 95% CI: 3.5–8.9%, p < 0.001). 
This equates to a moderate effect size, i.e., Cohen’s d = 0.71 (95% 
CI = 0.25–1.16) for the primary outcome. As expected, Wmax 
(5.3%; p < 0.001) was also increased by 7-by-1 HIT, but no other 
outcomes were significantly altered. For the control group that 
undertook two assessments 6 weeks apart, we observed no sig-
nificant changes between baseline assessment and reassessment 
6 weeks later in any parameter.
Following 6 weeks of the more time-efficient 5-by-1 HIT 
protocol, greater changes were observed for 

Note that the intensity of each bout during the 7-by-1 protocol was 20–30% lower than during the 5-by-1 protocol, indicating that relying on supramaximal (from the perspective 
of aerobic capacity) is probably important for gains in aerobic capacity. Changes in a measure of peripheral insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were more variable with 7-by-1 and not 
improved with the n = 40 sample size for the selected threshold for statistical significance.

able size effect (Cohen’s d = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.97–1.50) (Table 2). 
The increase in 
VO2 max with 5-by-1 HIT was also greater than 
we observed with 7-by-1 HIT (p < 0.05) supporting our interim 
analysis and decision to discontinue that protocol. The absolute 
increase in 
VO2 max with 5-by-1 HIT was significantly higher for 
men (0.32 ± 0.3 L min−1) compared to women (0.19 ± 0.2 L min−1; 
p < 0.001) as expected, but the relative benefits were not (Figure 2). 
Furthermore, 5-by-1 HIT yielded reductions in MAP (2.8%; 
p < 0.001) and HOMA-IR (16%; p < 0.01) (Table 2). Similarly, 
no significant gender differences were apparent for the relative 
training response for MAP or HOMA-IR (Figure 2). Thus, we 
found no evidence that HIT-induced physiological adaptations 
were subject to gender-related dimorphism.
Actiheart-derived PA data demonstrated a small increase 
in PA energy expenditure during the 6-week intervention 
period of 5-by-1 HIT (mean 24-h activity level: 1.46 ± 0.38 
vs. 1.50 ± 0.34 METs) equivalent to an increase of ~400 MET 
min week−1 (p < 0.05). This increase was accounted for by 
increases in the percentage of time spent performing vigorous 
(0.30 ± 0.47 vs. 0.43 ± 0.43%, p < 0.001) and very vigorous 
activities (0.02 ± 0.09 vs. 0.07 ± 0.16%, p < 0.001), i.e., the 18 
HIT sessions. No change was observed in the percentage of 
time spent in sedentary (74.1 ± 16.3 vs. 74.0 ± 14.9%), light 
(18.0 ± 9.1 vs. 17.8 ± 8.6%), and moderate activity zones 
(7.6 ± 8.2 vs. 8.2 ± 7.0%). Thus, carrying out 5-by-1 HIT did 
not alter PA behavior out with the trial.
comparison of inter-individual Variability 
between hiT and high-Volume Training
Inter-individual variability (Figure 3) in training responses 
reflects the fact that there are genuine low and high responders 
for major physiological traits, following any type of exercise 
training program. This variability will be partly due to random 
contributions from technical and day-to-day biological varia-
tion, and partly due to genetic differences between individuals 
(28). For 5-by-1 HIT, change in 

correlated to baseline 
VO2 max (R2 = 0.01, NS) such that low

correlated to baseline MAP (R2 = 0.18, p < 0.001), and Δ log 
HOMA-IR was negatively correlated to baseline log HOMA-IR 
(R2 = 0.07, p < 0.01). In a population sample that had a range 
of blood pressure and log HOMA-IR spanning normal to above 
normal (74 to 127 mmHg and −0.46 to 0.86, respectively), such 
a correlation is expected as both parameters are regulated toward 
a physiologically “normal” value. Nevertheless, on an individual 
basis, this analysis, such as others before it, demonstrates that 
baseline physiological measures are not, on their own, useful at

predicting the health biomarker outcomes of an exercise train-
ing regime, indicating that more sophisticated strategies will be 
required to fulfill such an aim (29).
To contrast the variation observed in response to 5-by-1 
HIT with traditional higher volume exercise training (Figure 3) 
(30), we estimated the “added” variation caused by the training 
intervention (SDIR), over and above the random variation by 
comparing the variability in repeated measures at baseline [or in 
a control group (SDcon)] with the observed variability in response 
to the training intervention (SDexp). For 5-by-1 HIT, the SDcon for 

VO2 max (visit 1 vs. visit 2; 112 ± 94 mL) was lower than SDexp 
(visit 2 vs. visit 3; 204 ± 150 mL; p < 0.001). For 5-by-1 HIT, 
the SDIR was calculated to be 170 mL (95% CI: 23–311 mL). In 
standardized units, the magnitude of the effect for the individual 
responses was large (0.67; 95% CI: 0.11–1.22). For 
VO2 max, the 
SDexp from our previously published data (30) was not significantly 
different from 5-by-1 HIT (204 vs. 234 mL O2). Based on this 
analysis, 95% of people performing 5-by-1 HIT can be expected 
to have a “true” response for 
VO2 max between −79 and +587 mL 
O2. Similarly, for MAP, SDexp exceeded SDcon for 5-by-1 HIT (4.2 
vs. 2.6 mmHg, respectively) resulting in an SDIR of 3.3 mmHg 
(95% CI: 0.3–6.3 mmHg). This is also a large effect in standardized 
units (−1.32; 95% CI: −2.50 to 0.13) and indicates that for 5-by-1 
HIT, 95% of people can be expected to have a response for MAP 
within −9.0 and +4.0 mmHg, i.e., considerable inter-individual 
variability in response to HIT. Despite the extreme differences in

that would be considered unreliable by most). Approximately 40% of subjects 
demonstrate improvement in only one health biomarker, while between 4 and 
9% demonstrate no reliable improvement in any.

the format (volume and intensity) of exercise training between 
5-by-1 HIT and STRRIDE AT/RT (30), no significant differences 
were observed between their respective SDexp for blood pressure 
(MAP: 4.2 vs. 4.5 mmHg) (Figure 3).
The fact that the pattern of variability in response for 
VO2 max, 
MAP, and HOMA-IR (three key biomarkers for cardio-metabolic 
health) to 6 weeks of 5-by-1 HIT is not different from that 
observed in an 6-month high-volume aerobic/resistance training 
intervention suggests that inter-individual variability in responses 
to training is not dependent on exercise mode, exercise-session 
duration, total volume, or the duration of the intervention, but 
rather depends on genetics, epigenetics, and other biological 
factors (28). One important practical consideration is the propor-
tions of subjects that demonstrates “real” improvements in each 
of the main health biomarkers. To address such a question, we 
counted the frequency of people with 0, 1, 2, or 3 positive changes 
in 
VO2 max, MAP, and HOMA-IR defined as an improvement 
over and above technical error for that physiological param-
eter. As can be observed in Figure 4, whether one considers the 
frequency of observing a numerical improvement (unreliable) 
or a gain that is greater than the normal technical error for the 
test, ~50% of subjects improve at least two of the three health 
biomarkers following 6 months endurance training or 6 weeks 
of 5-by-1 HIT.
Physiological changes during Detraining
As a secondary objective, we evaluated the status of training-
induced changes in physiological parameters, from 6 weeks of 
5-by-1 HIT, during a 3-week period where subjects returned to 
their baseline sedentary lifestyle (Figure 5). Seven participants 
(~5%) were lost to follow-up during this period. Actiheart-
derived PA measures confirmed that subjects had returned 
to baseline sedentary behavior (1.48 ± 0.37 METs). 
VO2 max 
tended toward pre-training levels (32% reversal; p < 0.001) after 
3 weeks of Actiheart-verified sedentary behavior, yet remained 
elevated above pre-training values (p < 0.001). The reversal of 
exercise induced changes in MAP following detraining were par-
tial, whereas the HIT-induced changes in HOMA-IR were fully 
retained during this 3-week period, consistent with some earlier 
pilot metabolic protein data (31).

VO2 max, MAP, and HOMA-IR each displayed negative cor-
relations between the changes following 6 weeks of 5-by-1 HIT 
and changes following 3 weeks of detraining ( 
VO2 max: R2 = 0.12, 
p < 0.001; MAP: R2 = 0.30, p < 0.001; HOMA-IR: R2 = 0.15, 
p < 0.001); i.e., high-responding participants tended to lose a 
greater amount of their training gains compared to low respond-
ers, which is logical and further supports that the determinations 
of training-induced changes were biological in origin. SDexp for 

VO2 max for detraining effects exceeded SDcon (178 vs. 112 mL 
O2, respectively), resulting in an SDIR of 138 mL O2 (95% CI: 
12–264 mL O2). Similarly, SDexp for MAP for detraining effects 
exceeded SDcon (4.2 vs. 2.6 mmHg, respectively), resulting in an 
SDIR of 3.3 mmHg (95% CI: 0.3–6.3 mmHg). This suggests the 
existence of low and high responders for retention of training 
effects. However, the amplified effect of technical and day-to-day 
biological variability on delta-scores compared to absolute scores 
limits our ability to draw conclusions on whether variability in 
the responses to training and detraining are strongly linked.

Practical and Time-Efficient HIT

DiscUssiOn
In this study, we adapted an exercise protocol used by Ready et al. 
(19) so that it was practical to implement using a standard electri-
cally braked cycle ergometer and involve a total time-commitment 
of <15 min. We then demonstrated that, on average, 6 weeks of 
this 5-by-1 protocol was efficacious at reducing blood pressure 
and peripheral IR, while increasing aerobic capacity and all to an 
extent identical to high-volume exercise training carried out over 
6 months (8). These observations enable us to claim that time-
efficient exercise (<45 min week−1) can reduce type 2 diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease risk factors in overweight men and 
women. If this exercise behavior was maintained, it should yield 
long-term health benefits (32) with a fraction of the required 
time-commitment associated with the recommendations by cur-
rent public health guidelines (6).
Ready et al. demonstrated over 35 years ago, in Ontario, 
Canada, that 10 1-min intervals at a work-load equating to ~110% 

VO2 max, interspersed with 1-min recovery intervals, yielded 
~8% gains in 
VO2 max. Despite this observation, awareness of 
the potential utility of HIT has only emerged in recent years. 
Recently, Little et al. using the same protocol as Ready et al., found 
improved glycemic control in a small group of people with type 
2 diabetes (22) and we now demonstrate that, in a large group of 
subjects at-risk for developing type 2 diabetes, HIT can improve 
HOMA-IR with a more time-efficient version of this protocol. 
5-by-1 HIT, relying on 50% fewer sprints than Ready et al. (19), 
but at a greater intensity (~125 vs. ~110% 
VO2 max), produced 
an equally robust increase in 
VO2 max (~10%) and reductions 
in HOMA-IR (~16%). We also noted that 6 weeks of 5-by-1 HIT 
has a mean effect for 
VO2 max comparable with 6 months of 
traditional high-volume time-consuming exercise training, indi-
cating that time-efficient HIT can match the efficacy of traditional 
exercise training paradigms for the present health biomarkers, as 
proposed from earlier pilot studies (33).
This study is the first to attribute improvements in health 
biomarkers to the HIT sessions per se, as we show that performing 
HIT did not result in alterations in PA out with the supervised 
training sessions. The lack of “extra-curricular” changes in PA 
is consistent with observations made during studies involving 
long-term high-volume exercise training (34). The estimation 
of energy expenditure using Actiheart monitors enabled us to 
present the HIT intervention protocol in units consistent with 
public health orientated measures of PA. The Actiheart device 
appears sufficiently sensitive to pick up high-intensity exercise 
performed during the HIT sessions, providing reliable free-living 
data on both total PA levels and time spent performing activi-
ties of different intensities. We found that subjects performing 
5-by-1 HIT had an increase in energy expenditure of ~400 
MET min week−1, consistent with the lower end of the current 
US Department of Health “time orientated” recommendations 
for PA (500–1,000 MET min week−1). Thus, we were able to 
demonstrate that it is possible to reach these MET targets in a 
highly time-efficient manner. There were, however, technical 
limitations of the Actiheart monitoring, namely the devices 
produced acceptable data for less than half of our participants 
(reflecting obvious and periodic loss of signal). The participants 
received clear instructions on how to correctly wear the activity 
monitor during free-living conditions, and we do not know what 
caused the loss of signal and further research is needed to make 
continuous PA monitoring more reliable.
Importantly, we found that response variability in response to 
6 weeks of 5-by-1 HIT exceeds technical and day-to-day biologi-
cal variability for aerobic capacity and blood pressure and that 
this variability was similar that observed following 6 months 
of high-volume exercise training (9, 35). We observed, for the 
present three sessions per week training program, a rate of non-
responders for 
VO2 max (~15–20%) comparable to many other 
high volume training programs, involving thousands of volun-
teers typically training 4–5 days week−1 (15, 36–39). Recently, 
it has been claimed that non-responders for 
VO2 max “do not 
exist” (40). This conclusion was based on “under-training”
, then 
re-training four groups of 10 subjects with differing frequencies 
of training per week. The study used a spuriously and low value 
for the 
VO2 max testing variation, i.e., the Wmax error, and 
failed to consider that this “error” applies to both the pre-test 
and post-test values, seriously undermining the validity of the 
study. In addition, they could not replicate in phase one of their 
“study,” the known non-response rate for 
VO2 max seen in much 
larger studies using their 4–5 days week−1 training protocol (15, 
36–39), suggesting some form of recruitment bias. Careful con-
sideration of their data, claims, and an appropriate cutoff value 
for measurement variance indicates that the conclusions reached 
(40) are misleading. Thus, large and robust studies have found 
that physiological responses are heterogeneous to every type of 
exercise training program. Indeed, we present a meta-analysis of 
the genuine response frequencies for our three clinically relevant 
health biomarkers, 
VO2 max, BP, and HOMA-IR (Figure 4), 
demonstrating that at least 50% of the population can expect to 
be a non-responder for one of these biomarkers. This is somewhat 
in agreement with the efficacy noted in the long-term diabetes 
prevention studies (3–5), where type 2 diabetes risk is reduce but 
not eliminated.
We can, therefore, conclude that the present 5-by-1 HIT 
protocol is consistent with other exercise programs, and that it 
is on average sufficient to yield improvements in cardiovascular 
and metabolic parameters in both men and women. Weston 
et al. (41) recently conducted a meta-analysis and concluded 
that improvements in the 
VO2 max of sedentary males (10.0%; 
90% CI: 4.9–15.1%) was greater than for sedentary females 
(7.3%; 2.5–12.1%). We would argue that an accurate estimation 
of the size effect of HIT using meta-analysis methodology and 
numerous very disparate small studies is not robust due to large 
variations in protocol design. While the large confidence inter-
vals presented by Weston et al. were indicative of a high level of 
uncertainty in their analysis, this study relied on a large cohort 
of men and women undertaking an identical training program 
and measurement protocol, and found gains in 
VO2 max were in 
fact comparable in men and women. The same conclusion can be 
reached regarding blood pressure and fasting IR.
Various HIT-like protocols have been utilized in patient 
groups to promote rehabilitation and control risk factors for 
disease (42–44). In fact, many HIT-type protocols have been 
utilized safely in cardiac patients for many years (45). In this 
 10

study, we did not observe any adverse clinical events in a group 
of sedentary participants with risk factors for cardiovascular and 
metabolic disease. However, we do not have the required size or 
duration of follow-up to make recommendations on safety (or 
disease prevention), as such an analysis will require thousands 
of participants (as serious acute clinical events are rare during 
exercise training). Nevertheless, given that the 5-by-1 protocol 
yields a PA MET “score” comparable to current PA targets, is 
equally effective at improving aerobic capacity and reducing IR, 
it would seem reasonable to conclude that it can emerge as an 
effective alternative to high-volume time-consuming aerobic 
exercise training. This is particularly true as the majority of the 
adult population do not meet the lower-intensity time-orientated 
targets and, thus, do not gain some of the benefits of an active life-
style. Thus 5-by-1 HIT could substantially reduce the incidence 
or progression-rates of type 2 diabetes similar to previous long-
term lifestyle interventions (3–5). Notably, the improvement in 
HOMA-IR following 6 weeks HIT is comparable in magnitude 
to 2 years of calorie restriction (46) supporting the idea that 
increased levels of PA via HIT could directly contribute to the 
prevention of type 2 diabetes more rapidly that other types of 
intervention.
