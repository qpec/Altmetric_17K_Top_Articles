In vivo cation exchange in quantum dots for
tumor-specific imaging
Xiangyou Liu1,2, Gary B. Braun1, Mingde Qin3, Erkki Ruoslahti1,4 & Kazuki N. Sugahara1,2
In vivo tumor imaging with nanoprobes suffers from poor tumor specificity. Here, we
introduce a nanosystem, which allows selective background quenching to gain exceptionally
tumor-specific signals. The system uses near-infrared quantum dots and a membrane-
impermeable etchant, which serves as a cation donor. The etchant rapidly quenches the
quantum dots through cation exchange (ionic etching), and facilitates renal clearance of
metal ions released from the quantum dots. The quantum dots are intravenously delivered
into orthotopic breast and pancreas tumors in mice by using the tumor-penetrating iRGD
peptide. Subsequent etching quenches excess quantum dots, leaving a highly tumor-specific
signal provided by the intact quantum dots remaining in the extravascular tumor cells and
fibroblasts. No toxicity is noted. The system also facilitates the detection of peritoneal tumors
with high specificity upon intraperitoneal tumor targeting and selective etching of excess
untargeted quantum dots. In vivo cation exchange may be a promising strategy to enhance
specificity of tumor imaging.

 T
he design of nanoprobes for in vivo tumor imaging has
traditionally focused on optimization of probe properties
such as size, surface coating, and signal intensity to
maximize target sensitivity and specificity1, 2. Nanoparticles larger
than the renal filtration threshold (~ 6 nm) circulate longer and
accumulate more efficiently in tumors than small molecules.
However, long washout periods increase background signals
especially in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; e.g., liver,
spleen). Although surface modification with polyethylene glycol
(PEG) reduces non-specific uptake by liver Kupffer cells, the
tumor to liver ratio (T/Li) for nanoparticles that are not cleared
through the kidneys generally decreases with time, leading
to degraded image contrast3–5. In this study, we explore
an alternative strategy to enhance tumor specificity—selective
elimination of background signals while preserving tumor signals
in vivo. We utilize photoluminescent quantum dots (QDs) as the
platform for quenchable nanoprobes based on the ability of QDs
to undergo cation exchange (ionic etching) with external metal
ions.
Cation exchange in QDs allows rapid modification of the
elemental composition and crystal structure, and has been
exploited to synthesize new nanostructures and modify photo-
luminescence (PL) characteristics6, 7. In QD cation exchange,
metal cations that are embedded within an anion lattice can
exchange with free metal ions in solution. In particular, in QDs
built from large polarizable sulfide (S2−), selenide (Se2−), or
phosphorus (P3−), the internal cations can pass through open
sites between anions leading to effective cation exchange.
Notably, the anionic framework and geometry of the QD core
may be preserved during cation exchange6.
Here, we introduce a biocompatible QD platform, which loses

cation
exchange,

in vivo imaging in 3 steps: First, active delivery of the QDs

Results
Synthesis
of
PEGylated
near-infrared
QDs.
We
first
synthesized highly dispersed near-infrared (NIR) ZnxHg1-xSeyS1-y
QDs (ZHS-QDs) consisting of zinc (Zn2+), mercury (Hg2+), Se2−
and S2−. Hg2+ was doped into the core as a tracer to accurately
study tissue distribution and clearance kinetics. The QDs were
coated with PEG to reduce MPS uptake4. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) revealed a core diameter of 6.6 ± 2.3 nm
(mean ± standard deviation; Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed a hydrodynamic diameter
of ~ 12 nm (Fig. 1b), a size above the renal filtration threshold8.
Elemental
analysis
by
inductively
coupled
plasma
optical
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the composition of the QDs
(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b). PEG was detected by EDS as
carbon (C) and oxygen (O), which accounted for ~ 90% of the
total atoms (Supplementary Table 1). The PL emission peak
was at 685 nm, which was consistent under different excitation
wavelengths (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1c). The quantum
yield (QY) was 12% based on a calculation using Rhodamine 6G
as a standard. A strong PL signal at 800 nm(the tail of the
emission peak) was obtained using 785-nm excitation (Fig. 1e and
Supplementary Fig. 1d), the preferred excitation wavelength for a
Li-Cor
Pearl
Impulse
imager
to
minimize
background
signals
during
in
vivo
imaging
(Supplementary
Fig.
1e).
Approximately 90% of the PL intensity remained after the QDs
were stored at 4 °C for 6 months without visible aggregation of
the QDs (Fig. 1f). Intravenous injection of the ZHS-QDs provided
strong NIR vascular signals in mice (Fig. 1g). Additional QD
properties are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.
In vitro cation exchange reactions in ZHS-QDs. We next
developed an ‘etchant’, which serves as a cation donor to the QDs
and quenches the PL of the QDs by cation exchange. Various
chemicals with cation-exchange capacity quenched ZHS-QDs
in vitro except for Zn(OAc)2 (zinc acetate dehydrate), which
increased the PL probably by providing extra Zn2+ to the
QDs (Fig. 1h). One of the most efficient etchants was Ag(S2O3)23−
(Ag-TS), which consisted of silver ions (Ag+) stabilized with
thiosulfate (TS), a metal chelator used as a clinical detoxifying
agent for heavy metal ions9, 10. Ag-TS provided Ag+to the QDs in
exchange with Zn2+ and Hg2+ (Fig. 1i), and rapidly quenched the
QDs (Fig. 1d,e). Stoichiometric in vitro quenching studies in
aqueous solution at room temperature showed that > 95% of
ZHS-QDs were quenched when Ag-TS was added at an Ag to Zn
molar ratio of 1:1 or higher (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Treating

 ZHS-QDs with Ag-TS (Ag to Zn = 1:1) resulted in near complete
quenching of the QDs within 10 s (Supplementary Fig. 1g). These
results are consistent with earlier studies, which reported rapid
and nearly complete cation exchange reactions under ambient
conditions6, 11. The completion of cation exchange can be
attributed to several factors: adequate Ag to Zn molar ratio, the
small number of atomic layers and large surface area of QDs, the
high thermodynamic driving force to form the exchanged
product (Ag2S and Ag2Se), and the TS solubilizing agent,
which ligates free Ag+, Zn2+ and Hg2+ ions to minimize
the formation of any surface nanoprecipitate that might otherwise
reduce exchange rates7.
ICP-OES and EDS of the QDs showed that Ag-TS treatment
led to the release of Hg2+and Zn2+ from the core in exchange for
Ag+ (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b). The released Hg2+ and
Zn2+ were detected in the buffer by ICP-OES (Fig. 1j). These
results confirmed that effective cation exchange was achieved.
More than 80% of the C and O remained after Ag-TS
treatment suggesting minimal change in the surface PEG layer
(Supplementary Table 1). The XRD spectra of ZHS-QDs after
Ag-TS treatment showed that new peaks corresponding to Ag2S
and Ag2Se appeared confirming the ICP-OES and EDS results
(Supplementary Fig. 1h). Accordingly, the extinction coefficient
of the QDs increased after etching, consistent with Ag-TS
inducing a material transformation of the core (Supplementary
Table 2). The QD core size after etching was 6.0 ± 1.9 nm
suggesting a small change in the size of the QDs (Fig. 1a and

unchanged and precipitation was not observed (Fig. 1b).
In vitro quenching of various QDs induced by Ag-TS. Ag-TS
quenched QDs with differences in PL emission peak, QY, and
composition, such as manganese-doped zinc sulfide (Mn/ZnS)

indium
phosphide
zinc
sulfide
(InP/ZnS) QDs(QY = 40%), and copper indium sulfide zinc
sulfide (CIS/ZnS) QDs (QY = 15%; Fig. 2). Of note, amphiphilic
coating with HS-(CH2)11-(OCH2CH2)6-NH2 made CIS/ZnS-QDs
resistant to Ag-TS treatment likely because the coating inhibited
cation penetration. These results suggest the wide applicability of
chemical etching to various types of QDs, and a way to produce
etching-resistant QDs. In addition, combination of QDs with
different colors and etchable properties may allow multicolor and
multiplex in vivo imaging.
In vivo cation exchange reactions in ZHS-QDs. Intravenous
injection of Ag-TS into mice eliminated systemic ZHS-QD signals
within 30 s (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The etchant was quickly
excreted or functionally consumed because a second dose of
ZHS-QDs 10 min later produced strong signals. A second dose of
Ag-TS effectively quenched the QDs indicating that repetitive
in vivo imaging can be performed over short intervals. Intra-
peritoneal injection of Ag-TS completely eliminated QD signals
in ~ 30 min reflecting the absorption kinetics of intraperitoneal
Ag-TS into the blood stream13(Fig. 3a and Supplementary
Fig. 2b). Delaying the timing of intraperitoneal Ag-TS injection
allowed the QDs to enter the liver in higher quantity, and led to a
significant liver signal after etching (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d).
The resistance of the liver signals to Ag-TS treatment suggested
that some QDs were phagocytosed by Kupffer cells, which
protected the QDs from the circulating etchant. The liver signals
became more evident when we modified the surface of ZHS-QDs
with positive charge, which makes nanoparticles more prone to
uptake by Kupffer cells14 (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Subcutaneous

 QDs in vitro (Fig. 1h), led to near-complete in vivo quenching of
systemic ZHS-QD signals in 20 min (Supplementary Fig. 2f).
Elemental analysis of biological samples collected from mice
that
received
an
intravenous
ZHS-QD
injection
revealed
progressive Hg2+ shift from the blood into the liver and spleen,
indicating MPS uptake of the QDs (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
Subsequent etching with intraperitoneal Ag-TS caused rapid
redirection of Hg2+ into the kidney and urine, apparently as a
result of in vivo cation exchange and renal clearance of Hg2+. The
liver Hg2+ level in the etched group remained as high as that in
the non-etched group up to 24 h likely reflecting the QDs that
had already entered the liver by that point combined with uptake
of free Hg2+ (a product of etching) by hepatocytes17. However,
the level gradually decreased overtime in contradiction to the
progressive increase observed in the non-etched group. Hg2+
became nearly undetectable in all the organs tested within 10 days
of etching. ICP-OES analysis of ZHS-QDs isolated from the
serum of the mice showed that the Ag-TS treatment caused a
decrease in Zn, near complete elimination of Hg, and new
incorporation of Ag in the QDs supporting the notion that in vivo
cation exchange occurred (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Biochemical
analysis of mouse blood samples 24 h and 1 week after ZHS-QD
and/or Ag-TS injections did not show elevated transaminases or
hyperbilirubinemia suggesting minimal hepatotoxicity (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3c). ZHS-QDs did not cause renal impairment. A
possible transient creatinine increase was associated with Ag-TS
injections, but it was statistically insignificant. No microscopic
pathological changes were found (Supplementary Fig. 3d).
Passive distribution of ZHS-QDs into tumors. Circulating
nanoparticles can passively distribute into tumors by enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect18. However, this process
requires several hours, and passive distribution may not be
enough to deliver compounds in sufficient quantity against high
interstitial fluid pressure in tumors18, 19. In our experiments,
intravenous injection of PBS and ZHS-QDs followed by intra-
peritoneal injection of Ag-TS resulted in minimal tumor signals
in mice bearing orthotopic MCF10CA1a human breast cancer
xenograft tumors (Fig. 3a).
Tumor-specific systemic delivery of etchable ZHS-QDs. To
actively deliver ZHS-QDs to tumors, we used the tumor-
penetrating
cyclic
peptide,
iRGD
(amino
acid
sequence:
CRGDKGPDC)20. iRGD carries a tumor-specific RGD motif and
an RXXR/K motif (CendR motif). The RGD motif initially targets
the peptide to tumor vasculature by binding to αv integrins, and
after a proteolytic cleavage step, the CendR motif interacts with
neuropilin-1.
The
interaction
with
neuropilin-1
increases
extravasation and energy-dependent endocytosis of the peptide
and bystander molecules in a tumor-specific manner20–22.
The bystander effect peaks in about 30 min and remains for up
to 60 min, providing a window to deliver co-injected free
compounds into the extravascular tissue in a tumor-specific
manner23.
ZHS-QDs were intravenously injected into MCF10CA1a breast
tumor mice 25 min after an intravenous dose of iRGD, which led
to a strong tumor signal buried in systemic background signals
(Fig. 3a). The tumor signal became more visible as the
background gradually faded over time likely because of QD
clearance by MPS or quenching by various endogenous factors
such as oxidation24–26. However, the signal to noise ratio
remained low (Fig. 3c). In contrast, etching with intraperitoneal
Ag-TS
performed
30 min
after
ZHS-QD
injection
steeply
lowered the background signals making the tumor-specific signal
become apparent (Fig. 3a). The background signals decreased to
~ 10% within 10 min from etching, while 75% of the tumor signal
remained (Fig. 3b). After 30 min, almost no background was
noted, while over 50% of the tumor signal remained. The tumor-
specific signal stayed apparent for at least 210 min after etching.
CRGDC, a control RGD peptide without tissue-penetrating
properties20, 27, did not enhance tumor signals. Etching decreased
tumor signals to a similar degree in each group indicating
baseline passive diffusion of Ag-TS into the tumors regardless of
peptide pre-injection.
Contrast index (CI), defined as equation (1), is a parameter for
tumor-specific image quality3, 28.

ð1Þ
A CI of 2.5 is a general cut-off for substantial tumor-specific
detection with optical imaging3. In breast tumor mice that
received iRGD, ZHS-QDs, and Ag-TS, CI reached 2.5 at 10 min
post-etching, followed by a continuous increase to reach 10 after
an additional 20 min (Fig. 3c). Mice that received PBS or CRGDC
pre-injection instead of iRGD reached a CI of ~ 2.5 after etching,
representing the EPR effect. However, the dim tumor signals were
suboptimal for practical imaging.
The quality of breast tumor images was further assessed at
40 min post-etching. In vivo live animal imaging (Fig. 4a), in situ
imaging after necropsy (Fig. 4b), and ex vivo imaging of resected
tissues (Fig. 4c) all showed tumor-specific signals in the iRGD
group, while minimal fluorescence was found in the non-iRGD
group. Signal intensity in the resected tumors was fivefold higher
in the iRGD group than the control (Fig. 4d). T/Li ratio, a
hallmark for tumor specificity, was 4.9 in the iRGD group, which
is 17.5-fold higher than the average value (0.28) of previously
reported inorganic nanoprobes in general, and 70-fold higher
than the average value (0.07) of those with a size similar to the
ZHS-QDs3, 5 (Fig. 4d). The T/Li ratio in the non-iRGD group was
0.98, suggesting near-equal QD intensity in the tumor and the
liver.
Effects of etching on extracellular and endocytosed QDs. These
results indicate successful tumor-specific extravascular delivery of
ZHS-QDs by iRGD, and effective intravascular etching by Ag-TS.
However, given that Ag-TS can also extravasate to some extent
through leaky tumor blood vessels (Fig. 3b)29, we hypothesized
that the QDs in the extravascular tumor tissue were internalized
in cells and that the etching was limited to the extracellular space.
In a cellular context, neuropilin-binding CendR peptides such as
iRGD activate an endocytic pathway similar to macropinocytosis,
which helps bystander compounds to enter cells22. On the other
hand, Ag-TS has an overall negative charge and hardly diffuses
across cell membranes, making this hypothesis a valid one. In
in vitro cell culture studies, iRGD allowed co-applied ZHS-QDs
to enter MCF10CA1a cells (Fig. 4e). Addition of Ag-TS to the
culture
media
led
to
etching
of
membrane-bound
QDs
leaving internalized QDs intact indicating that the etching was
limited to the extracellular space. Similar results were obtained
when Ag-TS was applied to PC-3 human prostate cancer
cells pre-cultured in the presence of CdSe/ZnS-QDs coated
with RPARPAR, a neuropilin-1-binding CendR peptide, with an
N-terminal KCDG peptide linker (Fig. 4f)30. Confocal micro-
scopy of MCF10CA1a tumor sections collected from mice,
which received iRGD, ZHS-QDs, and Ag-TS, showed widespread
ZHS-QDs in the extravascular tumor space (Fig. 4g). The
majority of the QDs were internalized into tumor cells and also
stromal cells expressing α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a
marker for carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Only minor
QD signals were noted in control organs (Supplementary Fig. 4a).

 These results support the hypothesis that the QDs were delivered
into cells in the extravascular tumor tissue, which made them
resistant to subsequent etching.
In vivo imaging of pancreatic cancer with ZHS-QDs. The
finding that the iRGD/ZHS-QD system targeted CAFs prompted
us to test the utility of the system for imaging desmoplastic
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We prepared mice
bearing orthotopic tumors created with KRAS-Ink PDAC cells
established from transgenic p48-CRE/LSL-KrasG12D/INK4aflox
mice31, 32. The tumors develop a mixture of high-grade pan-
creatic
intraepithelial
neoplasia
(PanIN)
and
desmoplastic
PDAC32 (Fig. 5a). Injection of ZHS-QDs and Ag-TS resulted in
minimal signals (Fig. 5b). Adding iRGD pre-injection led to a
strong focal signal in the left flank where the tumor was located.
Ex vivo imaging confirmed a strong tumor-specific signal
(Fig. 5c). The T/Li ratio was 2.9, ~ 10 times higher than pre-
viously
reported
values
of
general
inorganic
nanoprobes3
(Fig. 5d). The QDs widely distributed in the extravascular PDAC
stroma
with
significant
co-localization
with
CAFs
in
the
iRGD group (Fig. 5e). The QDs were also found around PanINs
suggesting
that
the
method
could
detect
premalignant
lesions. Only trace QD signals were noted in non-tumor tissues
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Collectively, the etchable QD system in
combination with iRGD can serve as an intravenous probe to
detect
tumors,
especially
desmoplastic
tumors,
with
high
specificity.
Intraperitoneal delivery of ZHS-QDs to peritoneal tumors.
Intraperitoneally administered iRGD facilitates penetration of
co-administered compounds into peritoneal tumors in a tumor-
specific manner33. Accordingly, the ZHS-QDs in combination
with iRGD were tested for the ability to probe peritoneal tumors
created with luciferase-positive MKN45P-luc human gastric
cancer cells in mice33. Intraperitoneal co-injection of iRGD and
ZHS-QDs led to strong fluorescence localized in the abdomen of
the peritoneal tumor mice (Fig. 6a). No obvious extraperitoneal
signal was noted. Subsequent intraperitoneal injection of Ag-TS
abolished most of the fluorescence within 5 min leaving a focal
signal, which co-localized with luminescent peritoneal tumors.
The peritoneal tumor-specific probing was confirmed by in situ
imaging of the mice (Fig. 6a) and ex vivo imaging of resected
tissues (Fig. 6a). Signal intensity in the resected peritoneal tumors
was threefold higher in the iRGD group than those in the control
group (Fig. 6b). Confocal microscopy showed strong QD signals
in peritoneal tumors especially in stroma-rich areas (Fig. 6c).
Almost no QDs were found in non-tumor tissues (Supplementary
Fig. 4b). Intraperitoneal injection of ZHS-QDs and Ag-TS with-
out iRGD did not lead to tissue probing.
The lack of systemic NIR signals in the peritoneal tumor
mice that received iRGD and ZHS-QDs suggested that the
QDs
entered
the
tumors
predominantly
through
local
penetration and not through the circulation. Indeed, intraper-
itoneal co-administration of iRGD promotes local entry of
dextran and small-molecule drugs into peritoneal tumors in a
circulation-independent manner33. However, iRGD-coated nano-
particles have been shown to enter the circulation from the
abdominal cavity, and target peritoneal tumors through a
combination of both circulation-dependent and -independent
pathways34, 35. To separate the two pathways in the peritoneal
tumor targeting by iRGD/ZHS-QDs, we tested the efficacy of
extraperitoneal tumor targeting by intraperitoneally administered

 iRGD/ZHS-QDs in mice bearing a subcutaneous MKN45P-luc
tumor in addition to the peritoneal tumors. Intraperitoneal
injections of iRGD and ZHS-QDs followed by Ag-TS led to
strong
NIR
signals
in
the
peritoneal
tumors,
while
the
subcutaneous
tumor
remained
macroscopically
unprobed
(Fig. 6d). Quantification of fluorescence intensity in the resected
subcutaneous and peritoneal tumors further confirmed the results
(Fig. 6e). These results strongly suggest that the ZHS-QDs
minimally entered the circulation, and if any, circulating ZHS-
QDs had minor effects on peritoneal tumor targeting after
intraperitoneal co-injection of iRGD and ZHS-QDs. Thus, the
peritoneal tumor-specific probing was likely a result of local QD
entry into the tumors facilitated by iRGD. These results indicate
that local delivery of etchable QDs into peritoneal tumors
followed by etching of excess QDs in the abdominal cavity allows
peritoneal tumor-specific imaging. Collectively, the etchable QD
system in combination with iRGD can be a powerful diagnostic
platform and an aid in debulking surgeries for peritoneal
carcinomatosis33, 36, in addition to serving as an intravenous
imaging probe for various types of tumors.
Synthesis and characterization of Hg-free etchable QDs. Given
the
success
in
highly
tumor-specific
imaging
using
the
etchable ZHS-QD system, we set out to improve the system by
synthesizing Hg-free PEGylated QDs to avoid any potential
Hg exposure in vivo. The QDs, ZAS-QDs, consisted of Zn, Ag, Se
and S, as confirmed by EDS analysis (Supplementary Table 1).
The core diameter of the ZAS-QDs was 6.8 ± 4.3 nm based
on TEM measurements (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 5a). The
PL emission extended beyond 800 nm with a peak at 708 nm,

 which made the QDs applicable to NIR imaging (Fig. 7b, c, and
Supplementary Fig. 5b). The QY was 2%.
Ag-TS abolished the PL in seconds in vitro, and slightly
reduced the core size to 5.2 ± 1.8 nm (Fig. 7a–c, Supplementary
Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Elemental analysis showed
that the Ag to Zn ratio significantly increased upon Ag-TS
treatment without major changes in the anion ratio indicating
that cation exchange took place (Fig. 7d and Supplementary
Fig. 5c). Nearly 90% of C and O remained after etching indicating
that the PEG layer largely remained associated with the QD
surface (Supplementary Table 1). Crystallographic analysis with
XRD of the QDs showed a peak shift towards a higher angle with
the emergence of peaks for Ag2S and/or Ag2Se after Ag-TS
treatment, supporting the mechanism of quenching by Ag ion
exchange in the QD core (Supplementary Fig. 5d).
In vivo imaging of peritoneal tumors with ZAS-QDs. The ZAS-
QDs were tested in mice bearing MKN45P-luc peritoneal tumors
for in vivo imaging. Intraperitoneally injected ZAS-QDs were
strongly detected in live animals with a Li-Cor Pearl imager under
an 800 nm channel (Fig. 7e). The NIR signal was limited to the
abdominal
cavity
suggesting
minimal
entry
of
ZAS-QDs
into systemic circulation. Subsequent intraperitoneal injection
of Ag-TS eliminated the signal within 5 min. Almost no fluor-
escence was noted in peritoneal tumors suggesting that there was
minimal tumor entry of the QDs. When iRGD was given together
with the ZAS-QDs and subsequent intraperitoneal etching
was performed, strong fluorescent signals co-localizing with
luminescent peritoneal tumors were found. In situ imaging of
abdominal and thoracic organs and ex vivo imaging of resected
tissues (Fig. 7e) confirmed the peritoneal tumor specificity of the
NIR signals. Almost no NIR signal was noted in extraperitoneal
subcutaneous tumors suggesting that the ZAS-QDs entered the
peritoneal tumors through a circulation-independent fashion
(Fig. 7e–g). Consistent with these findings, confocal microscopy
showed strong QD signals on peritoneal tumor surfaces with

 decreasing signals extending into the tumor interior (Fig. 7h). The
majority of the QD signals were associated with nucleated cells.
Importantly, there was significant co-localization with a reticular
fibroblast marker suggesting that the stroma, mainly consisting of
fibroblasts, served as a conduit for QD penetration into the
tumors. In subcutaneous tumors, some QD-positive blood vessels
were present suggesting that the QDs entered the circulation to
some extent at microscopic levels (Supplementary Fig. 4b).
QDs were not evident in non-tumor tissues. Thus, the Hg-free
ZAS-QDs have etchable properties similar to ZHS-QDs, and
provide highly tumor-specific signals when used in combination
with iRGD and the Ag-TS etchant, demonstrating their capacity
in tumor-specific in vivo imaging.
Discussion
This study introduces an important concept in imaging whereby
probe brightness is controlled in vivo with a biocompatible
chemical reaction. We have achieved exceptionally tumor-specific
imaging by delivering etchable QDs specifically into tumor tissue
through intravenous and intraperitoneal routes followed by
preferential etching of excess counterparts in non-tumor tissues
(Fig. 8). The differential etching is enabled by the contrast of QD
dynamics between the rapid and active intratumoral spreading
facilitated by iRGD, and the slow and passive accumulation
into normal tissues5, 37. In particular, performing the etching
procedure soon after achieving tumor-specific targeting of
PEGylated QDs can minimize their non-specific entry into the
MPS (e.g., liver and spleen). The lack of etching of intratumoral
QDs can be attributed to a combination of endocytosis, which
protects QDs from a membrane-impermeable etchant, and the
transient time window for iRGD to deliver QDs into tumor tissue
and cells before subsequent etching is performed21.Compared to
our previous Ag nanoparticle-based system that releases a dye
upon etching38, it is noteworthy here that low background was
achieved by directly modifying the chemical composition of the
emitting species—a concept that may be extended to other
fluorophores and imaging modalities. Although a metal-free
etchable platform with a dissolvable core is ultimately desired
for human use, this proof-of-concept study lays the groundwork
for next-generation nanoprobes with extremely high tumor-
specificity.

pellets were bought from Amresco (Solon, OH). iRGD and CRGDC peptides were
synthesized in house21. H2O was purified using a Milli-Q (EMD Millipore) system.
Cell lines and mouse models. MCF10CA1a human breast cancer cells39, KRAS-
Ink mouse PDAC cells31, PC-3 human prostate cancer cells30, and MKN45P-luc
luciferase-positive human gastric cancer cells33were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U ml−1
penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin. The human cell lines were authenticated
by the DNA Analysis Core Facility at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical
Discovery Institute (La Jolla, CA) and the KRAS-Ink cell line was authenticated by
DDC Medical (Fairfield, OH). All the cells were tested negative for mycoplasma
contamination. Female BALB/c and athymic nude mice were both purchased from
Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Orthotopic breast tumors were generated
by injecting 2 × 106 MCF10CA1a cells into the mammary fat pad39, and orthotopic
PDAC tumors were generated by injecting 2 × 106KRAS-Ink cells into the
pancreas20 of female nude mice at 10 weeks of age. Peritoneal tumor mice were
generated by injecting 107 MKN45P-luc cells into the peritoneal cavity of female
nude mice at 10 weeks of age33. All animal procedures were performed according
to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute.
Synthesis and characterization of QDs. ZHS-QDs were synthesized based on a
previously reported method with modifications40. Specifically, CH3O-PEG2000-SH
powder (360 mg) was added into NH4HCO3 solution (2.4 ml, 0.2 M, pH = 12.4
adjusted with 5 M NaOH) and completely dissolved after short sonication. Zn
(OAc)2· 2H2O (900 μl, 100 mM) and Hg(ClO4)2· xH2O (270 μL, 100 mM) were
then added into the solution and quickly mixed, followed by immediate addition of
freshly prepared sodium hydrogen selenide (NaHSe, 180 μl, 250 mM)40. Adding
NaHSe caused the reaction solution to turn dark instantly, indicating QD
formation. After mixing in the dark at room temperature (RT) for 1 h, the solution
was moved to 4 °C for passivation for 48 h. After centrifugation (11,000 × g, 10 min,
4 °C), the supernatant containing dispersed QDs was collected, neutralized with

Positively charged ZHS-QDs (ZHS-NH2) were prepared via the same
procedure as above except that CH3O-PEG2000-SH was replaced with HS-
PEG2000-NH2. Mn/ZnS QDs were synthesized as previously reported41. CdSe/ZnS
core/shell QDs were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). InP/ZnS QDs
and CIS/ZnS QDs, both coated with 3-mercaptopropionic acid, were bought from
NNCrystal US Corporation (Fayetteville, AR). All the QDs were water-soluble.
CdSe/ZnS QDs coated with cell-penetrating KCDGRPARPAR peptides
(LifeTein, Somerset, NJ) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions associated with the eFluor 605NC sulfhydryl-reactive conjugation kit
(eBioscience). CIS/ZnS-QDs coated with HS-(CH2)11-(OCH2CH2)6-NH2 were
prepared as described earlier42.
ZAS-QDs were synthesized by first adding 3-mercaptopropionic acid (10 µl)
and Zn(OAc)2· 2H2O (75 μl, 100 mM) to NH4HCO3 solution (0.2 ml, 0.2 M,
pH = 12.8 adjusted with 5 M NaOH). After vortexing for 30 s, CH3O-PEG2000-SH
(45 mg) and DMPS (5.4 mg) in H2O (0.2 ml, 4 °C) were added to the solution, and
the solution was vortexed again for 30 s. Finally, NaHSe (15 μl, 250 mM) was
added, followed by immediate addition of AgNO3 (75 μl, 200 mM) and vortexing
for 30 s. After mixing in the dark at RT for 1 h, the solution was moved to 4 °C for
overnight passivation. The solution was centrifuged (11,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and
the supernatant was washed first in H2O, then in PBS, by ultrafiltration with
Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filters (NMWL 10 KDa) until the pH of the filtrate
neutralized. After another centrifugation (11,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatant
was passed through a 0.22 μm syringe filter, and kept in the dark at 4 °C until use.
The concentrations of all ZHS-QDs and ZAS-QDs samples described in this study
are expressed as Zn2+ concentration unless otherwise stated.
TEM was performed with a JEM-1200EX II electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo,
Japan) operating at 80 kV. Absorbance spectra were measured with a
DU800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, CA), and PL spectra were measured
with a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). QYs for ZHS- and
ZAS-QDs were determined by using Rhodamine 6 G as standard (QY = 95% in
ethanol). The QY values for CdSe/ZnS-, InP/ZnS- and CIS/ZnS-QDs were acquired
from the commercial source. EDS spectra were acquired using aXL30-SFEG UHR
scanning electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) equipped with a Silicon Drift
Detector iXRFEDS analyzer (E2V, Chelmsford, Essex, UK), operating at 10 kV.
XRD measurementswere performed on a MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at 30 kV and
15 mA. ICP-OES measurement was performed with an Optima 3000 DV ICP-OES
spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA). DLS was carried out with Malvern
Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Worcestershire, UK) to determine the hydrodynamic size of
the QDs.
Synthesis of etchants and in vitro etching studies. Ag-TS was synthesized as
follows. AgNO3(0.08 mmol) was added into PBS (500 μl) and mixed for 30 s
forming a precipitate. Na2S2O3 in H2O (0.2 M, 1 ml) was then added to the solution
and mixed for 5 min to allow the precipitate to dissolve. After filtration with a 0.22
μm syringe filter, a clear colorless solution was obtained (0.05 M Ag-TS stock
solution, designated as ‘10×’). The solution was diluted 5 or 10 times with PBS to
obtain a 2× or 1x Ag-TS solution, which was used on the same day for in vivo
etching studies.
To study the principle of etching, ZHS-QDs or ZAS-QDs in PBS (7.5 mM, 350 μl)
were mixed with either PBS (100 μl) or 10x Ag-TS etchant (100 μl) for 1 h at RT,
followed by ultrafiltration in H2O with Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filters (NMWL
10 kDa). The filtrates and concentrates were collected separately for ICP-OES
measurement42. The collected concentrates were also subjected to TEM observation
and PL spectra measurement.
Aqueous solutions of various chemicals were prepared to examine their
etching capacity in vitro. The concentration was 1 mM for all the chemicals
except for Na2S2O3 (Na-TS), which was 2.5 mM, and Ag-TS and Cu-TS,
which were prepared by mixing AgNO3 (2 mM) or CuSO4 (2 mM) with an
equal volume of Na-TS (5 mM). Each chemical (400 µl) was mixed with ZHS-QDs
(400 µl, 0.5 mM of Zn2+) at RT for 1 min. Immediately, the mixtures were
imaged with a Li-Cor Pearl imager under the 800 nm channel, and the PL
spectra of the mixtures were also immediately measured with an excitation
wavelength of 450 nm. Emission peak intensity was used to calculate relative
PL intensity. A mixture of ZHS-QD solution (400 µl, 0.5 mM) and H2O (400 µl)
was used as a positive control, the relative PL intensity of which was considered
as 100%.
To study time-dependent quenching kinetics of ZHS-QDs, the QDs in PBS
(1 ml) with Zn concentration of 5 µM was added into a cuvette. Fluorescence
was collected at regular time intervals, showing a steady fluorescence signal. Ag-TS
(2 mM of Ag) was then quickly mixed in the sample in the cuvette to a final
Ag concentration of 5 µM. A Horiba FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer was used at
450 nm excitation (2 nm slit width) and 650 nm emission (5 nm slit width)
with integration time of 0.5 s per point. To correct for background signal, the
intensity of PBS using these settings was measured and subtracted from all
data points. To study stoichiometric quenching kinetics, equation (2) was used for
different molar ratios of Ag to Zn:
ZHS quenched %
ð Þ ¼ 100 ´ 1 �
PL intensity of ZHS�QD with Ag-TS � background
PL intensity of ZHS�QD without Ag-TS � background
�
�
ð2Þ
All the experiments were performed at room temperature.
To study the etchability of different QDs, aqueous solutions (400 µl per
solution) of Mn/ZnS (Zn concentration: 10 mM), InP/ZnS (0.25 mg ml−1) and
3-mercaptopropionic acid-coated and HS-(CH2)11-(OCH2CH2)6-NH2-coated CIS/
ZnS (0.5 mg ml−1) QDs were added with an equal volume of 1x Ag-TS or H2O,
while CdSe/ZnS (QD concentration: 3.2 nM) in H2O (400 µl) was added with an
equal volume of 10× Ag-TS or H2O. After mixing at RT for 5 min, the mixtures
were subjected to PL imaging and PL spectra measurement. PL imaging was
performed with an UV/White light transilluminator LMW-20 (UVP, Upland, CA)
for Mn/ZnS QDs, an Illuma tool Bright Light System LT-9900 (Lightools
Research, Encinitas, CA) for CdSe/ZnS and InP/ZnS QDs and HS-(CH2)11-
(OCH2CH2)6-NH2-coated CIS/ZnS QDs, and a Li-Cor Pearl imager under 700 nm
channel for 3-mercaptopropionic acid-coated CIS/ZnS QDs.
In vitro QD uptake by human tumor cells. PC-3 cells, which express neuropilin-
1, a cell surface receptor for the KCDGRPARPAR peptide30, were incubated in
96-well plates with KCDGRPARPAR-coated CdSe/ZnS QDs (QD concentration:
25 nM) for 90 min at 37 °C. The cells were subjected to epifluorescence imaging
with a Leica DMIRE2 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) before and after the
addition of 1x Ag-TS (1 µl) to each well containing 100 µl of culture media.
MCF10CA1a cells were incubated with or without iRGD peptide (final con-
centration: 50 µM) in culture media in chambered coverglass (Nunc Lab-Tek II,
Rochester, NY) for 30 min at 37 °C, and ZHS-QDs were added to each chamber
(final concentration: 1 mM Zn2+). After incubation for 2.5 h at 37 °C, the cells were
washed once with PBS, and cultured in fresh culture media containing Hoechst
33342 (10 µg ml−1 in 400 µl, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 10 min at 37 °C.
Etching was performed by adding 1x Ag-TS (100 µl) to each chamber and
incubating the cells for 1 min at RT. The cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM
710 NLO confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) before and after
etching.
Biodistribution, clearance, and in vivo toxicity. BALB/c female mice10–12 weeks
of age were intravenously injected with 100 μL of PBS or ZHS-QDs in PBS
(18 nmol Zn per g body weight) followed 30 min later with intraperitoneal injection
of 300 μL of PBS or 1x Ag-TS. For biodistribution and clearance studies, the mice
were sacrificed under deep anesthesia 1 h, 24 h, and 10 days after Ag-TS injection.
Major tissues, serum, feces and urine samples were collected for quantification of
mercury with ICP-OES42. To examine in vivo toxicity, blood was collected from
the retro-orbital plexus of each mouse under deep anesthesia into a lithium-
heparin 1.3 ml micro tube (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) after 24 h and 1 week,
and plasma was isolated by centrifugation. The plasma (100 μl) was pipetted into a
Comprehensive Diagnostic Profile Rotor (Product Part No. 500-1038, Abaxis,
Union City, CA) and subjected to biochemical toxicity assays using an
AbaxisVetScan VS2 chemistry analyzer. The mice were then sacrificed under
deep anesthesia, and tissues were collected and processed for paraffin embedding.
Sectioned paraffin blocks were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and
whole slide scanning was performed with a Leica SCN 400 slide scanner.
Imaging of normal mice. Female nude mice without tumors were anesthetized
with isoflurane and imaged with an 800 nm channel with a Pearl Impulse small
animal imaging system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) before any injection. Then, the mice
were intravenously injected with ZHS-QDs at a dose of 18 nmol Zn per g body-
weight per injection. Some mice received an intravenous dose of PBS (100 μl) or
iRGD (100 μl, 2.5 mM in PBS) 25 min before the QD injection. Subsequent etching
was performed at time points indicated in each Figure by either
anintravenous injection of 1x Ag-TS (100 μl), intraperitoneal injection of
1× Ag-TS (300 μl), or three consecutive subcutaneous injections of a mixture
of D-penicillamine and CuSO4 at a volume of 50 μl per injection. The penicilla-
mine/CuSO4solution was prepared by mixing stock solutions of D-penicillamine
(40 mM) and an equal volume of CuSO4 (20 mM) just prior to use and without
filtration. We used a higher intraperitoneal dose of Ag-TS than that of intravenous
Ag-TS because intraperitoneal delivery generally leads to lower peak plasma
concentrations than intravenous delivery13. In some cases, the mice were sacrificed
under deep anesthesiafor tissue collection.
Imaging of breast tumors and PDAC in mice. Pre-injection imaging of mice
bearing an orthotopic MCF10CA1a breast tumor or KRAS-Ink PDAC was
performed under anesthesia with isoflurane using a Pearl Impulse imager equipped
with an 800 nm channel. The mice were intravenously injected with PBS (100 μl) or
iRGD or CRGDC in PBS (100 μl, 2.5 mM), followed by an intravenous injection of
ZHS-QDs in PBS (100 μl) at a dose of 18 nmol Zn per g body-weight 25 min
later. Subsequent etching was performed by an intraperitoneal injection of 300 μl of
1× Ag-TS in breast tumor mice or an intravenous injection of 100 μl of 2x Ag-TS
in PDAC mice. In some cases, ZHS-NH2QDs in PBS (100 μl) at a dose of 18 nmol

 Zn per g body-weight were injected instead of ZHS-QDs. The mice were
anesthetized and imaged at different time points as shown in each Figure. After
in vivo imaging, the mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia. Breast tumor mice
received cardiac perfusion of PBS, while PDAC mice did not. The necropsied mice
(in situ imaging) and resected tissues (ex vivo imaging) were imaged with the
Pearl Impulse small animal imaging system. The tissues were processed for
immunofluorescence as described elsewhere20. In some cases, PDAC tissues were
embedded in paraffin for H&E staining and subsequent histology analysis as
described elsewhere21. Fluorescence intensity quantification was performed with
Li-Cor Image Studio Lite 4.0 software to calculate CI, fluorescent signal per tissue
area, and T/Li ratios.
Imaging of peritoneal tumor in mice. Mice bearing MKN45P-luc peritoneal
tumors were intraperitoneally injected with ZAS-QDs (30 nmol Zn per g body-
weight) or ZHS-QDs (45 nmol Zn per g body-weight) in PBS (500 μl) with or
without 450 μg of iRGD. At 70 min postinjection of QDs, the mice were
intraperitoneally injected with luciferin (15 mg ml−1 in PBS, Biosynth
International, Itasca, IL) at a dose of 0.28 mg per g body-weight. The mice were
then anesthetized with isoflurane, and imaged at different time points for
luminescence with a Xenogen IVIS imager (Perkin-Elmer) and for NIR with
a Li-Cor Pearl Impulse imager under 800 nm channel. Some mice also had an
extraperitoneal subcutaneous MKN45P-luc tumor in the presence of the peritoneal
tumors. At 90 min postinjection of QDs, 1× Ag-TS (400 μl) was intraperitoneally
injected. After 5 min, the mice were imaged with the Xenogen IVIS and Li-Cor
Pearl Impulse imagers. The mice were then immediately sacrificed under deep
anesthesia by cardiac perfusion with PBS, and the necropsied mice (in situ
imaging) and resected tissues (ex vivo imaging) were imaged again. The abdominal
cavity of the necropsied mice was not washed before in situ imaging. The tissues
were processed for immunofluorescence as described elsewhere33. Fluorescence
intensity quantification was performed with Li-Cor Image Studio Lite 4.0 software.
Immunofluorescence. Tissue sections were treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for
10 min, washed with PBS 3 times, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h,
and incubated with a rat anti-mouse CD31 primary antibody (Catalog number:
553370, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), rabbit anti-mouse α-SMA antibody
(Product code: ab5694, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or a rat anti-mouse ER-TR7
antibody (Catalog number: sc-73355, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at 4 °C
overnight. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG
(Catalog number: A-11006) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Catalog number: A-11034)(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). After
washing with PBS, sections were mounted in DAPI-containing mounting
medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined under a Zeiss LSM
710 NLO confocal microscope.
Statistical analysis. At least three mice were analyzed per group. The mice were
randomly assigned to each study group. No sample size estimates or blinding
techniques were used. All statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism
7 or Excel (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; ns, not significant). Unless otherwise
stated, all data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s two-tailed t-test or one-way
or two-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc analysis. A value of P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
