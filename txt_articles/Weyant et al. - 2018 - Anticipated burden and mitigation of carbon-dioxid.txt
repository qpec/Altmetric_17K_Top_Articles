Abstract
Background
Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are anticipated to decrease the zinc and
iron concentrations of crops. The associated disease burden and optimal mitigation strate-
gies remain unknown. We sought to understand where and to what extent increasing carbon
dioxide concentrations may increase the global burden of nutritional deficiencies through
changes in crop nutrient concentrations, and the effects of potential mitigation strategies.
Methods and findings
For each of 137 countries, we incorporated estimates of climate change, crop nutrient con-
centrations, dietary patterns, and disease risk into a microsimulation model of zinc and iron
deficiency. These estimates were obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, US Department of Agriculture, Statistics Division of the Food and Agriculture Orga-
nization of the United Nations, and Global Burden of Disease Project, respectively. In the
absence of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, we estimated that zinc and iron defi-
ciencies would induce 1,072.9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally over the
period 2015 to 2050 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 971.1–1,167.7). In the presence of increas-
ing carbon dioxide concentrations, we estimated that decreasing zinc and iron concentra-
tions of crops would induce an additional 125.8 million DALYs globally over the same period
(95% CrI: 113.6–138.9). This carbon-dioxide-induced disease burden is projected to dispro-
portionately affect nations in the World Health Organization’s South-East Asia and African
Regions (44.0 and 28.5 million DALYs, respectively), which already have high existing dis-
ease burdens from zinc and iron deficiencies (364.3 and 299.5 million DALYs, respectively),

 increasing global nutritional inequalities. A climate mitigation strategy such as the Paris
Agreement (an international agreement to keep global temperatures within 2˚C of pre-indus-
trial levels) would be expected to avert 48.2% of this burden (95% CrI: 47.8%–48.5%), while
traditional public health interventions including nutrient supplementation and disease control
programs would be expected to avert 26.6% of the burden (95% CrI: 23.8%–29.6%). Of the
traditional public health interventions, zinc supplementation would be expected to avert
5.5%, iron supplementation 15.7%, malaria mitigation 3.2%, pneumonia mitigation 1.6%,
and diarrhea mitigation 0.5%. The primary limitations of the analysis include uncertainty
regarding how food consumption patterns may change with climate, how disease mortality
rates will change over time, and how crop zinc and iron concentrations will decline from
those at present to those in 2050.
Conclusions
Effects of increased carbon dioxide on crop nutrient concentrations are anticipated to exac-
erbate inequalities in zinc and iron deficiencies by 2050. Proposed Paris Agreement strate-
gies are expected to be more effective than traditional public health measures to avert the
increased inequality.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are anticipated to decrease the
zinc and iron concentrations of some crops.
• The disease burden induced by changes in zinc and iron concentrations in crops, and
optimal mitigation strategies, are unknown.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We developed a country-level microsimulation model of zinc and iron deficiency to
project the health effects of zinc- and iron-deficiency-related diseases in terms of disabil-
ity-adjusted life years accumulated over the period 2015 to 2050, worldwide.
• We estimated that carbon-dioxide-induced reductions in the zinc and iron concentra-
tions of crops would be expected to induce approximately 125.8 million disability-

ing South-East Asian and sub-Saharan African countries.
• We also estimated that a climate mitigation strategy concordant with the Paris Agree-
ment would avert a greater portion of this burden (approximately 48.2%) than tradi-
tional public health interventions (approximately 26.6%).

Introduction
Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are anticipated to affect public health
through increased unsafe weather events, extreme heat, air pollution, and allergen and disease
vector exposure [1]. Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations are also anticipated to reduce
the concentrations of zinc and iron in many agricultural crops, particularly C3 plants, which
rely solely on C3 carbon fixation and include common rice and wheat varieties; C3 plants con-
stitute 95% of terrestrial plants, account for over half of global caloric consumption, and serve
as the primary source of dietary zinc and iron for populations at highest risk of nutritional
deficiencies [2–5]. The empirical observation of lowered zinc and iron concentrations under
elevated carbon dioxide is well established, although the mechanisms are not yet well under-
stood and likely relate in part to changes in crop transpiration [2,5,6]. Zinc and iron deficien-
cies, in turn, increase the risk of infections, diarrhea, and anemia [7,8]. It remains unclear,
however, where and to what degree increasing carbon dioxide concentrations may increase
the global burden of nutritional deficiencies, and which strategies may best mitigate the
increase. An active area of public health policy debate is whether direct climate change mitiga-
tion strategies, such as the Paris Agreement, will be sufficient or comparable to traditional pub-
lic health measures to combat the complications of carbon-dioxide-induced zinc and iron
deficiencies—particularly supplementation and disease control programs to combat the
heightened risk of infections, diarrhea, and anemia [9].
The impact of increased carbon dioxide on nutritional deficiencies and their associated dis-
eases depends on 5 related factors: the magnitude of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations; the resultant changes in crop nutrient concentrations; current and future
trends in consumption of crops and other dietary nutrient sources; the risks of deficiencies,
given dietary consumption; and the risks of disease, given nutritional deficiencies.
We developed a model (Fig 1) to estimate where and to what degree increasing carbon
dioxide concentrations would be expected to increase the global burden of zinc and iron defi-
ciencies and their associated diseases over the period 2015 to 2050. We used this model to eval-
uate which strategies may best mitigate the burden of disease attributable to increased carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. Specifically, we created a microsimulation in which demographi-
cally representative populations in each country were or were not exposed to carbon-dioxide-
induced changes in the zinc and iron concentrations of crops, and experienced related disease
burdens quantified in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
Methods
Data sources
To estimate the impact of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations on nutritional deficiencies
and associated disease rates, we used 5 main data sources. We focused our analysis on

 country-level estimates of the following: carbon dioxide concentration changes from the Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change [10], crop zinc and iron concentrations from the US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) [11], changes in crop zinc and iron concentrations due to
increasing carbon dioxide concentrations from Myers et al. [5], dietary supply from the
Fig 1. Model schematic. In the model, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations decrease the zinc and
iron concentrations of crops. Data on food nutrient concentrations and consumption are used to calculate changes in
zinc and iron intake distributions. These distributions and weighted estimated average requirements (WtdEARs) for
nutrients are used as inputs to a microsimulation, which projects health outcomes due to carbon-dioxide-induced
declines in the zinc and iron concentrations of crops.

 Statistics Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO-
STAT) [12], and disease prevalence among different populations globally from the Global Bur-
den of Disease Project (GBD) [13]. Example values for Nigeria are shown in Table 1, with links
to primary data for other countries in S1 and S2 Texts.
Model structure
We incorporated the data into a microsimulation model (Fig 1) that simulates individuals
within each country, reflecting the range of consumption of zinc and iron given the variations
in dietary patterns in each country, and associated zinc and iron deficiency status and atten-
dant risks for infections, diarrhea, and anemia. For each of 137 countries with data, we simu-
lated 2 identical samples of 10,000 individuals demographically distributed to match country-
specific age, sex, and secular birth/death trends. Each individual was probabilistically given val-
ues of zinc and iron consumption, morbidity risk, and mortality risk (Table 1; Fig 1). One pop-
ulation sample was subjected to carbon-dioxide-induced declines in the zinc and iron
concentrations of crops while the other maintained current levels of zinc and iron concentra-
tions. The primary model outcome was the difference between the 2 populations in DALYs
per 1,000 persons. DALYs are the sum of years of life lost from disease and years of life lived
with disability, weighted by the disability associated with each disease endpoint (Table 1).
In the simulation, we assumed that current dietary patterns (number of kilocalories/capita/
day consumed of each food category) would remain the same despite increasing carbon diox-
ide concentrations, meaning that individuals would not adjust their total intake of food, or
types of food eaten, based on reduction in nutrients in each crop. Average food consumption
per capita in each country was determined from FAOSTAT data on approximately 100 mutu-
ally exclusive and collectively exhaustive food categories, such as potatoes, bovine meat, and
beans [12]. The baseline zinc and iron contents per 100 grams and energy density of each food
type were obtained from USDA data [11]. Country-specific zinc consumption distributions

 were constructed assuming normality and coefficients of variation (CVs) of 25% [16–18]. This
method of constructing zinc consumption distributions from FAOSTAT and USDA data is
similar to that used by Kumssa et al. [14]. Country-specific iron consumption distributions
were also constructed assuming normality and CVs of 25% following prior literature [16]. An
alternative assumption for iron consumption distributions, lognormality with CVs of 40%
[19], was applied in sensitivity analysis (S4 Text). The annual crop-specific declines in zinc and
iron concentrations due to increasing carbon dioxide were estimated from nutrient concentra-
tions of crops grown under carbon dioxide concentrations expected by the year 2050 [5] with
assumed linear declines in crop concentrations over the period from 2015 to 2050. The
expected carbon dioxide concentrations by the year 2050 used in [5] are based on the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change’s assessment of carbon dioxide concentration projections
[10], which are the same in all countries. Specifically, projected declines in the micronutrient
concentrations of particular crops were extrapolated to broader crop categories, in keeping
with previous studies (S1 Text) [9,20].
Given the annual level of zinc and iron consumed by each simulated individual, we deter-
mined whether an individual fell below a critical threshold level of zinc or iron intake that
would be labeled “deficiency” and would predispose the individual to disease, using the esti-
mated average requirement cut-point method [21–23], which compares a person’s average
annual intake to the corresponding weighted estimated average requirement (WtdEAR). A
WtdEAR is an average micronutrient requirement for a population and can be calculated by
multiplying the requirement for each demographic group by the fraction of people in that
demographic group and summing; the requirement for each demographic group is based on
population-specific absorption factors [24].
The microsimulation model estimated the total morbidity and mortality burden associated
with zinc and iron deficiencies per 1,000 people and for the overall population in each country.
Zinc deficiency is associated with a heightened relative risk of morbidity and mortality from
malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea among children under 5 years, with no heightened disease
risks among older persons [7]; the disability weights attributable to each of these conditions
were obtained from prior assessments (Table 1) [8,13,15]. Prevalence rates, mortality rates,
and trends over time for malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea in each country were obtained
from the GBD [13]. Mortality trends assumed continuation of the annual percent change in
the per capita mortality for each disease as calculated by the GBD. The GBD calculated these
values based on historical data from 1990 to 2013. Similarly, disease prevalence trends assumed
continuation of the annual percent change in the prevalence rate for each disease from 1990 to
2013 as obtained from GBD data; in sensitivity analysis, disease prevalence rates were held
constant (S8 Table). Iron deficiency was simulated as producing associated anemia, with dis-
ability weights, mortality rates, and mortality trends over time also from GBD data [8,13]. We
note that iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are not equivalent, but because
IDA occurs when iron deficiency is sufficiently severe to reduce red blood cell production
[25,26], the estimated average requirement cut-point method is a viable strategy for estimating
the relative increase in IDA [27].
Model validation
Validity of model estimates was assessed by comparing model estimates to values reported in
the literature [8,13,14] (S1–S3 Tables). Model estimates subjected to validation included cur-
rent zinc and iron dietary supplies and percent deficiencies, current yearly disease burdens,
and projected disease burdens from 2015 to 2050 (calculated from current yearly burdens and
assuming continuation of secular trends in the scenario without climate change).

 Comparative effectiveness
We considered alternative strategies to mitigate the disease burden from increased zinc and
iron deficiencies attributable to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. Specifically, we
compared 5 traditional public health strategies to strategies consistent with the Paris Agree-
ment to maintain global temperatures within 2˚C of pre-industrial levels, adjusting each strat-
egy for current anticipated feasibility and population reach. The 5 public health strategies were
(i) zinc supplementation [28], in which zinc is administered daily to cover 80% of children
under 5 years of age with random selection; (ii) iron supplementation [29], in which iron is
administered weekly to cover 80% of females over 5 years of age; (iii) malaria mitigation [30],
in which a previously described portfolio of interventions (e.g., long-lasting insecticide-treated
nets, indoor residual spraying, and mass screening and treatment) is adopted at an 80% cover-
age level; (iv) pneumonia mitigation [31], in which a previously described portfolio of inter-
ventions (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, antibiotics for
pneumonia, promotion of breastfeeding, vitamin A supplementation, and environmental
improvements) is adopted at an 80% coverage level (except for the H. influenzae and pneumo-
coccal vaccines, which are adopted at 90% coverage); and (v) diarrhea mitigation [31], in
which a previously described portfolio of interventions (e.g., oral rehydration solution, rotavi-
rus vaccine, antibiotics for dysentery, promotion of breastfeeding, vitamin A supplementation,
and environmental improvements) is adopted at an 80% coverage level (except for the rotavi-
rus vaccine, which is adopted at 90% coverage). Each strategy is detailed in S5 Text.
Sensitivity analyses
We performed 1-way sensitivity analysis, in which parameters were varied one at a
time ± 10%, across all model inputs (S4 Text; S2–S8 Figs). In particular, we varied initial zinc
and iron intake distributions across ranges to account for potential changes in dietary patterns
and uncertainties in the quality of current measurements, initial disease prevalence rates to
account for potential underreporting, and disease mortality rates conditional on deficiency to
account for potential changes in healthcare availability. We also performed probabilistic sensi-
tivity analysis by running the model 10,000 times per country while Monte Carlo sampling
from probability distributions around each input parameter to compute uncertainty intervals
for each outcome (S4 Text; S5–S8 Tables). Probability distributions for input parameters were
determined based on previously reported probability distributions, uncertainty estimates, and
natural bounds. The model was programmed in R version 3.2.2 [32], with input data and sta-
tistical code for replication and extension of our analysis published at https://purl.stanford.
edu/tx325yy8269 concurrent with publication.
Results
Model validation
Our model-based estimates of nutrient supply, nutrient deficiency, and associated disease had
a high degree of correspondence to current estimates from other sources (S1–S3 Tables). Spe-
cifically, our model-based estimates of global population-weighted zinc supply and deficiency
were within 0.8% and 3.3% relative error from values in the literature, respectively [14]. Our
estimate of global population-weighted iron deficiency was within 0.6% of values in the litera-
ture [8]. Our estimates of the 2015 DALY burdens due to malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and
IDA were within 2.4%, 0.3%, 1.4%, and 0.2%, respectively, of values in the literature [13]. Esti-
mated 2015 to 2050 DALY burdens due to malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and IDA globally
were within 0.7%, 1.3%, 2.0%, and 2.7%, respectively, of values in the literature [13]. All other

 model-based results showed high concordance with prior estimates of current nutrient defi-
ciency and disease (S1–S3 Tables).
Changes in zinc and iron deficiencies
In the absence of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, zinc and iron deficiencies would be
expected to induce 1,072.9 million DALYs globally over the period 2015 to 2050 according to our
model. This global burden would represent approximately 2.0% of the expected DALYs due to all
diseases of any kind over this period, which would make zinc and iron deficiencies the 13th leading
risk factor for DALYs if the relative burdens attributable to other risk factors did not change [33].
In the presence of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, decreased zinc and iron con-
centrations of crops would be expected to lead to an additional 125.8 million DALYs globally
over the period 2015 to 2050, with a disproportionate burden in the World Health Organiza-
tion’s South-East Asia and African Regions (Fig 2). Countries in the study sample would be
expected to experience increases in carbon dioxide concentration from approximately
400 ppm to 550 ppm (a 37.5% increase) from 2015 to 2050 and resultant declines in zinc and
iron concentrations of C3 crops of approximately 5%–10% [5,9,10,34]. Given current con-
sumption patterns, per our model, the nutrient concentration changes would induce an addi-
tional 8.2 percentage point increase in zinc deficiency (from the current baseline rate of 32.0%
of the population deficient) and 6.1 percentage point increase in iron deficiency (from the
baseline of 21.8% deficient) in the South-East Asia Region—the most highly affected region for
zinc/iron deficiency—by 2050. The least-affected region, by contrast, would be the European
Region, which would be anticipated to experience an additional 1.9 percentage point increase
in zinc deficiency (from a baseline of 3.7% deficient) and 3.4 percentage point increase in iron
deficiency (from a baseline of 11.1% deficient). The difference in the fraction of people placed
at risk of zinc deficiency was not primarily due to a greater dependence on C3 crops in the
South-East Asia Region for dietary zinc, but because a higher portion of the current population
is only marginally above the threshold for zinc deficiency.

adjusted life years (DALYs)/103 people is shown. These values reflect the additional zinc and iron deficiency burden of disease due to
increasing carbon dioxide, and background disease burdens are subtracted. Countries in white were those for which data were not

 Model results suggested that carbon-dioxide-induced reductions in zinc and iron concen-
trations among crops would increase between-country and between-region inequalities in
DALY burden per person (Fig 3). The regions with highest initial per capita burdens due to
carbon-dioxide-induced zinc and iron reductions would also be expected to be the most
affected over the 35-year period, with increased disparities over time. For example, the WHO
African Region would be expected to experience approximately twice the per capita burden of
other regions, such as the European Region, over the study period. Moreover, the regions with
the highest per capita burdens due to carbon-dioxide-induced reductions (WHO African and
South-East Asia Regions) are those with the highest current estimated burdens due to zinc and
iron deficiencies (e.g., the current per capita burden of zinc and iron deficiencies in the African
Region is approximately 4 times that of the European Region).
Mitigation strategies
Compared with the 5 modeled traditional public health interventions, a climate mitigation
strategy such as the Paris Agreement would be expected to avert the greatest portion of the
cumulative projected burden of carbon-dioxide-attributable zinc and iron deficiencies
Fig 3. Cumulative per capita burden of disease attributed to carbon-dioxide-induced declines in the zinc and iron
concentrations of crops, 2015 to 2050. The points show mean cumulative disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1,000
population, with error bars reflecting 1 standard deviation above and below the mean from 10,000 probabilistic simulations. The size
of the points for each population is scaled to show initial DALY burden per 1,000 population in 2015 due to zinc and iron
deficiencies. Regions are as defined by WHO.

 between 2015 and 2050 (Fig 4). Even with 80% coverage with zinc and iron supplementation
and with intensive disease control programs for malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea, the sum
total of the public health measures would be anticipated to reduce only 26.6% of the global car-
bon-dioxide-attributable zinc and iron deficiency burden of disease (95% credible interval
[CrI]: 23.8%–29.6%). The countries that benefited most from the public health programs were
those with high current zinc and iron deficiency DALY burdens (e.g., countries in the African
Region), as these countries are expected to experience the greatest increases in deficiencies and
highest disease rates over the study period.
By contrast, interventions consistent with the Paris Agreement to keep global temperatures
within 2˚C of pre-industrial levels, which was previously anticipated to feasibly prevent
approximately 47% of the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations by 2050 [35,36], would be
expected to avert 48.2% of global carbon-dioxide-attributable zinc and iron deficiency burden
of disease (95% CrI: 47.8%–48.5%). Since the 2015 carbon dioxide concentration was approxi-
mately 400 ppm and the 2050 carbon dioxide concentration is projected to be approximately
550 ppm [5,9,10,34], adhering to the Paris Agreement would be expected to result in a 2050
carbon dioxide concentration of approximately 480 ppm.
The greater effectiveness of the climate mitigation strategy relative to the public health mea-
sures was driven by the fact that it benefited the entire population, whereas the public health
measures were targeted to subsets of the population with the highest per capita DALY burden,
Fig 4. Effect of mitigation strategies, 2015 to 2050. Six mitigation strategies were considered for each of 137 countries. They
included climate mitigation per the Paris Agreement to keep global temperatures below 2˚C of pre-industrial levels; daily zinc
supplementation for 80% of children under 5 years of age; weekly iron supplementation for 80% of women; and malaria,
pneumonia, and diarrhea mitigation programs previously described in the literature adopted at 80% coverage levels (S5 Text).
The microsimulation of 1 million people was run 100 times per country per strategy. The boxplots show median, interquartile,
and outlier reductions in cumulative carbon-dioxide-induced disability-adjusted life year burdens from 2015 to 2050 for countries in
each region by strategy. Of note, while there is considerable variation in carbon-dioxide-induced disease burden between iterations
(Fig 3), there is relatively little variation in reduction in cumulative burden. This lack of variation is caused by the fact that all the
mitigation strategies effectively reduce deficiencies or diseases on a percent basis (see Methods). Regions are as defined by WHO.

 missing substantial populations with small per capita, but large aggregate, DALY burdens. Fur-
thermore, the Paris Agreement reversed carbon-dioxide-induced deficiencies and related dis-
eases, unlike the public health measures, which each addressed only a single form of deficiency
or disease manifestation. The credible intervals for the percent reductions in disease burdens
with the mitigation strategies were relatively small as all the mitigation strategies effectively
reduce deficiencies or related diseases on a percent basis.
Sensitivity analyses
The relative benefits of the climate mitigation strategy versus the traditional public health strat-
egies were unaltered by using a wide range of alternative literature-based input parameters
(S2–S8 and S10 Figs; S7 and S8 Tables). In particular, the relative superiority of the climate
mitigation strategy did not qualitatively change with alterations to baseline zinc and iron
intakes, disease prevalence, or mortality rates. Model projections were generally most sensitive
to changes in inputs related to iron (e.g., iron consumption, WtdEARs for iron, and IDA dis-
ability weights; S2–S8 Figs), but no scenario altered the comparative effectiveness of climate
mitigation relative to traditional public health measures.
Discussion
Carbon-dioxide-induced reductions in zinc and iron concentrations among crops are antici-
pated, by our model, to lead to an additional 125.8 million DALYs globally over the period
2015 to 2050. A disproportionate burden of these DALYs is anticipated to affect countries with
high existing burdens from zinc and iron deficiencies, thereby increasing existing global
inequalities in nutritional deficiency by disproportionately affecting South-East Asia and
Africa.
Our study suggests that climate mitigation strategies such as the Paris Agreement would be
expected to avert a greater portion (approximately 48%) of the projected increase in zinc and
iron deficiencies, about 1.8 times greater than the mitigation from traditional public health
interventions including nutrient supplementation and disease control programs to counteract
the heightened risk of diseases associated with zinc and iron deficiencies. A 48.2% reduction in
DALY burden due to reduced zinc and iron concentrations of crops with the climate mitiga-
tion strategy is reasonable, as the climate mitigation strategy reduces the increase in 2050 car-
bon dioxide concentrations by approximately 47%, and a linear relationship between carbon
dioxide concentrations and plant micronutrient concentrations was assumed. However, this
linear relationship need not be the case and is not an obvious result due to potential nonlinear-
ities created by relationships between micronutrient supplies, deficiencies, diseases, and result-
ing DALY burdens.
Our study extends prior work projecting changes in the zinc and iron concentrations of
crops due to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, changes in the prevalence of zinc defi-
ciencies, and countries at risk from the changing iron concentrations of crops (by computing
changes in iron supplies and cross-referencing them to estimates of the current prevalence of
anemia) [2–5,9,20]. We extended this body of work by modeling diseases stemming from zinc
and iron deficiencies using a microsimulation model to project disease burdens attributable to
the nutrient concentration effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and to evaluate
potential mitigation strategies. Critically, this approach enabled us to understand this impor-
tant health impact of climate change in the context of existing disease burdens and health
inequalities between countries and regions.
Among the primary limitations of our analysis is our inability to anticipate what changes in
dietary patterns might occur simultaneously with increasing carbon dioxide concentrations.

 We varied consumption parameters over wide ranges in sensitivity analysis and found that our
findings of an overall increased inequality in disease burden between countries and the impact
of climate mitigation relative to public health measures were consistent across a broad range of
scenarios. This is an important area for further research. Another limitation is that we assumed
that secular exponential trends in disease mortality rates would continue, reflecting economic
development and health services improvement. Should recent trends not continue in positive
directions, our projections may be viewed as optimistic, rendering our results conservative
forecasts of the complications from zinc and iron deficiencies. A third limitation is that we
assumed that crop zinc and iron concentrations decline linearly with increasing carbon diox-
ide concentrations. If the declines are convex, our disease burden projections are likely under-
estimates, while if they are concave, our disease burden projections are likely overestimates.
Finally, because we used WtdEARs to project deficiencies, we felt that disaggregating results
by gender and age group would imply a level of precision we cannot reliably provide at this
point.
Future studies may directly experiment with interventions to induce higher zinc and iron
concentrations in plants that can be grown in the most heavily affected countries. Further
studies should also evaluate whether dietary changes may be directed to reduce the burden of
disease associated with nutritional deficiency attributable to increased carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere. Finally, subsequent studies might seek to evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness
of different mitigation strategies.
While such studies are underway, our findings indicate that rising atmospheric carbon
dioxide concentrations and their impacts on nutrient concentrations in crops are likely to
increase health inequalities from nutritional deficiencies by disproportionately impacting
countries with the highest existing health burdens attributable to nutritional deficiencies. This
projected increase in health inequalities is driven by differences in existing vulnerability of
populations marginally above the threshold for deficiency and associated disease risk. Mitiga-
tion strategies concordant with the Paris Agreement, however, would be anticipated to sub-
stantially reduce the carbon-dioxide-induced rise in zinc and iron deficiency burdens, as
compared to traditional public health measures, which may have a lesser effect even with opti-
mistic degrees of population coverage and efficacy.
