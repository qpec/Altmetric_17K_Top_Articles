In Brief
The signals regulating immunity at the
gingiva, a key oral barrier, remain unclear.
Dutzan et al. show that oral barrier Th17
cells are induced in response to
mastication rather than commensal
colonization, identifying physiologic
mechanical damage as a unique tissue-
specific cue conditioning local immunity
and inflammation at the oral barrier.

SUMMARY
Immuno-surveillance networks operating at barrier
sites are tuned by local tissue cues to ensure effec-
tive immunity. Site-specific commensal bacteria
provide key signals ensuring host defense in the
skin and gut. However, how the oral microbiome
and tissue-specific signals balance immunity and
regulation at the gingiva, a key oral barrier, remains
minimally explored. In contrast to the skin and gut,
we demonstrate that gingiva-resident T helper 17
(Th17) cells developed via a commensal coloni-
zation-independent mechanism. Accumulation of
Th17 cells at the gingiva was driven in response to
the physiological barrier damage that occurs during
mastication. Physiological mechanical damage, via
induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6) from epithelial cells,
tailored effector T cell function, promoting increases
in gingival Th17 cell numbers. These data highlight
that diverse tissue-specific mechanisms govern edu-
cation of Th17 cell responses and demonstrate that
mechanical damage helps define the immune tone
of this important oral barrier.
INTRODUCTION
Barrier-resident immune populations integrate local cues to
generate responses that preserve barrier integrity, maintain
host-commensal interactions, and aid in fighting infection
(Cash et al., 2006; Franchi et al., 2012). In recent years our under-
standing of barrier-tailoring of immune responses has dramati-
cally expanded. This is particularly true in the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract and skin, where tissue-specific and microbial-derived
signals have been shown to shape the immune surveillance
network and immune responsiveness (Ivanov et al., 2009; Naik
et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013). Yet, little is known regarding
the development of tissue-specific immunity at the gingiva, an
essential oral barrier that supports the dentition, harbors a com-
plex commensal microbiome, and is a site where food antigens
are first encountered prior to GI tract entry. Indeed, how effective
immunity and regulation are balanced at this oral barrier is poorly
understood. Expanding our understanding of the basic mecha-
nisms controlling immunity at this barrier is important because
the breakdown of controlled immune responses at the gingiva
leads to periodontitis, a common inflammatory disease of
humans. Additionally, periodontitis has been linked to the poten-
tiation of a plethora of inflammatory conditions, such as cardio-
vascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis (Hajishengallis, 2015).
Therefore, understanding the mediators of health and disease at
the gingiva may have broad-reaching implications for systemic
inflammation.
T helper 17 (Th17) cells are key mediators of barrier immunity,
participating in immune surveillance and maintenance of barrier
integrity (Weaver et al., 2013). Importantly, this T cell subset has
been implicated in mediating protective immunity as well as
pathogenic inflammation at the oral barrier. The development
of Th17-cell-mediated responses at barriers such as the skin
and GI tract is linked to tissue-specific factors, particularly colo-
nization by site-specific commensals (Ivanov et al., 2009; Naik
et al., 2012). However, in the gingiva the factors controlling tis-
sue-specific immunity remain ill defined, and as such it is not
known how Th17 cells are induced in this environment. The crit-
ical role of Th17 cells in mediating protection at the oral barrier is

 evident in patients with genetic defects in Th17 cell differentia-
tion and function; these patients present with severe and recur-
rent oral fungal infections (Liu et al., 2011; Moutsopoulos et al.,
2015). However, exaggerated Th17 cell responses at the gingiva
are detrimental and have been shown to promote inflammatory
bone loss and tissue damage in periodontitis (Eskan et al.,
2012; Moutsopoulos et al., 2014). How Th17 cells are induced
in the gingiva and subsequently become deregulated in peri-
odontitis is poorly understood. Therefore, elucidating the factors
involved in the induction and regulation of Th17 cells in this envi-
ronment will shed light on the tissue-specific cues that regulate
immunity in the gingiva.
Here we delineated the mechanisms controlling accumulation
of Th17 cells in the gingiva. Our data show that the gingival inter-
leukin 17 (IL-17)-producing CD4+ T cell population increased
with age. Exploring this increase in Th17 cells in older mice, we
found that the mechanisms controlling CD4+ T cell effector func-
tion in the gingiva were different to those operating at other bar-
rier sites. Our data demonstrate that gingival Th17 cells were not
dependent on colonization by commensal bacteria, as the Th17
cell population was unchanged in germ-free mice. However,
gingival Th17 cells were dependent upon IL-6-mediated signals.
We identified that mechanical damage, which induces IL-6 and
occurs physiologically in the oral cavity through mastication
and abrasion, promoted accumulation of gingival Th17 cells.
Thus, damage, as opposed to commensal colonization, helps
define the immune tone of the gingiva, clearly demonstrating
that unique rules shape gingival immune-homeostasis.
RESULTS
Gingiva Th17 Cell Frequencies Increase with Age
In order to understand local induction of Th17 cell responses, we
examined IL-17+ T cells in mouse gingiva, the mucosal tissue
surrounding the dentition and key oral barrier in periodontitis.
At steady-state Th17 cells are enriched at barrier sites, specif-
ically the GI tract and skin (Ivanov et al., 2008; Naik et al.,
2012). In contrast, few Th17 cells were seen in the gingiva of
8-week-old (young) mice (Figure 1A). However by 24 weeks of
age, considered middle age in aging studies, Th17 cell fre-
quencies (Figures 1B and 1C) and numbers (Figure 1D) were
significantly elevated in the gingiva, indicating the physiologic
development of a Th17 cell network with age.
This increase in Th17 cells at 24 weeks was specific to the
gingiva and was not seen at other barriers, the oral-draining
lymph node, or spleen (Figure 1E). This age-dependent expan-
sion was also unique to Th17 cells, as gingiva from 24-week-
old mice exhibited reduced frequencies, although not total
numbers, of interferon g (IFN-g)-producing T cells (Figures 1B
and 1C) and an unchanged regulatory T (Treg) cell network (Fig-
ure 1F). Therefore, unlike other barrier sites, the gingiva showed
a remodelled cytokine network during aging. This natural, age-
driven increase in Th17 cells provided the ideal setting for us to
probe the development of disease-relevant gingival Th17 cells.
We first determined that these cells required antigen for their
development, as they were absent in 24-week-old T cell receptor
(TCR)-transgenic animals (Figure S1A). Next we assessed
whether enhanced proliferation or survival of Th17 cells could
be contributing to the enlarged gingival Th17 cell population
with age. Staining of gingiva Th17 cells from 8- and 24-week
old mice for the proliferation marker Ki67 and the anti-apoptotic
marker B cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) showed that increased prolif-
eration, not survival, contributed to the enlarged gingival Th17
cell population that emerged with age (Figure 1G).
We extended these observations to human gingiva by evalu-
ating IL-17+ cell frequencies in younger (18–25 years of age)
and older (40–50 years of age) healthy volunteers with no evi-
dence of periodontitis (Eke et al., 2012) or other oral disease (Fig-
ure S1B). We saw increased frequencies of IL-17+ cells in the
gingiva of older compared to younger adults (Figures 1H–1J).
No increases in IFN-g+ cells were seen (Figure S1C), and thus
our data demonstrated an age-dependent, gingival-specific
expansion of Th17 cells.
Shifts in Microbial Communities Do Not Correlate with
Th17 Cell Development
Commensal communities shape tissue immunity in health and
disease and specific oral microbes are implicated in the develop-
ment of not only periodontitis (Abusleme et al., 2013; Griffen
et al., 2012) but also distinct peripheral pathologies (Koren
et al., 2011; Kostic et al., 2012). Commensal bacteria play vital
roles in Th17 cell development at other barriers (Naik et al.,
2012), with specific species driving Th17 cell development
(Ivanov et al., 2009). Therefore, we first investigated whether
changes in oral microbial communities could account for
elevated gingival Th17 cells with age. We found no significant dif-
ferences in bacterial biomass, diversity, or composition in mice
at 8 versus 24 weeks of age (Figures 2A–2D). These data allowed
us to undertake a detailed examination of the mouse oral micro-
biome, revealing Firmicutes as the dominant phylum (Figure 2B)
and Lactobacillus having the most abundant operational taxo-
nomic units (OTUs) in the oral cavity (Figure 2C). Importantly,
some OTUs detected in lower abundance were closely related
to ‘‘signature’’ species of the human oral microbiome (Aas
et al., 2005; Abusleme et al., 2013), including Veillonella dispar,
Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces
oris, suggesting conserved oral microbiome elements in humans
and mice.
Next, we specifically interrogated the presence of segmented
filamentous bacteria (SFB), which promote generation of Th17
cells in the GI tract (Ivanov et al., 2009). These key Th17-cell-
driving bacteria were not constituents of the oral microbiome (Fig-
ure 2E). However, GI colonization by SFB can support Th17 cell
generation at peripheral sites (Lee et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010).
Therefore we examined Th17 cells in the gingiva of 24-week-old
SFB+ mice from Taconic (Tac) and SFB� mice from Jackson Lab-
oratories (Jax). No difference in the frequencies of gingival Th17
cells in SFB+ and SFB� micewere seen (Figure 2F), demonstrating
that gingival Th17 cell development was independent of SFB.
Moreover, despite similar Th17 cell frequencies, Tac and Jax
mice had significant differences in their oral bacterial communities
(Figures 2G and S2), further suggesting that the oral microbiome
may not be a primary driver of gingival Th17 cell development.
Gingival Th17 Cells Arise Independently of Commensal
Colonization
To fully evaluate the role of commensal bacteria in promoting
gingival Th17 cells, we examined these cells in age-matched

 germ-free (GF) and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice. In the
skin and GI tract, barrier-resident Th17 cells are dramatically
reduced in GF mice (Ivanov et al., 2009; Naik et al., 2012),
demonstrating that at these barriers Th17 cells are dependent
upon commensal bacteria colonization. However, this was not
the case in the gingiva, where similar frequencies and total
numbers of Th17 cells were seen in both GF and SPF mice (Fig-
ures 3A, 3B, and S3A). This differed from what was seen in the GI
tract (Figure 3C) and shows that in contrast to other barrier sites,
Th17 cell accumulation in the gingiva occurred independently of
bacterial colonization.
Accumulation of Th17 cells at the gingiva also did not occur in
response to fungal recognition, as gingival Th17 cells were un-
changed in the absence of Dectin-1 and Mannose receptor
signaling (Figures S3B and S3C). Broader evaluation of the im-
mune signatures of GF and SPF gingiva revealed that expression
of genes known to affect Th17 cell generation (e.g., tgfb1 and
il1b), downstream of IL-17 (e.g., s100a9, s100a8, csf2), and
part of the IL-17 signature (e.g., rorc, il17a) were similarly ex-
pressed in SPF and GF gingiva (Figure 3D). Frequencies of
CD45+ cells and T cells in the gingiva were also unchanged in
GF mice compared to control mice (Figure S3D). Moreover, the
frequencies of gingival Treg cells were similar in GF and SPF
mice (Figure S3E).
In sum our data show that, in contrast to other barrier sites,
bacterial colonization was not required to promote the physi-
ological accumulation of Th17 cells in the gingiva, highlighting
that unique factors ensure that Th17 cells populate this
barrier.
Gingival Th17 Cells Are Dependent upon IL-6
Next we sought to determine the cytokine cues required for
accumulation of gingival Th17 cells. We first examined a role
for IL-1 and IL-23, cytokines that promote the Th17 cell pheno-
type in naive CD4+ T cells (Harrington et al., 2005; McGeachy
et al., 2009) and are key for the development and maintenance
of Th17 cells in the GI tract and skin (Coccia et al., 2012; Naik
et al., 2012; Shaw et al., 2012). IL-1 and IL-23 were dispensable
for gingival Th17 cells (Figures 4A, 4B, S4A, and S4B) as shown
by the fact cytokine-deficient animals, specifically il1a/b�/� (il1a
and il1b double-deficient mice; Figure 4A) and il1r1�/� (Fig-
ure S4A) as well as il23a�/� (Figure 4B) and il12b�/� (Figure S4B)
mice exhibited unchanged frequencies of gingival Th17 cells.
IL-6 also promotes Th17 cell differentiation (Bettelli et al.,
2006; Mangan et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2006). We found
that development of gingival Th17 cells was dependent on IL-6
as Th17 cells were drastically reduced in the gingiva of il6-defi-
cient animals (Figure 4C). To understand whether the require-
ment for IL-6 signals was intrinsic or extrinsic to T cells, we
generated mixed bone marrow chimeras by combining congeni-
cally marked wild-type and Il6ra�/� (lacking expression of the IL-
6R) bone marrow. Examining gingiva CD4+IL-17+ T cells in these
chimeras demonstrated that gingival T cells had a cell-intrinsic
requirement for IL-6 signaling to produce IL-17, as Il6ra�/�
CD4+ T cells in the gingiva did not make IL-17 but wild-type
CD4+ T cells in the same environment did (Figures 4D and 4E).
In contrast, both wild-type and Il6ra�/� CD4+ T cells in the skin
and GI tract of these chimeras could make IL-17 (Figure S4C).
These data indicate that distinct signals support Th17 cells
in the gingiva compared to those in operation at other barrier
sites, with Th17 cells accumulating in the gingiva indepen-
dently of commensal colonization and in an IL-6-dependent
manner.
Physiological Mechanical Damage Promotes Gingival
Th17 Cells
We next addressed how gingival Th17 cells could develop inde-
pendently of endogenous commensal bacteria. A unique tissue-
specific signal present in the oral environment is on-going masti-
cation. Mastication requires mechanical force and leads to local
barrier abrasion and damage. We queried whether mastication
was a physiologic stimulus contributing to the tailoring of gingival
T cell function. We addressed this by altering levels of these
stimuli and then examining gingival Th17 cells. First, we reduced
the mechanical forces of mastication on the oral barrier by
placing weanling mice on nutritionally matched soft diets. Mice
remained on this diet until 24 weeks of age when gingiva Th17
cells were assessed. Reduction in the physiological stimuli
induced by mastication resulted in a significant decrease in
gingiva Th17 cells (Figures 5A and S5A). This occurred specif-
ically in the gingiva and not in the local draining lymph node (Fig-
ure S5B), suggesting that mastication locally supports gingival
Th17 cells.
To directly assess whether local barrier damage was a stim-
ulus promoting gingival Th17 cells, we increased the levels of
damage at the gingiva of young mice, in which few Th17 cells
were seen (Figure 1). Gingival damage was enhanced by
increasing levels of barrier abrasion, through rubbing of the
gingiva with a sterile cotton applicator once every other day for
11 days. This direct induction of mechanical damage resulted
in increased frequencies (Figure 5B) and numbers (Figure S5C)
of gingival Th17 cells. Th17 cell increases were not seen in
Figure 2. Microbiome Shifts Do Not Correlate with the Presence of Gingival Th17 Cells

 draining lymph nodes, further underscoring the compartmental-
ized nature of this response (Figure S5D).
We next wanted to understand the mechanism(s) by which
gingival damage promoted increases in the number of gingival
barrier Th17 cells. We assessed whether the increased gingival
Th17 cells were due to elevated IL-17+ T cell recruitment, prolif-
eration, or survival. In line with our data from aged mice, where
damage occurs physiologically over time due to mastication
(Figure 1G), in our damage-induction model, gingival IL-
17+CD4+ T cells showed greater proliferation but no change in
pro-survival factor expression (Figure 5C). To examine whether
elevated recruitment of Th17 cells after damage could also
play a role, we transferred in vitro differentiated Th17 and Th0

cells and examined Th17 cell recruitment
to the gingiva. Th17 cells were not re-
cruited to the gingiva to a greater degree
than Th0 cells either before or after dam-
age (Figures S5E and S5F). These data,
along with data demonstrating that the
lymph node egress inhibitor FTY720 did
not alter the gingival Th17 cell population
after damage (Figure 5D), suggested that
elevated recruitment did not contribute
to the increased gingival Th17 cell fre-
quencies arising after damage. Com-
bined, our data indicate that damage pro-
motes the proliferation of gingival IL-17+
T cells.
Next we determined whether damage-
induced expansion of gingival Th17 cells
required antigen recognition. We found
that increased frequencies of gingival
Th17 cells were not seen in response to
damage in the absence of cognate anti-
gen, demonstrating a requirement for
both damage and antigen in promoting
an enlarged population of gingival Th17
cells (Figure 5E). In response to gingival damage, il6�/� animals
failed to show an increased population of gingival Th17 cells (Fig-
ure 5F), outlining a vital role for IL-6 in this damage-induced pro-
cess. Combined, our data demonstrate that local physiological
mechanical damage to the gingiva modulates the gingival barrier
T cell network, promoting Th17 cells in an IL-6- and antigen-
dependent manner.
Although mechanical damage occurs physiologically at the
gingiva, we queried whether repeated damage to other barriers
could promote increases in local Th17 cells. We show this was
the case after repeated skin damage (Figure S5G), revealing
the activity of this pathway even at a site where Th17 cells are
dominantly educated by commensals.

 Gingiva Damage Rapidly Induces IL-6 from Epithelial
Cells in a Commensal-Independent Manner
Consistent with the IL-6 dependency of gingiva Th17 cells, IL-6
was elevated in the gingiva after mechanical damage (Figure 6A).
Next we identified the cellular source of IL-6 after damage by
initially FACS sorting gingival CD45� and CD45+ cells. Only
CD45� cells showed increased il6 mRNA levels after damage
(Figure S6A). To define the source of IL-6, we FACS purified
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, as well as re-
maining CD45� cells and CD45+ cells, after gingival damage
(Figure S6B). In response to damage, il6 transcription was
elevated only in epithelial cells (Figure 6B). This damage-induced
IL-6 from epithelial cells appeared to be a conserved response
(Zhang et al., 2015), as we saw increased il6 messenger RNA
(mRNA) and protein after damage of human oral epithelial cells
(HOK cells) in vitro (Figure 6C).
Consistent with an IL-6-dependent development of gingival
Th17 cells, levels of il6 mRNA in bulk gingival CD45� cells corre-
lated with Th17 cell frequencies, with higher expression levels in
24- versus 8-week-old mice, and similar expression levels in
gingival CD45� cells from age-matched GF and SPF mice (Fig-
ures S6C and S6D).
Increased il6 expression occurred rapidly within 1 hr of barrier
damage (Figures 6D and S6E). Moreover, transcriptomic anal-
ysis of immune genes upregulated within 1 hr of gingival damage
revealed that il6 was the most highly upregulated gene (Figures
6D and 6E). Pathway analysis of array data from in vivo damaged
gingival tissue and in vitro damaged human oral keratinocytes
showed activation of the IL-6-signaling pathway, as well as the
NF-kB-signaling pathway, which is implicated in il6 transcription
(Figure S6F; Libermann and Baltimore, 1990). Inhibition of NF-kB
signaling in vitro led to a reduced upregulation of il6 mRNA after
damage, suggesting some role for NF-kB in damage-induced il6
activation (Figure S6G).
Finally, we queried whether rapid il6 upregulation after gingival
damage was influenced by commensal bacteria. Increases in il6
mRNA after damage were seen in both SPF and GF animals and
were increased to the same extent in both sets of mice (Fig-
ure 6F). Combined, these data demonstrate that local mechani-
cal damage to the gingiva induces rapid production of IL-6 from
epithelial cells, which is subsequently vital for gingival Th17 cells.
Damage-Induced Responses Contribute to Protective
Immunity and Inflammation at the Gingiva
Our data suggested that gingiva mechanical damage was the
major driver promoting the accumulation of Th17 cells. As the
gingiva is an environment experiencing constant physiological
mechanical damage from mastication, we hypothesized that
physiologic damage could be a key local cue promoting induc-
tion of barrier protective responses. To test this, we induced bar-
rier damage by gingival abrasion and examined IL-17-induced
barrier defense mechanisms 5–10 days after abrasion. Gingival
damage was sufficient to drive elevated expression of epithelial
defensins and neutrophil chemo-attractants (Figure 7A) and led
to increased neutrophils in the gingiva (Figure 7B) and local
lymph node (Figure S7A). Induction of these responses was sus-
tained after il6 transcripts in CD45� cells had returned to control
levels (Figure S7B). Moreover, induction of this barrier protective
program was IL-17 dependent; it was not seen after gingival
damage of il17a�/� mice (Figure S7C). These data collectively
suggested that damage-induced Th17 cell responses promote
immune surveillance of the gingival tissue environment.
While mechanical damage-induced Th17 cells could mediate
a degree of barrier protection, as Th17 cells are associated
with periodontal bone loss we speculated that long-term expo-
sure to these immune mediators could be detrimental and
mediate pathogenic consequences at the gingiva. We measured
periodontal bone heights (cement-enamel junction [CEJ] to alve-
olar bone crest [ABC] distances) and documented periodontal
bone loss in 24- compared to 8-week-old mice (Figure 7C), sug-
gesting a negative consequence of the damage-induced remod-
eling of the gingiva cytokine network with age. Moreover, this
negative consequence was mediated by IL-17, as reduced
bone loss was seen in 24-week-old il17a�/� mice (Figure 7D).
We found that physiological mechanical damage was a key
driver of this bone loss. We decreased the levels of damage at
the gingiva by feeding mice nutritionally matched soft diet from
weaning until 24 weeks of age. Reduction in mastication-
induced damage resulted in significantly less alveolar bone
loss compared to mice fed normal chow (Figure 7E), outlining a
key role for damage-induced Th17 cells in this bone loss.
Undertaking complimentary experiments, we also placed wean-
ling mice on a hardened irradiated diet, where pellets are harder
than normal chow, resulting in increased damage from mastica-
tion. Contrasting the mice placed on softer diets, mice on hard
diet had elevated frequencies of gingival Th17 cells (Figure S7D).
Moreover, these animals exhibited increased bone loss by
24 weeks of age, which was prevented by administration of
anti-IL-17 (Figure 7F).
Increased bone loss with age was seen even in GF mice (Fig-
ure 7G). 24-week-old GF and SPF mice had similar levels of bone
loss, yet when animals were aged to 18 months, bone loss was
decreased in GF compared to SPF mice (Figure S7E), under-
scoring the role of microbe-dependent and -independent factors
in driving periodontal bone loss with age.
By promoting Th17 cell effector responses, physiological
damage to the gingiva emerges as a key local cue tailoring bar-
rier immuno-surveillance and defense. However, as Th17 cells
also promote periodontitis and alveolar bone destruction,
gingival mechanical damage also has pathological conse-
quences, promoting elevated bone loss.
DISCUSSION
Collectively, our data delineate tissue-specific cues responsible
for supporting gingival Th17 cells, revealing that unique mecha-
nisms govern CD4+ T cell education at this barrier compared to
others. Th17 cells are enriched at barriers where they mediate
key protective roles (Ivanov et al., 2009; Naik et al., 2012). How-
ever, here we have shown that in health few Th17 cells patrol the
gingiva in both young adult mice and humans. Nevertheless, this
Th17 cell population expanded in the gingiva with age. Although
increased Th17 cell differentiation has been reported for T cells
from elderly humans and mice (Ouyang et al., 2011), elevated fre-
quencies of gingival Th17 cells occurred by 24 weeks of age, an
earlier time point than previously examined and, importantly, one
at which increased Th17 cells were not seen at any other site

(A) At day 11 after gingival damage, il6 expression was determined by qPCR in dissected gingival tissues of young mice. il6 expression is shown for samples from
mice experiencing damage relative to that in control gingiva. Graph represents data from five mice/group.
(B) CD45+ and different populations of CD45� cells were FACS sorted from the gingiva of control mice (white bars) or mice that experienced gingival damage 4 hr
prior (black bars). Sorted populations were CD45+ cells, endothelial cells (CD45�CD31+), fibroblasts (CD45�CD31�EpCAM�CD140a+), and epithelial cells
(CD45�CD31�EpCAM+). Bar graphs show il6 expression determined by qPCR and is shown in cells sorted from damaged gingiva relative to that in controls. Data

 examined, highlighting a specific expansion of this CD4+ T cell
fate in the gingiva.
The altered gingival CD4+ T cell network that emerged by
24 weeks of age led us to first hypothesize that altered
commensal bacteria could be driving increased numbers of
Th17 cells in older mice. In the GI tract and skin, development
of Th17 cells is dependent upon commensal colonization and,
as such, in GF animals Th17 cells are dramatically reduced at
these sites (Ivanov et al., 2009; Naik et al., 2012). Furthermore,
Th17 cells in the GI tract have been shown to be commensal spe-
cific (Yang et al., 2014) and therefore bacteria are vital for
ensuring that Th17 cells seed these other sites. We have been
able to undertake a detailed examination of the oral microbiome
of mice and found no significant differences in bacterial biomass,
diversity, or composition between young mice lacking gingival
Th17 cells and older mice with gingival Th17 cells. Bacterial me-
tabolites have been shown to modulate CD4+ T cell differentia-
tion (Atarashi et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2013), so it remained
possible that commensal-mediated effects would not be visible
at a species level. Therefore, to fully understand the contribution
of commensal bacteria to gingival Th17 cells, we examined GF
mice. We demonstrated that gingiva Th17 cells were present in
GF animals, outlining that a commensal colonization-indepen-
dent mechanism must ensure their accumulation. These data
differ from that at other barriers and suggested that unique
mechanisms operate in the gingiva to control CD4+ T cell effector
function. Indeed, alongside Th17 cells, commensal colonization
did not affect gingival Treg cell frequencies, which is again
different from other barriers. Our data contrasted what has
been reported for Th17 cell development in the tongue, a phys-
iologically distinct barrier in the oral cavity (Conti et al., 2014).
Tongue-resident Th17 cells develop in a commensal-dependent
manner, further highlighting the novel pathways of gingival CD4+
T cell education.
Having demonstrated that gingiva Th17 cells develop inde-
pendently of commensal colonization, we sought to understand
the cues driving differentiation of these disease-relevant cells.
Induction of the Th17 cell fate is driven by the cytokines trans-
forming growth factor beta (TGF-b), IL-1b, IL-23, and IL-6 (Bet-
telli et al., 2006; Harrington et al., 2005; Mangan et al., 2006;
Veldhoen et al., 2006). Again contrasting other barrier sites, we
showed that gingival Th17 cells develop in the absence of IL-1
signaling. Key roles for IL-1 in supporting the development and
maintenance of Th17 cells have been shown in both the skin
and GI tract (Coccia et al., 2012; Naik et al., 2012; Shaw et al.,
2012). Yet it is likely the IL-1 at these sites is produced in
response to the microbiota (Naik et al., 2012; Seo et al., 2015).
Subsequently, we determined that IL-6 signals were vital for
gingival Th17 cell development. IL-6 is not required for Th17
cell development in the skin (Naik et al., 2012) and this has
also been suggested for the GI tract (Shaw et al., 2012). How-
ever, a role for IL-6 in GI Th17 cell development has been re-
ported (Persson et al., 2013). Yet, this study demonstrated that
CD11b+CD103+ dendritic cells were the key source of IL-6,
whereas our data showed that epithelial cells were an important
gingival source of this cytokine, again indicating a differential
control of Th17 cell development. Our data from mixed bone
marrow chimeras, utilizing wild-type and il6ra�/� bone marrow,
further highlighted that IL-6 signals were vital for IL-17 produc-
tion by gingival CD4+ T cells.
To elucidate the stimulus capable of driving gingival Th17 cell
accumulation in the absence of endogenous microbiota, we
queried which signals present in the oral environment could sup-
port acquisition of the Th17 cell fate. A unique, tissue-specific
signal in the oral environment is on-going mastication. We
demonstrated that this physiological damage participated in
the expansion of gingival Th17 cells in an antigen- and IL-6-
dependent manner. We suggest that mechanical damage due
to mastication, over the period of 24 weeks, led to sufficient
levels of IL-6 to promote elevated frequencies of gingival Th17
cells. Mechano-sensing by cells triggers multiple cellular re-
sponses; indeed, mechanical stretch promotes a pro-inflamma-
tory response from a plethora of cells including osteoblasts,
fibroblasts, and endothelial and epithelial cells. This pro-inflam-
matory response includes IL-6 production (Fukuno et al., 2011;
Kobayashi et al., 2003; Skutek et al., 2001). Our data show activ-
ity of a similar pathway in the gingiva where epithelial cells pro-
duce IL-6 in response to mechanical damage. As this IL-6 affects
T cell fate, we consequently have outlined a novel tissue-specific
cue shaping CD4+ T cell function at a barrier site.
Here we have also demonstrated that local damage not only
promotes Th17 cells but also contributes to the potentiation
and exacerbation of local oral immunity. In young mice, pres-
ence of damage-induced gingival Th17 cells led to elevated bar-
rier protective responses including increased anti-microbial pep-
tides and neutrophil chemo-attractants, suggesting that damage
is a physiologic cue shaping homeostatic immunity at this bar-
rier. However, although physiologic damage enhanced barrier
protective mechanisms, we also show that with age, these
elevated responses can have a detrimental effect. Both elevated
Th17 cells and neutrophils (Eskan et al., 2012; Moutsopoulos
et al., 2014) are causative in periodontitis, as are dysbiotic micro-
bial communities that stimulate aberrant inflammatory re-
sponses promoting the disease in mouse models (Hajishengallis
et al., 2011) and in susceptible patients (Darveau, 2010; Lamont
and Hajishengallis, 2015). Our data show that gingival mechan-
ical damage acts as an amplifier of this oral inflammatory
response and contributes to pathogenic bone loss. Consistent

 with this concept, we demonstrated that age-induced bone loss
can be altered by modulating levels of mastication. This concept
of mastication-induced damage contributing to Th17-cell-driven
bone loss with age can conceivably be translated in the human
setting. In humans, physiologic damage from mastication is an
on-going stimulus that could potentially be a contributing factor
to the age-related Th17 cell increase we observe and progres-
sion to periodontitis, a disease occurring at higher incidence
with age. In fact, it has been clinically observed, and shown in an-
imal models, that elevated mechanical damage from biting,
known as occlusal forces (Hallmon, 1999), leads to increased
periodontal bone loss in settings of periodontitis, a phenomenon
termed ‘‘secondary trauma from occlusion’’ (Lindhe and Svan-
berg, 1974; Polson et al., 1976). Our data provide a biological
basis for these clinical observations, identifying mechanical
damage as a tissue-specific cue supporting Th17 cell re-
sponses, which can exaggerate periodontal bone loss.
In sum, although a full understanding of host-commensal
cross-talk in calibrating steady-state immunity in the gingiva re-
mains to be determined, here we demonstrate a commensal
colonization-independent mechanism supporting Th17 cells in
the gingiva; this starkly contrasts developmental requirements
for these cells at other barrier sites. Instead, gingival mechanical
damage promoted the proliferation of Th17 cells, highlighting
physiological damage as a key local cue tailoring immuno-sur-
veillance at this barrier. These data provide insight into tissue
training of immunity at the gingiva, outlining that different signals
dominate in tailoring immune responses at distinct barrier sites
and suggesting unique ways to modulate pathogenic gingival
Th17 cell responses.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
C57BL/6, il1r1�/�, OT-IIxrag�/�, il17a�/�, and il12b�/� mice were from Taconic
or the NIAID-Taconic exchange. C57BL/6 mice were also purchased from the
Jackson Laboratory or Harlan. Other gene-deficient animals were il23a�/�
(from G. Trinchieri at NCI, NIH), il6�/� (from S. Anderton at University of Edin-
burgh), il1a/b�/�(Horai et al., 1998), and il6ra�/� (from S. Jones at University of
Cardiff). Germ-free mice were from the University of Manchester Gnotobiotic
Facility, the NIAID Microbiome Project Gnotobiotic Animal Facility, the NCI
Gnotobiotic Animal Facility at Frederick, or the University of McMaster Germ
Free Facility. All experiments were approved by appropriate governing bodies
and performed according to local rules.
Human Samples
All subjects signed informed consent and enrolled on an IRB-approved proto-
col (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01568697) at the NIH Clinical Center. For details on
patient inclusion, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S1B.
Generation of Mixed Bone Marrow Chimeras
Bone marrow from il6ra�/� and WT mice was T cell depleted using microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec). CD45.1+CD45.2+ animals were lethally irradiated and recon-
stituted with equal numbers of WT (CD45.1) and il6ra�/� (CD45.2) bone
marrow cells. After transfer, mice were aged to 24 weeks.
Preparation of Single-Cell Suspensions
For mice, gingiva was dissected and digested for 50 min at 37�C with Collage-
naseIV (GIBCO) and DNase (Sigma) as previously described (Dutzan et al.,
2016a). Single-cell suspensions were obtained from small intestinal lamina
propria after digestion at 37�C with Liberase TL (Roche) and from the skin
after digestion as previously described (Naik et al., 2012). For details on
tape-striping experiments, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures. For
humans, gingival biopsies were processed as previously described (Dutzan
et al., 2016b).
Flow Cytometry
Single-cell preparations were stained with antibodies from eBioscience, BD
Biosciences, and Biolegend. Cytokines, Foxp3, Ki67, and Bcl-2 were stained
using the eBioscience Fix/Perm kit. Cytokines were also stained in buffer con-
taining 0.5% Saponin (Sigma). Dead cells were excluded by use of a Live/Dead
fixable dye (Biolegend). Samples were acquired using a Fortessa (BD Biosci-
ences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar). Cell sorting was per-
formed using an Influx (BD Biosciences).
Ex Vivo Re-stimulation for Cytokine Detection
Cells were stimulated with 50 ng/mL PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 mg/mL iono-
mycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of GolgiPlug (Brefeldin A; BD Biosci-
ences). After 3.5–4 hr, cells were stained for flow cytometric analysis.
Real-Time RT-PCR
RNA was obtained from cells with an RNeasy Mini or Micro kit (QIAGEN) or
from gingival tissues using Trizol and cDNA synthesized with Superscript
reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Quantitative real-time
PCR was done with TaqMan primers/probes (Applied Biosystems) or with
SYBR green qPCR super mix (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Results were
normalized to hprt expression.
Oral Microbiome Evaluation via 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing
and qPCR
For microbiome analyses, the murine oral cavity was sampled for 30 s using
sterile
ultra-fine
swabs.
