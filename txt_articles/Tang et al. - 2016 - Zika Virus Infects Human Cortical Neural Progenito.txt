 The suspected link between infection by Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging flavivirus, and 
microcephaly is an urgent global health concern. The direct target cells of ZIKV in the developing 
human fetus are not clear. Here we show that a strain of the ZIKV MR766, serially passaged in 
monkey and mosquito cells, efficiently infects human cortical neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) 
derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Infected hNPCs further release infectious ZIKV 
particles. Importantly, ZIKV infection increases cell death and dysregulates cell cycle progression, 
resulting in attenuated hNPC growth. Global gene expression analysis of infected hNPCs reveals 
transcriptional dysregulation, notably of cell cycle-related pathways. Our results identify human 
cortical neural precursor cells as a direct ZIKV target. In addition, we establish a tractable 
experimental model system to investigate the impact and mechanism of ZIKV on human brain 
development and provide a platform to screen therapeutic compounds.
Graphical Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flaviviruss, is now reported to be circulating in 26 
countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean (Petersen et al., 2016). While 
infected individuals can often be asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, of mounting 
concern are reports linking ZIKV infection to fetal and newborn microcephaly and serious 
neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (Petersen et al., 2016). The 
World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 
February 1 of 2016 (Heymann et al., 2016). ZIKV infects human skin cells, consistent with 
its major transmission route (Hamel et al., 2015). ZIKV was detected in the amniotic fluid of 
two pregnant women whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly (Calvet et al., 
2016), suggesting that ZIKV can cross the placental barrier. ZIKV was also found in 
microcephalic fetal brain tissue (Mlakar et al., 2016). Because so little is known about direct 
cell targets and mechanisms of ZIKV, and access to fetal human brain tissue is limited, there 
is an urgent need to develop a new strategy to determine whether there is a causal 
relationship between ZIKV infection and microcephaly. Here we used human induced 
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as an in vitro model to investigate whether ZIKV directly 
infects human neural cells and the nature of its impact.

 We obtained a ZIKV stock from an infected rhesus Macaca cell line LLC-MK2. We 
passaged the virus in the mosquito C6/C36 cell line and titered collected ZIKV on Vero 
cells, an interferon-deficient monkey cell line commonly used to titer viruses. Sequences of 
multiple RT-PCR fragments generated from this stock (Figure S1A) matched the sequence 
of MR766, the original ZIKV strain that likely passed from an infected rhesus monkey to 
mosquitos (Dick et al., 1952). We first tested several human cell lines and found varying 
levels of susceptibility to ZIKV infection (Table S1). Notably, the human embryonic kidney 
cell line HEK293T showed low permissiveness for ZIKV infection (Figure S1C).
To identify direct target cells of ZIKV in the human neural lineage, we used an highly 
efficient protocol to differentiate hiPSCs into forebrain-specific human neural progenitor 
cells (hNPCs), which can be further differentiated into cortical neurons (Wen et al., 2014). 
The in vivo ZIKA concentration is currently unknown. We performed infections at a low 
multiplicity of infection (MOI < 0.1) and the medium containing virus inoculum was 
removed after a 2-hour incubation. Infection rates were then quantified 56 hours later with 
RT-PCR using MR766-specific primers (Figure S1A) and with immunocytochemistry using 
an anti-ZIKV envelope antibody (Figure 1A–B). The hNPCs were readily infected by ZIKV 
in vitro, with the infection spreading to 65–90% of the cells within three days of inoculation 
(Figure 1A, C). Quantitative analysis showed similar results for hNPCs derived from hiPSC 
lines of two different subjects (Figure 1C). As a control, we also exposed human embryonic 
stem cells (hESCs), hiPSCs, and immature cortical neurons to ZIKV under the same 
condition. hESCs and hiPSCs could also be infected by ZIKV, but the infection was limited 
to a few cells at the colony edge with reduced expression of the pluripotent marker NANOG 
(Figure 1C and S1D; Table S1). Immature neurons differentiated from hNPCs also exhibited 
lower levels of infection under our conditions (Figure 1B–C). Together, these results 
establish that hNPCs, a constitutive population of the developing embryonic brain, are a 
direct cell target of ZIKV.
ZIKV envelope immunostaining exhibited the characteristic intracellular “virus factory” 
pattern of flaviviruses (Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014) (Figure 1A). We therefore 
tested infectivity using supernatant from infected hNPCs and observed robust infection of 
Vero cells (Figure 1D), indicating that productive infection of hNPCs leads to efficient 
secretion of infectious ZIKV particles.
We next determined the potential impact of ZIKV infection on hNPCs. We found a 29.9 
+ 6.6% reduction in the total number of viable cells 66–72 hours after ZIKV infection, as 
compared to the mock infection (n = 3). Interestingly, ZIKV infection led to significantly 
higher caspase-3 activation in hNPCs 3 days after infection, as compared to the mock 
infection, suggesting increased cell death (Figure 2A–B). Furthermore, analysis of DNA 
content by flow cytometry suggested cell cycle perturbation of infected hNPCs (Figure 2C 
and S2A). Therefore, ZIKV infection of hNPCs leads to attenuated growth of this cell 
population that is due, at least partly, to both increased cell death and cell cycle 
dysregulation.
To investigate the impact of ZIKV infection on hNPCs at the molecular level, we employed 
global transcriptome analyses (RNA-seq). Our genome-wide analyses identified a large

 number of differentially expressed genes upon viral infection (Figure S2B and Table S2). 
Gene Ontology analyses revealed a particular enrichment of downregulated genes in cell 
cycle-related pathways (Figure 2D), which is consistent with our flow cytometry findings 
(Figure 2C). Upregulated genes were primarily enriched in transcription, protein transport 
and catabolic processes (Figure 2E). Consistent with increased caspase-3 activation observed 
by immunocytochemistry (Figure 2A–B), RNA-seq analysis revealed upregulation of genes 
involved in regulation of apoptotic pathway, including caspase-3 (Figure 2E). These global 
transcriptome datasets not only support our cell biology findings, but also provide a valuable 
resource for the field.
It is not known whether specific strains of ZIKV circulating in geographically diverse parts 
of the world differ in their ability to impact neural development and the stain we used had 
been discovered prior to the current reports of a potential epidemiologic link between ZIKV 
and microcephaly. Nevertheless, our results clearly demonstrate that ZIKV can directly 
infect human embryonic cortical neural precursor cells in vitro with high efficiency, and that 
infection of hNPCs leads to attenuated population growth through virally-induced caspase 3-
mediated apoptosis and cell cycle dysregulation. Infected hNPCs also release infectious viral 
particles, which presents a significant clinical challenge for developing effective therapeutics 
to arrest or block the impact of infection. Future studies using the hiPSC/hNPC model can 
determine whether various ZIKV strains impact hNPCs differently and, conversely, whether 
a single ZIKV strain differentially affects hNPCs from hiPSCs of various human 
populations.
Flaviviruses tend to have broad cellular tropisms and multiple factors contribute to 
pathogenic outcomes, including specific cellular response and tissue accessibility. Dengue 
virus infects cells of several lineages and hematopoietic cells play an essential role in the 
associated pathogenesis (Pham et al., 2012). West Nile virus infects epithelial cells of 
multiple tissues and can be neuroinvasive (Suthar et al., 2013). We note that ZIKV also 
infects other human cell types, including skin cells and fibroblasts (Hamel et al., 2015), and 
it remains unknown how ZIKV may gain access to the fetal brain (Mlakar et al., 2016). The 
capacity of ZIKV to infect hNPCs and attenuate their growth underscores the urgent need 
for more research into the role of these cells in putative ZIKV-related neuropathology. The 
finding that ZIKV also infects immature neurons raises critical questions about pathological 
effects on neurons and other neural cell types in the brain, as well as potential long-term 
consequences. Intriguingly, an early animal study showed ZIKV infection of neurons and 
astrocytes in mice and observed enlarged astrocytes (Bell et al., 1971). Our study also raises 
the question of whether ZIKV infects neural stem cells in adult humans (Bond et al., 2015).
In summary, our results fill a major gap in our knowledge about ZIKV biology and serve as 
an entry point to establish a mechanistic link between ZIKV and microcephaly. Our study 
also provides a tractable experimental system for modeling the impact of ZIKV on neural 
development and for investigating underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Of equal 
importance, our hNPC model and robust cellular phenotype comprise a readily scalable 
platform for high-throughput screens to prevent ZIKV infection of hNPCs and to ameliorate 
its pathological effects during neural development.
