Abstract
IMPORTANCE—An increasing percentage of births are conceived with assisted reproductive 
technology (ART) and other infertility treatment. Despite findings that such treatments may be 
associated with diminished gestation and birth size, scarce data exist regarding infertility 
treatments and children’s development in the United States.
OBJECTIVE—To assess the use and type of infertility treatment in relation to children’s 
development through age 36 months.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Prospective cohort study (conducted 2008–2014) 
that sampled based on infertility treatment and plurality. Included in the study were infants born 
between 2008 and 2010 in New York state (excluding New York City) whose parents completed 
developmental screening instruments through 36 months of age. A total of 4824 mothers (97%of 
4989) completed 1 or more developmental screening instruments for 5841 children, including 
1830 conceived with infertility treatment and 2074 twins.

 EXPOSURES—Maternal self-report of any infertility treatment was further categorized into 
ART and ovulation induction/intrauterine insemination. Assisted reproductive technology use was 
previously validated by linkage with the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology–Clinical 
Outcome Reporting System.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Five developmental domains (fine motor, gross 
motor, communication, personal-social functioning, and problem-solving ability), as measured by 
the parental completion of the Ages and Stages Questionnaires at 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 
months of age. Generalized linear mixed modeling techniques estimated adjusted odds ratios 
(aORs) and 95%CIs for use and type of infertility treatment in relation to failing a developmental 
domain. Data were stratified by plurality and weighted for the sampling scheme.
RESULTS—There were 1422 mothers (29.5%; mean [SD], age, 34.1 [5.2] years) who underwent 
infertility treatment. Infertility treatment was not associated with risk of their children failing any 
developmental domain (aOR, 1.33; 95%CI, 0.94–1.89). Assisted reproductive technology was 
associated with increased risk for failing any developmental domain but only when singletons and 
twins were evaluated together (aOR, 1.81; 95%CI, 1.21–2.72). Adjustment for birth weight further 
attenuated this estimate (aOR, 1.26; 95%CI, 0.82–1.93). After stratifying by plurality, type of 
treatment also was not significantly associated with failing any developmental domain for 
ovulation induction/intrauterine insemination (aOR, 1.00; 95%CI, 0.57–1.77 for singletons and 
aOR, 1.30; 95%CI, 0.76–2.21 for twins) or ART (aOR, 1.38; 95%CI, 0.78–2.43 for singletons and 
aOR, 1.58; 95%CI, 0.94–2.65 for twins).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—After considering plurality, children’s development 
through age 3 years was similar irrespective of infertility treatment or specific type. To our 
knowledge, these findings are among the first to focus on non-ART treatments in the United 
States.
Infertility treatment, including assisted reproductive technology (ART), has helped many 
people become parents.1,2 In 2011, 1.5%of US births were conceived with ART.1 
Conceptions by ovulation induction were estimated to be much higher, accounting for 3% to 
7% of US births.3,4
Concern about the neurodevelopment of children conceived with such modalities is 
longstanding, given the potential for developmental “programming” at any stage of 
treatment including in vitro culture5 and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).6 
Conception by fertility drugs may also be relevant owing to ovarian stimulation possibly 
impacting endometrium receptivity and placentation.7 Observations that children conceived 
by infertility treatment are born earlier and with lower birth weight add to concerns.8,9
Many studies, as reviewed elsewhere,10–12 have investigated neurodevelopmental outcomes 
with ART but the evidence remains equivocal and largely based on a few follow-up studies 
conducted outside of the United States. In Sweden, a small significant association with 18% 
higher risk for intellectual disabilities was found, driven by procedures with ICSI,6 whereas 
in Denmark, no association was observed.13 Other studies investigating cognitive or 
neuromotor function have largely found no difference.11 One linkage study from the United 
States observed an increased risk for autism associated with ART,14 which seemed largely

 due to socioeconomic differences in surveillance,15 and no significant associations were 
found in large registry studies from Scandinavia.6,13,16
Studies investigating non-ART infertility treatments and children’s development remain rare. 
One study found a small increased risk in any mental disorders for children conceived with 
ovulation induction (OI), with or without intrauterine insemination (IUI), relative to children 
conceived without any treatment using registry data from Denmark.13 These results 
contradict earlier studies from Finland,17 the United States,18 and the United Kingdom that 
found no differences with respect to children conceived by OI/IUI.19
In response to critical data gaps, we designed the Upstate KIDS Study to specifically assess 
the association between the mode of conception and children’s development through age 3 
years. Because ART technique differs between the United States and abroad (eg, including 
the number of embryos transferred or use of assisted hatching),20 our findings are 
particularly important for communicating with US couples seeking infertility treatment.
Methods
Study Design and Population
The Upstate KIDS Study recruited infants born to women delivering in New York state 
(excluding New York City) between 2008 and 2010.21 All infants whose birth certificates 
indicated infertility treatment use comprised the exposure cohort and their parents were 
invited to participate. All multiples were also invited to participate. Singletons not conceived 
with infertility treatment were recruited at a 3:1 ratio to the exposure cohort frequency 
matched on the state’s perinatal region of birth. In total, 5034 mothers (27%of 18 479 
approached) of 6171 children enrolled in the study, with higher response (32%) among 
exposed mothers.21 We have described recruitment and follow-up procedures, as well as 
demonstrated the validity of this sampling framework relative to birth certificate information 
and the absence of major differences in baseline characteristics by participation status.21 The 
New York State Department of Health and the University at Albany (State University of 
New York) institutional review boards approved the study and served as the institutional 
review boards designated by the National Institutes of Health under a reliance agreement. 
All parents provided written informed consent.
Infertility Treatment Exposure
At 4 months post partum, mothers selected all medical services or medications used to 
become pregnant on the questionnaire. Two subcategories of exposure were defined: (1) 
ART use consisted of in vitro fertilization (with or without ICSI), assisted hatching, frozen 
embryo transfer, zygote intrafallopian transfer, gamete intrafallopian transfer, and/or donor 
eggs or embryos and (2) OI via oral or injectable medications with or without IUI.21 
Maternal report was linked with the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology–Clinical 
Outcome Reporting System (SART-CORS), a database of ART outcomes reported from 
member US clinics to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sensitivity and 
specificity of maternal report compared with SART-CORS were high (93% and 99%, 
respectively).22 Given the absence of a registry for verifying OI/IUI and geographic

 limitation of the SART linkage, we used maternal report for all infertility treatment 
information and relied on birth certificate data only when missing (n = 147; 3%).
Developmental Assessment
The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) is a validated developmental screening 
instrument recommended for early identification of developmental delays.23–25 The ASQ 
encourages parents to perform activities with their children to accurately respond to 
questions capturing 5 developmental domains (ie, fine motor, gross motor, communication, 
personal-social functioning, and problem-solving ability). Parents completed the ASQ at 4, 
6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age, corrected for gestational age.26,27 We 
implemented the ASQ–second edition27 for screening at ages 4 to 12 months and the third 
edition26 from ages 18 months onwards as ASQ-3 became available in 2009.
Each item was scored as recommended26,27 (“yes” = 10 points, “sometimes” = 5 points, and 
“not yet” = 0 points) and summed for each domain (0–60 points). Domain-specific fails 
were defined as scores 2 SDs below the mean for normative data.26,27 Study personnel 
followed up with parents when the child failed any of the 5 domains or parental concern was 
noted. Trained specialists implemented an age-appropriate follow-up ASQ for the domain(s) 
that failed or discussed concerns. We defined age at fail as the time of the initial fail. When 
follow-up was incomplete after an initial fail, the child remained as failing that ASQ. 
Screening instruments were considered valid only if completed in the specified age 
windows.26,27 For children who failed any ASQ domain, a referral was made to the New 
York State Early Intervention Program (EIP), which provides free developmental services as 
needed after clinical evaluation.28
Additional Developmental Data
We linked EIP data to assess whether the proportions of children referred for developmental 
evaluation differed by infertility treatment exposure. Records were matched on identifiers 
(ie, birth dates and names). The Early Intervention Program provided aggregate tables for 
proportions of Upstate KIDS children referred for evaluation stratified by plurality and 
infertility treatment status. Individual-level data from EIP required parental consent, which 
was solicited from those whose child failed a previous ASQ and were received for 478 
children.
Questionnaires accompanying the ASQ at 30 and 36 months also asked mothers to report 
whether their children received any developmental services. The positive and negative 
predictive values of reported use of developmental services compared against EIP linkage 
were high for the 478 infants (86.2% and 95.0%, respectively).
Last, a subgroup of 314 singletons (8%) and 132 twin pairs (12%) underwent clinical 
diagnostic examinations at 3 to 4 years of age. For this assessment, children who failed the 
ASQ screening (at 30 or 36 months) and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers29 (at 
18 months) were invited along with a random sample of children with no history of fails. 
Based on this evaluation, clinicians provided diagnostic codes for each child. Developmental 
disability was defined as having 1 or more of these diagnoses: autism spectrum disorder

 (ASD); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; language, learning, and speech disorders; 
cognitive deficits; cerebral palsy; and/or sensory impairments.
Covariates
Covariate information came from vital records (ie, maternal and paternal ages, insurance 
status, plurality, previous live birth, prepregnancy body mass index [BMI, calculated as 
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], birth weight; and gestational age) 
or by baseline maternal report (ie, paternal BMI, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, 
and smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy).
Statistical Methods
Sociodemographic characteristics relative to infertility treatment were compared using χ2 
and t tests. Infant characteristics are shown for all singletons and a randomly selected twin of 
each sibling pair. Triplets and quadruplets from 45 families were excluded owing to small 
numbers (n = 134 children).
We first evaluated the prospective associations between infertility treatment exposure 
(yes/no) and failing any ASQ domain and then by each of the 5 domains. Treatment type 
was further assessed separating ART and OI/IUI. Children conceived without infertility 
treatment were the reference group in all analyses. We used generalized linear mixed-effects 
models with a logit link to estimate the associations between infant treatment and failing the 
ASQ. These models provided adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs. All models included 
maternal-level random intercepts and nested infant-level random intercepts to account for 
the correlation owing to repeated measures and clustering of infants within mothers.30 In 
models based only on singletons or primary cohort where only 1 infant was included from 
each mother, an infant-level random intercept was included to account for repeated measures 
of infants. Sampling weights were applied to account for the study’s design of oversampling 
infants conceived with infertility treatment and twins.21 Weights were derived using New 
York state birth certificate data on infertility treatment, plurality, and region of birth for all 
infants born during the period of recruitment. Time was modeled assuming a nonlinear 
trajectory of the odds of failing. The estimation was based on weighted likelihood function, 
which was computed using an adaptive quadrature and the standard errors were calculated 
based on sandwich-type variance estimation. Our longitudinal methods accounted for 
children’s varying developmental stages and varying failures over the course of follow-up, 
allowing flexibility of children to fail at any point in time but not necessarily subsequent 
follow-up screenings.
A priori factors known to be associated with development (such as socioeconomic status or 
smoking)31,32 and associated with infertility treatment were adjusted for including maternal 
age, race/ethnicity, education, insurance, married/living as married, previous live birth, and 
smoking during pregnancy. Birth weight was included in a separate model to avoid potential 
overadjustment bias.33 Missing data on marital status (n = 206 infants) and prior live birth (n 
= 43) were completed using multiple imputations after creating 10 data sets based on a 
Bernoulli distribution, with probabilities dependent on their observed distributions by

 infertility treatment type. For variables where few (n <10) were missing (such as smoking or 
insurance), the missing were imputed using the most frequent response.
Because the ASQ is a screening rather than diagnostic tool, we also evaluated cross-
sectional associations between infertility treatment and maternal reported use of 
developmental services reported at 30 and/or 36 months of age, using logistic regression and 
adjusting for similar covariates and weighted for the sampling framework. Analyses 
accounted for missing questionnaire data by inverse probability weighting.34 To construct 
the weights for missing data, a regression model was run to determine the probability of 
missing data at 30 and 36 months (yes/no) by infertility treatment exposure and plurality. 
Sampling weights were multiplied to missing weights to further take into account missing 
data. Total weights were trimmed at the 95th percentile. For twins, generalized estimating 
equations were used to account for the correlation between twin pairs. Last, for the children 
with diagnostic information at 3 to 4 years, χ2 tests of the frequencies were made with 
respect to developmental diagnoses among singletons (n = 314) and 1 twin of each pair (n = 
132). All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
In total, 3402 mothers (of 4011 children) unexposed and 1422 mothers (of 1830 children) 
exposed to infertility treatment were included in our analysis. Six to 10 percent of children 
failed at least 1 of the ASQ developmental domains at each screen (eTable in the 
Supplement). Domain-specific fails were fewer, ranging from 2% to 5% per screen. 
Longitudinal follow-up decreased overtime in the families. However, almost all children had 
at least 1 valid ASQ screen between 4 and 36 months. Mothers (n = 4824; 97% of 4989) 
who returned the ASQ were more frequently white (81% vs 65%) compared with mothers 
who never returned one (n = 165; 3%) but did not otherwise differ.
Table 1 shows the differences in characteristics by use of any infertility treatment. 
Differences between the specific treatment types were also observed, with older parental 
ages; more twin births; higher education and paternal BMI; and lower maternal 
prepregnancy BMI, birth weight, and gestational age in the ART group compared with the 
OI/IUI group.
The unadjusted longitudinal trajectories of the ASQ failures were similar, irrespective of 
infertility treatment among all children and after stratifying by plurality (Figure). 
Adjustment for covariates strengthened associations but they did not reach statistical 
significance (aOR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.94–1.89; Table 2). Assisted reproductive technology was 
associated with an increased risk for failing any developmental domain (aOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 
1.21–2.72) and, specifically, the personal-social (aOR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.15–3.59) and 
problem-solving (aOR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.15–4.74) domains. However, given the higher 
probability of failing the ASQ among twins and the higher proportion of twins in the ART 
group (34% vs 19%) than the unexposed group, results were further stratified by plurality. 
No statistically significant differences were observed for any of the 5 domains and even 
when further adjusting for birth weight among singletons or twins.

 When we linked our cohort with the state’s EIP data, we observed no significant differences 
in the percentages of children referred for evaluation by infertility treatment status. That is, 
among 3904 singletons, 21.2% of children conceived with treatment and 20.7% of children 
not conceived with treatment were referred. Among 1084 nonrelated twins, 40.8% of 
children conceived with treatment and 38.6% of children not conceived with treatment were 
referred. In addition, no differences were found in maternal report of children’s use of 
developmental services (eg, aOR, 1.26; 95% CI,0.69–2.30 for any treatment) (Table 3).
Among children who completed diagnostic evaluations at 3 to 4 years, 73 (16%) had a 
developmental disability that included 1 or multiple of the following: language-, learning-, 
or speech-related disorders (n = 49), ASD (n = 17), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
and its subtypes (n = 16), cognitive deficits (n = 6), cerebral palsy (n = 2), and sensory 
impairments (n = 2). Frequency of any disability did not differ by infertility treatment 
exposure; 18% of children without treatment (n = 266) and 13% of children conceived by 
infertility treatment (n = 180) had a diagnosis (P = .15). Similarly, further stratifying by type 
of treatment showed no differences: 16% among children conceived with OI/IUI (n = 89) 
having a diagnosis and 11% of children conceived with ART (n = 91) (P = .25).
Discussion
In the first US birth cohort designed specifically to assess infertility treatment and children’s 
development through 3 years of age, we observed that ART was associated with increased 
risk for developmental delays but associations were primarily owing to the higher twinning 
rate associated with ART and were not statistically significant after stratifying by plurality. 
We also observed no difference in parental reports of children using developmental services 
or referral for EIP evaluation relative to infertility treatment. Moreover, the prevalence of 
clinically diagnosed developmental disabilities at 3 to 4 years of age was not associated with 
infertility treatment in a subsample of children undergoing clinical evaluations. These 
findings suggest that infertility treatment is not associated with developmental delays 
through 3 years of age, irrespective of treatment type, after accounting for plurality.
Studies on children conceived by infertility treatment in the United States remain scarce and 
have predominantly focused on the risk for ASD, mostly finding no association.12,15,18,35 In 
particular, several analyses based on linkages between the National ART Surveillance 
System and developmental services among Californian children (born 1997–2006) have 
been conducted to evaluate autism risk in relation to ART.14,15,20 Although a higher risk was 
found in association with ART,14 socioeconomic factors related to surveillance may largely 
explain this finding.15 However, further analyses by the same authors found that ICSI was 
associated with an increased risk for autism in the first 5 years of life (adjusted hazard ratio, 
approximately 1.65 among singletons and multiples) compared with in vitro fertilization.20 
According to our SART-CORS linkage, more than 70% of ART children were conceived 
with ICSI and fewer with in vitro fertilization, prohibiting further comparisons of the 
techniques. Our cohort was systematically followed up through age 3 years and will 
continue through age 8 years, allowing for a more complete assessment of development 
including disabilities that may not manifest until later ages.

 Our findings of the OI/IUI group suggest that these non-ART treatments are also not likely 
to lead to large short-term differences in a child’s development (ie, up to 3 years of age). 
Other studies have also found no statistically significant differences in developmental 
disorders,17 cognitive development,19 or autism.12,18 A registry study from Denmark 
suggested a small increased risk for mental disorders associated with OI/IUI.13 Specifically, 
risks were observed for ASD (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05–1.37) but not intellectual 
disabilities (1.02; 95% CI, 0.81–1.28).13 Although our study could not evaluate autism given 
the follow-up through 3 years, the ASQ was designed to screen for developmental delays 
associated with intellectual disabilities or ASD.36 However, given our relatively smaller 
sample size in comparison with the study from Denmark (approximately 33 000 exposed), 
we were unable to rule out weak associations with certainty, although some of the ASQ 
domains were found to have associations in the 1.20 range for OI/IUI.
Of note, the ASQ was designed as a screening not diagnostic instrument, and its concurrent 
validity in comparison with other clinically administered developmental assessment tools 
varies.23,26,27,37,38 For the Upstate KIDS Study, cutoffs at 2 SDs below the average were 
used to maximize specificity and minimize overreferral that might result in undue parental 
distress. A small Iranian study using the ASQ at 60 months similarly reported no differences 
in the failure of domains among 61 singlet on term infants conceived by ART compared with 
61 infants spontaneously conceived after adjusting for education and birth weight.39
Our findings are strengthened by the multiple methods used to evaluate childhood 
development (which is important given that children can develop in an uneven manner), the 
demonstrated validity of maternal-reported ART treatment data compared with clinical data 
from SART-CORS,22 and our ability to link children with the state’s EIP. Still, our study had 
limitations including attrition over time, particularly for the unexposed cohort and twins, and 
missing data stemming from ASQs being completed by parents outside of established age 
ranges as observed in a previous study.28 However, we accounted for missing data via 
generalized linear mixed-effects modeling40 and by inverse probability weighting for 
missing responses.34 The sample sizes of the 2 specific treatment groups, particularly among 
twins, were under powered to detect small associations that could not be ruled out by our 
analysis. The low initial enrollment rate and its difference by exposure status (32% among 
exposed vs 26% among nonexposed) may limit generalizability.
Conclusions
We found no evidence suggesting that children’s development through age 3 years—using a 
standardized parental rating instrument and augmented by registry linkage for 
developmental services—is associated with any type of infertility treatment in comparison 
with children conceived without such treatments after accounting for plurality. The elevated 
probability of delay associated with multiple births remains a risk to be weighed given the 
higher twinning rate after use of ART. Continued follow-up of children conceived by 
infertility treatment is needed to ensure the absence of later-onset conditions.

 At a Glance
•
The Upstate KIDS Study, which recruited mothers and their children 
from New York state (excluding New York City) between 2008 and 
2010, was designed to assess the association between the mode of 
conception and children’s development through age 3 years.
•
Use of any infertility treatment was not associated with risk for failing 
any developmental domain as assessed by the Ages and Stages 
Questionnaire.
•
Specific treatment using ovulation induction with or without 
intrauterine insemination was not associated with failing any 
developmental domain.
•
Conception by assisted reproductive technology was associated with 
failing any domain, but not significantly, after accounting for plurality.
•
No difference in parental reports of children using developmental 
services or referral for Early Intervention Program evaluation was 
found relative to infertility treatment or the specific types.

 Figure. Probabilities of Failing the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) From 4 to 36 Months 
by Infertility Treatment Status and Plurality
The probabilities of failing any ASQ domain and of the specific domains are shown. The 
longitudinal crude probabilities of failure by infertility treatment status for all children and 
stratified by plurality were estimated by generalized linear mixed-effects models using ASQ 
data from 4 to 36 months in the Upstate KIDS Study.
