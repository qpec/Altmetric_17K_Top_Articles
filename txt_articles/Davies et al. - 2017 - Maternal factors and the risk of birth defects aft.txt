Objective To assess the contribution of maternal factors to major
birth defects after in vitro fertilisation (IVF), intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI), and natural conception.
Design Retrospective cohort study in South Australia for the
period January 1986 to December 2002.
Setting A whole of population study.
Population A census of all IVF and ICSI linked to registries for
births, pregnancy terminations, and birth defects (diagnosed
before a child’s fifth birthday).
Methods Odds ratios (ORs) for birth defects were calculated
among IVF, ICSI, and natural conceptions for maternal age,
parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking, pre-existing diseases, and
conditions in pregnancy, with adjustment for confounding factors.
Main outcome measures Birth defects classified by International
Classification of Diseases (ninth revision) and British Paediatric
Association (ICD9-BPA) codes.
Results There were 2211 IVF, 1399 ICSI, and 301 060 naturally
conceived births. The unadjusted prevalence of any birth defect
was 7.1, 9.9, and 5.7% in the IVF, ICSI, and natural conception
groups, respectively. As expected, the risk of birth defects increased
with maternal age among the natural conceptions. In contrast, for
IVF and ICSI combined, relative to natural conceptions, births to
women aged ≤29 years had a higher risk (adjusted odds ratio,
aOR 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 1.04–1.94), births to
women aged 35–39 years had no difference in risk (aOR 1.01;
95% CI 0.74–1.37), and births to women aged ≥40 years had a
lower risk of defects (aOR 0.45; 95% CI 0.22–0.92). Defects were
also elevated for nulliparity, anaemia, and urinary tract infection
in births after ICSI, but not after IVF.
Conclusions The usual age–birth defect relationship is reversed in
births after IVF and ICSI, and the associations for other maternal
factors and defects vary between IVF and ICSI.
Keywords Birth defects, ICSI, Infertility, IVF, maternal factors.
Tweetable abstract Risk of birth defects in women over 40 years
is lower after infertility treatment than for natural conceptions.

Introduction
Treatment
by
assisted reproductive
technology
(ART),
including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI), is an increasingly common strategy
used to overcome infertility internationally.1,2 It has become
apparent that ART use is associated with an increased risk of
birth defects, which varies by treatment modality.3,4 The
causal pathways that underlie these associations are not
definitively understood in humans, although specific labora-
tory factors may contribute, including the embryo culture
media, ICSI gamete manipulation, and returning embryos to
the uterus soon after ovarian stimulation.4,5
In addition to potential treatment-related factors, paren-
tal health and lifestyle characteristics may also contribute
to the excess risk of birth defects in couples using ART.

Fertility and assisted reproduction
 For example, compared with the fertile population, female
recipients of ART are more likely to be older, obese, and
have metabolic disease and chronic health conditions,
including pre-existing diabetes and hypertension,6 each of
which is an independent risk factor for birth defects.7–9 As
a result of the contribution of these factors to infertility,
studies have been largely unable to differentiate between
the influence of ART treatment and parental characteristics
on birth defects when comparing outcomes with a fertile
population.4,10 In addition, to our knowledge, no studies
within the ART population have examined whether the
established risk profiles for birth defects observed in the
general population are similar among couples receiving
ART, and whether they apply to both IVF and ICSI. As a
result of the increasing use of ICSI for reasons other than
severe semen defects,11,12 it is important to consider the
potential role of specific treatments independent of infertil-
ity aetiology. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to
examine the degree to which maternal health and lifestyle
factors are associated with the risk of birth defects after
IVF and ICSI, adjusting for infertility aetiology and other
potential confounding factors.
Methods
Study population
As detailed previously,3 we linked data regarding all ART
treatment cycles in South Australia for the period Jan-
uary 1986–December 2002 with the contemporary statewide
perinatal outcomes data collection, and with the South Aus-
tralian Birth Defects Register (SABDR). South Australia
mandates the notification of all live births, terminations, and
stillbirths of at least 20 weeks of gestation or 400 g birth-
weight using the Supplementary Birth Record. Terminations
of pregnancy for congenital abnormalities before 20 weeks
of gestation are also reported by law to the SABDR.
Maternal medical conditions (pre-existing and gesta-
tional) and reproductive history are recorded from antena-
tal records. We have restricted the present study to
maternal factors alone, as paternal data are relatively sparse.
Information on birth defects is collected up to the child’s
fifth birthday, beginning with reports at the time of birth
or within 28 days of birth. For the present study, birth
defects were classified according to the International Classi-
fication of Diseases (9th edition) and British Paediatric
Association (ICD9-BPA) codes,3 and only major abnormal-
ities were included. Congenital cerebral palsy (CP), as
defined by ICD9-BPA, was also routinely reported and was
therefore included in the present study. As previously
reported, CP contributes 0.4% of cases.3 Please refer to our
previous publication for the full definitions of defects, and
inclusion and exclusion criteria.3
Statistical analyses
The unit of analysis used here is the birth of an individual
(terminations of pregnancy for defects are included in this
category). The current analysis was restricted to births con-
ceived with IVF or ICSI conducted with fresh or frozen
gametes or embryos, which were compared with each
other, and with births conceived naturally (e.g. among the
fertile population). The following maternal lifestyle factors
were considered: maternal age at delivery, parity, body
mass index (BMI) at first ART clinic visit (BMI is available
only for women accessing ART), and smoking in early
pregnancy. We also assessed maternal pre-existing condi-
tions (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and epilepsy) and
gestational
conditions
[pregnancy-induced
hypertension,
including pre-eclampsia, impaired glucose tolerance (GT),
gestational diabetes (GDM), anaemia, and urinary tract
infection (UTI)]. For completeness, we also report out-
comes for the small numbers of women with pre-existing
diabetes and epilepsy, as although the risk estimates are
unstable, these conditions were significantly associated with
birth defects in the entire population of all births from
which this cohort was drawn.3
Five variables used in this analysis had missing data, and
there was evidence that it was not missing completely at
random (MCAR).13 The absence of data for two of the
variables [parity and the Socio-Economic Indicators for
Areas (SEIFA), a measure of economic disadvantage] could
be ignored for this analysis, because the volume of missing
data was small. Missing data for smoking, BMI, and to a
lesser extent infertility diagnosis could not be ignored,
however. Missing values for all five variables were imputed
several times using regression models (linear or logistic as
appropriate), with 100 imputations.13,14 Sensitivity analyses
were performed by varying the random number seeds and
increasing the number of imputations in the multiply-
imputed models. The results from the sensitivity analyses
were similar to those presented in this paper. Associations
between the presence of major birth defects and maternal
health and lifestyle factors were expressed as adjusted odds
ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We
analysed the data using Bayesian logistic generalised esti-
mating equations (GEEs), implemented via data augmenta-
tion, as we have a binary outcome with some sparse
data.15,16 We used weakly informative smoothing priors to
stabilise the estimates. GEE modelling accounted for the
clustering of births within women.
The role of maternal factors on the risk of birth defects
was first considered separately for IVF, ICSI, and natural
conceptions using three models. Model 1 was unadjusted.
Model 2 included the year of treatment and the SEIFA
small-area-aggregated
index
of
relative
disadvantage.17
Model 3, the fully adjusted model, included the above, and

 all other predictors, including maternal conditions. The
models were then repeated among a pooled group of IVF
and ICSI births, and then repeated to include comparison
with the natural conception group across each risk factor
stratum.
In a subsequent analysis we compared IVF with ICSI
using three models. Model 1 included each maternal factor
and the ART treatment details, including year of treatment,
number of embryos transferred, and fresh- versus frozen-
embryo transfer. Model 2 further adjusted model 1 for
infertility aetiology. For the IVF group, the aetiology cate-
gories were: combined male and female infertility, male
infertility only, endometriosis only, ovulatory infertility
only, tubal infertility only, other and mixed aetiology
female infertility, and idiopathic and unknown infertility
aetiology. For the ICSI group, the aetiology categories were:
male infertility only, female infertility only, and all other
aetiologies. Model 3 included all of the maternal health
and lifestyle variables in the same model, adjusted for all of
the potential confounding factors (ART treatment details,
SEIFA, and infertility aetiology).
We did not adjust for gestational age as this is likely to
be in the causal pathway, either as a consequence of a birth
defect or potentially as a mediator for certain specific
defects; however, we did undertake models with and with-
out adjustment for multiplicity. For this purpose, higher-
order multiple pregnancies were combined with twins as
they constituted a very small proportion of multiple preg-
nancies.3 We did not adjust for multiple comparisons. In
the tables we present data on the fully adjusted model only
(e.g. model 3).
Results
Pregnancy outcomes
Demographic and pregnancy characteristics for the study
groups are presented in Table 1. There were 2211 IVF,
1399 ICSI, and 301 060 naturally conceived births. The
percentage of women aged 35–39 and ≥40 years in the IVF
and ICSI groups was more than double that of the fertile
population. Nulliparity varied from 37.6% in the fertile
group to 70.1% in the ICSI group. The rate of multiple
pregnancy varied from 2.4% in the fertile group to 33.4%
for ICSI and 36.4% for IVF, as the study included an early
period when multiple-embryo transfer was common. The
most common pre-existing health condition was asthma
(3.3, 4.5, and, 4.2%, in IVF, ICSI, and natural conceptions,
respectively), and the most common condition arising in
pregnancy was anaemia (14.3, 15.7, and 6.0%, in IVF, ICSI,
and natural conceptions, respectively). Most infants (over
96% in each group) were liveborn and survived the neona-
tal period.
Treatment-related factors for IVF and ICSI are presented
in Table 2. Fresh-embryo transfer cycles were predominant
for both IVF and ICSI groups.
Maternal demographic and lifestyle factors and
birth defects
The unadjusted prevalence of any birth defect was 7.1%
(n = 157) in the IVF group, 9.9% (n = 138) in the ICSI
group, and 5.8% in the fertile population (n = 17 408).
Multiple defects occurred in 2.3% of IVF births and 3.0%
of ICSI births.
Relationships between maternal factors and risk of birth
defects are presented in Table 3. In the left column are the
maternal factors, followed by the count of subjects in each
stratum, followed by the count and the percentage of
defects in each stratum. These are followed by the fully
adjusted models assessing the risk of birth defects. This is
repeated for natural conceptions, IVF, and ICSI.

Risk of birth defects after IVF and ICSI
 For natural conceptions there was a monotonic increase
in the prevalence of birth defects across categories of
increasing age, from 5.6% for women aged ≤29 years to
8.2% for women aged ≥40 years. Relative to the reference
group of women aged 30–34 years, women aged ≤29 years
had a lower risk of defects (aOR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88–0.95),
whereas
women
aged
≥40 years
had
a
higher
risk
(aOR 1.49; 95% CI 1.33–1.66).
In contrast, the prevalence of birth defects after IVF was
9.4% for women aged ≤29 years, which declined to 3.6% for
women aged ≥40 years. Within the IVF group, births to
women aged ≤29 years had a significantly higher risk of birth
defects compared with the reference group aged 30–34 years,
which was robust to adjustment (aOR 1.55; 95% CI 1.01–
2.38). A similar, but not statistically significant pattern was
observed for ICSI, where the prevalence of birth defects was
11.3% for births to women aged ≤29 years, and 6.3% for
births to women aged ≥40 years. Pooling the IVF and ICSI
data indicated that relative to the reference group aged 30–
34 years births to women aged ≤29 years had a higher risk of
defects (aOR 1.42; 95% CI 1.04–1.94), there was no differ-
ence for women aged 35–39 years (aOR 1.01; 95% CI 0.74–
1.37), and births to women aged ≥40 years had a lower risk
of defects (aOR 0.45; 95% CI 0.22–0.92).
For natural conceptions, in the fully adjusted models
nulliparity and smoking increased the risk of birth defects
(aOR 1.19 and 1.04, respectively; 95% CI 1.15–1.23 and
1.01–1.08,
respectively),

did
pre-existing
diabetes
(aOR 2.17; 95% CI 1.76–2.67), asthma (aOR 1.14; 95% CI

anaemia (aOR 1.15; 95% CI 1.08–1.23; Table 4). Although

 models 1 and 2, this association was attenuated in the fully
adjusted
model
(aOR 1.06;
95% CI
0.99–1.14).
Pre-
existing hypertension (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00–1.31) was
significantly associated with risk only in the unadjusted
model and was not significant after adjustment. Gestational
diabetes,
impaired
glucose
tolerance,
and
pregnancy-
induced hypertension were not significant risk factors in
any model and are not presented.
For
the
IVF
group,
in
addition
to
maternal
age
≤29 years, significant risk factors for birth defects in the
fully adjusted model (model 3) were being overweight
(aOR 1.64; 95% CI 1.10–2.44) or being obese (aOR 2.09;
95% CI 1.31–3.34). Pre-existing conditions and obstetric
conditions were not significant risk factors in any IVF
model (Table 4).
For the ICSI group, in the fully adjusted models, signifi-
cant risk factors for birth defects included nulliparity
(aOR 2.08;
95% CI
1.25–3.44),
anaemia
(aOR 1.64;
95% CI 1.03–2.61), and urinary tract infection (aOR 2.31;
95% CI 1.27–4.20; Table 4).
The risk estimates did not vary appreciably across mod-
els for either ART treatment group or natural conceptions
when there was adjustment for multiplicity.
IVF versus ICSI
The relationships between maternal factors and the risk of
birth defects were not identical between IVF and ICSI
births. With regards to nulliparity, the risk of birth defects
for the IVF group was significantly lower than that for the
ICSI group in all models (aOR 0.45; 95% CI 0.24–0.85;
data not shown). In contrast, among smokers, the risk of
birth defects was significantly higher in the IVF groups
compared with the ICSI group (aOR 2.12; 95% CI 1.06–
4.24; data not shown).

Risk of birth defects after IVF and ICSI
 Discussion
Main findings
We believe that this is the first study to examine the inde-
pendent effects of maternal demographic, lifestyle, and
medical factors in an ART population by treatment modal-
ity. The present study shows that established maternal risk
factors for defects in the fertile population do not necessar-
ily follow the same pattern in births following ART treat-
ment, and that the profile of risk factors varies by ART
treatment type. In contrast to the fertile population, in
which children of older mothers had a higher risk of birth
defects, in infertile women treated with IVF, the greatest
risk was among the youngest women (≤29 years), who had
over double the rate of birth defects compared with their
oldest counterparts, and a significantly higher rate than
age-matched peers in the fertile population. Adjustment for
infertility aetiology and other maternal factors did not
change this association. A similar pattern was seen when
IVF and ICSI were combined, with the highest risk
observed in young women, grading down to an odds ratio
of 0.45 in aged women 40 years and older. This finding
directly contradicts the untested assertion that the older
age of women undergoing ART treatment is the primary
cause of any observed increase in birth defects.18
Strengths and limitations
The main strength of this study is that we have nearly a
complete ascertainment of mode of conception for an
entire state population, with birth defects ascertained to
5 years of age. We also adjusted for treatment-related fac-
tors, multiplicity, and infertility aetiology; however, we can-
not be certain whether conditions arising in pregnancy
(UTI and anaemia) are the cause or consequence of the
adverse outcomes associated with ART. Furthermore, as
this study required multiple comparisons within the same
population, we cannot preclude that some statistically sig-
nificant findings occurred by chance, which reinforces the
value of replicating these observations in another popula-
tion. Another limitation is the absence of information on
paternal characteristics, as these data are not routinely
recorded in maternity records. The most recent data are
from 2002. Nevertheless, the clinical factors studied remain
in use internationally and clinical outcomes have not varied
greatly in the intervening years.
Interpretation
As we adjusted for infertility aetiology, our findings sup-
port the possibility of an unknown factor(s) contributing
to defect risk. Although there may be a contribution from
some unmeasured patient-related factors to the elevated
risk in young women, we know of no potential confound-
ing factor that could reduce the risk by more than half in
older women treated with ART compared with either
younger women with infertility or age-matched peers in
the fertile population. This implies that a previously unde-
scribed protective mechanism is in action, the details of
which we can only speculate. As all women in the ART
groups received ovulation induction drugs and invasive
treatment involving gamete manipulation, one possibility is
that IVF and ICSI may generate embryos with an increased
risk of birth defects, and such embryos may be more likely
to survive in the uterine environment of a younger rather
than an older mother; however, this cannot explain the
very low prevalence of birth defects observed in IVF births
to women aged 40+ years (3.6%), compared with their fer-
tile
age-matched
peers
(8.2%).
Although
aneuploidy
increases with age for reasons that are incompletely under-
stood, and which are presently uncontrollable, the resump-
tion of meiosis in the ovary occurs under the influence of
gonadotropins,19 which raises the prospect that through an
unknown process the administration of gonadotropins in
older women might provide a protective effect on the
oocyte
during
meiosis.
Alternatively,
some
presently
unknown but common factor related to diminished fertility
in older women may be strongly protective against birth
defects should fertilisation occur.
Further research will be needed studying pregnancies with
donor embryos, and using markers of embryo quality by
age, to resolve the apparent age paradox. Nevertheless, it
should be of interest to older women seeking ART to note
that they may be at less risk of major birth defects than their
fertile age-matched peers. Unfortunately, young women may
have a higher risk of birth defects relative to older infertility
patients or fertile age-matched peers; thus, we urgently need
to identify modifiable risk factors for this group.
Among pregnancies conceived with IVF, smoking in
pregnancy and being overweight or obese elevated the risk
of defects, whereas pre-existing and gestational health con-
ditions did not. These associations are consistent with risks
reported in the general fertile population.7,20 BMI was not
available for the fertile population for this study, however,
and represents a knowledge gap for subsequent study.
In contrast, in ICSI pregnancies, nulliparity, anaemia,
and urinary tract infection were associated with birth
defects, and maternal BMI was not. With the exception of
anaemia, these associations have been reported in the gen-
eral population.8,9,21–23 The pattern of associations between
maternal factors and birth defects diverged for IVF and
ICSI, with a significantly elevated risk associated with nulli-
parity in ICSI compared with IVF. Although smoking was
a risk factor for birth defects in the IVF group, it appeared
to be protective in the ICSI group.
We hypothesise that the restriction of risk associated with
nulliparity and infection to the ICSI group may reflect an
ICSI-specific effect on the maternal immune system. In
1542

 rodent models, ICSI can result in a pro-inflammatory state
with increased placental concentrations of reactive oxygen
species and inflammatory cytokines.24 During a first preg-
nancy, the maternal immune system adapts to accommodate
the fetus by learning to recognise fetal antigens. In subse-
quent pregnancies, maternal tolerance of the fetus is
reflected in altered maternal cytokine profiles, decreased risk
of inflammatory diseases such as pre-eclampsia, chronic
hypertension, and anaemia,25–27 and increased risk of infec-
tion.28 Thus, the cluster of associations observed here for
ICSI may reflect a state of maternal immune maladaptation
to early pregnancy. This warrants further directed research.
The increased birth defect risk associated with smoking
after IVF compared with ICSI may also be informative with
regards to the maternal response to an ICSI conceptus, as
the risk of certain inflammatory conditions of first preg-
nancy, such as pre-eclampsia, is reduced by smoking.29,30
Conclusion
Congenital anomalies are a major cause of stillbirth and
neonatal deaths, and have enduring consequences for the
health of surviving infants. This study demonstrates that
the contribution of maternal demographic, health, and life-
style characteristics to the risk of major birth defects varies
by mode of conception. The inverse association of birth
defects with maternal age after assisted conception, particu-
larly among IVF pregnancies, contradicts the assumption
that older maternal age is the cause of an observed excess
of birth defects in pregnancies resulting from IVF and ICSI.
It also raises important questions for further research on
whether the established age–birth defect relationship can be
modified. We also observed that the association between
maternal risk factors and birth defects varied between IVF
and ICSI for parity and smoking, which may indicate dif-
ferences in the maternal response to the conceptus. Some
treatment subgroups within the ART population may
require closer monitoring or targeted medical management:
the doubled birth defect risk in nulliparous women after
ICSI but not after IVF is important, as ICSI is now the pre-
ferred method of fertilisation across all regions of the
world,12 even in the absence of male-factor infertility.11
Research should be directed to determining how IVF and
ICSI procedures contribute to, and interact with, maternal
health status in the aetiology of birth defects.
