Acute exposure to fine particle (PM2.5) induces DNA methylation
changes implicated in inflammation and oxidative stress. We con-
ducted a crossover trial to determine whether B-vitamin supple-
mentation
averts
such
changes.
Ten
healthy
adults
blindly
received a 2-h, controlled-exposure experiment to sham under
placebo, PM2.5 (250 μg/m3) under placebo, and PM2.5 (250 μg/m3)
under B-vitamin supplementation (2.5 mg/d folic acid, 50 mg/d vitamin
B6, and 1 mg/d vitamin B12), respectively. We profiled epigenome-wide
methylation before and after each experiment using the Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in peripheral CD4+ T-helper cells.
PM2.5 induced methylation changes in genes involved in mitochondrial
oxidative energy metabolism. B-vitamin supplementation prevented
these changes. Likewise, PM2.5 depleted 11.1% [95% confidence in-
terval (CI), 0.4%, 21.7%; P = 0.04] of mitochondrial DNA content
compared with sham, and B-vitamin supplementation attenuated
the PM2.5 effect by 102% (Pinteraction = 0.01). Our study indicates that
individual-level prevention may be used to complement regulations
and control potential mechanistic pathways underlying the adverse
PM2.5 effects, with possible significant public health benefit in areas
with frequent PM2.5 peaks.
air pollution | B vitamins | DNA methylation | mitochondria
H
istorical episodes of air pollution peaks were shown to be
associated with up to >10 times increased death rates (1).
According to the WHO, 92% of the world’s population currently
lives in places where air quality levels exceed the WHO limits (2).
Ambient PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 μm)
pollution is one of the most prominent air pollutants (3), because
they deposit in the respiratory bronchioles and the alveoli and
stimulate local and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (4).
Over the past few decades, substantial lowering of ambient PM2.5
levels has been achieved through large-scale emissions control poli-
cies (5). However, exposure peaks with adverse health consequences
are still frequently recorded (6, 7), even in areas typically exhibiting
low levels (5). The molecular mechanisms underlying PM2.5’s health
effects are not fully understood, and the lack of preventative options
at the individual level adds complexity to tackling this major public
health challenge.
Recent studies in environmental epigenetics provide opportunities
to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of exposure-related
health effects and to develop novel individual-level interventions.
DNA methylation, a potentially modifiable epigenetic mechanism,
can regulate gene expression and chromosome integrity via addition
of methyl groups to cytosine residues (8). The dynamic DNA land-
scape can be rapidly altered in peripheral leukocytes following PM2.5
exposure; indeed, such changes are postulated to underlie PM-
induced systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (9, 10). Most
evidence of this phenomenon in humans is based on a heterogeneous
mixture of leukocytes (9–12), but a loss of methylation in in-
flammatory genes and subsequent inflammatory responses, specifi-
cally in circulating Th cells, are observed in vivo after environmental
challenge (13, 14). Notably, DNA methylation is dependent on a
biochemical cycle that supplies methyl groups (CH3) while relying on
methyl nutrients (i.e., B vitamins including folic acid, vitamin B6 and
B12; and amino acids including methionine, betaine, and choline) (8,
15, 16). In animal studies, a methyl-nutrient-deficient diet leads to
aberrant DNA methylation patterns (17), and administration of
methyl nutrients enables restoration of epigenetic status (15, 18–20).
Likewise, human studies show that dietary methyl nutrient in-
tervention influences the plasticity of DNA methylation (21). The
potential for epigenetic modulation has also been demonstrated in
the presence of environmental stressors in animal models—Dolinoy
et al. successfully used methyl nutrients to avert the DNA hypo-
methylation induced by bisphenol A exposure (22). These findings
Significance
Air pollution is a major public health concern worldwide. The
molecular mechanistic underpinnings of the health effects of air
pollution are not fully understood, and the lack of individual-
level preventative options represent a critical knowledge gap.
Our study demonstrated the epigenetic effects of air pollution
and suggested that B vitamins might be used as prevention to
complement regulations to attenuate the impact of air pollution
on the epigenome. Our study inaugurated a line of research for
the development of preventive interventions to minimize the
adverse effects of air pollution on potential mechanistic markers.
Because of the central role of epigenetic modifications in medi-
ating environmental effects, our findings might be extended to
other toxicants and environmental diseases.

 opened new avenues for the application of epigenetic intervention to
reduce the health effects of air pollution. However, to date, epige-
netic intervention in humans in the context of air pollution has not
been described.
The present study is a placebo-controlled crossover pilot in-
tervention trial with controlled human exposure experiments to
concentrated ambient fine particles (PM2.5). We hypothesized
that acute PM2.5 exposure can rapidly modify the DNA meth-
ylation profile in peripheral CD4+ Th cells—the most prolific
cytokine producer mediating PM2.5-induced inflammatory re-
sponses—and that PM2.5-induced DNA methylation changes can
be reduced by B vitamins (i.e., folic acid, vitamin B6, and B12),
the primary source of methyl groups (Fig. 1).
Results
Study Population, Plasma B-Vitamin Concentrations, and Exposure
Levels. In the present crossover placebo-controlled trial, 10 volun-
teers completed 30 controlled exposure experiments following the
same order (Fig. S1): seven volunteers aged 19–29 y and three
aged 30–49 y. Four volunteers were white, three were Asian, and
three were other races. Six volunteers were female and three
volunteers had a body mass index (BMI) ≥25. All volunteers
maintained consistent dietary patterns throughout the trial.
The targeted concentration of PM2.5 exposures was 250 μg/m3.
However, the actual PM2.5 concentrations varied among controlled
exposure experiments to PM2.5 (100.6–287.5 μg/m3; median:
234.0 μg/m3). There was no significant difference (P = 0.38) in PM2.5
concentration between PM2.5 experiment under placebo [median:
219.1 μg/m3; interquartile range (IQR): 33.1 μg/m3] and PM2.5 ex-
periment under B vitamins (median: 237.2 μg/m3; IQR: 48.7 μg/m3).
To confirm that supplementation affected circulating nutrient
levels, we measured plasma B vitamins before and after placebo
and supplementation. The median plasma concentrations of folic
acid and vitamins B6 and B12 were 35 nmol/L (IQR: 14 nmol/L),
41 nmol/L (IQR: 16 nmol/L), and 292 pmol/L (IQR: 72 pmol/L)
before sham experiment, respectively. After volunteers took pla-
cebos for 4 wk, their median plasma concentrations were similar:
39 nmol/L (IQR: 24 nmol/L) for folic acid (P = 0.82), 37 nmol/L
(IQR: 18 nmol/L) for vitamin B6 (P = 0.75), and 262 pmol/L
(IQR: 214 pmol/L) for vitamin B12 (P = 0.42). B-vitamin supple-
mentation significantly increased the median plasma concentra-
tions of folic acid (56 nmol/L; IQR: 13; P = 0.02), vitamin B6
(428 nmol/L; IQR: 321; P = 0.004), and vitamin B12 (511 pmol/L;
IQR: 85; P = 0.01). The abovementioned P values were based on
Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a nonparametric paired difference test.
CD4+ Th Cell Purity. All CD4+ Th cell samples’ purity were over
80% (Table S1), with only minor contamination from CD8
T cells, B cells, granulocytes, and natural killer cells. The median
purity of samples collected at sham experiment, PM2.5 experiment
under placebo, and PM2.5 experiment under B vitamins was 96.9%
(IQR: 5.1), 94.8% (IQR: 7.1), and 96.1% (IQR: 4.7), respectively.
Effect of PM2.5 and B-Vitamin Supplementation on DNA Methylation.
Two-hour PM2.5 exposure substantially modified DNA methyl-
ation in CD4+ Th cells, and these changes were prevented by B-
vitamin supplementation (Fig. 2). Because our study is limited in
power, we present only the top 10 loci, selected following the
method proposed by Maccani et al. (23)—first based on effect
size and then P value (Table S2 and Fig. 2A). In the absence of
B-vitamin supplementation, PM2.5 exposure either increased or
decreased DNA methylation levels, compared with sham, at
these loci (Fig. 2A). Quantile-Quantile plots for expected vs.
observed distribution of P values showed minimal genomic in-
flation with a lambda of 1.03 (Fig. 2B).
Table S2 presents the genomic position, relation to CpG is-
lands, and gene symbol for the 10 loci. The top two loci that are
associated with known genes were cg06194186 and cg17157498.
Locus cg06194186 is located in the promoter region (TSS1500)
of the carboxypeptidase O (CPO) gene, and locus cg17157498 is
located in the promoter region (TSS1500) of the NADH de-
hydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 7 (NDUFS7) gene (Figs.
S2 and S3). Fig. 3 presents the shift in methylation level distri-
butions and corresponding IQRs pre and post each exposure
experiment for these two loci.
Four-week B-vitamin supplementation attenuated the PM2.5
effect by 28–76% at the top 10 loci. Supplementing B vitamins
resulted in a reduction in effect size by 57% for cg06194186,
49% for cg07689821, 73% for cg00068102, 31% for cg00647528,
45% for cg15426626, 28% for cg10719920, 76% for cg21986027,
74% for cg17157498, 63% for cg08075528, and 71% for
cg26995744, respectively (Table S3 and Fig. 2C).
Effect of PM2.5 and B-Vitamin Supplementation on Mitochondrial DNA
Content. CPO and NDUFS7 are both involved in mitochondrial
oxidative energy metabolism—a pivotal function with substantial
impact on mitochondrial biogenesis and clearance (24, 25). In the
secondary exploratory analysis, we further tested the associations of
PM2.5 with mitochondrial DNA content, as well as the potential
protective effect of B-vitamin supplementation. In the absence of
B-vitamin supplementation, compared with sham, 2-h exposure to
PM2.5 was estimated to be nonsignificantly associated with a −0.3%
change [95% confidence interval (CI): −10.1%, 9.5%; P = 0.94] in
mitochondrial DNA content. However, 24 h after exposure experi-
ments, we observed substantial reduction in mitochondrial DNA
content associated with PM2.5: 2-h exposure to PM2.5 significantly
depleted mitochondrial DNA content by 11.1% (95% CI: 0.4%,

Proposed conceptual model linking fine particulate matter (PM2.5), systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, and altered DNA methylation
landscape in Th cells. We hypothesized that PM2.5 inhalation triggers local and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which alters the DNA methylation
landscape in circulating CD4+ Th cells and further stimulates CD4+ Th cells. In return, stimulated CD4+ Th cells undergo more epigenetic remodeling—possibly
due to modulated methyl group availability—therefore creating a vicious circle which amplifies the inflammatory and oxidative effects of PM2.5.

 21.7%; P = 0.04) (Table S3). B-vitamin supplementation completely
attenuated such effect of PM2.5 by 102% (Pinteraction = 0.01). With
B-vitamin supplementation, 2-h exposure to PM2.5 was not associ-
ated with mitochondrial DNA content (0.2%; 95% CI: −8.3%,
8.8%; P = 0.96) (Table S3).
Exploratory Mediation Analysis and External Supporting Data. We
further deconstructed total PM2.5 effects on mitochondrial DNA
content into direct and indirect (i.e., mediated) effects to in-
vestigate whether DNA methylation levels at loci cg06194186 and
cg17157498 mediate PM2.5–mitochondrial DNA content re-
lationship. Our result indicated that 16.0% (95% CI: 4.1%,
27.9%) and 18.4% (95% CI: 9.9%, 26.9%) of the PM effect on
mitochondrial DNA content was mediated by cg06194186 and
cg17157498 methylation, respectively. Consistent with our hy-
pothesis, we observed correlation between mitochondrial DNA
content and the methylation levels of cg06194186 (r = −0.45; P =
0.06) and cg17157498 (r = 0.63; P = 0.01) in CD4+ Th cells, in an
independent external dataset.
Sensitivity Analysis. B vitamins have a long biological half-life (26),
therefore requires a washout period longer than four months. We
designed the trial without randomizing the treatment order (placebo
vs. B vitamins) to avoid long washout periods, which would have
made exposure experiments on the same volunteer less comparable.
Lifestyle factors may vary over several months, particularly in re-
lation to seasonality, which also may directly affect DNA methyl-
ation (8, 10). To rule out the potential impact of temporal trend on
our results, we adjusted for date-since-entry, and this adjustment did
not affect our conclusion. Furthermore, we conducted permutation
test on the two top loci to ensure the robustness of our analysis
(Ppermulation < 0.001). In the analysis involving the mitochondrial
DNA content, we additionally adjusted for age (continuous), BMI
(continuous), and race (categorical) to examine if our results are

Discussion
This crossover intervention trial with controlled exposure ex-
periments demonstrated that 2-h exposure to concentrated am-
bient PM2.5 (250 μg/m3) affects the dynamic epigenetic landscape
in circulating CD4+ Th cells among healthy adults. We showed
that these effects can be prevented with B-vitamin supplemen-
tation (i.e., folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12). Furthermore—as
the top loci suggested potential modulation of mitochondrial
metabolism—we followed up these findings by showing that ex-
posure to PM2.5 significantly altered mitochondrial DNA content
in circulating CD4+ Th cells, and B-vitamin supplementation
nearly completely prevented these effects.
Air pollution has been consistently associated with adverse health
outcomes in epidemiological studies (1, 3, 4, 9). Although the bi-
ological mechanism underlying the health effects of PM2.5 remains
not fully understood, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress
have been proposed as essential biological pathways (4, 27). Fur-
thermore, PM2.5 can disturb DNA methylation profiles (9, 10, 13),
which might exacerbate oxidative and inflammatory responses fol-
lowing exposure. A previous human exposure study demonstrated
that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene hypomethylation in leuko-
cytes mediates a part of PM effect on blood pressure (28). Recently,
an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) showed that low-
concentration air pollution alters DNA methylation profiles in
whole blood (9). However, the interpretation of those findings is
limited, considering potential bias due to cell-type heterogeneity
within whole blood, and by the correlational nature of obser-
vational studies (11, 12). In addition, these findings might not be
generalizable to areas with frequent air pollution peaks. The
present study—a cell type-specific EWAS using controlled ex-
posure experiments—has the unique advantage of providing
unbiased insight on the novel epigenetic underpinnings of the
proinflammatory and prooxidative effects of PM2.5 exposure peaks.
In line with our hypothesis, we demonstrated acute effects of
PM2.5 inhalation on DNA methylation in the promoter region of
genes related to mitochondrial function and oxidative metabo-
lism (24, 25): CPO, a member of the metalloenzyme family (25),
is involved in metal ion binding, metallopeptidase, and metal-
locarboxypeptidase activities—which are essential in regulation
of the steady-state concentration of O2
− in the intermembrane
space of mitochondria (29); NDUFS7 encodes one of the sub-
units of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I that
transfers electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q, and NDUFS7
mutations were of etiological significance in mitochondrial
complex I deficiency (30). Although mitochondria have their
own genetic material distinct from the nuclear DNA, the ma-
jority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear ge-
nome (31). The observation that PM2.5 exposure substantially
altered DNA methylation of nuclear genes in mitochondrial
pathways indicate that mitochondria—the specialized organelles
that regulate cellular-redox-balance and supplies energy—are a
primary target of PM-induced cellular responses (32).
Our results on mitochondrial DNA content supplemented the
findings from the epigenome-wide DNA methylation scan: ex-
posure to PM2.5 for 2 h was followed by reduced mitochondrial
DNA content 24-h postexposure. The cellular mitochondrial
genomic content is stringently regulated by biogenesis/degrada-
tion machinery (33), which is vital in the determination of cell
survival and function. Compensatory mitochondria biogenesis
can buffer an intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) chal-
lenge, as an adaptive stress response to eliminate cellular oxi-
dative damage (34). However, persistent oxidative stress may
eventually overwhelm the adaptive response system and lead to
mitochondrial DNA depletion via mitophagy (35). Our results
support this hypothesis by demonstrating that exposure to high-
concentration PM2.5 can reduce the mitochondrial DNA con-
tents in circulating CD4+ Th cells. Consistent with our results, a
recent study reported that a 10 μg/m3 increase in coarse PM
(PM10–2.5) exposure during pregnancy was associated with a
16.1% decrease in placental mitochondrial DNA content (36).
Our exploratory mediation analysis indicates that short-term
exposure to high-concentration PM2.5 depletes mitochondrial
DNA content, likely via—at least in part—modulating DNA
methylation levels of genes in mitochondrial pathways. Future
studies are warranted to investigate the potential for targeted
epigenetic interventions.
DNA methylation is a modifiable biochemical process relying
on methyl-group supplying nutrients such as B vitamins, which is
postulated to increase DNA methylation levels (8, 15, 16). This
feature renders B-vitamin supplementation an attractive phar-
maceutical intervention to counteract the PM effects, which has
been associated with loss of DNA methylation on inflammatory
genes (28). Landmark experiments on the Agouti Avy mice and
other models have shown that dietary methyl nutrients, added
during gestation (15–18) or later even in adult life (20, 21), can
be used to modulate DNA methylation status. In human studies,
intake of a folic acid-depleted diet for several weeks promotes
hypomethylation of lymphocyte genomic DNA among post-
menopausal women, and this hypomethylation is reversible with
folic acid replacement (21). Among patients with colorectal ad-
enomatous polyps, folic acid supplementation led to a 31% in-
crease in leukocyte DNA methylation and a 25% increase in
DNA from the colonic mucosa (37). Potential for human
translation is also demonstrated in animal models, as methyl
group-supplying nutrients can be used to prevent the loss of
DNA methylation induced by environmental pollutants in ro-
dents (22). However, to the best of our knowledge, whether B
vitamins can be used to limit adverse effects from PM pollution
has not previously been tested in human. Our research provided
the experimental evidence showing that the epigenetic effects of
PM2.5 can be reduced using 4-wk B-vitamin supplementation.
Remarkably, in our data, the B-vitamin supplementation not
only prevented decreased DNA methylation but also increased
DNA methylation following acute exposure to high-concentration
PM. These findings suggest that B vitamins might protect against
DNA hypomethylation as methyl group-supplying nutrients. On
the other hand, B vitamins might also minimize DNA hyper-
methylation through interactions with regulatory pathways medi-
ated by essential enzymes (such as DNA methyltransferases and
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase).
A major innovation of the present study over previous human
epigenome-wide studies is the use of isolated CD4+ Th cells—an
essential cell type modulating human immunity through both its
own immune activities and regulation of other leukocytes’ pro-
liferation, apoptosis, migration, and other functions via cytokine
signaling (31). Therefore, the epigenetic effects of PM2.5 and
protective effects of B vitamins observed in CD4+ Th genome
might indicate subsequent modulation of essential cellular
functions of other blood cell types. The Houseman cell pro-
portion estimates indicated high purity of the analyzed samples.
Although our study is subject to residual influence from differ-
ential CD4+ Th subsets, the observed effect of PM2.5 or B vita-
mins on DNA methylation is unlikely to be surrogate for
leukocyte composition variation. Our plating scheme for DNA
methylation analysis is independent of the exposure and treat-
ment status, and was designed to minimize potential bias due to
technical variables. Thus, the measurement error of DNA
methylation can be assumed to be nondifferential and, therefore,
likely to bias the results toward null. We conducted sensitivity
analysis to robustly evaluate the impact of PM2.5 on top loci, and
further supported the EWAS results with a widely accepted
mitochondrial marker—mitochondrial DNA content—with a
highly reproducible quantitative real-time PCR method. Our

 crossover design controlled for time-invariant factors such as sex,
race, BMI, SNP, etc. In addition, all exposure experiments were
conducted at the same time of the day to eliminate any impact
due to diurnal variation.
We acknowledge several limitations in the present pilot study.
Although our EWAS is limited in power to meet the stringent
Bonferroni threshold for significance with only 10 volunteers
(30 exposure experiments), our sample size is comparable to
previous controlled exposure studies that succeeded in demon-
strating health effects of PM exposure (28, 38–40). As suggested
by previous study (23), we selected the top loci based on both
effect size and statistical significance, because those loci are
more likely to infer biological significance. The short study du-
ration was implemented to reduce the impact of with-in volun-
teer seasonal variations. Therefore, we could not randomize on
the treatment (placebo vs. B vitamins) order due to long bi-
ological half-life of body stores of B vitamins (26), which might
create potential confounding due to a temporal trend or learning
effect (i.e., the volunteers might be more tolerant with the PM2.5
effects at the second PM2.5 exposure). In the sensitivity analysis,
we adjusted for the amount of time passing because the study
entry, and our results were consistent. Although residual con-
founding is possible, considering the magnitude of our effect
estimates and the consistency of our findings, it is unlikely that
the observed association reflected bias resulting from con-
founding. In addition, actual PM2.5 concentration in PM2.5 ex-
periments under placebo was nonsignificantly lower than PM2.5
experiments under B-vitamin supplementation, which might bias
our results on B vitamins’ protective effects toward the null.
Finally, future validation studies are warranted because our
unique study design using CD4+ Th cells created major challenge
to identify a suitable replication cohort, and our findings might
not be generalizable to other cell types due to cell-type specificity
of DNA methylation and mitochondrial DNA content.
The unclear molecular mechanistic underpinning of PM2.5’s
health effects remains the major gap in current knowledge—thereby
creating challenges in developing preventative strategies. The pre-
sent study is a pilot intervention trial in the investigation of mech-
anistic pathways underlying the adverse health effects of air
pollution, and potential targeted preventive approaches. We dem-
onstrated that ambient PM2.5 exposure peak has unfavorable effects
on epigenetic and pro-oxidative markers that can be neutralized by
B-vitamin supplementation. Our findings suggest promising oppor-
tunities to aid the development of novel intervention strategies—
which is particularly important for pathologies related to ubiquitous
exposures such as PM2.5 pollution. Future trials with larger sample
sizes are warranted to shed light on the precise pathophysiological
processes of PM-induced inflammatory and oxidative responses, the
mechanism underlying the protective effect of B vitamins, and po-
tential clinical application.
Methods
Study Population. We recruited 10 healthy, 18- to 60-y-old, nonsmoking
volunteers who were not taking any medicines or vitamin supplements, from
the University of Toronto campus and surrounding area. The trial protocols
were approved by all participating institutional review board (University of
Toronto, St. Michael’s Hospital, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health) and registered (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01864824; date of
registration: May 8, 2013). All methods were performed in accordance with
the relevant guidelines and regulations. We obtained written informed
consent from every volunteer before enrollment.
Study Design. We conducted a single-blind, crossover intervention trial with
controlled exposure experiments to concentrated ambient PM2.5 (July
2013 to February 2014). The design (Fig. 1) started with a 2-wk run-in period
with placebo, followed by the baseline sham experiment (2 h, particle-free
medical air, exposure one). After sham experiment, each volunteer took
placebo for 4 wk and was then exposed to PM2.5 (2 h, target concentration:
250 μg/m3, exposure two). Volunteers started the 4-wk B-vitamin
supplementation after exposure two, and then were exposed again to
PM2.5 (2 h, target concentration: 250 μg/m3, exposure three). All volunteers
received three exposure experiments following the same order.
Exposure Facility. Ambient particles were drawn in from an inlet 1.5 m high,
beside a busy (>1,000 vehicles per hour) street in downtown Toronto. We
used the Harvard ambient particle concentrator to generate concentrated
ambient PM2.5 (41), and delivered PM2.5 air stream to the volunteer seated
inside a 4.9-m3 (1.1 × 1.9 × 2.0 m) lexan enclosure via an “oxygen type”
facemask. The sham exposure with medical air were generated as previously
described (38). During each exposure experiment, PM2.5 mass was collected
on a 47-mm, 2-μm Teflon filter (Teflo, R2PJ047; Pall Corp.) and was moni-
tored using the gravimetric determination of PM2.5 exposure mass concen-
tration (micrograms per cubic meter).
Folic Acid, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12 Supplement. We administered one
placebo or B-vitamin supplement (2.5 mg of folic acid, 50 mg of vitamin B6,
and 1 mg of vitamin B12) daily to each volunteer. Previous human trials
showed that these doses rapidly increased plasma B-vitamin levels, modified
methyl-cycle metabolite levels, and ameliorated cardiovascular measure-
ments (42, 43). Preparation, packaging, and coding of the placebo and
supplement were done by an external laboratory (Jamieson Laboratories)
and was blinded to the volunteers. Before each exposure experiment, we
measured volunteers’ plasma folic acid and vitamin B12 levels using
competitive-binding immunoenzymatic assay (A98032 and 33000; Beckman
Coulter), and vitamin B12 levels using HPLC with fluorescence detection. At
the first and the last visit, we assessed typical daily B-vitamin intake with a
self-administered validated (44), semiquantitative food-frequency ques-
tionnaire used in the Nurses’ Health Study.
CD4+ Th Cell Isolation and DNA Extraction. We collected blood samples via
venous phlebotomy (preexposure, immediately postexposure, and 24 h
postexposure), and within 4 h, isolated CD4+ Th cells by removing unwanted
cells using RosetteSep Human CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Mixture (no. 15062;
Stem Cell Technologies). DNA was then extracted using a Promega Maxwell
16 instrument with tissue DNA purification kit (Promega). We monitored the
concentration and quality of extracted DNA using NanoDrop ND-1000 spec-
trophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). Unsatisfactory DNA samples were
discarded and DNA was extracted again. We estimated the proportions of
major leukocyte types (CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, granulocytes,
monocytes, and natural killer cells) to assess the purity of isolated CD4+ Th
cells using the Houseman method, a statistical deconvolution technique
based on the 450K data (11).
Epigenome-Wide DNA Methylation Scan. We measured the epigenome-wide
DNA methylation profile using the Infinium Human Methylation 450K
BeadChip (Illumina) (45), which allows the assessment of approximately half
a million CpG sites across 99% of RefSeq genes within the genome (46).
Because of the within-volunteer, cross-over design, we plated all samples
from one volunteer in one chip, with pre- and postexposure samples ran-
domly loaded onto each column on the same row. All samples were pro-
cessed by one technician and analyzed in one batch to minimize batch
effect. Sample preparation and quality control details are explained in
SI Methods.
Mitochondrial DNA Content in CD4+ Th Cells. We measured mitochondrial DNA
content in CD4+ Th cells through the mtDNA/nDNA ratio, a widely used
biomarker representing the mitochondrial DNA copy number versus the
nuclear DNA copy number (34). Mitochondrial DNA copy number was ana-
lyzed pre, immediately after, and 24 h after each exposure experiment using
multiplex quantitative real-time PCR, as previously reported (34). The
mtDNA/nDNA is used in the statistical analysis—a ratio value of 1 indicates
that the mtDNA/nDNA of the test sample is equal to the mtDNA/nDNA in
the reference DNA pool used in the assay.
CD4+ Th Mitochondrial DNA Content and DNA Methylation in External Dataset.
To strengthen our findings, we identified an external dataset based on 15 de-
identified volunteers’ CD4+ T cells—which were purified from fresh blood
samples through magnetic-activated cell sorting using anti-CD4 antibody
coupled paramagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Epigenome-wide DNA
methylation profiles and mitochondrial DNA content were measured using
the same methods of the present study.

 Statistical Methods. We used linear mixed-effects models (SI Methods) with
random intercepts assigned to each volunteer to account for correlation among
within-volunteer measurements. The crossover design minimized the influence
from time-invariant factors. In all models, we adjusted for time-varying cova-
riates with potential influences on DNA methylation, selected based on prior
knowledge and the existing literature [i.e., season (fall/winter/spring/summer),
chamber temperature, and chamber relative humidity (38)]. Rank-based normal
transformation was performed on all DNA methylation measures to improve
normality and stabilize the variance. We further performed permutation tests on
the observed top two loci to ensure the robustness of our results, and conducted
exploratory mediation analysis to evaluate whether DNA methylation mediates
the effect of PM2.5 on mitochondrial DNA content (SI Methods). Analyses were
performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R statistical computing software (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing).
