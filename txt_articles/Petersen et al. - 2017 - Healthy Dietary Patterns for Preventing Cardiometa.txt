Abstract
Diets rich in plant foods are increasingly recommended to lower the risk of cardiometabolic
diseases because of strong evidence that fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and
seeds are protective. Although some animal products, such as unprocessed lean red meat,
poultry, eggs, and dairy products, are recommended in dietary patterns to prevent
cardiometabolic diseases, many health professionals advocate for exclusively plant-based dietary
patterns. The aim of this article was to review recent evidence on the relative contributions of
plant-based foods and animal products to a healthy dietary pattern. Secondary aims were to
discuss current consumption patterns and adherence to dietary recommendations.
Epidemiologic evidence suggests that a higher intake of plant-based foods is associated with a
lower risk of cardiometabolic disease, whereas a higher meat intake increases the risk of
cardiometabolic disease and the replacement of small quantities of animal protein with plant
protein is associated with lower risk. Randomized controlled studies show that nutrient-dense
diets containing animal protein, including some unprocessed lean meats, improve cardiovascular
disease risk factors. Therefore, it is likely that the consumption of animal products, at
recommended amounts, in the context of a dietary pattern that meets recommendations for fruit,
vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes, and does not exceed recommendations for
added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat, may not increase cardiometabolic risk. Currently,
adherence to these recommendations is suboptimal. Therefore, rather than debating the merits
of healthy dietary patterns that are exclusively plant-based or that include animal sources in
recommended amounts, the focus should be on improving overall eating patterns to align with
dietary guidelines. Registered Dietitian/Nutritionists (RDNs) have the requisite nutrition expertise
to facilitate change at the individual and population levels to promote adherence to healthy
dietary patterns. Importantly, advocacy activities are urgently needed to create a healthier food
environment, and all health professionals, including RDNs, must play a role.

Introduction
Poor dietary practices are a leading risk factor for illness, disability, and death worldwide and
in the United States (1, 2). As such, defining dietary patterns that improve health and reduce
chronic disease is of major scientific and public health importance. However, equally impor-
tant, but often forgotten, is identifying healthful dietary patterns that can be followed by the
general population. There is significant evidence that shows that dietary recommendations
are not being met in many countries and that consumption of “empty calories” (i.e., foods
high in solid fats and added sugars) is increasing globally (3). In many countries, including
the United States, dietary guidelines are moving away from nutrient-based recommendations

 in favor of dietary pattern–based recommendations. Recommended
dietary patterns are rich in plant-based foods such as fruit, vegeta-
bles, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, soy products, and vegetable
oils (4–7). They also include moderate amounts of fat-free or low-fat
dairy. Many countries also recommend a variety of protein foods, in-
cluding seafood, lean meats, poultry, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, and
soy products. There is strong evidence that fruit, nonstarchy vegeta-
bles, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes have beneficial health
effects and higher consumption is associated with a lower risk of
cardiometabolic disease (8–13). Consequently, many organizations
now recommend a diet that emphasizes plant foods (14, 15). There
is ongoing scientific debate, however, about the health effects of
some animal products, such as unprocessed red meat, poultry,
eggs, and dairy products (16). The purpose of this article was to re-
view recent evidence on the relative contributions of plant-based
foods and animal products to a healthy dietary pattern. Secondary
aims were to discuss these findings in the context of current con-
sumption patterns and adherence to dietary recommendations.
The important role of Registered Dietitian/Nutritionists (RDNs) in
helping individuals and the population adhere to current dietary
guidelines will be described briefly.
Epidemiologic Evidence for the Association between
Consumption of Plant-Based Foods and Animal Products
and Cardiometabolic Disease
A significant body of epidemiologic evidence has shown that dietary
patterns that are high in plant foods, including fruit, vegetables, nuts,
seeds, whole grains, legumes, and soy products, are associated with a
lower risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and type 2 di-
abetes (17–19). In addition, many observational studies have shown
that vegetarians are at a lower risk of numerous chronic conditions
than those who consume a dietary pattern high in meat products
(20). A recent study showed that higher plant protein intake was as-
sociated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and CVD mortality
(21). A 3% increase in plant protein intake was associated with a 10%
reduction (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95) in all-cause mortality and a 12%
(95% CI: 0.80, 0.97) lower risk of CVD mortality. Conversely, a 10%
increase in animal protein intake was associated with an 8% increase
in the risk of CVD mortality (95% CI: 1.01, 1.16) and a nonsignificant
2% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI: 0.98, 1.05). A
limitation of these analyses is that the dietary replacement for plant
and animal protein was not considered. Implicit to this is that animal
protein could have increased, whereas plant protein could have de-
creased and vice versa. There are many other replacement scenarios
as well that call for further research to be conducted. Further sub-
group analysis showed that higher animal protein intake only in-
creased the risk of CVD mortality in people with an unhealthy
lifestyle, which was defined as smoking for .5 pack-years (equal
to 1 pack/d for 5 y), high alcohol consumption (.14 g/d in women
and .28 g/d in men), BMI (in kg/m2) .27.5, or ,150 min physical
activity/wk. In contrast, higher plant protein intake was only associ-
ated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
mortality in people with an unhealthy lifestyle. In those who had a
healthy lifestyle, intake of plant or animal protein was not associated
with all-cause mortality or CVD mortality after adjustment for
potential confounders. Because the majority of people in high-
income countries have an unhealthy lifestyle, based on BMI and
physical inactivity alone (22, 23), the results of this study suggest
that replacing animal protein with plant protein may reduce mortal-
ity risk. In a prospective cohort study in US health professionals,
Song et al. (21) showed that replacing 3% of energy from animal pro-
tein sources, including unprocessed red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and
dairy, with plant protein was associated with a 6–19% reduction in
the risk of all-cause mortality; similar risk reductions were observed
for CVD mortality. This suggests that substituting a small percentage
of animal protein with plant protein may reduce the risk of all-cause
and cardiovascular death in high-income countries (24).
Higher animal protein intake has also been associated with an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes, such that per 5% increase in an-
imal protein consumption, the risk of type 2 diabetes increases by
15% (95% CI: 1.00, 1.33) (25). In this study, the intake of plant pro-
tein was not associated with the development of type 2 diabetes
after adjustment for standard risk factors and consumption of en-
ergy, fiber, and saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsatu-
rated fat, trans fat, and animal protein. A recent meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies also showed an increased risk of type
2 diabetes with higher total protein intake (RR: 1.09; 95% CI:
1.06, 1.13) and animal protein intake (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.28),
whereas there was no association for plant protein intake (RR:
0.95; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.02) (25). Because plant-based foods contain
many cardioprotective vitamins, minerals, nutrients, and bioac-
tives, in addition to protein, which is not an underconsumed nutri-
ent in high-income countries, diets rich in plant-based foods
should be evaluated in terms of their overall nutritional quality.
Similarly, the overall quality of diets high in animal products
should be considered, because many animal products are rich in
nutrients and also do not increase the risk of cardiometabolic dis-
ease. In fact, similar to plant-based foods, some of the components
of animal sources are protective (16).
Epidemiologic evidence shows that red and processed meats
are associated with an increased risk of CVD and type 2 diabetes
(21, 26, 27), whereas poultry, eggs, fish, and dairy do not increase
CVD risk or CVD mortality (21, 26, 28–31). In fact, fish and dairy
consumption has been associated with a lower risk of CVD and
CVD death (29–31). No association has been found between the in-
take of fish and type 2 diabetes, but dairy intake may be protective
against type 2 diabetes (32, 33). However, there is some evidence
to suggest that eggs may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, espe-
cially in US populations (34, 35). At present, evidence suggests that
red meat consumption is strongly associated with a greater risk of
cardiometabolic disease. Therefore, when considering the cardio-
metabolic effect of consuming a dietary pattern containing animal
products, it is important to recognize that the associated risk may
depend on the type of animal product consumed.
The evidence that shows an adverse association between ani-
mal protein and a number of major chronic diseases is derived
from observational studies and therefore is subject to confound-
ing. Thus, it is unclear whether a causative relation exists. It has
been hypothesized that the association between meat consump-
tion and higher risk of cardiometabolic diseases may be due to

 meat consumption being a marker of an overall less healthy
diet and lifestyle, rather than meat consumption per se. In the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC)–Oxford cohort, it was observed that meat eaters had the
highest consumption of energy, protein, fat, and saturated fat
and the lowest intake of fiber and PUFAs when compared with
fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans (36). This study suggests that
meat consumers have poorer overall diet quality, which was also
observed in a Finnish cohort whereby greater meat consumption
was associated with lower overall diet quality after adjustment
for age, energy intake, physical activity, smoking, and education
(37). In this cohort, there was a direct relation between higher
consumption of meat and higher physical inactivity, BMI, waist
circumference, and percentage body weight. The relation between
red and processed meat and BMI persisted after adjustment for
age, physical activity, education, smoking, and intakes of nuts
and seeds, fruit, oil, coffee, whole grains, and potatoes. Recently,
it was shown in French adults that greater plant protein intake
was independently associated with greater dietary diversity and
higher nutrient adequacy (38). In this study, the difference be-
tween animal protein intake in the highest and lowest quartile
of nutrient adequacy was 7% of total energy intake, indicating
that relatively small reductions in animal protein intake in favor
of plant protein improve nutritional adequacy. In summary, the
epidemiologic evidence showing that higher meat consumption
is associated with mortality and chronic disease development
may be confounded by other diet and lifestyle factors, but mod-
estly reducing meat consumption and including more plant-
based foods will improve overall dietary quality and may reduce
diet-related diseases.
Dietary Patterns Containing Animal Products and
Plant-Based Foods
The results of epidemiologic research are likely influenced by con-
founding; therefore, to establish the cardiometabolic effects of diets
containing plant-based foods and animal products, well-controlled
clinical trials provide the highest evidence. The Dietary Approaches
to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet is a nutrient-dense dietary pat-
tern that emphasizes the consumption of fruit, vegetables, whole
grains, and low-fat dairy products and limits the consumption of
red meat, sweets, and snacks (39). Although this diet limits red
meat consumption (0.5 servings red meat/d), approximately two-
thirds of total protein intake is obtained from animal products (prin-
cipally from 2.7 servings dairy/d). In the original controlled feeding
study, the DASH diet reduced blood pressure to a greater extent
than did the control diet (25.5/3.0 mm Hg) after 8 wk in subjects
with pre- and stage 1 hypertension (40). The control diet had a mac-
ronutrient profile similar to the average American diet and included
0.5 servings dairy/d and 1.5 servings red meat/d. Interestingly, the
DASH diet also reduced blood pressure more than did a high fruit
and vegetable diet (22.7/1.9 mmHg), which had a macronutrient
profile similar to the average American diet but included 8.5 servings
fruit and vegetables/d, 0.3 servings dairy/d, and 1.8 servings red
meat/d. These results show that including low-fat dairy as part of
a diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables and low in saturated fat im-
proves blood pressure more than an average American diet rich in
fruit and vegetables.
Subsequently, Carey et al. (41) investigated the blood pressure
and lipid effects of 3 healthful dietary patterns (all low in saturated
fat) differing in protein, carbohydrate, and unsaturated fat content
(OmniHeart Study). The high-carbohydrate diet (58% of total en-
ergy) was based on the DASH diet, whereas the high-protein diet
and the high-unsaturated-fat diets replaced 10% of the calories
from carbohydrates with protein or unsaturated fat, respectively.
The high-protein diet included 50% of total protein from plant
sources. All of the diets were high in fruit, vegetables, and grains
and contained ;1 serving red meat/d. It should be noted that
the high-carbohydrate diet included 4.6 servings desserts and
sweets/d compared with 2.5 and 1.7 servings/d in the protein
and unsaturated-fat diets, respectively. In this study, the high-
protein and unsaturated-fat diets lowered blood pressure, total
cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and TGs more than did the
high-carbohydrate diet (42). Although all of the test diets lowered
10-y coronary artery disease risk, it was reduced to a greater ex-
tent by the high-protein and unsaturated-fat diets than with the
high-carbohydrate diet. These controlled feeding studies showed
that nutrient-dense, high-quality diets that include animal pro-
ducts can improve risk factors for CVD, thereby reducing the
overall risk of CVD.
The DASH diet has also been tested in free-living populations.
In the PREMIER study, individuals with pre- and stage 1 hyperten-
sion were provided with education and counseling to implement
key components of the DASH diet; in addition, goals were set
for weight loss, physical activity, and alcohol consumption (43).
This was compared with a group who only had goals for weight
loss, physical activity, and alcohol consumption and an advice-only
control group. Subjects received weekly group sessions for the first
8 wk, followed by biweekly sessions until the 6-mo time point;
monthly sessions were then held for the final 12 mo. After 18 mo, in-
takes of fruit (+1.8 servings/d), vegetables (+1.1 servings/d), and dairy
products (+0.3 servings/d) were increased from baseline in the DASH
diet group, but not to amounts recommended in the original DASH
diet (9–12 servings fruit and vegetables/d, 2–3 servings dairy/d) and
achieved in the controlled-feeding study (44). Compared with sub-
jects in the group who only had goals for weight reduction, increasing
physical activity, and reducing alcohol consumption, there was no ad-
ditional blood pressure–lowering effect for those who were in the
group who also implemented key components of the DASH diet
(45). Compared with the advice-only control group, systolic and
diastolic blood pressures were reduced by 4.3 mm Hg (95% CI:
25.9, 22.8 mm Hg) and 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI: 23.7, 21.5 mm Hg),
respectively, in subjects in the DASH group. Similar reductions of
3.7 mm Hg (95% CI: 25.3, 22.1 mm Hg) and 1.7 mm Hg (95% CI:
22.8, 20.6 mm Hg) for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respec-
tively, were observed in the group who had lifestyle goals. This study
showed that it was challenging for free-living individuals to imple-
ment a dietary pattern consistent with the DASH recommendations,
which has been shown in a number of other free-living populations as
well (46). Nonetheless, there were positive steps made toward adher-
ence to a DASH diet.

 In America, beef is commonly consumed and there was some
concern that the restriction placed on red meat in the DASH
diet may hamper compliance in this population. In the Beef in
an Optimal Lean Diet (BOLD) study, a DASH diet with 28, 113,
or 153 g lean beef/d lowered total and LDL cholesterol, compared
with a control healthy American diet, with no difference between
the diets after 5 wk (47). The apo profile was also improved after
consumption of the lean beef–containing diets compared with the
healthy American diet. The BOLD study included normotensive
and prehypertensive subjects, and after consumption of the diet
containing 153 g lean beef/d, systolic blood pressure was lower
(24.2 mm Hg) than after the other 3 diets (48). In addition, aug-
mentation index, a measure of arterial stiffness, was lower after
the diet containing 113 g lean beef/d than with the other diets.
These results suggest that that the inclusion of lean beef as part
of a healthy dietary pattern can reduce CVD risk factors. However,
it is important to note that these effects were achieved under
controlled-feeding conditions and might be more difficult to
achieve in a free-living setting. In addition, the diets that included
lean beef were also designed to limit saturated fat intake (6% of to-
tal energy) and “empty calorie” foods while providing large quan-
tities of fruit and vegetables (;8 cups/d) and grains (5.3–
5.6 ounces/d). The diet that provided 153 g lean beef/d also included
4.2 ounces legumes, nuts, seeds, and vegetable protein/d, and
4.7 cups low-fat dairy products. Therefore, these diets contained
many nutrient-dense foods in addition to the lean beef, and this
combination, together with the lower saturated fat content of
the diets, likely explains the observed lipid-lowering effects. It re-
mains unclear, however, whether a free-living population would
be able to follow this dietary pattern over the long term.
Two other trials conducted in free-living populations have also
shown that DASH diets including lean red meat (beef or pork) im-
prove blood pressure. Sayer et al. (49) observed that blood pressure
was lowered to a similar extent with a DASH diet that included
55% of total protein from lean pork compared with a DASH diet
that included the same amount of protein from lean chicken and
fish after 6 wk in healthy men and women with hypertension. Simi-
larly, a DASH diet containing lean red meat (six 100-g servings/wk)
was more effective at lowering blood pressure in postmenopausal
women after 14 wk than a healthy reference diet (50). However, it
should be noted that the healthy reference diet in this study included
,2 servings red meat/wk, less fruit and vegetables, and more fats and
oils, refined carbohydrates, and sodium than the DASH group. There-
fore, it is likely that the blood pressure–lowering effects observed in
the study by Nowson et al. (50) was due to the higher fruit and veg-
etable consumption and lower sodium intake in the DASH group
compared with the reference diet.
Current Population Consumption and Adherence to Dietary
Guidelines
Epidemiologic research shows that higher meat consumption is asso-
ciated with lower consumption of nutrient-dense foods, particularly
fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products. However,
data from controlled-feeding studies show that when lean red meat
is consumed as part of a dietary pattern that meets food-based dietary
recommendations and limits saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar,
risk factors for CVD are improved. Therefore, rather than focusing on
the contribution of single foods or dietary components in isolation,
the totality of the diet should be considered. Ultimately, there are
multiple dietary patterns that are healthful and individuals should
choose the one they can follow long term. In the 2015–2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans, 3 dietary patterns are included: the healthy
US-style diet, the healthy Mediterranean-style eating pattern, and the
healthy vegetarian eating pattern (4). Each of these dietary patterns
meets nutrient requirements, although the foods recommended in
each differ, albeit slightly. Identifying dietary patterns that are associ-
ated with better cardiometabolic health is not the challenge; rather,
improving population adherence to healthful dietary patterns is the
obstacle.
Current data show that population consumption patterns mark-
edly diverge from recommendations for cardiometabolic disease pre-
vention (51). In the United States, the consumption of vegetables, fruit,
dairy products, legumes, whole grains, and seafood is far lower than
recommended. In addition, intakes of meats, poultry, eggs, refined
grains, solid fats, added sugar, and sodium are much higher than rec-
ommended. In quantitative terms, the average intake of fruit and veg-
etables is 115 and 183 g/d, respectively (52), whereas 300 g fruit/d and
400 g vegetables/d are recommended (4). Similarly, intakes of nuts
and seeds (;12 g/d) and whole grains (21 g/d) are well below recom-
mended amounts of ;20 g/d (5 ounces/wk) and 125 g/d, respectively
(4, 52). In comparison, Americans consume ;47 g unprocessed red
meat/d and 31 g processed meat/d, whereas evidence shows that
the lowest risk of cardiometabolic disease is observed when red
meat consumption is ,100 g/wk (14 g/d), and processed meat should
not be consumed (4, 52). Furthermore, 90% of individuals in the
United States consume discretionary foods on a daily basis; and among
consumers, the average intake of discretionary food items is ;500 kcal/d
or one-quarter of total energy intake (53). This shows that to improve
overall adherence to the dietary guidelines and diet quality there needs
to be a shift in consumption patterns to include more nutrient-dense
foods and less “empty calorie” foods, which are high in calories, added
sugar, refined carbohydrates, and solid fats. In total, the current US
diet is high in energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and low in fruit,
vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (2015) identified the
following nutrients as being underconsumed in the United States: vita-
min A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C, folate, calcium, magnesium, fi-
ber, and potassium (54). For adolescent females and premenopausal
women, iron is also an underconsumed nutrient. Plant-based foods
are good sources of many of these shortfall nutrients, although dairy
products and lean meat are high in calcium and iron, respectively.
This further indicates that the consumption of fruit, vegetables, nuts,
seeds, and whole grains needs to increase and replace nutrient-poor
food choices.
Achieving Healthful Dietary Patterns
Many factors influence what foods an individual chooses to con-
sume and their overall dietary pattern. Thus, to achieve meaningful

 changes in population dietary habits there needs to be intervention
at the individual level, but health system changes and strong public
policy are also required (16). A recent meta-analysis showed that a
10% price decrease (i.e., a subsidy) on healthy foods increased con-
sumption by 12% (95% CI: 10%, 15%), and a 10% price increase (i.e., a
tax) in the cost of unhealthy foods reduced consumption by 6%
(95% CI: 4%, 8%) (55). Afshin et al. (55) also showed that reducing
the price of fruit and vegetables by 10% increased consumption by
14% (95% CI: 11%, 17%). The American Heart Asssociation cites level
1A evidence for economic incentives that lower the cost of more
healthy foods and beverages and level 2B evidence for increasing
the price of unhealthy foods (56). In addition, cost-effectiveness
modeling based on the Australian population showed that taxes
and subsidies on foods and beverages are effective ways to im-
prove population health and reduce health care expenditures
(57). Other ways to improve population dietary intake are as fol-
lows: media and education strategies, mandated nutritional label-
ing and front-of-pack labeling, interventions targeted at schools
and workplaces, increased availability of healthy foods and re-
duced prevalence of food deserts, regulation of food marketing
and advertising to children, and regulation of food industry en-
dorsement and sponsorship of children’s sporting and leisure ac-
tivities (56). Many of these strategies target the food industry to
encourage reformulation and development of healthier products;
thus, the role of the food industry must be considered in public
health efforts to improve diet quality (58).
An example of how the food industry can influence population
intake is the change in trans fat content in food products in re-
sponse to the FDA-mandated labeling of trans fat on the Nutrition
Facts panel (59). In 2006, the FDA introduced this mandate and,
since this time, there has been a reduction in the trans fat content
of the food supply (60, 61). In 2013, the FDA further determined
that partially hydrogenated vegetable oils were no longer “gener-
ally recognized as safe” (62), which means that food manufac-
turers will no longer be able to use partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil in their products, further reducing trans fat content
in the food supply. The UK salt reduction program is another
example of how product reformulation by the food industry can
influence population intake and health outcomes. The UK salt
reduction program had many components, but notably engaged
the food industry and specific salt targets were set for product cat-
egories, with clear time frames for the targets to be achieved (63).
The initiative was voluntary, with the threat of legislation, and
companies that achieved the targets were praised and those that
did not were publicly named and shamed. In the United Kingdom,
salt intake was reduced from 9.5 g/d in 2001 to 8.6 g/d in 2008, and
by a further 0.5 g (6%) to 8.1 g/d in 2011 (63, 64). It has been estimated
that, as a result of this salt reduction program, there are 9000 fewer
cardiovascular deaths per year in the United Kingdom (63).
The Role of RDNs in Improving Population-Level Dietary
Intake
There is evidence of marked benefits to the food supply and the
overall diet of the population as a result of policy interventions.
RDNs can work to improve the overall food environment by advo-
cating for stronger public health policies while also influencing die-
tary consumption patterns at the individual level. At an individual
level, RDNs help patients and clients follow a dietary pattern that
suits their specific needs and meets nutrient requirements. This in-
dividualized dietary prescription may also include education about
recipe modification and cooking methods to achieve recommended
intakes of foods and nutrients on the basis of specific needs. There is
also a role for RDNs in influencing population health by advocating
for healthy food environments, which may involve communicating
with legislators, elected officials, and others who influence policy
and legislation (65). Furthermore, when new policies or guidelines
are introduced, RDNs can help to communicate the changes to indi-
viduals and the general public. RDNs can also work to translate re-
search findings into practice. A recent systematic review that aimed
to determine how nutrition-related evidence for the prevention and
treatment of CVD is translated into practice showed that there are
few data on how dietary knowledge is being translated to users
(66). This is likely due to limited reporting of methods used to trans-
late nutrition knowledge into practice rather than a lack of transla-
tion altogether. However, detailed and accurate reporting of the
effectiveness of the different methods used to translate nutrition
knowledge into practice is needed to facilitate successful, timely
translation of research findings. Because RDNs work in many set-
tings, including health care, the community, food service, industry,
and research, they are uniquely positioned to facilitate the transla-
tion of evidence-based nutrition research into clinical practice and
population-based strategies to achieve sustainable improvements
in dietary consumption patterns (67).
Conclusions
Epidemiologic evidence suggests that plant-based diets are associ-
ated with a lower risk of cardiometabolic disease and that individ-
uals with higher meat intakes are at greater risk of CVD; however,
it is unclear whether this relation is indicative of a causative effect
or due to other diet and lifestyle factors that differ between high-
and low-meat consumers. Nonetheless, these studies show that
small increases in plant-based foods reduce CVD risk. Data from
randomized controlled trials with hard endpoints are not available,
but well-controlled studies of intermediate outcomes have shown
that nutrient-dense diets that contain animal protein, including
some unprocessed lean meat, do not have adverse effects and may
improve risk factors for CVD. Therefore, it is likely that the con-
sumption of animal products (excluding processed red meats) at rec-
ommended amounts in the context of a dietary pattern that meets
recommendations for fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds,
and legumes and does not exceed recommendations for added sugar,
sodium, and saturated fat may not adversely affect, and may benefit,
cardiometabolic risk. However, population adherence to these rec-
ommendations is markedly suboptimal. Therefore, improving intake
