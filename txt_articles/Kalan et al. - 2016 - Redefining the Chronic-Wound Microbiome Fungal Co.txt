ABSTRACT
Chronic nonhealing wounds have been heralded as a silent epidemic, causing significant morbidity and mortality
especially in elderly, diabetic, and obese populations. Polymicrobial biofilms in the wound bed are hypothesized to disrupt the
highly coordinated and sequential events of cutaneous healing. Both culture-dependent and -independent studies of the chronic-
wound microbiome have almost exclusively focused on bacteria, omitting what we hypothesize are important fungal contribu-
tions to impaired healing and the development of complications. Here we show for the first time that fungal communities (the
mycobiome) in chronic wounds are predictive of healing time, associated with poor outcomes, and form mixed fungal-bacterial
biofilms. We longitudinally profiled 100, nonhealing diabetic-foot ulcers with high-throughput sequencing of the pan-fungal
internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) locus, estimating that up to 80% of wounds contain fungi, whereas cultures performed in
parallel captured only 5% of colonized wounds. The “mycobiome” was highly heterogeneous over time and between subjects.
Fungal diversity increased with antibiotic administration and onset of a clinical complication. The proportions of the phylum
Ascomycota were significantly greater (P � 0.015) at the beginning of the study in wounds that took >8 weeks to heal. Wound
necrosis was distinctly associated with pathogenic fungal species, while taxa identified as allergenic filamentous fungi were asso-
ciated with low levels of systemic inflammation. Directed culturing of wounds stably colonized by pathogens revealed that in-
terkingdom biofilms formed between yeasts and coisolated bacteria. Combined, our analyses provide enhanced resolution of the
mycobiome during impaired wound healing, its role in chronic disease, and impact on clinical outcomes.
IMPORTANCE
Wounds are an underappreciated but serious complication for a diverse spectrum of diseases. High-risk groups,
such as persons with diabetes, have a 25% lifetime risk of developing a wound that can become chronic. The majority of micro-
biome research related to chronic wounds is focused on bacteria, but the association of fungi with clinical outcomes remains to
be elucidated. Here we describe the dynamic fungal communities in 100 diabetic patients with foot ulcers. We found that com-
munities are unstable over time, but at the first clinical presentation, the relative proportions of different phyla predict healing
times. Pathogenic fungi not identified by culture reside in necrotic wounds and are associated with a poor prognosis. In wounds
stably colonized by fungi, we identified yeasts capable of forming biofilms in concert with bacteria. Our findings illuminate the
associations of the fungal mycobiome with wound prognosis and healing.

I
n recent years, the implication of microorganisms in complex
human processes has begun to come into focus. Negative con-
sequences of these interactions can result in large health care bur-
dens such as nonhealing or chronic wounds (1–5). One example is
diabetic-foot ulcers (DFUs), which contribute to 80% of nontrau-
matic lower-extremity amputations and are associated with 5-year
mortality rates of 43 to 55%, higher than Hodgkin’s disease, breast
cancer, or prostate cancer (6–8). Chronic wounds are largely be-
lieved to be critically colonized by polymicrobial communities
that contribute to persistent inflammation and stalled healing
processes, significantly reducing the quality of life for those af-
flicted (9–11). Skin normally harbors diverse communities of mi-
crobes (12–17) that can contribute to health, but like other eco-
systems, the niche can direct composition and ultimately function
(18–20). In tissue injury, microbes enter the wound where the
physical environment differs from the skin surface in tempera-
ture, pH, nutrient availability, and host immune effectors. Here,
microbial metabolism can shift, providing opportunities for com-
mensal microbes to become virulent and community composi-
tion to fluctuate in response to host clinical factors (21–23). It is
hypothesized that once colonization occurs, these communities
form a biofilm within the wound, disrupting the coordinated tis-
sue regeneration process. This is also true in other chronic infec-
tions, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) where the environment of the

 lungs in CF patients allows for colonization (24), unlike the lungs
in healthy individuals, which can clear microbes.
Prior research has primarily focused on the role of bacterial
species in wound healing (10, 23, 25–30); however, skin is also
host to resident fungi, and our environment is rich with fungal
diversity (31–34). Many human commensal fungi or yeasts are
also opportunistic pathogens, and many species are known to be
prolific biofilm formers (34–38). There are few studies describing
the “mycobiome” portion of the human microbiome and its rela-
tion to health (32, 34, 39–41), while the incidence of fungal colo-
nization in chronic wounds is even less known. A previous cross-
sectional study of chronic wounds of mixed etiology and without
standardized treatment utilized molecular-biology-based meth-
ods to observe that up to 23% of chronic wounds contain fungi
(41). Chellan et al. studied 518 diabetic lower leg wounds and
detected fungi in 27% of samples with culture-based methodology
(42). In these studies, several aspects of the cross-sectional study
design limit the ability to draw conclusions. These designs pre-
clude longitudinal observation of fungal colonization and the re-
lationship to clinical outcomes (i.e., rate of healing, infection-
related complications), while controlling for clinical variables,
such as tissue perfusion or blood glucose control.
Here, we add a new perspective to the current models of im-
paired wound healing with a longitudinal study of 100 DFUs un-
der standardized treatment. High-throughput sequencing of the
nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) allowed us
to define the dynamic diversity of the mycobiome, its stability in
response to host factors, and the association of pathogenic fungi
with poor clinical outcomes.
RESULTS
Study overview. To minimize variability associated with wound
etiology, we limited our study to a single wound etiology consist-
ing solely of DFUs. Subjects were enrolled in the study, and wound
specimens were obtained every 2 weeks until the wounds healed,
another infection occurred, the wounds resulted in amputation,
or the wounds were not closed after 26 weeks (visit 0 to 12). Ta-
ble 1 summarizes the cohort where a total of 384 specimens were
collected from 100 DFUs in a sample of 100 subjects. Additional
clinical factors measured include white blood cell (WBC) count,
ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBPI), hemoglo-
bin A1c, glucose (HgbA1c), C-reactive protein, and transcutane-
ous oxygen levels of the wound edge. Monofilament testing
confirmed neuropathy in all subjects. Complications were experi-
enced by 31 (31%) subjects and were defined as follows: (i) wound
deterioration, (ii) development of osteomyelitis, and/or (iii) am-
putation.
The fungal component of DFU microbiomes was studied by
sequencing the hypervariable internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1)
region of the eukaryotic rRNA cistron using the Illumina MiSeq
platform (two 300-bp paired-end [PE] chemistry). The ITS region
has been formally recognized as the universal barcode for fungal
identification (43) so we elected to use this region and the curated
fungal bar code reference database UNITE (44) for operational
taxonomic unit (OTU) assignment. We employed the PIPITS
pipeline (45) because it extracts the ITS subregion from raw reads
and assigns taxonomy with a trained RDP Classifier (46). Of the
10,673,363 sequences, 10,593,779 sequences were identified as
containing an ITS1 subregion. DNA from Saccharomyces cerevi-
siae was detected in the medium in which the wound samples were
collected, and therefore, all OTUs identified at the genus or species
level as Saccharomyces were filtered from the data set, resulting in
removal of three phylotypes. After quality filtering and contami-
nant removal, 2,842,822 reads remained, resulting in 482 OTUs,
and taxonomic identification yielded 284 phylotypes.
Characterization of the DFU fungal mycobiome. Seventeen
phylotypes were identified at a relative abundance of �1% across
the entire data set, all belonging to the phylum Ascomycota or
Basidiomycota. The two most abundant species, both belonging to
the phylum Ascomycota, were Cladosporidium herbarum (teleo-
morph Davidiella tassiania), present in 41% of the samples and
56% of subjects, and Candida albicans (22% of samples and 47%
of subjects). Notably, 10 of the 17 most abundant taxa are Asco-
mycota filamentous fungi found ubiquitously in the environment,
while the most abundant Basidiomycota identified were the op-
portunistic yeast pathogens Trichosporon and Rhodosporidium
spp. (Table 2 and Fig. 1A).

 Malassezia species are reported as a major component of the
healthy skin mycobiome (32) and were detected at an abundance
of �0.05% in 26 subjects in a total of 36 specimens, but only seven
specimens had �10% relative abundance of Malassezia species.
This observation is not unexpected, as Malassezia spp. are lipid
dependent, and the foot is known to have overall lower abun-
dances of Malassezia spp. relative to other body site niches (32,
47), in part due to absence of sebum in this microenvironment
and in the wound itself.
A major current limitation of molecular DNA sequencing-
based analysis of the mycobiota is the representation of fungal
species in available reference databases. It is estimated that se-
quence data are available for a mere 1.5% of the estimated 1.5
million fungal species (46). Indeed, 32% of the DFU samples con-
tained OTUs that could not be assigned beyond the kingdom level,
and 16% of samples contained OTUs unclassified beyond phylum
Ascomycota (Table 2).
Limitations of reference databases necessitate the use of
reference-independent analyses to characterize diversity and vari-
ation of fungal communities. Alpha diversity metrics use

Downloaded from 
 reference-independent OTU data to summarize diversity, such as
the number of OTUs in a sample and their evenness. We analyzed
DFU mycobiome alpha diversity with respect to wound health
and inflammation factors measured at the patient and ulcer level
(see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the supplemental material). At the first
or baseline visit (visit 0), diversity measured as the number of
observed species-level OTUs (median, 6; range, 1 to 21) and
Faith’s phylogenetic distance (PD) (median, 4.64; range, 1.31 to
14.92) was negatively associated with tissue oxygenation (rho �
�0.258 and P � 0.046 and rho � �0.295 and P � 0.022, respec-
tively) (Fig. S1), suggesting that high fungal diversity is associated
with poor perfusion.
As measured by the Shannon diversity index, which takes into
account both richness and evenness of OTUs, ulcers on the fore-
foot were more diverse (median, 1.03; range, 0 to 3.83) than ulcers
on the hind foot (median, 0.51; range, 0 to 1.65) (P � 0.02 by
Wilcoxon rank sum test) with midfoot ulcers falling in between
(median, 0.95; range, 0 to 3.15) to create a gradient of diversity
(Fig. 1B). The number of observed species-level OTUs did not
differ significantly between the forefoot and hind foot, indicating
that the evenness of differentially abundant OTUs contributes to
topographical variability of the mycobiome. Decreased Shannon
diversity appears to be driven primarily by a significant increase in
the relative abundance of C. albicans in ulcers formed on the hind
foot (Fig. 1C; see Table S2 in the supplemental material).
At each study visit, wound specimens were also collected for
quantitative cultures. Three subjects were culture positive for
yeast isolates categorized as “skin flora” or “other,” and two sub-
jects were positive for Candida sp. at one study visit. In all five
cases, the study visit positive for yeast culture was concurrent with
or preceded the study visit where a complication was observed (see
Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). With a culture-independent
sequence-based approach, after quality and contaminant filtering,
275 of the 384 specimens analyzed, corresponding to 79 subjects,
were positive for at least one fungal phylotype (Table 1). The
culture-positive specimens were confirmed by ITS1 sequencing to
contain high relative abundances of Candida spp. (C. albicans and
C. glabrata) with the exception of one subject specimen contain-
ing primarily Trichosporon asahii. Our analysis identified these
same species and others in additional study visits (Fig. S2). For
these subjects, we also compared the bacterial communities (ob-
tained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and reported in the work of
M. Loesche, S. E. Gardner, L. Kalan, J. Horwinski, Q. Zheng, B. P.
Hodkinson, A. S. Tyldsley, C. Franciscus, S. L. Hillis, S. Mehta,
D. J. Margolis, and E. Grice [submitted for publication]) and dis-
covered in some cases, such as subjects 194 and 198 (visit 0), that
fungal identification resulted in the absence of bacterial taxa in the
specimen. However, for the majority of wound specimens, mixed
fungal-bacterial communities were observed (see Fig. S2 and
Fig. S3A in the supplemental material).
The DFU mycobiome has high interpersonal and intraper-
sonal variation. A striking feature of DFU fungal community
structures was the absence of a core mycobiome or shared taxa
across the study cohort (Fig. 1A). We assessed the temporal sta-
bility of fungal communities over time by calculating the weighted
UniFrac distances (WUF) between study visits for a single subject.
We compared this to mean interpersonal WUF distances at their
baseline visit. Mean interpersonal WUF distances were signifi-
cantly greater than mean intrapersonal WUF distances (Fig. 1D),
suggesting that interpersonal variability is greater than intraper-
sonal variability. However, a high level of dissimilarity occurred in
both groups (mean of 0.71 versus 0.67, respectively; P � 0.0001 by
Wilcoxon rank sum test). At the taxonomic level, community
structure was ephemeral, with taxa sometimes appearing or dis-
appearing within one study visit (Fig. 2).
High rates of change between study visits suggest transient col-
onization or environmental contamination of the wound bed by
fungi. Contrary to this hypothesis is the standardized care em-
ployed in this study, where a total-contact cast (TCC) (n � 87) or
a DH boot (n � 13) was applied for offloading following wound
cleansing and dressing. TCC results in creation of an occlusive
environment for the entire foot, minimizing influence from the
external environment. We examined the mycobiome community
stability of ulcers offloaded with TCC and DH boot but did not
observe significant differences between the two offloading meth-
ods (data not shown).
The DFU mycobiome is associated with clinical outcomes.
We next determined whether the DFU mycobiome was associ-
ated with clinical outcomes. An ideal biomarker would differen-
tiate wound outcomes at the initial presentation of patients; there-
fore, we analyzed the mycobiomes of the baseline study visit (visit
0) with respect to outcomes, in addition to analyses incorporating
all longitudinal data. At the baseline study visit, Ascomycota were
present in significantly greater relative abundance in wounds that
healed in �8 weeks compared to those that healed in �4 weeks
(P � 0.017 by Tukey post-hoc analysis). This distribution was sig-
nificant only at the initial presentation and Ascomycota propor-
tions did not significantly differ between groups after the baseline
visit (Fig. 3A). Baseline specimens were taken at the initial clinical
presentation and before the wound was surgically debrided of
dead tissue and/or biofilms, but the specimens were obtained
from viable wound tissue, not necrotic tissue. This suggests that
the mycobiome at the presentation visit can be predictive of the
time to heal.
We also assessed the stability of the mycobiome and its associ-
ation with outcomes. Intervisit WUF was not associated with heal-
ing outcome; healed or unhealed wounds or wounds on feet that
were amputated later display high levels of change over time that
were not significantly influenced by a clinical complication or ad-
ministration of an antibiotic (Fig. 3B and C). Although the mean
WUF values were �0.5, indicating high rates of change, in some
cases, a trend was observed in subjects that ultimately required an
amputation, where the WUF values were lower, meaning myco-
biomes from sequential visits were less dissimilar. This suggests a
more stable colonization of the fungal community and potentially
implicates the formation of a biofilm or infection leading to sub-
sequent chronicity. This is exemplified in the bottom panel of
Fig. 2 (subject 198) where the first three study visits of this partic-
ular subject were dominated by Trichosporon asahii, followed by a
shift to a predominant population of Cladosporidium herbarum in
the later visits. Conversely, the bacterial community stability in
this subject is low during the first three visits until the fungal
community shifts, and stability for both groups then follows the
same general pattern. Similar trends are observed in other subjects
and indicate that the stability of the fungal community structure is
not independent of the cohabitating bacterial community stability
(see Fig. S3B in the supplemental material).
Antibiotics were administered to 31 of 100 subjects at some
point during the course of the study. We hypothesized that anti-
biotic treatment would influence the fungal portion of the micro-

 biome in response to observed bacterial perturbation and disrup-
tion (Loesche et al., submitted). In subjects that received
antibiotics, the Shannon diversity indices for all visits combined
were significantly higher than the indices for the subjects who did
not receive an antibiotic (P � 0.029 by Wilcoxon rank sum test).
However, diversity over time did not significantly fluctuate be-
fore, during, or after antibiotic administration. We also examined
the class of antibiotic administered and discovered it was nondis-
criminating in influencing the overall diversity metrics in these
subjects (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). In specimens
from study visits where a complication was observed, Shannon
diversity was also significantly higher (mean Shannon diversity
index of 0.98 versus 1.30; P � 0.001 by Wilcoxon rank sum test),
but visits with complications cooccurred with visits of antibiotic
administration only 45% of the time (41/91 total visits).
Pathogens versus allergens in the DFU mycobiome. We
elected to bin taxa into the “pathogens” or “allergens” category,
because with respect to skin and cutaneous infection, the majority
of taxa identified in our data set fell into one of these two groups of
either known/opportunistic skin pathogens or the filamentous
fungi often identified as allergenic molds (Fig. 4A). While some
members of the “allergens” group, such as Aspergillus spp., can
also be opportunistic pathogens, this is rare in the context of skin
and cutaneous infection so we limited their classification. We first
assessed associations between the list of allergen and pathogen
phylotypes and the taxa listed in Table 2 using Spearman rank
correlations. Taxon correlations were then subjected to hierarchi-
cal clustering via hclust. The allergens and pathogens clustered
separately, discriminated by their associations with six key taxa
(Aspergillus cibarius, Penicillium bialowiezense, Epicoccum nigrum,
Pencillium sp., Trichosporon asahii, and Candida albicans). Aller-
gens had positive associations with all six, whereas pathogens did
not exhibit any strong associations, positive or negative (see
Fig. S5 in the supplemental material).

DFUs that healed (subjects 145, 117, 159), that did not heal within the 26 weeks of the study (subject 186), or that resulted in an amputation (subject 198). The

 With respect to clinical outcomes, a trend emerged where the
mean proportions of pathogens were higher in nonhealing
wounds and those wounds that ultimately resulted in amputation,
compared to wounds that healed, though this trend was not sta-
tistically significant (Fig. 4B). The mean proportion of allergens
was unchanged across all outcome groups (data not shown).
We also examined mean relative abundance of allergens and
pathogens with respect to necrosis, because the level of necrotic
wound tissue may indicate wound health or deterioration.
Strikingly, in wounds with 75 to 100% necrotic tissue, the pro-
portion of allergens is reduced and a highly significant increase
in the proportions of pathogens is observed (P � 0.001 by
analysis of variance and Tukey post-hoc analysis) (Fig. 4C). To
better visualize this distribution across samples, we con-
structed an independently calculated weighted UniFrac dis-
tance ordination plot overlaid with the relative proportions of
allergens and pathogens and the level of necrotic tissue in each
sample. Clear separation is observed between the two groups,
and pathogens are predominantly found in those samples with
high levels of necrosis (Fig. 4D).
Since pathogens may directly contribute to wound necrosis
and negative outcomes, the most severe being amputation, we
further examined all possible associations between additional
clinical factors and the relative abundance of pathogens and
allergens and the two dominant taxa in each of those groups
(C. albicans and C. herbarum, respectively). By Spearman rank
correlation, allergens were negatively associated with HgbA1c
levels (rho � �0.308; P � 0.02) and WBC counts (rho �
�0.346; P � 0.009), suggesting that glucose control and lower
levels of inflammation are consistent with allergen coloniza-
tion (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Specifically,
C. herbarum was negatively associated with HgbA1c (rho �
�0.405; P � 0.002) but positively associated with the ulcer
surface area (rho � 0.348; P � 0.008) and days in the study
(rho � 0.279; P � 0.038) (Fig. S1). Because the culture-positive
samples coincided with wound deterioration and the mean
proportion of the group “pathogens” is elevated in nonhealing
wounds and necrosis, we looked for associations between both
Candida spp. and the pathogens group to clinical factors, but
no additional significant associations were identified (Fig. S1).

 The DFU mycobiome forms multispecies biofilms with bac-
teria. We hypothesized that biofilm formation occurred in those ul-
cers where a pathogenic fungal species was detected. Cultures were
obtained from samples collected from subjects 145 and 198, repre-
senting delayed (�6 weeks) but healed and amputated wounds, re-
spectively (Fig. 2). C. albicans was isolated from subject 145, and
T. asahii was isolated from subject 198. Samples from these subjects
also grew the bacterial isolates Citrobacter freundii (subject 145) and
Staphylococcus simulans (subject 198). The ability of each isolate to
form a biofilm as monoculture or coculture was assessed and con-
firmed visually by confocal microscopy. The yeast-bacterium pairs
(C. albicans plus C. freundii and T. asahii plus S. simulans) readily
grew as coculture on agar plates. Biofilm growth was observed for
monocultureofeachyeaststrainwithdistincthyphalgrowthofC.al-
bicans and chains or clumping of cells for T. asahii. The bacterial
strains were also able to grow as biofilms in monoculture, forming
distinct microcolonies although in a more dispersed and confluent
layer than the yeast monocultures (Fig. 5). Mixed-species biofilms
formed within 24 h and further matured over 48 h. The cocultures
revealedcloseinteractionsbetweenbacterialandyeastcells.Theyeast
cells appear to form the “core” of the colony, and bacteria associate
around the periphery of the cells, coating yeast cells and hyphae as
they grow out of the plate to a thickness of approximately 30 �m for
C. albicans plus C. freundii and a thickness of 15 �m for T. asahii and
S.simulansafter48h(Fig.5).Theseobservationscoupledwithquan-
titativecountsoftheplanktonicandbiofilmmono-orcocultures(see
Fig. S7 in the supplemental material) suggest that the yeast and bac-
terial species interact in a noncompetitive manner to form mixed
biofilms.
To assess fungal-bacterial interactions with a more global view,
we determined Spearman rank correlations between the fungal
and bacterial taxa found in �1% abundance in the entire data set.
Corynebacterium sp. in the order Actinomycetales was significantly
negatively correlated with C. albicans and Candida parapsilosis.
Members of the Actinomycetales are historically rich sources of
bioactive small molecules. On the other hand, C. albicans was
significantly positively correlated with the order Alcaligenaceae, a
group of Gram-negative Proteobacteria.

Mean proportion of pathogens, allergens, unclassified fungi, and unclassified Ascomycota in samples grouped by the level of necrotic tissue present in the wound.
The level of pathogens is significantly higher in ulcers with �75% necrotic tissue compared to all other levels of necrosis. P values are calculated with an analysis
of variance model and post-hoc Tukey HSD multiple comparison of means. (D) Principal-coordinate plot comparing samples by the weighted UniFrac distance.
Percent variation explained by each principal coordinate (PC) is indicated by the percentage next to each axis. Point size indicates necrotic tissue level, with larger
points corresponding to greater amounts of necrotic tissue in the wound from which the specimen was taken. The proportions of allergens and pathogens were
calculated by subtracting the proportion of pathogens from the proportion of allergens in each sample resulting in a scale of �1 (dominated by pathogens) to �1
(dominated by allergens). A value of zero indicates either zero or equal proportions of each.

 DISCUSSION
Chronic nonhealing wounds are host to polymicrobial communi-
ties that can form biofilms and interfere with healing processes.
Here we utilized high-throughput sequencing of the rRNA inter-
nal transcribed spacer ITS1 amplified from DFU specimens col-
lected longitudinally to demonstrate that DFUs contain a diverse
repertoire of fungi not recognized clinically or by traditional cul-
ture procedures. Our study is the first to identify fungi in a large
proportion (80%) of DFUs surveyed. The longitudinal aspect of
our study design and standardized care protocol establishes that
the mycobiome is highly dynamic and transient in DFUs, with
increased fungal diversity in subjects administered antibiotics or
experiencing a complication. While the subset of subjects on an-
tibiotics was not large enough to allow for detailed investigation
into the short- and long-term effects on the mycobiome, future
studies are warranted, incorporating both fungal and bacterial
community dynamics in response to antibiotic perturbation.
Studies of the mycobiome in chronic disease are not abundant.
It was striking to us that C. herbarum was the most abundant
species found in �1 specimen from 56% of our subjects. Although
this saprophytic dematiaceous fungus is widespread in the envi-
ronment, it has been reported as one of the most common fungal
species associated with the human body in different body sites,
including the oral, nasal, vaginal, and gut mycobiomes (31, 34,
48–50). Not only are Cladosporium spp. sensitizing agents leading
to allergic rhinitis, but they are also linked to other human dis-
eases, including an outbreak of fungal meningitis in 2012 (51),
and recently, Cladosporium spp. were identified in 92 clinical spec-
imens with 28% of those coming from superficial and deep tissues
(52). Together, these data indicate that Cladosporium spp. should
be regarded as a member of the human mycobiome.
C. albicans was the second most abundant phylotype identi-
fied, present in 47 subjects and 21% of samples. Other Candida
species identified were C. parasilopsis (15%), C. tropicalis (9.76%),
C. glabrata (3.7%), and C. smithsonii (2.9%), while C. boleticola,
C. dubliniensis, C. orthopsilosis, C. metapsilosis, and C. xylopsoci
were found in less than 3% of the samples. Candida abundance
can fluctuate during gut microbiome dysbiosis, for instance by
antibiotic administration early in life, and has been associated
with asthma and allergic airway response to fungal allergens (53–
55). Specifically, overgrowth of C. albicans in the gut microbiome
of mice can provoke sensitization resulting in a CD4�-T-cell-
mediated response to mold spores that is not observed in mice
without microbiota disruption (56). It is not clear whether similar
responses occur in other tissues and body sites or whether this
response is isolated to the gut-airway axis. The DFU mycobiome is
primarily composed of a balance of commensal and pathogenic
yeasts (Candida spp., Trichosporon spp.) and a heterogeneous
population of anamorphic fungi recognized as important causes
of respiratory allergies (57). Instability in communities both be-
tween and within individuals suggests transient or superficial col-
onization of the DFUs by spores, highlighting an important limi-
tation to sequence-based studies—the inability to determine
active metabolism. In this context, however, it is tempting to
imagine a scenario by which exposure to fungal spores and their
antigens is sufficient to provoke an immunological response that
contributes to prolonged inflammation and stalled healing.
Poor perfusion is a hallmark of DFUs and can contribute to
impaired healing. Increased fungal diversity in DFUs with re-
duced oxygenation is consistent with our finding that biofilm-
forming yeasts and opportunistic skin commensal pathogens were
highly significantly and strongly associated with wound necrosis
and poor outcomes. This association was not driven by a single
species but a mixed group of pathogens.
This study provides the foundation for further dissection of
microbial interactions and their profound influence on disease

 progression. Here, we demonstrate the ability of yeast-bacterial
pairs isolated from DFUs to form mixed biofilms. Two yeast-
bacterial pairs were cultured from DFUs identified as having a
stable community by our molecular analysis and used to validate
fungal-bacterial biofilm formation. To our knowledge, there is
little information regarding interactions between C. albicans and
C. freundii or T. asahii and S. simulans. The results of our in silico
analysis also suggest that an antagonistic interaction is occurring
between Candida and Corynebacterium species. Continued explo-
ration to determine the magnitude and mechanisms of micro-
biome interactions in contributing to impaired healing and skin
and soft-tissue infection is an important and timely area of re-
search. Observation of diverse fungal communities in chronic
nonhealing wounds and their ability to form interkingdom bio-
films with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial spe-
cies emphasizes the paramount importance but also the complex-
ity of studying whole microbial communities, their interspecies
interactions, and implications for chronic disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design. From September 2008 through October 2012, 100 subjects
were enrolled in a prospective cohort to sample the DFU microbiota and
measure outcomes. Subjects were recruited through local-media adver-
tisements and from outpatient clinics at the University of Iowa Hospitals
and Clinics (UIHC) and the Iowa City Veteran’s Affairs Medical Center
(VA). Samples for microbiota analyses were collected at the initial presen-
tation (visit 0 [V0]) and every 2 weeks until the following: (i) the DFU
healed, (ii) the foot was amputated, or (iii) 26 weeks of follow-up elapsed
(visit 1 [V1] to V12). The Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at the Uni-
versity of Iowa (IRB number 200706724) and the University of Pennsyl-
vania approved the study procedures (IRB number 815195). Informed
consent was obtained from all participants in writing.
Wound management was standardized to aggressive sharp debride-
ment of necrotic tissue in the wound bed at baseline and wound edge
callus removal every 2 weeks followed by nonantimicrobial dressing ap-
plication (i.e., Lyofoam; Molnlycke Health Care). Ulcers were offloaded
with total-contact casts (87 subjects) or DH boots (13 subjects). Topical
antimicrobial or system antibiotic administration was not included unless
an infection-related complication was present at the beginning of the
study (baseline) or occurred within the study period. Data were collected
at baseline and longitudinally every 2 weeks until the wound healed or
26 weeks had elapsed.
Study variables. (i) Clinical factors. Demographic variables were col-
lected at the initial or baseline visit, including age, sex, diabetes type and
duration, and duration of the study ulcer using subject self-report and
medical records. At each study visit, glycemic control was measured by the
levels of hemoglobin A1c and blood glucose. Inflammatory (erythrocyte
sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein) and immune (white
blood cell counts) markers were determined with standard laboratory
tests. Each subject was also assessed for ischemia using the ankle-brachial
and toe-brachial index and for neuropathy using the 5.07 Semmes-
Weinstein monofilament test. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure was mea-
sured at baseline and at each follow-up visit, using a transcutaneous oxy-
gen monitor (Novametrix840; Novametrix Medical Systems Inc.). Ulcer
location was categorized as forefoot, midfoot, or hind foot. The level of
necrotic tissue was defined as black, gray, or yellow tissue in the wound
bed measured using a Likert scale as the percentage of the total wound area
binned according to 0 to 25%, 25 to 50%, 50 to 75%, or 75 to 100%
necrotic tissue.
(ii) Outcomes. Healing and infection-related complications were as-
sessed every 2 weeks. Ulcer closure was determined using the Wound
Healing Society’s definition of “an acceptably healed wound,” a valid and
reliable definition (58). “Development of infection-related complica-
tions” was defined as wound deterioration, new osteomyelitis, and/or
amputations due to DFU infections.
Wound deterioration was defined as the development of frank ery-
thema and heat and an increase in size of �50% over baseline. Two mem-
bers of the research team independently assessed each DFU for erythema
and heat. Two members of the research team independently assessed size
using the VeVMD digital software system (Vista Medical, Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Canada) and procedures previously described (59). A cotton-
tipped swab, placed in the deepest aspect of the DFU, was marked where
the swab intersected with the plane of the periwound skin. The distance
between the tip of the swab and the mark was measured as ulcer depth
using a centimeter ruler.
Osteomyelitis was assessed using radiographs and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) at baseline and during follow-up visits when subjects pre-
sented with new tracts to bone, wound deterioration, elevated tempera-
ture, elevated white blood cell count, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation
rate, or elevated C-reactive protein. If these indicators were absent at
follow-up, radiographs were not retaken. Subjects experiencing new am-
putations had their medical records reviewed by the research team to
ensure that amputations were due to DFU infection and not some other
reason.
(iii) Sequencing of fungal ITS1 rRNA region. Ulcer specimens were
collected using the Levine technique and established protocols (30). DNA
was isolated from swab specimens as previously described (21). The ITS1F
(F stands for forward) (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2R
(R stands for reverse) (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) primers were
used for PCR amplification, each having a linker sequence, a sample-
specific GoLay12 index, and an Illumina adapter to amplify the ITS1 re-
gion of the fungal rRNA region. These indexed primers were used in
combinations that made it possible to multiplex up to 576 (24 � 24)
samples at a time. Each sample (along with one mock community, three
buffer controls, and two water controls) was amplified in duplicate, com-
bined, and cleaned using the Agencourt AMPure XP bead-based PCR
purification system (Beckman Coulter). PCR mixtures contained 9.65 �l
PCR-clean water, 1.25 �l 10� Accuprime buffer II (Invitrogen), 0.1 �l
Accuprime high-fidelity Taq (Invitrogen), 0.25 �l each of the forward and
reverse primers (at 10 �M concentration), and 1.0 �l genomic DNA.
Reaction mixtures were held at 94°C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with
amplification proceeding for 35 cycles, with 1 cycle consisting of 94°C for
45 s, 56°C for 60 s, and 72°C for 90 s; a final extension of 10 min at 72°C
was performed. Purified amplicon pools were quantified using the
Quant-IT double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) high-sensitivity assay kit (In-
vitrogen) and a microplate reader (ThermoFisher Scientific). A composite
sample for sequencing was made by combining equimolar ratios of am-
plicons from the samples, followed by gel purification with a Qiagen Min-
Elute gel extraction kit to remove potential contaminants and PCR arti-
facts (the acceptable size window for amplicons was 200 to 1,000 bp in
length). The pooled DNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Life
Technologies), and �X174 genomic DNA was spiked into the sample at
~40% prior to sequencing. MiSeq 300- bp paired-end “V3” sequencing
was performed. Additional negative controls were processed as described
above, except the ITS1F and ITS2R primers were used without bar-coded
adapters and amplicons were sequenced by standard Sanger sequencing.
The MiSeq ITS libraries were preprocessed using an in-house pipeline
that includes read quality control (QC), barcode demultiplexing, paired-
end assembly, and linker cleaning steps. The pipeline procedures are
briefly explained below.
1. Read QC. Raw read quality was checked for the average and range of
the Phred quality scores along the reads (1 to 300 bp) for both forward and
reverse reads independently.
2. Read demultiplexing. Our MiSeq ITS library construction protocol
utilizes a customized barcode system with both forward and reverse bar
codes embedded near the 5= termini of both reads; thus, the forward and
reverse bar codes are first spliced and concatenated from the correspond-

 ing reads, and then read pairs are demultiplexed using the Flexbar pro-
gram (v2.4) (60) with default settings.
3. Paired-end assembly. Demultiplexed paired-end reads are assem-
bled (merged) using the PEAR (v0.9.0) program (61) with default settings.
4. Bar code/linker cleaning. Our customized bar code/primer system
incorporates a linker region between the actual bar codes and PCR prim-
ers to increase the heterogeneity of the amplicons for successful Illumina
sequencing. These in-line bar code and linker sequences are cleaned from
final assembled amplicons by in-house Perl scripts, in a way that is based
only on the length of the bar codes/linkers, which guarantees a successful
removal.
The PIPITS pipeline was used for ITS1 processing (45). Briefly, the
ITS1 region was extracted with ITSx (46), clustered into operational tax-
onomic units (OTUs) with VSEARCH (https://github.com/torognes/
vsearch) at 97% sequence similarity and chimera removal performed us-
ing the UNITE UCHIME reference data set. Representative sequences
were assigned taxonomic classification with the RDP classifier against the
UNITE fungal ITS reference data set (62) at a confidence threshold of
0.85. Contaminants found in negative controls (corresponding to the
taxon Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Alternaria eichornia) were removed at
the OTU level (4 OTUs removed) followed by subsampling 500 sequences
per sample. The Shannon diversity index, Simpson diversity index (1-
Dominance), Faith’s phylogenetic distance (PD), and number of ob-
served species (richness) were calculated using the QIIME 1.8.0 alpha_di-
versity.py script (63). Beta-diversity metrics were calculated with the
QIIME 1.8.0 beta_diversity.py script.
Fungal and bacterial manipulation. (i) Isolation. Yeast and bacterial
isolates were grown from wound swabs collected in Trypticase soy broth
(TSB). Briefly, 100 �l of TSB containing the swab was plated onto yeast-
mold agar (YM agar; Neogen, Lansing, MI) and incubated at 25°C for up
to 7 days. Individual colonies were picked and grown on YM or TSB agar
plates to be made into glycerol stocks for long-term storage. All strains
isolated were identified by amplification of the ITS1 region (primers de-
scribed above without adapters) or 16S rRNA gene (16S 27’F and 534’R)
and Sanger sequencing. Secondary confirmation was obtained by matrix-
assisted laser desorption ionization�time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass
spectrometry at the Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System.
The yeast isolate grown from subject 198 was identified as Tricho-
sporon asahii by Sanger sequencing and a BLAST search against the NCBI
nucleotide (nt) database and UNITE database. The sequence was com-
pared to the OTU identified as Trichosporon ovoides as part of the PIPITS
pipeline and found to have 100% identity, so the OTU was reclassified as
T. asahii.
(ii) Biofilm growth. Isolates were grown overnight at 37°C on YM agar
(fungi) or Trypticase soy agar (TSA) (bacteria). Colonies were scraped
into 0.89% NaCl and diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of
0.08 to 0.1 with the exception of T. asahii (OD600 of 0.17 to 0.2). Bacterial
suspensions were diluted 1/10 into RPMI 1640 medium with GlutaMAX
supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The inoculums
were then added in a 1/10 dilution to a final volume of 4 ml RPMI 1640
medium in 35-mm polystyrene plates. Cultures were incubated stationary
at 37°C for 24 or 48 h to allow adhesion and growth. The medium was
removed, and the biofilms were washed twice with 1 ml of sterile 0.89%
NaCl to remove nonadherent cells. The biofilms were stained with the
LIVE BacLight bacterial Gram stain kit (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) with SYTO 9 (480 nm/500 nm) and hexidium iodide
(480 nm/625 nm) as a 2-ml solution in water and according to the kit
instructions. The stain was removed, and deionized water was added to
the biofilms prior to imaging on a Leica TCS SP5 microscope with 20�
objective. Images were postprocessed with Volocity software (PerkinEl-
mer, Waltham, MA). The maximum projection for each image was used
to generate Fig. 5.
Quantitative counts of mono- and cocultures were performed by serial
dilution of planktonic cells (media), wash media (washed twice with
1 ml), and 0.89% saline containing adherent cells that were scraped and
resuspended (n � 2). The dilutions were plated onto nonselective media
(YM or TSA) and incubated for 16 to 18 h at 37°C. Colonies were counted,
and the total CFU were calculated.
Data analyses. The R statistical package (64) was used for all compu-
tations unless described elsewhere. The classification of “pathogens” or
“allergens” was performed manually based on classification in literature.
Statistical methods are described in the text and figure legends. Correla-
tions between microbiome and clinical features were determined by cal-
culating the Spearman coefficient.
