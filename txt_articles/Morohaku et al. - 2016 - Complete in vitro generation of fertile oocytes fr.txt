Reconstituting gametogenesis in vitro is a key goal for reproductive
biology and regenerative medicine. Successful in vitro reconstitution
of primordial germ cells and spermatogenesis has recently had a
significant effect in the field. However, recapitulation of oogenesis
in vitro remains unachieved. Here we demonstrate the first re-
constitution, to our knowledge, of the entire process of mammalian
oogenesis in vitro from primordial germ cells, using an estrogen-
receptor antagonist that promotes normal follicle formation, which
in turn is crucial for supporting oocyte growth. The fundamental
events in oogenesis (i.e., meiosis, oocyte growth, and genomic
imprinting) were reproduced in the culture system. The most
rigorous evidence of the recapitulation of oogenesis was the birth
of fertile offspring, with a maximum of seven pups obtained from a
cultured gonad. Moreover, cryopreserved gonads yielded functional
oocytes and offspring in this culture system. Thus, our in vitro
system will enable both innovative approaches for a deeper under-
standing of oogenesis and a new avenue to create and preserve
female germ cells.
oogenesis | primordial germ cells | follicle formation | oocytes | in vitro
O
ocytes contain fundamental materials for perpetuating a spe-
cies; that is, the maternal genome and ooplasm filled with
maternal factors that are essential for totipotency, including mito-
chondria, which are transmitted to the next generation. Therefore,
the process of oogenesis is of wide interest in reproductive biology
and regenerative medicine. However, mechanisms underlying the
process are not fully elucidated. An approach to comprehensively
resolve the mechanisms of oogenesis is to reconstitute the entire
process of oogenesis in vitro (1, 2).
In mice, primordial germ cells (PGCs) mitotically divide until
13.5 d postcoitum (dpc) in the fetal gonads, after which they imme-
diately enter meiosis. Passage through prophase of the first meiotic
division and preparation for primordial follicle formation, including
the breakdown of oocyte cysts, occurs during the remainder of the
prenatal period. Shortly after birth, a cohort of primordial follicles
enters the growth phase, and after 3 wk, oocyte growth culminates in
the acquisition of competencies to resume meiosis, complete mater-
nal imprinting, undergo fertilization, and support full-term develop-
ment. Applications of in vitro systems to study the events involved in
oogenesis have been widely used, although none has been successful
in reconstituting the entire process. To date, most successful recon-
stitutions of oogenesis (but not from the onset) with proven fertility
have used neonatal oocytes, which were already in the prophase of
the first meiosis and were ready to be assembled into primordial
follicles (3–6).
Thus far, the ectopic oogenesis from PGCs to fertile mature
oocytes has been achieved only by means of grafting PGCs into
other mice to facilitate key steps (7, 8). Even PGC-like cells,
originally produced from mouse embryonic stem and induced
pluripotent stem cells, can develop into functional oocytes after
reaggregation with gonadal somatic cells and grafting beneath
the bursa (9, 10). However, many previous studies attempting in
vitro oogenesis without the help of grafting have documented the
occurrence of aberrant follicular formation and insufficient growth
and ability of the oocytes after in vitro growth (IVG) (1, 2, 11).
Thus, the crucial step remaining to create a connected “chain” of
in vitro oogenesis is to eliminate the gap between what can be
achieved using grafting and what has become possible by culture
(i.e., IVG of oocytes from the primordial follicle stage) (3–5).
Three events need to be achieved to successfully reconstitute
oogenesis in vitro: the initial phase of meiosis, follicular assembly,
and appropriate conditions to support sufficient oocyte growth and
complete maturation. Elucidating the mechanisms of oogenesis is
important, and if the above three requirements are fulfilled, then
in vitro oogenesis can enable mass generation of oocytes.
In this study, we reconstituted the entire process of oogenesis
across meiosis and complete maturation in vitro. Meiosis, follic-
ular formation, oocyte growth, and maternal imprinting, all of
which are required for the development of a functional oocyte,
were found to be accomplished without apparent abnormality.
Results
Meiotic Entry and Follicular Assembly in Vitro. In our initial experi-
ments, female gonads obtained at 12.5 dpc were cultured on
Transwell-COL membranes, using the α-MEM supplemented with
10% (vol/vol) FBS, as previously described (3, 11). On the basis of
the meiotic marker synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3)
(12), entry into meiosis occurred during the first 5 d of culture,
irrespective of the absence of the mesonephros (Fig. S1A), which
contrasts with previous data that suggested the involvement of
mesonephroi in the entry into meiosis (13). On day 17 of culture,
corresponding to an age of 10 d in vivo (Fig. 1A), the ovary
Significance
Throughout the life of female mammals, only a small number of
viable oocytes are produced. The mechanisms underlying the
creation and selection of competent oocytes remain unclear.
Here, we propose a novel approach for elucidating these un-
solved questions, involving the use of an in vitro system estab-
lished in the present study, which can fully reproduce mammalian
oogenesis from mouse fetal primordial germ cells. Reconstitution
of the entire oogenesis process has not been previously accom-
plished. Our system will assist in understanding the mechanisms
of oogenesis and also create a new gamete resource in mammals.

 contained many growing oocytes; however, most were contained in
hypoplastic follicles with abnormal and unclear external layers (Fig.
S1 B and D). The oocytes in these follicles were easily denuded
during follicle isolation attempts and were no longer capable of
growth in culture, thereby indicating severe defects in follicular as-
sembly. Despite the presence of >100 growing oocytes per ovary,
only four to six secondary follicles were successfully isolated (Fig. 1 B
and E), which is consistent with previous studies (1, 11). An analysis
of laminin-immunostained images (14) of the follicle basement
membrane indicated that the hypoplastic follicles had incomplete
laminin envelopes, unlike normal in vivo follicles, which develop a
complete envelope (Fig. S1B). Some neighboring in vitro follicles
shared the same theca or granulosa cell layer, and multioocyte fol-
licles were occasionally detected (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1B, and Movie S1).
Cause of Hypoplastic Follicle Formation in Vitro. We hypothesized that
this abnormally structured secondary follicle has its root in the early
stage of primordial follicle assembly; if so, this could be caused by a
mechanism that involves estrogen and governs the oocyte cyst
breakdown and primordial follicular formation (15, 16).
To explore the cause of an abnormal follicular state and test this
hypothesis, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed
using ovaries cultured in α-MEM + FBS on day 7 and ovaries
from mice at 0 d postpartum (dpp) (Fig. S1E). In the RNA-seq
analysis, the global gene expression pattern that was observed for
in vitro-derived ovaries was highly correlated (R = 0.992) (Fig.
S2A) with that of neonatal ovaries, indicating that developmental
progression in culture was similar to development in vivo. How-
ever, 547 genes were differentially expressed between the in vitro-
cultured ovaries and neonatal ovaries (normalized signal value,
>5; P < 0.05; greater than threefold change) (Table S1). Ingenuity
pathway analysis clearly demonstrated that β-estradiol, trans-acting
transcription factor 1 (SP1), and β-catenin (CTNNB1), which bind
to estrogen receptors and regulate gene expression (17), consti-
tuted the top three predicted upstream regulators of the 547 genes
(Fig. 1C and Table S2). These results indicated that an elevated

 estrogen signaling level, probably triggered by some ligands in
FBS, caused hypoplastic follicle formation in vitro.
Overcoming Hypoplastic Follicle Formation in Vitro. The potential
effects of FBS-derived estrogen in the culture medium were mini-
mized as follows (Fig. S1E): A serum protein substitute (SPS;
44 mg/mL normal human serum albumin and 6 mg/mL α- and
β-globulins in PBS) was used instead of FBS (α-MEM + SPS);
α-MEM + SPS was used only from day 5 to day 11, when oocyte cyst
breakdown and primordial follicle assembly occurs (6) (α-MEM +
FBS/SPS); and an estrogen-receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780; ICI)
was added from day 5 to day 11 (α-MEM + FBS/ICI). These test
conditions significantly improved the efficiency of the isolation of
single secondary follicles, each of which encapsulated a single primary
oocyte (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1 C and D). In particular, the addition of
ICI resulted in a more than sevenfold increase in the number of
single secondary follicles compared with the original conditions (Fig.
1E) (P < 1 × 10−3). Furthermore, ICI treatment promoted the for-
mation of a complete laminin envelope by individual follicles (Fig.
S1C). Although oocytes in the secondary follicles that were cultured
in vitro were smaller than those growing in vivo, the ratios of oocyte/
follicle diameters were comparable (Fig. 1F), suggesting the follicles
assembled normally in vitro. On the basis of an RNA-seq analysis of
ovaries that were cultured for 7 d in α-MEM + FBS/10 μM ICI, 421
genes were differentially expressed between ovaries cultured with
α-MEM + FBS/ICI and neonatal ovaries (Table S3), although the
global pattern of gene expression was highly correlated with that of
neonatal ovaries (Fig. S2A). Ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated
that β-estradiol and SP1 were not on the top 10 list of predicted up-
stream regulators of the 421 genes (Fig. S2B and Table S4). Potential
downstream target genes responsible for hypoplastic follicle forma-
tion were identified among 213 genes whose transcript levels differed
specifically in α-MEM + FBS-cultured ovaries (Fig. S2C). Finally,
supplementing the culture medium with estradiol impaired follicle
formation; therefore, the efficiency of secondary follicle isolation was
reduced (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1D). Collectively, this series of analyses
clearly demonstrated that the appropriate regulation of estrogen
binding to its receptors is crucial for initial in vitro folliculogenesis.
Oocyte and Follicular Growth in Vitro. Secondary follicles were isolated
on day 17 of culture because a prolonged culture of whole ovaries
eventually results in large-scale follicular degeneration (Fig. S3A).
The isolated follicles were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with
5% (vol/vol) FBS, 2% (wt/vol) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; 360 kDa)
(18), and 0.1 IU/mL follicle-stimulating hormone for IVG. The PVP-
supplemented medium was used because of its effect on maintaining
the integrity of oocyte–granulosa cell complexes in a long-term cul-
ture, which was found in our previous study in cattle (19). We
demonstrated here that without PVP supplementation, even in the
early phase of IVG (day 20), the ratio of follicle/oocyte diameters was
significantly smaller than that cultured in medium supplemented with
2% (wt/vol) PVP (1.82 vs. 1.95; P = 0.0049) (Fig. S3B). Moreover, the

 follicle growth (20), were slightly reduced in follicles cultured in the
PVP-free medium (Fig. S3C). After a full term of IVG, a significantly
larger proportion of oocyte–granulosa cell complexes were recovered
from the medium with PVP than from the medium without PVP
supplementation (Fig. S3 D and E) (with PVP: 344/519; without PVP:
98/524; P = 0.00488).
Previous reports have described two possible IVG culture
methods, wherein the intact follicle structure (i.e., oocytes, gran-
ulosa cells, the basal lamina, and thecal layers) is maintained or the
oocyte–granulosa cell complex is directly exposed to the medium.
The latter method requires collagenase treatment for digestion of
the outer layer of follicles. In preliminary experiments in which IVG
was conducted without collagenase treatment, 83% of isolated
follicles survived (116/140). However, only a few oocytes reached
metaphase during the second meiosis [MII; 26/116; MII oocytes/
cumulus cells-oocyte complexes (COCs)], supposedly because of the
insufficient growth of oocytes/follicles, none of which were normally
fertilized. Therefore, we treated the follicles with 0.1% collagenase
for at least 15 min and largely removed the thecal layers by pipetting
on day 20 of culture. During IVG culture with collagenase treat-
ment, granulosa cell proliferation, oocytes, and clearly outlined
germinal vesicles (GV) with a characteristic nucleolus were ob-
served in most of the follicular structures (Fig. 2A and Table 1).
Mural granulosa cells often formed dorm-like structures. Immu-
nostaining of hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and
steroid delta-isomerase (HSD3B), which is essential for progester-
one production (21, 22), showed the presence of a population of
steroidogenic cells on day 26 of culture (Fig. S3F). Continuous in-
creases in the progesterone and estradiol concentrations in the
medium suggested persistent steroidogenic activity in the follicles
(Fig. 2B). Steroidogenic markers, such as Hsd3b1, cytochrome
P450, family 17, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp17a1) and Cyp19a1
mRNA, were also expressed in the follicles on day 26 of culture
(Fig. S3G). On days 29–33, COCs were collected from approxi-
mately half of the cultured follicles (Table 1). During the IVG
culture, the oocytes increased in size to a mean diameter of 80.0 μm
(n = 85) (Fig. 2C). Because the average diameter before IVG was
54.4 μm (n = 203) (Figs. 1F and 2C), the oocyte volume increased
by 3.18-fold. A control experiment showed that the average diameter
of fully grown oocytes collected from superovulated mice was
89.9 μm (n = 74) (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the volume increased
by 3.98-fold in vivo compared with oocytes in secondary follicles of
10-dpp ovaries, whose average diameter was 56.6 μm (n = 175).
Although the size and growth rate of oocytes were slightly atten-
uated in the in vitro culture, oocyte-specific methylation imprints,
which are necessary for mammalian ontogeny (23), were never-
theless established in the oocytes grown in vitro (Fig. 2D).
Evidence for Recapitulation of Oogenesis in Vitro. The most rigorous
evidence for recapitulation of oogenesis in vitro originates from the
demonstration of the reproductive ability of oocytes. To evaluate
this, the oocytes grown in this system were subjected to in vitro
maturation, followed by in vitro fertilization. The collected COCs
were induced to resume meiosis, using gonadotropins and epidermal
growth factor (24). The majority of oocytes released the first polar
body after 17 h and became MII oocytes, as confirmed by a karyo-
type analysis (Fig. 3A). Approximately half (39–58%) of the MII
oocytes were normally fertilized (Fig. 3A and Table 1), and 83–97%
of the eggs developed to the two-cell stage on the next day and were
transferred into 0.5-dpc pseudopregnant ICR albino mice (Fig. 3A).
These transplantation experiments resulted in the birth of healthy
pups with comparable body weights to those derived from oocytes
in vivo (Fig. 3 B and C and Table 1). All the pups had pigmented
eyes, and hence were considered to have clearly originated from
in vitro-derived oocytes. The frequency of development from two-
cell-stage embryos to pups was 14–40% (Table 1). A maximum of
seven pups was obtained from a single gonad (Table S5), which is
comparable with the number seen by natural delivery in mice. On
average, 0.7–3.3 pups were obtained from each gonad, and they
showed normal appearance and fertility (Fig. S4).
Cryopreservation of Ovary: Approach to Applicable System. Cryopres-
ervation of ovarian tissue is an essential technology for preserving
animal fertility and gamete resources. Accordingly, the use of our
in vitro system to produce functional oocytes from cryopreserved
tissues is an important criterion to evaluate the application of the
culture system. We dissected each of the fetal gonads into two or
three sections, after which they were cryopreserved by vitrification
(25). After placing the gonads in liquid nitrogen for at least 3 d, the
gonads were rewarmed and cultured under the same conditions
(α-MEM + FBS/1 μM ICI) that were used for fresh gonads. Al-
though a decreased number of follicles formed in the thawed go-
nads, apparently normal offspring were nevertheless derived from
the resultant oocytes (Table 1). These results demonstrated the
feasibility of cryopreserving gonads and subsequent functional oocyte
production that are expected to serve as an alternative source of
oocytes in the future.
Discussion
Here, we demonstrated the first completely connected chain
of in vitro oogenesis that permits full differentiation of PGCs into
mature mouse oocytes. Breaks in the developmental “chain” have
been bypassed previously through in vivo conditions by grafting PGCs
beneath the renal capsules (7, 8) or the ovarian bursa (9). We used a
different kind of bypass, involving whole cytoplasm prepared from
in vivo-grown oocytes, which was combined with genomic materials
from in vitro-grown oocytes cultured from PGCs, using the nuclear
transfer technique (11, 26). All such bypasses demand additional
animals and complex procedures. More important, the existence of a
period during which oocytes are not observable and controllable
diminishes the potential of the experimental scheme involving oocyte
culture as the model of oogenesis. Thus, the use of our in vitro system
without breaking the “chain” can add convenience in conducting
experiments and open up new possibilities, such as enabling obser-
vation and manipulation throughout the course of oogenesis.
A crucial factor underlying the successful establishment of our
in vitro system stemmed from an observation of hypoplastic follicle
formation in the ovaries cultured in α-MEM + FBS (Fig. 1B). The

 addition of FBS caused a delay or failure of oocyte cyst breakdown
in the ovary, as suggested by the typical occurrence of multioocyte
follicle-like structures. Recently, follicular assembly in newborn
mouse ovaries was shown to be correlated with the loss of maternally,
fetal, and/or ovary-derived estrogen (27, 28). A markedly reduced
concentration of estrogen and/or progesterone is essential to promote
oocyte cyst breakdown and follicle formation in mice and rats (15,
29). This mechanism was apparently dominant in the case of ovaries
cultured in the present study, despite the absence of maternal and
fetal estrogen after 5 d in culture. FBS used in the medium is most
likely the primary candidate of the source of estrogen. This as-
sumption is consistent with the finding that no apparent inhibition of
follicle assembly was observed when SPS was used in place of FBS.
Moreover, the positive effect of the use of SPS disappeared on the
addition of estradiol (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). However, further study is
necessary to determine whether the cultured fetal ovary itself can
generate estrogen; for example, in response to the absence of ma-
ternally derived estrogen. In fact, Fortune and Eppig have shown that
neonatal ovaries can produce small amounts of estrogen (30).
It is of special importance that ovaries cultured in α-MEM + FBS
showed differential expression of genes regulated by estrogen (Fig.
1C and Table S1). Estrogen receptors comprise estrogen receptor 1
(alpha) (ESR1), estrogen receptor 2 (beta) (ESR2), and G protein-
coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) (17). It is well known that
ESRs are activated by estrogen binding to consensus DNA se-
quences and that they regulate the expression of various genes (17).
ICI, an antagonist of ESR1 and ESR2, caused dramatic changes of
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which include genes re-
sponsible for hypoplastic follicle formation (Fig. S2). These previous
findings and our current results strongly suggest the involvement of
induced ectopic activation of estrogen receptors in hypoplastic fol-
licle formation after the addition of FBS. Therefore, it is a rea-
sonable conclusion that the cyst breakdown problem was avoided by
the addition of ICI.
There are differences among mammalian species regarding the
course of follicle formation. For example, the number of primordial
follicles reaches a maximum value in the ovaries of 141- to 210-d-
old bovine fetuses, when the secretion of estradiol from the ovaries
is almost undetectable (31). In contrast, estradiol promotes pri-
mordial follicle formation in nonhuman primates (baboons) and
hamsters (32, 33), but not by an excess of estradiol (33). The reason
for such differences among species should be clarified to make our
in vitro system applicable in practice to animals other than mice.
Normal follicle formation is important for oocyte production in
vitro as well as in vivo (34, 35). However, an additional and perhaps
more dominant reason existed in the present study: normal robust
follicles that developed after ICI treatment showed the maximum
number of isolated secondary follicles from cultured ovaries. A more
than sevenfold increase in the efficiency of follicle recovery after ICI
exposure demonstrated a tremendous effect on the design and scale
of experiments for the latter part of oogenesis in vitro.
Although a key to success in the present study was the ability to
generate an increased yield of intact follicles until day 17, collage-
nase treatment of the isolated follicles also played an important role
in acquiring oocyte competency. The developmental competence of
oocytes was elicited by the collagenase treatment, which disrupts
integral follicle structure and may promote oocyte development by
supporting the direct transfer of materials to the exposed oocyte–
granulosa cell complexes. In contrast, potentially because of the
removal of a proportion of theca cells by collagenase, there was a
delay in the marked acceleration of steroidogenesis until day 25 of
culture (Fig. 2B).
Another modification of the culture medium was the supple-
mentation of PVP, which increased the recovery rate of bovine
oocyte-granulosa cell complexes after 2 wk of IVG (18, 19). In ad-
dition to its remarkable effect on maintaining the oocyte–granulosa
cell complexes in an integrated form and attached to the insert
membrane (Fig. S3D), PVP may positively affect the expression of
genes involved in granulosa cell proliferation, such as Bmp6, Bmp15,
Kit, and Kitl (Fig. S3C). It is also of interest that BMP6, a paracrine
and autocrine factor expressed in granulosa cells and oocytes, can
modulate steroidogenesis and follicle development (20).
Our in vitro system will be useful as a model for visualizing and
manipulating PGCs/oocytes throughout oogenesis and promoting
the development of functionally mature oocytes. In a recent study
by Pfender et al. (36), IVG of mouse oocytes from secondary fol-
licles was combined with a live-cell imaging, using RNA interfer-
ence screening to identify genes essential for meiosis. Our in vitro
oocyte production system expands the applications of such ap-
proaches to as early as the PGC stage and is especially effective for

Developmental competence of oocytes produced from PGCs in vitro. (A) Maturation, resumption of meiosis, fertilization, and embryonic development in vitro.
Shown are COCs obtained from follicles on day 29 after the beginning of organ culture (Upper Left); denuded fully grown oocytes at the GV stage after follicular
culture (Upper Middle Left); the karyotype of in vitro-derived oocytes at the first (Upper Middle Right) and second (Upper Right) meiotic stage with the number of
chiasmata and 20 pairs of homologous chromosomes, respectively; cumulus cell-enclosed in vitro-derived oocytes at the MII stage (Lower Left); normally fertilized eggs
with two pronuclei and the second polar body (Lower Middle Left), indicating the completion of meiosis after fertilization; and two-cell (Lower Middle Right) and
blastocyst-stage (Lower Middle Right) embryos. (Scale bars, 100 μm.) (B) Pups from in vitro-derived oocytes. (C) Birth weights of the offspring. White and black bars
indicate the mean body weights of offspring (1.53 ± 0.282 g vs. 1.63 ± 0.128 g) from in vitro-derived oocytes (n = 68) and in vivo-derived oocytes (n = 23), respectively.
Error bars indicate SD. No significant difference in body weights between the groups was observed (t test).

DEVELOPMENTAL
BIOLOGY
 elucidating mechanisms regulating the early stage of meiosis. The
same system is also applicable to PGC-like cells derived from em-
bryonic stem and induced pluripotent stem cells (9, 10). Our system
will assist in bridging the current technical gaps in the entire in vitro
oocyte production process from stem cells.
Spermatogenesis has been recently reconstituted in an organ cul-
ture of neonatal testicular tissue (37). Thus, complete reconstitution
of gametogenesis is now possible in both males and females.
Materials and Methods
Expanded methods are available in SI Materials and Methods. All the animals
were purchased from CLEA Japan. BDF1 mouse fetuses were collected from
C57BL/6N female mice crossed with DBA/2J male mice at 12.5 dpc and were
used for the culture experiments. The animals were maintained in accor-
dance with the guidelines of the Science Council of Japan, and all experi-
ments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the Tokyo University of Agriculture.
Female fetal gonads without mesonephros were cultured in Transwell-COL
membranes (Corning) for 17 d. α-MEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
supplemented with 1.5 mM 2-O-α-D glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (Tokyo
Chemical Industry), 10 units/mL penicillin, and 10 μg/mL streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a basal medium (referred to here simply as
α-MEM). FBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), SPS (SAGE In-Vitro Fertiliza-
tion), β-estradiol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the estrogen receptor
antagonist ICI 182,780 (Tocris Bioscience) were added at the indicated con-
centrations for each experiment. Gonads were cultured for 17 d at 37 °C
under 5% CO2 and 95% air. Approximately half of the medium in each well
was replaced with fresh medium every other day (3, 11, 15, 38).
To optimize the organ culture conditions, the following conditions were
evaluated (Fig. S1E): culture for the complete 17-d period in α-MEM supple-
mented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (α-MEM + FBS), culture for the complete 17-d
period in α-MEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) SPS (α-MEM + SPS), culture in
α-MEM + FBS with a shift to α-MEM + SPS from day 5 to day 11 (α-MEM + FBS/
SPS), and culture in α-MEM + FBS with the addition of 1, 5, or 10 μM ICI from
day 5 to day 11 (α-MEM + FBS/1, 5, or 10 μM ICI).
After 17 d of organ culture, the secondary follicles were isolated from the
ovaries, using a Tungsten needle in L15 medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Follicles were
further cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 2% (wt/vol) PVP (Sigma-
Aldrich), 5% (vol/vol) FBS, and 0.1 IU/mL FSH (FOLLISTIM Injection 50; MSD).
Follicles were cultured on a Millicell membrane (Merck Millipore) in a 35-mm
culture dish (Falcon, Corning) for 12–16 d.
On day 20 of culture, follicles were treated with 0.1% collagenase type I
(Worthington Biochemicals) in L15 medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Then, the theca
layer of the follicles was removed by pipetting in part. Follicles were cultured
on Transwell-COL or Millicell membranes for another 9–13 d at 37 °C in me-
dium under 5% CO2 and 95% air. Approximately half the medium in each well
was replaced with fresh medium every other day (26).
