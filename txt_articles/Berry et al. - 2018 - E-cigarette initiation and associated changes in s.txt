background The role of electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) in product transitions has been debated.
Methods We used nationally representative data from 
the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study 
waves 1 (2013–2014) and 2 (2014–2015) to investigate 
the associations between e-cigarette initiation and 
cigarette cessation/reduction in the USA. We limited 
the sample to current cigarette smokers aged 25+ 
years who were not current e-cigarette users at wave 1. 
We modelled 30-day cigarette cessation and substantial 
reduction in cigarette consumption as a function of 
e-cigarette initiation between surveys using multivariable 
logistic regression.
Results Between waves 1 and 2, 6.9% of cigarette 
smokers who were not current e-cigarette users 
transitioned to former smokers. After adjusting for 
covariates, cigarette smokers who initiated e-cigarette 
use between waves and reported they used e-cigarettes 
daily at wave 2 had 7.88 (95% CI 4.45 to 13.95) times 
the odds of 30-day cigarette cessation compared with 
non-users of e-cigarettes at wave 2. Cigarette smokers 
who began using e-cigarettes every day and did not 
achieve cessation had 5.70 (95% CI 3.47 to 9.35) times 
the odds of reducing their average daily cigarette use 
by at least 50% between waves 1 and 2 compared with 
e-cigarette non-users.
Conclusions Daily e-cigarette initiators were more 
likely to have quit smoking cigarettes or reduced use 
compared with non-users. However, less frequent 
e-cigarette use was not associated with cigarette 
cessation/reduction. These results suggest incorporating 
frequency of e-cigarette use is important for developing 
a more thorough understanding of the association 
between e-cigarette use and cigarette cessation.
InTRoduCTIon
Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of 
death in the USA.1 The prevalence of cigarette 
smoking in the USA has declined considerably since 
the first Surgeon General’s report (from 42.4% in 
1964 to 15.1% in 2015),1 2 but smoking remains 
responsible for more than 400 
000 deaths each 
year.1
A large body of evidence demonstrates the bene-
fits of cigarette smoking cessation.1 3 Adults who 
quit smoking gain 6–10 years of life compared 
with those who continue to smoke, and quitting 
before the age of 40 years decreases mortality risk 
by approximately 90%.4 In 2015, 57.2% of adult 
smokers in the USA were advised to quit smoking 
by a doctor or health professional.5 Although the 
majority of smokers appear to be aware of the 
health benefits associated with smoking cessation, 
fewer than one in ten smokers successfully quit over 
the prior year.5
The prevalence of electronic cigarette (e-ciga-
rette) use has risen in recent years since e-cigarettes 
entered the market in 2007.6–8 Evidence on the 
efficacy of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids 
remains limited and inconclusive.9 10 Pooled anal-
ysis of two randomised controlled trials indicated 
that participants assigned to nicotine-containing 
e-cigarettes had 2.29 times the odds of 6-month 
cigarette cessation compared with the placebo 
group.11 Several cross-sectional studies,12–16 longi-
tudinal analyses17 18 and meta-analyses19–21 have 
also shown an association between e-cigarette 
use and increased quit attempts and successes. 
However, other studies, including a systematic 
review and meta-analysis, have raised doubts about 
the efficacy of e-cigarettes as cessation/reduction 
aids for smokers22–24 and highlighted that e-ciga-
rettes may not be a satisfying alternative to regular 
cigarettes.25 Furthermore, prior studies have shown 
dual product use is common, indicating e-cigarettes 
may be used as a complement rather than substitute 
to cigarette smoking.26
Prior studies investigating the role of e-cigarette 
use in cigarette cessation/reduction have largely 
relied on the analysis of non-representative samples, 
limiting the ability to generalise results to the popu-
lation at large. Our study aims to estimate how the 
uptake of e-cigarettes is associated with cigarette 
cessation and changes in cigarette smoking intensity 
in adults in the USA.
MeThods
design
We used data from waves 1 and 2 of the Popula-
tion Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) 
Study to investigate the associations between e-cig-
arette initiation and cigarette cessation/reduction. 
The PATH Study is a large, nationally representa-
tive, cohort study designed to collect data on use 
patterns, risk perceptions, attitudes and health 
outcomes associated with tobacco products.27 28 
Wave 1 data collection was carried out between 
September 2013 and December 2014 and included 
32 
320 adults aged ≥18. Data for wave 2 were 
 on 3 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

collected approximately 1 
year later, from October 2014 to 
October 2015. The weighted retention rate between waves was 
approximately 83%.27
sample
The current analysis was restricted to adults 25 years and older 
who were current established tobacco cigarette smokers but not 
current e-cigarette users at wave 1. From a total sample of 5832 
current smokers aged ≥25 years at wave 1 who were not current 
e-cigarette users, we excluded individuals with missing observa-
tions for poverty level (n=452), education (n=8), growing up 
in a house where someone smoked indoors (n=10), currently 
living with a cigarette smoker (n=13), average cigarette packs 
per day (n=181) and making a quit attempt in the year prior 
to wave 1 (n=11). Additionally, we excluded individuals if they 
were missing observations for cigarette smoking status (n=1) 
or e-cigarette use (n=32) at wave 2, leaving a final analytical 
sample of 5124.
Measures
Data on age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, education 
and region were collected during the wave 1 interview. In the 
public access PATH data, age was grouped using 10-year cate-
gories from 25 to 74 years and an open-ended category for ≥75 
years. Race/ethnicity was classified as non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic and other. Region was classified 
as living in the Northeast, Midwest, South or West. Income level 
was assessed based on reported annual household income and 
Health and Human Services guidelines for that year,29 30 resulting 
in the following categories: below poverty level, at or near 
poverty level and ≥twice 
poverty level.27 Education level was 
categorised as less than high school, high school or equivalent, 
some college, and bachelor’s/advanced degree. Data on living in 
a smoking household as a child, currently living with a cigarette 
smoker, frequency (some-day smoker, everyday smoker) and 
intensity (<1 
pack per day, 1–2 packs per day, ≥2 packs per day) 
of cigarette use, time to first cigarette in the morning (≤5 
min, 
6–29 
min, 30–59 
min, ≥60 
min), and prior quit attempt (within 
prior year) were assessed at wave 1.
outcome measures
Current smokers were defined as respondents who reported 
smoking more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently 
smoked every day or on some days.27 Former smokers at wave 2 
were defined as individuals who were current smokers at wave 
1, reported they did not smoke every day or some days at wave 
2, and had not smoked any cigarettes in the 30 days prior to 
wave 2. Smokers who did not smoke every day or some days but 
smoked ≥1 cigarettes over the past 30 days (n=133) were reclas-
sified as current smokers at wave 2 and were not considered to 
have quit smoking cigarettes. Consistent with prior analyses,18 31 
substantial reduction in cigarette consumption was defined as a 
reduction in average cigarettes smoked per day of at least 50% 
between wave 1 and wave 2.
E-cigarette use was assessed at wave 1 and wave 2. Respon-
dents were considered current e-cigarette users if they reported 
currently using e-cigarettes experimentally (no ‘regular’ e-ciga-
rette use), on some days or every day.27 E-cigarette users were 
also asked to report if their e-cigarette used cartridges, was refill-
able and used a tank system.
Analysis
For all multivariable models, we adjusted for sex, age, race/
ethnicity, region, household income, education, living in a

smoking household as a child, currently living with a cigarette 
smoker, frequency and intensity of cigarette use, time to first 
cigarette in the morning, and prior quit attempt. We used multi-
variable logistic regression to model 30-day cigarette cessation 
and substantial reduction in cigarette consumption as a func-
tion of e-cigarette initiation between waves 1 and 2. Individuals 
who had quit smoking cigarettes for at least 30 days were not 
included in the analysis of reduction in cigarette use.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness 
of our findings. First, we investigated the association between 
e-cigarette use and cessation after collapsing use into a single 
category regardless of frequency. Second, to assess the durability 
of cessation among e-cigarette users and non-users, we repeated 
our logistic regression modelling cigarette cessation using 90-day 
cigarette cessation (instead of 30-day cessation) as the outcome 
variable. Third, we explored the possibility that e-cigarette initi-
ation is a proxy for attempting to quit by limiting the primary 
30-day cessation analysis to cigarette smokers who reported a 
quit attempt within the year prior to wave 1. Fourth, we investi-
gated the effect of reclassifying smokers who started and stopped 
using e-cigarettes between wave 1 and wave 2 on the associa-
tion between e-cigarette use and cigarette cessation. Fifth, we 
performed a series of sensitivity analyses to model cigarette 
cessation as a function of combined frequency of e-cigarette use 
and various product characteristics, including use of cartridges, 
refillable e-cigarettes and e-cigarettes with tank systems. Finally, 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis for cigarette reduction, using 
multivariable linear regression to model changes in cigarette 
smoking intensity as defined by the average number of cigarettes 
smoked daily at each wave.
Analyses were performed using STATA V
.15. The wave 2 
sample weights were incorporated to adjust for unequal prob-
abilities of selection and non-response, and variances were esti-
mated using Taylor series linearisation with the SVY routine.27 
We considered a two-sided P value 
<0.05 
statistically significant.
ResulTs
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the study sample. 
Participants were 55% male and predominantly (69.8%) 
non-Hispanic white. Approximately 75% of the sample was 
younger than 55 years, and a majority of respondents were 
either high school graduates (39.7%) or had completed some 
college (32.3%). Most cigarette smokers in our sample were 
everyday smokers (82.4%) but consumed less than one pack per 
day (63.7%). Almost half (45.0%) reported attempting to quit 
smoking in the year prior to wave 1.
Among cigarette smokers who were not current e-cigarette 
users at wave 1, 337 (6.90%) individuals quit smoking cigarettes 
for at least 30 days (6.16% quit for at least 90 days). An addi-
tional 776 individuals (16.69%) achieved a substantial reduction 
(≥50%) in their average daily cigarette intake. The total number 
of new e-cigarette initiators at wave 2 was 663 (13.03%), with 
127 (2.58% of the total sample) beginning to use e-cigarettes 
every day, 178 (3.51%) starting to use e-cigarettes some days 
and 358 (6.94%) initiating experimental use. At wave 2, 14.44% 
of those who quit cigarettes and 15.39% of those who reduced 
their cigarette consumption reported current e-cigarette use, 
with the remaining respondents reporting no current use of 
either product.
In the logistic regression of 30-day cigarette cessation, ciga-
rette smokers who initiated daily e-cigarette use had 7.88 (95% 
CI 4.45 to 13.95) times the odds of quitting cigarette smoking 
compared with e-cigarette non-users (table 2). In contrast,

Figure 1 Predicted probabilities of (A) cigarette cessation and (B) reduction at wave 2 by electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) initiation, Population 
Assessment of Tobacco and Health (2013–2015). Predicted probabilities of achieving 30-day cigarette cessation and reduction as a function of 
e-cigarette initiation between waves were calculated using coefficients estimated from the models shown in tables 2 and 3. 
e-cigarette experimenters showed reduced odds of quitting ciga-
rette smoking (OR: 0.51; 95% 
CI 0.26 to 1.00). Additionally, 
individuals who were everyday smokers had decreased odds of 
achieving 30-day cigarette cessation compared with some-day 
smokers, while those who waited at least 60 
min to smoke in 
the mornings had increased odds of quitting compared with 
those who reported smoking their first cigarette within 5 
min 
of waking. 
New e-cigarette initiators who reported everyday use at wave 
2 had the highest predicted probability of achieving 30-day ciga-
rette cessation between wave 1 and wave 2 (31.20%; 95% 
CI 
20.97% to 41.42%). The probability of transitioning to former 
cigarette smoker was lower for non-users of e-cigarettes (6.60%; 
95% 
CI 5.70% to 7.49%), new e-cigarette experimenters 
(3.56%; 95% 
CI 1.34% to 5.78%) and new some-day e-cigarette 
users (3.55%; 95% 
CI 0.03% to 7.07%) (figure 1A).
At wave 1, the mean reported average daily cigarette use was 
13.97 cigarettes. Cigarette smokers who began using e-cigarettes 
every day and did not quit smoking cigarettes had 5.70 times 
the odds of reducing their daily cigarette use by at least 50% 
compared with e-cigarette non-users (95% 
CI 3.47 to 9.35) 
(table 3). Some-day e-cigarette users and e-cigarette experi-
menters did not significantly change their cigarette consumption 
compared with non-users. Cigarette smokers who smoked every 
day or grew up in a household with indoor smoking were less 
likely to reduce their cigarette use between waves. However, 
smokers who smoked at least one pack per day, waited at least 
60 
min for their first cigarette on waking or reported a recent 
quit attempt were more likely to reduce their cigarette use.
New e-cigarette initiators who reported everyday use at wave 
2 had the highest predicted probability of reducing their average 
daily cigarette use by at least 50% (48.80%; 95% 
CI 37.39% to 
60.21%). The probability of substantial reduction was lower for 
non-users of e-cigarettes (16.03%; 95% 
CI 14.69% to 17.37%), 
new e-cigarette experimenters (17.00%; 95% 
CI 12.97% to 
21.03%) and new some-day e-cigarette users (16.08%; 95% 
CI 
9.29% to 22.88%) (figure 1B).
The results of our sensitivity analyses can be found in 
online supplementary tables S1–S8. We found that collapsing 
all e-cigarette use into a single category substantially attenuated 
the association between e-cigarette use and 30-day cigarette 
cessation (online supplementary table S1). Similar results to the 
primary 30-day cessation model were produced in the model 
of 90-day cigarette cessation (online supplementary table S2) 
and the analysis restricted to individuals who reported a quit 
attempt in the last 12 months (online supplementary table S3). 
Additionally, reclassifying respondents who started and stopped 
using e-cigarettes between waves as a new level of e-cigarette use 
did not affect our results (online supplementary table S4).
We found e-cigarette initiators who used non-cartridge-based 
e-cigarettes daily were significantly more likely to report 
30-day cigarette cessation compared with e-cigarette non-users, 
while cartridge-based daily e-cigarette users showed no signif-
icant difference compared with non-users (online supplemen-
tary table S5). Similarly, e-cigarette initiators who primarily used 
refillable e-cigarettes daily were significantly more likely to quit 
compared with e-cigarette non-users, while non-refillable daily 
e-cigarette users showed no significant difference (online supple-
mentary table S6). Similar results were seen among new daily 
tank-based e-cigarette users who were significantly more likely 
to quit compared with e-cigarette non-users (online supplemen-
tary table S7).
Finally, the linear regression investigating the association of 
e-cigarette uptake and cigarette smoking intensity showed ciga-
rette smokers who began using e-cigarettes every day and did not 
quit smoking cigarettes reduced their average daily cigarette use 
by 5.60 (95% CI 3.52 to 7.68) more cigarettes than the reference 
group of e-cigarette non-users (online supplementary table S8).
dIsCussIon
The current study investigated the association of e-cigarette 
initiation and cigarette smoking cessation among adults in a 
nationally representative cohort. Among cigarette smokers, 
those who began using e-cigarettes every day had 5.7 times the 
odds of reducing their average daily cigarette use by at least 50% 
compared with e-cigarette non-users. We also observed cigarette 
smokers who initiated daily e-cigarette use had 7.9-fold higher 
odds of having quit smoking cigarettes for at least 30 days than 
e-cigarette non-users.
Prior analysis of PATH data from wave 1 found daily use 
of e-cigarettes was associated with being a former smoker.32 
Similarly, recent data from the 2014 National Health Inteview 
Survey (NHIS) indicate recently quit smokers were more than 
four times as likely to be daily users of e-cigarettes compared 
with daily cigarette smokers.33 Our results agree with data from 
the Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement (2014–
2015) suggesting that compared with non-users, e-cigarette

users were more likely to attempt to quit smoking cigarettes 
and to succeed in quitting.13 Furthermore, population-level 
trends show a significant increase in the overall rate of cigarette 
smoking cessation in the USA from 2010–2011 to 2014–2015 
alongside a similar rise in e-cigarette use, suggesting e-cigarettes 
may contribute to the increase in population tobacco cessation 
rates.13
Consistent with our analysis, prior studies have shown 
frequent e-cigarette use is associated with higher likelihood of 
reducing the quantity of cigarettes smoked.18 34 Some smokers 
may be using e-cigarettes to reduce their cigarette consumption 
as a stepping stone to cessation; evidence suggests smokers who 
reduce the number of daily cigarettes smoked are more likely to 
attempt to quit and successfully quit.35
In contrast to our findings, a recent meta-analysis of e-cig-
arettes and cigarette smoking cessation, which included four 
longitudinal studies, showed the odds of quitting cigarettes were 
28% lower in those who used e-cigarettes compared with those 
who did not use e-cigarettes.23 However, few studies included 
in the meta-analysis reported on the intensity of e-cigarette use. 
Similarly, a study using the 2010 Tobacco Use Supplement of 
the Current Population Survey found ever-use of e-cigarettes was 
not significantly associated with change in cigarettes smoked per 
day36 but did not report intensity of e-cigarette use.
Our analysis demonstrates the frequency of e-cigarette use 
makes a difference in the odds of cigarette cessation/reduction. 
These results are consistent with existing findings that daily e-cig-
arette users are more likely to attempt to quit smoking18 37 and 
achieve cigarette cessation compared with non-users.37–39 Recent 
evidence shows more than 70% of recent quitters who used 
e-cigarettes were still using e-cigarettes daily, suggesting frequent 
use may be critical to preventing relapse.13 Prior evidence has 
also shown daily e-cigarette use is associated with higher likeli-
hood of reducing the quantity of cigarettes smoked.18
Although daily e-cigarette users seem to gain the most benefits 
in terms of increased likelihood of cigarette cessation/reduction, 
they represent a small proportion of e-cigarette users among 
smokers. In our sample, only 19.82% of smokers who initiated 
e-cigarette use between waves reported daily e-cigarette use 
compared with 26.93% who reported some-day use and 53.25% 
who reported experimental use. The e-cigarette experimenters 
and some-day users, who comprise a greater proportion of users, 
may represent dual product users who are using e-cigarettes in 
conjunction with tobacco cigarettes instead of as a substitute, 
raising doubts about the net benefits of e-cigarette use to adult 
smokers. Additional research is needed to understand the impact 
of dual product use on trends in cigarette use.
In addition to frequency of use, our supplementary analyses 
suggest e-cigarette product characteristics play a role in cigarette 
cessation. We found new daily e-cigarette users who used e-cig-
arettes without cartridges, refillable e-cigarettes and tank-based 
e-cigarettes increased their likelihood of 30-day cigarette cessa-
tion compared with non-users. E-cigarettes that use cartridges 
are typically first-generation e-cigarette products sometimes 
referred to as ‘cigalikes’ due to their similar appearance to tradi-
tional cigarettes.40 Refillable and tank-based e-cigarettes, on the 
other hand, represent second-generation and third-generation 
products.41 Our findings suggest users of second-generation and 
third-generation e-cigarettes are more likely to quit smoking 
cigarettes, possibly because later generation models have been 
shown to be more effective at delivering nicotine.41 42 These 
findings are consistent with prior evidence showing tank users 
were more likely and cigalike users were less likely to have quit 
compared with e-cigarette non-users.39

Research paper
The potential benefits of e-cigarettes as cigarette smoking 
cessation/reduction aids must be carefully weighed against the 
potential harms. Many researchers and public health experts 
believe using e-cigarettes carries less health risks than smoking 
cigarettes.43 44 Small, short-term studies of e-cigarette use 
suggest e-cigarettes have a smaller impact on cardiovascular 
health45 46 and expose users to substantially fewer carcino-
gens compared with cigarettes.47 However, other studies indi-
cate e-cigarette use may have detrimental short-term health 
effects.48–50 Lack of evidence on the long-term impact of 
e-cigarette use means the true public health impact is not yet 
known.
Furthermore, many public health experts worry e-cigarettes 
renormalise cigarettes, the use of which has become stigmatised 
in recent decades, and serve as a precursor to smoking ciga-
rettes.44 A growing body of evidence, including a systematic 
review and meta-analysis,51 has demonstrated e-cigarette use 
may be associated with the uptake of cigarettes among youth and 
young adults in the USA,52–54 the UK55 and Mexico.56 However, 
some research has disputed this claim.57 58 Future research 
should continue to investigate the association of e-cigarette initi-
ation and tobacco cigarette use using longitudinal data and begin 
assessing the long-term health consequences of e-cigarette and 
dual product use.
The primary strength of our analysis is we provide evidence on 
the association between e-cigarette initiation specifically and ciga-
rette smoking cessation/reduction. The temporal element provided 
using PATH cohort data provides a vital aspect missing from many 
prior studies. Additionally, the data used in this analysis come from 
a large, nationally representative survey of the US adult population. 
Furthermore, our analysis examines outcomes of interest, assesses 
e-cigarette use for cessation/reduction as the exposure of interest, 
includes appropriate comparison groups, measures dose of e-cig-
arette use and assesses e-cigarette product type, as proposed by 
Villanti et al59, to determine if a study provides sufficient informa-
tion to answer whether e-cigarettes can facilitate smoking cessation 
and/or reduction. Finally, the results of our analysis were robust to 
all sensitivity checks conducted, including varying the definition 
of former smoker to 90-day cessation and limiting the analysis to 
smokers with prior quit attempts.
Our study is subject to several limitations. One potential limita-
tion is we did not use clinical measures to confirm smoking 
status; the present analysis relies exclusively on self-reported 
data. However, prior validation studies have shown self-reported 
cigarette smoking behaviours among adults are consistent and 
reliable.60 Although we used two waves of data, we cannot estab-
lish how recently behaviours changed between waves, nor can 
we establish the order of those changes; therefore, we cannot 
conclude e-cigarette initiation preceded cigarette cessation or 
reduction. However, it is not required that e-cigarette use precede 
a quit attempt in order to impact cessation as preventing relapse 
is a key component of durable cessation. Our conclusions are 
also limited by the relatively short follow-up time between wave 
1 (2013–2014) and wave 2 (2014–2015) of the survey. Whereas 
more than half of adult smokers report past-year quit attempts, less 
than 10% stopped smoking cigarettes for at least 1 
year.61 Further 
estimates suggest only 3%–5% of quitters who attempt to quit 
without treatment successfully abstain from smoking cigarettes for 
6–12 months.62 Due to the short follow-up time between waves, 
our analysis cannot establish the sustainability of cigarette cessation 
among individuals who transitioned from current smokers at wave 
1 to former smokers at wave 2.
ConClusIon
We found daily e-cigarette initiators were more likely to 
have quit smoking cigarettes or reduced use compared with 
non-users. However, less frequent e-cigarette use was not asso-
ciated with cigarette cessation/reduction. Our findings add to 
the growing evidence suggesting adult smokers in the USA are 
using e-cigarettes to help themselves quit smoking cigarettes 
or reduce their cigarette use. Understanding the implications 
of e-cigarette use for product transitions away from tobacco 
use may help inform the Federal Drug Administration Center 
for Tobacco Products on the expected contribution of e-ciga-
rettes to future trends in tobacco cigarette use and the burden 
of tobacco-related disease. Additionally, findings from this 
study can inform future health education and communication 
efforts around cigarette smoking cessation and harm reduction 
strategies.
What this paper adds
 
► Prior literature suggests the possible effectiveness of 
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for cigarette smoking 
cessation, but most existing evidence relied on non-
representative samples, limiting the ability to draw 
generalisable conclusions.
 
► Using data from wave 1 and wave 2 of the Population 
Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, we show daily 
e-cigarette initiators were more likely to have reduced their 
cigarette use and quit smoking cigarettes compared with 
non-users.
 
► The same trends were not observed with e-cigarette initiators 
reporting experimental or some-day use, suggesting the 
frequency of e-cigarette use may play an important role in 
cigarette smoking cessation/reduction.
