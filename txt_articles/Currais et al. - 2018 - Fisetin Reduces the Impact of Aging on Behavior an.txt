Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is rarely addressed in the context of aging even though there is an overlap in pathology. We previously used a phenotypic 
screening platform based on old age–associated brain toxicities to identify the flavonol fisetin as a potential therapeutic for AD and other age-
related neurodegenerative diseases. Based on earlier results with fisetin in transgenic AD mice, we hypothesized that fisetin would be effective 
against brain aging and cognitive dysfunction in rapidly aging senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, a model for sporadic AD and 
dementia. An integrative approach was used to correlate protein expression and metabolite levels in the brain with cognition. It was found that 
fisetin reduced cognitive deficits in old SAMP8 mice while restoring multiple markers associated with impaired synaptic function, stress, and 
inflammation. These results provide further evidence for the potential benefits of fisetin for the treatment of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Currently, there are no disease-modifying drugs for any age-asso-
ciated neurological diseases. This is at least in part due to the fact 
that the vast majority of these diseases arise from a confluence of 
multiple toxic insults to the brain that accumulate during normal 
aging and interact with lifestyle, environmental, and genetic risk 
factors with varying degrees of penetrance. For example, although 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is defined in terms of plaque and tangle 
pathology, it is frequently associated with other detrimental events 
such as microvascular damage and inflammation (1). Therefore, it is 
unlikely that hitting a single target will result in significant benefits 
to patients with AD (2). This conclusion has been largely born out 
by the failure of numerous clinical trials for single target drugs in 
AD (3). Nevertheless, current drug research efforts continue to be 
almost exclusively focused on single protein targets and the identifi-
cation of small molecules that can modulate these targets with high 
affinity (1). Our laboratory uses a drug discovery paradigm based on 
a set of cell-based screening assays that mimic numerous aspects of 
old age–associated neurodegeneration and AD pathology (4). This 
approach has led to the identification of fisetin, a neuroprotective 
flavonol that enhances memory in normal animals (5) and in AD 
transgenic mice (6). Fisetin is also protective in animal models of 
other age-associated neurological disorders including Huntington’s 
disease (7) and stroke (8,9).
Although AD transgenic rodents have been used as state-of-the-
art models for AD drug candidate testing, the vast majority rely on 
familial AD (FAD) mutations. Unfortunately, none of the drug candi-
dates identified using these models has translated to the clinic. Given 
that FAD accounts for less than 1% of all AD cases (10), animal 
models that more accurately reflect the predominant sporadic forms 
of AD and other dementias are needed (11).
Age is by far the greatest risk factor for AD (11). One model 
of aging is the senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mouse that 
exhibits a progressive, age-associated decline in brain function simi-
lar to human AD patients (reviewed in (12, 13)). As they age, SAMP8 
mice develop an early deterioration in learning and memory as well 
as a number of pathophysiological alterations in the brain includ-
ing increased oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular impairment, 
gliosis, Aβ accumulation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Using an

 integrative multiomics approach, we recently identified a number of 
behavioral and physiological changes that are altered with aging in 
these mice (14). Moreover, we showed that the AD drug candidate, 
J147, reduced AD-associated pathology, and many metabolic aspects 
of aging in old SAMP8 mice (14).
Since fisetin and J147 were both selected based on their ability 
to prevent old age–related brain toxicities and both are effective in 
transgenic mouse models of AD, we wanted to determine if fisetin was 
also protective in the SAMP8 model of aging. Changes in behavior, 
protein expression, and the levels of metabolites in old SAMP8 mice 
fed with control or fisetin diets were compared with young SAMP8 
control mice. These data demonstrate the ability of fisetin to suppress 
many of these changes while reducing some aspects of aging.
Methods
Study Design
The aim of this project was to investigate whether the flavonol fise-
tin protects SAMP8 mice from aging and AD-associated pathology 
and to assay the associated metabolic changes. Seventeen 3-month-
old male SAMP8 mice were fed with control diet (LabDiet 5015, 
TestDiet, Richmond, IN) and eighteen 3-month-old male SAMP8 
mice were fed with fisetin diet (LabDiet 5015 + 500 ppm fisetin, 
TestDiet) until they reached 10 months old. At this age, SAMP8 
mice present a strong phenotype (15). The dose of fisetin used was 
500 ppm (~25 mg/kg/day), which previously proved effective in AD 
transgenic mice (6). Fourteen 3-month-old male SAMP8 mice were 
used as the young control group. The SAMP8 mice are an inbred 
strain and, as such, young SAMP8 mice were chosen as controls for 
young age. Given the 7-month duration of the feeding paradigm, 
the effect of fisetin diet could only be assessed in old SAMP8 mice, 
and any age-related changes defined by the comparison to the young 
SAMP8 animals. All mice were randomly assigned to experimental 
groups. The number of mice per group was determined based on pre-
vious experiments (15) and was sufficient to attain statistical power. 
Six old SAMP8 mice fed with control diet and five old SAMP8 mice 
fed with fisetin diet died throughout the course of this study includ-
ing during the behavioral testing. Behavioral testing was carried out 
1 month prior to sacrifice and collection of biological material. Data 
were analyzed by blinded researchers when appropriate.
SAMP8 Mice
The SAMP8 line was acquired from Harlan Laboratories (UK). 
Mouse body weights were measured regularly and no significant dif-
ferences were found between the groups (Supplementary Figure S1).
Behavioral Assays
Open field
The open field test was performed using MED Associates hardware 
and the Activity Monitor software according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (MED Associates Inc, St. Albans, VT). Animals were indi-
vidually placed into clear Plexiglas boxes (40.6 × 40.6 × 38.1 cm) 
surrounded by multiple bands of photo beams and optical sensors 
that measure horizontal and vertical activity. Their movement was 
detected as breaks within the beam matrices and automatically 
recorded for 30 minutes.
Elevated plus maze
The maze consisted of four arms (two open without walls and two 
enclosed by 15.25-cm high walls) 30-cm long and 5-cm wide in the 
shape of a plus. A video-tracking system (Noldus EthoVision) was used 
to automatically collect behavioral data. The software was installed on a 
PC with a digital video camera mounted overhead on the ceiling, which 
automatically detected and recorded when mice entered the open or 
closed arms of the maze and the time spent in each. Mice were habitu-
ated to the room 24 hours before testing and habituated to the maze for 
1 minute before testing by placing them in the center of the maze and 
blocking entry to the arms. Mice were then tested for a 5-minute period 
and their behavior recorded. Disinhibition was measured by comparing 
the time spent on the open arms to time spent on the closed arms.
Object recognition
Mice were tested in a standard home cage. Phase 1 (Habituation): 
Each mouse was placed into the apparatus (no objects present) for 
two 10-minute sessions separated by 1–4 hours to habituate to test-
ing environment. Phase 2 (Training): Two identical Velcro-backed 
objects (object “A”) were attached to designated corners of the 
apparatus. The mouse was placed into the apparatus opposite to the 
objects and recorded by a camera for 10 minutes. Phase 3 (Test): 
One hour after training, the test phase began. Only one of the objects 
was replaced with a new object (object “B”). The mouse was placed 
into the apparatus opposite to the objects and recorded for 5 min-
utes. The apparatus was wiped and objects cleaned with 70% alco-
hol to remove odors between mice. “object recognition index” was 
calculated by dividing the amount of time spent with object B by the 
total time spent with objects A + B and multiplied by 100.
Barnes maze
The maze consisted of a flat circular surface (36” diameter) with 
20 equally spaced holes (2” diameter) along the outer edge. One of 
the holes led to a dark hide box whereas the other 19 led to false 
boxes that were too small to be entered. The latency to enter the 
hide box was recorded. The test was conducted in three phases. 
Phase 1 (Training): A hide box was placed under one of the holes. 
Animals were placed into an opaque cylinder in the center of the 
maze for 30 seconds to promote spatial disorientation at the start 
of the test. After 30 seconds, the cylinder was removed and the 
animal explored the maze until it found and entered the hide box. 
The number of incorrect entries was scored. If the mouse failed to 
enter the box within 3 minutes, it was gently led into the box. The 
animal remained in the box for an additional 20 seconds before it 
was removed from the box and gently placed into the home cage. 
Training is repeated three times a day for 4 days. The location of 
the hide box remained the same during every trial, but it was shifted 
between subjects to reduce the potential for unintended intramaze 
cues. Phase 2 (Retention): This phase measures retention of spatial 
memory following a delay. After a 2-day break from training, each 
animal was retested for a 1-day, three-trial session using the same 
hide box location as before. Phase 3 (Reversal): This phase examines 
memory reversal. On the day following the retention phase, a new 
hide box location was established 180 degrees to the original loca-
tion. The same method as before was used and trials were repeated 
three times a day over two consecutive days.
Tissue Preparation
Mice were anesthetized and their blood collected by cardiac punc-
ture. After perfusing with phosphate-buffered saline, their brains 
were removed. Half of the brain was fixed and processed for his-
tology and the other half was dissected (to collect cortex and hip-
pocampus) and prepared for Western blot (WB), eicosanoid, and 
global metabolomic analysis as described (14).

 Western Blotting
WBs were carried out as described previously (14). The primary 
antibodies used were: HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-actin (#5125, 
1/20,000), HSP40 (#4871, 1/1000), HSP60 (#4870, 1/5000), HSP70 
(#4872, 1/5000), HSP90 (#4877, 1/5000), SAPK/JNK (#9252, 
1/1000), Phospho-SAPK/JNK Thr183/Tyr185 (#4668, 1/1000), 
p25/35 (#2680, 1/1000) from Cell Signaling Technology; Arc (#sc-
15325, 1/2000), GFAP (#AB5804, 1/5000), SAP102 (#AB5170, 
1/400) from Millipore; Homer 1 (#SAB1411661, 1/1000) from 
Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondaries goat anti-
rabbit, goat anti-mouse, or rabbit anti-goat (Biorad) diluted 1/5000 
were used.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously (6). 
Anti-Iba-1 (#019-19741, 1/4000, from Wako) and biotinylated rab-
bit secondary antibody (#BA1000, 1/400 from Vector Laboratories) 
were used. The number of microglia per mm2 of hippocampus was 
quantified using the Image J software (NIH). Total counts in 2–4 
sections per eight mouse brains of each group were determined in 
an unbiased fashion.
Eicosanoid Analysis
Eicosanoids were prepared and analyzed as described previously (6).
Metabolomic Analysis
Metabolomic analyses were conducted at Metabolon as described 
previously (14). For statistical analyses and data display, any missing 
values were assumed to be below the limits of detection and imputed 
with the compound minimum (minimum value imputation). An 
estimate of the false discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated to 
take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in 
metabolomic-based studies, with Q <0.05 used as an indication of 
high confidence in a result. Welch’s two-sample t test was used to 
identify biochemicals that differed significantly between experimen-
tal groups.
Bioinformatics and Statistics
Data in figures are presented as group mean ± SD or as box-and-
whisker plots indicating the group minimum, lower quartile, median, 
upper quartile, and group maximum.
Statistical analysis of the three groups was carried out by one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey–Kramer 
multiple comparison post-hoc test was used. For data regarding 
multiple time points, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and post-
hoc Bonferroni-corrected t tests were applied. GraphPad Prism 6 
was used and significance of difference was indicated as *p <.05, 
 
**p <.01, and ***p <.001.
Study Approval
All experiments were performed in accordance with the U.S. Public 
Health Service Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and 
protocols approved by the IACUC at the Salk Institute.
Results
To test the effects of fisetin on the development of the SAMP8 phe-
notype, two groups of 3-month-old mice were fed with control 
or fisetin diet for an additional 7 months, while another group of 
3-month-old mice was used as a young control group. Since the 
SAMP8 mice are an inbred strain, young SAMP8 mice were chosen 
as the most appropriate control. Given the 7-month duration of the 
feeding paradigm, the effects of the fisetin diet could only be assessed 
in old SAMP8 mice, and age-related changes were defined by com-
parison to the young SAMP8 animals.
Fisetin Prevents Cognitive and Locomotor Deficits 
With Age in SAMP8 Mice
We started by investigating whether fisetin could prevent age-asso-
ciated cognitive decline in old SAMP8 mice using the Barnes maze 
(Figure 1A), the object recognition test (Figure 1B), and the elevated 
plus maze (Figure 1C). The Barnes maze is used to analyze spatial 
learning and hippocampal-dependent memory. In this assay, mice 
use visual cues to locate a hidden box. With repeated trials, ani-
mals with an intact memory show a significant reduction in the time 
(latency) to locate the box. If the box is moved to another location 
in the maze (reversal test), normal animals rapidly disengage from 
the previously learned information and relearn the new location. No 
changes between the three groups were found in the escape laten-
cies during the learning and the retention phases (data not shown). 
However, when tested during the reversal phase, which is more sen-
sitive to smaller deficits in learning and memory, the old SAMP8 
mice showed a deficit relative to the young mice in their ability to 
relearn the new location of the escape box (Figure 1A). Importantly, 
the ability of the old fisetin-fed mice to relearn the new location was 
essentially identical to that of the young mice.
The object recognition test evaluates short-term recognition 
memory and is based on the spontaneous tendency of mice to spend 
more time exploring a novel object than a familiar one. The choice to 
explore the novel object reflects the use of learning and recognition 
memory. There was a significant decrease in the recognition index 
with age in SAMP8 mice, which was prevented by fisetin (Figure 1B).
The elevated plus maze examines disinhibition behavior based on 
the aversion of normal mice to open spaces. Dementia is clinically 
associated with disinhibition and AD mouse models tend to exhibit 
increased disinhibition (6,16). Accordingly, old SAMP8 mice spent 
significantly more time in the open arms compared to the young 
SAMP8 mice (Figure 1C). The time in the open arms was decreased 
modestly but nonsignificantly by fisetin. Altogether these data show 
that fisetin prevents the deterioration of several aspects of behavior 
and memory that are altered in old SAMP8 mice.
By monitoring the spontaneous behavior of mice in the open 
field assay, we found a decline in activity parameters between the 
young and the old SAMP8 mice (Figure 1D–F and (14)). Fisetin had 
a positive effect on locomotor activity as it slightly improved the 
average velocity (Figure 1D) and significantly increased the num-
ber of vertical counts (Figure 1E) and time vertical (Figure 1F) in 
the old SAMP8 mice. Fisetin had no effect on the body weights 
(Supplementary Figure S1A) or food consumption (Supplementary 
Figure S1B).
Behavioral Deficits in Old SAMP8 Are Associated 
With Dysregulation of Homeostatic Responses in 
the Brain 
That Are Restored by Fisetin
We next investigated if the decline in the cognitive performance of 
old SAMP8 mice and the therapeutic effects of fisetin were associ-
ated with changes in specific proteins relevant to neuronal function 
and stress. The expression of three proteins associated with synaptic 
function, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc),

 Homer, and synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102), all decreased 
in old mice compared to young mice (Figure 2A–C and (14)), 
and treatment with fisetin partly to almost fully prevented these 
decreases. It was then asked if these changes were accompanied by 
alterations in the levels of proteins involved in the cellular responses 
to stress relevant to aging and AD (Figure 2D–F). Although the lev-
els of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were not significantly altered 
between groups (not shown), changes in HSP40, HSP60, and HSP90 
were detected in the old SAMP8 mice (Figure 2D–F and (14)). Fisetin 
significantly increased HSP90 levels to those found in the young con-
trol mice and partially increased the levels of HSP40 (Figure 2D and 
F). In contrast, HSP60 levels increased with aging and this increase 
was significantly prevented by fisetin (Figure 2E).
Fisetin Decreases Brain Inflammation in old 
SAMP8 Mice
Given the relevance of inflammation to aging and AD, a characteri-
zation of the effects of fisetin on the inflammatory status of the aged 
SAMP8 brain was carried out. We previously reported an increased 
expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for 
astrocyte activation (17), in the hippocampus of old SAMP8 mice 
(14,15). We found (15) that there was a direct correlation between 
the levels of GFAP as determined by immunohistochemistry and 
the levels as determined by Western blotting. In the current study, 
GFAP expression in the hippocampus of the old SAMP8 mice, as 
determined by Western blotting, was significantly reduced by fisetin 
(Figure 3A).
In transgenic AD mice, it has been suggested that p25, the cleavage 
product of the Cdk5 activator p35, drives astrocyte activation (18). 
However, in the old SAMP8 mice, the p25/p35 ratio was decreased 
relative to the young mice and fisetin had no significant effect rela-
tive to either the young or old mice (Figure 3B). In contrast, WB 
analysis revealed an activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/
Jun-amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), determined by its phospho-
rylation, in the hippocampus of old SAMP8 mice (Figure 3C and 
(14)). Previously, we showed that SAPK/JNK activation was a good 
marker of microglial activation (19). Importantly, fisetin prevented 
the activation of SAPK/JNK in the old SAMP8 mice. Although the 
number of microglia increased in the hippocampus of old mice com-
pared to young mice (14), fisetin did not significantly alter their num-
ber (Figure 3D).
A detailed analysis of eicosanoids in the brain cortex was also 
conducted. Eicosanoids are a class of bioactive lipid mediators that 
are potent regulators of inflammatory responses (20). In the SAMP8 
mice, fisetin significantly increased the levels of docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA) (Figure 4) and significantly reduced the levels of many 
of its products of nonenzymatic oxidation (8-HDoHE, 10-HDoHE, 
11-HDoHE, 13-HDoHE, 14-HDoHE, 16-HDoHE, 17-HdoHE, 
and 20-HDoHE) as well as the levels of nonenzymatically oxidized 
metabolites of arachidonic acid (8-HETE and 9-HETE) and linoleic 
acid (9-HODE) (Figure 4). These findings suggest that fisetin may 
reduce the pro-oxidant status in the brains of old animals.
The levels of the epoxides 9,10-DiHOME and 12,13-DiHOME, 
which are derived enzymatically from linoleic acid and associated 
with an inflammatory response (21), were slightly increased in old 
animals and were reduced with fisetin treatment (9,10-DiHOME 
was significantly reduced). In addition, several COX (PGD2, TXB2, 
and PGF2α), 5-LOX (5-HETE and 9-HOTre), and 15-LOX (15-
HETE) metabolites, all of which are associated with inflammation 
(22–24), were significantly lowered by fisetin (Figure 4).

old SAMP8 mice. Spatial learning/memory and recognition memory 
were evaluated by the Barnes maze (A) and object recognition (B) assays, 
respectively. The elevated plus maze (C) was used to measure disinhibition.

assessed in young mice and old SAMP8 mice fed with control or fisetin diets

 The Beneficial Effects of Fisetin on the SAMP8 
Phenotype Are Associated With Alterations in 
Specific Brain and Plasma Metabolites
Because major metabolic alterations take place with aging, a global 
metabolic profiling study was carried out with blood plasma and 
brain cortical tissue in order to understand the possible therapeutic 
effects of fisetin on brain and whole body health. As described pre-
viously (14), 166 of 593 (28.0%) and 82 of 493 (16.6%) assayed 
biochemicals differed significantly in the plasma and cortex, respec-
tively, between young and old SAMP8 mice. Although treatment 
with fisetin only resulted in changes in 11 metabolites in the plasma 
relative to untreated old SAMP8 mice, most of these changes 
resulted in a prevention of the effects of aging mainly associated 
with metabolites involved in amino acid (4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 
N-acetyl tyrosine, indoleacetate, and homocitruline) and lipid 
(caprylate, sphingosine, and taurourso deoxycholate) metabolism 
(Figure 5). Interestingly, several of these metabolites (4-hydroxy-
phenylacetate, indoleacetate, and taurourso deoxycholate) are 
mainly derived from the gut microbiome (25,26). Similarly, in the 
brain, although fisetin only altered 12 metabolites relative to the 
untreated, old SAMP8 mice, most of these changes also resulted in 
the maintenance of the young phenotype including metabolites that 
play a role in amino acid (glycine, 2-hydroxybutyrate, trans-4-hy-
droxyproline), nucleotide (adenylosuccinate, uridine monophos-
phate, N-acetyl-beta-alanine, and 2ʹ-deoxycytidine), and lipid 
(heptanoate, 2-stearoyl-glyceroPEE, and stearoyl-arachidonoyl-
glyceroPC) metabolism (Figure 5).
Discussion
We used an integrated experimental approach to investigate the 
potential therapeutic properties of the flavonol fisetin in the SAMP8 
model of aging and early sporadic AD. SAMP8 mice develop a pro-
gressive, age-associated decline in brain function, as well as patho-
physiological features similar to those found in the brains of sporadic 
AD patients. Therefore, they may represent an excellent model for 
studying the relationship between aging and sporadic AD (12–14). 
Our data with fisetin suggest that modulation of a small subset of 
the physiological changes associated with aging can have a major 
influence on memory impairment, an alteration directly related to 
the clinical hallmarks of AD. Thus, these data support and extend 
our results on the beneficial effects of fisetin in a transgenic model 
of AD (6).
Given the positive action of fisetin on cognitive function in the 
old SAMP8 mice, we first examined its effects on several proteins 
involved in synaptic function whose expression was previously 
found to be decreased in old SAMP8 mice (14). Importantly, it has 
been suggested that AD is primarily a synaptic disorder with the 
number of neocortical synapses being a better correlate of cognition 
than either beta amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles (27). The 
levels of the postsynaptic density scaffolding protein Homer 1a were 
recently shown to be positively correlated with cognitive function 
in aged mice (28), consistent with our observation that the levels 
were increased by fisetin treatment. Arc is necessary for durable LTP 
and lasting memories. Several lines of evidence (29) suggest that dys-
regulation of Arc expression in the hippocampus could contribute 
to cognitive impairment in AD and aging. Fisetin also maintained 
Arc levels in the old SAMP8 mouse brains. The postsynaptic scaffold 
protein SAP102 has been shown to be decreased in human AD brains 
with the level of reduction directly correlating with disease severity 
(30). Fisetin prevented the loss of SAP102 in the old SAMP8 mouse 
brains. Together, the maintenance of the levels of these proteins in 
the aging brain may contribute to the positive effects of fisetin on 
cognitive function in the old SAMP8 mice. We then asked whether 
fisetin might also modulate age-associated stress pathways whose 
inappropriate activation could contribute to cognitive dysfunction.
HSPs represent a major cellular defense against the proteotoxic 
stress that is characteristic of age-related neurodegenerative disor-
ders. The consequences of HSP expression depend on the type of 
HSP, the disease, cell type, and brain region (31). The changes in 
HSP40, 60, and 90 observed in the hippocampus of old SAMP8 mice 
are indicative of stress, and fisetin maintained the levels of HSP60 
and 90 at those seen in young mice. Consistent with our results, 
HSP60 has been reported to increase in senescent cells both in vitro 
and in vivo and may contribute to the age-dependent increase in 
inflammation (32).
Indeed, one of the most prominent manifestations of stress dur-
ing aging is the production of inflammatory mediators accompanied 
by metabolic alterations. Although clinical trials with a few antiin-
flammatory drugs failed to prevent AD disease progression, epide-
miological studies suggest that long-term use of antiinflammatory 
drugs may reduce the risk (33). Our data (14) showed an increase in

 inflammatory parameters in old SAMP8 mice. In the CNS, inflam-
mation is often characterized by the activation of glial cells, mainly 
astrocytes and microglia. This age-associated phenotype is charac-
teristic of the AD brain (34). Old SAMP8 mice also show astrocyte 
activation as determined by both Western blotting and immunohis-
tochemistry for GFAP (14,15), and we demonstrate here that fisetin 
reduces the age-dependent increase in GFAP expression in the hip-
pocampus as determined by Western blotting.
Recently, using mice overexpressing p25 specifically in neurons, 
it was shown that p25 induces neuroinflammation that is associated 
with astrocyte activation and synaptic damage (35,36). Previously, 
we found that in transgenic AD mice, fisetin prevented the highly 
significant increase in p25 levels in the AD mice and greatly reduced 
the p25/p35 ratio in both wild-type and AD mice as well as reduc-
ing astrocyte activation (6). However, in the SAMP8 mice, we found 
a decrease in p25 levels with aging despite an increase in astrocyte 
activation. Although several treatments have been shown to reduce 
p25 levels in SAMP8 mice (e.g., (37, 38)), the levels of p25 in old and 
young SAMP8 mice have not been previously compared. Moreover, 
recently, it was suggested (39) that the increase in p25 levels in 
transgenic AD mice is an artifact due to the overexpression of the 
amyloid precursor protein and presenilin. Importantly, the results 
presented here showing that fisetin can reduce astrocyte activation in 
the absence of increases in p25 indicate that fisetin’s beneficial effects 
are not specific to transgenic AD mice.
Microglia are the resident macrophages of the brain and play a 
central role during inflammation in the aging and AD brains (40). 
Although fisetin did not reduce the increased number of microglia 
cells found in the hippocampus of old SAMP8 mice, it reduced acti-
vation of the stress-induced kinase SAPK/JNK, which we had pre-
viously shown to be a good marker of microglial activation (19). 
Moreover, SAPK/JNK is activated in AD brains (41). An antiinflam-
matory action of fisetin in the brain is further supported by con-
sistent decreases in a number of COX, 5-LOX, 15-LOX, and P450 
epoxide metabolites with fisetin treatment. In transgenic AD mice, 
we also found that fisetin modulated the levels of several products of 
both COX and LOX metabolism (6).
Among the most interesting observations with fisetin is that it 
significantly increased the level of DHA in the brain. DHA is the 
primary structural fatty acid in the human brain and has been linked 
to cognitive performance. Although low plasma levels of DHA are 
associated with cognitive decline in elderly and AD patients, higher 
DHA intake and plasma levels inversely correlate with AD risk (42). 
DHA supplementation in aged animals enhances learning and mem-
ory and protects against Aβ and tau pathology in AD mouse models 
(42–44). The increase in DHA with fisetin could be a consequence 
of its reduced nonenzymatic oxidation, as suggested by lower levels 
of its oxidized metabolites, HDoHes. Importantly, similar effects of 
fisetin on DHA oxidation were seen in transgenic AD mice (6).
Aging is accompanied by strong metabolic alterations at the 
organismal level that are often associated with mitochondrial dys-
function (45,46). Our analysis of the metabolomic profile of the 
plasma of old SAMP8 mice revealed global pathway changes regard-
ing the metabolism of amino acids, peptides, and lipids in com-
parison to the young SAMP mice (14). However, in contrast, to the 
results with J147 (14), fisetin only altered a few of these metabolites. 
Nevertheless, its effects on behavior were very similar to those of 
J147 (14). Moreover, it modulated the levels of proteins involved 
in synaptic function and inflammation in a manner similar to J147 
(14). Thus, these results suggest that at least with respect to cogni-
tive function, there may be a core set of pathways that contribute 
to dysfunction with aging and it is sufficient to modulate just these 
pathways to have a beneficial effect. However, the broader effects of 
J147 on the aging phenotype (14) may be important for protecting 
other functions that were not examined.
In summary, the purpose of this study was to determine if, similar 
to its effects in transgenic AD mice, fisetin could also prove beneficial 
in old SAMP8 mice, a potential model of sporadic AD. By assessing 
the relationship between aging and the therapeutic effects of fisetin 
in the SAMP8 mouse model of aging and sporadic AD, we identified 
several key processes that correlated well with its beneficial effects 
on cognitive function. These include the modulation of proteins 
involved in synaptic function and inflammation. Changes in both 
of these are implicated in the cognitive decline seen in normal aging 
as well as the more severe decline associated with AD. In addition, 
we provide a set of specific metabolic alterations that may under-
lie these processes. Thus, these results provide further support that 
fisetin or a derivative (47) might be beneficial for the treatment of 
age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.
Figure 5. Global metabolomic profiling of plasma and cortex demonstrate 
that alterations in biological pathways between young SAMP8 and old 
SAMP8 mice are partially rescued by fisetin. Plasma and cortex biochemicals 
found significantly modified. Boxes are: white = young; black = old; gray = 
old + fisetin. Welch’s two-sample t test was used to identify biochemicals 
that differed significantly between experimental groups (n = 5/group). *p 
< .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001. SAMP8 = senescence-accelerated prone 8.
