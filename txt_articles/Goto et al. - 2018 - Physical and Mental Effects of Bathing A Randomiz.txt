Showering is the most common form of bathing worldwide. Whole-body immersion bathing in warm water (∼40∘C) is common
in Japan and exerts sufficient hyperthermic action to induce vasodilatation and increase blood flow, supplying more oxygen and
nutrients to the periphery. Cross-sectional studies report better subjective health status with an immersion bathing habit. This
randomized controlled trial compared the effects on health of immersion bathing and shower bathing in 38 participants who
received 2-week intervention of immersion bathing in warm water (40∘C) for 10 min (bathing intervention) followed by 2-week
shower bathing without immersion (showering intervention) or vice versa (n = 19 each group). Visual analog scale scores were
significantly better for fatigue, stress, pain, and smile and tended to be better for self-reported heath and skin condition after bathing
intervention than after showering intervention. The SF-8 Health Survey showed significantly better general health, mental health,
role emotional, and social functioning scores. Profile of Mood State scores were lower for stress, tension-anxiety, anger-hostility,
and depression-dejection. Immersion bathing, but not shower bathing, exerts hyperthermic action that induces increased blood
flow and metabolic waste elimination, which may afford physical refreshment. Immersion bathing should improve both physical
and emotional aspects of quality of life.
1. Introduction
Lifestyles can vary widely, and several lifestyle factors such as
diet, exercise, sleep, alcohol consumption, and smoking are
associated with health and survival [1–4]. Another aspect of
lifestyle that varies is bathing, several forms of which include
bathing in a conventional shower, steam shower, sauna, or
bathtub. Bathing in a shower is the most common form of
bathing. In Japan, immersion of the whole body in warm
water (around 40∘C) is a common habit [5, 6]. It is known that
the most beneficial effect of so-called immersion bathing is
vasodilation induced by hyperthermic action, which results
in systemic elevation of the supply of oxygen and nutrients
to the periphery and increased elimination of carbon dioxide
and metabolic waste materials [7–10].
A survey of bathing practices in Japan revealed that
80% of participants enjoyed bathing (either in a bathtub or
shower) and more than 80% reported sensations or feelings of
warmth, relaxation, relief from fatigue, and refreshment after
immersion bathing [11]. The weekly frequency of bathing
varies by season: in summer, shower bathing occurs, on
average 4.4 times per week versus immersion bathing at 3.4
times (at 39.4 ± 1.4∘C for 9.4 ± 8.8 min); in winter, immersion
bathing occurs, on average, 5.0 times per week (at 41.2 ±
1.2∘C for 12.9 ± 9.7 min) and shower bathing at 1.6 times
[12].
Our previous cross-sectional studies found good sub-
jective health status, sufficient sleep and rest, low levels of
stress, and high subjective happiness in individuals who had
a habit of bathing in hot water everyday [13, 14]. However, the
benefits of certain periods of bathing interventions have not
been reported.
This randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of
a total of 4 weeks of intervention consisting of 2 weeks of
immersion bathing intervention (bathing intervention) and
2 weeks of shower bathing without immersion intervention

(showering intervention) in order to compare the physical
and mental effects between the two interventions.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Sample Preparation. Subjects were 38 healthy adults
(26 women, 12 men; mean age, 45.7 years, SD = 8.4). We
recruited the subjects from a Japanese portal site named
KARADAKARA, which was an Internet circle where people
are interested in health consisting of about 250 thousand
people. The Ethics Committee of Japan Health & Research
Institute approved the study protocol, and all work was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
(1964). Written informed consent was obtained from each
subject before commencing the study. This study is registered
in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000006618).
This intervention study was conducted from October
30 to November 26, 2011, to investigate the two bathing
methods of immersion bath in hot water (40∘C) for 10 min
(bathing) and showering without immersion (showering).
Subjects were randomized to the groups, and the effects of
bathing for 2 weeks and showering for 2 weeks continuously
were compared using a cross-over method. No washout was
performed.
2.2. Assessment Measures. Perceived health is associated with
mortality [15], so self-reported health status (health, skin
condition, pain, fatigue, stress, and smile in the mirror) was
assessed using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS; extremely
bad 0 [left] to extremely good 100 [right]) after bathing
every day during the intervention periods. To assess health
and mood states during each intervention period, partici-
pants retrospectively completed the Japanese versions of the
8-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-8) and a short form of
the Profile of Mood States (POMS), respectively, after each
2-week intervention period. The SF-8 [16] uses single-item
scales to assess 8 items: general health, physical functioning,
role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain,
vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, mental health,
and role limitations due to emotional problems. Physical
and Mental Component Summary scores are also calculated.
The POMS [17] is used worldwide for the assessment of
mood states, measuring the constructs of tension-anxiety,
depression-dejection, anger-hostility, fatigue, confusion, and
vigor.
2.3. Statistical Analysis. The paired t-test was used to com-
pare subjective health status before and after bathing every
day and between the 2-week bathing intervention and the 2-
week showering intervention periods. The statistical package
SPSS 19.0J (IBM, Tokyo, Japan) was used for analysis.
3. Results
Subjects of the analysis were 33 of the 38 participants who
remained in good health during the 4-week intervention
study and completed all measurement items without missing
data. Five subjects excluded from this study could not
continue this bathing method because of their private matter
which is not a health problem.
3.1. Self-Reported Health Status. Tables 1 and 2 show the VAS
scores for self-reported health status every day before and
after the bathing and showering interventions, respectively.
Significant improvements were observed for all assessed
items after each intervention.

Table 3 shows the results for self-reported health status
during each intervention completed retrospectively after each
intervention period. VAS scores were higher for self-reported
health and skin condition (p < 0.10) and significantly higher
for smile (p < 0.05) during bathing intervention than during
showering intervention. In addition, fatigue, stress, and pain
scores were significantly lower during bathing intervention
than during showering intervention (p < 0.05).
3.2. Health-Related Quality of Life Assessment. Table 4 shows
the individual scores for the 8 items on the SF-8 and the
Physical and Mental Component Summary scores indicating
health status during each 2-week intervention, as retro-
spectively self-reported after completing each intervention.
General health, social functioning, mental health, and Mental
Component Summary scores were significantly higher dur-
ing bathing intervention than during showering intervention
(p < 0.05). There were no differences in role physical,
physical functioning, bodily pain, role emotional, or Mental
Component Summary scores.
3.3. Mood States. Table 5 shows mood states assessed after
the 2-week bathing intervention and the 2-week showering
intervention, measured using the 6-item POMS. Scores were
significantly lower for tension-anxiety, depression-dejection,
and anger-hostility during bathing intervention than during
showering intervention (p < 0.05). There were no significant
differences in fatigue, confusion, or vigor.
4. Discussion
This randomized controlled trial comparing the physical and
mental effects of 2 weeks of bathing intervention and 2 weeks
of showering intervention (without immersion) showed that
 4
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
bathing intervention was more beneficial than showering
intervention. The sample size is small, which means this result
has limited power. However this is a cross-over study, so that
we think the result which we showed is a casual relationship.
Self-assessment of health status before and after inter-
vention every day showed health improvement after both
bathing and showering interventions, although the degree of
improvement was larger after the former than after the latter.
This result suggests that either intervention improves physical
and mental condition. Bodily cleanliness and a feeling of
refreshment are benefits offered by bathing and showering.
Bathing intervention did, however, show better subjective
health status (VAS scores) than showering intervention.
Our previous cross-sectional studies [13, 14] suggested
that people who had a habit of bathing in hot water have good
subjective health status, sufficient sleep and rest, low levels of
stress, and high subjective happiness. The results of this study
support that the psychological benefits of bathing are a real
causal relationship.
During bathing, several actions unique to bathing will
be exerted on the body, including hyperthermic action,
hydrostatic pressure, buoyancy, and viscosity of water.
The most important of these is hyperthermic action,
which warms the blood in superficial vessels, thereby increas-
ing the deep body temperature through circulation. With
an increase in body temperature, heat-sensitive neurons
are excited while cold-sensitive neurons are inhibited in
the thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus, causing
inhibition of the sympathetic nerves and stimulation of
the parasympathetic nerves, leading to vasodilatation and
induced perspiration to decrease the body temperature. Heart
rate will rise by 40% to 50%, and peripheral pO2 will increase
while pCO2 will decrease, thereby stimulating metabolism
and inducing elimination of metabolic waste materials, which
in turn refreshes the body [7–10]. In terms of hydrostatic
pressure, it induces venous flow, thereby increasing cardiac
output and improving metabolism. Also, a habit of immer-
sion bathing in hot water was shown to be associated with
strengthened immune function [18, 19].
A bathing study using patients with cardiovascular dis-
eases showed the improvement of hemodynamics by heating
effect [20]. On the other hand, for aged generation especially
patients for cardiovascular diseases, full body immersion
would be unbeneficial because hydrostatic pressure causes
venous return load.
This study showed better self-assessment results for
fatigue, subjective health, skin condition, and smile as well
as a better SF-8 Physical Component Summary score during
the intervention with daily immersion bathing, suggesting
systemic improvement of metabolism by taking an immer-
sion bath. Furthermore, hyperthermic action is expected to
systemically relax the muscles, soften collagen in ligaments
and articular capsules, and improve musculoskeletal func-
tion. The pain-relieving effect of bathing [21] may explain
the reduction in self-rated pain reported by subjects in the
present study. Lastly, the downward force of gravity is reduced
by buoyancy during bathing, which may in turn lead to
the improvements seen in the POMS constructs of tension-
anxiety, depression-dejection, and anger-hostility, suggesting
positive effects of stress relief, refreshment, and relaxation
from immersion bathing.
The limitations of this study are as follows. This trial
was conducted in the fall (October-November), and seasonal
differences in bathing habit (e.g., autumn versus summer
or winter) were not taken into account. Also, the timing of
body immersion and the temperature of water in the bathtub
were not strictly defined. Interventional studies using tightly
controlled conditions will provide insight that is useful for
health promotion. In addition, there may be a bias caused by
the fact that Japanese likes bathing in general. Even though we
think that heating effect of bathing does not differ depending
on races, if we do the same intervention study with people
in Europe, the result may be changed because the favor
regarding bathing may be different between Japanese and
people in other countries
5. Conclusions
Routine immersion bathing appeared more beneficial to
mental and physical health than routine shower bathing
without immersion. Further interventional studies that con-
sider seasonal factors and physiological factors in relation
to effective bathing temperature and timing are anticipated
to show the effect of immersion bathing and clarify the
beneficial effects on health.
