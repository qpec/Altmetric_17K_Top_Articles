OBJECTIVE
To identify and define clinically meaningful type 1 diabetes outcomes beyond he-
moglobin A1c (HbA1c) based upon a review of the evidence, consensus from clinical
experts, and input from researchers, people with type 1 diabetes, and industry.
Priority outcomes include hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, time in range, diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA), and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). While priority outcomes
for type 1 and type 2 diabetes may overlap, type 1 diabetes was the focus of this
work.
RESEARCH AND METHODS
A Steering Committeedcomprising representatives from the American Association
of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, the
American Diabetes Association, the Endocrine Society, JDRF International, The Leona M.
and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, and the
T1D Exchangedwas the decision-making body for the Type 1 Diabetes Outcomes
Program. Their work was informed by input from researchers, industry, and people
with diabetes through Advisory Committees representing each stakeholder group.
Stakeholder surveys were used to identify priority outcomes. The outcomes priori-
tized in the surveys were hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, time in range, DKA, and
PROs. To develop consensus on the definitions of these outcomes, the Steering
Committee relied on published evidence, their clinical expertise, and feedback from
the Advisory Committees.

CGM AND RISK OF HYPOGLYCEMIA
 RESULTS
The Steering Committee developed defi-
nitions for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia,
time in range, and DKA in type 1 diabetes.
The definitions reflect their assessment
of the outcome’s short- and long-term
clinical impact on people with type 1 di-
abetes. Knowledge gaps to be addressed
by future research were identified. The
Steering Committee discussed PROs and
concluded that further type 1 diabetes–
specific development is needed.
CONCLUSIONS
The Steering Committee recommends
use of the defined clinically meaningful
outcomes beyond HbA1c in the research,
development, and evaluation of type 1
diabetes therapies.
Type 1 diabetes is a life-threatening, au-
toimmune disease that strikes children
and adults and can be fatal. People with
type 1 diabetes have to test their blood
glucose multiple times each day and dose
insulin via injections or an infusion pump
24 h a day every day. Too much insulin
can result in hypoglycemia, seizures,
coma, or death. Hyperglycemia over time
leads to kidney, heart, nerve, and eye
damage. Even with diligent monitoring,
the majority of people with type 1 diabe-
tes do not achieve recommended target
glucose levels. In the U.S., approximately
one in five children and one in three adults
meet hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets and
the average patient spends 7 h a day hy-
perglycemic and over 90 min hypoglyce-
mic (1–3). The disease burden of type 1
diabetes can negatively impact quality of
life, including finances and careers. In ad-
dition, the stress on and amount of time
required of caregivers, including parents
and children caring for aging parents liv-
ing with type 1 diabetes, also burdens the
entire family. There remains significant
room for further improvement in the
therapies and technologies designed to
treat and assist in the management of this
disease and prevent its life-threatening
complications.
HbA1c is a well-accepted surrogate out-
come measure for evaluating the efficacy
of diabetes therapies and technologies in
clinical practice as well as in research
(4–6). For the purposes of this article,
the Steering Committee is using the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention’s
definition of population health outcomes,
defined as a population’s dynamic state
of physical, mental, and social well-being
(7). While HbA1c is used as a primary out-
come to assess glycemic control and as a
surrogate for risk of developing complica-
tions, it has limitations. As a measure of
mean blood glucose over 2 or 3 months,
HbA1c does not capture short-term va-
riations in blood glucose or exposure to
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in indi-
viduals with type 1 diabetes; HbA1c also
does not capture the impact of blood glu-
cose variations on individuals’ quality of
life. Recent advances in type 1 diabetes
technologies have made it feasible to as-
sess the efficacy of therapies and technol-
ogies using a set of outcomes beyond
HbA1c and to expand definitions of out-
comes such as hypoglycemia. While defi-
nitions for hypoglycemia in clinical care
exist, they have not been standardized
among organizations and there is incon-
sistency in the definitions used in differ-
ent research studies. The lack of standard
definitions impedes and can confuse their
use in clinical practice, impedes devel-
opment processes for new therapies,
makes comparison of studies in the litera-
ture challenging, and may lead to regula-
tory and reimbursement decisions that
fail to meet the needs of people with
diabetes.
To address this vital issue, the type 1
diabetes–stakeholdercommunitylaunched
the Type 1 Diabetes Outcomes Program
to develop consensus definitions for a set
of priority outcomes for type 1 diabetes. A
Steering Committeedcomprising repre-
sentatives from the American Association
of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the
American Association of Diabetes Educa-
tors (AADE), the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation(ADA), the EndocrineSociety,JDRF
International, The Leona M. and Harry B.
Helmsley Charitable Trust, the Pedi-
atric Endocrine Society (PES), and the
T1D Exchangedwas the decision-making
body for the Type 1 Diabetes Outcomes
Program. The work of the Steering Com-
mittee was informed by diabetes re-
searchers, industry, and people with
diabetes through Advisory Committees
representing each stakeholder group
(Supplementary Data). The Steering Com-
mittee met for distinct in-person meet-
ings in May and August 2016 to review
the existing evidence and discuss and
come to consensus on definitions for
each priority outcome. Teleconferences
and surveys of Advisory Committee mem-
bers also informed discussions of outcome
definitions. JDRF paid the expenses for this
group, including teleconferences, travel
expenses, and consulting services to facil-
itate group discussion, funded in part by a
grant from The Leona M. and Harry B.
Helmsley Charitable Trust. A draft consen-
sus statement was posted on JDRF’s web-
site for 30 days in March 2017 to allow for
public comments.
The outcomes prioritized under the
program include hypoglycemia, hypergly-
cemia, time in range, diabetic ketoacido-
sis (DKA), and patient-reported outcomes
(PROs). The Steering Committee, with in-
put from the Advisory Committees, came
to consensus on standardized definitions
for each outcome based on published ev-
idence and their expert opinion (or, in the
caseofPROs,aconsensusthatfurthertype
1 diabetes–specific PRO development
was needed). The focus for this program
was type 1 diabetes, although the litera-
ture reviewed included data from people
without diabetes and with type 2 diabe-
tes to support the consensus statement.
A parallel article published in this issue of
Diabetes Care focuses more broadly on di-
abetes, and it is notable that the definitions
reached are the same for both groups (8).
The immediate goal of the Type 1 Di-
abetes OutcomesProgram wastoidentify
and provide standardized definitions for
an expanded set of clinical outcomes for
research aimed at the development and
evaluation of new diabetes therapies and
technologies. It is not our expectation for
any of the outcomes defined in this doc-
ument to replace HbA1c, as it remains an
important outcome measure, but rather
that they supplement its utility and allow
for the capture of a more comprehensive
understanding of how interventions might
influence people with diabetes. The goal of
the program is to ensure that defined out-
comes are included as primary and second-
ary end points in type 1 diabetes research,
development, and evaluation for future
therapies.

HYPOGLYCEMIA
Hypoglycemia is a significantdand po-
tentially fataldcomplication of type 1 di-
abetes management and has been found
to be a barrier to achieving glycemic goals
(9). Repeated exposure to severe hy-
poglycemic events has been associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular
events and all-cause mortality in people
with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (10,11). Hy-
poglycemia can also be fatal, and severe
hypoglycemic events have been associ-
ated with increased mortality (12–14). In
addition to the physical aspects of hypo-
glycemia, it can also have negative conse-
quences on emotional status and quality
of life.
While there is some variability in how
and when individuals manifest symptoms
of hypoglycemia, beginning at blood
glucose levels ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L)
(which is at the low end of the typical
postabsorptive plasma glucose range),
the body begins to increase its secretion
of counterregulatory hormones includ-
ing glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and
growth hormone. The release of these
hormones can cause moderate auto-
nomic effects, including but not limited
to shaking, palpitations, sweating, and
hunger (15). Individuals without diabetes
do not typically experience dangerously
low blood glucose levels because of coun-
terregulatory hormonal regulation of gly-
cemia (16). However, in individuals with
type 1diabetes, there is often a deficiency
of the counterregulatory response, hin-
dering their ability to avoid hypoglycemic
events. Moreover, as people with diabe-
tes experience an increased number of
episodes of hypoglycemia, the risk of hy-
poglycemia unawareness, impaired glu-
cose counterregulation (for example, in
hypoglycemia-associated autonomic fail-
ure [17]), and level 2 and level 3 hypogly-
cemia (see DEFINITION under HYPOGLYCEMIA) all
increase (18). Therefore, it is important to
recognize and treat all hypoglycemic
events in people with type 1 diabetes,
particularly in populations (children, the
elderly) that may not have the ability to
recognize and self-treat hypoglycemia.
More notable clinical symptoms begin
at blood glucose levels ,54 mg/dL
(3.0 mmol/L) (19,20). As the body’s pri-
mary utilizer of glucose, the brain is par-
ticularly sensitive to decreases in blood
glucose concentrations. Both experimen-
tal and clinical evidence has shown that,
at these levels, neurogenic and neurogly-
copenic symptoms including impairments
in reaction times, information processing,
psychomotor function, and executive
function begin to emerge. These neuro-
logical symptoms correlate to altered
brain activity in multiple brain areas in-
cluding the prefrontal cortex and medial
temporal lobe (21–24). At these levels,
individuals may experience confusion,
dizziness, blurred or double vision, trem-
ors, and tingling sensations (25). Hypogly-
cemia at this glycemic level may also
increase proinflammatory and prothrom-
botic markers (26). Left untreated, these
symptoms can become severe to the
point that an individual will require assis-
tance from others to move or function.
Prolonged untreated hypoglycemia that
continues to drop below 50 mg/dL
(2.8 mmol/L) increases the risk of sei-
zures, coma, and death (27,28). Hypogly-
cemia that affects cognition and stamina
may also increase the risk of accidents
and falls, which is a particular concern
for older adults with diabetes (29,30).
The glycemic thresholds at which these
symptoms occur, as well as the severity
with which they manifest themselves,
may vary in individuals with type 1 diabe-
tes depending on the number of hypogly-
cemic episodes they have experienced
(31–33). Counterregulatory physiological
responses may evolve in patients with
type 1 diabetes who endure repeated hy-
poglycemia over time (34,35).
Definition
The Steering Committee defined three
levels of hypoglycemia, as shown in Table
2. These levels are slight modifications to
and will update the recently published
ADA/EASD position statement (36).
Level 1
Level 1 hypoglycemia is defined as a
measurable glucose concentration ,70
mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) but $54 mg/dL
(3.0 mmol/L) that can alert a person to
take action. A blood glucose concentra-
tion of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) has been
recognized as a marker of physiological
hypoglycemia in humans, as it approxi-
mates the glycemic threshold for neuro-
endocrine responses to falling glucose
levels in individuals without diabetes. As
such, blood glucose in individuals without
diabetes is generally 70–100 mg/dL (3.9–
5.6 mmol/L) upon waking and 70–
140 mg/dL (3.9–7.8 mmol/L) after meals,
and any excursions beyond those levels
are typically countered with physiological
controls (16,37). However, individuals
with diabetes who have impaired or al-
tered counterregulatory hormonal and
neurological responses do not have the
same internal regulation as individuals
withoutdiabetes toavoid droppingbelow
70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and becoming
hypoglycemic. Recurrent episodes of hy-
poglycemia lead to increased hypoglyce-
mia unawareness, which can become
dangerous as individuals cease to expe-
rience symptoms of hypoglycemia, allow-
ing their blood glucose levels to continue
falling. Therefore, glucose levels ,70
mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) are clinically impor-
tant, independent of the severity of acute
symptoms.

 Level 2
Level 2 hypoglycemia is defined as a mea-
surable glucose concentration ,54 mg/dL
(3.0 mmol/L) that needs immediate ac-
tion. At ;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L), neuro-
genic and neuroglycopenic hypoglycemic
symptomsbegintooccur,ultimatelylead-
ing to brain dysfunction at levels ,50
mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) (19,20).Neuroglyco-
penic symptomsdincluding behavioral
changes, visual changes, seizure, and loss
of consciousnessdare the result of cen-
tral nervous system neuronal glucose
deprivation (21–23).
Level 3
Level 3 hypoglycemia is defined as a
severe event characterized by altered
mental and/or physical status requiring
assistance. Severe hypoglycemia captures
events during which the symptoms asso-
ciated with hypoglycemia impact a pa-
tient to such a degree that the patient
requires assistance from others (27,28).
Level 3 hypoglycemia is not mutually ex-
clusive from level 1 or level 2. The Steer-
ing Committee considered it important to
classify “altered mental and/or physical
status requiring assistance” as its own
category of hypoglycemia given that
thereareindividualswho areable tofunc-
tion independently at a blood glucose
,54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) and therefore
should not be grouped into the same cat-
egory as those individuals who require
third-party assistance. It is also important
to include language on the need for third-
party assistance as part of the definition
for hypoglycemia, but the term “assis-
tance” is subjective and needs to be clear
to allow for evaluation. Including an “al-
tered mental and/or physical status re-
quiring assistance” clarifies the state
that the individual is in when necessitat-
ing help to correct a low blood glucose
value.
In addition to the glucose levels and
signs included in the definitions, other
specific signs or symptoms of hypoglyce-
mia are important for consideration of
individuals with hypoglycemia unaware-
ness and variations in the presentation
of hypoglycemia among different demo-
graphics. Hypoglycemia that sets in rela-
tively rapidly, such as in the case of a
significant insulin overdose, may induce
level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia with little
warning (38).
Gaps in Evidence and Measurement
Currently, there is noconsistentapproach
to collecting glucose data that would al-
low for the appropriate measurement of
hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood
glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) are useful, but not
perfect, and their results provide distinct
information; one is a point-in-time mea-
surement and the other is a continuous
view into changes in glucose levels. Fur-
ther, CGM can be useful for capturing hy-
poglycemia missed by SMBG, especially
at night, and also for capturing time spent
in hypoglycemia. The differences in the
methodology and timing used for obtain-
ingblood glucosereadings area challenge
for interpreting clinical trial and real-
world patient data. Given the differences
in the outputs from SMBG and CGM,
researchers and clinicians need to deter-
mine how the results are interpreted and
when the blood glucose level requires a
corrective action. The advent of addi-
tional information, including trending in-
dicators on CGM devices (39), increases
decision-making, as one must decide at
what point to correct versus waiting for a
low blood glucose to potentially increase.
Additionally, there is no consensus on how
long an individual must remain at a partic-
ularbloodglucoseleveltobeconsideredin
the level 1 or level 2 hypoglycemic range
(8). Much of the evidence on hypoglyce-
mia to date has been obtained through
conventional monitoring; the increased
use of CGM and other technologies may
provide more insights on these questions.
Therefore, new surveillance methods
that provide consistent ways of reporting
hypoglycemia should be developed to
ensure adequate assessment of the im-
pact of any intervention to prevent and
treat the short-term effects of hypoglyce-
mia, including the potential for death.
More information on the impact of level
1 and level 2 hypoglycemiadboth physio-
logically and with regard to impairment in
howpatientsfeelandfunctiondis needed.
Additionally, more work can be done on
the links between level 1 and level 2 hypo-
glycemiato long-termoutcomes,aswellas
the underlying factors of hypoglycemia-
associated autonomic failure and other
changes to physiological responses to re-
peated hypoglycemia over time.
HYPERGLYCEMIA
The Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial (DCCT) proved that chronic hypergly-
cemia, as measured by a high HbA1c, is a
risk factor for microvascular complica-
tions, including retinopathy, nephropa-
thy, and neuropathy (40). The DCCT
follow-up studydEpidemiology of Diabe-
tes Interventions and Complications
(EDIC)dconfirmed the findings of the
DCCT and showed that chronic hypergly-
cemia also increases risk of nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, and death from
cardiovascular disease (41). Other epi-
demiological evidence indicates that
elevated blood glucose increases cardio-
vascular risk even in individuals without
diabetes (42). The data regarding the ef-
fects of chronic hyperglycemia on long-
term outcomes is conclusive, indicating
that chronic hyperglycemia is a major
contributor to morbidity and mortality
in type 1 diabetes (41,43–45). The DCCT
and subsequent studies have shown that
intensive glucose management early in
the life of people with type 1 diabetes
can have long-lasting beneficial outcomes
(46).
Although the correlation between
long-term poor glucose control and
type 1 diabetes complications is well es-
tablished, the impact of short-term hy-
perglycemia is not as well understood.
However, hyperglycemia has been shown
to have physiological effects and in an
acute-care setting is linked to morbidity
and mortality in people with and without
diabetes. Short-term hyperglycemia, re-
gardless of diabetes diagnosis, has been
shown to reduce survival rates among
patients admitted to the hospital with
stroke or myocardial infarction (47,48).
In addition to increasing mortality,
short-term hyperglycemia is correlated

 with stroke severity and poststroke dis-
ability (49,50).
The effects of short-term hyperglyce-
mia have also been observed in nonacute
settings. Evidence indicates that hyper-
glycemia alters retinal cell firing through
sensitization in patients with type 1 dia-
betes (51). This finding is consistent with
similar findingsshowingincreased oxygen
consumption and blood flow in the retina
during hyperglycemia. Because retinal
cells absorb glucose through an insulin-
independent process, they respond more
stronglytoincreasesinglucoseintheblood
than other cells in patients with type 1 di-
abetes. The effects of acute hyperglycemia
on retinal response may underlie part of
the development of retinopathy known
to be a long-term complication of type 1
diabetes.
Reports of glucose profiles in individu-
als without diabetes may provide infor-
mation to help define normal glucose
ranges. For healthy individuals, data indi-
cate that peak postmeal glucose values
generally do not exceed 140 mg/dL (7.8
mmol/L) (52). However, other evidence
indicates that the majority of individuals
without diabetes have blood glucose val-
ues that exceed 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
every day (53,54). In one study, 93% of
healthy participants spent time above
140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) with median
time above 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) at
26 min (range 0 min to 6 h 52 min) per
day (53). This same study also found that
nearly 10% of individuals without diabe-
tes had blood glucose values that reach
200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during the day,
which, by some standards, would be con-
sideredindicativeofdiabetes. Other stud-
ies suggest similar glucose patterns for
individuals with normal glucose toler-
ance. A study in 32 individuals with con-
firmed normal glucose tolerance found
that seven participants (22%) reached glu-
cose concentrations .200 mg/dL (11.1
mmol/L) during an average of 28 days
of CGM and that participants spent on
average 42 min/day at glucose concen-
trations .140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) (54).
In contrast, glucose profiles forindividuals
with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes
demonstrated that glucose concentra-
tions were .140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
during ;60% of the total day or .180
mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) during ;30% of
the total day (52).
Pre- and postmeal glucose targets, ap-
proximating glycemic profiles of individuals
without diabetes, are used in clinical prac-
tice to try to reduce exposure to hypergly-
cemia. Although specific goals are expected
to vary based on individual needs, the ADA
guidelines for individuals with diabetes
(type 1 and type 2) indicate that premeal
blood glucose should be between 80
and 130 mg/dL (4.4 and 7.2 mmol/L)
and that peak postprandial glucose should
be ,180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) (55). AACE
guidelines for people with diabetes (type
1 and type 2) suggest that to achieve an
HbA1c of #6.5% (48 mmol/mol), premeal
blood glucose may need to be ,110
mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) and 2-h postmeal
blood glucose may need to be ,140 mg/dL
(7.8 mmol/L) (56,57). These levels repre-
sent ideal targets within a near-normal
range, as a patient with diabetes may
have large fluctuations in glucose levels
in real time. All guidelines discuss the
need to individualize therapy and cre-
ate targets that are appropriate for each
patient.
Definition
The Steering Committee defines hyper-
glycemia for individuals with type 1 dia-
betes as the following:
c Level 1delevated glucose: glucose
.180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) and glucose
#250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L)
c Level 2dvery elevated glucose: glu-
cose .250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L)
Level 1
Elevated glucose is defined as a glucose
concentration .180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
but #250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L). In clini-
cal practice, measures of hyperglycemia
differ based on time of day (e.g., pre- vs.
postmeal). This program, however, fo-
cused on defining outcomes for use in
product development that are universally
applicable. Glucose profiles and post-
prandial blood glucose data for indivi-
duals without diabetes suggest that 140
mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is the appropriate
threshold for defining hyperglycemia.
However, data demonstrate that the ma-
jority of individuals without diabetes ex-
ceed this threshold every day. Moreover,
people with diabetes spend .60% of
their day above this threshold, which sug-
gests that 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is too
low of a threshold for measuring hyper-
glycemia inindividuals withdiabetes. Cur-
rent clinical guidelines for people with
diabetes indicate that peak prandial
glucose should not exceed 180 mg/dL
(10.0 mmol/L). As such, the Steering Com-
mittee identified 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
as the initial threshold defining elevated
glucose.
Level 2
Very elevated glucose is defined as a glu-
cose concentration .250 mg/dL (13.9
mmol/L). Evidence examining the impact
of hyperglycemia does not examine the
incremental effects of increasing blood
glucose. However, blood glucose values
exceeding 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) in-
creasetheriskforDKA(58),and HbA1c read-
ings at that level have been associated
with a high likelihood of complications.
Although hyperglycemia is often recog-
nized at different levels depending on a
number of circumstances, the above def-
inition allows for the assessment of the
ability of therapies and technologies to
provide better glucose outcomes and to
limitexposure tolevel1 and level 2 hyper-
glycemic blood glucose values. The defi-
nition is meant to apply generally to
people with type 1 diabetes at any given
moment of the day. Further differentia-
ting between blood glucose values
.250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) is less likely
to be clinically meaningful except in in-
stances of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
syndrome. For this reason, hyperglyce-
mia is best defined with a two-category
classification.
Gaps in Evidence and Measurement
Further research is needed to better un-
derstand the effects of individual episodes
of hyperglycemia as opposed to sustained
hyperglycemia over time. More research
would be helpful for understanding the
connections between hyperglycemia and
macrovascular disease and other chronic
complications, including the role of genetic
factors and a patient’s ability to recognize
when hyperglycemia is occurring. This re-
search is complicated by the fact that
many patients with type 1 diabetes natu-
rally have sustained hyperglycemia; CGM
may benefit from such research. Also,
more work can be done to elucidate any
genetic variables that would affect phys-
iological responses to hyperglycemia.
PROs that address the impactofhypergly-
cemia for patients are also needed, as will
be discussed in a later section.
TIME IN RANGE
An individual whose blood glucose levels
rarely extend beyond the thresholds
1626

 defined for hypo- and hyperglycemia is
less likely to be subject to the short-
term or long-term effects experienced
by those with frequent excursions be-
yond one or both thresholds. It is also
evident that if the intent of a given inter-
vention is to safely manage blood glucose
but the intervention does not reliably
maintain blood glucose within safe levels,
then the intervention should not be con-
sidered effective.
The time in range outcome is distin-
guished from traditional HbA1c testing in
several ways (4,59). Time in range cap-
tures fluctuations in glucose levels contin-
uously, whereas HbA1c testing is done at
static points in time, usually months apart
(60). Furthermore, time in range is more
specific and sensitive than traditional
HbA1c testing; for example, a treatment
that addressesacute instancesofhypo-or
hyperglycemia may be detected in a time
in range assessment but not necessarily
in an HbA1c assessment. As a percentage,
time in range is also more likely to be
comparable across patients than HbA1c
values, which are more likely to have
patient-specific variations in significance
(61). Finally, time in range may be more
likely than HbA1c levels to correlate with
PROs, such as quality of life, because
the outcome is more representative of the
whole patient experience (62). Table 3
illustrates how the concept of time in
range differs from current HbA1c testing.
Nevertheless, evidence describing the
negative effects of hypo- and hyperglyce-
mia does not directly demonstrate the
positive effects of maintaining blood glu-
cose between those two thresholds. For
example, evidence may point to health
outcomes being optimal if time in range
is defined at thresholds that are narrower
than the hypo- andhyperglycemiathresh-
olds. Also, variation in what is considered
“normal” glucose fluctuations across pop-
ulations, as well as what is realistically
achievable for people with type 1 diabetes,
must be taken into account so as not to
makethetargetrangedefinitiontoorestric-
tive.Inaddition,asdiscussedin HYPERGLYCEMIA,
clinical guidelines include pre- and post-
meal glucose targets underscoringthe im-
portance of a target range.
At least one study has demonstrated
the direct clinical relevance of time in
range correlating to positive overall out-
comes. This prospective inpatient study
evaluated 227 patients (100 with type 2
diabetes and 127 without diabetes) post–
cardiac surgery to assess glucose control.
Forthepurposesofthisstudy,timeinrange
was defined as being time in the range of
108–146 mg/dL (6.0–8.1 mmol/L). Pa-
tients received insulin to target glucose
concentrations within that range. The
results of the study showed that post–
cardiac surgery patients with 80% of
time within a range of 108–146 mg/dL
(6.0–8.1 mmol/L) had better outcomes,
with or without diabetes, compared with
patients with less than 80%. While the fac-
tors influencing inpatient recovery are
varied, the study suggests a correlation be-
tween positive outcomes and time in range
(63). Other research has indicated a link
between ahigh percentage oftime in range
with recovery of glucose counterregulation
and hypoglycemia symptom recognition in
patients with type 1 diabetes following in-
trahepatic islet transplantation (64).
Morecommonly,timeinrangehasbeen
adopted by researchers evaluating the pre-
cision and effectiveness of emerging glu-
cose monitoring and automated insulin
delivery technologies. None of these stud-
ies relate time in range to any long-termdi-
abetes outcomes, as these studies are of
shortduration.Inoneexample,researchers
compared a wearable, bihormonal, au-
tomated device to an insulin pump for
5 days over a 96-h period in 52 adults
and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Re-
searchers measured the percent time in
range by the hour, and the desired glu-
cose range was defined as 70–180 mg/dL
(3.9–10.0 mmol/L). They demonstrated
that the bihormonal device was able to
keep patients within a range of 70–
180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) for more
time than the insulin pump, concluding
that this device was a more effective
means of managing blood glucose (65).
Definition
The Steering Committee defines time in
range for individuals with type 1 diabetes
as the following:
c Percentage of readings in the range of
70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) per
unit of time
The Steering Committee considered it
important to keep the time in range def-
inition wide in order to accommodate
variations across the population with
type 1 diabetesdincluding different age-
groupsdbut limited enough to preclude
the possibility of negative outcomes. The
upper and lower bounds of the time in
range definition are consistent with the
definitions for hypo- and hyperglycemia
defined above. For individuals without
type 1 diabetes, 70–140 mg/dL (3.9–7.8
mmol/L) represents a normal glycemic
range (66). However, spending most of
the day in this range is not generally
achievable for people with type 1 diabe-
tes because they do not have physiologi-
cal insulin secretion (67). The current
postprandialbloodglucosetargetforpeo-
ple with type 1 diabetes is 180 mg/dL
(10.0 mmol/L), and, as such, an upper limit
of 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) allows the
definition to be applied across the broad
population with type 1 diabetes (55).
The Steering Committee noted that, to
date, the use of time in range has been to
test the effectiveness of technologies de-
signed to monitor blood glucose levels in
real time and maintain glucose control. In
order to generate the data necessary to
measuretimeinrange,CGMorsimilartech-
nologies must be used. Use of CGM among
the population with type 1 diabetes has
been suggested to be ;11% in some pop-
ulations and increasing in adoption rate
(1). The Steering Committee felt that
these technologies were at a point of de-
velopmentin which they could andshould
be used safely and effectively to capture
time in range data.
Gaps in Evidence and Measurement
To date, there is limited research correlat-
ing time in range with positive short-term

 and long-term type 1 diabetes outcomes,
as opposed to the extensive research dem-
onstrating the negative consequences of
excursions into hyper- or hypoglycemia.
More substantial evidence demonstrating
a correlation or a direct causative relation-
ship between time in range for patients
with type 1 diabetes and positive health
outcomes is needed.
Variations across the literature that
examined time in range included differ-
ences in glycemic variability, dietary
factors, sample sizes, and population de-
mographics that will need to be recon-
ciled as further research develops. A
deficiency in evidence for the pediatric
population was noted (67,68). Members
of the committee noted that more evi-
dence could be gathered on the experi-
ence of individuals with type 1 diabetes
both in and out of glycemic range, which
would potentially be captured in a PRO,
as will be described later in this article.
DKA
DKA is often associated with hyperglyce-
mia. In most cases, in an individual with
diabetes, the cause of hyperglycemia is
also the cause of DKA, although the two
conditions are distinct. DKA develops
when a lack of glucose in cells prompts
the body to begin breaking down fatty
acid reserves. This increases the levels
of ketones in the body (ketosis) and
causes a drop in blood pH (acidosis). At
its most severe, DKA can cause cerebral
edema, acute respiratory distress, throm-
boembolism, coma, and death (69,70).
ThedetailsofhowDKAinducesnear-term
physiological effects, as well as how it may
potentiallycontributetolong-termcomplica-
tions, continue to be researched. Evidence
suggests that DKA causes acute negative ef-
fects on the myocardium in adults and chil-
dren, as indicated by increases of troponin I
concentrations under DKA conditions (71).
DKA was found to be consistently char-
acterized across studies. In part, this con-
sistency was due to the well-known clinical
effects of ketoacidosis, particularly low
blood pH. Where definitions varied, the dis-
crepancies are predominantly seen in minor
changes to the range of what was consid-
ered mild or severe.
Definition
Although the current definition for DKA
includes a list of multiple criteria that
must be met, not all information currently
included in the accepted definition is
consistently gathered or required to diag-
nose DKA. The Steering Committee defines
DKA in individuals with type 1 diabetes in a
clinical setting as the following:
c Elevatedserumorurineketones(greater
than the upper limit of the normal
range), and
c Serum bicarbonate ,15 mmol/L or
blood pH ,7.3
Given the seriousness of DKA, it is un-
necessary to stratify DKA into different
levels or categories, as the presence of
DKAdregardless of the differences ob-
served in the separate biochemical
testsdshould always be considered seri-
ous. In individuals with known diabetes,
plasma glucose values are not necessary
to diagnose DKA. Further, new therapeu-
tic agents, specifically sodium–glucose
cotransporter 2 inhibitors, have been
linked to euglycemic DKA, or DKA with
blood glucose values ,250 mg/dL (13.9
mmol/L). Numerical values for urine or
serum ketones are not specified in the
DKA definition due to the variation in
assay normal ranges across laboratory
settings.
Gaps in Evidence and Measurement
DKA is a well-understood condition with
well-recognized signs and symptoms. The
current evidence is sufficient to support
the definition described. Nevertheless,
additional studies are needed to establish
more definitive information about the ef-
fects of DKA and of recurrent DKA over
time, including connections to vascular
and cognitive complications. This limita-
tion in research is likely due to studies of
patientswithDKAtypically beginningonly
once patients are admitted to the hospi-
tal. There is also no evidence to suggest
that there is a “safe” or benign amount of
time to experience DKA; this may be a
question worth exploring as, for example,
varying degrees of DKA severity might
have different long-term outcomes.
PROs
In guidance released in 2009 (72), the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) de-
fined PROs as “any report of the status of
a patient’s health condition that comes
directly from the patient, without inter-
pretation of the patient’s response by a
clinician or anyone else.” In the same doc-
ument, the FDA clearly acknowledged the
importance of PROs, advising that they be
used to gather information that is “best
known by the patient or best measured
from the patient perspective.”
Measuring and using PROs is increas-
ingly seen as essential to evaluating care
from a patient-centered perspective,
which is a key aspect of health care re-
form efforts under the National Quality
Strategy (73). PROs can capture informa-
tion helpful for guiding diabetes care
teams on which aspects of their care de-
livery they need to improve (74). Stake-
holders have advocated for the inclusion
of PROs as a component of a complete
diabetes measure portfolio (75).
Given that type 1 diabetes is a chronic
condition primarily treated on an outpa-
tient basis, much of what people with
type 1 diabetes experience is not cap-
tured through standard clinical measure-
ment.Measures that capture PROs can fill
these important information gaps. A vari-
ety of validated measures (including sur-
veys and questionnaires) of some PROs
for youth and adults with type 1 diabetes
are available and are used in clinical stud-
ies, including those for diabetes distress
(76) and fear of hypoglycemia (77). Work
to further develop and validate tools and
measures for diabetes health-related
quality of life is ongoing.
Gaps in Measurement and Evidence
The use of validated PROs in type 1 di-
abetes clinical research is not currently
widespread, and challenges to effectively
measuring some PROs, such as quality of
life, continue to confront researchers and
developers. While many studies of type 1
diabetes treatments, including devices, in
some way assess PROs (78,79), further
work is needed to develop standard
PROs for type 1 diabetes, including as-
sessments of burden to patients. Such
measures would need to be applicable
across and between age ranges, settings,
and over multiple years to evaluate
trends in order to be relevant at the clin-
ical trial level.
CONCLUSIONS
The Steering Committee developed defi-
nitions for outcomes beyond HbA1c in
type 1 diabetes including hypoglycemia,
hyperglycemia, time in range, and DKA.
These definitions were based on rele-
vant published evidence and the clini-
cal experience and expertise of the
Steering Committee representatives and
members of the Advisory Committees.
