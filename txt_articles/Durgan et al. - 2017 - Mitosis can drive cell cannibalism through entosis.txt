Abstract Entosis is a form of epithelial cell cannibalism that is prevalent in human cancer,
typically triggered by loss of matrix adhesion. Here, we report an alternative mechanism for entosis
in human epithelial cells, driven by mitosis. Mitotic entosis is regulated by Cdc42, which controls
mitotic morphology. Cdc42 depletion enhances mitotic deadhesion and rounding, and these
biophysical changes, which depend on RhoA activation and are phenocopied by Rap1 inhibition,
permit subsequent entosis. Mitotic entosis occurs constitutively in some human cancer cell lines
and mitotic index correlates with cell cannibalism in primary human breast tumours. Adherent, wild-
type cells can act efficiently as entotic hosts, suggesting that normal epithelia may engulf and kill
aberrantly dividing neighbours. Finally, we report that Paclitaxel/taxol promotes mitotic rounding
and subsequent entosis, revealing an unconventional activity of this drug. Together, our data
uncover an intriguing link between cell division and cannibalism, of significance to both cancer and
chemotherapy.

Introduction
Cellular cannibalism is an ancient form of feeding used by bacteria (Gonza
´lez-Pastor et al., 2003)
and predatory amoebae (Waddell and Duffy, 1986) in response to starvation. A similar phenome-
non is observed among epithelial cells in human cancer (Brouwer et al., 1984; Overholtzer et al.,
2007; Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008; Sharma and Dey, 2011; Yang and Li, 2012; Cano et al.,
2012), suggesting this primeval process may promote survival within the tumour microenvironment
(Fais, 2007; Matarrese et al., 2008; He et al., 2013; Lozupone and Fais, 2015). Homotypic epithe-
lial cell cannibalism can occur by entosis, an intriguing process through which one live and viable cell
is completely engulfed by another, yielding a ‘cell-in-cell’ structure (Overholtzer et al., 2007). The
vast majority of internalised, entotic cells are ultimately killed and digested by their hosts, through a
mechanism involving non-canonical autophagy and lysosomal degradation (Yuan and Kroemer,
2010; Florey et al., 2011).

Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008) and is believed to mediate pleiotropic effects on cancer biology.
On one hand, entotic cell killing can limit outgrowth through the elimination of internalised cells
(Florey et al., 2011), representing a possible means of tumour suppression. Conversely, entosis
simultaneously promotes host cell survival and transformation, by providing valuable nutrients
(Fais, 2007; Krajcovic et al., 2013) and driving genomic instability (Krajcovic et al., 2011). Consis-
tent with these pro-tumorigenic effects, the frequency of entosis is found to increase with tumour
grade (Krajcovic et al., 2011), and cell-in-cell formation correlates with poor patient outcome

 (Schwegler et al., 2015; Schenker et al., 2017), suggesting this process may be associated with
tumour progression. Finally, entosis can mediate cancer cell competition (Sun et al., 2014a), allow-
ing one population to preferentially engulf and kill another, and may therefore contribute to shaping
tumour evolution. Together, these findings indicate that entosis can mediate both tumour suppres-
sive and promoting effects (Krishna and Overholtzer, 2016), but the overall impact of entotic cell
cannibalism on tumour biology and progression remains to be fully understood (Durgan and Florey,
2015).
Mechanistically, entosis involves the formation of adherens junctions and the generation of acto-
myosin-based contractility, which enables one cell to actively push or ‘invade’ into a more deform-
able neighbour, in an unconventional mode of engulfment (Overholtzer et al., 2007). This process
is known to be triggered by matrix deadhesion, which renders the cells unanchored and this contrac-
tile force unopposed. ROCK-mediated myosin phosphorylation is indispensable for entosis in cul-
tured cells (Overholtzer et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2014a; Wan et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014b) and
during embryonic implantation (Li et al., 2015). Accordingly, regulated changes in actomyosin con-
tractility, as induced by oncogenic K-Ras, can modulate entosis in suspension (Sun et al., 2014a); a
similar mechanism operates during the early stages of matrix adhesion (Wan et al., 2012).
Rho-family small GTPases regulate many fundamental cellular processes (Jaffe and Hall, 2005;
Heasman and Ridley, 2008), including entosis. RhoA controls actomyosin contractility through
ROCK, and blebbing through mDia, and is therefore indispensable for cell-in-cell formation
(Overholtzer et al., 2007; Yamada and Nelson, 2007; Purvanov et al., 2014). Similarly, Rac1 can
regulate myosin phosphorylation to modulate entotic cell competition (Sun et al., 2014a). Other
Rho-family members seem likely to influence cell cannibalism, through effects on the actomyosin
eLife digest For over a century, scientists looking down microscopes at samples from human
cancers have noticed cells eating other cells – in other words, cell cannibalism. The causes and
mechanisms involved in this unusual process, which is also known as entosis, are not well understood
and its relationship to cancer is complex. On one hand, cell cannibalism may promote cancer by
providing nutrients for growing tumours and making it more likely that genetic errors will occur. On
the other hand, this process may resist cancer by eliminating damaged cells.
In the laboratory, cell cannibalism has only been seen in cells that are detached from their
surroundings. Cells in the body are typically surrounded and supported by a mesh of proteins called
the extracellular matrix. However, within a tumour, cancer cells can often begin to grow without
being attached to the matrix, which means that cell cannibalism can occur. A protein called Cdc42
plays a part in how cells attach to each other and to the extracellular matrix, but the role of Cdc42 in
controlling entosis had not been previously explored.
Durgan et al. initially set out to ask whether Cdc42 was involved in the established process of cell
cannibalism, as seen in detached cells. However, the experiments showed that removing Cdc42
from human cells grown in the laboratory had little effect on this method of entosis. Unexpectedly,
though, the loss of Cdc42 did enable a different form of cell cannibalism in cells that remained
attached to the extracellular matrix, which had not been seen before. This new cannibalism process
is linked to cell division, with cells that are dividing or that have recently divided being consumed by
neighbours. This form of cell cannibalism is more commonly seen in cancers where the cells divide a
lot, and some chemotherapy drugs that interfere with cell division also increase the rate of cell
cannibalism.
During cell division a group of proteins – including RhoA and myosin – cause cells to become
rounder and stiffer. Durgan et al. suggest this allows the dividing cells to force their way inside other
cells, the key first stage of entosis. Since cancer cells divide often, this form of cell cannibalism may
lead to the cancer cells being destroyed by their healthy neighbours, in a form of “assisted suicide”.
This reveals an unexpected link between cell division and cell cannibalism, which is relevant to both
cancer and chemotherapy. Future work will explore whether entosis can be used to predict how a
cancer will progress in a patient, or how they will respond to a given treatment.

 cytoskeleton, cell-cell contacts or cell-matrix adhesion, but their contributions have yet to be investi-
gated. The present study was initiated to explore a possible role for Cdc42, a master regulator of
epithelial cell biology (Heasman and Ridley, 2008; Joberty et al., 2000; Etienne-Manneville, 2004;
Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007; Jaffe et al., 2008; Wallace et al., 2010; Roignot et al., 2013). Unex-
pectedly, this work has uncovered a novel mechanism of entotic cell-in-cell formation, driven by
mitosis. We present our findings on the relationship between epithelial cell division and cannibalism
and demonstrate its relevance to both human cancer and chemotherapy.
Results
Cdc42 controls cell-in-cell formation in adherent epithelial cells
To assess a possible role in entosis, Cdc42 was depleted in 16HBE human bronchial epithelial cells,
using multiple distinct and non-overlapping RNAi reagents. All Cdc42-specific duplexes and hairpins
yield a robust knockdown (Figure 1a), and induce expected functional changes, such as disruption
of adherens (AJ) and tight junction (TJ) maturation (Figure 1b) (Wallace et al., 2010). To initiate
entosis, cells were cultured in suspension for 8 hr (Figure 1c–d), inducing cell-in-cell formation
among ~10% of control cells, consistent with previous reports (Krajcovic et al., 2011). Surprisingly,
despite clear effects on AJ maturation, Cdc42 depletion has no major impact on cell-in-cell forma-
tion under these conditions, suggesting that primordial junctions are sufficient to support entosis.
Strikingly, however, we found instead that Cdc42 depletion promotes robust cell-in-cell formation in
adherent culture (Figure 1e–f), in which entosis would not be expected to occur. This surprising phe-
notype is reproducible and statistically significant across all RNAi reagents tested, corresponding
closely with knockdown efficiency (compare siCdc42.1/2), consistent with a specific, on-target effect
of Cdc42. Furthermore, adherent cell-in-cell formation is also observed in Cdc42-depleted MCF7
breast epithelia (Figure 1g–i), indicating that this process is consistent across multiple cell lines,
derived from different tissues of origin. Together, these data reveal that Cdc42 does not play a sig-
nificant role in conventional entosis, but unexpectedly controls a novel form of cell-in-cell formation
among adherent cells.
Adherent cell-in-cell formation shares the mechanistic features of
entosis
The adherent cell-in-cell structures observed upon Cdc42 depletion morphologically resemble those
formed through entosis. However, entosis is typically triggered by matrix detachment, occuring in
suspension (Overholtzer et al., 2007), or during the early stages of adhesion (6–8 hr after plating)
(Wan et al., 2012). To determine whether adherent cell-in-cell formation otherwise bears the hall-
marks of entosis, additional characteristics were analysed. Firstly, Cdc42 was co-depleted with a-cat-
enin, a core junctional component that is indispensible for entosis (Wang et al., 2015) (Figure 1j–l).
a-catenin depletion yields profound AJ defects, and a corresponding reduction in cell-in-cell forma-
tion, in line with an entotic mechanism. Next, the involvement of actomyosin contractility was
assessed, which drives suspension entosis downstream of RhoA/ROCK (Overholtzer et al., 2007).
Inhibition of ROCK dramatically suppresses cell-in-cell formation among Cdc42-depleted cells
(Figure 1l), like entosis under detached (Overholtzer et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2014a, 2014b), semi-
adherent (Wan et al., 2012) or in vivo conditions (Li et al., 2015). Consistent with this, active, phos-
pho-myosin (pS10-MLC2) is clearly enriched in the internalising cell tail (Figure 1m). Finally, entotic
cell cannibalism characteristically involves non-canonical autophagy (Florey et al., 2011) and lyso-
somal degradation (Overholtzer et al., 2007; Krajcovic et al., 2013). Consistent with this mecha-
nism, both LC3 (an autophagy protein) and LAMP1 (a lysosomal marker) are transiently recruited to
the vacuoles of Cdc42-depleted cell-in-cell structures (Figure 1n). Taken together, these data reveal
that entosis can indeed occur among adherent epithelial cells and suggest that a distinct mechanism
must trigger cell-in-cell formation under these conditions.
Mitosis drives entosis in adherent cells
To investigate the mechanism underlying adherent entosis, long-term timelapse imaging was used
to track live cell-in-cell formation events among Cdc42-depleted cells. Representative movies and
stills are shown (Figure 2a–c, Videos 1–3). During every cell-in-cell event analysed, the inner cell

 penetrates its host either during, or shortly after, mitosis. Several permutations of this process were
observed, with one or both daughters penetrating the same or different hosts, or one daughter
invading the other and both entering an adherent neighbour (cell-in-cell-in-cell). To support these
studies, fixed, adherent, entotic events were visualised at a mid-way point by IF/3D-correlative light-
electron microscopy (CLEM; Figure 2d, Videos 4–5). In each case, mitotic cells were observed inter-
nalising into adherent neighbours. These comprehensive imaging studies establish a clear relation-
ship between cell division and cell-in-cell formation, suggesting that mitosis may drive entosis in
adherent cell populations. To test this model more directly, Cdc42-depleted cells were arrested at
the G2/M boundary using a Cdk1 inhibitor (RO-3306). Strikingly, inhibition of mitosis leads to a pro-
found decrease in cell-in-cell formation in matrix-attached, but not detached conditions (Figure 2e).
These data indicate that cell division drives adherent, but not suspension, entosis, highlighting two
mechanistically distinct routes to epithelial cell cannibalism.
Dividing cells can be cannibalised by fully adherent, wild-type
neighbours
To investigate the process of mitosis-induced entosis further, we examined the role of Cdc42 more
closely, testing whether its depletion affects the internalising mitotic cell, or its host. Control and
Cdc42-depleted cells were labelled red or green, respectively, and then reseeded to yield an equally
mixed monolayer. Inner/outer cell identities were scored among the adherent, cell-in-cell structures
formed (Figure 2f–g). In almost all pairs, the inner cell is Cdc42-depleted. These cells penetrate con-
trol or knockdown neighbours with equal frequency, and the results are unchanged by dye reversal
(data not shown). These findings establish that loss of Cdc42 specifically promotes internalisation,
enabling a dividing cell to ‘invade’ into an adherent neighbour, while having no detectable effect on
the host. Given that wild-type cells act efficiently as hosts, we can exclude the possibility that Cdc42-
depletion promotes entosis by impairing cell-matrix contacts to ‘mimic’ deadhesion. To verify this
further, Cdc42-depleted cells were mixed with wild-type cells expressing RFP-zyxin, an adhesome
component (Horton et al., 2015). Basal RFP-zyxin-positive foci are observed within entotic hosts
(Figure 2h), reinforcing the conclusion that the host cell can be fully matrix-adhered. Finally, we ana-
lysed the consequences of mitosis-induced entosis under adherent conditions. Cdc42-depleted
16HBE cell-in-cell structures were followed by timelapse microscopy and the fate of the internalised
cell recorded (Figure 2i–j). As in suspension conditions (Overholtzer et al., 2007; Florey et al.,
2011), the majority of internalised cells die, by either non-apoptotic or apoptotic means, within the
entotic vacuole, establishing mitotic entosis in adherent cells as a means of epithelial cell cannibal-
ism. Together, our data demonstrate that loss of Cdc42 permits a dividing cell to ‘invade’ into a
neighbour by entosis, and clarify that the host cell can be wild-type and fully adherent. These find-
ings raise the intriguing concept that normal, adherent epithelia may engulf, kill and digest dividing
neighbours under certain conditions.
Cdc42 controls mitotic morphology in polarised epithelia
Our findings support a model in which epithelial Cdc42 inhibits entosis among mitotic cells. To inves-
tigate the possible mitotic functions of Cdc42, dividing cells were analysed by flow cytometry and
microscopy. No gross defects in cell cycle progression are detected upon Cdc42-depletion by flow
cytometric analysis of DNA content (Figure 3a). However, imaging studies reveal significant morpho-
logical changes during cell division. Control and Cdc42-depleted cells were visualised during the

 different phases of mitosis, in live cells stained for plasma membrane and DNA (Figure 3b). Consis-
tent with previous reports, we observed that Cdc42-depletion can misorient the plane of division
(Jaffe et al., 2008; Roignot et al., 2013), while control cells divide parallel to the substrate, the
plane of division in Cdc42-depleted cells is randomised. However, this phenotype seems unlikely to
drive
cell-in-cell
formation,
as
aPKC-depletion
promotes
similar
spindle
misorientation
(Durgan et al., 2011), with no detectable effect on entosis under these conditions (Figure 3—figure
supplement 1). Interestingly, we also identified additional, unanticipated changes in mitotic mor-
phology upon Cdc42-depletion (Figure 3b–d). Like other polarised epithelia (Reinsch and Karsenti,
1994), WT-16HBE cells bulge as they enter prometaphase, but retain both cell-cell and cell-matrix
contacts throughout mitosis (Figure 3b, upper
panel). In contrast, from prometaphase onwards,
Cdc42-depleted cells exhibit reduced spreading,
associated with a diminished adhesive surface
area, and dramatic rounding, a closely related
phenomenon
(Marchesi
et
al.,
2014)
(Figure 3b, lower panel). These morphological
changes can be quantified by calculating height/
length,
as
a
measure
of
cell
spreading
(Figure 3c), and circularity, as a score of round-
ness (Figure 3d). Across multiple reagents and
experiments, Cdc42-depletion consistently and
significantly augments mitotic deadhesion and
rounding. These data uncover a novel role for
Cdc42

controlling

Cdc42 regulates cortical RhoA
activity in mitotic cells
We next considered the molecular mechanisms
through which Cdc42 may regulate mitotic mor-
phology and entosis, with RhoA emerging as a
compelling candidate player. RhoA, another of
the major small GTPases, has been implicated in

 (Overholtzer et al., 2007) through previous
studies. To investigate a possible role here, the
spatiotemporal activation of RhoA was assessed
using
a
FRET-based
biosensor,
RhoA-FLARE
(Sun et al., 2014b; Pertz et al., 2006). Control
or Cdc42-depleted 16HBE cells expressing the
RhoA biosensor were subjected to live confocal
imaging for CFP (FRET donor) and YFP (FRET
acceptor), as well as DNA (Hoechst) and DIC
(Figure 4a); RhoA activation is proportional to
the
FRET/CFP
emission
ratio.
While
control
16HBE cells show a relatively low level of RhoA
activity during metaphase, a clear enrichment of
active RhoA is frequently observed at the meta-
phase cortex among Cdc42-depleted cells (37%;
Figure 4b). Related to this, an increase in corti-
cal actin can also be observed among Cdc42-depleted, metaphase cells (Figure 4c). Together, these
data indicate that Cdc42 constrains mitotic RhoA activation in polarised epithelial cells, and accord-
ingly, that loss of Cdc42 permits overactivation of cortical RhoA during metaphase.
RhoA activity controls mitotic morphology
To test whether deregulated RhoA activation influences mitotic morphology, live Cdc42-depleted
cells were treated with a cell permeable form of C3 Transferase, a toxin that selectively ribosylates
and inactivates RhoA/B/C (Barbieri et al., 2002), to block downstream signalling (Figure 4d).
Although mitotic cells do remain somewhat rounded in the presence of this toxin, inhibition of the
Rho proteins has a clear impact on mitotic spreading, yielding a significant increase in basal area,
and thus partially reversing the effect of Cdc42-depletion (Figure 4e). These data are consistent
with previous studies that have implicated RhoA activity in mitotic cell retraction, rigidity and round-
ing (Maddox and Burridge, 2003; Matthews et al., 2012), along with its targets ROCK
(Maddox and Burridge, 2003; Meyer et al., 2011) and myosin (Matthews et al., 2012). To explore
this observation further, live Cdc42-depleted cells were treated with additional pathway inhibitors,
and suppression of ROCK (Y-27632) or myosin (blebbistatin) activity similarly rescued mitotic cell
spreading in Cdc42-depleted cells (Figure 4d–e). Together, these data indicate that aberrant activa-
tion of a Rho/ROCK/myosin cascade during mitosis can drive enhanced retraction and rounding.
Based on these findings, we would predict that RhoA inhibition may also suppress mitotic entosis
upon Cdc42-depletion, by reverting these induced changes in mitotic morphology. Unfortunately, it
is not possible to demonstrate this link unambiguously, because RhoA inhibition will block entotic

 cell-in-cell formation regardless of its trigger, due
to downstream effects on myosin contractility
(Overholtzer et al., 2007) and actin dynamics
(Purvanov et al., 2014). As such, while we can
clearly implicate RhoA in both mitotic rounding
and cell-in-cell formation, we cannot definitively
dissect the process of mitotic entosis further by
targeting RhoA alone.
Enhanced mitotic deadhesion and
rounding can induce entosis: Rap1
As an alternative approach to determine whether
mitotic deadhesion and rounding is sufficient to
drive entosis, mitotic morphology was manipu-
lated through other means. Rap1 is yet another
small GTPase, which, importantly here, is known
to control post-mitotic spreading (Dao et al.,
2009; Lancaster et al., 2013). Consistent with
this, we confirm that expression of DN-Rap1
reduces spreading and increases rounding during
16HBE division (Figure 5a–d). Strikingly, inhibi-
tion of Rap1, like Cdc42, also induces adherent
entosis, albeit at a lower level. Cell-in-cell forma-
tion among Rap1-inhibited cells occurs during or
shortly after mitosis (Figure 5e–g, Video 6) and
is inhibited by G2 arrest (Cdk1i). These data are consistent with a model in which enhanced mitotic
deadhesion and rounding drive subsequent cell-in-cell formation. In light of these data, we next
asked whether mitosis might promote entosis by simply providing an alternative route to matrix
deadhesion in one cell of the pair (the dividing, internalised cell). To address this, we tested whether
detached, interphase cells can similarly penetrate matrix-attached hosts. WT-16HBE cells were
labelled green, detached and then either overlaid onto wild-type monolayers (adherent hosts) or
maintained in suspension for 8 hr; the resulting cell-in-cell structures were scored (Figure 5h–i). Strik-
ingly, while detached interphase cells undergo efficient entosis in suspension (~8%), penetration of
adherent hosts is barely detectable. These data
indicate that simple loss of matrix-attachment is
insufficient to drive penetration of an adherent
host. Consistent with this, entosis has not been
observed
among
16HBE-monolayers
upon
depletion of matrix-adhesion proteins (e.g. b1-
integrin;
Figure
5—figure
supplement
1).
Together, these data indicate that mitotic dead-
hesion and rounding, which can be augmented
by inhibition of Cdc42 or Rap1, can drive the
entotic penetration of an adherent host cell,
while matrix-detachment during interphase can-
not. These findings infer important mechanistic
differences
between
cell
cannibalism
under
detached and adherent conditions. We conclude
that the distinctive biophysical changes associ-
ated with mitosis are an essential requirement
when entosis occurs in an adherent host.

 Mitosis-induced entosis occurs constitutively in adherent cancer cell
lines and human tumours with pleiotropic effects
Given that tumour cells are prone to undergo deregulated division and that mitotic rounding is pro-
posed to be of relevance in cancer (Cadart et al., 2014), we hypothesised that transformed cells
may undergo mitotic entosis constitutively. To test this, adherent cancer cell lines were examined by
fixed and live microscopy. Interestingly, MCF7 (breast) and HCT116 (colorectal) cells were found to
undergo adherent entosis under basal conditions. Importantly, cell-in-cell formation is coincident
with cell division, as shown by timelapse microscopy (Figure 6a–b, Videos 7–8), and is largely
dependent on progression through mitosis, in both 2D and 3D culture (Figure 6c–d). These data
indicate that mitosis drives constitutive adherent entosis in certain transformed tumour cell lines and

 raise the interesting possibility that cell division
may promote cell cannibalism in the proliferative
environment of a tumour. To investigate this
more directly, a tissue microarray of 75 human
breast invasive ductal carcinomas was analysed
(Figure
6e–g,
Supplementary
file
1).
Each
tumour core was stained for DNA, b-catenin and
p-Histone-H3 (pS10; a mitotic marker), and then
imaged in full and scored for mitotic activity
(mitotic cells/core) and entosis (cell-in-cell struc-
tures/core). 31/75 ductal carcinomas were posi-
tive for entosis, and among these, mitotic activity
positively correlates with cell-in-cell formation,
with statistical significance (Figure 6g). These
data are consistent with the notion that mitosis
may drive entotic cell-in-cell formation in vivo.
During conventional entosis, the inner cell is typi-
cally
killed
(Overholtzer
et
al.,
2007;
Florey et al., 2011; Wan et al., 2012), while the
outer cell is rendered prone to division failure
(Krajcovic et al., 2011; Wan et al., 2012). To
determine whether similar anti- and pro-tumori-
genic consequences accompany mitotic entosis
among adherent cancer cells, the outcomes were
followed by timelapse and IF/confocal micros-
copy. Similar to suspension conditions, cell death
is the predominant fate for internalised cells fol-
lowing mitotic entosis, which can occur by either
non-apoptotic and apoptotic means (Figure 6h–
i). Host cell division failure was also analysed by
scoring for multinucleation. Again, similar to sus-
pension entosis, host cells are more frequently
multi-nucleated than surrounding single cells,
suggesting that abscission can be disrupted by entosis in adherent, as well as matrix-detached, con-
ditions (Figure 6j–k). Together, these data establish that mitosis-induced entosis occurs basally in
adherent cancer cell lines and human breast carcinomas. Mitosis-induced entosis can drive inner cell
killing, a potentially tumour suppressive effect, but also promotes host cell multi-nucleation, a route
to tumour-promoting genomic instability. These findings uncover an intriguing relationship between
cell division and cannibalism, of potential functional significance during tumour development and
evolution.
Taxane treatment promotes mitosis-induced entosis
Many cancers are treated chemotherapeutically with taxanes (e.g. Paclitaxel), which can induce
prometaphase arrest, multipolar division and cell death (Zasadil et al., 2014). As such, we hypothes-
ised that taxane treatment might influence cell cannibalism by modulating mitotic entosis. To test
this, 16HBE cells were incubated in the presence or absence of taxol, then imaged by timelapse or
IF/confocal microscopy (Figure 7a–c, Video 9). As expected, taxol treatment increases mitotic index
under these conditions, arresting the cells in prometaphase (in contrast to Cdk1i which arrests at
G2/M, inhibiting entry into mitosis). Importantly, taxol treatment also consistently increases cell-in-
cell formation under these conditions, in line with an induction of mitotic entosis. This effect can be
phenocopied with additional drugs that inhibit mitotic progression through different mechanisms,
including nocodazole (microtubule assembly inhibitor) and STLC (mitotic kinesin inhibitor), suggest-
ing that entosis occurs as a consequence of prometaphase arrest rather than microtubule stabilisa-
tion. Strikingly, we also find that taxol, nocodazole and STLC significantly enhance mitotic
deadhesion and rounding (Figure 7d–f), thus independently supporting the model that changes in
mitotic morphology are closely associated with adherent cell-in-cell formation. To investigate

cancer cells were examined. In both cultured cells
(Figure

(Figure 7i–l), 24 hr taxol treatment promotes a
significant increase in mitotic index, and a corre-
sponding induction of cell-in-cell formation, con-
sistent with mitosis-induced entosis. Notably, as
taxol is reported to inhibit MCF7 entosis in sus-
pension (Xia et al., 2014), these data further sug-
gest that the mechanisms of detached versus
adherent cell-in-cell formation are quite distinct.
Together, our findings establish that taxane treat-
ment enhances mitotic deadhesion and rounding
and promotes cell cannibalism through entosis,
and reinforce the conclusion that changes in
mitotic morphology can drive adherent entosis.
Moreover, these findings uncover some intriguing
and unconventional new effects of taxane treat-

Discussion
Cell
cannibalism
has
been
observed
within
tumours for over a century (Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008; He et al., 2013; Lozupone and Fais,
2015), but its underlying mechanisms and functional consequences remain to be fully understood.
Entosis is a form of homotypic epithelial cell cannibalism that is typically triggered by matrix-deadhe-
sion, and which proceeds through junction formation and the generation of actomyosin contractility,
culminating in cell engulfment and killing (Overholtzer et al., 2007). This process is regulated at var-
ious stages by Rho-family small GTPases, which govern the cytoskeletal and junctional components
upon which entosis depends (Overholtzer et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2014a; Purvanov et al., 2014).
This study set out to address whether Cdc42,

Wallace et al., 2010; Roignot et al., 2013), con-
trols entosis. Surprisingly, despite its well-docu-
mented control of the cytoskeleton, polarity and
epithelial junctions (Etienne-Manneville, 2004),
Cdc42 has little effect on entosis among cells
cultured in suspension. Unexpectedly, however,
we found that loss of Cdc42 can in fact promote
robust cell-in-cell formation among adherent
cells. This result was very surprising, because
entosis is not expected to occur under these
conditions (Overholtzer et al., 2007), but, this
process otherwise bears its hallmarks, involving

 entosis can indeed occur among matrix-attached cells, and define the associated mechanism.
Cdc42 is known to regulate cell-matrix contacts through b1-integrin in certain cancer cells
(Reymond et al., 2012), so it is plausible to hypothesise that its depletion may weaken focal adhe-
sions, or impair integrin signalling, to mimic detachment and so induce entosis. However, our data
are not consistent with this model. Firstly, control monolayers can efficiently internalise Cdc42-

 depleted neighbours, demonstrating that entotic
hosts can be wild-type and therefore fully adher-
ent. Secondly, neither enzymatic deadhesion, nor
depletion of b1-integrin, is sufficient to drive one
population of cells to penetrate surrounding
adherent neighbours. Together, these data indi-
cate that general changes in matrix-binding are
unlikely to fully account for adherent entosis.
In this study, we identify mitosis as a novel
trigger for entosis. We show that mitosis is indis-
pensable for adherent cell-in-cell formation, with
entosis occurring during, or shortly after, cell divi-
sion, and requiring transit through G2/M. In con-
trast, mitosis is not necessary for entosis in
suspension, indicating that quite distinct mecha-
nisms operate under different growth conditions.
Our findings identify an important new route to
entosis and uncover an intriguing relationship
between epithelial cell division and cannibalism,
of particular interest in the context of a prolifer-
ative and nutrient-deprived tumour.
Cdc42 activity is known to be cell-cycle regulated (Yoshizaki et al., 2003) and to control certain
mitotic processes, including kinetochore attachment and chromosome segregation (Chircop, 2014;
Yasuda et al., 2004); however, these roles appear unrelated to cell cannibalism. We have also found
little evidence to support a role for aPKC as a Cdc42 effector during adherent entosis, likely exclud-
ing mechanisms involving the polarity complex (Joberty et al., 2000), such as junctional remodelling
(Wallace et al., 2010), spindle orientation (Durgan et al., 2011), or control of the metaphase cortex
(Rosa et al., 2015). Instead, we have discovered an additional role for Cdc42 in regulating mitotic
morphology,
consistent
with
previous
observations
in
NRK
(Zhu
et
al.,
2011)
and
HeLa
(Mitsushima et al., 2009) cells. Upon Cdc42 depletion, mitotic deadhesion and rounding are signifi-
cantly enhanced. These phenotypes are associated with a prominent increase in cortical RhoA activ-
ity, and can be reverted by inhibition of RhoA, or its downstream effectors ROCK and myosin,
consistent with previous work (Maddox and Burridge, 2003; Matthews et al., 2012). We conclude
that Cdc42 plays a novel role in the regulation of mitotic morphology in polarised epithelial cells, in
a RhoA/ROCK/myosin-dependent manner. It is interesting to note that this Rho-dependent signal-
ling axis is also required for entosis among suspension cells (Overholtzer et al., 2007; Sun et al.,
2014a; Wan et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015), suggesting that some interesting mechanistic parallels
exist between these alternative routes to cell cannibalism.
The augmentation of mitotic deadhesion and rounding induced by Cdc42 suppression can be
phenocopied by inhibition of Rap1, or through drug-induced prometaphase arrest, and, importantly,
in each case is followed by subsequent cell-in-cell formation (Figure 8). Putting together the data
from these diverse conditions, we conclude that the distinctive biophysical changes associated with
mitotic deadhesion and rounding may uniquely enable a dividing cell to penetrate an adherent epi-
thelium, by which it is ultimately cannibalised. These findings add to the emerging concept that
mitotic

We report that the process of mitosis-induced entosis is observed basally among certain cancer
cell lines, establishing a broader biological incidence of this process. Moreover, we find that mitotic
index positively and significantly correlates with cell-in-cell formation in human breast invasive ductal
carcinomas, consistent with a pathophysiological occurrence in vivo. Importantly, as mitotic index is
one of the key criteria used to stage breast cancers, our findings can in part explain the increased
frequency of cell-in-cell structures among higher grade, more proliferative tumours (Krajcovic et al.,
2011; Gupta and Dey, 2003; Abodief et al., 2006). Our study thus contributes new insights into
the field of cell cannibalism in cancer, building on the emerging notion that cell-in-cell formation

 correlates with more aggressive disease (Krajcovic et al., 2011) and may provide prognostic indica-
tions (Schwegler et al., 2015; Schenker et al., 2017).
In relation to cancer, we also report the chemotherapeutic induction of mitotic entosis as a novel
and unanticipated effect of Paclitaxel/taxol treatment. Interestingly, we find that Paclitaxel enhances
mitotic deadhesion and rounding, thereby driving subsequent cell-in-cell formation through entosis.

(Weaver, 2014), which can cause prometaphase arrest, multipolar divisions and cell death
(Zasadil et al., 2014). As such, these additional and unconventional activities in modifying mitotic
morphology and driving cell cannibalism through entosis may be of potential clinical interest.
Finally, we show that the outcome of entosis is broadly conserved, whether it is triggered by
deadhesion or mitosis, within an adherent or detached host cell (Figure 8). On one hand, entosis
drives internalised cell killing, a potential means of limiting growth (Florey et al., 2011). We find
here that the host cell can be wild-type and fully adherent, developing an intriguing model in which
aberrantly dividing cells may penetrate, and be eliminated by, the surrounding normal epithelium, in
a tumour-suppressive act of ‘assisted suicide’. On the other hand, we also show that mitosis-induced
entosis can disrupt host cell division, with the potential to drive genomic instability (Krajcovic et al.,
2011). In this case, an alternative model emerges in which one aberrant division promotes more,
thereby contributing to tumour progression. These models are not mutually exclusive and the overall
impact of entosis on tumour biology remains the focus of ongoing work (Durgan and Florey, 2015).
In conclusion, we propose that there are at least two mechanistic routes to entosis: loss of matrix-
attachment and cell division. It is striking that anchorage independence and unrestrained prolifera-
tion, two classic hallmarks of cancer (Freedman and Shin, 1974; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011),
Figure 8. The triggers and consequences of entosis in cancer. Entosis can be triggered among epithelial cells through either matrix deadhesion or
aberrant mitosis. Mitotic entosis is associated with enhanced deadhesion and rounding during cell division, which can be induced by inhibition of
Cdc42 or Rap1, or through prometaphase arrest. RhoA activity is important in both suspension and mitosis-induced entosis, driving ROCK-dependent
myosin activation. Regardless of the triggering mechanism, entosis promotes both inner cell death and outer cell nutrient gain and multi-nucleation,
with the potential to confer both anti- and pro-tumorigenic effects.

 can both drive this form of cell cannibalism, so commonly observed in tumours. It will be worthwhile
through future work to assess whether additional features of cancer cells (e.g. stemness), or their
environments (e.g. hypoxia, nutrient deprivation), may similarly trigger entosis, and to more compre-
hensively investigate the effects of cell cannibalism on tumour development, progression and
evolution.
Material and methods
Cell culture and treatments
Cells were obtained from the following sources: 16HBE (Durgan et al., 2015) (from lab of Dieter
Gruenert, UCSF), MCF7 (Sun et al., 2014a) (Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University),
HCT116 (Sun et al., 2014a) (from lab of David Boone, University of Notre Dame), 293FT
(Durgan et al., 2011) (Invitrogen); all tested negative for mycoplasma (MSKCC core facility) and
were cultured as described previously. The following inhibitors were used: Blebbistatin (100 mM;
Sigma, UK), C3 Transferase (1 mg/ml; CT04 Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), Nocodazole (100 ng/ml;
Sigma), RO-3306 (5 mM; Sigma), STLC (20 mM, Santa Cruz, Dalla, TX), Taxol (1 mM; EMD), Y-27632
(10 mM; R&D, Minneapolis, MN); high-grade DMSO was used as a carrier control (1:1000; Sigma).
Retrovirus production and infection
For stable expression of shRNA (pSUPER, shCdc42.1 and 2, pSiren, shITGB1.1, shITGB1.2) or protein
(GFP, RFP-zyxin, HA-DN-Rap1, RhoA biosensor), cells lines were generated by retroviral infection
and selection as described previously (Durgan et al., 2011). Briefly, cells were seeded at 10^5 cells/
6-well, infected by centrifugation and stable cells were selected with Puromycin (1.5 mg/ml for
16HBE, 2.5 mg/ml for MCF7) for 2–5 days. Short-term stable pools of cells were prepared for each
experiment to avoid clonal effects.
shRNA
shRNA Cdc42 depletions were performed using hairpins cloned into pSUPER Puro vector: shCdc42.1
(cctgatatcctacacaacaaa), shCdc42.2 (cagatgtatttctagtctgtt). b1 integrin (ITGB1) depletions were per-
formed using hairpins cloned into pSiren Puro vector: shITGB1.1 (gccttgcattactgctgat), shITGB1.2
(gccttgcattactgctgatat). Stable pools were seeded at 2.5 � 10^4 cells/24-well and incubated for 3
days before analysis. siRNA depletions were performed using the following duplexes (Dharmacon,
Lafayette, CO): siControl (siLamin A/C; D-001620–02), siCdc42.1 (gauuacgaccgcugaguua), siCdc42.2
(cggaauauguaccgacugu), sia-catenin SMARTpool (M-010505-01-0005). 16HBE cells were transfected
using Lipofectamine LTX as described previously (Durgan et al., 2015). Briefly, cells were seeded at
2.5 � 10^4 cells/24-well and transfected with 1.25 ml Lipofectamine LTX + 1.25 ml 20 mM siRNA (or
10 mM + 10 mM for co-depletions) in antibiotic-free media, overnight. Media was changed the fol-
lowing day, with or without inhibitors (see figure legends), and cells incubated for at least 3 days to
optimise knockdown levels.
Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described previously (Durgan et al., 2008). The following anti-
bodies were used in this study: a-catenin (Sigma C2081; RRID:AB_476830; 1:1000; blocked with 5%
milk), Cdc42 (BD 610929; RRID:AB_398244; 1:250), GAPDH (Santa Cruz 25778; RRID:AB_10167668;
1:2000), HA (Covance MMS-101R; RRID:AB_291262; 1:2000; blocked with 5% milk), ITGB1
(cytoSM158, kindly provided by Dr Filippo Giancotti; 1:2500 blocked with 5% milk), Rap1 (Millipore
07–916; RRID:AB_2177126; 1:1000; blocked with 5% milk), a-tubulin (Serotec MCA77S; 1:2000;
blocked with 5% milk). Representative images of blots are shown.
FACS
2 � 10^5 shControl or shCdc42-16HBE cells were seeded on 60 mm dishes and incubated for 2
days. These cycling populations were fixed with EtOH and stained with propidium iodide as
described previously (Durgan et al., 2011). DNA content was analysed using a FACSCaliber to cap-
ture 10,000–30,000 events/sample. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software.

 Immunofluorescence
Unless otherwise indicated, immunofluorescence (IF) was performed as described previously
(Durgan et al., 2015). Briefly, cells were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (10 min, RT), perme-
ablised in 0.5% triton (5 min, RT) and then incubated with primary antibody in PBS (4C, overnight):
b-catenin (BD 610153; RRID:AB_397554; 1:100), p-MLC2 (Cell Signalling 3671L; RRID:AB_330249;
1:100), LC3 (Cell Signalling 4108; RRID:AB_2137703; 1:100), LAMP1 (BD 555798; 1:100), p-Histone
H3 (Millipore 06–570; RRID:AB_310177; 1:100), ZO-1 (Invitrogen 61–7300; RRID:AB_2533938;
1:100). Cells were washed in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488/568 goat anti-mouse/rabbit (H
+L) secondary (1:500) and Hoechst 3342 (1mg/ml) for 45 min at RT; where indicated, HCS CellMASK
Deep Red (Thermofisher, H32721) or Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (Cell Signalling, 8878S) were
included, to stain the cell body or actin respectively, according to the manufacturers’ guidelines.
Cells were washed with PBS, then water, and mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (Ther-
mofisher). Image acquisition was performed with a Confocal Zeiss LSM 780 microscope (Carl Zeiss
Ltd) equipped with a 40X oil immersion 1.4 NA objective, using Zen software (Carl Zeiss Ltd).
Live imaging
Cells were seeded on glass-bottomed dishes (Mattek, Ashland, MA) and incubated/treated as shown
in figure legends. Where indicated, cells were stained with CellTracker Green CMFDA, CellTracker
Red CMTPX or CellMASK deep red plasma membrane stain (Invitrogen, C10046) for 30 min, as rec-
ommended by the manufacturer (Thermofisher) and with Hoechst 33342 (1 mg/ml, Sigma), then
washed and returned to normal growth media for imaging. All live microscopy were performed in an
incubation chamber at 37˚C, with 5% CO2; for overnight imaging, media was overlaid with mineral
oil to prevent evaporation. For widefield timelapse microscopy, fluorescent and DIC images were
acquired every 8 min using a Flash 4.0 v2 sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu, Japan), coupled to a Nikon
Ti-E inverted microscope, using a 20 � 0.45 NA objective. Image acquisition and analysis was per-
formed with Elements software (Nikon, Japan). For live confocal imaging, the same microscope,
camera and software were used as described in the section above.
FRET analysis of RhoA biosensor
For emission ratio imaging, 16HBE cells stably expressing the RhoA-FLARE biosensor (a gift from Dr
Klaus Hahn, Addgene #12602) were seeded on 35 mm glass bottom dishes (Mattek) and treated
with siRNA as indicated. Hoechst 33342 was added prior to image acquisition. FRET images were
acquired with a Zeiss 780 confocal system equipped with a 40 � 1.4 NA objective lens. 458 nm exci-
tation light was used to excite the donor (CFP), with donor emission collected, 464–490 nm, and
acceptor (YFP) emission collected, 535–588 nm. Images were typically taken with a pixel size of 80
nm, a pixel dwell time of 0.97 ms and the pinhole set to 2 Airy units. Images were processed using
ImageJ. Briefly, all images were background subtracted and the FRET image was used to make a
binary mask and selection region. The FRET image was then divided by the CFP image yielding a
ratio image reflecting RhoA activity. A linear pseudocolour lookup table was applied. Only cells that
had a high enough signal-to-noise ratio in both the CFP and FRET signals were used.
3D-CLEM
Cdc42-depleted cells were cultured on 35 mm gridded glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek). Cells were
stained using CellTracker Green, CellMASK Plasma Membrane dye and Hoechst, then analysed by
live confocal microscopy. A mitotic cell-in-cell formation event was identified, imaged and its posi-
tion recorded. The cells were quickly fixed, processed, imaged and analysed by correlative serial
block face scanning electron microscopy as described previously (Russell et al., 2017).
Cell-in-cell formation assays: suspension culture
Cells were trypsinised on day 3 post-seeding or transfection, resuspended in growth media, �/+
inhibitors, and seeded at 10^5 cells/six-well on ultra-low adhesion dishes (Costar) for 8 hr. Following
suspension culture, 5 � 10^4 cells were transferred to a glass slide by cytospin at 300 rpm for 3 min,
fixed in 10% TCA and analysed by IF/confocal.

 Cell-in-cell formation assays: adherent culture
Cells were seeded on glass coverslips or glass-bottomed dishes, treated �/+ siRNA as indicated,
and incubated for 3 days. To analyse the effects of taxol, nocodazole and STLC, the drugs were
added to WT cells for a further 24 hr. To analyse the effect of Cdk1 inhibition, a Y-27632 wash-out
experiment was performed. Following siRNA transfection (16HBE) or seeding (16HBE-DN-Rap1,
MCF7), media was replaced with 10 mM Y-27632, to inhibit entosis. This treatment allowed a mono-
layer to form in the absence of cell-in-cell formation, thereby yielding a clean background. 3 days
later, Y-27632 was washed out, to permit entosis, and replaced with either control media or 5 mM
RO-3306 (a Cdk1 inhibitor). Cells were fixed and analysed 24 hr later.
Inner/outer cell identity assays
10^5 WT or GFP-expressing 16HBE cells were seeded per six-well and transfected with siControl or
siCdc42.2, respectively. WT cells were treated with Cell Tracker Red for 30 min, and then both cell
lines were trypsinised, mixed in equal proportion, then reseeded at 10^5 cells/well on 35 mm glass
bottomed dishes to yield mixed monolayers. 2 days later, the resulting entotic structures were ana-
lysed by live IF/confocal microscopy (d3 post-siRNA). The colours could be reversed with no change
in experimental outcome (ie. siControl/GFP cells, siCdc42/WT-red cells).
Mitotic morphology assays
10^5 16HBE cells were seeded/35 mm glass-bottomed dish and transfected with siCdc42. Three
days post-transfection, the cells were stained with CellTracker Green and Hoechst for 30 min, then
placed in fresh media for imaging. Metaphase cells were imaged by live DIC and confocal micros-
copy, with full z-stacks acquired. Images were analysed using ImageJ software. To measure mitotic
cell spreading, cell length was measured in a basal x/y section, cell height in the z, and height/length
ratio was plotted. For mitotic rounding, cell shape was analysed in the midplane x/y section of each
metaphase cell, scoring for roundness (where 1 = a perfect circle).
Mitotic spreading assays
10^5 16HBE cells were seeded/35 mm glass-bottomed dish and transfected with siControl or
siCdc42. On day 3 post-transfection, Cdc42-depleted cells were stained with Hoechst and treated
with C3 (1 mg/ml), Y-27632 (10 mM) or Blebbistatin (100 mM) for a further 4 hr. 10 min prior to imag-
ing, each dish of cells was treated with CellMASK deep red plasma membrane stain (Invitrogen,
C10046), and cells subjected to live IF/confocal imaging. Metaphase cells were identified by DNA
morphology and the basal section imaged. Basal spread area was measured using ImageJ.
3D culture
MCF7 cells were seeded in 3D matrigel using established protocols (Durgan et al., 2011), and incu-
bated to form early stage cysts (2–4 cells) in which matrix contacts are retained, to minimise the
induction of detachment-induced entosis. Briefly, four-well, glass-bottomed chamber slides (Lab-Tek
II; 155382) were coated with a thin layer of 80% Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced Membrane Matrix
(Corning; 356230)/20% Rat Collagen I (Cultrex; 3440-100-01), then overlaid with 5 � 10^4 cells in 2%
Matrigel/media; 10 mM Y-27632 was included to suppress basal detachment-induced entosis during
seeding. Cells were incubated for 24 hr to initiate cyst formation, Y-27632 was then washed out and
replaced with fresh media �/+ RO-3306 (5 mM), to allow cell-in-cell formation to proceed in 3D, in
the presence or absence of mitosis. Twenty-four hour later, cysts were formalin fixed, stained for
actin (488-phalloidin) and DNA (Hoechst) and imaged by confocal microscopy.
Tissue microarray (TMA)
A human breast cancer microarray was obtained from US Biomax (BR1505b), bearing 75 cases of
invasive ductal carcinoma (see Supplementary Figure 2). Each case was represented by duplicate
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cores, each with a diameter of 1 mm and a thickness of 5 mm.
The array was baked at 55˚C for 30 min, deparaffinised in xylene (2 � 10 min washes, RT) and rehy-
drated through sequential washes (2 � 100% EtOH, 1 � 70% EtOH, 1 � 30% EtOH, 3x H2O; 5 min
each at RT). Antigens were retrieved by boiling in 1x citrate buffer (Vector Labs) for 20 min, then
cooled back to RT. Blocking (45 min, RT) and antibody incubations were performed in TBS-T/5%

 BSA/0.1M Glycine; TBS-T was used for washes. Antibodies and mounting conditions are stated
above (see IF), with primaries incubated 4˚C/overnight, secondaries at RT/45 min and DAPI at RT/
10 min. The array was stained for: (1) b-catenin, to visualise adherens junctions (where present), (2)
p-Histone H3 (S10), a marker of mitosis, and (3) DAPI to visualise nuclear morphology. Each 1 mm
core was imaged in whole by DIC and confocal microscopy, using a 40 � 1.4 NA objective and tiling
a 6 � 6 grid. For each core, the number of p-Histone H3 (S10)-positive nuclei was counted as an indi-
cator of mitotic activity, and the number of cell-in-cell structures scored as a measure of entosis.
Xenografts
Six- to 8-week-old female athymic mice were implanted with b�17 estradiol pellets 3 days before
tumor implantation. 1 � 10^7 MCF7 cells were injected subcutaneously per tumour, in duplicate.
When tumours reached a size of ~150 mm^3, mice were treated with either vehicle, or 15 mg/kg
taxol. Twenty-four hour post-treatment, tumours were excised, formalin-fixed and 20 micron sections
were prepared (these relatively thick sections permit complete visualisation of whole engulfed cell-
in-cell structures). Sections were processed and stained as described for the TMA, and analysed by
DIC and IF/confocal (b-catenin, p-HH3/DNA). To account for tumour heterogeneity, five well-sepa-
rated fields of view (x/y) were captured from each of three distinct sections per tumour (z; from the
top, middle, bottom) using a 40 � 1.4 NA objective. The average number of pHH3-positive cells was
scored per FOV, per section. The total number of cell-in-cell structures in each section was scored.
