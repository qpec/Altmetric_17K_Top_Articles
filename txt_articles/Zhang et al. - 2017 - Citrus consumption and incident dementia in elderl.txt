Abstract
Although some experimental biological studies have indicated that citrus may have preventive effects against cognitive impairment, no cohort
study has yet examined the relationship between citrus consumption and incident dementia. In a baseline survey, we collected data on daily
citrus intake (categorised as ≤2, 3–4 times/week or almost every day) and consumption of other foods using a FFQ, and used a self-reported
questionnaire to collect data on other covariates. Data on incident dementia were retrieved from the Japanese Long-term Care Insurance
database. A multivariate-adjusted Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI for incident dementia according to citrus
consumption. Among 13 373 participants, the 5·7-year incidence of dementia was 8·6 %. In comparison with participants who consumed citrus
≤2 times/week, the multivariate-adjusted HR for incident dementia among those did so 3–4 times/week and almost every day was 0·92
(95 % CI 0·80, 1·07) and 0·86 (95 % CI 0·73, 1·01), respectively (Ptrend = 0·065). The inverse association persisted after excluding participants
whose dementia events had occurred in the first 2 years of follow-up. The multivariate HR was 1·00 (reference) for ≤2 times/week, 0·82
(95 % CI 0·69, 0·98) for 3–4 times/week and 0·77 (95 % CI 0·64, 0·93) for almost every day (Ptrend = 0·006). The present findings suggest that
frequent citrus consumption was associated with a lower risk of incident dementia, even after adjustment for possible confounding factors.
Key words: Citrus: Dementia: Cohort studies: Elderly: Japan
Dementia is a major cause of disability worldwide(1). In the
absence of curative treatment, strategies for prevention of
dementia are important. Since diet could be an important
modifiable risk factor for dementia, nutritional interventions
might help to decrease the incidence of dementia(2).
Citrus fruits are consumed worldwide. The edible parts of
citrus, such as the segment epidermis tissue and juice vesicle
tissue, are rich in citrus flavonoids(3). Previous in vivo and
in vitro studies have reported that citrus flavonoids have
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities(4,5), and can
increase neuronal signalling(6), improve metabolic functions(7,8)
and cross the blood–brain barrier(9). In addition, some flavo-
noids — such as naringin and hesperidin — are essentially
unique to citrus(10,11). Thus, it is expected that habitual intake of
citrus would lower the risk of incident dementia through
neuroprotective effects and promotion of brain function.
To date, only one epidemiological (cross-sectional) study has
suggested that high intake of citrus(12) was positively associated
with better cognitive function (including episodic memory,
executive function, perceptual speed and executive function,
visuospatial skills and global cognition). Thus, an assumption
that a high intake of citrus might have a preventive effect against
dementia could be reasonable. However, as cross-sectional
studies may be generally affected by reverse causation, any
association between citrus intake and onset of dementia would
be better investigated by a cohort study. To our knowledge,
however, no cohort study has yet examined this issue.
The purpose of the present cohort study was to examine the
relationship between habitual citrus consumption and incident
dementia.
Methods
Study cohort
The design of the Ohsaki Cohort 2006 Study has been described
in detail elsewhere(13). In brief, the source population for the
baseline survey comprised 31 694 men and women aged
≥65 years who were living in Ohsaki City, northeastern Japan,
on 1 December 2006.
The baseline survey was conducted between 1 December
and 15 December 2006, and follow-up of the participants star-
ted from 1 April 2007. A questionnaire was distributed by the
heads
of
individual
administrative
districts
to
individual
households and then collected by mail. In this analysis, 23 091
persons who provided valid responses formed the study cohort
(Fig. 1). We excluded 6333 persons who did not provide written

information, 2102 persons who had already been certified as
having disability by the LTCI before follow-up (1 April 2007),
sixty-two persons who had died or moved out of the district
during the period of the baseline survey, 192 persons whose
Doctor’s Opinion Paper and cognitive status in the paper were
unavailable and 1029 persons whose citrus consumption data
were missing. Thus, 13 373 responses were analysed for the
purposes of this study. During the 5·7-year period, only 124
persons were lost to follow-up because of migration from the
study area, without developing incident dementia, which pro-
vided a follow-up rate of 99·1 %. Among 66 338 person-years,
incident dementia was determined for 1143 persons (8·5 %).
Consumption of citrus and other foods
We asked about the consumption of citrus and other food items
using a FFQ. The questionnaire included thirty-nine food
items and several beverages. The term ‘total vegetables’ was
defined as the sum of five food items (i.e. green vegetables, carrot
and pumpkin, tomato, cabbage and lettuce and Chinese cabbage),
and the term ‘other fruits’ referred to fruits (except citrus fruits)
and fresh juice. For the majority of food items, five frequency
categories
were
applied
(almost
never,
1–2 times/month,
1–2 times/week, 3–4times/week, almost every day).
We conducted a validation study of the FFQ in which 113
respondents provided four 3-d food records within 1 year and
subsequently responded to the questionnaire. The Spearman
rank
correlation
coefficient
between
citrus
consumption
according to the questionnaire and that according to the food
records was 0·56 for men and 0·51 for women; the correlation
between the consumptions measured by the two questionnaires
administered 1 year apart was 0·61 for men and 0·53 for
women(14).
Covariates
BMI was calculated as the self-reported body weight (kg)
divided by the square of the self-reported body height (m).
The
K6
was
used
as
an
indicator
of
psychological
distress(15,16). Using six questions, respondents were asked
about their mental status over the last month. Total point scores
ranged from 0 to 24. As the optimal cut-off point for mental
illness in the validation study, we classified individuals with
scores of ≥13 as having psychological distress(16).
The Kihon Checklist was developed by the Ministry of
Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan to predict functional
decline in community-dwelling elderly. With regard to the
motor function score in the Kihon Checklist, respondents were
asked about their current motor function status using five binary

 questions, yielding total point scores ranging from 0 to 5. As the
optimal cut-off point for functional decline suggested in the
validation study, we classified individuals with scores of <3 as
having better motor function(17). With regard to the cognitive
function score in the Kihon Checklist, respondents were asked
about their current cognitive function status using three binary
questions yielding total point scores ranging from 0 to 3. The
validity of the cognitive function score in the Kihon Checklist
had been confirmed in a previous study using the Clinical
Dementia Rating as a gold standard(18).
Follow-up (incident dementia)
The primary outcome was incident dementia, defined as dis-
abling dementia according to the criteria of the LTCI system
used in Japan(19).
The LTCI is a mandatory form of national social insurance to
assist daily activity in the disabled elderly(20–22). Everyone aged
≥40 years pays premiums, and everyone aged ≥65 years is
eligible for formal caregiving services under a uniform standard
of disability certification. The procedure for disability certification
comprises two parts: (1) assessment of the degree of functional
disability using a questionnaire developed by the Ministry of
Health, Labour, and Welfare, and (2) reference to the Doctor’s
Opinion Paper prepared by the attending physician(23).
Disabling dementia was defined as incident functional dis-
ability due to dementia according to the LTCI system, the
dementia exceeding rank I (rank ≥II) on the Dementia Scale
(Degree of Independence in Daily Living for Elderly with
Dementia), as entered on the Doctor’s Opinion Paper. The
Dementia Scale is classified into six ranks (0, I–IV, M. Rank M
means
that
an
individual
has
severe
dementia-related
behavioural disturbance that requires medical intervention),
and a rank exceeding I is usually used as an outcome measure
of incident dementia because individuals who have mild or
moderate dementia are classified as rank II(19,24–26). A previous
study has shown that the Dementia Scale is well correlated with
the Mini Mental State Examination score (Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient = − 0·736)(27).
We obtained a data set that included information on LTCI
certification, death or emigration from Ohsaki City. All data were
transferred from the Ohsaki City Government under an agree-
ment related to Epidemiologic Research and Privacy Protection.
Ethical issues
We considered the return of completed questionnaires to imply
consent to participate in the study involving the baseline survey
data and subsequent follow-up of death and emigration. We also
confirmed information regarding LTCI certification status after
obtaining written consent along with the questionnaires returned
from the subjects at the time of the baseline survey. The Ethics
Committee of Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine
(Sendai, Japan) reviewed and approved the study protocol.
Statistical analysis
We counted the person-years of follow-up for each subject from
1 April 2007 until the date of incident dementia, date of
emigration from Ohsaki City, date of death, incident functional
disability without dementia or the end of the study period
(30 November 2012), whichever occurred first.
In the present study, only 3·8 % of participants almost never
consumed citrus fruits, and 11·6 % consumed them 1–2 times/
month. Therefore, data for these two options were merged with
the option ‘1–2 times/week’. Thus, citrus fruit consumption was
categorised into three groups: ≤2, 3–4 times/week and almost
every day.
The multiple adjusted Cox proportional hazards model was
used to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI for incident
dementia according citrus consumption. Dummy variables
were created for the citrus consumption groups, and respon-
dents who consumed citrus ≤2 times/week (lowest) were
defined as a reference category. Multivariate models were
adjusted for the following variables. Model 1 was adjusted for
age (65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84 or ≥85 years) and sex. To
examine whether the association between citrus consumption
and dementia was attributable to a healthy physical status or
other lifestyle factors, model 2 was further adjusted for BMI
(<18·5, 18·5–25, ≥25 kg/m2 or missing), history of disease
(stroke,
hypertension,
myocardial
infarction
or
diabetes)
(yes, no; for each term), education level (age at last school
graduation: <16, 16–18, ≥19 years or missing), smoking (never,
former, current or missing), alcohol drinking (never/former,
current or missing), time spent walking (<1, ≥1 h/day or
missing) and psychological distress score (<13, ≥13 or missing).
In order to adjust for the influence of other dietary factors,
model 3 added the consumption volume of total vegetables,
and other fruits, intake of energy and protein (sex-specific
tertile categories, or missing).
Considering possible reverse causality, we analysed whether
the association would change if only individuals who had
higher cognitive function at the baseline were selected. In this
sensitivity analysis, ‘Cognitive function score in the Kihon
Checklist = 0 point’ was defined as higher cognitive function.
Another sensitivity analysis was also conducted by excluding
participants whose disability event occurred in the first 2 years
of follow-up.
In addition, tests of interaction were performed to investigate
whether there was any difference in the relationship between
citrus consumption and incident dementia in terms of sex, age
(<75 or ≥75 years), consumption volume of total vegetables
and other fruits (≥ median for both, or otherwise), and chronic
conditions (stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction or
diabetes; having any one or more of these conditions, or having
none of them).
All analyses above were performed by using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Inc.).
Finally, multiple imputations were conducted for missing
values of all confounding factors in model 3. Based on age, sex
and other observed values of confounding factors, missing
values for each confounding factor were substituted with the
most likely value by the multiple imputation procedure, and ten
output
data
sets
were
created.
Then,
the
Cox
model
was applied for the imputed data with confounding factors
(without missing values) in model 3 to calculate the pooled
HR and 95 % CI for incident dementia according to citrus

 consumption. Both the multiple data imputation and the Cox
model were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM
Software Group).
All statistical tests described here were two-sided, and dif-
ferences at P < 0·05 were accepted as significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics
The baseline characteristics of the 13 373 participants according
to citrus consumption categories are shown in Table 1. Subjects
with a higher citrus consumption frequency were less likely to
be men, to have a history of stroke, to have been <16 years old
upon completion of education, to be current smokers and
alcohol drinkers, and to have psychological distress. Subjects
with a lower citrus consumption frequency were less likely to
consume vegetables and other fruits, and to intake protein and
energy.
Citrus consumption and incident dementia
The association between citrus consumption and incident
dementia is shown in Table 2. In comparison with participants
who consumed citrus ≤2 times/week, the incident dementia HR
was 0·79 (95 % CI 0·69, 0·91) for participants who consumed
citrus 3–4 times/week and 0·77 (95 % CI 0·67, 0·89) for those
who consumed citrus almost every day (Ptrend < 0·001 in the
crude model). Even after adjustment for most confounding
factors, the results for citrus consumption did not change sub-
stantially in model 2 (multivariate HR 1·00 (reference) for ≤2
times/week, 0·87 (95 % CI 0·76, 1·00) for 3–4 times/week and
0·79 (95 % CI 0·68, 0·91) for almost every day; Ptrend = 0·001).
However,
the
results
in
model
3
became
marginally
non-significant.
To consider the possibility that cognitive function at the
baseline might affect the association between citrus consump-
tion and incident dementia, we analysed the association after
selecting 8283 participants who had better cognitive function
(cognitive function score of the Kihon Checklist = 0), as shown
in Table 3. Although the point HR for higher citrus consumption
in all models still lower than the reference group, results of
models 3 and 4 were not significant.
To examine possible reverse causality in that participants who
had worse health status at the baseline might have consumed
less citrus, we also analysed the association after excluding 321
participants who developed incident dementia in the first 2 years
of follow-up (Table 4), but the results for citrus consumption did
not
change
substantially;
the
multivariate
HR
was

(reference) for ≤2 times/week, 0·82 (95 % CI 0·69, 0·98)

 for 3–4 times/week and 0·77 (95 % CI 0·64, 0·93) for almost every
day (Ptrend = 0·006 in model 3).
Stratified analysis
We also conducted sensitivity analysis stratified for sex, age (<75
or ≥75 years), consumption volume of total vegetables and other
fruits (≥ median for both, or otherwise), and chronic conditions
(stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes; having
any one or more of these conditions, or none of them). After
adjusting for multivariate factors, the inverse correlation between
citrus consumption and incident dementia did not differ between
subgroups (the Pfor interaction between citrus consumption and
each of the confounders was: 0·45 for sex, 0·13 for age, 0·45 for
consumption volume of total vegetables and other fruits and 0·08
for chronic conditions; data not shown).
Analyses of multiple imputed data
Another sensitivity analysis was also performed by using the
multiple imputed data to assess the association between citrus
fruits consumption and incident dementia without missing data for
confounding factors. The multivariate-adjusted results remained
consistent with the results of un-imputed data. The multivariate HR
was 1·00 (reference) for ≤2 times/week, 0·92 (95 % CI 0·79, 1·06)
for 3–4 times/week and 0·86 (95 % CI 0·73, 1·03) for almost every
day (Ptrend =0·090 in model 3; data not shown).
Discussion
In this cohort study, we investigated the relationship between
citrus consumption and incident dementia, and observed an

 our results are consistent with a previous cross-sectional study
indicating potential benefits of citrus intake in terms of cognitive
function(12). To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study to
have investigated the association between citrus consumption
and incident dementia in an elderly population.
Considering the possibility that individuals with weaker
cognitive function might have less opportunity to consume
citrus, we investigated the effects of reverse causality. However,
even when we selected only individuals who had better cog-
nitive function at the baseline, the point estimations (HR) for
each of the categories were also almost the same. In addition,
even after excluding individuals who developed incident
dementia in the first 2 years of follow-up, the inverse associa-
tion
between
citrus
consumption
and
incident
dementia
persisted. These findings suggest that the present results are
unlikely to have been attributable to reverse causality.
Even when we performed stratified analysis by sex, age,
consumption volume of total vegetables and other fruits, and
chronic conditions, the results for the relationship between
citrus consumption and incident dementia did not change
substantially. Therefore, the association between citrus con-
sumption and incident dementia seems difficult to explain in
terms of confounding factors.
In addition, in order to minimise potential bias attributed to
missing values for confounding factors, analysis of multiple
imputed data was performed. However, a similar inverse
association was also observed after all confounding factors had
been taken into consideration. Thus, the inverse association
may not be ascribed to bias of analysis in which missing values
were included.
In the area where the present study was conducted, mandarin
oranges (such as Satsuma (Citrus unshiu)) are the most common
citrus fruit consumed in daily life(28). The segment epidermis tissue
and juice vesicle tissue of these citrus fruits contain citrus flavo-
noids such as naringin, hesperidin, narirutin and neohesperidin(3).
Some experimental biological studies have suggested that these
citrus
flavonoids
have
neuroprotective
effects
(antioxidant
properties, anti-inflammation and signalling regulation)(29–32).
Therefore, the inverse relationship observed in the present study
might have been attributable to these citrus flavonoids.
Our study had a number of strengths: (1) it was a large
population-based cohort study involving 13 373 persons; (2) the
follow-up rate was very high (99·1 %); (3) many confounding
factors were taken into account; and (4) the study subjects lived
in an area in which citrus fruits are widely consumed.
However, there were also several limitations. First, the causes
of dementia were not evaluated, and therefore the mechanism
responsible for reduction of incident dementia by citrus
consumption remained unclarified. Second, information on
citrus consumption using the FFQ was obtained only at the
baseline, and the study subjects might have changed their citrus
consumption during the course of follow-up. Third, potential
confounding factors could not be disregarded. Particularly, it
could not be ruled out that residual diet-related confounding
factors were present, since our FFQ data could not fully con-
sider diet quality. Lastly, the relatively short follow-up time of
the participants might have compromised our findings. A cohort
study with a longer follow-up might therefore be desirable.
In conclusion, the present study has shown that citrus con-
sumption tended to be associated with a lower risk of incident
dementia in elderly Japanese individuals. Our results suggest that
habitual citrus consumption may have a preventive effect against
the incident risk of dementia. Further prospective studies in other
populations and settings will be necessary to confirm the
association between citrus consumption and dementia.
