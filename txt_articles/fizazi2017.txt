BACKGROUND
Abiraterone acetate, a drug that blocks endogenous androgen synthesis, plus predni-
sone is indicated for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We evaluated the 
clinical benefit of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone with androgen-deprivation ther-
apy in patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer.
METHODS
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1199 pa-
tients to receive either androgen-deprivation therapy plus abiraterone acetate (1000 mg 
daily, given once daily as four 250-mg tablets) plus prednisone (5 mg daily) (the 
abiraterone group) or androgen-deprivation therapy plus dual placebos (the placebo 
group). The two primary end points were overall survival and radiographic progression-
free survival.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 30.4 months at a planned interim analysis (after 406 pa-
tients had died), the median overall survival was significantly longer in the abiraterone 
group than in the placebo group (not reached vs. 34.7 months) (hazard ratio for death, 
0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.76; P<0.001). The median length of radio-
graphic progression-free survival was 33.0 months in the abiraterone group and 14.8 
months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.47; 95% 
CI, 0.39 to 0.55; P<0.001). Significantly better outcomes in all secondary end points 
were observed in the abiraterone group, including the time until pain progression, next 
subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, initiation of chemotherapy, and prostate-
specific antigen progression (P<0.001 for all comparisons), along with next symptom-
atic skeletal events (P 
= 
0.009). These findings led to the unanimous recommendation 
by the independent data and safety monitoring committee that the trial be unblinded 
and crossover be allowed for patients in the placebo group to receive abiraterone. Rates 
of grade 3 hypertension and hypokalemia were higher in the abiraterone group.
CONCLUSIONS
The addition of abiraterone acetate and prednisone to androgen-deprivation therapy 
significantly increased overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival in 
men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer. (Funded

etastatic, castration-sensitive 
prostate cancer accounts for approxi-
mately 3% of all new prostate-cancer 
diagnoses in the United States.1 Historically, 
androgen-deprivation therapy consisting of bilat-
eral orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone–releas-
ing hormone analogues, with or without first-
generation androgen-receptor inhibitors, has been 
the standard of care.2 Although the majority of 
patients have an initial response to androgen-
deprivation therapy, most men with metastases 
have progression to castration-resistant prostate 
cancer within a median of approximately 1 year.3-5 
Resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy is 
largely driven by the reactivation of androgen-
receptor signaling through persistent adrenal an-
drogen production, up-regulation of intratumoral 
testosterone production, modification of the bi-
ologic characteristics of androgen receptors, and 
steroidogenic parallel pathways.2
The clinical benefit of adding docetaxel to 
androgen-deprivation therapy versus treatment 
with androgen-deprivation therapy alone has been 
shown in three randomized, phase 3 trials — 
Chemohormonal Therapy Versus Androgen Ab-
lation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in 
Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED),5,6 Systemic Ther-
apy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: 
Evaluation of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE),7 and 
GETUG-153,8 — which collectively included more 
than 3000 men with metastatic, castration-sensi-
tive prostate cancer. Androgen-deprivation ther-
apy plus docetaxel is now a standard of care for 
men with metastatic, castration-sensitive pros-
tate cancer who are eligible for chemotherapy, 
particularly those with a high metastatic burden, 
as defined in the respective studies.9-11 Barriers 
to the use of docetaxel include advanced patient 
age, poor performance status, coexisting illness-
es, and patient preferences.9,12 Retrospective analy-
ses exploring real-world practice patterns13,14 indi-
cate that men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, 
castration-sensitive prostate cancer who are not 
being treated in clinical trials may be nearly a 
decade older than those treated in clinical trials. 
The concern with respect to chemotherapy-related 
toxicity and the effect of coexisting illnesses on 
complications is based on the severity of the 
toxicity that has been observed. Chemotherapy-
related deaths were documented in all three 
randomized trials in which docetaxel was added 
to androgen-deprivation therapy.3,5,7
Abiraterone acetate, the prodrug of abiraterone, 
inhibits cytochrome P-450c17, a critical enzyme 
in androgen biosynthesis.15,16 Recent studies im-
plicate its active D4A metabolite in antitumor 
effects, presumably through blockade of multi-
ple steroidogenic enzymes and antagonism of the 
androgen receptor.17 Abiraterone acetate (here-
after referred to as abiraterone) in combination 
with prednisone has been shown to significantly 
increase overall survival and provide additional 
clinical benefits in patients with metastatic, 
castration-resistant prostate cancer who have 
not received chemotherapy and in those who 
have received previous docetaxel.18-22 The combi-
nation of abiraterone plus prednisone and andro-
gen-deprivation therapy has been shown to reduce 
tumor burden in men with high-risk, localized 
prostate cancer who are receiving neoadjuvant 
therapy, which suggests a potential role for 
inhibiting extragonadal androgen biosynthesis 
before the emergence of castration resistance in 
men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-
sensitive prostate cancer.23,24 In LATITUDE, a 
multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the addition 
of abiraterone plus prednisone to androgen-
deprivation therapy, as compared with androgen-
deprivation therapy and dual placebos, on overall 
survival, radiographic progression-free survival, 
and clinically relevant measures in men with 
newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-sensitive 
prostate cancer.
Methods
Trial Design and Conduct
The trial was conducted at 235 sites in 34 coun-
tries in Europe, the Asia–Pacific region, Latin 
America, and Canada. The trial protocol (avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) 
was approved by the review board at each par-
ticipating institution. The trial was conducted 
according to the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and the International Conference on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guide-
lines. All the patients provided written informed 
consent.
An independent data and safety monitoring 
committee was commissioned by the sponsor, 
Janssen Research and Development, to review 
safety data on a regular basis and review effi-
cacy data at planned interim analyses. The trial

was designed by the senior academic authors and 
employees of the sponsor. Data were transcribed 
by trial personnel from source documents onto 
an electronic data-capture system prepared by the 
sponsor. The data analyses were performed by 
statisticians employed by the sponsor. All the 
authors assume responsibility for the complete-
ness and integrity of the data and for the fidel-
ity of the trial to the protocol. All the academic 
authors had full access to all parts of the data 
and drafted the manuscript with sponsor input, 
and all the coauthors subsequently provided in-
put. The sponsor provided funding for editorial 
assistance. All the authors and participating in-
stitutions have agreements with the sponsor re-
garding data confidentiality.
Patients and Treatments
Eligible patients were required to be at least 18 
years of age and to have an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status 
score of 0 to 2 (on a 5-point scale, with higher 
numbers indicating greater disability) with new-
ly diagnosed (≤3 months before randomization), 
pathologically confirmed prostate cancer with-
out neuroendocrine differentiation or small-cell 
histologic features. All the patients had high-risk, 
metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer, 
as documented by a positive bone scan or meta-
static lesions at the time of diagnosis on com-
puted tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), according to Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. 
In addition, the patients were required to have at 
least two of the three following high-risk factors 
associated with poor prognosis: a Gleason score 
of 8 or more (on a scale of 2 to 10, with higher 
scores indicating more aggressive disease), at 
least three bone lesions, and the presence of 
measurable visceral metastasis. Patients were 
excluded if they had received previous chemo-
therapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for meta-
static prostate cancer, with the exception of 
3 months or less of androgen- 
deprivation ther-
apy with luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone 
analogues or orchiectomy with or without con-
current first-generation androgen-receptor antag-
onists before baseline or one course of palliative 
radiation or surgical therapy to treat symptoms 
associated with metastatic disease.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive androgen-deprivation therapy and abira-
terone acetate (1000 mg daily, given once daily 
as four 250-mg tablets) and prednisone (5 mg 
daily) (the abiraterone group) or androgen-depri-
vation therapy and placebos (the placebo group). 
Patients were stratified according to the presence 
or absence of measurable visceral disease and 
ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1 vs. 2). 
Abiraterone or placebo was administered at least 
1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. All the 
patients who had not undergone surgical castra-
tion received ongoing androgen-deprivation ther-
apy to reach or maintain a serum testosterone 
level of less than 50 ng per deciliter (1.7 nmol 
per liter). Safety and dosing adherence were 
evaluated during each trial visit, at treatment 
discontinuation (if applicable), and at the end-of-
trial visit.
End Points
The two primary efficacy end points were overall 
survival and radiographic progression-free sur-
vival. Overall survival was defined as the time 
from randomization to death from any cause, 
and radiographic progression-free survival as the 
time from randomization to the occurrence of 
radiographic progression or death from any 
cause. Radiographic progression of soft-tissue 
lesions was evaluated by either CT or MRI on the 
basis of RECIST, version 1.1. Progression on 
bone scanning was assessed by adaptation of 
Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria (Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org).25 Potential bias favoring the abirater-
one group in the assessment of radiographic 
progression by investigators was audited with the 
use of the method of the Pharmaceutical Re-
search and Manufacturers Association26 in a sam-
ple of 202 randomly selected patients with blind-
ed central review.
Prespecified secondary end points were the 
time to the next “skeletal-related event” (described 
here as a “symptomatic skeletal event,” which 
was defined as a clinical or pathological frac-
ture, spinal-cord compression, palliative radia-
tion to bone, or surgery involving bone), time to 
progression with respect to prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) level on the basis of Prostate Can-
cer Working Group 2 criteria,25 time to the next 
therapy for prostate cancer, time to initiation of 
chemotherapy, and time to pain progression. 
Pain progression was defined as an increase of 
at least 30% from baseline in the worst pain

category on the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form 
as observed at two consecutive evaluations per-
formed at least 4 weeks apart.
Assessments
Efficacy assessments included sequential radio-
graphic imaging to assess radiographic progres-
sion-free survival (CT or MRI and bone scan-
ning) performed every 4 months, starting at 
week 16. PSA levels were measured at baseline, 
monthly in the first year, and then every 2 months 
until end-of-trial treatment. Patients underwent 
serial monitoring of vital signs, serum hemato-
logic and chemical findings, liver-function tests, 
and serum testosterone levels. Adverse events 
were graded with the use of the Common Termi-
nology Criteria for Adverse Events of the Na-
tional Cancer Institute, version 4.0.
Statistical Analysis
The overall level of significance was 0.05, with 
allocation between the two primary end points 
of overall survival (0.049) and radiographic pro-
gression-free survival (0.001) (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). For overall survival, 
852 events were required at the final analysis to 
detect a hazard ratio of 0.81 at a two-tailed sig-
nificance level of 0.049, with a statistical power 
of 85%. An analysis of radiographic progression-
free survival was planned when 565 progres-
sions or deaths had been observed, which would 
provide a statistical power of 94% to detect a 
hazard ratio of 0.667 at a two-tailed significance 
level of 0.001. Two interim analyses were included 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
overall survival analyses incorporated the group 
sequential design with an alpha spending func-
tion that was calculated as Wang–Tsiatis power 
boundaries of shape parameter 0.2 (which shape 
the probability distribution). Secondary end points 
were tested with the use of the Hochberg test 
procedure to control the familywise type I error 
rate. The primary statistical method of compari-
son for time-to-event end points was the strati-
fied log-rank test, according to the stratification 
factors. The Cox proportional-hazards model was 
used to estimate the hazard ratio and its associ-
ated 95% confidence interval.
Results
Patients and Treatments
A total of 1199 patients underwent randomiza-
tion from February 12, 2013, through December 
11, 2014. Of these patients, 597 were assigned to 
the abiraterone group and 602 to the placebo 
group (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The baseline demographic and disease charac-
teristics were well balanced between the two 
groups (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The results presented here are based on the 
clinical cutoff date of October 31, 2016, for the 
Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Two Primary End Points.
Shown are data for overall survival (Panel A) and for radiographic progression-
free survival (Panel B). The dashed lines indicate the median. The median 
rate of overall survival was not reached in the abiraterone group and was 
34.7 months in the placebo group; the corresponding medians for progres-
sion-free survival were 33.0 months and 14.8 months. CI denotes confidence

Abiraterone plus Prednisone in Prostate Cancer
first interim analysis of overall survival, at which 
time 406 deaths and 593 radiographic progres-
sions or deaths had occurred. At a median follow-
up of 30.4 months, the median time that the 
patients received the intervention was 24 months 
in the abiraterone group and 14 months in the 
placebo group. As a result of the findings at the 
time of the interim analysis, the independent data 
and safety monitoring committee unanimously 
recommended on January 12, 2017, that the trial 
be unblinded to allow crossover among the pa-
tients in the placebo group to receive abiraterone.
End Points
Overall Survival
The first interim analysis was performed after 
406 deaths (48% of the 852 deaths that were 
included in the final analysis) and a median 
follow-up of 30.4 months. Of these deaths, 169 of 
597 (28%) occurred in the abiraterone group and 
237 of 602 (39%) in the placebo group. The over-
all rate of survival at 3 years was 66% in the 
abiraterone group and 49% in the placebo group 
(Fig. 1A). The rate of death from any cause was 
28% in the abiraterone group and 39% in the 
placebo group (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The relative risk of death was 38% 
lower in the abiraterone group than in the pla-
cebo group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.76; P<0.001). The treatment 
effect of abiraterone on overall survival was consis-
tently favorable across nearly all prespecified sub-
groups (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Radiographic Progression-free Survival
At the time of the analysis, the median progression-
free survival was 33.0 months in the abiraterone 
group and 14.8 months in the placebo group 
(239 events vs. 354 events) — a 53% lower rela-
tive risk of radiographic progression or death in 
the abiraterone group than in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.55; P<0.001) 
(Fig. 1B). The treatment effect in the abiraterone 
group was consistent across nearly all prespec-
ified subgroups (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Secondary and Exploratory End Points
The superiority of abiraterone over placebo was 
shown for all secondary end points (Table 1 and 
Fig. 2, and Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The numbers of patients who received 
one or multiple life-prolonging subsequent ther-
apies were 125 (21%) in the abiraterone group 
and 246 (41%) in the placebo group (Table S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Docetaxel was the 
most common post-progression treatment in the 
two groups.
Safety
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in

in 48% of those in the placebo group (Table 2). 
The numbers of patients with serious adverse 
events were similar in the two groups. The fre-
quency of adverse events leading to treatment 
discontinuation was 12% in the abiraterone group 
and 10% in the placebo group (Table S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Adverse events that 
led to a dose modification or interruption were 
reported in 32% of the patients in the abiraterone 
group and in 17% of those in the placebo group. 
Grade 3 mineralocorticoid-related toxic effects 
of special interest, including hypertension and 
hypokalemia, occurred at a higher frequency in 
the abiraterone group than in the placebo group; 
rates of grade 3 and grade 4 hypertension were 
20% and 0%, respectively, in the abiraterone 
group and 10% and 0.2%, respectively, in the 
placebo group, with corresponding rates of hypo-
kalemia of 10% and 0.8% in the abiraterone 
group and of 1% and 0.2% in the placebo group 
(Table 2).
Discussion
In this phase 3 trial involving men with high-
risk, newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-
sensitive prostate cancer, the rate of overall 
survival was significantly higher among those 
who received androgen-deprivation therapy plus 
abiraterone and prednisone than among those 
who received androgen-deprivation therapy plus 
placebos, with a 38% lower relative risk of death

Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Secondary End 
Points.
Shown are the time to pain progression (Panel A), the 
time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression 
(Panel B), and the time to the next symptomatic skeletal 
event (Panel C). The dashed lines indicate the median. 
All analyses were performed with the use of a stratified 
log-rank test according to the stratification factors. The 
time to pain progression was time from randomization 
to the first increase of at least 30% from baseline in the 
worst-pain category on the Brief Pain Inventory–Short 
Form observed at two consecutive evaluations at least 
4 weeks apart. The median value for this category was 
not reached in the abiraterone group and was 16.6 months 
in the placebo group; the corresponding medians were 
33.2 months and 7.4 months for PSA progression; the 
medians for symptomatic skeletal events were not 
reached in either group.

Abiraterone plus Prednisone in Prostate Cancer
(hazard ratio, 0.62) in the abiraterone group. 
The addition of abiraterone plus prednisone to 
androgen-deprivation therapy also significantly 
prolonged radiographic progression-free survival 
(hazard ratio, 0.47) and all secondary end points. 
Since the between-group difference for overall 
survival was significant at the time of the first 
interim analysis and unblinding of the trial, this 
analysis is considered to be final.
We explored the utility of more effective 
blockade of the androgen-receptor axis with the 
addition of abiraterone to androgen-deprivation 
therapy in men with metastatic, castration-sensi-
tive prostate cancer. Our data support the hypoth-
esis that more effective inhibition of androgen-
receptor signaling as a component of the initial 
systemic therapy in patients with castration-
sensitive prostate cancer leads to improved out-
comes. The clinical benefit that we observed con-
trasts with that from the many previous attempts 
with castration and first-generation androgen-
receptor inhibitors,27,28 which showed only a 
small improvement with a combined androgen-
blockade approach,29 presumably owing to the 
lower potency and partial agonist activity of 
these drugs. Several other ongoing randomized, 
phase 3 trials in this patient population are ex-
amining androgen receptor–signaling combina-

Listed are the most common adverse events and events of special interest. The latter were selected on the basis of the safety profile of phase 2 
and phase 3 studies of abiraterone. ALT denotes alanine aminotransferase, and AST aspartate aminotransferase.
†  
Listed in descending order are events that were reported in at least 2% of the patients in either group. Among other events of special interest, 
grade 3 peripheral edema was reported in 0.3% of the patients in the abiraterone group and in 0.5% of those in the placebo group; grade 3 
or 4 fluid retention or congestive heart failure was not reported in either group. Grade 3 hot flush was reported in one patient in the placebo 
group, and grade 1 irritability was reported in three patients in the abiraterone group.

tion therapies with androgen-deprivation ther-
apy (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix) 
and are exploring whether these treatments can 
be added to androgen-deprivation therapy plus 
docetaxel in patients with metastatic, castration-
sensitive prostate cancer. The assessment of effi-
cacy of subsequent therapies, including the types 
of disease progression in patients who were re-
ceiving treatment, will require more long-term 
analysis.
Men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, castra-
tion-sensitive prostate cancer can have variable 
outcomes, so we purposely enrolled those who 
were considered to have at least two high-risk 
prognostic features (e.g., a Gleason score of ≥8, 
the presence of ≥3 bone lesions, or the presence 
of measurable visceral metastasis),30-33 all of which 
are associated with poor survival. In addition, 
50% of the patients had symptomatic disease at 
baseline. The patient population appears to be 
similar to high-burden disease populations in 
the three randomized trials that evaluated andro-
gen-deprivation therapy plus docetaxel,3,5,7 since 
the outcomes in the control groups were similar 
across those studies. After a median follow-up 
of 7 years in GETUG-15, a nonsignificant 22% 
reduction in the relative risk of death was ob-
served in patients with high-volume disease.8 A 
significant 27% reduction in the relative risk of 
death (and a reduction of 37% in patients with 
high-volume disease) with androgen-deprivation 
therapy plus docetaxel was observed after a 53.7- 
month follow-up (approximately 50% of deaths) 
in CHAARTED.6 In STAMPEDE, a significant 24% 
risk reduction in death was observed among pa-
tients with metastatic, castration-sensitive pros-
tate cancer.7 (The STAMPEDE investigators now 
report in the Journal the results of another trial 
of abiraterone plus prednisone in men with local-
ly advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.34) In 
our trial, the efficacy of abiraterone, with a 38% 
reduction in the risk of death among patients 
who had not received previous treatment for 
metastatic disease, compares favorably with pre-
vious findings. Of note, the early use of abira-
terone plus prednisone resulted in increased sur-
vival, even though more patients in the placebo 
group received life-prolonging treatments after 
progression.
The overall safety profile in the abiraterone 
group was consistent with those in previous stud-
ies involving patients with metastatic, castration-
resistant prostate cancer, with an anticipated 
elevated incidence of mineralocorticoid-related 
hypertension and hypokalemia. The incidence of 
grade 3 hypertension in the abiraterone group as 
compared with the placebo group (20% vs. 10%) 
was greater than that observed in previous stud-
ies of abiraterone involving patients with meta-
static, castration-resistant prostate cancer. How-
ever, this difference may be attributable to our 
use of stricter grading with version 4.0 of the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
The increased rate of hypertension in the abira-
terone group did not appear to have any serious 
sequelae; 2 patients in each group died of stroke, 
and 10 patients in the abiraterone group and 6 in 
the placebo group died of cardiac disorders. The 
incidence of hypokalemia was also higher than 
that reported in previous phase 3 studies of 
abiraterone involving patients with metastatic, 
castration-sensitive prostate cancer, but only 2 pa-
tients discontinued treatment because of hypo-
kalemia and there were no hypokalemia-related 
deaths. The apparent increase in mineralocorti-
coid-associated adverse events may reflect the 
fact that the prednisone dose used in our trial 
was lower than that used in previous studies of 
abiraterone (5 mg vs. 10 mg) but may also be 
related to the longer duration of abiraterone 
treatment in our trial than in previous trials (24 
months in the LATITUDE trial vs. 13.8 months 
in COU-AA-30222). The observed degrees of hyper-
tension and hypokalemia were both medically 
manageable, only rarely required treatment dis-
continuation, and seldom led to serious conse-
quences, all factors that point to the need for 
proper and timely management.
In conclusion, among men with newly diag-
nosed, metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate 
cancer, the addition of abiraterone plus predni-
sone to androgen-deprivation therapy was asso-
ciated with longer overall survival and longer 
radiographic progression-free survival than was 
androgen-deprivation therapy alone. Rates of 
grade 3 hypertension and hypokalemia were 
higher in the abiraterone group.
