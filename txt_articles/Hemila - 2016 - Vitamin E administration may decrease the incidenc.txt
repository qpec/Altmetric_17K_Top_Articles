Background: Vitamin E has influenced the immune system in laboratory studies. Dozens of 
animal experiments have found that vitamin E offered protection against infections caused by 
viruses and bacteria. Previously, significant heterogeneity was found in the effect of vitamin E 
supplementation on pneumonia in humans. The aim of this study was to examine how the effect 
of vitamin E on pneumonia risk depends on age.
Methods: Secondary analysis of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention study 
in Finland, 1985–1993, was performed. Participants were male smokers aged 50–69 years at the 
baseline who started to smoke at $21 years (N=7,469). Intervention was 50 mg/d of vitamin E 
for 5–8 years. The outcome was the incidence of hospital-treated, community-acquired pneu-
monia by the age at the follow-up.
Results: Among 2,216 participants who smoked 5–19 cigarettes per day at baseline and exer-
cised at leisure time, vitamin E supplementation reduced the incidence of pneumonia by 69% 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 43%–83%; 57 pneumonia cases). In this subgroup, vitamin E 
prevented pneumonia in 12.9% of participants by the age of 74 years. Among 5,253 participants 
who smoked $20 cigarettes per day at baseline or did not exercise, the incidence of pneumonia 
was 14% lower in the vitamin E participants (95% CI: -38% to +21%; 139 cases). One-third of 
the participants quit smoking for a period, of whom 27 got pneumonia. The incidence of pneu-
monia was 72% (95% CI: 31%–89%) lower in the vitamin E group, and this benefit was also 
seen among those males who smoked $20 cigarettes per day at baseline or did not exercise.
Conclusion: Although the evidence of benefit from vitamin E against pneumonia in elderly 
males is strong in this analysis, the overall findings about vitamin E have been complex. Further 
research on vitamin E in nonsmoking elderly males is warranted.

Introduction
Vitamin E has influenced the immune system in laboratory studies,1 and over three 
dozen animal studies have found that vitamin E offered protection against infections 
caused by viruses and bacteria.2 For human lower respiratory tract infections, the 
implications of the protection of mice against Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza 
virus with vitamin E are particularly relevant.3–6
The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) study examined 
the effect of 50 mg/d of vitamin E supplementation on male Finnish smokers.7 Age modi-
fied the effect of vitamin E on common cold incidence and total mortality. Vitamin E both 
increased and decreased common cold incidence in the subgroups of participants who 
were aged .65 years,8,9 and extended the life span over the whole ATBC cohort.10,11

In the ATBC study, the effect of vitamin E on the inci-
dence of pneumonia was significantly modified by the age 
at which the participant had started to smoke. Vitamin E 
supplementation decreased the risk of pneumonia by 35% 
in those who initiated smoking at a later age, at $21 years.12 
In addition, the level of smoking and leisure-time exercise 
modified the effect of vitamin E.2,12–14
The incidence of pneumonia substantially increases with 
age, and the effect of vitamin E supplementation may also 
vary with age. The goal of this study was to examine the age-
dependency of the vitamin E effect on pneumonia. This analysis 
was restricted to ATBC study participants who started to smoke 
at $21 years, in whom vitamin E protected against pneumonia. 
Because the ATBC study lasted for 5–8 years, the age of the 
participants substantially increased during the trial. Therefore, 
the effect of vitamin E was analyzed by the age of the participant 
during the follow-up and not by the age at the baseline.
Methods
Participants
The rationale, design, and methods of the ATBC study, to 
examine the effects of vitamin E (dl-α-tocopheryl acetate, 
AT, 50 mg/d) and β-carotene (BC, 20 mg/d) on the incidence 
of lung cancer and other cancers, as well as the primary find-
ings, have been described in detail previously.7,15 The ATBC 
study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00342992. 
In brief, males aged 50–69 years who smoked $5 cigarettes 
per day at entry (N=29,133) were randomized into one of 
four intervention arms, placebo, AT, BC, or AT + BC, 
according to a 2×2 factorial design. Vitamin E administra-
tion increased the mean serum levels of α-tocopherol by 
50% compared to baseline.7,15 The intervention continued 
for 5–8 years until April 1993. The trial was approved by 
the review boards of the participating institutions, and all 
participants gave their written informed consent.7 This 
study is a secondary analysis of the ATBC study data set 
and therefore no ethics approval was needed for this study. 
Compliance was high, with 90% of the subjects taking more 
than 90% of their prescribed capsules during their active 
participation in the trial.7,15 This analysis was restricted to 
7,469 participants who started smoking at $21 years, with 
21,664 participants being excluded because they started 
smoking at #20 years (N=21,657) or the age was not 
available (N=7).
Baseline characteristics and smoking 
during the follow-up
Before randomization, the participants completed question-
naires on their medical and smoking histories and general 
background characteristics.7,15 The baseline questionnaire 
inquired about the intensity of leisure-time physical activity 
in terms of the following three alternatives: 1) light: read-
ing, watching TV, listening to the radio, or going to movies; 
2) moderate: walking, fishing, hunting, or gardening quite 
regularly; and 3) heavy: actual physical exercise, such as 
jogging, skiing, swimming, gymnastics, and court and field 
sports quite regularly. Two participants had missing data for 
physical activity and so light physical activity was imputed 
for them. In the current analysis, “leisure-time exercise” 
combines positive responses to alternatives 2) and 3).
There were three follow-up visits annually (ie, at 4-month 
intervals). At each follow-up visit, the subject was asked, 
“Have you been smoking since the previous visit?” with the 
following alternative responses provided: 1) no; 2) yes, but 
now I have quit; and 3) yes, continuously. In this analysis, 
“quit smoking prior to a given follow-up visit” combines posi-
tive responses to alternatives 1) and 2). Of the 7,469 partici-
pants included in this study, 4,904 reported on each visit that 
they continued smoking, while 2,565 (34%) reported on one 
or more visits that they had quit after the preceding visit.
Outcomes and follow-up time
The primary outcome, the first hospital-treated case of pneu-
monia after randomization, was ascertained from the National 
Hospital Discharge Register using the volunteer’s unique 
personal identification number for linkage.12 Because almost 
all participants lived at home, the cases represented primarily 
community-acquired pneumonia. Medical records were not 
reviewed to rule out the few nosocomial cases.
The follow-up time began from the day of randomization 
and continued until the date of the first hospital discharge for 
pneumonia, death, or the end of the trial, whichever came first. 
There was a total of 43,314 person-years of observation (median 
follow-up of 6 years). Using the Hospital Discharge Register 
meant that information on pneumonia was obtained irrespective 
of whether the participant continued in the trial or not.
The secondary outcome was the occurrence of pneumonia 
after the participant had quit smoking. These cases were iden-
tified by determining whether the participant with pneumonia 
had reported that he had quit smoking at the visit immediately 
preceding the pneumonia, or if he did not participate in the pre-
ceding visit, whether he had quit smoking at the next previous 
visit. The follow-up time for the secondary outcome started 
from the visit preceding the first visit at which the participant 
stated that he had quit smoking and follow-up continued until 
the latest visit at which he stated that he had not smoked, or 
until pneumonia or death occurred (Supplementary material). 
Pneumonia occurred in 14 males before they quit smoking,

Vitamin e and the risk of pneumonia in males
and so they were excluded. For the secondary outcome, there 
was a total of 6,666 person-years of observation (median 
follow-up of 2.3 years among 2,551 males).
statistical methods
The participants to whom vitamin E alone or in combination 
with β-carotene were administered (AT and AT + BC) were 
compared with the no-vitamin E participants (placebo and 
BC). Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to 
estimate the relative effect of vitamin E on pneumonia inci-
dence. The risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval 
(CI) were calculated using the SAS PROC PHREG program 
(release 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The statistical 
significance of the interaction in Figure 1 was calculated from 
the change in -2× log (likelihood) when the interaction term 
was added to the Cox model. Kaplan–Meier curves were 
used to estimate the absolute effect of vitamin E; they were 
drawn using the survfit procedure of R.16
Results
The ATBC study enrolled Finnish males aged 50–69 years who 
smoked $5 cigarettes per day at the baseline; further demo-
graphic characteristics have already been published.7,12,13,15 
This analysis is restricted to 7,469 participants who started to 
smoke at $21 years. As the intervention lasted for 5–8 years, 
the oldest participants were up to 77 years of age at the end of 
the trial. Therefore, this analysis was performed by the age at 
the follow-up and not by the age at the baseline. This means 
that if a person aged 64.0 years at the baseline of the trial got 
pneumonia at 2.5 years after randomization, the age of the 
participant at the follow-up was 66.5 years when the case of 
pneumonia occurred. The age of the occurrence of pneumonia 
is indicated on the horizontal axis of the figures.
The participants were divided into groups A and B on 
the basis of the level of cigarette smoking and whether the 
participant did leisure-time exercise at the baseline (Table 1). 
A previous analysis found that vitamin E prevented pneu-
monia in group A.14
Among the 2,216 participants who smoked least, only 
5–19 cigarettes per day at the baseline, and exercised at leisure 
(group A), vitamin E reduced the incidence of pneumonia by 
RR: 0.31 (95% CI: 0.17–0.57; based on 14 vs 43 cases in the 
vitamin E and no-vitamin E groups, respectively) (Figure 1A). 
The effect was the same when restricted to the no-β-carotene 
participants (RR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12–0.76; six vs 19 cases). 
Among the 5,253 participants who smoked $20 cigarettes per 
day or did not exercise (group B), vitamin E had no overall 
effect, with RR: 0.86 (Figure 1B).
In Figure 1A, the relative effect of vitamin E applies to 
the entire follow-up age range. There was no difference in the 
vitamin E effect between the age ranges from 50 to 66 years 
(RR: 0.34; 30 cases) and from 67 years to older (RR: 0.29; 
27 cases). However, because the incidence of pneumonia 
substantially increases with age, this constant relative effect 
translates into an absolute effect that is substantially greater 
for the oldest participants. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves 
in Figure 1A indicate that by the age of 74 years, the cumula-
tive occurrence of pneumonia was 19.6% in the no-vitamin E 
group, but just 6.7% in the vitamin E group. This 12.9 per-
centage point difference indicates the cumulative proportion

Figure 1 effect of vitamin e supplementation on the incidence of pneumonia in ATBC study participants by age at the follow-up.
Notes: Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the vitamin e and no-vitamin e groups show (A) the 57 cases of pneumonia among 2,216 males who smoked 5–19 cigarettes per 
day and did leisure-time exercise at the baseline of the trial (group A), and (B) the 139 cases of pneumonia among 5,253 males who smoked $20 cigarettes per day or 
did not exercise (group B). each step indicates one case of pneumonia. In (A), for the difference between the two groups, rr: 0.31 (95% CI: 0.17–0.57; P=0.0002); in (B), 
 
rr: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.62–1.21; P=0.4). The interaction test between vitamin E effect and the two groups A and B is significant (χ2[1 df] =8.9; P=0.003). At the age of 70 years, 
there were 475 participants remaining in (A) and 738 in (B), and at the age of 74 years, there were 128 participants in (A) and 205 in (B).

of patients who remained without pneumonia because of 
vitamin E administration (Figure 2).
If the follow-up of the participants in group A is started 
at the age of 70 years, the effect of vitamin E is RR: 0.25 
(95% CI: 0.08–0.73; four vs 17 cases). This corresponds 
to preventing pneumonia in 7.8% of males by the age of 
 
74 years with vitamin E (Figure 2).
When subgroups of a randomized trial are formed, 
it is possible that the balance between the intervention 
groups is not maintained. However, groups A and B are 
large and there were no substantial differences between 
the vitamin E and no-vitamin E groups in relevant baseline 
variables (Supplementary material). Thus, imbalance in 
baseline variables does not explain the significant difference 
in pneumonia incidence in group A by vitamin E administra-
tion (Figure 1A).
Participants in the ATBC study were selected as smokers. 
Thus, no analysis can be performed on males who had never 
smoked. However, because 34% of the participants quit 
smoking for a period, the effect of vitamin E for nonsmoking 
males can be examined in this group. There were 27 partici-
pants who quit smoking before the occurrence of pneumonia, 
for whom the median duration of smoking cessation was 
 
2 years before pneumonia occurred. These cases give 
information about the effect of vitamin E on males who do 
not smoke currently. The incidence of pneumonia was sub-
stantially lower in the vitamin E group (RR: 0.28; 95% CI: 
0.11–0.69; six vs 21 cases). Figure 3 shows the secondary 
analysis by groups A and B.
In the nonsmoking males of group B, vitamin E decreased 
the occurrence of pneumonia by RR: 0.24 (Figure 3B). 
This finding is substantially different from Figure 1B, in 
which vitamin E had no overall effect. However, 69% of 
the participants in group B never reported an attempt to 
 
quit smoking on any follow-up visit, thus camouflaging 
the effect of vitamin E against pneumonia in males who 
had quit smoking (Figure 3B). If the 15 pneumonia cases 
that occurred among the nonsmoking males are removed 
from the analysis shown in Figure 1B, the 14% lower risk 
of pneumonia in vitamin E participants shrinks to 2% lower 
risk (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.7–1.4; 62 vs 62 cases), indicating 
a lack of benefit of vitamin E for current heavy smokers. 
There were no substantial differences between the vitamin E 
and no-vitamin E groups in relevant baseline variables in this 
secondary analysis (Supplementary material).
Because leisure-time exercise modified the effect of 
vitamin E supplementation,13,14 the participants who quit 
smoking were also divided into those who exercised and 
those who were sedentary (Table 2). Vitamin E supplementa-
tion significantly decreased the incidence of pneumonia with 
RR: 0.19 among participants who did leisure-time exercise 
at the baseline of the trial. Only nine cases of pneumonia 
occurred among sedentary participants, and the CI for the 
vitamin E effect is wide, covering both the null effect and the 
effect estimate for participants who exercised (Table 2).
Discussion
Because the ATBC study participants were selected as 
smokers, no analysis can be performed on a subgroup of

Figure 2 Proportion of participants without pneumonia because of vitamin e 
administration in group A.
Notes: Difference in the Kaplan–Meier estimates by vitamin e administration was 
calculated for group A and plotted by the follow-up age as the continuous line, 
with a difference of 12.9 percentage points at 74 years. The dashed line shows 
the cumulative percentage of males without pneumonia when the follow-up starts 
at 70 years (n=481; 21 cases of pneumonia): at the follow-up age of 74 years, the 
cumulative occurrence of pneumonia was 11.2% in the no-vitamin e group and 3.4% 
in the vitamin e group, with a difference of 7.8 percentage points.

Vitamin e and the risk of pneumonia in males
males who had never smoked. However, the level of exposure 
to cigarette smoking varied by several measures: the age the 
participants had initiated smoking, the number of cigarettes 
smoked daily at a baseline of a trial, and finally, a proportion 
of participants quit smoking for at least some time during 
the intervention (one-third), making them nonsmokers for 
a period. These variations make it possible to examine the 
modification of vitamin E effect on pneumonia by different 
measures of smoking exposure.
The current primary analysis was restricted to 7,469 
participants who started smoking at $21 years, as vitamin E 
caused an overall preventive effect in them.12 Within this 
subgroup, the level of smoking and leisure-time exercise 
modified the effect of vitamin E supplementation.12–14 The 
age-dependency of the vitamin E effect is an issue of great 
interest in this group.
Among participants who smoked least, 5–19 cigarettes 
per day, and undertook exercise at leisure at the baseline of 
the trial, vitamin E administration cumulatively prevented 
pneumonia in 13% of the participants by the age of 74 years 
(Figure 2). When the analysis was restricted to the age range 
above 70 years, vitamin E prevented pneumonia in 8% of 
participants by the age of 74 years. This indicates that one 
out of every 12.5 participants remained without pneumonia 
over the 4-year period because of vitamin E (number needed 
to treat is 12.5). Vitamin E did not cause an overall benefit 
in participants who either smoked $20 cigarettes per day at 
baseline or did not exercise (Figure 1B).
A secondary analysis focused on the effect of vitamin E on 
pneumonia while the participants did not smoke. Although vita-
min E did not influence the total incidence of pneumonia in group 
B (Figure 1B), vitamin E prevented pneumonia in those males 
of group B who quit smoking during the intervention period 
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, the 14% lower rate of pneumonia in 
the vitamin E participants of group B was fully explained by 
the males who had quit smoking. Finally, when the participants 
were divided by exercise, ignoring the level of smoking at the 
baseline, vitamin E decreased the incidence of pneumonia by 
81% among those males who did leisure-time exercise at the 
baseline of the ATBC study (Table 2). Among those who quit

Notes: Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the vitamin e and no-vitamin e groups show (A) the 12 cases of pneumonia among 953 males who quit smoking during the trial of 
those who smoked 5–19 cigarettes per day and did exercise (group A), and (B) the 15 cases of pneumonia among 1,598 males who quit smoking during the trial of those 
who smoked .=20 cigarettes per day or did not exercise (group B). each step indicates one case of pneumonia. In (A), for the difference between the two groups, rr: 0.31

smoking and were sedentary, the number of pneumonia cases 
was too low to allow unambiguous conclusions.
Although an early analysis calculated that vitamin E 
supplementation halved the risk of pneumonia in ATBC 
study participants who did leisure-time exercise,13 a subse-
quent analysis showed that the influence of exercise on the 
vitamin E effect depended on the age of smoking initiation 
and on the level of smoking at the baseline of the trial.14 
Exercise was associated with the benefit of vitamin E only if 
the participants had started to smoke at a late age and smoked 
least, shown as group A in Table 1. The previous analyses did 
not investigate the influence of age on the vitamin E effect. 
Because the incidence of pneumonia increases substantially 
with age, the effects of vitamin E against pneumonia might 
be practically important only for elderly people. The ATBC 
study enrolled patients who were $50 years; however, the 
current study showed that the effect of vitamin E on pneumo-
nia risk was substantial only when the participants were over 
60–65 years and insignificant for younger males (Figures 1A, 
2, and 3). A previous analysis of the ATBC study found that 
vitamin E supplementation influenced common cold risk 
substantially after about 65 years8 and mortality after about 
70 years.11 Thus, all the three outcomes indicate that the effect 
of vitamin E is greatest for oldest males.
The ATBC study is by far the largest study on vitamin E 
and respiratory infections. The earliest controlled trial on 
this topic included 103 participants who were followed for 
51 person-years,17 another included 652 participants followed 
for 788 person-years,18 and the third included 617 participants 
followed for 540 person-years.19 The main analysis of the cur-
rent study included 43,314 person-years of observation time 
(Figure 1), and even the secondary analysis restricted to males 
who quit smoking included 6,666 person-years of observa-
tion time. The ATBC study thus allows much more detailed 
analysis of factors that may modify the effect of vitamin E, 
including the age of the participants. Furthermore, the out-
come of the current study was pneumonia requiring treatment 
at the hospital, which means an illness that has substantially 
greater economic and disease impact than the mostly mild 
respiratory infections in two studies,18,19 while the lung infec-
tions in the earliest study were not properly described.17
As to the findings in the other intervention trials on respi-
ratory infections, Harman and Miller,17 found no differences 
between the vitamin E and placebo groups, Graat et al18 in 
their small study, found significant harm from vitamin E, 
and Meydani et al19 found a marginally significant benefit. 
In a recent cohort study of hospitalized pneumonia patients 
who were discharged, Neupane et al20 found that vitamin E 
self-supplementation was associated with a 63% lower rate 
of rehospitalization within 90 days; however, such a differ-
ence might result from residual confounding.
Vitamin E has been argued to be beneficial for the 
immune system,21 and the current study indicates benefit for 
elderly males who were least exposed to smoking at their 
youth and at their old age. However, there are also findings 
that indicate that vitamin E is deleterious for some groups. 
Large doses of vitamin E reduced the bactericidal activity 
of phagocytes in human subjects.22,23 In certain subgroups of 
the ATBC study, vitamin E significantly increased the risk of 
pneumonia,14,24 tuberculosis,25 the common cold,8,9 and even 
total mortality.10 As noted earlier, Graat et al18 reported 
that vitamin E significantly increased the severity and 
symptoms of respiratory infections, fever during infections, 
and the restriction of activity caused by the infections. The 
complexity of the effects of vitamin E that has been observed 
in the ATBC study and the harm found in some population 
groups indicate caution about drawing hasty generalized 
conclusions from the current findings. Finally, the partici-
pants of the ATBC study were mostly born in the 1920s and 
1930s, and lived through the World War II years. Thus, even 
though the 81% decrease in pneumonia risk with vitamin E in 
the nonsmoking elderly males who did leisure-time exercise 
may be a real effect (Table 2), it should not be generalized 
to current elderly males in Western countries.
Meta-analyses have concluded that, on average, vita-
min E does not decrease total mortality.26,27 However, meta-
analyses may suffer from ecological fallacy, which means 
that study-level analysis can produce different conclusions 
than corresponding individual-level analysis.28 Our previous 
individual-level analysis of total mortality in the ATBC study 
found highly significant heterogeneity in the effects of vitamin 
E, which challenges the validity of calculating a single estimate 
of effect in meta-analyses. In fact, vitamin E supplementation 
significantly decreased mortality in a subgroup of the ATBC 
study participants.10,11 Furthermore, meta-analyses of study-
level data do not often indicate what paths should be explored or 
the direction of further research. In contrast, the current analysis 
of individual-level data suggests that trials on vitamin E and 
pneumonia on nonsmoking elderly males are warranted.
Conclusion
There is strong evidence that the effect of vitamin E on pneu-
monia incidence was heterogeneous in the ATBC study.2,12,14,29 
Thus, the effects of vitamin E supplementation should be ana-
lyzed in selected subpopulations. Furthermore, the incidence 
of pneumonia increases with age and therefore the effects of 
vitamin E on pneumonia should be analyzed by age. The 72% 
decrease in the incidence of pneumonia in males who quit
