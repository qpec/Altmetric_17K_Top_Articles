Responses in the amiloride-insensitive (AI) pathway, one of the two pathways mediating salty taste in mammals, are modulated by the
size of the anion of a salt. This “anion effect” has been hypothesized to result from inhibitory transepithelial potentials (TPs) generated
across the lingual epithelium as cations permeate through tight junctions and leave their larger and less permeable anions behind (Ye et
al., 1991). We tested directly the necessity of TPs for the anion effect by measuring responses to NaCl and Na-gluconate (small and
large anion sodium salts, respectively) in isolated taste cells from mouse circumvallate papillae. Using calcium imaging, we identified AI
salt-responsivetypeIIItastecellsanddemonstratedthattheycomposeasubpopulationofacid-responsivetastecells.Evenintheabsence
of TPs, many (66%) AI salt-responsive type III taste cells still exhibited the anion effect, demonstrating that some component of the
transduction machinery for salty taste in type III cells is sensitive to anion size. We hypothesized that osmotic responses could explain
why a minority of type III cells (34%) had AI salt responses but lacked anion sensitivity. All AI type III cells had osmotic responses to
cellobiose, which were significantly modulated by extracellular sodium concentration, suggesting the presence of a sodium-conducting
osmotically sensitive ion channel. However, these responses were significantly larger in AI type III cells that did not exhibit the anion
effect. These findings indicate that multiple mechanisms could underlie AI salt responses in type III taste cells, one of which may
contribute to the anion effect.

Introduction
At least two pathways underlie salty taste in mammals. The
amiloride-sensitive (AS) pathway responds selectively to sodium
(and lithium) salts and is mediated by the epithelial sodium chan-
nel (Heck et al., 1984; Chandrashekar et al., 2010; Roper, 2015).
The amiloride-insensitive (AI), or high-salt pathway, responds to
a broad range of sodium and non-sodium salts (Ninomiya and
Funakoshi, 1988; Halpern, 1998), yet the underlying receptor(s)
remain unknown. TRPV1 receptor variants have been proposed
as AI salt receptor candidates (Lyall et al., 2004); however, high-
salt responses persist in mice lacking these channels, so their exact
role in salt taste remains unclear (Ruiz et al., 2006; Treesukosol et

Significance Statement
Understanding the mechanisms underlying salty taste will help inform strategies to combat the health problems associated with
NaCl overconsumption by humans. Of the two pathways underlying salty taste in mammals, the amiloride-insensitive (AI) path-
way is the least understood. Using calcium imaging of isolated mouse taste cells, we identify two separate populations of AI
salt-responsivetypeIIItastecellsdistinguishedbytheirsensitivitytoanionsizeandshowthatthesecellscomposesubpopulations

have important implications for general theories of taste encoding.

 al., 2007). AI salt responses have been reported in two distinct
populations of taste bud cells: (1) a subpopulation of bitter-
responsive type II taste cells; and (2) the polycystic kidney disease
2-like 1 (PKD2L1)-expressing type III taste cells critical for sour
taste (Oka et al., 2013). Because of the prevalence of cell-to-cell
communication in the taste bud (Roper, 2013), it is unclear to
what degree sour and AI salt responses co-occur in type III
taste cells.
Although the cation is typically considered the proximal stim-
ulus for salty taste, responses in the AI salt pathway (but not the
AS pathway) are significantly modulated by the anion. In the AI
salt pathway, larger anion salts produce smaller responses, a phe-
nomenon known as the “anion effect” (Beidler, 1967; Elliott and
Simon, 1990; Ye et al., 1991, 1993; Rehnberg et al., 1993; Kitada,
1995; Kitada et al., 1998). When the taste bud is exposed to a large
anion salt, smaller cations diffuse through tight junctions at the
taste pore, leaving their less permeable anions behind. This cre-
ates a transepithelial potential (TP) across the taste bud whose
magnitude is correlated with the size of the anion of a salt (Ye et
al., 1991, 1993). One theory to explain the anion effect hypothe-
sizes that these TPs act as inhibitory field potentials, either di-
rectly inhibiting taste cell depolarization in response to salt
stimuli or else inhibiting the diffusion of cations to the basolateral
membrane of taste cells where the currently unidentified AI salt
receptor(s) could be expressed (Elliott and Simon, 1990; Ye et al.,
1991, 1993).
To gain insight into the nature of AI salt taste, we recorded
calcium responses from AI salt-responsive taste cells in an iso-
lated taste cell preparation. Recording from isolated taste cells
removes any possible influence of TPs or cell-to-cell communi-
cation on taste cell responses. AI salt responses were observed in
a subset of acid-responsive type III taste cells. A majority of iso-
lated AI salt-responsive type III taste cells exhibited the anion
effect, indicating that some component of the transduction ma-
chinery housed within these AI salt taste cells is either inhibited
by larger anions or else requires smaller anions to function effi-
ciently. We also found that a sodium-conducting osmotically
sensitive channel may underlie salt responses in AI type III cells
that do not exhibit the anion effect.
Materials and Methods
Reagents and solutions
Calcium-free Tyrode’s solution was composed of the following (in mM):
140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 1 Na-pyruvate, and 2 EGTA, pH
7.4. Low-NaCl Tyrode’s solution, used as the bath solution during cal-
cium imaging, was composed of the following (in mM): 30 NaCl, 110
N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG)-Cl (Sigma), 5 KCl, 4 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2,
10 HEPES, 10 glucose, and 1 Na-pyruvate, pH 7.4. The 50 mM KCl and 50
mM citric acid stimuli were dissolved in low-NaCl Tyrode’s with an
equimolar substitution of KCl or citric acid for NMDG. NaCl and Na-
gluconate test solutions were made by completely replacing the NaCl and
NMDG normally found in Tyrode’s solution with the indicated concen-
tration of NaCl and/or Na-gluconate. Other tastants and pharmacolog-
ical agents were dissolved directly into the indicated buffer or stimulus.
The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH or HCl, except
for 50 mM citric acid, which was adjusted to pH 4. Reagents were obtained
from Thermo Fisher Scientific unless otherwise noted.
Isolated taste cell preparation
All experimental procedures were approved by the Monell Animal Care
and Use Committee. Following National Institute of Health recom-
mended procedures, adult male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laborato-
ries) were killed by exposure to CO2, followed by cervical dislocation.
The tongue was excised and washed briefly in cold DMEM (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) before a protease mixture consisting of 1 mg/ml colla-
genase, type IV (Worthington), 2 mg/ml dispase II (Sigma), and 1 mg/ml
trypsin inhibitor, soybean purified (Worthington) dissolved in calcium-
free Tyrode’s solution was injected under the lingual epithelium. After a
12 min incubation at 37°C, the lingual epithelium was peeled and then
washed with and incubated in Ca 2�-free Tyrode’s solution for 30 min at
room temperature. Isolated taste cells from the circumvallate papillae
(CV) were collected using pulled glass pipettes (DMZ-Universal Puller;
Zeitz Instruments) and expelled onto Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences)-coated
coverslips. Immediately before cell collection, the Ca 2�-free Tyrode’s
solution was replaced with DMEM. Cells were allowed at least 60 min to
settle onto the coverslips before functional imaging. Taste cells from CV
taste buds were used in this study because they contain a higher number
of type III taste cells relative to fungiform taste buds (Vandenbeuch et al.,
2008) and they do not exhibit AS salt responses (Formaker and Hill,
1991; Kitada et al., 1998; Ninomiya, 1998).
Calcium imaging
Isolated taste cells were transferred to an imaging chamber (RC-26; War-
ner Instruments) and loaded with fura-2 AM (6.5 �M; Invitrogen) con-
taining the dispersing agent Pluronic F-127 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at
37°C. Calcium imaging was conducted using an Olympus BX51-WI up-
right fixed-stage microscope (Olympus America) and associated Meta-
Fluor for Olympus control software in conjunction with a Hamamatsu
C9100 digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) and Sutter Instruments
Lambda 10-2 optical control system. During experiments, cells were kept
under constant perfusion. Stimuli were perfused inline using a two-
position microelectric actuator (Valco Instruments). The time from the
beginning of stimulus exposure to the conclusion of stimulus washout
was �20 s; this includes �5 s for the stimulus to replace the bath solution,
10 s during which the cells were exposed to the full concentration of a
stimulus, and �5 s for the bath solution to wash out the stimulus. Cells
were given at least 8 min of recovery time between stimuli. Fura-2 cal-
cium signals were measured at a capture rate of 2 s during stimulus
presentations, with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emis-
sion measured at 510 nm. To reduce cellular exposure to ultraviolet light
and photobleaching of the fura-2 fluorophore, the sampling rate was
reduced (4–8 s) during the prolonged and approximately linear recovery
phase of calcium responses and further reduced (10–45 s) during base-
line periods between stimuli. Calcium levels were estimated using the
ratio of fluorescent intensities at 340/380 nm. In experiments character-
izing responses in putative AI type III taste cells, cell responsiveness was
monitored by occasional application of a 250 mM NaCl or 250 mM NaCl
plus 100 �M amiloride stimulus; only data from stimuli presented when
cells were showing robust and consistent NaCl responses are included.
Data from cells with baseline calcium levels that fluctuated by �5% of
their peak magnitude response to 250 mM NaCl were discarded. Peak
magnitude response was defined as the maximum F340/380nm value after
stimulus presentation minus the average baseline value in the 120 s be-
fore stimulus presentation. Occasionally, cells would experience small
shifts in steady-state intracellular calcium levels after stimulation (usu-
ally after the first stimulus presented). Data from stimuli presented after
a change in resting calcium levels of �5% of the cells peak magnitude
response to 250 mM NaCl were discarded. For the bitter-responsive cells
and sour-only responsive cells that did not respond to 250 mM NaCl, we
used the peak magnitude of the response to the bitter tastant mix (10 mM
denatonium plus 0.5 mM cycloheximide) or the 50 mM citric acid stimu-
lus, respectively.
In initial experiments, putative AI salt-responsive type III cells were
identified based on responses to 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM NaCl plus 100 �M
amiloride, and 50 mM KCl. All taste cells in these experiments that re-
sponded to 250 mM NaCl also responded to 250 mM NaCl plus 100 �M
amiloride and 50 mM KCl. Furthermore, all cells that responded to 250
mM NaCl also responded to 50 mM citric acid, pH 4, when tested (see
Fig. 2). Thus, in subsequent experiments focused on the anion effect (see
Fig. 3) and osmotic responses (see Fig. 4) in which larger numbers of
stimuli needed to be tested, a response to 250 mM NaCl and at least one of
the stimuli mentioned above (250 mM NaCl plus 100 �M amiloride, 50
mM KCl, or 50 mM citric acid, pH 4) was used as a minimal criteria for
physiological identification of AI salt-responsive type III taste cells.

 Single-cell RT-PCR
Cells identified by calcium imaging were collected by aspiration using a
microcapillary attached to a microinjection device (CellTram Oil, cata-
log #5176 000 025; Eppendorf) positioned using a Sutter Instruments
MP-285 motorized micromanipulator. Collected cells were expelled into
PCR tubes containing 2 �l of QuickExtract RNA Extraction Solution
(catalog #QER09015; Epicenter), immediately flash frozen in a mixture
of dry ice and ethanol, and stored at �80°C. Single-cell RNA amplifica-
tion was conducted using the TargetAmp 2-Round aRNA (antisense
RNA) Amplification Kit 2.0 (catalog #TAU2R51224; Epicenter) follow-
ing the kit protocol with a modification: aRNA was purified after the first
and second rounds of in vitro transcription using the RNA Clean &
Concentrator 5 kit (catalog #R1015; Zymo Research). The aRNA was
used for RNA-Sequencing library preparation using the NEBNext
mRNA library prep master mix set for Illumina following the kit protocol
with a modification: 500 ng of aRNA was used as input, and RNA frag-
mentation was done for 2 min at 94°C. The sequencing library was di-
luted 10-fold, and 1 �l was used as template for end-point PCR using
previously established methods (Yee et al., 2011) with primer sequences
detailed in Table 1.
Calcium imaging data analysis
Initial data analysis was conducted using custom scripts written in
MATLAB (MathWorks). The magnitude of response to a given stimulus
was quantified by comparing the average calcium signal 90 s after the
onset of stimulus presentation to the average baseline signal in the 120 s
before the onset of stimulus presentation (�F � Fresponse � Fbaseline).
Fluorescence is reported in arbitrary units (AUs). A larger window is
used to calculate the average baseline signal to compensate for dynamic
adjustments in capture rate during experiments (described above). Cal-
cium signals for baseline and response periods were quantified using the
average area under the curve as a metric. Average area under the curve
was calculated using a trapezoidal approximation: FAvg � ((b � a)/2n) �
[f(x0) � 2f(x1) � … � 2f(xn�1) � f(xn)], where n is the number of data
points between times a and b. In analyses in which data are compared
across cells, stimulus-induced responses in a given cell were normalized
to the average magnitude of the 250 mM NaCl response of that cell. An
evoked response to a stimulus was considered significant if the calcium
signal after stimulus presentation remained �10 SDs above the baseline
average for 10 s consecutively. Statistical analyses to compare respo-
nse magnitudes, time-to-peak measurements, and response durations
were conducted using Student’s t tests, two-tailed. Paired Student’s t tests
were used when possible. However, many cells could only be tested with
a subset of the total stimuli. Statistical analyses for stimuli tested in only
partially overlapping subsets of cells were conducted using two-sample
Student’s t tests assuming unequal variance. When average values are
reported, SEM is included.
Time-to-peak response was defined as the time from the onset of
stimulus perfusion until the maximum value of the calcium response.
Response duration was defined as the time from the onset of stimulus
perfusion until the calcium response dropped below a threshold of 10%
of the peak response to the stimulus (relative to baseline): Response
duration threshold � Fbaseline � 0.1 � (Fpeak response � Fbaseline). Baseline
values were calculated as described above. Cell response data for each
stimulus were inspected visually for any artifacts that might interfere
with peak response or duration measurements.
Average response plots. For each presentation of a given stimulus, data
from 120 s before and 600 s after stimulus presentation were extracted
and scaled by first subtracting the average baseline F340/380 value (calcu-
lated from the 120 s before stimulus presentation) from each data point
and then dividing all data points by the peak response value (measured
from the 600 s after stimulus presentation). These scaled data for each
stimulus were then binned to enable averaging across all stimulus pre-
sentations. Bin sizes were adjusted to reflect the average capture rate
during different time periods surrounding stimulus presentation and the
properties of the response being averaged. When multiple data points
from a single stimulus presentation fell into the same bin, the average
value was taken. Average response plots were then created by calculating
the average � SEM value for each individual bin.
Test for unimodal versus bimodal distribution. To test whether data are
better fit by a unimodal normal distribution or a bimodal normal distri-
bution, we fit the data with a normal model (mean � and variance � 2)
and a mixture normal model (mean �1 and variance �1
2 and proportion �
for the first model; mean �2 and variance �2
2 and proportion 1 � � for the
second model). The normal model (unimodal distribution) was fit using
the maximum likelihood method. The mixture normal model provi-
des a flexible bimodal distribution and was fit by the expectation-
maximization algorithm. For estimation of bimodal normal models, the
variances of the two components were estimated separately because they
may be unequal. The tests of fitting of both models were implemented by
the publically available NOCOM program (Ott, 1992). Hypothesis test-
ing (H0, unimodal normal model vs Ha, mixture normal model) was
performed by comparing nested models using likelihood ratio tests to
select a best-fitting model. In this study, results for bimodal models are
based on mixture normal model distributions with unequal variances for
two normal components, and p values are based on a � 2 distribution with
6 df (McLachlan, 1987; Gutierrez et al., 1995).
Results
Identification of salt-responsive AI taste cells in isolated taste
cell preparations
The major goal of these experiments was to test the hypothesis
that the anion effect is caused by negative TPs generated ac-
ross the taste bud by the differential permeability of tight junc-
tions at the taste pore to anions and cations (Ye et al., 1991, 1993).
To test this hypothesis, we used an isolated taste cell preparation
of mouse CV taste cells to remove any influence of TPs on taste
cell responses. Our first step was to confirm that we could reliably
identify our target population of AI salt-responsive type III taste
cells (hereafter abbreviated as AI type III taste cells). Using fura-2
functional calcium imaging, we identified cells that gave calcium
responses to salt (250 mM NaCl), did not exhibit amiloride inhi-
bition (250 mM NaCl plus 100 �M amiloride), and responded to
depolarization with 50 mM KCl (a physiological identifier of type
III cells in isolated preparations; DeFazio et al., 2006; Fig. 1A,B).
To prevent any potential desensitization of salt transduction
pathways, the bath solution used during recording of isolated
taste cell responses was a low-NaCl modification of Tyrode’s so-
lution, in which an equimolar substitution of NMDG-Cl for
NaCl was used to bring the NaCl concentration down to 30 mM.
None of the taste cells we recorded from exhibited AS salt
responses. This agrees with previous studies in mice that find
no evidence of AS taste cells in CV taste buds (Chandrashekar
et al., 2010) and no AS component to salt responses in the
glossopharyngeal nerve that innervates the CV taste buds (Ni-
nomiya, 1998).

Lewandowski et al. • Two Populations of Salt-Responsive Type III Cells
 AI salt taste responses have been described in two distinct
populations of taste cells: (1) the PKD2L1-expressing type III
taste cells also known to include acid-responsive taste cells
(Huang et al., 2006; Oka et al., 2013); and (2) a subpopulation of
bitter-responsive type II taste cells (Oka et al., 2013). It might be
expected that the latter population (bitter/salt-responsive type II
cells) would respond to the same salt stimuli being used to phys-
iologically identify AI type III taste cells. To determine whether
we could distinguish between AI salt responses in type II versus
type III taste cells, we used a bitter tastant mix (10 mM denato-
nium plus 0.5 mM cycloheximide) to identify bitter-responsive
(type II) taste cells and then tested their responses to 250 mM
NaCl and 50 mM KCl (Fig. 1C,D). Of 12 bitter-responsive taste
cells, four gave significant responses to KCl, which agrees well
with similar experiments in isolated taste cells (Hacker et al.,
2008). However, no responses to 250 mM NaCl were observed in
any of the bitter-responsive taste cells. This would seem to con-
tradict reports of NaCl and KCl responses in some bitter taste
cells (Oka et al., 2013); however, bitter/salt-responsive taste cells
are not well characterized, and it is possible that they require
higher concentrations of NaCl to induce responses or they may
be rare or absent in CV taste buds. It is also
possible that some of these cells are bitter-
responsive type III taste cells (Hacker et
al., 2008). However, our results do suggest
that responses to 250 mM NaCl can be
used to reliably distinguish between AI
type III and AI type II taste cells isolated
from CV taste buds. This conclusion is
further supported by the ability of dorzo-
lamide, a broad-spectrum carbonic anhy-
drase inhibitor, to inhibit salt responses in
physiologically identified AI type III taste
cells (Fig. 1E). Previous studies have
shown that dorzolamide inhibits AI salt
responses in type III but not type II taste
cells (Oka et al., 2013).
As a final confirmation that our stim-
ulus set could reliably identify AI type III
cells, we examined gene expression in
these cells using single-cell RT-PCR (Fig.
1F). Six cells physiologically identified as
type III AI salt-responsive taste cells based
on significant responses to 250 mM NaCl,
250 mM NaCl plus 100 �M amiloride, and
50 mM KCl were collected and assayed for
expression of taste cell marker genes. In

PKD2L1, NCAM, and SNAP25 (Takeda et
al., 1992; Nelson and Finger, 1993; Yee et
al., 2001; Yang et al., 2004; DeFazio et al.,
2006; Huang et al., 2006) was detected in
all or most of the collected cells. Note that
single-cell RT-PCR is prone to false nega-
tives (Eberwine and Bartfai, 2011) be-
cause of the extremely small amount of
mRNA present in a single cell. Impor-
tantly, expression of the type II cell
marker PLC�2 (Clapp et al., 2004; DeFa-
zio et al., 2006) and type I cell marker glu-
tamate–aspartate
transporter
(GLAST;
Lawton et al., 2000) was not detected in
any of the physiologically identified AI type III cells.
AI salt responses occur in a subset of acid-responsive type III
taste cells
Multiple lines of evidence have shown that type III cells transduce
both AI salt responses and sour responses (Huang et al., 2006;
Huang et al., 2008; Tomchik et al., 2007; Yoshida et al., 2009a;
Oka et al., 2013). However, no studies have yet resolved whether
the salty and sour responses observed in type III taste cells arise
from two distinct populations of cells or whether receptors for
sour and salty taste are coexpressed in the same type III cells.
Much of the difficulty in resolving this question arises from the
prevalence of cell-to-cell communication in the intact taste bud,
which makes it difficult to determine whether the response of a
taste cell to a tastant is attributable to the tastant interacting with
receptors/channels expressed by the cell itself or whether the cell
is being activated indirectly through cell-to-cell communication
(Caicedo et al., 2002; Tomchik et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009;
Roper, 2013). This difficulty is of particular concern for type III
taste cells, which commonly respond to multiple taste qualities,
including sweet, bitter, and umami (Tomchik et al., 2007), de-

 spite not expressing receptors for those taste qualities (Adler et
al., 2000; Chandrashekar et al., 2000; Matsunami et al., 2000;
Nelson et al., 2001, 2002; Li et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003). To
resolve the uncertainties regarding the distribution of sour and
salty taste responses in type III taste cells, we removed the con-
founds caused by cell-to-cell communication by measuring taste
responses in isolated taste cells.
Isolated taste cells were tested for responses to NaCl (250 mM),
citric acid (50 mM, pH 4), and KCl (50 mM) and/or NaCl (250
mM) plus 100 �M amiloride (Fig. 2). The total number of stimuli
used to identify AI type III taste cells was reduced in these exper-
iments. AI type III taste cells were identified based on responses to
NaCl and NaCl plus amiloride (n � 23), NaCl and KCl (n � 3), or
NaCl, NaCl plus amiloride, and KCl (n � 5). All 31 AI type III
taste cells responded robustly to citric acid (AI type III cells, 31 of
55 cells; Fig. 2A). An additional 24 cells responded to citric acid
and KCl depolarization but not to NaCl (sour-only type III cells,
24 of 55 cells; Fig. 2B). No cells were observed that responded to
NaCl but not to citric acid, indicating that AI salt responses are
found in a subset of sour-responsive taste cells (Fig. 2C). All taste
cells that responded to citric acid also responded to KCl depolar-
ization when tested. Note that the sour-only population of taste
cells is almost certainly underrepresented in this dataset because
the presence of a NaCl-responsive cell was used frequently as a
criterion for selecting a recording site. However, this bias would
only strengthen the conclusion that AI salt responses appear to be
restricted to a subpopulation of sour-responsive type III cells. A
small number of cells were also tested for responses to 5 and/or 10
mM citric acid, pH 4. Both NaCl-responsive taste cells (n � 4) and
sour-only taste cells (n � 7) gave robust responses to these lower
concentrations of citric acid (data not shown). Given that previ-
ous studies have demonstrated that sour responses are restricted
to type III taste cells (Zhang et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2006, 2008;
Oka et al., 2013), the fact that all NaCl-responsive cells in these
experiments also responded to citric acid when tested provides
additional support that the NaCl-responsive taste cells identified
in these and subsequent experiments are type III taste cells. Fur-
thermore, the presence of both sour and AI salty responses in the
same type III taste cells fits well with results from previous studies
showing that AI salt responses are generally carried by acid/elec-
trolyte generalist E-type neurons in gustatory nerves (Frank et al.,
2008).
The onset and time course of citric acid responses were
distinctly different from NaCl and KCl responses (Fig. 2D). Both
time-to-peak response (29 � 1.4 s NaCl; 143.2 � 19.5 s citric acid;
two-sample Student’s t test, p � 3.5E-06) and response duration
(251.1 � 13.2 s NaCl; 425.3 � 55.5 s citric acid; two-sample
Student’s t test, p � 0.0083) were significantly longer for citric
acid than for NaCl. NaCl responses in these taste cells were char-
acterized by fast onsets with sharp peaks, while citric acid re-
sponses were characterized by slower onsets and a gradual rise to
peak response. These response durations are longer than those
observed in intact taste buds (Richter et al., 2003; Chandrashekar
et al., 2010; Oka et al., 2013), most likely because of the absence of
negative feedback pathways and support cells (Roper, 2013). The
double peak in citric acid responses that can be seen in Figure 2, A
and B, was observed occasionally, but a single broad peak was
more common, as suggested by the average citric acid response
Figure2.

 curve (Fig. 2D). The observed differences in the shape and time
course of salt and sour responses suggest that at least the initial
steps of the transduction pathways for salty and sour taste in type
III cells are different. This would be one of the first observations
in mammals of separate transduction pathways for two different
taste qualities coexpressed in the same taste cell. In Drosophila,
fatty acid responses may co-occur with sweet and/or umami re-
sponses in some taste cells and use separate transduction path-
ways (Masek and Keene, 2013). Bitter and AI salt responses
reported in type II cells appear to use the same G-protein-
coupled receptor-based transduction pathway (Oka et al., 2013),
as do the sweet and umami responses reported recently in indi-
vidual taste cells (Kusuhara et al., 2013).
Isolated AI taste cells can exhibit the anion effect
In the AI salt taste pathway, the magnitude of recorded responses
to sodium salts is inversely proportional to the size of the anion of
the salt. This anion effect has been hypothesized to result from
inhibitory TPs generated by accumulation of less permeable an-
ions at the tight junctions of taste buds (Elliott and Simon, 1990;
Ye et al., 1991, 1993). A major goal of these experiments was to
test directly the importance of TPs and, more generally, the struc-
ture of the intact taste bud, for generating the anion effect. We
removed any potential influence of TPs by measuring responses
to sodium salts in isolated AI type III taste cells. If the structure of
the intact taste bud is necessary for the anion effect, then isolated
AI type III taste cells should respond equally well to different
sodium salts regardless of their associated anion.
We tested for the presence of the anion effect in isolated AI
type III cells by comparing calcium responses to 250 mM NaCl (a
small-anion sodium salt) and 250 mM Na-gluconate (a large-
anion sodium salt known to induce a robust anion effect; Ye et al.,
1991). The majority of isolated AI type III taste cells (38 of 58
cells, 66%) had calcium responses to Na-gluconate that were
�70% the magnitude of responses to NaCl (Figs. 2A, 3A). It is
clear from these data that isolated taste cells are capable of exhib-
iting the anion effect. This indicates that at least part of the re-
duced response to salts with larger anions observed in the AI salt
taste pathway can be attributed to the transduction mechanism
itself.
A significant fraction of the cells tested (20 of 58, 34%) did not
appear to exhibit the anion effect (Fig. 3B). To enable compari-
sons across cells, the calcium responses of each cell were normal-
ized to its average 250 mM NaCl response. A comparison of the
relative magnitude of Na-gluconate responses across cells ap-
peared to show a bimodal distribution, suggesting that AI type III
taste cells may be divided into two functional groups based on
whether or not they exhibit the anion effect (Fig. 3C). To test this,
we fit the distribution of normalized Na-gluconate responses
with a unimodal model (mean � SD, 0.62 � 0.31) and found that
it deviated significantly from a theoretical normal distribution
(p � 0.02, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). A model using two nor-
mal distributions to describe the data (a bimodal normal model
with mean � SD of 0.42 � 0.14 for the first distribution and
0.98 � 0.18 for the second distribution) was a significantly better
fit to the experimental data than the unimodal normal model
(p � 0.016, � 2 test; see Materials and Methods).
To test whether differences in anion sensitivity correlated with
differences in responses to other stimuli, we divided AI type III
cells into two groups based on the distribution of responses in
Figure 3C: cells with an anion effect (AE� cells, normalized
Na-gluconate response �0.7) and cells without an anion effect
(AE� cells, normalized Na-gluconate response �0.7). Given that
the AS salt taste pathway does not exhibit an anion effect (Rehn-
berg et al., 1993; Ye et al., 1993; Breza and Contreras, 2012), we
wanted to test whether previous analyses combining AE� and
AE� cells may have masked some small level of amiloride sensi-
tivity in AE� cells. A comparison of responses to NaCl plus
amiloride in AE� versus AE� cells (Fig. 3D) revealed no indica-
tions of amiloride sensitivity in either group (normalized re-
sponse, 0.91 � 0.04 AE� cells, n � 25; 0.92 � 0.07 AE� cells, n �
11; two-sample Student’s t test, p � 0.96). We also tested whether
K-gluconate would elicit an anion effect in isolated taste cells. K �
salts directly depolarize isolated taste cells by reversing the elec-
trochemical gradient for K �. Thus, KCl and K-gluconate would
be expected to depolarize isolated taste cells without requiring
activation of the AI salt receptor. If isolated taste cells exhibited
reduced responses to K-gluconate relative to KCl, it would sug-
gest that larger anions are actively inhibiting the voltage-gated
calcium channels involved in AI salt responses (Medler et al.,
2003; DeFazio et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2009). A comparison of
responses to 50 mM KCl and 50 mM K-gluconate revealed no
differences (normalized responses, AE� cells, n � 2; KCl, 3.59 �
0.55; K-gluconate, 3.81 � 0.69; AE� cells, n � 3; KCl, 3.65 �
0.56; K-gluconate, 3.60 � 0.63). These data suggest that direct
depolarization bypasses the elements of the AI salt-response
transduction cascade that are sensitive to anion size.
We also wanted to test whether the raw magnitude of calcium
responses in a cell was associated with whether that cell exhibited
the anion effect. Although differences in the raw magnitude of
fluorescent responses could be associated with nonphysiological
variables, such as batch-to-batch variability in the solutions used
or variability in fluorescent dye loading, it is also possible that
these differences are tied to physiological properties of the cells
themselves. There is also the practical concern that small-
magnitude responses to NaCl could interfere with our ability to
detect a decrease in response to Na-gluconate. The average raw
magnitude of 250 mM NaCl responses in AE� cells (0.181 �
0.028 �F340nm/380nm, n � 38) tended to be higher than in AE�
cells (0.120 � 0.015 �F340nm/380nm, n � 20), but this difference
did not reach significance (two-sample Student’s t test, p � 0.06).
The average 250 mM NaCl response value for AE� cells is some-
what inflated by three cells that gave unusually large responses
(Fig. 4A includes data from one of these cells). There was signif-
icant overlap in the distribution of 250 mM NaCl response mag-
nitudes in AE� and AE� cells; of the 10 cells with the smallest
magnitude responses to 250 mM NaCl, six were AE� and four
were AE� cells. Most importantly, despite a tendency towards
larger average raw responses to 250 mM NaCl in AE� cells, the
average raw response to 250 mM Na-gluconate was significantly
lower in AE� cells (0.073 � 0.011 �F340nm/380nm, n � 38) than in
AE� cells (0.120 � 0.016 �F340nm/380nm, n � 20; p � 0.02, two-
sample Student’s t test). This demonstrates that the raw magni-
tude of responses to 250 mM NaCl in AE� cells would not impede
our ability to detect an anion effect in these cells.
We also compared the time course of NaCl and Na-gluconate
responses in AE� and AE� cells. In AE� cells (Fig. 3E), intra-
cellular calcium levels increased at a similar rate during NaCl and
Na-gluconate responses. The smaller magnitude of Na-gluconate
responses in AE� cells appeared to result from the rising phase
peaking at a significantly earlier time than is seen for NaCl re-
sponses (time-to-peak, 17.8 � 1.5 s Na-gluconate; 28.5 � 1.7 s
NaCl; paired Student’s t test, p � 9.0E-06). Interestingly, in AE�
cells, the time-to-peak response was also significantly faster for
Na-gluconate than for NaCl (Fig. 3F; time-to-peak, 20.2 � 1.6 s
Na-gluconate; 29.8 � 2.4 s NaCl; paired Student’s t test, p �

 0.00013). Although the peak magnitude was similar for NaCl and
Na-gluconate in AE� cells, the rising phase of Na-gluconate re-
sponses was steeper than that of NaCl responses. It is unclear why
Na-gluconate responses have faster kinetics than NaCl responses
in AE� cells and whether a similar difference would be observed
in the intact taste bud.
Relationship between osmotic responses and AI
salt responses
The range of anion sensitivity observed in isolated AI type III taste
cells suggests that at least two different pathways, one sensitive to
anion size and one insensitive to anion size, are contributing to
salt stimulus responses in these cells. Given the wide range of both
monovalent and divalent salts reported to activate the AI salt
pathway (Kitada, 1995; Kloub et al., 1998), it would not be sur-
prising if multiple transduction mechanisms contributed to AI
salty taste responses in type III cells. We hypothesized that one of
these transduction mechanisms may involve osmosensing be-
cause AI salt responses require relatively high concentrations of
salt (compared with the AS salt pathway; Chandrashekar et al.,
2010), which, like the 250 mM salt stimuli used in these experi-
ments, are often hypertonic relative to saliva and thus have the
potential to act as both a salty taste stimulus and an osmotic
stimulus. Interactions between salt taste responses and osmolar-
ity have been observed in the AS salt pathway, but whether osmo-
larity has similar effects on AI salt responses remains unclear

 (Lyall et al., 1999). We further hypothesized that the expression
of an osmotically sensitive channel that is not sensitive to anion
size could explain why some AI type III cells (AE� cells) do not
exhibit the anion effect.
To test the osmotic sensitivity of isolated AI type III taste cells,
we used the disaccharide cellobiose to create stimuli approximat-
ing the osmolarity of the 250 mM NaCl (565 � 2 mmol/kg) and

J. Neurosci., February 10, 2016 • 36(6):1942–1953 • 1949
 1999). To avoid desensitizing salt-response pathways, the bath
solution used for all isolated taste cell experiments was a low-
NaCl (30 mM NaCl and 110 mM NMDG-Cl) version of Tyrode’s
solution (see Materials and Methods). We first tested osmotic
responses using 220 mM cellobiose dissolved in the low-NaCl
Tyrode’s bath solution (588 � 9 mmol/kg). Calcium responses to
the osmotic stimulus in this low-NaCl (30 mM) background were
very weak in both AE� (n � 5) and AE� (n � 8) cells and did not
differ significantly between these two cell populations (Fig. 4A–C;
two-sample Student’s t test, p � 0.20). Although information on
the mechanisms underlying hyperosmotic responses is limited,
many osmotic responses are mediated by ion channels (Ciura and
Bourque, 2006; Sharif Naeini et al., 2006; Ciura et al., 2011; Jin et
al., 2011). To maintain ionic balance in our low-NaCl Tyrode’s
bath solution, we used an equimolar substitution of NMDG-Cl
for NaCl. NMDG � is a large and relatively inert cation that is
incapable of passing through most ion channels. Therefore, we
hypothesized that a lack of suitable cations (i.e., Na �) could ex-
plain the weak osmotic responses we observed in the low-NaCl
(30 mM) background. To test this, we created an osmotic stimu-
lus in a higher NaCl background by dissolving 220 mM cellobiose
in standard Tyrode’s solution (140 mM NaCl and 0 mM NMDG-
Cl; 599 � 5 mmol/kg). Calcium responses to the osmotic stimu-
lus in this higher NaCl background were significantly larger than
responses to the osmotic stimulus in a low-NaCl background
(cellobiose in 30 mM NaCl background vs 140 mM NaCl back-
ground; two-sample Student’s t test: AE� cells, p � 0.023; AE�
cells, p � 0.0059; n values indicated in Fig. 4C). To confirm that
these responses were osmotic in nature and not simply responses
to the increased concentration of NaCl, we also measured re-
sponses to 140 mM NaCl Tyrode’s solution itself. In both AE�
and AE� cells, responses to 140 mM NaCl were weak and signif-
icantly smaller than responses to the 140 mM NaCl plus osmotic
stimulus (AE� cells, paired Student’s t test, p � 0.014, n � 6;
AE� cells, two-sample Student’s t test, p � 0.0014, n values in-
dicated in Fig. 4C). The presence of osmotic responses and their
dependence on sodium strongly suggests that AI type III cells
express a sodium-conducting, osmotically sensitive ion channel.
Having established that AI type III cells can exhibit strong
osmotic responses, we tested our original hypothesis—that os-
motic responses could underlie the lack of an anion effect in some
AI type III taste cells—by comparing the magnitude of osmotic
responses in AE� and AE� cells. As predicted, AI type III cells
that do not exhibit anion sensitivity (AE� cells) had significantly
larger osmotic responses than AE� cells [140 mM NaCl plus
cellobiose in AE� (n � 13) vs AE� (n � 9) cells, two-sample
Student’s t test, p � 0.017; Figure 4A–C]. The difference between
responses of AE� and AE� cells to osmotic stimuli is also appar-
ent in their mean response curves (Fig. 4D). A likely explanation
for the larger osmotic responses and the lack of an anion effect in
AE� cells is that salt responses in these cells are mediated primar-
ily by a sodium-conducting, osmotically sensitive ion channel.
Consistent with this, there is a significant positive correlation
between the size of Na-gluconate responses and the size of os-
motic responses (r 2 � 0.2851, p � 0.01; Fig. 4E), although there
are numerous outliers. This variability, at least in part, may be
methodological because testing both salt and osmotic responses
required exposing isolated taste cells to multiple stimuli that may
present challenges to cell health and could have had nonspecific
effects on the responsiveness of a cell to repeated stimuli.
While an osmotically sensitive ion channel appears to be a
primary contributor to salt responses in AE� cells, it also likely
contributes, to a lesser degree, to the overall response to salts in
AE� cells, given that responses to 140 mM NaCl plus cellobiose in
AE� cells were significantly larger than responses to 140 mM
NaCl alone. However, an osmotically sensitive ion channel would
not be sufficient to fully explain salt responses in AE� cells, given
their anion sensitivity and their significantly smaller responses to
osmotic stimuli than to NaCl. Interestingly, in AE� cells, the
average response magnitude to Na-gluconate and to cellobiose in
the 140 mM NaCl background was not significantly different
(two-sample Student’s t test, p � 0.91, n values indicated in Fig.
4C), which could indicate that large anions cause a near complete
inhibition of the non-osmotic component of salt responses in
AE� cells. Whether the osmotic responses in AE� and AE� cells
occur through the same or different mechanisms will require
additional investigation.
Discussion
In mammals, salty taste is specialized for the detection of NaCl
and other salts critical for cellular signaling and homeostasis.
Uncovering the mechanisms underlying the detection and palat-
ability of salts, particularly NaCl, may prove important for tack-
ling health problems associated with excessive salt consumption
in humans (Yang et al., 2011; Whelton et al., 2012). This study
investigated the encoding and transduction of salty taste re-
sponses in the AI salt taste pathway.
A major goal of these experiments was to test the hypothesis
that the anion effect is caused by inhibitory TPs generated across
the taste bud by the differential permeability of tight junctions at
the taste pore to cations and anions. We show that, even in the
absence of tight junctions and TPs, a majority of AI type III taste
cells still exhibit the anion effect, indicating that some compo-
nent of the AI salt transduction machinery is directly affected by
the identity of the anion of a salt.
We also characterized responses in type III taste cells to sour
tastants and osmotic stimuli. In the isolated taste cells tested, AI
salt responses were restricted to a subpopulation of sour-
responsive type III cells. We also found evidence that AI type III
taste cells are not a homogeneous population. Among the AI type
III cells, a significant minority had strong osmotic responses and
did not exhibit the anion effect. These results, in combination
with reports of AI salt-like responses in a subpopulation of bitter-
responsive type II cells (Oka et al., 2013), suggest that AI salt taste
is not transduced by a dedicated population of taste cells.
Characterization of AI salt responses in isolated taste cells
In the intact taste bud, taste cells are polarized with the ma-
jority of their membranes protected from direct exposure to
ingested tastants by tight junctions. The basolateral mem-
branes of taste cells are in contact with glial-like support cells
and engage in prolific cell-to-cell communication with other
taste cells (Roper, 2013). In this study, taste cells were removed
from the microenvironment of the taste bud, which necessi-
tates a careful interpretation of the results and their relevance
for taste bud function in vivo. One concern is the loss of taste
cell polarity, which could potentially enable tastants to inter-
act with receptors that may be inaccessible to them in an intact
taste bud. However, there is evidence that NaCl (Ye et al.,
1993, 1994; Anderson and Van Itallie, 2009) and sour taste
stimuli (particularly weak acids; Richter et al., 2003) are capa-
ble of directly or indirectly bypassing most tight junctions.
Thus, there is evidence that the NaCl and citric acid taste
stimuli used in this study could interact with receptors on the
basolateral membrane of taste cells even in the intact taste bud.
Another concern is that isolated taste cells could exhibit com-
1950 • J. Neurosci., February 10, 2016 • 36(6):1942–1953
Lewandowski et al. • Two Populations of Salt-Responsive Type III Cells
 pletely abnormal responses. The agreement of physiological
responses from our isolated cells with recordings from intact
taste buds (Tomchik et al., 2007; Oka et al., 2013), combined
with the identification of type III cell markers using single-cell
RT-PCR, strongly suggests that our data reflect physiologically
relevant responses from AI salt-responsive type III taste cells.
The anion effect in isolated taste cells
In the AI salt taste pathway, the magnitude of recorded responses
to sodium and non-sodium salts is inversely proportional to the
size of the anion of the salt. Theories proposing that TPs are
responsible for this “anion effect” are supported by evidence that
salts with larger anions typically generate larger TPs, and direct
manipulation of lingual TPs can significantly affect salt-related
responses in gustatory nerves (Ye et al., 1991, 1993, 1994). If the
anion effect were attributable entirely to inhibitory TPs or
some other effect related to the structure of the intact taste bud,
then isolated taste cells should respond equally to equimolar con-
centrations of sodium salts regardless of their associated anion.
However, we found that the majority of isolated AI salt-
responsive type III taste cells still exhibit reduced responses to
Na-gluconate (a large anion sodium salt) compared with NaCl.
These findings demonstrate that inhibitory TPs are not necessary
for taste cells to exhibit the anion effect; however, they do not
preclude the possibility that TPs contribute to the overall magni-
tude of the anion effect observed in vivo.
In this study, we identified two populations of AI type III taste
cells that could be distinguished by whether they did (AE� cells)
or did not (AE� cells) exhibit the anion effect. The AE� cell
population exhibited both the anion effect and AI NaCl re-
sponses, which fits the expected profile of AI type III taste cells
based on gustatory nerve recordings (Frank et al., 2008). There
are no specific reports of AI salt-responsive taste cells that do not
exhibit the anion effect (AE� cells); however, previous studies
that looked at salt responses in individual taste cells did not test
for the anion effect (Doolin and Gilbertson, 1996; Caicedo et al.,
2002; Tomchik et al., 2007; Yoshida et al., 2009a; Chandrashekar
et al., 2010; Oka et al., 2013).
The mechanism of AI salt transduction has remained elusive.
Our results indicate that some aspect of the transduction mech-
anism for AI salt taste in type III taste cells is either inhibited by
larger anions or else requires smaller anions to function effi-
ciently. The former mechanism may involve the L-type calcium
channels expressed by type III cells (Medler et al., 2003; DeFazio
et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2009). Some studies have reported that
larger (non-Cl �) anions can significantly reduce the open prob-
ability of L-type calcium channels by interacting with the intra-
cellular domain of � subunits (Thoreson and Stella, 2000; Babai
et al., 2010). However, we did not observe reduced responses to
K-gluconate relative to KCl, which would be expected if glu-
conate was inhibiting calcium channels.
Another possible explanation for the anion effect is that a
channel/protein involved in AI salt taste requires smaller
anions to function efficiently. Anion exchangers or anion-
conducting ion channels are membrane proteins that could
potentially operate with a level of efficiency approximately
correlated with anion size. The Cl �/HCO3
� anion exchanger is
notable because its activity is closely tied to the function of
carbonic anhydrase (Sterling et al., 2002; Svichar et al., 2009),
and inhibition of carbonic anhydrase is one of the only ma-
nipulations known to block AI salt responses in type III cells
(Oka et al., 2013). However, it is unclear how manipulation of
carbonic anhydrase activity could trigger a rapid signal trans-
duction cascade. Pharmacological inhibition of anion ex-
changers had no effect on salt responses (Elliott and Simon,
1990), and inhibition of Cl � channels either had no effect
(Elliott and Simon, 1990) or enhanced some salt responses
(Miyamoto et al., 2000), although the use of intact and par-
tially intact taste buds in these studies may have prevented
inhibition of proteins located on the basolateral surface of
taste cells. However, at this time, there is no direct evidence
for the involvement of anion exchangers/channels in AI salt
transduction.
The encoding of AI salt taste
Our discovery of a population of type III taste cells that appear to
express a Na �-conducting osmotically sensitive ion channel adds
another layer of complexity to AI salt taste transduction. Our data
suggest that type III taste cells could respond to AI salt stimuli
through two separate transduction pathways: (1) an osmotically
sensitive pathway; and (2) an anion-inhibitable pathway. Al-
though one pathway appears to predominate in a given AI type III
cell, it is not yet clear whether these mechanisms are completely
segregated or whether there is some level of coexpression. Fur-
thermore, although taste cells in an intact taste bud can be
strongly affected by apically applied osmotic stimuli (Lyall et al.,
1999), it is not certain that AE� cells housed in an intact taste bud
will exhibit the same osmotically mediated salt response profile
we observed in isolated AE� cells. If AE� and AE� AI type III
taste cells can be distinguished in the intact taste bud, then addi-
tional research will be needed to determine whether AE� and
AE� cells are redundant mechanisms for AI salt detection or
whether they are complimentary mechanisms for sensing slightly
different aspects of the same taste quality.
Previous studies have shown that type III taste cells are critical
for both sour and AI salt taste (Huang et al., 2006; Tomchik et al.,
2007; Yoshida et al., 2009b; Oka et al., 2013); however, it was
unclear whether receptors for these taste qualities were expressed
by the same or separate populations of taste cells. By recording
from taste cells in the absence of cell-to-cell communication, we
were able to show that AI salt responses are found in a subset of
sour-responsive taste cells. Combined with previous data show-
ing AI salt taste-like responses in a subset of bitter-sensitive type
II cells (Oka et al., 2013), these data would indicate that there is no
dedicated population of taste cells underlying AI salt taste. This
implies that perception of AI salt taste relies on the combined
activation of taste cell populations that also encode other distinct
taste qualities (bitter or sour), which is difficult to reconcile with
labeled-line theories of taste encoding.
