Vagotomy and Parkinson disease
A Swedish register–based matched-cohort study
ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine whether vagotomy decreases the risk of Parkinson disease (PD).
Methods: Using data from nationwide Swedish registers, we conducted a matched-cohort study
of 9,430 vagotomized patients (3,445 truncal and 5,978 selective) identified between 1970
and 2010 and 377,200 reference individuals from the general population individually matched
to vagotomized patients by sex and year of birth with a 40:1 ratio. Participants were followed
up from the date of vagotomy until PD diagnosis, death, emigration out of Sweden, or December
31, 2010, whichever occurred first. Vagotomy and PD were identified from the Swedish Patient
Register. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox models
stratified by matching variables, adjusting for country of birth, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, diabetes mellitus, vascular diseases, rheumatologic disease, osteoarthritis, and comorbidity
index.
Results: A total of 4,930 cases of incident PD were identified during 7.3 million person-years of
follow-up. PD incidence (per 100,000 person-years) was 61.8 among vagotomized patients
(80.4 for truncal and 55.1 for selective) and 67.5 among reference individuals. Overall, vagotomy
was not associated with PD risk (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.78–1.17). However, there was a suggestion
of lower risk among patients with truncal vagotomy (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55–1.09), which may be
driven by truncal vagotomy at least 5 years before PD diagnosis (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37–0.93).
Selective vagotomy was not related to PD risk in any analyses.
Conclusions: Although overall vagotomy was not associated the risk of PD, we found suggestive
evidence for a potential protective effect of truncal, but not selective, vagotomy against PD
development. Neurology® 2017;88:1996–2002

Gastrointestinal symptoms, in particular constipation, are among the most common nonmotor
symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD).1,2 Furthermore, Braak and others3–5 hypothesized that in
PD the Lewy pathology may start in peripheral nerves such as the enteric nervous system and
later spread to the CNS through the vagus nerve via prion-like mechanisms.3–5 In support of
this, recent pathologic studies found Lewy-type deposition in the gut of individuals with pro-
dromal PD.6,7 Furthermore, cell-to-cell a-synuclein transmission has been observed in both
grafted neurons in patients with PD8,9 and transplanted neurons in a transgenic mouse model of
PD.10 In murine models, injection of human a-synuclein into the intestinal wall led to a later
a-synuclein observation in the vagus nerve.11 Intragastric injection of rotenone initiated
a-synuclein accumulation in the enteric nerve system that subsequently spread to the vagal

 dorsal motor nuclei and substantia nigra pars
compacta.12 Resection of the vagus nerve
before rotenone treatment stopped the spread
of PD-like pathology.13 Taken together, these
data support the intriguing Braak and prion
hypotheses of PD development.
These observations also led to the hypothe-
sis that vagotomy surgery in human reduces
the risk of PD. Empiric evidence to date, how-
ever, is scarce and inconsistent.14,15 We there-
fore evaluated the association of vagotomy
with PD risk using data from Swedish nation-
wide registers.
METHODS Databases. Analytic data were derived from sev-
eral nationwide Swedish registers that were linked via the unique
personal identification number of Swedish residents. In brief, the
Swedish Patient Register was first established in 1964 to 1965 to
collect information about dates of admission to and discharge
from hospitals, surgical procedures, and medical diagnoses at dis-
charge. Coverage increased gradually to 76% in 1977 and became
100% in 1987.16,17 In 1997, the Patient Register started to cover
surgical day care procedures, and in 2001, it was expanded to
outpatient visits, covering z80% of all hospital visits and almost
100% of public clinics.18 Primary health care visits are not yet
included in the Patient Register.18 Swedish Population and Hous-
ing Censuses were conducted every 5 years from 1960 to 1990 by
Statistics Sweden19 and were mandatory for Swedish residents
$16 years of age. The censuses contain detailed information
on housing, civil status, highest attained level of education,
income, occupation, and social class. The Cause of Death Regis-
ter, available since 1961, contains nationwide information about
dates of death, places of residence, underlying causes of death, and
contributing causes of death. Information about dates of immi-
gration into (from 1969) and emigration out of (from 1961)
Sweden is recorded in the Total Population Register.20
Ascertainment of vagotomy and patients with PD. Vago-
tomized patients were identified from the Patient Register with
the use of codes from the Swedish Classification of Operations
and Major Procedures: 4471 to 4478, 4411 to 4416, 4418 to
4419, 4451, and 4453 during the period of 1964 to 1996, and
JDG00, JDG01, JDG10, JDG11, JDG96, and JDG97 from
1997 onward. Vagotomy was further classified as truncal or selec-
tive (including both selective and highly selective) subtypes after
review of the surgical codes by the gastroenterologic surgeon in
our team (A.E.) (table e-1 at Neurology.org). The date of hos-
pital discharge was used as the date of surgery. Cases with PD
were individuals with PD diagnosis from any of the inpatient or
outpatient hospital visits with the Swedish revisions of ICD codes
(ICD-7: 350, 1964–1968; ICD-8: 342, 1969–1986; ICD-9:
332.0, 1987–1996; and ICD-10: G20, 1997 onward). The
date of first hospital admission or outpatient contact was used as
the date of identification. In a previous study, the positive pre-
dictive value of any PD diagnosis (primary or secondary) from the
inpatient hospital care compared to standardized clinical evalua-
tion was 70.8%.21
Study design. We applied a matched-cohort study design. A
total of 10,006 vagotomized patients were identified from the
Patient Register between 1970 and 2010, among whom 9,430
vagotomized patients who met the criteria of being born before
1970 and living in Sweden without PD diagnosis before vagot-
omy were eligible for inclusion in the study. The date of vagot-
omy was defined as the index date. For each patient with
vagotomy, 40 reference individuals who were living in Sweden
without previous vagotomy and PD diagnosis were randomly
selected from the Swedish Population and Housing Census in
1970 and individually matched on sex and year of birth on the
index date. To account for incomplete coverage of the Patient
Register before 1987, potential reference individuals were
required to live in the counties covered by the Patient Register
according to their residence information in the 1970 census (n 5
6,018,543). A total of 9,430 vagotomized patients and 377,200
reference individuals were identified and followed up from the
index date to the date of PD identification, death, or emigration
out of Sweden or December 31, 2010, whichever occurred first.
Covariates. We categorized age on the index date in the catego-
ries of 13 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64,
65 to 69, and $70 years and the index year of vagotomy into 5-
year intervals. Country of birth was defined as Sweden, not
Sweden, or unknown. Comorbidities were identified by ICD
codes (see table e-2 for details) and included diabetes mellitus,
vascular diseases, and rheumatologic disease. We used osteoar-
thritis and rheumatologic disease as indicators for use of non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Lifetime chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was derived as a proxy for
smoking status. Furthermore, we also created a comorbidity index
for analytic purposes according to the Deyo et al22 modification of
Charlson
Comorbidity Index.23
We
excluded the above-
referenced specific diseases from the index because they were
adjusted for individually. The comorbidity index was weighted
according to the severity of the diseases and categorized into 3
groups: 0, 1 to 2, or $3 points.24 Peptic ulcer, which was the
main indication of vagotomy, was not considered as a covariate
because of concern about overadjustment.
Statistical analysis. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for PD from Cox proportional
hazard models using time since the index date as an underlying
time scale. Cumulative incidence of PD was calculated for vago-
tomized patients and their matched controls, accounting for
death as a competing risk. We first analyzed vagotomy overall
as the primary outcome of interest and further analyzed truncal
and selective vagotomy separately. To explore the temporal rela-
tionship between vagotomy and PD and to minimize concern
about reverse causation, we analyzed the association among indi-
viduals followed up at least 5, 10, or 20 years by including an
interaction between vagotomy and time-band variables splitting
at respective follow-up years.
The association between vagotomy and PD risk was first eval-
uated conditionally on matching variables only and then addi-
tionally adjusted for country of birth, COPD, diabetes mellitus,
vascular diseases, rheumatologic disease, osteoarthritis, and co-
morbidity index. Selection of potential confounders was based
on previous literature.14,25–27 Potential effect modification by
sex was examined by including an interaction term between sex
and type of vagotomy. Participants with missing data on country
of birth (0.02% of total) were excluded from the adjusted models.
The proportional hazard assumption for Cox models was tested
and fulfilled over the entire follow-up period.
To control for confounding by indication for surgery and fac-
tors related to the indication, we conducted a sensitivity analysis
by comparing PD risk in individuals with truncal and selective
vagotomy. While truncal vagotomy and selective vagotomy differ
by extent of surgical procedure, indications for the surgery

 (i.e., peptic ulcer with complications) and factors related to the
indication (i.e., smoking and NSAID use) are often similar. Thus,
if differential risks were observed, it would further suggest that
the risk difference was due to the procedure itself rather than
an indication for surgery or related factors. We used Stata 13

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics
Review Board in Stockholm. Because this study included analyses
of deidentified data, written consent from participants was not
required.
RESULTS The analyses included 9,430 vagotomized
patients (3,445 truncal, 5,978 selective, and 7 unknown)
and 377,200 reference individuals. Mean 6 SD age
at index date was 54.3 6 15.2 years. A total of 4,930
cases of PD were identified during 7.3 million
person-years of follow-up. Mean 6 SD age at PD
diagnosis in the entire cohort was 75.6 6 8.4 years.
The crude incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years)
for PD was 61.8 among vagotomized patients (80.4
for truncal and 55.1 for selective) and 67.5 among
reference individuals. The cumulative incidence of
PD in truncal and selective vagotomized patients
compared to the matched reference individuals is
shown in figures 1 and 2.
Characteristics of the study participants are shown
in table 1. The distributions of sex and year of birth
were the same in vagotomized patients and reference
individuals as a result of matching. Proportionally,
more
vagotomized
patients
were
born
outside
Sweden. Individuals with truncal vagotomy were older
than those with selective vagotomy or reference indi-
viduals. During 1970 to 1979, more truncal vagoto-
mies were performed than selective vagotomies,
whereas in 1980 and after, selective vagotomies were
more common. As expected, .85% of vagotomized
patients had a history of peptic ulcer, which is the main
indication for vagotomy. More COPD was observed in
both the truncal and selective vagotomy groups com-
pared to the reference group. Furthermore, vagotom-
ized patients, especially those with truncal vagotomy,
were more likely to have diabetes mellitus, vascular
diseases, rheumatologic disease, osteoarthritis, and
a higher comorbidity index than reference individuals.
Overall, we did not observe an association of
vagotomy with PD (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.78–1.17)
(table 2). However, patients with truncal vagotomy
appeared to have a lower risk than reference individ-
uals, although the difference was not statistically sig-
nificant. In the analysis that split the follow-up at year
5, we found a lower risk of PD .5 years after truncal
vagotomy (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37–0.93), and similar
results were observed for .10 years after truncal
vagotomy (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36–1.08). In the
analysis that restricted to follow-up .20 years,
although there appeared to be a lower PD risk after
truncal vagotomy, the risk reduction was not statisti-
cally significant. Selective vagotomy was not associ-
ated with PD risk in any of the analyses. In the
analyses that compared truncal and selective vagot-
omy . 5 years after the surgery, we observed a lower
PD risk among patients with truncal vagotomy
(HR 5 0.54, 95% CI 5 0.32–0.91) (table e-3).
DISCUSSION In this large population-based study,
although we did not observe an association between
overall vagotomy and PD risk, patients with truncal

 vagotomy appeared to have a lower risk of PD. Further
sensitivity analysis comparing truncal and selective
vagotomy (i.e., selective and highly selective subtypes)
argues against confounding by indication of surgery or
factors related to indication such as smoking and
NSAID use. In contrast, we found no evidence for
lower PD risk among patients with selective vagotomy.
Although controversial, one implication of the
Braak hypothesis is that, in some cases of PD, the Lewy
pathology may initiate from the Meissner and Auer-
bach plexuses of the gut and then spread retrogradely
along the vagus nerve to the dorsal motor nucleus in
the lower brainstem via prion-like mechanisms.4,28 If
this is true, resection of the vagus nerve may stop or
delay the spreading of Lewy pathology and thus pre-
vent or delay the clinical onset of PD. Indeed, in
murine models of PD, vagotomy slowed the spreading
of synucleinopathy to the brainstem that was initiated
by gastrointestinal administration of rotenone, a pesti-
cide known to induce parkinsonism.13
In clinical practice, there are 3 types of vagotomy.
The truncal vagotomy denervates multiple organs,
including the stomach, liver, gall bladder, pancreas,
small intestine, and proximal colon; selective vagot-
omy eliminates innervation to the stomach; and
highly selective vagotomy eliminates only innervation
to the stomach body while preserving innervation to
the antrum and pylorus.29 Therefore, in the case of

 selective or highly selective vagotomy, synucleinop-
athy initiated at other gastrointestinal sites may still
find its way to the vagus nerve and then to the brain-
stem. Because Lewy pathology was found at multiple
gastrointestinal sites in patients with PD,30 this rea-
soning may in part explain our observation that only
truncal vagotomy, but not selective or highly selective
vagotomy, was associated with a lower risk of PD.
Before our study, only 2 publications reported
vagotomy in relation to PD in humans, and the evi-
dence to date is very preliminary.14,15 Using Danish
national registers from 1977 to 1995, Svensson
et al.14 reported a 15% lower PD risk .5 years after
truncal vagotomy compared to the general population;
the effect appeared to be stronger when restricted to
.20 years after the surgery (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.53–
0.99). This Danish study, however, did not differenti-
ate truncal from selective vagotomy and thus might
have underestimated the association of truncal vagot-
omy with PD.14 Tysnes et al.,15 who analyzed the same
Danish population with extended follow-up (1977–
2011), reported a nonsignificantly lower PD risk for
truncal vagotomy overall (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55–
1.21) and a nonsignificantly elevated PD risk .20
years after the surgery (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.23–
2.05). Therefore, although data on temporal relation-
ship are inconsistent, available evidence, including that
from our study, offers preliminary support that truncal
vagotomy may decrease the risk of PD.
Reasons for different observations on the temporal
relationship are speculative. Among others, all studies
had relatively few exposed cases of PD; furthermore,
potential confounding from unmeasured factors
(e.g., use of NSAIDs or smoking) during the long
follow-up is likely. In our study, we observed stronger
evidence for PD risk reduction .5 or 10 years after
truncal vagotomy, but the association was attenuated
with .20 years of follow-up. This observation was
supported by our sensitivity analysis comparing trun-
cal and selective vagotomy that may, to certain extent,
have accounted for unmeasured confounding. Our
observation of the temporal relationship is consistent
with the possibility that PD pathology may start at
multiple sites of peripheral nervous system. Therefore,
even truncal vagotomy may delay rather than elimi-
nate the risk for PD. Indeed, abnormal a-synuclein
accumulation has been found throughout the diges-
tive tract of patients with PD with descending pattern
of density and even in the submandibular gland in
patients with preclinical PD.1,6,7 Furthermore, the
Braak hypothesis also posits that the PD pathology
may start in the olfactory bulb.31,32 In support of this,
poor sense of smell is the most prevalent nonmotor
symptom in prodromal PD2 and is strongly associated
with future PD risk in the general population.
Nevertheless, all 3 studies had limited statistical
power to examine the potential long-term effect
of truncal vagotomy with PD.
Both the strengths and limitations of our study
stem from the use of nationwide registries. Because
of the rarity of both vagotomy and PD, one has to
resort to extremely large databases such as this one to
examine the proposed hypothesis. Other strengths of
the current study include the long follow-up of z40
years and carefully planned data analyses. We distin-
guished truncal from selective or highly selective vagot-
omy and separately assessed their associations with PD.
Furthermore, the comparison of truncal and selective
vagotomy, to some extent, alleviated concerns of con-
founding by indication or by other confounders such
as smoking. Limitations of the current study include
the limited statistical power despite the use of nation-
wide data. This is particularly true in the analyses of
temporal relationships. Second, the use of nationwide
registries likely induced misclassification, particularly
for PD diagnosis and time of diagnosis. However, these
misclassifications were likely nondifferential with
respect to exposure assessment and might therefore
have underestimated the true association. Further-
more, the analyses for cases diagnosed at least 5, 10,
or 20 years after vagotomy largely alleviated concerns
about reverse causality. In addition, although we at-
tempted to control for major confounders using
surrogate variables, we were unable to fully control
for potential confounding due to individual-based risk
factors for PD such as smoking, coffee intake, or genet-
ics using register-based data. Finally, if the observed
association is confirmed and proven to be biological,
we expect the results could be generalized to popula-
tions in other parts of the world.
Although we did not observe a relationship of over-
all vagotomy and PD risk, we found preliminary evi-
dence that truncal, but not selective, vagotomy was
related to a lower risk of PD. These observations are
largely consistent with those from the previous Danish
study. Taken together, these data provide preliminary
and indirect support for the Braak and prion-like
hypotheses for PD prodromal development.
