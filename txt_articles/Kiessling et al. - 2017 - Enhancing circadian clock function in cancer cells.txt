Abstract
Background: Circadian clocks control cell cycle factors, and circadian disruption promotes cancer. To address whether
enhancing circadian rhythmicity in tumor cells affects cell cycle progression and reduces proliferation, we compared
growth and cell cycle events of B16 melanoma cells and tumors with either a functional or dysfunctional clock.
Results: We found that clock genes were suppressed in B16 cells and tumors, but treatments inducing circadian
rhythmicity, such as dexamethasone, forskolin and heat shock, triggered rhythmic clock and cell cycle gene expression,
which resulted in fewer cells in S phase and more in G1 phase. Accordingly, B16 proliferation in vitro and tumor
growth in vivo was slowed down. Similar effects were observed in human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells. Notably, the
effects of dexamethasone were not due to an increase in apoptosis nor to an enhancement of immune cell
recruitment to the tumor. Knocking down the essential clock gene Bmal1 in B16 tumors prevented the effects of
dexamethasone on tumor growth and cell cycle events.
Conclusions: Here we demonstrated that the effects of dexamethasone on cell cycle and tumor growth are mediated
by the tumor-intrinsic circadian clock. Thus, our work reveals that enhancing circadian clock function might represent a
novel strategy to control cancer progression.

Background
Tumor cells are characterized by uncontrolled cell pro-
liferation resulting in abnormal and accelerated tissue
growth. In contrast, “healthy” cells often proliferate with
a division rate of ~24 h [1]. This is due to the direct
control of cell cycle checkpoints by the intracellular
circadian clock machinery [2].
Circadian clocks operate in most tissues at the single-
cell level [3]. At the molecular level, these clocks are based
on clock genes, which participate in auto-regulatory feed-
back loops. In the core loop, the transcription factors
CLOCK and BMAL1 activate the expression of Per and
Cry genes, whose protein products negatively feed back
on their own expression [4]. Several additional feedback
loops contribute to this canonical mechanism, including
one involving the nuclear receptor NR1D1. Moreover, in
any given cell type, 5–20% of the transcriptome is under
circadian control [5]. This is the basis for circadian control
of
major
physiological
processes,
including
immune
functions and, most importantly for this investigation, cell
proliferation [2, 6].
Misalignment between the external and internal time
and circadian disruption, such as during shift work, has
been associated with an increased cancer risk [7–10]
and promotes tumor growth [11–13]. Moreover, circa-
dian clock alteration due to mutations of single clock
genes, such as Per2 or Bmal1, accelerates tumor growth
[14, 15] or the whole carcinogenesis process [16–18].
This is putatively due to an increase in proliferation rate
upon circadian rhythm disruption, because tumor sup-
pressor and key cell cycle genes are under clock control
[2, 3] in the context of a bidirectional clock–cell cycle
coupling [19, 20]. In support of the connection between
rhythm disruption and oncogenesis, deregulated circadian
rhythms appear to be a common feature of cancer cell
lines [14, 21] and advanced-stage tumors [3]. Moreover, in
mouse models of tumorigenesis, the outcome of the dis-
ease correlates with the level of improvement of circadian

 rhythmicity [22, 23]. Intriguingly, cancer prognosis and
survival has been associated with the level of circadian
disruption in patient tumor tissues [24, 25]. Although a
previous study suggested a role for the circadian clock
within cancer cells in tumor growth [22], direct evidence
has been missing. Here, we show that improving circadian
rhythms in the tumor slows down cell cycle progression
and strongly reduces proliferation and tumor growth.
Methods
Study design
The general objective of the study was to investigate the
role of the tumor cell-intrinsic circadian clock in relation
to cell proliferation in culture and tumor growth in
mice. For this purpose, we activated the circadian clock
in B16 melanoma cells and subcutaneous (s.c.) B16 tu-
mors and compared cell cycle gene expression, cell cycle
phase distribution and tumor growth after repeated
dexamethasone
(DEX)
or
phosphate-buffered
saline
(PBS) treatment under controlled laboratory experimen-
tal conditions. We repeated those experiments using
Control or Bmal1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-trans-
fected B16 tumors as a model with an inducible or non-
inducible circadian clock. In the in vitro experiments, other
clock-enhancing treatments (forskolin, heat shock) were
also used. Further, we used NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull
(NSG) mice to exclude the possible role of DEX on im-
mune infiltration in the tumors. HCT-116 cells and tumors
were used to extend the data obtained from B16 melanoma
cells to another cancer cell line, from human origin. In all
animal experiments, mice were killed after 7–13 days of
treatment and during the second day in constant darkness
at the indicated circadian hours. The sample size could
change during an experiment when the tumor size reached
the previously defined clinical endpoint of individual
mice and animals had to be killed. The sample size of
all biological replicates per time point is indicated in
each figure legend or the related tables (in Additional
file 1), and mice were randomized between all groups.
The study was not performed double-blinded: the ex-
perimenter was not blind to the identity of the animal
in the different groups, because the treatment of each
animal had to be performed according to the specific
group. None of the animals was excluded from the
analysis or the statistics.
Cell culture and bioluminescence recordings
The B16 and HCT-116 cell lines, developed from murine
skin and human colonic carcinoma [26, 27], were obtained
from Drs Hua Gu (Institut de Recherche Clinique de
Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada) and Dindial Ramotar
(University of Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada), respect-
ively, and cultured using standard conditions. Stable trans-
fections with luciferase reporters were done according to
standard procedures. More details can be found in the
Additional file 2. All cell lines tested negative for Myco-
plasma. B16 cells express the glucocorticoid receptor [28]
and HSF1 [29], the latter being relevant for circadian
synchronization by heat shock [30]. HCT-116 cells seem
not to express functional glucocorticoid receptors [31].
However, steroids such as glucocorticoids can act through
glucocorticoid receptor-independent pathways [32] and
the synchronization of circadian rhythms in HCT-116
cells can be achieved by DEX treatment [33].
For whole-culture imaging, B16 cells or 200 μm slices
of tumors from B16 cells with luciferase reporters were
cultured in sealed dishes and recorded in a LumiCycle
luminometer (Actimetrics Inc., Wilmette, IL, USA).
Overall brightness was calculated by averaging values
from 12 h after the start of recording to the end of re-
cording. For single-cell imaging, B16 cells or B16 tumor
slices were cultured under a microscope inside an incu-
bator, and recorded using a charge-coupled device cam-
era (Ikon-M 934BV Series, Andor Technology, Belfast,
UK). Images were collected at intervals of 30 min, with
29 min exposure duration. Data were smoothed by a
running minimum algorithm, and bioluminescence in-
tensity was measured within a region of interest with a
constant size, but defined manually for each moving cell.
Detailed conditions and data analysis can be found in
Additional file 2.
ShRNA knockdown
Bmal1 shRNA or Scrambled shRNA Lentiviral Particles
(Creative Biogene, Shirley, NY, USA) consist of a pool of
three constructs encoding 19–25 nt long target-specific
shRNA, or shRNA with the same sequence composition,
but scrambled. We ensured that the sequences of Bmal1
shRNAs were absent in the mouse genome. B16 cells
were grown in 12-well plates until 50% confluency. The
medium was replaced with antibiotic-free Opti-MEM
medium with 5 μg/mL Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). Cells were infected by the addition of
1 × 105 infectious units of virus. After 24 h, the medium
was replaced with regular growth medium. Stable clones
expressing the shRNA were selected using puromycin (4
μg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich). All cell lines tested negative for
Mycoplasma.
Proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle assays in vitro
To study proliferation, cell death and cell cycle, B16 and
HCT-116
cells
were
cultured
until
reaching
70%
confluency and then stimulated with DEX (200 nM) or
forskolin (FSK) (100 nM). Medium was replaced after
2 h. In different experiments, the cells were exposed
to a heat shock of 43 °C for 30 min [30]. Live and dead
cells were counted using Trypan blue, and apoptotic cells
were assessed by Annexin V staining. Cell cycle phases

 were studied by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and 7-
aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) stainings, cell cycle phase
distribution and cell cycle arrest were measured by Ki67
and Annexin V stainings, and mitotic index was assessed
by phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) staining, using standard
protocols. More details can be found in Additional file 2.
Animals, DEX injections and tumor growth monitoring
C57BL/6J mice and NSG mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar
Harbor, ME, USA) were housed (≤5/cage) under 12 h
light (100 lux):12 h dark (0 lux) conditions with food
and water available ad libitum. Male mice (2–3 months
old) were used in all experiments, except for one experi-
ment with shRNA-expressing tumors to evaluate the
tumor growth, in which 4-month-old females were used.
The sample size of all biological replicates per time point
is indicated in each figure legend or related supplemen-
tary table and mice were randomized between all
groups.
C57BL/6J mice or NSG mice were inoculated with
1.5 × 106 B16 cells in the tail vein or subcutaneously or
3 × 106 HCT-116 cells. The s.c. tumor volume was mea-
sured in two dimensions with a caliper and calculated
based on the volume of an ellipsoid. When s.c. tumors
reached a volume of ~100 μL (after 10–15 days), DEX
(or PBS) was injected intra-tumorally every second day
at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 6 (6 hours after lights on) to
reach a concentration of 200 nM within the tumor (cal-
culated based on the tumor volume). Tumor growth was
measured daily. Tumor growth was compared showing
absolute tumor volume when the tumors were on aver-
age 100 μL and did not differ between mice by more
than approximately ±15 μL at the first treatment day. In
case of experimental starting conditions when the tumor
volume of mice differed more than 50 μL between indi-
vidual mice at the first treatment day, the relative tumor
growth was calculated relative to the initial starting vol-
ume for each individual mouse. Mice were killed by
cervical dislocation at the indicated circadian times
(CTs) during the second day of darkness, 18–25 days
after inoculation. Eyes were removed under a 15 W
red safety light prior to dissection. Tumors and host
organs were harvested and kept at −80 °C until fur-
ther analysis.
Cell cycle, immune cell labeling and protein expression
assays on tumors
Cell cycle phases were determined using BrdU and
7AAD staining. BrdU (1.2 mg/ml) was injected intra-
tumorally 6 h before tumors were collected. Cell lysates
from fixed s.c. tumors were incubated with mouse
anti-BrdU antibody and then with Alexa Fluor 488
goat anti-mouse IgG. Finally, cells were incubated
with 7AAD viability staining solution. Mitotic index
was evaluated on tumor cell lysate incubated with
anti-pHH3 antibody and then with Alexa Fluor 488
donkey anti-rabbit antibody. A second set of cell ly-
sates were stained for Annexin V. Cell cycle arrest
and proliferation was detected in cells from fixed s.c.
tumors in NSG mice or in Scrambled shRNA and
Bmal1
shRNA
cultured
cells
using
the
Ki67
Set
according to manufacturer’s protocol.
For tumor immune cell infiltration in vivo, tumors were
collected throughout the circadian day (second day in
darkness) on the seventh day after the first DEX treat-
ment. One million cells from s.c. tumor suspensions with
and without collagenase treatment were blocked with Fc
Block and then incubated with first antibodies for T cells
(CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19), dendritic cells (CD11c), mac-
rophages (F4/80, CD11b), neutrophils (CD11b, F4/80,
Ly6G) or monocytes (CD11b, F4/80, Ly6C), followed by
labeled streptavidin in the case of CD11b staining.
For protein expression in vivo, tumors were collected
(as described above) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with 90% methanol, and incubated with
antibodies for WEE1, c-MYC, CYCLIN E (CCNE),
CDK2,
p57
(CDKN1c),
CDK1,
p21
(CDKN1a)
or
BMAL1 (ARNTL). After blocking with 10% rat or goat
serum, appropriate secondary antibodies were used.
Controls for each sample were stained with the second-
ary antibody alone. Finally, the cell suspensions were
analyzed by flow cytometry.
All samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a
FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and
FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, Oregon, USA).
Controls for each sample were stained with the second-
ary antibody alone. More details can be found in Add-
itional file 2, including panel descriptions, antibodies
and fluorophores.
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
immunohistochemistry
Standard protocols were used to perform quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochem-
istry. Details about protocols, primer sequences, anti-
bodies and data analysis can be found in Additional file 2.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done with GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Mann-
Whitney rank sum test (alpha = 0.05, two-tailed) was used
for knockdown efficiency. Circadian variation was tested
by fitting a cosine-wave equation,

on cell cycle gene expression data, with a fixed 24-h
period; significance was determined using an F-test. For
datasets with more than two time points, a Kruskal-
Wallis test was used (alpha = 0.05, two-tailed), taking the
small sample size into consideration even if the normal-
ity test passed. For differences over time between two
groups or more, two-way ANOVA was used, followed by
Bonferroni’s posthoc test. A statistically significant differ-
ence was assumed when p < 0.05. Statistical details are
presented in Additional file 1.
Results
Induction of circadian clock function in B16 melanoma
cells
First we characterized circadian rhythm generation in
B16 melanoma cells. Reporter constructs consisting of
the luciferase gene under the control of the Bmal1 or
the Per2 promoter (Bmal1-Luc, Per2-Luc) were stably
transfected in B16 cells. The bioluminescence of these
cells was arrhythmic (Fig. 1a, from −44 to 0 h). However,
upon addition of DEX, an agonist of the glucocorticoid
receptor (which is expressed in B16 cells [28]) known to
induce circadian rhythms in cultured cells, we observed
rhythmic Bmal1-Luc and Per2-Luc promoter activity
with the expected opposite phases (Fig. 1a) [34], which,
however dampened earlier than in various non-cancer
cell lines [35, 36].
To address whether the loss of rhythmicity after a few
cycles resulted from circadian dysfunction in individual
cells or from a desynchronization among rhythmic cells,
we analyzed Per2-Luc bioluminescence at the single-cell
level (Fig. 1b, Additional file 3, Additional file 4A–E).
Although rhythms in the circadian range (first to second
peak: 24.2 ± 1.4 h, second to third peak: 25.3 ± 2.0 h,
third to fourth peak: 24.3 ± 1.5 h; Additional file 4E, F)
were induced by DEX in ~90% of the cells, they quickly
dampened within two to three cycles: 50% and 36% of
the cells showed a second or third circadian peak,
respectively, but circadian rhythms in bioluminescence
were greatly suppressed in all cells after 132 h (Fig. 1b,
Additional file 4A–D, G). Similarly the amplitude of
single-cell rhythms dropped by about 80% within three
cycles and the phase distribution became dispersed after
48 h (Additional file 4H, I). Repeated treatments showed
that clock gene suppression was not due to cell death
(Additional file 4J). Overall, these data indicated a sup-
pression of clock gene expression in B16 cells rather
than a desynchronization between single cells.
Rhythmic clock gene expression was also observed
when employing alternative methods for clock gene acti-
vation [30, 37]: FSK, an activator of adenylyl cyclase and
of the cAMP/PKA pathway (Fig. 1c), heat shock (Fig. 1d)
and serum shock (Fig. 1e) all induced transcript oscilla-
tions in B16 cells. In addition to Bmal1 and Per2, the
mRNAs of clock genes Per1, Cry1 and Nr1d1 also
fluctuated rhythmically in B16 cells after DEX treatment
but not in untreated cells (Fig. 1f–j).
Altogether, these results indicated that the B16 cells
harbor an unstable but inducible circadian oscillator.
We decided to take advantage of this property to address
the role of the tumor cell-intrinsic clock in cell prolifera-
tion and tumor growth.
The cell cycle is under circadian control after
dexamethasone treatment in vitro
Because the molecular clockwork was shown to regulate
the expression of genes encoding cell cycle regulators
[2], we set out to study the expression of such genes in
B16 cells. B16 cells were treated with DEX for 2 h,
harvested over 24 h, and tested for mRNA expression of
WEE 1 homolog 1 (Wee1), Cyclin-dependent kinase 1
(Cdk1), Cdk2, Cyclin E, Myelocytomatosis oncogene c
(c-Myc)
and
Cyclin-dependent
kinase
inhibitor
1A
(p21). All six genes showed predominant 24-h rhythm
components in transcript abundance as a consequence
of DEX treatment (Fig. 1k–p).
Because these factors are involved in cell cycle check-
points, we assessed the effect of DEX treatment on the
distribution of B16 cells among cell cycle stages. Cells
were collected at different time points over 24 h, stained
for BrdU incorporation and with 7AAD, and analyzed by
flow cytometry (Fig. 2a, b). The proportion of cells in
G0/1, G2/M and S phases was found to be rhythmic in
cells treated with DEX, while control cells showed no
circadian variation (Fig. 2c–e). Interestingly, fewer cells
entered the S phase 24, 36 and 42 h after DEX treatment
(Fig. 2e), indicating less DNA replication, while more
cells were found in G0/G1 phases (Fig. 2c).
Induction of the circadian clock slows down B16 cell
proliferation in vitro
Given that activation of the circadian clock in B16 cells
triggered rhythms of cell cycle genes and phases, we
next tested whether activation of the clock in B16 cells
influences their proliferation. Thirty-six hours after DEX
treatment, we counted significantly fewer live cells than
without treatment (Fig. 2f), while the amount of dead
cells in the medium was unchanged after 12–48 h
(Additional file 4N). The effect was even more pro-
nounced after 2 days, with ~50% fewer live cells but
similar numbers of dead cells after DEX treatment
(Fig. 2g, Additional file 4O). Of note, the numbers of live
Kiessling et al. BMC Biology  (2017) 15:13 
Page 4 of 18
 and dead cells were similar before and immediately after
the end of the 2 h DEX treatment, suggesting that
the treatment did not acutely induce cellular toxicity
(Additional file 4K).
Because rhythms quickly dampened after treatment
(Fig. 1) we tested whether repeated DEX treatment
could further inhibit cell proliferation. While a single
DEX treatment significantly reduced cell numbers after
50 h, a second treatment further reduced the amount of
cells after 96 h (Fig. 2h). Population doubling time
(PDT) was increased to 22.7 h in single DEX-treated
cells and further to 23.0 h in double DEX-treated cells
compared to 16.5 h PDT in untreated control cells.
Annexin V staining indicated that the differences in cell
counts were not due to differences in levels of apoptosis
(Additional file 4P). Total cell numbers were even more
reduced after three DEX treatments administered every
48 h (Additional file 4L, M).
Similar experiments were also conducted with other
stimuli activating the B16 clock (Fig. 1). Both a single
FSK treatment (Fig. 2f, g) and repeated FSK treatments
(Additional file 4M) were as effective as DEX in slowing
down B16 cell proliferation. Also, FSK treatment did not
affect cell death rates (Additional file 4N, O), nor did it
acutely impact on cell numbers right after the 2 h treat-
ment (Additional file 4K). Moreover, exposing the cells

 to a 30 min heat shock was sufficient to reduce prolifer-
ation without affecting apoptosis (Fig. 2i, Additional
file 4Q). PDT was increased to 20.7 h after heat
shock compared to 17.2 h in untreated cells. These
data suggested that the reduction in cell proliferation
might be due to action on intrinsic clock function, as
activating clock gene expression was the common
denominator of all three treatments.
Dexamethasone activates the circadian clock in B16 tumors
B16 melanoma cells, which represent a well-established
and widely used mouse model for human melanoma
[38], form lung and s.c. tumors when injected in the
tail vein and subcutaneously, respectively (Additional
file 5A, B). The analysis of circadian clock gene
expression in B16 lung tumors unveiled suppressed or
arrhythmic Per1, Per2 and Bmal1 expression, while

 there was robust circadian oscillation in the neighbor-
ing lung tissue (Fig. 3a). Similarly, Per1, Per2, Bmal1
and Nr1d1 expression was arrhythmic in s.c. B16 tu-
mors (Fig. 3b).
DEX, an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, is well
known to reset cellular clocks by inducing Per gene ex-
pression [39]. Upon repeated addition of DEX, we ob-
served rhythmic Bmal1-Luciferase reporter expression in
slice cultures of explanted B16 lung tumors (Fig. 3c).
Moreover, monitoring of single cells within the same
lung tumor slice indicated an absence of Bmal1 rhythms
before treatment, but circadian oscillation of Bmal1 after
DEX treatment (Additional file 6, Fig. 3d). Thus, DEX
induces de novo rhythmic Bmal1 gene expression in sin-
gle B16 cells rather than synchronizing cellular oscilla-
tors. This is consistent with the single-cell data obtained
on B16 cells in vitro (Fig. 1, Additional files 3 and 4).
To further confirm an activation of the tumor clock by
DEX in vivo, s.c. tumors were injected intra-tumorally
with DEX every 48 h to ensure maintenance of tumor
clock activation. Rhythmic clock gene expression in tu-
mors was found after DEX but not PBS treatment
(Fig. 3e–i). Per1, Per2, Cry1 and Nr1d1 expression showed
a significant effect of time and treatment. Rhythmicity of
Bmal1 mRNA expression did not reach significance
(Fig. 3i). However, the ANOVA analysis showed an effect
of time (see Additional file 1), and immunohistochemistry
on s.c. tumor slices revealed a significant rhythm of
BMAL1 protein levels in DEX-treated tumors, but not in
PBS-treated tumors (Fig. 3j, Additional file 5C, D).
The efficiency and specificity of the intra-tumoral
injections were evaluated by injecting methylene blue in
tumors. The injected fluid spanned the whole tumor
tissue 6 h after intra-tumoral injection, but was absent
in surrounding tissues (Additional file 5E). To further
assess the specificity of the response, clock gene ex-
pression in the liver - a non-cancerous, peripheral
tissue
-
was
compared
between
PBS-
and
DEX-
injected mice: we found no significant differences
between the treatment groups (Additional file 5F).
Altogether, these results indicated that the B16 tumors
harbor a suppressed but inducible circadian oscillator.
Moreover, these experiments showed that repeated DEX
injection consistently induced rhythmic clock gene ex-
pression in B16 tumors rather than re-synchronized
them. The ability to compare the B16 tumors with or
without circadian clock function gave us the opportunity
to test the role of the tumor-intrinsic clock in regulating
cell cycle and tumor growth.
The cell cycle is under circadian control after
dexamethasone treatment of B16 tumors
We measured the expression of cell cycle regulators in
s.c. B16 tumors harvested over 24 h. Similar to the data
obtained in vitro (Fig. 1k–p), rhythmic protein ex-
pression of CYCLIN E, p21 and c-MYC was found in
DEX-treated tumors, but not in PBS-treated tumors
(Fig. 4a–c, Additional file 7A–C). On the other hand,
WEE1, CDK1, CDK2 and p57, a direct glucocorticoid
receptor target [40], did not show a daily variation in
the DEX-treated tumors (Fig. 4d–g).
Homogenized tumor cells collected at different time
points were stained for BrdU incorporation and with
7AAD. The proportion of cells in G0/1 and S phases
was found to be rhythmic in DEX-treated control tu-
mors, whereas PBS-treated tumors showed no circadian
variation (Fig. 4h–j, Additional file 7D). Interestingly,
fewer rhythmic cells entered the S phase in DEX-treated
tumors, indicating less DNA replication, whereas more
cells were found in G0/G1 phases. Importantly, DEX
treatment reduced rather than increased the number of
cells in G0 arrest as indicated by Ki67/7AAD staining in
vitro (see control cells in Additional file 8). Consistent
with results obtained from BrdU stainings, cell numbers in
G1 phase were increased, while cells distributed in S/G2/
M phases were slightly reduced (compare Figs. 2 and 4 and
Additional file 8). Thus, reduced cell numbers after
DEX treatment were not caused by cell cycle arrest.
Moreover, even though entrance to G2/M phase was
not

 index assessed by pHH3 staining indicated a rhythmic
percentage of cells undergoing mitosis (Fig. 4k, Additional
file 7E). Interestingly, cells from DEX-treated tumors
underwent apoptosis in a circadian manner (Fig. 4l,
Additional file 7F).
Dexamethasone treatment slows down B16 tumor growth
Given that activation of the circadian clock in B16 tu-
mors triggered rhythms of cell cycle genes and phases,
we then evaluated whether the activation of clock func-
tion in B16 tumors was paralleled by a reduction in
tumor growth. To this end, s.c. B16 tumor growth was
compared between DEX- and PBS-treated tumors. DEX
treatment significantly slowed down tumor growth (by
~60% after 8 days) compared to PBS treatment (Fig. 4m).
Importantly though, Annexin V staining indicated that
the differences in tumor growth were not due to
differences in the levels of apoptosis, because a similar
proportion of apoptotic cells were found in DEX- and
PBS-treated tumors (when averaged over the 24-h day,
PBS: 14.6 ± 2.3% versus DEX: 11.5 ± 4.6, extra sum-of
squares F-test: p = 0.25; Fig. 4l).
To rule out that reduced tumor growth after DEX
treatment may be caused by DEX-induced immune cell
infiltration in the tumor, we repeated this experiment in
immune-deficient NSG mice, which lack T cells, B cells
and natural killer cells. Similarly to results in C57BL/6J
hosts, tumor growth was strongly reduced by DEX in
NSG mice (Fig. 4n), and no differences were found in
the levels of infiltration of remaining immune cells be-
tween DEX- and PBS-treated tumors in NSG mice
(Additional file 9A–C). Again, the proportion of cells
undergoing apoptosis was not significantly different be-
tween DEX- and PBS-treated tumors collected at Circa-
dian Time (CT)14 in NSG mice (Additional file 9D).
Moreover, the proportions of cells undergoing cell div-
ision (G1/S/G2/M) and of those in G0 arrest were un-
changed by DEX treatment of tumors in NSG mice
(Additional file 9E). Together with results obtained in
vitro that excluded cell cycle arrest (Additional file 8A)
and in C57BL/6J mice that showed more cells in G0/G1
phase at CT14 upon DEX treatment, these results indi-
cated that cells remain more in G1 phase and transit less
to the S phase.
Knockdown of Bmal1 abolishes the effects of
dexamethasone on clock genes and cell cycle genes
To test whether the activation of the clock in B16 tu-
mors is the causal link between DEX treatment and the
inhibition of tumor growth, experiments were repeated
in B16 tumors with a disrupted circadian clock. Using a
lentiviral vector, we stably introduced into B16 cells an
shRNA against Bmal1, a necessary component of the
circadian
clock
[4].
Bmal1
shRNA-transfected
cells
expressed ~80% less Bmal1 RNA and ~65% less BMAL1
protein than Scrambled shRNA control cells (Fig. 5a, b).
B16 cells stably expressing shRNA against Bmal1 or
Scrambled shRNA were injected subcutaneously into
mice to form either tumors lacking a functional clock or
control tumors. Similarly to non-transfected tumors,
clock
gene
expression
showed
significant
circadian
rhythms in DEX-treated but not PBS-treated Scrambled
shRNA tumors (compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 5c–g). In Bmal1
shRNA tumors, Bmal1 expression was reduced by ~70%
in both DEX- and PBS-treated tumors (Fig. 5c). Accord-
ingly, the expression of BMAL1 target genes Per1, Per2,
Cry1 and Nr1d1 was suppressed and arrhythmic, indi-
cating effective disruption of the clock machinery in the
tumors (Fig. 5d–g). Thus, Bmal1 knockdown completely
prevented the induction of circadian rhythms by DEX in
the Bmal1 shRNA tumors.
Rhythmic gene expression of Cyclin E, p21 and c-Myc
was only found in DEX-treated Scrambled shRNA
tumors; Cdk1, Cdk2 and Wee1 did not show a daily
variation, in line with cell cycle protein data (compare
Fig. 5h–m and Fig. 4a–f). Importantly, abrogation of
DEX-induced activation of the circadian clock in Bmal1
shRNA tumors was reflected by the arrhythmic ex-
pression of cell cycle genes in these tumors. Consist-
ently, Bmal1 knockdown in vitro also prevented the
DEX-induced rhythms in cell cycle phases (Additional
file 8A–E).
Knockdown of Bmal1 prevents the inhibitory effect of
dexamethasone on tumor growth
Next we sought to determine whether clock function in
the B16 tumors is needed for DEX-induced reduction in
tumor growth. As expected, B16 tumors expressing the
Scrambled
shRNA
grew
more
slowly
during
DEX
(See figure on previous page.)

 treatment: after 7 days, DEX-treated tumors were ~60%
smaller than PBS-treated tumors (Fig. 5n) and this is
consistent with the growth of untransfected tumors
(Fig. 4m, n). In contrast, tumor volumes were indistin-
guishable between DEX- and PBS-treated mice harbor-
ing Bmal1 shRNA tumors (Fig. 5n). Thus, DEX had no
effect on tumor growth after Bmal1 knockdown. Vol-
ume doubling time analysis of Scrambled and Bmal1
shRNA tumors confirmed
these
results
(Scrambled
shRNA: PBS: 53.3 h, DEX: 84.0 h; Bmal1 shRNA: PBS:
50.1 h, DEX: 50.0 h). Similar results were obtained in
vitro using Bmal1 and Scrambled shRNA-transfected
cells (data not shown).
Consistent with the data obtained using NSG mice
(Fig. 4n), DEX did not affect the levels of immune cell
infiltration in B16 tumors inoculated in the syngeneic
C57BL/6J mice or in Bmal1 knockdown tumors, indi-
cated by similar values for B cells, dendritic cells, CD4+
and CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and mono-
cytes (Additional file 8F–L). These data confirmed that
the slower tumor growth was not caused by effects of
DEX on immune cell infiltration. Overall, these findings
are in strong support of the notion that activating
circadian clock function within B16 tumors slows down
their growth.
Enhancement of circadian rhythms slows down HCT-116
tumor growth
To test the link between the circadian clock and tumor
growth beyond our model using mouse melanoma, we
treated human HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells with
DEX and measured clock gene expression as well as pro-
liferation and apoptosis up to 48 h after the treatment.
HCT-116 cells exhibited rhythmic clock gene expres-
sion upon DEX treatment (Fig. 6a, b), which could be
due
to
either
synchronization
of
individual
cells’
clocks or de novo activation of clocks in the cells.
Upon this treatment HCT-116 cell proliferation was
strongly decreased while apoptosis levels were un-
affected (Fig. 6c, d).
Similar to the B16 s.c. tumors in C57BL/6 J and NSG
mice, growth of tumors formed in NSG mice after HCT-
116 cell inoculation was strongly slowed down after
DEX treatment (Fig. 6e). These data underscore the
possibility that controlling cell division rate by circadian
clock enhancement and thus controlling tumor growth
is not restricted to mouse melanoma cells, and may be
generally applicable to human cancer cells and to other
cancer types.
Discussion
In this report, we showed that B16 melanoma cells and
B16 tumors have suppressed expression of clock compo-
nents, which is in line with previous reports on different
cancer cell lines and tumors [21–23]. However, we dis-
covered that different treatments could restore clock
gene expression in B16 cells and tumors. This provided
an experimental model in which the same tumor type
could be compared in conditions of inactive or active
circadian oscillator function. Using this model, we
showed that restoring clock function in B16 melanoma
cells strongly reduced cell proliferation in vitro and
tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 7). We also extended our ob-
servations to another cancer cell model, the human
colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells. In all of the in vivo
tumor experiments, a strong slowdown of tumor growth
was observed, with a two thirds reduction of tumor size
after 8 days of treatment, regardless of the host or
cancer cell line used.
The amplitude
of
clock
gene
rhythmicity
within
tumors was previously correlated with their growth in
mice bearing Glasgow osteosarcoma [22] and pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [15]. Furthermore, a dysregulated circa-
dian tumor clock in human patients correlated with
their prognosis [25, 41]. Together, these prior studies in-
dicate that the tumor clock may have an impact on
tumor growth and overall survival (also reviewed in
(See figure on previous page.)

 [42]). However, until our present report, a causal link
was missing to solidify the importance of the tumor
clock
itself,
as
opposed
to
host-derived
circadian
rhythms. Previous studies showed that glucocorticoids
suppress proliferation in human melanoma cells and
B16 tumors after intraperitoneal DEX injection in mice
[28, 43]. Importantly, our data provide a cellular mech-
anism for these effects. In contrast to prior work, our
data were generated using intra-tumor injection of DEX
restricted to the tumor and at low doses. Furthermore,
we
showed
an
absence
of
effects
on
clock
gene
expression in the liver. Thus, our work is the first to
show a tumor-intrinsic mechanism for the control of
tumor growth by the circadian clock. Moreover, the ef-
fects of restored synchronous circadian rhythmicity on
tumor growth also extend to a distinct tumor cell model,
the human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells, although in
the case of these cells we cannot exclude a role of DEX
in synchronizing the clocks in individual cells rather
than an activation of the cellular clocks.

 or tumor model used [44–47]. Nevertheless, and in line
with previous reports on fibroblasts [44], we found no or
minor effects of DEX, FSK or heat shock on apoptosis in
B16 cells. Thus, in our experiments, the activation of
circadian clock function in tumors resulted in reduced
growth independently of deregulated apoptosis. Given
the immune-modulating properties of glucocorticoids
[48], we also aimed to exclude an effect of DEX on the
immune cell content of the tumors as the cause of the
observed decrease in tumor growth. Notably, immune
cell content was not changed by the intra-tumoral DEX
treatment. Moreover, the effect of DEX on tumor growth
was recapitulated in NSG mice, which lack T cells, B
cells and natural killer cells, further strengthening our
Fig. 7 Model for the suppressive effect of clock activation on tumor growth. Untreated cancer cells harbor an inactive circadian clock and exhibit
fast cell cycle progression and fast tumor growth (left). Dexamethasone (DEX), Forskolin (FSK), serum shock or heat shock activate the circadian
clock in cancer cells, which regulates circadian expression of cell cycle checkpoint genes (in particular factors regulating G1-to-S transition), which
results in slower tumor growth (right). Treatment of cancer cells transfected with Bmal1 shRNA does not result in an activation of the circadian
clock and thus no rhythmic cell cycle gene expression, which results in fast tumor growth (left). See Discussion for details

 claim. In order to directly test the hypothesis that DEX
inhibits tumor growth via the tumor-intrinsic circadian
clock, we used shRNA against the essential clock gene
Bmal1. The response to DEX was abrogated in B16
tumors with a Bmal1 knockdown. Thus, the suppressive
DEX effect on B16 proliferation and tumor growth
requires a functional clock within B16 cells. It is unlikely
that Bmal1 knockdown affects the response to DEX
itself, because Bmal1 dysfunction did not interfere
with glucocorticoid receptor expression as observed
in transcriptome datasets [49–51]. Of note, we ob-
served a similar induction of circadian rhythms and
inhibition of B16 cell proliferation in vitro following
other treatments besides DEX, as well as with a non-
pharmacological treatment, heat shock. Serum, DEX,
FSK and heat shock all reset cellular clocks by indu-
cing clock genes such as Per genes [30, 39, 52], but
different signaling pathways are involved: DEX acti-
vates Per1 via the glucocorticoid receptor [53], but
DEX can also synchronize the circadian clock via
glucocorticoid receptor-independent pathways, as was
shown for HCT-116 cells [33]; FSK activates the
cAMP/protein kinase A pathway, and thus, cAMP
response element-binding protein activity at the Per1
promoter [54]; and heat shock activates Per2 tran-
scription via heat shock factor 1 [30]. Given that
these treatments similarly activate the clock by mech-
anisms distinct from DEX, this further suggests a
clock-dependent action of DEX.
Taken together our results indicate that reduced
tumor growth after DEX treatment was not caused by
enhanced apoptosis, nor immune infiltration in the
tumor, but rather relies specifically on inducing circa-
dian rhythms within the tumor. For the first time,
our work unveils a causal relationship between the
tumor-intrinsic
circadian
clock
and
tumor
growth
(Fig. 7).
Our findings raise the question of how the activation
of circadian clock function in B16 cells leads to inhib-
ition of tumor growth. The circadian clock has been
shown to regulate cell cycle genes and, thus, progres-
sion through the cell cycle [2]. Indeed, we identified
rhythmic cell cycle genes after induction of clock
function in B16 cells and tumors. In particular, Cyclin
E, p21 and c-Myc exhibited circadian oscillations at
the mRNA and protein levels. CLOCK-BMAL1 re-
presses c-Myc, an activator of Cyclin E [16, 55], and
another clock component, NR1D1, inhibits the syn-
thesis of the CDK inhibitor p21 [56]. Thus, restored
expression of the major clock components in B16
tumors likely accounts for the observed changes in
cell cycle gene expression.
Our data indicate that the circadian gating distributes
more B16 cells in the G1 phase (and not more arrest of
cells in the G0 phase) and fewer in the S phase, which
prolongs the transit through the cell cycle and may ac-
count for the observed lengthening of the PDT. Thus,
fewer cells initiated DNA replication, which could under-
lie the observed reduced tumor growth. In line with our
observations, accumulation in cell cycle phases such as
G1 or G2 was reported to slow down proliferation in hu-
man melanoma cells [43]. G1-to-S transit is regulated by
cell cycle checkpoint regulators, in particular the Cyclin
E/CDK2 complex [57]. Importantly we have identified
rhythmic expression of the inhibitor p21, c-MYC and a
component of this checkpoint complex itself, Cyclin E.
Consequently, rhythmic regulation of the Cyclin E/Cdk2
complex may result in a prolonged stay in the G1 phase.
Taken together, rhythmic changes in expression levels of
Cyclin E, p21 and c-MYC after activation of the clock
by DEX likely caused the observed redistribution of
B16 cells among cell cycle phases (Fig. 7). Moreover,
our results highlight a possible strategy of B16 melan-
oma cells to facilitate their proliferation: suppression
of the circadian clock induces changes in their cell
cycle, which leads to increased residence time in the
S phase and an enhancement of DNA replication and
thus cell proliferation.
Conclusions
Glucocorticoids have been used to treat various can-
cer types for decades, in many cases as an adjuvant
to other chemotherapies [58]. While potential mecha-
nisms have been described in different cell types,
exactly how glucocorticoids regulate apoptosis or cell
cycle progression is not fully understood [59, 60].
Our work indicates a possible mechanism (capable of
explaining existing data) for how glucocorticoids can
inhibit cancer cell proliferation, namely by inducing
circadian rhythms in cancer cell cycle events to limit
the number of cells in the S phase and thereby
increase the time spent in the G1 phase. Therefore,
our work opens new windows of opportunity in can-
cer therapy based on chronobiological intervention.
For example, activation of the clock in tumors may
represent a new therapeutic target for malignant mel-
anoma therapy in humans. Because our observations
extended to human colon cancer cells, this strategy
might more generally become an innovative way to
slow down cancer progression and thereby improve
the
outcome
of
established
anti-cancer
therapies.
Slowing down tumor progression by improving circa-
dian rhythmicity might critically delay cancer progres-
sion and/or metastasis. This could in turn increase
treatment success with traditional chemotherapy or
provide a broader time window for surgical resection
of tumors.
