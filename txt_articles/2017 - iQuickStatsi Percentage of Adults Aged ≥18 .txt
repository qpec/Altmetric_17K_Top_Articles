† Based on a positive response to the question “During the past 3 months, did you have a severe headache 
 
or migraine?”  
§ Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population 
and are derived from the National Health Interview Survey Sample Adult component.
In 2015, 20.0% of women and 9.7% of men aged ≥18 years had a severe headache or migraine in the past 3 months. Overall 
and for each age group, women aged ≥18 years were more likely than men to have had a severe headache or migraine in the 
past 3 months. For both sexes, a report of a severe headache or migraine in the the past 3 months decreased with advancing 
age, from 11.0% among men aged 18–44 years to 3.4% among men aged ≥75 years and from 24.7% among women aged 
18–44 years to 6.3% among women aged ≥75 years.
