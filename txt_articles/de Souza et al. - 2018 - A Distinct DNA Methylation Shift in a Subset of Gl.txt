SUMMARY
Glioma diagnosis is based on histomorphology and
grading; however, such classification does not have
predictive
clinical
outcome
after
glioblastomas
have developed. To date, no bona fide biomarkers
that significantly translate into a survival benefit to
glioblastoma patients have been identified. We pre-
viously reported that the IDH mutant G-CIMP-high
subtype would be a predecessor to the G-CIMP-
low subtype. Here, we performed a comprehensive
DNA methylation longitudinal analysis of diffuse gli-
omas from 77 patients (200 tumors) to enlighten
the epigenome-based malignant transformation of
initially lower-grade gliomas. Intra-subtype hetero-
geneity among G-CIMP-high primary tumors allowed
us to identify predictive biomarkers for assessing the
risk of malignant recurrence at early stages of dis-
ease. G-CIMP-low recurrence appeared in 9.5% of
all gliomas, and these resembled IDH-wild-type pri-
mary glioblastoma. G-CIMP-low recurrence can be
characterized by distinct epigenetic changes at
candidate functional tissue enhancers with AP-1/
SOX binding elements, mesenchymal stem cell-like
epigenomic phenotype, and genomic instability. Mo-
lecular abnormalities of longitudinal G-CIMP offer
possibilities to defy glioblastoma progression.
INTRODUCTION
Heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in IDH1/2 (isocitrate
dehydrogenase (NADP(+) 1/2; IDH) is traditionally a hallmark of
a subset of gliomas associated with favorable patient outcomes
(Parsons et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009). Mutant IDH protein pro-
duces the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which
may establish the glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype
(G-CIMP) (Noushmehr et al., 2010) by presumably extensive re-
modeling of the tumor methylome (Turcan et al., 2012). The
incorporation of IDH mutation status into the classical histopa-
thology and grading system by the updated 2016 World Health
Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the CNS repre-
sents an emerging concept in which diagnosis of diffuse gliomas
should be structured and refined in the molecular taxonomy era
(Louis et al., 2016; Malta et al., 2017). Although IDH mutation is
retained upon glioma recurrence (Bai et al., 2016; Mazor et al.,
2015), mutant IDH1 may convert from driver to passenger (Jo-
hannessen et al., 2016), and, in some patients, neither mutant
IDH1 nor the oncometabolite 2HG are strictly required for clonal
expansion at recurrence (Mazor et al., 2017).
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer and
accounts for 46.6% of primary malignant brain tumors with a

 5-year overall survival estimate post-diagnosis of 5.5% (Ostrom
et al., 2016). The WHO histomorphology and grading classifica-
tion of diffuse gliomas does not have predictive clinical out-
comes after GBMs have developed (Louis et al., 2016; Sanai
et al., 2011). Treating initially lower-grade glioma (LGG) that re-
lapses and undergoes malignant transformation to GBM is one
of the greatest challenges in neuro-oncology (Stupp et al.,
2005, 2009). To date, despite the efforts of the neuro-oncology
community, no treatment regimens or bona fide biomarkers
that significantly translate into a survival benefit to GBM patients
have been identified.
Widespread genetic alterations of high-grade gliomas have
been extensively examined. Mutational branching models’
assumption of divergence time in GBM suggested that recur-
rence-associated clones diverged from untreated clones years
before diagnosis (Wang et al., 2016). The mutational landscape
of multisector and/or long-term recurrent malignant glioma
biopsies can inform therapy-driven evolution and personalized
targeted therapies in GBM (Johnson et al., 2014; Kim et al.,
2015; Lee et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016). Frequent genomic
chromothripsis events and the later acquired DNA mismatch
repair deficiency by GBM cells may positively select for treat-
ment-resistant clones (Erson-Omay et al., 2017).
Epigenetics refers to differential control of gene expression
and alternate cellular phenotypes that are not coded in the indi-
vidual’s DNA sequence but, rather, determined by chromatin
structure, particularly via covalent modifications of DNA (DNA
methylation) and histone proteins (Sharma et al., 2010). Epige-
netically based molecular classification of 932 adult diffuse
primary gliomas (WHO grades II to IV) analyzed by our group un-
covered the existence of three cohesive molecular subtypes of
IDH mutant gliomas (Codel, G-CIMP-high, and G-CIMP-low)
and four subtypes of IDH-wild-type gliomas (classic-like,
mesenchymal-like, LGm6-GBM, and pilocytic astrocytoma
[PA]-like) with characteristic patient outcomes. Accordingly,
IDH mutant non-Codel DNA methylation signatures allowed
the segregation of LGG-GBM G-CIMP tumors into two discrete
disease subtypes independent of neuropathological grading
(G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low). The G-CIMP-low subtype ac-
counts for 6% of all IDH mutant diffuse primary gliomas and is
characterized by lower levels of DNA methylation at specific
CpG signatures and an unfavorable overall survival relative to
the G-CIMP-high subtype, which accounts for 55% of all IDH
mutant diffuse primary gliomas (Ceccarelli et al., 2016). By eval-
uating a small cohort of matched primary and recurrent diffuse
gliomas, we recently reported that the G-CIMP-high subtype
would be a predecessor to the G-CIMP-low subtype, which
suggested a disease progression model relative to G-CIMP
(Ceccarelli et al., 2016). However, the critical question of
whether the spatial and temporal dynamics of epimethyl pat-
terns of G-CIMP offer new possibilities for assessing the risk
of malignant recurrence at early stages of glioma evolution to
defy glioma progression remains unresolved. Comprehensive
evolution of initially LGG G-CIMP methylomes throughout the
course of cell-malignant transformation to GBMs has potential
clinical implications for identifying predictive biomarkers to
abrogate the establishment, recurrence, and progression of a
malignant glioma phenotype.
RESULTS
Samples and Clinical Data
A summary of clinical data is represented in Tables 1 and 2 and
reflects our effort to manually update the available information at
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Biospecimen Core Resource
(BCR) combined with published datasets (Mazor et al., 2015; Bai
et al., 2016; Mazor et al., 2017) and our own cohort with known
IDH mutation and 1p-19q (short arm of chromosome 1 and
long arm of chromosome 19) co-deletion status. The majority
of samples were IDH mutant non-Codel at primary (54 of 74;
72.97%) and first recurrence (50 of 69; 72.46%) surgery time
points. Stratification of histology and grading among the IDH
mutant non-Codel cases included astrocytoma grade II as pri-
mary (47; 87.04%) as well as anaplastic astrocytoma grade III
(18; 36%) and glioblastoma grade IV (19; 38%) at first
recurrence.
Spatial and Temporal Epimethyl Pattern Dynamics
of Evolution in Adult Diffuse Longitudinal Gliomas
Our group and others reported the widespread differences in
DNA methylation in adult diffuse primary gliomas (Sturm et al.,
2012; Brat et al., 2015; Ceccarelli et al., 2016). We previously
grouped primary gliomas into two IDH-driven macro-clusters
eventually leading to the identification of three IDH mutant-spe-
cific DNA methylation subtypes (Codel, G-CIMP-high, and
G-CIMP-low) and three IDH wild-type-specific DNA methylation
subtypes (classic-like, mesenchymal-like, and LGm6). Based on
the molecular similarity with PAs, LGG tumors classified as LGm6
pan-glioma DNA methylation subtype were further labeled as
PA-like. Additionally, the GBMs falling into this group were best
described as LGm6-GBM for their original pan-glioma DNA
methylation cluster and tumor grade (Ceccarelli et al., 2016).
TCGA adult diffuse glioma samples not classified in our pub-
lished analysis (n = 39, 9 primary and 30 recurrent), in addition
to 20 primary cases previously included, were classified into
one of the 7 DNA methylation subtypes. To do this, we applied
a random forest (RF) machine learning prediction model using
our defined DNA methylation probe signatures described in
Ceccarelli et al. (2016): IDH mutant tumor-specific (n = 1,308),
IDH mutant subtypes (n = 163), and IDH-wild-type tumor-spe-
cific (n = 914). We extended our analysis by similarly assigning
each tumor sample in the non-TCGA published longitudinal
cohorts (Mazor et al., 2015, 2017, n = 81; Bai et al., 2016,
n = 48) to one of the DNA methylation subtypes. Additionally,
we profiled and classified a total of 12 primary and recurrent
glioma samples generated from our own cohort and predicted
the IDH and 1p-19q statuses of 9 tumor fragments derived
from biopsies of 3 distinct patients (Tables S1 and S2). To do
this, we integrated an additional set of 1,300 tumor-specific
probes that discriminated the pan-glioma primary cohort into
two macro groups: the LGm1/LGm2/LGm3 DNA methylation
macro group harboring the IDH1 or IDH2 mutation versus the
LGm4/LGm5/LGm6 DNA methylation macro group comprising
glioma samples carrying IDH-wild-type (Ceccarelli et al., 2016).
Therefore, we examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of
DNA methylomes of 200 longitudinally collected TCGA and
non-TCGA gliomas from 77 patients profiled on the Illumina

 HumanMethylation450 bead arrays (450,000) platform. Of the
200 glioma fragments, 132 (66%) were classified as G-CIMP-
high, 20 (10%) were classified as Codel, 19 (9.5%) were classi-
fied as G-CIMP-low, 12 (6%) were classified as mesenchymal-
like, 11 (5.5%) were classified as classic-like, 5 (2.5%) were
classified as PA-like, and 1 (0.5%) was classified as LGm6-
GBM by supervised RF computational approaches with high
specificity and sensitivity (accuracy > 95% on average) (Figures
1A and 1B; Table S1).
Despite harboring the IDH mutation, primary tumors that belong
to the G-CIMP-low subtype were reported to have lower DNA
methylation levels and worse clinical outcomes in relation to pri-
mary tumors that belong to the G-CIMP-high subtype (Ceccarelli
et al., 2016). A 3D scatterplot using G-CIMP-low and G-CIMP-
high indices predicted by the RF model (Figure 1A) allowed us to
visualize the phenotypic relationships of G-CIMP-positive longitu-
dinal tumors, suggesting a distinct set of samples within the
IDH mutant non-Codel G-CIMP subtypes that showed relatively
intermediate DNA methylation profiles at a G-CIMP-low index
thresholdof< 0.5 and R 0.2 and ata G-CIMP-high index threshold
ofR0.5and<0.75.WenamedthissubgroupofsamplesG-CIMP-
intermediate post-RF assessment (i.e., n = 3 primary, n = 8 first
recurrent, and n = 3 second recurrent tumor fragments derived
from 11 distinct patients). The G-CIMP-intermediate subgroup
was characterized by a modest degree of DNA methylation
changes trending toward the G-CIMP-low subtype (Figures 1A
and 2A;Table S1).ThismaysuggestthatG-CIMP-intermediate re-
flects an early-stage transition from G-CIMP-high to G-CIMP-low.
Notably, we demonstrated a dramatic epigenomic shift toward
malignant progression from G-CIMP-high at primary to G-CIMP-
low at first recurrence in 9 patients (Figure 2A). Although all G-
CIMP-low tumors at first recurrence were grade IV, not all grade
IV tumors transitioned to G-CIMP-low, suggesting that grade
may not be the only indicator of G-CIMP-low progression (Fig-
ure 2A). We did not observe any significant changes in the IDH
mutant Codel and IDH-wild-type glioma subtypes in terms of their
epigenomic profile toward recurrent disease (Figures S1A and
S1B; Table S1).
Acquisition of an IDH-Wild-Type and Stem Cell-like GBM
Phenotype by G-CIMP-Low at Recurrence
G-CIMP-low primary tumors showed a molecular signature
associated with a stem cell-like phenotype at DNA binding motifs
for SOX transcription factors (TFs) with the worst overall clinical
outcomes within the IDH mutant non-Codel genotype (Ceccarelli
et al., 2016). To explore the relationship of stemness and
G-CIMP malignant transformation, we applied the DNA methyl-
ation-based stemness index (mDNAsi) to categorize our adult

 diffuse glioma longitudinal cohort according to its degree of un-
differentiation as a function of glioma malignancy (Figures 2A
and 2B). Briefly, mDNAsi is a score value resulting from a concat-
enation of three stemness signatures (a total of 219 probes)
mainly defined by using 450,000 DNA methylation profiles and
a one-class logistic regression predictive model (Malta et al.,
2018) on human stem/progenitor cells and their differentiated
progeny from the Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC)
(Daily et al., 2017; Salomonis et al., 2016). mDNAsi ranges
from zero to one and provided a relative metric to classify a total
of 9,627 TCGA samples across 33 distinct tumor types accord-
ing to their stem cell-like prevalence (stemness). mDNAsi was
able to recapitulate known features of stemness in the IDH-
wild-type, mesenchymal-like, and classic-like subtypes (Malta
et al., 2018). Therefore, mDNAsi applied to our longitudinal
G-CIMP progression model provided an independent relative
metric to estimate progression in gliomas independent of grade
and known overall survival predictors (Figures 2A and 2B). We
showed that IDH-wild-type primary and first recurrent tumors
had the highest overall stemness index (medians of 0.23 and
0.2, respectively) compared with the entire IDH mutant cohort
at primary and first recurrence (medians of 0.1 and 0.14, respec-
tively); however, the degree of stemness within IDH-wild-type
shifted from primary to first recurrence (p = 0.05) (Figure 2B),
suggesting that IDH-wild-type recurrent gliomas may be defined
by expansion of a resistant clone that is more differentiated yet
aggressive in nature, as reported for metastatic melanoma cells
(Cheli et al., 2011). Interestingly, G-CIMP-low first recurrent
tumors showed a higher overall stemness index in relation to
their G-CIMP-high primary counterparts (p < 0.0001; medians
of 0.22 and 0.1, respectively). Compared with G-CIMP-high first
recurrent tumors, the landscape of the stemness index in
G-CIMP-low first recurrent tumors highly resembled those found
in IDH-wild-type primary GBMs (p < 0.0001; medians of 0.1 and
0.2, respectively) (Figure 2B). Therefore, we defined a subset of
G-CIMP-low tumors that acquire a stem cell-like phenotype
upon first recurrence, suggesting that a stem cell-like aggressive
tumor behavior may exist within IDH mutant non-Codel and
contribute to their resistance to adjuvant therapy and relapse
as the G-CIMP-low phenotype (Figure 2A).

 potential to support therapeutic resistance, recurrence, and the
progressive growth of tumors (Lathia et al., 2015; Singh et al.,
2004; Vescovi et al., 2006). G-CIMP tumors were found to belong
to the proneural gene expression subtype of gliomas (Noush-
mehr et al., 2010; Verhaak et al., 2010), and, interestingly, a
mathematical model of GBM evolution suggested that most
non-G-CIMP mesenchymal GBMs evolve from a proneural-like
precursor downstream of chromosome (chr) 7 gain and chr10
loss, followed by CDKN2A loss and/or TP53 mutation (Ozawa
et al., 2014). A subtype transition from proneural to the aggres-
sive GBM mesenchymal pattern was documented upon therapy
resistance and re-occurrence of the disease (Bhat et al., 2013;
Phillips et al., 2006). In line with this, we sought to determine
whether the acquisition of an IDH-wild-type stem cell-like GBM
phenotype by G-CIMP-low at first recurrence showed molecular
similarity to mesenchymal cell differentiation.
Supervised analysis of DNA methylation of de novo (primary)
G-CIMP-low (n = 12) and acquired (first recurrent) G-CIMP-low
(n = 9) showed that, even though these tumors shared epige-
nome-wide features, G-CIMP-low primary and recurrent meth-
ylomes were distinguished by 84 differentially methylated
probes (58 hypomethylated CpGs in G-CIMP-low primary
and 26 hypomethylated CpGs in G-CIMP-low recurrent, false
discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05, absolute difference in mean
methylation beta value > 0.2) (Figures 3A–3C; Table S3).
Most of the hypomethylated probes at primary (44, 75.86%)
were located within intergenic regions known as open seas,
whereas the hypomethylated probes at first recurrence were
equally distributed between genomic regions of 2,000 bp up-
stream and downstream, flanking CpG island (CGI) boundaries
known as shores (10, 38.46%) and intergenic open sea re-
gions (11, 42.31%) (Figure 3D).
In-depth known motif analysis of G-CIMP-low methylomes led
to the identification of DNA signature motifs for ETV1 (50-AACCG
GAAGT-30) at CpG sites hypomethylated in G-CIMP-low primary
and STAT3 (50-CTTCCGGGAA-30) at CpG sites hypomethylated
in G-CIMP-low recurrent (geometric test; p = 1e�2; fold enrich-
ment of 1.99 and 4.36, respectively) (Figures 3E and 3F). STAT3
is known to be the master regulator of mesenchymal differentia-
tion in glioma cells (Carro et al., 2010), and, hence, this provides
meaningful insights into the evolution of G-CIMP-low recurrent
cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage transformation
and into the unfavorable patient outcomes because these tumors
can emerge as secondary GBMs. ETV1 oncoprotein was reported
to induce the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like
metastatic progression and increased invasiveness/aggressive-
ness of gastric adenocarcinomas by upregulation of SNAIL
expression, a classical EMT driver gene (Li et al., 2013).
Therefore, the establishment of a G-CIMP-low methylome in
primary gliomas may occur in a cell-intrinsic manner, whereas
the establishment of a G-CIMP-low methylome in malignant
recurrent gliomas may reflect the response of transformed cells
to epigenetics-selective pressure in the tumor microenviron-
ment, possibly a response to therapy. This provides the lay basis
to not only support the notion that G-CIMP-low at primary and
G-CIMP-low at recurrence can be considered two separate tu-
mor entities but also to hypothesize that, despite heterogeneous
molecular alterations, epigenetic events during G-CIMP-low
evolution converged toward the aberrant mesenchymal lineage
transformation at primary and recurrence.
G-CIMP-High to G-CIMP-Low Malignant Transformation
Is Defined by Epigenomic Changes at Genomic
Biofeatures Associated with Glioma Progression and
Normal Development
We performed a supervised analysis to determine distinct epige-
netic changes between the groups defined by a glioma subtype
shift (Figures 2A and S1; Table S1). We did not identify any sig-
nificant epigenetic difference between IDH-wild-type primary
and recurrent gliomas and IDH mutant Codel primary and recur-
rent gliomas (Figures S1A and S1B; Table S1). Using a core set of
9 cases that significantly shift their DNA methylation patterns
from G-CIMP-high at initial (primary) diagnosis to G-CIMP-low
at first recurrence (Figure 2A; Table S1), we identified 684
differentially hypomethylated CpG probes and 28 differentially
hypermethylated CpG probes (FDR < 0.05, difference in mean
methylation beta value > 0.5 and < �0.4) associated with
G-CIMP-low recurrence (Figure 4A; Table S4). When we
compared these 712 G-CIMP-low signatures at recurrence
with non-tumor, normal neuronal cells and normal glial cells,
we observed that the G-CIMP-high (primary and first recurrent)
tumors were normal-like, contrary to what we found for
G-CIMP-low recurrent tumors and grade IV IDH-wild-type (pri-
mary and recurrent) GBMs. Therefore, the 712 G-CIMP-low
recurrent CpG signatures were able to stratify IDH mutant non-
Codel G-CIMP tumors exhibiting progressed disease and highly
aggressive (IDH wild-type-like) phenotypes (Figure 4A). This
finding (Figure 4A), combined with our stemness and G-CIMP-
low evolution analyses (Figures 2 and 3), demonstrated that
G-CIMP-low recurrent tumors shared epigenetic characteristics
with IDH-wild-type primary GBMs. Although all G-CIMP-low
tumors were classified as grade IV (10 of 20 IDH mutant GBMs
Figure 1. Identification of Longitudinal Tumors with a G-CIMP-High to G-CIMP-Low Epigenetics Shift during Recurrence and Malignant
Tumor Progression
The methylomes of 200 longitudinally collected TCGA and non-TCGA adult diffuse gliomas (grades II to IV) from 77 patients profiled on the 450,000 platform were
classified by supervised random forest (RF) computational approaches into one of the 7 pan-glioma DNA methylation subtypes (accuracy > 95% on average)
using the CpG probe signatures described in Ceccarelli et al. (2016).
(A) This 3D scatterplot using IDH mutant Codel (negative control of G-CIMP signatures) and IDH mutant non-Codel G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low indices
predicted by the RF model shows a distinct set of samples within the IDH mutant non-Codel G-CIMP subtypes exhibiting relatively intermediate DNA methylation
profiles. This subgroup of samples has been named G-CIMP-intermediate post-RF assessment. A subset of initially LGG G-CIMP-high tumors switches to a
G-CIMP-low phenotype at first recurrence, whereas a subset of tumors retains their original G-CIMP-high phenotype at first recurrence as a form of epigenetic
memory.
(B) 3D scatterplot using IDH-wild-type PA-like, classic-like, and mesenchymal-like indices predicted by RF shows that IDH-wild-type gliomas do not change
significantly in terms of their DNA methylation patterns during disease relapse.

 at first recurrence, 50%), not all IDH mutant grade IV first recur-
rent gliomas progressed to the G-CIMP-low phenotype; in fact,
35% (7 of 20) of grade IV IDH mutant gliomas at first recurrence
were classified as G-CIMP-high, whereas 15% (3 of 20) were
classified as G-CIMP-intermediate tumors (Figure 2A). To eval-
uate whether there were differences within grade IV G-CIMPs,
we performed a supervised DNA methylation analysis between
grade IV G-CIMP-low at first recurrence (n = 9, change) and
grade IV G-CIMP-high at first recurrence (n = 6, no change).
We observed 350 differentially methylated probes (Wilcoxon
rank-sum test, p < 0.01; difference in mean methylation beta
value < �0.4 and > 0.5; Figure S2). Collectively, these findings
suggest that G-CIMP-high to G-CIMP-low follows an alternative
epigenetic roadmap toward disease relapse independent of
grade (Figures 2, 3, 4A, and S2).
CpG sites exhibiting DNA hypermethylation in G-CIMP-low at
first recurrence were significantly enriched for CGIs (odds ratio
[OR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–3.58), bivalent
chromatin domains (OR = 3.61, 95% CI: 1.87–6.98), and chr21
(OR = 8.17, 95% CI: 1.95–34.32) (Figure 4B, p < 0.05 [enriched]).
We also observed a depletion of probes positioned within inter-
genic regions or open seas (OR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10–0.85)

were significantly enriched for open seas (OR = 1.70, 95% CI:

and chr1, chr7, chr10, chr12, and chr16 (OR > 1.0) (Figure 4C,

probes located at CGIs (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.09–0.19), shores

(OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.38–0.69), non-enhancer elements (OR =

(OR < 0.3) (Figure 4C, p < 0.05 [depleted]).
Genomic abnormalities pertaining to chromosomes 1, 7, 10, 12,
and 19 were documented in gliomas (Brennan et al., 2013; Brat
et al., 2015). Chromothripsis events affecting chr1, chr7, and
chr12 with a high level of amplification were found in high-grade
gliomas (Erson-Omay et al., 2017). Recently, a functional study
showed that chr7 gain is a repeated genomic event in glioma
stem cell lines from primary and multiple sections of tumors at
recurrence in a GBM patient, which correlated to the tissue-wide
expansion of a new clone in the recurrent tumor (Baysan et al.,
2017). Taken together, these findings suggest that chromosomal
alterations may contribute down the road of tumor evolution in a
rare subgroup of LGG CIMP gliomas progressing to GBMs.
The majority of CpG sites that underwent a massive DNA de-
methylation in G-CIMP-low relapsed tumors were primarily
found within intergenic open sea regions (558 of 684, 81.58%)
(Figures 4A and 4C), a finding consistent with our previous study
of primary G-CIMP-high and primary G-CIMP-low tumors (Cec-
carelli et al., 2016). By aggregating chromatin hidden Markov
model (chromHMM) data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics
Consortium (Kundaje et al., 2015) with the 712 differentially
methylated regions (DMRs) identified in G-CIMP-low progressed
tumors, we observed these genomic elements to be functionally
relevant in defining differentiated adult tissue phenotypes and
pluripotency in stem cells (Figure S3). Loss of CpG methylation
at these known functional genomic elements associated with
normal development and pluripotency defines a possible mech-
anism of glioma progression that may lead to improved targeted
therapy against the G-CIMP-low tumor phenotype.
DNA methylation signatures of multiple disease-related genes
and intergenic regions have been related to mortality outcomes
(Zhang et al., 2017), providing evidence for the collaborative role
of DNA methylation and non-coding functional regions in the
modulation of cell phenotypes. For a more functional view of
the recurring patterns in hypomethylated DNA that are presumed
to have sequence binding-specific sites for TFs implicated in
tumor relapse and progression to G-CIMP-low (n = 684 CpG
sites), we performed de novo and known DNA motif scan ana-
lyses. The top ranked de novo motif signature, 50-TGA{G/C}
TCA-30 (geometric test, p = 1e�16, fold enrichment = 3.04), cor-
responded to known motifs associated with the TFs JUN/AP-1
(geometric test, q = 0, fold enrichment = 2.86), FOSL2 (geometric
test, q = 0, fold enrichment = 2.42), FRA1 (geometric test, q = 0,
fold enrichment = 2.01), BATF (geometric test, q = 2e-4, fold
enrichment = 1.72), ATF3 (geometric test, q = 4e-4, fold enrich-
ment = 1.67), and AP1 (geometric test, q = 7e-4, fold enrich-
ment = 1.60). AP-1 (activating protein-1) is a collective term refer-
ring to homodimeric or heterodimeric TFs composed of basic
region-leucine zipper (bZIP) protein JUN, FOS, or ATF subfam-
ilies. AP-1 is involved in cellular proliferation, transformation,
and death (Shaulian and Karin, 2002). We found that AP-1 may
significantly bind to probes of demethylated DNA (80 of 684,
Figure 2. Acquisition of an IDH-Wild-Type and Stem Cell-like GBM Phenotype by G-CIMP-Low at Recurrence
An overview of the longitudinal glioma cohort (n = 77 patients) across all tissue source sites is shown and highlights the stratification of glioma patients according
to the temporal epigenomic profile dynamics of their tumors from initial (primary) diagnosis to first recurrent disease.
(A) A subset within the IDH mutant non-Codel G-CIMP-high subtype that retains their original epigenomics phenotype at first recurrent disease (o change), a
subset within the IDH mutant non-Codel macro group manifesting the G-CIMP-intermediate DNA methylation profile at primary and/or recurrent diseases plus a
subset within the IDH mutant non-Codel macro group exhibiting the G-CIMP-low phenotype at second recurrence (these patients are collectively defined as
those showing intermediate changes in their epigenomic profiles), and a subset within the IDH mutant non-Codel macro group (n = 9 patients) showing a dramatic
epigenomic shift toward malignant transformation from G-CIMP-high at primary to G-CIMP-low at first recurrence (change). Adult diffuse longitudinal gliomas are
categorized according to their stem cell-like prevalence/degree of undifferentiation (stemness) by using the DNA methylation-based stemness index (mDNAsi) as
relative metric (a score value from 0 to 1). Each box represents a patient tumor colored according to its mDNAsi at primary and recurrent stages of the disease.
When multiple tumor fragments are available per surgical resection, mDNAsi represents an average value of geographically distinct tumor pieces derived from the
same patient surgery. Symbol color, size, and shape within each box represent tumor grade, the number of tumor fragments, and adjunct therapy (radiation and/
or TMZ) received after surgery of primary and recurrent tumors.
(B) G-CIMP-low first recurrent tumors possess a higher overall stemness index in relation to their G-CIMP-high primary counterparts and G-CIMP-high first
recurrent tumors. The landscape of the stemness index in G-CIMP-low first recurrent tumors highly resembles those found in IDH-wild-type primary GBMs.

 11.70%) in G-CIMP-low-progressed cases (OR = 1.61, 95% CI:
1.28–2.03) (Figure 4C). From the list of 684 hypomethylated re-
gions, we then extracted those that mapped to the DNA motif
signature 50-TGA{G/C}TCA-30 (n = 87 DMRs). Among them,
87.36% were located in open seas, and 59.77% overlapped
with enhancers known to define tissue phenotypes (76 and 52
DMRs, respectively) (Figures 4A and 4D).
Our findings also suggested the motif signature 50-TTGT-30,
known to be associated with SOX family members of TFs, to be
significantly enriched: SOX3 (geometric test, q = 0, fold enrich-
ment = 1.49), SOX6 (geometric test, q = 0, fold enrichment =
1.47), SOX2 (geometric test, q = 1e�4, fold enrichment = 1.67),
SOX10 (geometric test, q = 7e�4, fold enrichment = 1.39), SOX4
(geometric test, q = 2.2e�3, fold enrichment = 1.55), and SOX15
(geometric test, q = 2.2e�3, fold enrichment = 1.47). We observed
that SOX TFs collectively may bind to 226 differentially hypome-
thylated regions, most of them located in intergenic open sea re-
gions (200 of 226, 88.50%) (Figures 4A–4D), thus recapitulating
epigenetic features of G-CIMP-low primary tumors (Figures
3B–3D; Ceccarelli et al., 2016). Additionally, a set of 5 differentially
DNA hypermethylated regions, mostly located in CGIs, showed
DNA binding sites for the SOX-related motif signature (Figures
4A–4D). Thirty-five of 684 hypomethylated DNA regions (5.12%)
shared both the 50-TGA{G/C}TCA-30 and 50-TTGT-30 motif signa-
tures (Figure 4D). Therefore, the above results suggest that DNA
demethylation events at CpGs deregulated in G-CIMP-low at first
recurrence would alter functional enhancers and DNA binding
sites recognizedby c-JUN/AP-1,contributingtoG-CIMPprogres-
sion toward a GBM-like phenotype (compilation of results shown
in Figure 4).

 Predictive Biomarker Signatures Can Predict the Risk
for G-CIMP-Low Progression at Primary Diagnosis
Our study demonstrates that G-CIMP-low tumor entities at first
recurrence resemble IDH-wild-type GBMs known to exhibit an
aggressive phenotype (Figures 2, 3, and 4). LGG relapse and
malignant progression to GBM are highly variable and unpredict-
able by the 2016 WHO classification of diffuse gliomas (Sanai
et al., 2011; Louis et al., 2016). To test whether G-CIMP-high to
G-CIMP-low malignant transformation can be predicted from
LGG G-CIMP-high primary diffuse gliomas, we performed a
supervised analysis between DNA methylation of G-CIMP-high
primary tumors progressing to the G-CIMP-low phenotype at first
recurrence and G-CIMP-high primary tumors that retain their
G-CIMP-high epigenetic profiling through glioma recurrence as
a form of epigenetic memory (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05,
absolute difference in mean methylation beta value > 0.2). We un-
covered a set of candidate predictive biomarker signatures
composed of 7 hypomethylated CpG sites in G-CIMP-high pri-
mary tumors that shifted their epigenomic profile and progressed
to GBMs upon disease relapse (Figure 5A).
Next we sought to determine the usefulness of our biomarkers
to predict gliomas at the time of initial surgical diagnosis at high
risk for recurrence with a G-CIMP-low malignant phenotype.
Toward this aim, we dichotomized the data using beta value

oma cases that relapse as progressed G-CIMP-low diseases
from primary glioma cases that relapse as normal-like or indolent
diseases. The beta value cutoff for each CpG probe was as fol-
lows: cg09732711 (0.7), cg09326832 (0.28), cg24665265 (0.67),
cg06220958 (0.17), cg10245915 (0.12), cg11689625 (0.31), and

tion value and FDR were assigned at n R 5 probes) (Figure 5B).
We then investigated and validated the predictive value of these
DNA methylation-based biomarkers in an independent cohort of
271 TCGA and non-TCGA primary gliomas previously classified
in Ceccarelli et al. (2016) as IDH mutant non-Codel G-CIMP-high
(n = 250) and IDH mutant non-Codel G-CIMP-low (n = 21). These
271 primary glioma samples were obtained from published data-
sets (Sturm et al., 2012; Turcan et al., 2012; Mur et al., 2013; Cec-
carelli et al., 2016). We found that the possible clinical biomarker
signatures identified here successfully predicted 29% of tumors
(79 of 271) belonging to the ‘‘risk group,’’ including 95% (20 of 21)
previously classified as G-CIMP-low primary tumors, with clin-
ical relevance for patient overall survival (log rank p = 0.02,

 hazard ratio [HR] = 2.19) (Figures 5C and 5D; Table S5). These
results provide insights into the tumorigenic events that
contribute to G-CIMP progression, with opportunity for further
targeted therapy exploitation as well as a inclusion in clinical tri-
als design to impede or prevent tumor malignant transformation
and progression to G-CIMP-low, an IDH-wild-type GBM-like tu-
mor phenotype associated with IDH mutant non-Codel gliomas.
DISCUSSION
The limited availability of clinical annotation and fresh tumor
specimens representing transitional stages from tumor initiation
to progression is an important barrier to effectively improving the
therapeutic strategies and clinical outcomes for GBM patients.
We describe the spatial and temporal epigenomic landscape
of brain cancer evolution through comprehensive analysis of
200 longitudinal tumor biopsies derived from 77 glioma patients.
To date, this represents the largest longitudinal adult diffuse
glioma cohort (grade II to IV) with DNA methylation profiles span-
ning more than 450,000 CpGs to understand the epigenome-
based evolution of gliomas.
IDH-wild-type and IDH mutant 1p-19q co-deleted glioma
cases did not change dramatically in terms of their epigenomic
profiles, but, among the IDH mutant non-Codel gliomas, we
defined distinct patterns of epigenetic shifts throughout the
course of tumor recurrence. Our large cohort of longitudinal
CIMP gliomas allowed us to discover an intra-subtype heteroge-
neity relative to G-CIMP-high primary tumors with specific
clinical outcomes further down the road of glioma evolution.
Specifically, we observed a large subset of IDH mutant LGG
G-CIMP-high tumor patients (37 of 53, 70%) that retained their
normal-like epimethyl phenotype as a form of epigenetic mem-
ory when relapsed, but only a rare proportion of IDH mutant
LGG G-CIMP-high tumor patients (9 of 53, 17%) underwent dis-
ease progression as G-CIMP-low epimethyl phenotype when
relapsed for the first time. Identification of a subpopulation of
G-CIMP-high tumors carrying the worst prognosis has crucial
clinical implications for the assessment and therapeutic man-
agement of individual aggressive LGGs at risk for malignant
recurrences and acquisition of an IDH-wild-type and stem
cell-like glioblastoma phenotype that could not be predicted
by histopathological grading at primary diagnosis. The discovery
that a set of classical G-CIMP-high tumors at diagnosis are
primed to recur toward a much more aggressive G-CIMP-low
tumor phenotype prompted us to identify possible clinical bio-
markers embedded in the primary tumors that could allow us
to predict malignant evolution of G-CIMP methylomes. Remark-
ably, we uncovered 7 predictive biomarkers that identify, with
high sensitivity and specificity, glioma patients at high risk for
recurrence with a G-CIMP-low tumor. This information will allow
neuro-oncologists to correctly predict, at the time of initial
diagnosis, the evolution of the disease, identifying at-risk pa-
tients who may need more aggressive therapies. Such markers
that define patient progression at primary diagnosis could poten-
tially allow one to design in vitro and patient-derived xenograft
models from these fresh tissues to study and evaluate the func-
tional characterization and mechanisms by which G-CIMP-low
evolves from G-CIMP-high. The finding also sheds light on the
evolutionary trajectory of initial LGGs, suggesting that GBMs
develop by different mechanistic epigenetic reprogramming
pathways in response to different selective influences or micro-
environmental injuries.
Our observation that de novo (primary) G-CIMP-low tumors
share
epigenome-wide
features
with
acquired
(recurrent)
G-CIMP-low tumors provides the lay basis to support the notion
that these tumors can be considered two separate tumor en-
tities. Therefore, the establishment of a G-CIMP-low methylome
in
malignant
recurrent
gliomas
reflects
the
response
of
transformed cells to the tumor microenvironment, which may
involve the interaction of epigenetic selective pressure (possibly
because of response to therapy) and immune, stromal, and
vascular cells. Given the large sample size for this study, which
allowed us to achieve statistical power, we sought to further
our understanding of this malignant transformation by investi-
gating the genomic DNA motif signature that is associated with
this progression phenotype. In-depth motif analysis led to the
identification of a STAT3 DNA signature at hypomethylated
shores and intergenic open sea genomic sites in G-CIMP-low
recurrent versus G-CIMP-low primary (fold enrichment = 4.36).
STAT3 is known to play a role as a master regulator of mesen-
chymal differentiation in glioma cells (Carro et al., 2010), and,
hence, this provides meaningful insights into the evolution of
G-CIMP-low recurrent cells along the aberrant mesenchymal
lineage
transformation
and
unfavorable
patient
outcomes
because these tumors can emerge as secondary GBMs. This hy-
pothesis is also supported by the higher mDNAsi in G-CIMP-low
recurrent versus the precursor G-CIMP-high counterparts. Addi-
tionally, G-CIMP-low recurrent tumors can be distinguished from
their parental G-CIMP-high counterparts by acquisition of DNA
demethylation abnormalities at intergenic enhancers associated
with the c-JUN/AP-1 binding motif, which were strongly reflec-
tive of (epi)genomic and stemness signatures of IDH-wild-type
primary GBMs. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that
c-JUN N-terminal phosphorylation regulates the DNMT1 gene
promoter, leading to DNA hypermethylation that is similar to
the G-CIMP phenotype in LGGs and proneural GBMs and corre-
lates with downregulation of mesenchyme-related genes and
reduced cell migration and invasiveness (Heiland et al., 2017).
Altogether, the aforementioned findings would imply that DNA
methylation loss associated with G-CIMP-low recurrence re-
flects chromatin remodeling events orchestrated by the interre-
lationship between the tumor microenvironment and the TFs
c-JUN/AP-1 and STAT3. In our study, we observed 100% of
G-CIMP-low at recurrence as grade IV tumors; however, not all
grade IV gliomas resembled G-CIMP-low, suggesting that grade
may not be the only determinant of G-CIMP-low cell identity in
this rare subset of aggressive IDH mutant 1p-19q non-Codel
gliomas.
Evidence is emerging that epigenetic abnormalities recapitu-
late somatic mutation events on cell cycle networks throughout
relapse and malignant progression of LGG G-CIMP glioma cells
to GBMs (Mazor et al., 2015). Interestingly, we are reporting the
existence of a small set of tumor specimens within the IDH mutant
LGG G-CIMP-high primary subtype exhibiting a G-CIMP-inter-
mediate epimethyl pattern when relapsed for the first time (7 of
53, 13%). G-CIMP-intermediate reflects epigenomic signatures
648

 of stemness comparable with G-CIMP-low recurrent. Our whole-
genome rearrangement results (Figures S4A–S4D) provide evi-
dence that intra-subtype heterogeneity relative to G-CIMP-high
primary tumors is associated with a higher frequency of loss of
the cell cycle genes CDKN2A and CDKN1B found in G-CIMP-in-
termediate recurrent tumors. Loss of the cell cycle inhibitor pro-
tein CDKN1B is a positive regulator of self-renewal and pluripo-
tency in human embryonic stem cells (Mencho
´ n et al., 2011).
Although IDH mutation initiates gliomagenesis and is retained
upon recurrence, a recent work suggested that neither mutant
IDH1 nor the oncometabolite 2HG are required for glioma recur-
rence. Moreover, recurrent glioma cells can delete or amplify the
IDH1 mutant or wild-type allele, which is followed by clonal
expansion and recurrence of tumors that resembled the
G-CIMP-low primary subtype. This raises the possibility that
IDH1 copy number alterations (CNAs) contribute to altering the
G-CIMP-low tumor methylome (Mazor et al., 2017). In conjunc-
tion, these findings provide evidence to mechanistically hypoth-
esize that G-CIMP-intermediate at recurrence recapitulates an
early stage of chromatin remodeling downstream of IDH1 CNAs
and genomic abnormalities on the tumor suppressor genes
CDKN2A and CDKN1B to evade cell cycle control at G1.
This would favor phenotype switching and confer tumor undiffer-
entiation (stem cell-like phenotype) and a selective subclonal
oncogenic growth advantage toward G-CIMP-low malignant
recurrent cells. This hypothesis has potential implications to
abrogate the establishment and progression of a malignant
glioma recurrent phenotype, suggesting possible synergistic
activity of an IDH mutant inhibitor (to target a phenotypic subpop-
ulation of G-CIMP tumor cells with a tumorigenic advantage)
combined with targeted therapy aimed at re-establishing the
tumor suppressor gene function at CDKN2A and CDKN1B
gene loci (to target a phenotypic subpopulation of G-CIMP tumor
cells with tumor-propagating and tumor relapse advantages).
Therefore, eradication of cells showing an early-stage transition
relative to G-CIMP progression may be an appealing strategy
that should be exploited to control malignant gliomas. The spatial
and temporal dynamics of G-CIMP epimethyl patterns identified
in our current study (G-CIMP-high to G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-
high to G-CIMP-low) allowed us to estimate the effect of somatic
mutations alongside the evolution of G-CIMP methylomes in the
exomes of initially LGG G-CIMP-high patients whose tumors
relapsed as G-CIMP-high (n = 8) or G-CIMP-low (n = 4). We
showed that G-CIMP-low recurrent tumors had the highest total
number of somatic mutations in relation to their G-CIMP-high
primary counterparts and G-CIMP-high at first recurrence (Fig-
ure S4E). This finding suggests that genomic instability acquired
by G-CIMP-low-progressed tumors accumulates downstream of
epigenetic reprogramming. Furthermore, this provides another
layer of evidence that genetic/epigenetic divergence exists in
the G-CIMP-high subtype at primary disease. Johnson et al.
(2014) reported that the 4 patients identified in our current study
as progressing to G-CIMP-low at recurrence (Figures 2 and S4E)
harbored a signature of temozolomide (TMZ)-induced mutagen-
esis in the RB and AKT-mTOR pathways, following an alternative
evolutionary path to GBM. Despite the fact that driver mutations
in these pathways and the hypermutator phenotype can emerge
at disease relapse after chemotherapy with TMZ (Johnson et al.,
2014), we identified convergent genetic alterations in G-CIMP-
low primary tumors (Ceccarelli et al., 2016; Figure S5). This rein-
forces the idea that distinct oncogenic selective pressures would
drive the evolution of G-CIMP-low primary tumors (cell-intrinsic
injury?) and G-CIMP-low recurrent tumors (epigenetic plasticity
as an adaptation to external cellular stimuli driven by therapy?).
Although recent reports have highlighted pronounced epige-
netic differences between LGG primary gliomas and GBM recur-
rent gliomas, these studies have grouped tumors by either grade
or genomic alterations. In our study, we took a more holistic
approach guided by our recent findings that the 2016 WHO clas-
sification of diffuse gliomas can be further divided by epigenomic
subtypes that are prognostically advantageous over both IDH
mutation status and histopathological grade. Collectively, our
data provide a conceptual framework to explore the molecular
drivers of genetic alterations and epigenetic plasticity contrib-
uting to G-CIMP malignant evolution toward an IDH-wild-type
and mesenchymal/stem cell-like glioblastoma phenotype, a
platform for identifying tumors and patients that best respond
to certain therapies, and predictive biomarkers for refining clin-
ical trial designs to determine optimal management of patients
at risk for malignant glioma recurrences.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Further details and an outline of the resources used in this work can be found in
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Patient and Sample Characteristics
Specimens were obtained from patients with appropriate consent from institu-
tional review boards. Details of sample preparation are described in the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures. Sample IDs and tissue source sites from
our entire longitudinal glioma cohort are listed in Table S1.
Data and Software Availability
Data visualization and statistical analysis were performed using R software
packages (https://www.r-project.org). The raw 450,000 DNA methylation
data reported in this paper has been deposited to Mendeley Data at https://
data.mendeley.com/datasets/hx566mwxnm/. All other raw data are available
through Genomics Data Commons (in the case of TCGA, the data are acces-
sible via TCGAbiolinks; Colaprico et al., 2016) or have been described in pre-
vious studies (Mazor et al., 2015; Bai et al., 2016; Mazor et al., 2017). For level 1
TCGA/GDC ‘‘Illumina HumanMethylation450’’ data acquisition (version 12
for LGG and version 6 for GBM), we used the Bioconductor package
TCGAbiolinks version 1.1.12 (Colaprico et al., 2016). In addition to TCGA
data, we obtained a published dataset of 81 (Mazor et al., 2015, 2017) and a
dataset of 48 (Bai et al., 2016) longitudinally collected gliomas (a complete
list of samples and their respective IDs are available in Table S1). Probe-level
signals for individual CpG sites (raw IDAT files) were subjected to background
correction, global dye bias normalization, calculation of the DNA methylation
level, and detection p values (Triche et al., 2013) using the Bioconductor pack-
age methylumi version 2.16.0. Longitudinal glioma samples were classified as
either IDH-wild-type (classic-like, mesenchymal-like, LGm6-GBM, and PA-
like) or IDH mutant (Codel, G-CIMP-high, and G-CIMP-low) DNA methylation
subtypes using the CpG methylation signatures previously defined by our
group
(Ceccarelli
et
al.,
2016;
tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/
lgggbm_2016/PanGlioma_MethylationSignatures.xlsx) and the R package
caret version 6.0-76 and randomForest version 4.6-12. RF probability indices
are provided in Table S1. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test followed by
multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) method for FDR esti-
mation (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) to identify differentially methylated
sites between two groups of study. De novo and known motif discovery ana-
lyses were conducted using Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif Enrichment
