AbsTRACT
Objective To determine whether antioxidant 
supplements and antioxidant-enriched foods can prevent 
or reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness after exercise.
Methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and 
Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, 
SPORTDiscus, trial registers, reference lists of articles and 
conference proceedings up to February 2017.
Results In total, 50 studies were included in this review 
which included a total of 1089 participants (961 were 
male and 128 were female) with an age range of 16–55 
years. All studies used an antioxidant dosage higher 
than the recommended daily amount. The majority of 
trials (47) had design features that carried a high risk 
of bias due to selective reporting and poorly described 
allocation concealment, potentially limiting the reliability 
of their findings. We rescaled to a 0–10 cm scale in order 
to quantify the actual difference between groups and 
we found that the 95% CIs for all five follow-up times 
were all well below the minimal important difference 
of 1.4 cm: up to 6 hours (MD −0.52, 95% CI −0.95 
to −0.08); at 24 hours (MD −0.17, 95% CI −0.42 to 
0.07); at 48 hours (mean difference (MD) −0.41, 95% CI 
−0.69 to −0.12); at 72 hours (MD −0.29, 95% CI −0.59 
to 0.02); and at 96 hours (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.43 
to 0.37). Thus, the effect sizes suggesting less muscle 
soreness with antioxidant supplementation were very 
unlikely to equate to meaningful or important differences 
in practice.
Conclusions There is moderate to low-quality evidence 
that high-dose antioxidant supplementation does 
not result in a clinically relevant reduction of muscle 
soreness after exercise of up to 6 hours or at 24, 48, 
72 and 96 hours after exercise. There is no evidence 
available on subjective recovery and only limited 
evidence on the adverse effects of taking antioxidant 
supplements.
InTROduCTIOn
Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) typically 
occurs after strenuous and unaccustomed exercise 
and physical activity. It is classified as a grade 1 
muscle strain injury and is characterised by local-
ised tenderness and soreness.1 Depending on the 
severity of exercise, DOMS typically peaks between 
24 and 72 
hours after a bout of exercise but even-
tually disappears after 5–7 
days.2–7 DOMS could 
be detrimental for athletes who are returning to 
training from a prolonged period of inactivity. In 
addition, DOMS could deter individuals from 
adhering to an exercise programme. For some indi-
viduals, DOMS could result from excessive physical 
activity associated with daily living, particularly if 
repeated eccentric movements or unaccustomed 
physical activity is involved.
Several theories have been proposed to explain 
the mechanisms underlying DOMS. These include 
lactate 
accumulation,8 
inflammation,9 
muscle 
spasm,10 muscle damage,11 connective tissue 
damage12 and increased muscle temperature.13 A 
common feature of several of these proposed mech-
anisms is an increased production of free radicals,14 
and reactive oxygen species. Indeed, it has been 
shown that reactive oxygen species are produced 
in nearly every biological process and that they 
also play a crucial role as signalling molecules 
for translating the exercise signals to appropriate 
adaptations.15
The rationale for taking antioxidant supplements 
after exercise to reduce DOMS comes from the 
notion that they could reduce the negative effects 
of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress 
resulting from exercise.16 Oxidative stress could 
deplete the body's antioxidant defences and increase 
the rate of free radical production.17–19 Moreover, 
unaccustomed, eccentric and exhaustive exercise 
may also induce inflammatory reactions which can 
contribute to increased reactive oxygen species 
production and reduced antioxidant defences.20 
These can cause exercise-induced muscle damage 
and result in DOMS.1 Dietary antioxidants may 
counteract oxidative stress by reducing the produc-
tion of free radical and reactive oxygen species 
associated with exercise.17 Reducing DOMS could 
be beneficial to athletes when returning to training 
from injury (ie, after a period of inactivity), and it 
could help sedentary and older individuals recover 
from unaccustomed physical activity.
The ease of taking antioxidant supplements to 
prevent and reduce muscle soreness after exer-
cise and enhance recovery makes it an attractive 
option for physically active individuals. Moreover, 
antioxidant supplements are available to buy from 
supermarkets and health food stores and some are 
marketed to enhance recovery. Despite the popu-
larity of antioxidant supplements, the evidence 
supporting its use is mixed.21–23 Therefore, the 
objective of this systematic review was to deter-
mine whether antioxidant supplements and anti-
oxidant-enriched foods could prevent or reduce 
DOMS after exercise.
MeThOds
Inclusion criteria

domised controlled trials investigating the effects 
of dietary antioxidants on preventing or reducing 
DOMS were considered for this meta-analysis.

Review
search strategy
A systematic search of the literature was conducted in the 
Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised 
Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and SPORTDiscus, current 
to February 2017 was performed by two authors.  
ClinicalTrials. 
gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also 
searched for any ongoing or recently completed studies. Experts 
in the field were also contacted to find unpublished trials. 
The reference list of all included studies and relevant reviews 
were also screened for further references to relevant trials. No 
language restrictions were applied.
data extraction
T
wo authors independently extracted data using a customised 
form. We resolved any disagreements by consultation with the 
other authors. In some cases, the primary authors of selected 
studies were contacted for additional information and data.
heterogeneity and risk of bias
For all included studies, methodological quality was assessed by 
two authors independently using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.24 
We resolved any disagreement by discussion and, if necessary, 
consultation with the other authors. Heterogeneity was assessed 
using the Χ² test and I² statistic, with the level of significance 
for the Χ² test being set at p=0.10.25 
We interpreted values of 
I² as follows: might not be important (0%–40%); may represent 
moderate heterogeneity (30%–60%); may represent substan-
tial heterogeneity (50%–90%); and may represent considerable 
heterogeneity (75%–100%).
Meta-analyses
Mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs were calculated for contin-
uous data using RevMan (Review Manager; RevMan). When 
studies used different ways of measuring a continuous outcome 
standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% CIs were calcu-
lated. Due to substantial clinical and statistically significant 
heterogeneity a random effects model, again with 95% CIs, was 
employed.
subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses were performed in RevMan. Subgroup anal-
yses included the timing of antioxidant administration (pre-ex-
ercise vs postexercise), type of exercise (mechanically induced 
damage vs whole body aerobic exercise) and funding source 
(trials funded by food company or provider of antioxidant 
supplements vs those not funded by food company or provider 
of antioxidant supplements).
ResulTs
study characteristics
We completed the search in February 2017 and 1558 records 
from the following databases were screened: Cochrane Bone, 
Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (25 
records), CENTRAL (194), MEDLINE (302), Embase (476), 
SPORTDiscus (117),  
ClinicalTrials. 
gov (162) and the WHO 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (282). We also 
identified 12 potentially eligible studies from ongoing searches 
and through contacting experts in the field. The search resulted 
in the identification of 128 potentially eligible studies, for which 
we obtained full reports. On study selection, we included 50 and 
excluded 77.
The 50 trials included in this systematic review had a total of 
1089 participants, with 901 participants in the parallel group 
trials (range 7–54) and 188 participants in the crossover trials 
(range 8–24). All 50 studies were randomised controlled trials; 
no quasirandomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. 
Thirty-eight trials (with a total of 901 participants) employed a 
parallel design.21 22 26–59 The other 12 trials (with a total of 188 
participants) employed a crossover design.60–71
Seven trials were designed to produce DOMS under field-based 
conditions,22 34 43–45 63 and the other 43 studies were designed 
to produce DOMS under laboratory-based conditions. In all 
trials, an antioxidant supplement was compared with a placebo. 
Thirteen trials used antioxidants from a whole natural food 
source,22 28 29 40 43 45 50 61 63 64 67 70 71 19 used an antioxidant extract 
or mixed antioxidants26 31 34 36 37 39 41 42 44 47 48 51 52 54 60 65 66 68 and 
18 provided either vitamin C or vitamin E or both together.21 27 
30 32 33 35 38 46 49 53 55 57–59 62 69 72 73 All studies used a placebo either 
as a powder, capsule or drink; however, three studies did not 
provide details of what the placebo comprised.46 49 60 No trials 
compared high-dose versus low-dose antioxidant supplements, 
where the low-dose supplementation is within normal or recom-
mended levels for the antioxidant involved.
There was a large variation across the studies regarding the 
duration of supplementation: the shortest period was under 
1 
day68 69 and the longest period was 91 days.39 Although the 
form of supplement was varied, including capsules, powders and 
drinks, every study used an antioxidant dosage higher than the 
recommended daily amount. Every study required the partici-
pant to ingest the supplement orally either once daily or up 
to three times per day. Supplementation was taken before, the 
day of and after exercise for up to several days in all the studies 
except for three studies where supplements were postexercise 
only.65 67 73
Funding
In all, 21 studies were industry funded either by a 
food company or a provider of antioxidant supple-
ments.26–29 31 32 39 41 43 47 50 52 58 60 61 67–71 73 Of the 28 other 
studies reporting on funding, 15 declared ‘none’ in their 
report21 30 33–36 40 44 46 49 53 57 59 62; the other 13 referring to 
various sources of university and public body research funding 
sources.22 37 38 42 45 48 51 54 55 63–66 We were unsuccessful in 
obtaining information on funding from the only trial that did 
not report on this.56
Risk of bias
Forty-seven trials (94%) had design features that were deemed to 
carry a high risk of bias due to random sequence generation (19 
trials),21 22 27 35 37 41–43 46 49 52 56 57 60 61 65 66 70 71 selective reporting (41

Primary outcomes
All of the 50 trials included in this review measured muscle 
soreness; however, there were differences in the types of sore-
ness scales used. Thirty-three trials measured muscle soreness 
using a 0–10 
cm (or 0–100 
mm) visual analogue scale (VAS). 
Of the 17 other trials, seven21 26 37 62 65 69 73 measured soreness 
using a 1–10 
cm scale; four trials29 45 74 75 used the 0–20

Review
Herrlinger et al39 used a 0–7 Likert scale, Drobnic et al36 used a 
0–4 point scale; Cobley et al34 used a 0–12 
cm scale and Su et al56 
used the Borg CR-10 scale. The Borg CR-10 scale ranges from 0 
(no soreness) to 10 (maximal soreness). In the included studies, 
participants were asked to rate muscle soreness on the soreness 
scales by either carrying out a squat using body weight, self-pal-
pitation of muscle or based on muscle soreness at rest.
Forty-eight studies presented data on muscle soreness at 
various different time points based on various VAS scores. 
Results are presented at eight follow-up times after exercise: up 
to 6 
hours, and at 24, 48, 73, 96, 120, 144 and 168 
hours.
Antioxidant supplementation reduced muscle soreness in 
comparison to the placebo condition when measured up to 
6 
hours after exercise (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −0.56 to −0.04; 
participants=525; studies=21; I2=53%; low-quality evidence); 
at 24 
hours after exercise (SMD −0.13, 95% 
CI −0.27 to 0.00; 
participants=936; 
studies=41; 
I2=5%; 
moderate-quality 
evidence); at 48 
hours after exercise (SMD −0.24, 95% 
CI −0.42 
to −0.07; participants=1047; studies=45; I2=47%; low-quality 
evidence); and at 72 
hours after exercise (SMD −0.19, 95% 
CI 
−0.38 to −0.00; participants=657; studies=28; I2=27%; 
moderate-quality evidence). There was little effect of antioxi-
dants on muscle soreness at 96 
hours after exercise (SMD −0.05, 
95% 
CI −0.29 to 0.19; participants=436; studies=17; I2=31%; 
low-quality evidence). Far fewer trials provided data at 5 
days or 
subsequently. There was very low-quality evidence of little effect 
of antioxidants on muscle soreness at 120 
hours (SMD 0.21, 
95% 
CI −0.26 to 0.69; participants=128; studies=4; I2=39%), 
at 144 
hours (SMD −0.23, 95% 
CI −1.11 to 0.65; partici-
pants=20; studies=1) or at 168 
hours (SMD −0.04, 95% 
CI 
−0.48 to 0.41; participants=80; studies=4; I2=0%).
As there was considerable variation in the units used to 
measure muscle soreness, we rescaled all trials to the 0–10 scale 
at the first five time points in order to explore the actual differ-
ence between groups on a standard scale. The results are as 
follows: up to 6 
hours (MD −0.52, 95% 
CI −0.95 to −0.08; 
participants=525; studies=21; I2=66%); at 24 
hours (MD 
−0.17, 95% 
CI −0.42 to 0.07; participants=936; studies=41; 
I2=29%); at 48 
hours (MD −0.41, 95% 
CI −0.69 to −0.12; 
participants=1047; studies=45; I2=64%); at 72 
hours (MD 
−0.29, 95% 
CI −0.59 to 0.02; participants=657; studies=28; 
I2=27%); and at 96 
hours (MD −0.03, 95% 
CI −0.43 to 0.37; 
participants=436; studies=17; I2=51%). This rescaling also 
allows us to examine whether the antioxidant supplement 
produces a clinically important difference. For consistency with 
Bleakley et al,4 we considered 1.4 
cm as the minimal important 
difference (MID) for pain reduction on a 10 
cm VAS; this was 
based on an estimated MID for musculoskeletal conditions of 
the shoulder by Tashjian et al.76 It is notable that all of the upper 
limits of the 95% CIs of these five analyses are lower than this 
MID and hence all quantitative differences do not appear to 
represent person-relevant differences in muscle soreness.
subgroup and sensitivity analyses
We performed only a few subgroup and sensitivity analyses. 
We selected the 24 and 48 
hours analyses for subgroup analyses 
given that these were the categories with the largest number of 
trials. We did not use the up to 6 
hours time period because of 
the variation in the timing of measurement: that is, some studies 
measured this outcome immediately after exercise whereas other 
studies measured this up to 2 
hours or up to 6 
hours after exer-
cise. A sensitivity analysis exploring the use of the fixed effect 
model for all eight follow-up times produced similar results to 
that of random effects model. A subgroup analysis could not 
be performed on timing of administration (ie, pre-exercise and 
postexercise vs postexercise only) because there were very few 
trials (one or two studies depending on the time of follow-up) 
in the postexercise group. We performed a subgroup analysis on 
the type of exercise, that is, mechanically induced versus whole 
body aerobic exercise for the 24 and 48 
hours follow-up times. 
There is no evidence of subgroup differences for muscle sore-
ness for type of exercise at 24 
hours (Χ²=0.44, df=1; p=0.51, 
I²=0%) or at 48 
hours (Χ²=0.88, df=1; p=0.35, I²=0%). Our 
second subgroup analysis was based on source of funding where 
we compared studies that were funded by a food company or 
provider of antioxidant supplements versus studies that there 
were not. There is no evidence of subgroup differences for 
muscle soreness according to source of funding at 24 
hours 
(Χ²=0.03, df=1, p=0.87, I²=0%) or 48 
hours (Χ²=0.10, df=1, 
p=0.875 I²=0%); no information on funding was available for 
Su et al.56
We conducted a sensitivity analysis testing trials at 
unclear risk of bias, relating to random sequence genera-
tion, allocation concealment or both, which included 19 
trials.22 26 28–34 38 39 44 48 50 54 55 63 67 68 This analysis made little 
difference to the overall effect at either 24 
hours before exer-
cise (SMD −0.10, 95% 
CI −0.37 to 0.17; participants=280; 
studies=14; I2=19%) or at 48 
hours (SMD −0.31, 95% 
CI 
−0.66 to 0.04; participants=327; studies=16; I2=57%).
subjective recovery
No study measured subjective recovery (return to previous activ-
ities without signs or symptoms).
Adverse effects
Nine studies34 41 43–45 50 52 64 65 reporting on a total of 216 partic-
ipants reported on this outcome (very low-quality evidence). 
One study reported that all six participants in the N-acetylcys-
teine (NAC) supplementation group had diarrhoea, which was 
mild in five participants and severe in one.34 The same study 
reported mild indigestion in four participants (67%) in the NAC 
group and one of six participants in the placebo group. Another 
study43 reported that tart cherry juice caused mild gastrointes-
tinal distress in one of 26 participants taking the antioxidant 
supplement. Seven studies reported no adverse effects of taking 
the antioxidant supplementation.41 44 45 50 52 64 65 The remaining 
41 studies failed to report adverse effects.
dIsCussIOn
This review examined the effectiveness of antioxidants for 
preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise. Fifty 
randomised placebo controlled studies were included, 12 of 
which used a crossover design. The 50 studies involved a total 
of 1089 participants (961 male; 128 female; age range 16–55 
years). The studies were heterogeneous, including the timing 
(pre-exercise or postexercise), frequency, dose or duration, 
type of antioxidant supplementation and the type of preceding 
DOMS-producing exercise. All studies used an antioxidant 
dosage higher than the recommended daily amount. No studies 
compared high dose versus low dose, where the low-dose 
supplementation was within normal or recommended levels for 
the antioxidant involved.
Pooled SMD results for muscle soreness indicated a small 
difference in favour of antioxidant supplementation after 
DOMS-inducing exercise at all main follow-ups (up to 6 
hours: 
low-quality evidence, at 24 
hours: moderate-quality evidence, at

Review
48 
hours: low-quality evidence, at 72 
hours: moderate-quality 
evidence, at 96 
hours: low-quality evidence. When, however, 
we rescaled all the trial results to the 0–10 
cm scale in order to 
compare the actual difference between groups, we found that 
the 95% CIs for all five follow-up times were all below 1.0 
cm, 
and thus all below the MID of 1.4 
cm that we used in this review. 
Thus, all statistical differences in DOMS favouring antioxi-
dant supplementation were unlikely to equate to meaningful or 
important differences in practice.
Neither of our subgroup analyses to examine for differences in 
effect according to type of DOMS-inducing exercise (mechanical 
vs whole body aerobic) or according to funding source confirmed 
subgroup differences. Sensitivity analyses to test the selection of 
the statistical model for pooling (fixed effect instead of random 
effects) and the exclusion of crossover studies all showed similar 
results to the main analyses. None of the 50 studies reported on 
subjective recovery (return to previous activities without signs 
or symptoms). Only nine studies (216 participants) reported on 
adverse effects, with actual events reported in two studies. One 
study34 (12 participants) reported that all six participants in the 
NAC supplementation group had diarrhoea, which was mild in 
five participants and severe in one. The same study34 reported 
mild indigestion in four participants (67%) in the NAC group 
and one of six participants in the placebo group. It should be 
noted that NAC supplementation is usually prescribed and it has 
been found to cause uncomfortable side effects including nausea 
and diarrhoea in other studies. Another study43 reported that 
tart cherry juice caused mild gastrointestinal distress in one of 
26 participants taking the antioxidant supplement. The other 
seven studies reported no adverse effects of taking the antioxi-
dant supplementation; this included 10 participants having NAC 
supplementation in one study. Overall, the available evidence for 
adverse events is very low quality.
The majority of the 1089 participants included in this review 
were male (961; 88.2%) and so arguably the findings of the 
review are mainly applicable to men, but there is no biological 
basis for why antioxidants should have a different effect in the 
two sexes. These sex differences are typical of what is observed 
in the athletic recovery literature.3 4 7 More noteworthy is that 
no data from highly trained elite athletes were included in the 
analyses; the data pertaining to nine elite athletes tested in 
McCormick et al’s63 study were not included in the meta-anal-
yses because the exercise paradigm was completely different 
from all the other studies included in this review. As the majority 
of the participants were either college students or relatively 
young and active, these findings cannot be generalised in the 
elite athlete population who have a different physiological and 
training status. Some reservations in terms of applicability also 
apply to older individuals due to their anatomical and physiolog-
ical characteristics as there were no older participants included 
in this review (age range of participants: 16–55 years).
We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations 
framework, which combines considerations of risk of bias, indi-
rectness, inconsistency (heterogeneity), imprecision and publica-
tion bias. We downgraded all outcomes to one level for serious 
risk of bias, due mainly to selective reporting bias (the majority 
of the trials failed to report on adverse effects) and, to a lesser 
degree, attrition biases. We did not downgrade for indirectness 
in relation to muscle soreness. We downgraded two outcomes for 
serious inconsistency reflecting heterogeneity that could not be 
traced to the inclusion of just one outlier trial. Pooled evidence 
did not support downgrading for imprecision. Our tests for 
publication bias did not reveal a serious concern, although all 
were small studies. Thus, we did not downgrade for publication 
bias. We concluded that the quality of the evidence ranged from 
moderate to very low.
It is important to acknowledge some important limitations of 
this 
review.

were extracted from graphs using GraphClick 2010 Arizona 
(V
.3.0.2; 2010) because the authors did not respond to several 
emails that requested mean and SD data. While this is not ideal, 
we tried to minimise error by having two review authors (MKR 
and DR) independently extract the data, with any discrepan-
cies resolved by consultation with the third and fourth authors 
(HS and JTC). Second, our inclusion of crossover studies and 
our analysis of their data as if from a parallel group trial, thus 
without adjustment for the crossover design, are other poten-
tial sources of bias. With one exception, the crossover studies 
included in this review used a washout period of 2–6 weeks, 
which is sufficient to allow the muscles to recover. The excep-
tion60 used a washout period of only 5 days between treat-
ments and therefore carries some risk of a carry-over effect; 
sensitivity analysis to check on the effect of excluding the data 
from this trial did not result in important changes. Further 
sensitivity analyses checking the effects of excluding the cross-
over trials from the muscle soreness analyses showed that our 
inclusion and handling of the crossover studies did not have an 
important impact on the review results.
COnClusIOns
There is moderate to low-quality evidence that antioxidant 
supplementation does not result in a clinically relevant reduc-
tion of DOMS after exercise at any of the five follow-up times 
assessed (up to 6 
hours and at 24, 48, 72 and 96 
hours after exer-
cise). There is no evidence available on subjective recovery and 
only limited evidence on adverse effects of taking antioxidant 
supplements. Some antioxidant supplements such as NAC may 
cause unwanted side effects including gastrointestinal discom-
fort and diarrhoea. Thus, taking antioxidant supplements and 
antioxidant-enriched foods is not an effective strategy to reduce 
DOMS after exercise.
What is already known?
 
► Taking antioxidant supplements to reduce muscle soreness is 
a common strategy used by recreational and elite athletes.
 
► However, little is known about how effective antioxidants are 
at reducing delayed-onset muscle soreness.
What are the new findings?
 
► There is moderate to low-quality evidence that high-dose 
antioxidant supplementation does not result in a clinically 
relevant reduction of muscle soreness after exercise of up to 
6 hours or at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after exercise.
 
► There is no evidence available on subjective recovery and only 
limited evidence on the adverse effects of taking antioxidant 
supplements.
 
► The findings of, and messages from, this review provide an 
opportunity for researchers and other stakeholders to come 
together and consider what the priorities are, and underlying 
justifications, for future research in this area.
