The Use of Cannabis for Headache Disorders
Bryson C. Lochte, Alexander Beletsky, Nebiyou K. Samuel, and Igor Grant*
Abstract
Headache disorders are common, debilitating, and, in many cases, inadequately managed by existing treatments.
Although clinical trials of cannabis for neuropathic pain have shown promising results, there has been limited
research on its use, specifically for headache disorders. This review considers historical prescription practices,
summarizes the existing reports on the use of cannabis for headache, and examines the preclinical literature ex-
ploring the role of exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids to alter headache pathophysiology. Currently,
there is not enough evidence from well-designed clinical trials to support the use of cannabis for headache,
but there are sufficient anecdotal and preliminary results, as well as plausible neurobiological mechanisms, to
warrant properly designed clinical trials. Such trials are needed to determine short- and long-term efficacy for
specific headache types, compatibility with existing treatments, optimal administration practices, as well as po-
tential risks.

Introduction
Headache is a major public health concern, with enor-
mous individual and societal costs (estimated at $14.4
billion annually) due to decreased quality of life and
disability.1 Each year, *47% of the population experi-
ence headache, including migraine (10%), tension-type
headache (38%), and chronic daily headache (3%).2 A
sexual dimorphism exists for headache disorders,
with women 2–3 times more likely to experience mi-
graine3 and 1.25 times more likely to experience
tension-type headache than men.4
The present review will focus largely on migraine,
tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalal-
gias (specifically cluster headache), and medication-
overuse headache (MOH). Migraine is classified as a
4–72 h headache that is typically unilateral, pulsating,
of moderate-to-severe intensity, and associated with
photophobia and phonophobia.5,6 Tension-type head-
ache is classified as frequent, infrequent, or chronic,
typically presenting with bilateral tightening pain of
mild-to-moderate intensity and lasting minutes to
days.6,7 Cluster headache is defined as severe unilateral
pain in orbital, temporal, and/or supraorbital locations,
lasting 15–180 min and typically occurring frequently
and at regular intervals.6,8 MOH is a chronic condition
(occurs more than 15 days per month) that develops
from frequent use of anti-headache medications.6,9
The pathophysiology of headache disorders is still
under investigation. However, it is believed that mi-
graine and cluster headaches are initiated in the brain
in areas such as the hypothalamus, brainstem, or pos-
sibly cortex.6 Tension-type headaches can not only
originate in the central nervous system but may also
be triggered by myofascial tissue, often developing in
response to stress.10 Regardless of origin, headaches
usually involve overactivation of the trigeminovascular
pathway, resulting in the release of vasoactive peptides,
such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and sub-
stance P, as well as vasoactive mediators such as nitrous
oxide (NO), which can lead to further sensitization of

 nociceptive receptors in the head and neck.11 Serotoni-
nergic signaling, parasympathetic efferents, inflamma-
tion, and increased intracranial pressure also play
important roles in headache disorders.12,13
Treatment depends on the underlying headache
condition; however, some popular options include
NSAIDs
for
mild
headaches
and
triptans,
anti-
depressants, verapamil, or ergotamine for more severe
or chronic headaches.14 These may be complemented
by nonpharmacological interventions such as cognitive-
behavioral therapy or relaxation training.15 Despite
many treatment options, less than half of headache
sufferers experience remission, and many continue to
develop more severe or chronic headaches throughout
their lifetime.16 Moreover, headache disorders are
often underrecognized and undertreated.17 This current
situation warrants an exploration of additional treat-
ment options for headache disorders, with favorable
side-effect profiles and efficacy in refractory patients.
One such option, cannabis, has been ignored in the
United States for the past several decades but has an
established history in the treatment of headaches. As-
syrian manuscripts from the second millennium BCE
recommended cannabis to ‘‘bind the temples,’’18 and
Ayurvedic preparations in the third and fourth centu-
ries BCE were indicated for ‘‘diseases of the head’’
such as migraines.19 The prescription of cannabis was
even recommended in ancient Greece, with Pedanius
Dioscorides describing its use in his De Maternia
Medica as a treatment for ‘‘pain of the ears.’’20 Other ci-
tations documenting the use of cannabis for headache
disorders arise from the ninth century in the Al-Aq-
rabadhin Al-Saghir, the earliest known document of
Arabic pharmacology.19 Further recommendations
are found in Persian texts from the 10th21 and 17th
centuries.22 Prominent physicians of the Middle
Ages, including John Parkinson23 and Nicholas
Culpeper,24 also recommended the use of cannabis
for headache.
The reintroduction of cannabis to the West in 183925
began a century of its use as an effective treatment for
headache disorders26 until its illegalization in 1937.27
Notable physicians who espoused the benefits of can-
nabis for headache disorders included John Russell
Reynolds, the personal physician of Queen Victoria,28
American neurologist Silas Weir Mitchell,29 the presi-
dent of the New York Neurological Society Edouard
C. Seguin,19 William Gowers, a founding father of
modern neurology,30 and Sir William Osler, often con-
sidered the father of modern medicine.31
When cannabis was deemed illegal by the U.S. gov-
ernment, its therapeutic use and research into its med-
ical potential was largely discontinued. To this day,
there are few clinical investigations of the use of canna-
bis for headache; however, the studies that have
emerged demonstrate potential efficacy. In addition,
numerous pre-clinical investigations18 have validated
the role of endocannabinoids in preventing headache
pathophysiology, which suggests a mechanistic role of
cannabis in the treatment of these disorders. Although
the cannabis plant comprises more than 100 cannabi-
noids, there has been little study of the individual ef-
fects of these cannabinoids on headache disorders;
therefore, the present review will focus largely on the
clinical potential of the cannabis plant as a whole.
The present review has four unique aims: (1) High-
light common historical trends in the use of cannabis in
the treatment of headache to inform future clinical
guidelines. (2) Briefly present the current clinical liter-
ature on this topic, with a focus on more recent publi-
cations that have not been discussed in past reviews. (3)
Compile various preclinical studies into a prospective
integrated model outlining the role of cannabinoids
in the modulation of headache pathogenesis. (4) Out-
line several19,32–35 future directions that warrant explo-
ration based on the limited, but promising findings on
this topic.
Materials and Methods
The material presented was drawn from standard
searches of the PubMed/National Library of Medicine
database, influential sources of current medical litera-
ture, and past review articles. Search keywords in-
cluded cannabis; cannabinoids; headache; migraine;
cluster headache; medication-overuse headache; tetra-
hydrocannabinol; cannabidiol; clinical trial; placebo;
and double blind. CliniacalTrials.gov was also queried
for studies that have not yet been published. Individual
articles were selected based on historical, clinical, or
preclinical relevance to cannabinoids or cannabis as a
treatment for headaches.
Historical Use of Cannabis for Headache
Historical reports, though not ideal forms of evidence,
are important resources for understanding the poten-
tial use of cannabis in the treatment of headache disor-
ders. Clinical publications between 1839 and 1937
provide valuable insights into the most effective
practices, challenges, and benefits during an era
when cannabis was commonly used to treat headache.

 A summary of historical treatment practices using can-
nabis for migraines can be seen in Table 1. Historical
sources indicate that cannabis was used as an effective
prophylactic and abortive treatment for headache dis-
orders. Although dosing varied among physicians,
most prescribed alcohol extractions of the drug in the
range of ¼ to ½ grain (16–32 mg).28,32,36–40 This dose
was likely chosen to minimize the effects of intoxica-
tion while also providing effective therapeutic relief.
Other providers suggested that doses should be pro-
gressively increased until modest effects of intoxication
were felt.19 For prophylactic treatment, these doses
were usually administered two to three times daily
for weeks or even months.28,32,36–38 Acute treatment
often involved higher doses taken as needed and, in
some cases, smoked cannabis was recommended.19,41–42
Early reports of cannabis for the treatment of
headache appear to be largely positive, with many pa-
tients experiencing a decrease in the frequency and
intensity of their headache episodes. In some cases,
headache was cured entirely even after cannabis dis-
continuation.28,32,36–42 Furthermore, these early clini-
cal reports praise the apparent safety of long-term
cannabis use, as well as its added benefits of mollify-
ing the nausea and anxiety that often accompany
headaches. A common emphasis was placed on the
importance of specific purity, preservation, and ad-
ministration of the cannabis as well as patient adher-
ence in the efficacy of treatment.
Clinical Studies on Cannabis Use for Headache
The schedule 1 classification of marijuana in 1970 has
made rigorous clinical studies on the treatment efficacy
of this substance difficult. Currently, there are no
placebo-controlled clinical studies examining the use
of cannabis for headache; nevertheless, there have
been a number of other studies published that give in-
sight into its therapeutic efficacy (Table 2).19,43–58
However, care should be taken when interpreting the
findings from these studies. With one exception,53
these studies did not include a control group, and
given that the placebo effect can be altered by the con-
text of treatment,59 it is reasonable to expect a signifi-
cant placebo response given the pre-existing public
popularity and notoriety of cannabis. Moreover, self-
reports and case studies may have a bias toward im-
mediate improvement without awareness of possible
dependence, rebound, or withdrawal responses, which
are important concerns in headache treatment.60 In
fact, studies show that headache can be induced in
23.2% patients undergoing cannabis withdrawal.61
Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid mimicking tetra-
hydrocannabinol (THC), has been shown to decrease
analgesic intake while reducing MOH pain in a

 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.53 In this study,
26 patients with treatment refractory MOH com-
pleted a course of either nabilone (0.5 mg) or ibupro-
fen (400 mg) for 8 weeks, then after a week-long
washout period, completed a second 8-week course
of the previously excluded medication. Oral cannabi-
noid administration was chosen over an oromusocal
THC spray, both because oral administration avoids
the concentration peaks that can lead to euphoric
effects and because chronic administration better
overcomes individual differences in bioavailability.
Although both substances showed improvement from
baseline, nabilone was significantly more effective than
ibuprofen in reducing pain intensity, analgesic intake,
and medication dependence, as well as in improving
quality of life. This study also examined the safety of
nabilone as a treatment for headache and found that
patients only experienced mild adverse effects that dis-
appeared after discontinuation of the medication. The
results of this study are significant, especially given
that MOH is exacerbated by many pharmacological
treatments. This study also highlights the potential
value of cannabis in combination therapies, as a supple-
ment to traditional treatments, or as a secondary treat-
ment in refractory cases. Currently, a multicenter,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study is being per-
formed to examine the safety and efficacy of a dronabi-
nol, or synthetic THC, metered dose inhaler for the
treatment of migraine (clincaltrials.gov, NCT Identifier:
NCT00123201). When published, this study could give
valuable insights into the efficacy and risks of cannabi-
noids for the treatment of migraines.
Cannabis and cannabinoids have been studied clin-
ically for other conditions, showing efficacy in the
treatment of neuropathic/chronic pain, spasticity, and
nausea.62–66 These three conditions are associated
mechanistically and qualitatively with the experience
of headache and, although the clinical literature for
each of these conditions exceeds the scope of this re-
view, it is plausible that their efficacy will carry over

 in the treatment of headache disorders as well. For ex-
ample, the analgesic properties of cannabis seen in the
treatment of neuropathic pain will likely apply to
chronic headache, the antispasmodic properties seen
in the treatment of multiple sclerosis could apply to
muscle strain known to induce tension headaches,
and the antiemetic properties seen in the treatment of
chemotherapy-associated nausea might also palliate
migraine-induced nausea.
Many individuals are currently using cannabis for
the treatment of migraine and headache with posi-
tive results. In a survey of nine California clinics
(N = 1746), physicians recorded headaches and mi-
graines as a reason for approving a medical marijuana
ID card in 2.7% of cases, and 40.7% patients self-
reported that cannabis had therapeutic benefits for
headaches and migraines. In another California survey
of 7525 patients, 8.43% of patients reported that they
were using medical cannabis to treat migraines.
Another survey of 1430 patients found that 9% of pa-
tients were using medical cannabis to treat migraines
(subdivided into 7.5% for classical migraines, 1% for
cluster headaches, and 0.5% for others). Other studies
have reported the use of cannabis for migraine or head-
ache relief, with specific estimates including 5%
(N = 24,800) and 6.6% (N = 128) for migraines and
3.6% (N = 128) and 7.4% (N = 217) for headache.
Other studies have looked specifically at the change
in the occurrence of headache disorders with use of
cannabis.52 One retrospective study described 121 pa-
tients who received cannabis for migraine treatment,
among whom 85.1% of these patients reported a reduc-
tion in migraine frequency.47 The mean number of mi-
graines at the initial visit was 10.4, falling to 4.6 at
follow-up visits after cannabis treatment. Moreover,
11.6% of the patients found that, when smoked, canna-
bis could effectively arrest the generation of a migraine.
These results indicate that cannabis may be an effective
treatment option for certain migraine sufferers.
Reports from 139 cluster headache patients56 indi-
cate that cannabis could have value in treating a
portion (25.9%) of these patients as well. However,
cannabis was reported to provoke cluster headache at-
tacks in some patients (22.4%) as well. One possible
explanation for this provoking effect is that cannabis
is known to increase heart rate, increase blood pressure,
and cause systemic vasodilation.67 Cluster headache
sufferers seem to be highly sensitive to vasodilation of
the carotid tree and increased oxygen demands, find-
ings that are supported by evidence that alcohol is a re-
liable trigger and supplemental oxygen is an effective
abortive therapy.68 The increased oxygen demand
and/or the vasodilation effects of cannabis could theo-
retically be responsible for this exacerbation in some
cluster headache sufferers. Interestingly, cluster head-
aches appear to show improvement with treatment
using hallucinogens such as d-lysergic acid amide (ergine
or LSA), psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD).33 As such, it is possible that the psychoactive
properties of THC could play a role in the treatment
of cluster headaches.
Case reports also give insights into the mechanisms
behind the anti-headache action of cannabis. Smoking
cannabis has been reported to relieve pain associated
with pseudotumor cerebri,57 a condition that is charac-
terized by an increase in the intracranial pressure of an
uncertain etiology. This suggests that the therapeutic
effect of cannabis in some headache conditions could
be a result of reducing intracranial pressure. In fact,
dexanabinol, a synthetic cannabinoid, has been found
to relieve intracranial pressure and improve outcomes
after traumatic brain injury.69
Cannabinoids and Headache Pathophysiology
The pathophysiological mechanisms of many headache
disorders are not entirely understood. Nevertheless,
preclinical data examining the effects of endocannabi-
noids on the neurological and vascular systems demon-
strate the influence of endocannabinoids in modulating
several major components of migraine pathogenesis
(Table 3 and Fig. 1).35,70–85
Underlying cause of headaches
Various genetic factors can predispose individuals to
migraines. For example, studies have shown that a de-
crease in expression of the cnr1 gene, which encodes
the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor, is as-
sociated with migraine and trigeminovascular activa-
tion.70 Women who experience migraine also have
increased activities of fatty acid amide hydrolase
(FAAH), an enzyme used to degrade the endocannabi-
noid anandamide (AEA), and the endocannabinoid
membrane transporter (EMT), a membrane trans-
porter for AEA, leading to an overall decrease in levels
of endocannabinoids.73 This finding could partially ex-
plain the increased prevalence of migraines in women.
An examination of cerebrospinal fluid shows that indi-
viduals who experience migraines have decreased levels
of AEA and increased levels of CGRP and NO (nor-
mally inhibited by AEA). These findings support the

 proposed theory that alterations in endocannabinoid
function with reductions in endocannabinoids such
as AEA may be one of the mechanisms underlying mi-
graine. A feature of headache disorders is that they are
highly associated with other comorbidities, including
anxiety and mood disorders, allergies, chronic pain dis-
orders, and epilepsy.86 The endocannabinoid defi-
ciency hypothesis provides a possible mechanism
underlying not only migraine but also diseases such
as
fibromyalgia
and
irritable
bowel
syndrome.72
Although the endocannabinoid deficiency hypothesis
is still speculative and in need of further study, it suggests
that exogenous stimulators of the endocannabinoid
system, such as cannabis, could treat these diseases at
their source.87
Glutamate signaling
One of the first subjective indicators of a migraine is the
occurrence of an aura, a perceptual abnormality that
often precedes a migraine attack. A wave of electro-
physiological hyperactivity followed by inhibition,
known as cortical spreading depression (CSD), is con-
sidered the neurobiological event underlying the mi-
graine aura. CSD has been shown to be a result of
excessive glutamate signaling, and one effect of endo-
cannabinoids is the suppression of glutamate signaling
via the inhibition of NMDA receptors.74 In fact, sup-
pression of CSD has been achieved by THC and canna-
binoid CB1 agonist activation of CB1 receptors in
murine models.75 This suggests a use for cannabis in
the prevention of the initial mechanisms triggering a
migraine aura and the subsequent pain.
Trigeminovascular activation
Another component of most headache disorders is
overactivation of the trigeminovascular system, the pri-
mary sensory nerve tree for the head. One of the most
reliable triggers for migraine is NO. Studies have dem-
onstrated the role of endocannabinoids in inhibiting
NO.76 Moreover, AEA has been shown to inhibit
dural vascular dilation caused by NO, CGRP, capsaicin,
and electric stimulation.77 This effect may seem para-
doxical, as cannabis is a known vasodilator and AEA
acts through the vanilloid receptor TRPV1 to cause di-
lation of the cranial blood vessels.88 However, because
cannabinoids such as THC bind preferentially with
CB1 receptors over TRPV1,89 concentration could de-
termine whether cannabinoids have a vasodilatory or
vasoconstrictive effect. For example, at low concentra-
tions, AEA inhibits neurogenic vasodilation, but at
higher concentrations, AEA will begin binding with
TRPV1 and induce vasodilation.88 This concentration-
dependent activation of TRPV1 may underlie some of
the paradoxical (e.g., anxiogenic, hyperalgesic) effects
of THC seen at higher doses. Moreover, vasodilation
is not necessarily pathogenic for headaches, and
endocannabinoid-induced vasodilation could desensi-
tize the vasculature to known headache progenitors,
such as NO. Interestingly, NO appears to also exert no-
ciceptive effects through FAAH, as deletion of an
FAAH inhibitor or addition of an FAAH inhibitor pre-
vents nociceptive reaction to NO.78 One could postu-
late a possible feedback effect wherein NO and
FAAH overpower endocannabinoids to illicit pain.
Platelet stabilization
The hematological properties within the dilated cranial
blood vessels themselves may also play an important
roleinthepathophysiologyofmigraine.Endocannabinoid
levels are reduced in the platelets of migraine patients,80
and women with migraine show increased FAAH and
EMT activation in their platelets.73 Research has indi-
cated that migraine might, in part, result from serotonin
that is released from aggregating platelets,90 a theory that
is supported by the efficacy of antiplatelet medications in
some migraine sufferers. Cannabinoid compounds have
been shown to stabilize platelets and prevent release of se-
rotonin from platelets during a migraine.91
Modulation of afferent nociceptive signals
Endocannabinoids have a well-established role in the
modulation of pain signals at the spinal level81 and
contribute to the descending modulation of pain
through brainstem nuclei.92 Endocannabinoids also in-
hibit trigeminovascular nociceptive processing with
dural inputs.93 The activation of the trigeminovascular
system leads to activation of cutaneous evoked afferent
A and C-fibers.93 Endocannabinoids inhibit these sig-
nals via projections from the periaqueductal gray
(PAG) and rostral ventral medulla.94–96 CB1 receptor
activation in the ventrolateral PAG has also been
shown to modulate nociceptive trigeminovascular
transmission in the trigeminocervical complex via acti-
vation of 5HT1B/1D receptors.85 Endocannabinoids
also influence serotonergic neurons within the brain-
stem dorsal raphe to modulate pain.83
Triptans, one of the most effective abortive treat-
ments for migraine and cluster headaches, are believed
to act through agonist effects on 5HT1B/1D receptors
on the nerve endings in cranial blood vessels,97 as

 well as brainstem regions, including the PAG,85 result-
ing in decreased release of pro-inflammatory neuropep-
tides such as substance P and CGRP and attenuation of
dural nociceptive responses. Since 5HT1B/1D antago-
nists can inhibit the CB1 modulation of nociceptive tri-
geminovascualr signals, triptans may induce their anti-
migraine
effects
by
activating
endocannabinoid-
containing neurons in the PAG.85
Discussion
Headache disorders are common, painful, and dis-
abling; moreover, treatment for these disorders is inad-
equate for many sufferers. Before cannabis was made
illegal, many prominent physicians praised its use in
the treatment of headache disorders. Reports from
this period emphasize the administration of consistent
and uniform doses and the titration of doses to mini-
mize intoxication. For prophylactic treatment, canna-
bis was typically given orally two to three times per
day, for weeks or even months,28,32,36–38 and for abor-
tive treatment, cannabis was given at higher oral doses
or smoked.19,41,42 If cannabis is to be reconsidered as a
treatment for headache, considering this historical per-
spective could improve the efficacy of treatments and
help inform future research.
Although there have not been any clinical trials of
cannabis as a treatment for headache to date, reports
indicate that cannabis is commonly used by patients
to self-medicate for headache disorders. A retrospective
analysis has shown a significant impact of cannabis in
treating migraine47 and a clinical trial of a synthetic
cannabinoid showed efficacy for MOH,53 but properly
designed placebo-controlled trials are needed to deter-
mine the true efficacy and complications of cannabis
treatment for headache disorders.
Preclinical studies examining the role of the endocan-
nabinoid system in migraine pathogenesis also suggest a
potential therapeutic value for cannabis in the treatment
of headache. It has been postulated that a general defi-
ciency in endocannabinoid tone could underlie headache
disorders.72 Cannabis also shows potential to interrupt
specific stages in the pathogenesis of headaches, includ-
ing glutamate signaling leading to CSD,75 cranial blood
vessel dilation caused by NO and CGRP,77 serotonin re-
lease from platelets,91 and afferent trigeminovascular no-
ciceptive inputs.85 Although these studies have suggested
an interesting relationship between endocannabinoids
and some pathogenic processes of headache disorders,
the mechanistic role of cannabis in preventing headache
disorders remains speculative.
The studies presented in this review indicate the im-
portance of further well-designed clinical trials of the
efficacy of cannabis in the treatment of headache disor-
ders. Because there are still many obstacles present in
constructing double-blind placebo-controlled clinical
trials of cannabis, the following list outlines various
other potential future investigations and recommenda-
tions based on the findings presented in this review.
1. The development of dosing and treatment guide-
lines for the use of cannabis in the treatment of
headache disorders. Physicians should consider
discussing dosing strategies when recommend-
ing cannabis as headache treatment, with the
aim of maximizing efficacy and minimizing
harm. A focus on dose consistency through the
use of oral cannabinoids or metered-dose inhalers
could benefit future clinical trials by allowing for
easier blinding and placebo control. Moreover,
the use of oral cannabinoids could have unique
benefits in the prophylactic treatment of headache,
because it could avoid concentration peaks and in-
dividual differences in bioavailability.
2. Investigation of the anti-headache effect of canna-
bidiol (CBD). This review found no available infor-
mation on the use of CBD as a treatment for
headache. Nevertheless, CBD has shown efficacy
for headache-related conditions (i.e., anxiety),98
has demonstrated an analgesic role associated
with TRPV1 receptors,99 and can serve as a
5HT1a receptor agonist.100
3. Identification of variables that could predict treat-
ment receptivity in headache patients. This could
include stratification of headache disorders or pa-
tients based on sex, genetics, metabolic function,
or neuronal biomarkers.
4. Investigation of the long-term risks of cannabis
treatment for headaches. This should aim at quan-
tifying any side effects, withdrawal symptoms,
dependence, refractory headaches, or negative out-
comes from cannabis treatment for headaches.
5. Evaluation of other anti-headache drugs that tar-
get the endocannabinoid system. Preclinical data
suggest the possible use of FAAH or EMT inhib-
itors, which might have unique efficacy in female
migraineurs.
6. Evaluation of cannabis in combination treatment
(with analgesic or other anti-headache medications)
or as a second-line treatment in patients who are re-
fractory to traditional medications.

 Conclusion
The present review examines the historical guidelines
for cannabis treatment of headache, available clinical
data on the use of cannabis for headache, and pre-
clinical literature on the role of the endocannabinoid
system in headache pathophysiology. From this ex-
amination, various methodological recommenda-
tions are made for future studies and potentially novel
treatment practices are considered. Although placebo-
controlled clinical trials are still needed to appropri-
ately determine efficacy, it appears likely that cannabis
will emerge as a potential treatment for some head-
ache sufferers.
