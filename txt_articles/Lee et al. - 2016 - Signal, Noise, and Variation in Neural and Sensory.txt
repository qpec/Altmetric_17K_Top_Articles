In Brief
Latency variation is correlated across
sensory neurons and is a major
contributor to variation in motor latency.
Neurons also have independent variation
in the latency of the underlying probability
of spiking; each neuron’s irregular spiking
causes surprisingly little independent
variation.

SUMMARY
Analysis of the neural code for sensory-motor la-
tency in smooth pursuit eye movements reveals gen-
eral principles of neural variation and the specific
origin of motor latency. The trial-by-trial variation in
neural latency in MT comprises a shared component
expressed as neuron-neuron latency correlations
and an independent component that is local to
each neuron. The independent component arises
heavily from fluctuations in the underlying probability
of spiking, with an unexpectedly small contribution
from the stochastic nature of spiking itself. The
shared component causes the latency of single-
neuron responses in MT to be weakly predictive of
the behavioral latency of pursuit. Neural latency
deeper in the motor system is more strongly predic-
tive of behavioral latency. A model reproduces both
the variance of behavioral latency and the neuron-
behavior latency correlations in MT if it includes real-
istic neural latency variation, neuron-neuron latency
correlations in MT, and noisy gain control down-
stream of MT.
INTRODUCTION
To create accurate movements, the nervous system must deal
with the fact that neural responses vary from movement to move-
ment and, within a single movement, from neuron to neuron.
Some of the neuron-to-neuron variation is noise and can be elim-
inated by pooling across groups of nominally identical neurons.
But, some of the variation is correlated across neurons and is
more challenging to eliminate, at least by simple averaging.
The correlated, or shared, variation can propagate through a
sensory motor circuit and drive movement-by-movement varia-
tion in performance. Our goal is to understand the nature of mo-
tor variation, its representation in the nervous system, and how
neuron-by-neuron variation is managed.
The system we study, smooth pursuit eye movements, offers a
number of advantages that allow us to ask how neural circuits
operate in the face of variation. The architecture of the neural cir-
cuit for pursuit is known (Figure 1). We can record and quantify
the latency and amplitude of neural responses at many sites in
the circuit. We already know from a thorough analysis of trial-
by-trial variation in pursuit behavior (Osborne et al., 2005) and
neural responses (Hohl et al., 2013; Lee and Lisberger, 2013)
how pursuit speed and direction are controlled by the represen-
tations of target speed and direction in the middle temporal
visual area (MT). In line with the general theory outlined in the
prior paragraph, our analysis revealed two components of
variation in the spike frequency of MT neurons. One component
is shared, presumably results from common inputs to MT
neurons, and propagates through the sensory motor circuit to
create movement-by-movement variation in pursuit direction
and speed. A second component is independent in each neuron,
has been presumed to arise from the stochastic nature of
spiking, and can be eliminated by averaging across large popu-
lations of neurons.
Our goal in the present study was to use sensory-motor la-
tency to understand better how variation is processed in the ner-
vous system. Latency varies from trial to trial and also depends
on many features of a behavioral task, including the modality
of the sensory input, the strength of a sensory stimulus, the con-
tingencies of the behavioral task, and the level of attention to the
stimulus. In vision, for example, brighter stimuli cause neural re-
sponses with shorter latencies as well as shorter behavioral re-
action times (Lisberger and Westbrook, 1985; Miles et al.,
1986; Gawne et al., 1996; Warzecha and Egelhaaf, 2000; Bell
et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007; Sundberg et al., 2012). Also, audi-
tory sensory neural responses have short latencies compared
to visual sensory responses (Celesia and Puletti, 1971; Clark
et al., 1994), as do the motor responses to acoustic versus visual
stimuli (Shelton and Kumar, 2010).
Sensory latency defines motor latency to a large degree, but
the simple relationships between stimulus and response may
belie more complex and interesting internal neural processing.
In some paradigms, for example, neural activity ramps to a
threshold that appears to trigger a motor response (Hanes and
Schall, 1996; Roitman and Shadlen, 2002). The rate of rise of
the ramp, and therefore the behavioral reaction time, could
vary from movement to movement, perhaps as a function of
the strength of the evidence favoring a given movement (Gold
and Shadlen, 2002; Roitman and Shadlen, 2002), the magnitude

 of the expected reward (Hikosaka and Watanabe, 2000; Holler-
man et al., 1998; Metzger et al., 2006; Takikawa et al., 2002),
or the subject’s level of attention (Herrington and Assad, 2009).
Even for a simple visual-motor reflex, the ocular following
response, latency can be explained by a model that integrates
the sensory signal to a threshold, reaching the threshold sooner
for stimuli of higher contrast (Miles et al., 1986). In pursuit eye
movements, behavioral evidence suggests that latency variation
represents sensory errors in estimating the time when the target
started to move (Osborne et al., 2005). However, the behavioral
evidence is mute on the form of the sensory variation. Does sen-
sory latency vary in lock-step with motor latency? Or does inte-
gration of variable sensory amplitudes lead to ramps that reach
threshold at varying times?
In this paper, we measure the variation in the estimates of la-
tency in area MT, as well as in downstream motor areas. In broad
strokes, the resulting picture agrees with that for speed and di-
rection. The code for latency contains shared variation that is ex-
pressed as neuron-neuron latency correlations. The shared vari-
ation in MT, when amplified by a noisy downstream gain control,
is sufficient to account for the behavioral variation in latency.
However, a surprise arises from analysis of the sources of inde-
pendent variation in latency in MT. Much of the independent vari-
ation is present in the underlying probability of spiking, which we
equate loosely with the integrated synaptic inputs to the neuron.
An unexpectedly small amount of the independent variation
could be attributed to the stochastic nature of spiking. We think
that our analysis provides lessons for the processing of neural
signals more generally.
RESULTS
Our approach was to study the trial-by-trial relationship between
the latency of smooth pursuit eye movements and the latency of
neural responses in extrastriate area MT. Our data show that
40%–70% of the trial-by-trial variation in behavioral latency
can be attributed to correlated variation in the latency of re-
sponses to moving stimuli in MT; our modeling suggests poten-
tial sources of the remaining latency variation. In the course of
analyzing and modeling our data, we also discovered a surpris-
ing feature of how noise is managed as signals pass through a
neural circuit.
We have reanalyzed, for new purposes, previously published
recordings of the electrical activity of single neurons and pairs
of single neurons in extrastriate visual area MT (Lee and Lis-
berger, 2013), as well as single neurons in the floccular complex
of the cerebellar cortex and two groups of brainstem neurons
(Joshua et al., 2013; Medina and Lisberger, 2007). During re-
cordings, monkeys tracked a step-ramp of target position (Fig-
ure 2A) after Rashbass (1961). After a short reaction time of
�100 ms, monkeys initiate smooth eye movements in the direc-
tion of target motion. A target step customized for the ramp
speed compensates for the latency of pursuit and allows mon-
keys to produce smooth eye movements without saccades, or
with saccades delayed sufficiently beyond the initiation of pur-
suit to allow us to analyze saccade-free initiation of smooth pur-
suit. For each recording session, we presented many repetitions
of the same small number of step-ramp target motions.
Relationship between Pursuit Latency and Neural
Latency
We first estimated the strength of the trial-by-trial relationship
between neural latency and behavioral latency (gray traces in
Figure 2A). We used an objective method to evaluate pursuit la-
tency for each behavioral trial (see the Experimental Proce-
dures), and we sorted all trials for a given neuron into five groups
(quintiles) according to pursuit latency. For each quintile, we
used a similar objective method to estimate the latency and
amplitude of the mean spike density function (see the Experi-
mental Procedures). The example MT neuron analyzed in Figures
2B and 2C shows a clear progression of neural response la-
tencies in relation to the five groups of behavioral response la-
tencies. Regression analysis shows a strong and statistically sig-
nificant relationship between neural latency and behavioral
latency (Figure 2D; t test, p < 0.05) and a much weaker relation-
ship between neural response amplitude and behavioral latency
(Figure 2E).
The strength of the relationship between neural latency and
behavioral latency increases as the signals progress from MT
to the final motor pathway (Figure 2F; Figures S1A–S1D). For
each neuron, we computed the sensitivity of neural latency to
behavioral latency as the slope of the regression line (Figure 2D).
Sensitivity averaged 0.18 for neurons from area MT and
increased to 0.77 for Purkinje cells in the cerebellar floccular
complex. Sensitivity was approximately 1 for the last-order
brainstem interneurons that receive monosynaptic inhibition
from the floccular complex (floccular target neurons [FTNs])
and for neurons in the Abducens nucleus. In contrast, we found

 no consistent relationship between neural response amplitude
and pursuit latency in any of the four areas we studied
(Figure 2G).
We conclude that neural latency rather than response ampli-
tude determines behavioral latency. At least for the conditions
we used, pursuit latency does not appear to be determined by
a ramp-to-threshold mechanism. This conclusion is supported
by the observation that mean pursuit latency tracks mean neural
latency in MT almost perfectly when we change the form or
contrast of the moving visual stimulus (S.G.L. and J. Yang, un-
published data).
Trial-by-Trial Correlation between Pursuit Latency and
Neural Latency
The nervous system relies on single spike trains of many neurons
to generate a motor response to a single presentation of a stim-
ulus. To understand how a population of neurons encodes the la-
tency of a behavioral response, we analyzed the trial-by-trial
variation in neural latencies and its correlation (1) among MT
neurons and (2) between MT neurons and pursuit latency.
Previously, the magnitude and sign of neuron-behavior ampli-
tude correlations has been informative about the details of neural
processing downstream from area MT (Hohl et al., 2013).
To estimate neuron-behavior latency correlations, we used the
fact that the regression slope of Z scored data is equal to Pear-
son’s correlation coefficient (Rodgers and Nicewander, 1988).
We estimated neural latency and behavioral latency in each trial
(see the Experimental Procedures), binned the trials for each
neuron into five equal-sized quintiles ordered by response la-
tency (Figure 3A), and plotted the Z scored neural versus behav-
ioral latencies (Figures 3C and 3D). For Z scoring, we estimated
the SD of the latency of neural responses by plotting average la-
tency in each of the quintiles as the x values in a distribution (Fig-
ures 3B, blue symbols) and fitting a Gaussian with the constraint
that the x value for each point was the mean of one of the quin-
tiles of the Gaussian.
The example neuron illustrated in Figure 3 showed a trial-by-
trial correlation of 0.55 between neural latency and pursuit
latency (Figure 3C) and a weaker correlation of 0.13 between
neural response magnitude and pursuit latency (Figure 3D). We
obtained very similar results when we analyzed data from single
trials (gray symbols), instead of the averages for the five quintiles
(large black symbols), and when we binned the data according to
neural latency instead of pursuit latency.
For the four populations of neurons we analyzed, the neuron-
behavior latency correlations increased as signals passed
through the pursuit circuit. Values averaged 0.15 in area MT,
and they increased to 0.37 in floccular Purkinje cells and about
0.6 in FTNs and Abducens neurons (Figure 3E; see Figures
S1E–S1H for population histograms). In contrast, the trial-by-
trial correlation between neural response magnitude and pursuit
latency, obtained through a procedure analogous to the latency
analysis, was very close to zero in all four areas (Figure 3F;
Figures S1I–S1L). This supports our conclusion that neural
latency rather than response amplitude determines behavioral
latency.

 Validation of Computational Methods for Estimating
Neural Latency
Measurement of neural latencies from single trials is challenging,
especially for cortical neurons with irregular spiking. To provide
an independent test of the veracity of our methods, we created
model neurons with artificial spike trains where we controlled
the latency in each trial. Analysis of the model spike trains with
the same procedures used for our real data confirmed that we
were able to recover the latencies used to generate each model
spike train.
For each run of the simulation, we started with the mean prob-
ability of spiking from our population of MT neurons (Figure 4A),
and we jittered it in time with an SD of 20 ms to create 100 under-
lying probabilities of spiking with 100 different, known latencies.
Then, we generated three spike trains (see the Experimental Pro-
cedures) for each trial using three different coefficients of varia-
tion (CVs, 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0). We evaluated the latency of each
model spike train, and we measured the correlation between es-
timates of latency and the known latency in each model trial. We
did so either using data from individual trials or by binning the tri-
als into quintiles as before.
Our analysis revealed strong but imperfect correlations be-
tween the latency of the underlying probability of spiking and
the measured latency (Figure 4B). As expected, the stochastic
nature of spiking introduces some independent variation in neu-
ral latency. Thus, the correlation between the latency of the un-
derlying probability of spiking and the measured latency of the
model spike trains decreased as the CV of the artificial spiking
increased. The correlation was larger for the quintiled data, indi-
cating that our analysis improved marginally the estimates of the
actual latency. Of course, it is not possible to dissociate how
much of the independent noise in this model comes from neu-
ron’s spiking statistics (CV) and how much comes from mea-
surement errors. However, we are reassured by the fact that
the quintile analysis was able to recover 36% of the variance of
the latency of the underlying probability of spiking when the CV
was 1 and much more when the CV was 0.4 (Figure 4B).
Several observations demonstrate that our measures of la-
tency were not influenced by response amplitude. First, when
we created model spike trains with fluctuations in both response

 latency and amplitude, measured latency was correlated only
with actual latency and measured rate was correlated only with
actual rate (Figures 4C and 4D). The response amplitudes of
the model spike trains varied by a scale factor of SD 0.4, and la-
tencies had an SD of 20 ms. Second, the sensitivity of behavioral
latency to neural latency was unaffected by restricting the range
of neural response amplitudes to ± 0.4 or ± 0.8 SDs of the mean
response amplitude for each neuron (Figure S2A). Even though
the neural latency varied systematically, the neural response
amplitude was invariant across the quintiles for both the full
dataset and the analysis of trials with response amplitudes within
0.8 SD of the mean (Figure S2B). Finally, if neural response
amplitude had a systematic influence on our estimates of la-
tency, then correlations between behavioral latency and neural
response amplitude should have appeared in our data. They
did not (Figures 2F and 2G).
Neuron-Neuron Latency Correlations in MT
Correlated variation of neural responses within a population is an
important factor in determining the magnitude of the variation of
decoded population output (Zohary et al., 1994; Huang and Lis-
berger, 2009; Moreno-Bote et al., 2014) as well as the neuron-
behavior correlations (Shadlen et al., 1996; Lee and Lisberger,
2013). Indeed, without neuron-neuron correlations, averaging
across the large number of neurons in MT should render behav-
ioral variation very small and preclude neuron-behavior correla-
tions (Schoppik et al., 2008). Therefore, our next step was to
analyze neuron-neuron latency correlations for 40 pairs of MT
neurons that met two criteria as follows: (1) >50 repetitions of a
stimulus that evoked responses statistically higher than baseline
firing rate in both neurons; and (2) mean response latencies of
both neurons <100 ms.
Neuron-neuron latency correlations were present in many
pairs of neurons. The simplest demonstration of this phenome-
non comes from averaging the firing rate of one neuron in a
pair within the quintiles defined by the single-trial neural latencies
of the other neuron (Figures 5A–5D). The average firing rates
separated to a greater extent when ordered by each neuron itself
(Figures 5A and 5B), but they still showed a correlated progres-
sion when ordered by the latencies of the other neuron (Figures
5C and 5D). Analysis of the Z scored data revealed neuron-
neuron latency correlations that were statistically significant
(slopes different from zero, F test, p < 0.05) in Figures 5F and
5G for the analyses based on both the quintiles (large black sym-
bols) and the individual trials (gray symbols). The neuron-neuron
latency correlations tended to be positive across our whole sam-
ple of MT neurons (Figure 5E), and the mean correlation of �0.1
was significantly different from zero (p < 10�5, two-tailed t test).
Details of how we estimated neuron-neuron latency correlations
appear in the Experimental Procedures.
Components of Variation in Neural Latencies
Up to this point, we have considered the relationship between
neural latency and behavioral latency, in effect analyzing a
decoding question. Now, we turn to analysis of the encoding
of latency by using a computational approach to understand
the origin of the variation in latencies of the spike trains of MT
neurons. We ask whether variation in what we call the underlying
probability of spiking aligns with the shared component of varia-
tion in neural latency, while the stochastic nature of spike timing
aligns with the independent component.
First, we estimated the variation in the latency of the underlying
probability of spiking. We represented the underlying probability

 of spiking for each neuron as the average spike density function
across 50–100 trials. We then simulated the underlying probabil-
ity of spiking in individual trials by jittering the mean response in
time according to a Gaussian distribution with an SD of sprob. We
created a model spike train for each jittered trace, constrained to
have the same CV of interspike intervals as the neuron being
modeled. We estimated the neural latency of each simulated
spike train and calculated the SD of latency, sspikes. We repeated
the simulations using a range of values of sprob and established
the relationship between sprob and sspikes for each neuron (Fig-
ure 6A). We then estimated the actual SD of the latency of the un-
derlying probability of spiking as the value sprob for the value of
sspikes that matched our original analysis of the actual data.
The analysis in Figure 6 divides latency variation into two com-
ponents that are due to the underlying probability of spiking (the
inputs to a neuron?) and the stochastic timing of spikes in each
trial. Almost all MT neurons showed non-zero values of the SD of
the latency of the underlying probability of spiking, and many
showed SDs that were quite large (x axis of Figure 6B). We
take this as evidence that variation in the underlying probability
of spiking is a major contributor to the variation in the latency
of neural responses in MT. In Figure 6B, the vertical distance
from each symbol to the line of slope 1 shows the surprisingly
small contribution of the stochastic timing of spikes to variation
in neural latency.
Next we estimated the trial-by-trial MT-pursuit latency correla-
tions between spiking probability and the eye velocity in the initi-
ation of smooth pursuit. To do so, we used the following relation-
ship (derived in the Experimental Procedures):
Rprob;eyezRspikes;eye
sðLspikesÞ
sðLprobÞ
(Equation 1)
Here Rprob,eye and Rspikes,eye define the MT-pursuit latency corre-
lations for the underlying probability of spiking and the actual
spike trains, and sprob and sspikes were defined earlier. We can
compute Rprob,eye because we measured Rspikes,eye and sspikes,
and we can read the value of sprob off of graphs like Figure 6A.
The neuron-behavior latency correlation for the underlying
probability of spiking averaged 0.28 across our sample of neu-
rons (Figure 6C, black bars), compared to an average correlation
of 0.15 for the latency of spike trains (Figure 6C, gray bars). Thus,
the latency of the underlying probability of spiking of the average
MT neuron explains �8% of pursuit latency variation. This num-
ber seems large, considering the number of synapses between
area MT and the final behavior and the number of neurons in
area MT. However, we also note that the neuron-behavior la-
tency correlation for the underlying probability of spiking would
be 1 if all independent variation were attributed to the stochastic
nature of spiking. We conclude that trial-by-trial variation in the
underlying probability of firing is an important contributor to inde-
pendent variation in neural latency in MT. Subsequently we eval-
uate quantitatively how much of the latency variation might arise
downstream of MT (Schoppik et al., 2008).
We estimated the neuron-neuron latency correlation for the
underlying probability of spiking using the same computational
approach described above. We created a computational model
of each pair of neurons, created neuron-neuron correlation in the
underlying probability of spiking, and laid down simulated spike
trains for each trial in each neuron (see the Experimental Proce-
dures). We analyzed the correlations between the model spike
trains for many different values of correlation of the underlying
probability of firing. The analysis created graphs of neuron-
neuron correlation for spike trains as a function of that for the
underlying probability of spiking (e.g., Figure 6D). We fitted a

 regression line to the measurements, and we used the line to es-
timate the neuron-neuron latency correlation for the underlying
probability of spiking given that for the actual spike trains of
the two neurons. We excluded 12 pairs of MT neurons where
the regression analysis explained less than 40% of the variance
in graphs like Figure 6D. Three pairs yielded estimates of latency
correlation in the underlying probability of spiking that were
slightly greater than 1; we set those values to one.
Neuron-neuron latency correlations in the underlying probabil-
ity of spiking ranged from �0.5 to 1, as shown in the marginal his-
togram of Figure 6E. They averaged 0.29 and were about four
times larger than the correlations for spike trains. Figure 6E sug-
gests a structure in the neuron-neuron correlations, where pairs
of neurons with more similar latencies had higher values of cor-
relation. However, the small number of pairs in our sample made
it impossible to specify an equation that would describe the
structure or to verify the statistical significance of the suggested
structure.
It is noteworthy that the values of neuron-neuron latency cor-
relation for the underlying probability of spiking are well below
one for most pairs of neurons; therefore, there is considerable
independent variation in the underlying probability of spiking.
We conclude that the independent and shared components of
neural latency variation do not map directly onto the variation
caused by stochastic, irregular spike timing and shared inputs.
Further, the low neuron-neuron latency correlations agree with
our finding of relatively small neural-behavior latency correla-
tions for the underlying probability to spiking. They imply that
low neuron-neuron latency correlations, rather than downstream
noise, probably cause the low values of neuron-behavior latency
correlation.
A Sensory Source for Variation in Pursuit Latency?
The analyses we have completed so far enable a computational
analysis to quantify how much of the variation in pursuit latency
can arise from correlated variation in neural latency in MT. We
simulated a population of 1,000 spiking MT neurons that
mimicked (1) the neuron-neuron latency correlations between
underlying probability of spiking, (2) the mean and variance of
firing rate as a function of time, and (3) the latency variation
and CV of our sample of MT neurons (see the Experimental Pro-
cedures). It was critical to know the distribution of neuron-neuron
correlations in underlying probability of spiking for this exercise
(red curve in marginal histogram of Figure 6E), because there
is no other way to create spike trains with correlated latencies
other than starting from the underlying probability of firing. We
ran the simulation 200 times to represent 200 trials of target mo-
tion. For each simulated trial, we used a linear decoder to pool
the 1,000 spike trains from the neurons in the population and
create a population spike density function as follows:
_
E
0ðtÞ =
X
i = 1;1000
Gðs = 10 msÞ5ai S
!
iðtÞ
(Equation 2)
where _
E
0ðtÞ is the simulated eye velocity as a function of time, ai is
the decoding weight for the ith model neuron, G denotes a
Gaussian function with s = 10 ms, and S
!
iðtÞ is the spike train.
We estimated behavioral latency on each simulated trial using
_
E
0ðtÞ the same way we had for the pursuit data.
Decoding the model MT population response could account
for up to 7 ms of the 10 ms SD of the actual latency of pursuit re-
ported by Osborne et al. (2005). The exact prediction depended
on our assumptions about neuron-neuron latency correlations.
The SD of the predicted latency was close to zero when we set
the neuron-neuron latency correlations to the biologically unrea-
sonable value of zero (Figure 6F, black filled diamond). The SD of
predicted latency increased to 7 ms as we increased the delta-
latency constant of the structure in neuron-neuron latency corre-
lations up to a value of 24 ms (the red curve in Figure 6E). The SD
of the predicted latency was 4 ms when we assumed a Gaussian
distribution of otherwise unstructured neuron-neuron latency
corrections across the MT population with a mean value equal
to the mean of 0.29 in our data (Figure 6F, open circle). Doubling
or halving the number of neurons in the simulation did not alter
these conclusions.
The conclusions from Figure 6F depend to some degree on as-
sumptions about how the MT population is decoded to drive eye
velocity. Reasoned changes in the decoder’s weights could in-
crease or decrease the predicted behavioral latency variation.
For example, weighting each neuron in proportion to its neural
latency variation or its mean neuron-neuron latency correlation
with its neighbors increased the predicted variation of behavior
latency. Weightings in inverse proportion of those parameters
decreased the predicted variation in behavioral latency. The
magnitude of these effects was fairly small but could be
enhanced by widening the range of decoding weights. At an
extreme, driving pursuit only with neurons that lack neuron-
neuron latency correlations with their neighbors would create
the situation where MT contributes nothing to the variation in
behavioral latency. We return to this issue in the Discussion,
but for now we suggest that the correlated latency variation in
MT probably accounts for 40%–70%, but not all, of the variation
in pursuit latency.
Sensory Latency Variation and Downstream
Multiplicative Noise Can Account Fully for the
Behavioral Latency Variation and Neuron-Behavior
Latency Correlations
As a final step, we evaluated whether a source of variation down-
stream of MT could increase the variation in the pursuit latency
predicted by our model. We needed to ask this question care-
fully. While downstream noise definitely would increase the pre-
dicted variation in pursuit latency, it would have the undesirable
effect of reducing the magnitude of MT-pursuit latency correla-
tions (Schoppik et al., 2008). In Figure 7, we search for a form
of downstream noise that (1) amplifies the latency variation
emerging from MT to predict an SD of pursuit latency of 10 ms
and (2) predicts MT-pursuit latency correlations of �0.28 for
the underlying probability of firing.
We started with the model MT population that assumed a
Gaussian structure of neuron-neuron latency correlations with
a mean of 0.29 and equal decoding weights for all model neu-
rons. Recall that this model predicted an SD of pursuit latency
of 4 ms (Figure 6F). We then explored the effects of altering the
decoded signals with different kinds of noise. As before, we
ran the simulation 200 times to simulate 200 behavioral trials,
computed the mean population spike density function as a

171
 template, and then estimated the latency for each trial by shifting
and scaling the template.
We created downstream noise using Gaussian functions
G(m,s), with mean and SD equal to m and s. The full model al-
lowed both parameters of G(m,s) to vary and defined the trajec-
tory of pursuit as follows:
PðtÞ = h,
P
i
MTiðtÞ
N
(Equation 3)
where P(t) is the pursuit output, h is a random variable drawn
from the distribution G(m,s), MTi(t) is the time-varying spike den-
sity function of the ith model MT neuron, and N = 1,000 model MT
neurons. We allowed m to vary from 1 to 2.5 and s to vary from
0 to 0.5 and ran the model for the full distribution of both param-
eters. We computed the SD of the decoded latency and the
mean model neuron-behavior latency correlations for each of
the pairs of parameter values.
A model with multiplicative downstream noise accounted
for all the statistics of our data. In Figures 7B and 7C, the gray
scale indicates how much the performance of the model devi-
ated from that of the actual data as a function of m and s. Darker
colors show parameters that matched the data better. The red
circles indicate a set of parameters that matched the SD of la-
tency and the MT-pursuit correlations (m = 1.4 and s = 0.22).
These parameters implement a noisy downstream gain control
(Figure 7D).
Other downstream noise models performed less well. When
we constrained m to be 1.0 so that the model implemented mul-
tiplicative noise without a gain adjustment, the parameters that
reproduced the SD of pursuit latency underestimated the
measured values of MT-pursuit latency correlations (Figure 7D).
The model failed in exactly the same way when we changed it to
implement additive noise as follows:
PðtÞ = h +
P
i
MTiðtÞ
N
(Equation 4)
We conclude that a specific model can reproduce the full statis-
tics of pursuit latency, including its variation and the magnitude
of MT-pursuit latency correlations. Latency variation would arise
from correlated latency variation in MT and be amplified by a
specific form of downstream noise. The downstream noise could
be a second independent source of variation in pursuit latency,
or it might be driven by the correlated variation in MT. In the
latter scenario, the entire variation in pursuit latency would arise
from MT.
DISCUSSION
We have made two steps forward in understanding how a sen-
sory code is created and converted into action. First, our analysis
of neural responses at multiple levels of the pursuit circuit has
provided the first complete account of the evolution of response
latency through a sensory-motor circuit. Second, detailed anal-
ysis of the statistics of MT neuron responses has revealed poten-
tially important new insights into neural codes for sensation and
action. Our analysis suggests a change in the paradigm for un-
derstanding the origins of variation in neural responses and
how that variation is (and is not) reduced through downstream
decoding.
Pitfalls in Measuring Latency from Spike Trains
The challenges of estimating neural latency from noisy spike
timing in single behavioral trials forced us to use approximations
to estimate the trial-by-trial relationship between neural latency
and behavioral latency. We partitioned the trials from a given
neural recording session into five quintiles according to their la-
tencies, and we estimated the latency of each spike train itera-
tively using an objective Bayesian approach. Comparison with
the results of more standard data analysis approaches showed
that our approach reduced the effects of measurement noise
by 10%–20%. Also, because our correlation analysis relies on
computing a regression slope for Z scored data, it should be
resilient against contamination by independent noise.
Our approach avoids the artifacts caused by tradeoffs be-
tween latency and magnitude. These would have contaminated
our analysis if, for example, we had estimated response magni-
tude separately in fixed analysis windows (Lee et al., 2010). Other
analysis methods have potential problems. The time when a

 neural response goes more than two SDs above the resting
response depends on the rate of rise of the neural response.
The time when the neural response reaches a fixed percentage
of the peak response depends on the time and size of the
peak. By scaling carefully chosen templates and shifting them
in time, we think we have obtained excellent estimates of the la-
tency and amplitude of neural responses or eye velocity. Our
approach measures latency independent of response amplitude,
and it reproduces the known latency well in models of neural
spike trains.
Independent versus Shared Variation in Neural
Responses
Prior analyses of the amplitude of neural responses and their ef-
fect on behavioral output have broken the trial-by-trial variation
of neural responses into two components. A shared component
seems to be controlled by inputs that are distributed widely to a
population of sensory neurons. It may arise from top-down influ-
ences, such as general cortical excitability or attention (Goris
et al., 2014), or from variation that arises early in sensory pro-
cessing (Chaisanguanthum et al., 2014). The shared component
is expressed as trial-by-trial correlations in the responses of
pairs of neurons to repetitions of a given sensory stimulus. The
shared component of variation has a domino effect through the
system and plays a major role in determining the magnitude of
behavioral variation. An independent component is different in
different neurons and, therefore, can be averaged away and
does not have an impact on behavioral variation. At least tacitly,
the field seems to attribute the shared component of variation to
fluctuations in the integrated synaptic drive to a neuron, which
we call underlying probability of spiking, and the independent
component to the stochastic nature of spiking (Chaisanguan-
thum et al., 2014; Goris et al., 2014).
Our analysis suggests that a somewhat different framework
holds, at least for neural latency and behavioral latency. In partic-
ular, we show that independent variation is present in the under-
lying probability of spiking. It cannot be attributed entirely, or
even largely, to noise added by irregular spiking. Computational
approaches allowed us to estimate the neuron-neuron and
neuron-behavior latency correlations for the underlying probabil-
ity of spiking, revealing values much lower than we would expect
if the independent latency noise arose only from the stochastic
nature of spiking. On average, the underlying probability of
spiking for each MT neuron can explain only about 8% of pursuit
latency variance. Similarly, neuron-neuron latency correlations
for underlying spiking probabilities averaged only 0.29. If inde-
pendent variation arose only from the stochastic nature of
spiking, then we would expect higher values of correlation. The
low value of neuron-neuron latency correlations for the underly-
ing probability of spiking is particularly telling because it does not
depend on assumptions about noise added downstream of MT.
The presence of independent latency variation in the underly-
ing probability of spiking raises the following two questions: (1)
how does it get there, and (2) is this also true for the amplitude
of firing rate? The latter question will have to be evaluated by
future analyses. In regard to the former question, we suspect
that limited convergence from processing stage to processing
stage in the visual cortex is responsible for the appearance of in-
dependent variation in the underlying probability of spiking.
Consider the following two extremes: if each MT neuron received
its synaptic inputs from only one V1 neuron, then the indepen-
dent variation of the V1 neuron would contribute substantial vari-
ation in the underlying probability of spiking; and if each MT
neuron received its synaptic inputs from many V1 neurons,
then the independent variation in V1 spiking would average
away and we would not have found evidence for independent
variation in the underlying probability of spiking. We suggest
that the amount of convergence in the inputs to MT neurons is
small enough so that independent variation is not averaged
away. Alternatively, local cortical circuits could be responsible
for the appearance of independent variation in the underlying
probability of spiking.
The Origin of Behavioral Response Latency
Our analysis shows that neural latency determines behavioral
latency, at least in the system we study. Three features of neural
signal processing probably contribute to the increase in neuron-
behavior latency correlations as signals pass from MT to the cer-
ebellum to the brainstem. First, the cerebellum and brainstem
almost certainly are downstream of any additional noise sources,
such as the noisy gain control we suggest, so the trial-by-trial
relationship between neural latency and behavioral latency
should be stronger (Schoppik et al., 2008). Second, the indepen-
dent noise contributed by the stochastic nature of spiking
is considerably lower in the cerebellum compared to MT and
still lower in the brainstem oculomotor circuits (Ramachandran
and Lisberger, 2006). Lower independent noise leads to higher
neuron-behavior latency correlations. Third, anatomical conver-
gence may increase as signals pass into the motor system,
reducing the amount of independent variation in the underlying
probability of spiking and allowing neurons to signal the impend-
ing movement with higher fidelity.
Much of the current thinking about the creation of neural la-
tencies is based on examples of integrating neural activity to a
threshold. For example, Miles et al. (1986) explained the effect
of stimulus contrast and temporal frequency on the latency of
the ocular following response with a model that integrated
different visual response amplitudes to create ramps to
threshold at different rates. In complex tasks such as the coun-
termanding task for saccades (Hanes and Schall, 1996), a gap
saccade task (Dorris and Munoz, 1998), or a perceptual decision
task (Roitman and Shadlen, 2002), neurons in the superior colli-
culus and the parietal and frontal cortices show a ramp increase
in neural activity prior to saccades. Saccades occur when the
activity crosses a threshold. Our recordings do not fit with these
formulations because we did not see any consistent relationship
between neural response amplitudes and behavioral latencies.
The regime used by pursuit could be different because our
task minimizes cognitive influences and studies a highly reactive
sensory-motor behavior.
Analysis of variation in pursuit behavior led to the hypothesis
that sensory noise causes motor variation in pursuit (Osborne
et al., 2005). Recordings from MT provided neural support for
that hypothesis for pursuit direction and speed (Hohl et al.,
2013; Lee and Lisberger, 2013). Until this paper, however, the
source of latency variation was a matter of speculation and the

173
 tools for measuring latency with the requisite precision did not
exist. Now we have shown that MT can account for 40%–70%
of the variation in pursuit latency. A noisy downstream gain
element can account for the rest of the behavioral variation
while remaining consistent with our data on neuron-neuron and
neuron-behavior latency correlations. Previous studies have
shown that FEFSEM is involved in gain modulation of pursuit
amplitude (Tanaka and Lisberger, 2001) and could be the gain
control area for sensory estimates target speed and direction
(Lee et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2012); perhaps FEFSEM also pro-
vides a noisy gain control for pursuit latency. Further, the latency
variation contributed by the noisy gain control could be highly
correlated with the latency variation in MT, in which case MT
could be the sole contributor to pursuit latency variation. Or, la-
tency variation may be independent in MT and FEFSEM, in which
case each would contribute about equally.
Our conclusions about the contribution of MT latencies to pur-
suit latency depend on the properties of the decoder that con-
verts neural responses in MT into pursuit eye movements. We
assume that pursuit latency arises as a side effect of pooling
the population response in MT to estimate target direction and
speed. Thus, we think of latency as an emergent property of a
system that is designed to do something else, rather than as a
parameter that the decoder is trying to optimize in any way.
Our earlier papers imply that the decoder for pursuit is weighting
each neuron according to its preferred speed and/or direction
(Hohl et al., 2013). Thus, it seems unlikely that the decoder se-
lects weights that would minimize the impact of MT latency vari-
ation on pursuit latency variation. Namely, we doubt that it
weights neurons that lack neuron-neuron latency correlations
with their neighbors more heavily. Thus, we think that the
decoder used in our computational analysis probably is appro-
priate to simulate what actually happens in the nervous system.
Conclusions
Analysis of the neural code for behavioral latency has revealed
that neural latency drives behavioral latency, at least in the
reduced behavioral paradigms we used. The ramp-to-threshold
regime does not seem to apply to the initiation of pursuit eye
movements. Analysis of the correlations among the latencies
of neural spiking, the underlying probability of spiking, and pur-
suit behavior reveals that neuron-neuron correlations in a sen-
sory area make a large contribution to trial-to-trial variation in
behavioral latency. Further, independent variation appears to
have a strong presence in the underlying probability of spiking,
and the stochastic nature of spiking makes an unexpectedly
small contribution. These findings are based on analysis of a sim-
ple cortical sensory-motor behavior, but they may generalize to
many neural systems.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
We mined previously published data from six monkeys. The methods for
acquiring the data and the experimental design were described before (Joshua
et al., 2013; Lee and Lisberger, 2013; Medina and Lisberger, 2007). The data
recorded during step-ramp pursuit behavior include 135 neurons recorded
in extrastriate area MT, 40 Purkinje cells recorded in the floccular complex,
29 floccular target neurons recorded in the vestibular nucleus, and 40 Abdu-
cens neurons.
To analyze neural data, we combined responses to identical stimuli by align-
ing the spike trains on the onset of stimulus motion and summing the spikes
from all trials to create peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs). We measured
neural response amplitudes after creating spike density functions, by filtering
PSTHs with a Gaussian having an SD of 10 ms, and normalizing so that the
spike density function had the units of spikes/s. We computed averages of
eye velocity as a function of time on a millisecond timescale.
Estimation of Pursuit Latency and Relationship to Neural Latency
We used an objective procedure to quantify pursuit latency and gain for each
trial. We computed the average horizontal and vertical eye velocities across tri-
als and used the averages from 20 ms before to 100 ms after the initiation of
pursuit as templates. We shifted and scaled the templates to obtain the best
least-squares fit to the eye velocities from each individual trial. The free param-
eters of the fits were time shift (Dt), horizontal scale (Gh), and vertical scale (Gv).
The best-fitting value of Dt defined pursuit latency in each trial. We included a
trial in our analysis only if the best-fitting adjustment of the template accounted
for more than 90% of the variance of the actual eye velocities. We proceeded
to further analysis only if 50 or more trials passed this screen.
We determined the slope of the relationship between neural latency and pur-
suit latency by dividing the trials into five equal-sized groups (quintiles) accord-
ing to the latency of pursuit in each trial. We computed the mean eye velocity
and the mean spike density function for each quintile of trials. Then we created
templates by averaging the eye velocity and spike density functions for all the
trials in the interval from 20 ms before to 100 ms after the response onset. We
found the five values of time shift (Dt) and neural scaling factor (G) that provided
the best least-squares fit of the spike density template to the average spike
density functions for each quintile. We performed the same analysis using
the eye velocity template to fit each quintile’s average of eye velocity. The
values of Dt and G for the spike density functions and the eye velocity averages
defined the neural latency and response magnitude for each of the quintiles.
They allowed us to compute the slopes of the relationships between pursuit la-
tency and neural latency or response amplitude.
Calculation of Neuron-Behavior Latency Correlations
We estimated trial-by-trial correlations between neural latency and pursuit
latency by modifying a method from Bollimunta et al. (2007) to improve the
estimates of neural latency through several iterations of Bayesian inference.
1. We created a spike density function for each individual trial by
convolving each spike train with a Gaussian filter (s = 10 ms), and we
averaged across all trials to create a template.
2. We shifted and scaled the template to find the best fit, in the least-
square sense, to the spike density function for each individual trial.
This yielded a value of Dt and G for each trial and defined latency and
response gain.
3. We sorted the trials according to neural latency, created five equal-
sized groups (quintiles), and averaged across the spike density func-
tions within each quintile to create five templates.
4. We made five new estimates of neural latency for each trial, one using
each of the five templates, and we defined the trial’s neural latency ac-
cording to the Dt for the template that provided the best fit.
5. We repeated the sorting, template creation, and latency estimation pro-
cedure (steps 3 and 4) to further reduce estimation errors for neural
latency.
6. We shifted and scaled the original template to estimate the latencies of
the average spike density for each of the five final quintiles.
7. We used the average latencies of the quintiles of trials to anchor each of
the quintiles of a Gaussian function. The SD of the best-fitting Gaussian
provided an estimate of the SD of the measured neural latency.
The value of s for the Gaussian derived in step 7 allows us to estimate
neuron-behavior correlations for latency by taking advantage of the fact that
Pearson’s correlation coefficient is equal to the regression slope of data that
has been converted to Z scores (Rodgers and Nicewander, 1988).

 where Z(x) is the Z score of x, and Lspikes and Leye are the latencies of the neural
response and pursuit, respectively. We can rewrite Equation 5 in way that al-
lows us to estimate R from our data as follows:

either the pursuit latency or the neural latency as the independent variable. If
we define bn�b and bb�n as the regression slopes when neural latency or pur-
suit latency are the independent variables, then algebraic manipulation of
Equation 6 leads to the following:
R = s

We estimated the regression coefficient twice, using neural latency and pursuit
latency as the independent variables for grouping trials. In principal, the two
estimates should be the same. In practice, they are close to each other, but
not identical. We used their geometric average as an estimate of the trial-by-
trial correlation between given neuron’s latency and pursuit latency (Rodgers
and Nicewander, 1988) as follows:

We used an analogous procedure to estimate the correlation between the
latencies of responses of 40 pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, esti-
mating the latency of the responses of each neuron, rather than of one neu-
ron’s neural responses and pursuit.
Underlying Probability of Spiking
We derived a relationship that allows us to estimate the latency correlation be-
tween underlying spiking probability and pursuit from parameters that we can
measure. Variation in neural latency has the following two components: one in
the underlying probability of spiking and one in stochastic nature of spike
timing. The latter is independent across neurons, while the former may have
a component that is shared across neurons. We defined these two compo-
nents of variation as follows:
VarðLspikesÞ = VarðLprobÞ + VarðLindÞ
(Equation 9)
where Lspikes, Lprob, and Lind are the neural latencies of spike trains, the under-
lying probability of spiking, and the stochastic nature of spike timing, respec-
tively. We defined the MT-pursuit latency correlation we measured from spikes
as follows:

at the relevant site in the Results.
Computer Simulations
Our computer simulations created model MT neurons with realistic statistics
based on our data. We used the time-varying mean spike density function of
our population of MT neurons, or of individual neurons, to define the underlying
probability of spiking. For simulations of large populations, we defined each
model neuron’s mean latency by drawing from the distribution of latencies in
our data. We also drew the SD of latency for each neuron’s firing probability
from a Gamma distribution fitted to the distribution of latency variation for
the underlying probability of spiking in our data as follows:
sðLpÞ � Gðks; qsÞ
(Equation 14)
where sðLpÞ is the SD of neuron p’s firing probability latency, ks = 0.73 is
the shape parameter of the Gamma distribution, and qs = 12.3 is the scale
parameter. We then created 100 or 200 simulated trials for each neuron by
drawing a latency from Gaussian distributions having the SD assigned to
each neuron by Equation 14 and shifting the underlying probability of spiking
in time by that amount. We created different structures of neuron-neuron cor-
relations by varying the correlation matrix used in a Cholesky decomposition
as follows:
(1) To create model populations that lacked neuron-neuron latency corre-
lations, we used a matrix with all entries as zeros.
(2) To create model populations with uniform neuron-neuron latency cor-
relations that matched the mean and SD in our data, we used a matrix
with entries chosen randomly from a Gaussian distribution with a mean
of 0.29 and SD of 0.24.
(3) To create model populations with structured neuron-neuron correla-
tions that depended on the difference in latency between the two neu-
rons of a pair, we defined entries in the matrix according to the
following exponential:
ri; j = rmaxe�ðLi�LjÞ
2
t2
(Equation 15)
where ri,j is the correlation between neuron i and j, Li and Lj are the mean neural
latencies of neurons i and j, rmax is the maximum size of the correlations, and
t is the delta-latency constant of the exponential function. Based on our data,
we set rmax to be one.
At this point, we had defined the latency, amplitude, and trajectory of the
underlying probability of firing either for 100 trials of a single model neuron
or for 200 trials of 1,000 model neurons. We modeled the spike timing for
each trial as a renewal Gamma process whose parameters for the inter-
spike interval distribution were selected to match the CV of a given neuron.
Then, using the underlying probability of spiking estimated from the given
neuron as the rate function, we made spike trains by rescaling the time of
the Gamma process with a given time-dependent trajectory of the underly-
ing probability of spiking (Brown et al., 2002; Koyama and Shinomoto,
2005). The final step in the creation of model neural responses was to
measure the CV of the model spike trains and compute the time-varying
mean spike density function, exactly as we had in our analysis of the actual
data, to verify that our model neurons reproduced the statistics of the actual
data.
