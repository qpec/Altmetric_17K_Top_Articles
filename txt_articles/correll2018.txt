IMPORTANCE The value of early intervention in psychosis and allocation of public resources
has long been debated because outcomes in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders
have remained suboptimal.
OBJECTIVE To compare early intervention services (EIS) with treatment as usual (TAU) for
early-phase psychosis.
DATA SOURCES Systematic literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and
ClinicalTrials.gov without language restrictions through June 6, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials comparing EIS vs TAU in first-episode psychosis or
early-phase schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This systematic review was conducted according to
PRISMA guidelines. Three independent investigators extracted data for a random-effects
meta-analysis and prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary outcomes were all-cause treatment
discontinuation and at least 1 psychiatric hospitalization during the treatment period.
RESULTS Across 10 randomized clinical trials (mean [SD] trial duration, 16.2 [7.4] months;
range, 9-24 months) among 2176 patients (mean [SD] age, 27.5 [4.6] years; 1355 [62.3%]
male), EIS was associated with better outcomes than TAU at the end of treatment for all 13
meta-analyzable outcomes. These outcomes included the following: all-cause treatment
discontinuation (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61-0.80; P < .001), at least 1 psychiatric
hospitalization (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90; P = .003), involvement in school or work (RR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24; P = .01), total symptom severity (standardized mean difference [SMD],
−0.32; 95% CI, −0.47 to −0.17; P < .001), positive symptom severity (SMD, −0.22; 95% CI,
−0.32 to −0.11; P < .001), and negative symptom severity (SMD, −0.28; 95% CI, −0.42 to
−0.14; P < .001). Superiority of EIS regarding all outcomes was evident at 6, 9 to 12, and 18 to
24 months of treatment (except for general symptom severity and depressive symptom
severity at 18-24 months).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In early-phase psychosis, EIS are superior to TAU across all
meta-analyzable outcomes. These results support the need for funding and use of EIS in
patients with early-phase psychosis.

 O
utcomes in people with schizophrenia spectrum dis-
orders have remained suboptimal.1 Schizophrenia is
amongthe10mostdebilitatingdisordersintheUnited
States,2 being associated with high disability3 and enormous
personal and societal cost.1
The results of a 2013 meta-analysis4 suggested that, dur-
ing the last 5 decades, recovery from schizophrenia remained
low (median, 13.5%), without significantly improving. Fur-
thermore, individuals with schizophrenia die on average 15 to
20 years prematurely,5-7 with an increasing mortality gap.8 Be-
cause people with early-phase schizophrenia spectrum disor-
ders have not endured many years of illness and functional de-
cline and generally respond better to treatment, there has been
an increasing focus on early identification and optimized
treatment.1,9Severalresearchprogramsforpatientswithearly-
phase schizophrenia spectrum disorders yielded promising re-
sults for early intervention services (EIS) that are specifically
designed to meet the needs of patients with early-phase
psychosis.10 Early intervention services require a multidisci-
plinary team of mental health professionals who provide mul-
timodal treatment, including different psychosocial and psy-
chopharmacologicalinterventionsthataretailoredtotheneeds
of each patient. In EIS programs, these services are provided
from one team in a coordinated, integrated fashion instead of
referring patients to different health care providers for each
service.11-15 These programs aim at decreasing psychosis symp-
toms, improving functional outcomes, and reducing long-
term disability during what has been called a critical illness
period.16
In this context, the level of efficacy and effectiveness of
EIS for patients with first-episode and early-phase schizophre-
nia spectrum disorders has been debated. This debate is es-
pecially true given necessary societal decisions about re-
source allocation and funding in times of health care cost cuts
and frugality across the world.
To date, only 1 meta-analysis,17 which included 4 random-
ized clinical trials (RCTs), has compared the effectiveness of
EIS vs treatment as usual (TAU) for early-phase psychosis, in-
dicating superiority of EIS approaches. Aside from the lim-
ited number of studies included, only published data were
used, no subgroup or meta-regression analyses were con-
ducted, and the time course of the treatment effect was not
examined.
BecauseadditionalRCTs9,18-23ofEISvsTAUhavebeenpub-
lished, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all
available studies, including additional unpublished data that
we received from the authors of all meta-analyzed studies. We
hypothesized that EIS would be superior to TAU and ex-
pected that a more comprehensive assessment of the treat-
ment effects could inform our understanding of the influ-
ence of EIS programs and result in their refinement and
implementation across the world.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted according to Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A predetermined but unpub-
lished protocol was followed (eMethods 1 in the
Supplement).24,25
Literature Search
Three of us (B.G., A.P., and A.K.) independently conducted a
systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE,
and ClinicalTrials.gov through June 6, 2017, without lan-
guage restrictions. This search was supplemented by a manual
review of reference lists from eligible publications and rel-
evant review articles (eMethods 2 in the Supplement).
Inclusion Criteria
Inclusion criteria were 4-fold. First, a study had to be an
RCT to be included. Second, participants had to have a
study-defined diagnosis of first-episode psychosis or a
study-defined diagnosis of early-phase schizophrenia spec-
trum disorders (schizophrenia, psychotic disorder not
otherwise specified, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreni-
form disorder, or delusional disorder). Third, the study had
to have EIS specifically designed for the needs of people
with early-phase psychosis and consisting of a multimodal
treatment program, including several psychosocial and
psychopharmacological interventions (eg, case manage-
ment, psychotherapy, supported employment and educa-
tion, and family support) that are provided from one team
in a coordinated, integrated fashion. Fourth, the study had
to have a control group consisting of a nonspecialized TAU
protocol. Excluded were RCTs randomizing patients to
maintenance of EIS vs a step-down or less intense mainte-
nance treatment.
Data Abstraction
Three of us (B.G., A.P., and A.K.) independently identified,
checked, and extracted data from eligible trials for all fol-
low-up time points of the treatment phase. Inconsistencies
were resolved by involvement of a fourth reviewer (one of us,
C.U.C.). Authors were contacted for missing information or un-
published original data.
Key Points
Question Are early intervention services superior to treatment as
usual regarding symptom-related and illness-related treatment
outcomes in patients with early-phase psychosis?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 10 randomized clinical trials
(n = 2176 patients), early intervention services were associated
with better outcomes than treatment as usual at the end of
treatment regarding all meta-analyzable outcomes. These
outcomes included all-cause treatment discontinuation from early
intervention services or treatment as usual and at least 1
psychiatric hospitalization.
Meaning In early-phase psychosis, early intervention services
were associated with superior outcomes compared with
treatment as usual, which supports the need for funding and use
of early intervention services in patients with early-phase
psychosis.

 Outcome and Data Synthesis
The coprimary outcomes were all-cause treatment discon-
tinuation and at least 1 psychiatric hospitalization during the
treatment period (excluding a potential initial hospitalization
before the initiation of the EIS intervention). Treatment dis-
continuation is a commonly used outcome in psychiatric re-
search because it is a good indicator of treatment failure for
lackofefficacyortolerability,safety,oracceptability(withnon-
adherence being a major problem with psychiatric interven-
tions), while hospitalizations are an indicator of marked symp-
tom exacerbation or relapse, as well as of increased health care
costs. Therefore, these coprimary outcomes are good indica-
tors of real-life feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of
an intervention.
Key secondary outcomes were involvement in school or
work, total symptom severity improvement, and global func-
tioning(includingsocialandrolefunctioning).Theseareasrep-
resent the illness itself, as well as additional burden of the dis-
ease that leads to a poor long-term prognosis.
Additional outcomes included the following: the mean
number of psychiatric hospitalizations and bed-days during
treatment, study-defined relapse, remission (symptom stabil-
ityorminimumsymptomseverity)andrecovery(symptomsta-
bility or minimum severity plus improved social, educa-
tional,andvocationalattainment),symptomseverity(positive,
negative, general, and depressive symptoms26), and subjec-
tive quality of life. Details on outcome definitions and scales
are provided in eMethods 3 in the Supplement.
All eligible trials were assessed for methodological qual-
ity using the Cochrane Collaboration’
s tool for assessing risk
of bias.27 We extracted data on study design and patient, ill-
ness, and treatment components.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis28 of out-
comes for which at least 2 studies contributed data using
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 3 (http://www.meta-
analysis.com) (performed by B.G.). Intent-to-treat data were
usedwheneverpossible.Continuousoutcomeswereexpressed
as the standardized mean difference (SMD), which equals
Cohen d, preferring change scores (unless skewed, with the SD
exceeding twice the mean) over time point and end point
scores,whilecategoricaldatawereexpressedasthepooledrisk
ratio (RR) using the inverse variance method, each with their
95% CIs. Negative SMD favored EIS when smaller values are
better (psychopathology), and positive SMD favored EIS
when larger values are better (global functioning and quality
of life). Effect sizes of 0.2 were considered small, effect sizes
of 0.5 were considered medium, and effect sizes of 0.8 were
consideredlarge.29Riskratioslessthan1indicatethataspecific
adverse categorical outcome (all-cause discontinuation,
hospitalization, and relapse) occurred less frequently in EIS,
and RRs greater than 1 indicate that a desired categorical
outcome (remission, recovery, and involvement in school or
work) occurred more frequently in EIS. For categorical
outcomes, numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were calculated by
dividing 1 by the absolute risk difference. Numbers needed to
treat of 10 or less were considered clinically relevant.30 We
explored study heterogeneity using the χ2 test of homogeneity
and I2 statistics, with P < .05 and I2>50%, respectively,
indicating significant heterogeneity. All analyses were 2-tailed
with an α of .05.
In the primary analyses, EIS and TAU were compared at
study end point. We conducted subgroup and exploratory
maximum likelihood random-effects meta-regression
analyses of the coprimary outcomes and the 3 key second-
ary outcomes to identify potential moderators or mediators
(eMethods 4 in the Supplement). To allow comparability of
studies using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in the
meta-regression, we converted the baseline BPRS scores to
PANSS scores using an established method.31 Treatment
intensity was defined as the number of therapeutic inter-
ventions per month.
The following post hoc sensitivity analyses were added.
First, meta-regression analyses were performed to investi-
gate the potential influence of the overall attrition rate and be-
tween-group attrition difference on the coprimary outcomes
and the 3 key secondary outcomes (eMethods 5 in the Supple-
ment). Second, a subgroup analysis was performed that ex-
cluded 2 studies20,22 from Mexico because their effect sizes
were particularly large.
Finally, we inspected funnel plots. The regression test by
Egger et al32 and the trim-and-fill method by Duval and
Tweedie33 were used to examine the presence of publication
bias.
Results
Search
The initial search identified 8935 records, and study selec-
tion procedures yielded 41 articles and 1 book chapter
reporting on 10 meta-analyzable EIS trials (Figure 1 and
eTable 1 in the Supplement). All studies were published, but
unpublished data were obtained from all 10 studies to be
included in the meta-analysis. Study authors either shared
their original data set or reanalyzed the data as needed.
Across the 10 RCTs, the mean (SD) trial duration was 16.2
(7.4) months (range, 9-24 months). Among 2176 total
patients, the mean (SD) age was 27.5 (4.6) years, and 1355
(62.3%) were male.
Study, Patient, and Treatment Characteristics
Altogether, 10 studies9,18-22,34-37 (n = 2176 patients) were
included. Patients had a mean (SD) baseline PANSS-
converted BPRS score of 72.8 (11.7) (9 studies), a mean (SD)
total illness duration (defined as the interval between the
onset of positive psychotic symptoms and the study entry)
of 159.8 (125.4) weeks (6 studies), and a mean (SD) duration
of untreated psychosis (DUP) (defined as the interval
between the onset of positive psychotic symptoms and the
first antipsychotic treatment) of 79.9 (71.1) weeks (5 stud-
ies). All EIS programs were team-based, multicomponent
interventions, which included a mean (SD) of 4.8 (0.9) com-
ponents (range, 4-6 components). All EIS interventions

 included psychopharmacological treatment by a licensed
and qualified prescriber (with steady medication review and
monitoring) and family psychoeducation and counseling.
Other common components were cognitive behavior
therapy (7 studies), family therapy (7 studies), vocational
and educational counseling (5 studies), social skills training
(5 studies), and crisis response team and crisis management
(4 studies). Fidelity of EIS intervention was assessed in
all studies via treatment and team supervision. Rating
scales to measure fidelity were used in 6 studies, confirming
medium to high fidelity in the 3 studies that reported
measurement-based outcomes on the fidelity testing (more
details are listed in Table 1, eTable 2, and eTable 3 and in the
Supplement).
There was a 2-fold higher treatment intensity in EIS vs TAU
(4studies;ratioofEIStoTAU,2.14;range,1.36-3.00).Themean
(SD) number of low-risk ratings across the 7 domains of the
Cochrane Collaboration’
s tool for assessing risk of bias (higher
numbers are better) was 5.2 (0.9) (range, 4-7), indicating an
overall low risk of bias. Masking of participants and person-
nel was rated as high risk in all but 3 studies because knowl-
edge of the treatment received is almost inevitable with these
types of setting- and service-based interventions (eTable 4 and
eTable 5 in the Supplement).
All-Cause Treatment Discontinuation
All-cause treatment discontinuation was significantly lower
with EIS than with TAU (21.3% vs 31.3%) in 10 studies among
2173 patients (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61-0.80; P < .001; NNT, 12.4;
95% CI, 7.3-40.5; P = .005). The regression test by Egger et al32
did not indicate publication bias (Figure 2 and eFigure 1 and
eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Effect sizes did not differ statistically between any ana-
lyzed subgroups (eTable 6 in the Supplement). Higher base-
linePANSSnegativescoreswereassociatedwithevenlesstreat-
ment discontinuation in EIS (coefficient, −0.08; 95% CI, −0.15
to −0.01; P = .03).
At Least 1 Psychiatric Hospitalization
Riskofatleast1psychiatrichospitalizationin10studiesamong
2105 patients was significantly lower with EIS than TAU (32.3%
vs 42.4%) (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90; P = .003; NNT, 10.1;
95% CI, 6.4-23.9; P = .001). The regression test by Egger et al32
indicated potential publication bias. After statistical adjust-
ment for 5 potentially missing studies using the trim-and-fill
methodbyDuvalandTweedie,33theRRincreasedto0.87(95%
CI, 0.71-1.07) (Figure 2 and eFigure 3 and eFigure 4 in the
Supplement).
In subgroup analyses, a significant between-subgroup dif-
ference was only found regarding presence or absence of fi-
delitymonitoring.Studiesthatincludedfidelitymonitoringhad
comparatively fewer hospitalizations with EIS than with TAU
(RR,0.88vs0.50;P = .001).Inmeta-regressionanalyses,larger
study sample size was associated with lower hospitalization
risk(coefficient,0.001;95%CI,0.000-0.002;P = .002)(eTable
6 in the Supplement).
The number of psychiatric hospitalizations (mean [SD],
0.41 [0.30] for EIS and 0.59 [1.11] for TAU) and the number of
bed-days during treatment (mean [SD], 21.20 [48.94] for EIS
and 30.41 [61.05] for TAU) were significantly lower in EIS than
in TAU. The SMD for hospitalizations was −0.17 (95% CI, −0.31
to −0.03; P = .02), and the SMD for bed-days was −0.17 (95%
CI, −0.29 to −0.05; P = .006). These results are shown in eFig-
ure 5 and eFigure 6 in the Supplement.
Total and Specific Symptom Severity
Total symptom severity improvement in 8 studies among 1179
patientswassignificantlygreaterinEISthaninTAU(SMD,−0.32;
95% CI, −0.47 to −0.17; P < .001). Effect sizes did not differ sta-
tistically between any analyzed subgroups. However, in meta-
regression analyses of continuous variables, younger age, male
sex, higher baseline symptom severity (PANSS total, PANSS
negative, and PANSS positive), and percentage of patients with
schizophrenia were each associated with larger advantages for
EIS (Figure 2 and eTable 7 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
Superiority of EIS was supported by analysis of positive
symptom severity (SMD, −0.22; 95% CI, −0.32 to −0.11;
P < .001), negative symptom severity (SMD, −0.28; 95% CI,
−0.42 to −0.14; P < .001), general symptom severity (SMD,
−0.30; 95% CI, −0.47 to −0.13; P = .001), and depressive symp-
tom severity (SMD, −0.19; 95% CI, −0.35 to −0.03; P = .02).
These results are shown in Figure 2 and eFigures 8, 9, 10, and
11 in the Supplement.

Global functioning in 7 studies among 1005 patients im-
proved significantly more in EIS than in TAU (SMD, 0.21; 95%

or employed in 6 studies among 1743 patients was signifi-
cantly higher with EIS than with TAU (52.5% vs 45.3%) (RR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24; P = .01; NNT, 17.8; 95% CI, 9.8-100.0;

subgroup analysis. In the meta-regression analyses, no sig-
nificant moderators were identified (eTable 7 in the Supple-
ment).
Quality of Life
Quality of life in 4 studies among 505 patients was signifi-

Time Point Analyses
Superiority of EIS was consistent across almost all time points
(6, 9-12, and 18-24 months of treatment). The exceptions were
at 18 to 24 months for general symptom severity in 3 studies

 and for depressive symptom severity in 3 studies among 474
patients (SMD, −0.21; 95% CI, −0.51 to 0.08; P = .16) (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
In the post hoc meta-regression analysis, the overall attrition
rate and between-group attrition difference did not mediate
any of the outcomes (eTable 6 and eTable 7 in the Supple-
ment). The results of the post hoc subgroup analyses that
excluded the 2 studies from Mexico essentially confirmed the
findings of the entire available data set (eTable 8 in the Supple-
ment).
Discussion
In this comprehensive meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (n = 2176), 6
to 24 months of EIS that consisted of 4 to 6 evidence-based38
coordinated and integrated treatment components was asso-
ciated with superior outcomes compared with TAU regarding
all meta-analyzable outcomes. Our meta-analysis demon-
strates that EIS programs, all of which comprised antipsy-
chotic treatment and various psychosocial interventions, are
associated with significant superiority to TAU across a wide
range of clinically relevant outcomes, including hospitaliza-
tion risk, bed-days, symptoms, and global functioning. The
mean effect sizes were small for continuous outcomes, rang-
ing from an SMD of −0.19 for depression symptom severity (for
which patients were not selected) and an SMD of 0.21 for global
functioning to an SMD of −0.32 for total symptom severity. Ef-
fect sizes were small to medium for categorical outcomes. For
example, compared with TAU, participants in EIS had a 12.6%
greater likelihood of being in school or employed (NNT, 17.8)
and improved by 24% to 30% more than with TAU on other
outcomes, such as remission (NNT, 5.7), relapse prevention
(NNT, 10.0), hospitalization (NNT, 10.1), treatment engage-
ment (NNT, 12.4), and recovery (NNT, 13.9).
The I2 statistics describe the percentage of variation across
studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance, all of
which were less than 50% except for remission, for which I2
was68.9%,suggestinglowoutcomeheterogeneityacrossstud-
ies. However, the respective 95% CIs imply some relevant
heterogeneity of the treatment effect across the study popu-
lations, indicating that sources for this heterogeneity need to
be identified that could help detect patient subgroups requir-
ing a dynamic adaptation of EIS in terms of the intensity and
duration of individual or combined EIS components.
Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were explor-
atory owing to the small number of studies. However, the re-
sults indicated robust findings across various potential sources
of heterogeneity, such as study quality, observed case analy-
ses, and lack of masking.
In the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode–
Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) study,9 DUP less than
74 weeks (ie, the median) significantly increased effect sizes
for the primary outcome of subjective quality of life from 0.31
to 0.54 and for total symptoms from −0.29 to −0.42. In con-
trast, in our meta-regression analysis, DUP did not signifi-
cantly moderate the effectiveness of EIS. However, DUP data
(provided by only 5 trials) varied greatly (mean, 9-194 weeks;
median, 8-74 weeks). Only patient-level analyses can shed
more light on the effect of DUP on the efficacy of EIS.
Superior involvement in school or work and global func-
tioning were associated only with provision of vocational in-
terventionandfamilytherapy,respectively.Thesefindingssug-
gest that family involvement might independently improve
symptomatic and functional outcomes, whereas educational
or vocational rehabilitation succeeded in improving involve-
ment in school and work. Both of these results should be in-
vestigated further.
The consistent significant advantage of EIS at the end of
the intervention period in RCTs raises the question of gener-
alizability of the findings to patients not captured in RCTs and
of durability of the effects. Consistent with the treatment re-
sults in the meta-analyzed RCTs, the findings of a naturalis-
tic, 10-year follow-up study39 in Hong Kong using a matched
historical control (n = 296) suggested that 2 years of EIS sig-
nificantly reduced suicides and suicide attempts and re-
sulted in fewer admissions (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; P < .001),
shorter hospitalizations (OR, 1.29; P = .04), and longer em-
ployment tenure (OR, −0.28; P < .001). However, no differ-
ences emerged in psychotic symptoms, symptomatic remis-
sion, and functional recovery. In the German, naturalistic
Integrated Care in Early Psychosis study40 of EIS that in-
cluded an early detection program, EIS (n = 120) was associ-
ated with better outcomes than a historical control (n = 105)
at 1 year regarding remission, psychotic psychopathology, and
global functioning. Although these superior findings may be
driven by the addition of an early detection program, within
the treated cohort, DUP did not appear to be predictive of the
superior psychopathological and functional outcomes. How-
ever, as mentioned above, DUP was only reported in half of the
studies and had a very heterogeneous distribution (weighted
mean [SD], 79.9 [71.1] weeks), limiting the informative value
ofmeta-regressionanalyses.Nevertheless,theadditionofearly
detection elements as part of EIS that aim at reducing DUP
couldbeconsideredinfuturestudies.Moreover,studiesshould
alsoincludemoreminorstobetterrepresenttheclinicalsample
of patients with early-phase psychosis.
Targeting the question of whether an extended duration
of EIS would be superior to shorter intervention periods, an
uncontrolled EIS study41 reported that gains made at year 2
could be sustained or increased with EIS at a lower level for
another 3 years. Two studies that randomized patients after
2 years of EIS to either extended EIS by 3 years vs TAU
found beneficial effects at 5 years. The first study42 found
significant superiority of extended EIS for adherence, work
alliance, and patient satisfaction, while the treatment
effects remained stable in both groups. The second study43
found a significant effect of EIS on the treatment duration
and both positive and negative symptom remission. The
treatment duration and treatment intensity had an indepen-
dent effect on positive and negative symptoms and total
symptoms, respectively. Another RCT44 (n = 160) compar-
ing extended EIS vs step-down treatment (even more
intense than TAU) after 2 years of EIS indicated significant
superiority of the 12-month extended EIS for several out-

 comes, such as negative and depressive symptoms, general
psychopathology, global functioning, independent living
skills, and work productivity. However, the fact that, in this
study,44 only 20% of patients achieved functional recovery
(which included competitive employment) at year 3, as well
as that supported employment and educational interven-
tion outside of the context of EIS was successful in increas-
ing vocational or educational attainment in first-episode
psychosis,45,46 suggests the need for greater focus on func-
tional reintegration and employment or education.
Future research should focus on a better understanding
of the sources of heterogeneity in treatment response. The re-
search should seek to identify patient characteristics that de-
terminethemagnitudeofgainsoverallandfromindividualEIS
components, as well as their respective intensity and dura-
tion to achieve the targeted outcomes in the short term and
in the long term. To allow comparability of the effects, EIS
research studies and real-world programs should adhere to a
set of treatment standards, although adaptations of EIS based
oncountryandhealthcaresystemsmightbeneeded.19Toallow
meaningful comparisons of EIS across implementation sites
and systems that will likely vary in their ability to improve
different outcomes (probably reflecting their focus, priori-
ties, and resources), EIS initiatives should also be oriented to
a standard set of stakeholder-relevant outcomes (similar to the
National Institute of Mental Health Early Psychosis Inter-
vention Network47). In addition, information on the cost-
effectivenessofspecificEISpackagesacrossvariabletreatment
settings is needed.45,46
Given that schizophrenia is one of the disorders most as-
sociated with personal distress and societal cost,1 sustaining
gains achieved by EIS could be cost-effective.48 Therefore, ad-
ditional trials are needed that study different EIS extension vs
step-down procedures for patient subgroups that can move
between these options based on identified needs. Such re-
search is especially relevant because data from 3 programs
suggest that 2 to 3 years,49,50 5 years,49 7 to 8 years,51 or 10
years52 after the discontinuation of EIS, the prior gains may
largely be lost.
Limitations
Several limitations of this meta-analysis need to considered.
Although we included 10 studies and 2176 patients (6 trials and
1554 patients more than the prior meta-analysis10), the num-
bers of trials and participants were modest, limiting the infor-
mative value of analyses regarding possible publication bias
as well as subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Moreover,
patient and treatment characteristics were heterogeneous in
several dimensions, complicating the interpretation of inde-
pendent effects of specific moderators and mediators, includ-
ing the important variable of DUP, which is associated with the
prognosis of psychosis in general and which also signifi-
cantly moderated EIS outcomes.9,53 In addition, the results for
relapse, symptomatic remission, and recovery could be influ-
enced by heterogeneous outcome definitions, although the
same definitions were used for EIS and TAU in each indi-
vidual study.
Furthermore, although 3 studies did not use masked as-
sessors, this variable did not significantly moderate EIS supe-
riority. Moreover, the only outcome potentially related to the
variable of fidelity monitoring was a lower number of hospi-
talizations in EIS vs TAU in studies that reported fidelity moni-
toring outcomes.
Conversely, the TAU condition delivered by centers in-
volved in an RCT may have consisted of care that is better and
more comprehensive than real-world TAU, as indicated by the
number of treatment elements and treatment intensity in TAU.
If correct, this factor would have lowered effect sizes. Be-
cause the active treatment duration ranged from 6 to 24
months, we cannot comment on the efficacy of longer-term
EIS interventions. Furthermore, the observed effect sizes were
small to medium, and meta-analyzable cost-effectiveness data
across variable settings and health care systems were lack-
ing. Although each EIS program studied used 4 to 6 similar,
evidence-based intervention components, differences in the
choice and delivery of each component and in country-
specific and setting-specific TAU conditions could be rel-
evant. In addition, because each EIS program used 4 to 6 com-
ponents,itwasimpossibletoteaseaparttheeffectofindividual
combinations of EIS elements. Finally, adherence to each
of the treatments may have differed but was insufficiently
reported.
Conclusions
Based on the results from this comprehensive meta-analysis,
EISwasassociatedwithbetteroutcomesthanTAUacrossmany
sources of variability. These findings should provide further
impetus for the widespread implementation and funding of
EIS in the United States and across the world, as has already
begun.54-60
