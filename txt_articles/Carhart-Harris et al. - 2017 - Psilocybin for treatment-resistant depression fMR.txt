Psilocybin with psychological support is showing promise as a treatment model in psychiatry but its 
therapeutic mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygen-level 
dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) were measured with functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment with psilocybin (serotonin agonist) for treatment-
resistant depression (TRD). Quality pre and post treatment fMRI data were collected from 16 of 19 
patients. Decreased depressive symptoms were observed in all 19 patients at 1-week post-treatment and 
47% met criteria for response at 5 weeks. Whole-brain analyses revealed post-treatment decreases in 
CBF in the temporal cortex, including the amygdala. Decreased amygdala CBF correlated with reduced 
depressive symptoms. Focusing on a priori selected circuitry for RSFC analyses, increased RSFC was 
observed within the default-mode network (DMN) post-treatment. Increased ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex-bilateral inferior lateral parietal cortex RSFC was predictive of treatment response at 5-weeks, 
as was decreased parahippocampal-prefrontal cortex RSFC. These data fill an important knowledge 
gap regarding the post-treatment brain effects of psilocybin, and are the first in depressed patients. The 
post-treatment brain changes are different to previously observed acute effects of psilocybin and other 
‘psychedelics’ yet were related to clinical outcomes. A ‘reset’ therapeutic mechanism is proposed.
Psilocybin is the prodrug of psilocin (4-OH-dimethyltryptamine), a non-selective serotonin 2A receptor 
(5-HT2AR) agonist and classic ‘psychedelic’ drug1. Both compounds occur naturally in the ‘psilocybe’ genus 
of mushrooms, and are structurally related to the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin (5-OH-tryptamine, 
5-HT). Psilocybin has an ancient and more recent history of medicinal-use. Administered in a supportive envi-
ronment, with preparatory and integrative psychological care, it is used to facilitate emotional breakthrough 
and renewed perspective2. Accumulating evidence suggests that psilocybin with accompanying psychological 
support can be used safely to treat a range of psychiatric conditions1, including: end-of-life anxiety and depres-
sion3–5, alcohol and tobacco addiction6,7, obsessive compulsive disorder8, and most recently from our group, 
treatment-resistant major depression9. Findings from healthy volunteer studies10 and trials with other psyche-
delics11–13 supplement those from clinical studies showing that these drugs can have a rapid and lasting positive 
impact on mental health, often after just one or two doses. Such outcomes raise a number of important questions, 
including: what brain mechanisms mediate these effects?
Most human functional neuroimaging studies of psychedelics have focused on their acute effects with the aim 
of elucidating the neural correlates of the ‘psychedelic state’14,15. Consistent with findings from animal research16, 
psychedelics appear to dysregulate cortical activity14,17, producing an ‘entropic’ brain state18, characterised by 
compromised modular but enhanced global connectivity - referred to previously as network ‘disintegration’ and

‘desegregation’14. These effects have been found to correlate with important aspects of the ‘psychedelic expe-
rience’, including ‘ego-dissolution’14,17,19, and were predictive of post-acute changes in the personality domain 
‘openness’20. To our knowledge, only one other very recent study has investigated >12 hour post-acute effects of 
psychedelics on human brain function (although see12 and now21), and few have looked at anatomical changes 
possibly related to psychedelic use22,23.
The present study focused on changes in brain function before versus after psilocybin in patients with 
treatment-resistant depression who received two doses of the drug (10 mg followed by 25 mg, one-week apart) 
as part of an open-label clinical trial. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) 
resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), were used to measure changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and 
functional connectivity before (baseline) and one-day after treatment with psilocybin (i.e. one day after the 25 mg 
dose). It has been suggested that the days subsequent to a psychedelic experience constitute a distinct phase, 
referred to as the ‘after-glow’
, that is characterised by mood improvements and stress relief24. The rationale for 
scanning one-day post-treatment was to capture brain changes related to this so-called after-glow that might 
correlate with current mood improvements and/or longer-term prognoses. We predicted that resting-state CBF 
and FC would be altered post treatment and correlate with immediate and longer-term clinical improvements.
With regards to ‘longer-term’ clinical outcomes, we chose to focus on a 5-week post-treatment endpoint due 
to a virtual 50:50 split between responders and non-responders at this time-point (QIDS-SR16) and that none of 
the patients went on to additional (and thus, confounding) treatments within this time frame. A select number 
of regions of interest were chosen a priori for CBF and RSFC analyses due to previous work implicating their 
involvement in depression and its treatment, e.g25–27.
Results
Nineteen patients with diagnoses of treatment resistant major depression completed pre-treatment and one-day 
post-treatment fMRI scanning. Excessive movement or other artefact meant that three patients were removed 
from the ASL analyses and four from the RSFC (SI Appendix), leaving sample sizes of 16 (mean age = 42.8 ± 
10.1 y, 4 females) and 15 (mean age = 42.8 ± 10.5 y, 4 females) for the ASL and BOLD analyses, respectively.
Treatment with psilocybin produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. For the patients included 
in the ASL analysis (minus one patient whose scan 1 rating was not collected), the mean depression score 
(QIDS-SR16) for the week prior to the pre-treatment scan was 16.9 ± 5.1, and for the day of the post-treatment 
scan, it was 8.8 ± 6.2 (change = −
8.1 ± 6, t = −
5.2, p < 0.001). The mean QIDS-SR16 score at baseline (screen-
ing) was 18.9 ± 3, and for 5-weeks post-treatment, it was 10.9 ± 4.8 (change = −
8 ± 5.1, t = −
6.3, p < 0.001). 
Mean change values for those included in the BOLD analyses were −
7.3 ± 5.3 (change from scan 1 to scan 2) and 
−
8.2 ± 5.2 (change from baseline to 5 weeks post-treatment). Both contrasts were highly significant (t = −
5.2 and 
−
6.2, p < 0.001). Six of the 15 (BOLD) and 16 (ASL) patients met criteria for treatment response (≤
50% reduc-
tions in QIDS-SR16 score) at 5 weeks. Of the full 19 patients, all showed some decrease in depressive symptoms 
at 1 week, with 12 meeting criteria for response (change = −
10.2 ± 5.3, t = −
6.4, p < 0.001). All but one patient 
showed some decrease in QIDS-SR16 score at week 5 (with one showing no change) and 47% met criteria for 
response (change = −
9.2 ± 5.6, t = −
6.7, p < 0.001).
Whole-brain CBF was calculated pre and post treatment and contrasted (Fig. 1). Only decreases in CBF were 
observed post treatment (vs pre), and these reached statistical significance in the left Heschl’s gyrus, left precentral 
gyrus, left planum temporale, left superior temporal gyrus, left amygdala, right supramarginal gyrus and right 
parietal operculum (Table S1). Based on previous findings of increased amygdala blood flow and metabolism in 
depression25, reductions in amygdala CBF were compared with the reductions in depressive symptoms between 
scan 1 and 2 (i.e. decreased depressed mood at the time of scanning), and a significant relationship was found 
(r = 0.59; p = 0.01). After splitting the sample into responders and non-responders at 5-weeks post-treatment, and 
then comparing CBF changes in a t-test, no significant difference was found (t = 0.11; p = 0.46).
Next, seed-based RSFC analyses were performed using the BOLD data. Based on previous data implicating 
their involvement in the pathophysiology of depression and response to treatments25–27, four regions of interest 
(ROIs) were chosen: 1) the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), 2) the ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
(vmPFC), 3) the bilateral amygdala, and 4) the bilateral parahippocampus (PH) (Figs 2–4 and SI Appendix, 
Table S1).
Increased sgACC RSFC was observed with the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneous (PCC) post-treatment 
(Fig. 2) but this effect did not correlate with reductions in depressive symptoms between scan 1 and 2 (r = −
0.2; 
p = 0.24) and nor did it predict treatment response at 5 weeks (t = −
1.3; p = 0.11).
Increased vmPFC RSFC was observed with the bilateral inferior-lateral parietal cortex (ilPC) post-treatment. 
This effect did not correlate with reductions in depressive symptoms between scan 1 and 2 (r = −
0.26; p = 0.17) 
but did predict treatment response at 5 weeks, with responders showing significantly greater vmPFC-ilPC RSFC 
increases than non-responders (t = 2.1; p = 0.03).
Decreased PH RSFC was observed with a PFC cluster incorporating the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. 
This effect did not correlate with reductions in depressive symptoms between scan 1 and 2 (r = 0.08; p = 0.38) 
but did relate to treatment response at 5 weeks, with responders showing significantly greater PH-PFC RSFC 
decreases than non-responders (t = −
1.9, p = 0.04). Amygdala RSFC was not significantly altered post treatment.
Analyses of within network RSFC using 12 previously identified canonical RSNs14 revealed increased 
default-mode network (DMN) (t = 2.7, p = 0.018), dorsal attention network (DAN) (t = 2.2, p = 0.042), and 
posterior opercular network (POP) (t = 2.7, p = 0.016) RSFC post-treatment; however, these changes failed to 
survive Bonferonni correction for multiple comparisons (revised α
 = 0.05/11 = 0.0042) and did not correlate 
with depression outcomes, e.g. the relationship between change in DMN RSFC and reduced QIDS-SR16 scores 
between scan 1 and 2 were non-significant (r = 0.25; p = 0.18) and neither were changes in DMN RSFC predictive 
of outcomes at 5 weeks (t = 0.58; p = 0.28). Analyses of between network RSFC using the same 12 RSNs, revealed

decreased RSFC between the DMN and right frontoparietal network (rFP) (t = −
3.6, p = 0.0031) and increased 
RSFC between the sensorimotor network (SM) and rFP (t = 2.2, p = 0.045) (Fig. 5); however, these effects did not 
survive FDR correction for multiple comparisons and did not relate to reduced QID-16 scores between scan 1 
and 2, nor response at 5 weeks.
Lastly, based on indications from previous work4,5,10 we explored the possibility that the quality of the acute 
‘psychedelic’ experience may have mediated the post-acute brain changes. We focused on a rating scale factor 
related to ‘peak’ or ‘mystical’ experience and used scores for the high-dose psilocybin session as a covariate in a

PH RSFC analysis. The PH was specifically chosen due to previous work implicating its involvement in related 
states14. Results revealed that patients scoring highest on ‘peak’ or ‘mystical’ experience had the greatest decreases 
in PH RSFC in limbic (e.g. bilateral amygdala) and DMN-related cortical regions (e.g. the PCC). See the supple-
mentary file for the relevant maps and discussion.
Discussion
The present study goes some way to addressing an important knowledge gap concerning the post-acute brain 
effects of serotonergic psychedelics. Its findings suggest that changes in brain activity observed just one-day after a 
high dose psychedelic experience are very different to those found during the acute psychedelic state. Specifically, 
whereas the acute psychedelic state in healthy volunteers is characterised by modular disintegration14,15,28 and 
global integration14,19,29, there are trends towards modular (re)integration and minimal effects on global integra-
tion/segregation post psilocybin for depression. Relating the blood flow findings to what has been seen previously 
in the acute psychedelic state is somewhat more complicated due to inconsistencies in this literature – likely due 
to analysis approaches and interpretation14,15,30: Here we saw decreased CBF bilaterally in the temporal lobes, 
including the left amygdala one-day post treatment. Decreased absolute CBF in subcortical and high-level asso-
ciation cortices have been previously reported with intravenous (I.V.)15 and now oral psilocybin30 but increased 
CBF and metabolism have also been reported with I.V. LSD14, oral psilocybin31, and oral ayahuasca32.
Much recent research has focused on the involvement of the default-mode network in psychiatric disor-
ders33, and particularly depression34,35. We previously observed decreased DMN functional integrity under psil-
ocybin15 and LSD14, and others have with ayahuasca28. Here however, increased DMN integrity was observed 
one-day post treatment with psilocybin, both via seed (i.e. vmPFC and sgACC) and network-based approaches. 
Previous work has suggested that increased DMN integrity may be a marker of depressed mood and specifi-
cally, depressive rumination34,36. On this basis, increased DMN integrity post psilocybin may be surprising. The 
post-treatment increases in within-DMN RSFC and sgACC-PCC RSFC did not relate to symptom improvements 
but vmPFC-ilPC RSFC did (see Fig. 3). This apparent divergence from previous findings36,37 is intriguing, and 
deserves further discussion (below).
It should be noted that findings of elevated within-DMN RSFC in depression are not entirely consistent in 
the literature38–41. For example, using a DMN-focused analysis, precuneus-DMN RSFC39 was found to be lower 
in patients than in healthy controls, and normalised after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - and 
only in responders39 – consistent with the present findings. Lower precuneus-DMN RSFC in depression was also 
seen in a separate study and the degree of this abnormality correlated with autobiographical memory deficits40. 
In another study, lower PCC-dmPFC and PCC-ilPC RSFC were seen in first-episode depressed patients relative

to healthy controls41. In the present study, we saw increased within-DMN RSFC post treatment with psilocybin, 
and increased vmPFC-bilateral ilPC RSFC was predictive of treatment response at 5 weeks (Fig. 3). These findings 
suggest a commonality in the antidepressant action of ECT and psilocybin39 in which DMN integrity is decreased 
acutely (at least by the latter14,15,28) and increased (or normalised) post-acutely, accompanied by improvements 
in mood. This process might be likened to a ‘reset’ mechanism in which acute modular disintegration (e.g. in the 
DMN) enables a subsequent re-integration and resumption of normal functioning.
Recent meta-analyses of studies of resting-state CBF in depression have yielded relatively mixed results34,42, 
although findings of increased thalamic34,42 and sgACC metabolism are relatively consistent34. Here, we did not 
find any post-treatment changes in thalamic or sgACC CBF with psilocybin, either in whole-brain or ROI-based

analyses. We did observe decreased CBF bilaterally in the temporal cortex however, including the left medial tem-
poral lobe and specifically, the left amygdala. Given previous findings of elevated resting-state amygdala CBF and 
metabolism in mood disorders25,43,44, the reduction in amygdala CBF observed here, and its relation to symptom 
severity, could be viewed as a possible remediation effect. Moreover, generalised decreases in CBF are (again) con-
sistent with what has been previously reported with ECT45, i.e. most studies have documented an increase in CBF 
in the acute ‘ictal’ state, including in the amygdala45; however, the post-ictal period is characterised by decreased 
CBF, and often in those regions that were most perfused during seizure45. Acutely increased CBF has previously 
been reported with ayahuasca32 and LSD15 and increased glucose metabolism has been observed in the acute

state with oral31 but not I.V. psilocybin15. Thus, a post-acute reversal of acute increases in CBF could be seen as 
consistent with the post-treatment ‘reset’ mechanism proposed above – although recent work has laid into ques-
tion whether oral psilocybin does indeed cause increases in brain absolute CBF30. It would be challenging (but 
not impossible) to carry out acute and post-acute imaging in future trials of psilocybin for depression, and this 
may be necessary if the ‘reset’ model is to be properly tested. In such a study, we would advise focusing on BOLD 
RSFC (and perhaps simultaneous EEG-related measures) rather than CBF, due to RSFC and EEG offering more 
direct and reliable indices of brain activity and function than more difficult to interpret measures such as CBF. 
The inclusion of a healthy control group, exposed to a consistent treatment procedure, would further strengthen 
the design of such a study, as would the inclusion of a placebo and/or active comparator arm.
The present study’s other major positive finding was a decrease in RSFC between the bilateral parahippocam-
pus and the PFC, an effect that (like increased vmPFC-ilPC RSFC) was predictive of treatment response at 5 
weeks. Curiously, a post-hoc exploratory analysis suggested that acute ‘peak’ or ‘mystical-type’ experiences under 
psilocybin may mediate the post-acute changes in parahippocampal RSFC (including decreased PH-PCC RSFC). 
Focusing on parahippocampal-PFC RSFC, this has generally been found to be elevated in depression46, and con-
sistently so across the duration of a resting-state scan47. Prefrontal-limbic circuitry has been linked with top-down 
suppression of affective responsiveness48 and lower resting-state amygdala-vmPFC RSFC in combination with 
amygdala hyperfusion was found to relate to state-anxiety in healthy individuals43, corroborating separate find-
ings49. Seven days of citalopram has been found to reduce amygdala-vmPFC50 and dorso-medial PFC-left hip-
pocampal RSFC51 in healthy volunteers, somewhat consistent with the present findings.
In conclusion, here we document for the first time, changes in resting-state brain blood flow and functional 
connectivity post-treatment with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Decreased blood flow was found 
to correlate (in the amygdala) with reductions in depressive mood. Increased within-DMN RSFC was observed 
post-treatment, using both seed and network-based analyses, and specific increases in RSFC between the vmPFC 
and bilateral ilPC nodes of the DMN were greatest in individuals who maintained treatment-response at 5 weeks. 
Finally, decreased PH-PFC RSFC was observed post-treatment and this was also predictive of treatment-response 
at 5 weeks. An exploratory post-hoc analysis revealed that acute ‘peak’ or ‘mystical’ experience during the 
high-dose psilocybin session was predictive of these changes in PH RSFC.
This study is limited by its small sample size and absence of a control condition. Moreover, correction for 
multiple testing was applied to the full RSN but not the specific (hypothesis-based) ROI analyses. Future research 
with more rigorous controls should serve to challenge and develop the present study’s findings and inferences. 
Assessing the relative contributions of, and potential interactions between, the different treatment factors (e.g. the 
drug and the accompanying psychological support) may be a particularly informative next step.

Imaging vs clinical outcomes. 
To explore relationships between significant imaging outcomes and the 
main clinical outcomes, we chose to focus on changes in depressive symptoms from: 1) pre-Treatment to scan 
2 (i.e. one-day post-treatment), and 2) pre-Treatment to 5 weeks post-Treatment. The primary clinical outcome 
measure, the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR16) was chosen for this purpose. 
Relationships between imaging outcomes and contemporaneous decreases in depressive symptoms were calcu-
lated using a standard Pearson’s r, and relationships with the longer-term (i.e. at 5 weeks post-treatment) changes 
in depressive symptoms were calculated by splitting the sample into responders (>50% reduction in QIDS-SR16 
scores) and non-responders at this time-point, and then performing a one-tailed t-test on the relevant imaging 
outcomes (one-tailed as directionality was unequivocally implied by the direction of the significant imaging out-
come). We used a revised version of the QIDS-SR16 for 24-hour measurement for the post-treatment scan in 
order to get a contemporaneous, state-related index of depressive symptoms at this time-point.
Anatomical Scans. 
Imaging was performed on a 3 T Siemens Tim Trio using a 12-channel head coil 
at Imanova, London, UK. Anatomical images were acquired using the ADNI-GO (Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative, Grand Opportunity52) recommended MPRAGE parameters (1 mm isotropic vox-
els, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, 160 sagittal slices, 256 ×
 256 in-plane FOV, flip angle = 9 degrees, band-
width = 240 Hz/pixel, GRAPPA acceleration = 2).
BOLD fMRI Resting State Acquisition. 
T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPI) were acquired for the 
functional scan using 3 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 31 ms, 36 axial slices, 192 mm in-plane FOV, 
flip angle = 80 degree, bandwidth = 2298 Hz/pixel, GRAPPA acceleration = 2, number of volumes = 240, 8 min.
BOLD Pre-processing. 
Four different but complementary imaging software packages were used to analyse 
the fMRI data. Specifically, FMRIB Software Library (FSL)53, AFNI54, Freesurfer55 and Advanced Normalization 
Tools (ANTS)56 were used. Fifteen subjects were used for this analysis: one subject was discarded from the 
analysis due to an injury in parietal cortex and three subjects were discarded due to high levels of head move-
ment. Principally, motion was measured using frame-wise displacement (FD)57. The criterion for exclusion was 
subjects with >20% scrubbed volumes with a scrubbing threshold of FD = 0.5. For the 15 subjects that were 
used in the analysis, there was no significant difference in the mean FD (meanFDbefore = 0.179 ± 0.088, mean-
FDafter = 0.158 ± 0.084, p = 0.23). The mean percentage of scrubbed volumes for before and after treatment was 
4.6 ± 5% and 3.5 ± 5.2%, respectively (p = 0.56). The maximum of scrubbed volumes for before and after treat-
ment was 17.3% and 17.7%, respectively. The following pre-processing stages were performed: 1) removal of the 
first three volumes; 2) de-spiking (3dDespike, AFNI); 3) slice time correction (3dTshift, AFNI); 4) motion cor-
rection (3dvolreg, AFNI) by registering each volume to the volume most similar, in the least squares sense, to all 
others (in-house code); 5) brain extraction (BET, FSL); 6) rigid body registration to anatomical scans (BBR, FSL); 
7) non-linear registration to 2 mm MNI brain (Symmetric Normalization (SyN), ANTS); 8) scrubbing58 - using 
an FD threshold of 0.5, scrubbed volumes were replaced with the mean of the surrounding volumes. 9) spatial 
smoothing (FWHM) of 6 mm (3dBlurInMask, AFNI); 10) band-pass filtering between 0.01 to 0.08 Hz (3dFou-
rier, AFNI); 11) linear and quadratic de-trending (3dDetrend, AFNI); 12) regressing out 9 nuisance regressors 
(all nuisance regressors were band-pass filtered with the same band-pass filter as above): out of these, 6 were 
motion-related (3 translations, 3 rotations) and 3 were anatomically-related (not smoothed). Specifically, the ana-
tomical nuisance regressors were: 1) ventricles (Freesurfer, eroded in 2 mm space), 2) draining veins (DV) (FSL’s 
CSF minus Freesurfer’s Ventricles, eroded in 1 mm space) and 3) local white matter (WM) (FSL’s WM minus 
Freesurfer’s subcortical grey matter (GM) structures, eroded in 2 mm space). Regarding local WM regression, 
AFNI’s 3dLocalstat was used to calculate the mean local WM time-series for each voxel, using a 25 mm radius 
sphere centred on each voxel59.
Seed-based RSFC. 
Based on prior hypotheses, 4 seeds were chosen for these analyses: 1) the bilateral PH, 
vmPFC, sgACC and bilateral amygdala. The PH seed was constructed by combining the anterior and poste-
rior parahippocampal gyrus from the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas, which was then thresholded at 50%. 
The vmPFC seed was the same as one previously used by our team in analyses of the acute effects of LSD60, 
psilocybin61 and MDMA62. The sgACC seed was a 5 mm sphere centred at ±2 28 -5 (MNI_152 coordinates) 
based on63. Bilateral amygdala seed was based on Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas, threshold at 50%. Mean 
time-series were derived for these seeds for each RS scan. RSFC analyses were performed using FSL’s FEAT for 
each subject. Pre-whitening (FILM) was applied. A higher level analysis was performed to compare pre-treatment 
and post-treatment conditions using a mixed-effects GLM (FLAME 1 + 2), cluster corrected (z > 2.3, p < 0.05). 
MRIcron was used to display the results.
Resting State Networks (RSN). 
RSNs were derived using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) per-
formed on data acquired separately as part of the Human Connectome Project (HCP)64. This procedure is identi-
cal to one used previously with LSD60. Briefly, 20 independent components (ICs) were derived, of which the same 
12 functionally meaningful RSNs were identified, namely: medial visual network (VisM), lateral visual network 
(VisL), occipital pole network (VisO), auditory network (AUD), sensorimotor network (SM), default-mode net-
work (DMN), parietal cortex network (PAR), dorsal attention network (DAN), salience network (SAL), posterior 
opercular network (POP), left fronto-parietal network (lFP) and right fronto-parietal network (rFP).
Integrity (within-RSN RSFC). 
Network integrity was calculated for each RSN for both pre-treatment and 
post-treatment. All 20 HCP ICA components were entered into FSL’s dual regression analysis65. The first step of 
the dual regression used the components as regressors applied to the 4D BOLD datasets for each subject, resulting 
in a matrix of time-series for each ICA. The second step involved regressing these time-series into the same 4D

scan data to get a subject-specific set of spatial maps (parameter estimate (PE) images). For each subject and for 
each condition, within each of the 12 RSNs of interest (threshold = 3), the mean PE across voxels was calculated. 
This mean PE represents the integrity value. Subsequently, paired t-tests were used to calculate the difference in 
integrity between conditions for each RSN (Bonferroni corrected for 11 RSNs, with no correction for DMN as we 
had a prior hypothesis).
Segregation (between-RSN RSFC). 
Between-RSN RSFC was calculated in a similar manner to previ-
ous analyses involving acute LSD60 and psilocybin66. Specifically, a 12 ×
 12 matrix was constructed representing 
RSFC between different RSN pairs. For each subject and for each condition, the time-series for the relevant pair 
of RSNs, was entered into a GLM, resulting in a PE value representing the strength of functional connectivity 
between them. GLM was used rather than correlation coefficients because differences between Pearson’s corre-
lations could be a result of either signal or noise differences; therefore, it is preferable to perform regression and 
look for pre-treatment and post-treatment differences on the PE67. The GLM was estimated twice: 1) each RSN as 
a dependant variable in one model, and 2) each RSN as an independent variable in the second model. These two 
PE values were then averaged together, to generate a symmetric 12 ×
 12 matrix (Fig. 4b). Three 12 ×
 12 matrices 
were created as follows: 1) the group mean PE values for pre-Treatment treatment, 2) the group mean PE values 
for post-Treatment treatment, and 3) paired t-test to compare the PE values for the two conditions, pre-Treatment 
and post-Treatment treatment (two-tailed, 5000 permutations).
