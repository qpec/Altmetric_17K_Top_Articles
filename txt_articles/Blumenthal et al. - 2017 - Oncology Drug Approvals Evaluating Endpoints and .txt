In the past few decades, with improved understanding of the
genomic and immunologic underpinnings of cancer, better
molecular characterization of tumors, and more precisely tar-
geted agents, new and innovative therapeutics have altered
the natural histories of certain cancer types such as chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma, and melanoma.
Recognizing a need to further expedite development of drugs
that show promising early clinical evidence of benefit over
available therapy, the U.S. Congress, in 2012, established the
Breakthrough Therapy Designation program [1]. The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) uses this program frequently for
transformative therapies that show great promise in early clini-
cal trials [2]. Table 1 provides examples of new FDA-approved
therapies that were developed based on the improved under-
standing of tumor biology and that markedly changed the ther-
apeutic landscape of certain cancer types. Figure 1 highlights
certain cancer types where 5-year survival has improved in
recent decades, which is at least partially attributed to better
therapeutic options.
With the Breakthrough Therapy Designation program add-
ing to the tools that the FDA has for expediting drug develop-
ment, the FDA reassessed the endpoints needed for approval
of transformative therapies. Although the demonstration of an
improvement in overall survival remains the gold standard for
drug approval, innovation in cancer research has led to use of
other endpoints in regulatory decision-making.These endpoints
include substantially delaying tumor progression or extending
progression-free survival, substantially reducing tumor size for
a prolonged time, improving objective response rate and dura-
tion of response, or improving cancer-related symptoms and
patient function.
ONCOLOGY ENDPOINTS: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
In the 1970s, the FDA usually approved drugs on the basis of
objective response rate [3]. Combinations of cytotoxic chemo-
therapy produced durable and deep responses and cures for
patients with malignancies such as metastatic testicular cancer,
Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [4–6].
In other tumor types, the benefits of cytotoxic chemotherapy
were incremental, and in certain settings the risks of these
agents outweighed the benefits. In the 1980s, after discussions
with the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC), the
FDA determined that drug approval should be primarily based
on improvements in overall survival. This was, in part, due to
the benefit-risk evaluation of many cytotoxic agents with mod-
est efficacy and marked toxicity.
With the introduction into clinical practice of targeted
therapies and, more recently, immunotherapies, the benefit-
risk evaluation of novel agents required a reassessment. Imati-
nib was approved for CML based on cytogenetic response rate,
with subsequent trials showing a clear advantage over inter-
feron and cytarabine, not only with respect to efficacy, but also
safety [7, 8]. Due to high rates of cross-over of patients initially
allocated to interferon and cytarabine to imatinib, and the long
survival of patients on both arms treated with the abl inhibitor,
more than 10 years of follow-up was required to provide a nom-
inally (but not statistically) significant improvement in overall
survival [9]. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), crizotinib was
approved for patients whose tumors harbor ALK rearrange-
ments based on unprecedented response rates demonstrated
in single-arm trials, with a more favorable tolerability profile
compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in subsequent
randomized controlled trials [10, 11].
Over the past decade, through numerous discussions about
endpoints in several tumor types with external stakeholders,
including oncology professional societies, patient advocacy
groups, and ODAC, the FDA received advice to re-evaluate
approval endpoints. Endpoints including objective response
rate of sufficient duration and progression-free survival can be
clinically relevant and meaningful to patients and treating
oncologists, and may be acceptable for either accelerated or
regular approval, depending on the circumstance [12–25].
The FDA has acknowledged that substantially delaying
tumor progression or significantly reducing tumor size can be
beneficial to patients if the overall benefit-risk profile is favor-
able [26]. Through numerous interactions with drug sponsors
throughout the drug development process, the FDA has
worked with sponsors to tailor drug development programs to
the unique context of the patient population and disease under
study. For breakthrough therapies, the interactions between
the FDA and sponsors are even more extensive. This has led to
approvals of drugs that have provided meaningful treatments

ing patients with renal cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma,
medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GIST), metastatic basal cell carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendo-
crine tumor, multiple myeloma, CML, chronic lymphocytic leu-
kemia (CLL), and EGFR- and ALK-driven NSCLC, to name a few.
Table 2 lists examples of therapies that were approved on end-
points other than overall survival in their registration trials, but

OVERALL SURVIVAL ENDPOINT: LIMITATIONS
An improvement in overall survival may be impractical or
unreasonable to demonstrate in randomized controlled trials in
selected disease areas. Unlike other therapeutic areas where
placebo-controlled trials can provide a comparator for the
demonstration of overall survival, the use of placebo-controlled
trials is limited in life-threatening diseases, especially for novel
drugs demonstrating improved biologic activity in early drug
development. For drugs demonstrating unprecedented activity
in early clinical development in cancers with few effective
options, the ability to randomly allocate patients to either an
agent with markedly improved durable response rates or to a
toxic and marginally effective comparator may not be feasible
because equipoise may not exist [27, 28]. If a randomized trial
is conducted, many investigators and patients request a cross-
over to the investigational arm. Cross-over may confound the
demonstration of improvement in overall survival and require
that the trial have an alternate endpoint. As was observed in
trials randomizing patients with EGFR-mutant or ALK rear-
ranged advanced NSCLC to either targeted therapy or chemo-
therapy, high cross-over to the experimental arm confounded
the interpretation of overall survival [29–32]. The use of alter-
native endpoints, such as progression-free survival, provides a
clinically relevant endpoint and allows expeditious access of
important drugs to patients.
A demonstration of improvement in overall survival may
not be practical in cancers with long natural histories. In part
due to improved systemic treatments, patients with advanced
cancers such as CLL, MTC, multiple myeloma, and CML now
have 5-year survivals upwards of 50% [33]. In these diseases,
the time required and large patient numbers needed to power
a trial to detect a survival improvement would not be practical
and could deny effective treatment to patients, which would
also negatively impact innovation.

 As cancers are re-classified by their underlying genomic
properties, subsets of even common cancers such as NSCLC are
classified as orphan diseases. For example, ROS1 rearrange-
ments occur in approximately 1% of patients with advanced
NSCLC, approximately 2,000 U.S. patients yearly. Even if ROS1
screening occurred in all patients, a randomized clinical trial
powered to detect a survival difference may be challenging to
conduct and complete. These three features—high activity in
early clinical development compromising the equipoise of a
randomized controlled trial, the long natural history of certain
cancers, and the rarity of a cancer due to enhanced re-
classification based on genomic factors—may limit the use of
overall survival as a registration endpoint and requires a re-
evaluation of other endpoints.
HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE METRICS: LIMITATIONS
In addition to overall survival, many trials assess patient-
reported outcome (PRO) measurements of a patient’s health-
related quality of life (HRQL), physical functioning, or tumor-
related symptoms. Health-related quality of life is important to

Evaluating Endpoints in Breakthrough Therapies

Downloaded from 
 patients, but is challenging to assess, and has components
(e.g., social and emotional well-being) that can be affected by
life circumstances outside of a drug’s effect. These concerns,
coupled with methodological challenges, open-label and single
arm trial designs, and a lack of standard analytic methods, have
limited the use of HRQL as a statistically tested efficacy end-
point in cancer clinical trials.
Because HRQL is a broad and multi-dimensional endpoint,
it may be less responsive to a drug’s effect. Concentrating PRO
analyses on key disease symptoms, treatment side effects, and
physical function may provide more sensitive measurement of
how a patient experiences a cancer therapy. While rarely used
as a primary efficacy endpoint, measurement of patient-
reported symptoms and function can complement radio-
graphic, molecular, and survival endpoints. For example, the
approval of ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis was based on reduction
in spleen size and improvement of myelofibrosis symptoms
using a PRO instrument, the modified myelofibrosis symptom
assessment form version 2.0 [34]. Exploration of the tolerability
of a cancer therapy through longitudinal PRO assessment of
symptomatic side effects and their impact on the patient is also
of interest. New technologies such as wearable devices may
also provide important data on a patient’s function in daily life.
The FDA continues to actively investigate novel and existing
PRO tools, methodologies, and other clinical outcome assess-
ments to rigorously assess the patient experience, and consider
these outcomes in benefit-risk assessments [35].
SEQUENCING THERAPIES TO TRANSFORM THE NATURAL
HISTORY OF A MALIGNANCY
Drugs approved on endpoints other than overall survival have
provided clinically meaningful treatments to many patients. In
CML, approval of the abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors based on
biomarker changes, such as major molecular response, has
transformed this once-fatal disease to a chronic disease, with
patients now having a life expectancy approaching that of the
general population [36]. In multiple myeloma, approval of drugs
such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, anti-
CD38 antibodies, and anti-SLAMF7 antibodies based on end-
points of progression-free survival and objective response rate
has altered the disease’s natural history and markedly improved
10-year survival [37, 38]. In advanced colorectal cancer, sequen-
tial therapeutic gains with fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan- and
oxaliplatin-based regimens, along with monoclonal antibodies
targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and EGFR,
have contributed to a doubling of expected survival exceeding
2 years [39, 40].
Approval of RET inhibitors for MTC, kit inhibitors for GIST,
hedgehog inhibitors for advanced basal cell carcinoma, anti-
interleukin-6 for multicentric Castleman’s disease, and anti-
programmed death-ligand 1 for Merkel cell carcinoma have
provided therapeutic options in diseases where there were no
approved drugs. These drugs were approved on either
progression-free survival or objective response rate because of
the limitations of using overall survival as described above.
EVOLUTION OF THE BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT WITH
IMPROVED SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF CANCER
Although the vast majority of agents that are approved under
expedited programs such as accelerated approval subsequently
confirm benefit and receive regular approval, there are infre-
quent examples of drugs granted accelerated approval on the
basis of non-survival endpoints such as objective response rate
or progression-free survival that required withdrawal (either
voluntary or involuntary) from the market [41–43]. These
include bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer, gefitinib for
“all-comer” (not selected by EGFR mutation status) refractory
NSCLC, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin for acute myeloid leuke-
mia. There are also infrequent cases of drugs granted regular
approval based on an overall survival endpoint that require
modification of the indicated population as understanding of
science evolves.
The development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefiti-
nib and erlotinib for refractory NSCLC is illustrative. In 2003,
gefitinib was granted accelerated approval in an “all-comer”
patient population based on objective response rate, but was
withdrawn from the market after several post-marketing stud-
ies failed to confirm clinical benefit. In 2004, erlotinib was
granted regular approval based on an incremental improve-
ment in overall survival over placebo in an “all-comer” refrac-
tory patient population. Improved knowledge of the underlying
biology of cancer led to an understanding that the patients
who benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors were those
whose tumors harbored sensitizing kinase domain mutations in
the EGFR gene.This led to the approval of erlotinib in 2013 and
gefitinib in 2015 for patients whose NSCLC tumors harbor EGFR
exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations
based on endpoints of objective response rate and progres-
sion-free survival [44, 45]. In 2016, the erlotinib indication was
modified to remove the indication for patients with EGFR "wild
type" NSCLC based on a study that did not demonstrate erloti-
nib’s benefit over placebo in patients whose tumors lacked sen-
sitizing EGFR mutations [46].
REALWORLD EVIDENCE: A CONTINUUM OF DRUG
DEVELOPMENT
Given that more agents will likely be approved earlier in the
cycle of evidence generation (such as in expansion cohorts of
phase I trials) “real world evidence” may provide a better
understanding of chronic safety and long-term efficacy of
oncology drugs used in the clinic [47, 48]. This evidence can be
generated from multiple sources, including electronic health
records, patient registries, mobile health applications, and
social media [49]. Real world evidence may enhance the gener-
alizability of clinical trial results to patient populations not stud-
ied in registration trials, and should improve the understanding
of dosing and safety issues encountered in clinical practice.
Real world evidence could be generated through pragmatic
randomized clinical trials conducted at the point of care in com-
munity settings where traditional clinical trials are infrequently
conducted. As the methodologies develop, continued discus-
sion will be needed regarding optimal endpoints to assess effi-
cacy in these pragmatic trials, such as assessment of mortality,
real world response and progression, time to treatment failure,
or time to switch in therapy. Ultimately, the success of new
oncology therapies in the 21st century will not be judged solely
on their performance in pre-marketing studies, but, more
importantly, on how they change outcomes for patients
actually treated in clinical practice—the definitive metric of
