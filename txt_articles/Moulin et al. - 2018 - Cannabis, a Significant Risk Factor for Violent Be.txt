Background: Previous literature suggests that prevalence of cannabis use in the early
phase of psychosis is high, and that early psychosis patients are at high-risk for violent
behavior. However, the link between cannabis use and violent behavior in early psychosis
patients is unclear. We carried out a study on a sample of early psychosis patients, in
order to explore the impact of cannabis use on the risk of violent behavior (VB), while
taking into account (1) potential confounding factors and, (2) interactions with other
dynamic risk factors of VB.
Method: In a sample of 265 early psychosis patients, treated at the Treatment and Early
Intervention in Psychosis Program (TIPP) in Lausanne, we used logistic regression models
to explore the link between various dynamic risk factors of VB [positive symptoms,
substance use disorder (drugs including cannabis, alcohol and others drugs), insight,
impulsivity, affective instability, and treatment adherence], and VB occurring during
treatment. In order to understand hierarchical effects attributable to the combinations
of risk factors on VB we conducted a Classification and Regression Tree (CART).
Results:
Our results show that cannabis use disorder is a risk factor for VB. The
associations among risk factors suggest the presence of two patient profiles with an
increased rate of VB: the first is composed of patients with cannabis use disorder and

impulsivity, and the second of patients combining cannabis use disorder, absence of
insight and non-adherence to treatment. The results also show the moderating role of
insight and adherence to treatment on the rate of VB in patients with cannabis use
disorder.
Conclusion: This study suggests that cannabis use disorder is a significant risk factor for
VB amongst early psychosis patients, particularly when combined with either impulsivity,
lack of insight and non-adherence to treatment. These results suggest that preventive
strategies could be developed on the basis of such patient profiles.

INTRODUCTION
Cannabis
use
is
particularly
frequent
among
psychosis
patients (1), especially in early psychosis patients (EPP) (2–
7), and is linked with poorer outcomes in schizophrenia (3) as
well as EPP (4, 8, 9). A recent paper based on data drawn from
the MacArthur study (10) suggests that cannabis use in psychosis
patients is also linked to an increased risk of violent behavior
(VB) and that persistent cannabis use is a significant predictor of
future VB (10). Although the prevalence of cannabis use is well
established among violent people, both in the general population
(11) and among psychotic patients (6), the link between cannabis
use and VB is still a matter of controversy in psychosis (11, 12).
Indeed, there is a lack of consensus on the nature of the link and
its direction with inconsistencies between studies. In addition,
studies have failed to consider potentially confounding dynamic
risk factors (10, 13–15). Very few studies explored this issue
in EPP (2, 16, 17) while taking into account such potentially
confounding factors. In fact, most authors explored the link
between VB and substance use in general (2, 6, 18), without
focusing specifically on cannabis, despite the high prevalence of
cannabis use in EPP patients (17, 19) and the fact that the early
phase of psychosis is known to be at high-risk for VB (18, 20–22).
Consequently, there is a lack of clear understanding on this
important issue.
In
addition,
establishing
the
association
between
the
occurrence of a behavior and one risk factor is not sufficient
to build a preventive strategy. Indeed, considering possible
interplay between different factors is an important part of
developing effective interventions (23–25). This means exploring
the complex patterns of interactions between factors where
the effect of one factor can be neutralized or amplified by the
impact of another (26). In order to develop preventive strategies
for VB, it is therefore particularly important to analyze the
patterns of interaction between dynamic risk factors (features
that therapeutic interventions can modify) (12, 21, 27, 28).
Hence, studies on the impact of comorbid substance use
(alcohol, cannabis, other substances) and psychosis (29–31)
should take into account possible interactions between substance
use and main dynamic risk factors of VB identified in the
literature, such as positive symptoms (32–34), level of insight
(21, 35–37), impulsivity (12, 38, 39), affective instability (40, 41),
and treatment adherence (33, 35). Various studies have shown
that there are subgroups of patients in which these factors
may interact (24, 42–44). Along these lines, Lapworth et al.
(45) showed that positive symptoms interact with impulsivity
to increase the risk of VB in psychotic patients with comorbid
substance use. Other studies on the risk of VB in psychosis
revealed the complex interactions between substance use,
impulsivity and comorbid antisocial personnality disorder (38,
43, 46), the effect of the interaction between substance use and
insight (47, 48) and the links between substance use and poor
adherence to treatment (49). Finally, both the lack of clarity about
the link between insight and VB, which remains controversial in
the literature (35, 50), and the fact that insight has sometimes
been considered a risk factor or a protective factor (22, 27), may
be due to the way in which insight interacts with other factors.
Identifying such interactions between risk factors and their
impact on the occurrence of VB is particularly important in the
early phase of psychosis, as it would allow early identification
of patients at risk of such behaviors and the development of
preventive strategies that could be adapted to subgroups of
patient (22, 23, 25, 44).
In this context and considering the high prevalence of
cannabis use in the early phase of psychosis, we carried out a
study on a sample of early psychosis patients (EPP), in order
to explore the impact of cannabis use on the risk of VB, while
taking into account (1) potentially confounding factors and (2)
interactions with other dynamic factors.
METHODS
Procedure and Participants
Patients
were
recruited
from
the
Treatment
and
early
Intervention
in
Psychosis
Program
(TIPP),
a
specialized
early psychosis program, implemented at the Department of
Psychiatry CHUV, in Lausanne, Switzerland (51, 52). Entry
criteria to the program are: (i) age 18–35 years; (ii) residence
in the catchment area; (iii) meeting threshold criteria for
psychosis, as defined by the ‘Psychosis threshold’ subscale
of the Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental States
Scale (CAARMS) (53). Exclusion criteria are (i) antipsychotic
medication for more than a total of 6 months, (ii) psychosis
related to intoxication or organic brain disease, or (iii) an
intelligence quotient <70. Considering that, like in other similar
clinical programs, first treatment for psychosis sometimes occurs

Cannabis and Violent Behavior in Psychosis
only at the time of a second psychotic episode, we consider this
cohort is composed of “early psychosis patients” (EPP) rather
than strictly first episode psychosis (FEP) patients.
Case managers, who have up to one hundred contacts with
patients over the three years of treatment, fill in a specifically
designed questionnaire for all patients enrolled in the program.
It allows the assessment of demographic characteristics, past
medical history, exposure to life events as well as level of
symptoms and functioning at the moment of entry in the
program. The questionnaire is based on information gathered
from patients and their family over the first few weeks of
treatment and updated during follow up. Follow-up assessments
exploring various aspects of treatment and co-morbidities as well
as evolution of functional level are conducted by case managers
after 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months in treatment. A research
psychologist assesses the level of symptoms at each measurement
occasion during follow-up. The Research and Ethics Committee
of the Faculty of Biology and Medicine of Lausanne University
granted access to Treatment and Early Intervention in Psychosis
Program clinical data for research purposes.
At the time of this study, 265 patients had been followed-up
prospectively over 36 months, and were dichotomised based on
the presence or not of VB. The group of Violent Patients had
committed physical aggression against people at least once, either
before entering into the program and/or during the program,
meeting definition of “serious violence” i.e., “as assault causing
any degree of injury, any use of a weapon or any sexual assault.
The term any was used when the severity of the violence was not
specified (21).”
Measures
Positive Symptoms, Substance Use Disorder, Insight,
Impulsivity, Affective Instability, and Treatment
Adherence
The level of positive symptoms was measured using the positive
subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
(54). Substance use disorder (SUD) was assessed in 2 ways,
first on the basis of DSM-IV criteria (43); secondly being rated
dichotomously as “present” or “absent” on the basis of scores
from the Case Manager Rating Scale (CMRS) (55). This scale
allows the rating of the intensity of substance use on a scale
ranging from 1 to 5 (1 being absence and 5 very severe substance
use), and ratings corresponding to “absent/light substance use”
were scored as absence of SUD, whereas ratings corresponding
to “moderate to severe substance use” were scored as presence
of SUD. Three types of substances were considered: cannabis,
alcohol and other drugs (opioids, cocaine, hallucinogens, and
others). The level of insight was rated, using a 3-point scale, as
either absent, partial or full. Full insight meant awareness of the
illness and the necessity of treatment. Impulsivity was assessed
by the addition of 2 PANSS items: “poor impulse control” and
“difficulty in delaying gratification,” which correspond to the
definition of impulsivity proposed by Moeller et al. (56). Affective
instability was rated by the PANSS item “Affective instability,”
which assesses unstable, fluctuating, inadequate and/or poorly
controlled emotional responses. Treatment adherence was
assessed on a 3-point scale of Treatment Adherence Scale [TAS
(57)] ranging from 0 to 2: 0 = no adherence; 1 = partial
adherence (from 25 to 75% of the time during the evaluation
period); 2 = total adherence (from 75 to 100% of the time during
the evaluation period).
Diagnostic Assessment and Personality Disorders
Assessment
Diagnosis and comorbid personality disorders were the result
of an expert consensus (between psychiatrist and psychologist)
and based on the following elements: (1) the disorders reported
by treating psychiatrists in all medical documents and at the
end of any hospitalization; (2) longitudinal assessment by
clinical case managers, after 36 months (58). In this study, the
main diagnoses and the comorbid personality disorders were
taken into account according to the diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders [DSM-IV (59)]. Diagnosis was sub-
divided into 5 classes: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,
Schizoaffective
disorder,
major
depression
with
psychotic
features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features. We have
considered comorbid personality disorders, including antisocial
personality disorders.
Identification of Episodes of Violent Behavior
Episodes of VB were identified in three distinct ways. First,
case managers recorded information regarding the occurrence of
violent offenses (Swiss Criminal Code) and VB (such as assault
and battery) in a specific chapter of the baseline questionnaire,
a reliable method considering the meta-analysis of Winsper et al.
(60) that showed good reliability and validity in the self-reporting
of serious aggression. Secondly, case managers gathered any
additional information through contact with parents, significant
others and the forensic psychiatric services (hetero reporting
of aggression) over the entire duration of treatment. Finally,
episodes of VB occurring during the treatment phase were
identified on the basis of the Staff Observation Aggression Scale
[SOAS-R scale (61), a structured assessment tool], which lists all
critical events related to a VB during hospitalisations (44).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses have been performed using R environment
for statistical computing (Packages boot and glm for the logistic
regression part and Package rpart for the Classification and
Regression Trees and package stats for calculating correlations).
As mentioned above, for these analyzes, we considered the
dynamic factors assessed at program entry, and conducted the
analysis only for patients who committed violent acts during
the treatment phase (N = 62). Logistic regression was used
to assess the direct link between dynamic risk factors [positive
symptoms, SUD (cannabis, alcohol and other drugs), insight,
impulsivity, affective instability and treatment adherence] and
VB committed during the program. We adjusted the model
for the main diagnosis and comorbid personality disorder as
potential confounding factors. The uncertainty of estimated
parameters was assessed using 10,000 bootstrap iterations (62)
to ensure the robustness of inferences made based on this
model. Bootstrap iterations and fitting steps were performed
using “boot” and “glm” functions of R environment for statistical
computing, included in “boot” and “stats” libraries respectively.

Cannabis and Violent Behavior in Psychosis
The Classification and Regression Tree (26) (CART) was used
in order to understand the hierarchical effects attributable to the
combinations of risk factors on VB, considering that the effects of
each of them could be increased or moderated by the presence of
others. CARTs are capable of discerning hierarchical associations
among a series of explanatory variables and a response variable.
Variables with high predictive power appear at the top branches
of the tree to form contrasting subgroups of patients. Here,
CARTs are constructed using the Recursive Partitioning and
Regression Trees algorithm (26) implemented in “rpart” library
of Team RC (63). The split rule is based on the Generalized
Gini index, which describes the node purity at each node based
on each split; the minimum number of observations necessary
for a split is fixed at 20. After constructing the tree, pruning
can be performed based on the desired complexity of the tree,
which is measured by the parameter called Complexity Parameter
representing the decrease in relative error rate of the tree if
the split at that node is performed. In this analysis, positive
symptoms, SUD (cannabis, alcohol and hard drugs), insight,
impulsivity, affective instability and treatment adherence were
entered as independent variables and VB as the dependent
variable.
It is also important to explore the associations between risk
factors identified as influential on VB, because a high association
among these factors may influence the results and consequently
our understanding of their association with the VB as the
response. Due to the ordinal nature of these factors, we have
used Spearman’s correlation on these factors to explore potential
associations among them.
RESULTS
Descriptive Characteristics of the Study
Sample
Violent patients were significantly more likely to be men, with a
low level of education and no professional activity. They suffered
mainly from schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder. Other
detailed characteristics are outlined in Table 1.
Violent Behaviors
Among the 265 patients included in the study, 72 displayed
VB that involved a person (27.2%) and 15 (5.7%) a crime
against property only; the latter were excluded from the study
considering they could be considered neither as control nor as

Cannabis and Violent Behavior in Psychosis
violent patients. Of the 72 patients, 62 have been violent during
the program and 10 patients only before entry into the program.
The analysis was therefore conducted in a sample of 240 patients
(178 Non-Violent Patients and 62 violent patients only during
the program).
Relationship Between Dynamic Factors
and VB
Logistic regression model on the dynamic factors, have
shown statistically significant association between Cannabis Use
Disorder (CUD) and VB [z(3.99) = 0.41; p = 0.0001]; impulsivity
and VB [z(2.15) = 0.159; p = 0.03], while the links with
alcohol and hard drugs use, positive symptoms, insight, affective
instability and treatment adherence were not significant. The
uncertainties of these parameters were estimated using 10000
bootstrap iterations; the results were not sensitive to the number
of bootstrap iterations. When the model was adjusted for the
main diagnosis (model 2) and comorbid personality disorder
(model 3) no change was observed, and as before CUD and
impulsivity remained significantly associated with VB (Table 2).

Combined Hierarchical Effect of Factors
on the Rate of VB
The CART analysis (see Figure 1) revealed the role played by
dynamic factors by exploring their hierarchical mutual effects
and patient subgroups. To hierarchically describe the importance
of factors influencing membership in subgroup, the factors
mentioned are decisive for distinguishing subgroups and each
cell describes the number of patients, the percentage on the
sample and the percentage of VP in each subgroup.
CART analysis has identified four main factors presented
in decreasing order of importance. First factor: CUD; second:
impulsivity; third: insight and fourth factor: treatment adherence.
The other studied factors did not appear in the results of this
analysis.
Subgroups of patients: CUD plays an important role in VB
(first factor that dichotomized the tree). In the subgroup without
CUD, only 15% of patients (N = 24/158) displayed VB, and 85%
of them did not. In the CUD subgroup, 46% of patients (N =
38/82) displayed VB. In this subgroup, Impulsivity dichotomized
the tree in two: in a first little subgroup (N = 13), composed of
patients with CUD, presence of impulsivity (higher than 4.5) led
to a 77% of VB in this subgroup (N = 10/13). In the second (N
= 69), when such patients were cannabis user, had low level of
impulsivity (under 4.5) but had lack of insight (lower than 0.5),
the rate of VB raised to 53% (N = 16/30), while it fell to 30.7%
(N = 12/39) in presence of insight. 69% (N = 27/39) of patients
in the subgroup with insight did not display VB. Among patients
with CUD, lack of insight and lack of treatment adherence were
linked to a 58% rate of VB (N = 11/19), while 45% of such
patients (N = 5/11), had displayed VB if they had treatment
adherence.
In order to understand the relationships between factors that
emerged in CART analysis, we explored correlations between
factors. We observed that (a) CUD is not correlated to impulsivity
significantly, (b) CUD is negatively correlated both with insight
(p = 0.002; rho −0.206), and treatment adherence (p = 0.000;
rho −0.232); (c) lack of insight and lack of treatment adherence
were not linked together. Relatively small correlation coefficients
observed here will not impose any multicollinearity between
factors in CART analysis.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study attempting to explore
the interaction between CUD, various dynamic risk factors, and
the risk of VB in the early phase of psychosis. Our main findings
are the following. First, CUD is the strongest risk factor of
VB. Second, impulsivity seems to be an important risk for VB.

 Moulin et al.
Cannabis and Violent Behavior in Psychosis
Third, the exploration of the interactions between risk factors
suggest the presence of two main patient profiles, who display
a combination of CUD and dynamic risk factors, which lead to
an increased rate of VB. Fourth, insight and treatment adherence
play an indirect role, moderating the rate of VB in EPP who use
cannabis.
Cannabis Use Disorder and Impulsivity
In our EPP cohort, classically composed of two thirds of males
aged on average 24 at treatment entry, 33% of patients use
cannabis, which is in line with data provided by other cohorts
(3). Interestingly, the prevalence of CUD was 61% in patients
who displayed VB, while it was only of 23% in patients who did
not, suggesting a link between these two factors. After controlling
for the impact of alcohol abuse, other forms of substance
abuse, dynamic risk factors, diagnosis and personality disorder
comorbidity, our results confirm previous data (5) showing that
CUD is a significant risk factor for the occurrence of VB (51), and
show this specifically in an early psychosis population. Previous
research in similar populations showed that substance abuse in
general is a risk for VB (17, 18, 22, 27). Establishing that CUD
plays a specific role in this matter is important considering its
high prevalence in EPP and it’s early onset at age 15 in violent
patients (6, 7, 64, 65), and the fact that it can be influenced
by treatment, especially in young patients (7, 66). Specialized
early intervention programs should therefore include specific
interventions to treat CUD in order to prevent not only poorer
outcome (2, 5) but also the occurrence and persistence of VB (10).
The study of the nature of the links between impulsivity and
VB has produced contradicting results, some studies supporting
a direct relationship with VB, while others suggested this link
would be indirect (38). Although this link in psychosis patients
is a matter of controversy (12, 46, 67–69), our results are
in support of a positive association between impulsivity and
VB. However, since impulsivity is a multifaceted construct
(70, 71), this result must be confirmed in future studies
applying a multi-dimensional scale to assess this dimension. This
would allow to examine whether certain specific dimensions of
impulsivity (in particular lack of control and difficulty in delaying
satisfaction) rather than a global trait of impulsivity are related
to VB.
Two Patterns of Interaction of Factors
The use of CART analysis allowed us to identify patient
subgroups where various risk factors seem to interact and to
classify them according to a hierarchical order of importance.
This information may provide useful information for the
development of treatment strategies.
Subgroup 1: Cannabis Use Disorder and Impulsivity
The first violent patients subgroup, composed of patients
displaying CUD and impulsivity had the highest rate of VB,
and the combination of these two factors explained 77% of
the occurrences of VB in this subgroup. It is likely that the
combination of a tendency to react impulsively combined with
the disinhibiting effect of CUD leads to reactive and unplanned
violent acts (42, 72), in response to everyday situations. In
addition, impulsivity can lead to substance abuse (73, 74), which
in turn can increase impulsivity (69), leading to a pernicious
vicious circle. Finally, from a neurodevelopmental point of view,
abuse of illicit substances, which often starts in adolescence (our
results showed that the age of onset of cannabis use in violent
patients was 15 years versus 17 years in non-violent patients),
could have a deleterious impact on the developing brain, which is
particularly sensitive to the neurotoxic effect of such compounds
(69, 75, 76). Indeed, the results of a recent meta-analysis of
imaging studies exploring the link between cannabis use and
impulsivity suggests cannabis has an impact both on the structure
and on the function of the brain, notably at the level of the
prefrontal cortex which is specifically involved in the control of
behavior (77).
Subgroup 2: Cannabis Use Disorder, Lack of Insight
and Lack of Treatment Adherence
The second high-risk subgroup of VB was composed of cannabis
users who simultaneously exhibited an absence of insight and
non-adherence to medication. While the multivariate logistic
regression suggested insight has no direct impact on VB, the
results of CART analysis revealed that insight indeed had an
influence on VB, but only in the subgroup of cannabis user,
its absence being linked to 53% of VB in this subgroup. These
results suggest that insight has an indirect impact on VB, and
that it plays a moderating role in this matter, which may explain
why the literature has been inconsistent on this issue in the past
(22, 35, 50). In line with previous findings on protective factors
against VB (13, 67), we found that the presence of insight and
adherence to treatment decreases the likelihood of VB, in EPP,
and specifically here, in patients who use cannabis.
In this second subgroup, in line with Swartz study’s (78), our
results show that combination of substance abuse, lack of insight
and treatment adherence increases the risk of VB (58% of VB).
Our analysis allowed the exploration of the interaction between
the three factors at play in this subgroup. The literature has
identified that these factors can be mutually reinforcing, which
may explain the potentiation of their effects to increase the VB
rate in this subgroup. To our knowledge, few studies directly
addressed the effect of cannabis use on insight level (or vice
versa). Some studies showed that cannabis use is linked to lack of
insight (47, 48). Whereas, others studies revealed that cannabis
use has an effect on both treatment resistance (4, 21) and non-
recognition of illness, in that patients may attribute symptoms
to the effects of cannabis. In addition, some authors have shown
that treatment non-adherence and substance abuse can reinforce
each other to the extent that cognitive difficulty associated with
drug use can impede compliance. Further, Ekinci (79) mentions
that the combination of lack of insight and lack of treatment
adherence may increase VB, by impeding the recognition of
psychotic symptoms. Based on the above-mentioned work (79),
we can hypothesize that difficulty induced by the combination
of these three factors could contribute to increase cognitive
distortions and difficulties in social interactions which in turn
could lead to aggressive reactions against others (44, 50).
If this were to be proven in future research, the complex
intrication of these factors would justify the development of an

integrated treatment strategy targeting these three dimensions
simultaneously (48).
LIMITATIONS
Our study suffers from various limitations. First, the small
sample size excludes the generalization of these results. Second,
impulsivity was measured on the basis of 2 PANSS items rather
than on the basis of a specialized scale. Third, assessment
of positive symptoms was not always simultaneous to the
occurrence of VB. Fourth, although we used different methods in
order to assess the occurrence of VB (self-reporting by patients,
hetero-reporting by relatives, information stemming from the
forensic services and assessment by a standardized instrument),
occurrence of VB prior to entry into the program might have
been under evaluated, due to absence of access to police and
criminal records. Fifth, although the analysis was conducted on
the basis of some of the main potential dynamic risk factors for
violent behavior, other potential dynamic risk factors may be
considered in future studies. In addition, as mentioned above,
assessment of personality disorder was the result of an expert
consensus but was not based on a specific assessment, and it is
therefore not excluded that some aspects of this diagnosis may
have been missed. Finally, the result of our analysis is mainly
correlational and we can’t exclude that “inherently” violent
patients may have started to use cannabis in an attempt to
experience a calming effect.
CONCLUSION
Considering CUD is highly prevalent amongst patients with
psychosis (1) and even more so amongst EPP (2, 3), our
results suggest it should be the target of early intervention,
especially when combined with either impulsivity or lack of
insight considering the observed association between CUD and
violent behavior. Our results also suggest more research is needed
regarding protective factors that may actually decrease risk of
VB in patients despite their cannabis use; this would allow the
development of interventions that would focus on resources
of patients and their environment, which may, as indicated by
a few studies (80–82), facilitate patients’ engagement in such
treatments (83–86).
