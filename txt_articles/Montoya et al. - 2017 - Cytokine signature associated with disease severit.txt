Although some signs of inflammation have been reported previously
in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome
(ME/CFS), the data are limited and contradictory. High-throughput
methods now allow us to interrogate the human immune system for
multiple markers of inflammation at a scale that was not previously
possible. To determine whether a signature of serum cytokines could
be associated with ME/CFS and correlated with disease severity and
fatigue duration, cytokines of 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy
controls were measured using a 51-multiplex array on a Luminex
system. Each cytokine’s preprocessed data were regressed on ME/CFS
severity plus covariates for age, sex, race, and an assay property of
newly discovered importance: nonspecific binding. On average, TGF-β
was elevated (P = 0.0052) and resistin was lower (P = 0.0052) in
patients compared with controls. Seventeen cytokines had a statis-
tically significant upward linear trend that correlated with ME/CFS
severity: CCL11 (Eotaxin-1), CXCL1 (GROα), CXCL10 (IP-10), IFN-γ, IL-4,
IL-5, IL-7, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17F, leptin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF, NGF, SCF,
and TGF-α. Of the 17 cytokines that correlated with severity, 13 are
proinflammatory, likely contributing to many of the symptoms ex-
perienced by patients and establishing a strong immune system
component of the disease. Only CXCL9 (MIG) inversely correlated
with fatigue duration.

myalgic encephalomyelitis
M
yalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/
CFS) is a complex and debilitating disease of unknown
etiology affecting more than one million Americans and mil-
lions of individuals worldwide (1, 2). ME/CFS is characterized
by persistent or relapsing unexplained fatigue of at least 6-mo
duration that is not alleviated by rest and results in a substantial
reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, so-
cial, and personal activities (2–5). In ME/CFS patients, fatigue
is just one of multiple incapacitating symptoms that include
cognitive impairment, postexertional malaise, unrefreshing
sleep, headaches, myalgias, arthralgias, sore throats, lymph-
adenopathy, hypersensitivity to noise, light, or certain food
items, and autonomic disturbances (4). These symptoms often
cluster in each patient in varying combinations and intensity.
“ME/CFS” has been the term generally preferred by researchers,
but the terms “myalgic encephalomyelitis” (ME) or “chronic fa-
tigue and immune dysfunction syndrome” (CFIDS) are favored by
clinicians and patients, given the wide range of complaints and the
heterogeneity of the illness (1, 4, 6, 7). In a recent report, the
Institute of Medicine proposed a new definition for ME/CFS and
a new name: “systemic exertion intolerance disease” (SEID) (2).
The presence of ongoing or fluctuating flu-like symptoms, ar-
thralgias, myalgias, autonomic disturbances, and a striking hy-
persensitivity to stimuli in many patients with this illness has led to
the suspicion that ME/CFS is an inflammatory or immunological
disorder (8). Surprisingly, conventional markers of inflammation
commonly used in the daily practice of medicine (e.g., erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) are seldom elevated in
ME/CFS patients (9). Tests measuring innate and adaptive im-
mune responses have been reported as abnormal but often yield
negative or conflicting results (8, 10–12). However, in a longitu-
dinal study, fatigue severity was associated with daily fluctuations
of the inflammatory adipokine leptin (13). Also, many studies
have found increased numbers of circulating cytotoxic CD8+ cells
bearing activation antigens (8, 14–16). In addition, in a cross-
sectional study, Hornig et al. (17) reported a distinct cytokine
inflammatory signature associated with early disease.
One large epidemiological study reported a higher risk of non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.29, 95% CI =
1.16–1.43, P value < 0.0001], marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)
(OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.38–2.57), and diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.12–1.61) in pa-
tients older than 65 y of age with ME/CFS (15). The state of
chronically activated cellular immunity that has been reported by
several laboratories might plausibly explain this association.
The purpose of the present study was to use a comprehensive
immune-profiling approach to determine whether an abnormal
profile of circulating cytokines could be identified in ME/CFS
patients and whether this profile correlated with disease severity
and/or fatigue duration.
Significance
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
devastates the lives of millions of people and has remained a
mystery illness despite decades of research. It has long been
suspected that inflammation is central to its pathogenesis. Al-
though only two cytokines were found to be different (TGF-β
higher and resistin lower) in ME/CFS patients compared with
controls, 17 cytokines correlated with ME/CFS severity. Thir-
teen of these cytokines are proinflammatory and may con-
tribute to many of the symptoms these patients experience for
several years. Only CXCL9 (MIG) inversely correlated with
fatigue duration.

 Results
Basic Demographics. ME/CFS patients and healthy controls had a
comparable age (49.9 and 50.1 y, respectively) and sex distribu-
tion (76.6 and 77.3% female, respectively) as expected from the
age and sex-matched design (Table 1). The ME/CFS patient
group had a higher proportion of Caucasian individuals (91.7%)
compared with healthy controls (71.2%; P < 0.0001). Race data
were missing for 10 participants. Six of the ten participants for
whom race data were lacking were ME/CFS cases, and four were
controls. The six ME/CFS patients did not differ from the 186
ME/CFS cases that were included in the study. The four controls
did not differ from the 388 controls included in the study. Be-
cause of their missing race data, these 10 participants were ex-
cluded from the cytokine analysis, yielding a final sample size of
574 individuals.
Cytokine findings presented in this section are only those
following appropriate adjustment for nonspecific binding. These
analyses were performed separately by cytokine. Cytokine pre-
processed median fluorescence intensity (pMFI) was regressed
on age, sex, race, and nonspecific binding. Additionally, only
findings that were statistically significant following adjustment
for multiple comparisons [controlling false discovery rate (FDR)
at 5%] are reported in this section.
Analysis of ME/CFS Cases vs. Healthy Controls. The average pMFI of
two cytokines was found to be significantly different in ME/CFS
patients and in healthy controls. TGF-β (P = 0.0052) was elevated
in ME/CFS patients, and resistin (P = 0.0052) was lower (Table 2).
In addition, three cytokines were significantly different in cases and
controls when stratified by severity, as shown in Fig. 1 (red brackets).
The average pMFI of IL-13 was significantly higher in the severe
group (P = 0.0250) than in controls; leptin was significantly lower in
the mild group (P = 0.0495), and resistin was significantly lower in
the mild (P = 0.0370) and severe (P = 0.0208) groups (Table 3).
Analysis of ME/CFS Cases by Disease Severity. Overall, 17 cytokines
were found to have a statistically significant upward linear trend
across the sequence of mild, moderate, and severe ME/CFS se-
verity: CCL11 (P = 0.0069), CXCL1 (P = 0.0266), CXCL10 (P =
0.0100), G-CSF (P = 0.0110), GM-CSF (P = 0.0063), IFN-γ (P =
0.0101), IL-4 (P = 0.0103), IL-5 (P = 0.0073), IL-7 (P = 0.0063),
IL-12p70 (P = 0.0069), IL-13 (P = 0.0069), IL-17F (P = 0.0103),
leptin (P = 0.0100), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (P =
0.0100), nerve growth factor (NGF) (P = 0.0069), stem cell
factor (SCF) (P = 0.0145), and TGF-α (P = 0.0367) (Fig. 2 and
Table 4). Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and
resistin exhibited a statistically significant, nonlinear, inverted
trend (P = 0.0334 for each) (Fig. 1).
Analysis of ME/CFS Cases by Fatigue Duration. In Spearman corre-
lation analyses, before controlling for potentially confounding
variables, several cytokines were found to correlate inversely with
fatigue duration: Growth related oncogene-α (GRO-α or CXCL1),
IFN-β, IL-1α, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-8, IL-15, TGF-α, and TGF-β (SI
Appendix, SI Materials and Methods and Table S1). Following cor-
rection for age, nonspecific binding, race, and sex, only one cyto-
kine, CXCL9 (monokine induced by interferon-γ, MIG), was found
to correlate inversely with fatigue duration (unadjusted for multiple
comparisons, P = 0.0123) (SI Appendix, Table S1). Although the
inclusion of fatigue duration as an additional covariate was expected
to result in a loss of statistical power, regression analysis by both
disease severity and fatigue duration revealed that the upward lin-
ear trend across disease severity remained statistically significant for
CCL11, CXCL10, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-
12p70, IL-13, IL-17F, leptin, LIF, NGF, ICAM1, and resistin. The
findings by severity for CXCL1, SCF, and TGF-α shifted slightly
above the threshold for statistical significance (CXCL1, adjusted
P = 0.0536; SCF, adjusted P = 0.0531; TGF-α, adjusted P = 0.0797),
possibly because of variance inflation (18) by the independent
covariate of fatigue duration. Only CXCL9 and IL-1α inversely
correlated with fatigue duration but lost statistical significance after
correction for multiple comparisons (SI Appendix, Table S2). We
also compared mean cytokine levels in cases with ≤3-y fatigue du-
ration (n = 30) and those with >3-y fatigue duration (n = 156), as
per Hornig et al. (17). We did not find any cytokine to be signifi-
cantly different between these two groups (SI Appendix, Table S3).
Discussion
Fifty-one serum cytokines were measured in a cross-sectional study
of 186 ME/CFS patients and 388 healthy controls matched by age
and sex. A single serum sample was obtained at baseline without
any physical, emotional, or neurocognitive stimulation. Only two
cytokines were found to be significantly different on average in ME/
CFS patients when compared as a group with healthy controls:
TGF-β was elevated, and resistin was lower.
TGF-β has been found to be elevated in ME/CFS patients in five
of eight studies (63%), as highlighted in a meta-analysis by Blundell
et al. (10). TGF-β is a 112-amino acid protein that provides cells with
the pleiotropic capacity to affect cell-developmental programs and
behavior, including cell proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis,
tissue homeostasis, and regeneration (19). The principal cell sources
of TGF-β include monocytes, macrophages, T cells (primarily reg-
ulatory T cells), chondrocytes, and intestinal epithelial cells, involving
both innate and adaptive immune responses. Given the pleiotropism
of TGF-β and its wide availability, its implication in the patho-
genesis of apparently dissimilar conditions such as Marfan syn-
drome (20), cancer (in both control and development) (21), renal
fibrosis (22), chronic pulmonary diseases (23), liver disease (24),

 and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (25) is unsurprising. Be-
cause TGF-β has been implicated in the development of cancer,
elevation of this cytokine in ME/CFS patients older than 65 y of
age could contribute to their possibly increased risk of NHL and
two defined NHL subtypes, MZL and DLBCL, following their
ME/CFS diagnosis (26). Moreover, apart from ME/CFS, other

Statistically significant comparisons of disease severity level vs. healthy controls (adjusted P < 0.05, Table 3) are in red. Results were adjusted for multiple com-

nonlinear trends across disease severity levels in ICAM1 and resistin (Table 4).

 studies have found and proposed a direct link between circulating
levels of TGF-β and the risk of NHL (27, 28).
TGF-β, along with IL-10, is primarily viewed as an anti-
inflammatory cytokine. The TGF-β elevation in ME/CFS patients
may represent down-regulatory activity by these patients’ im-
mune systems against unremitting inflammation; if so, however,
one would expect TGF-β levels to correlate with ME/CFS se-
verity, as was observed with several proinflammatory cytokines in
this study. Alternatively, it appears that TGF-β does not always
function to counteract inflammation. Despite the overarching
view of TGF-β as an immunosuppressive (anti-inflammatory)
cytokine, its net effect may depend on the local immunological
milieu at target tissues and the overall levels of TGF-β (29). For
instance, in patients with active IBD, TGF-β has been found at
Table 3.

 increased levels in the inflamed gut compared with mucosa un-
affected by the disease (25). Thus, elevated levels of TGF-β in
ME/CFS patients may actually be detrimental and may be
a major factor in promoting relentless inflammation and a
“fibrotic” milieu resistant to therapeutic interventions in some
ME/CFS patients.
Resistin is a cytokine produced primarily by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in humans and by adipocytes (i.e.,
as an adipocytokine) in rodents (30). Resistin in humans appears
to have a significant proinflammatory role by targeting PBMCs,
endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, platelets (30), and chon-
drocytes (31) and by increasing the release of IL-1β, IL-6, and
TNF-α via the NF-κB pathway (32). Resistin has been reported
to be a marker of inflammation in systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) and Crohn’s disease in humans (33). It is unclear at this
time why resistin had this unusual behavior in our study, in-
creasing with mild to moderate disease severity but decreasing
with moderate to severe disease. A similar trend was observed in
other cytokines including ICAM1 (Fig. 1). An analogous bio-
logical behavior is observed in other disease processes such as
hepatitis, in which transaminases increase with the severity of
inflammation in the liver but actually decline after a certain level
of severity is reached as a result of exhaustion and the inability of
the hepatocytes to produce these enzymes.
Remarkably, 17 cytokines were associated with severity in ME/
CFS patients. Thirteen of these 17 cytokines are primarily
proinflammatory: CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL10, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5,
IL-7, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, leptin, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. In-
terestingly, 11 (65%) of the 17 cytokines and 9 (69%) of the
13 proinflammatory cytokines are classified as “type I” by sharing
a similar 3D structure, i.e., a four α-helical bundle structure.
Their linear relationship with severity was statistically significant
even after correction for multiple comparisons, even though
these 17 cytokines did not distinguish cases from controls overall.
This apparent paradox is explained by the levels of these cyto-
kines in patients with mild disease being below or in the lower
range for healthy controls and the levels in patients with severe
disease being in the higher or upper range for healthy controls
(Figs. 1 and 2). This dysregulation to extremes of normative
range also may explain why several studies, including ours, have
reported few or no cytokine levels that distinguish ME/CFS cases
from controls (10). Above all, it suggests that severity may be a
key variable for subgrouping ME/CFS. Furthermore, the levels
of circulating cytokines in response to inflammatory triggers such
as infection have been reported by various groups to be lower
than in controls for some cytokines and higher for others (34–
36). A response with lower levels of cytokines may represent a
down-regulatory effort by the immune system in an attempt to
attenuate more severe immunopathology, resulting in milder or
even no symptomatology. A response with higher levels may
indicate that the immune system is dealing with a greater chal-
lenge that is more likely to result in immunopathology and
symptoms. ME/CFS patients in the mild category (with cytokine
levels in the lower range) would be protected from more severe
disease through this mechanism, whereas those in the severe
category would suffer on the opposite side of the spectrum. In
addition to a response to an inflammatory trigger, these cytokine
findings associated with severity also suggest a dose–response
defect in the metabolism or excretion of cytokines. With the lack
of large and long-term longitudinal studies in ME/CFS patients, it
is not possible at this time to establish whether patients evolve
over time as a continuum from mild, to moderate, to severe dis-
ease or if a patient is set to stay within a range of a specific cat-
egory of severity for the duration of the illness.
A second apparent paradox is harder to explain: The two cy-
tokines that did distinguish cases from controls, TGF-β and
resistin, did not exhibit a linear relationship with disease severity.
It may be that TGF-β and resistin contribute to ME/CFS path-
ogenesis independent of disease severity.
One of the challenging clinical features of ME/CFS is the capacity
of the illness to persist for several years. Thus, the inflammatory state
described here might persist, unabated, for decades. Adipokines
have been proposed as mediators and perpetuators of chronic in-
flammatory diseases (37). In this study, two adipokines were identified
as being important: leptin and resistin. Thus, it is biologically plausible
that changes in adipocyte tissue (in the bone marrow and/or periph-
eral tissues) linked to increased production of these adipokines may
be a factor in the propagation of an inflammatory state in ME/CFS.
In the data presented here, leptin was found to correlate with
disease severity. It also was found to correlate significantly with
fatigue severity in a longitudinal study led by Younger et al. (13).
In addition to playing an important role in regulating body

 weight by promoting satiety and increasing energy consumption,
leptin has been identified as a major proinflammatory cytokine
involved in innate and adaptive immune responses (38). In ad-
dition, leptin has been shown to be involved in neutrophil
recruitment, macrophage activation, phagocytosis, activation of
NK cells, dendritic cell survival, skewing T cells toward a
proinflammatory and Th1 phenotype, and acting as a negative
regulator of regulatory T cells (38, 39). Two additional clinical
features in ME/CFS could be explained by the leptin levels in our
patients. ME/CFS occurs more frequently in women than in men
(2). Leptin levels are higher in females than males, even when
corrected for confounding variables such as body mass index

 (BMI) or level of adiposity (40, 41), and therefore some have
suggested that leptin may play a role in the influence of sex on
the development of diseases including multiple sclerosis and
SLE, which predominantly affect females (37); ME/CFS may be
another such disease. In addition, ME/CFS patients often com-
plain of significant cognitive and neurological symptoms, and a
recent study suggested that neuroinflammation could be a central
feature of the disease (42, 43). Recently, adipokines have been
invoked as mediators of an ongoing crosstalk between adipose
tissue and the CNS that on occasion, following an unknown trig-
ger, can result in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative dis-
eases (44). Leptin also has been reported recently to up-regulate
the recruitment of neutrophils into the brain in a murine model
of sepsis induced by systemic administration of LPS, providing
another plausible mechanism for its ability to cause neuro-
inflammation (45). Thus, it is possible that the CNS abnormalities
observed in ME/CFS patients can be explained, at least in part, by
the ability of leptin and resistin to cross and/or disrupt the blood–
brain barrier (46). Moreover, systemic inflammation, such as that
found in our patients, has been invoked as a mechanism for
neuroinflammation in other neurodegenerative disease models
(47–49). In animal models, systemic administration of LPS alone
has been shown to result in neuroinflammation (45, 50).
Recently, Hornig et al. (17) reported a group of cytokines that
inversely correlated with fatigue duration, and in our cytokine
assay we investigated the same 51 cytokines. In our study, several
cytokines [GRO-α (CXCL-1), IFN-β, IL-15, IL-1A, IL-1RA, IL-2,
IL-8, TGF-α, and TGF-β] also inversely correlated with fatigue
duration before controlling for potentially confounding variables
(age, nonspecific binding, race, and sex). After correction for age
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3), nonspecific binding, and race, only one
cytokine, CXCL9, inversely correlated with fatigue duration.
When analysis was performed for both disease severity and fa-
tigue duration, the findings for disease severity remained statis-
tically significant for most cytokines, whereas those for fatigue
duration did not. It is possible that disease duration and severity
interact in their association with cytokine expression. To assess
that possibility for each cytokine separately, we fit a regression
model that allows mean cytokine expression levels to vary flexibly
over the 2D distribution of total scores from the Multidimen-
sional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) assessment of disease severity
(51) and fatigue duration in years (52). This analysis found no
evidence that the relationship between mean cytokine expression
and disease severity changes with duration of disease (SI Appendix,
Table S4). The importance of analyzing ME/CFS data by severity
is further supported by the lack of correlation between fatigue
duration and disease severity (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). However, the
lack of observed correlation between disease (fatigue) duration
and cytokine levels may result from the lower statistical power of
the current study, because the sizes of both our overall sample of
cases (n = 186) and, especially, of cases with ≤3-y fatigue duration
(n = 30), were smaller than those studied by Hornig et al. Thus,
our failure to discover any differences between short and long
duration does not allow us to rule out definitively the possibility
that mean serum levels might differ between these two specific
fatigue-duration categories (≤3 y vs. >3 y). A study by Landi et al.
(53) measured 31 cytokines in 100 ME/CFS patients with disease
of “long duration” and in 79 healthy controls and observed re-
ductions in IL-16, IL-7, and VEGF-A levels in ME/CFS patients.
Theirs is the first ME/CFS study to measure IL-16. Although the
Landi et al. study did not adjust for disease severity, the authors
concluded through multivariate data analysis techniques that IL-16
could be an important candidate for a biomarker profile in ME/CFS
(53). Unfortunately, our cytokine assay did not include IL-16.
A nonspecific binding in the Luminex 200 IS system potentially
impacting pMFI signals of some cytokines was found in our study
(SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods). This discovery was pos-
sible through analysis of residual data that usually are considered
inconsequential in most studies. The adjustment for nonspecific
binding was applied to the 51 cytokines of all participants and was
significant for some of the cytokines (e.g., IFN-β) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S2). This adjustment allowed our study to decrease noise and,
we believe, to produce data that may be closer to the actual bi-
ological underpinnings of ME/CFS. Multiplex assays that allow the
measurement of a significant number of analytes, in contrast to
assays that measure only a few analytes, are an efficient tool for
advancing our understanding of disease processes. However, pit-
falls such as this one for nonspecific binding should be anticipated
and, if found, corrected.
Limitations of our study include the cross-sectional design.
Future longitudinal studies are necessary to address whether ME/
CFS patients remain within their cytokine signature and disease
severity category over time or fluctuate among them. We sampled
only peripheral blood and not other compartments such as cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF). Cytokine studies in the CSF of ME/CFS
patients have reported abnormalities even though the sample size
has been modest and simultaneous serum samples were not ana-
lyzed (54, 55). In one study, a diathesis to allergic and inflam-
matory responses in CSF, similar to some of our findings, were
found in these patients (54, 55). In addition, because resistin and
leptin are important adipokines, correction for patients’ BMI
would have been ideal. However, this correction was not possible
with the current dataset. Findings in this study provide further
evidence that ME/CFS likely involves a systemic inflammatory
process (17). These findings also support biological plausibility for
the propensity of these patients to experience several major and
ongoing clinical manifestations, offer a mechanism for the dis-
ease’s predilection to affect women and the increased risk for
development of NHL, and support the suitability of exploring
immunomodulation as a primary or adjuvant therapy (56, 57).
Future cytokine research in the peripheral blood of ME/CFS pa-
tients should embrace longitudinal designs and seek correlations
with neuroradiology, neuroinflammation, and CSF studies. If us-
ing multiplex array-based technologies, investigators should pay
attention to residual data in regression analysis to identify and
correct unrecognized confounders such as nonspecific binding.
Materials and Methods
Study Design. An age- and sex-matched case-control cross-sectional study was
conducted at Stanford University in 2009 to investigate the role of immune
responses, genetic predisposition, and infection in ME/CFS. A total of 192 ME/
CFS cases and 392 healthy controls were included in this analysis. However, the
final sample size was 186 ME/CFS cases and 388 healthy controls because of
missing race information in six ME/CFS cases and four healthy controls. In
addition to the serum analyzed in this report, other peripheral blood specimens
were collected from these individuals and are stored for ongoing and future
immune, genetic, and pathogen-discovery studies. Each case participant was
matched to two control participants by sex and age (±6 mo). To be included in
the study, participants had to be 14 y of age or older, reside in Northern
California, and provide written informed consent and Health Insurance Por-
tability and Accountability Act of 1996 authorization as required by the
Stanford University Institutional Review Board (protocol numbers 18068 and
18155).Participants were classified as cases if they met the 1994 CDC CFS case
definition (3). Of note, symptoms such as unrefreshing sleep, postexertional
malaise, and impaired memory (also referred to by patients as “brain fog”)
were present in 96.9, 96.9, and 95.8% of ME/CFS patients, respectively (Table
1). Controls in the study were eligible if they did not have history of fatigue
and did not meet the ME/CFS case definition. Exclusion criteria for both groups
included active or uncontrolled morbidities that would have interfered with
the patient’s ability to participate in the study, particularly conditions or
medications causing immunosuppression or immunodeficiency (additional
exclusion criteria are given in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods).
Participants were recruited from March 2, 2010 to September 1, 2011, and
their peripheral blood was drawn between 8:30 AM and 3:30 PM on the day
of enrollment. Blood specimens including serum, plasma, whole-blood DNA
and whole-blood RNA (collected in PAXgene tubes), and PBMCs were
obtained and processed on the day of enrollment by the Stanford Center for
Clinical and Translational Research and Education (spectrum.stanford.edu/
accordions/clinical-and-translational-research-unit) and were stored on the

 same day by the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center (HIMC: iti.
stanford.edu/himc.html).
Participants’ age, sex, and age of onset of ME/CFS were recorded at base-
line. The MFI-20, a 20-item questionnaire (51), was administered to each
participant on the day of blood sample collection. A higher score indicates greater
severity. This instrument has been validated in the ME/CFS population (58).
Cytokine Assay. Cytokines were measured for each participant in serum using
a 51-multiplex array on the Luminex 200 IS system (Affymetrix) performed at
the Stanford HIMC. The manufacturer’s protocol was followed, with varia-
tions as described by Brodin, et al. (59).
A total of 19 plates were used. Each participant’s sample was entered in
two replicate wells, and matched sets of ME/CFS cases and healthy controls
were always mixed in all plates to reduce confounding case status with plate
artifacts. Results were accepted as final (569 samples) if more than 95% of
data had a coefficient of variation (CV) <10%. When the CV exceeded 30%
(15 samples), the averaging over duplicate wells reduced the technical var-
iance in median fluorescence intensities (FIs) by twofold.
Each plate also contained two wells of internal control and wells to account for
generic binding to the beads (CHEX1, CHEX2, CHEX3, CHEX4) unrelated to the
target cytokine. Assay CheX beads (Radix BioSolutions) are a mixture of four
quality-control beads that are spiked into each well of a Luminex immunoassay.
Each of the four beads monitors a part of the assay process: instrument per-
formance, application of detection antibody, application of fluorescent reporter,
and nonspecific binding. The last parameter is monitored by the CHEX4 beads,
which have very low intrinsic fluorescence. Elevated CHEX4 fluorescence is in-
dicative of samples containing high levels of nonspecific binding activity. The fact
that nonspecific binding was affecting our results was discovered by statistical
analysis of residual data (variation in observed data not explained by fit of the
regression line, as per graphical explanation of residuals in SI Appendix, Fig. S1)
from regression analysis. T.H.H. discovered that these residual data contained
structure retrievable by multivariate statistical methods. He subsequently dis-
covered that this “residual structure” was strongly correlated with nonspecific
binding and that nonspecific binding was correlated with pMFI in many cyto-
kines and with case status. Therefore, nonspecific binding was included as a
covariate to prevent introduction of bias (60).
Luminex measures the FIs of the cytokines and produces a distribution of
typically 200–300 FIs per well. We computed the median FIs for each distri-
bution per well. Because every participant’s sample was entered in two
wells, two median FIs per cytokine were computed for each participant. For
the median FIs that had bead counts of at least 90, we then computed the
mean value from the two median FIs.
Statistical Analysis.
Preprocessing. Consistent preprocessing across cytokines facilitated their com-
parison and biological interpretation. MFI data were preprocessed (pMFI) for
each cytokine through a sequence of averaging over duplicate wells, natural-
logarithm transformation to reduce variance heterogeneity, isolation and removal
of plate effects, and centering and scaling. Use of population marginal means (61)
adjusted for covariates of age, sex, and race (white vs. nonwhite) permitted es-
timation and removal by subtraction of plate effects that were balanced (i.e.,
1:1 rather than 2:1) with respect to control vs. case status. Centering and scaling
entailed subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the sample SD.
Primary analysis: Disease severity. A priori, cases were classified into tertiles for
ME/CFS severity: MFI-20 scores from 51–75 were classified as mild disease,
scores from 76–85 as moderate disease, and scores from 86–100 as severe
disease. For each cytokine, generalized maximum entropy estimation (GME)
(62) was used to fit a regression model to test hypotheses regarding the four
pMFI means (control and three severities). Specifically, we regressed pMFI on
disease severity category (control, mild, moderate, and severe), sex, race,
age, pMFI of the nonspecific binding control (CHEX4) (for further information
on nonspecific binding, see SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods), and, to
allow for the possibility that covariate effects differ between cases and
controls, interaction terms between case status and each covariate (sex, race,
age, and pMFI of the nonspecific binding control). [We also performed a linear
mixed model regression analysis that, in addition to these covariates, adjusted
for matched set as a random coefficient to account for any remaining structure
caused by the matching process. Matched set explained ∼0% of the variance in
cytokine levels for nearly all cytokines (in the presence of other covariates) and
so was not retained in the results presented here.] Using the fit of the pMFI
data to this regression model, hypothesis testing was used to compare
covariate-adjusted pMFI means between (i) each disease severity group
versus control and (ii) the equally weighted average across all three severity
groups versus control. To compare controls to cases overall, covariates were
held at their sample mean values for cases. To compare controls to each
specific case, severity level, covariates were held at their sample mean values
for the severity level of that specific case. In addition, in post hoc analyses,
the fit of the pMFI data to this regression model was used to examine the
association between mean cytokine response and severity level within cases.
Specifically, we tested for linear and curvilinear trends in pMFI means across
the sequence of mild, moderate, and severe disease. Shapes of sample dis-
tributions of pMFI values across individuals in this sample varied widely
among cytokines. This variety of distributions made GME especially suitable
because this estimation method does not require that the regression re-
sponse variable (here the pMFI) follow any particular parametric distribution
(e.g., normal distribution) (62). Further technical details on application of
GME are provided in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.
Secondary analysis: Fatigue duration. In an analysis limited to cases, we regressed
pMFI on disease severity category (mild, moderate, and severe), sex, race, age,
pMFI of the nonspecific binding control (CHEX4), and the additional covariate
of fatigue duration (in years). Because we allowed covariate effects to differ
between cases and controls in the primary analysis, regression models for cases
are identical for primary and secondary analyses with the exception of fatigue
duration serving as a covariate in secondary analyses. With primary and sec-
ondary regression models otherwise identical, the secondary analysis was able to
isolate the effect of fatigue duration on pMFI. [To examine the robustness of
findings to the method of parameter estimation, in addition to GME, we also fit
regression models to the pMFI data using ordinary least squares (OLS). An OLS (or
closely allied) method was used in a previous report by Hornig et al. (17). Findings
reported here are similar for the GME and OLS regression methods and are
available upon request. Further technical details about the application of OLS are
provided in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.] To permit direct comparison
with another recent report (17), we calculated estimates of Spearman rank cor-
relation coefficients between each cytokine’s pMFI and fatigue duration, and we
took this analysis a step further by adjusting estimates of Spearman rank cor-
relation coefficients for age, nonspecific binding, race, and sex. Further technical
details are provided in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.
Type I error control. Throughout, P values have been adjusted to account for the
accumulation of type 1 error across multiple hypothesis tests. Specifically, P
value adjustments used an adaptive two-stage linear step-up procedure to
control the FDR at 5% (60, 63) across the 51 cytokines. FDR control was per-
formed separately by group (e.g., severity level) to allow for group differences
in the proportions of truly null hypotheses. All analyses were performed in SAS
9.4 (SAS Institute) and R 3.2.2 through 3.3.2 (https://www.R-project.org/).
