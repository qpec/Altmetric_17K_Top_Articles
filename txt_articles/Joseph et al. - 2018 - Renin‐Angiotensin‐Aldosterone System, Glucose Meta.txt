Background-—Mechanistic studies suggest that aldosterone impairs glucose metabolism. We investigated the cross-sectional
associations of aldosterone and plasma renin activity with fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance (IR), b-cell function, and
longitudinal association with incident diabetes mellitus among adults in MESA (the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis)
prospective cohort study.
Methods and Results-—Homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA2-IR) and HOMA2-b were used to estimate IR and b-cell
function, respectively. Incident diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL or anti-diabetic medication
use at follow-up. Linear regression was used to examine cross-sectional associations of aldosterone with fasting plasma glucose,
HOMA2-IR and HOMA2-b; Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for incident diabetes mellitus with multivariable
adjustment. There were 116 cases of incident diabetes mellitus over 10.5 years among 1570 adults (44% non-Hispanic white, 13%
Chinese American, 19% Black, 24% Hispanic American, mean age 64�10 years, 51% female). A 100% increase in log-aldosterone
was associated with a 2.6 mg/dL higher fasting plasma glucose, 15% higher HOMA2-IR and 6% higher HOMA2-b (P<0.01). A 1-SD
increase in log-aldosterone was associated with a 44% higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus (P<0.01) with the greatest increase
of 142% (P<0.01) observed in Chinese Americans (P for interaction=0.09 versus other ethnicities). Similar cross-sectional findings
for log-plasma renin activity existed, but log-plasma renin activity was not associated with incident diabetes mellitus after full
adjustment.
Conclusions-—Aldosterone is associated with glucose homeostasis and diabetes mellitus risk with graded associations among
Chinese Americans and blacks, suggesting that pleiotropic effects of aldosterone may represent a modifiable mechanism in
diabetes mellitus pathogenesis with potential racial/ethnic variation. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e009890. DOI: 10.1161/

T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus incidence has plateaued among
non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) but continues to rise among
US racial/ethnic minorities.1 Thus, novel preventive interven-
tion targets are of paramount importance, one potential
target is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS). Aldos-
terone can impair insulin secretion and sensitivity, both of
these actions are critical factors in the development of type
2 diabetes mellitus.2–4 In a German case-control study, type
2 diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in subjects with
primary aldosteronism (a state of high aldosterone, low
angiotensin II and low plasma renin activity [PRA], most
commonly because of bilateral adrenal gland enlargement or
adrenal adenomas) with hypertension than in hypertensive
controls.5

 associated with a dose-dependent higher risk of the devel-
opment of type 2 diabetes mellitus over 8 years. Recent
observations demonstrate that aldosterone can be produced
autonomously from aldosterone producing cell clusters within
morphologically normal adrenal glands with a large spectrum
and high prevalence of subclinical aldosteronism.7–9 Thus, we
examined the association of aldosterone and PRA with
glucose metabolism and incident diabetes mellitus across the
spectrum of aldosterone levels in a multiethnic cohort to
determine if there are racial/ethnic differences.

Study Population
MESA (the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) is a popu-
lation-based sample of 6814 men and women from 4 racial/
ethnic groups: NHWs (38%), blacks (28%), Chinese Americans
(12%), and Hispanic Americans (22%). Participants were aged
45 to 84 years at baseline without evidence of clinical
cardiovascular disease. Details of sampling and recruitment
are published.10 The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards of the 6 participating institutions (Columbia
University, New York; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore;
Northwestern University, Chicago; University of California, Los
Angeles; University of Minnesota, Twin Cities; Wake Forest
University, Winston Salem) and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
At exams 2 and 3 (�3 and 4.5 years after study baseline,
respectively), a random subsample of 1959 MESA participants
had PRA and aldosterone levels measured from stored blood
as part of an ancillary study investigating calcified atheroscle-
rosis
of
the
renal
arteries
by
computed
tomography
(Figure S1). Of the participants with aldosterone and PRA
measured, we excluded participants with: no or insufficient
aldosterone sample (n=40); known diabetes mellitus or
missing diabetes mellitus status at the exam of blood draw
(n=334); missing data on follow-up (n=4); and missing data on
important
covariates
(n=11).
The final
analytic
sample
included 1570 participants with aldosterone (602 and 968
participants from exams 2 and 3) and 1474 with PRA
measurements (569 and 905 participants from exams 2 and 3),
respectively. For continuous aldosterone analyses, 22 partic-
ipants with aldosterone below the detectable range were
excluded (n=1548). For this analysis, the baseline visit is the
visit at which both aldosterone and PRA were measured.
Standardized questionnaires were used to obtain partici-
pant data including: demographics, level of education, alcohol
consumption, medical conditions, and current prescription
medication usage. Race/ethnicity was assessed by self-report
and categorized as NHW, black, Hispanic American, or
Chinese American. Education was carried forward from exam
1 and classified as bachelor’s degree versus < bachelor’s
degree. Current alcohol use was assessed as a binary variable
by asking participants if they “presently drink alcoholic
beverages.” Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I)
and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) usage was collected
at the exam of aldosterone and PRA measurement. The MESA
Typical Week Physical Activity Survey, adapted from the
Cross-Cultural Activity Participation Study, was used to
assess physical activity.11 We used the intentional exercise
variable (sum of walking for exercise, sports/dancing, and
conditioning
in
Metabolic
Equivalent
of
Task-minutes/
week).11
Calibrated devices were used to measure participants’
weight, and height with body mass index calculated as weight
(kilograms)/height2 (meters). Waist circumference was mea-
sured at the level of the umbilicus. Resting seated blood
pressure was measured 3 times using a Dinamap automated
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In this contemporary, prospective study of multiethnic
adults without type 2 diabetes mellitus, aldosterone was
positively associated with fasting plasma glucose, insulin
resistance, and risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus over
10.5 years.
• Type 2 diabetes mellitus risk per log-aldosterone standard
deviation was higher among participants with both unsup-
pressed renin phenotype and suppressed renin phenotype
suggesting physiologically, and autonomously higher aldos-
terone may increase risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• Dose-dependent associations of aldosterone with incident
type 2 diabetes mellitus existed in Chinese Americans and
blacks but not in Hispanic Americans or non-Hispanic
whites with the greatest magnitude of association among
Chinese Americans.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Further clarification on the role of aldosterone in the
development of diabetes mellitus and potential racial/ethnic
differences is necessary to optimize risk stratification.
• Elucidation of mechanisms for the racial/ethnic differences
in the association of aldosterone with incident type 2
diabetes mellitus is of preeminent importance given the
potential to lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus through
targeted modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system.

 oscillometric sphygmomanometer (model Pro 100, Critikon,
Tampa, FL); the last 2 measurements were averaged for
analysis.
Laboratory Assessment
Covariates
At visits, fasting (12-hours) blood samples were drawn in
the morning after resting in the sitting position for 1 hour.
Participants were instructed to take their usual medications
before the clinic visit. Samples were processed using a
standardized
protocol
and
sent
to
the
MESA
central
laboratory
at
the
University
of
Vermont
for
further
processing
and
storage.
Participant
samples
were
aliquoted into �65 aliquots per participant, immediately
placed on ice, flash frozen, and stored at �80°C after
processing.
Serum glucose was measured by rate reflectance spec-
trophotometry using thin film adaptation of the glucose
oxidase method on the Vitros analyzer (Johnson & Johnson
Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY). Insulin was determined
using a radioimmunoassay Linco Human Insulin Specific RIA
Kit (Linco Research). The homeostasis model assessment
(HOMA)-2
of
insulin
resistance
(HOMA2-IR)
and
b-cell
function (HOMA2-b) were calculated using the updated
computer-based HOMA index of insulin resistance (HOMA2-
IR) and computer-based HOMA2-b% (https://www.dtu.ox.ac.
uk/homacalculator/).12
Serum creatinine was measured by rate reflectance
spectrophotometry using thin-film adaptation of the creatinine
amidinohydrolase method on the VITROS analyzer (Johnson &
Johnson Clinical Diagnostics) and calibrated to Cleveland
Clinic. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calcu-
lated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collab-
oration (CKD-EPI) equation.13 Adiponectin, leptin, and tumor
necrosis factor-a were measured by Human Serum Adipokine
Panel A and B LINCOplex Kit (Linco Research, Inc., St.
Charles, MO). All assays were performed at the Laboratory for
Clinical
Biochemistry
Research
(University
of
Vermont,
Burlington, VT).
Exposures—PRA and aldosterone
Aldosterone and PRA were measured after 2 and 3 freeze–
thaw cycles, respectively. PRA and aldosterone assays were
run in duplicate and averaged. Aldosterone was measured
using a competition-based radioimmunoassay (ALDOCTK-2;
Diasorin, Stillwater, MN). Intra-assay coefficients of variation
ranged from 6.30% to 8.87%. Angiotensin I levels directly
correlate with PRA. Therefore, PRA was measured using a
radioimmunoassay of generated angiotensin I (GammaCoat
PRA 125 I Kit; DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN). The assay range was
0.05 to 5.0 ng/mL per hour. Intra-assay coefficients of
variation ranged from 18.07% to 21.19%. These assays were
performed
at
the
Laboratory
for
Clinical
Biochemistry
Research (University of Vermont, Burlington, VT).
Outcome—incident type 2 diabetes mellitus
Among those without diabetes mellitus at visit 2 or 3,
participants newly using glucose lowering medication or with
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) at 1 of
the subsequent exams (the last follow-up visit occurring in
2010–2012) were considered to have incident type 2 diabetes
mellitus in accordance with the American Diabetes Associa-
tion definition.14
Statistical Analysis
Due to the non-normal distribution of aldosterone, PRA,
HOMA2-IR, and HOMA2-b, these variables were log trans-
formed before analysis. To explore the potential non-linear
relationships and evaluate for dose-response relationships,
aldosterone, and PRA were divided into tertiles. Descriptive
statistics were used to compare the baseline characteristics
of all included participants by log-aldosterone in tertiles and
included versus excluded participants using one-way ANOVA
for normally distributed continuous variables, Mann-Whitney
and
Kruskal–Wallis
test
for
non-normally
distributed
continuous
variables
and
the
v2
test
for
categorical
variables.
We
used
multivariable
linear
regression
to
examine
the
cross-sectional
associations
between
log-
aldosterone and log-PRA with FPG, log-HOMA2-IR and log-
HOMA2-b. Sequential multivariable adjustment modeling
was performed:
Model 1: age, education, sex, study site, race, alcohol,
physical activity, estimated glomerular filtration rate CKD-
EPI, and systolic blood pressure;
Model 2: Model 1+waist circumference (cm);
Model 3: Model 2+ACE-I and ARB.
The adjustments for waist circumference were performed
because of prior literature demonstrating an association of
aldosterone with adiposity,15 which is independently associ-
ated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.16 ACE-
inhibitors and ARBs modulate the RAAS system and thus were
included in Model 3. Unadjusted type 2 diabetes mellitus
incidence rates for log-aldosterone were calculated using
person-time analysis assuming a Poisson distribution. Partic-
ipants were censored at the last attended follow-up exam or
development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, whichever came
first. Incidence rate ratios were assessed using the Mantel-
Cox method. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to
estimate hazard ratios (HR) associated with the aforemen-
tioned classifications after confirming no significant violations
of the proportional hazards assumption using Schoenfeld

 residuals. Sequential multivariable adjustment modeling was
performed: Model 1 through Model 3 were the same as the
cross-sectional adjustments, Model 4: Model 2+log-PRA for
log-aldosterone
analyses/log-aldosterone
for
log-PRA
analyses. Statistical significance was defined as 2-sided
a<0.05.
To assess the role of adipokines and inflammation in the
aldosterone/PRA-incident type 2 diabetes mellitus associa-
tions, we added to Model 2 and 3 sets of covariates
assessing adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) and inflamma-
tory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP),
interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) or both.
Additionally, we assessed the shape of the association of
aldosterone with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus using cubic
spline regression with knots at the 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentiles of aldosterone to explore potential non-linear
relationships.
Analyses were performed using 3 different exposures with
incident diabetes mellitus as the outcome, to provide insight
into the physiology of aldosterone/renin in the association
with incident diabetes mellitus; first, log-aldosterone:PRA ratio
was set as an exposure as has been performed to test for
primary hyperaldosteronism (a state of autonomous aldos-
terone production).17 Second, participants were classified into
3 categories of PRA of ≤0.50, 0.51 to 0.99, and ≥1.0 lg/L
per hour, to characterize “suppressed renin phenotype (a
state of autonomous aldosterone production),” “indeterminate
renin phenotype,” and “unsuppressed renin phenotype” (a
state of potentially appropriate mineralocorticoid receptor
activation in the setting of physiologic renin-dependent
secretion of aldosterone). The referent category (≥1.0 lg/L
per hour) was compared with the 0.51 to 0.99 and ≤0.50 lg/L
per hour categories for the association with incident diabetes
mellitus.9 Third, participants were classified into 3 categories
of PRA of ≤0.50, 0.51 to 0.99, and ≥1.0 lg/L per hour and
the association of log-aldosterone with incident diabetes
mellitus was assessed among participants in the 3 PRA
classifications.9
Given that the association of aldosterone with type 2
diabetes mellitus risk may differ by age, sex, waist circum-
ference, and race/ethnicity, we tested for interaction of
these factors with log-aldosterone by inserting an interaction
term in the model using unadjusted and Model 1 adjust-
ments. The likelihood ratio test was used to test for
significance, defined as P<0.10 for interactions. The interac-
tions for age, sex, and waist circumference were non-
significant. The interaction of Chinese Americans versus the
other racial/ethnic groups was significant in the continuous
association of log-aldosterone with incident type 2 diabetes
mellitus (P=0.0489 unadjusted and P=0.0885 adjusted)
(Table S1). Analyses were performed using Stata 13.1
(Statacorp, College Station, TX).

Results
The baseline characteristics at visit of aldosterone/renin
measurement for the 1570 participants across tertiles of log
aldosterone are presented in Table 1. Compared with those in
the lowest tertile, participants in higher tertiles of log
aldosterone at baseline had higher diastolic blood pressure,
glucose, HOMA2-IR, HOMA2-b, PRA, interleukin-6, TNF-a,
alcohol use, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, (all
comparisons, P<0.05). Baseline characteristics by race/
ethnicity are presented in Table S2. Blacks had the lowest
aldosterone and PRA levels, whereas NHWs had the highest
aldosterone and PRA levels (P<0.01).
The cross-sectional associations of aldosterone and PRA
with FPG, log HOMA2-IR, and log-HOMA2-b, are summarized
in Table 2. A 100% increase in aldosterone was associated
with a 2.58 mg/dL (0.14 mmol/L) higher FPG (95% confi-
dence interval (CI): 1.69, 3.48), 15% higher HOMA2-IR (95%
CI: 10%, 19%), and a 4% higher HOMA2-b (95% CI: 1%, 7%)
(Model 3). A 100% increase in PRA was associated with a
1.04 mg/dL (0.06 mmol/L) higher FPG (95% CI; 0.61, 1.47),
6% higher HOMA2-IR (95% CI: 4%, 8%) and a 2% higher
HOMA2-b (95% CI: 0%, 3%) (Model 3). The association of log
aldosterone with FPG varied by race/ethnicity (Table S3), a
100% increase in aldosterone was associated with a 3.8 mg/
dL (0.21 mmol/L), 3.2 mg/dL (0.18 mmol/L), 2.3 mg/dL
(0.13 mmol/L) higher FPG among Chinese Americans, blacks,
and NHWs, respectively (all P<0.05) and was non-significant
among Hispanic Americans (Model 3). The association of log
PRA with FPG was only significant among NHWs (b-coefficient
1.31, P<0.01, Model 3) (Table S3).
Longitudinal Assessments
During a median follow-up of 10.5 years, 116 participants
developed type 2 diabetes mellitus (incidence rate 7.9 per
1000 person-years). Incident rates for log-aldosterone were
higher in tertiles 2 and 3 (10.7 and 9.3 per 1000 person-
years) compared with tertile 1 (3.6 per 1000 person-years)
(P<0.01) in Table 3. The HRs for the association of log-
aldosterone and log PRA with incident type 2 diabetes
mellitus are presented in Table 3. After Model 3 adjustment
including waist circumference and ACE-I/ARBs, a 1-SD
increase in log-aldosterone was associated with a 44% higher
risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR 1.44, 95% CI:
1.16, 1.78). Similarly, the second and third tertile of log-

 aldosterone were associated with a 237% (HR 3.37, 95% CI:
1.96, 5.80) and 225% (HR 3.25, 95% CI: 1.86, 5.69) higher
risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus versus tertile 1. These
findings were not attenuated after additional adjustment for
log-PRA (Model 4). Additional adjustment for inflammatory
markers (hsCRP, interleukin-6, and TNF-a) and adipokines
(adiponectin and leptin), mildly attenuated the continuous
association (HR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.66) (Table 4).
In regard to log-PRA (Table 3), after Model 2 adjustments
including waist circumference, a 1-SD increase in log-PRA was
associated with a 27% higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes
mellitus (HR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.54). After Model 2
adjustments, participants in tertile 3 versus tertile 1 had a
72% higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR 1.72,
95% CI: 1.04, 2.84). These findings were attenuated and non-
significant after adjustment for ACE-I/ARB medications and
categorical analyses were non-significant after adjustment for
ACE-I/ARB medications (Model 3).
Formal race/ethnicity interaction testing was significant
for Chinese Americans versus the other racial/ethnic groups
(Table S1). Thus, we proceeded with race/ethnicity stratified
analyses (Table 5), after Model 3 adjustment including waist
circumference
and
ACE-I/ARBs,
a
1-SD
increase
in
log-aldosterone was associated with a HR 2.42 (95% CI:
1.31, 4.46), 1.49 (95% CI: 0.94, 2.36), 1.42 (95% CI: 0.99,
2.03) and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.55) for Chinese Americans,
blacks, NHWs, and Hispanic Americans, respectively. In
categorical analyses, there was a significant graded associ-
ation among Chinese Americans (P=0.011) and blacks
(P=0.008). Tertile 3 compared with 1 was associated with a
HR 12.59 (95% CI: 1.50, 105.55) among Chinese Americans,
HR 3.72 (95% CI: 1.40, 9.91) among blacks and HR 2.93 (95%
CI: 1.03, 8.33) among NHWs (Model 3). These racial/ethnic
findings are concordant with spline data presented in Figure,
revealing dose-dependent linear associations among Chinese
Americans and blacks and non-linear associations among
NHWs and Hispanic Americans.
The association of log-aldosterone by renin phenotypes,
renin phenotypes alone and log-aldosterone:renin ratio with
incident type 2 diabetes mellitus are presented in Table 6.
Participants with PRA ≥1.0 lg/L per hour had a 66% higher

These
findings
remained significant after exclusion of participants taking
ACE-I/ARBs. The association PRA of ≥1.0 lg/L per hour
compared with ≤0.51 to 0.99 and 0.50 lg/L per hour with
incident type 2 diabetes mellitus was non-significant. Addi-
tionally, the association of log-aldosterone/PRA ratio with
incident diabetes mellitus was non-significant.
Discussion
In this contemporary, prospective study of multiethnic adults
without type 2 diabetes mellitus, higher aldosterone and PRA
were associated with higher FPG and insulin resistance at
baseline, along with higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes
mellitus over 10.5 years. The associations of aldosterone with
abnormalities of glucose homeostasis were independent of
known type 2 diabetes mellitus risk factors including age,
socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, physical activity, waist
circumference,
adipokines
(leptin
and
adiponectin)
and
inflammation (hsCRP, interleukin-6, TNF-a). Additionally, PRA
did not modify the association, suggesting that the effects of
aldosterone are independent of not only known type 2
diabetes mellitus risk factors but also PRA. On the contrary,
the association of PRA with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus
was attenuated and became non-significant after adjustment
for ACE-I and ARBs or aldosterone. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
risk was higher per log-aldosterone SD among participants
with both unsuppressed renin phenotype and suppressed
renin phenotype indicating that individuals with physiologi-
cally and autonomously higher aldosterone are both at higher
risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. There were differences in the
magnitude of the associations of aldosterone with type 2
diabetes mellitus across racial/ethnic groups with Chinese
Americans having the strongest associations. In the tertile
and spline analyses, there were dose-dependent associations
of aldosterone with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus in
Chinese Americans and blacks but not in Hispanic Americans
or NHWs, suggesting potential underlying differences in
physiology.
Mechanisms
Preclinical studies suggest that aldosterone induced miner-
alocorticoid
activation
increases
insulin
resistance
and
impairs insulin secretion.2 Aldosterone inhibits insulin signal-
ing and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via glut-4 translo-
cation in adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and vascular smooth
muscle cells, as well as a reduction in adiponectin and
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.3,4 Aldos-
terone impairs b-cell function and insulin secretion, in

 preclinical models through blunted glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion, moreover, in aldosterone synthase deficient mice
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is markedly increased.18
Consistent with these findings, we found higher insulin
resistance and lower compensatory b-cell function with
higher levels of aldosterone, suggesting the inability of the
b-cell to increase compensatory insulin secretion in the face
of higher insulin resistance may be critical in the pathophys-
iology of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In our study, Chinese Americans and blacks had graded
associations of aldosterone with incident type 2 diabetes
mellitus and greater magnitude of associations for Chinese
Americans. There are many plausible mechanisms including
salt-sensitivity, production of aldosterone, receptor binding,
and post-receptor signal transduction in response to aldos-
terone. In the Dahl Salt-Sensitive rat, aldosterone is sup-
pressed acutely in response to salt loads, but aldosterone
becomes paradoxically elevated over time.19 Inappropriate
RAAS activation, combined with the maladaptive inability to
lower aldosterone levels in response to high salt intake
constitute a major issue in all ethnicities, but may be
especially relevant in populations with higher levels of salt-
sensitivity including individuals of Chinese and African
ancestry.20,21 We have previously shown a dose-response
relationship between aldosterone and incident type 2 diabetes
mellitus among blacks.6 In MESA, blacks had the lowest
serum aldosterone compared with the other racial/ethnic
groups, but importantly, the level may be less critical than the
post-receptor signaling cascade evoked by aldosterone.
Concordant with this hypothesis, a study of blacks and NHWs
found lower aldosterone in blacks during childhood and
adulthood, but positive associations of plasma aldosterone
with blood pressure only among blacks.22 Furthermore,
administration of 9-a fludrocortisone (synthetic steroid with
mineralocorticoid receptor activity) increased blood pressure
in blacks but not NHWs.22

 344C in the promoter region and the polymorphism is
associated with higher aldosterone levels.23,24 In a large
population of individuals of Chinese and Japanese ancestry,
CYP11B2 polymorphisms (Arg-173 and T-344C) were associ-
ated with higher FPG levels, higher 2-hour post load glucose,
impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes mellitus,25 which
is consistent with our findings of a high risk of type 2 diabetes
mellitus in Chinese Americans with higher levels of aldosterone.
Additionally, a prospective Japanese cohort study with
10 years of follow-up demonstrated that plasma aldosterone
levels predict the development of insulin resistance,26 sug-
gesting our findings might extend to individuals with ancestry
from the continent of Asia. Thus, genetic differences in
production or response to aldosterone may be responsible for
racial/ethnic differences. Our finding that aldosterone’s asso-
ciation with glucose metabolism is independent of PRA is
consistent with observations made in the pathological state of
primary aldosteronism, which is associated with higher levels of
insulin resistance.3 The treatment of primary aldosteronism
with adrenalectomy or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism
improves insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.27,28 The
largest pharmacologic diabetes mellitus prevention trials
examining RAAS antagonism as a primary end point, the
DREAM (Diabetes Reduction Assessment with Ramipril and
Rosiglitazone Medication) study and the NAVIGATOR (Nateglin-
ide and Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcome
Research) study, both showed modest reductions in risk of
diabetes mellitus with an ACE-I or ARB, which were significant in
NAVIGATOR (14% risk reduction; P<0.0001).29,30 These trials
were majority NHW and the graded associations of aldosterone
with incident diabetes mellitus among blacks and Chinese
Americans but not among NHWs, suggests a potential for
greater risk reduction with modulation of the RAAS system
among blacks and Chinese Americans. Consistent with this
hypothesis, incident diabetes mellitus was analyzed as a
secondary end point in the AASK trial (African American Study
of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Trial) and in the Can-
desartan Antihypertensive Survival Evaluation in Japan (CASE-
J).29,31,32 Among black participants in AASK ramipril (ACE-I)
compared with metoprolol or amlodipine was associated with a
36% reduction (95% CI: 0.45–0.90) in incident diabetes
mellitus.29 Among Japanese participants in CASE-J, candesar-
tan versus placebo was associated with a 36% relative risk
reduction (hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43–0.97; P=0.033) with
similar blood pressure reductions in both groups. When
considered in comparison to the 9% and 14% diabetes mellitus
risk reduction in DREAM and NAVIGATOR, these findings
provide additional support for the possibility of racial/ethnic
differences in the glycemic response to modulation of the RAAS
system. Notably, although these are secondary analyses, the
diabetes mellitus risk reduction of 36% in both the AASK and
CASE-J trials are greater than the 31% diabetes mellitus risk
reduction with metformin in the Diabetes Prevention Program, a
medication currently recommended by national guidelines for
prevention/delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus.33,34
Strengths and Limitations
Our findings should be considered in light of potential
limitations. First, aldosterone and PRA were measured at 1

 point in time, not allowing us to assess changes in
aldosterone and PRA with glucose metabolism. Second, we
did not have a measure of 24-hour urinary sodium in the
cohort and thus were unable to assess the impact of dietary
salt intake. Third, sample sizes varied for the race/ethnic
groups with power implications for detecting significant
racial/ethnic interactions in stratified analyses. Fourth, we
were unable to distinguish between type 1 and type 2
diabetes mellitus, but incident type 1 diabetes mellitus is
extremely uncommon in older adults, so we assume a
predominance of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lastly, we may
have underestimated the relationship of aldosterone with
incident type 2 diabetes mellitus, as individuals with 2-hour
post load glucose impairment or hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%
(48 mmol/mol)
may
have
remained
undetected.
The
strengths of our study include a racial/ethnically diverse
cohort with long-term follow-up. We also have a comprehen-
sive, laboratory- and medication-based documentation of
diabetes mellitus, in addition to data on estimates of insulin
resistance and b-cell function.
Perspectives
In conclusion, our study suggests that higher levels of
aldosterone are associated with insulin resistance and
incident type 2 diabetes mellitus among multiethnic individ-
uals, suggesting pleiotropic effects of aldosterone may be
relevant to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The
greatest magnitude of association
of aldosterone
with
incident type 2 diabetes mellitus was in Chinese Americans
and dose-dependent responses were seen in Chinese Amer-
icans and blacks. Further research to elucidate mechanisms
for the racial/ethnic differences in the association of
aldosterone with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus is of
preeminent importance given the potential to lower risk of
type 2 diabetes mellitus through targeted modulation of the
RAAS system.

Model 2: Model 1 + waist circumference (cm) 
Model 3: Model 2 + angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers 
 
* Linear Regression - a 100% increase in aldosterone or plasma renin activity is associated with an X mg/dL increase in glucose and a 100% 
increase in aldosterone or plasma renin activity results in a 100 times X percent increase in HOMA-IR or HOMA-β, where X equals the β-
coefficient.
