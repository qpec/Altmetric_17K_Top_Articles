In Brief
Lymphocyte trafficking through lymph
nodes and lymph is an important immune
surveillance mechanism of the body.
Druzd et al. (2017) demonstrate that this
trafficking occurs in a circadian manner
and that adaptive immune responses are
also time-of-day dependent and are
ablated when circadian clock function is
lost in T cells.

SUMMARY
Lymphocytes circulate through lymph nodes (LN) in
search for antigen in what is believed to be a contin-
uous process. Here, we show that lymphocyte migra-
tion through lymph nodes and lymph occurred in a
non-continuous,circadianmanner.Lymphocytehom-
ing to lymph nodes peaked at night onset, with cells
leaving the tissue during the day. This resulted in
strong oscillations in lymphocyte cellularity in lymph
nodes andefferentlymphatic fluid. Usinglineage-spe-
cific genetic ablation of circadian clock function, we
demonstrated this to be dependent on rhythmic
expression of promigratory factors on lymphocytes.
Dendritic cell numbers peaked in phase with lympho-
cytes, with diurnal oscillations being present in dis-
ease severity after immunization to induce experi-
mental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These
rhythms were abolished by genetic disruption of
T cell clocks, demonstrating a circadian regulation of
lymphocyte migration through lymph nodes with
time-of-day of immunization beingcritical for adaptive
immune responses weeks later.
INTRODUCTION
Lymphocytes survey antigen by circulating through blood, lymph
nodes (LNs) and lymph and shape specific immune responses in
LNs. To enter LNs, lymphocytes must undergo extensive inter-
actions with high endothelial cell venules (HEVs) (Butcher,
1991; Fo
¨ rster et al., 2008; Ley et al., 2007; Muller, 2011; Springer,
1994; Vestweber and Blanks, 1999; von Andrian and Mempel,
2003; Wagner and Frenette, 2008). Lymphocytes initially tether
on peripheral nodal addressin (PNAd) expressed on HEVs using
L-selectin (CD62L) as a ligand. Lymphocytes roll along the
vascular endothelium and become activated via interactions of
the chemokine receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 with their respective
ligands CCL21 and CXCL12. Activated leukocytes use the integ-
rin LFA-1 (CD11a) to bind to ICAM-1 to promote adhesion and
finally emigrate into the LN parenchyma.
After LN entry, lymphocytes interact with dendritic cells in
order to scan presented antigen (Gasteiger et al., 2016), and
finally emigrate into efferent lymphatic vessels. For this
egress, expression of the sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor
1 (S1P1, encoded by S1pr1) on lymphocytes is critical, recog-
nizing the chemoattractant phospholipid sphingosine-1-phos-
phate (S1P) (Matloubian et al., 2004). S1P concentrations are
high in blood and lymph but low in tissues, thus providing a
gradient that guides lymphocytes out of the LN and into
efferent lymph (Cyster and Schwab, 2012). This mechanism
is therapeutically exploited for treating multiple sclerosis pa-
tients by antagonizing S1P1 function with the drug FTY720
(fingolimod) to keep autoreactive T cells from exiting LNs
and entering the central nervous system (Massberg and von
Andrian, 2006).
Lymphocyte trafficking into LNs is believed to occur in a
continuous fashion, and not to be influenced by time-of-day vari-
ables. Moreover, it is generally unclear whether circadian
rhythms regulate overall cellularity in these tissues (Arjona and
Sarkar, 2005; Esquifino et al., 1996; Fortier et al., 2011; Hemmers
and Rudensky, 2015).

 Circadian rhythms are important drivers for most physiological
processes as they align the body with rhythmically occurring
daily changes in the environment (Dibner et al., 2010). They nor-
mally rely on an intricate interplay of cell-intrinsic clock genes
driving circadian responses (Mohawk et al., 2012). Daily oscilla-
tions of lymphocyte counts in blood have been described (Arjona
et al., 2012; Curtis et al., 2014; Haus and Smolensky, 1999; Lab-
recque and Cermakian, 2015; Scheiermann et al., 2013) and
cells of the adaptive immune system such as T and B cells, as
well as dendritic cells, possess the components of the molecular
clock machinery (Bollinger et al., 2011; Hemmers and Rudensky,
2015; Silver et al., 2012a). In contrast to monocytes of the innate
immune system (Nguyen et al., 2013), however, the functional
relevance of these cell-intrinsic oscillations for lymphocytes is
unclear (Hemmers and Rudensky, 2015). Stimulated by previous
findings, which described periodic oscillations in innate immune
cell function (Gibbs et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2013; Scheier-
mann et al., 2012) and T helper-17 (Th17) cell differentiation
(Yu et al., 2013), we postulated that the migration of lymphocytes
through murine LNs might be regulated in a circadian manner
with direct relevance for the mounting of adaptive immune
responses.
RESULTS
Lymphocyte Numbers Exhibit Circadian Oscillations in
Lymph Nodes
In contrast to circulating blood lymphocyte numbers, which peak
during the day in mice around Zeitgeber time (ZT) 5 (i.e., 5 hr after
light onset) (Figure 1A), numbers for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as
well as B cells showed delayed oscillations (by �8 hr) in inguinal
lymph nodes (iLNs), with highest counts occurring at the begin-
ning of the dark phase (ZT13, i.e., 1 hr after lights off) (Figure 1A).
These rhythms were consistently observed for naive and central
memory T cells, demonstrating a broad phenomenon also
affecting T lymphocyte subpopulations (Figures S1A–S1C). Os-
cillations were not only observed in the rhythmic environment
represented by 12 hr light:12 hr dark conditions (LD) but were
sustained in constant darkness (dark:dark, DD), indicating their
bona fide endogenous circadian nature (Figure 1B). Light expo-
sure was an important entrainment factor, since rhythms were in-
verted when the light regime was reversed (DL) (Figure 1B).
Rhythms were furthermore detected across various types
of LNs (Figure 1C and Figures S1D–S1F), indicating a relevant
phenomenon across the LN compartment. To investigate the

 underlying mechanisms driving these oscillations, we focused
on the cellular LN input and output pathways by blocking
lymphocyte homing or egress, both critical determinants of LN
cellularity (Lo et al., 2005). Blocking homing with anti-integrin an-
tibodies dramatically decreased LN cellularity over 24 hr while
blocking lymphocyte egress with FTY720 increased LN cellu-
larity over the same time frame, confirming the temporally highly
dynamic cellular nature of this tissue (Figures 1D and 1E). Both
treatments ablated rhythmicity, indicating that lymphocyte hom-
ing and egress—but not intranodal proliferation (Figures S1G
and S1H)—were the central determinants of circadian oscillatory
cellularity. These data demonstrate a striking circadian oscilla-
tion in lymph node cellularity, peaking at night onset.
Lymphocyte Homing Is Dependent on Oscillations in
Lymphocytes and Microenvironment
We next used adoptive transfer techniques to determine whether
lymphocyte homing to the LN was occurring in a rhythmic
manner. LN infiltration of lymphocyte subpopulations peaked
around night onset and remained low during the day (Figure 2A).
To define whether oscillations were determined by lymphocyte-
intrinsic and/or microenvironmental signals, we adoptively
transferred cells harvested at ZT5 (‘‘day’’) or ZT13 (‘‘night’’) into
LD-entrained recipients at either ZT5 or ZT13. While ‘‘day’’ (cells)
into ‘‘day’’ (recipient) transfers exhibited the lowest homing ca-
pacity and ‘‘night’’ into ‘‘night’’ transfers the highest, a mixed
contribution of both lymphocyte and microenvironment timing
was observed in the ‘‘day’’ into ‘‘night’’ and ‘‘night’’ into ‘‘day’’
chimeras (Figure 2B). A screen for oscillations of promigratory
factors on T and B cells revealed that expression of the chemo-
kine receptor CCR7 exhibited rhythmicity peaking at ZT13
(Figure 2C) while the adhesion molecules CXCR4, CD11a, and
L-selectin showed either no oscillations or not for all lymphocyte
subpopulations (Figures S2A and S2B). In addition, expression
analyses of whole lymph node mRNA and extracellular protein
on HEVs revealed oscillatory amounts of the chemokine
CCL21, a ligand for CCR7—but not CXCL12 (not shown)—being
high around night onset (Figures 2D and 2E). HEVs also exhibited
rhythmic expression of ICAM-1 but not of PNAd (Figures S2C
and S2D). Oscillations in lymphocyte chemokine receptors
were critical for rhythmic homing because a titrated, short pre-
treatment of adoptively transferred cells with pertussis toxin
(PTX) (Lo et al., 2005), an inhibitor of chemokine receptor
signaling, ablated rhythmicity (Figure 2F). To investigate the
involvement of CCR7 in this process, we analyzed total lymph
node cellularity of CCR7-deficient mice, as well as the rhythmic
homing capacity of isolated CCR7-deficient cells. Ccr7�/� mice
exhibited no oscillations in lymph node cell counts while also ex-
hibiting the expected lower overall numbers (Fo
¨ rster et al., 1999)
(Figure 2G). In addition, Ccr7�/� cells failed to show rhythmic
lymph node homing (Figure 2H). These data demonstrated that
lymphocyte recruitment to LNs is determined by rhythms in leu-
kocytes and the microenvironment, along with in-phase expres-
sion of the CCR7-CCL21 receptor-ligand axis.
Circadian Clocks Control Cellular Oscillations in
Lymph Nodes
LNs exhibit oscillations of clock genes (Figure 3A), prompting
us to investigate the role of lymphocyte clocks in their migra-
tory behavior. We generated mice in which the core clock
gene Bmal1 (also known as Arntl) was deleted in T cells
(Bmal1flox/floxxCd4-cre) or B cells (Bmal1flox/floxxCd19-cre) (Fig-
ure 3B and Figures S2E and S2F). Remarkably, loss of lymphocyte
BMAL1 ablated the overall rhythmicity of T and B cell numbers in
lymph nodes (Figure 3C and Figure S2G). In addition, rhythmic
homingofBmal1flox/floxxCd4-creT cellsintoWTrecipientswas ab-
lated (Figure 3D). In agreement with these findings, rhythmic
expression of CCR7 surface protein (Figure 3E) and mRNA (Fig-
ure 3F) was absent in BMAL1-deficient CD4+ T cells, indicating
the regulation of the molecule at the transcriptional level by the
circadian clock. Together, these data provide evidence for a func-
tional role of cell-autonomous clocks in lymphocyte migration.
Lymphatic Egress from Lymph Nodes Is under Circadian
Control
Because our data indicated that, in addition to a rhythmic homing
component, lymphocyte egress might counterbalance LN oscilla-
tions (Figures 1D and 1E), we quantified lymphocyte numbers in
lymph fluid by cannulating efferent lymphatic vessels. Prominent
rhythms in cellular counts were detected, peaking at ZT9 and
exhibiting a low at ZT21 (Figure 4A). These oscillations were
observed for different lymphocyte populations (Figure 4A and Fig-
ures S2H and S2I) and were bona fide circadian in nature as they
persisted in constant darkness (Figure 4B). Rhythms were not due
to higher lymph volume or flow rates at different times of the day
(Figure S2J). To verify whether oscillations in lymph cellularity
were truly attributable to rhythmic egress and not secondary to
rhythmic input into LNs (Figure 2A), we transferred lymphocytes
at different times of the day, blocked subsequent LN entry and
quantified their transit through the LN into lymph over time (Mandl
etal.,2012).AhigherLNretentioncapacityofcellsinjectedatZT13
was observed compared to ZT5 and a less rapid accumulation of
cells in lymph (Figures 4C and 4D and Figure S3), demonstrating
lymphocyte egress to be highly rhythmic. This effect resulted in
longer LN half-lives of cells injected at ZT13 (CD4: 12 hr, CD8:
12 hr, B cells: 16 hr) compared to ZT5 (CD4: 9 hr, CD8: 9 hr, B cells:
13.5 hr) (Figures 4C and 4D and Figure S3). T- and B cell-specific
BMAL1-deletion ablated oscillations in lymph, indicating the
importance ofcell-autonomous clocks also for lymphocyte egress
(Figure 4E and data not shown). Of importance, adoptively trans-
ferred BMAL1-deficient CD4+ T cells exhibited notime-of-day var-
iations in their LN half-life (Figure 4F), demonstrating the relevance
of T cell clocks in their rhythmic trafficking behavior.
Using a mathematical approach, we assessed whether oscil-
latory LN counts could be modeled with only either homing or
egress to be rhythmic or whether both components needed to
oscillate. Although oscillations were also observed when only
one component was rhythmic, the best fit was achieved when
both homing and egress were assumed to oscillate, thus sup-
porting our experimental data (Figure 4G and Figure S4). In sum-
mary, lymphocyte clocks and the time-of-day entry of cells into
LNs have functional consequences for LN transit and egress
into lymph.
Rhythmic Lymphocyte Egress Depends on Oscillatory
S1pr1 Expression
S1P-receptors are critical in regulating lymph node egress
(Cyster and Schwab, 2012). We therefore investigated whether
122
Immunity 46, 120–132, January 17, 2017
 expression of S1P-receptor family members exhibited oscilla-
tions using quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). All S1P receptors exhibited
robust diurnal oscillations peaking between ZT1 and ZT9 (Fig-
ure 5A and Figure S5A), which coincided with high lymphocyte
egress. In addition, FTY720, as well as the S1P1-specific func-
tional antagonist SEW2871 strongly down-modulated lymphatic

 egress in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Figures
5B and 5C and Figure S5B). The observation that FTY720-treated
animals exhibited reduced but still rhythmic lymph cellularity indi-
cated a daytime-sensitive role for S1P1 in mediating lymphocyte
exit. Rhythmic expression of S1pr1 was ablated in BMAL1-defi-
cient CD4+ T cells, pointing toward a regulation of the gene by
the circadian clock (Figure 5D). To investigate this in more detail,
we performed an in vitro assay, in which the promoter region of
S1pr1 was cloned in front of the luciferase (luc) reporter gene.
Luciferase activity in HEK293 cells transfected with the S1pr1-
luc reporter was decreased after co-transfection of increasing
amounts of Bmal1 and Clock expression plasmids (Figure 5E).
This demonstrated that expression of S1pr1 is regulated by
BMAL1 and CLOCK.
To confirm the role of S1P1 in the time-of-day-dependent
egress genetically, we generated T cell-specific mice that
were heterozygous for S1pr1 in order not to completely
block lymphocyte egress (Matloubian et al., 2004) but to titrate
S1P1 amounts, as loss of one allele had been demonstrated to
result in haploinsufficiency (Lo et al., 2005). S1pr1+/floxxCd4-cre
mice exhibited no more oscillations in LN counts and altered
lymph rhythmicity, demonstrating the importance of S1P1 in
the proper timing of lymphocyte egress (Figures 5F and 5G
and Figure S5C). Importantly, no diurnal oscillations were
observed in amounts of S1P in efferent lymph (Figure 5H) or in
S1P synthesizing or degrading enzymes in lymph node (Fig-
ure S5D), suggesting that oscillatory expression of the receptor
(S1P1) and not its ligand (S1P) was the driver for rhythmic
lymphocyte egress. Together, these data demonstrate a critical
role for S1P1 in mediating circadian lymphocyte egress from
lymph nodes into efferent lymph.
Relevance of Circadian Oscillations in Lymph Node
Cellularity
We hypothesized that oscillatory lymphocyte counts in LNs
might have functional consequences in a potential time-of-day
dependence of adaptive immune responses. We therefore
tested whether the activation status of lymphocytes in LNs var-
ied over the course of the day. More activated T cells were pre-
sent in LNs at night onset as assessed by CD69 staining, coin-
ciding with higher overall lymphocyte counts at this time
(Figure 6A). Because dendritic cells (DCs) are key antigen-pre-
senting cells critical in the activation of lymphocytes and the gen-
eration of adaptive immune responses (Girard et al., 2012), we

 next investigated whether these cells also exhibited oscillatory
LN counts. Migratory DC cellularity showed strong oscillations
peaking in phase with lymphocytes (Figure 6B and Figure S6A).
These data point to the existence of a concerted circadian
migration pattern of antigen-bearing (DCs) and antigen-recog-
nizing (T cells) cells in LNs.
Recent evidence indicates that the immune system can
respond to challenges in a rhythmic fashion (Fortier et al.,
2011; Gibbs et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2013; Scheiermann
et al., 2012; Silver et al., 2012b). We therefore investigated
the pathophysiological significance of circadian oscillatory
LN counts in the autoimmunity model of EAE. Mice immunized
during the late light phase (ZT8, when cell counts are high in
LNs, Figures 1A and 1C) showed a dramatically accelerated
disease progression 2 weeks later, with higher clinical scores
compared to late night-immunized animals (ZT20, when LN
counts trough) (Figure 6C). Differences in disease scores
were associated with higher immune cell infiltration and demy-
elination in the spinal cord at the peak of the disease (Figures
6D and 6E). We detected elevated interleukin-2 (Il2) mRNA
amounts (Figure 6F) and a higher number of IL-17 producing
as well as very-late antigen (VLA)-4 integrin positive CD4+

 T cells in LNs of ZT8-immunized mice, subtypes that have
been shown to be critical for the induction of EAE (Kawakami
et al., 2012) (Figure 6G). This indicated that circadian regula-
tion of immunization occurred at a very early phase of the pro-
cess when T cells are activated in draining lymph nodes (Fig-
ure S6B). Two days after induction of EAE, an increase of both
naive and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was detected in
draining lymph nodes of ZT8-immunized animals, while in
ZT20-immunized animals T cell numbers remained relatively
low (Figures 6H–6J and Figure S6C). Thus, oscillations in the
numbers of CD4+ T cells in lymph nodes during initial
encounter with antigen appear to be pivotal for the severity
of EAE. To investigate whether T cell autonomous clocks regu-
late this response, we genetically deleted T cell circadian
clock function. Although in control animals disease develop-
ment depended on the time of immunization, in T cell specific
Bmal1�/� mice it did not (Figure 6K). Two days after immuni-
zation, total and T cell counts in draining lymph nodes were
different at ZT15 between day- and night-immunized control,
but not in T cell specific Bmal1�/� mice (Figure 6L and Fig-
ure S6D). Hence, T cell clocks determine time-of-day function
and, after challenge, development of autoimmune sequelae.
We finally investigated whether adaptive immune responses
to pathogens exhibited similar circadian rhythmicity. Mice
were infected with the gastric bacterial pathogen Helicobacter
pylori at three different time points during the day, and lymph
node counts were quantified 3 weeks later. Also in this chronic
infection model, LN counts showed strong circadian respon-
siveness to the initial infection with highest numbers present
at ZT7, analogous to the EAE immunization experiments (Fig-
ure S6E). In addition, acute viral infection with influenza A virus
led to stronger pulmonary infiltration of CD8+IFN-g+ T cells
when animals were infected at ZT8 compared to ZT20,
8 days post infection (Figure S6F). Together, these data
strongly indicate that immunization reactions and the adaptive
immune responses to various pathogens follow a circadian
rhythm (Figure 6M and Movie S1).
DISCUSSION
We have described here the mechanisms that govern a circadian
rhythmicity in the capacity of lymphocytes to enter and exit
lymph nodes, which depend on cell-autonomous, clock-gene-
controlled expression of promigratory factors. Lymphocytes
entered LNs most prominently at the onset of the night phase
and egressed from the tissue during the day. This resulted in
oscillatory cell counts in lymph nodes and lymph and time-of-
day differences in the adaptive immune response weeks after
immunization. In addition, DCs were found to be present in LN
in highest numbers around night onset, peaking in phase with
the lymphocyte populations. Our data reveal that T cell-autono-
mous circadian oscillations are critical in regulating adaptive
immunity.
It is surprising to note that lymph nodes exhibit circadian differ-
ences in their cellularity, given that they represent such a central
tissue of the immune system and, accordingly, have thus been
intensely studied. Since we observed oscillations in all investi-
gated lymph nodes, the phenomenon appears to be broad and
robust and not restricted to specific body locations. It is note-
worthy that other lymphoid organs such as the thymus (data
not shown) and the bone marrow do not exhibit overt circadian
oscillations in absolute numbers. At least the latter, however, still
displays circadian activity in cellular trafficking as hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are mobilized into blood (Lu-
cas et al., 2008; Me
´ ndez-Ferrer et al., 2008) and recruited back
into the bone marrow (Scheiermann et al., 2012) at different
times. The fraction of mobilized and homed cells might be small
compared with the overall numbers, though, which might explain
why overt oscillations of total cells in the BM are not observed. In
contrast to the BM, lymph node total cellularity is highly dynamic
over 24 hr, as seen when homing or egress is blocked. Still, hom-
ing of leukocytes to lymph nodes and bone marrow occurs pre-
dominantly at night, while egress (or mobilization in the case of
the bone marrow) occurs predominantly during the day. Thus,
rhythmic egress of lymphocytes via efferent lymph is a major
mechanism underlying the oscillatory leukocyte numbers in
blood. Whether other egress routes for lymphocytes, from the
thymus or the spleen, occur in a circadian manner is currently
unclear.
Our data point to a critical role of cell-intrinsic clock-depen-
dent mechanisms in the regulation of T and B lymphocyte traf-
ficking. While global BMAL1 deficiency results in a diverse array
of phenotypes (Bunger et al., 2000), such as altered B cell
numbers (Sun et al., 2006), few studies have focused on cell-
type specific deletion of BMAL1 in the immune system. Line-
age-specific ablation of BMAL1 in myeloid cells results in a
pro-inflammatory state (Nguyen et al., 2013), yet a similar
approach targeting lymphocytes yielded no obvious phenotype
(Hemmers and Rudensky, 2015). The latter finding might be
due to mice with clock-deficient lymphocytes exhibiting pheno-
types only at specific times, so that only when tested over mul-
tiple time points across the day can alterations be detected.

 Our data showing that lack of BMAL1 in T cells ablated oscilla-
tions in EAE disease scores indicates an important role for
T cell clocks in the adaptive immune response. This is in line
with a previous observation that T cells harvested from Clock
mutant mice exhibited altered proliferation responses at specific
times (Fortier et al., 2011).
We demonstrated the critical regulators of lymphocyte traf-
ficking, Ccr7 and S1pr1, to be under circadian control. Ccr7
and S1pr1 oscillations showed opposite phases, being high in
the evening for the former and high during the day for the latter.
This agrees with the additional role of CCR7 as a retention factor
for T cells in lymph nodes that can antagonize S1P1 function
(Pham et al., 2008). In addition, more T cells expressed the acti-
vation marker CD69 at night onset, a negative regulator of S1P1
(Shiow et al., 2006). These inverted oscillations of retention and
egress factors appeared to be responsible for keeping lympho-
cytes retained in the node at night and promoting daytime
egress. In addition to these lymphocyte intrinsic signals, the
microenvironmental fluctuation of CCL21 indicated an additional
rhythmic component that was non cell-autonomous. Whether
direct autonomic innervation governs these oscillations—as
has been shown for the bone marrow and skeletal muscle (Me
´ n-
dez-Ferrer et al., 2008; Scheiermann et al., 2012)—and/or hu-
moral factors as has been shown for the lung (Gibbs et al.,
2014), is outside the scope of this manuscript and should be
investigated in the future.
Lymph nodes act as the body’s immunological sieve,
capturing lymph-borne antigens and antigen-presenting cells
(APCs) and bringing these components in close contact with
lymphocytes. Our data show that not only T cells migrate to
the lymph node in a circadian manner but that also dendritic
cells, the major APCs, are present more prominently around
night onset, peaking at the same time as lymphocytes. Both
cell types need to interact to produce a functional adaptive im-
mune response (Gasteiger et al., 2016). It therefore appears likely
that having them present at the same time in the confined envi-
ronment of the lymph node enhances the likelihood of antigen
encounter by the very few specific T cell clones, as opposed to
cells entering and exiting at random times. This process of
more effective cellular interactions appears to be further helped
by the fact that during the night fewer cells exit the tissue than
during the day, thus giving APC-T cell pairs more time to interact
functionally. Whether also antigen encounter with APCs at pe-
ripheral surfaces is occurring in a rhythmic manner, which could
ultimately be driving a circadian migratory DC process, should
be the subject of future investigations.
Compared to the immediate response of the innate immune
system, which is under circadian control (Gibbs et al., 2014; Kel-
ler et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2013; Scheiermann et al., 2012), it
is remarkable that also the adaptive immune system appears to
be temporally regulated, because these responses take much
longer to be mounted. How can the time-of-day dependent dif-
ferences encountered during the initial stimulus be preserved
to exhibit circadian gating of immune responses weeks later? It
appears that the initial hours in the generation of the adaptive im-
mune response and the number of cells present in the lymph
node are critical in regulating the strength of the response
(Moon et al., 2007), which cannot be compensated for by the
next circadian cycle.
In steady state, critical factors of the immune system oscillate
in mice and humans with opposite phases according to their in-
verted rest-activity times (Arjona et al., 2012; Curtis et al., 2014;
Labrecque and Cermakian, 2015; Scheiermann et al., 2013).
Circulating leukocyte counts are high during the respective
resting phases, which occur during the day in mice and at night
in humans. In addition, also under stimulated conditions timing
matters, as administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating fac-
tor (G-CSF) to patients in order to mobilize hematopoietic stem
cells from bone marrow into blood yields higher numbers at
different times than in mice (Lucas et al., 2008). These data sug-
gest that also adaptive immune responses in humans could be
under circadian control. Since in our EAE model, immunization
close to the onset of the activity phase produced a higher im-
mune response in mice, in humans the early morning hours
should produce a higher adaptive immune reactivity. Indeed,
this appears to be the case as recent studies have unveiled
that administration of hepatitis A (Phillips et al., 2008) and flu vac-
cines (Long et al., 2016) in the morning yielded highest antibody
titers compared to other times. Together, our data provide
mechanistic insights for a time-of-day difference in lymphocyte
trafficking and adaptive immune responses, thus warranting
further investigations into time-of-day optimization of immune
therapies and vaccination programs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Cd4cre, Lckcre, Cd19cre, Bmal1flox/flox, and S1pr1flox/flox mice were obtained
from Jackson Laboratories and crossbred to target T cells and B cells, respec-
tively. Ccr7�/� mice were a gift from Reinhold Fo
¨ rster. 7- to 8-week-old wild-
type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River and Janvier. Mice were
housed under a 12 hr:12 hr light-dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. To
induce changes in light regime, we placed mice in a light cycler (Park Bio-
services) with a 12 hr-inverted light cycle for a minimum of 2 weeks to
completely establish an inverse light cycle or kept in constant darkness. All an-
imal experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the German
Law of Animal Welfare and approved by the Regierung of Oberbayern or the
ethics committee of the Schleswig-Holstein State Ministry of Energy, Agricul-
ture, Environment and Rural Areas.
Flow Cytometry
Blood was collected into EDTA-coated capillary tubes (Microvete 300). Counts
were obtained using an IDEXX ProCyte DX cell counter or a Hemavet Hema-
tology Analyzer 950FS (Drew Scientific). Erythrocytes were lysed by incubation
in 0.8% NH4Cl. Lymph was collected as described below. Spleens, lymph no-
des, or thymi were harvested from animals and processed through a cell
strainer (40–70 mM pore size) and resuspended in PBS. For quantification of
dendritic cells, lymph nodes were first chopped into small pieces and incu-
bated in collagenase IV (1 mg/ml, C5138, Sigma) and DNase I (0.2 mg/ml,
Roche) for 30 min at 37�C with gentle agitation. Following digestion, cells
were passed through a 40 mm strainer and resuspended in PBS supplemented
with 2% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO). A 20 min blocking step using anti-CD16/
32 antibody (2.4G2; BD Biosciences) was performed on ice prior to fluorescent
staining. Single-cell suspensions were stained with fluorescence-conjugated
antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Gallios Flow Cytometer
(Beckman Coulter) or a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Prior
to staining of intracellular cytokines, cells were restimulated for 5 hr with
PMA and ionomycine (cell stimulation cocktail with protein transport inhibitors,
eBioscience). Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Adoptive Transfer Studies
Lymphocytes from spleen and peripheral lymph nodes (ratio 80:20) were
labeled with 1.5 mM of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE,
Immunity 46, 120–132, January 17, 2017
129
 Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 2.5 mM CellTracker Red CMTPX (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 2 mM EDTA for 20 min at 37�C
and washed 4 times. 20 3 106 cells were then injected i.v. into recipient
mice. In some experiments, lymph node entry was blocked two and
12 hr later by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 100 mg anti-aL
(CD11a, clone M17/4; BioXCell) and anti-a4 (CD49d, clone PS/2; BioXCell)
integrin antibodies in PBS. In some experiments, cells were pre-incubated
with a 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) pulse of 10 min at 37�C and washed
4 times before injection together with control-treated cells (Lo et al., 2005).
The subsets of adoptively transferred cells in the recipient mice were
analyzed via flow cytometry. Dyes were switched to avoid dye-specific
effects.
S1pr1 Promoter Luciferase Reporter Assay
The S1pr1-Gaussia Luciferase (S1pr1-GLuc) GLuc-ON promoter clone
containing a �1 kb fragment upstream of the transcription start site and
a �0.3 kb fragment of the exon 1 of murine S1pr1 in pEZX-PG04 vector
(also containing a constitutively expressed secreted alkaline phosphatase
(SEAP) secondary reporter as an internal control) was obtained from Gen-
eCopoeia. HEK293AAV cells (Cellbiolabs) were plated onto 96-well plates
and maintained in DMEM with 2 mM stable glutamine supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10,000 U penicillin/streptomycin at
37�C with 5% CO2. Upon 80%–90% confluence, cells were transfected
with the following expression plasmids: 20 ng S1pr1-luc with various com-
binations of the following clock gene constructs: HA-Clock, HA-Bmal1, and
pcDNA3.1 (mock transfection) as indicated per well using Lipofectamine
3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol. Medium was changed once on the next day and was
collected for measurement 48 hr after transfection. The secreted GLuc and
SEAP activities were measured with the Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence
Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia) according to the manufacturer’s protocol using
the Berthold TriStar LB 941 plate reader (Berthold Technologies). Normal-
ized promoter activity was calculated as the ratio of GLuc to SEAP
activities.
Lymph Cannulation
40 min prior to cannulation, 200 ml olive oil was administered intragastrally to
identify mesenteric lymph vessels that are located just upstream of the
thoracic duct. Mice were anesthetized (100 mg/kg ketamine, 20 mg/kg xyla-
zine, 1% acepromazin i.p.), vessels were cannulated and lymph was drawn
via a fine bore polythene tubing (Smiths Medical) that had previously been
flushed with PBS containing EDTA. In some experiments, mice were injected
i.p. with 1 mg/kg (or less) of FTY720 or 10 mg/kg of SEW2871 1 or 2 hours,
respectively, before cannulation. Cell numbers were determined using an
IDEXX ProCyte DX cell counter.
Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative Imaging Analysis
Harvested lymph nodes were embedded in OCT (TissueTec), frozen and
sectioned with a thickness of 10 mm on a cryostat (Leica). Sections were
fixed in methanol or left unfixed, incubated with fluorescently coupled anti-
bodies and imaged on an Axio Examiner.D1 microscope (Zeiss) equipped
with LEDs of 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 642 nm excitation wavelengths
or equipped with a 4-color laser stack and a confocal spinning-disk head
(Intelligent Imaging Innovations). For investigations of protein expression
in HEVs, all quantifications were performed using mask analysis (Zeiss soft-
ware) based on PECAM-1 expression and quantifying expression of other
fluorescent channels within the mask containing PECAM+-pixels delin-
eating
HEV vascular structures as
previously detailed (Scheiermann
et al., 2012).
EAE Induction
For EAE induction the MOG35-55-CFA Emulsion PTX Kit (EK-2110, Hooke
Labs) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mice were anesthe-
tized (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine i.p.) and bilaterally s.c. in-
jected with 200 mg myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35–55 in
200 mL Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) at the indicated time points, fol-
lowed by two i.p. injections of 200 ng pertussis toxin (PTX) in phosphate buff-
ered saline (PBS), immediately after immunization and 24 hr later. From day 8
on, paralysis was assessed using the clinical scoring system: 0, no obvious
signs of disease; 0.5, distal paralysis of the tail; 1, complete tail paralysis;
1.5, mild paresis of one or both hind legs; 2, severe paresis of both hind
legs; 2.5, complete paralysis of one hind leg; 3, complete paralysis of both
hind legs; 3.5, complete paralysis of hind legs and paresis of one front leg. An-
imals with scores of 2 and up were provided access to food and water on the
bottom of the cage.
T and B Cell Isolation
CD4+ T cells for Q-PCR analysis were purified from lymph nodes of
C57BL/6 WT, 3 S1pr1+/floxxCd4-cre, Bmal1flox/floxxCd4-cre or littermate
control mice using the EasySep Mouse CD4+ T cell enrichment kit (Stem-
Cell Technologies). Purity was confirmed via flow cytometry and was
generally > 96%. B220+ B cells for western blot analysis were purified
from spleens of Bmal1flox/floxxCd19-cre or littermate control mice using
the EasySep Mouse B cell enrichment kit (StemCell Technologies). The
Pan T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) was used to purify total T cells
from mouse splenocytes. Splenocytes were labeled with a mixture of
biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies directed against cells other
than T cells and followed by conjugate binding with anti-biotin microbe-
ads. Magnetically labeled non-T cells were depleted with autoMACS
(Miltenyi Biotec) and the negative fraction was collected, yielding an
average 90% purity of (CD3+) T cells.

Statistical Analyses
All data are represented as mean ± SEM. Comparisons between two samples
were performed using the paired and unpaired Student’s t tests or Mann-Whit-
ney test. One-way ANOVA analyses followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison
test, two-way ANOVA analyses followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test were
used for multiple group comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed
with GraphPad Prism 6 software. Statistical significance was assessed as
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.
