Innate immunity is a key component in the pathogenesis of oral mucositis, a universal toxicity of chemoradiation
therapy (CRT). Dusquetide, a novel Innate Defense Regulator, has demonstrated both nonclinical and clinical
efficacy in ameliorating severe oral mucositis (SOM). Long term follow-up studies from the Phase 2 clinical study
evaluating dusquetide as a treatment for SOM in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients receiving CRT have now
been completed. Extended analysis indicates that dusquetide therapy was well-tolerated and did not contribute
to increased infection, tumor growth or mortality. Potential ancillary benefits of duquetide therapy were also
identified.
1. Introduction
Interim results from a Phase 2 study evaluating a dose of 1.5 mg/kg
of dusquetide as a treatment for severe oral mucositis (SOM) in head
and neck cancer (HNC) patients receiving chemoradiation therapy
(CRT) demonstrated a 50% decrease in the median duration of severe
oral mucositis (SOM) in patients receiving at least 55 Gy irradiation [1].
Patients at higher risk for SOM showed even greater improvements
(67%) relative to placebo, particularly in the treatment group receiving
the 1.5 mg/kg dose of dusquetide [1]. Over this same treatment period,
an increased number of patient classified as having a “complete tumor
response” using the RECIST 1.1 tumor status system and a decreased
“non-fungal” (i.e. bacterial) infection rate were also observed. Long
term follow-up visits were conducted on these same patients for 12
months after the completion of CRT, with the last visits occurring in the
fall of 2016.
There are no treatments for SOM approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for use in HNC or other cancers with solid
tissue tumors. In the case of hematologic tumors, there is only one
approved therapy (palifermin), a tissue growth factor which pre-
sumably encourages the growth and regrowth of the oral mucosa tissue.
Palifermin is specifically approved for use in patients receiving hema-
topoietic stem cell support for a myelotoxic therapy of a hematologic
cancer which lack the receptor for the growth factor [2,3]. Due to its
function as a tissue growth factor, palifermin is associated with a po-
tential risk of stimulating/encouraging solid tumor proliferation [4–6]

MARK
 and is therefore contra-indicated in the case of solid tumors, all of
which express the growth factor receptor. Other treatment approaches
are under development [7,8] but none have been approved and the risk
of interfering with tumor treatment or encouraging tumor growth re-
mains a primary concern [9].
Innate immunity is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of
oral mucositis [10–13] and indeed the efficacy of dusquetide as an
Innate Defense Regulator supports this understanding [14,15,1]. Dus-
quetide (SGX942) is a first-in-class Innate Defense Regulator (IDR) that
modulates the innate immune response downstream of most innate
immune receptors, acting at a key adaptor protein known as p62 or
sequestosome-1 [14]. Dusquetide modulates innate immune signaling
from a pro-inflammatory, pro-macrophage response to an anti-in-
flammatory and increased pro-macrophage response. This response
leads to decreased inflammation, increased bacterial clearance and in-
creased tissue healing [14–16]. Importantly, dusquetide is not an anti-
apoptotic or anti-necroptosis agent and cannot directly mitigate the
damage done by CRT to the tumor [1].
Although direct interference with tumor therapy is unlikely, and
indeed demonstrated not to occur preclinically [1], there are other
potential ancillary effects of p62 interactions on tumor biology [17].
Specifically, p62 is a ubiquitous protein that is present in most cells,
including aberrant tumor cells, and, through its role in autophagy, has
been shown to impact tumorigenesis [18]. Thus, p62 is believed to be
important in the tumorigenesis of MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line) where
autophagy is otherwise inhibited [19,20]. Again, a xenograft study with
MCF-7 cells not only demonstrated a lack of interference with CRT but
also demonstrated a lack of tumor enhancement with SGX942 treat-
ment. In fact, reduction in tumor volume was observed preclinically
with SGX942 treatment [1].
Innate immunity also plays a role in establishing the micro-
environment around a tumor. For example, p62 has been directly im-
plicated in facilitating the stromal cell microenvironment in multiple
myeloma via a mechanism involving increased IL-6 signaling [21,22].
To address the remote possibility that dusquetide may protect and/
or enhance tumor growth, tumor resolution was monitored in the
context of multiple myeloma cell growth in the presence of stromal cells
and throughout a recent Phase 2 HNC study, both immediately after
treatment and throughout a 12-month follow-up period. Similarly,
overall survival of these HNC patients was also monitored through this
same period.
2. Results and discussion
Dusquetide was not expected to negatively impact the stromal mi-
croenvironment of multiple myeloma cells, since this signaling has been
reported to rely on IL-6 signaling [21] and dusquetide has been shown
to significantly reduce IL-6 [15]. Nonetheless, a co-culture system with
human multiple myeloma cells was previously investigated and de-
monstrated that when dusquetide was pre-incubated with stromal cells,
those same stromal cells provided reduced support for multiple mye-
loma cell growth (Fig. 1).
As reported previously [1], dusquetide (SGX942) reduced the
median duration of SOM between initiation of CRT and the 1-month
follow-up visit in a 111-patient double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2
clinical trial of OM in HNC patients. In the patient population receiving
at least 55 Gy irradiation, this reduction was 50% (18 days vs. 9 days in
the placebo and SGX942 1.5 mg/kg treatment groups respectively,
p = 0.099). In higher risk subpopulations, this reduction improved to
67% (30 days vs. 10 days in the placebo and SGX942 1.5 mg/kg group
respectively [p = 0.040] in those patients receiving the highest doses of
cisplatin chemotherapy). Ancillary measures during this initial window
between initiation of CRT and the 1-month follow-up visit also de-
monstrated a decreased rate of non-fungal infection and an increased
rate of “complete response” in the tumor assessments at the 1-month
follow-up visit. The anti-infective and anti-inflammatory/tissue healing
aspects of dusquetide were expected on the basis of previous preclinical
work [15,1].
The one-year mortality rate in the placebo group was 81% (Fig. 2),
consistent with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results sta-
tistics of approximately 80% survival for patients with tumors of the
oral cavity, depending on tumor location [23]. In the dusquetide
treatment groups, mortality was significantly lower. Using the pre-de-
termined cutoff of p < 0.1 for statistical significance in this ex-
ploratory study yielded statistically significant improvement in survival
using Kaplan-Meier analysis (Fig. 2), compared to placebo. This de-
creased mortality was primarily observed in the follow-up period (after
the 1-month follow-up visit), suggesting it was not related to the de-
creased infection rate also observed in the dusquetide treated groups in
this study prior to the 1-month follow up visit. While the underlying
cause of the decreased mortality is unknown, these results certainly
support the contention that SGX942 was safe and well-tolerated,
without any identifiable negative side-effects in this patient population.
We previously reported a trend towards improved tumor resolution
at 1-month post CRT using the RECIST v 1.1 criteria [24]. While it was
not previously possible to ascertain if this improvement was transient or
enduring, monitoring throughout the 12-month follow-up window de-
monstrated that the effect was in fact enduring (Table 1). Moreover, the
Fig. 1. Dusquetide Pre-Incubated with Stromal Cells inhibits the Future Growth of Co-
cultured Multiple Myeloma Cells. Previously defined primary human bone marrow
stromal (mesenchymal (MSC)) cells (ReachBio lot# 2221207) were plated at a con-
centration of 104 per well on 12 well plates in a McCoy’s based medium (Hyclone, lot#
AVE72772) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, lot# ASF29773) and 2 mM L-
Glutamine (Hyclone, lot# AUJ25591). These cells had been characterized by flow cyto-
metry and the standard phenotype (CD45- CD34- CD73+ CD105+ CD90 + ) confirmed
previously. The cells were used at passage 2 in all experiments. MM1.S cells (lot #
9000068) were purchased from ATCC and were cultured as recommended by the supplier
in RPMI medium (Hyclone, lot# AVB62578), supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, lot#
ASF29773) and Glutamax (Gibco, lot# 889105) and allowed to expand. The marrow
stromal cells were allowed to grow for 3 days. After this time, dusquetide was added at
the indicated concentrations. Following 48 h incubation with dusquetide, the medium
(and compound) was removed and the wells washed with RPMI containing 10% FBS and
2 mM L-Glutamine. To each well, 3 × 104 MM1.S cells were added, and following an
additional 48 h, these cells were removed by pipetting vigorously up and down and
collecting the contents of each individual well into 5 mL tubes. Cell counts were per-
formed without dilution using a Neubauer chamber.

 patients in the placebo group continued to improve, eventually having a
response rate more similar to the 1.5 mg/kg dusquetide treated group
(Table 1). These results may indicate that dusquetide accelerated the
tumor resolution. Given the size of this initial Phase 2 trial, it is im-
possible to ascertain if this improvement was due to increased com-
pliance with CRT therapy or due to a direct effect of dusquetide on the
tumor and its microenvironment. Given the known biology of p62 and
the previously reported preclinical findings, it is possible that dusque-
tide had a direct anti-tumor effect in addition to reducing the duration
of SOM.
These results demonstrate that not only does dusquetide reduce the
duration of a debilitating and burdensome side effect of most cancer
treatment regimens, but that it could be associated with significant
ancillary benefits including decreased infection rates and accelerated
tumor resolution.
