Summary
Background Increasing evidence suggests photoprotection by oral supplementation
with b-carotene and lycopene.
Objectives To examine the capacity of lycopene-rich tomato nutrient complex
(TNC) and lutein, to protect against ultraviolet (UV)A/B and UVA1 radiation at
a molecular level.
Methods In a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized, crossover study two
active treatments containing either TNC or lutein were assessed for their capacity to
decrease the expression of UVA1 the radiation-inducible genes HO1, ICAM1 and
MMP1. Sixty-five healthy volunteers were allocated to four treatment groups and sub-
jected to a 2-week washout phase, followed by two 12-week treatment phases sepa-
rated by another 2 weeks of washout. Volunteers started either with active treatment
and were then switched to placebo, or vice versa. At the beginning and at the end of
each treatment phase skin was irradiated and 24 h later biopsies were taken from
untreated, UVA/B- and UVA1-irradiated skin for subsequent reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction analysis of gene expression. Moreover, blood samples
were taken after the washout and the treatment phases for assessment of carotenoids.
Results TNC completely inhibited UVA1- and UVA/B-induced upregulation of
heme-oxygenase 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and matrix metallopeptidase
1 mRNA, no matter the sequence (ANOVA, P < 0�05). In contrast, lutein provided
complete protection if it was taken in the first period but showed significantly
smaller effects in the second sequence compared with TNC.
Conclusions Assuming the role of these genes as indicators of oxidative stress, pho-
todermatoses and photoageing, these results might indicate that TNC and lutein
could protect against solar radiation-induced health damage.

Molecular markers for UVA1-inducible genes may be a suitable tool with which to
address photodamage in human skin in vivo.
What is the translational message?
•
Dietary strategies may help to protect human skin from UV radiation.
There is growing evidence that dietary intervention can pro-
tect human skin against the detrimental effects caused by solar
ultraviolet (UV) radiation.1 In this regard, carotenoids are of
particular interest.2 The vast majority of published studies have
focused on b-carotene. Accordingly, based on the outcome of
seven human intervention studies,3–9 we previously performed
a meta-analysis which showed that supplementation with b-
carotene is associated with protection against the development
of a sunburn reaction.10 However, it should be noted that
safety concerns were raised with regard to b-carotene supple-
ments when they are taken over longer periods of time (i.e.
years) at nonphysiological levels. Accordingly, in smokers and
asbestos workers, a higher cumulative index for lung cancer
has been observed.11
As a consequence, more recent studies on oral photoprotec-
tion have included other carotenoids, as well as b-carotene. It
was reported that a carotenoid mixture consisting of 8 mg
each of b-carotene, lycopene and lutein provided a level of
photoprotection similar to that achieved with 24 mg b-caro-
tene.5 Also, in an intervention study with lycopene-rich
tomato paste, which provided 16 mg lycopene daily, a signifi-
cant
reduction
of
solar
simulator-induced
erythema
was
observed in human volunteers after 10 weeks of supplementa-
tion.12 Of note, a combination of tomato phytonutrients from
a tomato-based supplement resulted in better protection from
UV-induced radiation than the effect of synthetic lycopene as
a
standalone
treatment.13
A
randomized
controlled
trial
showed that lycopene rich-tomato paste was able to prevent
UV-induced effects at the molecular level.14 The beneficial
effect of the colourless tomato carotenoids phytoene and phy-
tofluene in the protection of skin cells from UV damage was
further supported in vitro.15 All these in vivo studies used the
UV-induced erythema response, which was induced by a solar
simulator and consisted of a combination of UVB and UVA
radiation as the readout system for photoprotection efficacy.
This is somewhat surprising because (i) carotenoids are
thought to provide photoprotection by acting as antioxidants
(at least primarily); and because (ii) the solar simulator radia-
tion-induced erythema response, which results from the UVB
part of the emission spectrum, is mainly the consequence of
the UVB radiation-induced formation of DNA photoproducts
such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers,16 that is, a photobio-
logical event, which cannot be, or can only slightly be,
reduced by antioxidants. However, it should be stated that
shortwave UVB radiation and UVA radiation can cause oxida-
tive stress.17 Longwave UV radiation (UVA1)-induced gene
expression might be a choice for readout, to show beneficial
effects of antioxidants.
Whether nutritional supplementation with lycopene and/or
lutein
can
protect
against
UVA1
radiation-induced
gene
expression is not known. In the present placebo-controlled,
double-blinded, randomized, crossover study, we assessed the
capacity of two different nutritional supplements, that is, a
lycopene-rich tomato nutrient complex (TNC) and a lutein
containing one, to prevent not only UVB/A radiation (emitted
from a solar simulator), but also UVA1 radiation-induced gene
expression in human skin. Specifically, we analysed the mRNA
expression of genes known to be UVA1-inducible, as well as
UVB/A-inducible, and which are functionally involved in solar
radiation-induced skin damage. These genes included HO1 as
an indicator gene for oxidative stress (reviewed by Nisar
et al.),18 MMP1 (reviewed by Krutmann and Gilchrest),19 which
is critically involved in collagen breakdown and thus pho-
toageing of human skin, and ICAM1, which plays an important
role in skin inflammation and is expressed at increased levels
in lesional skin of patients with polymorphic light eruption
(PLE; reviewed in Vandergriff and Bergstresser).20
Materials and methods
Materials
TNC capsules and lutein-containing capsules, as well as pla-
cebo capsules, were provided by Lycored (Be’er Sheva,
Israel). Lycopene-rich TNC softgel capsules contained 5 mg
lycopene, as well as other tomato phytonutrients, such as
phytoene
and
phytofluene,
tocopherols
and
phytosterols.
Lutein softgel capsules contained 10 mg free lutein stabi-
lized by 10% carnosic acid, whereas placebo softgel capsules
contained soybean oil. The latter proved to be an acceptable
placebo in clinical trials addressing x3 fatty acid supple-
mentation.21 The UV blocking capacity of most natural oils
was shown to be insufficient to obtain significant protec-
tion.22 Specifically, while soybean oil is rich in x3 fatty
acids, for example a-linolenic acid, its conversion into pho-
toprotective long-chain x3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is
poor in mammals.23,24 Correspondingly, no significant effect
on UV responses could be detected for the biomarkers
assessed under placebo treatment (see Figs 3 and 4). There
was a slight colour difference between the placebo capsules
and the capsules containing lycopene (which looked dar-
ker), but this difference was only recognizable during direct

 comparison. Dosage for the two different treatment arms
was as follows: two capsules of TNC twice daily; one lutein
capsule twice daily. All supplements were supplied in iden-
tically packed, coded containers.
Volunteers
The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the
Heinrich-Heine University, D€
usseldorf, Germany (project no.
2869), and conducted at the IUF – Leibniz Research Institute
for Environmental Medicine, D€
usseldorf, Germany, according
to the ethical rules stated in the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki, and the International Council for Harmonisation
of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use
Good Clinical Practice guidelines were adhered to, as applica-
ble. Sixty-five healthy participants (52 men, 13 women) were
enrolled, based on a power calculation with the following
assumptions: based on a within-subject SD of the response
variable (biomarker) of 30%, the probability was 80% that
the study would detect a treatment difference at a two-sided
5% significance level, if the true difference between the treat-
ments was > 20%.
The study was conducted between November 2008 and
October 2009. The age of the volunteers ranged from 18 to
60 years; all individuals were nonsmokers, had normal eating
habits and no history of any skin disease or skin cancer. Fur-
ther exclusion criteria were: pregnant or lactating women,
intensely tanned skin and skin abnormalities in the test areas,
sunbed use or sunbathing, and unusual eating habits (e.g. veg-
etarian). Participants were urged to keep a balanced diet with-
out consuming tomatoes, tomato products and other dietary
supplements.
Study design
The overall study design was that of a placebo-controlled,
double-blinded, randomized crossover intervention study. For
each nutritional supplement, two consecutive periods consist-
ing of a washout phase of 2 weeks followed by a treatment
phase of 12 weeks were carried out (Fig. 1). The study con-
sisted of two arms, a lycopene-rich TNC arm, and a lutein
treatment arm. The participants enrolled at the IUF were dis-
tributed according to an online block randomization service
by the sponsor; block size was four with an allocation ratio of
1: 1 per study arm: lycopene active group (TGA); lycopene
placebo group (TGB); lutein active group (TGC); lutein pla-
cebo group (TGD). After the first treatment phase volunteers
within one treatment arm were crossed over and the second
washout phase and treatment phase were conducted. At the
beginning of the study and at the end of each treatment phase
participants were locally exposed to 1�5 minimal erythemal
dose (MED) of UVB/A using a solar simulator (Dr. K. H€
ohnle
GmbH, Germany) with a lamp filter combination according to
COLIPA standards, or UVA1 radiation (100 J cm�2) using a
Sellamed 2000 device (Dr Sellmeier, Gevelsberg, Germany)
with an emission spectrum of 340–400 nm as previously
described.25,26 The individual MED was determined 24 h after
irradiation of six skin areas on the upper buttock with increas-
ing amounts of UVB/A as the lowest dose causing visible ery-
thema. Blood samples drawn from the cubital vein were
collected four times: at the end of the first washout phase, at
the end of the first treatment phase, at the end of the second
washout phase and at the end of the second treatment phase.
Serum samples were prepared and stored at �80 °C until
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis for
lycopene and lutein contents. Three 6-mm punch biopsies
were obtained from buttock skin of each volunteer 24 h after
irradiation. Irradiations were given at the end of the first
washout phase, at the end of the first treatment phase and at
the end of the second treatment phase. At each time point,
one biopsy was taken from nonirradiated skin, one biopsy
from UVB/A-irradiated skin and one biopsy from UVA1-irra-
diated skin.
Assessment of blood samples
Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes and imme-
diately centrifuged. Plasma was stored at �80 °C until analy-
sis.
Carotenoids
(lutein,
zeaxanthin,
b-cryptoxanthin,
lycopene, a-and b-carotene) were analysed by HPLC with
UV/visible detection as previously described.27,28
Assessment of gene expression
Biopsies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
�80 °C until further analysis, which was done as previously
described.29,30 For reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) analysis of mRNA expression the following primer
pairs were used: heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1; forward 50-CT
GCGTTCCT-GCTCAACATC-30, reverse 50-GCAGAATCTTGCAC
TTTGTTGCT-30;31 matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP-1; forward
50-GGGAGATCATCGGGACAACTC-30, reverse 50-GGGCCTGGT
T-GAAAAGCAT-30;32 intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-
1; forward 50-CCTGGCACCCAGCACAAT-30, reverse 50-GCCGA
TCCACACGGAGTACT-30);33 and 18S rRNA as housekeeping
gene (forward 50-GCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCTTG-30, reverse
50-CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG-30).34
For comparison of relative gene expression in real-time PCR
the 2(�DDC(T)) method was used.35 Gene expression is indi-
cated as x-fold induction vs. an unirradiated control.
Statistical analysis
Normality of the data was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test.
For comparison of significant differences, a paired test, t-test or
ANOVA was used. In case of normality failure, the corresponding
rank test, for example Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann–Whit-
ney rank sum test or Kruskal–Wallis
ANOVA on ranks were
employed. As post hoc analysis, the Tukey test was used as
otherwise stated. A P-value < 0�05 was considered significant.
Data are presented as point or box plots with median and corre-
sponding percentiles as indicated in the figure legends.

 Results
For the lycopene-rich TNC arm of the study, 33 participants
were recruited. Of these 29 [four women (mean � SEM age
40�0 � 7�9 years),
25
men
(mean
�
SEM
age
43�0 � 2�3 years)] completed the study. For the lutein arm
of the study, 32 participants were recruited, of whom 30
completed the study [seven women (mean � SEM age
47�0 � 3�2 years),
23
men
(mean
�
SEM
age
37�0 � 2�3 years)]. Compliance was good (98–100 %) in
both treatment arms. This was also documented by the devel-
opment of lycopene and lutein blood levels, as shown in Fig-
ure 2. In both treatment arms the two treatment groups did
not significantly differ in regard to blood levels of lycopene
[TGADay15: 0�609 nmol
mL�1
and
TGBDay15: 0�554 nmol
mL�1 (median, Mann–Whitney rank sum test P = 0�844)]
and
lutein
[TGCDay15:
0�216 nmol
mL�1
and
TGDDay15:
0�221 nmol mL�1 (mean, t-test P = 0�852)] prior to the
intervention. Both carotenoids significantly increased upon
intake of the lycopene- or lutein-containing capsules, but
decreased
to

levels
or
did
not
increase,
respectively, when participants were treated with placebo.
Lutein levels in the TGC group did not completely decrease
to
baseline
after

washout
phase
(Fig. 2b).
Nutritional intervention was well tolerated in all partici-
pants. With regard to safety, only one adverse event was
reported by a volunteer from the lycopene arm of the study
who suffered from diarrhoea a few days after starting with
treatment. An external physician diagnosed the participant suf-
fering from a viral infection of the upper intestine. The volun-
teer continued the study after a few days.

or lutein. During enrolment, demographic data were obtained and volunteers were allocated to the four treatment groups: lycopene active group
(TGA), lycopene placebo group (TGB), lutein active group (TGC) or lutein placebo group (TGD). At the end of the first 2-week washout phase,
at day 14, individual minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of the volunteers were determined. A day later (day 15), blood samples were taken, and
ultraviolet (UV)A1 and UVA/B irradiations were performed. After 24 h, at day 16, three biopsies were taken. The first treatment phase began and
lasted 12 weeks. At the end of the first treatment phase (day 100), blood samples were taken and UVA1 and UVA/B irradiations were performed.
One day later (day 101), biopsies were taken and the second washout phase was started. At day 115, the second washout was finished, blood
samples were taken and the second treatment phase started. After another 12 weeks (day 199), blood samples were taken and UVA1 and UVA/B
irradiations were performed. One day later (day 200) biopsies were taken. Blood samples were used for determination of lycopene and lutein
content. Biopsies were used for analysis of molecular markers.

1234 Lycopene protects human skin from UVA/B and UVA1-induced gene expression, S. Grether-Beck et al.
 Assessment of gene expression revealed that UVB/A, as well
as UVA1, radiation significantly upregulated steady-state levels
of HO-1, ICAM-1 and MMP-1 mRNA in skin of volunteers
who were either untreated or had been treated with placebo.
In marked contrast, TNC (Fig. 3), as well as lutein (Fig. 4),
treatment significantly inhibited UVB/A and UVA1 radiation-
induced gene expression.
As the factors for UVA1 and UVB/A induction of gene
expression differed, we calculated, for further comparison, the
remaining gene expression under active treatment as percent-
age of gene induction under nonprotected conditions, which
had been set to 100%. The photoprotective effect of the active
treatment did not differ between UVB/A- and UVA1-irradiated
skin areas in both treatment arms (Table 1). In addition, we
observed that the photoprotective effect of the active treatment
did not differ in participants who were first treated with active
agent and then crossed over to placebo, or who were first
treated with placebo and then crossed over to active treatment
in the lycopene-rich TNC arm of the study (Table 2). In con-
trast, we observed differences for the lutein arm (Table 2).
When lutein was given in the second phase of the treatment
significantly
lower
photoprotection
against
UVA-induced
ICAM-1 expression was detected, while the change for UVA-
induced protection against HO-1 and MMP-1 was not signifi-
cant (Table 2). For protection from UVB/A-induced gene
expression, significantly lower protection was observed for all
three markers studied (Table 2).
Lycopene-rich TNC and lutein supplementation did not sig-
nificantly differ in their capacity to prevent UVB/A and UVA1
radiation-induced gene expression, when both active agents
had been given in the first treatment phase (Table 2). When
lutein was given in the second treatment phase (TGD group) a
decreased capacity to prevent UVA-induced upregulation of
ICAM-1 or HO-1, and all UVA/B-induced markers assessed
was determined (Table 3).
Discussion
In this placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized, cross-
over study we assessed the capacity of a lycopene-rich TNC
and a lutein-containing nutritional supplement to protect
human skin against UV radiation (UVR). To the best of our
knowledge we show here, for the first time, that (i) TNC and
lutein do not only protect healthy human skin against UVB/A,
but also against longwave UVA1 radiation; and (ii) that oral
photoprotection of healthy human skin can be demonstrated
at the level of HO1, ICAM1 and MMP1 gene expression.
This conclusion is based on the observation that intake of
lycopene-rich TNC and lutein-containing capsules, in contrast
to placebo capsules, was associated with a significant reduction
of UVR-induced mRNA expression of HO-1, MMP-1 and
ICAM-1 (Figs 3 and 4).
These results corroborate and extend results from a previous
study in which oral supplementation with a nutritional sup-
plement containing TNC, b-carotene and Lactobacillus johnsonii
was found to mitigate the development of skin lesions, as well
as the concomitant upregulation of ICAM-1 mRNA in UVA1-
irradiated lesional skin of patients with
PLE.29,30 Taken
together, these studies imply that oral photoprotection with
selected carotenoids not only provides protection against
shortwave UVB/A radiation, but also against longwave UVA1
radiation. The precise mechanism by which lycopene and
lutein inhibit UVA1 radiation-induced gene expression is cur-
rently not known but most likely involves antioxidative mech-
anisms.
A strength of the study is the double-blind, randomized,
controlled design. In addition, a sufficient number of volun-
teers was included based on a reasonable sample size. The
crossover design increased the power and decreased the con-
founding covariates as each volunteer was his/her own con-
trol.
Frequently, a weakness of crossover studies is inappropriate
washout phases. In the case of lycopene, a 2-week washout
period seemed to be reasonable, as previously shown for
serum levels.36 Similarly, washout phases ≥ 2 weeks were suf-
ficient to change serum lutein levels by supplementation from
egg yolk.37 A weakness of the crossover design was observed
in the lutein arm, where we determined lower protection level
if the lutein intake was preceded by 16 weeks of restricted

 diet due to washout and placebo treatment (Tables 2 and 3).
Obviously, the 12-week intake phase in the TGD group was
not sufficient to reach similar blood levels as the patients in
the TGC group (Fig. 2b), as the lutein was accumulated some-
where
else.38
Accordingly,
UVA1
radiation-induced
gene
expression was previously shown by us and others to involve,
critically, the generation of singlet oxygen as an initiating
event,39–41 which most likely can be targeted by the well-
known capacity of carotenoids and of lycopene, in particular,
to quench singlet oxygen.2
These findings are of obvious clinical relevance because
UVA1 radiation is well known to contribute to photoageing
and photocarcinogenesis in healthy human skin, and to be an
important trigger for the most frequent photodermatosis, that
is, PLE. In this regard it is of interest that the genes we found
to be reduced in their UVA1 inducibility are critically involved
in these pathological conditions. Therefore, we suggest that
oral supplementation with lycopene-rich TNC and lutein may
be efficient in inhibiting UVA1 radiation-induced oxidative
stress
responses
in
general,
and
gene
regulatory
events
involved in photoageing, photocarcinogenesis and photoder-
matoses specifically.
Notably, the TNC used in this study contained a combina-
tion of tomato phytonutrients. Previous studies suggest that
the combined effect of tomato phytonutrients in protection
from UV-induced erythema is stronger than the effect of lyco-
pene as a standalone treatment.13 Other tomato carotenoids,
namely phytoene and phytofluene, have been suggested to
have a protective effect of skin cells from UV damage.15 The
combination of lycopene with phytoene and phytofluene was

1238 Lycopene protects human skin from UVA/B and UVA1-induced gene expression, S. Grether-Beck et al.
 recently suggested to be synergistic in another cellular model
of prostate cells.42 We suggest that the protective effect of the
TNC in this study is the result of the combined effect of the
tomato phytonutrients. To ingest 20 mg lutein and 20 mg
lycopene, a cup of chopped kale (130 g) and a serving
(242 g) of tomato juice would be enough.43
Exposure to UVR is, to date, considered the primary pre-
ventable cause of skin ageing, a process that includes loss of
elasticity, and drying and wrinkling. The specific genes found
to be regulated in the current study might reflect on skin
appearance. Accordingly, a significant correlation was found
between forehead skin roughness and lycopene concentration
in the skin of 40–50-year-old men and women.44 Moreover,
an antioxidant supplement containing TNC in combination
with other phytonutrients was previously shown to support
parameters related to skin structure and appearance, such as
skin density, thickness, and roughness and scaling.45
It should also be noted that inhibition of UVA1- and also
of UVA/B-induced gene expression by lycopene-rich TNC and
lutein supplementation was shown in relatively small groups
of only 30 study participants. This observation emphasizes that
a combination of a crossover design together with the assess-
ment of gene expression as a highly sensitive biological end
point represents a study design well suited to examine the
efficacy of nutritional strategies for skin health, including pho-
toprotection.
Further clinical trials addressing in vivo effects, such as an
increase in the MED, are necessary to verify the impact of the
molecular findings on human skin.
