Key Points
• Autologous hematopoietic cell
transplantation is safe and
effective in patients with HIV-
related lymphoma who meet
standard transplant criteria.
• Patients with HIV-related
lymphomas should not be
precluded from participating
in AHCT clinical trials.
Autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (AHCT) for HIV-infected patients is largely
limited to centers with HIV-specific expertise. The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical
Trials Network 0803/AIDS Malignancy Consortium 071 trial is a multicenter phase 2
study of AHCT for patients with HIV-related lymphoma (HRL). Eligible patients had
chemotherapy-sensitive relapsed/persistent HRL, were >15 years of age, and had
treatable HIV infection. Patients were prepared using carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine,
and melphalan and received consistent management of peritransplant antiretroviral
treatment. The primary endpoint was 1-year overall survival. Forty-three patients were
enrolled; 40 underwent AHCT. Pretransplant HIV viral load was undetectable (<50 copies/
mL) in 32 patients (80%); the median CD4 count was 249/mL (range, 39-797). At a median
follow-up of 24.8 months, 1-year and 2-year overall survival probabilities were 87.3% (95%
confidenceinterval[CI], 72.1-94.5) and 82% (95% CI, 65.9-91), respectively. The probability
of 2-year progression-free survival was 79.8% (95% CI, 63.7-89.4). One-year transplant-
related mortality was 5.2%. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 11 days and 18 days, respectively. Nine patients
experienced a total of 13 unexpected grade 3-5 adverse events posttransplant (10 grade 3 and 3 grade 4 events). Twenty-two patients
had at least 1 infectious episode posttransplant. At 1 year post-AHCT, median CD41 T-cell count was 280.3 (range, 28.8-1148.0); 82.6%
had an undetectable HIV viral load. Trial patients were compared with 151 matched Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant
Research controls. Outcomes between HIV-infected patients and controls were not statistically significantly different. HRL patients
should be considered candidates for AHCT if they meet standard transplant criteria. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov
as #NCT01141712. (Blood. 2016;128(8):1050-1058)
Introduction
Infection with HIV is associated with a significantly increased risk
of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) even when patients are treated successfully with
modern antiretroviral therapy.1-4 Before the advent of effective anti-
HIV therapy, HIV-infected patients were not candidates for standard,
combination chemotherapeutic regimens because of the significant risk
of opportunistic infection and poor malignancy response rates.5 Since
1996, however, the availability of combination anti-retroviral therapy
(cART) has altered our previous understanding of how best to manage
patients with HIV-related malignancies.6,7 Treatment with cART
results in profound suppression of HIV viremia, marked numerical
recovery of CD41 T cells, and decreased risk of opportunistic
infections.8-13 Despite this dramatic immunological reconstitution,
patients in the post-cART era still have a 25-fold increased incidence
of NHL and their risk of HL has not decreased from that in pre-cART
era.2,14-16
Patients with HIV-related lymphomas (HRLs) currently receive
standard therapeutic regimens and achieve outcomes comparable to
those of non–HIV-infected individuals.7,14,17-24 The role of autologous
hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) in the care of patients

From 
 with HRL, however, remains unclear. AHCT is the standard of care
for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive relapsed and persistent
lymphoma.24,25 HIV infection, however, has long been considered an
a priori contraindication to transplantation. Commencing in the late
1990s, groups in both Europe and the United States piloted the use of
AHCT in the care of patients with high-risk, relapsed, and persistent
HRL.26,27 These initial experiences were encouraging and provoked
other investigators to study the use of AHCT for patients with relapsed
and persistent HRL.28-33 These data, however, are limited in that
many of these studies were retrospective in nature, AHCT was
largely limited to centers with significant HIV-related expertise, they
included a wide variety of transplant preparative regimens, and
management of cART in the peri-HCT period was variable. This has
prevented full acceptance of AHCT as the standard of care for
patients with relapsed and persistent HRL. AHCT for patients with
HRL remains largely limited to centers with significant HIV-specific
expertise, and HIV infection remains an exclusion criterion for most
transplant-related clinical trials.
Here we report the results of the Blood and Marrow Transplant
Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 0803/AIDS Malignancy Consor-
tium (AMC) 071 study. This was a phase 2 clinical trial designed to
prospectively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AHCT for patients
with HRL in a multicenter setting.
Patients and methods
Study design
Between April 2010 and March 2013, a prospective phase 2 multicenter trial was
conducted by the BMT CTN in collaboration with the AMC. Patients who met
trial eligibility criteria underwent AHCT following a preparative regimen that
consistedofmodifiedcarmustine,etoposide,cytarabine,andmelphalan(BEAM)
treatment: carmustine 300 mg/m2 (day – 6), etoposide 100 mg/m2 twice daily
(days 25 to 22), cytarabine 100 mg/m2 twice daily (days 25 to 22), and
melphalan 140 mg/m2 (day 21). Patients underwent AHCT on day 0 and
received supportive care per the respective institutional standard through the
period of post-AHCT recovery. The primary end point of the trial was overall
survival (OS) after AHCT for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive, aggressive
B-cell lymphomaorHLin HIV-infectedpatients.Secondary endpointsincluded
progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression, complete remission (CR),
and overall response (CR plus partial response [PR]) rates at day 1100,
lymphoma disease-free survival, time to hematopoietic recovery, hematological
function at day 1100, toxicities, incidence of infections, treatment-related
mortality, and immunological reconstitution.
Theprotocolwas approved bytheprotocolreviewcommittee ofthe National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and local institutional review boards. All
patients signed the approved informed consent in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Eligibility criteria.
Patients enrolled onto the trial had documented
evidence of HIV infection, were a minimum of 15 years of age with a Karnofsky
performance status .70%, and persistent or recurrent diffuse large B-cell,
immunoblastic, plasmablastic, Burkitt or Burkitt-like NHL or classical Hodgkin
lymphoma. Patients must have received no more than 3 prior treatment regimens
and 2 or fewer salvage regimens. Monoclonal antibody therapy and local
radiation were considered prior therapies. Patients had to have chemosensitive
disease as demonstrated by response to induction or salvage chemotherapy.
Adequate organ function for AHCT was required, as was ,10% marrow
involvement after patients’ most recent salvage therapy.
Patients could not have had prior AHCT or allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation. Patients had to initiate their conditioning regimen within
3 months of mobilization or bone marrow harvest. Hematopoietic progenitor cell
(HPC) mobilization was per institutional standards. Patients were required to
achieve adequate HPC mobilization (.1.5 3 106 CD341 cells/kg) to be eligible
for the protocol. Patients could not have HIV infection resistant to pharmaco-
logical therapy or opportunistic infection unresponsive to treatment.
Treatment.
Patients meeting study eligibility criteria were treated with
the BEAM transplant preparative regimen followed by AHCT. The day of
AHCT was designated day 0. cART was held from the time of initiation of the
BEAM regimen and resumed at least 7 days after completion of the
preparative regimen or following recovery from transplant-related gastroin-
testinal toxicities. Because of the long half-life of efavirenz and risk of
resistance during even single therapeutic interruptions, efavirenz was held at
least 2 weeks before initiation of the preparative regimen and an alternative
agent substituted during this period. Use of zidovudine was prohibited
following AHCT because of its myelosuppressive effects. Patients received
growth factor, transfusion, and antimicrobial supportive care as per the
respective institutional standards.
End points.
The primary end point for the trial was 1-year OS, including
death from any cause, with the time interval defined from day 0 AHCT to death.
Time to progression was defined as the interval from day 0 AHCT to the time
of relapse or progression, or to receipt of antilymphoma therapy other than
consolidative localized radiotherapy to sites of prior bulky disease. PFS was
definedastheintervalfromday0AHCTtodeath,diseaserelapse,orprogression.
Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was defined as death occurring in a patient
from causes other than relapse/progression. Patients underwent disease status
assessments before AHCT, at day 1100, and at 1 year post-AHCT. Lymphoma
responses were assessed using the Cheson criteria for determination of CR and
CR plus PR rates at day 1100.34
Patients underwent post-AHCT laboratory testing twice a week from
day0throughneutrophilrecovery andthenat 8weeks,day1100,16months,
and at 1 and 2 years. Time to hematopoietic recovery was defined as the first
of 2 consecutive days of .500 neutrophils/mL following nadir and time to
platelet count .20 000/mL for the first of 2 consecutive laboratory tests with
no platelet transfusions during the prior 7 days. Post-AHCT hematopoietic
recovery was defined as the patient achieving an absolute neutrophil count
.1500/mL, untransfused hemoglobin .10 g/dL, and untransfused platelets
.100 000/mL. Post-AHCT toxicities were graded using the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3. Grade 3 and higher
toxicities were collected. Microbiologically documented infections were
collected by site of disease, date of onset, severity, and resolution from
day 0 through 1 year post-AHCT. Recovery of immunoglobulin (Ig) levels
was assessed on peripheral blood by measuring quantitative immunoglobulin
levels (IgM, IgG, and IgA) on days 160, 1180, and 1365 post-AHCT.
Reconstitution of CD41 T cells was assessed on peripheral blood by flow
cytometry on days 160, 1180, and 1365 post-AHCT. The HIV viral load
was also assessed at each of these time points.
Statistical analysis
The date for cutoff for data analysis was October 26, 2015. End point analysis
was limited to the 40 patients undergoing AHCT. Patient, disease, and treatment
characteristics were summarized by median and range for continuous variables
and by frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Probabilities of OS
and PFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.35 Cumulative
incidences of relapse or progression, TRM, and neutrophil and platelet recovery
were calculated using the cumulative incidence function to accommodate
competingrisks.35ForTRM,relapseorprogressionwasthecompetingevent;for
relapse or progression, TRM was the competing event. For neutrophil and
platelet recovery, death without the event was considered the competing risk. In
all analyses, patients without an event were censored at last follow-up.
Outcomes of transplant recipients from this trial (cases) were compared with
outcomes of a cohort of non-HIV transplant recipients selected from the Center
for International Bone Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database
(controls). Up to 4 matched controls were selected for each case based on the
following criteria: age (within 10 years), Karnofsky performance score, disease,
and disease stage. The marginal Cox proportional hazards model of Lee, Wei,
and Amato was used to compare the risk of overall mortality, treatment failure,
relapse, or progression, TRM, and neutrophil and platelet recovery between the
cases and the controls.36 The marginal Cox model accounts for potential
correlation of outcomes between cases and matched controls.36

All analyses were done using SAS software (version 9.3, Cary, NC).
Results
Patients
Forty-three HIV-infected patients with relapsed/persistent NHL or
classical HL were enrolled onto the clinical trial. Median follow-up for
the study population was 24.8 months (range, 2.8 -27.7 months). Three
patients did not undergo transplantation because of disease progression
before conditioning; they are not included in the study analysis. There
were 6 protocol violations, including 1 patient who received a
cytarabine dose of 200 mg/m2 rather than 100 mg/m2, 1 who refused to
stop cART during the conditioning regimen, and 1 who received a
lower than calculated dose of etoposide.
Forty patients underwent AHCT at 16 different transplant centers.
Thirty-five patients were male. Median patient age was 46.9 years
(range, 22.5-62.2). All patients received ,3 prior treatment regimens.
Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1.
All patients received peripheral blood stem cell grafts. The median
transplantedHPCdosewas3.93106CD341cells/kg(range,1.6-11.0).
No patients failed to mobilize HPCs. The median number of apheresis
collections was 2 (range, 1-5).
The pretransplant HIV viral load was undetectable in 32 patients
(80%).Inpatientswithadetectableviralload,themedianviralloadwas
80 copies/mL (range, 50-17 455). The median pretransplant CD41
T-cell count was 249.0 CD41/mL (range, 39-797). Thirty-seven of
40 patients had planned interruptions in theircART during AHCT; data

of cART interruption was 15.5 days (range, 11-40 days).
OS, PFS, and post-AHCT disease response.
With a median
follow-upof24.8months(range,2.8-27.7 months),7patientsdied;5 of
whom died within 1 year of transplant. The 1-year OS probability was
87.3%(95%confidence interval[CI],72.1-94.5).TheOSprobability at
2 years was 82% (95% CI, 65.9-91) (Figure 1A).
At the time of transplant, 30 patients (75%) were in CR, 9 (22.5%)
werein PR,and 1patient withdisseminated HL(2.5%) hadprogression
at a single nodalsite immediately before transplantafter achieving a CR
to salvage therapy. At day 1100, 36 patients (92.3%) were in CR,
1 (2.6%) was in PR, 2 (5.1%) had relapsed/progressive disease, and
1 who died on day 164 was unevaluable. Six patients experienced
relapse/progression posttransplant; 4 of whom have died. The prob-
ability of 2-year PFS for the study group was 79.8% (95% CI,
63.7-89.4). The cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 2 years
was 12.5% (95% CI, 4.5-24.8) (Figure 1B).
The2-yearprobabilitiesfor OSand PFSfor the subgroupsofpatient
with either NHL or HL were comparable (Figure 1C-D).
Posttransplant mortality
Five patients experienced relapse/progression posttransplant within
1year;4ofthemdied(3ofthemwithinthefirstyear,1diedafter1year),
1 died of organ failure, and 1 from fungal infection. The estimated risk
of 1-year TRM was 5.2% (95% CI, 0.9-15.2).Two patients died after
1 year: 1 from recurrent/progressive disease and 1 from organ failure
(Table 2).
Time to hematopoietic recovery/hematologic function
post-AHCT
The median time to posttransplant neutrophil recovery was 11 days.
The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery by day 128 was
97.5% (95% CI, 77.7-99.7). The median time to platelet recovery was
18 days. Two patients’ platelet counts did not nadir below 20 000/mL.
One patient died before achieving platelet recovery. The cumulative
incidence of platelet recovery by day 1100 was 92.5% (95% CI,
75.9-97.8). Two patients achieved platelet recovery after day 1100.
At day 1100 posttransplant, 11 of 38 evaluable patients (28.9%)
achieved recovery of hematological function. At 1 year, 23 of
31 evaluable patients (74.2%) achieved recovery of hematological
function.

From 
 Sixteen patients required readmission following their initial trans-
plant admission. There were a total of 34 readmissions. The most
common causes for readmission were infection18 and fever.6 Two
patients were readmitted for management of relapsed/progressive
disease. Three patients required 4 or more readmissions. Twelve of the
readmissions occurred more than 1 year post transplant.
Immunological reconstitution post-AHCT
Immunological reconstitution studies were performed assessing both
recovery of immunoglobulin levels and CD41 T cells through 1-year
post-AHCT. By 1-year post-AHCT, median IgG, IgA, and IgM levels
had recovered to 1090 mg/dL (range, 270.0-2331.0), 123 mg/dL
(range, 6-534), and 48.5 mg/dL (range, 24-254), respectively.
Before AHCT, the median CD41 T-cell count was 249.0/mL
(range, 39-797). At the day 160, 1180, and 1365 analysis windows,
the median CD41 T-cell counts were 234.9 (range, 39.9-832.5), 200.6
(range, 72.6-897.7), and 280.3 (range, 28.8-1148.0), respectively

 HIV viral load assessments were performed before AHCT
and at 100, 180, 365 days, and 730 days posttransplant (Figure 3).
The results of these analyses are shown in Table 3 and Figure 3.
Although some patients had a transient rise in HIV viral load
post-AHCT, by day 365, 82.6% of the patients had an undetectable
viral load.
Comparison with CIBMTR comparison data set
OS and PFS for the study group was compared with a control group of
patients identified through the CIBMTR database. Controls were
matched for age, performance status, primary disease, and disease
status at AHCT. A total of 151 matched controls were identified for the
40 cases: 34 cases (85%) had 4 matched controls, 4 (10%) had 3

 matched controls, 1 (2.5%) had 2 matched controls, and 1 (2.5%) had 1
matched control. The age differences between a case and its matched
controls were small, with 127 (84%) of matched controls were within 1
year of the case age, 13 (9%) between 1 to 2 years, and the remaining
11 (7%) between 5 and 8 years of the case age. The probability of
1-year OS for the control group was 87.7% (95% CI, 80.9-92.2).
The probability of PFS for the control group was 69.5% (95% CI,
61.1-76.4).
Results of the comparison demonstrate that posttransplant
outcomes of HIV-infected study patients were not significantly dif-
ferent from outcomes of CIBMTR controls. The hazard ratio for
overall mortality in the HIV-infected patient group was 0.67 (95%
CI, 0.30-1.50; P 5 .33) (Figure 4A) compared with the controls. The
hazard ratio for treatment failure in the HIV-infected patient group
was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.2927-1.03; P 5 .06) (Figure 4B) compared with
the controls. Other comparisons include lymphoma progression
(HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.29-1.11; P 5 .0954), treatment-related
mortality (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.25-4.47; P 5 .9428), time to
neutrophil recovery (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74-1.19; P 5 .61), and
time to platelet recovery (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.60-1.28; P 5 .49).
Discussion
The availability of effective anti-HIV therapy has altered our previous
understanding of the best management for patients with HRL and has
allowed these patients to benefit from standard chemotherapeutic
regimens.7,14,17-23 Patients with HRL now have treatment outcomes
comparable to those of HIV uninfected patients. For NHL, regimens
such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxoru-
bicin,and rituximab and short-course etoposide,prednisone,vincristine,
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab, including a double
dosing of rituximab, produce remarkable PFS rates of 73% to 90% in
patients with HIV-related NHL.14,17-19,37 Similarly, for patients with
HL, use of regimens such as Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine,
and dacarbazine produces OS rates comparable with those of non–
HIV-infected individuals.20-23
The Parma group trial and subsequent clinical studies established
AHCTasthestandardofcareformanagingpatientswithchemotherapy-
sensitive, relapsed/persistent NHL and HL.24,25 HIV infection has
historically been viewed as a contraindication to AHCT. Before the
advent of cART, few studies seriously attempted to extend AHCT to
HIV-infected patients. Commencing in 2000, however, groups in
Europe and the United States began to investigate the role of AHCT
in the management of patients with HRL and treatment-responsive
HIV infection.26,29 These early efforts demonstrated the feasibility of
extending AHCT to patients with chemotherapy-sensitive, high-risk,
relapsed or persistent HRL.
Othergroupsexpandeduponthesuccessoftheseinitialtrials.33,38,39
In a multicenter prospective trial of 14 patients with high-risk or
relapsed HRL, at a median follow-up of 30 months, with a variety of
preparative regimens, Serrano and colleagues reported an estimated
event-free survival of 65%.33 In the first US cooperative group
trial, the AMC used a consistent preparative regimen (busulfan-
cyclophosphamide) regimen.38 Their results in 20 transplanted patients
demonstratedthatlymphomarelapseorprogressionwasthemaincause
of treatment failure and that HIV-associated opportunistic infections
did not contribute to mortality. In a European, prospective, intent-
to-treat trial of 50 patients with HRL, at a median follow-up of
44 months, the estimated OS and PSF were 74.6% and 75.9%,
respectively, for the subgroup of 27 patients who underwent AHCT.39
In the retrospective, European Group for Blood and Marrow Trans-
plantation study, 68 patients with HRL who had undergone AHCT
were retrospectively identified and reviewed. The group included 18
patients with HL. The patients were treated with either BEAM or
radiation-containing preparative regimens and treated at 20 different
centers.Theestimated3-yearOSandPFSforthegroupofpatientswere
61% and 56%, respectively, at a median follow-up of 32 months.40
In addition to demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of
AHCT in HIV-infected patients, this trial also demonstrates the prompt
reconstitution of immunoglobulin levels and CD41 T-cell counts post-
AHCT. The median CD41 T-cell counts returned to pretransplant
levels by the day 160 analysis window and were maintained through
day 1365. These data demonstrate that there does not appear to be any
long-term loss of CD41 T cells following AHCT and that significant,
long-term worsening of T-cell immunity is not a complication of
transplant.
The BMT CTN 0803/AMC 071 trial represents the largest
prospective study for the use of AHCT in patients with HRL. Unlike
many of the previously published studies, this trial used a consistent
preparative regimen and strategy for management of peritransplant
cART. An important finding of this trial is that the comparison of the
trial population with a matched population of control patients from the
CIBMTR data registry revealed that the outcomes for patients with
HRL did not differ statistically from that of non–HIV-infected patients.
This is consistent with the finding of prior case-control studies dem-
onstrating similar outcomes for AHCT in HIV-infected vs HIV-
uninfected patients.30,41 Together, these trials validate the concept that
controlled HIV infection should not preclude consideration of AHCT
for patients who otherwise meet standard transplant eligibility criteria.
The non–HIV-related inclusion and exclusion criteria for this trial were
adapted from those used in the previous BMT CTN 0401 trial, a study
that was designed for a non–HIV-infected population.
Some important HIV-related clinical issues are germane to the care
of patients with HRL that merit consideration before AHCT. Given the
pharmacology of anti-HIV drugs, it is important to review the cART
regimen before transplantation for possible drug–drug interactions with
eitherthepreparativeregimenorpost-AHCTsupportivecare.23Several
anti-HIV medications may have significant impact upon drug metab-
olism. Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors may be particularly prob-
lematic because of strong CYP3A4 inducers and should be
discontinued before initiating the preparative regimen.23 In addition,
given the significant myelosuppressive effects of zidovudine, this agent
should not be used in the peri-AHCT period. Also, as noted in this trial,
efavirenz has a long half-life and discontinuation of efavirenz-based
regimens before AHCT reduces the risk of patients developing
antiretroviralresistance;hence,asubstitutionwasmade atleast2weeks
before AHCT. Finally, decisions related to continuation or non-
continuation of cART therapy throughout the peritransplant period
should be made carefully to avoid repetitive starts and stops of the

 cART regimen that might increase the risk of HIV resistance. Although
there is no optimal cART regimen for use during treatment of HRL,
integrase inhibitors appear to be important agents to consider in this
context.Inareviewof158HIV-infectedpatientswithcancer,including
58% with hematological malignancies who were treated at MD
Anderson Cancer Center between 2001 and 2012, the authors of the
study found that protease inhibitors (PI) pose a challenge in the setting
of treating HIV-related malignancies because of significant drug–drug
interactions. They also found that integrase inhibitors had effectiveness
comparable to that of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
while appearing to be better tolerated than either PIs or non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors.42 Thus integrase inhibitor-containing
cART regimens should be considered in the context of AHCT for
patients with HRL, whereas PI, efavirenz, and AZT-containing reg-
imens may require modification before high-dose chemotherapy.
This trial builds on a body of previously published data to dem-
onstrate clearly that HIV infection alone should not be considered a
contraindication to AHCT in patients who otherwise meet transplant
inclusion criteria. AHCT should be considered the standard of care for
patients with HRL, provided that the HIV infection is treatment-
responsive. Patients with HRL should also be considered appropriate
potential participants for future AHCT clinic trials.
