Introduction: Therapy of malignant pleural mesothelioma and especially the adequate role of 
surgery in this context remain the subject of controversial discussions. Radical surgery in par-
ticular, which is associated with substantial morbidity, failed to translate into a definite survival 
advantage. We report on interim results of an ongoing Phase II study of regional chemotherapy 
in terms of isolated thoracic perfusion with chemofiltration (ITP-F).
Patients and methods: Twenty-eight patients (25 male, 3 female, mean age 63.4 years) with 
advanced pleural mesothelioma were included in this study. Isolation of the chest was achieved 
by insertion of a venous and arterial stop-flow balloon catheter via a femoral access. The aorta 
and inferior vena cava were blocked at the level of the diaphragm and the upper arms were 
blocked by pneumatic cuffs. Chemotherapy, consisting of 60 mg/m² cisplatin and 15 mg/m² 
mitoxantrone, was administered directly into the aorta. The isolated circuit was maintained for 
15 minutes followed by ~45 minutes of chemofiltration with a hemoprocessor until 5 L of filtrate 
were reached. The endpoints of the study were overall survival and quality of life (QoL).
Results: Out of 28 patients enrolled in the study, 5 had prior surgeries, 10 patients had sys-
temic chemotherapy, and 5 patients additional irradiation. In all patients in restaging, clinical 
progress was noted. In all, 162 cycles were administered. Due to chemofiltration, toxicity was 
within tolerable limits, revealing World Health Organization grade I leucopenia and thrombo-
cytopenia in 9 patients and mucositis grade I in 6 patients. The major surgical complication 
was inguinal lymphatic fistula in 40% of the cases. Gastrointestinal toxicity and/or neurotox-
icity were never observed. One-year survival was 49%, 2-year and 3-year survival was 31%, 
and 5-year survival was 18%. Median overall survival was 12 months and progression-free 
survival 9 months.
Conclusion: ITP-F for patients with advanced pleural mesothelioma, progressive after stan-
dard therapies, is an effective and well-tolerated treatment modality, offering comparably long 
survival data at a good QoL.

Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is commonly considered a tumor with a 
dismal prognosis, nonresponsive to any kind of chemotherapy. Surgical approaches 
such as pleurectomy and decortication or extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) are 
rarely curative and entail recurrences. It remains questionable whether or not patients 
benefit from extensive surgical interventions in terms of survival and quality of life 
(QoL).1 Combination therapies consisting of surgery, chemotherapy, and irradiation 
also had no substantial effect on the outcome in terms of improvement of symptoms 
and survival.2 Early stage I cases only seem to benefit from radical surgery.3

The reason for the poor therapeutic outcome so far is 
considered to be chemoresistance of the tumor itself and its 
biologic behavior, revealing a typical growth pattern with 
extended invasion of parietal and visceral pleura throughout 
the pleural cavity and finally invasion of the thoracic wall, 
mediastinum, and lungs.4 The vast majority of patients suffer-
ing from mesothelioma have a history of asbestos exposure 
some 3–4 decades prior to the onset and diagnosis of the 
disease.5 This explains why men are affected by far more 
than women and the median age is ~65 years.6
The lack of effective life-prolonging therapies in this 
mostly advanced disease justifies palliative measures just 
to alleviate discomfort and pain.7 In this context, there was 
a need for a less straining but effective and life-prolonging 
treatment modality.
High exposure intra-arterial chemotherapy is capable of 
overcoming chemoresistance of tumor cells and may induce 
substantial tumor response even if conventional systemic 
chemotherapy fails.8,9 Furthermore, chemotherapy-related 
toxicities can be diminished by means of chemofiltration 
after exposure to the cytotoxic agents.10–12
In this respect, we investigated isolated intra-arterial 
chemotherapy of the chest followed by chemofiltration in 
pretreated patients following multimodal therapy.
Patients and methods
Patients with histologically confirmed epithelioid MPM, 
clinical stage III and IV disease, and prior therapy were eli-
gible after informed consent for this Phase II study. Patients 
were required to be .18 years of age and have a Karnofsky 
performance status $60. Patients were also required to 
have adequate renal and cardiac function. This study was 
performed in compliance with the principles of good clinical 
practice, the Helsinki Declaration, and federal guidelines and 
had approval by the Medias Institutional Review Committee. 
Patients with advanced pleural mesothelioma, lacking further 
treatment options, signed informed consent for isolated tho-
racic perfusion (ITP) because the alternative option would 
have been best supportive care.
Twenty-eight patients with histologically proven epithe-
lioid MPM were included in this study. There were 25 male 
and 3 female patients; mean age was 63.4 years (range 
43–86 years). Twenty patients were characterized as stage IV 
and 8 patients as stage III MPM according to the Union for 
International Cancer Control staging system. Fifteen out 
of 28 patients (54%) had prior therapy in terms of surgery, 
chemotherapy, or radiochemotherapy; a minority underwent 
EPP and decortication (5/28; 18%). Six had video assisted 
thoracoscopic surgery with pleurodesis. Chemotherapies 
in 10 patients involved cisplatin and pemetrexed, were in 
progression, and refused further chemotherapy because of 
reduced performance. Four patients had received second-
line and 2 patients third-line systemic chemotherapy. Five 
patients (14%) had received additional conventional radio-
therapy between 50 and 56 Gy. All patients demonstrated 
progress in computed tomography (CT) scan before the 
study. In 20/28 patients (71%), the recommendation of 
an interdisciplinary conference (tumor board) was best 
supportive care due to lack of other therapeutic options. 
No patient had abdominal, cerebral, or bone metastases. 
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
ITP and chemofiltration (ITP-F)
Regional intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed under 
general anesthesia and systemic anticoagulation with heparin 
(Ratiopharm GmbH, Ulm, Germany) at a dose of 150 units/
kg bodyweight. Following insertion of a venous and arte-
rial 21 ch. three-channel stop-flow balloon catheter (PfM, 
Cologne, Germany) via an inguinal access, the inferior vena 
cava was blocked beneath the right atrium, and the aorta 
was blocked at the level of the diaphragm, both under X-ray 
control. Correct placement of the catheters was documented 
by cavography and aortography, respectively (Figure 1A 
and B). The upper arms were blocked by pneumatic cuffs, 
following which the isolation of the chest, head, and neck 
area was completed. After hyperoxygenation with a p02 of 
100% by mechanical ventilation, chemotherapy was carried 
out either manually with high pulsatile pressure against the 
aortic blood stream through the coaxial channel of the arte-
rial catheter which exits at its tip, or through an additional 
straight flush aortic catheter. A schematic model of the 
method is displayed in Figure 2.

isolated thoracic perfusion for progressive malignant pleural mesothelioma
After administration of chemotherapy, autochthonous 
perfusion with the heart as internal pump with blocked stop-
flow catheters was maintained for 15 minutes. Following 
de-blocking of both catheters, chemofiltration continued 
for ~45 minutes with 5 L of hemofiltration solution (Duosol 
containing 4 mmol/L potassium; B. Braun, Melsungen, 
Germany) using a Diapact CRRT hemoprocessor (B. Braun) 
at a maximum flow rate of 500 mL/min.
After filtration, the catheters were removed and the vas-
cular accesses repaired with 5/0 prolene running sutures. 
Thereafter, the small incision in the groin was surgically 
closed over a drain. Skin sutures were removed after the 
tenth postoperative day.
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
There are two aspects of how to create higher drug exposure 
as compared with systemic chemotherapy. First, by reducing 
the circulating blood volume in an isolated circuit, the drug 
concentration is increased. A volume reduction to one third 
or one fourth of the systemic circulation entails an increased 
drug concentration by a factor of 3–4.8 Figure 3A demon-
strates an example of a systemic bolus of 20 mg mitomycin 
(Medac GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) versus an intra-arterial 
injection of the same dose during ITP. The drug levels in the 
isolated circuit are 3–4 times higher than in the venous system, 
because of the reduced blood volume. It is worth noting that 
already after 10 minutes p.i. the intravascular chemotherapy 
concentrations are nearly at an equal level.
Second, a manual pulsatile injection through the arte-
rial stop-flow catheter generates first-pass concentrations 
of cisplatin (Medac GmbH) of ~70,000–80,000 ng/mL in 
the aorta while drug concentrations in the venous system 
(samples taken at the same time in the vena cava) stay low 
between 1,000 and 3,000 ng/mL (Figure 3B). The rapid 
elimination of the drug is due to dilution in the systemic 
blood volume and the so-called first-pass effect in the 
reduced circuit. After arterial administration of the drug, 
depending on the arterial blood flow and the total blood 
volume, 20- to 80-fold increased drug concentrations with 
correspondingly increased “first-pass uptake” are generated. 
Using systemic chemofiltration after 15 minutes of stop-
flow conditions, the injected drugs are reduced by 60% in 
the systemic circuit, thus resulting in marked reduction of 
toxicity directly after therapy as well as a reduction of late 
cumulative toxicity.10–12
chemotherapy and follow-up
Administered chemotherapy consisted of 60 mg/m2 cisplatin 
and 15 mg/m2 mitoxantrone. All 10 patients had previously 
received platinum systemically. In the isolation perfusion

setting, it is administered in high concentrations because of 
the arterial access. The concentration-dependent effect of 
mitoxantrone is comparable. The treatment was repeated at 
3-week intervals. Restaging was scheduled after each second 
course of ITP. In case of progressive disease (PD), the therapy 
was discontinued. In case of response or stable disease in chest 
CT scan, the treatment was continued until progress of the 
disease or deterioration of the patient’s performance status.
statistical analysis
The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The 
secondary endpoint included QoL and progression-free sur-
vival (PFS). This was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier methods 
and was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for 
patients who were still alive. Chemotherapy toxicity was 
evaluated using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity 
Criteria version 2.0.
Results
In all, 162 cycles were administered to 28 patients. There was 
no delay of therapy due to toxicity. In 6/28 patients (21%), 
chemotherapy was stopped after 2 cycles because the patients 
demonstrated PD in CT scan (4 patients) or deterioration of 
their performance status (2 patients). In most patients, therapy 
was stopped after the sixth cycle; however, 2 patients received 
15 cycles until PD was noted and therapy was discontinued. 
Despite multiple repeated therapies, notable or dose-limiting 
toxicity never occurred in these patients. About 32% of the 
patients (9/28) showed stable disease, while the remaining 
13 patients (46%) responded to therapy. Figure 4A and B

Median survival was 12 months. One-year survival was 49%, 
2-year and 3-year survival was 31%, and 5-year survival was 
18% (Figure 5). Median PFS was 9 months, 1 year PFS was 
37.5% (Figure 6).
Toxicity
Hematological toxicity was low with leucopenia and 
thrombocytopenia common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade I 
in 9 patients and mucositis grade I in 6 patients. Nausea 
and vomiting did not exceed CTC grade I in 12 patients. 
More than 95% of the patients suffered hair loss despite 
the application of a cool cap on the head during therapy. 
A transient phenomenon was facial edema, which occurred 
due to the high drug concentration during the stop-flow phase 
of the therapy. It persisted for 2–3 days but had no influence 
on the patient’s QoL. Patients with borderline respiratory 
functions prior to therapy may need substitution of oxygen 
because of a slight interstitial edema during 2–3 days after 
therapy. In all cases, respiratory parameters improved after 
the second postoperative day. Surgical complications, CTC

grade I (lymphatic fistulas), occurred in 40% of the patients. 
This was the major therapy-related complication. It was 
treated by vacuum lymphatic drainage. No patient had to 
be reoperated due to lymphatic fistula. After 14 days at the 
most, the drainage could be removed.
Major toxicity . CTC grade III or permanent liver or 
kidney damage never occurred. Toxicity from 15 minutes 
of hypoxia during treatment was noted in a slight elevation 
of the liver enzymes (maximum increase of 1.2-fold) and a 
slight elevation of serum creatinine. This was resolved at 
day 4–7 after therapy. All patients were discharged at least 
at day 5 after therapy. There was no gastrointestinal toxicity 
or neurotoxicity and no treatment-related death.
All patients who had prior systemic chemotherapy filled 
out a questionnaire comparing the 8 most common adverse 
events after systemic versus regional chemotherapy (RCT). 
It revealed an impressive advantage in favor of RCT as com-
pared with conventional systemic administration.7
Discussion
MPM is a therapy-resistant disease for which there is no cure. 
Even in stage I and II, surgical intervention is merely a pallia-
tive procedure – even if major operations are performed – in 
a multimodal setting to minimize tumor burden.13 This is 
achieved with substantial morbidity and mortality from the 
extensive operations.14
Following that, multimodal approaches (bi- and trimodality) 
are currently being investigated in this group of patients.15 Up 
to now, no substantial survival benefit could be achieved with 
these debilitating treatments. In the MARS trial, comparing EPP 
with no-EPP within a trimodal therapy, EPP did not add any 
benefit but rather caused side effects. With regard to the high 
morbidity and substantial mortality rate of a disease with short 
life expectancy the role of surgery remains questionable.6,16
Although there are no randomized trials comparing EPP 
with pleurectomy and decortication, historical controls on 
3,101 patients revealed a survival advantage for EPP in 
stages I and II.17 Due to the malignant characteristics of 
mesothelioma, a near curative R0 resection is not considered 
sufficient to prevent relapse, but a resection of all surrounding 
tissues with potential microscopic lesions as an adjunct to 
adjuvant treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and/or 
radiotherapy is aimed at.5
However, the majority of patients with MPM are not can-
didates for curative surgery because of their low performance 
status, comorbidities, age, and the extent of the disease. 
Platinum-containing compounds revealed better efficacy than 
non-platinum-containing compounds. The administration of 
3-drug compounds, however, did not show any advantage as 
compared to a 2-drug regimen.18 Interestingly, in first-line 
chemotherapy for unresectable disease, the combination 
of platinum–antifolate was superior to therapy with cis-
platin alone, increasing overall survival by 3 months. The 
combination therapy increased overall survival to 12.1 and 
11.4 months versus 9.3 and 8.8 months in the cisplatin-alone 
group, respectively.19,20 This short-term survival advantage,

isolated thoracic perfusion for progressive malignant pleural mesothelioma
although statistically significant (P-value =0.02 and 0.048, 
respectively), was accompanied by high-grade hematological 
and gastrointestinal toxicities.
The most recent randomized Phase III MAPS trial, how-
ever, comparing pemetrexed/cisplatin with (PCB) or without 
(PC) bevacizumab showed a significantly increased overall 
survival from 16.1 months in the PC arm to 18.8 months in 
the PCB arm. Grade III–IV adverse events, however, were 
significantly increased but manageable.21 Furthermore, 
toxicities are increased in elderly patients. The median age 
of patients with MPM ranges from 62 years in clinical trials 
to 74 years in routine clinical practice.22 Elderly patients are 
often not included and underrepresented in clinical trials. 
It has been described in a population-based epidemiological 
study that out of 37% (54/146) of patients with MPM declared 
suitable for chemotherapy, 52% declined this option and only 
18% of the patients were randomized into chemotherapy 
trials, from our point of view the most fit for therapy patients, 
thus not representing the typical clinical problem.23 Elderly 
patients often cannot receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
due to reduced performance. The substitution of cisplatin 
by carboplatin is in widespread use. However, this is not 
supported by any randomized clinical trial. In a retrospec-
tive study of 210 patients .70 years of age, only 73% 
mainly received single drug chemotherapy with pemetrexed. 
The median overall survival was 11.3 months.24 Although 
pemetrexed–platinum is considered the standard first-line 
chemotherapy for pleural mesothelioma, only ~50% of the 
patients respond to this therapy. Therefore, it is considered to 
provide no benefit in elderly patients with poor performance, 
especially, since no randomized trial has so far revealed any 
survival benefit from a second-line regimen.25
Several drugs and targeted therapies were investigated.26–28 
Despite the fact that angiogenesis is an important factor in 
progressive mesothelioma, none of the antiangiogenic drugs 
tested so far could meet the requirements for being incorpo-
rated into standard clinical care.29,30
No second-line therapies met the expectations of the 
investigators, and it is still an unmet need in this patient 
population. Locoregional therapy could therefore be an 
additional option in this group of patients.
Locoregional chemotherapy is investigated in terms 
of hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HIOC) by 
several investigators.31–33 Despite the heterogeneity of the 
included patients and tumors, the authors reported that the 
demanding procedure including maximum surgical cytore-
duction can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mor-
tality. Sugarbaker et al report a longer interval to recurrence 
(27.1 vs 12.8 months) and significantly prolonged overall 
survival (35.3 vs 22.8 months).31 However, that was a non-
randomized Phase II study, and the patient groups were well 
balanced for prognostic factors. There is a strong imbalance 
in the number of patients treated with HIOC versus non-
treated patients (n=72 vs 31 patients).
Looking at the existing data on various multimodal 
therapies, there is still a lack of therapies when conventional 
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy fail and result in 
PD. This gap, following this Phase II study, could be filled 
by the method of intra-arterial isolated perfusion with con-
comitant chemofiltration.
Although the patient population is heterogeneous in terms 
of pretreatment modalities, as is normal for such a study, 
the common basis of all investigated patients was treatment 
failure. For more or less all patients, the recommendation was 
best supportive care, resulting in a survival of 3–4 months.
An alternative method to isolation perfusion focuses 
on the high first-pass effect achieved with intra-arterial 
infusion.34 In this study, including 39 patients with non-
operable tumors, nonresponsive to systemic chemotherapy, 
infusion of the internal mammary or intercostal arteries via 
angiographically placed pigtail catheters generated local drug 
exposures, high enough to break through drug resistance of 
formally nonresponsive mesotheliomas. This study concen-
trates more on the feasibility of the method and determination 
of response. Side effects were low, although the reported 
“mean survival” rate of 15 months is not comparable with 
the generally used parameter “median survival”, which was 
not reported in this study.
In this respect, the term “median survival” of 12 months, 
expressing the 50% survival rate, is a more meaningful 
parameter. Although the therapy did not – as all other 
treatments – result in a cure for the patients, it offers a good 
palliative option with low treatment-related toxicity and 
good QoL. Despite the high local drug exposure, RCT is 
better tolerated than systemic chemotherapy, first, because 
not the entire organism is exposed to chemotherapy and 
second because of the subsequent lowering of systemic 
drug exposure due to chemofiltration. A comparative study 
on QoL in patients who received RCTs after prior systemic 
chemotherapy revealed an impressive advantage in terms 
of QoL during RCT as compared to conventional systemic 
administration.7 Hospitalization of the patients was short. 
As far as treatment modality is concerned, segmental isola-
tion of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm in ITP allows 
a more homogeneous and equal drug distribution with high 
local concentration via all intercostal arteries. It has been 
shown in our study that an increase in local drug exposure 
translates into reasonable response rates in advanced and also

heavily pretreated patients, ameliorating overall survival. 
It is of note that there can be a plateau phase in overall 
survival as the survival at 2 and 3 years is 37.5%. This is an 
indication that there may be a subgroup of patients, which 
has a long-lasting benefit from the therapy. Interestingly, 
the 2- and 3-year survivor group included pretreated and 
non-pretreated patients.
Data relating to which group of patients really benefits 
can only be obtained in a larger study. Randomization of the 
patients after failure of all other strategies is rather unethical 
and not practical. If these data can be confirmed by a larger 
study, we might have a new armamentarium for the fight 
against this still threatening disease.
Conclusion
RCT in terms of ITP-F provides an additional modality to be 
used in the treatment of MPM. High drug concentrations are 
translated into reasonable response rates after repeated treat-
ments. In this Phase II trial, locoregional chemotherapy was 
feasible and well tolerated. The toxicity profile was low, and the 
patients had a nearly normal QoL. Response rates and survival 
were encouraging with PFS of 9 months and median survival 
of 12 months in these heavily pretreated patients. Interestingly, 
2-year and 3-year survival rates were 31.2% and 23.4% at 
4 years. The data obtained are encouraging – though far from 
being satisfactory – and call for a potential improvement of 
application techniques, improvement of drug exposure, and an 
investigation of this method in a larger cohort of patients.
