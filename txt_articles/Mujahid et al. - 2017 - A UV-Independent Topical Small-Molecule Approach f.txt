SUMMARY
The presence of dark melanin (eumelanin) within
human epidermis represents one of the strongest
predictors of low skin cancer risk. Topical rescue
of eumelanin
synthesis,
previously
achieved
in
‘‘redhaired’’ Mc1r-deficient mice, demonstrated sig-
nificant protection against UV damage. However,
application of a topical strategy for human skin
pigmentation has not been achieved, largely due to
the greater barrier function of human epidermis.
Salt-inducible kinase (SIK) has been demonstrated
to regulate MITF, the master regulator of pigment
gene expression, through its effects on CRTC and
CREB activity. Here, we describe the development
of small-molecule SIK inhibitors that were optimized
for human skin penetration, resulting in MITF upre-
gulation and induction of melanogenesis. When
topically applied, pigment production was induced
in Mc1r-deficient mice and normal human skin. These
findings demonstrate a realistic pathway toward
UV-independent topical modulation of human skin
pigmentation, potentially impacting UV protection
and skin cancer risk.
INTRODUCTION
The incidence of nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers
has been increasing in the United States over recent decades
(Rogers et al., 2015; Ryerson et al., 2016; Watson et al., 2016).
Epidemiological evidence suggests that there is a causal rela-
tionship between sun/UV exposure and the three major histolog-
ic forms of skin cancer: squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell
carcinoma, and cutaneous melanoma (Gandini et al., 2005; Ken-
nedy et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2014). Individuals with fair skin and/or
poor tanning ability are at higher risk for developing these malig-
nancies (Armstrong and Kricker, 2001), which are uncommon
in darkly pigmented individuals (Pennello et al., 2000). During
UV-induced tanning, DNA damage in keratinocytes triggers
p53-mediated
transcription
of
the
pro-opiomelanocortin
(POMC) gene (Cui et al., 2007). Proteolytic cleavage of POMC
produces alpha-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone), which
binds to the melanocortin-receptor-1 (MC1R) on melanocytes,
activating adenylate cyclase. Elevated cyclic AMP (cAMP)
activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates the
cAMP-responsive-element-binding
protein
(CREB)
(Newton
et al., 2005; Tsatmalia et al., 1999), which, in turn, stimulates
the transcription of the microphthalmia-associated transcription
factor (MITF) gene (Bertolotto et al., 1998; Price et al., 1998).
MC1R non-signaling variants are associated with lighter skin
tones and red hair and are linked to poor tanning responses
(Valverde et al., 1995). Previously, topical application of the
cAMP agonist forskolin was shown to rescue the cAMP-MITF-
eumelanin pathway in Mc1r-deficient mice (D’Orazio et al.,
2006). Subsequent studies identified the phosphodiesterase
PDE4D3 as a key regulator of melanocytic cAMP homeostasis,
and its suppression produced hyperpigmentation similar to
forskolin treatment in red-haired mice (Khaled et al., 2010).
However, attempts to apply both of these small-molecule ap-
proaches to human skin have been unsuccessful, likely related
to poor skin penetration of the active species.
Genetic data in mice have suggested the presence of a
pathway in which CREB-regulated transcription co-activator
(CRTC) positively regulates and salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2)
negatively regulates MITF and pigment synthesis independently
of CREB phosphorylation by PKA (Horike et al., 2010). In macro-
phages, the small-molecule SIK inhibitor HG 9-91-01 has been
shown to regulate CREB-dependent gene transcription by sup-
pressing phosphorylation of CRTC (Clark et al., 2012), thereby
inhibiting cytoplasmic sequestration and permitting its nuclear
translocation. We hypothesized that small-molecule SIK inhibi-
tors could be generated and optimized as topical agents capable
of inducing cutaneous pigmentation independently of UV irradi-
ation in human skin.

 RESULTS
Small-Molecule Inhibition of SIK Induces MITF
Expression In Vitro
To test regulation of the pigmentation pathway by the previously
published SIK inhibitor HG 9-91-01 (HG) (Clark et al., 2012)
in vitro, we treated normal human melanocytes, UACC62
human melanoma cells, and UACC257 human melanoma
cells. Dose-dependent increases in expression of MITF were
observed in these cells in response to SIK inhibitor application
(Figures 1A, S1A, and S1D). RNA levels of the MITF target
gene TRPM1 (Miller et al., 2004) also increased and followed
the anticipated delayed kinetics relative to MITF induction
in normal human melanocytes (Figures 1B and 1C) and
UACC257 human melanoma cells (Figures S1G and S1H).
Gross pigmentation was observed in cell pellets of UACC257
human melanoma cells after 3 days of HG 9-91-01 treatment
(Figure 1D). Since SIK kinase activity is known to be dependent
on LKB1 (Katoh et al., 2006) we next evaluated whether SIK-
inhibitor treatment of LKB1-null G361 melanoma cells would
induce MITF. In LKB1-null G361 melanoma cells, there is no
MITF induction with SIK-inhibitor treatment (Figure S1J). In
contrast, when LKB1 is introduced in G361 melanoma cells
(Figure S1I), we observed a 6-fold induction of MITF expres-
sion with SIK-inhibitor treatment (Figure S1K), demonstrating
the dependence of SIK-inhibitor effect on active SIK. These
data suggest that small-molecule SIK inhibition can stimulate
the pigmentation pathway in vitro.
HG 9-91-01 Rescues Melanogenesis in Mice with
Inactive Melanocortin 1 Receptor
Since our in vitro results demonstrated that inhibition of SIK
by HG 9-91-01 positively regulated MITF transcription, we next
evaluated whether topical application of this compound could
induce pigmentation independent of MC1R in vivo. To test this,
we utilized a previously described mouse ‘‘red hair’’ model that
carries the inactivating Mc1re/e mutant allele and a transgene,
K14-SCF, in which stem cell factor expression is driven by the
keratin-14 promoter, allowing for epidermal homing of melano-
cytes (D’Orazio et al., 2006; Kunisada et al., 1998). Albino mice
harboring a mutation in the tyrosinase gene were combined
with the K14-SCF transgene (Tyrc/c;K14-SCF mice) and served
as controls to evaluate whether the pigmentation afforded
by topical SIK inhibitor was dependent upon the canonical tyros-
inase-melanin pathway. Daily application of the SIK inhibitor HG
9-91-01 for 7 days caused robust darkening in Mc1re/e;K14-SCF
mice (Figures 2A and S2A). No visible change in skin pigmenta-
tion was observed in Mc1re/e;K14-SCF mice treated with vehicle
or in Tyrc/c;K14-SCF mice treated with vehicle or HG 9-91-01
(Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). Reflective colorimetry analysis
(Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage [CIE] L* white-black
color axis (Park et al., 1999)) revealed significant darkening
in Mc1re/e;K14-SCF mice treated with SIK inhibitor, but not in
vehicle-treated Mc1re/e;K14-SCF mice or in Tyrc/c;K14-SCF
mice treated with either SIK inhibitor or vehicle control (70%
ethanol, 30% propylene glycol) (Figure 2B). Fontana-Masson
staining, a specialized melanin stain, revealed strong induction
of melanin production in Mc1re/e;K14-SCF mice only in areas
treated with HG 9-91-01 (Figures 2C and S2D) but no pigment
induction in Mc1re/e;K14-SCF mice treated with vehicle (Fig-
ure 2C) or in albino (Tyrc/c;K14-SCF) mice treated with either
vehicle or SIK inhibitor (Figure S2C). Nuclear capping of
melanin-laden melanosomes was observed within epidermal
keratinocytes in Mc1re/e;K14-SCF mice treated with HG 9-91-
01 (indicated by white arrows) and represents a known sub-
cellular localization typical of physiologic skin pigmentation

 (Kobayashi et al., 1998) (Figure 2C). This feature suggests that
SIK-inhibitor treatment stimulates not only melanocytic pigment
synthesis but also the export of melanin in a fashion that closely
mimics the known pathway of UV melanogenesis. H&E staining
revealed normal morphology of HG 9-91-01-treated Mc1re/e;
K14-SCF (Figure 2C) and Tyrc/c;K14-SCF epidermis (Figure S2C).
NaOH lysis of skin samples (Wakamatsu and Ito, 2002) revealed
a visible increase in extractable eumelanin from Mc1re/e;K14-
SCF mice treated with HG 9-91-01, compared with all other
treatment groups (Figure 2D).
Darkening induced by topical application of HG 9-91-01 to
Mc1re/e;K14-SCF mice was progressive over 6 days of treatment
and gradually reversed over the 2 weeks after treatment was
stopped (Figure 2F). Skin pigmentation remained in its pretreat-
ment state 26 days later (40 days after treatment ended) (Fig-
ure 2E). No change was observed in Tyrc/c;K14-SCF mice during
treatment or 14 days after treatment was stopped (Figure 2G).
Forty days after treatment was stopped, Fontana-Masson stain-
ing of skin sections of Mc1re/e;K14-SCF mice and Tyrc/c;K14-
SCF mice revealed no differences between vehicle and treat-
ment groups, and H&E staining illustrated normal morphology
for all mice (Figure S2E). These findings combined with the
small-molecule and lipophilic nature of the SIK inhibitors led us
to further investigate the use of SIK inhibitors for topical eumela-
nization of human skin.
Second-Generation SIK Inhibitors Are as Efficacious in
Inducing the Pigmentation Pathway as HG 9-91-01
Since there are limitations to topical delivery of HG 9-91-01 into
human skin epidermis (Figures 4A–4D), we derived SIK inhibitors
designed to enhance passive epidermal permeation utilizing
Lipinski’s Rule of Five, which predicts greater absorption of

 compounds if they have fewer than five H-bond donors, fewer
than ten H-bond acceptors, a molecular weight less than
500 g/mol, and calculated log P (CLogP) less than 5 (Bos and
Meinardi, 2000; Choy and Prausnitz, 2011; Lipinski et al., 2001)
(Figure S3A). In an initial screen, two second-generation SIK in-
hibitors, YKL 06-061 and YKL 06-062, induced darkening as
measured by reflective colorimetry analysis after topical treat-
ment of human breast skin explants (Figure S3B). Furthermore,
both YKL 06-061 and YKL 06-062 have a lower molecular weight
than HG 9-91-01, and the more efficacious YKL 06-061 has a lip-
ophilicity closer to Lipinski’s Rule of Five, possibly explaining the
drug’s enhanced penetration capabilities (Figure S3A). Second-
generation inhibitors had half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values for the inhibition of SIK1, SIK2, and SIK3 that
were comparable to those of HG 9-91-01 (Figure 3A). To assess
the kinome selectivity information of new analogs, YKL-06-061
was screened across a panel of 468 human kinases at a concen-
tration of 1 mM using the KinomeScan methodology (DiscoverX).
YKL-06-061 exhibited an S(1) score of 0.02, with 16 kinases dis-
playing tight binding to it (Ambit scores of %1) (Figure 3B). As the
KinomeScan assays measure binding, we also performed enzy-
matic assays for these targets either in house or using the
SelectScreen Kinase Profiling Service at Thermo Fisher Scienti-
fic (Figure 3C). YKL-06-061 inhibited only one kinase, fyn-related
kinase (FRK), more strongly than SIKs, which demonstrates its

anticipate that YKL-06-062 has similar
kinase selectivity, considering their high
structural similarity. Similar to observa-
tions with HG 9-91-01, treatment of
normal
human
melanocytes
(Figures
S3C and S3D), UACC62 human mela-
noma cells, and UACC257 human mela-
noma cells (Figures S1B, S1C, S1E, and
S1F) with YKL 06-061 or YKL 06-062 for
3 hr yielded a dose-dependent increase
in MITF mRNA expression. Levels of
TRPM1 mRNA increased after MITF induction upon treatment
with YKL 06-061 or YKL 06-062 in normal human melanocytes
and UACC257 human melanoma cells (Figures S1G, S1H, S3E,
and S3F).
Topical SIK Inhibitors Induce Human Skin
Eumelanization
Treatment of human skin explants with passive topical applica-
tion of the second-generation SIK inhibitors, YKL 06-061 and
YKL 06-062, induced significant pigmentation after 8 days of
treatment (13/day), but no significant gross pigmentation was
observed in skin treated with HG 9-91-01 (Figure 4A). Fontana-
Masson staining revealed increased melanin content in skin
treated with YKL 06-061 or YKL 06-062 and marginally increased
melanin in skin treated with HG 9-91-01, as compared with con-
trol (Figure 4B). This effect was reproducible with independent
preparations of synthesized drugs applied passively (via pipette)
to the top of different human skin explants (Figure 4C and 4D).
Mechanical application of the first-generation SIK inhibitor HG
9-91-01, by rubbing via an applicator, induced significant gross
pigmentation (Figure 4E), and increased melanin content was
observed upon Fontana-Masson staining of skin sections (Fig-
ure 4F), suggesting that HG 9-91-01’s limited human skin pene-
tration can be, at least partially, overcome through mechanical
application. YKL 06-061 and YKL 06-062 did not require

 mechanical application (rubbing) to induce significant human
epidermal darkening.
DISCUSSION
These results illustrate the development and successful applica-
tion of small-molecule SIK inhibitors for topical induction of skin
pigmentation independently of UV irradiation in human skin. SIK
inhibitors were shown to induce enhanced expression of the
MITF transcription factor, which is known to regulate expression
of numerous pigment enzymes that promote biosynthesis of eu-
melanin. A new generation of SIK inhibitors was developed,
based on strategies for enhancing the likelihood of skin penetra-
tion through optimizing molecular size and lipophilicity. Two
such SIK-targeted inhibitors, YKL 06-061 and YKL 06-062,
were shown to induce similar responses both in vitro and when
applied to human skin explants. In addition to upregulating
mRNA levels of MITF and TRPM1, topical SIK inhibitors were
seen to trigger the transfer of melanosomes into epidermal
keratinocytes in a manner that recapitulates the perinuclear
capping

localization)

epidermal pigmentation. Thus, SIK-inhib-
itor treatments appear to induce not only
synthesis of melanin but also melanoso-
mal maturation, export, and localization
features, even after import into keratinocytes. These features
closely resemble the previously observed behavior of forskolin
treatment in red-haired mice (D’Orazio et al., 2006).
Topical
application
of
small-molecule,
UV-independent
pigment inducers has not yet been examined in humans and
would require careful considerations of safety. For example,
the induction of dark pigmentation is associated with the lowest
risk of most skin cancers in humans (Armstrong and Kricker,
2001; Pennello et al., 2000), and this pigment synthesis is
believed to be dependent upon MITF (Bertolotto et al., 1998).
However, fixed genomic mutation or amplification of the MITF
gene can be oncogenic in certain contexts (Bertolotto et al.,
2011; Garraway et al., 2005; Yokoyama et al., 2011). Reversible
upregulation of MITF, as reported here, is also likely to occur in
routine instances of UV tanning, and constitutive elevation of
MITF is likely in the skin of individuals with darker pigmentation
levels; neither would be anticipated to trigger genomic mutation
of the MITF gene. Analogously, transient administration of re-
combinant hematopoietic growth factors has not been associ-
ated with formation of oncogenic transformation or leukemia
(Dombret et al., 1995; Ohno et al., 1990). In mice, topical

 forskolin’s pigmentary rescue in ‘‘redheads’’ resulted in signifi-
cant protection from UV carcinogenesis, without apparent asso-
ciated toxicities over many months of treatment (D’Orazio et al.,
2006). A recent study has utilized injections of the synthetic
alpha-MSH analog, afamelanotide, for treatment of photosensi-
tivity associated with erythropoietic protoporphyria. Pigmented
lesions/melanoma were carefully evaluated and reported not to
occur at elevated risk (Langendonk et al., 2015).
Our in vivo studies demonstrate that topical SIK inhibitor can
be applied with localized SIK inhibition and no detected systemic
effects in mice (such as failure to thrive); and although it has been
previously shown that SIK1 inhibition leads to cell-cycle arrest in
epithelial cells, this was dependent on the presence of trans-
forming growth factor b (TGF-b) (Lo
¨ nn et al., 2012), and we
observed normal skin turnover with no morphological changes
of the skin (measured grossly or histologically, other than
pigment/color). During normal UV-induced tanning, MC1R acti-
vation leads to enhanced PKA activity (Newton et al., 2005),
and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of SIK1 (Takemori et al.,
2002), SIK2 (Horike et al., 2003), and SIK3 (Katoh et al., 2006) de-
creases their kinase activity. Since our compounds’ activity is
analogous to the on/off switch of UV-induced tanning, we
believe that it will be a safe, viable method of topical pigment
production, though it may be important to assure localized deliv-
ery to skin.
The half-life of melanin in skin is thought to be several weeks
and diminishes primarily after superficial keratinocyte sloughing.
Most epidermal melanin resides within keratinocytes after trans-
fer of melanosomes from melanocytes. Therefore, it is possible
that small-molecule approaches like that described here might
be achievable, or maintained, through intermittent pulse-dosing
strategies, thereby further limiting systemic drug exposure.
In conclusion, these studies describe a small-molecule, topical
approach to the rescue of eumelanin synthesis in a UV-
independent manner. Future studies will be needed to examine
the optimal applications of such agents in a variety of clinical
settings.

SIK inhibitors were dissolved in 30% propylene glycol plus 70% ethanol. HG 9-
91-01 was purchased from Medchem Express, and all other SIK inhibitors
were synthesized by the authors.
Kinome Profiling
Kinome profiling was performed using KinomeScan ScanMAX at a compound
concentration of 1 mM. Data are reported in the Supplemental Information.
Protocols are available from DiscoverX.
Kinase Activity In Vitro Assay
The biochemical activities against SIK2 were measured with a Caliper-based
mobility shift assay (PerkinElmer).
Real-Time qPCR
The relative expression of each gene was calculated with 7500 Fast Real-
Time PCR System software, which utilizes Ct normalized to mRNA levels of
RPL11 to calculate relative expression. Results are reported relative to control
cells.
Mice
C57BL/6J Mc1re/e mice were crossed with K14-SCF transgenic mice, and
C57BL/6J Tyrc2j/c2j were crossed with K14-SCF transgenic mice (D’Orazio
et al., 2006; Kunisada et al., 1998). Mixed-gender adult mice were used.
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional
policies and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved
protocols.
Human Tissue Samples
Skin samples considered surgical waste were obtained de-identified from
healthy donors undergoing reconstructive surgery, according to institutional
regulation.
Colorimeter Measurements
Differences in darkening of the skin were measured by reflective colorimetry
(Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage [CIE] L* white-black color axis) utiliz-
ing a CR-400 Colorimeter (Minolta) calibrated to a white standard background
calibration plate, with calibration date set to Y 93.1, x 0.3133, y 0.3194, before
each set of measurements.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
Statistical significance of differences between experimental groups for
in vitro experiments of cell lines treated with varying doses of SIKi or vehicle
control were assessed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple compari-
sons post-test. In vitro time course experiments were assessed by
repeated-measures one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
post-test.
Statistical significance for colorimeter readings in Figure 2B was determined
by multiple t test analysis between day 0 and day 7 for each treatment group,
with the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yeku-
tieli to correct for false discovery rate (FDR)—desired FDR (Q) = 1%—with no
assumption of consistent SD. Statistical significance for colorimeter readings
in Figure S3B were assessed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple
comparisons post-test.
For the G361 melanoma cells transduced with LKB1, a one-way
ANOVA was used, with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test to assess the
statistical significance of LKB1 expression and a two-tailed paired t test
to assess the statistical significance of MITF induction with SIK-inhibitor
treatment.
Statistical significance of differences between experimental groups for
in vivo time course experiments was assessed by two-way ANOVAs with
Sidak’s multiple comparisons test.
Multiplicity-adjusted p values were reported for each comparison, and
differences of means were considered significant if p < 0.05.
