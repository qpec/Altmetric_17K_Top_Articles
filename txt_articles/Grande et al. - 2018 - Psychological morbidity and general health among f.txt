Abstract
Background: Family carers provide vital support for patients towards end-of-life, but caregiving has considerable impact on carers’ 
own health. The scale of this problem is unknown, as previous research has involved unrepresentative samples or failed to fully 
capture caregiving close to death.
Aim: To quantify level of psychological morbidity and general health among a census sample of carers of people with cancer at end-
of-life, compared to population reference data.
Design: National 4-month post-bereavement postal census survey of family carers of people who died from cancer, retrospectively 
measuring carers’ psychological health (General Health Questionnaire-12) and general health (EuroQoL EQ-Visual Analogue Scale) 
during the patient’s last 3 months of life.
Participants: N = 1504 (28.5%) of all 5271 people who registered the death of a relative from cancer in England during 2 weeks in 2015 
compared with data from the Health Survey for England 2014 (N = 6477–6790).
Results: Psychological morbidity at clinically significant levels (General Health Questionnaire-12 ⩾4) was substantially higher among 
carers than the general population (83% vs 15%), with prevalence five to seven times higher across all age groups. Overall, carers’ 
general health scores were lower than population scores, median 75 (interquartile range, 50–80) versus 80 (interquartile range, 
70–90), but differences were more marked at younger ages. Female carers had worse psychological morbidity and general health 
than male carers.
Conclusion: Levels of psychological morbidity among family carers during end-of-life caregiving are far higher than indicated by 
previous research, indicating a substantial public health problem. Consistent assessment and support for carers to prevent breakdown 
in caregiving may produce cost savings in long term.

What is already known about the topic?
•
•
Family carers make a crucial contribution to end-of-life care, but existing research indicates they suffer worse mental 
health than other carers, study controls, patients and the general population, with prevalence estimates for clinically 
significant depression at 39%–57% and anxiety at 34%–47%.
•
•
Previous findings are unlikely to be representative of the population of carers providing end-of-life care, as studies have 
either recruited carers through specialist or palliative care settings where carers may be better supported or have failed 
to fully capture care during the final months of life.

What this paper adds?
•
•
This study provides the most representative data on carer health during end-of-life caregiving for people with cancer to 
date, based on a national census retrospective survey.
•
•
Carers’ level of clinically significant psychological morbidity (83%) during caregiving was found to be five to seven times 
higher than general population levels, far higher than indicated by previous evidence.
•
•
Carers’ general health during caregiving was lower than for the general population, but differences were more marked 
among younger carers with scores converging towards older age.
Implications for practice, theory or policy
•
•
The prevalence of clinical morbidity among carers providing end-of-life care indicates a substantial, but hitherto hidden, 
public health problem.
•
•
Findings emphasise a need for more consistent assessment and support for carers as part of end-of-life care, with sign-
posting to more specialist mental health input where needed.
Introduction
Family carers make a crucial contribution to end-of-life 
care, providing substantial hours of care, offsetting health 
service costs and facilitating patient choice. Nationally 
representative samples indicate that the majority of fam-
ily carers (62%) provide up to 19 h care per week in 
England.1 However, during end-of-life care, the hours of 
caregiving escalate to a median of nearly 70 h care per 
week.2 Supporting patients to stay at home at end-of-life 
could generate considerable healthcare cost savings; life-
time healthcare costs are greatest in the last year of life 
and hospital care accounts for the largest component.3 
Furthermore, end-of-life care at home is the preference of 
the majority of patients.4 The most important factor in 
sustaining end-of-life care at home and meeting patient 
preferences is the availability of family carers.5,6 However, 
end-of-life caregiving substantially affects carers’ own 
health: negative impacts from caregiving increase pro-
gressively with care hours provided7 and severity of 
patients’ disease.8,9 During caregiving, carers of palliative 
patients experience greater impacts on emotional 
health,10 quality of life11 and physical health10–12 com-
pared to carers of non-palliative patients. End-of-life car-
ers also report worse mental and physical health than 
non-caregiving controls,13,14 and worse mental health 
compared to the general population,8,14–18 although some 
of these studies show end-of-life carers to have similar or 
better physical health than the norm.15–17 End-of-life car-
ers may also suffer more anxiety18,19 or depression20 than 
patients themselves. Overall reported results seem to 
show the greatest and most consistent impacts on carers’ 
psychological health and patterns appear very similar 
across English-speaking countries and Europe.8–21
Previous research does not enable us to quantify the 
level of psychological impact on the end-of-life carer popu-
lation. The majority of studies have recruited carers from 
oncology/tertiary care15,19–21 or palliative care ser-
vices.11,13,14,16–18 Their reported rates of mental ill health 
among end-of-life carers during caregiving are high, rang-
ing from 34% to 47% for anxiety15,18,19,21 and 39% to 57% 
for clinical depression,14,20 based on standard measures. 
However, generalisation from these studies to the end-of-
life carer population should be cautious; specialist services 
may produce better outcomes than non-specialist ser-
vices, but those referred to them may also have the most 
complex needs. Only Dumont et al.8 recruited both through 
generalist and specialist care, and reported carer psycho-
logical morbidity at 41%–62% (increasing with decreasing 
patient function), but again did not use population level 
data. There have been only two end-of-life carer popula-
tion studies,10,12 both using secondary analysis of single 
item, non-standard scales for impact, for example, on 
‘emotional stress’,10 preventing comparison with standard 
measurements of psychological morbidity. Furthermore, 
most studies have included considerable proportions of 
carers of patients who are not in the final 3–4 months of 
life and who may still be relatively well.10,14–21
We therefore lack robust, population level data on the 
health impact of end-of-life care on caregivers. Information 
on the health consequences of end-of-life caregiving, and 
the number and types of carers affected, are needed for 
appropriate service planning. Registers of end-of-life car-
ers are often incomplete and screening for health prob-
lems ad hoc. Ensuring that carers are able to continue 
caregiving is ultimately about supporting the patient. This 
is particularly important as an increase in the percentage 
of family carers within the population1 and a rising num-
ber of deaths22 are likely to increase the numbers involved 
in end-of-life family caregiving. There are already an esti-
mated 500,000 family carers per annum providing end-of-
life care in the United Kingdom.23 It is important to 
establish the level of health problems within this popula-
tion to inform service developments required to support 
carers to sustain end-of-life care and to address carers’ 
own health needs during caregiving.

The aims of this article are (1) to quantify the level of 
psychological health problems and general health among a 
population sample of carers during caregiving for some-
one with cancer in their last 3 months of life and (2) to 
compare our carer data with reference data for England for 
comparable age and gender groups. An in-depth analysis 
of predictors of carers’ psychological and general health 
outcomes will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.
Method
The design was a nationwide, cross-sectional census retro-
spective post-bereavement survey of family members of 
people who died from cancer. Methods have been further 
described elsewhere.2 This retrospective design enables 
access to a representative sample of end-of-life carers inde-
pendent of their contact with services and permits assess-
ment of health status during a consistent, comparable time 
period closely before death. In contrast, prospective stud-
ies normally have to rely on recruitment through selected 
services, can only control timing of measurement relative 
to death through prolonged longitudinal design and have 
high attrition close to death. Carers were surveyed 4 months 
post-bereavement as the optimum time point to allow 
appropriate distance to the death, yet ensure good accu-
racy of recall. Survey data were compared with prospective 
data from a representative sample of the population from 
the Health Survey for England (HSE) 2014.
Sample and recruitment
The Office for National statistics (ONS) drew sample details 
from Death Certificates of all people domiciled in the UK 
who registered the death of a relative from cancer 
(International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision 
(ICD-10) codes C000-C979) between 1 and 16 May 2015 in 
England (N = 5271). Exclusions were death of a child (<18 
years old); death occurred somewhere other than home, 
hospice, hospital or care home; reported to the coroner; 
person registering death was not a relative; address of 
relative was missing; or address, gender or age of deceased 
was missing. While the eventual aim is to expand the sur-
vey to carers of people with conditions other than cancer, 
we initially tested the method with a smaller, defined 
group of carers to ascertain how feasible it was to ask a 
census sample of bereaved carers detailed questions 
about their caregiving via postal survey. We here focused 
on cancer as the condition which most commonly has 
been the subject of palliative and end-of-life research, 
enabling comparison with previous studies.8,11,13,15–21
The ONS sent survey packs (invitation letter, informa-
tion sheet, decline slip and survey) and two subsequent 
reminders to non-responders (t1 = letter and decline slip, 
t2 = second survey pack) to the relative reporting the 
death. Packs were sent 4 months post-bereavement and 
reminders at 1-month intervals. The invitation letter clari-
fied that the survey was about the support provided by 
family and friends for people with cancer at the end of 
life. If recipients did not feel they were the best person to 
complete the survey, they were invited to pass it on to 
someone more appropriate. Responses were made to the 
research team by post, online or via telephone interview.
The University of Manchester’s Research Ethics com-
mittee approved the study (Ref: 14430; 12.02.2015). 
Completion and return of a postal or online survey was 
taken as informed consent to participate. Participants in 
telephone interviews gave verbal consent. All data received 
by the research team were fully anonymised and disclo-
sure controlled. Data from the HSE are publicly available 
through the UK Data Service to researchers registering a 
specific project (Usage number 103114).
Data collection
The survey included questions on demographics, dece-
dents’ diagnosis, participants’ relationship to the dece-
dent and care provided.2
Psychological health was measured through the General 
Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12,24 a 12-item standardised 
measure of psychological morbidity. Items include being 
able to make decisions or concentrate, feeling under strain 
or thinking of oneself as worthless. Responses are made 
on 4-point scales. A higher score indicates worse morbid-
ity. General health was measured using the EuroQoL 
EQ-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS),25 a single-item scale of 
health with 0 being ‘the worst health’ and 100 being ‘the 
best health you can imagine’. Discussions with the GHQ 
and EQ-VAS licence holders established that these tools 
could be used for retrospective data collection, with minor 
amendments to wording, and that there was a precedent 
for this. However, licence constraints meant different time 
frames had to be adopted between these tools: respond-
ents were asked to consider how they felt on a typical day 
towards the end of the decedent’s life in terms of the last 
few weeks of their relative’s life for the GHQ-12 and the 
last 3 months for the EQ-VAS.
GHQ-12 and EQ-VAS permit comparison with the HSE. 
HSE is conducted annually using a multi-stage, stratified 
probability sample, representative of the English popula-
tion resident in private households.26 Data were collected 
via face-to-face, computer-assisted interviews with a 
trained researcher. A separate, self-completion question-
naire was administered in the presence of the interviewer 
which included the GHQ-12 and EQ-5D VAS to measure 
how they felt ‘over the past few weeks’ and ‘today’, 
respectively.26
For our own data set, ONS supplied anonymised, linked 
data for the whole sampling frame consisting of age and 
gender of deceased, final underlying cause and contributing 
causes of death (ICD-10 codes), place of death, and area 
 1608

index of multiple deprivation (IMD) for the decedent to ena-
ble assessment of the representativeness of participants.
Analysis
Differences between participants and non-participants 
on variables supplied by the ONS were investigated using 
chi-square for categorical variables and analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) for continuous variables (reported in detail 
elsewhere).2
For GHQ-12 4-point scales, we used the scoring 
method of 0-0-1-1 with total scores ranging from 0 to 12. 
Research indicates this is the better method for differen-
tiating caseness for mental illness, with a score of ⩾4 
being the optimal threshold within England with 85% 
sensitivity and 89% specificity for clinically significant 
psychological morbidity.24
Study findings were compared with HSE 2014 data26 
using descriptive statistics: GHQ-12 caseness was pre-
sented as percentages and GHQ-12 and EQ-VAS scores as 
means with standard deviations (SD) and medians with 
interquartile ranges (IQR). No imputation or other statisti-
cal correction was made of missing data, which ranged 
from 1.4% (gender) to 14.5% (EQ-VAS).
Results
Participants
Surveys were completed by 1504 carers (28.5%). 
Participants were predominantly female (64%) with a 
median age of 60 (IQR, 52–69) years, mainly caring for a 
spouse (45%) or parent (43%), and 96% defined them-
selves as White. Twenty-five percent had a university 
degree and an additional 22% had education beyond age 
16. Median patient age was 76 (IQR, 67–84) years, 53% 
were male, and 36% died at home, 30% in hospital, 20% in 
hospice and 15% in a care home. Main primary causes of 
death were lung cancer (20%), colorectal (10%), prostate 
(8%) and breast cancer (7%). Distribution over IMD quin-
tiles, from most to least deprived, was 14%, 17%, 22%, 
23% and 25%, respectively. Compared with non-partici-
pants, participants were significantly more likely to have 
registered the death of patients dying at home and from 
less deprived areas (see Rowland et al.2 for further 
details). Of those who responded to questions about time 
spent on support and care for their relative (1365/1504), 
99% reported spending some time, with the median time 
spent being 69:30 h per week (IQR, 28:37–115:15) in their 
relative’s last 3 months of life (see Rowland et al.2 for fur-
ther details on hours and tasks).
Carer health outcomes
Figure 1 shows total percentages for clinically significant 
psychological morbidity for carers during end-of-life car-
egiving compared with the population. End-of-life carers’ 
caseness for psychological morbidity was five to seven 
times higher than for the corresponding population age 
groups (Table 1).27 Furthermore, carers’ median GHQ-12 
score was 6–8 across age groups, well above the cutoff 
point for caseness of 4, and in clear contrast to a consist-
ent population median of 0. Caseness was highest among 
younger carers (ages 25–54: 89%–92%), but reduced with 
age (ages 55–74: 80%–82%; ages 75+: 74%). In contrast, 
likely cases of psychological morbidity in the population 
remained fairly consistent across ages (11%–17%). Male 
carers consistently fared better than women carers on 
GHQ-12 caseness and scores (differences of 7%–19% 
points and 1–3 in median scores, respectively), except for 
similar results at age 35–44. While this reflects population 
gender differences for psychological morbidity, both male 
and female carers had rates of caseness considerably 
above population rates.
Carers’ general health scores during end-of-life car-
egiving were generally lower than population scores 
(Table 2), although median scores converged towards 
older age, with carers age 75+ scoring better than popu-
lation counterparts. Carers’ median EQ-VAS health score 
was lowest among younger carers (ages 25–44: score 63–
70) and then remained level (score 75) at older ages. In 
contrast, population scores were highest for ages 25–44 
(score 85), but decreased very slightly with age, with a 
drop to score 70 for age 75+. Male carers had better 
median EQ-VAS scores than female carers across all age 
groups (differences of 5–20 in median score). In contrast, 
median EQ-VAS population scores were very similar for 
men and women.
If we consider the sub-sample of the general popula-
tion that reported providing help to anyone with prob-
lems relating to physical/ mental ill health or disability/ 
old age, caseness within this group was 12%–28% and 
EQ-VAS median scores were 75–80 (data not shown).27

Discussion
Main findings
Carers’ retrospective reports in this census-based study 
indicate that prevalence of caseness for psychological 
morbidity was five to seven times higher among carers 
during end-of-life caregiving compared to the general 
population.27 Their prevalence of psychological morbidity 
(83%) was also considerably higher than for end-of-life 
carers in previous studies (34%–47% for anxiety15,18,19,21 
and 39%–57% for clinical depression);14,20 for general car-
ers in England who provide ⩾20 h of care per week (34% 
for women and 19% for men, based on GHQ-12);7 and for 
those in HSE 2014 reporting helping someone with a 
health problem or disability (12%–28%).27 The general 
health of carers during end-of-life caregiving was also 
overall lower than within the general population.27 
Differences were greatest among younger age groups 
(15–23 EQ-VAS score difference, ages 25–44), but con-
verged with increasing age, with carers age 75+ scoring 
slightly higher than the population.
Female carers had worse psychological health than 
male carers, in line with previous research and general 
population data.9,27 Women carers overall also had worse 
general health than men, whereas the population data 
showed no similar consistent gender difference.27 The 
carer gender difference between men and women in both 
psychological and general health may indicate that women 
are disproportionally affected in their carer role. Women 
are more likely to undertake end-of-life caregiving and at 
more intense levels than men.28
Strengths and limitations
Our study design has generated the most representative 
population level information on end-of-life carer health to 
date, being based on a census sample of all cancer deaths 
in England in a defined period. The retrospective design 
enabled us to capture carer data for all cancer deaths 
regardless of patients’ access to specialist or palliative care 
and to gain information on the period closest to death, thus 
overcoming the limitations of previous studies10,11,13–21 and 
providing a more realistic picture of the true impact of end-
of-life caregiving on carer health. Our findings show preva-
lence of clinically significant psychological morbidity to be 
far higher among end-of-life carers during final months of 
caregiving than indicated by previous research. Given the 
consistency in findings from carer studies across Europe 
and English-speaking countries, similarly high levels of psy-
chological morbidity are likely to be present during caregiv-
ing in the final months of life across these nations.
In contrast, we found carers’ general health to be simi-
lar to or better than the population among some age 
groups. Licence restrictions for the standard measure-
ment tools used in our study meant carers reported on 
their general health for the patients’ last 3 months and 
psychological health for their last few weeks, therefore 
the psychological health scores may be worse because 
they represent the time closer to death. However, find-
ings correspond with previous studies where differences 
in psychological health appear more consistent and 
marked than for physical health.15–17
The study was limited to carers of patients who died 
from cancer. This makes it similar to other palliative carer 
studies, where cancer is predominant.8,11,13,15–21 Cancer 
furthermore represents a substantial proportion of all 
deaths (28.5%).29 However, our findings may be less repre-
sentative of end-of-life family caregiving for conditions 
with different disease trajectories to cancer where, for 
instance, a clear end-of-life period is more difficult to 
define.30 Within the study sample, survey participants 
were similar to non-participants for patient age, gender, 
and diagnosis. However, carers with greater socioeco-
nomic status and resources to deal with caregiving may be 
over-represented, as participants were more likely to care 
for patients from less deprived areas who died at home 
than non-participants. Participants may therefore have 
better general health than other end-of-life carers.31 Ethnic 
minorities also appeared under-represented compared to 
the population. Furthermore, we do not know if survey 
response rates were affected by the level of psychological 
morbidity being experienced by carers. Nevertheless, if 
survey participants were the only ones to suffer clinically 
significant psychological morbidity, caseness among carers 
in the total census sample would still be 23%, well above 
the population level. However, it is more plausible that 
those with worse psychological health were less likely to 
respond to a postal survey and therefore that psychologi-
cal morbidity in the carer population is truly high and 
potentially higher than indicated by our results.
Finally, the retrospective data collection may affect the 
accuracy of reporting. We collected carers’ retrospective 
reports of health via self-completed postal questionnaires 
and compared these with HSE contemporary reports of 
health via self-completed questionnaires in the presence 
of an interviewer. A recent review of the health litera-
ture32 found strong agreement between patients’ retro-
spective and contemporary physical and mental health 
reports for a majority of comparisons, but with stronger 
agreement for shorter intervals (<3 months). The review 
found no consistency in the direction of differences 
between retrospective and contemporary measurement: 
retrospective scores were better than contemporary 
scores in one study, worse in two, no different in two and 
dependent on the measure in one study. Therefore, the 
evidence so far does not suggest that retrospective meas-
urement will lead to inflated measures of poor health. 
However, we need to consider whether carers’ post-
bereavement distress in our study may affect their retro-
spective reports of health and make scores more negative.

Evidence shows that pre-bereavement psychological mor-
bidity in fact is a strong predictor of post-bereavement 
distress.9,33 Therefore, even if there is some influence of 
carers’ current state on their recollection, reports are still 
likely to give a reasonable indication of carers’ psychologi-
cal health pre-bereavement.9,33 Nevertheless, given the 
importance of retrospective data collection for end-of-life 
care research, further study of the relationship between 
prospective and retrospective reports is warranted. To 
date, few studies have addressed this issue even in the 
health literature as a whole.32
What this study adds
This study found far higher prevalence of psychological 
morbidity among carers during end-of-life caregiving than 
indicated by previous research,14,15,18–21 with clinically sig-
nificant morbidity being the norm. This represents a large, 
hitherto unrecognised public health burden, the conse-
quences of which need to be further established. If results 
are representative of end-of-life carers in England in gen-
eral, over 400,000 of the estimated half a million end-of-
life carers per annum23 may be at risk for substantial 
psychological morbidity, with effects likely to carry on into 
bereavement.9,33 If only representative of cancer carers, 
over 100,000 p.a. may still be affected. Women and 
younger carers may be particularly affected and warrant 
additional attention.
Carers may willingly accept a health risk associated with 
caring for a loved one at end of life and the substantial hours 
entailed.34 We should be careful not to pathologise the 
impact of caregiving, but must ensure carers are not ‘broken’ 
by the experience. Evidence indicates that the impact of car-
egiving can be mitigated through good, early service support 
and the addressing of carer support needs during caregiv-
ing.35–38 Therefore, considerable benefit may be gained from 
relatively small-scale investment to ensure carers are consist-
ently assessed and supported in their caregiving role as part 
of existing end-of-life provision, with signposting to more 
specialist mental health input where needed. It is promising 
that the new Carers Action Plan 2018–202039 for England 
focuses on identification of carers within primary care and 
make further specific reference to end-of-life care. However, 
this plan largely focuses on social care provision, whereas 
end-of-life carers need considerable support from healthcare 
practitioners to meet the challenges of caring for a dying per-
son and preserving their own health.40 In reality, healthcare 
practitioners will naturally remain focused on the patient, 
particularly in the face of mounting healthcare service pres-
sures. Therefore, support that meets the need for carers dur-
ing end-of-life care is unlikely to materialise unless separate 
space and provision are made for consistent assessment and 
support for carers as part of end-of-life healthcare provision. 
Carers are our biggest resource in supporting patients at end 
of life. If they are stretched beyond breaking point, there 
would be considerable economic, health and social care cost 
implications, for example, in terms of replacing lost hours of 
patient care, increased end-of-life acute care admissions, 
carer health problems pre- and post-bereavement and pro-
ductivity losses if carers can no longer participate in employ-
ment. Investment in support for carers may therefore lead to 
considerable gains in the longer term. Future research should 
consider end-of-life caregiving for carers of patients dying 
from conditions other than cancer and perspectives of ethnic 
minorities and investigate the effectiveness and cost-effec-
tiveness of models of end-of-life carer support in maintaining 
carer psychological health and functioning, sustaining care at 
home and preventing acute inpatient admissions.
