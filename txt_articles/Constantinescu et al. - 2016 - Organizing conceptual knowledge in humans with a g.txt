Abstract
It has been hypothesized that the brain organizes concepts into a mental map, allowing conceptual 
relationships to be navigated in a similar fashion to space. Grid cells use a hexagonally-symmetric 
code to organize spatial representations and are the likely source of a precise hexagonal symmetry 
in the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. Humans navigating conceptual two-
dimensional knowledge showed the same hexagonal signal in a strikingly similar set of brain 
regions to those activated during spatial navigation. This grid-like signal is consistent across 
sessions acquired within an hour and more than a week apart. Our findings suggest that global 
relational codes may be used to organize non-spatial conceptual representations and that these 
codes may have hexagonal grid-like pattern when conceptual knowledge is laid out in two 
continuous dimensions.
Humans have a remarkable capacity for generalizing experiences to novel situations(1, 2). It 
has been hypothesized that this capacity relies on a ‘cognitive map’, allowing conceptual 
relationships to be navigated in a similar fashion to space(3–6). Grid cells use a hexagonally-
symmetric code to organize spatial representations(7). Here we ask whether conceptual 
knowledge may also be organized by grid-like codes.
Human grid cells have been identified during intra-operative recordings(8) and are the likely 
source of a precise six-fold (hexagonal) symmetry in the functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) signal, as a function of movement direction during virtual navigation(9–
11).This hexagonal signal varies depending on whether the direction of moving in space is 
aligned or misaligned with the orientation of the grid (Fig. 1D-E). Such a signal is a precise 
and unusual prediction for fMRI (Supplementary text): it is predicted in the bulk activity 
because grid cells share a common grid axis (12–14), and conjunctive grid cells fire faster on

 average when movement is aligned to this axis (9). It pertains to the moving direction and 
cannot be explained by any characteristics of the currently experienced visual scene. It is 
hexagonal and therefore does not align on average to the cardinal directions. Its temporal 
waveform is different in every scan and every subject (Fig. S4) and thus cannot be easily 
predicted by imaging artefacts (Supplementary text and Table S1).
This grid-like signal is not unique to the entorhinal cortex, but can be measured during 
spatial navigation in prescribed parts of the medial frontal, medial parietal and lateral 
temporal cortices(9). Despite no report in rodents of grid cells outside the hippocampal 
formation, direct recordings during brain surgery in humans have confirmed grid-like firing 
patterns in some of these areas(8). This same network of brain regions, often referred to as 
the 'default mode network'(15), is also regularly activated in non-spatial tasks that involve 
the manipulation of conceptual knowledge, such as memory(16), imagination(17), scene 
construction(18), valuation(19) and theory of mind (20), and in situations when subjects 
must generalize learnt concepts to novel situations(1, 2, 21).
The ability to interact with knowledge in this flexible and generalizable fashion is the central 
advantage of maintaining an explicit cognitive map(3). Together with the regions’ 
established role in non-spatial conceptual generalization, the finding of grid-like activity in 
these brain regions during spatial navigation therefore raises the possibility of common 
neural coding mechanisms for storing spatial and conceptual representations. Indeed, this 
hypothesis is strengthened by the findings that hippocampal cells (analogous to rodent place-
cells) encode individual concepts in humans (22) and sound frequency in rodents(23), and 
that rodent grid cell coding may not be restricted to spatial dimensions, but also represent 
time(24).
We used fMRI to test if humans use a hexagonally symmetric code when navigating through 
abstract conceptual representations. We designed a task analogous to the one used for 
navigation in physical space(9), with the notable difference that our dimensions were 
organized in an abstract, rather than physical, space.
Twenty-eight healthy subjects performed a stimulus-outcome (S-O) learning task where they 
learnt that bird stimuli(25) were associated with different Christmas symbols (Fig. 1A). The 
study therefore resembles other S-O learning tasks except that here, the bird stimuli were not 
independent fractals or symbols but, instead, they varied according to two continuous 
dimensions: the lengths of the neck and legs. Each stimulus could therefore be described 
within a two-dimensional conceptual “bird space” (Fig. 1B). Even though the features of this 
“bird space” were lengths as in physical maps, here they had to be extracted from a one-
dimensional (vertical) visual space where different stimuli did not form any angles (Fig. 1A) 
and transformed into a two-dimensional conceptual map (Fig. 1B).
Participants had extensive experience of the bird space the day before scanning (26). Briefly, 
we first trained them to morph birds with specific neck:legs ratios, using a non-spatial 
controller (Fig. S1). Next, the participants learned which bird stimuli were paired with 
outcomes by freely morphing the neck and legs dimensions. The outcome symbols would 
appear on screen whenever the morph matched the associated bird (Fig. S2). This ensured

 that subjects became familiar with the entire bird space and not just with the S-O pairings. 
Indeed, participants progressively refined the locations of the outcomes through training 
(Fig. 1F and Fig. S6). We periodically tested their knowledge of the bird space by asking 
them to find specific outcomes from arbitrary start positions, by correctly choosing the 
appropriate neck:legs ratio. When asked to make such ballistic movements, subjects 
significantly increased their precision through training, and therefore learned to visualize the 
target bird (Fig. 1G and Fig. S7). In the scanner, participants continued to improve 
performance each day, possibly because they received fresh training before each day’s 
scanning (Fig. 1G and Fig. S8).
Each subject participated in 2-4 separate fMRI sessions, spanning two separate days, at least 
one week apart. In each trial during scanning, subjects watched a video of a bird morphing 
according to a pre-defined neck:legs ratio (Fig. 1C, Movie S1). They were then instructed to 
imagine the outcome if the bird continued to morph with the same neck:legs ratio. In some 
trials, they had to choose one of three offered outcomes: two outcomes they were trained 
with and a “no outcome” option (black square). Participants reached a performance of 72.8 
± 1.0 % accuracy in predicting outcomes, and 0 out of 28 reported conceiving of the 
relationships between birds or outcomes as lying in a spatial map(26).
With the ambition to test whether the fMRI signal had hexagonal symmetry, as a proxy for 
grid cells, we ensured that the orientation of the trajectories for movement in bird-space 
were dissociated from the properties of the visual scene. That is, trajectories with the same 
orientation were formed by different stimuli, and trajectories with different orientations 
could pass through the same stimulus. Indeed, the critical hexagonal symmetry regressors 
described below never shared more than 5% variance with any tested basic visual property 
of the stimuli, outcomes, or behavioral accuracy in any subject (Fig. 1I). The trajectories 
were sampled evenly across directions both in sum, and when separated according to 
outcome (Fig. 1H, S5).
Despite the absence of any hexagonal modulation of these confounding factors, we found a 
hexagonal modulation effect in the neural activity. We first identified hexagonally symmetric 
signals across the whole brain and then we focused on those regions where the effect was 
strongest. This approach allowed us to test in an unbiased fashion if this hexagonal 
symmetry had a consistent grid angle across two sessions acquired on the same day, and 
more than a week apart.
To identify brain regions sensitive to hexagonal symmetry, we used a Z-transformed F-
statistic to test for a significant modulation of the fMRI signal by any linear combination of 
sin(6θ) and cos(6θ), where θ is the trajectory angle in bird space ((26) and Fig. S3). We 
found hexagonal symmetry in a network of brain regions that overlapped anatomically with 
the network found during navigation in physical space(8, 9) and with the default-mode 
network(15) (Fig. 2A, Fig. S10). However, although these brain regions all survived whole-
brain cluster correction, this quadrature test could overestimate the Z-scores(26). Thus, we 
did not use this test for statistical inference per se but rather to create orthogonal regions of 
interest that allowed us to test in an unbiased fashion if the grid angle was consistent across 
separate experimental sessions. This was possible because the quadrature test was

 independent from the phase of the periodic signal, that is, the grid angle. We focused on 
brain regions where grid cells have been recorded in humans during spatial tasks(8), that is, 
the anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and entorhinal cortex (ERH).
Using the peak coordinate of the hexagonal modulation signal in the mPFC located ventrally 
(vmPFC), we found that subjects with greater hexagonal modulation had a more accurate 
performance at the task (Fig. 2B). This region has also been shown to correlate with the 
performance in memory and conceptual knowledge tests(1, 21). As previously described for 
spatial hexagonal symmetries(9, 10), we next asked whether the grid angle to which this 
hexagonal modulation was aligned was consistent between separate experimental sessions. 
We thus used the data from one session to estimate the grid angle for a given participant, 
using the beta coefficients for the sin(6θ) and cos(6θ) regressors ((26)and Fig. S3). We then 
took the data from a separate session and looked for differences in activation between trials 
in which the trajectories were aligned versus misaligned to this hexagonal grid. This was 
achieved using the regressor cos(6[θ(t) - φ]), where θ(t) is the trajectory orientation in trial t 
and φ is the mean grid orientation across the region on interest(9, 10). This “cross-
validation” procedure was counter-balanced across sessions. We then performed a one-
sample t-test across the group on the resulting regression coefficients.
Using this approach, we tested for hexagonal consistency between separate sessions 
acquired half an hour apart. We found such an effect at the whole brain level in the vmPFC 
(Fig. 3A, left). To test if this effect was a function of the presence of outcomes, we included 
in the design matrix a confound regressor that modeled out the effect of outcomes. We found 
that the map did not change (Fig. S11). Again, the consistency effect correlated with 
behavior in subjects who performed better at the task (Fig 3A, right). Thus, we replicated the 
finding that participants with more grid-like representations performed better at the task, 
using two independent analyses. The same neural signal was not predicted by the speed of 
learning of the task during training ((26) and Fig. 1F, G). Grid-like activity was therefore 
related to the current performance rather than the trajectory of learning.
Next, to examine the pattern underlying this hexagonal effect, we separated all aligned (red) 
and misaligned (grey) trajectories ((26) and Fig. 1D). The signal in the vmPFC was 
significantly higher for aligned than misaligned trajectories (Fig. 3B). The same pattern 
appeared in ERH (Fig. 3C). This effect was significant only for six-fold but not control 
four-, five-, seven- and eight-fold symmetries (Fig. 3B-C, right panels).
We also tested for hexagonal consistency between separate sessions acquired more than a 
week apart. We found a significant effect in the vmPFC (Fig. 4A). When grouping together 
within- and between-day data, the consistency effect was strongest in the vmPFC (Fig. 4B). 
Moreover, we found hexagonal consistency also between the ERH and vmPFC, suggesting 
that different brain regions may contain grid-like activity that is aligned to the same angle 
(Fig 4C). Again, all these effects were significant only in hexagonal but not control 
symmetries (Fig. 4, right panels).
Whilst the coarse nature of the fMRI signal forces caution in making conclusions at the level 
of neuronal codes, we have reported an unusually precise hexagonal modulation of the fMRI

 signal during non-spatial cognition. When subjects perform this abstract cognitive task, this 
signal exists in a strikingly similar set of brain regions to those observed when subjects run 
in a virtual reality spatial environment((9) and Fig. S9), despite profound differences in the 
cognitive and perceptual demands of the two tasks. The hexagonal grid is consistently 
oriented across sessions that are acquired both half an hour and more than a week apart. 
Together, this evidence suggests that grid-like codes that are known to underlie spatial 
navigation, and recently discovered in the temporal dimension(24), can also be used to 
organize abstract knowledge of the type that is difficult to study in nonhuman species. In the 
event that such conceptual grid cells can be recorded directly, it will be of interest to know 
whether they share relationships (such as relative phases) across spatial and conceptual 
tasks, suggesting conceptual tasks can be solved by subconsciously mapping abstract 
dimensions onto pre-existing spatial maps, or whether new organizations can emerge to 
represent conceptual problems. It will also be informative to study how such cells behave in 
conceptual problems that are not easily mapped onto continuous 2-dimensional spaces(27, 
28).

(B) Example trajectory in abstract space. A location in this abstract space was represented 
by a bird stimulus. A trajectory was equivalent to visually morphing one bird into another

the legs and the neck (Movie S1). Subjects were not consciously aware that these 
associations could be organized in a continuous “bird space”. (C) Example trial

the “collect” task, participants made significant improvements in training day 2 compared to 
training day 1: the percentage of trials with an angle error < 15° (t33=2.37, * p<0.05) and 
with only one transition increased (t33=2.55, * p<0.05). In the “recall” task, participants 
made significantly more correct responses in day 2 compared to day 1 (t41=3.89, ***

tested if the sin(6θ) and cos(6θ) regressors correlated with multiple confounding factors. 
These regressors did not correlate with the start neck, start legs, end neck and end legs 
lengths, whether the subject responded accurately or whether the morph passed through an 
outcome (all coefficients of determination R2 averaged across all subjects < 0.02). (D and E

right panel all p > 0.18 for control periodicities). (B) Within- and cross-day consistency in 
vmPFC (left panel t20 = 3.41, ** p < 0.01; right panel all control p > 0.15). (C) Cross-region 
consistency between the ERH and vmPFC (left panel t21 = 2.18, * p < 0.05; right panel all 
control p > 0.46).
