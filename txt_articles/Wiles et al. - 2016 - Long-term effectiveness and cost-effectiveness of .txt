Summary
Background Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an eff
 ective treatment for people whose depression has not 
responded to antidepressants. However, the long-term outcome is unknown. In a long-term follow-up of the CoBalT 
trial, we examined the clinical and cost-eff
 ectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy as an adjunct to usual care that 
included medication over 3–5 years in primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression.
Methods CoBalT was a randomised controlled trial done across 73 general practices in three UK centres. CoBalT 
recruited patients aged 18–75 years who had adhered to antidepressants for at least 6 weeks and had substantial 
depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II] score ≥14 and met ICD-10 depression criteria ). Participants 
were randomly assigned using a computer generated code, to receive either usual care or CBT in addition to usual 
care. Patients eligible for the long-term follow-up were those who had not withdrawn by the 12 month follow-up and 
had given their consent to being re-contacted. Those willing to participate were asked to return the postal questionnaire 
to the research team. One postal reminder was sent and non-responders were contacted by telephone to complete a 
brief questionnaire. Data were also collected from general practitioner notes. Follow-up took place at a variable 
interval after randomisation (3–5 years). The primary outcome was self-report of depressive symptoms assessed by 
BDI-II score (range 0–63), analysed by intention to treat. Cost-utility analysis compared health and social care costs 
with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). This study is registered with isrctn.com, number ISRCTN38231611.
Findings Between Nov 4, 2008, and Sept 30, 2010, 469 eligible participants were randomised into the CoBalT study. Of 
these, 248 individuals completed a long-term follow-up questionnaire and provided data for the primary outcome (136 in 
the intervention group vs 112 in the usual care group). At follow-up (median 45·5 months [IQR 42·5–51·1]), the 
intervention group had a mean BDI-II score of 19·2 (SD 13·8) compared with a mean BDI-II score of 23·4 (SD 13·2) for 
the usual care group (repeated measures analysis over the 46 months: diff
 erence in means –4·7 [95% CI –6·4 to –3·0, 
p<0·001]). Follow-up was, on average, 40 months after therapy ended. The average annual cost of trial CBT per participant 
was £343 (SD 129). The incremental cost-eff
 ectiveness ratio was £5374 per QALY gain. This represented a 92% probability 
of being cost eff
 ective at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence QALY threshold of £20 000.
Interpretation CBT as an adjunct to usual care that includes antidepressants is clinically eff
 ective and cost eff
 ective 
over the long-term for individuals whose depression has not responded to pharmacotherapy. In view of this robust 
evidence of long-term eff
 ectiveness and the fact that the intervention represented good value-for-money, clinicians 
should discuss referral for CBT with all those for whom antidepressants are not eff
 ective.

Introduction
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an eff
 ective 
treatment for depression,1,2 including for those who 
have not responded to antidepressants.3 CBT teaches 
patients skills to help them better manage their mood, 
and so has the potential to result in benefi
 t that is 
sustained beyond the end of therapy. However, little 
evidence of long-term eff
 ectiveness exists. Many trials 
report outcomes at the end of therapy2 and although 
there is evidence that CBT is eff
 ective3–8 and cost 
eff
 ective9,10 in the medium term (6–12 months), many of 
these trials are small with sample sizes of fewer than 
75 participants per group.4–7 Trials of CBT in relapse 
prevention (with sample sizes of 40 followed up at 4 and 
6 years11,12 and 158 participants followed up at roughly 
6 years13) suggest that CBT might be eff
 ective in the 
long-term. A 6-year follow-up of patients with residual 
depressive symptoms (not major depression) randomly 
assigned to CBT or usual care,14 found that the diff
 erence 
in recurrence between groups persisted for 3 years.13

Data for long-term cost-eff
 ectiveness are sparse, yet the 
cost to health services and society is well recognised.15,16 
Resource use data were not collected in the long-term 
follow-ups of CBT for relapse prevention.11–13 Other 
reports about the cost-eff
 ectiveness of CBT relate to 
diff
 erent patient populations and briefer interventions.17 
In view of the chronic relapsing nature of depression, 
knowledge of long-term outcomes and cost-eff
 ectiveness 
is needed.1
Despite expansions in psychological services in the 
UK18 and elsewhere, CBT is still a limited resource, often 
reserved for those with treatment-resistant depression 
who have not responded to antidepressants. The latter 
group represent a high proportion (>50%) of those treated 
with medication in primary care.19 To inform decision 
making, evidence should be obtained to substantiate and 
quantify the potential for long-term benefi
 t in this group.
We report the long-term follow-up of the CoBalT trial. 
We aimed to examine whether CBT (in addition to usual 
care that included pharmacotherapy) was eff
 ective and 
cost eff
 ective in reducing depressive symptoms and 
improving quality of life over the long-term (3–5 years)
compared with usual care alone in primary care patients 
with treatment-resistant depression.
Methods
Study design and participants
The design of the CoBalT trial has been previously 
described.3 The CoBalT trial was a multicentre randomised 
controlled trial done across 73 general practices in three 
UK centres.3,10,20  CoBalT recruited patients aged 18–75 years 
who had adhered to antidepressants for at least 6 weeks 
and 
had 
substantial 
depressive 
symptoms 
(Beck 
Depression Inventory21 [BDI-II] score ≥14 and met the 
ICD-10 depression criteria).3 This defi
 nition of treatment-
resistant depression was inclusive and directly relevant to 
primary care. 
Participants were randomly assigned to continue with 
usual care from their general practitioner, or to receive 
12–18 sessions of CBT in addition to usual care.
Randomisation was by means of a computer-generated 
code from a remote automated telephone randomisation 
service. Allocation was stratifi
 ed by centre and minimised 
according to four factors (baseline BDI-II score, whether 
the general practice had a counsellor, previous treatment 
with antidepressants, and duration of depression at 
baseline). Therapists were representative of those 
working in NHS psychology services.3 An independent 
assessor 
confi
 rmed 
that 
therapy 
was 
delivered 
competently.22 Participants and investigators were not 
masked to treatment assignment because of the nature 
of the intervention.
Patients eligible for long-term follow-up were those 
who had not withdrawn during the 12 month follow-up 
and had consented to be contacted about future research. 
Ethical approval for the follow-up study was given by the 
National Research Ethics Service Committee West 
Midlands, Edgbaston (reference number 13/WM/0149). 
Research governance approvals were obtained from the 
relevant local Research Ethics Committees and Clinical 
Commissioning Groups or Health Boards covering the 
three study sites (Bristol, Exeter, and Glasgow). The 
protocol is available online.  
Procedures
General practices excluded individuals who had died, 
and those it was inappropriate to re-contact (eg, people 
who were terminally ill) from the list of potential 
participants. Participants were mailed an invitation letter, 
information leafl
 et, and questionnaire to collect data for 
the various outcomes. Those willing to participate were 
asked to return the completed questionnaire to the 
research team. One postal reminder was sent and 
non-responders contacted by telephone to complete a 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Recent systematic reviews of interventions for patients with 
treatment resistant depression have underlined the paucity of 
high quality evidence in this area. In a review focused on 
psychological interventions, there were only fi
 ve included 
studies of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; including our 
pilot study for CoBalT) and most trials were small (with sample 
sizes of less than 100 participants per group) or had outcomes 
at 8–20 weeks, or both, emphasing the lack of robust evidence 
of long-term eff
 ectiveness. Subsequent to the period covered 
by these reviews, we published the fi
 ndings from the 
multicentre CoBalT trial, which had a sample size of 
469 participants. We found that CBT when given as an adjunct 
to usual care that included antidepressants was a clinically and 
cost-eff
 ective treatment for primary care patients whose 
depression had not responded to treatment with medication. 
However, the follow-up for CoBalT was limited to 12 months 
and hence no evidence exists with regards to long-term 
outcomes. In view of the chronic relapsing nature of depression, 
it is important to substantiate and quantify the potential for 
long-term gain.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study has provided the fi
 rst evidence of 
the long-term eff
 ectiveness (3-5 years) and cost-eff
 ectiveness 
of CBT as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for primary care 
patients with treatment-resistant depression.
Implications of all the available evidence
In view of this robust evidence of long-term eff
 ectiveness and 
the fact that the intervention represented good value for 
money, clinicians should discuss referral for CBT with all those 
for whom antidepressants are not eff
 ective.

brief questionnaire, which included the Patient Health 
Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), questions about use of, and 
adherence to, antidepressants, and questions about use 
of health-care services. Follow-up took place at a variable 
interval after randomisation (3–5 years). Individuals who 
had moved were traced through the Health and Social 
Care Information Centre. Consent for tracing was 
obtained previously.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was self-report of depressive 
symptoms assessed by BDI-II score21 (range 0–63). 
 
Secondary outcomes were response (≥50% reduction in 
depressive symptoms relative to baseline); remission 
(BDI-II score <10); quality of life (Short-Form health survey 
12 [SF-12]);23 and measures of depression (PHQ-9)24 and 
anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment 7 
[GAD-7])25 used in psychological services. Data for the use 
of, and adherence to, antidepressants were collected and 
current comorbidities were ascertained. Data for health 
care used in primary and secondary care and 
complementary and alternative therapy were collected for 
the economic evaluation. Participants also completed the 
EQ-5D-5L (a standardised generic measure of health status 
used as part of the economic evaluation).26 In a random 
sample of 50 participants from Bristol practices, data for 
primary care consultations and antidepressant medication 
since the 12 month follow-up were obtained to inform the 
economic evaluation.
Statistical analysis
A predefi
 ned analysis plan was agreed with the Trial 
Steering Committee. The primary outcome for the main 
trial was a binary response variable; for this follow-up, the 
primary outcome was specifi
 ed as a continuous outcome 
(BDI-II score) to maximise power. The change in the 
specifi
 cation of the primary outcome for the long-term 
follow-up was made at the time the request for additional 
funding was submitted to the funder (Nov 6, 2012).
Repeated measures analyses compared the groups as 
randomised by intention to treat, incorporating outcomes 
at 6 months, 12 months, and 3–5 years, adjusting for the 
original stratifi
 cation and minimisation variables (study 
centre, baseline BDI-II score, whether the practice had a 
counsellor, previous treatment with antidepressants, and 
duration of their depressive episode at baseline) and 
baseline measurement of the outcome. These analyses 
used an extension to generalised estimating equations 
(Stata: xtqls command) using a Markov correlation 
structure to allow for the unequal spacing of measurements 
over time.27 The summary eff
 ect measure represented the 
average diff
 erence in mean BDI-II scores between 
treatment groups over time. We formally assessed whether 
the treatment eff
 ects reported over 12 months were 
sustained or declined over the long term by introducing an 
interaction between time (in months since randomisation 
included as linear covariate) and treatment allocation in 
the model. Similar regression models were used for 
analysis of the secondary outcomes. Diff
 erences in means, 
odds ratios, 95% CIs, and p values are reported.
Sensitivity analyses examined the eff
 ect of missing data 
using the multiple imputation by chained equation 
approach,28 and linear random eff
 ect models,29 modelling 
outcome trajectories jointly with the wave-specifi
 c 
probabilities of loss to follow-up.30,31 We compared two 
alternative models for modelling loss to follow-up: 
(1) a model where loss to follow-up at each wave depended 
on the previous level of the patient’s outcome (missing at 
random); and (2) where loss to follow-up depended on 
the current value of the outcome (informative drop-out 
or missing not at random; appendix, p 4). 
The economic evaluation was done from the perspective 
of UK NHS and personal social services. We obtained 
information about patients’ health care resource use for 
the past 6 months from the questionnaire. To estimate 
resource use during the whole follow-up period, we 
combined questionnaire data with resource use data from 
the main trial at an individual level and extrapolated. 
Estimates were refi
 ned using data for consultations and 
antidepressant medication collected for 50 patients for the 
whole period from general practitioner records. Resource 
use was valued at 2013 prices, using relevant unit costs 
(appendix p 2)32–34 or infl
 ated using the hospital and 
community health services index.32 Costs and quality-
adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at 3·5%.35
EQ-5D-3L values collected during the trial were 
combined26 with EQ-5D-5L values at long-term follow-up 
to estimate QALYs for the whole period. We adjusted for 
baseline EQ-5D scores to account for the diff
 erence in

scores between groups at baseline. As the follow-up 
period varied between 3 and 5 years, average annual 
values of costs and QALYS were derived to ensure 
comparability. An incremental cost-eff
 ectiveness ratio 
was estimated and uncertainty captured with non-para-
metric bootstrapping. A cost-eff
 ectiveness acceptability 
curve was plotted to indicate the probability of the 
intervention being cost eff
 ective at diff
 erent values of 
willingness to pay. Net monetary benefi
 t statistics were 
estimated for the thresholds of £20 000 and £30 000 per 
QALY. Additional sensitivity analyses were done to test 
the robustness of our assumptions in terms of grade of 
therapist, often band 7 in Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies services instead of 8a as in the 
trial, without using general practice note data to adjust 
resource use, and imputing missing values. Statistical 
analyses were done with Stata version 13.1. This trial is 
registered with isrctn.com, number ISRCTN38231611.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had fi
 nal responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
469 participants were randomly assigned in CoBalT, 
32 withdrew from the study by 12 months, two individuals 
died, and fi
 ve did not consent to future contact.3 Thus, 
430 individuals were eligible to participate in the long-
term follow-up. Of these, a further three individuals died 
between the 12 month and 46 month follow-up (one in 
the intervention group and two in the usual care group), 
ten were excluded by their general practitioner, and 
21 could not be traced. Hence, 396 individuals were 
invited to participate between Sept 1, 2013, and April 14, 
2014, in which time 275 individuals had completed a 
questionnaire. 27 individuals declined to participate and 
94 did not respond. Long-term follow-up data were 
available for 59% of the original 469 partici 
pants randomly 
assigned. The median time from rando 
misation to long-
term 
follow-up 
questionnaire 
completion 
was 
45·5 months (IQR 42·5–51·1), which was, on average, 
39·7 months (SD 5·2) after the end of therapy for those 
who had had at least 12 sessions of CBT (n=105). 149 
(64%) participants were followed up in the intervention 
group compared with 126 (54%) in the usual care group 
(fi
 gure 1). Of these, 136 participants in the intervention 
group and 112 participants in the usual care group 
completed the BDI-II questionnaire and 148 participants 
in the intervention group and 126 participants in the 
usual care group completed the PHQ-9 questionnaire.
At trial entry, most participants had severe (mean 
baseline BDI-II score 30·9 [SD 9·8]) and chronic 
depression (duration ≥2 years, n=162 [59%]).3 66 parti-
cipants (24%) met ICD-10 criteria for severe depression.3 
Physical and psychological comorbidity were common.3 
205 (75%) had a secondary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. 
At the long-term follow-up, 199 (80%) participants reported 
at least one long-term health condition (of 249 participants 
who completed the full-length questionnaire). 115 reported 
musculoskeletal problems, 53 reported high blood 
pressure, 48 reported asthma or chest problems, and 
34 reported diabetes.
Participants in the intervention group had a BDI-II 
score that was, on average, 3·6 points lower (less 
depressed, 95% CI –6·6 to –0·6) at 46 months than those

in the usual care group (table 1). In repeated measures 
analyses, using data from 6, 12, and 46 months (fi
 gure 2, 
appendix, p 3), individuals in the intervention group had 
a mean BDI-II score that was, on average, 4·7 points 
lower (–6·4 to –3·0) over the 46 months compared with 
those in the usual care group (table 1). This equated to an 
eff
 ect size of 0·45 using the baseline SD for BDI-II 
(pooled). Mean BDI-II scores at 46 months for the usual 
care group were similar to scores at 6 and 12 months 
(fi
 gure 2, appendix, p 3).3 Although the intervention 
eff
 ect decreased slightly across the timepoints, there was 
no statistical evidence of an interaction between 
treatment allocation and time (p=0·29).
A benefi
 cial eff
 ect of the intervention was found for all 
secondary outcomes except the SF-12 physical health 
subscale (table 1). Individuals in the intervention group 
had nearly a three-fold increased odds of response over 
the 46 months compared with those in the usual care 
group. Those in the intervention group were also more 
likely to experience remission (BDI-II score <10), 
a reduction in anxiety (GAD-7), and greater improvement 
on the SF-12 mental health subscale over the 46 months 
compared with those in the usual care group (table 1). 
There was no statistical evidence that the eff
 ect of the 
intervention varied over time (interactions between 
treatment allocation and time: p>0·11). Inclusion of a 
quadratic term for time made no diff
 erence to the 
fi
 ndings. The results of sensitivity analyses to examine 
the robustness of the fi
 ndings to varying assumptions 
about missing data identifi
 ed either slightly smaller or 
larger eff
 ects, albeit consistent with the results using all 
available data (appendix, p 5).
197 (72%) participants reported taking antidepressants 
for the time since the 12 month follow-up, but sustained 
use of antidepressants was lower in the intervention 
group than in the usual care group (101 [68%] in the 
intervention group vs 96 [76%] in the usual care group). 
The intervention group were less likely to be taking 
antidepressants at 46 months (120 in the intervention 
group [81%] vs 107 [85%] in the usual care group; 
diff
 erence –4·4% [95% CI –13·3 to 4·5]), but the 
percentage who adhered to their medication was slightly 
higher in the intervention group (111 [93%] of 120) 
compared with the usual care group (96 [90%] of 107); 
diff
 erence 2·8% [–4·7 to 10·2]). However, the 95% 
surrounding these diff
 erences included the null. Only 
fi
 ve participants had used a computerised or internet-
based CBT package since the 12 month follow-up 
(appendix, p 9). 34 (27%) participants in the usual care 
group and 31 (21%) in the intervention group had 
received counselling or talking therapy since the 
12 month follow-up (appendix, p 9). However, only 
17 individuals had received cognitive therapy, and only 
fi
 ve had received 12 sessions.
The economic evaluation using complete-case data 
included 116 (50%) of 234 participants in the intervention 
group and 98 (42%) of 235 participants in the usual care 
group. Average annual NHS and personal social service 
resource use was similar between the two groups 
(appendix, p 10), emulating the 1 year follow-up result.10 
The results from the base case cost-utility analysis are 
presented in table 2. The mean annual cost per 
participant of the intervention was £343. NHS and 
personal social service costs were slightly higher in the 
usual care group (£604 vs £542), resulting in an annual 
incremental cost of £281 (95% CI £32–£531). Mean 
annualised QALYs were higher in the intervention group 
(0·596 vs 0·544), representing better health-related 
quality of life over the whole period. The incremental 
cost-eff
 ectiveness ratio was £5374. At a societal 
willingness to pay of £20 000 per QALY, the net monetary 
benefi
 t per patient per year was £782, with a probability 
of 0·92 of being cost eff
 ective (fi
 gure 3). Results remained 
robust throughout sensitivity analyses (appendix, p 11). If 
therapists were employed at grade 7, the incremental

Discussion
CBT as an adjunct to usual care was an eff
 ective 
treatment for primary care patients with treatment-
resistant depression over the long-term, and represented 
good value for money. The intervention reduced 
depressive symptoms and improved quality of life over 
an average of 46 months. This was, on average, 
40 months after the end of therapy. A long-term benefi
 t 
was also seen in terms of remission of symptoms. In 
view of the fact that, at baseline, most CoBalT 
participants had severe and chronic depression, with 
physical or psychological comorbidity, or both, these 
results are noteworthy and have clear implications for 
clinical practice.
To our knowledge, this study is the fi
 rst to show long-
term eff
 ectiveness of CBT as an adjunct to pharma 
co-
therapy for primary care patients with treat 
ment-resistant 
depression. Previous systematic reviews36,37 underlined the 
absence of high quality evidence in this area. Earlier trials 
were small (with sample sizes of less than 100 participants 
per group) with only short-term outcomes (8–20 weeks).36 
Previous fi
 ndings from the CoBalT trial were the fi
 rst 
evidence of sustained eff
 ectiveness at 12 months.3 Other 
studies reporting outcomes 6–12 months after the end of 
CBT are small (with sample sizes of less than 
75 participants per group),4–7 with one exception,8 and 
long-term outcome data (4–6 years) relate to CBT for 
relapse prevention.11–13 Other psychological therapies 
might be as eff
 ective as CBT in the short-to-medium 
term,38 but no evidence of long-term eff
 ectiveness exists.
The health-care costs of individuals with treatment-
resistant depression are larger than for many other 
groups.39,40 However, we previously showed that CBT was 
a cost-eff
 ective treatment for patients with treatment-
resistant depression over a 12 month period.10 Present 
fi
 ndings represent the fi
 rst evidence of long-term cost-
eff
 ectiveness. The cost diff
 erence between groups was 
driven by the initial cost of therapy, as health-care costs 
were very similar for the duration and no top-up sessions 
were off
 ered. The benefi
 t, in terms of health-related 
quality of life, was sustained over time, and therefore 
achieved at no additional cost. This fi
 nding reinforces our 
conclusion at 12 months that investing in CBT services 
for these patients represents an effi
  cient use of health-
care resources. Although lost productivity was not 
investigated in the long-term follow-up and a diff
 erence 
between groups was not evident at 12 months,10 the 
sustained eff
 ect might aff
 ect paid and non-paid activities 
as well as wider societal benefi
 ts, such as the wellbeing of 
families.
Our study had several strengths and limitations. The 
sample size of this study was large and it was set in UK 
primary care. Although participants in the intervention 
group were more likely to be followed up at 46 months, 
in sensitivity analyses, no evidence existed that missing 
data had biased the fi
 ndings for either the clinical or the 
cost-eff
 ectiveness analyses. In terms of costs, for the 
various sensitivity analyses, the estimated incremental 
cost-eff
 ectiveness ratio remained well below the £20 000 
per QALY threshold used by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence. 
Limited resources meant that the long-term follow-up 
data were collected by postal questionnaire rather than 
self-completion of a questionnaire at a face-to-face 
appointment with a researcher (as at the 6 and 12 month 
follow-ups). This diff
 erence probably aff
 ected the 
response rate achieved, although as stated above, there 
was no evidence of bias because of missing data. 
Importantly, collection of the same outcome measures 
as the original trial enabled comparison of data in the 
long-term. Only a small number of patients received 
CBT after the end of the trial (12 months); therefore, 
contamination did not aff
 ect the fi
 ndings. The proportion 
taking long-term anti 
depressants was also similar 
between groups. We aimed to reduce patient reporting 
bias by validating self-report data with patient notes, 
which resulted in slightly higher estimates of NHS and 
personal social services costs, implying patients had 
under-reported their health-care use. However, the 
diff
 erence was small, as shown by sensitivity analyses, 
and there was no apparent diff
 erence between the two 
groups, allowing us to be confi
 dent in our estimations of 
resource use for the whole period.
More than 50% of primary care patients with 
depression do not respond to antidepressants.19 Our 
fi
 ndings provide robust evidence for the eff
 ectiveness of 
CBT given as an adjunct to usual care that includes

medication in reducing depressive symptoms and 
improving quality of life over the long term. The eff
 ects 
observed were substantial and represented good value 
for money. As most of the CoBalT participants had severe 
and chronic depression, with physical or psychological 
comorbidity, or both, these results should off
 er hope for 
this population of diffi
  cult-to-treat patients. Clinicians 
need to discuss referral for CBT with all those for whom 
antidepressants are not eff
 ective.
Inequity in provision of mental and physical health 
care has been recognised internationally. From January, 
2014, the Aff
 ordable Care Act mandated coverage for 
mental health care in all US insurance plans, and 
waiting time targets for mental health services were 
introduced in England in April, 2015. Initiatives to 
improve provision of psychological treatments have 
mainly focused on increasing low-intensity interventions 
such as computerised CBT packages and guided self-
help for which there is little evidence of long-term 
eff
 ectiveness. Recent fi
 gures from Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies services41 in England show that 
most patients receive substantially less than the 
12–18 sessions of high-intensity CBT delivered in CoBalT 
and, in similar services elsewhere, the number of CBT 
sessions is restricted. Translation of these fi
 ndings into 
patient benefi
 t will need increased investment and 
innovation. CBT has been shown to be of benefi
 t in 
many diff
 erent health-care systems, and can be delivered 
online in real-time.8 The challenge that remains is how 
best to use technology to increase effi
  ciency in the 
delivery of CBT while maintaining these long-term 
benefi
 ts. Only by doing so will we be able to improve 
outcomes for a condition that leads to substantial 
disability in developed countries.
