Abstract
Objectives—To examine disparities in chronic conditions and health indicators among lesbian, 
gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults aged 50 years or older in the United States.
Methods—We used data from the 2013 and 2014 National Health Interview Survey to compare 
disparities in chronic conditions, health outcomes and behaviors, health care access, and 
preventive health care by sexual orientation and gender.
Results—LGB older adults were significantly more likely than heterosexual older adults to have 
a weakened immune system and low back or neck pain. In addition, sexual minority older women 
were more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to report having arthritis, asthma, a heart 
attack, a stroke, a higher number of chronic conditions, and poor general health. Sexual minority 
older men were more likely to report having angina pectoris or cancer. Rates of disability and 
mental distress were higher among LGB older adults.
Conclusions—At substantial cost to society, many disparities in chronic conditions, disability, 
and mental distress observed in younger LGB adults persist, whereas others, such as 
cardiovascular disease risks, present in later life. Interventions are needed to maximize LGB 
health.
Awareness of the health disadvantages faced by sexual minority adults has increased 
substantially in recent years. In Healthy People 2020,1 lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) 
adults were named for the first time in national health objectives, and the National Institutes 
of Health recently identified sexual minorities as health-disparate populations.2
However, insufficient population-based research data have been gathered on the health of 
sexual minorities.3 Moreover, despite the rapid growth of the older segment of the sexual

 minority population and the likelihood of health care needs increasing with age,4 research 
investigating health disparities among sexual minority older adults is particularly limited. 
Until recently, no national-level data were available to assess the health of sexual minority 
older adults. As a result, many questions remain regarding the health of this group, 
particularly whether health disparities observed in the general sexual minority adult 
population persist or diminish at older ages.
Health disparities among sexual minorities have been documented in the general population 
aged 18 years and older. There is evidence based on national data that LGB adults have 
elevated rates of some chronic health conditions relative to heterosexual adults, including 
cancer, arthritis, hepatitis, and lung disease.5 In comparison with heterosexual adults, poorer 
self-rated general physical and mental health, higher rates of disability, and greater degrees 
of functional limitation have been reported among LGB adults in multiple US population-
based studies,6,7 including the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which has 
included a sexual orientation question since 2013.8 Differences in health behaviors have 
been documented as well, including elevated rates of excessive drinking (particularly among 
sexual minority women)6 and smoking.8 Moreover, lesbians and bisexual women have been 
found to face elevated barriers to accessing health care, including lack of insurance and 
financial barriers.8
Population-based data specific to sexual minority older adults are much more limited, and no 
studies to our knowledge have analyzed national-level disparities in this specific population. 
Although existing state-level data have consistently revealed heightened risks of poor mental 
health, poor general health, and disability among LGB older adults,9,10 findings are mixed 
regarding disparities in rates and severity of chronic health conditions, which are of 
particular concern in the LGB older adult population as a result of their potential to 
dramatically affect quality of life, functional disability, mortality, and health care costs.11
In one study involving state-level population-based data from adults aged 50 years or older 
in Washington State, rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity were higher among lesbians 
than among heterosexual women; however, rates of chronic conditions were not elevated 
among gay or bisexual men after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics.9 In 
contrast, in an investigation of adults aged 50 to 70 years old in California, there were no 
differences by sexual orientation in rates of cardiovascular disease or other chronic 
conditions among women, but gay and bisexual men showed elevated rates of diabetes and 
hypertension relative to heterosexual men.10 Using NHIS data, Gonzales and Henning-
Smith12 found that older men and women in same-sex cohabiting partnerships were less 
likely than those in opposite-sex partnerships to report having a chronic condition.
Taken together, these sparse and divergent findings highlight the need to use nationally 
representative data to more fully investigate disparities in chronic conditions and other key 
health indicators among sexual minority older women (lesbians and bisexual women) and 
men (gay and bisexual men). The study described here, based on national data, is to our 
knowledge the first to examine the extent to which sexual orientation and gender are related 
to disparities in chronic health conditions, general health outcomes, health behaviors, health 
care access, and preventive health care specifically among adults aged 50 years or older in

 the United States. Our aim was to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the aging 
needs of the increasingly diverse older adult population.
METHODS
We derived our aggregated population-based data from the 2013 and 2014 versions of the 
NHIS, the largest in-person household health survey of the US noninstitutionalized 
population; we analyzed data from the sub-sample of adults aged 50 years or older.9 In 2013, 
for the first time, the survey assessed sexual orientation. Survey respondents were asked 
“Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?” Response categories 
were as follows: gay or lesbian, straight (not gay or lesbian), bisexual, something else, and 
don’t know. We included in our study participants who self-identified as gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, or straight. Our sample comprised 18 669 heterosexual women, 14 141 
heterosexual men, 197 lesbians, 229 gay men, 55 bisexual women, and 55 bisexual men. We 
applied pooled weights throughout our analyses to adjust for the unequal probabilities of 
sample selection arising from the study design and nonresponse.
Measures
Chronic health conditions—Participants were asked whether they had ever been told by 
a doctor or other health professional that they had had a stroke, a heart attack, angina 
pectoris, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, arthritis, low 
back or neck pain, diabetes, cancer, and weakened immune system. Obesity was defined as a 
body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter squared or greater.13 We computed numbers of 
chronic conditions14 by summing the conditions (other than weakened immune system, 
which was included only in 2013) reported by each participant.
General health outcomes—The NHIS assessed participants’ general health via self-
evaluations.15 We dichotomized general health categories into good (good, very good, or 
excellent) and poor (fair or poor). Disability was measured through participants’ affirmative 
responses to any of the following items:
1.
trouble with seeing, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses;
2.
activity limitations attributable to hearing problems;
3.
difficulty in walking up 10 steps without resting or walking a quarter of a mile 
without using any special equipment;
4.
needing help with bathing or showering;
5.
needing help in handling routine needs; or
6.
being limited in any way because of difficulty remembering or experiencing 
periods of confusion.16
Limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) were 
assessed by asking whether participants, because of a physical, mental, or emotional 
problem, needed help with personal care (e.g., eating, bathing, dressing) and routine needs 
(e.g., everyday household chores, shopping, doing necessary business), respectively.15

 Mental distress was measured via the 6-item Psychological Distress Scale (α = 0.87); a 
summed score greater than 6 was coded as reflecting mental distress.17
Health behaviors, health care access, and preventive health care—Among those 
who had smoked 100 or more cigarettes, current and former smokers were distinguished by 
whether or not they currently smoked.15 Excessive drinking was defined as women having 4 
or more and men having 5 or more drinks on a single occasion during the preceding 
month.18 Former drinkers were categorized as those who had consumed at least 12 drinks 
during their lifetime but no drinks in the preceding year.19 Physical activity was defined 
according to a combined duration of moderate and vigorous activities of 150 minutes or 
more per week as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.20 Those 
who reported experiencing any of 4 types of sleep problems (trouble falling asleep, trouble 
staying asleep, taking sleep aid medication, and not waking up feeling well rested in the past 
week) 3 times or more a week21 were categorized as having sleep problems.
We assessed health care access according to whether participants had health insurance 
coverage and a primary source of care (a place to go when they were sick or needed advice 
about health). Preventive health care was assessed according to whether participants had had 
a blood pressure screening, flu shot, or mammogram (among women aged 50–70 years) in 
the preceding 12 months and whether they had ever had an HIV test.
Sociodemographic characteristics—The sociodemographic characteristics assessed 
included age in years, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White vs other), household income 
(200% or below vs more than 200% above the federal poverty level), employment status 
(employed vs not employed), educational attainment (high school or less vs at least some 
college), relationship status, and living arrangement (living alone vs living with someone). 
Relationship status was categorized as married, partnered (living with a partner), or single 
(widowed, divorced, separated, or never married).
Statistical Analysis
We used Stata version 14.0 in conducting our analyses.22 All analyses were conducted 
separately by gender. Sexual orientation was dichotomized into sexual minority (lesbian, 
gay, bisexual) or heterosexual, with heterosexuals treated as the reference group.
First, we used the adjusted Wald test to compare estimates of sociodemographic 
characteristics according to sexual orientation. Second, we estimated prevalence rates for 
health indicators by sexual orientation. We conducted a series of logistic and linear 
regressions as appropriate, controlling for socioeconomic covariates (age, race/ethnicity, 
income, and education) that have been found to be associated with health disparities,23,24 to 
test associations between sexual orientation and chronic health conditions and other health 
indicators. Also, we assessed the statistical significance of differences in sociodemographic 
characteristics and key health indicators between sexual minority subgroups (lesbians vs 
bisexual women and gay men vs bisexual men).
We applied balanced repeated replications methodology to calculate standard errors.25 This 
method incorporates the specific complex sampling designs of the NHIS, with each

 sampling stratum having exactly 2 sampling units. We used the Survey package in R26 to 
derive a 308 × 308 Hadamard matrix and used the first 300 entries in computing balanced 
repeated replication weights.
RESULTS
In comparison with heterosexual older women, sexual minority older women were younger 
and had higher household incomes, educational attainment levels, and employment rates, 
whereas the racial/ethnic backgrounds of the 2 groups were comparable (Table 1). Sexual 
minority older women were less likely than heterosexual older women to be married, more 
likely to be partnered, and equally likely to be single. There were no significant differences 
in number of children in the household or likelihood of living alone. Subgroup comparisons 
revealed that bisexual women had lower incomes than lesbians, were more likely to be 
married, and were less likely to be partnered.
In comparison with heterosexual older men, sexual minority older men were significantly 
younger and had higher educational levels; however, there were no differences in income or 
employment status. Sexual minority older men were more likely than heterosexual older 
men to be non-Hispanic White, less likely to be married, more likely to be partnered, and 
more likely to be single. In addition, they were more likely to live alone and had fewer 
children in the household. According to subgroup comparisons, bisexual older men were 
older and less likely to be employed than gay older men; although members of the 2 groups 
were equally likely to be married, bisexual older men were less likely to be partnered, and 
they had more children in the household.
Chronic Health Conditions
Table 2 presents data on the prevalence of chronic health conditions according to sexual 
orientation and gender and the results of significance tests after control for demographic 
characteristics. Sexual minority older women were more likely than heterosexual older 
women to have experienced a stroke, a heart attack, asthma, arthritis, low back or neck pain, 
and a weakened immune system but were less likely to have diabetes. Sexual minority older 
women had a significantly higher number of chronic conditions than heterosexual older 
women. Among sexual minority older women, lesbians were more likely than bisexual 
women to report having had a stroke (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.79; P < .05), a heart 
attack (adjusted OR = 4.47; P < .01), or arthritis (adjusted OR = 3.15; P < .001).
Sexual minority older men were more likely than heterosexual older men to report angina 
pectoris, low back or neck pain, cancer, and a weakened immune system; they were less 
likely to be obese. The likelihood of a weakened immune system (adjusted OR = 10.25; P 
< .001) and obesity (adjusted OR = 2.77; P < .001) was higher among gay older men than 
among bisexual older men, whereas bisexual older men were more likely to have low back 
or neck pain (adjusted OR = 1.57; P < .05).
General Health Outcomes
As shown in Table 3, after adjustment for demographic characteristics, sexual minority older 
women were more likely than heterosexual older women to report poor general health,

 disability, and mental distress; they were less likely to report ADL limitations. Among 
sexual minority older women, lesbians were more likely than bisexual women to report poor 
general health (adjusted OR = 2.22; P < .001) and disability (adjusted OR = 2.66; P < .001), 
whereas bisexual women were more likely to report ADL limitations (adjusted OR = 0.08; P 
< .01).
Sexual minority older men were more likely than heterosexual older men to report disability, 
ADL and IADL limitations, and mental distress. Among sexual minority older men, gay 
men were more likely than bisexual men to report ADL limitations (adjusted OR = 4.40; P 
< .01), and bisexual men were more likely to report mental distress (adjusted OR = 1.93; P 
< .05).
Health Behaviors
Table 4 shows that, after control for demographic characteristics, sexual minority older 
women were more likely to engage in excessive drinking than heterosexual older women and 
were more likely to be former drinkers and smokers. Also, sexual minority older women 
were more likely than heterosexual older women to experience sleep problems. Rates of 
physical activity did not differ according to sexual orientation. Subgroup comparisons 
showed that lesbians were more likely than bisexual women to be former drinkers (adjusted 
OR = 2.66; P < .001).
In comparison with heterosexual older men, sexual minority older men were more likely to 
be current smokers and to engage in excessive drinking. Physical activity and sleep problems 
were not associated with sexual orientation among older men. Subgroup comparisons 
revealed that bisexual men were more likely than gay men to be current smokers (adjusted 
OR = 2.13; P < .01).
Health Care Access and Preventive Health Care
After adjustment for demographic characteristics, sexual minority older women were more 
likely than heterosexual older women to have insurance coverage; there were no significant 
differences in having a usual source of care (Table 4). In terms of preventive care, adjusted 
analyses showed that sexual minority older women were more likely to have had a blood 
pressure screening and HIV test than were heterosexual older women.
Older men were comparable with respect to health care access across sexual orientation 
groups. Sexual minority older men were more likely than heterosexual older men to have 
had a flu shot and an HIV test during the preceding year. Subgroup comparisons showed that 
gay men were more likely than bisexual men to have had an HIV test (adjusted OR = 1.70; P 
< .05).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first national population-based study to comprehensively 
investigate disparities in chronic health conditions and other key health indicators among 
sexual minority older adults. In comparison with heterosexual older adults, sexual minority 
older adults exhibited a significantly higher likelihood of chronic health conditions and other

 disparities; however, they also showed some positive health indicators. As the population 
ages, the prevalence of chronic conditions increases,27 and these conditions represent some 
of the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems.11 It is critical that 
groups at elevated risk for chronic health conditions be identified and targeted for prevention 
efforts, both to improve their health and well-being and to control health care expenditures.
Sexual minority older adults in this study were more likely than heterosexual older adults to 
experience low back or neck pain and weakened immune systems, which have not been 
examined in previous studies. These disparities, along with consistent findings of elevated 
distress and disability among sexual minority older adults7,8 and poor general health among 
sexual minority older women, particularly lesbians,8 likely reflect the substantial toll of 
marginalization and stigma across the life course.4,28 Chronic stressors can affect physical 
health over the life span through an accumulation of allostatic load, causing acceleration of 
aging.29 In studies of sexual and gender minority older adults, discrimination and 
victimization have been shown to be the strongest predictors of poor health outcomes.30,31
Some of the disparities found with chronic health conditions may develop earlier in 
adulthood and persist into older age. Gonzales et al. observed this pattern for the higher 
likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions among lesbians and bisexual women aged 
18 years or older.8 In addition, previous studies have consistently shown heightened risks of 
asthma6 and arthritis5 among sexual minority women and cancer among sexual minority 
men.5,32 Other disparities documented in this study, including disparities in cardiovascular 
disease risks such as stroke and heart attack among sexual minority older women and angina 
pectoris among men, seem to first emerge in older adulthood. Interestingly, disparities in 
obesity, although well documented,33 were not significantly different by sexual orientation 
among women in this study. This finding could reflect a leveling effect, with rates of obesity 
among older heterosexual women reaching a level comparable to rates among sexual 
minority women; it could also reflect selection bias resulting from premature mortality 
among those who are obese in younger adulthood.
We found higher likelihoods of ADL and IADL limitations among gay and bisexual older 
men, which have not been previously documented in other studies of younger LGB adults.8 
Such limitations may be associated with higher rates of disabling chronic conditions, such as 
cancer and angina pectoris, and likely require additional access to formal and informal care-
giving. Yet, we found that sexual minority older men were more likely to live alone and less 
likely to have children in the household, which may result in an increased risk of social 
isolation in old age. Although sexual minority men had higher levels of education, this 
advantage did not lead to concomitant gains in resources such as income or employment.
Sexual minority older women exhibited lower rates of diabetes and a lower risk of ADL 
limitations despite heightened risks in some chronic conditions, poor general health, and 
disability. It will be important in future research to examine how some protective factors, 
such as physical activity and socioeconomic resources, among sexual minority older women 
might help delay the progression to certain chronic diseases and limitations in independent 
living. Sexual minority older women had higher incomes, educational levels, and 
employment rates than heterosexual older women despite heightened risks in several health

 indicators. They were also more likely to have health insurance coverage, whereas NHIS 
data for adults aged 18 years or older indicate that sexual minority women are more likely 
than heterosexual women to lack health insurance coverage.8 It may be that sexual minority 
older women were aware at a younger age that they had to support themselves and were 
more likely to seek education and employment despite the traditional roles for women at the 
time. Recent policy changes may also help them secure health insurance.
The recognition of sexual minority families in the Affordable Care Act (Pub Law No. 
111-148) as well as the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Windsor v. United States (570 US 
___, 2013) may have made it easier for working sexual minority individuals and those who 
were married to obtain health insurance.
With respect to health behaviors, our data revealed more sleep problems among sexual 
minority older women than heterosexual women, a potentially understudied health issue in 
this population. Sexual minority men, as in previous studies, were more likely to report 
smoking.8 However, we also found signs of resilience among sexual minority older adults. 
Sexual minority older women were more likely to report being former drinkers and smokers, 
suggesting that many of these women take action to reduce such adverse health behaviors 
and promote their own health as they age. In addition, as a positive sign that LGB older 
adults are accessing preventive care, sexual minority older adults fared better than 
heterosexual older adults in terms of HIV testing, blood pressure screening (among women), 
and flu shots (among men).
Previous studies have shown that greater levels of social support and community 
connectedness are associated with good health and optimal aging among LGB older 
adults.30 Future studies need to examine aspects of both resilience and risk as a means of 
understanding the complex health issues in these populations.
Although studies involving larger samples of bisexual older adults are needed, our findings 
reveal important differences among sexual minority subgroups that need to be considered in 
prevention, intervention development, and research. Bisexual people may experience 
elevated stress and social isolation, in part as a result of marginalization within lesbian and 
gay communities as well as society in general. This disadvantaged status may have 
contributed to our findings that bisexual older men were at elevated risk for low back or neck 
pain, mental distress, and smoking and that bisexual older women were at greater risk for 
poverty.
Limitations
Although the results of our study have important implications for public health research and 
practice, there are a few limitations. Our findings are based on self-reported data; 
incorporating objective measures would likely reduce errors in estimates. The sampling 
weights may not have adequately adjusted for sampling bias because of the possibility of 
higher nonresponse rates on sexual orientation questions among those in older age brackets 
and racial/ethnic minority groups.34,35 The samples of sexual minority older adults in this 
study were not large enough to allow investigation of health disparity differences among 
such subgroups. Because the NHIS collects information annually, pooled multiple-year data

 will allow for further evaluation of the diverse experiences of sexual minority older adults 
and for the development of targeted prevention efforts and interventions to improve the 
health of this population. Although the inclusion of a sexual orientation item in the NHIS is 
an important step forward, data regarding gender identity and expression are still lacking.
Conclusions
This study is a significant step forward in understanding health disparities among sexual 
minority older adults. Our findings present a complex picture of sexual minority older adult 
health and suggest both that health disparities persist into older adulthood and that new 
health concerns emerge with the aging of the sexual minority population. Targeted 
prevention and intervention programs are needed to identify sexual minority older adults at 
greatest health risk and to promote good health in later life.
