 loss (supplementary materials). However, the
prominent mountains at the western margin of
SP, and the strange, multikilometer-high mound
features to the south are both young geologically
and presumably composed of relatively strong,
water-ice–based geological materials. Their origin,
and what drove their formation so late in solar
system history, remain uncertain. What is more
certain is that all three major Kuiper belt bodies
(past or present) visited by spacecraft so far—Pluto,
Charon, and Triton—are more different than sim-
ilar and bear witness to the potential diversity
awaiting the future exploration of their realm.

FEEDING BEHAVIOR
The nutrient sensor OGT in PVN
neurons regulates feeding
Olof Lagerlöf,1,2 Julia E. Slocomb,3 Ingie Hong,1 Yeka Aponte,1,4 Seth Blackshaw,1

Maintaining energy homeostasis is crucial for the survival and health of organisms.
The brain regulates feeding by responding to dietary factors and metabolic signals from
peripheral organs. It is unclear how the brain interprets these signals. O-GlcNAc
transferase (OGT) catalyzes the posttranslational modification of proteins by O-GlcNAc
and is regulated by nutrient access. Here, we show that acute deletion of OGT from
aCaMKII-positive neurons in adult mice caused obesity from overeating. The hyperphagia
derived from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, where loss
of OGT was associated with impaired satiety. These results identify O-GlcNAcylation in
aCaMKII neurons of the PVN as an important molecular mechanism that regulates
feeding behavior.
O
besity is a major contributor to disease
throughout the world (1). Currently, there
is no successful and available treatment
for the majority of obese patients. One
of the genes most commonly linked to
human obesity, Gnpda2, affects flux through
the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP)
(2–4). The HBP produces uridine-diphosphate:
N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is
the donor substrate for the enzyme O-GlcNAc
transferase (OGT). OGT cleaves UDP-GlcNAc and
covalently attaches GlcNAc to the hydroxyl group
of serine or threonine in nuclear and cytoplasmic
proteins in b-linkage (O-GlcNAc). Nutrient access
directly via the HBP, and metabolic hormones
such as insulin regulate the activity of OGT (5, 6).
Although OGT has been shown to be important
for neuronal development, the role of OGT for ma-
ture brain function is almost completely unknown
(7–9). To study the function of OGT in normal
behavior, we created conditional OGT knockout
mice by crossing floxed OGT mice (OGTFl) with
mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible version of
Cre recombinase under the aCaMKII promoter
(aCaMKII-CreERT2). This enables acute brain-
specific deletion of OGT in aCaMKII-expressing
neurons in adult mice, which we confirmed by
meansofimmunohistochemistry,Westernblotting,
and polymerase chain reaction (fig. S1). Knock-
out of OGT in other tissues and cells has been
shown to lead to decreases in cell number,
probably because of impaired mitosis, and in fact,
constitutive knockout of OGT leads to early em-
bryonic lethality (8, 10, 11). In contrast, in post-
mitotic neurons deletion of OGT did not affect
cell number in vitro or in vivo (fig. S2, A and B).
Acute and brain-specific loss of OGT in adult
mice caused rapid weight gain (Fig. 1, A and B,
and fig. S3, A and B). Within 3 weeks, the amount
of adipose tissue tripled, whereas the lean weight
had not changed, as quantified with whole-body
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [fat mass,
n = 7 wild-type (WT) mice, 2.5 ± 0.21 g; n = 6
OGT knockout mice, 8.3 ± 0.86 g] (fig. S3, C and
D). The incorporation of fat was general and not
particular to any specific body region (fig. S3, E
to G). Obesity can result from either excessive
caloric intake or insufficient energy expenditure.
Daily food intake rapidly increased upon knock-
out of OGT and plateaued at a level more than
twice as high (Fig. 1C). If access to food was re-
stricted to the same amount consumed by WT
mice, the OGT knockout mice retained normal
body weight. When free access to food was re-
introduced, the OGT knockout mice quickly
approached the weight of OGT knockout litter-
mates who had been fed ad libitum throughout
the experiment (Fig. 1D). To quantify food intake
and energy expenditure simultaneously in real
time, we used comprehensive laboratory animal
monitoring system (CLAMS). CLAMS confirmed
that loss of OGT leads to hyperphagia (fig. S3H).
Energy expenditure was actually increased (fig.
S3I). The acceleratedenergy expenditure resulted
from, at least in part, hyperactivity (fig. S3J). As
expected from a combination of hyperphagia
and hyperactivity, knocking out OGT caused
higher vO2 and vCO2, leading to a respiratory ex-
change ratio (RER) above 1 (n = 17 WT mouse
days (6 mice), 0.94 ± 0.004; n = 20 OGT knockout
mouse days (6 mice), 1.04 ± 0.007) (fig. S3, K to M).
Daily food intake is a factor of both the size of
each meal and meal frequency. A normal diurnal
rhythm was preserved in OGT knockout mice
(Fig. 1E and fig. S4, A and B). Although there
was no difference in meal frequency, loss of OGT
increased meal size as well as meal duration
(meal size, n = 268 WT mouse meals (6 mice),

 0.25 ± 0.02 g; n = 330 OGT knockout mouse
meals (7 mice), 0.42 ± 0.02 g) (Fig. 1E and fig. S4,
C to E). The point at which a meal is terminated
depends on the total caloric content of the food
but also noncaloric determinants of the food,
mainly its volume and composition. When fed
either regular carbohydrate-rich pellets or fat-
based food paste with higher caloric density, the
OGT knockout mice overate the same amount
of calories (fig. S4F).
Immunohistochemistry for OGT showed that
within the core feeding circuitry, the major loss
of OGT in the knockout mice occurred in medial
nuclei of the hypothalamus, most notably in the
paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (Fig. 2A and fig.
S5A). There was only minor loss of OGT from
nuclei of the midbrain and the brainstem (Fig. 2A
and fig. S5A). Using aCaMKII-CreER+ × TdTFl mice
and immunohistochemistry, we noticed that some
aCaMKIIPVNcellsexpressedthyrotropin-releasing
hormone (TRH) and some oxytocin (fig. S6A). Be-
fore any major weight gain, OGT deletion reduced
the expression of TRH, as determined with in
situ hybridization, in a subpopulation of cells
in the PVN without affecting their viability,
whereas several other known neuropeptides
regulating feeding behavior were largely unal-
tered: proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine-
and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART),
orexin, agouti-related peptide (AgRP), neuropep-
tide Y (NPY), vasopressin (AVP), and oxytocin
(TRH, n = 4 WT mice, 40 ± 4.1 cells/150 × 103 mm2;
n = 4 OGT knockout mice, 23 ± 2.9 cells/150 ×
103 mm2) (Fig. 2B and figs. S6, B to E, and S7A)
(12, 13). Next, we infected hypothalamic organo-
typic cultures with a virus that expresses green
fluorescent protein (GFP) under the aCaMKII pro-
moter and treated the explants with varying con-
centrations of glucose. The PVN retained its normal
morphology and expression of neuropeptide dur-
ing the extent of the experiment (~2.5 weeks)
(fig. S8A). Immunohistochemistry for O-GlcNAc
demonstrated that 1 hour of treatment with 5 mM
glucose, simulating physiological and meal-derived
fluctuations in glucose, increased O-GlcNAc in
aCaMKII-positive cells [1 mM glucose, n = 360
cells, 134 ± 10 intensity/cell (arbitrary units, a.u.);
5 mM glucose n = 330 cells, 211 ± 12 intensity/cell
(a.u.)] (Fig. 2C) (14–16). In contrast, there was
no change in O-GlcNAc levels in neighboring
aCaMKII-negative cells (fig. S8B). Incubation for
16 hours with 25 mM glucose raised the O-GlcNAc
levels in aCaMKII cells to a larger extent [5 mM
glucose, n = 390 cells, 156 ± 9 intensity/cell (a.u.);
25 mM glucose, n = 375 cells, 298 ± 14 intensity/
cell (a.u.)] (fig. S8, C and D). Unlike cortex and the
hippocampus, where O-GlcNAc levels mirror food
intake, it has recently been reported that fasting
increased O-GlcNAc in AgRP neurons, which has
been proposed to be due to stimulation of OGT
expression by ghrelin in these cells (6, 7, 15). In
the PVN, fasting decreased O-GlcNAc, but only in
aCaMKII-positive cells [aCaMKII-positive cells,
fed mice n = 455 cells, 158 ± 5 intensity/cell (a.u.);
starved mice n = 259 cells, 81 ± 6 intensity/cell
(a.u.)] (fig. S8E). In addition, we compared the
expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos
in aCaMKII PVN cells in vivo in mice fed ad
libitum or refed upon starvation. This enabled us
to characterize cellular responses to food intake as
mice start eating after a period of starvation. Food
intake appeared to activate aCaMKII cells in the
PVN, and loss of OGT blocked this activation
completely (fig. S8, F and G).
O-GlcNAc is highly expressed in neuronal
synapses in the brain (17). We crossed aCaMKII-
CreER+ × OGTFl/WT × TdTFl mice to assess whether
OGT regulates excitatory synaptic input onto
aCaMKII PVN cells. If deleting OGT attenuates
excitatory input, it would explain, at least in part,
how OGT regulates the activity of these cells. The
mean capacitance of labeled cells averaged ~15 pF
and did not differ between WT and knockout mice
(fig. S9A). The mean miniature excitatory post-
synaptic current (mEPSC) frequency decreased
by 72% in OGT knockout cells (n = 6 WT cells,
1.75 ± 0.11 Hz; n = 6 OGT knockout cells, 0.50 ±
0.10 Hz) (Fig. 3, A and B). The sharp decrease in
mEPSC frequency suggests that OGT is essential
for maintaining the number of functional excit-
atory synapses onto aCaMKII PVN neurons.

 The mean mEPSC amplitude was also de-
creased, but to a much smaller degree (n = 6 WT
cells 19.7 ± 1.2 pA; n = 6 knockout cells, 15.6 ±
0.9 pA) (Fig. 3, A and C). Neither the rise time
nor the decay time of the EPSCs changed upon
deletion of OGT (fig. S9, B and C). Pharmaco-
logical inhibition of glutamatergic signaling in
the PVN has previously been shown to elicit in-
tense feeding (18).
Selectively deleting OGT in the aCaMKII cells
of the PVN by means of stereotactic virus injec-
tion caused concurrent obesity and hyperphagia
(Fig. 4, A to C, and fig. S9D). Because deletion of
OGT in aCaMKII cells in the PVN prevents their
feeding-induced activation and leads to hyper-
phagia, we predicted that stimulating those cells
would decrease food intake. Activating aCaMKII
PVN cells optogenetically decreased cumulative
food consumption over 24 hours (baseline, n = 11
experiments (5 mice), 3.6 ± 0.14 g; 50 Hz, n = 11
experiments (5 mice), 2.6 ± 0.33 g) (Fig. 4, D and
E) (19). The amount of food ingested per meal was
smaller, whereas there was no significant effect
on meal frequency (meal size, baseline, n = 125
meals, 0.25 ± 0.014 g; 50 Hz, n = 110 meals, 0.20 ±
0.014 g) (Fig. 4F and fig. S9E). In a second ex-
periment, we started the stimulation at the onset
of darkness after fasting the mice during the light
phase. Fasting increased food intake, and 20 Hz
optogenetic stimulation for 4 hours produced a
significant decrease in food intake, whereas 50 Hz
stimulation for 1 or 4 hours produced large, sig-
nificant drops in feeding (fig. S9F). The decrease
in meal size with 50 Hz stimulation was evident
in the first meal, without any change in latency
to initiation of feeding (fig. S9, G and H).
Together, our data favor a model in which the
function of OGT is to couple energy intake with
energy need, at least in part, by regulating the
excitatory synaptic input in aCaMKII PVN cells
(Fig. 4G). The select effect on meal termination
suggests that OGT regulates satiation. aCaMKII
neurons are often excitatory. Although vGlut2-
positive excitatory neurons in the PVN decrease
food intake, there appears to be only partial over-
lap between aCaMKII and vGlut2 expression in
the PVN (20, 21). Because glucose remains ele-
vated in the cerebrospinal fluid more than 1 hour
upon eating, the feeding-related changes in
O-GlcNAc integrates nutrient availability on a time
scale longer than a single meal (14, 22, 23). The
brain promotes satiation by coordinating adipo-
kines, reflecting body energy depots, and acute
food-derived signals into circuits that turn off
feeding. Rather than constituting a link in meal-
to-meal satiety feedback loops, our observations
suggest that OGT controls the threshold of such
loops through its regulation of excitatory synap-
tic transmission onto aCaMKII PVN neurons.
The observation that OGT knockout mice quickly
reached a plateau in daily food intake supports
this idea. Thresholding satiation between meals
confers the behavioral advantage of stabilizing
caloric intake over time so that the previous meal
informs on the caloric need of the next. These
data do not exclude additional, faster regulation
of OGT activity and levels via metabolic hormones.
These findings identify the regulation of excita-
tory synapses onto aCaMKII PVN neurons by OGT
as an important mechanism underlying satiation,
representing a potential medicinal target for hu-
man obesity.

Postnatal colonization of the body with microbes is assumed to be the main stimulus to
postnatal immune development. By transiently colonizing pregnant female mice, we show
that the maternal microbiota shapes the immune system of the offspring. Gestational
colonization increases intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cells and F4/80+CD11c+
mononuclear cells in the pups. Maternal colonization reprograms intestinal transcriptional
profiles of the offspring, including increased expression of genes encoding epithelial
antibacterial peptides and metabolism of microbial molecules. Some of these effects are
dependent on maternal antibodies that potentially retain microbial molecules and transmit
them to the offspring during pregnancy and in milk. Pups born to mothers transiently
colonized in pregnancy are better able to avoid inflammatory responses to microbial
molecules and penetration of intestinal microbes.
D
uring pregnancy, the eutherian fetus in-
habits a largely sterile environment in
utero, protected from infections by mater-
nal immunity. Rejection of the allogeneic
fetus is avoided through maternal and fe-
tal vascular separation, the immune privileged
status of the placental trophoblast, and gesta-
tional maternal tolerance mechanisms (1). At birth,
the situation changes dramatically as body sur-
facesbecome progressively colonizedwithmicrobes,
directly exposing the immature neonatal immune
system to potential pathogens (2, 3). Despite
continued protection from the immunoglobulins
and antibacterial peptides in milk, the conse-
quence of this transition for human health is that
most of the worldwide mortality in children up
to 5 years old is due to infectious disease (4–6).
Immune system development is both prepro-
grammed in neonatal tissues and driven later by
exposure to pathogenic and nonpathogenic mi-
crobes (3). Germ-free mice have low immuno-
globulin concentrations; lymphopenia of lymphoid
structures; reduced bone marrow leukocyte pools;
and aberrant innate and adaptive immune func-
tions (7, 8). It has been widely assumed that most
microbiota-driven immune alterations are post-
natal effects induced by the neonate’s own micro-
biota (2, 9, 10). Here, we challenge this assumption
by asking how the maternal microbiota in preg-
nancy alone affects the early postnatal immune
system of the offspring.
To achieve gestation-only colonization under
conditions where the mice deliver their pups spon-
taneously at term, we used a system in which
pregnant dams are transiently colonized with
genetically engineered Escherichia coli HA107
(11). Because this strain does not persist in the
intestine, pregnant dams become germ-free again
before term and naturally deliver germ-free pups
(fig. S1A). Although E. coli is a minor component
of the adult human microbiota, it is commoner
in the neonatal intestine (12) and a frequent cause
of human neonatal sepsis (13).
Gestation-only colonization shapes
the intestinal mucosal innate
immune composition
Gestation-only colonization with E. coli HA107
altered the numbers of early postnatal intestinal
innate leukocytes in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. At
postnatal day 14, there was an increase in small
intestinal innate lymphoid cell (ILC) proportions
and total numbers compared with germ-free con-
trols, particularly the NKp46+RORgt+ ILC3 sub-
set (Fig. 1, A and B, and fig. S1B). Small intestinal
NKp46+RORgt+ ILC3 are described in germ-free
mice (14), but persistently increased following
transient gestational colonization, reaching a max-
imum in 14- to 21-day-old pups: This increase
persisted even after weaning (Fig. 1C and fig. S1C),
consistent with increased small intestinal ILC3
content of colonized compared with germ-free
mice (15) and the microbiota-dependent mod-
ulation of RORgt expression in this subset (16).
Increases in the expression of the cytokine
interleukin-22 (IL-22) in this population have
been observed following permanent colonization
or the introduction of segmented filamentous
bacteria to the microbiota (17, 18). Total numbers
of IL-22–expressing cells increased in line with
the increased NKp46+RORgt+ ILC3 numbers as
a result of gestational colonization, although in-
dividual IL-22 expression levels did not change,
likely because the pups were born and raised
germ-free (fig. S1, D to F).
There was also an increase in the small and
large intestinal F4/80+CD11c+ mononuclear cells
(iMNCs) in day 14 (d14) pups born to gestation-
only colonized dams (Fig. 1, D and E, and fig. S2,
A to C), whereas the F4/80+CD11c– macrophages,
F4/80loCD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs), and the CD103+
or CD11b+ DC subpopulations were not signifi-
cantly affected (Fig. 1, D and E, and fig. S2, B to E).
The gestational effects on increased F4/80+CD11c+
iMNCs were also maximal between postnatal days
14 to 21, and they persisted until at least 8 weeks
of age in the colon (Fig. 1F). Gestational coloniza-
tion caused no significant changes insmall intestinal
ILC2 numbers (fig. S3, A and B) or in other early
postnatal innate leukocyte populations in either
systemic or intestinal tissues (table S1). These re-
sults showed that temporary colonization of a
pregnant dam has long-term consequences for
certain populations of innate lymphoid and mono-
nuclear cells in the intestines of her offspring.
We next sought to verify that the effects of
gestational E. coli on early postnatal innate leu-
kocytes would also be seen with animals stably
colonized by a different microbiota both in the
mother and after birth. We compared C57BL/6
animals carrying the defined altered Schaedler
flora (ASF) of eight microbes with germ-free con-
trols. Both small intestinal NKp46+ ILC3 and in-
testinal F4/80+CD11c+ MNC populations were
increased in pups born to stably colonized ASF
