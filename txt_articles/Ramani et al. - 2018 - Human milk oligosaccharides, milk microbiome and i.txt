Neonatal rotavirus infections are predominantly asymptomatic. While an association with
gastrointestinal symptoms has been described in some settings, factors influencing differ-
ences in clinical presentation are not well understood. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we
show that a complex interplay between human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), milk micro-
biome, and infant gut microbiome impacts neonatal rotavirus infections. Validating in vitro
studies where HMOs are not decoy receptors for neonatal strain G10P[11], population studies
show significantly higher levels of Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), 2’-fucosyllactose (2’FL), and 6’-
siallylactose (6’SL) in milk from mothers of rotavirus-positive neonates with gastrointestinal
symptoms. Further, these HMOs correlate with abundance of Enterobacter/Klebsiella in
maternal milk and infant stool. Specific HMOs also improve the infectivity of a neonatal
strain-derived rotavirus vaccine. This study provides molecular and translational insight into
host factors influencing neonatal rotavirus infections and identifies maternal components that
could promote the performance of live, attenuated rotavirus vaccines.

reast milk is an excellent source of nutrition for a newborn
infant, providing macronutrients such as lipids, fats, pro-
teins, and carbohydrates, as well as numerous micro-
nutrients essential for infant growth. In addition, breast milk
contains several biologically active components such as immu-
noglobulins, growth hormones, oligosaccharides, and microbiota
that play critical roles in infant intestinal homeostasis and
immune
development1.
Among
the
bioactive
components,
human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are the third most abun-
dant solid component after lactose and lipids. These unconju-
gated complex glycans act as prebiotics, antiadhesives, and
antimicrobials and play critical roles in altering epithelial and
immune cell responses2. HMOs are composed of five mono-
saccharide building blocks, including glucose (Glc), galactose
(Gal), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), fucose (Fuc), and sialic
acid (Sia). Over 100 HMOs have been structurally characterized;
all contain lactose at the reducing end and are extended into
complex structures by the addition of type 1 (Galβ1-3GlcNAc) or
type 2 (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) chains, fucosylation, or sialylation3. The
total amount and composition of HMOs varies between women
and are dependent on maternal genetics, environment, and geo-
graphic location4.
HMOs act as soluble decoy receptors and block the binding of
enteric pathogens such as rotavirus and Campylobacter jejuni to
structurally analogous glycan receptors on epithelial cells5,6.
HMOs also have indirect effects on the gastrointestinal epithe-
lium, such as modulation of intestinal cell differentiation and
apoptosis, which in turn can affect susceptibility to infectious
agents7. Importantly, HMOs are natural prebiotics and act as
metabolic substrates for specific commensal bacteria8; some
bacteria like Bifidobacterium infantis directly metabolize complex
HMOs9, while other microbial communities act in a concerted
manner to sequentially degrade and metabolize complex HMO
structures10. Thus HMOs, possibly together with the microbiota
in breast milk11,12, play important roles in shaping the infant gut
microbiome, modulating enteric infections, and protecting the
newborn.
Among enteric pathogens, rotaviruses are a leading cause of
severe dehydrating gastroenteritis in children under the age of
5 years worldwide13. Unlike infections in older children where
multiple strains cause diarrhea and vomiting, neonatal infections
are predominantly asymptomatic and are often associated with
unusual strains that are geographically restricted14. In some set-
tings, neonatal rotavirus infections have also been associated with
severe gastrointestinal diseases, including diarrhea, feed intoler-
ance, and necrotizing enterocolitis15,16. However, little is known
about host factors mediating differences in clinical presentations.
In this study, we focused on a unique rotavirus strain called G10P
[11] that has been associated with a stable and high incidence of
almost exclusive neonatal infections in Vellore, India15. In this
setting, G10P[11] is associated with both severe gastrointestinal
symptoms as well as asymptomatic infections15. We previously
determined that the neonatal predilection of G10P[11] is due to
the binding of the VP8* domain of the outer capsid protein VP4
to developmentally regulated precursor histo-blood group anti-
gens (HBGAs) present on the gastrointestinal epithelium17.
However, why G10P[11] was associated with symptomatic
infections in some neonates while others were asymptomatic
remained unclear.
Analysis of virological factors including whole-genome char-
acterization of virus from asymptomatic and symptomatic neo-
nates, examination of differences in viral load and virus shedding,
and the role of the environment and care givers in virus trans-
mission did not provide insight into differences in clinical pre-
sentations18–20. Since structures analogous to precursor HBGAs
are present in human milk and P[11] VP8* binds HMOs on a
shotgun milk glycan array21, we hypothesized that HMOs act as
decoy receptors, competitively inhibiting the binding of G10P[11]
to intestinal HBGAs and that differences in expression of such
HMOs may explain the differences in clinical presentation
between neonates. Multidisciplinary studies including in vitro
infectivity assays, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ana-
lysis of samples from a cohort of mother–infant pairs demon-
strate that, contrary to our hypothesis, HMOs are not decoy
receptors for G10P[11] and provide an unexpected new insight
into the pathogenesis of neonatal enteric infections. Of public
health importance, HMOs enhance the infectivity of a licensed P
[11] rotavirus vaccine, highlighting maternal factors that could
promote the performance of live, attenuated vaccines.
Results
HMOs enhance neonatal G10P[11] infectivity in vitro. The
VP8* domain of the spike protein of G10P[11] virus binds both
type I and type II HMOs on a shotgun milk glycan array21. X-ray
crystallographic studies of P[11] VP8* in complex with type I and
type II HMOs [Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and Lacto-N-neotetraose
(LNnT), respectively] revealed a previously uncharacterized
receptor-binding site in rotavirus VP8*22. To elucidate the bio-
logical relevance of these interactions and determine whether
HMOs act as soluble decoy receptors for G10P[11], infectivity
assays were carried out on African green monkey kidney epi-
thelial cells (MA104 cells), a well-established model for rotavirus
studies in vitro, using increasing concentrations of LNT and
LNnT. The highest concentrations tested were reflective of
average biological concentrations in breast milk from healthy
mothers4.
Contrary to our hypothesis, a dose-dependent enhancement in
G10P[11] infectivity was seen with LNT and LNnT (Fig. 1a), with
the greatest increase at biologically relevant concentrations. These
data suggested that LNT and LNnT are not decoy receptors for
G10P[11]. However, human breast milk contains over 100
different oligosaccharides, including other structures similar to
developmentally regulated precursor HBGAs with potential decoy
activity. We next evaluated whether a combination of HMOs
including the presence of more complex sugars leads to decoy
receptor activity by testing the effect of pooled HMOs obtained
from donor milk samples. The highest concentration of pooled
HMOs used was representative of the average total HMO
concentration in mature milk23. A dose-dependent enhancement
in G10P[11] infectivity was seen with pooled HMOs in MA104
cells (Fig. 1b), similar to the results with individual HMOs. By
contrast, a dose-dependent reduction in infectivity was observed
with a commonly used laboratory G3P[3] rotavirus of simian
origin (strain SA11-4F), tested as a control, suggesting that the
enhanced infectivity could be specific to the neonatal P[11] strain.
Infectivity assays were therefore carried out using two globally
dominant human rotavirus strains G1P[8] (strain Wa) and G2P
[4] (strain DS1), as well as a G10P[11] rotavirus strain of bovine
origin (strain B223). G10P[11] strains are a common cause of
diarrhea in cattle24–26, and phylogenetic analyses show that
human neonatal G10P[11] strains are most closely related to
G10P[11] strains that cause diarrhea in cattle19. Pooled HMOs
had no significant effect on the infectivity of the globally
dominant P[4] and P[8] human rotavirus strains while the
infectivity of both the human neonatal and bovine P[11] viruses
was significantly enhanced (Fig. 1c). These data confirm that
HMO-mediated enhancement in virus infectivity is specific to P
[11] rotaviruses. Since all HMOs contain lactose at the reducing
end, infectivity assays were carried out using lactose at the highest
concentration in pooled HMOs. The addition of lactose alone did
not recapitulate the enhanced infectivity seen with LNT, LNnT,

 or the pooled HMOs (Supplementary Figure 1). To gain
preliminary mechanistic insight into the mode of action, either
viruses or cells were preincubated with pooled HMOs prior to
infectivity assays. Pretreated cells were washed before inoculation
with virus to ensure the absence of HMO during infection. In
both experimental conditions, no HMOs were included during
the course of infection. Irrespective of whether there was
enhancement in infectivity as seen with G10P[11] or reduction
in infectivity as seen with SA11-4F, the outcome was mediated by
the effect of HMOs acting directly on the virus rather than on the
cells (Fig. 1d).
Specific HMOs correlate with symptomatic infections. There
are no animal models to study the human neonatal G10P[11]
rotavirus. Therefore, to directly determine the biological and
clinical significance of the in vitro findings for neonates, a cohort
of 181 mother–infant pairs was recruited from the neonatal
nurseries of the Christian Medical College (CMC) in Vellore,
India, where a high incidence of neonatal G10P[11] infections has
been described over a long period of time15. Based on clinical
presentations and detection of rotavirus in stool samples from the
neonates, the samples were classified into 3 groups: symptomatic
rotavirus positive (n = 56), asymptomatic rotavirus positive (n =
60), and rotavirus negative (n = 65). HMO profiles of breast milk
samples
were
characterized
for
167
samples
using
high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)27.
The
HMO
profile
is
influenced
by
maternal
genetics;
specifically, the presence of α(1,2) fucosylated HMO depends
on whether the mother is genetically a secretor (expresses a
functional α(1,2) fucosyltransferase, FUT2 enzyme) or is a non-
secretor and does not express α(1,2) fucosylated HBGAs on
epithelial surfaces and in mucosal secretions28. As anticipated,
breast milk from secretor mothers contained significantly higher
levels of α(1,2) fucosylated HMOs such as 2’-fucosyllactose (2’FL)
and lacto-N-fucopentaose I (LNFP I) that were nearly absent in
milk from non-secretors (Supplementary Figure 2). Regardless of
maternal secretor status, the HMO profile of breast milk was
similar between mothers of rotavirus-negative and asymptomatic
rotavirus-positive neonates, and significantly different from
mothers of symptomatic rotavirus-positive neonates (Fig. 2a, b,
2000 permutations, p < 0.001). Since single amino acid substitu-
tions in the FUT2 gene lead to very different overall HMO
compositions, the HMO profiles of secretors and non-secretors
were independently analyzed to determine whether specific HMO
are associated with rotavirus disease. Among secretor mothers,
the levels of 2’FL and LNT were significantly higher in the
symptomatic rotavirus group while the level of LNFP I was higher
among rotavirus positives compared to the rotavirus negative
group (Fig. 2c). Among non-secretor mothers, the levels of 6’-
sialyllactose (6’SL) and LNT were significantly higher in the
symptomatic rotavirus group while the level of LNFP II was
significantly higher in the asymptomatic rotavirus-positive group
(Fig. 2d). There were no overall differences
in rates of

Fig. 1 Human milk oligosaccharides are not decoy receptors for G10P[11] rotavirus. A dose-dependent enhancement in G10P[11] infectivity was seen with
a type I HMO Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and type II HMO Lacto-N-neo-tetraose (LNnT) as well as b pooled HMOs. The structures of LNT and LNnT are
shown in a, with the blue circle representing glucose, yellow circle representing galactose, and the blue square representing N-acetylglucosamine. This
effect was specific to P[11] rotaviruses when compared to the reduction in infectivity for a simian (Si) G3P[3] rotavirus (b) and other globally dominant
human rotavirus strains G1P[8] and G2P[4] (c). The HMO effects are mediated by an effect on the virus rather than the cells (d). All bars represent the
mean percentage of infectivity with error bars denoting standard error of mean from a minimum of three independent experiments. No HMO treatment
was considered 100% infectivity. The mean baseline titers [expressed in fluorescent focus units (FFU) per ml] for each virus strain used to denote 100%
infectivity in this figure are: human G10P[11]—8.0 × 105 FFU/ml; bovine G10P[11]—8.2 × 105 FFU/ml; G3P[3]—2.4 × 107 FFU/ml; G1P[8]—1.2 × 107 FFU/

LNT is present in milk from all mothers.
To determine how predictive individual HMOs are for
symptomatic rotavirus infection, receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves were generated by linear support vector machine
(SVM) classification. Since the rotavirus-negative and asympto-
matic rotavirus-positive groups were highly comparable overall,
these groups were combined to create a binary grouping for SVM
analysis. ROCs curves plotted for the top 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 19

Fig. 2 Specific HMOs are associated with symptomatic rotavirus infection. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminatory analysis (OPLS-DA) within
a secretors only and b non-secretors only show that the HMO profile of breast milk from mothers in the symptomatic rotavirus group are distinct from the
asymptomatic and rotavirus negative groups. This distinction is mediated by differences in the levels of LNT, 2’FL, and LNFP I in secretors (c) and by LNT,

 HMOs was 0.929 for secretors and 0.918 for non-secretors
(Fig. 2e, f, respectively). The model showing the highest accuracy
for secretors was achieved at 3 HMOs (sensitivity 87%, specificity
90%, AUC 0.934; Fig. 2e). For non-secretors, the sensitivity of
93.8% and specificity of 100% with 2 HMOs did not improve in
subsequent models containing up to 19 HMOs (Fig. 2f). These
data suggest that evaluation of a limited number of HMOs was
sufficient to predict symptomatic rotavirus infection in neonates.
LNT was the most discriminatory HMO in both secretors and
non-secretors by linear SVM, with this HMO being selected as
one of the most important in all (100%) of the models
(Supplementary Figures 3A and 3B, respectively).
To determine the functional role of 2’FL, LNFP I and II, and
6’SL identified from the population studies, the average biological
concentration of these HMOs was tested in infectivity assays with
the
neonatal
G10P[11]
virus.
Significant
enhancement
in
infectivity was seen with 2’FL and LNFP I but not with 6’SL
and LNFP II (Fig. 3a). To determine whether enhanced infectivity
is a function of VP8*–HMO binding, the binding constant (Kd)
was determined using NMR spectroscopy by monitoring the
chemical shift changes as a function of increasing ligand
concentrations for LNT, 2’FL, LNFP I, and 6’SL. The data were
globally fitted to calculate a Kd of 42 ± 2 mM for LNT (Fig. 3b),
150 ± 6 mM for LNFP I, and 313 ± 24 mM for 2’FL (Fig. 3c). The
highest binding was seen with LNT, which was the most
discriminatory HMO in both secretors and non-secretors while
no binding was seen with 6’SL (Fig. 3c). The representative NMR
peaks displayed significant chemical shift changes (1H dimen-
sion) in the two-dimensional (2D) 1H-15N heteronuclear single
quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra in the presence of the HMOs
(Supplementary Figure 4A-D), revealing the direct molecular
interactions between 15N-labeled P[11] VP8* and LNT, 2’FL, and
LNFP I in solution.
Enterobacter/Klebsiella correlate with symptomatic infection.
Since HMOs can potentially affect pathogen infectivity by
indirect mechanisms such as modulation of the infant gut
microbiome, we next characterized the breast milk and infant
stool microbiome from mother–infant samples. Unlike HMOs,
there were no differences in breast milk or infant fecal micro-
biome
based
on
maternal
secretor
status
(Supplementary
Figure 5A–B and 5C–D, respectively). The absence of difference
in infant microbiota based on maternal secretor status is different
from studies in other populations; however, maternal secretor
status is one of many factors influencing the infant gut micro-
biome, and it is likely that other population-specific factors may

Fig. 3 Variable effects of HMOs identified from field studies on rotavirus infectivity and VP8* binding. Of the HMOs identified as associated with rotavirus
infections in the field studies, only 2’FL and LNFP I but not 6’SL and LNFP II enhance G10P[11] infectivity in vitro (a). LNT was included as a positive control
while 3’SL that was not associated with rotavirus infections in the field studies was included as a negative control. All bars represent the mean percentage
of infectivity with error bars denoting standard error of the mean from a minimum of three independent experiments. No HMO treatment was considered
100% infectivity. The mean baseline titer of G10P[11] used in these experiments (100% infectivity) was 8.8 × 105 fluorescent focus units (FFU) per ml.
p value <0.05 (analysis of variance with Dunnett’s post hoc test) was considered statistically significant (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.001). Nuclear magnetic

 play a role in this difference. Indeed, a recent study in 1190

may not be associated with fecal microbial composition29.

(OPLS-DA)
of
the
HMO
dataset
(Supplementary Figure 2), weighted UniFrac principal coordinate
analysis (PCoA) ordination showed that breast milk from
mothers of symptomatic neonates clustered distinctly from the
asymptomatic and rotavirus-negative groups (permutational
multivariate analysis of variance (Permanova), p = 0.001). Similar
to the HMO results, the latter two groups were more similar to
one another and showed comparable microbiome profiles
(Fig. 4a). Relative abundance analysis of discriminatory genera
showed that, of the three most abundant genera, the relative
abundance of Enterobacter/Klebsiella (indistinguishable based on
16S V4 region used for sequencing) was significantly higher in
breast milk of mothers of symptomatic neonates [Kruskal–Wallis
(KW) test with false discovery rate (FDR), p < 0.001], while
Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. were significantly lower
(KW test with FDR, p < 0.001 and 0.03, respectively) (Fig. 4b).
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe)30 of
bacterial genera analysis corroborate these findings with Enter-
obacter/Klebsiella identified as the most discriminatory genera in
symptomatic group and Staphylococcus and Streptococcus identi-
fied as the most discriminatory genera in the rotavirus-negative
and asymptomatic groups (Fig. 4c). To determine how predictive
the 16S rRNA data are for symptomatic rotavirus infection, ROC
curves were generated by linear SVM classification (Supplemen-
tary
Figure
6).
In
concordance
with
the
LEfSe
analysis,
Enterobacter/Klebsiella was the main genera driving the predic-
tion of symptomatic infections.
Analysis of the infant fecal microbiome showed that the
symptomatic rotavirus-positive neonates were significantly dif-
ferent (p = 0.002) compared to rotavirus-negative and asympto-
matic neonates (Fig. 4d). Similar to the breast milk microbiome,
the relative abundance of Enterobacter/Klebsiella was significantly
higher in symptomatic neonates (KW test with FDR, p < 0.001;
Fig. 4e). LEfSe analysis again corroborated these findings, with
Enterobacter/Klebsiella identified as the most discriminatory
genera in symptomatic neonates and Staphylococcus as the most
discriminatory genera in rotavirus-negative and asymptomatic
infants (Fig. 4f). These data indicate a strong association of
Enterobacter/Klebsiella, whether in breast milk or in infant stool,
with gastrointestinal disease presentations in neonates and a
potential protective effect of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus
against rotavirus infection and disease.
HMO–microbiome correlations seen in symptomatic infection.
Population studies individually showed the association of HMOs
and the microbiota with symptomatic rotavirus infections. To
evaluate the interplay between these factors, we performed sparse
partial least squared (sPLS) canonical analyses to determine
correlations between concentrations of the five significant HMOs
identified in the field studies (described in Fig. 2) and the relative
abundance of the three principally significant and discriminatory
genera identified from the microbiome analyses (described in
Fig.

 symptomatic infections in the neonates were positively correlated
with Enterobacter/Klebsiella and/or negatively correlated with
Staphylococcus and Streptococcus in breast milk (Fig. 5a) and
infant stool (Fig. 5b). For example, LNT and 6’SL that are asso-
ciated with symptomatic infections were both positively corre-
lated with Enterobacter/Klebsiella and negatively correlated with
Staphylococcus in breast milk (Fig. 5a). While LNT was directly
found to enhance virus infectivity in vitro, these analyses indicate
potential roles for microbiome modulation by HMOs such as 6’SL
that were associated with symptomatic infections but without a
direct effect on G10P[11] infectivity. Similarly examining corre-
lations between infant stool microbiome and HMOs (Fig. 5b), the
negative correlations between LNT and 6’SL in breast milk and
Staphylococcus continued to be seen for the fecal microbiome
while the positive correlations with Enterobacter/Klebsiella were
lost. Conversely, 2’FL and LNFP I were positively correlated with
Enterobacter/Klebsiella in stool samples. LNFP II was the only
HMO
significantly
associated
with asymptomatic
rotavirus
infections and showed weak correlations with both breast milk
and infant fecal microbiomes. Finally, as would be expected if the
breast milk microbiome contributed to colonization of the infant
gut, comparing the relative abundance of the bacterial genera
between breast milk and infant stool showed that each genus was
positively correlated with itself between the sample types (Fig. 5c).
HMOs enhance infectivity of a live, oral rotavirus vaccine. All
rotavirus vaccines currently used worldwide are live, attenuated
viruses recommended to be administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of
age31 where breast milk components are likely to play a critical
role. A naturally attenuated neonatal virus strain belonging to the
P[11] VP4 genotype (G9P[11], strain 116E) is being used as a
rotavirus vaccine in India (Rotavac®) and has recently received
World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification for global
use32,33. Since Rotavac® and the G10P[11] strain described in this
study share the same P[11] VP4 type19, we tested the effect of
HMOs identified from our field studies on the infectivity of
Rotavac® in MA104 cells. Similar to the neonatal G10P[11] virus,
an enhancement in Rotavac® infectivity was seen with biological
concentrations of LNT, 2’FL, and LNFP I but not with 6’SL
(Fig. 6). These data suggest that maternal HMO profiles, both
through direct effects on vaccine replication and/or possibly
through indirect effects mediated by the microbiome, may be an
important and previously unexplored factor contributing to dif-
ferences in rotavirus vaccine take between children.
Discussion
Breast milk is dynamic and has evolved over millennia to provide
nourishment for the newborn infant. The antimicrobial and
immunomodulatory effects of bioactive components such as
HMOs are key for protection of the infant from infectious agents
at a developmental stage where the infant’s own immune system

 is relatively immature and naive. However, susceptibility to
infection and clinical outcome is also modulated by how the
pathogen counters host restriction. This study exemplifies
microbial success in an evolutionary arms race between host and
pathogens. While the pathogen appears to exploit abundantly
available breast milk factors to cause disease in neonates, this
dominance is limited to a highly age-restricted neonatal niche,
perhaps suggesting an evolutionary cost for this adaptation.
A key strength of this study is the validation of in vitro findings
in a relevant human population, thereby addressing long-
standing clinical and epidemiological questions on neonatal
rotavirus infections and disease. For decades, it has been evident
that neonatal rotavirus infections are clinically and epidemiolo-
gically distinct from infections in older children14,17. Neonatal
infections are predominantly asymptomatic and are often asso-
ciated with unusual strains that show remarkable genetic stability
and persist in specific settings for long periods of time34,35. There
are geographic differences in the circulation of strains causing
neonatal infections, with P[11] strains described in India and P[6]
infections in Asia and Africa35–37. Very few studies have eval-
uated factors that drive the neonatal predilection of these strains
or identified mediators of differences in clinical presentation
between neonates. Addressing these questions at a molecular and
translational level is challenging when infections occur at low
frequencies or involve multiple strains of a pathogen. We focused
on the G10P[11] strain that has been demonstrated to cause a
high incidence of almost exclusive neonatal infections over a long
period of time15. Having a clearly defined, age-restricted popu-
lation with infection by a single strain allowed us to directly
examine the role of breast milk bioactive components in infection
and disease. We demonstrate previously unrecognized roles for
bioactive components in breast milk in neonatal rotavirus infec-
tion and disease presentation, setting the foundation for new
studies on these factors in infection with other rotavirus strains.
In order to inform clinical practice and provide guidance for
the use of expressed breast milk, it is critical to understand how
HMOs and/or the presence of specific bacteria translate to clinical
presentations. The differences in clinical presentations are unli-
kely to be mediated by changes in viral load alone since the
enhancement in infectivity in vitro, while significant, is modest in
terms of differences in virus yield. This corresponds to data from
epidemiological studies where no clear differences in viral load
between
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
neonates
were
observed20. Modulation of the microbiome and mucosal immune
responses by HMOs resulting in reduction in rotavirus diarrhea
with a porcine rotavirus strain has previously been demonstrated
in a piglet model38. While the protective effects of HMOs in the
piglet model contrast our findings in human neonates, it is
important to note that the animal studies were carried out with a
distinct and homologous porcine rotavirus strain. The host-range
restriction of human-specific rotaviruses is a significant barrier
for meaningful mechanistic studies in animal models. Indeed,
there is currently no animal model for the human neonatal G10P
[11] rotavirus strain. The profile of HMOs in fecal samples is
similar to breast milk early in lactation (prior to 2 months)1 and
is unlikely to provide mechanistic insight into the relationship
between HMO utilization and microbiome composition. Deli-
neating epithelial responses using in vitro co-culture studies to
determine how specific HMOs influence rotavirus and Enter-
obacter/Klebsiella infectivity will be useful to understand how
these factors modulate gastrointestinal disease in neonates.
Technological advances in the field of physiologically relevant
culture systems for enteric pathogens (such as human intestinal
enteroids and organoids) are evaluating platforms that allow co-
culture of pathogens with intestinal microbial communities39 and
are likely to be valuable future tools to directly assess how the
interplay between HMOs, microbiome, and rotavirus infection
modulates gastrointestinal symptoms.
From preliminary mechanistic studies, it is evident that bio-
logically relevant concentrations of HMOs can exert a direct
effect on the virus (Fig. 1d). HMOs are known to resist degra-
dation by the low pH and enzymatic environment of the stomach
and reach the distal small intestine in an intact form1; therefore
these HMO concentrations are likely to be present at the site of
rotavirus infection in the human gut. Similar to an effect of
lipopolysaccharide on poliovirus stability40, it is possible that the
HMOs confer structural stability to the G10P[11] rotavirus par-
ticle and improve the efficiency of virus uptake by cells. Alter-
natively, it is possible that the virus potentially hijacks a cellular
entry pathway utilized for HMO transport to gain entry into cells.
In-depth mechanistic studies are required to dissect whether the
virus acquires fitness advantage through interactions with HMOs.
Our results highlight the need for choosing appropriate viral
strains and HMOs when delineating human host–pathogen
interactions. Fundamental questions on how specific host factors
impact pathogen infectivity are often addressed using laboratory-
adapted strains of pathogens. As seen in Fig. 1b, the use of a
widely used simian rotavirus strain provided the opposite results
(reduction in infectivity) when compared to a clinically relevant
neonatal strain while there were no significant effects on globally
dominant human rotaviruses belonging to the P[4] and P[8]
genotypes that infect older children. By contrast, 3’-sialyllactose
(3’SL) and 6’SL that showed no effect on the infectivity of the
neonatal G10P[11] strain have been demonstrated to reduce the
infectivity of globally dominant human rotaviruses5. Further, not
every finding from in vitro studies translated to the population or
vice versa. For example, LNnT, which also enhanced virus
infectivity in MA104 cells, was not a discriminatory HMO
associated with rotavirus infections in the field studies. These data
underscore the importance of studying relevant strains of a
pathogen and validating host factors in relevant populations
when designing studies to address clinical or epidemiological
questions.
There are several important implications of this work. From a
broad public health perspective, the findings of this study provide
new considerations for breastfeeding and childhood immuniza-
tions, particularly for rotavirus vaccines. All licensed rotavirus
vaccines currently in use are live, attenuated virus strains that are
orally administered early in life. While rotavirus vaccines have
been introduced in nearly 100 countries, they remain less effi-
cacious in developing countries with the highest burden of dis-
ease41.
Two
independently
identified,
emerging
themes
explaining the differences in the performance of rotavirus vac-
cines are the infants’ genetically determined HBGA status42,43
and specific differences in the intestinal microbiome44,45; how-
ever, these studies considered only infant factors influencing
vaccine response. As can be anticipated for infants receiving
vaccines at 6–14 weeks of age, maternal factors are highly likely to
influence immune response to live, oral vaccines. Historically,
most studies evaluating the impact of maternal factors focused
only on maternal antibodies. Previous population studies eval-
uated breast milk immunoglobulin A, neutralizing antibodies,
lactoferrin, lactadherin, and Tenascin-C in rotavirus vaccine
response with varying outcomes46–49. The findings from our
study add to an increasing body of evidence suggesting a role for
other bioactive components in breast milk such as HMO and the
microbiome
in
impacting
vaccine/pathogen
infectivity
and
immune responses1,12,50–52. This provides an impetus for eva-
luation of the role of bioactive components in breast milk in
modulating rotavirus vaccine responses where a clear correlate of
protection or vaccine failure remains to be identified. Indeed,
increased vaccine virus replication in the presence of specific and

 pooled HMOs as seen with Rotavac® (Fig. 6) suggest that
maternal genetics and HMO profile, with either direct effects on
virus replication or indirectly through modulation of the micro-
biome, may be previously unrecognized factors affecting vaccine
response. The relative contribution of different bioactive com-
ponents may influence overall immunity as undiluted breast milk
has been demonstrated to reduce P[11] infectivity in vitro53.
The naturally attenuated infectivity of some neonatal strains
resulted in their development as new rotavirus vaccines. One
neonatal strain-derived, low-cost vaccine has received WHO
prequalification for global use (Rotavac) while another vaccine
(RV3-BB) is currently in phase III clinical trials33,54. These new
vaccines target developing country populations where current
vaccines are less efficacious. The identification of specific HMOs
or microbial communities that improve vaccine virus replication
provides innovative new avenues to improve oral vaccine
response and efficacy, including guiding the identification and
development of specific prebiotics and probiotics that can
improve the performance of oral rotavirus vaccines. While the
modest increases in viral load are unlikely to impact the
attenuation phenotype, even minor increases in vaccine take are
likely to be highly impactful at the population level in settings of
poor vaccine response. With 95% of rotavirus mortality occurring
disproportionately in children in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia,
improving rotavirus vaccine efficacy by even 15% could save lives
of an estimated 400,000 children in the next two decades55,56. A
parallel example has recently been described for influenza vac-
cines where 2’FL was found to improve innate and adaptive
immune responses in a murine vaccination model57.
The enhancement in infectivity with individual HMOs also
raises new considerations for the inclusion of specific HMOs in
infant formula. Infant formula are produced predominantly from
bovine milk that does not contain a similar repertoire and
abundance of oligosaccharides as human milk. Clinical trials
testing infant formula supplemented with 2’FL showed similar
HMO uptake and growth in infants compared to breast-fed
infants58. Large-scale preparations of 2’FL and LNnT are now
available59. Adding to the cautionary note on the absence of data
on potentially harmful effects of long-term use of a single HMO
in the absence of complex mixtures present naturally in milk60,
the findings from the present study emphasize the need for
extensive evaluation of individual components before introduc-
tion for infant nutrition.
The absence of data on infant secretor status is a limitation of
this study. The identification of secretor status from neonatal
fecal samples is technically challenging, with the presence of
maternal cells confounding the specificity of results. The collec-
tion of other relevant biological specimens such as saliva and
serum from neonates was not feasible. However, infant secretor
status is less likely to be a significant variable in the outcome of
infection since we previously demonstrated that the VP8* domain
of P[11] viruses binds developmentally regulated precursor gly-
cans on epithelial cells whose expression is independent of infant
secretor status17. Second, some demographic characteristics of
symptomatic neonates were significantly different from the
asymptomatic rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative neonates
(Supplementary Table 1), although a previous study involving
nearly 1300 neonates in the same population did not identify
factors such as gestational age or mode of delivery to be asso-
ciated with symptomatic rotavirus infections15. How these factors
influence the composition of HMO and microbiome in breast
milk is currently understudied. We found no significant differ-
ences in the HMO composition based on mode of delivery or
gestational age of the neonate among secretor mothers. Among
non-secretor mothers, while there were no significant differences
in the HMO composition based on mode of delivery, the levels of
6’SL and LNT were significantly higher (analysis of variance
(ANOVA), p < 0.05) among mothers of preterm neonates com-
pared to term neonates. However, it should be noted that there
were only 7 preterm neonates in this group limiting our ability to
draw any meaningful conclusions. In addition, there were no
significant differences in the abundance of Enterobacter/Kleb-
siella, Staphylococcus, or Streptococcus in breast milk based on
gestational age or mode of delivery within each study group
(Supplementary Figure 8). Finally, the absence of direct evidence
for the role of the microbiome in symptomatic disease is another
limitation. It is possible that some of the differences in infant gut
microbiome are a consequence of infection and not a direct
mediator of symptoms. It is also possible that a specific micro-
biome configuration could be required for symptomatic infection.
Since it is difficult to directly determine the functional effects of
the microbiome only with sequencing datasets, future studies
involving co-culture of rotavirus with specific bacteria in the
presence and absence of HMOs and in physiologically relevant
platforms will be needed.
Overall, bridging the gap between the laboratory bench and the
population, integrating molecular virology, NMR, and field stu-
dies provided new molecular and translational insight into the
complex interplay between HMO, milk microbiome, and infant
gut microbiome in neonatal enteric viral infection and disease. At
a global level, the benefits of providing expressed breast milk far
outweigh risks associated with enhanced infectivity of a unique
neonatal rotavirus strain. However, the association of specific
maternal factors with gastrointestinal presentations warrants
further mechanistic investigation into the contribution of these
factors to changes in intestinal permeability and homeostasis.
Apart from addressing key questions on neonatal rotavirus
infections, our findings have broad implications for neonatal
enteric infections, lactation research, manufacturing infant for-
mula, and vaccine studies.
Methods
Viruses, cells, and HMOs. Rotavirus infections were carried out on MA104 cells
(African green monkey kidney epithelial cells, originally obtained from Dr. T. H.
Flewett, Birmingham, UK)61. Rotaviruses are classified by a binary nomenclature
system based on the genes encoding outer capsid proteins VP7 (G type) and VP4
(P type)62. Infectivity assays were carried out with a neonatal G10P[11] rotavirus
isolate N1509 [stock titer 1.11E + 06 fluorescent focus units (FFU)/ml] that was
previously adapted to cell culture by multiple passages on MA104 cells17. Other
well-characterized rotavirus strains include simian rotavirus SA11 variant 4F SA11-
4F (stock titer 8.98E + 06 FFU/ml), bovine G10P[11] rotavirus B223 (stock titer
8.22E + 05 FFU/ml), human G1P[8] rotavirus strain Wa (stock titer 9.60E + 06
FFU/ml), and human G2P[4] rotavirus strain DS1 (stock titer 5.15E + 06 FFU/ml).
The MA104 cells and all rotavirus strains were serially passaged in the Estes
Laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine. The G9P[11] rotavirus vaccine Rotavac®
(1.0E + 05 FFU/ml) was donated for use in the study by Bharat Biotech Interna-
tional Ltd.
Pooled HMOs were prepared from donor milk samples using centrifugation,
filtration, and chromatography as previously described63. Milk from >50 donors
was pooled to account for heterogeneity in HMO composition between different
women. HMO composition was analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry to
ensure relative consistency of HMO composition among batches. The pooled
preparation contained 22.8% LNT, 16.5% 2’FL, 10.0% LNFP I, 11.4%
difucosyllacto-N-tetraose, 2.7% 3’SL, 1.9% LNnT, 1.6% 6’SL, 16.9% LNFP II, 1.7%
sialyllacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc), 2.8% 3’FL, 0.4% sialyllacto-N-tetraose b (LSTb),
0.4% LNFP III, 1.1% disialyllactose-N-tetraose (DSLNT), and several other HMOs
with <1% relative abundance. Pooled HMOs were lyophilized for long-term
storage. Individual HMOs (2’FL, LNT, LNFP I, LNFP II, and 6’SL) were purchased
from Dextra. Appropriate concentrations of lyophilized HMOs were weighed,
diluted into cell culture media (0% Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium), and used
in infectivity assays.
Infectivity assays. The effect of HMOs on rotavirus infectivity was assessed
through standard fluorescent focus assays on MA104 cells described as previously
described5. MA104 cells are highly permissive to rotavirus infection and are a well-
established cell line for rotavirus infectivity assays in laboratories worldwide. We
and others have used MA104 cells to evaluate the effects of glycans on multiple
rotavirus strains, including the genotype studied in this work5,53,61. Briefly,

 confluent MA104 monolayers on 96-well plates were incubated overnight in
serum-free media prior to infection. Rotavirus strains were activated with 10 µg/ml
of trypsin at 37 °C for half an hour. The dilutions of virus that yielded approxi-
mately 100–200 FFU per well were suspended in media with and without HMOs at
specified concentrations and allowed to bind to MA104 cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The
inoculum was removed and the cells were washed once with serum-free media to
remove any unbound virus. Media (with or without HMO) was then added, and
the infection was allowed to continue for 15 h. Cells were then fixed with ice-cold
methanol and intracellular viral antigen was detected using an anti-rotavirus
polyclonal rabbit primary antibody followed by a fluorescently conjugated anti-
rabbit secondary antibody (Alexa FluorTM 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
antibody). The number of infected cells was counted and expressed as FFU/ml.
Modifications of this protocol were used to determine whether the effect of HMOs
was on the virus or the cells. To determine whether HMOs had a direct effect on
the virus, N1509 or SA11-4F was preincubated with pooled HMOs at 37 °C for 2 h
prior to infection. Alternatively, MA104 cells were treated with HMOs overnight at
37 °C. The cells were pretreated for a longer duration when compared to pre-
treatment of the virus because extended incubation of Caco-2 cells in the presence
of HMOs was shown to alter the expression of cell surface glycans affecting
adhesion of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli64. To determine the effect of HMOs
on cells, MA104 cells were washed following pretreatment with HMOs and then
inoculated with virus. For effects on the virus, pretreated virus strains were
inoculated on cells as described above. In both cases, HMOs were not included
during the 15 h course of infection. Infectivity in the absence of HMOs served as
the control in all experiments.
Translational study design. The field component of the study was carried out in
the neonatal nurseries and post-natal units of CMC, a 2700-bed tertiary care
referral hospital in Vellore, India as described in previous epidemiological studies
in this population15. Briefly, samples and clinical data were collected after informed
consent was obtained from mothers of neonates hospitalized at CMC. Trained
study nurses were available in the nurseries round the clock for consent, recruit-
ment, and sample collection. Stool samples from neonates admitted in the neonatal
nurseries for over 48 h with gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea,
vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, gastrointestinal bleed, necrotizing enterocolitis,
pneumatosis intestinalis, abdominal distension, and/or feed intolerance) were
screened for rotavirus using an enzyme immunoassay (ProSpecT, Thermofisher
Scientific, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stool samples from
infants admitted for >48 h in the post-natal units with non-enteric pathology or
where the hospitalization was for maternal causes were tested to identify asymp-
tomatically infected neonates and rotavirus-negative neonates. Molecular char-
acterization of G and P types were carried out on rotavirus-positive stool
samples15. At least one breast milk sample was collected from each mother as soon
as feasible after recruitment of the mother–infant dyad. For breast milk collection,
mothers were instructed to clean the breast with soap and water before collection of
breast milk and then expressed breastmilk into a sterile container. We did not
discard the first milk or clean with any disinfectant since babies receive the
microbiome of the skin as well as that in the breastmilk. Neonates with gastro-
intestinal symptoms were admitted in the tertiary level nursery where pooled breast
milk from mothers is given to neonates without matching of mother and neonate.
Therefore, a sample of the pooled breastmilk actually given to each infant was
collected for the first 10 feeds after recruitment. Since no significant differences
were observed in HMO profile between different feeds (Supplementary Figure 7),
data from the first sample was used for subsequent analysis. The remaining
asymptomatic and rotavirus-negative neonates received direct breast milk.
Demographic information on the study population is given in Supplementary
Table 1.
HMO analysis. The amount and composition of HMOs in breast milk samples was
analyzed by HPLC after labeling with the fluorescent tag 2-aminobenzamide as
described previously27. The well-established method allows for absolute quantifi-
cation of the 19 most abundant and structurally distinct HMOs (that constitute
>95% total HMOs), including 2’FL, 3’FL, 3’SL, LNT, LNnT, LNFP I, LNFP II,
LNFP III, LSTb, LSTc, or DSLNT. Maternal secretor status was identified based on
the presence or near-absence of 2’FL in breast milk.
P[11] VP8* protein expression and NMR spectroscopy. Recombinant N-
terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged P[11] VP8* were expressed in E.
coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) and purified with Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast
Flow (GE Healthcare) affinity column as described previously17,22. The GST tag
was removed by the treatment with protease thrombin overnight at 4 °C and
rebinding the protein mixture to the Glutathione Sepharose column. The VP8* was
further purified by size exclusion column Superdex75 (GE Healthcare) with 10 mM
Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol at 4 °C. The concentration of the
purified protein was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and using an
absorption coefficient of 32,430/M/cm for VP8* calculated using ProtPraram on
the ExPASy server65. 1H-15N-labeled P[11] VP8* was purified and ligands were
dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, and 10% D2O buffer, pH 7.
NMR experiments were performed on Avance III HD 800 MHz Ascend™ Bruker
instrument equipped with quadruple resonance inverse detection QCI CryoPro-
beTM (NMR and Drug Discovery Core, Baylor College of Medicine). 2D 1H-15N
HSQC NMR experiments were collected on P[11] VP8* (70 μM) using various
ligand concentrations (0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 5, 8, 20 mM). NMR spectra were analyzed using
the NMRPipe66 and NMRFAM-Sparky67 software. Chemical shift changes in the
1H dimension for nine peaks were used to calculate Kd for the VP8:LNT glycan
complex. The binding data for all glycans were globally fit to the general binding
model “ML ↔ M + L” using the equation
Y ¼

where MT is the total M concentration independent of ligation state, Y is Dd1H, YM
and YML are the binding transition baselines, and [ML] = (−b − (b2 − 4ac)0.5)/2a,
with a = 1, b = −Kd−[MT]−[LT], and c = [MT][LT], as described previously68.
16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from breast
milk and stool samples using MOBIO PowerMag DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO
Laboratories; San Diego, CA). The 16S rDNA V4 region was amplified by PCR
using barcoded Illumina adapter-containing primers 515F and 806R69 and
sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina; SanDiego, CA) using the 2 × 250 bp
paired-end protocol yielding pair-end reads. Sequencing read pairs were demulti-
plexed based on the unique molecular barcodes, and reads were merged using
USEARCH v7.0.109070. Merging allowed zero mismatches and a minimum overlap
of 50 bases, and merged reads were trimmed at the first base with a Q ≤ 5. In
addition, a quality filter was applied to the resulting merged reads and those
containing >0.05% expected errors were discarded. Sequences were stepwise clus-
tered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a similarity cutoff value of 97%
using the UPARSE algorithm71. Chimeras were removed using USEARCH
v7.0.1090. OTUs were determined by mapping the centroids to the SILVA v128
database72 containing only the 16S rRNA V4 region to determine taxonomies. We
utilized multiple quality-control (QC) measures, including the use of non-template
controls, at the microbial DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene amplification, and
amplicon sequencing processes for QC purposes. Breast milk and stool samples
were processed in separate extraction and sequencing runs totaling six individual
runs. Each extraction and sequencing run included a set of controls used routinely
in the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research (CMMR) at
Baylor College of Medicine as part of its quality management program in con-
formity with its CLIA certification. Controls consisted of negative or blank reagent-
only controls, and positive controls consisted of a previously characterized bacterial
isolate carried through all the steps of the pipeline. In all cases, the positive control
yielded >20,000 sequencing reads of which >99% mapped to the known bacterial
isolate. All reagent-only negative controls yielded <500 sequencing reads of which
<20% were mapped to bacteria. These results were in line with the guidelines
established by the CMMR to maintain QC and assurance of the projects processed
through the center. Resulting OTU tables were rarified to 940 reads per sample. In
total, 3,047,373 reads passed QC and were successfully mapped, with 313,020 reads
included in the final analysis at 940 reads/sample.
Statistical analyses. For infectivity assays, each experimental condition was tested
a minimum of three times, with technical replicates for each virus and HMO
concentration within each assay. Virus titer measured in the absence of HMOs was
considered to be 100% infectivity; change in virus titer in the presence of HMOs
was expressed as the percentage of infectivity compared with no HMO treatment.
Percentage of infectivity in the presence of each HMO was compared to the per-
centage of infectivity in the absence of HMOs as described previously5. No com-
parisons between different HMOs or between two concentrations of the same
HMO were carried out. In the population studies, the levels of each HMO were
compared between milk from mothers of symptomatic, asymptomatic, and
rotavirus-negative neonates. All statistical analyses for infectivity assays and HMO
profiles were performed with use of ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test on
GraphPad Prism version 6.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Multiplicity-
adjusted p values were determined, with p values <0.05 considered to be statistically
significant.
Microbiota data PCoA ordination plots were based on weighted UniFrac
distances73 and significance between symptomatic rotavirus infection,
asymptomatic rotavirus infection, and negative infection was determined by
Permanova. Significant differences in the relative abundance of bacterial genera
between groups were determined by KW test74. All p values were adjusted for
multiple comparisons with the FDR algorithm and p values <0.05 after adjustment
for multiple comparisons were considered significant. Microbiome statistics and
figure generation were performed in R using the ggplot package75. LEfSe30 was
performed using the Galaxy interface. LEfSe uses the non-parametric factorial KW
sum-rank test to detect features with significant differential abundance between
success or failure groups. LEfSe further uses LDA to estimate the effect size of
each differentially abundant feature. An LDA cutoff of 4.0 and significance value
(p value) of 0.05 were applied.
The HMO data underwent OPLS-DA using MetaboAnalyst 3.076 and validated
using 2000 random permutations. To determine the predictivity of individual
HMOs as a marker for symptomatic rotavirus infection, ROC curves were
generated in MetaboAnalyst 3.0 by linear SVM classification with Monte-Carlo

 cross-validation using balanced subsampling. In each Monte-Carlo cross-
validation, two thirds of the samples were used to examine the feature importance
and the classification model was validated using the one third of samples left out.
Several iterations were performed with increasing number of HMOs to determine
the optimal number of metabolites to predict symptomatic rotavirus infection, with
analysis based on 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, or 19 of the top HMOs based on the selected
frequency. Within- and between-subject pairwise comparisons of temporal breast
milk samples was performed on samples obtained from at least four feeds based on
the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity distance77 using the Vegan package78. The
significance of within- and between-subject distances was calculated by Wilcox test.
Statistics and figure generation was performed in R using the ggplot package75.
MixOmics79 was implemented in R version 3.3 to determine the correlations
between the significant HMOs and significant bacterial genera in breast milk and
stool. MixOmixs uses sPLS regression and was performed in canonical mode with
LASSO penalization80.
