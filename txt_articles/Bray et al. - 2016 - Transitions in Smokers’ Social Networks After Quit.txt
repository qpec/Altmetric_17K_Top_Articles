Abstract
Introduction: Smokers’ social networks vary in size, composition, and amount of exposure to 
smoking. 
The extent to which smokers’ social networks change after a quit attempt is unknown, as 
is the relation between quitting success and later network changes.
Methods: Unique types of social networks for 691 smokers enrolled in a smoking-cessation trial 
were identified based on network size, new network members, members’ smoking habits, within 
network smoking, smoking buddies, and romantic partners’ smoking. Latent transition analysis 
was used to identify the network classes and to predict transitions in class membership across 
3 years from biochemically assessed smoking abstinence.
Results: Five network classes were identified: Immersed (large network, extensive smoking expo-
sure including smoking buddies), Low Smoking Exposure (large network, minimal smoking expo-
sure), Smoking Partner (small network, smoking exposure primarily from partner), Isolated (small 
network, minimal smoking exposure), and Distant Smoking Exposure (small network, consider-
able nonpartner smoking exposure). Abstinence at years 1 and 2 was associated with shifts in 
participants’ social networks to less contact with smokers and larger networks in years 2 and 3.
Conclusions: In the years following a smoking-cessation attempt, smokers’ social networks 
changed, and abstinence status predicted these changes. Networks defined by high levels of 
exposure to smokers were especially associated with continued smoking. Abstinence, however, 
predicted transitions to larger social networks comprising less smoking exposure. These results 
support treatments that aim to reduce exposure to smoking cues and smokers, including partners 
who smoke.
Implications: Prior research has shown that social network features predict the likelihood of sub-
sequent smoking cessation. 
The current research illustrates how successful quitting predicts social 
network change over 3 years following a quit attempt. Specifically, abstinence predicts transitions 
to networks that are larger and afford less exposure to smokers. 
This suggests that quitting smok-
ing may expand a person’s social milieu rather than narrow it. This effect, plus reduced exposure 
to smokers, may help sustain abstinence.

Introduction
Despite the well-known risks of smoking, approximately 18% of 
US adults smoke and 2100 youth become regular smokers every-
day.1 Each of these smokers exists within a social network of fam-
ily, friends, coworkers, community members, and others. The size, 
amount of support, and composition of these networks, includ-
ing the number of smokers in the social network, vary by person. 
Understanding how social networks and smoking influence one 
another over time may illuminate important influences on smoking 
initiation, cessation, and relapse risk.
Much of the research on social networks and smoking has 
focused on the relations between network features and smoking ini-
tiation or escalation among adolescents or younger smokers. Such 
research, for instance, shows that having a large number of daily 
smokers in one’s social network is a risk factor for becoming a daily 
smoker2 and for having a higher trajectory of future use (ie, smoking 
more cigarettes per day over time3). One mechanism underlying such 
patterns may be that adolescent smokers tend to sort into groups 
based on shared smoking behaviors.4 For example, among adoles-
cents, low smokers tend to befriend other low smokers, and smokers 
tend to drop low smokers from their social groups.4,5 Thus, smoking 
may run in social networks because smokers seek each other out, 
rather than because smoking spreads within networks.6 Other social 
network factors, such as social isolation, have also been linked to 
increased risk for smoking among adolescents.7,8
Research on the social networks of adult smokers has shown 
clearly that smoking within the social network, especially partner 
smoking, decreases smokers’ odds of quitting successfully.9–12 For 
instance, the Four Country Survey found that reductions in contact 
with smokers from wave 1 to wave 2 increased intent to quit, quit 
attempts, and successful cessation at wave 2.13 Other social network 
factors, such as high social capital or support from close members 
of the network, have been linked to lower smoking rates and greater 
cessation success.14–20 Some research suggests mechanisms by which 
social networks may affect cessation among adults. Observational 
data from the Framingham Heart Study suggests that smoking within 
a network influences network members’ smoking through multiple 
mechanisms, including social norms, increased opportunity, and sec-
ondhand smoke exposure.21 The authors asserted that social norms 
may be particularly influential and may be expressed via requests not 
to smoke, decreased availability of cigarettes, or smoking cessation 
within the network. Consistent with these ideas, successful quitters 
have attributed their motivation to quit to being pressured by others, 
wanting to set a good example, and feeling isolated as a smoker.22,23 
Of course, the concentration of smoking within social networks 
might be influenced by multiple mechanisms. Because most relevant 
data arise from observational, cross-sectional studies, it is difficult to 
draw firm conclusions about mechanisms.24,25
The current study expands on prior research by focusing on the 
nature of social networks among adult smokers and how cessation is 
related to changes in network composition. Although it is clear that 
smoking can influence adolescents’ friendships,5 and that network 
features can affect likelihood of cessation among adult smokers,11 
little is known about how successful cessation is related to subse-
quent network change among adults. Furthermore, previous studies 
have focused primarily on one type of social contact, such as friends, 
or have aggregated the total number of contacts into a composite 
score of social capital. In the current study, we focus on multiple 
types of social contacts, including friends, smoking buddies, and 
romantic partners, which allows us to identify various profiles of 
social networks and which types of social contacts are most and least 
likely to change over time. Although we have made great progress 
in understanding how quitting smoking affects physical and mental 
health,26,27 we have made much less progress in understanding how 
it affects social context.
The goal of the current study is to use data from a longitudi-
nal smoking cessation clinical trial to characterize social networks 
among smokers and to examine whether smoking status after a quit 
attempt predicts long-term change (ie, from year-to-year across a 
3-year period) in multiple dimensions of smokers’ social environ-
ments, including contact with smokers. This issue is potentially 
important because some network changes might support abstinence 
(eg, loss of smokers from the network, reduced contact with smok-
ers, increased contact with nonsmokers), whereas other changes 
might undermine abstinence28–30 (eg, reduced network size, reduced 
social closeness from loss of smoking friends). Such information may 
yield insights into the processes that sustain or counter abstinence 
and could inform interventions.31,32
Methods
Participants
A total of 1504 smokers (58% female, 83% Caucasian) initially 
enrolled in a long-term smoking-cessation trial conducted in 
Madison and Milwaukee, WI.33 All participants smoked at least 
10 cigarettes/day on average for at least the past 6 months, had an 
alveolar carbon monoxide (CO) level greater than 9 parts per mil-
lion (ppm), and were motivated to quit smoking. Participants were 
excluded for using any form of tobacco other than cigarettes, cur-
rently taking bupropion, having a current psychosis or schizophre-
nia diagnosis, or for having medical contraindications for any of 
the study medications. All participants provided written informed 
consent, and the study was approved by the University of Wisconsin 
Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.
Study Sample
For the current analysis, participants (n = 691; 58% female) were 
included if they completed the assessment at baseline and at 1, 2, or 
3 years post-target quit date (TQD) and provided data for predic-
tors of interest (eg, demographic characteristics). Participants identi-
fied as Caucasian (83%), African American (14%), or another racial 
group (3%). At baseline, participants reported smoking an average 
of 21 cigarettes/day (SD = 8.9). The reduced sample was not dif-
ferent from the full sample on gender, race, or average number of 
cigarettes smoked at baseline. The reduced sample was slightly older 
(mean = 45.79, SD = 10.64) than the full sample (mean = 43.68, 
SD = 11.36; t[1502] = 3.70, p < .05).
Procedures
Interested smokers completed a telephone screen. Potentially eli-
gible smokers attended an information session where they learned 
about the study and provided written informed consent. Next, par-
ticipants completed three in-person baseline sessions in which they 
underwent further screening and completed demographic, smoking 
history, and tobacco dependence assessments. Participants also com-
pleted a social network assessment interview in which they identified 
the most important members (up to nine) of their social networks 
and whether they had romantic partners. As part of this extensive 
interview, participants reported the following for each member of 
their network: gender, age, relationship (eg, family, friend), in what

setting s/he saw this person (eg, socially, work/school), how often 
s/he socialized with this person, the amount of emotional support 
this person provided, the amount of stress this person created, and 
this person’s smoking patterns, including whether s/he and this per-
son smoked with one another. We also asked participants to report 
whether network members were considered “smoking buddies,” 
defined as people with whom they spent time on a regular basis to 
engage in activities that centered around smoking. The social net-
work assessments were repeated at each annual assessment (1, 2, 
3 years post-TQD); participants were asked to update their network 
members and assessments of them.
Eligible participants were randomized in a double-blind manner 
to one of six treatment conditions: (1) bupropion, (2) nicotine loz-
enge, (3) nicotine patch, (4) nicotine patch + nicotine lozenge, (5) 
bupropion + nicotine lozenge, or (6) placebo. In addition to phar-
macotherapy, all participants received six one-on-one counseling 
sessions based upon the Public Health Service Clinical Practice 
Guideline.34 Smoking status (CO < 10 
ppm = abstinent) was assessed 
at study visits on their TQD (ie, baseline), at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks 
post-TQD, and at 1, 2, and 3 years post-TQD.
Smokers’ Social Network Indicators
From the social network assessment interview, nine indicators were 
used to identify and describe smokers’ types of social networks using 
smoking-specific network characteristics (eg, smoking buddies, time 
spent with smokers), as well as general network characteristics (eg, 
network size, new members). We focused on these indicators because 
of our interest in understanding how smokers’ networks changed 
with respect to smoking-related characteristics following a smoking 
cessation attempt.
The selected indicators were coded as binary variables based on 
self-report responses regarding members of participants’ networks 
(see Table 1). Cutpoints were determined based on empirical distri-
butions across the response options (in order to achieve meaningful 
numbers of participants at each level) and on theoretical considera-
tions. The nine indicators included the following.
(1) Network size indicated whether participants identified nine 
members (the total possible, excluding romantic partners) in their 
networks (yes/no). On average, adults have about 300 meaningful 
ties with others and in-depth interviews, like the one used in this 
study, facilitate reporting.35 However, recall biases appear after ask-
ing individuals to recall more than about nine bits of information.36 
This indicator served as a proxy for comparatively large versus 
comparatively small social networks (ie, it served as an indicator of 
social isolation). (2) New members indicated whether participants 
reported that there were two or more new members in their net-
works since the last assessment (yes/no). (3) Daily smokers indicated 
whether participants identified two or more network members as 
daily smokers (yes/no). (4) Never-smokers indicated whether par-
ticipants identified two or more network members as never-smok-
ers (yes/no). (5) Smoking exposure via network indicated whether 
participants reported that two or more network members smoked 
a medium amount or a lot when the participant was with them 
 
(yes/no). (6) Smoking with network members indicated whether par-
ticipants reported that they had two or more network members with 
whom they smoked a medium amount or a lot when they were with 
the members (yes/no). (7) Smoking buddy group indicated whether 
participants reported that they had smoking buddies (in-network or 
not). (8) Smoking buddies in network indicated whether participants 
reported that at least one of the individuals they identified as part of 
their networks was a smoking buddy (yes/no). (9) Romantic part-
ner who smokes daily indicated participants who reported that they 
were living with a romantic partner (eg, spouse, domestic partner) 
who smoked daily (no = the participant either did not have a partner 
or the partner did not smoke).
Predictors of Social Network Classes
Demographic characteristics, network size at baseline, cigarettes 
smoked per day at baseline, and treatment status were considered 
as predictors of social network classes at 1 year post-TQD and 
abstinence was considered as a predictor of transitions at 2 and 
3 years post-TQD. Demographic characteristics included gender

(male/female), race (Caucasian/non-Caucasian), and age (continu-
ous). Baseline network size assessed how many network members 
participants named pre-TQD (0–9); baseline cigarettes assessed how 
many cigarettes participants smoked per day on average pre-TQD 
(continuous). Abstinence (yes/no) at 1, 2, and 3 years post-TQD 
was biochemically assessed (CO < 10 
ppm = abstinent). Intervention 
group membership was coded as placebo or active pharmacotherapy.
Analysis Plan
Statistical analyses proceeded in four steps. First, frequency tables were 
used as descriptive statistics to examine the distributions of the smok-
ers’ social network indicators at 1, 2, and 3 years post-TQD. Second, we 
used latent class analysis (LCA) and latent transition analysis (LTA)37,38 
to identify and describe the number of subgroups of individuals across 
1, 2, and 3 years post-TQD based on the smoking-specific and general 
characteristics of their social networks (ie, social network indicators).
Using LCA, models with two to nine classes were preliminarily 
considered at each wave to provide guidance during model selection 
with LTA. Using LTA, models with two to nine classes were consid-
ered to determine whether subgroups of participants with unique 
types of social networks could be identified across 1, 2, and 3 years 
post-TQD. Model selection was based on the Akaike information 
criterion (AIC39) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC40), as well 
as model stability and interpretability.
Three sets of parameters were of interest: item-response prob-
abilities that represent the probabilities of providing particular 
responses to particular items conditional on latent class member-
ship, and that provide the foundation for interpreting the latent 
classes; latent class membership probabilities that represent the sizes 
of the latent classes at each wave; and transition probabilities that 
represent the probabilities of transitioning to classes at wave t + 1 
conditional on membership in a particular latent class at wave t. 
PROC LCA and PROC LTA41 were used to estimate these models; 
maximum likelihood estimate identification was confirmed for all 
models using 200 sets of random starting values.
Third, we used our selected LTA to examine change over time in 
social network class membership from 1 to 2 years post-TQD and 
2 to 3 years post-TQD. Fourth, we added covariates to our selected 
LTA to test whether demographic characteristics, baseline social net-
work size, baseline cigarettes per day, and treatment status predicted 
class membership at 1 year post-TQD and whether smoking absti-
nence predicted transitions between classes from 1 to 2 years post-
TQD and 2 to 3 years post-TQD. Continuous predictors (ie, age, 
network size, cigarettes per day) were standardized as suggested by 
Lanza, Collins, Lemmon, and Schafer.42
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics for the indicators used to identify smokers’ 
social network classes appear in Table 1. There was a high degree 
of similarity in response distributions across years post-TQD. For 
example, 81%–82% of participants reported that at least two mem-
bers of their social networks were never-smokers at 1, 2, and 3 years 
post-TQD. However, there were changes in participants’ network 
members during that time—70%–73% of participants reported 
that at least two members were new to their networks since the 
last assessment. Interestingly, some of the indicators were endorsed 
relatively infrequently; for example, across all assessments, less than 
10% of participants reported that they had a smoking buddy in their 
networks and only about 20% had a romantic partner who smoked 
daily.
Identification and Description of Social 
Network Types
Individual LCAs for 1, 2, and 3 years post-TQD suggested that five 
classes optimally explained the heterogeneity in smokers’ social net-
work characteristics (results available upon request). Using these 
preliminary results as a guide, LTAs across 1–3 years post-TQD with 
two to nine latent classes were compared to confirm selection of the 
five-class model; final model selection was conducted with LTA due 
to increased power to detect latent classes. Model selection informa-
tion is presented in Table 2. Minimum AIC and BIC values indicate 
an optimal balance of model fit and parsimony.37 The BIC was mini-
mized for the five-class model and, although there was not a clear 
minimum value, the AIC suggested a low level of information loss by 
selecting the five-class model over the six-class model.
Parameter estimates for the five-class model appear in Table 3 
(note that item-response probabilities were restricted to be equal 
across 1–3 years post-TQD to keep the interpretation of the latent 
classes the same over time). The first class, labeled Immersed  
(9%–11% prevalence), was characterized by members’ social 
networks being likely to be large in size (item-response probabil-
ity = .63), to have new members (.81), and to include both daily (.90) 
and never-smokers (.79), with participants likely to smoke around 
network members (.77) and vice versa (.78). Further, Immersed 
participants were the only ones who were likely to have a smok-
ing buddy group (1.00), with those buddies likely to be present in 
their networks (.62). Notably, their partners tended not to be daily 
smokers (.27). Class 2, labeled Low Smoking Exposure (23%–26% 
prevalence), also had large networks with new members, but was 
distinguished from the Immersed class by a lack of the following: 
daily smokers in their networks, exposure to smoking, smoking with 
network members, a smoker buddy group, or a partner who smoked 
daily. Across all of the classes identified, Immersed and Low Smoking 
Exposure illustrate the extremes in smokers’ social environments.
The other three identified classes, labeled Smoking Partner 
(9%–11% prevalence), Isolated (22%–27%), and Distant Smoking 
Exposure (29%–32%), were characterized by particular aspects 
of smoking exposure and/or network size. The Smoking Partner 
class was characterized by limited exposure to smoking and smaller 
social networks. They were unique in their high likelihood of having

romantic partners who were daily smokers. The Isolated class was 
characterized by smaller social networks without exposure to smok-
ing from any source, and members of this class were least likely to 
report new network members. The Distant Smoking Exposure class 
was characterized by the types of members (new members, daily and 
never-smokers) reported by the Immersed class, but members of the 
Distant Smoking Exposure class reported a relative lack of close or 
intimate smoking exposure via smoking buddies or romantic partners.
In summary, the Immersed class represents smokers with exten-
sive exposure to smoking via all routes except via the romantic 
partner; the Low Smoking Exposure class represents smokers with 
relatively large networks that comprise few smokers and little smok-
ing exposure; the Smoking Partner class represents smokers who are 
exposed to smoking via a romantic partner but who have little other 
network exposure to smoking; the Isolated class represents smok-
ers who have relatively small and unchanging networks and little 
network exposure to smoking; and the Distant Smoking Exposure 
class represents smokers who have smokers in their network but not 
smoking buddies or a romantic partner who smokes.
Transitions Between Social Network Classes
Transition probabilities representing transitions between classes 1–2 
and 2–3 years post-TQD appear in Table 3. These probabilities are 
interpreted as the likelihood of membership in a network class at 
wave t + 1 (columns) conditional on membership in a network class 
at wave t (rows). Shaded values represent the “stability” param-
eters—the probabilities of membership in the same class at adja-
cent timepoints, whereas other values represent the probabilities 
of changing memberships. For example, 44% of Immersed partici-
pants at 1 year post-TQD were members of the Immersed class at 
2 years post-TQD, whereas 9% of them had transitioned to Low 
Smoking Exposure, 2% to Smoking Partner, 7% to Isolated, and 
37% to Distant Smoking Exposure. From 1 to 2 years post-TQD, 
Immersed participants were most likely to transition to a different 
social network class (a total of 56%) and Low Smoking Exposure 
participants were least likely to transition (20%). For participants 
who were members of the two classes with the most movement, 
Immersed and Isolated, those who transitioned were most likely to 
transition to Distant Smoking Exposure. Transitions for 2–3 years 
post-TQD showed a similar pattern.

Table 4. Effects are reported as odds ratios expressing the change in 
odds of membership in all other classes compared to a reference class, 
for a one-unit increase in the predictor. Low Smoking Exposure was 
used as the reference class because it was thought to represent a class 
at comparatively low risk for smoking relapse. In comparison to Low 
Smoking Exposure, members of the other classes differed in their 
mean ages and baseline network size (ps < .05). In comparison to 
Low Smoking Exposure, members of the Immersed, Smoking Partner, 
Isolated, and Distant Smoking Exposure classes were younger and 
had smaller networks at baseline. For example, the odds of mem-
bership in the Immersed class compared to membership in the Low 
Smoking Exposure class decreased by a factor of .55 for every one SD 
increase in age (mean age of sample = 45.79 [SD = 10.64], providing 
a sense of scale for these differences). Class membership at 1 year 
post-TQD did not differ significantly by gender, race, baseline ciga-
rettes per day, or treatment status (see Table 4).
Effects on Transitions for Years 1–2 and 2–3 Post-TQD
Estimates for the prospective effects of biochemically assessed 
smoking abstinence on transitions between classes 1–2 and 
2–3 years post-TQD are shown in Table 5; effect estimates were 
made in reference to staying in the same class between assessments. 
As noted earlier, compared to members of other classes, partici-
pants in the Immersed class were more likely to transition to other 
social network classes over time; due to larger transition prob-
abilities, effects were more reliably estimated for these transitions. 
Abstinence was strongly related to transitions from the Immersed 
class. For example, among participants who were members of the 
Immersed class at 1 year post-TQD, those who were abstinent were 
8.63 times more likely to transition to Distant Smoking Exposure 
rather than staying Immersed, compared to those who were not 
abstinent at 1 year post-TQD. In comparison, abstinence was asso-
ciated with lower odds of all other transitions 1–2 years post-TQD 
for Immersed participants. The pattern of odds ratios for 2–3 years 
post-TQD had one difference: abstinence was associated with 
higher odds of transitioning to either Low Smoking Exposure or 
Distant Smoking Exposure among individuals who were Immersed 
at 2 years post-TQD.
As noted earlier, the most common transition endpoint was Distant 
Smoking Exposure; transitions into this class were highly related to

smoking and smoking abstinence. For example, among members of 
the Isolated class at 1 year post-TQD, the odds of membership in the 
Distant Smoking Exposure class 2 years post-TQD compared to mem-
bership in the Isolated class decreased by a factor of .33 for those who 
were abstinent compared to those who smoked. Abstinence was also 
strongly related to transitions into the Low Smoking Exposure class. 
For example, abstinent members of the Distant Smoking Exposure 
class at 1 year post-TQD were 34.35 times more likely to transition 
to the Low Smoking Exposure class versus not transitioning at 2 years 
post-TQD, compared to smoking members of that class. (Note that 
the large size of this odds ratio is likely due to small sample sizes 
in the latent contingency table among abstinence, Distant Smoking 
Exposure latent class membership, and Low Smoking Exposure latent 
class membership.) Also, abstinent members of the Isolated class at 
2 years post-TQD were 6.83 times more likely to transition to Low 
Smoking Exposure versus not transitioning at 3 years post-TQD, com-
pared to smoking members of that class.
Discussion
The current research identified social network classes based on 
smoking-relevant characteristics and described how membership 
in these classes changed over time depending on whether smokers 
became abstinent or continued smoking. This research identified 
five latent classes of social networks that could be distinguished on 
the dimensions of size and amount of contact with smokers within 
the network. Participants were fairly evenly distributed across the 
latent classes (ie, networks types). Interestingly, the most prevalent 
network classes across all assessments (Low Smoking Exposure, 
Isolated, Distant Smoking Exposure) were those with relatively lit-
tle intimate contact with smokers (ie, no smoking buddies or smok-
ing partners), whereas the two least prevalent classes (Immersed, 
Smoking Partner) were the ones characterized by this intimate 
exposure. This finding may suggest that smokers in intimate rela-
tionships with other smokers may be less likely to attempt to quit 
and, therefore, less likely to be present in this sample.12,14 Further, 
in three of the classes (Low Smoking Exposure, Smoking Partner, 
Isolated) participants reported at most one daily smoker in their 
social networks. Such modest representation of smokers in the 
classes may reflect the decreasing smoking prevalence in the United 
States.43 Alternatively, it could represent attempts by smokers seek-
ing cessation treatment to limit their exposure to smoking.
As seen in previous research,13,21,44 smokers with limited expo-
sure to other smokers (ie, those in the Low Smoking Exposure class) 
had the highest abstinence rates over time (53%–59%). Further, 
participants in this class were significantly older than those in other 
classes. It may be that Low Smoking Exposure class membership is 
related to a relatively developed network with more mature mem-
bers who are less likely to smoke. Both age and reduced exposure 
to other smokers are associated with cessation success and reduced 
relapse risk.45,46
The Immersed (7%–9%) and Smoking Partner (25%–29%) 
classes had the lowest abstinence rates over time. This illustrates that 
either multiple sources of smoking exposure, in the former, or a single, 
intimate exposure source, in the latter, may discourage abstinence. The 
elevated risk of continued smoking among members of the Smoking 
Partner class is consistent with other research showing that having a 
partner who smokes can undercut cessation success.10,14,47 Such find-
ings underscore the importance of interventions that address part-
ner smoking. Of course, having networks that involve high levels of 
smoking exposure may be correlated with other factors (eg, alcohol 
use, lower educational status) that may instead account for observed 
relations between class membership and smoking outcomes.
After establishing the social network classes, LTA was used 
to examine how classes changed as a result of smoking status. 
Abstinence predicted transitions from the Isolated to the Low 
Smoking Exposure and Distant Exposure Smoking classes, repre-
senting a shift to larger social networks. Although the Low Smoking 
Exposure and Distant Exposure Smoking classes had bigger net-
works, addressing potential social isolation, they also had at least 
one daily smoker whereas Isolated networks did not. This shift con-
flicts with studies of adolescents’ friendship selection, in which low 
smokers tended to befriend other low smokers.5
Another key set of transitions involved the Immersed class, 
which was characterized by the highest levels of smoking exposure 
from multiple sources and by especially heavy smoking. This was 
the most dynamic class; over half of its members transitioned out 
between assessments. At both 1 and 2 years post-TQD, abstinence 
predicted movement out of the Immersed class over the subsequent 
year. Immersed class participants most commonly transitioned to 
the Distant Smoking Exposure class, characterized by a lower likeli-
hood of “smoking buddies,” or to the Low Smoking Exposure class, 
characterized by a relative absence of daily smokers. This pattern 
could result from smokers (1) transitioning out of the Immersed 
class in preparation for quitting, (2) who quit successfully no longer 
smoking with network members, and/or (3) who quit successfully no 
longer maintaining social ties with smoking friends. Alternatively, it 
could reflect previous smoking friends dropping them from their net-
works.5 Finally, abstinent members of the Distant Smoking Exposure 
class at 1 year post-TQD were more likely than smoking members to 
transition to the Low Smoking Exposure class at 2 years post-TQD, 
representing a change to a larger network with less exposure to daily 
smoking. Overall, our findings suggest that abstinence is associated 
with shifts in participants’ social networks such that they shift to 
networks that are larger and that result in less contact with, and 
exposure to, smokers.
These findings may have important clinical implications. On 
the one hand, these findings may merely indicate that those who 
are successful at quitting smoking are more likely to transition to 
networks that entail less exposure to smoking. On the other hand, 
the results may also reflect the fact that exposure to smoking and 
smokers discourages abstinence. The latter mechanism is supported 
by considerable other research9,10 and supports further development 
of behavioral interventions designed to reduce exposure to smokers 
and smoking cues during quit attempts and to help smokers with 
small networks engage in new social activities that would allow 
them to befriend nonsmokers.34,48 In addition, counselors could use 
these results to reassure smokers that quitting tends to increase, not 
decrease, the size of social networks.
Limitations and Conclusion
There are several limitations to consider when interpreting the 
results of the current study. First, there were three factors that may 
limit generalizability: (1) the sample comprises those who were 
interested in making a quit attempt with a relatively intense ces-
sation treatment and may not be representative of smokers in gen-
eral; (2) data from fewer than half of the original participants were 
analyzed due to missing data on the predictors used in analyses; 
and (3) the social network data were based on self-report. Second, 
there was some overlap among the variables used as indicators,

Tobacco Research, 2016, Vol. 18, No. 12

 2250
predictors, and outcomes. For instance, latent classes were identi-
fied using an indicator of participants’ reports of smoking with net-
work members. Thus, successfully quitting smoking would affect 
membership in classes partially defined by smoking with network 
members. However, most of our indicators did not overlap to 
this extent. Third, only dichotomous indicators were used in the 
models. Models with mixed dichotomous and continuous indica-
tors can be difficult to estimate and interpret. Therefore, we used 
only dichotomous variables to facilitate interpretation. Fourth, we 
focused on smoking exposure and did not use other potentially 
important variables to define social networks (eg, amount of social 
support for quitting, interpersonal stress). Future research is needed 
to examine a broader range of variables that may help characterize 
smokers’ social networks over time. Fifth, LCA and LTA provide a 
way to understand the heterogeneity in smokers’ social networks, 
but the nature of the classes may be affected by diverse factors (eg, 
the nature of the sample). Therefore, it is important not to reify 
these classes. Finally, the causal directions of the relations cannot 
be ascribed with certainty. For instance, smoking exposure in the 
Immersed class may thwart quitting, or it may be that those who do 
not quit successfully do not change their networks. Future research 
is needed to disentangle these relations.
In conclusion, this study provides new insight into the relations 
between smoking and social networks. Prior research has shown that 
features of adult smokers’ social milieu may affect the likelihood 
of future smoking cessation.9,10 The current study identifies the fea-
tures of social networks that occur among adult smokers, and how 
quitting smoking is related to change in such networks. Specifically, 
social networks defined by the highest levels of smoking and expo-
sure to smokers were also most highly associated with continued 
smoking. Moreover, when smokers quit smoking they tended to 
enter networks that were larger, contained fewer smokers, and that 
involved fewer close relations with smokers.
