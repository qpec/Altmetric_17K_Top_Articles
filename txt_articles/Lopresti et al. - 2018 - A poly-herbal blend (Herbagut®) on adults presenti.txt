Abstract
Background: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a poly-herbal formulation, Herbagut, for the treatment of
gastrointestinal symptoms and its effect on quality of life parameters in patients presenting with self-reported,
unsatisfactory bowel habits.
Methods: This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Fifty adults with self-reported unsatisfactory
bowel habits, primarily characterised by chronic constipation were randomly allocated to take Herbagut or a matching
placebo for 28 days. Efficacy of gastrointestinal changes was measured by the completion of a patient daily diary
evaluating changes in stool type (Bristol Stool Form Scale), ease of bowel movements, and feeling of complete
evacuation; and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). Changes in quality of life were also examined using
the World Health Organization Quality of Life – abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Patient Assessment of
Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL).
Results: All participants completed the 28-day trial with no adverse events reported. Compared to the placebo, weekly
bowel movements increased over time (p < .001), as did self-reported, normal bowel motions (76% vs 4%; p < .001).
Self-reported incomplete evacuation was also lower in the Herbagut group compared to placebo (24% vs 76%;
p = <.001). GSRS domain ratings for abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion, and reflux also decreased
significantly in people taking Herbagut compared to placebo (p < .001, for all domains). Moreover, quality of life
significantly improved in the Herbagut group compared to placebo as indicated by significantly greater improvement
in WHOQOL-BREF domain ratings for overall quality of life, social relations, environmental health, psychological health,
and physical health (p < .001, for all domains); and PAC-QOL domain ratings for physical discomfort, psychosocial
discomfort, worries and concerns, and life satisfaction (p < .001, for all domains). The changes were considered clinically
meaningful as evidenced by their large effect sizes.
Conclusion: Herbagut ingestion over a 28-day period resulted in improvements in several gastrointestinal symptoms
and overall quality of life. Further investigation utilising larger sample sizes and diverse clinical and cultural populations
are needed.

 Background
Functional
gastrointestinal
disorders
(FGIDs)
are
a
group of conditions with no identifiable structural or
biochemical abnormality. They are distinguished by a
range of symptoms including motility disturbance, vis-
ceral hypersensitivity, disturbed mucosal and immune
function, altered gut microbiota, and altered central ner-
vous system processing. Based on the Rome IV classifi-
cation system, there are 33 FGIDs in adults and 20
paediatric disorders, all of which are theorised to result
from disturbances in gut-brain interactions [1].
FGIDs are associated with a reduced quality of life,
characterised by impairments in social, mental, occupa-
tional, and physical function [2, 3]. Approximately 30%
of adults in primary care settings are believed to suffer
from depression, and between 30 to 50% have a comor-
bid anxiety disorder [4, 5]. People with FGIDs also have
an increased non-gastrointestinal (GI) medical burden
characterised by a greater number of non-GI diagnoses,
medical consultations, and pharmaceutical prescriptions
compared to GI symptom-free adults [6]. Chronic con-
stipation is particularly problematic as it is estimated to
affect up to 27% of the world’s population, with greater
prevalence in women and adults over the age of 65 years
[7]. Results from a US population-based cohort study
with over 30,000 person-years of follow-up confirmed
that chronic constipation was associated with poorer
survival rates over an approximate 20-year period [8].
Constipation is a symptom-based disorder based on
subjective patient descriptions. Consequently, there is
often a lack of agreement between physicians, patients,
and researchers regarding its defining characteristics.
However, this has been improved by the increased adop-
tion of the Rome diagnostic criteria. Based on the Rome
IV criteria, chronic constipation must include two or
more of the following: (a) straining during at least 25%
of defecations, (b) lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of
defecations, (c) sensation of incomplete evacuation for at
least 25% of defecations, (d) sensation of anorectal obstruc-
tion/blockage for at least 25% of defecations, (e) manual
manoeuvres to facilitate at least 25% of defecations (e.g.,
digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor), and (f) fewer
than three spontaneous defecations per week. In addition,
loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives,
and there are insufficient criteria to meet the diagnosis of
irritable bowel syndrome [9]. These symptoms must be
present for at least 6 months before the diagnosis and
should be present for at least the past 3 months.
Treatment options for constipation typically comprise
recommendations of increased fluid intake, greater con-
sumption of high-fibre-containing foods, increased phys-
ical activity, fibre supplementation, prescription of osmotic
or stimulant laxatives, and possible pelvic floor therapy
[10]. Identifying and modifying potential contributory or
causative influences are also recommended including a
review of medication use, psychiatric presentation,
endocrine and metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes melli-
tus, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, and chronic
renal failure), and neurological disorders (e.g., demen-
tia, Parkinson disease, neuropathies, multiple sclerosis,
and spinal cord injuries) [11–13].
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is
commonly used by adults with GI conditions. An inter-
view of over 13,000 US citizens with GI conditions con-
firmed that 42% used CAM in the past year (although
only 3% of respondents used CAM for the treatment of
GI issues), with herbs and supplements the most fre-
quently used CAM modality [14]. In another study, 44 %
of adults attending outpatient GI clinics also reported
using CAM therapies [15]. Given this high adoption, in-
vestigations into CAM therapies are essential to ensure
their safety and efficacy for individuals with GI disorders.
Natural plant compounds present as potential options
to restore GI health and reduce GI symptoms. For ex-
ample, there is mounting evidence from preclinical and
clinical evidence that many natural compounds have
anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory influences, re-
duce oxidative stress, modulate intracellular signalling
transduction pathways, and can alter gut microbiota [16].
Altering these molecular mechanisms can have beneficial
effects on GI function. Moreover, plant-derived natural
compounds also have the potential to lower visceral
hypersensitivity (a decreased threshold of stimuli percep-
tion generated from the GI tract), which is a common
problem in FGIDs such as irritable bowel syndrome [17].
Unpublished investigations into the GI effects of
Herbagut®
Herbagut® is a proprietary blend of 14 herbal extracts
(Tinospora cordifolia, Hemidesmus indicus, Piper longum
Linn, Alpinia galangal, Terminalia chebula Retz, Swertia
chirata Buch, Murraya koeniggii, Curcuma longa, and
Zingiber officinale) standardised with total polyphenols
of not less than 15% and designed to support GI func-
tion. An unpublished in vitro investigation (results in-
cluded in Additional file 1) demonstrated that Herbagut
exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli,
Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Lacto-
bacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Shi-
gella dysenteriae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Vibrio cholera, and
Helicobacter
pylori.
Lower
minimum
inhibitory
concentrations were demonstrated against the unfavour-
able bacteria, Streptococcus thermophiles, Shigella dys-
enteriae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Vibrio cholera. In an
unpublished animal study, the laxative effects of Herba-
gut was examined in rats. Constipation was induced by
the daily oral administration of loperamide hydrochlor-
ide (3 mg/kg) for six days. Treated rats were orally given
Lopresti et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2018) 18:98 
Page 2 of 13
 Herbagut (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg) once daily for 6 days,
after which time 24-h faecal matter was collected. The
animals were then sacrificed on day 7 and the number
of faecal pellets in the colonic lumen was counted and
their mean diameter measured. Herbagut administration
significantly alleviated loperamide-induced constipation,
as evidenced by an increase in 24-h faecal pellet number
and water content discharge, and a reduction in the
number and mean diameter of faecal pellets remaining
in the colonic lumen compared to control rats. Herbagut
at a dose of 75 mg/kg was found to be most effective.
Study aims
The objective of the present trial was to evaluate the effi-
cacy and tolerability of Herbagut in adults presenting with
self-reported unsatisfactory bowel habits. It was hypothe-
sised that its administration over a 4-week period would
positively influence several indicators associated with GI
function, GI disturbance, and overall quality of life.
Methods
Study design
This study was a 28-day, randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and toler-
ability of Herbagut on GI health and its effect on quality
of life parameters in adults with self-reported unsatisfac-
tory bowel habits, primarily characterised by chronic
constipation. The study protocol was approved by ‘Nagpur
Independent Ethics Committee’ and registered with the
Clinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI registration number:
CTRI/2016/11/007479) with participant recruitment oc-
curring between July 2015 to September 2015. Details of
the study design are outlined in Fig. 1.
An a priori power analysis was undertaken to estimate
required sample size. We predicted a moderate effect
size of 0.8 for the treatment group. Assuming a power of
80% and a type one error rate (alpha) of 5%, the total
number of participants to find an effect was estimated as
50. Enrolled participants were assigned to either one of
the two study groups (Herbagut or placebo) according
to a computer-generated randomisation sheet in a 1:1
ratio. A randomisation list with only the randomisation
numbers was provided to the study site for the purpose
of enrolling volunteers in the study. The master ran-
domisation list with the details of allocation was kept
safely and confidentially with the study sponsor.
Potential participants were screened after being provided
with details about the study (both verbally and in writing)
and signing an informed consent form. Fifty eligible partic-
ipants were enrolled in the study as per inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria. Participants attended 4 visits in total to
Samvedna Hospital, India, during the study period. During
visit 1 (day − 5 to − 1) informed consent documentation,
demographic data, medical history, physical and systemic

 examination, vital parameters including respiratory rate,
electrocardiography, chest x-ray, haematology, biochemis-
try, serology, and urine analysis were performed. In
addition, a pregnancy test was undertaken on female par-
ticipants. On visit 2 (day 0) eligible participants were en-
rolled into the trial and were randomised into one of two
treatment conditions (Herbagut or Placebo). Participants
were also asked to complete several self-report measures at
baseline, day 14, and day 28, comprising a daily bowel
habits diary, World Health Organization Quality of Life –
abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF), Gastrointestinal
Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), and Patient Assessment of
Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL). Participants were
also questioned about tolerability to capsule intake and ad-
verse events. During visit 4 (final visit) unused capsules
were also collected and recorded.
Participants
Patients visiting the Samvedna Hospital in India for a
gastroenterology consultation were recruited for this
study. Participants were informed about the study, and if
agreeable, were assessed by the gastroenterologist or
medical officer for eligibility for inclusion in the study.
Inclusion criteria
Healthy male and female adults aged between 18 to
65 years, a body mass index (BMI) between 20 and
30 kg/m2, with self-reported unsatisfactory bowel habits,
baseline Bristol Stool Form type 1–2, and GSRS ratings
of 2 or less on all questions were eligible for inclusion in
this study. Participants were willing to participate in
the study and comply with its procedures by signing
a written informed consent. Participants also met in-
clusion criteria if they reported no regular use of fibre
supplements the month prior to the screening visit.
Participants were willing to discontinue the intake of
probiotics, prebiotics, fermented milk products, yog-
hurt, or laxative use at least 4 weeks prior to, and
during the study period. Female participants of child-
bearing age were willing to use a reliable method of
contraception throughout the study period. Results of
a pregnancy test undertaken at screening also needed
to be negative.
Exclusion criteria
Participants were ineligible for the study if they were diag-
nosed with a gastrointestinal disease (e.g., irritable bowel
disorder, Crohn’s disease, Coeliac disease) or were assessed
as having severe gastrointestinal complications requiring
immediate medical intervention, had an allergy or intoler-
ance to lactose or any other food ingredient, regularly
consumed
probiotics,
fibre
supplements,
prebiotics,
yogurt, or laxatives. Participants were also excluded if any
clinically relevant abnormalities were found during initial
screening or there was a reported history of abdominal
surgery (including gastric bypass or laparoscopic banding).
Ongoing use of medications known to affect gut motility,
such as prokinetic agents, anti-emetic agents, anxiolytics,
antidepressants, narcotic analgesic agents, anticholinergic
agents for irritable bowel syndrome, medications for
constipation, 5HT3 antagonists, anti-diarrheal agents,
opiate agents used to treat diarrhoea, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, and antibiotics taken during
or within 4 weeks of study onset, were also included
as ineligibility criteria. People with co-morbid illnesses
such as alcohol and other drug dependence, cardio-
vascular, endocrine, renal, or other chronic disease,
were also excluded.
Interventions
400 mg capsules of Herbagut® (Arjuna Natural Extracts
Ltd., Aluva, Kerala, India) and matching placebo (roasted
rice powder) were used for the intervention and placebo
groups, respectively. Participants were instructed to take
two capsules, 1-h before bedtime with 250 ml of water.
The herbal drug and placebo (roasted rice powder) was
filled in ‘0’ size green coloured opaque hard capsules. This
prevented bias based on smell, taste and appearance be-
tween the herbal drug and placebo. The herbal drug and
placebo capsules for each participants was also dispensed
in sealed bottles which will also helped maintain blinding.
Details of study drug
Herbagut® is a proprietary blend of 14 herbal extracts con-
taining Tinospora cordifolia stem (Guduchi or Amrita),
Hemidesmus indicus rhizomes (Indian Sarsaparilla), Piper
longum Linn fruit (Indian Long Pepper), Alpinia galangal
rhizomes (Thai Ginger), Terminalia chebula Retz fruit
(Black- or Chebulic Myrobalan), Andrographis panilulata
dried stem and leaves (Swertia chirata Buch), Murraya
koeniggii leaves (Curry Tree), Curcuma longa rhizome
(Turmeric) and Zingiber officinale rhizome (Ginger). The
ingredients in Herbagut® are blended in equal ratios stan-
dardised with total polyphenols of not less than 15% by
spectrophotometer, total curcuminoids not less than 6%
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and
total gingerols not less than 0.4% by HPLC.
Outcome measures
Patient daily diary
Participants completed daily monitoring of the following
bowel habits:
1. Consistency of bowel movement – this was assessed
using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS). The BSFS
is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the
form of human faeces into seven categories. Type 1
and 2 typifies constipation, type 3 and 4 ideal stools
Lopresti et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2018) 18:98 
Page 4 of 13
 (4 is better), type 5 typifies a precursor to diarrhoea,
and types 6 and 7 diarrhoea [18].
2. Ease of bowel movement – this was ascertained from
a response to one of six options (manual disimpaction,
enema needed, straining needed, normal, urgent
without pain, and urgent with pain). Participants were
required to choose a single response that best fit their
bowel movement characteristics.
3. Evacuation – this was ascertained from a yes or no
response to the question, “Did you feel like you
emptied your bowels completely?”.
Baseline scores for the Patient Daily Diary were based on
ratings made at day 0. However, scores for days 14 and 28
were based on average ratings over the previous 14 days.
Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS)
The GSRS is a self-report scale that covers 15 gastro-
intestinal symptoms rated on a 4-point Likert scale, de-
pending on the level of troublesome symptoms over the
previous week. Ratings range from 0 (no symptoms) to 3
(severe, incapacitating with inability to perform normal
activities). Five subscale scores are calculated for the do-
mains comprising abdominal pain, constipation, diar-
rhoea, indigestion, and reflux. The GSRS has been shown
to have good psychometric properties [19].
World Health Organization quality of life – Abbreviated
version (WHOQOL-BREF)
WHOQOL-BREF (an abbreviated version of the WHO
QOL-100) contains a total of 26 questions, rated on a 5-
point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always) [20]. The
WHOQOL-BREF assesses four domains of quality of life
comprising physical health (mobility, daily activities,
functional capacity, energy, pain, and sleep); psycho-
logical health (self-image, negative thoughts, positive at-
titudes, self-esteem, mentality, learning ability, memory,
concentration, religion, and mental status); social rela-
tionships (personal relationships, social support, and sex
life); and environmental health (financial resources,
safety, health and social services, living environment, op-
portunities to acquire new skills and knowledge, recre-
ation, general environment, and transportation), with
higher scores indicating better quality of life. The
WHOQOL-BREF has demonstrated good psychometric
properties [21].
Patient assessment of constipation-quality of life (PAC-QOL)
PAC-QOL is a self-report questionnaire that measures
the quality of life of people with constipation. Twenty-
eight questions are rated using a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from 0 (nothing/ never) to 4 (extremely/ always)
with lower scores reflecting better quality of life. Four sub-
scale scores are generated comprising physical discomfort,
psychosocial discomfort, worries and concerns, and satis-
faction. The PAC-QOL has demonstrated adequate reli-
ability and validity [22].
Statistical analysis
An independent samples T-test was used to compare
demographic and baseline variables across the treatment
groups for continuous variables, and Pearson’s Chi-square
was used to compare categorical data. The Shapiro-Wilk
normality test was conducted to examine normality of
within-group data over time. This confirmed that data
was not normally distributed, thereby making parametric
testing inappropriate (transformations did not normalise
data). As a result, within-group changes were analysed
using non-parametric tests, comprising either the Wil-
coxon signed rank test, Mann-Whitney U-test, or Fisher’s
exact test for count data. Between-group differences at dif-
fering time points were evaluated with the independent
samples Mann-Whitney U-Test. Effect sizes (ES) were
calculated for the Mann-Whitney U-test based on the
formula, Z2 ÷ N-1 (0.1 = small ES, 0.3 = medium ES; 0.5 =
large ES). For all the tests, statistical significance was set at
P < .05 (two-tailed). All data were analysed using SPSS
(version 22; IBM, Armonk, NY).
Results
Demographic details and baseline data
A total of 50 participants (29 males and 21 females) were
enrolled in the study with all volunteers completing the 28-
day trial. Data was also collected in full, with no missing
data from assessment instruments. Demographic character-
istics are shown in Table 1 and indicate that the study
population was largely homogeneous, with no statistically
significant differences between the groups on demographic
characteristics. However, there were statistically significant
between-group differences at baseline for WHOQOL-BREF
overall quality ratings and baseline PAC-QOL values for
physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort and worries/
concerns (lower scores in the placebo condition).
Patient daily diary
Table 2 details findings from the Patient Daily Diary. In
the Herbagut group, weekly bowel movements increased
over time (p < .001). At baseline, only 12% of participants
reported ≥3 bowel movements a week which increased
at the end of treatment to 72%. In contrast, there was no
change in frequency of bowel movements in participants
in the placebo group (p = .414).
An analysis of change in stool type over time, as mea-
sured by the BSFS indicated positive stool changes in
both the Herbagut and placebo groups. At baseline, no
participants reported ideal stool forms (i.e., type 3 and 4)
in the Herbagut group, which increased to 44% at day
28. Positive stool changes also occurred in the placebo
Lopresti et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2018) 18:98 
Page 5 of 13
 group, where rates of healthy stools moved from 0% at
baseline to 32% at day 28. A Fisher’s exact test for count
data demonstrated significant differences in the fre-
quency of constipation (type 1 and 2) at day 28 between
the placebo and Herbagut groups, with lower frequen-
cies in the Herbagut group (p = .040). Ease of bowel mo-
tions also increased significantly in the Herbagut group,
with no participants reporting normal bowel movements
at baseline, and 76% at the end of treatment. No change
in bowel movements occurred in the placebo group with
4% at baseline and end of treatment reporting normal
bowel movements. A Fisher’s exact test for count data
demonstrated significant differences in self-reported ease
of bowel movement at day 28 between the placebo and
Herbagut groups, with greater frequency of normal
bowel movements in the Herbagut group (p < .001) Fi-
nally, self-reported incomplete evacuation decreased sig-
nificantly in the Herbagut group, with rates decreasing
from 84% to 24%, from baseline to treatment comple-
tion, respectfully. No significant reductions occurred in
the placebo group as rates of incomplete evacuation
were 92% at baseline and 76% at day 28. A Fisher’s exact
test for count data demonstrated significant differences
in the frequency of complete evacuations at day 28 be-
tween the placebo and Herbagut groups, with greater
frequencies in the Herbagut group (p = <.001).
GSRS
Results from the GSRS domain ratings over time are
presented in Fig. 2. As indicated, ratings for abdominal
pain, constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion, and reflux de-
creased significantly in people taking Herbagut. Abdom-
inal pain ratings decreased by 70%, constipation by 49%,
diarrhoea by 45%, indigestion by 64%, and reflux by 72%.
However, no significant changes in these corresponding
domains were found in people taking the placebo. A

 Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that GSRS ratings
on all domains decreased significantly from baseline to
day 28 in the Herbagut group (p < .001, for all domains).
However, there were no statistically significant changes
in the placebo group. As demonstrated in Table 3, an in-
dependent samples Mann-Whitney U Test confirmed
statistically significant, and large between-group differ-
ences on all domain scores at day 28.

Ratings
for
the

domains
measured
by
the
WHOQOL-BREF are detailed in Fig. 3. In the Herbagut
group, significant rating changes were demonstrated
across all domains as measured by an increase of 82% in
overall quality of life, 40% in social relations, 92% in en-
vironmental health, 94% in psychological health, and
80% in physical health domain ratings. There were non-
significant changes in the placebo demonstrated by re-
ductions from 3 to 5% over time in the aforementioned
domains. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that
WHOQOL-BREF ratings on all domains decreased sig-
nificantly from baseline to day 28 in the Herbagut group
(p < .001, for all domains). However, there were no sta-
tistically significant changes in the placebo group. As
demonstrated
in

measures except social relationships where the effect
size was medium.
Pac-QOL
Results from the PAC-QOL domain scores are presented
in Fig. 4. As indicated, ratings for physical discomfort,
psychosocial discomfort, worries and concerns, and dis-
satisfaction significantly improved over time in people
taking Herbagut. The satisfaction scales were reversed
for ease of interpretation indicating low scores as im-
provements in satisfaction.
Physical discomfort ratings decreased by 66%, psycho-
social discomfort by 72%, and worries and concerns by
70%, while satisfaction scores improved by 64%. However,
no statistically significant changes in these corresponding
domains were found in people taking a placebo (ratings
varied from 0 to 11%). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test con-
firmed that PAC-QOL ratings on all domains decreased
significantly from baseline to day 28 in the Herbagut
group (p < .001, for all domains). However, there were
no
statistically
significant
changes
in
the
placebo
group. As demonstrated in Table 3, an independent
samples Mann-Whitney U Test confirmed statistically
significant and large between-group differences on all
domain scores at day 28.
Adverse events & treatment compliance
Participants were questioned about drug tolerability and
adverse events at days 14 and 28. Herbagut was demon-
strated to be well-tolerated with no significant adverse
events reported by participants. Tolerability of capsule
administration was further confirmed by the ability and
willingness of all participants to complete the 28-day
trial. Compliance with capsule intake was also high with
all participants consuming > 90% of allocated capsules
(as measured by returned capsule count at day 28).

 Discussion
Findings from this study support the efficacy of Herbagut
for the treatment of digestive symptoms and enhancement
of overall quality of life in adults with self-reported unsat-
isfactory bowel habits, suffering primarily from chronic
constipation. In this 28-day study, Herbagut was found to
be significantly more effective than a placebo as evidenced
by improvements in several measures. The GSRS, a self-
report measure of digestive symptoms confirmed positive
improvements in abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea,
indigestion, and reflux. Improvements in stool form, as
measured by the BSFS, provides additional support for the
digestive-enhancing efficacy of Herbagut, as ideal stool
forms increased from 24% of participants at baseline to
56% at the end of treatment. Moreover, the frequency of
bowel motions increased in participants taking Herbagut,
with 12% of participants reporting ≥3 motions per week at
baseline, and 76% of participants at the end of treatment.
Finally, self-reported incomplete evacuation decreased in
the Herbagut group, with rates decreasing from 84% pre-
treatment to 24% post-intervention. No such improve-
ments occurred in participants placed on placebo.
An examination of changes in quality of life also con-
firmed that Herbagut intake is associated with significant
and clinically meaningful positive improvements in a
range of mood, physical, and social domains. As mea-
sured by the WHOQOL-BREF, Herbagut was associated
with increased ratings of 82% in overall quality of life,
40% in social relations, 92% in environmental health,
94% in psychological health, and 80% in physical health
domains. Similar findings were demonstrated with the
PAC-QOL, where ratings for physical discomfort de-
creased by 66%, psychosocial discomfort by 72%, and
worries and concerns by 70%. Life satisfaction ratings
also improved by 64%. Although there were significant
baseline differences between the two conditions on the
PAC-QOL, the large effect sizes demonstrated in this
study adds to the clinical significance and validity of
study findings. Herbagut was also well-tolerated with no
significant adverse effects reported by participants.

 The mechanisms behind the efficacy of Herbagut re-
main uncertain although several possibilities are specu-
lated. Unpublished in vitro investigations into Herbagut
have indicated that it exhibits antibacterial activity against
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi-
murium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermo-
philus, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Vibrio
cholera, and Helicobacter pylori. Lower minimum inhibi-
tory concentrations were demonstrated against the un-
favourable bacteria Streptococcus thermophiles, Shigella
dysenteriae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Vibrio cholera. More-
over, several in vitro, animal and human studies have con-
firmed GI benefits from individual ingredients contained
in Herbagut. For example, Curcuma longa (Turmeric) has
been shown to support gastrointestinal function [23], re-
duce intestinal inflammation [24], and modify the gut
microbiome [25]. Zingiber officinale (Ginger) has antibac-
terial [26], anti-nausea [27], and motility-enhancing effects
[28], while Piper longum has confirmed antimicrobial and
gastro-protective effects [29]. Moreover, Tinospora cordifo-
lia contains the digestive enzymes amylase, maltase, and
isomaltase [30], and treatment with a formulation contain-
ing Tinospora cordifolia was shown to have anti-ulcer activ-
ity and reduced ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in
rats [31]. In vitro investigations have also confirmed Mur-
raya koeniggii [32] and Swertia chirata [33] to have anti-
microbial and antibacterial effects. The anti-inflammatory
influences from many of these ingredients and evidence
suggesting prebiotic-like activities of polyphenols on micro-
biota [34] may also contribute to the positive GI effects
from Herbagut.
Directions for future research
Findings from this study have confirmed that Herbagut
has positive effects on digestive health in adults present-
ing primarily with symptoms of chronic constipation.
However, its efficacy in adults presenting with other FGIDs
and GI disorders remains uncertain. Further investigation
is therefore essential to determine if Herbagut’s benefits ex-
tend to other GI conditions. Medication-induced adverse
GI effects is also a commonly encountered problem [35],
and an investigation into the efficacy of Herbagut to ameli-
orate such symptoms may also be fruitful. This is particu-
larly important as medication compliance can be a
problem for people experiencing drug-induced GI distur-
bances [36]. However, before this can be undertaken, the
potential interaction of Herbagut with such medications
requires consideration.
GI disturbances are commonly associated with a range
of other disorders. These include psychiatric disorders
[37], neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease
[38] and Parkinson’s disease [39], metabolic disorders
[40], and several dermatological conditions [41, 42].
Interest in the gut-brain interaction and the potential
implications on psychiatric and neurological function is
attracting increasing scientific and clinical attention.
This is specifically indicated by increasing investigations
into, and popularity of, probiotics. In recent meta-
analyses, it has been confirmed that probiotics have
some therapeutic benefit for the treatment of depression
[43, 44]. Herbagut, with its poly-herbal formulation, may
be a potential option to enhance both GI and mental
function in people suffering from psychiatric conditions.

 The positive change in the quality of life from the intake
of Herbagut, and recent research confirming antidepres-
sant benefits of curcumin [45], one ingredient contained
in Herbagut, adds weight to the therapeutic possibility of
Herbagut in this area. Herbagut also has the potential to
influence imbalances in bacterial ecology and parasitic in-
fection, and this could be another area of investigation.
Study limitations
Although findings from the study were positive, there
are several study design limitations. As already dis-
cussed, the efficacy of Herbagut was examined in a
population presenting with chronic constipation and no
formal GI diagnosis. This limits the generalisability of
findings to other populations presenting with divergent
GI symptoms. Diagnoses of FSIDs based on Rome classi-
fications will provide greater assessment of the efficacy
of Herbagut in more well-defined GI conditions. Partici-
pants for this study were only recruited from India,
where the intake of many of the herbs and ingredients
used in Herbagut may be more commonplace. Its toler-
ability and efficacy in other populations and cultures,
therefore,
requires
further
investigation.
Moreover,
Herbagut was only used for a comparatively short period
of 28-days, and the sample size recruited in this study
was also relatively small. It is, therefore, important that
future studies be conducted over a longer duration,
using larger sample sizes.
Although considered a generally valid indicator of
change, only subjective assessments were used in this
study to examine symptomatic changes over time. How-
ever, some difficulties were encountered with the use of
the selected self-report instruments. For example, to as-
sess ease of self-reported bowel movements, participants
were required to choose only one response from the
available options. This resulted in approximately 40% of
respondents describing problems of manual disimpac-
tion at baseline. This is a high number and may be
skewed as respondents were only permitted one re-
sponse. A similar difficulty was encountered with the
GSRS where participants were required to answer all
questions. However, based on anecdotal reports, rating
options for some questions were unsuitable, particularly
those assessing stool consistency. For example, on one
question the options ranged from ‘normal consistency to
watery stools.’ This seemed to artificially raise scores in
the diarrhoea domain despite most participants predom-
inantly suffering from constipation. The choice and de-
sign of subjective assessments to help assess baseline
characteristics and change over time will require careful
consideration in future studies. This could be partly
overcome by including objective measures of GI health
in the future to validate subjective changes. These could
include stool examinations of microbial ecology or blood
collections to measure inflammatory and other pertinent
measures of change. Moreover, because only recordings
over a single day was used to form baseline data (rather
than the typical 1 to 2 weeks of data) this limits it reli-
ability. In future studies, baseline information collected
over a longer period would be preferable.
Finally, the effects of Herbagut, a blend of multiple in-
gredients on GI symptoms was investigated. This makes
it impossible to determine the unique influences of each
individual ingredient on GI symptoms and overall qual-
ity of life. Although there is research to support the GI-
supporting efficacy of most individual components in
Herbagut, their exclusive effects on symptomatic change
were not specifically investigated in our study. Future
animal or in vitro studies analysing each ingredient in
isolation may help us to better understand the health-
enhancing role of each component.
Conclusions
The findings from this study provide preliminary sup-
port for the digestive-enhancing effects of Herbagut in
adults with self-reported unsatisfactory bowel habits, pri-
marily comprised of chronic constipation. Herbagut in-
gestion over a 28-day period resulted in improvements
in several GI symptoms and overall quality of life. Fur-
ther investigation into this promising poly-herbal blend
utilising larger sample sizes and diverse clinical and cul-
tural populations will help us to better understand its
health-enhancing efficacy.
