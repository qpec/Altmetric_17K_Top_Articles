Live attenuated vaccines are generally highly efficacious and often superior to inactivated 
30 
vaccines, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here we identify innate 
31 
immune recognition of microbial viability as a potent stimulus for T follicular helper (TFH) 
32 
cell differentiation and vaccine responses. Antigen presenting cells (APC) distinguish viable 
33 
from dead bacteria through the detection of bacterial RNA via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-8. 
34 
Live bacteria, bacterial RNA, or synthetic TLR8 agonists induce a specific cytokine profile 
35 
in human and porcine APC and promote TFH cell differentiation, which dead bacteria and 
36 
other TLR ligands fail to induce. Accordingly, vaccination with live, but not heat killed 
37 
attenuated bacteria induces TFH cell differentiation and robust humoral immune responses 
38 
in swine. A hypermorphic TLR8 polymorphism was associated with enhanced protective 
39 
immunity elicited by a live bacterial vaccine against tuberculosis in a human cohort. We 
40 
provide mechanistic insights into the superiority of live vaccines and we identify TLR8 as a 
41 
key regulator of TFH cell differentiation and a promising target for TFH-skewing adjuvants.

INTRODUCTION 
45 
Live attenuated microbes represent the first generation of vaccines and have contributed to the 
46 
extinction or dramatic reduction of deadly diseases such as smallpox or rabies1, 2, 3. Their 
47 
unparalleled success was based on empiricism4. Yet, their exact mechanisms of action, the 
48 
frequently observed superiority over inactivated vaccine preparations5, 6, and their exceptional 
49 
capacity to induce protective, often lifelong immunity still remain largely unexplained. 
50 
As the first line of defense, the innate immune system detects microbial invaders and 
51 
carefully scales the level of infectious threat in order to elicit appropriate, well-measured immune 
52 
responses7. We have previously described an inherent capacity of murine innate immune cells to 
53 
discriminate live from dead microorganisms8. Viable and thus potentially harmful microorganisms 
54 
contain specialized pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) as molecular signatures of 
55 
microbial life, which we termed vita-PAMPs8. We identified bacterial messenger RNA as a vita-
56 
PAMP, detection of which alerts the innate immune system, elicits specific inflammatory immune 
57 
responses, and promotes humoral immunity in mice8. However, the role of vita-PAMPs and their 
58 
receptors in regulating human immune responses is unknown. 
59 
Given the importance of innate immune signals in shaping adaptive immune responses9, 
60 
we asked whether innate immune recognition of bacterial viability affects ensuing T helper cell 
61 
responses and particularly the differentiation of T follicular helper (TFH) cells. Since their 
62 
identification10, 11, this subset of CD4+ T cells has progressively emerged as a pivotal regulator of 
63 
the germinal center response and humoral immunity12, 13, 14. Differentiation of TFH cells constitutes 
64 
a complex, multilayered process involving the combination of several molecular and cellular 
65 
signals at distinct microanatomical sites12, 13, 14. Intense research in recent years has unraveled the 
66 
complexity of TFH cell development, their transcriptional control14, 15, 16, 17, and their molecular 
67 
interactions with B cells in the germinal centers, following the initial priming in the T cell zone18, 
68 
19, 20, 21. Far less is known about the early stages of TFH differentiation and the role of APC-derived 
69 
innate immune signals in controlling this process, especially in humans. Targeted mobilization of 
70 
TFH responses poses a major hurdle in vaccine development. Therefore, the identification of 
71 
particular innate immune pathways with TFH-skewing capacity in humans would be highly 
72 
desirable for the rational design of TFH-targeted vaccine adjuvants.  
73 
  
 
4 
 
In this study, we systematically compared human immune responses to live and dead 
74 
attenuated bacteria and found that innate immune recognition of bacterial viability leads to 
75 
transcriptional remodeling in professional APC, and induces TFH promoting signals, most 
76 
importantly IL-12. Human APC distinguish precisely between viable and dead bacteria 
77 
independently of virulence, through the detection of bacterial RNA via the endosomal RNA sensor 
78 
TLR8. Recognition of live bacteria by human APC promotes the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T 
79 
cells into IL-21 producing BCL6+CXCR5+ICOS+PD1+ TFH cells. Activation of TLR8 in APC by 
80 
its natural ligand bacterial RNA, or by synthetic agonists promotes subsequent TFH cell 
81 
differentiation. In contrast, killed bacteria or other TLR agonists, including licensed vaccine 
82 
adjuvants, which were tested head-to-head with TLR8 agonists, failed to do so even at high 
83 
concentrations. Consequently, TLR8 gene silencing in APC inhibited bacterial-induced TFH 
84 
programming. Confirming the importance of viability recognition in vivo, we observed robust TFH 
85 
differentiation in swine in response to immunization with a live attenuated strain of Salmonella 
86 
enterica serovar Typhimurium, a commonly used vaccine in pig farming. This is the first 
87 
description of TFH-like cells in pigs, which were not increased after immunization with the heat 
88 
killed version of the same vaccine.  Outbred farm pigs represent a valuable immunological model 
89 
and they are a major target population for prophylactic vaccines, in order to decrease antibiotic 
90 
consumption and the development of antibiotic resistance. Finally, a case-control study revealed a 
91 
strong association of a hypermorphic TLR8 polymorphism and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-
92 
induced protection from tuberculosis infection, linking TLR8 function to protective immunity in 
93 
response to a live attenuated vaccine in humans. In summary, we identify recognition of bacterial 
94 
viability as a conserved innate immune checkpoint that preferentially promotes TFH cell 
95 
differentiation and humoral immunity. Our study highlights the importance of studying innate 
96 
immunity in humans and we propose vita-PAMP receptors such as TLR8 as promising targets for 
97 
TFH-skewing adjuvants to improve the efficacy of modern subunit vaccines.

RESULTS 
101 
Detection of live bacteria promotes TFH cell differentiation 
102 
In order to assess the contribution of innate immune signals on human TFH cell differentiation, we 
103 
co-cultured classical human CD14+CD16– monocytes, as APC, with autologous naïve CD4+ T 
104 
cells. APC were stimulated with either live avirulent thymidine auxotrophic (thyA–, replication 
105 
defective) Escherichia coli (hereafter referred to as EC)8 or a heat killed versions of the same E. 
106 
coli (HKEC). We intentionally chose avirulent auxotrophic bacteria in order to selectively analyze 
107 
the impact of bacterial viability without confounding effects due to virulence factors and bacterial 
108 
replication8. Ninety minutes after bacterial stimulation of APC we added antibiotics and naïve 
109 
CD4 T cells and assessed T helper cell differentiation five days later. Notably, stimulation of APC 
110 
with live bacteria induced naïve CD4+ T cells to produce large quantities of TFH- and TH1- 
111 
signature cytokines IL-21 and interferon- (IFN- respectively (Fig. 1a,b). This response was 
112 
virtually absent when APC were stimulated with heat killed bacteria or medium alone (Fig. 1a,b). 
113 
In contrast to IL-21 production, T cell proliferation rates were similar in all conditions, and IL-17 
114 
was produced at moderate levels regardless of bacterial viability (Fig. 1a,b). In line with the 
115 
increased IL-21 production, stimulation with viable but not killed bacteria also promoted the 
116 
expression of prototypical TFH cell surface markers CXCR5, ICOS and PD-110, 11, 22(Fig. 1c,d and 
117 
Supplementary Fig. 1a).  
118 
B-cell lymphoma-6 (BCL6) is considered the lineage defining transcription factor of TFH cells, and 
119 
it is required for successful TFH cell development16, 17. APC stimulated with live bacteria induced 
120 
BCL6 and IL-21 co-expression in CD4+ T cells, whereas APC stimulated with killed bacteria failed 
121 
to do so (Fig. 1e,f). The observed effects were not restricted to monocytes, since similar results 
122 
were obtained using primary human CD1c+ myeloid dendritic cells (mDC-1) as APC instead of 
123 
monocytes (Fig. 1g,h). Other T helper cell lineage defining transcription factors T-bet (encoded 
124 
by TBX21) and GATA-3 were downregulated by bacterial stimulation of APC as compared to T 
125 
cells activated with unstimulated APC, whereas RORT (encoded by RORC) and MAF were 
126 
slightly increased in both EC and HKEC conditions (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Fig. 1b). 
127 
Functional properties of de novo differentiated TFH cells  
128 
Differentiation of TFH cells occurs in a complex multi-step process12, 13. An initial priming step 
129 
involving conventional APC23 induces transient expression of TFH-associated genes in a subset of 
130 
  
 
6 
 
CD4+ T cells15 allowing for their migration towards the B cell zone within secondary lymphoid 
131 
organs12, 24. There, interaction with B cells, which then take over antigen presentation, stabilizes 
132 
the TFH differentiation program and initiates the germinal center response12, 14, 25, 26. In order to 
133 
mimic the first two stages of TFH cell differentiation we employed a sequential co-culture system, 
134 
in which naïve CD4+ T cells were first primed by EC-stimulated monocytes as in Figure 1, re-
135 
purified from the culture after five days, and subsequently co-cultured with autologous naïve B 
136 
cells for an additional seven days. Notably, the TFH phenotype was maintained and increased over 
137 
the combined culture period of 12 days (Fig. 2a) indicating that the initial priming did not merely 
138 
induce transiently IL-21-expressing effector cells27. 
139 
In order to assess their functionality as bona fide B cell helpers, we sorted  de novo 
140 
differentiated CD4+CD45RA-CXCR5+ TFH cells and compared them side by side with autologous 
141 
naïve CD4+CD45RA+CXCR5- T cells for their ability to promote plasma cell differentiation of co-
142 
cultured B cells. Indeed, CXCR5+ TFH generated in response to live bacteria induced robust 
143 
differentiation of CD27++CD38+ plasma cells, which naïve T cells from the same donor failed to 
144 
induce (Fig. 2b,c). This was also mirrored by the robust IgG production induced by co-culture 
145 
with in vitro differentiated TFH cells, which was not observed with B cells alone or after co-culture 
146 
with naïve T cells   (Fig. 2d). CXCR5– T cells sorted from the same cultures provided relatively 
147 
weaker help compared to CXCR5+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a-d). Collectively, the results 
148 
demonstrate that innate immune recognition of viable, but not killed bacteria by human APC elicits 
149 
potent differentiation signals for the generation of fully functional TFH cells. 
150 
Detection of bacterial viability uniquely shapes the cytokine profile of APC 
151 
In order to characterize the innate immune signals that control TFH programming upon recognition 
152 
of bacterial viability, we compared the transcriptional responses of human APC to live and dead 
153 
bacteria. In contrast to the drastically altered T cell responses (Fig. 1), detection of live and dead 
154 
bacteria elicited very similar transcriptional programs in human monocytes (Fig. 3a). The highly 
155 
congruent response to EC and HKEC reflects the high similarity between the two stimuli, both of 
156 
which contain an abundance of PAMPs and lead to strong APC activation through engagement of 
157 
a multitude of pattern recognition receptors8. Strikingly, a narrow set of 193 genes was 
158 
differentially regulated in response to live compared to dead bacteria, including the genes encoding 
159 
for inflammatory cytokines TNF (TNF) and IL-12p40 (IL12B) (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary 
160 
  
 
7 
 
Table 1). Accordingly, IL-12 and TNF were released nearly exclusively in response to live but not 
161 
dead bacteria, whereas other cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, IL-23, and GM-CSF were produced 
162 
regardless of bacterial viability (Fig. 3c). Thus, human APC discriminate precisely between live 
163 
and dead bacteria and remodel their transcriptional program and subsequent cytokine production 
164 
in response to the detection of bacterial viability. Differential expression of IL-12 and TNF was 
165 
unexpected given previous observations in murine APC, which produce large amounts of TNF and 
166 
IL-12 in response to both live and killed bacteria or purified bacterial cell wall components8. 
167 
Similar to murine APC8 though, IL-1 release was specifically induced by viable bacteria in 
168 
human APC indicating inflammasome activation (Fig. 3c)8. Production of TNF and IL-12 was 
169 
dependent on the presence of live bacteria and could not be restored by higher doses of killed 
170 
bacteria (Fig. 3d). Other bacterial species, including avirulent Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, and 
171 
BCG, an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis and widely-used live vaccine against 
172 
tuberculosis (TB), elicited comparable cytokine patterns (Fig. 3e), indicating that the response to 
173 
bacterial viability is conserved and largely independent of bacterial species-specific features. In 
174 
contrast to the distinct cytokine patterns elicited by live and dead bacteria, both stimuli induced a 
175 
similar up-regulation of various maturation markers in APC, again emphasizing the intact innate 
176 
recognition of both stimuli (Fig. 3f). 
177 
‘Viability-induced’ TFH responses are mediated by APC-derived IL-12 
178 
Based on these results, we hypothesized that APC-derived cytokines were responsible for the 
179 
observed early TFH differentiation upon detection of live bacteria. Indeed, polyclonally activated 
180 
CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of IL-21 when differentiated in conditioned culture 
181 
supernatants from APC that had been stimulated with live bacteria (Fig. 4a,b). Conditioned culture 
182 
supernatants from HKEC-treated APC failed to induce substantial IL-21 production by T cells. 
183 
Thus, apart from slightly higher background IL-21 and IFN-levels, the cell contact-free system 
184 
essentially reproduced the results of the co-culture experiments, which allow for direct cell contact 
185 
between APC and T cells (Fig. 1). As in the co-cultures, no differences in proliferation rates and 
186 
IL-17 production were observed (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). These results support a dominant 
187 
role of APC-derived cytokines in the initial stages of TFH differentiation in response to live EC. 
188 
Various cytokines and cytokine combinations have previously been found to promote TFH 
189 
cell differentiation in mice, including IL-21 itself, IL-6, IL-27 and type I IFN28, 29, 30, 31, whereas 
190 
  
 
8 
 
IL-12, TGF- and to a lesser extent IL-23, IL-6, and potentially IL-27, contribute to the 
191 
differentiation of human TFH cells30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. Yet it is unclear which cytokines are responsible 
192 
for infection- or vita-PAMP-induced human TFH cell differentiation. We compared cytokine levels 
193 
in the EC-stimulated APC supernatants with subsequent IL-21 production by CD4+ T cells and 
194 
found a strong correlation between APC-derived IL-12 levels and subsequent IL-21 production by 
195 
activated T cells, whereas TNF and IL-6 levels did not correlate with T cell-derived IL-21 (Fig. 
196 
4c). Neutralization of IL-12 in APC supernatants virtually abolished TFH differentiation, without 
197 
affecting T cell proliferation rates (Fig 4d-f and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In contrast, 
198 
neutralization of IL-6 and IL-27 had no significant effect, whereas TNF blockade partially 
199 
inhibited TFH differentiation (Fig. 4d-f). Conversely, supplementing control-APC supernatants 
200 
with recombinant IL-12 restored TFH cell differentiation (Fig. 4d-f). Recombinant TNF alone was 
201 
insufficient to promote a TFH phenotype, indicating that it might play a minor role or act in concert 
202 
with IL-12 or other APC-derived factors (Fig. 4g). Recognition of vita-PAMPs by APC induces 
203 
robust production of IL-1Fig. 3c) and type I IFN8 in mice. Human TFH cell differentiation was 
204 
only partially diminished by neutralization of IL-1 and supplementation of control supernatants 
205 
with recombinant IL-1 alone was insufficient to support TFH cell differentiation (Supplementary 
206 
Fig.3d-f), indicating that IL-1 may have additive effects in humans, consistent with previous 
207 
observations32. Blocking IFN- or supplementing recombinant IFN- did not alter human TFH cell 
208 
differentiation in our experiments (Supplementary Fig.3d-f). While additional membrane bound 
209 
mediators such as ICOSL20 and OX40L37 contribute to different stages of TFH differentiation in 
210 
vivo, we found no major differences in the surface levels of both molecules on APC after 
211 
stimulation with live and dead bacteria (Fig. 3f). Although this does not exclude an important role 
212 
for these membrane-bound molecules at later stages, we conclude that IL-12 is the critical innate 
213 
immune signal produced in response to live bacteria to instruct early TFH cell priming in humans. 
214 
Human APC sense bacterial viability via TLR8  
215 
Vaccine adjuvants activate the innate immune system and as such they are essential components 
216 
of all clinically relevant subunit vaccines38. Targeted activation of TFH-polarizing innate immune 
217 
pathways would be highly desirable for vaccination purposes, given the broad protection offered 
218 
by high titers of neutralizing and opsonizing antibodies. We therefore investigated the nature of 
219 
the innate immune receptor(s) and their ligands that elicit ‘viability-induced’ TFH differentiation 
220 
  
 
9 
 
signals in APC. Assuming a critical role for vita-PAMPs8, we supplemented HKEC with various 
221 
PAMPs and compared subsequent cytokine responses. Only ligands of the endosomal ssRNA 
222 
receptors TLR7/8 restored IL-12 and TNF production to levels comparable with viable bacteria 
223 
(Fig. 5a). Inhibition of actin polymerization and phagocytosis using Cytochalasin D as well as 
224 
blockade of endolysosomal acidification with Bafilomycin A abrogated EC-induced production of 
225 
IL-12 but not IL-6, further suggesting an involvement of endosomal TLRs in the sensing of viable 
226 
bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 4a). 
227 
Since human monocytes express TLR8 but only low levels of TLR7 (Supplementary Fig. 
228 
4b)39, and TLR8 has been recently shown to recognize bacterial RNA40, 41, we reasoned that TLR8 
229 
might be the primary human vita-PAMP receptor for live bacteria. Indeed, endosomal delivery of 
230 
bacterial RNA fully restored cytokine production to levels comparable to those induced by live 
231 
bacteria and synthetic TLR7/8 agonists (Fig 5b) and induced upregulation of activation markers 
232 
on APC (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Conversely, silencing the expression of TLR8 and its essential 
233 
signaling adaptor molecule MyD88 by RNA interference abrogated IL-12p70 and TNF release in 
234 
response to viable EC (Fig. 5c,d). Production of IL-6, which does not require bacterial viability, 
235 
was not affected by TLR8- or MyD88 gene silencing (Fig. 5c,d).  
236 
These results identify TLR8 as the primary sensor for bacterial viability and critical regulator of 
237 
cytokine responses, including IL-12 production in human APC. 
238 
Detection of bacterial RNA via TLR8 induces TFH differentiation 
239 
In line with its critical role in the recognition of live bacteria by human APC, TLR8 ligation dose-
240 
dependently induced TFH cell differentiation (Fig. 6a-c).  In contrast, all other TLR ligands tested, 
241 
including the licensed vaccine adjuvants monophosphoryl lipid A (TLR4 agonist) and CpG-DNA 
242 
(TLR9 agonist), failed to promote TFH cell responses even at high concentrations (Fig. 6a-c). 
243 
Similar to live bacteria, TLR8 activation by purified bacterial RNA resulted in high levels of TFH 
244 
cells and IL-21 production (Fig. 6d, e), demonstrating that innate immune recognition of bacterial 
245 
RNA is a potent stimulator of TFH differentiation signals. Finally, silencing TLR8 expression in 
246 
APC diminished their capacity to promote TFH differentiation in response to live bacteria (Fig. 6f, 
247 
g). Collectively, these results identify TLR8 as the critical sensor for bacterial viability in human 
248 
APC and critical inducer of subsequent TFH responses. 
249 
 
250

Recognition of bacterial viability is conserved in porcine APC  
251 
Domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) are increasingly utilized for biomedical and pharmaceutical 
252 
studies due to the substantial analogies between porcine and human physiology42, 43. The porcine 
253 
and the human immune system also shares many similarities43, including expression and function 
254 
of TLR844. Owing to the drastic increase in antibiotic resistance rates and frequent emergence of 
255 
veterinary pathogens in industrial animal farming, there is a growing need for prophylactic 
256 
vaccines in pigs, making them both an attractive model and a relevant target population for vaccine 
257 
studies. Here we assessed the relevance of viability recognition for TFH differentiation and vaccine 
258 
responses in pigs. 
259 
Porcine monocytes (CD172+CD14+) and dendritic cells (DC, CD172+CD14-) were sorted from 
260 
spleen samples of domestic pigs and stimulated with live and dead bacteria. We used the thymidine 
261 
auxotrophic E. coli (EC) and an attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 
262 
(ST) distributed under the trade name of Salmoporc-STM as a live Salmonella vaccine for pigs45. 
263 
Salmoporc-STM are histidine- and thymidine auxotrophs leading to severe growth attenuation in 
264 
the abseence of exogenous histidine and thymidine. Similar to human APC, porcine monocytes 
265 
and DC secreted high levels of IL-12 in response to live bacteria and TLR8 agonist CL075, but 
266 
not upon stimulation with heat killed ST (HKST) and HKEC (Fig. 7a,b). Secretion of IL-6 was 
267 
similarly induced by live and dead bacteria (Fig. 7a, b). Selective induction of IL-12 by live 
268 
bacteria was consinstently observed, yet statistical testing did not reveal significant differences 
269 
due to high inter-experimental variation in cytokine production. Purified bacterial RNA also 
270 
promoted increased secretion of IL-12p40 in porcine monocytes, not observed with ligands of 
271 
TLR2 and TLR4  (Supplementary Fig. 5).  In order to confirm that the mechanisms of ‘viability 
272 
recognition’ are conserved between human and porcine APC, we silenced the expression of TLR8  
273 
in porcine CD14+ monocytes by RNAi. Knock down of TLR8 abrogated IL-12p40 expression in 
274 
response to live ST, whereas IL-6 production, which is induced independently of bacterial 
275 
viability, was unaffected by TLR8 silencing (Fig. 7c). Hence, recognition of bacterial viability 
276 
requires TLR8 in human and porcine APC. We next assessed the impact of bacterial viability on 
277 
porcine TFH cell differentiation. Splenocytes (containing APCs and CD4+ T cells) were stimulated 
278 
with increasing doses of live ST or HKST for one hour, followed by addition of antibiotics to 
279 
prevent residual bacterial growth. Concanavalin A (ConA) was used to induce polyclonal T cell 
280 
proliferation. We observed  a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of CD4+IL-21+ BCL6+

TFH-like cells in response to ST, which was absent upon stimulation with HKST, regardless of the 
282 
bacterial dose (Fig. 7d,e). Hence, innate recognition of bacterial viability, i.e. vita-PAMPs, 
283 
specifically controls porcine TFH differentiation. These findings represent the first demonstration 
284 
of TFH-like cells in swine. When we compared the capacity of soluble PAMPs to induce a TFH 
285 
phenotype in splenocyte cultures, we found that TLR8 agonists bacterial RNA and CL075, but not 
286 
TLR4 agonist LPS induced CD4+IL21+ BCL6+ T cells (Fig. 7f). Thus, recognition of bacterial 
287 
viability via TLR8 plays a critical role for procine TFH cell differentiation. 
288 
Bacterial viability promotes TFH differentiation in vivo 
289 
To directly assess the role of innate immune detection of bacterial viability for TFH cell responses 
290 
in vivo, we vaccinated domestic pigs with live attenuated ST (Salmoporc-STM), or with an 
291 
equivalent dose of heat inactivated vaccine (HKST), or solvent as control. Increased frequencies 
292 
of CD4+IL-21+ BCL6+ TFH-like cells were detected in the draining (dorsal superficial cervical) 
293 
lymph node and in the spleen of animals immunized with the live attenuated vaccine compared to 
294 
animals receiving the heat killed vaccine or saline control (Fig. 8a, b). The specific effects of the 
295 
live vaccine on TFH differentiation was underscored by the fact that other markers of T effector 
296 
cell differentiation, including lineage defining transcription factors Tbet (TH1) and FoxP3 (TREG) 
297 
were similarly altered in T cells from the ST and the HKST vaccine group (Supplementary Fig 
298 
6a-d).  
299 
As a further indication of enhanced follicular helper cell responses following ST vaccination, we 
300 
observed markedly increased PAX5+ B cell follicles in the spleen of ST vaccinated pigs compared 
301 
to controls, which was not observed in the HKST group when compared to controls (Fig. 8c, d), 
302 
albeit no statistical difference was detected between the ST and the HKST group. B cell follicles 
303 
were highly enriched in KI67+PAX5+ B cells, indicative of active germinal centers (Fig. 8e, 
304 
Supplementary Fig. 7a), but were negative for BCL2 ruling out malignant transformation 
305 
(Supplementary Fig. 7b).  We also found increased CD3-CD8-SLAII+IgM+CD2+/-CD21- antibody 
306 
forming cells (AFC) / plasma cells (PC)46 in ST- as compared to HKST-vaccinated animals (Fig. 
307 
8f). Importantly, higher levels of Salmonella-binding serum-IgG were detected after vaccination 
308 
with live ST, as a direct evidence of enhanced humoral immunity in response to the live, compared 
309 
to the killed vaccine (Fig. 8g). 
310 
  
 
12 
 
These results corroborated our findings with primary human cells, and they establish the 
311 
recognition of bacterial viability as an essential driver of vaccine-induced TFH cell responses in 
312 
vivo.  
313 
 A functional TLR8 polymorphism is associated with vaccine protection in humans 
314 
Several functional polymorphisms in the gene encoding for TLR8 in humans have been 
315 
described47, 48. The TLR8 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) TLR8-A1G (rs3764880, 
316 
hereafter referred to as TLR8-G) alters the start ATG codon into a GTG triplet47 shifting the signal 
317 
peptide by three amino acids with a second in frame ATG (M4) being used as alternative start 
318 
codon. We performed in silico modeling predictions, based on the published crystal structure of 
319 
TLR849. According to these models, the amino acid truncation leads to significant structural 
320 
alterations of the protein (Supplementary Figure 8-10 and Supplementary Text). Increased 
321 
disorder, free energy, and increased flexibility of TLR8-G likely make the receptor better adapted 
322 
to side chain rearrangement and dimerization. The larger volume of clefts and cavities on the 
323 
surface of TLR8-G, compared to TLR8-A, may increase its potential for ligand binding, whereas 
324 
functional pockets and nests are slightly decreased (Supplementary Fig. 9, 10). These models 
325 
suggest an altered receptor functionality, which may cause a gain-of-function in the TLR8-G 
326 
variant. In line with these predictions, APC from individuals carrying either the TLR8-A or TLR8-
327 
G  variant showed a slightly enhanced IL-12 response to TLR8 stimulation, but not in response to 
328 
TLR4 agonist LPS (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). High inter-donor variation combined with the  
329 
moderate gain of function phenotype account for the modest, but significant impact on cytokine 
330 
production.  Analysis of TLR8-G and TLR8-A function in a standardized reporter cell system 
331 
confirmed the gain-of-function phenotype, since reporter cells expressing the TLR8-G variant 
332 
showed stronger NF-B activation in response to TLR8 ligands compared to TLR8-A expressing 
333 
cells (Supplementary Fig. 11c).  
334 
Previous studies have associated TLR8-G allele carriage with slower progression of HIV-
335 
infection47, and protection against pulmonary TB (PTB)50. Here, we assessed TLR8-G allele 
336 
distribution in 293 patients with confirmed TB and 165 of their healthy household contacts 
337 
(Supplementary Table 2). Significantly more controls (53.9%) were homo- or hemizygous 
338 
TLR8-G carriers than TB patients (41.3%) (Fig. 9a, left panel and Supplementary Table 3). The 
339 
TLR8-A allele was associated with significantly increased odds for TB infection (OR=1.94 [1.194-
340 
  
 
13 
 
3.156];p=0.007), and similar results were found in the PTB subgroup (Fig. 9a, right panel and 
341 
Supplementary Table 3), confirming the protective effect of the TLR8-G allele against PTB as 
342 
previously reported50. However, further subgroup analyses revealed that TLR8 allele distribution 
343 
was in fact significantly different only in subjects who had previously received the BCG vaccine 
344 
against TB (p=0.002), whereas allele distribution was not different (p=0.754) in unvaccinated 
345 
subjects (Fig. 9b and Supplementary Table 4). Consequently, in this study population, BCG-
346 
vaccination is associated with a significant risk protection in TLR8-G carriers (OR=0.280 [CI95% 
347 
0.105-0.742]), but not in TLR8-A allele carriers (Fig. 9c and Supplementary Table 4). These 
348 
epidemiological results indicate that TLR8-G carriage is associated with an improved BCG-
349 
vaccine mediated protection without affecting susceptibility to PTB per se. The study links TLR8 
350 
function to protective immunity in response to a live bacterial vaccine in a large human cohort.  
351 
 
352 
DISCUSSION  
353 
Our study identifies innate immune recognition of microbial viability as a hard-wired, conserved 
354 
immune checkpoint, which critically regulates innate and adaptive immunity. We describe TLR8 
355 
as the first vita-PAMP receptor in humans and pigs, activation of which renders APC highly 
356 
effective inducers of TFH responses. We provide experimental and epidemiological evidence to 
357 
support a critical function of viability recognition and TLR8 in the immune responses to live 
358 
attenuated vaccines in humans and pigs.  
359 
Recent studies in non-human primates have revealed a unique adjuvant activity of TLR8 
360 
agonists51, 52, 53. Innate immune responses to TLR8 agonist-containing nanoparticles were highly 
361 
similar to responses evoked by live BCG, but distinct from those elicited by various inanimate 
362 
vaccines51. Supplementation of the commercial alum-adjuvanted pneumococcal glycoconjugate 
363 
vaccine (PCV13) with an TLR8 agonist strongly increased IgG responses in newborn rhesus 
364 
macaques52. We show that live attenuated bacteria as well as purified bacterial RNA or synthetic 
365 
TLR8 agonists selectively modulate the cytokine profile of APC and promote TFH responses, 
366 
which dead bacteria and other TLR ligands fail to induce. Moreover, we found a functional TLR8 
367 
polymorphism to be associated with increased cytokine production in response to TLR8 synthetic 
368 
ligands and with enhanced protection afforded by BCG vaccination in early life, clearly supporting 
369 
a link between TLR8 functionality and vaccine responses in humans (Fig. 9). These findings may 
370 
  
 
14 
 
also help to explain the diverging efficacies of BCG-vaccination reported in various studies54. 
371 
While the role of TFH cells cannot be assessed in this retrospective case-control study, mounting 
372 
evidence suggest a critical contribution of TFH and a T cell-dependent antibody responses in BCG 
373 
vaccination and anti-mycobacterial immunity55, 56, 57, 58. In particular, IL-12 has been recently 
374 
linked to the devolpment of TFH-like cells at the site of TB infection58. Supporting the notion that 
375 
BCG vaccination elicits TFH cell dependent responses, we found increased TFH cell frequencies in 
376 
the spleens of pigs 30 days after BCG vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 12). Although commonly 
377 
used live vaccines are diverse and likely activate multiple pathways59, we propose innate immune 
378 
recognition of microbial viability and subsequent promotion of T cell-driven immunity as a 
379 
unifying motif in the responses to live attenuated vaccines.  
380 
In order to further validate our findings, we studied vaccine responses to live attenuated 
381 
bacteria in pigs. Vaccine studies in large animals such as pigs are challenging, due to obvious 
382 
limitations in group size and a relative lack of advanced tools and experimental models (e.g. TCR-
383 
transgenic or PRR-deficient animals) compared to mice. On the other hand, domestic pigs offer 
384 
major advantages over established rodent models, given their closer resemblance of human 
385 
physiology with regards to size, life span, organ anatomy, diet, circadian rhythm, and immunity 42, 
386 
60. Conventional non-specific-pathogen-free(SPF) housing and outbreeding of the animals also 
387 
makes for a better comparability to humans. More importantly, besides serving as a model, 
388 
domestic farm animals represent a critical target population for vaccination in order to improve 
389 
animal- and public health. High antibiotic consumption in industrial animal farming is considered 
390 
a major driving force of  antibiotic resistance61, and efficacious veterinary vaccines are therefore 
391 
urgently needed62. Here we used a well-established swine vaccine against Salmonella enterica 
392 
infections to dissect the immune responses to live attenuated bacteria in pigs. Our study provides 
393 
the first evidence of TFH-like cells in pigs and describes their induction upon recognition of 
394 
bacterial viability in vitro and in vivo  (Fig. 7 and 8). While future studies are clearly needed to 
395 
fully characterize the generation of protective immunity in pigs, our study contributes new insights 
396 
into the mechanisms of actions of live attenuated vaccines and highlights swine as a valuable 
397 
species for vaccine and TFH cell research.  
398 
In contrast to the detailed knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of TFH cells and their 
399 
interaction with B cells, few studies have investigated the TFH-polarizing potential of different 
400 
innate immune stimuli like vaccine adjuvants. The requirement for conventional APC in priming 
401 
  
 
15 
 
TFH cell responses is evident12, 14, 23 and it was previously suggested that innate activation signals 
402 
could determine the capacity of APC to prime TFH cell responses. Yet, the nature of TFH-favoring 
403 
innate immune stimuli has remained largely unknown. Several studies have addressed the impact 
404 
of TLR activation on the development of TFH cells and germinal center formation in mice63, 64, 65, 
405 
66, 67, 68, 69. For instance, it has been reported that monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) are 
406 
important stimulators of TFH cell responses in mice, especially when activated via TLR970. 
407 
However, TFH cell differentiation in mice and humans differs substantially, with regards to the 
408 
involved cytokines, as well as the innate immune receptor repertoires in mice and human APC. 
409 
This is exemplified by the differential functionality of human and murine TLR8, the latter being 
410 
irresponsive to ssRNA71. These factors severely hamper the translation of findings from studies in 
411 
laboratory mice to human TFH cell- and vaccine responses71. Human monocytes  hardly induce TFH 
412 
differentiation in response to CpG DNA compared to stimulation with viable bacteria and TLR8 
413 
agonists (Fig. 6a-c). Previous work suggested that heat killed bacteria and bacterial 
414 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were sufficient to induce TFH cell differentiation by human in vitro 
415 
differentiated Mo-DC35. However, Mo-DC produce large quantities of bioactive IL-12, due to the 
416 
enhancing effects of IL-4 contained in the differentiation medium72. In contrast, primary 
417 
CD14+CD16- monocytes, as well as porcine monocytes and DC, secrete high amounts of IL-12 in 
418 
response to live bacteria and TLR8 ligation, while production of IL-12 and the TFH-skewing 
419 
capacity is not observed when APC are stimulated with heat killed bacteria or LPS (Fig. 3, Fig. 
420 
6a, b, Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, we detected an increase in CD4+IL-21+ 
421 
BCL6+ T cells following ex vivo culture of porcine splenocytes with increasing doses of ST, which 
422 
was not observed with HKST (Fig. 7d-e). Similarly, CD4+IL-21+ BCL6+ T cells increased in the 
423 
draining lymph nodes and in the spleens of pigs following vaccination with a live attenuated 
424 
Salmonella strain, which was not observed upon immunization with the killed version of the same 
425 
bacterium (Fig. 8a, b). The latter contains large quantities of PAMPs, including LPS, yet it did not 
426 
induce TFH cell differentiation, further underscoring the dependency of TFH cell responses on 
427 
bacterial viability and vita-PAMPs.  
428 
So far, primary immunodeficiencies (PID) associated with TLR8 deficiency have not been 
429 
reported. However, patients with gene defects in TLR adaptor proteins MyD88 or IRAK-4 suffer 
430 
from PID and show a higher susceptibility to bacterial infection73, 74. The frequency of TFH cells 
431 
has not been investigated in individuals with these rare gene defects.  
432 
  
 
16 
 
Individuals harbouring loss of function mutations in the IL-12 receptor (IL12R1B), the 
433 
cytokine driving TFH cell differentiation in response to TLR8 ligation, display lower numbers of 
434 
circulating TFH cells and reduced GC formation in lymph nodes34. Other studies have reported a 
435 
less pronounced phenotype in older adults, however these studies investigated fewer individuals75, 
436 
76. Naïve CD4+ T cells isolated from IL12R1B deficient individuals fail to induce IL-21 in respose 
437 
to IL-12 stimulation in vitro75. A similar phenotype was observed with T cells from indivudals 
438 
harbouring a heterozygous STAT3 deficiency75, which also exhibit reduced circulating TFH cells75, 
439 
76.  Notably, antibody levels are largely normal in IL12R1-deficient individuals, yet serum IgG 
440 
against tetanus toxoid have a lower avidity, which was not observed with viral antigens, possibly 
441 
due to longer persistence of the antigen34. These observations highlight our need to better 
442 
characterize human immune responses in PID patients, which will allow the identification of non-
443 
redundant signaling modules, as well as potential compensation mechanisms.  
444 
Given the broad functionality of high affinity antibody responses, it has been proposed that 
445 
any microbial stimulus or PAMP is likely to induce TFH differentiation12. Here we challenge this 
446 
wide-spread notion showing that only viable bacteria and agonists of TLR8 promote robust TFH 
447 
cell formation (Fig. 6, 7, 8) and thus provide insights into the proximal innate sensing events that 
448 
govern early TFH differentiation.  
449 
High affinity antibodies are indeed a versatile mechanism of defense against many 
450 
pathogens, yet uncontrolled TFH activation can cause autoimmunity and debilitating diseases22, 77. 
451 
We have previously proposed that antimicrobial immune responses are tightly scaled to the level 
452 
of the microbial threat and we suggested a series of innate immune checkpoints that facilitate an 
453 
accurate immunological risk assessment7. Here we show that the recognition of bacterial RNA, as 
454 
a molecular signature of microbial viability (vita-PAMP)8, constitutes a critical trigger of TFH 
455 
differentiation. We propose that the nature and the composition of microbial stimuli, i.e. the 
456 
presence of vita-PAMPs (together with immunogenic antigens), is critical to instruct TFH cell 
457 
responses. This provides an efficient checkpoint without limiting the versatility of TFH cells in the 
458 
defense against  microbial threats.  
459 
The identification of TLR8 as a critical sensor of vita-PAMPs and regulator of preferential 
460 
TFH differentiation provides opportunities for the development of TFH-targeted vaccine adjuvants, 
461 
  
 
17 
 
which are sorely needed to improve existing and future inanimate subunit vaccines against a broad 
462 
range of infectious and non-infectious diseases.

Materials and Methods 
743 
Cell isolation and culture 
744 
Human monocytes, T cells and B cells used in this study were either freshly isolated from 
745 
peripheral venous blood of healthy volunteers or from buffy coats obtained from the German Red 
746 
Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Berlin, Germany. Permission for experiments with human 
747 
primary cells was obtained from the local ethic committee. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
748 
(PBMC) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation over Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich; 
749 
Steinheim, Germany). CD14+CD16- monocytes were purified by negative selection via 
750 
immunomagnetic separation using EasySep monocyte isolation kits with CD16 depletion 
751 
(Stemcell Technologies; Grenoble, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated 
752 
monocytes were cultured at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% 
753 
fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% glutamine, 1% HEPES buffer, 1% non-essential amino acids (all from 
754 
Sigma-Aldrich). T cells were cultured in RPMI1640  supplemented with 10% human serum (from 
755 
the respective T cell donor), 1% glutamine, 1% HEPES buffer, 1% non-essential amino acids, 
756 
some T cell conditions were supplemented with 2,5ng/ml of TGF-β (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). 
757 
All cells were grown at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. 
758 
Untouched human CD1+ mDC were purified by negative selection via immunomagnetic bead 
759 
separation (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) following the manufacturer’s 
760 
instructions.  
761 
Naïve CD4+ T cells were purified by immunomagnetic separation using negative selection 
762 
(MagniSort™ Human CD4 Naïve T cell Enrichment Kit, eBioscience, San Diego, CA ). Total 
763 
CD4+ T cells (used in Figure 3A, B and D, and Fig. 4F and G and fig. S3) were isolated by magnetic 
764 
separation using negative selection (MagniSort™ Human CD4 T cell Enrichment Kit, 
765 
eBioscience).  
766 
Untouched naïve human B cells were isolated by immunomagnetic bead separation (Miltenyi 
767 
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions.  
768 
Cell purity was routinely checked by flow cytometry and only purities of >85% (monocytes) and 
769 
>95% (T and B) cells were used for subsequent experiments. 
770 
 
771 
  
 
26 
 
Bacteria and infection 
772 
Escherichia coli K12, strain DH5α, thymidine auxotrophs (thyA−) were selected as previously 
773 
described4. Auxotrophy was confirmed by inoculation and overnight culture of single colonies in 
774 
LB medium. ThyA− E. coli (hereafter referred to as EC) grew only in the presence of thymidine 
775 
and were resistant to trimethoprim. For phagocytosis experiments, EC were grown to mid-log 
776 
phase, washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove thymidine and LB salts before 
777 
addition to cells. For heat killing, EC were grown to log phase, washed and re-suspended in PBS 
778 
at an optical density at 600nm (OD600) of 0.6, and subsequently incubated at 60 °C for 90 min. 
779 
Heat-killed thyA−E. coli (HKEC) were used immediately after killing or stored at -80 °C for up to 
780 
three months. Efficient killing was confirmed by overnight plating on thymidine/trimethoprim-
781 
supplemented LB-agar plates. Alternatively, Bacillus subtilis strain 168 was used for analogous 
782 
infection experiments. For heat killing, B. subtilis were grown to mid-log phase, washed and re-
783 
suspended in PBS at an optical density at 600nm (OD 600) of 0.6, and subsequently incubated at 
784 
95°C for 30min. Efficient killing was confirmed by overnight plating on LB-agar plates. . For heat 
785 
killing, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium were grown to mid-log phase, washed and re-suspended 
786 
in PBS at an optical density at 600nm (OD 600) of 0.6, and subsequently incubated at 95°C for 
787 
30min. Efficient killing was confirmed by overnight plating on LB-agar plates. Infection of human 
788 
monocyte was performed at the indicated multiplicities of infection (MOI).  
789 
BCG was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80. For 
790 
phagocytosis experiments, BCG were grown to mid-log phase, washed once in phosphate buffered 
791 
saline (PBS) and resuspended in complete cell culture media via repeated tuberculin type needle 
792 
passages (10x). For heat killing, BCG were grown to log phase and incubated at 60°C for 90min. 
793 
Heat-killed BCG (HKBCG) were used immediately after killing. Efficient killing was confirmed 
794 
by 96h inoculation in competent media. 
795 
Co-culture assays 
796 
For monocyte : T cell co-cultures monocytes were cultured as described above and stimulated as 
797 
indicated (e.g. EC, HKEC MOI 1-25) in antibiotic-free medium. After one and a half hours, 
798 
penicillin/streptomycin (1%) was added together with autologous naïve CD4+ T cells at a 
799 
monocyte to T cell ratio of 2:1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB, Sigma) at a concentration 
800 
of 1.0µg/ml. After 5 days of co-culture T cells were harvested, washed, restimulated with Phorbol-
801 
  
 
27 
 
12-myristat-13-acetat (PMA, 50ng/ml) and Ionomycin (1µg/ml, both obtained from Sigma), 
802 
stained and analyzed by flow cytometry.  
803 
For T : B cell co-cultures, T cells were differentiated by co-cultures with autologous monocytes 
804 
for 6 days as described before. CXCR5+ICOS+PD-1hi T cells were sorted by flow cytometry (BD 
805 
FACS-Aria II) and added to naïve autologous B cells at a T to B cell ratio of 1:2 in the presence 
806 
of SEB (1µg/ml). After 12 days co-culture B and T cells were harvested and analyzed by flow 
807 
cytometry. For analysis of plasma blast differentiation, sorted TFH (CD19- CD4+ CD45RA- 
808 
CXCR5+) or naive (CD19- CD4+ CD45RA+) T cells were cocultured with memory B cells at a ratio 
809 
of 1:1 in the presence of 4 ng/ml SEB for 7 days.

838 
concentration: CL075 (3M002; 1µg/ml), LPS-EK Ultrapure (2µg/ml), Pam3CSK4 (200ng/ml), 
839 
Poly(I:C) LMW (2µg/ml), ODN 2395 (5µM). Bacterial RNA was isolated from mid-log phase 
840 
cultures of DH5alpha E. coli using Trizol (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany). Transfection 
841 
of bacterial RNA into human monocytes was performed using polycationic polypeptide poly-L -
842 
arginine (pLa) (Sigma-Aldrich). 
843 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  
844 
TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-23, GM-CSF and IL-27 concentrations in culture 
845 
supernatants were measured by ELISA (all purchased from eBioscience) according to standard 
846 
manufacturer’s recommendations. Concentrations of IL-12p70 were measured using human IL-
847 
12p70 High Sensitivity ELISA kit (eBioscience). The samples were analyzed for absorbance at 
848 
450 nm using FilterMax F5 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Biberach an der 
849 
Riss, Germany). Porcine IL-12p40 and IL-6 concentrations in culture supernatants were measured 
850 
by ProcartaPlex Pig Kit (eBioscience) or by Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems) and results 
851 
were collected using a Luminex MAGPIX instrument (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA). Human 
852 
IgG was determined by ELISA using polyclonal goat anti-human IgG (TAGO Immunologicals, 
853 
Burlingame, CA) and purified human IgG as standard. Results were collected on a Spark 
854 
multimode reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). 
855 
Anti-S. enterica IgG ELISA 
856 
96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 
857 
(Salmoporc-STM) lysates (3μg/ml) that we generated from log-phase cultures of Hys-Ade- S. 
858 
enterica. Serum samples from immunized pigs were serially diluted (12 dilutions) and incubated 
859 
in the pre-coated plates for 12 h at 4 °C followed by washing and incubation with goat anti-pig IgG 
860 
(gamma)-HRP (SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, MA) for 1 h. Bound goat anti-pig IgG (gamma)-
861 
  
 
29 
 
HRP was visualized by the addition of TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher), and the anti-S. enterica 
862 
antibody titers for each animals were visualized as absorbance readings at 450nm at a set serum 
863 
dilution of 1 to 51200. 
864 
RNA Isolation  
865 
CD14+CD16– human monocytes were sorted by flow cytometry and were infected with EC at 
866 
MOI=10 or stimulated with HKEC at 10:1 ratio of bacteria to cells. After 6 hours, cells were 
867 
harvested, washed once in PBS, and lysed in Trizol (Life Technologies). Total RNA was prepared 
868 
according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol.  
869 
Gene Array 
870 
Total RNA was prepared from four independent experiments (= four separate donors) according 
871 
to the Trizol manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were further purified on columns (RNeasy Micro 
872 
Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 
873 
RNA integrity was checked on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, 
874 
CA) with 6000 Nano Chips. RNA was judged as suitable only if samples showed intact bands of 
875 
18S and 28S ribosomal RNA subunits, displayed no chromosomal peaks or RNA degradation 
876 
products, and had a RNA integrity number (RIN) above 8.0. 
877 
One-hundred nanograms of RNA were used for whole-transcript cDNA synthesis with the Ambion 
878 
WT expression kit (Life Technologies). Hybridization, washing and scanning of an Affymetrix 
879 
GeneChip Human Gene 1.1 ST 24-array plate was carried out according to standard Affymetrix 
880 
protocols on a GeneTitan instrument (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). 
881 
Quality control, normalization and statistical analysis was performed using MADMAX, a pipeline 
882 
consisting of integrated Bioconductor packages78. Probe sets were redefined according to Dai et 
883 
al. using current genome information79. Normalized gene expression estimates were obtained from 
884 
the raw intensity values by using the robust multiarray analysis preprocessing algorithm available 
885 
in the library “AffyPLM” using default settings80. Only genes that were targeted by at least 7 
886 
probes, reached log2 expression level of>4.32 on at least three microarrays and had a log2 
887 
interquartile range value >0.25 across all samples were considered for further analysis.  Intensity-
888 
based moderated t-statistics were applied for pairwise comparisons to identify differentially 
889 
  
 
30 
 
regulated genes81. To correct for multiple testing a false discovery rate method was used to 
890 
calculate q-values82. A q-value < 0.01 was considered significant. 
891 
RNA interference  
892 
Silencer Select siRNA duplexes targeting TLR8 (sequence ID: s27920, s27921 and s27922), 
893 
MyD88 (sequence ID: s9136, s9137 and s9138) and negative controls were obtained from Life 
894 
Technologies. Monocytes cultured in 96-well plates were transfected with 25nM of each siRNA 
895 
using Viromer Blue transfection reagent (Lipocalyx, Leipzig, Germany) following manufacturer 
896 
recommendations for sensitive cells and reverse transfection. Cells were plated at a density 5x105 
897 
cells/ml in a final volume of 100µl in 96 well plates. Forty-eight hours post transfection cells were 
898 
infected or treated as described.  Knockdown of TLR8 and Myd88 was confirmed 48 hours after 
899 
siRNA transfection by RT-PCR using specific primers (TLR8: forward primer 5′-
900 
AgTTTCTCTTCTCggCCACC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ACATgTTTTCCATgTTTCTgTTgT -3′, 
901 
MyD88: forward primer 5′-TCTCCAggTgCCCATCAgAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′- 
902 
ggTTggTgTAgTCgCAgACA-3′).  
903 
Four Custom designed Silencer Select siRNA duplexes targeting porcine TLR8 (combination of 
904 
four siRNA duplexes) were purchased from Life Technologies with sequences:  
905 
TLR8-1 sense: 5´-GCAAAUUGAUUUUACCAUUTT-3′;

913 
Porcine CD14+ monocytes cultured in 96-well plates were transfected with 25nM of each siRNA 
914 
folloing the protocol desctribed above for human cells. Forty-eight hours post transfection cells 
915 
were infected or treated as described. 
916

Flow cytometry and cell sorting 
917 
Flow cytometry regularly was performed on a BD FACS Canto II cytometer Data was analyzed 
918 
using FlowJo software (Treestar, San Carlos, CA). 
919 
CD14+CD16- monocytes were sorted from PBMCs on a BD Aria II SORP cell sorter (BD 
920 
Biosciences) CD4+CXCR5+ and CD4+CXCR5- T cells were sorted from monocyte : T cell co-
921 
cultures on  a BD Aria II SORP cell sorter. In vitro generated Tfh cells were sorted on an ARIA II 
922 
sorter as CD19- CD4+ CD45RA- CXCR5+ and naive T cells as CD19- CD4+ CD45RA+. Memory B 
923 
cells were sorted from human tonsils as CD4- CD19+ IgD- CD38- cells. Cell purity checks were 
924 
performed and a purity of >97% was confirmed. 
925 
QuantiGene Plex transcript analysis  
926 
Quantigene multiplex-plex assay (Affymetrix,) was performed to quantify the expression of the 
927 
following genes GATA3, MAF, IL21, TBX21, RORC, FOXO1, BCL6 and two housekeeper genes 
928 
(ACTB and HPRT1) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, CD4+ T cells were lysed at 
929 
a concentration of 500 cell/μl of lysis mixture supplemented with proteinase K and incubated at 
930 
50°C for 30 min, prior to addition to a hybridization plate. The hybridization plate was sealed with 
931 
heat-sealing foil and placed in a shaking incubator (VorTemp 56) at 54±1°C and 600 rpm to allow 
932 
the samples to hybridize for 18-22 h. Fluorescent bead signal detection was obtained using Bio-
933 
Plex Suspension Array System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The mean fluorescent 
934 
intensity for each probe was recorded. 
935 
Animal experiment 
936 
The animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Danish Animal Welfare Act under 
937 
approval and authorization issued by the Danish Animal Experiment Inspectorate. 
938 
In total, 18 five-week-old pigs (Danish Landrace/Danish Yorkshire crossbreeds, paternal lineage 
939 
Duroc) of both sexes, raised on a commercial farm (Bøgekærgård, Faxe, Denmark) were stratified 
940 
by size (6.3 to 10.4 kg, averaging 8.0 kg) and sex, and distributed to three groups. Animals in each 
941 
group received 1 ml subcutaneous vaccination in the right side of the neck as follows: 1) live 
942 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine (Salmoporc STM Ch.-B. 022 07 15, IDT 
943 
Biologika, Dessau-Roßlau, Germany) containing 3.32 x 108 CFU per dose, according to the 
944 
product insert); 2) heat-inactivated (65° for 90 minutes) Salmoporc STM vaccine (HKST) using 
945 
  
 
32 
 
the same dose as in 1); 3) saline alone. The live vaccine was administered within 2h of 
946 
reconstitution. The same immunization regimen was repeated as booster injections on day 14. 
947 
Heat-killing of the vaccine was confirmed by absence of bacterial growth on LB plates incubated 
948 
at 37°C for 24h. Throughout the experiment the pigs were housed in two adjoining boxes equally 
949 
mixed across the 3 treatment groups. One pig in the live vaccine group was euthanized on day 19 
950 
of the experiment due to severe umbilical hernia, unrelated to the vaccine. One pig in the control 
951 
group presented on day 0 of the experiment with fever, dyspnea and generalized fatigue, suspected 
952 
of pneumonia, and was therefore treated successfully with 160 mg benzylpenicillin and 200 mg 
953 
dihydrostreptomycin (0.8 ml Streptocillin Vet) over 3 consecutive days. It was excluded from the 
954 
analysis. Five animals per group were included in the final analyses. 
955 
Animals were sacrificed according to regulations. Transverse sections of spleen and prescapular 
956 
lymph node (LN, cervicalis superficialis dorsalis) draining from the injection site were fixated in 
957 
10% neutral-buffered formalin (4% formaldehyde, Pioneer Research Chemicals Ltd) for 
958 
immunohistochemistry. The remaining LN and spleen tissues samples were homogenized using 
959 
disposable scalpels and single-cell suspensions were isolated by forcing homogenized tissue 
960 
samples through a cell strainer (70 µm, Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria), followed by 
961 
two washes with RPMI 1640 and subsequently cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% 
962 
fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% glutamine, 1% HEPES buffer, 1% non-essential amino acids (all from 
963 
Sigma-Aldrich). 
964 
For BCG vaccination 12 female pigs (Danish Landrace/Danish Yorkshire crossbreds and paternal 
965 
Duroc) were delivered after weaning to the research facilities at the National Veterinary Institute, 
966 
Technical University of Denmark, Frederiksberg, Denmark from a commercial farm (Askelygård, 
967 
Roskilde, Denmark). At 5 weeks of age the pigs were stratified by size (total weight range 5.5-
968 
11.5 kg, mean 8.9 kg) and allocated to two vaccination groups, receiving either 1.5-2 vials of BCG 
969 
(Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) resuspended in 0.8ml Sauton diluent (~15-20 
970 
times a standard BCG dose) or 1.0ml Sauton diluent alone, applied by three adjacent injections 
971 
s.c. in the right hind leg by a midwife with extensive experience in BCG vaccination of human 
972 
newborns. 24 days after vaccination, venous blood was collected into EDTA containing tubes, the 
973 
pigs were sacrificed according to regulations, and the spleens were retrieved and preserved in cold 
974 
  
 
33 
 
RPMI-1640 Glutamax supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (all Gibco, city, country) 
975 
for subsequent processing. 
976 
For in vitro experiments reported in Fig. 7 and Supplementary Figure 4 spleens samples were 
977 
collected from German Landrace pigs of both sexes aged between 8 weeks and 1 year. Single cell 
978 
suspensions were prepared as described above.  
979 
Splenocytes were cultured in IMDM (Pan-biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% 
980 
FCS and stimulated with ST, HKST (MOI 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3), LPS (2µg/ml), CL075 (1µg/ml) or  
981 
pLa+RNA (280ng and 237ng respectively) in the presence of Concavalin A (2μg/ml) 
982 
(Fisherscientific, Schwerte, Germany). After one hour penicillin/streptomycin (1%) was added. 
983 
After 4 days cells were restimulated with Phorbol-12-myristat-13-acetat (PMA, 50ng/ml) and 
984 
Ionomycin (1µg/ml, both obtained from Sigma) and then harvested, washed and analyzed by flow 
985 
cytometry. Live and dead cells were discriminated using Zombie Violet Fixable Viability Kit 
986 
(Biolegend), dead cells were excluded from the analysis. 
987 
Immunohistochemistry 
988 
Spleen samples were immersion-fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin, cut in 2 µm sections 
989 
for immunohistochemical analyses after dewaxing in xylene and rehydration in decreasing ethanol 
990 
concentrations. For detection of PAX5, KI67 and BCL22, heat-mediated antigen retrieval was 
991 
performed in 10 mM citric acid (pH 6.0), microwaved at 600 W for 12 min. Spleen sections were 
992 
incubated with a purified mouse antibody monoclonal to PAX5 (1:400, clone 24/Pax5, BD 
993 
Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) or BCL2 (1:100, LS-B2352, LSBio, Seattle, WA, USA) or 
994 
with a purified rabbit antibody monoclonal to KI67 (1:150, clone SP6, Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA, 
995 
USA) at 4°C overnight. Incubation with an irrelevant immuno-purified mouse or rabbit antibody 
996 
at the same dilution served as negative controls. Slides were incubated with biotinylated, secondary 
997 
goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, BA 9200, Vector Burlingame, CA) or goat anti-rabbit IgG  (1:200, 
998 
BA 1000, Vector, Burlingame, CA) antibodies and HRP-coupled streptavidin. Diaminobenzidine 
999 
(DAB) was used as substrate for color development. All slides were counterstained with 
1000 
hematoxylin, dehydrated through graded ethanols, cleared in xylene and coverslipped. Whole slide 
1001 
  
 
34 
 
images of spleen tissues were generated by Aperio CS2 digital pathology scanner (Leica 
1002 
Biosystems Imaging Inc., Vista, CA, USA). 
1003 
Immunoflourescence  
1004 
For immunofluorescent co-staining of PAX5 and KI67, slides were incubated with the purified 
1005 
mouse antibody monoclonal to PAX5 (1:50) over night at 4°C as described above and with Alexa 
1006 
Fluor 568-conjugated, secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
1007 
Darmstad, Germany) for 45 min. at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with a purified 
1008 
rat antibody monoclonal to KI67 (1:100, clone SolA15, eBioscience) at 4°C over night, incubated 
1009 
with Alexa Flour 488-conjugated, secondary goat anti-rat IgG antibody (1:200, Thermo Fisher 
1010 
Scientific) for 45 min. at room temperature and mounted with Roti-Mount Fluor-Care DAPI (4,6-
1011 
diaminidino-2-phenylindole, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Adequate negative controls, 
1012 
including incubation of slides with only one primary but both secondary antibodies, were 
1013 
conducted. Slides were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy with an Olympus BX41 
1014 
microscope equipped with a DP80 camera (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). 
1015 
Case-Control Study 
1016 
Samples of TB patients and healthy volunteers were collected in Mahavir Hospital, Hyderabad 
1017 
(India) and the generated cohort has been described before 83. Informed consent was obtained from 
1018 
all individuals, and all investigations were conducted according to the principles of the Helsinki 
1019 
Declaration. Written approval was obtained from the research ethics board of the Central 
1020 
University of Hyderabad and Mahavir Hospital. Patients were enrolled in the Revised National 
1021 
Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) of India, and recruited into the study on the day of 
1022 
treatment initiation (according to DOTS strategy). HIV-positive and relapse cases were excluded 
1023 
from the cohort. TB diagnosis was based on clinical examination, chest X-Ray, positive sputum 
1024 
test or histopathology. Healthy household contacts of the TB patients were recruited as controls, 
1025 
to ensure comparable exposure rates and environmental conditions. BCG vaccination status was 
1026 
determined by the presence of a BCG-related skin scar. The cohort consisted of 293 patients and 
1027 
165 controls. 61,4% of the TB patients had pulmonary TB (PTB) and 38.6% extra-pulmonary TB 
1028 
(ETB). Controls were significantly older (mean=34.2±9.3) than patients (mean=25.4±10,4;t(456)= 
1029 
8.787;p<0.0001) and had a significantly higher mean BMI (mean=23.8±4.9 and mean=18.0±4.1 
1030 
respectively, t(292.8)=12.995;p<.0001). Gender distribution did not differ significantly between 
1031 
  
 
35 
 
controls (59.4% females) and patients (61.8% females). The age and BMI differences were 
1032 
corrected for using a binary logistic regression model. 
1033 
SNP Analysis  
1034 
DNA of all study subjects was extracted from buccal swabs using FlexiGene DNA extraction Kit 
1035 
(Qiagen). TLR8 SNPs were analyzed by real-time PCR on a Light Cycler instrument (Roche, 
1036 
Mannheim, Germany) using the following PCR primer sets:  
1037 
forward 5’-TCAGGAAGTTAGCCAGTTTCTC-3’, 
1038 
reverse 5’-CCTGCATTTACAGTTGTTTCGAT-3’,  
1039 
sensor 5’-AAATAGAAGTGGCTTACCACGTTTCTG-3’T-FITC, 
1040 
anchor Cy5-5’-TTCTAATTTTTCATTCCGTAACTTGCAGCAGCGCA-3’. 
1041 
Based on previous observations that the presence of an A defines the functionality, we defined the 
1042 
A/AA/AG as TLR8-A, and G/GG as TLR8-G status for our analysis.  
1043 
 
1044 
Statistical Analysis  
1045 
Statistical analyses of in vitro experiments were performed using one-way-ANOVA test and 
1046 
Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test, or 2way-ANOVA, or Wilcoxon’s matched-pairs signed 
1047 
rank test, or linear regression analysis where appropriate. Calculations were performed using 
1048 
GraphPad Prism 6 Software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) 
1049 
For all statistical analysis a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 95% Confidence 
1050 
Intervals are given in squared brackets in tables S3-S4 [CI 95%]. Baseline characteristics of the 
1051 
study population were analyzed using student’s t-test or Pearson's chi-squared (χ²) test. TLR8 allele 
1052 
frequencies were compared using binary logistic regression, summarizing recessive genotypes and 
1053 
adjusting for age, BMI and gender. Interaction between BCG and TLR8-A/G was assessed using 
1054 
Wald’s statistics. Statistical tests were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21 software and 
1055 
figures were generated using GraphPad Prism 6 Software.
