Do the Low WHRs and BMIs Judged Most
Attractive Indicate Higher Fertility?
William D. Lassek1 and Steven J. C. Gaulin1
Abstract
We examine the widely accepted view that very low waist–hip ratios and low body mass indices (BMIs) in women in well-
nourished populations are judged attractive by men because these features reliably indicate superior fertility. In both subsistence
and well-nourished populations, relevant studies of fertility do not support this view. Rather studies indicate lower fertility in
women with anthropometric values associated with high attractiveness. Moreover, low maternal BMI predisposes to conditions
that compromise infant survival. Consistent with these findings from the literature, new data from a large U.S. sample of women
past reproductive age show that women with lower BMIs in the late teens had fewer live births, controlling for education, marital
history, and race. They also had later menarche and earlier menopause compared with women with higher youth BMIs. In
addition, data from the 2013 U.S. natality database show that mothers with lower prepregnancy BMIs have an increased risk of
producing both low-birth-weight and preterm infants controlling for other relevant variables—conditions that would have
adversely affected fitness over almost all of human evolution. Thus, a review of the relevant literature and three new tests fail to
support the view that highly attractive women are more fertile.

Introduction
Compared to the other great apes, male reproductive rate is
slowed in humans due to paternal care; thus, men are expected
to (Clutton-Brock & Vincent, 1991) and do (e.g., Geary, Vigil,
& Byrd-Craven, 2004) exhibit more mate choice than male
chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. Most students of sexual
selection in humans assume that preferred traits reliably indi-
cate reproductive advantages to be gained by selecting mates
exhibiting those traits (e.g., Buss, 1988; Symons, 1979), though
this assumption has been challenged (e.g., Prum, 2017). Two
decades of research have highlighted low waist–hip ratios
(WHRs), small waist sizes, and low body mass indices (BMIs)
as important determinants for women’s bodily attractiveness, at
least in well-nourished populations (see Lassek & Gaulin,
2016, for review and new data). We do not question the exis-
tence of these preferences but want to draw attention to their
alleged evolutionary basis.
Since Singh’s (1993a, 1993b) first studies of female attrac-
tiveness, most researchers in the field have accepted and built
on his argument that women with low WHRs have higher
fertility and better health (Grammer, Fink, Moller, & Thornhill,
2003; Marlowe, Apicella, & Reed, 2005; Pawlowski & Dunbar,
2005; Singh, 1993a, 1993b, 2002, 2006; Singh & Singh, 2011;
Sugiyama, 2005; Weeden & Sabini, 2005). This claim has also
been extended to low BMIs independent of WHR, for example,
“the optimal BMI for health and fertility is struck at around a
value of 18–19” (Tov´
ee, Maisey, Emery, & Cornelissen, 1999).
However, it should be noted that Singh and Young (1995)
acknowledged that women with low BMIs and low WHRs are
less fecund than heavier women with low WHRs, in contrast to
their higher ratings for attractiveness.
Studies in well-nourished populations show that low WHRs
are attractive only when BMIs are low. When the effects of

 BMI, WHR, and waist size (waist/height) are compared, waist
size is the strongest predictor of attractiveness and largely
mediates the relationship of both BMI and WHR to attractive-
ness (Brooks, Shelly, Jordan, & Dixson, 2015; Lassek &
Gaulin, 2016; Rilling, Kaufman, Smith, Worthman, & Patel,
2008). Because waist/height is highly correlated with BMI
(r ¼ .94) in young women (Flegal et al., 2009), studies of
the effects of low BMIs, WHRs, and waist sizes are all
relevant to any claimed relationship of attractiveness to fit-
ness (via health or fertility).
In this article, we examine the “fertility hypothesis,” the
idea that certain body shapes are attractive because they reli-
ably predict higher fertility. (Elsewhere [Lassek & Gaulin,
2018] we have tested—and rejected—the idea that attractive
body shapes signal better health.) Here, we evaluate the wide-
spread claim that the low WHRs and BMIs characteristic of
attractive women in well-nourished populations reliably pre-
dict higher fertility.
Before considering the specific evidence cited in support of
the fertility hypothesis, there are several overriding reasons
why this hypothesis is unlikely to be correct.
To begin with, the low WHRs and BMIs preferred in well-
nourished populations are much smaller than mean or modal
values in young women. Compared with a mean WHR of .74
for typical university undergraduates, the mean of the most
attractive quartile (.72) was 1 standard deviation (SD) lower,
the mean WHR of an average Playboy Playmate (.68) was 2 SD
lower, and the most attractive imaginary female (.39) had a
WHR 5 SDs lower than the mean of college women (Lassek
& Gaulin, 2016). A BMI of 17, preferred in several studies
(Fan, Liu, & Dai, 2004; Grillot, Simmons, Lukaszewski, &
Roney, 2014; Lassek & Gaulin, 2016; Stephen & Perera,
2014), is 3 SDs below the college women’s mean of 22. If such
values reflect optimal fertility, one would expect that they
would be near the center of the WHR and BMI distribution
rather than in the extreme negative tail.
Women with the lower BMIs considered attractive have
reduced amounts of body fat, which is very strongly related
to BMI (r ¼ .96; Bigaard, 2004) and is a source of nutritional
resources critical for survival and reproduction (Caro & Sellen,
1990; Norgan, 1997) including essential fatty acids needed for
brain development (Lassek & Gaulin, 2006, 2008). The per-
centage of body fat in human females is much higher than in
other mammals and primates (Pond, 1998) and much higher in
females than males (Deurenberg, Yap, & Van Staveren, 1998).
Low levels of the fat cell hormone leptin are associated with
amenorrhea and infertility (Christo et al., 2008; Kopp et al.,
1997; Laughlin & Yen, 1997; Miller et al., 1998; Welt et al.,
2004), and women with low BMIs are at risk of hypothalamic
amenorrhea (Christo et al., 2008; Frisch, Wyshak, & Vincent,
1980; Laughlin & Yen, 1997; Stokic, Srdic, & Barak, 2005). In
subsistence populations with seasonal changes in female nutri-
tion and body fat, women are much less likely to conceive
when body fat levels decrease (Bailey et al., 1992; Leslie &
Fry, 1989; Panter-Brick, Lotstein, & Ellison, 1993).
This may help to explain why higher female BMIs are pre-
ferred in several subsistence and forager groups: Shiwiar
(Sugiyama, 2005), Hadza (Wetsman & Marlowe, 1999), Tsi-
mane (Sorokowski, Koscinski, Sorokowska, & Huanca, 2014),
Matsigenka (Yu & Shepard, 1998), Zulu (Tov´
ee, Swami, Furn-
ham, & Mangalparsad, 2006), and in the Gambia (Siervo, Grey,
Nyan, & Prentice, 2006). In a survey of 58 cultures from the
Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (P. J. Brown & Konner, 1987),
men in 81% preferred women who were “plump or fat,” con-
sistent with an earlier survey (Ford & Beach, 1951). Similarly,
a review of 144 studies found that higher BMIs were judged
positively in developing societies (Sobal & Stunkard, 1989). In
a separate study of 54 cultures, the preference for plumper
women was significantly stronger in those that experience
higher levels of nutritional stress (Anderson, Crawford,
Nadeau, & Lindberg, 1992).
Women in such forager and subsistence populations tend to
have low BMIs in the range of 17–20 and low levels of body
fat (Bribiescas, 2001; Howell, 2000, 2010; K. L. Kramer &
Greaves, 2010; Leonard, 2008; Norgan, 1994; Nyak, 2014;
Remis & Jost Robinson, 2014; Sharrock et al., 2008; Sherry
& Marlowe, 2007; Sugiyama, 2005; Wheatley et al., 2014). In
contrast with the pattern in well-nourished women (see
below), women’s BMIs tend to remain low and often fall with
age and parity (Garner, Smith, Beae, Lai, & Heywood, 1994;
Jellife & Maddocks, 1964; H. G. Norgan, Ferro-Luzzi, &
Durkin, 1974; Tracer, 1991; Ventkachatalam, 1962; Wheatley
et al., 2014), suggesting that reproductively relevant fat
resources are depleted by reproduction (see Lassek & Gaulin,
2006).
This may help to explain why a positive linear relationship
between BMI and total fertility has been found in all of those
subsistence populations where it has been studied, including
Hadza, Ache, and Agta hunter-gatherers (Hill & Hurtado,
1996; Marlowe, 2004a; Page et al., 2016), and horticultural-
ists in Papua New Guinea (Brush, Boyce, & Harrison, 1983),
the Columbian Andes (Mueller, 1979), and rural Gambia
(Courtiol et al., 2013; Sear, Mace, & McGregor, 2003).
A study of 22 subsistence societies found that average adult
body weight was strongly correlated with reproductive fitness
(Hochberg, Gawlik, & Walker, 2011). Thus, women with
higher BMIs than are typical in their populations tend to have
more children.
In well-nourished populations, the low BMIs and WHRs
considered attractive are most likely to occur in women
younger than age 20 (Al-Sendi, Shetty, & Musaiger, 2003;
Bacopoulou, Efthymiou, Landis, Rentoumis, & Chrousos,
2015; Casey et al., 1994; Fredriks, Buuren, Fekkes, Verloove
Vanhorick, & Wit, 2005; Gillum, 1999; Haas, Liepold, &
Schwandt, 2011; Kahn & Cheng, 2008; Kelishadi et al.,
2007; Kimm et al., 2005; Martinez, Devesa, Bacallao, & Ama-
dor, 1994; Moreno et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2010; Westrate,
Deurenberg, & Tintern, 1989), and this is an age-group which
has long been known to have decreased likelihood of conceiv-
ing (fecundability; Ashley-Montagu, 1939). The frequency of
anovulatory cycles is 80–90% in the year after menarche
2
Evolutionary Psychology
 (Loucks, 2006), 70% at 5 years after menarche, and 40% in
women aged 20–24 (Apter, 1980; Ellison, Lager, & Calfee,
1987; Loucks, 2006; Metcalf & Mackenzie, 1980). Anovula-
tory cycles reach a minimum frequency (10–20%) only in the
age range of 25–29, when the ovaries fully mature (Doring,
1969; Ellison et al., 1987; Loucks, 2006). As a result, fecund-
ability increases from .20 per menstrual cycle at age 15 to .36 at
age 20 and peaks at .40 at age 25 (Weinstein, Wood, Soto, &
Greenfield, 1990). Consistent with these findings, age-specific
fertility rates in three hunter-gatherer groups were lowest in the
teens and highest in women in their late 20s and early 30s
(Pennington, 2001). Men seeking mates with maximum
fecundity should prefer women in their late 20s who are likely
to have higher BMIs than those in their teens.
The limited evidence which has previously been offered to
support the fertility hypothesis, drawn exclusively from well-
nourished populations, emphasizes the decreased fecundability
of women with high WHRs or BMIs, but such evidence cannot
be used to support the claim that the very low BMIs and WHRs
associated with attractiveness in such populations indicate
higher fertility. To explain such preferences, it would be nec-
essary to show that the unusually low values judged to be
highly attractive predict higher fertility than do mean or modal
values of BMI and/or WHR. As discussed below, we have been
unable to find any studies that support such a claim.
WHR and Fertility
The studies cited in support of the idea that low WHRs indicate
better fertility (Table 1) have focused on fecundability, which
depends of ovulation. In ovulatory cycles, follicle-stimulating
hormone stimulates the development of ovarian follicles and
the secretion of increasing amounts of estradiol by ovarian
theca cells. When estradiol reaches its peak, there is a surge
of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary; and the follicle
releases its egg. LH then stimulates the secretion of progester-
one from the releasing follicle (corpus luteum), which prepares
the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized egg. Thus,
cycles in which conception occurs are associated with higher
estradiol and progesterone levels (Lipson & Ellison, 1996; Li
et al., 2001; Lu, Bentley, Gann, Hodges, & Chatterton, 1999;
Venners et al., 2006). None of the studies cited to support the
fertility hypothesis show that the very low WHRs found most
attractive have higher fecundability than mean or modal values.
In vitro fertilization studies which have been cited (of ques-
tionable ecological validity) all use very high cut points, divid-
ing women into high- and low-WHR groups at either .80 or .85
(Van Noord-Zaadstra, Seidell, Vrieswijk, & Noord, 1991;
Wass, Waldenstrom, Rossner, & Hellberg, 1997; Zaadstra
et al., 1993). Likewise, a claim that low WHRs are associated
with more ovulatory cycles is based on a WHR cut point of .85
(Moran et al., 1999). These cut points are much higher than
mean WHRs in young women (0.74–75).
Thus, the supposedly “low-WHR” categories in these stud-
ies included the mean and mode, as well as many values above
these midpoints. Any falloff in fertility in women with very
high WHRs may make such comparisons statistically signifi-
cant but does not demonstrate high fertility at very low
WHRs. Such analysis cannot reveal the fertility of women
at the extreme low end of the WHR distribution—the data
that are relevant to understanding why such women are
judged as most attractive. Only studies using smaller bin
sizes could do that.
Because ovulatory cycles are have higher estradiol and pro-
gesterone levels, levels of these hormones (measured at various
times during the menstrual cycle) are often used as proxies for
fecundability. Although progesterone levels are a better indi-
cator of ovulation, the studies cited have used estrogen, and
none of these studies show enhanced fecundability in women
with low WHRs.
One such study frequently cited to show that low WHRs
indicate enhanced fertility (Jasienska, Ziomkiewicz, Ellison,
Lipson, & Thune, 2004) compared salivary estradiol levels in
the quartile having the lowest WHR (mean ¼ .669) with the
highest WHR quartile (mean ¼ .795) in a Polish sample and
found that the quartile with the lowest WHRs had significantly
higher estradiol than did the highest quartile. However, a dif-
ference between high and low quartiles does not show that the

 most attractive WHRs are associated with higher estradiol (and
presumed fertility) than mean or modal values.
Fortunately, in another study of Polish women (Ziomkie-
wicz, Ellison, Lipson, Thune, & Jasienska, 2008), more com-
plete data were available. A similar group of young women
were divided into four quartiles based on body fat, which in
other studies is very strongly correlated with BMI (r ¼ .94;
Bigaard et al., 2004) and waist size (r ¼ .84; Flegal et al.,
2009). Mean WHR increased monotonically across the quar-
tiles of body fat, from .70 in the lowest quartile to .75 in the
highest. And while women in this lowest quartile had higher
mid-cycle estradiol than those in the highest quartile (as in
Jasienska et al., 2004), they had significantly lower estradiol
than women in the two middle quartiles (with mean WHRs
of .71 and .72). Thus, the quartile of women with the lowest
WHRs and body fat levels had hormonal indicators of lower
fertility than half of the women in the sample. For all
women with less than 30.8% body fat—representing 75%
of the sample—estradiol showed a positive linear relation to
body fat. Thus, in all but the heaviest quartile, lower WHR
and lower percentage body fat were associated with lower
estradiol and—by the standard assumption used to claim
high fertility for women with low WHRs (Lipson & Ellison,
1996; Li et al., 2012; Lu et al., 1999; Venners et al.,
2006)—with likely lower fertility.
Several other studies in premenopausal women have found
higher estradiol levels in women with higher WHRs or waist
circumferences (Astrup et al., 1992; Emaus et al., 2008;
Finstad et al., 2009; Kirchengast, 1993), or no relationship
between estradiol levels and body shape (Grillot et al.,
2014; Lamon-Fava et al., 2005; Verkasalo, Thomas, Appleby,
Davey, & Key, 2001).
Studies of time-to-pregnancy may be better indicators of the
effects of WHR on fecundability. In two studies, there was no
significant difference in time-to-pregnancy even for WHRs
over .85 and .88 (McKinnon et al., 2016; Sundaram, Mumford,
& Buck, 2017). In one other study (Wise, Palmer, & Rosen-
berg, 2013), there was a significant increase in time-to-
pregnancy only for WHRs > .85, again a cut point that fails
to adequately test the fertility hypothesis.
Despite the negative evidence considered above, perhaps
WHR could track variation in fecundability in adolescent
women as reflected in the menstrual cycle. Fortunately, this
possibility has been tested in four studies of adolescents. Three
of these studies, with a total N of 3,107 females aged 15–18,
focused on symptoms linked to reduced fecundability, such as
oligomenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles. Such symptoms
are common in women who fail to ovulate, as may occur in
polycystic ovary syndrome (Fessler, Natterson-Horowitz, &
Azziz, 2016; Singh, 1993a, 1993b). These studies found no
WHR differencein thosewith regularcyclescomparedwith those
with oligomenorrhea or irregular menses (van Hooff, Voorhorst,
Kaptein, & Hirasing, 1999; van Hooff et al., 2000a, 2000b). Simi-
larly, in a sample of 299 Canadian adolescents, there was no
relationship between WHR and hormonal evidence of ovulation
(Bond, Vella, Kiparissis, & Wynne-Edwards, 2006). These
studies indicate that men cannot use a low WHR to select a young
woman with higher potential fertility.
Do Low BMIs Signal High Fertility?
The claim that low BMIs of 17–19 are attractive because they
signal higher fertility is even more problematic than the parallel
claim for WHR because there is consistent data for subsistence
populations showing decreased fertility at lower BMIs, as
noted above, while studies in well-nourished populations gen-
erally show an inverted U-shaped relationship between BMI
and fertility, with maximal fertility at BMIs in the range of
21–25, and decreased fertility in women with both lower and
higher BMIs, suggesting stabilizing selection on women’s
BMI. (Importantly, the higher BMIs associated with decreased
fertility in well-nourished populations are rare in subsistence
populations.)
In women trying to conceive, those with BMIs < 20 have an
increased risk of infertility (Grodstein, Goldman, & Kramer,
1994; Rich-Edwards, Goldman, Willet, Hunter, & Stampfer,
1994). In a case–control study of ovulatory infertility in a sam-
ple of more than 100,000 American women who were trying to
conceive, rates of infertility were already significantly elevated
at a BMI of 20 and at a BMI of 17.5 were twice as high as in
women with modal BMIs (Rich-Edwards et al., 2002) as shown
in Figure 1.
Women with low BMIs also tend to have increased time-to-
pregnancy and decreased fecundability ratios (Bolumar, Olsen,
Rebagliato, Saez-Lioret, & Bisanti, 2000; Jensen, Scheike,
Keiding, Schaumburg, & Grandjean, 1999; Kaplan, Hooper,
Stieglitz, & Gurven, 2015; Lake, Power, & Cole, 1997; Wise
et al., 2010), although the lower values for low BMIs were not
significant in some studies (Koivunen et al., 2008; McKinnon
et al., 2016; Polotsky et al., 2010; Wise et al., 2013), probably
because of the small number of women in the low-BMI group.
As was true for lower WHRs, the average estradiol levels of
women with low BMIs tend to be lower than those of
women with higher BMIs (Emaus et al., 2008; Ivandic,
Prpic-Krizzevac, Mulcic, & Juric, 1998; Yeung et al., 2013;
Ziomkiewicz et al., 2008). In addition, in a study of the men-
strual patterns of 2,243 adolescent women, irregular cycles
were associated with lower BMIs (van Hooff et al., 1998).
Especially relevant to issues of mate choice are studies that
explore the relationship between adolescent BMI and subse-
quent fertility, although use of contraception in modern popu-
lations may obscure the effects of interest. Most studies show
that young women with BMIs < 20 subsequently have fewer
children (Dawson, Dhurandhar, Vazquez, Peng, & Allison,
2013; Jacobsen, Knutsen, Oda, & Fraser, 2013; Jokela et al.,
2007, 2008). In one study based on recalled weight at 18 (Paw-
lowski, Boothroyd, Perrett, & Kluska, 2008), there was no
correlation between parity and youth BMI.
Women with lower BMIs may also have a shorter reproduc-
tive span between menarche and menopause. Young women
with lower BMIs are more likely to have later menarche
(Ayatollahi, Dowlatabadi, & Ayatollahi, 2002; Cagas & Riley,

1998; Mul et al., 2001; Oettle & Higginson, 1961; Zacharias
& Wurtman, 1969), whereas those with higher leptin levels
(reflecting more body fat) have earlier menarche (Matkovic
et al., 1997). At the other end of the reproductive span, meno-
pause tends to occur later in women with higher BMIs (Para-
zzini & PMIS Group, 2007).
The duration of postpartum and lactational amenorrhea
is also shorter in women with higher BMIs or more body fat
(Fink et al., 1992; Heinig, Nommsen-Rivers, Peerson, &
Dewey, 1994; Tennekoon, Wasalathanthri, Jeevathayaparan,
& Karunanayake, 2005), allowing shorter interbirth intervals.
Thus, in all cases, low BMIs are associated with poorer fertility,
Lower Maternal WHRs and BMIs Predict Poorer Infant
Survival
Reproductive success depends not only on fecundability and
successful parturition but also on survival of offspring to repro-
ductive age. In subsistence populations, infant survival appears
to be a much more important factor in female reproductive
success than fecundability (K. L. Kramer, 2008; Pennington,
1992). A survey of 19 hunter-gather groups found that 44% of
infants born alive died within the first 15 years of life (Mar-
lowe, 2005).
In the subsistence populations that have been studied,
women with higher BMIs have more surviving offspring than
those with lower BMIs, including samples in Nepal (Panter-
Brick et al., 1993), Papua New Guinea (Brush et al., 1983), the
Columbian Andes (Paul, Mueller & Whitehead, 1979), Hadza
hunter-gatherers (Hiernaux & Hartono, 1980; Marlowe,
2004a), Turkana pastoralists (Pike, 2000), and !Kung (Penning-
ton, 1992; Reid & Vugt, 1987; Wilmsen, 1978). In a sample of
mothers in Bangladesh, the risk of a child dying was inversely
related to the mother’s height and weight (Baqui, Arifeen,
Amin, & Black, 1994).
In apparent recognition of this relationship, young women in
subsistence groups may be allowed extra food and/or reduced
workload to maximize the amount of body fat before marriage
(P. J. Brown & Konner, 1987; K. L. Kramer, Greaves, &
Ellison, 2009). These reproductive advantages for higher BMIs
may also help to explain why men in several subsistence popu-
lations prefer women with higher BMIs (Siervo et al., 2006;
Sorokowski et al., 2014; Sugiyama, 2005; Tov´
ee et al., 2006;
Wetsman & Marlowe, 1999; Yu & Shepard, 1998).
In well-nourished populations, the same patterns hold: Low
BMIs and smaller waist sizes in women who do conceive are
strongly correlated with poorer outcomes for their infants.
Infant birth weight has a strong positive linear relationship with
prepregnancy BMI (Abrams & Laros, 1986; Allen, Lungaho,
Harrison, Neuman, & Kirksey, 1994; Ay et al., 2009; Neggers
& Goldenberg, 2003; Neggers, Goldenberg, Cliver, Hoffman,
& Cutter, 1995), and with its correlates, WHR and waist size
(D. E. Brown, Koenig, Demorales, McGuire, & Mersai, 1996;
Li et al., 2012; McCarthy, Strauss, Walker, & Permezel, 2004;
Salem, Adler, Lee, & Smith, 2012; Wendland, Duncan, Men-
gue, Nucci, & Schmidt, 2007a).
Mothers with lower prepregnancy BMIs and smaller waists
have an increased risk of having smaller, lower weight babies
(Abrams & Newman, 1991; Bhattacharya, Campbell, Liston, &
Bhattacharya, 2007; Cogswell & Yip, 1995; Edwards, Alton,
Barrada, & Hakanson, 1979; Kalk et al., 2009; Leung et al.,
2008; Murakami et al., 2005; Nandi & Nelson, 1992; Neggers
et al., 1995) and an increased risk of having premature infants
(Edwards et al., 1979; M. S. Kramer et al., 1995; Leung et al.,
2008; Murakami et al., 2005; Wen, Goldenberg, Cutter,
Hoffman, & Cliver, 1990).
A meta-analysis found that, for mothers with a prepreg-
nancy BMI < 20 (i.e., in the most attractive range), the risk
of producing a low-birth-weight infant was 1.7 times greater
than for those with a BMI of 20–24 (Han, Mulla, Beyene, Liao,
& McDonald, 2011). The consequences are substantial because
15–20% of mothers with BMI < 20 have low-birth-weight
infants (Ehrenberg, Dierker, Milluzzi, & Mercer, 2003; Ogu-
nyemi, Hullet, Leeper, & Risk, 1998). In young women with
BMIs less than 18.5, which would include half of Playboy
Playmates (Lassek & Gaulin, 2016), low-birth-weight rates can
exceed 50% (Rao et al., 2001).

 Another study investigated the relationship between fetal
growth and prepregnancy weight, which is highly correlated
(r ¼ .94) with prepregnancy BMI. The risk of retarded fetal
growth and prematurity was 3 times higher in mothers weigh-
ing less than 50 kg compared with those weighing 73 kg or
more (Wen et al., 1990). Children of mothers with lower pre-
pregnancy weights are also smaller and lighter at 7 years of age
(Garn & Keating, 1980).
There may also be intergenerational effects: Women who
weighed less at birth have more difficulty conceiving (Wild-
enschild et al., 2015) and are more likely to have poorer preg-
nancy outcomes when they have children (Hackman, Emanuel,
van Belle, & Daling, 1983), as well as shorter life spans (Baker,
Olsen, & Sorensen, 2008).
The lower birth weights and increased prematurity asso-
ciated with lower maternal BMIs result in higher infant
death rates, even with modern pediatric care (Baqui et al.,
1994; Cogswell & Yip, 1995; Tennant, Rankin, & Bell,
2011). For example, a 2001 study in England found that the
mothers with the lowest infant mortality had a prepregnancy
BMI of 23, whereas mothers with prepregnancy BMIs < 18.5
had infant mortality rates more than twice as high (Tennant
et al., 2011). Low-birth-weight infants are much more
likely to die during childhood than normal-weight infants
(McCormick, 1985), especially in poorly nourished popula-
tions (Puffer & Serano, 1973).
In summary, the available evidence does not support the
idea that low WHRs and BMIs predict higher fertility or pos-
itive reproductive outcomes. On the contrary, these studies
(including some of those often cited as evidence in favor of
the health-and-fertility hypothesis) support the view that BMI
and WHR are subject to stabilizing selection in well-nourished
populations: Mean or modal values are associated with max-
imal fertility. In less well-nourished subsistence populations,
fertility and child survival outcomes may well generate positive
directional selection across the entire range of actual BMI and
waist size. Under either of these circumstances, it is difficult to
explain a strong male preference for low female BMIs and
WHRs based on observed patterns of fertility.
New Tests of BMI and Fertility
To supplement the substantial published evidence against the
fertility hypothesis, we offer three new tests in large samples
of American women: the relationship between youth BMI
with subsequent parity and the age of menarche and meno-
pause in a sample of women with limited access to oral con-
traceptives and the relationship between prepregnancy BMI
and pregnancy outcomes for 3.1 million births. We make the
following predictions:
Prediction 1: In a large sample of American women past
reproductive age, those who had higher BMIs as young
women will have more children than those who had lower
BMIs as young women, controlling for other relevant
variables.
Prediction 2: In a large sample of American women,
youth BMI will be negatively related to the age at
menarche and positively related to the age at menopause
and reproductive span.
Prediction 3: American mothers who have prepregnancy
BMIs < 20 will have a greater risk of giving birth to preterm
and low-birth-weight infants.
Method
Relationship of Minimum BMI After Age 18 to Achieved
Fertility (Prediction 1)
From the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey conducted in 1971–1975 (NHANES I), we selected the
3,164 American women over age 44 who had reported their
total number of live births and all relevant predictors (below).
Their youth BMI was calculated from their self-reported lowest
weight after age 18 and their current stature. For most women,
the lowest weight occurred between ages 18 and 22.
To explore whether BMI early in the reproductive career
might be a unique predictor of eventual fertility, we used mul-
tiple regression with total live births as the dependent variable
and youth BMI, current age, ever-married status, years of edu-
cation, family income, use of oral contraceptives, race (White,
Black, and Other treated as three dummy variables), and age at
minimum BMI as potential predictors.
In addition, regression was used to calculate the number of
residual live births after controlling for the significant covari-
ates from the previous regression. We then explored whether
women who had BMIs in the attractive range (<20) had more
residual live births than women with higher BMIs, as might be
expected if young women in this range would eventually
achieve higher fertility.
Some women past reproductive age who have been married
and have no children may have experienced difficulty conceiv-
ing, and this outcome could also be related to youth BMI.
Among 2,910 ever-married women over age 44 in the
NHANES I, 396 had no live births. The youth BMI for this
zero-parity group was compared with the youth BMI for
women with one or more live births and the relationship to
youth BMI was determined by logistic regression, controlling
for the original set of covariates.
Relationship of Minimum BMI After Age 18 With Age at
Menarche and Menopause (Prediction 2)
The NHANES I sample (1971–1975) was also used to estimate
the relationship of youth BMI to the age at menarche in 7,757
postmenarcheal women, to age at menopause in 2,965 postme-
nopausal women, and to their difference (reproductive span) in
2,926 postmenopausal women. In separate regressions—one
for each of the three life history variables—we controlled for
current age, age at minimum weight, race, family income, years
of education (except in the age-at-menarche regression),
and parity.

Evolutionary Psychology
 Risk of Pregnancy Complications in Relation to
Prepregnancy BMI (Prediction 3)
Natality data from U.S. birth certificates for 3,122,133 single-
ton births in 2013 were used to determine the relationship of
prepregnancy BMI to the occurrence of low birth weight and
preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation). In this data set, control
variables included maternal age, race (White, Black, Native
American, and Asian), and Hispanic ethnicity treated as a cate-
gorical variables, weight gain (kg) per month of gestation,
cigarette smoking, and years of education. Prepregnancy BMI
was calculated from maternal stature and self-reported prepreg-
nancy weight as recorded on the birth certificate. Logistic
regression was used for analysis with age groups and BMI
treated as categorical variables with BMI groups of <20,
20–24, 25–29, and with 30þ used as the reference level.
Results
Prediction 1: In a large sample of American women past
reproductive age, those who had higher BMIs as young
women will have more children than those who had lower
BMIs as young women, controlling for other relevant
variables.
Higher youth BMIs predicted higher rather than lower fertility
in a sample of 3,164 American women over 44 years of age in
the NHANES I. Women’s lowest BMI after age 18 was posi-
tively correlated with their total number of live births
(r ¼ þ.078, p < .001). This effect could be spurious, due to
other correlated variables. However, as shown in Table 2, in
regression with current age, race, years of education,
ever-married status, age at lowest weight after age 18, oral
contraceptive use, and family income, youth BMI was still a
significant positive predictor (b ¼ þ.057, p ¼ .001) of numbers
of live births. Of these 3,164 women, who were over 44 years
of age when sampled in 1971–1975, only 3.5% had ever used
oral contraceptives, and oral contraceptive use was not a sig-
nificant predictor of parity when added to the regression. For
7,212 women aged 14–49, current BMI was also positively
related to the number of live births (b ¼ þ.097, p < .001), with
the same control variables.
Table 3 shows the number of residual live births, grouped
by youth BMI, after adjustment for age, education, marital
status, and race. Residual live births were highest in those with
youth BMIs of 25–29, and women with youth BMIs less than
20 had significantly fewer residual live births than women with
higher BMIs. The number of residual live births adjusted for
age, education, marital status, and race was �0.160 + 2.28 for
youth BMIs < 20 versus 0.089 + 2.67 for youth BMIs of 20 or
more (t ¼ 2.83, p ¼ .005).
Finally, youth BMI failed to predict which women over 44
would be childless in the NHANES I sample. The youth BMI of
the 396 women with no children (21.02 + 3.89) was not sig-
nificantly different from the youth BMI of the 2,514 women
with children (20.84 + 3.27, p ¼ .329). Moreover, in a logistic
regression with age, education, family income, marital status,
and race as covariates, youth BMI was not a significant pre-
dictor of having any children (p ¼ .867).
Prediction 2: In a large sample of American women, youth
BMI will be negatively related to the age at menarche and
positively related to the age at menopause and reproductive
span.
Youth BMI was negatively related to the age of menarche
(r ¼ �.095) and positively related to the age of menopause
(r ¼ .104) and to their difference (r ¼ .129, all p < .001). The
mean age of menarche in women with a youth BMI less than
20 was 13.10 + 1.59 versus 12.84 + 1.67 in those with 20þ
(F ¼ 2.52, p < .001), while the mean age of menopause was
44.34 + 7.93 versus 45.74 + 7.35 (F ¼ 16.7, p < .001).
Reproductive span was 30.84 + 7.86 versus 32.56 + 7.39
years (F ¼ 9.22, p < .001).
Table 4 shows significant multiple regression results con-
trolling for current age, age at minimum weight, family
income, education, race, and parity (for menopause and repro-
ductive span). Women with higher youth BMIs had signifi-
cantly earlier menarche, later menopause, and a longer
reproductive span.
As found in other studies (see above), higher current BMIs
predicted older age and higher parity. In 6,926 women aged
15–49 from the NHANES I sample, current BMI was positively
correlated with both age (r ¼ .226) and parity (r ¼ .255,
p < .001). The mean BMI for those 15–19 was 22.11 + 4.57

p < .001). When regressed together, both age (b ¼ .125) and
parity (b ¼ .188) predicted BMI (r2 ¼ .076).
Prediction 3: American women giving birth to their first
child who have prepregnancy BMIs < 20 will have a greater
risk of giving birth to preterm and low-birth-weight infants.
To avoid confounds associated with multiple births, the
2013 U.S. Natality data set was restricted to the 3,122,133
women with singleton births. In this group, mother’s prepreg-
nancy BMI was positively related to infant birth weight
(r ¼ .089, p < .001), and women with lower BMIs were at
increased risk of producing low-birth-weight infants and of
preterm delivery. The percentage of low-birth-weight deliv-
eries for mothers with BMIs < 20 was 9.2% versus 5.8% for
BMIs of 20þ, while the risk of preterm neonates was 10.7%
versus 9.3%, respectively (z ¼ 69.5 and 24.3, both ps < .001).
Table 5 shows the results of two multiple logistic regres-
sions predicting low birth weight or preterm delivery—with
maternal age-groups, race categories, Hispanic ethnicity, years
of education, weight gain per week of gestation, and cigarette
smoking used as predictors along with prepregnancy BMI.
Women with BMI < 20 were at much greater risk of producing
a low-birth-weight infant and at increased risk of preterm deliv-
ery compared to those with BMIs of 20 or more. Using the
same covariates with linear regression, BMI was positively
related to birth weight (b ¼ .134, p < .001); heavier mothers
had heavier newborns.
Since younger mothers had a greater risk of producing a
low-birth-weight infant, lower BMIs in younger women and
higher BMIs in older women (who are less likely to have
low-birth-weight infants) could account for much of the overall
relationship between BMI and low-birth-weight outcomes.
However, as illustrated in Figure 2, women with BMIs < 20
are substantially more likely to produce a low-birth-weight
infant in every age-group.
Discussion
A detailed review of relevant studies found none supporting the
view that the low WHRs and BMIs men find most attractive in
well-nourished populations indicate better fertility. Instead, in
all studies showing a statistically significant effect, these
attractive body shapes are associated with low fertility. This

Evolutionary Psychology
 applies to all of the key elements of female reproductive suc-
cess: reproductive span, fecundability, live births, and infant
survival. These findings are consistent with studies in subsis-
tence populations which consistently show that fertility and the
number of offspring surviving childhood increase linearly with
increasing BMI.
New data presented here show that, contrary to the prevail-
ing “fertility hypothesis”—but consistent with other studies
(Dawson et al., 2013; Jacobsen et al., 2013; Jokela et al., 2007,
2008)—low BMIs in young American women predicted lower
rather than higher lifetime fertility: As predicted, women with
low BMIs in early adulthood had fewer subsequent live births
than those with higher youth BMIs. This was true regardless
of whether live births were adjusted for age, education, family
income, marital status, oral contraceptive use, and race, for
age alone, or unadjusted. Low BMI early in the reproductive
period—when mateships tend to be formed—was a signifi-
cant negative, not positive, predictor of eventual reproduc-
tive success. There was no relationship between youth BMI
and nulliparity.
It might be argued that low BMIs are preferred not because
they predict higher future fertility but because they reflect
higher achieved fertility. However, in well-nourished popula-
tions, BMI increases with parity (as found in the NHANES I
sample). Thus, lower current BMIs reflect lower achieved fer-
tility. In other words, this version of the fertility hypothesis also
fails to fit the data.
The positive relationship of youth BMI to parity may be
related to the earlier age at menarche and later age at meno-
pause in women with higher youth BMIs in our sample, as also
found in other studies (Ayatollahi et al., 2002; Cagas & Riley,
1970; Kaplowitz et al., 2001; Mandel et al., 2004; Morabia &
Costanza, 1998; Mul et al., 2001; Oettle & Higginson, 1961;
Parazzini & PMIS Group, 2007; Zacharias & Wurtman, 1969).
Not only do young women with higher BMIs go on to have
more children, their children have attributes that make them
more likely to survive. The risk of having a low-birth-weight or
preterm infant (who are at higher risk of infant mortality) was
substantially elevated in mothers with prepregnancy BMI < 20.
Even with modern neonatal intensive care, low-birth-weight
and preterm infants are less likely to survive infancy. In the
2013 birth cohort, low-birth-weight infants were 31 times more
likely to die in their first year than normal-weight infants, and
preterm infants were 18 times more likely to die than full-term
infants. The death rate would be much higher were modern,
specialized care not available (i.e., during much of human evo-
lution), and any tendency to produce infants with shorter gesta-
tions and/or low birth weights presumably would have had a
serious impact on women’s reproductive success in the past, as
suggested by the positive relationship between BMI and repro-
ductive success in subsistence populations.
The optimal maternal age range for birth weights above
2,500 g was 25–29, the same as the age range for peak fecund-
ability (see Introduction). If men had evolved to prefer women
with high fertility, they should prefer women with BMIs
between 20 and 29 who are between 25 and 29 years old.
In a companion paper (Lassek & Gaulin, 2018), we have
shown that the other half of the health-and-fertility hypoth-
esis—that women with smaller waists and lower BMIs have
better health—is also likely to be incorrect. However, better
health was predicted by younger age.
But if the most attractive women do not have better health
and fertility, why should selection have programmed men to
find them attractive? One possibility arises from the observa-
tion that women’s BMI and WHR are reliable predictors of age.
In well-nourished populations, WHR and BMI are lowest in
adolescents and then increase monotonically. In subsistence
populations in which men prefer higher than average BMIs,
higher values also indicate a younger age, since BMI tends to
decrease with age. Thus, well-nourished women with the small
waists and low BMIs that men find most attractive are likely to
be young but postpubertal and therefore to have high reproduc-
tive value (sensu; Fisher, 1930). Even though these younger
women have reduced current fecundability and a decreased
likelihood of infant survival, they have maximal long-term
reproductive potential (Andrews, Lukazweski, Simmons, &
Bleske-Recheck, 2017; Symons, 1979).
Limitations
Despite our use of appropriate search terms that yielded many
studies relevant to the relationship between female anthropo-
metric measures and fertility, there may be others that were
missed. However, our methods should have discovered studies
in a manner that was unbiased with respect to whether they
supported or undermined the fertility hypothesis. With respect
to most combinations of our dependent and independent mea-
sures, there are multiple studies that agree in contradicting the
fertility hypothesis.
Our new analyses of the effects of waist size, WHR, and
BMI on fertility, based on recent representative samples of
American women, may not reflect conditions in the environ-
ment of evolutionary adaptiveness. However, (1) our new anal-
yses do derive from the kind of Westernized population that has
provided most of the evidence that allegedly supports the fer-
tility hypothesis, (2) due to the availability of food and medical
care, these populations should suffer fewer costs associated
with low levels of female body fat, which should make it more
difficult to reject the fertility hypothesis. It should also be noted
that there is a general concordance between the results in these
samples and data from subsistence populations.
The availability of modern contraception obviously has a
profound impact on family size and the number of live births,
but the population chosen for analysis (in Prediction 1) had
very low access to and usage of oral contraception during their
fertile years. Different rates of use of other methods of contra-
ception should make it more difficult to discern the effects of
youth BMI on fertility, so that effects detected here, controlling
for a number of other variables related to fertility, may merit
some consideration.
The analysis of youth BMI and age at menopause could be
influenced by women whose menopause was due to surgery,
Lassek and Gaulin
9
 since women with hysterectomies were not identified in the
NHANES I database. However, there does not appear to be
any known relationship between youth BMI and the likelihood
of a hysterectomy.
The lowest weights after age 18 and prepregnancy weights
were self-reported and also subject to the vagaries of recall; and
although recalled weights correlate strongly with actual
weights, they are subject to biases (Lassek & Gaulin, 2018;
Must et al., 2002). The lowest weights after 18 also occurred
at different ages, although most were within 5 years of age 18;
to deal with this issue, the age of minimal weight was used as a
covariate in the analyses. Also, youth BMIs were computed
using current heights. However, there does not seem to be any
reason why such factors should systematically skew the anal-
ysis of current health or the number of live births in ways that
would systematically disadvantage the fertility hypothesis.
The 2013 U.S. natality data used to test Prediction 3 come
from a population with high rates of overweight and obesity,
and this could possibly influence the validity of the results.
However, there is no apparent reason why overweight or obese
mothers should have better outcomes in this population than in
others, and the relationship found between BMI and low-birth-
weight and prematurity is consistent with other studies in dif-
ferent samples. Mothers also tend to be older in recent samples
than in the past, but this was addressed by controlling for age.
Conclusion
A detailed review and three new tests of the relationship of
women’s WHRs and BMIs with elements of reproductive suc-
cess failed to uncover any evidence that the anthropometric
values that men find most attractive in well-nourished popula-
tions indicate enhanced fertility; instead, they show diminished
fertility. These findings are congruent with studies in subsis-
tence populations which show decreased reproductive success
in women with lower BMIs. It may be time to consider other
possible reasons for male preferences.
