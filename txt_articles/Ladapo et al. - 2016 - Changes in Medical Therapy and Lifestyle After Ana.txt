Background-—Diagnostic testing in the care of patients newly presenting with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease
may influence risk factor management, independent of test type or test results. However, little is known about changes in
medications and lifestyle after anatomical or functional testing.
Methods and Results-—We examined what factors influenced preventive medical therapy and lifestyle practices at 60 days among
10 003 symptomatic patients (53% women; mean age 61 years) randomly assigned to anatomical testing with coronary computed
tomographic angiography or functional testing (NCT01174550). We also assessed the association of preventive changes with
major cardiovascular events. There were no differences in medications/lifestyle at baseline. At 60 days, relative to baseline, the
computed tomographic angiography strategy was associated with a higher proportion of patients newly initiating aspirin (11.8%
versus 7.8%), statins (12.7% versus 6.2%), and b-blockers (8.1% versus 5.3%), compared to functional testing (P<0.0001 for each).
No significant differences between computed tomographic angiography and functional testing strategies were observed for
initiation of exercise, quitting smoking, or weight loss in overweight/obese patients, though overall prevalence of healthy eating
was higher after computed tomographic angiography (P=0.002) while obese/overweight status was lower (P=0.040). Positive
initial test results and revascularization demonstrated stronger associations with preventive medications and lifestyle than test
type. Medication initiation was not associated with fewer cardiovascular events.
Conclusions-—Positive initial test results and revascularization are primary drivers of changes in preventive medical and lifestyle
practices, with test type making secondary contributions. However, substantial opportunities exist to further reduce cardiovascular risk.

 changes in modifiable risk factors, independent of test
results. However, little is known about changes in medical
management and lifestyle after diagnostic testing for suspected
CAD,3–9 and few studies have examined how these changes
may relate to the initial diagnostic test strategy.4–6,9,10
Furthermore, variation in patterns of preventive care after
testing in patients with different demographic or clinical
characteristics or physicians of different specialties has not
been well examined.
Previous studies of the relationship between diagnostic
testing for CAD and changes in medical management have
reached conflicting conclusions, and no studies, to the best of
our knowledge, have reported outcomes related to lifestyle
modification, including smoking, dietary choices, and exer-
cise.5,6,9,10 There is also little evidence from randomized
trials, with the notable exception of a recent analysis on
preventive medications—but not preventive lifestyle choices
—from SCOT-HEART (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the
HEART).3 In the current study, we evaluated medical man-
agement and lifestyle modification after anatomical (com-
puted tomographic angiography [CTA]) or functional testing
for CAD. We hypothesized that test choice and initial test
results would independently influence the use of preventive
medications and lifestyle practices at 60-day follow-up.
Methods
Study Design
The methods used in the PROMISE trial (PROspective
Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of chest pain) have
been described previously.11,12 The study protocol was
approved by the local or central institutional review board at
each coordinating center and at each enrolling site in North
America. The study sites (193 total) included those with
expertise in the fields of cardiology, primary care, radiology,
and anesthesia and represented the community and acade-
mia. Sponsorship of the trial was provided by the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The authors oversaw study
coordination and data management.
We enrolled symptomatic outpatients without diagnosed
CAD whose physicians believed that nonurgent, noninvasive
cardiovascular testing was necessary for the evaluation of
suspected CAD. After providing written informed consent,
10 003 eligible patients were randomly assigned to either
anatomical testing with CTA or functional testing with
exercise
electrocardiography,
nuclear
stress,
or
stress
echocardiography. The randomization was stratified by study
site and according to the choice of the intended functional
test if the patient was assigned to that study group, as
indicated before randomization.12 That is, the preferred
functional test modality was chosen prior to randomization
even though the subject might not be randomized to a
functional test. Tests were performed and interpreted by local
physicians who made all subsequent clinical decisions.
Patients were enrolled between July 27, 2010 and September
19, 2013, and followed for a minimum of 1 year.
Preventive Medications and Lifestyle Practices
Follow-up of participants was performed in site clinical visits
or through a telephone call at 60 (�14) days to assess
cardiovascular outcomes, collect test results and images,
record complications, and collect information about preven-
tive medication use and lifestyle practices.13,14 Specifically,
we collected medication information about aspirin, statin, b-
blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or
angiotensin receptor blocker use (ACEi/ARB), among other
medications; lifestyle information included adherence to a
heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking, and overweight/
obese status, as determined by a body mass index equal to or
exceeding 25, with obesity defined as defined as a body mass
index >30. To assess healthy diet, we asked, “Are you
following a specific diet to promote heart health?” (yes or no).
To assess activity level, we asked, “During the past month, did
you participate in any physical activities or exercise regularly
(1 or more times per week)? Examples include: running,
aerobics, golf, gardening, walking, etc” (yes or no). To assess
smoking, we asked, “Have you smoked in the past 2 weeks?”
(yes or no). All measures were assessed at baseline and at the
60-day visit, with the exception of healthy diet, which was
measured only at 60 days.
Initial Test Results
Initial

results
were
considered
positive,
negative,

that has been previously described and is available else-
where.11 Briefly, CTA was positive if there was a ≥70%
stenosis in the left anterior descending, or left circumflex, or
right coronary artery, or a ≥50% stenosis in the left main
coronary artery. Stress nuclear imaging was positive if there
was a reversible perfusion defect (inducible ischemia) or
mixed defect (infarct and ischemia) during stress in at least
1 territory, negative if perfusion was normal or only had
fixed
defects,
and
indeterminate
if
test
results
were
uninterpretable. Stress echocardiography was positive if
there was a reversible wall motion abnormality or mixed
abnormality during stress in at least 1 territory (ischemia),
negative if wall motion was normal or only had fixed defects
without evidence of ischemia, and indeterminate if test
results were uninterpretable. Exercise electrocardiography
was positive if there were significant ST-segment changes
consistent with ischemia.

 Clinical Outcomes
The primary clinical outcome was a composite of major
cardiovascular events that included death from any cause,
myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, and
major complication of cardiovascular procedures or diagnos-
tic testing (ie, stroke, major bleeding, renal failure, or
anaphylaxis) that occurred within 72 hours, over the period
from the 60-day visit to the last follow-up time point. We
separately examined major cardiovascular event rates among
patients who were not taking aspirin at baseline, not taking
statins at baseline, not taking a b-blocker at baseline, and not
taking an ACEi/ARB at baseline, since these were the only
patients who could newly initiate a medication.
Statistical Analysis
Primary analyses were based on patient status at baseline and
preventive medical therapy and lifestyle practices at the 60-
day follow-up. P values <0.05 were considered significant.
Comparisons of group characteristics between the testing
strategies at baseline were evaluated using a t test for
continuous variables or v2 test for categorical variables. The
v2 test was used to examine comparative changes from
baseline to 60 days between anatomical and functional
testing strategies, based on the proportions of patients who
had no change or had newly initiated or newly discontinued a
medication or lifestyle practice. McNemar’s test was used to
compare within-group changes from baseline to follow-up in
medication use and lifestyle practices.15,16 The v2 test was
also used to examine comparative changes from baseline to
60 days between anatomical and functional testing strategies
in the proportion of patients who (1) initiated a preventive
medication or lifestyle practice by the 60-day visit, but were
not initially using the medication or engaging in the lifestyle
practice at baseline; (2) discontinued a preventive medication
or lifestyle practice by the 60-day visit, but were initially using
the medication or engaging in the lifestyle practice at
baseline; (3) continued a preventive medication or lifestyle
practice by the 60-day visit, and were initially using the
medication or engaging in the lifestyle practice at baseline;
and (4) never used a preventive medication or lifestyle
practice by the 60-day visit, and were initially not using the
medication or engaging in the lifestyle practice at baseline.
We estimated 95% CIs for these proportions.
We constructed multivariable logistic regression models to
assess the association of testing strategy with overall
preventive medication and reported lifestyle practices at the
60-day visit, while controlling for patients’ demographic and
clinical characteristics and physician specialty. A full listing of
the adjustment variables included in the regression models is
available in Tables S1 and S2. These models included the
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease score.17 We did not
adjust for multiple testing.18 In additional analyses, including
analyses of differences in preventive care, we adjusted for the

ization before the 60-day visit. Results for each variable are
presented as an odds ratio with 95% CIs.
Secondary analyses using Cox models examined the
association between initiation of a preventive medication by
the 60-day visit and adverse cardiovascular events during
follow-up. Separate models examined patients who were not
taking an aspirin, statin, b-blocker, or ACEi/ARB at baseline.
Patients who experienced an adverse cardiovascular event
prior to their 60-day visit, patients who were not tested as
randomized, and patients with uninterpretable noninvasive
test results were excluded from these analyses. These models
also adjusted for noninvasive test type, noninvasive test
results, revascularization prior to or on the 60-day visit, time
from randomization to 60-day visit, baseline use of other
medications, and baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease risk score. Statistical analyses were performed using
SAS software, version 9.2 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Role of the Funding Source
The PROMISE trial was funded by National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute grants R01 HL098237, R01 HL098236, R01
HL098305, and R01 HL098235. The funding source had no
role in the design and conduct of the study; collection,
management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; prepa-
ration, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to
submit the manuscript for publication. The views expressed in

Results
Baseline Characteristics and Primary Outcome
Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, medication
use, and lifestyle habits were similar in the 4996 patients
assigned to the CTA strategy and the 5007 patients assigned
to functional testing, with the exception of the lifetime
prevalence of depression (Table S3).11 The mean age of
patients was 60.8�8.3 years, 52.7% were women, 21.4% of
the patients had diabetes, 65.0% had hypertension, 51.1%
were past or current tobacco users, 67.7% had dyslipidemia,
and 32.1% had a family history of premature CAD. A CAD risk
equivalent (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or cere-
brovascular disease) was present in 25.3% of patients. In the
CTA strategy group, 4686 (93.8%) had CTA as assigned, and in
the functional testing group, 4692 (93.7%) had a stress test as

 assigned. As previously reported,11 at a median follow-up
period of 25 months, we found no significant difference in the
composite primary end point of death, myocardial infarction,
hospitalization for unstable angina, or major procedural
complication (3.3% in the CTA group, 3.0% in the functional
testing group; hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83–1.29; P=0.75).
In the CTA group, the distribution of positive, negative,
indeterminate, and incomplete initial test results was 11.1%,
82.0%, 3.8%, and 0.1%, respectively. In the functional testing
group, the distribution of positive, negative, indeterminate,
and incomplete initial test results was 11.6%, 82.6%, 0.8%,
and 0.0%, respectively.
Changes in Medical Therapy and Reported
Lifestyle Practices From Baseline to 60-Day Visit
The median time from randomization to the 60-day visit
was 64 days (interquartile range, 58–71). Overall changes
in medication and lifestyle practices from baseline to the
60-day visit are shown in Figure 1. Within the CTA and
functional-testing arms, there were significant improvements
in preventive medications and reported lifestyle practices
from baseline to follow-up (P<0.05 for ACEi/ARB use within
both arms; P=0.002 for overweight/obese status within the
functional arm; P<0.0001 for all other measures). Between
the CTA and functional testing arms, the CTA strategy was
associated with a higher proportion of patients newly
initiating aspirin (11.8% versus 7.8%), statins (12.7% versus
6.2%), and b-blockers (8.1% versus 5.3%), compared to
functional testing (P<0.0001 for each) (Table 1). These
proportions were also compared after separately consider-
ing patients who did or did not use a medication or adhere
to a lifestyle practice at baseline (Tables 2 and 3). No
significant differences between CTA and functional testing
strategies were observed for initiation of exercise (24.9%
versus 24.4%), quitting smoking (3.6% versus 3.2%), or
weight loss in overweight/obese patients (2.8% versus
2.3%).

 We also estimated the proportion of patients who (1)
initiated a preventive medication or lifestyle practice by the
60-day visit, but were not initially using the medication or
engaging in the lifestyle practice at baseline; (2) discontinued
a preventive medication or lifestyle practice by the 60-day
visit, but were initially using the medication or engaging in the
lifestyle practice at baseline; (3) continued a preventive
medication or lifestyle practice by the 60-day visit, and were
initially using the medication or engaging in the lifestyle
practice at baseline; and (4) never used a preventive
medication or lifestyle practice by the 60-day visit, and were
initially not using the medication or engaging in the lifestyle
practice at baseline. The results are shown in Table 2 and 3.
Overall Use of Medication and Reported Lifestyle
Practices at 60-Day Visit
Compared to functional testing, an anatomical testing strat-
egy was associated with greater use of aspirin, statins, and b-
blockers at the 60-day visit (P<0.001 for all) (Figure 2).
Anatomical testing was also associated with a higher overall
prevalence of eating a healthy diet (P=0.002), and obese/
overweight status was less prevalent (P=0.040). Regular
exercise and smoking cessation increased similarly in both
arms. Overall, 600 of 4996 patients (12.0%) in the CTA group
and 403 of 5007 (8.1%) in the functional-testing group
underwent cardiac catheterization by their 60-day visit, of
whom 304 CTA patients (50.7%) and 154 functional-testing
patients (38.2%) underwent revascularization, respectively.
Effects of Test Results and Revascularization on
Medications and Reported Lifestyle Practices
Positive initial test results and early revascularization were
associated with higher aspirin, statin, and b-blocker use at
60 days, compared with negative initial test results or no
early revascularization (Table 4). Positive initial test results
were also associated with a higher prevalence of eating a

 healthy diet, while early revascularization was associated with
a higher prevalence of eating a healthy diet, exercising, and
smoking cessation (Table 5). The effect sizes for these
changes related to positive test results and early revascular-
ization were generally larger than the effect size of anatomical
versus functional testing. After adjusting for initial test
strategy, initial test results, and early revascularization,
benefits of CTA for aspirin use (P<0.001), statin use
(P<0.001), healthy diet (P=0.012), and weight loss persisted
(P=0.046) (Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2). There was no
interaction between test results and testing strategy for any
changes in preventive therapies or lifestyle practices.
While PROMISE’s pragmatic design limits our ability to fully
assess the appropriateness of preventive medication use, we
found that aspirin and statin use at the 60-day visit were more
prevalent among patients with positive initial test results
(P<0.001) and early revascularization (P<0.001), independent
of initial baseline medication use and the initial testing strategy
(Table S1). Similarly, statin use was also more prevalent among
patients with a history of dyslipidemia (P<0.001) and those with
an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease >7.5% (P=0.006),
while ACEi/ARB use was more prevalent among patients with
hypertension (P<0.001) and diabetes (P<0.001).
Effects of Medication Initiation on Adverse
Cardiovascular Events
Among patients not initially taking a preventive medication,
newly initiating an aspirin, statin, b-blocker, or ACEi/ARB was
not associated with the rate of adverse cardiovascular events
over a median follow-up period of 25 months in adjusted
models (Table S4). Because the point estimate of the hazard
ratio for medication initiation exceeded unity for each of the
medication regression models (except statins), it is possible
that we were unable to fully adjust for baseline risk at
60 days.

 cardiovascular events may have been more likely to newly
initiate preventive cardiovascular medications, and our mod-
els may be unable to fully account for this confounding.
Discussion
In this large randomized trial of diagnostic testing strategies
for the evaluation of suspected CAD, we found that patients’
use of preventive medications and adoption of preventive
lifestyle practices uniformly improved after testing, particu-
larly in patients evaluated with anatomical testing or with
positive initial test results or early revascularization. We did
not find an association between initiation of a preventive
medication and risk of adverse cardiovascular events within a
median follow-up of 25 months. Our findings highlight
important similarities between anatomical and functional
testing—both strategies identify substantial opportunities to
improve preventive medical care and lifestyle practices among
all patients, irrespective of the diagnostic strategy used.
As reflected in the PROMISE trial population, patients
newly evaluated for suspected heart disease have a high
prevalence of risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events,2
including older age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and
smoking, among other factors.14 While the overall prevalence
of test abnormalities has been low in recent years,19 and was
low in PROMISE, our study shows that changes in medical
management—particularly
aspirin
and
statin
use—and
changes in reported lifestyle practices may still occur,
independent of test results. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to also show effects on healthy eating
and weight loss among patients who are overweight or obese,
although these effects were modest. Testing therefore may
independently represent an opportunity to effectively improve
the health of patients. An area for future research is the
extent to which diagnostic testing could be augmented to
increase appropriate adoption of preventive medications and
lifestyle practices.
Our findings about the adoption of preventive medications
after testing are similar to findings recently reported in the
SCOT-HEART trial.3 These authors attributed changes in
preventive medications to changes in patients’ diagnoses after
testing, but our adjusted analyses suggest that effects on
prevention persist independent of test results and early
revascularization. In their population, CTA was associated with
a comparative increase in initiation of antiplatelet agents,
statins, and ACEi/ARB, whereas we did not detect a difference
in ACEi/ARB use; lifestyle changes were not reported. These
authors also reported a comparative improvement in health
outcomes after 50 days. There are several possible explana-
tions for differences in our findings, including differing designs
of our diagnostic testing strategies and methodological differ-
ences in our analyses.

 The reasons that CTA was associated with more preventive
changes in medications and reported lifestyle, even after
accounting for initial test results and early revascularization,
are unclear. However, it is notable that the effect size for
positive initial test results and early revascularization gener-
ally exceeded the effect size for CTA. Compared to functional
testing, CTA provides physicians with different information,
and physicians may interpret this information differently or
respond differently to abnormalities seen on CTA. Patients’
interpretation of and response to test results may also differ.
CTA
also
provides
information
about
nonobstructive
atherosclerosis and coronary artery calcification, which may
influence physician behavior. Other studies have also reported
similar findings.10 We did not specifically account for
nonobstructive atherosclerosis for several reasons: PROMISE,
as a pragmatic trial, was not designed to examine detailed
predictors of preventive care changes beyond the overall
categories of positive/negative test results; inclusion of
nonobstructive atherosclerosis in our analyses was not
prespecified; and specific predictors of preventive care
changes would more appropriately be explored within each
testing strategy separately rather than in a comparative
analysis between the 2 strategies. In addition, detailed
information about how physicians communicated test results
to patients and how patients interpreted these results was not
collected, nor were ordering physicians instructed on how to
integrate test results into the care of their patients. Future
research that dissects the anatomy of both physician and
patient decision making in the setting of diagnostic testing for
CAD could yield important insights—and potentially identify
approaches to further improve preventive practices in this
high-risk patient population.
While CTA was associated with greater adoption of
preventive medications, we did not find that a CTA testing
strategy improved cardiovascular outcomes. There are sev-
eral possible explanations for this, including the short follow-
up
period,
low
overall
event
rate,
and
small
overall
differences in preventive medication adoption between the
CTA and functional testing groups. These findings, both
individually and collectively, may have contributed to the
absence of an overall difference in testing strategy effec-
tiveness. Furthermore, we did not find that greater initiation
of preventive medications reduced the risk of adverse
cardiovascular events.
Cost-effectiveness of CTA and functional testing is also a
concern, particularly given health policy concerns about
diagnostic imaging.18 Several cost-effectiveness analyses of
diagnostic testing have been performed and have generally
concluded that both tests yield good value.20–25 However,
these studies have not accounted for the potential indepen-
dent effects of testing on preventive therapy and lifestyle
changes. One study that simulated the PROMISE trial

 compared a CTA testing strategy to a functional testing
strategy—including
stress
electrocardiography,
nuclear
stress, or stress echocardiography—and found that the
cost-effectiveness of CTA ranged from $26 200 per quality-
adjusted life-year in men to $35 000 per quality-adjusted life-
year in women.21 The effects of diagnostic testing on
preventive medical care and lifestyle that we observed in
PROMISE may further improve the favorability of these cost-
effectiveness ratios.
Our study has limitations. We were unable to disaggre-
gate the effects of physician preferences versus patient
preferences on decision making about preventive medica-
tions and reported lifestyle practices. For the initiation and
continuation of medications, our results are based on self-
report and limited to recall bias. We also did not measure
adherence, so our inferences are limited to patient or
clinician reports rather than confirmed use of medications or
engagement in lifestyle modification. Related to this, adop-
tion of and adherence to preventive medications and lifestyle
practices may change in long-term follow-up, but our work
does not inform these patterns. In future work, we will
assess patterns of long-term preventive care and lifestyle,
including patterns of medication discontinuation and use of
preventive medications in patients with and without CAD.
Importantly, we did not characterize which medication
changes were appropriate or guideline-based. We also did
not account for coronary angiography referral in the absence
of revascularization. In addition, we performed multiple
comparisons and our results should be interpreted in light of
the risk of a Type I error.
In conclusion, among patients with suspected CAD,
anatomical testing, positive initial test results, and revascu-
larization are primary drivers of changes in preventive medical
and lifestyle practices, with test type making secondary
contributions. Despite these changes, substantial opportuni-
ties exist to further reduce cardiovascular risk.

[a] The model for each medication considered only patients who were tested as randomized, had interpretable test results, and  
who had no baseline use of the medication of interest. 
[b] Unadjusted models controlled for time to day 60 visit from randomization. 
[c] Adjusted models controlled for time to day 60 visit from randomization, non-invasive test type, non-invasive test results, revascularization 
prior to or on day of 60 day visit, baseline ASCVD risk prediction, and baseline use of other medications (aspirin, statin, beta-
blocker, and ACEi or ARB).
