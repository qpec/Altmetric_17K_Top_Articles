Dense microcircuit reconstruction techniques have begun to provide ultrafine insight into the
architecture of small-scale networks. However, identifying the totality of cells belonging to
such neuronal modules, the “inputs” and “outputs,” remains a major challenge. Here, we
present the development of nanoengineered electroporation microelectrodes (NEMs) for
comprehensive manipulation of a substantial volume of neuronal tissue. Combining finite
element modeling and focused ion beam milling, NEMs permit substantially higher stimu-
lation intensities compared to conventional glass capillaries, allowing for larger volumes
configurable to the geometry of the target circuit. We apply NEMs to achieve near-complete
labeling of the neuronal network associated with a genetically identified olfactory glomerulus.
This allows us to detect sparse higher-order features of the wiring architecture that are
inaccessible to statistical labeling approaches. Thus, NEM labeling provides crucial com-
plementary information to dense circuit reconstruction techniques. Relying solely on tar-
geting an electrode to the region of interest and passive biophysical properties largely
common across cell types, this can easily be employed anywhere in the CNS.

 T
he interplay of convergent and divergent networks has
emerged as one of the organizational principles of infor-
mation processing in the brain1. Dense circuit recon-
struction techniques have begun to provide an unprecedented
amount of anatomical detail regarding local circuit architecture
and synaptic anatomy for spatially limited neuronal modules2–4.
These techniques, however, still rely predominantly on pre-
selection of target structures, because the volumes that can be
analyzed are generally small when compared to brain structures
of interest (see, however, recent advances in whole-brain stain-
ing5), or remain confined to simpler model organisms6,7. Viral
tracing approaches, on the other hand, depend on virus diffusion
and tropism, thus infection probability is highly variable among
different cell populations, preventing robust selection of a defined
target volume8,9. Therefore, functionally dissecting a specific
neural microcircuit, which typically extends >100 µm, and iden-
tifying its corresponding projections remains a challenge. The
simultaneous requirement for completeness (i.e., every neuron in
a target volume) and specificity (i.e., labeling restricted to neurons
in a target volume), in particular, is challenging using current
techniques.
Targeted electroporation as a versatile tool for the manipula-
tion of cells was initially introduced as a single-cell approach10,
which was later proposed for delineating small neuronal ensem-
bles using slightly increased stimulation currents11. It still
remains the state-of-the-art technique for specific, spatially
restricted circuit labeling and loading12,13. The exact spatial range
and effectiveness of electroporation, however, remains poorly
understood and is generally thought to be restricted to few
micrometers14. In the brain, dedicated microcircuits are often
engaged in specific computational tasks such as processing of
sensory stimuli. These “modules” or “domains” are often arranged
in stereotyped geometries, as is the case for columns in the barrel
cortex15 and spheroidal glomeruli in the olfactory bulb16.
Here, we report the development of nanoengineered electro-
poration microelectrodes (NEMs), which grant a reliable and
exhaustive volumetric manipulation of neuronal circuits to an
extent >100 µm. We achieve such large volumes in a non-
destructive manner by “gating” fractions of the total electro-
poration current through multiple openings around the tip end,
identified by modeling based on the finite element method
(FEM). Thus, a homogenous distribution of potential over the
surface of the tip is created, ultimately leading to a larger effective
electroporation volume with minimal damage. We apply this
technique to a defined exemplary microcircuit, the olfactory bulb
glomerulus, thereby allowing us to identify sparse, long-range and
higher-order anatomical features that have heretofore been
inaccessible to statistical labeling approaches.
Results
Evaluating efficacy of standard electroporation electrodes. To
provide a quantitative framework for neuronal network manip-
ulation by electroporation, the volumetric range of effective
electroporation was first calculated by FEM modeling; under
standard conditions for a 1 µA electroporation current10,14, the
presumed electroporation threshold of 200 mV transmembrane
potential17 is already reached at approximately 0.3 µm distance
from the tip, by far too low for an extended circuit (Fig. 1a, b). To
achieve electroporation sufficient for such a volume, the stimu-
lation current would have to be increased by a factor of 100,
leading to an effective electroporation radius of more than 20 µm
(Fig. 1c, d). At the same time, however, this would also sub-
stantially increase the volume experiencing >700 mV, which
is thought to be the threshold for irreversible damage and
lysis for many cellular structures18. Correspondingly, translating
these numbers to in vitro validation experiments shows the
destructive nature of standard electroporation; increased stimu-
lation intensity frequently results in “jet-like” convection move-
ment and gas bubble formation. Both occur beyond a current
threshold that scales with tip radius, and are notably within the
range of currents needed to label even small neuronal circuits
(Fig. 1e, f). Nevertheless, our modeling results were in excellent
agreement with experimental measurements of the induced
electric potential for a standard patch clamp setup (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1).
Design of nanoengineered electroporation microelectrodes. To
avoid these destructive forces during volume electroporation, the
current density should be reduced while maintaining the overall
electroporation volume. We again employed FEM modeling to
determine a suitable distribution of current across the pipette
surface. Using the axial resistance of the internal electrolyte as a
current divider, this could in principle be achieved by inserting
small, ~1–2 µm holes at varying distances from the tip and
channeling fractions of the current through multiple release sites
(Fig. 2a). Insertion of holes at only five distances results in a 50%
decrease in maximum current density at a comparable overall
electroporation volume to a standard pipette (Fig. 2b–d), whereas
fewer and larger holes lead to substantial volume loss under the
same conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Concomitantly, FEM
shows that by using such an electrode design for electroporation,
peak potentials are reduced by 80% and the volume at risk of
irreversible damage (i.e., experiencing >700 mV transmembrane
potential) is reduced tenfold for essentially the same overall
electroporation volume (Fig. 2c, d). Indeed, for the same volume
at risk of irreversible damage, volumes of more than 12-fold
larger can be effectively labeled.
To construct such “nanoengineered electroporation microelec-
trodes” (NEM), we used focused ion beam (FIB)-assisted milling.
Standard patch pipettes were pulled on a horizontal micropipette
puller, sputter coated with gold and silver painted, in order to
prevent charging in the scanning microscope. Following FIB, four
rows of five holes were created, each set apart by 90° around the
tip (Fig. 2e–g; for details, see “Methods” section).
Effectiveness of NEM electroporation in vivo. To assess the
completeness and specificity of NEM electroporation, we labeled
a typical medium-sized neuronal module in mice, the olfactory
glomerulus (Fig. 3a–e). Two dyes were electroporated sequen-
tially. First, a pipette loaded with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)
dextran (red) was used, followed by a second, independent elec-
troporation employing a fresh pipette filled with fluorescein-
dextran (green). Notably, 81.6 ± 1.2% (n = 3 mice) of green cells
were also red, with almost complete overlap for large projection
neurons in deeper layers and a similar recovery rate in superficial
layers (Fig. 3f, g). Similarly, using a transgenic mouse line bearing
a subset of projection neurons that express a GFP-derived
ratiometric indicator protein (Thy1-CLM19), NEM electropora-
tion labeled 87.5 ± 12.5% (n = 2 mice) of CLM-expressing pro-
jection neurons that are associated with a targeted glomerulus
(Supplementary Fig. 3). This indicates that NEM electroporation
indeed labels the glomerular module very effectively.
In-depth circuit architecture of the MOR174–9 glomerulus. To
assess the quantitative capability of this circuit delineation strat-
egy, we used NEM electroporation within a specific, genetically
labeled glomerulus (MOR174–9-GFP glomerulus20,21) as example
of an extended neuronal circuit (Fig. 4a, n = 5).
In total, 162 (median; q1 −26.75; q3 +25.75) cells were labeled
per glomerulus (Fig. 4b). Approximately 80% of all somata were

 located within 100 µm of the glomerular center. However, the
radius to the glomerular center was doubled (from ~180 µm to
~390 µm) in order to include the final 10% of cells, with the most
distant soma being located 471.5 µm from the glomerular center
(Fig. 4c, d). Since the functional roles of cells or cell types are
related to their spatial positions in the gross anatomical
organization of the bulb, in a second step all cells were separated
into four groups according to their respective layer identities
(Fig. 4e–g): the glomerular layer (“GL,” n = 124.2 ± 39.4 per
glomerulus; 79% of all cells), outer external plexiform layer
(“outer EPL,” n = 21.6 ± 9.5, 14%), inner external plexiform layer
(“inner EPL,” n = 3.2 ± 0.8, 2%) and mitral cell layer (“MCL,”
n = 9 ± 1.6, 6%).
In the architecture of the bulb, the MCL is of particular interest
because it is thought to represent the main output element of the
bulb, comprising mitral cells (MCs) and deep tufted cells (dTCs).
This crucial structure was found to comprise only 6% of all cells
constituting the glomerular circuitry. Since NEM labeling is near
complete, we can now ask whether the distribution of MCs and
dTCs is stereotypical between animals. MCL projection neuron
(MCLPN) soma positions were transformed and analyzed onto a
common coordinate system (see “Methods” section). Indeed,

 MCLPNs from all experiments (n = 5) were clustered within 111
µm (±68.6 µm) around a common center of gravity. The center
position of the cluster was well preserved between animals and
was shifted 92 ± 99.5 µm dorsally and 74 ± 81.8 µm posteriorly
from the projected position of the glomerulus (Fig. 5a, b).

has
determined
that
MCs

exhibit distinct electrophysiological properties in vivo and may
thus have different functional roles22–24. To distinguish between
these two cell types, we fitted a two-component Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) to analyzed our morphological data (Fig. 5c-e).
In general, there was clear separation between the two cell
types (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Surprisingly, however, some
cells were found in the MC cluster which had substantially
smaller soma areas (<200 µm2) compared to “typical” MCs.
These small MCs (sMCs) showed several other morphological
differences from typical MCs (Table 1), and likely represented
a separate group of rare MCLPNs (see also Supplementary
Fig. 4c), and are not further considered here. Therefore, in total,
5.2 (±1.1) MCLPNs could clearly be classified as classical MCs
and 3.2 (±1.3) as dTCs per MOR174–9 glomerulus (Fig. 5f).
While individual MC and dTC midpoint positions had a close
spatial relationship to each other (Supplementary Fig. 5), the
distribution patterns of MCs and dTCs showed a notable
difference between the two subsets, with a substantially larger

 spread of MCs along the dorsoventral axis than dTCs (107.4 µm
vs. 66.2 µm, Fig. 5g–i).
We further used the data set of glomerulus-affiliated neurons
to provide a comprehensive outline of the tufted cell (TC)
domain. We define a TC as every neuron that is not an MC that
has a primary apical dendrite targeting the glomerulus and also
has lateral dendrites. This definition does not comprise the
subpopulation of external tufted cells that typically do not possess
lateral dendrites. First, a depth profile of the presumed TCs was
determined with regard to relative soma position along the deep-
to-superficial axis (Fig. 6a). Within the EPL, a sharp increase in
the number of TCs was noted from the inner three quarters to the
superficial quarter. Therefore, TCs from these regions were
separated from each other and were named “middle TCs” (mTCs)
and “superficial TCs” (sTCs), respectively. On average, only 3.2
(±0.8) mTCs per glomerulus were found. On the other hand, 18.8
(±4.4) sTCs per glomerulus were found, thereby constituting 90%
of glomerulus-associated cells from the superficial quarter of the
EPL that meet our criteria for TCs. Neurons from both subsets
shared distinct common morphologic features (Table 1).
To investigate the exact spatial relationship of these domains
along the deep-to-superficial axis, dendrite distributions were
compared among the four cell types (Fig. 6b–f and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 6). In all cases considered, a highly significant separation
was found (p < 0.001 using a one-sample t test). On average, MC
and dTC dendrites were separated by 34.27 (±33.96) µm, dTC
and mTC by 25.78 (±42.21) µm, and mTC and sTC by 44.83
(±39.18) µm. The corresponding spatial “overlap,” i.e., difference
between two subsets in the non-dominant direction, was 16%
between MCs and dTCs, 21% between dTCs and mTCs, and 13%
between mTCs and sTCs. These results indicate that soma
position precisely predicts the average dendritic domain within
the EPL, which is reflected by the relative dendritic contributions
from the four cell types per EPL subregion (Fig. 6g).
TC axon collateral hotspots associate with MCLPN cluster.
Detailed anatomy, including the ability to stain individual axons,
allowed us to examine the local axonal projection pattern of the
projection neurons more closely. While TCs are known to give
rise to extensive local axonal collaterals in the internal plexiform
layer (IPL)25,26 MCs do not23, and their axon collaterals course
more distantly in the granule cell layer (GCL). Thus, stained
axonal processes in the local IPL were considered putative TC
collaterals (pTC). In individual experiments, an association
between projection neurons and pTC axon collaterals in the
adjacent IPL could be observed, and reconstructed axons from
more superficially located TCs were found to target the IPL
region adjacent to identified MCs and dTCs (Fig. 7a, b). To
analyze this apparent association quantitatively, we determined
pTC axonal density in projection maps of the local IPL (n = 3)
(detailed
in
“Methods”
section).
Irrespective
of
exact
cellular identity, matching MCLPNs indeed significantly coloca-
lized with pTC collaterals, compared to a shuffled control (see
“Methods” section; two-sample t test: for MCs p < 0.001 for dTCs
p < 0.005, for both subsets together p < 1 × 10−6). These results
provide evidence for a previously unexpected high association of
MCLPNs and pTC axon collaterals from the same glomerulus
(Fig.
7c–g).

using
serial
block-face scanning electron microscopy27–29 allowed us to
further follow pTC axons and identify synapses onto GCs in
the IPL (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8), whereas GCs in turn can
indeed make synapses onto somata of MCs directly above
them.

Discussion
Exhaustive yet specific delineation of neural circuits and projec-
tions remains a major challenge with current labeling techniques.
Here, we present the development of nanoengineered electro-
poration microelectrodes (NEMs) as a new tool for predictable,
volumetrically exhaustive manipulation of neuronal networks,
providing missing input and output functions to the emerging
field of dense circuit reconstruction techniques. With increasing
availability of nanoengineering devices in engineering and neu-
roscience departments30,31, fabrication of customized tools to
deliver or record electric fields to/from neural tissue at the
nanoscale
becomes
feasible.
Our
proposed
microelectrode
design requires only a few additional steps beyond a simple
pulling procedure of glass capillaries, and is thus facile to
implement. Certainly, fabrication design is not restricted to this
specific approach: redistribution and number of release sites are
essentially unlimited and tailored solutions for almost any geo-
metry can be implemented. Even complete nanofabrication with
silicon technology including nanostraws32 has become feasible –
with the main challenge remaining how to distribute the electric
current.
We have shown that typically-used stimulation intensities for
targeted electroporation reliably cover only a limited volumetric
range, and our modeling results here are in excellent agreement

 with our own (Supplementary Fig. 1) and published10,14 data. To
access higher stimulation intensities and thus larger volumes,
however, it was necessary to reduce peak potentials because these
led to mechanically harmful jet and gas bubble formation in
conventional pipettes, and greatly surpassed the assumed hazar-
dous transmembrane potential of 700 mV known to cause lysis
for a number of cell types18. The achieved cumulated volume
>700 mV corresponds to a conventional pipette at approximately
20 µA stimulation intensity, which is still larger than values that
were tested safe for physiological network function11. This may be
the reason why we found fewer labeled cells following a second
electroporation epoch in our double electroporation experiments,
indicating some residual damage especially among the population
of smaller neurons33,34. For probing physiological functions,
NEM design should therefore further aim to reduce peak
potentials by inserting even more release sites, or implementing
an array design that includes several NEMs.
The key target of our approach was, however, completeness of
cell loading, which can only be assessed indirectly in the absence
of a “ground truth”. We first used overlap of two independently
labeled subsets of cells in the same glomerulus as a reliability
measure and simplified surrogate parameter of completeness.
Among all cells labeled, we found an overlap of more than 80 %
while overlap among neurons residing in the inner layers of the
MCL or EPL was close to 100 %, underlining a near-complete
delineation of the circuit, especially of the MC and TC domains.
Additionally, the determined total number of neurons corre-
sponds well to average global estimates in the literature when
adjusting for the most recent number of glomeruli in mice which
was found to be far higher than previously assumed35–37 (see
also Supplementary Discussion). However, it must be acknowl-
edged that the volumetric range of our proposed stimulation
settings lies below the whole volume of the considered target
circuit (40–50 µm radius), in order not to compromise the
required specificity when handling the pipette at the microscale.
Very small cellular processes passing only peripherally through
the glomerulus might therefore still be missed by electroporation.
Indeed, while relatively straight, unbranched passing processes
resembling “juxtaglomerular association neurons”38,39, a cell type
which is believed to span multiple glomeruli, could be found in
neighboring glomeruli, we did not identify labeled somata at
distances >300 µm from the electroporation site within the
superficial layers (Supplementary Fig. 9a). This may hint at the
possibility that axonal structures are not as efficiently loaded as
dendrites by the proposed protocol, and that a dedicated strategy
might have to be used for such structures, potentially involving
the adjustment of the dextran molecular weight or the use of a
different marker. Nevertheless, our technique is generally capable
of providing retrograde axonal filling, because olfactory nerve
fascicles (which contain olfactory sensory nerve axons) can
indeed be electroporated successfully and their corresponding
glomerulus labeled (Supplementary Fig. 9b). The need for volu-
metrically exhaustive labeling approaches becomes particularly
evident when sparse, higher-order features of a neuronal circuit,
which have so far remained elusive to statistical or local labeling
approaches, are under investigation. Using NEM electroporation
we provide anatomical evidence for an earlier suggested cluster of
main projection neurons in the MCL40,41 whose size and location
was found to lie in a range similar to what has been proposed by
standard electroporation12,13,20,42. Interestingly, the position of
this cluster relative to the position of the glomerulus is well
preserved between animals, and the positional variability is sub-
stantially lower than what has been reported for the variability of
a glomerulus itself43,44. Within the cluster, MCs show almost
twice the spread in the dorsoventral direction compared to either
the anteroposterior direction or to dTCs in any direction. This
suggests a wider integration of bulbar olfactory information in the
MC subunit given the arrangement of olfactory receptor domains
in the bulb16. It furthermore suggests that MCs might receive
perisomatic inhibition from more broadly distributed GCs.
Among glomerulus-associated MCLPNs, we could identify a
small MC cell type in 40% of glomeruli, which was morpholo-
gically clearly distinct from “typical” MCs or dTCs. However, this
neuron type has been largely neglected in the literature, and we
only found a similar early drawing by Ramón y Cajal45. Further
work will be needed to establish its functional role in the context
of glomerular circuitry.
We found an exquisite laminar stratification of lateral dendrites
from different types of projection neurons, matching earlier
reports on the sublayers of the EPL using sparse labeling26,46,47.
However, our strictly quantitative examination showed only
minimal degrees of overlap between these types of cells, with
lateral dendrite position within the EPL representing a categorical
property rather than a mere preference. Interestingly, although
only representing a small group of cells, even mTCs appeared to
occupy a distinct subband, with spatial location predicting den-
dritic position. Therefore, the local information flow of the main
bulbar cell types in the EPL appears to be handled in a spatially
segregated, “floor-like” fashion, with very little direct den-
drodendritic information exchange between lateral dendrites of
different cell types to be expected. If such interconnections exist,
they must be accomplished by an additional “vertical” processing
unit like distinct GCs47,48 or short axon cells49.
While intrabulbar axon collaterals from TCs have been known
to underlie the interplay of the two mirror-symmetric glomeruli
for more than a decade50–52, the target and function of local TC

 axon collaterals have remained enigmatic23,25,26,53. In our
exhaustive labeling study, we found anatomical evidence for an
unexpected association of TC axons and MCs sharing the same
parent glomerulus, with TC axons projecting specifically to these
MC soma locations in the adjacent IPL. Given the reported
synapses onto proximal GC apical dendrites from horizontal,
presumed axonal branches54,55 as well as the distinct physiolo-
gical behavior of MCs and TCs in vivo22–24, this association
suggests a feedforward TC → GC → MC pathway. Consistent with
this, volume electron microscopy showed putative TC axons
synapsing onto GCs, as well as GC-MC axo-somatic synapses
(Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8) although unambiguous direct
evidence of such a triplet circuit is still missing. Furthermore, this
finding provides a complementary or even alternative explanation
for the observation of translaminar olfactory columns as revealed
by retrograde-specific viruses56,57.
Neuroanatomy is undergoing an impressive renaissance. Sparse
higher-order features of extended neuronal circuits, however,
have so far been elusive because they require volumetrically
exhaustive yet specific circuit manipulation techniques. NEM
electroporation therefore provides a powerful tool to complement
dense circuit reconstruction techniques in the future, by mapping
inputs and outputs of a circuit of interest and thus defining the
minimal geometric requirements needed for reconstruction.
Furthermore, the range of applications may be extended to other
molecules, such as loading local neurons with DNA constructs.

 Laplace operator and ϕind is the induced electric potential. In agreement with our
experimentally used physiological saline solution, a specific conductivity of 1.58 S/
m was assumed. The compound transmembrane potential Δϕtrans was assumed to
be made up by an expected natural neuronal resting potential Δϕrest of −70 mV
and the induced potential by the electroporation device Δϕind, resulting in
Δϕtrans¼Δϕrest þ Δϕind. The geometric design and generation of an unstructured
3D calculation mesh were done using Gmesh60 software, implementing its built-in
geometrical scripting language and the netgen algorithm61. Mesh density decreased
with increasing radial distance to the pipette axis, and the electric field drop was
expected to be highest in close vicinity to the pipette, thus our computational
precision is less significant at greater distances. The finite element simulation itself
was set up and conducted with ElmerSolver (CSC Finish IT Center for Science,
ElmerSolver manual, http://www.csc.fi/english/pages/elmer) using the imple-
mented BiCGStab method to solve the matrix equation, with an ILUT precondi-
tioner to achieve faster convergence (tolerance level 1 × 10−8). For post-processing
and visualization, the Visualization Toolkit62 and Paraview63 were used.
Subsequent volumetric calculations were run in Matlab (Version R2011a, The
MathWorks, Natwick, MA). A volume was calculated in which the expected
transmembrane potential surpassed an assumed threshold value of 200 mV, the
threshold assumed for efficient electroporation17. Furthermore, the volume
exceeding an upper limit of 700 mV was determined, assuming this to be the
threshold of cell lysis18.
Physical model and boundary conditions. The pipette was modeled as a trun-
cated cone. In agreement with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements
of a typical electrode (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 10), the outer diameter of the
pipette at 25 µm proximal to the tip was measured to be 10.6 µm, and the tip radius
was 2 µm for the NEM and 1 µm for of the assumed “standard” electroporation
pipette11,14,64. Glass thickness was 0.5 µm. The pipette tip was centered in an 80 ×
80 × 80 µm bounding box, under the assumption that the bulk of the potential drop
occurred within these limits. The current density J on the surface of the pipette was

different cell types. Red and cyan spheres show the soma positions of MCs and dTCs, respectively. No recurrent axon collaterals from MCs and only minor
contributions from dTCs can be found. By far, most axonal branches arise from sTCs. Scale bar = 100 µm. b Example of a 3D-rendered MC (red) and two

 assumed to be 0, except at the tip and the inserted holes where it was set according
to the calculated released currents I. These were obtained by a pen and paper
calculation, modeling the holes and the tip as a current divider circuit. Inside the
holes, current density was assumed to be uniform so that the relation I = JA holds,
with A being the surface.
Fabrication of microelectrodes. For standard patch-like microelectrodes, thick-
walled borosilicate glass (O.D. 2.0 mm, I.D. 1.0 mm, Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Ger-
many) was used and pulled to a tip size of 1–2 µm in diameter on a Flaming/Brown
type P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). For fabri-
cation of NEM, standard thin-walled borosilicate glass (O.D. 2.0 mm, I.D. 1.7 mm,
Science Products GmbH, Hofheim, Germany) was used. Final tip size was 3.5 to
4.5 µm in diameter. As the ability of the internal electrolyte to serve as a current
divider critically depends on actual tip geometry (Supplementary Fig. 11), we chose
a shallow tip cone with a tip angle θ of 22°. Next, glass pipettes were placed in a
high vacuum sputtering and coating system (Bal-tec MED 020, Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany) and heat-coated twice for 40 s with a piece of gold wire (diameter 0.2
mm, Plano GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Subsequently, pipettes were painted with a
conductive silver paint (SPI, Structure Probe Inc., West Chester, PA, USA) to
prevent pipettes from overcharging during application of FIB. Coated and painted
glass microelectrodes were then placed in a combined FIB-SEM workstation (Neon
40EsB, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), equipped with a gallium ion source for FIB-
assisted milling. By using the gallium ion gun at an angle of 90° to the principal axis
of the pipette, square-shaped holes were milled into the glass wall along the shaft,
up to an axial distance of 25 µm from the tip, each set apart by 5 µm. The edge
length (s) of individual holes decreased with increasing distance to the tip (s1 = 2.12
µm, s2 = 1.65 µm, s3 = 1.25 µm, s4 = 0.82 µm and s5 = 0.6 µm). Milling current and
dwell time per area were chosen such that every shot could penetrate through both
glass walls. Next, pipettes were rotated axially by 90 degrees and the procedure was
repeated. Finally, the cone assumed a 5-level, cross-like pattern having the largest
openings close to the tip.
Electric potential measurements in vitro. For in vitro electric potential mea-
surements, a recording and a stimulation electrode, both standard patch-like glass
microelectrodes, were filled with extracellular Ringer’s solution (NaCl 135 mM,
KCl 5.4 mM, HEPES 5.0 mM, MgCl2 1 mM, CaCl2 2.0 mM, pH 7.2, 280 mOsm/kg)
and immersed in a bath containing the same Ringer’s solution at room tempera-
ture. Electrodes were placed in the same focal plane at defined distances to each
other and monitored under a standard upright microscope (Zeiss, Wetzlar,
Germany). The grounding electrode was placed near the edge of the bath. Both
stimulating and recording electrode as well as the ground were composed of
chlorided silver wire. At each distance, trains of stimulation pulses of defined
intensities (10–50 µA) were delivered under a typical electroporation regime (25 ms
pulse length delivered at 2 Hz) and recorded by a microelectrode amplifier device
(Axoclamp-2B, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Data were digitized by a
converter board (ITC-18, AutoMate Scientific Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA) and read
out by the software IgorPro (WaveMetrics Inc., Portland, Oregon, USA) on a
standard desktop computer.
To test formation of gas bubbles, only the stimulation electrode was monitored
and filmed at x40 magnification while steadily increasing current intensity per
pulse (5 µA per second), while using typical electroporation settings (25 ms pulse
length delivered at 2 Hz).
In vivo surgical procedures. All experimental procedures were performed
according to the animal welfare guidelines of the Max Planck Society and the
guidelines of German animal welfare law. For two-photon targeted electroporation
of individual glomeruli, a genetically modified mouse strain was used that expresses
GFP under the promoter of the mouse olfactory receptor (MOR) 174–920,21.
Experiments targeted the dorsal MOR174–9 glomerulus. As reported for other
glomeruli43,44 its position was variable (between 10% and 22% on the anterior-
posterior axis and 51–62% on the medial-lateral axis, n = 10 bulbs), so targeting was
based on GFP fluorescence. For confirmatory experiments of the method a
transgenic mouse line (Thy1-CLM) was also used, which is known to exhibit Thy1-
driven expression of the ratiometric indicator protein CLM in a subset of projec-
tion neurons of the olfactory bulb19. MOR174–9 or Thy1-CLM animals (P35–42)
were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of meditomidin 0.75 mg/kg, fen-
tanyl 0.025 mg/kg and midazolam 10.00 mg/kg. Body temperature was kept at 37 °
C throughout the procedure. After removing the scalp and exposing the cranial
bone, the periosteum was thoroughly removed using a scalpel. Next, a metal head
plate was attached to the skull using instant adhesive Loctite 4011 (Loctite Cor-
poration, Rocky Hill, CT, Mississauga, Ontario). After clean exposure of the area
above the anterior part of the right MOB, a sealing well was formed of Paladur
dental acrylic (Heraeus Holding GmbH, Hanau, Germany). Additionally, an AgCl
grounding electrode was attached to the well. The skull overlaying the anterior part
of the right MOB was thinned using a dental drill. To prevent breaking or clogging
of the pipette, the dura mater was removed. Thirty–sixty min after completion of
the electroporation protocol, animals were sacrificed by transcardial paraf-
ormaldehyde perfusion (4% with pH adjusted to 8.9).
In vivo imaging and electroporation. Mice were placed in a custom built two-
photon microscope65 equipped with a Ti-Sapphire laser (Coherent Inc., Santa
Clara, CA, USA) and the sealed well filled with extracellular Ringer’s solution
(NaCl 135.0 mM, KCl 5.4 mM, HEPES 5.0 mM, MgCl2 1.0 mM, CaCl2 2.0 mM, pH
7.2, 280 mOsm/kg). To focus on the MOR174–9-GFP glomerulus, a ×16 water
immersion objective (0.8 NA, Nikon) was used. For two-photon excitation, the
laser was tuned to 880 nm. NEMs were tip-filled with extracellular Ringer’s solu-
tion (NaCl 135 mM, KCl 5.4 mM, HEPES 5.0 mM, MgCl2 1 mM, CaCl2 2.0 mM,
pH 7.2) containing either tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) (8.3 mg/ml) or fluorescein
(12.5 mg/ml) 3000 MW dextran-conjugated dyes (Invitrogen, Life Technologies
GmbH). Complementary backfilling was performed with plain Ringer’s, as
described above. Pipettes were mounted on a micromanipulator (Luigs & Neu-
mann, Ratingen, Germany) and the grounding electrode of the well connected to
the ground of a stimulus isolation unit (ISO-STIM 01D, npi electronic GmbH,
Tamm, Germany).
Electroporation settings were 25 ms, 50 µA strong square pulses delivered at a
frequency of 2 Hz over 5 min. During tissue insertion, slight constant positive
pressure (10–20 mbar) was applied to the pipette to allow constant dye perfusion of
the tissue. Upon completion of the program, the pipette was retracted and the
animal sacrificed after 30–60 min. In case of “double-dye” experiments, two
independent electroporation experiments with fresh pipettes and solutions were
performed, with approximately 15 min between experiments.
Immediately after electroporation, the initial electroporation success could
already be visualized and followed directly under the two-photon microscope
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Histological processing and data acquisition. After transcardial perfusion with
20 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 20 ml 4% paraformaldehyde,
fixed brains were removed. For post-fixation, brains were kept in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde solution for 12 h at room temperature. After extensive rinsing, tissues
were embedded in a 10% gelatin block. The block was then kept in a 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde solution at 4 °C overnight. Brains were cut into 50–80 µm thick, free-
floating horizontal sections on a vibratome (HM 650 V, MICROM International
GmbH, Walldorf, Germany).
Slices were washed in PBS and incubated in DAPI-containing PBS solution
(1:500) for 2 h at room temperature. After re-rinsing sections in PBS, they were
mounted on a glass slide in VectaShield solution (Vector Laboratories Inc.,
Burlingame, CA, USA), coverslipped and stored at 4 °C.
Histological sections were imaged on a confocal laser microscopy system (TCS
SP5, Leica Microsystems CMS, Mannheim, Germany) using a x20 glycerin
immersion objective (NA 0.7). Image stacks were acquired employing an
acquisition matrix of 1024 × 1024 and a z-depth of 0.6 µm. To minimize crosstalk
and bleedthrough between fluorescent channels, each image frame was excited
separately by each laser (405 nm for DAPI, 488 nm for fluorescein-dextran and
543 nm for TMR-dextran) and detected by only one narrow bandwidth
photomultiplier in parallel. No simultaneous imaging was performed. Unless
otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA).
Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. Fresh mouse brain slices were
fixed by immersion and prepared for serial block-face scanning electron micro-
scopy (SBEM) as described previously66. Two data sets were acquired on a Zeiss
Merlin SEM (with Gemini II column) equipped with an automated ultramicrotome
(Gatan 3View2XP) imaging with a 2 keV electron beam at a dose of 20 e−/nm2 and
dwell times of 3 µs in high vacuum, obtaining voxel sizes of 13 * 13 * 32 nm3 in x,y,z
respectively across a (180 × 180) µm2 field of view and throughout 40 and 200 µm
in z, respectively. Data were acquired using the 3View system with DigitalMicro-
graph. Images were registered and normalized using Fiji67 and later formatted for
analysis in WebKnossos68.
Data analysis and quantification. Acquired image data were further analyzed
using Amira (Visage Imaging GmbH, Berlin, Germany), and all further quantifi-
cation procedures included in the Results were performed employing custom
routines in Matlab (Version R2011a, The MathWorks, Natwick, MA).
General image alignment. Initially, all image stacks from each experiment were
manually aligned in a virtual 3D space, so that the 3D center of the MOR174–9
glomerulus was located at the origin and the Y-axis cut the MCL at 90° in this
central plane. The first and last image planes of the histological sections from each
brain were adjusted according to continuous cellular processes in the X and Y
directions and in the Z direction, by shifting the planes to the same level. After
complete alignment of individual experiments, the entire data set was resampled
and merged.
Identification of cell soma positions. To obtain the exact 3D positions of labeled
cell somata, markers were manually placed in the center of neurons as verified by
typical cell size, shape and presence of a nucleus, which was always confirmed by
positive DAPI staining.

 In double-dye experiments, only one dye was analyzed per cell identification
session. Therefore, the operator was always blind to the second dye. This was
necessary to ensure independent identification of cell somata. Only overlays with
the DAPI channel were allowed.
Double-dye experiments: To quantify mutual overlap in double-dye
experiments, a Euclidean distance matrix was calculated for each experiment
between the identified 3D soma positions of the two dyes. If the distance between
two points was <4 µm, which is less than the radius of even a small periglomerular
cell, the two markers were counted as a matching double stain. This seems a good
approximation, because at least two radii are expected to separate two different
cells. If a marker did not show a matching partner with a Euclidean distance of <4
µm, this cell was counted as singly stained in the TMR or fluorescein channel,
respectively. After acquisition of these numbers, basic statistics were calculated
including mean and SD.
Total cell count analysis: Cell markers were counted and basic statistics
calculated. Euclidean distances (Matlab command “pdist2”) from somata to the
center of the glomerulus were determined per experiment, and plotted as a
histogram including SDs, to investigate the distribution of cells. Based on these
data, percentage-wise radial distance borders were derived. Subsequently, each cell
was attributed to its layer identity and the distance distribution was again
calculated. The “layer identity” of each cell is the subregion of the MOB in which
the soma is located. We defined four different subregions in our analysis: (1) GL,
which is the layer comprising the olfactory glomeruli and the surrounding, tightly
packed bands of cells; (2) outer EPL, which is the superficial quarter of the EPL,
where cells should be separated by at least the diameter of one cell from the GL
(approx. 10–15 µm); (3) inner EPL, which is the inner three quarters of the EPL,
where cells should be separated by at least the diameter of one cell from the MCL
(approx. 20–25 µm); and (4) MCL, which is the band of cells between the EPL and
the IPL.
Transformation operation: To investigate and compare exact spatial positions
between animals, a transformation operation was performed, transforming the
glomerular architecture of individual experiments to one common coordinate
system (Supplementary Fig. 13): First, a landmark mesh of 9 × 9 points was placed
at the GL-EPL-border with its center point located in the midplane of the
glomerulus on the Y-axis. The points were spaced by 30 µm in the X- and Z-
directions. Additionally, the cranial pole of the glomerulus was marked. By using
principal component analysis (Matlab command “princomp”), a plane was fitted to
the landmark mesh and the normal passing through the origin was determined.
This straight line was set as the new Y-axis by rotating the coordinate system
around the X- and Z-axes. Finally, the coordinate system was rotated around the Y-
axis so that the cranial pole could be preserved.
Although the exact anatomical orientation is not maintained in the transformed
space because of slightly different transformation operations in each experiment,
the main axes can still roughly be related to the main anatomical axes as follows: X-
axis corresponds to the posterior-to-anterior direction, Y-axis to the lateral-to-
medial direction and Z-axis to the dorsal-to-ventral direction.
Cell cluster analysis of MCLPNs. Upon completion of the transformation
operation, the center-of-mass (or “common midpoint”) was determined by calcu-
lating means of the three spatial coordinates. Euclidean distances from MCLPNs to
the common midpoint were determined as well as distances in each of the three
spatial dimensions, including mean values and SDs. The same distances were then
calculated for each experiment and these individual MCL midpoints were sepa-
rately and consequently compared to the common midpoint. Since MCLPNs were
essentially localized on a plane parallel to the X–Z plane, the cellular density was
assessed on a maximum Y projection, first counting the cell somata in bins of 20 ×
20 µm along the X- and Z-axis. For smoothing, a 4 × 4 sliding frame average was
performed calculating the mean of the centered bin.
After separation of MCs and dTCs (see below), the same calculations were
performed for each of the two subsets separately. The only difference was that the
binned cell count (bin size 50 × 50 µm) was not followed by a smoothing operation
because of the low number of cells. Here, only discrete numbers were determined
and plotted.
Morphologic reconstruction of cells. Manual and semi-automated tracing of
cellular processes of MCs, dTCs, mTCs, and sTCs was achieved using the Filament
Editor of the Amira software (Visage Imaging GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Detected
nodes, vertices, segments and lines were exported to Matlab for further analysis. To
ensure that lateral dendrites were indeed correctly identified in continuity and
attributed to their respective somatic origin, we performed an independent second
back-tracing from the periphery to the soma in 15 randomly chosen dendrites from
3 of our 5 experiments (i.e., 45 dendrites in total), in which complete agreement
with the first tracing was achieved (Supplementary Fig. 14).
Separation of MCs and dTCs. First, soma size of cells was determined by fitting
an elliptical shape to the interior of a cell body. The area was measured in the plane
containing the largest soma size. Dendritic reconstructions of MCLPNs were
imported into Matlab after truncating the apical dendrite at the most distal
bifurcation node and after removal of axonal elements. Dendritic arbors consisted
of a multitude of interconnected nodes or vertices giving rise to segments. Each
segment length was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the starting node
and the end node of the segment. The midpoint of each segment was calculated
and the relative position in the EPL determined. Each segment was then weighted
by its length relative to the total dendritic length of the cell, and all the segments
added so that a mean lateral dendrite position of the cell resulted. For separation of
MCs and dTCs, a two-component GMM was fitted to the data of the two para-
meters “mean relative lateral dendrite position in the EPL” (1 = GL-EPL border, 0 =
MCL) and “soma size” (Matlab command “gmdistribution.fit”). These two para-
meters are thought to represent principal morphological separators between the
two subsets of MCLPNs22,26,47,69,70. The calculated posterior probabilities which
correspond to “cluster membership scores” were then retrieved and plotted for each
cell individually. An assumed lower boundary value of 200 µm2 soma size was
taken to separate “normal” MCs from “small” MCs22.
Morphometric analysis of MCs, dTCs, mTCs, and sTCs. Similarly to MCs and
dTCs, soma size of mTCs and sTCs was determined by fitting an ellipse to the
interior of the cell body in the transverse plane containing the largest section of the
soma. Mean relative lateral dendrite positions within the EPL were calculated in a
fashion analogous to MCs and dTCs. To determine relative soma positions of
mTCs and sTCs within the EPL, the transversal median cutting plane of a cell
was identified, and the distance from the MCL to the soma and the width of
the EPL were measured at the same position and the relative position calculated.
Other positional parameters were determined likewise in the four cell types,
including most superficial and most internal lateral dendrite extensions, most
distal apical dendrite bifurcation and position of the axonal origin. Additional
morphometric parameters included the number of lateral dendrites, number of
secondary dendrites along the apical dendrite and distance from the axonal origin
to the soma [µm].
Dendritic projections: Transformed dendritic reconstructions (“traces”) from
superficial TCs, middle TCs, deep TCs and MCs were imported into Matlab and
relative spatial positions of the reconstructions determined: The 3D space of an
experiment was first divided into small discrete bricks of 20 µm along the X- and Z-
axes, which maintained full length in the Y direction (i.e., along the deep-to-
superficial axis). Similar to the analysis of MCs and dTCs, midpoints of dendritic
segments were then determined and each segment was assigned to one brick
according to the spatial position of the midpoints. For all experiments, there were
116,230 segments assigned to 32,000 bricks. To be able first to calculate the
distribution of lateral dendrites within the EPL, the local minimum and maximum
dendrite extension (of any of the four cell types) within a region of 1 ± 3 bins was
determined and taken as surrogate position of the MCL (minimum) and the GL-
EPL-border (maximum). The difference between the two was regarded as the width
of the EPL and the relative dendrite position of each segment was determined.
Segments were weighted according to their length in relation to the total dendritic
reconstruction length of the respective cell type, and plotted as a histogram from
the MCL to the GL-EPL border. To next assess the relative position of the four
trace types to each other, the mean lateral dendritic position of each of the four
trace types was determined per brick, by averaging the Y positions of the segment
midpoints (if there was more than one segment of the same cellular identity in one
brick). Each segment was weighted by the segment length relative to the total
dendrite length of the same cell type in that respective brick. Then, mean Y
positions were subtracted from each other in every brick in which dendritic
reconstructions from at least two cell types could be detected. The resulting
differences between two traces were counted in bins of 10 µm from −250 µm to
+250 µm. The counts for each of the trace types were normalized so that the
integral over all counts was 1. Finally, mean values and SDs over the bin counts
were calculated, and a one-sample t test was performed under the null hypothesis
that the difference count was a random sample from a normal distribution with
mean 0 (Matlab command “ttest”). Finally, the relative contributions of the four cell
types along the (normalized) deep-to-superficial axis were calculated by first adding
the absolute length of lateral dendrites from the four cell types within subregion
bins of 0.05 and then dividing by the dendritic length of each individual cell type in
the respective bins per experiment. The “relative average dendrite contribution” was
then determined as the mean over all five experiments.
Axon collaterals: To reveal the local axonal projection pattern, first projection
masks of the IPL were created (n = 3): Each individual confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM) image stack (40–70 µm section thickness) of the respective
experiment was aligned parallel to the MCL plane, and a restricted maximum
intensity Y projection (see above, corresponding to the deep-to-superficial axis)
was calculated comprising only the IPL region. The resulting 2D projections of the
IPL were then thresholded by the respective pixel mean of the projection and
binarised. These maps were stitched together so that a binarised projection mask of
the entire local IPL resulted. In these maps, only pixels from labeled axons and
some vascular structures were expected to remain above 0. Image artifacts
introduced by blood vessels were removed manually. Corresponding positions of
MCs and dTCs, as well as the position of the projected glomerular center, were
marked on this mask. To visualize preferential axonal projections, a 7 × 7 sliding
frame average was performed and plotted as a heat map. To obtain a quantitative
description of the correlation between axonal projections and the positions of
MCLPNs, the total number of positive pixels was counted in a region of 40 × 40 µm
of the original, unsmoothed mask, centered to the position of identified MCs and

 dTCs of the same experiment. This count was then compared to a pixel count
within a region of 40 × 40 µm centered to the positions of the non-matching
MCLPNs from the other two experiments as an intrinsic control. The results for
the positions of all MCLPNs as well for MCs and dTCs alone were grouped, and
basic statistics calculated.
