SUMMARY
Classically, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) stim-
ulation promotes G protein signaling at the plasma
membrane, followed by rapid b-arrestin-mediated
desensitization andreceptor internalization intoendo-
somes. However, it has been demonstrated that
some GPCRs activate G proteins from within internal-
ized cellular compartments, resulting in sustained
signaling. We have used a variety of biochemical, bio-
physical, and cell-based methods to demonstrate the
existence, functionality, and architecture of internal-
ized receptor complexes composed of a single
GPCR, b-arrestin, and G protein. These super-com-
plexes or ‘‘megaplexes’’ more readily form at recep-
tors that interact strongly with b-arrestins via a C-ter-
minal tail containing clusters of serine/threonine
phosphorylation sites. Single-particle electron micro-
scopy analysis of negative-stained purified mega-
plexes reveals that a single receptor simultaneously
binds through its core region with G protein and
through its phosphorylated C-terminal tail with b-ar-
restin. The formation of such megaplexes provides a
potentialphysicalbasis forthenewlyappreciatedsus-
tained G protein signaling from internalized GPCRs.
INTRODUCTION
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling ensues when an
agonist binds to and stabilizes an active receptor conformation.
This agonist bound GPCR, acting through its transmembrane
core, promotes interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins
(Gabg), thus stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange and sep-
aration of the Ga subunit from the Gbg subunits (Gilman, 1987).
G protein subunits then interact with a variety of effectors, such
as enzymes and ion channels, to initiate downstream responses
(Gilman, 1987; Pierce et al., 2002).
To terminate G protein signaling, cells have devised a special-
ized desensitization mechanism that includes phosphorylation of
receptors by GPCR kinases (GRKs) and subsequent recruitment
of b-arrestins (barrs) to the phosphorylated receptor (Moore et al.,
2007). barrs engage both the phosphorylated C-tail and thetrans-
membrane core of the receptor. The latter interaction overlaps
with the G protein-binding site and thus sterically hinders further
G protein activation (Kang et al., 2015; Shukla et al., 2014; Szcze-
pek et al., 2014). Additionally, barr binding initiates receptor inter-
nalization by interaction with the endocytic machinery (i.e., cla-
thrin, adaptin-2, etc.) (Goodman et al., 1996; Laporte et al.,
1999). Depending on the strength of the GPCR-barr interaction,
the receptor may either undergo transient internalization, fol-
lowed by recycling to the plasma membrane for weak interac-
tions (class A GPCRs), or sustained internalization into endo-
somes for stronger interactions (class B GPCRs) (Oakley et al.,
1999, 2000).Furthermore, barrs themselve serve as an alternative
signaling system by acting as adaptors and scaffolds to interact
with numerous signaling molecules (Pierce et al., 2002).
Thus, our current understanding features G protein signaling
originating at the cell surface, followed by rapid barr-mediated
quenching of G protein signaling, both by competition with G
proteins for receptor interaction and by internalization of the re-
ceptors. However, recent findings have begun to challenge
these paradigms. A number of GPCRs have been reported to
engage in sustained G protein signaling, rather than being de-
sensitized after initial agonist stimulation (Calebiro et al., 2009;
Feinstein et al., 2013; Ferrandon et al., 2009; Irannejad et al.,
2013; Mullershausen et al., 2009). Interestingly, this newly appre-
ciated sustained phase of G protein activation appears to be
mediated by internalized receptors in endosomes, where they
modulate effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase (Calebiro et al.,
Cell 166, 907–919, August 11, 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc.
907
 2009; Feinstein et al., 2011, 2013; Ferrandon et al., 2009; Iranne-
jad et al., 2013; Mullershausen et al., 2009). These findings
cannot be accommodated within the traditional model of
GPCR signaling systems since prolonged residence of a GPCR
in endosomes requires a persistent ‘‘class B’’ interaction of
barr with the receptors, which should prevent G protein activa-
tion (Feinstein et al., 2011, 2013; Wehbi et al., 2013).
Recent X-ray crystallographic findings of the b2-adrenergic
receptor (b2AR) in complex with Gs have indicated that the
receptor forms a highly engaged complex with Gs that involves
interactions of both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of
the Gas subunit with intracellular loop 2, transmembrane domain
5 (TM5), and TM6 of the b2AR (Rasmussen et al., 2011). A nega-
tive-stain electron microscopy (EM) study of GPCR-barr com-
plexes using a b2V2R receptor chimera (b2AR where the C-termi-
nal tail was exchanged for the vasopressin type 2 receptor [V2R]
C-terminal) revealed that barr assumes two different conforma-
tions (Shukla et al., 2014); one in which the barr is bound only
to the phosphorylated receptor C-terminal tail and appears to
hang from the receptor (‘‘tail’’ conformation) and a second
more fully engaged conformation, in which, in addition to the
tail interaction, a flexible loop in barr, termed the fingerloop,
inserts into the transmembrane core of the receptor (‘‘core’’
conformation). An arrangement similar to this ‘‘core’’ conforma-
tion was recently described in a crystal structure of a rhodopsin-
visual arrestin complex (Kang et al., 2015).
The observation of the ‘‘tail’’ conformation of the GPCR-barr
complex,inwhichtheentirereceptorcytoplasmicsurfaceencom-
passing intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3 is exposed, raises the ques-
tion of whether it might be possible for both Gs and barr to simul-
taneously interact with the receptor and thus provide a molecular
basis for sustained G protein signaling by GPCRs from endo-
somes. Accordingly, here we set out to test this hypothesis by us-
ing a variety of cellular, biochemical, and biophysical approaches.
RESULTS
Real-Time Cyclic AMP Kinetic Studies of Class A and
Class B GPCRs
Sustained G protein signaling by internalized GPCRs has been
demonstrated for a number of receptors. Interestingly, this
feature has been more commonly observed in class B GPCRs,
including the parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor (PTHR) (Fer-
randon et al., 2009), V2R (Feinstein et al., 2013), and thyroid-stim-
ulating hormone receptor (TSHR) (Calebiro et al., 2009). These
receptors form more stable complexes with barr compared to
class A GPCRs, which only transiently interact with barr (Oakley
et al., 2000). Given that class B receptors bind barr more tightly,
and given the well-characterized role of barr in desensitizing
GPCRs, it seems paradoxical that class B receptors, rather
than class A receptors, promote sustained G protein signaling.
To directly assess the relative propensity of class A and B
GPCRs to promote sustained signaling, we monitored agonist-
stimulated Gs signaling, measured here as cyclic AMP (cAMP)
accumulation, in HEK293 cells stably expressing ICUE2, a fluo-
rescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor detecting
cytoplasmic cAMP (Violin et al., 2008). This ICUE2 biosensor
measures cAMP concentration in real-time and thus represents
an equilibrium between production and degradation of cAMP.
These cells were transiently transfected with the b2AR as a proto-
typical class A GPCR or the V2R as a prototypical class B GPCR.
In addition, we used a modified version of the b2AR, the b2V2R, in
which the b2AR C-terminal tail has been exchanged with the V2R
C-terminal tail. The b2V2R maintains the pharmacological proper-
ties of the b2AR, but has significantly higher affinity for barr than
for b2AR, and this increase in affinity manifests predominantly
as a change in the receptor internalization pattern from class A
to B (Oakley et al., 1999, 2000). In addition, we have successfully
purified stable and functional GPCR-barr complexes using the
b2V2R. Therefore, the b2V2R was used to study both the cellular
and biophysical basis for sustained G protein signaling by inter-
nalized class B GPCR-barr complexes.
Within the first 5 min of agonist challenge b2AR, b2V2R, and
V2R all stimulated cAMP production to a similar extent. Beyond
5 min, the cAMP responses were attenuated to different levels
among these receptors and most prominently for the wild-type
b2AR (Figure 1A). In addition, the agonist-stimulated cAMP
response was diminished slightly more at the b2V2R compared
to the V2R (Figure 1A). These results suggest that class B GPCRs
promote sustained G protein signaling to a greater degree than
does a prototypical class A GPCR.
To investigate whether sustained G protein signaling of class
B GPCRs arises from internalized compartments b2AR, b2V2R,
or V2R-expressing cells were agonist-stimulated for 10 min to
allow for internalization to occur. Then Gs signaling arising
from only the cell membrane was inhibited by the addition of
10 mM of a membrane-impermeable antagonist (CGP-12177
for b2AR and b2V2R, or (d(CH2)5
1,D-Tyr(Et)2,Val4,Arg8,des-
Gly9)-Vasopressin (H-3192) for V2R; Figure 1B) (Jard et al.,
1986; Staehelin et al., 1983). To inhibit Gs signaling arising
from both the cell membrane and the internalized compart-
ments, 10 mM of a cell-permeable antagonist (ICI-118551 for
b2AR and b2V2R or SR121463 for V2R; Figure 1B) was used (Mo-
rello et al., 2000; O’Donnell and Wanstall, 1980).
Under these conditions, for the b2AR, both antagonists quickly
inhibited almost all Gs signaling (Figure 1C). However, for the
b2V2R, only ICI-118551 fully blocked Gs signaling, whereas
CGP-12177 only partially inhibited it (Figure 1C). These results
indicate that a significant fraction of the b2V2R-stimulated
cAMP originates from internalized compartments. In a similar
fashion, the V2R-stimulated cAMP response was only partially
antagonized when exposed to the cell-membrane-impermeable
antagonist, H-3192, but fully antagonized following the addition
of the cell-membrane-permeable antagonist, SR121463 (Fig-
ure 1C). Therefore, V2R-mediated Gs signaling at 10 min post-
agonist-stimulation is, in part, due to internalized receptors.
These results demonstrate that both the b2V2R and V2R stimu-
late Gs signaling from internalized compartments, whereas the
b2AR does not seem to exhibit such behavior using this method.
Monitoring Heterotrimeric Gs Activation at Internalized
Compartments by Class A and Class B GPCRs Using
Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer
Biosensors
To confirm that the receptor-stimulated cAMP response from
internalized compartments results from Gs activation, and
908

 not from other signaling cascades, we directly monitored
agonist-stimulated heterotrimeric Gs activation by biolumines-
cence resonance energy transfer (BRET), which detects the
proximity between two proteins within a 10 nm range (Marullo
and Bouvier, 2007). Following Gs activation, the Gas subunit
separates from the Gbg subunits. This separation was detected
following agonist challenge of b2AR, b2V2R, or V2R-expressing
cells as a decrease in BRET between the functionally validated
BRET pair RlucII-117-Gas and GFP10-Gg1 (Figures 2A, 2B,
and S1). Such BRET-based assays have been developed as sen-
sors of G protein activation (Gale
´ s et al., 2006).
To specifically monitor Gs activation/separation at internalized
compartments, we developed an agonist washout protocol. In
short, agonists were allowed to stimulate receptors for varying
time intervals (0.5 to 14 min), followed by a washout of the ago-
nists. Next, the cells were incubated for 20 min in agonist-free
media, and responses were recorded (Figures 1B and 2C). Since
washout only removes agonist from the extracellular environ-
ment, but not from the intracellular environment, which contains
internalized receptors, the receptors insensitive to agonist
washout must be activating the Gs from within internalized
compartments (Figure 1B).
As shown in Figure 2C, the agonist washout protocol blunted
Gs activation in b2AR, b2V2R, and V2R-expressing cells. How-
ever, by increasing the duration of stimulation prior to agonist
washout, and thereby allowing more receptors to internalize, a
substantially diminished signal reduction by agonist washout
was observed (Figure 2C). This dampening in signal reduction
was most prominent, and statistically significant, for b2V2R and
V2R, which still maintained 54% and 64% of their Gs activity,
respectively, when cells were pre-stimulated for 14 min followed
by agonist washout, as compared to the unwashed control con-
ditions (Figure 2C). For the b2AR, increasing the duration of stim-
ulation prior to agonist washout did not result in a statistically

 significant difference in remaining Gs activity when compared to
0.5 min pulse stimulation (Figure 2C). In this setup, the class B
GPCRs, b2V2R and V2R, seem to activate heterotrimeric Gs
from internalized compartments, whereas the class A GPCR,
b2AR, does not to any significant degree.
Co-localization of GPCR, barr, and Gas in Endosomes by
Confocal Microscopy
Receptor
internalization
from the plasma membrane into
endosomes is driven by formation of a GPCR-barr complex.
Therefore, to investigate whether G protein may interact with
GPCR-barr complexes in endosomes, we began by tracking
the cellular localization of functionally validated N-terminal
SNAP-tagged GPCRs (SNAP-b2AR, SNAP-b2V2R, or SNAP-
V2R) pre-labeled with SNAP-Surface 649 fluorescence sub-
strate, mStrawberry-barr2, and mEmerald-67-Gas expressed
in HEK293 cells following agonist treatment using confocal
microscopy (Figure S1).
Prior to agonist stimulation, SNAP-tagged receptors (b2AR,
b2V2R, or V2R) and mEmerald-67-Gas were predominantly
located at the plasma membrane, whereas mStrawberry-
barr2 was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Figures
3A, S2, and S3A). Following agonist stimulation, mEmerald-
67-Gas rapidly translocates from the plasma membrane to

BRET decrease observed in the unwashed condition (i.e., in the continuous presence of agonist) and represents the mean ± SE of N = 4–5 experiments. One-

mEmerald-67-Gas was predominantly distributed within the
cytoplasm (Figures 3A, S2, and S3A). In contrast, following
agonist stimulation, mStrawberry-barr2 was recruited from the
cytoplasm to the activated SNAP-tagged receptors (5 min
post-stimulation) at the plasma membrane followed by GPCR-
barr complex internalization into endosomes (>20 min post-stim-
ulation) (Figures 3A, S2, and S3A). At longer agonist exposure
times (>20 min post-stimulation), increased mEmerald-67-Gas
intensity can be visualized in b2V2R-barr2 and V2R-barr2 contain-
ing endosomes (Figures 3 and S3), but this was not observed for
the b2AR, which is likely because it only forms transient com-
plexes with barr2 (Figure S2). Line-scan analysis of all three fluo-
rophores within these endosomes demonstrates co-localization
of b2V2R/V2R, barr2, and Gas, supporting the hypothesis that
‘‘megaplexes’’ of class B GPCRs, barr, and heterotrimeric Gs
form in endosomes (Figures 3B, 3C, S2B, and S3C).
Agonist-Stimulated Interaction between barrs and Gs
Subunits
To confirm close molecular proximity between different mega-
plex components following receptor stimulation, we utilized
BRET. If megaplexes form, G protein and barr will simultaneously
interact with a single active receptor, and thus, measurement of
BRET between functionally validated Gs subunits (Gas or Gg2)

and barr1/2 following agonist stimulation
can serve to detect these complexes
(Figures 4A and S1). In BRET titration ex-
periments, agonist-stimulation for 20 min
of either b2V2R or V2R increased the
BRET signal between RlucII-67-Gas and
GFP10-barr1/2 (Figures 4B and 4D). A sig-
nificant agonist-promoted BRET increase
between RlucII-Gg2 and GFP10-barr1/2
was also detected, indicating that the
agonist-promoted recruitment of barr1/2
to the b2V2R or V2R brings barr1/2 into
close proximity to both the Gas and Gbg
subunits.
In
contrast,
no
change
in
the BRET signal was detected between
GFP10-barr1/2 and either RlucII-67-Gas or RlucII-Gg2 following
ISO treatment of b2AR-transfected HEK293 cells (Figures 4B and
4D). Interestingly, in BRET kinetic experiments, which are slightly
more sensitive than titration experiments, a weak ISO-promoted
BRET signal was observed between GFP10-barr1/2 and RlucII-
67-Gas but not RlucII-Gg2 in cells expressing b2AR. (Figures
4C and 4E). In BRET kinetic experiments, for both b2V2R and
V2R, the agonist-mediated signals between barr1/2 and both
RlucII-67-Gas and RlucII-Gg2 were pronounced and rapidly
increased until plateauing �10 min after agonist treatment.
In the resting state heterotrimeric Gs is initially located at the
cell membrane and barr is dispersed within the cytoplasm,
thus, we tested whether the BRET signals detected following
agonist stimulation could have arisen from random collisions be-
tween the plasma membrane-translocated barr and any mem-
brane proteins. To control for this possibility, BRET was
measured between the membrane protein RlucII-CD8 and
GFP10-barr1/2 following agonist-stimulation of b2AR, b2V2R or
V2R (Figure 4A). In this setup, no BRET response was observed
following agonist stimulation of any of the receptors indicating
that the BRET detected between barr and both Gas and Gg2 re-
flects molecular proximity consistent with the formation of meg-
aplexes (Figures 4B–4E). Taken together, these experiments
provide further evidence that megaplexes containing receptor,
barr and Gs form robustly at both the b2V2R and V2R.

 GPCR-barr Fusion Proteins Activate Heterotrimeric G
Protein following Agonist Stimulation
The BRET and confocal data shown thus far support the exis-
tence of megaplexes and suggest that these complexes occur
more readily for the class B GPCRs, b2V2R and V2R, and mini-
mally for the class A b2AR. However, these results do not
demonstrate whether GPCR-barr complexes can directly acti-
vate G protein. To investigate whether GPCR–barr complexes
can interact with, and activate, G protein in a cellular environ-
ment we generated fusion proteins of GPCR–barr and investi-
gated their ability to activate Gs in HEK293 cells. We used the
b2V2R as our model class B GPCR to be consistent with the bio-
physical experiments in this study where we assessed the ability
of a purified b2V2R-barr1 complex to interact with, and activate,
Gs (see below). To date, we have been unable to purify bio-
chemically functional GPCR-barr complexes using other class
B GPCRs, such as the V2R. The b2V2R has been rigorously char-
acterized both herein and in previous studies; it displays similar
biological properties to the V2R, as well as to other class B

ANOVA was performed to determine significant differences between CD8 condition and Gas or Gg2 for each time point (a p < 0.05; b p < 0.01; c p < 0.001;
d p < 0.0001).

GPCRs, and has been routinely used as
a robust model class B GPCR (Lee et al.,
2016; Oakley et al., 1999, 2000; Tohgo
et al., 2003).
Initially, we tested the functionality and stability of the b2V2R–
barr1/2 fusions. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of the FLAG-tagged
fusion proteins, expressed in HEK293 cells, confirmed that the
fusions were intact and not subjected to cellular cleavage (Fig-
ures S4A and S4B). When compared with b2V2R, ISO-promoted
displacement of 125I-cyanopidolol (CYP) binding for both b2V2R–
barr1/2 fusions revealed a biphasic curve reflecting a higher
affinity state for agonist (Figure 5A): b2V2R–barr1 dissociation
constant logKiHi = �7.11 ± 0.03 (41%) and logKiLo = 6.01 ±
0.03 (59%); and b2V2R–barr2 dissociation constant logKiHi =
�8.29 ± 0.03 (49%) and logKiLo = �6.47 ± 0.03 (51%). These re-
sults are characteristic of the allosteric effect of barr on receptor
binding properties, as previously reported (Gurevich et al., 1997),
and confirm the functional interaction between the two moieties
of the fusions. Fusion to barr had no effect on the affinity of the
antagonist ICI-118551 (Figure 5A). When expressed in HEK293
cells both fusions constitutively internalize resulting in a relatively
low amount of b2V2R–barr1/2 fusions being present at the cell
membrane (Figure 5B). This internalization pattern further shows

 that barr, as a fusion partner, retains its functionality to promote
barr-mediated receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, when stimu-
lated with ISO, the b2V2R–barr1/2 fusions promote ERK1/2 phos-
phorylation at 10 min post-stimulation (Figures 5C and S4C).
These results indicate that both individual proteins, of the
b2V2R–barr1/2 fusions, are functional when expressed in cells.
To test whether b2V2R, as part of the b2V2R–barr fusions, re-
tains its ability to activate Gs, changes in BRET were measured
between RlucII-117-Gas and GFP10-Gg1 in response to ISO
stimulation as compared to vehicle treatment. As shown in Fig-
ure 5D, ISO stimulation of b2V2R–barr1/2 induced a decreased
BRET between RlucII-117-Gas and GFP10-Gg1, reflective of
the Gs subunits separation and activation, although to a lesser
extent than non-fused b2V2R. These results demonstrate that
both b2V2R–barr1/2 fusions can activate Gs to some degree,
following agonist-mediated receptor stimulation, despite their
constant coupling to functional barr1/2.
To further confirm the ability of the b2V2R–barr1/2 fusions to
activate Gs, real-time kinetic studies of ISO-stimulated cAMP
production were undertaken. Both b2V2R–barr1/2 fusions were
able to initiate Gs signaling (Figure 5E), providing further support
that G proteins are capable of being activated by GPCR–barr
complexes.
In Vitro Formation and Isolation of Megaplexes
To further investigate whether GPCRs can form megaplexes by
simultaneously interacting with barr and heterotrimeric G pro-
tein, we attempted to form such megaplexes in vitro and to
then isolate them by co-immunoprecipitation (coIP). For this
study, we used the FLAG-b2V2R expression construct to form
stable complexes with barr1 in sf9 insect cells, as previously
described (Shukla et al., 2014). Following stimulation with the
high-affinity agonist, BI-167107 (BI), b2V2R forms appreciable
amounts of complex with barr1 that can be purified by affinity pu-
rification and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). To obtain
highly
stable
b2V2R–barr1
complexes,
that
remain
intact
throughout the purification, we added the conformationally
active antibody binder, Fab30, which binds to and stabilizes
active barr1 conformations (Shukla et al., 2013, 2014). We
were unable to obtain monodispersed and functional V2R–
barr1 complexes using this approach (data not shown).
To test whether this Fab30-stabilized BI-occupied b2V2R–
barr1 complex (Fab30 complex) interacts with the heterotri-
meric Gs, we added purified Gs in excess to the Fab30 com-
plex and pulled-down the FLAG-b2V2R using M1 anti-FLAG
beads. As shown in Figure 6A, barr1 and all three components
of the heterotrimeric Gs (Gas, Gb1, and Gg2) were pulled-
down together with FLAG-b2V2R in a stoichiometric fashion.
A
similar
result
was
observed
when
using
protein
A/G
agarose beads, which bind Fab30, to pull-down the individual
components of the megaplex, confirming that it forms in vitro
(Figure 6A).
Megaplex In Vitro Functionality
To test the functionality of the receptor in the megaplex we first
investigated whether binding of the heterotrimeric Gs to the
Fab30 complex is agonist-dependent by FLAG-tag coIP (Fig-
ure 6C). The Fab30 complex was able to bind Gs to a similar
extent as agonist BI-bound b2V2R (Figures 6C and S5A). In
contrast, the antagonist carazolol (Cz)-bound b2V2R had almost
no ability to bind Gs indicating that the binding of the heterotri-
meric Gs to b2V2R in the Fab30 complex is dependent on an
agonist-stabilized active receptor conformation (Figures 6C
and S5A).
We next investigated whether the b2V2R maintains its guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) functionality with respect to
the heterotrimeric Gs when residing in the megaplex. To assess
GEF functionality, the megaplex was formed in the presence of
either GDP or non-hydrolysable GTPgS. An exchange of GDP
to GTPgS in the heterotrimeric Gs causes activation of the Gas
subunit and separation from the Gbg subunits (Figure 6B). This
separation event was followed by a FLAG-tag coIP. The addition
of GDP caused a small decrease in Gs binding to the BI-occu-
pied b2V2R and Fab30 complex (Figures 6D and S5B). However,
the addition of GTPgS led to a nearly complete separation of the
Gas subunit from both the BI-occupied b2V2R and Fab30 com-
plex (Figures 6D and S5B). This dramatic effect indicates that
the receptor retains its GEF functionality while residing in the
megaplex and can promote G protein activation and separation.
Interestingly, unlike the Gas subunit, the Gbg subunits remained
in complex with both the Fab30 complex and BI-occupied b2V2R
after GTPgS treatment (Figure S5B).

ANOVA was performed to assess significant differences between control buffer (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ****p < 0.0001) and GDP (####, p < 0.0001). There were no
statistical differences between the BI-occupied b2V2R-Gs complex and the megaplex.

(**p < 0.01; ****p < 0.0001), and one-way ANOVA tests the effect on Gs modulation by different receptor/complex concentrations (#, p < 0.05; ####, p < 0.0001).

 Once activated by the receptor, the Gas subunits display
intrinsic GTPase activity. To further characterize the b2V2R
functionality in the megaplex, modulation of Gs, measured as
GTPase activity by the Fab30 complex, was investigated. As
shown in Figure 6E, the Fab30 complex does indeed positively
modulate the GTPase activity of the Gs, and to a similar level
as the BI-occupied b2V2R control.
These in vitro experiments clearly show that the receptor, in
the megaplex, retains its full capability to both interact with
and to activate heterotrimeric Gs.
Structural Studies of the Megaplex Using Electron
Microscopy
To investigate the architecture of the megaplex, we formed com-
plexes on a preparative scale and isolated them by SEC (Figures
S6A and S6B). To increase the overall stability and homogeneity
of the megaplex preparation, we employed two strategies, which
were previously utilized to form stable b2AR–Gs complexes (Ras-
mussen et al., 2011): (1) we removed GDP from the heterotrimeric

Gs by addition of apyrase; and (2) we stabilized
the nucleotide-free transition state of the Gs,
which is known to interact strongly with the
b2AR transmembrane core region by adding
the conformationally active nanobody binder,
Nb35. These two strategies resulted in a stable
and monodisperse preparation of megaplexes
as assessed by SEC and conventional nega-
tive-stain EM (Figures 7 and S6) (Peisley and
Skiniotis, 2015). The b2V2R construct used for
our in vitro studies was engineered to contain
an
N-terminal
T4-lysozyme
fusion,
(T4L)
b2V2R, which can be used as a marker for re-
ceptor orientation
in EM
studies (Shukla
et al., 2014; Westfield et al., 2011).
To visualize the structure of the in vitro re-
constituted megaplex we applied classifica-
tion and averaging of the EM particle pro-
jections (Figure S6C). The class averages
revealed a complex architecture with distinct
features that allow domain assignment, with
the T4L marking the receptor extracellular
face and the heterotrimeric Gs bound diamet-
rically opposite at the intracellular side of b2V2R, in a configura-
tion that appears identical to the previously characterized (T4L)
b2AR–Gs (Figures 7B and 7C) (Westfield et al., 2011). Additional
density attributed to barr1-Fab30 is observed on the side of the
b2V2R–Gs complex. This configuration of barr1, which interacts
with the phosphorylated b2V2R C-terminal tail, is reminiscent of
the ‘tail’ conformation of the (T4L)b2V2R–barr1-Fab30 complex
that we previously reported by EM (Shukla et al., 2014). In fact,
overlaying the averages of the (T4L)b2AR–Gs complex and the
‘tail’ configuration of the (T4L)b2V2R–barr1-Fab30 complex (us-
ing receptor and T4L densities as the common features) results
in a projection that appears almost identical to the one of the
megaplex (Figures 7B and 7C). In this super-complex, barr1
is positioned adjacent to the Gbg subunits and several class
averages indicate a direct interface between Gbg and barr1 (Fig-
ure S6C). This possible Gbg–barr1 interaction was further
explored by glutathione sepharose (GST) pull-down assays,
whereby an interaction between the GST-barr1, in complex
with Fab30 and the phosphorylated V2R C-terminal peptide
916

 (V2Rpp), and heterotrimeric Gs was observed (Figure S7). Inter-
estingly, when the Gbg subunits were separated from the Gas
subunit

�, Gbg binds GST-barr1 more prominently whereas
Gas subunit association with GST-barr1 diminishes (Figures
S7B and S7C). These results suggest that a direct interaction
occurs between barr1 and Gbg subunits. Consistent with this
finding, we further demonstrated that expression of the Gbg
scavenger, T8-bARKct, significantly reduced the b2V2R-stimu-
lated BRET response between RlucII-Gg2 and GFP10-barr1 in
HEK293 cells (Figure S7D).
DISCUSSION
Sustained G protein signaling by internalized GPCRs has been
difficult to incorporate within the classical understanding of
GPCR signaling since receptor internalization is thought to be
driven by the formation of GPCR-barr complexes and because
barr plays a fundamental role in the desensitization of GPCR-
mediated G protein signaling. Thus, we found it surprising that
class B GPCRs, including PTHR, V2R, and TSHR, which are
known to interact tightly with barr, have been shown to promote
sustained G protein signaling from internalized compartments
(Calebiro et al., 2009; Feinstein et al., 2013; Ferrandon et al.,
2009; Wehbi et al., 2013). In the current study we directly
demonstrate that by exchanging the C-terminal tail of the
b2AR with the V2R C-terminal tail (b2V2R), the receptor internal-
ization pattern changes from class A to B and that the b2V2R
chimera displays behavior similar to the V2R (Figures 3A and
S2) (Oakley et al., 1999, 2000). Interestingly, as observed with
the V2R, this modification significantly enhances the ability of
the b2V2R, relative to b2AR, to promote sustained G protein
activation and signaling from internalized compartments (Fig-
ures 1 and 2). Previous findings suggest a role for barr in sus-
tained G protein signaling by the PTHR and V2R. Co-expression
of a constitutively active version of barr1 enhances sustained
G protein signaling at the PTHR and V2R, and such signaling
was diminished by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown
of both barr1/2 (Feinstein et al., 2011, 2013; Wehbi et al.,
2013). In contrast, for the class A GPCR, b2AR, desensitization
of Gs signaling is enhanced by a constitutively active barr1, but
diminished by siRNA knockdown of barr1/2 (Violin et al., 2008;
Wehbi et al., 2013).
How is barr involved in receptor-mediated G protein activation
at internalized GPCRs? Several studies with the PTHR, V2R,
TSHR, d opioid, and CCR1 (Audet et al., 2012; Calebiro et al.,
2009; Feinstein et al., 2013; Ferrandon et al., 2009; Gilliland
et al., 2013; Wehbi et al., 2013) indirectly support our megaplex
hypothesis for GPCRs. In the present study, however, we pro-
vide direct evidence for formation of megaplexes; super-com-
plexes in which the heterotrimeric Gs subunits come into close
proximity with barr1/2 following stimulation of the b2V2R or V2R
(Figure 4). This event seems to occur at internalized receptors
(Figure 3). Furthermore, following agonist addition, b2V2R-
barr1/2 fusions retain the ability to activate Gs and promote
signaling (Figures 5 and S4). We demonstrated in vitro that the
receptor in a purified agonist-occupied b2V2R-barr1-Fab30
complex interacts strongly with heterotrimeric Gs through its
transmembrane core, while it couples simultaneously with
barr1 through the receptor C-terminal tail (Figures 6 and 7).
This megaplex architecture allows the receptor to promote
GDP-GTP exchange and to activate Gs (Figures 6, S5, and S6)
and thus explains how barr can drive receptor internalization
without interfering with G protein coupling to the receptor.
Why does barr partake in sustained internalized G protein
activation at class B GPCRs, while desensitizing it at others,
such as the prototypical class A GPCR, b2AR? The current study
suggests that a strong interaction between the GPCR C-terminal
tail and barr is required to robustly form a megaplex (Figures 4, 6,
and 7). To obtain a highly stable b2V2R-barr1 complex, used for
the aforementioned structural studies, this complex was engi-
neered to have a strong interaction between the receptor C-ter-
minal tail and barr1, which was accomplished by exchanging the
b2AR C-terminal tail with the V2R C-terminal tail and stabilizing
the active conformation of barr1 with Fab30 (Shukla et al.,
2014). b2V2R and barr1 only interact through the V2R C-terminal
tail region in the ‘‘tail’’ conformation, which is the arrangement
that allows the receptor to interact with Gs. Thus, in order to
form megaplexes, it might be a requirement for GPCRs to have
a C-terminal tail that promotes a strong interaction with barr
following phosphorylation. Class B GPCRs have been reported
to contain highly conserved serine/threonine phosphorylation
site clusters in their C-terminal tails, which are critical for the
formation of highly stable GPCR–barr complexes (Oakley et al.,
2001; Vilardaga et al., 2002). Therefore, a dependency on a
strong C-terminal tail interaction, that promotes the ‘‘tail’’ confor-
mation, could explain why class B GPCRs form megaplexes that
lead to G protein signaling from internalized compartments. On
the other hand, class A GPCRs lack serine/threonine clusters
at their C-terminal tails and, thus, promote a transient interaction
between the GPCR C-terminal tail and barr (Oakley et al., 2001).
Therefore, formation of class A GPCR-barr complexes, might be
dependent on the interaction between the receptor transmem-
brane core and barr, which would explain why class A GPCRs
only form megaplexes to a limited degree.
Overall, our results indicate that megaplexes of a single
class B GPCR, barr, and heterotrimeric G protein exist and
may explain the recently appreciated phenomenon of sustained
G protein signaling from endosomes.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Real-Time Measurement of cAMP Production
HEK293-ICUE2 cell lines transiently transfected with GPCRs were imaged
in the dark, on a 37�C temperature-controlled stage, and for the entire stimu-
lation experiment by using a DeltaVision Deconvolution microscope (GE
Healthcare) with a Coolsnap HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics) controlled by
SoftWoRx 6.1 (GE Healthcare). Dual-emission ratio imaging used a CFP/YFP
dichroic mirror and 470 ± 24 nm and 535 ± 25 nm emission filters for CFP
and YFP, respectively.
BRET Assay
Following agonist stimulation, transfected HEK293 cells were incubated at
37�C and luciferase substrate coelenterazine 400a was added 5 min prior to
reading BRET in a Synergy Neo microplate reader (BioTek) equipped with an
acceptor filter (515 ± 30 nm) and donor filter (410 ± 80 nm). The BRET signal
was determined as the ratio of light emitted by GFP10-tagged biosensors (en-
ergy acceptors) and light emitted by RlucII-tagged biosensors (energy donors).
Cell 166, 907–919, August 11, 2016

 Confocal Microscopy
HEK293 cells transfected with fluorescence protein were fixed with ice-cold
6% formaldehyde diluted in DPBS prior to, or at different time points, during
stimulation of the GPCRs. Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss
LSM510 laser-scanning microscope using multi-track sequential excitation
(488, 568, and 633 nm) and emission (515–540, 585–615, and 650 nm) filter
sets.
Co-immunoprecipitation of In Vitro Complexes
Fab30 complex, BI-b2V2R, or Cz-b2V2R were mixed with Gs in a molar ratio of
1:1.5 in presence of control buffer, 100 nM BI, 100 nM Cz, 20 mM GDP,
or 20 mM GTPgS. Next, FLAG-b2V2R was immobilized on M1 anti-FLAG
agarose beads followed by extensive wash. Finally, FLAG-b2V2R and associ-
ated proteins were eluted by elution buffer containing 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide.
Megaplex Preparation for Structural Studies
To form stable megaplexes, Fab30 complex was incubated with Gs and Nb35
in a molar ratio of 1:1.5:3 for 1 hr at room temperature. Megaplex was treated
with 25 mU/ml of apyrase for 1 hr, and the CaCl2 concentration was adjusted to
4 mM. Finally, the megaplex was purified on an SEC column (Superdex 200,
16/600, GE Healthcare).
Electron Microscopy
Megaplexes were prepared for EM using conventional uranyl formate nega-
tive staining. The negative-stained sample was imaged at room temperature
with a Tecnai T12 electron microscope operated at 120 kV using low-
dose procedures. Images were recorded at a magnification of 71,1383
and a defocus value of �1.5 mm on a Gatan US4000 CCD camera. All
images were binned (2 3 2 pixels) to obtain a pixel size of 4.16 A
˚ on the
specimen level.
