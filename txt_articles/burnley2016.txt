Abstract
The duration that exercise can be maintained decreases as the power requirements increase. In this review, we describe the
power–duration (PD) relationship across the full range of attainable power outputs in humans. We show that a remarkably
small range of power outputs is sustainable (power outputs below the critical power, CP). We also show that the origin of
neuromuscular fatigue differs considerably depending on the exercise intensity domain in which exercise is performed. In
the moderate domain (below the lactate threshold, LT), fatigue develops slowly and is predominantly of central origin
(residing in the central nervous system). In the heavy domain (above LT but below CP), both central and peripheral
(muscle) fatigue are observed. In this domain, fatigue is frequently correlated with the depletion of muscle glycogen.
Severe-intensity exercise (above the CP) is associated with progressive derangements of muscle metabolic homeostasis and
consequent peripheral fatigue. To counter these effects, muscle activity increases progressively, as does pulmonary oxygen
uptake ( ˙
VO2), with task failure being associated with the attainment of ˙
VO2 max. Although the loss of homeostasis and
thus fatigue develop more rapidly the higher the power output is above CP, the metabolic disturbance and the degree of
peripheral fatigue reach similar values at task failure. We provide evidence that the failure to continue severe-intensity
exercise is a physiological phenomenon involving multiple interacting mechanisms which indicate a mismatch between
neuromuscular power demand and instantaneous power supply. Valid integrative models of fatigue must account for the
PD relationship and its physiological basis.
Keywords: Endurance, fatigue, physiology, performance
Introduction
The ability of humans and other species to endure
physical exercise has been a source of fascination
since antiquity. This interest extends from simply
describing the relationship between power output or
locomotory speed and endurance time to the study
of the purported physiological, mechanical, and
psychological bases of endurance. The relationship
between power output and exercise duration (the
power–duration (PD) relationship) has been studied
since the turn of the twentieth century and applies
to constant-power output exercise (for reviews, see
Burnley & Jones, 2007; Jones, Vanhatalo, Burnley,
Morton, & Poole, 2010), all-out exercise (Vanhatalo,
Doust, & Burnley, 2007), and self-paced exercise
(Chidnok, DiMenna, Bailey et al., 2013). Four ‘exer-
cise intensity domains’ can be identified spanning the
PD relationship, and the intensity domain in which
the exercise task is performed dictates the type (and
degree) of fatigue experienced. The purpose of this
review is to detail the character of this PD relation-
ship, the fatigue mechanisms which underpin it,
and the events that lead to task failure across the exer-
cise intensity spectrum. We will also briefly compare
the predictions derived from the PD relationship with
models of exercise performance outlined in other
reviews. Our view is that any valid integrated model
of fatigue must incorporate the physiological and per-
formance characteristics enshrined within the PD
relationship.
The limit of human endurance during constant-
power exercise, that is, the point at which a partici-
pant is unwilling or unable to continue a physical
task, has been referred to as the point of ‘exhaustion’,

 ‘the limit of tolerance’, or the point of ‘fatigue’. We
prefer the term ‘task failure’ to describe this event,
as the task itself, and the criteria for failing to main-
tain it, can be rigorously defined under experimental
conditions. Regardless of the underlying mechan-
isms, the characteristics of the relationship between
power output (or speed) and time to task failure are
intuitively obvious: first, maximal neuromuscular
power can only be maintained for at most a few
seconds; second, humans have a high capacity to
sustain exercise if the power (or speed) requirements
are relatively low; and third, between these two
extremes, the sustainable power output declines in a
characteristic
curvilinear
pattern.
As
shown
in
Figure 1, healthy young male participants can
produce
about
1000 W during
maximal
efforts
(although values in excess of 2000 W may be
observed in elite sprint cyclists; Gardener, Martin,
Matin,
Barras,
&
Jenkins,
2007),
whilst
the
maximum sustainable power (estimated by the criti-
cal power (CP), see below) is usually no more than
25–35% of the maximal power (Conley, Kemper, &
Crowther, 2001; Vanhatalo et al., 2007), equivalent
to ∼70% of the power output associated with
maximal oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2max). Thus, almost
70% of the power-generating capacity of the neuro-
muscular system is unsustainable and will result in
task failure within minutes of beginning an exercise
task (Bundle & Weyand, 2012), whereas tasks per-
formed at lower power outputs can be continued
for many hours (e.g. Davies & Thompson, 1986;
Martin et al., 2010). The ‘bandwidth’ of sustainable
power is, therefore, surprisingly small. Above this
sustainable power, the tolerable duration of exercise
can be accurately predicted using very simple math-
ematical equations that describe the PD relationship.
Several formulations of the relationship between
power output and endurance time (time to task
failure) exist in the literature, including power law
models
(Garcia-Manso,
Martín-González,
Vaa-
monde, & Da Silva-Gigoletto, 2012; Kennelly,
1906), exponential decay functions (Weyand, Lin,
& Bundle, 2006; Wilkie, 1960), and hyperbolic
models
(Monod
&
Scherrer,
1965;
Moritani,
Nagata, deVries, & Muro, 1981; Morton, 2006).
There is no clear answer to the question of which
mathematical model best fits the PD relationship,
and it is beyond the scope of the present review to
provide such an answer. However, it is our view
that hyperbolic formulations of the PD relationship
come closest to achieving both a ‘good fit’ to the
underlying data and a reasonable approximation of
the underlying physiology (Jones et al., 2010; Poole,
Burnley,
Vanhatalo,
Rossiter,
&
Jones,
2016).
Power law functions predict no asymptotic behaviour

The x-axis in (a) provides the entire range of attainable power
output in a typical fit young (but not specifically trained) partici-
pant. The exercise intensity domains and their physiological
boundary points are annotated, as is the ˙
VO2 max value of the par-
ticipant. Note the large range of power outputs that are non-
steady state and thus unsustainable (all power outputs above
CP). In (b), the PD relationship of the same participant is
plotted from four constant-power trials performed to task
failure. The intensity domains are also annotated for comparison.
In (c), the ˙
VO2 responses to moderate, heavy, and severe-inten-
sity exercise are plotted, with steady states being attained for mod-
erate and heavy exercise (the latter delayed by the ˙
VO2 slow
component), whereas no steady state is evident in the severe-
intensity domain. Instead, the continued increase in ˙
VO2 is con-
strained by the attainment of ˙
VO2 max.

 indicative of distinct exercise intensity domains, even
though the existence of such is well accepted
(Gaesser & Poole, 1996; Whipp, 1994; see below).
Exponential functions usually characterise continu-
ous temporal processes in which the value of a
datum is dependent on the value of its predecessor.
PD curves are usually not of this form, since each
datum represents a discrete exercise test. We will,
therefore, focus our attention on the hyperbolic
form of the PD relationship (Figure 1 (b)):
Tlim = W ′/(P − CP),
(1)
where Tlim is the time to task failure, W ′ is the curva-
ture constant parameter, and CP is the critical power
(see Morton, 2006, for the detailed mathematical
basis of the PD relationship). W ′ represents a finite
amount of work that can be done when exercise is
performed to task failure within the severe domain
(Jones et al., 2010).
Intensity dependence of fatigue processes
The characteristic bioenergetic response to exercise
varies as a function of the intensity domain in which
the exercise in question is performed (for reviews,
see Burnley & Jones, 2007; Gaesser & Poole, 1996;
Poole & Jones 2012; Whipp, 1994). Four intensity
domains have so far been identified, namely moder-
ate (power outputs below the lactate threshold,
LT), heavy (power outputs between LT and CP),
severe (power outputs above CP that can be sustained
until ˙
VO2 max is attained), and extreme (power
output resulting in task failure before ˙
VO2 max is
attained). In each domain, the time course of the
˙
VO2 response (i.e. the kinetics) differs, with moder-
ate-intensity exercise being the only domain in
which a steady state is attained within 2–3 min of
exercise onset. In the heavy domain, the steady
state is delayed by the emergence of a ˙
VO2 slow com-
ponent, which increases the O2 cost of exercise and
results in 10–20 min being required for a steady
state to be established. In severe-intensity exercise,
no steady state is possible, and ˙
VO2 rises to the
˙
VO2
max. Extreme-intensity
exercise represents
those work rates for which task failure occurs before
˙
VO2 reaches ˙
VO2 max. The stark differences in the
˙
VO2 responses in each domain are mirrored in the
muscle metabolic and blood acid–base responses
(Jones, Wilkerson, DiMenna, Fulford, & Poole,
2008; Poole, Ward, Gardner, & Whipp, 1988; Van-
hatalo et al., 2016), which suggests that distinct
fatigue mechanisms may also characterise each inten-
sity domain. There is a paucity of fatigue-related
mechanistic studies performed in the moderate and
extreme-intensity domains and we will therefore
focus most of our attention on fatigue and exercise
tolerance in the heavy and severe domains (immedi-
ately below and above the CP, respectively).
Fatigue during exercise below the CP
Although physiological responses to moderate and
heavy-intensity exercise are easy to distinguish, the
fatigue processes and mechanisms of exercise limit-
ation are more difficult to separate. This is largely
due to the lack of exhaustive exercise data in the mod-
erate-intensity domain, because, at these work rates
(<LT), exercise can be continued for more than
3 h, and consequently these tasks are almost always
terminated before task failure occurs. Nevertheless,
the growing popularity of ultra-endurance compe-
titions has led to a small number of studies investi-
gating physiological responses and fatigue processes
during prolonged moderate-intensity exercise (e.g.
Davies & Thompson, 1986; Lepers, Maffiuletti,
Rochette, Brugniaux, & Millet, 2002; Martin et al.,
2010). In contrast, there are numerous studies that
have been conducted in the heavy-intensity domain,
including many of the classic studies of exercise
metabolism and thermoregulation (e.g. Bergström,
Hermansen,
Hultman,
&
Saltin,
1967;
Costill,
Bowers, Branam, & Sparks, 1971).
The physiological and fatigue responses to very pro-
longed moderate exercise have been assessed during
both running (Davies & Thompson, 1986) and
cycling (Lepers et al., 2002). Davies and Thompson
(1986) studied 10 ultramarathon runners who were
tasked with running on a treadmill at the highest
pace they could sustain for 4 h. This was estimated
to be 65–70% ˙
VO2max, or the upper limit of the mod-
erate domain in these trained runners. These partici-
pants exercised with blood [lactate] and respiratory
exchange ratio (RER) remaining at resting levels
throughout the task, confirming that the exercise was
moderate. Nevertheless, the pulmonary ˙
VO2 response
gradually rose during exercise, and this increase
amounted to ∼390 mL min−1 in the last 3 h of
running. This increased O2 cost of exercise developed
much more slowly than the ˙
VO2 slow component
associated with heavy exercise, despite being similar
in amplitude (the rate of increase was ∼2 mL min−2,
at least an order of magnitude lower than the typical
trajectory of slow components in the heavy or severe
domains; Burnley, Davison, & Baker, 2011; Gaesser
& Poole, 1996). The increase in energy expenditure
does, however, imply that as exercise progressed,
muscle bioenergetic and/or motor unit recruitment
alterations were required to sustain the task (Gollnick,
Piehl, & Saltin, 1974). For example, ˙
VO2 will increase

 during prolonged exercise in part due to a shift
towards fatty acid utilisation, which has a lower P:O
ratio than carbohydrate. However, in the case of
Davies and Thompson (1986), the change in RER
was relatively small (from ∼0.84 to ∼0.79), suggesting
that only ∼50 mL min−1 of the above increase could
be accounted for by changes in substrate utilisation.
Much of the increase in ˙
VO2 thus appears to be a
response to neuromuscular fatigue.
Fatigue has been assessed during moderate-inten-
sity exercise by measurement of the loss of maximal
voluntary contraction (MVC) force, the reduction in
force in response to peripheral muscle or nerve stimu-
lation (to measure peripheral fatigue), or the increased
force in response to the superimposition of electrical
stimuli on MVCs (to quantify the reduction in volun-
tary activation percentage and thus central fatigue; for
areview, see Gandevia, 2001). At the conclusion of 4 h
of treadmill running, Davies and Thompson (1986)
observed a 25% reduction in MVC force, but no
change in tetanic force output in response to periph-
eral stimulation. They therefore concluded that the
loss of MVC force had a central origin. Other work
supports the predominance of central fatigue during
prolonged,
moderate-intensity
running
(Martin
et al., 2010) and cycling (Lepers et al., 2002).
Whether this limits performance is not clear, since
these studies were all continued for a fixed distance
or duration rather than to task failure.
When the LT is exceeded, exercise tolerance is
limited to between ∼40 min and ∼3 h (Coyle,
Coggan, Hemmert, & Ivy, 1986). These heavy-
intensity power outputs typically range from 60%
to 85% ˙
VO2max. The crucial features of the physio-
logical response to heavy exercise are the develop-
ment of the ˙
VO2 slow component and an increase
in blood [lactate], both of which eventually stabilise.
Fatigue
of
both
global
and
peripheral
origin
undoubtedly occurs during heavy-intensity exercise:
at task failure following heavy cycle ergometry, the
isometric MVC declines to ∼75% of its initial
value (Sahlin & Seger, 1995), and during one hour
of non-exhaustive intermittent isometric contrac-
tions, the MVC is reduced to 65–70% of baseline
(Burnley, Vanhatalo, & Jones, 2012). In the latter
study, we demonstrated that peripheral fatigue
developed progressively, albeit more slowly in com-
parison to that observed during severe-intensity
exercise (see below). A variety of processes may
underpin the development of peripheral fatigue
during heavy exercise, including the production of
reactive oxygen species, K+ accumulation, and gly-
cogen depletion which, alone or in combination,
ultimately results in excitation–contraction coupling
failure at the fibre level (for a review, see Allen,
Lamb, & Westerblad, 2008).
The depletion of muscle glycogen may be central
to the fatigue processes of heavy-intensity exercise.
The higher O2 cost of exercise that results from the
development of the ˙
VO2 slow component implies
that the body’s finite energy reserves (chiefly muscle
glycogen) will be utilised at a greater rate, and task
failure in this domain is often associated with low
muscle [glycogen] (Bergström et al., 1967; Coyle
et al., 1986; Gollnick et al., 1974). In addition,
fatigue-related metabolites (such as ADP, Pi, and
H+) do not accumulate
as exercise progresses
(Jones et al., 2008), in spite of the fact that peripheral
fatigue gradually develops (Burnley et al., 2012;
Sahlin & Seger, 1995). During heavy exercise,
muscle glycogen is utilised by both type I and type
II fibres (Gollnick et al., 1974). The recruitment of
both type I and type II motor units during heavy exer-
cise has also been inferred from measurements of a
single
fibre
(phosphorylcreatine
(PCr))
during
exhaustive (Sahlin, Söderlund, Tonkonogi & Hira-
koba, 1997) and non-exhaustive cycling (Krustrup,
Söderlund, Mohr, & Bangsbo, 2004). These studies
demonstrate that both fibre types are activated early
in heavy-intensity exercise, but that muscle high-
energy phosphate concentrations do not systemati-
cally fall as exercise progresses. Nevertheless, a
small population of fibres experience considerable
metabolic
stress
as
exercise
progresses
(be
it
through PCr or glycogen depletion), with the fall in
their power output necessitating the recruitment of
additional, predominantly type II muscle fibres in
order to sustain exercise (Krustrup et al., 2004).
It is only relatively recently that the mechanistic
basis of the fatiguing effects of glycogen depletion
has come to light (for a review, see Ørtenblad, Wes-
terblad & Nielsen, 2013). It is sometimes assumed
that glycogen depletion is not limiting exercise per-
formance because glycogen does not fall to zero and
is not associated with significant diminutions in cellu-
lar [ATP] (e.g. Noakes & St Clair Gibson, 2004).
However, myocyte ATP stores are compartmenta-
lised, with [ATP] in the triadic junction being depen-
dent on membrane-bound glycolytic enzymes (Han,
Thieleczek, Varsányi, & Heilmeyer, 1992). The
intra-myofibrillar store, often the first to be depleted
during exercise, serves the triad junction (Nielsen,
Holmberg, Schrøder, Saltin, & Ørtenblad, 2011).
Thus, depletion of this particular store likely results
in triadic ATP depletion without significantly impact-
ing overall myocyte [ATP] (Han et al., 1992). The
net effect of this would be excitation–contraction
coupling failure in the absence of global cellular
energy depletion. The observation of a close coupling
between glycogen concentration and Ca2+ transients
supports the idea that excitation–contraction coup-
ling
during
prolonged
exercise
is
a
glycogen-

 dependent process (Chin & Allen, 1997). Therefore,
glycogen depletion may be a major contributor to
fatigue processes during heavy-intensity exercise,
and by extension to task failure.
Central fatigue also develops during heavy-inten-
sity muscular contractions (Burnley et al., 2012).
Again we refer readers to other reviews in this series
and elsewhere which cover central fatigue processes
specifically (Gandevia, 2001; Meeusen, Watson,
Hasegawa, Roelands, & Piacentini, 2006; Nybo &
Secher, 2004). A number of mechanisms could plau-
sibly contribute to the reduction in the ability to
voluntarily activate the muscle. Changes in serotonin
and/or dopamine have been suggested to play a role
in central fatigue during exercise (Meeusen et al.,
2006), but they are unlikely to play a major role in
the progressive loss of voluntary activation during
heavy-intensity exercise. The elevation in brain sero-
tonin consequent to increased plasma free fatty acid
concentration and its competition with tryptophan
for albumin binding takes considerable time (>2 h;
Nybo & Secher, 2004), and does not, therefore,
seem likely to contribute to exercise limitation in
the upper reaches of the heavy-intensity domain.
Similarly, interventions intended to alter dopamine
concentrations in the brain only seem to be effective,
if at all, during exercise in the heat (Tumilty,
Davison, Beckman, & Thatcher, 2011). As a result
of repeated activity, a reduction in motoneurone
‘gain’ could occur (i.e. the level of excitation required
to maintain motoneurone discharge rate increases;
Johnson, Edwards, Van Tongeren, & Bawa, 2004;
McNeil, Giesebrecht, Gandevia, & Taylor, 2011),
which would also contribute to central fatigue in
this intensity domain. Under these conditions, con-
tinued constant-power exercise would necessitate
increased central motor drive. Each of these mechan-
isms, in combination with those peripheral processes
noted above, would require greater effort to sustain
the task. Task failure is likely to occur when the
sum of these processes render the participant unwill-
ing or unable to continue. Importantly, the above dis-
cussion makes it clear that no single mechanism,
central or peripheral, is likely to explain neuromuscu-
lar fatigue and exercise intolerance during moderate
or heavy exercise.
Severe-intensity exercise
The principal feature of severe-intensity exercise is
that it is a non-steady state: ˙
VO2, muscle metabolic,
and blood acid–base responses all fail to stabilise
above the CP (Jones et al., 2008; Poole et al.,
1988). Exercise above CP is tolerable for less than
∼40 min,
but
the
precise
duration
of
exercise
depends upon the curvature of the PD relationship
discussed above. In the severe-intensity domain, the
˙
VO2 slow component rises to achieve ˙
VO2max close
to the point of task failure (Burnley & Jones, 2007;
Murgatroyd, Ferguson, Ward, Whipp & Rossiter,
2011; Poole et al., 1988; Whipp, 1994), even
though the power output producing this behaviour
can be considerably below that associated with the
attainment of ˙
VO2max during incremental exercise.
Importantly, the rapidity with which the ˙
VO2 slow
component
develops
increases
as
the
power
demand is increased above CP, even though its
amplitude, constrained by the prevailing ˙
VO2max,
decreases (e.g. Burnley et al., 2011). Consequently,
it is the kinetics (trajectory) of the ˙
VO2 slow com-
ponent, not its amplitude, which best represents
fatigue development in the severe-intensity domain.
Similarly, the fall in muscle [PCr], pH, and the
increase in [Pi] accelerate as contractile intensity is
increased above the CP, but – crucially – all reach
consistent values at task failure (Vanhatalo, Fulford,
DiMenna, & Jones, 2010; Figure 2).
Peripheral fatigue, measured using supramaximal
muscle stimuli at rest, also develops inexorably
above the critical torque (CT), at a rate proportional
to the torque requirement above the CT (Burnley
et al., 2012). At task failure, the degree of peripheral
fatigue is similar irrespective of the torque require-
ments or the duration of the exercise (Burnley
et al., 2012). The behavioural similarities between
peripheral
fatigue
development,
pulmonary
and
muscle
˙
VO2 kinetics, and muscle substrate and
metabolite alterations in the severe-intensity domain
should not be surprising, since these variables are
likely to be mechanistically linked (Poole et al.,
2016; Figure 2). They are all also likely to underpin,
directly or indirectly, the hyperbolic character of the
PD relationship itself. This is because metabolite-
mediated peripheral fatigue only develops progress-
ively above the CP (Burnley et al., 2012; Jones
et al., 2008; Vanhatalo et al., 2016). The reduction
in muscle pH and the increase in [Pi] have each
been repeatedly implicated in reduced muscle fibre
force, shortening velocity, Ca2+ handling (Pi), and
thus muscle power (for a review, see Allen et al.,
2008). Recently, it has been suggested that Pi and
H+ accumulation may act synergistically to reduce
muscle force (Nelson & Fitt, 2014). This is precisely
the metabolic profile observed during severe-inten-
sity exercise, with PCr and pH reaching their nadir
and Pi reaching its maximum at the point of task
failure (Jones et al., 2008; Vanhatalo et al., 2010;
Vanhatalo et al., 2016). That said, recent studies of
whole-body exercise suggest that task failure is not
necessarily associated with consistent levels of per-
ipheral
fatigue
(Johnson,
Sharpe,
Williams,
&
Power–duration relationship
5
 Hannah, 2015; Thomas, Elmeua, Howatson, &
Goodall, 2016). Notwithstanding the difficulty in
measuring metabolite-induced peripheral fatigue in
whole-body exercise (which introduces significant
delays between exercise cessation and neuromuscular
measurement), these results invite the intriguing
possibility that the degree of peripheral fatigue
reached
during
severe-intensity
exercise
may
depend somewhat on both exercise intensity and
duration.
The loss of contractile function above CP requires
the progressive recruitment of additional motor units
to maintain the power demand and thus sustain
further exercise (Burnley et al., 2012). These adjust-
ments are most likely to contribute, at least in part, to
the ˙
VO2 slow component, and would explain why the
slow component develops more rapidly above the CP
(Burnley & Jones, 2007). But these adjustments
cannot
continue
indefinitely:
the
attainment
of
˙
VO2max makes task failure inevitable because, by defi-
nition, oxidative phosphorylation cannot contribute
to
further
increases
in
energy
demand.
Once
˙
VO2max is attained, additional motor unit recruitment
will compromise muscle function by either being
reliant on substrate-level phosphorylation (exacer-
bating peripheral fatigue), or by drawing on the
now finite O2 supply (further compromising the func-
tion of the fibres under significant metabolic stress).
The tolerable duration of severe-intensity exercise
upon the attainment of ˙
VO2max is seldom more than

VO2 responses to severe-intensity exercise.
The lowest exercise intensity (power output or muscle torque) is represented by black circles, followed by white circles, black triangles,
white triangles, and black squares as the intensity is increased. The muscle activity and peripheral fatigue responses to intermittent isometric
knee-extension exercise are redrawn from Burnley et al. (2012), the PCr responses to dynamic knee-extension exercise are drawn from the
data of Vanhatalo et al. (2010), and the ˙
VO2 responses are data collected during cycle ergometry. Each plot represents the performance of four
different severe-intensity trials to task failure at a constant torque or power demand. Note that at task failure peripheral fatigue reaches con-
sistent values, PCr declines to effectively zero, and pulmonary ˙
VO2 reaches ˙
VO2 max. Only muscle activity (surface EMG recordings of the
vastus lateralis) shows different values at task failure, suggesting that despite differing degrees of neuromuscular activation, the respiratory,
metabolic, and fatigue processes collectively reach limiting values at task failure.

 a few minutes and is often considerably less (Hill,
Poole, & Smith, 2002; Figure 2). Against this back-
ground, it is tempting to ascribe the mechanism(s)
producing task failure during exercise above the CP
to metabolic factors alone: muscle PCr and pH
reach low, possibly limiting values (Hogan, Richard-
son, & Haseler, 1999; Jones et al., 2008; Vanhatalo
et al., 2010), and Pi rises to levels that have
been shown to compromise contractile function and
Ca2+ kinetics (Allen et al., 2008). However, this
provides an incomplete picture of the circumstances
that attend task failure in severe-intensity exercise.
The accumulation of metabolites (such as Pi,
lactate, H+, and K+) in the muscle and interstitium
during severe-intensity exercise may not simply com-
promise contractile and ionic function. The appear-
ance of metabolites in the interstitial space exposes
them to the receptive fields of free nerve endings of
thinly myelinated or unmyelinated afferents (group
III and group IV afferents, respectively), which are
sensitive to both mechanical and metabolic stimuli
(Amann, Sidhu, Weavil, Mangumb, & Venturelli,
2015). Recently, a role for these afferents in limiting
central motor drive has been proposed, as reviewed
in this issue and elsewhere (Amann, 2011). Addition-
ally, if motoneurone gain is reduced during severe-
intensity exercise (McNeil et al., 2011), simply
maintaining
a
given
level
of
muscle activation
requires a greater degree of excitatory synaptic
input. In the latter stages of severe-intensity exercise,
therefore, the recruited motor units are both fatiguing
and becoming intrinsically harder to drive, and the
central nervous system (CNS) is receiving increasing
levels of inhibitory feedback. Under these circum-
stances, task failure would occur if the increased
excitatory input (motor drive) does not adequately
compensate for the loss of power and excitability
(Dideriksen, Enoka, & Farina, 2011).
A further important facet of the physiological
response to ‘whole-body’ severe-intensity exercise
is the extent to which it places acute stress on
other organ systems, particularly the respiratory
and cardiovascular systems. That ˙
VO2max is attained
in the latter stages of severe exercise is evidence
enough of the stress placed on the cardiovascular
system; but in the last 10–15 years, an important
role of the respiratory system for severe-intensity
exercise tolerance has become apparent (Romer &
Polkey, 2008). Specifically, the inability to prevent
the fall in arterial pH means that minute ventilation
increases dramatically during severe exercise, due
primarily to an increase in breathing frequency
(Poole et al., 1988). This increases the O2 cost of
breathing, and may eventually result in respiratory
muscle
fatigue
(Johnson,
Babcock,
Suman,
&
Dempsey, 1993; Taylor & Romer, 2008). The
former adds to the amplitude of the ˙
VO2 slow com-
ponent (Cross, Sabapathy, Schneider, & Haseler,
2010) and the latter compromises limb blood flow
either by stealing cardiac output from the muscle,
or
by
metaboreflex-induced
vasoconstriction
(Romer & Polkey, 2008). Both effects would most
likely exacerbate the metabolic stress within the
muscle, directly or indirectly compromising exercise
tolerance.
What causes task failure during
severe-intensity exercise?
The
consistent
observation
of
hyperbolic
PD
relationships
across
exercise
modalities
strongly
suggests that common processes underpin task
failure (Burnley & Jones, 2007; Jones et al., 2010;
Poole et al., 2016). That said, the PD relationship
is ultimately an empirical and integrated model of
performance; it does not predict or describe physio-
logical
processes
during
exercise,
nor
does
it
provide a physiological mechanism to explain task
failure during severe-intensity exercise. Indeed, the
proximal cause(s) of task failure during exercise
remains a topic of intense debate. The most recent
proposals for the cause of task failure include (1)
the attainment of a sensory tolerance limit related to
the highest tolerable level of peripheral fatigue
(Amann, 2011); (2) central regulation by a brain-
centred governor to prevent metabolic catastrophe
(Noakes & St Clair Gibson, 2004); or (3) an effort-
based decision to disengage from the task (Marcora
& Staiano, 2010). The physiological and peripheral
fatigue responses to severe-intensity exercise may
support the existence of a sensory tolerance limit,
since consistent levels of metabolic stress and periph-
eral fatigue are observed at task failure above the CP
in healthy young participants (Burnley et al., 2012;
Vanhatalo et al., 2010, Figure 2). The neural
anatomy exists to produce such a reflex spinally or
supraspinally
(Haouzi,
Chenuel,
&
Huszczuk,
2004), but whether this mechanism has a direct influ-
ence on exercise performance is debated (see Froyd,
Beltrami, Millet, & Noakes, 2016; Thomas et al.,
2016). Similarly, the idea that a central governor
regulates skeletal muscle recruitment on the attain-
ment of maximal cardiac output (thus preventing cat-
astrophic
muscular
metabolic
perturbations)
is
plausible, but the evidence collected to date does
not support it (see Ekblom, 2009 for a review). On
the other hand, that task failure is typically associated
with near-maximal perception of effort (Marcora,
Bosio, & de Morree, 2008; Marcora, Staiano, &
Manning, 2009), and perhaps a significant muscle
power reserve (Marcora & Staiano, 2010; but see
Power–duration relationship
7
 discussion below), might also support the notion that
task failure is a form of voluntary task disengagement.
It is our view that task failure during severe-inten-
sity exercise is not caused by task disengagement
(cf. Marcora et al., 2008), at least in healthy individ-
uals accustomed to high-intensity exercise. This is
because in isometric contractions (Burnley et al.,
2012)
and
cycle
ergometry
(Amann,
Romer,
Subudhi, Pegelow, & Dempsey, 2007; Bundle,
Ernst, Bellizzi, Wright, & Weyand, 2006), task
failure can occur before participants voluntarily termi-
nate exercise. This is illustrated in Figure 3, wherein
torque declines during isometric contractions, but
the
electromyogram
(EMG)
amplitude
remains
high after task failure has occurred (Burnley et al.,
2012). Exercise was only terminated when the par-
ticipants were told to stop. In addition, no decrease
in integrated EMG occurred at task failure during
cycle ergometry (Bundle et al., 2006; Chidnok,
DiMenna, Bailey et al., 2013) or dynamic knee-
extension exercise (Sundberg & Bundle, 2015),
which is not consistent with a sudden withdrawal of
effort and thus motor drive. That task failure in
cycling occurs before participants stop pedalling
(see Amann et al., 2007) clearly demonstrates that
no decision to voluntarily terminate the exercise
had occurred. Lastly, studies in which participants
attempted to sustain exercise after task failure had
occurred in the severe-intensity domain reveal that
this was only possible if the power output was
reduced (Chidnok, Fulford, Bailey et al., 2013;
Coats et al., 2003). When the power requirement
was reduced but the intensity remained severe, exer-
cise could only be tolerated for a few seconds,
whereas exercise in the heavy- or moderate-intensity
domains could usually be tolerated for more than
10 min (Chidnok, Fulford, Bailey et al., 2013;
Coats et al., 2003). Continuation of exercise in the
heavy domain was associated with a recovery of
muscle
metabolic
homeostasis,
whereas
in
the
severe domain this was not possible (Chidnok,
Fulford, Bailey et al., 2013). Thus, motivated partici-
pants could continue to exercise at a lower power
output after task failure if the experimental protocol
allowed them to; they do not disengage.
The recent observation of a substantial reserve in
muscle power (Marcora & Staiano, 2010; Morales-
Alamo et al., 2015) has been interpreted as evi-
dence that central and peripheral fatigue do not
limit exercise tolerance. However, the size and
functional significance of this reserve are disputed
(Ferguson, Wylde, Benson, Cannon, & Rossiter,
2016). We would add that such an experimental
design
commits
the
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
fallacy: measuring maximal neuromuscular output
after task failure has occurred does not allow one
to infer the cause of task failure during submaximal
exercise. That task failure can occur in the absence
of task disengagement, and at ostensibly submaxi-
mal
EMG
amplitudes
(Bundle
et
al.,
2006;
Chidnok, DiMenna, Bailey et al., 2013; Figures 2
and 3), suggests that task failure is a failure of
motor control, not motor capacity. It is, therefore,
the power-generating capacity of the recruited
motor units which determines whether a given
task can be sustained or not, not the power-gener-
ating capacity of the entire motor unit pool. As a
result, the functional significance of a ‘neuromus-
cular
reserve’
measured
after
task
failure
has
occurred is questionable.
Figure 3. Knee extensor torque (a) and vastus lateralis EMG (b)
during severe-intensity intermittent contractions (3 s contraction,
2 s rest) performed to task failure (Burnley et al., 2012).In (a),
task failure was defined as the failure to achieve a knee extensor
torque within 5 N m of the target for three consecutive contrac-
tions, with the first of these being the point of task failure. Each
minute, an MVC is performed, and the MVC achieved declines
as the contractions progress (i.e. fatigue systematically developed).
Note that the participant continues muscular contractions for
∼25 s after task failure. During this period, EMG amplitude (b)
remains as high as, or higher than, those values before task
failure occurred, indicating that task failure was not caused by a
sudden withdrawal of voluntary effort (i.e. task disengagement
did not occur).

 It is important to recognise that the PD relation-
ship exists not only for constant-power laboratory-
based exercise, but also for variable-paced, self-
paced,
and
intermittent
or
stochastic
exercise,
which more closely reflects ‘real-world’ athletic per-
formance (Black, Jones, Bailey, & Vanhatalo, 2015;
Chidnok et al., 2012; Chidnok, DiMenna, Bailey
et al., 2013; Skiba, Chidnok, Vanhatalo, & Jones,
2012). For example, if a subject chooses a pacing
strategy involving an initial and/or final power
output that is greater than the mean during a
severe-intensity exercise bout, the total work done
and the time to task failure are still accurately pre-
dicted with Equation (1). Indeed, assuming that CP
remains constant, the total work done above CP
(i.e. W ′) is not different during severe-intensity exer-
cise, and is associated with the attainment of ˙
VO2
peak at task failure, irrespective of the manner in
which the exercise is performed (all-out, self-paced,
constant-power,
or
incremental;
Chidnok,
DiMenna, Bailey et al., 2013). The existence of a
so-called end spurt during some forms of severe-
intensity exercise, therefore, is not incompatible
with task failure during such exercise being bound
to the PD relationship (cf. Noakes, 2011). Whilst
the selection of a pacing strategy of this type, based
on prior experience, is not contrary to the notion of
‘teleoanticipation’ (Ulmer, 1996), it does indicate
that the pacing strategy template is based upon inti-
mate ‘knowledge’ of the W ′ remaining which may
be linked to the metabolic perturbation and associ-
ated afferent traffic related to W ′ utilisation. Ulti-
mately, however, task failure in this domain is
associated with the complete utilisation of W ′ and
the attainment of a consistent ‘intolerable’ muscle
metabolic milieu (Chidnok, DiMenna, Bailey et al.,
2013; Chidnok, DiMenna, Fulford et al., 2013;
Chidnok, Fulford, Bailey et al., 2013; Vanhatalo
et al., 2010); the pacing strategy selected may alter
the pattern of W ′ utilisation (Chidnok, DiMenna,
Bailey et al., 2013), but it does not alter the underpin-
ning determinants of task failure (Figure 4).
Similarly, during intermittent exercise in which
severe-intensity exercise bouts might be interspersed
with recovery intervals performed below CP, the time
to task failure can be accurately predicted using
equations which account for the extent and rate of
W ′ utilisation during the periods of time spent
above and below CP (i.e. the W ′ balance; Chidnok
et al., 2012; Skiba et al., 2012) and is again associated
with the consistent attainment of critical indices of
metabolic and cardiorespiratory strain (Chidnok
et al., 2012; Chidnok, DiMenna, Fulford et al.,
2013). During longer endurance events, such as the
marathon or some cycle stage races, pacing is rarely
constant and it is likely that athletes select their
speed or power based on intuitive knowledge of
their proximity to CP (or critical speed), along with
information on the distance or time remaining. A
surge in pace by an opponent or the encountering
of an uphill section might result in athletes exceeding
their CP, experiencing the pace to have become
unsustainable (presumably linked to altered neural
or humoral stimuli) and them adjusting their pace
downward in compensation. Decisions made by ath-
letes on pacing during
competition
have been
reported to be well matched to the calculated W ′
remaining (Skiba, Clarke, Vanhatalo, & Jones, 2014).
The above discussion of the fatigue processes on
attending severe-intensity exercise indicates that
multiple mechanisms compromise neuromuscular
output, and that they likely do so in a collective
fashion. These processes can be summarised thus:
severe-intensity power demands result in the inexor-
able loss of muscle metabolic homeostasis, which
directly compromises muscle power output, necessi-
tating additional motor unit recruitment and increas-
ing
the
O2
cost
of
exercise
(the
˙
VO2
slow

the total work done above CP is not different, irrespective of the pacing strategy.

 component). Indirectly, the accumulation of metab-
olites results in inhibitory feedback and increases res-
piratory drive. The former makes it harder to
translate the descending drive into excitatory synaptic
input (to which the motoneurones are becoming
intrinsically less responsive, Johnson et al., 2004;
McNeil et al., 2011), and the latter fatigues the respir-
atory muscles, which might compromise limb blood
flow during whole-body exercise of sufficient dur-
ation (Romer & Polkey, 2008). The attainment of
˙
VO2 max means that further motor unit recruitment,
which at that point would be drawn from increasingly
fatigue-sensitive fibres, can only be supported by sub-
strate-level phosphorylation, amplifying all of the
above processes. Unfortunately, it is not possible to
measure all of these processes simultaneously in exer-
cising humans. Nevertheless, we contend that task
failure in the severe-intensity domain is likely the
result of a mismatch between the power demand of
the task and its instantaneous supply by the neuro-
muscular system. This mismatch involves multiple
interacting mechanisms, mechanisms which will
differ from those at lower intensities: as the intensity
decreases, the relative importance of central (and
perhaps psychological) factors seems to increase.
Conclusions
In this review, we have highlighted how mechanisms
of
neuromuscular
fatigue
are
intensity-domain
specific and how these mechanisms combine to influ-
ence exercise performance, either through reducing
the drive to exercise during extremely prolonged
exercise (in the moderate-intensity domain), by
drawing heavily on muscular fuel reserves (during
heavy-intensity exercise), or by the accumulation of
fatigue-inducing metabolites (severe-intensity exer-
cise). These processes each have knock-on effects
that may conspire to limit the synaptic input to the
motoneurone pool and/or disrupt the processes of
excitation–contraction coupling in the muscle. Task
failure will occur if a participant decides to terminate
exercise, or if the compensatory adjustments made by
the CNS fail to match the power demands of the task
even though the participant wishes to continue it.
Individuals
will
have
a
certain
pain
tolerance/
motivation to exercise and whether there is any
‘reserve’ may depend on this, along with factors
such as health, age, and familiarity with hard
exercise. In our view and experience, at least in
young healthy motivated people, no amount of
additional (internal or external) motivation or coer-
cion can increase exercise tolerance at task failure
during severe exercise – this particular task failure is
purely ‘physical’ and can be understood through
bioenergetic,
muscle
metabolite/substrate,
and
neuromuscular considerations. These physiological
phenomena, in turn, define the hyperbolic PD
relationship. Consequently, no sensible integrative
model of fatigue can ignore the PD relationship or
its physiological basis.
