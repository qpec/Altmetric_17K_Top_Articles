Peripheral taste receptor cells use multiple signaling pathways to
transduce taste stimuli into output signals that are sent to the
brain. Transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5), a sodium-
selective TRP channel, functions as a common downstream compo-
nent in sweet, bitter, and umami signaling pathways. In the
absence of TRPM5, mice have a reduced, but not abolished, ability
to detect stimuli, suggesting that a TRPM5-independent pathway
also contributes to these signals. Here, we identify a critical role for
the sodium-selective TRP channel TRPM4 in taste transduction.
Using live cell imaging and behavioral studies in KO mice, we show
that TRPM4 and TRPM5 are both involved in taste-evoked signaling.
Loss of either channel significantly impairs taste, and loss of both
channels completely abolishes the ability to detect bitter, sweet, or
umami stimuli. Thus, both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required for
transduction of taste stimuli.
taste transduction | TRPM4 | TRPM5
T
he detection of chemicals in potential food items relies on the
activity of taste receptor cells housed in taste buds located in
the oral cavity. Depending on the stimulus, tastants can directly
interact with ion channels to cause cell depolarization or activate
a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascade. Taste
buds are found in epithelial specializations called papillae and
are composed of different cell types that vary in their anatomical
features and in the signaling pathways that they express. Type I
taste cells have glial-like properties and act primarily as support
cells, while type II cells detect bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli
through the activation of a GPCR pathway (1, 2). This GPCR
pathway is composed of a phospholipase C (PLC) signaling
cascade that causes calcium (Ca2+) release from internal stores
and the subsequent activation of the monovalent selective tran-
sient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5) channel (3–10).
Type II cells lack conventional synaptic specializations and, in-
stead, activate TRPM5 to cause a cell depolarization (5, 7) which
stimulates Calhm1 channels and causes release of ATP as a
neurotransmitter (11, 12). Type III cells have conventional syn-
apses, express voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and syn-
aptic proteins such as SNAP-25, and detect sour stimuli (13–15).
TRPM5 is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP)
superfamily of ion channels. All TRP channels have six trans-
membrane domains, and many of these channels are involved in
sensory transduction (16). To date, only three TRP channels
[TRPM5 (7), PKD1L3/PKD2L1 (17, 18), and TRPV1t (19)]
have been identified in taste cells. Of these channels, TRPM5
has a well-defined role in the detection of bitter, sweet, and
umami stimuli and is exclusively expressed in type II taste cells.
TRPM5 is unique compared with most TRP channels because it
is voltage-sensitive, monovalent cation-selective, and activated by
elevated intracellular Ca2+ (5, 20, 21). Despite its importance in
these processes, there is evidence that bitter, sweet, and umami
stimuli are not exclusively transduced by TRPM5. While one study
using Trpm5−/− mice reported that mice lacked all behavioral and
nerve responses to bitter, sweet, and umami taste qualities (6),
other studies using TRPM5-KO mice have shown reduced, but
not abolished, bitter, sweet, and umami taste sensation (22–24).
These data suggest the presence of a TRPM5-independent mech-
anism that is required for normal taste transduction.
TRPM4 shares key properties with TRPM5: It is voltage-
sensitive, monovalent-selective, and activated by increased in-
tracellular Ca2+ (25–28). TRPM4 mRNA is present in taste cells
(29, 30), but its role in taste transduction has not been described.
In our current study, we found that TRPM4 is expressed in both
type II and III taste cells. Using live cell imaging in KO mice in
conjunction with pharmacological blockers, we determined that
both TRPM4 and TRPM5 contribute to taste-evoked signaling.
Loss of both TRPM4 and TRPM5 eliminated the taste cell’s
ability to detect bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli even though the
upstream signaling pathway remained intact. Behavioral studies
confirmed these physiological findings. Thus, the loss of either
TRPM4 or TRPM5 impaired taste transduction, while the loss of
both of these channels abolished the animal’s ability to detect
these stimuli.
Results
TRPM4 Is Expressed in Type II and Type III Taste Cells but Not in Type I
Cells. We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression
of TRPM4 and found it was widely expressed in taste cells.
Colocalization studies with cell type-specific markers in C57BL/
6 mice determined some specificity in its expression within the
different taste cell types. We found no colocalization between
TRPM4 and the type I taste cell marker nucleoside triphosphate
diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2) (Fig. 1A; n = 189 TRPM4+
cells and n = 125 NTPDase2+ cells). Using the TRPM5-GFP
Significance
It is currently thought that the transduction of bitter, sweet,
and umami stimuli in taste cells depends on G protein-coupled
receptor signaling with transient receptor potential melastatin
5 (TRPM5) acting as a common downstream component.
However, in the absence of TRPM5, mice have a reduced, but
not abolished, ability to detect these stimuli, suggesting that a
TRPM5-independent pathway also contributes to taste trans-
duction. Here, we identify a critical role for the TRPM4 channel
in the detection of these taste qualities. Deletion of either
TRPM4 or TRPM5 impairs sensitivity to bitter, sweet, and
umami stimuli, and loss of both TRPM4 and TRPM5 abolishes
taste responses to these stimuli. Our results show that both
TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required and sufficient for the trans-
duction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli.

 mice to identify type II taste cells, immunohistochemical analysis
showed a high level of colocalization between TRPM4 and
TRPM5 (Fig. 1B; n = 270 TRPM4+ cells and n = 209 TRPM5-
GFP cells). Approximately 90% of the TRPM5-GFP cells
expressed TRPM4, while 70% of the TRPM4 expression
was present in TRPM5-GFP taste cells.
Since TRPM4 was not completely colocalized with the type II
cell marker TRPM5, we evaluated its potential expression in type
III taste cells, using SNAP-25 as a marker. We found some
colocalization between TRPM4 and SNAP-25 (n = 165 TRPM4+
cells and n = 130 SNAP-25+ cells). Of the 165 TRPM4+ cells,
53 cells (32%) also expressed SNAP-25 (Fig. 1C). These data
were confirmed using PGP9.5, a protein that is expressed in
neuronal cells, including type III cells. Fifty-four of the TRPM4+
taste cells (n = 169 total) also expressed PGP9.5 (Fig. S1A; n = 97,
32%). Thus, TRPM4 is present in a subset of type III cells, in
addition to the majority of type II cells. To confirm that the GFP
expression in the TRPM5-GFP mice was not misexpressed in type
III taste cells, we did colocalization studies with the type III taste
cell markers SNAP-25 and PGP9.5. TRPM5-GFP did not coloc-
alize with either SNAP-25 (Fig. S1B; n = 153 TRPM5-GFP cells
and n = 120 SNAP-25+ cells) or PGP9.5 (Fig. S1C; n = 140
TRPM5-GFP cells and n = 69 PGP9.5+ cells).
Further control experiments were performed to confirm the
specificity of our transgenic mouse lines. Fig. S2 A and C shows
representative images from each of the KO lines. None of the
KO mice expressed the targeted protein for either single KOs
(Fig. S2 A and C) or double KOs (DKOs) (Fig. S2E). We also
confirmed that the TRPM5-GFP was specific to TRPM5-
expressing cells (Fig. S2F). To ensure that the loss of both
TRPM4 and TRPM5 did not impact the papillae structure or the
signaling pathway upstream of TRPM5, we evaluated the expression
of three upstream components of the pathway [PLCβ2, gustducin, and
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3)] in the taste cells
from TRPM4/5-DKO mice. We did not find any structural defor-
mities in the circumvallate (CV) papillae of the TRPM4/5-
DKO mice, and the taste cells still expressed PLCβ2, gustdu-
cin, and IP3R3 (Fig. S2 G–I). Thus, the upstream components
of the PLCβ signaling pathway remain intact in the TRPM4/5-
DKO mice.
To determine if there was a change in expression of the TRPM
channels in the KO mice, we evaluated TRPM4 expression in the
TRPM5-KO mice and TRPM5 expression in the TRPM4-KO
mice (Fig. S2 A–D). We quantitated the fluorescence intensity of
our immunohistochemical images using ImageJ (NIH) to iden-
tify any changes in expression. We reasoned this approach would
reveal any differences that were due to either an increased ex-
pression of the channel within the cell where it is normally
expressed or any increase in expression because a greater than
normal number of cells were now expressing the target protein.
There was no change in TRPM4 expression in the CV of
TRPM5-KO mice compared with wild-type mice (P = 1.0) (Fig.
S2B) and no change in TRPM5 expression in the CV of TRPM4-
KO mice compared with wild-type mice (P = 0.22024) (Fig.
S2D). Thus, our data are not confounded by a nonspecific up-
regulation of either TRPM4 or TRPM5 in the KO mice.
Using these transgenic mouse lines, our data found that
TRPM5 was not solely responsible for transducing bitter, sweet,
and umami stimuli. This finding is in contrast to a study by
Zhang et al. (6) that concluded TRPM5 was solely responsible
for the transduction of all these stimuli. To resolve this dis-
crepancy, we analyzed the expression levels of TRPM4 in the
Trpm5−/− mouse line, along with several of the upstream sig-
naling components. We refer to the mice from the study by
Zhang et al. (6) as Trpm5−/− and the mice used in our study as
TRPM5-KO. These mice were originally described by Damak
et al. (22). Our analysis of the Trpm5−/− mice identified some
changes in this KO mouse line that indicate it was not a neutral
mutation (Fig. S3). In the Trpm5−/− mouse, immunohisto-
chemical analyses of the CV papillae identified a complete loss
of TRPM5 (Fig. S3A) and normal PLCβ2 and gustducin ex-
pression (Fig. S3 B and C); however, the expression of IP3R3 and
TRPM4 was severely reduced in the CV papillae of these mice
(Fig. S3 D and E). Approximately 89% of IP3R3 expression was
lost, while TRPM4 expression was reduced by 87% in the
Trpm5−/− mice. Based on our data, this reduction in TRPM4
expression will have a significant impact on the ability to respond
to bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli, and the loss of both TRPM4
and TRPM5 is expected to produce mice ageusic to these stim-
uli, as shown by Zhang et al. (6). The loss of IP3R3 will also

 severely reduce taste responsiveness as previously shown (31). It
is unlikely that the Trpm5−/− mouse used by Zhang et al. (6)
would be able to respond to bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli since
the expression of all three of these proteins was compromised.
Thus, the conclusions from this earlier study that TRPM5 is
solely responsible for the transduction of all bitter, sweet, and
umami stimuli did not account for the loss of these additional
signaling proteins that occur in this strain.
Different Taste Stimuli Evoke Sodium Responses in Isolated Taste
Cells. We evaluated the contributions of TRPM4 and TRPM5
to taste-evoked signaling using live cell imaging on isolated taste
cells taken from mice lacking TRPM4, TRPM5, or both TRPM4/
5. Live cell imaging is a better approach for characterizing the
relative contribution of a channel to taste transduction as we can
measure responses from a large group of cells. This type of
dataset provides a quantitative analysis of the role of a particular
channel within the entire taste cell population. For this reason,
we chose not to use patch-clamp analysis, which is limited by the
number of cells that can feasibly be tested. Since TRPM4 and
TRPM5 are sodium (Na+)-selective, we optimized our prepara-
tion to measure changes in taste-evoked Na+ responses. To our
knowledge, Na+ imaging has not previously been used to mea-
sure evoked signals in taste receptor cells, so we used live cell
imaging with both Ca2+- and Na+-selective dyes to validate that
these Na+ signals were indeed taste-evoked responses.
Isolated taste receptor cells from C57BL/6 mice were loaded
with the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 and the Na+ dye Asante
NaTrium-2, and both the Ca2+ and Na+ responses to different
taste stimuli were measured, including bitter [10 mM denato-
nium benzoate (Den)], sweet (20 mM sucralose), and umami
[20 mM monopotassium glutamate (MPG)]. We chose these
stimuli as representatives of bitter, sweet, or umami taste qual-
ities, and we used maximal concentrations for each. We also
included saccharin in some of our analyses. Previous studies in
our laboratory determined that these concentrations of stimuli
produce a maximal Ca2+ response and that higher concentra-
tions do not increase the size of the taste-evoked response. We
chose to use maximal concentrations to increase the likelihood
that we would capture the responses from all taste cells that are
sensitive to these stimuli. It also allows us to analyze the different
responses to make comparisons. If we used less than maximal
concentrations, it is possible that we would consider a cell as
nonresponsive even though it could respond at higher stimulus
concentrations. Our analyses of the responses could also be
confounded if we were analyzing the responses at lower con-
centrations when the responses are expected to be more variable.
We found a concurrent increase in intracellular concentrations
of Ca2+ and Na+ in response to different taste stimuli (Fig. 2 A–
C). This increase in cytosolic Na+ corresponds with the well-
established increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that is routinely used to
measure evoked responses in taste receptor cells.
Taste Cells Lacking TRPM4 or TRPM5 Are Less Responsive to Different
Taste Stimuli. We then determined how the loss of either
TRPM4 or TRPM5 affected the taste-evoked Na+ responses.
Some taste cells that lacked TRPM5 could still generate a taste-
evoked Na+ response as well as a normal Ca2+ response to the
bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli tested (Fig. 2D and Fig. S4 A
and B). Similar results were obtained from the TRPM4-KO
mouse (Fig. 2E and Fig. S4 C and D). When both TRPM4 and
TRPM5 were lost, taste cells were able to produce a normal
increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in response to taste stimuli, but the
ability to produce a taste-evoked Na+ signal was lost (Fig. 2F and
Fig. S4 E and F). These data suggest that TRPM4 and TRPM5
both contribute to taste-evoked Na+ signals in taste cells and that
these two channels are sufficient to generate these taste-evoked
Na+ signals. Control experiments demonstrate that TTX-sensitive,
voltage-gated Na+ channels are not contributing to these taste-
evoked Na+ responses (Fig. S5 A–C). Our data also found that
these taste-evoked Na+ signals are specific to Ca2+ release from
stores because Ca2+ influx through VGCCs did not affect cytosolic
Na+ levels (Fig. S5D).
Further control experiments demonstrated that the isolated
taste cells from the TRPM5-KO, TRPM4-KO, and TRPM4/5-
DKO animals could still generate Ca2+ responses to sour and salty
stimuli, while no Na+ signals were produced (Fig. S5 E–L). These
sour and salty responses were recorded in taste cells that also
responded to high K, which indicates the presence of VGCCs and
identifies them as type III taste cells (15, 32, 33). Thus, the loss of
either TRPM4 or TRPM5 did not prevent taste cells from
responding to sour or salty stimuli. Since we did not identify any
other channels contributing to these taste-evoked Na+ responses,
and in an effort to avoid confusion, we will refer to Na+ signals
from TRPM4-KO mice as TRPM5-only, while the Na+ signals
from TRPM5-KO mice will be called TRPM4-only.
We next analyzed the taste-evoked Na+ responses in wild-type,
TRPM5-only (TRPM4-KO), TRPM4-only (TRPM5-KO), and
TRPM4/5-DKO mice to determine the overall responsiveness of
the cells to the different stimuli and to evaluate the character-
istics of the remaining taste-evoked Na+ responses. Experiments
on isolated taste cells from both CV and fungiform (Fun) pa-
pillae found that the number of bitter responsive taste cells was
significantly reduced in either the TRPM5-only or TRPM4-only
cells from both papillae compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2 G
and H). The overall responsiveness to Den and sucralose was
significantly reduced in both CV and Fun taste cells from each of
the KO mice, while saccharin responses were significantly re-
duced in both KO mouse lines for CV taste cells and TRPM4-
only Fun cells. Saccharin responses were reduced in the Fun
TRPM5-only taste cells, but were not significantly different (P =
0.3). While there were fewer MPG-sensitive taste cells in both
TRPM5-only and TRPM4-only mice compared with controls,
these values were not significantly different (Fig. 2 G and H).
Taste cells from the TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice did not re-
spond to any taste stimulus tested (Fig. 2 G and H).
We characterized the remaining taste-evoked Na+ signals
from the TRPM5-only and TRPM4-only mice and found that
these responses had significantly reduced amplitudes (percent
rise over baseline) for all of the taste stimuli tested compared
with wild-type mice, in both the CV (Fig. 3 A–D) and the Fun
taste cells (Fig. 3 E–H). We also evaluated the integrated area of
the response to get a proportional measure of the taste-evoked
Na+ signal when either TRPM4 or TRPM5 was absent. Com-
pared with the responses from the wild-type mice, the overall size
of the response was significantly reduced when either TRPM4 or
TRPM5 was missing for both CV (Fig. 4 A–D) and Fun (Fig. 4
E–H) taste cells. Therefore, the loss of either TRPM4 or
TRPM5 significantly reduces the ability of taste cells to respond
to taste stimuli in comparable ways.
Taste-Evoked Na+ Signals Are Downstream of PLCβ Signal and
Require Ca2+ Release from Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ Stores.
Since the TRPM5-only, TRPM4-only, and TRPM4/5-DKO cells
retained an intact Ca2+ response, we hypothesized that the taste-
evoked Na+ signals are downstream of the PLCβ signaling path-
way that transduces bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli (6). To test
this hypothesis, we applied the irreversible PLC inhibitor U73122
and measured the effect of blocking PLC activity on the taste-evoked
Na+ signals. We found that the bitter-, sweet-, and umami-evoked
Na+ signals were all abolished by U73122 (Fig. 5 A–D). The inactive
analog of U73122, U73433, did not affect the taste-evoked Na+
responses (Fig. 5 E–H). Further, thapsigargin, which inhibits the
sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump and
prevents the refilling of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, also
eliminated the bitter, sweet, and umami taste-evoked Na+ signals

 (Fig. 5 I–L). Based on these data, we conclude that the taste-
evoked Na+ signals are downstream of the PLCβ signaling path-
way and depend on Ca2+ release from internal stores.
Taste-Evoked Na+ Signals Are Solely Mediated by TRPM4 and TRPM5.
Our imaging experiments using the TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice
indicate that these two channels are solely responsible for gen-
erating the taste-evoked Na+ signals. To ensure this was the case,
we used specific TRPM4 and TRPM5 inhibitors and the TRPM5-
only (TRPM4-KO) and TRPM4-only (TRPM5-KO) mice to
evaluate the taste-evoked Na+ signals. The TRPM4 inhibitor
9-phenanthrol is a reversible, selective blocker of the TRPM4 channel
(34–36). When we applied 9-phenanthrol (50 μM) to taste cells from
the TRPM4-only mice, the bitter, sweet, and umami taste-evoked Na+
responses were abolished, indicating that the remaining taste-
evoked Na+ signal are due to TRPM4 (Fig. 6 A–F). After
washout of 9-phenanthrol, the taste-evoked Na+ signals were
restored. Triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) is a reversible,
selective blocker for the TRPM5 channel (37). Application of
TPPO (50 μM) eliminated the remaining taste-evoked Na+
responses in TRPM5-only mice, indicating that these taste-
evoked Na+ signals are solely mediated by TRPM5. Re-
sponses were restored after washout of TPPO (Fig. 6 G–L). To
test the specificity of our pharmacological blockers, we ap-
plied the TRPM5 blocker TPPO in the TRPM4-only mice
(Fig. S6 A–C) and the TRPM4 blocker 9-phenanthrol in the
TRPM5-only mice (Fig. S6 D–F). These antagonists had no
effect on the taste-evoked signals in these experiments. Based
on these data and our data from the TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO
mice (Fig. 2), we conclude that both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are
responsible for the taste-evoked Na+ signals and that no other
channel contributes to these responses.
TRPM4 and TRPM5 Have Different Sensitivities in Taste Cells. Analysis
of the peak rise time in wild-type, TRPM5-only, and TRPM4-
only taste cells revealed significant differences in the activation

 of the TRPM4 and TRPM5 channels during taste-evoked sig-
naling (Fig. 7 A–C). We used maximal stimulus concentrations
for these analyses to reduce any variability in the responses. Our
data were initially analyzed separately for the CV and Fun taste
cells, but no differences were found between these groups and
the data were combined. When TRPM5 was the only functional
channel present, the rise time was significantly faster for all of
the stimuli tested compared with either the wild-type or TRPM4-
only responses (Fig. 7 A–C). The rise time for TRPM4 channels
was comparable to the rise time from wild-type cells for both
Den and MPG (Fig. 7 A and C), while it was significantly slower
than the rise time from wild-type cells for sucralose (Fig. 7B).
We also evaluated the responsiveness of each TRPM channel
to a range of stimulus concentrations (Fig. 7 D–F and Fig. S7).
At lower stimulus concentrations, the taste cells had smaller
responses that increased in size with increasing stimulus con-
centration. Taste cells from the wild-type mice were the most
sensitive and responded to the lowest concentrations of stimuli
presented. Taste cells from the TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice did
not respond to any stimulus concentration presented (Fig. 7 D–F
and Fig. S7 J–L). The TRPM5 channel was also activated at
lower stimulus concentrations compared with TRPM4, although
not always comparably to wild type. Wild-type taste cells had a
measurable response to 1 mM Den, while the taste cells that only
expressed TRPM5 or TRPM4 did not respond until the con-
centration was 2.5 mM (Fig. 7D, Inset). TRPM4-dependent sig-
nals were not robust until the Den concentration was 5 mM.
There was a similar response profile for sucralose responses (Fig.
7E, Inset). For MPG, the wild-type cells had a small response to
1 mM, while the TRPM5-only cells did not respond until 5 mM
MPG was applied. Interestingly, this response was comparable to
the wild-type response (Fig. 7F, Inset); however, the responses in
the TRPM5-only taste cells were significantly smaller than wild-
type responses at higher concentrations. TRPM4-only taste cells
required 10 mM MPG to generate a measurable response.
Clearly, TRPM4 and TRPM5 have different sensitivities to
concentrations of different stimuli, but neither can solely medi-
ate the wild-type response.
Loss of TRPM4 and TRPM5 Impairs Behavioral Preference for Bitter,
Sweet, and Umami Tastants. We performed behavioral experi-
ments to determine if the loss of taste-evoked Na+ signals cor-
related with loss of taste sensitivity. We used two-bottle
preference tests to analyze the preference ratios for TRPM5-only,
TRPM4-only, and TRPM4/5-DKO mice compared with wild-type
mice. We tested two bitter, two sweet, and two umami stimuli (Fig.
8 A–C and Fig. S8) and found that loss of either TRPM4 or
TRPM5 significantly changed the preference ratios for all of the
tested taste stimuli. The TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice did not
show any concentration-dependent changes in preference; in ef-
fect, they did not treat any of the taste stimuli presented as dif-
ferent from water. TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice did prefer the
highest concentrations of sucrose (Fig. S8B; 300 and 500 mM).
Since these were long-term exposures to the stimuli (48 h) and
sucrose has well-established postingestive effects (38), we
concluded that their increased intake at these concentra-
tions is most likely due to the positive postingestive effects
associated with sucrose and not due to their ability to taste
this stimulus.
The behavioral responses of mice in the two-bottle preference
test depend on peripheral nerve input, postingestive factors,
hedonics, and central integration. To ensure that these behav-
ioral effects were not a result of some nonspecific effect due to
using long-term behavioral assays, brief-access lick assays were
also performed. The wild-type mice showed decreased licking of
quinine at a concentration of 0.01 mM and higher, while
TRPM4/5-DKO mice maintained a lick ratio close to 1.0 for all
quinine concentrations (i.e., they did not treat any concentration

KO) and TRPM5-only (TRPM4-KO) mice showed intermediate
licking behavior (Fig. 8D). Because SC45647 is hedonically posi-
tive under wild-type conditions, the lick score is calculated as licks
to the stimulus minus licks to water; therefore, a score close to
zero resembles water. In this case, the TRPM5-only, TRPM4-
only, and TRPM4/5-DKO mice showed no concentration-
dependent effect on licking to SC45647 across the entire range
of concentrations tested, but remained close to zero. In contrast,
the wild-type mice showed strong concentration-dependent in-
creases in licking to SC45647 concentrations (Fig. 8E). In the
umami brief-access test, the wild-type mice showed increases in
unconditioned licking for MSG up to 400 mM and then decreased
licking at the highest concentration (800 mM). The TRPM4-only

 and TRPM5-only mice had fewer licks compared with the wild-
type mice, and the TRPM4/5-DKO mice showed no dose-
dependent change in licking behavior but, instead, maintained
a lick ratio close to 1.0, suggesting the DKO mice treat the
stimulus as similar to water. These data clearly show that both
TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required for normal taste perception of
bitter, sweet, and umami taste qualities.
Discussion
Bitter, sweet, and umami taste qualities are detected by taste
receptor cells that share a common signaling pathway in which
the TRPM5 channel is a critical component (6, 7, 22). Only one
of these studies (6) reported that mice with a partial deletion of
TRPM5 lost all behavioral and nerve responses to bitter, sweet,
and umami compounds, while other studies reported reduced,
but not abolished, responses to bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli
when TRPM5 is lost (22–24). Our analysis of the Trpm5−/−
mouse used in the study by Zhang et al. (6) suggests that the
TRPM5 mutation in this line is not a neutral mutation. In this
mouse line, the construct retained the gene’s upstream promoter
along with exons 1–14 (6). Our immunohistochemical analysis of
this mouse line (Fig. S3) shows loss of TRPM5 with normal
PLCβ2 and gustducin expression. However, we also found re-
duced IP3R3 and TRPM4 expression. The loss of these proteins,
in addition to the loss of TRPM5, would explain why the mice in
the study by Zhang et al. (6) were not able to detect any bitter,
sweet, and umami stimuli. Studies using a different TRPM5-KO
mouse line, which was constructed by removing the promoter
and exons 1–4 of the TRPM5 gene, including the translation
start site, reported that loss of TRPM5 caused a significant im-
pairment in the transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli
but that these TRPM5-KO mice retained some sensitivity to
these taste qualities (22, 23). This mouse line was the one we
used in our studies, and our control experiments reveal no
change in the upstream components (gustducin, PLCβ2, or
IP3R3) when TRPM4 and TRPM5 are lost. We also found no
change in the expression of TRPM4 when TRPM5 is lost or in
TRPM5 expression when TRPM4 is lost (Fig. S2). These earlier
studies indicate the presence of a TRPM5-independent pathway
that is also required for normal transduction of bitter, sweet, and
umami stimuli.
Until now, the identity of this TRPM5-independent compo-
nent in taste-evoked signaling has remained elusive. Earlier re-
ports identified a Ca2+-activated cation current in taste receptor
cells that the authors speculated, but did not conclude, may be
carried through the TRPM4 channel (39, 40). A separate study
reported that TRPM4 mRNA is present in taste cells (29), while
RNA sequencing analysis revealed high levels of mRNA for both
TRPM4 and TRPM5 in isolated taste cells (30) (Fig. S2J). Our
data have clearly identified that TRPM4 has an important role in
the transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli and that
both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required for normal signaling in
taste cells.
The primary difference between TRPM4 and TRPM5 in other
cell types is their sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+. Analyses in
HEK-293 cells found that the Ca2+ concentration for half-
maximal current activation (EC50) for TRPM4 (20.2 ± 4.0 μM)
is much larger than the EC50 of TRPM5 (0.70 ± 0.1 μM) (41). If
these EC50 values are comparable in taste cells, then we predict
that during cell stimulation, TRPM5 would be activated first
when cytosolic Ca2+ levels are lower. As Ca2+ concentrations
increase, TRPM4 would also contribute to the taste-evoked
signal. While we do not know the EC50 values for TRPM4 or
TRPM5 in taste cells, our data suggest that these channels do
have different Ca2+ sensitivities. We evaluated the taste-evoked
responses when either TRPM4 or TRPM5 was absent and found
that TRPM5 channels responded to lower stimulus concentra-
tions compared with TRPM4 channels. These findings suggest
that TRPM5 requires a smaller increase in cytosolic Ca2+ for
activation compared with TRPM4.
Our rise time analyses also demonstrate that TRPM5 channels
open significantly faster than TRPM4 channels for all of the
taste-evoked responses tested, further supporting the idea that
these channels have different Ca2+ sensitivities for activation. If
TRPM4 requires more cytosolic Ca2+ for activation, then the rise
time for this channel will be slower since the channel will not be
opening very efficiently until Ca2+ levels are sufficiently higher. The
rise times of the responses when both channels were contributing

 to the signal (wild-type cells) were between the rise times for the
TRPM4-only and TRPM5-only responses. When both of these
channels contribute to the taste-evoked Na+ influx, the cell de-
polarization will be larger. Perhaps a larger depolarization is
needed to sufficiently activate the voltage-dependent ATP re-
lease from the Calhm1 channel. It has been postulated that
TRPM5 activity alone is unlikely sufficient to activate ATP re-
lease consistently enough to mediate rapid taste responses (42).
The contribution of TRPM4 will increase this initial de-
polarization, and it appears that both channels are needed to
depolarize the taste cells sufficiently to reliably activate ATP
release in response to taste stimuli.
Approximately 90% of TRPM5+ cells also express TRPM4, so
it is feasible that these channels are working together in taste
signaling. At higher stimulus concentrations, both TRPM4-only
and TRPM5-only responses are required to generate the wild-
type response. At the lower stimulus concentrations, both
TRPM4-only and TRPM5-only cells were not responsive, even
though the wild-type cells responded (Fig. 7 D–F, Insets). Analyses
of the overall size of the taste-evoked responses revealed that the
size of the Na+ response when only one channel was present was
significantly reduced for all taste stimuli tested (Fig. 4). While
significantly smaller, the taste-evoked signals in either TRPM5-
only or TRPM4-only taste cells were not half the size of the wild-
type response. If the channels were independently contributing to
the wild-type response, we would predict that adding the re-
sponses together would approximate the size of the wild-type re-
sponse. However, if we added the actual individual responses
together, they would be larger than the wild-type response. Taken
together, these data suggest there is a functional coupling of
TRPM4 and TRPM5 that is needed to generate the appropriate
cellular response. However, if this functional coupling exists, it is
not required for the channels to function, as they were able to
independently respond to higher stimulus concentrations. Perhaps
there is some coupling of TRPM4 and TRPM5 that conveys a
greater sensitivity to Ca2+ changes. TRP channels have been
shown to functionally couple in other systems (43–45), so it is
possible that this is also occurring in taste cells.
Our data demonstrate that the taste-evoked Na+ responses are
solely mediated by TRPM4 and TRPM5 channels and require
Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through activation of the
PLC signaling cascade. The activation of TRPM4 by PLC sig-
naling and Ca2+ release from stores is well established in other
systems (46, 47). While a recent study reported that the PLC
inhibitor U73122 directly activates TRPM4 (48), U73122 appli-
cation abolished taste-evoked TRPM4-dependent Na+ responses
in our study. This earlier work was done with heterologous cell
lines and a high concentration of U73122, which likely caused
nonspecific effects. We also found that the Na+ responses in
taste cells were not activated by a high K+-dependent Ca2+ influx

TRPM4 and TRPM5 have different sensitivities in taste cells. The rise times of the responses were compared by one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni’s
post hoc analysis and Student’s t test between wild-type and KO mice to determine any differences in the time to peak response when either TRPM4 or
TRPM5 was the only channel present. The rise times for TRPM5-only to Den (A), sucralose (B), and MPG (C) were significantly faster than the rise times for
either wild-type or TRPM4-only. TRPM4 was not different from wild-type for Den or MPG (A and C), but was significantly slower than wild-type for sucralose
(B). The rise time analysis for Den, sucralose, and MPG is based on n = 12 cells for wild-type, TRPM5-only, and TRPM4-only mice. A concentration gradient
analysis of a bitter stimulus (D; Den), a sweet stimulus (E; sucralose), and an umami stimulus (F; MPG) revealed reduced amplitudes for TRPM4-only and
TRPM5-only mice compared with wild-type mice at all concentrations (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). N.S., not significant. Graphs plot the average ± SE of the
responses from five cells taken from at least three mice. These experiments (raw data are shown in Fig. S7) identified different responsive ranges for
TRPM4 and TRPM5. Amplitudes were compared by one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis and Student’s t test between wild-type, TRPM4-
only, and TRPM5-only mice. (D–F, Insets) Average ± SE of the responses for wild-type (black), TRPM5-only (green), TRPM4-only (red), and TRPM4/5-DKO (blue)

 (Fig. S5D). Our data are consistent with the previous findings
that TRPM4 is activated by oscillatory changes in intracellular
Ca2+, but not by a large influx of Ca2+ (28).
Finally, our behavior experiments clearly show that both
TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required for normal responses to bitter,
sweet, and umami stimuli. In both two-bottle preference tests
and brief-access lick tests, TRPM4-only and TRPM5-only mice
had impaired behavioral responses compared with wild-type
mice. TRPM4/5-DKO mice did not demonstrate behavioral re-
sponses to any taste stimuli tested, suggesting that the loss of
both TRPM4 and TRPM5 abolished their ability to detect the
bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli that we tested. Taken with the live
cell imaging data, we conclude that both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are
required, and sufficient, for the normal transduction of bitter,
sweet, and umami taste stimuli.
Materials and Methods
Mice. Animals were cared for in compliance with the University at Buffalo
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. We used the following
transgenic mice for the experiments: TRPM5-GFP (49), TRPM4-KO (50),
TRPM5-KO (22), and TRPM4/5-DKO mice, which are all in the C57BL/6 back-
ground. All transgenic mice were generously provided by Robert Margolskee,
Monell Chemical Senses Center, Philadelphia. All mice used in the experi-
ments were between 2 and 6 mo of age, and both sexes were used for
imaging experiments and immunohistochemical analyses. Animals were
kept on a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle. No more than three mice were kept
per cage. Mice were only used for a single experiment and were not sub-
jected to any prior analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. Mice were transcardially perfused, and tongues were
collected. Forty-micrometer sections of the CV papillae were cut and then
subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. Further details are provided in
SI Materials and Methods. Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510
Meta NLO Confocal Microscope and were only adjusted for brightness
and contrast.
The following primary antibodies were used with their research resource
identifier (RRID) provided: anti–SNAP-25 (1:250, catalog no. 20-783-70323;
GenWay Biotech, Inc.; RRID: AB-1024914), anti-TRPM4 (1:50, catalog no.
OST00027W; Invitrogen; RRID: AB-1091055), anti-TRPM4 (1:50, catalog
no. ab63080; Abcam; RRID: AB-956418), anti-PGP9.5 (1:100, catalog no.
ab108986; Abcam; RRID: AB-10891773), anti-NTPDase2 [1:100 (51); RRID: AB-
2314986], anti-PLCβ2 (1:250, catalog no. SC-206; Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
RRID: AB-632197), anti-gustducin (1:100, catalog no. SC-395; Santa Cruz Bio-
technology; RRID: AB-10177605), anti-IP3R3 (1:50, catalog no. 610313; BD Bio-
sciences; RRID: AB-397705), and anti-TRPM5 [1:200 (40)]. Secondary antibodies
were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch and used at a dilution of 1:250.
ImageJ (NIH) was used to measure the corrected immunofluorescence
intensity of TRPM4 and TRPM5 in Fig. S2 and the corrected fluorescence
intensity of TRPM5, gustducin, PLCβ2, IP3R3, and TRPM4 in Fig. S3. The area,
mean gray value, and immunofluorescence intensity were measured in the
area of interest and in five small areas selected as the background signal.
The corrected integrated density was calculated as follows:
Immunofluorescence intensity = Integrated Immunofluorescence intensity
− ðArea selected × Mean value of 
backgroundÞ.
The two-tailed Student’s t test was done to determine the statistical dif-
ference between the immunofluorescence intensity of different mouse lines.
Live Cell Imaging.
Na+ imaging. All measurements of intracellular Na+ were performed in iso-
lated taste receptor cells. Taste cells were isolated and then loaded for
20 min with the Na+ indicator dye Asante NaTrium-2 (TEFLabs, Inc.) con-
taining the nonionic dispersing agent Pluronic F-127 (Invitrogen, Thermo-
Fisher Scientific). Loaded taste cells were visualized using an Olympus
IX73 microscope with a 40× oil immersion lens, and images were captured
using a Hamamatsu ORCA-03G camera. Cells were excited at 488 nm, and
images were captured at 540 nm. During experiments, the cells were kept
under constant perfusion and images were collected every 1 s using Imaging
Workbench (Indec Biosystems). Experiments were graphed and analyzed
using Origin 2016 software. Further details are provided in SI Materials
and Methods.
Peak responses and response magnitudes were averaged and plotted with
SEMs. Rise times to the peak responses were also averaged and plotted with
SEMs. Data were analyzed for statistically significant differences using either
a two-sided Student’s t test or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
a Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis as appropriate. Taste cell responsiveness was
compared using a χ2 analysis to determine if there were any significant
differences between wild-type, TRPM4-KO, TRPM5-KO, and TRPM4/5-DKO
mice. For all analyses, a significance level of P < 0.05 was used and SEMs
were reported. In all figures, statistical significance is labeled as follows: *P <
0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001. Sample numbers varied between ex-
periments due to the variability in the responsiveness of the cells to partic-
ular stimuli. Before analysis, data were evaluated for normal distribution
using the Shapiro–Wilk test and were determined to be normally distributed
at P < 0.05.
Dual Ca2+ and Na+ imaging. Cells were collected according to the procedures
described above and were loaded simultaneously with Fura 2-AM (Invitrogen)
and Asante NaTrium-2. The cells were excited at 340-, 380-, and 488-nm
excitation wavelengths. The dual Ca2+ and Na+ images were captured every
4 s using a multiedge dichroic beam-splitter that captures emission at both
510 and 540 nm and Imaging Workbench (Indec Biosystems). Experiments
were graphed and analyzed using Origin 2016 software.

Loss of TRPM4 or TRPM5 affects behavioral
responses to taste stimuli. Mean preference ratios
(±SD) from two-bottle preference tests compare the
responses of TRPM5-only (green line), TRPM4-only
(red line), and TRPM4/5-DKO (blue line) mice with
the responses of wild-type mice (C57BL/6, black line)
for the bitter stimulus quinine hydrochloride (A), the
sweet stimulus SC45647 (B), and the umami stimulus
MPG (C) (n = 5 mice of each genotype for all ex-
periments). (D) Lick scores (stimulus/water) of the
wild-type mice for the bitter stimulus quinine hy-
drochloride were significantly different from those
of TRPM4/5-DKO, TRPM5-only, and TRPM4-only
mice. (E) Lick scores (stimulus–water) of the wild-
type mice for the sweet stimulus SC45647 were
significantly different from those of TRPM4/5-DKO,
TRPM5-only, and TRPM4-only mice. (F) Lick scores
(stimulus/water) of the wild-type mice for umami
stimulus monosodium glutamate (MSG) + 10 μM
amiloride were significantly different from those of
the TRPM4/5-DKO, TRPM5-only, and TRPM4-only mice
(*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).

 Behavioral Experiments.
Two-bottle preference test. Mice from C57BL/6 (wild-type), TRPM5-only, TRPM4-
only, and TRPM4/5-DKO lines were subjected to two-bottle preference tests in
blind conditions in which each mouse tested was not identified by genotype
during the analysis. Each test concentration was presented simultaneously
with water for a total of 48 h. Test solutions were switched with water every
24 h to control for side preferences. Preference ratios were calculated as
volume of taste solution intake/total volume intake (taste solution + water).
Five male mice from each background were used, for a total of 20 mice. Two
taste stimuli for each taste quality were tested: sweet [sucrose (10, 50, 100,
300, and 500 mM) and SC45647 (0.001, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mM)], bitter [Den
(0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) and quinine hydrochloride (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1,
and 5 mM)], and umami [MPG (1, 10, 50, 100, and 300 mM) and inosine
monophosphate (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 50 mM)]. Preference ratios between
different groups of mice were compared using repeated-measures two-way
ANOVA, with a Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis and two-sided Student’s t test
used to determine significant differences for each concentration. Average
values were plotted with the SD for each stimulus concentration. The sig-
nificance level was set at P < 0.05.
Analysis of licking behavior. We recorded the unconditioned licking responses
to varying concentrations of taste stimuli in a test chamber designed to
measure brief-access licking (Davis MS80 Rig; Dilog Instruments and Systems).
Each individual lick was detected by a contact lickometer and recorded on a
computer via DavisPro collection software (Dilog Instruments and Systems).
Mice were tested on varying concentrations of SC45647, quinine hydro-
chloride, and MSG in 10 μM amiloride, in that order. Animals were water-
deprived for 22 h for all testing except SC45647, for which water-replete
animals were tested. Once an animal began licking the tube, it was allowed
10 s of access before the shutter closed. Further details are provided in SI
Materials and Methods. Lick scores and licks relative to water are compared
by repeated-measures ANOVA, with genotype as a between-factor variable
and concentration as a repeated-measures within-factor variable. Significant
interaction terms were followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference
tests. Statistical analyses were performed in Statistica.
