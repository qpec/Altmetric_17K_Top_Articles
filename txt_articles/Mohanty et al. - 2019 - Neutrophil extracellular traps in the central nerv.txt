Neutrophils are crucial mediators of host defense that are recruited to the central nervous
system (CNS) in large numbers during acute bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus
pneumoniae. Neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during infections to
trap and kill bacteria. Intact NETs are fibrous structures composed of decondensed DNA and
neutrophil-derived antimicrobial proteins. Here we show NETs in the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) of patients with pneumococcal meningitis, and their absence in other forms of
meningitis with neutrophil influx into the CSF caused by viruses, Borrelia and subarachnoid
hemorrhage. In a rat model of meningitis, a clinical strain of pneumococci induced NET
formation in the CSF. Disrupting NETs using DNase I significantly reduces bacterial load,
demonstrating that NETs contribute to pneumococcal meningitis pathogenesis in vivo. We
conclude that NETs in the CNS reduce bacterial clearance and degrading NETs using DNase I
may have significant therapeutic implications.

 A
cute bacterial meningitis (ABM) caused by Streptococcus
pneumoniae (pneumococci) is a life-threatening medical
condition that is accompanied by a high risk of debili-
tating neurological sequelae in survivors1–3. Pneumococci are not
only one of the most frequent but are also one of the most lethal
pathogens to cause ABM in both adults and children. Despite the
introduction of antibiotics and vaccines, the mortality rates
associated with pneumococcal ABM remains high4,5. The emer-
gence of antibiotic-resistant strains and nonvaccine serotypes of
pneumococci have further complicated therapy6.
The onset of bacterial infection results in the activation of both
noncellular and cellular components of the immune system, with
neutrophils among the first immune cells that are actively
recruited to sites of infections7. The central nervous system (CNS)
lacks extensive neutrophil immune-surveillance during healthy
conditions, while during ABM a massive neutrophil recruitment
occurs across the blood brain barrier (BBB) to eliminate bacteria8.
In fact, the usually clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) takes on a
turbid cloudy appearance due to the overwhelming presence of
neutrophils and bacteria during pneumococcal ABM9.
The primary function of the neutrophils is to rapidly engage
and clear invading pathogens. Neutrophils execute their function
by phagocytosis, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS),
hypochlorite
and
releasing
antimicrobial
protein/peptides
through degranulation7. In addition, neutrophils have been
described to resist invading bacteria by secreting decondensed
nuclear DNA coated with granule-derived antimicrobial proteins
called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) into the external
environment10. NET formation is an evolutionarily conserved
innate immune response that is directed at capturing and killing
microbial pathogens11. The neutrophil-derived cationic proteins
and proteases that coat NETs exhibit potent antimicrobial activity
against a wide variety of microbial pathogens12. Recently, it was
also reported that short DNA fragments derived from the DNA-
backbone of NETs can also exert bactericidal effects against
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus13. The role of
NETs as an antibacterial strategy is only beginning to unravel and
may be dependent on the type and site of infection14–17.
In spite of their antimicrobial properties, the excessive presence
of NETs can be detrimental to the host in some cases, and hence
NETs have been aptly acknowledged as “double-edged swords of
innate immunity”18. NET-components such as extracellular DNA
and antimicrobial proteins, including histones and neutrophil
elastase (NE)10, are proinflammatory and contribute to disease
severity19,20. Since NETs were discovered to have antimicrobial
effects over a decade ago, several reports have demonstrated the
prevalence of NET evasion mechanisms in bacteria, including
pneumococci21. The pneumococci can evade NET-mediated
killing by degrading NET-DNA secreting nucleases22,23, or by
incorporating positively charged
D-alanine into surface lipo-
teichoic acids, enabling the bacteria to repel cationic anti-
microbial peptides bound to NETs24. These mechanisms allow
pneumococci to remain trapped within NETs without being killed
and aid in their dissemination from the lungs into the blood
stream21.
To date, the presence of NETs has been demonstrated in the
CSF in a single study by using a porcine model of Streptococcus
suis meningitis25. However, the presence of NETs in human CSF
has never been established. We undertook the study to investigate
whether NETs are formed in CSF during pneumococcal infec-
tions and, if present, to characterize their functional importance
in ABM. Here, we demonstrate the presence of NETs and NET-
related proteins in the CSF of pneumococcal ABM patients using
immunofluorescence microscopy and mass spectrometry. A rat
model of pneumococcal meningitis further revealed neutrophil
recruitment and NET formation in the CSF. The presence of
NETs in the CSF compartment was found to promote pneumo-
coccal survival and dissemination into other organs. Degradation
of NET-associated DNA using DNase I resulted in the clearance
of bacteria from the brain, lungs, spleen and blood of infected
animals. This was because DNase treatment increased oxidative
burst and phagocytosis in neutrophils coincubated with pneu-
mococci. Our data indicate that NET formation in the CSF during
pneumococcal meningitis might be detrimental to the host and
that degrading these structures using DNase I leads to enhanced
bacterial clearance from the brain.
Results
NETs are present in human CSF during pneumococcal
meningitis. Apart from bacteria, NETs have been reported to be
released in response to viruses26 and Borrelia27. The presence of
neutrophils and cytokines can also cause damage to the CNS
during sterile inflammation in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SH)
28,29 These findings prompted us to investigate if NETs were
present in human CSF during various infections and sterile
noninfectious inflammation of the CNS. To examine the presence
of NETs in CSF, cytospins from individuals afflicted with pneu-
mococcal ABM, viral meningitis (VM), neuroborreliosis (NB) or
SH were analyzed using immunofluorescence. The clinical para-
meters describing the patients are detailed in Supplementary
Table 1a. Patients with ABM displayed distinctly higher neu-
trophil counts and protein content in the CSF compared to other
disease groups. Areas of decondensed extracellular thread-like
DNA or large DNA aggregates colocalizing with neutrophil-
granule-derived NE, characteristic of NETs30,31, were detected by
immunofluorescence exclusively in CSF from ABM patients but
not in patients with VM, NB, and SH (Fig. 1a, c). Nonaggregated
NETs and diffuse NETs32 with decondensed nuclei were also
detected in ABM CSF at a higher magnification (Fig. 1b). Further,
ex vivo treatment of CSF from ABM patients with previously
validated NET-disruptive agents such as DNase I or heparin33
resulted in degradation of the NE-DNA complexes, confirming
that these were NETs indeed (Fig. 2).
The extracellular release of NET-bound proteins such as
heparin-binding protein (HBP/azurocidin)34,35, myeloperoxidase
(MPO), NE36, and histones37 is tightly regulated as they can cause
severe damage to host tissues. The substantial presence of these
proteins in extracellular body fluids such as blood plasma is
usually indicative of severe disease20,38. In fact, HBP is one such
protein whose elevated levels in human plasma co-relate with
sepsis severity38,39. Increased HBP concentrations are also
observed in the CSF during ABM 40. To elucidate the presence
of other NET-related proteins in the CSF environment, shotgun
proteomic analysis was performed on the CSF of ABM, VM, NB,
and SH patients. Significantly raised levels of several NET-
associated
antimicrobial
proteins34,41
including
MPO,
NE,
proteinase-3 (PR3), LL-37, matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9),
HBP, neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), S100A8/
9 complex and histones were observed in the CSF from ABM
patients compared to CSF from other patient groups (Table 1,
Supplementary table 2).
Since NETs are known to be released in response to
bacteria12,42,
we
tested
if
pathogens
causing
community-
acquired or nosocomial ABM43 could trigger NET formation
in vitro. Purified human neutrophils were challenged with clinical
isolates of the meningeal pathogens S. pneumoniae, Neisseria
meningitides, Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Escherichia coli,
Acinetobacter
baumanii,
Streptococcus
oralis,
Staphylococcus
capitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Supplementary figure 2).
All strains except L. monocytogenes significantly induced NET
formation in vitro within an hour. This finding aligns with a

 previous report44 and is indicative that ABM-causing bacteria are
the primary NET-inducers.
NETs in the CNS promote pneumococcal survival in ABM.
Having established the presence of NETs in patients with pneu-
mococcal ABM, and pneumococci as a trigger for NET formation,
we sought to explore the function of NETs during ABM in a rat
model of pneumococcal meningitis. Four pneumococcal strains
namely, SP001, SP002, SP003, and SP004, were isolated from
patients with ABM where NET formation in the CSF was
observed. The pneumococci were serotyped and characterized
with
data-dependent
shotgun
proteomics
(Supplementary
Table 3). Upon analyzing the proteomes, all clinical strains were
found to express proteins that were highly similar to the well-
documented pneumococcal strain TIGR4, indicating that the
bacteria recovered from the ABM patients were indeed pneu-
mococci (Supplementary Figure 2). The pneumococcal isolate
SP001 (serotype 18b) induced maximal NET formation in pur-
ified human and rat neutrophils in vitro, and was therefore
chosen for subsequent in vivo experiments (Supplementary
Figs. 4, 6). Peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-mediated his-
tone citrullination facilitates chromatin decondensation and has
been identified as a key event required for releasing NETs45.
PAD4 inhibition using Cl-amidine results in the suppression of
NET formation in response to bacteria46. Cl-amidine did not
inhibit SP001-induced NET formation in purified human neu-
trophils,

 production in response to SP001 (Supplementary Figure 5).
Pneumococci are known to degrade NETs by secreting endonu-
cleases such as EndA and TatD22,23. However, no degradation of
NETs generated with SP001 was observed after 4 h of coincuba-
tion alone or in the presence of actin that is known to inhibit
DNases16 (Supplementary figure 6). This is likely explained by the
very low production of EndA and TatD in SP001 as shown in the
mass spectrometry experiments (Supplementary dataset 1).
Suspensions of pneumococci in saline or a saline vehicle
control were infused subarachnoidally in rats. Immunofluores-
cence images of brain sections revealed the presence of MPO-
positive neutrophils at the injection site and in the ventricles 24 h
after infection (Fig. 3a). NETs were detected in the brain of
infected rats in contrast to control animals that received a bolus
of saline only (Fig. 3b). NETs appeared as smaller areas of
decondensed extracellular DNA with bound MPO, and within
large aggregates, characterized by substantial presence of DNA
devoid of distinct nuclear morphology and MPO (Fig. 3b). An
increase in the astrocyte activation marker glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) staining, which is known to be upregulated in
pneumococcal meningits47 was also observed in infected rats
(Fig. 3c). Animals infected with SP001 lost more weight than
controls (Fig. 3d). Meningitis in infected animals was validated at
24h by their increased BBB permeability using radiolabeled
chromium-EDTA, higher IL-6 levels in the brain homogenates of
infected animals compared to controls (Fig. 3d) and by the
presence of viable bacteria in the whole brain homogenates of
infected animals48 (Fig. 4a). The difference in weight loss between
noninfected and infected animals was not significant as the
surgical procedure alone can cause weight loss49 that often
persists up to a week before full recovery is seen50.
Bacterial viability was determined by plating various dilutions
of whole brain homogenates from control and infected animals.
After 24 h, NETs could also be detected in the CSF of infected
animals in amounts similar to those observed in human ABM
(Fig. 4b, c). To clarify the role of NETs during ABM, DNase I
(hereafter referred to as DNase) was infused subarachnoidally in
rats either at the time of infection to prevent the accumulation of
NETs, or 10 h after infection to simulate a postinfection
treatment. No NETs were detected in the CSF of DNase-treated
animals (Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary Figure 7). Pneumococcal
viability in the brain homogenates of DNase-treated animals at
both time points was also reduced significantly, indicating that
DNase treatment had resolved the CNS infection (Fig. 4a). Since
NETs can prevent bacterial dissemination from the site of
infection16,32, bacterial load in other organs was investigated in
DNase-treated animals. Surprisingly, lung and spleen homo-
genates, and blood plasma of DNase-treated animals displayed a

Thus,
indicating that DNase treatment also had prevented bacterial
dissemination into other organs (Fig. 4a).
Given that intravenous injection is a more convenient and safer
route of administration than intrathecal injection in a clinical
setting, we also investigated effects of intravenous (i.v.) DNase
treatment in the rat model in a randomized double-blinded
manner. Intravenous DNase treatment also reduced bacterial
loads in the homogenates of brain, lungs and spleen, and blood
plasma (Fig. 4a). Intravenous DNase cleared NETs from the CSF
(Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary Figure 7), suggesting that DNase can
cross the BBB to facilitate bacterial clearance in this rat meningitis
model. The bacterial clearance was also accompanied by lowered
IL-1b levels in the brain homogenates of intrathecal and i.v.
DNase-treated rats. This is indicative of a decrease in inflamma-
tion due to reduction in the number of viable bacteria in the brain
(Supplementary Figure 8). A lower number of bacteria in the
brain of untreated rats may have resulted due to infusion of
intravenous saline and the use of heparin as an anticoagulant to
prevent obstruction of catheters by blood clotting.
DNase treatment enhances bacterial clearance. To study the
mechanisms by which DNase enhances neutrophil-mediated
bacterial killing, NETs were induced in vitro by coincubating
purified human neutrophils with pneumococci, in the presence of
DNase or saline controls. Bacterial viability was reduced in
DNase-treated samples within 30 min of stimulation, and max-
imal killing was observed after 3 h in vitro (Fig. 5a). Increased
killing by neutrophils in the presence of DNase alone was also
observed with several strains of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae
and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (Supplemental Figure 9).
Bacteria coincubated with only DNase without neutrophils did
not induce bacterial killing, suggesting that the DNase alone does
not exhibit any antibacterial activity (Supplemental figure 10).
Phagocytosis followed by MPO-dependent hypochlorite pro-
duction is a major neutrophil killing mechanism51, which may be
hindered by the inability of the NET-bound neutrophils to reach
NET-trapped bacteria. Hence, to determine the role of the
phagocytosis-oxidative burst axis, NETs in vitro were induced by
challenging isolated human neutrophils with pneumococci in the
presence of DNase alone, or in conjugation with inhibitors of
phagocytosis or oxidative burst. Inhibition of phagocytosis with
cytochalasin D, and inhibition of either one of the two major
enzymes in the oxidative burst (NADPH oxidase or MPO)52
significantly reduced bacterial killing (Fig. 5b). Compared to
saline controls, a significant increase in phagocytosis was
measured (Fig. 5c) and an increase in intracellular bacteria was
observed within the neutrophils (Fig. 5d) 30 min after DNase
treatment. MPO activity also significantly increased in the
supernatant after DNase treatment after 30 min (Fig. 5e).
Together these results suggest that removal of NETs by DNase
enhances neutrophil killing mechanisms via the phagocytosis-
oxidative burst axis.
Extracellular DNA is a highly anionic polymer that can bind
and neutralize activity of positively charged AMPs like LL-37 by
forming complexes53. Degradation of DNA by DNase results in
enhanced microbicidal activity due to an increase in freely
available AMPs and unmasking of their positive charge. To
determine the effects of DNase treatment that enhance AMP
activity, cell-free supernatants from NETs generated with PMA in
the presence or absence of DNase were collected and concen-
trated. A reduction in the viability of SP001 was observed upon
incubation with concentrates derived from DNase-treated super-
natants after 3 h in vitro (Fig. 5f). Mass spectrometry analysis
revealed an increase in concentration of known NET-bound
AMPs such as S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, lactoferrin, lysozyme,
HBP/azurocidin, MPO, NE, histone H4, PR3, cathepsin G, alpha
defensin-1 and -3
34 in DNase-treated samples (Fig. 5g).
Collectively, these results indicate that DNase degrades NETs at
the site of infection, releasing functional antimicrobial peptides
that boosts antimicrobial activity and enhancing phagocytosis-
oxidative burst axis (Fig. 6).
Discussion
During bacterial infections, NET formation in blood vessels is
initiated by whole bacteria or bacterial products. Formation of
NETs is mediated through a combination of CD11a/CD18 and
TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4 54, or CD11b/CD18 and TLR2 (toll-like
receptor 2)32 signaling axes in neutrophils. The data describing
the role of NETs in the CSF compartment during ABM are scarce.
Our findings offer several novel insights into pneumococcal
meningitis and uncovers a previously unrecognized contribution
of NETs during CNS infections by pneumococci. NETs have been
demonstrated to be beneficial in blood circulation and may have
evolved as a mode of defense to immobilize and transfer microbes
for later destruction in the reticuloendothelial system during
systemic infections55. The lymphatic system in the CNS was first
described by Foldi et al. in 1966 56. The lymphatic vessels are
present in the bed of the dura matter and drain into subarachnoid
space. Recently, a detailed description of the lymphatic vessels
lining the dura matter and immune-surveillance by T cells in
them has been published57. However, the presence of neutrophils
in lymphatic vessels of the CNS and whether these vessels carry
neutrophils into the CNS during infections remains to be seen.
Because the CNS has a poorly developed lymphatic drainage
compared to most other organs58, overt NET formation could
potentially hinder clearance of bacteria and waste products.

granules, cytosol or nucleus. Refer to Supplementary Table 2 included in the supplementary data

 Extracellular DNA can cause an increase in the viscoelasticity of
airway secretions during cystic fibrosis59. A similar presence of
extracellular DNA may also increase CSF viscosity and hinder its
circulation in the CNS. Therefore, we hypothesize that excessive
presence of NETs in the CSF compartment could be a major
disadvantage for the host in ABM. Other important future areas
of study will involve detailing the normal and pathological roles
of NETs and the extracellular presence of NET-associated
molecules such as HBP60,61 and histones37 in ABM.
Furthermore, our data demonstrate that targeting NET-
associated extracellular DNA in the CNS with DNase adminis-
tered either intrathecally or intravenously significantly increased
bacterial clearance from the entire brain in a rat model of
pneumococcal meningitis. These results align with a study from
1959 in which Tillett and coworkers suggested a 26% reduction in
mortality by using DNase as an adjunct to penicillin therapy to
treat pneumococcal meningitis62. The authors did not have the
tools to provide a mechanism of action or the source of extra-
cellular DNA at that time but postulated that degradation of
DNA somehow exposed invasive bacteria to host defenses and/or
antimicrobial therapy.
DNase treatment of neutrophils incubated with pneumococci
resulted in reduced bacterial viability in a time-dependent fash-
ion. The antibacterial effect exerted by neutrophils might be a
complex interplay between phagocytosis, cationic peptide killing,
ROS production, and NET formation. Phagocytosis is an

Fig. 4 DNase facilitates bacterial clearance in a rat model of pneumococcal meningitis. Rats received a subarachnoid infusion of either S. pneumoniae
SP001 strain (infected) or equal volume of saline solution (control). a After the rats were sacrificed, the brain, the right lung, and the spleen were collected
and homogenized immediately. The blood was collected and centrifuged to obtain plasma. Organ homogenates and blood plasma samples were spread
onto agar plates and resulting bacterial colonies were counted after 24 h. Indicated groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s
multiple comparisons test, *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001 and error bars denote standard deviations. b To determine the effect of intrathecal DNase
treatment, infected rats either received a subarachnoid infusion of 10 units of DNase simultaneously (0 h) or 10 h after the infection, or they received an
equal volume of saline vehicle solution simultaneously to the infection. To determine the effect of intravenous DNase treatment, infected rats either
received an intravenous bolus dose of 3500 units of DNase 6 h after the infection, followed by intravenous infusion of 780 units/h over the next 18 h, or
they received an equal volume of saline vehicle control in the same manner. In all cases, uninfected (control) rats received an equal volume of saline vehicle
control either intrathecally or intravenously as indicated. All rats were sacrificed 24 h after the infection. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected for visualization
of NETs only by immunofluorescence against rat myeloperoxidase (red) and DNA (blue). Areas of red and blue colocalization represent NETs. Scale bars
denote 200 µm. c NETs were quantified using Fiji and expressed as percentage of NETs, percentage of staining under NETs per field of view and total area

 important microbicidal mechanism that can also be observed in
neutrophils post-NET formation42. Similarly, deficiencies in the
NADPH oxidase and MPO are also associated with fatal infec-
tions7. Our data suggest that inhibition of phagocytosis, NADPH
and MPO led to reduced bacterial killing with DNase treatment.
Further, addition of DNase was paralleled by an increase in the
intracellular bacterial load in neutrophils and MPO activity after
30 min. These data demonstrate the importance of classical
neutrophil killing strategies such as phagocytosis and MPO
activation in bacterial clearance even after NETs are rendered
redundant by addition of DNase.
In instances where NET formation might dominate over other
killing mechanisms, pneumococci that are known to resist NET-
mediated killing24 may take advantage by hiding and replicating
within the DNA framework. Thus, the NET-associated extra-
cellular DNA that accumulates in the CNS could hinder the
antimicrobial function of intact neutrophils and promote bacterial
persistence. We have shown using in vitro studies that SP001

 remains trapped in NETs as they do not produce DNases to
degrade NETs. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
bacteria remain trapped in the NETs without any reduction in
viability. In the rat model, the bacteria escape from the brain and
disseminate to other organs by unknown mechanisms. We
hypothesize that bacteria upon encountering neutrophils induce
NET formation in the brain; however, not all bacteria are bound to
NETs. Hence, bacteria surviving within NETs or unbound bacteria
increase their viable load and cause leakage in the BBB. The
bacteria ultimately cross over the defective BBB and disseminate
into other organs. Future studies delineating the exact mechan-
isms by which pneumococci escape the brain may be particularly
important to understand pneumococcal pathogenicity.
The DNase treatment degrades extracellular NET-DNA and
may facilitate phagocytosis by unmasking bacteria trapped in
NETs, exposing them to intact neutrophils. In addition, we
demonstrate that DNase treatment releases functional AMPs and
theorize that DNase-mediated dissolution of NETs releases
antimicrobials such as short DNA fragments13,63 and NET-
bound cationic proteins that further increases bacterial killing
Fig. 5 Mechanisms of DNase-mediated enhancement of bacterial killing. a Human neutrophils were stimulated with SP001 strain ± DNase and ±plasma.
Time-dependent bacterial viability was determined (n=5). b Neutrophils were stimulated with the SP001 with/without DNase, in presence of saline,
Cytochalasin D (CytD), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (MPOI) and bacterial viability was determined. Dots represent mean
values and groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test. c Neutrophils were stimulated with the SP001 ±
DNase. Gentamicin was added and intracellular bacterial load was determined. Columns represent mean values and groups were compared by unpaired t
test, n=5. d Neutrophils were stimulated with the Oregon Green-labeled SP001 (green). NETs were visualized by immunofluorescence against DNA (blue)

Fig. 6 Model for activity of DNase in ABM. In ABM, in the absence of DNase (left panel), invasion of pneumococci into the CSF triggers neutrophil
migration into the CNS resulting in pleocytosis and massive neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. The trapped bacteria survive in the NETs
because they are shielded from neutralization by cationic antimicrobial peptides and anionic extracellular DNA and are protected from phagocytosis by
neutrophils. In the presence of DNase (right panel), the NETs are resolved due to degradation of extracellular DNA. (1) This generates antimicrobial DNA
fragments and frees antimicrobial proteins, which exert bactericidal/bacteriostatic effects, leading to increased extracellular killing of bacteria. (2) The
degradation of DNA also makes bacteria more accessible to intact neutrophils, leading to increased phagocytosis. (3) This increased contact with bacteria
leads to activation of the respiratory burst pathway within the neutrophil, generating various peroxidated products and hypochlorite (HOCl), leading to
increased intracellular killing of the bacteria

 in vivo. Thus, the overall effect of DNase may allow other neu-
trophil defense mechanisms to take over and facilitate bacterial
clearance (Fig. 6).
Both intrathecal and intravenous DNase treatment results in
the reduction of viable bacterial load across several organs, which
can be considered beneficial64,65. However, we could not detect a
significant effect on physiological parameters that indicate disease
severity. We only show a reduction in the levels of IL-1b. The
beneficial effects of DNase as an adjunct to antibiotics and/or
anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone in the treat-
ment of bacterial meningitis needs to be further evaluated using
relevant animal models. DNase is approved for the treatment of
cystic fibrosis66, suggesting that clinical use of DNase as a novel
therapeutic in ABM may be a feasible treatment option. Since
DNase alone does not directly kill bacteria, the development of
bacterial resistance to DNase treatment is less likely. In summary,
our data suggest a harmful role of NETs in pneumococcal
meningitis by inhibiting clearance, and reducing NETs using
DNase I aids bacterial clearance in pneumococcal ABM.
Methods
Patient sample collection. The study was approved by the Lund University ethics
committee (Dnr 2016/672) and consent was also obtained from patients or next of
kin. CSF was obtained from patients with S. pneumoniae meningitis (n = 6),
neuroborreliosis (n = 3), acute viral meningitis (n = 4), and subarachnoid
hemorrhage (n = 3) by lumbar puncture or through an intraventricular device, if it
was installed. CSF samples were kept at 4 °C and were processed within 0–24 h
after collection. Antibiotic treatment was initiated in patients with pneumococcal
ABM between 0 and 96 h from the time of CSF collection.
Detection of NETs. CSF samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-
Aldrich). The samples were then cytocentrifuged (Thermo Fisher) and permeabi-
lized and blocked with 5% goat serum (BioWest). ABM patients were also treated
with either heparin (Leo, 1 U/mL), or DNase (Abcam, 5 U/mL). Human samples
were stained with rabbit-anti-human neutrophil elastase (Dako, rabbit 1373 con-
tract immunization, a kind gift from Dr Ole E. Sorensen, dilution 1:500) and
detected with Alexafluor 594-labeled secondary goat-anti-rabbit Fab antibody
fragment (Life Technologies, dilution 1:1000). Rat samples were stained with anti-
mouse MPO67 (Novusbio, NBP1-51148, dilution 1:500) and detected with Alexa-
fluor 594-labeled secondary goat-anti-rabbit Fab antibody fragment (Life Tech-
nologies, dilution 1:1000). Coverslips (#1, Menzel Glaser) were mounted on top of
the samples with ProLong Gold Antifade mountant (Life Technologies) and
visualized with a Nikon Ti-E microscope. Images were acquired with the Andor
Neo/Zyla camera and NIS elements advanced research software (Nikon).
Quantification of NETs. For detection of NETs in patient CSF and animals, 5−7
random images at ×20 or ×10 magnification were used for quantifying each con-
dition. Images were thresholded using auto local threshold function and Phan-
salkar or Otsu methods in Fiji software68. NETs were defined as a localization of
DNA and neutrophil elastase and expressed as percentage of NETs, % NET
staining per field of view and area under NETs staining in square millimeters.
NET formation in vitro was quantified as described by Mohanty et al.17. Five to
seven random images at ×20 magnification containing a minimum of 175 cells
were used for quantification. The DNA channel was used in identifying nuclei, and
the elastase channel was determined using Fiji. The samples were then thresholded
in Fiji and an increase in the elastase positive area of 33% was used to determine
the NET-positive events.
Bacterial culture. Clinical isolates of various bacteria were collected from either
blood or CSF from patients after being diagnosed with meningitis at the clinic for
infectious diseases at Skåne University Hospital in Lund, Sweden. For survival
assays, animal infection and NET induction, all S. pneumoniae strains were cul-
tured overnight on blood agar and then taken into Todd−Hewitt medium with
0.5% yeast extract (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 10% choline chloride
(Sigma). Upon reaching an optical density (OD) of 0.4 they were washed and
resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (Sigma) at an appropriate
dilution for further experiments.
Rat model of meningitis. The local Ethical Committee for Animal Research (M80-
14) approved the experimental protocol48. Adult male Sprague Dawley® rats
(Taconic, 350–370 g) were used. Animals were treated in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health for the Care and Use for Laboratory Animals.
Parasagittal craniotomy was performed (5 mm) using a drill without harming the
dura. Either 20 µL of bacterial solution (3×106 bacteria), or the same bacterial
solution containing 10 units of recombinant human DNase I (Abcam), or sterile
physiological saline solution (Fresenius Kabi), was injected into the subarachnoid
space between the meninges through a polyethylene tube using a gas tight syringe.
A needle (27 G) was inserted into the subarachnoid space and approximately 10 μL
of CSF was drawn and diluted with 200 μL of physiological saline. NETs were
visualized in CSF samples as above.
Immunohistochemistry. After the animals were sacrificed, brains were quickly
dissected and drop fixed overnight in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight (o/n)
at 4 °C and washed in PBS. Brains were embedded in 1.5% agarose (A5093, Sigma-
Aldrich) diluted in PBS and vibratome sectioned (100 µm sections; Leica
VT1200S). Free floating sections were washed three times in PBS, blocked for 2 h at
room temperature (RT) in blocking solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-
Aldrich) and 5% normal donkey or goat serum (Gibco™; Thermo Fisher Scientific)
in PBS followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in
blocking solution. Primary antibodies used in this study were: chicken IgY anti-
GFAP (1:500; PA1-10004, Thermo Fisher Scientific), mouse IgG1 anti-MPO
(1:100; NBP1-51148, Novusbio) and rabbit anti-S. pneumoniae (SP; 1:100; PA1-
7259, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following day, sections were incubated with
appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores (Alexa Fluor; 1:500;
goat anti-mouse IgG1 AF568, goat anti-rabbit AF488, goat anti-rabbit AF568, goat
anti-rat IgG2a AF488, goat anti-chicken AF568, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at
RT. After PBS washes, sections were counterstained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole; 1:1000; 1 mg/mL; 62248, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min at RT.
Slices were mounted with ProLong® Gold Antifade mounting medium (P36934,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images of the immunolabeled slides were acquired using
an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Ni-E) with Plan Apo λ ×4 /0.20 objective at
constant exposure levels throughout the study. Confocal microscopy analysis was
also performed (Nikon Eclipse Ti) with Plan Fluor ×10/0.25 NA, ×20/0.75 NA,
×40/1.30 NA or ×100/1.25 NA oil objectives.
For immunohistochemistry analysis, maximum intensity projections were
analyzed in ImageJ software and Imaris software (version 9.1.2).
Mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol
(Sigma, USA) for 45 min at 37 °C, and alkylated with 25 mM iodoacetamide
(Sigma, USA) for 45 min followed by dilution with 100 mM ammonium bicarbo-
nate to a final urea concentration below 1.5 M. Proteins were digested by incu-
bation with trypsin (1/100, w/w) for 18 h at 37 °C. The peptides were cleaned up by
C18 reversed-phase spin columns as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Harvard
Apparatus, USA).
All peptide analyses were performed on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an EASY-nLC 1000 ultra-high-
performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The DDA
spectra were searched against the human reference proteome acquired from
UniProt (UP000005640, Oct-2015, reviewed and canonical proteins only) by using
Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP v4.7 POLAR VORTEX rev 0, Build 201405161127)
with X!Tandem. Computational workflows for analyzing DIA data was executed
and managed by openBIS69 and included OpenSWATH v2.070 data extraction
using an assay library of human purified neutrophils70,71 (unpublished: E.
Malmström, S. Hauri, Johan Malmström), pyprophet-cli 0.0.1971 for false
discovery rate (FDR) estimation and the FDR was set to 1% at peptide precursor
level and at 1% at protein level, and TRIC72 for reducing the identification error.
The quantitate protein matrix was filtered against NET-bound proteins34 and the
individual replicate protein intensities were normalized against respective total
protein intensity per donor. A more detailed description is described in the
supplementary methods section.
Blood−brain barrier permeability. BBB permeability was assessed by measuring
the blood to brain transfer constant (Ki) for 51Cr-EDTA as described in detail
previously73. Briefly, at about 23 h after injection of bacteria, animals were rea-
nesthetized. A bolus of approximately 50 kBq of 51Cr-EDTA (Nycomed Amer-
sham, Stockholm, Sweden) was given intravenously, followed by an infusion at a
rate of 200 kBq/h. Arterial blood samples (10 µL) were collected at every 2.5−5 min
for 40 min. At 37 min, about 70 kBq 125I-albumin was given intravenously. At 40
min the animals were decapitated. An 8-mm coronal section of the cortex centered
over the insertion point for bacteria was removed and weighed. 51Cr and 125I
activities in tissue and blood samples were determined in a gamma counter.
Arterial hematocrit was measured at the start and at the end of the tracer infusion
and was used to convert blood concentrations into plasma concentrations. Ki
was then calculated as: Ki = B/∫0T Ca (t) dt, where B is the amount of tracer
in the tissue, Ca is the concentration of the tracer in arterial plasma as a
function of time, and T is the duration of the experiment. B was calculated as the
total 51Cr activity in the tissue samples minus the 51Cr activity in the cortical
plasma volume determined by the distribution volume for 125I-albumin in the
tissue sample.

 10-h DNase treatment in rats. Recombinant human DNase I (Abcam) was
infused subarachnoidally 10 h after bacterial infection. A catheter was placed
subarachnoidally as described above and 10 units of DNase was infused at a flow
rate of 2 μL/min. The piece of bone was replaced and sealed with histoacryl and the
wound was again closed.
Intravenous DNase treatment in rats. All intravenous treatments were per-
formed in a blinded and randomized fashion. The correspondence between code
and treatment was revealed only after results were obtained. Bacteria or saline
vehicle control was infused subarachnoidally in rats as described above. For
intravenous administration, a catheter was inserted into the jugular vein. Six hours
after bacteria or vehicle infusion, a bolus dose of 3500 units of DNase (Wor-
thington) or equal volume saline vehicle solution was infused intravenously using a
syringe pump. Then a continuous infusion of 780 units/h of DNase or equal
volume saline vehicle solution at a flow rate of 0.05 mL/h was initiated.
Bacterial counts in rat organ homogenates. The brain, lungs and spleen were
homogenized using silicone beads in a TissueLyser (Qiagen) and the homogenate
was plated onto blood agar plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Colony-
forming units were counted.
IL-6 in brain homogenate. Brain homogenate was mixed with T-PER lysis buffer
(Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Protein content in the
lysate was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo
Fisher). IL-6 was measured in the lysed homogenate using a Quantikine rat IL-6
ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s directions.
Bacterial killing after DNase treatment. The leakage of plasma across BBB
further increases the plasma protein concentrations in the CSF in ABM, which can
vary between 500 and 3600 mg/dL74. Hence, 10% plasma (700 mg/dL) diluted
in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer, representing the lower limit was
chosen to mimic the protein concentration of ABM CSF. NETs were induced in
human neutrophils as above, in the presence of DNase (5 units) or equal volume of
saline solution. To determine the killing mechanism, the following inhibitors were
added 30 min after addition of DNase and bacteria: 10 µM Cytochalasin D (Cal-
biochem), 10 µM myeloperoxidase inhibitor 4-Aminobenzoic hydrazide (4-ABAH)
(Calbiochem) or 10 µM NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyl iodonium chloride
(DPI) (Calbiochem). Samples were incubated for 2.5 h after addition of inhibitors.
NETs were detected as above using immunofluorescence. Samples were then
diluted and plated on blood agar plates. Colony-forming units of S. pneumoniae
were determined.
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay. After 30 min of in vitro NET induction
in the presence and absence of DNase as described above, samples were cen-
trifuged, and the cell-free supernatant analyzed for MPO peroxidation and
chlorination activity using EnzChek MPO Assay Kit (Molecular Probes) according
to the manufacturer’s directions.
Gentamicin assay. SP001 was cultured in THY medium supplemented with
choline chloride as described above. The bacteria were then added at MOI of 10 to
1×106 neutrophils in HBSS with 10% plasma alone, or in the presence of DNase (5
U) for 15 min. Gentamicin (10 µg/mL) was added for 30 min at 37° to kill extra-
cellular bacteria. Cells were washed thrice with HBSS and lysed with sterile water.
The bacteria were then plated out at various dilutions and CFUs were counted to
assess survival.
Visualization of phagocytosis. SP001 strain was labeled with Oregon green 488-X
succinimidyl ester (20 µM, Life Technologies) in PBS for 30 min in the dark at
room temperature. The labeled bacteria were then washed thrice in PBS to remove
excess unbound dye. Bacteria were then added to neutrophils in HBSS with 10%
autologous plasma (MOI 1:10) alone or in the presence of DNase (5 U) on shaking
for 1 h at 37° in the dark. Samples were then fixed, cytocentrifuged onto slides and
processed for immunocytochemistry as described previously. Neutrophils were
probed with rabbit human anti-elastase and DNA was visualized with DAPI.
Antibacterial assays using cell-free supernatants. NETs were generated with
1×106 purified human neutrophils using PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) in low-bind Eppen-
dorf tubes. NETs were treated with 5 U DNase for 20 min for the complete dissolution
of NETs and the supernatants were collected. Samples were then concentrated using
10 K centrifuge filters (Microcon, Millipore). SP001 were grown to mid log phase. 10
µL of the concentrate was incubated with 90 µL of 2×106 CFU/mL of SP001 for 3 h at
37 °C in incubation buffer (10 mM Tris and 140 mM NaCl; pH = 7.4). This was
followed by plating of serial dilutions on blood agar plates and overnight incubation at
37 °C and CFUs were enumerated after 24 h. For MS analysis, protein estimation was
performed using the BCA kit (Pierce). Twenty micrograms of protein was taken for
digestion and peptide clean-up as described above.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with R version 3.2.3
and GraphPad Prism 7. One-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test
was used for all comparisons between groups, except for comparison between
groups for assessment of differences in weight loss, BBB permeability and IL-6
where Mann−Whitney U test was used; and for differences in the sum intensities
of spectra, where Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance and Wilcoxon rank
sum test between groups were used.
