Introduction
The prevalence of hyperglycaemia in hospital inpatients 
is increasing and poses a common clinical problem 
because of the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes.1,2 
Inpatient hyperglycaemia is a widely recognised marker 
of poor prognosis and is associated with increased 
morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and health-care 
costs.3,4 Guidelines for management of hyperglycaemia in 
inpatients outside the critical care setting have been 
proposed,5 but implementation is challenging and varied 
because of increased workload burden on ward staff
  and 
fear of hypoglycaemia. Development of eff
 ective and safe 
treatments that also reduce staff
  workload in the general 
ward is needed.
An automated system linking continuous glucose 
monitoring and insulin delivery could be a potential 
solution.6 Closed-loop insulin delivery, known as the 
artifi
 cial pancreas, is an emerging approach in which a 
control algorithm autonomously increases and decreases 
subcutaneous insulin delivery on the basis of real-time 
sensor glucose concentrations, thus approximating 
physiological insulin delivery.7 Studies of closed-loop 
insulin delivery at home in patients with type 1 diabetes 
have shown the safety and feasibility of the approach in 
improving glycaemic control and reducing the risk of 
hypoglycaemia.8,9
A closed-loop insulin delivery system has been shown 
to be safe and feasible in insulin-naive patients with 
type 2 diabetes in a controlled research facility setting.10 
We investigated the effi
  cacy and safety of automated 
closed-loop insulin de livery without meal-time boluses 
compared with conventional subcutaneous insulin 
therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes in the general 
ward.
Methods

Summary 
Background We assessed whether fully closed-loop insulin delivery (the so-called artifi
 cial pancreas) is safe and 
eff
 ective compared with standard subcutaneous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes in the general ward.
Methods For this single-centre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 
18 years or older with type 2 diabetes who were receiving insulin therapy. Patients were recruited from general wards 
at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated 
minimisation method to receive closed-loop insulin delivery (using a model-predictive control algorithm to direct 
subcutaneous delivery of rapid-acting insulin analogue without meal-time insulin boluses) or conventional 
subcutaneous insulin delivery according to local clinical guidelines. The primary outcome was time spent in the 
target glucose concentration range of 5·6–10·0 mmol/L during the 72 h study period. Analyses were by intention to 
treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774565.
Findings Between Feb 20, 2015, and March 24, 2016, we enrolled 40 participants, of whom 20 were randomly assigned 
to the closed-loop intervention group and 20 to the control group. The proportion of time spent in the target glucose 
range was 59·8% (SD 18·7) in the closed-loop group and 38·1% (16·7) in the control group (diff
 erence 21·8% [95% CI 
10·4–33·1]; p=0·0004). No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia with ketonaemia occurred in either 
group. One adverse event unrelated to study devices occurred during the study (gastrointestinal bleed). 
Interpretation Closed-loop insulin delivery without meal-time boluses is eff
 ective and safe in insulin-treated adults 
with type 2 diabetes in the general ward.

likely to interfere with the conduct of the study or 
interpretation of study results. Participants provided 
written informed consent before the start of study-related 
procedures. The study protocol was approved by the East 
of England Central Cambridge Ethics Committee.
Randomisation and masking
Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
receive fully automated closed-loop insulin delivery or 
conventional insulin therapy. Randomisation was done 
by a minimisation method using Minim randomisation 
software,11 which is a biased coin approach with a 
probability of 0·7–0·8 to allocating the best-fi
 tting 
treatment. Randomisation was stratifi
 ed according to 
HbA1c, BMI, and pre-study total insulin dose to ensure 
balance between the two groups. Investigators analysing 
study data were not masked to treatment allocation.
Procedures
Participants’ bodyweight, height, and total daily insulin 
dose were recorded after enrolment. Throughout the 
study, participants chose standard ward meals at usual 
meal times in the general ward. No restrictions were 
placed on consuming other meals and snacks or on 
usual activity in the general ward. Participants were 
followed up for a maximum of 72 h.
In the closed-loop insulin delivery group, participants’ 
usual insulin therapy and sulfonylurea medication, if 
prescribed, were discontinued on the day of closed-loop 
initiation, all other anti-diabetes medications were 
continued. A subcutaneous cannula was inserted by the 
investigator in the abdomen for delivery of insulin lispro 
(Humalog, Eli Lilly, IN, USA) by an insulin pump 
(Dana R Diabecare, Sooil, Seoul, South Korea). 
A subcutaneous, real-time, continuous glucose monitor 
(Freestyle Navigator II, Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, 
CA, USA) was inserted in the abdomen or upper arm by 
the investigator and calibrated according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. After successful sensor 
calibration when sensor glucose concentrations became 
available, automated closed-loop glucose control was 
started by the investigator and continued for 72 h. The 
low glucose alarm on the continuous glucose monitoring 
receiver was initially set at a threshold of 3·5 mmol/L.
The FlorenceD2W-T2 automated closed-loop system 
comprised a model predictive control algorithm 
(version 0.3.65) residing on a control algorithm device 
(Dell Latitude 10 Tablet, Dell, TX, USA) linked by a USB 
cable to the continuous glucose monitoring receiver 
(FreeStyle Navigator II). The tablet communicated with 
the study pump (Dana R Diabecare) via the Bluetooth 
wireless communication protocol.
The control algorithm was initialised with participant’s 
bodyweight and pre-study total daily insulin dose. 
No prandial insulin boluses were delivered and the control 
algorithm was not provided with timing or carbohydrate 
content of meals. Every 12 min, the control algorithm 
calculated the required insulin infusion rate based on 
sensor glucose measurements. The study pump was then 
instructed by wireless communication to alter or maintain 
insulin delivery rate. The control algorithm adapted to a 
particular participant by updating model parameters and 
refi
 ning the individual’s insulin requirements. The 
algorithm aimed to achieve glucose concentrations 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 2006 
and June 22, 2016, with the search terms (“closed-loop” OR 
“artifi
 cial pancreas”) AND (“type 2 diabetes” OR “inpatient 
hyperglycaemia” OR “stress hyperglycaemia” OR (“hospital” 
AND “hyperglycaemia”)) to identify other novel methods in the 
management of hyperglycaemia in inpatients. Apart from 
intravenous closed-loop insulin delivery in intensive care 
settings, no studies of fully closed-loop subcutaneous insulin 
delivery in the non-critical settings have been published to date. 
Added value of this study
We are not aware of any other study assessing automated 
fully closed-loop insulin delivery without meal-time boluses in 
adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes in the non-critical 
care setting. Our results showed a higher proportion of time 
spent in the target glucose range and reduced glucose 
variability with closed-loop insulin delivery compared with 
conventional therapy, without changing the total daily insulin 
dose or the time spent in hypoglycaemia. Reduction in 
overnight mean glucose concentration by closed-loop insulin 
delivery was achieved without increasing the risk of nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia. Taken together, our fi
 ndings suggest that an 
automated closed-loop insulin delivery system can potentially 
provide health-care professionals with a valuable clinical tool 
to manage inpatient hyperglycaemia safely and eff
 ectively 
while possibly reducing workload.
Implications of all the available evidence
Guidelines for the management of hyperglycaemia in 
inpatients have been published, with increased focus on 
integrated glycaemic management systems and education of 
health-care providers. Data from several inpatient audits and 
studies show that implementation in clinical practice is 
challenging because of the increasing workload on staff
  and 
the accelerating increase in the prevalence of diabetes. 
Technology remains underused in non-critical care 
management of inpatient hyperglycaemia. Further studies are 
needed to assess the potential of closed-loop insulin delivery 
and other technological approaches to improve clinical 
outcomes including assessing the eff
 ect on morbidity 
and mortality.

between 5·8 mmol/L and 7·2 mmol/L and adjusted the 
actual target threshold depending on accuracy of the 
model-based glucose predictions and prevailing glucose 
concentrations. Safety rules limited maximum insulin 
infusion rate on individual basis based on total daily dose 
and suspended insulin delivery at sensor glucose 
concentration of 4·2 mmol/L or lower, or when sensor 
glucose concentration was rapidly decreasing. In the event 
of sensor failure or loss of sensor availability, an audible 
alarm by the continuous glucose monitoring receiver 
sounded to alert the general ward staff
  or the research 
team. If sensor glucose measurements continued to be 
unavailable for 30 min, the study pump insulin infusion 
rate reverted to the individual’s preprogrammed basal rate. 
For longer interruptions of sensor glucose measurements, 
the control algorithm could be provided with capillary 
glucose measurements to direct insulin delivery.
Once-daily subcutaneous basal insulin glargine (Sanofi
 , 
Gentilly, France), at 20% of the participant’s pre-study total 
daily insulin dose, was proposed during risk analysis by 
the interdisciplinary research team to mitigate against the 
risk of severe hyperglycaemia associated with ketonaemia 
in the event of prolonged pump disconnection for specifi
 c 
clinically indicated procedures such as MRI, when insulin 
pump use is contraindicated. This approach was chosen 
because no studies of closed-loop insulin delivery had 
been done in this population of patients, practical 
information was missing within the general ward setting 
to inform potential safety mitigation, and the dose 
administered was unlikely to aff
 ect effi
  cacy outcomes. The 
basal insulin dose was kept constant and not titrated 
throughout the study period. Point-of-care capillary 
glucose measurements (Nova Stat Strip, Nova Biomedical, 
MA, USA) were taken by nursing ward staff
  according to 
usual clinical practice. These measurements were not 
used to inform or change insulin delivery rate. At the end 
of the closed-loop period, participants completed a brief 
questionnaire providing feedback on satisfaction of 
glucose 
control 
while 
receiving 
the 
closed-loop 
intervention, such as wearability and mobility with the 
devices, trust of the closed-loop device to deliver insulin, 
and whether they would recommend the closed-loop 
intervention to others. Participants’ usual insulin therapy 
and, as appropriate, sulfonylurea medication was re-
started at the end of the closed-loop intervention.
In the conventional insulin therapy group, participants’ 
usual insulin and other antihyperglycaemic therapy was 
continued throughout the 72 h study period. A continuous 
glucose monitoring receiver (Freestyle Navigator II) was 
modifi
 ed to mask sensor glucose concentrations to the 
participant, investigators, and ward staff
 . The continuous 
glucose monitoring sensor was inserted in the general 
ward by the clinical investigator on the fi
 rst day of the 
study and calibrated according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Point-of-care capillary glucose measurements 
were taken by nursing ward staff
  (Nova Stat Strip). 
Participants’ glucose control was managed by the clinical

team according to local clinical practice. The clinical team 
was allowed to modify and adjust insulin or other 
antihyperglycaemic therapy and instigate additional 
point-of-care 
capillary 
glucose 
measurements 
as 
appropriate.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was time spent in the target 
glucose concentration range of 5·6–10·0 mmol/L during 
the 72 h study period, as recorded by sensor glucose 
measurements. Secondary effi
  cacy outcomes were the 
time spent at glucose concentrations lower than 
5·6 mmol/L and greater than 10·0 mmol/L, area under 
the curve less than 3·5 mmol/L, mean sensor glucose 
concentration, and total daily insulin dose. Glucose 
variability was assessed by the SD and the coeffi
  cient of 
variation of sensor glucose concentration using data 
collected from the whole study period. The between-day 
coeffi
  cient of variation of sensor glucose concentration 
was calculated from daily mean glucose measurements 
(0000–0000 h). Daytime (0800–0000 h) and overnight 
(0000–0800 h) outcomes were calculated for a subset of 
outcomes to limit multiple comparisons. These outcomes 
included time in the target range, time spent at 
concentrations greater than the target range, mean 
sensor glucose concentration, the SD and the coeffi
  cient 
of variation of sensor glucose concentration, the between-
day or between-night coeffi
  cient of variation of sensor 
glucose concentration, and area under the curve less 
than 3·5 mmol/L using data from the respective periods. 
The mean pre-meal and pre-bed capillary glucose 
concentration at each defi
 ned time period was calculated 
for each participant for the whole study period. Safety 
endpoints included clinically signifi
 cant hypoglycaemic 
episodes (<3·5 mmol/L) and other adverse and serious 
adverse events in accordance with ISO 14155 reporting.
Statistical analysis
Findings from previous studies of closed-loop insulin 
delivery in patients with type 1 diabetes show that time 
when sensor glucose concentration is in the target range 
(primary endpoint) has an SD of 21%.12–14 We calculated 
that with 18 participants per group, a diff
 erence of 20% 
between groups could be detected with a power of 80% 
using two-sided unpaired t test at a 5% signifi
 cance level. 
A diff
 erence of 20% was deemed clinically relevant. 
The group size was increased to 20 to mitigate against 
possible diff
 erences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
The statistical analysis plan was agreed by the 
investigators in advance. Outcomes were calculated with 
GStat software (version 2.2) and statistical analyses were 
done with SPSS (version 21). Because of the sample size, 
we used an unpaired t test to compare variables with the 
exception of highly skewed variables, when we used a 
Mann-Whitney U test. The number of events related to 
capillary glucose concentrations of less than 2·8 mmol/L 
and more than 20·0 mmol/L was tabulated in each

Results
Between Feb 20, 2015, and March 24, 2016, we recruited 
40 participants, of whom 20 were randomly assigned to 
the closed-loop intervention and 20 to the control group 
(fi
 gure 1). One participant in the closed-loop group was 
withdrawn from the study because of acute gastrointestinal 
bleeding unrelated to study procedures, which required 
immediate surgical intervention and admission to the 
intensive care unit. Reasons for admission to hospital 
included infected foot ulcer (30 patients), ischaemic 
diabetic foot (four patients), congestive cardiac failure 
(four patients), and urinary tract infection (two patients). 
Table 1 summarises baseline characteristics (see appendix 
for details of pre-study treatment including the number of 
insulin injections per day). The insulin dose in the control 
group was adjusted by the general ward staff
  according to 
standard clinical practice; however, no additional 
injections or subcutaneous insulin sliding scale were 
given during the study.
The proportion of time spent in the target glucose 
concentration range (5·6–10·0 mmol/L) was higher in 
the closed-loop group than in the control group 
(59·8% [SD 18·7] vs 38·1% [16·7], respectively; diff
 erence 
21·8% [95% CI 10·4–33·1]; p=0·0004; table 2). Mean 
sensor glucose concentration was lower, although not 
signifi
 cantly, in the closed-loop group than in the control 
group (p=0·065; table 2; fi
 gure 2). The proportion of 
time spent at concentrations greater than the target 
range (ie, >10·0 mmol/L) was signifi
 cantly lower in the 
closed-loop 
group 
than 
in 
the 
control 
group 
(diff
 erence 19·0% [95% CI 4·7–33·3]; p=0·011), whereas 
the time spent at concentrations lower than the target 
range (ie, <5·6 mmol/L) did not diff
 er between groups 
(p=0·51; table 2). Time spent at concentrations lower 
than 3·5 mmol/L and burden of hypoglycaemia as 
measured by area under the curve less than 3·5 mmol/L 
were low and similar between groups (table 2). 
Five hypoglycaemic events were detected and notifi
 ed by 
low sensor glucose alarm in three patients receiving 
closed-loop 
insulin 
delivery. 
Oral 
carbohydrate 
treatment (20 g) was given during each event by the 
general ward staff
 , without the need for intravenous 
dextrose.
Glucose variability during closed-loop insulin delivery 
was signifi
 cantly reduced compared with conventional 
insulin therapy, as measured by the SD (p=0·007) and 
the coeffi
  cient of variation of sensor glucose concentration 
(p=0·042; table 2). Participants in the closed-loop group 
had higher overall time spent within the target range 
without a signifi
 cant increase in total daily insulin 
delivery (p=0·78). Glycaemic outcomes based on 
pre-meal and pre-bed capillary glucose concentrations 
did not diff
 er between study groups (table 3).
The proportion of time when overnight (0000–0800 h) 
glucose was in the target range was signifi
 cantly higher 
in the closed-loop group than in the control group 
(diff
 erence 20·1% [95% CI 5·9–34·3]; p=0·007; table 4). 
The nocturnal burden of hypoglycaemia as measured by 
area under the curve less than 3·5 mmol/L did not 
diff
 er between groups (p=0·59). Glucose variability

measured by the SD (p=0·030) and the between-night 
coeffi
  cient of variation of sensor glucose con-
centration (p=0·011) was reduced with closed-loop 
therapy compared with conventional therapy. Results 
from the daytime period (0800–0000 h; table 4) showed 
that the proportion of time spent in the target glucose 
concentration range was signifi
 cantly higher in the 
closed-loop group than in the control group (p=0·002). 
Daytime glucose variability, as measured by the SD of 
sensor glucose concentration (p=0·011) and the 
overall (p=0·039) and between-day (p=0·018) coeffi
  cient 
of variation of sensor glucose concentration, was 
reduced in the closed-loop group compared with the 
control group. We noted no signifi
 cant diff
 erences in 
mean sensor glucose concentration and area under the 
curve less than 3·5 mmol/L during the daytime period.
Total time of sensor glucose availability was similar in 
the two groups (appendix). Glucose sensors were 
replaced seven times in the closed-loop group (fi
 ve 
because of sensor failures, two because of MRI scanning 
procedures) and three times in the control group 
(twice because of sensor failures, once because of MRI 
scanning procedure). The insulin pump device was 
removed on two occasions during the study because of 
MRI scanning procedures. No insulin pump failures 
occurred during the study.
No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia 
with ketonaemia occurred in either group. One adverse 
event unrelated to study devices occurred in the closed-
loop group (gastrointestinal bleed). No serious adverse 
event occurred in either group. 17 (85%) of 20 participants 
in the closed-loop group stated that they were happy with 
their glucose concentrations in hospital during the study 
and 18 (90%) were happy to have their glucose 
concentrations controlled automatically by the closed-
loop system (fi
 gure 3). 19 (95%) would recommend the 
system to a friend or family member if they were 
admitted to hospital.
Discussion
Our results suggest that the use of a fully automated 
closed-loop insulin delivery system in patients with 
insulin-treated type 2 diabetes in the general ward is safe 
and feasible. Compared with the local hospital protocol 
for glucose management, time when sensor glucose 
concentration was in the target range was signifi
 cantly 
improved with the closed-loop delivery system, without 
increased risk of hypoglycaemia.
Professional societies’ recommendations of target 
glucose concentrations in non-critical care settings (pre-
meal blood glucose targets of <5·6 mmol/L, and random 
blood glucose concentrations of <10·0 mmol/L) are not 
currently attainable by many health-care institutions.1,15 
These trends of suboptimal glucose control are seen even 
when speciality input is available.16 In our study, time 
within the recommended target glucose range was 
increased by closed-loop insulin delivery by roughly 22% 
 
compared with a matched cohort receiving usual care. 
This outcome was achieved without an increase in the 
amount of insulin delivered, thereby further minimising 
the risk of hypoglycaemia. Although time spent in 
hypoglycaemia was similar in both groups, it was notably 
low in the control group. Avoidance and fear of 
hypoglycaemia is a primary concern of many health-care 
professionals caring for inpatients with diabetes, which 
might have contributed to this fi
 nding. Inpatient 
hypoglycaemia, either iatrogenic or disease-related, is 
associated with poorer outcomes such as increased 
morbidity and mortality.17 The length of hospital stay is 
prolonged by hypoglycaemia, aff
 ecting overall health-care

cost.18 Several vulnerable populations in the general ward 
are known to be at an increased risk, such as older people 
(≥65 years) or individuals with poor nutritional intake. 
Severe hyperglycaemia with ketonaemia in potentially 
insulin-defi
 cient patients was mitigated by administration 
of basal insulin at 20% of pre-study insulin dose during 
the closed-loop intervention. The likelihood of ketonaemia 
in the studied population is inherently low, however, and 
we consider that regular administration of basal insulin 
injections might not be required in future studies.
Measures of sensor glucose variability during closed-
loop insulin delivery seem to be consistently reduced 
compared with during conventional insulin therapy. 
Glycaemic fl
 uctuations are known to occur in hospital 
inpatients as a result of nutritional status and intake, as 
well as changes in insulin sensitivity during the period of 
illness. 
The 
advantage 
of 
an 
automated-control, 
algorithm-directed insulin delivery system such as ours, 
compared with conventional insulin therapy, is the fi
 nely 
tuned frequent modulation of insulin delivery according 
to sensor glucose concentrations, thereby trading 
variability of insulin delivery with glycaemic consistency. 
Previous studies, predominantly in critical care settings, 
have reported a link between increased glucose variability 
and endothelial dysfunction19 and mortality.20 Our study 
was not statistically powered for these outcomes; thus, 
large, well designed studies are needed to establish 
whether reduction in glycaemic variability and improved 
glucose control by closed-loop insulin delivery, specifi
 cally 
in non-critical care settings, could have clinically 
meaningful and benefi
 cial eff
 ects.
Intravenous closed-loop insulin delivery systems have 
been studied in intensive care settings.21–23 The need for 
intravascular access for insulin delivery in these studies 
limits use in the non-critical care general ward settings.  A 
randomised study24 was performed in hospitalised non-
critical care type 2 diabetes patients, comparing standard 
glycaemic 
management 
with 
workfl
 ow-integrated 
algorithm for basal bolus insulin therapy, which ward staff
  
accessed via a tablet device. Over a 7 day period, time in 
target range (3·9–10 mmol/L) and mean blood glucose 
levels were signifi
 cantly improved in the algorithm group. 
Patients in the algorithm group who applied blinded 
continuous glucose monitoring, however, had numerous 
hypoglycaemic events (sensor glucose <3·9 mmol/L) 
during the daytime. Post-hoc analysis suggests that higher 
lunchtime blood glucose which required higher correction 
insulin boluses may have been contributory. The 
aforementioned computerised glucose management 
system depends on ward staff
  input at meal times. Other 
novel strategies for inpatient glucose control include the 
use of GLP-1 and DPP-4 inhibitor based therapies, which 
are thought to have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia due to 
their glucose-dependent action.25,26 However adverse eff
 ect 
profi
 les such as nausea and vomiting may limit their use 
in hospital, especially in those with swallowing diffi
  culties 
and at increased risk of aspiration.
The strength of our study is the novel application of an 
automated closed-loop insulin delivery system in a real-
world general ward environment. The closed-loop system 
used off
 -the-shelf devices including a commercially 
available subcutaneous real-time continuous glucose 
monitor and insulin pump, thereby reducing regulatory 
complexity and accelerating availability of the system for 
future clinical use. No prandial insulin delivery was 
administered, reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia caused 
by delayed or reduced meal consumption and skipped 
meals, while also reducing staff
  workload. In the control 
group, glucose control was managed according to local 
hospital guidelines refl
 ecting real-world practice in 
which wider use of basal-bolus insulin therapy in hospital 
as recommended by experts in the fi
 eld is not always 
feasible or safe.
Our study is limited by a single-centre setting, a short 
duration, and a predominance of patients with foot ulcers 
who were approached in view of their expected longer stay 
in 
hospital. 
Another 
potential 
limitation 
is 
the 
administration of daily basal insulin glargine in the 
closed-loop group, and not the control group, instigated 
during the initial study design phase to mitigate against 
potential ketonaemia in the event of prolonged pump 
disconnection. Because no historical data were available 
for the risk assessment before our study, this precaution 
was implemented until corroborative data related to 
closed-loop use in this unique population were available. 
Supportive fi
 ndings from the present work provide 
justifi
 cation to omit daily basal insulin glargine from 
future studies as a pragmatic measure to reduce staff
 
 
workload without the need for a pilot study. The dose of 
basal insulin glargine given in our study, maintained at a 
constant dose throughout, is estimated to account for 
between 10% and 20% of the total (the sum of endogenous 
and exogenous) insulin concentration in type 2 diabetes,21 
thus negligible in terms of effi
  cacy in view of the adaptive 
nature of the closed-loop algorithm, which needs to cope 
with more than 30-times greater changes in insulin needs. 
Finally, the availability of low sensor glucose alarms in the 
closed-loop group might have potentially mitigated 
against hypo 
glycaemia events compared with the control 
group. Continuous glucose monitoring is currently not 
recom 
mended as part of usual clinical care in the general 
ward, while being an integral part of closed-loop systems. 
Therefore, low sensor glucose alarms in addition to 
automated modulation of insulin delivery based on real-
time sensor glucose concentrations, could support the 
incremental benefi
 t of the closed-loop intervention in the 
general ward.
Although no formal feedback was collected from the 
ward staff
 , there was no interruption to the ward 
workfl
 ow and patients’ usual ward-related activities from 
the closed-loop intervention. Patient feedback from 
closed-loop use suggests that the system acceptability 
was high, with most patients happy to have their glucose 
control managed autonomously by the closed-loop

system, and suggest a substantial level of trust by 
patients. The absence of feedback from the control group 
limits interpretation on whether the closed-loop 
intervention 
improved 
patients’ 
experience 
and 
perception of glucose control management in hospital.
In conclusion, our fi
 ndings show that automated 
closed-loop insulin delivery without meal-time boluses, 
or provision of information about meals to the control 
algorithm, in adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes 
is safe and feasible in the non-critical care setting. 
However, further and longer studies are warranted.
