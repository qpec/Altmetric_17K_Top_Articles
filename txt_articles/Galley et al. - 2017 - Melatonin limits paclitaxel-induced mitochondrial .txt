Abstract
Chemotherapy- 
induced neuropathic pain is a debilitating and common side effect of 
cancer treatment. Mitochondrial dysfunction associated with oxidative stress in 
 
peripheral nerves has been implicated in the underlying mechanism. We investigated 
the potential of melatonin, a potent antioxidant that preferentially acts within mito-
chondria, to reduce mitochondrial damage and neuropathic pain resulting from the 
chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel. In vitro, paclitaxel caused a 50% reduction in 
 
mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic rate, independent of concentration 
(20- 
100 μmol/L). Mitochondrial volume was increased dose- 
dependently by pacli-
taxel (200% increase at 100 μmol/L). These effects were prevented by co- 
treatment 
with 1 μmol/L melatonin. Paclitaxel cytotoxicity against cancer cells was not  
affected 
by co- 
exposure to 1 μmol/L melatonin of either the breast cancer cell line MCF- 
7 or 
the ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780. In a rat model of paclitaxel- 
induced painful 
peripheral neuropathy, pretreatment with oral melatonin (5/10/50 mg/kg), given as a 
daily bolus dose, was protective, dose- 
dependently limiting development of mechan-
ical hypersensitivity (19/43/47% difference from paclitaxel control, respectively). 
Melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) was similarly effective when administered continuously 
in drinking water (39% difference). Melatonin also reduced paclitaxel- 
induced 
 
elevated 8- 
isoprostane F2α levels in peripheral nerves (by 22% in sciatic; 41% in 
 
saphenous) and limited paclitaxel- 
induced reduction in C-fibre activity- 
dependent 
slowing (by 64%). Notably, melatonin limited the development of mechanical hyper-
sensitivity in both male and female animals (by 50/41%, respectively), and an addi-
tive effect was found when melatonin was given with the current treatment, duloxetine 
(75/62% difference, respectively). Melatonin is therefore a potential treatment to 
limit the development of painful neuropathy resulting from chemotherapy 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION
A common side effect of cancer treatment is chemotherapy- 
induced neuropathic pain (CINP), which can be severe 
enough to require dose reduction or treatment cessation, 
with consequent effects on survival and the quality of life 
of patients with cancer.1,2 This predominantly sensory neu-
ropathy affects up to 68% of patients in the first month after 
finishing chemotherapy, with around 30% of patients still 
being symptomatic more than 6 months later1. CINP may 
not resolve and in some cases can worsen with time. Current 
treatment options are based mainly on evidence from 
other types of neuropathic pain;3 duloxetine, a serotonin- 
norepinephrine re- 
uptake inhibitor, is one of the few agents 
with direct evidence of efficacy for CINP.4 All of the cur-
rently used agents have significant limitations both in terms 
of efficacy and side effects. There is an urgent need for a 
treatment, which addresses the neuropathic mechanisms, 
and can prevent or alleviate CINP.
Paclitaxel is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent 
with a high incidence of CINP.1 It has been shown to 
cause  
mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro5 and in periph-
eral nerves and dorsal root ganglia in vivo,6,7 associated 
with oxidative stress. Administration of mitochondrial 
poisons in animals exacerbated paclitaxel- 
induced neuro-
pathic pain,8 whilst global radical scavengers (spin traps)9, 
mitochondrial electron transport chain modulators10 and 
reduction in mitochondrial damage with a small- 
molecule 
P53 inhibitor11 or acetyl carnitine12 were associated with 
decreases in neuropathic pain behaviours. These studies 
support the notion that CINP induced by paclitaxel is 
mediated by oxidative damage to mitochondria, and sug-
gest that targeting treatments specifically at mitochon-
dria may be beneficial. Our previous work showed that 
the mitochondria targeted antioxidant MitoVitE was able 
to reduce mechanical hypersensitivity in rats treated with 
 
paclitaxel.13 However, MitoVitE has not been through 
Phase I studies, and its use cannot be rapidly translated 
into the clinical arena.
We have previously reported that MitoVitE and melatonin 
are equally effective at reducing mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion and markers of inflammation in other disease models 
both in vitro and in animals.14 Melatonin, like MitoVitE, 
is able to accumulate inside mitochondria and is a potent 
antioxidant; its metabolites and reaction products are also 
effective.15,16 Melatonin has been given safely to humans 
with no evidence of toxicity even at very high doses.17 We 
therefore hypothesized that melatonin would reduce mito-
chondrial damage induced by paclitaxel in neuronal cells 
in vitro and would alleviate, and/or limit the development 
of, mechanical hypersensitivity and altered peripheral nerve 
function in a preclinical rat model of paclitaxel- 
induced 
painful neuropathy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | In vitro studies
The 50B11 immortalized dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neu-
ronal stem cell line was kindly donated by Professor Ahmet 
Hoke, from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, 
MA, USA. These cells have nociceptive properties: after 
differentiation, they extend neurites and generate action po-
tentials when depolarized, express key nociceptive mark-
ers and respond to capsaicin.18 Culture and maintenance of 
these cells is described in our previous study.13 They were 
differentiated into DRGs by exposure to 75 μmol/L forskolin 
for 24 hours, with outgrowth of neurites starting after about 
10 hours. After differentiation, a range of concentrations of 
paclitaxel was added with and without 1 μmol/L melatonin 
or relevant solvent control for 24 hours.
2.1.1 | Mitochondrial function
Mitochondrial function was determined in intact cells after 
24 hours treatment, by measurement of the mitochondrial 
membrane potential using the fluorescent probe JC- 
1 (5,5,6,6
- 
tetrachloro- 
1,1,3,3- 
tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine io-
dide, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), and by measurement of met-
abolic activity using the rate of reduction of AlamarBlue™ 
(Invitrogen).13,15 Mitotracker Green FM™ (Invitrogen) was 
used to determine mitochondrial volume.19-21 Cell viability 
after treatments was measured as acid phosphatase activity as 
we have described previously and measures of mitochondrial 
function were corrected for viable cell number.22
2.1.2 | Cancer cell cytotoxicity
As melatonin might affect the cytotoxic capacity of pacli-
taxel against cancer cells, we measured paclitaxel- 
induced 
killing of the breast adenocarcinoma- 
like oestrogen- 
sensitive 
cell line, MCF- 
7, and the ovarian carcinoma cell line, A2780, 
in the presence of melatonin. Cancer cells were cultured for 
24 hours with 0- 
100 μmol/L paclitaxel, with and without 
1 μmol/L melatonin or solvent control as we have described 
for MitoVitE previously.13 Acid phosphatase activity was 
used to assess cell viability as for DRG cells.
2.2 | Animal model
The animal work was approved by the UK Home Office 
and carried out in accordance with Animals (Scientific 
Procedures) Act 1986, following applicable aspects of the 
ARRIVE Guidelines.23 Animal health and welfare was para-
mount throughout all studies, and animals were checked 
daily for any signs of distress. Weight gain and cage behav-
iour were continually recorded. All animals were handled as 
    |

gently as possible, and cage bedding was ample, to provide a 
soft environment.
Male and female Sprague Dawley rats weighing approxi-
mately 300 g were housed with a maximum of 6 (single sex) 
per cage in standard conditions, at 19- 
22°C, on a 12- 
hour 
light/dark cycle from 7 am to 7 pm. Food and drinking water 
were provided ad libitum. The rats were kept in the experi-
mental area for a minimum of 3 days before baseline testing 
was started. Details of the model have been published previ-
ously13,24 and are described only briefly here.
As rats were group housed, treatment group allocation 
was undertaken by cage rather than individual animal to avoid 
contamination by coprophagia. Rats received either 4 × doses 
of 2 mg/kg paclitaxel or cremophor/EL (polyethoxylated cas-
tor oil, the vehicle control for paclitaxel) diluted in saline, by 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection every second day.
2.2.1 | Behavioural assessment of 
mechanical sensitivity
Pseudo- 
blinding of treatment allocation was achieved by 
mixing animals from all treatment groups immediately before 
testing; group allocation was only confirmed by tail number 
when testing was complete. Prior to mechanical sensitivity 
testing, animals were acclimatized in 2 × 20 minute sessions 
on separate days and further habituated for 20 minutes im-
mediately before testing on any given day. Hind paw plantar 
withdrawal thresholds to von Frey filaments were determined 
every 2- 
6 days throughout the model, using the up- 
down 
method,25 as we have described previously.13
2.2.2 | Effect of bolus doses of melatonin
To assess the effect of pretreatment with bolus doses of 
 
melatonin, male rats (n = 5- 
6 per group) were given 1 of 3 
bolus doses of melatonin (5, 10 or 50 mg/kg, 2 μl/g body 
weight) or 10% ethanol vehicle control by daily oral gav-
age (between 10:00 and 11:00 hours) starting 3 days prior to 
paclitaxel or control treatment. Mechanical sensitivity was 
measured 1, 6 and 24 hours after gavage every second or third 
day. In a separate study, male rats were given a bolus dose of 
10 mg/kg melatonin by oral gavage, then blood samples were 
obtained by cardiac puncture from groups of rats (n = 3 per 
group) at 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after dosing, or untreated 
controls, to determine the pharmacokinetics of melatonin.
2.2.3 | Effect of melatonin given in 
drinking water
We also administered melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle 
control (0.1% v/v ethanol) in drinking water starting 3 days 
before paclitaxel treatment, to groups of male rats (n = 5- 
6 
per group). A control group received saline (i.p.) plus 
melatonin in drinking water to determine whether melatonin 
impacted upon baseline mechanical sensitivity. To maintain 
10 mg/kg/day melatonin dose, the concentration of mela-
tonin was adjusted to account for mean water consumption 
over the previous 2 days, and average current weight of rats 
in a given cage. Opaque bottles were used and changed every 
2 days. Levels of melatonin in drinking water were measured 
as described for serum below to confirm that melatonin levels 
were stable for at least 48 hours under these conditions. The 
actual levels of water consumption were consistently similar 
to that of water with vehicle control. After experimentation, 
blood was collected by cardiac puncture and serum mela-
tonin levels were determined.
The effect of discontinuing or starting melatonin treat-
ment after mechanical hypersensitivity had developed was 
also assessed. Groups of rats (n = 6) received either mela-
tonin or vehicle control in drinking water continuously start-
ing 3 days before paclitaxel as above; melatonin starting 
3 days before paclitaxel then stopping (reverting to vehicle 
control) at day 18 once the hypersensitivity was apparent; or 
vehicle starting 3 days before paclitaxel then commencing 
melatonin treatment at day 20 once the hypersensitivity was 
fully established.
The combination of melatonin with the current CINP 
treatment, duloxetine, was also assessed. By targeting mul-
tiple mechanisms,26 we hypothesized that there would be an 
additive effect on paclitaxel- 
induced mechanical hypersensi-
tivity. Given increasing awareness of sex differences in pain 
and analgesic sensitivity,27,28 this was investigated in both 
sexes. Male and female rats (n = 6 per group) were given 
melatonin or vehicle control in drinking water starting 3 days 
before paclitaxel as above, plus daily i.p. injections of dulox-
etine (10 mg/kg/day; 1 μl/g body weight) or vehicle control 
(20% ethanol in saline), starting when the mechanical hyper-
sensitivity had established.
2.2.4 | Sedation testing
Prior to behavioural testing, rats were assessed on a 5- 
point 
scale for righting reflexes: 0, the rat struggles when placed 
on its side, followed by rapid forceful righting; 1, moderate 
resistance when the rat is placed on its side, with rapid but not 
forceful righting; 2, no resistance to the rat being placed on 
its side, with effortful but ultimately successful righting; 3, 
unsuccessful righting; and 4, no movements.29
2.2.5 | Serum melatonin levels
Rats were anesthetized by brief inhalation of isoflurane fol-
lowed by overdose of 20% w/v pentobarbitone (~1 g/kg) 
given by i.p. injection. The chest cavity was rapidly opened, 
and the right atrium was punctured to collect blood for serum 
samples. Melatonin levels were determined in serum and

drinking water using a Thermo Surveyor- 
TSQ Quantum liq-
uid chromatography tandem- 
mass spectrometry (LC- 
MS/
MS) system (Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). 
This assay has a lower limit of quantitation of 0.5 ng/ml and 
high inter- and intra- 
assay precision, as we have previously 
described in detail.17
2.2.6 | 8- 
isoprostane F2α levels
F2- 
isoprostanes, which are one of the most reliable meas-
ures of oxidative stress status in vivo,30 were measured ex 
vivo in peripheral nerve tissue 19 days after paclitaxel/
cremophor treatment and included experimental animals 
from the bolus dosing experiments receiving melatonin 
at 10 mg/kg or vehicle treatment. Rats were decapitated 
under isoflurane anaesthesia and sciatic and saphenous 
nerve tissue were removed, placed in ice cold 0.1 mol/L 
phosphate buffer and homogenized, then centrifuged and 
frozen at −80°C. Tissue was collected throughout the day 
with animals from different treatment groups interleaved 
to ensure all treatment groups were collected over com-
parable time windows. F2α levels were assessed using a 
commercially available 8- 
isoprostane F2α ELISA kit (Enzo 
Lifesciences, Exeter, UK). The lower limit of detection is 
40 mg/ml with median intra- 
 and interassay coefficients of 
variation of 5.7% and 5.8%, respectively.
2.2.7 | C-fibre activity- 
dependent slowing
C-fibre function was assayed by quantifying C-fibre activity- 
dependent slowing (ADS) in peripheral nerve tissue from 
male rats receiving cremophor or paclitaxel with and with-
out 10 mg/kg melatonin in drinking water 14- 
18 days fol-
lowing the start of paclitaxel or vehicle treatment. Rats were 
decapitated under isoflurane anaesthesia, at the same time 
in the morning, and lumbar (L4/5) dorsal roots, minus dor-
sal root ganglia, were isolated and incubated at 36°- 
37°C in 
oxygenated recovery solution for 1 hour. Following incuba-
tion, tissue was transferred to the recording bath of an upright 
microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and continuously 
perfused with oxygenated Krebs’ solution (1- 
2 ml/min) at 
room temperature. The 95% O2/5% CO2 saturated Krebs’ 
solution contained (in mmol/L) the following: 125 NaCl, 
2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3 25 glucose, 1 MgCl2, 
2 CaCl2 pH7.4. Recovery solution was identical to Krebs’ 
solution apart from 6 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.5 mmol/L CaCl2.
Compound action potential recordings were carried out 
using 2 glass suction electrodes, one for electrical stimulation 
and the second for field potential recording, as we have de-
scribed previously.31,32 Dorsal roots were stimulated with an 
Iso- 
flex stimulus isolator (A.M.P.I. Jerusalem, Israel), and data 
were acquired and recorded using a Cygnus ER- 
1 differential 
amplifier (Cygnus Technologies Inc. Delaware, PA, USA) 
and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, 
USA). Data were filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz.
The characteristic triphasic (positive- 
negative- 
positive) 
C-fibre component of the compound action potential was 
identified, based on activation threshold and conduction ve-
locity, which were not altered by treatment (Table 1).
To assess the frequency- 
dependent phenomenon of 
C-fibre ADS,33,34 dorsal roots were stimulated ×40 (500 μA 
intensity, 0.1 ms duration) at frequencies of 1 Hz and 2 Hz. 
For each stimulus, the response width (first to last positive 
peak), indicative of the range of conduction velocities within 
the C-fibre population, was measured and the change in 
width from stimulus 1 calculated. Width change was normal-
ized to the length of root stimulated, measured as the distance 
between the recording and stimulating electrodes.
2.2.8 | Statistical analysis
For in vitro studies, 6 separate experiments with 4 techni-
cal replicates were undertaken (n = 6). Data are presented as 
median, interquartile and full range, and statistical analysis 
was undertaken using Analyse- 
it Add- 
in for Microsoft Excel 
(Analyse- 
it Software Ltd., Leeds, UK). Kruskal- 
Wallis anal-
ysis of variance was used for each in vitro treatment, with 
Mann- 
Whitney post hoc testing and correction for multiple 
comparisons as appropriate.
For in vivo studies, area under the curve (AUC) of me-
chanical thresholds or C-fibre ADS was first calculated; then, 
all data were analysed by one- 
way or two- 
way ANOVA with 
appropriate post hoc testing as detailed (GraphPad Prism 7 
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Behavioural and C-fibre

RESULTS
3.1 | In vitro studies
3.1.1 | Cancer cell cytotoxicity
Paclitaxel caused loss of DRG cell viability of cancer cells 
such that median [range] viability in A2780 cells was 60.0 
[52.1- 
68.6]% in the presence of 100 μmol/L paclitaxel 
without melatonin and 56.6 [48.0- 
64.3]% with 100 μmol/L 
 
paclitaxel plus 1 μmol/L melatonin. Viability of MCF7 cells 
was 39.2 [15.8- 
41.3]% with paclitaxel without melatonin and 
36.3 [18.9- 
55.4]% with melatonin, indicating that cell kill-
ing by paclitaxel was not reduced by co- 
exposure of cells to 
 
melatonin in either of the cancer cell lines.
3.1.2 | Mitochondrial function
Treatment of DRG cells with paclitaxel without melatonin 
resulted in significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane 
potential as shown by a ~50% reduction in JC- 
1 red/green 
fluorescence ratio, regardless of dose (P < .0001, Figure 1A). 
When cells were co- 
exposed to paclitaxel plus melatonin, 
membrane potential actually increased except at the high-
est concentration of paclitaxel (Figure 1A). Mitochondrial 
metabolic activity was also significantly reduced when DRG 
cells were treated with paclitaxel, independently of dose 
(P < .0001, Figure 1B); no such reduction was seen when 
cells were co- 
treated with melatonin (Figure 1B). Paclitaxel 
exposure of DRG cells caused a marked dose- 
dependent in-
crease in mitochondrial volume (Figure 1C, P < .0001), and 
in cells co- 
treated with melatonin, this effect was not seen 
(Figure 1C).
3.2 | In vivo studies
Melatonin administration did not produce sedative effects; 
all rats, irrespective of treatment, scored zero on the 5- 
point 
scale for righting reflexes (data not shown). Melatonin also 
did not impact upon weight gain in any experimental group 
tested (Fig. S1).
3.2.1 | Bolus dosing with melatonin
Paclitaxel administration caused a reduction in mechanical 
withdrawal threshold values that developed progressively 
over 2 weeks, as we have shown previously13 (Figure 2A).

Rats receiving paclitaxel plus melatonin by oral gavage had 
less mechanical hypersensitivity compared with rats given 
paclitaxel plus vehicle (Figure 2A and B, P < .0001). AUC 
analysis of mechanical withdrawal thresholds revealed that 
melatonin limited mechanical hypersensitivity at all 3 doses 
given. However, there was no additional effect of 50 mg/kg 
melatonin compared to 10 mg/kg. Notably, the reduction in 
hypersensitivity was independent of when sensitivity testing 
was performed in relation to dosing, as similar effects were 
observed when testing was performed at 1, 6 or 24 hours after 
the bolus dose was given (Figure 2B). In contrast, there was 
a marked increase (~400- 
fold) in serum melatonin levels at 
1 h after dosing, which had returned to baseline values by 
24 hours (Figure 2C). Six rats were allocated to each treat-
ment group at the start of the study; however, data from 3 
rats (×1 vehicle, ×1 5 mg/kg melatonin, ×1 50 mg/kg mela-
tonin treated) were excluded as they were euthanized before 
the end of the study due to complications with repeated oral 
gavage.
3.2.2 | Melatonin in drinking water
Administration of melatonin in drinking water facilitated 
longer- 
term monitoring of the effect of melatonin upon 
paclitaxel- 
induced mechanical hypersensitivity that progres-
sively develops over 2 weeks before then plateauing at peak 
hypersensitivity for around 2 weeks (Figure 3A). Melatonin 
alone did not affect mechanical sensitivity in naïve subjects 
as assessed using AUC analysis of mechanical withdrawal 
thresholds (Figure 3A and B). Melatonin therefore does not 
appear to produce sedative effects that would confound as-
sessment of its effect upon mechanical hypersensitivity in 
neuropathic animals. Rats given paclitaxel plus 10 mg/kg 
 
melatonin in drinking water had less mechanical hypersen-
sitivity than rats given paclitaxel plus vehicle throughout 
the time course of the model (Figure 3A- 
C, P < .0001). 
Comparison of the effect of 10 mg/kg/day melatonin given 
as oral gavage or drinking water, using AUC analysis of 
data from day 2- 
17 after paclitaxel administration started, 
revealed that the melatonin effect was not dependent on the 
administration route (Figure 3C, melatonin P < .0001; inter-
action P = .49). Serum melatonin levels on day 42 in animals 
given melatonin were significantly higher than those which 
received vehicle (Figure 3D, P = .001). Given that admin-
istration of melatonin in drinking water was as effective, 
but less problematic than the oral gavage route, melatonin 
was administered in drinking water for the remainder of the 
 
behavioural studies.
When melatonin was given as an intervention to rats 
with established paclitaxel- 
induced mechanical hypersen-
sitivity, there was no difference between AUC withdrawal 
threshold (day 20- 
30) values of groups receiving melatonin 
or vehicle control (Figure 4). Additionally, both were sig-
nificantly lower than AUC values of the group receiving 
paclitaxel and melatonin throughout (P < .01), suggesting 
melatonin was not an effective intervention to the estab-
lished phenotype. However, when melatonin treatment 
was started before paclitaxel and then stopped once the 
hypersensitivity phenotype was apparent, AUC (day 20- 
30) analysis indicated that withdrawal thresholds remained 
higher than rats receiving paclitaxel without melatonin 
(P < .0001) and were indistinguishable from those given 
FIGURE 2

tonin administration had a preventative effect that persisted 
beyond the cessation of treatment.
3.2.3 | Peripheral nerve 8- 
isoprostane 
F2α levels
8- 
isoprostane F2α levels were measured ex vivo in sci-
atic and saphenous nerve tissue collected at the peak of the 
model and normalized to sample protein content. Increased 
8- 
isoprostane F2α levels were found in peripheral nerve 
tissue from paclitaxel- 
treated rats (Figure 5A, P = .003). 
Melatonin treatment was found to significantly reduce the 
elevated 8- 
isoprostane F2α levels in paclitaxel- 
treated rats 
(Figure 5B, P = .0015).
3.2.4 | C-fibre activity- 
dependent slowing
Treatment with paclitaxel with and without melatonin had 
no effect on C-fibre threshold stimulus intensity, amplitude, 
average conduction velocity or initial response width, indica-
tive of the initial range of conduction velocities within the 
C-fibre population (Table 1).
Repetitive stimulation of isolated dorsal roots produced 
a progressive increase in C-fibre response width (Figure 6A 
and B). AUC analysis confirmed that this C-fibre ADS was 
frequency- 
dependent, with stimulation at 2 Hz producing 
greater ADS than at 1 Hz (P < .0001, Figure 6C). C-fibre 
ADS was lower in rats treated with paclitaxel (P < .001), an 
effect that was prevented by melatonin (P < .0001), indepen-
dent of stimulation frequency.
3.2.5 | Combination treatment 
with duloxetine
Paclitaxel produced mechanical hypersensitivity in male and 
female animals that was significantly ameliorated by mela-
tonin administered in drinking water in both sexes (Figure 7). 
Duloxetine limited mechanical hypersensitivity to an ex-
tent comparable with melatonin in both sexes (Figure 7).

Co- 
treatment of paclitaxel- 
treated animals with melatonin in 
drinking water plus duloxetine injections revealed a clear ad-
ditive effect, with higher withdrawal thresholds in co- 
treated 
animals compared to those given either melatonin (males 
P < .05) or duloxetine alone (males P < .0001; females

DISCUSSION
We have shown that in vitro, paclitaxel treatment caused 
mitochondrial dysfunction in DRG cells, with reduced 
membrane potential and metabolic activity, and evidence 
of mitochondrial swelling. However, when the cells were 
treated with paclitaxel plus melatonin, mitochondrial dam-
age was attenuated. Importantly, co- 
treatment of breast or 
ovarian cancer cells with melatonin had no impact on the cy-
totoxicity of paclitaxel. In a rat model of paclitaxel- 
induced 
neuropathic pain, we found that oral melatonin pretreatment 
was protective, whether given as a bolus or in drinking water. 
Furthermore, melatonin reduced paclitaxel- 
elevated periph-
eral nerve 8- 
isoprostane F2α levels and prevented paclitaxel 
reduced C-fibre ADS. When given in a prophylactic manner, 
melatonin significantly attenuated paclitaxel- 
evoked me-
chanical hypersensitivity in both male and female animals, 
and there was an additive affect when melatonin was given 
along with duloxetine. Melatonin treatment was well toler-
ated with no effects on animals’ weight gain, general well- 
being and sedation levels. This work suggests that melatonin 
may be a useful preventive treatment for chemotherapy- 
induced painful neuropathy in patients.
Melatonin is known to be an effective antioxidant, 
and many of its reaction products and metabolites (e.g. 
6- 
hydroxymelatonin) also possess antioxidant activity.15,16 
Melatonin is able to cross cell membranes and is reported 
to concentrate particularly inside mitochondria,35 where it 
may potentially interact with mitochondrial MT1 recep-
tors to modulate mitochondrial function.36,37 Mitochondrial 
damage caused by paclitaxel has been reported previously 
in several cell types5,38-40 including peripheral nerve cells.6 
Our in vitro data show that paclitaxel caused a loss of mi-
tochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity in 
DRG cells, as previously reported13 and that melatonin ame-
liorated this damage. MitoTracker™ Green is a marker which 
fluoresces inside mitochondria, regardless of membrane po-
tential and is an indicator of mitochondrial volume, reacting 
with free thiol groups in cysteine residues of mitochondrial 
proteins.19 The increase in observed mitochondrial volume 
could reflect increased number of mitochondria, or mito-
chondrial swelling, the latter of which has been documented 
in peripheral nerve axons from paclitaxel- 
treated rats.6 
Again melatonin prevented this. Moreover, these in vitro

effects were in keeping with findings in vivo, where levels 
of 8- 
isoprostane F2α, an end product of reactions promoted 
in conditions of oxidative stress,30 were increased in periph-
eral nerve tissue isolated from paclitaxel- 
treated animals, an 
effect diminished in paclitaxel- 
treated animals co- 
treated 
with melatonin.
Altered peripheral nerve function in the rat model of 
paclitaxel- 
induced neuropathy has been demonstrated with 
in vivo electrophysiological recordings revealing that ~30% 
of C-fibres display spontaneous activity that is reduced by 
prophylactic treatment with acetyl- 
l- 
carnitine41, which is 
known to limit mitochondrial dysfunction.42 Altered C-fibre 
function can also be characterized, in both preclinical pain 
models43,44 and chronic pain patients,45-48 by measuring the 
phenomenon of C-fibre ADS, which is a progressive slowing 
of nociceptive C-fibre conduction velocity in response to re-
petitive stimulation.33,34 However, to date, this had not been 
addressed for CINP. Here, we demonstrate that in peripheral 
nerve tissue from paclitaxel- 
treated rats, C-fibres had signifi-
cantly lower ADS, an effect that was prevented in those rats 
co- 
treated with melatonin. We have very recently reported 
that C-fibre ADS alters the temporal relay of pain input to the 
spinal cord and that a reduction in ADS, as we have observed 
in the paclitaxel model, facilitates central pain processing, 
and likely contributes to pain hypersensitivity.49
The rat model of paclitaxel- 
induced neuropathy employed 
has been well characterized6,13,24 and features mechanical hy-
persensitivity as indicated by the reduced mechanical thresh-
old of the flexion withdrawal reflex in the present study. 
Melatonin given by oral gavage was both time- 
consuming 
and stressful for the animal exemplified by the loss of 3 ani-
mals after multiple oral gavages. Attempts to give melatonin 
to individual rats in jelly cubes were unsuccessful, and so we 
administered the melatonin in drinking water as described pre-
viously.50,51 There was no effect of melatonin on water con-
sumption, weight gain and no apparent sedative effect given 
there was no change in righting reflex activity, food or water 
intake, nor indeed altered mechanical sensitivity in animals 
given melatonin alone. Furthermore, when melatonin was 
discontinued, the reduction in mechanical hypersensitivity 
persisted and when given as an intervention in animals when 
CINP was established, melatonin did not limit mechanical hy-
persensitivity, effects inconsistent with a melatonin “sedative” 
effect accounting for the attenuation of CINP. Significantly 
higher serum melatonin levels at the end of the study were 
seen in animals given melatonin compared to those which did 
not and the magnitude of the melatonin protective effect was 
similar for rats given melatonin by bolus doses or in drink-
ing water. We therefore conclude that oral melatonin pretreat-
ment, either as a bolus dose or in drinking water was effective 
at reducing paclitaxel- 
induced mechanical hypersensitivity. 
During these experiments, a melatonin dose of 10 mg/kg per 
day was used. This dose has been demonstrated to be effec-
tive in reducing oxidative stress and symptom severity in pre-
clinical models of a number of diseases, including epilepsy, 
diabetes, ethanol- 
induced neurotoxicity and oxidative lung 
toxicity.52-55
The capacity of melatonin to protect against the devel-
opment of paclitaxel- 
induced mechanical hypersensitivity is 
most likely due to its antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress 
occurs in peripheral nerves in the paclitaxel rat model56, and 
other antioxidant strategies, including spin trap agents9, mi-
tochondrial electron transport chain modulators10 and the 
antioxidant MitoVitE13 reduce symptoms in this model. In 
support, we demonstrate that melatonin limits paclitaxel- 
induced elevation of 8- 
isoprostane F2α levels in peripheral 
nerves in vivo. Therefore, although melatonin may influence 
pain processing via its MT1/MT2 membrane receptors and 
effects on neurotransmitter systems57, the protective effect 
we observe may be more likely to be due to its antioxidant ac-
tion, perhaps via mitochondrial MT1 receptors36,37 as firstly 
melatonin prevented but did not reverse established mechan-
ical hypersensitivity; secondly, the reduction in mechanical 
hypersensitivity produced by daily bolus administration was

stable over 24 hours yet serum melatonin levels peak at 1 h 
and return to baseline by 24 hours. Interestingly, this anti-
oxidant protective effect fits well with the demonstration 
that reactive oxygen species levels peak in the DRG during 
the onset rather than the peak of the paclitaxel model,56 al-
though it has been demonstrated that antioxidant strategies 
can reduce established paclitaxel- 
induced hypersensitiv-
ity.9,10 Furthermore, the recent demonstration that melatonin 
limits oxaliplatin- 
induced mitochondrial dysfunction and 
peripheral neuropathy58 suggests that melatonin is a poten-
tial disease- 
modifying treatment for CINP. However, it could 
also be that melatonin antioxidant capacity combines with 
its receptor- 
mediated effects upon pain processing to col-
lectively provide the reduction in hypersensitivity observed. 
Of interest, given the observed additive effect of melatonin 
and duloxetine, agomelatine, a new class of antidepres-
sant and a melatonergic and serotonergic receptor agonist, 
with evidence of antioxidant activity59,60, has very recently 
been shown to be effective against chemotherapy- 
induced 
neuropathy.61
We also found that melatonin did not inhibit the cytotoxic 
action of paclitaxel in 2 relevant cancer cell lines, in agreement 
with studies using other antioxidants.13,62 Treatment of cancer 
patients with melatonin in several small studies did not impact 
on the effectiveness of chemotherapy63-65, and a meta- 
analysis 
of 10 randomized controlled trials of over 600 patients with 
advanced solid tumours reported that melatonin treatment 
reduced the risk of death at 1 year.66 Another recent meta- 
analysis of 8 trials and 700 patients similarly reported that ad-
juvant melatonin treatment in patients with cancer resulted in 
improved 1- 
year survival.67 A more recent small trial showed 
no difference in survival of patients with non- 
small- 
cell lung 
cancer who received 10 or 20 mg melatonin daily for 6 months, 
although after 22 months, only patients given melatonin had 
survived, with more patients surviving who received 20 mg 
than had received 10 mg.68 Other studies report mechanisms

of how melatonin may potentiate chemotherapy, reduce meta-
static progression and prevent resistance to chemotherapy.69-72 
Moreover, the ability of gliomas to synthesize melatonin nega-
tively correlates with tumour malignancy.73 Melatonin appears 
to be without side effects, other than mild drowsiness,17,74 and 
has been administered to thousands of patients without toxic 
effects, even at high doses, for a variety of conditions.
Our study clearly shows the potential of melatonin as a 
preventative therapeutic intervention for patients undergoing 
chemotherapy, to limit development of neuropathic pain, with 
no obvious risk to the efficacy of chemotherapy or outcome.
