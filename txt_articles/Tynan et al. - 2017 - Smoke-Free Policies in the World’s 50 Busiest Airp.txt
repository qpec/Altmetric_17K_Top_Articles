Smoke-Free Policies in the World’s 50 Busiest Airports — August 2017
Michael A. Tynan1; Elizabeth Reimels JD1; Jennifer Tucker MPA1; Brian A. King PhD1
Exposure to secondhand smoke from burning tobacco prod-
ucts causes premature death and disease, including coronary 
heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer among nonsmoking 
adults and sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory 
infections, middle ear disease, exacerbated asthma, respiratory 
symptoms, and decreased lung function in children (1,2). 
The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that there is no 
risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke (1). Previous 
CDC reports on airport smoke-free policies found that most 
large-hub airports in the United States prohibit smoking (3); 
however, the extent of smoke-free policies at airports globally 
has not been assessed. CDC assessed smoke-free policies at the 
world’s 50 busiest airports (airports with the highest number of 
passengers traveling through an airport in a year) as of August 
2017; approximately 2.7 billion travelers pass through these 
50 airports each year (4). Among these airports, 23 (46%) 
completely prohibit smoking indoors, including five of the 10 
busiest airports. The remaining 27 airports continue to allow 
smoking in designated smoking areas. Designated or venti-
lated smoking areas can cause involuntary secondhand smoke 
exposure among nonsmoking travelers and airport employees. 
Smoke-free policies at the national, city, or airport authority 
levels can protect employees and travelers from secondhand 
smoke inside airports.
The 50 busiest airports were identified using data from the 
Airport International Council, which lists airports based on 
total passenger traffic for 2016 (4). The Airport International 
Council defines passenger traffic as the sum of enplaned pas-
sengers, deplaned passengers, and direct-transit passengers. 
To determine the extent of smoke-free policies at each of the 
50 busiest airports worldwide, CDC reviewed and analyzed 
public information available on airport websites regarding 
availability of designated indoor smoking rooms at airports as 
of August 2017. Results were confirmed with information on 
smoke-free airports maintained by Americans for Nonsmokers’ 
Rights Foundation* and with other Internet resources, includ-
ing information intended to assist smokers in finding places 
where smoking is permitted in airports. In a limited number 
of instances where airport websites contained unclear or 
ambiguous statements about policies, additional information 
was collected from other sources, including airport personnel 
and local public health personnel.
Airports were considered to have a smoke-free policy if they 
completely prohibit smoking in all indoor areas. Airports 
were considered to have no smoke-free policy if they allowed 
smoking in any indoor areas, including designated or venti-
lated indoor smoking areas. Designated smoking areas can 
include, but are not limited to, rooms designed for smoking 
tobacco; areas or rooms of restaurants or bars where smoking 
is allowed; and designated areas and rooms in airline clubs 
where smoking is allowed. Policy status was assessed overall 
and by global region.

Among the 50 busiest airports worldwide, 23 (46%) had a 
smoke-free policy (Table 1). Among the top 10 busiest airports, 
five had a smoke-free policy (Beijing Capital, Chicago’s O’Hare 
International, London’s Heathrow, Los Angeles International, 
and Shanghai Pudong International) and five allowed smok-
ing in certain indoor areas (Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson 
International, Dubai International, Hong Kong International, 
Paris’s Charles de Gaulle, and Tokyo International).
Regional differences were observed in smoke-free policy 
status among the world’s 50 busiest airports (Table 2). Among 
those in North America, 14 of 18 had a smoke-free policy; in 
Europe, four of nine had a smoke-free policy, including airports 
in Madrid, Barcelona, and London (Heathrow and Gatwick 
airports); and in Asia, four of 22 had a smoke-free policy (all 
four are in China, including Beijing Capital International 
Airport, the world’s second busiest airport). The only airport 
among the 50 busiest in Oceania is Sydney International, 
which is smoke-free. None of the world’s 50 busiest airports 
is located in South America or Africa.
Discussion
As of August 2017, nearly half (46%) of the 50 busiest air-
ports worldwide have a smoke-free policy. Smoke-free policies 
substantially improve indoor air quality and reduce secondhand 
smoke exposure among nonsmokers (1,2). The 2006 Surgeon 
General’s report concluded that eliminating smoking in indoor 
spaces fully protects nonsmokers from exposure to secondhand 
smoke, and that separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning 
the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposure of 
nonsmokers to secondhand smoke (1).
Although the airports in this analysis that do not have 
smoke-free policies only allow smoking indoors in designated 
or ventilated smoking areas, studies have documented that 
secondhand smoke can transfer from designated smoking 
areas into nonsmoking areas in airports, where nonsmoking 
travelers and employees can be exposed (5–7). In addition to 
subjecting nonsmoking travelers who pass through these areas 
to involuntary secondhand smoke exposure, designated or 
ventilated smoking areas can also result in involuntary exposure 
of airport employees who are required to enter these areas or 
work near them. 
Since 2012, two of the five large-hub U.S. airports that 
allowed smoking in designated indoor areas have implemented, 
or are implementing, smoke-free policies. Salt Lake City 
International, a large-hub U.S. airport that is not among the 
world’s 50 busiest, closed its smoking rooms,† and Denver 
International closed three of its four indoor smoking rooms, 
with the final smoking room scheduled to close by 2018.§
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, information on smoke-free policies was 
based on information available on airport websites, which 
could be subject to bias or be outdated. However, these data

were cross-checked with secondary information sources, and 
questions about unclear information were resolved by con-
tacting local public health and airport personnel. Second, it 
was not possible to identify the types of smoking areas that 
were allowed in all airports (e.g., rooms used exclusively for 
smoking, smoking sections in restaurants and bars, rooms or 
areas in airline clubs, etc.), nor was it possible to ascertain 
passenger or employee movement through airports, which 
might or might not include use of or proximity to areas where 
smoking is permitted. In addition, because it was not possible 
to identify smoke-free policies in outdoor areas or areas near 
exits, this information was not reported. Finally, only the 50 
busiest airports were included in this study; therefore, regions 
such as South America and Africa were not represented in the 
study because they did not include any of these busiest airports. 
However, many airports with lower passenger volume have 
implemented smoke-free policies (8).
Progress has been made in protecting nonsmoking passengers 
and employees from secondhand smoke in airports. A majority 
of airports are smoke-free in many countries worldwide, includ-
ing Australia and New Zealand; European countries such as 
Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom; 
South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
Ecuador, and Uruguay; and North American countries such 
as Canada and the United States.¶ Smoke-free policies at the 
national, city, or airport authority levels can protect employees 
and travelers from secondhand smoke inside airports.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. 
Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects nonsmokers 
from exposure to secondhand smoke. An overwhelming 
majority of large-hub airports in the United States prohibit 
smoking indoors.
What is added by this report?
Among the 50 busiest airports worldwide, 23 airports (46%), 
including five of the 10 busiest airports, prohibit smoking in all 
indoor areas. While smoke-free airports among the 50 busiest 
are common in North America (14 of 18), few airports in Asia 
(4 of 22) have implemented smoke-free polices.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Broader implementation of smoke-free policies at the national, 
city, or airport authority levels can protect employees and 
travelers of all ages from secondhand smoke inside airports.
