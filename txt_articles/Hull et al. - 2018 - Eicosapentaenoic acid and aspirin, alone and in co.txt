Summary
Background The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and aspirin both have proof of 
concept for colorectal cancer chemoprevention, aligned with an excellent safety profile. Therefore, we aimed to test 
the efficacy of EPA and aspirin, alone and in combination and compared with a placebo, in individuals with sporadic 
colorectal neoplasia detected at colonoscopy.
Methods In a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial trial, patients aged 55–73 years 
who were identified during colonoscopy as being at high risk in the English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme 
(BCSP; ≥3 adenomas if at least one was ≥10 mm in diameter or ≥5 adenomas if these were <10 mm in diameter) were 
recruited from 53 BCSP endoscopy units in England, UK. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1:1) using a secure 
web-based server to receive 2 g EPA-free fatty acid (FFA) per day (either as the FFA or triglyceride), 300 mg aspirin per 
day, both treatments in combination, or placebo for 12 months using random permuted blocks of randomly varying 
size, and stratified by BCSP site. Research staff and participants were masked to group assignment. The primary 
endpoint was the adenoma detection rate (ADR; the proportion of participants with any adenoma) at 1 year surveillance 
colonoscopy analysed in all participants with observable follow-up data using a so-called at-the-margins approach, 
adjusted for BCSP site and repeat endoscopy at baseline. The safety population included all participants who received 
at least one dose of study drug. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials 
Number registry, number ISRCTN05926847.
Findings Between Nov 11, 2011, and June 10, 2016, 709 participants were randomly assigned to four treatment groups 
(176 to placebo, 179 to EPA, 177 to aspirin, and 177 to EPA plus aspirin). Adenoma outcome data were available for 
163 (93%) patients in the placebo group, 153 (85%) in the EPA group, 163 (92%) in the aspirin group, and 161 (91%) in 
the EPA plus aspirin group. The ADR was 61% (100 of 163) in the placebo group, 63% (97 of 153) in the EPA group, 
61% (100 of 163) in the aspirin group, and 61% (98 of 161) in the EPA plus aspirin group, with no evidence of any 
effect for EPA (risk ratio [RR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·87 to 1·12; risk difference –0·9%, –8·8 to 6·9; p=0·81) or aspirin 
(RR 0·99 (0·87 to 1·12; risk difference –0·6%, –8·5 to 7·2; p=0·88). EPA and aspirin were well tolerated (78 [44%] of 
176 had ≥1 adverse event in the placebo group compared with 82 [46%] in the EPA group, 68 [39%] in the aspirin 
group, and 76 [45%] in the EPA plus aspirin group), although the number of gastrointestinal adverse events was 
increased in the EPA alone group at 146 events (compared with 85 in the placebo group, 86 in the aspirin group, and 
68 in the aspirin plus placebo group). Six upper-gastrointestinal bleeding events were reported across the treatment 
groups (two in the EPA group, three in the aspirin group, and one in the placebo group).
Interpretation Neither EPA nor aspirin treatment were associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with 
at least one colorectal adenoma. Further research is needed regarding the effect on colorectal adenoma number 
according to adenoma type and location. Optimal use of EPA and aspirin might need a precision medicine approach 
to adenoma recurrence.

Introduction
Despite substantial advances in diagnosis and treatment, 
colorectal cancer remains the second most common 
cause of cancer death in the UK, causing 16 000 deaths in 
2014, with an estimated 1·4 million cases diagnosed 
worldwide in 2012.1
One strategy to reduce colorectal cancer incidence and 
mortality is prevention. Prevention measures include

population screening (by faecal occult blood testing or 
lower gastrointestinal endoscopy) and endoscopic 
surveil 
lance of high-risk groups.2 However, only 10% of 
colo 
rectal cancers in the UK are diagnosed within screen-
 
ing pro 
grammes.3 Moreover, post-colonoscopy colorectal 
can 
cers still occur in patients undergoing screening and 
sur 
veillance, particularly right-sided (proximal) colon 
cancer.4 Therefore, an unmet clinical need for safe and 
effective colorectal cancer chemoprevention (the use of 
drugs or nutritional agents) remains, either as a primary 
measure or in combination with existing surveillance 
programmes.
Colorectal cancer develops over a period of years via a 
benign lesion termed the colorectal adenoma (also known 
as a polyp),5 which represents a biomarker of subsequent 
colorectal cancer risk, but is also a clinically import-
ant lesion per se, the removal of which by endoscopic poly-
pectomy reduces future colorectal cancer risk.6 In parallel 
with the emergence of a stratified medicine approach to 
colorectal cancer treatment based on molecular profiling,7 
the complexity of the early stages of colorectal carcino-
genesis is now recognised. This complexity is reflected by 
two main histological types of precursor lesion (the 
conventional adenoma and ser 
rated adenoma, which is 
now termed sessile serrated lesion, recognising that no 
dysplasia is present in most serrated polyps),8 which map 
differently against molecular char 
acteristics including 
chromosomal instability, micro 
satellite instability, and 
CpG island DNA hypermethylation (CIMP).9
The naturally occurring omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
acid (PUFA) C20:5n3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is 
licensed for treatment of severe hypertriglycerid 
aemia 
that is unresponsive to other therapies and has clinical 
proof-of-concept as a colorectal cancer chemo 
prevention 
agent from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in 
patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, in which 
2 g EPA free fatty acid (FFA) per day for 6 months was 
associated with a significant reduction in rectal adenoma 
number and size.10 Omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to 
have an excellent safety and tolerability profile on the 
basis of vast cardiology experience.11
A robust body of evidence exists from polyp prevention 
RCTs in individuals undergoing colonoscopic surveil-
lance after colorectal adenoma clearance,12 as well as 
long-term follow-up of colorectal cancer outcomes after 
aspirin RCTs with vascular endpoints, that aspirin 
prevents colorectal cancer.13 However, aspirin has not 
been adopted for sporadic colorectal cancer chemo-
prevention to date, because of uncertainty about dose 
and the most appropriate target population balancing 
colorectal cancer risk and adverse event (ie, bleeding) 
profile.14
The National Health Service (NHS) Bowel Cancer 
Screening Programme (BCSP) in England provides 
population-level colorectal cancer screening using guaiac 
faecal occult blood testing, high quality-assured screening 
colonoscopy, and surveillance on the basis of colorectal 
adenoma number and characteristics,2 thus pro 
vid 
ing an 
excellent opportunity for an RCT of chemoprevention in 
individuals at high risk of future colorectal neoplasia.
Colorectal adenoma risk reduction has previously 
been shown at 1 year in polyp prevention RCTs of 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published in English between 
Jan 1, 1990, and Jan 1, 2011, using the terms “colorectal 
cancer”, “colorectal adenoma”, “chemoprevention”, “omega-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acid”, “aspirin”, and “clinical trial”. 
We found one small randomised trial of eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA) for colorectal cancer chemoprevention in familial 
adenomatous polyposis and four randomised sporadic 
polyp prevention trials of aspirin, which used varying doses in 
different risk populations.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial of EPA for 
sporadic colorectal cancer chemoprevention and the first 
evaluation of aspirin in a high-risk population within a high 
quality-assured national bowel cancer screening programme.
EPA and aspirin did not reduce the proportion of individuals 
with any colorectal adenoma (adenoma detection rate [ADR]), 
but they both decreased the recurrence of some subtypes of 
adenoma, measured by adenoma number, 1 year after 
clearance screening colonoscopy. There was evidence of 
selectivity for adenoma type and location.
Implications of all the available evidence
Although our trial found no effect on the primary outcome of 
the proportion of patients with at least one adenoma, both EPA 
and aspirin show some chemoprevention efficacy for colorectal 
cancer. The larger effect size of aspirin adds to the weight of 
evidence for its use in combination with endoscopic screening 
and surveillance, which provides suboptimal protection against 
right-sided colorectal cancer.
Our findings suggest that a precision medicine approach 
(for adenoma type and location) to colorectal cancer 
chemoprevention will be necessary, which mirrors best 
practice in colorectal cancer treatment based on molecular 
stratification.
The trial raises the crucial question of whether ADR or 
adenoma number is the best measure of chemoprevention 
efficacy in polyp prevention trials that are based on 
quality-assured colonoscopy in individuals at high risk of 
colorectal cancer, in which the ADR is used as a performance 
indicator, and the adenoma recurrence rate is high.

aspirin and metformin.12,15,16 Therefore, we aimed to test 
the chemo 
prevention efficacy of EPA and aspirin, alone 
and in combination, in individuals with high-risk 
colorectal adenoma features at screening colonoscopy, 
who sub 
sequently had a surveillance colonoscopy at 
1 year, in the BCSP.
Methods
Study design and participants
The Systematic Evaluation of Aspirin and Fish Oil 
(seAFOod) Polyp Prevention Trial was a multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 facto-
r 
ial trial. The trial protocol has been published elsewhere.17 
Approval was obtained from the Trent Research Ethics 
Committee (10/H0405/90). The seAFOod trial was done 
in 53 hospital endoscopy units in the English BCSP using 
its strict protocol-driven and quality-assured practice and 
reporting mechanisms.2 The trial gained approval from 
the English BCSP Research Committee.
Individuals aged 55–73 years who were identified as 
high risk at a complete BCSP screening colonos 
copy 
(three or more colorectal adenomas with at least 
one ≥10 mm in diameter, or five or more colorectal 
adenomas that were <10 mm in diameter) were screened 
for trial eligibility. For participants who had a bowel 
scope flexible sigmoidoscopy in the BCSP, eligibility was 
established on the basis of combined colorectal adenoma 
findings from the flexible sigmoidoscopy and subsequent 
colonoscopy.
All individuals at high risk were provided with written 
trial information after colonoscopy and then attended 
a routine BCSP outpatient visit 7–14 days later, dur-
ing which written informed consent was obtained if 
they were eligible. Exclusion criteria included require-
ment for more than one repeat colonoscopy or flexible 
sigmoidoscopy within the 3 month BCSP screening 
window, regular (>3 doses per week) prescribed or over-
the-counter (OTC) aspirin or non-aspirin non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and concomitant 
warfarin therapy or use of any other anticoagulant or 
antiplatelet agent.17 A complete list of all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria can be found in the protocol summary 
on the International Standard Randomised Controlled 
Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
either EPA plus aspirin; EPA plus placebo; aspirin plus 
placebo; or placebo plus placebo. Randomisation 
occurred within 4 weeks from the screening colonoscopy 
by research staff at each site using a secure web-based 
system with treatment assignment established by a 
pseudorandom code, using random permuted blocks of 
randomly varying size. Stratification was done by BCSP 
site.
The sequence of treatment allocations was concealed 
until recruitment, data collection, and database lock 
were completed. Investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
allocation was not divulged to any research staff or 
participant.
Procedures
Participants who were randomly assigned to receive EPA 
received either 2 g 99% EPA-FFA per day (as two 500 mg 
gastro-resistant capsules taken twice per day with food, 
supplied by SLA Pharma AG, Liestal, Switzerland), as used 
in the previous RCT in patients with familial adenomatous 
polyposis,10 or an equivalent FFA dose as 2780 mg 
90% EPA-triglyceride per day (as five soft gelatine capsules 
per day split between two meals, purchased from Igennus 
Healthcare Nutrition, Cambridge, UK; appendix). Those 
assigned to receive a placebo of EPA received the 
respective identical-looking capsules (both containing 
mixed capric and capryllic acid medium-chain triglycer-
ides). Participants also received either one 300 mg 
enteric-coated aspirin tablet per day with food or an 
identical placebo tablet (both supplied by Bayer AG, 
Leverkusen, Germany). Capsule and tablet were taken 
until the day before surveillance (exit) colonoscopy, which 
was scheduled 12 months after screening. Dur-
ing the intervention phase, SLA Pharma were unable to 
supply sufficient EPA-FFA capsules, which resulted in a 
switch to the EPA-triglyceride formulation (appendix). 
Each participant received only one formulation of EPA 
(either FFA or triglyceride) or its matching placebo.
Participants could withdraw from the trial at any time. 
When a participant withdrew from the intervention only, 
follow-up occurred per protocol. If a participant withdrew 
from the trial, data collected up to the point of withdrawal 
were included in the analyses.
Participants 
completed 
a 
European 
Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition short food 
frequency questionnaire at study entry and after sur-
veillance colonoscopy at 12 months, for categorisation of 
total and oily fish intake (appendix). A prescription was 
issued for the supply of the IMP by the local hospital 
pharmacy at randomisation and at clinical review at 
6 months. Blood (for plasma, red blood cells, and 
leucocytes) and urine samples were obtained at study 
entry, at 6 months, and at surveillance colonoscopy. 
Rectal mucosa (four biopsy samples of macroscopically 
normal mucosa ≤2 cm from any polyp) was collected at 
the end of the surveillance colonoscopy.17 Telephone 
consultations were done at 2 weeks, 12 weeks, and 
38 weeks after randomisation to monitor for adverse 
events (with emphasis on emergent gastrointestinal 
symptoms), check concomitant medication use, and 
confirm IMP compliance. Participants scheduled for 
repeat lower gastrointestinal endoscopy stopped the IMP 
10 days before and restarted IMP 4 days after to minimise 
potential bleeding risk.
Fatty acids were extracted from red blood cell mem-
branes and rectal mucosa and then measured by liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as previously

fatty acid relative to the total fatty acid chromatographic 
peak area.18
Colorectal adenoma outcomes at the 12 month 
surveillance colonoscopy were collected as per routine 
BCSP practice,2,19 including the number, size (maxi-
mum dimension in millimetres as indicated on the 
histopathology report or the endo 
scopic size if the 
adenoma was not retrieved or was removed by hot 
biopsy), site (proximal to the splenic flexure [right] or 
distal to the splenic flexure [left]), histological type 
(tubular or tubulovillous, villous, or serrated—not 
including hyperplastic polyps]), and presence of high-
grade dysplasia for all colorectal adenomas.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the proportion of participants 
with one or more colorectal adenomas detected at 
surveillance colonoscopy—ie, the adenoma detection 
rate (ADR; centrally assessed). The secondary outcomes 
were as follows: the proportion of participants with 
advanced (≥10 mm diameter, high-grade dysplasia, or 
villous histology) colorectal adenomas and with 
conventional (this term encompassing tubular, tubulo-
villous, and villous adenomas was adopted only after 
database lock), serrated, left-sided, and right-sided 
colorectal adenoma subtypes (serrated adenoma was 
added as a secondary endpoint to the SAP before database 
lock); the mean number of colorectal adenomas per 
participant for all colorectal adenomas, and for advanced, 
conventional, serrated, left-sided, and right-sided colo-
rectal adenoma subtypes; the number of participants at 
high risk who were reclassified as being at intermediate 
risk (BCSP guidelines mandate that any individual who 
does not continue to fulfil high-risk criteria should be 
classified as being at intermediate risk for 3-year sur-
veillance colonoscopy); development of colorectal cancer; 
dietary fish and other seafood intake at baseline and at 
12 months; red blood cell and rectal mucosal PUFA 
concentrations; and adverse events, including clinically 
signifi 
cant bleeding episodes (haemorrhagic stroke or 
gastro 
intestinal bleeding).17 Post-hoc exploratory analyses 
were done on colorectal adenoma size, the relationship 
be 
tween individual rectal mucosal EPA levels and 
colorectal adenoma number, and the association between 
rectal mucosal and red blood cell EPA levels at 12 months. 
The analysis of colorectal adenoma size was based on 
the within-participant mean colorectal adenoma size and 
was adjusted for histological subtype (con 
ventional 
or serrated) and BCSP site. A full list of all endpoints can 
be found in the protocol summary on the ISRCTN 
registry.
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 768 evaluable individuals defined 
as high risk by BCSP allowed detection of a mini-
mum 18% relative (10% absolute) reduction in ADR 
from 60% for both agents within a 2 × 2 factorial 
design, assuming independent intervention effects, with 
80% power and a 5% two-sided significance level, as 
described in the protocol.17 This effect size was less than 
that observed in the previous RCT of EPA-FFA in patients 
with familial adenomatous polyposis,10 and lower than 
the relative ADR reduction in the meta-analysis of aspirin

population of all participants who were randomly 
assigned and who received at least one dose of IMP.
The primary outcome was analysed with a so-called at-
the-margins approach,20 after first examining whether 
there was any evidence of an interaction between EPA 
and aspirin. The log relative risk was estimated using a 
mixed effects log-binomial regression model, with BCSP 
site as a random effect and the risk difference and ratio 
presented with the 95% CI. Both interventions were 
fitted simultaneously and the analysis was adjusted 
according to whether a repeat endoscopic screening 
procedure was required and according to BCSP site. 
Sensitivity analyses were done to support the primary 
analysis. All secondary analyses assumed that data were 
missing at random and no imputation was done. Data 
are presented as the risk difference for the binary 
ADR outcomes and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for 
continuous data (ie, the mean number of adenomas per 
participant).
Treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse 
drug reactions were summarised by MedDRA system 
organ class. Gastrointestinal adverse events were also 
summarised by MedDRA preferred term and EPA 
formulation (FFA or triglyceride). The worst case (severe 
event or event related to trial treatment) was assumed if 
severity or causality data were missing. Clinically 
significant bleeding episodes (haemorrhagic stroke or 
acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding re 
quiring hospital 
admission or investigation) were identi 
fied by the chief 
investigator (MAH) using a manual search of all adverse 
events. Common gastrointestinal adverse events were 
presented separately as clinically meaningful symptom 
categories, as defined by the chief investigator.
The statistical analysis plan was finalised before 
database lock on Aug 31, 2017
. The plan included 
comparison of the EPA formula 
tions (safety and 
tolerability, as well as EPA incorporation), analysis of 
serrated adenoma outcomes, and de 
finition of the analysis 
population to include only participants with observed 
follow-up data, compared with the analysis described in 
the protocol.17 Extra sensitivity analyses of the pri-
mary outcome (BCSP centre and site as random effects 
in a multilevel model, without adjustment for repeat 
endoscopy, baseline red blood cell EPA levels, and oily fish 
intake), conventional colorectal adenoma outcomes, and 
the aforementioned exploratory analyses were later added.
All statistical analyses were done using Stata 
version 15.0. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN 
registry, number ISRCTN05926847
.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Patients were recruited between Nov 11, 2011, and 
June 10, 2016 (mandated by the maximum shelf life of 
EPA-triglyceride specified by the Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency; appendix). 
During this period, 3911 individuals who were defined as 
high risk by the BCSP were identified and assessed for 
eligibility, of whom 3202 (82%) were excluded (figure 1). 
Existing aspirin or other NSAID use occurred in 
594 (15%) screened individuals at high risk, and concur-
rent anticoagulant or non-aspirin anti 
platelet agent use 
was an exclusion criterion in 313 (8%) patients. Overall, 
709 (18%) patients were randomly assigned, 176 to 
placebo, 179 to EPA alone, 177 to aspirin alone, and 177 to 
EPA plus aspirin. 641 (90%) patients had a surveillance 
colonoscopy, with colorectal adenoma outcome data 
available 
for 
640 
(90%) 
individuals 
(figure 
1). 
422 (60%) participants were randomly assigned to 
active EPA-FFA or placebo (109 to placebo, 108 to EPA, 
101 to aspirin, and 104 to EPA plus aspirin) and 
287 (40%) participants were randomly assigned to active 
EPA-triglyceride or placebo (67 to placebo, 71 to EPA, 
76 to aspirin, and 73 to EPA plus aspirin).
Baseline characteristics were well balanced across 
the four treatment groups (table 1). The mean age of 
participants was 65 years (IQR 62–69) and 80% were 
men, reflecting the high-risk patient demo 
graphic in the 
English BCSP.17 We noted a slight imbalance across 
groups with respect to smoking status, with fewer 
current smokers present in the EPA treatment group.

A history of abdominal pain or dyspepsia was reported by 
158 (22%) of 707 participants (36 [20%] in the placebo 
group, 40 [22%] in the EPA group, 41 [23%] in the aspirin 
group, and 41 [23%] in the EPA plus aspirin group).
Screening colonoscopy findings were balanced across 
the treatment groups (table 1). Compliance with both 
capsule and tablet IMPs was excellent, with mean com-
pliance percentage as measured by capsule and tablet 
counting being 94–97% (appendix). During the inter-
vention phase, 18 (26%) of 707 participants started other 
regular medication, which was balanced across treatment 
groups (appendix). Dietary fish intake was similar across 
treatment groups (appendix), with no discernible differ-
ence between the groups regarding the proportion of 
people who changed their dietary fish intake during the 
intervention (appendix).
As expected, individuals in the EPA treatment group 
showed an increase in red blood cell and rectal mucosal 
EPA content compared with baseline values, unlike the 
trial groups that did not include active EPA treatment 
(figure 2). Comparison of red blood cell and rectal 
mucosal EPA concentrations during the intervention and 
comparison of the change from baseline values in 
individuals who received active EPA capsules confirmed 
that EPA incorporation during the trial was similar 
between participants who were allocated FFA or 
triglyceride capsules (figure 2; appendix). No evidence of 
conversion from EPA to the other main bioactive long-
chain omega-3 PUFA C22:6n3 docosahexaenoic acid was 
observed, and there was no evidence of a clear reduction 
in tissue C20:4n6 arachidonic acid content, in red blood 
cells or in the rectum (appendix). The ratio of EPA to 
arachidonic acid, which is often reported as a therapeutic 
response biomarker of EPA in cardiovascular trials,11 was 
similar in red blood cells and the rectum of participants 
who received either FFA or triglyceride (appendix).
The median time between randomisation and sur-
veillance colonoscopy was 344–349 days (table 2). The 
primary outcome (total ADR) was similar across the 
four treatment groups (100 [61%] of 163 patients in the 
placebo group vs 97 [63%] of 153 in the EPA group vs 
100 [61%] of 163 in the aspirin group vs 98 [61%] of 161 in 
the EPA plus aspirin group; table 2). There was no 
evidence of an interaction between EPA and aspirin for 
the ADR (interaction risk difference –1·5%, 95% CI 
–17·1 to 14·2, pinteraction=0·8530). Therefore, the ADR was 
analysed accord 
ing to factorial margins (table 3). The risk 
differ 
ence and risk ratio of having at least one colorectal 
adenoma did not differ between EPA and placebo, and it 
also did not differ between aspirin and placebo 
(table 4; appendix). The 95% CI for the risk difference for 
both interventions did not exceed –10% (the absolute 
ADR difference that the trial was powered to detect). An 
analysis that was not adjusted for repeat colonoscopy 
showed similar results (appendix). Multiple sensitivity 
analyses, including per-protocol analysis, were supportive 
of the primary analysis (appendix).

detected at surveillance colonoscopy are shown in

colorectal adenomas were detected in individuals who 
were ran 
domly assigned to combined EPA and aspirin 
treat 
ment than to the other three groups (table 2), 
which was most marked for left-sided lesions. The total 
mean number of colorectal adenomas per participant 
was 1·4 (SD 2·0) in individuals who were allocated 
placebo only, compared with 1·6 (2·1) for those allocated 
EPA and 1·3 (1·6) for those assigned to aspirin. 
Participants assigned to both EPA and aspirin had a 
mean of 1·0 (1·2) adenomas per person (table 2). 
Analysis at the margins revealed an IRR of 0·91 (95% CI 
0·79–1·05) for EPA and 0·78 (95% CI 0·68–0·90) for 
aspirin (table 4).
Secondary ADR outcomes are described in tables 2–4 
and in the appendix. Few advanced colorectal adenomas 
were detected (table 2). IRRs from an at-the-margins 
analysis of the mean number of adenomas per 
participant for colorectal adenoma subtypes showed an 
effect of EPA on left-sided and conventional colorectal 
adenomas, but no evidence of an effect on right-sided 
or serrated lesions was observed (table 3, 4, appendix). 
By contrast, aspirin treatment was associated with a 
statistically significant decrease in the incidence of 
conventional colorectal adenomas, but also a decrease 
in IRR for right-sided and serrated lesions (table 3, 
appendix). In keeping with the primary ADR outcome, 
no evidence of any difference in colorectal adenoma 
subtype ADRs for either EPA or aspirin was observed, 
except for a possible effect of EPA on recurrence of left-
sided colorectal adenomas (table 4; appendix). The 
number of individuals who were reclassified as being 
at intermediate risk requiring a subsequent 3 year 
procedure, rather than continuing annual surveillance, 
was no different across the treatment groups (table 2, 4;

appendix). No colorectal cancers were detected during 
the seAFOod trial.
The safety population comprised 697 participants who 
received at least one dose of IMP (table 5). Overall, there 
were no safety concerns in participants receiving either 
EPA or aspirin (appendix). The majority of adverse 
events were mild in severity in each of the treatment 
groups (table 5). An excess of adverse events was 
observed in participants receiving EPA alone, adverse 
events 
that 
were 
predominantly 
gastrointestinal 
(diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and nausea; appendix) and 
were explained mainly by clustering of numerous 
gastrointestinal adverse events in a small number of 
individuals (table 5). By contrast, the frequency and 
distribution of gastrointestinal adverse events was 
similar across the other three groups, including those 
who received both EPA and aspirin (table 5; appendix). 
No consistent differences in gastro 
intestinal adverse 
events between individuals receiving EPA–FFA or 
EPA–triglyceride were observed (appendix). The same 
pattern was noted for adverse drug reactions (appendix). 
A small number of serious adverse events (SAEs) 
were reported (table 5; appendix). The most frequently 
reported SAEs were cardiac events (including three 
episodes of atrial fibrillation in one participant and one 
atrial fibrillation episode in two participants, all of 
whom were receiving EPA alone) and gastrointestinal 
disorders. No haemorrhagic strokes were reported. 
Six acute upper-gastrointestinal bleeding events were 
reported, and were spread across the treatment groups 
(two in the EPA group, three in the aspirin group, 
and one in the placebo group). One unrelated death in 
the placebo group was reported after 9 months of 
intervention (bladder cancer).
No evidence of a difference in colorectal adenoma size 
associated with either EPA or aspirin use was found 
(appendix).
Finally, the detailed PUFA measurements done to 
compare tissue EPA incorporation during dosing with 
EPA–FFA and EPA–triglyceride provided an opportunity 
to explore the relationship between target organ (rectal) 
EPA incorporation and red blood cell EPA levels 
commonly used as a biomarker of tissue EPA exposure.18 
A moderate strength correlation (r=0·455) between 
red blood cell and rectal mucosal EPA con 
centrations 
was observed at 12 months (appendix). We also did an 
unplanned investigation of the re 
lationship between 
individual rectal mucosal EPA concentration and 
number of colorectal adenomas (total and subtypes) 
descriptively, comparing EPA users and those who 
received placebo EPA (appendix). Both EPA users and 
those who did not use EPA with a higher rectal mucosal 
EPA concentration appeared to have, in general, a lower 
colorectal adenoma count than those with a lower 
rectal mucosal EPA level, which was most marked for 
total colorectal adenoma number and conventional 
adenomas (appendix).
Discussion
The seAFOod Polyp Prevention trial found no evidence 
of an effect of either EPA or aspirin on the primary 
outcome of the proportion of individuals with one or 
more colorectal adenomas at 12 month surveillance 
colonoscopy (the ADR) in patients defined as high risk by 
the English BCSP. However, secondary analyses of the 
effects of EPA and aspirin on colorectal adenoma number 
provided evidence of the chemopreventive activity of 
both agents. Aspirin was effective at reducing the total 
number of colorectal adenomas per participant, but the 
effect of EPA on total number of adenomas per 
participant was insufficiently precise to draw a firm 
conclusion about efficacy. Other secondary analyses 
suggested that EPA and aspirin have colorectal adenoma 
subtype-selective and site-selective effects. Participants 
randomly assigned to receive EPA had a reduced total 
number of and ADR for conventional adenomas in the 
left colorectum than did those in the placebo group. As 
well as a reduction in total colorectal adenoma number, 
participants randomly assigned to receive aspirin had a 
reduced number of adenomas in the right colon, 
particularly for serrated adenomas, but also a reduced 
risk of conventional colorectal adenomas.
The ADR was chosen as the primary outcome because 
previous polyp prevention trials have used this binary

measure of colorectal adenoma occurrence as the 
primary endpoint.12 The high ADR (61%) in the placebo 
group in patients who were high risk so-called polyp 
formers was anticipated,21 but is higher than that 
observed in previous polyp prevention trials that included 
a majority of patients at intermediate risk. Notably, 
previous aspirin RCTs with the highest placebo ADR 
(47·1% and 53·4%) have reported no significant risk 
reduction 
associated 
with 
aspirin,12 
despite 
the 
overwhelming evidence for a colorectal cancer chemo-
prevention effect of aspirin.13 The high ADR in the 
seAFOod trial will also have been driven by uniformly 
excellent colonoscopy quality in the BCSP, in which the 
ADR is a key endoscopist performance indicator.2,22 
Therefore, use of ADR as a chemoprevention biomarker 
in high-risk cohorts with a high ADR, undergoing 
quality-assured colonoscopic assessment, should be 
questioned.
By contrast, previous RCTs in patients with familial 
adenomatous polyposis have reported efficacy on the 
basis of colorectal adenoma number.10 Colorectal 
adenoma number is recognised to predict future 
colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in observational 
studies.23 Re 
duction in colorectal adenoma multiplicity, 
similar to that observed in the seAFOod trial, has been 
reported in all of the three aspirin RCTs that used 
adenoma number as a secondary outcome.16,24,25 The 
observational evidence that aspirin reduces long-term 
colorectal cancer risk,13 combined with a reduction in 
colorectal adenoma number observed in previous polyp 
prevention trials that is similar to that seen in the 
seAFOod trial,12 suggests that the effect sizes for EPA and 
aspirin reported in this Article will translate into a 
clinically meaningful decrease in long-term colorectal 
cancer risk.
More recently, adenoma number has gained credence 
as a primary outcome measure in polyp prevention 
RCTs,15 driven by the increasing quality of colonoscopy 
and use of the mean number of adenomas per participant 
as an outcome in endoscopy quality-assurance studies.22 
Therefore, we suggest that future chemoprevention 
RCTs utilise number of adenomas per participant as the 
primary outcome.
Chemopreventive activity of EPA against conventional 
colorectal adenomas (but not serrated lesions), is 
consistent with the known efficacy of the same dose of 
EPA–FFA in patients with familial adenomatous 
polyposis and rectal adenomas,10 which are conventional, 
dysplastic lesions. The seAFOod trial data concur with 
evidence from long-term follow-up of vascular RCTs that 
show that reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and 
mortality with aspirin is explained by an effect on 
proximal neoplasia, with less preventive efficacy against 
distal colorectal cancer.13 Two observational studies 
already support a beneficial effect of aspirin on serrated 
polyp risk.26,27 The seAFOod trial data should prompt a 
paradigm shift towards stratified chemoprevention trials 
with analysis of colorectal adenoma subtype and tumour 
location outcomes. Differential preventive activity against 
conventional and serrated pathway lesions by EPA and 
aspirin has highlighted the relatively poor characterisation 
of the molecular phenotype of colorectal adenomas 
compared with colorectal cancer,7,9 and the poor under-
standing of the mechanism of action of both agents. 
Subsequent mechanistic studies of EPA and aspirin 
should investigate differential activity in models of 
chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and 
CIMP carcinogenesis pathways.
Total and left-sided colorectal adenoma multiplicity 
was lower in the group receiving combined treatment 
with EPA and aspirin, consistent with efficacy of both 
agents on left-sided, conventional colorectal adenomas. 
A fact 
orial trial design that assumes independent inter-
vention effects can only detect a large interaction between 
EPA and aspirin. A key objective of future work will be to 
apply precision medicine principles to establish which 
individuals might gain most from chemoprevention with 
one or both agents, based on baseline colorectal adenoma 
characteristics alone or together with other mucosal 
biomarkers.9
The seAFOod trial became a unique opportunity to 
compare the tissue bioavailability and tolerability of 
two EPA formulations of the same FFA dose in an RCT. 
There appeared to be no meaningful difference in com-
pliance, tissue EPA incorporation, or tolerability between 
the FFA and triglyceride formulations, contrasting with

many previous short-term studies of different omega-3 
PUFA formulations.28 We confirmed the excellent safety 
profile of EPA and aspirin with an excess of mild-to-
moderate gastrointestinal adverse events in EPA users, 
which is a consistent finding in omega-3 PUFA trials.10,28 
The excess of gastrointestinal symptoms in the group 
treated with EPA alone compared with the group treated 
with EPA and aspirin was unexpected, and requires 
validation and mechanistic explanation in parallel with 
further assessment of combination chemoprevention with 
both EPA and aspirin.
Omega-3 PUFA concentrations in red blood cells were 
similar to data from studies in other countries with 
relatively low dietary fish intake,29 with no evidence that 
trial participation altered dietary omega-3 PUFA intake. 
Despite self-reported compliance being excellent by 
capsule counting, the increase in EPA concentrations in 
red blood cells observed in active EPA users was highly 
variable, a phenomenon which has been seen in previous 
omega-3 PUFA studies.30 Detailed analysis of the relation-
ship between individual baseline omega-3 PUFA 
concentrations, dietary omega-3 PUFA intake, and 
response to EPA dosing versus colorectal adenoma 
number is now required.
No evidence of substantial conversion of EPA to 
docosahexaenoic acid either in red blood cell membranes 
or rectal mucosa was seen. Therefore, the trial data do 
not support EPA as a universal omega-3 PUFA donor in 
the colorectum and no conclusions can be drawn from 
the trial about the efficacy of mixed EPA and 
docosahexaenoic acid formulations, which represent the 
majority of prescription and nutritional supplement 
omega-3 PUFA formulations.
Strengths of the trial include excellent, quality-assured 
colonoscopy performance and histological reporting, and 
uniform, protocol-driven care in the BCSP.2,22 We chose 
to study a high-risk surveillance cohort to reduce study 
duration and costs. We have previously justified the use 
of a 1 year endpoint on the basis of positive findings at 
1 year colonoscopy that mirror longer follow-up in 
previous aspirin polyp prevention trials,12 and evidence 
that colorectal adenoma outcomes after 1 year represent 
de-novo adenoma growth rather than solely missed 
lesions.17 The low number of advanced colorectal 
adenomas detected compared with previous RCTs is a 
limitation and probably relates to the short surveillance 
interval and the completeness of clearance of the 
screening colonoscopy in the BCSP. The male pre-
dominance reflects actual screening practice in the UK, 
as does the high prevalence of excess bodyweight in 
those with high-risk neoplasia.2 The trial only reached 
83% of its recruitment target due primarily to a high 
screening failure, which included a higher-than-expected 
number of individuals who were unwilling to provide 
consent after BCSP screening. This finding has imp-
ortant implications for acceptability of long-term chemo-
prevention, even in high-risk cohorts, which requires 
further behavioural research. However, the reduced 
sample size still yielded sufficient precision to exclude a 
prespecified difference of 10% from placebo in the ADR 
for both EPA and aspirin.
In conclusion, the seAFOod Polyp Prevention trial has 
shown that the omega-3 PUFA EPA (2 g FFA per day) 
and aspirin (300 mg per day) did not reduce colorectal 
adenoma risk (as measured by the proportion of partici-
pants with at least one adenoma) at 1 year surveillance 
colonoscopy in individuals at high risk with colorectal 
neoplasia in the English BCSP. However, both agents 
had some chemopreventive efficacy on colorectal 
adenoma burden, as measured by a reduction in the 
mean number of adenomas per participant. The colo-
rectal adenoma subtype-dependent and location-de-
pendent specificity of EPA and aspirin are consistent 
with previous observations. Existing data on colorectal 
cancer risk reduction by aspirin suggest that the decrease 
in colorectal adenoma recurrence that we report for both 
agents is likely to translate into a clinically meaningful 
decrease in long-term colorectal cancer risk.
