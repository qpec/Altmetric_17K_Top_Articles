Abstract
Problem/Condition: Overall, the prevalence of illness attributable to vaccine-preventable diseases is greater among adults than 
among children. Adults are recommended to receive vaccinations based on their age, underlying medical conditions, lifestyle, prior 
vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. 
Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage among 
U.S. adults is low.
Period Covered: August 2014–June 2015 (for influenza vaccination) and January–December 2015 (for pneumococcal, tetanus 
and diphtheria [Td] and tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, and human 
papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination).
Description of System: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey 
of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability 
sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. The survey objective is to monitor the health of the 
U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors.
Results: Compared with data from the 2014 NHIS, increases in vaccination coverage occurred for influenza vaccine among adults 
aged ≥19 years (a 1.6 percentage point increase compared with the 2013–14 season to 44.8%), pneumococcal vaccine among 
adults aged 19–64 years at increased risk for pneumococcal disease (a 2.8 percentage point increase to 23.0%), Tdap vaccine 
among adults aged ≥19 years and adults aged 19–64 years (a 3.1 percentage point and 3.3 percentage point increase to 23.1% and 
to 24.7%, respectively), herpes zoster vaccine among adults aged ≥60 years and adults aged ≥65 years (a 2.7 percentage point and 
3.2 percentage point increase to 30.6% and to 34.2%, respectively), and hepatitis B vaccine among health care personnel (HCP) 
aged ≥19 years (a 4.1 percentage point increase to 64.7%). Herpes zoster vaccination coverage in 2015 met the Healthy People 2020 
target of 30%. Aside from these modest improvements, vaccination coverage among adults in 2015 was similar to estimates from 
2014. Racial/ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all seven vaccines, with higher coverage generally for whites compared 
with most other groups. Adults without health insurance reported receipt of influenza vaccine (all age groups), pneumococcal 
vaccine (adults aged 19–64 years at increased risk), Td vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years, 19–64 years, and 50–64 years), Tdap vaccine 
(adults aged ≥19 years and 19–64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years overall and among travelers), hepatitis B vaccine 
(adults aged ≥19 years, 19–49 years, and among travelers), 
herpes zoster vaccine (adults aged ≥60 years), and HPV vaccine 
(males and females aged 19–26 years) less often than those with 
health insurance. Adults who reported having a usual place

associations related to respondents’ characteristics (e.g., 
demographic and access to care) (5). This surveillance 
summary updates those vaccination coverage estimates. 
The estimates provided in this report can be used by 
public health practitioners, adult vaccination providers, 
and the general public to understand better the factors that 
contribute to low vaccination rates and modify strategies 
and interventions to improve vaccination coverage.
Methods
To assess vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 
years for selected vaccines and factors associated with 
vaccination, CDC analyzed data from the 2015 National 
Health Interview Survey (NHIS); for influenza coverage, 
data from the 2014 NHIS (for August–December) also were 
used for the 2014 component of the 2014–15 influenza 
season. This report highlights the results of that analysis for 
influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus toxoid-containing (tetanus 
and diphtheria vaccine [Td] or tetanus and diphtheria with 
acellular pertussis vaccine [Tdap]), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, 
herpes zoster (shingles), and human papillomavirus (HPV). 
Introduction
Overall, the prevalence of illness attributable to vaccine-
preventable diseases is greater among adults aged ≥19 years 
than among children aged ≤12 years (1–5) attributable in 
great part to successful childhood vaccination programs. 
The prevalence of vaccine-preventable illnesses among older 
persons is especially high (1–4). Vaccinations are recommended 
throughout a person’s lifetime to prevent vaccine-preventable 
diseases and their sequelae. However, adult vaccination 
coverage remains low for most routinely recommended 
vaccines (5) and below Healthy People 2020 targets (https://
www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/
immunization-and-infectious-diseases). In October 2016, 
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
approved the adult immunization schedule for 2017 (6). 
Influenza vaccination is recommended for all adults each 
year. Other adult vaccinations are recommended for specific 
populations based on a person’s age, health conditions, 
behavioral risk factors (e.g., injection drug use), occupation, 
travel, and other indications (6).
In February 2016, CDC released the first comprehensive 
report of adult vaccination coverage that described 
for health care generally reported receipt of recommended vaccinations more often than those who did not have such a place, 
regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults reporting one or more physician 
contacts in the past year compared with those who had not visited a physician in the past year, regardless of whether they had 
health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and ≥10 physician contacts within the past year, depending on the 
vaccine, 18.2%–85.6% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with 
specific indications. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born adults was higher than that among foreign-born adults, with 
few exceptions (influenza vaccination [adults aged 19–49 years and 50–64 years], hepatitis A vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years], 
and hepatitis B vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years with diabetes or chronic liver conditions]).
Interpretation: Coverage for all vaccines for adults remained low but modest gains occurred in vaccination coverage for influenza 
(adults aged ≥19 years), pneumococcal (adults aged 19–64 years with increased risk), Tdap (adults aged ≥19 years and adults aged 
19–64 years), herpes zoster (adults aged ≥60 years and ≥65 years), and hepatitis B (HCP aged ≥19 years); coverage for other vaccines 
and groups with vaccination indications did not improve. The 30% Healthy People 2020 target for herpes zoster vaccination was 
met. Racial/ethnic disparities persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Missed opportunities to vaccinate remained. 
Although having health insurance coverage and a usual place for health care were associated with higher vaccination coverage, 
these factors alone were not associated with optimal adult vaccination coverage. HPV vaccination coverage for males and females 
has increased since CDC recommended vaccination to prevent cancers caused by HPV, but many adolescents and young adults 
remained unvaccinated.
Public Health Actions: Assessing factors associated with low coverage rates and disparities in vaccination is important for 
implementing strategies to improve vaccination coverage. Evidence-based practices that have been demonstrated to improve 
vaccination coverage should be used. These practices include assessment of patients’ vaccination indications by health care providers 
and routine recommendation and offer of needed vaccines to adults, implementation of reminder-recall systems, use of standing-
order programs for vaccination, and assessment of practice-level vaccination rates with feedback to staff members. For vaccination 
coverage to be improved among those who reported lower coverage rates of recommended adult vaccines, efforts also are needed 
to identify adults who do not have a regular provider or insurance and who report fewer health care visits.

Data are reported by selected demographic and access-to-
care characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, indication for 
vaccination, health insurance status, contacts with physicians, 
nativity, and citizenship). Other estimates of influenza 
vaccination coverage using data from 2015–16 and earlier 
seasons from other sources have been published (7–9). These 
data sources have been described previously (10). Proportions 
were estimated of adults aged ≥19 years who received selected 
vaccinations during 2010–2015. Estimates of proportions 
vaccinated were stratified by age group, risk status, health 
insurance status, having a usual place for health care, number 
of physician contacts, nativity, number of years living in the 
United States, and citizenship. 
Data Source and Collection
NHIS collects information about the health and health care 
of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population using 
nationally representative samples. Face-to-face interviews are 
conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for CDC’s National 
Center for Health Statistics. The total adult sample was 
33,348 persons aged ≥19 years. Additional information on 
NHIS methods is available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/
methods.htm.
Questions about receipt of vaccinations recommended for 
adults are asked of one randomly selected adult within each 
family in the household and have been described previously (5). 
A summary is provided of questions asked to ascertain whether 
adults received influenza, pneumococcal, Td, Tdap, hepatitis A, 
hepatitis B, herpes zoster (shingles), and human papillomavirus 
(HPV) vaccines as well as to ascertain classification as health 
care personnel (HCP), whether respondents had health 
insurance coverage, and whether there is a place to which 
respondents usually go when sick or need advice on their 
health (Appendix). There were no questions in the 2015 NHIS 
to ascertain pneumococcal vaccination by type of vaccine 
(23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine or 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). The presence of selected 
conditions that increase risk for pneumococcal disease and 
are defined by ACIP as indications for pneumococcal vaccines 
(Box 1) (6) was determined by responses to questions in NHIS. 
For hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, data were collected 
also on selected respondent characteristics that increase the 
risk for infection (travel to countries in which hepatitis A 
infections are endemic and having chronic liver disease, travel 
to countries in which hepatitis B infections are endemic, and 
having diabetes or chronic liver disease, respectively).
Vaccination status and demographic and other characteristics 
(e.g., health conditions, insurance status, and usual source and 
frequency of health care) are self-reported. Race/ethnicity was 
categorized as Hispanic or Latino, black, white, Asian, and 
“other.” Persons identified as Hispanic or Latino might be of 
any race. Persons identified as black, white, Asian, or other race 
are non-Hispanic. “Other” includes American Indians/Alaska 
Natives and persons of multiple race. The five racial/ethnic 
categories are mutually exclusive. Nativity was categorized as 
U.S.-born (persons born in one of the 50 states or the District 
of Columbia) or foreign-born (persons who were not born in 
the United States).
Analysis
For the noninfluenza adult vaccination coverage estimates, 
the weighted proportion of respondents who reported receiving 
selected vaccinations was calculated. To better assess influenza 
vaccination coverage for the 2014–15 influenza season, CDC 
restricted reported coverage to persons who were interviewed 
during August 2014–June 2015 and vaccinated during July 
2014–May 2015, using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
procedure; 2014 NHIS data for August–December 2014 were 
used for the 2014 component of the 2014–15 influenza season. 
Differences were measured as the simple difference between 
the 2013–14 and 2014–15 influenza seasons. Data for missing 
months and years of vaccination (3.5%) were imputed.

disease and are defined as indications for pneumococcal vaccines

Influenza Vaccination Coverage
Influenza vaccination coverage for the 2014–15 season among 
adults aged ≥19 years was 44.8%, an increase of 1.6 percentage 
points from the 2013–14 season (Table 1). Coverage among 
whites aged ≥19 years was higher (48.5%) than that for blacks 
(37.7%) and Hispanics (33.0%). Influenza coverage was 32.5% 
among adults aged 19–49 years and 48.7% among adults aged 
50–64 years. Coverage among adults aged ≥65 years (73.5%) 
was higher compared with younger age groups. Among 
HCP aged ≥19 years, influenza vaccination coverage overall 
was 68.6%, similar to the estimate for the 2013–14 season 
(Table 2). Among HCP aged ≥19 years with and without direct 
patient care responsibilities, influenza vaccination coverage was 
68.9% and 67.9%, respectively, similar to 2013–14 estimates 
(Table 3). Influenza coverage among white HCP with direct 
patient care was higher (72.8%) than that for black (53.8%) 
and Hispanic (59.8%) HCP with direct patient care. Coverage 
was 72.0% for black HCP aged ≥19 years without direct 
patient care responsibilities, a 28.1 percentage point increase 
compared with the 2013–14 estimate. However, for the 
2014–15 season, influenza vaccination coverage among HCP 
without direct patient care responsibilities was similar across all 
racial/ethnic groups (Table 3). During the 2009–10 through 
the 2014–15 influenza seasons, fewer than half of adults aged 
≥19 years were vaccinated (range: 37.2%–44.8%). Among 
HCP
, 56.6%–68.6% reported influenza vaccination during 
this period. Linear trend tests indicated influenza vaccination 
coverage among persons aged ≥19 years and HCP aged 
≥19 years increased from the 2009–10 to 2014–15 influenza 
seasons (p<0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively) (see https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/44995).
Pneumococcal Vaccination Coverage
Reported pneumococcal vaccination coverage (23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV23] and 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13]) among adults 
aged 19–64 years at increased risk for pneumococcal disease 
was 23.0% overall, a 2.8 percentage point increase from 
2014 (Table 1). Coverage among whites aged 19–64 years at 
increased risk was higher (24.0%) compared with Hispanics 
(19.4%) but did not differ for other racial/ethnic groups 
compared with whites. Among adults aged ≥65 years, coverage 
was 63.6% overall, similar to the estimate for 2014. Coverage 
among whites aged ≥65 years (68.1%) was higher compared 
To assess adjusted vaccination coverage and adjusted 
prevalence ratios for each vaccine, logistic regression and 
predicted marginal modeling were used for selected comparisons 
(health insurance status). Estimates were adjusted for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, marital status, education, employment status, 
poverty level, number of physician contacts in the past year, 
usual source of health care, self-reported health status, nativity, 
and region of residence. Income-to-poverty ratio variables 
are included in the NHIS public use data file (https://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2015_data_release.htm). Poverty 
thresholds were defined according to family size using weighted 
average census poverty thresholds from 2013, the average 
consumer price index from 2013, actual consumer price 
index values for January–July 2014, and projected consumer 
price index values for August–December 2014 (ftp://ftp.cdc.
gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/
NHIS/2015/srvydesc.pdf).
Weighted data were used to produce national vaccination 
coverage estimates. Point estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated by using statistical software to 
account for the complex sample design, and t tests were used for 
comparisons between 2015 and 2014 and for comparisons of 
each level of each characteristic (e.g., race/ethnicity, age group, 
HCP status, patient care status, access-to-care factors, nativity, 
years of residence in the United States, and citizenship status) 
to a chosen referent level (e.g., for race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic 
white was the reference group). For influenza vaccination, 
tests for linear trend were performed using a weighted linear 
regression on the season-specific estimates, using season number 
as the independent variable and the inverse of the estimated 
variance of the estimated vaccination coverage as the weights. 
For vaccination with the other vaccines, tests for linear trend 
were performed in SUDAAN using the RATIO procedure. 
Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Coverage 
estimates are not reported for small sample size (n<30) or relative 
standard error (standard error/estimates) >0.3.
Results
The final sample adult component response rate for the 2015 
NHIS was 55.2%. The final sample adult component response 
rates for estimating influenza vaccination coverage for the 
2014–15 influenza season were 58.9% for 2014 and 55.2% for 
2015. The total adult sample for influenza coverage estimation 
was 31,897 persons aged ≥19 years. Detailed information for 
vaccination coverage estimates stratified by selected variables 
is summarized (Box 2). These selected variables include health 
insurance status, having a usual place for health care, number

with blacks (50.2%), Hispanics (41.7%), and Asians (49.0%) 
(Table 1). During 2010–2015, pneumococcal vaccination 
coverage among adults aged 19–64 years at increased risk 
and adults aged ≥65 years ranged from 18.5%–23.0% to 
59.7%–63.6%, respectively, representing increases in coverage 
for both age groups (test for trend: p< 0.01 for persons aged 
19–64 years and p = 0.01 for persons aged ≥65 years) (see 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44995).
Tetanus Vaccination Coverage
In 2015, the proportion of adults reporting having received 
any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccination during the past 10 
years was 61.6% overall for adults aged ≥19 years, 62.1% for 
adults aged 19–49 years, 64.1% for adults aged 50–64 years, 
and 56.9% for adults aged ≥65 years (Table 1). The proportion 
of adults receiving tetanus vaccination during the past 10 years 
across all age groups did not change compared with 2014. 
Whites had higher coverage across all age groups compared 
with blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. During 2010–2015, 
tetanus vaccination among adults aged ≥19 years was 
unchanged at approximately 62% (see https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/44994).
Among adults aged ≥19 years for whom Tdap vaccination 
specifically could be assessed, overall reported coverage in 
the past 10 years was 23.1%, a 3.1 percentage point increase 
compared with 2014 (Table 1). Tdap coverage for black 
(15.1%), Hispanic (14.3%), and Asian (19.9%) adults 
aged ≥19 years was lower compared with whites (27.0%).

Result summary
Association of health insurance status 
with vaccination coverage among adult 
populations
Overall, vaccination coverage was generally lower among adults without health insurance compared with 
those with health insurance. Adult vaccination coverage differed by the type of health insurance. Vaccination 
coverage was generally higher among adults with private health insurance compared with those reporting 
public health insurance. Detailed information from these analyses are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/45000.
Association of health insurance status 
and having a usual place for health care 
with vaccination coverage
Generally, adults with a usual place for health care reported having received recommended vaccinations more 
often than those who did not have a usual place for health care, regardless of whether they had health 
insurance. Among adults with health insurance, coverage was higher among those who reported having a 
usual place for health care compared with those who did not have a usual place for health care. Detailed 
information from these analyses are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44999 
Adult vaccination coverage by health 
insurance status and physician contacts
With a few exceptions (overall hepatitis A vaccination among adults aged ≥19 years and human papillomavirus 
vaccination among women aged 19–26 years), vaccination coverage was higher among those reporting 
having had one or more physician contacts in the past year compared with those who had not visited a 
physician in the past year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. In addition, vaccination coverage 
generally increased as the number of physician contacts increased. Among adults who had health insurance 
and ≥10 physician contacts within the past year, 18.2%–85.6% reported not having received vaccinations that 
were recommended either for all persons or for those with some specific indication. Detailed information 
from these analyses are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44998.
Association of respondent age with adult 
vaccination coverage
Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥65 years was higher compared with 
coverage among adults aged 19–64 years; however, Td and Tdap coverage among adults aged ≥65 years was 
lower compared with coverage among adults aged <65 years. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults 
with diabetes aged ≥60 years was lower compared with coverage among adults aged 19–59 years with 
diabetes. Herpes zoster coverage among adults aged ≥65 years was higher compared with coverage among 
adults aged 60–64 years. Detailed information from these analyses are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/45000, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44999, and https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44998.
Adult vaccination coverage adjusted for 
selected demographic and access-to-
care characteristics
Adults without health insurance were less likely than those with health insurance to be vaccinated after 
adjusting for confounders for influenza (aged ≥19 years); Td (aged ≥19 years); hepatitis A (aged ≥19 years); 
and hepatitis B (aged ≥19 years). Detailed information from these analyses are available at https://stacks.cdc.
gov/view/cdc/44997.
Adult vaccination coverage by nativity, 
years living in the United States, and 
citizenship
Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born respondents was higher than that of foreign-born respondents 
with few exceptions (influenza vaccination [adults aged 19–49 years and aged 50–64 years], hepatitis A 
vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years], and hepatitis B vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years with diabetes or 
chronic liver conditions]).
Compared with U.S.-born adults, there were large gaps in vaccination coverage among foreign-born adults for 
HPV vaccination (females aged 19–26 years [44.3% versus 22.8%]) and Tdap vaccination (adults aged 
≥ 19 years [25.6% versus 13.3%]). Vaccination status varied by time living in the United States. Coverage 
among foreign-born adults who were U.S. citizens was generally higher than that for foreign-born 
respondents who were not U.S. citizens. Detailed information from these analyses are available at https://
stacls/cdc.gov/view/cdc/44996.

2012–2015 increased from 8.0% to 16.5% among adults 
aged ≥65 years (test for trend: p<0.01) (see https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/44994). Among 16,996 respondents who 
reported receiving a tetanus vaccination during 2005–2015, 
almost half (49.1%) reported that they were not informed of 
the vaccination type, and 12.6% could not recall what type 
of tetanus vaccination they had received (Table 4). Of the 
remaining 38.3% of respondents who reported that they knew 
what type of tetanus vaccine they received, 72.0% reported 
receiving Tdap.
Overall Tdap vaccination of HCP aged ≥19 years reported 
in 2015 was 45.6%, similar to the estimate from 2014 
(Table 2). White HCP had higher Tdap coverage (49.2%) 
compared with black HCP (28.3%) and Hispanic HCP 
(38.7%). Among HCP aged ≥19 years with direct patient 
care responsibilities, Tdap vaccination coverage was 51.1%, 
similar to the 2014 estimate (Table 3). Black HCP with 
direct patient care responsibilities had lower Tdap coverage 
(31.4%) compared with white HCP (55.0%), but coverage 
for HCP in the other racial/ethnic groups was similar to that 
for white HCP (Table 3). Tdap vaccination among HCP aged 
19–64 years increased from 22.0% in 2010 to 47.2% in 2015 
(test for trend: p<0.01). Tdap vaccination among HCP aged 
≥65 years reported during 2012–2015 ranged from 16.9% to 
30.7% (see https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44994). Among 
adults aged ≥19 years who received a tetanus vaccination and 
reported that they knew what type of tetanus vaccine they 
received, HCP reported receipt of Tdap (78.2%) more often 
than did non-HCP (70.8%) (Table 4).
Hepatitis A Vaccination Coverage
In 2015, reported hepatitis A vaccination coverage (≥2 doses) 
was 9.0% for adults aged ≥19 years, 12.3% among adults 
aged 19–49 years, and 5.5% among adults aged ≥50 years, 
similar to the estimates for 2014 (Table 1). Among adults 
aged 19–49 years, coverage for Hispanics (10.4%) was lower 
than that for whites (12.8%); coverage for Asians (17.9%) was 
higher than that for whites. Vaccination coverage was higher 
among adults aged ≥19 years who had traveled outside the 
United States since 1995 to a country in which hepatitis A 
is of high or intermediate endemicity (countries other than 
the countries of Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, or 
Canada) than among respondents who did not travel outside 
the United States or had traveled only to countries in which the 
disease is of low endemicity (16.0% versus 5.4%, respectively). 
Vaccination coverage among adult travelers to countries with 
high or intermediate endemicity was similar to the estimate 
for 2014. Overall coverage among adults aged ≥19 years with 
chronic liver conditions was 8.6%, similar to the 2014 estimate 
(Table 1). During 2010–2015 among all adults aged ≥19 years, 
hepatitis A vaccination coverage increased (range: 8.1%–9.1%; 
test for trend: p = 0.04), but remained stable among travelers 
to countries with high or intermediate endemicity, among 
nontravelers, and among persons with chronic liver conditions 
(see https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44993).
Hepatitis B Vaccination Coverage
Reported hepatitis B vaccination coverage (≥3 doses) 
among adults was 24.6% for adults aged ≥19 years, 32.0% 
among adults aged 19–49 years, and 16.5% among adults 
aged ≥50 years. Overall vaccination coverage among adults 
aged ≥19 years was similar to the 2014 estimate (Table 1). 
Vaccination coverage was higher among adults aged ≥19 
years who had traveled outside the United States since 1995 
to a country in which hepatitis B is of high or intermediate 
endemicity (countries other than the countries of Europe, 
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada) than among 
respondents who did not travel outside the United States 
or had traveled only to countries in which hepatitis B is of 
low endemicity (31.6% versus 20.9%, respectively). Among 
adults aged 19–49 years, vaccination coverage was lower for 
blacks (29.4%) and Hispanics (22.5%) compared with whites 
(34.9%). Overall coverage among adults aged ≥19 years with 
chronic liver conditions was 27.4%, similar to the 2014 
estimate. Vaccination coverage for persons with diabetes was 
24.4% for those aged 19–59 years and 12.6% for those aged 
≥60 years, similar to estimates for 2014. Overall, hepatitis B 
vaccination coverage among HCP aged ≥19 years was 64.7%, 
a 4.1 percentage point increase compared with the estimate for 
2014. Black (56.7%) and Hispanic HCP (57.1%) had lower 
coverage compared with white HCP (67.8%) (Table 2). Among 
HCP aged ≥19 years with direct patient care responsibilities, 
hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 74.1%, a 6.4 percentage 
point increase compared with the 2014 estimate (Table 3). 
Coverage for black HCP aged ≥19 years with direct patient care 
responsibilities was lower (62.4%) than that for white HCP 
* In 2006, a single dose of Tdap was recommended for adults aged 19–64 years, 
especially those who have or who anticipate having close contact with an infant 
aged <1 year (e.g., parents, grandparents, child care providers, and HCP) to 
reduce the risk for transmitting pertussis.

with direct patient care responsibilities (78.2%) (Table 3). 
During 2010–2015, hepatitis B vaccination coverage decreased 
overall among adults aged ≥19 years, travelers to areas of high 
or intermediate endemicity aged ≥19 years, and nontravelers 
aged ≥19 years (range: 24.5%–27.1%, 30.5%–35.0%, and 
20.9%–23.2%, respectively; test for trend: p<0.01 for all 
groups). Hepatitis B vaccination remained stable among adults 
aged ≥19 years with chronic liver conditions and among HCP 
aged ≥19 years (see https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44993).
Herpes Zoster Vaccination Coverage
In 2015, among adults aged ≥60 years, 30.6% reported 
receiving herpes zoster vaccination to prevent shingles, a 
2.7 percentage point increase from 2014 (Table 1). Whites 
aged ≥60 years had higher herpes zoster vaccination coverage 
(34.6%) compared with blacks (13.6%), Hispanics (16.0%), 
and Asians (26.0%). Among adults aged 60–64 years, 21.7% 
reported receiving herpes zoster vaccination, with blacks 
(12.7%), Hispanics (9.1%), and Asians (14.6%) reporting 
lower coverage compared with that for whites (25.1%), similar 
to 2014 estimates. Among adults aged ≥65 years, 34.2% 
reported herpes zoster vaccination, a 3.2 percentage point 
increase from 2014. Whites aged ≥65 years had higher herpes 
zoster vaccination coverage (38.3%) compared with blacks 
(14.1%), Hispanics (19.2%), and Asians (30.6%). Herpes 
zoster vaccination among adults aged ≥60 years increased from 
14.4% in 2010 to 30.6% in 2015 (test for trend: p<0.01) (see 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44992).
HPV Vaccination Coverage
In 2015, among women aged 19–26 years, 41.6% reported 
receipt of at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine, similar to the estimate 
reported for 2014 (Table 1). Coverage among women was 
similar by age group (42.0% and 41.4%, respectively, for 
women aged 19–21 and 22–26 years), and did not change for 
either age group from 2014 estimates. Among women aged 
19–26 years, Hispanics (35.7%) had lower coverage compared 
with whites (44.7%), but coverage for blacks (38.0%), Asians 
(36.3%), and adults who indicated other race (45.5%) was 
similar to that for whites. Receipt of at least 1 dose of HPV 
vaccine among males aged 19–26 years was 10.1%, similar 
to the 2014 estimate. Coverage was 15.7% for males aged 
19–21 years and 7.3% for those aged 22–26 years, similar to 
the 2014 estimates.
Among women aged 19–26 years, 2.1% reported receiving 
the first dose of HPV vaccine at age 8–10 years, 6.2% at 
age 11–12 years, 56.1% at age 13–17 years, 16.1% at age 
18 years, and 19.6% at age 19–26 years (Table 5). Among 
males aged 19–26 years, 4.1% reported receiving the first 
dose of HPV vaccine at age 8–10 years, 6.9% at age 11–12 
years, 43.3% at age 13–17 years, 15.4% at age 18 years, and 
30.2% at age 19–26 years. Among respondents aged 19–26 
years, the difference between the age reported at the time of 
the interview and the age at which respondents indicated that 
the first dose of HPV vaccine was received was ≥11 years for 
6.1% of women and for 6.2% of males. This would imply 
receipt of vaccination in 2004 or earlier, before HPV vaccine 
was licensed for use in 2006. Among females and males aged 
19–26 years who had not received HPV vaccine prior to age 
19 years, 12.2% and 3.3% reported receiving the first dose of 
HPV vaccine at age 19–26 years, respectively. (Table 1). HPV 
vaccination increased from 20.7% in 2010 to 41.6% in 2015 
for females aged 19–26 years, and from 2.1% in 2011 to 10.1% 
in 2015 among males aged 19–26 years (test for trend: p<0.01 
for both groups) (see https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44992).
Racial and Ethnic Vaccination Differences
Compared with 2014, racial/ethnic differences in vaccination 
coverage persisted for all seven vaccines in this report and 
widened for pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccination 
(due primarily to increases among whites) (Table 1). Blacks, 
Hispanics, and Asians had lower vaccination coverage than 
that of whites for all of the vaccines routinely recommended 
for adults, except for: influenza vaccination (adults aged 
≥19 years: Asians had coverage similar to whites; aged 50–64 
years: Hispanics and Asians had coverage similar to whites; 
aged ≥65 years: Asians had coverage similar to whites); 
pneumococcal vaccination (adults aged 19–64 years with 
increased risk: blacks and Asians had coverage similar to 
whites); Tdap vaccination (adults aged ≥65 years: Asians had 
coverage similar to whites); hepatitis A vaccination (adults 
aged 19–49 years: blacks had coverage similar to and Asians 
had coverage higher than whites); hepatitis B (adults aged 
19–49 years: Asians had coverage similar to whites); and HPV 
vaccination (females aged 19–26 years: blacks and Asians had 
coverage similar to whites). 
With whites as the reference group, there were differences in 
vaccination coverage for 51 of the 66 comparisons by vaccine and 
age/target groups (not including comparisons of the “other” race/
ethnic group) (Table 6). These vaccination differences ranged 
from -2.4 percentage points for Hispanics versus whites for 
hepatitis A vaccination among adults aged 19–49 years to -26.4 
percentage points for Hispanics versus whites for pneumococcal 
vaccination among adults aged ≥65 years. 
Among HCP with direct patient care, influenza coverage 
among white HCP was higher (72.8%) than that for black 
(53.8) and Hispanic (59.8%) HCP (Table 3). Among all HCP
, 
white HCP had higher Tdap coverage (49.2%) compared

with black HCP (28.3%) and Hispanic HCP (38.7%) 
(Table 2). Black HCP with direct patient care responsibilities 
had lower Tdap coverage (31.4%) compared with white HCP 
(55.0%), but Tdap coverage for HCP with direct patient care 
responsibilities in the other racial/ethnic groups was similar 
to that for white HCP (Table 3). Black (56.7%) and Hispanic 
HCP (57.1%) had lower hepatitis B coverage compared with 
white HCP (67.8%) (Table 2). Among HCP aged ≥19 years 
with direct patient care responsibilities, hepatitis B coverage 
for black HCP was lower (62.4%) than that for white HCP 
(78.2%) (Table 3).
During 2010–2015, vaccination differences between whites 
and blacks increased for Tdap (adults aged 19–64 years), 
hepatitis A (adults aged 19–49 years), and herpes zoster 
vaccination (adults aged ≥60 years and ≥65 years) (test for 
trend: p<0.05) (Table 7). Among Hispanics, vaccination 
differences increased over this time period compared with 
whites for Td (adults aged 19–49 years), Tdap (adults 
aged ≥19 years and 19–64 years), hepatitis A (adults aged 
19–49 years), hepatitis B (HCP aged ≥19 years), and herpes 
zoster vaccination (adults aged ≥60 years and ≥65 years) (test 
for trend: p<0.05). For Asians, vaccination differences increased 
over this time period compared with whites for Tdap (adults 
aged 19–64 years) (test for trend: p<0.05). Among persons 
reporting other race, compared with whites during this time 
period vaccination gaps widened for hepatitis A vaccination 
(adults aged 19–49 years) (test for trend: p<0.05). Vaccination 
differences between whites, blacks, Hispanics, and persons 
reporting other race for the other vaccines and age groups did 
not change during this period (Table 7).
Discussion
In 2015, adult vaccination coverage in the United States 
remained similar to 2014, except for modest increases in 
influenza (adults aged ≥19 years; for influenza coverage, 
increase compared with the 2013–14 season), pneumococcal 
(adults aged 19–64 years with increased risk), Tdap (adults 
aged ≥19 years), herpes zoster (adults aged ≥60 years) and 
hepatitis B (HCP aged ≥19 years). Overall, although the point 
estimates for each year varied by only a few percentage points, 
linear trend tests indicated that during 2010–2015, vaccination 
coverage increased for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines (all 
age and risk groups), Tdap (adults aged 19–64 years), hepatitis 
A (adults aged ≥19 years), herpes zoster (adults aged ≥60 years), 
and HPV (females aged 19–26 years) vaccines and during 
2012–2015 and 2011–2015, for Tdap vaccine (adults aged ≥65 
years) and HPV vaccine (males aged 19–26 years), respectively. 
Although these increases were small, collectively they might 
have resulted in meaningful reductions in disease among 
adults (11,12). During 2010–2015 there was a decreasing 
trend observed for hepatitis B vaccination among persons aged 
≥19 years overall (Figure). Vaccination coverage estimates for 
three of the four vaccines in this report that are included in 
Healthy People 2020 (influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B 
[for HCP] vaccines) were below the respective target levels, 
including among insured adults and adults with multiple health 
care visits in the past year. Herpes zoster vaccination coverage in 
2015 was 0.6 percentage points above the Healthy People 2020 
target of 30%. Racial/ethnic differences in vaccination coverage 
persisted for all seven vaccines discussed in this report. These 
data indicate multiple missed opportunities for vaccination and 
the need to increase routine assessment of adult vaccination 
needs, and vaccination with needed vaccines.
Influenza Vaccination
Overall, less than 45% of adults aged ≥19 years were 
vaccinated annually during the influenza seasons spanning the 
2009–10 through 2014–15 seasons, well below the Healthy 
People 2020 target of 70% for annual vaccination of adults 
against seasonal influenza. Vaccination coverage among HCP 
with and without direct patient care also remained far below 
the Healthy People 2020 target for HCP of 90%. Previous 
studies of influenza illnesses and hospitalizations that could be 
averted by vaccination have indicated that higher vaccination 
rates could have resulted in prevention of a substantial number 
of influenza cases and hospitalizations (11,12). More effort 
is needed to reach the Healthy People 2020 targets to benefit 
more fully from influenza vaccines. Ensuring that all persons 
who visit a health care provider during the influenza season 
receive a vaccination recommendation and offer from their 
provider and use of vaccination information systems could 
increase influenza vaccination rates (13,14). Implementing 
interventions shown effective in increasing uptake of influenza 
vaccination among HCP including access to vaccination at the 
workplace at no cost for >1 day could improve coverage in this 
population (15–17).
Pneumococcal Vaccination
The proportion of pneumococcal vaccination by type of 
vaccine (PCV13 or PPSV23) was not measured in the 2015 
NHIS. The overall pneumococcal vaccination estimates 
in this report include respondents who received PCV13 
and/or PPSV23. Ascertaining type-specific pneumococcal 
vaccination via self-report through survey questions presents 
challenges, particularly because current information indicates 
that physicians do not routinely advise their patients about 
the types of vaccines they use (5) and the complexity of the 
 Surveillance Summaries

pneumococcal vaccination recommendations (different for 
adults with no previous pneumococcal vaccination, those 
who might have received PCV13 previously, and PCV13-
naïve adults previously vaccinated with PPSV23) (18–20). 
Pneumococcal vaccination of persons aged 19–64 years at 
increased risk and vaccination of persons aged ≥65 years 
increased during the 6 years covered in this report; however, 
both remain well below Healthy People 2020 targets of 60% for 
persons aged 18–64 years at increased risk and 90% for adults 
aged ≥65 years. Among persons aged ≥65 years, using PCV13 
in series with PPSV23 could prevent an estimated 230 cases 
of invasive pneumococcal disease and approximately 12,000 
cases of community-acquired pneumonia over the lifetime of 
a single cohort of persons currently aged 65 years through life 
expectancy (18). Achieving higher pneumococcal vaccination 
levels could improve these benefits.
Tetanus Toxoid-Containing Vaccination
A single dose of Tdap is recommended for all adults aged 
≥19 years who have not yet received a dose, including those 
aged ≥65 years, and should be administered regardless of 
interval since the most recent Td (21). Although there were

* Influenza vaccination coverage for 2010 is coverage from the 2009–10 season, 2011 is coverage from the 2010–11 season, 2012 is coverage from the 2011–12 season, 
2013 is coverage from the 2012–13 season, 2014 is coverage from the 2013–14 season, and 2015 is coverage from the 2014–15 season. Interviews from August 
through June of each season were used to estimate coverage from July through May using Kaplan Meier survival analysis. Tdap vaccination coverage data among 
adults aged ≥65 years are available beginning in the NHIS 2012 survey. The 2010 HPV vaccination coverage estimate among males is suppressed due to relative 
standard error >30%. 
† Adults were considered at increased risk for pneumococcal disease if they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes, 
emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (beginning in 2012), coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a diagnosis of 
cancer during the previous 12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had lymphoma, 
leukemia, or blood cancer; had been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys during the preceding 
12 months; had an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months; or they were current smokers.

modest increases in Tdap vaccination of adults from 2010 
to 2015, coverage has remained low for all age groups and 
among adults living with an infant aged <1 year. Recent 
studies have shown that Tdap vaccination is highly effective 
at preventing pertussis among adolescents in the short-term; 
however, there is rapid waning of immunity in the years 
following Tdap receipt (22–28). Evidence indicates that the 
duration of protection wanes more quickly from acellular 
pertussis-containing vaccines than immunity derived from 
whole-cell pertussis vaccine formulations, and that the type 
of priming dose received (i.e., acellular pertussis vaccine 
or whole-cell pertussis vaccine) influences the durability of 
immunity (22–24,29,30). There is evidence that receiving at 
least a single dose of whole-cell pertussis vaccine, especially as 
the first dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine series, provides 
greater and longer-lived protection, irrespective of the type of 
subsequent doses (22–24,29,30). In the United States, booster 
doses with acellular pertussis-containing vaccines for infants 
and children (the fourth and fifth doses of the childhood 
series administered at ages 15–18 months and 4–6 years, 
respectively) were first recommended to replace whole-cell 
pertussis vaccine formulations in 1992 and primary doses 
administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months were recommended 
in 1997 (22–24). Given the timing of the transition, many 
young and older adults would have been primed with whole-
cell pertussis vaccine and might have more durable immunity 
(22,24,26). Despite the observed limitations of Tdap, current 
vaccination strategies remain the best approach to reducing the 
burden of pertussis among adolescents and adults (24). Health 
care providers should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate 
adults aged ≥19 years who have not received Tdap previously. 
Pregnant women are recommended to receive a dose of Tdap 
during every pregnancy, optimally between 27 and 36 weeks 
gestation, to provide protection to young infants through 
maternal antibody transfer (31).
Hepatitis A Vaccination
Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for persons traveling 
to or working in countries that have high or intermediate 
endemicity of hepatitis A, if some risk factor is present (e.g., on 
the basis of lifestyle, occupation, or medical condition) or for 
any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus infection 
(6). Information was available only for those with foreign 
travel to areas of high or intermediate endemicity and those 
with chronic liver disease. Although hepatitis A vaccination of 
adults who had traveled outside the United States to a country 
in which hepatitis A is of high or intermediate endemicity was 
higher in 2015 and preceding years than among adults who 
did not travel outside the United States or had traveled only 
to countries in which the disease is of low endemicity, overall 
hepatitis A vaccination among travelers and persons with 
chronic liver disease has remained low. Health care providers are 
encouraged to assess the needs of their patients for hepatitis A 
vaccine and offer it whenever appropriate.
Hepatitis B Vaccination
Hepatitis B vaccination coverage in 2015 among persons 
with diabetes showed no improvement over estimates obtained 
before this recommendation, which underscores the need to 
improve awareness of increased risk for contracting acute 
hepatitis B among persons with diabetes and to increase 
hepatitis B vaccination in this population. Similar to hepatitis A 
vaccination, overall hepatitis B vaccination among travelers and 
persons with chronic liver disease has remained low, although 
hepatitis B vaccination of persons who had traveled outside 
the United States to a country in which hepatitis B is of high 
or intermediate endemicity was higher in 2015 and preceding 
years than among respondents who did not travel outside the 
United States or had traveled only to countries in which the 
disease is of low endemicity. During 2010–2015, estimates 
of hepatitis B vaccination among HCP have not improved, 
ranging from 61%–65%, well below the Healthy People 2020 
target of 90%.
Herpes Zoster Vaccination
Herpes zoster vaccination coverage for adults aged ≥60 years 
was 30.6% in 2015, a 2.7 percentage point increase compared 
with 2014, and 0.6 percentage points above the Healthy People 
2020 target of 30%. While the Healthy People 2020 target 
was achieved, approximately 70% of adults recommended to 
receive this vaccine remain unprotected. Although shortages 
of herpes zoster vaccine that likely contributed to low uptake 
during the first years after licensure were resolved, other barriers 
persist, particularly the high cost for providers to purchase 
a supply, challenges to stocking the vaccine (which requires 
freezer storage), coverage for the vaccine under Medicare Part 
D, which results in billing challenges for medical providers 
other than pharmacist vaccine providers, and out-of-pocket 
payments for some Medicare Part D beneficiaries depending 
on their specific plan (32,33). Although health care provider 
recommendations for vaccination are strongly associated with 
a patient’s receipt of vaccines (9,13,14), individual awareness 
of vaccine-preventable disease consequences can also influence 
vaccination behavior. For example, rates of herpes zoster 
vaccination were increased among persons who witnessed 
friends or family members experience herpes zoster (34), 
particularly if the herpes zoster was severe (CDC, Division 
of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and 
 Surveillance Summaries
MMWR / May 5, 2017 / Vol. 66 / No. 11

Respiratory Diseases, unpublished data, 2016). In one study 
(34), blacks had a lower rate of self-reported prevalence of 
herpes zoster and of witnessing friends or family members 
with herpes zoster compared with whites. These factors might 
have influenced perceived risk for herpes zoster among blacks 
in that study, their interest in herpes zoster vaccination, 
and contributed to the lower vaccination levels among 
blacks observed in this study population (34). Vaccination 
with the current live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine is 
contraindicated in immunocompromised persons (35). Studies 
and clinical trials of other herpes zoster vaccines have been 
conducted to identify immunizing agents that could protect 
more population groups, including selected populations of 
immunocompromised patients considered at increased risk 
for herpes zoster infection and complications (36–42) and 
older adults (40–42).  
HPV Vaccination
ACIP has recommended routine vaccination at age 11 or 
12 years for girls since 2006 and for boys since 2011. ACIP 
also recommends vaccination for females aged 13–26 years 
and for males aged 13–21 years who have not been vaccinated 
previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series; 
males aged 22–26 years may be vaccinated (43,44). Although 
vaccination coverage has increased since a licensed HPV 
vaccine has been available and recommended by ACIP
, 
many adolescent and young adult females and males remain 
unvaccinated and vulnerable to develop cancers that safe, 
effective HPV vaccines can prevent (5,43,45).
In 2015 among women and men aged 19–26 years, 6.2% 
and 6.9% reported receiving the first dose of HPV vaccine at 
age 11–12 years, respectively, with most (91.8% of females 
and 88.8% of males) reporting receipt at age ≥13 years, 
consistent with the fact that female respondents aged ≥22 years 
and all male respondents would have been aged >13 years at 
the time HPV vaccination was first recommended. In 2015, 
approximately 12% of females and 3% of males aged 19–26 
years not vaccinated at age ≤18 years reported receiving the first 
dose of HPV vaccine as catch-up at age 19–26 years. Since HPV 
vaccine licensure, multiple cohorts of unvaccinated adolescents 
and young adults have accumulated. Based on 2015 data 
alone, as many as 9.1 million women and approximately 13.9 
million men aged 19–26 years were unvaccinated and might 
benefit from HPV vaccination assuming no contraindications 
to vaccination. Until HPV vaccination increases among 
adolescents, a high proportion of unprotected young women 
and men eligible for HPV vaccination will be expected. For 
example, in the 2015 National Immunization Survey – Teen 
(45), provider-reported vaccination histories indicated that 
among females and males aged 17 years, 29.4% (582,947) 
and 49.6% (980,637), respectively, were unvaccinated (having 
not received at least one HPV vaccine dose) (45). These 
estimates reflect the current pool of females and males who 
could benefit from catch-up vaccination and the number of 
unprotected older adolescents adding to that pool annually. 
Studies have found that although HPV infection increases 
with increasing age after sexual debut, most women have not 
been infected with all the high risk HPV types targeted by 
the vaccines (46,47), supporting implementation of ACIP-
recommended catch-up vaccination, because vaccination can 
protect against HPV types for which vaccination candidates 
have not been infected. Results from modeling and studies of 
the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination of young women 
and men suggest that catch-up vaccination could reduce the 
amount of time needed to achieve population level impacts of 
vaccination on infections with HPV vaccine types and sequelae 
such as cancer (48–55). Findings from initial studies of vaccine 
impact in settings in which catch-up vaccination programs 
were successful in achieving high coverage rates among young 
women are consistent with these models (56–59). Although 
cost-effectiveness studies indicate that catch-up vaccination 
might become less favorable over time, a long-term strategy 
of HPV vaccination of young adult females through age 
18–26 years could be considered cost-effective and, when 
combined with an adolescent vaccination program, appears to 
represent an effective strategy (49,50,54,55,60–67). Data for 
the years 2008–2012 from population-based cancer registries 
(that participate in CDC’s National Program of Cancer 
Registries and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results program) indicated that of the 
average of 38,793 HPV-associated cancers diagnosed annually 
(11.7 per 100,000 persons; including 23,000 [13.5] among 
females and 15,793 [9.7] among males), 30,700 (79%) were 
estimated to be attributable to HPV based on polymerase 
chain reaction genotyping studies (68). Among these HPV-
associated cancers, 24,600 (80%) were attributable to HPV 
types 16 and 18, which can be prevented by HPV vaccines 
(bivalent, quadrivalent and 9-valent vaccines), and 3,800 
(12%) were attributable to the five additional HPV types which 
can be prevented by the 9-valent vaccine (HPV types 31, 33, 
45, 52, 58). Although these findings represented an overall 
increase in HPV-associated cancer incidence from 10.8 per 
100,000 persons to 11.7 per 100,000 persons, compared with 
a previous analysis which reported cases diagnosed annually 
during 2004–2008 (69), impact of vaccination activities on 
HPV-attributable cancers will not be observed for decades after 
vaccine introduction. However, impact of HPV vaccination 
programs already has been observed on HPV prevalence, 
genital warts and cervical precancers (70–78). Increasing

HPV vaccination coverage could lead to greater decreases in 
HPV attributable diseases in the United States. Continued 
efforts are needed to improve coverage among members of 
the primary target group for HPV vaccine, girls and boys aged 
11–12 years (79), and among all racial and ethnic groups. To 
reduce the amount of time needed to achieve population level 
impacts of vaccination such as reduction in HPV-associated 
cancer incidence, efforts also are needed to improve catch-up 
vaccination among those who have not started or completed 
their vaccination.
Racial and Ethnic Differences in 
Vaccination
Compared with 2014, racial/ethnic differences in vaccination 
coverage persisted for all seven vaccines in this report. Generally 
higher coverage was observed for whites compared with most 
other groups. These differences widened for pneumococcal and 
herpes zoster vaccination (due primarily to increases among 
whites). Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had lower vaccination 
coverage than that of whites for all of the vaccines routinely 
recommended for adults, with just a few exceptions. Among 
HCP
, there were differences for influenza, Tdap, and hepatitis B 
vaccination, with white HCP generally having higher vaccination 
coverage compared with black and Hispanic HCP
.
The findings provided in this report are consistent with those 
from a study on racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination 
coverage among adults using 2012 NHIS data (80). Five 
vaccines were included in this study (influenza, pneumococcal 
[both PPSV23 and PCV13], tetanus (Td), herpes zoster, and 
HPV). There were vaccination disparities for most other 
groups compared with whites for 17 of the 24 comparisons 
by vaccine and age/target groups, even after adjusting for 
demographic and access-to-care characteristics. In most of the 
logistic models, whites reported receipt of vaccinations more 
often than blacks, Hispanics, and Asians after controlling for 
other demographic and access-to-care characteristics. Factors 
that were independently associated with receipt of most of 
the examined vaccines included race and ethnicity, age, sex, 
education, health insurance, and having a usual place for health 
care. The number of physician visits in the past 12 months was 
independently associated with receipt of all the vaccinations 
assessed in this study. Results from this study indicated that 
racial and ethnic differences in vaccination levels narrow when 
adjusting for socioeconomic factors analyzed in this survey, 
but are not eliminated, suggesting that other factors that are 
associated with vaccination disparities are not measured by the 
NHIS and could also contribute to the differences in coverage.
Previous research has indicated a variety of factors that 
contribute to racial/ethnic differences in adult vaccination 
rates, including patient, provider, and system factors (81–84). 
Standardized offering of vaccines reduces these differences 
(85,86). Using a combination of patient tracking, vaccination 
reminders for providers and patients, and patient outreach and 
assistance also reduces racial/ethnic vaccination differences 
(87). Incorporating standards for adult vaccination practices, 
which include routinely assessing vaccination needs during 
clinical encounters, providing a strong recommendation for 
vaccination to patients with indications, and then offering 
vaccination at the visit (14), can reduce vaccination disparities.
Improving Adult Vaccination Coverage
Adult vaccination coverage remains low for most routinely 
recommended vaccines. Racial/ethnic differences in coverage 
persisted for all seven vaccines in this report with higher 
coverage, generally, for whites compared with most other 
groups. Factors that contribute to low adult vaccination rates 
(including patient- and provider-level barriers and systems-
related factors) have been described (5,88–96) and effective, 
evidence-based strategies to improve vaccine use have been 
reported (13,88). The National Vaccine Advisory Committee 
published updated standards for adult immunization practice 
in 2014 with the intent of improving adult vaccination 
coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines. This guidance 
calls on health care providers, including those who do not 
stock vaccines, to 1) assess the vaccination status of patients 
at every clinical encounter; 2) recommend needed vaccines 
for patients; 3) offer recommended vaccines or, for providers 
who do not stock a needed vaccine, refer patients to a vaccine 
provider; and 4) document vaccines administered, including 
in immunization information systems when available for use 
among adult patients (14). Nationwide adoption of electronic 
health records (EHRs), electronic patient portals, and patient-
directed clinical decision support delivered via patient portals 
offer opportunities for innovative approaches to improving 
adult vaccination rates. For example, to improve influenza 
vaccination among eligible adult patients, a protocol is being 
evaluated in a large multispecialty group practice. The protocol 
uses patient-directed clinical decision support involving EHR 
patient portal messages and interactive voice recognition calls 
to promote influenza vaccination and obtain patient self-report 
of vaccines received outside the practice as well as information 
on barriers to vaccination (97). To improve administration 
and documentation of receipt of Tdap, consensus-based 
teams of clinicians, nurses, medical assistants, and other 
support staff have used an automated clinical reminder system 
to provide patient-specific vaccination recommendations 
to clinicians at the point of care (98). Seven large medical 
groups participating in an adult immunization best practices

collaborative in six states have used a clinical data repository 
comprised of claims data, billing data, and data from electronic 
clinical systems to increase influenza vaccination in adults 
aged ≥18 years and pneumococcal vaccination successfully 
among groups at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal 
disease (99,100). Various strategies have been evaluated for 
increasing influenza, Tdap, and HPV vaccination in select 
populations such as pregnant women and women in the 
general population, including interventions to overcome 
provider and system barriers (e.g., physician education and 
reminders) (101), interventions to increase demand for 
vaccination (e.g., text messaging encouraging vaccination in an 
ambulatory obstetric population) (102), and interventions to 
enhance vaccine access (103–107). The expanded availability 
of vaccine services in pharmacies and other retail settings has 
also improved vaccine accessibility (108–110). To increase 
targeted vaccination coverage, the Task Force on Community 
Preventive Services recommends a combination of strategies 
that include selected interventions from two or three categories: 
increasing community demand for vaccinations, enhancing 
access to vaccination services, and provider- or system-based 
interventions (13,111).
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least eight 
limitations. First, the NHIS sample excludes persons in the 
military and those residing in institutions, which might result 
in underestimation or overestimation of vaccination coverage 
levels. Second, the response rate was 55.2%. Nonresponse bias 
can result if respondents and nonrespondents differ in their 
vaccination rates. Third, the determination of vaccination 
status and identification of high-risk conditions in NHIS 
were not validated by medical records. Fourth, self-report 
of vaccination might be subject to recall bias. Young adults 
(e.g., persons aged 19–26 years), particularly, might not 
be able to recall accurately vaccines received as infants or 
adolescents. However, adult self-reported vaccination status 
has been shown to be ≥70% sensitive in one or more studies 
for influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus toxoid-containing, herpes 
zoster, and hepatitis B vaccines and ≥70% specific in one or 
more studies for all except tetanus and hepatitis B vaccination 
(112–115). Fifth, demographic and other characteristics (e.g., 
insurance status, usual source, and frequency of health care) 
were self-reported and were not validated. Sixth, the Tdap 
estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty. Respondents 
who reported a tetanus vaccination but were unable to say 
whether Td or Tdap was used during 2005–2015 were 
excluded from estimations of Tdap coverage, creating a 
potential for bias. Sensitivity calculations were conducted to 
assess the magnitude of potential bias. Depending on what 
proportion of excluded respondents actually received Tdap, 
Tdap coverage could fall within the range of 15.3%–49.3% 
for adults aged ≥19 years, 16.3%–50.4% for adults aged 
19–64 years, and 11.0%–44.5% for adults aged ≥65 years. 
To assess the potential impact of excluding respondents from 
estimation of Tdap coverage, multiple imputation was used to 
impute missing Tdap vaccination status among respondents 
who reported a tetanus vaccination but were unable to say 
whether Td or Tdap was received and these estimates were 
compared with Tdap estimates derived by excluding these 
respondents. The multiple imputation model included age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, employment 
status, poverty level, number of physician contacts in the past 
year, usual source of care, self-reported health status, nativity, 
and four regions of U.S. residence defined in the NHIS 
(Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). The estimates derived 
by excluding respondents who were unable to say whether Td 
or Tdap was received and by multiple imputation differed by 
less than one percentage point for respondents aged ≥19 years, 
aged 19–64 years, and those aged ≥65 years (differences: 0.6, 
0.7, and 0.3, respectively). Comparisons of Tdap coverage 
across years within subgroups also might be affected by bias 
resulting from excluding persons who did not report the type of 
tetanus vaccine they received. Seventh, age at vaccination is not 
known for vaccines adults reported having “ever” received (e.g., 
pneumococcal, hepatitis B, HPV and herpes zoster vaccines), so 
it is not clear for younger adults whether vaccination occurred 
as an adult or as part of a child or adolescent vaccination 
program (hepatitis B and HPV vaccination) or among older 
adults how to interpret age-specific findings. These data might 
provide a reasonable measure of population protection but not 
of year to year programmatic change. Finally, the prevalence of 
selected behavioral characteristics in populations, including the 
use of preventive health services, vaccine safety concerns, state 
laws and vaccination intervention programs, cultural, religious, 
and other factors might affect vaccination coverage. Although 
NHIS collects information on use of preventive health services 
other than vaccination, this information was not included in 
this analysis. NHIS did not collect information on the other 
factors listed above.
Conclusions
The findings provided in this report indicate that 
vaccination coverage levels among U.S. adults are not optimal. 
Improvement in adult vaccination is needed to reduce the 
health consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases among

adults. Awareness of the need for vaccines for adults is low 
among the general population, and adult patients rely on 
provider recommendations for vaccination (88–91,93). 
Successful vaccination programs combine 1) education 
of potential vaccine recipients and publicity to promote 
vaccination; 2) increased access to vaccination services in health 
care settings; and 3) use of practices that improve vaccination 
coverage, including reminder-recall systems, efforts to remove 
administrative and financial barriers to vaccination, use of 
standing order programs for vaccination, and assessment of 
practice-level vaccination rates with feedback to staff members 
(13,14,116). Health care provider recommendations for 
vaccination are strongly associated with a patient’s receipt of 
vaccines (87,117–119). Incorporating routine assessment of 
adult patient vaccination needs, recommendation, and offer 
of needed vaccinations for adults into routine clinical care of 
adults can help improve vaccination rates and narrow widening 
racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage (13,14). 
The adult immunization schedule (6), updated annually, 
provides current recommendations for vaccinating adults and 
a ready resource for persons who provide health care services 
for adults in various settings. Assessing the associations 
between vaccination and sociodemographic and other factors 
is important for understanding factors that contribute to 
low coverage rates and to disparities in vaccination, and for 
implementing strategies to improve vaccination coverage.

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HPV = human papillomavirus; 
Td = tetanus-diphtheria toxoid; Tdap = tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular 
pertussis vaccine.
 
* Adults were considered at increased risk for pneumococcal disease if they 
had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had 
diabetes, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary 
heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a 
diagnosis of cancer during the previous 12 months (excluding 
nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been told by a doctor or other health 
professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, or blood cancer; had 
been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had chronic 
bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys during the preceding 12 months; had 
an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months; or were 
current smokers. For hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, data were 
collected on selected respondent characteristics that increase the risk for 
infection (travel to countries where hepatitis A infections are endemic and 
having chronic liver disease; having diabetes, travel to countries where 
hepatitis B infections are endemic, and having chronic liver disease, 
respectively).
 
† Race/ethnicity was categorized as follows: Hispanic, black, white, Asian 
and “other.” In this report, persons identified as Hispanic might be of any 
race. Persons identified as black, white, Asian, or other race are non-
Hispanic. “Other” includes American Indian/Alaska Native and multiple 
race. The five racial/ethnic categories are mutually exclusive.
 
§ Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza shot or nasal 
spray in the past 12 months and if so, in which month and year. Missing 
month and year were imputed (3.5%) and interviews conducted during 
August 2014–June 2015 were used to estimate vaccination coverage 
during July 2014–May 2015 using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. 
Differences were measured as the simple difference between the 2013–14 
and 2014–15 influenza seasons.
 
¶ p<0.05 by T test for comparisons between 2015 and 2014 (overall and 
within each level of each characteristic).
 
** p<0.05 by T test for comparisons with non-Hispanic white as the 
reference group.
 
†† Respondents were asked if they had ever had a pneumonia shot.
 
§§ Respondents were asked if they had received a tetanus shot in the past 
10 years. Vaccinated respondents included adults who received Td during 
the past 10 years or Tdap during 2005–2015.
 
¶¶ Respondents who had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years were 
asked if their most recent shot was given in 2005 or later. Respondents 
who had received a tetanus shot since 2005 were asked if they were told 
that their most recent tetanus shot included the pertussis or whooping 
cough vaccine. Among 33,348 respondents aged ≥19 years, those without 
a “yes” or “no” classification for tetanus vaccination status within the 
preceding 10 years (n = 1,907 [5.7%]), for tetanus vaccination status during 
2005–2015 (n = 591 [1.7%]), or those who reported tetanus vaccination 
during 2005–2015, but were not told vaccine type by the provider (n = 
8,408 [25.2%]), did not know vaccine type (Td or Tdap) (n = 2,031 [6.1%]),

* Respondents were asked, “How old were you when you received your first 
HPV shot?”
† The simple difference between age reported at time of interview and age the 
respondent indicated the first dose of the HPV vaccine was received. A 
difference of “zero” indicates that a respondent’s reported age at first dose was 
the same as their age at interview.

* Adults were considered at increased risk for pneumococcal disease if they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes, 
emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a diagnosis of cancer during the 
previous 12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, or 
blood cancer; had been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys during the preceding 12 months; 
had an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months; or were current smokers.
 
† Percentage point difference in vaccination coverage compared with non-Hispanic whites as the reference group.
 
§ Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza shot or nasal spray in the past 12 months and if so, in which month and year. Missing month and year 
were imputed (3.5%) and interviews conducted during August 2014–June 2015 were used to estimate vaccination coverage during July 2014–May 2015 using 
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis.
 
¶ p<0.05 by T test for comparisons with non-Hispanic white as the reference group.
 ** Adults were classified as HCP if they reported that they currently volunteer or work in a hospital, medical clinic, doctor’s office, dentist’s office, nursing home or 
some other health care facility including part-time and unpaid work in a health care facility as well as professional nursing care provided in the home.
 
†† Respondents were asked if they had ever had a pneumonia shot.
 
§§ Respondents were asked if they had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years. Vaccinated respondents included adults who received Td during the past 10 years 
or Tdap during 2005–2015.
 
¶¶ Respondents who had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years were asked if their most recent shot was given in 2005 or later. Respondents who had received 
a tetanus shot since 2005 were asked if they were told that their most recent tetanus shot included the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine. Among 33,348 
respondents aged ≥19 years, those without a “yes” or “no” classification for tetanus vaccination status within the preceding 10 years (n = 1,907 [5.7%]), for tetanus 
vaccination status during 2005–2015 (n = 591 [1.7%]), or those who reported tetanus vaccination during 2005–2015, but were not told vaccine type by the 
provider (n = 8,408 [25.2%]), did not know vaccine type (Td or Tdap) (n = 2,031 [6.1%]), or refused to answer or for whom data were not obtained (n = 5 [0.01%]) 
were excluded, yielding a sample of 20,406 respondents aged ≥19 years for whom Tdap vaccination status could be assessed. In February 2012, ACIP recommended 
Tdap vaccination for all adults aged ≥19 years, including adults aged ≥65 years.
 *** Estimate is not reliable due to small sample size (n<30) or relative standard error (standard error/estimates) >0.3.
 ††† Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis A vaccine, and if yes, were asked how many doses were received.
 §§§ Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis B vaccine, and if yes, if they had received at least 3 doses or less than 3 doses.
 ¶¶¶ Respondents were asked if they had ever received a shingles vaccine.
 
**** Respondents were asked if they had ever received the HPV shot or cervical cancer vaccine, and if yes, age at the first dose.

Appendix
Ascertainment of Vaccination Status
Influenza vaccination: Respondents were asked if they had 
received an influenza shot or nasal spray in the past 12 months 
and if so, in which month and year.
Pneumococcal vaccination: Respondents were asked if they 
had ever had a pneumonia shot. There were no questions in 
the 2015 NHIS to ascertain pneumococcal vaccination by 
type of vaccine (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine).
Tetanus vaccination: Respondents were asked if they had 
received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years. Respondents 
who had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years were 
asked if their most recent shot was received in 2005 or later. 
Respondents who had received a tetanus shot since 2005 were 
asked if they were told that their most recent tetanus shot 
included the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine.
Hepatitis A vaccination: Respondents were asked if they had 
ever received the hepatitis A vaccine, and if yes, how many 
doses were received.
Hepatitis B vaccination: Respondents were asked if they had 
ever received the hepatitis B vaccine, and if yes, whether they 
had received ≥3 doses or <3 doses.
Herpes zoster vaccination: Respondents were asked if they 
had ever received a shingles vaccine.
HPV vaccination: Respondents were asked if they had ever 
received an HPV shot or cervical cancer vaccine, and if yes, 
age at the first dose.
Classification as Health Care Personnel
Adults were classified as health care personnel if they reported 
that they currently volunteer or work in a hospital, medical 
clinic, doctor’s office, dentist’s office, nursing home, or some 
other health care facility including part-time and unpaid 
work in a health care facility as well as professional nursing 
care provided in the home.
Ascertainment of Health Insurance Status
Adults were considered insured if they reported having pub-
lic health insurance coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, military 
health care [TRICARE/VA/CHAMP-VA], Indian Health 
Service, state-sponsored health plan, or other government 
program insurance) or private health insurance coverage.
Ascertainment of Having a Usual Place for 
Health Care
Respondents were asked if there is a place to which they 
usually go when sick or need advice on their health. 
Respondents answering “yes” were defined as having a usual 
place for health care.
