 Tripping up addiction: the use of psychedelic drugs in
the treatment of problematic drug and alcohol use

Psychedelic drugs have been used as treatments in indigenous
cultures for thousands of years. Yet, due to their legal status,
there has been limited scientific research into the therapeutic
potential of these compounds for psychiatric disorders. In the
absence of other effective treatments however, researchers
have begun again to systematically investigate such
compounds and there is now evidence pointing to the use of
psychedelic drugs in the treatment of addiction. In this review
we focus on human evidence for the effectiveness of
preparations used by indigenous cultures in the Amazon
(ayahausca) and Africa (ibogaine) and worldwide (psilocybin),
and more recently synthetised drugs such as the serotonergic
hallucinogen LSD and the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine.
Potential mechanisms explored are anti-depressant effects,
changes in neuroplasticity and existential psychological effects
of these drugs.

‘‘If, therefore, under LSD we can have a temporary
reduction, so that we can better see what we are and
where we are going — well, that might be of some help.
The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be
of some value to some people, and practically no damage
to anyone.’’ Bill Wilson, founder of Alcoholics Anony-
mous [Francis Hartigan, Bill W., Chapter 25, pp. 190–197
and pp. 170–171, St. Martins Press, 2000].
The founder of alcoholics anonymous, Bill Wilson, is
reported to have been treated with lysergic acid diethy-
lamide (LSD) to help him stay abstinent from alcohol [1]
and he credited it with helpful therapeutic properties. Yet
the idea that illicit drugs can be used in the treatment of
drug and alcohol addiction sits uncomfortably with many
clinicians and researchers. It can appear paradoxical: illicit
drugs are allegedly controlled due to their high abuse
potential so it seems unethical to give them to people who
already have a propensity for problematic alcohol and
other drug use. Will they not then become addicted to the
very substances that are being used to treat them? Cen-
turies of practise and decades of research suggest that this
is not the case. And now with emerging neurobiological
understanding of their mechanisms, these compounds are
poised to change the future of addiction treatment.
Lysergic acid diethylamide
LSD was first synthesised in 1938 from ergotamine, a
chemical from the ergot fungus. LSD’s psychological
effects, usually last between 6 and 12 hours and can vary
greatly in content across sets and settings [2]. Pharmaco-
logically, LSD is a classic serotonergic hallucinogen, with
its psychedelic effects attributed to its 5HT-2A receptor
agonism [3].
In the 1950s and 1960s, there was substantial research into
LSD being used as a treatment for alcohol dependence
[4]. In recent years, this interest has been reignited. A
number of review papers and one meta-analysis have
reviewed studies from the height of LSD research
[5,6��,7]. The meta-analysis [6��] combined the results
of 6 randomised controlled trials, to assess efficacy of LSD
as a treatment for alcoholism (536 participants in total).
Across the studies included, 59% of active treatment
participants versus 38% of controls showed reliable im-
provement during the first follow up (1–2 months) and
these differences were still reliable at 6 months. Whilst
most research has focused on alcohol, one study of
patients addicted to opioids treated with LSD demon-
strated some degree of effectiveness [8]. Importantly, the
first study on the acute effects of LSD on brain mecha-
nisms in healthy volunteers was recently published [9],
which may herald a new era of medical use of the drug.
Psilocybin
Psilocybin is a compound that occurs naturally in over
200 species of mushrooms. Psilocybin mushrooms have
been used as spiritual catalysts in indigenous cultures for
millennia, where the mushrooms are revered as powerful
spiritual sacraments that provide access to ancestors and
other worlds. The effects of psilocybin last between 2 and

 6 hours dependent on dose and individual metabolism.
Psilocybin’s psychedelic effects, like those of LSD,
are attributable to its action as a 5HT-2A receptor
agonist [10].
Psilocybin has been investigated as a tool to treat nicotine
addiction [11�] and alcohol dependence [12�]. In one
study, 15 nicotine dependent smokers were given mod-
erate and high doses of psilocybin within a structured
programme of cognitive behavioural therapy [11�]. At six-
month follow up, 12 of the 15 participants were smoking
free. At 12-month follow-up, 10 participants were still
smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up (>16 months),
nine participants were still confirmed as smoking absti-
nent. In addition, when asked at 12-month follow-up
13 participants rated their psilocybin experiences among
the five most personally meaningful and spiritually sig-
nificant experiences of their lives [13]. Similarly, 10 volun-
teers with severe alcohol use disorder were given
psilocybin alongside a psychosocial intervention. A sig-
nificant reduction in drinking was observed relative to
pre-psilocybin levels [12�]. Although promising, these
studies suffer from the absence of control group; however,
more rigorous studies are currently underway.
Ibogaine
Ibogaine is a psychoactive, indole alkaloid which is natu-
rally found in the rootbark of a Central African plant called
Tabernanthe iboga. Ibogaine produces a profound psyche-
delic state in which visual hallucinations, often focused on
prior life events, occur and feelings of normality do not
return for up to 72 hours [14]. Over the past three decades,
ibogaine has received interest as a possible anti-craving
and anti-withdrawal aid for drug addiction, primarily opi-
ate and cocaine addictions [15]. In the mid-1990s, the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) began a pro-
gramme of research into ibogaine’s potentially therapeutic
effects in drug addiction [16], although this was prema-
turely disbanded due to concerns over potential harms.
Despite this, ‘alternative’ ibogaine treatment centres are
used by people with addictions around the world
[17�,18,19] and it is estimated that over 3000 people have
taken ibogaine, chiefly as a treatment for drug addiction
[18] and it is licensed as a treatment in New Zealand.
No double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have
investigated the efficacy of ibogaine to treat addiction.
There are, however, a variety of observational reports
which describe the moderate success of ibogaine treating
opiate and cocaine addiction/withdrawal in informal treat-
ment settings [14,20–23]. More recently, interest has
been reignited with two new observational studies taking
place in Mexico and New Zealand [24,25]. These results
and ongoing studies are promising, but properly con-
trolled experimental research is much needed. Impor-
tantly, there have been some well-reported fatalities
associated with ibogaine use, specifically a woman from
the Netherlands, whose death contributed to the closure
of the NIDA-funded research in the 1990s [14,16]. This
may be due to the tradition of using ibogaine during
opioid withdrawal — where there is extreme physiologi-
cal reactions that might exacerbate ibogaine toxicity.
Trials using patients in abstinence might be better.
Ayahuasca
Ayahuasca is an Amazonian psychoactive brew made from
the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the Psychotria viridis bush,
along with a variety of other Amazonian plants [26], which
produces an altered state of consciousness involving
perceptual and affective changes [27]. Ayahuasca is taken
in religious and shamanistic settings, as well as in informal
treatment centres [26]. The compounds thought to be
critical in its psychedelic effects are dimethyltryptamine
(DMT) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as har-
mine; the latter compounds allow DMT to be active via
the oral route as they block its metabolism in gut and liver
[28] and then bind strongly to 5HT-2A receptors [29].
There are a variety of reports that suggest ayahuasca
consumption is associated with reduced alcohol and drug
problems [30–32]. One recent observational study found
reductions in alcohol, cocaine and tobacco use, and
improvements in subjective wellbeing in a sample of
12 people who were treated with ayahuasca for drug
problems [27].
Ketamine
Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
antagonist, when administered at sub-anaesthetic doses
can lead to a psychedelic state. Researchers have
attempted to incorporate this state into therapeutic inter-
ventions for addiction. Ketamine has a good safety profile
with minimal impact on the respiratory system as well as a
short half-life, so any psychedelic effects wear off quickly
post infusion [33,34,35��]. Therefore, ketamine is an
attractive drug to use in this treatment context.
One influential study demonstrated the remarkable po-
tential for ketamine psychedelic therapy (KPT) to treat
alcohol dependence [36]. An impressive 66% of detoxi-
fied alcoholics were found to maintain abstinence a year
after KPT as compared to only 24% of those patients who
engaged with conventional treatment. However, patients
were not randomised to a condition, instead they chose
whether to participate in KPT or conventional treatment.
These preliminary findings have been supported by case
studies using ketamine and transpersonal therapy; 70%
abstinence rates at one year have been shown in
15 patients [37�]. As ever, randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) are needed to fully understand efficacy and two
RCTs investigating ketamine as a treatment for alcohol
dependence are currently underway. One RCT has
been conducted with heroin addicts, which reported
substantially greater abstinence rates following a large,
72

www.sciencedirect.com
 ‘psychedelic’ dose of ketamine compared to a low, ‘non-
psychedelic’ dose of ketamine [38��]. No placebo control
group was used in this study, however.
Impacts of ketamine administration on cocaine abuse
have also been investigated. Ketamine administration,
combined with relaxation, has been shown to increase
motivation to quit, decrease craving and reduce cocaine
self-administration in the laboratory 24 hours post-infu-
sion [39,40]. Interestingly, the mystical element and
intensity of the experience have been shown to mediate
motivation to quit [41].
Mechanisms of action
These psychedelic drugs have plausibly different mech-
anistic actions, related to their specific effects on 5HT-2A
or NMDA receptors. However, here, we strive for a more
parsimonious 
explanation 
of 
the 
similar 
long-term
changes in behaviour that are observed following admin-
istration of these compounds in people with problematic
substance use.
Anti-depressant effects
Ketamine has emerged as a rapid acting and potent
antidepressant [42]. Similarly, a small open-label trial
with psilocybin has found preliminary evidence of effica-
cy following a single dose in treatment-resistant de-
pressed patients [43]. In healthy humans, individuals
have reported long-term increases in optimism following
LSD [43] and increases in wellbeing and openness fol-
lowing psilocybin administration [44,45].
Depression occurs very frequently in addiction and large
numbers of people with drug and alcohol problems have
depressive symptoms upon entry into detoxification pro-
grammes [46,47]. Depressive symptoms also have been
found to be a key factor in precipitating relapse in alcohol
[48]. Effects of psychedelics on depressive symptoms
may explain some of their treatment effects in addiction.
Psychedelic drugs may also switch off or disrupt the brain
circuits involved in the ruminative style of thinking
observed both in depression and in problematic substance
use [49].
Neuroplasticity
One promising candidate neurobiological mechanism for
the lasting changes in behaviour seen following psyche-
delic and dissociative drugs is the stimulation of neuro-
plasticity, 
a 
mechanism 
common 
to 
both 
classic
hallucinogens and synthetic compounds like ketamine.
As ketamine is an NMDAR antagonist, it may seem
paradoxical that the drug boosts plasticity. But recent
work in animals also shows that ketamine-mediated
blockade of NMDARs, triggers a sequence of intracellu-
lar signalling, the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elonga-
tion factor 2 (eEF2) that results in a de-suppression of brain
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) translation [50–52].
Increased BDNF expression following NMDAR block-
ade by ketamine has been shown to potentiate synaptic
responses in the CA1 and dentate gyrus fields of the rat
and mouse hippocampus [52], areas crucial in learning
and memory. Ketamine has been demonstrated to in-
crease synaptic plasticity [53] and synaptogenesis [54] at
24 hours post-infusion in rats. Ketamine also persistently
enhances induction of long-term potentiation 24 hours
after injection and increases the NMDAR-NR2B concen-
tration on cell surface at rat hippocampus and medial
prefrontal cortex synapses in vitro [53]. Animal studies
show increased plasticity and learning at 24 hours post
infusion.
A limited number of studies have investigated these
processes in classical hallucinogens. Single dose adminis-
tration of LSD in rats induces gene transcription in the
prefrontal cortex associated with increased plasticity [55].
Additionally, existing studies in rats suggest that admin-
istration of DOI, a synthetic 5HT-2A agonist, enhances
BDNF in the parietal cortex [56] and produces a remo-
delling of pyramidal cells that transiently increases the
dendritic spine size in cortical neurons [57]. Furthermore,
ibogaine treatment reduces alcohol self-administration
rats and its effects are mediated by an increase in glial
cell line-neurotrophic factor [GDNF] expression [58].
Experiential changes
Across all these compounds, emerging data suggest that
the intensity of the subjective effects correlate with
reductions in substance use [12�,40,59]. These mystical
experiences have been described by various authors as an
experience of a reality surpassing normal human under-
standing or experience, especially a reality perceived as
essential to the nature of reality, feelings of unity and
interconnectedness, sacredness, peace and joy, distortion
of time and space perception [45,60,61]. Recent pilot
work giving psilocybin in nicotine addiction found that
mystical experiences were associated with a greater re-
duction in smoking [59] and in alcohol dependence, both
the intensity of subjective effects and mystical experi-
ence, were associated with greater improvements [12�].
The mystical element of the ketamine experience and
the intensity of this experience have been shown to
mediate motivation to quit using cocaine [41]. Important-
ly, there seems relative specificity for the mystical experi-
ences as predictors, therefore this is likely not just a non-
specific effect reflecting an individual’s sensitivity to the
drug. Psychologically, it has been suggested that the
psychedelic ‘spiritual awakening’, can give the individual
a different perspective on life and a sense of meaning
[62]. Long-term changes in a person’s outlook [44,45]
could be critical in helping to maintain abstinence.
Conclusions
Following years of hiatus, research into psychedelic drug
treatment has been reinvigorated and there is emerging

 evidence for the effectiveness of drugs like ketamine,
LSD and psilocybin in addiction, with full trials under-
way. In the next 5 years clearer evidence for the use of the
compounds should become available. Ayahuasca and
iboagine show promise from lower quality studies but
RCTs are needed and concerns about safety, in the case
of ibogaine, should be addressed.
Abuse potential of all of these compounds particularly
when used therapeutically appears to be low: the seroto-
nergic hallucinogens have not been associated with sub-
sequent 
addiction 
[12�] 
whereas 
ketamine 
and
dissociated anaesthetics have some potential for abuse,
although this has not been observed when it has been
used in therapeutic settings [34]. The therapeutic mech-
anisms of these drugs in addiction treatment remain
unclear but anti-depressant effects, and the consequent
stimulation of neuroplasticity, as well as positive psycho-
logical effects stemming from mystical experiences with
these drugs are candidates, and of course are not mutually
exclusive. This is an exciting time for research into
psychedelic drugs, the evidence reviewed here suggests
a potential place in modern medicine for these com-
pounds, if we are able to overcome the historical stigma
associated with this class of drugs and the immense
regulatory burden that their illegal schedule 1 status
imposes.
