Infections with Gram-negative pathogens pose a serious threat to
public health. This scenario is exacerbated by increases in antibi-
otic resistance and the limited availability of vaccines and thera-
peutic tools to combat these infections. Here, we report an
immunization approach that targets siderophores, which are small
molecules exported by enteric Gram-negative pathogens to ac-
quire iron, an essential nutrient, in the host. Because siderophores
are nonimmunogenic, we designed and synthesized conjugates of
a native siderophore and the immunogenic carrier protein cholera
toxin subunit B (CTB). Mice immunized with the CTB–siderophore
conjugate developed anti-siderophore antibodies in the gut mucosa,
and when mice were infected with the enteric pathogen Salmonella,
they exhibited reduced intestinal colonization and reduced systemic
dissemination of the pathogen. Moreover, analysis of the gut micro-
biota revealed that reduction of Salmonella colonization in the
inflamed gut was accompanied by expansion of Lactobacillus spp.,
which are beneficial commensal organisms that thrive in similar
locales as Enterobacteriaceae. Collectively, our results demonstrate
that anti-siderophore antibodies inhibit Salmonella colonization.
Because siderophore-mediated iron acquisition is a virulence trait
shared by many bacterial and fungal pathogens, blocking microbial
iron acquisition by siderophore-based immunization or other side-
rophore-targeted approaches may represent a novel strategy to pre-
vent and ameliorate a broad range of infections.

ram-negative pathogens cause a range of human diseases,
including foodborne illness, urinary tract infections, and sep-
sis. Infections with these organisms pose a serious global public
health threat that is exacerbated by increasing antibiotic resis-
tance, the dearth of new antibiotics in the drug pipeline, and the
limited availability of vaccines (1). To slow the emergence of anti-
biotic resistance and to reduce the incidence of secondary infec-
tions, narrow-spectrum therapeutic strategies are needed, specifically
ones that limit disruption of the gut microbiota, which comprises
beneficial microbes that provide colonization resistance to patho-
gens (2). Many studies have elucidated molecular mechanisms
by which pathogens thrive in the host, thus indicating potential
targets for the prevention and treatment of infection. In recent
years, bacterial metabolism has been proposed to be a key factor in
promoting pathogenicity (3).
The vast majority of bacterial pathogens have a metabolic
requirement for iron. Because the vertebrate host tightly controls
the concentration of free iron (e.g., ∼10−24 M in serum), many
microbes biosynthesize and export secondary metabolites called
siderophores to scavenge iron from the host (4). These small
molecules chelate ferric iron (Fe3+) with high affinity [e.g.,
enterobactin (Ent)] (5–8) (Kd ∼10−25 M at neutral pH; Fig. 1A).
Once a siderophore coordinates iron in the extracellular space,
the iron-bound siderophore is recognized and transported into
a microbial cell by a dedicated membrane receptor. Follow-
ing cellular uptake, the iron is released from the siderophore to
support microbial metabolism and replication. Siderophores are
regarded as major virulence factors during infection with bacterial
and fungal pathogens, examples of which include Salmonella
enterica, uropathogenic Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphy-
lococcus aureus, and Aspergillus fumigatus (9).
Ent (Fig. 1A) is a siderophore biosynthesized and deployed
by commensal and pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae (10). In a
process known as “nutritional immunity,” the host responds to
microbial infection and inflammation by limiting the availability
of essential nutrient metals, including iron (11). To prevent Ent-
mediated microbial iron acquisition, epithelial cells and neu-
trophils secrete the host-defense protein lipocalin-2 (LCN2).
This protein inhibits siderophore-mediated iron uptake by cap-
turing ferric Ent in the extracellular milieu (12). By inhibiting the
growth of Enterobacteriaceae that rely on Ent-mediated iron
acquisition, LCN2 plays an essential role in preventing lethal
infection by these organisms (12, 13). Nevertheless, various Gram-
negative pathogens evade LCN2 by producing and using “stealth
siderophores” that cannot be captured by this host-defense
protein. For example, Salmonella spp. and strains of pathogenic
Significance
Gram-negative pathogens represent a major public health is-
sue. With increases in antibiotic resistance and the limited
availability of preventive strategies, new ways are needed to
target these bacteria. Here, we propose a narrow-spectrum
immunization strategy to block the ability of a gastrointestinal
pathogen to acquire the essential metal nutrient iron. This
approach involves the chemical synthesis of bacterial iron
chelators, known as siderophores, and their conjugation to
immunogenic carrier proteins. Mice immunized with these
compounds developed antibodies against siderophores in the
intestine, which hindered proliferation of the gut pathogen
Salmonella. Because similar but distinct molecules are secreted
by many bacterial and fungal pathogens, this synthesis and
immunization strategy could be applied to a broad range of
infectious agents.

 E. coli overcome LCN2 by biosynthesizing a family of
C-glucosylated Ent (GlcEnt) derivatives named salmochelins
(14, 15) (Fig. 1A). These siderophores allow the pathogen to
thrive in the inflamed gut in the presence of LCN2 and outcompete
the microbiota (14–16). Indeed, Salmonella mutants that lack the
GlcEnt receptor IroN are susceptible to the LCN2-mediated
host response; these mutants exhibit reduced colonization in the
inflamed intestine and cannot outcompete the microbiota (17,
18). In the absence of intestinal inflammation or LCN2 expres-
sion, iron is more readily available and mutants in siderophore
receptors are not attenuated (19).
Inspired by seminal studies exemplifying the importance of
siderophore-mediated iron acquisition during infection with
Salmonella as well as other pathogens (18, 20), we hypothesized
that boosting host nutritional immunity by blocking siderophore-
based iron acquisition would reduce microbial burden and im-
prove the outcome of infection. To address this hypothesis, we
designed and synthesized conjugates of a native siderophore
used by Salmonella and an immunogenic carrier protein, and
we immunized mice with the compounds to induce an antibody
response against siderophores. Herein, we show that immuni-
zation of mice with the siderophore-carrier protein conjugate
elicited an antibody response to siderophores in the intestinal
mucosa and significantly reduced Salmonella colonization of
the inflamed gut.
Results and Discussion
Immunization with Siderophore Conjugates Elicits a Mucosal Antibody
Response. To induce the development of an antibody response
against siderophores, we selected cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)
as the immunogenic carrier protein because it induces a strong
mucosal immune response (21). We reasoned that immunizing
mice with a CTB–siderophore conjugate should result in the pro-
duction of anti-siderophore antibodies in the gut mucosa, which
is the primary site of Salmonella infection. Because Ent and
GlcEnt (Fig. 1A; 1 and 2, respectively) share several structural
features, including the catechol moieties and trilactone ring, and
GlcEnt is a derivative of Ent, we hypothesized that immunization
with CTB-Ent would elicit an antibody response against both Ent
and GlcEnt. In addition, it could be difficult to elicit a specific
antibody response to only one of these siderophores given the
shared structural attributes. Although Ent is captured by LCN2
in the inflamed gut, we also reasoned that the development of
antibodies that capture both Ent and GlcEnt would be advan-
tageous, especially if LCN2 levels are low in response to in-
fection, for instance, in immunocompromised patients (22).

MICROBIOLOGY
CHEMISTRY
 We thus designed and prepared a CTB-Ent conjugate that
harbors the native Ent scaffold. We assembled CTB-Ent (Fig.
1A, 3) from CTB and intermediate 8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), an
Ent derivative monofunctionalized with a polyethylene glycol
(PEG3) linker using standard amide coupling methods (Fig. 1A
and SI Appendix, Figs. S1–S3 and Supplementary Discussion).
This procedure results in the Ent haptens covalently attached to
surface-exposed lysine residues of CTB via the PEG3 linker (Fig.
1A). The average number of Ent-labeled lysine residues is ap-
proximately equal to four out of nine surface-exposed lysine
residues in one subunit of CTB (SI Appendix, Supplementary
Discussion). We selected a PEG3 linker because it is stable and
affords both flexibility and enhanced solubility in aqueous solu-
tion (23). In prior work, we modified the native Ent scaffold with
a PEG3 linker and established that these molecules coordinate
Fe3+ and are recognized and transported by the Ent receptor
FepA (23, 24). From these prior studies, we reasoned that an-
tibodies that bind the Ent moiety of CTB-Ent will also recognize
and bind unmodified Ent.
We immunized mice at day 0 and boosted at day 14 (Fig. 1B)
by intranasal administration of either unmodified CTB (100 μg per
mouse, mock immunization) or CTB-Ent (100 μg per mouse). To
determine whether mice immunized with CTB-Ent developed a
specific antibody response against Ent, blood and fecal samples
were collected weekly for detection of anti-Ent antibodies by using
an in-house ELISA and dot-blot. As expected, the amount of total
fecal IgA was similar between the two groups of mice (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S4A). However, only mice immunized with CTB-Ent
developed specific fecal IgA antibodies that recognized Ent (Fig. 1
C and D and SI Appendix, Fig. S4B), which were undetectable
before immunization (day 0; Fig. 1C). The production of fecal
anti-Ent IgA significantly increased at day 21 postimmunization
in mice immunized with CTB-Ent (Fig. 1 C and D). An enzyme-
linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay confirmed that mice
immunized with CTB-Ent developed B cells secreting antigen-
specific antibodies against Ent in the Peyer’s patches (Fig. 1E).
We next investigated whether the mucosal IgA elicited by
CTB-Ent immunization would also recognize GlcEnt. Consistent
with our expectation based on the structural attributes shared by
Ent and GlcEnt (Fig. 1A), fecal IgA from mice immunized with
CTB-Ent also recognized GlcEnt (Fig. 1 F and G and SI Appendix,
Fig. S4B). This immunization appeared to trigger mucosal im-
munity to Ent and GlcEnt specifically. In conjunction with the
detection of specific fecal anti-Ent and anti-GlcEnt antibodies
(Fig. 1 C–G), we detected specific fecal anti-CTB IgA in mice
immunized with CTB-Ent; however, anti-CTB IgA was also de-
tected in mice immunized with unmodified CTB, as expected (Fig.
1H). Moreover, IgA that recognized unmodified CTB was secreted
by B cells isolated from the Peyer’s patches in both groups of mice
(Fig. 1I). We found no evidence for the production of anti-Ent/
GlcEnt IgG in the spleen or blood of mice immunized with CTB-
Ent, even though we detected IgG and IgA recognizing un-
modified CTB in the spleen (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C). Additionally,
the mucosal response to the CTB-Ent antigen was independent of
the route of immunization. Mice immunized i.p. with CTB-Ent
also developed B cells secreting anti-Ent/GlcEnt IgA in the Peyer’s
patches, but not antibodies recognizing these antigens in the
spleen (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 A and B). We thus conclude that our
immunization strategy generates mucosal IgA that recognize Ent
and GlcEnt. These results are in agreement with the known effects
of CTB in boosting mucosal immunity (25).
Immunization with Siderophore Conjugates Results in Lower
Intestinal and Systemic Colonization of an Enteric Pathogen. Once
we established the antibody response, we investigated whether
the production of anti-Ent/GlcEnt IgA would limit gut coloni-
zation and systemic dissemination of Salmonella. We used the
mouse model of Salmonella colitis and infected mice (C57BL/6)
that are highly susceptible to the pathogen (26). Groups of 10–20
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences and im-
munized with either CTB or CTB-Ent. Subsequently, the mice were
treated with a single oral dose of streptomycin, followed by in-
fection with 109 cfu per mouse of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium.
In the mouse model, pretreatment with streptomycin is necessary
for development of cecal and colonic inflammation during Salmo-
nella infection (27). The transient alteration of the microbiota (28),
accompanied by the increase in inducible NOS (iNOS) production
(29), renders mice more prone to colitis. In this model, the devel-
opment of intestinal inflammation and the recruitment of neutro-
phils to the gut peak at day 3–4 postinfection. We previously
demonstrated that iron is limited in the inflamed gut at these time
points (18, 19) and that Salmonella uses GlcEnt to evade iron se-
questration by LCN2 and thereby thrive in this environment and
outcompete the microbiota (18).
At both days 1 and 2 postinfection, when levels of inflamma-
tion are low and iron is more abundant, we observed similar
levels of Salmonella colonization in the feces of mice immunized
with CTB or with CTB-Ent (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S6A).
In contrast, we found a significant reduction of Salmonella in the
feces of mice immunized with CTB-Ent at day 3, and especially in
the cecum content at day 4, postinfection (Fig. 2A). These time
points correspond to the peak of inflammatory response and of
iron limitation during Salmonella infection (18, 19). Salmonella
colonization was lower in mice with the highest anti-Ent antibody
titer, with some mice showing a 20,000-fold reduction of Salmo-
nella in the cecal content (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that
our immunization strategy successfully hindered the growth ad-
vantage of Salmonella in the inflamed gut.
Salmonella colonization of the terminal ileum and Peyer’s
patches (Fig. 2 C and D), but not of the mesenteric lymph nodes
(SI Appendix, Fig. S6D), was also reduced in mice immunized
with CTB-Ent. Moreover, mice immunized with CTB-Ent
exhibited reduced weight loss (Fig. 2E) and reduced Salmonella
burden in the spleen (Fig. 2F) compared with mock-immunized
mice, indicating that CTB-Ent immunization also slows disease
progression. Because C57BL/6 mice are very susceptible to lethal
infection by Salmonella, all mock-immunized mice had to be
euthanized at day 4 because of marked weight loss and high
bacterial burden (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). In contrast, mice im-
munized with CTB-Ent exhibited less severe weight loss (Fig. 2E)
and could survive infection for two additional days (SI Appendix,
Fig. S6A). Moreover, when mice were immunized i.p. with CTB-
Ent, we observed similar reductions of Salmonella colonization
of the gut and of the spleen (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 C and D).
To ensure that the success of our immunization strategy was
independent of housing conditions and differences in the gut
microbiota, we immunized and infected mice from two colonies
bred in our vivarium. The first colony consisted of conventional
C57BL/6 mice, and the second colony consisted of C57BL/6 mice
engineered to express functional natural resistance-associated
macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) (30). In our hands, these
C57BL/6 NRAMP1+ mice survive up to 8–9 d postinfection.
Analogous to the mice purchased from Taconic, the C57BL/6
mice from the first colony produced anti-Ent IgA in the Peyer’s
patches and exhibited reduced Salmonella colonization in the
feces at day 4 postinfection (SI Appendix, Fig. S6E). Moreover, in
the C57BL/6 NRAMP1+ mice, we observed a significant re-
duction in Salmonella burden in the cecum at day 8 postinfection
as a result of CTB-Ent immunization (SI Appendix, Fig. S6F).
Taken together, these results indicate that our immunization
strategy was reproducible in different mouse lines.
Based on our findings suggesting that anti-Ent/GlcEnt IgA
produced in response to CTB-Ent immunization sequesters
GlcEnt in the gut lumen, we evaluated whether the competitive
advantage of wild-type Salmonella over a mutant in the GlcEnt
receptor IroN is reduced in mice immunized with CTB-Ent. We

Sassone-Corsi et al.
 have previously shown that the iroN mutant is defective in col-
onization of the inflamed gut, where LCN2 is highly induced
(18). Moreover, the iroN mutant is outcompeted by Salmonella
wild-type 10- to 100-fold during intestinal inflammation (18). We
reasoned that anti-Ent/GlcEnt IgA produced in response to
CTB-Ent immunization would bind to GlcEnt in the gut lumen,
thereby inhibiting growth of wild-type Salmonella. Consistent
with our hypothesis, the competitive advantage of wild-type
Salmonella over the iroN mutant was significantly reduced by
∼10-fold in mice immunized with CTB-Ent (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6C). These results further support the model that sequestration
of GlcEnt by specific IgA contributes to the reduction of Sal-
monella colonization in mice immunized with CTB-Ent.
Pathology and Inflammation Are Similar in Mice Immunized with
Either Carrier Proteins or Siderophore Conjugates. Because Salmo-
nella thrives in the inflamed gut and benefits from inflammatory
responses from the host during infection (31), we questioned
whether the lower Salmonella levels in the colon content resulted
from reduced inflammation in mice immunized with CTB-Ent
(32, 33). Blinded histological analysis ruled out this possibility
because similar levels of intestinal inflammation were observed
in mock-immunized and CTB-Ent–immunized mice upon Sal-
monella infection (Fig. 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S6B).
Moreover, several inflammatory markers, including genes encod-
ing LCN2, interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-22, CXCL1, Ly-6G, and
iNOS, were similarly up-regulated in both groups of mice after
infection (Fig. 3 C and D). Taken together, these results demon-
strate that lower levels of Salmonella gut colonization occurred in
mice immunized with CTB-Ent despite similarly high levels of
intestinal inflammation.
Lactobacillus spp. Expand in the Context of Diminished Salmonella
Intestinal Colonization. One consequence of intestinal inflamma-
tion, whether induced by Salmonella infection or by other in-
fectious and noninfectious etiologies, is a profound alteration of
the gut microbiota, termed “dysbiosis.” The highly oxidative en-
vironment in the inflamed gut (34) reduces the growth of obligate
anaerobes, such as Bacteroidetes and Clostridiales, which consti-
tute ∼99% of microbes in the normal, noninflamed gut. In con-
trast, inflammation promotes the bloom of Enterobacteriaceae,
which usually constitute less than 1% of the microbiota in the
absence of intestinal inflammation (35). Commensal and patho-
genic facultative anaerobes, including Salmonella, can respire
novel electron acceptors (e.g., nitrate, tetrathionate) that only
become available in the inflamed gut, thus outcompeting the res-
ident microbiota (36, 37). Moreover, acquisition of metal ions,
including iron in the inflamed gut, enhances the capability of
Salmonella to thrive in this environment (38). Because we ob-
served lower levels of Salmonella in mice immunized with CTB-
Ent (Fig. 2A), we questioned the impact of our immunization
strategy on the microbiota in the inflamed gut. In particular, we
sought to identify which bacterial species thrive in the inflamed gut
when Salmonella growth was hindered by CTB-Ent immunization.
The composition of the gut microbiota was not significantly
different in mice that were immunized with either CTB or CTB-
Ent at 36–51 d postimmunization (Fig. 4A and SI Appendix, Tables
S1 and S2). The microbiota in these mice was largely composed of

MICROBIOLOGY
CHEMISTRY
 Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, whereas Proteobacteria (Proteus
and Desulfovibrio) constituted only a small fraction of the gut
microbiota (SI Appendix, Table S1). Overall, the microbiota
composition in these mice was comparable to prior studies in naive
mice in the absence of intestinal inflammation (32).
In agreement with earlier studies in naive mice (32), we found
that Salmonella infection induced a significant decrease in bac-
terial diversity at day 4 postinfection in mice immunized with
either CTB or CTB-Ent (Fig. 4A and SI Appendix, Table S2). As
observed previously in naive mice (32), Salmonella constituted an
average of 50% of the gut microbes in mock-immunized mice
(Fig. 4 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Notably, this value
dropped to an average of 15% in mice immunized with CTB-Ent
(Fig. 4 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S7), which was in accord
with the reduction of Salmonella cecal colony-forming units in
these mice (Fig. 2A). Commensal Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Proteus
spp.) increased only slightly in CTB-immunized mice during Sal-
monella infection. This result agrees with prior studies (32), which
showed that Salmonella outcompetes other Proteobacteria in the
inflamed gut. Moreover, commensal Enterobacteriaceae did not
expand in the inflamed gut of mice immunized with CTB-Ent 4 d
after Salmonella infection. Because all Enterobacteriaceae that
experience conditions of iron limitation deploy Ent to acquire this
nutrient, we reason that the production of anti-Ent IgA limits the
expansion of this family in the inflamed gut by sequestering this
common siderophore.
Because of the similarly high levels of intestinal inflammation
(Fig. 3), most other bacterial genera were similarly affected
during Salmonella infection in both groups of mice (Fig. 4C and
SI Appendix, Table S1). However, we detected a significant
expansion of Lactobacillus spp. in the inflamed gut of mice im-
munized with CTB-Ent (50% of the microbiota), but not in CTB-
immunized mice (15% of the microbiota) (Fig. 4 B and C and SI
Appendix, Fig. S7). These results are in agreement with previous
findings showing that Lactobacillus spp. also replicate in a similar
inflamed environment as Enterobacteriaceae and also benefit
from inflammation, albeit by unknown mechanisms (32). Con-
sistent with this idea, Lactobacillus was recently shown to expand
during noninfectious colitis and to up-regulate TonB-dependent
receptor components in the inflamed gut, suggesting that this
genus can also acquire essential metal nutrients in this environ-
ment (39). Importantly, Lactobacillus spp. are considered bene-
ficial microbes, and a few species are even administered as
therapeutic agents (40). By reducing Salmonella colonization
without reducing intestinal inflammation, it appears that our
immunization strategy indirectly promoted the expansion of
beneficial microbes that also thrive in the inflamed gut, thereby
providing additional benefits to the host.
Summary and Conclusions
For many years, siderophores, as well as the biosynthetic and
transport machineries for these virulence factors, have garnered
significant interest as targets for new antibiotics. Reported efforts
include the design and application of siderophore–antibiotic con-
jugates for targeted drug delivery, the identification of small-
molecule inhibitors of siderophore biosynthesis, and the inhibition
of siderophore uptake by immunization against siderophore re-
ceptors or siderophores (9, 41–43). A prior study described the
development of antibodies against vibriobactin; however, that
study did not evaluate whether the vaccination provided protection
to the host during infection with Vibrio cholerae (44). Our work
establishes that immunization against bacterial siderophores re-
sults in the production of anti-siderophore antibodies and af-
fords reduced intestinal colonization (up to 20,000-fold) during
infection with the enteric pathogen Salmonella. These results are
particularly significant because Salmonella is known to thrive in
the inflamed gut and to outcompete the microbiota in this en-
vironment. Our immunization shifted the balance in favor of the
microbiota, promoting the expansion of beneficial microbes (e.g.,
Lactobacillus) that thrive in a similar environment. Moreover,
because only mice that shed the highest level of Salmonella (the so-
called “supershedders”) are able to achieve successful transmission
of the pathogen to naive hosts (45), we reason that our strategy,
which reduces fecal shedding, could be used to hinder Salmonella
transmission. Because Salmonella intestinal colonization was most
highly reduced in mice that developed the highest antibody titers,
future studies will address further optimization of the immuniza-
tion strategy to increase antibody production.
In contrast to the mouse model, nontyphoidal Salmonella re-
mains localized to the gut in most patients. We predict that anti-
siderophore antibodies, either generated in the gut in response to
immunization or therapeutically administered to patients infected
with Salmonella, could reduce fecal shedding of the pathogen,
thereby limiting its spread and reducing recovery time. Moreover,
future immunization studies aimed at generating a systemic anti-
body response to siderophores in mice will determine whether this
strategy could lead to greater protection at systemic sites, which
would be informative for developing new preventive or therapeutic
strategies for systemic salmonellosis.
This immunization strategy could be further developed as a
therapy for infections caused by pathogens that use other side-
rophores to thrive in the mammalian host. We expect that de-
velopment of resistance against antibody-based immunization
would develop only if a new siderophore biosynthesis gene

 cluster is acquired by horizontal gene transfer, and future studies
will address this notion. In principle, our strategy can be applied
to every siderophore, which would be useful in the event that
resistance develops, or to target pathogens that use more than
one siderophore. Moreover, the development of anti-siderophore
antibodies will likely provide narrow-spectrum antimicrobial ac-
tivity by targeting only microbes that use that subset of side-
rophores while having a minimal impact on the microbiota (in
contrast to broad- and even narrow-spectrum antibiotics). Broadly,
our work indicates that new preventive and therapeutic strategies
for microbial infections should target siderophore-mediated iron
acquisition, a virulence trait shared by almost all bacterial and
fungal pathogens (9). Moreover, because recent studies dem-
onstrate additional, nonclassical roles for siderophores (46, 47),
including protection of bacteria from oxidative stress (48) and
modulation of host gene expression (49), it is possible that
antibody-mediated sequestration of siderophores may inhibit
bacterial growth by iron-independent mechanisms and may
provide additional benefits to the host.
Methods
The preparation and characterization of CTB-Ent, Ent-PEG3-biotin, GlcEnt-
PEG3-biotin, and native siderophores are described in SI Appendix. Six- to
eight-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were purchased from Taconic. When
indicated, 6- to 8-wk-old male or female C57BL/6 or C57BL/6 NRAMP1+ mice
bred in our vivarium were also used for the experiments; 8 to 10 mice per
experimental group were used for each experiment. The Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Irvine approved
all of the mouse experiments. Mucosal immunization with CTB, CTB-Ent
conjugates, analysis of antibody production by ELISA and ELISPOT, infection
models, histopathology, and analysis of gene expression and of the micro-
biota are described in SI Appendix.
