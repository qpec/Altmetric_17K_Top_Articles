Hurricane Season Public Health Preparedness, Response, and Recovery 
Guidance for Health Care Providers, Response and Recovery Workers, and 
Affected Communities — CDC, 2017
CDC 2017 Hurricane Incident Management System Team1
On September 13, 2017, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 
Registry (ATSDR) have guidance and technical materials 
available in both English and Spanish to help communities 
prepare for hurricanes and floods (Table 1). To help protect 
the health and safety of the public, responders, and clean-up 
workers during response and recovery operations from hur-
ricanes and floods, CDC and ATSDR have developed public 
health guidance and other resources; many are available in 
both English and Spanish (Table 2).
Hurricane Harvey made landfall on the Texas coast on 
August 25, 2017, as a Category 4 storm. In southeast Texas, 
record rainfall caused extensive flooding and damage to public 
infrastructure and communities, and displaced thousands of 
persons. As of September 12, 2017, the media have reported 
>80 storm-related deaths attributed to Hurricane Harvey 
(medical examiner confirmation is pending for some deaths). 
Most of these deaths likely were caused by drowning in flood 
waters within the first few days after impact (e.g., drowning 
at home or in vehicles).
On September 7, 2017, a Category 5 hurricane, Irma, 
reached the Lesser Antilles, including the U.S. territories of 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Hurricane Irma then con-
tinued its path across the Greater Antilles and made landfall in 
south Florida on September 10, 2017. Irma’s hurricane-force 
winds and related storm surges caused substantial damage in 
the Caribbean and Florida.
Many areas in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, and the 
U.S. territories affected by these storms are still experiencing 
disruptions in essential services, including electricity, potable 
water, food, and communications. Numerous health care and 
public health systems sustained damage. Environmental health 
impacts from the hurricanes included effects on industries, 
chemical plants, and hazardous waste sites. Many displaced 
persons remain in shelters or other temporary housing.
As part of the overall U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services response and recovery operations, CDC and 
ATSDR are supporting public health and medical care func-
tions for affected communities and persons displaced by the 
hurricanes. As of September 12, 2017, CDC and ATSDR had 
sent pharmacy and federal medical station supplies to Texas, 
Louisiana, and Florida. CDC and ATSDR have also activated 
and deployed members of the U.S. Public Health Service 
Commissioned Corps and other personnel to provide technical 
support for critical public health functions. Field operations 
and the CDC and ATSDR Emergency Operations Center are 
supporting mortality and morbidity surveillance; public health 
messaging and risk communication; water, sanitation, safety, 
and facility assessments; community rapid needs assessments; 
mold abatement; industrial and residential contaminant expo-
sure prevention; and vector control.
There are potential public health and safety concerns after 
hurricane impact. Many injuries and illnesses from hurricanes 
and floods occur during the response and recovery phases. 
Common hazards include vehicle- and nonvehicle-related 
drowning, carbon monoxide poisoning (e.g., from any 
gasoline-powered engine, including generators and clean-up 
equipment), electrocution, falls, lacerations, and exposure to 
mold and industrial and household chemicals (1–8). In addi-
tion, exacerbation of existing chronic conditions and develop-
ment of acute mental health symptoms are frequent reasons 
for seeking health care services following a disaster (9–11). 
Guidance and other resources to assist in addressing many of 
these hazards and risk are available (Table 2).
CDC and ATSDR also offer a disaster response clinical con-
sultation service to assist health care providers, public health 
professionals, and emergency response partners. This service 
can be accessed by emailing CDC IMS Clinical Inquiries at 
eocevent168@cdc.gov.
For additional assistance, health care providers, public 
health professionals, and members of the public can also use 
CDC and ATSDR’s information service, CDC-INFO. Live 
agents provide up-to-date science-based health information. 
CDC-INFO can be reached Monday through Friday from 
8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time at 1–800-CDC-INFO 
(1–800–232–4636) or by submitting a web-based form 
(https://wwwn.cdc.gov/dcs/ContactUs/Form). Services are 
available in English and Spanish.
