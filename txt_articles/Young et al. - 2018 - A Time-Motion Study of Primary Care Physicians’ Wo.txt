A 
survey by the Office of the Na-
tional Coordinator for Health 
Information Technology in 
2014 reported that 87% of prima-
ry care physicians used electron-
ic health records (EHRs).1 Reviews 
of the effect of EHRs on patient 
and physician outcomes have been 
mixed, including neutral to small 
positive effects on common quality 
metrics and disease-specific guide-
lines,2-5 mixed on office workflow,2,6,7 
and mostly decreased on primary 
care physician productivity
.8-10 There 
is little to no evidence that patient 
outcomes are improved or overall 
health care costs are reduced.4,11
Major studies of the work US fam-
ily physicians perform in their clinic 
have been published, but all before 
the national growth of EHRs.12-24 Al-
though several studies of the impact 
of EHRs on physician work report 
an effect on time as a percentage of 
their work day, almost no previous 
studies measured the actual time 
spent. A recent study of four types 
of physicians found that 27% of their 
time was spent in clinical face-to-
face time with the patient and 49% 
of their time was spent using the 
EHR and other deskwork.25 Heavy 
EHR use in primary care is associ-
ated with increased time pressure, 
increased physician stress, and de-
creased job satisfaction.26
Previous studies have shown 
that for a mostly middle-aged, in-
sured population, family physicians 
address 2.5 to 3.1 issues in the av-
erage clinic visit.12,15,16 The average 
number of issues per visit grows to 
3.9 to 6 for elderly patients and 4.6 
for patients with diabetes.16,24 Multi-
ple issues are not likely to get equal 
attention. Other research observed 
that primary care physicians in 
clinic only spend 1 minute on oth-
er patient concerns after the chief

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Electronic health records (EHRs) have had 
mixed effects on the workflow of ambulatory primary care. In this study, we 
update previous research on the time required to care for patients in primary 
care clinics with EHRs. 
METHODS: We directly observed family physician (FP) attendings, residents, 
and their ambulatory patients in 982 visits in clinics affiliated with 10 residen-
cies of the Residency Research Network of Texas. The FPs were purposely cho-
sen to reflect a diversity of patient care styles. We measured total visit time, 
previsit chart time, face-to-face time, non-face time, out-of-hours EHR work time, 
and total EHR work time. 
RESULTS: The mean (SD) visit length was 35.8 (16.6) minutes, not counting 
resident precepting time. The mean time components included 2.9 (3.8) min-
utes working in the EHR prior to entering the room, 16.5 (9.2) minutes of face-
to-face time not working in the EHR, 2.0 (2.1) minutes working in the EHR in 
the room (which occurred in 73.4% of the visits), 7.5 (7.5) minutes of non-face 
time (mostly EHR time), and 6.9 (7.6) minutes of EHR work outside of normal 
clinic operational hours (which occurred in 64.6% of the visits). The total time 
and total EHR time varied only slightly between faculty physicians, third-year 
and second-year residents. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed 
many factors associated with total visit time including patient, physician, and 
clinic infrastructure factors. 
CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians spent more time working in the EHR 
than they spent in face-to-face time with patients in clinic visits.

complaint is addressed.24 This time 
crunch is associated with reduced 
provision of common chronic disease 
services when multiple patient con-
cerns are addressed.27
The purpose of our study was to 
update measures of the time prima-
ry care physicians require to care for 
ambulatory patients in clinics, to 
measure how much time was spent 
working in the EHR, and to deter-
mine the other patient, physician, 
and visit characteristics associated 
with these time measures.
Methods
Study Population
This was a cross-sectional, observa-
tional study in clinics of 10 family 
medicine residency programs that 
are members of the Residency Re-
search Network of Texas (RRNeT). 
Observer Training and 
Measurements
Visit observers/data collectors (“ob-
servers”) were medical students and 
one premed undergraduate student. 
Each volunteered to participate in 
a 4-week research elective during a 
normal break in their primary class 
schedule. Investigators scheduled a 
1-day orientation and training ses-
sion at the medical school in San 
Antonio to teach enrollment and 
consent procedures, and review all 
sections of the instrument. Prior to 
the training, one investigator filmed 
physician-patient interactions (both 
complex and simple visits) and used 
these during training so the observ-
ers could practice recording perti-
nent data. The investigator-trainers 
provided feedback to insure con-
sistent data collection approaches 
among all observers.
This study used a visit survey to 
describe each patient’s visit in mul-
tiple domains. The primary instru-
ment was based on the National 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
(NAMCS), which includes the reason 
for visit, new or continuing/follow-
up patient, patient demographics, di-
agnoses, screening services, exams, 
medicines, procedures, nonmedical 
treatments, and referral patterns.28 
Unlike NAMCS, there were no nu-
merical limits on any of the catego-
ries in our study.
Observers were instructed to re-
cord all concerns brought up in the 
visit by either the patient or physi-
cian. These could include symptoms, 
diagnoses, socioeconomic concerns, 
health care system issues, or even 
concerns about people other than 
the patient (for example, a ques-
tion about a child’s health during 
an adult’s scheduled visit). These 
concerns were recorded in a section 
entitled Reasons for Visit (RFV), 
which mirrored the NAMCS instru-
ment. Observers were also asked to 
record all of the concerns that were 
actually addressed by the physician 
during the visit (issues addressed), 
which also mirrors the NAMCS in-
strument. The investigator-trainers 
provided training on how to make 
this distinction during the session. 
For example, a patient may have 
mentioned a recent headache, but 
the physician spent no observed 
time taking a history of the head-
ache or prescribing a medication for 
the headache. In this scenario, the 
headache would be recorded in the 
RFV section, but not the Issues Ad-
dressed (IA) section. 
Observations
Patient-physician visits were pur-
posely sampled at the level of the 
observed physician. A true random-
ization of physicians was impracti-
cal given the nature of their clinic 
schedules. However, observers were 
instructed to shadow as wide a va-
riety of physicians as possible, and 
to preferentially observe FP faculty 
whenever possible, followed by third- 
or second-year residents. Data collec-
tion occurred in May and June 2015, 
toward the end of the academic year, 
which meant that observed residents 
had 2 and 3 full years of clinical ex-
perience.
Observers recorded data from al-
ternate patient visits to allow time 
to complete the lengthy study instru-
ments and to decrease the burden of 
their presence on the observed phy-
sician. Observers were instructed to 
be a “fly on the wall” and to impact 
the encounter as little as possible. 
They were instructed to move to the 
corner of the examination room that 
was the least visible to the patient. 
A crucial component of data collec-
tion was the time required for the 
physician to complete the encoun-
ter, both face-to-face time and non-
face time. Observers were instructed 
to not make any statements or ask 
the physician any questions until he 
or she was finished with that visit, 
and was ready to see the next pa-
tient. While the physician was see-
ing the nonobserved patient, the 
observer would complete recording 
relevant data on paper copies of the 
instruments and await the next el-
igible patient. The observer would 
explain the nature of the study and 
seek verbal consent from the patient 
and furnish a 1-page information-
al letter (signed consent was not re-
quired). If the patient declined to be 
observed, the next eligible patient 
was approached. At the end of each 
half-day clinic session, the observer 
transferred the written data onto a 
web-based version of the instrument 
through Survey Monkey.
Time Measurement
Observers used personal watches or 
cell phones to record time data. If 
documentation and other adminis-
trative work was incomplete at the 
end of the clinic session, the observ-
ers asked the physician to estimate 
how much time he or she would 
spend documenting in the EHR for 
each patient outside of clinic hours. 
A study investigator followed up 
with each student to inquire about 
their judgment of whether the esti-
mated times seemed reasonable and 
consistent given their observation of 
each physician’s documentation style 
and computer skills. Every observer 
reported that estimated times were 
consistent with observed behaviors 
and were unlikely to exaggerate the 
actual time spent.
Data Analysis
Results were analyzed using descrip-
tive statistics. Group comparisons of

continuous variables were assessed 
using independent samples t-tests 
or analysis of variance (ANOVA) as 
appropriate, and comparisons of all 
categorical data were analyzed using 
chi square. Bivariate correlation co-
efficients were calculated to identify 
variables that potentially predicted 
the time outcomes. Those that had 
a P value of < .20 were included in 
the multivariable linear regression 
models to identify independent 
predictors of time outcomes. SPSS 
(Statistical Package for the Social 
Scientist) version 20 was used for 
analysis (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All 
tests were 2-tailed, and alpha levels 
were set at 0.05 to determine statis-
tical significance.
The project was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
at the University of Texas Health 
Science Center at San Antonio and 
each of the participating residencies.
Results
We observed 982 clinic visits. Char-
acteristics of the patients and physi-
cians are shown in Table 1. 
In 982 physician-patient visits, 
the mean (SD) visit length was 35.8 
(16.6) minutes, not counting resi-
dent precepting time. The mean time

seeing residents. One faculty-only 
clinic had notably longer mean visit 
times even when corrected for fac-
tors such as patient demographics 
and the number of issues addressed 
per clinic visit. When it was removed 
from the analysis, the average fac-
ulty time was reduced by 3 minutes 
(35.3 [18.7] min, P=.01 for the dif-
ferent physician types). There was 
no consistent pattern of mean total 
EHR time by clinical experience, oth-
er than the longest time was spent 
by second year residents (20.4 min-
utes per visit, Table 3). In gener-
al, physicians who had completed 
residency training spent less pre-
visit time and less EHR time, but 
more face-to-face time. 
Multivariable linear regression 
analysis revealed many factors as-
sociated with visit times, including

tem factors (Table 4). These times

were adjusted to remove precepting 
time for patients seen by residents. 
The single largest contributor to to-
tal time and non-face time was still 
whether or not the resident checked 
out the patient with a preceptor. This 
factor did not impact face-to-face 
time with the patient. Other impor-
tant contributors included if the pa-
tient was new to the practice and the 
number of reasons for the visit the 
patient stated. Time use as a func-
tion of the number of issues the phy-
sician addressed is shown in Figure 
1. Two important notes apply to the 
figure First, the number of reasons 
for the visit and the number of is-
sues the physician addressed were 
almost exactly colinear. Issues ad-
dressed is reported here for brevi-
ty
. Secondly
, in the linear regression, 
there was a significant interaction 
with a dummy variable at six to 
seven visits, which is why two sepa-
rate linear regressions are shown. 
Other patient and physician factors 
were mostly noncontributory. Years 
of physician experience had little im-
pact on any of the time measures.
Discussion
We found that family physicians 
spent more time in direct ambu-
latory patient care working in the 
EHR than they spent in face-to-face 
time with their patients. The ma-
jority of family physicians worked 
through lunch, stayed late at clinic, 
or took their work home to complete 
the day’s EHR work. Significant pre-
dictors of visit length included the 
number of reasons for the visit, new 
patients to the practice, the number 
of medications prescribed, whether 
the physician was Hispanic, wheth-
er a resident physician presented 
the patient to an attending physi-
cian, whether the patient had one or 
multiple physicians caring for him or 
her, and a few other factors.
Our results of the time spent by 
the physicians working in the EHR 
are similar to a recent study that 
used EHR time stamp data from 
471 primary care physicians.29 They 
found physicians logged an average 
of 3.08 hours on office visits and 3.17 
hours on “desktop medicine” each 
day, which is similar to the ratio we 
measured. They also noted a trend 
from 2011 to 2014 of declining time 
allocated to face-to-face visits, accom-
panied by increasing time allocated 
to desktop medicine.
Our measurements of the face-
to-face time are similar to previ-
ous studies from the pre-EHR era.

Management rules were introduced, 
direct observational studies mea-
sured between 13.4 and 19.3 minutes 
of mean face-to-face time,15,17,18,23,24,30,31 
which is similar to our result of 18.5 
minutes. Our result is at the high 
end of this range, which may be ex-
plained by including resident physi-
cians, additional EHR time in the 
exam room (2.0 minutes per visit), 
and more issues addressed per vis-
it than most of the previous stud-
ies. All US results stand in contrast 
to a recent study in the UK, where 
the average general practitioner 
consultation included 9.5 minutes 
of face-to-face time and 3.3 minutes 
of EHR time.32 The UK results are 
consistent with observed consulta-
tion times across six countries in 
Europe in 2002 of 7.6 to 15.6 min-
utes total (overall mean, 10.7 min-
utes).33 Our results imply that US 
FPs spend more time working in the 
EHR than their European counter-
parts spend in the entire visit.
Strengths of our study included 
the direct observation of physician 
work and the comprehensive na-
ture of our data collection. Potential 
weaknesses of our study include 
the fact that observers had 1 day of 
training, visits were not recorded to 
check for intra-observer agreement, 
time allocation was only kept to the 
minute (other studies broke down 
time into 15 second increments), ob-
servations included many residents 
and did not include physicians in pri-
vate practice, and the ever-present 
Hawthorne effect. Further analysis 
(not fully reported here) found that 
most time or other related differenc-
es (eg, number of issues addressed) 
were explained by differences in pa-
tient demographics across the sites. 
Another weakness is that the times 
reported for working in the EHR 
outside of normal clinic hours were 
estimated, not observed directly. All 
observers believed the times estimat-
ed by the participating physicians 
were consistent with time elements 
they did observe, and that none of 
the physicians estimated times un-
realistically. The mean out-of-hours 
time comprised only 19% of the to-
tal visit time.
Our study successfully captured 
the work performed by the physician 
for each observed patient. We did not 
attempt to capture physician work 
devoted to other patients not seen 
that day
. A recent estimate was that 
13% of a family physician’s time is 
spent coordinating care among dif-
ferent physicians and other health 
care providers, such as physical ther-
apists and home health agencies.34 
Other studies found that 39 to 45% 
of a family physician’s time is spent 
out of the exam room,21,30 and total 
work time not directly involved with 
a patient clinic visit consumed be-
tween 20 and 50% of a primary care 
physician’s time that is not compen-
sated.21,35 This time includes activi-
ties such as fielding telephone calls, 
emails, prescription refills, and re-
viewing lab reports, imaging reports, 
and consultant reports.36 
Previous researchers observed 
that for each additional problem ad-
dressed in clinic, the visit length in-
creased by 1 to 2.5 minutes.15 These 
studies followed physicians in pri-
vate practice who managed few-
er problems per visit than in our 
study. Previous research has also 
found that inner-city patients, such 
as those seen in almost all our clin-
ic sites, had more chronic medical 
problems and more problems eval-
uated per visit.37 Our results yield-
ed a 2-slope relationship, where the 
total time increased by 2.6 minutes 
per additional issue the physician 
addressed up to six issues, then pla-
teaued. 
An unexpected finding was that 
an important independent predictor 
of total visit time and non-face time 
was whether a resident checked out 
the patient with an attending, even 
though precepting time was removed 
from the reported times. This could 
reflect that we should have attribut-
ed more time to precepting, that pa-
tient visits that were checked out to 
attendings were more complex than 
average and required more thought 
and time, or that the attending 
changed some of the residents’ as-
sessments and plans.
Our findings have important eco-
nomic implications for family phy-
sicians. The original studies led by 
Hsiao that led to the Resource-Based 
Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) used 
by the Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services to value physi-
cian work, were conducted at a time 
when there was less work performed 
between visits and before the current 
evaluation and management (E&M) 
rules were enacted.38 In Hsiao’s origi-
nal studies, non-face time was esti-
mated to be 29% of the total visit 
time for primary care E&M vis-
its,39 and were based on telephone 
surveys of physicians.40 Our study 
found this figure to be 54% of the 
total visit time. Furthermore, in the 
Hsiao’s studies, hypothetical cases 
based on current procedural termi-
nology (CPT) codes were used. How-
ever, there are no CPT codes that 
describe when a physician address-
es more than three issues in a visit, 
nor are physicians allowed to submit 
more than one E&M CPT code per 
day for payment.38 This implies that 
the relative value weightings of the 
CPT codes should be recalculated to 
increase payment for the significant 
EHR work time required in today’s 
primary care.
