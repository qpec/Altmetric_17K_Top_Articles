CASE REPORT
Polyethylene glycol as a cause 
of anaphylaxis
Katharina Wylon*, Sabine Dölle and Margitta Worm
Abstract 
Background: Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) or macrogols are polyether compounds and are widely used as additives in 
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food.
Case report: We report on a Caucasian patient experiencing recurrent severe allergic reactions to several drugs. An 
extensive diagnostic workup including skin prick tests, intradermal tests (IDT) and a double-blind oral challenge was 
performed to identify the trigger of anaphylaxis. In the present case hypersensitivity to the additive polyethylene 
glycol was confirmed by an IDT suggesting an Immunoglobulin E-dependent mechanism as a cause of the reaction.
Conclusion: Potential life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions to hidden molecules like macrogol may be under-
diagnosed. Cases of immediate-type PEG hypersensitivity were reported with increasing frequency. The awareness 
regarding the allergenic potential of PEG should be raised and a proper product labelling is crucial to prevent PEG 
mediated hypersensitivity.

Background
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) or macrogol is a polyether 
compound. It is widely used as an additive in pharmaceu-
ticals, cosmetics and food [1]. Different types of macrogol 
exist according to their molecular weight from 300 g/mol 
to 10,000,000 g/mol [2]. Anaphylactic reactions to mac-
rogol are rarely reported. However, in recent years more 
reports appeared in the literature with macrogol induced 
hypersensitivities due to drugs, personal hygiene prod-
ucts, dental products, lozenges and lubricants [3, 4]. Here 
we report on a female with a history of three immediate 
type reactions triggered by macrogol 3350.
Case report
A 46-year-old Caucasian female with no known allergies 
received an intraarticular injection with a local anes-
thetic (Xylonest®: prilocaine, sodium chloride, sodium 
hydroxide/hydrochloric acid 7%). Eight hour after the 
injection she experienced nausea and a generalized pru-
ritus. The symptoms resolved the next day without any 
medical treatment. One day later the patient was given 
an injection with medroxyprogesteronacetate (Clinovir®: 
medroxyprogesteronacetate, methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate 
and propyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, macrogol 3350, poly-
sorbate 80, sodium chloride) from her gynecologist. Five 
minutes after the injection she developed generalized 
pruritus, sneezing, nausea and tachycardia. Previous 
injections with medroxyprogesteronacetate and prilo-
caine were well tolerated.
One year later the patient received an injection to treat 
a lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse containing lido-
caine, bupivacaine hydrochloride, triamcinolone aceton-
ide (Triamhexal®: triamcinolonacetonide, benzyl alcohol, 
macrogol 4000, sodium chloride, sodium dihydrogen 
phosphate-dihydrate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, poly-
sorbate 80). Within 5 min the patient developed systemic 
anaphylactic symptoms, including pruritus, nausea, tach-
ycardia and flush.
The patient presented to our outpatient clinic 4 months 
after the first incident and 3 days after the third reaction. 
We initiated an allergological work-up including skin 
prick tests with macrogol, Clinovir®, latex, benzyl alco-
hol, paraben mix, sodium-benzoate, p-hydroxybenzate 
acid, sodium-metabisulfite, local anesthetics (procaine

1%, lidocaine 1%, bupivacaine 0.5%, prilocaine 1%, artic-
aine 1%, mepivacaine 1%, scandicaine 1%, xylocaine 1%, 
ultracaine 1%, novocaine 1%), glucocorticosteroids (dexa-
methasone, prednisolone, triamcinolone, methylpred-
nisolone) which were negative for all tested substances 
(Table 1). A negative control (sodium chloride 0.9%) and 
a positive control (histamine 10 mg/ml) were included. 
Total immunoglobulin E (IgE) was 93.5 kU/l and tryptase 
was 1.8 µg/l. A double-blind, placebo-controlled oral chal-
lenge with the additives which are in the preparations of 
Clinovir® and Triamhexal® (sodium-benzoate 250 mg and 
p-hydroxybenzoic acid 250 mg) was negative (Table 2). An 
intradermal test was performed with local anesthetics and 
additives of the suspected trigger substances (1% macro-
gol 3350, 10% macrogol 3350, polysorbate 80, scandicaine, 
xylocaine, ultracaine, bupivacaine, prilocaine, novocaine). 
After injecting 1% macrogol 3350 intradermal a 6 mm 
wheel was seen. 15 min later we carried out a second 
intradermal test with 10% macrogol 3350 which showed a 
6 mm wheel diameter (Table 3). Consecutively the patient 
developed a systemic reaction with generalized pruritus 
and a generalized urticaria. The wheel diameter enlarged 
up to 12 mm, 5 min after the application.
Based on the history and the obtained skin test results 
our patient was diagnosed with an immediate type reac-
tion to macrogol. We suspect that the first severe allergic 
reaction our patient experienced was not solely induced 
by prilocaine but another local anesthetic or an unknown 
additive containing macrogol. We prescribed an emer-
gency kit containing an epinephrine auto-injector, a 
glucocorticosteroid and an antihistamine. The patient 
received an allergy pass and was instructed to avoid PEG 
analogues when taking new, over-the-counter drugs pre-
scription drugs, personal hygiene products, dental prod-
ucts and other potentially PEG containing products.
Two years after the diagnosis of the hypersensitivity 
to macrogol the patient ingested WICK Medinait® (par-
acetamol, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylam-
insuccinate, sucrose, glycerol, macrogol 6000, sodium 
citrate, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate) treating a 
common cold. Again, she developed dyspnea and a gen-
eralized rash.
Conclusions
However, data from the European anaphylaxis-regis-
try with currently 7935 registered anaphylactic cases 
only three were induced by macrogol. These findings 
may imply that polyethylene glycol hypersensitivity is 
potentially life-threatening but probably underdiag-
nosed as many drugs and food items contain macrogol 
[4–6]. Handling patients with macrogol hypersensitiv-
ity can be challenging because of the extensive aller-
gologic work up, the necessity of the physician’s 
expertise and the limited avoidance options because 
many drugs, including those used for the treatment of 
allergic reactions such as antihistamines may contain 
macrogol as an additive [5]. Therefore, specific prod-
uct labeling and awareness is required. Patients should 
be educated about drugs which may contain PEGs, but 
also other products like lubricants or ultrasound gels. 
Our case indicated the need for an increased patient 
and physician awareness to the allergic potential of 
macrogol.
Concerning the mechanism of anaphylaxis mediated 
by PEGs different mechanisms have been proposed. Our 
case supports the assumption of cross-reactivity between 
PEGs of different molecular weights and polyethylene

glycol analogues [7, 8]. Like other authors have previ-
ously shown, the positive intradermal test suggests an 
IgE-dependent mechanism, although no control tests 
were performed on healthy individuals to rule out unspe-
cific reactivity [9]. However, even after a 1:10 dilution a 
positive intradermal test was observed. Other methods 
besides an oral challenge test to confirm the diagno-
sis may be by basophil activation test or western blot to 
show specific IgE binding [9].
In conclusion, cases of immediate-type PEG hypersen-
sitivity are reported with increasing frequency, therefore, 
awareness of PEG’s allergenic potential should be raised 
and better product labeling should be discussed.
