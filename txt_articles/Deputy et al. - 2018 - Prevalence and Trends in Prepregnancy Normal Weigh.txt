Prevalence and Trends in Prepregnancy Normal Weight — 48 States, 
New York City, and District of Columbia, 2011–2015

Women who enter pregnancy at a weight above or below normal 
weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5–24.9 (calcu-
lated as weight in kg/height in m2), are more likely to experience 
adverse pregnancy outcomes and to have infants who experience 
adverse health outcomes. For example, prepregnancy underweight 
(BMI <18.5) increases the risk for small-for-gestational-age 
births, whereas prepregnancy overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9) and 
obesity (BMI ≥30.0) increase risks for cesarean delivery, large-
for-gestational-age births, and childhood obesity (1). Given these 
outcomes, Healthy People 2020 includes an objective to increase the 
proportion of women entering pregnancy with a normal weight 
from 52.5% in 2007 to 57.8% by 2020.* Because recent trends 
in prepregnancy normal weight have not been reported, CDC 
examined 2011–2015 National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) 
natality data, which included prepregnancy BMI. In 2015, for 48 
states, the District of Columbia (DC), and New York City (NYC) 
combined, the prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight was 
45.0%; prevalence ranged from 37.7% in Mississippi to 52.2% in 
DC. Among 38 jurisdictions with prepregnancy BMI data during 
2011–2015, normal weight prevalence declined from 47.3% to 
45.1%; declines were observed in all jurisdictions but were statisti-
cally significant for 27 jurisdictions after standardizing to the 2011 
national maternal age and race/ethnicity distribution. Screening 
women’s BMI during routine clinical care provides opportunities 
to promote normal weight before entering pregnancy.
NVSS collects demographic and health information for live 
births in 50 states† and DC via the U.S. Standard Certificate 
of Live Birth (birth certificate), which was revised in 2003 to 
include maternal height and prepregnancy weight. Height and 
prepregnancy weight are self-reported or abstracted from medical 
records§ and are used by NVSS to calculate prepregnancy BMI. 
* Healthy People 2020 Maternal, Infant and Child Health (MICH) Objective 16.5 
for healthy prepregnancy weight (defined as normal weight BMI) was developed 
using state-specific surveillance data that rely on self-reported height and 
prepregnancy weight reported approximately 2–7 months postpartum. Data from 
28 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System and 
data from California’s Maternal and Infant Health Assessment survey contributed 
to the development of this objective. https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/
topics-objectives/topic/Maternal-Infant-and-Child-Health/objectives.
† Natality data from New York City are reported separately from those for the 
state of New York and are not included in New York estimates.
§ Per National Center for Health Statistics guidance for completing the 2003 
revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, the preferred source for 
prepregnancy weight and height is self-report by the mother around the time 
of delivery, which is recorded on the Mother’s Worksheet (https://www.cdc.
gov/nchs/data/dvs/momswkstf_improv.pdf). Maternal height and prepregnancy 
weight recorded in the mother’s prenatal care record may be used as an alternative 
source. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/birth_edit_specifications.pdf.
The revised birth certificate was used in 36 states, DC, and NYC 
by 2011 and was used in 48 states, DC, and NYC by 2015 
(representing 83% and 97% of all live births in 2011 and 2015, 
respectively).¶ Births to U.S. resident mothers in states adopting 
the revised birth certificate by January 1 of each year were eligible 
for analyses (17,906,182 mothers, representing 90% of all U.S. 
births during 2011–2015).** From these records, those with 
missing BMI (732,052) were excluded, resulting in 17,174,130 
records for analysis (96% of births eligible for this analysis).
Prepregnancy BMI was categorized as underweight (<18.5), 
normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), or 
obese (≥30.0); for some analyses, obesity was categorized as 
class I (BMI = 30.0–34.9), class II (35.0–39.9), or class III 
(≥40.0). Overall and jurisdiction-specific prevalences for 
each prepregnancy BMI category were estimated. Overall and 
jurisdiction-specific trends were estimated as the percentage-
point difference in prepregnancy normal weight prevalence 
from 2011 to 2015 for 38 jurisdictions with available data; 
overall trends for each prepregnancy BMI category were also 
estimated as the percentage change from 2011 to 2015. Because 
prepregnancy BMI increases with maternal age and varies by 
maternal race/ethnicity (2), jurisdiction-specific differences 
were estimated after directly standardizing each year to the 
race/ethnicity and age distribution†† of 2011 U.S. resident 
mothers to facilitate comparisons. Standardized, jurisdiction-
specific differences were evaluated using the z-statistic; p<0.05 
was considered statistically significant.
For 48 states, DC, and NYC in 2015, the overall prevalence 
of prepregnancy normal weight was 45.0%; prevalences ranged 
from 37.7% in Mississippi to 52.2% in DC (Table 1). Among 
38 jurisdictions with prepregnancy BMI data from 2011 to 
2015, prevalence of normal weight declined from 47.3% to 
45.1%; after standardization, this represented a 1.9 percentage-
point decline (p<0.05). Declines in prepregnancy normal 
 ¶ Connecticut and New Jersey did not use the revised birth certificate by 
January 1, 2015.
 
** For each year from 2011 to 2015, the distributions of maternal race/ethnicity 
and age were not meaningfully different for women residing in states that 
used the revised birth certificate compared with the entire population of 
women giving birth in the United States. Additional information can be found 
in the Birth Data File User’s Guide for each year. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm.
 
†† Race/ethnicity was classified as Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, black, American 
Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander. Age was categorized into 
the following age groups: <19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, and >35 years.

weight were observed in all 38 jurisdictions, but were statis-
tically significant in 27 jurisdictions; declines ranged from 
1.0 percentage point (p = 0.01) in Wisconsin to 3.5 percentage 
points (p<0.001) in Delaware over the 5-year period (Table 1).
Corresponding with the decline in prepregnancy normal 
weight prevalence during 2011–2015, the entire BMI distribu-
tion shifted toward a higher BMI (Figure). Specifically, there 
was an 8% decrease in the prepregnancy underweight preva-
lence, while there were 2% and 8% increases in overweight 
and obesity, respectively. Notably, class III obesity prevalence 
increased more rapidly than did class I or class II obesity 
(increase of 14% [class III], compared with 10% [class II] 
and 6% [class I]).
In 2015, jurisdictions with the highest prepregnancy normal 
weight prevalence (DC, Massachusetts, NYC, and Utah) had 
the lowest obesity prevalence, whereas jurisdictions with low-
est prepregnancy normal weight prevalence (Mississippi and 
West Virginia) had the highest obesity prevalence (Table 2). 
Although NYC had a relatively high prevalence of prepreg-
nancy normal weight, it also had the highest prevalence of 
underweight. Notably, some states exhibited a double burden 
of higher prevalences of prepregnancy underweight and obesity 
(Arkansas, Kentucky, and West Virginia).
Discussion
Among the 48 states, DC, and NYC that implemented the 
revised birth certificate, the overall prevalence of prepregnancy 
normal weight in 2015 was 45.0%. Among 38 jurisdictions 
with prepregnancy BMI data from 2011 to 2015, the preva-
lence of prepregnancy normal weight declined by 5%, whereas 
the prevalence of overweight increased by 2%, and the preva-
lence of obesity (all classes) increased by 8%; taken together, 
these results suggest movement away from the Healthy People 
2020 target for prepregnancy normal weight.
Trends from this analysis extend previous findings and 
demonstrate continued declines in prepregnancy normal 
weight prevalence. Data from 20 states participating in the 
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a multistate 
representative surveillance system, found prevalence of prepreg-
nancy normal weight declined from 54.5% in 2003 to 51.5% 
in 2009 (3). Data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey indicate prevalence of normal weight

also declined among nonpregnant women aged 20–34 years, 
from 42.5% in 1999–2002 to 38.1% in 2011–2014; similar 
declines were observed for women aged 35–44 years (4). 
The declining prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight 
is concerning because of adverse outcomes associated with 
entering pregnancy outside of normal weight. For example, 
prepregnancy underweight increases risks for preterm delivery 
and small-for-gestational-age births, whereas prepregnancy 
overweight and obesity increase risks for gestational diabetes 
mellitus and childhood obesity (1). Moreover, obesity during

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Entering pregnancy outside a normal weight (body mass index 
[BMI] of 18.5–24.9 kg/m2) is associated with adverse maternal 
and infant health outcomes; given these outcomes, Healthy 
People 2020 includes an objective to increase the proportion of 
women entering pregnancy with normal weight. Recent trends 
in national or jurisdiction-specific prevalence of prepregnancy 
normal weight have not been reported.
What is added by this report?
Using data from the revised birth certificate for 48 states, the 
District of Columbia (DC), and New York City (NYC), this analysis 
found that the overall prevalence of prepregnancy normal 
weight was 45.0% in 2015; prevalence ranged from 37.7% in 
Mississippi to 52.2% in DC. Among 36 states, DC, and NYC with 
available prepregnancy BMI data from 2011 to 2015, prevalence 
of normal weight declined from 47.3% to 45.1%; declines were 
observed in all jurisdictions but were statistically significant 
among 27 after standardizing to the 2011 national maternal age 
and race/ethnicity distribution.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Overall and among most jurisdictions examined, the prevalence 
of prepregnancy normal weight is decreasing; this suggests 
movement away from the Healthy People 2020 objective for 
prepregnancy normal weight. For women of reproductive age, 
BMI screening during routine clinical visits provides opportuni-
ties to address underweight or obesity, promote normal weight 
upon entering pregnancy, and ultimately help optimize 
maternal and child health outcomes.
pregnancy has been associated with increased health care service 
utilization, including longer hospital stays during delivery (5). 
Before pregnancy, obesity among women of reproductive age 
is associated with reduced fertility and potentially increased 
use of fertility treatments (6).
Preconception care is the provision of medical care and 
interventions that promote optimal health for reproductive-
age women and also promote optimal pregnancy outcomes 
should a pregnancy occur (7). Weight-related screening, 
counseling, and referral for treatment services are some of the 
components of preconception care (7,8). The U.S. Preventive 
Services Task Force recommends that clinicians assess BMI 
to screen all adults for obesity and offer patients with obesity 
intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions or refer 
patients for these interventions.§§ The American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends BMI 
screening during routine well-woman visits¶¶ and recently 
released an online toolkit††† to facilitate BMI screening and

Health-Care-Providers/Obesity-Toolkit.
referral for treatment. The toolkit includes an obesity assess-
ment algorithm, counseling methods, treatment options, refer-
ral resources, and a coding guide to facilitate reimbursement. 
For women with underweight BMI, ACOG recommends that 
clinicians counsel patients about adverse pregnancy outcomes 
associated with underweight and assess for disordered eating 
habits (8). Reports indicate prevalence of prepregnancy under-
weight is highest among women aged <20 years (2), possibly 
because adult BMI criteria are applied to pregnancies among 
adults and adolescents (9); this categorizes more adolescents 
as underweight than the pediatric growth charts and results in 
higher recommended pregnancy weight gain, which has been 
found to improve pregnancy outcomes among adolescents (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi-
tations. First, height and prepregnancy weight on the birth 
certificate are self-reported or abstracted from medical records, 
which might result in misclassification of BMI category. 
Second, results of this analysis are not directly comparable to 
Healthy People 2020 targets for prepregnancy normal weight 
because these targets were developed using surveillance data 
from 29 states that exclusively rely on height and prepregnancy 
weight self-reported 2–7 months postpartum; thus, these tar-
gets might differ from those developed using birth certificate 
data. Notably, the revised birth certificate is a census of all 
births, which will allow for ongoing monitoring of prepreg-
nancy weight in all states. Finally, data were not available from 
all states for trend analyses; thus, results do not represent the 
entire U.S. population of women giving birth.
In 2015, the nearly national prevalence of prepregnancy 
normal weight was 45.0% and prevalence declined from 2011 
to 2015 in most jurisdictions, suggesting movement away from 
the Healthy People 2020 objective to increase the prevalence 
of prepregnancy normal weight. For all women of reproduc-
tive age, BMI screening during routine clinical visits provides 
opportunities to address underweight or obesity, promote 
normal weight upon entering pregnancy, and ultimately help 
optimize maternal and child health outcomes.
