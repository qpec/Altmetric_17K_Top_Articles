Abstract
OBJECTIVES—We have carried out a systematic review of longitudinal studies examining the 
association between oral health and cognitive decline.
DESIGN—Studies, published 01/1993-03/2013, were identified by search of English language 
publications in PubMed/Medline using relevant MeSH terms and title/abstract keywords, and from 
CINAHL using relevant subject headings. After applying eligibility criteria, and adding four 
studies identified from article references, 56 of the 1412 articles identified remained: 40 were 
cross-sectional, and 16 longitudinal; 11 of the latter examined the impact of oral health on change 
in cognitive health or dementia incidence, five examined the reverse.
SETTING—Sources of information included administrative data, subject evaluations in parent 
studies, medical and dental records, self-reports, and in-person evaluations.
MEASUREMENTS—Most studies used subjects whose oral or cognitive status was known, 
adding the missing piece using standard measures. The oral health information most frequently 
studied included number of teeth, periodontal and caries problems, and denture use. Cognition was 
most frequently evaluated using the MMSE, or by determination of dementia.
RESULTS—Some studies found that oral health measures such as number of teeth and 
periodontal disease were associated with increased risk of cognitive decline or incident dementia, 
while others did not find the association. Similarly, cognitive decline was not consistently 
associated with greater loss of teeth or number of caries. Methodological limitations likely play a 
major role in explaining the inconsistent findings.
CONCLUSION—It is unclear how or whether oral health and cognitive status are related. 
Additional research is needed in which there is greater agreement on how oral health and cognitive 
states are assessed, in order to better examine the linkages between these two health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
In the past two decades, an increasing number of studies has examined the relationship 
between cognitive impairment and oral health in older adults, since question has arisen as to 
whether, in the elderly, there is an association between oral health status and cognitive 
status, possibly through a common inflammatory pathway.1,2 This issue is of considerable 
relevance given the rapid increase in the proportion and number of older persons in the 
population, an increasing number of whom are retaining their natural teeth.3 Further, 
approximately 36% of those over age 70 are cognitively impaired,4 and the prevalence of 
cognitive impairment and dementia increases with age.5 Up to 5.1 million Americans 
currently have a dementing disorder,6 with an expected doubling by 2050.7
Concomitantly, evidence from clinical samples suggests that the elderly have an increased 
incidence of oral disease, the frequency of oral health problems increasing significantly in 
cognitively impaired elderly, particularly those with dementia. Any intervention that might 
help delay the onset or progression of dementia, including improvement of oral hygiene and 
dental services, could have a significant impact on personal and family well-being, and 
health care costs.
In order to examine the association between oral health and cognition in the elderly, and 
provide direction for future studies, we conducted a systematic review of the existing 
literature. Our focus is on longitudinal studies, since they may be informative with respect to 
causation.
METHODS
Search Strategy
The time frame considered was from the first relevant publication found in 1993,8 to 
03/01/2013. We searched for human study publications in English in the PubMed/Medline 
database, using the MeSH terms (Memory Disorders or Cognition or Cognition Disorders or 
Dementia) AND (Oral Health or Mouth Diseases or Tooth Diseases), which identified 515 
articles; a title/abstract keyword search using (mouth or tooth or oral AND cogni* or 
Alzheimer or dement*), which identified 790 articles; and the CINAHL database using the 
subject headings (dementia+ or Alzheimer’s diseases or cognition+ or cognition disorders+ 
or memory disorders+) AND (mouth diseases or tooth loss or dental caries), identifying 107 
articles. After removing 41 duplicates from the 1412 articles identified, 1371 unique articles 
remained (Figure 1).
We applied two exclusionary criteria to identify non-qualifying articles. The first criterion 
excluded 1,273 articles that, by title/abstract, did not examine the association between 
cognition and oral health diseases and conditions in adults; this left 98 articles. The second 
criterion excluded articles that, based on review of the abstract by two readers, had

 inadequate information on oral health or cognitive status. Any disagreement was resolved by 
a third reviewer. In consequence, an additional 46 articles were excluded and 52 retained. To 
these were added four articles culled from article reference lists, resulting in a total of 56 
articles, based on 55 studies. Of these, 40 articles represented cross-sectional studies, and 16 
represented longitudinal studies.
Data Extraction
Two reviewers independently extracted information from each longitudinal article on: first 
author and date of publication, study name, location; study date(s), sample demographics; 
cognitive and oral health measures; covariates; and key findings. Disagreements on data 
extraction were resolved by consensus with the assistance of a third person.
RESULTS
The characteristics of the 16 longitudinal studies are summarized in Table 1. The first 
section summarizes the 11 studies of oral health predicting cognitive decline, the second 
section summarizes the five studies of cognitive status/dementia predicting oral health.
Several developed countries are represented: U.S. (n=8), Japan (n=3), Australia (n=1), 
France (n=1), Denmark (n=1), Sweden (n=1), and a European consortium (n=1). Two 
studies used the same sample, but different outcomes and statistical analyses.9,10 All but four 
studies9–12 were conducted among community residents, but some community-based studies 
may have included nursing home residents. Sample sizes ranged from small (N=42)13 to 
large (N=11,140, from 215 centers in 20 European countries).14
Subject selection and source of data reflected several creative, overlapping approaches. 
These included use solely of administrative data, 15 use of data already gathered in 
longitudinal studies (often designed for other purposes), 9,10,16–20 selecting subjects for 
whom cognitive status or oral health status had been established and adding an oral or 
cognitive evaluation, 8,11,13,21,22 and linking subject data to administrative records.23
Study design varied: intervention studies of good oral care;12,24 samples matched on 
demographics, by randomization,8,12,13,21 or through use of propensity scores;24 and natural 
history studies.9–11,14–17,19,20,22,23
Measures of Oral Health Status (information is summarized in on-line Table S1.)
Of the 16 studies, nine used oral health evaluation, and seven used dental records. In studies 
gathering oral health data, examiners were trained, calibrated if more than one participated, 
and reliability determined for assessing a variety of oral health measures. The amount of oral 
health information gathered in person or from records, and used in analysis, varied from 
extensive and highly detailed, particularly in studies of oral health predicting cognitive 
impairment (number of decayed, missing, filled teeth; plaque; periodontal disease), 8,13,20,22 
to minimal (self-reported approximate number of teeth currently or when 
younger). 14,15,19,23 Subject-provided information included pain or discomfort, 17 bleeding 
gums, 14 and denture use.11,19,23 Information from dental records was used in three 
studies, 9,10,24 two of which relied on up to 40 years of records.9, 10, 25

 Tooth loss was the most common measure of oral health, recorded in 14 of the 16 studies, 
with a significant relationship to cognition reported in 11.9–11,13,15–17,19,20,22,23 When used 
in analysis, the number of teeth present was typically categorized, with categorization 
varying from study to study, and sometimes linked to denture use. 9,11,15,17
Eleven studies used clinical evaluation to assess oral health status.8–13,16,17,20,21,24 In some 
studies, standard oral health indices were used: Debris Index for plaque score, 12 
Community Periodontal Index, 17 Gingival Index, 20 Plaque Index, 20 Katz criteria for roots, 
and adjusted caries increment, 21 and National Institute for Dental Research (NIDR) 
criteria.8,13,21,22
In examining periodontal disease, attention was paid to 1) extent of gingival bleeding on 
probing (ratio of examined sites), 2) proportion of examined sites with loss of attachment >3 
mm, and 3) mean pocket depth. Periodontal diseases were assessed in five studies, four on 
the impact of oral health on cognitive impairment (three studies used clinical 
assessment, 16,17,20 one used self-report14) and in one study of the effect of cognitive 
impairment on oral health.13 In addition, two studies assessed periodontal damage based on 
decades of dental records.9,10
Measures of Cognitive Assessment (information is summarized in on-line Table S2.)
Assessment of the presence of dementia included self-reported diagnosis, use of standard 
clinical diagnostic criteria, neuropathological diagnostic criteria, and information from 
medical, dental, and administrative records. Cognitive status was based on a variety of 
neuropsychology measures, ranging from use of a substantial battery to reliance on a single 
brief measure.
The standard diagnostic criteria for dementia included DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, ICD-9CM-R, 
ICD-10, reflecting the date of evaluation.13–15,17,22 At times these criteria were 
supplemented by NINCDS-ADRDA (Alzheimer’s disease [AD]), 13,15,17 NINDS-AIREN 
(vascular dementia), 15 Hachinski scale (vascular dementia),17 Lund & Manchester (frontal 
lobe dementia),15 Geriatric Mental State examination,17 and the Global Deterioration 
Scale,26 which assesses both presence and severity of dementia.21,22 Neuropathological 
criteria27 were also used, but available for only one dataset.9
Non-AD dementias15,17,22 were rarely analyzed separately because of limited numbers. The 
validity of administrative records, which were frequently used, was evaluated for only one 
study.15 Both cognitive batteries and individual measures were used to assess cognitive 
change and ascertain the presence of dementia. The most popular single measure was the

 Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), 28 used in 10 studies – in eight as a single measure, four 
of which examined the effect of oral condition on cognitive state, 12,14,16,19 and four the 
reverse, 8,13,21,22 and in two studies as part of a larger neuropsychology battery.9,17 All 
neuropsychology measures had established validity and reliability. Criteria used to assess 
cognitive change included self-perceived deterioration, change in score on neuropsychology 
measures, a specific decline (which differed across studies), crossing a cut-point (with cut-
points differing across studies), or reaching an administrative criterion indicating need for 
assistance.
Covariates Used in Analysis (summarized in online Table S3.)
The covariates used varied widely across studies. They included demographic characteristics 
(sex, race, education, income, -- none uniformly reported); and specific health conditions 
and associated risk factors or the number of health conditions present (12 studies), and the 
Charlson Index.31 Also considered were biomarker and genetic information (interleukin 
(IL)-6, C-reactive protein, APOE ε4, 1st degree kin with dementia); 9,10,19,20 prescription 
and over-the-counter medications, particularly anticholinergics;16,20,21,24 scales of 
depression and caregiver burden;14,17,21 and measures of life style and health behaviors 
(included by 10 studies). No study included all these areas.
Findings
The impact of oral health on cognitive status (11 articles)—Two studies indicated 
that having fewer teeth at baseline or decline in number of teeth, was not associated 
significantly with cognitive decline.11,20 This was contradicted by other studies which found 
an association with cognitive decline, 10,16 and with dementia.14,15,23 Findings are further 
complicated: one reported an association only in women; 19 another reported that with 
higher education the number of missing teeth was not associated with dementia, but among 
those with lower education, individuals with a greater number of missing teeth were less 
likely to have dementia;17 and a third reported that having fewer teeth increased the hazard 
of dementia, but not when periodontal damage was present.9 Development of caries or the 
presence of new restoration was associated with lower performance on the MMSE and a 
spatial copying task.16 Mastication difficulty was not associated with incident dementia.23
Five studies examined the effect of periodontal disease on incident dementia, cognitive 
decline, or low level of cognitive functioning.9,14,16,17,20 Two of them found some indication 
of a relationship: alveolar bone loss and pocket depth was associated with poor cognitive 
functioning,16 the other found a significant decline on the Modified Mini-Mental State 
(3MS) Examination (which assesses several areas of cognition), but only when the 
continuous form of the gingival index was categorized, and the bottom quartile compared 
with the rest; no significant decline was found on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test.20
Three studies asked about or provided personal dental care. An intervention in nursing 
homes to make sure that teeth, dentures, and the oral cavity were cleaned, and plaque and 
calculus controlled, found a significantly smaller decline in MMSE score in the group 
receiving this oral care, however, variation was large and the numbers present at study end 
were unclear.12 In one study, poor oral hygiene and no regular visits to the dentist predicted

 incident dementia.23 Similar findings were reported in another study but were sex-specific -- 
no daily tooth brushing (women only), and no dental visits in the previous 12 months (men 
only) predicted incident dementia.19
The impact of cognitive status on oral health (5 articles)—Sample sizes tended to 
be small when examining the impact of cognitive status on longitudinal oral status, while the 
number of oral outcomes of interest was large. One study, which provided routine dental 
care and treatment, focused specifically on tooth loss; neither number of teeth lost, nor rate 
of loss differed significantly between the dementia and no dementia groups.24 Other studies 
also found no statistically significant differences in number of teeth or restored surfaces.13,22
Considerable attention was paid to increase in the number of caries, which, variously, was 
higher in patients with dementia,21 higher but not significant because of small sample size,8 
or not significantly different.22 Poorer MMSE scores were associated with increased 
gingival bleeding and plaque and diminished mucosal health, but with small sample size 
these findings were only suggestive.12,14,16
Assessment of strength of the eligible studies
We used a set of criteria to assess each of the studies, including sample selection, adequate 
sample size, description of the sample, validated assessment of the exposure (e.g., cognitive 
status or oral health measure) and outcome (e.g., cognitive status or oral health measure), 
length of follow-up period, attrition, controls for confounding, and appropriate analytic 
approach.40 The evidence suggests that there are methodological deficiencies in this area, 
most notably due to small sample size or lack of representativeness of the population, 
inadequate assessment of cognitive function and lack of clinical evaluation of oral health. 
Thus, there was insufficient evidence to date for a causal association between cognitive 
function and oral health.
DISCUSSION
Our systematic review of the first two decades of longitudinal studies designed to examine 
the association between oral health and cognitive status identified 16 studies, 11 examined 
the effect of oral status on change in cognitive status, and five the reverse. The uneven 
distribution likely reflects the costs and difficulties of carrying out oral health assessments. It 
is easier and cheaper to add cognitive assessments to a study for which oral health has 
already been measured, than to do the reverse.
It is currently unclear how or whether oral health conditions and cognitive status are related. 
Findings based on number or change in number of teeth or caries, are conflicting, or, 
because of inadequate sample size, do not reach statistical significance. Limited studies (two 
out of five) found periodontal conditions, such as gingival health or pocket depth, was 
associated with poorer cognitive status or cognitive decline, with findings possibly sensitive 
to the neuropsychology assessments used. There are indications, albeit weak, that better oral 
hygiene and regular dental visits may reduce the rate of cognitive decline, and the hazard of 
incident dementia.12,19,23 Certainly, with good dental care, the dental status of patients with 
dementia remained comparable to that of patients without a dementing disorder.24 These

 findings may reflect that incipient cognitive decline or dementia leads to decline in hygiene, 
but that oral health can be maintained with self or assisted oral hygiene, and dental 
appointments.
While the argument of a common underlying cause associated with inflammation may be 
enticing,1,2 it was examined directly in only one study, and there found to be only marginally 
relevant.20 Current studies are not adequate to indicate whether poor oral health and 
cognitive decline have a common underlying cause in inflammation, but with the increase in 
major surveys with biomarker data, test of this hypothesis is becoming more feasible.
Because of the costs of detailed dental examination, there may be a temptation to carry out 
small sample studies. As seen in the current review, this results in a lack of power. There is 
also a temptation to match cases and controls, but matching must be considered carefully. 
Doing so eliminates the possibility of examining the “matching” conditions (e.g., 
demographic characteristics), which may be associated with both oral health and cognitive 
status. With an older population, the duration of a study becomes an issue because of 
incidence of additional chronic conditions which may affect oral health and cognition, 
attrition due to sickness, and death.
To better compare findings across studies, agreement is needed regarding the oral health 
issues to be explored, oral health and neuropsychological measures to use, and covariates for 
which to adjust. In particular, to reduce the costs of dental studies, additional information is 
needed on the extent to which self-report accurately determines oral health condition, oral 
hygiene behavior, and dental visits. While it appears that self-assessment of obvious 
conditions (e.g., number of teeth), and those that are salient (e.g., root canal, dentures) can 
be reported reliably (with accuracy varying by demographic status), report is less reliable for 
conditions requiring oral health expertise (e.g., caries, periodontal disease).32,33 However, 
since no studies have been conducted to examine the reliability of self-reported data among 
individuals with cognitive impairment, we are less certain how reliable the self-reported oral 
health data is in such individuals.
There is a considerable literature on assessment of cognitive state, with agreement on 
preferred measures to use in Memory Disorders clinics to assess dementing disorders,34 and 
procedures to follow in epidemiological studies, such as diagnostic adjudication. With 
increasing information on dementia, diagnostic criteria are changing, and diagnosis at an 
earlier stage of disease is becoming possible. Consequently, the characteristics of diagnosed 
subjects may change, with findings on an oral health/dementia association changing also.
Standardization of assessment of cognitive status should be considered. The most frequently 
used measure has been the MMSE,28 indicating preference for a brief, easy to administer 
assessment. The MMSE has several drawbacks: multiple versions with unknown 
equivalence; performance, as with many brief cognitive screens, that is age-, race-, and 
education-biased; a ceiling effect, and payment required for use. Improved screens, such as 
the Montreal Cognitive Assessment35 have become available since data were gathered for 
many of the current studies, and these screens should be considered. Agreement on use of a 
brief screen would facilitate comparison of findings, and aggregation of data.

 Covariates varied from study to study, with a large variety reported: demographic, health 
conditions (in particular cardiovascular conditions and risk factors), medications 
(anticholinergics), health behaviors, and an assortment of other characteristics (e.g., scales of 
depression, caregiver burden). Certain relevant information was rarely included: e.g., 
nutrition, which affects oral health and general health, and environmental characteristics 
(dental insurance, access to dentists, cultural expectations regarding dentition). Although 
many studies have found self-report of medical conditions to be valid,36 caution is needed 
regarding medical and dental records and administrative data. Diagnosis of dementia based 
on administrative records which determine level of care to be provided may yield over-
diagnosis, while dementing disorders may be under-reported in administrative medical 
records and death certificates.37,38 Agreement is needed on which covariates to include in 
analysis, and the manner in which they should be handled, in particular, regarding 
categorization of age, and education.
Current studies that capitalize on already available information on oral health, cognition, or 
biomarkers, illustrate how sample size and possibly representativeness can be increased, and 
costs reduced. In addition to secondary analysis of data,14,16,20 some studies have used 
administrative records with known sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of dementia,15 
while others have linked the main study data to dental records.9,10 Although there is no 
report as to whether those dental records were evaluated, studies that have examined pre-
existing radiographs have found them to be usable for assessment of periodontal disease.39
This is the first systematic review to examine longitudinal studies focused on oral health and 
cognition. As such, it shows substantial diversity across studies with regard to data and 
sample sources, sample size, and variety of oral health data and cognitive data obtained. In 
summary, the strength of the evidence is weak, and findings were often inconsistent. For 
example, some studies found a significant association, albeit relatively weak, between 
periodontal disease and cognitive decline; but other studies found no association. Similarly 
the association between dental caries and cognition was inconsistent across studies. Findings 
are even more complex for the association between tooth loss and cognitive decline, ranging 
from a positive association, to no association, to a negative association (only in the group 
with a lower level of education) across different studies. However, these studies lay the 
groundwork for future longitudinal work.
While research in the field appears to be moving in the right direction, we would like to 
make some specific suggestions, operationalization of which may permit more accurate 
determination of the grounds for an association, if one is present, between oral health and 
cognitive status. In the current studies, cognitive function has been evaluated using a great 
variety of cognitive measures. Information could be better evaluated if there was agreement 
on a uniform set of cognitive assessments. When change in cognition is assessed, it may be 
preferable to examine decline in cognitive function (which is more straightforward to 
assess), instead of development of dementing disorders, with attendant complexities in 
diagnosis. Regarding the assessment of oral health status, several studies used standardized 
oral health examination protocols, such as the U.S. National Institute of Dental Research 
protocol,21,22, a procedure which should be emphasized. Future research should pay more 
attention to calibration of dental assessment, both between and within dental evaluators. The

 oral health outcomes used should reflect oral health status which can change during the 
study period. With respect to other aspects of study design, use of standard covariates, 
samples sized adequately for the number and type of outcomes to be measured and better 
representative of the study population, a study duration appropriate to the planned outcome, 
and sophisticated statistical approaches already in use should be encouraged.
