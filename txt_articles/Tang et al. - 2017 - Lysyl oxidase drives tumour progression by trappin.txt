Lysyl oxidase (LOX) remodels the tumour microenvironment by cross-linking the extracellular
matrix. LOX overexpression is associated with poor cancer outcomes. Here, we find that
LOX regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to drive tumour progression. We
show that LOX regulates EGFR by suppressing TGFb1 signalling through the secreted protease
HTRA1. This increases the expression of Matrilin2 (MATN2), an EGF-like domain-containing
protein that traps EGFR at the cell surface to facilitate its activation by EGF. We describe
a pharmacological inhibitor of LOX, CCT365623, which disrupts EGFR cell surface retention
and delays the growth of primary and metastatic tumour cells in vivo. Thus, we show that
LOX regulates EGFR cell surface retention to drive tumour progression, and we validate the
therapeutic potential of inhibiting this pathway with the small molecule inhibitor CCT365623.

ysyl oxidase (LOX) is a copper and quinone-cofactor
containing amine oxidase that is secreted as an inactive
pro-enzyme, and is then cleaved to a mature active
form by extracellular metalloproteases such as BMP-1 (ref. 1).
LOX catalyses the formation of covalent bonds in collagens and
elastin and thereby increases the stiffness of the extracellular
matrix (ECM), increasing the tensile strength of extracellular
fibres2,3. Importantly, LOX is also implicated in cancer, because
high LOX expression correlates to poor outcome in colon, breast,
pancreas, prostate and lung cancers4–8. Secreted LOX is reported
to cross-link the ECM at distal sites to create pre-metastatic
niches to which bone marrow-derived and tumour cells are
recruited, facilitating the metastatic spread of cancer9. Moreover,
within the tumour LOX-mediated ECM stiffening is reported to
drive integrin activation and tumour initiation in a mouse model
of breast cancer10, and also to drive the growth of the primary
tumours in colorectal cancer11.
Thus, by modulating tissue stiffness, LOX promotes tumour
progression, but intriguingly, when myofibroblasts are depleted in
a mouse pancreatic cancer model, collagen content and tissue
stiffness are reduced, but disease progression is accelerated12.
Notably, LOX expression remains strong in this model suggesting
that LOX functions beyond regulating matrix stiffness, and
a recent study demonstrates that secreted LOX induces bone
pre-metastatic lesion formation by regulating NFATc1 driven
osteoclastogenesis13. Extracellular LOX is also reported to regulate
signalling by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)14
and
transforming
growth
factor
b1
(TGFb1)15,16.
PDGFR
regulation by LOX is implicated in angiogenesis17, but how LOX
controls intracellular signalling to drive tumour progression is still
poorly understood.
In this study, we examined how LOX regulates intracellular
signalling. Using an unbiased approach, we show that LOX
regulates the EGF receptor (EGFR). We also show that LOX
inhibits TGFb1 through the serine protease HTRA1, and that this
increases expression of the secreted protein MATN2. MATN2
traps EGFR at the cell surface for enhanced activation by EGF,
driving tumour progression. Moreover in vivo inhibition of LOX
by our inhibitor CCT365623 disrupts this signalling axis and
reduces tumour progression.
Results
LOX regulates the EGFR. To discover unidentified functions
of LOX, we examined how its depletion by short-hairpin
RNA (shRNA) affects cell signalling using an antibody array to
measure receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) phosphorylation in MDA-
MB-231 cells. We found that when LOX was depleted in MDA-
MB-231 breast cancer cells grown in standard plastic (2D) culture
conditions, phosphorylation of several RTKs including the EGFR
was reduced (Fig. 1a). LOX cross-links collagen and drives cell
invasion and metastasis, so we performed this assay on cells grown
within collagen gels (3D) and observed that the strongest effects of
LOX depletion are on EGFR and SRC phosphorylation (Fig. 1b).
Although LOX has previously been linked to SRC8, its role in
EGFR signalling has not been reported, but like LOX, EGFR is
implicated in both tumour cell growth and metastasis. For
example, in breast cancer paracrine EGF signalling by tumour-
associated macrophages promoted breast cancer cell invasion18
and the EGFR ligand heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor
(HBEGF) was implicated in brain metastasis19. Since our results
show the link from LOX to EGFR, we focused on their interaction.
By western blot, we confirm that in standard 2D tissue culture
conditions LOX depletion by shRNA causes reduced phosphor-
ylation of EGFR in MDA-MB-231 and U87 cells (Fig. 1c–e).
Critically, this occurs without impacting the levels of total EGFR
in the cells (Fig. 1c), so we examined whether LOX depletion
affects surface retention of EGFR by biotinylating the intact cells
and capturing the biotinylated surface proteins on streptavidin
beads for western blot analysis. Notably, LOX depletion caused
a substantial reduction in the levels of EGFR at the cell surface in
MDA-MB-231 and U87 cells (Fig. 1c,f). Next, we examined EGFR
activation by EGF and found that LOX depletion suppressed
EGF stimulated EGFR phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 and
U87 cells (Fig. 1g,h; Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). Moreover, when
LOX was depleted, EGF stimulated more rapid loss of EGFR
from the cell surface (Fig. 1i,j; Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). Note that
LOX depletion also reduced EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of
the downstream signalling molecule AKT (Fig. 1k,l). Note that
these effects on EGF-stimulated cell signalling were sustained,
because EGFR phosphorylation and surface retention, and also
AKT phosphorylation were suppressed for up to 24 h (Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 1c–g). Altogether, these results show that LOX
modulates EGFR retention at the cell surface and thereby
regulates the fidelity of signalling by this RTK.
To establish if the LOX catalytic activity is responsible for
regulating EGFR function, we transiently deplete endogenous LOX
from MDA-MB-231 cells and test if LOX re-expression restores
EGFR function (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). For these studies, we
use LOX fused to GFP, testing wild-type LOX (LOX-GFP),
a catalytically inactive mutant of LOX (LOXK314A-GFP), a LOX
mutant that cannot be cleaved to the mature form by BMP-1
(LOXDBMP-1-GFP), and the LOX signal peptide fused directly to
GFP (sGFP; Fig. 2a). We confirm that all four proteins are secreted
and that LOXDBMP-1-GFP is not cleaved to the mature active
form (Fig. 2b). We confirm that depletion of endogenous
LOX reduces surface levels of EGFR, and also suppresses EGFR
and AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2c,d). Critically, EGFR surface
retention, and EGFR and AKT phosphorylation are restored by
LOX-GFP, but not by sGFP, LOXK314A-GFP or LOXDBMP-1-GFP
(Fig. 2c,d). Thus, we conclude that EGFR cell surface retention and
signalling require secretion of mature and active LOX.
LOX regulates MATN2 expression through TGFb1 signalling.
To investigate how secreted LOX regulates the EGFR, we
sought to identify extracellular proteins that bind to LOX by
immunoprecipitating LOX-GFP, LOXDBMP-1-GFP and sGFP
from the culture medium of intact MDA-MB-231 cells. The
co-precipitated proteins were analysed by mass-spectrometry,
revealing 19 proteins that bind to wild-type LOX-GFP but not to
sGFP (Fig. 3a). Notably, 9 of these proteins also bind to
LOXDBMP-1-GFP,
leaving
10
(LAMC1,
LAMB2,
COL6A1,
COL6A3, MATN2, ECM1, CCBE1, HTRA1, GPC1, CTGF) that
bind specifically to wild-type LOX. Considering that we estab-
lished that LOX regulates the EGFR, we were particularly intri-
gued that amongst these is MATN2, which contains 10 EGF-like
domains (Supplementary Fig. 3a), so we focused subsequent
studies on this protein. We confirmed that MATN2 bound
to LOX-GFP and LOXK314A-GFP but not LOXDBMP-1-GFP,
confirming that MATN2 bound to mature LOX (Supplementary
Fig. 3b).
Intriguingly, we find that LOX depletion by shRNA results in
a reduction in MATN2 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 and
U87 cells (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 3c), and confirm this
reduced
MATN2
accumulation
in
the
extracellular
space
(Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). Similarly, we find that LOX depletion
causes reduced MATN2 accumulation in the cell-derived matrix of
BJ dermal fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 3f–j). Surprisingly, we
find that LOX depletion downregulates MATN2 mRNA (Fig. 3c).
Thus, in addition to binding to MATN2, we demonstrate that
LOX also regulates MATN2 mRNA expression, and as it had

 previously been reported that LOX suppressed TGFb1 signal-
ling15,16, and separately that TGFb1 downregulated MATN2
mRNA20, we tested if LOX regulates MATN2 through TGFb1
signalling.
We
confirm
that
addition
of
TGFb1
to
cells
downregulates MATN2 mRNA (Fig. 3d), and that the TGFb
type I receptor inhibitor LY364947 restores MATN2 expression
in LOX-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3e; Supplementary
Fig. 3k). We further demonstrate that the TGFb1 effector SMAD2
is activated when LOX is depleted in MDA-MB-231 and U87 cells
(Fig. 3f; Supplementary Fig. 3l) and that phospho-SMAD2
(pSMAD2) accumulates in the nucleus of cells when LOX is
depleted (Fig. 3g; Supplementary Fig. 3m), demonstrating that
TGFb1 signalling is activated by LOX depletion. Importantly, the
activation of TGFb1 signalling and accompanying suppression of
MATN2 protein expression that occurs when endogenous LOX is
depleted are both recovered by expression of wild type LOX-GFP,
but not by sGFP, LOXK314A-GFP or LOXDBMP-1-GFP (Fig. 3h,i;
Supplementary
Fig.
3n).
Thus,
we

LOX regulates MATN2 expression through TGFb1 signalling.
LOX regulates TGFb1 signalling through HTRA1. It is reported
that LOX regulates TGFb1 signalling15,16, but through unknown
mechanisms. We do not find evidence of LOX bound to TGFb1
(Fig. 3a), but note that HTRA1 (high-temperature requirement A
serine peptidase 1), a secreted protease that silences TGFb
signalling by degrading TGFb family proteins21,22, does bind
to LOX-GFP (Fig. 3a). We confirm HTRA1 binding to LOX-GFP

 by western blotting, but note that it does not bind to
LOXK314A-GFP or LOXDBMP-1-GFP (Supplementary Fig. 3o),
suggesting that HTRA1 binding to LOX is dependent on LOX
maturation and catalytic activity.
HTRA1 is a trimer that is activated by the formation of higher-
order
multimers23,
so
we
used
native
polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis to examine HTRA1 in the medium from
our cells. We observe a high proportion of multimers in the
extracellular space of control cells, and these are substantially
reduced when LOX was depleted (Fig. 3j; Supplementary Fig. 3p).
Critically, when LOX is depleted the addition of recom-
binant human HTRA1 (rhHTRA1) rescues MATN2 expression
(Fig. 3k; Supplementary Fig. 3q) and re-inhibits SMAD2 (Fig. 3l;
Supplementary Fig. 3q).
MATN2 potentiates EGFR activation by EGF. Our data show
that LOX regulates MATN2 expression through HTRA1 and
TGFb signalling, so we next examined how MATN2 regulates
EGFR signalling. As noted, MATN2 protein has ten EGF-like
domains, which occupy most of the protein (Supplementary
Fig. 3a), so we tested if it could bind to cell surface EGFR. We find
that recombinant human MATN2 (rhMATN2) binds to the
surface of cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a), but importantly, this cell
surface binding is competed away by EGF (Fig. 4a,b). Moreover,
an EGFR neutralizing antibody also competes for rhMATN2
binding to the cell surface (Fig. 4c,d). Notably, addition of
rhMATN2 increases EGFR levels at the surface of MDA-MB-231
and U87 cells (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Fig. 4b) and depletion of
endogenous MATN2 (Supplementary Fig. 4c) causes a loss of
EGFR from the cell surface under basal and EGF stimulated
conditions (Fig. 4f; Supplementary Fig. 4d). Critically, the
addition of rhMATN2 to the cell culture medium rescues
EGFR retention at the cell surface when LOX is depleted
(Fig. 4g; Supplementary Fig. 4e), and it rescues cell surface
EGFR when MATN2 is depleted (Fig. 4h; Supplementary Fig. 4f).
Note that rhMATN2 does not activate EGFR (Fig. 4i,j), but it
strongly enhances EGFR activation when the cells are stimulated
by EGF (Fig. 4k, Supplementary Fig. 4g). Thus, we conclude
that MATN2 binds to, but does not activate the EGFR; rather
MATN2 potentiates EGFR activation stimulated by EGF.
MATN2 potentiates EGF-driven cell proliferation. Next, we
examine how this pathway regulates cell proliferation. First,
we show that in 10% serum, the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
and U87 (serum) is not affected by LOX depletion (Fig. 5a,b).
Next, we confirm that these cells do not grow in serum
free medium whether or not LOX is depleted (Fig. 5a,b).
We also show that rhMATN2 does not rescue cell growth in
serum free medium whether or not LOX is depleted (Fig. 5a,b).
Importantly, EGF can support cell growth in serum free
medium, but when LOX is depleted, EGF can no longer
rescue cell growth (Fig. 5a,b). Thus, in serum-free medium,
EGF requires LOX to support cell growth, but critically, when
LOX is depleted, the addition of rhMATN2 to the medium
can rescue cell growth driven by EGF (Fig. 5a,b). Thus, consistent
with
our
biochemical
observations,
when
proliferation
is
inhibited because LOX is depleted, EGF plus rhMATN2 rescue
cell growth.

 We then examined the effects of this signalling pathway in vivo
by injecting MDA-MB-231 cells into the tail vein of immuno-
compromised mice. Within 50 days, 5/7 animals that received
shRNA control cells were killed in accordance with licence
guidelines24, whereas all animals that received LOX-depleted cells
remained healthy (Fig. 5c). The mice that received shRNA control
cells had substantial tumour burden in the lungs, whereas
lung tumour burden was substantially lower in mice that received
LOX-depleted cells (Fig. 5d,e; Supplementary Table 1). Critically,
we observe significantly less staining of MATN2 and EGFR in
the plasma membranes of the cells in the LOX-depleted tumours
than in the cells of shRNA control tumours (Fig. 5f,g).
Discovery of a potent oral LOX inhibitor CCT365623. Next, we
used LOX pharmacological inhibitors to test the therapeutic
potential of our findings. Most studies in the field rely on a single
LOX inhibitor, BAPN (b-aminopropionitrile) (compound 1 in
Fig. 6a). We developed complementary compound, CCT365623
(compound 2 in Fig. 6a), a LOX inhibitor from a distinct struc-
tural class that is B16-fold more potent than BAPN (Fig. 6a).
To confirm that CCT365623 inhibits LOX in living cells, we
created a biosensor based on the observation that LOX generates
H2O2 as a by-product of its catalytic activity and surmized that it
should be possible to detect this molecule using a redox-sensitive
version of GFP (roGFP2) (Supplementary Fig. 5a)25,26.

 To create our biosensor, we fuse roGFP2 to the C terminus of
LOX (LOX-roGFP2). We express the biosensor in MDCK cells
because when these cells are grown as cysts in matrigel, they
secrete a layer of the LOX substrate collagen type 1 (CO1) on
their basal surface. First, we confirm that standard LOX-GFP
co-localizes with this basal layer of collagen type 1 in MDCK cysts
(Fig. 6b). Next, we show that LOX-roGFP2 generates a robust
signal on the basal surface of the cysts that is quenched when
the cysts are treated with the reducing agent dithiothreitol
(DTT) (Fig. 6c,d). Moreover, we do not observe a signal with
biosensors made with catalytically inactive LOX (LOXK314A-
roGFP2) or the version of LOX resistant to BMP-1-mediated
cleavage (LOXDBMP-1-roGFP2) (Fig. 6c,d). Thus, our biosensor is
able to measure LOX activity in MDCK cysts, and we show that
in this living cell system CCT365623 inhibits LOX at B5 mM,
whereas BAPN inhibits LOX at B250 mM (Fig. 6e–g).
Next, we show that CCT365623 and BAPN both reduce EGFR
retention at the cell surface (Fig. 6h; Supplementary Fig. 5b,c)
and that they both suppress EGFR and AKT phosphorylation
driven by EGF (Fig. 6i,j; Supplementary Fig. 5d). We show also

 that both compounds inhibit HTRA1 multimer formation, that
they activate SMAD2 and downregulate MATN2 (Fig. 6k–n;
Supplementary Fig. 5e–h). Note that CCT365623 is effective at
50-fold lower concentrations than BAPN (5 versus 250 mM),
but that the results from both inhibitors are consistent with
our genetic experiments.
CCT365623
inhibits
tumour
growth.
Next,
we
tested
CCT365623 in vivo. First, we show that CCT365623 displays
good stability in mouse liver microsomes and does not inhibit
the cardiac potassium channel hERG. It displays excellent selec-
tivity (over 350-fold) for LOX over amine oxidase A and B
(MAO-A, MAO-B) and is over 1,000-fold more selective for LOX
over serum diamine oxidase (DAO) (Supplementary Table 2),
another copper and quinone-cofactor containing amine oxidase
that
prevents
scombroid
poisoning
by
scavenging
extra-
cellular histamine. BAPN also displays generally favourable
properties, but in addition to being significantly less potent
than CCT365623 it is only B14-fold more selective for LOX over
DAO (Supplementary Table 2). Critically, CCT365623 is orally
available, is extremely well tolerated (Supplementary Fig. 6a),
and
has
good
pharmacokinetic
properties
(Supplementary
Table 3).
We tested CCT365623 in a mouse model of spontaneous
breast cancer that metastasizes to the lungs27. In this model
the primary breast tumours become palpable when the mice are
70–75 days old, so we administered CCT365623 by oral gavage
(70 mg kg � 1 per day) starting when the mice were 70 days old.
CCT365623 significantly delays the development of the primary
tumours
and
also
suppresses
metastatic
lung
burden
in
the animals (Fig. 7a–c; Supplementary Table 4). When BAPN is
administered using this protocol, it does not inhibit tumour
development (Supplementary Fig. 6b), but when it is admini-
stered ad libitum in the drinking water (1% w/v), we observe
a
significant
delay
in
primary
tumour
development
and
a reduction in metastatic lung tumour burden (Fig. 7d–f; Supple-
mentary Table 4). Notably, CCT365623 and BAPN elicit
a significant reduction in MATN2 protein levels in both the
primary and metastatic lung tumours and this is accompanied

 by the loss of EGFR from the plasma membranes of the cells in
both the primary and metastatic tumours (Fig. 7g–l).
Discussion
Previously, LOX was shown to regulate integrin and consequently
SRC signalling by modulating ECM stiffness8,10. We confirm that
LOX regulates SRC but importantly, we also describe a previously
unidentified function of LOX in regulating the EGFR. On the
basis of our data, we propose a model whereby LOX activates
the secreted protease HTRA1, which inhibits TGFb1 signalling,
causing increased expression of the EGF-like domain containing
protein MATN2, which then enhances EGFR signalling to drive
tumour growth and metastasis (Fig. 8).

 To date, the most commonly used pharmacological inhibitor of
LOX has been BAPN, an organic compound that is active in the
mid-micromolar range, but which does not have drug-like
properties and is thus not suitable for further pharmacological
development. Here, we describe CCT365623, a LOX inhibitor
that has clinical development potential. We confirm that
CCT365623 inhibits purified LOX in vitro. We also developed
a biosensor that measures LOX activity against its natural
substrates and show that CCT365623 inhibits this biosensor in
living cells grown in a 3D culture system. Moreover, like BAPN or
genetic ablation of LOX in cells, CCT365623 disrupts HTRA1
multimerization, activates TGFb1 signalling, suppresses MATN2
expression, suppresses EGFR surface retention, and suppresses
EGFR signalling. Finally, like BAPN or genetic ablation of LOX,
CCT365623 downregulates MATN2 and inhibits EGFR plasma
membrane localization in tumours, and it suppresses tumour
growth and metastasis in mice.
Thus, we show that CCT365623 is a LOX inhibitor both
biochemically against the isolated enzyme and in living cells.
In vitro and in vivo it recapitulates the biological effects of both
BAPN and LOX depletion. The catalytic domains of LOX and the
other family proteins (LOX-like protein1–4) are highly conserved,
and some of these are known to be inhibited by BAPN28. It is
therefore likely that CCT365623 inhibits these LOX-like enzymes
and an assessment of the selectivity against other unrelated
enzymes is ongoing. However, in the absence of crystal structures,
we do not understand how BAPN or CCT365623 bind to LOX,
and so it is not possible to generate LOX mutants that are
resistant to these agents for in vitro and in vivo testing.
Nevertheless, our data suggest that like BAPN, CCT365623 is
a LOX inhibitor that modulates the biological functions of LOX
in cells and has anti-tumour activity in mice. Moreover,
CCT365623 is more potent than BAPN and it displays superior
selectivity against serum DAO. It has promising drug-like
properties
with
good
liver
microsome
stability,
oral
bio-availability, robust pharmacokinetic properties and it is well
tolerated in mice. Therefore, CCT365623 is a useful inhibitor to
help improve our understanding of LOX biology.
HTRA1 is a trimer that is known to form higher-order
complexes (multimers) that drive its activation and critically,
we show that LOX induces HTRA1 multimerization. Using
GFP-trapping followed by mass spectrometry and western
blotting, we show that LOX binds to HTRA1. In cells we show
that LOX depletion by RNA interference, or its inhibition by
CCT365623 or BAPN impairs the formation of the HTRA1
multimers. This suggests that LOX activity is needed to induce
HTRA1 multimerization, and accordingly we show that HTRA1
binds to wild-type LOX but not catalytically inactive LOX, or
LOX that cannot be cleaved to the mature active form by BMP-1.
We show that when LOX is depleted, TGFb1 signalling is
activated and MATN2 expression is reduced. Similarly, when
LOX is inhibited by CCT365623 or BAPN, TGFb1 signalling is
activated and MATN2 expression reduced. Moreover, treatment
of the cells with TGFb1 suppresses MATN2 expression, whereas
inhibition
of
the
TGFb1R
increases
MATN2
expression.
Critically, addition of recombinant HTRA1 is sufficient to
suppress TGFb1 signalling and induce MATN2 expression when
LOX is depleted. Altogether these data suggest that LOX activates
HTRA1 by inducing higher-order complexes and that HTRA1
inhibits TGFb1 signalling to increase MATN2 expression.
We show that MATN2 increases EGFR activation by EGF.
Although we were unable to show direct binding of MATN2 to
EGFR in vitro, we show that EGF and an EGFR neutralizing
antibody compete with MATN2 for binding to the cell surface,
suggesting direct binding of MATN2 to the EGFR. In support of
this is the observation that MATN2 contains 10 EGF-like
domains, and accordingly MATN2 depletion reduces EGFR
retention at the cell surface, whereas addition of recombinant
MATN2 to cells increases EGFR retention at the cell surface.
Critically, when LOX is depleted EGFR retention at the cell
surface is reduced, but this was reversed by addition of
recombinant MATN2 to the culture medium. Surprisingly,
despite this evidence for MATN2 binding to EGFR, MATN2
does not activate the receptor, but rather it enhances its activation
by EGF. These data suggest that the function of MATN2 is to trap
EGFR at the cell surface, thereby increasing receptor numbers
and present the receptors to EGF for signalling. Notably, MATN2
is amplified or over expressed in 20% breast cancers and there
is a significant tendency for this to co-occur with EGFR gene
alterations in invasive breast carcinomas29,30. Clearly, it will be
interesting to determine if MATN2 regulates other EGFR family
members and if it regulates heterodimers of EGFR and other
family members.
To conclude, we have identified a molecular function of
extracellular LOX in regulating the EGFR. We identify MATN2
as the key mediator of this pathway and demonstrate that LOX
regulates MATN2 expression through HTRA1 and TGFb1
signalling. We have discovered CCT365623, a LOX inhibitor
with great therapeutic promise that is also valuable for studying
LOX mechanism in vitro and in vivo. We show that pharmaceu-
tical inhibition of LOX disrupts this signalling pathway, reducing
EGFR signalling and delaying tumour progression. CCT365623
and its analogues are undergoing clinical development for use in
LOX driven cancers.

 reagents were purchased from Life Technologies. MDA-MB-231, U87, BJ and
MDCK cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
solution (pen/strep). For stimulation studies, serum starved cells were treated with
100 ng ml � 1 EGF (Peprotech) or 1 mg ml � 1 rhMATN2 (R&D). For TGFb1
treatment, TGFb1 (R&D) was dissolved in water and added to culture medium
at a final concentration of 5 ng ml � 1 for overnight treatment of MDA-MB-231
cells. MDA-MB-231, U87 and MDCK cells were transfected using lipofectamine
3000 according to manufacturer’s instructions. BJ fibroblasts were infected with
lentiviruses (Sigma). Cells were selected with G418 (5 mg ml � 1, Life Technologies)
or puromycin (3 mg ml � 1, Invivogen).
To generate MDCK cysts, cells were cultured on solidified Matrigel (Corning)
for 10 days in DMEM with 10% FBS supplemented with 2% Matrigel.
MDA-MB-231 and U87 cells were cultured on thick collagen gels formed from
acid extracted rat tail collagen type 1 (Corning) to observe matrix deposition, or
embedded in collagen gels for protein analysis. BJ fibroblasts were plated on gelatin
(Sigma) coated glass bottomed dishes (MatTek) for 7 days to allow formation of
cell-derived matrices.
RNA interference. To generate stable LOX-depleted MDA-MB-231 and U87 cell
lines, shLOX A (TTGTTATTGAAAACAGTCC, V3LHS_406838) targeting
human LOX, and shLOX B (ACATCTGTAATATCAATCC, V3LHS_348880)
targeting mouse and human LOX was used and GIPZ non-silencing shRNA
(all from Dharmacon) was used as a control. Stable LOX depletion in BJ fibroblasts
was achieved using a lentivirus (shLOX C) containing human-specific LOX
targeting shRNA (CGACAACCCTTATTACAACTA, TRCN0000045991) and
pLKO.1 non-targeting shRNA was used as control (both from Sigma).
For transient LOX depletion, MDA-MB-231 or U87 cells were transfected
with human specific siLOX#1 (AAGCTGGCTACTCGACATC, SI00036120), or
mouse and human specific siLOX#2 (CTGCACAATTTCACCGTAT, SI00036113)
and for transient MATN2 depletion, siMATN2 (ATGCCGAAGACTTCA
GCACAA, SI04169795) was used. AllStars negative control siRNA (all from
Qiagen) served as control.
Western blotting. Proteins were extracted from cultured cells using cell lysis
buffer (Cell Signalling Technology) with the addition of protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails (Pierce). Protein concentrations were measured using Pierce
660 nm protein assay reagent and a SpectaMax M5 plate reader. Equal amounts of
proteins were separated using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels with NuPAGE MOPS
SDS running buffer (Life Technologies). Separated proteins were transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans-Blot turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad).
Following blocking with Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-COR), membranes were
incubated with two primary antibodies of different species at 4 �C over night. The
following primary antibodies were used, anti-human LOX (1:500; Sigma, L4794)
and anti-tubulin (1:5,000; Sigma, T9026), anti-human MATN2 (1:500; R&D,
AF3044), anti-EGFR (1:2,000; Cell Signalling Technology, 4267) and anti-
pY1068EGFR (1:1,000; Cell Signalling Technology, 3777), anti-GFP (1:2,000; Cell
Signalling Technology, 2956) and anti-GAPDH (1:10,000; Millipore, CB1001-
500UG). Corresponding fluorescence secondary antibodies (1:5,000; Li-COR) were
used to visualize the protein of interest on an Odyssey CLx infrared imaging system
(Li-COR). Quantification of band fluorescent intensity was achieved using Li-COR
ImageStudio. All protein band fluorescent intensity quantifications were normal-
ized to its internal controls (GAPDH or Tubulin). To determine phospho/total
protein ratio, band fluorescent intensity was first normalized to corresponding
internal controls. Then the ratio was calculated. To determine surface EGFR/total
EGFR ratio, a cell lysis sample was divided, so that equal amount of proteins was
used for surface EGFR isolation and for total EGFR detection. The surface EGFR/
total EGFR ratio was then calculated: surface EGFR/total EGFR/GAPDH.
Homotrimeric HTRA1 in cell culture medium was resolved using Blue
NativePAGE (Life Technologies). Extracellular proteins in 15 ml serum-free cell

 culture medium with protease inhibitors added was first concentrated using
Vivaspin protein concentrator spin columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Proteins in concentrated culture medium were then separated using NativePAGE
3–12% Bis-Tris Gel and NativePAGE running buffer (Life Technologies). Separated
proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans-Blot
turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad) as normal. This is then followed by standard
blotting procedures as described above. Anti-human HTRA1 antibody
(1:500; R&D, MAB2916) was then used to detect native HTRA1 proteins.
Uncropped full scans of blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7.
Quantitative real time PCR. RNA was extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed to
generate complementary DNA using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Sigma).
Real-time qRT-PCR was performed with FastStart Universal Probe Master (Rox)
(Roche) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assay probes on an Applied Biosystems
7900HT Fast Real Time machine. Relative MATN2 (hs00242753_m1, Life
Technologies) expression was calculated using the DCt method and housekeeping
genes (GAPDH) as an internal control.
Immunofluorescence. All samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (EMS).
Fixed cells were subjected to incubation with primary antibodies followed by
fluorescence secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) to visualize extracellular
proteins. For visualization of intracellular proteins, fixed cells were permeabilized
using 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) before primary and secondary antibody
incubations. The following primary antibodies were used at 1:100 dilutions,
anti-collagen type1 (Abcam, ab34710), anti-human MATN2 (R&D, AF3044) and
anti-pSMAD2 (Millipore, AB3849). Alexa Fluor 594 Phalloidin (Life Technologies)
was used for actin staining. DAPI or Hoechst (Sigma) was used to stain DNA.
Confocal imaging and imaging analysis. All photomicrographs were taken with
a Leica TCS SP8 X confocal system. Where necessary, fluorescence intensity was
measured as grey values using Fiji. Statistical significance of grey value differences
between samples was tested using Student’s t-test. For LOX biosensor imaging, the
oxidized biosensor was excited using a 405 nm laser, while the reduced biosensor
was excited with a 488 nm laser. Emission of the biosensor was recorded at
500–530 nm using sequential scans. Ratio images were generated following
a published protocol31. Note, while the published protocol generates YFP/CFP ratio
images, we used it to generate oxidized/reduced (oxidized roGFP2 signal) ratio
images.
To image extracellular MATN2, MDA-MB-231 or U87 cells were culture on
collagen gels as described in cell culture and transfection section. BJ fibroblasts
CDM was also generated as described in cell culture and transfection section.
Samples were then fixed and stained with anti-human MATN2 and Hoechst. For
each sample, 15 random fields of views were taken from three repeats. MATN2
fluorescence intensity per image was calculated using Fiji. The number of cells
present in each image were counted based on DAPI staining and GFP expression,
so that the MATN2 fluorescence intensity could be normalized to cell number.
To quantify nuclear pSMAD2 fluorescence intensity, cell nucleus was first
selected based on DAPI staining. pSMAD2 fluorescence intensity in the selected
region was then measured using Fiji. 30 cells were randomly selected per condition.
In order to quantify the fluorescence intensity in tumour samples, 3–5 images
were acquired per tumour section depending on the actual size. An average
fluorescence intensity of MATN2 and EGFR staining were then calculated using
values from individual images. This average florescence intensity was used to
represent MATN2 and EGFR levels in a given tumour.
PathScan RTK signalling antibody array. Cell lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells
cultured in 3D collagen gel were collected using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signalling
Technology) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Pierce). PathScan
RTK signalling antibody arrays (Cell Signalling Technology, 7949) were used
according to manufacturer’s instructions using equal amounts of proteins. The
fluorescent readout was recorded on an Odyssey CLx infrared imaging system
(Li-COR). Quantification of the array fluorescent intensity was achieved using
Li-COR ImageStudio.
AKT activation assay. Serum starved MDA-MB-231 or U87 cells were stimulated
with 100 ng ml � 1 EGF. Cells were then lysed as usual. Equal amounts of proteins
were used for AKT activation analysis using a pS473AKT/total AKT ELISA kit
(Abcam) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

 Labelling and detection of surface EGFR. Following 100 ng ml � 1 EGF stimu-
lation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with ice-cold
0.24 mg ml � 1 Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 �C. Excess
Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin was blocked using 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS and washed using
ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed and protein concentrations determined as described
above. Biotinylated proteins from equal amounts of cell extract were captured
at room temperature using NeutrAvidin Agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h and
analysed by western blotting.
Cloning of LOX expression constructs. Mouse LOX cDNA was purchased from
OriGene. Full length LOX cDNA was PCR cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech),
or proGFP2-N1 (Jim Remington, University of Oregon) using the following
primers, GAGAGAGCTAGCATGCGTTTCGCCTGGG (forward primer) and
TCTCTCCTCGAGATACGGTGAAATTGTGCAGCC (reverse primer). For the
insertion into pEGFP-N1 or proGFP2-N1, NheI and XhoI restriction sites were
added to forward and reverse primers accordingly. Mutant LOX constructs were
made using QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies)
following manufacturer’s instruction using LOX-GFP as template. To create
LOXK314A-GFP, the following primer pair was used, GAGTGGCTGAAGGCCA
CGCAGCAAGCTTCTGTCTGG (sense), and CCAGACAGAAGCTTGCTGC
GTGGCCTTCAGCCACTC (antisense). For LOXDBMP-1-GFP, CAGCCACAT
AGATCGCCCCTACAAGTACTCCG (sense) and CGGAGTACTTGTAGGGG
CGATCTATGTGGCTG (antisense) was used. To generate, roGFP2 versions of
LOX mutant constructs, LOX mutant cDNA was transferred from pEGFP-N1 to
proGFP2-N1 using NheI and XhoI. Finally, LOX signal peptide was PCR cloned
into pEGFP-N1 vector to make a secreted GFP (sGFP) expression construct using
GAGAGAGCTAGCATGCGTTTCGCCTGGG (forward primer) and
TCTCTCCTCGAGCGGGGCGCAGCGGAGAA (reverse primer).
Co-immunoprecipitation of extracellular LOX-binding proteins. MDA-MB-231
cells with stable expression of LOX-GFP, LOXK314A-GFP, LOXDBMP-1-GFP and
sGFP were used to immunoprecipitate LOX proteins from culture medium.
Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry
or by western blotting. The band intensity of MATN2 or HTRA1 was normalized
to corresponding band intensities of precipitated LOX-GFP proteins as an
indication of relative binding strength.
Identification of extracellular proteins that bind to LOX-GFP. MDA-MB-231
cells with stable expression of LOX-GFP, LOXK314A-GFP, LOXDBMP-1-GFP and
sGFP were used to immunoprecipitate LOX proteins from culture medium. For
each immunoprecipitation, 45 ml culture medium was collected from three
confluent 150 mm cell culture dishes. Protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche) were
added immediately following medium collection. Debris in medium was removed
by centrifugation. Cleared cell culture medium was then incubated with 50 ml
GFP-Trap agarose beads (ChromoTek) overnight at 4 �C. Agarose beads were
then washed according to manufacturer’s protocol. Immunoprecipitated proteins
were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) for western
blots or staining with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Life Technologies).
For analysis by mass spectrometry, SimplyBlue-stained gel slices were destained
with 3 � 20 min changes of 1 ml 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 40% (v/v)
acetonitrile. Gel slices were dehydrated by the addition of 500 ml acetonitrile for
15 min followed by rehydration in 500 ml of water for a further 15 min. This
dehydration–rehydration procedure was performed three times followed by a final
dehydration in acetonitrile.
Gel slices were rehydrated in 25 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 9% (v/v)
acetonitrile, and 20 ng ml � 1 sequencing grade trypsin (Sigma) for 20 min. The
slices were then covered in 100 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 9% (v/v)
acetonitrile and incubated at 37� for 18 h. Following digestion, samples were
acidified by the addition of 10 ml of 10% (v/v) formic acid. The isolated supernatant
was dried in a vacuum centrifuge at 40 �C for 30 min and the released peptides
were resuspended in 2 ml of water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.
LC–MS/MS analyses were performed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometer with EasySpray source coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano
system (Thermo Scientific). Samples were loaded directly onto the analytical
column, PepMap RSLC C18, 2 mm � 75 mm id � 50 cm (Thermo Scientific)
maintained at 60 �C. The composition (v/v) of LC buffers was: buffer A—water
plus 0.1% formic acid; buffer B—80% acetonitrile, 19.9% water and 0.1% formic
acid. Peptides were loaded directly onto the column at a flow rate of 300 nl min � 1
with an initial mobile phase composition of 1% B. The organic strength was
increased linearly from 1 to 22.5% B over 20 min again at 300 nl min � 1, followed
by an increase to 40% B over the next 3 min. A further increase to 80% B over
the next 5 min was followed by a hold phase for 5 min before returning to 1% B for
22 min. The mass spectrometer was instructed to perform data dependent
acquisition on the top six precursor ions, which were measured in the Orbitrap
FTMS detector over the mass range 370–1,200 m/z, at a nominal resolution of
60,000. MS/MS spectra were acquired in the ion trap under CID conditions
with normalized collision energy of 35, isolation width of 3 Th, Q value of
0.25 and 30 ms activation time.
MATN2 cell surface-binding assay. To detect cell surface binding of MATN2,
500 ng ml � 1 rhMATN2 was incubated with MDA-MB-231 cells in glass bottom
dishes (MatTek) for 30 min. Culture medium was then removed. Cells were then
washed with ice cold PBS before fixation and staining for immunofluorescence
and confocal imaging.
MATN2 cell surface-binding competition assays. To demonstrate EGFR
dependent cell surface binding of MATN2, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in
glass bottom dishes (MatTek) at 37 �C and serum starved cells were pre-treated
with 20 mg ml � 1 control mouse IgG1 (Millipore, MABC002) or 0.075–20 mg ml � 1
mouse anti-EGFR, clone LA1 neutralizing antibody (Millipore, 05-101) for 30 min.
Overall, 500 ng ml � 1 rhMATN2 was then added (without diluting the competing
antibody) to cells for a further 30 min. Samples were washed in ice cold PBS and
fixed for immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. Images were acquired
randomly. Experiments were repeated three times, and a total of 50 fields of views
were taken per condition. The average fluorescence intensity per condition was
then calculated using the 50 images.
EGF was also used to compete with rhMATN2 (R&D) for cell surface binding
to EGFR. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured and serum starved as described above.
Before the competition assay, cells were washed with ice cold PBS and left on ice.
Either 500 ng ml � 1 rhMATN2 in PBS or a mixture of 500 mg ml � 1 rhMATN2 and
15–500 ng ml � 1 EGF (Alexa Flour 647 EGF, Life Technologies) in PBS was used to
treat cells on ice for 30 min. Samples were then washed with ice cold PBS and fixed
for immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. Images were acquired randomly.
Experiments were repeated three times, and a total of 50 fields of views were taken
per condition. The average fluorescence intensity per condition was then calculated
using the 50 images.
Cell proliferation assay. 2000 MDA-MB-231 or U87 cells were seeded into
96-well plates and cultured under indicated conditions. Cell proliferation was
determined by CellTiter-Glo luminescence (Promage) according to manufacturer’s
instructions on indicated days. Data were normalized to day 1. Student’s t-test was
used to calculate the statistical significance.
Animal procedures. All procedures involving animals were performed under
licence PPL-70/7701, 70/6730 and 70/7635, in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines
and National Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act 1986. Procedures were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review
Bodies (AWERB) of the CRUK Manchester Institute and the Institute of Cancer
Research, and tumour volumes did not exceed the guidelines set by the Committee
of the National Cancer Research Institute24 as stipulated by the AWERB.
Lung deposition assay. 8-week old female CD1 nude mice (Charles River) were
injected intravenously with 1 � 105 of either control (n ¼ 7) or LOX-depleted
(n ¼ 7) MDA-MB-231 cells in PBS. Randomization to groups was by non-statistical
methods and sample number per group was based on past experimental results.
Mice were monitored unblinded for up to 50 days post-injection and humanely
killed at the end of the experiment, or when animals showed signs of ill health.
Lungs were collected post-mortem.
LOX inhibitor treatment on mouse breast cancer model. MMTV-PyMT32
(FVB) female mice were randomized by non-statistical methods to LOX inhibitor
treatment groups from day 70 post-birth, when animals had no detectable tumour.
Mice were treated daily by oral gavage with 70 mg kg � 1 CCT365623 (n ¼ 6) or
70 mg kg � 1 BAPN (3-aminopropionitrile fumarate, Fisher Scientific) (n ¼ 4) in
vehicle (5% DMSO/2.5% Tween20 in water) or controls with vehicle alone (n ¼ 6).
An alternative group of n ¼ 7 were given 0.01 g ml � 1 (1% w/v) BAPN in drinking
water or untreated drinking water for n ¼ 7 additional controls. The water intake of
an adult mouse isB3.64 ml day � 1 and an adult mouse weighs around 25 g, thus
the BAPN therapy dose is calculated as follows: 0.01 � 3.64 ml per 25 g ¼ 0.0364 g
per 25 g ¼ 1,460 mg kg � 1. Sample number per group was based on past
experimental results. Tumour size was determined unblinded by caliper
measurements of tumour length, width and depth and volume was calculated as
0.5236 � length � width � depth (mm). In all experiments, mice were humanely
killed and mammary tumours and lungs collected when the primary tumours
reached ethical size limits or signs of ill health.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. All mouse tissue samples were fixed in
10% formalin (Sigma) and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned, and
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained using standard protocols. H&E stained
samples were imaged with a Leica DM4000 upright microscope. To quantify
malignant deposits in the lungs following intravenous injection of MDA-MB-231
cells, the proportion of lung parenchyma occupied was assessed and scored
as described in Supplementary Table 1. The investigator was blinded to the
experimental groups. For spontaneous lung metastasis in MMTV-PyMT animals
treated with either water or BAPN, we counted the number of lung metastasis in
the lung parenchyma ranked by size and a lung metastasis score was assigned

 accordingly as described in Supplementary Table 4. The investigator was blinded
to the experimental groups. Anti-Mouse MATN2 (R&D, AF3044) was used at
1:100 dilution. Anti-EGFR (Abcam, ab52894) was used at 1:200 dilution to stain
sectioned mouse tissue samples. Corresponding fluorescence secondary antibodies
(Life Technologies) were then used for staining for confocal imaging of tissue
samples.
LOX inhibitor. The synthetic route of CCT365623 (compound 2 in Fig. 6a) is
detailed in Supplementary Methods. For LOX inhibition assays in cell culture,
BAPN was dissolved in water and CCT365623 was dissolved in DMSO. Cells were
treated at indicated concentrations overnight, with the exception of the MDCK
cysts which were treated with LOX inhibitors just before imaging.
In vitro pig skin LOX HRP enzyme activity assay. LOX enzyme was extracted
from pig skin33. The following procedures were all performed at 4 �C. Pig skins
were minced and mixed in PBS (0.09 M Na2HPO4; 0.01 M NaH2PO4; 0.15 M NaCl,
pH 7.8) using a large food mixer. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 min.
Pellets were collected and washed in PB (PBS without NaCl) and re-suspended in
10 mM CuCl2 in PBU (PB with 6 M urea) and stirred over night using a magnetic
stirrer. Supernatant was collected next day after centrifugation at 10,000g for
20 min. LOX protein was purified from the supernatant using AKTAexplorer
100 (GE) fitted with a XK Column (GE, XK26/100) filed with DEAE Sepharose
Fast Flow (GE). Flow rate was set at 2.5 (B1 ml min � 1). The XK Column was
washed with PB. LOX protein was eluted using PBU.
Pig skin LOX enzyme was diluted according to specific pre-determined activity
in assay buffer (100 mM CHES, pH 9, 0.05% (w/v) pluronic F-127, 0.5% (w/v) BSA,
1 mM MgCl2, 1 M urea, 100 mM NaCl). Overall, 0.5 ml test compound was added
to 40 ml assay buffer þ LOX at 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and 0.003 mM
(final concentration) in a 96-well black, flat bottomed plate (Corning) and
incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by addition
of 10 ml freshly prepared start mix (20 mM cadaverine dihydrochloride (Sigma),
20 mM Amplex Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 U ml � 1 horseradish peroxidase
(HRP), final concentration); in assay buffer and the plate was incubated for 45 min
at room temperature, protected from light. Fluorescence was measured at
545/585 nm (Ex/Em) using a SpectaMax M5 plate reader and resulting IC50 values
were calculated using GraphPad Prism software.
In vitro amino oxidase activity assay. The Promega MAO-Glo assay kit was used
to assess MAO-A and MAO-B activity. MAO substrate was prepared at 80 mM with
the specific MAO-A/B reaction buffer. Overall, 0.5 ml test compound was added
to 25 ml MAO substrate at 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and 0.003 mM
(final concentration) in a 96-well white, flat bottom plate. Overall, 25 ml of 1:520
dilution of MAO-A enzyme (Promega, V1452) or 25 ml of 1:52 dilution of MAO-B
enzyme (Sigma, M7441) in specific MAO-A/B reaction buffer was added to each
well (enzyme prepared at 2 � final concentration) and plates were incubated for 1 h
at room temperature. Finally, 50 ml per well luciferin detection reagent was added
and plates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, protected from light.
Luminescence was measured with an integration time of 500 ms per well using
a SpectaMax M5 plate reader and resulting IC50 values were calculated using
GraphPad Prism software.
The DAO catalytic activity was determined using the Promega ROS Glo assay
kit, DAO was purchased from Sigma and cadaverine dihydrochloride was used as
the substrate at a concentration of 97.8 mM. The concentrations of the chemical
inhibitors were the same as in the MAO assays. Luminescence was measured with
an integration time of 500 ms/well using a SpectaMax M5 plate reader and
resulting IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software.
Pharmacokinetic analysis. For pharmacokinetic analyses, CCT365623 or BAPN
(50 mg kg � 1 in 5%DMSO/water, PO n ¼ 21 or 10 mg kg � 1 in 5%DMSO/water,
IV n ¼ 24) were administered to mice (6 weeks, female, Balb/C and CD1 nude,
Charles River). CCT365623 blood samples were collected at time points from
5 min–8 h post dose from the tail vein using 20 ml heparinized capillaries then
pipetted onto Whatman FTA DMPK-B cards (GE Healthcare) and left to dry
overnight. BAPN blood samples were collected at the same time points, then
the plasma pipetted into cryovials, immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at � 80 �C overnight.
CCT365623 and BAPN solutions (10 mM in DMSO) were used to make stock
standard curve (SC) and quality control (QC) solutions at appropriate
concentrations. Blank blood (for CCT365623) or blank plasma (for BAPN) was
spiked with stock solutions to produce a final SC concentration of 10, 50, 100, 500
1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 nM; with final QC concentrations of 250 and 7,500 nM. For
CCT365623 SC blood (20 ml) and QC blood (20 ml) was pipetted onto Whatman
FTA DMPK-B cards (GE Healthcare) and left to dry overnight. To extract,
samples, SC and QC blood spots were punched from Whatman cards with Harris
unicore 6 mm punch (GE Healthcare) and placed in a 1 ml 96-well plate. Methanol
(200 ml) containing internal standard was added. Samples were vortex mixed for
10 min then centrifuged at 3,700 r,p,m., 4 �C for 5 min. Owing to its small size,
a dansyl derivative of BAPN was used in PK analysis34. For BAPN derivatization,
10 ml SC samples; 10 ml QC samples; and 10 ml of 1:10 plasma dilution samples;
were each mixed with 20 ml dansyl chloride (10 mg ml � 1 in acetone) and 20 ml
sodium bicarbonate (100 mM, pH 11). The samples were incubated for 10 min
at 60 �C. 50 ml distilled water was then added before centrifugation at 14,000g
for 10 min. To extract the derivatized BAPN, a solid phase extraction plate
(Supelco Protein precipitation plate) was conditioned under vacuum with 1 ml
deionized water and 1 ml methanol. Overall, 85 ml supernatant from the samples
was added to the plate and the cartridge washed with 100 ml methanol:water
(30:70). Elution was carried out with 200 ml methanol (with formic acid at 2%).
The samples were evaporated under nitrogen and then reconstituted in 30 ml
methanol:water (30:70). The plate was vortex mixed and centrifuged for 5 min
at 3,700 r.p.m. Extracted samples from BAPN and CCT365623 were then diluted
for analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for
the compound concentrations. Non-compartmental analysis was performed on
concentration data by computer software WinNonlin v6.3.
Liver microsome metabolism. A cofactor incubation solution containing 10 mM
PBS, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM NADH, and 2 mM NADPH was prepared. Microsomes
(BALB/c, custom batch, Tebu-bio), were added to the cofactor solution as
a 1:20 dilution from 0.5 mg ml � 1 solution. The required compounds were diluted
to 10 mM in the cofactor solution containing microsomes. Microsome-incubated
samples were assessed at 0, 15 and 30 min. Control samples containing no
microsomes and no cofactors were also assessed at 0 and 30 min. Samples were
extracted by protein precipitation, and centrifugation for 20 min in a refrigerated
centrifuge (4 �C) at 3,700 r.p.m. The supernatant was analysed by LC–MS/MS for
the compound concentrations, and % metabolized over time was calculated.
Statistics. Student’s t-test was used to calculate significance of differences in
all experiments except lung deposit score and lung metastasis score, for which
non-parametric Mann–Whitney analysis was used. All tests were two-sided.
In Student’s t-test, a P value o0.01 was considered significant. While in the
non-parametric Mann–Whitney analysis, a P value o0.05 was considered
significant. All statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel or
GraphPad Prism.
