Abstract
Background: The outcomes for planned homebirth in Victoria are unknown. We aimed to compare the rates of
outcomes for high risk and low risk women who planned to birth at home compared to those who planned to
birth in hospital.
Methods: We undertook a population based cohort study of all births in Victoria, Australia 2000–2015. Women
were defined as being of low or high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes according to the eligibility criteria for
homebirth and either planning to birth at home or in a hospital setting at the at the onset of labour. Rates of
perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity as well as obstetric interventions were compared.
Results: Three thousand nine hundred forty-five women planned to give birth at home with a privately practising
midwife and 829,286 women planned to give birth in a hospital setting. Regardless of risk status, planned
homebirth was associated with significantly lower rates of all obstetric interventions and higher rates of
spontaneous vaginal birth (p ≤ 0.0001 for all). For low risk women the rates of perinatal mortality were similar
(1.6 per 1000 v’s 1.7 per 1000; p = 0.90) and overall composite perinatal (3.6% v’s 13.4%; p ≤ 0.001) and maternal
morbidities (10.7% v’s 17.3%; p ≤ 0.001) were significantly lower for those planning a homebirth. Planned homebirth
among high risk women was associated with significantly higher rates of perinatal mortality (9.3 per 1000 v’s 3.5 per
1000; p = 0.009) but an overall significant decrease in composite perinatal (7.8% v’s 16.9%; p ≤ 0.001) and maternal
morbidities (16.7% v’s 24.6%; p ≤ 0.001).
Conclusion: Regardless of risk status, planned homebirth was associated with significantly lower rates of obstetric
interventions and combined overall maternal and perinatal morbidities. For low risk women, planned homebirth
was also associated with similar risks of perinatal mortality, however for women with recognized risk factors,
planned homebirth was associated with significantly higher rates of perinatal mortality.

Introduction
Only 1 in 200 women have a homebirth in Victoria,
Australia. This is despite international evidence that for
healthy normal pregnant women, home birth is not asso-
ciated with an increased rate of adverse perinatal out-
comes [1–7], or maternal morbidity [1, 3–8] compared
to similar women having a planned hospital birth, par-
ticularly if they are multiparous [9]. Whether homebirth
is safe for women at high risk of adverse pregnancy out-
comes is less clear. Findings from studies in populations
which were mixed with regards to risk status report
higher rates of adverse perinatal outcomes compared to
similar women in hospital [10, 11]. In contrast those that
specifically looked at high risk women, identified a re-
duction in adverse outcomes and obstetric interventions
[12] or no difference (apart from a higher vaginal birth
rate) in outcomes [13]. Homebirth in England however
is more common and integrated into the health system.
Whether these findings from England apply to Australia
is not clear.

 In 2013 a perinatal death occurred in Victoria during a
planned homebirth in a woman who was identified as
being at high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Fol-
lowing the investigation of this case a coronial recom-
mendation (Coroner Parkinson 2013) was made for the
Health Minister to investigate and provide information
about the rates of outcomes for planned homebirth in
Victoria. This research directly addresses the coroner’s
recommendation.
We aimed to quantify the number of women who
planned to birth at home in Victoria between 2000 and
2015, to quantify transfer rates to hospital, and to com-
pare the rates of perinatal and maternal outcomes and
obstetric interventions for women who planned to birth
at home compared to those who planned to birth within
a hospital setting by maternal ‘risk’ status.
Methods
We undertook a study using data that are legislatively
routinely reported on all births in Victoria, Australia to
the Victorian Perinatal Data Collection (VPDC). For
every birth ≥20 weeks gestation(or ≥ 400 g birth weight
if gestation not known), regardless of place of birth the
VPDC receives a standardized report detailing over 100
items regarding maternal characteristics, obstetric condi-
tions, procedures and outcomes, perinatal mortality and
morbidity and birth defects.
De-identified data for all births from ≥37 weeks
gestational age from 2000 to 2015 were extracted. Ba-
bies with congenital anomalies or where a caesarean
birth was planned were excluded. The majority of
planned home births in Victoria occur under the care
of a privately practising midwife. Two small public
homebirth programs, caring for about 90 women a
year in total, were established in 2014. Due to the
small numbers and because they have only been oper-
ating for two of the 16 years studied, we excluded
them from analyses. Women were identified as being
of low or high risk informed by the Australian Col-
lege of Midwives(ACM) guidelines for consultation
and referral [14]. These are the criteria referenced in
public funded homebirth programs to inform eligibil-
ity for planned homebirth.
Specifically, a high risk pregnancy was defined as: a
multiple pregnancy, a post-term (> 41 + 6 weeks of gesta-
tion) pregnancy, a non-cephalic presentation in labour,
obesity(BMI Class 2 or greater: data only available from
2009 onwards), a prior caesarean, previous uterine sur-
gery, grand multiparity(≥5 previous births), any signifi-
cant maternal medical condition such as pre-existing
diabetes, hypertension, renal, cardiac, liver, respiratory,
endocrine, immunological, renal, or gastrointestinal dis-
ease as determined by individual ICD-10 codes. All other
women were classified as having a low risk pregnancy.
Women were grouped by their planned place of birth
at the beginning of labour. This was done by utilising
the VPDC fields planned place of birth, changed intent
of planned place of birth, and timing (antepartum/intra-
partum) of changed intent. Additional checks were done
to determine who reported the birth also, specifically
looking for the codes that identified privately practising
midwives. The planned hospital group also includes
birth centre births. For the period of this study however
all birth centre births were integrated within a larger
hospital health service.
Data were largely complete. Where data were missing
a ‘not reported’ variable was used. BMI data were only
available from 2009 onwards. Validation of the accuracy
of the dataset has been reported [15]. For the variables
used in this study that have been validated (demograph-
ics, mortality outcomes and obstetric interventions), all
had accuracy above 90% except for BMI.
Statistical analyses
The number of women who, at the onset of labour
planned to give birth at home were tabulated and
graphed by risk status and overall by year. The charac-
teristics of the women and the frequency of risk factors
in the high risk pregnancy group were tabulated. Actual
place of birth was used to determine transfer rates. The
rates of perinatal and maternal outcomes and obstetric
interventions by planned place of birth and risk status
were determined using the Chi2 test. The denominator
for perinatal outcomes was the number of babies born,
for maternal outcomes and obstetric outcomes it was
the number of women who gave birth. A small number,
0.4%, of planned hospital births are born before arrival
but were not excluded from the dataset. All statistical
analyses were undertaken using Stata/IC 12.1 for Mac
(College Station, TX USA). A p value < 0.05(2-tailed)
was regarded as statistically significant.
Results
From 2000 to 2015, 3945 women planned to give birth
at home with a privately practising midwife and 829,286
women planned to give birth in hospital. Of those who
planned to give birth at home 3202(81%) were identified
as having a low risk pregnancy and 743(19%) were iden-
tified as having a high risk pregnancy. Of those planning
a hospital birth 701,058(85%) were identified as low risk
and 128,228(15%) were identified as high risk. The num-
ber of women planning a homebirth, regardless of risk
status, increased from 131 per annum in 2000 to 315
per annum in 2015. This reflected a 2.6 fold and 1.8 fold
increase for low risk and high risk women, respectively
(Fig. 1). The characteristics of the women are presented
in Table 1. Regardless of risk status, women who
planned a homebirth were older, had a normal BMI,

 were Australian-born, were parous and were of higher
socioeconomic
status
compared
to
their
equivalent
group who planned to give birth in hospital. Of the 3202
low risk and 743 high risk mother-baby pairs who
planned a home birth, 2888(90%) and 628(83%) gave
birth at home.
Table 2 summarises the frequencies of risk factors for
women with high risk pregnancies. Among women who
planned to birth at home, 75(10%) had more than one
risk factor and among the planned hospital group
16,438(12.5%) did. The most common risk factors for
those who planned to birth at home were having had a
previous caesarean birth (41.9%) and being post term
(32.5%). For high risk women who planned to give birth
in hospital having a pre-existing medical condition was
the most common risk factor (31%) followed by having
had a previous caesarean delivery (28.8%).
Perinatal outcomes (Table 3)
There were no statistically significant differences in the
stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates, low 5 min Apgar
score, HIE or other perinatal morbidities between low
risk women who planned to give birth at home com-
pared to those who planned to give birth in hospital.
The rate of admission to NICU was significantly higher
in the planned homebirth group (0.44% v’s 0.20%, p =
0.03), while rates of admission to SCN(1.8% v’s to 8.3%,
p < 0.001), birth trauma(1.4% v’s 6.6%, p < 0.001), intra-
uterine hypoxia(1.5% v’s 5.8%, p < 0.001) and the com-
posite perinatal morbidity(3.6% v’s 13.4%, p < 0.001)
were significantly lower.
For high risk women there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference in the rate of stillbirth between women
who planned to birth at home compared to those who
planned to birth in hospital but the rate of neonatal
death was 7.2-fold higher (5.3 per 1000 v’s 0.74 per
1000, p < 0.001) and the rate of NICU admission was
4-fold higher (1.6% v’s 0.4%, p < 0.001). In contrast, the
rates of admission to SCN (4.4% v’s 13.7%, p < 0.001),
birth trauma(3.1% v’s 7.6%, p < 0.001), intrauterine hyp-
oxia(3.2% v’s 6.6%, p < 0.001) and composite perinatal
morbidity(7.8% v’s 16.9%, p < 0.001) were significantly
lower in the planned homebirth group. There were no
statistical differences in low (< 7) 5 min Apgar score,
HIE or other perinatal morbidity between the groups.
Risk factors identified in the perinatal deaths among
high risk planned hospital birth were “maternal medical
complications” (35% of the perinatal deaths), previous
caesarean (28% of the perinatal deaths); non-cephalic
presentations (22% of the perinatal deaths), twin preg-
nancies (11% of the perinatal deaths) and a BMI of over
35 (16% of the perinatal deaths). Multiple risk factors
existed for women in hospital with past caesarean, ma-
ternal obesity and maternal medical conditions fre-
quently co-existing. In regards to women at home past
caesarean and being post term were the most common
risk factors.
Maternal and obstetric outcomes (Table 4)
There was one maternal death among women who
planned to give birth at home and 23 among those who
planned to give birth in hospital.
Low risk women who planned a home birth were sig-
nificantly more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal
birth(94.9% v’s 70%, p < 0.001). For low risk women,
planned home birth was associated with a significantly
lower rate of maternal HDU/ICU admission (0.2% v’s
0.6%; p = 0.002), severe perineal trauma (1.0% v’s 2.0%; p
< 0.001), postpartum haemorrhage(9.1% v’s 12.9%; p <
0.001), blood transfusion(0.3% v’s 0.7%; p = 0.005), man-
ual removal of placenta(0.9% v’s 2.5%; p < 0.001) and
intrapartum haemorrhage(0.1% v’s 0.4%; p = 0.01). The
rates of unplanned caesarean (2.5% v’s 12.5%; < 0.001),
assisted vaginal birth(2.5% v’s 17.5%; p < 0.001), epidural
analgesia(3.2%

27.5%;
p < 0.001),
general
anaes-
thetic(0.2% v’s 0.96%; p < 0.001), and episiotomy(2.9% v’s
21.2%;
p < 0.001)
were
significantly
lower
in
those
women planning to give birth at home.
High risk women who planned a home birth were also
significantly more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal
birth than those who planned a hospital birth (86.1% v’s
53.2%; p < 0.001). Among high risk women, planning to

 birth at home was associated with a significantly lower
rate of postpartum haemorrhage(14.5% v’s 19.6%; p <
0.001) and composite maternal morbidity (a combin-
ation of all maternal morbidities combined) (16.7% v’s
24.6%; p < 0.001) than planned hospital birth. Obstetric
interventions were also significantly less common among
the high risk women who had planned a home birth
compared to those who planned a hospital birth: un-
planned caesarean(8.9% v’s 32.4%; < 0.001), assisted vagi-
nal birth(4.6% v’s 14.4%; p < 0.001), epidural(5.4% v’s
27.5%; p < 0.001), general anaesthetic(0.5% v’s 2.7%; p <
0.001), and episiotomy(4.0% v’s 15.9%; p < 0.001).
Discussion
Overall we found that home birth, regardless of risk sta-
tus, was associated with significantly lower rates of ob-
stetric interventions and combined overall maternal and
perinatal morbidities. For low risk women planned
homebirth was also associated with similar risks of
perinatal mortality, however for women with recognized
risk factors, planned homebirth was associated with sig-
nificantly higher rates of perinatal mortality.
Until
now,
the
outcomes
from
home
births
in
Victoria, particularly among “high risk” women was
unknown. We found that for women with risk factors
home birth was associated with a significantly in-
creased risk of neonatal death and some perinatal
morbidities. Our findings broadly accord with those
of the Birthplace in England study that showed that
planned homebirth among “high risk” women was as-
sociated with a 2-fold increased risk of a composite
perinatal outcome (intrapartum stillbirth, early neo-
natal death, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, meco-
nium
aspiration
syndrome,
brachial
plexus
injury,
fractured clavicle or humerus and admission to NICU
for greater that 48 h), albeit that increase was not
statistically significant [12]. The Birthplace study also
reported a moderate (1.20 95% CI 0.41–3.44) but

 non-significant increase in risk of adverse perinatal
outcomes among a small number of women planning
a VBAC at home compared to in hospital [13]. Not
all adverse perinatal outcomes were increased in the
planned homebirth group however. High risk women
planning to birth at home experienced significantly
reduced
rates
of
birth
trauma
and
intrauterine
hypoxia. We also observed that high risk women who
planned to birth at home experienced lower rates of
maternal morbidities.
Qualitative studies have been undertaken to under-
stand why women with certain risk factors, particularly
those who have had a previous caesarean choose to birth
at home. These studies identify a recurrent theme that

 women want to avoid another caesarean [16]. Our re-
sults appear to vindicate their fears. In Victoria, high risk
women who planned to birth in hospital had over 3.5
times the rate of unplanned caesarean than those who
planned to birth at home. We were not able to address
whether this difference was clinically justified or not.
However, recently, Dutch investigators aimed to deter-
mine if the differences in intervention rates between
home and hospital births reflected over or under treat-
ment in these groups [17]. They found both. Our find-
ings here and the observation that there is 10-fold
variation in the rate of attempted VBAC rates in mater-
nity units in Victoria [18] would suggest the same is oc-
curring here. There is an urgent need for health services
to reassess their policies and support for women plan-
ning a VBAC to address these discrepancies in care. Pre-
vious research has also identified that women with risk
factors also choose to birth at home, do so following a
traumatic or bad experience in hospital [19]. Addressing
discrepancies in care, and providing support and under-
standing the experiences of women following adverse
pregnancy and labour experiences after giving birth in
hospital is needed. Interestingly, despite much debate
around absolute risk [20], uterine rupture is commonly
cited as a reason that women who have had a previous
caesarean should not plan a vaginal birth [21]. The only
uterine rupture that occurred in the high risk women
who planned a home birth was in a woman who had
had more than one previous caesarean section.
Reporting the outcomes for low risk women planning
a home birth was necessary so that if we found higher
rates of adverse outcomes for high risk women, as we
did, we could consider whether this was a feature of
home birth per se in Victoria. This was not the case.
Perinatal outcomes from planned homebirth in low risk
women were similar to those of planned hospital birth.
The low risk women planning a home birth also had
fewer obstetric interventions and lower rates of maternal
morbidities. Our findings were consistent with other
studies of low risk women giving birth at home [1].
Seventeen percent of high risk and 10% of low risk
women required transfer to hospital. Women and/or ba-
bies requiring a transfer to hospital in labour are consid-
ered at most risk of adverse outcomes [22]. We did not
find that. Instead, we found that the majority of adverse
perinatal outcomes were among the women who actually
gave birth at home. Understanding why this is the case
is needed. A recent survey of intrapartum transfers with
13 Australian midwives identified barriers to timely
transfer of women to hospital [23]. Midwives reported
health services either refusing to accept transfers or
health services/hospital staff being hostile to the mid-
wives when they arrived [23]. This was in contrast to ex-
periences some of these midwives had when they
worked as a homebirth midwife in the UK [23]. The rate
of homebirth in Australia is much lower than the rest of
the world. In Australia only 0.3% of women plan to give
birth at home. This is in contrast to 3.4% of women in
New Zealand, 2% in Canada and the UK, and 20% in the
Netherlands. The organisation of homebirth in Australia
also differs. In Victoria the majority – almost three quar-
ters –of women having a homebirth do so under the
care of a private midwife. This differs from the UK,
Netherlands and New Zealand where homebirth is inte-
grated and offered within the public health care system.
Our study had a number of limitations. Prior to 2009
maternal BMI were not reported in the dataset. It is pos-
sible that low risk women were actually of high risk prior
to 2009. The adverse findings for the low risk women may
therefore be overestimated and for the high risk women
underestimated. Due to small numbers of adverse out-
comes we were unable to stratify our results by parity.
There is also the potential for misclassification of planned
place of birth and risk status. It is possible that some
women with risk factors indicated they planned to give
birth in hospital when in fact they planned to birth at
home or changed their intent and did not notify the hos-
pital. We were also unable to link to past obstetric compli-
cations that would identify a woman as high risk e.g.
previous postpartum haemorrhage. It is possible that the
denominator for planned homebirth for high risk women
is larger than we have reported. Furthermore it is possible
that differences in fetal monitoring that occur at home
(intermittent auscultation) compared to hospital (continu-
ous CTG and possibly fetal scalp lactates) and health ser-
vice preference to directly admit babies to the NICU
rather than SCN may have led to an underestimation of
the rates of intrauterine hypoxia and SCN admission in
the planned homebirth group. This likely explains the dis-
cordance between higher rates of NICU admission, but
lower rates of perinatal morbidity. Caution should be
made interpreting these findings in isolation.
Conclusions
We report the rates of selected perinatal, maternal and
obstetric outcomes in Victorian women with and with-
out risk factors, by their planned place of birth. Our
findings support current guidelines [14, 24–26] and
should be useful to women who are making informed
choices about where to have their baby and to health
services and policy advisors who are planning the
provision of maternity care.
