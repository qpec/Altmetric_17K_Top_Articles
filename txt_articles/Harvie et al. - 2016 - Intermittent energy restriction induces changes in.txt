Abstract
Background: Observational studies suggest weight loss and energy restriction reduce breast cancer risk.
Intermittent energy restriction (IER) reduces weight to the same extent as, or more than equivalent continuous
energy restriction (CER) but the effects of IER on normal breast tissue and systemic metabolism as indicators of
breast cancer risk are unknown.
Methods: We assessed the effect of IER (two days of 65 % energy restriction per week) for one menstrual cycle on
breast tissue gene expression using Affymetrix GeneChips, adipocyte size by morphometry, and systemic
metabolism (insulin resistance, lipids, serum and urine metabolites, lymphocyte gene expression) in 23 overweight
premenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer. Unsupervised and supervised analyses of matched pre and
post IER biopsies in 20 subjects were performed, whilst liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry assessed
corresponding changes in serum and urine metabolites in all subjects after the two restricted and five unrestricted
days of the IER.
Results: Women lost 4.8 % (±2.0 %) of body weight and 8.0 % (±5.0 %) of total body fat. Insulin resistance
(homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)) reduced by 29.8 % (±17.8 %) on the restricted days and by 11 % (±34 %)
on the unrestricted days of the IER. Five hundred and twenty-seven metabolites significantly increased or decreased
during the two restricted days of IER. Ninety-one percent of these returned to baseline after 5 days of normal
eating. Eleven subjects (55 %) displayed reductions in energy restriction-associated metabolic gene pathways
including lipid synthesis, gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis. Some of these women also had increases in
genes associated with breast epithelial cell differentiation (secretoglobulins, milk proteins and mucins) and
decreased collagen synthesis (TNMD, PCOLCE2, TIMP4). There was no appreciable effect of IER on breast gene
expression in the other nine subjects. These groups did not differ in the degree of changes in weight, total body
fat, fat cell size or serum or urine metabolomic markers. Corresponding gene changes were not seen in peripheral
blood lymphocytes.
Conclusion: The transcriptional response to IER is variable in breast tissue, which was not reflected in the systemic
response, which occurred in all subjects. The mechanisms of breast responsiveness/non-responsiveness require
further investigation.

 Background
Observational studies in women indicate that weight
gain increases breast cancer risk and weight reduction
decreases breast cancer risk [1–4]. In the Iowa Women’s
Health Study, ≥5 % maintained weight loss resulted in
20–40 % reduction in postmenopausal breast cancer risk
compared with women who continued to gain weight
[1]. Multiple studies in rodent models also indicate that
energy restriction reduces the risk of breast cancer [5].
This effect appears to be mediated by changes in a num-
ber of systemic factors and also local factors within
breast cells. For example, systemically, energy restriction
is associated with reductions in insulin, leptin and in-
flammatory markers. Within the breast, in general there
is downregulation of metabolic pathways associated with
anabolism and upregulation of pathways associated with
catabolism [6–8]. The aforementioned data suggest en-
ergy restriction would be useful for breast cancer pre-
vention in overweight and obese women. However, poor
adherence to continuous energy restriction (CER) means
energy restriction is difficult to implement.
We previously reported that daily 60 % (3350 kJ) CER
for one menstrual cycle (four to five weeks) reduced
weight, biomarkers of breast cancer risk and altered
gene expression in breast and abdominal adipose tissue
[9]. Daily 60 % energy restriction is not a viable strategy
for risk reduction in the general population as it is diffi-
cult to sustain. We demonstrated that intermittent en-
ergy restriction (IER), which involves strict 65 % energy
restriction for two days and normal healthy eating with a
Mediterranean diet for five days each week is achievable
and is associated with reduction in weight, body fat [10]
and insulin resistance [10, 11] amongst overweight/obese
women. IER is an increasingly popular approach for
weight loss but little is known about its systemic effects
on metabolism or on the breast itself [12]. In the study
reported here we examined the effects of IER within the
breast by gene expression analyses and assessment of
breast adipocyte size. Systemic effects were assessed by
measuring insulin, lipids and serum and urinary metabo-
lites. We also assessed the effects of IER on gene expres-
sion in lymphocytes to determine whether this could be
used as an accessible surrogate of changes in breast gene
expression. The gene expression and metabolomics find-
ings with IER were compared to a previous study of daily
60 % CER for one menstrual cycle at our centre [9].
In this study, IER for two days per week resulted in
marked weight loss over four to five weeks and in multiple
systemic metabolic alterations which changed most at the
end of the two restricted days and predominately returned
towards baseline at the end of the five unrestricted days of
IER. Gene expression analysis of breast tissue identified
two distinct groups of participants; 11 out of 20 women
displayed changes involving downregulation of epithelial
mRNAs associated with aspects of breast metabolism,
whereas the remaining 9 women did not have these
consistent changes. Gene expression changes in breast
tissue did not correlate with those in lymphocytes.
Changes in breast gene expression with four to five
weeks of IER (two days of 65 % energy restriction per
week, which achieved an overall 45 % energy restric-
tion) appeared to vary between women and were not as
consistent as changes observed previously after daily
60 % CER for one menstrual cycle [9].
Methods
Subjects
Twenty-four premenopausal overweight or obese women
(body mass index (BMI) 24–34 kg/m2 and body fat per-
centage 30–42 %), aged 35–45 years, and at increased
risk of breast cancer (greater than one in six lifetime
risk) were recruited from the Genesis Family History
Clinic at the University Hospital of South Manchester,
UK. In addition to the above, entry criteria included a nor-
mal mammogram within 12 months, estimated visual
assessed breast density ≥30 % to ensure epithelium
was obtained in the core biopsy, stable or increasing
weight, and sedentary lifestyle (participating in ≤40 mi-
nutes of moderate activity per week) and regular men-
strual cycles. Exclusion criteria included; restrictive, or
high phytoestrogen-supplemented diets, previous use of
tamoxifen, regular use of anti-inflammatory, anticoagu-
lant, anti-platelet or oral contraceptive medication, preg-
nancy or planning a pregnancy, hysterectomy, co-morbid
conditions such as a previous diagnosis of cancer, diabetes,
ischaemic vascular disease, thyroid disease or psychiatric
disorders that would limit adherence to the dietary
programme and factors that may affect lymphocyte func-
tion, i.e. underlying autoimmune, inflammatory or allergy
conditions, inoculations or blood donation within the past
two months.
The study was reviewed by the North West 10 Research
Ethics Committee, Greater Manchester North (09/H1006/
33). All participants provided written informed consent
prior to participation. The trial registration number is
ISRCTN77916487 (www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN77916487).
Intermittent energy restriction for one menstrual cycle
The IER intervention was designed to produce an overall
25 % energy restriction below estimated requirements
(calculated from estimated resting energy expenditure
multiplied by a physical activity level of 1.4) [13, 14] and
ranged from 5984 to 7560 kJ/day for the participants.
The IER included two consecutive days of 65 % energy
restriction (approximately 2700 kJ, 100 g carbohydrate
and 50 g of protein per day) and a Mediterranean-type
diet that met subjects’ estimated energy requirements
for the remaining five days of the week (range 7300–
Harvie et al. Breast Cancer Research  (2016) 18:57 
Page 2 of 14
 9500 kJ/day). Each energy-restricted day included four
80-g portions of vegetables and one 80-g portion of fruit,
and six portions of low-fat dairy produce, e.g. 2 pints of
semi-skimmed milk or equivalent low-fat yoghurt or cot-
tage cheese. On the five subsequent days the women were
asked to consume a Mediterranean style diet, which pro-
vided 45 % of energy from low-glycaemi-index carbohy-
drates, 30 % from fat (15 % monounsaturated fat, 7 % from
saturated fat, 8 % from polyunsaturated fat) and 25 % en-
ergy from protein as described previously [10, 11]. Women
commenced the diet within two days of their baseline as-
sessment and followed the diet for one menstrual cycle
(four to five weeks). Timing of trial assessments was stan-
dardised to one phase of the menstrual cycle. Of the 24
women who entered the study, 23 completed the energy re-
striction for one menstrual cycle. Nineteen of these started
and finished in the follicular phase of their cycle, and four
started and finished in the early luteal phase. Diets were
not provided to participants but were self-selected, guided
by detailed individualised food portion lists, meal plans and
recipes. Participants were asked to keep daily food diaries
throughout the study period and were monitored weekly by
the study dietitians to maximize compliance. Participants
were asked to maintain their sedentary lifestyle.
Trial assessments
Weight and anthropometric measurements, breast bi-
opsy (breast gene expression, breast adipocyte size),
blood and urine samples (serum hormones, lipids and
serum and urine metabolic markers) were conducted
after an overnight fast at baseline before starting the diet
(time point 1 (TP1)) and after four to five weeks of the
diet on the morning immediately after the two day 65 %
dietary restriction (time point 2 (TP2)). Weight, anthropo-
metrics, blood and urine samples were also repeated at
the end of the final week after five further unrestricted
days (time point 3 (TP3)) (Fig. 1).
Body measurements
Body weight and total body fat, percentage body fat, fat free
mass (FFM) (bioelectrical impedance, Tanita, UK TBF180)
and waist, hip and bust measurements were assessed using
standard methods [11]. Dietary adherence was assessed
throughout the four to five week study period with weekly
food diaries. Physical activity was assessed using the Inter-
national Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [15] to
confirm participants had remained sedentary throughout
the study.
Serum assays and metabolomics
Fasting insulin, glucose, low-dendity lipoprotein (LDL),
high-density lipoprotein (HD)L, cholesterol and triglycer-
ides were analysed in the Biochemistry Department at the
University Hospital of South Manchester as described
previously [10]. Fasting insulin and glucose were com-
bined to calculate the insulin sensitivity index using the
homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) [16]. Serum and
plasma samples were aliquoted, stored at −80 °C, and
batched so that all samples from a participant were in-
cluded in the same assay. Serum estradiol and progesterone
were assessed using electro-chemiluminescence (Abbott
diagnostics, Abbott Ireland). Serum and urine samples
were collected for metabolomics analysis using standard
methods and respectively analysed at the Manchester
Institute of Biotechnology, University of Manchester
using four modes [17, 18]; liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry (LCMS)-positive mode (LCMS+), LCMS-
negative mode (LCMS–), gas chromatography mass spec-
trometry (GCMS) serum and GCMS urine.
Breast biopsy procedure
Breast biopsies within dense areas of the breast were
performed under radiographic guidance with the breast
Fig. 1 Degree of dietary energy restriction during four to five weeks
of intermittent energy restriction (IER) and continuous energy
restriction (CER). The IER cohort undertook 65 % energy restriction (ER)
on two consecutive days per week and additionally restricted their
energy intake to an average of 38 % below their baseline intake on the
remaining five days of the week, which was unplanned (blue solid line).
The planned and unplanned energy restriction resulted in an
overall 45 % energy restriction over the one-month trial period
(blue dashed line). For comparison our previous study of CER
involved a 60 % daily energy restriction over a one-month period.

 immobilised under the compression device. After infil-
tration of 2 % lidocaine, a small incision was made in
the skin at the biopsy site, through which a 14-gauge
biopsy needle was inserted to a depth estimated by
the operator. Between seven and nine biopsy samples
were obtained through the same skin incision and the
direction of the needle was similar for each sample. The
TP1 biopsies were taken from either the left or right breast
side, which was chosen independently by computer ran-
domisatio,n and the final TP2 biopsies were taken from the
opposite side to eliminate potential gene expression
changes related to the healing process. One half of two
separate breast cores was fixed in 4 % formalin and embed-
ded in paraffin blocks, and the remaining tissue was imme-
diately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.
Collection and analysis of lymphocytes
Blood samples from EDTA tubes were layered on top of
Lymphoprep (Axis Shield Ltd, UK) and spun at 800 g
for 20 minutes at 4 °C. Lymphocytes were then removed
from the middle of the tube and spun once more at 1000 g
for 10 minutes. RNA was extracted from the pelleted lym-
phocytes using Qiashredder columns and the RNAeasy
Plus kit (Qiagen Ltd, UK) according to manufacturer’s in-
structions [19].
Gene expression analysis
RNA was extracted from the breast samples with Qiazol
by grinding breast tissue to a fine powder under liquid
nitrogen and then chloroform and RNeasy columns
(Qiagen Ltd, UK) as described previously [9]. Amplifica-
tion of total RNA from breast tissue and lymphocyte
samples was performed using the Nugen WT-Ovation™
Pico System RNA amplification kit (Nugen Technolo-
gies, Inc, Netherlands), labelled and hybridized to Affy-
metrix U133 plus2 GeneChips using manufacturers’
protocols. Gene expression data were analysed using
packages within Bioconductor [20] implemented in the
R statistical programming language. The gene expression
data were summarised from CEL files using the original
Affymetrix annotation or Ensembl gene identifiers using
an alternative Chip Definition File (aCDF) [21] and nor-
malised using Robust Multi-array Average algorithm
[22] within the ‘affy’ package. Paired and unpaired rank
products analysis [23] or significance analysis of micro-
arrays (SAM) [24] methods using the siggenes package
were used to identify differentially expressed genes with
a 5 % false discovery rate (FDR). Cross-validation and
the misclassification rate were assessed using prediction
analysis of microarrays (PAM), implemented using the
pamr package [25]. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathways and Gene Ontology terms
associated with the gene lists generated were explored
using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) bioinformatics tool [26].
All raw and processed gene expression files are avail-
able from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
[GSE66161 and GSE66159].
Assessment of breast biopsy composition
Breast biopsy composition
was
assessed to
inform
whether pre and post intervention samples had comparable
composition to allow a comparison of gene expression.
Three-micrometre sections were cut from the formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded breast biopsy cores, and stained
with haematoxylin and eosin using a standard protocol.
The proportions of fat, stroma and epithelium in each sam-
ple were estimated using Definiens Image Miner version
2.1.1 (Definiens AG, Germany) and refined using a training
set of 12 images. A minimum tissue size of 40,000 μm2 was
applied in order to eliminate artefacts from the analysis.
Areas of tissue below this threshold were ignored. We also
assessed breast biopsy composition in samples from the
previous CER study [9] for comparison.
Assessment of adipocyte size
Adipocyte sizing was assessed using >400 cells per sam-
ple using the Definiens Tissue Studio portal (Definiens
AG, Germany), using three non-serial sections from
each woman, with eight fields of view per slide. This was
undertaken in breast samples in the IER study and from
both breast and subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes
from the previous CER study [27].
Statistics
The required sample size was estimated using assump-
tions from our previous study of CER [9]. It was calculated
that 20 subjects would provide 80 % power to detect a
five-fold reduction in mRNA for lipogenesis enzymes
between baseline (TP1) and after four to five weeks of
dieting on the morning immediately after the two-day
restriction (TP2). We aimed to recruit 25 participants to
allow for problems with dietary compliance, insufficient
tissue collected at biopsy and poor-quality RNA.
Data at the three time points are presented as mean
(SD) or geometric mean (range) for log-transformed vari-
ables (insulin, insulin resistance and tryglyceride), or me-
dian (95 % CI) for non-parametric variables (oestradiol
and progesterone). We assessed changes between TP1
(baseline) and TP2 (immediately after the two restricted
days), TP1 and TP3 (at the end of the final week after five
further unrestricted days) and between TP2 and TP3
using the the paired t test for parametric variables and the
Wilcoxon signed rank test for non-parametric variables.
Statistical significance was accepted at p = 0.05.
Changes in metabolic profiles were assessed by both
multivariate and univariate methods. Multivariate analysis
was conducted to determine the degree of separation
Harvie et al. Breast Cancer Research  (2016) 18:57

 between metabolic profiles at the three time points by in-
tegrating all four metabolomic datasets, i.e. LCMS+
LCMS–, GCMS serum and GCMS urine. This was per-
formed using multi-block multi-level partial least squares
for discriminant analysis (MB-ML-PLS-DA). The MB-
ML-PLS-DA model was validated by using a bootstrap-
ping procedure as described previously [28–30].
Univariate analysis was conducted to identify specific
changes in metabolites at the three time points in two
steps. First, the Friedman test [31] was applied to each
metabolomics dataset to detect which metabolite(s) had
significantly changed between any two time points mon-
itored. Metabolites with a p value <0.05 and with an
FDR of q < 0. 1 for GCMS serum and urine were identi-
fied as statistically significant; a more conservative FDR
was applied for LCMS+ (q < 0.01) and LCMS– (q < 0.05)
to limit the number of significant features in these much
larger datasets [32]. These significant metabolites were
subsequently tested using the Tukey-Kramer test between
two specific time points [33]. Metabolomics data were
analysed using MATLAB 2012a (Mathworks, MA, USA),
and other data using SPSS version 15 (SPSS Inc., US).
Results
Characteristics of the subjects
Eight hundred and thirty-three women under surveil-
lance at the Manchester Family History Clinic received a
mailed invitation to join the study. Of these, 548 did not
respond and of those who did, 148 were not eligible and
113 declined. Twenty-four women agreed to take part in
the study. Twenty-three completed the study and had
changes in metabolomics and biochemistry assessed.
The mean age of entry for completers was 40.3 (3.2)
years, mean BMI was 28.1 (3.1) kg/m2, and mean adult
weight gain since the age of 20 years was 15.0 (7.0) kg. All
women had a lifetime risk of breast cancer ≥17 % [34] and
were mainly Caucasian (96 %) and parous (78 %). Suffi-
cient quality and quantity of RNA for gene expression
profiling was only available for both pre- and post-
intervention samples from 20 women. The 20 women in
the breast gene expression analysis were not significantly
different to the 23 in the whole cohort (age 40.6 (3) years,
BMI 28.3 (3.1) kg/m2 and adult weight gain since the age
of 20 years 15.2 (8.0) kg, p > 0.05).
Intermittent energy restriction
Women followed the IER diet for one menstrual cycle
(median 29 days) with good compliance. Twelve women
had completed eight restricted days (four weeks of IER)
and eleven completed ten restricted days (five weeks of
IER). The degree of energy restriction during the two-
day periods averaged 65 % (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1:
Table S1). Subjects were asked to eat a standard Medi-
terranean diet at their normal energy intake during the
remaining five days of the week. However, as reported in
our previous studies, there was a ‘carry-over effect’ where
women naturally restricted to an average of 38 % below
their baseline intake on these five days. Overall energy re-
striction during the trial period was therefore 45 % and
not the 25 % women were advised to undertake.
There were significant reductions in weight and body
fat with the four to five weeks of IER when assessed at
TP2 immediately after the restricted days, and five days
later after the unrestricted days (TP3) (all p < 0.001)
(Table 1). The apparent decrease in fat and increase in
weight and FFM between TP2 and TP3 most likely re-
flects an increase in glycogen stores and body water
which will increase the impedance-derived FFM meas-
urement. Reductions in waist, hip and bust were com-
parable indicating loss from several fat depots (Table 1).
There was no change in activity levels during the study
period. Reported median (95 % CI) moderate activity
with the IPAQ questionnaire was 140 (108–226) minutes
per week at baseline TP1 and 90 (79–207) minutes at
TP2 (p = 0.096, paired Wilcoxon test).
Changes in indicators of systemic metabolism assessed in
restricted and unrestricted phases of IER
Hormones and lipids
As expected, the most marked reductions in insulin, in-
sulin resistance (HOMA) and all measured lipids oc-
curred between baseline (TP1) and immediately after the
final two day restriction (TP2) (Fig. 1). There were sig-
nificant increases in levels of insulin and HOMA and re-
ductions in LDL cholesterol between TP2 and TP3, i.e.
between values immediately after the two restricted days
and five days later after five unrestricted days of the diet
(all p < 0.05). However, HOMA and all lipids remained
significantly reduced from TP1 at TP3, i.e. after four to
five weeks of the diet when measured after the unre-
stricted phase of IER (all p < 0.05) (Table 1). For women
sampled in the follicular phase (n = 19), baseline (TP1)
assessments were on average on day 8 of the menstrual
cycle and TP2 assessments on day 11. For women sam-
pled in the follicular phase (n = 19), baseline (TP1) assess-
ments were on average on day 15 of the menstrual cycle
and TP2 assessments on day 17. Both measurements were
either consistently in the follicular phase or consistently in
the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Differences in day
of cycle at TP1 and TP2 were associated with modest
increases in serum oestradiol and progesterone between
the TP1 and TP2 (respective Wilcoxon signed rank test
(p = 0.016 and p = 0.006)). The median (interquartile
range) for oestradiol in women sampled in the follicular
phase (n = 19) at TP1 was 482 (187–798) pMol/L and at
TP2 it was 637 (474–1181) pMol/L, and for women sam-
pled in the luteal phase (n = 4) at TP1 it was 310 (254–610)
pMol/L and at TP2 it was 312 (151–491) pMol/L. The
Harvie et al. Breast Cancer Research  (2016) 18:57 
Page 5 of 14
 median (interquartile range) for progesterone in women
sampled in the follicular phase (n = 19) at TP1 was 0.9
(0.9–1.0) nmol/L and 1.5 (1.0–3.3) nmol/L at TP 2, and for
women sampled in the luteal phase (n = 4) at TP1 it was
3.6 (0.9–13.3) nmol/L and at TP2 it was 12 (1–27) nmol/L.
Changes in the serum and urine metabolites
Unique metabolic features/species were detected in
the LCMS+ (n = 8100), LCMS– (n = 2208), GCMS urine
(n = 190) and GCMS serum samples (n = 102). The MB-
ML-PLS-DA model was able to integrate all four datasets
and separate the combined metabolic profiles between
TP1, TP2 and TP3. The average overall predictive accur-
acy was 93.0 %. The average misclassification rate between
TP1 and TP2 was 0.3 %, between TP1 and TP3 it was
5.1 % and between TP2 and TP3 IT was 4.7 %. Of the total
10,600 metabolites detected by LCMS and GCMS, 1324
(12.9 %) significantly changed between one or other of the
three time points (TP1 to TP2, TP1 to TP3 and TP2
to TP3) with a p value from the Friedman test <0.05
and below the assigned FDR for that dataset (q < 0.1
to q <0.01). Of the 1324 significant changes, 620 (53 %)
had an ID. The number of identified metabolites that sig-
nificantly changed between each of the time periods is
shown in Fig. 2. The greatest change was between TP1
and TP2 immediately after the two days of 65 % energy re-
striction, where 196 metabolites significantly increased
and 331 significantly decreased. The majority of these me-
tabolites (478/527; 91 %) returned to baseline at TP3 after
five days of normal eating, and thus, we assume that these
are related to the acute effects of two days of 65 % energy
restriction and not the cumulative effect of four to five
weeks of IER. The remaining 49 metabolites (11 %) did
not return to baseline between TP2 and TP3. Small
numbers of metabolites increased (n = 59) or decreased
(n = 39) between TP2 and TP3 when subjects were follow-
ing a moderately energy-restricted Mediterranean diet
(–38 % energy restriction).
Key changes in identifiable metabolites between TP1,
TP2 and TP3 from univariate analysis of LCMS+ and
GCMS serum and urine are summarised in Tables 2 and
3. The main acute changes between TP1 and TP2 at the
end of the two-day restriction were an increase in the
ketone 3-hydroxybutyric acid (GCMS urine) and acylcar-
nitines (LCMS+), reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
metabolites succinic and aconitic acid (GCMS serum) re-
duced ubiquinol (LCMS+) and reductions in the amino
acids alanine, glutamic acid, tyrosine (and associated me-
tabolite tyramine) and increases in beta-aminoisobutyric
acid (GCMS urine). This indicates increased fat oxidation,
and reduced glycolysis, TCA activity, and mitochondrial
electron chain flux after the two days of 65 % energy re-
striction. For each lipid class some metabolites increased
and some decreased between TP1 and TP2. The main
long-term effects of the diet between TP1 and TP3
were increased glycerolipids and unclassified lipids
(LCMS+) and reductions in the amino acids glutamic acid,
tyrosine (and associated metabolites tyramine and 3-p-
hydroxyphenyllactic acid) (GCMS serum). Serum LCMS–
data backed up the findings with LCMS+ but added little
new information. The fold changes in metabolites were
relatively modest. However, there was more than four-fold

Effect of IER on breast and lymphocyte gene expression
The area of fat, stroma and epithelium in biopsy pairs
was not significantly different between TP1 (35 % fat,
55 % stroma and 10 % epithelium) and TP2 (40 % fat,
52 % stroma and 8 % epithelium) samples (p = 0.30,
Mann-Whitney test). It was not possible to identify any
significantly differentially expressed genes between the
breast biopsies taken before and after IER in a pairwise
manner using pairwise SAM as found in our previous study
[9]. A possible explanation for the lack of consistency be-
tween participants was that changes in expression were
highly variable between participants. To examine this fur-
ther, we performed unsupervised hierarchical cluster ana-
lysis of the 100 genes with the highest variance of change in
expression across the 20 participants (Fig. 2) and identified
two groups of participants: a group with breast tissue which
appears to respond to IER (green) (n = 11) with expected
downregulation of metabolic genes associated with energy
restriction, i.e. reduced lipid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis
and glycogen synthesis, and a group with breast tissue that
does not appear to respond (grey) (n = 9). Some of the
responders also had increased expression of genes associ-
ated with breast epithelial cell differentiation (milk proteins,
secretoglobulins and mucins). Other transcripts with highly
variable changes in expression in the breast tissue after IER
included leptin, adiponectin, chemokines, epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and ACVR1C receptors, heat shock protein
and reduced collagen synthesis and breakdown (Fig. 3a).
These changes appeared to be breast-specific and were not
seen in the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood
lymphocytes taken at the same intervals (Fig. 3b).
If lymphocytes are to be used as a reliable surrogate for
breast tissue gene expression, there should be much stron-
ger correlation between the samples from the same individ-
ual than between non-paired samples. However, changes
between matched breast and lymphocyte samples from the
same participants were not more strongly significantly cor-
related more strongly compared to un-matched samples.
Pairwise analysis of changes in expression of the lympho-
cytes did not identify any genes that were consistently sig-
nificant using the siggenes package with a 5 % FDR.
Comparisons between responders and non-responders
We undertook diagnostic analyses to assess whether the
apparent differences in breast gene expression in response to
IER could be an artefact linked to different composition of the
breast biopsies, i.e. the proportion of fat, stroma and epithe-
lium or differences in the day of cycle or serum oestradiol and
progesterone levels between the pre and post intervention
biopsies. We also assessed whether differences were linked to
baseline characteristics, breast density (measured visually and
volumetrically) and change in weight, insulin, lipids, breast
adipocyte size, or the metabolome in serum or urine in the
different groups. There were no significant differences in any
of these parameters (Additional file 1: Table S3). There were
no differences in the metabolome between responders and
non-responders on MB-ML-PLS-DA multivariate analyses.
Univariate analyses were inconclusive and only identified
differences in 20 serum (LCMS+) and three urine (GCMS)
metabolites, which respectively represent 0.3 % and 1.6 % of
the unique serum and urine metabolites (data not shown).
These data suggest that the difference in responsive-
ness of breast tissue is not explained by methodological
issues. Differences between women appear to be breast-
specific and not obviously related to the phenotype of
the women or systemic changes in weight or hormones
(e.g. insulin) or other potential metabolic mediators
found in the serum or urine metabolome.
Comparison of the effects of IER (two days 65 % energy
restriction per week) to the effects of 60 % CER for one
menstrual cycle on breast gene expression, adipocyte size
and metabolomic changes
Reductions in total body fat with IER were less than
those previously seen with CER: –7.96 (SD 5.04) vs. –
Fig. 2 Significantly changed identified metabolites between baseline
(time point 1 (TP1)) and during the fourth or fifth cycle of intermittent
energy restriction (IER), after two days of 65 % energy restriction (TP2)
and after 5 days of normal eating (TP3). Many metabolites were not
significantly different from baseline at TP3 although some remained
elevated. Some metabolites only increased or decreased during the
five-day normal diet period between TP2 and TP3

 11.23 (SD 3.78) %, which is consistent with the lesser
overall energy restriction of 45 % with IER vs. 60 % with
CER (Additional file 1: Table S4). Reductions in insulin,
lipids and metabolite levels detected during the IER, i.e.
reduced amino acids and increases in tricarboxylic acid
metabolites and ketone bodies, were consistent with
those previously seen with CER (3614 kJ, 58 g protein
and 97 g carbohydrate per day) [9].
Changes in energy-restriction-associated gene expres-
sion in the 11 responding IER subjects were comparable
to those observed across all the participants in the previ-
ous 60 % CER study with 9/10 of the CER participants
clustering together. The expression profiles of non-
responders in the IER study appeared similar to the
non-dieting controls in the earlier CER study (Fig. 3a, c)
and was confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis (ad-
justed p = 0.027). None of the changes in breast gene ex-
pression with CER were seen in lymphocytes in the IER
study (Additional file 2: Figure S1). In the previous CER
study, 71 probe sets (representing 65 genes) were signifi-
cantly changed in the breast tissue of 10 participants
after four to five weeks of 60 % CER. Using this gene set
as a molecular classifier and applying it to predict the
status of the IER cases using the PAM method [25]

 resulted in a similar dichotomy to the unsupervised
analysis shown in Fig. 3, with 8 out of 20 partici-
pants predicted to have undergone energy restriction
(Additional file 2: Figure S1). Overall we found that IER
induces more subtle and variable changes on breast gene
expression than CER.
The response of changes
in
stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and aldolase C, fructose-
bisphosphate (ALDOC) in breast tissue across the two
studies are reported in Fig. 4. Notably the variable re-
sponse of these metabolic genes with IER is not related to
changes in body fat or weight; we could speculate that this
may be due to genetic differences between participants,
but do not have any direct evidence.
The previous CER study included abdominal sub-
cutaneous fat and breast biopsies. Very few of the 100
most variable gene changes in the breast with CER
were also highly variable across abdominal fat, suggesting
breast specificity (Fig. 3d). In the CER study, baseline
subcutaneous abdominal fat adipocytes were significantly
larger than breast adipocytes (4066 μm2 vs. 3194 μm2
p < 0.0001). There was a highly significant decrease in
subcutaneous abdominal adipocyte size with four to five
weeks of 60 % CER of 4066 μm2 to 3593 μm2 (–11 %;
p < 0.0001), which occurred in association with an
11 % reduction in total body fat. In contrast there was
a small numerical reduction in mean breast adipocyte
size in response to CER, which was not statistically signifi-
cant (3194 μm2 to 2989 μm2 –6.4 %, p > 0.121). There was
a small, statistically significant reduction in mean breast
adipocyte size from 2221 μm2 to 2087 μm2 (–6.0 %,
p < 0.01) post IER alongside a 7 % reduction in body
fat (p < 0.01).
The baseline breast adipocyte size was smaller in the IER
compared to the CER samples (2221 μm2 vs. 3194 μm2,
p < 0.0001), which may be linked to the lower body fat
levels in the IER group (36.7 ± 3.9 % vs. 44.0 ± 2.3 % body
fat (Additional file 1: Table S4)) or the larger amount of
stroma in the IER samples [35]. A linear regression of the
combined IER and CER datasets including both these fac-
tors explained 38 % of the variation in fat cell size. The
trial in which the subject was participating was a signifi-
cant predictor in this model (p = 0.035) whereas percent-
age body fat was not (p = 0.455). There were no significant
differences in changes in fat cell size between responders
and non-responders to IER (Additional file 1: Table S3).
Discussion
This is the first study to examine the effects of IER on
the breast and systematic metabolism. All women had
marked changes in weight, adiposity, systemic hor-
mones, lipids and metabolites. However, only half of the
women had breast gene expression changes associated
with decreased anabolism, i.e. decreased fatty acid bio-
synthesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogen syn-
thesis. The inconsistent breast tissue gene expression
changes with IER did not correlate with compliance, or
the changes in weight or systemic metabolism, thus ap-
pear to be participant-specific. This requires further
study to determine the underlying mechanism. The
changes in metabolic gene expression profiles in the 11
responders to IER resembled changes in women under-
taking a 60 % CER for one menstrual cycle from our
previous study whilst the 9 non-responders resembled
the non-dieting controls in this study [9]. However, we
acknowledge that differences in entry criteria and sample
processing between the studies may have affected these
results. Some of the women following IER also appeared
to have had increases in epithelial cell differentiation (i.e. in-
creased lactalbumin caseins, mammoglobins and mucins)
and decreases in collagen synthesis (TNMD, PCOLCE2,
TIMP4), which was less evident in women on CER and
may be specific to IER.

 We studied IER because previous short-term rando-
mised trials in women have reported greater reductions
in weight and adiposity [10, 11] and insulin [11] com-
pared with CER. Part of the reported superiority of IER
may be because of greater energy restriction than CER
[10, 11]. In the study reported here the two-day IER was
designed to produce an overall 25 % ER, but a carry-
over effect after the two-day restriction (average 38 %

 reduction) meant that intake was also reduced during
the next five days of the standard Mediterranean diet.
Thus, the participants undertook an overall 45 % energy
restriction rather than the projected 25 %. Our findings
with IER do not necessarily inform what would happen
with just two days of restriction and five days of com-
pletely normal intake on the other days of the week.
This pragmatic study is instead reporting the breast and
systemic effects of a two-day IER regimen, with the mag-
nitude of restriction that we have found occurs with this
pattern of eating [10, 11].
IER induced large fluctuations in insulin, with the
greatest reductions seen after the two 65 % energy re-
striction days (–30 % from baseline) and lesser reduc-
tions on unrestricted days (–10 % from baseline) as
shown previously [10, 11]. Likewise, IER induced large
changes in metabolites after the two restricted days,
which reflects a switch to fat oxidation and reduced gly-
colysis and TCA activity. The two-day restriction was
also associated with increased urine levels of beta-
aminoisobutyric acid and increased TCA metabolites,
which have both been linked to improved mitochondrial
function and insulin sensitivity and reduced risk of dia-
betes, obesity and cardiovascular disease [36–38].
Interestingly the potentially beneficial changes in metab-
olism reported in the restricted days of IER were not seen
after the five days of the moderately energy-restricted
(38 %) Mediterranean diet with IER. A 38 % energy re-
striction is at the limits of what can be achieved with
standard continuous energy-restricted diets (typically 25–
40 %). Thus, this raises the possibility that standard daily
dieting may not elicit shifts in metabolism and increased
fat oxidation, which can only be achieved during spells of
a more severe restriction (≥65 %) with IER.
Whether such profound cyclical changes in the serum
metabolites between restricted and non-restricted days
are beneficial or harmful to health is not known, The
ability to switch from fat oxidation in an energy-
deficient state and carbohydrate metabolism in a post-
prandial state is considered important for metabolic
health and to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases
such as cancer and cardiovascular disease [39]. IER also
led to sustained reductions in the amino acids glutamic
acid and tyrosine during the restricted and the normal
healthy eating days. These reductions may indicate im-
proved insulin sensitivity and reduced muscle proteolysis
or increased oxidative metabolism of amino acids [40].
IER was originally introduced in rodent experiments
to make overall energy restriction easier to administer
[41]. Subsequent rodent studies indicate IER is equivalent
or superior to CER in terms of weight loss, improving in-
sulin sensitivity, preventing tumours, increasing resistance
to neuronal damage, reducing cognitive impairment, pro-
tecting the heart and increasing the lifespan of rodents [5].
However, the safety of IER in the long term is not estab-
lished, even in rodents. The metabolomics data link IER
to marked acute increases in ketones and some fatty acids.
There are potential concerns that a rise in circulating fatty
acids could promote tumour growth [42]. Ketones have
been related to both reduction and increases in tumour
cell proliferation and growth [43, 44]. The ketone sodium
Fig. 4 Changes in weight and body fat are correlated with
transcriptional markers of energy restriction in breast tissue, but only
half of the participants on intermittent energy restriction (IER) have
expected molecular changes. Examples demonstrating that IER induces
more subtle and variable changes than continuous energy restriction
(CER) in breast tissue, both in terms of fat and weight percentage
changes and changes in transcription of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)
(fat synthesis) and aldolase C, fructose-bisphosphate (ALDOC) (glycolysis).

 butyrate has been linked to increased breast cell differenti-
ation as assessed morphologically and by lactalbumin pro-
duction [45, 46], which may have a role in the increased
expression of differentiation genes we reported in some of
the patients on IER.
Gene expression changes in lymphocytes were not
consistent with changes in the breast, and so are not
likely to be a useful biomarker of changes in the breast
with energy restriction. In contrast, previous dietary
intervention studies have found that lymphocytes can re-
flect liver and adipose transcriptomics and are useful for
studying genes related to fatty acid and cholesterol me-
tabolism and inflammation [47].
This is the first study to report changes in breast adi-
pocyte cell size with energy restriction and weight loss
in humans. Breast adipocytes were smaller than abdom-
inal adipocytes amongst the obese subjects studied in
our previous CER trial. This contrasts to previous re-
ports of comparable fat cell size and lipolytic responses
between breast and subcutaneous abdominal fat cells
amongst normal and overweight subjects [48]. The CER
group experienced significant reductions in abdominal
fat size (–11 %) with weight loss as previously docu-
mented [49, 50]. Reduced fat cell size is believed to me-
diate improved insulin sensitivity rather than reductions
in fat cell numbers [51], and is likely to account for the
reduced abdominal fat mass. Reductions in breast fat in-
dicated by reduced bust measurements with CER did
not occur alongside significant reductions in breast adi-
pocyte size suggesting that reduced fat in the breast
may result from reduced fat cell numbers, rather than
reduced fat cell size. The modest reduction in breast
adipocyte size with IER (6 %) alongside a 7 % reduction
in total body fat is likely to reflect acute lipolysis on the
preceding two energy-restricted days. The failure of
CER and IER to significantly impact on breast adipocyte
size in the premenopausal at-risk breast is intriguing.
Large breast adipocytes have been found to be associated
with increased inflammation and aromatase expression,
mainly amongst obese postmenopausal women [52].
Further data on weight loss on breast adipocyte size
and number in premenopausal and postmenopausal
women are required.
Changes in breast and systemic metabolism seen after
four to five weeks of IER were brought about by effects
of diet-induced weight loss, reduced energy intake or
modifications of diet composition, i.e. reductions in en-
ergy, carbohydrate, fat and protein with IER. There were
no reported increases in physical activity. Pre and post
study IPAQ physical activity scores both reflect relatively
high levels of activity but are assumed to be overestimates,
which is well-known with physical activity questionnaires
[53]. Future trials should assess physical activity using dir-
ect assessment methods such as accelerometry.
The strength of this study is the good compliance with
the IER with completion of restricted days immediately
prior to post-diet assessments in all subjects and near
complete assessment of study endpoints amongst our
cohort. Weaknesses include the relatively small numbers
of subjects and lack of a direct randomised comparison
to a non-diet or CER group. Some of our conclusions
depend on case study comparisons between the current
IER and a previous CER study. Women in both the IER
and CER cohorts had regular cycles, were premeno-
pausal, and at increased risk of breast cancer, but there
were key differences between the groups. Women in the
CER study had a greater starting weight than the IER
cohort (mean (SD) BMI 33.9 (3) kg/m2 vs. 28.1 (3.1) kg/m2,
p < 0.001 independent samples t test). In addition, CER
breast biopsies were not targeted to stroma and thus,
had a higher fat content compared with the IER biop-
sies; CER (87 % fat, 10 % stroma and 3 % epithelium)
vs. IER (35 % fat, 55 % stroma and 10 % epithelium)
(p < 0.001 Mann-Whitney test).
We aimed to standardise biopsy and metabolic mea-
surements in the first week of the menstrual cycle to
avoid confounding hormonal effects. This proved diffi-
cult within our cohort due to clinical logistics. On aver-
age women were reassessed three to four days later in
their cycle than baseline assessments, but remained in
either the follicular or luteal phase and this did not ex-
plain the gene expression responder and non-responder
groups identified.
Conclusions
In conclusion we have demonstrated that IER is associ-
ated with marked weight loss and reductions of insulin
and lipids. A large number of serum and urine metabo-
lites fluctuate in the restricted and unrestricted phases
of the diet. IER by a 65 % energy restriction on days per
week (overall 45 % energy restriction) had a variable ef-
fect on breast gene expression. Only half of the partici-
pants had gene expression evidence characteristic of
anabolism (downregulation of lipogenesis and glycoly-
sis), whereas a more consistent response was observed
with a continuous 60 % energy restriction. Further inves-
tigations of the effects of an intermittent energy restric-
tion (two days/week of 65 % energy restriction) and
identifying women who may respond to this pattern and
level of energy restriction are warranted, as this repre-
sents an effective and potentially feasible method of en-
ergy restriction.

the new name. AHS is very grateful for funding from Breast Cancer Now.
Biochemistry analyses were undertaken by Helen Sumner. Logistical help was
provided by Jayne Beesley, Jenny Affen and Rosemary Greenhalgh. The
radiographers were Rita Borgen, Liz Lord and Val Rees. Julie Morris and Sigrid
Whiteside helped with the study design and statistics. Matthew Collier is
thanked for undertaking statistical analysis of physical activity data.
