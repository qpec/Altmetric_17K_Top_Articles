Abstract In temperate climates, winter deaths exceed summer ones. However, there is limited
information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality, by local
climate, age group, sex and medical cause of death. We used geo-coded mortality data and
wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the
USA and its subnational climatic regions. Death rates in men and women � 45 years peaked in
December to February and were lowest in June to August, driven by cardiorespiratory diseases
and injuries. In these ages, percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months
did not vary across climate regions, nor changed from 1980 to 2016. Under five years, seasonality
of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s. In adolescents and young adults,
especially in males, death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January, driven
by injury deaths.

Introduction
It is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year, and in temperate climates there tend
to be more deaths in winter than in summer (Campbell, 2017; Fowler et al., 2015; Healy, 2003;
McKee, 1989). It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality
in temperate climates (Langford and Bentham, 1995; Martens, 1998). In a large country like the
USA, which possesses distinct climate regions, the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically,
due to geographical variations in mortality, localized weather patterns, and regional differences in
adaptation measures such as heating, air conditioning and healthcare (Davis et al., 2004;
Braga et al., 2001; Kalkstein, 2013; Medina-Ramo
´n and Schwartz, 2007). The presence and
extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time (Bobb et al., 2014;
Carson et al., 2006; Seretakis et al., 1997; Sheridan et al., 2009).
A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality, and its geo-
graphical and demographic patterns, is needed to identify at-risk groups, plan responses at the
present time as well as under changing climate conditions. Although mortality seasonality is well-
established, there is limited information on how seasonality, including the timing of minimum and
maximum mortality, varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time, espe-
cially in relation to age group, sex and medical cause of death (Rau, 2004; Rau et al., 2018).

RESEARCH ARTICLE
 In this paper, we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and
cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group, through the application of
wavelet analytical techniques, to over three decades of national mortality data. Wavelets have been
used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena (Moy et al., 2002) and infectious diseases
(Grenfell et al., 2001). We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to
understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality. In addition, we identify how the percent-
age difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over
time.
Results
Table 1 presents number of deaths by cause of death and sex. Deaths from cardiorespiratory dis-
eases make up nearly half of all deaths (48.1%), with most deaths in that group from cardiovascular
diseases. Next highest during the study period were deaths from cancers (23.2%), followed by inju-
ries (6.8%), with two thirds of those being from unintentional injuries.
All-cause mortality in males had a 12 month seasonality in all age groups, except ages 35–44
years, for whom there was periodicity at 6 months (Figure 1). In females, there was 12 month sea-
sonality in all groups except 5–14 and 25–34 years (p-values=0.21 and 0.25, respectively) (Figure 2).
While seasonality persisted throughout the entire analysis period in older ages, it largely disap-
peared after the late 1990s in children aged 0–4 years in both sexes and in women aged 15–24
years.
Deaths from all causes of death were seasonal in older adults (above 65 or 75 years depending
on cause, p-values<0.06) (Figures 1–10 and respective figure supplements), except for intentional
injuries and substance use disorders. Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases, and within it respira-
tory infections, exhibited seasonality throughout the life-course (p-values<0.06) except for males
aged 5–24 years and females aged 15–24 years (p-values>0.11). In addition to older ages, injury
deaths were seasonal from childhood through 44 years in women and through 64 years in men (p-
values<0.09). Unintentional injuries drove the seasonality of injury deaths for females, whereas both
eLife digest In the USA, more deaths happen in the winter than the summer. But when deaths
occur varies greatly by sex, age, cause of death, and possibly region. Seasonal differences in death
rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment.
Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to
minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed, or whether existing ones are effective.
Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-
scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death.
Now, Parks et al. show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths
occur. Parks et al. analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016. While overall deaths in a
year were highest in winter and lowest in summer, a greater number of young men died during
summer – mainly due to injuries – than during winter. Seasonal differences in deaths among young
children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and
young adults have become smaller. Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked
between December and February – largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases, or injuries.
Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months. Death patterns in older
people changed little over time. No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns,
despite large climate variation across the USA.
The analysis by Parks et al. suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful
in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups. But more needs to be done to address seasonal
differences in deaths among older adults. For example, by boosting flu vaccination rates, providing
warnings about severe weather and better insulation for homes. Using technology like hands-free
communication devices or home visits to help keep vulnerable elderly people connected during the
winter months may also help.

Epidemiology and Global Health
 unintentional and intentional injuries were seasonal in males in most ages, with the exception of
below 15 years and above 85 years when intentional injuries were not seasonal (Figure 7—figure
supplement 1). Consistent seasonality in cancer deaths (Figures 3,4) only appeared after 55 years
of age (p-values<0.05). No consistent seasonality was evident in substance use disorders (Figure 9—
figure supplement 1 and Figure 10—figure supplement 1) or maternal conditions (Figure 10—fig-
ure supplement 2).
Centre of gravity analysis showed that death rates in men aged �45 years and women aged �35
years peaked in December, January or February and were lowest in June to August, for all-cause
mortality as well as for all non-injury and non-maternal causes of death (Figure 11 and respective fig-
ure supplements). Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, chronic
respiratory diseases and respiratory infections, were also consistently highest in January and Febru-
ary and lowest in July and August across all ages, except for chronic respiratory diseases in ages 5–
24 years where there are few deaths from this cause leading to unstable estimates (p-values for sea-
sonality from wavelet analysis ranged from 0.35 to 0.48 for these ages). A similar temporal pattern
was seen for all-cause and non-injury mortality in children younger than five years of age, whose all-
cause death rate was highest in February and lowest in August. In contrast, among males aged 5–34
years, all-cause mortality peaked in June or July, as did deaths from injuries, which generally had a
summer peak in males and females below 45 years of age.
From 1980 to 2016, the proportional (percent) difference in all-cause death rates between peak
and minimum months declined little for people older than 45 years of age (by less than eight per-
centage points with p-values for declining trend >0.1) (Figure 12). In contrast, the difference
between peak (summer) and minimum (winter) death rates declined in younger ages, by over 25 per-
centage points in males aged 5–14 years and 15–24 years (p-values<0.01), largely driven in the
declining difference between summer and winter injury deaths. Under five years of age, percent sea-
sonal difference in all-cause death rates declined by 13 percentage points (p-value<0.01) for boys
but only five percentage points (p-value=0.12) for girls. These declines in seasonality of child deaths
were a net effect of declining winter-summer difference in cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and
increasing summer-winter difference in injury deaths, itself driven by increasing difference in non-
intentional injuries (Figure 12—figure supplement 1). Within specific cardiorespiratory diseases in
under-five children, percent difference declined for cardiorespiratory diseases, cardiovascular dis-
eases, and chronic respiratory diseases while increasing for respiratory infections.
The subnational centre of gravity analysis showed that all-cause mortality peaks and minima in dif-
ferent climate regions are consistent with the national ones (Figures 13–16), indicating that season-
ality is largely independent of geography. The relative homogeneity of the timing of maximum and
minimum mortality contrasts with the large variation in seasonal temperatures among climate
regions. For example, in men and women aged 65–74 years, all-cause mortality peaked in February
in the Northeast and Southeast, even though the average temperatures for those regions were dif-
ferent by over 13 degrees Celsius (9.3 in the Southeast compared with �3.8 in the Northeast).

 Furthermore, above 45 years of age, there was little inter-region variation in the percent seasonal
difference in all-cause mortality, despite the large variation in temperature difference between the
peak and minimum months (Figure 17).
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality
dynamically over space and time, by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of
gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of
death rates and regional temperature. A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate season-
ality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determi-
nants and planning responses.

 Discussion
We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses, which allowed systematically identifying and charac-
terizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA, and examining how seasonality
has changed over time. We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex, including
higher all-cause summer mortality in young men (Feinstein, 2002; Rau et al., 2018). Importantly, we
also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both
timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter
temperatures. Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time
or nationally, or fixed to pre-specified frequencies.
Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of
death in the USA (Feinstein, 2002; Kalkstein, 2013; Rau, 2004; Rau et al., 2018; Rose-
nwaike, 1966; Seretakis et al., 1997). Few of these studies have done consistent national and sub-
national analyses, and none has done so over time, for a comprehensive set of age groups and

 causes of death, and in relation to regional temperature differences. Our results on strong seasonal-
ity of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths, restricted to older
ages, are broadly consistent with these studies (Feinstein, 2002; Rau et al., 2018; Rose-
nwaike, 1966; Seretakis et al., 1997), which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over
time and geography (Feinstein, 2002; Rau et al., 2018; Rosenwaike, 1966). Similarly, our results
on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies (Feinstein, 2002; Rau et al.,
2018; Rosenwaike, 1966), but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in
when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time
in relation to age group which had not been reported before.
A study of 36 cities in the USA, aggregated across age groups and over time, also found that
excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range (Kinney et al., 2015). In con-
trast, a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in
colder

in

(Healy,
2003;
McKee, 1989) (the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed
from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis
although the two measures are correlated). The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality
seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature

 seasonality, whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental (e.g. housing insulation and
heating) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern
Europe. If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and
seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time, the changes in
temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality
difference.
The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in
adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of (unintentional) injuries,
especially from road traffic crashes, which are more likely to occur in the summer months (Liu et al.,
2005) and are more common in men. The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age
was related to two phenomena: first, the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases
declined, and second, the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions, which exhibit limited sea-
sonality (Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and Figure 10—figure supplement 3), increased
(MacDorman and Gregory, 2015).
In contrast to young and middle ages, mortality in older ages, where death rates are highest,
maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades (we note that although the percent
seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages, the absolute

 difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortal-
ity has a declining long-term trend). This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and
health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate.
Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical
protective factors, such as better insulation of homes, winter heating provision and flu vaccinations,
for the vulnerable older population (Katiyo et al., 2017). Social interventions, including regular visits
to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for
adverse conditions, and responsive and high-quality emergency care, are also important to protect
this vulnerable group (Healy, 2003; Lerchl, 1998; Katiyo et al., 2017). Emergent new technologies,
such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world, in-house cam-
eras, and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older, more vulnera-
ble groups in the population, especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions
(Morris, 2013). Such interventions are important today, and will remain so as the population ages
and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability.

Data
We used data on all 85,854,176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS). Age, sex, state of residence, month of death, and underlying cause of
death were available for each record. The underlying cause of death was coded according to the
international classification of diseases (ICD) system (9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th
revision of ICD thereafter). Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and
from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 (Ingram et al., 2003). We calculated monthly population
counts through linear interpolation, assigning each yearly count to July.
We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Figure 18 and Table 2) (Karl and Koss, 1984).
On average, the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual tempera-
tures of 18.4˚C and 18˚C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum
monthly temperature (27.9˚C in July). The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is
that of the Southeast (an average range of 17.5˚C). The three coldest climate regions are West North
Central, East North Central and the Northwest (7.6˚C, 8.0˚C, 8.2˚C respectively). Mirroring the char-
acteristics of the hottest climate regions, the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is

 that of the coldest region, West North Central (an average range of 30.5˚C), which also has the low-
est average minimum monthly temperature (�6.5˚C in January). The other climate regions, North-
east, Southwest, and Central, possess similar average temperatures (10˚C to 14˚C) and variation
within the year of (23˚C to 26˚C), with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United
States (with 19.8% total population in 2016).
Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4, 5–14, 15-24, 25–34, 35–
44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, 85+ years. We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex
group, both nationally and for sub-national climate regions. Death rate calculations accounted for
varying length of months, by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it
equivalent to a 31 day month.
For analysis of seasonality by cause of death, we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four
main disease categories (Table 1) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Sup-
plementary Note. Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56.4% and 21.2% of all
deaths in the USA, respectively, in 1980, and 40.3% and 22.4%, respectively, in 2016. Deaths from
cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures (Basu, 2009;
Basu and Samet, 2002; Bennett et al., 2014; Braga et al., 2002; Gasparrini et al., 2015). Injuries,

 which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7.3% in 2016, may have seasonality
that is distinct from so-called natural causes. We did not further divide other causes because the
number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group, sex
and climate region.
We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim, which combines predictions from a physical
model with ground-based and satellite measurements (Dee et al., 2011). We used gridded four-
times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted tempera-
ture by climate region throughout the analysis period.
Statistical methods
We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group. Wavelet analysis
uncovers the presence, and frequency, of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific
death rate time series (Hubbard, 1998; Torrence and Compo, 1998). In brief, a Morlet wavelet,
described in detail elsewhere (Cazelles et al., 2008), is equivalent to using a moving window on the
death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform,
hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis, which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns, in
which the periodicity of death rates may disappear, emerge, or change over time. In addition to
coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity, wavelet analysis estimates the probability of
whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented
with white (an independent random process) or red (autoregressive of order one process) noise. For
each age-sex group, we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the
comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period (1980–2016) with 100 simulations
against a white noise spectrum, which represents random fluctuations. We used the R package
WaveletComp (version 1.0) for the wavelet analysis. Before analysis, we de-trended death rates using
a polynomial regression, and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and �1.
To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates, we calculated the centre of gravity
and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates. Centre of gravity was calculated as a
weighted average of months of deaths, with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre
of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths, but with each month was
weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate. In taking the
weighted average, we allowed December (month 12) to neighbour January (month 1), representing
each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle. Using a tech-
nique called circular statistics, a mean
�
�
� �
of the angles (�1; �2; �3 . . . ; �n;) representing the deaths
(with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death) is found using
the relation below:
�
�
¼ arg
X
n
j¼1
exp i�j
�
�
(
)
;
where arg denotes the complex number argument and �j denotes the month of death in angular
form for a particular death j. The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month
value (Fisher, 1995). Along with each circular mean, a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by
using 1000 bootstrap samples. The R package CircStats (version 0.2.4) was used for this analysis.
For each age-sex group and cause of death, and for each year, we calculated the percent differ-
ence in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months. We fitted a linear regres-
sion to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016, and used the fitted trend line to
estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum
mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016. We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse
of the square of its standard error, which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population
size of each age-sex group through time into account. This method gives us a p-value for the change
in seasonal difference per year, which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start (1980)
and end (2016) of the period of study. Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assum-
ing that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a
particular cause of death, which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter
