Abstract
Introduction
Increasing tobacco excise taxes and implementing comprehensive
smoke-free laws are two of the most effective population-level
strategies to reduce tobacco use, prevent tobacco use initiation,
and protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke. We examined
state laws related to smoke-free buildings and to cigarette excise
taxes from 2000 through 2014 to see how implementation of these
laws from 2000 through 2009 differs from implementation in more
recent years (2010–2014).
Methods
We used legislative data from LexisNexis, an online legal re-
search database, to examine changes in statewide smoke-free laws
and cigarette excise taxes in effect from January 1, 2000, through
December  31,  2014.  A  comprehensive  smoke-free  law  was
defined as a statewide law prohibiting smoking in all indoor areas
of private work sites, restaurants, and bars.
Results
From 2000 through 2009, 21 states and the District of Columbia
implemented comprehensive smoke-free laws prohibiting smoking
in work sites, restaurants, and bars. In 2010, 4 states implemented
comprehensive smoke-free laws. The last state to implement a
comprehensive smoke-free law was North Dakota in 2012, bring-
ing the total number to 26 states and the District of Columbia.
From 2000 through 2009, 46 states and the District of Columbia
implemented laws increasing their cigarette excise tax, which in-
creased  the  national  average  state  excise  tax  rate  by  $0.92.
However, from 2010 through 2014, only 14 states and the District
of Columbia increased their excise tax, which increased the na-
tional average state excise tax rate by $0.20.
Conclusion
The  recent  stall  in  progress  in  enacting  and  implementing
statewide comprehensive smoke-free laws and increasing cigar-
ette excise taxes may undermine tobacco prevention and control
efforts in the United States, undercutting efforts to reduce tobacco
use, exposure to secondhand smoke, health disparities, and to-
bacco-related illness and death.
Introduction
Tobacco use causes more than 480,000 premature deaths in the
United States annually (1). Smoke-free policies and tobacco taxes
reduce tobacco use, increase tobacco use cessation, reduce initi-
ation of tobacco use, and reduce tobacco-related illness and death,
including deaths related to exposure to secondhand smoke (1,2).
Both population-level interventions contributed, in part, to the ma-
jor public health achievement of averting 8 million premature
smoking-attributable deaths from 1964 through 2014 (3).
The United States has made substantial progress in implementing
comprehensive smoke-free laws and cigarette excise taxes (1).
Since 2000, the number of states with comprehensive smoke-free
laws increased from 0 to 26 states and the District of Columbia
(4). Furthermore, cigarette prices increased significantly over the
past decade, driven in part by numerous state and local tax in-
creases and a 2009 federal tax increase (1). As of December 31,
2014, the average state cigarette excise tax rate was at an all-time
high of $1.54 per pack (5).

 Previous studies examined state-specific trends for comprehens-
ive smoke-free laws from 2000 to 2010 and laws that increase ci-
garette excise tax rates from 2010 to 2011; however, more recent
trends have not been assessed (4,6). The objective of this study
was to examine state-specific data for both types of laws (smoke-
free laws and cigarette excise tax laws) from 2000 through 2014,
to determine how implementation of these laws from 2000 through
2009  differs  from  implementation  in  more  recent  years
(2010–2014).
Methods
Data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention’s (CDC’s) State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evalu-
ation (STATE) system, which contains tobacco-related epidemi-
ologic and economic data and information on state tobacco-re-
lated legislation for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia
(7). Data are collected quarterly from LexisNexis (RELX Group),
an online legal research database, and are then analyzed, coded,
and entered into the STATE system (7).
We examined changes in comprehensive state smoke-free laws
and state cigarette excise tax laws in effect from January 1, 2000,
through December 31, 2014. A law was considered in effect in a
specific year if the law was implemented during that year (determ-
ined by the date the law took effect, rather than the date the law
was enacted). CDC defines a state smoke-free law as comprehens-
ive if it prohibits smoking in private work sites, restaurants, and
bars (1,8). To be considered comprehensive, a law must prohibit
smoking in all indoor areas in these settings with no exceptions.
Some states have laws in effect with less stringent smoking re-
strictions, such as laws establishing designated smoking areas or
permitting smoking in separately ventilated areas. Other states
have laws in effect that prohibit smoking at all times in 1 or 2 of
these settings, but not all 3; such laws were not considered com-
prehensive for this assessment, because evidence indicates that
they are not as effective as comprehensive smoke-free laws in
eliminating population-level exposure to secondhand smoke (1,8).
We examined state cigarette excise tax laws in terms of the price
per pack; we did not address increases in the tax on other tobacco
products (eg, cigars, smokeless tobacco). We used US Census
Bureau definitions to categorize states into 4 regions: Northeast,
South, Midwest, and West (9).
We assessed changes in state comprehensive smoke-free laws and
cigarette excise taxes in effect that occurred from 2000 through
2014, and also compared changes in laws from 2000 through 2009
with changes in laws from 2010 through  2014. We examined the
number of laws in effect, changes in state excise tax rates per pack
of cigarettes, and the change in the average state excise tax rate
per pack over time.
Results
In 2002, Delaware became the first state to implement a compre-
hensive smoke-free law. In the following years, several states fol-
lowed suit, especially during the latter half of the past decade
(2005 to 2009). By December 31, 2009, 21 states and the District
of Columbia had comprehensive smoke-free laws in effect (Table
1); of these 21 states, 6 had laws go into effect in 2009 (Figure 1).

By December 31, 2009, 10 states had laws in effect that prohib-
ited smoking in all indoor areas of work sites, restaurants, or bars
but did not prohibit all smoking in all 3 areas. From 2000 through
2009, 19 states made no changes to their smoking laws.
In 2010, comprehensive smoke-free laws went into effect in 4 ad-
ditional states (Kansas, Michigan, South Dakota, and Wisconsin).
No new comprehensive state smoke-free laws went into effect in
2011, and in 2012 a comprehensive smoke-free law went into ef-
fect in North Dakota. From 2012 through 2014, no state passed a
comprehensive smoke-free law (Figure 1).
As of December 31, 2014, 24 states had no comprehensive smoke-
free laws in place; 11 states had not changed their smoking laws
since before 2000 and had no laws partially or totally restricting
smoking.
As of December 31, 2014, statewide comprehensive smoke-free
laws, by US Census region, ranged from 18% of the 17 states in
the South region to 83% in the Midwest region (Table 2). From
2000 through 2009, 6 southern states (Arkansas, Delaware, Flor-

 ida, Louisiana, Maryland, and Tennessee) and the District of
Columbia had laws go into effect that created more stringent
smoking restrictions in public places (Table 1). The most strin-
gent laws were comprehensive smoke-free laws that went into ef-
fect in Delaware (2002), the District of Columbia (2007) and
Maryland (2008). Less stringent restrictions also went into effect,
prohibiting smoking in at least one location (work sites, restaur-
ants, or bars) in 4 southern states (Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana,
and Tennessee). Between 2010 and 2014, North Carolina was the
only southern state to change its statewide smoking prohibitions,
prohibiting smoking in 2 locations (restaurants and bars) in 2010.
No southern state has had a comprehensive statewide smoke-free
law go into effect since 2008.
From 2000 through 2009, the average state cigarette excise tax in-
creased by $0.92 per pack, from $0.42 in 2000 to $1.34 in 2009
(Figure 2). During this period, 46 states and the District of
Columbia increased their state excise tax rates at least once, and
102 laws went into effect that increased excise taxes (Table 1).
Only 4 states — California, Missouri, North Dakota, and South
Carolina — did not change their excise tax rate during this period.
The largest number of state cigarette excise tax increases (in 21
states) occurred in 2002. These 21 laws produced the largest annu-
al increase in the national average state excise tax rate — $0.18
(Figure 2).

cigarette excise tax rate per pack in effect, by year, 2000–2014. Source:
CDC’s State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation System.
 
From 2000 through 2009, 23 states and the District of Columbia
increased their cigarette excise tax rates by $1.00 or more (Table
1). By December 31, 2009, 19 states and the District of Columbia
had cigarette excise tax rates of $1.50 or more (Table 1). Further-
more, 2 states increased their cigarette excise taxes by over $2.00
during the same period: Connecticut implemented 4 increases
totaling $2.50, and Rhode Island implemented 5 increases totaling
$2.75.
From January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014, the national
average cigarette excise tax increased by $0.20 per pack, from
$1.34 to $1.54 (Figure 2). During this period, 14 states and the
District of Columbia increased their state excise tax rates at least
once. Changes in the average excise tax rate during this period
peaked in 2010, when 6 states raised their cigarette excise tax (Ta-
ble 1). State legislative activity in this area slowed after 2010; for
example, only 3 states implemented increases in 2014. One of
these states (Oregon) increased its excise tax by $0.13, reversing a
2004 $0.10 decrease in the excise tax per pack, thus effectively
raising the excise tax by only $0.03 per pack.
Between 2010 and 2014, only 6 states increased their excise tax
rate by $1.00 or more; 2 of those states, Minnesota and New York,
increased their excise tax rates by $1.60. Eleven states did not in-
crease their cigarette excise tax rates from 2004 to 2014. Tax rates
in 4 of these states — California, Missouri, Nevada, and North
Dakota — were unchanged since before 2000. Furthermore, no
state in the southern region increased its cigarette excise tax rate
from 2010 (when South Carolina increased its excise tax by $0.50,
to $0.57 per pack) through 2014 (Table 1). In contrast, 6 north-
eastern states increased their cigarette excise tax from 2010
through 2014 (Connecticut by $0.40 in 2011, Massachusetts by
$1.00 in 2013, New Hampshire by $0.10 in 2013 (to reverse a
$0.10 decrease in 2011), New York by $1.60 in 2010, Rhode Is-
land by $0.04 in 2012, and Vermont by $0.38 in 2011 and $0.13 in
2014) (Table 1).
Discussion
The findings from this study indicate that 2000 to 2009 was a dec-
ade of major progress in state implementation of comprehensive
smoke-free laws and cigarette excise tax increases. However, pro-
gress has slowed considerably since 2009. Only one state, (North
Dakota) had a comprehensive smoke-free law go into effect
between 2012 and 2016; on June 9, 2016, new California provi-
sions go into effect that make the state’s smoke-free law compre-
hensive.  Twenty-four  states  currently  have  minimal  or  no
statewide smoking restrictions in effect. Increases in state cigar-
ette excise taxes also slowed; between 2010 and 2014, 14 states
and the District of Columbia had excise tax increases take effect.
In contrast, 14 states and the District of Columbia had increases
take effect in 2009 alone. If progress in implementing these evid-
ence-based interventions does not resume, the United States may
not achieve its Healthy People 2020 objectives to establish smoke-
free indoor air laws in all 50 states and the District of Columbia,
and to increase cigarette excise taxes by at least $1.50 per pack in
all 50 states and the District of Columbia by the end of the current
decade (objectives TU13 and TU-17.1, respectively) (10). This

 stalled progress in both policy areas may contribute to excess, pre-
ventable tobacco-related illness and death (1).
Comprehensive smoke-free laws reduce exposure to secondhand
smoke, help smokers quit, and improve health outcomes; these
laws typically have high levels of public support and compliance
and do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality in-
dustry (eg, restaurants, bars) (1,2,8,11). However, this strong evid-
ence base has not translated into continued progress in state imple-
mentation of comprehensive smoke-free laws in recent years, al-
though such progress has continued at the local level. With a few
exceptions, state laws adopted in more recent years are more often
comprehensive laws, rather than partial laws (12). Research indic-
ates that once states pass partial smoking restrictions, they are
slow to revisit these laws and strengthen them (1,12).
The Institute of Medicine, the US Surgeon General, and the World
Health Organization all agree that increasing the price of tobacco
products is the single most effective way to reduce tobacco use
(1,13,14). Increases in the price of tobacco products, including in-
creases through state excise taxes, prevent smoking initiation, pro-
mote smoking cessation, and reduce the prevalence and intensity
of tobacco use by adolescents and adults, thereby improving
health outcomes (1,15–17). The recent slowed progress in cigar-
ette excise tax increases is significant for 3 reasons. First, state ex-
cise tax rates vary widely — from $0.17 per pack in Missouri to
$4.35 per pack in New York (1). Without sustained progress in in-
creasing state excise taxes, especially in states where such taxes
are low, low cigarette prices will contribute to smoking-related
health disparities between states. State variations in cigarette tax
rates and prices encourage tax avoidance and evasion, decreasing
state revenues and undercutting health protection by perpetuating
access to less expensive cigarettes (1). Second, excise taxes are
levied as static dollar amounts per unit; if not periodically in-
creased, these amounts do not keep pace with inflation (1). Third,
the tobacco industry often responds to tax increases with promo-
tions, such as offering coupons and discounts, to offset the projec-
ted decline in cigarette use (1,18). These 3 factors undermine the
impact of tax increases on public health, especially when those in-
creases are infrequent or small.
This study also highlights clear regional disparities. With the ex-
ception of Delaware, the District of Columbia, and Maryland, the
remaining 14 states in the southern US Census region lack com-
prehensive smoke-free protections at the state level (Table 2). As
of December 31, 2014, nine of these states either did not have any
statewide smoking restrictions or had laws requiring only desig-
nated smoking areas or separately ventilated areas in work sites,
restaurants, and bars (Table 2). Except for Delaware, the District
of Columbia, and Maryland, North Carolina is the only southern
state with a state law prohibiting smoking in restaurants and bars
(Table 2). Furthermore, the average state excise tax for southern
states is $0.96 per pack, which is considerably lower than the na-
tional average of $1.54 per pack (5). In addition to often lacking
comprehensive smoke-free laws and high excise taxes, southern
states also tend to provide low levels of funding for state tobacco
control programs and to experience smoking prevalence and
smoking-related  diseases  at  higher  rates  than  other  regions
(1,19–22). In the absence of more consistent state implementation
of evidence-based tobacco control interventions across regions,
these regional health disparities are likely to persist (1).
Despite stalled progress at the state level, progress continued in
implementing comprehensive smoke-free laws at the local level.
At least 697 localities have ordinances in place that prohibit
smoking in restaurants, work sites, and bars, and this number con-
tinued to increase during the same period when state progress in
this area stalled (23,24). Local progress in this area occurred in nu-
merous states that lack comprehensive state laws, including in sev-
eral southern states. In some southern states, such as Kentucky,
Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia, a substan-
tial portion of the state’s population lives under comprehensive
local smoke-free laws (25,26). Experience suggests that a critical
mass of comprehensive local smoke-free laws in a state may lay
the groundwork for the eventual adoption of a statewide compre-
hensive law (8,12). However, in 8 states that lack comprehensive
state smoke-free laws, local jurisdictions are preempted from en-
acting smoking restrictions that are more restrictive than state law
in some or all settings (7). Examining how local smoking restric-
tions evolved in recent years and their impact on public health
merits further research. However, statewide legislation remains the
only way to ensure that local laws do not lead to disparities in pro-
tections between localities.
The patterns observed in the local and state policy domains could
be the result of multiple factors. For example, tobacco control ef-
forts in some states may give priority to local policies over state
policies in one or both of these domains because of the greater
challenges associated with making progress at the state level and
in the hope that local progress could eventually lay the ground-
work for state progress. Another contributing factor could be the
emergence of electronic cigarettes and other electronic nicotine
delivery systems (27). The rapid spread and increasing use of
these novel products may contribute to the stall in adopting addi-
tional state smoke-free laws, because decision makers may be un-
certain whether to include these products in smoking restrictions,
or they may perceive them as complicating implementation and
enforcement of smoke-free laws (27). Another potential explana-
tion is the recent reduction in funding for state tobacco prevention
and control programs (20,28). The stall in adopting smoke-free

 laws may also be due, in part, to longstanding and continued ef-
forts by the tobacco industry to interfere with the implementation
of these efforts at the state and local levels (29).
The findings in this study are subject to at least 5 limitations. First,
the study considered only comprehensive smoke-free policies and
not less restrictive policies that provide some level of protection
from secondhand smoke. For example, California has substantial
statewide smoking restrictions that were enacted in 1994, at an
early point in the evolution of smoke-free policies, but they do not
meet current definitions of comprehensive smoke-free laws. The
state has recently updated these provisions to enact a law making
California comprehensively smoke-free, effective June 9, 2016.
Second, although progress in enacting smoke-free legislation at
the local level continued, local smoke-free ordinances were not
taken into account in this study. Third, our analysis does not in-
clude information on the price per pack of cigarettes, which varies
considerably from state to state, even between states with similar
excise tax rates, because of differences in manufacturer, whole-
saler, and retailer pricing and discounting practices. Fourth, state
excise taxes were examined for cigarettes only, excluding taxes on
other tobacco products. In general, state cigarette excise taxes tend
to be substantially higher than state taxes on other tobacco
products (7). Increasing the price of cigarettes without increasing
the price of other combustible tobacco products may lead smokers
to switch from an expensive tobacco product to a cheaper one in-
stead of quitting all tobacco use and may lead adolescents to initi-
ate tobacco use with cheaper products, such as little cigars (30).
Finally, the study did not capture administrative decisions, includ-
ing rule-making, opinions of attorneys general, or court decisions.
Recent slowdowns in implementing new statewide comprehens-
ive smoke-free laws and state excise taxes may jeopardize pro-
gress in reducing tobacco use and the health and economic bur-
dens it imposes. Although some progress was made at the local
level, the first half of the current decade (2010–2014) was marked
by a lack of momentum in both of these key policy areas at the
state level, especially when compared with the considerable pro-
gress from 2000 through 2009. This stall also highlights regional
disparities in tobacco prevention and control, particularly the lack
of progress in the South. Without accelerated progress in imple-
menting both of these important interventions, efforts to reduce to-
bacco use, exposure to secondhand smoke, health disparities, and
tobacco-related illness and death in the United States could be un-
dermined.
