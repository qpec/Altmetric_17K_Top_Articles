Abstract
Background: Management of brain metastases typically includes radiotherapy (RT) with conventional fractionation and/or stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS). However, optimal indications and practice patterns for SRS remain unclear. We sought to evaluate national practice 
patterns for patients with metastatic disease receiving brain RT. Methods: We queried the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) for patients 
diagnosed with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or melanoma from 2004 to 2014 who received up-
front brain RT. Patients were divided into SRS and non-SRS cohorts. Patient and facility-level SRS predictors were analyzed with chi-square 
tests and logistic regression, and uptake trends were approximated with linear regression. Survival by diagnosis year was analyzed with 
the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Of 75,953 patients, 12,250 (16.1%) received SRS and 63,703 (83.9%) received non-SRS. From 2004 to 
2014, the proportion of patients receiving SRS annually increased (from 9.8% to 25.6%; P<.001), and the proportion of facilities using SRS 
annually increased (from 31.2% to 50.4%; P<.001). On multivariable analysis, nonwhite race, nonprivate insurance, and residence in lower-
income or less-educated regions predicted lower SRS use (P<.05 for each). During the study period, SRS use increased disproportionally 
among patients with private insurance or who resided in higher-income or higher-educated regions. From 2004 to 2013, 1-year actuarial 
survival improved from 24.1% to 49.6% for patients selected for SRS and from 21.0% to 26.3% for non-SRS patients (P<.001). Conclusions: 
This NCDB analysis demonstrates steadily increasing—although modest overall—brain SRS use for patients with metastatic disease in the 
United States and identifies several progressively widening sociodemographic disparities in the adoption of SRS. Further research is needed 
to determine the reasons for these worsening disparities and their clinical implications on intracranial control, neurocognitive toxicities, 
quality of life, and survival for patients with brain metastases.

More than 20% of patients with cancer will develop 
brain metastases.1 Primary malignancies most com-
monly associated with brain metastases are lung, breast, 
and gastrointestinal cancers and melanoma, constitut-
ing up to 80% of brain metastases.1–3 Management of 
brain metastases often consists of tumor-directed treat-
ment with radiotherapy (RT). Traditionally, RT had 
been administered with conventionally fractionated 
whole-brain RT (WBRT), although over the past sever-
al decades, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), targeted at 
individual cranial lesions, has become accepted.4–6 Sev-
eral randomized trials demonstrated equivalent survival

with upfront SRS and WBRT for patients with 1 to 3 
brain metastases.7,8 In the context of these trials, there 
was a modest national increase in SRS use observed in 
Medicare patients with metastatic non–small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) from 2000 to 2005.9 Since then, sev-
eral randomized trials showed that SRS upfront without 
WBRT did not compromise survival and was associated 
with fewer adverse neurocognitive effects.10–12 SRS use 
may also vary by primary disease site.13,14 Additionally, 
cost concerns and access to facilities with SRS programs 
may vary and introduce disparities for certain patient 
groups.

Utilization of SRS may vary widely on a national 
scale.15,16 Therefore, we sought to evaluate recent na-
tional SRS treatment patterns, institutional adoption, 
and disparities across 4 of the malignancies most as-
sociated with brain metastases in the United States. 
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Na-
tional Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a joint project of 
the Commission on Cancer (CoC) of the American 
College of Surgeons and the American Cancer So-
ciety. It is a hospital-based database that contains 
deidentified information from approximately 70% 
of newly diagnosed cancers in the United States. 
The NCDB contains information that is unavailable 
in the SEER database, including treatment details 
pertaining to RT dose, technique, and target. Treat-
ments coded in the NCDB capture a patient’s first-
course treatment for the corresponding diagnosis. 
The data used in this study are derived from deiden-
tified NCDB participant user files. The American 
College of Surgeons and the CoC have not verified 
and are not responsible for the analytical or statis-
tical methodology used, nor the conclusions drawn 
from these data by the investigators. 
We pooled the NCDB participant user files for 
NSCLC, breast cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), 
and melanoma. We identified patients aged ≥18 
years, diagnosed with histology- or cytology-con-
firmed NSCLC, breast cancer, CRC, or melanoma 
between 2004 and 2014, with metastatic disease, 
who were treated with radiation to the brain. Pa-
tients with unknown radiation modality and dose 
were excluded. Radiation treatment modality is ex-
plicitly coded in the NCDB, and patients were divid-
ed into 2 cohorts: SRS or non-SRS. The SRS cohort 
was defined as patients who received “stereotactic ra-
diosurgery, NOS [not otherwise specified],” “LINAC 
radiosurgery,” or “gamma knife radiosurgery,” or re-
ceived external-beam RT with fraction size ≥6 Gy. 
The non-SRS cohort included all other patients re-
ceiving external-beam RT to the brain who met the 
inclusion criteria.
Statistical Methodology
Patient-level characteristics included age, year of 
diagnosis, sex, malignancy type, Charlson-Deyo 
comorbidity score (CDS), race/ethnicity, insurance 
status, distance from facility, median household 
income in patient’s zip code, residence in a metro-
politan area, and educational status in the patient’s 
zip code (percentage of adults who did not graduate 
high school). Income and educational status in the 
NCDB were derived from the 2012 American Com-
munity Survey data.17 Facility-level characteristics 
included region and academic affiliation. Data on 
the number of brain metastases are not available in 
the NCDB.
Demographic, clinical, and temporal associa-
tions were evaluated between patients in the SRS 
and non-SRS cohorts using graphical assessment, 
chi-square, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Univari-
able (UVA) multilevel, mixed-effects regression was 
performed, accounting for the reporting facility as a 
random effect, and odds ratios (ORs) were calculat-
ed. Multivariable (MVA) multilevel, mixed-effects 
logistic regression, again accounting for the report-
ing facility, was conducted using all variables with a 
significant association with SRS on UVA; adjusted 
ORs (aORs) were calculated. Variables were tested 
for collinearity and interaction. Sensitivity analysis 
with MVA logistic regression was also conducted 
after excluding patients with melanoma, given the 
predominantly white population reflected by this 
disease type.
For variables that were significant predictors of 
SRS use, analysis of temporal trends was conducted 
to assess for differential uptake across variables over 
the study period with graphical assessment. Uptake 
slopes (β) were approximated with linear regression 
and compared among categories with Wald tests.18,19 
A facility-level analysis was conducted to deter-
mine the rates of SRS adoption by US facility. For 
this analysis, only patients who received at least part 
of their first treatment course at the reporting facility 
were included. Facilities that reported at least 1 case 
of SRS during a given year were classified as an SRS 
facility for that year. Facilities that did not report a 
single case of SRS were classified as a non–SRS facil-
ity for that year.
A survival analysis was conducted after exclud-
ing patients without documented follow-up. Follow-
up was documented in our NCDB user file through 
2013. Survival was defined as time from diagnosis to 
death or last follow-up. One-year actuarial survival 
was analyzed annually during the study period using

the Kaplan-Meier method, and cohorts were com-
pared with log-rank tests.
All tests were 2-sided, and P<.05 was considered 
statistically significant. Analyses were performed us-
ing Stata/SE 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Patient Characteristics and Overall Trends  
of SRS Use
We identified 75,953 patients who met our inclu-
sion criteria for analysis (see supplemental eFigure 
1, available online with this article at JNCCN.org). 
Of these, 12,250 (16.1%) were in the SRS cohort 
and 63,703 (83.9%) were in the non-SRS cohort. 
Of 68,710 patients with NSCLC, 10,799 (15.7%) 
received SRS; of 3,565 patients with melanoma, 952 
(26.7%) received SRS; of 2,909 patients with breast 
cancer, 348 (12.0%) received SRS; and of 769 pa-
tients with CRC, 151 (19.6%) received SRS (Table 
1). The overall utilization rate for SRS increased 
from 9.8% in 2004 to 25.6% in 2014 (P<.001), with 
an average annual increase of 1.6% per year (Figure 
1). The annual increase of SRS uptake was higher 
from 2009 to 2014 than from 2004 to 2009 (2.6% vs 
0.5% per year, respectively).
Predictors of SRS Use
Predictors of SRS use on UVA and MVA with ORs 
and confidence intervals are shown in Table 2. On 
MVA, predictors of higher SRS use were later year 
of diagnosis; melanoma, CRC, or NSCLC compared 
with breast cancer; private insurance, Medicare, or 
Medicaid compared with no insurance; residence in 
zip code with a higher rate of high school education; 
and greater distance from facility. Predictors of lower 
SRS use were black race, Hispanic ethnicity, CDS 2, 
residence in zip code with lower median household 
income, and nonacademic reporting facility. MVA 
excluding patients with melanoma demonstrated 
similar results (data not shown).
SRS Uptake in Clinical and Sociodemographic 
Subgroups
SRS use increased across all disease sites during the 
study period (supplemental eFigure 2). From 2004 to 
2014, the proportion of patients receiving SRS in-
creased from 9.8% to 25.0% for NSCLC, 7.9% to 
18.8% for breast cancer, 4.8% to 40.6% for CRC, 
and 12.7% to 36.2% for melanoma. According to 
linear regression approximation, SRS increased most 
for patients with melanoma (β=2.13) compared 
with those with NSCLC (β=1.28; P<.001) and 
breast cancer (β=1.02; P<.001), although was simi-
lar to uptake in patients with CRC (β=2.09; P=.96). 
SRS use increased more for patients with income 
≥$63,000 than for those with lower income (β=1.86 
vs 1.13; P<.001; Figure 2A); more for patients with 
private insurance (β=1.64) than those with Medi-
care (β=1.29; P=.001), Medicaid (β=.99; P=.06 [rel-
ative to Medicare]), or no insurance (β=.74; P=.01 
[relative to Medicaid]) (Figure 2B). SRS use also 
increased more for patients treated at academic ver-
sus nonacademic facilities (β=2.26 vs 1.01; P<.001) 
(Figure 2C); for patients in regions with a greater 
level of high school education (β=1.48 vs 1.10; 
P<.001) (Figure 2D); and among Hispanic versus 
black patients (β=1.69 vs 1.28; P=.03), but not more 
than among white patients (β=1.34; P=.06) (supple-
mental eFigure 3). 
Facility-Level Analysis of SRS Uptake
Among the study population, 73,077 patients 
(96.2%) received at least part of their treatment at 
the reporting facility, with a total of 1,207 treatment 
facilities reporting cases from 2004 to 2014. Not all 
facilities reported cases every year, and the number 
of facilities reporting yearly ranged from a low of 
913 to a high of 1,044. The number of SRS facilities 
increased yearly from 285 (31.2%) in 2004 to 515 
(50.4%) in 2014 (Figure 3).
Survival Trends Analysis
Among the 67,448 patients in the survival analysis, 
1-year actuarial overall survival was 26.6% for the 
entire population; 1-year survival was 40.9% for SRS 
patients and 24.1% for non-SRS patients (P<.001). 
One-year survival increased for patients with each 
year of diagnosis, from 21.3% in 2004 (95% CI, 
20.2%–22.4%) to 31.5% in 2013 (95% CI, 30.6%–
32.6%) (Figure 4). From 2004 to 2013, 1-year sur-
vival increased from 24.1% (95% CI, 20.6%–28.3%) 
to 49.6% (95% CI, 47.4%–52.0%) among SRS pa-
tients, and from 21.0% (95% CI, 19.8%–22.2%) 
to 26.3% (95% CI, 25.3%–27.5%) in non-SRS 
 
patients.

Discussion
In this large national database analysis of 4 of the 
malignancies most commonly associated with brain 
metastases, overall use and adoption of upfront SRS 
for RT of brain metastases increased steadily from 
2004 to 2014, although remaining modest overall. In 
the most recent study year, 50% of facilities did not 
report using brain SRS, demonstrating potential ac-
cess barriers to SRS use. The study further revealed 
socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in the 
use and uptake of SRS. Finally, findings showed im-
provement in 1-year survival among patients with 
metastatic cancer receiving brain RT over the course 
of the study period. This improvement was seen pre-
dominantly in patients selected to receive SRS, al-
though causality cannot be determined. 
This study provides an overview of the use and 
adoption of brain SRS in the modern era of RT for 
brain metastases, serves as a foundation for further 
research into drivers of uptake and disparities, and 
highlights the need for prospective comparative ef-
fectiveness research in this area. 
To our knowledge, no prior study has investigat-
ed the use and uptake of brain SRS across multiple 
disease sites and age groups. Our findings expand on 
prior study of SRS use for NSCLC brain metastases

crease in SRS use to 8.2% by 2005.9 Although direct 
comparison is not possible given substantial differ-
ences in the patient populations, our study is in line 
with these results, with an SRS use rate of 11.1% in 
the NCDB NSCLC subgroup in 2005. Our results 
suggest that the trend of increasing SRS use has not 
only continued but also accelerated during the most 
recent years.
Management of brain metastases is evolving, and 
the specific reasons for the increasing use of brain 
SRS remain unclear. RT recommendations for brain 
metastases vary widely and are dependent on the pa-
tient’s performance status (PS) and extent of system-
ic and intracranial disease. Even with these clinical 
parameters defined, national guidelines leave ample 
room for clinician preference in using SRS and/or 
conventional WBRT in most clinical situations.6,15 
Over the past decade, findings from several clinical 
trials have supported the use of SRS for brain metas-
tases. Results of RTOG 9508, published during the

vival in patients with a single intracranial metasta-
sis receiving brain SRS after WBRT and improved 
local control, PS, and steroid requirement for pa-
tients with up to 3 lesions.7 Three randomized trials 
published during the early-to-mid part of our study 
period suggested that SRS alone, without WBRT, 
had equivalent survival and was associated with rela-
tively improved neurocognitive outcomes.8,10,11 The 
timing of publication of these studies coincides with 
an observed increase in the uptake of SRS. During 
our study period, multiple institutional SRS series 
were published, demonstrating promising efficacy for 
up to, and beyond, 10 intracranial lesions,20–22 in el-
derly patients,23 and in the postoperative setting,24 
indicating an increased practitioner comfort level 
with brain SRS for a number of clinical situations.

less SRS systems,26 which may have contributed to 
increased uptake.
Although SRS use increased substantially dur-
ing the study period, it continues to be used in a low 
percentage of patients receiving brain RT overall. 
Whether the low overall rate is appropriate based 
on evidence-driven recommendations is unclear. 
Low overall SRS use may be due to clinical con-
siderations, such as the presence of a high number 
of brain lesions, poor expected patient survival, di-
minished regional brain control, and lack of sur-
vival benefit compared with WBRT in randomized 
trials. Additionally, a recent secondary analysis of 
the JROSG 99-1 randomized trial suggested that pa-
tients with good prognoses may benefit from use of 
WBRT upfront followed by SRS compared with SRS 
alone.27 However, the low use rate may also reflect 
institutional biases, barriers to patient access, and 
cost concerns. A recent multi-institutional study 
suggested that the availability of on-site SRS was the 
most predictive factor for its use.28 The study indi-
cates that access to SRS-equipped institutions may 
remain a barrier to SRS receipt, given that 50% of 
facilities in 2014 did not report a single patient who 
received brain SRS. 
Additionally, our findings demonstrate differenc-
es in SRS uptake across socioeconomic groups. Pa-
tients from less wealthy and less educated areas and 
with Medicaid or lack of insurance were less likely to 
receive SRS, and this gap widened during the study 
period. Disparities across racial and ethnic groups are 
also seen, with black and Hispanic patients less likely 
to receive SRS overall, although uptake across race 
and ethnicity subgroups was equivalent during the 
study period. Much of the increase in SRS use ap-
pears to be driven by patients treated at academic fa-
cilities, which may have greater resources and multi-
disciplinary expertise necessary for directing an SRS 
program. Of note, we were not able to account for 
extent of intracranial or extracranial disease or PS,

which may confound these results, because it is pos-
sible that patients from lower socioeconomic back-
grounds and with inferior insurance present with a 
greater burden of disease that precludes them from 
receiving brain SRS. It would be less likely, however, 
that this phenomenon would explain the growing 
disparity within these groups during the study period.
A diagnosis of melanoma was most highly as-
sociated with receipt of SRS, followed by CRC, 
NSCLC, and breast cancer. Rate of SRS use also 
increased most rapidly in melanoma, followed by 
CRC, NSCLC, and breast cancer. The association 
between SRS and melanoma is likely in part due to 
a general belief that SRS can be effective in treat-
ing radioresistant histologies,13 and to the successful 
incorporation of immunotherapy in the treatment of 
metastatic melanoma in the past 2 decades. Interest-
ingly, CRC saw a dramatic increase in SRS use in the 
final year of the study period, although given the low 
number of patients with CRC overall, it is difficult 
to determine whether this is a statistical anomaly or 
indicates an actual trend.
This study showed that survival for patients re-
ceiving brain RT for metastatic disease is improving, 
and that this improvement is largely observed in pa-
tients selected to receive SRS. Although survival for 
SRS and non-SRS patients was similar in the early 
years of the study period, the discrepancy increased 
substantially in subsequent years. 
The observed survival improvement during the 
study period is likely multifactorial. Substantial im-
provements in systemic therapy for metastatic dis-
ease have occurred during the past decade, including 
the advent of targeted agents and immunotherapy, 
which is likely improving survival in these patients. 
Given these improvements, it is plausible that more 
patients are becoming eligible for SRS.29,30 It is also 
possible that intracranial control has become more 
important in prolonging survival.27,31 Whether the 
increase in SRS use itself is causative for improved 
survival cannot be deduced from this study, and 
given the significant selection biases between the 
treatment cohorts and lack of potential confounder 
variables in the NCDB, we did not attempt such an 
analysis. 
There are several additional limitations to this 
study. The NCDB captures only first-course treat-
ment of particular diagnoses, and thus we cannot 
exclude the possibility that patients receiving SRS 
later went on to receive WBRT, or that patients in 
the non-SRS cohort went on to receive SRS later in 
their disease course. This study is only able to assess 
the upfront treatment strategy for patients. Despite 
this limitation, we believe the study adds valuable 
information in assessing the overall landscape of 
SRS use in the current management of brain metas-
tases. The NCDB also lacks information regarding 
number of brain metastases, an important factor in 
the consideration of brain SRS use. 
Although SRS is likely better accepted and more 
widely used in patients with ≤3 brain metastases, the 
NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for 
Central Nervous System Cancers6 now list SRS as 
an option for select patients with >3 brain metasta-
ses who have low tumor volume and good PS. There 
are several other important variables lacking in the 
NCDB that may confound the associations observed 
in our MVA regression analysis, including PS, ex-
tent of intracranial and extracranial disease, neuro-
logic symptoms, and systemic therapy details, and 
we cannot control for this possibility. Additionally, 
although the NCDB captures approximately 70% of 
new cancer diagnoses, a recent study has suggested 
that, compared with population-based registries, 
Hispanic patients and certain geographic regions 
and diagnoses may be underrepresented within the 
NCDB, which may limit the generalizability of our 
results to the entire US population.32 However, the 
NCDB has the benefit of specific radiation site, mo-
dality, dose, and fractionation information, as well as 
the ability to conduct facility-level analyses, making 
it a particularly well-suited source for this study.
Conclusions
This national database analysis demonstrates steadi-
ly increasing—although modest overall—use and 
adoption of brain SRS in the United States during 
the past decade. The study identifies progressively 
widening sociodemographic disparities in the adop-
tion of SRS, likely related to lack of access to this 
important technique. Further research is needed to 
determine the reasons for these worsening disparities 
and their clinical implications on intracranial con-
trol, neurocognitive toxicities, quality of life, and 
survival for patients with brain metastases.
