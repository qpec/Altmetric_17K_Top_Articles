BACKGROUND: The results of the National Lung Screening Trial showed a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 6.7% reduc-
tion in all-cause mortality when high-risk patients were screened with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) versus chest x-ray
(CXR). The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a grade B recommendation for LDCT screening, and the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services and private insurers now cover the screening cost under certain conditions. The purpose of this study was
to assess the knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of LDCT screening for lung cancer among family physicians. METHODS: A 32-
item questionnaire was distributed to members of the South Carolina Academy of Family Physicians in 2015. Descriptive statistics
were calculated. RESULTS: There were 101 respondents, and most had incorrect knowledge about which organizations recommended
screening. Many physicians continued to recommend CXR for lung cancer screening. Most felt that LDCT screening increased the
odds of detecting disease at earlier stages (98%) and that the benefits outweighed the harms (75%). Concerns included unnecessary
procedures (88%), stress/anxiety (52%), and radiation exposure (50%). Most physicians discussed the risks/benefits of screening with
their patients in some capacity (76%); however, more than 50% reported making 1 or no screening recommendations in the past year.
CONCLUSIONS: Most family physicians report discussing LDCT with patients at high risk for lung cancer; however, referrals remain
low. There are gaps in physician knowledge about screening guidelines and reimbursement, and this indicates a need for further edu-
cational outreach. The development of decision aids may facilitate shared decision-making discussions about screening, and targeted
interventions may improve knowledge gaps. Cancer 2016;000:000–000. V

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States.1,2 Nationwide, approximately 221,200 new cases
of lung cancer will be diagnosed, and 158,040 lung cancer deaths are expected in 2015.1 These will include 4040 new cases
and 2970 deaths in South Carolina.1 Approximately 75% of lung cancers are diagnosed at a locally advanced or metastatic
stage (stages IIIB and IV)3 with very low 5-year survival rates (4%).1 Screening with low-dose computed tomography
(LDCT) is one tool that may increase the early detection of lung cancer and reduce lung cancer mortality. The National
Lung Screening Trial (NLST) randomized more than 53,000 adults at high risk for lung cancer (defined as adults aged
55-74 years who had a 30-pack-year smoking history and currently smoked or had quit within the past 15 years) to receive
3 annual screenings with LDCT or chest x-ray (CXR). The study demonstrated 20% and 6.7% reductions in lung cancer
and all-cause mortality, respectively, with annual LDCT.4 The authors reported that 320 LDCT screenings were needed
to prevent 1 lung cancer death. A subsequent cost-effectiveness study of the NLST has shown that LDCT screening costs
an additional $1631 per person or $81,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained in comparison with no screening, which
is well below the $100,000 threshold that some experts consider to be a reasonable value in the United States.5

Original Article
 In 2014, the US Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) issued a grade B recommendation for LDCT
as a tool for the detection of lung cancer in high-risk
patients (defined similarly to NLST high-risk patients
with the addition of those aged 75-80 years).6 Under the
Affordable Care Act, preventive services with USPSTF
grade B recommendations or higher are required to be
covered by private insurers.7 The Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS) subsequently issued a deci-
sion memo recommending coverage of LDCT for lung
cancer screening in February 2015.8 CMS determined
that evidence was sufficient to add annual LDCT screen-
ing as a preventive service benefit for those at high risk for
lung cancer who meet specific eligibility criteria: they are
55 to 77 years old, are asymptomatic for lung cancer, have
a tobacco smoking history of at least 30 pack-years, are a
current or former smoker (they quit within the past 15
years), and have documentation of a counseling and
shared decision-making visit before LDCT screening.
CMS requires physicians to document fulfillment of these
criteria in the medical record/LDCT order to receive
reimbursement. Billing specialists should use the newly
announced Healthcare Common Procedure Coding Sys-
tem codes for the shared decision-making visit (G0296)

a The number of total responses to each question varied across the survey
because the survey (both the online and paper versions) did not require
that respondents answer a question before they moved on to the next one.
Thus, some participants left select questions blank, and this altered the
number of responses across various questions. In addition, for some ques-
tions, more than 1 answer choice could be selected.

 and LDCT scan (G0297). Claims must also include code
V15.82 or Z87.891 to indicate a personal history of
tobacco use or nicotine dependence.9
In addition, CMS requires that LDCT lung cancer
screening be conducted at facilities that use a volumetric
computed tomography dose index � 3.0 mGy for
standard-size patients, use a standard lung nodule identifi-
cation, classification, and reporting system, make smok-
ing cessation interventions available to current smokers,
and participate in a CMS-approved lung cancer screening
registry. Finally, the reading radiologist must be board-
certified (or eligible) by the American College of Radiol-
ogy or an equivalent organization, maintain and docu-
ment training in diagnostic radiology and radiation
safety, have supervised or directly interpreted at least 300
chest computed tomography scans in the past 3 years, and
provide documentation of participation in continuing
medical education.8
Although the USPSTF, CMS, and multiple profes-
sional societies and organizations now publicly support the
use of LDCT screening for high-risk patients,6,8,10-14 some
groups assert that the current evidence is still insufficient to
endorse adoption of LDCT. The American Academy of
Family Physicians (AAFP) is one such organization; it
states that there is not enough evidence to either recom-
mend or discourage the use of LDCT screening for lung
cancer in high-risk patients. Its statement describes several
concerns, including the fact that the USPSTF decision was
based primarily on the results of the NLST, which was
conducted at major medical centers with strict protocols in
place for lung nodule follow-up. The AAFP states that the
results of the NLST may not be replicable in the commu-
nity setting. The AAFP also has concerns related to the
potential harms of long-term radiation exposure and
follow-up testing as well as cost-effectiveness. The purpose
of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and
practice patterns related to lung cancer screening with
LDCT among family physicians in general and among
AAFP physician members in particular.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A questionnaire was drafted by a team of family physi-
cians, lung cancer experts, and epidemiologists and was
reviewed for content validity. Questionnaire drafts were
administered to a group of family physicians and graduate
students not involved with the study to assess the face va-
lidity of the questions and answer responses. The final
questionnaire was 32 questions and took approximately
20 minutes to complete. A variety of question types were
used (eg, multiple choice, Likert scale, and short answer)
to assess physician and practice demographics, knowledge
of LDCT screening (lung cancer screening guidelines and
insurance coverage), attitudes toward LDCT screening
(risks, benefits, and cost-effectiveness), and referral prac-
tice patterns. In addition, physicians were presented with
clinical vignettes and were asked about their propensity to
recommend no screening, screening with CXR, or screen-
ing with LDCT for each scenario. This study was
approved by the University of South Carolina’s institu-
tional review board.
We recruited a convenience sample of family physi-
cians from the South Carolina chapter of the AAFP
(South
Carolina
Academy
of
Family
Physicians
[SCAFP]). Physicians were contacted with 2 approaches.
First, an e-mail was sent to all active members of the
SCAFP (n 5 1330) in early January 2015; this provided
them with a Web link to the Qualtrics portal15 to com-
plete the questionnaire. A follow-up e-mail reminder was
sent 2 weeks after the initial invitation.
After the announcement of LDCT screening cover-
age by CMS in February 2015, we made minor revisions
to our questionnaire to include additional questions
related to CMS coverage. Additional questionnaires
were distributed to family physicians attending the
SCAFP Summer Breakaway and Annual Assembly in
June 2015. Paper questionnaires were placed in registra-
tion bags (n 5 135); physicians were directed to submit
the completed questionnaires at our exhibitor booth.
Physicians who returned the paper questionnaire were el-
igible for a monetary incentive. Physicians who had pre-
viously completed the electronic questionnaire were also
eligible for the incentive but were asked not to complete
the paper version.
We used summary statistics, calculated by Qual-
trics,15 to describe family physicians’ knowledge, atti-
tudes, and practice patterns with respect to lung cancer
screening with LDCT. Responses were categorized; fre-
quencies and percentages are reported.
RESULTS
A total of 85 physicians started the electronic question-
naire, with 65 completing all questions. Of the 135 paper
questionnaires distributed, 16 were returned (15 physi-
cians completed all questions). Thus, our total sample
included 101 physicians.
Physician and Practice Characteristics
Most physicians were male (73%), Caucasian (88%), and
older than 40 years (86%) and had graduated from medi-
cal
school

 Approximately half of the physicians (51%) worked in
group practice, 23% worked in a hospital/university set-
ting, 8% worked in private practice, 3% worked in a com-
munity health center, and 15% worked in other settings.
Physician Knowledge
Table 1 describes physician knowledge, attitudes, and
practice patterns regarding the use of LDCT screening.
Almost all physicians (96%) reported that a computed to-
mography machine was available at a facility within 20
minutes of their practice, but nearly 40% reported being
unsure whether LDCT screening was offered at those
facilities. Physicians stated that LDCT screening should
be conducted annually (36%; the interval recommended
by the USPSTF), biannually (31%), or triannually
(31%). Physicians that completed the questionnaire after
the CMS coverage announcement were asked about Med-
icare/Medicaid coverage. Most (63%) were unsure
whether Medicare/Medicaid covers LDCT lung cancer
screening, although at the time that they completed the
questionnaire, CMS had already issued their coverage
determination.
When asked about organizations’ recommendations
regarding LDCT screening, physicians were generally ei-
ther incorrect or unsure in their answers (Table 2). The
USPSTF, American Cancer Society, National Compre-
hensive Cancer Network, and American College of Radi-
ology currently support the use of LDCT for lung cancer
screening. However, in most cases, less than half of the
physicians knew that these organizations recommend
screening. The AAFP does not currently recommend
LDCT screening; interestingly, 70% of the physicians
reported that they were unsure about the AAFP guidelines
or incorrectly believed that the AAFP does recommend
screening.
Physician knowledge was also assessed through the
use of clinical vignettes (Table 3). Physicians were pre-
sented with 4 scenarios in which the patients varied in age,
smoking status, quitting history, and family history, and
they were asked to report the screening strategy that they
recommended (no screening, screening with CXR, or
screening with LDCT). LDCT screening was recom-
mended most often for the vignette that fit USPSTF/
CMS criteria (vignette 3). For the vignette detailing a

 patient with secondhand smoking exposure and no perso-
nal smoking history (vignette 1), more than three-quarters
of the physicians (78%) correctly recommended no
screening. LDCT screening was recommended by 64% of
the physicians for patients in National Comprehensive
Cancer Network risk category 2, which reduces the age
and smoking history range for patients with another risk
factor for lung cancer (vignette 2). Almost half of the
physicians (48%) incorrectly recommended either screen-
ing with CXR or LDCT in the vignette describing a 70-
year-old former smoker (who had quit 20 years ago) with
a 30-year pack history (a scenario in which screening
would not be recommended per USPSTF/CMS criteria
or by any other professional organization; vignette 4).
Physician Attitudes
More than half of the physicians (59%) reported that they
had time to stay abreast of current cancer screening guide-
lines. When asked about the benefits of LDCT screening,
less than half (41%) believed that screening reduces lung
cancer mortality; however, almost all respondents (98%)
reported that screening increases the chances of detecting
early-stage disease. When they were asked about the risks
of LDCT screening, the greatest concerns were unneces-
sary diagnostic procedures (88%), psychological stress
and anxiety (52%), and unnecessary exposure to radiation
(50%). Almost 25% of respondents reported that another
LDCT risk is that a screening with a positive result rarely
leads to a lung cancer diagnosis (ie, the number of false-
positives are too high).
The majority of physicians agreed or strongly agreed
that LDCT screening benefits outweigh the potential
harms for high-risk patients (76%) and that scientific evi-
dence is strong enough to warrant a screening guideline
(57%; Table 4). Most physicians agreed or strongly agreed
that they would recommend LDCT screening for high-
risk patients if cost were not an issue (70%), but more
than a quarter (26%) disagreed or strongly disagreed that
LDCT screening is cost-effective. Almost all physicians
(88%) disagreed or strongly disagreed that there is no
need to educate patients about LDCT screening because,
in general, their patients want to be screened.
Physician Practice Patterns
When asked about their practice style for discussing lung
cancer screening, 73% of the physicians reported that they
discuss the risks and benefits of LDCT screening with
their high-risk patients in some capacity; however the ma-
jority did so only sometimes (24%) or infrequently
(31%). Approximately 51% of physicians stated that they
discuss risks and benefits with their patients and then let
the patient decide whether or not to proceed with screen-
ing. Only 21% present the risks and benefits and then rec-
ommend screening. Despite a high proportion of
physicians reporting that they discuss the risks and bene-
fits of LDCT screening, more than half of the physicians
had made 1 or no referrals for screening in the past year
(59%). If the physician recommends screening and the
patient initially declines, almost two-thirds of physicians
(63%) do not continue to encourage the patient to be
screened.
Approximately half of the physicians (52%) stated
that at least 1 patient had asked whether he or she could or

DISCUSSION
The translation of new knowledge into clinical practice
has long been a vexing challenge in the US health care sys-
tem. Several examples, including the 1981 Beta-Blocker
Heart Attack Trial, several studies of cholesterol lowering
medications, and research on the use of aspirin to reduce
cardiovascular events, demonstrate the disconnect in mov-
ing clinical research findings into clinical practice.16 In
each example, despite positive research findings highlight-
ing improved outcomes with the use of these medications,
the administration of the medications was suboptimal in
the general population. LDCT screening for lung cancer
is not exempt from these challenges in translating new
guidelines into primary care practice, where the majority
of screening and prevention occurs.
Overall, we found that physician knowledge on the
appropriate use of LDCT for lung cancer screening and
on the appropriate patient population for screening was
not optimal. Some physicians incorrectly recommended
screening with CXR (which is not currently recom-
mended for screening by any professional organiza-
tions)6,13 or recommended screening for patients not
categorized as high-risk. In addition, approximately two-
thirds of physicians incorrectly reported the time interval
recommended for LDCT screening.
Our finding that SCAFP family physicians lack
adequate knowledge of LDCT for lung cancer screening is
consistent with recent studies.17,18 Hoffman et al17 found
that not all providers were aware of changes in lung cancer
screening guidelines. Similarly, another study18 reported
that almost one-quarter of physicians did not know any of
the screening eligibility components (eg, age eligibility,
frequency of screening, or smoking history). Interestingly,
physicians participating in this study were all employed at
a single academic medical center that had participated in
the NLST. In both aforementioned studies as well as an
additional study conducted before the release of the
NLST results, physicians believed that lung cancer screen-
ing with CXR was appropriate.17-19 Although several
studies and this study found that physicians still use CXR
for lung cancer screening, a small, qualitative study con-
ducted in 2009 revealed that most physicians viewed
CXR as outdated and lacking efficacy for lung cancer
screening.20 Continued physician education teaching that
CXR is not recommended for lung cancer screening is still
needed.
In this study, we found that a high proportion of
physicians believed that LDCT is valuable for the early
detection of lung cancer, but a low proportion believed
that LDCT reduces lung cancer mortality. This finding is
similar to the findings of Lewis et al,18 who found that less
than one-half of physicians viewed LDCT screening as
very or moderately effective in reducing lung cancer mor-
tality. Although we did not ask physicians to compare the
efficacy of lung cancer screening with that of other cancer
screenings (eg, breast or colon cancer), physicians in Lewis
et al’s study believed lung cancer screening to be less effi-
cacious than other cancer screenings. In comparison with
other cancer screenings, LDCT is comparable or more ef-
ficacious. Mammography screening results in a 15% to
20% reduction in breast cancer mortality.21 Although the
mortality reduction of colorectal cancer screening with
colonoscopy has not been assessed with randomized clini-
cal trials,22,23 colorectal cancer screening with the fecal
occult blood test and flexible sigmoidoscopy results in
approximately 15% and 28% reductions in colorectal
cancer mortality, respectively.23,24 A large national study
of primary care physicians published in 2010 also found
that the majority of providers felt that LDCT screening
was effective in current smokers.19
Approximately half of the physicians in our study
made an LDCT screening referral in the past 12 months.
This finding is in contrast to the findings of Hoffman
et al,17 who reported that no LDCT referrals had been
made. This is an interesting result because the current
study and Hoffman et al’s study were conducted during
similar timeframes (January to June 2015 and February to
September 2014, respectively). In our study, most physi-
cians reported having a patient ask for LDCT screening
within the past 12 months, whereas the physicians in
Hoffman et al’s study reported that none of their patients
had requested a referral. Differences in physician referrals
for LDCT and patient requests for LDCT across these
studies may be due to the timing of data collection and
media attention around the CMS coverage determination
finalization that occurred in early 2015. Despite increased
media attention and referral patterns, almost two-thirds
of physicians surveyed after the CMS coverage announce-
ment were unsure whether CMS covered the cost of
LDCT screening. As private and public health insurance
reimbursement policies and procedures continue to
evolve, it is vital that physicians continue to be educated
about documentation requirements, billing codes, and
medical authorization protocols to ensure that patients do
not have to pay out of pocket for LDCT screening.

 Our study was limited by our convenience sample.
Because of the nature of surveying the SCAFP member-
ship anonymously, in multiple modes (e-mail and paper),
and at 2 different time points, it was not possible to calcu-
late a true response rate that included only unique persons
in the denominator. In addition, midway through the
study period, we revised our questionnaire to include
questions on CMS coverage, which had just been
announced. Some information bias may have occurred;
however, bias
resulting from these methodological
changes was likely to be nondifferential. Our study had
several strengths. Our sample demographics and the
SCAFP physician member database were similar, and this
indicated that our sample was representative of the
SCAFP membership. In addition, our sample consisted of
a diverse geographic mix of family physicians across South
Carolina.
The results of our study yield several areas for
improvement for lung cancer screening in family medi-
cine. First, it is clear that not all physicians are familiar
with the current recommendations for LDCT screening.
Interventions could be developed to educate family physi-
cians on the results of the NLST; they could include con-
tinuing education courses that focus on mortality
reduction among high-risk patients and candidates eligi-
ble for screening as well as tools such as cancer screening
decision aids that help physicians discuss the risks and
benefits of screening with their patients. Evidence of the
effectiveness and feasibility of cancer screening decisions
aids is substantial. Patient decision aids are known to
improve knowledge, facilitate informed, shared decision
making with their physicians, and result in decisions that
are considered compatible with the patients’ value sys-
tems.25 More research is needed to facilitate the develop-
ment and testing of lung cancer screening decision aids
for health care providers and their patients and families.
In addition, mechanisms could be put in place to help
physicians become more aware of where LDCT screening
is offered, how to make referrals to such facilities, and
how to bill for services. Patients should also be made
aware of cancer screenings available to them and encour-
aged to request and discuss these services with their health
care provider.
In conclusion, in the last 5 years, many changes to
lung cancer screening guidelines have been implemented.
Most professional organizations now support LDCT
screening, and this service is now covered for select
patients with the implementation of the Affordable Care
Act and the CMS decision memo. Interventions targeting
physician and patient education and shared decision mak-
ing are needed to effectively translate recommendations
for LDCT screening for lung cancer patients into
practice.
