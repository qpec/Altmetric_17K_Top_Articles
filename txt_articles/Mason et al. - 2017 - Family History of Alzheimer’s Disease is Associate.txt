Abstract. Early detection may be the key to developing therapies that will combat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It has been
consistently demonstrated that one of the main pathologies of AD, tau, is present in the brain decades before a clinical
diagnosis. Tau pathology follows a stereotypical route through the medial temporal lobe beginning in the entorhinal and
perirhinal cortices. If early pathology leads to very subtle changes in behavior, it may be possible to detect these changes in
subjects years before a clinical diagnosis can currently be made. We aimed to discover if cognitively normal middle-aged
adults (40–60 years old) at increased risk for AD due to family history would have impaired performance on a cognitive task
known to challenge the perirhinal cortex. Using an oddity detection task, we found that subjects with a family history of AD
had lowered accuracy without demonstrating differences in rate of acquisition. There were no differences between subjects’
medial temporal lobe volume or cortical thickness, indicating that the changes in behavior were not due to significant atrophy.
These results demonstrate that subtle changes in perceptual processing are detectable years before a typical diagnosis even
when there are no differences detectable in structural imaging data. Anatomically-targeted cognitive testing may be useful
in identifying subjects in the earliest stages of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative
disorder that irreversibly impairs cognitive processes,
most notably in the domain of memory. AD is the
most common form of dementia, accounting for an
estimated 60–80% of all dementia cases [1]. While
there are drugs on the market that may temporarily
ameliorate the symptoms of AD, there are currently
no treatments that will significantly delay, halt, or

reverse the disease course. A major difficulty facing
the development and application of disease modify-
ing therapies is that the cascade of early physiological
changes that precede clinical symptoms have not
yet been definitively identified [2]. If the earliest
pathological changes were to be detected in humans,
potential therapeutic targets could be identified and
biomarkers could be established to identify patients
before the disease becomes irreversible.
There are two pathological hallmarks of AD:
amyloid-� neuritic plaques and tau neurofibrillary
tangles [3]. Of the two factors, levels of tau pathology
are known to correlate strongly with changes in cog-
nitive function [3]. We propose that it may be possible

to detect subtle, but specific, changes to cognitive
processes mediated by areas known to exhibit early
tau pathology. Previous studies have shown that tau is
present in healthy human brains beginning as early as
20 years of age [4]. The development of tau follows
a stereotypical route through the brain, beginning in
the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices (ERC and PRC,
respectively), before entering the hippocampus [5].
Numerous avenues of research have indicated that
medial temporal lobe areas such as the ERC and PRC
sit at the junction of the ventral visual stream and
memory areas and may play a role in both visual
representation and memory [6, 7]. The perceptual
mnemonic/feature conjunction model of Bussey and
Saksida suggests that the PRC is critical for com-
bining complex features of an object into a unified
representation, and any PRC abnormalities would
result in difficulty distinguishing complex objects
while leaving memory and lower level visual pro-
cesses relatively intact [8].
Previous research has demonstrated that AD
pathology spares the primary visual areas until
advanced stages of the disease, and AD patients do
not show an impairment in most basic visual pro-
cesses such as visual acuity or color recognition [9].
Due to early pathology in the medial temporal lobe
(MTL), we believe that in the initial stages of AD,
patients have difficulty with complex visual tasks
such as differentiating visually similar objects. This
would manifest as impairments that are subtle, but
may result in confusion over medications, landmarks,
and everyday objects. Visual object processing has
also been shown to correlate with instrumental activ-
ities of daily living, indicating its importance for
maintaining independence in patients [10]. Anecdo-
tal evidence from our laboratory lends support to this
theory. For example, the husband of a patient in the
Vanderbilt Memory Disorders Clinic reported that
his spouse had difficulty remembering the location in
which she parked the car on a recent trip to the grocery
store. The patient argued that she did not have diffi-
culty remembering where she parked, but she could
not identify her car because all of the cars looked
very similar to hers. This case demonstrates the
necessity of complex object discrimination in daily
life.
Methods are being developed to visualize tau
pathology using positron emission tomography
(PET); however, this method involves the use of radi-
ation, is expensive, and is not available at all sites. If
tau pathology is present in the PRC decades before
a diagnosis, it may be possible to use anatomically
targeted cognitive testing to identify subjects who
will go on to develop AD in the future. One way
to probe the function of the PRC is a task known
as oddity detection [6]. In this task, subjects are
asked to identify the “odd man out” from several
perceptually similar items. Previous work has shown
that damage to the PRC results in a reduced ability
to distinguish similar complex objects, while dam-
age to the hippocampus results in a reduced ability
to distinguish similar scenes [7, 11]. This deficit is
particularly notable when the objects to be com-
pared contain a high degree of feature ambiguity, and
when subjects are shown unfamiliar objects such as
Greebles [6].
We aimed to determine whether it was possible to
use the oddity detection task to identify subtle cogni-
tive changes in healthy middle aged (40–60 years old)
subjects at increased risk for AD due to first-degree
family history. We did not anticipate that subjects in
this age group would exhibit overt tissue atrophy.
To confirm this, we performed structural magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and analyzed brain vol-
umesandcorticalthicknessesinmedialtemporallobe
structures. Because the PRC is associated with the
comparison of features within a single item [7, 8,
12], we hypothesized that at-risk subjects would be
impaired at distinguishing perceptually similar stim-
uli featuring a single object (faces, familiar objects,
and Greebles) compared to controls. We did not
anticipate a difference between subject groups in dis-
tinguishing scenes because scene processing involves
the hippocampus, and we did not expect that cogni-
tively intact subjects in this age group would have
hippocampal pathology. If a significant difference
was found between the at-risk group and the con-
trol group, it would indicate that early AD pathology
may indeed be affecting cognition in a subtle, yet
detectable way.
METHODS
Subjects
All subjects provided informed, written consent
in accordance with the Vanderbilt University Insti-
tutional Review Board. Middle-aged subjects (40–60
years) were recruited from the community and were
considered at risk for AD if they had at least one
biological parent who had been diagnosed with the
disease. Subjects were asked to provide the age
of onset of their parent’s symptoms. Subjects were
 E.J. Mason et al. / Perception Impaired with Family History of AD
737
excluded from the study if they reported a history
of alcohol or drug abuse, cerebrovascular disease,
traumatic brain damage, any neurological disease,
colorblindness, uncorrected vision (<20/30), uncor-
rected hearing loss, or if they were unable to undergo
MRI due to implanted metal devices or a history of
claustrophobia.
Apolipoprotein E carrier status
Apolipoprotein E �4 (ApoE4) is the most common
risk gene for AD [13] and we anticipated that the at-
risk group would have more carriers of ApoE4 than
thecontrolgroup.Subjectsweregenotypedforcarrier
status of ApoE (2, 3, 4). Buccal cells were collected
from each subject (Oragene Discover OGR-500 kit,
DNA Genotek Inc., Ottowa, ON, Canada) and DNA
was isolated and genotyped by Vanderbilt Technolo-
gies for Advanced Genomics Subjects using Applied
Biosystems Taqman 7900 HT Instrument (Life Tech-
nologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) with primers to
rs7412 and rs429358.
Neuropsychological testing
To ensure that subjects did not demonstrate overt
cognitive dysfunction, we performed a comprehen-
sive battery of neuropsychological tests including:
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Delis Kaplan
Executive Function System (DKEFS) Logical Mem-
ory Test Immediate Recall (LM-I), Delayed Recall
(LM-D), and Recognition (LM-R), Rey-Osterrieth
Visual Figure Test Copy (REYO-C), Immediate
Recall (REYO-I), and Delayed Recall (REYO-D),
DKEFS Verbal Fluency (FAS), DKEFS Semantic
Fluency (CAT), the Consortium to Establish a Reg-
istry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) Word List
Learning Immediate Recall (CERAD-I), Delayed
Recall (CERAD-D), and Recognition (CERAD-R),
Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO), Boston
Naming Test (BNT), and the Beck Depression Inven-
tory (BDI). Any subject that scored >1.5 standard
deviations below normative means on any neuropsy-
chological tests was removed from the study.
Oddity detection task
Participants’ primary task was to identify the
“odd man out” of four visually similar items, i.e.,
the one item (target) that was different from the
other three (foils). Four sets of stimuli were used
for this task: faces, objects, Greebles, and scenes.
The faces, objects, and Greebles were drawn from
the TarrLab database (courtesy of Michael J. Tarr,
Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition and Depart-
ment of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University,
http://www.tarrlab.org/. Funding provided by NSF
award 0339122.) Additional objects were drawn from
the Amsterdam Library of Object Images [14]. Scene
stimuli were photographs taken by the authors (RJM,
PCK) in the Nashville area.
The stimuli for each category were organized into
pairs according to visual similarity with one member
of the pair acting as the target item and the second
member acting as the foil. The use of each pair mem-
ber as the target stimulus was counterbalanced across
participants. For faces, objects, and scenes, visual
similarity was subjectively judged by the authors
and the foil was presented from three different view-
points. The Greeble pairs were members of the same
‘family’ and ‘gender’, and each target Greeble was
presented with three rotations of the foil Greeble
on each trial (see Fig. 1). Rotations were randomly
assigned as 0◦, 90◦, 180◦, or 270◦, with a unique
rotation for each of the four Greebles within a single
trial. All stimuli images were scaled to 300 × 300
pixels. While all stimuli sets had different view-
points of the images, only the Greeble stimuli were
inverted.
The on-screen position of the target item was ran-
domized for each trial. Beneath each item was a
digit (1, 2, 3, or 4) (see Fig. 1). Participants verbally
reported the digit that corresponded to the item they
believed to be the target to the experimenter, who then
entered the response. Due to the nature of a perceptual
discrimination task, subjects were told to emphasize
accuracy over speed. There were no response time
limits, and stimuli remained onscreen until the par-
ticipant made a decision. After a response, the next set
of stimuli were displayed on the screen. Participants
performed four blocks each consisting of a differ-
ent stimulus set. For faces and Greebles, there were
32 trials per block and for objects and scenes there
were 28 trials per block. The order of the blocks was
partially counterbalanced across participants using a
balanced Latin Square routine [15].
The stimuli were displayed on a flat screen moni-
tor (1024 × 768 pixel resolution, 75 Hz refresh rate)
using Experiment Builder (SR Research Ltd.). Partic-
ipants were seated comfortably in a chair with their
heads on a chin rest that was positioned such that
their eyes were approximately 57 cm away from the
monitor. The stimuli were 300 × 300 pixels (roughly
13 cm, 13◦ visual angle).

MRI acquisition
All neuroimaging was performed at 3T (Philips
Achieva, Best, The Netherlands) using a 32-channel
receive array head coil and a body coil for radiofre-
quency transmission. For volumetric calculations,
a T1-weighted image was acquired (MPRAGE,
TE = 3.7, TR = 8 ms, spatial resolution = 1 × 1 × 1
mm3).
Volumetric and cortical thickness analysis
The volume of the PRC, ERC, and hippocam-
pus, and the cortical thickness of the PRC and ERC
were calculated using FreeSurfer (version 5.3.0).
FreeSurfer methods for segmentation of brain vol-
umes have been previously described [16–28]. ROIs
were chosen based on regions that are known to
show the earliest AD pathology. All ROIs were
defined using atlases implemented in FreeSurfer.
Left and right hippocampal volumes were defined
using the automated segmentation routine, left and
right entorhinal volumes and cortical thickness were
parcellated using the Desikan-Killiany Atlas [29],
and left and right PRC volumes and cortical thick-
ness were parcellated using the ex vivo Broadmann
Area Atlas [30]. It is worth noting that the Broad-
mann Area Atlas defines the PRC as BA35, however
the PRC may include BA35 and BA36. Addi-
tionally, BA35 overlaps with the transentorhinal
cortex which, as previously mentioned, is the first
region to show the accumulation of tau pathol-
ogy [4]. Volumes were normalized by total brain
volume.

Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics Version 22 (IBM Corporation
Amonk, NY, USA) Specific statistical tests are
explained in detail in the results section. Statistical
significance was defined as � ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS
Subjects
A total of 34 subjects with a family history of
AD (at-risk) and 23 subjects with no family his-
tory of AD (control) completed the study. Subjects
were matched on age, sex, race, and education
(Table 1). It should be noted that at-risk subjects
trended toward higher education than control sub-
jects (p = 0.054). The average parental age of onset
of symptoms for the at-risk group was 70.5 years. As
expected, the at-risk group had more ApoE4 carriers
than the control group (p = 0.002). No differences in
neuropsychological testing, oddity detection, or neu-
roimaging were found between ApoE4 carriers and
non-carriers.
Neuropsychological testing
All subjects were cognitively normal at the time
of testing, i.e., they did not score >1.5 S.D. below
the expected range of scores for his or her age.
Subjects did not significantly differ on any neuropsy-
chological test (Table 2), although there was a trend
toward a difference in the memory portions of the
Rey-Osterrieth Complex Visual Figure Test (imme-
diate recall p = 0.05, delayed recall p = 0.08).
Oddity detection task
A correct trial was defined as a trial where the
subject correctly identified the target item. The
proportion of correct trials were subjected to a mixed-
design repeated measures Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA) with a within-subject factor of Stimulus
Type (faces, scenes, objects, and Greebles) and a
between-subject factor of Group (at-risk and con-
trol) (Fig. 2). This analysis showed a main effect of
Stimulus Type (F(3,56) = 13.8, p < 0.001) and an inter-
action of Group and Stimulus Type(F(3,156) = 3.8,
p = 0.01), but no main effect of Group (F(1,52) = 0.174,
p = 0.68). After further analysis of the interaction
using independent t-tests, a significant difference
between groups was found in the Greebles condi-
tion (t(52) = 2.28, p = 0.03). Because there was a trend
toward a difference between groups in education,
we also re-analyzed the results using an Analy-
sis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with a within-subject
factor of Stimulus Type (faces, scenes, objects,
and Greebles), a between-subject factor of Group
(at-risk and control) and years of education as a
covariate. We again found a main effect of stim-
ulus type (F3,147 = 3.302, p = 0.022), an interaction
between Stimulus Type and Group (F3,147 = 3.609,
p = 0.015), but no main effect of Group (F1,49 = 1.2,
p = 0.278). When Greebles accuracy was analyzed
using a univariate general linear model with educa-
tion as a covariate, the difference remained significant
(F2,49 = 3.37, p = 0.04). We also analyzed groups

factor of Stimulus Type (faces, scenes, objects, and
Greebles) and a between subject factor of ApoE4 Car-
rier Status (carrier and non-carrier). We did not find
an interaction of Carrier Status and Stimulus Type
(F3,150 = 0.111, p = 0.954) or a main effect of Carrier
Status (F1,50 = 0.073, p = 0.788).
To further investigate the main effect of Stim-
ulus Type, paired t-tests were used to compare
accuracy across the different stimulus types. It was
found that there was not a significant difference
between overall face accuracy and object accuracy
(t(53) = 0.99, p = 0.33); however, subjects performed
significantly better in face accuracy than scene accu-
racy (t(53) = 3.87, p < 0.001) and Greeble accuracy
(t(53) = 4.15, p < 0.001). Subjects also performed
significantly better in object accuracy than scene
accuracy (t(53) = 5.4, p < 0.001) and Greeble accu-
racy (t(53) = 5.4, p < 0.001). There was a trend for
subjects to perform better in scene accuracy than
Greeble accuracy (t(53) = 1.9, p = 0.058). In sum-
mary, face accuracy and object accuracy were higher
than scene accuracy, which tended to be higher than
Greeble accuracy.
Reaction times were collected for this task, and
entered into a mixed-design repeated measures
ANOVA with a within-subject factor of Stimulus
Type (faces, scenes, objects, and Greebles) and a
between subject factor of Group (at-risk and control).
It should again be noted that subjects were instructed
to emphasize accuracy over speed on these tasks, so
reaction time was not of primary interest. Reaction
times over all Stimuli Type tended to be long (on
average >10 s) and reaction times included the time
for the subject to verbally respond, and the experi-
menter to input the response. We found a main effect
of Stimulus Type (F3,156 = 59.4, p = <0.001), but no

main effect of Group (F1,49 = 0.035, p = 0.85), or an
interaction (F3,156 = 0.91, p = 0.44). When we fol-
lowed up on the main effect finding of stimulus type
using paired t tests we found that all stimulus types
were significantly different from all other stimulus
types (all p values <0.001). Greebles had the highest
average RT (19.828 s) followed by scenes (13.672 s),
faces (10.667 s), and objects (7.819 s).
Several subjects reported that it was difficult at
the beginning of the Greebles condition to know
what details to look for, but after a number of tri-
als it became easier. We wanted to determine if
there was indeed a learning effect in this condition
and, if so, whether the two subject groups demon-
strated different rates of learning. To accomplish this,
accuracy data from the Greebles condition was split
into tertiles for each group (Fig. 3) and subjected
to a mixed-design repeated measures ANOVA with
a within-subject factor of Tertile (first tertile, sec-
ond tertile, and third tertile) and a between-subject
factor of Group (at-risk and control). There was a
main effect of Tertile (F(2,90) = 6.50, p < 0.01) and of
Group (F(1,45) = 6.30, p = 0.02). However, there was
no interaction (F(2,90) = 0.45, p = 0.64). This indicates
that there was a learning effect in both groups, and
although at-risk group was consistently less accurate
than the control group, the two groups did not learn
at different rates.
Neuroimaging
Aftersegmentingthebrainintopre-definedregions
of interest (left and right PRC, ERC, and hippocam-
pus), volumes were calculated and normalized by
total brain volume. The cortical thickness of each cor-
tical region (the PRC and ERC) were also calculated.
The normalized volumes were entered into a multi-
variate general linear model with risk group as the
fixed factor, volume or thickness as the dependent
variable and age and sex as covariates. The corrected
model found no differences between groups in any
region studied (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Current neuropsychological testing fails to iden-
tify individuals with AD until pathology is relatively
advanced and likely irreversible. Research has shown
that AD pathology is present in the brain decades
before most diagnoses, and this pathology is likely
disrupting neuronal function in subtle ways [2].
Because tau pathology begins to accumulate in
the PRC early in life, we predicted that a task
that challenges the PRC might be able to identify
subtle behavioral differences between subjects at
risk for AD and age-matched controls. We found
that subjects at risk for AD are worse at distin-
guishing the “odd man out” when viewing Greeble
stimuli.

E.J. Mason et al. / Perception Impaired with Family History of AD
Previous studies have shown that the PRC is
involved in distinguishing stimuli with complex
visual features within a single item (i.e., faces and
objects), while the hippocampus is involved in the
perceptual processing of scenes [11]. We did not
see a difference between the groups with respect to
performance in scenes, which may indicate that hip-
pocampal functioning is intact. However, it is also
possible that the scene stimuli were less difficult to
visually process than the Greeble stimuli, as we do
not have an objective measure of task difficulty or
feature ambiguity. While we did not observe a differ-
ence between groups in real world objects or faces,
we did see a difference in the processing of Greebles.
One reason for this may be the relative novelty of
Greebles compared to objects and faces. In this case,
we use the term “novel” to describe a class of objects
that have most likely never been encountered by a
subject prior to the experiment [39, 40]. Work done
in humans, non-human primates, and rats have shown
that perirhinal neurons preferentially fire in response
to novel objects [41, 42].
While Greebles were unfamiliar items to the sub-
jects, we believe that the more likely driver of the
behavioral difference in the Greeble condition was
feature ambiguity. Feature ambiguity refers to the
degree of perceptual overlap between features on
complex objects. Human subjects with damage to the
PRC perform worse on the Odd Man Out task as fea-
ture ambiguity within items increases. Of the stimuli
that were used, subjects reported that the Greebles
contained the highest degree of feature ambiguity,
which may further explain why this stimulus in par-
ticular showed an effect between groups. Feature
ambiguity was not explicitly controlled in this task,
and studies have shown that MTL damage will result
in difficulty discriminating objects, and this difficulty
increases with feature ambiguity [43]. Future studies
should categorize by and high and low feature ambi-
guity across all stimulus types to determine if feature
ambiguity underlies the difference in Greebles, or if
there was something unique about the Greeble stimuli
such as their relative novelty to subjects.
Although the primary cognitive process being
examined in this study was perceptual discrimina-
tion of similar items, other cognitive processes are
also necessary to successfully complete this task. For
example, subjects must selectively attend to the rel-
evant features of the items that they are examining.
Selective attention has been shown to discriminate
between subjects with mild cognitive impairment, a
prodromal form of AD, and age-matched controls
[44, 45]. It has also been suggested that execu-
tive control may be impaired in subjects with mild
cognitive impairment [46]. We do not believe that
selective attention or executive control were driving
the differences in these groups for two reasons. First,
selective attention and executive control would not
likely impact the Greebles condition more than any
other condition. In particular, selective attention is
requiredfortheprocessingofthescenestimuli,which
did not differ between the two groups. Second, we
examined executive function using neuropsycholog-
ical testing and did not find any differences between
groups in any of the tests. There was an element of
learning to this task, and an argument could be made
that the at-risk subjects simply took longer to learn the
task than control subjects. However, this was not the
case (see Fig. 3). Both groups became more accurate
with time, indicating that there is a learning effect to
this task. The at-risk group consistently remained less
accurate across time compared to the control group,
but learned at a similar rate.
Unlike the other stimuli, the Greebles required
mental rotation of the images both around the x-axis
(the object remained in the same upright orientation
but was rotated left or right) and along the z-axis
(the object was turned 90◦ or 180◦ from the upright
orientation). Many studies have suggested that the
more an object needs to be mentally rotated for a task,
the higher the neural activity observed [47–49]. Men-
tally rotating an object 180◦ may require more mental
effort than rotating it laterally, so it is possible that this
extra effort may influence performance in this task. In
contrast, a previous study demonstrated that rotations
around the z axis resulted in better performance than
rotations around the x- or y-axes [50]. Another study
examined mental rotation ability in subjects at risk
for AD and found that there were no behavioral dif-
ferences in reaction time or accuracy, but there were
increases in activation in the right superior parietal
lobule, the right insula, the right middle frontal gyrus,
and the right inferior frontal gyrus [51]. In the future,
the oddity detection task could be paired with func-
tional MRI to determine if there are any differences
in activation in any of the brain areas associated with
mental rotation.
The PRC is not the only area of the brain that
is affected by early AD pathology. The ERC also
exhibits early tau pathology, and this brain region is
a potential target area for behavioral testing. Animal
studies have primarily implicated the ERC in spatial
and temporal memory [52]. Future studies may be
able to use virtual reality to test the spatial memory
 E.J. Mason et al. / Perception Impaired with Family History of AD

abilities in subjects at risk for AD. Human studies
have used neuroimaging to show that the ERC is also
involved in associative memory [53, 54], a process
that is impaired in AD [55–57]. Testing associative
memory with methods such as a face/name mem-
ory test may provide clearer insight to the earliest
processes occurring in AD.
Despite behavioral differences in the oddity detec-
tion task, there were no differences between groups in
volumetric measurements of the brain. Significant tis-
sue atrophy due to pathology has likely not occurred
at this stage [5]. Braak and Braak have demonstrated
that during the early stages of AD, tau pathology has
already begun to build in the MTL [4, 58]. It is pos-
sible that in this group of subjects, tau pathology has
already begun and is disrupting neuronal signaling
in the PRC and ERC. In subjects who will go on to
develop AD, this build-up of tau may be accelerat-
ing during middle age. While there is some evidence
that tau pathology precedes and contributes to the
development of amyloid pathology, this has yet to be
definitively proven [2]. A novel PET ligand for tau
has demonstrated that tau concentration in the MTL
is the best predictive marker of clinical function [59].
Cognitive tests do not correlate with amyloid load in
a middle aged cohort of subjects [60] and amyloid
pathology in the MTL appears to develop subsequent
to tau pathology [2]. We hypothesize that perfor-
mance in this task is likely related to tau buildup, and
future studies should include PET scanning and/or
the testing of cerebrospinal fluid for tau and amy-
loid markers to determine if this task correlates with
abnormal tau and/or amyloid pathology.
Patients who have been diagnosed with AD likely
began to accumulate pathology decades before diag-
nosis. During the early stages of the disease, this
pathology is limited and may be vulnerable to ther-
apeutic interventions. The oddity detection task may
be able to distinguish subjects at this stage based on
PRC function. A previous study demonstrated that
subjects at risk for AD develop “false memories” for
novel objects that are highly visually similar to previ-
ously seen items [61]. That study also attributed this
result to early damage in the PRC. Perhaps by devel-
oping a cognitive battery of tests of PRC function
in conjunction with physiological biomarkers (MRI,
PET scanning, cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers,
etc.), a comprehensive profile of patient function and
risk could be developed.
One issue with stratifying subjects based on family
history alone is that family history was established via
self-report. While we asked subjects questions about
their parents’ diagnoses in an attempt to establish a
true AD diagnosis, without an autopsy it would be
impossible to say for certain that the parent had AD
and not some other type of dementia. It is surprising
that there was no difference in cognitive performance
between carriers and non-carriers of the ApoE4 allele
because there is strong evidence that possession of the
ApoE4 allele results in increased risk of AD [31]. The
effect of ApoE4 on cognition throughout the lifespan
is still unclear. It has been proposed that ApoE4 may
exhibit antagonistic pleiotropy, i.e., it may be bene-
ficial in early life but lead to increased susceptibility
to disease later in life [32]. However, other studies
have failed to find an association between ApoE4 and
cognition in early life [33], later life [34], or through-
out the lifespan [35]. Subjects were relatively young
(40–60), so perhaps ApoE4 exerts its influence later
in the course of the disease. One study did find a rela-
tionship between ApoE4 carrier status and cognition
in cognitively healthy middle aged adults [36]; how-
ever, 80% of the ApoE4 carriers also had a first degree
family history of the disease, making it difficult to
tease apart the influence of ApoE4 alone. ApoE4 car-
rier status is often used as the primary determinate
of risk in studies of healthy subjects at risk for AD,
but family history may be a more powerful risk factor
for AD than ApoE4 alone. Having a first-degree rel-
ative diagnosed with the disease increases the overall
risk by 2–4 times, and AD is estimated to be 58%
heritable [37]. Additionally, ApoE4 is only one gene,
but genome-wide association studies have identified
many genes that may modify the risk of AD [38].
Future studies should stratify subjects based on fam-
ily history and no ApoE4, family history with ApoE4,
and controls (no family history, no ApoE4) to further
investigate this result.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that middle-
aged subjects at risk for developing AD demonstrate
a clear difference in perceptual processing decades
before the expected onset of the disease. This differ-
ence is most apparent in novel stimuli with a high
degree of feature ambiguity. This task may have
clinical utility in identifying subjects with early AD
pathology decades before a diagnosis.
