BACKGROUND
Brentuximab vedotin is an anti-CD30 antibody–drug conjugate that has been approved 
for relapsed and refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
METHODS
We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial involving patients 
with previously untreated stage III or IV classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma, in which 664 
were assigned to receive brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarba-
zine (A+AVD) and 670 were assigned to receive doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and 
dacarbazine (ABVD). The primary end point was modified progression-free survival (the 
time to progression, death, or noncomplete response and use of subsequent anticancer 
therapy) as adjudicated by an independent review committee. The key secondary end 
point was overall survival.
RESULTS
At a median follow-up of 24.6 months, 2-year modified progression-free survival rates 
in the A+AVD and ABVD groups were 82.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.8 to 85.0) 
and 77.2% (95% CI, 73.7 to 80.4), respectively, a difference of 4.9 percentage points 
(hazard ratio for an event of progression, death, or modified progression, 0.77; 95% CI, 
0.60 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.04). There were 28 deaths with A+AVD and 39 with ABVD (hazard 
ratio for interim overall survival, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.45 to 1.18]; P 
= 
0.20). All secondary 
efficacy end points trended in favor of A+AVD. Neutropenia occurred in 58% of the 
patients receiving A+AVD and in 45% of those receiving ABVD; in the A+AVD group, 
the rate of febrile neutropenia was lower among the 83 patients who received primary 
prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor than among those who did not 
(11% vs. 21%). Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 67% of patients in the A+AVD group 
and in 43% of patients in the ABVD group; 67% of patients in the A+AVD group who 
had peripheral neuropathy had resolution or improvement at the last follow-up visit. 
Pulmonary toxicity of grade 3 or higher was reported in less than 1% of patients receiv-
ing A+AVD and in 3% of those receiving ABVD. Among the deaths that occurred during 
treatment, 7 of 9 in the A+AVD group were associated with neutropenia and 11 of 13 
in the ABVD group were associated with pulmonary-related toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS
A+AVD had superior efficacy to ABVD in the treatment of patients with advanced-stage 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with a 4.9 percentage-point lower combined risk of progression, 
death, or noncomplete response and use of subsequent anticancer therapy at 2 years.

O
utcomes for patients with ad-
vanced-stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma have 
improved dramatically over the past half 
century.1 Although regional differences exist, the 
most commonly used frontline regimen — 
doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacar-
bazine (ABVD) — has not been modified since 
its original description in 1975.
Up to 30% of patients with stage III or IV 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma harbor refractory disease 
or relapse after frontline treatment with ABVD.2-4 
Bleomycin is associated with unpredictable and 
sometimes fatal pulmonary toxicity and is often 
dropped from later cycles of chemotherapy owing 
to pulmonary symptoms.5,6 Recent studies sug-
gest that response-adapted therapy guided by 
interim positron-emission tomography (PET) with 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose can provide a more indi-
vidualized treatment approach, in which treat-
ment intensity is de-escalated or intensified de-
pending on the early response to treatment.7,8 
Efforts are also being made to incorporate new 
drugs into established backbone regimens to 
improve efficacy and reduce toxicity.9
CD30 is a characteristic surface antigen ex-
pressed on Reed–Sternberg cells in classic Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma.10 Brentuximab vedotin is an anti-
body–drug conjugate composed of an anti-CD30 
monoclonal antibody conjugated by a protease-
cleavable linker to the microtubule-disrupting 
agent monomethyl auristatin E. Brentuximab 
vedotin has been approved for the treatment of 
classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after failure of autolo-
gous stem-cell transplantation or after two or 
more multiagent chemotherapy regimens in pa-
tients who are not candidates for transplantation. 
The drug has also been approved as post-trans-
plantation consolidation therapy for patients with 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma who are at increased risk 
for relapse or progression.11,12
A previous phase 1, dose-escalation trial in-
volving patients with advanced Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma evaluated the use of frontline brentux-
imab vedotin combined with either ABVD or 
doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD).13 
Brentuximab vedotin plus AVD (A+AVD) had an 
acceptable side-effect profile and resulted in 
complete response in 24 of 25 patients (96%). 
Long-term follow-up showed a 5-year failure-free 
survival rate of 92% and an overall survival rate 
of 100% with A+AVD.14 On the basis of these 
findings, ECHELON-1, a large, international, 
open-label, randomized, multicenter, phase 3 trial 
was conducted to compare A+AVD with ABVD as 
frontline therapy in patients with stage III or IV 
classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Methods
Trial Design
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive A+AVD (1.2 mg of brentuximab vedotin 
per kilogram of body weight, 25 mg of doxoru-
bicin per square meter of body-surface area, 6 mg 
of vinblastine per square meter, and 375 mg of 
dacarbazine per square meter) or ABVD (25 mg 
of doxorubicin per square meter, 10 units of 
bleomycin per square meter, 6 mg of vinblastine 
per square meter, and 375 mg of dacarbazine per 
square meter) intravenously on days 1 and 15 of 
each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Brentuximab 
vedotin was administered over 30 minutes, start-
ing within approximately 1 hour after comple-
tion of AVD. Dose reductions and modifications 
are described in Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this arti-
cle at NEJM.org. Patients were stratified accord-
ing to region (Americas vs. Europe vs. Asia) and 
International Prognostic Score (IPS) risk group 
(low risk vs. intermediate risk vs. high risk). The 
IPS ranges from 0 to 7, with a score of 0 or 1 in-
dicating low risk of treatment failure, a score of 
2 or 3 intermediate risk, and a score of 4 to 7 high 
risk (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix).15 The results of PET conducted at the end of 
the second 28-day cycle of treatment (hereafter 
referred to as PET2) guided an optional switch 
to alternative frontline therapy at the treating 
physician’s discretion for patients with a Deau-
ville score of 5. The Deauville score is a 5-point 
scale on which higher scores indicate greater 
uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose at involved sites 
on PET. A score of 1 indicates no uptake, a score 
of 2 uptake at an initial site that is less than or 
equal to the uptake at the mediastinum, a score 
of 3 uptake at an initial site that is greater than 
uptake at the mediastinum but less than or 
equal to uptake at the liver, a score of 4 uptake 
at an initial site that is moderately increased as 
compared with the uptake at the liver, and a 
score of 5 markedly increased uptake at any site 
or uptake at a new site of disease.16

Brentuximab Vedotin in Advanced Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
col (available at NEJM.org) was approved by in-
stitutional review boards and ethics committees 
at individual sites, and adhered to Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines (as defined by the Interna-
tional Conference on Harmonisation). A steering 
committee and an independent data and safety 
monitoring committee oversaw the conduct of 
the trial, and all the patients provided written 
informed consent.
The trial was designed by a committee con-
sisting of six authors plus representatives of the 
sponsors, Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Seattle 
Genetics. Data were collected and trial proce-
dures were overseen by trial investigators. Data 
were verified by the sponsors, analyzed by spon-
sor statisticians, and interpreted by academic 
authors and sponsor representatives. The manu-
script was prepared by the authors with the as-
sistance of a medical writer funded by the spon-
sors. All the authors had full access to the data, 
vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the 
data and adherence of the trial to the protocol, 
and had final responsibility for the manuscript 
content and the decision to submit the manu-
script for publication.
Patients
Patients were 18 years of age or older and had 
histologically confirmed advanced classic Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma (Ann Arbor stage III or IV, as 
determined on a 4-point scale, with higher 
stages indicating more widespread disease),17 ac-
cording to the World Health Organization clas-
sification system.18 Patients who had not been 
previously treated with systemic chemotherapy 
or radiotherapy were eligible. Patients were re-
quired to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (on a scale 
of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater 
disability)19; satisfactory absolute neutrophil counts 
(≥1500 per cubic millimeter), platelet counts 
(≥75,000 per cubic millimeter), and hemoglobin 
levels (≥8 g per deciliter) (with the exception of 
patients with involvement of the marrow); satis-
factory levels of markers of liver function (total 
bilirubin level, <1.5 times the upper limit of 
normal [with the exception of patients with Gil-
bert’s syndrome] and alanine aminotransferase 
or aspartate aminotransferase levels, <3 times 
the upper limit of normal [with the exception of 
patients with involvement of the liver]); and sat-
isfactory levels of markers of kidney function 
(serum creatinine level, <2.0 mg per deciliter 
[177 μmol per liter]; creatinine clearance or cal-
culated creatinine clearance, >40 ml per minute; 
or both). Patients with nodular lymphocyte-
predominant Hodgkin’s lymphoma were ineligi-
ble, as were those with peripheral sensory or 
motor neuropathy, a positive pregnancy test, 
known cerebral or meningeal disease, any evi-
dence of residual disease from another cancer, 
diagnosis of another cancer within 3 years be-
fore the first dose, or any clinically relevant 
cardiovascular conditions.
End Points
The primary end point was modified progression-
free survival, defined as time to disease progres-
sion, death, or modified progression (with the 
latter defined as evidence of noncomplete re-
sponse after completion of frontline therapy ac-
cording to review by an independent committee, 
followed by subsequent anticancer therapy). This 
end point was chosen specifically to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the primary chemotherapy and 
encompasses three possible outcomes, each of 
which represents a failure of the primary chemo-
therapy to eliminate Hodgkin’s lymphoma: docu-
mented progression20 at any time after initiation 
of primary chemotherapy, death from any cause, 
and detection of a response that was less than 
complete at the end of primary chemotherapy 
(Deauville score of 3, 4, or 5 on a PET scan), fol-
lowed by the delivery of subsequent anticancer 
therapy. The latter outcome was considered to be 
an event only if noncomplete response was con-
firmed during review by an independent com-
mittee, whose members were unaware of group 
assignments, and was followed by the delivery of 
subsequent anticancer treatment that was not 
specified in the protocol. Additional justifica-
tions for, and explanation of, this choice of pri-
mary end point are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix. Timing of the modified progression 
event was the date on which the first PET scan 
was obtained after completion of frontline ther-
apy, showing the absence of complete response. 
In the absence of disease progression, a switch 
to an alternative frontline therapy before com-
pletion of primary chemotherapy with the ran-
domized regimen was not considered to be an 
event.
The key secondary end point was overall sur-
vival, defined as the time from randomization to 
death from any cause. Other secondary and ex-
ploratory end points are described in the protocol.

Assessments
Response and progression were evaluated in ac-
cordance with the Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma.20 Computed tomograph-
ic scans were obtained at screening, at the end 
of cycle 2, after administration of the last dose of 
frontline therapy, and during the follow-up 
period (every 3 months for the first year and 
every 6 months thereafter). PET scans were ob-
tained at screening, at the end of cycle 2, and at 
the end of treatment. Safety outcomes were the 
incidence of adverse events (defined according to 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA], version 19.0, and the National Can-
cer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4.03) and changes in vital 
signs and laboratory test results.
Statistical Analysis
According to statistical calculations, an estimated 
260 modified progression-free survival events 
would give the trial 90% power to detect a haz-
ard ratio for disease progression, death, or modi-
fied progression of 0.67 at a one-sided signifi-
cance level of 0.025. The trial was powered on 
the following assumption: a 2-year modified 
progression-free survival of 81% for patients in 
the A+AVD group and 73% for patients in the 
ABVD group. Randomization of approximately 
1240 patients was planned to achieve (with 95% 
probability) 260 modified progression-free surviv-
al events. The primary end point was summa-
rized with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method 
and evaluated with the use of a stratified log-
rank test. A stratified Cox regression model was 
used to estimate the hazard ratio and the 95% 
confidence interval for the treatment effect. The 
stratification factors included region and IPS 
risk group at baseline. The interim analysis for 
overall survival was to be performed if the result 
of the primary analysis was statistically signifi-
cant. The final overall survival analysis will be 
performed after 112 deaths have occurred. Over-
all type I error for the overall survival analysis 
will be controlled with the use of the O’Brien–
Fleming method with the Lan–DeMets alpha 
spending function.
All efficacy evaluations were performed in 
the intention-to-treat population unless otherwise 
specified. Safety was analyzed in patients who 
received at least one dose of the trial drug (the 
safety population).
Results
Patients
From November 19, 2012, through January 13, 
2016, a total of 1334 patients at 218 sites in 21 
countries were randomly assigned to receive 
A+AVD (664 patients) or ABVD (670 patients) 
(intention-to-treat population) (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Overall, 58% of the 
patients were men, 64% had stage IV disease, 
62% had extranodal involvement at diagnosis, 
59% had B symptoms (i.e., weight loss, night 
sweats, and fever), and the median age was 36 
years (34% of patients were ≥45 years of age). 
Baseline characteristics were generally well bal-
anced between the two groups (Table 1, and 
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy
After a median follow-up of 24.6 months (range, 
0 to 49.0), the rate of the primary end point of 
independently determined modified progression-
free survival was significantly higher in the 
A+AVD group than in the ABVD group (2-year 
modified progression-free survival rate, 82.1% 
[95% confidence interval {CI}, 78.8 to 85.0] vs. 
77.2% [95% CI, 73.7 to 80.4]; hazard ratio for 
progression, death, or modified progression, 0.77 
[95% CI, 0.60 to 0.98]; P 
= 
0.04), corresponding 
to a 23% risk reduction (Fig. 1A). Events of pro-
gression, death, or modified progression oc-
curred in 117 patients in the A+AVD group and 
in 146 patients in the ABVD group; disease 
progression occurred in 90 and 102 patients, 
respectively; death from any cause in 18 and 22 
patients, respectively, and receipt of subsequent 
anticancer therapy after failure to achieve a com-
plete response at the completion of frontline 
therapy (modified progression) in 9 and 22 pa-
tients, respectively (Table 2). The majority (71%) 
of these subsequent anticancer therapies con-
sisted of salvage chemotherapy (7 of 9 patients 
in the A+AVD group and 15 of 22 patients in the 
ABVD group), with radiotherapy given to the 
remainder of patients in both groups (Table S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Modified pro-
gression events assigned because of an end-of-
treatment PET scan and subsequent treatment 
were predominantly associated with a Deauville 
score of 4 or 5 (a score of 3 was recorded in 7 of 
31 patients [23%], a score of 4 in 10 of 31 patients 
[32%], and a score of 5 in 14 of 31 patients

There were 58 patients at risk for a modified progression event (end-of-treatment Deauville score ≥3 and no progressive 
disease at the end of treatment): 19 in the group receiving A+AVD versus 39 in the group receiving ABVD. However, only 
9 patients in the A+AVD group and 22 patients in the ABVD group actually had a modified progression event because they 
received subsequent treatment. PET denotes positron-emission tomography, and PFS progression-free survival.
†  
Salvage chemotherapy included the terms chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy plus transplantation, and immuno-
therapy according to medical review.
‡  
The Deauville score is a 5-point scale on which higher scores indicate greater uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose at in-
volved sites on PET. A score of 1 indicates no uptake, a score of 2 uptake at an initial site that is less than or equal to 
the uptake at the mediastinum, a score of 3 uptake at an initial site that is greater than uptake at the mediastinum but 
less than or equal to uptake at the liver, a score of 4 uptake at an initial site that is moderately increased as compared 
with uptake at the liver, and a score of 5 markedly increased uptake at any site or uptake at a new site of disease. The 
absence of complete response at the end of primary chemotherapy was defined as a Deauville score of 3, 4, or 5.

Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of modified progression-free survival, by treatment group, according to the independent review 
committee. The hazard ratio for treatment with A+AVD versus ABVD and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were based on a stratified 
Cox proportional-hazards regression model, with treatment as the explanatory variable. Stratification factors included region and Inter-
national Prognostic Score risk group at baseline. Panel B shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of modified progression-free survival, by treat-
ment group, according to investigators. In Panels A and B, circles indicate censored data. A+AVD denotes brentuximab vedotin plus 
doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, and ABVD doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine.

[45%]); these events also met the criteria for a 
progression event according to investigator as-
sessment. Of note, only 7 of the 21 patients with 
a Deauville score of 3 on the end-of-treatment 
PET scan went on to receive additional therapy 
and were therefore determined to have had a 
modified progression event (2 patients in the 
A+AVD group and 5 patients in the ABVD group; 
Tables 2 and 3).
According to investigator assessment, the 
2-year modified progression-free survival rate was 
81.0% (95% CI, 77.6 to 83.9) with the A+AVD 
regimen versus 74.4% (95% CI, 70.7 to 77.7) with 
the ABVD regimen, corresponding to a 28% 
lower overall risk of an event among patients 
treated with A+AVD than among those treated 
with ABVD (hazard ratio for progression, death, 
or modified progression, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 
0.91; P 
= 
0.006) (Fig. 1B). There was 91% concor-
dance between independent review and investi-
gator determination of a modified progression-
free survival event.
Prespecified subgroup analyses of modified 
progression-free survival showed a hazard ratio 
of less than 1 for the A+AVD regimen versus the 
ABVD regimen in the majority of subgroups 
(Fig. 2). Certain subgroups of patients appeared 
to benefit more with A+AVD than with ABVD.

Brentuximab Vedotin in Advanced Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
These subgroups included patients from North 
America, patients with involvement of more than 
one extranodal site, patients with an IPS indicat-
ing a high risk of treatment failure (scores of 
4 to 7), men, patients with stage IV disease, and 
patients younger than 60 years of age. The rates 
of negativity at PET2 (Deauville score, 1 to 3) 
were 89% with A+AVD versus 86% with ABVD.
There were 28 deaths in the A+AVD group 
(9 during treatment [within 30 days after the last 
dose of frontline therapy] and 19 during follow-
up [31 days or more after the last dose of front-
line therapy]) and 39 deaths in the ABVD group 
(13 during treatment and 26 during follow-up). 
The interim 2-year overall survival rate for the 
A+AVD group was 96.6% (95% CI, 94.8 to 97.7) 
and that for the ABVD group was 94.2% (95% 
CI, 92.0 to 95.9), which corresponded to a reduc-
Figure 2. Forest-Plot Analysis of Modified Progression-free Survival.
This forest plot shows modified progression-free survival according to the independent review committee in key prespecified subgroups. 
The hazard ratio for treatment with A+AVD versus ABVD and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were based on an unstratified Cox 
 
proportional-hazards regression model, with treatment as the explanatory variable. The intention-to-treat population included all the 
 
patients who underwent randomization. The International Prognostic Score (IPS) ranges from 0 to 7, with higher scores indicating in-
creased risk of treatment failure: low risk, 0 or 1; intermediate risk, 2 or 3; and high risk, 4 to 7. The Ann Arbor staging system ranges 
from I to IV, with higher stages indicating more widespread disease. B symptoms consist of night sweats, unexplained fever (tempera-
ture >38°C), or loss of more than 10% of body weight. Values for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
tion in the risk of death of 27% in favor of the 
A+AVD regimen (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.45 
to 1.18; P 
= 
0.20) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Results for other secondary end 
points are shown in Table 3. Only 15 of 662 
patients who received A+AVD and 9 of 659 pa-
tients who received ABVD switched to alternative 
chemotherapy during frontline therapy for reasons 
other than progressive disease (a Deauville score 
of 5 in 1 of 15 and 4 of 9 patients, respectively; 
adverse events in 12 of 15 and 1 of 9 patients, 
respectively; and other reasons in 2 of 15 and 4 of 
9 patients, respectively) (Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Overall, fewer patients in the A+AVD group 
than in the ABVD group received subsequent 
anticancer therapies. Recipients of these thera-
pies in the A+AVD group versus the ABVD group 
were as follows: radiation (in 52 patients in each 
group), chemotherapy (66 vs. 99), high-dose 
chemotherapy plus transplantation (36 vs. 54), 
immunotherapy (10 vs. 16), and chemotherapy 
plus radiation (2 vs. 3).
Safety
The median duration of treatment and the num-
ber of completed cycles were similar in the two 
groups (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The proportions of patients who received the 
regimens as intended, without dose modification 
such as delays, holds, or reductions, are shown 
in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The safety profiles for both groups are sum-
marized in Table 4, and in Table S7 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. Overall, neutropenia was 
reported in 58% of the patients receiving A+AVD 
and in 45% of the patients receiving ABVD, and 
febrile neutropenia was reported in 19% and 
8%, respectively. In both groups, the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia was higher among patients 
60 years of age or older than among those 
younger than 60 years of age (37% vs. 17% in 
the A+AVD group and 17% vs. 6% in the ABVD 
group). The incidence of febrile neutropenia was 
also higher in earlier rather than later cycles of 
therapy in both groups (9% in cycle 1 vs. 1 to 6% 
in cycles 2 through 6 in the A+AVD group and 
4% in cycle 1 vs. ≤1% in cycles 2 through 6 in 
the ABVD group). The incidence of discontinua-
tion of any trial drug due to neutropenia or fe-
brile neutropenia was 1% or less in both groups.
The rate of infections (determined in accor-
dance with the MedDRA primary system organ-
class term of “infections and infestations”) in 
the A+AVD group was 55% (361 of 662 patients) 
and the rate in the ABVD group was 50% (331 
of 659 patients); rates of infection of grade 3 or 
higher were 18% (116 of 662 patients) and 10% 
(66 of 659 patients), respectively. Discussion with 
the independent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee (after 75% of enrollment was complete) 
led to the recommendation of primary prophy-
laxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(G-CSF) for patients who were yet to be enrolled 
and who would receive the A+AVD regimen, ow-
ing to the higher incidence of febrile neutrope-
nia in that group. In the A+AVD group, the inci-
dence of febrile neutropenia was lower among 
the 83 patients who received primary prophy-
laxis with G-CSF (defined as use of G-CSF by 
day 5 of treatment) than among those who did 
not (11% [9 of 83] vs. 21% [119 of 579]) (Table 5). 
The occurrence of infections and infestations of 
grade 3 or higher was also lower among the 
patients who received G-CSF than among those 
who did not (11% [9 of 83 patients] vs. 18% [107 
of 579 patients]).
Peripheral neuropathy (determined on the ba-
sis of a standardized MedDRA query; see Table S8 
in the Supplementary Appendix) occurred in 67% 
of the patients (442 of 662) receiving A+AVD and 
43% of the patients (286 of 659) receiving ABVD. 
Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 20% 
of the patients (130 of 662) in the A+AVD group 
versus 9% of the patients (57 of 659) in the ABVD 
group, and peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or 
higher occurred in 11% of the patients (70 of 662) 
in the former group (with grade 4 occurring in 
1 patient) versus 2% of the patients (11 of 659) in 
the latter. Among patients with peripheral neu-
ropathy, a trial drug was discontinued in 10% in 
the A+AVD group (44 of 442) versus 4% in the 
ABVD group (11 of 286). Two thirds of the pa-
tients in the A+AVD group (295 of 442) who had 
peripheral neuropathy had resolution (43%, 191 
of 442) or improvement by at least one grade 
(24%, 104 of 442) in terms of events related to 
peripheral neuropathy at the time of the last 
follow-up visit; at that time, 92% of ongoing 
events related to peripheral neuropathy were 
grade 1 (64%) or grade 2 (29%) in the A+AVD 
group. Pulmonary toxicity, defined as events re-
lated to interstitial lung disease (in accordance 
with a standardized MedDRA query), was re-
ported in 2% of the patients (12 of 662) in the 
A+AVD group versus 7% (44 of 659) in the ABVD

group; events of grade 3 or higher were reported 
in less than 1% of the patients (5 of 662) in the 
former group and 3% of the patients (21 of 659) 
in the latter.
During treatment, there were 9 deaths in the 
A+AVD group and 13 deaths in the ABVD group. 
In the A+AVD group, 7 deaths were associated 
with neutropenia (all occurred in patients who 
had not received primary prophylaxis with G-CSF 
before the onset of neutropenia, with the excep-
tion of 1 patient who entered the trial with pre-
existing neutropenia) and 2 deaths were due to 
myocardial infarction. In the ABVD group, 11 
deaths were due to or associated with pulmonary-
related toxicity and 1 death was due to cardio-
pulmonary failure. The cause of 1 death was 
unknown. Among the patients enrolled in the 
trial, 37% (242 of 662) in the A+AVD group and 
28% (186 of 659) in the ABVD group were hos-
pitalized during the trial.
Fertility was not formally assessed; however, 
similar numbers of pregnancies were reported in 
each treatment group, which suggests that there 
was no significant difference in the effect on 
fertility. At the time of this analysis, a total of 78 
pregnancies were reported among trial partici-
pants and their partners (42 in the A+AVD group

This large, international, randomized phase 3 
trial involving patients who had received a recent 
diagnosis of stage III or IV classic Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma showed that treatment with bren-
tuximab vedotin plus AVD, as compared with 
standard treatment with ABVD, resulted in a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in the rate of modified progression-
free survival, with a difference at 2 years of 4.9 
percentage points as assessed by an independent 
committee, whose members were unaware of 
group assignments and 6.6 percentage points as 
assessed by the trial investigators. These out-
comes were associated with reductions in the 
overall risk of failure of the primary chemo-
therapy treatment of 23% as assessed by an in-
dependent review committee and 28% as as-
sessed by the trial investigators.
The goal of frontline chemotherapy for Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma is to cure patients without the 
need for additional therapy. Because metaboli-
cally detectable residual disease is a reliable pre-

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
dictor of imminent progression, it is accepted 
practice to initiate subsequent chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy on the basis of a positive PET scan 
at the end of frontline treatment.21-23 In this con-
text, the conventional end point of progression-
free survival does not accurately assess the cura-
tive intent of frontline chemotherapy. Thus, in 
the ECHELON-1 trial, the primary end point was 
“modified” progression-free survival, which, in 
addition to disease progression or death, included 
modified progression, defined as evidence of 
noncomplete response after the completion of 
frontline chemotherapy (based on independently 
assessed PET results) followed by subsequent 
anticancer therapy, as an event, thus accurately 
assessing the curative potential of the frontline 
chemotherapy.
The results of the interim overall survival 
analysis and all other secondary efficacy end 
points favored A+AVD, further supporting the 
conclusion that A+AVD is a more effective front-
line treatment for advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
than ABVD. Furthermore, the benefit of A+AVD 
was observed consistently in the majority of pre-
specified subgroups, including patients in whom 
there was involvement of more than one extra-
nodal site, patients with an IPS indicating high 
risk for treatment failure (4 to 7), and patients 
with stage IV disease. The rate of positivity at 
PET2 was low, and a higher proportion of the 
patients treated with A+AVD than those treated 
with ABVD had negative results at PET2 (89% 
vs. 86%).
This trial shows that the addition of brentux-
imab vedotin and the elimination of bleomycin 
from frontline therapy in the A+AVD regimen 
lowers the incidence of pulmonary toxicity while 
improving efficacy as compared with the ABVD 
regimen. No new types of risk to patient safety 
were identified, although the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia was higher than expected and an 
increased incidence of infections was noted in 
the A+AVD group. The majority of the deaths dur-
ing treatment in the A+AVD group were associ-
ated with febrile neutropenia; however, primary 
prophylaxis with G-CSF appeared to mitigate 
the increased risk of febrile neutropenia and its 
sequelae in the subgroup of 83 patients who re-
ceived primary prophylaxis, resulting in reduced 
rates of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and se-
rious infection. Peripheral neuropathy occurred 
more frequently in patients in the A+AVD group. 
The incidence of peripheral neuropathy of grade 
3 or higher was increased by 9 percentage points 
in this group as compared with the ABVD group, 
and peripheral neuropathy was largely reversible, 
either resolving or abating in 67% of the patients 
in whom the condition had developed. Both the 
percentage of patients who received subsequent 
salvage chemotherapy and the percentage of pa-

Brentuximab Vedotin in Advanced Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
tients who received high-dose chemotherapy fol-
lowed by transplantation were approximately 33% 
lower among patients treated with A+AVD than 
among patients treated with ABVD; those treat-
ed with A+AVD were therefore less likely to be 
subject to the toxicities associated with aggres-
sive salvage therapies.
The results of the ECHELON-1 trial are par-
ticularly important considering the opportunity 
A+AVD provides to administer a treatment to 
older patients that is at least equivalent in its 
effectiveness to ABVD, and to do so safely. Older 
patients with advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma rep-
resent a special group, considering their incidence 
of disease (approximately 20% of all cases), 
lower rates of treatment efficacy, and typically 
higher rates of severe toxicity, particularly the 
pulmonary toxicity that is associated with bleo-
mycin.6,24,25 When choosing frontline treatment, 
it is important to consider the lifetime burden of 
late and long-term adverse effects from salvage 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and transplantation 
(including infertility, pulmonary and cardiac tox-
icities, and secondary cancers).26,27 The A+AVD 
regimen is associated with more myelotoxicity 
(which can be ameliorated with prophylactic 
G-CSF) and neurotoxicity (which is largely re-
versible) than ABVD but substantially less pul-
monary toxicity and appears to be more effective 
for the frontline treatment of advanced-stage 
classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
