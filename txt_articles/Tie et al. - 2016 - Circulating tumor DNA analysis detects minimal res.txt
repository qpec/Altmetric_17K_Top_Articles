Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after resection of stage II colon cancer may identify patients at the highest
risk of recurrence and help inform adjuvant treatment decisions. We used massively parallel sequencing–based
assays to evaluate the ability of ctDNA to detect minimal residual disease in 1046 plasma samples from a prospective
cohort of 230 patients with resected stage II colon cancer. In patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, ctDNA
was detected postoperatively in 14 of 178 (7.9%) patients, 11 (79%) of whom had recurred at a median follow-up
of 27 months; recurrence occurred in only 16 (9.8 %) of 164 patients with negative ctDNA [hazard ratio (HR), 18;
95% confidence interval (CI), 7.9 to 40; P < 0.001]. In patients treated with chemotherapy, the presence of ctDNA
after completion of chemotherapy was also associated with an inferior recurrence-free survival (HR, 11; 95% CI,
1.8 to 68; P = 0.001). ctDNA detection after stage II colon cancer resection provides direct evidence of residual
disease and identifies patients at very high risk of recurrence.
INTRODUCTION
About 1.3 million cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed annually
worldwide (1). In patients with stage II colon cancer (~25% of all
colorectal cancer), management after surgical resection remains a
clinical dilemma, with about 80% cured by surgery alone (2). The cur-
rent approach to defining recurrence risk for patients with early-
stage colon cancer dates from the original work of C. E. Dukes (3)
in the 1930s. For patients with Dukes B cancers [stage II by TNM (tumor-
node-metastasis) classification], the risk of recurrence was subsequent-
ly refined through the recognition of other clinical and pathological
features. Incorporation of these features, such as T4 extension, bowel
perforation or obstruction, inadequate nodal sampling, poorly differ-
entiated histology, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), only modestly
affects recurrence risk (4, 5). Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) sta-
tus in the tumor defines a low-risk group in which adjuvant chemo-
therapy is not beneficial (6, 7). Most recently, multiple tissue-based
gene signatures have been shown to have prognostic significance,
but again with modest hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.4 to 3.7 (8–11).
In practice, adjuvant chemotherapy is more frequently offered
to high-risk stage II patients, with the justification that high-risk
patients are more likely to derive benefit from treatment. However,
an overall survival benefit from adjuvant therapy in patients with
stage II colon cancer, including those with high-risk disease based
on standard clinicopathologic criteria or gene signatures, remains
to be conclusively demonstrated (12–16). The challenge in demonstrat-
ing a benefit is in part due to the overall low risk of recurrence in this
patient group, requiring very large studies to demonstrate a modest
benefit from treatment. Better markers for recurrence risk would allow
a high-risk subset to be identified, the selection of which could enrich
studies designed to demonstrate adjuvant therapy benefit.
Regardless of whether patients have received adjuvant therapy,
early detection of recurrence during follow-up is associated with im-
proved survival in patients with early-stage colorectal cancer (17–20).
However, the biomarker now used as the standard of care, carcinoem-
bryonic antigen (CEA), has limited sensitivity and specificity (21, 22).
Computed tomography (CT) imaging improves detection of recur-
rence but is associated with radiation exposure and also has a high
rate of false positivity (21).
Sequencing of the DNA from colorectal cancers has identified
several genes that are recurrently somatically mutated (23, 24). These
tumor-specific DNA mutations can be detected in the cell-free com-
ponent of peripheral blood [circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)] in most
patients with metastatic disease, allowing for noninvasive molecular
characterization of tumors, including genetic changes that are revealed
by the selective pressure of targeted therapies (25–28). Additionally,
the short half-life of ctDNA (~2 hours) (29) makes ctDNA a useful

 dynamic marker of tumor bulk, with early decreases in ctDNA
amounts reflecting treatment responses that are later confirmed by
conventional imaging (30). The possibility that ctDNA could be used
to detect micrometastatic disease in patients undergoing surgery with
curative intent was suggested in an initial series of 18 patients with
advanced colorectal cancer undergoing metastasectomy (29) and also
more recently in other solid malignancies such as breast and pancre-
atic cancers (31, 32).
Here, we report on the results of a prospective correlative bio-
marker study in stage II colon cancer patients, where the primary
aim was to demonstrate that postoperative ctDNA analysis could
be used as an indicator of minimal residual disease, thereby iden-
tifying patients who would eventually develop recurrent disease de-
tected with conventional radiologic criteria. Secondary aims were to
analyze serial samples to explore changes in ctDNA concentration
over time, including any impact of adjuvant therapy on ctDNA,
and to determine whether persistently detectable ctDNA identified
treated patients who would later recur radiologically.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics and postoperative ctDNA status
Patient enrolment and study overview are presented in Fig. 1. Between
July 2011 and September 2014, we enrolled 250 patients and collected
1047 plasma samples from 231 eligible patients. We initially subjected
the resected primary tumor tissue to tar-
geted massively parallel sequencing using
the previously described Safe-SeqS assay
(26, 33). At least one somatic mutation
was identified in the primary tumor tis-
sue of 230 of 231 (99.6%) eligible cases.
For the 230 evaluable patients, we then
designed personalized Safe-SeqS assays
for the identified mutations to quantify
ctDNA in plasma samples. Twenty of
these 230 patients (8.7%) harbored the
tumor-specific mutation in their plasma
(ctDNA-positive) 4 to 10 weeks after sur-
gery, hereafter termed “postoperatively.”
Table 1 summarizes the mutations and
mutant allele fractions (MAFs) found in
the ctDNA-positive cases.
Baseline patient and pathological char-
acteristics grouped according to postoper-
ative ctDNA status for the 230 evaluable
patients are shown in Table 2. The me-
dian age was 65 years, and 57% were male.
On the basis of pathological characteris-
tics, 16% had poorly differentiated tumors,
17% had T4 disease, 13% had less than
12 lymph nodes (LNs) examined, 19%
had LVI, and 18% had dMMR tumors.
Of the 230 eligible patients, 52 (23%) pa-
tients received adjuvant chemotherapy at
their clinician’s discretion. These patients
were younger and more likely to have at
least one high-risk feature.
There was no significant association between postoperative ctDNA
status and conventional high-risk clinicopathological factors (Table 1).
As of 25 November 2015, median follow-up was 27 months (range, 2
to 52 months). During this period, 34 (14.8%) patients experienced
radiologic recurrences, including 27 of 178 (15%) patients not treated
with chemotherapy and 7 of 52 (13%) patients treated with adjuvant
chemotherapy.
Postoperative ctDNA status and recurrence in patients
not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
To avoid the confounding effect of chemotherapy, we examined the
ability of ctDNA analysis at the postoperative time point to predict
radiologic recurrence in patients not treated with adjuvant chemo-
therapy. ctDNA was detected postoperatively in 14 of 178 patients
(7.9%) not treated with chemotherapy. Radiologic recurrence was de-
tected during follow-up in 11 of these 14 patients (78.6%). Postopera-
tive ctDNA was negative in the remaining 164 of 178 (92.1%) patients,
where disease recurrence was documented in 16 (9.8%) patients.
Among all patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, CEA
was elevated postoperatively in 2 of 27 cases (7.4%) that recurred
and in 5 of 151 cases (3.3%) that did not recur. None of the patients
with detectable ctDNA postoperatively had elevated CEA. The rela-
tionships between postoperative ctDNA, postoperative CEA, and re-
currence status are shown in table S1.
Patients with ctDNA-positive status postoperatively had a marked-
ly reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to those with a

 ctDNA-negative status [HR, 18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.9 to
40; P = 2.6 × 10−12] (Fig. 2A). Kaplan-Meier estimates of RFS at 3 years
were 0% for the ctDNA-positive and 90% for the ctDNA-negative
groups. Patients with elevated CEA postoperatively had similar RFS
to those with nonelevated CEA (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.30 to 10; P = 0.5)
(fig. S1). Of the 40 patients with dMMR tumors, only 1 patient had
positive ctDNA postoperatively. This patient did not receive adjuvant
therapy and remains recurrence-free at 12 months.
Clinicopathologic variables significantly associated with RFS in uni-
variate analysis were T stage, LN yield, and LVI (Table 3). A borderline
association was seen for MMR status (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.86 to 15; P =
0.08). When considering all pathological factors, patients with high
clinicopathologic risk had a worse RFS than patients with low clinico-
pathologic risk (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 7.0; P = 0.002) (Fig. 2B). Post-
operative ctDNA status had a greater impact on RFS than any individual
clinicopathological risk factor or any combination of clinicopathologi-
cal factors. Postoperative ctDNA status added significant prognostic
value to patients classified as either low-risk or high-risk on the basis
of clinicopathological factors (low-risk: HR, 28; 95% CI, 8.1 to 93; P =
9.2 × 10−8; Fig. 2C; high-risk: HR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 22; P = 0.0002;
Fig. 2D). After multivariable adjustment, postoperative ctDNA status
remained an independent predictor of RFS for patients not treated
with chemotherapy (HR, 28; 95% CI, 11 to 68) (Table 3) and for all
patients (HR, 14; 95% CI, 6.8 to 28) (Table 3).
The time-dependent accuracy of postoperative ctDNA in predicting
radiologic recurrence at 5, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 40 months, as assessed by
time-dependent receiver operating curves (ROC) analysis, is shown in
table S2. The sensitivity and specificity of postoperative ctDNA in pre-
dicting recurrence at 36 months were 48 and 100%, respectively.

with adjuvant chemotherapy

 was positive in the postoperative period in 6 of 52 (11%) patients who
then received at least 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Serial
ctDNA concentrations for these patients are shown in Fig. 3 (A to
F). The ctDNA status changed from positive to negative during the
initial adjuvant treatment phase in five patients (patients A to E).
ctDNA became positive again after completion of chemotherapy in
two patients (patients A and B), both of whom later recurred radiolo-
gically. In the other three patients, ctDNA remained negative after
treatment. Two (patients C and D) of these remained recurrence-free
at 16 and 34 months. Patient E had radiologic recurrence despite the
ctDNA remaining negative, although CEA was elevated at the later
time point. ctDNA status for patient F fluctuated over time with no
detectable radiologic recurrence at 33 months. Overall, ctDNA posi-
tivity immediately after completion of chemotherapy was associated
with poorer RFS (HR, 11; 95% CI, 1.8 to 68; P = 0.001) (Fig. 3G).
Eight patients did not have blood samples collected after the comple-
tion of chemotherapy and were excluded from this analysis.
Serial ctDNA and CEA measurements during follow-up
We examined the sensitivity of serial ctDNA analysis during the follow-
up period to predict subsequent radiologic recurrence. Serial three-
monthly ctDNA and CEA values up to
radiologic recurrence were available for
27 of 34 patients who had recurred.
Samples were not collected at the time
of recurrence in seven patients primarily
because of individual patients’ decisions.
Serial ctDNA up to radiologic recurrence
was available from 9 of the 11 patients
with positive postoperative ctDNA who
were not treated with chemotherapy. Serial
ctDNA concentrations (MAFs) up to radi-
ologic recurrence from these patients are
illustrated in Fig. 4A. Serial circulating bio-
marker status and clinical characteristics at
radiologic recurrence of patients treated or
not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
are detailed in tables S3 and S4, respective-
ly. ctDNA was more frequently positive
(23 of 27) than CEA elevation (11 of 27)
at the time of radiologic recurrence (85%
versus 41%; P = 0.002). The time between
ctDNA detection and radiologic recurrence
(median, 167 days; IQR, 81 to 279 days)
was significantly longer than the time be-
tween CEA elevation and radiologic recur-
rence (median, 61 days; IQR, 0 to 207 days;
P = 0.04) (Fig. 4B). The genomic and
clinical summaries of all 230 cases in-
cluded in the final evaluable population
are provided in table S5.
DISCUSSION
The decision to treat or not to treat a stage
II colon cancer patient with adjuvant
chemotherapy remains one of the most
challenging areas in colorectal oncology. Currently, up to 40% of stage
II patients undergo adjuvant therapy in routine clinical care (34), com-
mitting to 6 months of chemotherapy, with the associated risk of po-
tentially serious adverse events and without a method to monitor the
impact of adjuvant therapy, for an absolute risk reduction of 3 to 5%.
Although multiple clinicopathological markers are now validated
and can be combined to define low- and high-risk groups, only a
minority of defined high-risk patients will develop recurrence. The
benefit of selectively treating these patients with adjuvant therapy
also remains to be conclusively proven. Diagnostic approaches that
better predict the disease course in this patient population are
therefore urgently required.
Here, we have taken a fundamentally different approach to address
these issues. We examine postoperative blood samples to identify di-
rect evidence of residual disease in the form of ctDNA that is released
into the circulation from cancer cells still present in the patient after
surgery but not detectable on imaging. Whereas histopathologic or
molecular characteristics of tumors that are associated with a higher
recurrence risk indicate a propensity for metastasis, the presence of
circulating DNA molecules containing somatic mutations found in
an individual’s tumor is a direct indication that occult tumor cells

tumor differentiation. The low-risk group is defined as those with no poor prognostic features.

 remain after surgery. ctDNA measurements should therefore be
considered not as a conventional biomarker of recurrence risk but
more like a staging test such as a CT scan. As with a CT scan, which
can only demonstrate residual disease when a sufficient tumor bulk is
present, ctDNA is not a perfect indicator of residual disease: with a
single plasma sample taken during the immediate postoperative peri-
od, its sensitivity for predicting recurrence at 36 months is 48%. How-
ever, these data demonstrate that the amount of tumor bulk required
for ctDNA detection is lower than that for CT scan detection, with
ctDNA detection preceding radiologic recurrence in many cases. CT
scans have limited specificity, whereas the very high specificity of
ctDNA was confirmed in the current study: 97% of patients whose
tumors did not recur during the course of the study had negative
ctDNA postoperatively, and in the few ctDNA-positive patients with-
out known radiologic recurrence, late recurrence remains a possibility.
Our study has demonstrated that stage II colon cancer patients
who were ctDNA-positive postoperatively are at extremely high risk
of radiologic recurrence (HR, 18; 95% CI, 7.9 to 40; P = 2.6 × 10−12)
when not treated with chemotherapy. This risk is greater than that in
patients with stage III colorectal cancer, who are routinely treated with
adjuvant therapy. Conversely, patients with negative ctDNA postop-
eratively were at a low risk of radiologic recurrence (3-year RFS of 90%),
not dissimilar to patients with stage I colorectal cancer (35), defining a
group where adjuvant therapy is less likely to be helpful. As expected,
when we stratified patients into clinicopathological low- and high-risk
groups, we found that patients with low risk had a significantly better
RFS than patients with high-risk features (P = 0.002). The prognostic
impact of postoperative ctDNA status was independent of individual
clinicopathological risk features and improved the RFS risk estimates
for both patients with clinicopathologic low (HR, 28; 95% CI, 8.1 to 93)
and high-risk features (HR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 22).
Our study also demonstrated that being ctDNA-positive at the
completion of adjuvant chemotherapy treatment predicted a very high
risk of radiologic recurrence. Of particular interest are the serial sam-
ples from patients who were ctDNA-positive postoperatively, then were
treated with chemotherapy on the basis of the clinician’s judgment (in

 the absence of knowledge of the ctDNA
results). These data suggest the possibility
that personalized serial measurement of
ctDNA could be a real-time marker of
adjuvant therapy impact. For example,
patients C and D were ctDNA-positive
postoperatively, indicating that they had
residual disease. Once treated with chemo-
therapy, their ctDNA became negative and
remained so, even after treatment was dis-
continued. Adjuvant therapy appeared to
have an effect on the disease in these pa-
tients, and this effect persisted for at least
16 to 34 months (last available follow-up).
For patients A and B, the chemotherapy
impact was transient in that ctDNA positiv-
ity, and later radiologic recurrence, was
observed after treatment was completed.
In contrast, a substantial fall in ctDNA
concentration in the months after surgery
was not observed in serial samples from
the nine patients with positive postopera-
tive ctDNA who did not receive chemo-
therapy. Although the finding from this
small number of cases is promising, the
use of serial ctDNA analysis for providing
an early readout of the benefit of adjuvant
chemotherapy needs to be validated in a
larger cohort of patients.
During surveillance, serial ctDNA mea-
surements appear to be more sensitive than
CEA measurement, the current standard-
of-care blood test, for predicting radiologic
recurrence. Because clinicians were blinded
to the ctDNA results but not to the CEA
results, a direct comparison between CEA
and ctDNA cannot be made. Nevertheless,
85% of patients were ctDNA-positive up
to or at the time of radiologic recurrence,
whereas CEA was only elevated in 41%
of patients. The median lead time from
ctDNA detection to radiological recurrence
was over 5 months, which might be suffi-
cient to change patient management. Com-
bining radiologic and ctDNA assessments
could result in earlier detection of recurrent
disease, potentially identifying more pa-
tients eligible for curative surgical resec-
tion or earlier implementation of systemic
therapies. One of the fundamental princi-
ples of oncology is that it is easier to cure
a small volume of metastatic disease than
a large volume (36).
In addition to improving patient se-
lection for adjuvant chemotherapy in
the routine clinical practice setting, the
inclusion of serial ctDNA analysis as a
biomarker in clinical trials is attractive.

 Enrolling only patients with detectable ctDNA into studies would
mean that trial cohorts would be enriched with patients at very high
risk of recurrence. This would substantially reduce the sample size re-
quired to demonstrate significant differences in outcomes given the
very high event rate and would substantially reduce the associated ex-
pense of treating and following up many hundreds of patients. Fur-
ther, not enrolling patients with undetectable ctDNA would mean that
very low risk patients who are relatively unlikely to benefit from ad-
juvant therapy would not be exposed to unnecessary treatment-related
risks. If serial ctDNA analysis proves to be a reliable marker of treat-
ment effect, we would also have an early readout of treatment efficacy,
meaning that clinical trials could be completed far more efficiently.
Despite the relatively large number of patients in our study, our
conclusions are limited by the small number of patients with detect-
able ctDNA postoperatively. This limits the power to detect statistical-
ly significant associations between postoperative ctDNA status and
conventional high-risk clinicopathological factors. However, our data
suggest that there are no large differences in clinicopathological char-
acteristics between the postoperative ctDNA-positive and ctDNA-
negative patients. The relatively small number of patients with detectable
ctDNA also makes the study susceptible to inherent biases, which may
limit the generalizability of our findings. Notwithstanding this, our
finding that postoperative ctDNA is a robust predictor of disease recur-
rence is consistent with recent reports in other tumor types. In a pros-
pective cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients, ctDNA was detectable
2 to 4 weeks after apparently curative surgery in 7 of 37 (19%) patients
and was predictive of early cancer relapse (HR, 25; 95% CI, 4.1 to 130)
(31). In a study of early-stage pancreatic cancer, ctDNA was detectable
postoperatively in 10 of 20 (50%) patients (32). Patients with de-
tectable ctDNA after surgical resection were more likely to relapse
compared with those with undetectable ctDNA (median time to re-
currence, 9.9 months versus not reached; P = 0.02). Finally, only
one mutation identified in each patient’s tumor tissue was analyzed
in our study, yielding a sensitivity of 48% in detecting residual disease
and predicting recurrence. The analytical sensitivity of ctDNA detec-
tion could potentially be improved by interrogating multiple mutations in
a single assay rather than analyzing one mutation per patient, as recently
demonstrated by Newman et al. (37).
In summary, this prospective study of stage II colon cancer pa-
tients demonstrated that ctDNA analysis of blood samples taken post-
operatively defines a population at very high risk of recurrence. This
ctDNA measurement is superior to clinicopathological measures cur-
rently used to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions. In the small
number of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, our data
highlight the potential utility of biomarkers for tracking adjuvant
chemotherapy effectiveness in real time, with implications for modify-
ing or changing therapeutic management before the advent of bulky
disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This prospective multicenter study recruited patients with stage II colon
cancer resected with curative intent at 13 Australian hospitals (Australian
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number ACTRN12612000326897).
The overall sample size was driven by the need to include a sufficient
number of events, with the expectation that about 35 of 250 unselected
patients with stage II colon cancer would experience recurrence in the
first three years. The study was approved by the human research ethics
committees at each hospital, and all participants provided written
informed consent. Eligible patients had a staging CT chest/abdomen/
pelvis within 12 weeks of study entry to exclude metastatic disease. Pa-
tients with a previous malignancy within the last 5 years were excluded.
Blood samples for ctDNA and CEA analysis were collected at 4 to
10 weeks postoperatively, with serial three-monthly blood samples
collected for up to 2 years from a subset of patients. The use of adjuvant
chemotherapy was at the discretion of the treating clinician, who was
blinded to the ctDNA result.
Per-protocol follow-up included three-monthly clinical review and
CEA, with six-monthly CT imaging for 2 years. Thereafter, follow-up
was according to the participating institutions’ standard of care. Serum
CEA was measured by the diagnostic laboratory at each participating site,
with CEA concentrations of <5 mg/liter considered normal. All plasma and
tumor samples were analyzed at the Ludwig Center at Johns Hopkins.
Pathology
Pathology reports were reviewed for tumor site, LN yield, tumor dif-
ferentiation, T stage, and LVI. MMR status was assessed by immuno-
histochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 proteins using
standard protocols (38). Tumors showing loss of expression in one or
more of the proteins were considered MMR-deficient.
We defined a clinicopathologic high-risk group using standard crite-
ria, including pMMR tumors with at least one of the following poor prog-
nostic features: T4, LN yield <12, LVI, and poor tumor differentiation.
The low-risk group consisted of patients with dMMR tumors or
pMMR tumors with no poor prognostic features.
Identification of somatic mutations in tumor tissue
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor sections were macro-
dissected under a dissecting microscope to ensure a neoplastic cellularity
of >30%. DNA was purified with a Qiagen FFPE Kit (Qiagen cat. no.
56494). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify regions
of 15 genes recurrently mutated in colorectal cancer (table S6). Primers
were designed and sequencing results were analyzed as previously de-
scribed (25, 26, 39).
ctDNA analysis
When more than one somatic mutation was identified in a patient’s
tumor tissue, the mutation with the highest MAF relative to the MAF
in normal control DNA was selected for ctDNA analysis. For each
patient, only one mutation identified in the tumor tissue was assessed
in the plasma.
Plasma (10 ml) was purified from each patient using the QIAamp
Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen cat. no. 55114). To distinguish
genuine mutations in the samples from artifactual variants arising
from sequencing and sample preparation steps, we used Safe-SeqS,
an error reduction technology for detection of low-frequency mutations
(33). In the Safe-SeqS assay, plasma DNA was aliquoted into 24 wells of
a 96-well plate so that an average of 0.5 to 3 ng of DNA was contained
in each well. The DNA from each well was then amplified (15 cycles)
using primers containing unique identifier sequences (UIDs), which
consisted of 14 random bases with an equal probability of A, C, T,
and G, to allow for the distinction of each template molecule. The am-
plified reactions were purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter)
and eluted in 250 ml of Buffer EB (Qiagen). One percent (2.5 ml) of

 purified PCR product was then amplified in a second round of PCR
with universal primers, as previously described (33). The PCR products
were purified with AMPure and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq
instrument.
High-quality sequence reads were selected on the basis of quality
scores, which were generated by the Illumina sequencing instrument
to indicate the probability that an error was made in base calling. The
template-specific portion of the reads was matched to reference se-
quences. Reads from a common template molecule were then grouped
on the basis of the UIDs that were incorporated as molecular barcodes.
Artifactual mutations introduced during the sample preparation or se-
quencing steps were reduced by requiring a mutation to be present in
>90% of reads in a UID family in order for that UID to be scored as a
“supermutant.” Wells with fewer than 200 UIDs as a result of poor am-
plification were excluded. DNA from the peripheral blood lymphocytes
of healthy individuals was used as a control in each experiment to iden-
tify potential false-positive mutations.
Algorithm for classifying ctDNA status
ctDNA was classified as detectable (ctDNA-positive) or undetectable
(ctDNA-negative) on the basis of a permutation test that compared the
mutation frequency in the sample of interest with the mutation frequen-
cies in controls. First, the MAF, defined as the ratio between the number
of supermutants and the number of UIDs for the mutation of interest,
was calculated for each well with >200 UIDs. The difference in the dis-
tributions of the MAFs between the sample of interest and the controls
was then statistically evaluated with the permutation test, using the
permTS function of the R package perm (R software version 3.2.3).
The one-sided test was used to avoid attributing significance to a
ctDNA-negative sample that has fewer supermutants than the asso-
ciated control. A 0.1 P value was then chosen as the threshold to classify
a sample of interest as ctDNA-positive (P < 0.1) or ctDNA-negative.
Given the lack of a gold standard, a specificity of at least 0.90 was
considered desirable, and a P value equal to 0.1 yielded 0.90 specificity
when performing leave-one-out cross-validation on the controls.
The controls with the highest MAF (upper tail of the MAF distribution
among controls) would inevitably be classified as positive by this permuta-
tion test in a leave-one-out cross-validation performed over all controls.
The actual specificity realized in our experiments with patients is there-
fore expected to be higher than the 90% estimated from the control
samples. Among patients not treated with chemotherapy, there were only
3 cases out of 178 with ctDNA detection and no recurrence, yielding a
specificity of ~98% [false-positive rate (FPR), 2%]. Furthermore, the clas-
sification algorithm is based on testing differences in MAF distributions.
It is therefore expected that a false positive is more likely in cases with low
ctDNA concentrations, such as those shown in Fig. 3 (D and F).
The availability of multiple samples (n) from the same patients in-
creases the probability of observing at least one false positive. Specifically,
this probability is given by 1-P0, where P0 is the probability of 0 successes
in a binomial with parameters n and p, with p being the FPR. At the
same time, with multiple time points, the probability that a false positive
will occur more than once in the same patient is 1-P0-P1, which is
smaller than an FPR of 2% when n < 11. Thus, assessing multiple sequen-
tial samples from the same patient can increase the overall specificity.
Statistical analysis
A preplanned analysis was conducted when 32 (90%) of the predicted
events had occurred. The primary outcome measure was RFS assessed
by standard radiologic criteria. RFS was measured from date of sur-
gery to documented first radiologic recurrence or death as a result of
colorectal cancer and was censored at last follow-up or non–colorectal
cancer–related death. Multivariate analysis was performed with man-
ual backward stepwise Cox regression modeling considering T stage,
postoperative ctDNA status, LN yield, LVI, and MMR status. T stage
and postoperative ctDNA were the only independent variables in-
cluded in the final model used to estimate the probability of RFS over
time. Data on LVI were not available from nine cases. We used
multiple imputation (Stata version 12.1) to handle subjects with
missing data. We used a previously described time-dependent ROC
analysis (40) performed with the R package survivalROC (version
1.0.3) to assess the time-dependent accuracy of postoperative ctDNA
in predicting recurrence at 5, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 40 months. We com-
pared two groups using the c2 or Fisher’s exact test for categorical varia-
bles and the Mann-Whitney (rank-sum) test for continuous variables.
Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp
LP) and GraphPad Prism version 6.07 (GraphPad Software Inc.), where
P values <0.05 were considered significant.
