IMPORTANCE The results of preclinical studies suggest that anesthetic drugs administered to
neonatal animals cause widespread neuronal apoptosis and later neurocognitive impairment.
Adequately powered studies in the pediatric surgical population are scarce, and it is unclear
whether such preclinical findings are relevant for the pediatric setting.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of anesthesia and surgery before age 4 years with
long-term academic and cognitive performance indexed by school grades at age 16 years and
IQ test scores at military conscription.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a cohort study among all children
born in Sweden between January 1973 and December 1993. The dates of analysis were April
2013 to October 2015. Among all 2 174 073 Swedish children born between 1973 and 1993,
we identified a primary study cohort of 33 514 children with 1 anesthesia and surgery
exposure before age 4 years and no subsequent hospitalization and 159 619 matched
unexposed control children. In addition, 3640 children with multiple surgical procedures
before age 4 years were studied.
EXPOSURE Having at least 1 surgical procedure in the Swedish Patient Register before
age 4 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The mean school grades at age 16 years and IQ test scores
at military conscription at age 18 years. The mean difference between the exposed cohort
and unexposed cohort was estimated in a model that included sex, month of birth during the
same year, gestational age at delivery, Apgar score at 5 minutes, maternal and paternal
educational levels, annual taxable household income, cohabiting parents, and number
of siblings.
RESULTS Among 33 514 exposed children (22 484 male and 11 030 female) and 159 619
unexposed children (105 812 male and 53 807 female) in the primary study cohort, 1 exposure
before age 4 years was associated with a mean difference of 0.41% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.70%)
lower school grades and 0.97% (95% CI, 0.15%-1.78%) lower IQ test scores. The magnitude
of the difference was the same after multiple exposures. There was no difference in school
grades with 1 exposure before ages 6 months, 7 to 12 months, 13 to 24 months, or 25 to 36
months. The overall difference was markedly less than the differences associated with sex,
maternal educational level, or month of birth during the same year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exposure to anesthesia and surgery before age 4 years has a
small association with later academic performance or cognitive performance in adolescence
on a population level. While more vulnerable subgroups of children may exist, the low overall
difference in academic performance after childhood exposure to surgery is reassuring. These
findings should be interpreted in light of potential adverse effects of postponing surgery.

T
here is global concern regarding the effect of exposure
to anesthesia and surgery during early life and the risk
for later neurocognitive deficits and impaired school
achievements.1,2Afterpioneeringstudies3,4inrodents,itisnow
established that exposure to commonly used anesthetics dur-
ingcriticaltimepointsintheneonatalperiodconsistentlyleads
to structural, functional, and later behavioral deficits in ani-
mals ranging from nematodes to primates.4-11 Such anes-
thetic neurotoxicity, typically seen as apoptosis, cell death, re-
duced synaptic sprouting, and impaired neurogenesis, is
affected by age and the cumulative dose of anesthetics and has
been demonstrated in rodents and primates for an array of
anesthetic agents.12-14
The findings in neonatal animal models have triggered a
series of epidemiological studies15-26 focusing on long-term
cognitive development in young children undergoing anes-
thesia and surgery. While retrospective investigations have
failed to identify an association with later academic perfor-
mance after 1 exposure to anesthesia and surgery, multiple ex-
posures are consistently associated with an increased risk for
learning or cognitive disabilities.17,18,24 Reasons for these di-
vergent results have been proposed,1,2,27,28 including con-
founding by indication and the effect of comorbidities driven
bytheunderlyingdisorder.Nevertheless,amajorchallengehas
been to obtain a large enough sample size to provide ad-
equate statistical power and a sensitive and uniformly ap-
pliedoutcomemeasureofneurocognitivedevelopmentoraca-
demic performance to detect long-term neurocognitive
outcomes or impaired academic outcomes among children
exposed to surgery in early life.
A recent clinical study29 comparing children having 1 ex-
posure to general anesthesia before age 36 months with unex-
posed siblings found no difference in IQ in later childhood. An-
otherstudy30comparingtheriskforcognitivedeclineinchildren
exposed to either sevoflurane anesthesia or regional anesthe-
sia while awake failed to identify any increased risk for nega-
tive cognitive outcomes associated with a cognitive test bat-
tery 2 years after surgery for hernia repair. On the other hand,
while awaiting 5-year follow-up data on that study and other
ongoing prospective trials,31 health care professionals and par-
ents are left with uncertainty as to whether early exposure to
anesthesia and surgery per se leads to later behavioral deficits
or poor academic achievements (http://www.smarttots.org).32
We undertook a nationwide cohort study of more than 2
million children born in Sweden between January 1973 and
December 1993, combining an array of national health care da-
tabases,registriesofschoolachievements,andthemilitarycon-
scription register with information on verbal and spatial cog-
nitive testing. The dates of analysis were April 2013 to October
2015. Our objective was to examine the association of anes-
thesia and surgery before age 4 years with long-term
academic and cognitive performance in adolescence.
Methods
The study was approved by the regional ethical review board
in Stockholm, Sweden. Because this study was based on sec-
ondary analysis of national registry data, this approval did not
require any informed consent. Information was retrieved and
cross-linked from 8 different registers as described in eTable
1 in the Supplement.
Surgery Cohorts
Among all 2 174 073 children born in Sweden between 1973 and
1993, the exposed surgery cohort comprised all 121 498 chil-
dren who had any hospital admission for surgery before age 4
years. Exposed and unexposed children were identified by
cross-linking the Swedish Medical Birth Register with the
Swedish Patient Register, both administered by the National
Board of Health and Welfare in Stockholm (http://www
.socialstyrelsen.se). In 1973, the Swedish Patient Register
included counties covering 80% of the Swedish population,
and complete coverage was reached in 1987. As a consequence,
exposure status for children born in counties without coverage
between 1973 and 1986 could not be ascertained and was
excluded. Children migrating to counties without register
coverage and children who died or emigrated before obtaining
theirfinalschoolgradesatage16yearswereexcluded(Figure1).
Premature children were not excluded; however, for all
outcomes, the estimated difference between exposed and
unexposedchildrenwasadjustedforgestationalageatdelivery.
The remaining exposed children were classified accord-
ing to 14 groups of surgical procedures (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). Children deemed to have a high risk of residual cogni-
tive impairment because of the reason for surgery or the
procedure per se, such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic sur-
gery, or cancer surgery, were excluded, leaving 8 types of sur-
gery for analysis. In addition, children with predefined diag-
noses occurring up to age 16 years (eg, serious malformation
or cancer disorders without surgery) were excluded (Figure 1
and eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The primary cohort (n = 33 514) was defined as children
having 1 anesthesia and surgery exposure before age 4 years
andnosubsequentsurgeryorhospitalizationuntilage16years.
A secondary cohort included the children with multiple sur-
gical procedures before age 4 years (n = 3640). A tertiary co-
hort also included the children with in-hospital care from ages
4 to 16 years (Figure 1 and eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Key Points
Question Does exposure to anesthesia and surgery during early
childhood affect academic and cognitive performance in
adolescence?
Findings In this cohort study among 33 514 exposed children,
exposure to surgery with anesthesia before age 4 years was
associated with 0.41% lower school grades and 0.97% lower IQ
test scores, with no difference in school grades with regard to age.
The overall difference was markedly less than the differences
associated with sex, maternal educational level, or month of birth
during the same year.
Meaning Exposure to anesthesia and surgery before age 4 years
has a small association with later academic performance or
cognitive performance in adolescence on a population level.

Control Cohort
For each individual in the surgery cohorts, 5 control children
having no surgery or hospitalization before age 16 years were
selectedfromtheSwedishMedicalBirthRegister.Controlswere
matched for sex, month of birth during the same year, and
maternal parity and county of residence at delivery.
Outcomes
The primary outcome variables were academic performance
based on school grades at age 16 years and general intelli-
gence test scores. School grades were retrieved from the Swed-
ish Ninth Grade Register, which only includes children receiv-
ing grades after completing 9 years in the regular schooling
system and does not include information on children in need
of special education because of severe disabilities. There-
fore, study individuals having no recorded school grades are
those leaving the regular schooling system or those never
entering this system because of severe disabilities.
School grades are based on a uniform school curriculum
and academic performance evaluation system for all schools
and students throughout Sweden, calibrated annually by a
compulsory nationwide individual-level test in mathemat-
ics, Swedish, and English. Children in Sweden start school in
the fall the year they become 7 years old. The 3 academic per-
formance outcomes were the mean school grades, grades be-
low the 10th percentile of the matched control group, or no re-
cordedschoolgrades.Twodifferentgradingsystemswereused
duringthestudyperiod,onewiththemeanschoolgradesrang-
ing from 1 to 5 for children born between 1973 and 1981 and
the other with the mean school grades ranging from 0 to 320

Statistical Analysis
Analysisofvariancewasusedtotesteffectsonthemeanschool
grades and was performed separately for the 2 grading sys-
tems. The mean difference between the exposed cohort and
unexposed cohort was estimated in a model that included sex,
month of birth during the same year, gestational age at deliv-
ery, Apgar score at 5 minutes, maternal and paternal educa-
tionallevels,annualtaxablehouseholdincome,cohabitingpar-
ents, and number of siblings. All variables were categorized as
listed in the Table (including children hospitalized between
ages 4 and 16 years) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Details are
given in eMethods 2 in the Supplement.
The adjusted mean differences between the exposed and
unexposed cohorts for the 2 grading systems were normal-
ized by the mean school grade in the unexposed cohort in each
grading system (3.21 and 205.22, respectively), and a pooled
estimate was obtained by weighting with the reciprocal vari-
ance using the following equation:

Therefore, the surgery effect was estimated as percentage unit
change in reference to the mean school grade. Heterogeneity
in the normalized difference between the 2 systems was tested
by a z test.
The IQ test scores at military conscription were
analyzed in the same manner as the school grades. To
facilitate comparisons with analyses of school grades, the
difference between the exposed and unexposed cohorts was
normalized by the mean test result in the unexposed
cohort.
The risks of having grades below the 10th percentile, no
recorded school grades, and no available cognitive test
scores were analyzed by logistic regression with the same
covariates as in the analysis of the mean school grades. The
results from these analyses are presented as odds ratios
with 95% CIs. Homogeneity of surgery effects with respect
to the type of surgery, age at first surgery, and number of
surgical procedures and sex, maternal educational level,
and annual taxable household income was tested by
χ2 tests. Analyses were performed using a statistical
software program (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Academic Performance
Among 33 514 exposed children and 159 619 unexposed chil-
dren in the primary study cohort, the data revealed a mean dif-
ference of 0.41% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.70%) lower school grades
for 1 exposure before age 4 years. There was no difference in
school grades with 1 exposure before age 6 months, between
7 to 12 months, between 13 to 24 months, or between 25 to 36
months (Figure 2). Despite no overall heterogeneity with re-
spect to age at surgery, a small difference of 0.79%, (95% CI,
0.25%-1.33%) in academic performance was detected in chil-
dren exposed at ages 37 to 48 months, which thus contrib-
uted to the overall association before age 4 years. The differ-
ence in the mean school grades associated with 1 exposure was
several orders of magnitude less than the mean difference as-
sociated with sex, maternal educational level, and month of
birth during the same year.
Significant heterogeneity between the different types of
surgerywasdetected.Thisfindingwasmainlyduetothe1.22%

0.93% higher grades in the urological surgery subgroup
(Figure 2).
Therewasnoassociationbetweenhavinggradesbelowthe
10th percentile and exposure (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98-
1.07) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). This risk was not modi-
fied by lower maternal educational level or lower socio-
economic status (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Amongtheexposedchildren,2.0%hadnorecordedschool
grades at age 16 years compared with 1.6% among the control
children. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.17-1.42).
This association was significantly modified by the type of sur-
gery, with the paracentesis, orthopedic surgery, and ear, nose,
and throat subgroups having a higher probability of no re-
cordedschoolgradesthanthoseundergoingothertypesofsur-
gery (Figure 3). The odds ratios for having no recorded school
grades were not significantly different with respect to age at
first surgery or the number of surgical procedures (Figure 3).
The secondary cohort, which included children with mul-
tiple surgical procedures before age 4 years (ie, those ex-
posed on 2 occasions [n = 2841] or ≥3 occasions [n = 799]), had
1.41% and 1.82% lower mean school grades, respectively
(Figure 2). Heterogeneity with respect to the number of
surgical procedures was statistically significant.
In the above analyses, exposed children and unexposed
controls who were hospitalized between ages 4 and 16 years
were excluded, assuming that the potential effect of anesthe-
sia on cognitive function does not affect future hospitaliza-
tion. However, there was an association between surgery at a
young age and future hospitalization, with 18.3% of the ex-
posed children hospitalized between ages 4 and 7 years com-
pared with 12.5% of the controls. The corresponding propor-
tionsofhospitalizedchildrenbetweenages8and16yearswere
27.0% among exposed children and 22.9% among unexposed
children (eTable 4 in the Supplement). When children hospi-
talized after age 4 years also were included, the exposed chil-
dren had 0.87% (95% CI, 0.64%-1.11%) lower mean school
grades, and the odds ratios for having grades below the 10th
percentile and for having no recorded school grades were 1.09
(95% CI, 1.05-1.12) and 1.31 (95% CI, 1.23-1.40), respectively
(eFigure 1 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

affect later academic performance are shown in Figure 4.

these variables (sex, maternal educational level, and month
of birth during the same year) was several orders of magni-
tude greater than the mean difference associated with expo-
sure to anesthesia and surgery before age 4 years.
IQ Test Scores From the National Military
Conscription Review Process
The IQ test scores from the military conscription review were
obtained from 9198 exposed boys and 45 115 unexposed boys
(eTable 6 in the Supplement). The mean IQ test scores among
boys with 1 exposure before age 4 years (normalized by the
mean IQ test score in the unexposed cohort) were 0.97% (95%
CI, 0.15%-1.78%) lower than the scores among unexposed boys
(Figure 5). The fraction of boys without IQ test scores was
slightly higher among the exposed vs unexposed individuals
(odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15). The IQ test scores that in-
clude children having 1 or more hospitalizations between ages
4 and 16 years are shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement.
SchoolGradesMeasuredbytheOldandNewGradingSystems
The normalized difference between exposed and unexposed
children for the 2 grading systems was not statistically signifi-
cant for all surgical procedures as a group or for any proce-
dural subgroup. Details are given in eTable 7, eFigure 3, and
eMethods 2 in the Supplement.
Discussion
In this highly powered nationwide study, we found statisti-
cally significant but minimally lower school grades at age 16
years among children exposed to 1 surgical procedure with an-
esthesia before age 4 years. The association indicates a mean
reduction in the mean school grades of 0.41% (95% CI, 0.12%-
0.70%), which is at most less than 0.70% considering the 95%
CI. The magnitude of this reduction is markedly less than the
observed differences in school grades between children born
in January or December of the same year, between those born
to mothers with intermediate vs high educational levels, or be-
tween boys and girls. Because school grades may not fully re-
flect all aspects of cognitive function, we also investigated IQ
test scores in the subcohort of boys who were included in mili-
tary conscription at age 18 years. Boys who underwent 1 sur-
gical procedure before age 4 years had a 0.97% reduction in
the mean IQ test scores at conscription, confirming the small
extent of the exposure effect seen on school grades.
While there is evidence from experimental animal mod-
els that a single exposure to anesthetics for several hours in
the early postnatal period produces neuroapoptosis, im-
paired synaptic sprouting, and later neurocognitive deficits
over a wide range of species,4-6 recent findings after brief ex-
posures of less than 1 hour fail to demonstrate such effects.13
In rats, the most pronounced postexposure neuronal apopto-
sis is seen around postnatal day 7, corresponding to the most
intense period of synaptogenesis.14 Although these experi-
mental observations have fueled a general controversy of in-
creased vulnerability among children in the neonatal period
and before age 12 months, there was no reduction in school
grades among children with surgery before age 1 year in this
study. Because the observed effect was not significantly modi-
fied by age at surgery, our findings do not support hypoth-
eses that the youngest children would be more vulnerable.

It may be argued that that the measure of school grades at
age 16 years is insufficiently sensitive to detect an effect from
an intervention in early childhood. However, given the nation-
wideschoolcurriculum,combinedwithauniformschoolgrade
system, we were able to detect an effect even by month of birth
during the same year, which indicates that the outcome vari-
able is sensitive enough to detect a subtle association between
chronologicalageatschoolstartandschoolgradesatage16years
and that the school system per se is unable to fully compen-
sate a difference in cognitive function relating to age at school
start. Furthermore, the magnitude of the association was simi-
lartothatforcognitiveperformanceindexedbytheIQtestscores
during military conscription 2 years later.
The largest caveat with this investigation and similar
studies15-26 is the inability to disentangle the potential effects
of anesthesia per se, the influence of perioperative manage-
ment, and the possible sequelae of surgery (including the du-
ration of surgery per se) or its underlying cause. To reduce con-
founding by indication as much as possible, we excluded
surgical procedures associated with serious comorbidity and
successive contact with the health care system, such as neu-
rosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and cancer surgery. In spite
of this effort, we found differences between the types of sur-
gery,whichcouldreflectnotonlyassociationsbetweentheun-
derlying condition and future cognitive function but also dif-
ferences in the type and duration of anesthesia. It may be
argued that the lower school grades associated with ear, nose,
and throat surgery at ages 37 to 48 months could be due to con-
founding from hearing impairment or delayed speech
development,32 while reasons for higher school grades among
childrenwithurologicalproceduresseemmorespeculativeand
cannot be resolved by our data. Furthermore, we excluded all
children hospitalized between ages 4 to 16 years, thereby re-
ducing the potential effect of comorbidities relating to the in-
dication for surgery or its potential sequelae. As an illustra-
tionoftheeffectonthedatabyhospitalizationafterage4years,
the reduction in school grades was twice as high in the ex-
posed group when children with later hospitalizations were
included compared with the unexposed group.
Two previous studies22,23 have shown an increased prob-
ability of having no recorded school grades (nonattainment)
among children undergoing surgery at young ages (odds ra-
tios, 1.19 and 1.37, respectively), despite a lack of difference in
test results compared with unexposed controls. We also ob-
served an increased probability of nonattainment at age 16
years in the surgery group herein (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29).

We could not determine whether the reason for having no re-
corded school grades was because of leaving the school sys-
tem early or never entering the regular school system, a limi-
tation of the present study. However, because the association
betweenexposureandschoolgradesinthe10thpercentilewas
weak, it seems unlikely that the relationship with nonattain-
mentreflectsadramaticeffectofanesthesiaandsurgeryinpar-
ticularly sensitive individuals.
Several studies16-18 have confirmed an association be-
tween multiple exposures to anesthesia and surgery and later
learning disabilities and poor academic performance. Wilder
et al18 found learning disabilities among 144 children having
2 or more procedures with anesthesia but not among 449 chil-
dren having a single procedure. We also observed a larger re-
duction in the mean school grades with increasing numbers
of surgical procedures. Even with exposure to 3 or more sur-
gical procedures, the reduction is small compared with the dif-
ference in grades between children born in January or Decem-
ber of the same year. While this observation may reflect a dose
response with respect to the exposure, the risk of confound-
ing by indication is also likely to increase with increasing num-
bersofsurgicalprocedures.Anotherlimitationisthatthisstudy
lacked any data on the duration of surgery, although histori-
cal data indicate that it was unlikely to exceed 60 minutes
(eMethods 2 in the Supplement).
Conclusions
Exposure to anesthesia and surgery before age 4 years is as-
sociated with a small difference in academic performance or
cognitive performance in adolescence on a population level.
