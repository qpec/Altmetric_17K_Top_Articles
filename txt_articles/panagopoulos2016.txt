Study Design. Systematic review
Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate whether
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings change over a
relatively short period of time (<1 yr) in people with low back
pain (LBP) or sciatica. We also investigated whether there was
an association between any change in MRI findings and change
in clinical outcomes.
Summary of Background Data. MRI offers the potential to
identify possible pathoanatomic sources of LBP and/or sciatica;
however, the clinical importance of MRI findings remains
unclear. Little is known about whether lumbar MRI findings
change over the short term and if so whether these changes are
associated with changes in clinical outcomes.
Methods. Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases were
searched. Included were cohort studies that performed repeat
MRI scans within 12 months in patients with LBP and/or
sciatica. Data on study characteristics and change in MRI
findings were extracted from included studies. Any data describ-
ing associations between change in MRI findings and change in
clinical outcomes were also extracted.
Results. A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and
were included in the review. Pooling was not possible due to
heterogeneity of studies and findings. Seven studies reported on
changes in disc herniation and reported 15% to 93% of
herniations reduced or disappeared in size. Two studies reported
on changes in nerve root compression and reported 17% to 91%
reduced or disappeared. Only one study reported on the
association between change in MRI findings and change in
clinical outcomes within 1 year, and found no association.
Conclusion. This review found moderate evidence that the
natural course of herniations and nerve root compression is
favorable over a 1-year period in people with sciatica or LBP.
There is a lack of evidence on whether other MRI findings
change, and whether changes in MRI findings are associated
with changes in clinical outcomes.

L
ow back pain (LBP) continues to be a leading cause of
disability and suffering globally.1 The vast majority of
LBP is classified as nonspecific LBP2 due to the diffi-
culties in confidently identifying the tissue or nociceptive
source of pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers
the potential to identify potential pathoanatomical contri-
butions to LBP.3 A number of MRI findings such as disc
herniations, Modic changes, annular tears, and spondylolis-
thesis have been suggested as possible nociceptive sources of
LBP. The involved structures are innervated and have been
shown to produce LBP when stimulated.4 Although some
MRI findings are common in asymptomatic people,5,6 recent
studies have demonstrated that MRI findings are substan-
tially more common in people with LBP.7,8 Little is known
about whether MRI findings change over a relatively short
period of time during an episode of LBP or sciatica.9 If lumbar
spine MRI findings are important contributors to LBP or
sciatica then it would seem reasonable that changes in MRI
findings should be identifiable during an episode of pain.
To adequately investigate changes in MRI findings, a
longitudinal investigation in which serial measures are taken

is required. Such studies may provide insight into the
importance of MRI findings, if they were associated with
changes in symptoms in patients with LBP or sciatica. For
example, it is of interest to know whether patients whose
disc herniations reduce in size improve more than patients
whose disc herniations worsen or remain similar. It is
currently unclear whether changes in MRI findings are
associated with changes in patients’ symptoms.
There are no published systematic reviews that have
described longitudinal changes for a range of MRI findings
over the short term in patients with LBP or sciatica. Hence
the current study aimed to answer the following questions:
(i) Do MRI findings change over a relatively short
period of time (�1 year) in patients with LBP and/
or sciatica?
(ii) Is there an association between any changes in MRI
findings and changes in clinical outcomes in patients
with LBP and/or sciatica over a relatively short period
(�1 year)?
METHODS
The review protocol was established prospectively and
registered
on
PROSPERO
under
registration
number
CRD42014012990
(http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPER
O/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42014012990).
Search Strategy
Studies were identified through searches of Medline,
EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from the earliest record
to October 2014. Searches contained terms for the three
domains of, LBP, MRI, and cohort studies. The search terms
used for LBP were those recommended by the Cochrane
Back Review Group.10 Search terms for LBP, MRI, and
cohort studies were combined using the AND operator to
create the final strategy (Medline search strategy is outlined
in Appendix 1, http://links.lww.com/BRS/B186).
Study Selection
For studies to be included they had to be cohort studies,
including randomised controlled trials, of participants with
current LBP/or sciatica, that reported on the same MRI
feature on at least two occasions, no more than 1 year apart.
Oneyearwaschosenbecausewewantedtofocusonrelatively
short-term changes more likely to be clinically important.11
To provide data for the second study aim, studies needed to
meet the criteria above and also provide data on a clinical
outcome in a manner that enabled the relationship between
change in MRI finding and change in clinical findings to be
assessed. Studies were excluded if there had been a surgical
intervention or if participants experienced specific diseases
such as cancer. If a randomized controlled trial, however,
presented data separately for a control group, which did not
have surgical intervention, then the study was included and
data from control participants extracted.
One author screened the titles to exclude clearly unre-
lated studies. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts
of all remaining studies. Finally, full-text articles were
independently reviewed by two authors. Any disagreements
were resolved by discussion.
Data Extraction
Data extraction was completed independently by two
authors. Study characteristics obtained from included stud-
ies were sample source, sample size, age, pain symptoms,
MRI findings, and MRI scoring method. For each MRI
finding reported we extracted values at baseline and at
available follow-up time points and used these to calculate
change values whenever sufficient raw data were available.
If studies provided data on the association between any
changes in MRI findings and changes in symptoms this was
also extracted to answer aim 2. Authors of studies were
contacted for further data when required.
Risk of Bias
The risk of bias of included studies was evaluated by two
authors. This was performed using a modification of criteria
previously described.11,12 Each study was rated as having
met or not met each bias domain according to the guidelines
outlined in the tool (see Appendix 2, http://links.lww.com/
BRS/B186). In studies in which there was uncertainty in a
category, the category was rated as unsure. Disagreements
were resolved through discussion between authors.
Analysis
We
assessed
the
homogeneity
of
participants,
MRI
findings, timing of repeat MRI, and clinical outcomes in
included studies to determine whether pooling of data and
meta-analysis were appropriate. When raw data were avail-
able we calculated the percentage change by dividing the
change scores by the number of MRI findings present at
baseline. Confidence intervals were then calculated for
percentage change.
RESULTS
Figure 1 summarizes the retrieval and processing of studies.
The initial electronic database search identified 9484 stud-
ies. After screening by title and abstract, 34 potential eligible
studies were identified and full articles retrieved. Of these 22
articles were excluded: six because they were not cohort
studies; two studies involved participants who were not
experiencing current LBP or sciatica; and 14 studies did
not report on the same MRI feature within 1 year. A total of
12 articles were included in the review.13–24
Risk of Bias
Table 1 provides details of risk of bias assessment for all
included studies. Overall, the risk of bias of the included
studies was relatively low. All studies defined the study
sample (100%). Four of the 12 studies (33%) described a
representative sample, whereas for 7 studies it was unclear
whether patients were randomly selected or consecutive
cases. Follow-up rates of more than 80% between MRI
scans occurred in five studies (42%). Only one study (8%)

explicitly defined the use of consistent follow-up time
points. Eleven studies (92%) had MRI scans reported on
by a blinded radiologist.
Study Characteristics
A detailed description of study characteristics is provided in
Table 2. The samples were recruited from university hos-
pitals,22,23 secondary spine centers,16,17,24–26 and primary
care.14,15,18,19 For two studies we used data from the control
arm of a randomized controlled study investigating surgical
intervention in LBP22 and sciatica.26 The studies generally
included middle-aged people and had a fairly neutral gender
bias. Only seven of the included studies provided infor-
mation on the treatments received by patients. Treatments
in these studies included physical therapy,13,16,17,22,27
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications,16,17,23 analge-
sia,13
antibiotics,24
cognitive
interventions,22
and
education.16,22,23 The majority of the studies had a repeat
MRI 12 months after the first MRI, although one study had
6-week repeat MRI,16 one study had 8-month repeat MRI,14

and another study had repeat MRI at 6 weeks and
6 months.17 The most common MRI findings reported on
were disc herniation (seven studies), Modic changes (MC)
(four studies), and nerve root compression (two studies).
Change in MRI Findings Up to 12 Months
The studies included in this review were deemed too hetero-
geneous in terms of MRI findings reported, population, and
follow-up time points to allow for pooling of findings. The
results are therefore presented descriptively grouped by MRI
finding (Table 3).
Disc Herniation
Seven studies investigated changes in disc herniation during
periods ranging from 6 weeks to 12 months (Table 3).13,15–
17,19,26,27 Four studies16,17,23,26 reported on the proportion
of disc herniations that disappeared at repeat MRI. These
studies reported that between 0% and 41% of herniations
disappeared at repeat MRI, with typically higher rates of
disappearance reported at longer follow-up times (Table 3).
Four studies reported on the proportion of disc herniations
that reduced or disappeared in size at repeat MRI.15,17,23,26
These studies reported that 15% to 93% of herniations
reduced in size or disappeared, with higher rates typically
reported at longer follow-up periods. One study reported on
the number of disc herniations that increased in size at
repeat MRI.15 The present study found that 10% of hernia-
tions increased in size at 6-month follow-up in patients with
LBP. Two studies reported on the proportion of disc seques-
tration that reduced or disappeared.17,23 Rates of disc
sequestration changes ranged from 0% to 63% for disap-
pearance
and
from
57%
to
100%
for
reduced
or disappeared.
Single studies reported on other measures of disc hernia-
tion change within 12 months. The findings are presented in
Table 3.
Nerve Root Compression
Two studies reported on the changes in nerve root com-
pression over periods ranging from 6 weeks to 12 months
(Table 3).16,26 One study26 reported on change in nerve root
compression and reported 90% disappeared or reduced and
60% completely disappeared at 12-month follow-up.
Modic et al16 reported 17% of LBP patients and 30% of
patients with sciatica showed reduction or disappearance of
nerve root compression during 6 weeks.
Modic Changes
Four studies investigated MC during periods ranging from 8
to 12 months (Table 3).14,18,21,24 The studies, however,
reported on different types of MC, and focused on different
outcomes such as change in size or change in type, making
comparison between studies very difficult. All four studies
reported on the proportion of MC that altered in size. Three
studies reported less than 10% of MC increased or
decreased in size, whereas one study reported that 85%
of MC type 1 altered in size during 12 months with 40%
increasing and 45% decreasing in size. Two studies reported
on changes in Modic type. One study reported that 21% of
MC converted type during 8 months in patients with LBP.

Another study reported that 63% of MC type 1 converted to
type 2 during 12 months in patients with LBP.
Association of Change in MRI Findings With Change
in Clinical Outcomes
No study reported adequate data enabling us to evaluate the
association between the change in MRI findings and the
change in clinical outcomes during 1 year in patients with
sciatica. Two studies13,26 reported findings that were close
to the data we required. One study had data for surgical and
nonsurgical patients combined26 and one study13 only
reported 2 year follow-ups for comparison between MRI
change and change in clinical outcomes. We contacted both
authors requesting the data needed for our study. el

Barzouhi et al19 provided the data separately for nonsurgi-
cally treated patients enabling the use of this data. The study
compared MRI findings to clinical outcomes at 1 year in
patients with sciatica. A favorable outcome was defined as
complete or near complete disappearance of symptoms on a
global perceived recovery scale. There was no statistical
difference (RR ¼ 1.05; 95% CI 0.76–1.44) in the pro-
portion of patients having a favorable or unfavorable
clinical outcome based on the change in disc herniations
over time. A favorable outcome was reported in 73% (95%
CI 57%–85%) of patients whose disc herniation disap-
peared, and in 88% (95% CI 77%–94%) of patients whose
disc herniations did not disappear. Similarly there was no
statistical difference (RR ¼ 1.01; 95% CI 0.84–1.23) in the
proportion of patients having a favorable or unfavorable
clinical outcome based on the change in nerve root com-
pression over time.
DISCUSSION
Statement of Principal Findings
The present study reveals that there is limited evidence
regarding changes in most MRI findings during the short
term in patients with LBP or sciatica. Of the 12 available
studies with a total of 901 participants, sample sizes in each
study were generally small (ranging from 11 to 246), and
studies reported different MRI findings, with most data on
disc herniations.
The proportion of MRI findings that changed varied
between the different MRI findings. Between 0% and
41% of herniations disappeared during the first year,
whereas 15% to 93% of herniations reduced in size. Disc
sequestrations showed higher rates of change, with 0% to
63% completely resolving, whereas 57% to 100% reduced
in size. Similar rates were reported for nerve root com-
pression with up to 90% reducing during 1 year; however,
only a small number of studies investigated short-term
change in this and other MRI findings. Only one included
study provided data on the association between change in
MRI findings and change in clinical outcomes. That study
found no association between change in disc herniations or
nerve root compressions with change in clinical outcome in
people with sciatica managed nonsurgically.
Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study
The strengths of this systematic review include the use of a
prespecified protocol and use of a highly sensitive search
strategy. We assessed risk of bias of included studies using
an appropriate modification of a previously reported tool
for prognosis studies.
The primary limitation of this systematic review is the
small number of included studies investigating change over
time of most MRI findings. With regards to our secondary
aim we were only able to provide data from a single study.
Therefore, these findings must be interpreted with caution.
We excluded studies in which participants had undergone

recent systematic review by Chiu et al27 investigated changes
in disc herniations during any follow-up time period. They
reported similar rates of reduction in disc sequestration
(91%) and herniation (41%). They also reported that dis-
appearance of disc herniations occurred in 43% of seques-
tered discs and 15% of extruded discs, which aligns with
proportions reported in our review. This raises the possib-
ility that most changes in disc herniations occur within 1
year. Of the nine studies they included four (44%) had
follow-up time periods that were longer than 12 months.
In addition, they only reported on disc herniation changes
and included studies which used MRI, computerized tom-
ography and myelography. Our review reported on a
broader range of MRI findings and did so in a follow-up
time period, which we believe is most clinically relevant.
Meaning of the Study
An understanding of how lumbar spine MRI findings
change in patients experiencing LBP or sciatica is crucial
for researchers and clinicians to better understand the
potential clinical importance of MRI findings. If lumbar
MRI findings do not change during 1 year after an episode of
LBP, then it is hard to understand how they can be import-
ant to the clinical course of pain, which usually changes
substantially during this period.28 Our review found that
some MRI findings do appear to change substantially (e.g.,
reduce in size or fully resolve) and therefore may be associ-
ated with changes in symptoms. Understanding how MRI
findings change, can be used to reassure patients and provide
a rationale for why their pain may be expected to reduce in
the future. Although this review, provides evidence of MRI
findings changing over time, it is unclear how these changes
relate to changes in clinical outcomes. In the one study in our
review that investigated this, there was no association
between change in MRI findings and change in pain. Under-
standing that some MRI findings typically resolve well,
during 1 year, provides clinicians with important infor-
mation that can be used to reassure patients. For patients
to understand that some MRI findings can improve or
resolve naturally can be useful information to facilitate
patient-centered, informed treatment decisions during the
course of an episode of LBP or sciatica. It is important to
acknowledge that, in some cases, MRI findings either do not
change or worsen over time and this may contribute to the
range of pain, disability, and functional loss experienced by
different patients.
Recommendations for Further Research
Large high-quality longitudinal studies are required to better
understand how different MRI findings change during an
episode of LBP and/or sciatica and also to determine
whether these changes contribute to changes in clinical
symptoms. Future studies should assess changes in MRI
findings and clinical outcomes in the period when symptoms
change most (3 months), and ensure use of standardized
methods to evaluate MRI findings and clinical outcomes. It
is important for future studies to investigate the change in
different MRI findings (e.g., disc herniation and spinal
stenosis) separately as both the proportion of change and
relation with back pain are likely to be different. It is also
important to investigate the relationship of the MRI findings
separately for LBP and radicular pain.
Key Points
There is a favorable natural course of disc
herniations and nerve root compressions during
1 year in people with LBP and/or sciatica.
There is little evidence to describe the natural
course of other MRI findings.
There is a lack of evidence on whether any
observed change in MRI findings is associated
with a change in clinical outcomes.
