Abstract
Purpose: To develop an approach for the investigation of
different subtypes of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and other cells
to evaluate their potential prognostic value of prostate cancer.
Experimental Design: Malignancy of CTCs undergoing epithe-
lial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was confirmed by repeated
FISH. Subgroups of CTCs in 81 patients with prostate cancer
(43 castration resistant and 38 untreated localized) were correlated
to disease aggressiveness parameters. AUC analysis was applied to
comparetheperformance for metastasis prediction betweenserum
PSA level alone and a combined risk score using both PSA and
EMTingCTC count. Circulatingmegakaryocytes and cancer patient
survival association was performed using Cox model.
Results: The majority of vimentin (VIM)þ/CD45� cells were
malignant, with genomic alterations in several genomic regions.
The number of cytokeratin (CK)�/VIMþ/CD45� CTCs correlated
with disease burden, tumor aggressiveness, and poorer survival.
Meanwhile, CKþ/VIMþ/CD45� CTCs were associated with metas-
tases better than other subtypes of CTCs in these limited samples.
Combination of PSA level and the number of CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�
CTCs enhanced the prediction of cancer metastases [AUC, 0.921;
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.858–0.985]. The number of
circulating megakaryocytes was potentially associated with good
patient survival in advanced prostate cancer (HR, 0.849; 95% CI,
0.628–1.146, per cell increase), and the difference between the
number of mesenchymal CTCs and megakaryocytes strongly
correlated to poor survival (HR, 10.17; 95% CI, 2.164–47.789,
if score �2.0).
Conclusions: This CTC analysis approach and the potential
association of megakaryocytes with cancer prognosis may greatly
enhance our ability to investigate the cancer metastasis process
and to predict/monitor cancer progression. Clin Cancer Res; 23(17);

Introduction
Cancer cells evolve during disease progression and in response
to treatment (1), influencing their sensitivity to treatment. Cir-
culating tumor cells (CTC) are considered to be the seeds of
metastases (2) and, at the same time, a source of information
on tumor tissue that can be acquired through a simple blood
sample. Even before a metastatic tumor is clinically evident, it has
been reported that a large number of CTCs already exist in the
circulation (3, 4). This provides a more accessible "liquid biopsy"
than tumor tissue biopsies to predict/monitor disease progression
and therapy response at both cellular and molecular level. How-
ever, current CTC analysis mainly focused on cells expressing
epithelial phenotype-specific markers (2). In fact, activation of
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process in
cancer metastasis (5) and an important factor in promoting
invasiveness of cancer cells and their resistance to therapy (6).
Both downregulation of epithelial markers, such as epithelial cell
adhesion molecule (EpCAM), cytokeratin (CK), and E-cadherin,
and upregulation of mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin
(VIM) and N-cadherin, have been described (7, 8). Hence, CTCs
undergoing EMT as part of the metastatic process may be missed
when isolated on the basis of their epithelial characteristics only.
To address this challenge, we have optimized a novel epitope-
independent CTC isolation system, Parsortix, to capture CTCs
based on the much larger size and less deformability nature of
tumor cells compared with normal blood cells (9). The efficiency
of Parsortix in capturing CTCs has been independently validated
by other research groups in comparison with CellSearch in
patients with small-cell lung cancer (10), and other types of
cancers, including breast, colon, and lung (11). Here, we explored
its clinical application in prostate cancer prognosis and disease
state monitoring.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in Western men
(12, 13). Current criteria for risk stratification of newly diagnosed

 prostate cancer are mainly based on clinical features, including
serum PSA, clinical stage, and biopsy/surgical specimen Gleason
score (GS; ref. 14). However, these factors are not sufficient to
discriminate between patients with indolent and aggressive dis-
ease. Furthermore, when metastatic disease progresses to castra-
tion-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the established PSA test is
not satisfactory for disease prognosis and monitoring. These
current clinical unmet needs urge us to identify novel biomarkers
that can monitor disease status precisely, accessibly, and in real
time. Therefore, we investigated the potential of analyzing CTCs
with both epithelial and mesenchymal features for cancer prog-
nosis using Parsortix system in prostate cancer as a disease model.
We developed a novel technique to perform five rounds of fluo-
rescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the same slides after
immunofluorescence staining. Using this technique, we simulta-
neously identified the epithelial and mesenchymal cell features and
multiple genomic alterations, confirming the malignancy of circu-
lating cells with mesenchymal phenotype. We also demonstrated
the correlation of CTCs with advanced disease features. Unexpect-
edly, we discovered that an increase of circulating megakaryocytes
had the trend to be correlated with good prognosis in patients with
progressive disease and the combination of CTC and megakaryo-
cyte count may effectively predict survival in advanced disease.
Materials and Methods
Patients and blood samples
A total of 81 patients with written consent were recruited in
December 2014 from St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health
NHS (London, United Kingdom), comprising 38 with untreated
localized prostate cancer, and 43 with progressive CRPC (40 with
metastasis) ready to commence an alternative treatment. The
clinical information is summarized in Table 1, and details of
sample collection and clinical information are shown in Supple-
mentary Data and Supplementary Table S1. Blood specimens
from 24 healthy male donors were collected with signed ethics
committee–approved consent forms. Whole blood (7.5 mL) was
donated from each participant for CTC enumeration. Use of
blood samples from patients and healthy donors in this study
was approved by National Research Ethics Service committee
London City and East with a Research Ethics Committee reference
of 09/H0704/4þ5.
CTC isolation and enumeration
Isolation of CTCs from whole blood using a size- and deform-
ability-based system Parsortix was performed as described previ-
ously (9). Sample harvest and the process of immunostaining are
detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Different
DAPIþ populations of cells were recorded, including CKþ/
VIM�/CD45�, CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�, and CK�/VIMþ/CD45�.
FISH after immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescence signals were washed in a stripping
buffer (containing 2% SDS, 0.0625 mol/L Tris-HCl pH 6.8,
and 0.8% b-mercaptoethanol) at 50�C for 20 minutes, followed
by washing three times in PBS for 5 minutes. Details of FISH
probe and multiple FISH procedure are indicated in Supple-
mentary Materials and Methods. Ten FISH probes for nine
commonly altered genes/genomic regions in prostate cancer,
including 6q16, NKX3.1, C-MYC, PTEN, CCND1, RB1, 16q22.1,
ERG, and AR were used for CTC analysis. The copy number of
each FISH probe was counted in CKþ/VIM�/CD45�, CKþ/
VIMþ/CD45�, CK�/VIMþ/CD45�, and CK�/VIM�/CD45� cells.
The copy number of lymphocytes from the prostate cancer
patients and healthy donors was used to calculate the baseline
for each genetic change. FISH signals from >100 lymphocytes
were counted in each sample.
Statistical analysis
Unless specifically noted, Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied
to assess the equality of CTCs between subgroups based on CTC
score as well as different clinical features, such as metastasis,
primary GS, and risk classification in localized disease. Data
shown were as median [interquartile range (IQR)]. Spearman
rank correlation was used to assess the association between CTC
counts and concurrent PSA level. Bivariate logistic regression was
performed with PSA and EMTing CTC counts as predictors for
imaging-detected metastasis (yes, no). A combined risk score
(CRS) was computed as the linear predictor of the fitted bivariate
logistic model with PSA and EMTing CTC count as only predictors
(as CRS ¼ a � PSA þ b � EMTing CTC count, where the values of "a"
and "b" are the estimated log odds ratios). ROC curve analysis was
used to test the ability of different subtypes of CTCs as well as CRS
to distinguish patients with metastasis. Optimal cut-off point was
calculated with an optimal-corrected classified value to provide
bestavailable sensitivityandspecificity.Rocgoldfunction was used
to independently test the equality of the ROC area of each method
against the PSA as a standard curve. The combined mesenchymal
CTC and megakaryocyte score (CMS) was calculated as:
Mesenchymal CTC count � megakaryocte count
Megakaryocte count
Because of the possible absence of megakaryocytes detected in
patients, megakaryocyte count ¼ 0 was recorded as 1 for this score
calculation. To determine the factors that predict survival time,
variables considered as potential predictors were selected for uni-
variate analyses using Cox model. The hazard ratio (HR) associated
Translational Relevance
Here, we firstly developed an optimized approach to robust-
ly wash off immunofluorescence signals and perform multiple
rounds of FISH analysis on the same cells. This facilitates the
genomic analysis and confirmation of circulating tumor cells
(CTC), valuable for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and progres-
sion monitoring. Prostate cancer patients with advanced clin-
ical features showed an increasing number of epithelial/EMT-
ing/mesenchymal CTCs. The presence of metastasis was effi-
ciently predicted by a combined risk score based on both
serum PSA level and EMTing CTC count. These analyses greatly
enhance our ability to investigate the metastasis process and to
predict/monitor cancer progression. The most important nov-
el finding was the association of circulating megakaryocytes
with good prognosis. In combination with mesenchymal CTC
count, they showed great cancer prognosis potential. The
identification of circulating megakaryocytes and their associ-
ation with cancer prognosis potentially opens a new revenue
to investigate cancer progression and to develop novel prog-
nostic biomarkers.

 witheachbiomarkerwas derived fromthe Coxmodel asanincrease
in the hazard per unit increase in biomarker. Because of the small
sample size, P values for the HR were further adjusted by false
discovery rate (FDR) using Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment
method (15). Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. All statistical
tests were two sided and P values less than 0.05 (including multiple
test adjustment where relevant) were considered as statistically
significant. Bonferroni correction test was performed to modify
P values for multiple tests through dividing the critical P value by
the number of comparisons being made. Statistical analyses were
performed using Stata 13.0.
Results
Detection of circulating cells with epithelial and mesenchymal
features
Using our optimized CTC isolation and detection method (9),
we analyzed blood samples from 81 prostate cancer patients (Table
1; Supplementary Table S1) to identify CKþ/VIM�/CD45�, CKþ/
VIMþ/CD45� and CK�/VIMþ/CD45� circulating cells (Fig. 1A).All
three types of cells have been detected at high frequencies both in
the blood of CRPC and localized cancer patients, and they are
higher in CRPC patients than those in untreated patients (Table 1).
Of 81 patients studied, 15 patients (19%) had no detectable CKþ/
CD45� cells but detectable CK�/VIMþ/CD45� circulating cells.
Genetic evidence that CK�/VIMþ/CD45� circulating cells are
malignant cells with genomic alterations
To confirm the malignant feature of CK�/VIMþ/CD45� circu-
lating cells by detecting multiple genomic alterations, we devel-
oped a technology for repeated multiple rounds of FISH analysis
after immunofluorescence staining and applied it on the CTC
samples. This postimmunofluorescence multiple FISH analysis
technique was developed using slides with lymphocytes spiked
with PC3 cells, in which we removed the immunofluorescence
signals completely by the stripping buffer, but not by 2� SSC
buffer, fix solution, or proteinase K digestion. The length of
polylysine slide coating time was optimized to 45 minutes to
best preserve cells for downstream repeated FISH analysis after
signal striping. Less coating time frequently resulted in damaged
or lost cells after signal striping. Using these optimized condi-
tions, we detected clear nuclear morphology and FISH signals in
up to the fifth round of FISH on cells after immunofluorescence
(Supplementary Fig. S1). In the leucocytes from the healthy
donors, the average false-positive rates for the probes range from
0.7% to 7.1% (Supplementary Table S2).
The multiple FISH technique was then successfully applied to
11 prostate cancer CTC cases for five rounds of FISH (Fig. 1B) and
one case for two rounds due to strong florescence background, to
investigate the genomic alterations of nine genomic regions,
including chromosomal copy number changes and/or rearrange-
ments. In the leucocytes from 3 randomly selected patients, the
average false-positive rates for the probes range from 1.5% to
7.8% (Supplementary Table S2). In CTCs from anindividual, each
of the genomic changes was only detected in a proportion of cells,
indicating genomic heterogeneity. In the limited number of cases
and limited number of CTCs in each case, no obvious genomic
change patterns specific to a subgroup of epithelial or mesenchy-
mal CTCs were observed. Changes of more than 30% of the
genomic regions were detected in 68% of CKþ/VIM�/CD45�
cells, 57% of CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�, cells and 54% of CK�/VIMþ/

 CD45� cells, but only detected in 3.7% of CK�/VIM�/CD45þ
leucocytes and 7.8% of CK�/VIM�/CD45� cells (Supplementary
Table S3). The similar rate of genetic changes in the CKþ/VIM�/
CD45�, CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�, and CK�/VIMþ/CD45� circulating
cells indicates that the majority of CK�/VIMþ/CD45� cells were
CTCs. Although it is possible that small proportions of the above
three circulating cell categories are of nonmalignant origin, we
considered all CKþ/VIM�/CD45�, CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�, and CK�/
VIMþ/CD45� cells for the correlation analysis between CTC
numbers and clinical features and categorized them as epithelial,
EMTing, or mesenchymal CTCs, respectively. When classifying
cases as positive or negative for CTCs, the number of CKþ/VIM�/
CD45�, CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�, and CK�/VIMþ/CD45� circulating
cells found in noncancer healthy control cases were considered.
Association of CTC positivity with advanced clinical features in
localized and metastatic prostate cancer
Analyzing blood samples from 24 healthy male donors, we
detected one, two, and three CK�/VIMþ/CD45� cells in three,
two, and two samples, respectively, and none in the remaining 17
samples (median 0, range 0–3 cells/7.5 mL), and complete
absence of CKþ/VIM�/CD45� or CKþ/VIMþ/CD45� circulating
cells. Consequently, we defined positive CTC cases as those
showing any CKþ/VIM�/CD45�, any CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�, and/or
>3 CK�/VIMþ/CD45� cells to prevent potential false positive,
although a better definition may be worked out from future large
cohort studies. On the basis of these criteria, 24 of 38 patients with
untreated localized disease (63%) and 41 of 43 CRPC patients
(95%) scored positive for CTCs. Excluding mesenchymal CTCs
reduced CTC positivity to 20 (53%) and 38 (88%) in these two
groups of patients, respectively. In all 81 patients, high serum PSA
level, high GS, and metastatic status were significantly correlated
with CTC score–positive patients. In the 38 untreated localized
diseases, CTC score–positive cases have a trend to be associated
with high-risk classification based on National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline version 1, 2016 (16), which
should be further validated in a large sample cohort (Supple-
mentary Table S4).
Association of subgroups of CTCs with serum PSA level,
primary biopsy GS, and the risk of localized tumor
We further analyzed the relationship of different subpopula-
tions of CTCs to PSA level, primary GS, and the risk of localized
cancer. Although all three subpopulations of CTC numbers were
significantly correlated to serum PSA levels (Spearman r ¼ 0.28,
0.26, and 0.36, and P ¼ 0.01, 0.019, and 0.0009, respectively, for
CKþ/VIM�/CD45�, CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�, and CK�/VIMþ/CD45�
CTCs), themesenchymal type had the mostsignificant association
(Fig. 2A). As expected, the total number of CTCs had an even more
significant correlation (Spearman r ¼ 0.49, P < 0.0001) due to the
greater number of events included for analysis. Because of the
multiple tests for analysis, Bonferroni correction test was per-
formed to modify the significant P values. After adjustment,
mesenchymal CTC alone, but not epithelial and EMTing CTC
alone, reached statistical significance. Traditional CTCs (combina-
tion of epithelial and EMTing CTC) had a significant correlation.
Higher CTC count was also detected in patients with higher GS
of primary tumor regardless of therapies received, and mesen-
chymal CTCs had the most significant association (P ¼ 0.001).
When total CTCs were included for analysis, a stronger association
was observed (P ¼ 0.0001; Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S5). After
multiple test correction, both epithelial and mesenchymal sub-
types of CTCs alone were correlated with higher GS.
When the 38 untreated patients with localized disease were
divided into low/intermediate and high-risk groups based on
NCCN guideline, the number of each subtype of CTCs was higher

 in high-risk group compared with low/intermediate group (Fig.
2C; Supplementary Table S5). After adjustment for multiple tests,
EMTing CTCs and the traditional CTCs (epithelial and EMTing
CTCs) still remained statistically significant.
EMTing CTC number was significantly associated with the
presence of metastasis
When we correlated the numbers of different subpopulations
of CTCs to cancer metastasis, the presence of metastases was
significantly associated with higher number of any type of CTCs
and the association with EMTing CTCs was most significant (P ¼
0.0001), which was similar in significance when considering total
CTCs (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Table S5). Each subtype of CTCs
alone achieved a statistical significance after P value adjustment
for multiple tests. When a ROC curve was applied to explore the
role of CTCs in metastases prediction in comparison with PSA,
EMTing CTC count (with an optimal cut-off point at �2 cells) had
the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) score [0.755; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 0.654–0.856] of all types of CTCs.
Although the efficiency was lower than PSA (AUC ¼ 0.823;
95% CI, 0.720–0.927, with an optimal cut-off point at �23
ng/mL; Supplementary Table S6), when EMTing CTC count and
PSA were combined to create a CRS (as CRS ¼ 0.012 � PSA þ 0.115
� EMTing CTC count), the CRS (AUC ¼ 0.921; 95% CI, 0.858–
0.985) was a significantly (P ¼ 0.03) better predictor of metastasis
than PSA score alone (Fig. 2E). The increased performance of the
CRS for metastasis prediction compared with PSA at different
sensitivity and specificity level is presented in Supplementary
Table S7. Box plots of CRS in patients with/without metastasis
are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A.
Mesenchymal CTC count is potentially associated with poor
survival
Survival analysis was performed in the 40 metastatic CRPC
(mCRPC) patients with a median follow-up time of 11.8 months
(range, 0.7–19.7 months), of which 11 (27.5%) had died. Median
follow-up time for patients still alive at the endpoint was 13.3
months (range, 4.1–19.7 months). Table 2 shows the association
between potential risk factors and survival derived from Cox
model with adjusted P value using Benjamini and Hochberg
method (15). High PSA level (P ¼ 0.015), high serum ALP level
(P ¼ 0.015), and high serum LDH level (P ¼ 0.040) were found to
be associated with increased risk of death in univariate analyses.
None of the subtypes of CTCs had a significant association in this
small cohort. However, when a cutoff was selected to optimally
demonstrate the significance (Supplementary Fig. S3), patients
with mesenchymal CTCs (�5 cells) had an HR of 8.458 (95% CI,
1.815–39.411; P ¼ 0.001). Patients with epithelial (�3 cells),
EMTing (�2 cells), and total CKþ (�6 cells) CTCs had an HR of
2.765 (95% CI, 0.732–10.438), 1.858 (95% CI, 0.491–7.033),
and 1.537 (95% CI, 0.449–5.261), respectively; none reached
statistical significance.
The presence of circulating megakaryocytes was associated with
better survival
Unexpectedly, we found a rare population of cells in the harvest
samples, with big nuclei (larger than both lymphocytes and most
CTCs) of strong DAPI staining, but negative for CK, VIM, and
CD45 (called BigNeg below; Fig. 3A). Because of the strong DAPI
staining and larger size of nuclei, such cells were easily identified
from other cells with DAPI staining alone (Fig. 3B). Through the
absence of CK, VIM, and CD45 staining, it was possible to exclude
CTCs. FISH analysis for these cells showed 100% polyploidy and
most (61.9%) of them had more than 10 copies of the genome in
each cell (Fig. 3C), suggesting a special type of cells, distinct to
lymphocytes or CTCs. The mean nuclear diameter of BigNeg cells
was 17.5 � 4.9 mm (range, 10–32 mm), whereas the mean nuclear
diameter for lymphocytes was 6.5 � 0.8 mm (range, 4–8 mm). No
overlapping in nuclear size was observed between these two
categories (Fig. 3D). Therefore, BigNeg cells were distinguishable
from other cells by means of immunostaining and size measure-
ment using the following criteria: cells with a strong DAPI-stained
nucleus �10 mm in size and negative for CD45, CK, and VIM
staining. Using these criteria, such cells were counted in all 81
blood samples. The numbers were variable and lower in mCRPC
patients who died during follow-up (median 1 cell/7.5 mL; IQR,
2-1 cells/7.5 mL) than those mCRPC patients still alive (median 2
cells/7.5 mL, IQR: 4-1 cells/7.5 mL), and also than patients with
untreated localized disease (median 2 cells/7.5 mL, IQR: 4.25-0
cells/7.5 mL), although none of the differences reached signifi-
cance (P value of 0.18 and 0.33, respectively). In the 40 mCRPC
patients, high BigNeg cell count had a trend to be associated with
better survival (HR, 0.849; 95% CI, 0.628–1.146; Padj ¼
0.31; Table 2). When a cutoff was selected, patients with BigNeg
(�3 cells) had an HR of 0.144 (95% CI, 0.018–1.129; P ¼ 0.02).
The estimated survival rates were significantly higher in those with
�3 BigNeg cells by Kaplan–Meier curve (P ¼ 0.03, Fig. 4A). On the
basis of previous results that high mesenchymal CTC counts
generally represent more aggressive tumors and are associated
with a higher risk for death, we hypothesize that the difference
between the number of mesenchymal CTCs and BigNeg cells may
further enhance the ability to predict survival. Using the formula
[(mesenchymal CTC count – BigNeg cell count)/BigNeg cell count
as detailed in the method and a univariate Cox model for survival
analysis, the HR for per unit increase of the score is 1.282 (95% CI,
1.097–1.499; Padj ¼ 0.015); Table 2]. When a cutoff was selected,
patients with CMS (�2.0) had an HR of 10.170 (95% CI, 2.164–
47.789; P ¼ 0.0005) and by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, a
CMS 2.0 cutoff most significantly separated different survival
groups (P ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 4B).
In blood samples from the 24 healthy donors, the median
number of BigNeg cells was 1 cell/7.5 mL (range, 0–15; IQR, 2.5-0;
Supplementary Fig. S2B), which was slightly lower than that in the

ally significantly lower than that in 43 CRPC patients (median, 2;

Finally, we characterized the BigNeg cells. Their consistent
hyperploidy revealed by FISH analysis highly suggested a poten-
tial megakaryocyte-like origin. We established the megakaryo-
cytes immunofluorescence analysis method by detecting CD34
and CD41 expression in megakaryocytes induced by phorbol
myristate acetate from K562 cells (Fig. 4C). All BigNeg cells were
CD34þ with 92% (101/110) CD41þ, confirming them as a
specific group of megakaryocytes (Fig. 4D). CD45þ lymphocytes,
epithelial CTCs, EMTing CTCs, and mesenchymal CTCs were all
negative for CD34 and CD41.
Discussion
We have previously shown that CD45� cells with both epithe-
lial and mesenchymal features can be detected in prostate cancer
patients using Parsortix (9). Here, we developed a repeated FISH
analysis approach following immunofluorescence analysis on the
same slide to investigate multiple genomic regions for alterations
and, consequently, establish the malignancy of VIMþ/CD45� cell
populations, which were associated with disease burden and poor
prognosis and have the potential to serve as an additional marker
to traditional epithelial CTCs for clinical application. As EMT is a
critical step for cancer metastasis, analyzing EMT CTCs has great
potential for cancer prognosis and progression monitoring
(7, 17). Several non–EpCAM-based CTC isolation platforms have
been developed to analyze CTCs with EMT, such as ISET (18, 19)
and Vitatex CAM platform (20). CTCs with ongoing EMT or
completely changed into mesenchymal features have been iden-
tified, and their biological and genetic differences from CellSearch
captured CTCs have been revealed. To our knowledge, the current
study is the first genetic investigation of EMT CTCs using repeated
FISH and the first investigation of potential prognostic value of
EMT CTCs in prostate cancer.
Repeated FISH analysis of CTCs generates genomic alteration
information for multiple genomic regions in single cells, enabling
the confirmation of the malignant genomic feature of suspicious
CTCs, investigation of the heterogeneity of cancer cells by analyz-
ing the differences in genomic alterations between individual cells,
and correlation of genomic alterations with cellular features and
different types of CTCs to understand mechanisms of metastases.
FISH analysis performed on cells analyzed by immunostaining
(21–24) has been previously performed by using traditional
fixation with ethanol or methanol mixed with acetic acid (24)
and treatment with pepsin (21) to remove immunofluorescence

 signals. However, based on our experience, it was difficult to
achieve complete removal of previous immunofluorescence sig-
nals using these pretreatments and the leftover fluorescence signals
often interfered with FISH signal interpretation. Our stripping
buffer method, robustly removing immunofluorescence signals
completely without damaging cell morphology, facilitates the
analysis of multiple genomic alterations on the same cells after
immunofluorescence, which increases the chance to detect geno-
micalterations in most CTCsto confirm their malignancy nature. A
panel of genes is better than a single gene or genetic change for
cancer prognosis (25). Multiple genomic region analysis also
makes it possible to combine a number of genomic changes for
the development of CTC-based genetic prognostic biomarkers.
However, in this study, FISH was primarily used to confirm the
malignancy of EMT CTCs. We observed a high frequency of
alterations in CTCs in the genomic regions investigated, suggesting
that extensive genomic alterations occur in CTCs at the stage of
cancer metastasis. This is consistent with a previous report that
metastatic prostate cancer has more genomic alterations than
primary tumor (26). Our results also showed that genomic het-
erogeneity exists in prostate cancer CTCs.
In this study, we demonstrated the association of CTC number
with GS and the aggressiveness of localized disease, which have
not been reported previously. Association of detection of �5
traditional CellSearch isolated CTCs/7.5 mL with poor prognosis
in patients with advanced prostate cancer was initially reported
around a decade ago (27–29) and has been recently further
validated in several large-scaled clinical trials (30–33). In
our small patient cohort, we observed the associations of
�3 epithelial CTCs (CKþ/VIM�/CD45�), �2 EMTing CTCs
(CKþ/VIMþ/CD45�), and �6 traditional CTCs (combination of
epithelial and EMTing type) with advanced clinical features,
Figure 4.
BigNeg cell count was associated with survival, and their megakaryocyte nature was confirmed by immunofluorescence. A, Kaplan–Meier curve for overall
survival showed progressive prostate cancer patients with less than three BigNeg cells had significantly shorter survival rates (P ¼ 0.032). B, Kaplan–Meier curve for
overall survival showed progressive prostate cancer patients with CMS �2.0 had even poorer survival (P ¼ 0.0003). C, PMA-treated K562 cell lines were
positive for CD34 and CD41 staining with various patterns: strong CD41 but weak CD34 (top row), similar signal strength of CD41 and CD34 (middle row), and strong
CD34 but negative CD41 (bottom row). Cells with obvious CD41 signals were larger than those without or with very weak CD41 staining. D, Top and middle
row, BigNeg cells were positive for both CD41 and CD34, and signals of CD41 were relatively stronger. Bottom row, one BigNeg cell was positive for CD34 but not
CD41. The adjacent CD45þ (image not shown) lymphocyte (with arrowhead) was negative for both CD34 and CD41. BigNeg cells positive for CD41 were
relatively larger than those with no CD41 expression.

 CRPC development, and poorer survival, which is consistent with
these previous reports analyzing epithelial CTCs. By analyzing
mesenchymal CTCs, we detected an increase of CTC-positive cases
in both CRPC and localized diseases. Of interest, high baseline
mesenchymal CTC count (�5 cells/7.5 mL) before an alternative
treatment in CRPC patients was better associated with poorer
survival than the traditional CKþ CTCs in our cohort, which
warrants further investigation. Moreover, mesenchymal CTCs
associated with PSA level and GS better than epithelial CTCs and
EMTing CTCs were most significantly correlated to cancer metas-
tasis. All these data indicate a potential better prognostic value of
mesenchymal than epithelial CTCs in prostate cancer. As the
number of patients in this study is still small, these associations
should be validated in large cohorts of samples. EMT has been
increasingly recognized for its role in tumor cell invasion, met-
astatic dissemination, and acquisition of therapeutic resistance
(6). Loss of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, and gain of
mesenchymal markers, such as VIM and N-cadherin, have been
proven to be associated with more invasive phenotype or higher
GS in prostate cancer cells (34, 35). EMTing CTCs were most
significantly associated with both high-risk localized disease and
metastasis, suggesting that these cells under active EMT process are
potential indicators for cancer-aggressive invasion and metastasis.
Taken together, compared with traditional CKþ CTCs, CTCs
undergoing or undergone EMT provided more information about
disease burden and intrinsic tumor biology.
Radionuclide bone-scan and CT, the current gold standard
procedures to detect metastatic sites, are costly, time-consuming,
and expose patients to radiation. Patients who are unlikely to have
metastasis are better off avoiding these costly and potentially
harmful procedures. PSA level has been used to predict bone
metastases and select patients for bone scans (16). Although our
data also showed a strong association between PSA and metastasis
and none of the CTC analyses taken alone outperformed PSA for
metastatic correlation, a CRS based on both PSA level and EMTing
CTC count significantly improved the metastasis prediction accu-
racy compared with PSA alone. This suggests that although PSA
level correlates with CTC count, they are independent factors
contributing to cancer metastasis, potentially by representing
different aspects of tumor biology. Large-scale trials are warranted
to confirm this superior metastasis prediction model.
The most striking finding is the unexpected discovery of
increased circulating megakaryocytes in cancer patients and its
association with the survival of CRPC patients. As the nuclei of
megakaryocytes are big and with strong DAPI staining, they can be
easily identified during CTC analysis. A group of large hyperploid
cells with no detectable biomarkers (including epithelial and
hepatocellular cancer specific markers) have also been reported
recently (36). As the authors did not include any mesenchymal
markers, they considered all these cells as CTCs with EMT. On the
basis of our study, these cells might be a mixture of mesenchymal
CTCs and circulating megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytes have also
been identified in a previous CTC study of prostate cancer, but the
investigators excluded themfor furtheranalysis(23). Taking advan-
tageof the sizeand/ordeformability-based CTC isolation platform,
for example, Parsortix here, such cells can be captured with high
efficiency for cancer prognosis analysis. With the development
of multiple treatment approaches for CRPC patients, real-time
prognostic and therapeutic response–predictive biomarkers are
critical for stratified patient management. However, currently, only
CellSearch-based CTC analysis, which mainly detects cells with
epithelial features, is approved by FDA for CRPC patient sur-
vival prediction (2). Here, we not only showed that mesenchy-
mal CTCs has the potential to be better associated with patient
survival than CTCs with epithelial features, but also found that
the combination of mesenchymal CTC and megakaryocyte
counts has a great power to predict CRPC patient survival, with
1.28-fold risk of death per unit increase of the CMS and 10-fold
risk for patients with a score �2.0.
In addition to the bone marrow and the spleen, megakaryocytes
have also been detected at very low numbers in circulation (37,
38). CD34 expresses in hematopoietic stem cells and megakar-
yocyte progenitor cells, which are all diploidy cells (39). Its
expression can also be seen on mature-appearing megakaryocytes
in reactive and disorders of bone marrows (40). CD41 is a
megakaryocytic lineage-specific marker, expressing neither in
endothelial cells nor monocytes (39, 41, 42). The circulating
megakaryocytes detected in our study with high DNA content
and consistent expression of CD34 represent a specific and
potentially abnormal type of megakaryocytes, in which endo-
nuclear DNA replication is active but the CD34 expression is not
switched off, hence premature high DNA content megakaryocytes
without apparent lobulated nuclei. This is consistent to the
finding of CD34 expression in mature-appearing megakaryocytes
in reactive and disorders of bone marrows (40), and increased
ploidization of megakaryocytes has been reported in patients with
metastatic tumors (43). Platelets, which are released from mega-
karyocytes in bone marrow, have recently been recognized to play
an important role in cancer metastasis (44, 45), and the gene
expression profile of platelets has been shown to efficiently
distinguish individuals with or without cancers (46). Platelet
counts have also been investigated for cancer prognosis, and the
data are still in conflict (47). In this study, there was no correlation
of the number of platelets with either circulating megakaryocytes
or cancer prognosis.
The association of high number of megakaryocytes with a good
survival of CRPC patients suggests an antitumor effect of mega-
karyocytes. To support this, megakaryocytes have been reported to
increase their number in response to cancer bone metastasis and
inhibit prostate and breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in
vivo (48–50). Although the prognostic value and biological func-
tions of megakaryocytes in cancer development and progression
need to be further investigated, models that analyze the number
difference between CTCs and megakaryocytes should be devel-
oped to make an efficient biomarker for survival prediction for
patients with mCRPCs and potentially for other cancers as well.
With further validation and cutoff optimization in large sample
cohorts, this study has the potential to be translated into clinical
use, for patients not only with prostate cancer but also a range of
other human malignancies.
