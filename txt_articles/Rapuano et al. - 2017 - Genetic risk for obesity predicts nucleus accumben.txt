Obesity is a major public health concern that involves an in-
teraction between genetic susceptibility and exposure to environ-
mental cues (e.g., food marketing); however, the mechanisms that
link these factors and contribute to unhealthy eating are unclear.
Using a well-known obesity risk polymorphism (FTO rs9939609) in
a sample of 78 children (ages 9–12 y), we observed that children at
risk for obesity exhibited stronger responses to food commercials
in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) than children not at risk. Simi-
larly, children at a higher genetic risk for obesity demonstrated
larger NAcc volumes. Although a recessive model of this polymor-
phism best predicted body mass and adiposity, a dominant model
was most predictive of NAcc size and responsivity to food cues.
These findings suggest that children genetically at risk for obesity
are predisposed to represent reward signals more strongly, which,
in turn, may contribute to unhealthy eating behaviors later in life.

T
he relationship between genes and sensitivity to environ-
mental cues is elusive, yet it is paramount to understanding the
development of potentially maladaptive human behaviors. The ris-
ing prevalence of obesity is a major public health concern that has
been attributed to various factors, such as genetic susceptibility (1),
and increases in the availability and marketing of calorie-dense
foods (2). However, little is known about how genetic predisposition
to obesity influences sensitivity to real-world food cues and con-
tributes to the development of unhealthy eating behaviors.
Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that responses
to food cues in reward-related regions of the brain, such as the
nucleus accumbens (NAcc), predict weight gain in adulthood (3)
and giving in to food temptations in daily life (4). Furthermore,
structural differences in NAcc volume have been positively associ-
ated with body mass index (BMI) in adults (5, 6). Because the de-
velopment of the NAcc precedes the development of prefrontal
control systems (7), this structure is suggested to play a key role in
motivating and establishing unhealthy eating behaviors early in the
lifespan. Importantly, genetic factors are a known contributor to
brain development (8) and may influence risky behaviors during
childhood and adolescence by biasing the early development of
anatomical structures underlying reward-related brain function.
In addition, the notion that genes contribute to obesity has re-
cently gained much attention. More specifically, the fat-mass and
obesity-associated (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism has been
strongly related to increased BMI and adiposity across the lifespan,
and is suggested to influence food intake and food choice, rather
than energy expenditure (9–11). Those with two high-risk “A” al-
leles (AA) are at an enhanced risk for obesity compared with those
with two low-risk “T” alleles (TT) or those who are heterozygous
(AT) for the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism. Although the FTO
gene is highly expressed in the brain (1), the mechanism by which
this gene promotes unhealthy eating behaviors remains poorly un-
derstood. Previous studies have suggested that FTO alters dopa-
minergic midbrain circuitry (12, 13). Thus, one possibility is that the
FTO gene influences the early development and responsivity of
reward-related brain structures, thereby predisposing individuals to
develop patterns of unhealthy eating. Prior neuroimaging studies
examining the influence of variants in this gene on brain structure
and function have primarily been reported in adults, and therefore
may be missing important genetic associations that manifest early in
development and predispose individuals to develop patterns of
unhealthy eating. Indeed, findings in these adult studies are some-
what mixed, with gene-related effects reported across a number of
brain regions not traditionally associated with reward, including the
posterior cingulate, cuneus, precuneus, and fusiform gyrus (14, 15).
Only one study thus far has reported a relationship between FTO
rs9939609 and neural responses to food cues in a canonical reward
region: the putamen (14). A separate study observed modulatory
effects of physiological state (fed versus fasting) and metabolic state
(circulating acetyl-ghrelin) on responses to food in reward-related
brain regions (16). Here, we extend prior neuroimaging work on
obesity and the influence of FTO rs9939609 by targeting reward
responses to naturalistic food cues in a pediatric population.
To examine the relationship between genetic risk for obesity and
sensitivity to real-world food cues, we used functional and structural
MRI (fMRI and sMRI) to measure NAcc responsivity to food ad-
vertisements and NAcc volumes, respectively. Adapted from an fMRI
paradigm previously used with adolescents (17), food and nonfood
commercials were embedded into the natural breaks of an age-
appropriate television show (Fig. 1A). Participants (n = 78; ages 9–12 y)
Significance
Genetic predisposition and sensitivity to environmental cues
jointly give rise to maladaptive human behaviors, such as un-
healthy eating. Despite the dramatic rise in obesity rates, the
relationship between these factors is not well understood.
Here we show that children genetically at risk for obesity ex-
hibit stronger reward-related responses to real-world food
cues (i.e., food advertisements) in the nucleus accumbens, a
brain area canonically associated with reward processing. Ad-
ditionally, this structure is larger in children at a higher risk for
obesity. Taken together, these findings offer one explanation
for how genetic risk for obesity may predispose individuals to
engage in unhealthy eating behaviors and may inform strate-
gies targeting early intervention.

 were genotyped for FTO rs9939609 (AA, TT, or AT) and were led to
believe that we were interested in brain activity associated with
watching television, thereby keeping participants naïve to the study
purpose and increasing the ecological validity of our paradigm (see
Table S1 for participant characteristics). In addition to examining
differences in NAcc responsivity related to genetic risk for obesity, we
extracted volumetric estimates of the NAcc for each subject to ex-
amine structural associations with FTO genotype (Fig. 1B). We hy-
pothesized that children at a higher genetic risk for obesity would
exhibit stronger NAcc activity to real-world food cues as well as ex-
hibit larger NAcc volumes. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these
relationships would be independent of current obesity status, thereby
demonstrating specificity to genetic risk based on FTO genotype
rather than risk based on early-life presence of overweight or obesity.
Results
Association Between Anthropometric Measures and Genetic Risk for
Obesity. A one-way ANOVA accounting for age and sex demon-
strated a differential effect of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism on
BMI [F(2, 73) = 7.1; P < 0.002; ηp
2 = 0.148] and percent body fat
measured via bioelectric impedance [F(2, 73) = 3.9; P < 0.05; ηp
2 =
0.090] across AA (n = 19), AT (n = 37), and TT (n = 22) individuals
(Fig. 2A). To examine the specific influence of the high-risk (A) allele
on obesity in children, we considered additive (AA > AT > TT),
recessive (AA > AT and TT), and dominant (AA and AT > TT)
models of the FTO genotype. Because of the high collinearity of these
models and the number of multiple comparisons reported throughout
the manuscript, significance was determined using �
Sidák correction
based on the effective number of independent variables (Meff) iden-
tified using matrix spectral decomposition (18, 19) across all statistical
tests performed (n = 18, six dependent variables × three candidate
genetic models) (Methods). Here, the effective number of independent
tests was determined to be 4.06 (19) and the adjusted threshold for
significance 0.0125 (SI Text). The findings reported here were signif-
icant regardless of the multiple-comparison correction implemented,
and other multiple-comparison correction approaches are reported
in the SI Text when such approaches are standard for the field.
Planned contrasts demonstrated a recessive model of the FTO
genotype to most strongly predict anthropometric phenotype, such
that AA children were at a statistically greater risk for obesity than
either AT and TT children, evidenced by higher BMI [t(73) = 3.5;
P < 0.001; η2 = 0.191] and body fat percentages [t(73) = 2.6; P <
0.02; η2 = 0.121]. Consistent with previous studies (1), FTO
genotypes also demonstrated a significant additive association
with BMI [t(73) = 2.9; P < 0.05]; however, this additive rela-
tionship was not significantly associated with percent body fat
after correcting for multiple comparisons [t(73) = 2.1; P = 0.04].
The dominant model of the FTO genotype was not significantly as-
sociated with BMI [t(73) = 1.7; P = 0.13] or percent body fat [t(73) =
1.1; P = 0.29] (see Table S2 for full regression models).
Association Between NAcc Responses to Food Cues and Genetic Risk
for Obesity. Given our hypothesis that food commercials (relative to
nonfood commercials) would engage the NAcc more strongly in in-
dividuals at a genetically higher risk for obesity, we performed a
targeted region-of-interest (ROI) analysis in the left and right NAcc.
A one-way ANOVA revealed differential effects of the FTO geno-
type on responses to food commercials in both the left [F(2, 73) = 3.9;
P < 0.05; ηp
2 = 0.112] and right [F(2, 73) = 4.1; P < 0.05; ηp
2 = 0.082]
NAcc (Fig. 2B). Similar to the analyses with body anthropometry
reported above, neural responses were tested for genetic associations
based on dominant, additive, and recessive models and significance
was determined by �
Sidák correction based on Meff. In contrast to the
relationship between FTO genotypes and anthropometric phenotypes
(i.e., BMI, percent body fat), neural responses to food commercials
were best characterized by a dominant model of the polymorphism
(AA and AT > TT), such that AT and AA children both exhibited
heightened responsivity relative to TT children in both the left [t(73) =
2.8; P < 0.01] and right [t(73) = 2.9; P < 0.01] NAcc. An additive
model of the FTO polymorphism failed to achieve significance in
NAcc responses after �
Sidák correction [left: t(73) = 2.3; P = 0.03;
right: t(73) = 2.5; P = 0.01]. A recessive model demonstrated no sig-
nificant relationship with neural responses to food commercials [left
NAcc: t(73) = 1.4; P = 0.21; right NAcc: t(73) = 1.7; P = 0.13]. A
comparison of NAcc responses between high-risk individuals (AA
and AT) and low-risk individuals (TT) suggested a moderate-to-large
effect size bilaterally (left: η2 = 0.113; right: η2 = 0.114). Furthermore,
these effects were consistent when controlling for either BMI or
adiposity (Tables S3 and S4). In an analysis restricted to non-Hispanic

Study design. (A) Participants passively viewed food and nonfood (control) commercials embedded within an age-appropriate television show (Nickelodeon’s
Figure it Out). fMRI images were acquired during commercial presentations and anatomical scans were collected during the television show. (B) Independently defined
left and right NAcc masks were used to extract functional responses to food and control commercials for each subject. Blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals
were averaged within each condition and used to examine group differences across FTO genotype. Separately, high-resolution anatomical images were used to
individually segment each participant’s left and right NAcc. Subsequent volume estimates were compared across genotypes.

 white participants (n = 65), the results were consistent and remained
significant (Table S5).
To identify additional brain regions showing a relationship be-
tween food cue-reactivity and the FTO genotype, a whole-brain
exploratory analysis was performed (Fig. 3A). A between-subjects
comparison of at-risk (AA and AT) individuals to low-risk (TT) in-
dividuals identified a single cluster that was more responsive to food
cues in at-risk children. The peak of this cluster was situated within
the medial orbitofrontal cortex (−3, 27, −15) and extended posteri-
orly into bilateral ventral striatum (P < 0.05, cluster corrected).
Association Between NAcc Volume and Genetic Risk for Obesity. To
further examine the influence of the FTO rs9939609 genotype on
reward sensitivity in children, bilateral NAcc volumes were seg-
mented from high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images using
FreeSurfer (20). Controlling for total brain volume as well as age
and sex, a one-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference across
FTO genotypes in the left NAcc [F(2, 62) = 6.0, P < 0.005; ηp
2 =
0.151] and a trending relationship in the right NAcc [F(2, 62) = 3.0,
P = 0.06; ηp
2 = 0.090] (Fig. 2C) in 68 participants that passed quality
assurance; however, similar relationships were observed in the full
cohort (n = 78) (Fig. S1). Consistent with the previous analyses,
additive, dominant, and recessive models of the FTO genotype were
used to assess significant relationships between the risk allele and
NAcc volumes across participants after �
Sidák correction based on
Meff. Planned contrasts demonstrated a dominant model of the
FTO genotype to best predict the volumetric estimates in the left
[t(62) = 3.2, P < 0.005]; however, this model did not significantly
predict volumetric estimates within the right NAcc after correction
[t(62) = 2.3, P = 0.02]. Similarly, NAcc volume demonstrated no
significant relationships with the additive [left: t(62) = 2.5, P = 0.02;
right: t(62) = 1.7, P = 0.09] or recessive [left: t(62) = 1.3, P = 0.22;
right: t(62) = 0.79, P = 0.43] models of the FTO genotype after
correction. Based on the dominant model of the FTO genotype, a
comparison between high- and low-risk individuals revealed a
large effect size in the left NAcc (η2 = 0.167) and a moderate
effect size in the right NAcc (η2 = 0.082). In addition, there was no
relationship between the genotype and a control structure, the left
hippocampus [F(2, 62) = 0.73, P = 0.49] or with total brain volume
[F(2, 63) = 0.90, P = 0.41] for any model. Accounting for body fat
percentage or BMI did not change these relationships (Tables S3
and S4), and similar effects were observed in an analysis restricted
to non-Hispanic white participants (Table S5).
Discussion
The present study examined the relationship between genetic risk
for obesity and reward-related brain structure and responses to real-
world food stimuli in children. Consistent with previous studies,
we observed significant associations between the FTO rs9939609
polymorphism and BMI, as well as with adiposity. Independent of
current obesity status, genetic risk for obesity was associated with
both heightened responsivity to food commercials and larger vol-
umes within the NAcc, a region prominently associated with reward
processing. Importantly, we used a naturalistic paradigm that closely
mimics what children are likely to encounter in a real-world setting,
offering insight into the factors that contribute to real-world eating
behaviors. The observed reward responsivity to food cues, in con-
cert with greater structural volume, may provide a mechanism by
which genetically at-risk individuals are more susceptible to engage
in unhealthy eating behaviors early in life, a problem that could
contribute to obesity throughout the lifespan.
These findings extend prior studies that have begun to identify
relationships between neural responses to food cues in adults and
the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism. In particular, studies have dem-
onstrated heightened responsivity to food cues in regions associated
with reward (e.g., the putamen) in adults at risk for obesity (14), as
well as a modulatory role of FTO on the relationship between neural
responses to food and circulating acyl-ghrelin (16). Furthermore, one
recent study identified both structural and functional differences in
the posterior fusiform gyrus associated with genetic risk for obesity
(15), and another observed relationships between FTO rs9939609
and activity in the precuneus and cuneus (14). The whole-brain ex-
ploratory analysis reported here (Fig. 3A) did not replicate pre-
viously reported effects in adults. Moreover, none of these prior
studies in adults reported effects in the ventral striatum of the kind
that we observed in children, either because these effects were not
present (14, 16) or the effects were not examined (15). As such, it is
difficult to reconcile the current findings in children with those
previously reported in adults. The differences between the present
study and prior investigations may be attributable to population
differences (i.e., children versus adults), paradigm differences (i.e.,
commercial videos of food versus static images of food), or statistical
power given the relatively small sample sizes across studies (21). It is
worth noting, however, that even within the cohorts of adults tested
previously, there is little consistency in reported effects across stud-
ies. Moreover, with one exception (14), none of the prior work links
FTO genotypic differences to neural differences in canonical reward

 regions despite the fact that previous studies have demonstrated a
causal role of FTO in regulating dopaminergic transmission (12) and
also in modulating mesocorticolimbic circuitry in adults (13). The ef-
fects reported here in children in ventral striatum function and struc-
ture, as well as the voxel-wise whole-brain exploratory analysis,
constrain the FTO genotypic differences to canonical reward neuro-
circuitry. To highlight the overlap, Fig. 3B (22) depicts the results of an
automated, large-scale meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies using text
mining (23) on the term “reward.” Although these investigations (in-
cluding the present study) suggest that responses to food cues are al-
tered in individuals at risk for obesity, future studies are needed to
address these discrepancies and elucidate the impact of FTO rs9939609
on neural responses to food and perhaps other appetitive cues.
Although the current study presents initial evidence supporting a
relationship between FTO and reward system structure and function,
several limitations warrant caution in interpreting these findings.
First, longitudinal studies are clearly needed to fully understand the
relationship between FTO and brain development. For example, a
recent study in older adults (70–82 years old) observed that the
FTO risk allele was associated with lower NAcc volume (24). One
possibility may be that the FTO gene influences the rate of neural
development in reward-related structures during childhood as well as
neural atrophy of these structures during late adulthood. Future
studies should address the relationship between FTO and brain
structure across the lifespan.
Second, previous studies have largely supported an additive effect
of variants in FTO on obesity metrics (e.g., BMI) (1, 11, 25–27).
More recent reports, however, have argued in support of exploring
nonadditive models of obesity-associated genes (e.g., dominant,
recessive) (28). Consistent with this idea, the present study observed
a recessive model best predicted BMI and percent body fat, whereas
a dominant model best predicted reward-related structure and
functional responses to food cues. The critical difference among
these genetic models is the relationship with heterozygous individ-
uals. Here, children genotyped as heterozygous (i.e., AT) for the
FTO rs9939609 polymorphism exhibited a dissociation between
anthropometric (e.g., BMI) and neural phenotypes. These individ-
uals demonstrated strongest similarity to the low-risk group (TT) in
that they were not overweight or obese, yet their NAcc volumes and
food cue-responsivity were statistically more similar to the high-risk
(AA) individuals. The neural similarities between these genotypic
groups suggest that the high-risk A allele may affect reward-related
areas of the brain before anthropometric differentiation. In this
way, an individual’s obesity status may not independently drive re-
ward-related responses to food cues; rather, these signals may ad-
ditionally depend on dopaminergic reward pathways influenced by
an individual’s genetic background. Furthermore, these pathways
may be more sensitive during childhood. Developmental evidence
suggests that the ventral striatum matures earlier than prefrontal
regions associated with self-control (7). Thus, childhood may rep-
resent a critical period for establishing reward-related circuitry
motivating appetitive behaviors. In addition to implications for brain
development, this distinction may in part explain the differences
observed in the present study in comparison with prior FTO
neuroimaging studies conducted in adults.
Although speculative, one possibility is that FTO may influence the
development of reward system circuitry, such that this system matures
earlier in higher-risk than low-risk individuals. When combined with
slowly maturing control systems, the effect of the higher-risk geno-
types may serve to open a time window during which enhanced re-
ward signals reinforce and maintain unhealthy eating habits early in
life. Future studies will need to consider longitudinal approaches to
investigating the role of brain development on the interaction be-
tween genetic and environmental factors associated with obesity.
Third, the sample size reported here may be underpowered to fully
capture all relationships between the FTO genotype and brain struc-
ture and function. More specifically, the neural effects observed here
are driven by differences between a sample of 22 low-risk participants
(TT genotype) relative to 56 at-risk participants (AT and AA geno-
types). Button et al. (21) argued that studies reporting significant ef-
fects using low sample sizes or low statistical power are less likely to
detect true effects and may also overestimate the likelihood that ob-
served effects are true (false positives) and their associated effect sizes
accurate. In their analyses, the median statistical power for more than
450 neuroimaging studies was 8%. In contrast, the effect sizes
reported here were moderate to large, with post-hoc statistical power
ranging from 60 to 91%. That said, future work replicating these
findings in larger sample sizes will still be needed in addition to studies
that examine FTO gene effects across the lifespan.
Fourth, the present study did not observe any relationships be-
tween NAcc responsivity and BMI status in children. This finding,
however, is consistent with our prior work in another pediatric
population using an identical behavioral paradigm (17). Instead, the
literature has demonstrated a relationship between ventral striatum
activity and short-term measures of eating behavior [e.g., real-world
food temptation (4), short-term weight gain (3), and snack con-
sumption (29)]. Although these motivated behaviors (i.e., eating)
may lead to obesity over time, this may not be reflected in our
previous (17) and current studies because children have limited
autonomy and their diets can be highly influenced by the foods that
their adult caregivers provide and rules around food that their
caregivers enforce (30). Put simply, neural responsivity to food cues
may have a greater influence on BMI later in life when individuals
are more independent in deciding what and how much they eat.
Finally, the collinearity between body mass and FTO rs9939609
creates additional challenges when attempting to link the FTO ge-
notype to brain responses. Prior work has shown that variants in
FTO correlate with BMI (1) and that BMI (and other adiposity
measures such as percent body fat) is correlated with brain activity
(17, 31, 32). Although prior reports have used adiposity-matched

(15)] and consistent with the ROI results, AT and AA genotypes were combined
and compared with the low-risk TT individuals. In doing so, a single cluster (k =
308 voxels) was more responsive to food commercials (relative to nonfood
commercials) in children at risk for obesity (AT and AA) than low-risk children
(TT). The peak of this cluster was observed in the medial portion of the orbito-
frontal cortex (MNI coordinates: −3, 27, −15) and extended posteriorly into the
bilateral ventral striatum (P < 0.05, cluster corrected). (B) For comparison, a

 participants to explore the effect of FTO on neural responses (16),
we aimed to circumvent this issue by controlling for BMI (or adi-
posity) to isolate independent contributions of the FTO genotype.
Furthermore, we observed neural differences between at-risk het-
erozygous (AT) and low-risk homozygous (TT) individuals, although
no statistical differences existed in BMI or adiposity between these
two groups. Collectively, these results suggest that increases in body
mass were insufficient to account for or mediate the neural associ-
ations with FTO rs9939609. However, recent studies have pointed to
regulatory mechanisms of FTO on adipocyte thermogenesis (33),
suggesting the possibility that FTO influences adiposity levels before
exerting an effect on the brain. The mechanisms underlying the re-
lationship between FTO and obesity are likely to be complex and
involve multiple layers and potential interactions among physiological
and neurological signals. Future studies may be in a stronger position
to address this potential confound by directly matching participants
based on anthropometric measurements, such as BMI, as in, for
example, ref. 16.
Taking these data together, the present study extends prior liter-
ature targeting associations between reward-related brain structures
and body mass/adiposity by demonstrating a role of genetic risk for
obesity. Here we report that children at a greater genetic risk for
obesity exhibit heightened reward responses to naturalistic food cues
in the NAcc, as well as larger overall NAcc volumes. In addition, we
observed a phenotypic distinction between anthropometric
and neural measures, suggesting that normal weight children may be
genetically predisposed to overeating through an overactive reward
system. Overall, these findings may inform future investigations of
genetic influences on the neural mechanisms underlying overeating
and obesity by providing preliminary evidence for the association
between FTO rs9939609 and reward-related regions of the brain.
Methods
Participants. Seventy-eight children (42 male) between the ages of 9 and 12 [mean
(SD) = 10.3 (0.8) y] were recruited by phone based on participation in a previous
study conducted in our laboratory. In this initial study, 200 children were recruited
through community fliers and a contact list from the Children’s Hospital at
Dartmouth. Participants in the present study were all right-handed, native English
speakers, reported normal neurological history, and had normal or corrected-to-
normal visual acuity. Each subject provided informed consent in accordance with
the guidelines set by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at
Dartmouth College and received monetary compensation for participating.
Of the 78 scanned participants, 19 were homozygous high-risk for the FTO
genotype (AA), 37 were heterozygous (AT), and 22 were homozygous low-risk (TT)
(Table S1). The distribution of participants was consistent with the Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium (χ2 test P value = 0.66). Mean BMI and body fat percentages (SD) were
19.3 (4.3) and 20.1 (8.9), respectively. Two participants (one AA, one AT) were
excluded from the fMRI analysis because of excessive movement throughout
the scan. Eight participants were excluded from the sMRI analysis because of low
signal-to-noise ratios (lower than one SD from the mean) in addition to two that
did not pass visual inspection. Of the 76 and 68 participants included in the
functional and structural analyses, respectively, mean age, BMI, and body fat
percentages did not significantly differ from the full (n = 78) sample. Based on
parental report, participants were 85.9% white and non-Hispanic, 1.3% white and
Hispanic, and 5.1% unknown race and Hispanic, with the remainder (7.7%) being
non-white and non-Hispanic. Because previously reported associations between
the FTO genotype and obesity-related phenotypes are commonly observed
across populations with divergent ancestral origins (34, 35), we conducted a
sensitivity analysis restricted to non-Hispanic white participants to account for
potential confounding by population stratification (36).
FTO Genotype. Buccal cell swabs were collected and stored at room temperature
with desiccant capsules (Isohelix). DNA was isolated using DDK-50 isolation kits
(Isohelix). Genotyping for FTO rs9939609 was conducted with real-time PCR and
Taqman chemistry using the 7500 Fast real-time instrument (primers and in-
strument from Thermo Fisher Scientific). All samples were successfully genotyped
and there was 100% genotyping consistency among the 10% blinded replicates.
BMI and Percent Body Fat. Participants were measured under the guise that our
MRI scanner required precise height and weight information, thereby keeping
subjects naive to the study purpose. Participants’ heights were measured using a
professional-grade stadiometer, and weights measured on a Tanita scale (model
TBF-300A). This scale additionally computed percentage body fat via bioelectrical
impedance analysis. BMI was calculated based on participants’ height and weight.
Stimuli. Six minutes of food (n = 15) and 6 min of nonfood (n = 13) commercials
were matched for total duration (mean food commercial = 22.5 s; mean nonfood
commercial = 22.4 s) and embedded as four “commercial breaks” into an episode
of an age-appropriate and gender-neutral television show, Nickelodeon’s Figure it
Out. Nonfood commercials were included as a comparison stimulus to account for
low-level visual properties inherent to processing dynamic scenes. Commercials
were selected based on quality, recency, and relevance to the age group. To
control for differential effects of likeability or salience between food and non-
food conditions, a separate cohort of 24 children [mean (SD) age = 11.3 (0.83) y]
rated pseudorandomized subsets of commercials for interest (i.e., “How in-
teresting was this commercial?”) and excitement (i.e., “How exciting was this
commercial?”). Overall, food and nonfood commercials did not differ in interest
[t(26) = 0.55; P = 0.59] or excitement [t(26) = 0.07; P = 0.94] ratings.
Scanning Paradigm. All participants were scanned between the 1530 and 1730
hours to control for differential responses to food related to time of day. Partici-
pants were asked not to eat for 2 h before the study session to collect a buccal swab
for DNA isolation. Because of this, participants were provided with a standardized
snack (Nature’s Valley granola bar) before the scan to ensure that neural responses
were not specific to hunger. All participants either consumed the snack or
reported not feeling hungry before the scan. During scanning, commercials were
presented using PsychoPy v1.80 (37) in pseudorandomized order so that no more
than three commercials of the same condition and no two commercials of the
same brand were presented in a row. A fixation cross (2.5–15 s) was presented in-
between individual commercials. Although functional scans were not acquired
during television viewing, a fixation cross was also randomly presented during the
show for consistency. Consistent with our cover story, a set of questions about the
television show (including commercials) were asked after the scan, allowing us to
verify that participants were attentive throughout the entire duration of the scan.
The average correct response rate was 84.7% (SD = 0.11), suggesting that par-
ticipants were attentive throughout the scanning session.
Image Acquisition. Scanning was performed on a 3T Philips Achieve MRI fit with a
32-channel SENSE (Sensitivity Encoding) headcoil. Structural images were obtained
using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE)
protocol [repetition time (TR) = 9.9 ms; echo time (TE) = 4.6 ms; flip angle = 8°; 1 ×
1 × 1-mm3 voxels]. Functional images were acquired using a T2*-weighted echo
planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2,500 ms; TE = 35 ms; flip angle = 90°; 3 × 3 ×
3-mm3 voxels; sense factor of 2). Four functional runs were collected (105 TRs each)
for each participant.
Functional Image Preprocessing. All functional image preprocessing and sub-
sequent analyses were conducted in SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive
Neurology)in conjunction with a suite of tools available for preprocessing and fMRI
analyses (https://github.com/ddwagner/SPM8w). Functional images were slice
time-corrected and realigned to account for variability because of head motion.
Quality assurance analysis was performed to identify scanning runs with sub-
stantial head movement. Any run that included a minimum of seven TRs of 1-mm
displacement (one SD above the mean across all participants) was excluded from
further analysis. As a result, partial data were included for 16 participants (75%
for 9 subjects, 50% for 7 subjects). Resulting images were normalized to the
MNI-152 template (Montreal Neurological Institute) and spatially smoothed using
a 6 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel.
Structural Image Preprocessing. Structural images were reconstructed using
FreeSurfer, an automated segmentation tool that has been demonstrated to label
structures comparably to manual tracing techniques (20). Although visual in-
spection is commonly used to qualitatively examine the quality of structural MRI
data, more recent techniques have additionally allowed for quantitative mea-
surements of anatomical data quality (38, 39). To assess data quality in an un-
biased manner, Freesurfer’s QA tools (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/
QATools) were used to calculate signal-to-noise ratios for each subject as well as
to generate a series of screenshots taken from various steps throughout the
reconstruction pipeline. Structural images that were one SD below the sample
mean [17.1 (SD = 2.6)] or that did not pass standard visual inspection were ex-
cluded from the analysis shown in Fig. 2. Here, 10 participants were removed
from this analysis, leaving 68 high-quality anatomical images; however, the
observed effects were similar within the full sample (n = 78) (Fig. S1).

 ROI Analyses. For each subject, a general linear model was used to estimate the
contributions of food and nonfood commercials on neural activity across the
whole brain. Nuisance regressors included six motion parameters, the session
mean, and a linear trend to account for scanner drift. Responses to food com-
mercials were compared against nonfood commercials, and resulting parameter
estimates were extracted from probabilistic masks of the left and right NAcc.
These masks were anatomically defined in an independent sample of adolescents
used in a previous study (17), thus removing the possibility of circularity in our
analysis (40). Specifically, these masks were probabilistically defined based off of
75% of subjects contributing overlapping voxels to the group-level masks. For
structural analyses, estimates of NAcc volumes were extracted for each individual
subject using FreeSurfer (20). Left hippocampal volumes were additionally extracted
and used as a control region for comparison, similar to previous studies (41).
Functional and structural estimates of NAcc responses and volumes,
respectively, were assessed for differences by FTO genotype using a one-
way ANOVA. Planned contrasts were used to examine recessive (AA > AT
and TT), additive (AA > AT > TT), and dominant (AA and AT > TT) models
of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism. Structural analyses included esti-
mated intracranial volume as a covariate of no interest to account for
overall differences in brain volume. All statistical analyses were performed
with and without the inclusion of BMI or percentage body fat (in addition
to age and gender) to account for potential effects related to body weight
or adiposity (Tables S3 and S4).
Multiple Comparisons Correction. To account for the known collinearity among
additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models in addition to potentially col-
linear measurements (e.g., left and right NAcc structure and function), a stringent
approach was used to correct for the detection of false-positive associations (i.e.,
type I errors). The pairwise correlations (Pearson’s r) between all measurements
reported throughout the report were computed, producing an 18 × 18 [three
genetic models × (two anthropometric variables + four neural variables)]
correlation matrix. This matrix represents the linkage disequilibrium among the
genetic phenotypes and was used to determine the number of independent tests
(Meff) via spectral decomposition software (gump.qimr.edu.au/general/daleN/
matSpD). The resulting Meff value was then used to determine the significance
threshold (α) based on �
Sidák correction (42) as well as Bonferroni correction (43).
The difference between the �
Sidák- and Bonferroni-corrected α was negligible
(0.0002) and produced equivalent interpretations of significant results. Thus, �
Sidák
correction was used here because of its relevance for genetic models and prev-
alence in the literature; however, alternative correction procedures [e.g., false-
discovery rate (FDR) correction, Bonferroni using Meff] are reported in SI Text.
Exploratory Whole-Brain Analysis. In addition to ROI analyses targeting the NAcc,
an exploratory whole-brain analysis was performed to facilitate comparison with
prior neuroimaging studies on the influence of the FTO gene on the brain.
Whole-brain contrast maps comparing food commercials to nonfood commer-
cials were used as input into a between-subjects group-level analysis comparing
at-risk individuals to low-risk individuals. At-risk individuals included both AT and
AA individuals (n = 54), consistent with previous analyses (e.g., ref. 15). Low-risk
individuals included TT genotyped individuals only (n = 22). The resulting
voxelwise group-level map was thresholded at P < 0.05 and cluster-corrected
at P < 0.05 based on 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations.
