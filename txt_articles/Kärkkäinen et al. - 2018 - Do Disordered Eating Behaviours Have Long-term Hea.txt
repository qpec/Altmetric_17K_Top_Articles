Abstract
Objective—Long-term health-related consequences of disordered eating behaviors of young 
adults remain poorly understood. We examined whether disordered eating behaviors in mid-
twenties are associated with physical and mental health ten years later.
Methods—Women (N=2,631) and men (N=2,394) from a population-based FinnTwin16 cohort 
were assessed using three subscales of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 at age 24. Self-rated 
health, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and psychological distress were assessed at 
age 24 and reassessed ten years later.
Results—In crude models, disordered eating behaviors at age 24 were associated cross-
sectionally and prospectively with poor self-rated health, higher BMI, larger waist circumference 
and psychological distress in both sexes. In models adjusted for baseline BMI and potential 
confounders, disordered eating behaviors predicted increased psychological distress in both sexes, 
and poor self-rated health in men.
Conclusions—Among young adults, disordered eating behaviors are associated with long-term 
health-related consequences, particularly psychological distress.

 Wade, Wilksch & Lee 2012, McBride et al. 2013). In practice, the threshold between normal 
and disordered eating is difficult to define (Ackard, Fulkerson & Neumark-Sztainer 2007). 
For this reason, continuous measures such as Eating Disorder Inventory-2 are useful tools 
for measuring disordered eating behaviors in the population (Keel et al. 2007, Nurkkala et al. 
2016).
Disordered eating symptoms tend to track from adolescence to adulthood (Steinhausen, 
Gavez & Winkler Metzke 2005, Neumark-Sztainer et al. 2011, Liechty, Lee 2013, Ackard, 
Fulkerson & Neumark-Sztainer 2011). Disordered eating in adolescence is associated with 
various adverse health outcomes. Among adolescents disordered eating is associated with 
higher BMI and increased weight gain (Neumark-Sztainer et al. 2012, Neumark-Sztainer et 
al. 2006, Rancourt, McCullough 2015), but also with several mental health problems 
(Herpertz-Dahlmann et al. 2008, Steinhausen, Gavez & Winkler Metzke 2005, Stein et al. 
2013) and reduced quality of life (Herpertz-Dahlmann et al. 2008).
Much less is known about disordered eating behaviors among adults, but community survey 
indicates that the prevalence of such behaviors may be increasing (Hay et al. 2008). In a 
cross-sectional population study, disordered eating behaviors have shown to indicate 
increased risk for mental health comorbidities also among adults (McBride et al. 2013). 
Only few longitudinal studies have shown that disordered eating behavior is associated with 
increased body weight (Stein et al. 2013), and decreased physical and mental quality of life 
(Wade, Wilksch & Lee 2012, Fairweather-Schmidt, Lee & Wade 2015). However, these few 
longitudinal studies included only women, even though eating disorder behaviors are 
common also among men (Keel et al. 2007, Hay et al. 2008).
Existing studies have mainly focused on adolescents and women. Less is known about the 
long-term consequences of disordered eating in adulthood, particularly among men. The 
impact of disordered eating on general health also remains poorly understood. We explored 
whether disordered eating behaviors as measured by three subscales of the Eating Disorder 
Inventory 2 (EDI-2) are associated with long-term physical and mental health in young adult 
women and men. Specifically, we assessed how disordered eating behaviors in mid-twenties 
are associated with self-rated health, BMI, waist circumference and psychological distress 
cross-sectionally and prospectively after ten years of follow-up.
Materials and methods
Participants
The participants for this study were identified from FinnTwin16, a nationwide longitudinal 
study of Finnish twins born between October 1974 and December 1979 identified from the 
Central Population Registry of Finland (Kaprio, Pulkkinen & Rose 2002). The self-report 
questionnaires addressed various health behaviors (Kaprio 2013). Because the EDI subscales 
were first included at wave 4, analyses reported in this study are based on information 
collected at wave 4 (mean age 24.4, range: 22–27) and 10 years later at wave 5 (mean age 
34.1, range: 31–37). The study was conducted according to the standards of the Declaration 
of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the Central Finland Hospital

Exclusions and attrition
At age 24, from the 2,835 female and 2,423 male responders we excluded participants 
whose information on weight or height was missing (n=22 women and 24 men) and 
participants with any eating disorder (n=182 women and 5 men). Analyses at age 24 were 
conducted using 2,631 women and 2,394 men (mean age 24.4, range: 22–27).
Ten years later, information on weight and height without any eating disorder was available 
from 2,035 women and 1,670 men (mean age 34.1, range: 31–37). The overall attrition rate 
between data collection at ages 24 and 34 was 26.8%; see below for an attrition analysis.
Measurements
Disordered eating behaviors—Disordered eating behaviors were assessed at age 24 
using three subscales of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2) questionnaire: Body 
Dissatisfaction, Drive for Thinness, and Bulimia. These three subscales were chosen because 
they measure behaviors and cognitions directly related to disordered eating, whereas the 
other EDI-2 subscales focus on other aspects of psychological and social functioning. Each 
individual item in the subscales was scored using 6-point Likert scoring (1-2-3-4-5-6) and 
the EDI-2 global score was calculated as the sum of all three subscales.
Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist circumference—BMI was calculated from self-
reported weight and height. For assessment of waist circumference, subjects were sent a tape 
measure along with illustrated instructions. BMI and waist circumference were measured at 
age 24 and ten years later. In a validation sample (Saarni et al. 2009), the agreement between 
actual measurements taken on average 2 years later and self-report from the questionnaire at 
age 24 was high. The interclass correlation for BMI was 0.89 (mean difference was 0.93 
kg/m2) and 0.75 for waist circumference (mean difference was 2.48 cm). We used the 
standard World Health Organization definitions of ‘underweight’ (BMI <19.5 kg/m2), 
‘normal weight’ (BMI 19.5–24.9 kg/m2), ‘overweight’ (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2) and ‘obesity’ 
(BMI> 29.9 kg/m2).
Self-rated health and psychological distress—Self-rated health was assessed at age 
24 and ten years later. Participants rated their current health as ‘excellent’, ‘rather good’, 
‘fair’, ‘rather poor’, or ‘very poor’. Psychological distress was also assessed at age 24 and 
ten years later. It was measured with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) 
(Goldberg et al. 1997) using four-point Likert scoring (0-1-2-3), with the sum score ranging 
from 0 to 36.
Statistical analyses
We described our study sample characteristics using means and 95% confidence intervals 
(95% CI) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical measures. We used 
Pearson’s χ2 test, Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance to test for sex 
differences. Testing the associations between disordered eating behaviors and health

 outcomes included the following steps. First, we tested crude associations between 
disordered eating behaviors at age 24 and self-rated health, BMI, waist circumference and 
psychological distress a) cross-sectionally at age 24 and b) prospectively at age 34 with 
Spearman’s correlation. Second, we used ordinary least-square linear regression to 
longitudinally examine whether disordered eating behaviors at age 24 predicted the 
aforementioned health outcomes at age 34 after controlling for factors at age 24. Therefore, 
in our ‘baseline-controlled models’, we controlled for the values of each outcome at age 24. 
For example, the association of disordered eating behaviors at age 24 with BMI at age 34 
was controlled for BMI at age 24. Finally, in our ‘fully controlled models’ we took into 
account all potential confounders; self-rated health, BMI, waist circumference, 
psychological distress and education at age 24. We tested all models for multicollinearity by 
examining variance inflation factors. Continuous variables were standardized. Analyses 
were adjusted for correlated observations within twin pairs and no within-pair analyses were 
conducted. All analyses were conducted using the statistical software package Stata 14.0 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
Attrition analysis
Before conducting the analyses, we examined attrition. Our study spanned a period of ten 
years: 26.8% of our respondents (23.3% of women and 30.9% of men) were lost to follow-
up. In attrition analyses, participants responding at follow-up did not differ from non-
responders with respect to disordered eating behaviors, self-rated health, BMI, waist 
circumference or psychological distress. Women with children were more likely to be lost to 
follow-up. In both sexes, respondents at age 34 were significantly more educated, were more 
likely to live in an urban area and less likely to smoke (full attrition analysis available from 
the author upon request). In conclusion, we did not find significant differences in key 
variables between participants and non-participants in this study.
Results
Characteristics at age 24
The characteristics of our participants in their mid-twenties are presented in Table 1. As 
previously reported, women on average weighted 61 kg and men 77 kg, and their mean 
BMIs were 22.2 and 23.9, respectively (Table 1) (Kärkkäinen et al. 2016). Waist 
circumference was on average 75 cm among women and 85 cm among men. At age 24, 11% 
of women and 25% of men were overweight, and 4% of women and 4% of men met criteria 
of obesity.
The distributions of EDI-2 scores among women and men are shown in Figure 1 and mean 
values and their confidence intervals in Table 1. The majority of the participants reported 
their self-rated health to be rather good or excellent at age 24; only 17% of women and 14% 
of men reported their self-rated health to be fair, rather poor, or very poor. The mean 
GHQ-12 score, measuring psychological distress, was 11.2 (SD 5.4, range 0–36) for women 
and 9.8 (SD 4.7, range 0–36) for men at age 24.

 Health-related outcomes at follow-up
Over the follow-up period, women gained on average 5 kg and men 6 kg, resulting in a mean 
BMI gain of 1.8 (SD 1.7–1.9) and 1.9 (SD 1.8–2.1), respectively. Waist circumference 
increased by 6.5 cm (SD 6.0–6.9) in women and 7.1 cm (SD 6.6–7.5) in men. At age 34, the 
majority was at good health, but 20% of women and 19% of men rated their self-rated health 
as fair, rather poor, or very poor. At follow-up, the mean GHQ scores did not differ from 
mean GHQ scores at age 24 for either sex.
Associations of disordered eating behaviors with weight and well-being
In unadjusted, cross-sectional analyses, disordered eating behaviors at age 24 were strongly 
associated with poor self-rated health, BMI, waist circumference and psychological distress 
in both sexes (Figure 2). Moreover, disordered eating behaviors at age 24 were associated 
with these health-related outcomes ten years later (Figure 2).
Prediction of future health-related outcomes
Women—In ‘baseline-controlled models’, disordered eating behaviors at age 24 were 
significant predictors of all health-related outcomes ten years later (Table 2, Baseline-
controlled models). In these models, we controlled for the values of each outcome at age 24. 
For example, the association of disordered eating behaviors at age 24 with BMI at age 34 
was controlled for BMI at age 24.
However, when we controlled for additional characteristics at age 24 (self-rated health, BMI, 
waist circumference, psychological distress and education), disordered eating behaviors 
predicted only increased psychological distress at age 34 in women (Table 2, Fully 
controlled models).
Men—In men, too, disordered eating behaviors at age 24 were significant predictors of all 
health-related outcomes at age 34 in ‘baseline-controlled models’ (Table 3, Baseline-
controlled models). In the ‘fully controlled models’, disordered eating behaviors at age 24 
were associated with both increased psychological distress and poor self-rated health ten 
years later (Table 3, Fully controlled models).
Discussion
According to this longitudinal community-based study, disordered eating behaviors have 
long-term health-related consequences among young adults. We found that disordered eating 
behaviors in young adults were associated with worse physical and psychological well-being 
cross-sectionally and prospectively. After controlling for BMI and other potential 
confounders, disordered eating in young adulthood predicted increased psychological 
distress in both sexes and poor self-rated health among men ten years later.
Our results confirm and extend findings from previous studies. Disordered eating behaviors 
have been shown to be associated with several mental health problems both among 
adolescent girls and boys (Herpertz-Dahlmann et al. 2008, Steinhausen, Gavez & Winkler 
Metzke 2005) and cross-sectionally among women and men (McBride et al. 2013). A cross-

 sectional association between disordered eating and poor self-rated health has been observed 
earlier among young Finnish men (Nurkkala et al. 2016). Yet, we are aware of only two 
longitudinal studies investigating the psychological and physical well-being of adult women 
with disordered eating behaviors. Both studies found a longstanding association between 
disordered eating and decreased mental and physical quality of life among young and 
middle-aged women (Wade, Wilksch & Lee 2012, Fairweather-Schmidt, Lee & Wade 2015). 
Our study is in line with these findings. To our knowledge, this is also the first study to show 
that disordered eating behaviors prospectively predict psychological distress and poor self-
rated health also among young men.
Even though the association between disordered eating and weight gain appears to be strong 
in adolescence (Neumark-Sztainer et al. 2012, Neumark-Sztainer et al. 2006, Rancourt, 
McCullough 2015, Sonneville et al. 2013), we did not find disordered eating behaviors to 
predict weight gain in young adults. Factors other than disordered eating seem to explain 
weight gain during young adulthood. However, given that disordered eating behaviors and 
BMI were strongly associated cross-sectionally at age 24, it is likely that weight 
development before this age is connected to these behaviors. Future studies should 
investigate the causal relationships and timing between disordered eating behaviors and 
weight gain during the transition from adolescence to adulthood.
Our study shows that disordered eating behaviors among young adults are not without 
consequences. Disordered eating behaviors predict increased psychological distress and poor 
self-rated health in the future. In addition to being a source of suffering on its own, 
psychological distress predicts physical morbidity (Winning et al. 2015, Puustinen et al. 
2011, Chida et al. 2008). According to a large meta-analysis, even low levels of 
psychological distress are associated with increased mortality from several major causes 
(Russ et al. 2012). Similarly, self-rated health is a powerful predictor of morbidity, mortality, 
and clinical outcome in a wide range of conditions (Idler & Benyamini 1997, Fayers & 
Sprangers 2002). Self-rated health also predicts future health expenditures (DeSalvo et al. 
2009). Against this background, individuals with subclinical disordered eating behaviors 
might benefit from early identification along with targeted interventions to prevent the 
development of mental and physical health problems.
A possible factor influencing the relationship between disordered eating and health is 
physical activity. Physical activity is important for general health and well-being 
(Kuykendall, Tay & Ng 2015, Warburton, Nicol & Bredin 2006), but disordered eating 
behaviors may contribute to unhealthy physical activity behaviors (Lichtenstein et al. 2017, 
Nurkkala et al. 2016) that may have negative health consequences. Future studies should 
explore the long-term relationship between physical activity and disordered eating behaviors 
to understand their joint effects on health and well-being.
Limitations and strengths—Our study was limited in several ways. First, loss to follow-
up could have caused bias; attrition was 23% among women and 31% among men. Yet, we 
did not find evidence of selective attrition in respect to our main outcomes. Second, all 
variables were self-reported, which may cause reporting bias. However, self-reported BMI 
has previously been shown to correlate closely with measured BMI in a subsample of this

 cohort (Mustelin et al. 2009). Third, our outcome measures did not include physical 
morbidity and the follow-up was too short to assess impact on mortality. Instead, we focused 
on intermediate health-related outcomes such as BMI, self-rated health and psychological 
distress. Yet, BMI predicts of healthy and disease-free life expectancy among adults 
(Stenholm et al. 2017) and self-rated health and psychological distress predict future health 
status (Winning et al. 2015, Puustinen et al. 2011, Chida et al. 2008, Russ et al. 2012, Idler, 
Benyamini 1997, Fayers, Sprangers 2002, DeSalvo et al. 2009).
The weaknesses outlined above were counterbalanced by several strengths. Our study was 
nationwide, population-based, and included both women and men with excellent 
participation rates. Our follow-up time was ten years, adequate to address meaningful 
associations of disordered eating behaviors with health-related consequences over young 
adulthood. In addition, the last wave of data collection took place recently: thus, our findings 
are topical and relevant. Although few previous authors have addressed the long-term health-
related consequences of disordered eating behaviors among women (Stein et al. 2013, Wade, 
Wilksch & Lee 2012, Fairweather-Schmidt, Lee & Wade 2015), we are not aware of other 
nationwide longitudinal studies that are informative about health-related consequences of 
disordered eating behaviors in both sexes.
Conclusions
Disordered eating behaviors appear to have longstanding adverse consequences for mental 
health and well-being among young women and men. Future studies should evaluate 
strategies for prevention of health problems among these individuals.
