Abstract
Background: There is increasing recognition of the therapeutic function pets can play in relation to mental health.
However, there has been no systematic review of the evidence related to the comprehensive role of companion
animals and how pets might contribute to the work associated with managing a long-term mental health
condition. The aim of this study was to explore the extent, nature and quality of the evidence implicating the role
and utility of pet ownership for people living with a mental health condition.
Methods: A systematic search for studies exploring the role of companion animals in the management of mental
health conditions was undertaken by searching 9 databases and undertaking a scoping review of grey literature
from the earliest record until March 2017. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be published in English and
report on primary data related to the relationship between domestic animal ownership and the management of
diagnosable mental health conditions. Synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken in parallel
using a narrative synthesis informed by an illness work theoretical framework.
Results: A total of 17 studies were included in the review. Quantitative evidence relating to the benefits of pet
ownership was mixed with included studies demonstrating positive, negative and neutral impacts of pet
ownership. Qualitative studies illuminated the intensiveness of connectivity people with companion animals
reported, and the multi-faceted ways in which pets contributed to the work associated with managing a mental
health condition, particularly in times of crisis. The negative aspects of pet ownership were also highlighted,
including the practical and emotional burden of pet ownership and the psychological impact that losing a pet has.
Conclusion: This review suggests that pets provide benefits to those with mental health conditions. Further
research is required to test the nature and extent of this relationship, incorporating outcomes that cover the range
of roles and types of support pets confer in relation to mental health and the means by which these can be
incorporated into the mainstay of support for people experiencing a mental health problem.

 Background
The rise in people experiencing a mental health problem
[1] and the identification of mental illness as the leading
cause of disability adjusted life years globally (DALYs) [2, 3]
requires concerted effort in identifying and mobilising
resources to support people living with a mental health
problem. Traditional approaches to the self-management
of long-term conditions focus on psychological mecha-
nisms of behaviour change, which have been shown to
have some utility for managing symptoms. However, these
approaches often fail to take into account the wider
resources including material and social relationships in
people’s domestic and local environments which form the
latent and constituent part of systems of lay and commu-
nity support [4]. These are increasingly being recognised as
holding significant relevance for the management of long-
term health conditions [5]. Indication of the potential
benefit that pets convey to the experience of mental health
comes from evidence detailing the benefits of pet owner-
ship in relation to stress reduction, improved quality of life,
and pets as promoters of social and community interaction
[6–8]. Recent work has shed light on the relevance of pets
in the social networks of people who have received a diag-
nosis of a severe and enduring mental health illness (e.g.
Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder) [9] suggesting that
pets can be considered alongside other human relation-
ships. However, the evidence base for the benefit of pet
ownership for those with diagnosable mental health condi-
tions is fragmented and unclear.
The enduring relationship between humans and domestic
animals is well documented and there are an estimated 10
million cats (23% of households with one or more cat) and
11.5 million dogs (30% of households with one or more
dog) kept as pets in the UK [10], with similar rates of own-
ership found across Europe, Australia, China and Japan
[11]. Despite this phenomenon, the potential benefits that
owning a pet might confer specifically to mental health has
received relatively little attention. Research has focused on
formalised animal contact in closed settings such as Animal
Assisted Therapy (AAT). Multiple reviews have considered
AAT in a variety of fields including intellectual disability
[12], autism [13], general healthcare [14, 15] and neuro-
rehabilitation [16, 17], but there are no systematic syntheses
of the role and effects of the less structured animal contact
provided by pet ownership in open settings for people with
mental health conditions. The provision of ongoing support
in normalised everyday settings remains an aspiration of
mental health policy but the mapping of the nature of re-
sources available and how they are, and can be, deployed
remains underexplored.
Underlying theoretical framework
This review draws on a framework of long-term condi-
tion ‘work’ informed by Corbin and Strauss [18] which
was developed in the context of exploring the contribu-
tion and division of labour provided by intimate and
weak ties in personal communities in relation to living
with a long term condition [4, 5, 19, 20]. This approach
allows for an in-depth analysis of the role of pets in rela-
tion to the tasks that need to be done to manage mental
health in the context of people’s everyday lives to con-
solidate the evidence base in this regard. Practical work
consists of tasks undertaken by network members which
are practical in orientation and includes general practical
activities such as housekeeping, personal care and diet
and exercise activities but also illness specific practical
tasks such as taking medication, understanding symp-
toms, making appointments and preventative work to
avoid crises. Emotional work relates to wellbeing, pro-
viding companionship and being a source of comfort
when worried about everyday matters or specific illness
matters. Biographical work relates to the tasks and gen-
eration of ontological security, required to retain a posi-
tive sense of identity and give life meaning again post
diagnosis. This involves assessments of personal expecta-
tions, capabilities, relationships and biographical events.
These types of work are distributed amongst weak as
well as close ties [21]. This framework has been used in
preference to more traditional notions of social support
as it allows for the inclusion of an in-depth understand-
ing of the open system resources, networks and relation-
ships that people draw on when managing a long-term
condition in their everyday lives [4]. The framework was
used to guide the narrative synthesis of the studies in-
cluded in the review.
This review aimed to explore the nature, extent and
quality of the evidence demonstrating the role of pet
ownership for people with mental health conditions.
Review questions
1. What is the nature, extent and quality of the
evidence demonstrating the role of pet ownership
for those with mental health conditions, with or
without comorbid physical health conditions?
2. What is currently known about the mechanisms
underlying any impact?
Methods
A comprehensive search of 9 electronic databases was
undertaken in March 2017. The methods and reporting
of the results of this systematic review are described ac-
cording to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines [22].
Eligibility criteria
The review sought to identify studies that reported pri-
mary data, which investigated the relationship between

 pet ownership and diagnosable mental health conditions.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in Table 1. All
participants in the sample had a diagnosable mental
health condition or mental health problems associated
with a diagnosed physical health condition. Papers were
excluded if it was unclear who the sample were and
could only be included if specific reference to diagnos-
able conditions was made.
Studies were not excluded by date of publication or
sample size. However, those that were not published in
the English language, were only published in abstract
form, or were not accessible via inter-library loan were
not included in this review.
Search strategy and data sources
Electronic database searches were undertaken in March
2017 from the earliest record to March 2017 using ASSIA,
CINAHL Plus, Embase, International Bibliography of the
Social Sciences, Medline, PsychInfo, Social Science Full
Text, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science. Grey lit-
erature sites were also searched including OpenGrey,
Index to Theses, Electronic Theses Online Services, The
Health and Social Care Information Centre Website and
the Association of Health Observatories Website.
The search strategy was organised around four key
areas: 1) Participants’ perspectives, 2) Pet ownership, 3)
Diagnosed mental health conditions or co-morbid men-
tal health related to long-term physical conditions and
4) impact of pets on mental health management. The
search strategy was informed by published reviews, dis-
cussion within the wider project team, consideration of
MeSH terms and the wider literature in the area of pet
ownership. HB piloted search terms in a number of da-
tabases with input from an information technology spe-
cialist. Papers identified through piloting were assessed
for additional terms, subject headings and key words
with the aim of further refining the search strategy. A
copy of the final search strategy is available from the
author. Within each PICO component agreed search terms
were combined using the Boolean operator ‘OR’ and across
components using ‘AND’. The search was adapted for the
individual databases and websites as required.
Review strategy
Search results were uploaded to Endnote before remov-
ing duplicates and exporting into the data management
software Covidence (https://www.Covidence.org). The
first stage of the review process involved single screening
at the level of title and abstract (see Table 1 for a list of
inclusion and exclusion criteria). An additional reviewer
independently reviewed all excluded references for valid-
ity purposes. Full texts of included articles were obtained
for the purposes of full text screening. Full texts were
screened for inclusion independently by two reviewers
and inclusion/exclusion conflicts were resolved by a
third reviewer. Acceptable concordance was predefined
at 90% [23]. A concordance rate of 93% was achieved at
first rating (29 exclusion/inclusion conflicts).
The reference lists of included papers were also manu-
ally searched for relevant papers. A Google Scholar alert
was created in February 2017 and stopped in August
2017, which did not identify any additional articles
for inclusion.
Data extraction
Electronic forms were created in Microsoft Excel for the
purpose of data extraction. Data was double extracted
independently by two authors who each extracted all
studies. Disagreement between extractors, which con-
sisted of mostly minor additional detail, was resolved by
consensus between authors.
The aim of the review was to explore the impact of
pet ownership on diagnosed mental health conditions
(or co-morbid mental health symptoms associated with
other long-term conditions). Where data was available
from quantitative and qualitative outcomes of mental
health, these were extracted along with data relating to
study design, included participants and other contextual
factors.
Quality assessment
Included articles were assessed for relevance by HB, KR
and AR and for quality by HB and KR using criteria
adapted from the Qualitative Research Review Guide-
lines - RATS and the Quantitative Assessment tool for

 Quantitative Studies [24]. Any disagreements were re-
solved by discussion between authors. The quality as-
sessment included assessment of potential bias in terms
of selection and response and the reliability and validity
of the methodology utilised. No study was excluded on
quality alone [25]. Studies were given one point for each
quality criteria the study met (see Additional files 1 and 2)
and this was used to guide the narrative synthesis of the
studies included in the review.
The quality assessment process generated an average
quality rating of 5.5 out of 10 for qualitative studies and
8.75 out of 10 for quantitative work (refer to Additional
files 1 and 2). There were no RCTs evaluating the impact
of pet ownership on diagnosed mental health conditions.
Data synthesis
A deductive, thematic synthesis approach was con-
structed collaboratively between two authors (HB, KR)
and the resultant analytical framework was elaborated
and checked by a third (AR). Quantitative and qualita-
tive data were synthesised and combined in parallel.
Primary findings in each study were coded in line with
the concepts of the networked work of illness manage-
ment identified above which identified a set of three
core types of work deployed by social network members
of
an
individual’s
personal
community
of
support
(practical, emotional and biographical work). We utilised
a constant comparative approach to analysis to enhance
the likelihood that concepts were translated successfully
from one study to another [26]. Descriptive themes
emerged which were used to describe groups of codes
within each category of work. Using the framework we
were able to draw comparisons between these themes
and move beyond the primary findings presented within
each individual paper. Individual benefits and disadvan-
tages of pet ownership were considered in terms of the
conditions and contexts they emerged from.
Results
The search resulted in 17 studies for synthesis; the
flow of studies is outlined in Fig. 1. All study cha-

 Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4. Of the 17 studies, 8 were
conducted in the USA [27–34], 4 in the UK [9, 35–37], 2
in Canada [38, 39] and 1 each in the Netherlands [40],
Australia [41], and Sweden [42]. Twelve of the studies
were reported in journal articles [9, 27, 30, 32–35, 38–42]
and 5 were part of doctoral research [28, 29, 31, 36, 37].
Eight of the studies used qualitative methodology [9, 27,
28, 31, 34, 36, 37, 42], 6 were quantitative [29, 30, 33, 38–40]
and 3 used mixed methods [32, 35, 41]. Methods used in
the qualitative work included grounded theory [32, 36]
thematic analysis [41, 42] phenomenology [28, 31] and
framework analysis [9]. Quantitative studies employed
cross-sectional survey design and used a variety of de-
scriptive statistics [29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 39–41] correlational
analysis [41] and regression analysis [29, 33, 35, 40].
All participants in the studies resided within the commu-
nity and had either a diagnosed serious mental health con-
dition [9, 30–32, 38, 39], mental health problems associated
with a physical health condition [29, 33–35, 40, 41], mental
health problems associated with a developmental disorder
[37, 42] or self-reported mental health conditions [27, 28].
Two of the studies involved interviews with parents of chil-
dren who had a family pet [37, 42], the remaining studies
collected data directly from participants with a companion
animal. Twelve of the studies included all types of compan-
ion animals [9, 27, 31–36, 39–42] and four specifically fo-
cused on either dogs and/or cats [28–30, 38]. A total of
1727 pet owners were involved in the included studies.
Of the 17 included studies, 15 reported positive aspects
of pet ownership for people experiencing mental health
problems [9, 27–30, 32–40, 42] and 9 reported negative
elements [9, 27, 32, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42]. Neutral effects
of pet ownership were reported in some of the included
quantitative studies, where no difference in mental health
outcomes, social contacts or loneliness were reported for
pet owners compared to non-pet owners [29, 32, 35, 40].
Benefits were mostly demonstrated through qualitative
data, and negative elements, which were highlighted, were
largely over-shadowed by co-occurring positive impact of
pets in these studies [9, 27, 32, 35, 36, 38, 42].
Themes
Emotional work - alleviating worry, providing comfort and
mitigating against feelings of isolation and loneliness
Evidence from quantitative studies relating to contribu-
tion of pets to emotional work was mixed. There were
significant findings for the benefits of canine compan-
ionship for military veterans with post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), including effects on reducing feelings
of loneliness, depression, worry and irritability, and in-
creased feelings of calmness [30] and there was some
evidence for the direct effect of pets on depression and
mood [30, 35] through close proximate contact and
stroking [35]. However, this finding was not wholly
supported by other quantitative studies, which re-
ported neutral or small negative effects of pet owner-
ship [29, 35, 40, 41]. A study investigating the effect of
pet ownership and strength of attachment on depression
found that pet owners were just as likely as non-pet
owners to be depressed [33]. However this focussed on
the sequela of depression not its alleviation or contribu-
tion of pets to managing post diagnosis. Interestingly, a
study by Siegel found that pets had an effect in mediating
the relationship between AIDS diagnosis and depression
and that there was a weak trend towards dogs being more
successful in this role than cats [33].
The importance of pets in relation to the provision
of emotional work was a recurrent theme in the nu-
merous qualitative studies included in the review
where people reported a profound connection with
their pet [9, 27, 30–32, 38, 39] sometimes preferring rela-
tionships with pets over relationships with other humans
[37] and viewing pets as replacement family members
[32]. The mechanisms through which pets made the per-
ceived contribution to emotional work seemed to be the
provision of a consistent source of comfort and affection
[9, 34, 36, 41, 42]. This constant presence meant that this
provision was available instantaneously without request
[9, 27, 36, 42]. Pets provided calming support and were
perceived to have a ‘sense’ of when it was needed.
“The dog approaches Karin when she’s crying and
comforts her by lying next to her and licking away her
tears. The dog hears her, and wherever he is in the
house, he comes to her. We can’t always comfort her.
Sometimes Karin has said,‘It’s a good thing we have
the dog, otherwise no one would be able to comfort
me” [42].
Pets were able to provide unique emotional support
as a result of their ability to respond to their owners in
an intuitive way, especially in times of crisis and pe-
riods of active symptoms [9, 30, 31, 35, 36]. A related
impact on loneliness was achieved through physical
contact which reduced feelings of isolation [28, 36],
providing a source of physical warmth and companion-
ship [35], and by providing opportunities for communi-
cation [34, 36].
“It is very important of people not to feel alone and
isolated, and pets help you feel like you’re like
everyone else. Not less than other people. My birds are
very important to me and I think other people with
other pets feel that way, too” [27].
The study by Ford found that people were able to con-
fide in their pets when they were unable to open up to
other people.

 “Sometimes if I talk to the cat, perhaps it's like being
in a confessional, I find I can address things that
perhaps I wouldn't have done normally if I hadn't
have had the cat to talk to” [36].
In this respect, pets provided a safe environment
where people can talk without fear of being judged or
being a burden to others [9]. This was echoed in work
where people reported that their dogs allowed them to
express their feelings and clarify their thoughts without
the concern that they will interrupt, offer criticism or
advice, or betray confidence [30, 31].
“They don’t have input, “this is what you should do, or
maybe you should try this” or all the other
commentary I get from people, who are trying to be
helpful in their own right…their dying devotion and
love, it’s true friendship” [31].
The sentiment of pets being non-judgemental under-
pins the absence of conditionality, which was a recurring
finding in included studies. Pets provided unconditional
love and affection [9, 30, 31, 34, 42] which fostered self-
acceptance and congruence [28]. Pets constituted a
source of support which people could trust and rely on
compared with other social network members [9]; they
provided simple relationships free from conflict [28] and
they did not overstep boundaries [31]. The latter seems
to be particularly beneficial for people with Autism [37]
and PTSD [30].
“The dog offers comfort in a different way to how I do,
more unconditional. Åsa can hold the dog when she is
feeling miserable. The dog doesn’t ask why or what’s
happened” [42].
By providing unconditional positive regard, pets pro-
moted emotional stability through the regulation of feel-
ings, management of stress and helping people to cope
with difficult life events [27, 42]. For people living alone,
pets provided a source of ‘connectedness’ [27], reassur-
ance, and normalcy [31].
She’s always there for me in a regular way of
managing my stress. I tell her about my days, she
snuggles, cuddles and sleeps with me [34].
Practical work - physical activity and symptom distraction
Quantitative data implicating pets in the practical work
associated with mental health management pointed to
the impact of dog ownership on physical activity [40]
and self-reported quality of life related to physical health
[29]. One study found that those with pets were more
significantly likely to use ambulatory mental health care
than those without [40].
Qualitative results from the studies expanded on ill-
ness specific practical work including in times of crisis
[9, 28, 30–32, 35–38, 41, 42]. The main mechanism
through which pets appeared to contribute to practical
work was through the ability of pets to distract and dis-
rupt attention from symptoms or upsetting experiences
such as hearing voices, panic attacks or suicidal ideation
[9, 27, 28, 30–32, 34, 36]. Pets contributed to practical
work directly and indirectly by acting as a form of bridg-
ing tie to additional resources.
But if I’m here and I’m having…having problems with
voices and that, erm, it does help me in the sense, you
know, I’m not thinking about the voices, I’m just
thinking of when I hear the birds singing [9].
One quantitative study by Stern and colleagues [30]
demonstrated that whilst participants with PTSD did not
report feeling less affected by painful memories or flash-
backs they indicated that their pet tried to cheer them up
when experiencing symptoms, indicating that the pres-
ence of their pet may have lessened a modicum of the
negative impact of trauma [30].
Qualitative data pointed to the way in which pets were
able to undertake the activities of practical work because of
their consistent and proximate presence and through pro-
viding the opportunity for reciprocity [9, 27, 31, 34, 36].
Pets’ contribution to practical work is seemingly made pos-
sible through the provision of opportunities for routine
tasks required to care for an animal, providing a positive
focus for activity [9, 27, 30–32, 34, 36, 42], providing a
needed challenge [36], by introducing humour into situa-
tions [9], providing a direct grounding role [30, 31, 38],
lessening the negative impact of symptoms [9, 30] and re-
ducing the stress associated with the vagaries of living with
their condition [34]. One study found that participants felt
that they required less medication because of this pet con-
tribution [31].
So the physical thing of having to brush her and take
her out and feed her, check that her toenails don't
need cutting, you know perhaps pick up after her if
she's had an accident, things like that. Cos she can be
quite demanding as you've seen, she's up and she
wants attention all the time, so it… interrupts your
thought process a lot of the time [36].
They are something that is very important in my
recovery and helping me not get too depressed. Even
when I was so depressed, I was kind of suicidal. I
never got really bad, but I was suicidal at one time.

 The thing that made me stop was wondering what the
rabbits would do. That was the first thing I thought
of and I thought, oh yeah, I can’t leave because the
rabbits need me. So they were playing a really big role
in that [32].
Pets could contribute to a sense of preparedness to
take self-management action through increasing people’s
positivity and self-efficacy [32, 34, 41, 42]. They encour-
aged their owners to stay in the present avoiding worry
and ruminations about past behaviours [28, 30] or con-
cerns about the future [34]. Pets were also considered
important in terms of providing protection for their
owners [28, 31]. This was particularly of value for those
participants experiencing the constant vigilance associ-
ated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [31].
He’ll start nudging me or hopping on me to get me into
a petting session or he’ll grab my pants leg and start
pulling on me or like my shirt or my arm and start
pulling on me to kind of like bring me out of a
flashback or anything else like that [31].
Owners felt that their pets could sense when practical
support for mental health was required and acted ac-
cordingly [9, 28, 31, 42]. However, this was not universal
to all studies indicating the impact of pets cannot be
fully explained by this behavioural initiation [37].
The puppy followed Bengt’s mood from the very first
day. The dog reads him inside and out, she knows
exactly when to go to him and when to keep back. If
Bengt is unsettled and moving around, he may stop
occasionally and sit down … and then along she
comes. Then she kneels down and starts to nudge and
lick him, and he starts to stroke her. She also knows
if he’s in conflict with us. Then she follows him … and
if he hasn’t closed his door, she goes in and sits with
him [42].
Pam named the contact itself as playing a significant
role in helping her to manage anxiety attacks. She
specifically described an example of when her
companion dog came to her during an anxiety attack in
the middle of the night: Brutus licked her face and laid
next to her for the rest of the night, and contact with
him immediately improved her acute symptoms [28].
Indirectly, pets encouraged a form of behavioural acti-
vation. Pets were seen to enhance mobility [41], increase
exercise [30, 35, 36, 40] and promote contact with
nature [30, 36] all of which were considered beneficial to
mental health.
Pets as conduits to social interaction and emotional
nourishment
A feature of the role attributed to pets in terms of mental
health management in the qualitative data was the various
ways in which they facilitated the quality and quantity of
social interactions. Pets reportedly increased social inter-
action with others including friends and family [34] and
with more peripheral social interactions [9, 38]. They also
fostered a sense of social and community integration
[9, 32, 35, 36, 38, 42]. Interestingly, one study found
that dogs increased social interactions that would not have
been possible without their pet (e.g. other dog walkers
[36]). This was supported by some [39] but not all of the
included quantitative studies [29, 32, 39, 40] indicating a
complicated relationship between pets and social inter-
action which may be mediated by type of pet and/or num-
ber of pets [22].
Get out of the scope of a physical disability. I mean a
physical disability yeah. I can’t get through that door. I
can’t get up those steps. For a mental health patient it is
not the physical barrier it’s an invisible [barrier] … Yes,
these guys help me interact. Butch, when we go out …
when Butch and I go out, we interact because he gets so
much attention and with the attention focused on him, I
can get engaged in all sorts of conversations with people
who like dogs, so with these guys we develop friends who
are into the same thing [38].
That surprised me, you know, the amount of people
that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me
up with him. I haven’t got much in my life, but he’s
quite good, yeah [9].
The reasons identified in the included studies as to
why pets were considered useful in terms of enhancing
the amount and quality of social interactions included
having the confidence to venture into new social situa-
tions with their pet, owners finding it easier to be in the
presence of other people when their pet was present
[30], being more open during social interactions [28]
and being able to have difficult conversations with exist-
ing friends and family through their pet [34, 36].
Biographical work - identity, a sense of self-worth and
existential meaning
The data implicating pets in biographical work was mostly
derived from the qualitative data. Two quantitative studies
addressed this type of work; one found that despite a low
effect score, pet owners performed significantly higher
than non-pet owners on meaningful activity scales [39]
and another found that since getting their pets individuals
felt better about themselves as people [30].

 Qualitative data suggested that pets provided their
owners with a sense of purpose and gave meaning to
their lives [41]. Often participants described how this
had been diminished since diagnosis with a mental
health condition but that pets helped them to overcome
this and provided them with a platform for going for-
ward with their lives [9, 38]. This sense of meaning and
purpose included pets giving their owners a reason to
live [9, 32], to contributing to a sense of control and em-
powerment [9, 31, 32, 35] and giving individuals hope
for the future [9, 31]. This was considered particularly
important when people were feeling consumed by illness
or when self-management felt out of control [32].
It gives me something to do, to take care of them, the
cleaning of the cage, feeding them [34].
Owners’ felt that their pets contributed directly to
maintaining a consistent sense of identity and self [9, 27,
32, 36, 39, 41]. They felt pets provided a form of valid-
ation through the pride associated with successfully car-
ing for a pet [9, 28] but also as sustaining elements of
pre-illness identities including roles of mother, pet
owner or animal lover [9, 36] and as being a protector of
animals [28, 31].
My best quality is that I love animals and I take care
of animals… Other than that, I can’t think of anything
real outstanding [32].
Pets were also considered relevant in terms of mediating
how other people viewed them [9, 42]. Pet ownership con-
nected their owners to valued activities such as hobbies
[35] and were considered a culturally sanctioned meaning-
ful occupational and social role [38, 39]. One study also
indicated that the mastery achieved through the training
of animals also contributed to a positive sense of self [9].
Participants described elements of relationships with
pets that were important to their mental health includ-
ing the nature of relationships as simple and reciprocal,
pets as understanding and honouring personal bound-
aries and pets not holding past behaviours against
them [9, 27, 32, 36, 39, 41]. These components were
often missing from other human relationship and were
considered important aspects of the human/pet dyad [9].
For Irene, taking care of her companion dog facilitated
a change in her sense of self, from seeing herself as
someone who “destroyed anything [she] loved” to
seeing herself as a loving, nurturing protector [28].
There’s a lot less things to worry about. I mean you
can’t…you can’t like be like if he was naughty or
anything like that you’d tell him off and that was it
and there’d be no hard feelings. That there’s not, you
don’t get the nastiness [9].
Pets impacted directly on the management of negative
perceptions and experiences related to a diagnosis of
mental illness which arose either from themselves or
from others within and outside of their existing social
networks [9, 28, 31, 34, 35, 39]. The mechanisms
through
which
this
appeared
to
operate
included
counterbalancing a loss of social status as a result of
being diagnosed with a mental illness, providing non-
judgemental acceptance often not available elsewhere
[9], making owners feel wanted and valued [34, 39] and
encouraging owners to feel good about themselves
[28, 30]. One study proposed that companion animals
symbolised abused childhood selves and that by car-
ing for a pet they may have symbolically been caring
for this part of themselves [28].
When he comes and sits up beside you on a night, it’s
different, you know, it’s just, like, he needs me as much
as I need him, sort of thing [9].
Negative aspects of pet ownership
Despite an overall sense of the positive impact of pet
ownership on the management of diagnosed mental
health disorders, some negative aspects surfaced within
individual quantitative and qualitative studies. This in-
cluded aspects such as financial costs and housing situ-
ations, the burden of pet ownership especially if pets
were unruly which could be detrimental to mental
health and the guilt that owners experienced if this was
not managed successfully [9, 35, 36, 38, 39]. Horses and
dogs were considered the most burdensome in this re-
gard and research highlighted the importance of match-
ing pets to individual circumstances [36]. The early
stages of pet ownership were often the most difficult
for people but were concomitantly considered as an
important investment in terms of future support and
companionship [35]. Pets could also be seen as a bar-
rier to aspirational goals associated with recovery such
as travel [9, 35].
When I was working it wasn't a problem, but
obviously when you're on a low budget income, it
does become a financial hazard, because they're
just unexpected you know. That's where the issues
become, do you keep them or do you…and you
don't want to let them go so you're sitting there,
having to cut back and scrape the bottom of the
barrel to make sure they're looked after sort
of thing [36].

 I was trying to care for 3 cats of my own that I loved,
stray cats in the neighbourhood I was feeding. I tried
to spay the ones that appeared to be pregnant, and I
was putting food out twice a day, and I was just
feeling overwhelmed, just overwhelmed and more and
more depressed, more a sense of failure, and finally it
just got worse and worse and worse [32].
The potential or actual loss of beloved companion
animals was a major source of distress for owners
[9, 32, 38, 42] but it was acknowledged that joy could
still be taken in their memories once death had been come
to terms with [32] and that such experiences could facili-
tate understanding of other difficult life events [42].
I was very depressed by [pet’s] death. While she was
getting worse, we had her home for a while and I had
to make myself be strong […] It was more after her
death that I kind of broke down, and just thinking
about her would make me cry for a couple of weeks or
more. Gradually I got to the point where I knew that it
was her time. The life that she had and what she had
given to me, I could always think of that. It always
makes me happy [32].
Participants described how other people including
health professionals were often concerned about the safety
of their pets and their ability to care for them [27, 33].
Siegel et al. demonstrated that those with HIV felt there
was a perception that they should not have pets as a result
of their condition [30]. This may also apply to those with
mental health conditions but this was not covered in any
of the included papers.
Discussion
This review represents the first attempt to systematically
identify and synthesise evidence related to the benefits
of pet ownership for those with diagnosed mental health
conditions. The majority of relevant data extracted for
purposes of this review were qualitative and high quality
prospective experimental studies were distinctly lacking.
This indicates that the evidence in relation to the role of
pets for the management of diagnosed mental health
conditions is at an early stage and currently disparate
and exploratory in nature. The use of thematic analysis
informed by an existing framework led to the identifica-
tion of a number of mechanisms through which com-
panion animals were seen to support their owners to
manage their mental health conditions. Very little data
fell outside of the framework and what did related
mostly to the demographics of pet owners. The results
support the wider health benefits of companion animals
for the general population [6–8]. However, the discrepancy
often identified between quantitative and qualitative find-
ings within the review and the range of factors mediating
the relationship between pets and their owners identified
within existing literature speaks to the complexity of this
relationship. Mediating factors included the type of pet
[33], the number of pets [30], perceived friendliness of pet
[41] and attachment to pet [33].
Pets were implicated in emotional work because they
provided a consistent and proximate source of calming
support and companionship [9, 27, 30–32, 38, 39]. This
was enhanced through a perception that animals could
intuit when such support was needed and act accordingly
providing a depth of connection that was considered par-
ticularly useful in time of crisis [9, 30, 31, 35, 36]. Com-
panion animals contributed to practical work through
their role in the distraction and disruption from upsetting
symptoms and experiences [9, 27, 28, 30–32, 34, 36]
through the provision of routine and a role in behavioural
activation [32, 34, 41, 42]. Pets were considered important
in the maintenance of a positive identity and sense of self
because of the reciprocity associated with human-pet
dyads [9, 27, 32, 36, 39, 41], a perception that pets ac-
cepted their owners without judgement, the sense of pride
associated with successfully caring for an animal [9, 28]
and supporting the management of felt and enacted
stigma [9, 28, 31, 34, 35, 39]. Qualitative data demon-
strated the relative strength of the role of pets in relation
to all three types of work but quantitative data was un-
available to unanimously support this impact particularly
in relation to practical and biographical work where quan-
titative evidence was distinctly lacking. Existing quantita-
tive studies failed to include measures which adequately
addressed the potential roles of companion animals as
identified within the qualitative data such as self-efficacy
and preparedness to take action.
Despite the mixed evidence from the quantitative data,
the participants included in the review enjoyed keeping
their animals and believed that they gained psychological
benefit from these relationships as demonstrated by the
thick descriptions derived from the qualitative data. The
review demonstrated that those with diagnosable mental
health problems can infer the same benefits from pet
ownership as the general population and pets may have
a particular role in terms of enhancing quality of life
given that levels of social exclusion and stigma are likely
to be greater for this population [9, 32, 35, 36, 38, 42].
Participants felt that their pets faciltiated the quality
and quantity of existing social interactions and forged
new relationships acting as a bridging tie to emotional
nourishment [9, 32, 34–36, 38, 42]. This is likely to be of
increasing importance given that social isolation is both
a cause and effect of mental illness and that those with
mental illness are considered one of the most socially
isolated social groups [43].
Brooks et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:31

 Despite these identified benefits, it appeared that rela-
tionships with companion animals are not considered or
incorporated into health care planning or wider health
related discussions of consultations [9]. The contrary ap-
pears to occur where individuals are advised against pet
ownership or experience negative attitudes from health
professional in relation to their pet [33, 34]. This indi-
cates pet ownership can create additional work for pro-
fessionals in terms of managing and advising people and
highlights the need for a focus on professional attitudes,
which is currently lacking from the evidence base.
The findings call for cultural changes in policy towards
the way in which pets can be incorporated with other
support in open systems which is often left untouched
or unconsidered by formal service provision. A different
logic of care is required; one which values the harnessing
of available and valued support identified by people,
which supports individuals’ capacity to undertake valued
activities (such as dog walking) and looks for support
which does not engage them in unequal power relation-
ships which can sometimes be anti-therapeutic. With
increasing emphasis being placed on evidence based
health care, such macro-level policy changes are likely to
necessitate strengthening the underpinning evidence
base given the low quality of evidence identified within
the review. Further exploration of the implementation
feasibility and optimal implementation models may also
be required, including the potentially important role of
inter-agency and third sector working.
Negative aspects of pet ownership identified in the re-
view included concerns about potential, and the signifi-
cant distress associated with the actual loss of a pet
supporting previous research [44]. Evidence from those
involved in natural disasters such as hurricanes suggest
that pet loss can add considerably to acute trauma and
increase the risk of long-term impacts [45, 46]. This
highlights the potential for the loss of an animal to be of
greater impact for those with diagnosable mental health
conditions given the intense and positive identification
reported with their pet and suggests the need to con-
sider pets in planning and delivery of mental health care.
Strengths and limitations
This review gains its strengths from the combination of
rigorous search and extraction methods and the under-
lying theoretical framework which guided the analysis.
To guard against bias in the undertaking of the review,
two reviewers independently extracted all data and
where disagreement occurred, these were discussed be-
tween authors until agreement was reached.
The level of quality across included studies was a lim-
iting factor in this review with an average quality rating
of 5.5 out of 10 for qualitative studies and 8.75 out of 10
for quantitative work (refer to Additional files 1 and 2).
There was also a lack of randomised trials evaluating the
impact of pet ownership on diagnosed mental health
problems. This is perhaps unsurprising given the prag-
matic difficulties associated with randomising individuals
or families to be pet or non-pet owners within RCTs.
Prospective
experimental
or
quasi-experimental
de-
signed studies should be used to compare outcomes for
pet owners and non-pet owners using measures that ad-
equately incorporate the range of tasks in relation to
each type of work as identified within this review. Given
the potential benefits which might be conveyed by pets
for people with mental health conditions, there is a clear
need for further rigorous, high quality research, in order
to consolidate these existing findings and build an evi-
dence base on which commissioners and policy makers
can base decisions.
As part of our inclusion criteria, we included only
those with a diagnosable mental health problem or men-
tal health components of a diagnosable physical health
condition which may have impacted on the studies in-
cluded in our review.
Conclusion
Despite some inadequacies in the data, this review sug-
gests that pets provide benefits to those with mental
health conditions through the intensity of connectivity
with their owners and the contribution they make to
emotional support in times of crises together with their
ability to help manage symptoms when they arise. Fur-
ther rigorous research is required to test this relation-
ship, incorporating outcomes that cover the range of
roles pets may have in relation to mental health identi-
fied within this review. The research studies included in
this review provide a point of debate that services and
policy makers may wish to consider in the future.
