Spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twinning occurs in 1%–4% of women, with familial clustering and unknown physiological pathways and
genetic origin. DZ twinning might index increased fertility and has distinct health implications for mother and child. We performed a
GWAS in 1,980 mothers of spontaneous DZ twins and 12,953 control subjects. Findings were replicated in a large Icelandic cohort and
tested for association across a broad range of fertility traits in women. Two SNPs were identified (rs11031006 near FSHB, p ¼ 1.54 3 10�9,
and rs17293443 in SMAD3, p ¼ 1.57 3 10�8) and replicated (p ¼ 3 3 10�3 and p ¼ 1.44 3 10�4, respectively). Based on ~90,000 births in
Iceland, the risk of a mother delivering twins increased by 18% for each copy of allele rs11031006-G and 9% for rs17293443-C. A higher
polygenic risk score (PRS) for DZ twinning, calculated based on the results of the DZ twinning GWAS, was significantly associated with
DZ twinning in Iceland (p ¼ 0.001). A higher PRS was also associated with having children (p ¼ 0.01), greater lifetime parity (p ¼ 0.03),
and earlier age at first child (p ¼ 0.02). Allele rs11031006-G was associated with higher serum FSH levels, earlier age at menarche, earlier
age at first child, higher lifetime parity, lower PCOS risk, and earlier age at menopause. Conversely, rs17293443-C was associated with
later age at last child. We identified robust genetic risk variants for DZ twinning: one near FSHB and a second within SMAD3, the product
of which plays an important role in gonadal responsiveness to FSH. These loci contribute to crucial aspects of reproductive capacity and
health.
Introduction
DZ twinning (MIM: 276400) is defined as the concomitant
conception and development of two independent zygotes
during one pregnancy. Mothers of spontaneous (conceived
without assisted reproductive technology) DZ twins have a
predisposition to multiple ovulation events due to interfer-
ence with single dominant follicle selection, a biological
mechanism fundamental for the human species.1 DZ twin-
ning is common, with large regional differences from 6 per
1,000 births in Asia to 40 per 1,000 births in Africa,2
whereas monozygotic twinning occurs around the world
at a constant rate of around 3 to 4 per 1,000 births.3,4
DZ twinning rates also vary substantially over time. For
example, in the US, the observed incidence of twin births
increased by a factor of 1.9 between 1971 and 2009.5
Although a considerable part of the increase is attribut-
able to fertility treatments, with an estimate of 36% of all
twins born in the USA in 2011 resulting from assisted
reproduction, the majority of twins are still conceived

 spontaneously. In addition to fertility treatments, in-
creases in maternal age contribute to increases in twinning
incidence.3,6
Twinning is associated with increased risks to mother
and offspring, including higher risks of stillbirth, neonatal
death, and premature birth. Compared to singleton chil-
dren, twins use more hospital resources, especially during
the first year of life,7 with hospital costs in the first 5 years
of life being as much as 3.3-fold higher.8
Mothers of DZ twins differ from other women in that
they are taller, have an increased BMI, are more often over-
weight, and more often smoke before the twin pregnancy.9
Family history, increased parity, and gravidity all increase
the risk of spontaneous DZ twinning.1,3 Remarkably, twin-
ning rates do not reflect average nutritional status of a
population, as established from longitudinal studies in
countries that experienced periods of starvation, such as
the Dutch hunger winter. Above a specific, yet undeter-
mined, threshold, nutrition seems to be of minimal impor-
tance for reproduction in general and also for twinning.10
These observations all point to spontaneous twinning be-
ing a heritable trait and suggest the potential for polygenic
inheritance. In a landmark study of twinning based on
data from genealogic records from Utah,11 White and Wy-
shak established that the genotype of the mother, but not
that of the father, affects the frequency of DZ twinning.
The underlying physiological mechanism for DZ twin-
ning is the release and fertilization of two or more oocytes.
Ovarian folliculogenesis and determination of ovulation
quota are controlled both by circulating concentrations
of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and by intra-ovarian
factors including the two oocyte growth factors, GDF9
and BMP15, as well as their cognate receptors.12 In the
common marmoset monkey (subfamily Callitrichinae),
DZ twins comprise the predominant litter size, and single-
tons are rarely, if ever, observed. On DNA sequencing,
specific nonsynonymous substitutions were identified in
GDF9, BMP15, BMP4, and WFIKKN1 as having a role in
Callitrichine twinning.13 These genes are among a larger
set of 63 candidate genes with a potential involve-
ment in regulation of ovulation number and/or control
of growth and body size.14
Efforts to characterize the genes that contribute to
DZ twinning in humans have not been successful. Candi-
date gene and genome-wide linkage studies failed to un-
cover common variants associated with DZ twinning,15–19
although one study reported rare variants in GDF9 (MIM:
601918) to be associated with DZ twinning.18 In laboratory
mice, DZ twinning, which is measured as litter size, is
strongly dependent on genetic background. It can range
from 2 to 3 DZ twins per litter in some 129 sub-strains to
12 or more DZ twins per litter in the FVB/NJ strain (see Jack-
son Lab Breeding Strategy manual in Web Resources). Phylo-
genetically, litter size is also correlated with the number of
functional mammary glands—two in dolphins, a monoto-
cous species, and eight in cats, a polytocous species—sug-
gesting the existence of common genetic determinants.
DZ twinning has been suggested as a measure of human
fertility both at the individual and at the population
level.20 Spontaneous DZ twinning might be considered
as a marker of high fertility, because it reflects the fre-
quency of double ovulation, the probability of coitus
within the appropriate time frame with fertilization of
both ova, and maintenance of a multiple pregnancy.
The aim of this study was to perform a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) in mothers of spontaneous DZ
twins to identify relevant genomic regions and test their
significance across a broad range of female fertility and
reproductive traits including age at menarche, age at natu-
ral menopause, age at first and last child, and lifetime par-
ity. Three twin registers, from the Netherlands, Australia,
and Minnesota (USA) had detailed information on sponta-
neous twinning in mothers of DZ twins, as well as geno-
type data. Replication of top hits for twinning was possible
in the Icelandic population and for other measures of
reproductive aging in several large-scale population meta-
analyses.21–24
Material and Methods
Descriptions of Participating Studies
Netherlands Twin Register
The Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) sample consisted of 806 case
subjects and 4,535 control subjects from the Netherlands Twin
Register (2,776 participants) and the Netherlands Study of Depres-
sion and Anxiety (NESDA; 2,565 participants). NTR participants
were ascertained by the presence of liveborn twins or triplets in
the family and consist of multiples, their parents, siblings, and
spouses. Twins were born in all strata of society and NTR repre-
sents a general sample from the Dutch population.25–28 NESDA
is a longitudinal study focusing on the course and consequences
of depression and anxiety disorders. Subjects for NESDA were re-
cruited from the general population, mental health organizations,
and general practices. The sample includes subjects selected for
depression and anxiety as well as healthy control subjects.29
Zygosity of twins was confirmed by DNA genotyping. Data on
mode of pregnancy were available from several data collection
waves including surveys sent out to mothers of twins, a survey
to parents upon registration of young twins, and telephone inter-
views as part of a project on DZ twinning.9 The comparison of the
survey data with the hospital records showed that mothers can
accurately report on the mode of conception of their twins.30 Par-
ticipants were excluded if they reported the use of assisted repro-
ductive technology at one or more occasions. In case no reports
on mode of pregnancy were available, data were excluded unless
the twins were born prior to 1985.
QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute
The sample used in this analysis consisted of 606 case subjects and
6,656 control subjects. The individuals were drawn from families
containing (any type of) twins recruited for prior studies, either
from around Australia from the Australian Twin Registry (ATR)
(generally twins born before 1971) or from south-eastern Queens-
land (generally twins born after 1980). Study recruitment was pre-
dominantly population based (any family where the twins were
willing to participate) with no screening performed on reproduc-
tive phenotypes apart from selecting families with twins. Studies

 for the older cohort typically were focused on personality traits but
not selected for them. Zygosity of twins was reported at time of
recruitment and during phenotyping studies and tested by geno-
typing (on SNP arrays or Sequenom assays). New phenotyping
excluded mothers (case subjects) from Queensland cohort who
used assisted reproductive technology (ART, typically IVF or hor-
mone treatment) to become pregnant. Screening questions asked
of the mother during clinical sessions for phenotyping were the
primary basis for excluding ART cases. A smaller subset of mothers
was contacted specifically to establish this information where it
was not otherwise available. For the older (ATR) cohort, at the
time of the twins’ birth, IVF was not yet in clinical use and other
ART was rare.
Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research
All subjects in this sample were independently ascertained
through vital records of the State of Minnesota in an effort to
construct a population-based twin registry.31,32 The sample for
the current study consisted of 568 mothers of DZ twins and
1,862 control subjects who were the parents of MZ twins from
1,062 families, including 800 complete parental pairs, 203
mothers, and 59 fathers. Most of the twins were born in the
1970s or early 1980s, when even though fertility treatment was
available in the US, it was expensive and few had access to it. Gen-
otyping was population based and independent of phenotypes
other than twinning. About 92% of the registry, and 100% of
both case and control samples, are of primarily European ancestry.
Iceland
Mothers of twins or other multiples (‘‘twins’’) were selected from
among those taking part in deCODE’s genetic studies based on
a nation-wide genealogical database. To increase the proportion
of these mothers of twins who were mothers of dizygotic twins,
twins who had been genotyped and shown to be monozygotic
were not used to identify mothers. Control subjects were indi-
viduals participating in deCODE’s genetic research from which
both mothers of twins and the mothers’ first-degree relatives had
been removed. For the prediction of twinning using polygenic
risk scores, mothers having opposite sex or verified dizygotic twins
were compared with mothers who did not have twins.
Study Design, Genome-Wide Association Study, and
Replication
We established the Twinning GWAS Consortium (TGC) to charac-
terize the genetic basis of DZ twinning in humans and performed a
genome-wide association study (GWAS) for DZ twinning utilizing
data from 1,980 mothers of DZ twins (MODZT) and 12,953 control
subjects from European ancestry cohorts. Sample sizes and study
characteristics are described in Table 1. All case subjects underwent
screening to exclude mothers who received assisted reproductive
techniques. Control subjects were screened to exclude pedigrees
containing DZ twins. In the replication stage, significant findings
from the meta-analysis were tested in large Icelandic cohort of
3,597 mothers of twins and 297,348 control subjects. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent, including consent
for genotyping and analysis, and were recruited according to
the protocols approved by the institution review board of each
institution.
Fertility Traits Measures
Fertility measures (having children, number of children, age at
first and last child, and average birth interval) were defined in
females born before 1970 based on the Icelandic genealogy. Data
for age at menarche, age at menopause, and polycystic ovary
syndrome were derived from previously published GWAS consor-
tia.21–24 Sample sizes and study characteristics are described in
Table 2.
Genotyping, Quality Control, and Imputation
Each participating cohort performed participant-level genotyping
of SNPs that included standard quality-control measures for geno-
typing and imputation (Table S1).
Netherlands Twin Register
DNA extraction and purification of blood or buccal samples
has been performed at various stages in time, according to manu-
facturer-specific protocols. Genotyping was done on multiple
platforms, for several partly overlapping subsets (N ¼ 1,771).
Chronologically the following platforms have been used Affy-
metrix Perlegen 5.0 (2,481 individuals), Illumina 660 (739 in-
dividuals), Illumina Omni Express 1M (148 individuals), and
Affymetrix 6.0 (3,744 individuals). After array-specific data anal-
ysis, genotype calls were made with the platform-specific software
(APT Genotyper, Beadstudio, Birdseed). Quality control has been
done within, as well as between, platforms and subsets. SNPs
from each platform were removed if they had mismatching alleles

 with the reference set, if the allele frequencies differed more than
0.20 with the reference set, if the MAF was < 1%, if the HWE
p value was < 0.00001, or if the call rate was < 95%. Samples
were excluded from the data if their expected sex did not match
their genotyped sex, if the genotype missing rate was above
10%, or if the PLINK F inbreeding value was either > 0.10
or < �0.10. After these steps, the data of the individual chips
were merged into a single dataset using PLINK 1.07.33 Within
the merged set, identity by state (IBS) sharing was calculated be-
tween all possible individual pairs and compared to the expected
family structure of the NTR study. Samples were removed if the
data did not match the expected IBS sharing. DNA samples that
were typed on multiple platforms were filtered if the overlapping
SNPs had a concordance rate below 99.0%. On the merged data,
the HWE and MAF SNP filters were re-applied, as well as the refer-
ence allele frequency difference < 0.20 checks. As a final prior step
to imputation, SNPs with C/G and A/T allele combinations were
removed if the MAF was between 0.35 and 0.50 to avoid wrong
strand alignment for these SNPs. Phasing of all samples and
imputing cross-missing platform SNPs was done with MACH
(1.0.16). The phased data were then imputed with Minimac
(17072013) to the 1000 Genomes phase1 release v3 20101123
SNPs INDELS SVS ALL panel as a reference set. SNPs were removed
if the Mendelian error rate was above 2%. Principal components
(PCs) of genetic ancestry were inferred via EIGENSOFT.34 The first
three PCs were retained and used as covariates to correct for the
Dutch population substructure35 and sample specific covariates.
Non-European ancestry samples were removed.
QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute
Genotyping was an expansion and re-imputation of the dataset
used in Medland et al.36 being a subset of the imputed version
of an existing dataset of ~19,000 individuals (also used for
example in Luong et al.,19 Medland et al.,37 and Wood et al.38).
The ~19,000 were genotyped at different times in batches of 200
to 4,436 individuals on different Illumina genotyping chips vari-
ously at deCODE, CIDR, and the Diamantina Institute with geno-
typing mainly on 317K or 370K chips for the older cohort and
610K chips for the younger cohort and a minority of the older
cohort. For individuals used here: the chips were 317K (342
individuals), 370K-duo (2,434 individuals), 370K-quad (1,453
individuals), 610K-quad (2,829 individuals), and 660K-quad
(104 individuals). Data were QCd batch-wise (drop any SNPs
with MAF < 1%; p(HWE) < 10�6; mean(GC) < 0.7; or call rate <
95%), integrated as a single family-based dataset, and checked
for Mendelian errors. The ~280K SNPs passing QC in all batches
were used as input to the imputation process that involved stand-
alone phasing without reference panel of the ~280K SNPs using
MACH v.1.0.16 or v.1.0.18 (depending on chromosome) followed
by imputation by minimac (v.17072013) and the ‘‘all popula-
tion’’ 1000 Genomes Phase 1 Release v.3 20101123 (filtered to
exclude monomorphic SNPs). Individuals of obvious non-Euro-
pean ancestry were excluded (those more than 6 SD from the
European centroid of PC1/PC2 from a principal-components anal-
ysis in EIGENSOFT34 with axes constructed using HapMap and
GenomeEUTWIN samples).
Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research
The American samples were drawn from the longitudinal Minne-
sota Twin Family Study.32 Participants were genotyped by Julie
Cunningham’s group at Mayo Clinic on Illumina’s Human660W-
Quad Array (Illumina) with Illumina GenomeStudio (v.1.5.16)
software for genotype calling according to standard protocol. Of
the 561,490 non-intensity SNP markers on the array, 527,829
(94.0%) were retained after eliminating markers that had (1) call
rates < 99%, (2) minor allele frequency < 1%, (3) significant devia-
tion from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at p < 10�7, (4) more than
two mendelian inconsistencies across families or more than one
mismatch in duplicated samples, (5) an association with partici-
pant sex or batch at p < 10�7, or (6) been identified by Illumina
as a bad marker on the array. Samples were eliminated if they had
(1) more than 5,000 non-calls, (2) low Gen_Call scores, (3) extreme
homozygosity or heterozygosity, or (4) failed to have familial rela-
tionships or sex confirmed, suggesting a sample mixup. European
ancestry was confirmed by principal-component analysis using
EIGENSTRAT as described by Miller et al.31 and the phased Euro-
pean samples from 1000 Genomes, March 2012, were used as refer-
ence data. Prephasing and imputation were done by Jae Hoon
Sul at UCLA using Beagle (v.3.3.2) for prephasing and minimac
(v17072013) for imputation. This provided us with 10,011,985
imputed autosomal markers, including 9,170,060 markers with
Rsq > 0.30.
Iceland
Genotyping was performed with Illumina chips. Long-range
phasing and imputation of variants from 2,636 sequenced Ice-
landers was carried out with in-house software using the IMPUTE
model. Information about the genotypes of untyped individuals
that could be inferred from the genotypes of close relatives was
included as previously described.39
Association Tests
Each genome-wide association analysis from the three cohorts was
conducted using logistic regression under an additive genetic
model with adjustment for principal components of genetic
ancestry. Because the GWAS data include family members, we
added the –family option in the analysis, which takes the familial
structure of the data into account using a sandwich estimator.40
Imputed SNPs were analyzed by PLINK software33 and genotype
imputation uncertainty was accounted for by using allelic dosage
in PLINK.
Meta-analysis was performed using the fixed-effects inverse vari-
ance method based on the regression b estimates and standard
errors from each study implemented in METAL.41 The presence
of heterogeneity between cohorts for the effect sizes of risk alleles
was investigated using the Cochran’s Q-test as implemented in
METAL. To determine whether the genome-wide significant signal
at each locus with low LD in the same chromosomal region
(defined as r2 < 0.05 in a 750-kb region) could be accounted for
by a single SNP, we carried out conditional analysis. Each cohort
performed a genome-wide analysis for MODZT using logistic
regression adjusting for the top signal at each of the three associ-
ated regions to determine whether potential second signals re-
mained significant even after adjusting for these variants. Results
from each individual study were meta-analyzed to determine
whether these potential second signals were truly independent
(that is, if p < 5 3 10�8). In Iceland, being a mother of twins
was tested for association with the top alleles using logistic regres-
sion and including age, age2, and county of birth as covariates as
described previously.42 Associations between FSH level and geno-
type were assessed by linear regression as described previously.42
To study the association of fertility measures and SNP genotype,
we used logistic regression (having children), Poisson log-linear
regression (number of children), or linear regression (age at first
child, age at last child, and average birth interval). In these
analyses, birth cohort (as a factor for each 5-year interval), county
The American Journal of Human Genetics 98, 898–908, May 5, 2016
901
 of birth, and six principal components were included as covari-
ates. Relatedness was controlled for by using genomic control in
all Icelandic association analyses.43 The combined p value of the
meta-analysis and the replication study was calculated by Fisher’s
combined probability test.44
FSH Serum Level Measure
Serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured
in 2,411 men (1,275 genotyped persons; 1,136 close relatives
of genotyped individuals) and 15,586 women (9,738 genotyped
persons; 5,848 close relatives of genotyped individuals) referred
to three clinics in Iceland. FSH testing was undertaken primar-
ily to investigate possible gonad impairment. Hormone levels
were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, using
reagents and analytical instruments from Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In Silico Functional Annotation
We used a number of publicly available bioinformatics tools and
datasets to identify putative functional effects of the top associ-
ated SNPs at each locus, including combined annotation depen-
dent depletion (CADD),45 HaploReg v.4.1,46 and variant effect
predictor (VEP).47
Gene-Based Test
Results of the MODZT meta-analysis were used to perform a gene-
based test of association for the 63 candidate genes from Harris
et al. using the knowledge-based mining system for genome-
wide genetic studies (KGG) software v.3.5.48,49 This approach
uses an extended Simes test that integrates prior functional infor-
mation and the meta-analysis association results when combining
the SNP p values within a gene in order to obtain an overall asso-
ciation p value for each entire gene. As we tested for genetic asso-
ciation for 63 genes, the significance level was set at 7.93 3 10�4
(Bonferroni correction; 0.05/63).
Polygenic Risk Scores
Polygenic risk scores were calculated based on the results of the
MODZT meta-analysis. Only markers having info > 0.9 in all
groups and MAF > 0.01 were included. To obtain effect sizes taking
LD into account, the LDpred method developed by Vilhja
´lmsson
and colleagues was used.50 As suggested by Vilhja
´lmsson et al.,
we calculated multiple sets of LD-modified effect sizes based on
a grid of values for the fraction of causal markers (a ¼ 0.0001,
0.0003, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1). The resulting scores
were then tested in a validation dataset of Icelandic mothers of
dizygotic twins. The score producing the most significant result

ation with five fertility-related traits (‘‘has children,’’ ‘‘number of

Results
Genome-wide Association Results, Replication, and
Gene-Based Analyses
We carried out a GWAS for DZ twinning in a discovery sam-
ple of 1,980 MODZT and 12,953 control subjects of Euro-
pean ancestry. Top SNPs were followed up in a replication
sample consisting of 3,597 mothers of twins and 297,348
control subjects. In addition, we tested the association of
the top SNPs with several measures of fertility (Table 2).
The overall GWAS meta-analysis genomic control statistic
(l) was 1.01, indicating no appreciable inflation due to
population structure. The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of
genome-wide p values showed a strong deviation from
the null hypothesis of no association (Figure S1). The
results are represented in the Manhattan plot (Figure 1).
Three chromosomal regions contained genome-wide sig-
nificant SNPs (p < 5 3 10�8). A total of 22 SNPs on chromo-
some 11p13 showed genome-wide significant associations.
Of these, the strongest signal (rs11031006, p ¼ 1.54 3 10�9
and OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29–1.53) lies in the region 50 of the
transcription start site of FSHB (encoding the FSH, beta
polypeptide [MIM: 136530]). A second locus was repre-
sented by five SNPs on 1q42.13 covering an intergenic re-
gion flanked by PGBD5 (MIM: 616791) and COG2 (MIM:
606974) (p ¼ 1.23 3 10�8, OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.31–1.55

1.57 3 10�8 and OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19–1.35) (Table 3
and Figure S2). No significant heterogeneity in SNP effects
was observed across cohorts for the top SNPs (p > 0.1,
Cochran’s Q test, Table S2). The regional association plots
for these loci are shown in Figure S2. After conditioning
on the top SNPs at each locus, no secondary signals
were observed (all p > 0.05; Tables S3–S5). We sought
validation of these three top signals in an independent
replication study from Iceland (deCODE) totaling 3,597
mothers of twins and 297,348 control subjects. The FSHB

was not confirmed (Table 3 and Figure 2). We also investi-
gated whether any of the proposed 63 candidate genes14
was associated with human DZ twinning. In a gene-based
test, five genes demonstrated a nominally significant as-
sociation (p < 0.05; BMPR1A [MIM: 601299], BMPR1B
[MIM: 603248], IGF1 [MIM: 147440], FSHB, and FSHR
[MIM: 136435]). After correction for multiple testing,
only FSHB remained significant (Table S6).
Functional In Silico Annotation of Associated Variants
We explored plausible functional effects of our associated
variants via combined annotation dependent depletion
(CADD).45 The FSHB SNP rs11031006 had a high Phred
scaled C-score (22.4), indicating that it is among the top
1% of SNPs in the human genome most likely to have a
functional effect. The Phred score for the SMAD3 SNP
rs17293443 was only 2.71, indicating that it is among the
bottom 50% of SNPs in the human genome likely to have
a functional effect (Table S7). Examination of individual
constituents of the CADD scores showed particularly high
conservation-based scores for rs11031006 (Figure S3). To
further investigate possible functional effects, we examined
data from the ENCODEproject.51TheFSHBSNPrs11031006
alters the sequence of 11 protein-binding motifs including
that of the estrogen receptor alpha, indicating a possible
effect on hormonal feedback inhibition (Table S8). Variant
effect predictor (VEP)47 identified rs17293443 as a regu-
latory region variant within a promoter flanking region
(ENSR00000410126) (Figure S4). SNP rs17293443 was con-
tained in a DNase I hypersensitive site suggesting open
chromatin, although it did not alter any of the transcrip-
tion factor binding sites present in the promoter flanking
region. Together, these data indicate that rs11031006 and
rs17293443 might have direct functional roles.
SNPs Associated with FSH Serum Level
We analyzed serum FSH measurements from 17,997 geno-
typed Icelanders and their close relatives. SNP rs11031006
was significantly associated with higher serum FSH levels
(p ¼ 2.3 3 10�10), with each G allele conferring an increase
in FSH level of about 0.11 SD units (Figure S5). Notably, the
allele (rs11031006-G) conferring the strongest association
with FSH levels in the FSH GWAS is the same allele that
conferred the greatest chance of having DZ twins in our
MODZT GWAS. No association was seen between the
SMAD3 signal and serum FSH levels (p ¼ 0.30).
Relative Risk of Twin Birth and Polygenic Risk Score
Prediction of DZ Twinning and Fertility Measures
We estimated that the risk of a twin birth, based on approx-
imately 90,000 births in Iceland between 1950 and 1991,
was increased by 18% for each maternal rs11031006-G
allele and by 9% for each rs17293443-C allele. A higher
polygenic risk score (PRS) for DZ twinning, calculated based
on the results of the DZ twinning GWAS, was significantly
associated with DZ twinning in our independent Icelandic
cohort (p ¼ 0.001) (Table S9). A higher PRS was also associ-
ated with a higher likelihood of having children (p ¼ 0.01),
higher lifetime number of children (p ¼ 0.03), and an earlier
age at first child (p ¼ 0.02) (Table S10). A re-calculated PRS,
excluding the 1 Mb regions surrounding the two replicated
variants, remained associated with DZ twinning (p ¼ 0.02)
and with the likelihood of having children (p ¼ 0.03). These
results reflect the polygenic contribution to the susceptibil-
ity to DZ twinning and its association with greater repro-
ductive ability.
SNPs Associated with Female Reproduction Traits
Table 4 reports on the two loci robustly implicated in
DZ twinning and other reproductive traits in women.
Consistent with its effects on higher circulating FSH levels,
the rs11031006-G allele is also associated with earlier age
at menarche,22,52 earlier age at first child, higher total
lifetime number of children, lower risk of polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS),23 and earlier age at natural meno-
pause.24,53 Also, the DZ twinning SNP rs11031006 is corre-
lated with a variant (rs10835638, FSHB c.211G>T) located
in the promoter of FSHB (r2 ¼ 0.62) that is associated with
timing of breast development in girls.54 In contrast, the
rs17293443-C allele in SMAD3 was associated only with a
later age at last child (Figure S6).

 Discussion
Here we report compelling evidence that sequence varia-
tion at the FSHB and SMAD3 loci increases the odds of
DZ twinning in women. A number of studies in mothers
of DZ twins, but not all,55 have found higher FSH levels
responsible for multiple follicle growth.56 The associations
of FSHB rs11031006-G with earlier ages at breast develop-
ment, menarche, menopause, and first child and higher
lifetime parity indicates that this locus plays an important
role in multiple reproductive aspects. Female carriers of
rs11031006-G probably have a more advanced depletion
of the ovarian follicular pool and hence would have an
increased risk of premature ovarian failure (POF [MIM:
612964]). Indeed, advanced ovarian aging is a recognized
feature of familial DZ twinning, with reported lower levels
of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), a marker of lower
ovarian primordial follicular reserve.57 The rs17293443-C
allele in SMAD3 also increases chances of DZ twinning,
but this effect appears independent of circulating FSH
levels.
Of the 63 suggested candidate genes for twinning, only
FSHB was associated in gene-based tests after correcting
for multiple testing. Emerging data in human and non-hu-
man primates suggest that mechanisms underlying multi-
ple ovulation might differ among species, explaining why
in some species twinning is accompanied by unique evolu-
tionary adaptations enabling offspring’s survival, such as
the marmoset diminutive fetal size in a simplex uterus
and subsequent alloparenting.14 Conversely, in humans,
multiple gestations remain an independent risk factor for
preterm birth, pregnancy loss, and fetal growth restriction.
Thus loci common to species and strains with higher rates
of DZ twinning will not necessarily be shared, as the rate,
complications, and future reproductive fitness of those
twin gestations differ.
The third genome-wide hit from the discovery was not
replicated in Iceland. SNP rs120644669 is located 149 kb
from the angiotensinogen (AGT [MIM: 106150]), which
influences ovulatory capacity in mice,58 and 89 kb from
component of oligomeric golgi complex 2 (COG2) affecting
protein glycosilation, which regulates the biological activity
of the pituitary gonadotrophins.59
Genetic variants near FSHB (rs11031005 and rs11031002,
which are highly correlated with rs11031006) are report-
edly associated not only with higher serum FSH, but also
with lower LH levels.60 This agrees with the known
response of the gonadotrophic cell to a high-frequency hy-
pothalamic pulsatile GnRH signal that reciprocally controls
secretion of both hormones.61 Furthermore, under normal
conditions, suppression of FSH in the early follicular phase
and higher LH levels in late phase typically favor mono-
ovulation in the human.62 In a study aiming to identify ge-
netic predictors for IVF success or IVF-controlled ovarian
stimulation (COS), rs611246 located in FSHB (r2 ¼ 0.3
with rs11031006) was reported significantly associated
with measured early follicular phase FSH values and
also with the probability of clinical pregnancy, suggesting
that these genetic variants are potential predictor candi-
dates that could be considered in clinical ovarian reserve
and function assessment in assisted reproduction.63
A recent linkage study in cattle reported only one strong
signal (p < 1 3 10�28) for ovulation rate in a region

 spanning SMAD3, SMAD6, and IQCH.64 SMAD3 encodes
one of a family of proteins that function as signal trans-
ducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multi-
ple signaling pathways. Observations in mice have estab-
lished an essential role for SMAD3 in mediating TGF-b
and activin signals in the ovarian granulosa cell and also
in the pituitary65 to maintain a favorable environment
for oocyte maturation.66 SMAD3 is strongly expressed
in the human ovary, where it promotes granulosa cell
proliferation and steroidogenesis possibly by upregulat-
ing gonadotrophin receptor signaling pathways.67 Thus,
sequence variation in SMAD3 might increase the chance
of DZ twinning by increasing responsiveness to FSH.
Understanding the role of SMAD3 will offer novel opportu-
nities to optimize responsiveness and minimize risk
among assisted reproduction technology (ART) recipients,
for example through adjustment of hormonal stimulation,
and thus contribute to prevention of life-threatening
ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome in hyper-responding
female carriers of the rs17293443-C allele and conversely
prevention of a poor response in individuals with allelic
variants that lead to a poor response.
The potential applications of this work in reproductive
medicine are multifold. First, it reveals a well-defined set
of loci for DZ twinning in the general population. Second,
twinning is associated with common perinatal morbidities
such as preterm birth, discordant twin growth, latter
prenatal asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction, and
placental abruption. Multiple gestations are also related
to a higher prevalence of maternal morbidities such as
preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, and ensuing com-
plications. By understanding the genetic basis of DZ
twinning, we concomitantly identify loci conferring sus-
ceptibility (or conversely resistance) to these prevalent
perinatal comorbidities. The involvement of SMAD3 is
of relevance in the light of a possible phenotype in male
DZ twins, namely the repeatedly reported more frequent
occurrence of testicular seminoma, a gonadal tumor in
which the mitogenic cyclin D2 is overexpressed.68,69 In
animal experimental studies, knockout of SMAD3 signifi-
cantly attenuates cyclin D2 and tumor proliferation.70
This indicates the likely clinical potential of SMAD3
stretching

and
treatment.
This study provides important insights into ovarian
functioning and the control of natural multiple follicle
growth and reproductive aging. This has important impli-
cations for fertility, including improved outcome predic-
tion and novel avenues of fertility treatment. Other
strengths include the rigorous phenotype inclusion of
mothers of DZ twins with a documented history of sponta-
neous DZ twinning. It is worth mentioning that analyses
done without excluding mothers who conceived DZ twins
after hormone induction of multiple ovulation or other
ART did not yield any genome-wide significant results
(results not shown). We thus recommend twin registries
to record these important data. We are aware of inherent
limitations to our current study because our efforts focused
only on unraveling the genetic basis of DZ twinning in
European-ancestry populations. The highest incidence
of DZ twins is reported in the Nigerian population and
some other African countries, and future analysis will
need to investigate the genetic underpinnings of DZ twin-
ning from these regions. In contrast, DZ twinning is a rare
trait in countries such as Japan and future studies should
address what the reasons might be.2

significantly and specifically associated with several other
aspects of reproductive capacity and health.
