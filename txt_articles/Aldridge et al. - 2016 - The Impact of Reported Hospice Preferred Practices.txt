 Abstract
Background—The Affordable Care Act requires hospices to report quality measures across a 
range of processes and practices. Yet uncertainties exist regarding the impact of hospice preferred 
practices on patient outcomes.
Objective—Assess the impact of six hospice preferred practices and hospice organizational 
characteristics on hospital utilization and death using the first national data on hospice preferred 
practices.
Design—Longitudinal cohort study (2008–2011) of Medicare beneficiaries (N=149,814) newly 
enrolled in a national random sample of hospices (N=577) from the National Hospice Survey 
(84% response rate) and followed until death.
Outcome Measures—The proportion of patients at each hospice admitted to the hospital, 
emergency department (ED), and intensive care unit (ICU), and who died in the hospital after 
hospice enrollment.
Results—Hospices that reported assessing patient preferences for site of death at admission had 
lower odds of being in the highest quartile for hospital death (AOR=0.36, 95% CI 0.14, 0.93) and 
ED visits (AOR=0.27, 95%CI 0.10–0.76). Hospices that reported more frequently monitoring 
symptoms had lower odds of being in the highest quartile for ICU stays (AOR=0.48, 95%CI 0.24–
0.94). In adjusted analyses, a higher proportion of patients at for-profit compared with nonprofit 
hospices experienced a hospital admission (15.3% versus 10.9%, P<0.001), ED visit (21.8% 
versus 15.6%, P<0.001), and ICU stay (5.1% versus 3.0%, P<0.001).
Conclusions—Hospitalization of patients following hospice enrollment varies substantially 
across hospices. Two of the six preferred practices examined were associated with hospitalization 
rates and for-profit hospices had persistently high hospitalization rates regardless of preferred 
practice implementation.
INTRODUCTION
The Affordable Care Act required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish 
quality reporting measures for hospice programs in the U.S. Under this Hospice Quality 
Reporting Program, all Medicare certified hospices are required to report quality measures 
related to pain and symptom screening and assessment, and the elicitation of patient 
preferences and spiritual or existential concerns in order to avoid a reduction of their annual 
payment update. The initiation of hospice quality reporting and the linking of reporting to 
reimbursement provides an incentive to improve the quality of care provided to the 1.65 
million individuals1 who receive hospice care each year, a group that has dramatically 
increased in both size and diversity in the past decade.2
Recent evidence regarding hospice quality3 has used measures derived from the work of the 
National Quality Forum, which endorsed a set of preferred practices for palliative and 
hospice care quality aimed at improving palliative and hospice care across the Institute of 
Medicine’s six dimensions of quality—safe, effective, timely, patient centered, efficient, and 
equitable.4 This evidence3 suggests that the implementation of hospice preferred practices 
such as the frequency of pain and symptom monitoring, existence of an on-call physician

 both evenings and weekends, and the timing of the assessment of patient preferences for care 
varied significantly by hospice characteristics. Specifically, our prior work using data from 
the National Hospice Survey found that the range of reported implementation of individual 
preferred practices among hospices was 45% to 97%.3 In adjusted analyses, larger hospices 
(100 or more patients per day) were significantly more likely than smaller hospices to report 
having implemented preferred practices, and, similarly, chain-affiliated hospices were 
significantly more likely than free-standing hospices to report having implemented preferred 
practices.3 What is missing from our prior work but is essential to building the evidence base 
for quality-based performance measurement is the link between specific hospice practices 
and patient and family outcomes at the end of life.
Accordingly, we sought to examine the associations between preferred hospice practices and 
hospitalization following hospice enrollment. Using data from the National Hospice Survey, 
we measured the reported use of hospice practices recommended by the National Quality 
Forum and the National Consensus Project and similar to those now utilized by the Hospice 
Quality Reporting Program. We measured outcomes using Medicare claims data from 
hospice enrollment to death for all patients cared for by the hospices in our survey. In doing 
so, we report the first national data on the link between hospice practices and outcomes for 
patients receiving hospice care. In addition, we report the association between hospice 
characteristics (including ownership, size and region) and these outcomes given the 
increasing body of evidence regarding variation in outcomes across hospice provider 
types.3, 5–12 Given that hospices have been required to report the Hospice Quality Reporting 
Program measures since July 2014, it is imperative to understand how these practices may 
relate to the care of patients at the end of life.
METHODS
Study Design and Sample
We conducted a longitudinal study using data for hospices that responded to our previously 
completed National Hospice Survey, linked to Medicare claims data for beneficiaries newly 
enrolled in responding hospices during the survey period September 2008 to November 
2009 (N=213,495). A total of 577 (98%) hospices in our survey were linked to Medicare 
claims data for beneficiaries; for 14 hospices, Medicare claims were unavailable, primarily 
because the hospice had merged/closed during the survey period. We excluded patients 
younger than age 66 (N=15,003) to ensure that individuals were eligible for Medicare in the 
year prior to hospice enrollment so that we could access data on comorbidities as possible 
confounding variables. We excluded patients not eligible for both Medicare Parts A and B 
(N=2,111) or who were enrolled in a managed care organization (N=46,567); eligibility for 
Medicare Part B is important for establishing outpatient claims and diagnoses for more 
accurate assessment of comorbidities,13 as has been done in previous research.6, 14–16 
Medicare managed care enrollees were not included because their claims and utilization data 
are not available in Medicare claims data. After our exclusion criteria were applied, our final 
sample was comprised of 149,814 individuals cared for by 577 hospices.

 National Hospice Survey Instrument and Claims Based Measures
As reported elsewhere,3, 11, 17 the National Hospice Survey was a national random sample of 
hospices surveyed between September 2008 and November 2009. We chose the random 
sample of hospices from the Medicare Provider of Services files, which include all hospices 
that participate in the Medicare program. We have completed surveys from 591 hospices, 
representing an 84% response rate, and representing approximately 20% of all Medicare 
certified hospices in the U.S. operating in 2009.
We developed the National Hospice Survey instrument after a comprehensive review of 
published guidelines from the National Quality Forum and the National Consensus Project 
and included preferred practices that were specific to hospice care and that were measurable 
at the level of the hospice agency. Given that the guidelines were relatively new at the time 
of our survey development, they at times lacked specific operational metrics for defining 
high quality practices. In these instances, we operationalized these measures to enable their 
assessment. For example, the National Consensus Project guideline 2.1 calls for “regular, 
ongoing assessment of pain [and] nonpain symptoms…”18 Our National Hospice Survey 
measure is whether or not a hospice measures pain at least every few days and symptoms at 
least every few days. Questions relating to the frequency with which hospices monitor pain 
and symptoms are specific to patients receiving hospice in a home rather than an inpatient 
hospice setting, given that more than 93% of hospice patient care days are provided in a 
home setting.19 The survey instrument consisted predominantly of closed-ended items and 
was pre-tested with 16 hospices to assess the clarity and comprehensiveness of survey 
questions using cognitive interviews with pre-test respondents. In this analysis we included 
preferred practices (Table 1) reported by hospices that we hypothesized to be related to the 
following hospital utilization-based outcomes: hospitalization, emergency department (ED) 
visits, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and hospital death. In addition, we evaluated 
hospitalizations and ED visits within the first 2 weeks after hospice enrollment as these 
outcomes are more proximal to the hospice admission procedures.
The survey also included questions regarding descriptive characteristics of hospices 
including: ownership (for-profit, nonprofit, government/other), whether the hospice was part 
of a chain of hospices, size (number of patients per day in the past 12 months), proportion of 
patients served in the nursing home, and the census region of the hospice.
We used Medicare hospice claims data to obtain patient demographic and clinical 
characteristics including age (categorized as 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, and >=85 years), 
gender, race/ethnicity (white, black, other), and primary diagnosis based on International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. We obtained information 
regarding the number of chronic conditions by examining all Medicare hospital inpatient and 
outpatient claims for each individual for the 12 months prior to their hospice enrollment. We 
measured hospice length of stay for each patient using the Medicare hospice claims data.
We also used Medicare claims data to measure the following utilization based outcomes 
from the time of a beneficiary’s hospice enrollment to his/her death: one or more 
hospitalizations, one or more ED visits, ICU admission, and hospital death.

 Statistical Analysis
Our prior work estimated the proportion of hospices that reported having implemented each 
of the preferred practices shown in Table 1.3 Using the patient-level Medicare claims data, 
we estimated the characteristics of each hospice’s patient population as follows: average age, 
percent female, percent white race, percent with cancer as primary diagnosis, percent with a 
mental disorder as primary diagnosis, average number of chronic conditions, and median 
length of hospice stay. We estimated the proportion of each hospice’s patients who 
experienced the following utilization-based outcomes from the time of their hospice 
enrollment to their death: one or more hospitalizations, one or more ED visits, ICU 
admission, and hospital death. We evaluated the distribution of these outcomes across 
hospices and identified hospices in the top quartile for each outcome.
We used multivariable logistic regression models at the level of the hospice to estimate the 
adjusted associations between a hospice being in the top quartile of the distribution for a 
utilization-based outcome and each hospice preferred practice, controlling for hospice 
organizational characteristics (ownership, chain affiliation, size, urban location and region) 
and patient population characteristics (average age, percent female, percent white race, 
percent with a primary diagnosis of cancer, percent with a primary diagnosis of a mental 
disorder, percent of patients cared for in a nursing home, average number of chronic 
conditions, and median length of hospice stay). To determine the impact of hospice preferred 
practices during the initial 2 weeks following enrollment, we re-estimated the multivariable 
logistic regression model evaluating the hospitalization and ED outcomes after limiting the 
timeframe to the first 2 weeks after hospice enrollment.
We used multivariable linear regression models at the level of the hospice to estimate the 
adjusted associations between the existence of hospice preferred practices and the proportion 
of patients hospitalized, admitted to the ED, admitted to the ICU, or who died in the 
hospital, controlling for hospice organizational and patient population characteristics. We 
used the margins post-estimation command to estimate the adjusted proportions of each 
hospitalization outcome by hospice organizational and patient population characteristics. We 
performed analyses using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) 
and Stata software, version 13.
RESULTS
Study Population
Our sample of Medicare beneficiaries was composed of 149,814 patients who were newly 
enrolled with one of the 577 hospices that responded to the National Hospice Survey (Table 
2). The majority of our sample was older than 80 years, female, and white. Approximately 
one-third of the sample had a primary diagnosis of cancer, one-fifth had a primary diagnosis 
of a disease of the circulatory system and almost all individuals had more than one chronic 
condition. The median length of hospice stay for this cohort was 16 days and the 
interquartile range was 4 to 77 days. The demographic and clinical characteristics of our 
sample of hospice users as well as the characteristics of the sampled hospice providers are

 consistent with those of the overall population of Medicare beneficiaries using hospice and 
Medicare certified hospice providers.2, 20–21
The sample of hospices from the National Hospice Survey has been described 
elsewhere.3, 11, 17 Approximately half were for-profit, one-quarter were part of a chain of 
hospices, two-thirds were located in an urban area, and approximately half had fewer than 
50 patients per day on average (Table 2). The average proportion of patients per day cared 
for in their place of residence was 94.6 percent (standard deviation 15.1) including 25.3 
percent (standard deviation 21.8) in a nursing home.
Variation among Hospice Providers in Hospitalization-Based Outcomes
The variation in outcomes among hospice providers is shown in Figure 1. The average 
proportion of patients at each hospice who were admitted to the hospital was 12.8% 
(standard deviation (SD) 11.6%), and ranged from 0% of patients at some hospices to 55.6% 
(the 99th percentile) at other hospices. The average proportion of patients with ED visits was 
18.3% (SD 13.0%), and ranged from 0% of patients at some hospices to 72.7% (the 99th 
percentile) at other hospices. For ICU stays and hospital death, the proportions were smaller. 
The average proportion of patients at each hospice who spent time in the ICU was 3.9% (SD 
5.2%), and ranged from 0% of patients at some hospices to 26.6% (the 99th percentile) at 
other hospices and the average proportion of patients at each hospice who died in the 
hospital was 2.3% (SD 3.5%) ranging from 0% of patients to 18.2% (the 99th percentile) of 
patients.
The average proportion of patients across hospices with hospitalizations in the first 2 weeks 
following hospice enrollment was as follows: hospital admission 2.2% (SD 3.5%) and ED 
visits 3.9% (SD 4.4%).
Hospice Preferred Practices
In multivariable models, two of the six hospice preferred practices examined were 
statistically significantly associated with hospitalization outcomes (Table 3). Hospices that 
reported assessing patient preferences for site of death were less likely to be in the highest 
quartile for the proportion of patients who die in the hospital (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.14, 0.93) 
and the proportion of patients who visit the ED (OR=0.27, 95%CI 0.10, 0.76). In addition, 
hospices that reported monitoring symptoms at least every few days were less likely to be in 
the highest quartile for the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU (OR=0.48, 95% CI 
0.24, 0.94) than hospices that monitored symptoms less frequently. The unadjusted and 
adjusted proportions of patients hospitalized did not significantly differ across hospices with 
and without the measured preferred practices (not shown).
Hospice Characteristics
For-profit hospice ownership was significantly associated with three of the four 
hospitalization-based outcomes (Table 3). In adjusted analyses, for-profit hospices had more 
than twice the odds of being in the highest quartile for hospitalizations, ED visits, and ICU 
stays. In addition, both the unadjusted and adjusted proportions of patients experiencing a

 hospital admission, ED visit and ICU stay were higher at for-profit compared with nonprofit 
hospices (Table 4).
Other measured hospice characteristics were not consistently significantly associated with 
the hospitalization-based outcomes (Table 3). Notable exceptions were hospice urban 
location which was associated with lower odds of being in the highest quartile for hospital 
admissions and hospital death and regional variation finding that hospices in the North 
Central region had lower odds of being in the highest quartile for hospitalization, ED visits, 
ICU stays and hospital death than hospices in the South Atlantic region. The unadjusted and 
adjusted proportions of patients hospitalized yielded similar results for urban location and 
region (Table 4). Urban hospices had significantly lower proportions of patients hospitalized 
and visiting the ED compared with surburban/rural hospices. By region, hospices in the 
North Central and Mountain/Pacific regions had the lowest adjusted proportions of hospital 
admissions and ED visits of their patients.
DISCUSSION
We found that two of the six examined hospice preferred practices were associated with 
significantly lower hospitalization of patients following hospice enrollment. Specifically, 
hospices that reported assessing patient preferences for site of death at admission were less 
likely to be in the highest quartile for hospital death and ED use and hospices that reported 
monitoring symptoms more frequently were less likely to be in the highest quartile for ICU 
stays for their patient population. The other four examined preferred practices were not 
associated with hospitalization based outcomes. In addition, we found that despite preferred 
practice implementation, there was significant variation across hospices in hospitalization 
rates including higher hospitalization rates at for-profit hospices, and hospices in suburban 
or rural areas.
This magnitude of hospice level variation in outcomes is critical to understand as we move 
forward with quality reporting requirements and quality-based reimbursement measures. Our 
results suggest that although some preferred practices are moderately related to utilization 
based outcomes, it is the organization of the hospice itself in terms of ownership, and 
location that likely drive policies and decisions regarding hospitalization. This is consistent 
with our prior work3 which finds that some of these same characteristics explain variation in 
the implementation of preferred practices. Our current findings suggest that factors such as 
financial incentives relating to the hospitalization of hospice patients play out differently 
across hospice provider types and dominate the impact of preferred practices on outcomes. 
Specifically, the consistent positive association between for-profit ownership and 
hospitalization after accounting for variation in patient population characteristics (including 
length of hospice stay, case mix, and the proportion cared for in a nursing home) suggests 
that the hospitalization of individuals who had enrolled with hospice may be a means of 
shifting costs of care from the hospice organization to Medicare. Further research evaluating 
this issue is needed.
Our results are consistent with mounting evidence that factors beyond patient acuity and 
clinical characteristics affect healthcare utilization at the end of life.22–24 Treatment intensity

 at the end of life, as measured by hospitalizations, ICU use, and site of death, has 
significantly increased been 2000 and 2009.25 Despite the fact that use of hospice has been 
found to reduce these measures of treatment intensity,26–27 our results demonstrate fairly 
high rates of hospitalization and ED use within a subset of hospices in our sample even after 
controlling for patient population characteristics including primary diagnosis, number of 
comorbidities, and length of hospice stay. Although we identify specific hospice practices 
that may reduce hospitalizations, greater understanding of the hospitalization decision from 
the patient’s perspective, the family’s perspective and the hospice’s perspective is needed.
There are several limitations to our study. One limitation of this analysis is that the National 
Hospice Survey data regarding preferred practices were self-reported by hospices and thus 
may over or under estimate the true prevalence of preferred practices. Second, neither the 
National Hospice Survey data nor the Medicare hospice claims data include information 
regarding the frequency with which clinical care processes were received by patients. We 
also do not know the content of patient and family preferences for care and thus the 
congruence of hospitalization outcomes with care preferences, however, we would expect 
such preferences for or against hospitalization to be fairly evenly distributed across hospices. 
Similarly, we do not have data on other important patient and family outcomes such as 
satisfaction with care, pain and other symptoms, and quality of life. In addition, the National 
Quality Forum guidelines were relatively new at the time of our survey development and, in 
some cases, lacked specific operational metrics for defining high quality practices. A 
strength of our study, however, is that we operationalized and then measured these preferred 
practices and established a baseline for future assessments of hospices’ implementation of 
preferred practices. It is possible that hospice preferred practices changed during the follow-
up period, however, although our entire follow-up period ended in 2011, the median number 
of days in hospice for this cohort was only 16, with an inter-quartile range of 4 to 77 days. 
Ninety percent of patients had died within 240 days. Therefore, for the vast majority of 
patients, outcomes were assessed within 8 months of our quality assessment. Given that our 
study is observational, another limitation is that there may be unmeasured confounders, 
however, we have included a fairly comprehensive set of both hospice and patient population 
characteristics in our multivariable models. Finally, our results are not generalizable to the 
approximately 7% of hospices in the U.S. that do not participate in the Medicare program,1 
hospice users who are not Medicare beneficiaries, and hospice users who are enrolled in 
managed care organizations.
Numerous studies indicate that the majority of individuals in the U.S prefer not to have 
intensive hospital-based care when they die28–29 and would prefer to die at home.30–32 
Individuals who die at home have been found to have greater quality of life and fewer unmet 
needs compared with those who die in the hospital.33–34 Transitions to the hospital at the 
end of life can lead to aggressive interventions, medical errors, and adverse reactions for 
patients.35–36 Even caregivers of individuals who die at home with hospice have been found 
to have improved outcomes compared with caregivers of those who die in the ICU.25 We 
found that some practices – namely assessing patient preferences for site of death at hospice 
admission and more frequent symptom monitoring – reduce hospitalizations and thus may 
be important to implement for the 17% and 29%, respectively, of hospices who may not 
already engage in these practices. Policy levers including monitoring, licensure, or payment

 reform linked to the implementation of these types of hospice practices may provide 
incentives for greater implementation. Our results also highlight the need to better 
understand the practices of for-profit hospices where the pattern of high hospitalization of 
patients is persistent, regardless of preferred practice implementation. The substantial 
hospice level variation in hospitalization-based outcomes identified in this study underscores 
the need to better understand the drivers of inter-hospice variation, to develop quality 
measures based on these determinants, and to create incentives for high performance on 
quality measures to improve the experiences of patients and families at the end of life.

The adjusted proportion of each outcome was calculated including the following covariables: the existence of hospice preferred practices (physician on-call 24/7, monitoring of pain at least every few days, 
monitoring of symptoms at least every few days, patient goals of care assessed at admission, family preferences for care assessed at admission, and patient preferences for site of death assessed at 
admission), characteristics of the hospice’s patient population (average age, percent female, percent white race, percent with cancer as primary diagnosis, percent with mental disorder as primary diagnosis, 
average number of chronic conditions percent of patients in the nursing home, and median length of hospice stay) and characteristics of the hospice (ownership, chain affiliation, size, urban location and 
region).
