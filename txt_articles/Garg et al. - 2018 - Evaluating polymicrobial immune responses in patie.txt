There is insufficient evidence to support screening of various tick-borne diseases (TBD) related microbes 
alongside Borrelia in patients suffering from TBD. To evaluate the involvement of multiple microbial 
immune responses in patients experiencing TBD we utilized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Four 
hundred and thirty-two human serum samples organized into seven categories followed Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention two-tier Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis guidelines and Infectious Disease 
Society of America guidelines for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. All patient categories were 
tested for their immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) responses against 20 microbes associated with 
TBD. Our findings recognize that microbial infections in patients suffering from TBDs do not follow 
the one microbe, one disease Germ Theory as 65% of the TBD patients produce immune responses to 
various microbes. We have established a causal association between TBD patients and TBD associated 
co-infections and essential opportunistic microbes following Bradford Hill’s criteria. This study indicated 
an 85% probability that a randomly selected TBD patient will respond to Borrelia and other related TBD 
microbes rather than to Borrelia alone. A paradigm shift is required in current healthcare policies to 
diagnose TBD so that patients can get tested and treated even for opportunistic infections.
Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) have become a global public health challenge and will affect over 35% of the global 
population by 20501. The most common tick-borne bacteria are from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) 
group. However, ticks can also transmit co-infections like Babesia spp.2, Bartonella spp.3, Brucella spp.4–8, 
Ehrlichia spp.9, Rickettsia spp.10,11, and tick-borne encephalitis virus12–14. In Europe and North America, 4–60% 
of patients with Lyme disease (LD) were co-infected with Babesia, Anaplasma, or Rickettsia11,15,16. Evidence from 
mouse and human studies indicate that pathogenesis by various tick-borne associated microbes15–17 may cause 
immune dysfunction and alter, enhance the severity, or suppress the course of infection due to the increased 
microbial burden18–22. As a consequence of extensive exposure to tick-borne infections15–17, patients may develop 
a weakened immune system22,23, and present evidence of opportunistic infections such as Chlamydia spp.24–27, 
Coxsackievirus28, Cytomegalovirus29, Epstein-Barr virus27,29, Human parvovirus B1924, and Mycoplasma spp.30,31. 
In addition to tick-borne co-infections and non-tick-borne opportunistic infections, pleomorphic Borrelia per-
sistent forms may induce distinct immune responses in patients by having different antigenic properties com-
pared to typical spirochetes32–35. Nonetheless, current LD diagnostic tools do not include Borrelia persistent 
forms, tick-borne co-infections, and non-tick-borne opportunistic infections.
The two-tier guidelines36–38 for diagnosing LD by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have 
been challenged due to the omission of co-infections and non-tick-borne opportunistic infections crucial for 
comprehensive diagnosis and treatment39,40. Emerging diagnostic solutions have demonstrated the usefulness of 
multiplex assays to test for LD and tick-borne co-infections41,42. However, these new technologies do not address 
seroprevalence of non-tick-borne opportunistic infections in patients suffering from TBD and they are limited 
to certain co-infections41,42. Non-tick-borne opportunistic microbes can manifest an array of symptoms24,29 con-
cerning the heart, kidney, musculoskeletal, and the central nervous system as seen in patients with Lyme related 
carditis43, nephritis44, arthritis45, and neuropathy46, respectively. Therefore, Chlamydia spp., Coxsackievirus,

Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Human parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma spp., and other non-tick-borne 
opportunistic microbes play an important role in the differential diagnosis of LD24,29. As the current knowl-
edge regarding non-tick-borne opportunistic microbes is limited to their use in differential diagnosis of LD, it 
is unclear if LD patients can present both tick-borne co-infections and non-tick-borne opportunistic infections 
simultaneously.
For the first time, we evaluate the involvement of Borrelia spirochetes, Borrelia persistent forms, tick-borne 
co-infections, and non-tick-borne opportunistic microbes together in patients suffering from different stages of 
TBD. To highlight the need for multiplex TBD assays in clinical laboratories, we utilized the Bradford Hill’s causal 
inference criteria47 to elucidate the likelihood and plausibility of TBD patients responding to multiple microbes 
rather than one microbe. The goal of this study is to advocate screening for various TBD microbes including 
non-tick-borne opportunistic microbes to decrease the rate of misdiagnosed or undiagnosed48 cases thereby 
increasing the health-related quality of life for the patients39, and ultimately influencing new treatment protocol 
for TBDs.
Results
Positive IgM and IgG responses by CDC defined acute, CDC late, CDC negative, PTLDS immunocompromised, 
and unspecific patients to 20 microbes associated with TBD (Fig. 1) were utilized to evaluate polymicrobial infec-
tions (Figs 2–4). Furthermore, IgM and IgG responses from healthy individuals and patients from the remaining 
six categories with previous test results (Fig. 1, Table S1) were included for receiver operating characteristics 
(ROC) and diagnostic performance assessments (Figs 5 and S4–S6).
Immune responses to multiple TBD associated microbes at all stages of TBDs. 
In Fig. 2A, 51% 
and 65% of patients had IgM and IgG responses to more than one microbe, whereas 9% and 16% of patients had 
IgM and IgG responses to only one microbe, respectively. On average, 23% and 31% of patients had IgM and 
IgG responses for each of the microbes, respectively (Fig. 2B). The Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q plot implied that 
patient responses to 20 microbes were normally distributed for IgM and IgG (Fig. S1). Immune responses to

laboratories. Patient samples that arrived without information regarding TBD related symptoms, clinical test 
results or the diagnosis by a healthcare professional were excluded (n = 77). Remaining 432 patients were tested 
for their IgM and IgG responses against 20 microbes associated with TBDs. Further, included patients were 
organized into seven categories based on their respective clinical pictures that followed the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) two-tier diagnosis guidelines for Lyme disease, Infectious Disease Society of 
America (IDSA) guidelines for Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS), and literature regarding the 
use of lymphocyte and low CD57 cell count in diagnosing patients for Lyme disease. Patient categories included 
CDC acute (n = 43), CDC late (n = 43), CDC negative (n = 46), PTLDS (n = 31), immunocompromised 
(n = 61), unspecific (n = 31), and healthy (n = 177).

Borrelia persistent forms (all three species) for IgM and IgG were 5–10% higher compared to Borrelia spirochetes 
in all three species (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the probability that a randomly selected patient will respond to Borrelia 
persistent forms rather than the Borrelia spirochetes (Fig. S2) is 80% (d = 1.2) for IgM and 68% for IgG (d = 0.7). 
Figure 2A and B indicated that IgM and IgG responses by patients from different stages of TBDs are not limited 
to only Borrelia spirochetes.
Patients from the seven categories demonstrated IgM and IgG responses to multiple microbes (Fig. 2C). On 
average, 32% and 23% of individuals from the CDC defined acute category had IgM and IgG responses to various 
microbes, respectively. In the CDC defined late category, the corresponding percentages were 31% and 44%. 
Surprisingly, about 13% of the CDC defined negative patients had IgM and 36% had IgG responses to different

microbes. Remarkably, 72% of the CDC defined negative patients responded to at least one Borrelia species’ 
persistent form (Fig. S2). In the PTLDS category, the average percentage of individuals that responded to several 
microbes were 27% for IgM and 33% for IgG. The odds that a PTLDS patient at random will respond to Borrelia 
persistent forms rather than the Borrelia spirochetes are 76% (d = 1.0) for IgM and an astonishing 95% (d = 2.4) 
for IgG (Fig. S2). Furthermore, roughly 22% and 30% of individuals from the immunocompromised category had 
IgM and IgG responses to different microbes, respectively. For patients in the unspecific category, 12% had IgM 
and 18% had IgG responses to multiple microbes. In addition, the two-tailed Fisher’s exact test revealed that 90% 
of IgM responses and 97.5% of the IgG responses to 20 microbes (Table 1) by patients from CDC defined acute, 
CDC late, CDC negative, PTLDS, immunocompromised and unspecific categories were statistically different (i.e., 
p ≤
 0.05) from healthy individuals (Fig. S3). Results from Fig. 2C suggested that polymicrobial infections in these 
patients are not limited to a particular stage of TBD.

Immune reponses to multiple species of Borrelia spirochetes and persistent forms. 
In Fig. 3, 
26% of the patients presented an IgM response to both spirochetes and persistent forms whereas only 2% 
responded to spirochetes and 13% to persistent forms alone. Similarly, 39% of the patients had an IgG response to 
both spirochetes and persistent forms compared to 7% and 13% that responded to only the spirochetes or persis-
tent forms, respectively. It was noted that 40% and 20% of the patients did not produce an IgM and IgG response, 
respectively against Borrelia spirochete and the persistent forms (Table 1). Figure 3 sub-inlets (Fig. 3A.1, A.2, B.1 
and B.2) indicate individual strains of Borrelia that the patients were responding to in the initial category (i.e. spi-
rochetes or persistent forms alone). In Fig. 3 sub-inlets, more than 50% of the patients reacted to only the individ-
ual Borrelia strains suggesting that Borrelia antigens are not cross-reactive. If patients were cross-reacting among 
antigens, a larger percentage of the patients would be seen with the combination of all three species (Fig. S2). 
These results provide evidence to suggest that the inclusion of different Borrelia species and their morphologies 
in current LD diagnostic tools will improve its efficiency.
Immune responses to Borrelia and TBD related microbes versus immune responses to only 
Borrelia. 
The difference in percentages of patients responding to only Borrelia (8% for IgM, and 12% for IgG) 
compared to patients responding to Borrelia and many other TBD microbes (61% for IgM and IgG) was great 
(Fig. 4A). The probability that a randomly selected patient will respond to Borrelia and other TBD microbes 
rather than to only Borrelia is 88% (d = 1.7) for IgM and 83% (d = 1.4) for IgG (Fig. S2). Moreover, the highest 
percentage of IgM (42%) and IgG (43%) responses against other TBD microbes was demonstrated in patients that 
responded to both Borrelia spirochetes and persistent forms (Fig. 4A). These patients also had antibodies against 
the highest number (14 other TBD microbes) of other TBD microbes (Fig. 4B). On average, 70% of the patients 
demonstrated IgM and IgG antibodies to other specific TBD microbes together with spirochetes and persistent 
forms (Fig. 4C). Outstandingly large immune responses to many other microbes and Borrelia signified the pro-
found polymicrobial nature of tick-borne diseases (Fig. 4).
Clinical sensitivity and specificity. 
The coefficients of intra and inter-assay variations of these ELISA 
assays were 4.5% and 15%, respectively. Further, a minimum 0.875 area under the receiver operating character-
istic (ROC) curve (AUC) and p values < 0.001 were recorded for all forms of Borrelia in IgM, IgG, and collective 
IgM/IgG analyses (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the collective IgM/IgG ROC curves demonstrated the largest AUC 
values (max 0.961) compared to AUC values from only IgM (max 0.885) or IgG (max 0.920) ROC curves. AUC 
values closer to 1 and p values < 0.001 suggest that the test protocol can effectively distinguish between healthy 
individuals and LD patients, especially when collective IgM/IgG reactions are considered (Fig. 5B). Collective 
IgM/IgG responses offer the highest sensitivity (max 94%) compared to sensitivity values from only IgM (max 
64%) or IgG (max 88%). Similarly, the highest PPV (max 74%) was noted for collective IgM/IgG responses com-
pared to only IgM (max 70%) or IgG (max 72%). However, for the different forms of Borrelia, the difference in 
specificity (91 ± 4%) or NPV (95 ± 3%) among IgM, IgG, and collective IgM/IgG was minute. Figure 5 recom-
mends utilization of collective IgM/IgG responses to diagnose LD.
The collective IgM/IgG responses for all TBD associated co-infections and opportunistic infections exhibited 
largest AUC values. In Figs S4 and S5, AUC values for collective IgM/IgG responses ranged from 0.924 to 0.998.

Also, AUC values for only IgM ranged from 0.787 to 0.933, and for IgG from 0.769 to 0.975. For tick-borne 
associated co-infections, the sensitivity ranged from 80% for B. henselae with 100% PPV, 93% for E. chaffeensis 
with 68% PPV, to 100% for B. microti with 13% PPV (Fig. S6). Likewise, the specificity extended from 94% for B.

Discussions
To evaluate the involvement of polymicrobial infections in TBD, 432 patients diagnosed at different TBD stages 
were tested for their IgM and IgG immune responses to 20 microbes associated with TBDs (Fig. 1). The study out-
come indicated that polymicrobial infections existed at all stages of TBD with IgM and IgG responses to several 
microbes (Fig. 2). Additionally, IgM and IgG responses to multiple TBD associated co-infections and opportun-
istic infections were large in patients that reacted to Borrelia compared to patients with no reaction to Borrelia 
(Fig. 4). However, on average 20% patients responded (IgM and IgG) to only TBD associated co-infections and 
opportunistic infections that demonstrates the importance of other TBD microbes in addition to Borrelia (Fig. 3). 
Results presented in this study propose that infections in patients suffering from TBDs do not obey the one 
microbe one disease Germ Theory. Based on these results and substantial literature11,15–17,27,49–51 on polymicrobial 
infections in TBD patients, we examined the probability of a causal relationship between TBD patients and pol-
ymicrobial infections following Hill’s nine criteria47.

were included for ROC and diagnostic performance assessments (Figs 5 and S4–S6).

An average effect size of d = 1.5 for IgM and IgG (Fig. 4A) responses is considered very large52. According 
to common language effect size statistics53, d = 1.5 indicates 85% probability that a randomly selected patient 
will respond to Borrelia and other TBD microbes rather than to only Borrelia. Reports from countries such as 
Australia27, Germany49, Netherlands11, Sweden50, the United Kingdom51, the USA15,16, and others indicate that 
4% to 60% of patients suffer from LD and other microbes such as Babesia microti and human granulocytic ana-
plasmosis (HGA). However, previous findings11,15,16,27,49–51 are limited to co-infections (i.e., Babesia, Bartonella, 
Ehrlichia, or Rickettsia species) in patients experiencing a particular stage of LD (such as Erythema migrans). 
In contrast, a broader spectrum of persistent, co-infections, and opportunistic infections associated with diverse 
stages of TBD patients have been demonstrated in this study (Fig. 2). From a clinical standpoint, the likelihood 
for IgM and IgG immune responses by TBD patients to the Borrelia spirochetes versus the Borrelia persistent 
forms, and responses to just Borrelia versus Borrelia with many other TBD microbes has been quantified for the 
first time (Fig. S2).
Borrelia pathogenesis could predispose individuals to polymicrobial infections because it can suppress, sub-
vert, or modulate the host’s immune system18–22 to create a niche for colonization by other microbes54. Evidence in 
animals55 and humans11,15,16,27,49–51 frequently indicate co-existence of Borrelia with other TBD associated infec-
tions. Interestingly, IgM and IgG immune levels by patients to multiple forms of Borrelia resulted in immune 
responses to 14 other TBD microbes (Fig. 4B). In contrast, patient responses to either form of Borrelia (spiro-
chetes or persistent forms) resulted in reactions to an average of 8 other TBD microbes (Fig. 4B). Reaction to two 
forms of Borrelia reflected an increase in disease severity indicating biological gradient for causation as required 
by Hill’s criteria47.
Multiple microbial infections in TBD patients seem plausible because ticks can carry more than eight differ-
ent microbes depending on tick species and geography56,57. Moreover, Qiu and colleagues reported the presence 
of at least 18 bacterial genera shared among three different tick species and up to 127 bacterial genera in Ixodes 
persulcatus58. Interestingly, research indicates Chlamydia-like organism in Ixodes ricinus ticks and human skin59 
that may explain immune responses to Chlamydia spp., seen in this study (Fig. 2). Additionally, prevalence of 
TBD associated co-infections such as B. abortus, E. chaffeensis, and opportunistic microbes such as C. pneumo-
niae, C. trachomatis, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and M. pneumoniae have been recorded in the general 
population of Europe and the USA (Table S2). However, true incidence of these microbes is likely to be higher 
considering underreporting due to asymptomatic infections and differences in diagnostic practices and surveil-
lance systems across Europe and in the USA. More importantly, clinical evidence for multiple microbes has been 
reported in humans11,15,16,27,49–51, and livestock55 to mention the least. Our findings regarding the presence of 
polymicrobial infections at all stages of TBD further supports the causal relationship between TBD patients and 
polymicrobial infections (Fig. 2). Various microbial infections in TBD patients have been linked to the reduced 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and increased disease severity39.
An association between multiple infections and TBD patients relates well to other diseases such as periodon-
tal, and respiratory tract diseases. Oral cavities may contain viruses and 500 different bacterial species60. Our find-
ings demonstrate that TBD patients may suffer from multiple bacterial and viral infections (Fig. 4). In respiratory 
tract diseases, influenza virus can stimulate immunosuppression and predispose patients to bacterial infections 
causing an increase in disease severity61. Likewise, Borrelia can induce immunosuppression that may predispose 
patients to other microbial infections causing an increase in disease severity.
Traditionally, positive IgM immune reaction implies an acute infection, and IgG response portrays a dissem-
ination, persistent or memory immunity due to past infections. Depending on when TBD patients seek medical 
advice, the level of anti-Borrelia antibodies can greatly vary as an Erythema migrans (EM) develops and may 
present with IgM, IgG, collective IgM/IgG, or IgA62. This study recommends both IgM and IgG in diagnosing 
TBD (Figs 5 and S4–S6) as unconventional antibody profiles have been portrayed in TBD patients. Presence of 
long-term IgM and IgG antibodies have been reported in LD patients that were tested by the CDC two-tier sys-
tem. In 2001, Kalish and colleagues reported anti-Borrelia IgM or IgG persistence in patients that suffered from 
LD 10–20 years ago63. Similarly, Hilton and co-workers recorded persistent anti-Borrelia IgM response in 97% of 
late LD patients that were considered cured following an antibiotic treatment64.
Similar events of persistent IgM and IgG antibody reactions were demonstrated in patients treated for Borrelia 
arthritis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans65, chronic cutaneous borreliosis66, and Lyme neuroborreliosis67. 
A clear phenomenon of immune dysfunction is occurring, which might account for the disparities in LD patient’s 
antibody profiles and persistence. Borrelia suppresses the immune system by inhibition of antigen-induced lym-
phocyte proliferation18, reducing Langerhans cells by downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class 
II molecules on these cells19, stimulating the production of interleukin-10 and anti-inflammatory immunosup-
pressive cytokine20, and causing disparity in regulation and secretion of cytokines21. Other studies have demon-
strated low production or subversion of specific anti-Borrelia antibodies in patients with immune deficiency 
status22.
Following Hill’s nine criteria47 a causal association between TBD patients and polymicrobial infections can 
be established because the likelihood (Fig. S2F) of TBD patients responding to Borrelia and various other TBD 
microbes is substantial (strength of association). Evidence concerning immune responses to multiple forms 
of Borrelia and 14 other TBD microbes versus responses to either type of Borrelia and 8 other TBD microbes 
(Fig. 4B) explains Hill’s biological gradient criteria. Also, immune responses to several microbes at all stages of 
TBD (Fig. 2C) and the large difference in immune responses (Fig. 4A) by individuals to only Borrelia (10%) and

conditions. Finally, the role of polymicrobial infections in periodontal60, respiratory tract61, and other diseases 
fulfil Hill’s analogy criteria.
Our study has several limitations. First, commercial laboratories that contributed samples to our study had 
strict policies for patient de-identification and data protection. Thus, the demographic information such as age, 
sex, region and ethnicity relating to many patients included in this study are missing. Second, all Cohen’s d effect 
size analyses (Fig. S2) included in this study were substantively significant (Cohen’s d) but not statistically note-
worthy (t statistic). However, the statistically non-significant effect size is not futile because unlike the t statistic, 
Cohen’s d is independent of sample variability and size52,68.
In the USA alone, the economic healthcare burden for patients suffering from LD and ongoing symptoms is 
estimated to be $1.3 billion per year69. Additionally, 83% of all TBD diagnostic tests performed by the commercial 
laboratories in the USA accounted for only LD70. Globally, the commercial laboratories’ ability to diagnose LD 
has increased by merely 4% (weighted mean for ELISA sensitivity 62.3%) in the last 20 years71. This study pro-
vides evidence regarding polymicrobial infections in patients suffering from different stages of TBDs. Literature 
analyses and results from this study followed Hill’s criteria indicating a causal association between TBD patients 
and polymicrobial infections. Also, the study outcomes indicate that patients may not adhere to traditional IgM 
and IgG responses.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement. 
Left over and disregarded human sera collected was approved by the Federal Institute for 
Drugs and Medical Devices, Germany (project no. 95.10-5661-7066); and Western Institutional Review Board, 
United States of America (USA) (USMA201441, WIRB® protocol #20141439). Demographic information con-
cerning age, sex, and ethnicity of the patients was not provided for all sera samples included in this study due to 
the strict patient de-identification and data protection policies followed by contributing commercial laboratories. 
Sera samples that were provided with patient’s demographic information comprised adults and child partici-
pants. Written and informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in this study. In the case of child 
participants, written and informed consent was obtained either from a parent or a guardian. All methods were 
performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
Study design. 
Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) levels of all eligible patients (Fig. 1) were tested on an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against 20 microbial antigens (Table 1). Antigen selection included 
lysates or peptides for Borrelia and TBD associated co-infections and opportunistic infections (latter hereon 
collectively referred to as other TBD microbes). To evaluate polymicrobial infections in patients suffering from 
different stages of TBDs, patients were organized into seven categories according to their respective clinical diag-
nosis provided by healthcare professionals (Fig. 1).
Human serum sample collection and categorization. 
Between May 2014 and September 2016, 509 
human serum samples were received from clinical laboratories in Europe and the United States. Samples that 
arrived without information regarding TBD related symptoms, clinical test results or the diagnosis by a healthcare 
professional were excluded (Fig. 1). The remaining 432 patients (completion rate of 85%) were tested for their IgM 
and IgG responses against 20 microbes associated with TBDs (Table 1). Among the 432 patients, 347 (i.e., 80%) 
specimens were received from clinical laboratories and medical doctors across Europe. Likewise, remaining 85 
(i.e., 20%) sera samples were collected from clinical laboratories and medical doctors in the United States. Several 
sera samples included commercial diagnosis for other TBD microbes (Table S1). Eligible patients were organized 
into seven categories according to their respective clinical diagnosis as follows.
 1. CDC acute (n = 43). Patients suffered from flu-like symptoms, presented an EM rash, and tested positive 
for IgM serology utilizing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) two-tier Lyme disease (LD) 
diagnosis criteria36–38.
 2. CDC late (n = 43). Patients suffered from late LD symptoms (a headache, arthritic pain, joint pain, etc.) 
and tested positive for IgG serology utilizing CDC two-tier LD diagnosis criteria36–38. Also, patients suf-
fered from CDC approved late LD symptoms such as Lyme arthritis, carditis, or neurological symptoms 
that included sure signs and symptoms involving the heart, joints, peripheral or central nervous system37,72.
 3. CDC negative (n = 46). Patients suffered from a combination of flu-like symptoms and late LD symptoms 
but tested negative for IgM and IgG serology utilizing the CDC two-tier LD diagnosis criteria36–38.
 4. Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [PTLDS (n = 31)]. Patients were diagnosed with PTLDS by Lyme 
Literate Medical doctors according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines73,74.
 5. Immunocompromised (n = 61). Patients suffered from a combination of flu-like symptoms and late LD 
symptoms36–38. Patients were tested for low CD57 cell count and a negative immune response by lympho-
cyte cells to Borrelia antigens. Rational here is that if CD57 cell count is low, then the patient would be 
persistent or progressive with LD75–77.
 6. Unspecific (n = 31). Patients suffered from a combination of flu-like symptoms and late LD that followed 
CDC two-tier LD diagnosis criteria36–38. However, no test results were provided to support and reason with 
the documented symptoms. Thus, the category was termed as “unspecific”
.
 7. Healthy (n = 177) for each antibody type (77 for IgM, 77 for IgG, and 23 for both IgM and IgG). Individu-
als did not suffer from any combination of flu-like symptoms and late LD symptoms36–38. Healthy individ-
uals tested negative for IgM and IgG serology utilizing the CDC two-tier LD diagnosis criteria36–38. Also, 
healthy blood donors were included.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure. 
All microbial peptides (Table 1) were 
synthesized at >95% purity by GeneCust, Luxembourg. High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Mass 
Spectrometry were utilized by GeneCust to ensure specified peptide quality. The protein concentrations of cell 
lysates were measured with ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Finnzymes) at 280 nm. Fresh antigen stock solutions 
(1 mg/ml) were diluted at 1:100 in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (0.1 M Na2CO3/0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.5). Dilution vol-
ume was equally divided among stock solutions for microbes with two peptide sequences. Human IgM (Sigma) 
and human IgG (Sigma) were utilized as positive controls in this study. Additionally, human IgM and human IgG 
were interchangeably used as negative control for each other. The control stock solutions were diluted similarly 
as antigens.
Flat bottom 96-well polystyrene ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 100 µl of antigens and controls as 
duplicates and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Post incubation, the plates were washed three times with 300 µl 
of PBS-Tween (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) using DNX-9620G (Nanjing Perlove Medical Equipment Co., Ltd) 
microplate washer and were then coated with 100 µl of 2% BSA (Sigma) in PBS. After an overnight incubation 
at 4 °C, the 2% BSA in PBS was discarded. Further, 100 µl of patient serum diluted at 1:200 in 1% BSA/PBS was 
added. The plates were then allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at room temperature (RT). Post incubation, the plates 
were washed five times with 300 µl of PBS-Tween. An amount of 100 µl of Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) con-
jugated to mouse anti-human IgG (Abcam) or rabbit anti-human IgM (Antibodies Online) was introduced to 
the plates at 1:10000 or 1:1000 dilution factor, respectively. After 1.5 hr incubation at RT, the plates were washed 
five times with 300 µl of PBS-Tween and were then supplemented with 100 µl of 3,3′
,5,5′
 tetramethylbenzidine 
substrate (TMB, Thermo-Pierce). Plates containing HRP conjugated to mouse anti-human IgG or IgM were 
incubated at RT for 5 min or 1 hr, respectively. The catalytic reaction between anti-human antibodies and TMB 
substrate was stopped by adding 100 µl of 2 M H2SO4. VictorTM X4 multi-label plate reader (Perkin Elmer) was 
utilized to measure the optical density (OD) values at 450 nm at 0.1 sec.
ELISA data compilation for statistical and graphical analyses. 
Duplicate OD values for each anti-
gen were assessed to be within 30% range of each other78–81. To establish cut-off values for IgM and IgG of each 
antigen, values from healthy category were used. Cut-off values were established by adding mean of all average 
OD values to three times the standard deviation of all average OD values79,80. In the next step, an optical density 
index (ODI) dataset was created for all patient categories by dividing average OD values of microbes by their 
respective cut-off values. Finally, ODI values ≤
 0.8, 0.8 ≤
 0.99, and ≥
1 were coded as 0, 2, and 1, respectively. 
ODI values ≤
 0.8, 0.8 ≤
 0.99, and ≥
1 represent negative, borderline, and positive immune responses by patients, 
respectively. For all antigens, borderline responses were combined with positive results82 because literature is rife 
with evidence regarding immune dysfunction in TBD patients62–67,83–91. In all graphical analyses, IgM and IgG 
responses to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii were grouped as spirochetes. To 
Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii persistent forms were grouped as persistent 
forms. Responses to the three species for Borrelia and their different morphological forms were grouped as spi-
rochetes and persistent forms. Finally, patients with IgM and IgG response to only other TBD microbes and not 
Borrelia were grouped.
Statistical analyses. 
To validate positive patient response distribution curve among 20 microbes, 
Shapiro-Wilk test92 was computed using SPSS. Shapiro-Wilk test results were verified using the normal Q-Q plot 
for IgM and IgG92. Cohen’s d52,93 effect size with 95% confidence interval (CI)94 was calculated to measure the 
strength of association and probability of superiority among various experimental and control groups such as 
patients that responded to Borrelia and multiple other TBD microbes (experimental group) versus patients that 
responded to only Borrelia (control group). An effect size of d ≥
 0.2, d ≥
 0.5, d ≥
 0.8, and d ≥
 1 was considered 
small, medium, large, and very large, respectively52,93. For each Cohen’s d estimation, a two-tailed t-test assuming 
unequal variance among the experimental and control groups was performed95. The t-test results p ≤
 0.05 were 
considered statistically significant95. Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to assess if the IgM and IgG responses 
to 20 microbes (Table 1) by patients from the CDC defined acute, CDC late, CDC negative, PTLDS, immunocom-
promised, and unspecific categories were statistically different (i.e., p ≤
 0.05) compared to healthy individuals. 
GraphPad Software was utilized to perform the two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. The coefficient of variation (CV) 
was assessed by calculating intra- and inter-assay variation96. Intra-assay variation was determined by a duplicate 
high titer and low titer measurement from the same plate. For inter-assay, variation was determined by measur-
ing six high titer samples and six low titer samples from different plates that were performed on different days by 
different operators.
Nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created in SPSS97–99 to evaluate the diag-
nostic assay’s ability to discriminate between healthy individuals and TBD patients. Parameters to understand 
ROC curves included area under the curve (AUC) with 95% CI100, and p values (p < 0.05 were interpreted signif-
icant)97–99. Diagnostic performance characteristics for each antigen such as sensitivity, specificity, positive pre-
dictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) with 95% CI100 were calculated by a corresponding 
previous clinical diagnosis of patients with ELISA results from this study. MEDCALC® was utilized for calcu-
lating performance characteristics. ROC curves and performance characteristics for Brucella abortus, Rickettsia 
akari, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, Human parvovirus B19, and Mycoplasma fermentans were not calculated 
due to insufficient clinical data. ROC curves and diagnostic performance parameters were analyzed for IgM, IgG, 
and collective IgM/IgG responses. For collective IgM/IgG analyses, positive or borderline response to an antigen 
in either IgM or IgG was considered positive. A negative response to an antigen in both IgM and IgG was regarded 
as negative.

Causal inference and epidemiology search strategy. 
This study attempts to establish a causal relation-
ship between TBD patients and multiple microbial infections following Bradford Hill’s nine criteria that includes 
strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experiment, and anal-
ogy47. Strength requires a statistically significant association between TBD patients and multiple microbial infec-
tions. In the next step, literature was obtained from various countries concerning polymicrobial infections in TBD 
patients that will fulfil the consistency, plausibility, and coherence criteria. IgM or IgG immune responses by TBD 
patients to many microbes (Table 1) in the presence of an immune response to a specific or group of microbes 
will confirm the specificity and experiment criteria. Further, to prove temporality, it is essential to understand if 
those particular microbes can dispose TBD patients to multiple microbial infections. An increase in IgM or IgG 
response to microbes that confirm Hill’s specificity should also boost response to many microbes to display bio-
logical gradient. Lastly, evidence concerning multiple microbial infections in diseases other than TBD will fulfil 
the analogy criteria.
CDC and European CDC (ECDC) reports were utilized to review the incidence rate per 100,000 population 
in U.S.A. and Europe for TBD associated co-infections and opportunistic microbes (Table 1). In cases where CDC 
or ECDC reports were unavailable, PubMed and Google Scholar assisted. The search query used in PubMed and 
Google Scholar included a name for the microbe followed by the phrase “incidence rate and U.S.A.” or “incidence 
rate and Europe”; for example, Babesia microti incidence rate and U.S.A. or Babesia microti incidence rate and 
Europe (Table S2).
