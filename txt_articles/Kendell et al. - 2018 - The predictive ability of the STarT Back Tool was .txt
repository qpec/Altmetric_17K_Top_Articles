Introduction
Chronic low back pain (LBP) is problematic for many people,
and has significant personal, social, and economic impact.
Worldwide, LBP is the leading cause of years lived with disability.1
The economic burden of LBP in Australia is substantial.2 Healthcare
practices require more effective and affordable strategies to better
manage the rising burden of LBP3 and direct resources to those
most in need.
Evidence-based guidelines4,5 highlight the need to screen for
indicators of poor prognosis and/or stratify patients with LBP
based on risk. The STarT Back Tool (SBT) (http://www.keele.ac.uk/
sbst/startbacktool/)6 was developed to allow primary care/first-
contact practitioners to subgroup patients with non-specific LBP
into low risk, medium risk, and high risk of future disability, with
the purpose of matching each subgroup to a care pathway. The
nine-item SBT includes treatment-modifiable domains such as
spread of pain, disability, and psychological factors.7 A randomised
trial demonstrated that a risk stratification approach based on the
SBT resulted in better clinical outcomes and reduced costs
compared to usual care in a primary care cohort in the United
Kingdom.8
Initial development and validation of the SBT was undertak-
en in a United Kingdom primary care, general practice setting
where participants had non-specific LBP of ‘variable’ episode
duration (ie, acute/subacute/chronic LBP).7 There is a growing
body of evidence supporting the SBT’s psychometric properties
and predictive and discriminative ability particularly in popula-
tions with LBP of variable episode duration.7,9–17 To date, only
two studies have evaluated the SBT in a population with
exclusively18 or predominantly19 chronic LBP. Studies have
shown that the SBT’s performance has differed depending on
the population in which it was evaluated, with clinical setting,
cultural context, LBP episode duration, treatment provided, and
outcome measure evaluated all influencing the tool’s predictive
performance.9,10,12,16–22 Authors have recommended that the
SBT be evaluated in different populations15,16,20 and that LBP
episode duration be considered.21
The SBT risk subgroups have not been profiled nor has the tool’s
predictive and discriminative ability been adequately investigated

Questions: In people with chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP), what is the predictive and
discriminative validity of the STarT Back Tool (SBT) for pain intensity, self-reported LBP-related disability,
and global self-perceived change at 1-year follow-up? What is the profile of the SBT risk subgroups with
respect to demographic variables, pain intensity, self-reported LBP-related disability, and psychological
measures? Design: Prospective cohort study. Participants: A total of 290 adults with dominant axial LBP
of � 3 months’ duration recruited from the general community, and private physiotherapy, psychology,
and pain-management clinics in Western Australia. Outcome measures: The 1-year follow-up measures
were pain intensity, LBP-related disability, and global self-perceived change. Results: Outcomes were
collected on 264 participants. The SBT categorised 82 participants (28%) as low risk, 116 (40%) as medium
risk, and 92 (32%) as high risk. The risk subgroups differed significantly (p < 0.05) on baseline pain,
disability, and psychological scores. The SBT’s predictive ability was strongest for disability: RR was 2.30
(95% CI 1.28 to 4.10) in the medium-risk group and 2.86 (95% CI 1.60 to 5.11) in the high-risk group. The
SBT’s predictive ability was weaker for pain: RR was 1.25 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.51) in the medium-risk group
and 1.26 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.52) in the high-risk group. For the SBT total score, the AUC was 0.71 (95% CI
0.64 to 0.77) for disability and 0.63 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.71) for pain. Conclusion: This was the first large
study to investigate the SBT in a population exclusively with chronic LBP. The SBT provided an acceptable
indication of 1-year disability, had poor predictive and discriminative ability for future pain, and was
unable to predict or discriminate global perceived change. In this cohort with chronic non-specific LBP,
the SBT’s predictive and discriminative abilities were restricted to disability at 1 year. [Kendell M, Beales

 in a population exclusively with chronic LBP. While the SBT is
commonly used in Australia, it is yet to be evaluated in an
Australian context. If the SBT is to be used with confidence in
Australia for patients presenting with chronic LBP, the tool’s
performance must be evaluated in this group.
Therefore, the research questions for this prospective cohort
study were:
1. In people with chronic non-specific LBP, what is the predictive
and discriminative validity of the SBT for pain intensity, self-
reported LBP-related disability, and global self-perceived change
at 1-year follow-up?
2. What is the profile of the SBT risk subgroups with respect to
demographic variables, pain intensity, self-reported LBP-related
disability, and psychological measures?
Method
Design
This prospective cohort study had a 1-year follow-up. Data for
this study were obtained from a prospective cohort study that
evaluated the presence of multidimensional subgroups and
reported on multidimensional prognostic modelling in a popula-
tion with chronic non-specific LBP.23–26 These prior publications
did not consider the SBT risk subgroups and did not use the SBT
data in any analyses.
Participants
Participants were recruited from the general community via
multimedia advertisements in metropolitan and rural Western
Australia, as well as private physiotherapy, psychology and pain-
management clinics in Perth, Western Australia. The eligibility
criteria have been published in detail previously.23–26 In brief,
participants were required to: be aged 18 to 70 years; have dominant
axial non-specific LBP with the ratio of back:leg pain � 60%; have had
the pain for � 3 months; report an average baseline pain intensity in
the previous week of � 2 on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale; and
report LBP-related disability of � 5 on the Roland-Morris Disability
Questionnaire. Exclusion criteria were: inability to understand
English, pregnancy, a diagnosed neurological condition, serious
spinal pathology, or spinal surgery in the previous 6 months.
Baseline measures
Eligible participants completed a standardised self-report
questionnaire pack, which included questions related to demo-
graphic variables (age, gender, education level, employment status,
occupation, compensation status, pain duration, and overall
general health), the SBT, and psychological questionnaires, as
shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
Follow-up measures
At 1-year follow-up, participants completed an online or paper
questionnaire that included: average pain intensity in the previous
week measured on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale where
0 indicated ‘no pain’ and 10 indicated ‘the worst pain imaginable’;
LBP-related disability measured by the Roland-Morris Disability
Questionnaire; and global perceived change measured by a single
self-report item on a 7-point Global Rating of Change Scale. For
global perceived change, participants were asked: ‘With respect to
your low back pain, how would you describe yourself now
compared to 1 year ago when we examined you for the research
project (laboratory session at Curtin University)?’27 Responses
ranged from �3 indicating ‘very much worse’ to 3 indicating ‘very
much improved’.
Follow-up measures were dichotomised into ‘recovered’ and ‘not
recovered’.Notrecoveredforpainwasdefined asascore of � 3 onthe
Numerical Rating Scale.20Not recovered for disability was defined as
a score of � 7 on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire as per
prior investigations of the SBT.7,16,19,20 Not recovered/not improved
for global perceived change was defined as a score of � 0 on the
Global Rating of Change Scale (ie, no change or worse).
Data analysis
Questionnaire missing data were managed as suggested in
original manuscripts, where described. Otherwise, the average of
the relevant scale or subscale was used when one item was

 missing. When two or more items were missing, the questionnaire
score was coded as missing.
Baseline data analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic vari-
ables, clinical measures of pain intensity and disability, and
psychological measures, with respect to the total cohort and each
SBT risk subgroup. Subgroup differences for continuous demo-
graphic variables, clinical measures, and psychological measures
were examined using a one-way analysis of variance for normally
distributed variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for variables with
skewed data. Subgroup differences for categorical variables were
examined using the chi-squared test.
Follow-up data analysis
Comparisons between responders and non-responders at the 1-
year follow-up were made for demographic variables, baseline pain
intensity and disability, and SBT stratification. Depending on data
type and distribution, an independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney
U, or chi-squared test was used to evaluate these differences.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for follow-up pain
intensity, disability, and global perceived change for the total
cohort and for each SBT risk subgroup. The proportion of
participants not recovered at 1 year for each of the follow-up
measures was calculated at a cohort level and by SBT risk subgroup.
The predictive ability of the SBT was evaluated by calculating
the relative risk (RR) of non-recovery for participants classified by
the SBT as medium-risk or high-risk, using the low-risk subgroup
as the reference category. An RR of < 2.0 is unlikely to have much
practical value, an RR of 3.0 can be considered a moderate effect,
and an RR of 4.0 can be considered a strong effect.28
To evaluate the accuracy of the SBT baseline total score and
psychological subscale score to discriminate between recovered
and not recovered participants at follow-up, receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and the area under
the curve (AUC) calculated. Where follow-up measures had
significant AUC values, the positive likelihood ratio, negative
likelihood ratio, sensitivity, specificity, and the diagnostic odds
ratio (DOR) were calculated for: the low-risk group versus the
medium/high-risk group; and the low/medium-risk group versus
the high-risk group. The SBT risk subgroups were collapsed into
low/medium and medium/high, as this reflected the risk subgroup
cut-offs and facilitated comparison with previous studies.7,18,20 An
AUC of 0.50 suggests no discrimination, > 0.50 but < 0.70 poor
discrimination, � 0.70 
but < 0.80 
acceptable 
discrimination,
� 0.80 but < 0.90 excellent discrimination, and � 0.90 outstanding
discrimination.29 A higher positive likelihood ratio and lower
negative likelihood ratio indicate better discrimination.7 Likeli-
hood ratios > 5 or < 0.2 are generally seen as supporting a strong
test, whereas values close to 1 indicate poor test performance.20
The DOR ranges from 0 to infinity.30 A higher DOR indicates better
test discrimination, a value of 1 indicates that the test has no ability
to discriminate, and a value < 1 indicates that the test classifies
incorrectly.30
Because there have been a number of cut-off scores used in
previous studies to indicate non-recovery with respect to pain, a
sensitivity analysis was performed using a cut-off score of � 6 on
the Numerical Rating Scale. A sensitivity analysis was also
performed using linear regression to assess and compare the
proportion of variance explained by the SBT with pain, disability,
and global perceived change as scale variables rather than
dichotomised variables.
Results
Flow of participants through the study
The flow of participants through the study is shown in
Figure 1. Of the 290 participants included at baseline, 228 (79%)
were recruited from the general community, 59 (20%) from private
physiotherapy clinics, and three (1%) from private psychology and
pain management clinics. The 1-year follow-up data were available
for 264 (91%) participants. There was no significant difference
(p > 0.05) in age, gender, or baseline pain intensity between
responders and non-responders. Non-responders had higher
baseline disability than responders (Roland-Morris Disability

versus

back pain: a prospective cohort study. J Physiother. (2018), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphys.2018.02.009
 Cross sectional profile of the STarT Back Tool risk subgroups
Participant baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 and
Table 2. The SBT categorised 82 participants (28%) as low risk, 116
(40%) as medium risk, and 92 (32%) as high risk. The SBT risk
subgroups did not differ significantly for the majority of the
demographic variables, including pain duration. In contrast, pain
intensity (p � 0.001) and disability (p � 0.001) increased stepwise
from the low-risk group through to the high-risk group. In
addition, consistently greater negative psychological affect and
cognitions, decreasing self-efficacy, and decreasing chronic pain
acceptance were also seen from the low-risk group through to the
high-risk group (p � 0.001).
Predictive and discriminative ability of the STarT Back Tool
Participant characteristics at the 1-year follow-up are presented
inTable 3. Participants in both the medium-risk and high-risk groups
had a 25% increased risk of not being recovered with respect to pain
compared with the low-risk group (Figure 2). Participants in the
medium-risk group had a 130% increased risk, and those in the high-
risk group had a 186% increased risk of not being recovered with
respect to disability compared with the low-risk group. Although a
higher proportion of both the medium-risk group and the high-risk
group perceived themselves as not improved compared with the
low-risk group, the difference in risk was not statistically significant.
The ROC curves for the SBT total score and psychological subscale
score are shown in Figure 3. The SBT’s discriminative ability was
highest for disability, lower for pain, and the tool was unable to
discriminate global perceived change at 1 year (Table 4).
The likelihood ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and DORs for the
SBT risk subgroups for pain and disability at 1-year follow-up are
presented in Table 5. The positive likelihood ratios were higher and
the negative likelihood ratios were lower for disability compared
with those for pain.
The sensitivity analysis using a cut-off score of � 6 instead
of � 3 for pain resulted in similar AUC values (0.62 versus 0.63,
respectively). The sensitivity analysis using the follow-up measures
at a scale level rather than dichotomised gave the same results, in
that the SBT was significantly and most strongly predictive of
disability (r2 = 0.09), significantly but less predictive of pain
(r2 = 0.04), and not predictive of global perceived change (r2 = 0.00).
Discussion
This was the first large study to investigate the SBT in a
population exclusively with chronic non-specific LBP and in an
Australian context.
At baseline, those with a higher SBT risk categorisation had
significantly greater pain intensity, greater disability, higher scores

elevated levels of pain, disability, and negative psychological affect
and cognitions with reference to unidimensional questionnaires.
The SBT may be an acceptable surrogate measure for multiple full-
length unidimensional measures. Other authors have made similar
suggestions.11
The prospective results demonstrated that the SBT had
moderate predictive and acceptable discriminative ability for
disability 1 year later. However, the SBT’s predictive and discrimi-
native ability was poor for pain, and the tool was unable to identify

 participants who perceived themselves as improved versus not
improved at follow-up. Previous studies have reported that the
SBT’s prognostic ability was better for disability than pain,9,10,18,22
and that the SBT had little or no prognostic ability for global
perceived change regardless of population, setting, or follow-up
period.12,17,18 The SBT was originally developed and validated to
predict future disability,7 so it is not surprising that the tool
performed best with respect to this measure.
In comparison to a United Kingdom primary care setting, where
participants reported variable duration LBP (where approximately
60% and 30% of the cohort, respectively, reported chronic LBP),7,16
the SBT’s performance was weaker in the current study. There are a
number of possible explanations. The constructs included in the
SBT were those shown to be the strongest independent predictors
of disability in a United Kingdom primary care setting where
participants reported LBP of variable duration.7 Therefore, the
SBT’s constructs may not be as important for a cohort with chronic
LBP. Given the complex, multidimensional nature of chronic LBP, it
may be that the limited number of items and dichotomised
response format of the SBT was unable to adequately capture
prognostic risk in more complex patient presentations. Although
the brevity and simplicity of the SBT is one of its strengths, it may
also be a weakness when used in a population with chronic LBP.
Importantly, there are a large number of factors that may influence
prognosis prediction and future recovery that are unrelated to the
content of the SBT.26 The SBT was originally designed as a stratified
care tool and only included clinically modifiable items, which may
mean that important non-modifiable prognostic indicators were
not included. The performance of a stratified care tool is best
evaluated by an effect size obtained from a randomised, controlled
trial; hence, caution is required if using the SBT for the sole purpose
of predicting prognosis.31
Strengths of this study included: a low follow-up attrition rate;
data collected on a diverse range of psychological measures,
including three measures not previously investigated in relation to
the SBT (perceived risk of pain persistence, self-efficacy, and
chronic pain acceptance); patient-relevant follow-up measures
that are in line with recommendations for research involving
participants with chronic pain;32 and a 1-year follow-up period,
which makes this one of a few studies that has evaluated the SBT at
a follow-up time point longer than 6 months.
There were a number of study limitations. Participants were self-
selecting volunteers predominantly from the general community,
which may have limited the generalisability of the results to specific
clinical or healthcare-seeking populations. However, 213 of 260 (82%)
participants received some form of intervention between baseline and
1-year follow-up, suggesting that this cohort was largely care-seeking
and therefore broadly representative of patients with chronic LBP
seeking care in a primary care setting. Participants had dominant axial
LBP so the results may not be relevant to people with dominant low-
back-related leg pain. The participants lost to follow-up had higher
baseline disability and risk status, which may have biased the results.
The follow-up measures were dichotomised, which facilitates reader
understanding but may have resulted in a loss of information. Using
different operational definitions for recovery could have influenced
the results. Participants were free to pursue treatment throughout the
study period. Robust data on treatment type and efficacy were not
collected;26hence,it isunknownwhatinfluence,if any,treatmentmay
have had on recovery or the SBT’s performance. Nonetheless, the SBT
was designed to guide decision-making7regardless of what treatment
thepatientmayormaynothaveinthefuture.Finally,thisstudydidnot
provide any information on the clinical or economic benefits of
stratified care. However, if the SBT has relatively weak prognostic
ability, its usefulness to stratify care may be limited in people with
chronic LBP.33
This study provides valuable information for clinicians on the
usefulness and limitations of the SBT for patients with chronic LBP.
The SBT has value as a substitute for the administration of multiple
full-length, unidimensional questionnaires to initially screen for
high levels of pain, disability, and negative psychological affect and
cognitions. The practicality of the SBT is derived from its
multidimensional nature, and low responder and assessor burden
facilitating its use in busy clinical practice. Although the SBT had
moderate predictive and acceptable discriminative ability for
disability 1 year later, clinicians need to be aware that patient-
relevant outcomes extend beyond self-reported disability. The SBT
appears limited in its ability to predict all aspects of a patient’s
outcome. The SBT should be used alongside the clinical examina-
tion and in conjunction with sound clinical reasoning when
making care decisions.34
What is already known about this topic: The SBT was
designed to stratify patients with non-specific LBP into low risk,
medium risk, and high risk of poor disability outcome, with a
matched care pathway for each subgroup. The predictive and
discriminative ability of the SBT in populations with LBP of
variable episode duration is supported in the literature, partic-
ularly for future disability among primary care populations. To
date, there have been no large studies that have investigated

 the SBT’s predictive and discriminative ability in a population
exclusively with chronic LBP.
What this study adds: This study adds to the literature on
SBT’s generalisability across populations. In a cohort with
chronic non-specific LBP, those with higher SBT risk categor-
isation had significantly greater pain intensity, greater disabil-
ity, higher scores on negative psychological constructs, and
lower scores on positive psychological constructs at baseline.
While the SBT provided an acceptable indication of future
disability in this population, it performed poorly with respect to
pain and global perceived change at the 1-year follow-up.
Reliance on the SBT as the sole indicator of prognosis in
chronic LBP is not recommended.
