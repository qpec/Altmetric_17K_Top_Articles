Tobacco Product Use Among Lesbian, 
Gay, and Bisexual Adolescents
Hongying Dai, PhD
abstract
OBJECTIVES: Sexual minority youth face health disparities and a high risk of substance abuse. 
This study sought to fully characterize the disparity of tobacco use and risk factors in this 
high-risk subpopulation.
METHODS: Using data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the current use of various 
tobacco products (cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, and e-cigarettes) was compared 
according to sex and distinct sexual identities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and unsure). 
Heterosexual/straight adolescents served as the control group.
RESULTS: Of 14 703 respondents, 88.8% were heterosexual/straight, 2.0% were lesbian 
or gay, 6.0% were bisexual, and 3.2% were unsure about their sexual identity. Sexual 
minorities had a higher prevalence of tobacco product use than their heterosexual/straight 
counterparts. Sex had a significant effect on the disparities of tobacco use. Lesbian and 
bisexual girls had higher odds of reporting current use of any tobacco product, cigarettes, 
cigars, and e-cigarettes than did straight girls, whereas sexual minority boys had similar 
smoking behaviors compared with straight boys. Substance use, including marijuana use, 
drinking, and binge drinking, was significantly associated with any tobacco use.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco use differs among subgroups of sexual minority youth, with lesbians 
and bisexual girls having a higher prevalence of tobacco use than their straight peers. 
Heterogeneity of tobacco use across distinct sexual identity groups underscores the need to 
develop evidence-based tobacco control strategies for sexual minority youth.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Adult studies 
have shown that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgender minorities face health disparities 
compared with their nonminority counterparts. Few 
nationally representative surveys have provided 
information on cigarette and other tobacco product 
use among sexual minority adolescents.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Sexual minority youth, 
especially lesbians and bisexual girls, had a higher 
prevalence of tobacco use than their straight peers. 
For sexual minorities, high prevalence of tobacco 
use might start in youth, and the risk behaviors 
continue to develop into adulthood.

DAI 
Evidence suggests that sexual 
minority adults, including lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
individuals, smoke at substantially 
higher rates than their nonminority 
counterparts. 
1 
 
– 
4 In addition to 
cigarette smoking, sexual minority 
adults also use other tobacco 
products such as hookah, cigars, and 
e-cigarettes at a higher prevalence 
than straight populations.2, 
 
5 
Furthermore, disparities have been 
identified among these distinct 
groups, with sexual minority women 
and bisexual adults having the highest 
risk of smoking. 
2, 
 
3, 
 
6 The disparities 
in tobacco use are driven by certain 
factors, including stress due to social 
stigma and discrimination, 
7, 
 
8 and are 
further exacerbated by aggressive 
marketing from the tobacco industry 
and limited access to effective tobacco 
treatment. 
7, 
 
9 
–11 It is important to 
identify smoking patterns and social 
correlates at an early stage of life 
for this priority population because 
risky health behaviors are often 
established during adolescence, with 
9 of 10 smokers having tried their 
first cigarette by age 18 years. 
12 
Several studies have shown that LGBT 
youth or young adults had a higher 
prevalence of cigarette smoking 
than straight adolescents. 
3, 
 
13 
– 
16 For 
example, Austin et al 
13 found that the 
odds of smoking among lesbian and 
bisexual youth were 5.3 times higher 
than for their straight counterparts. 
In a Canadian study, Azagba et al 
16 
reported that LGB adolescents 
were 50% to 168% more likely to 
smoke daily compared with non-
LGB adolescents. These studies have 
provided evidence for researchers to 
advocate recognizing sexual minority 
communities as a priority population 
for tobacco prevention and cessation 
services.
Despite progress in addressing health 
disparities among sexual minorities, 
the data collection on sexual minority 
groups from national population–
based samples has been limited, 
 
17, 
 
18 
especially for adolescents. Most 
national surveys addressing 
tobacco use in youth do not collect 
information on sexual orientation, 
whereas localized studies, often 
with small sample sizes and regional 
differences, can yield results that 
might not be representative of the 
nation at large. 
4 At the same time, 
treating adolescent LGB as a unified 
population, as some current studies 
have done, might provide inaccurate 
measurements of LGB tobacco use. 
A few adult studies have parsed the 
LGB category to assess smoking 
prevalence according to distinct 
sexual identities, 
 
2, 
6, 
 
13 and they have 
found that female sexual minority 
adults are at higher risk of smoking 
than their male counterparts. 
However, little is known about how 
patterns of tobacco use differ among 
distinct groups of LGB adolescents at 
the national level. In addition, limited 
studies have examined LGB tobacco 
use beyond cigarette smoking. 
Johnson et al 
2 reported a higher 
prevalence of hookah and e-cigarette 
use among LGB adults than among 
straight populations. Rath et al 
19 
reported high rates of ever-use of 
other tobacco products (ie, cigars, 
little cigars, e-cigarettes, dissolvable 
tobacco products, hookah) among 
LGB young adults (18–34 years of 
age) than among non-LGB young 
adults. However, few national 
studies have explored the use 
of alternative tobacco products 
according to sexual identity among 
adolescents. Such knowledge 
is critical because cigarette use 
among youth has declined in 
recent years, and the decrease in 
cigarette smoking attained over the 
last several decades is now offset 
by the increasing popularity of 
alternative tobacco products such 
as e-cigarettes. 
20 
– 
23 Furthermore, 
the association between youth 
cigarette smoking and other 
substance use, such as marijuana 
use and drinking, 
 
19, 
 
24, 
25 needs to be 
evaluated specifically among sexual 
minority youth.
To address the gaps in knowledge, 
the present study examined the 
differences in use of various tobacco 
products according to sex and 
sexual identity by using a nationally 
representative sample from the 2015 
Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). 
This analysis specifically sought 
to: (1) assess the prevalence of use 
of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco 
(including chewing tobacco, snuff, 
and dip), cigars (including cigars, 
cigarillos, and little cigars), and 
e-cigarettes according to sex and 
distinct sexual identity groups; and 
(2) examine factors associated with 
tobacco use within distinct groups of 
sexual minorities.
METHODS
Data
The data were collected from 
the 2015 YRBS, a national study 
conducted biennially in odd-
numbered years since 1991. The 
surveys collect a wide range of 
priority health-risk behaviors among 
a nationally representative sample 
of US students in grades 9 through 
12. The national YRBS uses a 3-stage, 
cluster sample design; a detailed 
description of the YRBS survey 
design and data collection can be 
found on the YRBS Web site. 
26, 
 
27 
YRBS protected student privacy by 
allowing for anonymous participation 
and by following local parental 
permission procedures. Students 
completed a self-administered 
questionnaire during 1 class period 
with no physical test or examination 
involved. 
28 The 2015 national YRBS 
had a school response rate of 69% 
and a student response rate of 80%; 
the overall response rate was 60%. 
The study included a total of 15 624 
respondents.
Measures
Sexual Minority Populations
The YRBS includes questions 
measuring 2 elements of sexual 
orientation: sexual identity and sex

of sexual contacts. Because there was 
discordance between sexual identity 
and sex of sexual contacts, 
 
18 and the 
sexual identity question yielded a 
larger sample size compared with 
the question of sex of sexual 
contacts, 
 
29 the sexual identity 
question was used in this study to 
identify sexual minority youth.
Sexual identity was ascertained by 
using the following item from the 
2015 YRBS: “Which of the following 
best describe you?” The response 
options included “Heterosexual 
(straight), 
” “Gay or lesbian, 
” “Bisexual, 
” 
and “Not sure.” A total of 921 
students were excluded who did not 
complete this question, resulting in 
14 703 respondents in the final study.
Tobacco Use
Current tobacco use was assessed 
by using the following 4 questions: 
“During the past 30 days, on 
how many days did you smoke 
cigarettes?”; “During the past 30 
days, on how many days did you 
use chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip, 
such as Red Man, Levi Garrett, 
Beech-Nut, Skoal, Skoal Bandits, or 
Copenhagen?”; “During the past 30 
days, on how many days did you 
smoke cigars, cigarillos, or little 
cigars?”; and “During the past 30 
days, on how many days did you 
use an electronic vapor product?” 
Response options included “0 days, 
” 
“1 or 2 days, 
” “3 to 5 days, 
” “6 to 9 
days, 
” “10 to 19 days, 
” “20 to 29 days, 
” 
and “all 30 days.” Students who 
responded >0 days were classified 
as current cigarette users, current 
smokeless tobacco users, current 
cigar users, or current e-cigarette 
users, respectively. Students who 
reported using any of these 4 
categories of tobacco products in 
the past 30 days were classified as 
current any tobacco users.
Covariates
To control for other influences, 
several covariates were included 
in the analysis, including sex (male 
or female), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, 
Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other), 
age (<15 or ≥15 years), and grade 
(grades 9–10 and 11–12). Current 
marijuana users were responders 
who answered “≥1 time” to the 
question “During the past 30 
days, how many times did you use 
marijuana?” Current drinking status 
was defined if responders answered 
“≥1 day” to the question “During 
the past 30 days, on how many days 
did you have at least one drink of 
alcohol?” Current binge drinking 
status was defined if responders 
answered “≥1 day” to the question 
“During the past 30 days, on how 
many days did you have 5 or more 
drinks of alcohol in a row, that is, 
within a couple of hours?”
Statistical Methods
Summary statistics of demographic 
characteristics and substance use 
according to sexual identity were 
reported and compared by using 
the Rao-Scott χ2 test. Sampling 
weights and survey stratum 
were included in all analyses to 
account for the complex survey 
design. Weighted prevalence 
estimates of current use of tobacco 
products, including any tobacco, 
cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, 
cigars, and e-cigarettes, were 
estimated according to sex and 
sexual identity. Logistic regression 
models were performed to compare 
risks of tobacco use according to 
sex and sexual identity and were 
adjusted for race, age, and grade in 
the multivariate analysis. Finally, 
separate regression analyses were 
performed among heterosexual, 
gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure 
groups to assess the associations 
between sex, race, age, other 
substance use, and current use of 
any tobacco products. Statistical 
analyses were performed by using 
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC), and a P value <.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Among the 14 703 respondents in 
the analysis, 12 954 (88.8%) were 
heterosexual/straight, 324 (2.0%) 
were gay/lesbian, 922 (6.0%) were 
bisexual, and 503 (3.2%) were not 
sure about their sexual identity. 
The distribution of demographic 
characteristics and other substance 
use according to sexual identity is 
listed in  
Table 1. Bisexual adolescents 
were much more likely to be 
female than male (79.6% vs 20.4%) 
compared with other groups. The 
distribution of sexual identity varied 
according to race (P = .001), with 
non-Hispanic black adolescents 
having a relatively higher proportion 
of gay/lesbian subjects. Gay/lesbian 
(33.1%) and bisexual (31.7%) 
adolescents had a higher prevalence 
of marijuana use than their straight 
(20.7%) and unsure (26.0%) peers. 
Bisexual adolescents had the highest 
prevalence of drinking (41.8%) 
among distinct sexual identity 
groups.
 
Table 2 presents the prevalence 
of current use of various tobacco 
products according to sex and sexual 
identity. Overall, sexual minority 
adolescents had a higher prevalence 
of reporting tobacco use than did 
their straight counterparts. About 
40.5% of gay/lesbian and 38.5% of 
bisexual adolescents reporting use 
of any tobacco product in the last 
30 days compared with 29.6% of 
heterosexual/straight students and 
32.2% of unsure adolescents (P < 
.0001). Gay/lesbian adolescents and 
unsure adolescents had a higher 
prevalence of reporting use of all 4 
tobacco products than did straight 
students. Bisexual adolescents had a 
higher prevalence of reporting use of 
cigarettes, cigars, and e-cigarettes but 
a lower prevalence of reporting use 
of smokeless tobacco products than 
did their straight peers.
A strong sex interaction with 
disparities of tobacco use was 
observed across sexual identity

groups. Lesbian and bisexual girls 
had a higher prevalence of reporting 
current use of any tobacco products, 
cigarettes, cigars, and e-cigarettes 
than did straight girls, whereas sexual 
minority boys had similar smoking 
behaviors compared with straight 
boys. For heterosexual/straight and 
unsure adolescents, boys had a higher 
prevalence of reporting use of any 
tobacco and all 4 tobacco products 
than did girls. For gay/lesbians and 
bisexual students, girls had a higher 
prevalence of reporting use of any 
tobacco product, cigarettes, and 
e-cigarettes but a lower prevalence of 
reporting use of smokeless tobacco 
and cigars than did boys.
The risks of use of various tobacco 
products were compared among 
sexual identity groups ( 
Table 3). 
For female adolescents, compared 
with their heterosexual/straight 
counterparts, lesbians had higher 
odds of reporting use of any tobacco 
product (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 
2.3; P = .002), cigarettes (aOR: 2.9; 
P = .004), cigars (aOR: 3.2; P = 
.003), and e-cigarettes (aOR: 1.8; 
P = .045); bisexual adolescents had 
higher odds of reporting use of 
any tobacco product (aOR: 2.2; 
P < .0001), cigarettes (aOR: 3.7; P < 
.0001), cigars (aOR: 2.1; P < .0001), 
and e-cigarettes (aOR: 1.9; P < .0001); 
and unsure adolescents had higher 
odds of reporting use of cigars (aOR: 
1.8; P = .028). For male adolescents, 
gay boys had lower odds of reporting 
use of smokeless tobacco (aOR: 0.1; 
P = .001) and unsure adolescents had 
higher odds of reporting use of cigars 
(aOR: 1.9; P = .044) than did their 
straight counterparts.

Within each sexual identity group, 
factors associated with any tobacco 
use were assessed further ( 
Table 4). 
Boys had higher odds of reporting 
use of any tobacco product than did 
girls (aOR: 1.6; P < .0001) among 
straight adolescents, but they were 
not significantly different from girls 
among sexual minority groups. 
Non-Hispanic black adolescents 
had lower odds of reporting use of 
any tobacco product than did non-
Hispanic white adolescents (aOR: 
0.6; P < .0001) among straight youth, 
but they were not significantly 
different from each other among 
sexual minorities. Use of marijuana, 
drinking, and binge drinking 
increased the odds of any tobacco 
use among all groups. However, 
the effects were different among 
straight adolescents and distinct 
sexual minority groups. For example, 
binge drinking (compared with no 
drinking) increased the odds of any 
tobacco use by nearly 13 times 
(aOR: 13.6; P < .0001) for gay/
lesbian youth, but the effect 
dropped by more than one-half 
for bisexual adolescents (aOR: 5.6; 
P < .0001).
DISCUSSIONS
The health outcomes of sexual 
minorities are understudied. The 
Institute of Medicine called for 
population-based studies to better 
understand LGBT health. 
30 The 
present study used the first wave 
of the nationally representative 
sample from YRBS to assess the 
use of various tobacco products 
according to sex and distinct 
sexual identity. The findings 
confirm the disparities of cigarette 
smoking among sexual minority 
youth and further extend our 
understanding of these disparities 
to alternative tobacco products. 
A growing body of literature has 
examined the association between 
sexual orientation and smoking 
cigarettes.

DAI 
study examined differences in use 
of various tobacco products among 
sexual minority youth. Overall, 
lesbian/gay adolescents had the 
highest rate of current use of any 
tobacco product (40.5%), followed 
by bisexual adolescents (38.5%) 
and unsure adolescents (32.2%) 
compared with their straight peers 
(29.6%). The association between 
sexual orientation and tobacco 
use could be due to social stigma, 
social isolation, family rejection, 
discrimination, and emotional 
abuse.13 Because sexual minority 
youth face a wide range of health 
disparities, the findings in this study 
could provide evidence for public 
health agencies and health care 
organizations to formulate culturally 
competent tobacco prevention 
programs and interventions targeting 
LGBT youth. For instance, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
“Tips from Former Smokers” 
campaign featured real stories 
from LGBT individuals to advocate 
smoking cessation among the sexual 
minority community. 
35 The American 
Lung Association has called on 
governmental agencies, health care 
systems, LGBT health advocates, 
and community members to develop 
a combination of policy change, 
prevention messaging campaigns, 
and tobacco cessation services for 
this vulnerable population. 
4
As cigarette use among youth has 
declined in recent years, the tobacco 
industry has been promoting 
alternative tobacco products to 
entice a new generation of young 
users. The present study found 
that sexual minority youth have 
complex patterns of various tobacco 
use and higher risks of alternative 
tobacco use than their straight 
peers. E-cigarettes, in particular, are 
gaining popularity among youth. 
21 
To the best of my knowledge, the 
present study is the first national 
trial to report a higher prevalence 
of current use of e-cigarettes among 
lesbian (30.7%) and bisexual (30.0%) 
adolescents compared with straight 
adolescents (23.4%). Because the 
use of e-cigarettes has outpaced the 
use of traditional cigarettes among 
teenagers, 
 
20 
 
–23 these findings have 
implications in future e-cigarette 
research to better understand the 
initiation and frequency of e-cigarette 
use among sexual minority youth.
Previous studies of sexual minority 
adults have identified tobacco use 
disparities according to sex and 
sexual identity and found that 
sexual minority women, especially 
bisexual women, had the highest 
smoking prevalence compared with 
other groups. 
2, 
 
6 The present study 
assessed tobacco use according 
to sex and sexual identity among 
adolescents and similarly found 
that both lesbian and bisexual girls 
had higher odds of reporting the 
current use of any tobacco product, 
cigarettes, cigars, and e-cigarettes 
than did straight girls. In contrast, 
sexual minority boys were far 
more similar in smoking behaviors 
compared with straight boys. These 
findings, taken together with those 
of previous studies, suggest that 
a high prevalence of tobacco use 
starts at an early age among sexual 
minority girls, and the risk behaviors 
continue to develop into adulthood. 
The heterogeneity in tobacco use 
according to sex and sexual identity 
underscores the need to identify 
risk factors that are associated 
with the disparities of tobacco use 
among sexual minorities intragroup 
(lesbian/gay vs bisexual versus 
unsure) and consider between-sex 
differences in future studies of LGBT 
youth.
By analyzing factors associated with 
any tobacco use within each sexual 
identity group, substance use was 
found to be significantly associated 
with any tobacco use among all 4 
sexual identity groups. Disparities in 
associations were reported between 
drinking, binge drinking, and any 
tobacco use among sexual minorities 
and their straight peers. For example, 
binge drinking increased the risk of 
any tobacco use >2 times higher for 
gay/lesbian youth than for bisexual 
youth. These findings again suggest 
the heterogeneity of factors associated 
with tobacco use among straight 
adolescents and distinct sexual 
minority groups. A one-size-fits-all 
approach might not work for sexual 
minority youth, and evidence-based 
strategy and tailored inventions are 
needed to counter the high risk of 
substance use among this population. 
Parents, health practitioners, and 
school educators should be aware 
of these risk factors associated with 
tobacco use among sexual minority 
youth and educate them about the 
danger of tobacco use.
These findings are subject to several 
limitations. First, the 2015 YRBS 
data are cross-sectional; thus, causal 
inferences could not be established. 
Second, because sexual identity was 
used as the measurement, and the 
study was not designed to identify 
transgender adolescents, the data are 
not inclusive of all LGBT adolescents. 
The inclusion of gender measures on 
national surveys has been limited, 
and enhancements for measurement 
methods for identifying transgender 
adolescents are critically needed. 
Third, the YRBS data are school-
based surveys of representative 
samples of ninth- through 12th-grade 
students. Excluding high school 
dropouts, home-schooled students, 
and other youth not in school might 
lead to a sampling bias, which could 
be more pronounced for sexual 
minority youth because they are 
more likely to drop out of school and 
have poorer school attendance than 
their straight peers. Future research 
is needed to further evaluate tobacco 
use among sexual minority youth 
who are not represented in a school-
based survey. Finally, some estimates 
of the prevalence of tobacco use also 
had wide confidence intervals due to 
the small sample size, and thus these 
estimates should be interpreted with 
appropriate caution.

CONCLUSIONS
Despite these aforementioned 
limitations, this population study 
examined differences in use of 
various tobacco products across 
LGB sexual minority youth and 
assessed the factors associated 
with tobacco use according to sex 
and sexual identity. Heterogeneity 
in use of various tobacco products 
was identified according to sex 
and sexual identity. Lesbians and 
bisexual adolescents had higher 
odds of using cigarettes, cigars, and 
e-cigarettes than their nonsexual 
minority counterparts. These 
findings underscore the need to 
develop evidence-based tobacco 
control policies for sexual minority 
youth that consider the heterogeneity 
within the sexual minority 
population.
