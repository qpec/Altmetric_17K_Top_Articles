BACKGROUND: Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. 
Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, 
≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of 
restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation 
by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander 
automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional 
outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.
METHODS: From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium 
prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 
9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a 
bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with 
initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome 
measure was discharge with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional 
status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital 
discharge was the secondary outcome measure.
RESULTS: Among 49 
555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs 
were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander 
shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by 
a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to discharge (66.5% 
versus 43.0%) and be discharged with favorable functional outcome 
(57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency 
medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the 
odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence 
interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital discharge and 2.73 (95% 
confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for discharge with favorable functional 
outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as 
emergency medical services response time became longer.
CONCLUSIONS: Bystander automated external defibrillator use before 
emergency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA 
was associated with better survival and functional outcomes. Continued 
emphasis on public automated external defibrillator utilization programs 
may further improve outcomes of OHCA.

O
ut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains 
a significant cause of mortality and morbid-
ity throughout the world,1 and sudden cardiac 
death is often the first symptom of underlying car-
diopulmonary pathology.2–4 Overall survival following 
OHCA is low.1,5 The presenting arrest rhythm has a 
strong influence on prognosis. Cardiac arrest present-
ing with an initial rhythm of ventricular tachycardia and 
ventricular fibrillation has significantly better odds of 
survival in comparison with nonshockable rhythms, in 
particular, when early cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
and rapid defibrillation are available.6–8 Although the 
overall prevalence of shockable rhythms in OHCA has 
decreased over the past 30 years,9,10 the prevalence of 
such rhythms in observed OHCA occurring in public 
rather than at home has been reported to be as high 
as 60%.6,11 The high proportion of shockable rhythms 
in public OHCA suggests that automatic external defi-
brillators (AEDs) located in public locations, which can 
be used by bystanders to decrease the time to defi-
brillation, may be a particularly effective allocation of 
resources. Given the potential for extremely rapid de-
fibrillation before emergency medical services (EMS) 
arrival, the ≈18 
200 individuals (annually in the United 
States alone) who experience shockable observed pub-
lic OHCA (SOP-OHCA) represent an ideal population in 
which public access defibrillation can improve survival.
Indeed, the use of public access defibrillators is con-
sistently shown to improve survival in overall shockable 
OHCA.12,13 This benefit has been attributed to the de-
creased time to defibrillation for bystander versus EMS 
shock, because survival in shockable OHCA decreases 
significantly with each minute of delay in defibrilla-
tion.14–16 These studies, however, did not report the 
detailed functional status of the patients at discharge 
or determine how EMS response might influence the 
effectiveness of bystander AED use. Recently, 3 key 
studies have reported on functional outcomes follow-
ing bystander AED use. Malta Hansen and colleagues17 
evaluated functional outcome from bystander versus 
EMS shock for a subset of counties in North Carolina 
where EMS response was on average >8 minutes. Kita-
mura and colleagues18 analyzed functional outcomes 
associated with bystander AED use in Japan in a setting 
with longer EMS response. Kragholm et al19 reported 
that bystander interventions were associated with im-
proved 1-year neurological function among 30-day sur-
vivors of OHCA. These studies suggested that bystander 
AED use was associated with improved functional out-
come, although the definition of improved functional 
outcome has varied considerably between studies.
The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) is a 
collaboration among several large sites with rigorous 
data collection processes on multiple components of 
pre- and posthospital care that presents a unique op-
portunity to study bystander intervention in the setting 
of strictly monitored and often rapid EMS response 
times. This multicenter, international, observational 
cohort study compared survival and a strictly defined 
favorable functional outcome between patients treat-
ed with initial bystander AED shock versus initial EMS 
shock among SOP-OHCAs from 2011 to 2015.
METHODS
The data and analytical methods are available to other research-
ers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the pro-
cedure. The data set is available at the National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute bioLINCC (Biologic Specimen and Data Repository 
Information Coordinating Center) program,20 and the analysis 
software is available as an online-only Data Supplement.
Study Design and Setting
The ROC is a clinical trials network implemented to investi-
gate strategies to improve outcomes in prehospital cardiopul-
monary resuscitation and severe traumatic injury. This study is 
a prospectively designed analysis using the ROC Epistry data 
set that aims to ascertain all treated OHCAs for each ROC site. 
The ROC Epistry defines an OHCA as a case in which cardio-
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed by EMS or defi-
brillation was attempted by EMS or a bystander. The current 
investigation used data from cases treated in 6 US regions 
(Seattle/King County, WA; Dallas/Fort Worth, TX; Pittsburgh, 
PA; Milwaukee, WI; Birmingham, AL; Portland, OR) and 3 
Canadian regions (Toronto, ON; Ottawa, ON; Vancouver, 
British Columbia).
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Bystander automated external defibrillation versus 
emergency medical services defibrillation in shock-
able observed public out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
is associated with an increased odds of survival 
with full or nearly full functional recovery.
• The benefit of bystander automated external defi-
brillation use increases as the arrival of emergency 
medical services is delayed.
• Overall bystanders shocked a remarkable 19% of 
shockable observed public out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrests from 2011 to 2015 at 9 sites across the 
United States and Canada.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Efforts to increase the availability and use of auto-
mated external defibrillators in public locations 
are likely the most promising immediate ways to 
improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
• The effective allocation of automated external 
defibrillators and training may benefit from an 
emphasis on locations where the response time for 
emergency medical response is longer.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
Approval for the ROC Epistry and associated investigations 
was provided by the institutional review boards or research 
ethics boards at each ROC site. All research was conducted 
in accordance with US and Canadian regulations on human 
subjects research.
Inclusion Criteria
This study included all patients at least 18 years of age 
with nontraumatic SOP-OHCA on whom defibrillation was 
attempted by EMS or a bystander. Although not a part of the 
primary study population, additional analyses among patients 
with unobserved and private OHCA was also performed to 
expand on the generalizability of the findings. Patients who 
attained return of spontaneous circulation before EMS arrival 
as a result of bystander AED use were included. The study 
excluded (1) patients on whom CPR was not attempted as a 
result of do-not-resuscitate orders or clear signs of death; (2) 
EMS-observed cardiac arrests because bystander AED is not 
relevant in these cases; and (3) the modest number (n=18) for 
whom no EMS shock was delivered, but subsequent analysis 
of ECG records indicated an initial shockable rhythm.
Data Collection and Definitions
A detailed description of data collection, quality control, 
and definitions has been reported previously.21 In brief, data 
elements from each OHCA were collected by trained study 
personnel according to a set of predefined and uniform data 
collection procedures designed to maximize the validity, 
reproducibility, and accuracy of data. Data collection proce-
dures and data definitions were implemented by the study 
investigators according to the Utstein standards. Canadian 
sites are not permitted to assess the race of the patient; these 
individuals are treated as having an unknown race. Random 
and centralized audits of data collection practices were con-
ducted throughout the study period to ensure the stability 
and reproducibility of data acquisition. Functional outcomes 
were assessed from the patient health record by trained study 
personnel.
The primary comparison groups and outcome measures 
for the current study were identified prospectively, and indi-
viduals involved in patient care were not aware of the study 
intent. A public location was defined as a street or highway, 
public building, place of recreation, industrial place, or other 
public property, excluding healthcare facilities (hospitals, med-
ical clinics, and other healthcare institutions). All other loca-
tions, excluding healthcare facilities as above, were defined 
as private. Bystander-observed cardiac arrest was defined as 
an arrest that was observed by a person who was not a mem-
ber of the organized EMS response. Police officers were con-
sidered bystanders. A shockable rhythm was defined as any 
patient in whom an AED shock was delivered, an AED rhythm 
analysis (when available) indicated a shockable rhythm, or the 
initial EMS ECG readings indicated a shockable rhythm. All 
other arrests were considered nonshockable. The incidence 
of incorrect ECG analysis by an AED is rare.22 A previous 
study reported the error rate in the ECG rhythm assignment 
by EMS providers for a portion of this data set was 3.1%.11 
Bystander AED shock was defined as any shock delivered by 
a bystander-applied AED before EMS arrival as reported by 
the bystander to EMS personnel or when AED records were 
available and indicated a shock was delivered. EMS shock was 
defined as any cardiac arrest in which the initial shock was 
delivered by EMS. Individuals shocked by a bystander-applied 
AED who were later shocked by EMS were still considered 
bystander-shocked. EMS response interval was defined as the 
time period from receipt of the initial 911 call at the dispatch 
center to the arrival of the EMS vehicle at the scene.
Functional Outcome
Functional outcomes were assessed from the medical record 
by trained ROC personnel using the modified Rankin Score 
(mRS), a validated, clinician-reported measure of global dis-
ability.23,24 The mRS uses a scoring system from 0 to 6 to quan-
tify functional outcome (0=no symptoms; 1=no significant 
disability; 2=slight disability; 3=moderate disability, requiring 
some help but able to walk without assistance; 4=moderately 
severe disability, unable to walk or attend to bodily needs 
without assistance; 5=severe disability; 6=death). An mRS≤2 
is a validated dichotomous indicator of favorable functional 
outcome and was selected a priori as the primary functional 
outcome.23 Although we chose to identify patients with mini-
mal disability (mRS≤2) as the cutoff for favorable outcome, 
because of a lack of consensus in the cardiac arrest literature 
for cutoff mRS, we included a sensitivity analysis using the 
less strict ≤3 cutoff. mRS=3 indicates an inability to look after 
one’s own affairs without assistance.23,24
Statistical Analysis 
Subjects’ characteristics and treatment were summarized with 
proportions, mean and SD, or median and interquartile range 
as appropriate. The attempt of this study was to analyze the 
impact of bystander AED use while limiting the impact of con-
founding from patient characteristics, other bystander inter-
ventions, and prehospital treatment. Therefore, in the primary 
analysis, multivariable logistic regression was used to quan-
tify the relationship between bystander AED shock and good 
functional outcome, adjusted for age, sex, race, bystander 
CPR, EMS response time, and study site.
A similar analysis was conducted for the secondary out-
come measure of survival to hospital discharge. Results are 
expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
We undertook a sensitivity analysis that excluded cases from 
the bystander AED shock group who were treated by police 
(n=41). In a secondary analysis, we also evaluated whether 
the potential outcome benefit of bystander AED shock was 
modified by the EMS response interval by including an inter-
action term between bystander AED shock and EMS response 
interval. All statistical analyses were performed with commer-
cially available statistical packages (SAS, version 9.4; R, ver-
sion 2.14.1).

observed public cardiac arrests presented with an 
initial shockable rhythm. A total of 89 SOP-OHCAs 
were excluded for do-not-resuscitate orders, sub-
jects dead on EMS arrival, missing data, or confirmed 
shockable rhythms that were not shocked by EMS or 
a bystander. Consequently, the primary study cohort 
of SOP-OHCAs included the 469 who were shocked 
by a bystander and 2031 who were initially shocked 
by EMS (Figure 1).
The bystander- and EMS-shocked patients in the 
SOP-OHCA group were similar according to the Utstein 
data elements with the exception of bystander CPR and 
administration of epinephrine (Table 1). Bystander CPR 
was initiated more often among bystander-shocked 
OHCAs, whereas epinephrine was administered more 
often in the EMS-shocked group. Much of the observed 
difference in epinephrine administration between EMS- 
and bystander-shocked patients is explained by the

30.9% of bystander-shocked patients achieving return 
of spontaneous circulation before EMS arrival, because 
no patient with return of spontaneous circulation on 
EMS arrival received epinephrine.
Bystander-Applied Shock 
Over the entire study period, bystanders initiated CPR 
in 73% of SOP-OHCAs (Table 1). Bystanders applied an 
AED and delivered a shock before the arrival of EMS 
personnel in 18.8% of SOP-OHCAs.
Survival and Functional Outcomes 
Functionally favorable survival (mRS≤2) was greater 
among those patients treated with bystander AED 
shock than EMS shock (57.1% versus 32.7%, P<0.001) 
with most of the outcome advantage apparent when 
comparing the group with no disability (mRS=0 for 
32.6% of AED bystander-shocked versus 14.4% of 
EMS-shocked, P<0.001) (Table 2). After multivariable 
adjustment, the odds ratio for discharge with favorable 
functional outcome (mRS≤2) associated with initial by-
stander shock was 2.73 (95% CI, 2.17–3.44, P<0.001) 
(Table 3). The relationships between bystander AED 
use and favorable outcome were similar regardless of 
the mRS cutoff (mRS≤3 or mRS≤2). Overall survival to 
hospital discharge was 66.5% among AED bystander-
shocked versus 43.0% among EMS-shocked, P<0.001. 
After adjustment, the odds ratio for survival to dis-
charge associated with initial AED bystander shock was 
2.62 (95% CI, 2.07–3.31) (Table 3). No survival benefit 
of bystander shock in comparison with EMS shock was 
seen in subjects with shockable public arrest that was 
not observed by the bystander. In shockable arrests oc-
curring in private locations, there was a significant sur-
vival benefit when these arrests were observed by the 
bystander but not in unobserved arrests (Table 3, Tables 
I and II in the online-only Data Supplement).
The overall survival and functional status of individu-
als experiencing SOP-OHCA varied with the location 
of arrest, and the benefit of bystander AED use versus 
EMS defibrillation was strongest at industrial locations 
and places of recreation (Table 4).
The results for favorable functional outcome and sur-
vival to discharge were similar when analyses excluded 
police AED shock from the bystander shock group (ad-
justed odds ratio, 3.02 [95% CI, 2.37–3.78] for favor-
able functional survival; adjusted odds ratio, 2.93 [95% 
CI, 2.29–3.78] for survival to discharge).
EMS Response Time and Survival 
Following Bystander Shock
We observed that the relative benefit of bystander 
AED shock was a function of EMS response interval, 
because the fit of the multivariable logistic model was 
improved with the addition of an interaction term be-
tween EMS response interval and bystander AED shock 
status (P=0.013 for interaction term). As the EMS re-
sponse interval increased, survival with favorable func-
tional outcome declined more rapidly for EMS-shocked 
individuals than for bystander-shocked individuals (Fig-
ure 2). For example, according to this multivariable lo-
gistic model, the adjusted odds ratio for favorable func-
tional outcome associated with bystander AED shock in 
comparison with EMS initial shock was 1.86 (95% CI, 
1.03–3.37) when EMS response interval was 4 minutes, 
3.49 (95% CI, 1.59–7.67) when EMS response was 8 
minutes, and 6.54 (95% CI, 2.15–19.91) when EMS 
response was 12 minutes.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective contemporary observational cohort 
study, we found that bystanders provided the initial 
shock in nearly one fifth of SOP-OHCAs among ROC 
sites. We observed that survival and functionally fa-
vorable outcomes were significantly higher when a 
bystander rather than EMS provided the initial shock. 
Finally, the relative and absolute survival benefit related 
to bystander AED shock increased as the EMS response 
interval became longer. These findings confirm the im-
portant role of bystander-provided defibrillation among 
observed public OHCAs.
In a prior investigation using the ROC Epistry span-
ning the years 2005 to 2007, Weisfeldt and colleagues25 
observed a lower rate of bystander AED shock for all 
public OHCAs in comparison with the current, more 
contemporary experience in public OHCA (7.8% versus 
14.2%; see Table 2, all public arrests). In this previous 
publication, it was estimated that nearly 500 additional 
lives were saved each year in the United States and Can-
ada by bystander AED use. Given the increased use of 
bystander AEDs reported here, we can raise this estimate 
to ≈1700 additional lives saved each year. Furthermore, 
extrapolation of our data suggests that among the 
350 
000 OHCAs treated in the United States each year, 
≈18 
200 are shockable, are observed by a bystander, 
and occur in public locations. According to our results, if 
100% of these individuals were shocked by a bystander, 
≈3459 additional lives would be saved with good neu-
rological outcome. This is in comparison with the 2456 
additional lives that the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration estimates would be saved with univer-
sal seat belt usage.26 It is clear that continued emphasis 
on increasing the number of individuals shocked by a 
bystander is a public health imperative. The temporal in-
crease in the rate of bystander AED use across the ROC 
sites raises the question of which policy and program-
matic interventions may be most  
effective to increase

bystander AED use in public OHCA. There are very likely 
more AEDs available for public use. Analysis of Food and 
Drug Administration reports indicated that the number 
of AEDs sold in the United States increased 10-fold from 
1996 to 2006, from 18 
645 in 1996 to 192 
400 in 2006,27 
and this trend may have continued since. In a study from 
the Netherlands, the increase in early AED shock was at-
tributed to police-dispatched AEDs.28 In North America, 
the role of police AED has been variable, with some but 
not all communities achieving earlier defibrillation and 
better outcomes with such a program.29–31 Only 8.5% 
of the SOP-OHCAs in the current study received a by-
stander AED shock as a consequence of police response. 
A limitation to this result, however, is the fact that we 
are unable to determine whether the police who applied 
the AED were dispatched by the 911 call center versus 
those officers who happened to be on scene at the time 
of cardiac arrest. Regardless, police officers made up a 
limited proportion of AED applications. Furthermore, in 
sensitivity analysis, when police AED use was excluded, 
the adjusted odds ratio of favorable outcome was not 
reduced, indicating that nonpolice bystanders may be as 
effective in AED use as police. A better understanding of 
the temporal increase has implications for communities 
striving to improve their public access AED programs.
The outcome relationships in the current study are 
consistent with prior investigations, including those in-
volving functional outcomes reported from Japan and 
North Carolina.17,18,32,33 Median EMS response in the 
current study is ≈6 minutes, considerably shorter than 
in prior publications and similar to many US and Cana-
dian metropolitan communities.
We did, however, observe an interaction such that 
the benefit of bystander shock depended on the EMS 
response interval. Survival with favorable functional 
outcome in the bystander AED shock group declined

more slowly across EMS response intervals in compari-
son with the group initially shocked by EMS. As a con-
sequence, the greatest relative and absolute survival 
benefits of bystander AED shock occurred among cases 
with a longer EMS response interval. Such information 
may be useful as systems try to allocate placement of 
relatively scarce AED resources.34 The odds of favorable 
neurological outcome did decrease as EMS response 
was delayed for those patients shocked by a bystander, 
possibly indicating that rapid transfer to definitive care 
does improve outcome even with early defibrillation.
It is interesting to note that when the study popu-
lation was expanded to include  shockable observed 
public arrests, there was a significant survival benefit to 
bystander AED shock. Although a prior study showed 
no significant benefit to placing AEDs in the homes of

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
individuals at increased risk for cardiac arrest, many of 
these arrests were unobserved.35 According to our re-
sults, the benefit of bystander shock was not apparent 
when the arrests, either private or public, were unob-
served by the bystander. We propose that the benefit 
of bystander interventions decreases rapidly following 
cardiac arrest; therefore, in cases with unobserved arrest, 
the overall time from onset of arrest to defibrillation is 
longer, potentially reducing the relative time benefit of 
bystander shock. We chose to analyze only public arrests 
in the primary analysis, because this population is unique 
in that a substantial proportion of these arrests is shock-
able and observed in comparison with private arrest, in 
which only ≈10% of arrests are shockable and observed. 
It may be of interest to attempt to identify factors in pri-
vate arrest that increase the likelihood of an arrest being 
observed, such as wearable monitoring devices, because 
this would be a subgroup of private arrests in which by-
stander AED use may be of greatest benefit.
There are several limitations to this study. First, the 
current study is unable to capture functional changes 
that emerge following hospital discharge. A prior study 
has demonstrated that better functional status at dis-
charge is associated with better long-term prognosis.36 
Thus, the current findings suggest that bystander AED 
shock with its excess of mRS 0 and 1 (none and minimal 
disability) in comparison with EMS shock should corre-
spond to favorable long-term prognosis. Furthermore, a 
recent publication reports that among 30-day survivors 
of OHCA, bystander interventions were associated with 
lower 1-year rates of nursing home admission and brain 
injury, indicating that, even after discharge, bystander 
inventions only further improve long-term outcomes.19
The study was observational. Although efforts were 
made in design and analysis to account for potential 
confounding, we cannot be certain that the survival ad-
vantage of bystander AED shock is solely attributable to 
this action versus other factors. For example, bystander 
AED shock was more likely to receive bystander CPR, so 
we adjusted for this covariate in the analysis. There may 
be unmeasured characteristics or care that could not be 
incorporated into the evaluation.
A strength of this study is its inclusion of multiple 
EMS systems from across North America. Nonethe-
less, the systems are involved in clinical trials, so they 
may be higher performing, a circumstance that could 
limit the generalizability. Moreover, we are not able 
to determine if the quality of EMS care influenced the 
potential survival effects of bystander AED use. The 
current study demonstrates that the majority of pa-
tients who receive a bystander AED shock still require 
EMS resuscitation and that a proportion of these pa-
tients ultimately achieves spontaneous circulation and 
survives intact,37 suggesting that EMS care in these 
cases is likely important for prognosis. Moreover, we 
observed that the relative benefit of bystander AED 
depends on the EMS response interval, suggesting 
that bystander AED use may have even greater benefit 
in communities with slower EMS response. A recently 
reported meta-analysis of public access defibrillation 
in OHCA concluded that, for 21 accepted studies, 
AED application by a lay bystander resulted in 32.0% 
(range, 14%–78%) survival, and AED shock resulted 
in 53.0% (14%–78%) survival.38 These findings are 
comparable to this report with 66.5% survival with 
bystander shock. ROC results are high but not out of 
range of other reports. We contend that the results 
presented here, therefore, are readily generalizable 
and serve as an example of the benefit provided by 
rigorously optimizing the pre- and posthospital sys-
tems as many ROC sites have done.
CONCLUSIONS
In this multisystem cohort study of SOP-OHCA, nearly 
20% received a shock by bystander AED. An initial shock 
by bystander AED in comparison with an initial EMS 
shock was associated with a >2-fold increase in the odds 
of favorable functional survival after adjustment for po-
tential confounders. Furthermore, the relative functional 
outcome advantage of bystander AED use increased as 
the EMS response interval become longer. Collectively, 
these findings provide support for ongoing emphasis on 
strategies to increase public access defibrillation.
