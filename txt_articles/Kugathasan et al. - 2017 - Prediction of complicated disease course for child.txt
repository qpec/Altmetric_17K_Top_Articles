Summary
Background—Stricturing and penetrating complications account for substantial morbidity and 
health-care costs in paediatric and adult onset Crohn’s disease. Validated models to predict risk for 
complications are not available, and the effect of treatment on risk is unknown.
Methods—We did a prospective inception cohort study of paediatric patients with newly 
diagnosed Crohn’s disease at 28 sites in the USA and Canada. Genotypes, antimicrobial 
serologies, ileal gene expression, and ileal, rectal, and faecal microbiota were assessed. A 
competing-risk model for disease complications was derived and validated in independent groups. 
Propensity-score matching tested the effect of anti-tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) therapy 
exposure within 90 days of diagnosis on complication risk.
Findings—Between Nov 1, 2008, and June 30, 2012, we enrolled 913 patients, 78 (9%) of whom 
experienced Crohn’s disease complications. The validated competing-risk model included age, 
race, disease location, and antimicrobial serologies and provided a sensitivity of 66% (95% CI 51–
82) and specificity of 63% (55–71), with a negative predictive value of 95% (94–97). Patients who 
received early anti-TNFα therapy were less likely to have penetrating complications (hazard ratio

than were those who did not receive early anti-TNFα therapy. Ruminococcus was implicated in 
stricturing complications and Veillonella in penetrating complications. Ileal genes controlling 
extracellular matrix production were upregulated at diagnosis, and this gene signature was 
associated with stricturing in the risk model (HR 1·70, 95% CI 1·12–2·57; p=0·0120). When this 
gene signature was included, the model’s specificity improved to 71%.
Interpretation—Our findings support the usefulness of risk stratification of paediatric patients 
with Crohn’s disease at diagnosis, and selection of anti-TNFα therapy.

Introduction
Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterised 
by a relapsing and remitting course. Evidence suggests that host genetics and microbial 
dysbiosis have a fundamental role in pathogenesis1 of Crohn’s disease, and childhood is the 
fastest-growing incident age group.2 Most children present with an inflammatory (non-
penetrating, non-stricturing) phenotype. A subgroup rapidly progress to complicated disease 
behaviours, with stricturing and possible bowel obstruction or internal penetrating fistulas, 
or both, often resulting in intra-abdominal sepsis.3 Previous reports about the natural history 
of Crohn’s disease have shown rates of complicated disease ranging from 48% to 52% 5 
years after diagnosis.4 Factors associated with complicated disease behaviours include age at 
diagnosis, ileal disease location, serological responses to various microbial antigens, and 
possibly cumulative genetic risk.4
Despite substantial progress in understanding of the immune pathogenesis of Crohn’s 
disease, little is known about the precise mechanisms responsible for disease complications.5 
Wound healing triggered by inflammation might lead to tissue repair or fibrosis depending 
on the balance between production and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins.4 In 
Crohn’s disease, stricturing occurs when regeneration and repair fail to restore normal tissue 
architecture, and bowel wall thickening leads to luminal narrowing.6 Internal penetration 
develops as a result of active transmural inflammation of the bowel wall with or without 
distal luminal narrowing. The substantial heterogeneity in disease course suggests a strong 
host biological component, with conditioning affected by environmental and intestinal 
microbial factors.
The impact of available therapies, specifically anti-tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) agents, 
on the natural history of Crohn’s disease remains unclear.7 Discovery of factors contributing 
to disease complications and prediction of the risk of such complications in children 
presenting with non-stricturing and non-penetrating Crohn’s disease is crucial to guide 
therapeutic decisions. In 2008, the Risk Stratification and Identification of Immunogenetic 
and Microbial Markers of Rapid Disease Progression in Children with Crohn’s Disease 
(RISK) study was initiated to characterise prospectively the natural history of newly 
diagnosed Crohn’s disease in children presenting with an uncomplicated disease state. We

 aimed to derive a risk-stratification model based on clinical, host biology, and microbial 
factors defined at diagnosis, and treatments including anti-TNFα therapy.
Methods
Study population and outcome classification
We did an inception cohort study at 28 sites in the USA and Canada. Patients younger than 
18 years old with suspected inflammatory bowel disease were enrolled between Nov 1, 
2008, and June 30, 2012 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00790543; appendix). Patients 
who did not have gut inflammation on endoscopy served as controls for these studies. 
Patients with diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease other than Crohn’s disease were 
excluded, as were those for whom incomplete information on disease location was available, 
those who experienced complications either at or within 90 days of diagnosis, and those who 
did not attend at least one follow-up visit.
The institutional review board at each site reviewed and approved the protocol and informed 
written consent or assent was obtained in all cases from parents or guardians. All patients 
provided appropriate assent. This study was approved by national regulatory authorities and 
by local ethics committees or institutional review boards.
Procedures
Patients were managed according to the dictates of their physicians, not by standardised 
protocols. Samples for microbial and gene expression studies were obtained before patients 
began therapy.
Early anti-TNFα exposure was defined as complication-free initiation of therapy within 90 
days of diagnosis and successful completion of both induction doses (three doses infliximab 
and two doses adalimumab) and at least one maintenance dose. We defined disease 
behaviour and location on the basis of the Montreal classification system.8 Stricturing 
disease (B2) was defined as persistent luminal narrowing with pre-stenotic dilatation as 
shown by small bowel contrast imaging. Internal penetrating disease (B3) was defined as 
intra-abdominal fistulising disease resulting in intra-abdominal or pelvic abscesses or 
fistulas to an adjacent organ (excluding the vagina or perianal region). B1 refers to an 
uncomplicated disease state.
At enrolment, blood sample for DNA and plasma were taken from all patients. Stool 
samples and mucosal biopsies from colonoscopic examinations were collected when 
available. Serological determination of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies 
(pANCA), anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) IgG, ASCA IgA, anti-CBir1, 
and anti-outer membrane protein C precursor (OmpC) was done at Cedars-Sinai Hospital 
(Los Angeles, CA, USA).9 Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 
autoantibodies were measured at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (OH, 
USA).10 NOD2 genotypes (rs2066844, rs2066845, and rs2066847) were extracted from 
previously published data11 or determined with TaqMan (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA) single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays. We used the score 
routine available in PLINK to generate a weighted genetic risk score on the basis of

 Immunochip data11 for 137 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Crohn’s 
disease and inflammatory bowel disease.1
DNA was isolated from ileal and rectal biopsies and stool samples and subjected to 16S 
rRNA amplicon sequencing as previously reported.12 The data were subsequently 
reanalysed with advanced software tools and analysis strategies (appendix). For RNA 
sequencing, biopsies were taken from the ileum, rectum, and other colonic locations. 
However, we present results only for ileal biopsies because both B2 and B3 complications 
mainly occur in the terminal ileum. RNA was isolated from ileal biopsies and global patterns 
of gene expression were determined with RNA sequencing as previously reported 
(appendix).
Statistical analysis
We planned to enrol 1100 patients, anticipating a 9% dropout rate and a 15% complication 
rate during 3 years’ follow-up on the basis of historical cohort data (n=583). This sample 
size was expected to sufficiently power identification of ten risk factors for B2 and B3 
outcomes. The planned cohort was also anticipated to allow prediction of complication risk 
with sufficient precision estimated through split sample validation (projected SD of 3% for 
positive predictive value and 1% for negative predictive value based on 1000 simulated 
data).
Potential risk factor data were missing either by study design or in small fractions of the 
cohort. Study design genotyping, microbial community profiling, and RNA sequencing were 
done in different subsets of the cohort. The subsets with complete data were analysed. 
Serology samples were not analysable in 28 patients, and missing cases were imputed as 
seronegative to be conservative.
We deemed time to complication as the response and analysed the data with a competing-
risk model. Whereas standard Cox proportional hazard regression is concerned with only 
one type of event (event vs no event), in this case the response time was defined by two 
complication outcomes, and three mutually exclusively defined disease behaviour states—
stricturing (B2), penetrating (B3), or no event (B1)—were considered. Therefore, we used a 
competing-risk model to extend the proportional hazards model and estimate complication-
specific hazards.13
Clinical variables tested included age at diagnosis, sex, race, disease location,8 disease 
severity measured by the Paediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI),14 perianal 
disease, height Z-score, weight Z-score, and body-mass index Z-score. Laboratory variables 
measured included NOD2 genotype, the Crohn’s disease genetic risk score, albumin, 
haemoglobin, ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), GM-CSF autoantibody, antimicrobial 
serologies, pANCA, and ileal gene expression. Ileal gene expression data for each 
participant were reduced to principal component 1 (PC1) for the extracellular matrix 
production biological pathway before testing in the model. Variables selected to remain in 
the model included those with p values less than 0·1 for either the stricturing or penetrating 
outcome, or, in the case of isolated ileal location, before evidence linking this factor to 
disease complications.15

 Patients who received anti-TNFα within 90 days of diagnosis and met the criteria for 
medication exposure were included in a propensity score analysis. Early anti-TNFα 
exposure was defined in a per-protocol, rather than intention-to-treat, manner, to assess the 
biological effect in the matched groups. However, only six participants who received anti-
TNFα therapy within 90 days did not meet the per-protocol exposure definition. We 
modelled the propensity of early anti-TNFα exposure by regressing the effects of baseline 
factors affecting anti-TNFα use (age, race, sex, disease location, perianal disease, height Z-
score, weight Z-score, PCDAI score at diagnosis, any deep ulcer on colonoscopy, and 
interaction between age and PCDAI) on early anti-TNFα use. Scores representing the 
propensity of early anti-TNFα exposure were computed and used to match each of the 
patients who received early anti-TNFα with a patient who did not. We used the greedy-
matching algorithm16 with caliper of 0·1 SDs.
The study was reported as per the STROBE statement for observational cohort studies. R 
package cmprsk (version 2.2–2.7) was used in R 3.2.2 for competing-risk modelling. 
Descriptive statistics were computed in SAS (version 9.3).

Results
1813 patients were enrolled in our study (table 1). 402 did not have gut inflammation on 
endoscopy and were controls for microbial and gene expression studies. 204 patients were 
diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and 111 with unspecified inflammatory bowel disease. Of 
the 1096 patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, we excluded 18 for whom incomplete 
information on disease location was available, 42 who experienced complications at 
diagnosis, 17 who experienced complications within 90 days, and 106 who did not attend at 
least one follow-up visit. Thus, 913 patients who were free of complications 90 days after 
diagnosis were included in the final analysis.
Median age at diagnosis was 12·4 years (IQR 10·0–14·7). 565 (62%) participants were male, 
681 (75%) were white, and 121 (13%) were African American or mixed race. Stricturing 
disease was associated with ASCA, CBir1, and GM-CSF seropositivity, and penetrating 
disease was associated with older age, African American race, and ASCA and CBir1 
seropositivity in univariate analyses (data not shown). Patients with perianal involvement 
were more likely to be male, to receive anti-TNFα therapy within 90 days of diagnosis, and 
to be positive for both antimicrobial and GM-CSF autoantibody serologies than where those 
without perianal involvement (appendix).
Survival curves showing time to complicating disease behaviours are shown in figure 1A. 54 
patients had stricturing complications and 24 had penetrating complications during follow-
up (p=0·0007 for the comparison). Within 90 days of diagnosis, 191 patients (21%) received 
anti-TNFα therapy (180 infliximab and 11 adalimumab) and 413 (45%) were treated with an

 immunomodulator (thiopurine or methotrexate). We used propensity-score matching to 
obtain a sample of 191 pairs of patients, one of whom received early anti-TNFα and one 
who did not (appendix). Survival curve analysis of this matched cohort showed similar 
progression to stricturing behaviour in patients, irrespective of early anti-TNFα exposure 
(figure 1B). By comparison, progression to penetrating behaviour was three-times reduced in 
those who received early anti-TNFα compared with patients who did not receive early anti-
TNFα, although this reduction did not reach significance in the unadjusted analysis 
(p=0·0675; data not shown). 32 patients received both anti-TNFα therapy and an 
immunomodulator. The small size of this sample prevented further analysis of this important 
subgroup. Response to early anti-TNFα, which was defined as achieving corticosteroid-free 
remission 6 months after diagnosis, was noted in 124 (71%) of the 175 participants with 
available data for this outcome. We did not note a difference in frequency of B2 or B3 
complications after 6 months in anti-TNFα responders compared with non-responders, 
although the small sample size of these subgroups precluded drawing firm conclusions (data 
not shown).
The competing-risk model based on clinical and serological variables is shown in table 2. 
Neither NOD2 genotype (p=0·14 for stricturing disease and 0·39 for penetrating disease) nor 
a polygenic Crohn’s disease risk score (p=0·46 for stricturing disease and p=0·27 for 
penetrating disease) reached significance (data not shown). Only CBir1 seropositivity was 
significantly associated with stricturing behaviour. Older age, African American race, and 
ASCA IgA and CBir1 seropositivity were associated with penetrating behaviour (table 2). 
We tested the discriminant power of the model by randomly splitting the cohort into equal 
test and validation groups and averaging the performance over 1000 iterations. These test 
characteristics included a sensitivity of 66% (95% CI 51–82), specificity of 63% (95% CI 
55–71), positive predictive value of 14% (95% CI 12–17), and negative predictive value of 
95% (95% CI 94–97). The comparative effectiveness of early anti-TNFα was assessed after 
adjustment for differences in factors in the competing-risk model. Early anti-TNFα was not 
associated with a reduction in stricturing behaviour (hazard ratio [HR] 1·13, 95% CI 0·51–
2·51; p=0·76) but was associated with a reduction in penetrating behaviour (0·30, 0·10–0·89; 
0·0296; table 2).
We identified 14 genera associated with paediatric Crohn’s disease (appendix). In addition to 
organisms previously implicated including Clostridiales, Pasteurellaceae, Veillonellaceae, 
Erysipelotrichaceae, and Bacteroidales,12 we identified new organisms, such as 
Campylobacter, Akkermansia, Collinsella, and Desulfovibrio species. The largest increase 
was detected for Aggregatibacter, and the greatest decrease was noted for Roseburia. Several 
organisms were associated with disease complications (appendix). Rothia and 
Ruminococcus were implicated in the development of strictures. Collinsella numbers were 
increased in patients who developed penetrating disease (B3), and Veillonella frequency was 
increased specifically in the ileum. However, the subcohort for whom microbial data were 
available differed from the whole cohort in key baseline clinical features, and so the 
individual taxa were not incorporated in the risk-prediction model for further assessment.
Although there was considerable heterogeneity in the ileal global pattern of gene expression 
(appendix), comparisons between groups showed significant differences in gene expression.

 Genes regulating extracellular matrix accumulation were induced at diagnosis in patients 
who developed strictures (appendix), whereas genes regulating the acute inflammatory 
response to microbes were induced in those developing penetrating disease (appendix). The 
balance between antimicrobial acute inflammatory and extracellular matrix accumulation 
pathways within patients who developed penetrating (B3) and stricturing (B2) complications 
is shown in figure 2A. The extracellular matrix structural constituent molecular function was 
induced to a greater degree in patients who developed stricturing complications relative to 
both those who remained complication-free (B1), and those progressing to penetrating 
disease (figure 2B).
We then tested for differences in ileal gene expression between patients who were predicted 
to be at low risk for a stricturing complication but whose disease progressed, and those who 
were predicted to be at high risk of stricturing disease, but remained free of complications at 
36 months. This analysis identified enrichment for a mitochondrial function gene signature 
in patients in the at-risk group remaining complication free (figure 2C; appendix). 
Conversely, we also noted enhancement of the extracellular matrix gene signature in patients 
who were predicted to be low risk but nonetheless progressed to a stricture (figure 2C; 
appendix).
The first principal component of the extracellular matrix structural constituent molecular 
function gene signature was associated with stricturing behaviour in the risk model (HR 
1·70, 95% CI 1·12–2·57; p=0·0120; table 3). Leave-one-out cross validation showed that the 
model performance increased as this gene signature was added, with an area under the curve 
of 0·72, sensitivity of 69%, and specificity of 71% (table 3). These improved statistics were 
evident despite being based on only a quarter of the sample size of the full cohort available 
for gene expression, in large part because the transcriptome and serology risk factors were 
almost orthogonal (appendix). In fact, eight additional patients who had a B2 complication 
were classified as high risk on the basis of the extracellular matrix gene signature 
(appendix), who otherwise would have been classified as low risk in the model on the basis 
only of clinical factors including ileal location and serology.
Discussion
Because no validated models for prediction of risk of stricturing or penetrating 
complications are available in Crohn’s disease, we did a prospective, inception cohort study 
in children with newly diagnosed Crohn’s disease. We constructed a risk-prediction model 
based on clinical, serological, and host biology. Additionally, we showed that early anti-
TNFα therapy reduced penetrating but not stricturing complications.
Patients with Crohn’s disease typically show inflammatory disease behaviour at diagnosis, 
with some patients’ disease then progressing to stricturing or internal penetrating 
complications.15 Despite increased use of anti-TNFα therapy over the past decade, a 
population-level decline in rates of obstructive complications and surgeries has not been 
recorded.7,17 Although a Danish cohort study showed a reduction in Crohn’s disease 
surgeries between 1979 and 2011, an association with specific drugs was not established.18 
Disease complications, particularly penetrating complications, substantially increase health-

 care costs. Additionally, anti-TNFα therapy is costly. Therefore, models to predict which 
patients with Crohn’s disease are at the highest risk of complications, and estimates of the 
benefit of early anti-TNFα exposure, are urgently needed.19
We found that older age, African-American race, and ASCA and CBir1 seropositivity were 
associated with disease complications. The strongest effect was noted for CBir1 
seropositivity to bacterial flagellin, which is induced at an early age, and could be involved 
in pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease.20 Flagellin is a dominant antigen driving mucosal T-cell 
responses in Crohn’s disease, and both flagellin-specific T cells and antiflagellin antibodies 
exacerbate inflammation in murine colitis.21 We therefore tested for an association between 
ileal microbiota and complications. We identified 14 genera associated with paediatric 
Crohn’s disease. The largest increase was detected for Aggregatibacter, a bacterial taxon 
associated with a decrease in mucosal pattern-recognition receptors.22 The greatest decrease 
was noted for Roseburia, including butyrate-producing bacteria that promote the epithelial 
barrier.23 Distinct taxa were in turn associated with progression to complications, suggesting 
a role in modulation of host biology. These findings will require validation to determine their 
usefulness in a predictive model.
Largely because of the low prevalence of complications in the cohort, the positive predictive 
value of the clinical and serological model was low. We postulated that the ileal global 
pattern of gene expression, as an integrated readout for local host biology, might improve the 
specificity and positive predictive value of the model. The mucosa overlying established 
Crohn’s disease strictures has a pro-fibrotic pattern of gene expression.24 Whether ileal gene 
signatures would reveal these processes at an uncomplicated stage of disease was unknown. 
We detected a pronounced extracellular matrix gene signature in patients who ultimately 
progressed to strictures.25 This gene signature was associated with stricturing complications, 
and improved the discriminant power of the model with respect to specificity and positive 
predictive value. If validated in a future study, the signature detected in the stricturing 
subgroup could help to inform more efficient enrolment into trials of antifibrotic therapies.
This study was ideally suited to test the effectiveness of early anti-TNFα in preventing 
complications. We first did propensity-score matching to account for clinical factors 
associated with early anti-TNFα use, and then adjusted for risk factors for complications. 
Early anti-TNFα in the propensity-matched cohort was associated with a substantial 
reduction in penetrating but not fibrostenotic complications. This finding is consistent with 
previous reports,26,27 although only for penetrating complications. Therefore, earlier 
introduction of anti-TNFα therapy could reduce progression to internal abscesses and 
fistulas, with attendant high morbidity and costs.
Our study has two main limitations. We did not do a randomised controlled trial, which 
would be the gold standard to test the noted reduction in penetrating complications with 
early anti-TNFα use, and therapeutic drug monitoring was not mandated, which could have 
contributed to variation in treatment responses.28 However, this variation probably would not 
have led to a bias between the three outcome groups. In terms of patient phenotyping, we did 
not use central reading protocols for small bowel imaging with MRI or CT enterography, 
which could have led to variation in classification of disease complications. In particular, the

 possible underestimation of children with early fibrosis at diagnosis could explain why anti-
TNFα therapy did not affect progression to stricturing.24,29 Most participants had 
endoscopic ileal inflammation and so biopsies were taken from inflamed tissue. However, 
we were not able to obtain ileal biopsies from inflamed and non-inflamed segments in the 
same patients, and so cannot directly address the degree to which acute inflammation 
affected the gene signatures.
Substantial morbidity is associated with Crohn’s disease complications and thus tools that 
help to communicate the risk of the disease allow for more informed risk–benefit discussions 
about treatment. We have done a large multicentre inception cohort study and derived and 
validated a prognostic model for disease complications, which is suitable for use in clinical 
practice. Older age at diagnosis, African American race, ileal disease location, and ASCA 
and CBir1 seropositivity were associated with increased risk for disease complications. 
These patients could be prioritised for early anti-TNFα therapy, with could reduce internal 
penetrating complications that account for high morbidity and health-care costs in Crohn’s 
disease. Conversely, the high negative predictive value of the model could be used to classify 
patients at low risk for complications with a high degree of confidence. On the basis of the 
validated competing-risk model including clinical and serological factors, 108 (57%) 
patients who received early anti-TNFα therapy were projected to be at low risk and would 
have been deprioritised for this approach if the treatment decision had been based on the risk 
model. For these patients, treatment decisions might be guided by other considerations 
including corticosteroid-dependent or refractory inflammatory disease behaviour, or growth 
failure. In this regard, our previous report in the RISK cohort showed that early anti-TNFα 
therapy was associated with higher rates of corticosteroid-free remission and improved 
growth 1 year after diagnosis compared with patients who did not receive early anti-TNFα 
therapy.30 We now extend those findings by showing a reduction in rates of penetrating 
complications with early anti-TNFα therapy. The clinical usefulness and positive predictive 
value of our risk model was improved by the addition of ileal gene signatures, which merit 
further exploration and validation. Collectively these results advance understanding of the 
pathogenesis of disease complications, and inform more personalised approaches for 
children newly diagnosed with Crohn’s disease.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
Evidence-based models for rapidly progressive Crohn’s disease to guide the use of 
expensive medical treatments such as anti-tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) therapy are 
urgently needed. We searched PubMed and Embase with the terms “Crohn’s disease”, 
“TNF alpha therapy”, “children”, “complication”, “stricture”, “fistula”, “penetration”, 
“biologic”, “natural history”, and “predictive model” for population-based evidence and 
prospective and retrospective cohort studies of the natural history of disease 
complications in paediatric Crohn’s disease, and associated clinical, serological, and 
genetic predictors. The studies identified by our search had small sample sizes, which 
precluded validation of predictors, and most did not follow up patients prospectively from 
the time of diagnosis. Although in several studies investigators developed models that 
included clinical, demographic, genetic, and serological factors, none included data for 
the global pattern of gene expression in the affected gut at diagnosis, or the associated 
microbiota. The available predictive models were therefore limited by lack of validation 
and lack of insight into the biology of refractory disease.
Added value of this study
In our study of 913 children with Crohn’s disease at 28 sites in Canada and the USA, we 
derived and validated a risk-stratification model based on clinical and serological factors 
defined at diagnosis. Our model has very high negative predictive value. We showed that 
early anti-TNFα therapy was associated with reduced rates of internal penetrating, but 
not stricturing, disease complications. We detected a novel ileal extracellular matrix gene 
signature, which, if present at diagnosis, is associated with future stricturing 
complications. Inclusion of this gene signature improved the discriminant power of the 
model with respect to specificity and positive predictive value, and showed the 
importance of fibrogenesis in this subgroup who did not benefit from early anti-TNFα 
therapy.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study adds to data for the natural history of paediatric Crohn’s disease in the era of 
anti-TNFα therapy and provides definitive validation of previously reported clinical and 
serological predictors of disease complications. The diverging rates of stricturing versus 
penetrating behaviour in our cohort with time suggested potential differences in disease 
pathogenesis, and we showed that early anti-TNFα therapy will prevent internal 
penetrating but not stricturing complications. We provide a mechanistic basis for this 
observation by defining a novel ileal pro-fibrotic signature detectable at diagnosis. 
Collectively, these data could facilitate both appropriate treatment choices (early anti-
TNFα to prevent penetrating complications) and rationale testing of novel antifibrotic 
approaches in patients at high risk for stricturing disease in future clinical trials.

 Figure 1. Development of stricturing or penetrating complications during follow-up in the 
competing-risk analysis in the whole cohort (A) and in the propensity-matched cohort (B)
B2 refers to stricturing behaviour, and B3 to penetrating behaviour. (A) includes 35 patients 
with Crohn’s disease who either developed complications during the first 90 days after 
diagnosis, or did not have complete information for disease location at diagnosis, and were 
therefore excluded from the primary analysis. 97 patients developed complications, 63 with 
stricturing behaviour and 34 with penetrating behaviour. In (B), early anti-TNFα therapy 
was defined as exposure within 90 days of diagnosis, and the survival probabilities were 
computed among those staying complication free by 90 days. Among those treated with 
early anti-TNFα therapy, 18 patients developed complications, 14 with stricturing behaviour 
and four with penetrating behaviour. 23 patients developed complications, 12 with 
stricturing behaviour and 11 with penetrating behaviour, among the matched group not 
treated with early anti-TNFα therapy. TNFα=tumour necrosis factor α.

(B2, blue bars) versus penetrating (B3, red bars) complications for 19 gene ontology 
pathways significantly enriched for genes upregulated in pairwise comparisons between the

behaviour, with higher mean expression in B2 either to the right or to the top (and 
correspondingly, higher expression in B1 to the left, or B3 to the bottom). Genes involved in 
ECM remodelling (n=70, gene ontology pathway 0005201) are depicted with blue filled dots

 patients with Crohn’s disease with low risk for complications who nonetheless developed 
stricturing behaviour (B2 low probability†) and patients with Crohn’s disease with high risk 
for complications who nonetheless remained complication free (B1 protected‡). Genes 
involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (n=179, gene ontology pathways 0022900 
and 0045333, in dark red) are almost all upregulated in B1 protected, whereas genes 
involved in remodelling of the ECM (n=68, gene ontology pathway 0005201, in light blue)

B1 or B3 vs B1 (appendix). †Refers to nine patients who developed B2 despite a 3-year 
probability of complication from the competing-risk model below the median of all B2 
(mean 0·048, range 0·029–0·072). ‡Refers to 22 patients who did not develop any 
complications despite being among the top 10% of 3-year probability of complication 
according to the competing-risk model (mean 0·152, range 0·121–0·241). The small sample 
size results in slight significance values, but the coherence of the two pathways is strongly 
indicated by the polarity of the genes in the two signatures on either side of zero.

In the competing-risk model in the overall cohort (n=913), AUROC was 0·7 (95% CI 0·64–0·76), sensitivity 66% (95% CI 51–82), specificity 63% 
(95% CI 55–71), positive predictive value 14% (95% CI 12–17), negative predictive value 95% (95% CI 94–97), and prevalence of complications 
8·5%. These characteristics were calculated from 1000 random split samples; for each, one half was used to validate predictions based on the other 
half. The cutoff set to balance sensitivity with specificity was 0·077. By contrast, for the model based on clinical factors alone, AUROC was 0·6 
(95% CI 0·56–0·69), sensitivity 56% (95% CI 38–67), specificity 63% (95% CI 56–71), positive predictive value 12% (95% CI 10–15), and 
negative predictive value 94% (95% CI 92–95). In the early anti-TNFα comparative effectiveness analysis, the propensity of early anti-TNFα 
therapy use within 3 months of diagnosis in individual patients was analysed, and estimated propensity scores were used to obtain 191 matched 
pairs, each consisting of one patient who received early anti-TNFα therapy and one patient with similar baseline characteristics who did not. 
Prevalence of complications was 10·7% (6·8% for B2 and 3·9% for B3).
