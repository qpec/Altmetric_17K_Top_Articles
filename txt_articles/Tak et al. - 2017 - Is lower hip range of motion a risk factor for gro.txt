ABSTRACT
Background Whether hip range of motion (ROM) is a 
risk factor for groin pain in athletes is not known.
Objectives To systematically review the relationship 
between hip ROM and groin pain in athletes in cross-
sectional/case–control and prospective studies.
Study design Systematic review, prospectively 
registered (PROSPERO) according to PRISMA guidelines.
Methods Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus 
were systematically searched up to December 
2015. Two authors performed study selection, data 
extraction/analysis, quality assessment (Critical 
Appraisal Skills Programme) and strength of evidence 
synthesis.
Results We identified seven prospective and four 
case–control studies. The total quality score ranged from 
29% to 92%. Heterogeneity in groin pain classification, 
injury definitions and physical assessment precluded data 
pooling. There was strong evidence that total rotation 
of both hips below 85° measured at the pre-season 
screening was a risk factor for groin pain development. 
Strong evidence suggested that internal rotation, 
abduction and extension were not associated with the 
risk or presence of groin pain.
Conclusion Total hip ROM is the factor most consistently 
related to groin pain in athletes. Screening for hip ROM is 
unlikely to correctly identify an athlete at risk of developing 
groin pain because of the small ROM differences found and 
poor ROM measurement properties.
InTROduCTIOn
Groin pain is common in sports involving explosive 
movements, directional changes, repeated kicking 
and body contact.1 The aetiology of groin pain is 
unclear and probably multifactorial.2 Seven system-
atic reviews3–9 have focused on factors associated 
with groin pain in athletes. Lower hip range of 
motion (ROM) was a risk factor in four systematic 
reviews,4 7–9 but not in two others.3 6 Mosler et al5 
studied factors that differentiated athletes with and 
without hip and groin pain and found lower hip 
ROM to be associated with its presence.
A recent international agreement reported that 
the hip can be an important cause of groin pain in 
athletes.1 The interference of hip-related pathology, 
hip ROM and groin pain was not examined in 
these reviews. Additionally, there is no clear under-
standing of the paradigm of decreased hip ROM in 
relation to groin pain.10 11
No published prevention or treatment programmes 
for groin pain in athletes focus specifically on hip 
ROM.1 3 A recent meta-analysis of seven randomised 
trials on preventing groin injuries in athletes showed 
a lack of efficacy.12 These prevention programmes 
mainly consisted of active exercise and did not 
examine hip ROM at baseline or follow-up. A review 
appraising existing literature on hip ROM measures 
and their relation to groin pain would assist in the 
planning of new preventative strategies and making 
adequate choices in study designs.
The primary aim of this review was assess 
whether there was a relationship between hip ROM 
and groin pain in athletes. The secondary aim was 
to guide clinicians and researchers in interpreting 
the findings on the relationship between hip ROM 
and groin pain. The key research question was, 
is there a relationship between hip ROM and the 
presence of groin pain in athletes?
MeThOdS
This systematic review was conducted in accor-
dance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guide-
lines. The protocol for this review was registered 
at the PROSPERO register (website; http://www. 
crd. 
york. 
ac. 
uk/ 
PROSPERO) for systematic reviews 
under registration number CRD42015017666.
Search strategy
Before this systematic review the Cochrane Data-
base of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE and PEDro 
were searched for systematic reviews on groin pain 
in athletes involving hip ROM to ensure that a 
similar study had not already been conducted. No 
date restrictions were applied and all databases 
were searched in full up to 1 August 2015 when 
this review process started.
To identify studies that met the inclusion criteria, 
a search was conducted on 1 December 2015 in the 
electronic databases Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL 
and SPORTDiscus without any date restriction. A 
combination of the following keywords and their 
synonyms was used: groin pain, hip ROM, risk 
factors (see online supplementary appendix 1 for 
the full search strategy). Cross-references from 
previous reviews and all retained articles that 
fulfilled the inclusion criteria were screened for 
possible relevance. Additionally, three experts in 
the field were asked whether they had any relevant 
references available from books or other sources. All

Review
results were entered in Reference Manager (Thomson Reuters, 
Philadelphia, USA). Duplicates were removed.
Selection of studies
T
wo reviewers (LE and IT) independently reviewed all obtained 
titles and abstracts to determine possible eligibility. They checked 
full-text versions of all the retained articles and screened refer-
ence lists of these studies and the systematic reviews already 
identified, for other relevant citations. Full-text screening was 
then performed according to the eligibility criteria. The selection 
status of each retained article was discussed and disagreements 
were resolved by consensus. A third reviewer (AW) was avail-
able to discuss ongoing disagreement. A final list of articles for 
further detailed analysis was created.
eligibility criteria
Studies were considered eligible for this review if data were 
presented on hip ROM in athletes in a study evaluating risk of 
developing groin pain (prospective longitudinal study), OR when 
comparing athletes with and without groin pain (cross-sectional/
case series study). Groin pain could be described according to 
the numerous past different definitions in the literature.1
A study was only included if it fulfilled the following criteria:
a. an original study, published in English, German, French or 
Dutch;
b. an observational (prospective) cohort, cross-sectional or 
case–control study;
c. studying athletes as the population of interest;
d. studying groin pain as a variable;
e. studying hip ROM as a variable;
f. presenting statistical data analyses of the relationship 
between dependent and independent variables (groin pain 
and hip ROM).
This review aimed to assist clinicians working with athletes who 
might be at risk for, or have already developed, groin pain. Studies 
on hip and/or groin pain caused by known hip conditions were 
excluded as being outside the scope of this review. Intervention 
studies were excluded, as were studies on cadavers or animals.
data extraction, synthesis and analysis
T
wo reviewers (LE and IT) extracted the following data, using a 
standardised form:
 
►
definitions of groin pain and the accompanying injury 
criteria (used terms, specifications of groin pain and (phys-
ical) examination criteria);
 
►
onset of pain;
 
►
time of existing complaints;
 
►
time loss;
 
►
study setting (sports type and level, gender, country);
 
►
study setting and design;
 
►
details of ROM assessment (movement directions, body 
position, measurement device, reporting of data in appro-
priate Système International units,13 definition of end ROM 
and the number and qualification of assessors).
The study results and outcomes are presented as the number 
of participants, injuries and (injured) hips, including percentage. 
It is reported whether injured players or injured hips were used 
for analyses and which data were provided (per side, for all 
hips or bilateral hips (BH) as sum scores). As a previous injury 
increases the risk of a re-injury, any reporting of re-injuries and 
methodological/statistical considerations (whether correction 
was needed or not) are presented. Data are analysed descrip-
tively. For the studies that supplied adequate continuous data, 
means and SD or SE of means are presented. For dichotomous 
data, ORs/RR with matching 95% CIs are presented. Mean 
differences (MD) for each ROM movement are calculated and 
presented, rounded off to whole numbers as most measurement 
tools have 1° increments.
Risk of bias assessment
We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP
, 2014, 
www. 
casp- 
uk. 
net) check list to assess the risk of bias in included 
studies, and specifically adapted14 15 (LE, IT, MB) it for our 
systematic review. The criteria list contains items on informa-
tion, validity and/or precision in the following categories: study 
objective, study population, exposure measurement, assessment 
and analysis of the outcome and data presentation (see online 
supplementary appendix 2 for the full criteria list).
T
wo independent reviewers (LE and IT) rated each study as 
‘positive’ (+) if it included an item, ‘negative’ (−) if it did not 
include an item, ‘non-applicable’ (NA) if that item was not appli-
cable to that particular study. When no clear information was 
present on this item a ‘negative’ (−) was scored. The reviewers 
compared their results and in cases of disagreement, consensus 
on each item was reached in a meeting. Absolute values and level 
of agreement (Cohen’s κ) are presented. The number of items 
that were rated positively was divided by the total achievable 
(applicable items only) score to provide a ‘quality score’. The 
studies were ranked as a percentage of the maximum achievable 
score, and, relative to this total score, categorised as scoring high 
or low according to the CASP criteria.16 A high score, thus a low 
risk of bias study, was a study that scored positively for >50% 
of the validity/precision items on the methodological quality list. 
A low score, referring to a high risk of bias study, was one that 
scored positively for ≤50% of the validity/precision items.14 17 
Quality scores were obtained for each study type and overall. 
All studies were checked for reporting on conflicts of interest.18
Item assessment
Item assessment was performed by calculating the ratio of posi-
tively scored items/negatively scored items for each CASP item 
over all the studies. When no negative score was obtained a 
‘maximum’ score was assigned and when no positive score was 
obtained a ‘minimum’ score was assigned. This was done in 
order to provide an insight into which items, in general, had low 
or high scores among the studies included.
Strength-of-evidence assessment
The strength of evidence for hip ROM as a potential risk factor 
for, or in association with, groin pain was assessed by defining 
four levels of evidence (see table 1).17 A relationship was rated 
as positive when the risk estimate was increased. No relationship 
was identified when the effect estimate indicated no increased 
risk or a decreased risk of hip ROM or when it was reported 
to be statistically non-significant (p>0.05) without reporting 
the risk estimate. Significant differences were based on means 
with SD and/or matching 95% 
CI. If a study provided neither of 
these two, any information on significant differences (p<0.05) 
between the groups was used.
ReSulTS
Search results of this study
The database search resulted in 784 studies of which 208 
duplicates were removed. Screening of titles and abstracts was 
performed on the 576 remaining references for possible eligi-
bility (see online supplementary Appendix 3) and 29 potentially

Review
relevant studies were screened in full text. After checking 
cross-references, two additional studies were considered poten-
tially relevant and included.10 19 All citations (410 in total) 
from the seven relevant reviews3–9 were manually screened for 
potentially relevant references, which resulted in two additional 
references.2 20 The experts did not provide additional references. 
Finally, 11 of these 33 studies assessed in full text fulfilled the 
criteria and were included for data extraction (see figure 1).
Study characteristics
Seven prospective cohort and four case–control studies were 
included. Heterogeneity of definitions of groin pain and ROM 
was found (see table 2).
Table 3 presents the descriptives of the 11 studies included in 
this review.
The prospective cohort studies lasted for one or two consec-
utive playing seasons. The duration of the playing seasons 
depended on the sport and ranged from 4 months (Australian 
rules football/Gaelic football) to 6 months (ice hockey) or 9 
months (soccer). The results of the included studies are presented 
in table 4.
Methodological quality
There were 35/146 (24%) disagreements (See online supple-
mentary appendix 4) on the risk of bias assessment, resulting 
in a moderate level of agreement of 0.43 (Cohen’s κ).21 All but 
two22 23 included studies had a high-quality score (table 5A). The 
total quality score of all studies included ranged from 29% to 
92%. The score of the seven prospective studies ranged from 
58% to 92% 
and that of the four case–control studies from 
29% to 71%. Three studies did not report a possible conflict of 
interest,23–25 four studies reported a possible conflict19 22 26 27 and 
four studies reported that no conflict of interest28–31 was present.
The item scores for each study type are presented in table 5B. 
Scores <1 
represent items with more negative than positive 
scores. These are considered as scoring relatively low.
The prospective studies had relatively low scores for items 
related to the standards of injury reporting, indicating the need 
to report how often injuries are registered during the surveil-
lance period. This includes checking the injury criteria over time 
with limited interval periods (item 12). Additionally the injury 
criteria need to be clearly reported (ie, physical examination) 
(item 13).
The case–control studies perform relatively low on item (9), 
reporting whether or not the assessors were blinded to the disease 
status of the subjects and item (10) on assessing subjects before 
they developed symptoms or were injured. Item (16) on criteria 
for appropriate analysis (regression analysis) and item (17) on 
presenting probability data (odds) and item (18) on presenting 
confounding variables had relatively low scores.
Table 1 Strength of evidence assessment.
1
Strong evidence
Consistent findings in multiple high-quality cohort and/or 
case–control studies.
2
Moderate evidence
Consistent findings in multiple cohort and/or case–
control studies, of which only one is a high-quality study
3
Some evidence
Findings of one cohort or case–control study or 
consistent findings in multiple cross-sectional studies, of 
which at least one study is a high-quality study
4
Inconclusive evidence
Concerns all other cases—that is, consistent findings 
in multiple low-quality, cross-sectional studies or 
inconsistent findings in multiple studies. The evidence is 
considered to be inconclusive if only one cross-sectional 
study is available, regardless of the quality of this study
Note: Findings are consistent when the results of at least 75% of the studies have 
similar outcomes.

Review
Overall strength of evidence
Table 6 shows the strength of evidence for all ROM measures 
as risk factors, identified by prospective studies, or as differenti-
ating factors as identified by case–control studies.
dISCuSSIOn
This systematic review included seven high quality prospective 
and four case–control studies (two high and two low quality) 
on the relationship between groin pain in athletes and hip 
ROM. Heterogeneous definitions for groin pain/injury and 
measurement techniques for hip ROM prevented data pooling. 
A strength-of-evidence synthesis showed that smaller (<85°) 
total rotational hip ROM (hips and knees 90° flexed) is the most 
consistent risk factor for development of groin pain and differ-
entiates athletes with groin pain from those without. However, 
the number of studies with homogeneous methods (two and one, 
respectively) is limited.
heterogeneity in terminology and definitions
Heterogeneous terminology and definitions, as identified in the 
included studies, has also been highlighted in a Delphi study 
among groin pain experts.32 There was also large variability in 
the injury and time-loss criteria, reflecting different stages of the 
injury spectrum.33 This ranged from inclusion of players with 
pain who were still able to play19 to players with a first-time 
groin time-loss injury34 or those with time loss and pain >6 
weeks.30 The magnitude of time loss ranged considerably from 
missing part of one match to missing >1 
week of play.24 Altering 
thresholds for injury definition affects injury prevalence and 
incidence, which will influence the results and interpretation of 
the study findings.
ROM measures
There are important concerns about heterogeneity and measure-
ment properties to consider when interpreting these data.
heterogeneity
Even though 11 studies report hip ROM and groin pain, the 
strength-of-evidence assessment, indicating total rotational 
ROM measure as being related to groin pain, was based on only 
two studies. Other studies could not be included in this synthesis, 
owing to heterogeneous hip ROM measures, different assess-
ment methods35 and whether or not the analysis was performed 
for each hip19 22 24 28 30 31 or for combined (either internal rota-
tion (IR) or external rotation (ER)25 30 or for bilateral23–30) ROM 
values.
Validity and reliability of hip ROM measures
When measuring rotational hip ROM, the validity will be influ-
enced by the measurement protocol. One specific element is the 
criterion used to determine end ROM. Overestimation is possible 
if the measurements are not conducted in a single plane, or if 
compensation from the pelvis and lower back are permitted.35 
End ROM criteria are generally under-reported,19 23–25 27 30 
which limits assessment of study validity.
A large number of raters (a range of 1–23 raters was found) 
will result in increased rater variability, and this reduces 
measurement reliability,36 37 and increases the standard error of 
measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change (MDC)22 
values for hip ROM measures. Using a single examiner can deal 
with this, but this limits extrapolation of the findings to different 
settings. Electronic assessments of forces applied may be useful 
to increase reliability,38 but this was performed in only one of the 
studies.26 Reduction of compensatory movements and applying 
standardised force with a specially developed examination chair 
has been reported to strongly increase the reliability of hip ROM 
assessment.39
Minimal detectable change
To detect true differences or changes in ROM—that is, changes 
that are not the result of measurement error, differences must 
at least equal or exceed the MDC. No studies in this review 
dealt with this topic. For IR and ER (hips and knees 90° flexed) 
assessed with a goniometer, the SEM (intra-rater) was previously 
reported to be 2° and 3°.38 Computing the MDC, based on SEM 
values according the formula MDC = (1.96×SEM×√2), reveals 
MDCs for both IR and ER of 7°. For assessment with hips in 
neutral extension the SEM (intra-rater) is 2° and 4°,22 resulting 
in MDC for IR of 6° and ER of 11°. The differences found for 
rotational ROM often exceed the SEM, but not the MDC. Thus, 
the available evidence suggests that ROM is not an appropriate 
screening measure for predicting groin pain. Future studies could 
combine data from larger cohorts to improve the accuracy of the 
estimation of risk. However, to pool such studies, homogeneity 
of the items previously discussed in this paper is a prerequisite.
What to consider when performing new studies?
We suggest that future studies should consider examining and 
reporting all ROM measures available for each hip either unilat-
erally or bilaterally and for BH (combined). Appropriate stabi-
lisation of the pelvis, a clear definition of end ROM and forces

differentiating) with groin pain in athletes. (Findings are presented per

Review
applied should be used and described in detail. The number of 
raters should be as low as possible.
ROM and groin pain
The evidence from this review does not support a relationship 
between hip ROM and groin pain, which is at odds with clinical 
perceptions. It has been hypothesised that restricted hip rota-
tions induce increased stress over the symphysis and surrounding 
soft tissues.10 25 40 One cadaver study11 observed that the pres-
ence of cam morphology, which is associated with decreased 
internal rotation,41 increased the shear forces and rotational 
movement of the symphysis. Yet, no in vivo validation has been 
performed of the effects of lower hip ROM measures. A recent 
paper, published after the search period of this review, showed 
that hip ROM, when assessed in a sport-specific way, is lower on 
the injured side in players with unilateral longstanding adduc-
tor-related groin pain.42 It was postulated that this negatively 
affects biomechanical characteristics42 and hinders adequate 
energy transfer between body segments43 during sporting tasks, 
resulting in supraphysiological tissue loading.
Confounders
Previous injury is a risk factor for re-injury.3 T
wo prospec-
tive studies accounted for this by recording re-injuries29 30 or 
correcting for their presence in the analyses, whereas others did 
not.19 24 26 28
Age is a risk factor for groin pain.3 Some prospective studies 
reported participants’ ages for the studied19 26–28 and injured19 27 
populations and accounted for age in the analyses,26 27 30 and 
two19 30 corrected for this association when indicated. However, 
others do not report age.24 29 ROM is related to age and has also 
been shown to decrease in older players and in those playing at 
higher levels.44
When ER and/or IR are studied in isolation, they are not 
risk factors for the development of groin pain. However, when 
combined (summated) to give total rotation, there is an increased 
risk when total rotation is lower. Individual anatomical differ-
ences between version of the femoral neck, resulting in greater 
or smaller ER or IR, may be confounders.45
Smaller internal rotation has been associated with the presence 
of cam morphology.41 This morphological appearance may be a 
confounder as it is highly prevalent in athletes, but the reported 
prevalence estimates have a high risk of bias.46
Therefore, future studies should report and correct for 
previous injury, age and presence of cam morphology, as these 
are recognised confounders for groin pain and ROM.
lIMITATIOnS
We identified many factors that might influence the outcome 
of the selected studies, such as reporting and consistency of 
measurement techniques, which were generally poorly or not 
reported at all. There were also many differences in the defi-
nitions of ‘groin pain’ and ‘injury’. This combination of poor 
reporting and use of heterogeneous injury definitions and 
measurement methods prevented a comparison of many study 
findings. This limited our ability to group studies to provide 
higher levels of evidence.
When consulting the current strength of evidence assess-
ment, ‘strong evidence’ may be an ‘overqualification’ in our 
review. The strength of evidence method used means that 
having two high-quality studies qualifies as ‘strong evidence’. 
For some readers ‘strong evidence’ may intuitively refer to 
a larger body of evidence. A general limitation threatening 
the validity of this, like any other review, is that non-pub-
lished data may exist together with publication bias. A study 
reporting negative findings—that is, no relationship between 
ROM and groin pain, may be less likely to be published. We 
used SPORTDiscus and contacted experts in the field in an 
effort to find other papers. A more comprehensive grey liter-
ature search might have helped. All but one of the studies 
were on male athletes and thus, information from this review 
cannot be extrapolated to female athletes, leaving space for 
new research.
When you are a clinician, seeing patients with groin pain you 
may consider
 
►
Single-observer ROM assessment, when performed with 
measurement devices, can detect changes in hip ROM over 
time. However, the changes may only be true if they exceed 
7˚ for either IR or ER (hip and knee flexed).
 
►
Considering that total rotational ROM of both hips is lower 
in athletes with groin pain, improving it as part of treatment 
should be considered. However, as the differences found are 
generally small, this should not be the only intervention. It is 
also difficult to identify which patients may benefit.
 
►
Screening for hip ROM to prevent groin injury is unlikely 
to detect an athlete at risk. When a large deficit is found, 
prevention can be considered, although what this should 
entail remains unclear.
When you perform research on hip ROM in athletes with 
groin pain and want to contribute to the existing knowledge 
you should consider
 
►
Using clear and generally accepted injury definitions and 
terminology;1 47 48
 
►
Reporting the physical examination findings of injury and 
ROM measurement techniques comprehensively (eg, both 
IR, ER and summated measures) and providing data on 
measurement properties (eg, SEM and MDC);
 
►
Blinding of assessors for participant’s injury status and 
injured side(s);
 
►
Presenting risk estimates (absolute risk/OR/risk ratio), with 
and without confounding variables.
COnCluSIOn
There is strong evidence that lower total hip ROM of both 
hips is a risk factor for the development of groin pain. There 
is strong evidence that internal rotation, abduction and exten-
sion are not risk factors for the development of groin pain. 
Screening for hip ROM is unlikely to correctly identify an 
athlete at risk because of the small ROM differences found, 
which were lower than the known measurement errors.
What is already known on this topic and what this study 
adds
 
► No information exists on how to apply the available 
information on hip range of motion (ROM) and groin pain in 
athletes.
 
► There is strong evidence supporting the statement that 
smaller total rotation (<85°) of both hips at a pre-season 
screening increases the risk of developing groin pain other 
ROM determinants do not.
 
► Hip ROM assessment does not allow correct identification of 
an athlete at risk of groin pain.
