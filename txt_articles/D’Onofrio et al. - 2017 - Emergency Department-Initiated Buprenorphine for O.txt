BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED)-initiated
buprenorphine/naloxone with continuation in primary
care was found to increase engagement in addiction treat-
ment and reduce illicit opioid use at 30 days compared to
referral only or a brief intervention with referral.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcomes at 2, 6
and 12 months following ED interventions.
DESIGN: Evaluation of treatment engagement, drug use,
and HIV risk among a cohort of patients from a random-
ized trial who completed at least one long-term follow-up
assessment.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 290/329 patients (88% of the
randomized sample) were included. The followed cohort
did not differ significantly from the randomized sample.
INTERVENTIONS: ED-initiated buprenorphine with 10-
week continuation in primary care, referral, or brief inter-
vention were provided in the ED at study entry.
MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported engagement in formal
addiction treatment, days of illicit opioid use, and HIVrisk
(2, 6, 12 months); urine toxicology (2, 6 months).
KEY RESULTS: A greater number of patients in the
buprenorphine group were engaged in addiction treat-
ment at 2 months [68/92 (74%), 95% CI 65–83] compared
with referral [42/79 (53%), 95% CI 42–64] and brief inter-
vention [39/83 (47%), 95% CI 37–58; p < 0.001]. The dif-
ferences were not significant at 6 months [51/92 (55%),
95% CI 45–65; 46/70 (66%) 95% CI 54–76; 43/76 (57%)
95% CI 45–67; p = 0.37] or 12 months [42/86 (49%) 95%
CI 39–59; 37/73 (51%) 95% CI 39–62; 49/78 (63%) 95%
CI 52–73; p = 0.16]. At 2 months, the buprenorphine
group reported fewer days of illicit opioid use [1.1 (95%
CI 0.6–1.6)] versus referral [1.8 (95% CI 1.2–2.3)] and brief
intervention [2.0 (95% CI 1.5–2.6), p = 0.04]. No signifi-
cant differences in illicit opioid use were observed at 6 or
12 months. There were no significant differences in HIV
risk or rates of opioid-negative urine results at any time.
CONCLUSIONS: ED-initiated buprenorphine was associ-
ated with increased engagement in addiction treatment
and reduced illicit opioid use during the 2-month interval
when buprenorphine was continued in primary care.
Outcomes at 6 and 12 months were comparable across
all groups.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of the non-medical use of prescription opioids,
the use of heroin, and opioid overdose mortality have escalat-
ed to epidemic proportions, prompting urgent calls for expand-
ed access to treatment for opioid use disorder (previously
referred to as opioid dependence).1–3 Opioid agonist treat-
ment, including methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone
(hereafter referred to as buprenorphine), is the most effective
treatment and is associated with improved health and social
outcomes and disease prevention.4,5 Patients with opioid use
disorder are at increased risk for adverse health consequences,
and often use the emergency department (ED) to treat these
problems. Thus, the ED offers an opportunity to screen for
opioid use disorder, provide interventions and facilitate refer-
ral to ongoing treatment.
We previously published 30-day outcomes from a clinical
trial of patients who met criteria for opioid dependence (cur-
rently classified as moderate/severe opioid use disorder, Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edi-
tion [DSM-5]) that were randomized to one of three interven-
tions: referral, brief intervention or ED-initiated buprenor-
phine followed by 10 weeks of continued buprenorphine
treatment in a primary care setting.6 Patients receiving ED-
initiated buprenorphine with continuation in primary care
were more likely to be engaged in formal addiction treatment
at 30 days than were those in the brief intervention or referral
groups (78% vs. 45% vs. 37%, respectively, p < 0.001). This
finding provides a new paradigm for ED-initiated treatment of
patients with moderate/severe opioid use disorder.

 ED-based interventions typically focus on the acute stabili-
zation and treatment of medical conditions, with the goal of
ED care to engage patients in ongoing treatment. Similar to
ED presentations of exacerbations of other chronic diseases
such as diabetes and asthma, our results demonstrate that ED
providers can initiate buprenorphine treatment for moderate/
severe opioid use disorders and facilitate linkage to
community-based providers including primary care and other
office-based physicians who prescribe buprenorphine. How-
ever, it is unknown how long the benefits of ED-initiated
buprenorphine with continuation in primary care will last.
We now present the results of a cohort from our original
sample and outcomes observed at 2 months (during primary
care-based buprenorphine treatment provided as a part of the
randomized clinical trial) and at 6 and 12 months.
METHODS
Setting and Participants
We report on a cohort of patients that completed at least one
follow-up assessment at 2, 6 or 12 months, who were recruited
into a randomized trial conducted at a large urban teaching
hospital and its affiliated primary care center from April 7,
2009, to June 25, 2013. The methods have been reported in
detail previously.6
ED patients 18 years of age and older were screened using a
20-item health questionnaire containing embedded questions
related to prescription opioid and heroin use. Patients were
excluded if they were non-English-speaking, critically ill,
unable to communicate due to dementia or psychosis, suicidal,
or in police custody. Patients reporting non-medical use of
prescription opioids or any heroin use in the past 30 days were
excluded if they were enrolled in formal addiction treatment,
required hospitalization or were receiving opioid medication
for pain. Patients with an opioid-positive urine test (opiates or
oxycodone) and a Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inter-
view score ≥ 3 for opioid dependence using the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-
IV) criteria7 were eligible for inclusion. Informed consent was
obtained by research associates (RAs). The study was ap-
proved by the Human Investigation Committee of Yale School
of Medicine.
Treatment Conditions
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three
study groups. The use of a computerized stratified randomi-
zation procedure8 by an investigator (MCC) ensured that the
groups were balanced with regard to sex, cocaine use in the
last 30 days, and primarily prescription opioid or heroin use.
Referral. Referral patients received a handout providing
names, locations and phone numbers of addiction treatment
services consistent with their insurance plan in the area and
telephone access. These addiction services included a range of
treatments of varying intensity and duration, including opioid
treatment programs, inpatient or residential treatment, and
outpatient services including intensive outpatient programs
and office-based providers of buprenorphine or other forms
of treatment. The RA avoided motivating statements. Patients
in the referral and brief intervention groups described below
received management of withdrawal symptoms at the discre-
tion of the ED physician.
Brief Intervention. A 10–15-minute manual-driven audio-
taped Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) was performed by
an RA.9 The BNI, described previously,10 was modified for
opioid dependence and contained four components: Raise the
Subject, Provide Feedback, Enhance Motivation, and Negoti-
ate and Advise. The RA discussed a variety of treatment
options based on patient insurance, residence and preferences,
and directly linked the patient with the referral. This included
reviewing the patient’s eligibility for services, obtaining insur-
ance clearance and arranging transportation.
Buprenorphine. Patients in the buprenorphine group received
a BNI and ED-initiated treatment with buprenorphine if they
exhibited moderate to severe opioid withdrawal.11 Sufficient
take-home daily doses were provided to ensure they had
adequate medication until a scheduled appointment in the
hospital’s primary care center, within 72 hours. Buprenorphine
doses were 8 mg on day 1 and 16 mg on days 2 and 3. In the 65
(57%) patients not manifesting opioid withdrawal in the ED,
buprenorphine was provided for unobserved (e.g., home) in-
duction, with a detailed self-medication guide.12
Primary care-based buprenorphine treatment was continued
for 10 weeks by physicians and nurses using established
procedures, with visits ranging from weekly to twice monthly
based on clinical stability.13,14 Clinicians and study investiga-
tors providing buprenorphine treatment were blinded to re-
search assessments. Receipt of buprenorphine treatment was
not contingent upon abstinence from illicit drug use. After
completing 10 weeks of primary care-based buprenorphine
treatment within this study, all patients were offered referral
for transitioning to an opioid agonist treatment program tai-
lored to their stability, insurance and preference in a non-study
community-based treatment setting. As an alternative, patients
who requested it were provided detoxification over a 2-week
period and a referral for ongoing care (e.g., naltrexone and
counseling).
Long-Term Follow-Up Assessments
The long-term follow-up assessments at 2, 6 and 12 months
included the Treatment Services Review,15,16 timeline follow-
back assessment of illicit opioid use in the preceding 7 days,17
and an 11-item validated scale for and HIV risk-taking related
to drug use and sexual behavior.18 Assessments at 2 and 6
months were completed primarily face-to-face (88% and 82%
face-to-face and 12% and 18% telephone, respectively) by
661

 trained, supervised and scripted RAs in a clinical setting
separate from primary care or other treatment sites. The 12-
month assessment was completed primarily by phone (84%
telephone, 16% face-to-face) by the same research personnel.
The RAs were blinded to group assignment and not involved
in any aspect of the patient’s care. Patients who completed
face-to-face interviews at 2 and 6 months also provided a urine
sample for drug toxicology testing. Urine samples were tested
for opioid metabolites (morphine, oxycodone) using a rapid
qualitative immunoassay. Patients did not receive feedback
regarding the results of their urine tests and were informed
that all research assessment data were confidential and not
available to the treatment providers. To minimize bias, sur-
veillance for and determination of all outcome data were
carried out in a uniform manner across all three treatment
conditions. The follow-up assessment sessions lasted between
20 and 30 min on average, and patients received $50.00 gift
cards for participation in each of the follow-up assessments.
Outcomes
The primary outcome for the current study, engagement in
formal addiction treatment at the time of the 2-, 6- and 12-
month assessments, was by self-report using the Treat-
ment Services Review.15,16 Formal addiction treatment
was defined as a range of providers including opioid
treatment programs, inpatient or residential treatment,
and outpatient services including intensive outpatient pro-
grams, office-based providers of buprenorphine or other
forms of treatment. Secondary outcomes, collected by
self-report at 2, 6 and 12 months, included the number
of days of illicit opioid use in the past 7 days and the
summary score of the HIV risk assessment instrument.18
Rates of opioid-negative urine test results were also com-
pared among the study groups at 2 and 6 months.
Data Analytical Strategy
The study sample (N = 290) represented 88% of the
patients enrolled and randomized in the original trial
who provided data during at least one of the 2-, 6- and
12-month follow-up assessments. The numbers of patients
in the referral, brief intervention and buprenorphine
groups who provided data were 79, 83 and 92 for the 2-
month, 70, 75 and 92 for the 6-month, and 73, 78 and 86
for the 12-month assessments, respectively. This followed
sample was comparable to the randomized sample on all
evaluated characteristics, and there were no statistical
differences in follow-up rates across the three groups
(p = 0.654; Fig. 1).
We used chi-square tests or analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to examine the comparability of the three study
groups. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate the statis-
tical significance of between-group differences for all
categorical outcomes (e.g., engagement in formal addic-
tion treatment, rates of opioid-negative urine tests) and we
used ANOVA to evaluate the statistical significance of
between-group differences for all continuous outcomes
(e.g., days of illicit opioid use, HIV risk behaviors) at all
follow-up assessments. All analyses involved two-tailed
tests of significance and were performed using SPSS
version 21 software.19
RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are
shown in Table 1. There were no statistical differences
among groups. Thirty-three percent were seeking treat-
ment for opioid dependence at the index visit, 9% pre-
sented with an overdose, and the remaining 58% were
identified through screening. Patients reported substantial
use of other substances. Mental health problems were
prevalent, with 23% requiring an acute psychiatric evalu-
ation in the ED.
Outcomes
Engagement in Formal Addiction Treatment at the Time of
the 2-, 6- and 12-Month Assessment (Fig. 2).
Patients in the buprenorphine group were receiving formal
addiction treatment at a significantly higher rate at the 2-month
assessment [68/92 (74%) 95% CI 65–83] than those in the
referral [42/79 (53%), 95% CI 42–64] or brief intervention
groups [39/83 (47%) 95% CI 36–58; p < 0.001]. This differ-
ence between the buprenorphine, referral and brief interven-
tion groups did not persist at 6 months [49/92 (53%) 95% CI
43–64; 42/70 (60%) 95% CI 48–72; 39/76 (51%) 95% CI 40–
63] or 12 months [42/86 (49%) 95% CI 38–60; 36/73 (49%)
95% CI 38–61; 49/78 (63%) 95% CI 52–74; p = 0.546 and
p = 0.136, respectively].
Illicit Opioid Use and HIV Risk Behaviors (Table 2).
At 2 months, the buprenorphine group reported significant-
ly less illicit opioid use, with 1.1 (95% CI 0.7–1.5) days of
illicit opioid use in the past 7 days, compared with 1.8 (95% CI
1.2–2.4) in the referral group and 2.0 (95% CI 1.4–2.6) in the
brief intervention group (p = 0.040). There was a significant
temporal trend toward reduction in illicit opioid use in all
groups from baseline to 12 months, but there were no longer
between-group differences.
There were no statistically significant differences among the
three groups regarding HIV risk behaviors at any of the as-
sessment points.
Urine Toxicology. The overall rate of urine sample collection
was 224/290 (77%) at 2 months and 194/290 (67%) at
6 months. The rates of illicit opioid-negative urine toxicology
tests were not significantly different at 2 months [52/83
(62.7%) in the buprenorphine group, 42/71 (59.2%) in the
referral group, and 41/70 (58.6%) in the brief intervention

 group] or at 6 months [47/74 (63.5%) in the buprenorphine
group, 33/59 (55.9%) in the referral group, and 32/61 (52.5%)
in the brief intervention group].
DISCUSSION
Opioid-dependent patients who received ED-initiated
buprenorphine with continuation in primary care were
more likely to be engaged in treatment and reported less
use of illicit opioids at the time of follow-up assessments
at 2 months. The 2-month assessment occurred while
patients were still receiving buprenorphine through pri-
mary care, as the study treatment was provided for a total
of 10 weeks. These differences in outcomes did not
persist at the 6- and 12-month follow-up. After 10 weeks,
patients were transitioned to other outpatient treatment
providers offering treatments for opioid dependence or
were tapered off buprenorphine, depending on patient
preference and insurance coverage. It is unlikely that
engagement in treatment at 6 and 12 months was related
to the ED-initiated buprenorphine or 10-week buprenor-
phine treatment provided as part of this study. There were
no significant differences in HIV risk behaviors or rates
of opioid-negative urine test results at any assessment
point.
This study demonstrates that the relative benefit of ED-
initiated buprenorphine with referral for ongoing treatment in
primary care persists at 2 months. Our findings at 2 months
in the buprenorphine treatment group are consistent with
those of other studies of primary care office-based buprenor-
phine treatment for opioid dependence. For example, in a

 14-week clinical trial in prescription opioid-dependent indi-
viduals, which compared the efficacy of buprenorphine taper
versus ongoing maintenance in primary care, 66% of
patients in the maintenance group remained in treatment at
14 weeks, compared to 76% at 2 months in our current
study.20 Similarly, another study in primary care reported
that 78% remained in treatment at 12 weeks.21 Thus, our
findings at 2 months are consistent with previous research on
the use on buprenorphine in primary care. In the current
study, patients in the buprenorphine group were transitioned
to other treatment providers or tapered off buprenorphine
after 10 weeks. While we do not have information on the
specific treatments these patients selected, we do know from
previous research that buprenorphine tapering is much less
efficacious than ongoing buprenorphine therapy in terms of
both treatment retention and illicit opioid use.20 Longer-term
outcome studies on buprenorphine in primary care have
demonstrated retention rates including 59% at 24 weeks,22
55% at 6 months,23 44% and 57% at 12 months,24,25 and
38% at 2 years.26

D’Onofrio et al.: ED-Initiated Buprenorphine Long-Term Outcomes
JGIM
 This study has several limitations. First, this paper reports
on a cohort of patients with long-term follow-up, representing
88% of our original randomized trial sample. The 39 patients
lost to follow-up (11 buprenorphine, 14 brief intervention, 14
referral) did not differ from the followed cohort with regard to
age, gender, type of drugs used, injection drug use, medical
insurance status, treatment-seeking status or presentation with
an overdose. We also utilized one ED and one site for primary
care-based buprenorphine treatment—both of which are locat-
ed at the same urban academic medical center. Future studies
will need to demonstrate that this approach is generalizable to
other settings suitable for the provision of buprenorphine
treatment in this manner. While the fact that these two sites
were part of the same institution may seem to be a limitation of
the study, it may also serve as a model for how these services
can be effectively integrated within a medical center or health
care system that provides comprehensive health care services.
Such models are becoming increasingly prevalent as consoli-
dation occurs within the U.S. health care system. In addition,
the data regarding engagement in formal addiction treatment at
2, 6 and 12 months are based on self-report and were not
confirmed with treatment providers. We attempted to limit bias
and social desirability by completing 2- and 6-month assess-
ments in a clinical setting separate from primary care or other
treatment sites conducted by RAs not involved in any aspect
of their care. Patients were informed that their answers and
urine test results were confidential and were stored in de-
identified (anonymous) form in the data sets, and that reim-
bursement for their time was not dependent on their responses.
We focused on engagement in treatment at specific time
points, which does not take into consideration that patients
may have been engaged in treatment at other times. While this
may underestimate the true proportion of patients engaged in
treatment, we believe this is appropriate given the relapsing
nature of opioid use disorder. The outcomes observed in the
referral and brief intervention groups may appear better than
expected. This could be due to the extent to which these
conditions provided resources that are beyond usual care, the
availability of treatment resources in the surrounding area, or
other unmeasured confounders. To our knowledge, no other
study has followed an ED population of patients with opioid
use disorder up to 12 months. Either way, these factors would
bias against a positive finding with the ED-initiated buprenor-
phine treatment condition. Finally, we were able to obtain
urine samples for opioids on only a subset of patients at 2
and 6 months, leading to the potential for bias. For this reason,
and since urine tests assess opioid use only within the prior
72 hours, we caution against placing undue emphasis on these

 findings or the discrepancy between urine testing and self-
report of drug use, which was assessed over a longer 7-day
time frame.
Despite these limitations, our study provides evidence that
ED-initiated buprenorphine treatment with linkage to ongoing
treatment in primary care increases engagement in formal
addiction treatment and reduces self-reported illicit opioid
use while such treatment is continued. For 27% of the enrolled
ED patients, the index ED visit represented their first treatment
contact. Thus, the ED visit is an opportunity to engage patients
with opioid use disorder in effective medication-assisted treat-
ment. Future research should focus on evaluating the imple-
mentation of this model in a diverse array of emergency
departments and other health care settings.
