The strategies that parasites use to exploit their hosts can lead to adverse effects on human and animal popu-
lations. Here, we describe the life cycle, epidemiology, and consequences of hookworm (Uncinaria sp.) disease in
South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis), and propose that hookworm adaptation to fur seal life history
traits has led to maximizing transmission at high levels of parasite-induced anemia and mortality. Fur seal pups
acquire hookworms during their first days of life through their mothers' colostrum and most adult hookworms
are expelled from the pups' intestine 30–65 days later. This gives hookworms little time to feed and reproduce.
However, despite reaching high within-host densities, female hookworms do not decrease egg output, therefore
pups with high hookworm burden contribute disproportionately to parasite egg shedding. These heavily infected
pups also suffer severe anemia and high levels of hookworm-induced mortality. Alternative strategies to max-
imize total egg shedding and/or transmission, such as increased environmental survival of larval stages or
avoidance of clearance, have not been developed by this hookworm. We propose that fur seal hookworms exploit
a live fast-die young life history strategy, which translates to the highest levels of host anemia and mortality
recorded among hookworms.
1. Introduction
Soil transmitted helminths are one of the most prevalent and det-
rimental parasitic infections in the world, with substantial resources
deployed for their control and eradication (Bartsch et al., 2016;
Jourdan et al., 2017). Within this parasite group, hookworms are par-
ticularly pathogenic because they establish long-lasting infections and
exhibit a detrimental feeding behavior for the host (Bartsch et al.,
2016). With the help of well-developed buccal plates and secretion of
several anticoagulant proteins, hookworms cause bleeding wounds in
the intestine in order to feed on host blood (Loukas et al., 2005).
Therefore, in human and animal populations affected by these para-
sites, intestinal bleeding and chronic regenerative anemia are the
hallmarks of infection (Bartsch et al., 2016; Jourdan et al., 2017; Seguel
and Gottdenker, 2017). Additionally, because of the extraction of blood
and loss of protein through the intestine, hookworm infection has been
associated with retarded growth in human and wild animal populations
(Bartsch et al., 2016; Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017).
Despite these adverse consequences for host health, hookworm-in-
duced mortality is rare in humans and animals, with the exception of
pinnipeds (seals, fur seals and sea lions) (Bartsch et al., 2016; Seguel
and Gottdenker, 2017). In pinnipeds, and most specifically otariids
(eared seals), hookworms (Uncinaria sp.) can cause up to 70% of the
total pup mortality during a reproductive season (Spraker et al., 2007;
Lyons et al., 2011; Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017). The reasons for these
high levels of mortality among eared seals are unknown, but in several
otariid species, parasite prevalence and burden are the most important
factors driving host mortality (Castinel et al., 2007; Spraker et al., 2007;
Lyons et al., 2011; Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017; Seguel et al., 2017).
For instance, most necropsied South American fur seal pups (SAFS,
Arctocephalus australis) at Guafo Island (Chilean Patagonia), are infected
with an undescribed Uncinaria sp. but only animals with high burdens
die due to a combination of hookworm lesions and secondary bacterial
infection of these wounds (Seguel et al., 2017).

 For a soil transmitted nematode, pinniped hookworms (Uncinaria
sp.) have been quite successful in a coastal environment that poses
challenges to their survival. Most pinniped hosts form large aggrega-
tions along shores during the reproductive season, yet they spend most
of their time in the ocean (Paves and Schlatter, 2008). Additionally,
many pinniped rookeries are located in latitudes subjected to extreme
temperatures and constant wash of sea and rain water (Castinel et al.,
2007; Lyons et al., 2011; Seguel et al., 2013). Therefore, pinniped
hookworms likely developed alternative strategies to cope with chal-
lenges to their survival and reproduction, resulting in high levels of
mortality in many marine mammal populations. Some of these strate-
gies, for instance, could be related to increased resistance of larval
stages in the environment, prolonged egg shedding in the definitive
host (prolonged infectious period) and/or alternative modes of trans-
mission of infective stages. However, studies in several otariid species
suggest that the life cycle of marine hookworms is similar to terrestrial
carnivores, except that transmission of infective larvae is exclusively
lactogenic (Olsen and Lyons, 1965; Lyons et al., 2011). This suggests
that marine hookworms could have attained high prevalence among
otarrids due to synchronization with the host reproductive cycles, al-
though increased opportunities for transmission through environmental
resistance of larval stages and/or prolonged egg shedding are potential
contributory factors.
In this manuscript, we describe the life cycle and epidemiology of
Uncinaria sp. infection in South American fur seals (SAFS, Arctocephalus
australis) using field data and experiments in order to understand the
dynamics of hookworm transmission in pinnipeds within the context of
high levels of parasite induced mortality. Additionally, the host popu-
lation dynamics were compared with that of the parasite to detect if
synchronization with host reproductive cycles is feasible. Later, to
better understand this hookworm life history strategy in relation to
their pinniped host life history, we observed egg production in hook-
worm females and performed experiments to evaluate hookworm
larvae environmental survival. Finally, we measured hookworm-spe-
cific mortality and anemia in fur seal pups, and examined the total
contribution to hookworm egg shedding in pups that suffered the worst
health consequences of parasitism compared to pups that were barely
affected by hookworms. Based on this approach, we propose that pin-
niped hookworms exploit a live fast-die young life history strategy that
results in few limitations on extraction of host resources and the highest
recorded levels of anemia and mortality among hookworms.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study site and animal handling
The study was performed in the reproductive colony of SAFS located
at Guafo Island, Northern Chilean Patagonia (43° 35′ 34.9″ S, 74° 42′
48.53″ W) (supplementary figure 1). This rookery, of approximately
3000 individuals during the reproductive season, is located over a mix
of sandy and rocky substrates. Pups captures and recaptures were
performed in a rookery sector covered by a thin (3–10 cm) layer of
sandy soil with moderate amount of organic matter over a rocky sub-
strate (supplementary figure 2).
During 2014 (n = 201) and 2015 (n = 206), 1 to 7 day-old pups
were captured by hand and physically restrained. Age of pups was ex-
actly known or estimated using the peak parturition date for Guafo
Island (December 15th) and by assessing the rests of placenta and
umbilical cord in these young pups (Paves and Schlatter, 2008; Seguel
et al., 2016). Placenta is usually loss between 24 and 48 h after birth
and rest of umbilical cord are loss between day 2 and 5 (Paves and
Schlatter, 2008). The exact age of a subset of pups (n = 20) was known
because their birth was observed and they were marked 24 h later.
In each capture, pups were measured, weighed, and blood and fecal
samples collected as previously described (Seguel et al., 2016). All pups
were marked with correlative numbers using a commercial hair
decolorant applied on the fur.
Each year, a randomly selected group of 30 pups, 10 of them of
exact known age (1–2 days old), were treated in their first capture with
400 μg*kg−1 of subcutaneous Ivermectin (antiparasitic drug, control
group) (Delong et al., 2009). Half of these pups (n = 30) could be
monitored throughout the whole study period and were included in the
final data sets.
The pups were recaptured and the sampling procedure repeated on
each pup every 5–10 days during the duration of the study (10 weeks)
and only pups that were captured at least 4 times were included in the
study (76 in 2014 and 73 in 2015).
2.2. Parasitological examination
Due to the lack of standardized methods to obtain a regular amount
of feces from pinniped pups and calculate the number of hookworm
eggs per gram (in part due to the semiliquid consistency of pup feces), a
semi-quantitative protocol of hookworm egg counting was developed. A
fecal swab was collected from each pup and placed in a 10 ml tube filled
with Sheather's sucrose (1.275 specific gravity). In the field laboratory
the swabs were removed from the tubes and additional Sheather's su-
crose was added to the tube to obtain a raised meniscus. A glass cover
slip was placed on top of the tube and after 1-h flotation placed on a
glass slide and observed at 50X magnification with an optic microscope.
The area containing more aggregates of hookworm eggs was selected
and observed at 100X. Starting from this point the eggs were counted in
10 successive, random microscopic fields and the total number in the 10
fields recorded. This same coprological examination protocol was per-
formed on 48 live captured adult female SAFS and in fecal samples (by
embedding the swab in fresh feces) from 58 subadult and adult male
SAFS.
To determine if the fecal egg count was a good estimate of nematode
burden, the standardized fecal egg count protocol was applied to re-
cently dead pups (n = 33). Necropsy was performed on these pups and
nematodes recovered, counted, sexed and identified as previously de-
scribed (Seguel et al., 2011, 2017). In addition, between 2004 and 2017
a total of 15 adult SAFS females and 26 adult SAFS males were ne-
cropsied and carefully examined for presence of metazoan parasites.
In order to determine the average number of eggs per hookworm
female, randomly selected hookworm females (n = 50) and males
(n = 50) from each host (necropsied pups) were measured (standard
body length and width), and females body wall was macerated by
placing them in sodium hypochlorite solution (0.5%) to extract all the
eggs from the female's uterus. Eggs were recovered using a 38 μm sieve
and suspended in a standard volume of saline solution (NaCl 0.9%).
Eggs were counted 3 times using a graded chamber with 1000 μl ca-
pacity. The average of the 3 counts was recorded and the number of
eggs per females calculated based on the total volume of the hookworm
egg solution and the number of females macerated (Hussey and Barker,
1973). The same protocol was repeated using different numbers of fe-
males from the same sample (25, 10, 5, 1), however no significant
differences were detected in the calculated number of eggs per female.
Therefore, the same protocol was applied to samples with small hook-
worm burden using 5, 10 or 25 females per test.
In 2014, 2015 the soil from different sectors of the rookery was
collected. A sector of the rookery was divided in 1002 m quadrants and
5 collection sites were randomly selected within each quadrant (sup-
plementary figure 3). Sampling was conducted in 5 quadrants in early
December and in the same quadrants and other additional 15 quadrants
through mid and late January of each year. All collection sites were
located at least 10 m from the high tide line, because at Guafo Island,
areas with surf wash do not contain soil but large rocks. A standard
volume (50 ml) from a homogenized subsample of soil from each col-
lection site underwent Baermann's test for detection of soil nematodes
using methods described by Olsen and Lyons (1965) in Northern fur
seals (Callorhinus ursinus). These included addition of a few drops of

 concentrated hydrochloric acid to the solution obtained with Baer-
mann's funnels to kill any potential free-living nematodes in the col-
lected sample (Olsen and Lyons, 1965). The obtained sediments were
stained with Lugol's iodine, observed under the microscope and iden-
tified according to published morphological references for Uncinaria
lucasi (Olsen and Lyons, 1965). L3 hookworm larvae abundance was
semi quantitatively recorded in each sample by a single observer using
previously established criteria (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2–4 = moderate,
and 5 > severe). A particular quadrant was assigned to the same ca-
tegories (absent, mild, moderate and severe) based on the larvae
abundance results obtained during January in its 5 samples. The cate-
gory assigned corresponded to the median of the 5 samples (e.g. mild,
mod., sev., sev., sev. = severe). A subset of soil from samples with high
larvae concentration (severe), from 2014 (n = 10) and 2015 (n = 10)
were kept at 10–12 °C (average Guafo Island soil temperature) and
analyzed by Baermann technique after one or two years of storage. The
same Baermann's procedure and larvae identification was applied to
blubber collected at necropsies of recently dead (< 12 h postmortem
interval) SAFS adult females (n = 5), pups (n = 20) and adult males
(n = 2), and to pieces of fresh placenta collected in the rookery with the
difference that hydrochloric acid was not added to the samples. Fresh
placentas were collected immediately after delivery (n = 8) and sam-
pling included collection of at least 4 pieces (4 × 4 cm) per placenta.
Similarly, blubber from 5 to 7 locations in the animal abdomen were cut
into 0.5–1.0 cm3 pieces and wrapped in filter paper to be placed in the
Baermann's funnel (Olsen and Lyons, 1965; Gibbons et al., 2005). In
2015, milk samples were collected from 15 SAFS during the second
week of January. These animals were captured with a net, anesthetized
with isofluorane (4%) and milk collection was facilitated by a single
intramuscular injection (5 IU) of oxytocine (Drag Pharma, Santiago,
Chile) 5 min before collection of a single 25 ml–50 ml sample. Colos-
trum was opportunistically collected from 5 freshly dead adult female
SAFS in December 2013 and 2014. Approximately 25 ml were collected
from each animal. In order to identify hookworm larvae, Baermann
tests were performed in milk and colostrum samples.
Fecal material from a subset of pups (n = 30) was left in an open
plastic box containing previously sanitized (through sun exposure)
rookery soil and left at room temperature at the Guafo Island field la-
boratory. Fecal material and soil from this box was examined every 6
(first 2 days) and 12 h (another 5 days) to assess the development of
hookworm larvae.
2.3. Population end epidemiological data
Fur seal population census data was collected at Guafo Island
rookeries every 3 days during the study period using previously de-
scribed methods for this rookery (Paves and Schlatter, 2008; Seguel
et al., 2013). The prevalence of hookworm infection was calculated
throughout the study by dividing the number of infected pups by the
total number of animals sampled each day. The average number of
hookworm eggs per fecal smear in a given day was calculated by di-
viding the sum of all eggs counted in a day by the number of pups
sampled the same day. The infectious period for a particular pup was
defined as the number of days a pup shed hookworm eggs. This value
was calculated by adding the number of days between the first positive
coprological test and the first capture with a negative coprological test
after the initial diagnosis of hookworm infection. To this value half the
number of days between the last positive and first negative test was
subtracted, according to the following formula:
Infectious Period= (No days between 1st positive and 1st negative
test) - (No days between last positive test and 1st negative test/2).
2.4. Measurements of parasite induced mortality and anemia
Since hookworms are hematophagous nematodes, anemia is one of
the hallmarks of infection and an indirect measurement of the
extraction of resources from the host. Therefore, we used anemia
(measured as low hemoglobin concentration (HG) and/or red blood cell
(RBC) counts) and hookworm induced mortality as indicators of detri-
mental effects of hookworms on the host. RBC and HG were measured
as previously described (Seguel et al., 2016), and anemia defined as HG
concentrations below 10 g/dL and/or RBC bellow 3 × 103/μL, ac-
cording to published reference values for pups in this population
(Seguel et al., 2016). Additionally, we recorded the scaled body mass
(total length/weight) (BM) (Banuet-Martinez et al., 2017), total serum
protein concentration (TP) and white blood cell counts (WBC) as gen-
eral measurements of the pups' health. These indicators were measured
in each capture following previously described methods (Seguel et al.,
2016), and the average for each pup was used for statistical analyses.
The rookery was monitored daily to record dead and alive pups. Ani-
mals found dead during the study underwent complete necropsies and
histopathology to determine cause of death as previously described
(Seguel et al., 2017). Mortality rates were calculated by incorporating
recapture (or re-sighting) data into survival tables, and the final cause
of death recorded according to necropsy and histopathology findings in
that animal.
2.5. Data analyses
2.5.1. Hookworms and fur seal population estimates
The within-host hookworm size variation was checked by assessing
the range, standard deviation and variance of hookworm sizes in a host,
and potential differences in the variances between samples (hosts) were
tested with Barlett's test.
To determine if the burden of hookworm larvae in the soil was re-
lated to pup density, the soil samples were divided in groups according
to their hookworm stage 3 larvae load. Pup density was calculated by
counting the number of pups within each, previously divided, 1002 m
quadrant. The difference in the pup density of these groups was tested
using a generalized linear model (GLM) using pup density as a con-
tinuous response and larvae concentration groups as categorical pre-
dictors.
2.5.2. Within-host density dependence of hookworm egg output
The relationship between the number of eggs in feces and number of
nematodes in the pup's intestine, the number of hookworm eggs in feces
and HG concentration and between number of female hookworms per
host and number of eggs per female were determined by fitting several
linear and polynomial regression models on the log-transformed values.
The model with the lowest Akaike Information criteria (AIC) value and
significant linear or polynomial interactions was selected to fit a curve
with 95% confidence intervals on the graphed data points. To identify
the variables that affected the hookworm female fecundity a general-
ized linear model with negative binomial distribution was fitted using
pups BMI, male and female nematode burden, male to female ratio and
hookworm female length as predictors.
2.5.3. Mortality and anemia
To determine the pup health parameters and hookworm traits that
influenced pup mortality, binomial generalized linear mixed models
were fitted using the number of hookworm eggs in feces, BMI, TP, WBC,
RBC, HG, sex, and infectious period as predictors in the global model
and including year of sampling as a random effect (R statistical software
package “glmmML”). Multiple models were run by adding and sub-
tracting variables and by including interactions between RBC and HG,
HG and PT, HG and BMI, and number of hookworm eggs in feces and
Infectious period in different models. The most adequate covariance
structure was selected based on Akaike's information criteria (AIC)
values of the same models fitted with different covariance (Barnett
et al., 2010). Model selection was based on second order AIC (AICc),
significance of predictors and predictability (mean absolute error).
Statistical inference was done based on the output of top ranked models

253
 (delta AIC < 2.0). Similar approaches were used to construct and select
models (GLMs) with total hookworm egg shedding (burden*infectious
period), number of hookworm eggs in the feces (negative binomial
GLM), HG, and infectious period as response.
After the study, the non-treated pups were divided in animals with
severe and mild hookworm infection based on fecal egg counts. We
used the median of 6 eggs per fecal smear as the cut-off value for the
severe (≥6 eggs) and mild (< 6 eggs) groups because that was the
minimal value at which we observed clinical signs of hookworm in-
fection (e.g. bloody feces). The mortality rates between pups with mild
and severe hookworm infection and the control (ivermectin treated)
group were compared using a Log-rank Mantel-Cox test. The mean RBC
and HG concentrations between groups were compared using one-way
ANOVAs and Tukey's multiple comparison test.
2.5.4. Contribution to parasite egg shedding
In order to test if pups suffering the worst consequences of para-
sitism contributed to most of the hookworm egg shedding in the en-
vironment, total egg shedding in a pup was calculated by multiplying
the number of days a pup was infected with the median fecal egg count
of that pup (obtained from the repeated captures of that pup). Pups
were divided in animals that suffered an adverse health consequence
due to parasitism and those that did not (mortality vs survival, anemic
vs non-anemic) and potential differences in the total hookworm eggs
shedding between the two groups assessed through a GLM with nega-
tive binomial distribution.
In all statistical tests significance was set at α = 0.05 and for model
selection a delta AIC > 2 was considered significant. All statistical
analyses were performed in R 3.2.1 statistical software (R core team,
Vienna, Austria, 2016).
3. Results
3.1. Hookworm and fur seal life history traits
The proposed hookworm (Uncinaria sp.) life cycle in SAFS is sum-
marized in Fig. 1, and is based in several observations. Between 5 and
30 (800–1020 μm in length) stage 3 larvae (L3s) were recovered from
all the colostrum samples collected (n = 5), however no hookworm
larvae were found in any of the 15 milk samples collected in mid-
January, when pups are on average 1-month-old. Similarly, no nema-
tode larvae were found in fresh placentas. In the nematodes collected
from 31 SAFS pups found dead, the difference between the biggest and
smallest female or male hookworm within a host was never larger than
2.2 mm (less than 10% total nematode length) and the range of the
standard deviations in standard length across all samples ranged be-
tween 0.14 and 0.44 mm (supplementary table 1). These intrahost
differences included at least 2 cases where only immature hookworms
were found in the intestine (supplementary table 1), suggesting that
ingestion of larvae occurs during a short period of time. None of the 10
pups treated with ivermectin one day after birth, and none of the 20
pups treated at 2-5 days-old became re-infected. All these findings
suggest that infection occurs most likely through colostrum during the
pup's first days of life. The 10 pups of known age that were not treated
with ivermectin released Uncinaria sp. eight-celled eggs 14–18 days
after consumption of colostrum during their first days of life (prepatent
period mean = 16.1 ± 1.6), and these eggs embryonated at Guafo Is-
land
room
temperature
(12–14 °C)
within
24–72 h
(n = 33,
mean = 46.9 ± 13.2). L2 development occurred in ovo, and within
48–72 h (n = 33, mean = 55.2 ± 7.9), L3s were released from the
eggs. Recovery of infective L3s was common in the rookery soil in
January (79.5% of positive samples, 39/49) but larvae were almost not
present in the same places (quadrants) sampled in early December
(0.06% positive samples, 3/50), and only 1 L3 was recovered from all
the soil samples left at 12 °C for one year (n = 20) and no L3s were
recovered in any of the samples (n = 10) stored in the same conditions
for two years, suggesting low environmental resistance of fur seal
hookworm larvae. L3s were recovered from the subcutaneous tissues of
pups (15/20, mean larvae number = 6.25 ± 6.64), adult females (5/5,
mean larvae number = 11.2 ± 7.82) and males (1/2, 7 larvae), in-
dicating that hookworm L3 penetrate the skin of all age/sex animals in
the rookery. No hookworm eggs were detected in the feces of adult
males (n = 58) and females (n = 48) and no adult hookworms were
found in the intestine of necropsied SAFS adult males (n = 26) and
adult females (n = 15).
Approximately ninety percent of the sampled pups in 2014 (67/77,
87%) and 2015 (66/73, 90.4%) shed hookworm eggs (Fig. 2a). The
highest number of eggs were shed on January 7th (mean = 13.1 ±
14.2 eggs per fecal smear, n = 45), when pups are on average 3-weeks-
old and there are large numbers of adult, reproductive, females in the
rookery (Fig. 2b), which are the next host in the hookworm life cycle.
Adult female density decreased in the rookery from 369 animals in
December 15th to 188 individuals in January 20th, a 49% decline in a 5
weeks period. Most pups cleared hookworm infection by the second
week of February (between 4 and 8 weeks after initial infection) and
the infectious period ranged between 9 and 48 days (22.96 ± 8.3 days,
n = 133). Infective, sheathed Uncinaria sp. L3s were recovered in higher
numbers in areas with higher pup density (GLM, X2 = 1303, df = 3,
P = 2.2 × 10−16) (Fig. 2c), suggesting density dependent contamina-
tion of soil with hookworm eggs and L3s.
3.2. Intrahost hookworm density and female fecundity
Fecal smear egg counts were a good estimator of the number of
intestinal
nematodes
(third
order
polynomial
regression,
adj-
r2 = 0.921, P = 2.2 × 10−16) (Fig. 3a). Hemoglobin concentrations of
SAFS pups were significantly and negatively correlated with the
number of hookworm eggs in their feces (linear regression, adj-
r2 = 0.43, P = 1.15 × 10−14) (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the parasites
deplete hemoglobin in a density dependent manner (additional models
outputs in supplementary table 2). The average size of female and male
hookworms was not related with the total number of female or male
hookworms
per
host
(Spearman-rho,
r = −0.23,
−0.15,
P = 0.51–0.71). Moreover, the average number of eggs per female
hookworm was not correlated with the within-host hookworm density
(males, females and total) (linear regression, adj-r2 = −0.03, F = 1.01,
df = 36, P = 0.32) (Fig. 3c), and in multivariate analyses average
hookworm female length was the only significant predictor of the
number of eggs per female (GLM.NB, estimate = 0.069 ± 0.023,
Z = 2.99, P = 0.003), whereas nematode burden was not significant
(supplementary table 3), suggesting a lack of density dependent decline
in egg output.
3.3. Parasite induced anemia and mortality
Fur seal pups with higher hookworm burdens tend to have longer
infectious periods, lower hemoglobin concentrations and a higher
probability of mortality (Table 1) (GLM with negative binomial dis-
tribution, Χ2 = 159.1, df = 9, P = 1.28 × 10−65). Additionally, pups
with higher hookworm burdens had lower numbers of RBC and WBC,
lower body mass (BM) and were usually male, however the relationship
between hookworm burden and these parameters was not statistically
significant (RBC estimate = 6.84 × 10−8 ± 1.21 × 10−7, P = 0.57,
WBC estimate = 2.90 × 10−6 ± 1.57 × 10−5, P = 0.85, Sex male es-
timate = −3.43 × 10−1 ± 2.36 × 10−1,
P = 0.14,

 categorized as mildly infected based on the fecal egg count cutoff value.
There were marked differences in the survival rates of pups with severe
hookworm infection compared to the “mild infection” and “hookworm
free (ivermectin-treated, control)” groups (Log-rank Mantel-Cox test,

In

26 cases they were confirmed to die due to hookworm infection by
necropsy and histopathology (26/53, 49.1%). In the mild infection
group (n = 96), 9 animals died (9.4% mortality) due to trauma (n = 4),
starvation (n = 2) or unknown causes (n = 3). In the ivermectin-
Fig. 1. Life cycle of Uncinaria sp. in South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis). Pups get infected through ingestion of colostrum that contains infective stage 3
larvae (L3s). Within 2-weeks, hookworms reach adulthood in the small intestine and shed eight-celled eggs in the pup's feces. Eggs larvate in the rookery soil and
larvae develop into sheathed infective L3s which penetrate the skin and reach the subcutaneous tissues of all animals in the rookery. However, Uncinaria sp. larvae
only have a chance to reach the next definitive host in females, which give birth and produce colostrum once a year, repeating the cycle. It is very likely that female
pups can keep larvae in their tissues until they reach maturity and pass them to their pup (blue arrow). All males are dead end hosts. (For interpretation of the

milar in hookworm free pups (treated with ivermectin) and those with
mild hookworm infection, however pups with severe infection had
considerably lower values compared to the other two groups (ANOVA,
F = 31.47, df = 2, P = 2.12 × 10−12) (Fig. 4b).
3.4. Hookworm egg shedding and pup's health status
Based on the estimated total hookworm egg shedding parameter
(median burden multiplied by the number of days infected), fur seal
pups with anemia (hemoglobin concentration < 10 g*dL−1) shed on
average more hookworm eggs compared to pups that were not anemic
(GLM with negative binomial distribution, Anemic pups = 1.36 ±
0.23, Z = 5.92, P = 3.09 × 10−9) (Fig. 5a). When the total number of
hookworm eggs shed was calculated for all the studied pups, animals
that were anemic (n = 36) contributed to 61.1% of the total egg
shedding while non-anemic pup contributed to only 38.9% of the egg
shedding despite being the most numerous group (n = 50). Regarding
mortality, fur seal pups that died due to hookworm disease shed on
average more hookworm eggs when compared to pups that survived
hookworm infection (GLM with negative binomial distribution, Dead
pups = 1.40 ± 0.22, Z = 6.16, P = 7.24 × 10−10) (Fig. 5b). Pups that
died due to hookworm disease (n = 26) contributed to 60.7% of the
total egg shedding in the environment whereas pups that survived
hookworm infection (n = 70) contributed to 39.2% of the egg shed-
ding.
4. Discussion
The marine lifestyle of pinnipeds creates a major challenge for a
parasite that depends on the development of larval stages in soil to
complete its life cycle. We suggest that fur seal hookworms have
overcome this problem through tight synchronization with the host
reproductive cycles. Our epidemiological data and evidence from si-
milar studies in other pinniped species suggest that transmission of
hookworm infective larvae to pups occurs only through fur seal's milk
(Castinel et al., 2007; Lyons et al., 2011; Marcus et al., 2014). Since
many pinniped species have highly synchronized birth periods (Paves
et al., 2016), transmission of hookworms occurs with initiation of lac-
tation in a short period of time for most of the pup population. This fact
plus the early clearance of adult hookworms from the pups' intestine
gives pinniped hookworms little time for growth, reproduction, eggs
shedding, and development of larvae in the soil. Thus, an r-selected life
history strategy has been favored in this hookworm species, which
translates into a lack of restriction in the extraction of host resources,
despite reaching high within-host density. This could explain in part
why a third of the pups born each year suffer significant levels of an-
emia and mortality as consequence of hookworm infection, yet these
pups provide more than 60% of the total number of eggs shed in the
environment.
Biological rhythms have been proposed as a significant player in
host-parasite relationships (Martinez-Bakker and Helm, 2015). In the
case of fur seal hookworms, their particular life cycle could be the result
Fig. 3. Correlations between hookworm burden, egg shedding and extraction of
host resources. (a) Hookworm burden is highly correlated with egg shedding in
pup's
feces
(third
order
polynomial
regression,
adj-r2 = 0.921,
P = 2.2 × 10−16). (b) Hemoglobin concentration decreases as the number of
hookworm eggs in pup's feces increase (second order polynomial regression,
adj-r2 = 0.401, P = 2.09 × 10−14), suggesting that extraction of host resources
depends on parasitic burden. (c) Female hookworms harbor similar number of
eggs in their uterus regardless of parasitic burden (linear regression, adj-
r2 = −0.03, F = 1.01, df = 36, P = 0.321), suggesting that there is no decline
in egg output even at high hookworm densities. The solid lines represent the
best fit model with 95% confidence intervals (dashed lines).

 of synchronization with the host reproductive rhythms. In SAFS, as well
as in other studied pinniped species, pups are infected by L3s ingested
through the milk (Olsen and Lyons, 1965; Castinel et al., 2007; Marcus
et al., 2014). In northern fur seals, subcutaneous L3s do not migrate to
the small intestine and experimental infection is only successful if at-
tempted with L3s obtained from pregnant females (Olsen and Lyons,
1965). L3s extracted from the subcutaneous tissue of non-pregnant fe-
males, pups, adult males or from the soil do not mature in the fur seal
pup's intestine (Olsen and Lyons, 1965). Additionally, northern fur seal
pups born by cesarean section, and not exposed to colostrum, do not
develop hookworm infection (Olsen and Lyons, 1965), suggesting lack
of transplacental infection and exclusive lactogenic transmission, as
shown in other hookworm species (Burke and Robenson, 1985). In
SAFS, something similar could happen since our epidemiological and
pathological data (Seguel et al. 2011, 2017), hookworm size variation,
and analyses in fur seals milk, tissues and colostrum suggest that suc-
cessful hookworm colonization of the intestine only occurs during the
first week of pup's life. Although the presence of L3s in placenta and
milk during the 2nd or 3rd week of lactation cannot be completely
ruled out, these potential routes of transmission apparently do not re-
sult in patent infections. The opposite occurs with terrestrial mammal
hookworm species L3s, which can infect the host and reach maturity in
the intestine, regardless of their source or the infection route (skin and
ingestion) (Loukas et al., 2005; Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017). This
suggests that pinniped hookworms have developed efficient mechan-
isms to detect host reproductive status, probably through sensitivity to
mammalian hormones. From the evolutionary point of view, to favor
this trait, there must be a strong selective pressure to favor synchro-
nized transmission in pinnipeds.
In the fur seal hookworm life history, there is remarkable timing in
egg shedding, which is probably associated with the synchronization of
reproductive cycles of SAFS at Guafo Island, where up to 90% of births
occur in a two-week span (Paves and Schlatter, 2008; Paves et al.,
2016). Therefore, most pups in the rookery are born and infected
through their mother's colostrum during a short period of time, which
translates in hookworm egg shedding starting in about 80% of the pups
the first week of January, which is approximately 2 weeks (the pre-
patent period) after the peak births at Guafo Island (December 15,
Paves and Schlatter, 2008). The lactogenic transmission during first

 days of pup life means that eggs released by these pups, once they
become larvae in the rookery soil, could have higher chances to find a
new host (females), in order to continue the parasite life cycle. This
could occur because as shown in this study, the population density of
fur seal rookeries decreases as the reproductive season advances, in part
due to pup mortality, departure of adult males, juveniles, and some
females without pups (Paves and Schlatter, 2008; Paves et al., 2016).
Many of these animals will only return to the rookery the next re-
productive season (Paves and Schlatter, 2008; Paves et al., 2016), and,
given the fact that hookworm larvae do not survive in Guafo Island soil
from one season to the next, the only chances for these animals to come
in contact with hookworm larvae in the soil is during the first weeks of
the pupping season (Late December early January at Guafo Island)
before they leave the rookery.
Terrestrial hookworms live in their hosts' intestine several months to
years thanks to the successful immunomodulation that the parasites
elicit in the host to avoid clearance (Loukas et al., 2005; Periago and
Bethony, 2012; Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017). The short period that
pinniped hookworms have to maximize their transmission due to host
density constraints could explain why this parasite has not evolved
successful mechanisms to avoid clearance. In fur seals, 100% of the
adult hookworms are dead within 4–8 weeks, due to host mortality or
clearance. This short adult life span leaves these nematodes with little
time to feed, growth, reproduce and release eggs, which probably ex-
plains the aggressive feeding behavior of this parasite. Pinniped hook-
worms are the only members of the Ancylostomatidae family that dig
deep into the intestine, sometimes even penetrating the intestinal wall,
causing peritonitis and death (Spraker et al., 2007; Seguel et al., 2017).
Additionally, contrary to terrestrial hookworms (Anderson and Schad,
1985), there is lack of density dependent depletion in marine hook-
worm female egg output, further supporting our observations that
pinniped hookworms are voracious eaters- and rapid extraction of host
resources is probably more important for hookworm fitness than
avoiding host anemia and mortality.
This is one of the few studies that has measured hookworm anemia
and mortality under natural conditions using recapture-resighting
methods (Delong et al., 2009; Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017). At Guafo
Island, about a third of the pups born each year experience anemia due
to hookworms and approximately 17% (26/149) of all pups born die
due to hookworm disease. In other pinniped rookeries, mortalities
Fig. 4. Anemia and mortality are driven by parasite burden. (a) Survival rates

pups that suffer the worst consequences of hookworm
(Uncinaria sp.) infection contribute to most of the egg

 between 40% and 70% have been reported (Spraker et al., 2007,
Marcus et al., 2014), however those percentages correspond to a frac-
tion of the total pup mortality, which usually fluctuates between 10%
and 30% of all pups born in a year (Seguel et al., 2013). Therefore, our
reported mortality rates could be comparable with what has been ob-
served during hookworm epidemics in California sea lions (Zalophus
californianus) (hookworm mortality; 70% of total mortality, Spraker
et al., 2007) and in regular years in Northern fur seals at San Miguel
Island, California (hookworm mortality; 26% of all pups born, Delong
et al., 2009). Mortality due to hookworm infection is rare in animals
other than pinnipeds and it has only sporadically been reported in ca-
nids, felids and ursids (Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017), however the
results of controlled experiments to measure hookworm induced mor-
tality in these species have not been published.
The reasons for the enhanced pathogenicity of pinniped hookworms
is unknown, however, based on the assumptions of the transmission-
virulence trade off hypothesis, parasites should reach virulence levels
that maximize their fitness, or transmission within a population (Alizon
et al., 2009, Alizon and Michalakis, 2015; Schmidt-Hempel, 2011;
Hatcher et al., 2012; Cressler et al., 2015). Although this hypothesis
posits that parasites can evolve different levels of virulence, most host-
parasite systems evolve towards intermediate virulence (Alizon et al.,
2009, Alizon and Michalakis, 2015; Schmidt-Hempel, 2011; Hatcher
et al., 2012; Cressler et al., 2015). In the case of human and animal
pathogens that cause high levels of mortality (e.g. Ebola, avian influ-
enza), these are usually considered novel host-pathogen relationships
where the parasite is not yet adapted to the host population. The
strongest evidence supporting this hypothesis arises from the studies on
the evolution of HIV and myxoma virus in human and rabbit populations
respectively (Fraser et al., 2007; Kerr et al., 2012). In both cases, a pa-
thogen introduced into a naïve population caused significant mortality
initially. However, over time, evolution favored the selection of viral
strains with intermediate levels of virulence (Fraser et al., 2007; Kerr
et al., 2012). In the case of hookworm infection in pinnipeds, there is
most likely a long-standing host-parasite relationship (Lyons et al., 2011;
Seguel et al., 2017; Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017), which has resulted in
remarkable adaptation of the parasite to the marine lifestyle of the host,
favoring, for instance, exclusive lactogenic transmission of infective
larvae to the pups (Lyons et al., 2011; Seguel and Gottdenker, 2017).
Given the lack of density dependent decline in egg production by
hookworm females, it was expected that animals with higher burden
caused most of the egg shedding and suffered the adverse consequences
of parasitism in terms of anemia and mortality. However, animals that
die decrease their infectious period, an important component of the
total egg shedding in the environment (Vanderwaal and Ezenwa, 2016).
Therefore, it could also have been expected that these animals did not
contribute too much to the total hookworm egg shedding. Given the
fact that all pups clear infection, the difference in the days infected with
hookworms between pups that die and those that clear the infection is
probably not large enough to compensate for the higher burden in
animals suffering mortality. In other host-parasite systems, animals
with high burdens that die become “bad infection spreaders” because
they decrease their contact rate and infectious period (Vanderwaal and
Ezenwa, 2016). To compensate for this fact, and to allow the host to
tolerate higher loads and become a better infection spreader, several
parasitic nematodes experience a decline in feeding activity and egg
output (Anderson and Schad, 1985; Irvine et al., 2001). Although this
adaptation decreases the short term individual reproductive output of
the nematode, it allows a better tolerance by the host and prolongs the
infectious period, potentially avoiding sickness behavior, allowing the
infected host to spread the infection more efficiently (Anderson and
May 1985; Anderson and Schad, 1985; Vanderwaal and Ezenwa, 2016).
Therefore, at the end of the nematode life history, it can be beneficial
for the nematode fitness to produce eggs in a slower rate and feed less
intensively in the host (Anderson and May 1985; Anderson and Schad,
1985; Vanderwaal and Ezenwa, 2016). Fur seal hookworms have
apparently developed a different strategy, where there is little restric-
tion in extraction of host resources, and a disproportionate contribution
to the total egg shedding by animals experiencing the worst con-
sequences of parasitism.
Why pinniped hookworms have not exploited other alternatives to
increase their chances of transmission is not clear, but it could be re-
lated to the reproductive ecology and habitat of fur seals and sea lions.
For a parasite with indirect transmission, increasing the environmental
survival of larval stages in the soil would increase its chances of
transmission, however, as shown in this and similar studies (Lyons
et al., 2011), fur seal hookworm larvae do not survive from one re-
productive season to the next. Pinnipeds live on shores with ocean
runoff and in places with extreme winter temperatures (e.g. Alaska,
Antarctica), therefore, lengthened hookworm survival has probably not
been possible, since larvae would have had to survive extreme condi-
tions for at least one year until the next reproductive group arrives to
the coast. However, reaching a fur seal subcutaneous tissues as soon as
possible and remain there until the animal become reproductively ac-
tive seems as a safer and better strategy for a parasite facing harsh
environmental conditions.
Another significant component of parasite transmission is the in-
fectious period. The universal and early clearance of hookworms by fur
seals significantly reduces the parasite time to release eggs. However, it
is possible that extending the infectious period does not payoff as much
in terms of fitness for the parasite as producing more eggs over a short
period of time, due to the marked seasonal density changes in pinniped
populations (Paves and Schlatter, 2008; Paves et al., 2016). Ad-
ditionally,
avoidance
of
clearance
usually
involves
host
im-
munomodulation, which is energetically costly for parasites (Loukas
et al., 2005; Mulvenna et al., 2009), therefore a significant advantage
for the parasite is probably necessary to favor this trade-off.
This study found that adult pinniped hookworms ‘live fast ‘com-
pared to other members of their nematode family. However, they die
young due to host death due to hookworm disease or the universal
clearance that pups experience after 3–8 weeks of patent infection. This
particular life history strategy could have resulted from the many
particularities and challenges that the marine lifestyle of the host im-
poses in a soil-transmitted nematode, suggesting that marine hook-
worms are highly adapted to their hosts. However, this strategy has also
resulted in a lack of restriction in the extraction of host resources and
the highest levels of anemia and mortality recorded in animal popula-
tions due to hookworms, suggesting that “parasite adaptation” is
probably better explained in terms of parasite transmission and fitness
and not necessarily linked to host health status.
