Abstract
Background—Diagnosis of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 
increasing. The present study sought to identify characteristics and medication treatment patterns 
of children with ADHD and compare them by relative age in class, sex, ethnicity, family size, 
sibling order, and other socioeconomic status, as well as find trends in disparity of 
pharmacotherapy.
Methods—This study was based on data from 1 013 149 Clalit Health Services members aged 6–
17 years during 2006–2011. Centrally acting sympathomimetic drug purchases were compared 
according to children’s estimated relative age in class; youngest third (born August to November), 
middle third (born April to July), and oldest third (born December to March). Treatment trends 
were determined and compared according to sociodemographic and family-related factors.
Results—The overall prevalence of stimulant use in the population was 2.6% in 2006 and 4.9% 
in 2011. The annual incidence of stimulant use increased from 0.75% to 1.36%, rising more 
sharply among children in the older age groups (≥12) than among younger ones. Moreover, the 
youngest third of children in class was more likely to use medication than the oldest third (risk 
ratio (RR) 1.17, confidence interval (CI) 1.12–1.23) or the middle third (RR 1.06, CI 1.01–1.11). 
Of the different ethnic sectors, incidence of stimulant use was highest among general Jewish (1.8% 
in 2011) and lowest among Arabs (0.37% in 2011).
Conclusions—The use of stimulant medication is growing among children in Israel. Although 
the overall use does not exceed the estimated prevalence of ADHD among children, the 
appropriateness of prescribing to the Israeli pediatric population, especially to the youngest 
children in class, may be questionable.

INTRODUCTION
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a commonly diagnosed mental condition 
in children and may have lasting effects through adolescence and into adulthood.1–3 The 
pediatric diagnosis of ADHD typically involves a several-step process based on clinical 
evaluation, teacher ratings of behavior and school performance in school, and parental rating 
scales.4 Relative immaturity among peers may be a contributing factor in the evaluation of 
ADHD symptoms and medication prescribing; there is an excess risk of being identified 
with ADHD among children born shortly before school eligibility cutoff dates, compared 
with children born soon after the cutoff date. In North America and Iceland, countries where 
rates of medication use for ADHD are among the world’s highest,5 children youngest in the 
classroom are 1.5-fold to twofold more likely to be diagnosed or medicated for ADHD than 
their older classmates.6–8 Halldner et al. demonstrated an association of somewhat lower 
magnitude (odds ratio, 1.2–1.8) among children in Sweden, peaking at the age when they 
start school, at age 6 to 7 years.9 In Denmark,10,11 where prescribing of stimulants and 
medication for ADHD is still relatively conservative and school-entry age is flexible, there 
was a near absence of such a relative age effect. This suggests that such relative age effects 
are less likely to be artifacts in countries with more rigid school-entry cutoffs.
As in many Western countries,12–21 the medication of ADHD in Israel has risen 
substantially over the past decade and a half.22 The overall prescription of stimulants used to 
treat ADHD and covered by the national healthcare system doubled in 2005–2012, from 4.0 
to 9.9 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day.20 Increases in the early to mid-2000s 
have been observed among both boys and girls and across geographically diverse areas.22,23 
Yet, little is known about recent patterns of utilization by sociodemographic and family-
related factors in the Israeli pediatric population.
In this study, we took advantage of being able to study the association between relative age 
in class and medication of ADHD among the Israeli children within a time frame when 
diagnostic trends were also changing. Further, we were able to assess the impact of 
sociodemographic and family factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity (general 
Jewish, Arab, and ultra-Orthodox Jewish), birth order among siblings, and number of 
siblings in the family, some of which have not been studied in relation to the relative age 
effect before.
Leveraging unique health data covering half the inhabitants of Israel in 2006–2011 (over a 
million children aged 6 to 17 years), we hypothesized that being young relative to one’s 
classmates increases the risk of being prescribed stimulant drugs for ADHD. We expected 
the relative age effect to be higher in younger children when maturity differences are more 
evident. Further, we hypothesized that this relative age effect increased over the past decade 
alongside rising stimulant use for ADHD in Israel.

 METHODS
Setting and population
We obtained health insurance data from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2011 from the 
Clalit Health Services’ dataset, which covers over 50% of the Israel population. The study 
population comprised all children aged 6 to 17 years (as psychostimulants are prescribed 
only from age 6 years) during the study period with complete information on date of birth 
and at least one full year of insurance coverage. In total, 1 013 149 children were followed 
for a sum of 4 169 264 person-years across the study period from 2006 to 2011. While 
members can freely move in or out of the Clalit health services membership, in fact such 
moves are rare, on average 1% a year. Thus, we had virtually a complete follow-up of the 
population.
Measures
From the Clalit dataset, we obtained information on children’s date and country of birth, sex, 
birth order among siblings (first, second to third, fourth, or subsequent), ethnic sector 
(general Jewish, Arab, and ultra-Orthodox Jewish), clinic-level SES (clinic-level SES, low, 
mid, and high), number of children in the family (one to two, three to five, six, or more), and 
centrally acting sympathomimetic drug purchases by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
classification system (codes starting with N06BA).
The ethnic sector and the SES of each Clalit member are determined by the clinic at which 
the member receives primary care medicine (clinic-level SES). The clinic is classified by the 
Clalit computer services unit according to geostatistical data from the Israeli Central Bureau 
of Statistics (CBS). Sector is attributed as general Jewish, ultra-Orthodox, or Arab by 
majority, and SES is stratified into three layers by the CBS and verified by the clinic 
manager. The general Jewish sector excludes the ultra-Orthodox sector, whose sociological, 
economical, and cultural behaviors are distinct. Given the Israeli social structure, the 
accuracy of ethnicity is well over 95%. SES at individual level during the study period was 
unavailable. Based on present-day data, the intraclass correlation for a single measure is 
0.626, and the association between clinic and categorized individual-level values is fair (κ 
=0.44).
Ascertainment of exposure
We divided children into three relative age groups in class depending on their month of 
birth: oldest third (born December to March), middle third (born April to July), and 
youngest third (born August to November). Relative age in the Israeli classroom roughly 
coincides with the order of calendar months given the nationwide birthday cutoff, which is 
during December, dependent on the lunar calendar. Therefore, the oldest children in class are 
generally born in late December, and the youngest in November or early December. 
Normally, children start school in the calendar year during which they turn 6 years. But over 
the past decade, there has been an increasing tendency to leave children an additional year in 
preschool, and the estimated proportion has increased from 7.9% to 12.2%.24,25 Delayed 
start of school is most common among children born in November and early December. As 
an attempt to validate the consistency of our data and potential effect of delayed school start

 in the cohort, we computed the risks and crude risk ratios of starting treatment according to 
relative age in class, demographics, and family-related characteristics in 2011 where 
November-born children were removed from the analyses (Supporting Information Table 
S2). Further, to assess the sensitivity of the study exposure, we conducted analyses with 
relative age as a continuous linear variable, by month of birth beginning with December.
Ascertainment of outcome
The main study outcome measure was children’s start of stimulant treatment for ADHD. For 
each prescription to study children, we obtained information on the prescribed drug and 
calendar date. We defined the start of treatment to be the first prescription following a period 
of at least 1 year during which children were covered by Clalit insurance when no 
prescriptions for a stimulant drug were filled. After this period, we considered the start date 
of treatment for each child to be the date of the first prescription for a stimulant drug. Given 
our information on historical prescriptions pre-study, we ascertained that this was indeed the 
first prescription ever. Stimulant drugs for ADHD drugs were defined according to the 
World Health Organization Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical classification as drugs within 
the category of centrally acting sympathomimetics (N06BA).26 Chemical substances 
included were amphetamine (N06BA01), dexamfetamine (N06BA02), metamfetamine 
(N06BA03), methylphenidate (N06BA04), and the non-stimulant atomoxetine (N06BA09). 
Children diagnosed with ADHD and covered by Clalit insurance were almost exclusively 
prescribed methylphenidate (Ritalin, immediate and extended release, and Concerta). The 
Clalit data contain all diagnosed health conditions separate from the prescription data; thus, 
we lacked information on the indication for drug treatment. But as an ADHD diagnosis27,28 
by a psychiatrist is a precondition for stimulant treatment among those covered by Clalit, we 
assumed children with filled stimulant prescriptions had an underlying diagnosis.
Data analysis
We first calculated incidence and prevalence proportions as the number of children starting 
stimulant treatment per 100 children in the population (incidence proportion), or filling a 
stimulant prescription at least once (prevalence proportion), during the relevant calendar 
year.29 We used the Cochran–Armitage test to assess time trends in incidence of stimulant 
use stratified by all available covariates.30,31 Incidence proportions were estimated for the 
whole sample by age within grade, as well as stratified by relevant sociodemographic and 
family factors.
We then used Kaplan–Meier curves to estimate the risk of ADHD stimulant treatment for 
each of the three relative age groups; individuals were considered cases based on the age at 
which they first received ADHD treatment; those who never received treatment were 
censored at age 17 years. The beginning of the information was at age 6 years, which served 
as the start date, and we could determine whether indeed children had received treatment 
before this date, in which case they were excluded from incidence and Kaplan–Meier 
analysis.
Finally, we estimated crude and sex-stratified risk ratios (incidence proportion ratios) and 
95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing incidence (risk) of stimulant use according to 
Hoshen et al.

 children’s relative age in class using logistic regression models. We also built a multivariate 
Cox regression model for the age of ADHD treatment onset considering relative age in class, 
sex, ethnicity, and clinic-level SES as effect parameters30,31 and stratified analyses based on 
these characteristics too.
We used R version 3.1.1 for running the statistical analysis.32 Package doParallel33 was used 
to maximize efficiency given the large data size.34 The study was approved by the Clalit 
Health Services Ethics Committee.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the sociodemographic and family-related characteristics of the entire study 
population in 2011. These characteristics did not vary significantly across children’s relative 
age in class. Overall, the population was composed of 56% general Jewish, 38.7% Arabs, 
and 5.2% ultra-Orthodox Jewish, an ethnic distribution that remained stable across 
children’s relative age group.
The overall prevalence of stimulant use in the population was 2.6% in 2006 and 4.9% in 
2011. Both incidence and prevalence of stimulant use varied considerably by children’s 
sociodemographic and family-related characteristics (Figure 1; Supporting Information Figs 
S1 and S2). Throughout the study period, boys were more likely than girls to start stimulant 
treatment (Supporting Information Fig. S1a), and use was most prevalent among children 
aged 9 to 11 years (6.0% in 2011, Figure 1). Of the different ethnic sectors, incidence of 
stimulant use was highest among general Jewish (1.8% in 2011) and lowest among Arabs 
(0.37% in 2011). First-born children and those with fewer than two siblings were more 
likely to start stimulant treatment than those subsequently born or with more siblings 
(Supporting Information Fig. S1d,e). Children from families categorized within the lowest 
clinic-level SES group were less likely to start stimulant treatment than those within the 
higher SES groups (Supporting Information Fig. S1f).
The annual incidence of stimulant use rose from 0.75% in 2006 to 1.36% in 2011, rising 
more among children in older age groups (12–14 and 15–17 years) than the younger age 
groups. The increasing incidence of stimulant use was evident in all ethnic sectors 
(Supporting Information Fig. S1c). A time trend of increasing incidence was significant for 
all population characteristics, according to Cochran–Armitage tests, except among children 
in families with greater than six children and children aged 15–17 years, for which the 
increase trend was not significant.
Table 2 demonstrates the incidence (risk) of starting stimulant treatment across children’s 
relative age in class. Throughout the study period, the youngest third (born August to 
November) in class was more likely than the oldest third (born December to March) and 
mid-third (born April to July) of children to start stimulant treatment (see age and sex-
adjusted incidence, Supporting Information Fig. S3). In 2011, the hazard ratio for the 
youngest third was 1.19 (95%CI 1.18–1.21) and for the middle third 1.08 (95%CI 1.06–
1.10), compared with the oldest third and mid-third in class, respectively (Table 3). This 
excess risk appeared stable across most sociodemographic and family-related characteristics,

 but as children were older, the risk ratio decreased (Table 3). Adjusting for the available 
sociodemographic and family-related factors in multivariable models (Table 3; Supporting 
Information Table S1) did not alter the observed associations.
Figure 2 depicts the cumulative hazard of starting stimulant treatment by children’s age and 
relative age in class based on Kaplan–Meier analysis of the difference of the age of ADHD 
treatment with the relative age in class. Those in the youngest third within grade had the 
highest cumulative hazard (4.3%), followed by those in the middle third (3.9%); those in the 
oldest third had the lowest cumulative hazard (3.6%).
A Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression modeling the age of stimulant treatment 
on relative age in class was estimated, stratified by sex, ethnicity, and SES as effect 
parameters. Comparing the youngest third with the oldest third within class, there was a 
significantly higher risk of stimulant use among both boys and girls, among general Jewish 
and Arab ethnic groups, and among those at any birth order. Risk was also heightened 
among those at younger absolute age, those with less than six children in the family, and 
those in low and middle income.
To assess the effect of delayed school start on the observed associations of stimulant 
treatment according to relative age, we removed children born in November, resulting in 
risks and risk ratios similar to those of the main analysis (Supporting Information Table S2). 
The sensitivity analysis using relative age as a continuous linear variable demonstrated that 
children’s month of birth was strongly correlated with the incidence of stimulant treatment 
(Supporting Information Table S3).
DISCUSSION
In this study covering roughly half the pediatric population in Israel, we demonstrated the 
rising use of stimulants for ADHD over a 5-year period. The annual incidence per 1000 
children increased from 7.5 in 2006 to 13.6 in 2011, mainly among Jewish children, older 
age groups, and within smaller families of higher clinic-level SES. Furthermore, we found 
that in the Israeli classroom, the youngest third of children were at 17% increased risk of 
being treated with stimulants for ADHD, compared with the oldest third. The excess risk 
among the youngest in class remained stable across the 5-year study period and fairly 
similar across most sociodemographic and family-related factors.
Our results from Clalit are consistent with findings of the several large studies conducted in 
North America and Europe demonstrating associations between children’s relative age 
among classmates and the risk of being diagnosed with ADHD or receiving stimulant 
treatment. The estimated overall 17% relative age effect in this study is lower than that 
estimated in Canada (33–77%),21 the USA (50–100%),6,35 Iceland (50%),8 and Sweden 
(20–60%),9 but higher than in Denmark,10,11 where virtually no effect was reported. In 
England, being among the youngest in a school cohort has similarly been positively 
associated with being referred to mental health services.36 In the Israeli school system, the 
parents of younger children often opt, or are recommended by kindergarten teacher, to delay

 commencement of grade school. A specialist panel in consultation with the family performs 
the final decision in such cases.
Mirroring the overall global trends of stimulant use among higher-income countries,21 the 
use of stimulants in the study population rose in near all sociodemographic and family-
related categories. An estimated 5–10% of school aged children worldwide are diagnosed 
with ADHD.37 Our results indicated an overall 4.9% prevalence of stimulant use among 
children in Israel in 2011, and age and gender distribution coinciding rather well with the 
epidemiologic patterns of ADHD.3,38
A relative maturity disadvantage within school grade in childhood has been associated with 
long-lasting negative effects on personal achievements and health outcomes.39–41 
Nevertheless, in our data, the excess risk of stimulant treatment among the youngest children 
in class in our data seemed diminished as children were older in absolute age. This matches 
previous results from Sweden9 and supports the hypothesis that the relative age effect on 
stimulant prescribing is related to maturity differences between the oldest and youngest 
children in class, yielding elevated risks for the least mature children in the classroom. As 
children grow older, the maturity difference becomes less distinct and hence the difference 
in de novo prescribing to these relative age groups. The diminishing effect with increasing 
age may also be consequent to the majority of children being diagnosed with ADHD before 
age 12 years. The diagnostic criteria used during the study period (Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, 10th revision of the International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) required that inattentive or 
hyperactive–impulsive symptoms causing impairment be present by age 6–7 years but have 
since been revised to several symptoms being present before age 12 years (Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition).27,28,42
We set out to examine whether the hypothesized relative age effect varied by other 
sociodemographic and family-related factors, but did not find any substantial differences 
between categories of clinic-level SES, family size, nor birth order among siblings. As many 
previous studies,8,9,11 but not all,7 we did not find a substantial gender difference in the 
relative age effect on stimulant treatment for ADHD. The elevated relative age effect 
observed among children of Arab ethnicity could reflect random variability from small 
numbers within this ethnic category, but it also might be consequent to real differences in 
stimulant prescription to the youngest and oldest Arab children in class. In any case, this 
finding warrants further scrutiny.
Contrary to our hypothesis, the relative age effect on stimulant use for ADHD had no secular 
trend, that is, it did not increase with increasing stimulant use in the population. Thus, the 
rise in stimulant use in Israel was not limited to children with a maturity disadvantage but 
rather a global increase across all children and with stability in the magnitude of the 
association with maturity within grade level. There is concern in the literature about 
“diagnostic creep,” that is, diagnosing and treating children with less severe manifestations 
of the disorder.43,44 We had hypothesized that such a diagnostic creep for ADHD would 
manifest in children with maturity disadvantage, but this was not supported by the study.

 Limitations
This is the first study to examine the relative age effect on ADHD treatment among children 
in Israel. Based on Clalit data covering over one million children, it illustrates the recent 
patterns of stimulant utilization among children in Israel. While the Clalit population is in 
many respects similar to the general population (Supporting Information Table S4), the 
populations are not identical. The Clalit population is somewhat poorer than the general 
population, with a mean income 95% of that of the general population, with 49.9% as 
opposed to 48.1% making up to the national mean income.45 Moreover, overall ethnic 
distribution of the study population, 56% general Jewish, 5.2% ultra-Orthodox Jewish, and 
38.7% Arab, does not fully reflect the total Israeli demographic composition. Overall, Clalit 
members include a higher proportion Arabs than the general population, yielding a slightly 
higher proportion of children within the lowest clinic-level SES than the general population 
and larger families. Thus, our estimates of incidence and prevalence of stimulant use may 
slightly underestimate utilization in the overall Israeli pediatric population, given the 
observed heightened use among children with higher clinic-level SES and lower use among 
Arabs. As almost routinely all children 0–17 years in a family are enrolled in the same 
health maintenance organization, the sibling order distribution relative to the general 
population will reflect this same preponderance of larger family size and hence higher 
sibling order. As children’s relative age in class is unaffected by the demographic 
composition of the study population, the estimated relative age should remain unbiased in 
this respect. A second important limitation is that we estimated children’s grade level from 
their age and school-entry guidelines. We did not have individual-level information on 
whether children were indeed on grade level, that is, whether they had been accelerated or 
delayed from the expected grade level. Thus, exposure misclassification is a possibility. To 
assess the magnitude of such bias, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding November-
born children, that is, those with birthdays shortly before the school eligibility cutoff date, 
which resulted in effect estimates of similar magnitude as in the main analysis. Finally, we 
lacked concrete information on underlying diagnosis, or validity thereof, for medicated 
children. Likewise, we could not study children diagnosed with ADHD but not treated with 
stimulants. Thus, the results of the relative age effect are only generalizable for the use of 
stimulants, not the diagnosis of ADHD.
In sum, we found that the use of stimulant medication is growing among children in Israel. 
Although the overall use does not exceed the estimated prevalence of ADHD among 
children, the appropriateness of prescribing to the Clalit pediatric population, especially to 
the youngest children in class, may be questionable.

 Key Points
•
Diagnosis of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 
increasing.
•
ADHD stimulant medication is common in the primary and secondary school 
populations in Israel.
•
The increased risk of stimulant use among children, who are among the 
youngest in class, compared with children older in class, warrants questions of 
the appropriateness of the ADHD medication prescription in Israel.
