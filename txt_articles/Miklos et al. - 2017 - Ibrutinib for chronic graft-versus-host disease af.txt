Key Points
• Ibrutinib induced a high rate of
sustained responses for
patients with cGVHD and
inadequate response to
corticosteroid-containing
therapy.
• This trial supported the
approval of ibrutinib for
treatment of adult patients
with cGVHD after failure of
$1 lines of systemic therapy.
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic stem
cell transplantation with few effective options available after failure of corticosteroids.

ibrutinib reduced severity of cGVHD. This multicenter, open-label study evaluated the
safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in patients with active cGVHD with inadequate response
to corticosteroid-containing therapies. Forty-two patients who had failed 1 to 3 prior
treatments receivedibrutinib (420 mg)dailyuntilcGVHDprogression.Theprimaryefficacy
end point was cGVHD response based on 2005 National Institutes of Health criteria. At
a median follow-up of 13.9 months, best overall response was 67%; 71% of responders
showed a sustained response for ‡20 weeks. Responses were observed across involved
organs evaluated. Most patients with multiple cGVHD organ involvement had a multiorgan
response. Median corticosteroid dose in responders decreased from 0.29 mg/kg per day
at baseline to 0.12 mg/kg per day at week 49; 5 responders discontinued corticosteroids.
The most common adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, muscle spasms, nausea, and
bruising. Plasma levels of soluble factors associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and cGVHD significantly decreased over time with
ibrutinib. Ibrutinib resulted in clinically meaningful responses with acceptable safety in patients with ‡1 prior treatments for cGVHD.
Based on these results, ibrutinib was approved in the United States for treatment of adult patients with cGVHD after failure of 1 or more
lines of systemic therapy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02195869. (Blood. 2017;130(21):2243-2250)
Introduction
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a serious and life-
threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plantation affecting 30% to 70% of patients.1 It is a leading cause of
late nonrelapse mortality for transplant patients, also contributing to
morbidity and a decrease in quality of life.2-5 Corticosteroids, the
standard frontline treatment, are typically administered for a median of
2 to 3 years,6 leading to substantial morbidity. An effort to decrease
corticosteroid doses has led to their use in combination with other
immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus,
in frontline or second-line settings, despite a lack of clinical evidence
supporting additional efficacy after combining these agents with
corticosteroids.7-12 Patients who have persistent cGVHD after frontline
therapy and require a change in treatment have a 2.5 times increased risk
of nonrelapse mortality13; however, there is no standard of care or
approved second-line treatment.14 An effective treatment option for
patients with cGVHD that fails to respond to initial therapy remains an
unmet medical need.15
Both B and T cells play critical roles in the pathogenesis of
cGVHD.16-19 A lower incidence of cGVHD after in vivo T-cell
depletion confirms T-cell involvement, although higher rates of
infections and relapse of underlying malignancy complicate this
approach.20,21 Host-reactive B cells are also associated with the
development of cGVHD,18 and rituximab provides clinical benefit;
however, alloreactive B cells recur after treatment discontinuation.22
Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, once-daily inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine
kinase (BTK). Activation of the B-cell receptor triggers the BTK
signaling pathway, which regulates B-cell survival.23 Ibrutinib also
inhibits interleukin-2–inducible T-cell kinase (ITK); stimulation of

 ITK, mediated by phospholipase C g (PLCg), is involved in the
selective activation of T-cell subsets that drive immune reactivity
toward healthy tissues.24 In preclinical models, mice that received
BTK- or ITK-deficient bone marrow transplants did not develop
cGVHD, indicating that both kinases play critical roles in cGVHD
pathogenesis.25 By inhibiting both BTK and ITK, ibrutinib has the
potentialtoprovideaclinicalbenefitforcGVHD.Inpreclinicalmodels,
ibrutinib delayed progression and improved clinical manifestations
of cGVHD.25 In a recent analysis of patients with relapsed chronic
lymphocytic leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plantation, ibrutinib was tolerable and effective.26
Based on the biological rationale and compelling preclinical data, a
phase 1b/2 study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
ibrutinib in patients with cGVHD that has failed to respond to at least
1 systemic corticosteroid-based therapy and who needed additional
treatment. Supported by the results of this trial, ibrutinib was recently
approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with
cGVHD after failure of 1 or more lines of systemic therapy.
Patients and methods
Patients
Starting on July 14, 2014, eligible patients were enrolled if they were aged
$18 years, had steroid-dependent or -refractory cGVHD after hematopoietic
stem cell transplant, and had received #3 prior regimens for cGVHD. Steroid-
dependentdiseasewasdefinedascGVHDrequiringprednisone$0.25mg/kgper
day for $12 weeks; refractory disease was defined as progressive cGVHD,
despite treatment with prednisone $0.5 mg/kg per day for $4 weeks. Active
cGVHD was required, and patients were to have either .25% body surface area
erythematous rash or a National Institutes of Health (NIH) mouth score .4.
These manifestations were selected because they were expected to respond
rapidly to an effective therapy, and thus the patient could potentially avoid long-
term exposure to an ineffective therapy.
Pretransplant use of ibrutinib for reasons other than cGVHD, such as for
the treatment of leukemia or lymphoma, was permitted. All patients received
systemic corticosteroid therapy for cGVHD prior to and during the study;
concomitant use of other immunosuppressive therapies including extracorporeal
photopheresis was also permitted; however, preexisting corticosteroid and
immunosuppressant doses must have been stable for 14 days before initiating
ibrutinib. Doses of concomitant corticosteroids and immunosuppressants could
be tapered during the study as clinically indicated.
Study design and treatment
This phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter study was designed to determine the
safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in patients who failed $1 therapy for cGVHD.
Phase1bwasconductedusingamodified31313designtoevaluatethesafetyof
daily oral ibrutinib and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Treatment was initiated at an ibrutinib dose of 420 mg with 6 to 27 patients being
evaluated in phase 1b depending on the frequency of dose limiting toxicities
(DLTs) and need for dose reductions. If unacceptably high DLTs were seen, the
ibrutinib dose could be sequentially reduced to 280 mg and then 140 mg. Patients
in phase 1b who did not experience a DLT were permitted to continue treatment
and follow-up in phase 2 at their phase 1 dose. In phase 2, patients were treated
with ibrutinib at the RP2D along with preexisting immunosuppressants for
cGVHD and followed for signs of progression or improvement of cGVHD.
Approximately 34 patients were to be enrolled in phase 2 with a total target
enrollmentof;40patientsinphase1bandphase2whoweretreatedattheRP2D.
For this analysis, patients were followed until September 1, 2016.
The study (registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02195869) was
approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at
each institution and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization
Guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent.
Study end points and evaluations
The primary end point for phase 1b was safety and tolerability, which included
the number of DLTs occurring within the first 28 days on ibrutinib. The primary
efficacy endpoint for phase 2 was the best overall cGVHD response rate, which
was defined as the proportion of all patients who achieved a complete response
(CR) or partial response (PR). All patients who had at least 1 response
assessment were considered response-evaluable. Nonresponders were defined
as those patients who had stable disease, had progressive disease, or were not
evaluable. The response criteria were based on those provided by the 2005 NIH
cGVHDConsensusPanel27andsubsequentlymodifiedtoincludethefollowing
2 changes based on publication of the 2014 NIH response criteria28: a change in
organ score from 0 to 1 was not considered progression, and an organ was
deemednonevaluableforresponsewhentheorganresponsewasconfoundedby
a non-cGVHD–related factor. Under the original protocol, response assess-
ments were conducted every 12 weeks. A protocol amendment added an
additional response assessment at week 5.
Secondary efficacy end points included sustained response of $20 weeks,
changes in corticosteroid requirement over time, and patient-reported change in
the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale. A decrease by $7 points was considered
clinically meaningful and related to improved quality of life.29 Physicians and
patients also reported overall cGVHD severity scores. Patients were evaluated
for safety; adverse events (AEs) were graded using the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.
Exploratory analyses included pharmacodynamic studies in which the
effect of ibrutinib on immune cell signaling pathways, cytokines, chemokines,
andfactors that promote tissue fibrosis wasevaluated. BTK and ITKoccupancy
was determined using a biotinylated covalent-binding probe to capture all
unoccupied kinase. Pelleted flash-frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells
were resuspended in lysis buffer and split into 2 aliquots: 1 aliquot was
incubated with the probe and the other aliquot was incubated with biotinylated
primary ITK or BTK antibody to determine the total quantity of ITK or BTK
protein in the sample. MSD streptavidin plates (Meso Scale Diagnotics, LLC)
were used to separate biotin-conjugated proteins. The level of unoccupied or
total ITK or BTK protein was quantified with a secondary antibody and Sulfo-
tag detection antibody using an MSD S600 Instrument.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE)–induced basophil activation was assayed via flow
cytometry using markers for CD63, CD123, and HLA-DR according to the
validated procedures indicated in the BD FastImmune protocol (BD Biosci-
ences). Briefly, 20 mL of stimulation buffer plus anti-human IgE was added to
100 mL of heparin blood and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. Degranulation
was haltedbytransferring thereaction to ice and adding 10 mL of 20 mM EDTA.
After staining with the appropriate antibody cocktail, red blood cells were lysed,
and the samples were fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde. Samples were analyzed
using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Activation of PLCg1-Y783 in CD4 T cells was measured using a phospho-
flowanalysis.Viable,cryopreservedTcellswereassayedviaflowcytometryusing

All secondary end points and safety analyses were summarized using
descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and medians for

various time points after ibrutinib treatment. The values at each time point were

 Results
Patients
Six patients were enrolled in phase 1b at a dose of 420 mg. No DLTs
were reported, and as a result, no dose reductions were necessary, and
theRP2Dofibrutinibwasdeterminedtobe420mgdaily.Anadditional
36 patients were treated at 420 mg in phase 2 (total of 42 patients). The
baseline characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1. Patients had
undergone both myeloablative and nonmyeloablative stem cell trans-
plant for a variety of underlying malignancies (supplemental Table 1,
available on theBlood Web site). As expected, mouth and skinwere the
most frequently involved organs, and 85% of patients showed evidence
of cGVHD in $2 organs. The median Karnofsky Performance Status
score was 80, with 60% of patients having a score between 60 and
80.Ofthe42patients,28hadsteroid-dependentcGVHD,6hadsteroid-
refractory cGVHD, and 8 had a history of both steroid-dependent
and -refractory disease. The concomitant immunosuppressive
agents, which were continued during treatment with ibrutinib, are
summarized in supplemental Table 2.
At a median follow-up of 13.9 months (range, 0.5-24.9 months),
12 patients (29%) were still receiving ibrutinib and 30 (71%) had
discontinued treatment. Treatment duration ranged from 5.6 to
24.9 months for the 12 patients who continued treatment. The most com-
mon reasons for treatment discontinuation were AEs (n 5 14), cGVHD
progression (n 5 5), or patient decision (n 5 6); 2 patients discontinued
after resolution of cGVHD symptoms (supplemental Table 3).
Safety
Most AEs were grade 1 or 2 (Table 2), with the most common being
fatigue, diarrhea, muscle spasms, nausea, and bruising. The most com-
mon grade $3 AEs were pneumonia, fatigue, and diarrhea. Infectious
complications of any grade were reported for 29 (69%) patients includ-
ing 15 (36%) grade $3 events. Serious AEs are listed in supplemental
Table 4. Two patients had a relapse of their underlying malig-
nancy (acute lymphocytic leukemia [after 43 days on ibrutinib therapy]
and prolymphocytic leukemia [after 308 days of ibrutinib therapy]).
There were 7 deaths during the study with 2 occurring due to AEs
(multilobular pneumonia and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) while
the patients were on ibrutinib; the other 5 deaths occurred in the follow-
up period after the patients had discontinued ibrutinib, with 3 deaths
attributed to cGVHD and 2 to unknown causes. No major hemorrhage
events were observed. Atrial fibrillation (grade 3) was reported in
1 patient.
Dose reductions resulting from AEs were reported for 13 patients
(31%); the most common AE leading to dose reductions was fatigue
(n 5 6). AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 14 patients (33%), with
themostcommonreasonsbeingfatigue(n53)andpneumonia(n52).
The mediandurationof treatmentwas1.8 months (range,0.2-8.7months)
for patients who discontinued treatment due to unacceptable toxicity.
For the 7 patients with progression of cGVHD, the median time to
progression was 5.6 months (range, 1.7-15.7).
Efficacy
In the all treated population, the overall response rate (ORR), based on
the 2005 NIH cGVHD Consensus Panel response criteria, was 67%,
with a CR rate of 21% and a PR rate of 45% (Figure 1). Five patients
discontinued treatment and left the study before a response assessment.
Excluding these 5 patients, the ORR in the response-evaluable
population was 76%. Of the 28 responders, 20 (71%) showed a

 sustained response for $20 weeks and 22 (79%) showed evidence of
responseattheirfirstresponseassessment.Forthe 24responderswhose
first efficacy assessment was conducted at week 13, the median time
to initial response was 87 days; however, for the 4 responders who
were enrolled after the protocol amendment and whose first response
assessment occurred at week 5, the median time to initial response was
30 days.
Analysis by organ domain showed similar rates of response in the
skin (88%), mouth (88%), and gastrointestinal organs (91%). Of
25 responders with $2 involved organs, 20 (80%) showed a response
in $2 organs (Table 3). Ten of 11 patients who were previously treated
with rituximab had response assessments; 7 (64%) of these patients
responded to ibrutinib. Patients with steroid-dependent cGVHD
appeared to have somewhat better responses to ibrutinib than patients
with steroid-refractory or both steroid-dependent and -refractory
cGVHD with best ORRs of 75% vs 50% vs 50% and CR rates of
25% vs 17% vs 13%, respectively. There did not appear to be a sub-
stantial difference in best response between patients using additional
immunosuppressants at baseline (n 5 22) when compared with those
who did not (n 5 20) with ORRs of 64% vs 70% and CR rates of 18%
vs 25%.
The median corticosteroid dose among responders decreased from
0.29mg/kgperday(range,0.06-1.30mg/kgperday)atbaseline(n542)
to 0.12 mg/kg per day (range, 0.00-0.18 mg/kg per day) at week 49
(n 5 12) (Figure 2). Five responders completely discontinued cortico-
steroidsduringresponsetoibrutinibtreatment.Overall,26patients(62%)
reached a corticosteroid dose of ,0.15 mg/kg per day during the study.
The ORR results were supported by exploratory analyses of patient-
reported symptoms, which showed clinically meaningful improve-
ments (at least a 7-point decrease in Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale
overall summary score) in 10 of the 42 (24%) treated patients on at least
2 consecutive visits. Clinically meaningful improvement in summary
scores was reported for 17 of 28 (61%) responders and 1 of 14 (7%)
nonresponders. The median Total Summary Score for responders
decreased from 32.8 (n 5 28) to 25.7 at week 49 (n 5 15). Median
overall clinician-assessed cGVHD severity score improved from 7
(n 5 41) to 3 at week 49 (n 5 15). A corresponding improvement in
median patient-reported overall cGVHD score from 7 (n 5 42) to 4 at
week 49 (n 5 14) was reported in the all-treated population (Figure 3).
Pharmacodynamic and biomarker studies
Pharmacodynamic studies showed that mean steady-state occupancy
levels of BTK and ITK were 93% (range, 46% to 99%; n 5 36) and
37% (range, 0% to 71%; n 5 38), respectively, on day 8 of treatment.
These steady-state occupancy levels were observed as early as 4 hours
after treatment initiation and persisted for the analysis period. BTK
occupancy was sufficient to effectively block 91% of BTK-driven
basophil activation in an ex vivo IgE stimulation assay. Furthermore,
measurement of ITK-mediated activation of PLCg1-Y783 in CD4
T cells conducted for 4 patients revealed that ITK kinase function was
inhibited by a mean of 73% (range, 52% to 86%) on day 8 (Figure 4).
A biomarker analysis based on samples from all42 patients showed
a significant reduction in soluble plasma factors that are markers of
inflammation and lymphocyte activation, including tumor necrosis
factor-a and soluble CD25. Reductions in several chemotactic factors,
including C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) and C-X-C motif
chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), were observed. An analysis of factors
associated with tissue fibrosis revealed reductions in epidermal growth
factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. These
changes occurred after ibrutinib was administered, and an overall
downward trend was maintained for measured time points (Figure 5).
Discussion
Treatment with ibrutinib in patients with cGVHD that had failed 1 or
more lines of systemic therapy resulted in a high frequency of sustained
responses. The study population was heterogeneous, representative of
many cGVHD patients requiring additional systemic therapy. Using
the NIH cGVHD Consensus panel responsecriteria, ibrutinib treatment

 yielded an ORR for cGVHD of 67% in these pretreated patients, with
nearly one-third achieving a CR. The ORR in the response-evaluable
patient population was 76%, allowing for comparison with histor-
ical reports of efficacy of other second-line therapies. Sustained
response was observed with 71% of responders maintaining
response for $20 weeks. Similar response rates were seen across
affected organs, and 80% of patients with multiple organ involve-
ment showed response in $2 organs. Observed responses were
associated with decreased corticosteroid use and an improvement in
cGVHD symptoms.
Although response rates ranging from 20% to 70% have been
reported in studies of second-line agents for cGVHD,15 these results
were often based on small, uncontrolled trials with suboptimal study
designs. Subsequent randomized studies to confirm the initial results
were all unsuccessful. To explain the discrepancy between the results
of early trials and subsequent randomized studies, Martin et al analyzed
60 early cGHVD trials using 10 clinical trial quality indicators.30
The analysis of these trials, most of which were conducted before
publication of the NIH standardized response criteria for cGVHD,27
showed that the studies satisfied an average of only 2.5 ofthe 10 clinical
trial quality measures.30 The investigators concluded that poor study
design, including lack of rigorous entry, organ response, and overall
response criteria, may have biased the reported efficacy in the early
phase studies, leading to later unsuccessful controlled studies with the
same agents. In 2005, the NIH cGVHD Consensus panel developed
response criteria to improve evaluation of cGVHD response27;
implementation of these criteria has been shown to reduce bias in the
reported efficacy of second-line treatment of cGVHD.31 Although
the NIH criteria were created to provide the most objective assessments
of response, they still represent a subjective determination of cGVHD
activity by the clinician. Because the present study used the NIH-
defined response criteria, the ORR in this study is more robust than
those reported in historical studies.
This cGVHD study is the first to report sustained response as an
efficacy endpoint. This end point is clinically relevant because cGVHD
patients generally require therapy for an extended period, and short-
term responses do not allow for resolution of disabling symptoms or
tapering of corticosteroids. Without a sustained response, the most
common approach to improve response is the addition of new agents
to ongoing therapy with corticosteroids.32 Nearly three-quarters of
responders in this study maintained their response for $20 weeks, and
this was accompanied by meaningful reductions or discontinuation in
corticosteroid use. Although the reduction of steroid doses in this open-
label study couldhave been influenced by the investigators’ assessment
of response, our results suggest that ibrutinib may have a steroid-
sparing effect, which could reduce the morbidity associated with long-
term corticosteroid use.33
The clinical efficacy of ibrutinib in cGVHD is further supported
by an overall improvement in Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale score in
61% of responders. The Lee Symptom Scale directly measures the
effect of ibrutinib on patient quality of life and symptom burden based
on the multiorgan manifestations of the disease.4 The positive effect on
symptom burden among responders was reinforced by a decrease in
cGVHD severity scores reported by both clinicians and patients.
Ibrutinib showed an acceptable safety profile in this pretreated
cGVHD patient population, with AEs similar to those observed in
ibrutinib-treated patients with B-cell malignancies and for patients
with cGVHD treated with concomitant corticosteroids. One-third of
patients discontinued treatment because of AEs. The relatively higher
discontinuation rate for AEs compared with those observed in patients
with B-cell malignancies may reflect that most patients had a low
Karnofsky Performance Status score, comorbidities, and reduced
fitness level, consistent with the relapsed cGVHD population on
ongoing immunosuppressants. As expected for cGVHD patients on
long-term corticosteroid treatment, AEs, including hyperglycemia
and infections, were observed. AEs associated with ibrutinib, such
as major bleeding and atrial fibrillation, occurred infrequently in this
population.

From 
 BTK occupancy of .90% was observed, and target occupancy
results showed higher average engagement of BTK than ITK. Func-
tionally relevant blockade of both kinases was observed, indicating that
both BTK and ITK were sufficiently inhibited to induce biologic im-
pact. These data are consistent with those of prior in vivo CLL patient
experiences.24
Ibrutinib is unique in its abilityto exert effects on B cells and Tcells,
both of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cGVHD.25
Biomarker analyses conducted on this population support the notion
that ibrutinib targets the cellular and molecular pathways responsible
for cGVHD. A striking number of cGVHD-related inflammatory,
chemotactic, and fibrotic factors were significantly decreased across all
patients following ibrutinib therapy, suggesting that ibrutinib could be
impacting resolution of allogeneic inflammation at the cellular level.
Decreases in markers of inflammation and lymphocyte activation have
been reported to correlate with cGVHD development and severity.34,35
Reduction in plasma concentrations of chemotactic factors indicates
a reduction in immune cell recruitment to sites of active cGVHD.36-39
Furthermore, changes in levels of tissue factors associated with fibrosis
suggest a decreased propensity for tissue fibrosis and restoration of
normal organ function.40,41 These findings, together with the demon-
stration of clinical response across multiple organs,support the hypoth-
esis that ibrutinib is affecting cGVHD at a pathogenic level and not just
treating symptoms of cGVHD.
In the absence of an approved treatment of cGVHD that does not
respond adequately to corticosteroids, there is currently no consensus
on the optimal second-line treatment. Treatment choices are empirical
and based on factors such as physician experience, ease of use, need for
monitoring, risk of toxicity, and potential exacerbation of a preexisting
comorbidity.15 The objective and sustained response observed with
ibrutinib,the ability to decrease or discontinue corticosteroiddoses,and
theimprovementinsymptomsamongrespondersprovideevidencethat
cGVHD patients derived broad benefit from ibrutinib treatment. The
clinical benefit and acceptable safety profile, coupled with ibrutinib’s

 ease of administration in an outpatient setting with once-daily oral
dosing, make ibrutinib a promising treatment option for patients with
cGVHD whose disease failed to respond to frontline therapy. Further
validation is necessary, and a randomized phase 3 trial in the frontline
setting (NCT02959944) is underway.
