Frailty is a state that encompasses losses in physical, psychological or social domains.
Therefore, frail people demonstrate a reduced potential to manage external stressors
and to respond to life incidents. Consequently, such persons are prone to various
adverse consequences such as falls, cognitive decline, infections, hospitalization,
disability, institutionalization, and death. Pre-frailty is a condition predisposing and usually
preceding the frailty state. Early detection of frailty (i.e., pre-frailty) may present an
opportunity to introduce effective management to improve outcomes. Exercise training
appears to be the basis of such management in addition to periodic monitoring of
food intake and body weight. However, various nutritional supplements and other
probable interventions, such as treatment with vitamin D or androgen, require further
investigation. Notably, many societies are not conscious of frailty as a health problem.
In fact, people generally do not realize that they can change this unfavorable trajectory
to senility. As populations age, it is reasonable to begin treating frailty similarly to other
population-affecting disorders (e.g., obesity, diabetes or cardiovascular diseases) and
implement appropriate preventative measures. Social campaigns should inform societies
about age-related frailty and pre-frailty and suggest appropriate lifestyles to avoid or delay
these conditions. In this article, we review current information concerning therapeutic
interventions in frailty and pre-frailty and discuss whether a greater public awareness of
such conditions and some preventative and therapeutic measures may decrease their
prevalence.

INTRODUCTION
Frailty is a geriatric syndrome caused by a multisystem decrease in reserve capability and is
associated with a high risk for various adverse outcomes. “Frailty is not synonymous with either
comorbidity or disability, but comorbidity is a risk factor for frailty; however disability is an
outcome of frailty”—pre-frailty is a condition predisposing and directly preceding frailty (Buchner
and Wagner, 1992; Fried et al., 2001). In fact, the frailty state is associated with a variety
of adverse consequences, such as falls, cognitive decline, infections, hospitalization, disability,
institutionalization and death (Fried et al., 2001; Abellan van Kan et al., 2008; Pilotto et al., 2012).
Frail patients present much worse prognoses than non-frail patients, particularly in cardiovascular

diseases (Singh et al., 2014). Moreover, frailty impairs the effects
of invasive treatments in these disorders, e.g., percutaneous
coronary interventions, transcatheter aortic valve implantations
or coronary artery bypass grafting (Singh et al., 2011, 2014;
Green et al., 2012). Frailty also imposes a significant financial
burden on health systems, particularly because frailty appears to
have an incremental effect on ambulatory health expenditures
(Sirven and Rapp, 2017). Awareness of these facts may afford
us an opportunity to develop cost-effective care for this group
of people, resulting in improvement in long-term care and its
outcomes (Wyrko, 2015).However, despite numerous studies
addressing this condition in recent years, frailty as an entity is
not commonly recognized in the general population or even by
some medical societies, and there are no consistent preventative
and therapeutic strategies dedicated to this disorder. Because
population aging is associated with a higher prevalence of
frailty and pre-frailty (Fernández-Garrido et al., 2014; Sergi
et al., 2015), it is necessary to familiarize societies with these
states. Moreover, if we want to improve the quality of life
of elderly persons and reduce expenses for their care in the
future, we should take preventative measures against frailty now
(Wyrko, 2015). Therefore, it is time to begin treating frailty
like other population-affecting diseases such as obesity, diabetes
or hypertension. Appropriate prospective studies are needed
to define which preventative lifestyle interventions should be
implemented to ensure good physical and mental conditions
in senility. Social campaigns could draw societies’ attention to
proper life habits that may be effective to avoid not only diabetes
and cardiovascular diseases but also age-related frailty. In this
article, we review up-to-date information concerning therapeutic
interventions in frailty and pre-frailty and discuss whether a
greater public awareness of these entities and some preventative
and therapeutic measures may reduce their prevalence.
PRIMARY DIAGNOSTIC METHODS OF
FRAILTY AND PRE-FRAILTY
Frailty is a dynamic condition that includes losses in physical,
psychological and social fields; frail people thus present a reduced
capability to manage external stressors and to respond to life
incidents (Buchner and Wagner, 1992; Fried et al., 2001). Until
now, numerous frailty diagnostic tools have been proposed; in
one recent systematic review, the authors identified 67 various
frailty instruments (Buta et al., 2016). The abundance of such
instruments suggests that no agreement on an operational
definition of frailty has yet been reached. Indeed, frailty is
diagnosed with various tools, which in general can be grouped
into two types of conceptualisations: unidimensional, based on
the physical and biological dimension, and multidimensional,
based on the connections between physical, psychological, and
social domains (Figure 1; Fried et al., 2001; Markle-Reid and
Browne, 2003; Carrière et al., 2005; Abellan van Kan et al., 2008,
2010; Gobbens et al., 2010b; De Vries et al., 2011; Roppolo et al.,
2015).
On
the
unidimensional
level,
the
best-known
conceptualisation of frailty is that proposed by Fried et al.
FIGURE 1 | Multidimensional concept of frailty integrating various domains of
human functioning that, by interaction, may accelerate frailty development (the
diagram reflects the structure of the Tilburg Frailty Indicator by Gobbens et al.,
2010b).
(2001), which formed the basis for the Cardiovascular Health
Study Index (CHS), also known as the Physical Frailty Phenotype
(PFP). According to this method, frailty should be defined by
five features: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion,
muscle weakness, slow walking speed and low physical activity,
with the presence of 3 or more of these features denoting frailty,
1 or 2 denoting pre-frailty, and none denoting no frailty (Fried
et al., 2001). Consistent with this type of conceptualisation,
age-related sarcopenia must be a key element of frailty but
is not synonymous with frailty. By definition, age-related
sarcopenia is low muscle mass and low muscle strength or
physical performance when no other cause except aging is
evident (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010; Bosaeus and Rothenberg,
2016). In fact, frailty and sarcopenia overlap one another; a
majority of frail older persons present sarcopenia, although not
all older people with sarcopenia are frail. However, the concept
of frailty, i.e., a general vulnerability to various external stressors,
extends far beyond a physical dimension; a multidimensional

Frailty and Pre-frailty Review
conceptualisation of frailty therefore reflects a wider context of
human functioning (Bauer and Sieber, 2008; Cruz-Jentoft et al.,
2010; Bosaeus and Rothenberg, 2016).
The multidimensional approach to frailty is based on an
analysis of interactions among various domains: physical,
psychological and social (Walston et al., 2006; Abellan van Kan
et al., 2008, 2010; Gobbens et al., 2010b). In this context, frailty
is considered a state affecting people who present losses in one
or more of these levels of human functioning (Mitnitski et al.,
2001; Rockwood et al., 2005, 2007; Searle et al., 2008; Gobbens
et al., 2010a). Such a definition was operationalized into various
tools used to assess frailty (De Vries et al., 2011; Sternberg et al.,
2011; Roppolo et al., 2015). One of those tools is the frailty
Index (also known as the Deficit Accumulation Index, DAI),
developed as a sum of “deficits in health,” i.e., symptoms, illnesses,
physical, and cognitive impairments, disabilities, psychosocial
risk factors, and laboratory abnormalities: more deficits identified
in a given person indicate a greater likelihood that a person is
frail (Mitnitski et al., 2001; Rockwood et al., 2005, 2007). The
frailty index is generally presented as a ratio of deficits identified
in relation to the number of all deficits considered. For instance,
if 50 deficits are considered and 10 are identified, the individual’s
frailty index is 10/50 = 0.2 (Mitnitski et al., 2001; Searle et al.,
2008). The frailty index appears to be consistent across different
studies, although not every frailty index considers similar deficits
or the same number of deficits (Mitnitski et al., 2001; Goggins
et al., 2005; Rockwood and Mitnitski, 2007; Rockwood et al.,
2007; Searle et al., 2008). This index is significantly associated
with adverse outcomes such as deterioration in health status,
risk of institutionalization and death (Rockwood et al., 2007).
However, the greatest concern regarding this approach is that
the frailty index is based on the accumulation of a wide range
of different deficits and consequently must include disability as a
component. The index scarcely differentiates between people at
risk (i.e., frail) and those already disabled (Abellan van Kan et al.,
2010).
One of the recent and quite promising multidimensional
instruments, based on a structural questionnaire, is the Tilburg
Frailty Indicator (TFI) (Gobbens et al., 2010b; see Figure 1). The
TFI consists of two parts: Part A comprises 10 questions on
frailty determinants (e.g., age, gender, marital status, education
level, and way of life); Part B comprises 15 frailty elements
arranged according to three different aspects. The physical aspect
(0–8 points) consists of eight items related to physical health,
unintentional weight loss, difficulty walking, and problems
with balance, hearing, vision, hand strength and physical
tiredness. The psychological aspect (0–4 points) comprises
four components related to cognition, depression, anxiety, and
coping. The social aspect (0–3 points) consists of three elements
associated with living alone, social relations and social support.
The tool’s total score may rank from 0 to 15–by definition, frailty
is established if the total TFI score is at least 5 (Gobbens et al.,
2010b).
Studies comparing uni- and multidimensional measures of
frailty have demonstrated large differences in their ability to
identify frail older adults (Hoogendijk et al., 2013; Theou et al.,
2013; Jung et al., 2014; Roppolo et al., 2015). For example, in
one study, the CHS revealed the highest association with the
physical domain of the TFI, whereas the correlations with the
psychological and social domains were much weaker, although
significant (Roppolo et al., 2015). Importantly, both instruments
presented good correlation with disability; however, the CHS
demonstrated low sensitivity and high specificity, whereas the
TFI exhibited high sensitivity and low specificity. Because frailty
is a preclinical state, it seems better to prefer high sensitivity over
high specificity, rendering it possible to identify persons at risk
who may benefit from preventive management (Roppolo et al.,
2015). However, it should be noted that the CHS with its pre-
frailty state may also be a sensitive measure to detect an early
reduction in reserve capacity in apparently healthy elderly men
and women (Fried et al., 2001).
Early detection of any form of functional degradation
in elderly individuals appears to be critical if one intends
to
introduce
interventions
to
preserve
their
biological,
psychological and social status. Therefore, if frailty instruments
include disability, functional decline and cognitive impairment
as components of frailty, these instruments in fact identify people
who are already disabled (Brody et al., 1997, 2002; Rockwood
et al., 1999, 2005; Saliba et al., 2001; Mitnitski et al., 2002a,b;
Carrière et al., 2005; Ravaglia et al., 2008; Sarkisian et al., 2008;
Avila-Funes et al., 2009). Hence, potential interventions in such
groups would resemble secondary prevention trials (Sternberg
et al., 2011). However, if frailty definitions consider disability,
functional decline and dementia as outcomes of frailty (Chin A
Paw et al., 1999; Fried et al., 2001; Saliba et al., 2001; Carrière
et al., 2005; Puts et al., 2005b; Ensrud et al., 2008; Ravaglia
et al., 2008; Gobbens et al., 2010b), they allow identification of
populations for whom a management plan would be analogous
to primary prevention therapy (Sternberg et al., 2011).
As the transition from disability to robust status is extremely
difficult, it is reasonable to begin addressing the problems of
the elderly in the early preclinical stages (i.e., pre-frailty and
frailty) to stop or delay functional deteriorations. Therefore, in
the selection of a frailty instrument, it is crucial to consider the
intended purpose, clinical context and information regarding
how the instrument has been used in the past (Buta et al., 2016).
PRE-FRAILTY STATE
It has been suggested that the recognition of pre-frailty may
deliver an opportunity to introduce effective management that
may improve outcomes in terms of hospitalization, disability
and mortality (Gary, 2012; Von Haehling et al., 2013). The
incidence of pre-frailty in the elderly aged over 65 years
ranges between 35 and 50% and is much higher than the
prevalence of frailty, which ranges from 7 to 12% in subjects
aged 65 years or more and approximately 25% in those older
than 85 years (Fernández-Garrido et al., 2014; Sergi et al.,
2015).
Pre-frailty is recognized when one or two criteria of the CHS
are met (Fried et al., 2001). The prevalence of such criteria in
pre-frail individuals differs according to various authors. In one
study, the prevalence of these components was found to be 40.5%

Frailty and Pre-frailty Review
for muscle weakness, 29.0% for unintentional weight loss, 17.1%
for low physical activity, 11.5% for self-reported exhaustion,
and 2.0% for slow walking speed (Danon-Hersch et al., 2012);
however, in another study, weakness was the most common
initial manifestation in pre-frail women and low activity and
slowness were the second and third most reported (Xue et al.,
2008). Notably, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss seldom
develop alone but generally occur in conjunction with other
reductions in compensatory mechanisms (Bortz, 2002; Kamel,
2003; Drey et al., 2011). Individuals with exhaustion have higher
scores on the geriatric depression scale, suggesting a correlation
between these two conditions (Drey et al., 2011). In general,
weight loss is relatively rarely observed in pre-frail people and
appears to be associated with the end stage of frailty, which
is strongly associated with mortality (Fernández-Garrido et al.,
2014).
Similar to frailty, pre-frailty is more common in women
than in men and is associated with lower levels of education
and socio-economic status (Raji et al., 2010; Danon-Hersch
et al., 2012). In fact, women accumulate more deficits than
men of the same age, and in both genders, this accumulation
is associated with mortality, although men exhibit a higher risk
of mortality (Mitnitski et al., 2002b; Puts et al., 2005a). There
is a significantly higher level of comorbidities in pre-frail than
in non-frail individuals, with a particularly higher frequency
of chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes
mellitus, osteoporosis, arthritis, balance problems, depression
and cognitive impairment (Raji et al., 2010; Danon-Hersch et al.,
2012; Fernández-Garrido et al., 2014).
Pre-frailty is associated with a number of risk factors, such
as higher hemoglobin A1c, inflammation markers, uric acid and
waist circumference as well as lower vitamin D levels and ankle
brachial index and some alterations in hormone levels (i.e.,
testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] and its sulfate
ester [DHEAS], parathyroid hormone and cortisol) (Cappola
et al., 2009; Shardell et al., 2009; O’Connell et al., 2011b; Smit
et al., 2012; Fernández-Garrido et al., 2014; Johar et al., 2014;
Sergi et al., 2015). Low testosterone levels are independently
associated with pre-frailty and frailty in both elderly men and
women (Wu et al., 2010). In general, women with pre-frailty
and frailty have lower levels of anabolic hormones (testosterone,
DHEAS and insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1]) than their
non-frail counterparts at similar ages—moreover, the absolute
burden of all anabolic hormonal deficiencies better predicts
frailty status than a single hormonal deficiency (Cappola et al.,
2009). The probability of frailty may reveal a U-shaped relation
with women’s free testosterone levels: lower and higher levels
are associated with the chance of being frail in women, whereas
in men, this probability is linearly and inversely related to
testosterone levels. Moreover, obesity modifies the effects of
testosterone on frailty in females but not in males (Carcaillon
et al., 2012).
The accumulation of these subclinical conditions may appear
as pre-frailty states, which, in addition to other comorbidities and
older age, may increase the risk of (particularly) cardiovascular
diseases
(Flint,
2015).
Notably,
pre-frailty
is
particularly
associated with heart failure events, and indeed, heart failure
is the most frequent mode of cardiovascular diseases among
pre-frail and frail people (Newman et al., 2001, 2006; Woods
et al., 2005; Sergi et al., 2015). However, some data suggest
that the reverse scenario between pre-frailty and cardiovascular
illnesses may also be true; clinical and subclinical cardiovascular
disorders may increase the risk of pre-frailty (and frailty),
therefore postulating a bidirectional relation between these
two entities (Newman et al., 2001; Gale et al., 2014; Ricci
et al., 2014; Flint, 2015; Sergi et al., 2015). This bidirectional
causal relationship enables considering the pre-frailty state
and cardiovascular diseases as a vicious cycle in which one
feeds the development of the other (Flint, 2015). Interventions
directed at breaking this vicious cycle should be effective
in the early disease stage, i.e., in patients with pre-frailty or
preclinical cardiovascular illnesses, and management should
focus on both the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors
and the augmentation of overall physiologic reserves (Flint,
2015).
PHYSICAL, NUTRITIONAL AND MEDICAL
INTERVENTIONS ON FRAILTY
With increasing age, the progressive decrease in voluntary
physical activity leads to a higher risk of frailty; regular exercise
should therefore be beneficial to older people who are frail
or at high risk of frailty, i.e., pre-frail (Walston et al., 2006).
The rationale to intervene with physically frail elderly people
comes from the concept that the pathway toward frailty relies
on the mechanism in which sarcopenia (beyond inflammation
and neuroendocrine deregulation) plays a primary role; hence,
physical activity interventions should be a key treatment element
in physical frailty independent of concomitant diseases (Woods
et al., 2005).
Recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis indicate that
exercise interventions improve gait speed and physical function
measured by physical performance scales in frail elderly subjects.
However, the results are inconclusive for endurance outcomes,
and no consistent effect was observed for balance and functional
status. Moreover, many uncertainties exist with regard to which
exercise characteristics (i.e., type, frequency and duration) are
the most effective in elderly populations (Giné-Garriga et al.,
2014; de Labra et al., 2015). Another meta-analysis demonstrated
that compared with the control group, the exercise group
increased their gait speed and balance function and improved
their performance in the activities of daily living; nevertheless,
no significant benefit in the group’s quality of life was observed
(Chou et al., 2012). In their meta-analysis, de Vries et al.
(2012) demonstrated that a physical exercise therapy positively
affects mobility and physical functioning; moreover, high-
intensity exercise interventions appear to be somewhat more
effective in improving physical functioning than low-intensity
exercises. However, the effect on physical activity and quality
of life is not clear, and no ultimate conclusions on the most
efficient type of physical exercise therapy can be reached (de
Vries et al., 2012). In their systematic review, Cadore et al.
(2013) revealed that multicomponent exercise intervention with

Frailty and Pre-frailty Review
balance, strength and endurance training is the best strategy
to decrease the rate of falls and improve gait, balance and
strength in physically frail older individuals. Systematic reviews
by Daniels et al. (2008) and Theou et al. (2011) also provided
arguments that multicomponent exercise training may have the
best positive effect on physical performance; hence, such an
approach should be commonly used for the management of frail
older adults.
Although a multicomponent approach seems to be the
most effective strategy with which to slow the frailty progress,
resistance training appears to be a key element in preventing
sarcopenia and falls, and maintaining functional capacity
(Cadore et al., 2014; Bosaeus and Rothenberg, 2016). Reduced
muscle mass and strength are fundamental components of frailty;
however, aging muscles can positively respond to increased
activity, particularly to resistance exercises (Fiatarone et al.,
1994). This type of training ultimately has the largest effect
on improving and preserving lean muscle mass (Cruz-Jentoft
et al., 2014; Bosaeus and Rothenberg, 2016). Meta-analyses by
Liu and Latham (2009) demonstrated that progressive resistance
training improves physical functioning in older people in the
areas of muscle strength and the performance of certain simple
and complex activities. Although serious adverse events of such
activity are rare, caution should be taken when implementing this
approach with clinical populations at higher risk of injury (Liu
and Latham, 2009).
Despite all of these reports documenting that older adults may
benefit from regular exercise training, more trials are required
to determine the most appropriate exercise programme, i.e., the
type, intensity, frequency and duration of training (Chin A Paw
et al., 2008).
Another primary risk factor for the onset of frailty is
malnutrition, which is indeed quite prevalent in geriatric
populations.
Malnutrition
significantly
influences
the
development of frailty because weight loss leads to weakness,
exhaustion, slow walking speed and low physical activity—
hence, nutritional screening is highly important in frail
individuals (Lilamand et al., 2015; Artaza-Artabe et al., 2016).
Hypoalbuminemia is a marker of malnutrition associated with a
loss of muscle mass and is also a prognostic factor for mortality
in the elderly population (Cabrerizo et al., 2015). A diet with
a high protein content may have a beneficial effect on health,
help in recovery from diseases and maintain functional status in
those persons (Bauer et al., 2013; Volpi et al., 2013). Some studies
suggest that the amount of protein intake in elderly patients,
which is necessary to stimulate protein synthesis, should range
between 1.2 and 1.5 g/kg/day (Gaffney-Stomberg et al., 2009;
Mithal et al., 2013). Indeed, nutritional supplementation for
frail people has been demonstrated to slow their functional
decline,
as
measured
by
the
Short-Physical
Performance
Battery and tests of hand grip strength (Kim and Lee, 2013).
In addition, the combination of resistance exercise and protein
supplementation after exercise may be even more effective in
increasing muscle mass, strength, and physical ability in elderly
people (Artaza-Artabe et al., 2016). Not all studies addressing
dietary interventions, however, provide uniform results: there is
also relatively low adherence to the nutritional treatment over a
long period of time among older people, preventing a consistent
consensus on the effects of nutritional supplementation in frailty
(Artaza-Artabe et al., 2016).
The etiology of sarcopenia in frail people involves multiple
mechanisms, including the age–related decline in the level of
anabolic hormones (Fried et al., 2005; O’Connell et al., 2011b).
In this context, testosterone, the primary androgenic hormone
in men, appears to play a critical role because it has a strong
anabolic influence on skeletal muscle (Bhasin et al., 2005). Studies
have demonstrated that a low bioavailable testosterone level is
associated with frailty not only in men but also, to some extent,
in women (Cawthon et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Carcaillon et al.,
2012). Treatment with testosterone, particularly at higher doses,
may improve body composition and modestly increase muscle
strength in older men (Bhasin et al., 1996; O’Connell and Wu,
2014). Although a response to this type of therapy is not generally
reflected in physical functioning such as gait speed, mobility or
daily living activities, improvement can be observed in muscle
strength, i.e., grip and lower limb strength (O’Connell and Wu,
2014). It is possible that testosterone alone may be relatively
ineffective in ameliorating physical functioning and should
instead be combined with different exercise trainings to create a
broad functional benefit (Bhasin, 2010). An overall improvement
in strength and lean body mass typically appears within 6 months
and lasts for the duration of testosterone treatment (Snyder et al.,
1999; Wittert et al., 2003; Page et al., 2005). Unfortunately, the
majority of these benefits are lost 3–6 months after ending the
therapy (O’Connell et al., 2011a; Sattler et al., 2011). Nevertheless,
a common use of testosterone in older men is restricted by
concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostatic adverse effects
(O’Connell and Wu, 2014). In one of the trials, testosterone
therapy was discontinued because of an excess of cardiovascular
events (Basaria et al., 2010), and the meta–analysis by Calof et al.
(2005) suggested that testosterone treatment doubles the rate of
prostate events. Thus, large-scale, long duration, appropriately
powered clinical studies are necessary to establish the safety of
this type of therapy before it can be approved for the management
of frail, or even pre-frail, older male populations.
IGF-1 is another anabolic hormone that plays a role in the
preservation of muscle mass and strength and may prevent
apoptosis and protect from oxidative stress (Arvat et al., 2000).
Because of these features, IGF-1 may be considered a key
element of nutritional, hormonal and inflammatory hypotheses
of frailty (Maggio et al., 2013). Notably, some minerals, such
as magnesium, selenium, and zinc have some beneficial effects
on IGF-1 levels (i.e., tissue production or liver secretion) and
muscle function, providing hope for a potential improvement
in physical performance among elderly patients (Maggio et al.,
2013). However, the real effectiveness of this and other probable
therapeutic interventions (e.g., antioxidants, anti-inflammatory
agents, nutritional supplements) appears to be limited and thus
far has not been sufficiently explored in detail (Laosa et al., 2014).
Therefore, more clinical data are imperative before proposing
such curative options to frail people.
In this context, a condition that has been more deeply
investigated and may potentially contribute to a sedentary
lifestyle and immobility and therefore to frailty is vitamin

D deficiency. Low levels of 25(OH)D are quite common in
elderly people (particularly those institutionalized) (Visser et al.,
2006) and have been demonstrated to be associated with
balance problems, falls, fractures and pain (Lips, 2001; Zamboni
et al., 2002; Mascarenhas and Mobarhan, 2004; Snijder et al.,
2006). Some convincing clinical data (including meta-analysis
of randomized trials) indicate that vitamin D supplementation
can reduce falls and improve muscle strength and walking
distance in older people (Verhaar et al., 2000; Montero-Odasso
and Duque, 2005; Cameron et al., 2010; Halfon et al., 2015;
Zhou et al., 2016). However, it is somewhat difficult to confirm
the cause-effect association between low 25(OH)D levels and
frailty because frailty may contribute to the development
of vitamin D deficiency because of a reduction in outdoor
activity, facilitating a sedentary lifestyle and therefore reducing
exposure to sunlight (Artaza-Artabe et al., 2016). Hence, future
studies are necessary to establish an optimal serum 25(OH)D
concentration in frail elderly persons and the association between
vitamin D status and various frailty models (Zhou et al.,
2016).
Finally, it should be noted that frailty influences the effects of
therapy for various disorders, particularly invasive management
in cardiovascular diseases (Singh et al., 2014). Because frail
people have a higher risk of complications, conservative or
less invasive strategies are preferred, such as percutaneous
coronary interventions instead of coronary by-pass grafting for
multivessel coronary artery disease (Rumsfeld et al., 1999; Singh
et al., 2008). However, even frail patients benefit from current
drug therapy although the frailest individuals are less likely
to be treated with up-to-date medicines, primarily because of
concerns regarding side effects. In studies addressing statin
therapy, frail elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases treated
with these agents presented a reduced three-year mortality
rate irrespective of age and multidimensional impairment
(Pilotto et al., 2015, 2016b). In addition, older persons
with atrial fibrillation benefit from anticoagulation therapy in
terms of lower all-cause death regardless of their functional
condition.
Nevertheless,
there
are
suggestions
that
some
positive effects of the above treatments may come from
better overall care provided to these patients (Pilotto et al.,
2016a).
AGING IS IN THE MIND—HOW TO
CHANGE THE MIND?
Recently, a concept of “cognitive frailty” has been proposed that is
characterized by the coexistence of physical frailty and cognitive
impairment (Panza et al., 2006; Kelaiditi et al., 2014). Such
an approach is consistent with the multidimensional definition
of frailty in which physical, psychological and social factors
interplay with one another and consequently potentiate their
effects (Figure 1). Cognitive frailty is a heterogeneous clinical
syndrome of cognitive impairment (corresponding to the Clinical
Dementia Rating Scale [CDR] ≤ 0.5) associated with physical
frailty or pre-frailty but independent of dementia resulting from
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or other neurodegenerative conditions
(Kelaiditi et al., 2014; Panza et al., 2015; Ruan et al., 2015).
Two subtypes of cognitive frailty are currently distinguished:
reversible and potentially reversible. Reversible cognitive frailty
is defined as subjective cognitive decline and/or positive fluid
and imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neural injury
(CDR < 0.5) that are unrelated to acute medical events or
clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative and mental conditions.
Potentially reversible cognitive frailty is identified if physically
frail individuals present mild cognitive impairment (CDR = 0.5)
(Kelaiditi et al., 2014; Ruan et al., 2015). By combining self-
reported symptoms, cognitive tests and biomarkers, one may
differentiate (to some extent) cognitive frailty from preclinical
AD and other neurological/psychiatric disorders. For this
purpose, evidence of the accumulation of amyloid-ß and tau
protein within the central nervous system and presence of
ApoE ε4 genotype should be considered. Based on different
combinations of these biomarkers and the decline of mental
function, the cognitive frailty and various preclinical stages of
AD may be recognized (Sperling et al., 2013; Ruan et al., 2015).
There are a number of studies indicating that physical frailty is
a risk factor of cognitive frailty, which in turn is a predictor of
overall dementia, particularly vascular dementia (Giannini et al.,
2015; Montero-Odasso et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2017). However,
precisely how physical frailty or pre-frailty causes cognitive
decline is not known (Kelaiditi et al., 2014; Panza et al., 2015;
Ruan et al., 2015). It has been shown that cognitive frailty not
only predicts dementia but also all-cause mortality among the
elderly in both short- and long-term observations (Solfrizzi et al.,
2017).
Diverse psychological and social factors may contribute to the
development of cognitive impairment. Indeed, aging is associated
with an unavoidable awareness of elapsing time, which constantly
reminds elderly people of the approaching end of life and
significantly affects their psychological state. In addition, a lack of
occupation and loneliness may lead to the loss of motivation and
purpose. Social programmes that meet only basic demands, such
as accommodation and physiological needs, are not sufficient
to motivate older people to participate in regular physical,
intellectual and social activities. Of note, having a purpose
appears to be a key element in encouraging elderly subjects to
activate their abilities. It has been shown that volunteer work
decreases the risk of becoming frail by 27% after 3 years of
follow-up. Providing care for children and paid work may also
be associated with some tendency to reduce frailty, however,
adjusting for age, disability, and cognitive function attenuates
these effects (Jung et al., 2010). An approach integrating a
cognitive-behavioral intervention with a faith-based curriculum
among a highly sedentary population of older African American
women was an effective strategy to increase their physical activity
(measured in steps walked per week), which was additionally
associated with lowering their blood pressure (Duru et al.,
2010). In a large randomized controlled trial, cognitive training
conducted in secular community settings improved cognitive
abilities over 5 years after the beginning of the intervention
(Willis et al., 2006). In another trial, cognitive training designed
to enhance attention and information processing and stimulate
short-term memory, reasoning and problem-solving abilities

Frailty and Pre-frailty Review
significantly decreased frailty. Notably, although the reduction
of frailty in the intervention groups was remarkably higher in
this study, the control group participants also demonstrated some
benefit in terms of diminishing frailty (Ng et al., 2015). The
latter suggests that some positive effects may also be achieved
only from contact with other people (i.e., the study staff in
this case); presumably, providing some attention to and interest
in elderly persons may stimulate them toward a more active
life.
Social interactions and events may play an important role
in keeping life progressing because such circumstances may
involve multiple cognitive, social and physical elements and
consequently ameliorate various domains of human functioning.
One such activity is dancing, which can improve lower body
muscle strength and flexibility, aerobic power, static and dynamic
balance, agility, and gait speed in older adults and may also
enhance lower body bone-mineral content and reduce the
incidence of falls and cardiovascular risks (Keogh et al., 2009).
Cross-sectional studies provide arguments that elderly people
who dance have better balance and gait abilities than aged-
matched controls (Verghese, 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). An
observational study in older Japanese people revealed that
dancing for at least 1year decreased the incidence of falls by 70%
(Okubo et al., 2014). However, a recently published randomized
controlled trial among residents of retirement villages near
Sydney indicated that social dancing programmes did not reduce
falls in older adults or cause any significant improvement in
cognitive risk factors (Merom et al., 2016). An explanation
of these negative results may be that the increase in physical
activity in the dance group most likely increases exposure
to falls, particularly among elderly individuals who previously
experienced such events (Merom et al., 2016). Therefore, a
careful investigation of the potential risk of falls should be
conducted before elderly subjects are cleared for dancing
programmes.
In terms of preventing frailty, the most promising approach
appears
to
be
longitudinal
community-based
strategies
integrating multiple dimensions of human activities. The
10-year community-based intervention to prevent frailty in
Kusatsu (Japan) effectively improved the functional status of
older residents in this area (Shinkai et al., 2016). The project
included physical, nutritional and social aspects and targeted
enhancing human connections and encouraging participants
to continue the group activities after the end of the project.
The annual incidence rate for disability decreased, and active
life expectancy at age 70 was significantly prolonged. The
results of this intervention demonstrate that a community-
based approach is a promising technique for preventing or
postponing the onset of frailty. Moreover, this was the first
study in which regular health check-ups demonstrated having
a positive effect on healthy aging in community-dwelling
elderly people; the check-ups with comprehensive geriatric
assessments were associated with less loss of active life and a
reduction in subsequent mortality (Shinkai et al., 2016). The
authors also stated that many young residents who worked as
survey interviewers became aware of the frailty problem, and
older residents became familiar with the concept of healthy
aging and accordingly improved their lifestyle (Shinkai et al.,
2016).
It appears that broad societies are not aware of frailty as
a health problem and that people generally do not realize
that they may change their unfavorable trajectory to senility.
As populations become older, it is sensible to treat frailty as
other population-affecting disorders and implement appropriate
preventative measures: adequate information appears to be the
first step. Social campaigns should inform societies about age-
related frailty and pre-frailty and should also suggest a proper
lifestyle to avoid or delay these conditions, as societies do with
obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The perception
of senility requires considerable revision in society and among
elderly people themselves. Because we can live longer, it is
reasonable to replace the term “aging” with the term “longer
life”, which more accurately reflects demographic changes in
the upcoming time; such a change in mentality is imperative to
properly prepare communities for greater longevity.
The current approach to elderly subjects is routinely directed
toward ensuring conditions in which the elderly do not need to
keep up with new technologies or lifestyle changes. Although they
may feel safer as a result, this approach encourages a type of
dependency. In this context, the biggest barrier appears to be new
digital technologies that create substantial concern among older
people and prevent them from participating in a full social life. As
yet, no dedicated programme has addressed this problem, and no
systematic approach has been proposed to make elderly persons
more self-confident and more familiar with these challenges.
Properly devoted studies should address the question of whether
such an approach may increase the social and individual activities
of elderly people and reduce the prevalence of frailty in the
future.
CONCLUSIONS
Early detection of any form of functional degradation in
elderly subjects is critical for timely intervention to preserve
their biological, psychological and social status. Pre-frailty and
frailty are preclinical states, and thus diagnostic instruments
should have high potential to capture these conditions in
their initial phases to identify persons who may benefit
from preventive treatment. Although regular exercise training
appears to be the basis for managing pre-frail and frail
people, more high-quality trials are needed to determine the
most appropriate type of training in older adults. Periodic
monitoring of food intake and body weight is essential in
elderly people; however, determining the real effectiveness of
nutritional supplementations and other probable therapeutic
interventions, such as treatment with vitamin D, androgen,
antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory agents, requires further
investigation to establish their optimal combination and most
effective duration. Finally, frailty should be viewed as a
population-affecting disease; therefore, a public approach with
proper informative strategies regarding frailty itself and concepts
of healthy aging should be a key element of global frailty
prevention.
