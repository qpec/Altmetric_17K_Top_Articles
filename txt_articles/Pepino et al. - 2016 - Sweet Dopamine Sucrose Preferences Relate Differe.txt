Sweet Dopamine: Sucrose Preferences
Relate Differentially to Striatal D2
Receptor Binding and Age in Obesity
Diabetes 2016;65:2618–2623 | DOI: 10.2337/db16-0407
Alterations in dopaminergic circuitry play a critical role
in food reward and may contribute to susceptibility to
obesity. Ingestion of sweets releases dopamine in stria-
tum, and both sweet preferences and striatal D2 recep-
tors (D2R) decline with age and may be altered in obesity.
Understanding the relationships between these variables
and the impact of obesity on these relationships may re-
veal insight into the neurobiological basis of sweet pref-
erences. We evaluated sucrose preferences, perception
of sweetness intensity, and striatal D2R binding potential
(D2R BPND) using positron emission tomography with a
D2R-selective radioligand insensitive to endogenous do-
pamine, (N-[11C] methyl)benperidol, in 20 subjects with-
out obesity (BMI 22.5 6 2.4 kg/m2; age 28.3 6 5.4 years)
and 24 subjects with obesity (BMI 40.3 6 5.0 kg/m2; age
31.2 6 6.3 years). The groups had similar sucrose prefer-
ences, sweetness intensity perception, striatal D2R BPND,
and age-related D2R BPND declines. However, both stria-
tal D2R BPND and age correlated with sucrose prefer-
ences in subjects without obesity, explaining 52% of
their variance in sucrose preference. In contrast, these
associations were absent in the obese group. In conclu-
sion, the age-related decline in D2R was not linked to
the age-related decline in sweetness preferences, sug-
gesting that other, as-yet-unknown mechanisms play a
role and that these mechanisms are disrupted in obesity.
Obesity is caused by ingesting more energy than expended
over a long period of time. However, the mechanisms
involved in regulating food intake are complex and not
completely understood. A growing body of evidence sug-
gests that neural circuits involved in reward and motiva-
tion pathways, typically studied in the context of addiction,
interact with classic homeostatic regulatory brain areas to
cause hedonic hyperphagia and contribute to the develop-
ment of obesity (1). Data from several studies that involved
blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) functional MRI have
shown that food consumption elicits a smaller BOLD re-
sponse in the dorsal striatum in subjects with obesity than
those who are lean (2,3), presumably mediated by reduced
striatal dopaminergic functioning.
The dopamine system plays a critical role in mediating
the rewarding effects of food ingestion and thereby influ-
ences ingestive behavior. For example, dopamine-deficient
rodents stop eating and die of starvation, but these animals
can be rescued by restoring dopamine signaling either
systemically (4) or within the dorsal, but not ventral, stria-
tum (5). The evolutionarily conserved organization of the
striatum serves, in part, to differentially encode and regu-
late the hedonic value of simply tasting sweetness in the
ventral striatum and the postingestive rewarding effects of
sugar in the dorsal striatum (6).
A heightened preference for intense sweetness is
innate and a hallmark of youth (7). From late adolescence
to adulthood, however, sweetness preference declines in
both rodents (8) and people (7,9–11). In addition, data
from studies conducted in rodent models demonstrate

OBESITY STUDIES
 that the decline in sweetness preference is attenuated by
obesity (8). The mechanisms responsible for the age-
related decline in sweetness preference and the alteration
in sweetness preference associated with obesity are not
known (12). The main purpose of this study was to test
the hypothesis that the age-related decline in sweet pref-
erences is directly related to the age-related decline in
striatal D2 receptors (D2R) and that this relationship is
altered in people with obesity.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants
Twenty-four subjects with obesity (BMI $30.0 kg/m2)
and 20 subjects without obesity (BMI ,26.0 kg/m2) be-
tween the ages of 18 and 40 years old (Table 1) provided
written informed consent and participated in this study,
which was approved by the institutional review board of
the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
Selected data from these subjects have been reported
previously (13–15). Potential subjects completed a com-
prehensive medical evaluation that included an oral glu-
cose tolerance test (OGTT); those who had diabetes,
smoked tobacco, were taking medications that affect do-
pamine function, had an IQ ,80, or had neurological con-
ditions including parkinsonism, lifetime psychosis, mania,
substance dependence, major depression, social phobia, or
eating disorders and panic disorders determined by neuro-
logical examination and psychiatric interview were excluded.
Taste Testing
The following tests were performed ;1 h after subjects
completed the OGTT and consumed a standardized light
snack.
Sucrose Intensity Perception
To ensure differences in preferences were not confounded
by differences in perception of stimuli strength, we deter-
mined subjects’ perception of sweet taste intensity across a
range of sucrose concentrations by using the general label
magnitude scale (16), as previously described (17).
Sucrose Preferences
To determine the subjects’ most preferred intensity of
sweetness, we used the Monell two-series, forced-choice
tracking procedure (11). Subjects were presented with
pairs of solutions that differed in sucrose concentration
(3%–36% w/v), and preferences were determined as pre-
viously described (11,17).
Positron Emission Tomography and MRI Acquisition
and Analyses
On a separate visit, an average of 13.9 days (SD 17.1)
after taste testing, subjects underwent functional MRI and
2-h positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Methods
for (N-[11C] methyl)benperidol ([11C]NMB) synthesis, MRI,
and PET scan acquisitions and preprocessing were de-
scribed previously (13,14). Each participant received an
intravenous infusion of a D2R-selective radioligand not
sensitive to endogenous dopamine, [11C]NMB (6.4–18.1
mCi) over 20 s. [11C]NMB purity was $96% and specific
activity was $1,066 Ci/mmol (39 TBq/mmol). PET scans
were done with the Siemens/CTI ECAT EXACT HR+ tomo-
graph (18). Emission data were collected in 3D mode for 2 h
with a total of 30 frames: 3 3 1 min, 4 3 2 min, 3 3 3 min,
and 20 3 5 min. Transaxial and axial spatial resolution at
slice center are 4.3 mm and 4.1 mm full width at half
maximum in 3D mode.
The methods for our region of interest–based analyses
are described previously (13,14). We used FreeSurfer for
segmentation of striatal regions (19). To limit multiple
comparisons, we averaged D2R specific binding (nondis-
placeable binding potential [BPND]) across left and right
hemispheres for each region of interest. Putamen and
caudate D2R BPND values were averaged to obtain a com-
posite dorsal striatal BPND, and nucleus accumbens D2R
BPND was used to determine ventral striatal BPND. The
midbrain region of each individual’s magnetization-pre-
pared rapid gradient-echo was traced as previously de-
scribed (13).
Statistical Analyses
The statistical significance of values between groups was
evaluated by using Pearson’s x2 or unpaired t test as
appropriate, and differences in sweetness intensity per-
ception between groups was evaluated by using a mixed
ANOVA. We used separate linear regression models for
dorsal and ventral striatum to analyze the ability of age
and D2R BPND to predict sucrose preferences. Age 3
group and D2R BPND 3 group interactions were included
in the model to test the hypothesis that group affected
the strength of relationships between main factors.
Analyses were repeated using race and sex as covariates

RESULTS
Subject Characteristics
Subjects with and without obesity did not significantly
differ in age, height, years of education, sex, or race
distribution, but subjects with obesity had higher plasma
glucose and insulin concentrations and were more insulin
resistant, as indicated by the HOMA of insulin resistance
score. As previously reported (15), both groups had similar
striatal BPND (Table 1). With the exception of two partic-
ipants who were overweight (BMI 25.9 and 25.1 kg/m2), all
other subjects in the group without obesity were normal
weight (BMI 18.6–24.6 kg/m2). Two of the 24 subjects with
obesity were excluded from the analyses because their su-
crose preferences testing was unreliable, and one subject
without obesity was excluded because his sucrose prefer-
ence was more than 2 SD above the group mean and his
sweetness perception was markedly blunted.
Sweet Taste Testing
Sucrose preferences (P = 0.41) (Fig. 1A) and perception of
sweetness intensity were similar between groups (group 3
sucrose concentration interaction P = 0.37) (Fig. 1B).
Relationships Among Age, Central D2Rs, and Sucrose
Preferences
Consistent with our previous finding in a subset of these
subjects (13), there was an age-related decline in dorsal
(r = 20.42; P , 0.01), but not ventral (r = 20.23; P =
0.14), D2R BPND in both groups. However, the relation-
ship between age, striatal D2R BPND, and sucrose prefer-
ences were markedly different in groups with and without
obesity (model for dorsal striatum: R2 = 0.32, F4,36 = 4.32,
P , 0.01; both interactions: dorsal D2R BPND 3 group
and age 3 group had a P # 0.01) (model for ventral
striatum: R2 = 0.28; F4,36 = 3.53; P = 0.02; ventral D2R
BPND 3 group interaction had a P = 0.03; age 3 group
interaction had a P = 0.06). There was a negative linear
relationship between age and sucrose preferences and be-
tween both dorsal and ventral D2R BPND and sucrose
preferences in subjects without obesity; age and dorsal
striatal D2R BPND accounted for 52% (Fig. 2A and B)
and age and ventral striatal D2R BPND accounted for
40% (Fig. 3A and B) of the individual differences in su-
crose preferences. These associations remained significant
when controlling for race and sex in a hierarchical regres-
sion model. In contrast, there were no significant relation-
ships between age and sucrose preferences (Figs. 2C and
3C) or between D2R BPND and sucrose preferences (Figs.
2D and 3D) in subjects with obesity.
DISCUSSION
The primary findings of this study are that subjects with
obesity lack the normal associations between age and
sucrose preferences and between striatal D2R BPND and
sucrose preferences. Additionally, age-related decline in
D2R BPND is not directly related to the age-related decline
in sucrose preferences. Instead, lower sucrose preference
in subjects without obesity related both to increased stria-
tal D2R BPND and older age, explaining up to 52% of indi-
vidual variance in sucrose preference.
Our findings in subjects without obesity contribute to
the understanding of the important role of dopamine on
feeding behavior and food reward (20,21). Previous neu-
roimaging studies in healthy lean people report that do-
pamine release in dorsal striatum correlates positively
with subjective ratings of wanting a food (20) or pleasure
experienced from eating a favorite food (21). Here we
found that lower striatal D2R BPND relates to preferences
for more intense sweetness, which supports observations
that patients with Parkinson disease, a neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by striatal presynaptic dopamine
Figure 1—Sucrose preferences (A) and perceived sweetness of increasing sucrose concentrations (0%, 3%, 12%, and 36% w/v) (B) do not
differ between subjects without and with obesity. Both groups similarly perceived progressively increasing sweetness intensity with
increasing sucrose concentrations (P < 0.0001). Data are presented as geometric mean 6 geometric SE for sucrose preferences and

 deficiency, exhibit greater liking for higher sucrose con-
centrations (22) and correlates with data from rodent
models that show that treatment with dopamine receptor
antagonists cause a shift in sweet preferences toward
more concentrated sucrose solutions (23). By contrast,
sucrose preference did not relate to striatal D2R BPND
in subjects with obesity. The mechanism underlying
this lack of association in subjects with obesity is un-
known. Our data suggest one more type of dopaminergic
disruption associated with obesity. However, whether
this dopaminergic disruption truly relates to having a
BMI .30 kg/m2 or to other characteristics that may be
clustered with obesity, such as having a specific type of
diet (e.g., high-fat diet) or markers of metabolic syn-
drome (e.g., insulin resistance or hyperleptinemia), is
unknown.
Several research studies tried to determine whether
subjects with obesity respond to sweetness differently
from subjects without obesity, with conflicting results
(16). The disruption in subjects with obesity of the well-
known age-related decline in sucrose preference suggests
that age could be an important factor contributing to in-
consistency in the literature of sweetness preferences in
obesity. That is, differences may be negligible when sucrose
preferences are measured in young adulthood, as we found,
but may become more apparent in older populations. The
age consideration may also apply to D2R differences; how-
ever, in this same population, we reported no D2R differ-
ences between groups with and without obesity (13).
Our findings in subjects without obesity support the
known age-related decline in sweet preferences (7,9,11)
but do not help explain the mechanism(s) underlying such
a developmental shift. A previous study in 11- to 15-year-
old children found that preferences for high versus low
sucrose concentrations related to differential amounts
of a biomarker of bone growth in urine, suggesting that
biochemical changes controlling linear growth mediate
developmental changes in sugar preferences (10). The
Figure 2—Preferences for higher sucrose concentrations were related to younger age (A) and lower dorsal striatal D2R BPND (B) in subjects
without obesity (open symbols). Together, age and dorsal striatal D2R BPND accounted for 52% of the individual differences in sucrose
preferences. In contrast, sucrose preferences did not associate with age (C) or with dorsal striatal D2R BPND (D) in subjects with obesity
(closed symbols). Data points are standardized residuals of partial correlations after controlling for D2R BPND in panels A and C and after

 strong negative association between age and sucrose pref-
erence found in our nonobese subjects, who were between
20 and 40 years old and have presumably completed their
linear growth, suggests that some other, as-yet-unknown
mechanism contributes to age-related changes in su-
crose preferences and that this mechanism is disrupted
in obesity.
Our study has several important limitations. It is
possible that our results were influenced by differences
in race between groups and by the majority of women
in both groups, as people of African American descent
generally prefer higher concentrations of sucrose than
people of Caucasian descent (9) and there could be sex-
related variations in taste perception (24). However, the
statistical significance of the relationships between any of
our outcome measures do not change when using statis-
tical analyses that control for race and sex. Therefore, it is
unlikely that race or sex significantly influenced our con-
clusions. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility
that gonadal hormone–related variations in taste perception
(24) affected our results because we did not measure plasma
hormone concentrations and did not control for the men-
strual cycle phase. Finally, these results will require replica-
tion because of the novel nature of our findings and the
small sample on which they are based.
In summary, both striatal D2R BPND and age are neg-
atively correlated with sucrose preferences in subjects
without obesity, but these associations are absent in sub-
jects with obesity. Our data suggest that the age-related
decline in D2R is not directly linked to the age-related
decline in sweetness preferences, suggesting that other,
as-yet-unknown mechanisms are involved and that these
mechanisms are disrupted in obesity.
