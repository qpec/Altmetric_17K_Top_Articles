Abstract
Purpose—Data suggest that lesbian and bisexual adolescents engage in risky sexual behaviors at 
higher rates than heterosexual girls. Whether these findings also apply to girls of other sexual 
identities is less well understood. Potential differences in risky sexual behaviors reported by 
lesbian versus bisexual adolescents are also underreported in the literature.
Methods—Data were collected online in 2010–2011 among 2,823 girls, aged 13 to 18 years, in 
the U.S. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify comparisons of sexual behaviors 
between (1) lesbian, (2) bisexual, and (3) questioning, unsure, or other (QUO) identity and (0) 
heterosexual girls. Logistic regression compared lesbian and bisexual adolescents.
Results—Lesbian and bisexual adolescents reported significantly more lifetime and past-year 
sexual partners than heterosexual girls. Bisexual girls were also more likely to report penile-anal 
and penile-vaginal sex, whereas lesbians were more likely to report earlier sexual debut for almost 
all types of sex, as compared to heterosexual girls. Lesbians also were more likely to report 
infrequent condom use and less likely to have conversations with partners about the use of barriers 
(e.g., dental dams) before first sex. Relative to lesbians, bisexual girls reported older age at first 
sex for almost all sexual behaviors and higher lifetime prevalence of recent male partners, penile-
vaginal, and penile-anal sex. Few differences were noted between QUO and heterosexual girls.

 Conclusions—Sexual minority adolescents are not identical in terms of sexual risk. Providers 
need to be sensitive to these differences and their implications for health and counseling of 
patients.

minority
Regional studies in the United States (U.S.) consistently find that sexual minority 
adolescents (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual [LGB], and others who do not identify as completely 
heterosexual) engage in sexual risk behaviors at higher rates than heterosexual girls: LGB 
adolescents are more likely to have unprotected penile-vaginal sex,1–4 multiple sexual 
partners,1,3–6 and sexual partners with high risk for human immunodeficiency virus or other 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including intravenous drug users and gay men.7,8 For 
example, in an analysis of data from the Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey 
(YRBS), Goodenow and colleagues found that half of the lesbian and gay girls in the survey 
had both male and female partners, while one in five had only male partners.3 Using YRBS 
data from all states and localities with available data on sexual orientation, Rosario and 
colleagues found that lesbian and bisexual girls were four times more likely to report 
multiple sexual partners in the past 3 months, 60% more likely not to have used condoms 
during last sexual intercourse, and nearly twice as likely to use drugs or alcohol during last 
intercourse than heterosexual girls.6 Moreover, these adolescents initiated sex at younger 
ages than their heterosexual peers.6,8 Reflective of these elevated risk behaviors, LGB girls 
have higher rates of pregnancy3,4,9–11 and STIs12,13 compared to heterosexual girls.
While these statistics are concerning, whether they apply equally to all sexual minority girls 
when compared with heterosexual girls, and whether differences exist between lesbian and 
bisexual adolescents is unclear. In addition, detailed information about risky non-penile-
vaginal sex behaviors, such as anal sex, is lacking. Given the normative sexual development 
and exploration that occur during adolescence,14 this study aims to contribute to a more 
nuanced and detailed understanding of the sexual experiences of sexual minority 
adolescents. Findings have important implications for scientific understanding, preventive 
interventions, and clinical practice supporting healthy adolescent development.
Methods
Data are from the Teen Health and Technology study, an online, national survey of LGB and 
transgender (LGBT) and non-LGBT adolescents, 13–18 years of age, in the U.S. The 
protocol was reviewed and approved by the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (IRB), 
the University of New Hampshire IRB, and the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network 
(GLSEN) Research Ethics Review Committee. Minors provided informed assent and 18-
year-olds consent. The IRBs granted a waiver of parental permission to protect participants 
who could be potentially harmed if their sexual identity was disclosed to their caregivers.

 Participants and Procedures
Participants were recruited: (a) randomly from the Harris Poll Online (HPOL) opt-in panel 
or (b) through national outreach by GLSEN, a non-profit research and advocacy 
organization focused on ensuring safe schools for all students, including LGB youth. 
GLSEN efforts included emails to thousands of high school students who had either 
participated in GLSEN programs previously or had signed up to receive information about 
GLSEN programs and resources.
The survey questionnaire was self-administered online between August 2010 and January 
2011. The median survey length was 23 minutes for HPOL respondents and 34 minutes for 
GLSEN respondents. The survey was longer for GLSEN participants because of additional 
LGB-specific questions.
The response rate for the HPOL sample, 7.2%, is comparable with recent surveys.15,16 The 
response rate for the GLSEN sample could not be calculated given the denominator (i.e., the 
number of youth who saw the email invitation) is unknown.
Measures
Sexual identity was assessed by asking, “How would you describe your sexuality or sexual 
orientation? Please select all that apply.” Response options were: gay, lesbian, bisexual, 
straight/heterosexual, questioning, queer, other, or not sure. Seventeen percent endorsed two 
or more identities. Consistent with previous studies,17,18 responses were categorized based 
on a hierarchy of preference on the homo-affiliative continuum in this order: lesbian/gay, 
bisexual, queer, questioning, unsure, other, and straight/heterosexual. For example, if an 
individual identified as “gay” and “queer,” she was categorized as “lesbian/gay;” if 
“bisexual” and “questioning,” she was categorized as “bisexual.” Five categories resulted: 
straight/heterosexual exclusively (i.e., no additional orientation was marked); bisexual; 
lesbian/gay; queer; and, questioning, unsure, and other (QUO). The 87 girls who endorsed 
both queer and lesbian categories were included in the lesbian group; 31 who identified as 
both queer and bisexual were included in the bisexual group. Because the remaining 13 
youth endorsed a specific identity (i.e., queer), rather than more vague identities such as 
unsure or questioning, we believed combining them with the QUO group would be 
inappropriate. Please note that in previous publications,19 queer youth were instead grouped 
with lesbian/gay youth.
Four lifetime sexual behaviors were queried: oral sex, sex that involved a finger or sex toy 
going into the vagina or anus, penile-vaginal sex, and penile-anal sex. All referred to 
consensual sex by means of “when you wanted to.”
Due to space limitations, details about additional measures are available upon request. The 
survey can be downloaded online.20
Weighting and Data Analysis
Data were weighted to approximate the national population of adolescents in the U.S. and to 
validly combine the two samples as follows: The HPOL general population sample was 
weighted to the known demographics of 13- to 18-year-old youth.21 Next, a demographic

 profile was created for GLSEN youth based on the 5% of HPOL youth who self-identified 
as LGB. Even with the demographic weight applied, the GLSEN youth differed from the 
HPOL youth on nine characteristics (e.g., being out to one’s parents). As such, a second 
weight was applied to adjust for these behavioral and attitudinal differences between the two 
samples. Additional detail has been published elsewhere.22
Given the focus of the current study, the sample was restricted to cisgender girls (i.e., those 
who identified both their sex assigned at birth and their gender as female). Of the 3,385 
respondents who indicated their sex was “female,” 110 were dropped because they did not 
meet valid data requirements (e.g., responded “do not know” to more than 20% of the main 
questions). An additional 120 were excluded because they had extreme weights. Another 
332 were trimmed because they did not choose “female” as their gender. This resulted in a 
final analytical sample size of 2,823 (2,102 recruited through HPOL and 721 through 
GLSEN).
Missing data were imputed using Stata’s “impute” command23 for all variables except the 
principle outcomes (i.e., ever having had oral sex, vaginal or anal sex with a sex toy or 
finger, penile-vaginal sex, or penile-anal sex). Imputed values were estimated in a best-set 
regression. In most cases, less than 8% of the values of a variable were imputed. Exceptions 
were age at first penile-vaginal sex (8.5%) and age at first penile-anal sex (12.2%).
Differences across sexual identities were examined using multinomial logistic regression, 
comparing multiple categories to a reference group: (1) lesbian, (2) bisexual, (3) queer, and 
(4) QUO to (0) heterosexual youth. Logistic regression was used to compare lesbian and 
bisexual girls. Estimates were adjusted for survey process variables (i.e., self-reported 
dishonesty in completing the survey and whether respondent completed the survey alone or 
with other people in the room) and demographic characteristics that significantly varied by 
sexual identity. Per Stata’s reporting protocol, sample sizes are unweighted data while point 
estimates (e.g., odds ratios) are weighted.
Results
The majority of participants identified as heterosexual (65%, n = 1,842; note: all percentages 
in this paragraph are unweighted). Reflective of the recruitment strategy to oversample 
sexual minority youth, over a third identified as lesbian (13%, n = 364), bisexual (16%, n = 
456), queer (0.5%, n = 13), and QUO (5%, n = 148; numbers sum over 100% due to 
rounding).
Demographic characteristics were mostly similar across sexual identities (Table 1; note: all 
percentages forward in the Results section reflect weighted percentages). Minor differences 
were noted for race and income (i.e., one of the three LGB identity groups differed from 
heterosexual girls). Age and being born-again Christian were significantly different for both 
lesbian and bisexual adolescents when compared to heterosexual girls. Due to the low 
sample size (n = 13), queer youth were not included in subsequent analyses.

 Lifetime Sexual Behavior, Age at First Sex, and Lifetime and Recent Sexual Partners
As shown in Table 2, lesbians reported elevated lifetime prevalence rates of low STI risk 
behaviors (e.g., sex with a finger or sex toy) and were less likely to have engaged in penile-
anal sex than heterosexual girls, even after adjusting for underlying differences in 
demographic characteristics. However, they were just as likely to have ever engaged in 
penile-vaginal sex and were significantly younger, on average, at first sex than their 
heterosexual peers. Among those who had ever had sex, lesbians also reported significantly 
more lifetime and past-year sexual partners than demographically similar heterosexual girls.
Bisexual adolescents reported significantly higher lifetime prevalence rates of all sexual 
behaviors, as well as more lifetime and past-year sexual partners compared to heterosexual 
girls. Few significant differences were found between QUO and heterosexual girls.
Comparisons of lesbian and bisexual adolescents indicated that bisexual girls were 
significantly more likely to have ever had penile-vaginal and penile-anal sex. On the other 
hand, lesbians initiated sexual behaviors at younger ages on average, including penile-
vaginal sex.
Characteristics of Most Recent Sexual Partner
As shown in Table 3, lesbians were significantly more likely than demographically similar 
heterosexual peers to report that the gender of their most recent sexual partner was female 
and that they engaged in vaginal penetration with a finger or sex toy with this partner. 
Lesbians were less likely to report that their most recent partner was male or to have 
engaged in penile-vaginal or penile-anal sex with the most recent partner than heterosexual 
peers. Nevertheless, 22% of lesbians reported a recent male partner. Furthermore, lesbians 
were more than six times as likely to report infrequent condom use and 80% less likely to 
have discussed the use of barriers before first sex than heterosexual girls, adjusting for 
underlying differences in demographic characteristics.
Like lesbians, bisexual girls, relative to heterosexual girls, were more likely to report that the 
gender of their most recent sexual partner was female and with whom they engaged in 
vaginal penetration with a finger or sex toy. Although significantly less than heterosexual 
girls, 81% of bisexual girls said their most recent sexual partner was male.
As shown in Table 3, QUO and heterosexual peers did not differ significantly in almost all 
measures related to their most recent sexual partners.
Compared to lesbians, bisexual girls were more likely to report a male partner, less likely to 
report a female partner, and more likely to engage in penile-vaginal and penile-anal sex. 
They were also more likely to discuss barrier usage with their most recent sexual partner 
before they had sex for the first time and less likely to report inconsistent condom use.
Discussion
In this large national study detailing the sexual behaviors of lesbian, bisexual, QUO, and 
heterosexually-identified girls aged 13 to 18 years old, findings indicate that sexual

 behaviors and experiences vary by sexual identity. Lesbian and bisexual adolescents both 
report more lifetime and past-year sexual partners than heterosexual girls. Similar to 
previous literature,3,24 one in five lesbians’ most recent sexual partner was male, as is true 
for four in five bisexual girls. As perhaps might be expected given this difference, bisexual 
girls are more likely than lesbians to report that they engaged in penile-vaginal and/or 
penile-anal sex with their most recent sexual partner. Bisexual girls are also more likely than 
lesbians to ever have engaged in penile-anal and penile-vaginal sex. Based on the STI risk 
associated with these behaviors, the data suggest sexual minority youth are not a 
homogeneous group with respect to their sexual risk. This is the first study, as far as we 
know, to document this risk differential and, therefore, highlight these differences by sexual 
identity among sexual minority adolescents.
Lesbians are less likely than bisexual or heterosexual girls to report consistent condom use 
during sex involving a penis and less likely to talk with their partner about barrier use before 
their first sexual episode. Perhaps this is because lesbians are less likely to believe that they 
are at risk for STIs when having sex.7,25–27 Although lesbians are less likely to report their 
most recent sexual partner was male (e.g., 17% reported ever having penile-vaginal sex), 
their reported lack of consistent condom use during recent penile-vaginal or penile-anal sex 
potentially increases their risk for STI, however. Healthy sexuality and STI prevention 
programming are needed that teach lesbian girls condom negotiation skills, while also 
acknowledging the complex pressures and motivations when deciding to have sex.
Both bisexual and lesbian adolescents report elevated rates of risk behavior relative to 
heterosexual girls in other important dimensions. For example, lesbians appear to initiate 
penile-vaginal sex at earlier ages than heterosexual girls (13.8 vs. 15.5 years, on average, 
respectively). Bisexual girls are three times more likely to ever have engaged in penile-
vaginal sex and four times more likely to have ever engaged in penile-anal sex than 
heterosexual girls. A number of possible reasons may account for these differences: Sexual 
minority adolescents may feel internal motivation to confirm the validity of their same-sex 
identities by engaging in heterosexual activity. They may also or alternatively experience 
social pressure to adhere to the heterosexual script, to “prove” their heterosexuality, or to 
hide their same-sex attractions from those around them.4,28 Both lesbian and bisexual girls 
may experience or recognize their sexual attractions earlier than heterosexual girls do, in 
which case, sexual desire might be another explanation. Although speculative, internal 
motivation or desire may be particularly strong for lesbian adolescents, who may therefore 
have a harder time dismissing or being distracted from their same-sex attractions. This may 
explain why they are younger than both bisexual and heterosexual girls when initiating 
sexual activity. On the other hand, rates of penile-vaginal and penile-anal sex may be higher 
for bisexual adolescents compared to lesbian and heterosexual girls because, perhaps, they 
feel greater social pressure to have sex with men, or feel greater sexual pleasure when 
having sex with men. Unfortunately, the current data are unable to support or refute these 
hypotheses. More research is needed to contextualize these observed differences in sexual 
risk behaviors between sexual minority and heterosexual girls, as well as between lesbian 
and bisexual adolescents.

 It is critical to note that adolescence is an important time of self-exploration, including with 
sexual identity.29–33 As suggested above, when girls recognize their same-sex attractions, 
they may engage in sexual experimentation as a way of exploring and confirming their 
same-sex feelings and identity. This experimentation may also be an attempt to hide a 
stigmatized identity while dissimulating a more socially acceptable sexual identity to others. 
Understanding and accepting one’s attractions to girls can be difficult in a society that 
stigmatizes same-sex activity and reinforces other-sex activity. Health providers need to be 
aware that sexual experimentation can mean many things, both positive and negative to 
youth. Regardless, it can be a gateway to an important conversation about healthy sexuality.
Although outside the scope of the current study’s focus on consensual sexual experiences, 
another potential explanation for the elevated risk behaviors noted for bisexuals and lesbians 
could be previous experiences with nonconsensual sex and other forms of sexual 
victimization. These types of experiences are elevated among lesbian and bisexuals girls 
compared to heterosexual girls and are strongly linked to earlier and riskier subsequent 
consensual sexual behaviors.1,3,4,34 Sexual abuse is also associated with difficulties 
negotiating safer sexual practices, including condom use.35,36 Research has shown that some 
of the increased sexual risk noted for sexual-minority youth can be explained by a history of 
sexual abuse.1,3,4 It is thus possible that findings in the current study could also be explained 
in part by concomitant risk of nonconsensual sex for bisexual and lesbian adolescents.1,34 In 
addition, lack of access to LGB-relevant resources and services could explain these elevated 
risk behaviors.
Rates of sexual behaviors for QUO girls are similar to those of heterosexual girls. This may 
be because QUO youth are still considering their sexual attractions and resulting identity and 
therefore are not yet acting on their attractions. Interestingly, Ott and colleagues found that 
two-thirds of youth who identified as QUO in adolescence ultimately identified as 
heterosexual in emerging adulthood.37 Our data are consistent with this finding. It is 
nonetheless important to track the sexual identity development of QUO youth and not 
prematurely determine what it may be.
It bears noting that “queer” may be an emerging identity label that lacks consensus among 
youth and researchers about what it reflects. Little is known about this group for many 
reasons, including their frequent exclusion in analyses or inclusion with other groups (e.g., 
gay and lesbian youth). Qualitative research would be helpful in exploring its meaning 
among those who adopt it.
Limitations
In addition to the limitations noted above, measurement concerns exist. Discussion about 
barrier use was measured holistically, rather than separately asking about condoms, dental 
dams, and other barrier devices. It is possible that having a conversation with a male partner 
about using a condom is qualitatively different than with a female partner about using a 
dental dam or condom on a sex toy. Unfortunately, we lack such data. Lack of condom use 
with sex toys and the sharing of sex toys during sex are associated with STI risk,38–40 but 
these behaviors were not queried. Additionally, we lack data on other contraception use.

 Moreover, sexual identity is but one aspect of sexual orientation,6,29–31 and one that may be 
fluid or changeable during adolescence when youth may be exploring their unfolding sexual 
orientation. That is, an adolescent who labels herself lesbian or bisexual or heterosexual at 
one point in time may change her self-identity at a later point in time. Attraction is another, 
perhaps more inclusive, measure of sexual orientation that should be investigated further in 
future studies.29,30,41,42
We also lack sufficient sample size to examine sexual risk behaviors by gender of partners 
and the possible important nuances between them. However, findings that relate to penile-
vaginal and penile-anal sex implicitly account for partner’s sex in the measure and, thus, 
would likely be unchanged by integrating this analytical nuance. Importantly, too, findings 
are cross-sectional and therefore cannot speak to causality.
Recruiting truly nationally representative samples is increasingly difficult.15 These 
difficulties are magnified when recruiting youth for studies that involve sensitive topics. 
Although comparable to other surveys,15,16 our response rate is lower than desired. 
Furthermore, underlying factors related to self-selection in the online panel may have 
affected the sample’s generalizability. For example, it is possible that panel members may 
be more digitally literate than non-members or that GLSEN youth are more publicly out 
than HPOL sexual minority youth. To address this limitation and to minimize self-selection 
bias, HPOL participants were randomly recruited from the panel. The study description was 
purposefully vague so as not to attract youth with specific experiences. Moreover, these 
potential underlying differences were adjusted in the weighting.43,44
Additionally, to reflect the complexity of sexual identity, participants were able to choose as 
many identities as they wanted. These responses were subsequently coded into discrete 
categories for analysis. Findings might possibly have been different if instead youth were 
asked to choose one identity with which they identified strongest. Finally, as with all 
analyses, it is possible that important confounders were not included in the analyses that 
otherwise might have changed the results.
Implications
Findings have implications for health and, thus, for research, service delivery, and 
surveillance as well. The sexual identity of girls who test positive for STIs is often assumed 
to be heterosexual,2 whether true or not. This likely underestimates the true STI risk for 
sexual minority girls, thereby contributing to a widely held perception among health 
professionals that lesbians, most particularly, are not at risk for STIs.3 Health professionals 
should be mindful of this assumption and the need to counter the current state of human 
immunodeficiency virus/STI prevention programming for adolescents, which is entirely 
heterosexually focused.45 To be appealing to sexual-minority young girls, healthy sexuality 
content must provide identity-inclusive content in order to engage this vulnerable population 
and affect behavior in a meaningful and long-lasting way.

 Conclusion
Health researchers, professionals, and others working with youth need to be aware that 
sexual minority adolescents differ in risky sexual behaviors by sexual identity. For example, 
lesbian youth may be initiating sex earlier and engaging in sexual behaviors that elevate 
their risk for STIs compared with heterosexual youth. Bisexual girls are more likely to have 
sex involving a penis as well as to report inconsistent condom use. Evidence of early sexual 
initiation might necessitate a conversation with the young person to better understand her 
reasons and motivations. This conversation should be approached in an open manner 
without a priori assumptions about her sexual identity, even if a history of specific types of 
sex and sex of partner are known. Such discussion might result, if indicated, in an 
opportunity to provide concrete recommendations for use of contraceptives and condoms, as 
well as a more general discussion of healthy sexuality. The health of sexual minority youth, 
both in the near and distant future, may depend on understanding their risk behaviors and 
engaging them in health promotion efforts that acknowledge and are respectful of their 
unique lived experiences.

 Implications and Contributions
Adolescents vary in their sexual risk. Lesbian and bisexual girls report risky sexual 
behaviors, but the patterns differ. Girls who were questioning their identity report 
behaviors similar to heterosexual girls. Health promotion programs that acknowledge and 
respect the unique lived experiences of sexual minority adolescent girls are critically 
needed.

Sample sizes are based on unweighted data. Percentages and means are weighted data and unadjusted. Multinomial logistic regression compares (1) lesbian, (2) bisexual, and (3) QUO (i.e., questioning, 
unsure, or other) to heterosexual. Logistic regression compares lesbian and bisexual adolescents. Odds ratios are adjusted (aOR) for age, being born again Christian, race, income, and survey process 
variables (self-reported dishonesty in completing the survey and whether respondent completed the survey alone or with other people in the room). Statistically significant differences (p< .05) appear in bold 
text.
CI = confidence interval. M = mean. SE = standard error.
aAges at initiating kissing and fondling were not collected. Note that due to unstable estimates, the logistic regression models comparing bisexual to lesbian youth adjust for age only.

Multinomial logistic regression compares (1) lesbian, (2) bisexual, and (3) QUO (i.e., questioning, unsure, or other) to heterosexual. Logistic regression compares lesbian and bisexual adolescents. Odds are 
adjusted (aOR) for age, race, being born again Christian, income, and survey process variables (self-reported dishonesty in completing the survey and whether respondent completed the survey alone or with 
other people in the room). Statistically significant differences (p < .05) appear in bold text;
CI = confidence interval; NC = not calculable due to low cell size; RG = reference group.
aOf the 839 girls who reported having any type of sex, 33 declined to answer the number of lifetime sexual partners and were not asked follow-up questions about their most recent partner.
bAmong the 730 youth who had oral, penile-vaginal or penile-anal sex
cAmong the 518 youth who had penile-vaginal and/or penile-anal sex
dBecause of model instability, the odds ratio is adjusted for age only
