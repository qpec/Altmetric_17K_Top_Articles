Human aging is associated with an increased frequency of somatic mutations in
hematopoietic cells. Several of these recurrent mutations, including those in the gene
encoding the epigenetic modifier enzyme TET2, promote expansion of the mutant blood
cells. This clonal hematopoiesis correlates with an increased risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease. We studied the effects of the expansion of Tet2-mutant cells in
atherosclerosis-prone, low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient (Ldlr–/–) mice. We
found that partial bone marrow reconstitution with TET2-deficient cells was sufficient
for their clonal expansion and led to a marked increase in atherosclerotic plaque size.
TET2-deficient macrophages exhibited an increase in NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated
interleukin-1b secretion. An NLRP3 inhibitor showed greater atheroprotective activity
in chimeric mice reconstituted with TET2-deficient cells than in nonchimeric mice.
These results support the hypothesis that somatic TET2 mutations in blood cells play a
causal role in atherosclerosis.
C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading
cause of death in the elderly, but almost
60% of elderly patients with atherosclerotic
CVD have either no conventional risk factors
(e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
etc.) or just one risk factor (1). Furthermore, in-
creasing evidence suggests that most middle-aged
individuals at low risk of CVD, based on conven-
tional risk factors, exhibit subclinical atherosclerosis
(2, 3). These clinical data suggest that unidentified
age-dependent risk factors contribute to the dev-
elopment of CVD.
The accumulation of somatic DNA mutations
is a hallmark of aging, particularly in prolif-
erating tissues, which over time may become a
mosaic of cells with different genotypes due to
the clonal expansion of single de novo muta-
tions (4). However, though human studies sug-
gest that somatic mutations may be associated
with a broad spectrum of human disease (5–7),
there is little information on the potential causal
role of somatic mutations in age-associated dis-
orders other than cancer. Recent human studies
have shown that normal aging is associated
with an increased frequency of somatic muta-
tions in the hematopoietic system, which provide
a competitive growth advantage to the mutant
cell and allow its progressive clonal expansion
(clonal hematopoiesis) (7–11). This acquired
clonal mosaicism in the hematopoietic system
of healthy individuals correlates with an in-
creased risk of subsequent hematologic cancer
(7–9), but it has also been associated with higher
prevalence of vascular complications of dia-
betes, greater incidence of atherosclerotic con-
ditions (i.e., coronary heart disease, stroke), and
increased frequency of CVD-related deaths (6, 7).
Although these human studies suggest an un-
expected connection between somatic mutations
in hematopoietic cells, clonal hematopoiesis, and
atherosclerosis, their descriptive nature does not
allow cause-effect relationships, or even direc-
tionality, to be established.
Most of the reported somatic mutations as-
sociated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis
occur in a small number of genes encoding epi-
genetic regulators (7–10). The present study focuses
on one of these genes, TET2 (ten-eleven trans-
location 2), the first gene reported to exhibit somatic
mutations in blood cells in individuals with clonal
hematopoiesis without hematological malignancies
(10). More than 70 different mutations have been
reported in this gene (7–10, 12). The protein en-
coded by TET2 is an epigenetic regulatory enzyme
that catalyzes the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine
(5mc) in DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc)
and also exerts noncatalytic actions. TET2 modu-
lates hematopoietic stemandprogenitorcell(HSPC)
self-renewal (13–16), but its role in CVD remains
largely unexplored.
To mimic the human scenario of clonal hema-
topoiesis and test whether clonal expansion of
TET2-deficient hematopoietic cells contributes
to atherosclerosis, we used a competitive bone
marrow transplantation (BMT) strategy to gen-
erate atherosclerosis-prone, low-density lipo-
protein receptor–deficient (Ldlr−/−) chimeric
mice with a small proportion of TET2-deficient
HSPCs. Lethally irradiated Ldlr−/− recipients
were transplanted with suspensions of bone
marrow (BM) cells containing 10% Tet2−/− cells
and 90% Tet2+/+ cells [10% knockout (KO)–
BMT mice] and then fed a normal diet (ND) or
a high-fat/high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet for
9 weeks to induce atherosclerosis development
(fig. S1). To distinguish donor Tet2−/− and Tet2+/+
cells in this experimental setting, Tet2+/+ cells
were obtained from mice carrying the CD45.1
variant of the CD45 hematopoietic antigen,
whereas Tet2−/− cells were obtained from mice
carrying the CD45.2 variant of this protein.
Control mice [10% wild-type (WT)–BMT] were
transplanted with 10% CD45.2+ Tet2+/+ cells
and 90% CD45.1+ Tet2+/+ cells. Flow cytometry
analysis of CD45.2+ blood cells established that
this BMT strategy led to the clonal expansion
of Tet2−/− hematopoietic cells to an extent con-
sistent with variant allelic fractions for somatic
TET2 mutations observed in human studies link-
ing clonal hematopoiesis to accelerated CVD (7).
At the start of ND or HFHC diet feeding (4 weeks
after BMT), CD45.2+ cells represented ~28% of
blood cells in 10% KO-BMT mice, and they ex-
panded further over time, reaching 42% of blood
cells 6 weeks after BMT and 56% 12 weeks after
BMT (Fig. 1, A and B). This clonal expansion
of TET2-deficient hematopoietic cells is sim-
ilar to that observed when human cells carrying
somatic TET2 mutations are transplanted into
immune-deficient mice (17).
TET2 ablation in CD45.2+ cells of HFHC-fed
10% KO-BMT mice was confirmed by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
analysis of CD45.2+ white blood cell (WBC)
fractions (Fig. 1C and fig. S2A). No changes were
observed in the expression of TET1 or TET3, two
related epigenetic modulators. Consistent with the
enzymatic activity of TET2, ablation of the
gene was paralleled by a decrease in 5hmC levels
in WBCs and macrophages (fig. S2, B and C).
Although the absolute number of HSPCs [de-
fined as lineage–, Sca1+, c-Kit+ (LSK) cells] was
comparable between genotypes (fig. S3A), CD45.2+
cells represented 69% of LSK cells in the BM
(fig. S3B) and 61% in the spleen (fig. S3C) of
10% KO-BMT mice at 13 weeks post-BMT, con-
sistent with previous studies reporting that TET2
inactivation enhances HSPC self-renewal (13–16).

 Transplanted Tet2−/− BM cells expanded into all
blood cell lineages, regardless of type of diet, al-
though with a slight myeloid bias and a re-
duced expansion into the T-lymphoid lineage
in the BM, spleen, and blood (Fig. 1D and fig.
S3, D to F), in agreement with previous studies
with TET2-deficient mice (13–16). The expan-
sion of Tet2−/− HSPCs did not affect blood cell
counts (fig. S3G), consistent with findings in
cancer-free individuals carrying TET2 muta-
tions in blood cells (7, 10).
Having demonstrated that the competitive
BMT strategy leads to the clonal expansion of
TET2-deficient HSPCs and mimics the human
scenario of clonal hematopoiesis associated
with TET2 mutations, we next evaluated wheth-
er the clonal expansion of TET2-deficient HSPCs
affects atherogenesis and related metabolic ab-
normalities. We observed no effects on body
weight (fig. S4A), spleen weight (fig. S4B), blood
glucose levels (fig. S4C), systemic insulin sensi-
tivity (fig. S4D), or plasma cholesterol levels (fig.
S4E). ND-fed mice developed no aortic athero-
sclerosis, regardless of BM genotype (fig. S4F).
In contrast, clonal expansion of TET2-deficient
BM cells had a profound effect on HFHC-induced
atherosclerosis, as 10% KO-BMT mice exhibited
60% larger plaques in the aortic root than did
WT controls (Fig. 1E). Competitive BMT exper-
iments with Tet2+/− cells revealed that TET2
heterozygosity is sufficient to accelerate athe-
rosclerosis, despite the slower kinetics of TET2-
heterozygous cell expansion (fig. S5). Increased
atherogenesis in 10% KO-BMT mice was paral-
leled by an increase in total macrophage con-
tent in the intima, although this parameter was
not statistically significant when normalized to
plaque size (fig. S6). BM genotype did not affect
lesional content of collagen or vascular smooth
muscle cells (fig. S6), apoptosis (fig. S7A), ne-
crotic core extension (fig. S7B), or proliferation
rates of total plaque cells or lesional macro-
phages (fig. S7C). Overall, these data demon-
strate that clonal expansion of TET2-deficient
hematopoietic cells accelerates atherogenesis
in a manner independent of alterations in sys-
temic metabolism, changes in blood cell counts,
or macrophage proliferation or apoptosis in the
plaque.
Consistent with their above-mentioned pref-
erential differentiation into myeloid cells, TET2-
deficient HSPCs expanded preferentially into the
macrophage population in the atherosclerotic
vascular wall. CD45.2+ cells represented 58% of
total immune cells, 62% of macrophages, and
35% of T cells present in the aortic wall of 10%
KO-BMT mice (Fig. 1, F and G, and fig. S8). On
the basis of these findings, we hypothesized
that TET2-deficient hematopoietic cells accel-
erate atherosclerosis mainly by generating a
pool of macrophages with enhanced proathero-
genic activities. To test this possibility, we used
BMT and LysM-Cre/LoxP strategies to gener-
ate atherosclerosis-prone mice exhibiting TET2
deficiency restricted to myeloid cells (Mye-Tet2-
KO mice). Although this strategy led to a partial
(∼80%) inactivation of Tet2 in BM-derived macro-
phages (Fig. 2A), it was sufficient to increase
plaque size in the aortic root of HFHC-fed mice
(Fig. 2B), with no differences in body or spleen
weight, blood monocyte counts, or glucose and
cholesterol levels (fig. S9). These results dem-
onstrate that TET2 deficiency in myeloid cells
is sufficient to promote atherogenesis and
suggest that macrophages play a major role
in the accelerated atherosclerosis associated
with expansion of TET2-deficient HSPCs. How-
ever, they do not rule out a potential contribu-
tion from other BM-derived cells. Analysis of
aorta and aorta-draining mediastinal lymph
nodes showed that the expansion of TET2-
deficient HSPCs does not affect T cell num-
bers or aortic expression of T cell activation
markers (fig. S10, A to C), although it leads to
modest changes in the frequency of various T
cell subsets (fig. S10, D to G), consistent with
recent studies (18, 19). Such changes were not
observed in Mye-Tet2-KO mice (fig. S10, H to
J). Therefore, although a contribution of TET2-
deficient T cells to the atherogenic effects of
the expansion of TET2-deficient HSPCs can-
not be excluded, these data demonstrate that
changes in T cells are not essential for the ac-
celerated atherosclerosis associated with TET2
loss of function and suggest instead a predomi-
nant role of macrophages in this context.
We next evaluated the effects of TET2 de-
ficiency on the function of macrophages in cul-
ture. Consistent with the in vivo observations,
TET2 deficiency did not affect macrophage
proliferation (fig. S11A), apoptosis (fig. S11B),

 oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) up-
take (fig. S11C), or the expression of choles-
terol trafficking regulators (fig. S11, D and E).
To evaluate whether TET2 deficiency affects
proinflammatory macrophage activation, we
performed Affymetrix microarray analysis on
Tet2−/− macrophages and WT controls in rest-
ing conditions and after treatment with a
combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
interferon-g (IFN-g). Whereas no genes were
differentially expressed in unstimulated macro-
phages (q value < 0.05; fig. S12), a widespread
alteration in gene expression was found in Tet2−/−
macrophages after a 10-hour treatment with
LPS/IFN-g. Expression of 475 genes was altered
by more than a factor of 1.5 when compared with
WT macrophages (q < 0.05; Fig. 2C). PANTHER
functional annotation software revealed that
transcripts encoding cytokine, chemokine, and
signaling molecules were the top overrepre-
sented classes altered in the transcriptome of
LPS/IFN-g–treated TET2-deficient macrophages
(Fig. 2D). Genes in these classes with known
proinflammatory actions were mostly up-regu-
lated in TET2-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2E).
Consistent with this observation, qRT-PCR anal-
ysis revealed that TET2-deficient macrophages
exhibit markedly increased expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 2F and fig. S13,
A and B), chemokines (fig. S13C), and enzymes
(fig. S13D). This pattern of gene expression was
also evident in Tet2+/− macrophages and macro-
phages isolated from Mye-Tet2-KO mice (fig.
S13, E and F). TET2 deficiency also resulted in
increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein levels in
macrophage culture supernatants (fig. S13G).
These data suggest that TET2 acts as a negative
transcriptional regulator of proinflammatory re-
sponses and are consistent with a previous study
reporting that TET2 represses LPS-induced IL-6
expression (20).
However, the situation in vivo in the athero-
sclerotic plaque is particularly complex, as lesional
macrophages are exposed to multiple signals
simultaneously. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory
actions of TET2 in cultured macrophages were
further evaluated by testing their effect on macro-
phage response to a cocktail of low doses of
oxLDL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IFN-g,
three stimuli present in atherosclerotic plaques.
These conditions minimized the impact of TET2
deficiency on cytokine and chemokine expression
(fig. S14), with the exception of IL-1b, which was
markedly up-regulated in TET2-deficient macro-
phages at all time points of oxLDL/TNF/IFN-g
stimulation (Fig. 3A). Supporting a predominant
role for IL-1b in the exacerbated atherosclerosis
associated with TET2 loss of function, gene ex-
pression analysis of the aortic arch of HFHC-fed
mice revealed a significant >twofold increase in
transcript levels of IL-1b in 10% KO-BMT versus
10% WT-BMT mice (Fig. 3B), whereas few sig-
nificant differences were observed in the aortic
expression of other cytokines and chemokines or
other macrophage-enriched genes (fig. S15). 10%
KO-BMT also exhibited increased IL-1b protein
levels in atherosclerotic plaques and plaque
macrophages, as revealed by immunofluores-
cence staining coupled to confocal microscopy
(Fig. 3, C and D).
To examine the molecular mechanisms under-
lying the effects of TET2 deficiency on IL-1b expres-
sion, we performed cell culture studies with LPS/
IFN-g–treated macrophages transiently overexpres-
sing either WT TET2 or a TET2 mutant unable to
catalyze the oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC. Both WT-
TET2 and mutant-TET2 overexpression led to a
∼90% reduction in IL-1b expression and blunted
differences between Tet2+/+ and Tet2−/− macro-
phages (Fig. 3E), suggesting that TET2 mod-
ulates IL-1b expression independent of its

REPORT
 catalytic activity. Therefore, we investigated
noncatalytic mechanisms of TET2-mediated
transcriptional repression. Consistent with pre-
vious studies showing that TET2 inhibits gene
transcription via histone deacetylase (HDAC)–
mediated histone deacetylation (20), treatment
with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) in-
creased IL-1b expression in LPS/IFN-g–treated
macrophages and abolished expression differ-
ences between TET2-deficient and WT geno-
types (Fig. 3F). Further supporting a role for
histone deacetylation in TET2-mediated re-
pression of IL-1b, chromatin immunoprecipi-
tation (ChIP)–qPCR analysis revealed greater
histone H3 acetylation at the Il1b gene pro-
moter in TET2-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3G).
In contrast, treatment with TSA reduced the
expression of transcripts corresponding to other
proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6), in
agreement with previous reports (21), and did
not affect differences between genotypes (fig.
S16A). Furthermore, H3 acetylation at the Il6
gene promoter was not affected by TET2 abla-
tion (fig. S16B). Overall, these data suggest that
a reduction in HDAC-mediated histone deacet-
ylation accounts for the effects of TET2 loss of
function on IL-1b expression in macrophages,
whereas alternative mechanisms contribute to
its effects on other genes.
Given that IL-1b is synthesized as an inactive
protein (pro–IL-1b), which requires cleavage for
its secretion, the effects of TET2 deficiency on
IL-1b posttranslational processing were also eval-
uated. IL-1b cleavage is frequently mediated by
the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein com-
plex that is activated by “danger signals” (intra-
cellular molecules that are released as a result
of disturbance of tissue homeostasis). NLRP3
inflammasome activation is typically a two-step
process requiring a priming signal, which promotes
pro–IL-1b/NLRP3 expression, and an activation
signal, which promotes inflammasome assembly.
To investigate whether TET2 deficiency facilitates
NLRP3-mediated IL-1b processing, IL-1b cleavage
was evaluated by Western blot in LPS/IFN-g–
primed macrophages treated with adenosine tri-
phosphate (ATP) for inflammasome activation.
TET2-deficient macrophages exhibited significant
increases in intracellular pro–IL-1b and cleaved
IL-1b (Fig. 4, A and B). However, the effect on
cleaved IL-1b levels (2.5-fold; Fig. 4B) was sub-
stantially greater than that on pro–IL-1b levels
(1.6-fold;Fig. 4A), which suggests that TET2 loss
of function promotes IL-1b secretion by macro-
phages beyond its effects on IL-1b transcrip-
tion. Consistent with these findings, Western
blot (Fig. 4C) and enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (ELISA) analysis (Fig. 4D) revealed
a >threefold increase in secreted IL-1b levels
in LPS/IFN-g/ATP–treated TET2-deficient macro-
phages. IL-1b secretion was completely abro-
gated by cotreatment with MCC950 (Fig. 4D), a
specific NLRP3 inhibitor (22), which suggests
that TET2 deficiency affects NLRP3-mediated
IL-1b secretion.
To further test this possibility, we evaluated
the effect of TET2 on the expression of the main
NLRP3 inflammasome components. TET2 defi-
ciency significantly increased NLRP3 expression
in LPS/IFN-g–treated (fig. S17, A and B) and
oxLDL/TNF/IFN-g–treated macrophages (fig. S17C),
whereas no change was observed in the expres-
sion of other inflammasome components (fig. S17,
D and E). TET2 deficiency also enhanced IL-
1b secretion induced by cotreatment with choles-
terol crystals (Fig. 4E), a relevant inducer of
inflammasome activation in atherosclerosis (23).
Increased activity of caspase 1 (enzymatic com-
ponent of the NLRP3 inflammasome) was de-
tected in plaque macrophages of 10% KO-BMT
mice, as revealed by FAM-YVAD-FMK fluorescent
staining with a FLICA probe (Fig. 4F), supporting
the hypothesis that TET2 ablation enhances NLRP3
inflammasome activity in vivo in the atherosclerotic
plaque. Overall, these data demonstrate that TET2
deficiency contributes to IL-1b production in macro-
phages by enhancing NLRP3 priming in addition
to promoting Il1b gene transcription. The data
are also consistent with a central role of enhanced
IL-1b signaling in the increased atheroscle-
rosis associated with expansion of TET2-deficient
hematopoietic cells. In support of this idea, when
10% KO-BMT mice were continuously infused
with the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950, the differ-
ence in aortic plaque size between these chi-
meric mice and the nonchimeric control mice
was eliminated (Fig. 4G). This MCC950 treatment
did not affect the expansion of TET2-deficient
cells (fig. S18). These studies revealed that MCC950
exerts greater atheroprotective actions in con-
ditions of clonal hematopoiesis associated with
TET2 deficiency, as it decreased atherosclerotic
plaque size by ~50% in 10% KO-BMT mice, where-
as it led to a nonstatistically significant ~20%
reduction in 10% WT-BMT controls. Overall,
these studies demonstrate that NLRP3-mediated
IL-1b overproduction is essential for the athero-
genic consequences of clonal expansion of TET2-
deficient cells.
Having demonstrated the role of NLRP3-
mediated IL-1b secretion, we next explored po-
tential atherogenic mechanisms downstream of
this proinflammatory cytokine. The proathero-
genic actions of IL-1 signaling are mediated pri-
marily by its effects on vascular cells (24), and
IL-1b modulates endothelial cell adhesion ex-
pression in various settings (24–26). On the
basis of these findings and the key role of endo-
thelial cell activation in early atherogenesis, we

 evaluated whether the increased IL-1b expression
in 10% KO-BMT mice was paralleled by changes
in the aortic expression of endothelial adhesion
molecules. The expression of P-selectin was sig-
nificantly increased in HFHC-fed 10% KO-BMT
mice (fig. S19A), and there was a significant cor-
relation between IL-1b and P-selectin expression
in the aorta (fig. S19B). MCC950 treatment ab-
rogated the increased expression of P-selectin
in 10% KO-BMT mice (fig. S19C), supporting the
contribution of IL-1b to the aortic expression
of P-selectin. Given the major role of P-selectin
in monocyte recruitment to the atherosclerotic
plaque, we hypothesized that TET2-deficient
macrophages contribute to endothelial cell activa-
tion and monocyte recruitment. Supporting this
hypothesis, leukocyte homing experiments based
on the adoptive transfer of green fluorescent
protein+ (GFP+) (Tet2-WT) myeloid cells re-
vealed increased recruitment to the aortic wall
of Mye-Tet2-KO mice compared with WT con-
trols (fig. S19D).
In summary, our results support a causal link
between exacerbated atherosclerosis and clonal
hematopoiesis induced by somatic mutations.
Combined with the observations made in human
studies (7), our mouse data suggest that somatic
TET2 mutations could potentially be targeted for
the development of new therapies or preventive
care strategies for atherosclerosis. Furthermore,
when considered in light of previous cancer
studies (12, 14, 15), these results support the
notion that the expansion of TET2-mutant HSPCs
represents a pathophysiological mechanism that
is shared between blood cancers and CVD. Our
study also revealed that exacerbated NLRP3-
mediated IL-1b production is essential for accel-
erated atherosclerosis in a context of clonal
hematopoiesis due to TET2 loss of function. IL-
1b is a potential therapeutic target in the setting
of atherosclerosis, and neutralizing anti–IL-1b anti-
bodies are being evaluated in clinical trials for the
treatment of CVD (27). Our findings suggest that
IL-1b blockade or NLRP3 inflammasome inhibi-
tion may be particularly effective for the preven-
tion and treatment of CVD in individuals carrying
somatic mutations in TET2. Future studies are
warranted to address this possibility.
