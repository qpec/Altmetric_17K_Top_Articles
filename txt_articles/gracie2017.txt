Eff
 ect of psychological therapy on disease activity, 
psychological comorbidity, and quality of life in infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Summary
Background Infl
 ammatory bowel disease is associated with psychological comorbidity and impaired quality of life. 
Psychological comorbidity could aff
 ect the natural history of infl
 ammatory bowel disease. Psychological therapies 
might therefore have benefi
 cial eff
 ects on disease activity, mood, and quality of life in patients with infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis examining these issues.
Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, 
PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published between 1947 and 
Sept 22, 2016. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease aged at 
least 16 years that compared psychological therapy with a control intervention or usual treatment were eligible. We 
pooled dichotomous data to obtain relative risks of induction of remission in active disease or prevention of 
relapse of quiescent disease, with 95% CIs. We pooled continuous data to estimate standardised mean diff
 erences 
in disease activity indices, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and quality-of-life scores in patients dichotomised 
into those with clinically active or quiescent disease, with 95% CIs. We extracted data from published reports and 
contacted the original investigators of studies for which the required data were not available. We pooled all data 
using a random-eff
 ects model. 
Findings The search identifi
 ed 1824 studies, with 14 RCTs of 1196 patients eligible for inclusion. The relative risk of relapse 
of quiescent infl
 ammatory bowel disease with psychological therapy versus control was 0·98 (95% CI 0·77–1·24; p=0·87; 
I²=50%; six trials; 518 patients). We observed a signifi
 cant diff
 erence in depression scores (standardised mean diff
 erence 
–0·17 [–0·33 to –0·01]; p=0·04; I²=0%; seven trials; 605 patients) and quality of life (0·30 [0·07–0·52]; p=0·01; I²=42%; 
nine trials; 578 patients) with psychological therapy versus control at the end of therapy for patients with quiescent disease. 
However, these benefi
 cial eff
 ects were lost at fi
 nal point of follow-up (depression scores –0·11 [–0·27 to 0·05], p=0·17, 
I²=0%, eight trials, 593 patients; quality of life 0·15 [–0·05 to 0·34], p=0·14, I²=22%, ten trials, 577 patients). When we 
assessed the eff
 ect of individual physiological therapies on quality of life, only cognitive behavioural therapy had any 
signifi
 cant benefi
 cial eff
 ect (0·37 [0·02–0·72]). We noted no eff
 ect on disease activity indices or other psychological 
wellbeing scores when compared with control in patients with quiescent disease. Dichotomous data for induction of 
remission and continuous data for change in clinical disease activity indices, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress 
scores were only reported in one RCT of patients with active disease. Quality of life was assessed in two RCTs of patients 
with active disease, but was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between intervention and control groups (0·27 [–0·05 to 0·59]).
Interpretation Psychological therapies, and cognitive behavioural therapy in particular, might have small short-term 
benefi
 cial eff
 ects on depression scores and quality of life in patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease. Further RCTs 
of these interventions in patients with coexistent psychological distress are required.
Funding None.
Introduction
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known 
as infl
 ammatory bowel disease, are chronic infl
 ammatory 
conditions of the gastrointestinal tract without cure. 
Throughout a lifetime of disease, the typical natural 
history is that of quiescence, interspersed with episodic 
fl
 are-ups of disease activity. Although the cause of 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease remains uncertain, several 
factors are implicated in its development, including 
proinfl
 ammatory dysbiosis, impaired intestinal barrier 
function, and enteric immune system dysfunction. The 
increased prevalence of depression and anxiety observed 
among patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease1,2 has 
led to suggestions that coexistence of mood disorders 
might infl
 uence the natural history,3–5 although whether 
or not these disorders aff
 ect the development of 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease is uncertain.6,7
In 
infl
 ammatory 
bowel 
disease, 
psychological 
comorbidity, including anxiety, depression, somatisation, 
and perceived stress, is associated not only with active 
disease, but also with ongoing symptoms in the absence 
of infl
 ammation.8–12 Although a temporal relationship 
between the presence of psychological comorbidity and 
the onset of infl
 ammatory bowel disease activity has been

suggested,13 a causal relationship remains unproven. If 
this association is genuine, activation of the brain–gut 
axis, involving autonomic nervous system-mediated 
catecholamine release and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis secretion of stress hormones, and the gastrointestinal 
response to this activation, might contribute.14–16 These 
brain–gut interactions have been studied in other chronic 
gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel 
syndrome, for which the relationship between gastro-
intestinal symptoms and psychological comorbidity is 
well established17 and for which the eff
 ect can be 
bidirectional.18,19
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological 
therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or 
hypnotherapy, have been done in irritable bowel syndrome, 
and fi
 ndings from meta-analyses20,21 of these studies have 
shown that they are effi
  cacious treatments. However, 
whether or not these therapies are also eff
 ective in 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease remains uncertain. Authors of 
a previous systematic review and meta-analysis22 published 
in 2011 suggested that these therapies were possibly of 
benefi
 t in adolescents, but not in adults. However, the 
authors included quasi-randomised and non-randomised 
studies in their analysis and numerous additional studies23–33 
have been published in the intervening years. We therefore 
aimed to re-examine the effi
  cacy of psychological therapies 
in infl
 ammatory bowel disease, with particular emphasis on 
their eff
 ects on disease activity indices, psychological 
wellbeing—including anxiety, depression, and perceived 
stress—and quality of life.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 
MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, PsychINFO, and 
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for 
articles published between 1947 and Sept 22, 2016, to 
identify RCTs investigating the eff
 ects of psychological 
therapies on infl
 ammatory bowel disease. Eligible RCTs 
had to include patients aged at least 16 years with an 
endoscopically, histologically, or radiologically confi
 rmed 
diagnosis of infl
 ammatory bowel disease and report the 
eff
 ect of any psychological therapy when compared with 
control, including a physician’s usual management, 
symptom monitoring, or supportive therapy. Outcomes 
had to be either dichotomous outcomes of failure of 
remission in active disease or relapse of disease in 
quiescent disease or continuous outcomes of clinical 
disease activity, depression, anxiety (including state and 
trait anxiety), perceived stress, or quality of life.
We used the following search terms: “cognitive 
therapy”, 
“psychotherapy”, 
“behaviour 
therapy”, 
“relaxation techniques”, “mindfulness”, “meditation”, or 
“hypnosis” (both as Medical Subject Headings and 
free-text terms) and the following free-text search terms: 
“behavioural therapy”, “relaxation therapy”, “mindfulness 
meditation”, or “hypnotherapy”. We combined these 
terms using the Boolean set operator AND with studies 
identifi
 ed using the following terms: “Crohn disease”, 
“infl
 ammatory bowel disease”, “colitis”, “ileitis”, or 
“ulcerative colitis” (both as Medical Subject Headings 
and free-text terms) and “Crohn$ disease” or “regional 
enteritis” (as free-text terms). We applied no language 
restrictions to the search and translated any articles not 
published in English. DJG did the literature search. 
We assessed all titles and abstracts identifi
 ed by the 
search for inclusion and did a recursive search of the 
bibliographies of selected articles. Two investigators 
(DJG and AJI or DJG and RS) judged eligibility of the 
selected articles independently using predesigned 
eligibility forms and a third (ACF) resolved any 
disagreements. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Evidence is increasing to suggest that poor psychological health 
might have negative eff
 ects on the natural history of 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease. Psychological therapies are 
eff
 ective in the treatment of mood disorders. Evidence supports 
use of psychological therapies in some gastrointestinal diseases, 
including irritable bowel syndrome. Findings from a previous 
systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled 
trials suggested that psychological therapies might have 
benefi
 cial eff
 ects on quality of life in infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease, but data were scarce and diff
 erent types of therapy were 
not discussed.
Added value of this study
We have done a contemporaneous systematic review and 
meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials reporting the eff
 ect 
of psychological therapies in infl
 ammatory bowel disease. We did 
a subgroup analysis of the eff
 ects of diff
 erent types of 
psychological therapy. Psychological therapies, particularly 
cognitive behavioural therapy, improved depression scores and 
quality of life in patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease in the 
short term. Psychological therapies did not appear to have any 
eff
 ect on disease activity or other measures of psychological 
wellbeing in patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease. 
Implications of all the available evidence
 
Although the eff
 ect of psychological therapy on infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease appears small, studies to date have focused on 
the eff
 ect of these interventions in the general infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease population rather than in the subgroups of 
patients with coexistent psychological distress or fatigue who 
might benefi
 t to a greater degree than might those without. 
Further investigation of the eff
 ect of psychological therapy in 
these patients is, therefore, warranted.

Data analysis
Data was extracted independently by two investigators 
(DJG and AJI or DJG and RS). As most RCTs recruited 
patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease, rather than 
only those with Crohn’s disease or with ulcerative colitis, 
we pooled studies to examine the overall eff
 ect of 
psychological therapies in infl
 ammatory bowel disease, 
rather than according to disease type. For dichotomous 
outcomes, we extracted data as an intention-to-treat 
analysis, whenever trial reporting allowed this, with all 
dropouts assumed to be treatment non-responders. 
However, because of high levels of dropout in some 
trials, we did a sensitivity analysis using a per-proto 
col 
analysis. For continuous variables, we recorded mean 
scores and SDs after psychological therapy or control 
only for those who provided complete data so as not to 
overestimate the effi
  cacy of psychological therapies 
in infl
 ammatory bowel disease. The evidence base 
for psychological interventions in management of 
depression and anxiety is greatest for CBT.34 We therefore 
did a subgroup analysis including only trials using CBT 
to assess whether or not the eff
 ect was stronger for this 
treatment alone than for all treatments combined. 
Dichotomous outcomes assessed were the effi
  cacy of 
psychological therapy versus control in terms of remission 
of active infl
 ammatory bowel disease or of prevention of 
relapse of disease activity in quiescent infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease. We extracted data for these endpoints at 
the fi
 nal point of trial follow-up to maximise the number 
of events in the analysis. Continuous outcomes assessed 
were the effi
  cacy of psychological therapies versus control 
in terms of eff
 ect on clinical disease activity indices, 
anxiety scores, depression scores, perceived stress scores, 
or quality of life scores. We analysed trials separately 
according to whether they recruited patients with 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease with clinically active disease 
at the time of randomisation or those whose disease was 
quiescent. As the eff
 ect of psychological therapies on 
mood and quality of life might be greatest immediately 
after completion of therapy, we extracted data for these 
endpoints at both completion of therapy and the fi
 nal 
point of follow-up. For the ten studies that did not report 
these types of data, but were otherwise eligible for 
inclusion in the meta-analysis, we attempted to contact 
the original investigators to obtain supplementary 
dichotomous or continuous data. In six of these trials we 
were successful.23,25,28,29,32,33
Two investigators (DJG and AJI or DJG and RS) 
assessed the risk of bias in accordance with guidance 
published in the Cochrane handbook.35 We resolved any 
disagreement by discussion. We assessed risk of bias 
by recording the methods used to generate the 
randomisation schedule and conceal treatment allocation, 
whether or not masking was implemented for par-
ticipants, personnel, and outcome assessment, what 
proportion of patients completed follow-up, whether or 
not an intention-to-treat analysis was extractable, and 
whether or not evidence could be seen of selective 
reporting of outcomes.
We also recorded the following additional data for each 
trial: type of psychological therapy used, country, setting 
(primary care-based, secondary care-based, or tertiary 
care-based), number of centres, number of sessions of 
psychological therapy administered, duration of therapy, 
and duration of follow-up. We also recorded what the 
control group was in each trial.
We measured the degree of agreement between the 
two investigators in terms of judgment of study 
eligibility using a κ statistic. For dichotomous outcomes, 
we expressed the eff
 ect of psychological therapies as a 
relative risk (RR) of not achieving remission, with 
95% CIs, for intervention versus control in trials of 
therapy for active infl
 ammatory bowel disease or as a 
RR of relapse of disease activity in trials of therapy for 
quiescent infl
 ammatory bowel disease. For instances in 
which psychological therapies appeared more eff
 ective 
than did control, we planned to calculate the number 
needed to treat, along with 95% CIs, using the 
formula 1/control event rate × (1–RR). For continuous 
data (eff
 ect on clinical disease activity indices, 
psychological wellbeing scores, and quality-of-life 
scores), we summarised the eff
 ect of psychological 
therapies using standardised mean diff
 erences (SMDs) 
and 95% CIs.

We assessed heterogeneity between studies using the 
I² statistic, with a cutoff
  of 50%, above which indicated 
substantial heterogeneity,36 and the χ² test with a p value 
of less than 0·10 as the threshold to defi
 ne a signifi
 cant 
degree of heterogeneity. We had strict inclusion criteria 
to minimise variability within studies. We pooled all data 
using a random-eff
 ects model37 to give a conservative 
estimate of the eff
 ect of psychological therapies on 
disease outcomes in infl
 ammatory bowel disease. We 
used Review Manager version 5.3 to generate forest plots 
of pooled RRs and SMDs with 95% CIs, as well as funnel 
plots. We assessed these plots if they included a suffi
  cient 
number of studies (at least ten) in the meta-analysis38 
for evidence of asymmetry and therefore possible 
publication bias or other small study eff
 ects using the 
Egger test.39

Results
The literature search identifi
 ed 1824 studies, of which, 
after title and abstract review, we deemed 46 potentially 
relevant and assessed them further for eligibility 
(fi
 gure 1). Of these studies, we excluded a further 32 for 
various reasons, leaving 14 studies of 1196 patients 
eligible for data extraction.23–33,40–42 Agreement between 
reviewers for eligibility assessment was excellent 
(κ statistic 0·91). Detailed study characteristics are 
provided in table 1, and risk of bias across all studies is 
reported in the appendix (p 1).
Only two of the 14 eligible RCTs included patients with 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease with ongoing active 
disease.30,31 Only one of these studies reported 
dichotomous data for the effi
  cacy of psychological 
therapy in induction of remission of active infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease.30 12 (21%) of 57 patients receiving 
psychological 
therapy 
entered 
clinical 
remission 
compared with two (4%) of 57 patients in the control 
group, after 18 months of follow-up. In terms of eff
 ect on 
other outcomes—ie, change in clinical disease activity 
indices,30 depression,31 anxiety,31 and perceived stress 
scores31—each of these outcomes was reported in only 
one RCT and therefore formal meta-analysis was not 
possible. Psychological therapy was not associated 
with an improvement in any of these outcomes 
when compared with control in patients with active 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease. Both studies assessed the 
eff
 ect of psychological therapy on quality of life in a total 
of 153 patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease. The 
SMD in quality of life score at the fi
 nal point of follow-up 
was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between the intervention 
and control groups (0·27 [95% CI –0·05 to 0·59]).
12 of the 14 eligible RCTs assessed the required 
outcomes in patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease 
who had quiescent disease at randomisation.23–29,32,33,40–42 
Four of these studies presented data in patients with 
Crohn’s disease,25,32,40,42 four presented data in patients

ulcerative colitis,27,28,41 and two included patients with 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease.24,29 159 (57%) of 277 patients 
given psychological therapy had a relapse of disease 
activity compared with 127 (53%) of 241 patients in the 
control groups. Compared with control, the RR of relapse 
of disease activity in all patients with infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease given psychological therapy was 0·98 
(95% CI 0·77–1·24; p=0·87; fi
 gure 2). We noted signifi
 cant 
heterogeneity between studies (I²=50%; p=0·07), but we 
identifi
 ed too few studies to assess for publication bias. 
When we studied the eff
 ect of psychological therapies on 
relapse of disease activity according to whether trials 
recruited patients with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, 
or infl
 ammatory bowel disease, no eff
 ect of psychological 
therapies at fi
 nal point of follow-up was seen (fi
 gure 2). 
Per-protocol analysis did not reveal any benefi
 cial eff
 ect of 
psychological therapies on disease relapse (RR 0·86 
[95% CI 0·71–1·05]), with no hetero 
geneity between 
studies (I²=0%; p=0·46).
Eight RCTs reported data for the eff
 ect of psychological 
therapy on disease activity indices in patients with 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease at the fi
 nal point of 
follow-up.23,24,26,27,32,33,40,41 Six assessed the eff
 ect in Crohn’s 
disease23,24,26,32,33,40 and seven assessed the eff
 ect in ulcerative 
colitis.23,24,26,27,33,40,41 No signifi
 cant diff
 erence was noted in 
disease activity indices among those treated with 
psychological therapy compared with those in the control 
group at the fi
 nal point of follow-up (SMD –0·03 [95% CI 
–0·20 to 0·14]; p=0·73; fi
 gure 3), with no evidence of 
heterogeneity between studies (I²=0%; p=0·87). Again, we 
identifi
 ed too few studies to assess for publication bias. 
We also noted no eff
 ect of psychological therapies on 
disease activity indices among patients with Crohn’s 
disease or with ulcerative colitis (fi
 gure 3).
Five studies provided data for the eff
 ect of 
psychological therapy on anxiety scores in infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease at the end of therapy23,24,33,40,41 and 
fi
 ve provided data at the fi
 nal point of follow-up.23,24,32,33,40 
At completion of therapy, when we pooled data from 
504 patients, we noted no eff
 ect of psychological 
therapies on anxiety scores (SMD –0·14 [95% CI 
–0·33 to 0·04]; p=0·13; appendix p 2). We noted no 
heterogeneity between the included RCTs (I²=7%; 
p=0·37) and we identifi
 ed too few studies to assess for 
publication bias. At the fi
 nal point of follow-up, we still 
noted no eff
 ect of psychological therapies on anxiety 
scores (table 2). We also noted no eff
 ect of psychological 
therapies on state13,26,42 or trait13,26,27 anxiety scores in 
three trials at either completion of therapy or fi
 nal point 
of follow-up (table 2, appendix p 4–7).
Seven studies examined the eff
 ect of psychological 
therapy on depression scores in infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease at the end of therapy23,24,26,27,33,40,42 and eight examined 
the eff
 ect at the fi
 nal point of follow-up.23,24,26,27,32,33,40,42 Data 
were available for 605 patients at completion of therapy, 
with an SMD of –0·17 (95% CI –0·33 to –0·01; p=0·04; 
appendix p 8), with no heterogeneity between studies 
(I²=0%; p=0·76). Again, we identifi
 ed too few studies to 
assess for publication bias. At the fi
 nal point of follow-up, 
the eff
 ect on depression scores was no longer evident 
(table 2; appendix p 9). We identifi
 ed too few studies to 
assess for publication bias.
Six RCTs reported data for the eff
 ect of psychological 
therapy on perceived stress score in infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease.23–25,27–29 When we pooled data at the end of therapy, 
psychological therapy had no eff
 ect on perceived stress 
scores in 434 patients (SMD –0·07 [95% CI –0·31 to 0·18]; 
p=0·59; appendix p 10), with no heterogeneity between 
studies (I²=34%; p=0·18). At the fi
 nal point of follow-up, 
we still noted no benefi
 cial eff
 ect of psychological 
therapies compared with control, again with no 
heterogeneity noted between included studies (table 2; 
appendix p 11). We identifi
 ed too few studies to assess for 
publication bias in both these analyses. Again, we noted 
no eff
 ects according to whether studies recruited patients 
with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease (appendix p 11).
11 studies reported data for the eff
 ect of psychological 
therapy on quality of life in infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease.23–29,32,33,41,42 Nine of these studies assessed eff
 ects 
on infl

four examined eff
 ect on physical or mental quality of 
life separately,23,24,28,33 both at the end of therapy and the 
fi
 nal point of follow-up. We noted a signifi
 cant 
improvement in infl
 ammatory bowel disease-specifi
 c 
quality of life at the end of therapy when we pooled data 
from 578 patients (SMD 0·30 [95% CI 0·07–0·52]; 
p=0·01; fi
 gure 4). We observed borderline heterogeneity 
between the included studies (I²=42%; p=0·09), but we 
identifi
 ed too few studies to assess for publication bias. 
When we studied the eff
 ect of psychological therapies 
on infl
 ammatory bowel disease-specifi
 c quality of life 
according to whether trials recruited patients with 
Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease, we only observed a benefi
 t among 
patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease (SMD 0·37 
[95% CI 0·15–0·59]; p=0·001; fi
 gure 4). Any benefi
 cial 
eff
 ect of psychological therapy on infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease-specifi
 c quality of life at completion of therapy 
was lost by the fi
 nal point of follow-up (appendix p 12). 
We noted no heterogeneity between studies (table 2) 
and no evidence of publication bias (Egger test p=0·44).
When compared with control, psychological therapy had 
no eff
 ect on physical (SMD 0·17 [95% CI –0·03 to 0·37]; 
I²=0%; p=0·54) or mental (0·15 [–0·05 to 0·34]; I²=0%; 
p=0·57) quality of life at completion of therapy in 
399 patients. We noted no evidence of heterogeneity 
between studies in these analyses, although with only 
four studies, power to detect this heterogeneity would be 
low. At the fi
 nal point of follow-up in 363 patients, we 
noted no diff
 erence in physical (0·02 [–0·19 to 0·23]; 
I²=0%; p=0·94) or mental (0·05 [–0·22 to 0·32]; I²=40%; 
p=0·17) quality of life when we compared those receiving 
psychological therapy with control, with no heterogeneity 
noted for either outcome. We identifi
 ed too few studies to 
assess for publication bias in all of these analyses.
Five studies, including 511 patients with infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease, reported data for the eff
 ect of CBT on 
one or more of the study endpoints.23–26,29 We noted a 
signifi
 cant improvement in quality of life at the end of 
therapy when we pooled data from 254 patients 
(SMD 0·37 [95% CI 0·02–0·72]; appendix p 13), 
although this benefi
 cial eff
 ect was lost at the fi
 nal point 
of follow-up. We noted no other signifi
 cant eff
 ect of 
CBT on disease activity indices, anxiety or depression 
scores, or perceived stress scores when compared with 
control therapy (appendix pp 14–20).
Discussion
Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis 
have shown that psychological therapies might provide a 
small, short-term improvement in depression scores 
and quality life in patients with clinically quiescent 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease, but that these eff
 ects appear 
to be lost over time. The benefi
 cial eff
 ect on quality of life 
was most notable when we only included RCTs that used 
CBT, which is thought to have the best evidence for

effi
  cacy in management of anxiety and depression.34 
Otherwise, psychological therapies did not appear to 
improve either clinical disease indices or psychological 
outcomes in patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease. 
We did not fi
 nd any benefi
 ts of psychological therapies 
according to type of infl
 ammatory bowel disease. 
Furthermore, we noted no signifi
 cant eff
 ect on most 
measurements of mood, either at the point at which 
psychological therapy had just been completed or during 
extended follow-up. Part of this absence of benefi
 t might 
have arisen from an absence of sensitivity or specifi
 city 
of the instruments used to detect changes in mood, as 
well as failure by most of the trials to recruit only patients 
who had abnormal levels of psychological health when 
compared with the general population.
Strengths of this study include the rigorous methods 
adopted. Several of the studies included in the 
2011 Cochrane review22 addressing this issue did not fulfi
 l 
our inclusion criteria for various reasons. These reasons 
included an absence of randomisation,43,44 recruitment of 
patients with both active and quiescent disease, with no 
separate reporting for these distinct groups of patients,45 
study 
of 
an 
adolescent 
population,46 
redundant 
publication,47 or provision of no extractable data.48 
Additionally, we made every eff
 ort to contact the authors of 
potentially eligible studies for which dichotomous or 
continuous data of interest were not available in the 
published manuscript. We used an intention-to-treat 
analysis, with all patients lost to follow-up assumed to be 
treatment non-responders for dichotomous endpoints 
such as remission or relapse of disease activity to avoid 
overestimation of the eff
 ect of the active intervention. 
We also pooled all data using a random-eff
 ects model to 
give a conservative estimate of the eff
 ect of psychological 
therapies on infl
 ammatory bowel disease. A further 
strength of this study is the number of participants 
included. This systematic review and meta-analysis 
included an additional 11 contemporaneous studies23–33 and 
almost three times more participants than were included 
in the Cochrane review.22 We did analyses according to type 
of infl
 ammatory bowel disease to assess whether or not 
any benefi
 t existed of psychological therapy in either 
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. Finally, we did a 
subgroup analysis to investigate the eff
 ect of CBT alone as 
this therapy has the best evidence for use in anxiety 
and depression.34
This study has limitations, which arise mainly from 
the small number of studies available for analysis and

their risk of bias. Although we noted no signifi
 cant 
heterogeneity in most of the endpoints studied, we 
noted signifi
 cant heterogeneity between RCTs reporting 
on the eff
 ect of psychological therapies on relapse of 
disease activity in quiescent infl
 ammatory bowel disease. 
Additionally, all of the trials that we identifi
 ed were at 
high risk of bias because of the absence of adequate 
masking, with only one trial using a double-blind 
design.27 This bias is often a problem with studies of 
psychological therapies, although assessors can be 
masked to therapy. However, only four of the studies 
that we identifi
 ed did this masking.28,30,33,42 The included 
studies used various control groups, which might mean 
that pooling of data from them could be viewed as 
inappropriate. The fact that duration of follow-up was 
not uniform between eligible studies might also mean 
that a signifi
 cant benefi
 t of psychological therapies, 
which is perhaps time dependent, has been overlooked. 
Individual trials also used diff
 ering types, formats, 
durations, and intensities of psychological therapy, 
which might have led to an absence of benefi
 t when we 
pooled all studies together. However, when we 
considered only the fi
 ve RCTs that used CBT in the 
analysis, we still noted no eff
 ect on disease activity 
indices, anxiety or depression scores, or perceived stress 
scores. Finally, the trials that we identifi
 ed span an 
18 year period, during which time management of 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease has been revolutionised by 
the advent of biological therapies. We cannot exclude the 
possibility that increasing use of these drugs in more 
recent studies might have had an eff
 ect on the fi
 ndings 
of this meta-analysis.
Our fi
 ndings are in keeping with those previously 
published 
in 
adult 
infl
 ammatory 
bowel 
disease 
populations.22 Other than a signifi
 cant improvement in 
depression and quality-of-life scores immediately after 
cessation of therapy, we did not detect a signifi
 cant benefi
 t 
of these interventions in infl
 ammatory bowel disease. 
Despite this fi
 nding, psychological therapy has been 
shown to be eff
 ective in the treatment of other chronic 
gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel 
syndrome,21 functional dyspepsia,49 and non-cardiac chest 
pain.50 Most of the RCTs included in this meta-analysis 
were done in patients in clinical remission. Only two 
examined the eff
 ect of psychological therapy in active 
disease.30,31 However, fi
 ndings from observational studies 
of infl
 ammatory bowel disease populations show that 
often the greatest psychological burden is seen in patients 
with active disease or those with quiescent disease with 
ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms in the absence of

infl
 ammation,8,10 suggesting that these subgroups of 
patients might benefi
 t most from these types of treatment. 
Only one RCT did a subgroup analysis in patients with 
functional symptoms that met criteria for irritable bowel 
syndrome, in patients with quiescent disease.29 In that 
RCT, quality-of-life scores in those receiving mindfulness-
based therapy were signifi
 cantly improved when 
compared with control after 4 months of follow-up and 
remained higher during the entire 12 months of the study, 
although this diff
 erence was no longer signifi
 cant. 
Additionally, symptom scores were generally lower among 
those assigned to psychological therapy throughout the 
entire 12 months of the study. Finally, none of the included 
RCTs investigated the eff
 ect of psychological interventions 
in patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease with 
pre-existing depression or anxiety, despite evidence 
existing for a benefi
 t in this distinct group of patients, 
particularly in paediatric populations.46,51,52
In addition to the outcomes addressed in this systematic 
review and meta-analysis, fatigue is now recognised as an 
increasing problem in people with infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease and is more prevalent than in the general 
population, aff
 ecting up to 40% of patients.53,54 Furthermore, 
fatigue might be associated with depression and reduced 
quality of life, independent of disease activity.55,56 Only 
two of the studies that we identifi
 ed sought to investigate 
the eff
 ect of psychological therapies in this particular 
subgroup of patients with infl
 ammatory bowel disease,32,33 
randomly allocating patients in clinical remission with 
raised fatigue scores to receive solution-focused therapy, 
problem-solving therapy, or treatment as usual. In the 
larger of these two studies,33 signifi
 cant improvements in 
fatigue scores and quality of life were observed after 
3 months of follow-up in the intervention group, 
suggesting that psychological therapy might be benefi
 cial 
in this particular population.
The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis 
suggest that psychological therapy and CBT in particular 
might be of small short-term benefi
 t in terms of 
improvements in depression and quality of life in patients 
with infl
 ammatory bowel disease. However, despite several 
hundred patients in most of the analyses that we did, we 
could not detect any benefi
 cial eff
 ect of psychological 
therapies on disease activity or other measures of 
psychological health, including anxiety or stress. Despite 
this fi
 nding, a need remains for further investigation of the 
use of these interventions, particularly in patients who are 
likely to experience coexistent psychological distress 
or fatigue. Additionally, with increasing use of faecal 
biomarkers of intestinal infl
 ammation, such as calprotectin, 
as a means of objective assessment of disease activity, 
increasing numbers of patients with infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease with ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms in the 
absence of infl
 ammation will probably be identifi
 ed. This 
distinct cohort of patients also has unmet needs in terms of 
therapy and are often diffi
  cult to manage. Trials assessing 
the eff
 ects of psychological therapies, which use an 
adequate number of therapy sessions, have a suffi
  cient 
duration of follow-up, use masked assessors for endpoint 
assessment, and focus on the effi
  cacy of CBT in these 
patients, would therefore also be welcome.
